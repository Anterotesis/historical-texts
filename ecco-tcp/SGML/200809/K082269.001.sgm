<P>THE indulgence &s;hewn by the Public to EVELINA, which, un|patronized, unaided, and unowned, pa&s;t through Four Editions in one Year, has encouraged its Author to ri&s;k this SECOND attempt. The animation of &s;ucce&s;s is too univer&s;ally acknowledg|ed, to make the writer of the follow|ing &s;heets dread much cen&s;ure of te|merity; though the precariou&s;ne&s;s of any power to give plea&s;ure, &s;uppre&s;&s;es all vanity of confidence, and &s;ends CECILIA into the world with &s;carce more hope, though far more encou|ragement, than attended her highly-honoured predece&s;&s;or, EVELINA.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. A JOURNEY.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">"PEACE to the &s;pirits of my ho|noured parents, re&s;pected be their remains, and immortalized their virtues! may time, while it moulders their frail relicks to du&s;t, commit to tradition the re|cord of their goodne&s;s; and Oh may their orphan-de&s;cendant be influenced through life by the remembrance of their purity, and be &s;olaced in death, that by her it was un&s;ullied!"</Q></P>
<P>Such was the &s;ecret prayer with which the only &s;urvivor of the Beverley family quitted the abode of her youth, and re&s;i|dence of her forefathers; while tears of re|collecting &s;orrow filled her eyes, and ob|&s;tructed
<PB N="4" REF="4">
the la&s;t view of her native town which had excited them.</P>
<P>Cecilia, this fair traveller, had lately en|tered into the one-and-twentieth year of her age. Her ance&s;tors had been rich farmers in the county of Suffolk, though her father, in whom a &s;pirit of elegance had &s;up|planted the rapacity of wealth, had &s;pent his time as a private country gentleman, &s;atisfied, without increa&s;ing his &s;tore, to live upon what he inherited from the la|bours of his predece&s;&s;ors. She had lo&s;t him in her early youth, and her mother had not long &s;urvived him. They had be|queathed to her 10,000<HI>l.</HI> and con&s;igned her to the care of the Dean of &mdash;, her uncle. With this gentleman, in whom, by various contingencies, the accumulated po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of a ri&s;ing and pro&s;perous fa|mily were centred, &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t four years of her life; and a few weeks only had yet elap&s;ed &s;ince his death, which, by depriving her of her la&s;t relation, made her heire&s;s to an e&s;tate of 3000<HI>l.</HI> per annum; with no other re&s;triction than that of annexing her name, if &s;he married, to the di&s;po&s;al of her hand and her riches.</P>
<P>But though thus largely indebted to for|tune, to nature &s;he had yet greater obliga|tions: her form was elegant, her heart was liberal; her countenance announced the in|telligence
<PB N="5" REF="5">
of her mind, her complexion varied with every emotion of her &s;oul, and her eyes, the heralds of her &s;peech, now beamed with under&s;tanding and now gli&s;|tened with &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>For the &s;hort period of her minority, the management of her fortune and the care of her per&s;on, had by the Dean been entru&s;ted to three guardians, among whom her own choice was to &s;ettle her re&s;idence: but her mind, &s;addened by the lo&s;s of all her na|tural friends, coveted to regain its &s;erenity in the quietne&s;s of the country, and in the bo&s;om of an aged and maternal coun&s;ellor, whom &s;he loved as her mother, and to whom &s;he had been known from her child|hood.</P>
<P>The Deanery, indeed, &s;he was obliged to relinqui&s;h, a long repining expectant being eager, by entering it, to bequeath to ano|ther the anxiety and &s;u&s;pence he had &s;uffered him&s;elf; though probably without much impatience to &s;horten their duration in fa|vour of the next &s;ucce&s;&s;or; but the hou&s;e of Mrs. Charlton, her benevolent friend, was open for her reception, and the alleviating tenderne&s;s of her conver&s;ation took from her all wi&s;h of changing it.</P>
<P>Here &s;he had dwelt &s;ince the interment of her uncle; and here, from the affectionate gratitude of her di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he had per|haps
<PB N="6" REF="6">
been content to dwell till her own, had not her guardians interfered to remove her.</P>
<P>Reluctantly &s;he complied; &s;he quitted her early companions, the friend &s;he mo&s;t revered, and the &s;pot which contained the relicks of all &s;he had yet lived to lament; and, accompanied by one of her guardians, and attended by two &s;ervants, &s;he began her journey from Bury to London.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel, this gentleman, though in the prime of his life, though gay, fa&s;hion|able and &s;plendid, had been appointed by her uncle to be one of her tru&s;tees; a choice which had for object the peculiar gratification of his niece, who&s;e mo&s;t fa|vourite young friend Mr. Harrel had mar|ried, and in who&s;e hou&s;e he therefore knew &s;he would mo&s;t wi&s;h to live.</P>
<P>Whatever good-nature could dictate or politene&s;s &s;ugge&s;t to di&s;pel her melancholy, Mr. Harrel failed not to urge; and Cecilia, in who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition &s;weetne&s;s was tempered with dignity, and gentlene&s;s with fortitude, &s;uffered not his kind offices to &s;eem ineffec|tual; &s;he ki&s;&s;ed her hand at the la&s;t glimp&s;e a friendly hill afforded of her native town, and made an effort to forget the regret with which &s;he lo&s;t &s;ight of it. She revived her &s;pirits by plans of future happine&s;s, dwelt upon the delight with which &s;he &s;hould
<PB N="7" REF="7">
meet her young friend, and, by accepting his con&s;olation, amply rewarded his trouble.</P>
<P>Her &s;erenity, however, had yet another, though milder trial to undergo, &s;ince ano|ther friend was yet to be met, and another farewel was yet to be taken.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of &s;even miles from Bury re&s;ided Mr. Monckton, the riche&s;t and mo&s;t powerful man in that neighbourhood, at who&s;e hou&s;e Cecilia and her guardian were invited to breakfa&s;t in their journey.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, who was the younger &s;on of a noble family, was a man of parts, information and &s;agacity; to great native &s;trength of mind he added a penetrating knowledge of the world, and to faculties the mo&s;t &s;kilful of inve&s;tigating the cha|racter of every other, a di&s;&s;imulation the mo&s;t profound in concealing his own. In the bloom of his youth, impatient for wealth and ambitious of power, he had tied him|&s;elf to a rich dowager of quality, who&s;e age, though &s;ixty-&s;even, was but among the &s;maller &s;pecies of her evil properties, her di&s;po&s;ition being far more repul&s;ive than her wrinkles. An inequality of years &s;o con&s;iderable, had led him to expect that the fortune he had thus acquired, would &s;peedily be relea&s;ed from the burthen with which it was at pre&s;ent incumbered; but
<PB N="8" REF="8">
his expectations proved as vain as they were mercenary, and his lady was not more the dupe of his prote&s;tations than he was him|&s;elf of his own purpo&s;es. Ten years he had been married to her, yet her health was good, and her faculties were unimpaired; eagerly he had watched for her di&s;&s;olution, yet his eagerne&s;s had injured no health but his own! So &s;hort-&s;ighted is &s;elfi&s;h cunning, that in aiming no further than at the gratification of the pre&s;ent moment, it ob|&s;cures the evils of the future, while it im|pedes the perception of integrity and honour.</P>
<P>His ardour, however, to attain the ble&s;t period of returning liberty, deprived him neither of &s;pirit nor inclination for interme|diate enjoyment; he knew the world too well to incur it's cen&s;ure by ill-treating the woman to whom he was indebted for the rank he held in it; he &s;aw her, indeed, but &s;eldom, yet he had the decency, alike in avoiding as in meeting her, to &s;hew no abatement of civility and good breeding: but, having thus &s;acrificed to ambition all po&s;&s;ibility of happine&s;s in dome&s;tic life, he turned his thoughts to tho&s;e other methods of procuring it, which he had &s;o dearly purcha&s;ed the power of e&s;&s;aying.</P>
<P>The re&s;ources of plea&s;ure to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of wealth are only to be cut off by the &s;a|tiety
<PB N="9" REF="9">
of which they are productive: a &s;a|tiety which the vigorous mind of Mr. Monckton had not yet &s;uffered him to ex|perience; his time, therefore, was either devoted to the expen&s;ive amu&s;ements of the metropolis, or &s;pent in the country among the gaye&s;t of its diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>The little knowledge of fa&s;hionable man|ners and of the characters of the times of which Cecilia was yet mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he had gathered at the hou&s;e of this gentleman, with whom the Dean her Uncle had been intimately connected: for as he pre&s;erved to the world the &s;ame appearance of decency he &s;upported to his wife, he was every where well received, and being but parti|ally known, was extremely re&s;pected: the world, with its wonted facility, repaying his circum&s;pect attention to its laws, by &s;i|lencing the voice of cen&s;ure, guarding his character from impeachment, and his name from reproach.</P>
<P>Cecilia had been known to him half her life; &s;he had been care&s;&s;ed in his hou&s;e as a beautiful child, and her pre&s;ence was now &s;olicited there as an amiable acquain|tance. Her vi&s;its, indeed, had by no means been frequent, as the ill-humour of Lady Margaret Monckton had rendered them painful to her; yet the opportunities they had afforded her of mixing with peo|ple
<PB N="10" REF="10">
of fa&s;hion, had &s;erved to prepare her for the new &s;cenes in which &s;he was &s;oon to be a performer.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, in return, had always been a welcome gue&s;t at the Deanery; his conver&s;ation was to Cecilia a never-failing &s;ource of information, as his knowledge of life and manners enabled him to &s;tart tho&s;e &s;ubjects of which &s;he was mo&s;t ignorant; and her mind, copious for the admi&s;&s;ion and intelligent for the arrangement of knowledge, received all new ideas with avidity.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ure given in &s;ociety, like money lent in u&s;ury, returns with intere&s;t to tho&s;e who di&s;pen&s;e it: and the di&s;cour&s;e of Mr. Monckton conferred not a greater favour upon Cecilia than her attention to it repaid. And thus, the &s;peaker and the hearer being mutually gratified, they had always met with complacency, and commonly parted with regret.</P>
<P>This reciprocation of plea&s;ure had, how|ever, produced different effects upon their minds; the ideas of Cecilia were enlarged, while the reflections of Mr. Monckton were embittered. He here &s;aw an object who to all the advantages of that wealth he had &s;o highly prized, added youth, beauty, and intelligence; though much her &s;enior, he was by no means of an age to render his
<PB N="11" REF="11">
addre&s;&s;ing her an impropriety, and the en|tertainment &s;he received from his conver&s;a|tion, per&s;uaded him that her good opinion might with ea&s;e be improved into a regard the mo&s;t partial. He regretted the venal rapacity with which he had &s;acrificed him|&s;elf to a woman he abhorred, and his wi&s;hes for her final decay became daily more fer|vent. He knew that the acquaintance of Cecilia was confined to a circle of which he was him&s;elf the principal ornament, that &s;he had rejected all the propo&s;als of mar|riage which had hitherto been made to her, and, as he had &s;edulou&s;ly watched her from her earlie&s;t years, he had rea&s;on to be|lieve that her heart had e&s;caped any danger|ous impre&s;&s;ion. This being her &s;ituation, he had long looked upon her as his future property; as &s;uch he had indulged his admiration, and as &s;uch he had already appropriated her e&s;tate, though he had not more vigilantly in&s;pected into her &s;entiments, than he had guarded his own from a &s;imilar &s;crutiny.</P>
<P>The death of the Dean her Uncle had, indeed, much alarmed him; he grieved at her leaving Suffolk, where he con&s;idered him&s;elf the fir&s;t man, alike in parts and in con&s;equence, and he dreaded her re&s;iding in London, where he fore&s;aw that numer|ous rivals, equal to him&s;elf in talents and
<PB N="12" REF="12">
in riches, would &s;peedily &s;urround her; ri|vals, too, youthful and &s;anguine, not &s;hackled by pre&s;ent ties, but at liberty to &s;olicit her immediate acceptance. Beauty and independence, rarely found together, would attract a crowd of &s;uitors at once brilliant and a&s;&s;iduous; and the hou&s;e of Mr. Harrel was eminent for it's elegance and gaiety; but yet, undaunted by danger, and confiding in his own powers, he deter|mined to pur&s;ue the project he had formed, not fearing by addre&s;s and per&s;everance to en&s;ure its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. AN ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Monckton had, at this time, a party of company a&s;&s;embled at his hou&s;e for the purpo&s;e of &s;pending the Chri&s;t|mas holidays. He waited with anxiety the arrival of Cecilia, and flew to hand her from the chai&s;e before Mr. Harrel could alight. He ob&s;erved the melancholy of her countenance, and was much plea&s;ed to find that her London journey had &s;o little power to charm her. He conducted her to the breakfa&s;t parlour, where Lady Margaret and his friends expected her.</P>
<P>Lady Margaret received her with a cold|ne&s;s that bordered upon incivility; ira&s;cible by nature and jealous by &s;ituation, the ap|pearance of beauty alarmed, and of chear|fulne&s;s di&s;gu&s;ted her. She regarded with watchful &s;u&s;picion whoever was addre&s;&s;ed by her hu&s;band, and having marked his fre|quent attendance at the Deanery, &s;he had &s;ingled out Cecilia for the object of her pe|culiar antipathy; while Cecilia, perceiving her aver&s;ion though ignorant of its cau&s;e, took care to avoid all intercour&s;e with her
<PB N="14" REF="14">
but what ceremony exacted, and pitied in &s;ecret the unfortunate lot of her friend.</P>
<P>The company now pre&s;ent con&s;i&s;ted of one lady and &s;everal gentlemen.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bennet, the lady, was in every &s;en&s;e of the phra&s;e, the humble companion of Lady Margaret; &s;he was low-born, meanly educated, and narrow-minded; a &s;tranger alike to innate merit or acquired accomp|li&s;hments, yet &s;kilful in the art of flattery, and an adept in every &s;pecies of low cun|ning. With no other view in life than the attainment of affluence without labour, &s;he was not more the &s;lave of the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, than the tool of it's ma&s;ter; receiv|ing indignity without murmur, and &s;ubmit|ting to contempt as a thing of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Among the gentlemen, the mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous, by means of his dre&s;s, was Mr. Are&s;by, a captain in the militia; a young man who having frequently heard the words red-coat and gallantry put together, ima|gined the conjunction not merely cu&s;to|mary, but honourable, and therefore, with|out even pretending to think of the &s;ervice of his country, he con&s;idered a cockade as a badge of politene&s;s, and wore it but to mark his devotion to the ladies, whom he held him&s;elf equipped to conquer, and bound to adore,</P>
<P>The next who by forwardne&s;s the mo&s;t offi|cious
<PB N="15" REF="15">
took care to be noticed, was Mr. Mor|rice, a young lawyer, who, though ri&s;ing in his profe&s;&s;ion, owed his &s;ucce&s;s neither to di&s;|tingui&s;hed abilities, nor to &s;kill-&s;upplying indu&s;try, but to the art of uniting &s;upple|ne&s;s to others with confidence in him&s;elf. To a reverence of rank, talents, and fortune the mo&s;t profound, he joined an a&s;&s;urance in his own merit, which no &s;uperiority could depre&s;s; and with a pre&s;umption which en|couraged him to aim at all things, he blen|ded a good-humour that no mortification could le&s;&s;en. And while by the pliability of his di&s;po&s;ition he avoided making ene|mies, by his readine&s;s to oblige, he learned the &s;ure&s;t way of making friends by becom|ing u&s;eful to them.</P>
<P>There were al&s;o &s;ome neighbouring &s;quires; and there was one old gentleman, who, without &s;eeming to notice any of the company, &s;at frowning in a corner.</P>
<P>But the principal figure in the circle was Mr. Belfield, a tall, thin young man, who&s;e face was all animation, and who&s;e eyes &s;parkled with intelligence. He had been intended by his father for trade, but his &s;pirit, &s;oaring above the occupation for which he was de&s;igned, from repining led him to re&s;i&s;t, and from re&s;i&s;ting, to rebel. He eloped from his friends, and contrived to enter the army. But, fond of the po|lite
<PB N="16" REF="16">
arts, and eager for the acquirement of knowledge, he found not this way of life much better adapted to his inclination than that from which he had e&s;caped; he &s;oon grew weary of it, was reconciled to his father, and entered at the Temple. But here, too volatile for &s;erious &s;tudy, and too gay for laborious application, he made little progre&s;s: and the &s;ame quickne&s;s of parts and vigour of imagination which united with prudence, or accompanied by judg|ment, might have rai&s;ed him to the head of his profe&s;&s;ion, being unhappily a&s;|&s;ociated with &s;icklene&s;s and caprice, &s;erved only to impede his improvement, and ob|&s;truct his preferment. And now, with little bu&s;ine&s;s, and that little neglected, a &s;mall fortune, and that fortune daily becoming le&s;s, the admiration of the world, but that admiration ending &s;imply in civility, he lived an un&s;ettled and unprofitable life, ge|nerally care&s;&s;ed, and univer&s;ally &s;ought, yet carele&s;s of his intere&s;t and thoughtle&s;s of the future; devoting his time to company, his income to di&s;&s;ipation, and his heart to the Mu&s;es.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I bring you,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, as he attended Cecilia into the room, <Q REND="inline">"a &s;ubject of &s;orrow in a young lady who never gave di&s;turbance to her friends but in quitting them."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="17">
<Q REND="inline">"If &s;orrow,"</Q> cried Mr. Belfield, dart|ing upon her his piercing eyes, <Q REND="inline">"wears in your part of the world a form &s;uch as this, who would wi&s;h to change it for a view of joy?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She's divinely hand&s;ome, indeed!"</Q> cried the captain, affecting an involuntary exclamation.</P>
<P>Mean time, Cecilia, who was placed next to the lady of the hou&s;e, quietly began her breakfa&s;t; Mr. Morrice, the young lawyer, with the mo&s;t ea&s;y freedom, &s;eating him|&s;elf at her &s;ide, while Mr. Monckton was el&s;ewhere arranging the re&s;t of his gue&s;ts, in order to &s;ecure that place for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Morrice, without ceremony, at|tacked his fair neighbour; he talked of her journey, and the pro&s;pects of gaiety which it opened to her view; but by the&s;e find|ing her unmoved, he changed his theme, and expatiated upon the delights of the &s;pot &s;he was quitting. Studious to recom|mend him&s;elf to her notice, and indifferent by what means, one moment he flippantly extolled the entertainments of the town; and the next, rapturou&s;ly de&s;cribed the charms of the country. A word, a look &s;ufficed to mark her approbation or di&s;&s;ent, which he no &s;ooner di&s;covered, than he &s;lided into her opinion, with as much fa|cility
<PB N="18" REF="18">
and &s;atisfaction as if it had originally been his own.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing his chagrin, waited &s;ome time in expectation that when this young man &s;aw he was &s;tanding, he would yield to him his chair: but the re|mark was not made, and the re&s;ignation was not thought of. The captain, too, re|garding the lady as his natural property for the morning, perceived with indignation by whom he was &s;upplanted; while the company in general, &s;aw with much &s;ur|prize, the place they had &s;everally forborne to occupy from re&s;pect to their ho&s;t, thus familiarly &s;eized upon by the man who, in the whole room, had the lea&s;t claim, either from age or rank, to con&s;ult nothing but his own inclination.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, however, when he found that delicacy and good manners had no weight with his gue&s;t, thought it mo&s;t ex|pedient to allow them none with him&s;elf; and therefore, di&s;gui&s;ing his di&s;plea&s;ure un|der an appearance of facetiou&s;ne&s;s, he called out, <Q REND="inline">"Come, Morrice, you that love Chri&s;tmas &s;ports, what &s;ay you to the game of move-all?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I like it of all things!"</Q> an&s;wered Morrice, and &s;tarting from his chair, he &s;kipped to another.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So &s;hould I too,"</Q> cried Mr. Monck|ton,
<PB N="19" REF="19">
in&s;tantly taking his place, <Q REND="inline">"were I to remove from any &s;eat but this."</Q></P>
<P>Morrice, though he felt him&s;elf out|witted, was the fir&s;t to laugh, and &s;eemed as happy in the change as Mr. Monckton him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton now, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Cecilia, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"We are going to lo&s;e you, and you &s;eem concerned at leaving us; yet, in a very few months you will forget Bury, forget its inhabitants, and for|get its environs."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you think &s;o,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"mu&s;t I not thence infer that Bury, its in|habitants, and its environs, will in a very few months forget me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, ay, and &s;o much the better!"</Q> &s;aid Lady Margaret, muttering between her teeth, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o much the better!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry you think &s;o, madam,"</Q> cried Cecilia, colouring at her ill-breeding.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You will find,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, affecting the &s;ame ignorance of her mean|ing that Cecilia really felt, <Q REND="inline">"as you mix with the world, you will find that Lady Margaret has but expre&s;&s;ed what by almo&s;t every body is thought: to neglect old friends, and to court new acquaintance, though perhaps not yet avowedly deli|vered as a precept from parents to children, is neverthele&s;s &s;o univer&s;ally recommended
<PB N="20" REF="20">
by example, that tho&s;e who act differently, incur general cen&s;ure for affecting &s;ingu|larity."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is happy then, for me,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that neither my actions nor my|&s;elf will be &s;ufficiently known to attract public ob&s;ervation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You intend, then, madam,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"in defiance of the&s;e maxims of the world, to be guided by the light of your own under&s;tanding."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And &s;uch,"</Q> returned Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"at fir&s;t &s;etting out in life, is the inten|tion of every one. The clo&s;et rea&s;oner is always refined in his &s;entiments, and always confident in his virtue; but when he mixes with the world, when he thinks le&s;s and acts more, he &s;oon finds the nece&s;&s;ity of acco|modating him&s;elf to &s;uch cu&s;toms as are al|ready received, and of pur&s;uing quietly the track that is already marked out."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But not,"</Q> exclaimed Mr. Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"if he has the lea&s;t grain of &s;pirit! the beaten track will be the la&s;t that a man of parts will deign to tread,

<P><Q REND="inline">"A pernicious maxim! a mo&s;t perni|cious maxim!"</Q> cried the old gentleman, who &s;at frowning in a corner of the room.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="21">
<Q REND="inline">"Deviations from common rules,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, without taking any notice of this interruption, <Q REND="inline">"when they proceed from genius, are not merely pardonable, but admirable; and you, Belfield, have a peculiar right to plead their merits; but &s;o little genius as there is in the world, you mu&s;t &s;urely grant that pleas of this &s;ort are very rarely to be urged."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why rarely,"</Q> cried Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"but becau&s;e your general rules, your appropri|ated cu&s;toms, your &s;ettled forms, are but &s;o many ab&s;urd arrangements to impede not merely the progre&s;s of genius, but the u&s;e of under&s;tanding? If man dared act for him&s;elf, if neither worldly views, con|tracted prejudices, eternal precepts, nor compul&s;ive examples, &s;wayed his better rea&s;on and impelled his conduct, how noble indeed would he be! <HI>how infinite in facul|ties! in apprehen&s;ion how like a God!</HI>"<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hamlet.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All this,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"is but the doctrine of a lively imagin|ation, that looks upon impo&s;&s;ibilities &s;im|ply as difficulties, and upon difficulties as mere invitations to victory. But expe|rience teaches another le&s;&s;on; experience &s;hews that the oppo&s;ition of an individual to a community is always dangerous in the operation, and &s;eldom &s;ucce&s;sful in the
<PB N="22" REF="22">
event;&mdash;never, indeed, without a concur|rence &s;trange as de&s;irable, of fortunate cir|cum&s;tances with great abilities."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why is this,"</Q> returned Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"but becau&s;e the attempt is &s;o &s;eldom made? The pitiful prevalence of general conformity extirpates genius, and murders originality; man is brought up, not as if he were <Q REND="inline">"the noble&s;t work of God,"</Q> but as a mere ductile machine of human form|ation: he is early taught that he mu&s;t nei|ther con&s;ult his under&s;tanding, nor pur&s;ue his inclinations, left, unhappily for his com|merce with the world, his under&s;tanding &s;hould be aver&s;e to fools, and provoke him to de&s;pi&s;e them; and his inclinations to the tyranny of perpetual re&s;traint, and give him courage to abjure it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am ready enough to allow,"</Q> an|&s;wered Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"that an excentric genius, &s;uch, for example, as yours, may murmur at the tediou&s;ne&s;s of complying with the cu&s;toms of the world, and wi&s;h, un|confined, and at large, to range through life without any &s;ettled plan or prudential re&s;triction; but would you, therefore, grant the &s;ame licence to every one? would you wi&s;h to &s;ee the world peopled with defiers of order, and contemners of e&s;tabli&s;hed forms? and not merely excu&s;e the irregularities re|&s;ulting from uncommon parts, but encourage

tho&s;e, al&s;o, to lead, who without blunder|ing cannot even follow?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I would have <HI>all</HI> men,"</Q> replied Bel|field, <Q REND="inline">"whether philo&s;ophers or ideots, act for them&s;elves. Every one would then ap|pear what he is; enterprize would be en|couraged, and imitation aboli&s;hed; genius would feel its &s;uperiority, and folly its in|&s;ignificance; and then, and then only, &s;hould we cea&s;e to be &s;urfeited with that eternal &s;amene&s;s of manner and appearance which at pre&s;ent runs through all ranks of men."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Petrifying dull work this, <HI>mon ami!</HI>"</Q> &s;aid the captain, in a whi&s;per to Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>de grace,</HI> &s;tart &s;ome new game."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With all my heart,"</Q> an&s;wered he; and then, &s;uddenly jumping up, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"A hare! a hare!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Where?&mdash;where?&mdash;which way?"</Q> and all the gentlemen aro&s;e, and ran to different windows, except the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, the object of who&s;e pur&s;uit was already near him.</P>
<P>Morrice, with much pretended earne&s;t|ne&s;s, flew from window to window, to trace foot&s;teps upon the turf which he knew had not printed it: yet, never inattentive to his own intere&s;t, when he perceived in the mid&s;t of the combu&s;tion he had rai&s;ed, that Lady Margaret was incen&s;ed at the noi&s;e it produced,
<PB N="24" REF="24">
he artfully gave over his &s;earch, and &s;eating him&s;elf in a chair next to her, eagerly offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t her with cakes, cho|colate, or whatever the table afforded.</P>
<P>He had, however, effectually broken up the conver&s;ation; and breakfa&s;t being over, Mr. Harrel ordered his chai&s;e, and Cecilia aro&s;e to take leave.</P>
<P>And now not without &s;ome difficulty could Mr. Monckton di&s;gui&s;e the unea&s;y fears which her departure occa&s;ioned him. Taking her hand, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"you will not permit an old friend to vi&s;it you in town, le&s;t the &s;ight of him &s;hould prove a di&s;agreeable memorial of the time you will &s;oon regret having wa&s;ted in the country?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why will you &s;ay this, Mr. Monck|ton?"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure you can|not think it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The&s;e profound &s;tudiers of mankind, madam,"</Q> &s;aid Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"are mighty &s;orry champions for con&s;tancy or friend&s;hip. They wage war with all expectations but of depravity, and grant no quarter even to the pure&s;t de&s;igns, where they think there will be any temptation to deviate from them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Temptation,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"is very ea&s;y of re&s;i&s;tance in theory; but if you reflect upon the great change of &s;ituation Mi&s;s Beverley will experience,
<PB N="25" REF="25">
upon the new &s;cenes &s;he will &s;ee, the new acquaintance &s;he mu&s;t make, and the new connections &s;he may form, you will not wonder at the anxiety of a friend for her welfare."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But I pre&s;ume,"</Q> cried Belfield, with a laugh, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverly does not mean to convey her per&s;on to town, and leave her under&s;tanding locked up, with other na|tural curio&s;ities, in the country? Why, therefore, may not the &s;ame di&s;cernment regulate her adoption of new acquaintance, and choice of new connections, that guided her &s;election of old ones? Do you &s;uppo&s;e that becau&s;e &s;he is to take leave of you, &s;he is to take leave of her&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Where fortune &s;miles upon youth and beauty,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"do you think it nothing that their fair po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;hould make a &s;udden tran&s;ition of &s;ituation from the quietne&s;s of a retired life in the country, to the gaiety of a &s;plendid town re&s;idence?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Where fortune <HI>frowns</HI> upon youth and beauty,"</Q> returned Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"they may not irrationally excite commi&s;eration; but where nature and chance unite their forces to ble&s;s the &s;ame object, what room there may be for alarm or lamentation I confe&s;s I cannot divine."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What!"</Q> cried Mr. Monckton, with
<PB N="26" REF="26">
&s;ome emotion, <Q REND="inline">"are there not &s;harpers, fortune-hunters, &s;ycophants, wretches of all &s;orts and denominations, who watch the ap|proach of the rich and unwary, feed upon their inexperience, and prey upon their pro|perty?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come, come,"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"it is time I &s;hould ha&s;ten my fair ward away, if this is your method of de&s;cribing the place &s;he is going to live in."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible,"</Q> cried the Captain, ad|vancing to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that this lady has ne|ver yet tried the town?"</Q> and then, lowering his voice, and &s;miling langui&s;hingly in her face, he added <Q REND="inline">"Can any thing &s;o divinely hand&s;ome have been immured in the coun|try? Ah! <HI>quelle honte!</HI> do you make it a principle to be &s;o cruel?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, thinking &s;uch a compliment merited not any other notice than a &s;light bow, turned to Lady Margaret, and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Should your lady&s;hip be in town this winter, may I expect the honour of hearing where I may wait upon you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't know whether I &s;hall go or not;"</Q> an&s;wered the old lady, with her u&s;ual ungraciou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Cecilia would now have ha&s;tened away, but Mr. Monckton, &s;topping her, again ex|pre&s;&s;ed his fears of the con&s;equences of her journey; <Q REND="inline">"Be upon your guard,"</Q> he cried,
<PB N="27" REF="27">
<Q REND="inline">"with all new acquaintance; judge nobody from appearances; form no friend&s;hip ra&s;h|ly; take time to look about you, and re|member you can make no alteration in your way of life, without greater probability of faring wor&s;e, than chance of faring better. Keep therefore as you are, and the more you &s;ee of others, the more you will rejoice that you neither re&s;emble nor are connected with them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This from you, Mr. Monckton!"</Q> cried Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"what is become of your conformity &s;y&s;tem? I thought all the world was to be alike, or only &s;o much the wor&s;e for any variation?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;poke,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"of the world in general, not of this lady in particular; and who that knows, who that &s;ees her, would not wi&s;h it were po&s;&s;ible &s;he might continue in every re&s;pect exactly and unalterably what &s;he is at pre&s;ent?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I find,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"you are deter|mined that flattery at lea&s;t, &s;hould I meet with it, &s;hall owe no pernicious effects to its novelty."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> cried Mr. Har|rel, <Q REND="inline">"will you now venture to accompany me to town? Or has Mr. Monckton frightened you from proceeding any far|ther?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If,"</Q> replied Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I felt no more
<PB N="28" REF="28">
&s;orrow in quitting my friends, than I feel terror in venturing to London, with how light a heart &s;hould I make the journey!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Brava!"</Q> cried Belfield, <Q REND="inline">"I am happy to find the di&s;cour&s;e of Mr. Monckton has not intimidated you, nor prevailed upon you to deplore your condition in having the accumulated mi&s;ery of being young, fair and affluent."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas! poor thing!"</Q> exclaimed the old gentleman who &s;at in the corner, fixing his eyes upon Cecilia with an expre&s;&s;ion of mingled grief and pity.</P>
<P>Cecilia &s;tarted, but no one el&s;e paid him any attention.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual ceremonies of leave-taking now followed, and the Captain, with mo&s;t ob&s;equious reverence, advanced to conduct Cecilia to the carriage; but in the mid&s;t of the dumb eloquence of his bows and &s;miles, Mr. Morrice, affecting not to perceive his de&s;ign, &s;kipped gaily between them, and, without any previous formality, &s;eized the hand of Cecilia him&s;elf; failing not, how|ever, to temper the freedom of his action by a look of re&s;pect the mo&s;t profound.</P>
<P>The Captain &s;hrugged and retired. But Mr. Monckton, enraged at his a&s;&s;urance, and determined it &s;hould nothing avail him, exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"Why how now, Morrice, do you take away the privilege of my hou&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="29">
<Q REND="inline">"True, true;"</Q> an&s;wered Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"you members of parliament have an undoubted right to be tenacious of your privileges."</Q> Then, bowing with a look of veneration to Cecilia, he re&s;igned her hand with an air of as much happine&s;s as he had taken it.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, in leading her to the chai&s;e, again begged permi&s;&s;ion to wait up|on her in town: Mr. Harrel took the hint, and entreated him to con&s;ider his hou&s;e as his own; and Cecilia, gratefully thanking him for his &s;olicitude in her welfare, added <Q REND="inline">"And I hope, &s;ir, you will honour me with your coun&s;el and admonitions with re|&s;pect to my future conduct, whenever you have the goodne&s;s to let me &s;ee you."</Q></P>
<P>This was preci&s;ely his wi&s;h. He begged, in return, that &s;he would treat him with confidence, and then &s;uffered the chai&s;e to drive off.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. AN ARRIVAL.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as they lo&s;t &s;ight of the hou&s;e, Cecilia expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urpri&s;e at the behaviour of the old gentleman who &s;at in the corner, who&s;e general &s;ilence, &s;eclu&s;ion from the company, and ab&s;ence of mind, had &s;trongly excited her curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel could give her very little &s;a|tisfaction: he told her that he had twice or thrice met him in public places, where every body remarked the &s;ingularity of his manners and appearance, but that he had never di&s;cour&s;ed with any one to whom he &s;eemed known; and that he was as much &s;urpri&s;ed as her&s;elf in &s;eeing &s;o &s;trange a character at the hou&s;e of Mr. Monckton.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation then turned upon the family they had ju&s;t quitted, and Cecilia warmly declared the good opinion &s;he had of Mr. Monckton, the obligations &s;he owed to him for the intere&s;t which, from her childhood, he had always taken in her af|fairs; and her hopes of reaping much in&s;truc|tion from the friend&s;hip of a man who had &s;o exten&s;ive a knowledge of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="31">
Mr. Harrel profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf well &s;ati&s;|fied that &s;he &s;hould have &s;uch a coun&s;ellor; for though but little acquainted with him, he knew he was a man of fortune and fa|&s;hion, and well e&s;teemed in the world. They mutually compa&s;&s;ionated his unhappy &s;itu|ation in dome&s;tic life, and Cecilia inno|cently expre&s;&s;ed her concern at the di&s;like Lady Margaret &s;eemed to have taken to her; a di&s;like which Mr. Harrel naturally enough imputed to her youth and beauty, yet without &s;u&s;pecting any cau&s;e more co|gent than a general jealou&s;y of attractions of which &s;he had her&s;elf &s;o long outlived the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As their journey drew near to its conclu|&s;ion, all the unea&s;y and di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;a|tions which in the bo&s;om of Cecilia had ac|companied its commencement, gave way to the expectation of quick approaching happine&s;s in again meeting her favourite young friend.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel had in childhood been her playmate, and in youth her &s;chool-fel|low; a &s;imilarity of di&s;po&s;ition with re&s;pect to &s;weetne&s;s of temper, had early rendered them dear to each other, though the re&s;em|blance extended no farther, Mrs. Harrel having no preten&s;ions to the wit or under|&s;tanding of her friend; but &s;he was amiable and obliging, and therefore &s;ufficiently de|&s;erving
<PB N="32" REF="32">
affection, though neither blazing with attractions which laid claim to admira|tion, nor endowed with tho&s;e &s;uperior qua|lities which mingle re&s;pect in the love they in&s;pire.</P>
<P>From the time of her marriage, which was near three years, &s;he had entirely quit|ted Suffolk, and had had no intercour&s;e with Cecilia but by letter. She was now ju&s;t re|turned from Violet Bank, the name given by Mr. Harrel to a villa about twelve miles from London, where with a large party of company &s;he had &s;pent the Chri&s;tmas holi|days.</P>
<P>Their meeting was tender and affection|ate; the &s;en&s;ibility of Cecilia's heart flowed from her eyes, and the gladne&s;s of Mrs. Harrel's dimpled her cheeks.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as their mutual &s;alutations, ex|pre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s, and general enquiries had been made, Mrs. Harrel begged to lead her to the drawing-room, <Q REND="inline">"where,"</Q> &s;he added, <Q REND="inline">"you will &s;ee &s;ome of my friends, who are impatient to be pre&s;ented to you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I could have wi&s;hed,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"after &s;o long an ab&s;ence, to have pa&s;&s;ed this fir&s;t evening alone with you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They are all people who particularly de&s;ired to &s;ee you,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"and I had them by way of entertaining you, as I
<PB N="33" REF="33">
was afraid you would be out of &s;pirits at leaving Bury."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, finding the kindne&s;s of her in|tentions, forbore any further expo&s;tulation, and quietly followed her to the drawing|room. But as the door was opened, &s;he was &s;truck with amazement upon finding that the apartment, which was &s;pacious, lighted with brilliancy, and decorated with magnificence, was more than half filled with company, every one of which was dre&s;&s;ed with gaiety and profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who from the word friends, ex|pected to have &s;een a &s;mall and private party, &s;elected for the purpo&s;e of &s;ocial conver&s;e, &s;tarted involuntarily at the &s;ight before her, and had hardly courage to proceed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, however, took her hand and introduced her to the whole company, who were all &s;everally named to her; a ce|remonial which though not merely agree|able but even nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e who live in the gay world, in order to obviate di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing mi&s;takes, or unfortunate implications in di&s;cour&s;e, would by Cecilia have been willingly di&s;pen&s;ed with, &s;ince to her their names were as new as their per&s;ons, and &s;ince knowing nothing of their hi&s;tories, parties or connections, &s;he could to nothing allude: it therefore &s;erved but to heighten her colour and increa&s;e her embarra&s;sment.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="34">
A native dignity of mind, however, which had early taught her to di&s;tingui&s;h mode&s;ty from ba&s;hfulne&s;s, enabled her in a &s;hort time to conquer her &s;urpri&s;e, and recover her compo&s;ure. She entreated Mrs. Har|rel to apologize for her appearance, and be|ing &s;eated between two young ladies, endea|voured to &s;eem reconciled to it her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Nor was this very difficult; for while her dre&s;s, which &s;he had not changed &s;ince her journey, joined to the novelty of her face, attracted general ob&s;ervation, the report of her fortune, which had preceded her en|trance, &s;ecured to her general re&s;pect. She &s;oon found, too, that a company was not nece&s;&s;arily formidable becau&s;e full dre&s;&s;ed, that familiarity could be united with mag|nificence, and that though to her, every one &s;eemed attired to walk in a proce&s;&s;ion, or to grace a drawing-room, no formality was a&s;|&s;umed, and no &s;olemnity was affected: every one was without re&s;traint, even rank obtained but little di&s;tinction; ea&s;e was the general plan, and entertainment the ge|neral pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though new to London, which city the ill health of her uncle had hitherto prevented her &s;eeing, was yet no &s;tranger to company; &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed her time in re|tirement, but not in ob&s;curity, &s;ince for &s;ome years pa&s;t &s;he had pre&s;ided at the table
<PB N="35" REF="35">
of the Dean, who was vi&s;ited by the fir&s;t people of the country in which he lived: and notwith&s;tanding his parties, which were frequent, though &s;mall, and elegant, though private, had not prepared her for the &s;plendour or the diver&s;ity of a London a&s;&s;embly, they yet, by initiating her in the practical rules of good breeding, had taught her to &s;ubdue the timid fears of total inexperience, and to repre&s;s the ba&s;hful feelings of &s;hame-faced awkwardne&s;s; fears and feelings which rather call for compa&s;|&s;ion than admiration, and which, except in extreme youth, &s;erve but to degrade the mode&s;ty they indicate.</P>
<P>She regarded, therefore, the two young la|dies between whom &s;he was &s;eated, rather with a wi&s;h of addre&s;&s;ing, than a &s;hyne&s;s of being attacked by them; but the elder, Mi&s;s Larolles, was earne&s;tly engaged in di&s;cour&s;e with a gentleman, and the younger, Mi&s;s Lee&s;on, totally di&s;couraged her, by the invariable &s;ilence and gravity with which from time to time &s;he met her eyes.</P>
<P>Uninterrupted, therefore, except by oc|ca&s;ional &s;peeches from Mr. and Mrs. Har|rel, &s;he &s;pent the fir&s;t part of the evening merely in &s;urveying the company.</P>
<P>Nor was the company dilatory in return|ing her notice, &s;ince from the time of her
<PB N="36" REF="36">
entrance into the room, &s;he had been the ob|ject of general regard.</P>
<P>The ladies took an exact inventory of her dre&s;s, and internally &s;ettled how differ|ently they would have been attired if ble&s;t with equal affluence.</P>
<P>The men di&s;puted among them&s;elves whether or not &s;he was painted; and one of them a&s;&s;erting boldly that &s;he <HI>rouged well,</HI> a debate en&s;ued, which ended in a bet, and the deci&s;ion was mutually agreed to depend upon the colour of her cheeks by the be|ginning of April, when, if unfaded by bad hours and continual di&s;&s;ipation, they wore the &s;ame bright bloom with which they were now glowing, her champion acknow|ledged that his wager would be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>In about half an hour the gentleman with whom Mi&s;s Larolles had been talking, left the room, and then that young lady, turning &s;uddenly to Cecilia, exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"How odd Mr. Meadows is! Do you know he &s;ays he &s;han't be well enough to go to Lady Nyland's a&s;&s;embly! How ridi|culous! as if that could hurt him."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;urpri&s;ed at an attack &s;o little ce|remonious, lent her a civil, but &s;ilent atten|tion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;hall be there, &s;ha'n't you?"</Q> She added.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="37">
<Q REND="inline">"No, ma'am, I have not the honour of being at all known to her lady&s;hip."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O there's nothing in that,"</Q> returned &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"for Mrs. Harrel can acquaint her you are here, and then, you know, &s;he'll &s;end you a ticket, and then you can go."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A ticket?"</Q> repeated Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"does Lady Nyland only admit her company with tickets?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O lord,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, laugh|ing immoderately, <Q REND="inline">"don't you know what I mean? Why a ticket is only a vi&s;iting card, with a name upon it; but we all call them tickets now."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia thanked her for the information, and then Mi&s;s Larolles enquired how many miles &s;he had travelled &s;ince morning?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Seventy-three,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"which I hope will plead my apology for being &s;o little dre&s;&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, you're va&s;tly well,"</Q> returned the other, <Q REND="inline">"and for my part, I never think about dre&s;s. But only conceive what hap|pened to me la&s;t year! Do you know I came to town the twentieth of March! was not that horrid provoking?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps &s;o,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"but I am &s;ure I cannot tell why."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not tell why?"</Q> repeated Mi&s;s La|rolles, <Q REND="inline">"why don't you know it was the very night of the grand private ma&s;querade

at Lord Dariens? I would not have mi&s;&s;ed it for the whole univer&s;e.

Only conceive what a di&s;tre&s;s! well, I &s;ent to every creature I knew for a ticket, but they all &s;aid there was not one to be had; &s;o I was ju&s;t like a mad creature&mdash;but about ten or eleven o'clock, a young lady of my particular acquaintance, by the greate&s;t good luck in the world happened to be taken &s;uddenly ill; &s;o &s;he &s;ent me her ticket,&mdash;was not that delightful?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For <HI>her,</HI> extremely!"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, laughing.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"then I was almo&s;t out of my wits with joy; and I went about, and got one of the &s;weete&s;t dre&s;&s;es you ever &s;aw. If you'll call upon me &s;ome morning, I'll &s;hew it you."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, not prepared for an invitation &s;o abrupt, bowed without &s;peaking, and Mi&s;s Larolles, too happy in talking her&s;elf to be offended at the &s;ilence of another, conti|nued her narration.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, but now comes the vile&s;t part of the bu&s;ine&s;s; do you know, when every thing el&s;e was ready, I could not get my hair-dre&s;&s;er! I &s;ent all over the town,&mdash;he was no where to be found; I thought I
<PB N="39" REF="39">
&s;hould have died with vexation; I a&s;&s;ure you I cried &s;o that if I had not gone in a ma&s;k, I &s;hould have been a&s;hamed to be &s;een. And &s;o, after all this mon&s;trous fa|tigue, I was forced to have my hair dre&s;&s;ed by my own maid, quite in a common way; was not it cruelly mortifying?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Why yes,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould think it was almo&s;t &s;ufficient to make you regret the illne&s;s of the young lady who &s;ent you her ticket."</Q></P>
<P>They were now interrupted by Mrs. Har|rel, who advanced to them followed by a young man of a &s;erious a&s;pect and mode&s;t demeanour, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am happy to &s;ee you both &s;o well engaged; but my brother has been reproaching me with pre&s;enting every body to Mi&s;s Beverley but him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I cannot hope,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Arnott, <Q REND="inline">that I have any place in the recollection of Mi&s;s Beverley, but long as I have been ab&s;ent from Suffolk, and unfortunate as I was in not &s;eeing her during my la&s;t vi&s;it there, I am yet &s;ure, even at this di&s;tance of time, grown and formed as &s;he is, I &s;hould in&s;tantly have known her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Amazing!"</Q> cried an elderly gentle|man, in a tone of irony, who was &s;tanding near them, <Q REND="inline">"for the face is a very com|mon one!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I remember well,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that
<PB N="40" REF="40">
when you left Suffolk I thought I had lo&s;t my be&s;t friend."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is that po&s;&s;ible?"</Q> cried Mr. Arnott, with a look of much delight.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, indeed, and not without rea&s;on, for in all di&s;putes you were my advocate; in all plays, my companion; and in all difficulties, my a&s;&s;i&s;tant."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Madam,"</Q> cried the &s;ame gentleman, <Q REND="inline">"if you liked him becau&s;e he was your ad|vocate, companion, and a&s;&s;i&s;tant, pray like me too, for I am ready to become all three at once."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are very good,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"but at pre&s;ent I find no want of any defender."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's pity,"</Q> he returned, <Q REND="inline">"for Mr. Arnott &s;eems to me very willing to act the &s;ame parts over again with you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But for that purpo&s;e he mu&s;t return to the Days of his childhood."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, would to heaven it were po&s;&s;ible!"</Q> cried Mr. Arnott, <Q REND="inline">"for they were the hap|pie&s;t of my life."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"After &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion,"</Q> &s;aid his com|panion, <Q REND="inline">"&s;urely you will let him attempt to renew them? 'tis but taking a walk backwards; and though it is very early in life for Mr. Arnott to &s;igh for that retro|gade motion, which, in the regular cour&s;e of things, we &s;hall all in our turns de&s;ire,
<PB N="41" REF="41">
yet with &s;uch a motive as recovering Mi&s;s Beverley for a playfellow, who can wonder that he anticipates in youth the hopele&s;s wi&s;hes of age?"</Q></P>
<P>Here Mi&s;s Larolles, who was one of that numerous tribe of young ladies to whom all conver&s;ation is irk&s;ome in which they are not them&s;elves engaged, quitted her place, of which Mr. Go&s;port, Cecilia's new acquaintance, immediately took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it utterly impo&s;&s;ible,"</Q> continued this gentleman, <Q REND="inline">"that I &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t in procuring Mr. Arnott &s;uch a renovation? Is there no &s;ubaltern part I can perform to facilitate the project? for I will either <HI>hide</HI> or <HI>&s;eek</HI> with any boy in the Pari&s;h; and for a <HI>Q in the corner,</HI> there is none more ce|lebrated."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have no doubt, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Ceci|lia, <Q REND="inline">"of your accompli&s;hments: and I &s;hould be not a little entertained with the &s;urprize of the company if you could per|&s;uade your&s;elf to di&s;play them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"could the company do half &s;o well as to ari&s;e al&s;o, and join in the &s;port? it would but inter|rupt &s;ome tale of &s;candal, or &s;ome de&s;crip|tion of a <HI>to&ucirc;p&eacute;e.</HI> Active wit, however de|&s;picable when compared with intellec|tual, is yet &s;urely better than the in&s;igni|ficant
<PB N="42" REF="42">
click-clack of modi&s;h conver&s;ation,"</Q> ca&s;ting his eyes towards Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"or even the pen&s;ive dullne&s;s of affected &s;ilence,"</Q> changing their direction towards Mi&s;s Lee&s;on.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though &s;urprized at an attack upon the &s;ociety her friend had &s;elected, by one who was admitted to make a part of it, felt its ju&s;tice too &s;trongly to be of|fended at its &s;everity.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have often wi&s;hed,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"that when large parties are collected, as here, without any po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on why they might not as well be &s;eparated, &s;omething could be propo&s;ed in which each per&s;on might innocently take a &s;hare: for &s;urely after the fir&s;t half hour, they can find little new to ob&s;erve in the dre&s;s of their neigh|bours, or to di&s;play in their own; and with whatever &s;eeming gaiety they may contrive to fill up the middle and end of the evening, by wire-drawing the com|ments afforded by the beginning, they are yet &s;o mi&s;erably fatigued, that if they have not four or five places to run to every night, they &s;uffer nearly as much from wearine&s;s of their friends in company, as they would do from wearine&s;s of them|&s;elves in &s;olitude."</Q></P>
<P>Here, by the general breaking up of the party, the conver&s;ation was interrupted,
<PB N="43" REF="43">
and Mr. Go&s;port was obliged to make his exit; not much to the regret of Cecilia, who was impatient to be alone with Mrs. Harrel.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the evening, therefore, was &s;pent much more to her &s;atisfaction; it was devoted to friend&s;hip, to mutual en|quiries, to kind congratulations, and en|dearing recollections; and though it was late when &s;he retired, &s;he retired with re|luctance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. A SKETCH OF HIGH LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>EAGER to renew a conver&s;ation which had afforded her &s;o much plea&s;ure, Cecilia, neither &s;en&s;ible of fatigue from her change of hours nor her journey, aro&s;e with the light, and as &s;oon as &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed, ha&s;tened to the breakfa&s;t apart|ment.</P>
<P>She had not, however, been more impa|tient to enter than &s;he &s;oon became to quit it; for though not much &s;urprized to find her&s;elf there before her friend, her ardour for waiting her arrival was &s;omewhat chil|led, upon finding the fire but ju&s;t lighted, the room cold, and the &s;ervants &s;till em|ployed in putting it in order.</P>
<P>At 10 o'clock &s;he made another attempt: the room was then better prepared for her reception, but &s;till it was empty. Again &s;he was retiring, when the appearance of Mr. Arnott &s;topt her.</P>
<P>He expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize at her early ri&s;ing, in a manner that marked the plea|&s;ure it gave to him; and then, returning to the conver&s;ation of the preceding even|ing,
<PB N="45" REF="45">
he expatiated with warmth and feel|ing upon the happine&s;s of his boyi&s;h days, remembered every circum&s;tance belonging to the plays in which they had formerly been companions, and dwelt upon every incident with a minutene&s;s of delight that &s;hewed his unwillingne&s;s ever to have done with the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e detained her till they were joined by Mrs. Harrel, and then another, more gay and more general &s;ucceeded to it.</P>
<P>During their breakfa&s;t, Mi&s;s Larolles was announced as a vi&s;itor to Cecilia, to whom &s;he immediately advanced with the intimacy of an old acquaintance, taking her hand, and a&s;&s;uring her &s;he could no longer defer the honour of waiting upon her.</P>
<P>Cecilia, much amazed at this warmth of civility from one to whom &s;he was almo&s;t a &s;tranger, received her compliment rather coldly; but Mi&s;s Larolles, without con|&s;ulting her looks, or attending to her man|ner, proceeded to expre&s;s the earne&s;t de&s;ire &s;he had long had to be known to her; to hope they &s;hould meet very often; to de|clare nothing could make her &s;o happy; and to beg leave to recommend to her no|tice her own milliner.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I a&s;&s;ure you,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he has all Paris in her di&s;po&s;al; the &s;weete&s;t
<PB N="46" REF="46">
caps! the mo&s;t beautiful trimmings! and her ribbons are quite divine! It is the mo&s;t dangerous thing you can conceive to go near her; I never tru&s;t my&s;elf in her room but I am &s;ure to be ruined. If you plea&s;e, I'll take you to her this morning."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If her acquaintance is &s;o ruinous,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I think I had better avoid it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O impo&s;&s;ible! there's no &s;uch thing as living without her. To be &s;ure &s;he's &s;hockingly dear, that I mu&s;t own; but then who can wonder? She makes &s;uch &s;weet things, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to pay her too much for them."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel now joining in the recom|mendation, the party was agreed upon, and accompanied by Mr. Arnott, the ladies pro|ceeded to the hou&s;e of the milliner.</P>
<P>Here the raptures of Mi&s;s Larolles were again excited: &s;he viewed the finery di&s;|played with delight inexpre&s;&s;ible, enquired who were the intended po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, heard their names with envy, and &s;ighed with all the bitterne&s;s of mortification that &s;he was unable to order home almo&s;t every thing &s;he looked at.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed their bu&s;ine&s;s here, they proceeded to various other dre&s;s manufac|turers, in who&s;e prai&s;es Mi&s;s Larolles was almo&s;t equally eloquent, and to appropriate
<PB N="47" REF="47">
who&s;e goods &s;he was almo&s;t equally earne&s;t: and then, after attending this loquacious young lady to her father's hou&s;e, Mrs. Har|rel and Cecilia returned to their own.</P>
<P>Cecilia rejoiced at the &s;eparation, and congratulated her&s;elf that the re&s;t of the day might be &s;pent alone with her friend.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why no,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"not ab&s;olutely alone, for I expect &s;ome company at night."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Company again to-night?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, don't be frightened, for it will be a very &s;mall party; not more than fifteen or twenty in all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is that &s;o &s;mall a party?"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia, &s;miling; <Q REND="inline">"and how &s;hort a time &s;ince would you, as well as I, have rec|koned it a large one!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, you mean when I lived in the country,"</Q> returned Mrs. Harrel; <Q REND="inline">"but what in the world could I know of parties or company then?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not much, indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"as my pre&s;ent ignorance &s;hews."</Q></P>
<P>They then parted to dre&s;s for dinner.</P>
<P>The company of this evening were again all &s;trangers to Cecilia, except Mi&s;s Lee|&s;on, who was &s;eated next to her, and who&s;e frigid looks again compelled her to ob&s;erve the &s;ame &s;ilence &s;he &s;o re&s;olutely practi&s;ed her&s;elf. Yet not the le&s;s was her internal
<PB N="48" REF="48">
&s;urpri&s;e that a lady who &s;eemed deter|mined neither to give nor receive any en|tertainment, &s;hould repeatedly chu&s;e to &s;hew her&s;elf in a company with no part of which &s;he a&s;&s;ociated.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnott, who contrived to occupy the &s;eat on her other &s;ide, &s;uffered not the &s;ilence with which her fair neighbour had infected her to &s;pread any further: he talked, indeed, upon no new &s;ubject; and upon the old one, of their former &s;ports and amu&s;ements, he had already exhau&s;ted all that was worth being mentioned; but not yet had he exhau&s;ted the plea&s;ure he received from the theme; it &s;eemed always fre&s;h and always enchanting to him; it em|ployed his thoughts, regaled his imagin|ation, and enlivened his di&s;cour&s;e. Cecilia in vain tried to change it for another; he quitted it only by compul&s;ion, and returned to it with redoubled eagerne&s;s.</P>
<P>When the company was retired, and Mr. Arnott only remained with the ladies, Ce|cilia, with no little &s;urpri&s;e, enquired for Mr. Harrel, ob&s;erving that &s;he had not &s;een him the whole day.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> cried his lady, <Q REND="inline">"don't think of wondering at that, for it happens conti|nually. He dines at home, indeed, in ge|neral, but otherwi&s;e I &s;hould &s;ee nothing of him at all."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="49">
<Q REND="inline">"Indeed? why how does he fill up his time?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That I am &s;ure I cannot tell, for he never con&s;ults me about it; but I &s;uppo&s;e much in the &s;ame way that other people do."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah Pri&s;cilla!"</Q> cried Cecilia, with &s;ome earne&s;tne&s;s," <Q REND="inline">how little did I ever expect to &s;ee you &s;o much a fine lady!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A fine lady?"</Q> repeated Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"why what is it I do? don't I live exactly like every body el&s;e that mixes at all with the world?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You, Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Ar|nott in a low voice," <Q REND="inline">will I hope give to the world an example, not take one from it."</Q></P>
<P>Soon after, they &s;eparated for the night.</P>
<P>The next morning, Cecilia took care to fill up her time more advantageou&s;ly, than in wandering about the hou&s;e in &s;earch of a companion &s;he now expected not to find: &s;he got together her books, arranged them to her fancy, and &s;ecured to her&s;elf for the future occupation of her lei&s;ure hours, the exhau&s;tle&s;s fund of entertainment which reading, that riche&s;t, highe&s;t, and noble&s;t &s;ource of intellectual enjoyment, perpetu|ally affords.</P>
<P>While they were yet at breakfa&s;t, they were again vi&s;ited by Mi&s;s Larolles. <Q REND="inline">"I
<PB N="50" REF="50">
am come,"</Q> cried &s;he, eagerly, <Q REND="inline">"to run away with you both to my Lord Belgrade's &s;ale. All the world will be there; and we &s;hall go in with tickets, and you have no notion how it will be crowded."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What is to be &s;old there?"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O every thing you can conceive; hou&s;e, &s;tables, china, laces, hor&s;es, caps, every thing in the world."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And do you intend to buy any thing?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, no; but one likes to &s;ee the peo|ple's things."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then begged they would excu&s;e her attendance.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O by no means, cried Mi&s;s Larolles, you mu&s;t go, I a&s;&s;ure you; there'll be &s;uch a mon&s;trous crowd as you never &s;aw in your life. I dare &s;ay we &s;hall be half &s;queezed to death."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"is an induce|ment which you mu&s;t not expect will have much weight with a poor ru&s;tic ju&s;t out of the country: it mu&s;t require all the poli&s;h of a long re&s;idence in the metropolis to make it attractive."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O but do go, for I a&s;&s;ure you it will be the be&s;t &s;ale we &s;hall have this &s;ea&s;on. I can't imagine, Mrs. Harrel, what poor Lady Belgrade will do with her&s;elf; I hear the creditors have &s;eized every thing; I
<PB N="51" REF="51">
really believe creditors are the cruele&s;t &s;et of people in the world! they have taken tho&s;e beautiful buckles out of her &s;hoes! Poor &s;oul! I declare it will make my heart ache to &s;ee them put up. Its quite &s;hock|ing, upon my word. I wonder who'll buy them. I a&s;&s;ure you they were the prettie&s;t fancied I ever &s;aw. But come, if we don't go directly, there will be no getting in."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia again de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed ac|companying them, adding that &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;pend the day at home.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"At home, my dear?"</Q> cried Mrs. Har|rel;" <Q REND="inline">why we have been engaged to Mrs. Mears this month, and &s;he begged me to prevail with you to be of the party. I expect &s;he'll call, or &s;end you a ticket, every moment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How unlucky for me,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that you &s;hould happen to have &s;o many engagements ju&s;t at this time! I hope, at lea&s;t, there will not be any for to-mor|row."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes; to-morrow we go to Mrs. El|ton's."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Again to-morrow? and how long is this to la&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O heaven knows; I'll &s;hew you my catalogue."</Q></P>
<P>She then produced a book which con|tained a li&s;t of engagements for more than
<PB N="52" REF="52">
three weeks. <Q REND="inline">"And as the&s;e,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">are &s;truck off, new ones are made; and &s;o it is we go on till after the birth-day."</Q></P>
<P>When this li&s;t had been examined and commented upon by Mi&s;s Larolles, and viewed and wondered at by Cecilia, it was re&s;tored to its place, and the two ladies went together to the auction, permiting Cecilia, at her repeated reque&s;t, to return to her own apartment.</P>
<P>She returned, however, neither &s;atisfied with the behaviour of her friend, nor plea&s;ed with her own &s;ituation: the &s;obriety of her education, as it had early in&s;tilled into her mind the pure dictates of religion, and &s;trict principles of honour, had al&s;o taught her to regard continual di&s;&s;ipation as an introduction to vice, and unbounded extra|vagance as the harbinger of inju&s;tice. Long accu&s;tomed to &s;ee Mrs. Harrel in the &s;ame retirement in which &s;he had hitherto lived her&s;elf, when books were their fir&s;t amu&s;e|ment, and the &s;ociety of each other was their chief happine&s;s, the change &s;he now perceived in her mind and manners equally concerned and &s;urpri&s;ed her. She found her in&s;en&s;ible to friend&s;hip, indifferent to her hu&s;band, and negligent of all &s;ocial fe|licity. Dre&s;s, company, parties of plea&s;ure, and public places, &s;eemed not merely to occupy all her time; but to gratify all her
<PB N="53" REF="53">
wi&s;hes. Cecilia, in who&s;e heart glowed the warme&s;t affections and mo&s;t generous virtue, was cruelly depre&s;&s;ed and morti|fied by this di&s;appointment; yet &s;he had the good &s;en&s;e to determine again&s;t up|braiding her, well aware that if reproach has any power over indifference, it is only that of changing it into aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, in truth, was innocent of heart, though di&s;&s;ipated in life; married very young, &s;he had made an immediate tran&s;ition from living in a private family and a country town, to becoming mi&s;tre&s;s of one of the mo&s;t elegant hou&s;es in Port|man-&s;quare, at the head of a &s;plendid for|tune, and wife to a man who&s;e own pur|&s;uits &s;oon &s;hewed her the little value he him&s;elf &s;et upon dome&s;tic happine&s;s. Im|mer&s;ed in the fa&s;hionable round of com|pany and diver&s;ions, her under&s;tanding na|turally weak, was ea&s;ily dazzled by the bril|liancy of her &s;ituation; greedily, therefore, &s;ucking in air impregnated with luxury and extravagance, &s;he had &s;oon no plea&s;ure but to vie with &s;ome rival in elegance, and no ambition but to exceed &s;ome &s;uperior in expence.</P>
<P>The Dean of &mdash; in naming Mr. Har|rel for one of the guardians of his neice, had no other view than that of indulging her wi&s;hes by allowing her to re&s;ide in the
<PB N="54" REF="54">
hou&s;e of her friend: he had little per&s;onal knowledge of him, but was &s;atisfied with the nomination, becau&s;e acquainted with his family, fortune, and connections, all which per&s;uaded him to believe without further enquiry, that it was more peculiarly proper for his neice than any other he could make.</P>
<P>In his choice of the other two tru&s;tees he had been more prudent; the fir&s;t of the&s;e, the honourable Mr. Delvile, was a man of high birth and character; the &s;e|cond, Mr. Briggs, had &s;pent his whole life in bu&s;ine&s;s, in which he had already ama&s;|&s;ed an immen&s;e fortune, and had &s;till no greater plea&s;ure than that of encrea&s;ing it. From the high honour, therefore, of Mr. Delvile, he expected the mo&s;t &s;crupulous watchfulne&s;s that his neice &s;hould in no|thing be injured, and from the experience of Mr. Briggs in money matters, and his diligence in tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s, he hoped for the mo&s;t vigilant ob&s;ervance that her fortune, while under his care, &s;hould be turned to the be&s;t account. And thus, as far as he was able, he had equally con|&s;ulted her plea&s;ure, her &s;ecurity, and her pecuniary advantage.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel returned home only in time to dre&s;s for the re&s;t of the day.</P>
<P>When Cecilia was fummoned to dinner,

&s;he found, be&s;ides her ho&s;t and ho&s;te&s;s and Mr. Arnott, a gentleman &s;he had not be|fore &s;een, but who as &s;oon as &s;he entered the parlour, Mr. Harrel pre&s;ented to her, &s;aying at the &s;ame time he was one of the mo&s;t intimate of his friends.</P>
<P>This gentleman, Sir Robert Floyer, was about thirty years of age; his face was nei|ther remarkable for its beauty nor its ugli|ne&s;s, but &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed by its expre&s;&s;ion of invincible a&s;&s;urance; his per|&s;on, too, though neither &s;triking for its grace nor its deformity, attracted notice from the in&s;olence of his deportment. His manners, haughty and &s;upercilious, marked the high opinion he cheri&s;hed of his own importance; and his air and addre&s;s, at once bold and negligent, announced his happy perfection in the character at which he aimed, that of an accompli&s;hed man of the town.</P>
<P>The moment Cecilia appeared, &s;he be|came the object of his attention, though neither with the look of admiration due to her beauty, nor yet with that of curio&s;ity excited by her novelty, but with the &s;cru|tinizing ob&s;ervation of a man on the point of making a bargain, who views with fault-&s;eeking eyes the property he means to cheapen.</P>
<P>Cecilia, wholly unu&s;ed to an exa|mination
<PB N="56" REF="56">
&s;o little ceremonious, &s;hrunk aba&s;hed from his regards: but his conver|&s;ation was not le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ing to her than his looks; his principal &s;ubjects, which were hor&s;e-racing, lo&s;&s;es at play, and di&s;|putes at gaming-tables, could afford her but little amu&s;ement, becau&s;e &s;he could not under&s;tand them; and the epi&s;odes with which they were occa&s;ionally inter&s;per&s;ed, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of comparative &s;trictures upon celebrated beauties, hints of impend|ing bankruptcies, and wittici&s;ms upon re|cent divorces, were yet more di&s;agreeable to her, becau&s;e more intelligible. Wearied therefore, with unintere&s;ting anecdotes, and offended with injudicious &s;ubjects of plea|&s;antry, &s;he waited with impatience for the moment of retiring; but Mrs. Harrel, le&s;s eager, becau&s;e better entertained, was in no ha&s;te to remove, and therefore &s;he was compelled to remain quiet, till they were both obliged to ari&s;e, in order to fulfil their engagement with Mrs. Mears.</P>
<P>As they went together to the hou&s;e of that lady, in Mrs. Harrel's vis-&agrave;-vis, Ce|cilia, not doubting but their opinions con|cerning the Baronet would accord, in&s;tantly and openly declared her di&s;approbation of every thing he had uttered; but Mrs. Har|rel, far from confirming her expectations,
<PB N="57" REF="57">
only &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry you don't like him, for he is almo&s;t always with us?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you like him, then, your&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Extremely; he is very entertaining and clever, and knows the world."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How judiciou&s;ly do you prai&s;e him!"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"and how long might you deliberate before you could add another word to his panegyric!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, &s;atisfied to commend, with|out even attempting to vindicate him, was &s;oon content to change the &s;ubject; and Cecilia, though much concerned that the hu&s;band of her friend had made &s;o di&s;|graceful an election of a favourite, yet hoped that the lenity of Mrs. Harrel re|&s;ulted from her de&s;ire to excu&s;e his choice, not from her own approbation.</P>

<P>MRS. Mears, who&s;e character was of that common &s;ort which renders de|lineation &s;uperfluous, received them with the cu&s;tomary forms of good breeding.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel &s;oon engaged her&s;elf at a card-table: and Cecilia, who declined play|ing, was &s;eated next to Mi&s;s Lee&s;on, who aro&s;e to return the courte&s;y &s;he made in ad|vancing to her, but that pa&s;t, did not again even look at her.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though fond of conver&s;ation and formed for &s;ociety, was too diffident to at|tempt &s;peaking where &s;o little encouraged; they both, therefore, continued &s;ilent, till Sir Robert Floyer, Mr. Harrel, and Mr. Arnott entered the room together, and all at the &s;ame time advanced to Cecilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What,"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"don't you chu&s;e to play, Mi&s;s Beverley?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I flatter my&s;elf,"</Q> cried Mr. Arnott, <Q REND="inline">"that Mi&s;s Beverley never plays at all, for then, in one thing, I &s;hall have the honour to re&s;emble her."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="59">
<Q REND="inline">"Very &s;eldom, indeed,"</Q> an&s;wered Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"and con&s;equently very ill."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, you mu&s;t take a few le&s;&s;ons,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"Sir Robert Floyer, I am &s;ure, will be proud to in&s;truct you."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Robert who had placed him&s;elf oppo|&s;ite to her, and was &s;taring full in her face, made a &s;light inclination of his head, and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"certainly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould be a very unpromi&s;ing pupil,"</Q> returned Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"for I fear I &s;hould not only want diligence to improve, but de|&s;ire."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, you will learn better things,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Harrel; <Q REND="inline">"we have had you yet but three days among&s;t us,&mdash;in three months we &s;hall &s;ee the difference."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope not,"</Q> cried Mr. Arnott, <Q REND="inline">"I earne&s;tly hope there will be none!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Harrel now joined another party; and Mr. Arnott &s;eeing no &s;eat vacant near that of Cecilia, moved round to the back of her chair, where he patiently &s;tood for the re&s;t of the evening. But Sir Ro|bert &s;till kept his po&s;t, and &s;till, without troubling him&s;elf to &s;peak, kept his eyes fixed upon the &s;ame object.</P>
<P>Cecilia, offended by his boldne&s;s, looked a thou&s;and ways to avoid him; but her em|barra&s;&s;ment, by giving greater play to her features, &s;erved only to keep awake an at|tention
<PB N="60" REF="60">
which might otherwi&s;e have wearied. She was almo&s;t tempted to move her chair round and face Mr. Arnott, but though &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;hew her di&s;approbation of the Baronet, &s;he had not yet been reconciled by fa&s;hion to turning her back upon the company at large, for the indulgence of conver&s;ing with &s;ome particular per&s;on: a fa&s;hion which to unaccu&s;tomed ob&s;ervers &s;eems rude and repul&s;ive, but which, when once adopted, carries with it imperceptibly its own recommendation, in the ea&s;e, con|venience and freedom it promotes.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;agreeably &s;tationed, &s;he found but little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the neighbourhood of Mr. Arnott, &s;ince even his own de&s;ire of conver&s;ing with her, was &s;wallowed up by an anxious and involuntary impul&s;e to watch the looks and motions of Sir Robert.</P>
<P>At length quite tired of &s;itting as if merely an object to be gazed at, &s;he deter|mined to attempt entering into conver&s;ation with Mi&s;s Lee&s;on.</P>
<P>The difficulty, however, was not incon|&s;iderable how to make the attack; &s;he was unacquainted with her friends and connec|tions, uninformed of her way of think|ing, or her way of life, ignorant even of the found of her voice, and chilled by the coldne&s;s of her a&s;pect: yet, having no other alternative, &s;he was more willing to en|counter
<PB N="61" REF="61">
the forbidding looks of this lady, than to continue &s;ilently aba&s;hed under the &s;crutinizing eyes of Sir Robert.</P>
<P>After much deliberation with what &s;ub|ject to begin, &s;he remembered that Mi&s;s Larolles had been pre&s;ent the fir&s;t time they had met, and thought it probable they might be acquainted with each other; and therefore, bending forward, &s;he ventured to enquire if &s;he had lately &s;een that young lady?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Lee&s;on in a voice alike inexpre&s;&s;ive of &s;atisfaction or di&s;plea&s;ure, quietly an|&s;wered <Q REND="inline">"No, ma'am."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, di&s;couraged by this conci&s;ene&s;s, was a few minutes &s;ilent; but the per&s;eve|rance of Sir Robert in &s;taring at her, ex|citing her own in trying to avoid his eyes, &s;he exerted her&s;elf &s;o far as to add <Q REND="inline">"Does Mrs. Mears expect Mi&s;s Larolles here this evening?"</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Lee&s;on, without rai&s;ing her head, gravely replied <Q REND="inline">"I don't know, ma'am."</Q></P>
<P>All was now to be done over again, and a new &s;ubject to be &s;tarted, for &s;he could &s;ug|ge&s;t nothing further to a&s;k concerning Mi&s;s Larolles.</P>
<P>Cecilia had &s;een little of life, but that little &s;he had well marked, and her ob&s;er|vation had taught her, that among fa&s;hion|able people, public places &s;eemed a never-failing
<PB N="62" REF="62">
&s;ource of conver&s;ation and entertain|ment: upon this topic, therefore, &s;he hoped for better &s;ucce&s;s; and as to tho&s;e who have &s;pent more time in the country than in London, no place of amu&s;ement is &s;o inter|e&s;ting as a theatre, &s;he opened the &s;ubject &s;he had &s;o happily &s;ugge&s;ted, by an enquiry whether any new play had lately come out?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Lee&s;on, with the &s;ame dryne&s;s, only an&s;wered <Q REND="inline">"Indeed I can't tell."</Q></P>
<P>Another pau&s;e now followed, and the &s;pirits of Cecilia were con&s;iderably dampt; but happening accidentally to recollect the name of Almack, &s;he pre&s;ently revived, and, congratulating her&s;elf that &s;he &s;hould now be able to &s;peak of a place too fa&s;hion|able for di&s;dain, &s;he a&s;ked her, in a manner &s;omewhat more a&s;&s;ured, if &s;he was a &s;ub|&s;criber to his a&s;&s;emblies?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, ma'am."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you go to them con&s;tantly?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, ma'am."</Q></P>
<P>Again they were both &s;ilent. And now, tired of finding the ill &s;ucce&s;s of each parti|cular enquiry, &s;he thought a more general one might obtain an an&s;wer le&s;s laconic, and therefore begged &s;he would inform her what was the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable place of diver&s;ion for the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on?</P>
<P>This que&s;tion, however, co&s;t Mi&s;s Lee|&s;on no more trouble than any which had
<PB N="63" REF="63">
preceded it, for &s;he only replied <Q REND="inline">"Indeed I don't know."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now began to &s;icken of her at|tempt, and for &s;ome minutes to give it up as hopele&s;s; but afterwards when &s;he re|flected how frivolous were the que&s;tions &s;he had a&s;ked, &s;he felt more inclined to pardon the an&s;wers &s;he had received, and in a &s;hort time to fancy &s;he had mi&s;taken contempt for &s;tupidity, and to grow le&s;s angry with Mi&s;s Lee&s;on than a&s;hamed of her&s;elf.</P>
<P>This &s;uppo&s;ition excited her to make yet another trial of her talents for conver&s;ation, and therefore, &s;ummoning all the courage in her power, &s;he mode&s;tly apologi&s;ed for the liberty &s;he was taking, and then begged her permi&s;&s;ion to enquire whether there was any thing new in the literary way that &s;he thought worth recommending?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Lee&s;on now turned her eyes towards her, with a look that implied a doubt whether &s;he had heard right; and when the attentive attitude of Cecilia confirmed her que&s;tion, &s;urpri&s;e for a few in&s;tants took place of in&s;en&s;ibility, and with rather more &s;pirit than &s;he had yet &s;hewn, &s;he an&s;wered <Q REND="inline">"Indeed I know nothing of the matter."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was now utterly di&s;concerted; and half angry with her&s;elf, and wholly pro|voked with her &s;ullen neighbour, &s;he re|&s;olved to let nothing in future provoke her
<PB N="64" REF="64">
to a &s;imilar trial with &s;o unpromi&s;ing a &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>She had not, however, much longer to endure the examination of Sir Robert, who being pretty well &s;atisfied with &s;taring, turned upon his heel, and was &s;triding out of the room, when he was &s;topt by Mr. Go&s;|port, who for &s;ome time had been watching him.</P>
<P>Mr. Go&s;port was a man of good parts, and keen &s;atire: minute in his ob&s;ervations, and ironical in his expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So you don't play, Sir Robert?"</Q> he cried.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What here? No, I am going to Brookes's."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But how do you like Harrel's Ward? You have taken a pretty good &s;urvey of her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why faith I don't know; but not much, I think; &s;he's a devili&s;h fine woman too; but &s;he has no &s;pirit, no life."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did you try her? Have you talked to her?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not I, truly!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, then how do you mean to judge of her?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, faith, that's all over, now; one never thinks of talking to the women by way of trying them."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="65">
<Q REND="inline">"What other method, then, have you adopted?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"None."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"None? Why then how do you go on?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why they talk to us. The women take all that trouble upon them&s;elves now."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And pray how long may you have com|menced <HI>fade macaroni?</HI> For this is a part of your character with which I was not ac|quainted."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, hang it, 'tis not from <HI>ton;</HI> no, it's merely from lazine&s;s. Who the d&mdash;l will fatigue him&s;elf with dancing attendance upon the women, when keeping them at a di&s;tance makes them dance attendance up|on us?"</Q></P>
<P>Then &s;talking from him to Mr. Harrel, he took him by the arm, and they left the room together.</P>
<P>Mr. Go&s;port now advanced to Cecilia, and addre&s;&s;ing her &s;o as not to be heard by Mi&s;s Lee&s;on, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"I have been wi&s;hing to approach you, &s;ome time, but the fear that you are already overpowered by the lo|quacity of your fair neighbour makes me cautious of attempting to engage you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You mean,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"to laugh at <HI>my</HI> loquacity, and indeed its ill &s;ucce&s;s has rendered it &s;ufficiently ridiculous."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are you, then, yet to learn,"</Q> cried he,
<PB N="66" REF="66">
<Q REND="inline">"that there are certain young ladies who make it a rule never to &s;peak but to their own cronies? Of this cla&s;s is Mi&s;s Lee&s;on, and till you get into her particular Coterie, you mu&s;t never expect to hear from her a word of two &s;yllables. The TON mi&s;&s;es, as they are called, who now infe&s;t the town, are in two divi&s;ions, the SUPERCILIOUS, and the VO|LUBLE. The SUPERCILIOUS, like Mi&s;s Lee|&s;on, are &s;ilent, &s;cornful, languid, and affected, and di&s;dain all conver&s;e but with tho&s;e of their own &s;et: the VOLUBLE, like Mi&s;s La|rolles, are flirting, communicative, re&s;tle&s;s, and familiar, and attack without the &s;mall|e&s;t ceremony, every one they think worthy their notice. But this they have in com|mon, that at home they think of nothing but dre&s;s, abroad, of nothing but admira|tion, and that every where they hold in &s;u|preme contempt all but them&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Probably, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I have pa&s;&s;ed to night, for one of the VOLUBLES; however, all the advantage has been with the SUPERCILIOUS, for I have &s;uffered a total repul&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are you &s;ure, however, you have not talked too well for her?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, a child of five years old ought to have been whipt for not talking better!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But it is not capacity alone you are to con|&s;ult when you talk with mi&s;&s;es of the TON;
<PB N="67" REF="67">
were their under&s;tandings only to be con|&s;idered, they would indeed be wonderfully ea&s;y of acce&s;s! in order therefore, to ren|der their commerce &s;omewhat difficult, they will only be plea&s;ed by an ob&s;ervance of their humours: which are ever mo&s;t va|rious and mo&s;t exuberant where the intel|lects are weake&s;t and lea&s;t cultivated. I have, however, a receipt which I have found infallible for engaging the attention of young ladies of what&s;oever character or denomination."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, then,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"pray fa|vour me with it, for I have here an admi|rable opportunity to try its efficacy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will give it you,"</Q> he an&s;wered <Q REND="inline">"with full directions. When you meet with a young lady who &s;eems re&s;olutely determined not to &s;peak, or who, if compelled by a di|rect que&s;tion to make &s;ome an&s;wer, drily gives a brief affirmative, or coldly a laco|nic negative&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A ca&s;e in point!"</Q> interrupted Cecilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, thus circum&s;tanced,"</Q> he con|tinued, <Q REND="inline">"the remedy I have to propo&s;e con&s;i&s;ts of three topics of di&s;cour&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray what are they?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dre&s;s, public places, and love."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, half &s;urpri&s;ed and half diverted, waited a fuller explanation without giving any interruption.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="68">
<Q REND="inline">"The&s;e three topics,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"are to an&s;wer three purpo&s;es, &s;ince there are no le&s;s than three cau&s;es from which the &s;ilence of young ladies may proceed: &s;or|row, affectation, and &s;tupidity."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you, then,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"give nothing at all to mode&s;ty?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I give much to it,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"as an excu&s;e, nay almo&s;t as an equivalent for wit; but for that &s;ullen &s;ilence which re|&s;i&s;ts all encouragement, mode&s;ty is a mere pretence, not a cau&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t, however, be &s;omewhat more explicit, if you mean that I &s;hould benefit from your in&s;tructions."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well then,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"I will briefly enumerate the three cau&s;es, with di|rections for the three methods of cure. To begin with &s;orrow. The taciturnity which really re&s;ults from that is attended with an incurable ab&s;ence of mind, and a total un|con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the ob&s;ervation which it excites; upon this occa&s;ion, public places may &s;ometimes be tried in vain, and even dre&s;s may fail; but love&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are you &s;ure, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, with a laugh, <Q REND="inline">"that &s;orrow has but that one &s;ource?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By no means,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"for per|haps papa may have been angry, or mama may have been cro&s;s; a milliner may have
<PB N="69" REF="69">
&s;ent a wrong pompoon, or a chaperon to an a&s;&s;embly may have been taken ill;&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Bitter &s;ubjects of affliction, indeed! And are the&s;e all you allow us?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, I &s;peak but of young ladies of fa&s;hion, and what of greater importance can befall them? If, therefore, the grief of the fair patient proceeds from papa, mama, or the chaperon, then the mention of pub|lic places, tho&s;e endle&s;s incentives of di&s;|plea&s;ure between the old and the young, will draw forth her complaints, and her complaints will bring their own cure, for tho&s;e who lament find &s;peedy con&s;olation: if the milliner has occa&s;ioned the calamity, the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of dre&s;s will have the &s;ame effect; &s;hould both the&s;e medicines fail, love, as I &s;aid before, will be found infal|lible, for you will then have inve&s;tigated every &s;ubject of unea&s;ine&s;s which a youthful female in high life can experience."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They are greatly obliged to you,"</Q> cried Cecilia, bowing, <Q REND="inline">"for granting them motives of &s;orrow &s;o honourable, and I thank you in the name of the whole &s;ex."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You, madam,"</Q> &s;aid he, returning her bow, <Q REND="inline">"are I hope an exception in the hap|pie&s;t way, that of having no &s;orrow at all. I come, now, to the &s;ilence of affectation, which is pre&s;ently di&s;cernable by the rov|ing of the eye round the room to &s;ee if it
<PB N="70" REF="70">
is heeded, by the &s;edulous care to avoid an accidental &s;mile, and by the variety of di&s;|con&s;olate attitudes exhibited to the be|holders. This &s;pecies of &s;ilence has almo&s;t without exception its origin in that babyi&s;h vanity which is always gratified by exciting attention, without ever perceiving that it provokes contempt. In the&s;e ca&s;es, as na|ture is wholly out of the que&s;tion, and the mind is guarded again&s;t its own feelings, dre&s;s and public places are almo&s;t certain of failing, but here again love is &s;ure to van|qui&s;h; as &s;oon as it is named, attention be|comes involuntary, and in a &s;hort time a &s;truggling &s;imper di&s;compo&s;es the arrange|ment of the features, and then the bu&s;ine&s;s is pre&s;ently over, for the young lady is either &s;upporting &s;ome &s;y&s;tem, or oppo&s;ing &s;ome propo&s;ition, before &s;he is well aware that &s;he has been cheated out of her &s;ad &s;i|lence at all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So much,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"for &s;orrow and for affectation. Proceed next to &s;tu|pidity; for that, in all probability, I &s;hall mo&s;t frequently encounter."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That always mu&s;t be heavy work,"</Q> re|turned he, <Q REND="inline">"yet the road is plain, though it is all up hill. Love, here, may be talked of without exciting any emotion, or pro|voking any reply, and dre&s;s may be dilated upon without producing any other effect
<PB N="71" REF="71">
than that of attracting a vacant &s;tare; but public places are indubitably certain of &s;ucce&s;s. Dull and heavy characters, inca|pable of animating from wit or from rea|&s;on, becau&s;e unable to keep pace with them, and void of all internal &s;ources of entertainment, require the &s;timulation of &s;hew, glare, noi&s;e and bu&s;tle to intere&s;t or awaken them. Talk to them of &s;uch &s;ub|jects and they adore you; no matter whether you paint to them joy or horror, let there but be action, and they are content; a battle has charms for them equal to a coronation, and a funeral amu&s;es them as much as a wedding."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am much obliged to you,"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"for the&s;e in&s;tructions; yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s I know not how upon the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of them: public places I have already tried, but tried in vain; dre&s;s I dare not mention, as I have not yet learned its technical terms,&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well but,"</Q> interrupted he, <Q REND="inline">"be not de&s;perate; you have yet the third topic une&s;&s;ayed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O that,"</Q> returned &s;he laughing, <Q REND="inline">"I leave to you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"love is a &s;ource of loquacity only with your&s;elves: when it is &s;tarted by men, young ladies dwindle into mere li&s;teners. <HI>Simpering</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="72">
li&s;teners, I confe&s;s; but it is only with one another that you will di&s;cu&s;s its merits."</Q></P>
<P>At this time they were interrupted by the approach of Mi&s;s Larolles, who tripping towards Cecilia, exclaimed <Q REND="inline">"Lord how glad I am to &s;ee you! So you would not go to the auction? Well, you had a prodigious lo&s;s, I a&s;&s;ure you. All the wardrobe was &s;old, and all Lady Belgrade's trinkets. I never &s;aw &s;uch a collection of &s;weet things in my life. I was ready to cry that I could not bid for half an hundred of them. I de|clare I was kept in an agony the whole morning. I would not but have been there for the world. Poor Lady Belgrade! you really can't conceive how I was &s;hocked for her. All her beautiful things &s;old for al|mo&s;t nothing. I a&s;&s;ure you if you had &s;een how they went you would have lo&s;t all patience. It's a thou&s;and pities you were not there."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"On the contrary,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I think I had a very fortunate e&s;cape, for the lo&s;s of patience without the acqui&s;ition of the trinkets, would have been rather mor|tifying."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;port; <Q REND="inline">"but when you have lived &s;ome time longer in this commercial city, you will find the ex|change of patience for mortification the
<PB N="73" REF="73">
mo&s;t common and con&s;tant traffic among it's inhabitants."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray have you been here long?"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"for I have been to twenty places, wondering I did not meet with you before. But whereabouts is Mrs. Mears? O, I &s;ee her now; I'm &s;ure there's no mi&s;|taking her; I could know her by that old red gown half a mile off. Did you ever &s;ee &s;uch a frightful thing in your life? And it's never off her back. I believe &s;he &s;leeps in it. I am &s;ure I have &s;een her in nothing el&s;e all winter. It quite tires one's eye. She's a mon&s;trous &s;hocking dre&s;&s;er. But do you know, I have met with the mo&s;t pro|voking thing in the world this evening? I declare it has made me quite &s;ick. I was never in &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion in my life. You can conceive nothing like it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Like what?"</Q> cried Cecilia, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"your pa&s;&s;ion, or your provocation?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why I'll tell you what it was, and then you &s;hall judge if it was not quite pa&s;t en|durance. You mu&s;t know I commi&s;&s;ioned a particular friend of mine, Mi&s;s Moffat, to buy me a trimming when &s;he went to Paris; well, &s;he &s;ent it me over about a month ago by Mr. Meadows, and it's the &s;weete&s;t thing you ever &s;aw in your life; but I would not make it up, becau&s;e there was not a creature in town, &s;o I thought to
<PB N="74" REF="74">
bring it out quite new in about a week's time, for you know any thing does till af|ter Chri&s;tmas. Well, to night at Lady Jane Dranet's, who &s;hould I meet but Mi&s;s Moffat! She had been in town &s;ome days, but &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly engaged I could never find her at home. Well, I was quite de|lighted to &s;ee her, for you mu&s;t know &s;he's a prodigious favourite with me, &s;o I ran up to her in a great hurry to &s;hake hands, and what do you think was the fir&s;t thing that &s;truck my eyes? Why ju&s;t &s;uch a trimming as my own, upon a na&s;ty odious gown, and half dirty! Can you conceive any thing &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing? I could have cried with plea|&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why &s;o?"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"If her trimming is dirty, yours will look the more delicate."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O lord, but it's making it &s;eem quite an old thing! half the town will get &s;ome|thing like it. And I quite ruined my&s;elf to buy it. I declare I don't think any thing was ever half &s;o mortifying. It di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me &s;o I could hardly &s;peak to her. If &s;he had &s;tayed a month or two longer I &s;hould not have minded it, but it was the cruelle&s;t thing in the world to come over ju&s;t now. I wi&s;h the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e-officers had kept all her cloaths till &s;ummer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The wi&s;h is tender, indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia, <Q REND="inline">"for a <HI>particular friend.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="75">
Mrs. Mears now ri&s;ing from the card|table, Mi&s;s Larolles tript away to pay her compliments to her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Here, at lea&s;t,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"no receipt &s;eems requi&s;ite for the cure of &s;i|lence! I would have Mi&s;s Larolles be the con&s;tant companion of Mi&s;s Lee&s;on: they could not but agree admirably, &s;ince that SU|PERCILIOUS young lady &s;eems determined never to &s;peak, and the VOLUBLE Mi&s;s La|rolles never to be &s;ilent. Were each to borrow &s;omething of the other, how greatly would both be the better!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The compo&s;ition would &s;till be a &s;orry one,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Go&s;port, <Q REND="inline">"for I be|lieve they are equally weak, and equally ignorant; the only difference is, that one, though &s;illy, is quick, the other, though deliberate is &s;tupid. Upon a &s;hort acquain|tance, that heavine&s;s which leaves to others the whole weight of di&s;cour&s;e, and whole &s;earch of entertainment, is the mo&s;t fa|tiguing, but, upon a longer intimacy, even that is le&s;s irk&s;ome and le&s;s offen&s;ive, than the flippancy which hears nothing but it|&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel aro&s;e now to depart, and Cecilia, not more tired of the beginning of the evening than entertained with its con|clu&s;ion, was handed to the carriage by Mr. Arnott.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. A BREAKFAST.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning, during breakfa&s;t, a &s;ervant acquainted Cecilia that a young gentleman was in the hall, who begged to &s;peak with her. She de&s;ired he might be admitted; and Mrs. Harrel, laughing, a&s;ked if &s;he ought not to quit the room; while Mr. Arnott, with even more than his u&s;ual gravity, directed his eye towards the door to watch who &s;hould enter.</P>
<P>Neither of them, however, received any &s;atisfaction when it was opened, for the gentleman who made his appearance was unknown to both: but great was the amaze|ment of Cecilia, though little her emotion, when &s;he &s;aw Mr. Morrice!</P>
<P>He came forward with an air of the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect for the company in general, and ob&s;equiou&s;ly advancing to Cecilia, made an earne&s;t enquiry into her health after her journey, and hoped &s;he had heard good news from her friends in the country.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, naturally concluding both
<PB N="77" REF="77">
from his vi&s;it and behaviour, that he was an acquaintance of &s;ome intimacy, very ci|villy offered him a &s;eat and &s;ome breakfa&s;t, which, very frankly, he accepted. But Mr. Arnott, who already felt the anxiety of a ri&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion which was too full of veneration to be &s;anguine, looked at him with unea&s;ine&s;s, and waited his departure with impatience.</P>
<P>Cecilia began to imagine he had been commi&s;&s;ioned to call upon her with &s;ome me&s;&s;age from Mr. Monckton: for &s;he knew not how to &s;uppo&s;e that merely and acci|dentally having &s;pent an hour or two in the &s;ame room with her, would authorize a vi|&s;iting acquaintance. Mr. Morrice, how|ever, had a facility the mo&s;t happy of re|conciling his preten&s;ions to his inclina|tion; and therefore &s;he &s;oon found that the pretence &s;he had &s;ugge&s;ted appeared to him unnece&s;&s;ary. To lead, however, to the &s;ubject from which &s;he expected his excu&s;e, &s;he enquired how long he had left Suffolk?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But ye&s;terday noon, ma'am,"</Q> he an|&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"or I &s;hould certainly have taken the liberty to wait upon you before."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who had only been perplexing her&s;elf to devi&s;e &s;ome rea&s;on why he came at all, now looked at him with a grave &s;urprize, which would totally have aba&s;hed a man who&s;e courage had been le&s;s, or
<PB N="78" REF="78">
who&s;e expectations had been greater; but Mr. Morrice, though he hazarded every danger upon the &s;lighte&s;t chance of hope, knew too well the weakne&s;s of his claims to be confident of &s;ucce&s;s, and had been too familiar with rebuffs to be much hurt by receiving them. He might po&s;&s;ibly have &s;omething to gain, but he knew he had nothing to lo&s;e.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I had the plea&s;ure,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"to leave all our friends well, except poor lady Margaret, and &s;he has had an attack of the a&s;thma; yet &s;he would not have a phy&s;ician, though Mr. Monckton would fain have per&s;uaded her: however, I be|lieve the old lady knows better things."</Q> And he looked archly at Cecilia: but perceiving that the in&s;inuation gave her nothing but di&s;gu&s;t, he changed his tone, and added, <Q REND="inline">"It is amazing how well they live together; nobody would imagine the di&s;parity in their years. Poor old lady! Mr. Monckton will really have a great lo&s;s of her when &s;he dies."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A lo&s;s of her!"</Q> repeated Mrs. Har|rel, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure &s;he is an exceeding ill|natured old woman. When I lived at Bury, I was always frightened out of my wits at the &s;ight of her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why indeed, ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t own her appearance is rather
<PB N="79" REF="79">
again&s;t her: I had my&s;elf a great aver&s;ion to her at fir&s;t &s;ight. But the hou&s;e is chear|ful,&mdash;very chearful; I like to &s;pend a few days there now and then of all things. Mi&s;s Bennet, too, is agreeable enough, and &mdash;."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Bennet agreeable!"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"I think &s;he's the mo&s;t odious creature I ever knew in my life; a na&s;ty, &s;piteful old maid!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why indeed, ma'am, as you &s;ay,"</Q> an|&s;wered Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he is not very young; and as to her temper, I confe&s;s I know very little about it; and Mr. Monckton is likely enough to try it, for he is pretty &s;evere."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Monckton,"</Q> cried Cecilia, ex|tremely provoked at hearing him cen&s;ured by a man &s;he thought highly honoured in being permitted to approach him, <Q REND="inline">"when|ever <HI>I</HI> have been his gue&s;t, has merited from me nothing but prai&s;e and gratitude."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> cried Morrice eagerly, <Q REND="inline">"there is not a more worthy man in the world! he has &s;o much wit, &s;o much politene&s;s! I don't know a more charming man any where than my friend Mr. Monckton."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now perceiving that the opinions of her new acquaintance were as pliant as his bows, determined to pay him no fur|ther attention, and hoped by &s;itting &s;ilent to force from him the bu&s;ine&s;s of his vi&s;it,
<PB N="80" REF="80">
if any he had, or if, as &s;he now &s;u&s;pected, he had none, to weary him into a retreat.</P>
<P>But this plan, though it would have &s;uc|ceeded with her&s;elf, failed with Mr. Mor|rice, who to a &s;tock of good-humour that made him always ready to oblige others, added an equal portion of in&s;en&s;ibility that hardened him again&s;t all indignity. Find|ing, therefore, that Cecilia, to whom his vi&s;it was intended, &s;eemed already &s;atisfied with its length, he prudently forbore to torment her; but perceiving that the lady of the hou&s;e was more acce&s;&s;ible, he quickly made a transfer of his attention, and ad|dre&s;&s;ed his di&s;cour&s;e to her with as much plea&s;ure as if his only view had been to &s;ee her, and as much ea&s;e as if he had known her all his life.</P>
<P>With Mrs. Harrel this conduct was not injudicious; &s;he was plea&s;ed with his a&s;&s;i|duity, amu&s;ed with his vivacity, and &s;uffi|ciently &s;atisfied with his under&s;tanding. They conver&s;ed, therefore, upon pretty equal terms, and neither of them were yet tired, when they were interrupted by Mr. Harrel, who came into the room to a&s;k if they had &s;een or heard any thing of Sir Robert Floyer?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> an&s;wered Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"nothing at all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h he was hanged,"</Q> returned he,
<PB N="81" REF="81">
<Q REND="inline">"for he has kept me waiting this hour. He made me promi&s;e not to ride out till he called, and now he'll &s;tay till the morning is over."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray where does he live, Sir?"</Q> cried Morrice, &s;tarting from his &s;eat.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In Cavendi&s;h-&s;quare, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Harrel, looking at him with much &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Not a word more &s;aid Morrice, but &s;campered out of the room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray who is this Genius?"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"and what has he run away for?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Upon my word I know nothing at all of him,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Harrel; <Q REND="inline">"he is a vi|&s;itor of Mi&s;s Beverley's."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And I, too,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"might almo&s;t equally di&s;claim all knowledge of him; for though I once &s;aw, I never was introduced to him."</Q></P>
<P>She then began a relation of her meeting him at Mr. Monckton's hou&s;e, and had hardly concluded it, before again, and quite out of breath, he made his appearance.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir Robert Floyer, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid he to Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"will be here in two mi|nutes."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"you have not given your&s;elf the trouble of go|ing to him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, it has given me nothing but
<PB N="82" REF="82">
plea&s;ure; a run the&s;e cold mornings is the thing I like be&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir, you are extremely good,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"but I had not the lea&s;t intention of your taking &s;uch a walk upon my ac|count."</Q></P>
<P>He then begged him to be &s;eated, to re&s;t him&s;elf, and to take &s;ome refre&s;hment; which civilities he received without &s;cruple.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But, Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Harrel, turning &s;uddenly to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"you don't tell me what you think of my friend?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What friend, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir Robert Floyer; I ob&s;erved he never quitted you a moment while he &s;tayed at Mrs. Mears."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"His &s;tay, however, was too &s;hort,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"to allow me to form a fair opinion of him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But perhaps,"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"it was long enough to allow you to form a <HI>foul</HI> one."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia could not forbear laughing to hear the truth thus accidentally blundered out; but Mr. Harrel, looking very little plea&s;ed, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Surely you can find no fault with him? he is one of the mo&s;t fa|&s;hionable men I know."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My finding fault with him then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"will only farther prove what I
<PB N="83" REF="83">
believe is already pretty evident, that I am yet a novice in the art of admiration."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Arnott, animating at this &s;peech, glided behind her chair, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I knew you could not like him! I knew it from the turn of your mind;&mdash;I knew it even from your countenance!"</Q></P>
<P>Soon after, Sir Robert Floyer arrived.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are a pretty fellow, a'n't you,"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"to keep me waiting &s;o long?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I could not come a moment &s;ooner; I hardly expected to get here at all, for my hor&s;e has been &s;o confounded re&s;ty I could not tell how to get him along."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you come on hor&s;eback through the &s;treets, Sir Robert?"</Q> a&s;ked Mrs. Har|rel.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sometimes; when I am lazy. But what the d&mdash;l is the matter with him I don't know; he has &s;tarted at every thing. I &s;u&s;pect there has been &s;ome foul play with him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is he at the door, Sir?"</Q> cried Mor|rice.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> an&s;wered Sir Robert.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then I'll tell you what's the matter with him in a minute;"</Q> and away again ran Morrice.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What time did you get off la&s;t night Harrel?"</Q> &s;aid Sir Robert.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="84">
<Q REND="inline">"Not very early; but you were too much engaged to mi&s;s me. By the way,"</Q> lowering his voice, <Q REND="inline">"what do you think I lo&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I can't tell indeed, but I know what I gained: I have not had &s;uch a run of luck this winter."</Q></P>
<P>They then went up to a window to carry on their enquiries more privately.</P>
<P>At the words <HI>what do you think I lo&s;t,</HI> Cecilia, half &s;tarting, ca&s;t her eyes unea&s;ily upon Mrs. Harrel, but perceived not the lea&s;t change in her countenance. Mr. Ar|nott, however, &s;eemed as little plea&s;ed as her&s;elf, and from a &s;imilar &s;en&s;ation looked anxiou&s;ly at his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Morrice now returning, called out, <Q REND="inline">"He's had a fall, I a&s;&s;ure you!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Cur&s;e him!"</Q> cried Sir Robert, <Q REND="inline">"what &s;hall I do now? he co&s;t me the d&mdash;l and all of money, and I have not had him a twelvemonth. Can you lend me a hor&s;e for this morning, Harrel?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, I have not one that will do for you. You mu&s;t &s;end to A&s;tley."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who can I &s;end? John mu&s;t take care of this."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I'll go, Sir,"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"if you'll give me the commi&s;&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By no means, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Robert,
<PB N="85" REF="85">
<Q REND="inline">"I can't think of giving you &s;uch an office."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is the thing in the world I like be&s;t,"</Q> an&s;wered he; <Q REND="inline">"I under&s;tand hor&s;es, and had rather go to A&s;tley's than any where."</Q></P>
<P>The matter was now &s;ettled in a few minutes, and having received his directions, and an invitation to dinner, Morrice danced off, with an heart yet lighter than his heels.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Har|rel, <Q REND="inline">"this friend of yours is the mo&s;t obliging gentleman I ever met with; there was no avoiding a&s;king him to dinner."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Remember, however,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, who was involuntarily diverted at the &s;uc|ce&s;sful officiou&s;ne&s;s of her new acquaint|ance, <Q REND="inline">"that if you receive him henceforth as your gue&s;t, he obtains admi&s;&s;ion through his own merits, and not through my in|tere&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>At dinner, Morrice, who failed not to ac|cept the invitation of Mr. Harrel, was the gaye&s;t, and indeed the happie&s;t man in the company: the effort he had made to fa&s;ten him&s;elf upon Cecilia as an acquaintance, had not, it is true, from her&s;elf met with much encouragement; but he knew the chances were again&s;t him when he made the trial, and therefore the pro&s;pect of
<PB N="86" REF="86">
gaining admi&s;&s;ion into &s;uch a hou&s;e as Mr. Harrel's, was not only &s;ufficient to make amends for what &s;carcely amounted to a di&s;appointment, but a &s;ubject of &s;erious comfort from the credit of the connection, and of internal exultation at his own ma|nagement and addre&s;s.</P>
<P>In the evening, the ladies, as u&s;ual, went to a private a&s;&s;embly, and, as u&s;ual, were attended to it by Mr. Arnott. The other gentlemen had engagements el&s;ewhere.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. A PROJECT.</HEAD>
<P>SEVERAL days pa&s;&s;ed on nearly in the &s;ame manner; the mornings were all &s;pent in go&s;&s;ipping, &s;hopping and dre&s;&s;ing, and the evenings were regularly appropri|ated to public places, or large parties of company.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Mr. Arnott lived almo&s;t en|tirely in Portman-&s;quare; he &s;lept, indeed, at his own lodgings, but he boarded wholly with Mr. Harrel, who&s;e hou&s;e he never for a moment quitted till night, except to attend Cecilia and his &s;i&s;ter in their vi&s;it|ings and rambles.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnott was a young man of unex|ceptionable character, and of a di&s;po&s;ition mild, &s;erious and benignant: his principles and blamele&s;s conduct obtained the univer|&s;al e&s;teem of the world, but his manners, which were rather too preci&s;e, joined to an uncommon gravity of countenance and de|meanour, made his &s;ociety rather permitted as a duty, than &s;ought as a plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The charms of Cecilia had forcibly, &s;ud|denly
<PB N="88" REF="88">
and deeply penetrated his heart; he only lived in her pre&s;ence, away from her he hardly exi&s;ted: the emotions &s;he excited were rather tho&s;e of adoration than of love, for he gazed upon her beauty till he thought her more than human, and hung upon her accents till all &s;peech &s;eemed impertinent to him but her own. Yet &s;o &s;mall were his expectations of &s;ucce&s;s, that not even to his &s;i&s;ter did he hint at the &s;ituation of his heart: happy in an ea&s;y acce&s;s to her, he contented him&s;elf with &s;eeing, hearing and watching her, beyond which bounds he formed not any plan, and &s;carce indulged any hope.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Floyer, too, was a frequent vi&s;itor in Portman-&s;quare, where he dined almo&s;t daily. Cecilia was chagrined at &s;eeing &s;o much of him, and provoked to find her&s;elf almo&s;t con&s;tantly the object of his unre&s;trained examination; &s;he was, how|ever, far more &s;eriou&s;ly concerned for Mrs. Harrel, when &s;he di&s;covered that this fa|vourite friend of her hu&s;band was an un|principled &s;pendthrift, and an extravagant game&s;ter, for as he was the in&s;eparable com|panion of Mr. Harrel, &s;he dreaded the con&s;equence both of his influence and his example.</P>
<P>She &s;aw, too, with an amazement that daily increa&s;ed, the fatigue, yet fa&s;cination
<PB N="89" REF="89">
of a life of plea&s;ure: Mr. Harrel &s;eemed to con&s;ider his own hou&s;e merely as an H&ocirc;tel, where at any hour of the night he might di&s;turb the family to claim admit|tance, where letters and me&s;&s;ages might be left for him, where he dined when no other dinner was offered him, and where, when he made an appointment, he was to be met with. His lady, too, though more at home, was not therefore more &s;olitary; her acquaintance were numerous, expen&s;ive and idle, and every moment not actually &s;pent in company, was &s;crupulou&s;ly devoted to making arrangements for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time Cecilia, who every day had hoped that the next would afford her greater &s;atisfaction, but who every day found the pre&s;ent no better than the former, began to grow weary of eternally running the &s;ame round, and to &s;icken at the irk|&s;ome repetition of unremitting yet unin|tere&s;ting di&s;&s;ipation. She &s;aw nobody &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;ee, as &s;he had met with nobody for whom &s;he could care; for though &s;ome|times tho&s;e with whom &s;he mixed appeared to be amiable, &s;he knew that their manners, like their per&s;ons, were in their be&s;t array, and therefore &s;he had too much under&s;tand|ing to judge deci&s;ively of their characters. But what chiefly damped her hopes of forming a friend&s;hip with any of the new
<PB N="90" REF="90">
acquaintance to whom &s;he was introduced, was the ob&s;ervation &s;he her&s;elf made how ill the coldne&s;s of their hearts accorded with the warmth of their profe&s;&s;ions: upon every fir&s;t meeting, the civilities which were &s;hewn her, flattered her into believing &s;he had excited a partiality that a very little time would ripen into affection; the next meeting commonly confirmed the expecta|tion; but the third, and every future one, regularly de&s;troyed it. She found that time added nothing to their fondne&s;s, nor inti|macy to their &s;incerity; that the intere&s;t in her welfare which appeared to be taken at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;eldom, with whatever rea&s;on, encrea&s;ed, and often without any abated; that the di&s;tinction &s;he at fir&s;t met with, was no effu&s;ion of kindne&s;s, but of curio|&s;ity, which is &s;carcely &s;ooner gratified than &s;atiated; and that tho&s;e who lived always the life into which &s;he had only lately been initiated, were as much harra&s;&s;ed with it as her&s;elf, though le&s;s &s;pirited to relinqui&s;h, and more helple&s;s to better it, and that they coveted nothing but what was new, becau&s;e they had experienced the in&s;ufficiency of whatever was familiar.</P>
<P>She began now to regret the lo&s;s &s;he &s;u&s;|tained in quitting the neighbourhood, and being deprived of the conver&s;ation of Mr. Monckton, and yet more earne&s;tly to mi&s;s
<PB N="91" REF="91">
the affection and &s;igh for the &s;ociety of Mrs. Charlton, the lady with whom &s;he had long and happily re&s;ided at Bury; for &s;he was very &s;oon compelled to give up all expecta|tion of renewing the felicity of her earlier years, by being re&s;tored to the friend&s;hip of Mrs. Harrel, in whom &s;he had mi&s;taken the kindne&s;s of childi&s;h intimacy for the &s;incerity of cho&s;en affection; and though &s;he &s;aw her credulous error with mortifica|tion and di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;he regretted it with tenderne&s;s and &s;orrow. <Q REND="inline">"What, at la&s;t,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"is human felicity, who has ta&s;ted, and where is it to be found? If I, who, to others, &s;eem marked out for even a partial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it,&mdash;di&s;tingui&s;hed by fortune, care&s;&s;ed by the world, brought into the circle of high life, and &s;urrounded with &s;plendour, &s;eek without finding it, yet lo&s;|ing, &s;carce know how I mi&s;s it!"</Q></P>
<P>A&s;hamed upon reflection to believe &s;he was con&s;idered as an object of envy by others, while repining and di&s;contentd her|&s;elf, &s;he determined no longer to be the only one in&s;en&s;ible to the ble&s;&s;ings within her reach, but by projecting and adopting &s;ome plan of conduct, better &s;uited to her ta&s;te and feelings than the frivolous in&s;ipi|dity of her pre&s;ent life, to make at once a more &s;pirited and more worthy u&s;e of the
<PB N="92" REF="92">
affluence, freedom and power which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>A &s;cheme of happine&s;s at once rational and refined &s;oon pre&s;ented it&s;elf to her ima|gination. She purpo&s;ed, for the ba&s;is of her plan, to become mi&s;tre&s;s of her own time, and with this view, to drop all idle and unintere&s;ting acquaintance, who while they contribute neither to u&s;e nor plea&s;ure, make &s;o large a part of the community, that they may properly be called the under|miners of exi&s;tence: &s;he could then &s;hew &s;ome ta&s;te and di&s;cernment in her choice of friends, and &s;he re&s;olved to &s;elect &s;uch only as by their piety could elevate her mind, by their knowledge improve her under&s;tand|ing, or by their accompli&s;hments and man|ners delight her affections. This regula|tion, if &s;trictly adhered to, would &s;oon re|lieve her from the fatigue of receiving many vi&s;itors, and therefore &s;he might have all the lei&s;ure &s;he could de&s;ire for the pur|&s;uit of her favourite &s;tudies, mu&s;ic and reading.</P>
<P>Having thus, from her own e&s;timation of human perfection, culled whatever was noble&s;t for her &s;ociety, and from her own ideas of &s;edentary enjoyments, arranged the occupations of her hours of &s;olitude, &s;he felt fully &s;atisfied with the portion of happi|ne&s;s which her &s;cheme promi&s;ed to her&s;elf,
<PB N="93" REF="93">
and began next to con&s;ider what was due from her to the world.</P>
<P>And not without trembling did &s;he then look forward to the claims which the &s;plen|did income &s;he was &s;oon to po&s;&s;e&s;s would call upon her to di&s;charge. A &s;trong &s;en&s;e of DUTY, a fervent de&s;ire to ACT RIGHT, were the ruling characteri&s;tics of her mind: her affluence &s;he therefore con&s;idered as a debt contracted with the poor, and her in|dependence, as a tie upon her liberality to pay it with intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Many and various, then, &s;oothing to her &s;pirit and grateful to her &s;en&s;ibility, were the &s;cenes which her fancy delineated; now &s;he &s;upported an orphan, now &s;oftened the &s;orrows of a widow, now &s;natched from iniquity the feeble trembler at poverty, and now re&s;cued from &s;hame the proud &s;truggler with di&s;grace. The pro&s;pect at once ex|alted her hopes, and enraptured her ima|gination; &s;he regarded her&s;elf as an agent of Charity, and already in idea anticipated the rewards of a good and faithful delegate: &s;o animating are the de&s;igns of di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence! &s;o pure is the bli&s;s of intel|lectual philanthropy!</P>
<P>Not immediately, however, could this plan be put in execution; the &s;ociety &s;he meant to form could not be &s;elected in the hou&s;e of another, where, though to &s;ome
<PB N="94" REF="94">
&s;he might &s;hew a preference, there were none &s;he could reject: nor had &s;he yet the power to indulge, according to the munificence of her wi&s;hes, the exten&s;ive genero&s;ity &s;he pro|jected: the&s;e purpo&s;es demanded an hou&s;e of her own, and the unlimited di&s;po&s;al of her fortune, neither of which &s;he could claim till &s;he became of age. That period, however, was only eight months di&s;tant, and &s;he plea&s;ed her&s;elf with the intention of meliorating her plan in the mean time, and preparing to put it in practice.</P>
<P>But though, in common with all the race of &s;till-expecting man, &s;he looked for that happine&s;s in the time to come which the pre&s;ent failed to afford, &s;he had yet the &s;pirit and good &s;en&s;e to determine upon making every effort in her power, to render her immediate way of life more u&s;eful and contented.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t wi&s;h therefore, now, was to quit the hou&s;e of Mr. Harrel, where &s;he neither met with entertainment nor in&s;truc|tion, but was perpetually mortified by &s;ee|ing the total indifference of the friend in who&s;e &s;ociety &s;he had hoped for nothing but affection.</P>
<P>The will of her uncle, though it obliged her while under-age to live with one of her guardians, le&s;t her at liberty to chu&s;e and to change among&s;t them according to her
<PB N="95" REF="95">
wi&s;hes or convenience: &s;he determined, therefore, to make a vi&s;it her&s;elf to each of them, to ob&s;erve their manners and way of life, and then, to the be&s;t of her judgment, decide with which &s;he could be mo&s;t con|tented: re&s;olving, however, not to hint at her intention till it was ripe for execution, and then hone&s;tly to confe&s;s the rea&s;ons of her retreat.</P>
<P>She had acquainted them both of her journey to town the morning after her ar|rival. She was almo&s;t an entire &s;tranger to each of them, as &s;he had not &s;een Mr. Briggs &s;ince &s;he was nine years old, nor Mr. Delvile within the time &s;he could re|member.</P>
<P>The very morning that &s;he had &s;ettled her proceedings for the arrangement of this new plan, &s;he intended to reque&s;t the u&s;e of Mrs. Harrel's carriage, and to make, with|out delay, the vi&s;its preparatory to her re|moval: but when &s;he entered the parlour upon a &s;ummons to breakfa&s;t, her eager|ne&s;s to quit the hou&s;e gave way, for the pre&s;ent, to the plea&s;ure &s;he felt at the &s;ight of Mr. Monckton, who was ju&s;t arrived from Suffolk.</P>
<P>She expre&s;&s;ed her &s;atisfaction in the mo&s;t lively terms, and &s;crupled not to tell him &s;he had not once been &s;o much plea&s;ed &s;ince
<PB N="96" REF="96">
her journey to town, except at her fir&s;t meet|ing with Mrs. Harrel.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, who&s;e delight was infi|nitely &s;uperior to her own, and who&s;e joy in &s;eeing her was redoubled by the affec|tionate frankne&s;s of her reception, &s;tifled the emotions to which her &s;ight gave ri&s;e, and denying him&s;elf the &s;olace of expre&s;|&s;ing his feelings, &s;eemed much le&s;s charmed than her&s;elf at the meeting, and &s;uffered no word nor look to e&s;cape him beyond what could be authori&s;ed by friendly civility.</P>
<P>He then renewed with Mrs. Harrel an acquaintance which had been formed be|fore her marriage, but which &s;he had dropt when her di&s;tance from Cecilia, upon who&s;e account alone he had thought it worth cul|tivation, made it no longer of u&s;e to him. She afterwards introduced her brother to him; and a conver&s;ation very intere&s;ting to both the ladies took place, concerning &s;e|veral families with which they had been formerly connected, as well as the neigh|bourhood at large in which they had lately dwelt.</P>
<P>Very little was the &s;hare taken by Mr. Arnott in the&s;e accounts and enquiries; the unaffected joy with which Cecilia had re|ceived Mr. Monckton, had &s;truck him with a &s;en&s;ation of envy as involuntary as it was painful: he did not, indeed, &s;u&s;pect
<PB N="97" REF="97">
that gentleman's &s;ecret views; no rea&s;on for &s;u&s;picion was obvious, and his penetra|tion &s;unk not deeper than appearances; he knew, too, that he was married, and there|fore no jealou&s;y occurred to him; but &s;till &s;he had &s;miled upon him!&mdash;and he felt that to purcha&s;e for him&s;elf a &s;mile of &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s, he would have &s;acrificed almo&s;t all el&s;e that was valuable to him up|on earth.</P>
<P>With an attention infinitely more accu|rate, Mr. Monckton had returned his ob|&s;ervations. The unea&s;ine&s;s of his mind was apparent, and the anxious watchfulne&s;s of his eyes plainly manife&s;ted whence it aro&s;e. From a &s;ituation, indeed, which permitted an intercour&s;e the mo&s;t con&s;tant and unre&s;trained with &s;uch an object as Ce|cilia, nothing le&s;s could be expected, and therefore he con&s;idered his admiration as inevitable; all that remained to be di&s;|covered, was the reception it had met from his fair en&s;laver. Nor was he here long in doubt; he &s;oon &s;aw that &s;he was not merely free from all pa&s;&s;ion her&s;elf, but had &s;o little watched Mr. Arnott as to be uncon&s;cious &s;he had in&s;pired any.</P>
<P>Yet was his own &s;erenity, though appa|rently unmoved, little le&s;s di&s;turbed in &s;e|cret than that of his rival; he did not think him a formidable candidate, but he dreaded
<PB N="98" REF="98">
the effects of intimacy, fearing &s;he might fir&s;t grow accu&s;tomed to his attentions, and then become plea&s;ed with them: he appre|hended, al&s;o, the influence of his &s;i&s;ter, and of Mr. Harrel in his favour; and though he had no difficulty to per&s;uade him&s;elf that any offer he might now make would be rejected without he&s;itation, he knew too well the in&s;idious properties of per&s;everance, to &s;ee him, without inquie|tude, &s;ituated &s;o advantageou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The morning was far advanced be|fore he took leave, yet he found no oppor|tunity of di&s;cour&s;ing with Cecilia, though he impatiently de&s;ired to examine into the &s;tate of her mind, and to di&s;cover whether her London journey had added any fre&s;h difficulties to the &s;ucce&s;s of his long con|certed &s;cheme. But as Mrs. Harrel in|vited him to dinner, he hoped the after|noon would be more propitious to his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Cecilia, too, was eager to communicate to him her favourite project, and to receive his advice with re&s;pect to it's execution. She had long been u&s;ed to his coun&s;el, and &s;he was now more than ever &s;olicitous to ob|tain it, becau&s;e &s;he con&s;idered him as the only per&s;on in London who was intere&s;ted in her welfare.</P>
<P>He &s;aw, however, no promi&s;e of better
<PB N="99" REF="99">
&s;ucce&s;s when he made his appearance at dinner time, for not only Mr. Arnott was already arrived, but Sir Robert Floyer, and he found Cecilia &s;o much the object of their mutual attention, that he had &s;till le&s;s chance than in the morning of &s;peaking to her unheard.</P>
<P>Yet was he not idle; the &s;ight of Sir Ro|bert gave abundant employment to his pe|netration, which was immediately at work, to di&s;cover the motive of his vi&s;it: but this, with all his &s;agacity, was not ea&s;ily decided; for though the con&s;tant direction of his eyes towards Cecilia, proved, at lea&s;t, that he was not in&s;en&s;ible of her beauty, his carele&s;&s;ne&s;s whether or not &s;he was hurt by his examination, the little pains he took to conver&s;e with her, and the invariable a&s;&s;urance and negligence of his manners, &s;eemed &s;trongly to demon&s;trate an indifference to the &s;entiments he in|&s;pired, totally incompatible with the &s;oli|citude of affection.</P>
<P>In Cecilia he had nothing to ob&s;erve but what his knowledge of her character pre|pared him to expect, a &s;hame no le&s;s indig|nant than mode&s;t at the freedom with which &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf &s;urveyed.</P>
<P>Very little, therefore, was the &s;atisfac|tion which this vi&s;it procured him, &s;or &s;oon after dinner the ladies retired; and as they
<PB N="100" REF="100">
had an early engagement for the evening, the gentlemen received no &s;ummons to their tea-table. But he contrived, before they quitted the room, to make an appointment for attending them the next morning to a rehear&s;al of a new &s;erious Opera.</P>
<P>He &s;tayed not after their departure longer than decency required, for too much in earne&s;t was his pre&s;ent pur&s;uit, to fit him for &s;uch conver&s;ation as the hou&s;e in Ce|cilia's ab&s;ence could afford him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. AN OPERA REHEARSAL.</HEAD>
<P>THE next day, between eleven and twelve o'clock, Mr. Monckton was again in Portman-&s;quare; he found, as he expected, both the ladies, and he found, as he feared, Mr. Arnott prepared to be of their party. He had, however, but little time to repine at this intru&s;ion, before he was di&s;turbed by another, for, in a few mi|nutes, they were joined by Sir Robert Floyer, who al&s;o declared his intention of accompanying them to the Haymarket.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, to di&s;gui&s;e his chagrin, pretended he was in great ha&s;te to &s;et off, le&s;t they &s;hould be too late for the over|ture: they were, therefore, quitting the breakfa&s;t room, when they were &s;topt by the appearance of Mr. Morrice.</P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;e which the &s;ight of him gave to Mr. Monckton was extreme; he knew that he was unacquainted with Mr. Harrel, for he remembered they were &s;trangers to each other when they lately met at his hou&s;e; he concluded, therefore, that Ce|cilia
<PB N="102" REF="102">
was the object of his vi&s;it, but he could frame no conjecture under what pre|tence.</P>
<P>The ea&s;y terms upon which he &s;eemed with all the family by no means dimini&s;hed his amazement; for when Mrs. Harrel ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ome concern that &s;he was obliged to go out, he galiy begged her not to mind him, a&s;&s;uring her he could not have &s;tayed two minutes, and promi&s;ing, un|a&s;ked, to call again the next day: and when &s;he added, <Q REND="inline">"We would not hurry away &s;o, only we are going to a rehear&s;al of an Opera,"</Q> he exclaimed with quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"A rehear&s;al!&mdash;are you really? I have a great mind to go too!"</Q></P>
<P>Then, perceiving Mr. Monckton, he bowed to him with great re&s;pect, and en|quired, with no little &s;olemnity, how he had left lady Margaret, hoped &s;he was perfectly recovered from her late indi&s;po&s;i|tion, and a&s;ked &s;undry que&s;tions with re|gard to her plan for the winter.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e was ill con&s;tructed for rendering his pre&s;ence de&s;irable to Mr. Monckton; he an&s;wered him very drily, and again pre&s;&s;ed their departure.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"there's no occa|&s;ion for &s;uch ha&s;te; the rehear&s;al does not begin till one."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="103">
<Q REND="inline">"You are mi&s;taken, Sir!"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton; <Q REND="inline">"it is to begin at twelve o'clock."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O ay, very true,"</Q> returned Morrice; <Q REND="inline">"I had forgot the dances, and I &s;uppo&s;e they are to be rehear&s;ed fir&s;t. Pray, Mi&s;s Beverley, did you ever &s;ee any dances re|hear&s;ed?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You'll be exce&s;&s;ively entertained, then, I a&s;&s;ure you. It's the mo&s;t comical thing in the world to &s;ee tho&s;e &s;ignores and &s;ignoras cutting capers in a morning. And the <HI>figu|ranti</HI> will divert you beyond mea&s;ure; you never &s;aw &s;uch a &s;habby &s;et in your life: but the mo&s;t amu&s;ing thing is to look in their faces, for all the time they are jump|ing and &s;kipping about the &s;tage as if they could not &s;tand &s;till for joy, they look as &s;edate and as di&s;mal as if they were &s;o many undertakers men."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not a word again&s;t dancing!"</Q> cried Sir Robert, <Q REND="inline">"it's the only thing carries one to the Opera; and I am &s;ure it's the only thing one minds at it."</Q></P>
<P>The two ladies were then handed to Mrs. Harrel's <HI>vis-&agrave;-vis;</HI> and the gentle|men, joined without further ceremony by Mr. Morrice, followed them to the Hay|market.</P>
<P>The rehear&s;al was not begun, and Mrs. Harrel and Cecilia &s;ecured them&s;elves a
<PB N="104" REF="104">
box upon the &s;tage, from which the gen|tlemen of their party took care not to be very di&s;tant.</P>
<P>They were &s;oon perceived by Mr. Go&s;|port, who in&s;tantly entered into conver&s;ation with Cecilia. Mi&s;s Larolles, who with &s;ome other ladies came &s;oon after into the next box, looked out to court&s;ie and nod, with her u&s;ual readine&s;s, at Mrs. Harrel, but took not any notice of Cecilia, though &s;he made the fir&s;t advances.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What's the matter now?"</Q> cried Mr. Go&s;port; <Q REND="inline">"have you affronted your little prattling friend?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not with my own knowledge;"</Q> an|&s;wered Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"perhaps &s;he does not re|collect me."</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t then Mi&s;s Larolles, tapping at the door, came in from the next box to &s;peak to Mrs. Harrel; with whom &s;he &s;tood chatting and laughing &s;ome minutes, with|out &s;eeming to perceive that Cecilia was of her party.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why what have you done to the poor girl?"</Q> whi&s;pered Mr. Go&s;port; <Q REND="inline">"did you talk more than her&s;elf when you &s;aw her la&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Would that have been po&s;&s;ible?"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"however, I &s;till fancy &s;he does not know me."</Q></P>
<P>She then &s;tood up, which making Mi&s;s
<PB N="105" REF="105">
Larolles involuntarily turn towards her, &s;he again court&s;ied; a civility which that young lady &s;carce deigned to return, before, bridling with an air of re&s;entment, &s;he ha&s;tily looked another way, and then, nodding good-hu|mouredly at Mrs. Harrel, hurried back to her party.</P>
<P>Cecilia, much amazed, &s;aid to Mr. Go&s;|port, <Q REND="inline">"See now how great was our pre|&s;umption in &s;uppo&s;ing this young lady's lo|quacity always at our devotion!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah madam!"</Q> cried he, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"there is no permanency, no con&s;i&s;tency in the world! no, not even in the tongue of a VOLUBLE! and if that fails, upon what may we depend?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But &s;eriou&s;ly,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry I have offended her, and the more be|cau&s;e I &s;o little know how, that I can offer her no apology."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you appoint me your envoy? Shall I demand the cau&s;e of the&s;e ho&s;tili|ties?"</Q></P>
<P>She thanked him, and he followed Mi&s;s Larolles; who was now addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf with great earne&s;tne&s;s to Mr. Meadows, the gentleman with whom &s;he was conver&s;ing when Cecilia fir&s;t &s;aw her in Portman|&s;quare. He &s;topt a moment to let her fini&s;h her &s;peech, which, with no little &s;pirit,
<PB N="106" REF="106">
&s;he did in the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">"I never knew any thing like it in my life; but I &s;ha'n't put up with &s;uch airs, I a&s;&s;ure her!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Meadows made not any other return to her harangue, but &s;tretching him&s;elf with a languid &s;mile and yawning: Mr. Go&s;port, therefore, &s;eizing the moment of ce&s;&s;ation, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Larolles, I hear a &s;trange re|port about you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you?"</Q> returned &s;he, with quick|ne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"pray what is it? &s;omething mon|&s;trous impertinent, I dare &s;ay,&mdash;however, I a&s;&s;ure you it i'n't true."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your a&s;&s;urance,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"carries conviction indi&s;putable, for the report was that you had left off talking."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, was that all!"</Q> cried &s;he, di&s;ap|pointed, <Q REND="inline">"I thought it had been &s;ome|thing about Mr. Sawyer, for I declare I have been plagued &s;o about him, I am quite &s;ick of his name."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And for my part, I never heard it! &s;o fear nothing from me upon his account."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Mr. Go&s;port, how can you &s;ay &s;o? I am &s;ure you mu&s;t know about the fe&s;tino that night, for it was all over the town in a moment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What fe&s;tino?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, only conceive how provoking!&mdash;why, I know nothing el&s;e was talked of for a month!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="107">
<Q REND="inline">"You are mo&s;t formidably &s;tout this morning! it is not two minutes &s;ince I &s;aw you fling the gauntlet at Mi&s;s Beverley, and yet you are already prepared for another antagoni&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O as to Mi&s;s Beverley, I mu&s;t really beg you not to mention her; &s;he has be|haved &s;o impertinently, that I don't intend ever to &s;peak to her again."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, what has &s;he done?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O &s;he's been &s;o rude you've no notion. I'll tell you how it was. You mu&s;t know I met her at Mrs. Harrel's the day &s;he came to town, and the very next morning I waited on her my&s;elf, for I would not &s;end a ticket, becau&s;e I really wi&s;hed to be civil to her; well, the day after, &s;he never came near me, though I called upon her again; however, I did not take any notice of that; but when the third day came, and I found &s;he had not even &s;ent me a ticket, I thought it mon&s;trous ill bred indeed; and now there has pa&s;t more than a week, and yet &s;he has never called: &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he don't like me; &s;o I &s;hall drop her acquaintance."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Go&s;port, &s;atisfied now with the &s;ubject of her complaint, returned to Cecilia, and informed her of the heavy charge which was brought again&s;t her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am glad, at lea&s;t, to know my crime,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"for otherwi&s;e I &s;hould
<PB N="108" REF="108">
certainly have &s;inned on in ignorance, as I mu&s;t confe&s;s I never thought of returning her vi&s;its: but even if I had, I &s;hould not have &s;uppo&s;ed I had yet lo&s;t much time."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I beg your pardon there,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Harrel; <Q REND="inline">"a fir&s;t vi&s;it ought to be returned always by the third day."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then have I an unan&s;werable excu&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"for I remember that on the third day I &s;aw her at your hou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O that's nothing at all to the purpo&s;e; you &s;hould have waited upon her, or &s;ent her a ticket, ju&s;t the &s;ame as if you had not &s;een her."</Q></P>
<P>The overture was now begun, and Ce|cilia declined any further conver&s;ation. This was the fir&s;t Opera &s;he had ever heard, yet &s;he was not wholly a &s;tranger to Italian compo&s;itions, having a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly &s;tudied mu&s;ic from a natural love of the art, at|tended all the be&s;t concerts her neighbour|hood afforded, and regularly received from London the works of the be&s;t ma&s;ters. But the little &s;kill &s;he had thus gained, &s;erved rather to increa&s;e than to le&s;&s;en the &s;urpri&s;e with which &s;he heard the pre&s;ent performance,&mdash;a &s;urprize of which the di&s;|covery of her own ignorance made not the lea&s;t part. Uncon&s;cious from the little &s;he had acquired how much was to be learnt, &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed to find the inadequate
<PB N="109" REF="109">
power of written mu&s;ic to convey any idea of vocal abilities: with ju&s;t knowledge enough, therefore, to under&s;tand &s;omething of the difficulties, and feel much of the merit, &s;he gave to the whole Opera an avidity of attention almo&s;t painful from its own eagerne&s;s.</P>
<P>But both the &s;urprize and the plea&s;ure which &s;he received from the performance in general, were faint, cold, and languid, compared to the &s;trength of tho&s;e emo|tions when excited by Signore Pacchierotti in particular; and though not half the ex|cellencies of that &s;uperior &s;inger were ne|ce&s;&s;ary either to amaze or charm her unaccu&s;|tomed ears, though the refinement of his ta&s;te and ma&s;terly originality of his genius, to be prai&s;ed as they de&s;erved, called for the judgment and knowledge of profe&s;&s;ors, yet a natural love of mu&s;ic in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;upplied the place of cultivation, and what &s;he could neither explain nor under&s;tand, &s;he could feel and enjoy.</P>
<P>The opera was Arta&s;er&s;e; and the plea|&s;ure &s;he received from the mu&s;ic was much augmented by her previous acquaintance with that intere&s;ting drama; yet, as to all noviciates in &s;cience, whatever is lea&s;t com|plicated is mo&s;t plea&s;ing, &s;he found her&s;elf by nothing &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed, as by the plaintive and beautiful &s;implicity with
<PB N="110" REF="110">
which Pacchierotti uttered the affecting re|petition of <HI>&s;ono innocente!</HI> his voice, always either &s;weet or impa&s;&s;ioned, delivered tho&s;e words in a tone of &s;oftne&s;s, pathos, and &s;en&s;ibility, that &s;truck her with a &s;en&s;ation not more new than delightful.</P>
<P>But though &s;he was, perhaps, the only per&s;on thus a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;he was by no means the only one enraptured; for notwith&s;tand|ing &s;he was too earne&s;tly engaged to remark the company in general, &s;he could not avoid taking notice of an old gentleman who &s;tood by one of the &s;ide &s;cenes, again&s;t which he lent his head in a manner that concealed his face, with an evident de&s;ign to be wholly ab&s;orbed in li&s;tening: and dur|ing the &s;ongs of Pacchierotti he &s;ighed &s;o deeply that Cecilia, &s;truck by his uncom|mon &s;en&s;ibility to the power of mu&s;ic, in|voluntarily watched him, whenever her mind was &s;ufficiently at liberty to attend to any emotions but its own.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the rehear&s;al was over, the gentlemen of Mrs. Harrel's party crowded before her box; and Cecilia then perceived that the per&s;on who&s;e mu&s;ical enthu&s;ia&s;m had excited her curio&s;ity, was the &s;ame old gentleman who&s;e extraordinary behaviour had &s;o much &s;urprized her at the hou&s;e of Mr. Monckton. Her de&s;ire to obtain &s;ome information concerning him again reviving,
<PB N="111" REF="111">
&s;he was beginning to make fre&s;h enquiries, when &s;he was interrupted by the approach of Captain Are&s;by.</P>
<P>That gentleman, advancing to her with a &s;mile of the extreme&s;t &s;elf-complacency, after hoping, in a low voice, he had the honour of &s;eeing her well, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"How wretchedly empty is the town! pe|trifying to a degree! I believe you do not find your&s;elf at pre&s;ent <HI>ob&s;ed&eacute;</HI> by too much company?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>At pre&s;ent,</HI> I believe the contrary!"</Q> cried Mr. Go&s;port.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Really!"</Q> &s;aid the captain, un&s;u&s;pi|cious of his &s;neer, <Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t I have hardly &s;een a &s;oul. Have you tried the Pantheon yet, ma'am?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nor I; I don't know whether people go there this year. It is not a favourite <HI>&s;pectacle</HI> with me; that &s;itting to hear the mu&s;ic is a horrid bore. Have you done the Fe&s;tino the honour to look in there yet?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Permit me, then, to have the honour to beg you will try it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, ay, true,"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel; <Q REND="inline">"I have really u&s;ed you very ill about that; I &s;hould have got you in for a &s;ub&s;criber: but Lord, I have done nothing for you yet,
<PB N="112" REF="112">
and you never put me in mind. There's the ancient mu&s;ic, and Abel's concert;&mdash;as to the opera, we may have a box between us;&mdash;but there's the ladies concert we mu&s;t try for; and there's&mdash;O Lord, fifty other places we mu&s;t think of!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh times of folly and di&s;&s;ipation!"</Q> exclaimed a voice at &s;ome di&s;tance; <Q REND="inline">"Oh mignons of idlene&s;s and luxury! What next will ye invent for the perdition of your time! How yet further will ye pro|ceed in the annihilation of virtue!"</Q></P>
<P>Every body &s;tared; but Mrs. Harrel cooly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Dear, it's only the man|hater!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The man-hater?"</Q> repeated Cecilia, who found that the &s;peech was made by the object of her former curio&s;ity; <Q REND="inline">"is that the name by which he is known?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is known by fifty names,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton; <Q REND="inline">"his friends call him the <HI>mo|rali&s;t;</HI> the young ladies, the <HI>crazy-man;</HI> the macaronies, the <HI>bore;</HI> in &s;hort, he is called by any and every name but his own."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is a mo&s;t petrifying wretch, I a&s;&s;ure you,"</Q> &s;aid the captain; <Q REND="inline">"I am <HI>ob&s;ed&eacute;</HI> by him <HI>partout;</HI> if I had known he had been &s;o near, I &s;hould certainly have &s;aid no|thing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That you have done &s;o well,"</Q> cried
<PB N="113" REF="113">
Mr. Go&s;port, <Q REND="inline">"that if you had known it the whole time, you could have done it no better."</Q></P>
<P>The captain, who had not heard this &s;peech, which was rather made at him than to him, continued his addre&s;s to Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"Give me leave to have the honour of hop|ing you intend to honour our &s;elect ma&s;que|rade at the Pantheon with your pre&s;ence. We &s;hall have but 500 tickets, and the &s;ub|&s;cription will only be three guineas and a half."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh objects of penury and want!"</Q> again exclaimed the incognito; <Q REND="inline">"Oh va&s;|&s;als of famine and di&s;tre&s;s! Come and li&s;ten to this wantonne&s;s of wealth! Come, naked and breadle&s;s as ye are, and learn how that money is con&s;umed which to you might bring raiment and food!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That &s;trange wretch,"</Q> &s;aid the captain, <Q REND="inline">"ought really to be confined; I have had the honour to be <HI>degout&eacute;</HI> by him &s;o often, that I think him quite obnoxious. I make it quite a principle to &s;eal up my lips the moment I perceive him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Where is it, then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that you have &s;o often met him?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> an&s;wered the captain, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>partout;</HI> there is no greater bore about town. But the time I found him mo&s;t petrifying was once when I happened to have the honour
<PB N="114" REF="114">
of dancing with a very young lady, who was but ju&s;t come from a boarding-&s;chool, and who&s;e friends had done me the honour to fix upon me upon the principle of fir&s;t bringing her out: and while I was doing <HI>mon po&s;&s;ible</HI> for killing the time, he came up, and in his particular manner, told her I had no meaning in any thing I &s;aid! I mu&s;t own I never &s;elt more tempted to be <HI>enrag&eacute;</HI> with a per&s;on in years, in my life."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Arnott now brought the ladies word that their carriage was ready, and they quitted their box: but as Cecilia had never before &s;een the interior parts of a theatre, Mr. Monckton, hoping while they loitered to have an opportunity of talking with her, a&s;ked Morrice why he did not <HI>&s;hew the lyons?</HI> Morrice, always happy in being employed, declared it was <HI>ju&s;t the thing he liked be&s;t,</HI> and begged permi&s;&s;ion to do the honours to Mrs. Harrel, who, ever eager in the &s;earch of amu&s;ement, willingly accepted his offer.</P>
<P>They all, therefore, marched upon the &s;tage, their own party now being the only one that remained.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We &s;hall make a triumphal entry here,"</Q> cried Sir Robert Floyer; <Q REND="inline">"the very tread of the &s;tage half tempts me to turn actor."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="115">
<Q REND="inline">"You are a rare man,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;|port, <Q REND="inline">"if, at your time of life, that is a turn not already taken."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My time of life!"</Q> repeated he; <Q REND="inline">"what do you mean by that? do you take me for an old man!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, but I take you to be pa&s;t childhood, and con&s;equently to have &s;erved your apprentice&s;hip to the actors you have mixed with on the great &s;tage of the world, and, for &s;ome years at lea&s;t, to have &s;et up for your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come,"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"let's have a little &s;pouting; 'twill make us warm."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Robert, <Q REND="inline">"if we &s;pout to an animating object. If Mi&s;s Beverley will be Juliet, I am Romeo at her &s;er|vice."</Q></P>
<P>At this moment the incognito, quitting the corner in which he had planted him&s;elf, came &s;uddenly forward, and &s;tanding before the whole group, ca&s;t upon Cecilia a look of much compa&s;&s;ion, and called out, <Q REND="inline">"Poor &s;imple victim! ha&s;t thou already &s;o many pur&s;uers? yet &s;ee&s;t not that thou art marked for &s;acrifice! yet knowe&s;t not that thou art de&s;tined for prey!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, extremely &s;truck by this extra|ordinary addre&s;s, &s;topt &s;hort and looked much di&s;turbed: which, when he perceived, he added, <Q REND="inline">"Let the danger, not the
<PB N="116" REF="116">
warning affect you! di&s;card the &s;ycophants that &s;urround you, &s;eek the virtuous, re|lieve the poor, and &s;ave your&s;elf from the impending de&s;truction of unfeeling pro&s;|perity!"</Q></P>
<P>Having uttered the&s;e words with vehe|mence and authority, he &s;ternly pa&s;&s;ed them, and di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>Cecilia, too much a&s;toni&s;hed for &s;peech, &s;tood for &s;ome time immoveable, revolving in her mind various conjectures upon the meaning of an exhortation &s;o &s;trange and &s;o urgent.</P>
<P>Nor was the re&s;t of the company much le&s;s di&s;compo&s;ed: Sir Robert, Mr. Monck|ton and Mr. Arnott, each con&s;cious of their own particular plans, were each ap|prehen&s;ive that the warning pointed at him&s;elf: Mr. Go&s;port was offended at be|ing included in the general appellation of &s;ycophants; Mrs. Harrel was provoked at being interrupted in her ramble; and Cap|tain Are&s;by, &s;ickening at the very &s;ight of him, retreated the moment he came forth.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For heaven's &s;ake,"</Q> cried Cecilia, when &s;omewhat recovered from her con&s;ternation, <Q REND="inline">"who can this be, and what can he mean? You, Mr. Monckton, mu&s;t &s;urely know &s;omething of him; it was at your hou&s;e I fir&s;t &s;aw him."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="117">
<Q REND="inline">"Indeed,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Monckton, <Q REND="inline">"I knew almo&s;t nothing of him then, and I am but little better informed now. Belfield picked him up &s;omewhere, and de&s;ired to bring him to my hou&s;e: he called him by the name of Albany: I found him a mo&s;t extraordinary character, and Belfield, who is a wor&s;hipper of originality, was very fond of him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He's a devili&s;h crabbed old fellow,"</Q> cried Sir Robert, <Q REND="inline">"and if he goes on much longer at this confounded rate, he &s;tands a very fair chance of getting his ears cropt."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is a man of the mo&s;t &s;ingular con|duct I have ever met with,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Go&s;|port; <Q REND="inline">"he &s;eems to hold mankind in ab|horrence, yet he is never a moment alone, and at the &s;ame time that he intrudes him|&s;elf into all parties, he a&s;&s;ociates with none: he is commonly a &s;tern and &s;ilent ob&s;erver of all that pa&s;&s;es, or when he &s;peaks, it is but to utter &s;ome &s;entence of rigid morality, or &s;ome bitterne&s;s of indignant reproof."</Q></P>
<P>The carriage was now again announced, and Mr. Monckton taking Cecilia's hand, while Mr. Morrice &s;ecured to him&s;elf the honour of Mrs. Harrel's, Sir Robert and Mr. Go&s;port made their bows and departed. But though they had now quitted the &s;tage, and arrived at the head of a &s;mall &s;tair ca&s;e
<PB N="118" REF="118">
by which they were to de&s;cend out of the theatre, Mr. Monckton, finding all his tor|mentors retired, except Mr. Arnott, whom he hoped to elude, could not re&s;i&s;t making one more attempt for a few moments con|ver&s;ation with Cecilia; and therefore, again applying to Morrice, he called out, <Q REND="inline">"I don't think you have &s;hewn the ladies any of the contrivances behind the &s;cenes?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">True,"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"no more I have; &s;uppo&s;e we go back?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall like it va&s;tly,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Har|rel; and back they returned.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton now &s;oon found an op|portunity to &s;ay to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Bever|ley, what I fore&s;aw has exactly come to pa&s;s; you are &s;urrounded by &s;elfi&s;h de|&s;igners, by intere&s;ted, double-minded peo|ple, who have nothing at heart but your fortune, and who&s;e mercenary views, if you are not guarded again&s;t them&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>Here a loud &s;cream from Mrs. Harrel interrupted his &s;peech; Cecilia, much alarmed, turned from him to enquire the cau&s;e, and Mr. Monckton was obliged to follow her example: but his mortification was almo&s;t intolerable when he &s;aw that lady in a violent fit of laughter, and found her &s;cream was only occa&s;ioned by &s;eeing Mr. Morrice, in his diligence to do the
<PB N="119" REF="119">
honours, pull upon his own head one of the &s;ide &s;cenes!</P>
<P>There was now no po&s;&s;ibility of propo&s;ing any farther delay; but Mr. Monckton, in attending the ladies to their carriage, was obliged to have recour&s;e to his utmo&s;t di&s;|cretion and forbearance, in order to check his de&s;ire of reprimanding Morrice for his blundering officiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Dre&s;&s;ing, dining with company at home, and then going out with company abroad, filled up, as u&s;ual, the re&s;t of the day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. A SUPPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning Cecilia, at the re|peated remon&s;trances of Mrs. Harrel, con&s;ented to call upon Mi&s;s Larolles. She felt the impracticability of beginning at pre&s;ent the alteration in her way of life &s;he had projected, and therefore thought it mo&s;t expedient to a&s;&s;ume no &s;ingularity till her independency &s;hould enable her to &s;up|port it with con&s;i&s;tency; yet greater than ever was her internal eagerne&s;s to better &s;atisfy her inclination and her con&s;cience in the di&s;po&s;ition of her time, and the di&s;tri|bution of her wealth, &s;ince &s;he had heard the emphatic charge of her unknown Men|tor.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel declined accompanying her in this vi&s;it, becau&s;e &s;he had appointed a &s;urveyor to bring a plan for the in&s;pection of Mr. Harrel and her&s;elf, of a &s;mall tem|porary building, to be erected at Violet|Bank, for the purpo&s;e of performing plays in private the en&s;uing Ea&s;ter.</P>
<P>When the &s;treet door was opened for her to get into the carriage, &s;he was &s;truck with
<PB N="121" REF="121">
the appearance of an elderly woman who was &s;tanding at &s;ome di&s;tance, and &s;eemed &s;hivering with cold, and who, as &s;he de|&s;cended the &s;teps, joined her hands in an act of &s;upplication, and advanced nearer to the carriage.</P>
<P>Cecilia &s;topt to look at her: her dre&s;s, though par&s;imonious, was too neat for a beggar, and &s;he con&s;idered a moment what &s;he could offer her. The poor woman con|tinued to move forward, but with a &s;low|ne&s;s of pace that indicated extreme weakne&s;s; and, as &s;he approached and rai&s;ed her head, &s;he exhibited a countenance &s;o wretched, and a complection &s;o &s;ickly, that Cecilia was impre&s;&s;ed with horror at the &s;ight.</P>
<P>With her hands &s;till joined, and a voice that &s;eemed fearful of its own &s;ound, <Q REND="inline">"Oh madam,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"that you would but hear me!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hear you!"</Q> repeated Cecilia, ha&s;tily feeling for her pur&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"mo&s;t certainly; and tell me how I &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heaven ble&s;s you for &s;peaking &s;o kindly, madam!"</Q> cried the woman, with a voice more a&s;&s;ured; <Q REND="inline">"I was &s;adly afraid you would be angry, but I &s;aw the carriage at the door, and I thought I would try; for I could be no wor&s;e; and di&s;tre&s;s, madam, makes very bold."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Have you, then, lo&s;t a &s;on?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, madam; but he was a great deal too good to live, &s;o I have quite left off grieving for him now."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come in, good woman,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"it is too cold to &s;tand here, and you &s;eem half &s;tarved already: come in, and let me have &s;ome talk with you."</Q></P>
<P>She then gave orders that the carriage &s;hould be driven round the &s;quare till &s;he was ready, and making the woman follow her into a parlour, de&s;ired to know what &s;he &s;hould do for her; changing, while &s;he &s;poke, from a movement of encrea&s;ing compa&s;&s;ion, the crown which &s;he held in her hand for double that &s;um.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You can do every thing, madam,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"if you will but plead for us to his honour: he little thinks of our di&s;tre&s;s, becau&s;e he has been afflicted with none him&s;elf, and I would not be &s;o trouble&s;ome to him, but indeed, indeed, madam, we are quite pinched for want!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, &s;truck with the words <HI>he little</HI>

<P><Q REND="inline">"I humbly thank you, madam,"</Q> &s;aid the woman, curtfying low, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hall I give you a receipt?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A receipt?"</Q> cried Cecilia, with emo|tion, <Q REND="inline">"for what? Alas, our accounts are by no means balanced! but I &s;hall do more for you if I find you as de&s;erving an object as you &s;eem to be."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are very good, madam; but I only meant a receipt in part of payment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Payment for what? I don't under&s;tand you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did his honour never tell you, madam, of our account?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What account?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Our bill, madam, for work done to the new Temple at Violet-Bank: it was the la&s;t great work my poor hu&s;band was able to do, for it was there he met with his misfor|tune."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What bill? What misfortune?"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"What had your hu&s;band to do at Violet-Bank?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He was the carpenter, madam. I
<PB N="124" REF="124">
thought you might have &s;een poor Hill the carpenter there."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, I never was there my&s;elf. Per|haps you mi&s;take me for Mrs. Harrel."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why &s;ure, madam, a'n't you his ho|nour's lady?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No. But tell me, what is this bill?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"'Tis a bill, madam, for very hard work, for work, madam, which I am &s;ure will co&s;t my hu&s;band his life; and though I have been after his honour night and day to get it, and &s;ent him letters and petitions with an account of our misfortunes, I have never received &s;o much as a &s;hilling! and now the &s;ervants won't even let me wait in the hall to &s;peak to him. Oh madam! you who &s;eem &s;o good, plead to his honour in our behalf! tell him my poor hu&s;band can|not live! tell him my children are &s;tarving! and tell him my poor Billy, that u&s;ed to help to keep us, is dead, and that all the work I can do by my&s;elf is not enough to maintain us!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good heaven!"</Q> cried Cecilia, ex|tremely moved, <Q REND="inline">"is it then your own money for which you &s;ue thus humbly?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, madam, for my own ju&s;t and hone&s;t money, as his honour knows, and will tell you him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Impo&s;&s;ible!"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"he can|not know it; but I will take care he &s;hall
<PB N="125" REF="125">
&s;oon be informed of it. How much is the bill?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Two-and-twenty pounds, madam."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, no more?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah madam, you gentlefolks little think how much that is to poor people! A hard working family, like mine, madam, with the help of 20<HI>l.</HI> will go on for a long while quite in paradi&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Poor worthy woman!"</Q> cried Cecilia, who&s;e eyes were filled with tears of com|pa&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"if 20<HI>l.</HI> will place you in para|di&s;e, and that 20<HI>l.</HI> only your ju&s;t right, it is hard, indeed, that you &s;hould be kept without it; e&s;pecially when your debtors are too affluent to mi&s;s it. Stay here a few moments, and I will bring you the money immediately."</Q></P>
<P>Away &s;he flew, and returned to the break|fa&s;t room, but found there only Mr. Ar|nott, who told her that Mr. Harrel was in the library, with his &s;i&s;ter and &s;ome gentle|men. Cecilia briefly related her bu&s;ine&s;s, and begged he would inform Mr. Harrel &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;peak to him directly. Mr. Arnott &s;hook his head; but obeyed.</P>
<P>They returned together, and immedi|ately</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, gaily, <Q REND="inline">"I am glad you are not gone, for
<PB N="126" REF="126">
we want much to con&s;ult with you. Will you come up &s;tairs?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pre&s;ently,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"but fir&s;t I mu&s;t &s;peak to you about a poor woman with whom I have accidentally been talking, who has begged me to intercede with you to pay a little debt that &s;he thinks you have forgotten, but that probably you have never heard mentioned."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A debt?"</Q> cried he, with an immedi|ate change of countenance, <Q REND="inline">"to whom?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Her name, I think, is Hill; &s;he is wife to the carpenter you employed about a new temple at Violet-Bank.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O what&mdash;what that woman?&mdash;Well, well, I'll &s;ee &s;he &s;hall be paid. Come, let us go to the library."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, with my commi&s;&s;ion &s;o ill exe|cuted? I promi&s;ed to petition for her to have the money directly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pho, pho, there's no &s;uch hurry; I don't know what I have done with her bill."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I'll run and get another."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O upon no account! She may &s;end another in two or three days. She de&s;erves to wait a twelvemonth for her imperti|nence in troubling you at all about it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That was entirely accidental: but in|deed you mu&s;t give me leave to perform my promi&s;e and plead for her. It mu&s;t be al|mo&s;t
<PB N="127" REF="127">
the &s;ame to you whether you pay &s;uch a trifle as 20<HI>l.</HI> now, or a month hence, and to this poor woman, the difference &s;eems little &s;hort of life or death, for &s;he tells me her hu&s;band is dying, and her children are half fami&s;hed, and though &s;he looks an ob|ject of the cruelle&s;t want and di&s;tre&s;s her|&s;elf, &s;he appears to be their only &s;upport."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"what a di&s;mal tale has &s;he been telling you! no doubt &s;he &s;aw you were fre&s;h from the country! But if you give credit to all the farragos of the&s;e trumpery impo&s;|tors, you will never have a moment to your&s;elf, nor a guinea in your pur&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This woman,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"can|not be an impo&s;tor, &s;he carries marks but too evident and too dreadful in her countenance of the &s;ufferings which &s;he relates."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline">"when you know the town better, you will &s;oon &s;ee through tricks of this &s;ort; a &s;ick hu&s;band and five &s;mall children are complaints &s;o &s;tale now, that they &s;erve no other purpo&s;e in the world but to make a joke."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Tho&s;e, however, who can laugh at them mu&s;t have notions of merriment very different to mine. And this poor wo|man, who&s;e cau&s;e I have ventured to under|take, had &s;he no family at all, mu&s;t &s;till and indi&s;putably be an object of pity her|&s;elf,
<PB N="128" REF="128">
for &s;he is &s;o weak &s;he can hardly crawl, and &s;o pallid, that &s;he &s;eems already half dead."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All impo&s;ition, depend upon it! The moment &s;he is out of your &s;ight, her com|plaints will vani&s;h."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay, &s;ir,"</Q> cried Cecilia, a little im|patiently, <Q REND="inline">"there is no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect &s;uch deceit, &s;ince &s;he does not come hither as a beggar, however well the &s;tate of beg|gary may accord with her poverty: &s;he only &s;ollicits the payment of a bill, and if in that there is any fraud, nothing can be &s;o ea&s;y as detection."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Harrel bit his lips at this &s;peech, and for &s;ome in&s;tants looked much di&s;turbed; but &s;oon recovering him&s;elf, he negligently &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Pray how did &s;he get at you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I met her at the &s;treet door. But tell me, is not her bill a ju&s;t one?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I cannot &s;ay; I have never had time to look at it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But you know who the woman is, and that her hu&s;band worked for you, and therefore that in all probability it is right,&mdash;do you not?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, yes, I know who the woman is well enough; &s;he has taken care of that, for &s;he has pe&s;tered me every day the&s;e nine months."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was &s;truck dumb by this &s;peech:
<PB N="129" REF="129">
hitherto &s;he had &s;uppo&s;ed that the di&s;&s;ipa|tion of his life kept him ignorant of his own inju&s;tice; but when &s;he found he was &s;o well informed of it, yet, with &s;uch total indifference, could &s;uffer a poor woman to claim a ju&s;t debt every day for nine months together, &s;he was &s;hocked and a&s;toni&s;hed beyond mea&s;ure. They were both &s;ome time &s;ilent, and then Mr. Harrel, yawning and &s;tretching out his arms, indolently a&s;ked <Q REND="inline">"Pray why does not the man come him&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did I not tell you,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, &s;taring at &s;o ab&s;ent a que&s;tion, <Q REND="inline">"that he was very ill, and unable even to work?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, when he is better,"</Q> added he, moving towards the door, <Q REND="inline">"he may call, and I will talk to him."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, all amazement at this unfeeling behaviour, turned involuntarily to Mr. Ar|nott, with a countenance that appealed for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but Mr. Arnott hung his head, a&s;hamed to meet her eyes, and abruptly left the room.</P>
<P>Mean time Mr. Harrel, half turning back, though without looking Cecilia in the face, carele&s;sly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Well, won't you come?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, &s;ir,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, coldly.</P>
<P>He then returned to the library, leaving her equally di&s;plea&s;ed, &s;urpri&s;ed and di&s;con|certed
<PB N="130" REF="130">
at the conver&s;ation which had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed between them. <Q REND="inline">"Good heaven,"</Q> cried &s;he to her&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"what &s;trange, what cruel in&s;en&s;ibility! to &s;uffer a wretched fa|mily to &s;tarve, from an ob&s;tinate determi|nation to a&s;&s;ert that they can live! to di&s;|tre&s;s the poor by retaining the recompence for which alone they labour, and which at la&s;t they mu&s;t have, merely from indolence, forgetfulne&s;s, or in&s;olence! O how little did my uncle know, how little did I imagine to what a guardian I was intru&s;ted!"</Q> She now felt a&s;hamed even to return to the poor wo|man, though &s;he re&s;olved to do all in her power to &s;often her di&s;appointment, and re|lieve her di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>But before &s;he had quitted the room, one of the &s;ervants came to tell her that his ma&s;ter begged the honor of her company up &s;tairs. <Q REND="inline">"Perhaps he relents!"</Q> thought &s;he; and plea&s;ed with the hope, readily obeyed the &s;ummons.</P>
<P>She found him, his lady, Sir Robert Floyer, and two other gentlemen, all ear|ne&s;tly engaged in an argument over a large table, which was covered with plans and elevations of &s;mall buildings.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel immediately addre&s;&s;ed her with an air of vivacity and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"You are very good for coming; we can &s;ettle no|thing without your advice: pray look at
<PB N="131" REF="131">
the&s;e different plans for our theatre, and tell us which is the be&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia advanced not a &s;tep: the &s;ight of plans for new edifices when the work|men were yet unpaid for old ones; the cruel wantonne&s;s of rai&s;ing fre&s;h fabrics of expen&s;ive luxury, while tho&s;e &s;o lately built had brought their neglected labourers to ruin, excited an indignation &s;he &s;carce thought right to repre&s;s: while the ea&s;y &s;prightline&s;s of the director of the&s;e revels, to whom but the moment before &s;he had re|pre&s;ented the oppre&s;&s;ion of which they made him guilty, filled her with aver&s;ion and di&s;gu&s;t: and, recollecting the charge given her by the &s;tranger at the Opera re|hear&s;al, &s;he re&s;olved to &s;peed her departure to another hou&s;e, internally repeating <Q REND="inline">"Yes, I <HI>will</HI> &s;ave my&s;elf from <HI>the impending de&s;|truction of unfeeling pro&s;perity!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, &s;urpri&s;ed at her &s;ilence and extreme gravity, enquired if &s;he was not well, and why &s;he had put off her vi&s;it to Mi&s;s Larolles? And Sir Robert Floyer, turning &s;uddenly to look at her, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Do you begin to feel the London air already?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia endeavoured to recover her &s;ere|nity, and an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions in her u&s;ual manner; but &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in declining to give any opinion at all about the plans,
<PB N="132" REF="132">
and, after &s;lightly looking at them, left the room.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel, who knew better how to ac|count for her behaviour than he thought proper to declare, &s;aw with concern that &s;he was more &s;eriou&s;ly di&s;plea&s;ed, than he had believed an occurrence which he had regarded as wholly unimportant, could have made her: and therefore, de&s;irous that &s;he &s;hould be appea&s;ed, he followed her out of the library, and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Be|verley, will to-morrow be &s;oon enough for your <HI>Protege&eacute;?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes, no doubt!"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, mo&s;t agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed by the que&s;tion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, then, will you take the trouble to bid her come to me in the morning?"</Q></P>
<P>Delighted at this unexpected commi&s;&s;ion, &s;he thanked him with &s;miles for the office; and as &s;he ha&s;tened down &s;tairs to chear the poor expectant with the welcome intel|ligence, &s;he framed a thou&s;and excu&s;es for the part he had hitherto acted, and without any difficulty, per&s;uaded her&s;elf he began to &s;ee the faults of his conduct, and to medi|tate a reformation.</P>
<P>She was received by the poor creature &s;he &s;o warmly wi&s;hed to &s;erve with a counten|ance already &s;o much enlivened, that &s;he fancied Mr. Harrel had him&s;elf anticipated her intended information: this, however,
<PB N="133" REF="133">
&s;he found was not the ca&s;e, for as &s;oon as &s;he heard his me&s;&s;age, &s;he &s;hook her head, and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Ah, madam, his honour always &s;ays to-morrow! but I can better bear to be di&s;appointed now, &s;o I'll grumble no more; for indeed, madam, I have been ble&s;t enough to-day to comfort me for every thing in the world, if I could but keep from thinking of poor Billy! I could bear all the re&s;t, madam, but whenever my other troubles go off, that comes back to me &s;o much the harder!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There, indeed, I can afford you no re|lief,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"but you mu&s;t try to think le&s;s of him, and more of your hu&s;|band and children who are now alive. To|morrow you will receive your money, and that, I hope, will rai&s;e your &s;pirits. And pray let your hu&s;band have a phy&s;ician, to tell you how to nur&s;e and manage him; I will give you one fee for him now, and if he &s;hould want further advice, don't fear to let me know."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia had again taken out her pur&s;e, but Mrs. Hill, cla&s;ping her hands, called out <Q REND="inline">"Oh madam no! I don't come here to fleece &s;uch goodne&s;s! but ble&s;&s;ed be the hour that brought me here to-day, and if my poor Billy was alive, he &s;hould help me to thank you!"</Q></P>
<P>She then told her that &s;he was now quite
<PB N="134" REF="134">
rich, for while &s;he was gone, a gentleman had come into the room, who had given her five guineas.</P>
<P>Cecilia, by her de&s;cription, &s;oon found this gentleman was Mr. Arnott, and a cha|rity &s;o &s;ympathetic with her own, failed not to rai&s;e him greatly in her favour. But as her benevolence was a &s;tranger to that parade which is only liberal from emulation, when &s;he found more money not immedi|ately wanted, &s;he put up her pur&s;e, and charging Mrs. Hill to enquire for her the next morning when &s;he came to be paid, bid her ha&s;ten back to her &s;ick hu&s;band.</P>
<P>And then, again ordering the carriage to the door, &s;he &s;et off upon her vi&s;it to Mi&s;s Larolles, with a heart happy in the good already done, and happier &s;till in the hope of doing more.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Larolles was out, and &s;he returned home; for &s;he was too &s;anguine in her ex|pectations from Mr. Harrel, to have any de&s;ire of &s;eeking her other guardians. The re&s;t of the day &s;he was more than u&s;ually civil to him, with a view to mark her appro|bation of his good intentions; while Mr. Arnott, gratified by meeting the &s;miles he &s;o much valued, thought his five gnineas amply repaid, independently of the real plea&s;ure which he took in doing good.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. A PROVOCATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning, when breakfa&s;t was over, Cecilia waited with much im|patience to hear &s;ome tidings of the poor carpenter's wife; but though Mr. Harrel, who had always that meal in his own room, came into his lady's at his u&s;ual hour, to &s;ee what was going forward, he did not mention her name. She therefore went into the hall her&s;elf, to enquire among the &s;ervants if Mrs. Hill was yet come?</P>
<P>Yes, they an&s;wered, and had &s;een their ma&s;ter, and was gone.</P>
<P>She then returned to the breakfa&s;t room, where her eagerne&s;s to procure &s;ome inform|ation detained her, though the entrance of Sir Robert Floyer made her wi&s;h to retire. But &s;he was wholly at a lo&s;s whether to impute to general forgetfulne&s;s, or to the failure of performing his promi&s;e, the &s;ilence of Mr. Harrel upon the &s;ubject of her pe|tition.</P>
<P>In a few minutes they were vi&s;ited by Mr. Morrice, who &s;aid he called to ac|quaint
<PB N="136" REF="136">
the ladies that the next morning there was to be a rehear&s;al of a very grand new dance at the Opera-Hou&s;e, where, though admi&s;&s;ion was difficult, if it was agreeable to them to go, he would under|take to introduce them.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel happened to be engaged, and therefore declined the offer. He then turned to Cecilia, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Well, ma'am, when did you &s;ee our friend Monckton?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not &s;ince the rehear&s;al, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is a mighty agreeable fellow,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"and his hou&s;e in the country is charming. One is as ea&s;y at it as at home. Were you ever there, Sir Robert?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not I, truly,"</Q> replied Sir Robert; <Q REND="inline">"what &s;hould I go for?&mdash;to &s;ee an old wo|man with never a tooth in her head &s;itting at the top of the table! Faith I'd go an hundred miles a day for a month never to &s;ee &s;uch a &s;ight again."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O but you don't know how well &s;he does the honours,"</Q> &s;aid Morrice; <Q REND="inline">"and for my part, except ju&s;t at meal times, I always contrive to keep out of her way."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wonder when &s;he intends to die,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Harrel.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She's been a long time about it,"</Q> cried Sir Robert; <Q REND="inline">"but tho&s;e tough old cats la&s;t for ever. We all thought &s;he was going when Monckton married her; how|ever,
<PB N="137" REF="137">
if he had not managed like a drive|ler, he might have broke her heart nine years ago."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure I wi&s;h he had,"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"for &s;he's an odious creature, and u&s;ed always to make me afraid of her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But an old woman,"</Q> an&s;wered Sir Ro|bert, <Q REND="inline">"is a per&s;on who has no &s;en&s;e of decency; if once &s;he takes to living, the devil him&s;elf can't get rid of her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I dare &s;ay,"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he'll pop off before long in one of tho&s;e fits of the a&s;thma. I a&s;&s;ure you &s;ometimes you may hear her wheeze a mile off."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She'll go never the &s;ooner for that,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Robert, <Q REND="inline">"for I have got an old aunt of my own, who has been puffing and blowing as if &s;he was at her la&s;t ga&s;p ever &s;ince I can remember; and for all that, only ye&s;terday, when I a&s;ked her doctor when &s;he'd give up the gho&s;t, he told me &s;he might live the&s;e dozen years."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was by no means &s;orry to have this brutal conver&s;ation interrupted by the entrance of a &s;ervant with a letter for her. She was immediately retiring to read it; but upon the petition of Mr. Monckton, who ju&s;t then came into the room, &s;he only went to a window. The letter was as follows:</P>

<P>The vexation with which Cecilia read this letter was vi&s;ible to the whole company; and while Mr. Arnott looked at her with a wi&s;h of enquiry he did not dare expre&s;s, and Mr. Monckton, under an appearance of inattention, concealed the mo&s;t anxious curio&s;ity, Mr. Morrice alone had courage to interrogate her; and, pertly advancing, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He is a happy man who writ that letter, ma'am, for I am &s;ure you have not read it with indifference."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Were I the writer,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Arnott, tenderly, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure I &s;hould reckon my|&s;elf far otherwi&s;e, for Mi&s;s Beverley &s;eems to have read it with unea&s;ine&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="139">
<Q REND="inline">"However, I have read it,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I a&s;&s;ure you it is not from <HI>any man.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O pray, Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> cried Sir Ro|bert, coming forward, <Q REND="inline">"are you any bet|ter to-day?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, for I have not been ill."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A little vapoured, I thought, ye&s;ter|day; perhaps you want exerci&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h the ladies would put them&s;elves under my care,"</Q> cried Morrice, <Q REND="inline">"and take a turn round the park."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't doubt you, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Monckton, contemptuou&s;ly, <Q REND="inline">"and, but for the check of mode&s;ty, probably there is not a man here who would not wi&s;h the &s;ame."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I could propo&s;e a much better &s;cheme than that,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Robert; <Q REND="inline">"what if you all walk to Harley-&s;treet, and give me your notions of a hou&s;e I am about there? what &s;ay you, Mrs. Harrel?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I &s;hall like it va&s;tly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Done,"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel; <Q REND="inline">"'tis an excellent motion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Come then,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Robert, <Q REND="inline">"let's be off. Mi&s;s Beverley, I hope you have a good warm cloak?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t beg you to excu&s;e my attending you, Sir."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, who had heard this pro|po&s;al with the utmo&s;t dread of its &s;ucce&s;s,
<PB N="140" REF="140">
revived at the calm &s;teadine&s;s with which it was declined. Mr. and Mrs. Harrel both teized Cecilia to con&s;ent; but the haughty Baronet, evidently more offended than hurt by her refu&s;al, pre&s;&s;ed the mat|ter no further: either with her or the re&s;t of the party, and the &s;cheme was dropt entirely.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton failed not to remark this circum&s;tance, which confirmed his &s;u&s;pi|cions, that though the propo&s;al &s;eemed made by chance, its de&s;ign was nothing el&s;e than to obtain Cecilia's opinion con|cerning his hou&s;e. But while this &s;ome|what alarmed him, the unabated in&s;olence of his carriage, and the confident defiance of his pride, &s;till more &s;urprized him; and notwith&s;tanding all he ob&s;erved of Cecilia, &s;eemed to promi&s;e nothing but di&s;like; he could draw no other inference from his behaviour, than that if he admired, he al&s;o concluded him&s;elf &s;ure of her.</P>
<P>This was not a plea&s;ant conjecture, how|ever little weight he allowed to it; and he re&s;olved, by out&s;taying all the company, to have a few minutes private di&s;cour&s;e with her upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In about half an hour, Sir Robert and Mr. Harrel went out together: Mr. Monckton &s;till per&s;evered in keeping his ground, and tried, though already weary,
<PB N="141" REF="141">
to keep up a general conver&s;ation; but what moved at once his wonder and his indignation was the a&s;&s;urance of Morrice, who &s;eemed not only bent upon &s;taying as long as him&s;elf, but determined, by rattling away, to make his own entertainment.</P>
<P>At length a &s;ervant came in to tell Mrs. Harrel that a &s;tranger, who was waiting in the hou&s;e-keeper's room, begged to &s;peak with her upon very particular bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O I know,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"'tis that odious John Groot: do pray, brother, try to get rid of him for me, for he comes to teize me about his bill, and I never know what to &s;ay to him."</Q></P>
<P>"Mr. Arnott went immediately, and Mr. Monckton could &s;carce re&s;train from going too, that he might entreat John Groot by no means to be &s;atisfied without &s;eeing Mrs. Harrel her&s;elf: John Groot, however, wanted not his entreaties, as the &s;ervant &s;oon returned to &s;ummon his lady to the conference.</P>
<P>But though Mr. Monckton now &s;eemed near the completion of his purpo&s;e, Mor|rice &s;till remained; his vexation at this cir|cum&s;tance &s;oon grew intolerable; to &s;ee him&s;elf upon the point of receiving the re|compence of his per&s;everance, by the for|tunate removal of all the ob&s;tacles in its way, and then to have it held from him by
<PB N="142" REF="142">
a young fellow he &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed, and who had no entrance into the hou&s;e but through his own boldne&s;s, and no induce|ment to &s;tay in it but from his own imper|tinence, mortified him &s;o in&s;ufferably, that it was with difficulty he even forbore af|fronting him. Nor would he have &s;crupled a moment de&s;iring him to leave the room, had he not prudently determined to guard with the utmo&s;t &s;edulity again&s;t rai&s;ing any &s;u&s;picions of his pa&s;&s;ion for Cecilia.</P>
<P>He aro&s;e, however, and was moving to|wards her, with intention to occupy a part of a &s;ofa on which &s;he was &s;eated, when Morrice, who was &s;tanding at the back of it, with a &s;udden &s;pring which made the whole room &s;hake, jumpt over, and &s;unk plump into the vacant place him&s;elf, calling out at the &s;ame time, <Q REND="inline">"Come, come, what have you married men to do with young ladies? I &s;hall &s;eize this po&s;t for my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>The rage of Mr. Monckton at this feat, and &s;till more at the words <HI>mar|ried men,</HI> almo&s;t exceeded endurance; he &s;topt &s;hort, and looking at him with a fiercene&s;s that overpowered his di&s;cretion, was bur&s;ting out with, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you are an&mdash;<HI>impudent fellow;</HI>"</Q> but checking him|&s;elf when he got half way, concluded with, <Q REND="inline">"a very facetious gentleman!"</Q></P>
<P>Morrice, who wi&s;hed nothing &s;o little as
<PB N="143" REF="143">
di&s;obliging Mr. Monckton, and who&s;e be|haviour was merely the re&s;ult of levity and a want of early education, no &s;ooner per|ceived his di&s;plea&s;ure, than ri&s;ing with yet more agility than he had &s;eated him&s;elf, he re&s;umed the ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s of which an uncommon flow of &s;pirits had robbed him, and gue&s;&s;ing no other &s;ubject for his anger than the di&s;turbance he had made, he bowed almo&s;t to the ground, fir&s;t to him, and af|terwards to Cecilia, mo&s;t re&s;pectfully beg|ging pardon of them both for his frolic, and prote&s;ting he had no notion he &s;hould have made &s;uch a noi&s;e!</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel and Mr. Arnott now ha&s;|tening back, enquired what had been the matter? Morrice, a&s;hamed of his exploit, and frightened by the looks of Mr. Monck|ton, made an apology with the utmo&s;t hu|mility, and hurried away: and Mr. Monck|ton, hopele&s;s of any better fortune, &s;oon did the &s;ame, gnawn with a cruel di&s;content which he did not dare avow, and longing to revenge him&s;elf upon Morrice, even by per&s;onal cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. A NARRATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE moment Cecilia was at liberty, &s;he &s;ent her own &s;ervant to examine into the real &s;ituation of the carpenter and his family, and to de&s;ire his wife would call upon her as &s;oon as &s;he was at lei&s;ure. The account which he brought back encrea&s;ed her concern for the injuries of the&s;e poor people, and determined her not to re&s;t &s;a|tisfied till &s;he &s;aw them redre&s;&s;ed. He in|formed her that they lived in a &s;mall lodg|ing up two pair of &s;tairs; that there were five children, all girls, the three elde&s;t of whom were hard at work with their mother in matting chair-bottoms, and the fourth, though a mere child, was nur&s;ing the younge&s;t; while the poor carpenter him|&s;elf was confined to his bed, in con&s;equence of a fall from a ladder while working at Violet-Bank, by which he was covered with wounds and contu&s;ions, and an ob|ject of mi&s;ery and pain.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mrs. Hill came, Cecilia &s;ent for her into her own room, where &s;he re|ceived
<PB N="145" REF="145">
her with the mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate tenderne&s;s, and de&s;ired to know when Mr. Harrel talked of paying her?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To-morrow, madam,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, &s;haking her head, <Q REND="inline">"that is always his ho|nour's &s;peech: but I &s;hall bear it while I can. However, though I dare not tell his honour, &s;omething bad will come of it, if I am not paid &s;oon."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you mean, then, to apply to the law?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t not tell you, madam; but to be &s;ure we have thought of it many a &s;ad time and often; but &s;till while we could rub on, we thought it be&s;t not to make enemies: but, indeed, madam, his honour was &s;o hard-hearted this morning, that if I was not afraid you would be angry, I could not tell how to bear it; for when I told him I had no help now, for I had lo&s;t my Billy, he had the heart to &s;ay, &s;o much the bet|ter, there's one the le&s;s of you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But what,"</Q> cried Cecilia, extremely &s;hocked by this unfeeling &s;peech, <Q REND="inline">"is the rea&s;on he gives for di&s;appointing you &s;o often?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He &s;ays, madam, that none of the other workmen are paid yet; and that, to be &s;ure, is very true; but then they can all better afford to wait than we can, for we were the poore&s;t of all, madam, and have
<PB N="146" REF="146">
been mi&s;fortunate from the beginning: and his honour would never have employed us, only he had run up &s;uch a bill with Mr. Wright, that he would not undertake any thing more till he was paid. We were told from the fir&s;t we &s;hould not get our money; but we were willing to hope for the be&s;t, for we had nothing to do, and were hard run, and had never had the offer of &s;o good a job before; and we had a great fa|mily to keep, and many lo&s;&s;es, and &s;o much illne&s;s!&mdash;Oh madam! if you did but know what the poor go through!"</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech opened to Cecilia a new view of life; that a young man could ap|pear &s;o gay and happy, yet be guilty of &s;uch inju&s;tice and inhumanity, that he could take pride in works which not even money had made his own, and live with undimi|ni&s;hed &s;plendor, when his credit it&s;elf began to fail, &s;eemed to her incongruities &s;o irra|tional, that hitherto &s;he had &s;uppo&s;ed them impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>She then enquired, if her hu&s;band had yet had any phy&s;ician?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, madam, I humbly thank your goodne&s;s,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered; <Q REND="inline">"but I am not the poorer for that, for the gentleman was &s;o kind he would take nothing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And does he give you any hopes? what does he &s;ay?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="147">
<Q REND="inline">"He &s;ays he mu&s;t die, madam! but I knew that before."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Poor woman! and what will you do then?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The &s;ame, madam, as I did when I lo&s;t my Billy, work on the harder!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good heaven, how &s;evere a lot! but tell me, why is it you &s;eem to love your Billy &s;o much better than the re&s;t of your children?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e, madam, he was the only boy that ever I had; he was &s;eventeen years old, madam, and as tall and as pretty a lad! and &s;o good, that he never co&s;t me a wet eye till I lo&s;t him. He worked with his father, and all the folks u&s;ed to &s;ay he was the better workman of the two."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what was the occa&s;ion of his death?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A con&s;umption, madam, that wa&s;ted him quite to nothing: and he was ill a long time, and co&s;t us a deal of money, for we &s;pared neither for wine nor any thing, that we thought would but comfort him; and we loved him &s;o we never grudged it. But he died, madam! and if it had not been for very hard work, the lo&s;s of him would quite have broke my heart."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Try, however, to think le&s;s of him,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"and depend upon my &s;peaking again for you to Mr. Harrel. You
<PB N="148" REF="148">
&s;hall certainly have your money; take care, therefore, of your own health, and go home and give comfort to your &s;ick hu&s;band."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh madam,"</Q> cried the poor woman, tears &s;treaming down her cheeks, <Q REND="inline">"you don't know how touching it is to hear gen|tlefolks talk &s;o kindly! And I have been u&s;ed to nothing but roughne&s;s from his ho|nour! But what I mo&s;t fear, madam, is that when my hu&s;band is gone, he will be harder to deal with than ever; for a widow, madam, is always hard to be righted; and I don't expect to hold out long my&s;elf, for &s;ickne&s;s and &s;orrow wear fa&s;t: and then, when we are both gone, who is to help our poor children?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> will!"</Q> cried the generous Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"I am able, and I am willing; you &s;hall not find all the rich hard-hearted, and I will try to make you &s;ome amends for the unkindne&s;s you have &s;uffered."</Q></P>
<P>The poor woman, overcome by a pro|mi&s;e &s;o unexpected, bur&s;t into a pa&s;&s;ionate fit of tears, and &s;obbed out her thanks with a violence of emotion that frightened Ce|cilia almo&s;t as much as it melted her. She endeavoured, by reiterated a&s;&s;urances of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to appea&s;e her, and &s;olemnly pledged her own honour that &s;he &s;hould certainly be paid the following Saturday, which was only three days di&s;tant.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="149">
Mrs. Hill, when a little calmer, dried her eyes, and humbly begging her to for|give a tran&s;port which &s;he could not re|&s;train, mo&s;t gratefully thanked her for the engagement into which &s;he had entered, prote&s;ting that &s;he would not be <HI>trouble|&s;ome to her goodne&s;s</HI> as long as &s;he could help it; <Q REND="inline">"And I believe,"</Q> &s;he continued, <Q REND="inline">"that if his honour will but pay me time enough for the burial, I can make &s;hift with what I have till then. But when my poor Billy died, we were &s;adly off indeed, for we could not bear but bury him prettily, becau&s;e it was the la&s;t we could do for him: but we could hardly &s;crape up enough for it, and yet we all went without our dinners to help forward, except the little one of all. But that did not much matter, for we had no great heart for eating."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I cannot bear this!"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t tell me no more of your Billy; but go home, and chear your &s;pirits, and do every thing in your power to &s;ave your hu&s;band."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will, madam,"</Q> an&s;wered the woman, <Q REND="inline">"and his dying prayers &s;hall ble&s;s you! and all my children &s;hall ble&s;s you, and every night they &s;hall pray for you. And oh!"</Q>&mdash;again bur&s;ting into tears, <Q REND="inline">"that Billy was but alive to pray for you too!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia kindly endeavoured to &s;oothe her,
<PB N="150" REF="150">
but the poor creature, no longer able to &s;uppre&s;s the violence of her awakened &s;or|rows, cried out, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t go, madam, and pray for you at home, for now I have once begun crying again, I don't know how to have done!"</Q> and hurried away.</P>
<P>Cecilia determined to make once more an effort with Mr. Harrel for the payment of the bill, and if that, in two days, did not &s;ucceed, to take up money for the di&s;|charge of it her&s;elf, and re&s;t all her &s;ecu|rity for reimbur&s;ement upon the &s;hame with which &s;uch a proceeding mu&s;t overwhelm him. Offended, however, by the repul&s;e &s;he had already received from him, and di&s;gu&s;ted by all &s;he had heard of his unfeel|ing negligence, &s;he knew not how to ad|dre&s;s him, and re&s;olved upon applying again to Mr. Arnott, who was already ac|quainted with the affair, for advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnott, though extremely gratified that &s;he con&s;ulted him, betrayed by his looks an hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s of &s;ucce&s;s that damped all her expectations. He promi&s;ed, how|ever, to &s;peak to Mr. Harrel upon the &s;ub|ject, but the promi&s;e was evidently given to oblige the fair mediatrix, without any hope of advantage to the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The next morning Mrs. Hill again came, and again without payment was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="151">
Mr. Arnott then, at the reque&s;t of Ce|cilia, followed Mr. Harrel into his room, to enquire into the rea&s;on of this breach of promi&s;e; they continued &s;ome time toge|ther, and when he returned to Cecilia, he told her, that his brother had a&s;&s;ured him he would give orders to Davi&s;on, his gen|tleman, to let her have the money the next day.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure with which &s;he would have heard this intelligence was much checked by the grave and cold manner in which it was communicated: &s;he waited, there|fore, with more impatience than confidence for the re&s;ult of this fre&s;h a&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P>The next morning, however, was the &s;ame as the la&s;t; Mrs. Hill came, &s;aw Da|vi&s;on, and was &s;ent away.</P>
<P>Cecilia, to whom &s;he related her griev|ances, then flew to Mr. Arnott, and en|treated him to enquire at lea&s;t of Davi&s;on why the woman had again been di&s;ap|pointed.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnott obeyed her, and brought for an&s;wer, that Davi&s;on had received no or|ders from his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I entreat you then,"</Q> cried &s;he, with mingled eagerne&s;s and vexation, <Q REND="inline">"to go, for the la&s;t time, to Mr. Harrel. I am &s;orry to impo&s;e upon you an office &s;o di&s;|agreeable, but I am &s;ure you compa&s;&s;ionate
<PB N="152" REF="152">
the&s;e poor people, and will &s;erve them now with your intere&s;t, as you have already done with your pur&s;e. I only wi&s;h to know if there has been any mi&s;take, or if the&s;e de|lays are merely to &s;icken me of petition|ing."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Arnott, with a repugnance to the reque&s;t which he could as ill conceal as his admiration of the zealous reque&s;ter, again forced him&s;elf to follow Mr. Harrel. His &s;tay was not long, and Cecilia at his return perceived that he was hurt and di&s;concerted. As &s;oon as they were alone together, &s;he begged to know what had pa&s;&s;ed? <Q REND="inline">"No|thing,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"that will give you any plea&s;ure. When I entreated my bro|ther to come to the point, he &s;aid it was his intention to pay all his workmen toge|ther, for that if he paid any one &s;ingly, all the re&s;t would be di&s;&s;atisfied."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hould he not pay them at once? There can be no more compari&s;on in the value of the money to him and to them, than, to &s;peak with truth, there is in his and in their right to it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But, madam, the bills for the new hou&s;e it&s;elf are none of them &s;ettled, and he &s;ays that the moment he is known to di&s;charge an account for the Temple, he &s;hall not have any re&s;t for the clamours it
<PB N="153" REF="153">
will rai&s;e among the workmen who were employed about the hou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How infinitely &s;trange!"</Q> exclaimed Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"will he not, then, pay any body?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Next quarter, he &s;ays, he &s;hall pay them all, but, at pre&s;ent, he has a particu|lar call for his money."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia would not tru&s;t her&s;elf to make any comments upon &s;uch an avowal, but thanking Mr. Arnott for the trouble which he had taken, &s;he determined, without any further application, to de&s;ire Mr. Harrel to advance her 20<HI>l.</HI> the next morning, and &s;a|tisfy the carpenter her&s;elf, be the ri&s;k what it might.</P>
<P>The following day, therefore, which was the Saturday when payment was promi&s;ed, &s;he begged an audience of Mr. Harrel; which he immediately granted; but, before &s;he could make her demand, he &s;aid to her, with an air of the utmo&s;t gaiety and good|humour, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Mi&s;s Beverley, how fares it with your <HI>proteg&eacute;e?</HI> I hope, at length, &s;he is contented. But I mu&s;t beg you would charge her to keep her own coun&s;el, as otherwi&s;e &s;he will draw me into a &s;crape I &s;hall not thank her for."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have you, then, paid her?"</Q> cried Ce|cilia, with much amazement.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="154">
<Q REND="inline">"Yes; I promi&s;ed you I would, you know."</Q></P>
<P>This intelligence equally delighted and a&s;toni&s;hed her; &s;he repeatedly thanked him for his attention to her petition, and, eager to communicate her &s;ucce&s;s to Mr. Arnott, &s;he ha&s;tened to find him. <Q REND="inline">"Now,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall torment you no more with painful commi&s;&s;ions; the Hills, at la&s;t, are paid!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"From you, madam,"</Q> an&s;wered he gravely, <Q REND="inline">"no commi&s;&s;ions could be pain|ful."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well but,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, &s;omewhat di&s;appointed, <Q REND="inline">"you don't &s;eem glad of this?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> an&s;wered he, with a forced &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"I am very glad to &s;ee you &s;o."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But how was it brought about? did Mr. Harrel relent? or did you attack him again?"</Q></P>
<P>The he&s;itation of his an&s;wer convinced her there was &s;ome my&s;tery in the tran&s;ac|tion; &s;he began to apprehend &s;he had been deceived, and ha&s;tily quitting the room, &s;ent for Mrs. Hill: but the moment the poor woman appeared, &s;he was &s;atisfied of the contrary, for, almo&s;t frantic with joy and gratitude, &s;he immediately flung her&s;elf upon her knees, to thank her benefactre&s;s for having <HI>&s;een her righted.</HI></P>

Cecilia then gave her &s;ome general ad|vice, promi&s;ed to continue her friend, and offered her a&s;&s;i&s;tance in getting her hu&s;|band into an ho&s;pital: but &s;he told her he had already been in one many months, where he had been pronounced incurable, and therefore was de&s;irous to &s;pend his la&s;t days in his own lodgings.</P>

<P>Struck with his genero&s;ity, &s;he poured forth thanks and prai&s;es &s;o grateful to his ears, that &s;he &s;oon gave him a recompen&s;e which he would have thought cheaply pur|cha&s;ed by half his fortune.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. A MAN OF WEALTH.</HEAD>
<P>THE meanne&s;s with which Mr. Har|rel had a&s;&s;umed the credit, as well as accepted the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Arnott, en|crea&s;ed the di&s;gu&s;t he had already excited in Cecilia, and ha&s;tened her re&s;olution of quitting his hou&s;e: and therefore, without waiting any longer for the advice of Mr. Monckton, &s;he re&s;olved to go in&s;tantly to her other guardians, and &s;ee what better pro&s;pects their habitations might offer.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, &s;he borrowed one of the carriages, and gave orders to be driven into the city, to the hou&s;e of Mr. Briggs.</P>
<P>She told her name, and was &s;hewn, by a little &s;habby foot-boy, into a parlour.</P>
<P>Here &s;he waited, with tolerable patience, for half an hour, but then, imagining the boy had forgotten to tell his ma&s;ter &s;he was in the hou&s;e, &s;he thought it expedient to make &s;ome enquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="157">
No bell, however, could &s;he find, and therefore &s;he went into the pa&s;&s;age in &s;earch of the foot-boy; but, as &s;he was proceed|ing to the head of the kitchen &s;tairs, &s;he was &s;tartled by hearing a man's voice from the upper part of the hou&s;e, exclaiming, in a furious pa&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"Dare &s;ay you've filched it for a di&s;h-clout!"</Q></P>
<P>She called out, however, <Q REND="inline">"Are any of Mr. Briggs's &s;ervants below?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Anan!"</Q> an&s;wered the boy, who came to the foot of the &s;tairs, with a knife in one hand, and an old &s;hoe, upon the &s;ole of which he was &s;harpening it, in the other, <Q REND="inline">"Does any one call?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I do; for I could not find the bell."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, we have no bell in the parlour,"</Q> returned the boy, <Q REND="inline">"ma&s;ter always knocks with his &s;tick."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am afraid Mr. Briggs is too bu&s;y to &s;ee me, and if &s;o, I will come another time."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, ma'am,"</Q> &s;aid the boy, <Q REND="inline">"ma&s;ter's only looking over his things from the wa&s;h."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will you tell him, then, that I am waiting?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I has, ma'am; but ma&s;ter mi&s;&s;es his &s;having-rag, and he &s;ays he won't come to the Mogul till he's found it."</Q> And then he went on with &s;harpening his knife.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="158">
This little circum&s;tance was at lea&s;t &s;uf|ficient to &s;atisfy Cecilia that if &s;he fixed her abode with Mr. Briggs, &s;he &s;hould not have much unea&s;ine&s;s to fear from the &s;ight of extravagance and profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>She returned to the parlour, and after waiting another half hour, Mr. Briggs made his appearance.</P>
<P>Mr. Briggs was a &s;hort, thick, &s;turdy man, with very &s;mall keen black eyes, a &s;quare face, a dark complection, and a &s;nub no&s;e. His con&s;tant dre&s;s, both in winter and &s;ummer, was a &s;nuff-colour &s;uit of cloaths, blue and white &s;peckled wor&s;ted &s;tockings, a plain &s;hirt, and a bob wig. He was &s;eldom without a &s;tick in his hand, which he u&s;ually held to his forehead when not &s;peaking.</P>
<P>This bob wig, however, to the no &s;mall amazement of Cecilia, he now brought in|to the room upon the fore finger of his left hand, while, with his right, he was &s;mooth|ing the curls; and his head, in defiance of the coldne&s;s of the weather, was bald and uncovered.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> cried he, as he entered, <Q REND="inline">"did you think &s;hould not come?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was very willing, &s;ir, to wait your lei&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, ay, knew you had not much to do. Been looking for my &s;having-rag.
<PB N="159" REF="159">
Going out of town; never u&s;e &s;uch a thing at home, paper does as well. Warrant ma&s;ter Harrel never heard of &s;uch a thing; ever &s;ee him comb his own wig? Warrant he don't know how! never tru&s;t mine out of my hands, the boy would tear off half the hair; all one to ma&s;ter Harrel, I &s;up|po&s;e. Well, which is the warmer man, that's all? Will he ca&s;t an account with me?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay to this &s;in|gular exordium, began an apology for not waiting upon him &s;ooner.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, ay,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"always gadding, no getting &s;ight of you. Live a fine life! A pretty guardian ma&s;ter Harrel! and where's t'other? where's old Don Puff|about?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If you mean Mr. Delvile, &s;ir, I have not yet &s;een him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Thought &s;o. No matter, as well not. Only tell you he's a German Duke, or a Spani&s;h Don Ferdinand. Well you've me! poorly off el&s;e. A couple of ignoramu&s;&s;es! don't know when to buy nor when to &s;ell. No doing bu&s;ine&s;s with either of them. We met once or twice; all to no purpo&s;e; only heard Don Vampus count his old Grandees; how will that get intere&s;t for money? Then comes Ma&s;ter Harrel,&mdash;twenty bows to a word,&mdash;looks at a watch,
<PB N="160" REF="160">
&mdash;about as big as a &s;ix-pence,&mdash;poor raw ninny!&mdash;a couple of rare guardians! Well you've me, I &s;ay; mind that!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia was wholly unable to devi&s;e any an&s;wer to the&s;e effu&s;ions of contempt and anger; and therefore his harangue la&s;ted without interruption, till he had exhau&s;ted all his &s;ubjects of complaint, and emptied his mind of ill-will; and then, &s;ettling his wig, he drew a chair near her, and twink|ling his little black eyes in her face, his rage &s;ub&s;ided into the mo&s;t perfect good humour; and, after peering at her &s;ome time with a look of much approbation, he &s;aid, with an arch nod, <Q REND="inline">"Well, my duck, got ever a &s;weet-heart yet?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia laughed, and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"No."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, little rogue, don't believe you! all a fib! better &s;peak out: come, fit I &s;hould know; a'n't you my own ward? to be &s;ure almo&s;t of age, but not quite, &s;o what's that to me?"</Q></P>
<P>She then, more &s;eriou&s;ly, a&s;&s;ured him &s;he had no intelligence of that &s;ort to commu|nicate.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, when you have tell, that's all. Warrant &s;parks enough hankering. I'll give you &s;ome advice. Take care of &s;harpers; don't tru&s;t &s;hoe-buckles, nothing but Bri&s;|tol &s;tones! tricks in all things. A fine gentleman &s;harp as another man. Never
<PB N="161" REF="161">
give your heart to a gold topped cane, no|thing but bra&s;s gilt over. Cheats every where: fleece you in a year; wont leave you a groat. But one way to be &s;afe,&mdash;bring 'em all to me."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia thanked him for his caution, and promi&s;ed not to forget his advice.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's the way,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"bring 'em to me. Won't be bamboozled. Know their tricks. Shew 'em the odds on't. A&s;k for the rent-roll,&mdash;&s;ee how they'll look! &s;tare like &s;tuck pigs! got no &s;uch thing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly, &s;ir, that will be an excellent method of trial."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ay, ay, know the way! &s;oon find if they are above par. Be &s;ure don't mind gold wai&s;tcoats; nothing but tin&s;el, all &s;hew and no &s;ub&s;tance; better leave the mater to me; take care of you my&s;elf; know where to find one will do."</Q></P>
<P>She again thanked him; and, being fully &s;atisfied with this &s;pecimen of his conver&s;a|tion, and unambitious of any further coun|&s;el from him, &s;he aro&s;e to depart.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> repeated he, nodding at her with a look of much kindne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"leave it to me, I &s;ay; I'll get you a careful hu&s;|band, &s;o take no thought about the mat|ter."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, half laughing, begged he would
<PB N="162" REF="162">
not give him&s;elf much trouble, and a&s;&s;ured him &s;he was not in any ha&s;te.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All the better,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"good girl; no fear for you: look out my&s;elf; warrant I'll find one. Not very ea&s;y, neither; hard times! men &s;carce! wars and tumults! &s;tocks low! women chargeable!&mdash;but don't fear; do our be&s;t; get you off &s;oon."</Q></P>
<P>She then returned to her carriage; full of reflection upon the &s;cene in which &s;he had ju&s;t been engaged, and upon the &s;trange|ne&s;s of ha&s;tening from one hou&s;e to avoid a vice the very want of which &s;eemed to render another in&s;upportable! but &s;he now found that though luxury was more baneful in it's con&s;equences, it was le&s;s di&s;gu&s;tful in it's progre&s;s than avarice; yet, in&s;uperably aver&s;e to both, and almo&s;t equally de&s;irous to fly from the unju&s;t extravagance of Mr. Harrel, as from the comfortle&s;s and unne|ce&s;&s;ary par&s;imony of Mr. Briggs, &s;he pro|ceeded in&s;tantly to St. James's-Square, con|vinced that her third guardian, unle&s;s exactly re&s;embling one of the others, mu&s;t inevitably be preferable to both.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. A MAN OF FAMILY.</HEAD>
<P>THE hou&s;e of Mr. Delvile was grand and &s;pacious, fitted up not with mo|dern ta&s;te, but with the magnificence of former times; the &s;ervants were all vete|rans, gorgeous in their liveries, and pro|foundly re&s;pectful in their manners; every thing had an air of &s;tate, but of a &s;tate &s;o gloomy, that while it in&s;pired awe, it re|pre&s;&s;ed plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Cecilia &s;ent in her name and was admit|ted without difficulty, and was then u&s;hered with great pomp through &s;undry apart|ments, and rows of &s;ervants, before &s;he came into the pre&s;ence of Mr. Delvile.</P>
<P>He received her with an air of haughty affability which, to a &s;pirit open and liberal as that of Cecilia, could not fail being ex|tremely offen&s;ive: but too much occupied with the care of his own importance to pe|netrate into the feelings of another, he at|tributed the unea&s;ine&s;s which his reception occa&s;ioned, to the over-awing predomi|ance of &s;uperior rank and con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="164">
He ordered a &s;ervant to bring her a chair, while he only half ro&s;e from his own upon her entering into the room; then, waving his hand and bowing, with a motion that de&s;ired her to be &s;eated, he &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"I am very happy, Mi&s;s Beverley, that you have found me alone; you would rarely have had the &s;ame good fortune. At this time of day I am generally in a crowd. People of large connections have not much lei&s;ure in London, e&s;pecially if they &s;ee a little after their own affairs, and if their e&s;tates, like mine, are di&s;per&s;ed in various parts of the kingdom. However, I am glad it hap|pened &s;o. And I am glad, too, that you have done me the favour of calling without waiting till I &s;ent, which I really would have done as &s;oon as I heard of your arrival, but that the multiplicity of my engage|ments allowed me no re&s;pite."</Q></P>
<P>A di&s;play of importance &s;o o&s;tentatious made Cecilia already half repent her vi&s;it, &s;atisfied that the hope in which &s;he had planned it would be fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Delvile, &s;till imputing to embarra&s;|ment, an inquietude of countenance that proceeded merely from di&s;appointment, imagined her veneration was every moment encrea&s;ing; and therefore, pitying a timi|dity which both gratified and &s;oftened him, and equally plea&s;ed with him&s;elf for in|&s;piring,
<PB N="165" REF="165">
and with her for feeling it, he abated more and more of his greatne&s;s, till he be|came, at length, &s;o infinitely conde&s;cending, with intention to give her courage, that he totally depre&s;&s;ed her with mortification and chagrin.</P>
<P>After &s;ome general enquiries concerning her way of life, he told her that he hoped &s;he was contented with her &s;ituation at the Harrel's, adding <Q REND="inline">"If you have any thing to complain of, remember to whom you may appeal."</Q> He then a&s;ked if &s;he had &s;een Mr. Briggs?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, &s;ir, I am this moment come from his hou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry for it; his hou&s;e cannot be a proper one for the reception of a young lady. When the Dean made application that I would be one of your guardians, I in&s;tantly &s;ent him a refu&s;al, as is my cu&s;tom upon all &s;uch occa&s;ions, which indeed oc|cur to me with a frequency extremely im|portunate: but the Dean was a man for whom I had really a regard, and therefore, when I found my refu&s;al had affected him, I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be prevailed upon to indulge him, contrary not only to my ge|neral rule, but to my inclination."</Q></P>
<P>Here he &s;topt, as if to receive &s;ome com|pliment, but Cecilia, very little di&s;po&s;ed to
<PB N="166" REF="166">
pay him any, went no farther than an incli|nation of the head.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I knew not, however,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"at the time I was induced to give my con&s;ent, with whom I was to be a&s;&s;ociated; nor could I have imagined the Dean &s;o little conver&s;ant with the di&s;tinctions of the world, as to di&s;grace me with inferior co|adjutors: but the moment I learnt the &s;tate of the affair, I in&s;i&s;ted upon withdrawing both my name and countenance."</Q></P>
<P>Here again he pau&s;ed; not in expectation of an an&s;wer from Cecilia, but merely to give her time to marvel in what manner he had at la&s;t been melted.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Dean,"</Q> he re&s;umed, <Q REND="inline">"was then very ill; my di&s;plea&s;ure, I believe, hurt him. I was &s;orry for it; he was a worthy man, and had not meant to offend me; in the end, I accepted his apology, and was even per&s;uaded to accept the office. You have a right, therefore, to con&s;ider your|&s;elf as <HI>per&s;onally</HI> my ward, and though I do not think proper to mix much with your other guardians, I &s;hall always be ready to &s;erve and advi&s;e you, and much plea&s;ed to &s;ee you.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You do me honour, &s;ir;"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, extremely wearied of &s;uch graciou&s;ne&s;s, and ri&s;ing to be gone.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray &s;it &s;till,"</Q> &s;aid he, with a &s;mile;
<PB N="167" REF="167">
<Q REND="inline">"I have not many engagements for this morning. You mu&s;t give me &s;ome account how you pa&s;s your time. Are you much out? The Harrel's, I am told, live at a great expence. What is their e&s;tabli&s;h|ment?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't exactly know, &s;ir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They are decent &s;ort of people, I be|lieve; are they not?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope &s;o, &s;ir!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And they have a tolerable acquain|tance, I believe: I am told &s;o; for I know nothing of them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They have, at lea&s;t, a very numerous one, &s;ir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, my dear,"</Q> &s;aid he, taking her hand," <Q REND="inline">now you have once ventured to come, don't be apprehen&s;ive of repeating your vi|&s;its: I mu&s;t introduce you to Mrs. Delvile; I am &s;ure &s;he will be happy to &s;hew you any kindne&s;s. Come, therefore, when you plea&s;e, and without &s;cruple. I would call upon you my&s;elf, but am fearful of being embarra&s;&s;ed by the people with whom you live."</Q></P>
<P>He then rang his bell, and with the &s;ame ceremonies which had attended her admit|tance, &s;he was conducted back to her car|riage.</P>
<P>And here died away all hope of put|ting into execution, during her minority,
<PB N="168" REF="168">
the plan of which the formation had given her &s;o much plea&s;ure. She found that her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, however wide of her wi&s;hes, was by no means the mo&s;t di&s;agree|able in which &s;he could be placed; &s;he was tired, indeed, of di&s;&s;ipation, and &s;hocked at the &s;ight of unfeeling extravagance; but notwith&s;tanding the hou&s;es of each of her other guardians were exempt from the&s;e particular vices, &s;he &s;aw not any pro&s;pect of happine&s;s with either of them; vulgarity &s;eemed leagued with avarice to drive her from the man&s;ion of Mr. Briggs, and haugh|tine&s;s with o&s;tentation to exclude her from that of Mr. Delvile.</P>
<P>She came back, therefore, to Portman|Square, di&s;appointed in her hopes, and &s;ick both of tho&s;e whom &s;he quitted, and of tho&s;e to whom &s;he was returning; but in going to her own apartment Mrs. Har|rel, eagerly &s;topping her, begged &s;he would come into the drawing-room, where &s;he promi&s;ed her a mo&s;t agreeable &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Cecilia, for an in&s;tant, imagined that &s;ome old acquaintance was ju&s;t arrived out of the country; but, upon her entrance, &s;he &s;aw only Mr. Harrel and &s;ome work|men, and found that the agreeable &s;urpri&s;e was to proceed from the &s;ight of an elegant Awning, prepared for one of the inner apart|ments, to be fixed over a long de&s;ert-table,
<PB N="169" REF="169">
which was to be ornamented with various devices of cut gla&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did you ever &s;ee any thing &s;o beauti|ful in your life?"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel; <Q REND="inline">"and when the table is covered with the coloured ices, and tho&s;e &s;ort of things, it will be as beautiful again. We &s;hall have it ready for Tue&s;day &s;e'nnight.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I under&s;tood you were engaged to go to the Ma&s;querade?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So we &s;hall; only we intend to &s;ee ma&s;ks at home fir&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have &s;ome thoughts,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Har|rel, leading the way to another &s;mall room, <Q REND="inline">"of running up a flight of &s;teps, and a little light gallery here, and &s;o making a little Orche&s;tra. What would &s;uch a thing come to, Mr. Tomkins?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, a trifle, &s;ir,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Tom|kins, <Q REND="inline">"a mere nothing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, then, give orders for it, and let it be done directly. I don't care how &s;light it is, but pray let it be very elegant. Won't it be a great addition, Mi&s;s Beverley?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, &s;ir, I don't think it &s;eems to be very nece&s;&s;ary;"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, who wi&s;hed much to take that moment for reminding him of the debt he had contracted with Mr. Arnott.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Mi&s;s Beverley is &s;o grave!"</Q>
<PB N="170" REF="170">
cried Mrs. Harrel; <Q REND="inline">"nothing of this &s;ort gives her any plea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She has indeed,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, try|ing to &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"not much ta&s;te for the plea&s;ure of being always &s;urrounded by workmen."</Q></P>
<P>And, as &s;oon as &s;he was able, &s;he retired to her room, feeling, both on the part of Mr. Arnott and the Hills, a re&s;entment at the inju&s;tice of Mr. Harrel, which fixed her in the re&s;olution of breaking through that facility of compliance, which had hither|to confined her di&s;approbation to her own brea&s;t, and venturing, henceforward, to mark the opinion &s;he entertained of his con|duct, by con&s;ulting nothing but rea&s;on and principle in her own.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t effort towards this change was made immediately, in begging to be excu&s;ed from accompanying Mrs. Harrel to a large card a&s;&s;embly that evening.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, extremely &s;urpri&s;ed, a&s;ked a thou&s;and times the rea&s;on of her refu&s;al, imagining it to proceed from &s;ome very ex|traordinary cau&s;e; nor was &s;he, without the utmo&s;t difficulty, per&s;uaded at la&s;t that &s;he merely meant to pa&s;s one evening by her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>But the next day, when the refu&s;al was repeated, &s;he was &s;till more incredulous; it &s;eemed to her impo&s;&s;ible that any one who
<PB N="171" REF="171">
had the power to be encircled with com|pany, could by choice &s;pend a &s;econd after|noon alone: and &s;he was &s;o urgent in her reque&s;t to be entru&s;ted with the &s;ecret, that Cecilia found no way left to appea&s;e her, but by frankly confe&s;&s;ing &s;he was weary of eternal vi&s;iting, and &s;ick of living always in a crowd.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Suppo&s;e, then,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;end for Mi&s;s Larolles to come and &s;it with you?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, not without laughing, declined this propo&s;al, a&s;&s;uring her that no &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;|tant was nece&s;&s;ary for her entertainment: yet it was not till after a long contention that &s;he was able to convince her there would be no cruelty in leaving her by her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The following day, however, her trouble dimini&s;hed; for Mrs. Harrel, cea&s;ing to be &s;urpri&s;ed, thought little more of the matter, and forebore any earne&s;tne&s;s of &s;olicitation: and, from that time, &s;he &s;uffered her to fol|low her own humour with very little oppo|&s;ition. Cecilia was much concerned to find her &s;o unmoved; and not le&s;s di&s;appointed at the indifference of Mr. Harrel, who, be|ing &s;eldom of the &s;ame parties with his lady, and &s;eeing her too rarely either to communicate or hear any dome&s;tic occur|rences, far from being &s;truck, as &s;he had hoped, with the new way in which &s;he pa&s;|&s;ed

her time, was &s;carce &s;en&s;ible of the change, and interfered not upon the &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Floyer, who continued to &s;ee her when he dined in Portman-Square, often enquired what &s;he did with her&s;elf in an evening; but never obtaining any &s;atis|factory an&s;wer, he concluded her engage|ments were with people to whom he was a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Arnott felt the cruelle&s;t di&s;ap|pointment in being deprived of the happine&s;s of attending her in her evening's expedi|tions, when, whether he conver&s;ed with her or not, he was &s;ure of the indulgence of &s;eeing and hearing her.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t &s;ufferer from this new re|gulation was Mr. Monckton, who, unable any longer to endure the mortifications of which his morning vi&s;its to Portman-Square had been productive, determined not to tru&s;t his temper with &s;uch provocations in future, but rather to take his chance of meeting with her el&s;ewhere: for which pur|po&s;e, he a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly frequented all public places, and &s;ought acquaintance with every family and every per&s;on he believed to be known to the Harrels: but his patience was unrewarded, and his diligence un&s;uc|ce&s;sful; he met with her no where, and, while he continued his &s;earch, fancied every
<PB N="173" REF="173">
evil power was at work to lead him whither he was &s;ure never to find her.</P>
<P>Mean while Cecilia pa&s;&s;ed her time greatly to her own &s;atisfaction. Her fir&s;t care was to a&s;&s;i&s;t and comfort the Hills. She went her&s;elf to their lodgings, ordered and paid for whatever the phy&s;ician pre|&s;cribed to the &s;ick man, gave clothes to the children, and money and various nece&s;&s;aries to the wife. She found that the poor car|penter was not likely to langui&s;h much longer, and therefore, for the pre&s;ent, only thought of alleviating his &s;ufferings, by procuring him &s;uch indulgencies as were authori&s;ed by his phy&s;ician, and enabling his family to abate &s;o much of their labour as was requi&s;ite for obtaining time to nur&s;e and attend him: but &s;he meant, as &s;oon as the la&s;t duties &s;hould be paid him, to a&s;&s;i&s;t his &s;urvivors in attempting to follow &s;ome better and more profitable bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Her next &s;olicitude was to furni&s;h her|&s;elf with a well-cho&s;en collection of books; and this employment, which to a lover of literature, young and ardent in it's pur&s;uit, is perhaps the mind's fir&s;t luxury, proved a &s;ource of entertainment &s;o fertile and de|lightful that it left her nothing to wi&s;h.</P>
<P>She confined not her acqui&s;itions to the limits of her pre&s;ent power, but, as &s;he was laying in a &s;tock for future as well as
<PB N="174" REF="174">
immediate advantage, &s;he was re&s;trained by no expence from gratifying her ta&s;te and her inclination. She had now entered the la&s;t year of her minority, and therefore had not any doubt that her guardians would permit her to take up whatever &s;um &s;he &s;hould re|quire for &s;uch a purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>And thus, in the exerci&s;e of charity, the &s;earch of knowledge, and the enjoyment of quiet, &s;erenely in innocent philo&s;ophy pa&s;&s;ed the hours of Cecilia.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. A MASQUERADE.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t check this tranquility received was upon the day of the ma&s;querade, the preparations for which have been al|ready mentioned. The whole hou&s;e was then in commotion from various arrange|ments and improvements which were plan|ned for almo&s;t every apartment that was to be opened for the reception of ma&s;ks. Ce|cilia her&s;elf, however little plea&s;ed with the attendant circum&s;tance of wantonly accumulating unnece&s;&s;ary debts, was not the lea&s;t animated of the party: &s;he was a &s;tranger to every diver&s;ion of this &s;ort, and from the novelty of the &s;cene, hoped for uncommon &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>At noon Mrs. Harrel &s;ent for her to con&s;ult upon a new &s;cheme which occurred to Mr. Harrel, of fixing in fanta&s;tic forms &s;ome coloured lamps in the drawing room.</P>
<P>While they were all di&s;cour&s;ing this mat|ter over, one of the &s;ervants, who had two or three times whi&s;pered &s;ome me&s;&s;age to Mr. Harrel, and then retired, &s;aid, in a
<PB N="176" REF="176">
voice not too low to be heard by Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Sir, I can't get him away."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He's an in&s;olent &s;coundrel,"</Q> an&s;wered Mr. Harrel; <Q REND="inline">"however, if I mu&s;t &s;peak to him, I mu&s;t;"</Q> and went out of the room.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel &s;till continued to exerci&s;e her fancy upon this new project, calling both upon Mr. Arnott and Cecilia to ad|mire her ta&s;te and contrivance; till they were all interrupted by the loudne&s;s of a voice from below &s;tairs, which frequently repeated, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I can wait no longer! I have been put off till I can be put off no more!"</Q></P>
<P>Startled by this, Mrs. Harrel cea&s;ed her employment, and they all &s;tood &s;till and &s;ilent. They then heard Mr. Harrel with much &s;oftne&s;s an&s;wer, <Q REND="inline">"Good Mr. Raw|lins have a little patience; I &s;hall receive a large &s;um of money to-morrow, or next day, and you may then depend upon being paid."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> cried the man, <Q REND="inline">"you have &s;o often told me the &s;ame, that it goes ju&s;t for nothing: I have had a right to it a long time, and I have a bill to make up that can't be waited for any longer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly, Mr. Rawlins,"</Q> replied Mr. Harrel, with &s;till increa&s;ing gentlene&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"and certainly you &s;hall have it: nobody means to di&s;pute your right; I only beg
<PB N="177" REF="177">
you to wait a day, or two days at furthe&s;t, and you may then depend upon being paid. And you &s;hall not be the wor&s;e for oblig|ing me; I will never employ any body el&s;e, and I &s;hall have occa&s;ion for you very &s;oon, as I intend to make &s;ome alterations at Violet-Bank that will be very con&s;ider|able."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> &s;aid the man, &s;till louder, <Q REND="inline">"it is of no u&s;e your employing me, if I can never get my money: All my workmen mu&s;t be paid whether I am or no; and &s;o, if I mu&s;t needs &s;peak to a lawyer, why there's no help for it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did you ever hear any thing &s;o im|pertinent?"</Q> exclaimed Mrs. Harrel; <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure Mr. Harrel will be very much to blame, if ever he lets that man do any thing more for him."</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t then Mr. Harrel appeared, and, with an air of affected unconcern, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Here's the mo&s;t in&s;olent ra&s;cal of a ma&s;on be|low &s;tairs I ever met with in my life; he has come upon me, quite unexpectedly, with a bill of 400<HI>l.</HI> and won't leave the hou&s;e without the money. Brother Arnott, I wi&s;h you would do me the favour to &s;peak to the fellow, for I could not bear to &s;tay with him any longer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you wi&s;h me to give him a draught for the money upon my own banker?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="178">
<Q REND="inline">"That would be va&s;tly obliging,"</Q> an|&s;wered Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"and I will give you my note for it directly. And &s;o we &s;hall get rid of this fellow at once: and he &s;hall do nothing more for me as long as he lives. I will run up a new building at Violet|Bank next &s;ummer, if only to &s;hew him what a job he has lo&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pay the man at once, there's a good brother,"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"and let's hear no more of him."</Q></P>
<P>The two gentlemen then retired to ano|ther room, and Mrs. Harrel, after prai&s;ing the extreme good-nature of her brother, of whom &s;he was very fond, and declar|ing that the ma&s;on's impertinence had quite frightened her, again returned to her plan of new decorations.</P>
<P>Cecilia, amazed at this indifference to the &s;tate of her hu&s;band's affairs, began to think it was her own duty to talk with her upon the &s;ubject: and therefore, after a &s;ilence &s;o marked that Mrs. Harrel en|quired into its rea&s;on, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Will you pardon me, my dear friend, if I own I am rather &s;urprized to &s;ee you continue the&s;e preparations?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, why?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e any fre&s;h unnece&s;&s;ary expences ju&s;t now, till Mr. Harrel actually receives the money he talks of&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="179">
<Q REND="inline">"Why, my dear, the expence of &s;uch a thing as this is nothing; in Mr. Harrel's affairs I a&s;&s;ure you it will not be at all felt. Be&s;ides, he expects money &s;o &s;oon, that it is ju&s;t the &s;ame as if he had it already."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, unwilling to be too officious, began then to expre&s;s her admiration of the goodne&s;s and genero&s;ity of Mr. Arnott; taking frequent occa&s;ion, in the cour&s;e of her prai&s;e, to in&s;inuate that tho&s;e only can be properly liberal, who are ju&s;t and oeco|nomical.</P>
<P>She had prepared no ma&s;querade habit for this evening, as Mrs. Harrel, by who&s;e direction &s;he was guided, informed her it was not nece&s;&s;ary for ladies to be ma&s;ked at home, and &s;aid &s;he &s;hould receive her company her&s;elf in a dre&s;s which &s;he might wear upon any other occa&s;ion. Mr. Harrel, al&s;o, and Mr. Arnott made not any alter|ation in their appearance.</P>
<P>At about eight o'clock the bu&s;ine&s;s of the evening began; and before nine, there were &s;o many ma&s;ks that Cecilia wi&s;hed &s;he had her&s;elf made one of the number, as &s;he was far more con&s;picuous in being almo&s;t the only female in a common dre&s;s, than any ma&s;querade habit could have made her. The novelty of the &s;cene, however, joined to the general air of gaiety diffu&s;ed through|out the company, &s;hortly le&s;&s;ened her em|barra&s;&s;ment;

<PB N="180" REF="180">
and, after being &s;omewhat fa|miliarized to the abruptne&s;s with which the ma&s;ks approached her, and the freedom with which they looked at or addre&s;&s;ed her, the fir&s;t confu&s;ion of her &s;ituation &s;ub&s;ided, and in her curio&s;ity to watch others; &s;he cea&s;ed to ob&s;erve how much &s;he was watched her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Her expectations of entertainment were not only fulfilled but &s;urpa&s;&s;ed; the variety of dre&s;&s;es, the madley of characters, the quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of figures, and the ludi|crous mixture of groupes, kept her atten|tion unwearied: while the conceited efforts at wit, the total thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of con|&s;i&s;tency, and the ridiculous incongruity of the language with the appearance, were in|citements to &s;urpri&s;e and diver&s;ion without end. Even the local cant of, <HI>Do you know me? Who are you?</HI> and <HI>I know you;</HI> with the &s;ly pointing of the finger, the arch nod of the head, and the pert &s;queak of the voice, though weari&s;ome to tho&s;e who frequent &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies, were, to her un|hackneyed ob&s;ervation, additional &s;ubjects of amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Soon after nine o'clock, every room was occupied, and the common crowd of regular ma&s;queraders were di&s;per&s;ed through the va|rious apartments. Dominos of no charac|ter, and fancy-dre&s;&s;es of no meaning, made,
<PB N="181" REF="181">
as is u&s;ual at &s;uch meetings, the general herd of the company: for the re&s;t, the men were Spaniards, chimney-&s;weepers, Turks, watchmen, conjurers, and old women; and the ladies, &s;hepherde&s;&s;es, orange girls, Cir|ca&s;&s;ians, gip&s;eys, haymakers, and &s;ultanas.</P>
<P>Cecilia had, as yet, e&s;caped any addre&s;s beyond the cu&s;tomary enquiry of <HI>Do you know me?</HI> and a few pa&s;&s;ing compliments; but when the rooms filled, and the general crowd gave general courage, &s;he was at|tacked in a manner more pointed and &s;in|gular.</P>
<P>The very fir&s;t ma&s;k who approached her, &s;eemed to have nothing le&s;s in view than preventing the approach of every other: yet had he little rea&s;on to hope favour for him&s;elf, as the per&s;on he repre&s;ented, of all others lea&s;t alluring to the view, was the devil! He was black from head to foot, &s;ave that two red horns &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from his forehead; his face was &s;o completely covered, that the &s;ight only of his eyes was vi&s;ible, his feet were cloven, and in his right hand he held a wand the colour of fire.</P>
<P>Waving this wand as he advanced to|wards Cecilia, he cleared a &s;emi-circular &s;pace before her chair, thrice with the mo&s;t profound reverence bowed to her, thrice turned him&s;elf around with &s;undry
<PB N="182" REF="182">
grimaces, and then fiercely planted him&s;elf at her &s;ide.</P>
<P>Cecilia was amu&s;ed by his mummery, but felt no great delight in his guar|dian&s;hip, and, after a &s;hort time, aro&s;e, with intention to walk to another place; but the black gentleman, adroitly moving round her, held out his wand to ob&s;truct her pa&s;&s;age, and therefore, preferring cap|tivity to re&s;i&s;tance, &s;he was again obliged to &s;eat her&s;elf.</P>
<P>An Hot&s;pur, who ju&s;t then made his appearance, was now &s;trutting boldly to|wards her; but the devil, ru&s;hing furiou&s;ly forwards, placed him&s;elf immediately be|tween them. Hot&s;pur, putting his arms a-kembo with an air of defiance, gave a loud &s;tamp with his right foot, and then&mdash;marched into another room!</P>
<P>The victorious devil o&s;tentatiou&s;ly waved his wand, and returned to his &s;tation.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnott, who had never moved two yards from Cecilia, knowing her too well to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he received any plea&s;ure from being thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, mode&s;tly advanced to offer his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in relea&s;ing her from eonfinement; but the devil, again de&s;crib|ing a circle with his wand, gave him three &s;uch &s;mart raps on the head that his hair was di&s;ordered, and his face covered with powder. A general laugh &s;ucceeded, and
<PB N="183" REF="183">
Mr. Arnott, too diffident to brave raillery, or with&s;tand &s;hame, retired in confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The black gentleman &s;eemed now to have all authority in his own hands, and his wand was brandi&s;hed with more ferocity than ever, no one again venturing to in|vade the domain he thought fit to appro|priate for his own.</P>
<P>At length, however, a Don Quixote ap|peared, and every ma&s;k in the room was eager to point out to him the impri&s;on|ment of Cecilia.</P>
<P>This Don Quixote was accoutered with tolerable exactne&s;s according to the de&s;crip|tion of the admirable Cervantes; his ar|mour was ru&s;ty, his helmet was a barber's ba&s;on, his &s;hield, a pewter di&s;h, and his lance, an old &s;word fa&s;tened to a &s;lim cane. His figure, tall and thin, was well adapted to the character he repre&s;ented, and his ma&s;k, which depictured a lean and haggard face, worn with care, yet fiery with crazy pa&s;&s;ions, exhibited with propriety the mo&s;t &s;triking, the knight of the doleful coun|tenance.</P>
<P>The complaints again&s;t the devil with which immediately and from all quarters he was a&s;&s;ailed, he heard with the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn taciturnity: after which, making a motion for general &s;ilence, he &s;talked ma|je&s;tically towards Cecilia, but &s;topping &s;hort of the limits pre&s;cribed by her guard,
<PB N="184" REF="184">
he ki&s;&s;ed his &s;pear in token of allegiance, and then, &s;lowly dropping upon one knee, began the following addre&s;s: <Q REND="inline"><P>"Mo&s;t incomparable Prince&s;s!</P>
<P>THUS humbly pro&s;trate at the feet of your divine and ineffable beauty, graciou&s;ly permit the mo&s;t pitiful of your &s;ervitors, Don Quixote De la Mancha, from your high and tender grace, to &s;alute the fair boards, which &s;u&s;tain your corporeal ma|chine."</P></Q></P>
<P>Then, bending down his head, he ki&s;&s;ed the floor; after which, rai&s;ing him&s;elf upon his feet, he proceeded in his &s;peech.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Report, O mo&s;t fair and unmatchable virgin! daringly affirmeth, that a certain di&s;|courteous per&s;on, who calleth him&s;elf the de|vil, even now, and in thwart of your fair in|clinations, keepeth and detaineth your irra|diant frame in ho&s;tile thraldom. Suffer then, magnanimous and undi&s;cribable lady! that I, the mo&s;t groveling of your unworthy va&s;&s;als, do &s;ift the fair truth out of this foul &s;ieve, and, ob&s;equiou&s;ly bending to your divine attractions, conjure your high|ne&s;s veritably to inform me, if that ho|nourable chair which haply &s;upports your terre&s;trial perfections, containeth the in|imitable burthen with the free and legal con&s;ent of your cele&s;tial &s;pirit?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="185">
Here he cea&s;ed: and Cecilia, who laughed at this characteri&s;tic addre&s;s, though &s;he had not courage to an&s;wer it, again made an effort to quit her place, but again by the wand of her black per&s;ecutor was pre|vented.</P>
<P>This little incident was an&s;wer &s;ufficient for the valorous knight, who indignantly exclaimed, <Q REND="inline"><P>"Sublime Lady!</P>
<P>I BESEECH but of your exqui|&s;ite mercy to refrain mouldering the clay compo&s;ition of my unworthy body to im|palpable du&s;t, by the refulgence of tho&s;e bright &s;tars vulgarly called eyes, till I have lawfully wreaked my vengeance upon this unobliging caitiff, for his mo&s;t di&s;loyal ob&s;truction of your highne&s;&s;es adorable plea|&s;ure."</P></Q></P>
<P>Then, bowing low, he turned from her, and thus addre&s;&s;ed his intended antagoni&s;t: <Q REND="inline"><P>"Uncourtly Mi&s;creant,</P>
<P>THE black garment which envellopeth thy mo&s;t unplea&s;ant per&s;on, &s;eemeth even of the mo&s;t ravi&s;hing whitene&s;s, in com|pare of the black bile which floateth within thy &s;able exterior. Behold, then, my
<PB N="186" REF="186">
gauntlet! yet ere I deign to be the in&s;tru|ment of thy extirpation, O thou mo&s;t mean and ignoble enemy! that the honour of Don Quixote de la Mancha may not be &s;ullied by thy extinction, I do here confer upon thee the honour of knighthood, dubbing thee, by my own &s;word, Don Devil, knight of the horrible phy&s;iognomy."</P></Q></P>
<P>He then attempted to &s;trike his &s;houlder with his &s;pear, but the black gentleman, adroitly eluding the blow, defended him&s;elf with his wand: a mock fight en&s;ued, con|ducted on both &s;ides with admirable dex|terity; but Cecilia, le&s;s eager to view it than to become again a free agent, made her e&s;cape into another apartment; while the re&s;t of the ladies, though they almo&s;t all &s;creamed, jumped upon chairs and &s;ofas to peep at the combat.</P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion, the wand of the knight of the horrible phy&s;iognomy, was broken again&s;t the &s;hield of the knight of the doleful countenance; upon which Don Quixote called out <HI>victoria!</HI> the whole room ecchoed the &s;ound; the unfortunate new knight retired abruptly into another apartment, and the conquering Don, &s;eiz|ing the fragments of the weapon of his vanqui&s;hed enemy, went out in &s;earch of the lady for who&s;e relea&s;ement he had
<PB N="187" REF="187">
fought: and the moment he found her, pro&s;trating both him&s;elf and the trophies at her feet, he again pre&s;&s;ed the floor with his lips, and then, &s;lowly ari&s;ing, repeated his reverences with added formality, and, without waiting her acknowledgments, gravely retired.</P>
<P>The moment he departed a Minerva, not &s;tately nor au&s;tere, not marching in war|like maje&s;ty, but gay and airy,</P>
<P>Tripping on light fanta&s;tic toe, ran up to Cecilia, and &s;queaked out, <Q REND="inline">"Do you know me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, in&s;tantly recol|lecting Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"by your <HI>appear|ance,</HI> I own! but by your <HI>voice,</HI> I think I can gue&s;s you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was mon&s;trous &s;orry,"</Q> returned the godde&s;s, without under&s;tanding this di&s;tinc|tion, <Q REND="inline">"that I was not at home when you called upon me. Pray how do you like my dre&s;s? I a&s;&s;ure you I think it's the prettie&s;t here. But do you know there's the mo&s;t &s;hocking thing in the world happened in the next room? I really be|lieve there's a common chimney-&s;weeper got in! I a&s;&s;ure you its enough to frighten one to death, for every time he moves the &s;oot &s;mells &s;o you can't think; quite real &s;oot, I a&s;&s;ure you! only conceive how
<PB N="188" REF="188">
na&s;ty! I declare I wi&s;h with all my heart it would &s;uffocate him!"</Q></P>
<P>Here &s;he was interrupted by the re-ap|pearance of <HI>Don Devil;</HI> who, looking around him, and perceiving that his anta|goni&s;t was gone, again advanced to Cecilia: not, however, with the authority of his fir&s;t approach, for with his wand he had lo&s;t much of his power; but to recom|pen&s;e him&s;elf for this di&s;grace, he had re|cour&s;e to another method equally effectual for keeping his prey to him&s;elf, for he be|gan a growling, &s;o di&s;mal and di&s;agreeable, that while many of the ladies, and, among the fir&s;t, the <HI>Godde&s;s of Wi&s;dom and Courage,</HI> ran away to avoid him, the men all &s;tood aloof to watch what next was to follow.</P>
<P>Cecilia now became &s;eriou&s;ly unea&s;y; for &s;he was made an object of general atten|tion, yet could neither &s;peak nor be &s;poken to. She could &s;ugge&s;t no motive for be|haviour &s;o whim&s;ical, though &s;he imagined the only per&s;on who could have the a&s;&s;ur|ance to practice it was Sir Robert Floyer.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time &s;pent thus di&s;agreeably, a white domino, who for a few minutes had been a very attentive &s;pectator, &s;uddenly came forward, and exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I'll cro&s;s him though he bla&s;t me!</HI>"</Q> ru&s;hed upon the fiend, and gra&s;ping one of his horns, called out to a Harlequin who &s;tood near him,
<PB N="189" REF="189">
<Q REND="inline">"Harlequin! do you fear to fight the devil?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not I truly!"</Q> an&s;wered Harlequin, who&s;e voice immediately betrayed young Morrice, and who, i&s;&s;uing from the crowd, whirled him&s;elf round before the black gentleman with yet more agility than he had him&s;elf done before Cecilia, giving him, from time to time, many &s;mart blows on his &s;houlders, head and back with his wooden &s;word.</P>
<P>The rage of <HI>Don Devil</HI> at this attack &s;eemed &s;omewhat beyond what a ma&s;que|rade character rendered nece&s;&s;ary; he foamed at the mouth with re&s;entment, and defended him&s;elf with &s;o much vehemence, that he &s;oon drove poor Harlequin into another room: but, when he would have returned to his prey, the genius of panto|mime, curbed, but not &s;ubdued, at the in|&s;tigation of the white domino returned to the charge, and by a perpetual rotation of attack and retreat, kept him in con&s;tant employment, pur&s;uing him from room to room, and teazing him without ce&s;&s;ation or mercy.</P>
<P>Mean time Cecilia, delighted at being relea&s;ed, hurried into a corner, where &s;he hoped to breathe and look on in quiet; and the white domino, having exhorted Harlequin to torment the tormentor, and
<PB N="190" REF="190">

<P><Q REND="inline">"It is you,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I ought to thank for it, which indeed I do mo&s;t heartily. I was &s;o tired of confinement, that my mind &s;eemed almo&s;t as little at li|berty as my per&s;on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your per&s;ecutor, I pre&s;ume,"</Q> &s;aid the domino, <Q REND="inline">"is known to you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope &s;o,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e there is one man I &s;u&s;pect, and I &s;hould be &s;orry to find there was another equally di&s;agreeable."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, depend upon it,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"there are many who would be happy to confine you in the &s;ame manner; neither have you much cau&s;e for complaint; you have, doubtle&s;s, been the aggre&s;&s;or, and played this game your&s;elf without mercy, for I read in your face the captivity of thou&s;ands: have you, then, any right to be offended at the &s;pirit of retaliation which one, out of &s;uch numbers, has courage to exert in return?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I took you for my defender! whence is it you are be|come my accu&s;er?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"From &s;eeing the danger to which my incautions knight errantry has expo&s;ed me; I begin, indeed, to take you for a very mi&s;chievous &s;ort of per&s;on, and I fear the poor devil from whom I re&s;cued you will be amply revenged for his di&s;grace, by
<PB N="191" REF="191">
finding that the fir&s;t u&s;e you make of your freedom is to doom your deliverer to bon|dage."</Q></P>
<P>Here they were di&s;turbed by the extreme loquacity of two oppo&s;ite parties: and li&s;|tening attentively, they heard from one &s;ide, <Q REND="inline">"My angel! faire&s;t of creatures! godde&s;s of my heart!"</Q> uttered in accents of rapture; while from the other, the vo|ciferation was &s;o violent they could di|&s;tinctly hear nothing.</P>
<P>The white domino &s;atisfied his curio&s;ity by going to both parties; and then, re|turning to Cecilia, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Can you con|jecture who was making tho&s;e &s;oft &s;peeches? a Shylock! his knife all the time in his hand, and his de&s;ign, doubtle&s;s, to <HI>cut as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ar the heart as po&s;&s;ible!</HI> while the loud cackling from the other &s;ide, is owing to the riotous merriment of a noi&s;y Mentor! when next I hear a di&s;turbance, I &s;hall expect to &s;ee &s;ome &s;impering Pythagoras &s;tunned by his talkative di&s;ciples."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To own the truth,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"the almo&s;t univer&s;al neglect of the characters a&s;&s;umed by the&s;e ma&s;quers, has been the chief &s;ource of my entertainment this even|ing: for at a place of this &s;ort, the next be&s;t thing to a character well &s;upported, is a character ridiculou&s;ly burle&s;qued."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You cannot, then, have wanted amu&s;e|ment,"</Q>
<PB N="192" REF="192">
returned the domino, <Q REND="inline">"for among all the per&s;ons a&s;&s;embled in the&s;e apart|ments, I have &s;een only three who have &s;eemed con&s;cious that any change but that of dre&s;s was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;gui&s;e them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And pray who are tho&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A Don Quixote, a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, and your friend the devil."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O call him not my friend,"</Q> exclaimed Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"for indeed in or out of that garb he is particularly my aver&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>My</HI> friend, then, I will call him,"</Q> &s;aid the Domino, <Q REND="inline">"for &s;o, were he ten de|vils, I mu&s;t think him, &s;ince I owe to him the honour of conver&s;ing with you. And, after all, to give him his due, to which, you know, he is even proverbially entitled, he has &s;hewn &s;uch abilities in the perform|ance of his part, &s;o much &s;kill in the di&s;|play of malice, and &s;o much per&s;everance in the art of tormenting, that I cannot but re&s;pect his ingenuity and capacity. And, indeed, if in&s;tead of an evil genius, he had repre&s;ented a guardian angel, he could not have &s;hewn a more refined ta&s;te in his choice of an object to hover about."</Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t then they were approached by a young hay-maker, to whom the white domino called out <Q REND="inline">"You look as gay and as bri&s;k as if fre&s;h from the hay-field after only half a day's work. Pray how is
<PB N="193" REF="193">
it you pretty la&s;&s;es find employment for the winter?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How?"</Q> cried &s;he, pertly, <Q REND="inline">"why the &s;ame as for the &s;ummer!"</Q> And plea&s;ed with her own readine&s;s at repartee, without feeling the ignorance it betrayed, &s;he tript lightly on.</P>
<P>Immediately after, the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, mentioned by the white domino, advanced to Cecilia. His dre&s;s was merely a long wrapping gown of green &s;tuff, a pair of red &s;lippers, and a woollen night-cap of the &s;ame colour; while, as the &s;ymbol of his profe&s;&s;ion, he held a rod in his hand.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, fair lady,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"how &s;ooth|ing were it to the au&s;terity of my life, how &s;oftening to the rigidity of my manners, might I&mdash;without a <HI>breaking out of bounds</HI> which I ought to be the fir&s;t to di&s;courage, and a <Q REND="inline">"confu&s;ion to all order"</Q> for which the &s;chool-boy &s;hould him&s;elf cha&s;ti&s;e his ma&s;ter, be permitted to ca&s;t at your feet this emblem of my authority! and to for|get, in the &s;oftne&s;s of your conver&s;ation, all the roughne&s;s of di&s;cipline!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I will not be an&s;werable for &s;uch corruption of ta&s;te!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This repul&s;e,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"is ju&s;t what I feared; for alas! under what pre|tence could a poor mi&s;erable country pe|dagogue pre&s;ume to approach you? Should
<PB N="194" REF="194">
I examine you in the dead languages, would not your living accents charm from me all power of reproof? Could I look at you, and hear a fal&s;e concord? Should I doom you to water-gruel as a dunce, would not my &s;ub|&s;equent remor&s;e make me want it my&s;elf as a mad-man? Were your fair hand &s;pread out to me for correction, &s;hould I help ap|plying my lips to it, in&s;tead of my rat-tan? If I ordered you to be <HI>called up,</HI> &s;hould I ever remember to have you &s;ent back? And if I commanded you to &s;tand in a corner, how &s;hould I forbear following you thither my&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, who had no difficulty in know|ing this pretended &s;chool-ma&s;ter for Mr. Go&s;port, was readily beginning to propo&s;e conditions, for according him her favour, when their ears were a&s;&s;ailed by a forced phthi&s;ical cough, which they found pro|ceeded from an apparent old woman, who was a young man in di&s;gui&s;e, and who&s;e hobbling gait, grunting voice, and mo&s;t grievous a&s;thmatic complaints, &s;eemed greatly enjoyed and applauded by the com|pany.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How true is it, yet how incon&s;i&s;tent,"</Q> cried the white domino, <Q REND="inline">"that while we all de&s;ire to live long, we have all an horror of being old! The figure now pa&s;&s;ing is not meant to ridicule any particular per&s;on, nor to &s;tigmatize any particular ab&s;urdity; its
<PB N="195" REF="195">
&s;ole view is to expo&s;e to contempt and deri|&s;ion the general and natural infirmities of age! and the de&s;ign is not more di&s;gu&s;ting than impolitic; for why, while &s;o carefully we guard from all approaches of death, &s;hould we clo&s;e the only avenues to happi|ne&s;s in long life, re&s;pect and tenderne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, delighted both by the under|&s;tanding and humanity of her new acquain|tance, and plea&s;ed at being joined by Mr. Go&s;port, was beginning to be perfectly &s;a|tisfied with her &s;ituation, when, creeping &s;oftly towards her, &s;he again perceived the black gentleman.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah!"</Q> cried &s;he, with &s;ome vexation, <Q REND="inline">"here comes my old tormentor! &s;creen me from him if po&s;&s;ible, or he will again make me his pri&s;oner."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fear not,"</Q> cried the white domino, <Q REND="inline">"he is an evil &s;pirit, and we will &s;urely lay him. If one &s;pell fails, we mu&s;t try another."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then perceiving Mr. Arnott, beg|ged he would al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t in barricading her from the fiend who &s;o ob&s;tinately pur&s;ued her.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnott mo&s;t gratefully acceded to the propo&s;al; and the white domino, who acted as commanding officer, a&s;&s;igned to each his &s;tation: he de&s;ired Cecilia would keep quietly to her &s;eat, appointed the
<PB N="196" REF="196">
&s;chool-ma&s;ter to be her guard on the left, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion him&s;elf of the oppo&s;ite po&s;t, and ordered Mr. Arnott to &s;tand centinal in front.</P>
<P>This arrangement being &s;ettled, the guards of the right and left wings in&s;tantly &s;ecured their places; but while Mr. Arnott was con&s;idering whether it were better to face the be&s;ieged, or the enemy, the arch|foe ru&s;hed &s;uddenly before him, and laid him&s;elf down at the feet of Cecilia.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnott, extremely di&s;concerted, be|gan a &s;erious expo&s;tulation upon the ill|breeding of this behaviour; but the devil, re&s;ting all excu&s;e upon &s;upporting his cha|racter, only an&s;wered by growling.</P>
<P>The white domino &s;eemed to he&s;itate for a moment in what manner to conduct him|&s;elf, and with a quickne&s;s that marked his chagrin, &s;aid to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"You told me you knew him,&mdash;has he any right to follow you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If he thinks he has,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, a little alarmed by his que&s;tion, <Q REND="inline">"this is no time to di&s;pute it."</Q></P>
<P>And then, to avoid any hazard of alterca|tion, &s;he di&s;creetly forebore making further complaints, preferring any per&s;ecution to &s;eriou&s;ly remon&s;trating with a man of &s;o much in&s;olence as the Baronet.</P>
<P>The &s;chool-ma&s;ter, laughing at the whole
<PB N="197" REF="197">
tran&s;action, only &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"And pray, madam, after playing the devil with all mankind, what right have you to complain that one man plays the devil with you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We &s;hall, at lea&s;t, fortify you,"</Q> &s;aid the white domino, <Q REND="inline">"from any other a&s;&s;ail|ant: no three-headed Cerberus could pro|tect you more effectually: but you will not, therefore, fancy your&s;elf in the lower re|gions, for, if I mi&s;take not, the torment of <HI>three guardians</HI> is nothing new to you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And how,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, &s;urpri&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hould you know of my three guardians? I hope I am not quite encompa&s;&s;ed with evil &s;pirits!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> an&s;wered he; <Q REND="inline">"you will find me as inoffen&s;ive as the hue of the domino I wear;&mdash;and would I could add as in|&s;en&s;ible!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This black gentleman,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;chool|ma&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"who, and very innocently, I was going to call your <HI>black-guard,</HI> has as noble and fiend-like a di&s;po&s;ition as I remember to have &s;een; for without even attempting to take any diver&s;ion him&s;elf, he &s;eems gra|tified to his heart's content, in excluding from it the lady he &s;erves."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He does me an honour I could well di&s;pen&s;e with,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"but I hope he has &s;ome &s;ecret &s;atisfaction in his &s;itua|tion which pays him for its apparent incon|venience."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="198">
Here the black gentleman half rai&s;ed him&s;elf, and attempted to take her hand; &s;he &s;tarted, and with much di&s;plea|&s;ure drew it back: he then growled, and again &s;unk pro&s;trate.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This is a fiend,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;chool-ma&s;|ter, <Q REND="inline">"who to him&s;elf &s;ayeth <HI>Budge not!</HI> let his con&s;cience never &s;o often &s;ay <HI>budge!</HI> Well, fair lady, your fortifications, however, may now be deemed impregnable, &s;ince I, with a flouri&s;h of my rod, can keep off the young by recollection of the pa&s;t, and &s;ince the fiend, with a jut of his foot, may keep off the old from dread of the future!"</Q></P>
<P>Here a Turk, richly habited and re|&s;plendent with jewels, &s;talked towards Ce|cilia, and, having regarded her &s;ome time, called out <Q REND="inline">"I have been looking hard about me the whole evening, and, faith, I have &s;een nothing hand&s;ome before!"</Q></P>
<P>The moment he opened his mouth, his voice, to her utter a&s;toni&s;hment, betrayed Sir Robert Floyer! <Q REND="inline">"Mercy on me,"</Q> cried &s;he aloud, and pointing to the fiend, <Q REND="inline">"who, then, can this po&s;&s;ibly be?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you not know?"</Q> cried the white domino.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I thought I had known with certainty,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"but I now find I was mi&s;|taken."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="199">
<Q REND="inline">"He is a happy man,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;chool|ma&s;ter, &s;arca&s;tically looking at the Turk, <Q REND="inline">"who has removed your &s;u&s;picions only by appearing in another character!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why what the deuce, then,"</Q> exclaimed the Turk, <Q REND="inline">"have you taken that black dog there for <HI>me?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Before this que&s;tion could be an&s;wered, an offen&s;ive &s;mell of &s;oot, making every bo|dy look around the room, the chimney-&s;weeper already mentioned by Mi&s;s La|rolles, was perceived to enter it. Every way he moved, a pa&s;&s;age was cleared for him, as the company, with general di&s;gu&s;t, retreated wherever he advanced. He was &s;hort, and &s;eemed &s;omewhat incommoded by his dre&s;s; he held his &s;oot-bag over one arm, and his &s;hovel under the other. As &s;oon as he e&s;pied Cecilia, who&s;e &s;ituation was &s;uch as to prevent her eluding him, he hooted aloud, and came &s;tumping up to her; <Q REND="inline">"Ah ha,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"found at la&s;t;"</Q> then, throwing down his &s;hovel, he opened the mouth of his bag, and pointing wag|gi&s;hly to her head, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Come, &s;hall I pop you?&mdash;A good place for naughty girls; in, I &s;ay, poke in!&mdash;cram you up the chimney."</Q></P>
<P>And then he put forth his &s;ooty hands to reach her cap.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though &s;he in&s;tantly knew the
<PB N="200" REF="200">
dialect of her guardian Mr. Briggs, was not therefore the more willing to be &s;o handled, and &s;tarted back to &s;ave her&s;elf from his touch; the white domino al&s;o came forward, and &s;pread out his arms as a defence to her, while the Devil, who was &s;till before her, again began to growl.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah ha!"</Q> cried the chimney-&s;weeper, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o did not know me? Poor duck! won't hurt you; don't be frightened; nothing but old guardian; all a joke!"</Q> And then, patting her cheek with his dirty hand, and nodding at her with much kind|ne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"Pretty dove,"</Q> he added, <Q REND="inline">"be of good heart! &s;ha'n't be meddled with; come to &s;ee after you.

<P><Q REND="inline">"What do you mean, you dirty dog,"</Q> cried the Turk, <Q REND="inline">"by touching that lady?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Won't tell!"</Q> an&s;wered he; <Q REND="inline">"not your bu&s;ine&s;s. Got a good right. Who cares for pearls?

<PB N="201" REF="201">
Who's to pay the piper? Come to more than a guinea; warrant Ma&s;ter Harrel thinks that nothing!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A guinea?"</Q> contemptuou&s;ly repeated the Turk, <Q REND="inline">"and what do you &s;uppo&s;e a guinea will do?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What? Why keep a whole family hand&s;ome a week;&mdash;never &s;pend &s;o much my&s;elf; no, nor half neither."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why then how the devil do you live? Do you beg?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Beg? Who &s;hould beg of? You?&mdash;Got any thing to give? Are warm?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Take the trouble to &s;peak more re|&s;pectfully, &s;ir!"</Q> &s;aid the Turk, haughtily; <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee you are &s;ome low fellow, and I &s;hall not put up with your impudence."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Shall, &s;hall!

<P><Q REND="inline">"What do you mean by that, you little old &s;crub!"</Q> cried the imperious Turk; <Q REND="inline">"would you provoke me to &s;oil my fingers by pulling that bea&s;tly &s;nub no&s;e?"</Q> For
<PB N="202" REF="202">
Mr. Briggs had &s;aved him&s;elf any ac|tual ma&s;k, by merely blacking his face with &s;oot.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Bea&s;tly &s;nub no&s;e!"</Q> &s;puttered out the chimney-&s;weeper, in much wrath, <Q REND="inline">"good no&s;e enough; don't want a better; good as another man's. Where's the harm on't?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How could this black-guard get in?"</Q> Cried the Turk, <Q REND="inline">"I believe he's a mere common chimney-&s;weeper out of the &s;treets, for he's all over dirt and filth. I never &s;aw &s;uch a dre&s;s at a ma&s;querade be|fore in my life."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All the better,"</Q> returned the other; <Q REND="inline">"would not change. What do think it co&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Co&s;t? Why not a crown."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A crown? ha! ha!&mdash;a pot o'beer! Little Tom borrowed it; had it of our own &s;weep. Said 'twas for him&s;elf. I bid him a pint; ra&s;cal would not take le&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did your late uncle,"</Q> &s;aid the white domino, in a low voice to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"chu&s;e for two of your guardians, Mr. Harrel and Mr. Briggs, to give you an early le&s;&s;on up|on the oppo&s;ite errors of profu&s;ion and meanne&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My uncle?"</Q> cried Cecilia, &s;tarting, <Q REND="inline">"were you acquainted with my uncle?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"for my happine&s;s I knew him not."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="203">
<Q REND="inline">"You would have owed no lo&s;s of hap+pine&s;s to an acquaintance with him,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, very &s;eriou&s;ly, <Q REND="inline">"for he was one who di&s;pen&s;ed to his friends nothing but good."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps &s;o,"</Q> &s;aid the domino; <Q REND="inline">"but I fear I &s;hould have found the good he di&s;|pen&s;ed through his niece not quite un|mixed with evil!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What's here?"</Q> cried the chimney-&s;weeper, &s;tumbling over the fiend, <Q REND="inline">"what's this black thing? Don't like it; looks like the devil. You &s;ha'n't &s;tay with it; carry you away; take care of you my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>He then offered Cecilia his hand; but the black gentleman, rai&s;ing him&s;elf upon his knees before her, paid her, in dumb &s;hew, the humble&s;t devoirs, yet prevented her from removing.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah ha!"</Q> cried the chimney-&s;weeper, &s;ignificantly nodding his head, <Q REND="inline">"&s;mell a rat! a &s;weet-heart in di&s;gui&s;e.

That's the point; are warm?"</Q></P>
<P>The fiend, without returning any an&s;wer, continued his homage to Cecilia; at which the enraged chimney-&s;weeper exclaimed
<PB N="204" REF="204">
<Q REND="inline">"Come, come with me! won't be impo&s;ed upon; an old fox,&mdash;under&s;tand trap!"</Q></P>
<P>He then again held out his hand, but Cecilia, pointing to the fiend, an&s;wered <Q REND="inline">"How can I come, &s;ir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Shew you the way,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hovel him off."</Q> And taking his &s;hovel, he very roughly &s;et about removing him.</P>
<P>The fiend then began a yell &s;o horrid, that it di&s;turbed the whole company; but the chimney-&s;weeper, only &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"Aye, aye, blacky, growl away blacky,&mdash;makes no odds,&mdash;"</Q> &s;turdily continued his work, and, as the fiend had no chance of re&s;i&s;ting &s;o coar&s;e an antagoni&s;t without a &s;erious &s;truggle, he was pre&s;ently compelled to change his ground.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Warm work!"</Q> cried the victorious chimney &s;weeper, taking off his wig, and wiping his head with the &s;leeves of his dre&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"pure warm work this!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, once again freed from her per&s;e|cutor, in&s;tantly quitted her place, almo&s;t equally de&s;irous to e&s;cape the haughty Turk, who was peculiarly her aver&s;ion, and the facetious chimney-&s;weeper, who&s;e vi|cinity, either on account of his dre&s;s or his conver&s;ation, was by no means de&s;irable. She was not, however, di&s;plea&s;ed that the white domino and the &s;chool-ma&s;ter &s;till continued to attend her.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"The rea&s;on, however,"</Q> an&s;wered the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"is obvious; that light and beautiful &s;ilver anchor upon which &s;he re|clines, pre&s;ents an occa&s;ion irre&s;i&s;tible for an attitude of elegant dejection; and the a&s;&s;umed character is always given up, where an opportunity offers to di&s;play any beauty, or manife&s;t any perfection in the dear proper per&s;on!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But why,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hould &s;he a&s;&s;ume the character of <HI>Hope?</HI> Could &s;he not have been equally dejected, and equally elegant as Niobe, or &s;ome tragedy queen?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But &s;he does not a&s;&s;ume the character,"</Q> an&s;wered the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he does not even think of it: the dre&s;s is her object, and that alone fills up all her ideas. En|quire of almo&s;t any body in the room con|cerning the per&s;ons they &s;eem to repre&s;ent, and you will find their ignorance more gro&s;s than you can imagine; they have not once thought upon the &s;ubject; accident, or convenience, or caprice has alone directed their choice."</Q></P>
<P>A tall and elegant youth now approached them, who&s;e laurels and harp announced Apollo. The white domino immediately
<PB N="206" REF="206">
enquired of him if the noi&s;e and turbulence of the company, had any chance of being &s;tilled into &s;ilence and rapture, by the di|vine mu&s;ic of the in&s;pired god?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> an&s;wered he, pointing to the room in which was erected the new gallery, and whence, as he &s;poke, i&s;&s;ued the &s;ound of an <HI>hautboy,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"there is a flute playing there already."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O for a Midas,"</Q> cried the white do|mino, <Q REND="inline">"to return to this leather-eared god the di&s;grace he received from him!"</Q></P>
<P>They now proceeded to the apartment which had been lately fitted up for refre&s;h|ments, and which was &s;o full of com|pany, that they entered it with difficulty. And here they were again joined by Miner|va, who, taking Cecilia's hand, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Lord how glad I am you've got away from that frightful black ma&s;k! I can't conceive who he is; nobody can find out; it's mon&s;trous odd, but he has not &s;poke a word all night, and he makes &s;uch a &s;hocking noi&s;e when people touch him, that I a&s;&s;ure you it's enough to put one in a fright."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And pray,"</Q> cried the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, di&s;gui&s;ing his voice, <Q REND="inline">"how came&s;t thou to take the helmet of Minerva for a fool's cap?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, I have not,"</Q> cried &s;he, inno|cently,
<PB N="207" REF="207">
<Q REND="inline">"why the whole dre&s;s is Minerva's; don't you &s;ee?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear child,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"thou could&s;t as well with that little figure pa&s;s for a Goliah, as with that little wit for a Pallas."</Q></P>
<P>Their attention was now drawn from the godde&s;s of wi&s;dom to a mad Edgar, who &s;o vehemently ran about the room calling out <Q REND="inline">"Poor Tom's a cold!"</Q> that, in a &s;hort time, he was obliged to take off his ma&s;k, from an effect, not very delicate, of the heat!</P>
<P>Soon after, a gentleman de&s;iring &s;ome lemonade who&s;e toga &s;poke the con&s;ular dignity, though his broken Engli&s;h be|trayed a native of France, the &s;chool-ma&s;|ter followed him, and, with reverence the mo&s;t profound began to addre&s;s him in Latin; but, turning quick towards him, he gayly &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Mon&s;ieur, j'ai l'honneur de re|pre&s;enter Ciceron, le grand Ciceron, pere de &s;a patrie! mais quoique j'ai cet honneur l&aacute;, je ne &s;uis pas pedant!&mdash;mon dieu, Mon&s;ieur, je ne parle que le Fran&ccedil;ois dans la bonne com|pagnie!</HI>"</Q> And, politely bowing, he went on.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then Cecilia, while looking about the room for Mrs. Harrel, felt her&s;elf &s;ud|denly pinched by the cheek, and ha&s;tily turning round, perceived again her friend the chimeny-&s;weeper, who, laughing, cried
<PB N="208" REF="208">
<Q REND="inline">"Only me! don't be frightened. Have &s;omething to tell you;&mdash;had no luck!&mdash;got never a hu&s;band yet! can't find one! looked all over, too; &s;harp as a needle. Not one to be had! all catched up!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am glad to hear it, &s;ir,"</Q> &s;aid Ceci|cia, &s;omewhat vexed by ob&s;erving the white domino attentively li&s;tening; <Q REND="inline">"and I hope, therefore, you will give your&s;elf no farther trouble."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pretty duck!"</Q> cried he, chucking her under the chin; <Q REND="inline">"never mind, don't be ca&s;t down; get one at la&s;t. Leave it to me. Nothing under a plum; won't take up with le&s;s. Good by, ducky, good by! mu&s;t go home now,&mdash;begin to be nodding."</Q></P>
<P>And then, repeating his kind care&s;&s;es, he walked away.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you think, then,"</Q> &s;aid the white domino, <Q REND="inline">"more highly of Mr. Briggs for di&s;cernment and ta&s;te than of any body?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope not!"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"for low indeed &s;hould I then think of the re&s;t of the world!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The commi&s;&s;ion with which he is charged,"</Q> returned the domino, <Q REND="inline">"has then mi&s;led me; I imagined di&s;cernment and ta&s;te might be nece&s;&s;ary ingredients for making &s;uch a choice as your approbation would &s;anctify; but perhaps his &s;kill in guarding again&s;t any fraud or deduction in
<PB N="209" REF="209">
the &s;tipulation he mentioned, may be all that is requi&s;ite for the execution of his tru&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I under&s;tand very well,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, a little hurt, <Q REND="inline">"the &s;everity of your mean|ing; and if Mr. Briggs had any commi&s;|&s;ion but of his own &s;ugge&s;tion, it would fill me with &s;hame and confu&s;ion; but as that is not the ca&s;e, tho&s;e at lea&s;t are &s;en&s;ations which it cannot give me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My meaning,"</Q> cried the domino, with &s;ome earne&s;tne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hould I expre&s;s it &s;eri|ou&s;ly, would but prove to you the re&s;pect and admiration with which you have in&s;pired me, and if indeed, as Mr. Briggs hinted, &s;uch a prize is to be purcha&s;ed by riches, I know not, from what I have &s;een of its merit, any &s;um I &s;hould think ade|quate to its value."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are determined, I &s;ee,"</Q> &s;aid Ce|cilia, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"to make mo&s;t liberal amends for your a&s;perity."</Q></P>
<P>A loud clack of tongues now interrupted their di&s;cour&s;e; and the domino, at the de|&s;ire of Cecilia, for whom he had procured a &s;eat, went forward to enquire what was the matter. But &s;carce had he given up his place a moment, before, to her great mor|tification, it was occupied by the fiend.</P>
<P>Again, but with the &s;ame determined &s;i|lence he had hitherto pre&s;erved, he made
<PB N="210" REF="210">
&s;igns of obedience and homage, and her perplexity to conjecture who he could be, or what were his motives for this per&s;ecu|tion, became the more urgent as they &s;eemed the le&s;s likely to be &s;atisfied. But the fiend, who was no other than Mr. Monckton, had every in&s;tant le&s;s and le&s;s encouragement to make him&s;elf known: his plan had in no|thing &s;ucceeded, and his provocation at its failure had cau&s;ed him the bittere&s;t di&s;ap|pointment; he had intended, in the cha|racter of a tormentor, not only to pur&s;ue and hover around her him&s;elf, but he had al&s;o hoped, in the &s;ame character, to have kept at a di&s;tance all other admirers: but the violence with which he had over-acted his part, by rai&s;ing her di&s;gu&s;t and the indignation of the company, rendered his views wholly abortive: while the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of an extravagance for which, if di&s;|covered, he could a&s;&s;ign no rea&s;on not li|able to excite &s;u&s;picions of his &s;ecret mo|tives, reduced him to guarding a painful and mo&s;t irk&s;ome &s;ilence the whole evening. And Cecilia, to who&s;e un&s;u&s;picious mind the idea of Mr. Monckton had never oc|curred, added continually to the cruelty of his &s;ituation, by an undi&s;gui&s;ed abhor|rence of his a&s;&s;iduity, as well as by a mani|fe&s;t preference to the attendance of the white domino. All, therefore, that his di&s;ap|pointed
<PB N="211" REF="211">
&s;cheme now left in his power, was to watch her motions, li&s;ten to her di&s;|cour&s;e, and inflict occa&s;ionally upon others &s;ome part of the chagrin with which he was tormented him&s;elf.</P>
<P>While they were in this &s;ituation, Harle|quin, in con&s;equence of being ridiculed by the Turk for want of agility, offered to jump over the new de&s;ert table, and de&s;ired to have a little &s;pace cleared to give room for his motions. It was in vain the peo|ple who di&s;tributed the refre&s;hments, and who were placed at the other &s;ide of the table, expo&s;tulated upon the danger of the experiment; Morrice had a rage of enter|prize untameable, and therefore, fir&s;t tak|ing a run, he attempted the leap.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence was &s;uch as might na|turally be expected; he could not accom|pli&s;h his purpo&s;e, but, finding him&s;elf fal|ling, imprudently caught hold of the lately erected Awning, and pulled it entirely up|on his own head, and with it the new con|trived lights, which in various forms were fixed to it, and which all came down to|gether.</P>
<P>The mi&s;chief and confu&s;ion occa&s;ioned by this exploit were very alarming, and al|mo&s;t dangerous; tho&s;e who were near the table &s;uffered mo&s;t by the cru&s;h, but &s;plin|ters of the gla&s;s flew yet further; and as
<PB N="212" REF="212">
the room, which was &s;mall, had been only lighted up by lamps hanging from the Awning, it was now in total darkne&s;s, ex|cept clo&s;e to the door, which was &s;till illu|minated from the adjoining apartments.</P>
<P>The clamour of Harlequin, who was co|vered with gla&s;s, papier mach&eacute;e, lamps and oil, the &s;creams of the ladies, the univer|&s;al buz of tongues, and the &s;truggle be|tween the frighted crowd which was en|clo&s;ed to get out, and the curious crowd from the other apartments to get in, occa|&s;ioned a di&s;turbance and tumult equally noi&s;y and confu&s;ed. But the mo&s;t &s;erious &s;ufferer was the unfortunate fiend, who be|ing nearer the table than Cecilia, was &s;o pre&s;&s;ed upon by the numbers which poured from it, that he found a &s;eparation unavoid|able, and was unable, from the darkne&s;s and the throng, to di&s;cover whether &s;he was &s;till in the &s;ame place, or had made her e&s;|cape into another.</P>
<P>She had, however, encountered the white domino; and, under his protection, was &s;afely conveyed to a further part of the room. Her intention and de&s;ire were to quit it immediately, but at the remon|&s;trance of her conductor, &s;he con&s;ented to remain &s;ome time longer. <Q REND="inline">"The conflict at the door,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"will quite over|power you. Stay here but a few minutes,
<PB N="213" REF="213">
and both parties will have &s;truggled them&s;elves tired, and you may then go without difficulty. Mean time, can you not by this faint light, &s;uppo&s;e me one of your guardians, Mr. Briggs, for example, or, if he is too old for me, Mr. Harrel, and entru&s;t your&s;elf to my care?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;eem wonderfully well acquainted with my guardians,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"I can|not imagine how you have had your intel|ligence."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nor can I,"</Q> an&s;wered the domino, <Q REND="inline">"imagine how Mr. Briggs became &s;o par|ticularly your favourite as to be entru&s;ted with powers to di&s;po&s;e of you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are mi&s;taken indeed; he is en|tru&s;ted with no powers but &s;uch as his own fancy has &s;ugge&s;ted."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But how has Mr. Delvile offended you, that with him only you &s;eem to have no commerce or communication?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Delvile!"</Q> repeated Cecilia, &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"are you al&s;o acquainted with Mr. Delvile?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is certainly a man of fa&s;hion,"</Q> continued the domino, <Q REND="inline">"and he is al&s;o a man of honour; &s;urely, then, he would be more plea&s;ant for confidence and con&s;ulta|tion, than one who&s;e only notion of happi|ne&s;s is money, who&s;e only idea of excel|lence
<PB N="214" REF="214">
is avarice, and who&s;e only conception of &s;en&s;e is di&s;tru&s;t!"</Q></P>
<P>Here a violent outcry again interrupted their conver&s;ation; but not till Cecilia had &s;atisfied her doubts concerning the white domino, by conjecturing he was Mr. Bel|field, who might ea&s;ily at the hou&s;e of Mr. Monckton have gathered the little circum|&s;tances of her &s;ituation to which he alluded, and who&s;e &s;ize and figure exactly re&s;embled tho&s;e of her new acquaintance.</P>
<P>The author of the former di&s;turbance was now the occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent: the fiend, having vainly traver&s;ed the room in &s;earch of Cecilia, &s;tumbled accidentally up|on Harlequin, before he was freed from the relicks of his own mi&s;chief; and unable to re&s;i&s;t the temptation of opportunity, and the impul&s;e of revenge, he gave vent to the wrath &s;o often excited by the blunders, forwardne&s;s, and tricks of Morrice, and in|flicted upon him, with his own wooden &s;word, which he &s;eized for that purpo&s;e, a cha&s;ti&s;e|ment the mo&s;t &s;erious and &s;evere.</P>
<P>Poor Harlequin, unable to imagine any rea&s;on for this violent attack, and already cut with the gla&s;s,, and brui&s;ed with the fall, &s;pared not his lungs in making known his di&s;approbation of &s;uch treatment: but the fiend, regardle&s;s either of his complaints or his re&s;i&s;tance, forbore not to belabour
<PB N="215" REF="215">
him till compelled by the entrance of peo|ple with lights. And then, after artfully playing &s;undry anticks under pretence of &s;till &s;upporting his character, with a motion too &s;udden for prevention, and too rapid for pur&s;uit, he e&s;caped out of the room, and hurrying down &s;tairs, threw him&s;elf in|to an hackney chair, which conveyed him to a place where he privately changed his dre&s;s before he returned home: bitterly re|penting the experiment he had made, and con&s;cious too late that had he appeared in a character he might have avowed, he could, without impropriety, have attended Cecilia the whole evening. But &s;uch is de&s;ervedly the frequent fate of cunning, which while it plots &s;urpri&s;e and detection of others, commonly over&s;hoots its mark, and ends in its own di&s;grace.</P>
<P>The introduction of the lights now mak|ing manife&s;t the confu&s;ion which the frolic of Harlequin had occa&s;ioned, he was &s;eized with &s;uch a dread of the re&s;entment of Mr. Harrel, that, forgetting blows, brui&s;es and wounds, not one of which were &s;o frightful to him as reproof, he made the la&s;t exhibi|tion of his agility by an abrupt and ha&s;ty retreat.</P>
<P>He had, however, no rea&s;on for appre|hen&s;ion, &s;ince in every thing that regarded
<PB N="216" REF="216">
expence, Mr. Harrel had no feeling, and his lady had no thought.</P>
<P>The rooms now began to empty very fa&s;t, but among the few ma&s;ks yet remain|ing, Cecilia again perceived Don Quixote; and while, in conjunction with the white do|mino, &s;he was allowing him the prai&s;e of having &s;upported his character with more uniform propriety than any other per&s;on in the a&s;&s;embly, &s;he ob&s;erved him taking off his ma&s;k for the convenience of drinking &s;ome lemonade, and, looking in his face, found he was no other than Mr. Belfield! Much a&s;toni&s;hed, and more than ever per|plexed, &s;he again turned to the white do|mino, who &s;eeing in her countenance a &s;urpri&s;e of which he knew not the rea&s;on, &s;aid, half laughing, <Q REND="inline">"You think, perhaps, I &s;hall never be gone? And indeed I am almo&s;t of the &s;ame opinion: but what can I do? In|&s;tead of growing weary by the length of my &s;tay, my reluctance to &s;horten it encrea&s;es with its duration: and all the methods I take, whether by &s;peaking to you or looking at you, with a view to be &s;atiated, only double my eagerne&s;s for looking and li&s;ten|ing again! I mu&s;t go, however; and if I am happy, I may perhaps meet with you again,&mdash;though, if I am wi&s;e, I &s;hall never &s;eek you more!"</Q></P>
<P>And then, with the la&s;t &s;tragglers that
<PB N="217" REF="217">
reluctantly di&s;appeared, he made his exit; leaving Cecilia greatly plea&s;ed with his con|ver&s;ation and his manners, but extremely perplexed to account for his knowledge of her affairs and &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The &s;chool-ma&s;ter had already been gone &s;ome time.</P>
<P>She was now earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed by the Har|rels and Sir Robert, who &s;till remained, to &s;end to a warehou&s;e for a dre&s;s, and accom|pany them to the Pantheon; but though &s;he was not without &s;ome inclination to comply, in the hope of further prolonging the entertainment of an evening from which &s;he had received much plea&s;ure, &s;he di&s;liked the attendance of the Baronet, and felt aver&s;e to grant any reque&s;t that he could make, and therefore &s;he begged they would excu&s;e her; and having waited to &s;ee their dre&s;&s;es, which were very &s;uperb, &s;he retired to her own apartment.</P>
<P>A great variety of conjecture upon all that had pa&s;&s;ed, now, and till the moment that &s;he &s;unk to re&s;t, occupied her mind; the ex|traordinary per&s;ecution of the fiend excited at once her curio&s;ity and amazement, while the knowledge of her affairs &s;hewn by the white domino, &s;urpri&s;ed her not le&s;s, and intere&s;ted her more.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. AN AFFRAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning during breakfa&s;t, Cecilia was informed that a gentleman de&s;ired to &s;peak with her. She begged permi&s;&s;ion of Mrs. Harrel to have him a&s;ked up &s;tairs, and was not a little &s;ur|prized when he proved to be the &s;ame old gentleman who&s;e &s;ingular exclamations had &s;o much &s;truck her at Mr. Monckton's, and at the rehear&s;al of Arta&s;er&s;e.</P>
<P>Abruptly and with a &s;tern a&s;pect advanc|ing to her, <Q REND="inline">"You are rich,"</Q> he cried; <Q REND="inline">"are you therefore worthle&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope not!"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, in &s;ome con&s;ternation; while Mrs. Harrel, believ|ing his intention was to rob them, ran pre|cipitately to the bell, which &s;he rang with|out cea&s;ing till two or three &s;ervants ha&s;|tened into the room: by which time, being le&s;s alarmed, &s;he only made &s;igns to them to &s;tay, and &s;tood quietly her&s;elf to wait what would follow.</P>
<P>The old man, without attending to her, continued his dialogue with Cecilia.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="219">
<Q REND="inline">"Know you then,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"a blame|le&s;s u&s;e of riches? &s;uch a u&s;e as not only in the broad glare of day &s;hall &s;hine re&s;plen|dent, but in the darkne&s;s of midnight, and &s;tillne&s;s of repo&s;e, &s;hall give you reflections unimbittered, and &s;lumbers unbroken? tell me, know you this u&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not &s;o well, perhaps,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"as I ought; but I am very willing to learn better."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Begin, then, while yet youth and inexpe|rience, new to the callou&s;ne&s;s of power and affluence, leave &s;omething good to work upon: ye&s;terday you &s;aw the extravagance of luxury and folly; to day look deeper, and &s;ee, and learn to pity, the mi&s;ery of di&s;ea&s;e and penury."</Q></P>
<P>He then put into her hand a paper which contained a mo&s;t affecting account of the mi&s;ery to which a poor and wretched fa|mily had been reduced, by &s;ickne&s;s, and various other misfortunes.</P>
<P>Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"open as day to melting cha|rity,"</Q> having ha&s;tily peru&s;ed it, took out her pur&s;e, and offering to him three guineas, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t direct me, Sir, what to give if this is in&s;ufficient."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ha&s;t thou &s;o much heart?"</Q> cried he, with emotion, <Q REND="inline">"and has fortune, though it has cur&s;ed thee with the temptation of pro&s;perity, not yet rooted from thy mind
<PB N="220" REF="220">
its native benevolence? I return in part thy liberal contribution; this,"</Q> taking one guinea, <Q REND="inline">"doubles my expectations; I will not, by making thy charity di&s;tre&s;s thee, accelerate the fatal hour of hardne&s;s and degeneracy."</Q></P>
<P>He was then going; but Cecilia, follow|ing him, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"No, take it all! Who &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t the poor if I will not? Rich, without connections; powerful, without wants; upon whom have they any claim if not upon me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True,"</Q> cried he, receiving the re&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"and wi&s;e as true. Give, therefore, whil&s;t yet thou ha&s;t the heart to give, and make, in thy days of innocence and kind|ne&s;s, &s;ome intere&s;t with Heaven and the poor!"</Q></P>
<P>And then he di&s;appeared.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, my dear,"</Q> cried Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"what could induce you to give the man &s;o much money? Don't you &s;ee he is crazy? I dare &s;ay he would have been ju&s;t as well contented with &s;ixpence."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know not what he is,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"but his manners are not more &s;ingular than his &s;entiments are affecting; and if he is actuated by charity to rai&s;e &s;ub&s;criptions for the indigent, he can &s;urely apply to no one who ought &s;o readily to contribute as my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="221">
Mr. Harrel then came in, and his lady mo&s;t eagerly told him the tran&s;action.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Thus it is,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, half &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"that we can all lecture one another! to|day you recommend oeconomy to me; ye&s;|terday I with difficulty forbore recommend|ing it to you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nay"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"that was quite another matter; expence incurred in the common way of a man's living is quite another thing to an extortion of this &s;ort."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is another thing indeed,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"but I know not that it is therefore a better."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Harrel made no an&s;wer: and Ce|cilia, privately moralizing upon the diffe|rent e&s;timates of expence and oeconomy made by the di&s;&s;ipated and the charitable, &s;oon retired to her own apartment, deter|mined firmly to adhere to her lately adopted plan, and hoping, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her new and very &s;ingular monitor, to extend
<PB N="222" REF="222">
her practice of doing good, by enlarging her knowledge of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Objects are, however, never wanting for the exerci&s;e of benevolence; report &s;oon publi&s;hed her liberality, and tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to believe it, failed not to enquire into its truth. She was &s;oon at the head of a little band of pen&s;ioners, and, never &s;atisfied with the genero&s;ity of her dona|tions, found in a very &s;hort time, that the common allowance of her guardians was &s;carce adequate to the calls of her munifi|cence.</P>
<P>And thus, in acts of goodne&s;s and cha|rity, pa&s;&s;ed undi&s;turbed another week of the life of Cecilia: but when the fervour of &s;elf-approbation lo&s;t its novelty, the plea&s;ure with which her new plan was be|gun fir&s;t &s;ub&s;ided into tranquility, and then &s;unk into languor. To a heart formed for friend&s;hip and affection the charms of &s;olitude are very &s;hort-lived; and though &s;he had &s;ickened of the turbulence of per|petual company, &s;he now wearied of pa&s;|&s;ing all her time by her&s;elf, and &s;ighed for the comfort of &s;ociety, and the relief of communication. But &s;he &s;aw with a&s;toni&s;h|ment the difficulty with which this was to be obtained: the endle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of diver&s;ions, the continual rotation of a&s;&s;em|blies, the numerou&s;ne&s;s of &s;plendid engage|ments, of which while every one com|plained,
<PB N="223" REF="223">
every one was proud to boa&s;t, &s;o effectually impeded private meetings and friendly intercour&s;e, that, which ever way &s;he turned her&s;elf, all commerce &s;eemed impracticable, but &s;uch as either led to di&s;&s;ipation, or accidentally flowed from it.</P>
<P>Yet finding the error into which her ar|dour of reformation had hurried her, and that a rigid &s;eclu&s;ion from company was productive of a la&s;&s;itude as little favourable to active virtue as di&s;&s;ipation it&s;elf, &s;he re|&s;olved to &s;often her plan, and by mingling amu&s;ement with benevolence, to try, at lea&s;t, to approach that golden mean, which, like the philo&s;opher's &s;tone, always eludes our gra&s;p, yet always invites our wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e &s;he de&s;ired to attend Mrs. Harrel to the next Opera that &s;hould be repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>The following Saturday, therefore, &s;he accompanied that lady and Mrs. Mears to the Haymarket, e&s;corted by Mr. Arnott.</P>
<P>They were very late; the Opera was be|gun, and even in the lobby the crowd was &s;o great that their pa&s;&s;age was ob&s;tructed. Here they were pre&s;ently acco&s;ted by Mi&s;s Larolles, who, running up to Cecilia and taking her hand, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Lord, you can't conceive how glad I am to &s;ee you! why, my dear creature, where have you hid your|&s;elf the&s;e twenty ages? You are quite in
<PB N="224" REF="224">
luck in coming to-night, I a&s;&s;ure you; it's the be&s;t Opera we have had this &s;ea&s;on: there's &s;uch a mon&s;trous crowd there's no &s;tirring. We &s;ha'n't get in this half hour. The coffee-room is quite full; only come and &s;ee; is it not delightful?"</Q></P>
<P>This intimation was &s;ufficient for Mrs. Harrel, who&s;e love of the Opera was merely a love of company, fa&s;hion, and &s;hew; and therefore to the coffee-room &s;he readily led the way.</P>
<P>And here Cecilia found rather the ap|pearance of a brilliant a&s;&s;embly of ladies and gentlemen, collected merely to &s;ee and to entertain one another, than of di&s;tinct and ca&s;ual parties, mixing &s;olely from ne|ce&s;&s;ity, and waiting only for room to enter a theatre.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on that addre&s;&s;ed them was Captain Are&s;by, who, with his u&s;ual deli|cate langui&s;hment, &s;miled upon Cecilia, and &s;oftly whi&s;pering, <Q REND="inline">"How divinely you look to night!"</Q> proceeded to pay his compli|ments to &s;ome other ladies.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do pray now,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"ob&s;erve Mr. Meadows! only ju&s;t &s;ee where he has fixed him&s;elf! in the very be&s;t place in the room, and keeping the fire from every body! I do a&s;&s;ure you that's always his way, and it's mon&s;trous pro|voking, for if one's ever &s;o cold, he lollops
<PB N="225" REF="225">
&s;o, that one's quite &s;tarved. But you mu&s;t know there's another thing he does that is quite as bad, for if he gets a &s;eat, he never offers to move, if he &s;ees one &s;inking with fatigue. And be&s;ides, if one is waiting for one's carriage two hours together, he makes it a rule never to &s;tir a &s;tep to &s;ee for it. Only think how mon&s;trous!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The&s;e are heavy complaints, indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, looking at him attentively; <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould have expected from his appear|ance a very different account of his gal|lantry, for he &s;eems dre&s;&s;ed with more &s;tu|died elegance than any body here."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O yes,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Larolles, <Q REND="inline">"he is the &s;weete&s;t dre&s;&s;er in the world; he has the mo&s;t delightful ta&s;te you can conceive, nobody has half &s;o good a fancy. I a&s;&s;ure you it's a great thing to be &s;poke to by him: we are all of us quite angry when he won't take any notice of us."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is your anger,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, laugh|ing, <Q REND="inline">"in honour of him&s;elf or of his coat?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, Lord, don't you know all this time that he is an <HI>ennuy&eacute;?</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know, at lea&s;t,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that he would &s;oon make one of me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O but one is never affronted with an <HI>ennuy&eacute;,</HI> if he is ever &s;o provoking, becau&s;e one always knows what it means."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="226">
<Q REND="inline">"Is he agreeable?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why, to tell you the truth,&mdash;but pray now don't mention it,&mdash;I think him mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive di&s;agreeable! He yawns in one's face every time one looks at him. I a&s;&s;ure you &s;ometimes I expect to &s;ee him fall fa&s;t a&s;leep while I am talking to him, for he is &s;o immen&s;ely ab&s;ent he don't hear one half that one &s;ays; only conceive how horrid!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But why, then, do you encourage him? why do you take any notice of him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, every body does, I a&s;&s;ure you, el&s;e I would not for the world; but he is &s;o courted you have no idea. However, of all things let me advi&s;e you never to dance with him; I did once my&s;elf, and I declare I was quite di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to death the whole time, for he was taken with &s;uch a fit of ab&s;ence he knew nothing he was about, &s;ometimes &s;kipping and jumping with all the violence in the world, ju&s;t as if he only danced for exerci&s;e, and &s;ometimes &s;tand|ing quite &s;till, or lolling again&s;t the wain&s;|coat and gaping, and taking no more no|tice of me than if he had never &s;een me in his life!"</Q></P>
<P>The captain now, again advancing to Cecilia, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"So you would not do us the honour to try the ma&s;querade at the Pantheon? however, I hear you had a very
<PB N="227" REF="227">
brilliant &s;pectacle at Mr. Harrel's. I was quite <HI>au de&s;e&s;poir</HI> that I could not get there. I did <HI>mon po&s;&s;ible,</HI> but it was quite beyond me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We &s;hould have been very happy,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"to have &s;een you; I a&s;&s;ure you we had &s;ome excellent ma&s;ks."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So I have heard <HI>partout,</HI> and I am re|duced to de&s;pair that I could not have the honour of &s;liding in. But I was <HI>accabl&eacute;</HI> with affairs all day. Nothing could be &s;o mortifying."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now, growing very impatient to hear the Opera, begged to know if they might not make a trial to get into the pit?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I fear,"</Q> &s;aid the captain, &s;miling as they pa&s;&s;ed him, without offering any a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, <Q REND="inline">"you will find it extreme petrifying; for my part, I confe&s;s I am not upon the principle of crowding."</Q></P>
<P>The ladies, however, accompanied by Mr. Arnott, made the attempt, and &s;oon found, according to the cu&s;tom of report, that the difficulty, for the plea&s;ure of talk|ing of it, had been con&s;iderably exagge|rated. They were &s;eparated, indeed, but their accommodation was tolerably good.</P>
<P>Cecilia was much vexed to find the fir&s;t act of the Opera almo&s;t over; but &s;he was &s;oon &s;till more di&s;&s;atisfied when &s;he di&s;co|vered
<PB N="228" REF="228">
that &s;he had no chance of hearing the little which remained: the place &s;he had happened to find vacant was next to a party of young ladies, who were &s;o earne&s;tly engaged in their own di&s;cour&s;e, that they li&s;tened not to a note of the Opera, and &s;o infinitely diverted with their own witti|ci&s;ms, that their tittering and loquacity al|lowed no one in their vicinity to hear bet|ter than them&s;elves. Cecilia tried in vain to confine her attention to the &s;ingers, &s;he was di&s;tant from the &s;tage, and to them &s;he was near, and her fruitle&s;s attempts all ended in chagrin and impatience.</P>
<P>At length &s;he re&s;olved to make an effort for entertainment in another way, and &s;ince the expectations which brought her to the Opera were de&s;troyed, to try by li&s;tening to her fair neighbours, whether tho&s;e who occa&s;ioned her di&s;appointment, could make her any amends.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e &s;he turned to them wholly; yet was at fir&s;t in no little per|plexity to under&s;tand what was going for|ward, &s;ince &s;o univer&s;al was the eagerne&s;s for talking, and &s;o in&s;urmountable the an|tipathy to li&s;tening, that every one &s;eemed to have her wi&s;hes bounded by a continual utterance of words, without waiting for any an&s;wer, or &s;carce even de&s;iring to be heard.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="229">
But when, &s;omewhat more u&s;ed to their dialect and manner, &s;he began better to comprehend their di&s;cour&s;e, wretchedly in|deed did it &s;upply to her the lo&s;s of the Opera. She heard nothing but de&s;crip|tions of trimmings, and complaints of hair-dre&s;&s;ers, hints of conque&s;t that teemed with vanity, and hi&s;tories of engagements which were inflated with exultation,</P>
<P>At the end of the act, by the crowding forward of the gentlemen to &s;ee the dance, Mrs. Harrel had an opportunity of mak|ing room for her by her&s;elf, and &s;he had then &s;ome rea&s;on to expect hearing the re&s;t of the Opera in peace, for the company before her, con&s;i&s;ting entirely of young men, &s;eemed, even during the dance, fear|ful of &s;peaking, le&s;t their attention &s;hould be drawn for a moment from the &s;tage.</P>
<P>But to her infinite &s;urprize, no &s;ooner was the &s;econd act begun, than their attention ended! they turned from the performers to each other, and entered into a whi&s;pering, but gay conver&s;ation, which though not loud enough to di&s;turb the audience in general, kept in the ears of their neigh|bours, a buzzing which interrupted all plea&s;ure from the repre&s;entation. Of this effect of their gaiety it &s;eemed uncertain whether they were con&s;cious, but very evi|dent that they were totally carele&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="230">
The de&s;perate re&s;ource which &s;he had tried during the fir&s;t act, of &s;eeking enter|tainment from the very conver&s;ation which prevented her enjoying it, was not now even in her power: for the&s;e gentlemen, though as negligent as the young ladies had been whom they di&s;turbed, were much more cautious whom they in&s;tructed: their language was ambiguous, and their terms, to Cecilia, were unintelligible: their &s;ub|jects, indeed, required &s;ome di&s;cretion, be|ing nothing le&s;s than a ludicrous calcula|tion of the age and duration of jointured widows, and of the chances and expecta|tions of unmarried young ladies.</P>
<P>But what more even than their talking provoked her, was finding that the mo|ment the act was over, when &s;he cared not if their vociferation had been ince&s;&s;ant, one of them called out, <Q REND="inline">"Come, be quiet, the dance is begun;"</Q> and then they were again all &s;ilent attention!</P>
<P>In the third act, however, &s;he was more fortunate; the gentlemen again changed their places, and they were &s;ucceeded by others who came to the Opera not to hear them&s;elves but the performers: and as &s;oon as &s;he was permitted to li&s;ten, the voice of Pacchierotti took from her all de&s;ire to hear any thing but it&s;elf.</P>
<P>During the la&s;t dance &s;he was di&s;covered
<PB N="231" REF="231">
by Sir Robert Floyer, who &s;auntering down fop's alley, &s;tationed him&s;elf by her &s;ide, and whenever the <HI>figurante</HI> relieved the principal dancers, turned his eyes from the &s;tage to her face, as better worth his no|tice, and equally de&s;tined for his amu&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton too, who for &s;ome time had &s;een and watched her, now approached; he had ob&s;erved with much &s;atisfaction that her whole mind had been intent upon the performance, yet &s;till the familiarity of Sir Robert Floyer's admiration di&s;turbed and perplexed him; he determined, there|fore, to make an effort to &s;atisfy his doubts by examining into his intentions: and, taking him apart, before the dance was quite over, <Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"who is &s;o hand&s;ome here as Harrel's ward?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> an&s;wered he, calmly, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he is hand&s;ome, but I don't like her expre&s;&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No? why, what is the fault of it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Proud, cur&s;ed proud. It is not the &s;ort of woman I like. If one &s;ays a civil thing to her, &s;he only wi&s;hes one at the devil for one's pains."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, you have tried her, then, have you? why you are not, in general, much given to &s;ay civil things."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, you know I &s;aid &s;omething of that &s;ort to her once about Juliet, at the rehear&s;al. Was not you by?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="232">
<Q REND="inline">"What, then, was that all? and did you imagine one compliment would do your bu&s;ine&s;s with her?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, hang it, who ever dreams of com|plimenting the women now? that's all at an end."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You won't find &s;he thinks &s;o, though; for, as you well &s;ay, her pride is in&s;uffer|able, and I, who have long known her, can a&s;&s;ure you it does not dimini&s;h upon intimacy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps not,&mdash;but there's very pretty picking in 3000<HI>l.</HI> per annum! one would not think much of a little incumbrance upon &s;uch an e&s;tate."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are you quite &s;ure the e&s;tate is &s;o con&s;iderable? Report is mightily given to magnify."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, I have pretty good intelligence: though, after all, I don't know but I may be off; &s;he'll take a confounded deal of time and trouble."</Q></P>
<P>Monckton, too much a man of intere&s;t and of the world to cheri&s;h that delicacy which covets univer&s;al admiration for the object of it's fondne&s;s, then artfully en|larged upon the ob&s;tacles he already ap|prehended, and in&s;inuated &s;uch others as he believed would be mo&s;t likely to inti|midate him. But his &s;ubtlety was lo&s;t upon the impenetrable Baronet, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="233" REF="233">
that hard in&s;en&s;ibility which ob&s;tinately pur&s;ues its own cour&s;e, deaf to what is &s;aid, and indifferent to what is thought.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the ladies were now making way to the coffee-room, though very &s;lowly on account of the crowd; and ju&s;t as they got near the lobby, Cecilia perceived Mr. Belfield, who, immediately making him|&s;elf known to her, was offering his &s;ervice to hand her out of the pit, when Sir Ro|bert Floyer, not &s;eeing or not heeding him, pre&s;&s;ed forward, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Will you let me have the honour, Mi&s;s Beverley, of taking care of you?"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, to whom he grew daily more di&s;agreeable, coldly declined his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, while &s;he readily accepted that which had fir&s;t been offered her by Mr. Belfield.</P>
<P>The haughty Baronet, extremely nettled, forced his way on, and rudely &s;talking up to Mr. Belfield, motioned with his hand for room to pa&s;s him, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Make way, Sir!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Make way for <HI>me,</HI> Sir!"</Q> cried Bel|field, oppo&s;ing him with one hand, while with the other he held Cecilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You, Sir? and who are you, Sir?"</Q> demanded the Baronet, di&s;dainfully.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Of that, Sir, I &s;hall give you an ac|count whenever you plea&s;e,"</Q> an&s;wered Bel|field, with equal &s;corn.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="234">
<Q REND="inline">"What the devil do you mean, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing very difficult to be under|&s;tood,"</Q> replied Belfield, and attempted to draw on Cecilia, who, much alarmed, was &s;hrinking back.</P>
<P>Sir Robert then, &s;welling with rage, re|proachfully turned to her, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Will you &s;uffer &s;uch an impertinent fellow as that, Mi&s;s Beverley, to have the honour of taking your hand?"</Q></P>
<P>Belfield, with great indignation, de|manded what he meant by the term im|pertinent fellow; and Sir Robert, yet more in&s;olently repeated it: Cecilia, extremely &s;hocked, earne&s;tly be&s;ought them both to be quiet; but Belfield, at the repetition of this in&s;ult, ha&s;tily let go her hand and put his own upon his &s;word, while Sir Robert, taking advantage of his &s;ituation in being a &s;tep higher than his antagoni&s;t, fiercely pu&s;hed him back, and de&s;cended into the lobby.</P>
<P>Belfield, enraged beyond endurance, in|&s;tantly drew his &s;word, and Sir Robert was preparing to follow his example, when Ce|cilia, in an agony of fright, called out, <Q REND="inline">"Good Heaven! will nobody interfere?"</Q> And then a young man, forcing his way through the crowd, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"For &s;hame, for &s;hame, gentlemen! is this a place for &s;uch violence!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="235">
Belfield, endeavouring to recover him|&s;elf, put up his &s;word, and, though in a voice half choaked with pa&s;&s;ion, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I thank you, Sir! I was off my guard. I beg pardon of the whole company."</Q></P>
<P>Then, walking up to Sir Robert, he put into his hand a card with his name and di|rection, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"With you, Sir, I &s;hall be happy to &s;ettle what apologies are ne|ce&s;&s;ary at your fir&s;t lei&s;ure;"</Q> and hurried away.</P>
<P>Sir Robert, exclaiming aloud that he &s;hould &s;oon teach him to whom he had been &s;o impertinent, was immediately go|ing to follow him, when the affrighted Cecilia again called out aloud, <Q REND="inline">"Oh &s;top him!&mdash;good God! will nobody &s;top him!"</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The rapidity with which this angry &s;cene had pa&s;&s;ed had filled her with amaze|ment, and the evident re&s;entment of the Baronet upon her refu&s;ing his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, gave her an immediate con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that &s;he was her&s;elf the real cau&s;e of the quar|rel; while the manner in which he was preparing to follow Mr. Belfield, convinced her of the de&s;perate &s;cene which was likely to &s;ucceed; fear, therefore, overcoming every other feeling, forced from her this exclamation before &s;he knew what &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="236">
The moment &s;he had &s;poken, the young man who had already interpo&s;ed again ru&s;hed forward, and &s;eizing Sir Robert by the arm, warmly remon&s;trated again&s;t the violence of his proceedings, and being pre|&s;ently &s;econded by other gentlemen, almo&s;t compelled him to give up his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Then, ha&s;tening to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"Be not alarmed, madam,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"all is over, and every body is &s;afe."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, finding her&s;elf thus addre&s;&s;ed by a gentleman &s;he had never before &s;een, felt extremely a&s;hamed of having rendered her intere&s;t in the debate &s;o apparent; &s;he court&s;ied to him in &s;ome confu&s;ion, and taking hold of Mrs. Harrel's arm, hurried her back into the pit, in order to quit a crowd, of which &s;he now found her&s;elf the principal object.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity, however, was univer&s;ally ex|cited, and her retreat &s;erved but to inflame it: &s;ome of the ladies, and mo&s;t of the gentlemen, upon various pretences, re|turned into the pit merely to look at her, and in a few minutes the report was current that the young lady who had been the oc|ca&s;ion of the quarrel, was dying with love for Sir Robert Floyer.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, who had kept by her &s;ide during the whole affair, felt thunder|&s;truck by the emotion &s;he had &s;hewn; Mr.
<PB N="237" REF="237">
Arnott too, who had never quitted her, wi&s;hed him&s;elf expo&s;ed to the &s;ame danger as Sir Robert, &s;o that he might be ho|noured with the &s;ame concern: but they were both too much the dupes of their own apprehen&s;ions and jealou&s;y, to perceive that what they in&s;tantly imputed to fond|ne&s;s, proceeded &s;imply from general hu|manity, accidentally united with the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being acce&s;&s;ary to the quarrel.</P>
<P>The young &s;tranger who had officiated as mediator between the di&s;putants, in a few moments followed her with a gla&s;s of water, which he had brought from the coffee-room, begging her to drink it and compo&s;e her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though &s;he declined his civility with more vexation than gratitude, per|ceived, as &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes to thank him, that her new friend was a young man very &s;trikingly elegant in his addre&s;s and ap|pearance.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Larolles next, who, with her party, came back into the pit, ran up to Cecilia, crying, <Q REND="inline">"O my dear creature, what a mon&s;trous &s;hocking thing! You've no Idea how I am frightened; do you know I hap|pened to be quite at the further end of the coffee-room when it began, and I could not get out to &s;ee what was the matter for ten ages; only conceive what a &s;ituation!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="238">
<Q REND="inline">"Would your fright, then, have been le&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"had you been nearer the danger?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O Lord no, for when I came within &s;ight I was fifty times wor&s;e! I gave &s;uch a mon&s;trous &s;cream, that it quite made Mr. Meadows &s;tart. I dare &s;ay he'll tell me of it the&s;e hundred years: but really when I &s;aw them draw their &s;words I thought I &s;hould have died; I was &s;o amazingly &s;urprized you've no notion."</Q></P>
<P>Here &s;he was interrupted by the re-ap|pearance of the active &s;tranger, who again advancing to Cecilia, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am in doubt whether the efforts I make to revive will plea&s;e or irritate you, but though you re|jected the la&s;t cordial I ventured to pre&s;ent you, perhaps you will look with a more favourable eye towards that of which I am now the herald."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia then, ca&s;ting her eyes around, &s;aw that he was followed by Sir Robert Floyer. Full of di&s;plea&s;ure both at this introduction and at his pre&s;ence, &s;he turned ha&s;tily to Mr. Arnott, and entreated him to enquire if the carriage was not yet ready.</P>
<P>Sir Robert, looking at her with all the exultation of new-rai&s;ed vanity, &s;aid, with more &s;oftne&s;s than he had ever before ad|dre&s;&s;ed her, <Q REND="inline">"Have you been frightened?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="239">
<Q REND="inline">"Every body, I believe was frightened,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, with an air of dignity in|tended to check his ri&s;ing expectations.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There was no &s;ort of cau&s;e,"</Q> an&s;wered he; <Q REND="inline">"the fellow did not know whom he &s;poke too, that was all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, Sir Robert,"</Q> cried Mi&s;s La|rolles, <Q REND="inline">"how could you be &s;o &s;hocking as to draw your &s;word? you can't conceive how horrid it looked."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why I did not draw my &s;word,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"I only had my hand on the hilt."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lord, did not you, indeed! well, every body &s;aid you did, and I'm &s;ure I thought I &s;aw five-and-twenty &s;words all at once. I thought one of you would be killed every moment. It was horrid di&s;|agreeable, I a&s;&s;ure you."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Robert was now called away by &s;ome gentlemen; and Mr. Monckton, earne&s;t to be better informed of Cecilia's real &s;enti|ments, &s;aid, with affected concern, <Q REND="inline">"At pre&s;ent this matter is merely ridiculous; I am &s;orry to think in how &s;hort a time it may become more important."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Surely,"</Q> cried Cecilia with quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ome of their friends will interfere! &s;urely upon &s;o trifling a &s;ubject they will not be &s;o mad, &s;o inexcu&s;able, as to proceed to more &s;erious re&s;entment!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Which ever of them,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;tranger,
<PB N="240" REF="240">
<Q REND="inline">"is mo&s;t honoured by this anxiety, will be mad indeed to ri&s;k a life &s;o valued!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Cannot you, Mr. Monckton,</Q> "con|tinued Cecilia, too much alarmed to regard this in&s;inuation, <Q REND="inline">"&s;peak with Mr. Bel|field? You are acquainted with him, I know; is it impo&s;&s;ible you can follow him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will with plea&s;ure do whatever you wi&s;h; but &s;till if Sir Robert&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O, as to Sir Robert, Mr. Harrel, I am very &s;ure, will undertake him; I will try to &s;ee him to-night my&s;elf, and entreat him to exert all his influence."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, madam,"</Q> cried the &s;tranger, archly, and lowering his voice, <Q REND="inline">"tho&s;e <HI>French beads</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol &s;tones</HI> have not, I find, &s;hone in vain!"</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e words Cecilia recognized her white domino acquaintance at the ma&s;que|rade; &s;he had before recollected his voice, but was too much perturbed to con&s;ider where or when &s;he had heard it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If Mr. Briggs,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"does not &s;peedily come forth with his plum friend, before the glittering of &s;words and &s;pears is joined to that of jewels, the glare will be &s;o re&s;plendent, that he will fear to come within the influence of its rays. Though, perhaps, he may only think the &s;tronger the light, the better he &s;hall &s;ee to count his guineas: for as
<Q><PB N="241" REF="241">
<L>" &mdash;in ten thou&s;and pounds</L>
<L>" Ten thou&s;and charms are centred,"</L></Q>
in an hundred thou&s;and, the charms may have &s;uch magic power, that he may defy the united efforts of tin&s;el and knight-erran|try to deliver you from the golden &s;pell."</Q></P>
<P>Here the captain, advancing to Cecilia, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I have been looking for you in vain <HI>partout,</HI> but the crowd has been &s;o <HI>accablant</HI> I was almo&s;t reduced to de&s;pair. Give me leave to hope you are now recovered from the <HI>horreur</HI> of this little <HI>fracas?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Arnott then brought intelligence that the carriage was ready. Cecilia, glad to be gone, in&s;tantly ha&s;tened to it; and, as &s;he was conducted by Mr. Monckton, mo&s;t earne&s;tly entreated him to take an active part, in endeavouring to prevent the fatal con&s;equences with which the quarrel &s;eemed likely to terminate.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="242" REF="242">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. A FASHIONABLE FRIEND.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as they returned home, Cecilia begged Mrs. Harrel not to lo&s;e a mo|ment before &s;he tried to acquaint Mr. Har|rel with the &s;tate of the affair. But that lady was too helple&s;s to know in what man|ner to &s;et about it; &s;he could not tell where he was, &s;he could not conjecture where he might be.</P>
<P>Cecilia then rang for his own man, and upon enquiry, heard that he was, in all probability, at Brookes's in St. James's|Street.</P>
<P>She then begged Mrs. Harrel would write to him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel knew not what to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Cecilia therefore, equally quick in form|ing and executing her de&s;igns, wrote to him her&s;elf, and entreated that without lo&s;ing an in&s;tant he would find out his friend Sir Ro|bert Floyer, and endeavour to effect an ac|commodation between him and Mr. Belfield, with whom he had had a di&s;pute at the Opera-hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="243">
The man &s;oon returned with an an&s;wer that Mr. Harrel would not fail to obey her commands.</P>
<P>She determined to &s;it up till he came home in order to learn the event of the ne|gociation. She con&s;idered her&s;elf as the ef|ficient cau&s;e of the quarrel, yet &s;carce knew how or in what to blame her&s;elf; the beha|viour of Sir Robert had always been offen|&s;ive to her; &s;he di&s;liked his manners, and dete&s;ted his boldne&s;s; and &s;he had already &s;hewn her intention to accept the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Belfield before he had followed her with an offer of his own. She was uncer|tain, indeed, whether he had remarked what had pa&s;&s;ed, but &s;he had rea&s;on to think that, &s;o circum&s;tanced, to have changed her purpo&s;e, would have been con|&s;trued into an encouragement that might have authori&s;ed his future pre&s;umption of her favour. All &s;he could find to regret with regard to her&s;elf, was wanting the pre|&s;ence of mind to have refu&s;ed the civilities of both.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel, though really &s;orry at the &s;tate of the affair, regarded her&s;elf as &s;o entirely unconcerned in it, that, ea&s;ily wearied when out of company, &s;he &s;oon grew &s;leepy, and retired to her own room.</P>
<P>The anxious Cecilia, hoping every in|&s;tant the return of Mr. Harrel, &s;at up by
<PB N="244" REF="244">
her&s;elf: but it was not till near four o'clock in the morning that he made his appear|ance.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, &s;ir,"</Q> cried &s;he, the moment &s;he &s;aw him, <Q REND="inline">"I fear by your coming home &s;o late you have had much trouble, but I hope it has been &s;ucce&s;sful?"</Q></P>
<P>Great, however, was her mortification when he an&s;wered that he had not even &s;een the Baronet, having been engaged him&s;elf in &s;o particular a manner, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly break from his party till pa&s;t three o'clock, at which time he drove to the hou&s;e of Sir Robert, but heard that he was not yet come home.</P>
<P>Cecilia, though much di&s;gu&s;ted by &s;uch a &s;pecimen of in&s;en&s;ibility towards a man whom he pretended to call his friend, would not leave him till he had promi&s;ed to ari&s;e as &s;oon as it was light, and make an effort to recover the time lo&s;t.</P>
<P>She was now no longer &s;urpri&s;ed either at the debts of Mr. Harrel, or at his <HI>par|ticular occa&s;ions</HI> for money. She was con|vinced he &s;pent half the night in gaming, and the con&s;equences, however dreadful, were but natural. That Sir Robert Floyer al&s;o did the &s;ame was a matter of much le&s;s importance to her, but that the life of any man &s;hould through her means be endan|gered, di&s;turbed her inexpre&s;&s;ibly.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="245">
She went, however, to bed, but aro&s;e again at &s;ix o'clock, and dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf by candle light. In an hour's time &s;he &s;ent to enquire if Mr. Harrel was &s;tirring, and hearing he was a&s;leep, gave orders to have him called. Yet he did not ri&s;e till eight o'clock, nor could all her me&s;&s;ages or expo&s;tulations drive him out of the hou&s;e till nine.</P>
<P>He was &s;carcely gone before Mr. Monck|ton arrived, who now for the fir&s;t time had the &s;atisfaction of finding her alone.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are very good for coming &s;o early,"</Q> cried &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"have you &s;een Mr. Belfield? Have you had any conver&s;ation with him?"</Q></P>
<P>Alarmed at her eagerne&s;s, and &s;till more at &s;eeing by her looks the &s;leeple&s;s night &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed, he made at fir&s;t no reply; and when, with encrea&s;ing impatience, &s;he re|peated her que&s;tion, he only &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Has Belfield ever vi&s;ited you &s;ince he had the honour of meeting you at my hou&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, never."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have you &s;een him often in public?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, I have never &s;een him at all but the evening Mrs. Harrel received ma&s;ks, and la&s;t night at the Opera."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is it, then, for the &s;afety of Sir Robert you are &s;o extremely anxious?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is for the &s;afety of both; the cau&s;e of their quarrel was &s;o trifling, that I can|not
<PB N="246" REF="246">
bear to think its con&s;equence &s;hould be &s;erious."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But do you not wi&s;h better to one of them than to the other?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As a matter of ju&s;tice I do, but not from any partiality: Sir Robert was un|doubtedly the aggre&s;&s;or, and Mr. Belfield, though at fir&s;t too fiery, was certainly ill u&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P>The candour of this &s;peech recovered Mr. Monckton from his apprehen&s;ions; and, carefully ob&s;erving her looks while he &s;poke, he gave her the following account.</P>
<P>That he had ha&s;tened to Belfield's lodg|ings the moment he left the Opera-hou&s;e, and, after repeated denials, ab&s;olutely forced him&s;elf into his room, where he was quite alone, and in much agitation: he con|ver&s;ed with him for more than an hour upon the &s;ubject of the quarrel, but found he &s;o warmly re&s;ented the per&s;onal in&s;ult given him by Sir Robert, that no remon&s;trance had any effect in making him alter his re|&s;olution of demanding &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And could you bring him to con&s;ent to no compromi&s;e before you left him?"</Q> cried Cecilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No; for before I got to him&mdash;the chal|lenge had been &s;ent."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The challenge! good heaven!&mdash;and do you know the event?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="247">
<Q REND="inline">"I called again this morning at his lodgings, but he was not returned home."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And was it impo&s;&s;ible to follow him? Were there no means to di&s;cover whither he was gone?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"None; to elude all pur&s;uit, he went out before any body in the hou&s;e was &s;tir|ring, and took his &s;ervant with him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have you, then, been to Sir Ro|bert?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have been to Cavendi&s;h-Square, but there, it &s;eems, he has not appeared all night; I traced him, through his &s;ervants, from the Opera to a gaming-hou&s;e, where I found he had amu&s;ed him&s;elf till this morn|ing."</Q></P>
<P>The unea&s;ine&s;s of Cecilia now encrea&s;ed every moment; and Mr. Monckton, &s;eeing he had no other chance of &s;atisfying her, offered his &s;ervice to go again in &s;earch of both the gentlemen, and endeavour to bring her better information. She accepted the propo&s;al with gratitude, and he de|parted.</P>
<P>Soon after &s;he was joined by Mr. Arnott, who, though &s;eized with all the horrors of jealou&s;y at &s;ight of her apprehen&s;ions, was &s;o de&s;irous to relieve them, that without even making any merit of obliging her, he almo&s;t in&s;tantly &s;et out upon the &s;ame er|rand that employed Mr. Monckton, and
<PB N="248" REF="248">
determined not to mention his de&s;ign till he found whether it would enable him to bring her good tidings.</P>
<P>He was &s;carce gone when &s;he was told that Mr. Delvile begged to have the honour of &s;peaking to her. Surpri&s;ed at this con|de&s;cen&s;ion, &s;he de&s;ired he might immedi|ately be admitted; but much was her &s;ur|pri&s;e augmented, when, in&s;tead of &s;eeing her o&s;tentatious guardian, &s;he again beheld her ma&s;querade friend, the white domino.</P>
<P>He entreated her pardon for an intru&s;ion neither authori&s;ed by acquaintance nor by bu&s;ine&s;s, though &s;omewhat, he hoped, pal|liated, by his near connection with one who was privileged to take an intere&s;t in her af|fairs: and then, ha&s;tening to the motives which had occa&s;ioned his vi&s;it, <Q REND="inline">"when I had the honour,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"of &s;eeing you la&s;t night at the Opera-hou&s;e, the di&s;pute which had ju&s;t happened between two gen|tlemen, &s;eemed to give you an unea&s;ine&s;s which could not but be painful to all who ob&s;erved it, and as among that number I was not the lea&s;t moved, you will forgive, I hope, my eagerne&s;s to be the fir&s;t to bring you intelligence that nothing fatal has hap|pened, or is likely to happen."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You do me, &s;ir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"much honour; and indeed you relieve me from a &s;u&s;pence extremely di&s;agreeable. The ac|commodation,
<PB N="249" REF="249">
I &s;uppo&s;e, was brought about this morning?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I find,"</Q> an&s;wered he, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"You now expect too much; but hope is never &s;o ela&s;tic as when it &s;prings from the ruins of terror."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What then is the matter? Are they at la&s;t, not &s;afe?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, perfectly &s;afe; but I cannot tell you they have never been in danger."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, if it is now over I am contented: but you will very much oblige me, &s;ir, if you will inform me what has pa&s;&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You oblige me, madam, by the honour of your commands. I &s;aw but too much rea&s;on to apprehend that mea&s;ures the mo&s;t violent would follow the affray of la&s;t night; yet as I found that the quarrel had been ac|cidental, and the offence unpremeditated, I thought it not ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible that an expeditious mediation might effect a com|promi&s;e: at lea&s;t it was worth trying; for though wrath &s;lowly kindled or long nou|ri&s;hed is &s;ullen and intractable, the &s;udden anger that has not had time to impre&s;s the mind with a deep &s;en&s;e of injury, will, when gently managed, be &s;ometimes appea&s;ed with the &s;ame quickne&s;s it is excited: I hoped, therefore, that &s;ome trifling conce&s;|&s;ion from Sir Robert, as the aggre&s;&s;or,&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="250">
<Q REND="inline">"Ah &s;ir!"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that, I fear, was not to be obtained!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not by me, I mu&s;t own,"</Q> he an&s;wered; <Q REND="inline">"but I was not willing to think of the dif|ficulty, and therefore ventured to make the propo&s;al: nor did I leave the Opera|hou&s;e till I had u&s;ed every po&s;&s;ible argu|ment to per&s;uade Sir Robert an apology would neither &s;tain his courage nor his re|putation. But his &s;pirit brooked not the humiliation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Spirit!"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"how mild a word! What, then, could poor Mr. Belfield re&s;olve upon?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That, I believe, took him very little time to decide. I di&s;covered, by means of a gentleman at the Opera who was ac|quainted with him, where he lived, and I waited upon him with an intention to offer my &s;ervices towards &s;ettling the affair by arbitration: for &s;ince you call him <HI>poor</HI> Mr. Belfield, I think you will permit me, without offence to his antagoni&s;t, to own that his gallantry, though too impetuous for commendation, engaged me in his intere&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope you don't think,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that an offence to his antagoni&s;t mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be an offence to me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whatever I may have thought,"</Q> an|&s;wered he, looking at her with evident &s;ur|pri&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"I certainly did not wi&s;h that a
<PB N="251" REF="251">
&s;ympathy offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive had been concluded between you. I could not, how|ever, gain acce&s;s to Mr. Belfield la&s;t night, but the affair dwelt upon my mind, and this morning I called at his lodging as &s;oon as it was light?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How good you have been!"</Q> cried Ce|cilia; <Q REND="inline">"your kind offices have not, I hope, all proved ineffectual!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So valourous a Don Quixote,"</Q> re|turned he, laughing, <Q REND="inline">"certainly merited a faithful E&s;quire! he was, however, gone out, and nobody knew whither. About half an hour ago I called upon him again; he was then ju&s;t returned home."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;aw him; the affair was over; and in a &s;hort time he will be able, if you will al|low him &s;o much honour, to thank you for the&s;e enquiries."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is then wounded?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is a little hurt, but Sir Robert is perfectly &s;afe. Belfield fired fir&s;t, and mi&s;|&s;ed; the Baronet was not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am grieved to hear it, indeed! and where is the wound?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The ball entered his right &s;ide, and the moment he felt it, he fired his &s;econd pi&s;tol in the air. This I heard from his &s;ervant. He was brought home carefully and &s;lowly; no &s;urgeon had been upon the
<PB N="252" REF="252">
&s;pot, but one was called to him immedi|ately. I &s;tayed to enquire his opinion after the wound had been dre&s;&s;ed: he told me he had extracted the ball, and a&s;&s;ured me Mr. Belfield was not in any danger. Your alarm, madam, la&s;t night, which had always been pre&s;ent to me, then encouraged me to take the liberty of waiting upon you; for I concluded you could yet have had no cer|tain intelligence, and thought it be&s;t to let the plain and &s;imple fact out-run the prob|able exaggeration of rumour."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia thanked him for his attention, and Mrs. Harrel then making her appearance, he aro&s;e and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Had my father known the honour I have had this morning of waiting upon Mi&s;s Beverley, I am &s;ure I &s;hould have been charged with his compli|ments, and &s;uch a commi&s;&s;ion would &s;ome|what have le&s;&s;ened the pre&s;umption of this vi|&s;it; but I feared le&s;t while I &s;hould be making intere&s;t for my credentials, the pretence of my emba&s;&s;y might be lo&s;t, and other couriers, le&s;s &s;crupulous, might obtain previous audiences, and anticipate my di&s;patches."</Q></P>
<P>He then took his leave.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This white domino, at la&s;t then,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"is the &s;on of Mr. Delvile! and thence the knowledge of my &s;ituation which gave me &s;o much &s;urpri&s;e:&mdash;a &s;on how infinitely unlike his father!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="253">
<Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"and as un|like his mother too, for I a&s;&s;ure you &s;he is more proud and haughty even than the old gentleman. I hate the very &s;ight of her, for &s;he keeps every body in &s;uch awe that there's nothing but re&s;traint in her pre&s;ence. But the &s;on is a very pretty young man, and much admired; though I have only &s;een him in public, for none of the family vi&s;it here."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, who now &s;oon returned, was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find that all the intelligence he meant to communicate was already known: and not the more plea&s;ed to hear that the white domino, to whom be|fore he owed no good will, had thus offici|ou&s;ly preceded him.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnott, who al&s;o came ju&s;t after him, had been &s;o little &s;atisfied with the re&s;ult of his enquiries, that from the fear of encrea&s;|ing Cecilia's unea&s;ine&s;s, he determined not to make known whither he had been; but he &s;oon found his forbearance was of no avail, as &s;he was already acquainted with the duel and its con&s;equences. Yet his un|remitting de&s;ire to oblige her urged him twice in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame day to again call at Mr. Belfield's lodgings, in order to bring her thence fre&s;h and un&s;olicited intelli|gence.</P>
<P>Before breakfa&s;t was quite over, Mi&s;s
<PB N="254" REF="254">
Larolles, out of breath with eagerne&s;s, came to tell the news of the duel, in her way to <HI>church,</HI> as it was Sunday morning! and &s;oon after Mrs. Mears, who al&s;o was followed by other ladies, brought the &s;ame account, which by all was addre&s;&s;ed to Ce|cilia, with expre&s;&s;ions of concern that con|vinced her, to her infinite vexation, &s;he was generally regarded as the per&s;on chiefly in|tere&s;ted in the accident.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel did not return till late, but then &s;eemed in very high &s;pirits: <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"I bring you news that will repay all your fright; Sir Robert is not only &s;afe, but is come off con|queror."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very &s;orry, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered Ceci|lia, extremely provoked to be thus con|gratulated, <Q REND="inline">"that any body conquered, or any body was vanqui&s;hed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is no need for &s;orrow,"</Q> cried Mr. Harrel, <Q REND="inline">"or for any thing but joy, for he has not killed his man; the victory, therefore, will neither co&s;t him a flight nor a trial. To-day he means to wait upon you, and lay his laurels at your feet."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He means, then, to take very fruitle&s;s trouble,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"for I have not any ambition to be &s;o honoured.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah, Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> returned he,
<PB N="255" REF="255">
laughing, <Q REND="inline">"this won't do now! it might have pa&s;&s;ed a little while ago, but it won't do now, I promi&s;e you!"</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, though much di&s;plea&s;ed by this accu&s;ation, found that di&s;claiming it only excited further raillery, and therefore pre|vailed upon her&s;elf to give him a quiet hearing, and &s;carce any reply.</P>
<P>At dinner, when Sir Robert arrived, the di&s;like &s;he had originally taken to him, en|crea&s;ed already into di&s;gu&s;t by his behaviour the preceding evening, was now fixed into the &s;tronge&s;t aver&s;ion by the horror &s;he conceived of his fiercene&s;s, and the indig|nation &s;he felt excited by his arrogance. He &s;eemed, from the &s;ucce&s;s of this duel, to think him&s;elf rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t pin|nacle of human glory; triumph &s;at exult|ing on his brow; he looked down on who|ever he deigned to look at all, and &s;hewed that he thought his notice an honour, how|ever imperious the manner in which it was accorded.</P>
<P>Upon Cecilia, however, he ca&s;t an eye of more complacency; he now believed her &s;ubdued, and his vanity revelled in the be|lief: her anxiety had &s;o thoroughly &s;atisfied him of her love, that &s;he had hardly the power left to undeceive him; her &s;ilence he only attributed to admiration, her cold|ne&s;s to fear, and her re&s;erve to &s;hame.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="256">
Sickened by in&s;olence &s;o undi&s;gui&s;ed and unauthori&s;ed, and incen&s;ed at the triumph of his &s;ucce&s;sful brutality, Cecilia with pain kept her &s;eat, and with vexation re|flected upon the nece&s;&s;ity &s;he was under of pa&s;&s;ing &s;o large a portion of her time in company to which &s;he was &s;o extremely aver&s;e.</P>
<P>After dinner, when Mrs. Harrel was talk|ing of her party for the evening, of which Cecilia declined making one, Sir Robert, with a &s;ort of proud humility, that half feared rejection, and half proclaimed an indifference to meeting it, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"I don't much care for going further my&s;elf, if Mi&s;s Beverley will give me the honour of taking my tea with her."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, regarding him with much &s;ur|pri&s;e, an&s;wered that &s;he had letters to write into the country, which would con|fine her to her own room for the re&s;t of the evening. The Baronet, looking at his watch, in&s;tantly cried <Q REND="inline">"Faith, that is very fortunate, for I have ju&s;t recol|lected an engagement at the other end of the town which had &s;lipt my memory."</Q></P>
<P>Soon after they were all gone, Cecilia received a note from Mrs. Delvile, beg|ging the favour of her company the next morning to breakfa&s;t. She readily
<PB N="257" REF="257">
accepted the invitation, though &s;he was by no means prepared, by the character &s;he had heard of her, to expect much plea&s;ure from an acquaintance with that lady.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. A FAMILY PARTY.</HEAD>
<P>CECILIA the next morning, between nine and ten o'clock, went to St. James'|&s;quare; &s;he found nobody immediately ready to receive her, but in a &s;hort time was waited upon by Mr. Delvile.</P>
<P>After the u&s;ual &s;alutations, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Be|verley,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I have given expre&s;s orders to my people, that I may not be in|terrupted while I have the plea&s;ure of pa&s;|&s;ing &s;ome minutes in conver&s;ation with you before you are pre&s;ented to Mrs. Del|vile."</Q></P>
<P>And then, with an air of &s;olemnity, he led her to a &s;eat, and having him&s;elf taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another, continued his &s;peech.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have received information, from au|thority which I cannot doubt, that the in|di&s;cretion of certain of your admirers la&s;t Saturday at the Opera-hou&s;e, occa&s;ioned a di&s;turbance which to a young woman of delicacy I &s;hould imagine mu&s;t be very alarming: now as I con&s;ider my&s;elf con|cerned in your fame and welfare from re|garding
<PB N="259" REF="259">
 you as my ward, I think it is in|cumbent upon me to make enquiries into &s;uch of your affairs as become public; for I &s;hould feel in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;graced my&s;elf, &s;hould it appear to the world, while you are under my guardian&s;hip, that there was any want of propriety in the direction of your conduct."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, not much flattered by this ad|dre&s;s, gravely an&s;wered that &s;he fancied the affair had been mi&s;repre&s;ented to him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am not much addicted,"</Q> he replied, <Q REND="inline">"to give ear to any thing lightly; you mu&s;t therefore permit me to enquire in|to the merits of the cau&s;e, and then to draw my own inferences. And let me, at the &s;ame time, a&s;&s;ure you there is no other young lady who has any right to expect &s;uch an attention from me. I mu&s;t begin by begging you to inform me upon what grounds the two gentlemen in que&s;tion, for &s;uch, by courte&s;y, I pre&s;ume they are called, thought them&s;elves entitled publicly to di&s;|pute your favour?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My favour, Sir!"</Q> cried Cecilia, much amazed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear,"</Q> &s;aid he, with a compla|cency meant to give her courage, <Q REND="inline">"I know the que&s;tion is difficult for a young lady to an&s;wer; but be not aba&s;hed, I &s;hould be &s;orry to di&s;tre&s;s you, and mean to the ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="260" REF="260">
of my power to &s;ave your blu&s;hes. Do not, therefore, fear me; con&s;ider me as your guardian, and a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf I am perfectly well di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ider you as my ward. Acquaint me, then, freely, what are the preten&s;ions of the&s;e gentlemen?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To me, Sir, they have, I believe, no preten&s;ions at all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee you are &s;hy,"</Q> returned he, with encrea&s;ing gentlene&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee you cannot be ea&s;y with me; and when I con&s;ider how little you are accu&s;tomed to me, I do not wonder. But pray take courage, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to inform my&s;elf of your af|fairs, and therefore I beg you will &s;peak to me with freedom."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, more and more mortified by this humiliating conde&s;cen&s;ion, again a&s;&s;ured him he had been mi&s;informed, and was again, though di&s;credited, prai&s;ed for her mode&s;ty, when, to her great relief, they were interrupted by the entrance of her friend the <HI>white domino.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mortimer,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"I un|der&s;tand you have already had the plea|&s;ure of &s;eeing this young lady?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir,"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"I have more than once had that happine&s;s, but I have never had the honour of being introduced to her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Beverley, then,"</Q> &s;aid the father,
<PB N="261" REF="261">
<Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t pre&s;ent to you Mr. Mortimer Del|vile, my &s;on; and, Mortimer, in Mi&s;s Be|verley I de&s;ire you will remember that you re&s;pect a ward of your father's."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will not, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"for|get an injunction my own inclinations had already out-run."</Q></P>
<P>Mortimer Delvile was tall and finely formed, his features, though not hand&s;ome, were full of expre&s;&s;ion, and a noble openne&s;s of manners and addre&s;s &s;poke the elegance of his education, and the liberality of his mind.</P>
<P>When this introduction was over, a more general conver&s;ation took place, till Mr. Delvile, &s;uddenly ri&s;ing, &s;aid to Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"You will pardon me, Mi&s;s Beverley, if I leave you for a few minutes; one of my tenants &s;ets out to-morrow morning for my e&s;tate in the North, and he has been two hours waiting to &s;peak with me. But if my &s;on is not particularly engaged, I am &s;ure he will be &s;o good as to do the ho|nours of the hou&s;e till his mother is ready to receive you."</Q></P>
<P>And then, graciou&s;ly waving his hand, he quitted the room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My father,"</Q> cried young Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"has left me an office which, could I execute it as perfectly as I &s;hall willingly, would be performed without a fault."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="262">
<Q REND="inline">"I am very &s;orry,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that I have &s;o much mi&s;taken your hour of breakfa&s;t; but let me not be any re&s;traint upon you, I &s;hall find a book, or a news|paper, or &s;omething to fill up the time till Mrs. Delvile honours me with a &s;um|mons."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You can only be a re&s;traint upon me,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"by commanding me from your pre&s;ence. I breakfa&s;ted long ago, and am now ju&s;t come from Mr. Belfield. I had the plea&s;ure, this morning, of being admitted into his room."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And how, Sir, did you find him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not &s;o well, I fear, as he thinks him|&s;elf; but he was in high &s;pirits, and &s;ur|rounded by his friends, whom he was en|tertaining with all the gaiety of a man in full health, and entirely at his ea&s;e; though I perceived, by the frequent changes of his countenance, &s;igns of pain and indi&s;po&s;i|tion, that made me, however plea&s;ed with his conver&s;ation, think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;horten my own vi&s;it, and to hint to tho&s;e who were near me the propriety of leaving him quiet."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did you &s;ee his &s;urgeon, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No; but he told me he &s;hould only have one dre&s;&s;ing more of his wound, and then get rid of the whole bu&s;ine&s;s by run|ning into the country."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="263">
<Q REND="inline">"Were you acquainted with him, Sir, before this accident?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, not at all; but the little I have &s;een of him has &s;trongly intere&s;ted me in his favour: at Mr. Harrel's ma&s;querade, where I fir&s;t met with him, I was extremely enter|tained by his humour,&mdash;though there, per|haps, as I had al&s;o the honour of fir&s;t &s;ee|ing Mi&s;s Beverley, I might be too happy to feel much difficulty in being plea&s;ed. And even at the Opera he had the advan|tage of finding me in the &s;ame favourable di&s;po&s;ition, as I had long di&s;tingui&s;hed you be|fore I had taken any notice of him. I mu&s;t, however, confe&s;s I did not think his anger that evening quite without provocation,&mdash;but I beg your pardon, I may perhaps be mi&s;taken, and you, who know the whole affair, mu&s;t undoubtedly be better able to account for what happened."</Q></P>
<P>Here he fixed his eyes upon Cecilia, with a look of curio&s;ity that &s;eemed eager to penetrate into her &s;entiments of the two antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, certainly,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"he had all the provocation that ill-breeding could give him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And do you, madam,"</Q> cried he, with much &s;urprize, <Q REND="inline">"judge of this matter with &s;uch &s;everity?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="264">
<Q REND="inline">"No, not with &s;everity, &s;imply with candour."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With candour? alas, then, poor Sir Robert! Severity were not half &s;o bad a &s;ign for him!"</Q></P>
<P>A &s;ervant now came in, to acquaint Ce|cilia that Mrs. Delvile waited breakfa&s;t for her.</P>
<P>This &s;ummons was immediately followed by the re-entrance of Mr. Delvile, who, taking her hand, &s;aid he would him&s;elf pre&s;ent her to his lady, and with much gra|ciou&s;ne&s;s a&s;&s;ured her of a kind reception.</P>
<P>The ceremonies preceding this interview, added to the character &s;he had already heard of Mrs. Delvile, made Cecilia hear|tily wi&s;h it over; but, a&s;&s;uming all the courage in her power, &s;he determined to &s;upport her&s;elf with a &s;pirit that &s;hould &s;truggle again&s;t the o&s;tentatious &s;uperiority &s;he was prepared to expect.</P>
<P>She found her &s;eated upon a &s;ofa, from which, however, &s;he aro&s;e at her approach; but the moment Cecilia beheld her, all the unfavourable impre&s;&s;ions with which &s;he came into her pre&s;ence immediately va|ni&s;hed, and that re&s;pect which the forma|lities of her introduction had failed to in|&s;pire, her air, figure, and countenance in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly excited.</P>
<P>She was not more than fifty years of
<PB N="265" REF="265">
age; her complection, though faded, kept the traces of its former loveline&s;s, her eyes, though they had lo&s;t their youthful fire, retained a lu&s;tre that evinced their primeval brilliancy, and the fine &s;ymmetry of her features, &s;till uninjured by the &s;iege of time, not only indicated the perfection of her juvenile beauty, but &s;till laid claim to admiration in every beholder.</P>
<P>Her carriage was lofty and command|ing; but the dignity to which high birth and con&s;cious &s;uperiority gave ri&s;e, was &s;o judiciou&s;ly regulated by good &s;en&s;e, and &s;o happily blended with politene&s;s, that though the world at large envied or hated her, the few for whom &s;he had her&s;elf any regard, &s;he was infallibly certain to captivate.</P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;e and admiration with which Cecilia at the fir&s;t glance was &s;truck proved reciprocal: Mrs. Delvile, though prepared for youth and beauty, expected not to &s;ee a countenance &s;o intelligent, nor manners &s;o well formed as tho&s;e of Cecilia: thus mutually a&s;toni&s;hed and mutually plea&s;ed, their fir&s;t &s;alutations were accompanied by looks &s;o flattering to both, that each &s;aw in the other, an immediate prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in her favour, and from the moment that they met, they &s;eemed in&s;tinctively im|pelled to admire.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have promi&s;ed Mi&s;s Beverley, madam,"</Q>
<PB N="266" REF="266">
&s;aid Mr. Delvile to his lady, <Q REND="inline">"that you would give her a kind reception; and I need not remind you that my promi&s;es are always held &s;acred."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But I hope you have not al&s;o pro|mi&s;ed,"</Q> cried &s;he, with quickne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"that I &s;hould give <HI>you</HI> a kind reception, for I feel at this very moment extremely in|clined to quarrel with you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why &s;o, madam?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"For not bringing us together &s;ooner; for now I have &s;een her, I already look back with regret to the time I have lo&s;t without the plea&s;ure of knowing her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What a claim is this,"</Q> cried young Delvile," <Q REND="inline">upon the benevolence of Mi&s;s Beverley! for if &s;he has not now the in|dulgence by frequent and diligent vi&s;its to make &s;ome reparation, &s;he mu&s;t con&s;ider her&s;elf as re&s;pon&s;ible for the di&s;&s;ention &s;he will occa&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If peace depends upon my vi&s;its,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"it may immediately be proclaimed; were it to be procured only by my ab&s;ence, I know not if I &s;hould &s;o readily agree to the conditions."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t reque&s;t of you, madam,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"that when my &s;on and I retire, you will be&s;tow half an hour upon this young lady, in making enquiries con|cerning the di&s;turbance la&s;t Saturday at the
<PB N="267" REF="267">
Opera-Hou&s;e. I have not, my&s;elf, &s;o much time to &s;pare, as I have &s;everal appoint|ments for this morning; but I am &s;ure you will not object to the office, as I know you to be equally anxious with my&s;elf, that the minority of Mi&s;s Beverley &s;hould pa&s;s without reproach."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not only her minority, but her ma|turity,"</Q> cried young Delvile, warmly, <Q REND="inline">"and not only her maturity, but her decline of life will pa&s;s, I hope, not merely with|out reproach, but with fame and ap|plau&s;e!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope &s;o too;"</Q> replied Mr. Delvile: <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h her well through every &s;tage of her life, but for her minority alone it is my bu&s;ine&s;s to do more than wi&s;h. For that, I feel my own honour and my own credit concerned; my honour, as I gave it to the Dean that I would &s;uperintend her conduct, and my credit, as the world is acquainted with the claim &s;he has to my protection."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will not make any enquiries,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, turning to Cecilia with a &s;weetne&s;s that recompen&s;ed her for the haughtine&s;s of her guardian, <Q REND="inline">"till I have had &s;ome opportunity of convincing Mi&s;s Beverley, that my regard for her merits they &s;hould be an&s;wered."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;ee, Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> &s;aid Mr.
<PB N="268" REF="268">
Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"how little rea&s;on you had to be afraid of us; Mrs. Delvile is as much di&s;po&s;ed in your favour as my&s;elf, and as de&s;irous to be of &s;ervice to you. Endea|vour, therefore, to ca&s;t off this timidity, and to make your&s;elf ea&s;y. You mu&s;t come to ut often; u&s;e will do more towards remov|ing your fears, than all the encouragement we can give you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But what are the fears,"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"that Mi&s;s Beverley can have to remove? unle&s;s, indeed, &s;he apprehends her vi&s;its will make us encroachers, and that the more we are favoured with her pre|&s;ence, the le&s;s we &s;hall bear her ab&s;ence."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, &s;on,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"what was the name of the per&s;on who was Sir Robert Floyer's opponent? I have again forgotten it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Belfield, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True; it is a name I am perfectly un|acquainted with: however, he may po&s;&s;ibly be a very good &s;ort of man; but certainly his oppo&s;ing him&s;elf to Sir Robert Floyer, a man of &s;ome family, a gentleman, rich, and allied to &s;ome people of di&s;tinction, was a rather &s;trange circum&s;tance: I mean not, however, to prejudge the ca&s;e; I will hear it fairly &s;tated; and am the more di&s;|po&s;ed to be cautious in what I pronounce, becau&s;e I am per&s;uaded Mi&s;s Beverley has
<PB N="269" REF="269">
too much &s;en&s;e to let my advice be thrown away upon her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope &s;o, Sir; but with re&s;pect to the di&s;turbance at the Opera, I know not that I have the lea&s;t occa&s;ion to trouble you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If your mea&s;ures,"</Q> &s;aid he, very gravely, <Q REND="inline">"are already taken, the Dean your uncle prevailed upon me to accept a very u&s;ele&s;s office; but if any thing is yet undecided, it will not, perhaps, be ami&s;s that I &s;hould be con&s;ulted. Mean time, I will only re|commend to you to con&s;ider that Mr. Bel|field is a per&s;on who&s;e name nobody has heard, and that a connection with Sir Ro|bert Floyer would certainly be very honour|able for you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"here is &s;ome great mi&s;take; neither of the&s;e gen|tlemen, I believe, think of me at all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They have taken, then,"</Q> cried young Delvile with a laugh, <Q REND="inline">"a very extraordinary method to prove their indifference!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The affairs of Sir Robert Floyer,"</Q> continued Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"are indeed, I am informed, in &s;ome di&s;order; but he has a noble e&s;tate, and your fortune would &s;oon clear all its incumbrances. Such an alli|ance, therefore, would be mutually advan|tageous: but what would re&s;ult from a union with &s;uch a per&s;on as Mr. Belfield? he is of no family, though in that, perhaps,
<PB N="270" REF="270">
you would not be very &s;crupulous; but nei|ther has he any money; what, then, recom|mends him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To me, Sir, nothing!"</Q> an&s;wered Ce|cilia.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And to me,"</Q> cried young Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"almo&s;t every thing! he has wit, &s;pirit, and under&s;tanding, talents to create admir|ation, and qualities, I believe, to engage e&s;teem!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;peak warmly,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Del|vile; <Q REND="inline">"but if &s;uch is his character, he merits your earne&s;tne&s;s. What is it you know of him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not enough, perhaps,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"to coolly ju&s;tify my prai&s;e; but he is one of tho&s;e who&s;e fir&s;t appearance takes the mind by &s;urpri&s;e, and leaves the judgment to make afterwards &s;uch terms as it can. Will you, madam, when he is recovered, permit me to introduce him to you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly;"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, &s;miling; <Q REND="inline">"but have a care your recommendation does not di&s;grace your di&s;cernment."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This warmth of di&s;po&s;ition, Morti|mer,"</Q> cried Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"produces no|thing but difficulties and trouble: you neglect the connections I point out, and which a little attention might render &s;er|viceable as well as honourable, and run precipitately into forming &s;uch as can do
<PB N="271" REF="271">
you no good among people of rank, and are not only profitle&s;s in them&s;elves, but generally lead you into expence and incon|venience.

<P><Q REND="inline">"I know not, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"how Mr. Belfield de&s;erves to be called an ad|venturer: he is not, indeed, rich; but he is in a profe&s;&s;ion where parts &s;uch as his &s;eldom fail to acquire riches; however, as to me his wealth can be of no con&s;equence, why &s;hould my regard to him wait for it? if he is a young man of worth and ho|nour&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mortimer,"</Q> interrupted Mr. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"whatever he is, we know he is not a man of rank, and whatever he may be, we know he cannot become a man of family, and con&s;equently for Mortimer Delvile he is no companion. If you can render him any &s;ervice, I &s;hall commend your &s;o do|ing; it becomes your birth, it becomes your &s;tation in life to a&s;&s;i&s;t individuals, and promote the general good; but never in your zeal for others forget what is due to your&s;elf, and to the ancient and honourable hou&s;e from which you are &s;prung."</Q></P>

<Q REND="inline">"But can we entertain Mi&s;s Beverley with nothing better than family lectures?"</Q> cried Mrs. Delvile.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is for me,"</Q> &s;aid young Delvile, ri&s;ing, <Q REND="inline">"to beg pardon of Mi&s;s Beverley for hav|ing occa&s;ioned them: but when &s;he is &s;o good as to honour us with her company again, I hope I &s;hall have more di&s;cre|tion."</Q></P>
<P>He then left the room; and Mr. Del|vile al&s;o ri&s;ing to go, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My dear, I commit you to very kind hands; Mrs. Del|vile, I am &s;ure, will be happy to hear your &s;tory, &s;peak to her, therefore, without re|&s;erve. And pray don't imagine that I make you over to her from any &s;light; on the contrary, I admire and commend your mode&s;ty very much; but my time is ex|tremely precious, and I cannot devote &s;o much of it to an explanation as your diffi|dence requires."</Q></P>
<P>And then, to the great joy of Cecilia, he retired; leaving her much in doubt whe|ther his haughtine&s;s or his conde&s;cen&s;ion humbled her mo&s;t,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The&s;e men,"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"can never comprehend the pain of a delicate female mind upon entering into explana|tions of this &s;ort: I under&s;tand it, how|ever, too well to inflict it. We will, there|fore, have no explanations at all till we

<P><Q REND="inline">"You do me, madam, much honour,"</Q> an&s;wered Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"but I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure you I have no explanation to give."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, well, at pre&s;ent,"</Q> returned Mrs. Delvile, <Q REND="inline">"I am content to hear that an|&s;wer, as I have acquired no right to any other: but hereafter I &s;hall hope for more openne&s;s: it is promi&s;ed me by your coun|tenance, and I mean to claim the promi&s;e by my friend&s;hip."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your friend&s;hip will both honour and delight me, and whatever are your en|quiries, I &s;hall always be proud to an&s;wer them; but indeed, with regard to this af|fair&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear Mi&s;s Beverley,"</Q> interrupted Mrs. Delvile, with a look of arch incredu|lity, <Q REND="inline">"men &s;eldom ri&s;k their lives where an e&s;cape is without hope of recompence. But we will not now &s;ay a word more upon the &s;ubject. I hope you will often favour me with your company, and by the fre|quency of your vi&s;its, make us both forget the &s;hortne&s;s of our acquaintance."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia, finding her re&s;i&s;tance only gave birth to fre&s;h &s;u&s;picion, now yielded, &s;atis|fied
<PB N="274" REF="274">
that a very little time mu&s;t unavoidably clear up the truth. But her vi&s;it was not therefore &s;hortened; the &s;udden partiality with which the figure and countenance of Mrs. Delvile had impre&s;&s;ed her, was quickly ripened into e&s;teem by the charms of her conver&s;ation: &s;he found her &s;en&s;ible, well bred, and high &s;pirited, gifted by na|ture with &s;uperior talents, and poli&s;hed by education and &s;tudy with all the elegant embelli&s;hments of cultivation. She &s;aw in her, indeed, &s;ome portion of the pride &s;he had been taught to expect, but it was &s;o much &s;oftened by elegance, and &s;o well tempered with kindne&s;s, that it elevated her character, without rendering her manners offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>With &s;uch a woman, &s;ubjects of di&s;cour&s;e could never be wanting, nor fertility of powers to make them entertaining: and &s;o much was Cecilia delighted with her vi&s;it, that though her carriage was announced at twelve o'clock, &s;he reluctantly concluded it at two; and in taking her leave, gladly ac|cepted an invitation to dine with her new friend three days after; who, equally plea&s;ed with her young gue&s;t, promi&s;ed be|fore that time to return her vi&s;it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. AN EXAMINATION.</HEAD>
<P>CECILIA found Mrs. Harrel eagerly waiting to hear &s;ome account how &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the morning, and fully per|&s;uaded that &s;he would leave the Delviles with a determination never more, but by nece&s;&s;ity, to &s;ee them: &s;he was, therefore, not only &s;urpri&s;ed but di&s;appointed, when in&s;tead of fulfilling her expectations, &s;he a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he had been delighted with Mrs. Delvile, who&s;e engaging quali|ties amply recompen&s;ed her for the arro|gance of her hu&s;band; that her vi&s;it had no fault but that of being too &s;hort, and that &s;he had already appointed an early day for repeating it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harrel was evidently hurt by this prai&s;e, and Cecilia, who perceived among all her guardians a powerful di&s;po&s;ition to hatred and jealou&s;y, &s;oon dropt the &s;ubject: though &s;o much had &s;he been charmed with Mrs. Delvile, that a &s;cheme of removal once more occurred to her, notwith&s;tanding her di&s;like of her &s;tately guardian.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="276">
At dinner, as u&s;ual, they were joined by Sir Robert Floyer, who grew more and more a&s;&s;iduous in his attendance, but who, this day, contrary to his general cu&s;tom of remaining with the gentlemen, made his exit before the ladies left the table; and as &s;oon as he was gone, Mr. Harrel de&s;ired a private conference with Cecilia.</P>
<P>They went together to the drawing-room, where, after a flouri&s;hing preface upon the merits of Sir Robert Floyer, he formally acquainted her that he was commi&s;&s;ioned by that gentleman, to make her a tender of his hand and fortune.</P>
<P>Cecilia, who had not much rea&s;on to be &s;urpri&s;ed at this overture, de&s;ired him to tell the Baronet, &s;he was obliged to him for the honour he intended her, at the &s;ame time that &s;he ab&s;olutely declined receiv|ing it.</P>
<P>Mr. Harrel, laughing, told her this an|&s;wer was very well for a beginning, though it would by no means &s;erve beyond the fir&s;t day of the declaration; but when Cecilia a&s;&s;ured him &s;he &s;hould firmly adhere to it, he remon&s;trated with equal &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;|content upon the rea&s;ons of her refu&s;al. She thought it &s;ufficient to tell him that Sir Robert did not plea&s;e her, but, with much raillery, he denied the a&s;&s;ertion credit, a&s;&s;uring her that he was univer&s;ally admired by the
<PB N="277" REF="277">
ladies, that &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly receive a more honourable offer, and that he was reck|oned by every body the fine&s;t gentleman about the town. His fortune, he added, was equally unexceptionable with his figure and his rank in life; all the world, he was certain, would approve the connexion, and the &s;et|tlement made upon her &s;hould be dictated by her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Cecilia begged him to be &s;atisfied with an an&s;wer which &s;he never could change, and to &s;pare her the enumeration of parti|cular objections, &s;ince Sir Robert was wholly and in every re&s;pect di&s;agreeable to her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What, then,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"could make you &s;o frightened for him at the Opera|hou&s;e? There has been but one opinion about town ever &s;ince of your prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am extremely concerned to hear it; my fright was but the effect of &s;urpri&s;e, and belonged not more to Sir Robert than to Mr. Belfield."</Q></P>
<P>He told her that nobody el&s;e thought the &s;ame, that her marriage with the Baronet was univer&s;ally expected, and, in conclu|&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding her earne&s;t de&s;ire that he would in&s;tantly and explicitly in|form Sir Robert of her determination, he repeatedly refu&s;ed to give him any final an|&s;wer
<PB N="278" REF="278">
till &s;he had taken more time for con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Cecilia was extremely di&s;plea&s;ed at this irk&s;ome importunity, and &s;till more cha|grined to find her incautious emotion at the Opera-hou&s;e, had given ri&s;e to &s;u&s;picions of her harbouring a partiality for a man whom every day &s;he more heartily di&s;liked.</P>
<P>While &s;he was deliberating in what man|ner &s;he could clear up this mi&s;take, which, after &s;he was left alone, occupied all her thoughts, &s;he was interrupted by the en|trance of Mr. Monckton, who&s;e joy in meeting her at length by her&s;elf exceeded not her own, for charmed as he was that he could now examine into the &s;tate of her af|fairs, &s;he was not le&s;s delighted that &s;he could make them known to him.</P>
<P>After mutual expre&s;&s;ions, guarded, how|ever, on the part of Mr. Monckton, though unre&s;erved on that of Cecilia, of their &s;atisfaction in being again able to conver&s;e as in former times, he a&s;ked if &s;he would permit him, as the privilege of their long acquaintance, to &s;peak to her with &s;in|cerity.</P>
<P>She a&s;&s;ured him he could not more oblige her.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let me, then,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"enquire if yet that ardent confidence in your own &s;teadine&s;s, which &s;o much di&s;dained my
<PB N="279" REF="279">
fears that the change of your re&s;idence might produce a change in your &s;entiments, is &s;till as un&s;haken as when we parted in Suffolk? Or whether experience, that foe to unpracti&s;ed refinement, has already taught you the fallibility of theory?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When I a&s;&s;ure you,"</Q> replied Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"that your enquiry gives me no pain, I think I have &s;ufficiently an&s;wered it, for were I con&s;cious of any alteration, it could not but embarra&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s me. Very far, however, from finding my&s;elf in the danger with which you threatened me, of <HI>forgetting Bury, its inhabitants and its environs,</HI> I think with plea&s;ure of little el&s;e, &s;ince Lon|don, in&s;tead of bewitching, has greatly di&s;appointed me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How &s;o?"</Q> cried Mr. Monckton, much delighted.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not,"</Q> an&s;wered &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"in it&s;elf, not in its magnificence, nor in its diver&s;ions, which &s;eem to be inexhau&s;tible; but the&s;e, though copious as in&s;truments of plea&s;ure, are very &s;hallow as &s;ources of happine&s;s: the di&s;appointment, therefore, comes nearer home, and &s;prings not from London, but from my own &s;ituation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is that, then, di&s;agreeable to you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;hall your&s;elf judge, when I have told you that from the time of my quitting your hou&s;e till this very moment, when I
<PB N="280" REF="280">
have again the happine&s;s of talking with you, I have never once had any conver&s;a|tion, &s;ociety or intercour&s;e, in which friend|&s;hip or affection have had any &s;hare, or my mind has had the lea&s;t intere&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>She then entered into a detail of her way of life, told him how little &s;uited to her ta&s;te was the unbounded di&s;&s;ipation of the Harrels, and feelingly expatiated upon the di&s;appointment &s;he had received from the alteration in the manner and conduct of her young friend. <Q REND="inline">"In her,"</Q> &s;he con|tinued, <Q REND="inline">"had I found the companion I came prepared to meet, the companion from whom I had &s;o lately parted, and in who&s;e &s;ociety I expected to find con&s;olation for the lo&s;s of yours and of Mrs. Charlton's, I &s;hould have complained of nothing; the very places that now tire, might then have entertained me, and all that now pa&s;&s;es for unmeaning di&s;&s;ipation, might then have worn the appearance of variety and plea|&s;ure. But where the mind is wholly with|out intere&s;t, every thing is languid and in|&s;ipid; and accu&s;tomed as I have long been to think friend&s;hip the fir&s;t of human ble&s;|&s;ings, and &s;ocial conver&s;e the greate&s;t of hu|man enjoyments, how ever can I reconcile my&s;elf to a &s;tate of carele&s;s indifference, to making acquaintance without any concern either for pre&s;erving or e&s;teeming them, and
<PB N="281" REF="281">
to going on from day to day in an eager &s;earch of amu&s;ement, with no companion for the hours of retirement, and no view beyond that of pa&s;&s;ing the pre&s;ent moment in apparent gaiety and thoughtle&s;sne&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Monckton, who heard the&s;e com|plaints with &s;ecret rapture, far from &s;eek|ing to &s;often or remove, u&s;ed his utmo&s;t en|deavours to &s;trengthen and encrea&s;e them, by artfully retracing her former way of life, and pointing out with added cen&s;ures the change in it &s;he had been lately compelled to make: <Q REND="inline">"a change,"</Q> he continued, <Q REND="inline">"which though ruinous of your time, and detrimental to your happine&s;s, u&s;e will, I fear, familiarize, and familiarity render plea&s;ant."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The&s;e &s;u&s;picions, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"mortify me greatly; and why, when far from finding me plea&s;ed, you hear nothing but repining, &s;hould you &s;till continue to harbour them?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e your trial has yet been too &s;hort to prove your firmne&s;s, and becau&s;e there is nothing to which time cannot con|tentedly accu&s;tom us."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I feel not much fear,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"of &s;tanding &s;uch a te&s;t as might fully &s;a|tisfy you; but neverthele&s;s, not to be too pre&s;umptuous, I have by no means expo&s;ed my&s;elf to all the dangers which you think
<PB N="282" REF="282">
&s;urround me, for of late I have &s;pent almo&s;t every evening at home and by my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>This intelligence was to Mr. Monckton a &s;urpri&s;e the mo&s;t agreeable he could re|ceive. Her di&s;ta&s;te for the amu&s;ements which were offered her greatly relieved his fears of her forming any alarming connec|tion, and the di&s;covery that while &s;o anxi|ou&s;ly he had &s;ought her every where in pub|lic, &s;he had quietly pa&s;&s;ed her time by her own fire-&s;ide, not only re-a&s;&s;ured him for the pre&s;ent, but gave him information where he might meet with her in future.</P>
<P>He then talked of the duel, and &s;olicit|ou&s;ly led her to &s;peak open of Sir Robert Floyer; and here too, his &s;atisfaction was entire; he found her di&s;like of him &s;uch as his knowledge of her di&s;po&s;ition made him expect, and &s;he wholly removed his &s;u&s;|picions concerning her anxiety about the quarrel, by explaining to him her appre|hen&s;ions of having occa&s;ioned it her&s;elf, from accepting the civility of Mr. Belfield, at the very moment &s;he &s;hewed her aver&s;ion to receiving that of Sir Robert.</P>
<P>Neither did her confidence re&s;t here; &s;he acquainted him with the conver&s;ation &s;he had ju&s;t had with Mr. Harrel, and begged his advice in what manner &s;he might &s;ecure her&s;elf from further importunity.</P>
<P>Mr. Monckton had now a new &s;ubject
<PB N="283" REF="283">
for his di&s;cernment. Every thing had con|firmed to him the pa&s;&s;ion which Mr. Arnott had conceived for Cecilia, and he had therefore concluded the intere&s;t of the Har|rels would be all in his favour: other ideas now &s;truck him; he found that Mr. Arnott was given up for Sir Robert, and he deter|mined carefully to watch the motions both of the Baronet and her young guardian, in order to di&s;cover the nature of their plans and connexion. Mean time, convinced by her unaffected aver&s;ion to the propo&s;als &s;he had received, that &s;he was at pre&s;ent in no danger from the league he &s;u&s;pected, he merely advi&s;ed her to per&s;evere in manife&s;t|ing a calm repugnance to their &s;olicitations, which could not fail, before long, to di&s;|hearten them both.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But Sir,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I now fear this man as much as I di&s;like him, for his late fiercene&s;s and brutality, though they have encrea&s;ed my di&s;gu&s;t, make me dread to &s;hew it. I am impatient, therefore, to have done with him, and to &s;ee him no more. And for this purpo&s;e, I wi&s;h to quit the hou&s;e of Mr. Harrel, where he has ac|ce&s;s at his plea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You can wi&s;h nothing more judici|ou&s;ly,"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"would you, then, return into the country?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That is not yet in my power; I am
<PB N="284" REF="284">
obliged to re&s;ide with one of my guardians. To day I have &s;een Mrs. Delvile, and &mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Delvile?"</Q> interrupted Mr. Monckton, in a voice of a&s;toni&s;hment, <Q REND="inline">"Surely you do not think of removing in|to that family?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What can I do &s;o well? Mrs. Delvile is a charming woman, and her conver&s;ation would afford me more entertainment and in&s;truction in a &s;ingle day, than under this roof I &s;hould obtain in a twelvemonth."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are you &s;erious? Do you really think of making &s;uch a change?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I really wi&s;h it, but I know not yet if it is practicable: on Thur&s;day, however, I am to dine with her, and then, if it is in my power, I will hint to her my de&s;ire."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And can Mi&s;s Beverley po&s;&s;ibly wi&s;h,"</Q> cried Mr. Monckton with earne&s;tne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"to re&s;ide in &s;uch a hou&s;e? Is not Mr. Delvile the mo&s;t o&s;tentatious, haughty, and &s;elf|&s;ufficient of men? Is not his wife the proud|e&s;t of women? And is not the whole family odious to all the world?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You amaze me!"</Q> cried Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"&s;urely that cannot be their general cha|racter? Mr. Delvile, indeed, de&s;erves all the cen&s;ure he can meet for his weari&s;ome parade of &s;uperiority; but his lady by no means merits to be included in the &s;ame re|proach. I have &s;pent this whole morning
<PB N="285" REF="285">
with her, and though I waited upon her with a &s;trong prejudice in her disfavour, I ob&s;erved in her no pride that exceeded the bounds of propriety and native dignity."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Have you often been at the hou&s;e? Do you know the &s;on, too?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have &s;een him three or four times."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what do you think of him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hardly know enough of him to judge fairly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But what does he &s;eem to you? Do you not perceive in him already all the ar|rogance, all the contemptuous in&s;olence of his father?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O no! far from it indeed; his mind &s;eems to be liberal and noble, open to im|pre&s;&s;ions of merit, and eager to honour and promote it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are much deceived; you have been reading your own mind, and thought you had read his: I would advi&s;e you &s;e|dulou&s;ly to avoid the whole family; you will find all intercour&s;e with them irk&s;ome and comfortle&s;s: &s;uch as the father appears at once, the wife and the &s;on will, in a few more meetings, appear al&s;o. They are de|&s;cended from the &s;ame &s;tock, and inherit the &s;ame &s;elf-complacency. Mr. Delvile married his cou&s;in, and each of them in&s;ti|gates the other to believe that all birth and rank would be at an end in the world, if their own &s;uperb family had not a promi&s;e
<PB N="286" REF="286">
of &s;upport from their hopeful Mortimer. Should you precipitately &s;ettle your&s;elf in their hou&s;e, you would very &s;oon be to|tally weighed down by their united in|&s;olence."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia again and warmly attempted to defend them; but Mr. Monckton was &s;o po&s;itive in his a&s;&s;ertions, and &s;o &s;ignificant in his in&s;inuations to their di&s;credit, that &s;he was at length per&s;uaded &s;he had judged too ha&s;tily, and, after thanking him for his coun&s;el, promi&s;ed not to take any mea&s;ures towards a removal without his advice.</P>
<P>This was all he de&s;ired; and now, en|livened by finding that his influence with her was unimpaired, and that her heart was yet her own, he cea&s;ed his exhortations, and turned the di&s;cour&s;e to &s;ubjects more gay and general, judiciou&s;ly cautious neither by tedious admonitions to di&s;gu&s;t, nor by fretful &s;olicitude to alarm her. He did not quit her till the evening was far ad|vanced, and then, in returning to his own hou&s;e, felt all his anxieties and di&s;appoint|ments recompen&s;ed by the comfort this long and &s;atisfactory conver&s;ation had afforded him. While Cecilia, charmed with hav|ing &s;pent the morning with her new ac|quaintance, and the evening with her old friend, retired to re&s;t better plea&s;ed with the di&s;po&s;al of her time than &s;he had yet been &s;ince her journey from Suffolk.</P>

<P>THE two following days had neither event nor di&s;turbance, except &s;ome little vexation occa&s;ioned by the behaviour of Sir Robert Floyer, who &s;till appeared not to entertain any doubt of the &s;ucce&s;s of his addre&s;&s;es. This impertinent confidence &s;he could only attribute to the officious en|couragement of Mr. Harrel, and therefore &s;he determined rather to &s;eek than to avoid an explanation with him.

<P>On Thur&s;day, according to her appoint|ment, &s;he again went to St. James'-Square, and being &s;hewn into the drawing-room till dinner was ready, found there only young Mr. Delvile.</P>
<P>After &s;ome general conver&s;ation, he a&s;ked her how lately &s;he had had any news of Mr. Belfield?</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="288">
<Q REND="inline">"This morning,"</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"when I had the plea&s;ure of hearing he was quite recovered. Have you &s;een him again, Sir?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, madam, twice."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And did you think him almo&s;t well?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I thought,"</Q> an&s;wered he, with &s;ome he&s;itation, <Q REND="inline">and I think &s;till, that your en|quiries ought to be his cure."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O,"</Q> cried Cecilia, <Q REND="inline">"I hope he has far better medicines: but I am afraid I have been mi&s;informed, for I &s;ee you do not think him better."</Q></P>

are &s;o medicinal, pray in&s;truct me how to admini&s;ter them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t order him to give up, for the pre&s;ent, his plan of going into the coun|try, where he can have no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and where his wound mu&s;t be dre&s;&s;ed only by a common &s;ervant, and to remain quietly in town till his &s;urgeon pronounces that he may travel without any hazard."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But is he, &s;eriou&s;ly, &s;o mad as to intend leaving town without the con&s;ent of his &s;urgeon?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing le&s;s than &s;uch an intention could have induced me to undeceive you with re&s;pect to his recovery. But indeed I am no friend to tho&s;e artifices which pur|cha&s;e pre&s;ent relief by future mi&s;ery: I ven|ture, therefore, to &s;peak to you the &s;imple truth, that by a timely exertion of your in|fluence you may prevent further evil."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know not, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia, with the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"why you &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e I have any &s;uch influence; nor can I imagine that any deception has been prac|ticed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is po&s;&s;ible,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"I may have been too much alarmed; but in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this, no information ought to be de|pended upon but that of his &s;urgeon. You, madam, may probably know his opinion?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="290">
<Q REND="inline">"Me?&mdash;No, indeed! I never &s;aw his &s;urgeon; I know not even who he is."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I purpo&s;e calling upon him to-morrow morning; will Mi&s;s Beverley permit me af|terwards the honour of communicating to her what may pa&s;s?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I thank you, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, colouring very high; <Q REND="inline">"but my impatience is by no means &s;o great as to occa&s;ion my giving you that trouble."</Q></P>
<P>Delvile, perceiving her change of coun|tenance, in&s;tantly, and with much re&s;pect, entreated her pardon for the propo&s;al; which, however, &s;he had no &s;ooner granted, than he &s;aid very archly <Q REND="inline">"Why indeed you have not much right to be angry, &s;ince it was your own frankne&s;s that excited mine. And thus, you find, like mo&s;t other cul|prits, I am ready to ca&s;t the blame of the offence upon the offended. I feel, how|ever, an irre&s;i&s;tible propen&s;ity to do &s;ervice to Mr. Belfield;&mdash;&s;hall I &s;in quite beyond forgivene&s;s if I venture to tell you how I found him &s;ituated this morning?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, certainly,&mdash;if you wi&s;h it, I can have no objection."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I found him, then, &s;urrounded by a &s;et of gay young men, who, by way of keeping up his &s;pirits, made him laugh and talk without cea&s;ing: he a&s;&s;ured me him&s;elf that he was perfectly well, and intended to
<PB N="291" REF="291">
gallop out of town to-morrow morning; though, when I &s;hook hands with him at parting, I was both &s;hocked and alarmed to feel by the burning heat of the &s;kin, that far from di&s;carding his &s;urgeon, he ought rather to call in a phy&s;ician."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am very much concerned to hear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s account,"</Q> &s;aid Cecilia; <Q REND="inline">"but I do not well under&s;tand what you mean &s;hould on my part follow it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That,"</Q> an&s;wered he, bowing, with a look of mock gravity, <Q REND="inline">"I pretend not to &s;ettle! In &s;tating the ca&s;e I have &s;atisfied my con&s;cience, and if in hearing it you can pardon the liberty I have taken, I &s;hall as much honour the openne&s;s of your cha|racter, as I admire that of your coun|tenance."</Q></P>
<P>Cecilia now, to her no little a&s;toni&s;h|ment, found &s;he had the &s;ame mi&s;take to clear up at pre&s;ent concerning Mr. Belfield, that only three days before &s;he had ex|plained with re&s;pect to the Baronet. But &s;he had no time to &s;peak further upon the &s;ubject, as the entrance of Mrs. Delvile put an end to their di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>That lady received her with the mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hing kindne&s;s; apologi&s;ed for not &s;ooner waiting upon her, and repeatedly declared that nothing but indi&s;po&s;ition
<PB N="292" REF="292">
&s;hould have prevented her returning the fa|vour of her fir&s;t vi&s;it.</P>
<P>They were &s;oon after &s;ummoned to din|ner. Mr. Delvile, to the infinite joy of Cecilia, was out.</P>
<P>The day was &s;pent greatly to her &s;atisfac|tion. There was no interruption from vi|&s;itors, &s;he was tormented by the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of no di&s;agreeable &s;ubjects, the duel was not mentioned, the antagoni&s;ts were not hinted at, &s;he was teized with no &s;elf-&s;uf|ficient encouragement, and wearied with no mortifying affability; the conver&s;ation at once was lively and rational, and though general, was rendered intere&s;ting, by a reci|procation of good-will and plea&s;ure in the conver&s;ers.</P>
<P>The favourable opinion &s;he had con|ceived both of the mother and the &s;on this long vi&s;it &s;erved to confirm: in Mrs. Del|vile &s;he found &s;trong &s;en&s;e, quick parts, and high breeding; in Mortimer, &s;incerity and vivacity joined with &s;oftne&s;s and elegance; and in both there &s;eemed the mo&s;t liberal admiration of talents, with an openne&s;s of heart that di&s;dained all di&s;gui&s;e. Greatly plea&s;ed with their manners, and &s;truck with all that was apparent in their characters, &s;he much regretted the prejudice of Mr. Monckton, which now, with the promi&s;e &s;he had given him, was all that oppo&s;ed her
<PB N="293" REF="293">
making an immediate effort towards a change in her abode.</P>
<P>She did not take her leave till eleven o'clock, when Mrs. Delvile, after repeat|edly thanking her for her vi&s;it, &s;aid &s;he would not &s;o much encroach upon her good nature as to reque&s;t another till &s;he had waited upon her in return; but added, that &s;he meant very &s;peedily to pay that debt, in order to enable her&s;elf, by friendly and fre|quent meetings, to enter upon the confi|dential commi&s;&s;ion with which her guardian had entru&s;ted her.</P>
<P>Cecilia was plea&s;ed with the delicacy which gave ri&s;e to this forbearance, yet having in fact nothing either to relate or conceal, &s;he was rather &s;orry than glad at the delay of an explanation, &s;ince &s;he found the whole family was in an error with re|&s;pect to the &s;ituation of her affairs.</P>
