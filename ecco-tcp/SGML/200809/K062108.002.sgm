<P>me no matter for ob&s;ervation, either of prai&s;e or cen&s;ure, and con&s;equently no|thing for your entertainment. They are neither hand&s;ome nor ugly, witty nor fooli&s;h, aukward nor well-bred; they are in that cla&s;s of mediocrity which leaves one nothing to &s;ay, but that they are good &s;ort of people. However, there was another lady expected, who, I &s;uppo&s;ed, had &s;ome claim to di&s;tinction; for upon the mention of Lady Jack&s;on, every one had &s;omething to &s;ay of her. 'She was at church la&s;t Sunday,' &s;aid one lady, <Q>quite new dre&s;&s;ed in her fourth mourning, that is, for the la&s;t quarter, you know, and looked mighty well.</Q> <Q>To be &s;ure, &s;he is a very <HI>per|&s;onable</HI> woman,</Q> &s;aid another, <Q>and has a fine pre&s;ence: but any one would look well, dre&s;&s;ed to &s;uch advantage as &s;he is; I dare &s;ay, &s;he had not le&s;s than twenty pounds value of gauzes, and blonds, and feathers about her.</Q> <Q>Aye, &s;he had plenty of white plumes on her head,</Q> &s;aid a third lady. <Q>I &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="3" REF="3">
it is the fa&s;hion in London to wear &s;o many; for Lady Jack&s;on would rather be dead than out of the fa&s;hion: and they &s;ay, indeed, &s;he &s;pends two|thirds of her income in clothes, though &s;he is not young, and never was hand|&s;ome; and, to my thinking, that prodigious quantity of feathers &s;he wears is very frightful; for when &s;he came into church, being a very tall woman, and walking through the crowd, &s;he overtopped every body, and her white plumes, nodding as &s;he moved, appeared like tho&s;e carried before the hear&s;e of &s;ome batchelor or maid in a funeral.</Q></P>
<P>EVERY one laughed at this conceit; and Mr. Greville happening to &s;it near me, I a&s;ked him, in a low voice, <Q>who is this Lady Jack&s;on?</Q> <Q>She is the widow of a rich citizen,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>who was knighted in the la&s;t promotion of bob-wigs and laced wai&s;tcoats. The lady &s;o little under&s;tands this honour,
<PB N="4" REF="4">
&s;o envied by every alderman's wife in London, that &s;he thinks it equals her with a counte&s;s; and if &s;he knew how, &s;he would a&s;&s;ume the dignified manners of quality, as well as their dre&s;s; but her breeding is coar&s;e, and her oppor|tunities of improvement few. One leading card in her character I cannot pa&s;s over; it is her in&s;uperable vanity, which makes her imagine that every man who looks upon her is in love with her. No maiden can be &s;ecure of the con&s;tancy of her lover, no wife of the fidelity of her hu&s;band, if Lady Jack&s;on comes in the way. This folly of hers is &s;o apparent, that it draws a great deal of ridicule upon her from the men, who feed it with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t flattery, which &s;he &s;wallows as greedily as if&mdash;as Shak&s;peare &s;ays,
<Q><L>Her appetite grew with what it fed on.</L></Q>
But it is not only to the prai&s;e of beauty &s;he a&s;pires; &s;he unites, if you believe her profe&s;&s;ions, every amiable
<PB N="5" REF="5">
quality in her mind, as well as every grace in her per&s;on. She is far gone in the refinements of friend&s;hip; &s;he ta&s;tes, with the highe&s;t reli&s;h, the lux|ury of benevolence; while her in&s;in|cerity incapacitates her for the one, and her &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s for the other.</Q></P>
<P>'It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed,' &s;aid I, <Q>that you are going to introduce me to a very valuable acquaintance.</Q> <Q>I could not avoid inviting her,</Q> replied he, <Q>as &s;he is upon a vi&s;it to a lady in the neighbourhood, who is my intimate friend; be&s;ides, I am fond of extra|ordinary characters. I have given you but the bare outlines of Lady Jack|&s;on's; the lady will fini&s;h the picture her&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>I WAS obliged, however, to wait &s;ome time longer for this &s;atisfaction; and dinner was ready to be &s;erved, before Lady Jack&s;on came; doubtle&s;s, this delay was an effect of the &s;ame policy,
<PB N="6" REF="6">
which makes our celebrated beauties enter the church and the play-hou&s;e, when the &s;ervice is half over in the for|mer, and the &s;econd act of the comedy begun in the latter.</P>
<P>At length Lady Jack&s;on was an|nounced; &s;he entered the room with a ma&s;culine &s;tep, and &s;uch an air of con|fidence in the &s;uperiority of her charms and her dre&s;s, as at the fir&s;t moment in&s;pired me with di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. GREVILLE, who knew that din|ner only waited for her, led her imme|diately into the dining-hall, expre&s;&s;ing his concern, by the way, that Mrs. Derwent did not accompany her. Lady Jack&s;on told him, that Mrs. Derwent was &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed, that &s;he could not venture abroad, and that &s;he had &s;at by her bed-&s;ide, in great unea&s;ine&s;s, all the morning. This was the fir&s;t time I had heard her voice, which is loud and har&s;h; and &s;o little did her countenance
<PB N="7" REF="7">
expre&s;s the &s;en&s;ibility &s;he would be thought to po&s;&s;e&s;s, that her mouth was &s;crewed up into an affected &s;imper, while her eyes were fixed upon the large gla&s;s that fronted the door by which &s;he en|tered, and &s;hewed her her figure at full length. This &s;ight had the force of magic, and &s;eemed to have rivetted her feet to the &s;pot where &s;he &s;tood; when Mr. Greville, by a gentle violence, led her to her &s;eat at the table, which was on my right hand. She &s;oon entered into a particular conver&s;ation with me; admired the elegance of my undre&s;s; a&s;ked who was my millener, and how much my lace co&s;t a yard; and, in a de|ci&s;ive tone, a&s;&s;ured me every thing I had on was perfectly fa&s;hionable.</P>
<P>AFTER dinner, when we were got back to the drawing-room, being &s;till &s;eated near me, &s;he renewed the di&s;|cour&s;e; and making a &s;udden tran&s;i|tion from the trimming of gowns, to which &s;he conde&s;cended to a&s;k my opi|nion
<PB N="8" REF="8">
of, &s;he talked of books; ran over the names of Milton, Shake&s;peare, Dry|den, Pope:&mdash;But her ob&s;ervations and critici&s;ms were confined to exclamations of&mdash;excellent! divine! inimitable! which &s;he uttered with great vehemence; while &s;he entered more deeply into the merits of Mariveaux and Marmontel; the cha|racters of the former were &s;o natural&mdash;the tales of the latter &s;o charming&mdash;&s;o intere&s;ting! This flow of erudition was &s;topped by the attention the company &s;eemed willing to give, to a lady who was relating to the per&s;on that &s;at next her, a melancholy accident which had happened to an acquaintance of her's&mdash;a gentleman who was killed by a fall from his hor&s;e, and brought home dead to his wife a few hours after he had left her in high health and &s;pirits. The wretched wife was &s;ei&s;ed with convul|&s;ions at the &s;ight, and died the next day.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9">LADY JACKSON, being a widow her|&s;elf, it was her part to be more affected than any one el&s;e with this &s;ad &s;tory : &s;he &s;ighed aloud. My uncle ob&s;erved, that &s;uch in&s;tances of conjugal affection were very rare.</P>
<P>'Very rare indeed,' &s;aid Mr. Gre|ville; <Q>for one &s;uch afflicted widow, we &s;hall &s;ee a hundred, who, as Pope, one of your admired authors, Madam,</Q> &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Lady Jack|&s;on, 'has it,

<L>To midnight dances, and the public &s;hew.</L></Q></P>
<P>'Oh, dear Sir,' &s;aid Lady Jack&s;on, 'you are very fevere.'</P>
<P>'Not at all, Madam,' &s;aid he, <Q>for although my cen&s;ures are general, I admit of &s;ome exceptions. But, to &s;peak the truth, there is no virtue now &s;o common as fortitude, nor any thing
<PB N="10" REF="10">
&s;o &s;uperfluous as the cu&s;tom of com|forting. All the poi&s;ons of The&s;&s;aly might &s;afely be tru&s;ted in the hands of the mourners of our time.</Q></P>
<P>'I HOPE, Sir,' &s;aid Lady Jack&s;on, <Q>you include the male mourners in this ob&s;ervation.</Q></P>
<P>'CERTAINLY, Madam,' &s;aid Mr. Greville, <Q>there are men, I believe, who would be glad to outlive, not only their friends and relations, but even the age they live in, and their very country; and rather than die, would willingly &s;tay in the world alone.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I AM &s;ure there is no woman of that mind,</Q> &s;aid Lady Jack&s;on.</P>
<P>'For a very good rea&s;on, Madam,' &s;aid Mr. Greville; <Q>there would be no|body to admire her.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="11">'You are a perfect cynic,' replied the Lady, gravely; and ri&s;ing, walked up to a window, from which there was a pro&s;pect of a very fine flower|garden, which &s;he commended greatly. Mr. Greville a&s;&s;ured her, it was part of his bu&s;ine&s;s every morning to dre&s;s that garden. 'For,' added he, <Q>I am a great admirer of beauty, wherever I meet it: but becau&s;e it is a dangerous thing in women's faces, I had rather contemplate it in the&s;e flowers.</Q></P>
<P>LADY JACKSON, who has, it &s;eems, a very happy facility in appropriating the&s;e &s;ort of &s;peeches to her&s;elf, imme|diately changed her manner; &s;he be|came lively, witty, good-humoured; but her vivacity &s;hewed it&s;elf in boi&s;ter|ous laughs at a je&s;t of her own finding out; her wit, in &s;craps of poetry quoted at random; and her good-hu|mour, in familiar nods, &s;miles, indeli|cate prai&s;e, and taps on the &s;houlder,
<PB N="12" REF="12">
rather heavy indeed, for the hand that gave them was robu&s;t, and the manner truly ma&s;culine.</P>
<P>MR. Greville kept up the &s;cene &s;o long, that the lady departed in full per|&s;ua&s;ion that &s;he had made a conque&s;t; and this notion of her's afforded my uncle &s;ome diver&s;ion; but I was con|cerned that her folly had been &s;oothed &s;o agreeably; for if happine&s;s be but opinion, Mr. Greville had made her happy; and what was this but to re|ward and continue folly?</P>
<P>I WAS malicious enough to wi&s;h &s;he had been a &s;ecret witne&s;s of the ridicule ca&s;t upon her by the very man whom &s;he imagined was beginning to feel the influ|ence of her charms. But enough, and indeed too much of this lady; if it were not that &s;he has earne&s;tly reque&s;ted me to make her the bearer of a letter to you, who&s;e character &s;he profe&s;&s;es to be an idolater of. She &s;ays &s;he has &s;ome

relations in New York, who by their &s;tation and connections may be of u&s;e to Mr. Neville; and this being confirmed to me by Mr. Greville, &s;he will have the happine&s;s to pre&s;ent this letter to you. Oh! envied happine&s;s! could &s;he ta&s;te it&mdash;but that is impo&s;&s;ible, for minds like your's and her's can never mix. Adieu! my dear Euphemia.</P>

<HEAD>MISS HARLEY TO MRS. NEVILLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR EUPHEMIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>By this time you have received my la&s;t letter, which Lady Jack&s;on, tran&s;ported with the opportunity it gave her of being acquainted with you, pro|mi&s;ed to deliver to you her&s;elf. I am impatient till you give me an account of your interview; I am &s;ure you will be diverted with her peculiarities; for you only &s;mile at follies which make me peevi&s;h.</P>
<P>I HAVE been &s;urpri&s;ed with a letter from Mr. Harley; a country fellow gave it to my maid. She a&s;ked if it re|quired an an&s;wer; he &s;aid he had no orders about that, but he would wait.</P>

<P>LOW as my fortunes are, I never till now laboured under the weight of pecuniary obligations. But can any thing be humiliating that comes from you? Oh! why was this &s;oft atten|tion to my &s;ituation &s;hewn me at a time when my rea&s;on was &s;till free enough to combat tho&s;e &s;entiments which the fir&s;t &s;ight of you in&s;pired. Sentiments, which the implacability of your uncle, and a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of my own unworthine&s;s, convinced me I ought to &s;uppre&s;s&mdash;I ought, it is true, but I never can &s;uppre&s;s them: and all I dare to hope for from your goodne&s;s is, that you will pardon the boldne&s;s

<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your devoted &s;ervant, EDWARD HARLEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>WELL, my dear Euphemia, what do you think of this letter? is there not &s;omething extremely affecting in the manner in which this young man &s;peaks of his &s;ituation? He is humble without meanne&s;s, and dignifies poverty by the noblene&s;s of his &s;entiments. Dearly as I love my uncle, grateful as my heart is for his genero&s;ity to me, I mu&s;t blame him a little for the implacability of his temper (as Mr. Harley calls it), which hinders him from di&s;tingui&s;hing between the guilty and the innocent, and makes him &s;uffer the heir of his ho|nour and fortunes to langui&s;h in indi|gence and ob&s;curity.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">You will readily allow that I was un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of an&s;wering this letter, which I certainly &s;hould not have done had it contained only a declaration of love: but it was ju&s;t to &s;et him right with regard to the pecuniary obligation, as he con&s;iders it. Here then is what I wrote.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MR. HARLEY,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was by my uncle's command that I enclo&s;ed to you the note which your grateful di&s;po&s;ition &s;eems to lay too great a &s;tre&s;s upon. Both my uncle and my&s;elf were under the highe&s;t obligations to you, who hazarded your own life to prevent our &s;uffering a &s;light inconvenience. It is but ju&s;t that you &s;hould know this was the &s;en&s;e he had of your generous behaviour;. and the accident that befel you, in con&s;equence of it, being likely to pro|duce &s;ome inconveniences to you, who
<PB N="19" REF="18">
was far from home, and unattended&mdash; this was the cau&s;e of the liberty he took in offering you &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I am apprehen&s;ive, from the turn of your letter, that you will reject what you con&s;ider as an obligation, when you know it came from him. This is what I &s;incerely wi&s;h to prevent, for it will be a means of increa&s;ing and con|tinuing that ill-will which has unhap|pily taken place between your families. As in the circum&s;tances we both are, I can neither receive nor an&s;wer any more letters, without hazarding my uncle's di&s;plea&s;ure. I take this opportunity to a&s;&s;ure you that I am, with all the e&s;teem that is due to you, Sir,</P>

not be ea&s;y till I have your approbation, which is &s;o re&s;pected and revered by me, that I &s;hould prefer it to rea&s;on it&s;elf, if they were two things that could be &s;epa|rated, and one of them left to my choice. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX. MRS. NEVILLE, TO MISS HARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>I AM ju&s;t returned from Lord S.'s &s;eat, where I have &s;pent a week. It was a farewel vi&s;it; and, like all other farewel vi&s;its, was begun in plea&s;ure and ended in tears. The very day after my return, your Lady Jack&s;on called upon me, introducing her&s;elf with a letter from you. I could not open it with any propriety, as I heard from her that you were in health, &s;o I mi&s;&s;ed the advantage of knowing her character without the help of my own ob&s;erva|tions; but, to &s;ay the truth, there is no need of any great acutene&s;s to make one's &s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of the &s;ubject; for the fea|tures
<PB N="22" REF="21">
of her mind are as &s;trongly mark|ed as tho&s;e of her face; and, like a book printed in a large letter, the weake&s;t eyes may read her.</P>
<P>WITH a familiarity, which &s;he bor|rowed from the notion of her &s;uperior rank, &s;he invited her&s;elf to tea with me; and in le&s;s than half an hour profe&s;&s;ed, and claimed in return, an ardent and in|violable friend&s;hip. Having thus laid the foundations of an entire confidence, &s;he entertained me with the hi&s;tory of her life, in which, like all other roman|ces, love made the principal part&mdash;&s;he is a perfect homicide. There was no end to the murders of her eyes; then, for conjugal affection, none ever equalled her. Tho&s;e widows, who&s;e tears an|tiquity hath hallowed, were but the &s;hadows of her &s;ub&s;tantial grief. She left me at length, after a &s;trict embrace, to the plea&s;ure your letters always afford me.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">YOUR former large packet found me at Lord S.'s; it is full of adventure, my dear Maria. The unexpected meeting between your uncle and Mr. Harley has had con&s;equences that will certainly produce &s;ome intere&s;ting events. The merit of the young man, and the natural good di&s;po&s;ition of Sir John, prepare a &s;cene, in which you will perhaps have a part. How greatly am I obliged to you for giving me, in your charming journal, &s;o large a &s;hare of your conver&s;ation. The &s;cene will &s;oon change with me, and then my narratives may become in|tere&s;ting, for at pre&s;ent my days run on in one dull tenor, and afford nothing to engage your attention.</P>
<P>I HAVE another letter from you this moment&mdash;things have fallen out ju&s;t as I expected.&mdash;Mr. Harley is your conque&s;t. Well, there is nothing &s;ur|pri&s;ing in that, <HI>he has a heart, and you have conquering eyes.</HI> You compliment too highly when you lay &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s upon my advice and approbation.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">You have no need of any precepts, nor indeed of any in&s;truction; you cannot wander from the right if you go not a&s;tray from your own inclination, nor do ami&s;s, if you borrow not a frailty which is none of your own. Your letter &s;eems dictated by prudence it&s;elf. I wi&s;h, in|deed, there had been no concealment in the ca&s;e; but I &s;ee not how you could have &s;hewn Mr. Harley's letter to your uncle: there is one &s;evere expre&s;&s;ion in it, which would doubtle&s;s have given him great offence, and would, perhaps, have clouded for ever tho&s;e dawnings of good-will, which broke out, in &s;pite of him&s;elf, in con&s;equence of his engaging behaviour.</P>
<P>WE are to dine to-morrow on board the man of war which is to carry the colonel and his family, of which we are con&s;idered as a part, to New York. I know the mention of this circum&s;tance will rai&s;e &s;ome tumults in your brea&s;t; but you mu&s;t accu&s;tom your&s;elf, my
<PB N="25" REF="24">
dear Maria, to bear the&s;e preludes to our parting, that the parting it&s;elf may not fall &s;o heavy upon you.</P>
<P>MRS. Ben&s;on has &s;ettled all her affairs; and having no relations but &s;uch as are much richer than her&s;elf, &s;he has &s;unk part of her little fortune in an annuity for her life, and the remain|der &s;he has bequeathed to me. Her good &s;en&s;e and obliging manners en|dear her to every one that knows her. I am mo&s;t happy in this con&s;ideration, that having lo&s;t my mother, and upon the point of being &s;eparated from you, I have the comfort to enjoy &s;uch a com|panion&mdash;&s;uch a monitor and friend.</P>
<P>I AM to &s;pend this evening with Lady Jack&s;on, in con&s;equence of &s;o pre&s;&s;ing an invitation, that I know not how to refu&s;e. It &s;hall not be my fault if our intercour&s;e of vi&s;its do not end here. She would be my friend, that is, ac|cording to her notion of the thing&mdash;a
<PB N="26" REF="25">
companion in my amu&s;ements&mdash;one who returns my vi&s;its mo&s;t punctually, never fails to &s;end daily enquiries after my health if I am the lea&s;t indi&s;po&s;ed, and a mo&s;t &s;trict ob&s;erver of all the civil duties of life. But by a friend, I mean a witne&s;s of the con&s;cience, a phy&s;ician of &s;ecret griefs, a moderator in pro&s;pe|rity, and a guide in adver&s;ity. How little are &s;uch as the qualified to act that part? But you tell me &s;he &s;tyles her&s;elf an idolater of my character. A good opinion, it has been &s;aid, lays one under an obligation, let it come from whom it will; but it is only truly valuable when it proceeds from the wi&s;e, the candid, and the virtuous.</P>
<P>AT NIGHT.</P>
<P>I CANNOT clo&s;e my letter without giving you an account of a mo&s;t ex|travagantly kind propo&s;al Lady Jack&s;on made me.&mdash;I was obliged to &s;tay till the re&s;t of her company were gone, two
<PB N="27" REF="26">
of whom, &s;he &s;aid, were her intimate friends, married ladies, who&s;e hu&s;bands &s;he gave me to under&s;tand were, to her great grief, &s;o much in love with her, that &s;he lived in continual apprehen|&s;ion, left their unfortunate pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould be di&s;covered by their wives, who&s;e peace of mind &s;uch a di&s;covery would entirely de&s;troy.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;eemed impatient for my opi|nion and advice upon this her very hard ca&s;e, I told her gravely, that I had no advice to offer her but to keep the &s;ecret carefully her&s;elf, in order to pre|vent, as far as lay in her power, the bad con&s;equences &s;he apprehended. She then &s;uddenly changed the di&s;cour&s;e, loaded me with a thou&s;and profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, and called it a misfortune to have known me, &s;ince &s;he was to lo&s;e me &s;o &s;oon; execrated my hu&s;band's uncle for driving him, by his unju&s;t par&s;imony, to the nece&s;&s;ity of going abroad.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27">'BUT I have thought of a way,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>to prevent that nece&s;&s;ity, if you will do me the honour to accept my offer. I have &s;ome money unemploy|ed; I will lay it out in the purcha&s;e of a &s;mall e&s;tate in any county in Eng|land that will be mo&s;t agreeable to you. It &s;hall be yours for ever, if you will; yours at lea&s;t; as long as you may want it. Tell me you will accept my offer&mdash;tell me &s;o, and make me happy.</Q></P>
<P>MY fir&s;t emotions on this &s;peech were all gratitude and &s;urpri&s;e at the uncom|mon genero&s;ity it di&s;played: but her looks and manners bore &s;o little affinity with her words, that a moment after|wards I could &s;carce per&s;uade my&s;elf &s;he was in earne&s;t: for, while &s;he was pour|ing out the&s;e effu&s;ions of friend&s;hip and benevolence, &s;he had her eyes often turned towards the cla&s;s, with a compla|cency that &s;hewed how much her thoughts were taken up with the object it repre|&s;ented.
<PB N="29" REF="28">
And, in the mid&s;t of her earne&s;t entreaties that I would accept her offer, her hands were often employed in &s;etting the flounces of her petticoat, adju&s;ting her tucker, or pinning up a curl. The&s;e ob&s;ervations cooled the fir&s;t warmth of my gratitude: I expre&s;&s;ed my acknow|ledgments, however, for the genero&s;ity of her offer in civil terms, a&s;&s;uring her I &s;hould never forget it, but that I had &s;ome very powerful rea&s;ons for declining it. She would know my rea&s;ons.&mdash;I told her my hu&s;band was obliged in ho|nour to fulfil his engagements; and that, however painful it might be to me to leave my friends and my country, I hoped I &s;hould always be able to &s;a|crifice my inclination to his duty and reputation. That I had received from a dear and valuable friend, with whom I had been connected from my earlie&s;t youth, offers of the &s;ame generous na|ture with her's, and which, on the &s;ame account, I had been obliged to refu&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">SHE &s;eemed &s;atisfied with my excu&s;e; but lamented, in very pa&s;&s;ionate terms, her misfortune in being hopele&s;s to pre|vail upon me. We parted, with great cordiality on her &s;ide, and much civility on mine.</P>
<P>WHEN I related what had pa&s;&s;ed in this vi&s;it to my hu&s;band and Mrs. Ben|&s;on, they diverted them&s;elves extremely with my credulity, which they thought much greater than it was; for I did not endeavour to undeceive them, being really in &s;ome doubt whether I &s;hould wrong her by &s;u&s;pecting her &s;incerity.

<HEAD>LETTER XX MRS. NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>WELL, my dear friend, I have &s;ix weeks good yet. This news was like a reprieve to one under a pain|ful &s;entence, for I reckoned upon no more than a fortnight at farthe&s;t. May I not hope then to have one week of your dear &s;ociety granted by your uncle? Do, my Maria, make the reque&s;t now, while Sir John is with his friend; your ab&s;ence will be more ea&s;ily &s;upported by him. Tell him I entreat this favour, and I will number it among the many in&s;tances I have received of his good|ne&s;s, which will live in my memory for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31">NEVER having been on board a &s;hip in my life, you will ea&s;ily conceive, my dear Maria, how much I was affected with a &s;ight &s;o new and &s;trange as that of the&mdash;man of war, where I dined ye&s;terday, in company with Co|lonel Bellenden, his lady, and elde&s;t daughter. It was a beautiful, but to me terrific, object, when I con&s;idered, that in &s;uch a frail building I was to traver&s;e an immen&s;e ocean; every thing I &s;aw produced a&s;toni&s;hment, and ex|cited my curio&s;ity, &s;o that I a&s;ked a thou&s;and fooli&s;h que&s;tions, which were, however, an&s;wered with great civility by the gentlemen about us, by whom we were conducted round this little world, and &s;hewn every thing worthy our ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>THE commander is a young man, very genteel in his per&s;on and dre&s;s; his man|ners are polite, &s;oft, and in&s;inuating; but in my opinion he has too much of the courtier, and too little of the chief. He
<PB N="33" REF="32">
&s;uffered greatly in the compari&s;on with Colonel Bellenden, who in his per&s;on and manners unites dignity with &s;weet|ne&s;s, the martial air of a &s;oldier with the elegance of the gentleman, the noble frankne&s;s of his profe&s;&s;ion with the po|litene&s;s of a man of quality.</P>
<P>THE captain pre&s;ented his principal officers to Colonel Bellenden and the ladies. Mi&s;s Bellenden had rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with the effect of her charms; every eye was rivetted upon her; every tongue &s;eemed ready to pronounce her beautiful. I wi&s;h I could &s;ay &s;he receiv|ed this involuntary homage with greater propriety; &s;he even &s;eemed to claim more than was paid her; a con&s;cious &s;imper, an affected to&s;s of her head, a carele&s;s air, and a wandering eye, that &s;eemed &s;earching for new victims to gra|tify her pride of conque&s;t, proclaimed the temper of her mind.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">THE hand&s;ome, it has been &s;aid with great truth, can never be &s;een without re&s;pect, and their youth hath not more days than their beauty hath triumphs&mdash;they conquer as often as they appear; but the mi&s;chief of it is, that their tri|umphs are &s;hort, their youth is not la&s;t|ing, and the hand&s;ome at la&s;t grow ugly. Queens and prince&s;&s;es, &s;aid your Mr. Neville once in my hearing, grow old; and there is no ancient beauty but that of the &s;un and the &s;tars. What a pity it is then, that the generality of our &s;ex neglect to acquire, in youth, tho&s;e qualities which may pre&s;erve them from contempt when they are old, and &s;ecure e&s;teem when they can no longer excite admiration.</P>
<P>I SUSPECTED that my hu&s;band and Mrs. Ben&s;on, by their whi&s;pering and &s;ig|nificant &s;miles at each other whenever I mentioned Lady Jack&s;on, and her un|commonly generous offers, had &s;ome mi&s;chief in their heads; and to-day it
<PB N="35" REF="34">
came out. I had pa&s;&s;ed the whole morning in the city, making &s;ome pur|cha&s;es for our approaching voyage; during which Lady Jack&s;on paid me a vi&s;it. Mrs. Ben&s;on received her in my ab&s;ence, and li&s;tened for a whole hour to her extravagant profe&s;&s;ions of friend|&s;hip for me, and repinings at my cruel re&s;erve, which would not permit her to be of &s;ome u&s;e to me. Mrs. Ben&s;on ex|cu&s;ed me upon that delicacy which made per&s;ons born in affluence, and ac|cu&s;tomed to be&s;tow, not to receive fa|vours, &s;hy of laying them&s;elves under great and unreturnable obligations. This called forth an oftentatious di&s;play of the mo&s;t liberal &s;entiments from Lady Jack&s;on, delivered with an impetuo&s;ity of voice and action peculiar to her&s;elf. Again &s;he regretted her misfortune in not being permitted to &s;hew the ardour of her affection for me by &s;ome &s;ub&s;tan|tial proofs.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35">MRS. Ben&s;on &s;eemed moved with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of her friend&s;hip; and after a little pau&s;e &s;aid&mdash;<Q>It is a pity &s;uch ge|nerous warmth &s;hould fail of its pur|po&s;e; I have thought of a way by which you may gratify your earne&s;t de&s;ire of &s;erving Mrs. Neville, with|out wounding her delicacy.</Q></P>
<P>'PRAY name it,' &s;aid Lady Jack&s;on, with a look and accent in which much of her former fervour was abated.</P>
<P>'WHY, Madam,' &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, <Q>you mu&s;t certainly have heard of the fatal wreck of my friend's once &s;hin|ing fortunes; and that all tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, to which &s;he was born the heire&s;s, fell by her father's imprudence into the hands of his creditors. In a day or two &s;he is likely to &s;uffer a very &s;en&s;ible mortification by the &s;ale of a very fine collection of pictures, which her father, in a tour through Italy,
<PB N="37" REF="36">
purcha&s;ed at an immen&s;e expence. Some of the&s;e pictures were &s;o highly valued by her mother, who&s;e memory &s;he almo&s;t adores, that I am per&s;uaded you could not do her a more accept|able &s;ervice than to prevent them from going into other hands, by purcha&s;ing them for her. If you plea&s;e I will at|tend you to the auction-room, and point out to you tho&s;e particular pic|tures which &s;he &s;o ardently wi&s;hed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; &s;o that when the &s;ale takes place you may have them.</Q></P>
<P>'YOU are very obliging,' &s;aid Lady Jack&s;on, with a confu&s;ed accent, and a freezing look&mdash;<Q>I &s;hall not fail to give you notice when I am more at lei&s;ure than at pre&s;ent, being really very par|ticularly engaged.</Q> She then ro&s;e up, and took her leave, leaving kind com|pliments for me.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37">WHEN I came home, I found Mr. Ne|ville and Mrs. Ben&s;on enjoying their tri|umph over my credulity; and Mr. Ne|ville, after his u&s;ual manner, dictating to me upon the choice of my friends, and affirming, that he only was the pro|per judge of what per&s;ons I ought to ad|mit into my friend&s;hip and confidence. I pleaded hard for an exemption with regard to my female acquaintance; but he in&s;i&s;ted that we were no better judges of one another than we are of the men; and that a wife has nothing to do but to leave the choice to her hu&s;band's di&s;|cernment. You may be &s;ure I did not yield this point without a little conte&s;t; but in regard to Mr. Neville, I have often experienced the truth of that ob|&s;ervation, that with &s;ome per&s;ons it is not &s;afe to be rea&s;onable. Whenever it happens that my arguments pre&s;s home upon him, he has recour&s;e to an expedient that never fails to &s;ilence me, &mdash;he falls into a pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;I &s;ay not a

<HEAD>LETTER XXI. MISS HARLEY TO MRS. NEVILLE.</HEAD>
<P>YES, my dear Euphemia, our wi&s;hes are granted; I am permitted to &s;tay a week with you. My uncle did not wait to be reque&s;ted; he kindly propo&s;ed this little excur&s;ion to me as &s;oon as he knew that the time was fixed for your leaving England. Oh! that thought! but I will not di&s;tre&s;s you by my u&s;ele&s;s grief.</P>
<P>I HAVE had an interview with Mr. Harley. You are &s;urpri&s;ed;&mdash;you blame me, perhaps; but hear how it happened, and you will acquit me I hope, of imprudence, &s;ince it was really out of my power to prevent it.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="42">I HAD wandered into that de|lightful wood, where, &s;ince my abode at this &s;eat, I have pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many hours in &s;weet, yet painful recollection. I was employed in reading &s;ome of your let|ters, when the &s;ound of &s;teps at a di&s;|tance made me turn to &s;ee who was coming. Gue&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e when I &s;aw it was Mr. Harley. I &s;topped, uncertain what to do, or how to take this unex|pected intru&s;ion. He advanced with a &s;low and timid pace, his hat under his arm, his eyes ca&s;t on the ground, as if he was fearful to meet my quick-en|quiring glance. I remained immove|able; he approached me, bowing re|&s;pectfully.</P>
<P>'DO not be &s;urpri&s;ed, Mi&s;s Harley,' &s;aid he; <Q>wdo not be offended, that be|ing &s;oon to ab&s;ent my&s;elf from you, perhaps for ever, I have ventured to break in upon your &s;olitude; I could not depart without the &s;atisfaction of breathing at your feet tho&s;e vows my
<PB N="44" REF="43">
heart made the fir&s;t moment I beheld you.</Q> And he actually, my dear, threw him&s;elf at my feet with the air of an Orondates.</P>
<P>THE place, his po&s;ture, his language, had all &s;o romantic an air, that I could not help &s;miling as I de&s;ired him to ri&s;e. He did ri&s;e, but with a di&s;concerted look, while a deep blu&s;h over&s;pread his cheeks.</P>
<P>I PERCEIVED the fault I had been guilty of, and was angry with my&s;elf for having wounded a &s;en&s;ibility &s;o affect|ing. The alteration in my looks and manner relieved his confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>'MAY I hope,' &s;aid he, <Q>that you will pardon my pre&s;umption in coming to find you here?</Q></P>
<P>'THE pre&s;umption of this vi&s;it, Sir,' &s;aid I, <Q>may be ea&s;ily pardoned; but the imprudence of it, I am afraid, all
<PB N="45" REF="44">
things con&s;idered, cannot be ju&s;tified. Have you not called my uncle impla|cable? and indeed to you, perhaps, he appears &s;o.</Q></P>
<P>'And is he not &s;o, Madam,' replied he, <Q>to my family? I am &s;orry to ar|raign the conduct of a per&s;on who has had judgment enough to do ju&s;tice to your merit; but can his long conti|nued enmity to my father, the friend and companion of his youth, his neare&s;t kin&s;man, be excu&s;ed?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Not unle&s;s he had received &s;ome great injury,</Q> I replied.</P>
<P>'From my father, Madam,' inter|rupted he, <Q>impo&s;&s;ible! my father is not capable of injuring any one, much le&s;s his friend, his relation, and, as I have heard, his benefactor.</Q></P>
<P>I cast down my eyes, and was &s;ilent; the noble warmth, the filial tenderne&s;s,
<PB N="46" REF="45">
that appeared in his words, his accent, and his looks, affected me. I tried to di&s;&s;ipate a &s;tarting tear; it would not do, and I applied my handkerchief to my eyes&mdash;he looked eagerly at me&mdash;</P>
<P>'WHAT can this mean?' &s;aid he. <Q>You &s;eem greatly moved, Madam; do you know the cau&s;e of this long continued hatred on the part of Sir John? for as for my father, he appears to have no re&s;entment again&s;t him; he &s;peaks of him with re&s;pect, nay kindne&s;s. What can he have done to offend him &s;o highly?</Q></P>
<P>'Nothing,' replied I, <Q>unle&s;s you will allow it was an offence to &s;upplant him in his love for a mo&s;t amiable object.</Q></P>
<P>'Nothing!' exclaimed he eagerly, <Q>do you call that nothing which was to &s;tab him to the heart?&mdash;it was wor&s;e, &mdash;it was to make him live wretched.
<PB N="47" REF="46">
But was it his fault that he was the &s;ucce&s;sful lover? Yet that word <HI>&s;up|plant,</HI> implies &s;ome ba&s;ene&s;s in his conduct. Ba&s;ene&s;s! my father act ba&s;ely! that cannot be. I conjure you, Madam, &s;peak plainly. I perceive you are well acquainted with the par|ticulars of this affair&mdash;I wi&s;h to know them; what has e&s;caped you has given me great unea&s;ine&s;s: pray inform me further.</Q></P>
<P>'If what I have &s;aid,' replied I, <Q>has given you unea&s;ine&s;s, why &s;hould I increa&s;e it by complying with your re|que&s;t? I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed from &s;aying any more.</Q></P>
<P>'I see how it is,' &s;aid he; <Q>my fa|ther will &s;uffer by this explanation&mdash; I mu&s;t not expect it from your deli|cacy&mdash;every way I am unhappy.</Q>&mdash;He &s;ighed deeply, and was &s;ilent for a moment, &mdash;then added</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="47"><Q>Well, Madam, every thing concurs to &s;hew me the imprudence, the hope|le&s;&s;ne&s;s of that pa&s;&s;ion I have dared to entertain. &mdash; I came to take my leave; but do not imagine that I expect my cure from ab&s;ence&mdash;perhaps I do not wi&s;h it.</Q></P>
<P>'Pray no more of this,' &s;aid I con|fu&s;ed, as you may well imagine at this conver&s;ation&mdash; <Q>but tell me where you are going?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am going to &s;eek my fortune in the Indies,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>for I lie here a dead weight upon my father, who finds it difficult enough to bring up a large family of girls upon his &s;lender in|come.</Q></P>
<P>'To the Indies!' interrupted I; <Q>pray in what capacity? Are you to be dig|nified with a commi&s;&s;ion, and the title of captain or colonel in the Compa|ny's troops; or are you to be a trader
<PB N="49" REF="48">
your&s;elf?</Q>&mdash;<Q>I have no talents for ei|ther</Q>, &s;aid he &s;miling. &mdash;He was going on, when I heard my uncle's voice call|ing me at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>'I would not have you &s;een here,' &s;aid I, <Q>on any account; pray retire. If you are re&s;olved to go to the Indies, make Mr. Greville acquainted with your de&s;ign; he is your friend, and will be glad of an opportunity of &s;erv|ing you.</Q></P>
<P>I POINTED out to him the path he was to take, in order to avoid meeting my uncle; and curt&s;eying low, turned from him. He followed me two or three &s;teps, and taking my hand re&s;pect|fully, rai&s;ed it to his lips; I felt it wet with a falling tear. He darted like lightning from me, and in an in&s;tant was out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>I met my uncle a moment after|wards; he &s;aid he had been looking for
<PB N="50" REF="49">
me; and pointing to Mr. Greville, who was following him&mdash;'Our ho&s;t,' &s;aid he, <Q>is come to take leave of you; he has received news which obliges him to &s;et out for the North immediately.</Q> Mr. Greville accordingly joined us, and we walked with him to the gate, where his po&s;t-chai&s;e waited.</P>
<P>I WAS very much concerned at his departure, on Mr. Harley's account, to whom I know he wi&s;hes well. I was not without a hope that his repre&s;enta|tions of the young gentleman's ca&s;e might have made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion upon my uncle, and induced him to prevent the heir of his title and fortune from &s;eeking a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in &s;o di&s;tant a part of the globe, for my uncle is naturally good; but the be&s;t virtues have need of &s;ome &s;tandard to guide them.</P>
<P>We are to return to the Hall to-mor|row, and the next day I am to &s;et out for London. Oh! this meeting, what
<PB N="51" REF="50">
joy would it afford me, were it not &s;o &s;oon to be followed by a long, long ab&s;ence! How can I &s;upport the thought? There is no friend&s;hip in the world of &s;o much u&s;e to me as yours: it is my defence in all my conte&s;ts&mdash;it is my con&s;olation in all my di&s;tre&s;&s;es: but what is &s;till more, it is my oracle in all my doubts. That which, before I have your advice, I propo&s;e to my|&s;elf with diffidence, when once I have your approbation I make it a maxim. Adieu! my deare&s;t friend.

Why did I not make him acquainted with all that has pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Harley and me? I know you di&s;approve my conduct upon this occa&s;ion; but I had not you to ad|vi&s;e with at the time. I remember, in &s;peaking of this affair, you told me that concealment always implies &s;ome|thing wrong: it is true, and apppear|ances are again&s;t me; to be thought ungrateful, capable of taking advantage of that independence which his good|ne&s;s
<PB N="55" REF="54">
be&s;towed on me, and contrary to his will&mdash;I cannot bear it; I will be ju&s;tified in his opinion, and become once more dependant on his bounty.</P>
<P>BUT this dear, this affectionate, this more than father, &s;huns me; and hav|ing already condemned me in his thoughts, is unwilling to hear my de|fence; before the &s;ervants, and in com|pany, his behaviour, though le&s;s tender, is &s;till polite; but when we are left alone, he is &s;ilent, re&s;erved, and even &s;tern: and either retires to his own apartment, or orders the carriage to take an airing, without a&s;king me to ac|company him.</P>
<P>He is this moment returned from one of the&s;e little excur&s;ions; I will go to him; he is alone in his library; either he mu&s;t acquit me of any de&s;ign to of|fend him, which Heaven knows is the truth, or take back tho&s;e gifts which, by making me independent of him, have
<PB N="56" REF="55">
expo&s;ed me to his &s;u&s;picions. Oh! that you were here to advi&s;e, to direct me! I think I know how you would act on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; I will endeavour to imitate you; you are all openne&s;s, can|dour, and &s;incerity&mdash;&s;o innocence &s;hould be; and I am &s;ure I have no wilful offence, with regard to my uncle, to charge my&s;elf with. Well, I will go, I will &s;peak to him; I will act this hu|miliating part; for &s;urely nothing can, be more &s;o than, con&s;cious of innocence, to have a character to defend&mdash;but I will delay no longer&mdash;I go.</P>
<P>This dreaded interview is over. I found my uncle in his library; he was reading; he looked up on my entrance. I a&s;ked if he was bu&s;y; my countenance, and the tone of my voice, which par|took, I &s;uppo&s;e, of the perturbation of my heart, affected him I believe, for he an&s;wered with his u&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s; 'not if you have any thing to &s;ay to me;' and
<PB N="57" REF="56">
ri&s;ing, drew a chair for me oppo&s;ite to his.</P>
<P><Q>TILL I can remove the prejudices you have entertained again&s;t me, I am,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>unworthy to &s;it in your pre&s;ence, and far, far unworthy of that affluence your lavi&s;h gifts have rai&s;ed me to; re&s;ume tho&s;e gifts, I be&s;eech you, Sir; &s;uffer me to return to my former dependance on your bounty, and let my behaviour be the mea&s;ure of your future genero&s;ity to me.</Q></P>
<P>'YOU are &s;trangely moved,' &s;aid my uncle, looking earne&s;tly on me; 'What do you complain of, Maria?' 'I do not pre&s;ume to complain, Sir,' replied I, <Q>but I lament the lo&s;s of your favour, which is but too appa|rent from your altered behaviour to me.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="57">'ARE you con&s;cious,' &s;aid he, <Q>of having done any thing to give me cau&s;e of complaint again&s;t you?</Q></P>
<P>'I AM, Sir,' an&s;wered I!</P>
<P>'THAT is hone&s;t,' &s;aid he, <Q>well, &s;ince you have got &s;o far in your con|fe&s;&s;ion, pray go on, and let me have the whole.</Q></P>
<P>He &s;poke this with a half &s;mile, which gave me courage to proceed.</P>
<P>'THE fault I have to confe&s;s, Sir,' &s;aid I, <Q>is my having received a letter from Mr. Harley, and an&s;wering it, without communicating either his let|ter, or my an&s;wer to you. I have al&s;o &s;een him; and this circum&s;tance, like|wi&s;e, I have concealed from you.</Q></P>
<P>'AND was this right?' &s;aid my uncle, a little &s;ternly.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="58">'MY intention was not wrong, Sir,' replied I. <Q>The principles of good actions,</Q> interrupted my uncle, <Q>are good inclinations; if you meant well, how did it happen that you have acted ill?</Q></P>
<P>'YOU will be a judge, Sir,' &s;aid I, <Q>how far I have acted ill on this occa|&s;ion, if you will conde&s;cend to read the papers I have in my hands; here is Mr. Harley's letter to me, and a copy of my an&s;wer to it.</Q></P>
<P>'GIVE them to me,' &s;aid my uncle, with &s;ome precipitation.</P>
<P>I DID &s;o; he walked to the window, and I could perceive that he read both the letters twice over with great atten|tion. He did not return them to me, but threw them both upon the table, and re&s;uming his &s;eat&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="59">'SO the &s;on of my greate&s;t enemy,' &s;aid he peevi&s;hly, <Q>has made you a declaration of love? You whom I have con&s;idered as my daughter, and for whom I have the affection of a father.</Q></P>
<P>MY dear uncle,' &s;aid I, <Q>my more than father, Heaven is my witne&s;s I would rather die than offend you!</Q> I could not utter the&s;e words without tears. He looked at me, I thought, kindly. <Q>You have read my an&s;wer to Mr. Har|ley's letter, Sir?</Q> pur&s;ued I; <Q>is there any thing in it which offends you?</Q></P>
<P>'WHY, I cannot &s;ay,' &s;aid he, <Q>that your letter is much ami&s;s, con&s;idering that you certainly were not di&s;plea&s;ed with his declaration.</Q></P>
<P>'DOES that appear, Sir?' &s;aid I. <Q>I think it does</Q>, replied he.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="60">NOw, my dear Euphemia, this &s;ur|pri&s;ed me: you have read this letter, do you think it will bear that infe|rence? I am &s;ure I did not intend it &s;hould; I was vexed, &mdash;I was confu&s;ed; I could not bear my uncle's looks, which were fixed upon me. I ca&s;t down my eyes, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>HE &s;eemed to wait for &s;ome reply; but finding I &s;aid nothing&mdash;</P>
<P>'TAKING it for granted,' &s;aid he, <Q>what you have as good as confe&s;&s;ed, that the addre&s;&s;es of my enemy's &s;on are far from being unwelcome to you, and that your heart is very, very fa|vourably di&s;po&s;ed towards him&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>I ROSE up precipitately.</P>
<P>'OH! Sir,' &s;aid I, <Q>I have not de|&s;erved this:</Q> my tears flowed fa&s;t, I covered my face with my handkerchief,
<PB N="62" REF="61">
and curt&s;eying without looking at him, I was ha&s;tening out of the room.</P>
<P>MY uncle ro&s;e up al&s;o, and getting between me and the door, took my hand, and led me back to my chair; he removed my handkerchief from my eyes; and &s;till holding my hand&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>NAY, you mu&s;t hear what I have more to &s;ay,</Q> &s;aid he, and &s;miling, re|peated, <Q>taking it for granted that your heart is very favourably di&s;po&s;ed towards this young man, who is the &s;on of my mortal enemy, and who has him&s;elf offended me, by pre&s;uming to declare a pa&s;&s;ion for you, and endea|vouring to engage you in a clande&s;tine corre&s;pondence with him: you whom I love, whom I have con&s;idered as my daughter, and from whom I might expect &s;ome returns of affection, and even duty: have I not rea&s;on to com|plain of you, Maria, for encouraging
<PB N="63" REF="62">
preten&s;ions which you knew I could never approve?</Q></P>
<P>I VENTURED to interrupt him here.</P>
<P><Q>DOES it appear, Sir, by my an&s;wer to his letter, that I have encouraged his preten&s;ions?</Q> &s;aid I.</P>
<P><Q>IT does not appear by your letter,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>that you have di&s;couraged them.</Q>
<Q><L>He comes too near who comes to be de|nied,</L></Q>
&s;aid a poet very &s;kilful in the&s;e matters; <Q>and one denial, it &s;eems, will not &s;erve his turn, el&s;e why is he continually hovering about my hou&s;e, in hopes of &s;ome opportunity of &s;peaking to you?</Q></P>
<P>NOW this circum&s;tance, my dear Euphemia, I was till then quite igno|rant of&mdash;I blu&s;hed&mdash;my uncle ob&s;erved
<PB N="64" REF="63">
it. <Q>I do not wi&s;h to di&s;tre&s;s you, Ma|ria,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I pretend not to con|trol your inclinations&mdash;you are your own mi&s;tre&s;s; I &s;u&s;pected that you had acted di&s;ingenuou&s;ly with me; and it was this notion which produced the coldne&s;s you complain of. I have been too ha&s;ty in my conclu&s;ions, I believe; I do not perceive that you are much to blame in this bu&s;ine&s;s; but I &s;hall always think it a misfortune, that the per&s;on neare&s;t and deare&s;t to me in the world, &s;hould form connections with tho&s;e I have mo&s;t rea&s;on to hate.</Q></P>
<P>AT that moment Mr. Greville was announced&mdash;I ro&s;e up, and being un|willing to be &s;een in the di&s;order I then was, I hurried out of the room, &s;aying only the&s;e few words to him&mdash;</P>
<Q>DEPEND upon it, Sir, you &s;hall be &s;atisfied with me; I would not di&s;|plea&s;e you for the world.</Q>
<P><PB N="65" REF="64">I HAVE often ob&s;erved, my dear Eu|phemia, that mo&s;t per&s;ons con&s;ider le&s;s the rea&s;ons of what is propo&s;ed to them contrary to their inclinations, than the motives which may have obliged the per&s;on who propo&s;es them to make u&s;e of tho&s;e rea&s;ons; had I attended only to my uncle's motives for the di&s;appro|bation he expre&s;&s;ed of Mr. Harley's addre&s;&s;es to me, I might have thought them rather unju&s;tifiable; but the rea|&s;ons he brought to influence my con|duct were unan&s;werable. As my parent, my friend, my benefactor, he had a right to my obedience; which, by having &s;o nobly made me independent of his control, is an effect of my will, not of con&s;traint: and I could not di&s;oblige him, without being guilty of the high|e&s;t ingratitude.</P>
<P>I HESITATED not a moment in re&s;olv|ing to put an end to Mr. Harley's hopes, if he entertained any; and to forbid him ab&s;olutely from &s;eeking op|portunities
<PB N="66" REF="65">
to write or &s;peak to me any more. My fir&s;t intention was to write to him; but I found I could not plea&s;e my&s;elf in the terms I was to u&s;e: the&s;e appeared too har&s;h, tho&s;e not deci&s;ive enough. I tore my letter, and conclud|ed that my be&s;t way was to engage Mr. Greville to acquaint him with my in|tentions, and to prevail upon him to de&s;i&s;t from his pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>THIS &s;eemed &s;o happy a thought, that I became compo&s;ed enough to take my place at table, without &s;hewing, in my countenance and behaviour, any traces of the di&s;order I had been in &s;o lately.</P>
<P>I PERCEIVED that my uncle ob&s;erved me heedfully, and &s;eemed plea&s;ed. I found an opportunity to have a quarter of an hour's private conver&s;ation with Mr. Greville, to whom I related, not without &s;ome confu&s;ion, all that had pa&s;&s;ed in regard to Mr. Harley; and as
<PB N="67" REF="66">
I knew he often &s;aw him, begged he would prevent my having any further di&s;quiet upon his account.</P>
<P>MR. Greville promi&s;ed to execute my commi&s;&s;ion, for he acknowledged that I had no other part to act. The next news I &s;hall hear perhaps is, that the poor youth is gone to the Indies. Well, what of that? You are going to America; can I think of that dreadful circum&s;tance, and &s;uffer any meaner regrets to mix with &s;o ju&s;t, &s;o poignant an affliction? Adieu!</P>

<P>MR Greville, it &s;eems, &s;oon met with an opportunity of delivering my me&s;&s;age, which he charged him&s;elf with two days ago, and is this morning re|turned to give me an account of his commi&s;&s;ion; he appeared affected with the gentle &s;orrow, for &s;o he phra&s;ed it, with which Mr. Harley received my ab&s;olute rejection of him; it never ro&s;e to complaint, &s;aid he, much le&s;s to murmurings again&s;t your commands; &s;ilent dejection, and &s;ome half-&s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;ighs, and a promi&s;e faintly pro|nounced&mdash;that he would obey you, were all his an&s;wer.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>MISS HARLEY TO MRS. NEVILLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR EUPHEMIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have a right to all occa&s;ions of doing good; I think it therefore in|cumbent upon me to offer you one. There is a young woman in my neigh|bourhood, for whom I have a great e&s;teem, on account of her good &s;en&s;e and amiable qualities. Some di&s;appoint|ments &s;he has lately met with, makes her very de&s;irous to go abroad. She will think her&s;elf happy to be about your per&s;on, for &s;he knows enough of your character to love and revere you with a kind of enthu&s;ia&s;m: her hi&s;tory is briefly this:</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="74">HER parents, who were per&s;ons of genteel birth and education, dying when &s;he was very young, left her wholly unprovided for, to the charita|ble cares of an aunt, who was a widow, without children, and in tolerable cir|cum&s;tances. She bred up the little girl as her own, gave her a good edu|cation, and declared &s;he would leave her all &s;he was worth. The merit of the girl, and the dutiful and affection|ate returns &s;he made to her kindne&s;s, made this di&s;po&s;ing of her property &s;eem not more an act of affection than ju&s;tice. The old gentlewoman being &s;eized with a dangerous fit of &s;ickne&s;s, &s;ent for an attorney, in great practice here, to make her will: a man remark|able for his &s;ucce&s;s in his profe&s;&s;ion, by which, being likewi&s;e very fortunate in the numerous legacies that have been bequeathed him, he has made a very con&s;iderable fortune in a few years.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="75">THE old lady died; and when the will was opened, Mr. D. the attorney, was, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of every one, appointed her executor, and &s;ole heir to her fortune, which was about two thou&s;and pounds&mdash;her once-loved neice being cut off with a &s;hilling!&mdash;This &s;trange and unexpected rever&s;e of for|tune drew on a &s;till more poignant af|fliction: A young man, who had courted her with the con&s;ent of his parents, and to whom &s;he was &s;oon to have been married, was ordered by them to &s;ee her no more. He loved her, and per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution to marry her, though at the hazard of lo&s;ing the greate&s;t part of his fortune by di&s;obliging his father. &mdash; Poor Fanny! though &s;he loves him tenderly, has had the genero&s;ity to give him a po&s;itive denial, and to avoid his im|portunities; and doubtful, perhaps, of her own re&s;olution, is anxiou&s;ly de&s;ir|ous of leaving England. When I mentioned recommending her to you,
<PB N="77" REF="76">
&s;he was in tran&s;ports. If you approve of my propo&s;al, I will &s;end her to Lon|don in the &s;tage-coach, under the care of our hou&s;ekeeper, a good matronly woman, who has a great kindne&s;s for her, with who&s;e ab&s;ence I mu&s;t di&s;pen&s;e for a few days, that I may have the &s;atisfaction of delivering her &s;afe to your protection.</P>
<P>I AM very unea&s;y about my uncle; I am afraid he is going to have a &s;evere attack of his old di&s;temper, the gout; at pre&s;ent it is but &s;light, yet he is more re&s;tle&s;s and impatient than u&s;ual. I read to him continually; but he does not &s;eem to give much attention, and often interrupts me to tell me, that my voice is low and faint, and that my &s;pirits &s;eem greatly depre&s;&s;ed. It may be &s;o; and &s;ure I have cau&s;e, &s;o &s;oon to be &s;e|parated from the friend of my heart, the companion of my youth, my com|fort in adver&s;ity, and my example for virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="77">MR. Greville will have it that my uncle is not quite &s;atisfied with his con|duct towards young Mr. Harley, which, doubtle&s;s, &s;aid he, was har&s;h, if not un|ju&s;t; and yet, if he was here (&s;o he is gone you &s;ee, my Euphemia), it is probable he would not alter it. Now I cannot be of this opinion. I am &s;ure, if my un|cle thought he was wrong in this ca&s;e, he would make ha&s;te to be right: bad men ju&s;tify their faults, the good amend them.</P>
<P>I WAS obliged to lay down my pen, being &s;ummoned to Sir John, who was taken extremely ill. The phy&s;icians were afraid the gout was getting into his &s;tomach. I have not been in bed the&s;e two nights: my dear, &s;uffering uncle, &s;eeing me continually by his bed|&s;ide, expre&s;&s;ed great unea&s;ine&s;s, le&s;t my health might &s;uffer by &s;o con&s;tant an attendance upon him, and in&s;i&s;ted upon my retiring to re&s;t. It was not po&s;&s;ible for me to obey him; &s;o I kept out of
<PB N="79" REF="78">
his &s;ight, yet without quitting his apart|ment.</P>
<P>THIS morning, when I approached his bed, as if ju&s;t come down from my own chamber, he took notice that I looked very pale, and &s;aid, <Q>He was afraid I had not &s;lept well.</Q> He com|forted me with an a&s;&s;urance that he was better; and pre&s;&s;ing my hand affection|ately, 'You are a good girl,' &s;aid he, <Q>your whole conduct is of a piece. I never will forget the generous &s;acrifice you have made me on a late oc|ca&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>I FELT my face all in a glow; I was not able to make him any an&s;wer. The phy&s;icians coming in relieved my con|fu&s;ion; they pronounced him better: and now being in &s;ome mea&s;ure free from my racking apprehen&s;ions, I really retired to my chamber, and threw my|&s;elf upon my bed. Two hours &s;leep re|fre&s;hed me &s;o much, that when I entered
<PB N="80" REF="79">
my uncle's apartment again, he per|ceived the alteration in my looks.</P>
<P>I FOUND the &s;ervants had informed him that I had not been in bed for three nights; he tenderly reproached me with the deceit I had practi&s;ed upon him; but added, <Q>that as he hoped for &s;ome re&s;t him&s;elf to-night, the phy&s;icians having ordered &s;omething to compo&s;e him, he would never pardon me if I did not go to bed.</Q></P>
<P>MR. Greville is come to pa&s;s a day or two here. I left the two friends to|gether, and retired to my own apart|ment, to have the plea&s;ure of conver&s;ing with you, my dear friend; for when I am writing to you, and relating all the little occurrences that help to vary the dull &s;cene of my life, I fancy you are pre&s;ent, and I am talking to you. Adieu! however, for a little time.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="80">I HAVE a &s;trange and terrible circum|&s;tance to tell you, my Euphemia, which I &s;hall never wholly lo&s;e the remem|brance of, and which, as often as it is recollected, will probably occa&s;ion the &s;ame horrors that I feel now.</P>
<P>THIS evening, when I went into my uncle's chamber to take leave of him for the night, he told me he would take the draught that was ordered for him then, that he might have the plea&s;ure of taking it from my hands. Accordingly, after having read the label, I poured the medicine into a cup, and gave it into his hand: in the very moment that he was rai&s;ing it to his lips Martin came into the room, and perceiving what my uncle was doing, cried out, with eyes all wild and &s;taring, and in a voice &s;carce articulate, from the violence of his agitation&mdash;<Q>Hold, Sir! for Heaven's &s;ake do not drink!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="81">'WHAT is the matter with the man,' &s;aid my uncle; 'are you mad?'</P>
<P><Q>YOU have not drank any of it, have you, Sir,</Q> &s;aid he, eagerly taking the cup out of his ma&s;ter's hand, <Q>are you &s;ure you have not?</Q></P>
<P>'WELL,' replied my uncle, <Q>I have not, and what then?</Q></P>
<P>'Heaven be prai&s;ed!' &s;aid the good old man. <Q>Why, Sir, if you had drank it, you would have been dead by this time; it is poi&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>'How! poi&s;on!' &s;aid my uncle a&s;to|ni&s;hed. As for me, I was near fainting, and &s;hould have fallen to the ground, if my dear uncle, weak as he was, had not rai&s;ed him&s;elf up in his bed to &s;upport me: in the mean time Mr. Greville was examining the medicine.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="82">'I BELIEVE it is laudanum,' &s;aid he; <Q>and &s;ure enough you would, as Mar|tin &s;ays, have been a dead man if you had taken this do&s;e. But pray, my good friend,</Q> &s;aid he to Martin, <Q>how did it happen that you knew this?</Q></P>
<P>'SIR,' &s;aid Martin, <Q>two moments &s;ince a man and hor&s;e came to the gate; he mu&s;t have rode hard indeed, for the hor&s;e was all over in a foam. <Q>If your ma&s;ter has not yet drank the potion that was &s;ent him by Mr. Allen, the apothecary, this evening,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>ha&s;te &mdash; prevent him &mdash; it is poi&s;on. Allen will be here &s;oon after me and explain,</Q>&mdash;and he rode away in&s;tantly.</Q></P>
<P>MR. Greville now congratulated my uncle on his e&s;cape, who &s;eemed touched with the &s;incer&s;t gratitude to Heaven for his pre&s;ervation, and &s;aid &s;ome very kind things to Martin, who had been, under Providence, the happy in&s;trument of it.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="83">IT WAS &s;ome time before I could re|cover any degree of compo&s;ure, &s;o greatly had I been affected by my uncle's danger. He pre&s;&s;ed me earne&s;tly to go to bed; but all inclination to &s;leep was vani&s;hed, and I was re&s;olved to &s;it up, and hear what the apothecary had to &s;ay.</P>
<P>I RETIRED, however, for a few mo|ments, to write you an account of this &s;trange accident, which was likely to have been &s;o fatal a one, both to him and me; for I think I never &s;hould have forgiven my&s;elf for having, though in|nocently, admini&s;tered the deadly draught to him.</P>
<P>THESE ill-&s;haped letters and crooked lines are an effect of that agitation un|der which I &s;till labour.</P>
<P>SURE the apothecary mu&s;t be come by this time.&mdash;I am impatient to hear how this dreadful mi&s;take happened. For
<PB N="85" REF="84">
the future I &s;hall tremble to take their medicines; for how can one be &s;ure of their exactne&s;s? Jenny tells me Mr. Allen is this moment arrived.</P>
<P>ONE IN THE MORNING.</P>
<P>WELL, my dear friend, here I am, in my own chamber, without the lea&s;t de&s;ire of going to bed to night. Joy is as great an enemy to &s;leep as grief; and I am overjoyed, I own it. You are &s;urpri&s;ed&mdash;you are impatient to know what has happened to produce a &s;en&s;a|tion I am &s;o little acquainted with&mdash;&s;o long unfelt, and almo&s;t de&s;paired of. Take then things in order, and &s;hare, largely &s;hare in the &s;atisfaction of your friend.</P>
<P>MR. Allen entered my uncle's apart|ment a moment after me; his counte|nance retained the traces of the great perturbation he had been in.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="85">'HEAVEN be prai&s;ed! Sir,' &s;aid he to his patient, <Q>that this mi&s;take has had no other con&s;equences than to make me, for &s;ome hours, the mo&s;t wretched man in the world.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I can ea&s;ily con|ceive the fright you have been in,</Q> &s;aid Sir John; <Q>but prithee, Allen, how did it happen that you &s;ent me this fatal do&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>'SIR,' replied the apothecary, <Q>a patient of mine, a gentlewoman in years, is accu&s;tomed to take &s;mall do&s;es of laudanum every night: &s;he is mi&s;e|rable if it is not always at hand; &s;o I generally &s;end her two ounces at a time. I had prepared your draught, and wrote the labels for both the phials, when a &s;ervant of a dear friend of mine, who lived about a quarter of a mile di&s;tant, came to tell me that I mu&s;t go in&s;tantly and bleed his ma&s;ter, who was in an apoplectic fit.</Q></P>
<Q><PB N="87" REF="86"><P>MY journeyman, who had always been remarkably diligent and careful in his bu&s;ine&s;s, was ju&s;t ready to mount on hor&s;eback to take your medicine to the Hall. I gave him the label; and &s;hewing him the phial, bid him tie it on, and &s;et out with it immedi|ately; and I ha&s;tened to relieve my friend. My man, who, during the five years that he has lived with me, never made any mi&s;take of this kind before, took the phial which contained the laudanum, put the label on it de|&s;igned for your draught, and rode away.</P>
<P>WHEN I came home, about an hour afterwards, I di&s;covered the dreadful mi&s;take; the draught de&s;igned for you being &s;till on the counter. I con|cluded that the other was by this time delivered, and probably taken. I was almo&s;t di&s;tracted, having no hor&s;e but that my journeyman rode on, I deter|mined to &s;et out on foot for the Hall;
<PB N="88" REF="87">
but, however anxiety and terror might have quickened my pace, I mu&s;t have come too late, when a gentleman alight|ing at my door, de&s;ired me to dre&s;s his hand, which by &s;ome accident he had cut dreadfully. I an&s;wered, that it was impo&s;&s;ible; that Sir John Har|ley was in danger of being poi&s;oned by a mi&s;take of my man, who had carried him a large do&s;e of laudanum in&s;tead of the pre&s;cription I had pre|pared for him. Saying this, I ru&s;hed by him, &s;carce knowing what I did.</P></Q>
<P><Q>THE gentleman in&s;tantly re-mounted his hor&s;e, and putting him in full gal|lop, cried out to me as he pa&s;&s;ed by me, that he would be at the Hall in le&s;s than ten minutes, and hoped to pre|vent the mi&s;chief. Then, and not be|fore, I recollected who he was.</Q>&mdash;<Q>And who is he?</Q> &s;aid my uncle eagerly; <Q>The reverend Dr. Harley's &s;on,</Q> re|plied Mr. Allen, <Q>I know him very well.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="88">My uncle hearing this name, cla&s;ped his hands together with great emotion, and ca&s;ting his eyes fir&s;t upon Mr. Gre|ville, then on me, with a look big with meaning, he turned him&s;elf about in his bed, and continued &s;ilent. His piercing glance at me filled me, I know not how, with confu&s;ion. I felt my face covered with blu&s;hes. I could not look at Mr. Greville, who exclaimed two or three times, in a tran&s;ported ac|cent&mdash;'Generous, noble fellow! What think you of this, my friend, &s;aid he to Sir John, approaching his bed. My uncle made him no an&s;wer; but I thought I heard him &s;igh deeply.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville then ob&s;erving that Mr. Allen mu&s;t be greatly fatigued with &s;o long a walk in &s;uch agitation of mind (and indeed the poor man looked like a gho&s;t), de&s;ired him to walk into the next room, where he would find &s;omething to refre&s;h him, and in the mean time he
<PB N="90" REF="89">
would give directions for a hor&s;e to be &s;addled, to carry him home.</P>
<P>Mr. Allen withdrew; and Martin appearing upon Mr. Greville's ringing the bell, my uncle interrupted the or|ders he was giving, to a&s;k him eagerly if he knew the per&s;on who brought the me&s;&s;age from the apothecary.</P>
<P>'YES, Sir,' &s;aid Martin, <Q>it was Mr. Harley.</Q> <Q>And why did you not tell us this circum&s;tance?</Q> &s;aid my uncle. Martin ca&s;t down his eyes.</P>
<P><Q>How did he look, &mdash;what did he &s;ay to you?</Q> a&s;ked my uncle.</P>
<P><Q>HE &s;eemed to be in great agitation: Sir,</Q> replied Martin, <Q>his hor&s;e was all in a foam, and him&s;elf &s;eemed al|mo&s;t breathle&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="90"><Q>"Has your ma&s;ter,' &s;aid he, <Q>taken the medicine that Mr. Allen &s;ent here this morning?</Q> I replied, No. <Q>Fly, prevent him, it is poi&s;on,</Q> &s;aid he; <Q>the apothecary is following me, he will explain the mi&s;take.</Q> The porter has &s;ince told me, that he rode away in|&s;tantly, and that he thought he was wounded, for his handkerchief was bound round his left hand, and &s;eemed covered with blood.</Q></P>
<P>My uncle then bid Martin go and attend Mr. Allen; when Mr. Greville repeating,</P>
<Q>WHAT think you of all this, my friend?</Q>
<P>'I THINK,' replied Sir John, <Q>that this young man is the noble&s;t of all human beings. My life &s;tood be|tween him and an ample fortune; and, what is more, between him and a ble&s;|&s;ing which he &s;ets perhaps a much
<PB N="92" REF="91">
higher value upon. Yet has he &s;aved that life with the hazard of his own, and done as much for his enemy as he would have done for his father.</Q>&mdash;Then pau&s;ing a little&mdash;<Q>And a father I will be to him now,</Q> added he; <Q>from this moment I will con&s;ider him as my &s;on. Why is he not here, that I may embrace and call him &s;o?</Q> My uncle &s;poke this in &s;o affectionate a manner, as moved even the lively Mr. Greville.</P>
<P>'WHERE &s;hall I find, him,' pur&s;ued he&mdash;<Q>who will bring him to me? that wound in his hand alarms me. I feel already the anxiety of a father for him.</Q> Then looking at me with a ten|der &s;mile,</P>
<P>'MARIA,' &s;aid he, <Q>will not, I hope, be jealous of this new-&s;prung affec|tion for a per&s;on &s;o worthy.</Q> I was &s;ilent; for what indeed could I &s;ay? Mr. Harley's merits are too great for
<PB N="93" REF="92">
prai&s;e&mdash;for my poor prai&s;e. My uncle &s;eemed to have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of them; and for this I could not but rejoice.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville, who &s;at mu&s;ing for &s;ome time, at la&s;t &s;aid, <Q>The appear|ance of young Harley in the&s;e parts &s;urpri&s;es me. I know he took leave of his family a week ago, in order to go on board the&mdash;Indiaman, which I thought had failed by this time. Perhaps I may get &s;ome in|telligence from Allen; I'll go to him.</Q> He did &s;o, and returned again in a quarter of an hour; during which time my uncle and I had not &s;poke a word to each other.</P>
<P>'ALLEN tells me,' &s;aid Mr. Greville, <Q>that he met Mr. Harley when he had got about half way to the Hall. He called out to him in a joyful tone, and told him all was &s;afe. He com|plained of the hurt in his hand, and &s;aid, he would &s;top at his hou&s;e, and
<PB N="94" REF="93">
get his journeyman, if he was come home, to put &s;ome dre&s;&s;ings upon it.</Q> Mr. Allen begged he would &s;tay till he came back if he did not find his man at home. Mr. Harley replied, <Q>that he had not a moment to &s;pare; that he was going to hire a po&s;t-chai&s;e at the Ro&s;e-Inn, and intended to travel all night, being apprehen&s;ive that the &s;hip would fail without him;his fa|ther's &s;udden illne&s;s having detained him longer than he expected.</Q></P>
<P>'So, then,' interrupted my uncle, in a tone of deep di&s;tre&s;s, 'he is gone!'</P>
<P>'No, no, I hope not,' replied Mr. Greville; <Q>I have di&s;patched Allen on hor&s;eback, with directions, if he finds the youth at his hou&s;e, as I doubt not but he will, to tell him that he mu&s;t not &s;tir from thence till I have &s;een him, which &s;hall be early in the morn|ing. Allen can accommodate him with a bed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="94">'THIS will not do,' cried my uncle vehemently, <Q>this voyage mu&s;t be pre|vented, or I &s;hall never enjoy a quiet moment. Bid Martin get on hor&s;e|back in&s;tantly; and if he does not find Harley at Allen's, let him go on with all &s;peed to the Ro&s;e-Inn. Dear Greville ha&s;ten him; mean time I will write a line my&s;elf to Harley. Maria, give me pen, ink and paper.</Q></P>
<P>MY uncle's impetuo&s;ity put us all in motion. Mr. Greville ha&s;tened to give Martin his orders; I brought my uncle what he de&s;ired; he &s;at up in his bed, and made &s;hift to &s;crawl a few lines. Here is is a copy of them:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MR. HARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>WORTHY young man! you have &s;aved my life; but if you would not embitter the remainder of it, think no more of your voyage to India; return
<PB N="96" REF="95">
with my me&s;&s;enger, and expect for the future to find a father, an affectionate father, in</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>JOHN HARLEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Greville inclo&s;ed this note in one from him&s;elf; and Martin, who &s;eemed exce&s;&s;ively plea&s;ed with his com|mi&s;&s;ion, a&s;&s;ured us he would not return without the ble&s;&s;ed young gentleman that had pre&s;erved his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>SIR John &s;eemed now quite exhau&s;ted with the different agitations his mind had &s;uffered this evening; and a few minutes after Martin's departure, fell into a profound &s;leep. I wi&s;hed Mr. Greville a good night, and retired to my chamber, where I have ever &s;ince been employed in writing to you.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville told me at parting, that he would &s;it up an hour or two longer,
<PB N="97" REF="96">
in expectation of Martin's return, who, if he is not here by that time, &s;aid he, we may conclude he did not meet Har|ley at Allen's, and is gone after him to the inn.</P>
<P>WELL, we may now conclude that Martin has not &s;ucceeded, for he might have been here long ere this time. I hear Mr. Greville cro&s;&s;ing the gallery, to go to his own chamber, &s;o he has given up all hope. He calls to me as he pa&s;&s;es by my door, &s;eeing a light &s;till in my chamber.&mdash;Sure he has heard &s;ome news.</P>
<P>THIS is what Mr. Greville told me through the door, for I would not open it, being all undre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>MARTIN has &s;ent a man home with the hor&s;e he rode out with; and in a note to Mr. Greville informs him, that Mr. Harley had called at Allen's, and got his hand dre&s;&s;ed, which he had hurt
<PB N="98" REF="97">
by a fall from his hor&s;e, and immedi|ately afterwards &s;et out for the inn. Thither Martin followed; and hearing that Mr. Harley was gone away a quar|ter of an hour before in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, he thought he could not do a more ac|ceptable piece of &s;ervice to his ma&s;ter than to follow him, and endeavour to overtake him: accordingly he ordered po&s;t-hor&s;es and a guide, and was ju&s;t ready to &s;et out when his me&s;&s;enger came away. Mr. Greville added, in a melancholy accent, that he feared all this would end at la&s;t in di&s;appointment and regret. Indeed I fear &s;o too, and am in pain for my uncle, who will be mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly afflicted: &s;o now, my dear Euphemia, being not too happy to &s;leep, I will wi&s;h you a good night, and retire to bed.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI. MISS HARLEY, IN CONTINUATION.</HEAD>
<P>I ROSE early this morning, and had the &s;atisfaction to hear that my uncle had had a good night, and was &s;till a&s;leep. Mr. Greville being al&s;o up, and in my uncle's library, I joined him there. He was beginning to rally me on the &s;ubject of Mr. Harley; but pre|&s;ently altered his tone, being &s;trongly apprehen&s;ive that the youth would be on board, and the &s;hip failed before Martin could overtake him.</P>
<P>'Poor fellow!' &s;aid he with a &s;igh, <Q>he is too good to be a favourite with Fortune, who &s;eldom be&s;tows any
<PB N="100" REF="99">
thing upon the virtuous, becau&s;e &s;he knows &s;he cannot bribe them with her gifts.</Q></P>
<P>MY uncle having &s;ent to de&s;ire we would drink our chocolate by his bed|&s;ide, we attended him immediately. He was very low &s;pirited, having heard from his valet that Martin was not returned. Mr. Greville read his billet to him, which was not calculated to remove his fears of the bad &s;ucce&s;s of his expedition. He was full of unea&s;y reflections; he railed at fortune, he railed at him&s;elf, but &s;till he was more inclined to find fault with his &s;tars than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>MR. Greville put him in mind of the great danger he had &s;o lately e&s;caped, by means &s;o unlikely and unexpected.</P>
<P>'YES,' replied my uncle, <Q>my life is pre&s;erved, but he who pre&s;erved it is out of the reach of my gratitude, which will be a continual &s;ource of
<PB N="101" REF="100">
vexation and regret to me. The fa|vours I receive,</Q> pur&s;ued he in a pee|vi&s;h tone, <Q>are &s;o hu&s;banded, that I cannot recover an eye but by lo&s;ing a leg; my cau&s;es of complaint never cea&s;e, they only change their places.</Q></P>
<P>WE have had a melancholy day of it; I never &s;aw my uncle &s;o fretful and im|patient: he recals every circum&s;tance to his mind that is likely to increa&s;e his remor&s;e for his unkindne&s;s to Mr. Harley. He reprobates his own chur|li&s;h conduct at the inn, where he fir&s;t &s;aw him, and received &s;o &s;trong a proof of the genero&s;ity and &s;weetne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, which I repaid, &s;aid he, by a tyrannous exertion of the power I had to make him mi&s;:erable. I mu&s;t ever de&s;pi&s;e and hate my&s;elf for it.</P>
<P>'COME, come,' &s;aid Mr. Greville, <Q>we mu&s;t not &s;uffer you to be too &s;e|vere a cen&s;urer of your&s;elf; a man &s;hews him&s;elf greater by being capable
<PB N="102" REF="101">
of owning a fault, than by being in|capable of committing it.</Q></P>
<P>'I WOULD repair that fault,' replied my uncle impatiently, <Q>and fortune puts it out of my power&mdash;it is this that makes me wretched.</Q> His phy&s;ician was &s;urpri&s;ed when he vi&s;ited him to|day to find him &s;o much wor&s;e. He &s;aid he had a con&s;iderable degree of fever; he &s;eemed unwilling to take any medicines, telling him the danger he had e&s;caped, which he could not do without &s;ighing deeply &s;everal times.</P>
<P>DR. Irwin told him he would carry his pre&s;criptions him&s;elf to the apothecary, &s;ee them made up, and &s;end them by one of his own &s;ervants; and this expe|dient has made us ea&s;y on that head. But as we have no tidings yet of Mar|tin, and my uncle apparently &s;uffers in his health from the inquietude of his mind, we are under great apprehen&s;ions on his account. Mr. Greville utterly
<PB N="103" REF="102">
condemns his too great &s;en&s;ibility on this occa&s;ion. The be&s;t virtues, he told him, when in exce&s;s, partake &s;o much of vice, that even extreme right is no better than extreme wrong. My uncle an&s;wer|ed peevi&s;hly, that his philo&s;ophy was very un&s;ea&s;onable; and turning him&s;elf in his bed, &s;eemed as if he was de&s;irous of taking &s;ome re&s;t; but I really believe he &s;ought only to indulge his melancholy reflections without interruption.</P>
<P>MR. Greville walked into the garden, and I retired to my chamber, and wrote thus far. I am now going down to make him &s;ome tea. &mdash;No news of Martin yet.</P>
<P>AT NIGHT.</P>
<P>MR. Greville being obliged to vi&s;it a friend in our neighbourhood to-day, I have been reading the whole evening to my uncle, in order to detach his
<PB N="104" REF="103">
thoughts from the &s;ubject of his unea&s;i|ne&s;s. His friend is now with him; he tells him that Martin's not returning is a good &s;ign, for if he had not had hopes of overtaking Mr. Harley, he would have been back ere now. There is &s;ome probability in this; but my uncle is &s;o out of humour with him&s;elf, that he ad|mits of nothing which may tend to re|lieve his di&s;quiet.</P>
<P>WHAT an enormous packet you will receive this time! but I am willing to keep it open while our &s;u&s;pen&s;e conti|nues, that you may either rejoice or grieve with us for the event. I wi&s;h, yet dread, to have a letter from you&mdash;your next will probaby fix the very mo|ment of your departure. It is late; and with this &s;ad expectation on my mind I will go to bed, I cannot &s;ay to re&s;t.</P>
<P>WELL, my dear Euphemia, Martin is returned. Has he brought back Mr.
<PB N="105" REF="104">
Harley? you a&s;k: he has, but not to us. This morning, as I was going into my uncle's chamber, I met Mr. Gre|ville, who, beckoning to me to come to one of the gallery windows, which look|ed out into the court-yard, &s;hewed me Martin ju&s;t arrived, alone, and looking melancholy. We were in doubt whe|ther we &s;hould let him &s;ee my uncle immediately, till we had prepared him for the ill news he brought. But he, who had already been informed that he was come, rang his bell impetuou&s;ly, upon which we both went into his chamber.</P>
<P>'So,' &s;aid he, as &s;oon as he &s;aw us, <Q>Martin is come, and alone it &s;eems: it is as I expected. Did ever any thing happen according to my wi&s;h?</Q></P>
<P>MARTIN coming in, put a &s;top to the&s;e fretful complaints; but, as it &s;hould &s;eem, he was afraid to a&s;k him any que&s;tions, for he &s;aid not a word
<PB N="106" REF="105">
to him. Upon which Mr. Greville &s;aid, <Q>I am &s;orry to &s;ee you are come alone, friend.</Q></P>
<P>'I AM &s;orry too, Sir,' replied Mar|tin; 'and Mr. Harley hopes, Sir,' ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his ma&s;ter, <Q>when you know his rea&s;ons, you will have the goodne&s;s to excu&s;e him.</Q></P>
<P>'YOU have &s;een him then,' cried my uncle impatiently, <Q>and he has refu&s;ed to come: well, I might have expected this. But did he receive my invitation with di&s;dain&mdash;did he expre&s;s any bit|terne&s;s again&s;t me?</Q></P>
<P>'OH, Sir,' &s;aid Martin, <Q>I wi&s;h you could have &s;een with what re&s;pect he received your Honour's letter. At the very fir&s;t words he read of it, his face &s;eemed all in a glow. He read it over, I believe, twenty times; and ki&s;&s;ing it re&s;pectfully before he put it in his pocket, I ob&s;erved his eyes full
<PB N="107" REF="106">
of tears. I ventured to &s;ay to him, May I hope, Sir, you will lay a&s;ide all thoughts of your intended voyage, and return with me to the Hall?</Q></P>
<P><Q>"CAN you doubt it, my good friend?" &s;aid he; "if you were not &s;o much fa|tigued as I &s;ee you are, I would this moment &s;et out with you, for I &s;hall think every moment an age till I can throw my&s;elf at the feet of your noble ma&s;ter, to thank him for the unmerited goodne&s;s he expre&s;&s;es for me in this letter." He then took it out of his pocket again, and read it over half a dozen times, I believe.</Q></P>
<P>'BUT why is he not here?' interrupt|ed my uncle with his u&s;ual impatience; 'where is he&mdash;when &s;hall I &s;ee him?'</P>
<P>'SIR,' replied Martin, <Q>he is gone to his father's.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="107">'How!' interrupted my uncle, <Q>gone to his fathers'!</Q></P>
<P>'OH, Sir!' re&s;umed Martin, <Q>the poor young gentleman heard the mo&s;t melancholy piece of news when he came to the Ro&s;e-Inn la&s;t night, where we only &s;topped till fre&s;h hor&s;es were put to the chai&s;e. I walked out with him into the inn-yard, to ha&s;ten them, when a country fellow e&s;pying him, camerunning up to him, crying "Ma&s;|ter Harley, I am glad to &s;ee you, faith! What, you have heard the &s;ad news then. &mdash;But you mu&s;t make ha&s;te, I can tell you that, or you will not &s;ee your father alive; he was ju&s;t giving up the gho&s;t when I came from&mdash; and that is five or &s;ix hours ago."</Q></P>
<P>'OH, Sir!' pur&s;ued Martin, wiping his eyes&mdash;<Q>I &s;hall never forget the &s;ad condition poor young Harley was in; I had ju&s;t time to catch him in my arms, where he lay, without &s;en&s;e or

<P>SIR John is &s;o well recovered, that he took an airing this morning in his chariot.

<P>MARTIN is returned. Dr. Harley lived two hours after the arrival of his beloved &s;on.

<P>THE family are in great affliction. Mr. Harley has wrote a few lines to my uncle, which &s;eem to plea&s;e him greatly.

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII. MRS. NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>I RETURNED la&s;t night from an|other vi&s;it to Lord L.'s. I could not re&s;olve to leave England without vi&s;it|ing once more the place where the dear remains of my mother are depo&s;ited. As I was leaving the church I met Mr. Neville, who was ju&s;t arrived at Lord L.'s &s;eat, in order to conduct me home; and hearing to whatplace I was gone, came him&s;elf to fetch me. My mind, &s;oftened by the tender, melancholy ideas which the &s;ight of my loved mother's tomb in&s;pired, was &s;o &s;en&s;ibly affected with the obliging &s;olicitude of my hu&s;band, that I flew to meet him with a tran&s;port, which was in&s;tantly repre&s;&s;ed by the au|&s;terity
<PB N="115" REF="114">
of his looks, and the har&s;hne&s;s of his reproofs, for the indulgence of a grief which he treats almo&s;t as a crime. There is no doubt but he meant well; and this &s;everity was an effect of his con|cern for me: but he has &s;o little deli|cacy, is &s;o ungracious, that he converts even the be&s;t intentions into offences, by his unfortunate manner of expre&s;&s;ing them.</P>
<P>THIS meeting, therefore, as you may well imagine, did not contribute to calm my mind. I came home &s;uffi|ciently mortified and dejected; but the &s;ociety of my dear Mrs. Ben&s;on, her wi&s;e rea&s;onings, and tender &s;oothings, re&s;tored me to &s;ome degree of tran|quillity.</P>
<P>YOU have made me a mo&s;t accept|able pre&s;ent in the young per&s;on who has the honour to be recommended by you. Oppre&s;&s;ion has ever been, in my opinion, a &s;ufficient ground for protec|tion;
<PB N="116" REF="115">
but the te&s;timony you give of her merit, and her own engaging appear|ance and manner, will &s;ecure her a large &s;hare of my kindne&s;s and e&s;teem. Her &s;ituation with me &s;hall, in every re&s;pect, be made as agreeable to her as you would wi&s;h. Mrs. Ben&s;on is much plea&s;ed with her; &s;he is her bedfellow, and they are very &s;eldom a&s;under.</P>
<P>I HAVE got your &s;econd packet; my hopes, my wi&s;es, my expectations, are an&s;wered&mdash;you will be the wife of Mr. Harley. Excellent young man! but he is, as you ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, above all prai&s;e. He is worthy of you, my friend, lovely as you are in per&s;on and mind.</P>
<P>SIR John Harley's character ri&s;es greatly upon me in your agreeable nar|rative&mdash;he has acted both a ju&s;t and a generous part. You have painted him with great force; I &s;ee him in all the turns and changes of his temper, and in
<PB N="117" REF="116">
every view he is plea&s;ing. Your gay philo&s;opher, your lively, yet &s;ententious Mr, Greville, was in my opinion much to blame, when he placed the mo&s;t amiable virtue of the mind in the num|ber of its maladies and infirmities. Sir John's &s;en&s;ibility is certainly very great; and if it be nece&s;&s;ary, as &s;ome have &s;aid, that limits and bounds &s;hould be &s;et in all ca&s;es, they cannot be unfit in acts of acknowledgment. If there be a fault oppo&s;ite to ingratiude, he has fallen into it; and thus, by the exce&s;s, he has avoided the defect; but the de|fect is &s;o horrid, and the exce&s;s &s;o beau|tiful, that he mu&s;t be a rigid morali&s;t indeed who calls it an infirmity.</P>
<P>AND now, my dear Maria, that I &s;ee you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much happine&s;s at pre&s;ent, and &s;o much greater in pro|&s;pect, I &s;hall with the le&s;s reluctance tell you, that our &s;hip will ab&s;olutely &s;ail within the&s;e ten days. All the for|titude I can boa&s;t would have been
<PB N="118" REF="117">
&s;carce &s;ufficient to have &s;upported my &s;pirits under this &s;eparation, if I had left you in that unea&s;y &s;tate of mind which your delicacy but half unveiled, but which your candor and amiable &s;impli|city made but too apparent to an ob&s;er|vation intere&s;ted like mine.</P>
<P>YES, my dear friend, you have loved Mr. Harley all this time; and your gentle mind has had &s;ome &s;evere con|flicts to &s;u&s;tain between your inclination for him, and the obedience you owed Sir John, who, as your uncle and be|nefactor, had a double title to it. The virtues of Mr. Harley have made this &s;acrifice no longer nece&s;&s;ary, and that which ju&s;tifies your choice &s;ecures you the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its object.</P>
<P>I EARNESTLY intreat you, my Maria, not to &s;uffer the pre&s;ent &s;un&s;hine of your fortune to be clouded with your appre|hen&s;ions for me. Our &s;eparation is the only circum&s;tance that ought to give
<PB N="119" REF="118">
you &s;ome concern, and that is common to us both. It is true, I have but little contentment but what I derive from rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy; that &s;ort of phi|lo&s;ophy I mean which teaches us &s;ubmi&s;|mi&s;ion to the will of Heaven. I &s;ee no|thing terrible in this long voyage but my ab&s;ence from you. I apprehend nothing wor&s;e than what has already happened to me; and I will never believe that ill fortune will follow me &s;o far, or that it is po&s;&s;ible for one to fall, who already &s;tands &s;o low. You may render ab&s;ence tolerable to me by fre|quent letters. Continue your charming narratives; while I read your lively de|&s;criptions, I &s;ee, I conver&s;e with you&mdash;I partake your fears, I am elevated with your hopes, I &s;ympathi&s;e with your &s;or|rows, and enjoy your happine&s;s.</P>
<P>AS for me, it will be the chief com|fort of my life to write to you, and make you acquainted with all the events of it. I propo&s;e to devote &s;ome part of
<PB N="120" REF="119">
every day to this dear <HI>conver&s;e</HI> I will call it, which will make you pre&s;ent with me; and, although I cannot hope to give you equal entertainment, yet I will be punctual if not liberal, and &s;end you that which I promi&s;ed, if I cannot &s;end you what I would. Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX. MISS HARLEY TO MRS. NEVILLE.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Greville is ju&s;t come from Dr. Harley's afflicted family, where he has been to pay a con&s;olatory vi&s;it. He has brought a letter from Mr. Harley to my uncle, which he keeps to him&s;elf. I am extremely glad that the youth, in accepting my uncle's, liberal pre&s;ent, di&s;covers nothing of that pride of &s;pirit which appeared in that letter of his to me upon a former occa&s;ion. I men|tioned this circum&s;tance to Mr. Gre|ville, as what had given me &s;ome appre|hen&s;ions.</P>
<P>'YOU are right,' &s;aid he, <Q>for no|thing is more likely to create di&s;tru&s;t in
<PB N="122" REF="121">
a new reconciliation than to &s;hew a &s;hy|ne&s;s to be obliged to tho&s;e with whom we are reconciled. But Harley, you know, is now his &s;on by adoption; and no I think of it,</Q> pur&s;ued he, with a &s;ly leer, <Q>you are too ju&s;t not to have this worthy young man's intere&s;t ex|tremely at heart; would it not be more for his advantage, think you, for Sir John to call him his nephew than his &s;on?</Q></P>
<P>I BLUSHED like a fool; but recollect|ing my&s;elf, I an&s;wered himgravely, <Q>that he had acted like a father by me, who was only his niece; and that which|&s;oever of tho&s;e characters he cho&s;e to con&s;ider Mr. Harley in, I did not doubt but he would &s;hew him&s;elf equally affectionate.</Q></P>
<P>I WAS afraid of the archne&s;s I &s;aw ri&s;ing in his looks; therefore, to prevent his mi&s;chievous raillery, I a&s;ked him a great many que&s;tions concerning Mrs. Har|ley
<PB N="123" REF="122">
and the young ladies; and he let me into a &s;ecret which &s;urpri&s;ed me greatly. Mrs. Harley was, it &s;eems, bred up by her mother in the Roman Catholic re|ligion; and although obliged, on ac|count of her hu&s;band's profe&s;&s;ion, to conceal her principles while he lived, yet being a bigot to its tenets, &s;he is de|termined to &s;pend the remainder of her days in a convent in France, where &s;he propo&s;es to complete the education of her daughters. I believe this &s;cheme will meet with &s;ome oppo&s;ition from Sir John, who, I know, intends to take care of them.</P>
<P>To-DAY at dinner my uncle told me, that he expected a vi&s;it from Mr. Har|ley in a day or two; and he de&s;ired me to give orders to the hou&s;ekeeper to prepare that apartment for him which was formerly mine; for &s;ince Lady Harley's death I have, by his expre&s;s command, occupied her's. I an&s;wered, he&s;itatingly, 'Yes, Sir;' for both the
<PB N="124" REF="123">
gentlemen threw me into &s;uch confu&s;ion by their fa&s;cinating looks, that I &s;carce knew what I &s;aid.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the cloth was removed I retired to my own apartment; in&s;tead of giving the hou&s;ekeeper orders my&s;elf, I bid my maid tell her, her ma&s;ter wanted her. She received his directions, and came to tell me, with great joy, that we were to have Mr. Harley for a gue&s;t.</P>
<P><Q>WE are all debtors to this charming young gentleman,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q>for the life of our good ma&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>NOW, my dear Euphemia, no one has a higher &s;en&s;e of this obligation than I have; but my &s;ituation is a little aukward. Mr, Greville's raillery, and my uncle's fixed looks on me, which &s;eem as if they were exploring the in|mo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of my heart, often di&s;tre&s;s me greatly&mdash;I e&s;cape from them when I can.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="124">I AM &s;ummoned this moment to make tea. I wi&s;h Mr. Greville was gone&mdash;I never thought his company tire&s;ome before. Do you not think it is indelicate in him my Euphemia, to pur&s;ue me thus with his raillery?&mdash;So! a &s;econd &s;ummons&mdash;I mu&s;t go.</P>
<P>SIR John and his friend imagined a fine &s;cheme to divert them&s;elves with my embarra&s;&s;ment. Who do you think I &s;aw upon my returning to the room where I had left them together?&mdash;Even Mr. Harley, whom I had been taught not to expect the&s;e two days. But this mi&s;chievous de&s;ign did not &s;ucceed en|tirely to their wi&s;h; for, although my &s;urpri&s;e was indeed very great at this unexpected &s;ight of him, yet I felt my confu&s;ion decrea&s;e, in proportion as the tender melancholy in his looks fixed my attention upon the recent cau&s;e.</P>
<P>A TRANSIENT blu&s;h over&s;pread his cheeks on my fir&s;t appearance; but
<PB N="126" REF="125">
in&s;tantly gave place to that palene&s;s which the death of a father, whom he had loved exce&s;&s;ively, &s;eemed to have planted there.</P>
<P>HE approached me with an air of deep re&s;pect, but with a &s;edatene&s;s which he borrowed from his melancholy &s;itua|tion, and made me a &s;hort compliment; which I received, and an&s;wered, without any other emotion than what aro&s;e from a participation in a grief &s;o ju&s;t and &s;o affecting. He led me to my chair; and re&s;uming his &s;eat, which was next my uncle, he continued his di&s;cour&s;e upon &s;ome indifferent matters, which my com|ing in had interrupted.</P>
<P>SIR John and Mr. Greville were evi|dently di&s;appointed, that this fir&s;t inter|view had pa&s;&s;ed over without any of that di&s;compo&s;ure which would have laid a foundation for &s;ome future raillery. I enjoyed their di&s;appointment, I confe&s;s, and &s;aw, with &s;ome little triumph, Mr.
<PB N="127" REF="126">
Greville's arch looks, and my uncle's &s;ignificant glances, give place to a &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s, which was better &s;uited to the circum&s;tances of our young gue&s;t.</P>
<P>THE evening pa&s;&s;ed over very agree|ably; my uncle &s;eemed delighted with Mr. Harley's conver&s;ation; for al|though he was far from making an often|tatlous di&s;play of his powers of plea&s;ing, yet, through all his mode&s;ty, there ap|peared a fund of knowledge and an ele|gance of expre&s;&s;ion, which captivated the attention, and gave an advantageous idea of his under&s;tanding and improve|ments.</P>
<P>HE took occa&s;ion once to mention his great obligations to my uncle; he em|ployed but few words; for he &s;eemed well aware of the ju&s;tne&s;s of that ob&s;er|vation, that the dignity of truth is wounded by much profe&s;&s;ing: but his look and accent were &s;o affecting, that Sir John &s;eemed touched to the &s;oul,
<PB N="128" REF="127">
and gra&s;ping his hand with an eager pre&s;&s;ure&mdash;</P>
<P>'TALK not to me of obligations,' &s;aid he, <Q>your worth out&s;trips all my power of rewarding.</Q></P>
<P>MR. Greville was cruel enough, at that moment, to ca&s;t a glance full of mean|ing, at me, to add to the confu&s;ion with which I was overwhelmed. I perceived, as &s;oon as I was able to look up, that this mi&s;chievous look had not e&s;caped Mr. Harley's ob&s;ervation: his face was covered by a deep blu&s;h. With a timid and di&s;concerted air he rai&s;ed my uncle's hand, which &s;till held his fa&s;t cla&s;ped, to his lips, and told him, in a low but ardent accent, that it &s;hould be the bu|&s;ine&s;s of his life to de&s;erve his good opi|nion.</P>
<P>OUR common per&s;ecutor now &s;eemed to pity the embarra&s;&s;ment he had occa|&s;ioned, and in&s;tantly began a conver&s;a|tion on indifferent matters.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="128">I RETIRED early to my own apartment, to be at liberty to continue my letter to you. It was late, and I was &s;till en|gaged in this dear employment, when Mrs. Groves, who had carried the can|dle before Mr. Harley when he retired to his chamber, where &s;he left him with Martin, who was ordered to attend him, came into my room, and begging pardon for her intru&s;ion, broke into the mo&s;t extravagant prai&s;es of the young gentleman.</P>
<P>THIS good woman loves to talk, and &s;ays every thing that comes into her head, without regarding time, or place, or per&s;ons; and &s;he is indulged in this liberty on account of her long-tried rec|titude and fidelity.</P>
<P>'DO you know, Madam,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>that I have found out that there is a great likene&s;s between you and Mr. Harley. He has the very air of your countenance, your fine large eyes,</Q> &s;aid
<PB N="130" REF="129">
the flatterer, <Q>and dimpled mouth; only his complexion is not like yours &mdash;his is a lovely brown, and yours, to be &s;ure, is as fair as alaba&s;ter. I think he re&s;embles you too in the air of his per&s;on&mdash;no di&s;paragement to you neither, Madam, for I think he is one of the genteele&s;t young men I ever &s;aw.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WELL, but I mu&s;t tell you &s;ome|thing, Madam: You mu&s;t know, that as we pa&s;&s;ed through that room which was formerly your dre&s;&s;ing-room, your picture, that hangs over the chimney, took his eye in a minute; well, what did he do, but, with great eagerne&s;s, he takes one of the candles out of my hand, goes up clo&s;e to it, and there he s;tood looking and looking, as if he could never be tired. So I made bold to &s;ay, Sir, that is my young lady's picture; it was drawn when &s;he was about fourteen: do you think it is like her?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="130">'IT is like your young lady,' &s;aid he, <Q>but &s;he is va&s;tly improved &s;ince this was painted.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WELL, Madam, he &s;taid looking and looking at it &s;o long, till I was down|right tired with &s;tanding; at la&s;t, he begged my pardon, and returned me the candle; and, as &s;ure as you are alive, Madam, he fetched a deep &s;igh when he took his eyes off it,</Q></P>
<P>'WELL, Mrs. Groves,' &s;aid I &s;miling, <Q>what is all this to the purpo&s;e?</Q></P>
<P>'WHY, Madam,' replied &s;he, <Q>what I <HI>refer</HI> from all this is, that Mr. Har|ley has certainly a great kindne&s;s for you, and that you would make a charming couple.</Q></P>
<P>NOW, my dear Euphemia, I do not doubt but the wi&s;e a&s;&s;embly of the hou&s;ekeeper's room have &s;ettled already all the preliminaries of this match, and

as good as concluded upon it. I was un|willing to hear any more upon the &s;ub|ject; &s;o I called my maid to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in undre&s;&s;ing, and bade the loquacious hou&s;ekeeper good night.</P>
<P>AND a thou&s;and thou&s;and times good night to you, my dear friend, whom I always &s;ee in my dreams, but with me|lancholy omens; for, alas! you are torn from me; the di&s;tance between us &s;eems to increa&s;e, and &s;ometimes I lo&s;e fight of you entirely.

<P>MR. Harley has left us, and I am ju&s;t e&s;caped from that uncea&s;ing teazer, Mr. Greville, to give my dear Euphemia an account of what has pa&s;&s;ed during this intere&s;ting day.</P>
<P>AT breakfa&s;t, my uncle a&s;ked Mr. Harley if it would be inconvenient to him to &s;tay another day. The youth replied, that a longer ab&s;ence at this time would be &s;everely felt by his af|flicted family.</P>
<P><Q>WELL then, you &s;hall go, my dear Edward,</Q> &s;aid my uncle, <Q>my hor&s;es

and groom &s;hall attend you, unle&s;s you choo&s;e to have the po&s;t-chariot.</Q> Mr. Harley thanked him, and &s;aid, as the day was fair he would rather ride.</P>
<P>'YOU will reach&mdash;,' &s;aid my uncle, <Q>before dark, though you do not &s;et out the&s;e two hours; therefore,</Q> pur&s;ued he, ri&s;ing, <Q>as I wi&s;h to have a little di&s;cour&s;e with you in private be|fore you leave us, I will expect you in my library as &s;oon as you have fini&s;hed your breakfa&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>MR. Harley, who ro&s;e up when my uncle did, told him he was ready to at|tend him then; and accordingly followed him, after bowing to me with an air &s;o timid and embarra&s;&s;ed, as threw me, I know not why, into confu&s;ion like|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>I DURST not rai&s;e my eyes to Mr. Greville, who, I &s;uppo&s;ed, was making his malicious ob&s;ervations; &s;o both of
<PB N="135" REF="134">
us continued ridiculou&s;ly &s;ilent for &s;everal minutes, when he thought fit to relieve me, by de&s;iring me to give him another di&s;h of tea. I did &s;o; and he then a&s;ked me gravely, if I could gue&s;s what was likely to be the &s;ubject of Sir John's conver&s;ation with Mr. Harley?</P>
<P>I TOLD him I really could not.</P>
<P><Q>AND have you no curio&s;ity about it?</Q> &s;aid he.</P>
<P>'NOT much,' I an&s;wered.</P>
<P>'NOT much!' repeated he; <Q>this in|difference is not very obliging to Mr. Harley.</Q></P>
<P>'YOU are mi&s;taken, Sir,' replied I, <Q>I am not indifferent to any thing that concerns Mr. Harley; his intere&s;ts will always be of &s;ome con&s;equence to me, e&s;teeming him &s;o ju&s;tly as I do. But I have no anxiety on my mind
<PB N="136" REF="135">
on account of this private conference, and therefore little curio&s;ity, becau&s;e I have no doubt of the greatne&s;s and permanency of my uncle's affection for him, as it is founded upon his me|rit, and the grateful &s;en&s;e he has of his obligations to him.</Q></P>
<P>THE openne&s;s of my an&s;wer di&s;con|certed Mr. Greville, who, I perceived, expected I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething that would give him an opportunity of teaz|ing me, as was his cu&s;tom. He looked at me, I thought, with complacency; and that moment my uncle called out, <HI>Greville.</HI></P>
<P>'Now,' &s;aid he, ri&s;ing to go to him, <Q>I &s;hall know all; and to puni&s;h you for your re&s;erve, I will not tell you a word of what I know.</Q></P>
<P>'YES you will,' replied I, laughing, <Q>when I have curio&s;ity enough to a&s;k you.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="136">HE went to my uncle, and I took my u&s;ual walk upon the terrace, where, in about half an hour afterwards, I was joined by Mr. Greville and Mr. Har|ley.

He was &s;ilent too; and in this &s;tupid way we followed Mr. Greville, who led us from one walk to another, pointing out to Mr. Harley &s;omewhat or other to ad|mire in the di&s;po&s;ition of the grounds, which, you know, are laid out in the mo&s;t beautiful ta&s;te imaginable.</P>
<P>ALL on a &s;udden he &s;eemed to recol|lect &s;omething he had to &s;ay to Sir John; and telling us he would be with us again in a few minutes, left us to|gether.</P>
<P>THIS &s;illy contrivance of leaving me alone with Mr. Harley, was not calcu|lated to le&s;&s;en that unaccountable em|barra&s;&s;ment
<PB N="138" REF="137">
into which his coming had thrown me. I was impatient to free my&s;elf from this aukward &s;ituation; and therefore, pretending to be apprehen&s;ive that it would rain, I mended my pace, in order to get as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible into the hou&s;e; but he re&s;pectfully retaining me, begged me not to have the cruelty to deprive him of the only opportunity he had yet had of &s;peaking to me alone. I then walked &s;lower, but &s;till towards the hou&s;e, though he &s;ought to turn my &s;teps to another path.</P>
<P>'THE tide of favour here,' &s;aid he, <Q>flows &s;o &s;trongly for me, as might in|deed carry my hopes very far, did not your coldne&s;s, Madam, or rather aver|&s;ion, reduce me to de&s;pair.</Q></P>
<P>'MY aver&s;ion,' &s;aid I, <Q>Mr. Harley how can you imagine that I have any aver&s;ion to you&mdash;you who have &s;o ju&s;t a right to my e&s;teem?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="138"><Q>AND am I honoured with your e&s;|teem, Madam,</Q> replied he eagerly; <Q>and may I pre&s;ume to hope that the tender, the ardent pa&s;&s;ion, with which you in&s;pired me the fir&s;t moment I beheld you, is not di&s;plea&s;ing to you? Speak, I conjure you, Madam,</Q> pur|&s;ued he, <Q>relieve me from this agony of doubt&mdash;&s;uffer me not to depart un|certain of my fate.</Q></P>
<P>BEING &s;till out of &s;ight of the hou&s;e, he threw him&s;elf at my feet, holding one of my hands, which he &s;everal times pre&s;&s;ed to his lips, in &s;pite of my endea|vours to withdraw it.</P>
<P>THIS liberty was not altogether agree|able, any more than the parade of his po&s;ture, &s;till kneeling. I moved a &s;tep back; and laughing, as I did once be|fore on the &s;ame occa&s;ion, told him, that I &s;uppo&s;ed he had lately read Ca&s;|&s;andra and the grand Cyrus, for his lan|guage
<PB N="140" REF="139">
and manners had all the air of an Orondates.</P>
<P>I CONFESS to you, my dear Euphe|mia, that I was willing to relieve the embarra&s;&s;ment this very pa&s;&s;ionate ad|dre&s;s had thrown me into, by a little raillery, which detached my reflexions upon the &s;illy figure I mu&s;t have made during this &s;hort &s;cene; but I was much concerned when I perceived the effect my ill-judged gaiety had upon him. &mdash;He dropped my hand &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively, and ri&s;ing, bowed low, a&s;king me pardon for the liberty he had taken in declar|ing his &s;entiments &s;o freely. He was now convinced, he &s;aid, that my indif|ference, or rather di&s;like of him, was not to be overcome; that he could have borne my anger with more fortitude than my &s;corn, by which his pre&s;umption was too &s;everely puni&s;hed to leave him an excu&s;e for ever repeating his of|fence.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="140">I HEARD him &s;igh&mdash;I &s;aw his eyes full of tears; I was &s;hocked, perplexed&mdash;I knew not what to &s;ay to him. I am &s;ure my heart was far from being in that di&s;po&s;ition towards him which he &s;eemed to apprehend. Scorn! good Heaven! Mr. Harley an object of &s;corn! how could a thought &s;o inju|rious to his acknowledged merit ri&s;e in his mind? I wi&s;hed to era&s;e it; but nothing proper to be &s;aid recurred to my mind.</P>
<P>I CONTINUED &s;ilent; and, without at|tending to what I did, walked fa&s;t to|wards the hou&s;e. Doubtle&s;s he under|&s;tood this to be in con&s;equence of my eagerne&s;s to get rid of him; for again I heard him &s;igh deeply; but he &s;poke not a word.</P>
<P>MR. Greville, who was come out again, joined us before either of us per|ceived him. He &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed and vexed at the di&s;order that appeared in
<PB N="142" REF="141">
Mr. Harley's countenance: it was in|deed &s;ufficiently apparent, for at that moment I ventured to ca&s;t my eyes upon him; but in&s;tantly removed them again, being, I own it, greatly affected by the tender di&s;tre&s;s expre&s;&s;ed in every line of his face.</P>
<P>MR. Greville, who heedfully ob&s;erved us both, ca&s;t an upbraiding glance on me; and being now arrived at the hou&s;e, he &s;aid to Mr. Harley, I intend to accompany you a few miles; the hor&s;es are at the gate&mdash;I believe we &s;hall find Sir John there likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>MR. Harley then made me a mo&s;t re|&s;pectful bow; but uttered not a word, nor rai&s;ed his eyes to my face. I curt|&s;eyed al&s;o in &s;ilence, though I am &s;ure I &s;ecretly wi&s;hed him a good journey, and retired to my own apartment, where I have been ever &s;ince.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="142">I HAVE a mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive weight upon my &s;pirits; I dread &s;eeing Mr. Greville again&mdash;I hate his &s;crutinizing looks; but I mu&s;t re&s;olve to meet them; for my maid tells me that dinner is ready to be &s;erved, and that Mr. Gre|ville is returned from his ride. Why did he return? I think he takes root here.&mdash;Well, I mu&s;t go.</P>
<P>MY uncle looked very grave upon me all dinner-time; Mr. Greville was &s;erious and re&s;erved.</P>
<P>WHEN I drank my uncle's health, he took no other notice of me than by a bow lower than u&s;ual, without his wonted &s;mile of complacency. Ju&s;t as I was ri&s;ing from table, my maid brought me a letter from you. I took it out of her hand with a vi&s;ible emotion, I &s;uppo&s;e, for the gentlemen &s;miled, I a&s;ked leave to retire to read it; and, without waiting for an an&s;wer, flew up &s;tairs.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="143">OH! my Euphemia, what do you tell me? a few days more, and I &s;hall be &s;eparated from you, perhaps, for ever. Have I &s;o anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hed for this letter, which, when it came, was to pierce my heart with its fatal tidings? Do not chide me, my dear friend, this &s;troke, though long expected, falls heavy on me. I mu&s;t lay down my pen, my tears blind me; when I am more compo&s;ed I will fini&s;h my letter.</P>
<P>I have pa&s;&s;ed a &s;leeple&s;s night:
<Q>Thought followed thought, and tear &s;ucceeded tear.</Q>
But I am now, if not ea&s;y, yet re&s;igned, &s;ince to remedile&s;s evils nothing but pa|tience can be oppo&s;ed. But be a&s;&s;ured, neither time nor ab&s;ence will be able to weaken my affection&mdash;Your idea will always be pre&s;ent with me.

our being together. You &s;hall have letters from me by every conveyance; and thus, though oceans roll between us, our minds may often meet and con|ver&s;e with each other.</P>
<P>YOUR picture travels continually from one room to another; whereever I am likely to &s;pend mo&s;t of my time, thither it is removed; but this is not &s;ufficient, I would have you always near me. I conjure you then, my dear friend, &s;it immediately to &mdash; for a miniature. You will &s;till have time enough, if you &s;et about it in|&s;tantly.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI. MISS HARLEY TO MRS. NEVILLE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE loved Mr. Harley all this time you &s;ay, my dear Euphemia; and this circum&s;tance, which has hither|to been a &s;ecret to my&s;elf, you have, it &s;eems, di&s;covered, from my first men|tion of him. I will not call your pene|tration in que&s;tion, nor will you, I am &s;ure, doubt my candour when I declare, that the &s;entimental entertained for Mr. Harley, and which I freely avowed to you, appeared to me to be, &s;uch as every friend to virtue mu&s;t feel for one &s;o duly virtuous.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="146">YOU call him an excellent young man; and &s;o he certainly is. It was natural to wi&s;h well to the worth I e&s;|teemed&mdash;to feel for his &s;ituation, and to be anxious for his pro&s;perity. I never thought it nece&s;&s;ary to que&s;tion my own heart about the nature of &s;entiments which appeared to me &s;o rea&s;onable and &s;o ju&s;t.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER a &s;aying that once fell from you&mdash;<Q>A young woman has pa&s;&s;|ed over the fir&s;t bounds of re&s;erved|ne&s;s, who allows her&s;elf to think &s;he is in love.</Q> Nor would your delicacy have permitted you to &s;peak &s;o plainly to me on this &s;ubject, if you had not &s;uppo&s;ed, that from the great and ju&s;t degree of favour Mr. Harley is now in with my uncle, his preten&s;ions to me will be authori&s;ed by his con&s;ent; with|out it I am &s;ure, however favourably I might think of him, he could never have hoped for &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="147">BUT although, according to you, my <HI>inclinations</HI> and duty are now reconciled, you are not likely to leave me &s;o happy as you imagined; for my uncle is of|fended, Mr. Greville reproaches me, and Mr. Harley perhaps hates me; and all the&s;e misfortunes I have drawn upon my&s;elf with the mo&s;t innocent intentions imaginable.</P>
<P>SOME time ago I &s;uffered in my uncle's opinion for being willing to do ju&s;tice to the merits of this young man, when I thought he was har&s;hly u&s;ed; and I was &s;u&s;pected of favouring ad|dre&s;&s;es from the &s;on of his ancient ene|my; and now he reproaches me with caprice, and a tyrannical u&s;e of my power over a per&s;on whom he loves and e&s;teems, and to whom he has the high|e&s;t obligations. In the former ca&s;e I &s;hewed a ready obedience to his will, by giving Mr. Harley an ab&s;olute re|jection; in the latter, whatever my &s;en|timents were with regard to him, I
<PB N="149" REF="148">
thought my&s;elf obliged to act with great re&s;erve, till my uncle was plea&s;ed to de|clare his intentions to me. Mr, Gre|ville calls my conduct, in this in&s;tance, a too &s;crupulous prudence, which does nothing for fear of doing ill. "Your uncle's prejudices, &s;aid he, have all given way to the conviction of his bet|ter judgment; for &s;en&s;ible per&s;ons only ta&s;te of an error, of which the ignorant drink till they are intoxicated. You could not, my dear Mi&s;s Harley, be ig|norant what de&s;igns Sir John entertained in favour of Mr. Harley. Why then treat him with a coldne&s;s that &s;addened all his delightful pro&s;pects?" And he was angry with me in good earne&s;t, for &s;ending his young friend, as he calls Mr. Harley, away in de&s;pair.</P>
<P>IT is no unplea&s;ant thing to &s;ee a phi|lo&s;opher in choler. I only &s;miled at his reproaches, though I could ea&s;ily have ju&s;tified my&s;elf. He was malicious enough to leave me alone with my uncle
<PB N="150" REF="149">
this afternoon, who he knew was re|&s;olved to chide me; and accordingly he began to rail at the caprice, the ob&s;tinacy and incon&s;i&s;tency of our &s;ex, in very &s;evere terms. I was determined not to make any particular application, and li&s;tened to him very patiently, which reduced him to the nece&s;&s;ity of being more explicit.</P>
<P><Q>I HOPED you had been, in a certain degree, free from tho&s;e faults, Maria,</Q> &s;aid he; <Q>but you have convinced me, by your behaviour to Mr. Harley, that you are a very woman; and that to give &s;teadine&s;s to your inclinations, it is nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould meet with oppo&s;ition.</Q></P>
<P>'HERE now,' pur&s;ued he, (without waiting for my an&s;wer, and indeed I had none ready for him) <Q>when, to my &s;hame be it &s;poken, I viewed young Harley in no other light than as the &s;on of an ungrateful man, who had deceiv|ed
<PB N="151" REF="150">
and betrayed me, you were very favourably di&s;po&s;ed towards him, and &s;ome very tender letters pa&s;&s;ed be|tween you.</Q></P>
<P>'OH! Sir,' interrupted I with &s;ome emotion, <Q>is this a candid repre&s;enta|tion of my conduct? You have copies of my letters to Mr. Harley; will they bear &s;uch a comment?</Q></P>
<P>'WELL, well,' re&s;umed Sir John, <Q>letting the letters pa&s;s, if Mr. Harley was indifferent to you, where was the merit of your rejecting him to comply with my unrea&s;onable prejudices? That &s;acrifice, Maria, for &s;o I con&s;i|dered it, redoubled my affection for you; great as it was before, it has been greater &s;ince; but you have &s;poiled all, by your unaccountable be|haviour. Is this young man le&s;s ami|able in your eyes, becau&s;e mine are open to his virtues?</Q></P>
<Q><PB N="152" REF="151">HAS he not de&s;erved you by his noble di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s? and can I do le&s;s for him who &s;aved my life, at a time when it &s;tood between him and happine&s;s, than be&s;tow on him a gift which he values, I am &s;ure, more than my e&s;tate? which mu&s;t be his whe|ther I will or not, &s;ince I have no other heir.</Q>
<P>MY dear uncle &s;poke all this &s;o affec|tionately, that I was melted into tears. He mi&s;took the cau&s;e of my emotion; and &s;tarting from his chair, began to pace about the room in great agitation.</P>
<P>I WAS confounded, not being able to gue&s;s at the cau&s;e of this tran&s;port; when &s;uddenly coming up to me, and &s;eizing my hand, he looked earne&s;tly at me for a moment, then exclaimed&mdash;</P>
<Q>IS it po&s;&s;ible! have you really any di&s;|like to Mr. Harley? and mu&s;t I be di&s;|appointed in the plea&s;ing de&s;ign I had
<PB N="153" REF="152">
formed of making my pre&s;erver happy?</Q>
<P>'DISLIKE to Mr. Harley, Sir,' re|plied I, 'No, on the contrary&mdash;' I &s;topped, for his eyes were fixed upon me.</P>
<P>'GO on,' &s;aid he, <Q>your contrary, come.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>EVERY one mu&s;t be a friend to Mr. Harley who knows him,</Q> &s;aid I.</P>
<P>NOW, my dear Euphemia, the di&s;|covery you think you have made coming into my head that moment, I felt my face glow like fire.</P>
<P>'Very well,' &s;aid my uncle, <Q>that blu&s;h is hone&s;ter than your words, and we are friends again, my Maria; &s;o I will an&s;wer for you, &s;ince Mr. Harley is your choice, Sir, he &s;hall be mine; have I hit your meaning?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="153"><Q>You may always depend upon my obedience, Sir,</Q> replied I; <Q>for I am &s;ure you will never command any thing that is not rea&s;onable.</Q></P>
<P>'Mighty well, mighty well,' cried my uncle, in a joyful accent, <Q>I am &s;a|tisfied.</Q> Mr. Greville coming in at that moment &mdash; 'Greville,' &s;aid Sir John, <Q>write to Harley in&s;tantly, tell him, I &s;ay he is a fool.</Q></P>
<P>I hastened out of the room, not being willing to hear more: though, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, my uncle has not, on this occa&s;ion, been inatten|tive to the claims of female delicacy. Here is a prodigious change in my affairs: a happy one I know you will think it. But, alas! that happine&s;s comes clogged with the painful idea of our &s;eparation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXII. MISS HARLEY TO MRS. NEVILLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR EUPHEMIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DISPATCHED my la&s;t letter to the po&s;t, without waiting till I could give you an account of my interview with Mr. Harley, which I expected would &s;oon take place; for a me&s;&s;enger was immediately di&s;patched to him, with a letter from my uncle, which it was probable would &s;oon bring him to the Hall; and indeed he came &s;o early the next morning, that Sir John was not ri&s;en.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="155">By his order, however, he was intro|duced into his bed-chamber, where they had a conference of more than an hour. I had already fini&s;hed my morn|ing walk, when they came together into the garden to meet me, for you know I am an early ri&s;er.</P>
<P>While they were yet at &s;ome di&s;|tance, I could perceive &s;o much heart|felt &s;atisfaction in my uncle's looks, in Mr. Harley's &s;o much joy, which yet &s;eemed checked by a certain timidity that encrea&s;ed as he approached me, that it was ea&s;y to gue&s;s their conver&s;a|tion had been very intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>I summoned up all my courage, in order to conquer my confu&s;ion, and prevent my acting a &s;illy part in the trying &s;cene that was preparing for me; and accordingly I paid my compliments to my uncle, with an air very unembar|ra&s;&s;ed
<PB N="157" REF="156">
as I thought; but when Icurt&s;eyed to Mr. Harley, my half-rai&s;ed eyes were encountered with &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate a glance, at the &s;ame time that he bowed to me with the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect, as quite di&s;concerted me; and I felt that I blu&s;hed, and blu&s;hed the more becau&s;e I felt it.</P>
<P>My uncle did not give me time to recover my&s;elf.</P>
<P>'It is in vain to di&s;&s;emble, Maria,' &s;aid he, eagerly; <Q>I have betrayed your &s;ecret to my young friend here. I have told him, that you have been kind enough to put it in my power to reward his noblene&s;s of mind, and pay him back &s;ome part of the va&s;t debt of gratitude I owe him, by a gift, which, knewing your merit &s;o well as I do, I will call a precious one.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="157">'RECEIVE her hand from me, Harley,' proceeded he; <Q>I promi&s;e you it is not an unwilling one&mdash;Is it, niece?</Q></P>
<P>'If it were, Sir,' &s;aid I, <Q>I am &s;ure you would not give it, nor would I.</Q> I could not bring out another word &mdash;I was half dead with confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Harley, as if remembering my rebuke a day or two before, and fearful of incurring the &s;ame cen&s;ure, received my hand half bending on one knee, but kept it glewed to his lips with &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate an action, that my uncle, willing, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to relieve me, called out laughing&mdash;</P>
<Q>What, have you nothing to &s;ay to her!</Q>
<P><Q>We receive the an&s;wers of oracles, Sir,</Q> replied he, ri&s;ing, in awful &s;ilence; <Q>true devotion is dumb; and all words,</Q> pur&s;ued he, taking
<PB N="159" REF="158">
my uncle's hand, which he ki&s;&s;ed re|&s;pectfully, <Q>would be too weak to paint the exce&s;s of my tran&s;port and acknowledgment.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You have done pretty well now, however,</Q> &s;aid my uncle, &s;till &s;miling, and giving his hand a hearty &s;hake&mdash; 'and now we will go in to breakfa&s;t.'</P>
<P>Just as we were preparing to enter the hou&s;e we perceived Mr. Greville coming to meet us; he drew near, laughing,</P>
<P>'I have rare news for you, Sir John,' &s;aid he; <Q>who do you think is come to breakfa&s;t with you? even the learned and &s;cientific Lady Cornelia Cla&s;&s;ick, with the Diana of our fore&s;ts, the fearle&s;s huntre&s;s Mi&s;s Sandford, who, at the age of forty-five, declares her fixed re&s;olution never to marry, though an Endymion were to court
<PB N="160" REF="159">
her; and boa&s;ts of her wonderful art in keeping the men at a di&s;tance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Alas! to what am I condemned, for two hours at lea&s;t?</Q> &s;aid Sir John.</P>
<P>'Aye,' replied Mr. Greville, <Q>you mu&s;t re&s;olve to be patient; but as for you, Mi&s;s Harley,</Q> pur&s;ued he, <Q>fall upon your knees, and thank me for &s;paring you the mortification of &s;har|ing this tremendous vi&s;it; for I have told her, that you are confined to your chamber with a &s;ore throat, a di&s;order &s;he is infinitely afraid of, &s;o you may breakfa&s;t quietly in your dre&s;&s;ing|room, either alone or with company</Q>, looking at Mr. Harley, who would not venture to under&s;tand this propo&s;al otherwi&s;e than by a &s;peaking look.</P>
<P>I thanked Mr. Greville very cor|dially for the good office he had done me at the expence of his veracity; and, without taking notice of his in&s;inuation
<PB N="161" REF="160">
with regard to my having company to breakfa&s;t with me, I told him, I would employ the happy exemption he had afforded me in writing to you.</P>
<P>He charged me with a thou&s;and thou|&s;and good wi&s;hes for you; and we parted.</P>
<P>Mr. Harley, notwith&s;tanding a little cloud upon his brow, contrived, un&s;een, to ki&s;s my hand with a mighty pa&s;|&s;ionate air; and here have I been ever &s;ince in company with my dear Euphe|mia; but I mu&s;t quit you &s;oon, I &s;up|po&s;e, for my maid tells me the ladies are going. I hear their carriage draw up to the gate&mdash;I mu&s;t have one look at them.</P>
<P>There is my uncle leading Lady Cornelia with the mo&s;t gallant air ima|ginable. By the motion of her hand and head it would &s;eem that &s;he is di&s;|cu&s;&s;ing &s;ome deep que&s;tion in politics,
<PB N="162" REF="161">
theology, or the belles lettres; and my uncle, by his a&s;enting nods, is fully convinced I ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>But here comes the virgin huntre&s;s, with Mr. Greville on one &s;ide of her, and Mr. Harley on the other. I prote&s;t &s;he does not accompany Lady Cornelia in the carriage, but mounts her &s;teed with mo&s;t ma&s;culine agility, to e&s;cort her female friend. Her military riding|habit, the fierce cock of her hat, the intrepid air of her countenance, make her have the appearance of a very re|&s;pectable guard, Ah! what a pity &s;he has petticoats!&mdash; My uncle looks up to me as he pa&s;&s;es, and beckons me. I come, my dear Sir&mdash;again! Pray do not be impatient. Adieu! then, my dear Euphemia, for a &s;hort time only, for I &s;hall di&s;patch this letter to the po&s;t to-day.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="162">I found the gentlemen entertaining them&s;elves very freely with the &s;ingu|larities of their female vi&s;itants. How ab&s;urd does it &s;eem in our &s;ex to &s;tep out of nature, in order to be more agreeable! And how mortified would the&s;e mi&s;taken candidates for general admiration be, if they could, un&s;een, hear the cen&s;ures and ridicule that are ca&s;t on them, in&s;tead of the prai&s;es they expect.</P>
<P>My uncle congratulated me on hav|ing e&s;caped this di&s;agreeable vi&s;it; how|ever, &s;aid he, your part would only have been &s;ilence; for wherever Lady Cor|nelia is no one talks but her&s;elf.</P>
<P>'Lady Cornelia,' &s;aid Mr. Greville, <Q>does not mix in company to conver&s;e, but to make orations. She will &s;tun her female vi&s;itants of &s;ixteen with learned gibberi&s;h; gives rules for epic and dramatic poetry, and cannot en|dure
<PB N="164" REF="163">
a comedy that is not within the law of four-and-twenty hours.</Q></P>
<P>'Ah! if your charming friend,' pur|&s;ued Mr. Greville, looking at me. (Can you gue&s;s who he meant, my dear?) <Q>had been here, what a contra&s;t might we not have ob&s;erved between true genius and an affectation of knowledge &mdash; elegant language, and pedantic &s;tiffne&s;s, ju&s;t &s;entiment and unintelligible conceit: when the other preached &s;he would only &s;peak; and, as &s;ome one ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, by making plain and &s;imple an&s;wers to her rid|dles, and giving di&s;tinction to her confu&s;ion, &s;he would have done her at lea&s;t the good office of expounding her to her&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>A man makes a &s;illy figure,' &s;aid Mr. Harley, <Q>in company with &s;o learned a Lady, and her Amazonian friend. Talents &s;o ma&s;culine, and &s;o o&s;tenta|tiou&s;ly di&s;played, place them above
<PB N="165" REF="164">
tho&s;e attentions and a&s;&s;iduities to which the charming &s;ex have &s;o ju&s;t a claim, and which we delight to pay. Women &s;hould always be women; the virtues of our &s;ex are not the virtues of theirs. When Lady Cornelia declaims in Greek, and Mi&s;s Sandford vaults into her &s;addle like another Hot&s;pur, I for|get I am in company with women: the dogmatic critic awes me into &s;ilence, and the hardy rider makes my a&s;&s;i&s;tance unnece&s;&s;ary.</Q></P>
<P>'You do well,' &s;aid Mr. Greville, laughing, <Q>to find an excu&s;e for not fly|ing to take up Mi&s;s Sandford's hand|kerchief when &s;he dropped it, nor at|tending to a que&s;tion put to you in Latin by Lady Cornelia.</Q></P>
<P>'Oh! as for that,' replied Mr. Har|ley, <Q>Lady Cornelia an&s;wered her&s;elf, and Mi&s;s Sandford drew up her hand|kerchief with the end of her whip &s;o dexterou&s;ly, that I had no opportunity of &s;erving her.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="165">'I DO not think hunting,' &s;aid my uncle, <Q>a proper &s;port for ladies; it &s;poils their complexion, gives, them ma&s;culine manners, and hardens their tempers. A woman who, like Mi&s;s Sandford, leaps every five-bar gate, is ready to join the hunt&s;man's hollow, and would grieve if &s;he is not in at the death, may make a jolly companion over a fla&s;k of wine, but mu&s;t not ex|pect to in&s;pire a delicate pa&s;&s;ion. I would as &s;oon marry the female pedant, her friend, as one of tho&s;e Amazonian ladies.</Q></P>
<P>'Ah, Sir,' replied Mr. Harley, <Q>if you have &s;een the young, the noble, the beautiful Loui&s;a join the chace, under the conduct of a fond father, and affectionate brothers, you would confe&s;s, that female delicacy may be pre&s;erved even in that habit; and that exerci&s;e, by the elegance and propri|ety of her dre&s;s, &s;he lo&s;es none of the tender graces of her &s;ex and years; her charming face retains all its &s;weetne&s;s,
<PB N="167" REF="166">
her form all its delicacy, and her mind all its native &s;oftne&s;s.The happy in|nocent animal, whom &s;he pur&s;ues but to &s;ave, as if con&s;cious of her gene|rous intention, takes &s;helter at her feet, and there is &s;ure of protection.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You have re&s;cued one of our fair huntre&s;&s;es from Sir John's general cen&s;ure,</Q> &s;aid Mr. Greville. <Q>Do you think we could not find a lady eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed for her erudi|tion, who yet is free from pedantry and o&s;tentation?</Q> <Q>You, Sir, know &s;uch a one, I am &s;ure,</Q> replied Mr. Harley. <Q>The wi&s;e, the pious, the virtuous Eleonora, &s;uperior to mo&s;t of our &s;ex in learning, in gentlene&s;s equal to the mo&s;t gentle of her own. The poets de&s;cribe Mode&s;ty as blu&s;hing at her own motion. Eleonora engages in di&s;cour&s;e with timidity and is &s;ur|pri&s;ed, confu&s;ed, to find her &s;uperio|rity acknowleged by tho&s;e, who&s;e higher attainments &s;he con&s;idered with awe.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="167"><Q>THEN this lady does not &s;tun one with her Latin and Greek like Lady Cornelia,</Q> &s;aid my uncle.</P>
<P>'So far from it. Sir,' replied Mr. Harley, <Q>that unle&s;s her extraordi|nary acquirements are called forth by &s;ome apt and unavoidable occa&s;ion, one may conver&s;e with her for whole years as a &s;en&s;ible and amiable woman, without di&s;covering her to be a great genius.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Harley, this moment, tapped at my door, and pre&s;ented me a &s;mall box, which contained your dear picture, which he would &s;uffer no one to bring up to me but him&s;elf. I could not help thanking him very cordially, for the &s;atisfaction he &s;hewed in doing me this kind office.</P>
<P>After we had &s;pent &s;ome time in ad|miring tho&s;e features, which &s;o power|fully expre&s;s the beauty of the &s;oul that
<PB N="169" REF="168">
animates them. I ordered my woman to tie the ribbon, to which I had fa&s;tened it round my neck; this ta&s;k, al&s;o, he would perform, and did very dexte|rou&s;ly. And now, I would have had him leave me, that I might be at liberty to indulge, alone, the &s;ad, yet plea&s;ing ideas, with which this dear image filled my mind, when, with a look of &s;ympa|thi&s;ing tenderne&s;s and concern, he drew from his pocket your letter.</P>
<P>Oh! my Euphemia, my foreboding heart told me this would be the la&s;t I &s;hould receive from you in England. With trembling ha&s;te I broke the &s;eal.&mdash;Your fir&s;t lines confirmed the melan|choly truth&mdash;I bur&s;t into tears; and vainly repeated to Mr. Harley, my ear|ne&s;t de&s;ire to be left alone. He threw him&s;elf at my feet, and while he held one of my hands, and pre&s;t it to his lips, I felt it wet with a &s;ympathi&s;ing tear.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="169">'Yes,' &s;aid I, <Q>you would love her, as I do, if you knew her; and, like me, you would grieve at being &s;epa|rated from her&mdash; for ever.</Q> He &s;oothed my &s;orrows, by a tender participation in them. He comforted me with hope; and, when he found me a little com|po&s;ed, he told me, that if I had any letters ready, the me&s;&s;enger who brought the picture would procure a &s;afe and &s;peedy conveyance for them, his bro|ther being to &s;et out immediately for London; but that I had not a moment to lo&s;e. Alas! I have a thou&s;and thou|&s;and things to &s;ay to you, and not a moment to &s;ay them. Farewell then, my Euphemia! and to that Almighty Power, to whom &s;uch piety and virtue mu&s;t be dear, I tru&s;t the pre&s;ervation of my friend! Farewell! farewell!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII. MRS. NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS will be the la&s;t letter you will receive from me in England, my dear Maria; and could I not, at the &s;ame time that I tell you this di&s;agree|able news, congratulate you on your approaching union with the virtuous youth who has &s;o well de&s;erved you, my full heart would have found it very difficult to bid you farewell; but I leave you happy, happy as my fonde&s;t wi&s;hes for you could require.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. MRS. NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Port&s;mouth.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR MARIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It was a great comfort to me that I did not mi&s;s your la&s;t packet, which was delivered to me a few hours before I &s;et out from London. It brings me a confirmation of your happine&s;s; and can I then, loving you as I do, be le&s;s than happy, when you are &s;upremely &s;o? Mrs. Bellenden in&s;i&s;ted upon my performing my journey to this place in her coach, though I made a fifth in it; but the three young ladies accommodated them&s;elves very ea&s;ily on the back &s;eat,
<PB N="175" REF="174">
and I was obliged to &s;it next their mo|ther, who&s;e polite attention to me, I am afraid, was not properly repaid by one, who&s;e thoughts were &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by the ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE Colonel and Mr. Neville, with the men-&s;ervants, rode on hor&s;e-back, the maids were di&s;po&s;ed of in the &s;tage|coach, and my worthy Mrs. Ben&s;on and Fanny were together in a po&s;t|chai&s;e. We were ho&s;pitably entertained two nights, at the hou&s;e of a friend of the Colonel's; and next morning Cap|tain Wilmot &s;ent the boat, full manned, to bring the Colonel and his train on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P>AFTER all the ceremonies of our re|ception were over, we retired to our &s;e|veral little apartments. The Colonel and his family are all lodged near each other very commodiou&s;ly. One of the lieu|tenants, an old acquaintance of Mr.
<PB N="176" REF="175">
Neville's, having very obligingly re|&s;igned his cabin to me during the voy|age, I found a &s;mall writing de&s;k in it, which I &s;hall make good u&s;e of. Mrs. Ben&s;on and Fanny continue to be bed|fellows, and are to be very near me.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN Wilmot gave us an elegant dinner, and did the honours of his ta|ble very gracefully. The beautiful Mi&s;s Bellenden drew his particular attention, though her vivacity &s;eemed a little clouded by her regret at leaving Eng|land, or rather, her beloved London, alone, the &s;cene of all her triumphs.</P>
<P>I HAPPENED to be &s;eated at table near a lady, who I found was a relation of the Captain's; &s;he had the air and man|ner of a woman of fa&s;hion, but &s;eemed &s;unk in &s;o profound a melancholy, that, although &s;he an&s;wered with great po|litene&s;s to the u&s;ual civilities that pa&s;s between per&s;ons at the &s;ame table, yet
<PB N="177" REF="176">
&s;he did not engage at all in the conver|&s;ation, but &s;eemed wholly taken up with her own &s;ad thoughts.</P>
<P>I OBSERVED her eyes were continually turned upon a mo&s;t beautiful and ele gant boy, about twelve years of age, who &s;at oppo&s;ite to her, and when &s;he removed them, it was always with a &s;igh, that &s;eemed to rend her heart.</P>
<P>THE boy, whenever he met her eager glance, turned pale and red alternately, while his &s;weet eyes &s;eemed full of tears, which he &s;trove to hide, by for|cing a &s;mile at an au&s;tere looking gentle|man next him, who watched his looks attentively, and never failed to re|pel the ri&s;ing &s;oftne&s;s by a dreadful frown.</P>
<P>WHILE I was bu&s;ied in ob&s;erving their different emotions, which greatly affected me, the lady, who&s;e &s;tifled grief had almo&s;t ri&s;en to a &s;uffocation,
<PB N="178" REF="177">
a&s;ked me, in a voice &s;carcely articulate, for a &s;melling-bottle, I immediately produced one, and propo&s;ed to her to leave the company for a few minutes, and go into fre&s;her air.</P>
<P>SHE accepted my &s;upporting arm; the ladies were now all in motion to a&s;|&s;i&s;t her, as well as the gentlemen; but &s;he begged to be permitted to with|draw for a few minutes with me, on whom &s;he &s;till leaned.</P>
<P>'AYE, aye,' &s;aid the &s;tern gentle|man, whom I found was her hu&s;band, <Q>take a little air, my dear, this will go off.</Q> And nodding &s;ignificantly at Captain Wilmot, <Q>Women will be fooli&s;h,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>there is no help for it.</Q></P>
<P>THE &s;weet boy ro&s;e up eagerly, as if he would have gone with us, but was with|held by the frowning &s;ire; he yielded &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively; but his eyes followed
<PB N="179" REF="178">
us to the door with &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion of tender anxiety, as moved me greatly.</P>
<P>I LED the lady to my little apart|ment, and &s;eated her on the bed. She bur&s;t into a violent pa&s;&s;ion of tears, which &s;eemed a little to relieve her la|bouring heart. I endeavoured to &s;ooth her, and begged of her to tell me, if I could in any way be u&s;eful to her.</P>
<P>'AH! Madam,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>I ought to a&s;k your pardon, for being thus trouble&s;ome to you with my grief; but when you are a mother, you will be able to gue&s;s what my &s;ufferings are this moment.</Q></P>
<Q>I AM upon the point of being &s;e|parated, perhaps for ever, from the darling of my &s;oul. That boy, that lovely boy! you &s;aw at table, he is my &s;on, he is my only child; the mo&s;t dutiful, the mo&s;t affectionate of chil|dren; he will be torn from me this day;
<PB N="180" REF="179">
his father will have it &s;o; I cannot &s;ur|vive this parting&mdash;I wi&s;h not to &s;ur|vive it.</Q>
<P>ANOTHER &s;hower of tears now bur&s;t from her eyes: &s;omebody tapping gently at the door, I opened it, and Captain Wilmot appeared, leading the boy; who &s;eeing the di&s;order his mother was in, &s;prung into her arms; and lean|ing his head over her &s;houlder, while &s;he pre&s;&s;ed him to her &s;obbing bo&s;om, he wept in &s;ilence, anxious, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to hide his tears.</P>
<P>'It is you cou&s;in,' &s;aid the lady, ca&s;t|ing an upbraiding glance at the captain, <Q>it is to you that I am indebted for this &s;evere affliction. Why would you en|courage Mr. Man&s;el in this odious de|&s;ign of &s;ending our &s;on to &s;ea? is he not born to an ea&s;y fortune? was he not pro&s;ecuting his &s;tudies with the greate&s;t application and &s;ucce&s;s?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="180">'MY dear cou&s;in,' interrupted the captain, <Q>you accu&s;e me unju&s;tly; I found Captain Man&s;el determined to bring up his &s;on to the &s;ea-&s;ervice, a &s;ervice in which he him&s;elf has ac|quired reputation. I neither encou|raged nor di&s;&s;uaded him from his re&s;o|lution, but de&s;ired to have him on board my own &s;hip; and will it not be a greater &s;atisfaction to you, that he &s;hould make his fir&s;t voyage under my care and protection, than with a &s;tranger?</Q></P>
<P>The poor little boy now interpo&s;ed; and taking one of his mother's hands, which he ki&s;&s;ed tenderly &s;everal times, &s;aid, in a &s;oothing voice&mdash;<Q>My dear mamma, make your&s;elf ea&s;y, I &s;hall be very happy under my cou&s;in's protection, he will bring me back &s;afe to you; and if upon this trial I &s;hould not like the &s;ea, or be found unfit for it, my papa may be per&s;uaded to alter his mind.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="181">THE weeping mother made no reply; but &s;trained him again in her arms, as if determined never to let him go from thence. The captain and I employed every argument we could think of to con&s;ole and &s;atisfy her mind; without attending to what we &s;aid, &s;he ex|claimed&mdash;</P>
<Q>AH, my child, this boi&s;terous ele|ment may not agree with the delicacy of your con&s;titution. Who now will watch over your health? Who will attend to your complaints?</Q>
<P>'I WILL, Madam,' cried I, eagerly&mdash; <Q>I will &s;upply your place during this voyage; in my cares and a&s;&s;iduity Ma&s;ter Man&s;el &s;hall find another pa|rent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>OH! what comfort do you give me, Madam,</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Man&s;el; <Q>if any thing can &s;upport me under this afflict|ing &s;eparation, it will be this kind
<PB N="183" REF="182">
promi&s;e of yours. Edmund,</Q> &s;aid &s;he to her &s;on, <Q>this &s;weet lady will be your mother now; I need not bid you love and re&s;pect her, for you have a grate|ful heart.</Q> The boy an&s;wered only by a mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive look, and a bow low as the ground.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN Man&s;el now bur&s;t in upon us.</P>
<P><Q>What! have you not done whimper|ing yet?</Q> &s;aid he to his lady. <Q>Come, come, every body has been enquir|ing for you.</Q></P>
<P>HE &s;trutted before her, and Captain Wilmot giving her his hand to lead her to the company, I addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome tri|fling conver&s;ation to Ma&s;ter Man&s;el, in order to begin our acquaintance, and le&s;&s;en his re&s;erve.</P>
<P>WHILE Mrs. Man&s;el was apologizing to the company for her ab&s;ence, I took
<PB N="184" REF="183">
care to &s;eat my&s;elf next to my young charge, as I now con&s;idered him. I talked to him familiarly, and le&s;&s;ened his diffidence in&s;en&s;ibly. He &s;erved me with my tea and coffee with a grace and freedom, and at the &s;ame time with an a&s;&s;iduity, that &s;hewed at once the ele|gance of his manners, and the particular plea&s;ure he took in attending me.</P>
<P>MY heart glowed with tran&s;port when I ob&s;erved that the moth&eacute;r, who watched our behaviour, beheld the growing in|timacy with a &s;atisfaction which &s;eemed to &s;u&s;pend her grief. She took an op|portunity to approach me&mdash;and gra&s;ping my hand with an eager pre&s;&s;ure&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>I SEE my &s;on will be happy in your favours to him,</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q>this good|ne&s;s of your's has pre&s;erved me from de&s;pair. You are all over angel,</Q> pur&s;ued &s;he in a tran&s;ported accent: <Q>you look and act like one; and Hea|ven
<PB N="185" REF="184">
&s;urely &s;ent you to my relief on this trying occa&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>I STOPPED this rhap&s;ody, by calling her attention to the little &s;chemes we had formed for our amu&s;ement during the voyage. I promi&s;ed to make him ac|quainted with the colonel's young daughters; and a&s;&s;ured her he would pa&s;s his time very agreeably in &s;uch &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The evening now approached: I ex|pected &s;he would be &s;oon &s;ummoned to depart. I felt for her &s;o &s;incerely, that I dreaded the fatal moment, and could not help trembling when I &s;aw Captain Wilmot advancing towards us. He &s;eemed di&s;concerted, and unwilling to tell her, that &s;he mu&s;t take leave of her &s;on; but Captain Man&s;el &s;pared him the di&s;agreeable ta&s;k.</P>
<P>'The boat is ready, my dear,' &s;aid he, with an unfeeling abruptne&s;s. <Q>Ed|mund,
<PB N="186" REF="185">
God ble&s;s you! Come, my dear, give him a ki&s;s, we mu&s;t be gone.</Q></P>
<P>A PALENESS, like that of death, over|&s;pread her countenance. She &s;tood mo|tionle&s;s, uttering not a word, nor &s;hed|ing a tear, whil&s;t the boy, who on his knee had received his father's ble&s;&s;ing, now pro&s;trated him&s;elf at her feet; and &s;truggling to &s;uppre&s;s his &s;ighs and tears, while he held her hand, which he eagerly ki&s;&s;ed &s;everal times, uttered in broken accents&mdash;</P>
<Q>WILL you not give me your ble&s;&s;|ing, my dear mamma? Pray look upon me&mdash;do not grieve, I &s;hall &s;oon return to you&mdash;indeed I &s;hall.</Q>
<P>MRS. Man&s;el, whom I had &s;upported all this time, after breathing a deep &s;igh, turned her eyes upon her &s;on, who was &s;till kneeling, and &s;preading her arms, he &s;prung into her embrace, wet|ing
<PB N="187" REF="186">
her bo&s;om with his tears, which now flowed fa&s;t from her eyes al&s;o.</P>
<P>THIS &s;cene affected even the men who were pre&s;ent. Mrs. Bellenden was greatly moved, and the young ladies were drowned in tears.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN Man&s;el's &s;terne&s;s put an end to it. He &s;eized his wife's hand, and told her in a voice, not very tender, that &s;he was to blame to work upon the boy's pa&s;&s;ions, by giving way to her ex|travagant grief.&mdash;'See how he blubbers,' continued he &mdash;<Q>what a milk-&s;op you make of him! Come, I &s;hall lo&s;e all patience if you go on thus.</Q></P>
<P>THE poor lady, who evidently was in great awe of him, &s;uffered her&s;elf to be led upon the deck. I followed her with Ma&s;ter Man&s;el, giving her, as we pa&s;&s;ed on, the mo&s;t tender a&s;&s;urances of my at|tention to him. She &s;eemed &s;truggling to repre&s;s her angui&s;h, and a&s;&s;ume &s;ome
<PB N="188" REF="187">
degree of fortitude; and being now ready to &s;eat her&s;elf in the chair, by which &s;he was to be let down into the boat, after &s;aluting the ladies, and the re&s;t of the company, &s;he took a more cordial leave of me, whi&s;pering, <Q>Re|member what you have promi&s;ed me.</Q> Then &s;olding her &s;on once more in her arms, &s;he breathed an ardent ble&s;|&s;ing on him, and &s;till pre&s;erved &s;ome compo&s;ure, till &s;he was got into the boat. I then &s;aw her &s;uddenly &s;ink into her hu&s;band's arms, apparently in a fainting fit.</P>
<P>HER &s;on, who had kept his eyes fixed upon her, cried out to me in a mourn|ful voice, 'Ah! Madam, my mother!' and hiding his face to conceal his tears. I endeavoured to comfort him, but in vain; till perceiving &s;he was recovered, I bid him look up, and &s;hewed him his tender mother, now &s;tanding waving her handkerchief to him&mdash;which he returned
<PB N="189" REF="188">
with repeated bows, till the boat was out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>WE are got under &s;ail; all the ladies, except Mrs. Bellenden and my&s;elf, are &s;ea-&s;ick. My dear Mrs. Ben&s;on &s;trug|gled with the &s;ame di&s;order for &s;ome hours, in order to keep me company; but &s;he was at la&s;t forced to yield to it; and &s;he, as well as Fanny, is confined to her bed.</P>
<P>I SAT upon the quarter-deck, as it is called, more than two hours this morn|ing, under an awning, which Lieutenant Crawford, my hu&s;band's friend, cau&s;ed to be &s;et up for me, with no other com|pany than my young charge, who never leaves me but when he retires to his &s;tudies, under the direction of the cap|tain; as for Mr. Neville, he always finds mo&s;t amu&s;ement where I am not. My eyes follow the receding &s;hores, while I revolve a thou&s;and tender melancholy ideas, and many a heavy &s;igh I breathed,

My mind feels its awful influence&mdash; my ideas are all &s;olemn and &s;ad.

<P>TO-DAY Mrs. Bellenden and I, ac|companied by the colonel, took an air|ing upon deck.

I embraced, and
<PB N="192" REF="191">
congratulated both her and my&s;elf for this change: but as the good things of this life are often mixed with the bad, I found Ma&s;ter Man&s;el wor&s;e, and even with &s;ome &s;ymptoms of a fe|ver. I &s;taid with him great part of the day; and in the afternoon Mrs. Ben&s;on and I went to vi&s;it our &s;ick friends. Mrs. Bellenden we found bu&s;y in nur&s;ing her daughters; for all their female attend|ants were &s;o &s;ick, that &s;he could have but little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from them. Mi&s;s Bellenden, wrapped in a white &s;atin negligee, with a mo&s;t becoming night|dre&s;s on her head, lay reclined on &s;ome cu&s;hions, moaning grievou&s;ly. Our young naval commander had, I found, been extremely a&s;&s;iduous about her, never failing to enquire a dozen times in a day concerning her health; and when his vi&s;its were permitted, expre&s;&s;ed great &s;olicitude for her. But this &s;ingle adorer could not comfort her for the gay &s;cenes &s;he had abandoned; and the general admiration &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had
<PB N="193" REF="192">
attracted, when in the mid&s;t of them, &s;he &s;uffered more from di&s;content than &s;ickne&s;s&mdash;&s;he is &s;ullen, fretful, and im|patient.</P>
<P>WHEN I came into their apartment, I found her mother gently reproving her for her behaviour, which, &s;he &s;aid, greatly affected her father, who is very fond of her.</P>
<P>'HE thinks it &s;trange, my dear,' &s;aid Mrs. Bellenden, <Q>that you &s;hould &s;hew &s;o much reluctance to follow him to any place where his duty calls him: this peevi&s;hne&s;s alters you &s;o, that one would hardly know you.</Q></P>
<P>'ALTERS me, Madam!' repeated Mi&s;s Bellenden, rou&s;ed to attention by the&s;e intere&s;ting words.</P>
<P>'YES, my dear,' replied Mrs. Bel|lenden, <Q>I appeal to Mrs. Neville for the ju&s;tne&s;s of my ob&s;ervation.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="193"><Q>PRAY be free, my dear Mrs. Ne|ville,</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Bellenden, eagerly, <Q>Tell me, am I really altered?</Q></P>
<P>'MY dear Mi&s;s,' &s;aid I, <Q>I am &s;orry to be obliged to tell you &s;o di&s;agree|able a truth; but if you &s;uffer this depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits to gain upon you, it may produce the jaundice, a di&s;|temper which is often the effect of con|tinued di&s;content.</Q></P>
<P>'OH Heavens!' cried Mi&s;s Bellen|den, taking out her pocket-gla&s;s, and fixing her eyes upon it, <Q>how you terrify me!</Q></P>
<P>COLONEL Bellenden and Captain Wil|mot that moment entered; the latter ob&s;erving the young lady &s;o intently gazing upon her own image that &s;he did not perceive him, went clo&s;e up to her, and whi&s;pered her to beware of the fate of Narci&s;&s;us.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="194">'HAD Narci&s;&s;us the jaundice, then?' &s;aid &s;he, turning to him.</P>
<P>'THE jaundice!' repeated the cap|tain, &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>'AYE,' &s;aid Mi&s;s Bellenden; <Q>here is Mrs. Neville and my mamma have been frightening me out of my wits; they tell me I am grown quite &s;hock|ing with this &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s; I &s;hall hate the &s;ea while I live; I wi&s;h we could have gone to this New-York by land.</Q></P>
<P>'I AM glad that was not po&s;&s;ible,' &s;aid Captain Wilmor, half &s;miling, <Q>for then I &s;hould not have had the plea|&s;ure of conducting you.</Q></P>
<P>I HEARD no more of the &s;prightly dialogue that en&s;ued, being engaged in di&s;cour&s;e with the colonel and his lady, and in paying my compliments to the two younge&s;t ladies, who are as ill as
<PB N="196" REF="195">
their &s;i&s;ter, but not quite &s;o impatient. Pre&s;ently afterwards Mrs. Ben&s;on and I took leave of them.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;he left me to retire for the night, I had recour&s;e to my pen. It is a great comfort to me to be this way with you, and that from time to time I can make you read, that your image is the dear companion of all my &s;oli|tary hours.</P>
<P>WHEN I vi&s;ited Ma&s;ter Man&s;el this morning, I was greatly alarmed to find his fever very high: Captain Wilmot ordered the &s;urgeon to attend him im|mediately. This gentleman, who is a grave, &s;en&s;ible man, and, as far as I can judge, very &s;kilful, thinks his di&s;|temper will be the &s;mall-pox. Mrs. Man&s;el, it &s;eems, never had courage enough to have him inoculated: un|happy, yet amiable weakne&s;s, in a mind &s;o full of maternal tenderne&s;s!</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="196">I AM now fixed by his bed-&s;ide: I give him all his medicines, he refu&s;es nothing from my hand. At times he is deli|rious, and then he takes me for his mo|ther. Giving me that tender appellation, which he accompanies with &s;uch affec|tionate expre&s;&s;ions of duty and obedi|ence, as go to my heart. My anxiety is inexpre&s;&s;ible! I fear for him, I fear for his mother&mdash;I fear for my&s;elf, for I feel a mother's tenderne&s;s for him.</P>
<P>THE &s;urgeon tells me, the &s;ymptoms are all favourable. He approves my method of nur&s;ing him; but I have &s;ome conte&s;ts to &s;u&s;tain with Mr. Ne|ville, who is prejudiced in favour of all the old methods; he is indeed di&s;ea&s;ed with opinion, and infected by cu&s;tom. He &s;ays I &s;tarve the youth; and, al|though the weather is very warm, mut|ters &s;adly when I &s;uffer the fre&s;h air to enter the little cabin. He a&s;ks me, <Q>How I will an&s;wer it to Mrs. Man&s;el if I kill her &s;on by my improper ma|nagement?<PB N="198" REF="197"></Q>
I generally get off by referring him to the &s;urgeon, who&s;e di|rections I tell him I am re&s;olved to fol|low. He retires, &s;hrugging up his &s;houlders; and I, in this ca&s;e, per&s;i&s;t in my own way.</P>
<P>I HAVE pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome days under the mo&s;t unea&s;y &s;olicitude; but now, thank Heaven! all goes well: the eruption is &s;o favourable, that the &s;urgeon a&s;&s;ures me we have nothing to fear. But the dear boy's &s;en&s;ibility is &s;o great, that he even oppre&s;&s;es me with the exce&s;s of his gratitude. He employs the warme&s;t acknowledgments, the mo&s;t endearing expre&s;&s;ions, to te&s;tify the &s;en&s;e he has of what he calls my kindne&s;s to him. I am obliged to leave him &s;ometimes for half an hour together, to put a &s;top to the&s;e &s;trong effu&s;ions of his grateful heart, le&s;t they &s;hould act too power|fully upon his &s;pirits.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="198">I HAVE the plea&s;ure to tell you, my dear Maria, that notwith&s;tanding all Mr. Neville's fatal progno&s;tications, at which I own I have been weak enough to be &s;ometimes alarmed, that my young friend is perfectly recovered, and will lo&s;e nothing of his beauty. The little redne&s;s that remains on his face will, the &s;urgeon a&s;&s;ures me, leave no marks. The Bellenden family, and Captain Wilmot in particular, have con|gratulated me upon this event in the mo&s;t obliging terms.</P>
<P>Mr. Neville, however, per&s;i&s;ts in ar|raigning my &s;kill as a nur&s;e; calls Ma&s;|ter Man&s;el's recovery a lucky hit, in which the odds were ten to one again&s;t him; and declares, when he is &s;o happy as to be a father, he will treat this di&s;|temper, when his child has it, his own way.</P>
<P><Q>HEAVEN forbid you &s;hould have a daughter then,</Q> cried Mi&s;s Bellenden;
<Q><PB N="200" REF="199">
&s;ure you do not intend to &s;poil her face! Why, what a cruel man are you?</Q></P>
<P>'Your mamma was more cruel,' &s;aid Captain Wilmot to her, in a low voice, for he always contrives to &s;it next her, <Q>when &s;he prevented what you think &s;uch a misfortune; &s;he may be called the fir&s;t cau&s;e of all the murders you have committed.</Q></P>
<P>MISS Bellenden &s;miled graciou&s;ly at this gro&s;s flattery, which encouraged the gallant captain to add:</P>
<Q>CONFESS, now, have you the lea&s;t remor&s;e at being able to kill your thou&s;and in a day?</Q>
<P>CLARA, the lively Clara, that moment rai&s;ing her eyes from a book which &s;he had been reading, and ca&s;ting them archly on her &s;i&s;ter, repeated, <HI>What! a whole day, and kill but one poor thou&s;and!</HI>
<PB N="201" REF="200">
The powerful expre&s;&s;ion of her look and voice charmed me, and rivetted the cap|tain's attention upon her for a minute, which Mi&s;s Bellenden ob&s;erving, &s;aid peevi&s;hly,
<Q>I SUPPOSE, Mi&s;s, you found that piece of wit in your book there.</Q></P>
<P>'INDEED I did,' &s;aid Clara; <Q>here, you may read it if you plea&s;e,</Q> and offered her the book, which Mi&s;s Bel|lenden rejecting with a contemptuous frown, the &s;weet girl gave it to me; 'See, Mrs. Neville,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>how truly my &s;i&s;ter has gue&s;&s;ed; and gue&s;s|work it mu&s;t always be with my &s;i&s;ter,</Q> whi&s;pered &s;he to me, <Q>for &s;he hates reading, and always joins with my mamma when &s;he chides me for being fond of it.</Q></P>
<P>CAPTAIN W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lmot now ha&s;tily &s;tepped up to me; and looking over my &s;houl|der,
<PB N="202" REF="201">
as I held the book open in my hand:</P>
<P>'AH!' &s;aid he, <Q>it is Dryden's tra|gedy of the Duke of Gui&s;e, and Mar|montier&mdash;the charming Marmontier &s;peaks that &s;prightly line.</Q></P>
<P>HE begged me to give him the book; and re&s;uming his &s;eat near Mi&s;s Bellen|den, read out the &s;cene, which is full of extravagant pa&s;&s;ion, all which he ap|plied to the fair coquet with too little ceremony I thought; but &s;he &s;eemed highly delighted, though he read &s;o ill, that Clara could not hide her di&s;&s;a|tisfaction, but murmured &s;oftly, <Q>Poor Dryden, you have got into bad hands, I perceive.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN the Colonel joined us, the con|ver&s;ation took another turn; for cap|tain Wilmot is extremely re&s;erved in his addre&s;s to Mi&s;s Bellenden before her worthy father; however, as this gentle|man's
<PB N="203" REF="202">
private fortune is very con&s;ider|able, his pre&s;ent &s;tation re&s;pectable, and his intere&s;t great, he certainly would be no bad match for the young lady; but a coquet generally u&s;es her advantages &s;o ill, that the&s;e &s;udden attachments &s;el|dom produce any &s;erious con&s;equences.</P>
<P>THE winds &s;eem to favour the pa&s;&s;ion of our gallant commander; and, in order to keep the charming object near him, have lulled them&s;elves into &s;o per|fect a calm, that we make, in the &s;ailor's phra&s;e, very little way, and our voyage is likely to la&s;t long: however, as our &s;ick are now in a fair way of being well, we pa&s;s our time very agreeably. We have mu&s;ic often, cards &s;ometimes, and fea&s;ting every day.</P>
<P>COLONEL Bellenden and the captain keep &s;plendid tables: we have con&s;tant invitations to both; but I am never hap|pier than when I am permitted to pa&s;s a day in private with my own family, in
<PB N="204" REF="203">
the plea&s;ing vici&s;&s;itude of conver&s;ation, reading, work, and writing to you.</P>
<P>POOR Mi&s;s Bellenden is in a &s;tate of mortification at pre&s;ent. Notwith&s;tand|ing the gratification her vanity has met with in the &s;ighs of the enamoured Captain Wilmot, &s;he has always pined in &s;ecret after the fuller triumphs &s;he enjoyed in the gay metropolis, where &s;he was a general toa&s;t. The unea&s;ine&s;s of her mind has brought on hy&s;teric fits, to which it &s;eems &s;he is &s;ubject.</P>
<P>HITHER TO &s;he has been a very charm|ing invalid; and both her languor and her de&s;habille have been alike becom|ing: and being well aware of this cir|cum&s;tance, her adorer has not been kept at a di&s;tance on account of her indi&s;po|&s;ition, which only rendered her charms more intere&s;ting: but it is quite another thing with an hy&s;teric fit.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="204">CAPTAIN Wilmot happened to be pre&s;ent ye&s;terday when &s;he was &s;ud|denly &s;eized with one, which proved to be very violent; her frantic &s;creams, the di&s;tortions of her countenance, her &s;truggles, in which &s;he exerted &s;uch &s;trength, that it was with difficulty her mother, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by two maids and my|&s;elf, could hold her. Her lover &s;tood motionle&s;s for &s;ome minutes with amaze|ment; and &s;trong marks of di&s;gu&s;t, mixed with &s;ome tran&s;ient gleams of pity, appeared in his countenance. He ha&s;tened to &s;end the &s;urgeon, and in the mean time the young lady recovered her &s;en&s;es. I left her after &s;he had taken &s;ome drops, and meeting Cap|tain Wilmot, as I was returning to my own apartment, he led me to the door of it, enquiring with more curio&s;ity, as I thought, than concern after the &s;ick lady; I told him &s;he was in no danger; he &s;miled, but in a grave accent &s;aid, it was a terrible malady, he had never &s;een any thing like it.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="205">WE have, for this week pa&s;t, had, what the &s;ailors call, a bri&s;k wind, and that &s;o favourable, that the Captain tells us we may &s;oon expect to reach our de&s;ired port. The weather is now very warm, and a few days ago it was &s;o in|ten&s;ely cold, that we were &s;carce able to endure its rigour; this effect was pro|duced, it &s;eems, by our pa&s;&s;ing near an i&s;land of ice, which ro&s;e up in the mid&s;t of the ocean to a &s;urpri&s;ing height, exactly in the form of a &s;ugar-loaf, which it re&s;embled in colour as well as &s;hape.</P>
<P>I WENT upon deck with the re&s;t of the ladies to take a view of it, but was not able to &s;tay more than a few moments; my limbs &s;eemed all benumbed with cold, and my teeth, as the phra&s;e is, chat|tered in my head. Happily this incon|venience did not la&s;t long; we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of this beautiful, but uncomfort|able object, and its freezing influence was no longer felt.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="206">PROVIDENCE has been plea&s;ed to grant us hitherto &s;o favourable a navi|gation, that nothing has happened to act, even upon the fears of ignorance and inexperience like mine, except a a few &s;qualls, as the &s;ailors call a &s;udden gu&s;t of wind. The hurry and bu&s;tle the&s;e would occa&s;ion among the mari|ners, &s;eemed to me a certain indication that we were going to the bottom; but the danger, as well as the apprehen&s;ion, was &s;oon over.</P>
<P>THE &s;ailors are now emulou&s;ly climbing up to the top-ma&s;t head, as they call it, looking out for land; from this fearful height they &s;eem no big|ger than crows. Happy will the man be who fir&s;t di&s;covers it; he will be pre|&s;ented with a hand&s;ome pur&s;e, the joint offering of all the pa&s;&s;engers. We are all full of plea&s;ing anxious expectation.</P>
<P>IN this interval of hope and &s;u&s;pence, I often amu&s;e my&s;elf with ob&s;erving
<PB N="208" REF="207">
what pa&s;&s;es between the Captain and Mi&s;s Bellenden; the lover&mdash;lover now no more &s;ince the adventure of the hy&s;|teric fit, is become a much more agree|able companion, now that his attention is not wholly engaged by one object&mdash; the lady's malady has re&s;tored him to health; he conver&s;es freely, and, in ge|neral, his eyes are no longer rivetted upon one face; he is at lei&s;ure to attend to all the little complai&s;ances and a&s;&s;idui|ties, which a polite man pays to every female in company, but which a lover confines to one.</P>
<P>HE di&s;gui&s;es his indifference, how|ever, under a mo&s;t profound re&s;pect; Mi&s;s Bellenden &s;eems amazed, con|founded; &s;he calls forth all her attrac|tions; &s;he varies her po&s;ture twenty times in a minute in vain, his attention is wholly di&s;engaged; &s;he grows peevi&s;h, complains of the length of the voyage, enquires impatiently when it will be at an end? The Captain tells her, he
<PB N="209" REF="208">
hopes &s;oon to have the plea&s;ure of con|gratulating her upon the fight of land. &mdash;She &s;tares&mdash;He enters into &s;ome indif|ferent di&s;cour&s;e with Mrs. Bellenden or my&s;elf. She is now down-right angry, and frowns; he does not perceive it; but, in the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation, addre&s;&s;es her with the &s;ame free unem|barra&s;&s;ed air as any other per&s;on in the company, and when &s;he &s;ullenly ne|glects to an&s;wer any que&s;tion he hap|pens to a&s;k her, he &s;hews not the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, but repeats it. with all the ap|parent &s;implicity imaginable, till &s;he thinks fit to an&s;wer him.</P>
<P>HER coquetry is now at a &s;tand; &s;miles and frowns, peevi&s;hne&s;s and good humour, produce no alteration in his countenance and behaviour; he is al|ways polite, always re&s;pectful, and al|ways indifferent.</P>
<P>IT is common with per&s;ons of deeper thinking than Mi&s;s Bellenden, to change
<PB N="210" REF="209">
their opinions of others by their kind|ne&s;s or unkindne&s;s to them. This young lady has now found out, that Captain Wilmot is a very &s;illy fellow, rude, unpoli&s;hed, in a word, a mere &s;ailor, and is much mortified to find, none of us can be per&s;uaded to think as &s;he does. However, &s;he conde&s;cended ye&s;terday to throw out, what &s;he thought, a lure for him; which produced an effect quite contrary from what &s;he expected, and which, to &s;ome of us who knew the &s;ecret, was a very diverting one.</P>
<P>THE young ladies and my&s;elf were to|gether in the gallery, admiring the mo&s;t beautiful land&s;cape imaginable, formed by the &s;etting &s;un, when Captain Wil|mot joined us. He had &s;carce paid his compliments, when we were alarmed with a cry, that one of the &s;ailors had fallen over board; though this bad news was immediately contradicted, yet it had &s;uch an effect upon the tender nerves of Mi&s;s Bellenden, that &s;he &s;ighed out,
<PB N="211" REF="210">
'OH! I &s;hall faint!' and would actually have fallen, if I had not &s;upported her; for the Captain, who was &s;till nearer her, being apprehen&s;ive that &s;he was going to have another hy&s;teric fit, in&s;tead of receiving her in his arms, ran away as fa&s;t as he could to &s;end the Doctor; and we could hear him calling aloud for him long after the lady was recovered. Mi&s;s Bellenden looked mortified to the la&s;t degree, and retired, led by her two &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>I MET the Captain &s;ome time after|wards, and rallied him a little upon his want of gallantry. He a&s;&s;ured me, he had not fortitude enough to bear the &s;ight of a lady in an hy&s;teric fit, and he thought the be&s;t thing he could do, was to &s;end the Doctor to her a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.</P>
<P>IF this young lady could be con|vinced, that the&s;e fits, to which &s;he is &s;o &s;ubject, prove a powerful antidote
<PB N="212" REF="211">
again&s;t the effects of her charms, &s;he might po&s;&s;ibly endeavour to re&s;train the violence of her temper, for it is to that, and not to the weakne&s;s of her con&s;titu|tion, that &s;he owes this di&s;gu&s;ting ma|lady.</P>
<P>I WAS ju&s;t ri&s;en this morning, when the &s;ound of <HI>land! land!</HI> reached my ears, and which was &s;oon afterwards re|peated by a hundred voices at once. A good we ardently wi&s;h for, always ap|pears uncertain till we are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. This may be an illu&s;ion, thought I, a mi&s;take ari&s;ing from too great eager|ne&s;s for the promi&s;ed reward; but I was &s;carce dre&s;&s;ed, when the good news was confirmed to me by Ma&s;ter Man&s;el, who, with a countenance like an April day, half &s;miles, half tears, came to wi&s;h me joy that our voyage would &s;oon be happily concluded.</P>
<P>'METHINKS, my dear little friend,' &s;aid I, <Q>your &s;atisfaction on this occa|&s;ion,
<PB N="213" REF="212">
is not altogether unmixed with &s;ome chagrin; what is the rea&s;on?</Q></P>
<P>'BECAUSE, Madam,' replied he, <Q>I &s;hall &s;oon lo&s;e you; you will forget me I fear, and this parting will be al|mo&s;t as terrible to me as the &s;epara|tion from my mother; for have you not been a mother to me? pur&s;ued he, re&s;pectfully ki&s;&s;ing my hand, which I felt wet with his tears, 'and can I help loving you like a &s;on?</Q></P>
<P>I COMFORTED him with a&s;&s;urances, that I would always love him tenderly, and that while Captain Wilmot re|mained on the coa&s;t, I would make fre|quent opportunities of &s;eeing him.</P>
<P>I NOW went to pay my compliments to the Colonel and his family. Mr. Ne|ville, who, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, is very exact in his ob&s;ervance of all due re&s;pect to his commander, was already in his apartment, which was &s;oon filled

The Captain, without taking notice of an expre&s;&s;ion, that in&s;inuated &s;o great a di&s;like to her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, appeared to en|joy the univer&s;al &s;atisfaction. He gave us an elegant entertainment, at which the mortified fair &s;at &s;ullen and &s;ilent. He a&s;&s;ures us, we &s;hall make the harbour in two days.</P>
<P>THE wi&s;hed for port is now in &s;ight; we are all bu&s;y in making preparations for our landing. Mi&s;s Bellenden and her maid have been in clo&s;e con&s;ult for many hours. The article of dre&s;s, on this occa&s;ion, is an arduous affair with this young lady.</P>
<P>WE are entering fa&s;t the harbour.&mdash;I have now a &s;ight of this new world; my heart throbs with &s;en&s;ations unfelt
<PB N="215" REF="214">
before&mdash;I dread, I hope, I wi&s;h I know not what&mdash;my thoughts are all confu&s;ed. I know not whether to re|joice or weep; but I feel a di&s;po&s;ition to do both.</P>
<P>I AM rou&s;ed from this revery by the noi&s;e of the cannon from the fort. The city of New-York &s;eems to ri&s;e from the waves, and, viewed from the &s;ea, makes a fine appearance. The noi&s;e of the &s;alutes, given and received from all the &s;hips in the harbour, as well as the citadel, &s;tuns me. We have now ca&s;t anchor. I mu&s;t lay down my pen. Mr. Neville tells me the ladies expect me.&mdash;The barge is ordered. My next letter will be dated from the city now in my view.</P>
<P>New-York.</P>
<P>TILL this moment, my dear Maria, I have not had lea&s;ure to re&s;ume my lit|tle
<PB N="216" REF="215">
narrative, though I have been al|ready two days upon this i&s;land.</P>
<P>WHEN I waited upon Mrs. Bellenden in the great cabin, I found the ladies all ready to embark in the &s;hip's barge, which was full manned; the &s;treamers flying, and every decoration, both for &s;tate and convenience, ordered by the Captain, to accommodate Colonel Bel|lenden and his family.</P>
<P>WHEN Mi&s;s Bellenden came upon deck, in the full blaze of dre&s;s and beauty, I ob&s;erved Captain Wilmot look at her attentively, not without &s;ome emotions of &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure, as I thought; but they were &s;oon checked by the &s;illy con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s &s;he betrayed of her own charms, and the &s;cornful, yet exulting glances, &s;he ca&s;t upon him. And he now, having taken a polite leave of Mrs. Bellenden, ad|dre&s;&s;ed her with the mo&s;t perfect indif|ference, a&s;&s;ociating my&s;elf and the young
<PB N="217" REF="216">
ladies, her &s;i&s;ters, in his parting com|pliments.</P>
<P>WHEN we were all &s;eated in the barge, with Mrs. Bellenden at our head, I ob&s;erved to her &s;miling, that &s;he had a numerous &s;uite; and indeed her charm|ing daughters, Mrs. Ben&s;on, my&s;elf, Fanny, with the female &s;ervants, who were all well dre&s;t, formed a re&s;pectable train.</P>
<P>THE Governor's coaches waited our landing; the Colonel put me into the fir&s;t coach with his lady and daughters; Mrs. Bellenden would have it &s;o; he went in the next him&s;elf, with Mrs. Ben&s;on, Mr. Neville, and Fanny; who mode&s;tly declined the honour; but the Colonel in&s;i&s;ted upon taking her.</P>
<P>WE were carried to a very large hou&s;e, the principal tavern in the place, where a magnificent dinner was pro|vided. Here we found a gentleman
<PB N="218" REF="217">
waiting our arrival, who complimented the Colonel from the Governor, and in|troduced &s;ome ladies, wives to &s;ome of the principal merchants, one of whom did the honours of the table very po|litely.</P>
<P>THE Governor had cau&s;ed Colonel Bellenden to be informed, that he would wait upon him in the evening; but the Colonel, ever &s;trictly attentive to all the duties of his &s;tation, with great polite|ne&s;s prevented this vi&s;it, which was in|tended as a mark of high re&s;pect, and paid a vi&s;it him&s;elf to the Governor af|ter dinner, taking Mr. Neville along with him. In the evening, we went to the &s;everal lodgings provided for us in the town, and had rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with their neatne&s;s and convenience.</P>
<P>THIS city is &s;ituated upon an i&s;land about fourteen miles long, but not more than two broad. This i&s;land is ju&s;t in the mouth of the river Hud&s;on,
<PB N="219" REF="218">
one of the noble&s;t rivers in America, and is navigable for more than two hundred miles. Albany, the next prin|cipal city of the province, is &s;ituated on the &s;ame river, at about a hundred and fifty miles di&s;tant from New-York. There Colonel Bellenden, being &s;econd in military command to the Governor, will generally re&s;ide; half of the troops being con&s;tantly quartered there; and there al&s;o we mu&s;t &s;ettle, my hu&s;band being one of the Colonel's lieutenants.</P>
<P>MRS. Bellenden received a vi&s;it to|day from the Governor's lady; &s;he brought with her three of her daughters, all hand&s;ome, their manners ea&s;y and engaging&mdash;&s;o ea&s;y, that after the fir&s;t ceremonies were over, they entered into the mo&s;t familiar conver&s;ation with the Colonel's daughters; and before they parted, made them a thou&s;and profe&s;|&s;ions of friend&s;hip, with &s;urpri&s;ing cor|diality, which cea&s;ed to be &s;urpri&s;ing, when I found the&s;e &s;uddenly formed at|tachments
<PB N="220" REF="219">
is the cu&s;tom of the place. When Mrs. Bellenden pre&s;ented me to the Governor's lady, &s;he in a very grace|ful manner ju&s;t mentioned my family, in order to procure me a more di&s;tin|gui&s;hed notice; and it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged, that Mrs. Montague an&s;wered her intention perfectly well by the recep|tion &s;he gave me.</P>
<P>YESTERDAY we dined at the Gover|nor's, and were mo&s;t &s;plendidly enter|tained. He re&s;ides in a very &s;pacious hou&s;e within the fort, where a lieute|nant's guard mounts every day. It be|ing Sunday, we heard divine &s;ervice in the Governor's chapel. It is &s;mall but elegant; the Governor and his family &s;it in a little covered gallery, decorated with velvet hangings and cu&s;hions; they enter it by a door from one of their own apartments. The principal officers and their wives, who are con&s;idered as the nobility of the place, the Secretary of the Province, and &s;ome other per|&s;ons
<PB N="221" REF="220">
in civil employments, have pews in this chapel, and are always invited to the Governor's table, who is very ho&s;pitable, very polite, and, without de&s;cending from his dignity, extremely affable. He has the reputation of being a man of di&s;tingui&s;hed under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>A SUCCESSION of vi&s;its, balls, and entertainments, for the&s;e ten days pa&s;t, have fatigued me greatly, which, toge|ther with the heat of the climate, at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, brought on a little fever, for which Mrs. Montague pre&s;cribes change of air, and in&s;i&s;ts upon my pa&s;&s;ing a week at a little cottage of her's, as &s;he calls it, about two miles from the city, where &s;he promi&s;es to join me in a day or two; I &s;hall &s;et out accompanied only by Mrs. Ben&s;on and Fanny.</P>
<P>MR. Neville is perpetually engaged; and pleads in excu&s;e for his not attend|ing me in this little excur&s;ion, the im|portunities
<PB N="222" REF="221">
of the numerous friends he has made &s;ince his arrival here, who will not &s;uffer him to have an hour at his own di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>MRS. Ben&s;on tells him, that it is a great misfortune to be &s;o much be|loved, for that one of whom &s;o many others have need, can be of little u&s;e to him&s;elf. 'For my own part,' added &s;he, <Q>I think it better to be le&s;s agree|able; and, as &s;omebody &s;ays, never to &s;acrifice to the graces at all, than to become the victim of the &s;acrifice.</Q></P>
<P>MR. Neville looked a little grave at fir&s;t, not knowing whether to take what &s;he &s;aid as a compliment or banter; but &s;elf-love explained it to his own advan|tage, and the cloud that was gathering on his brow &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>A RIDE of about half an hour brought me to Mrs. Montague's little villa; a cottage for its &s;implicity; but it is a
<PB N="223" REF="222">
palace for elegance and convenience.&mdash;The &s;cene is &s;weetly romantic. I &s;eem already to inhale health and &s;pirits from the balmy breeze, impregnated with a thou&s;and &s;weets from the flowers, which in va&s;t profu&s;ion bloom around me. How &s;weet is &s;olitude, to a mind capable of reli&s;hing its calm and rational plea|&s;ures! Yet it is true, that your ab|&s;ence is a perpetual drawback upon every thing that gives me joy; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing you but in idea, it requires a very &s;trong imagination to make me de|&s;ire nothing more.</P>
<P>MR. Neville favoured me with a vi&s;it this morning, to tell me that a &s;hip will &s;ail to-morrow for England, and that I mu&s;t make up my packet, which he will take care to put into proper hands, that it may be &s;afely delivered. I have been &s;o &s;hort a time here, that I can &s;ay but little of the place and its inhabitants. The city of New-York, as I ob&s;erved
<PB N="224" REF="223">
before, makes a good appearance, viewed from the &s;ea; but its &s;treets are irregular.&mdash;The hou&s;es are of brick, and &s;ome of them built in the Dutch ta&s;te, who were the fir&s;t &s;ettlers; and many of their de&s;cendants remain here. The town has a flouri&s;hing trade, which pro|duces great profits. The merchants are wealthy; and the people, in general, comfortably provided for, and that with very moderate labour. There &s;eems to be great freedom of &s;ociety among the better &s;ort, who are rich and ho&s;pitable. The officers live in a &s;tile &s;uitable to the di&s;tingui&s;hed rank they hold here.&mdash;And the Governor, though ea&s;y of acce&s;s, and very affable in his manners, keeps up a proper &s;tate and dignity.</P>
<P>THE &s;oil of this country, I am told, is extremely fruitful, abounding not only in its native grain, Indian corn, but in all &s;uch as have been naturalized here from Europe. Here is wheat, they
<PB N="225" REF="224">
&s;ay, in &s;uch abundance, and &s;o excel|lent, that few parts of the world, for the part that is cultivated, exceed it in either of the&s;e qualities; nor in barley, oats, rye, and every &s;ort of grain which you have. They have here a great number of horned cattle. Hor&s;es, &s;heep, hogs&mdash;all the European poultry, abound here. Game of all kinds is ex|tremely plenty.&mdash;Wild turkies of a va&s;t &s;ize, and equal goodne&s;s; and a beau|tiful &s;pecies of phea&s;ants, only found, they &s;ay, in this country. Every &s;pe|cies of herbs, or roots, which you force in your gardens, grows here with great ca&s;e, as well as every kind of fruit; but &s;ome, &s;uch as peaches and melons, in far greater perfection than you have them.</P>
<P>FROM the account I have given you, my dear Maria, of the productions of this clime, you will readily agree, that an epicure may find &s;ufficient gratifi|cations
<PB N="226" REF="225">
here for his predominant pa&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>MR. Neville bids me ha&s;te and con|clude. He is going back to town im|mediately, and only waits for my packet. I inclo&s;e a few lines for my Lord L. which I intru&s;t to your care; he is the only per&s;on, among my relations, who, I believe, is anxious to hear from me.</P>
<P>THIS letter will, perhaps, reach your hands in three weeks, if the wind is fa|vourable, and the &s;hip not becalmed, as ours was; and, perhaps, one from you is upon its road to me.&mdash;Oh! that thought, how I enjoy it! I am charged with a thou&s;and compliments to you from Mrs. Ben&s;on and Mr. Ne|ville. Your Fanny is well and happy, and tells you &s;o her&s;elf, in a letter which I inclo&s;e. Say every thing that is re|&s;pectful
<PB N="227" REF="226">
and kind, in my name, to Sir John and Mr. Harley. And from your own heart, my deare&s;t friend, judge of the unalterable affection of your</P>
