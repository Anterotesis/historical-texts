<HEAD>The HISTORY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HESTER WILMOT was born in the pari&s;h of We&s;ton, of parents who maintained them|&s;elves by their labour, they were both of them un|godly, it is no wonder therefore they were un|happy. They lived badly together, and how could they do otherwi&s;e, for their tempers were very different, and they had no religion to &s;mooth down this difference, or to teach them that they ought to bear with each others faults. Rebecca Wilmot was a proof that people may have &s;ome right qualities, and yet be but bad characters. She was clean, notable, and indu&s;trious. Now I know &s;ome folks fancy that the poor who have the&s;e qualities need have no other, but this is a &s;ad mi&s;take, as I am &s;ure every page in the Bible would &s;hew; and it is a pity people do not con&s;ult it oftener. Rebecca was of a violent ungovernable temper; and that very neat|ne&s;s which is in it&s;elf &s;o plea&s;ing, in her became a &s;in, for her affection to her hu&s;band and children was quite lo&s;t in an over-anxious de&s;ire to have her hou&s;e reckoned the nice&s;t in the pari&s;h. Rebecca was al&s;o a proof that a poor woman may be as vain as a rich one, for it was not &s;o much the comfort of neatne&s;s, as the prai&s;e of neatne&s;s which &s;he co|veted. A &s;pot on her hearth, or a bit of ru&s;t on a
<PB N="3" REF="3">bra&s;s candle&s;tick would throw her into a violent pa&s;&s;ion. Now it is very right to keep the hearth clean and the candle&s;tick bright, but it is very wrong &s;o, to &s;et one's affections on a hearth or a candle&s;tick as to make one&s;elf unhappy if any tri|fling accident happens to them: and if Rebecca had been as careful to keep her heart without &s;pot, or her life without blemi&s;h, as &s;he was to keep her fire-irons free from either, &s;he would have been held up in this hi&s;tory, not as a warning, but a pattern, and in that ca&s;e her nicety would have come in for a part of the prai&s;e. It was no fault in Rebecca but a merit, that her oak table was &s;o bright you could almo&s;t &s;ee to put your cap on in it; but it was no merit but a fault, that when John her hu&s;band laid down his cup of beer upon it &s;o as to leave a mark, &s;he would fly out into &s;o terrible a pa&s;&s;ion that all the children were forced to run to corners; now poor John having no corner to run to, ran to the alehou&s;e, till that which was at fir&s;t a refuge, too &s;oon became a plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>Rebecca never wi&s;hed her children to learn to read, becau&s;e &s;he &s;aid it would only &s;erve to make them lazy, and &s;he her&s;elf had done very well without it. She would keep poor He&s;ter from church to &s;tone the &s;pace under the chairs in fine patterns and whim-whams. I don't pretend to &s;ay there was any harm in this little decoration, it looks pretty enough, and it is better to let the children do that than do nothing. But &s;till the&s;e are not things to &s;et one's heart upon, and be&s;ides, Rebecca only did it as a trap for prai&s;e; for &s;he was &s;ulky and di&s;appointed if any ladies happened
<PB N="4" REF="4">to call in and did not &s;eem delighted with the flowers which &s;he u&s;ed to draw with a burnt &s;tick on the white-wa&s;h of the chimney corners. Be|&s;ides all this finery was often done on a Sunday, and there is a great deal of harm in doing right things at a wrong time, or in wa&s;ting much time on things which are of no real u&s;e, or in doing any thing at all out of vanity. Now I beg that no lazy &s;lattern of a wife will go and take any com|fort in her dirt from what is here &s;aid again&s;t Re|becca's nicety; for I believe that for one who makes her hu&s;band unhappy through neatne&s;s, twenty do &s;o by dirt and lazine&s;s. All exce&s;&s;es are wrong, but the exce&s;s of a good quality is not &s;o common as the exce&s;s of a bad one.</P>
<P>John Wilmot was not an ill-natured man, but he had no fixed principle. In&s;tead of &s;etting him|&s;elf to cure his wife's faults by mild reproof and a good example, he was driven by them into &s;till greater faults him&s;elf. It is a common ca&s;e with people who have no religion when any cro&s;s acci|dent befals them, in&s;tead of trying to make the be&s;t of a bad matter, in&s;tead of con&s;idering their trouble as a trial &s;ent from God to purify them, or in&s;tead of con&s;idering the faults of others as a puni&s;hment for their own &s;ins, what do they do but either &s;ink down at once into de&s;pair, or el&s;e run for comfort into evil cour&s;es. Drinking is the common remedy for &s;orrow, if that can be called a remedy, the end of which is to de&s;troy &s;oul and body. John now began to &s;pend all his lei&s;ure hours at the Bell. He u&s;ed to be fond of his chil|dren, but when he found he could not come home in quiet and play with the little ones, while his wife dre&s;&s;ed him a bit of hot &s;upper, he grew in time not
<PB N="5" REF="5">to come home at all. He who has once taken to drink can &s;eldom be &s;aid to be guilty of one &s;in only; John's heart became hardened. His affec|tion for his family was lo&s;t in &s;elf-indulgence. Pa|tience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the part of his wife might have won much upon a man of John's temper, but in&s;tead of trying to reclaim him, his wife &s;eemed rather to delight in putting him as much in the wrong as &s;he could, that &s;he might be ju&s;tified in her con&s;tant abu&s;e of him. I doubt whether &s;he would have been as much plea&s;ed with his refor|mation as &s;he was with always talking of his faults, though I know it was the opinion of the neigh|bours, that if &s;he had taken as much pains to re|form her hu&s;band by reforming her own temper, as &s;he did to abu&s;e him and expo&s;e him, her endea|vours might have been ble&s;&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s. Good people, who are trying to &s;ubdue their own faults, can hardly believe that the ungodly have a &s;ort of &s;avage &s;atisfaction in trying, by the indulgence of their own evil tempers, to le&s;&s;en the happine&s;s of tho&s;e with whom they have to do. Need we look any farther for a proof of our own corrupt nature, when we &s;ee mankind delight in &s;ins which have neither the temptation of profit or plea&s;ure, &s;uch as plaguing, vexing, or abu&s;ing each other.</P>
<P>He&s;ter was the elde&s;t of their five children, &s;he was a &s;harp &s;en&s;ible girl, but at fourteen years old &s;he could not tell a letter, nor had &s;he ever been taught to bow her knee to him who made her, for John's, or rather Rebecca's hou&s;e, had &s;eldom the name of God pronounced in it, except to be bla&s;|phemed.</P>
<P>It was ju&s;t about this time, if I mi&s;take not, that Mrs. Jones &s;et up her Sunday School, of which Mrs.
<PB N="6" REF="6">Betty Crew, was appointed mi&s;tre&s;s as was related la&s;t month. Mrs. Jones finding that none of the Wil|mots were &s;ent to &s;chool, took a walk to Rebecca's hou&s;e, and civilly told her &s;he called to let her know that a &s;chool was opened to which &s;he de|&s;ired her to &s;end her children on the Sunday fol|lowing, e&s;pecially her elde&s;t daughter He&s;ter. "Well," &s;aid Rebecca, "and what will you give her if I do?" "Give her!" replied Mrs. Jones, "that is rather a rude que&s;tion, and a&s;ked in a rude manner: however, as 'a &s;oft an&s;wer turneth away wrath,' I a&s;&s;ure you that I will give her the be&s;t of learning&punc; I will teach her to <HI>fear God and keep his commandments."</HI> "I would rather you would teach her to fear me, and to keep my hou&s;e clean," &s;aid this wicked woman. "She &s;han't come, however, unle&s;s you will pay her for it." "Pay her for it!" &s;aid the lady, "will it not be reward enough that &s;he will be taught to read the word of God without any expence to you? For though many gifts both of books and cloathing will be given the children, yet you are not to con&s;ider the&s;e gifts &s;o much in the light of payment as an expre&s;&s;ion of good-will in your benefactors." "I &s;ay," interrupted Rebecca, "that He&s;ter &s;han't go to &s;chool. Religion is of no u&s;e that I know of, but to make people hate their own fle&s;h and blood; and I &s;ee no good in learning but to make folks proud, and lazy, and dirty. I cannot tell a letter my&s;elf, and, though I &s;ay it, that &s;hould not &s;ay it, there is not a notabler woman in the pari&s;h." "Pray," &s;aid Mrs. Jones mildly, "do you think that young people will di&s;obey their parents the more for being taught to fear God?" "I don't think any thing about it," &s;aid Rebecca, "I &s;han't
<PB N="7" REF="7">let her come, and there's the long and &s;hort of the matter. He&s;ter has other fi&s;h to fry; but you may have &s;ome of the&s;e little ones if you will?" "No," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "I will not; I have not &s;et up a nur&s;ery but a &s;chool. I am not at all this expence to take crying babes out of the mother's way, but to in&s;truct rea&s;onable beings. And it ought to be a rule in all &s;chools not to take the trouble&s;ome <HI>young</HI> children unle&s;s the mother will try to &s;pare the <HI>elder</HI> ones, who are capable of learning." "But," &s;aid Rebecca, "I have a young child which He&s;ter mu&s;t nur&s;e while I dre&s;s dinner. And &s;he mu&s;t iron the rags, and &s;cour the irons, and dig the po|tatoes, and fetch the water to boil them." "As to nur&s;ing the child, that is indeed a nece&s;&s;ary duty, and He&s;ter ought to &s;tay at home part of the day to enable you to go to church; and families &s;hould relieve each other in this way, but as to all the re&s;t they are no rea&s;ons at all, for the irons need not be &s;coured &s;o often, and the rags &s;hould be ironed, and the potatoes dug, and the water fetched on the Saturday, and I can tell you that neither your mi|ni&s;ter here, nor your judge hereafter, will accept of any &s;uch excu&s;es."</P>
<P>All this while He&s;ter &s;taid behind, pale and trembling, le&s;t her unkind mother &s;hould carry her point. She looked up at Mrs. Jones with &s;o much love and gratitude as to win her affection, and this good lady went on trying to &s;often this har&s;h mo|ther. At la&s;t Rebecca conde&s;cended to &s;ay, "well, I don't know but I may let her come now and then when I can &s;pare her, provided I &s;ind you make it worth her while." All this time &s;he had never a&s;ked Mrs. Jones to &s;it down, nor had once bid her young children be quiet, though they were
<PB N="8" REF="8">crying and &s;qualling the whole time. Rebecca fancied this rudene&s;s was the only way &s;he had of &s;hewing &s;he thought her&s;elf as good as her gue&s;t, but Mrs. Jones never lo&s;t her temper. The mo|ment &s;he went out of the hou&s;e, Rebecca called out loud enough for her to hear, and ordered He&s;ter to get the &s;tone and a bit of &s;and to &s;crub out the prints of that dirty woman's &s;hoes. He&s;ter in high &s;pirits cheerfully obeyed, and rubbed out the &s;tains &s;o neatly, that her mother could not help lamenting that &s;o handy a girl was going to be &s;poiled by being taught godline&s;s, and learning, and &s;uch non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones, who knew the world, told her agent, Mrs. Crew, that her grand difficulty would ari&s;e not &s;o much from the children as the parents. "The&s;e," &s;aid &s;he, "are apt to fall into that &s;ad mi&s;take, that becau&s;e their children are poor and have little of this world's goods, the mothers mu&s;t make it up to them in fal&s;e indulgence. The children of the gentry are much more reproved and cor|rected for their faults, and bred up in far &s;tricter di&s;cipline. He was a KING who &s;aid, <HI>cha&s;ten thy &s;on, and let not thy rod &s;pare for his crying.</HI> But the more vicious the children are, you mu&s;t re|member the more they &s;tand in need of your in|&s;truction. When they are bad, comfort your&s;elf with thinking, how much wor&s;e they would have been but for you; and what a burthen they would become to &s;ociety if the&s;e evil tempers were to re|ceive no check." The great thing which enabled Mrs. Crew to teach well, was, the deep in&s;ight &s;he had got into the corruption of human nature. And I doubt if any one can make a thoroughly good teacher of religion and morals who wants this
<PB N="9" REF="9">ma&s;ter-key to the heart. Others indeed, may teach knowledge, decency, and good manners. Mrs. Crew who knew that out of the heart proceed lying, theft, and all that train of evils which begin to break out even in young children, applied her labours to correct this root of evil. But though a diligent, &s;he was an humble teacher, well knowing that un|le&s;s the grace of God ble&s;&s;ed her labours, &s;he &s;hould but labour in vain.</P>
<P>He&s;ter Wilmot never failed to attend the &s;chool, whenever her perver&s;e mother would give her leave, and her delight in learning was &s;o great, that &s;he would work early and late to gain a little time for her book. As &s;he had a quick capacity, &s;he learned &s;oon to &s;pell and read, and Mrs. Crew ob&s;erving her diligence, u&s;ed to lend her a book to carry home, that &s;he might pick up a little at odd times. It would be well if teachers would make this di&s;tinction. To give or lend books to tho&s;e who take no delight in them is an u&s;ele&s;s ex|pence; while it is kind and right to a&s;&s;i&s;t well-di&s;|po&s;ed young people with every help of this &s;ort. Tho&s;e who love books &s;eldom hurt them, while the &s;lothful, who hate learning, will wear out a book more in a week than the diligent will do in a year. He&s;ter's way was to read over one que&s;|tion in her catechi&s;m, or one ver&s;e in her Hymn|book, by fire-light before &s;he went to bed; this &s;he thought over in the night, and when &s;he was dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf in the morning &s;he was glad to find &s;he always knew a little more than &s;he had done the morning before. It is not to be believed how much tho&s;e people will be found to have gained at the end of a year, who are accu&s;tomed to work up all the little odd ends and remnants
<PB N="10" REF="10">of time; who are convinced that minutes are no more to be wa&s;ted than pence. Nay, he who finds he has wa&s;ted a &s;hilling may by diligence hope to fetch it up again; but no repentance or indu&s;try can ever bring back one wa&s;ted hour. My good young reader, if ever <HI>you</HI> are tempted to wa&s;te an hour, go and a&s;k a dying man what he would give for that hour which you are throwing away, and according as he an&s;wers, &s;o do you act.</P>
<P>As her mother hated the &s;ight of a book, He&s;ter was forced to learn out of &s;ight: it was no di&s;obe|dience to do this, as long as &s;he wa&s;ted no part of that time which it was her duty to &s;pend in u&s;eful labour. She would have thought it a &s;in to have left her work for her book; but &s;he did not think it wrong to &s;teal time from her &s;leep, and to be learning an hour before the re&s;t of the family were awake. He&s;ter would not neglect the wa&s;hing-tub, or the &s;pinning-wheel, even to get on with her catechi&s;m; but &s;he thought it fair to think over her que&s;tions, while &s;he was wa&s;hing and &s;pinning. In a few months &s;he was able to read fluently in St. John's go&s;pel, which is the ea&s;ie&s;t. But Mrs. Crew did not think it enough that her children could read a chapter, &s;he would make them under&s;tand it al&s;o. It is in a good degree owing to the want of religious knowlege in teachers that there is &s;o little religion in the world. Unle&s;s the Bible is laid open to the under&s;tanding, children may read from Gene&s;is to the Revelation, without any other improvement than barely learning how to pro|nounce the words. Mrs. Crew found there was but one way to compel their attention; this was by obliging them to return back again to her the &s;en&s;e of what &s;he had read to them, and this they might
<PB N="11" REF="11">do in their own words, if they could not remember the words of Scripture. Tho&s;e who had weak capacities would, to be &s;ure, do this but very im|perfectly; but even the weake&s;t if they were wil|ling would retain &s;omething. She &s;o managed that <HI>&s;aying the Catechi&s;m</HI> was not merely an act of the memory, but of the under&s;tanding; for &s;he had ob&s;erved formerly, that tho&s;e who had learned the Catechi&s;m in the common formal way, when they were children, had never under&s;tood it when they became men and women, and it remained in the memory without having made any impre&s;&s;ion on the mind. Thus this fine &s;ummary of the Chri&s;tian re|ligion is con&s;idered as little more than a form of words, the being able to repeat which, is a quali|fication for being confirmed by the Bi&s;hop, in&s;tead of being con&s;idered as really containing tho&s;e grounds of Chri&s;tian faith and practice, by which they are to be confirmed Chrii&s;tans.</P>
<P>Mrs. Crew u&s;ed to &s;ay to Mrs. Jones, "Tho&s;e who teach the poor mu&s;t indeed give line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little, as they can receive it. So that teaching mu&s;t be a great grievance to tho&s;e who do not really make it a <HI>labour of love.</HI> I &s;ee &s;o much levity, ob&s;tinacy, and ignorance, that it keeps my own forbearance in continual exerci&s;e, &s;o that I tru&s;t I am getting good my&s;elf while I am do|ing good to others. No one, Madam, can know till they try, that after they have a&s;ked a poor un|taught child the &s;ame que&s;tion nineteen times, they mu&s;t not lo&s;e their temper, but go on and a&s;k it the twentieth. Now and then, when I am tempted to be impatient, I correct my&s;elf, by thinking over that active proof which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour requires
<PB N="12" REF="12">of our love to him when he &s;ays, <HI>"feed my lambs."</HI></P>
<P>He&s;ter Wilmot had never been bred to go to church, for her father and mother had never thought of going them&s;elves, unle&s;s at a chri&s;tening in their own family, or at a funeral of their neighbours, both of which they con&s;idered merely as opportunities for good eating and drinking, and not as offices of religion.</P>
<P>As poor He&s;ter had no comfort at home, it was the le&s;s wonder &s;he delighted in her &s;chool, her Bible and church, for &s;o great is God's goodne&s;s, that he is plea&s;ed to make religion a peculiar comfort to tho&s;e who have no other comfort. The God who&s;e name &s;he had &s;eldom heard but when it was <HI>taken in vain,</HI> was now revealed to her as a God of infinite power, ju&s;tice and holi|ne&s;s. What &s;he read in her Bible, and what &s;he felt in her own heart, convinced her &s;he was a &s;inner; and her catechi&s;m &s;aid the &s;ame. She was much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed one day on thinking over this pro|mi&s;e which &s;he had ju&s;t made (in an&s;wer to the que&s;tion which fell to her lot) "To renounce the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the &s;inful lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h." I &s;ay &s;he was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed on finding that the&s;e were not merely certain words which &s;he was bound to repeat; but certain conditions which &s;he was bound to perform. She was &s;adly puzzled to know how this was to be done, till &s;he met with the&s;e words in her Bible. <HI>My grace is &s;ufficient for thee.</HI> But &s;till &s;he was at a lo&s;s to know how this grace was to be obtained. Happily Mr. Simp&s;on preached on the next Sunday from this text, <HI>A&s;k and ye &s;hall have,</HI> &amp;c. In this &s;ermon was ex|plained to her the nature, the duty, and the efficacy
<PB N="13" REF="13">of prayer. After this &s;he opened her heart to Mrs. Crew, who taught her the great doctrines of Scrip|ture, in a &s;erious, but plain way. He&s;ter's own heart led her to a&s;&s;ent to that humbling doctrine of the catechi&s;m, that <HI>We are by nature born in &s;in;</HI> and truly glad was &s;he to be relieved by hearing of <HI>that &s;piritual grace by which we have a new birth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Thus her mind was no &s;ooner humbled by one part, than it gained comfort from another. On the other hand, while &s;he was re|joicing in <HI>a lively hope God's mercy through Chri&s;t,</HI> her mi&s;tre&s;s put her in mind that that was the only <HI>true</HI> repentance, <HI>by which we for&s;ake &s;in.</HI> Thus the catechi&s;m explained by a pious teacher was found to contain <HI>All the articles of the Chri&s;tian faith.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. Jones greatly di&s;approved the practice of turning away the &s;cholars, becau&s;e they were grown up. "Young people," &s;aid &s;he, "want to be warned at &s;ixteen more than they did at &s;ix, and they are commonly turned adrift at the very age when they want mo&s;t in&s;truction; when dangers and tempta|tions mo&s;t be&s;et them. They are expo&s;ed to more evil by the lei&s;ure of a Sunday evening than by the bu&s;ine&s;s of the whole week: but then religion mu&s;t be made plea&s;ant, and in&s;truction mu&s;t be car|ried in a kind, and agreeable, and familiar way. If they once di&s;like the teacher they will &s;oon get to di&s;like what is taught, &s;o that a ma&s;ter or mi&s;|tre&s;s is in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;werable for the future piety of young per&s;ons, ina&s;much as that piety de|pends on their manner of making religion plea&s;ant as well as profitable." To attend Mrs, Jones's even|ing in&s;tructions was &s;oon thought not a ta&s;k but a holiday. In a few months it was reckoned a di&s;ad|vantage to the character of any young per&s;on in the
<PB N="14" REF="14">pari&s;h to know they did not attend the evening &s;chool. At fir&s;t, indeed, many of them came only with a view to learn to &s;ing p&s;alms; but, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, they grew fond of in&s;truction, and &s;ome of them be|came truly pious. Mrs. Jones &s;poke to them one Sun|day evening as follows: "My dear young women, I rejoice at your improvement; but I rejoice with trembling. I have known young people &s;et out well, who afterwards fell off. The heart is de|ceitful. Many like religious knowledge, who do not like the &s;trictne&s;s of a religious life. I mu&s;t therefore watch whether tho&s;e who are diligent at church and &s;chool are diligent in their daily walk. Whether tho&s;e who &s;ay they believe in God, re|ally obey him. Whether they who profe&s;s to love Chri&s;t keep his commandments. Tho&s;e who hear them&s;elves commended for early piety, may learn to re&s;t &s;atisfied with the prai&s;e of man. People may get a knack at religious phra&s;es without being re|ligious; they may even get to frequent places of wor&s;hip as an amu&s;ement, in order to meet their friends, and may learn to delight in a &s;ort of <HI>&s;piritual go&s;&s;ip,</HI> while religion has no power in their hearts. But I hope better things of you, though I thus &s;peak."</P>
<P>What became of He&s;ter Wilmot, with &s;ome ac|count of Mrs. Jones's May-day fea&s;t for her &s;chool, my readers &s;hall be told next month.</P>
