<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>THE following Piece was de&s;ign'd as a Kind of Mirror to the pre&s;ent Rebellion; and the ima|gined: Advantage of having it acted before that unnatu|ral Flame could be extingui&s;h'd, was the Rea&s;on why it was &s;o hurry'd in the writing; being begun and fini&s;h'd in le&s;s Time than is nece&s;&s;ary tor the forming the Fable only of a correct Play. It was the &s;ix Weeks Labour of an Actor, who, even in that &s;hort Space, was often call'd from it by his Profe&s;&s;ion. The Players, for the Sake of Di&s;patch, had it to &s;tudy, Act by Act, ju&s;t as it was blotted; and the only Revi&s;als it received, from the <HI>Brouillon</HI> to the <HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> were at the Rehear&s;als of it. So that we mu&s;t be&s;peak the Reader's Indulgence for numberle&s;s Incorrections thro' the Whole; but more particularly for the Mea&s;ure and Diction; the Author having neglected them &s;o much, that he cannot call the Manner, in which it is written, either Pro&s;e or Ver&s;e, but accidentally both. It is certain, Apologies for bad writing &s;eldom procure Re|mi&s;&s;ion from the Rigid; yet the mo&s;t flagrant Crimes when ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s'd, and follow'd by Repentance, admit of Extenuation from the Benevolent.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Lines mark'd with Commas were omitted after the fir&s;t Night's acting, the Play being too long in the Performance.</P>

<L>BReathes there a <HI>Briton</HI> longs for Popi&s;h Chains,</L>
<L>While <HI>Smithfield</HI> Fire our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Annals Stains;</L>
<L>When <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Rage and Per&s;ecution blaz'd</L>
<L>With <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Blood on Altars <HI>Rome</HI> had rai&s;ed;</L>
<L>When Matrons &s;aw their Sons in Flames expire,</L>
<L>Their Husbands crackling in religious Fire.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Rome</HI> gave Laws, our Kings and Council &s;way'd,</L>
<L>While <HI>Albion</HI> mourn'd her Liberties betray'd.</L>
<L>But now &s;he &s;miles; our Laws are all our own,</L>
<L>Which rule alike the Cottage and the Throne.</L>
<L>No Tools of Power our Properties invade,</L>
<L>No Heads are chopt for Plots the Court hath made.</L>
<L>By &s;uch ba&s;e Arts her Empire <HI>Rome</HI> maintains,</L>
<L>Axes her Arguments, her Logic Chains;</L>
<L>To the&s;e a Martyr gallant <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> fell,</L>
<L>And <HI>Sidney</HI> bled, who&s;e Crime was writing well.</L>
<L>But under <HI>George</HI> &s;uch Practice is unknown,</L>
<L>For free-born Subjects guard and grace his Throne.</L>
<L>A Prince like him our Author &s;hews to Night,</L>
<L>Who fought for Freedom and his regal Right.</L>
<L>The temporary Piece in Ha&s;te was writ,</L>
<L>The &s;ix Weeks Labour of a puny Wit;</L>
<L>With melting Mea&s;ure, Critic Rules unfraught,</L>
<L>Artle&s;s he writes,&mdash;ju&s;t as rude Nature taught:</L>
<L>No golden Lines, no poli&s;h'd Ver&s;e hath he,</L>
<L>But all like <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Courage, rough and free.</L>
<L>For once then&mdash;</L>
<L>Judge not by Critic, but by patriot Laws;</L>
