<HEAD>THE HERMIT.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FAR in a Wild, unknown to public View,</L>
<L>From Youth to Age a rev'rend <HI>Hermit</HI> grew;</L>
<L>The Mo&s;s his Bed, the Cave his humble Cell,</L>
<L>His Food the Fruits, his Drink the chry&s;tal Well:</L>
<L>Remote from Man, with God he pa&s;s'd the Days,</L>
<L>Pray'r all his Bus'ne&s;s, all his Plea&s;ure Prai&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Life &s;o &s;acred, &s;uch &s;erene Repo&s;e,</L>
<L>Seem'd Heav'n it&s;elf, 'till one Sugge&s;stion ro&s;e;</L>
<L>That Vice &s;hould triumph, Virtue Vice obey,</L>
<L>This &s;prung &s;ome Doubt of Providence's Sway:</L>
<L>His Hopes no more a certain Pro&s;pect boa&s;t,</L>
<L>And all the Tenour of his Soul is lo&s;t:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3">So when a &s;mooth Expan&s;e receives impre&s;t</L>
<L>Calm Nature's Image on it's wat'ry Brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Down bend the Banks, the Trees depending grow,</L>
<L>And Skies beneath with an&s;w'ring Colours glow:</L>
<L>But if a Stone the gentle Scene divide,</L>
<L>Swift ruffling Circles curl on ev'ry Side,</L>
<L>And glimmering Fragments of a broken Sun,</L>
<L>Banks, Trees, and Skies, in thick Di&s;order run.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To clear this Doubt, to know the World by Sight,</L>
<L>To find if Books, or Swains, report it right;</L>
<L>(For yet by Swains alone the World he knew,</L>
<L>Who&s;e Feet came wand'ring o'er the nightly Dew)</L>
<L>He quits his Cell; the Pilgrim-Staff he bore,</L>
<L>And fix'd the Scallop in his Hat before;</L>
<L>Then with the Sun a ri&s;ing Journey went,</L>
<L>Sedate to think, and watching each Event.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Morn was wa&s;ted in the pathle&s;s Gra&s;s,</L>
<L>And long and lone&s;ome was the Wild to pa&s;s;</L>
<L>But when the <HI>Southern</HI> Sun had warm'd the Day,</L>
<L>A Youth came po&s;ting o'er a cro&s;&s;ing Way;</L>
<L>His Rayment decent, his Complexion fair,</L>
<L>And &s;oft in graceful Ringlets wav'd his Hair.</L>
<L>Then near aproaching, Father Hail! he cry'd,</L>
<L>And Hail, my Son, the rev'rend Sire reply'd;</L>
<L>Words followed Words, from Que&s;tion An&s;wer flow'd</L>
<L>And talk of various kind deceiv'd the Road;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4">'Till each with other pleas'd, and loth to part,</L>
<L>While in their Age they differ, join in Heart:</L>
<L>Thus &s;tands an aged Elm and Ivy bound,</L>
<L>Thus youthful Ivy cla&s;ps an Elm around.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now &s;unk the &s;un; the clo&s;ing Hour of Day</L>
<L>Came onward, mantled o'er with &s;ober grey;</L>
<L>Nature in Silence bid the World repo&s;e:</L>
<L>When near the Road a &s;tately Palace ro&s;e:</L>
<L>There by the Moon thro' Ranks of Trees they pa&s;s,</L>
<L>Who&s;e Verdure crown'd their &s;loping Sides of Gra&s;s.</L>
<L>It chanc'd the noble Ma&s;ter of the Dome,</L>
<L>Still made his Hou&s;e the wand'ring Strangers home:</L>
<L>Yet &s;till the Kindne&s;s, from a Thir&s;t of Prai&s;e,</L>
<L>Prov'd the vain Flouri&s;h of expen&s;ive Ea&s;e.</L>
<L>The Pair arriv'd: the liv'ry Servants wait;</L>
<L>The Lord receives them at the pompous Gate.</L>
<L>The Table groans with co&s;tly Piles of Food,</L>
<L>And all is more than Ho&s;pitably good,</L>
<L>Then led to re&s;t, the Day's long Toil they drown,</L>
<L>Deep &s;unk in Sleep, and Silk, and Heaps of Down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At lenth'tis Morn, and at the Dawn of Day,</L>
<L>Along the wide Canals the <HI>Zephyrs</HI> Play;</L>
<L>Fre&s;h o'er the gay Parterres the Breezes creep,</L>
<L>And &s;hake the neigh'bring Wood to bani&s;h Sleep,</L>
<L>Up ri&s;e the Gue&s;ts, obedient to the Call,</L>

<L><PB N="5" REF="5">Rich lucious Wine a golden Goblet grac't,</L>
<L>Which the kind Ma&s;ter &s;orc'd the Gue&s;ts to ta&s;te.</L>
<L>Then pleas'd and thankful from the Porch they go,</L>
<L>And, but the Landlord, none had cau&s;e of Woe;</L>
<L>His <HI>Cup</HI> was vani&s;h'd; for in &s;ecret Gui&s;e</L>
<L>The younger Gue&s;t purloin'd the glittering Prize.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As one who &s;piss a Serpent in his Way,</L>
<L>Gli&s;t'ning and ba&s;king in the Summer Ray,</L>
<L>Di&s;order'd &s;tops to &s;hun the Danger near,</L>
<L>Then walks with Faintne&s;s on, and looks with Fear;,</L>
<L>So &s;eem'd the Sire; when far upon the Road,</L>
<L>The &s;hining Spoil his wilely Partner &s;how'd:</L>
<L>He &s;topp'd with Silence, walk'd with trembling Heart,</L>
<L>And much he wi&s;h'd, but dur&s;t not a&s;k to part:</L>
<L>Murm'ring he lifts his Eyes, and thinks it hard,</L>
<L>That generous Actions meet a ba&s;e Reward.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thus they pa&s;s, the Sun his Glory &s;hrouds,</L>
<L>The changing Skies hang out their Sable Clouds,</L>
<L>A Sound in Air pre&s;ag'd approaching Rain,</L>
<L>And Bea&s;ts to covert &s;cud a-cro&s;s the Plain.</L>
<L>Warn'd by the Signs, the wand'ring Pair retreat.</L>
<L>To &s;eek, for Shelter at a neighb'ring Seat.</L>
<L>'Twas built with Turrets, on a ri&s;ing Ground,</L>
<L>And &s;trong, and large, unimprov'd around;</L>
<L>Its Owner's Temper, tim'rous and &s;evere,</L>
<L>Unkind and griping, caus'd a De&s;ert there.</L>

<L>As near the <HI>Mi&s;er</HI>'s heavy Doors they drew,</L>

<L>The nimble Light'ning mix'd with Show'rs began,</L>
<L>And o'er their Heads loud rolling Thunder ran.</L>
<L>Here long they knock, but knock or call in vain,</L>
<L>Driv'n by the Wind, and batter'd by the Rain.</L>
<L>At lenth &s;ome Pity warm'd the Ma&s;ter's Brea&s;t,</L>
<L>('Twas then, his Thre&s;hold fir&s;t receiv'd a Gue&s;t)</L>
<L>Slow creaking turns the Door with jealous Care,</L>
<L>And half he welcomes in the &s;hivering Pair;</L>
<L>One frugal Faggot lights the naked Walls,</L>
<L>And Nature's Fervor thro' their Limbs recals:</L>
<L>Bread of the cour&s;e&s;t &s;ort, with eager Wine,</L>
<L>(Each hardly granted) &s;erv'd them both to dine;</L>
<L>And when the Tempe&s;t fir&s;t appear'd to cea&s;e,</L>

<L>But what new Marks of Wonder &s;oon took place,</L>
<L>In ev'ry &s;ettling Feature of his Face!</L>
<L>When from his Ve&s;t the young Companion bore</L>
<L>That <HI>Cup,</HI> the gen'rous Landlord own'd before,</L>
<L>And paid profu&s;ely with the precious Bowl</L>
<L>The &s;tinted Kindne&s;s of this churli&s;h Soul.</L>
