<HEAD>A LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>A SPEECH which has been printed in &s;everal of the Briti&s;h and New-York News-papers, as coming from your Lord&s;hip, in an&s;wer to one from the Duke of Richmond of the 10th of July la&s;t, con|tains expre&s;&s;ions and opinions &s;o new and &s;ingular, and &s;o enveloped in my&s;terious rea&s;oning, that I addre&s;s this publication to you, for the purpo&s;e of giving them a free and candid examination. The &s;peech I allude to is in the&s;e words:</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3"><Q>HIS Lord&s;hip &s;aid, it had been men|tioned in another place, that he had been guilty of incon&s;i&s;tence. To clear him&s;elf of this, he a&s;&s;erted that he &s;till held the &s;ame principles in re&s;pect to American In|dependence, which he at fir&s;t imbibed. He had been, and yet was of opinion, whenever the Parliament of Great Britain acknowledges that point, the &s;un of En|gland's glory is &s;et for ever. Such were the &s;entiments he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on a former day, and &s;uch the &s;entiments he conti|nued to hold at this hour. It was the opinion of Lord Chatham, as well as many able &s;tate&s;men. Other noble Lords, how|ever, think differently; and as the majority of the Cabinet &s;upport them, he acquie&s;ced in the mea&s;ure, di&s;&s;enting from the idea; and the point is &s;ettled for bringing the mat|ter into the full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of Parliament, where it will be candidly, fairly, and im|partially
<PB N="3" REF="4">debated. The independence of America would end in the ruin of En|gland; and that a peace patched up with France would give that proud enemy the means of yet trampling on this country. The &s;un of England's glory he wi&s;hed not to &s;ee &s;et for ever; he looked for a &s;park at lea&s;t to be left, which might in time light us up to a new day. But if Independence was to be granted, if Parliament deem|ed that mea&s;ure prudent, he fore&s;aw in his own mind that England was undone. He wi&s;hed to God that he had been deputed to Congre&s;s, that he might plead the cau&s;e of that country as well as of this, and that he might exerci&s;e whatever powers he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, as an orator, to &s;ave both from ruin, in a conviction to Congre&s;s, that, if their Independence was &s;igned, their liberties were gone for ever.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">PEACE, his Lord&s;hip added was a de|&s;irable object, but it mu&s;t be an honour|able peace, and not an humiliating one, dictated by France, or in&s;i&s;ted on by Ame|rica. It was very true, this kingdom was not in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate, it was impo|veri&s;hed by war. But if we were not rich, it was evident that France was poor. If we were &s;traitened in our finances, the enemy were exhau&s;ted in their re&s;our|ces. This was a great empire; it a|bounded with brave men, who were able and willing to fight in a common cau&s;e; the language of humiliation &s;hould not therefore be the language of Great Britain. His Lord&s;hip &s;aid, that he was not a&s;hamed nor afraid of tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions going to America. There were numbers, great numbers there, who were of the &s;ame way of thinking, in re&s;pect to that country
<PB N="5" REF="6">being dependent on this, and who, with his Lord&s;hip, perceived ruin and Indepen|dence linked together.</P>
<P>THUS far the &s;peech; on which I remark, &mdash;That his Lord&s;hip is a total &s;tranger to the mind and &s;entiments of America; that he has wrapped him&s;elf up in fond delu&s;ion that &s;omething le&s;s than Independence may, under his Admini&s;tration, be accepted; and he wi&s;hes him&s;elf &s;ent to Congre&s;s, to prove the mo&s;t extraordinary of all doctrines, which is, that INDEPENDENCE, the &s;ublime&s;t of all human conditions, is lo&s;s of liberty.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to which we may &s;ay, that in order to know what the contrary word DE|PENDENCE means, we have only to look back to tho&s;e years of &s;evere humiliation, when the milde&s;t of all petitions could obtain no other notice than the haughtie&s;t of all in|&s;ults:
<PB N="6" REF="7">and when the ba&s;e terms of uncon|ditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion were demanded, or un|di&s;tingui&s;hable de&s;truction threatened. It is nothing to us that the Mini&s;try have been changed, for they may be changed again. The guilt of Government is the crime of a whole country; and the nation that can, though but for a moment, think and act as England has done, can never afterwards be believed or tru&s;ted. There are ca&s;es in which it is as impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;tore character to life, as it is to recover the dead. It is a phoenix that can expire but once, and from who&s;e a&s;hes there is no re&s;urrection. Some offences are of &s;uch a &s;light compo&s;ition, that they reach no further than the temper, and are created or cured by a thought. But the &s;in of England has &s;truck the heart of America, and nature has not left it in our power to &s;ay we can forgive.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">YOUR Lord&s;hip wi&s;hes for an opportunity to plead before Congre&s;s <HI>the cau&s;e of England and America, and to &s;ave, as you &s;ay, both from ruin.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the country, which, for more than &s;even years, has &s;ought our de&s;truction, &s;hould now cringe to &s;olicit our protection, is adding the wretchedne&s;s of di&s;grace to the mi&s;ery of di&s;appointment; and if England has the lea&s;t &s;park of &s;uppo&s;ed honour left, that &s;park mu&s;t be darkened by a&s;king, and extingui&s;hed by receiving, the &s;malle&s;t fa|vour from America: For the criminal who owes his life to the grace and mercy of the injured, is more executed by living than he who dies.</P>
<P>BUT a thou&s;and pleadings, even from your Lord&s;hip, can have no effect. Honor, in|tere&s;t, and every &s;en&s;ation of the heart would plead again&s;t you. We are a people who
<PB N="8" REF="9">think not as you think; and what is equally true, you cannot feel as we feel. The &s;itua|tions of the two countries are exceedingly different. We have been the &s;eat of war: You have &s;een nothing of it. The mo&s;t wanton de&s;truction has been committed in our &s;ight; the mo&s;t in&s;olent barbarity has been acted on our feelings. We can look round and &s;ee the remains of burnt and de|&s;troyed hou&s;es, once the fair fruit of hard indu&s;try, and now the &s;triking monuments of Briti&s;h brutality. We walk over the dead whom we loved, in every part of America, and remember by whom they fell. There is &s;carcely a village but brings to life &s;ome melancholy thought, and reminds us of what we have &s;uffered, and of tho&s;e we have lo&s;t by the bruti&s;hne&s;s of Britain. A thou&s;and images ari&s;e to us, which, from &s;ituation, you cannot &s;ee, and are accompa|nied
<PB N="9" REF="10">by as many ideas which you cannot know; and therefore your &s;uppo&s;ed &s;y&s;tem of rea&s;oning would apply to nothing, and all your expectations die of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE que&s;tion, whether England &s;hall ac|cede to the Independence of America, and which your Lord&s;hip &s;ays is to undergo a par|liamentary di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, is &s;o very &s;imple, and compo&s;ed of &s;o few ca&s;es, that it &s;carcely needs a debate.</P>
<P>IT is the only way out of an expen&s;ive and ruinous war, which has now no object, and without which acknowledgement there can be no peace.</P>
<P>BUT your Lord&s;hip &s;ays, <HI>"The &s;un of Great-Britain will &s;et whenever &s;he acknow|ledges the Independence of America."</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="10" REF="11">Whereas the metaphor would have been &s;trictly ju&s;t to have left the &s;un wholly out of the figure, and have a&s;cribed her not ac|knowledging it to the influence of the moon.</P>
<P>BUT the expre&s;&s;ion, if true, is the greate&s;t confe&s;&s;ion of di&s;grace that could be made, and furni&s;hes America with the highe&s;t no|tions of &s;overeign independent importance. Mr. Wedderburne, about the year 1776, made u&s;e of an idea of much the &s;ame kind. &mdash; <Q><HI>Relinqui&s;h America!</HI> &s;ays he: <HI>What is it but to de&s;ire a giant to &s;hrink &s;pontaneou&s;ly into a dwarf.</HI></Q></P>
<P>ALAS! are tho&s;e people who call them|&s;elves Engli&s;hmen, of &s;o little internal con&s;e|quence, that when America is gone, or &s;huts her eyes upon them, their &s;un is &s;et, they
<PB N="11" REF="12">can &s;hine no more, but grope about in ob|&s;curity, and contract into in&s;ignificant ani|mals? Was America, then, the giant of the empire, and England only her dwarf in waiting? Is the ca&s;e &s;o &s;trangely altered, that tho&s;e who once thought we could not live without them, now declare they cannot exi&s;t without us? Will they tell to the world, and that from their fir&s;t Mini&s;ter of State, that America is their all in all; that it is by her importance only they can live, and breathe, and have a being? Will they, who threatened to bring us to their feet, now ca&s;t them&s;elves at ours, and own that without us they are not a nation? Are they become &s;o unqualified to debate on Independence, that they have lo&s;t all idea of it in them&s;elves, and are call|ing to the rocks and mountains of America to cover their in&s;ignificance? Or, if America is lo&s;t, is it manly to &s;ob over it like a child
<PB N="12" REF="13">for its rattle, and invite the laughter of the world, by declarations of di&s;grace? Surely, the more con&s;i&s;tent conduct would be, to bear it without complaint; and to &s;hew that England, without America, can pre&s;erve her Independence, and a &s;uitable rank with other European Powers. You were not contented while you had her, and to weep for her now is childi&s;h.</P>
<P>BUT Lord Shelburne thinks that &s;ome|thing may yet be done. What that &s;ome|thing is, or how it is to be accompli&s;hed, is a matter in ob&s;curity. By arms there is no hope. The experience of nearly eight years, with the expence of an hundred million pounds &s;terling, and the lo&s;s of two armies, mu&s;t po&s;itively decide that point. Be&s;ides, the Briti&s;h have lo&s;t their intere&s;t in America with the di&s;affected. Every part of it has
<PB N="13" REF="14">been tried. There is no new &s;cene left for delu&s;ion: and the thou&s;ands who have been ruined by adhering to them, and have now to quit the &s;ettlements they had acquired, and be conveyed like tran&s;ports to cultivate the de&s;arts of Augu&s;tine and Nova Scotia, has put an end to all further expections of aid.</P>
<P>IF you ca&s;t your eyes on the people of England, what have they to con&s;ole them|&s;elves with for the millions expended; or what encouragement is there left to continue throwing good money after bad? America can carry on the war for ten years longer, and all the charges of government included, for le&s;s than you can defray the charges of war and government for one year. And I, who know both countries, know well, that the people of America can afford to pay their
<PB N="14" REF="15">&s;hare of the expence much better than the people of England can. Be&s;ides, it is their own e&s;tates and property, their own rights, liberties and government, they are defend|ing; and were they not to do it, they would de&s;erve to lo&s;e all, and none would pity them. The fault would be their own, and their puni&s;hment ju&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Briti&s;h army in America care not how long the war la&s;ts. They enjoy an ea&s;y and indolent life. They fatten on the folly of one country and the &s;poils of aother; and, between their plunder and their pay, may go home rich. But the ca&s;e is very different with the labouring farmer, the working trade&s;man, and the nece&s;&s;itous poor in England, the &s;weat of who&s;e brow goes day after day to feed, in prodigality and &s;loth, the army that is robbing both them and us.
<PB N="15" REF="16">Removed from the eye of the country that &s;upports them, and di&s;tant from the govern|ment that employs them, they cut and carve for them&s;elves, and there is none to call them to account.</P>
<P>BUT England will be ruined, &s;ays Lord Shelburne, if America is independent.</P>
<P>THEN, I &s;ay, is England already ruined, for America is already independent: and if Lord Shelburne will not allow this, he im|mediately denies the fact which he infers. Be&s;ides, to make England the mere creature of America, is paying too great a compliment to us, and too little to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT the declaration is a rhap&s;ody of in|con&s;i&s;tence. For to &s;ay, as Lord Shelburne has numberle&s;s times &s;aid, that the war
<PB N="16" REF="17">again&s;t America is ruinous, and yet to con|tinue the pro&s;ecution of that ruinous war for the purpo&s;e of avoiding ruin, is a language which cannot be under&s;tood. Neither is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee how the Independence of America is to accompli&s;h the ruin of En|gland after the war is over, and yet not effect it before. America cannot be more inde|pendent of her, nor a greater enemy to her, hereafter than &s;he is now; nor England derive le&s;s advantages from her than at pre&s;ent: Why then is ruin to follow in the be&s;t &s;tate of the ca&s;e, and not in the wor&s;t? And if not in the wor&s;t, why is it to follow at all?</P>
<P>THAT a nation is to be ruined by peace and commerce, and fourteen or fifteen mil|lions a-year le&s;s expences than before, is a new doctrine in politics. We have heard
<PB N="17" REF="18">much clamour of national &s;avings and oeco|nomy; but &s;urely the true oeconomy would be, to &s;ave the whole charege of a &s;illy, fooli&s;h, and head&s;trong war; becau&s;e, compared with this, all other retrenchments are baubles and trifles.</P>
<P>BUT is it po&s;&s;ible that Lord Shelburne can be &s;erious in &s;uppo&s;ing the lea&s;t advantage can be obtained by arms, or that any advantage can be equal to the expence, or the danger of attempting it? Will not the capture of one army after another &s;atisfy him, but all mu&s;t become pri&s;oners? Mu&s;t England ever be the &s;port of hope, and the dupe of delu&s;ion? Some|times our currency was to fail; another time our army was to di&s;band: then whole provinces were to revolt. Such a General &s;aid this and that; another wrote &s;o and &s;o. Lord Chatham was of this opinion; and
<PB N="18" REF="19">Lord Somebody el&s;e of another. To-day 20,000 Ru&s;&s;ians and 20 Ru&s;&s;ian &s;hips of the line were to come; to-morrow the Empre&s;s was abu&s;ed without mercy or decency.&mdash; Then the Emperor of Germany was to be bribed with a million of money, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was to do wonderful things. At one time it was, Lo here! and then it was, Lo there! Sometimes this Power, and &s;ome|times that Power, was to engage in the war, ju&s;t as if the whole world was as mad and fooli&s;h as Britain. And thus, from year to year, has every &s;traw been catched at, and every Will-with-a-wi&s;p led them a new dance.</P>
<P>THIS year a &s;till newer folly is to take place. Lord Shelburne wi&s;hes to be &s;ent to Congre&s;s, and he think that &s;omething may be done.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">ARE not the repeated declarations of Con|gre&s;s, and which all America &s;upports, that they will not even hear any propo&s;als what|ever, until the unconditional and unequi|vocal Independence of America is recogni&s;ed; are not, I &s;ay, the&s;e declarations an&s;wer enough?</P>
<P>BUT for England to receive any thing from America now, after &s;o many in&s;ults, injuries, and outrages, acted towards us, would &s;hew &s;uch a &s;pirit of meanne&s;s in her, that we could not but de&s;pi&s;e her for accept|ing it. And &s;o far from Lord Shelburne coming here to &s;olicit it, it would be the greate&s;t di&s;grace we could do them to offer it. England would appear a wretch indeed, at this time of day, to a&s;k or owe any thing to the bounty of America. Has not the name of Engli&s;hman blots enough upon it,
<PB N="20" REF="21">without inventing more? Even Lucifer would &s;corn to reign in Heaven by per|mi&s;&s;ion, and yet an Engli&s;hman can creep for only an entrance into America. Or has a land of liberty &s;o many charms, that to be a door-keeper in it is better than to be an Engli&s;h Mini&s;ter of State?</P>
<P>BUT what can this expected &s;omething be? or, if obtained, what can it amount to but new di&s;graces, contentions, and quarrels? The people of America have for years accu&s;|tomed them&s;elves to think and &s;peak &s;o free|ly and contemptuou&s;ly of Engli&s;h authority, and the inveteracy is &s;o deeply rooted, that a per&s;on inve&s;ted with any authority from that country, and attempting to exerci&s;e it here, would have the life of a toad under a har|row. They would look on him as an inter|loper, to whom their compa&s;&s;ion permitted
<PB N="21" REF="22">a re&s;idence. He would be no more than the Mungo of the farce; and if he di&s;liked that, he mu&s;t &s;et off. It would be a &s;tation of de|gradation, deba&s;ed by our pity, and de&s;pi&s;ed by our pride, and would place England in a more contemptible &s;ituation than any &s;he has yet &s;uffered by the war. We have too high an opinion of our&s;elves, ever to think of yielding again the lea&s;t obedience to out|landi&s;h authority; and for a thou&s;and rea|&s;ons, England would be the la&s;t country in the world to yield it to. She has been trea|cherous, and we know it. Her character is gone, and we have &s;een the funeral.</P>
<P>SURELY &s;he loves to fi&s;h in troubled wa|ters, and drink the cup of contention, or &s;he would not now think of mingling her affairs with tho&s;e of America. It would be like a fooli&s;h dotard taking to his arms the bride
<PB N="22" REF="23">that de&s;pi&s;es him, or who has placed on his head the en&s;igns of her di&s;gu&s;t. It is ki&s;&s;ing the hand that boxes his ears, and propo&s;ing to renew the exchange. The though is as &s;ervile as the war was wicked, and &s;hews the la&s;t &s;cence of the drama as incon&s;i&s;tent as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>As America is gone, the only act of man|hood is to <HI>let her go.</HI> Your Lord&s;hip had no hand in the &s;eparation, and you will gain no honour by tempori&s;ing politicks. Be|&s;ides, there is &s;omething &s;o exceedingly whim&s;ical, un&s;teady, and even in&s;incere in the pre&s;ent conduct of England, that &s;he ex|hibits her&s;elf in mo&s;t di&s;honourable colours.</P>
<P>ON the &s;econd of Augu&s;t la&s;t General Carleton and Admiral Digby wrote to Ge|neral Wa&s;hington in the&s;e words:
<Q><PB N="23" REF="24">
THE re&s;olutions of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons of the 27th of February la&s;t have been placed in your Excellency's hands, and intimations given at the &s;ame time, that further pacific mea&s;ures were likely to follow. Since which, until the pre&s;ent time, we have had no direct communica|tions from England; but a mail is now arrived, which brings us very impor|tant information. We are acquainted, Sir, <HI>by authority,</HI> that negotiations for a gene|ral peace have already commenced at Paris, and that Mr. Grenville is inve&s;ted with full powers to treat with all the parties at war, and is now at Paris in the execution of his commi&s;&s;ion. And we are farther, Sir, made acquainted, <HI>that his Maje&s;ty, in order to remove all ob&s;tacles to that peace which he &s;o ardently wi&s;hes to re&s;tore, has commanded his Mini&s;ters to direct
<PB N="24" REF="25">Mr. Grenville, that the Independence of the Thirteen United Provinces &s;hould be propo&s;ed by him in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, in&s;tead of making it a condition of a general treaty.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now, taking your pre&s;ent mea&s;ures into view, and comparing them with the decla|ration in this Letter, pray what is the word of your King or his Mini&s;ters, or the Parlia|ment, good for? Mu&s;t we not look upon you as a confederated body of faithle&s;s, treache|rous men, who&s;e a&s;&s;urances are fraud, and their language deceit? What opinion can we po&s;&s;ibly form of you, but that you are a lo&s;t, abandoned, profligate nation, who &s;port even with your own character, and are to be held by nothing but the bayonet or the halter?</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">To &s;ay, after this, <HI>that the &s;un of Great Britain will be &s;et whenever &s;he acknowledges the Independence of America,</HI> when the not doing it is the unqualified lie of Government, can be no other than the language of ridi|cule, the jargon of incon&s;i&s;tency. There were thou&s;ands in America who predicted the delu&s;ion, and looked upon it as a trick of trea|chery, to take us from our guard, and draw off our attention from the only &s;y&s;tem of finance, by which we can be called, or de|&s;erve to be called, a &s;overeign, independent people. The fraud, on your part, might be worth attempting, but the &s;acrifice to obtain it is too high.</P>
<P>THERE were others who credited the a&s;|&s;urance, becau&s;e they thought it impo&s;&s;ible that men who had their characters to e&s;ta|bli&s;h would begin it with a lie. The pro|&s;ecution
<PB N="26" REF="27">&s;ecution of the war by the former Mini&s;try was &s;avage and horrid; &s;ince which it has been mean, tricki&s;h, and delu&s;ive. The one went greedily into the pa&s;&s;ion of revenge, the other into the &s;ubtleties of low contri|vance; till, between the crimes of both, there is &s;carcely left a man in America, be he Whig or Tory, who does not de&s;pi&s;e or dete&s;t the conduct of Britain.</P>
<P>THE management of Lord Shelburne, whatever may be his views, is a caution to us, and mu&s;t be to the world, never to re|gard Briti&s;h a&s;&s;urances. A perfidy &s;o no|torious cannot be hid. It &s;tands even in the public papers of New-York, with the names of Carleton and Digby affixed to it. It is a proclamation that the King of England is not to be believed: that the &s;pirit of lying is the governing principle of the Mini&s;try.
<PB N="27" REF="28">It is holding up the character of the Hou&s;e of Commons to public infamy, and warning all men not to credit them. Such is the con&s;e|quence which Lord Shelburne's manage|ment has brought upon his country.</P>
<P>AFTER the authori&s;ed declarations con|tained in Carleton and Digby's letter, you ought, from every motive of honour, policy, and prudence, to have fulfilled them, what|ever might have been the event. It was the lea&s;t atonement you could po&s;&s;ibly make to America, and the greate&s;t kindne&s;s you could do to your&s;elves; for you will &s;ave millions by a general peace, and you will lo&s;e as many by continuing the war.</P>
