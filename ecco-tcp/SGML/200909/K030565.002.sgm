<HEAD>LAW&mdash;As a Science of methodized and artificial Equity, aboli&s;hed in France.</HEAD>
<P>A Government of the nature of that &s;et up at our very door (France) has never been hitherto &s;een or even imagined in Europe. What our relation to it will be cannot be judged by other relations. It is a &s;erious thing to have a connection with a people who live only under po&s;itive, arbitrary, and changeable in&s;titutions; and tho&s;e not perfected nor &s;upplied, nor explained by any common acknowledged rule of moral &s;cience. I remember that in one of my la&s;t conver&s;ations with the late Lord Camden, we were &s;truck much in the &s;ame manner with the abolition in France of the law, as a &s;cience of methodized and artificial equity. France, &s;ince her revolution, is under the &s;way of a &s;ect, who&s;e leaders have deliberately, at one &s;troke, demoli&s;hed the whole body of that juri&s;prudence which France had pretty nearly in common with other civilized coun|tries. In that juri&s;prudence were contained the ele|ments and principles of the law of nations, the great ligament of mankind. With the law they have of cour&s;e de&s;troyed all &s;eminaries in which juri&s;prudence was taught, as well as all the corporations e&s;tabli&s;hed for its con&s;ervation. I have not heard of any coun|try, whether in Europe or A&s;ia, or even in Africa, on this &s;ide of Mount Atlas, which is wholly without &s;ome &s;uch colleges and &s;uch corporations, except France. No man, in a public or private concern, can divine by what rule or principle her judgments are to be directed; nor is there to be found a Profe&s;&s;or in any Univer&s;ity, or a Practitioner in any Court, who will hazard an opinion of what is or is not law in France, in any ca&s;e whatever. They have not only annulled all their old treaties, but they have renounced the law of nations, from whence treaties have their force.
<PB N="178" REF="4">
With a fixed de&s;ign they have outlawed them&s;elves, and to their power outlawed all other nations. In&s;tead of the religion and the law by which they were in a great and politic communion with the Chri&s;tian world, they have con&s;tructed their republic on three ba&s;es, all fundamentally oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e on which the com|munities of Europe are built Its foundation is laid in Regicide, in Jacobini&s;m, and in Athei&s;m; and it has joined to tho&s;e principles a body of &s;y&s;tematic man|ners which &s;ecures their operation.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Regicide Peace.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>LAW OF CHANGE.</HEAD>
<P>WE mu&s;t all obey the great law of change. It is the mo&s;t powerful law of nature, and the means perhaps of its con&s;ervation. All we can do, and that human wi&s;|dom can do, is to provide that the change &s;hall pro|ceed by in&s;en&s;ible degrees. This has all the benefits which may be in change, without any of the inconve|niencies of mutation. Every thing is provided for as it arrives. This mode will, on the one hand, prevent the <HI>unfixing old intere&s;ts at once;</HI> a thing which is apt to breed a black and &s;ullen di&s;content in tho&s;e who are at once di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all their influence and con&s;idera|tion. This gradual cour&s;e, on the other &s;ide, will pre|vent men, long under depre&s;&s;ion, from being intoxicated with a large draught of new power, which they always abu&s;e with a licentious in&s;olence. But wi&s;hing, as I do, the change to be gradual and cautious, I would, in my fir&s;t &s;teps, lean rather to the &s;ide of enlargement than re&s;triction.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Letter to Sir H.

<HEAD>LAWGIVER. Character of a true Lawgiver.</HEAD>
<P>BUT it &s;eems as if it were the prevalent opinion in Paris, that an unfeeling heart, and an undoubting confidence, are the &s;ole qualifications for a perfect legi&s;lator. Far different are my ideas of that high office. The true lawgiver ought to have an heart full of &s;en&s;ibility. He ought to love and re&s;pect his kind, and to fear him&s;elf. It may be allowed to his temperament to catch his ultimate object with an in|tuitive glance; but his movements towards it ought to be deliberate. Political arrangement, as it is a work for &s;ocial ends, is to be only wrought by &s;ocial means. There mind mu&s;t con&s;pire with mind. Time is required to produce that union of minds which alone can produce all the good we aim at. Our pa|tience will atchieve more than our force. If I might venture to appeal to what is &s;o much out of fa&s;hion in Paris, I mean to experience, I &s;hould tell you, that in my cour&s;e I have known, and, accord|ing to my mea&s;ure, have co-operated with great men, and I have never yet &s;een any plan which has not been mended by the ob&s;ervations of tho&s;e who were much inferior in under&s;tanding to the per&s;on who took the lead in the bu&s;ine&s;s. By a &s;low but well-&s;u&s;tained progre&s;s, the effect of each &s;tep is watched; the good or ill &s;ucce&s;s of the fir&s;t, gives light to us in the &s;econd; and &s;o, from light to light, we are conducted with &s;afety through the whole &s;eries. We &s;ee, that the parts of the &s;y&s;tem do not cla&s;h. The evils latent in the mo&s;t promi&s;ing contrivances are provided for as they ari&s;e. One advantage is as little as po&s;&s;ible &s;acrificed to another. We compen&s;ate, we reconcile, we balance. We are enabled to unite into a con&s;i&s;tent whole the various anomalies and contending principles that are found in the minds and affairs of men. From hence ari&s;es, not an excellence in &s;implicity, but one far &s;uperior, an excellence in compo&s;ition. Where the great intere&s;ts of mankind
<PB N="180" REF="6">
are concerned through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of genera|tion, that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion ought to be admitted into &s;ome &s;hare in the councils which are &s;o deeply to affect them. If ju&s;tice requires this, the work it&s;elf re|quires the aid of more minds than one age can fur|ni&s;h. It is from this view of things that the be&s;t legi&s;lators have been often &s;atisfied with the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of &s;ome &s;ure, &s;olid, and ruling principle in government; a power like that which &s;ome of the philo&s;ophers have called a pla&s;tic nature; and having fixed the principle, they have le&s;t it afterwards to its own operation.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Reflections on the Revolution in France.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>LEGISLATOR AND POPULAR GOVERNMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>NO legi&s;lator, at any period of the world, has willingly pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d the &s;eat of active power in the hands of the multitude: becau&s;e there it admits of no control, no regulation, no &s;teady direction what|&s;oever.

<P>As the exorbitant exerci&s;e of power cannot, under popular &s;way, be effectually re&s;trained, the other great object of political arrangement, the means of abating an exce&s;&s;ive de&s;ire of it, is in &s;uch a &s;tate &s;till wor&s;e provided for. The democratic common|wealth is the foodful nur&s;e of ambition. Under the other forms it meets with many re&s;traints. Whenever, in &s;tates which have had a democratic ba&s;is, the le|gi&s;lators have endeavoured to put re&s;traints upon ambition, their methods were as violent, as in the end they were ineffectual; as violent indeed as any the mo&s;t jealous de&s;poti&s;m could invent. The o&s;traci&s;m could not very long &s;ave it&s;elf, and much le&s;s the &s;tate which it was meant to guard, from the attempts of ambition, one of the natural inbred incurable di&s;tempers of a powerful democracy.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Appeal from the new to the old Whigs.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>LIBERTY. Genuine Love of Liberty.</HEAD>
<P>IT is but too true, that the love, and even the very idea, of genuine liberty, is extremely rare. It is but too true, that there are many, who&s;e whole &s;cheme of freedom is made up of pride, perver&s;ene&s;s, and in&s;o|lence.

<HEAD>LOVE. The phy&s;ical Cau&s;e of Love.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we have before us &s;uch objects as excite love and complacency, the body is affected, &s;o far as I could ob&s;erve, much in the following manner: The head reclines &s;omething on one &s;ide; the eye|lids
<PB N="185" REF="11">
are more clo&s;ed than u&s;ual, and the eyes roll gently with an inclination to the object; the mouth is a little opened, and the breath drawn &s;lowly, with now and then a low &s;igh; the whole body is com|po&s;ed, and the hands fall idly to the &s;ides. All this is accompanied with an inward &s;en&s;e of melting and languor. The&s;e appearances are always propor|tioned to the degree of beauty in the object, and of &s;en&s;ibility in the ob&s;erver. And this gradation from the highe&s;t pitch of beauty and &s;en&s;ibility, even to the lowe&s;t of mediocrity and indifference, and their corre&s;pondent effects, ought to be kept in view, el&s;e this de&s;cription will &s;eem exaggerated, which it cer|tainly is not. But from this de&s;cription it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible not to conclude, that beauty acts by re|laxing the &s;olids of the whole &s;y&s;tem. There are all the appearances of &s;uch a relaxation; and a relaxa|tion &s;omewhat below the natural tone &s;eems to me to be the cau&s;e of all po&s;itive plea&s;ure. Who is a &s;tranger to that manner of expre&s;&s;ion &s;o common in all times and in all countries, of being &s;oftened, re|laxed, enervated, di&s;&s;olved, melted away by plea|&s;ure? The univer&s;al voice of mankind, faithful to their feelings, concurs in affirming this uniform and general effect: and although &s;ome odd and particular in&s;tance may perhaps be found, wherein there ap|pears a con&s;iderable degree of po&s;itive plea&s;ure, without all the characters of relaxation, we mu&s;t not therefore reject the conclu&s;ion we had drawn from a concurrence of many experiments; but we mu&s;t &s;till retain it, &s;ubjoining the exceptions which may occur according to the judicious rule laid down by Sir I&s;aac Newton in the third book of his Optics. Our po&s;ition will, I conceive, appear confirmed beyond any rea&s;onable doubt, if we can &s;hew that &s;uch things as we have already ob&s;erved to be the ge|nuine con&s;tituents of beauty, have each of them, &s;eparately taken, a natural tendency to relax the fibres. And if it mu&s;t be allowed us, that the ap|pearance of the human body, when all the&s;e con|&s;tituents
<PB N="186" REF="12">
are united together before the &s;en&s;ory, fur ther favours this opinion, we may venture, I believe, to conclude, that the pa&s;&s;ion called love is produced by this relaxation. By the &s;ame method of rea&s;on|ing which we have u&s;ed in the enquiry into the cau&s;es of the &s;ublime, we may likewi&s;e conclude, that as a beautiful object pre&s;ented to the &s;en&s;e, by cau&s;ing a relaxation in the body, produces the pa&s;|&s;ion of love in the mind; &s;o if by any means the pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould fir&s;t have its origin in the mind, a re|laxation of the outward organs will as certainly en|&s;ue in a degree proportioned to the cau&s;e.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Sublime and Beautiful.</HI></BIBL></P>

Which &s;hews that beauty, and the pa&s;&s;ion cau&s;ed by beauty, which I call love, is different from de&s;ire, though de&s;ire may &s;ometimes operate along with it; but it is to this latter that we mu&s;t attribute tho&s;e violent and tempe&s;tuous pa&s;&s;ions, and the con&s;equent emotions of the body which at|tend what is called love in &s;ome of its ordinary ac|ceptations, and not to the effects of beauty merely as it is &s;uch.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>LANGUAGE. Effects of outrageous Language. (See AMERICA.)</HEAD>
<P>THIS outrageous language, <HI>(relative to America)</HI> which has been encouraged and kept alive by every art, has already done incredible mi&s;chief. For a long time, even amid&s;t the de&s;olations of war, and the in&s;ults of ho&s;tile laws daily accumulated on one another; the American leaders &s;eem to have had the greate&s;t difficulty in bringing up their people to a declaration of total independence.

The tide of popular affection, which had &s;till &s;et towards the parent country, began immediately to turn; and to &s;low with great rapidity in a contrary cour&s;e. Far from concealing the&s;e wild declarations of enmity, the author of the celebrated pamphlet which prepared the minds of the people for independence, in&s;i&s;ts largely on the multitude and the &s;pirit of the&s;e ad|dre&s;&s;es; and he draws an argument from them, which (if the fact were as he &s;uppo&s;es) mu&s;t be irre|&s;i&s;tible. For I never knew a writer on the theory of government &s;o partial to authority, as not to allow, that the ho&s;tile mind of the rulers to their people, did fully ju&s;tify a change of government; nor can any rea&s;on whatever be given, why one people &s;hould voluntarily yield any degree of pre-eminence to another, but on a &s;uppo&s;ition of great affection and benevolence towards them. Unfortunately your ruler, tru&s;ting to other things, took no notice of this great principle of connexion. From the begin|ning of this affair, they have done all they could to alienate your minds from your own kindred; and if they could excite hatred enough in one of the parties towards the other, they &s;eemed to be of opinion that they had gone half the way towards reconciling the quarrel.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Letter to the Sheriffs of Bri&s;tol.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>LANDED PROPERTY. Always di&s;&s;olving into Individuality.</HEAD>
<P>THE very nature of a country life, the very nature of landed property, in all the occupations, and all the plea&s;ures they afford, render combination and arrangement (the &s;ole way of procuring and exerting influence) in a manner impo&s;&s;ible among&s;t country people. Combine them by all the art you can, and all the indu&s;try, they are always di&s;&s;olving into indi|viduality. Any thing in the nature of incorporation is almo&s;t impracticable among&s;t them. Hope, fear, alarm, jealou&s;y, the ephemerous tale that does its bu&s;ine&s;s and dies in a day; all the&s;e things, which are the reins and &s;purs by which leaders check or urge the minds of followers, are not ea&s;ily employed, or hardly at all, among&s;t &s;cattered people. They a&s;|&s;emble, they arm, they act with the utmo&s;t difficulty, and at the greate&s;t charge. Their efforts, if ever they can be commenced, cannot be &s;u&s;tained. They cannot proceed &s;y&s;tematically. If the country gen|tlemen attempt an influence through the mere income of their property, what is it to that of tho&s;e who have ten times their income to &s;ell, and who can ruin their property by bringing their plunder to meet it at market. If the landed man wi&s;hes to mortgage, he falls the value of his land, and rai&s;es the value of

It is obvious, that in the towns, all the things which con&s;pire again&s;t the country gentleman, combine in favour of the money manager and director. In towns combination is natural.

<HEAD>MINISTERS (FAVOURITES.) Effects of the Court Sy&s;tem (Favouriti&s;m) on our fo|reign Affairs, on the Policy of our Government with regard to our Dependencies, and on the anterior Oeconomy of the Commonwealth, with &s;ome Ob&s;er|vations on the grand Principle which fir&s;t recom|mended this Sy&s;tem at Court. (See KING'S MEN, CABINET (DOUBLE), POLICY.</HEAD>
<P>A PLAN of favouriti&s;m for our executory govern|ment is e&s;&s;entially at variance with the plan of our legi&s;lature. One great end, undoubtedly, of a mixed government like ours, compo&s;ed of monarchy, and of controuls, on the part of the higher people and the lower, is that the prince &s;hall not be able to vio|late the laws. This is u&s;eful, indeed, and funda|mental; but this, even at fir&s;t view, is no more than a negative advantage; an armour merely defen&s;ive. It is therefore next in order, and equal in import|ance, <HI>that the di&s;cretionary powers which are nece&s;&s;arily</HI>
<PB N="192" REF="18"><HI>ve&s;ted in the monarch, whether for the execution of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, or for the nomination to magi&s;tracy and office, or for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ing the affairs of peace and war, or for or|dering the revenue, &s;hould all be exerci&s;ed upon public principles and national grounds, and not on the likings or prejudices, the intrigues or policies, of a court.</HI>&mdash;This, I &s;aid, is equal in importance to the &s;ecuring a government according to law. The laws reach but a very little way.</P>
<P>Con&s;titute government how you plea&s;e, infinitely the greater part of it mu&s;t depend upon the exer|ci&s;e of the powers which are left at large to the prudence and uprightne&s;s of mini&s;ters of &s;tate. Even all the u&s;e and potency of the laws depends upon them. Without them, your commonwealth is no better than a &s;cheme upon paper; and not a living, acting, effective con&s;titution. It is po&s;&s;ible, that through negligence, or ignorance, or de&s;ign artfully conducted, mini&s;ters may &s;uffer one part of govern|ment to langui&s;h, another to be perverted from its purpo&s;es, and every valuable intere&s;t of the country to fall into ruin and decay, without po&s;&s;ibility of fixing any &s;ingle act on which a criminal pro&s;ecution can be ju&s;tly grounded. The due arrangement of men in the active part of the &s;tate, far from being foreign to the purpo&s;es of a wi&s;e government, ought to be among its very fir&s;t and deare&s;t objects. When, therefore, the abettors of the new &s;y&s;tem tell us, that between them and their oppo&s;ers there is nothing but a &s;truggle for power, and that therefore we are no ways concerned in it; we mu&s;t tell tho&s;e who have the impudence to in&s;ult us in this manner, that of all things we ought to be the mo&s;t concerned, who and what &s;ort of men they are, that hold the tru&s;t of every thing that is dear to us. Nothing can render this a point of indifference to the nation, but what mu&s;t either render us totally de&s;perate, or &s;oothe us into the &s;ecurity of ideots. We mu&s;t &s;often into a credulity below the milkine&s;s of infancy, to think all men virtuous. We mu&s;t be tainted with a
<PB N="193" REF="19">
malignity truly diabolical, to believe all the world to be equally wicked and corrupt. Men are in public life as in private, &s;ome good, &s;ome evil. The elevation of the one, and the depre&s;&s;ion of the other, are the fir&s;t objects of all true policy. But that form of government, which, neither in its direct in&s;titu|tions, nor in their immediate tendency, has contrived to throw its affairs into the mo&s;t tru&s;t worthy hands, but has left its whole executory &s;y&s;tem to be di&s;po&s;ed of agreeably to the uncontrouled plea&s;ure of any one man, however excellent or virtuous, is a plan of polity defective not only in that member, but con|&s;equentially erroneous in every part of it.</P>
<P>In arbitrary governments, the con&s;titution of the mini&s;try follows the con&s;titution of the legi&s;lature. Both the law and the magi&s;trate are the creatures of will. It mu&s;t be &s;o. Nothing, indeed, will appear more certain, on any tolerable con&s;ideration of this matter, than that <HI>every &s;ort of government ought to have its admini&s;tration corre&s;pondent to its legi&s;lature.</HI> If it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, things mu&s;t fall into an hideous di&s;order. The people of a free common|wealth, who have taken &s;uch care that their laws &s;hould be the re&s;ult of general con&s;ent, cannot be &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s as to &s;uffer their executory &s;y&s;tem to be compo&s;ed of per&s;ons on whom they have no de|pendance, and whom no proofs of the public love and confidence have recommended to tho&s;e powers, upon the u&s;e of which the very being of the &s;tate depends.</P>
<P>The popular election of magi&s;trates, and popular di&s;po&s;ition of rewards and honours, is one of the fir&s;t advantages of a free &s;tate. Without it, or &s;omething equivalent to it, perhaps the people can|not long enjoy the &s;ub&s;tance of freedom; certainly none of the vivifying energy of good government. The frame of our commonwealth did not admit of &s;uch an actual election: but it provided as well, and (while the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution is pre&s;erved)
<PB N="194" REF="20">
better for all the effects of it than by the method of &s;uffrage in any democratic &s;tate what&s;oever. It had always, until of late, been held the fir&s;t duty of Parliament, <HI>to refu&s;e to &s;upport Government, until power was in the hands of per&s;ons who were acceptable to the people, or while factions predominated in the Court in which the nation had no confidence.</HI> Thus all the good effects of popular election were &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;e|cured to us, without the mi&s;chiefs attending on per|petual intrigue, and a di&s;tinct canva&s;s for every par|ticular office throughout the body of the people. This was the mo&s;t noble and refined part of our con|&s;titution. The people, by their repre&s;entatives and grandees, were intru&s;ted with a deliberative power in making laws; the king with the controul of his negative. The king was intru&s;ted with the delibe|rative choice and the election to office; the people had the negative in a parliamentary refu&s;al to &s;upport. Formerly this power of controul was what kept mini&s;ters in awe of parliaments, and parliaments in reverence with the people. If the u&s;e of this power of controul on the &s;y&s;tem and per&s;ons of admini|&s;tration is gone, every thing is lo&s;t, parliament and all. We may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, that if parliament will tamely &s;ee evil men take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the &s;trong holds of their country, and allow them time and means to fortify them&s;elves, under a pretence of giving them a fair trial, and upon a hope of di&s;cover|ing, whether they will not be reformed by power, and whether their mea&s;ures will not be better than their morals; &s;uch a parliament will give countenance to their mea&s;ures al&s;o, whatever that parliament may pretend, and whatever tho&s;e mea&s;ures may be.</P>
<P>Every good political in&s;titution mu&s;t have a pre|ventive operation as well as a remedial. It ought to have a natural tendency to exclude bad men from government, and not to tru&s;t for the &s;afety of the &s;tate to &s;ub&s;equent puni&s;hment alone: puni&s;hment, which has ever been tardy and uncertain; and which,
<PB N="195" REF="21">
when power is &s;uffered in bad hands, may chance to fall rather on the injured than the criminal.</P>
<P>Before men are put forward into the great tru&s;ts of the &s;tate, they ought by their conduct to have ob|tained &s;uch a degree of e&s;timation in their country, as may be &s;ome &s;ort of pledge and &s;ecurity to the public, that they will not abu&s;e tho&s;e tru&s;ts. It is no mean &s;ecurity for a proper u&s;e of power, that a man has &s;hewn by the general tenor of his actions, that the affection, the good opinion, the confidence, of his fellow citizens have been among the principal objects of his life; and that he has owed none of the gradations of his power or fortune to a &s;ettled con|tempt, or occa&s;ional forfeiture of their e&s;teem.</P>
<P>That man who before he comes into power has no friends, or who coming into power is obliged to de&s;ert his friends, or who lo&s;ing it has no friends to &s;ym|pathize with him; he who has no &s;way among any part of the landed or commercial intere&s;t, but who&s;e whole importance has begun with his office, and is &s;ure to end with it; is a per&s;on who ought never to be &s;uffered by a controuling parliament to continue in any of tho&s;e &s;ituations which confer the lead and direction of all our public affairs; becau&s;e &s;uch a man <HI>has no connexion with the intere&s;t of the people.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e knots or cabals of men who have got toge|ther, avowedly without any public principle, in order to &s;ell their conjunct iniquity at the higher rate, and are therefore univer&s;ally odious, ought never to be &s;uffered to domineer in the &s;tate; be|cau&s;e they have <HI>no connexion with the &s;entiments and opinions of the people.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are con&s;iderations which in my opinion enforce the nece&s;&s;ity of having &s;ome better rea&s;on, in a free country, and a free parliament, for &s;up|porting the mini&s;ters of the crown, than that &s;hort one, <HI>That the king has thought proper to appoint them.</HI> There is &s;omething very courtly in this. But it is a principle pregnant with all &s;orts of mi&s;chief, in a
<PB N="196" REF="22">
con&s;titution like ours, to turn the views of active men from the country to the court. Whatever be the road to power, that is the road which will be trod. If the opinion of the country be of no u&s;e as a means of power or con&s;ideration, the qualities which u&s;ually procure that opinion will be no longer cultivated. And whether it will be right, in a &s;tate &s;o popular in its con&s;titution as ours, to leave ambi|tion without popular motives, and to tru&s;t all to the operation of pure virtue in the minds of kings and mini&s;ters, and public men, mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to the judgment and good &s;en&s;e of the people of England.</P>
<P>Cunning men are here apt to break in, and, with|out directly controverting the principle, to rai&s;e ob|jections from the difficulty under which the &s;overeign labours to di&s;tingui&s;h the genuine voice and &s;enti|ments of his people, from the clamour of a faction, by which it is &s;o ea&s;ily counterfeited. The nation, they &s;ay, is generally divided into parties, with views and pa&s;&s;ions utterly irreconcileable. If the king &s;hould put his affairs into the hands of any one of them, he is &s;ure to di&s;gu&s;t the re&s;t; if he &s;elect par|ticular men from among them all, it is an hazard that he di&s;gu&s;ts them all. Tho&s;e who are left out, however divided before, will &s;oon run into a body of oppo&s;ition; which, being a collection of many di&s;contents into one focus, will without doubt be hot and violent enough. Faction will make its cries re&s;ound through the nation, as if the whole were in an uproar, when by far the majority, and much the better part, will &s;eem for a while as it were annihi|lated by the quiet in which their virtue and modera|tion incline them to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of govern|ment. Be&s;ides that the opinion of the mere vulgar is a mi&s;erable rule even with regard to them&s;elves, on account of their violence and in&s;tability. So that if you were to gratify them in their humour to|day, that very gratification would be a ground of their di&s;&s;atisfaction on the next. Now as all the&s;e
<PB N="197" REF="23">
rules of public opinion are to be collected with great difficulty, and to be applied with equal uncer|tainty as to the effect, what better can a king of England do, than to employ &s;uch men as he finds to have views and inclinations mo&s;t conformable to his own; who are lea&s;t infected with pride and &s;elf will, and who are lea&s;t moved by &s;uch popular humours as are perpetually traver&s;ing his de&s;igns, and di&s;turb|ing his &s;ervice; tru&s;ting that, when he means no ill to his people, he will be &s;upported in his appoint|ments, whether he choo&s;es to keep or to change, as his private judgment or his plea&s;ure leads him? He will find a &s;ure re&s;ource in the real weight and in|fluence of the crown, when it is not &s;uffered to be|come an in&s;trument in the hands of a faction.</P>
<P>I will not pretend to &s;ay that there is nothing at all in this mode of rea&s;oning; becau&s;e I will not a&s;&s;ert that there is no difficulty in the art of govern|ment. Undoubtedly the very be&s;t admini&s;tration mu&s;t encounter a great deal of oppo&s;ition; and the very wor&s;t will find more &s;upport than it de&s;erves. Sufficient appearances will never be wanting to tho&s;e who have a mind to deceive them&s;elves. It is a fallacy in con&s;tant u&s;e with tho&s;e who would level all things, and confound right with wrong, to in&s;i&s;t upon the inconveniencies which are attached to every choice, without taking into con&s;ideration the diffe|rent weight and con&s;equence of tho&s;e inconvenien|cies. The que&s;tion is not concerning <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> di&s;|content or <HI>perfect</HI> &s;atisfaction in government; nei|ther of which can be pure and unmixed at any time, or upon any &s;y&s;tem. The controver&s;y is about that degree of good humour in the people, which may po&s;&s;ibly be attained, and ought certainly to be looked for. While &s;ome politicians may be waiting to know whether the &s;en&s;e of every individual be again&s;t them, accurately di&s;tingui&s;hing the vulgar from the better &s;ort, drawing lines between the enterprizes of a faction and the efforts of a people, they may chance
<PB N="198" REF="24">
to &s;ee the government, which they are &s;o nicely weighing and dividing, and di&s;tingui&s;hing, tumble to the ground in the mid&s;t of their wi&s;e deliberation. Prudent men, when &s;o great an object as the &s;ecurity of government, or even its peace, is at &s;take, will not run the ri&s;k of a deci&s;ion which may be fatal to it. They who can read the political &s;ky will &s;ee an hurricane in a cloud no bigger than an hand at the very edge of the horizon, and will run into the fir&s;t harbour. No lines can be laid down for civil or political wi&s;dom. They are a matter incapable of exact definition. But, though no man can draw a &s;troke between the confines of day and night, yet light and darkne&s;s are upon the whole tolerably di&s;|tingui&s;hable. Nor will it be impo&s;&s;ible for a prince to find out &s;uch a mode of government, and &s;uch per&s;ons to admini&s;ter it, as will give a great degree of content to his people; without any curious and anxious re&s;earch for that ab&s;tract, univer&s;al, perfect harmony, which while he is &s;eeking, he abandons tho&s;e means of ordinary tranquillity which are in his power without any re&s;earch at all.</P>
<P>It is not more the duty than it is the intere&s;t of a prince, to aim at giving tranquillity to his govern|ment. But tho&s;e who advi&s;e him may have an in|tere&s;t in di&s;order and confu&s;ion.

<HEAD>MINISTERS. Character of the interior Mini&s;try, (See CABINET (DOUBLE.)</HEAD>
<P>THE interior mini&s;try are &s;en&s;ible, that war is a &s;ituation which &s;ets in its full light the value of the hearts of a people; and they well know, that the be|ginning of the importance of the people mu&s;t be the end of theirs.

I do not mean that they manife&s;t any of that pious fear which is backward to commit the &s;afety of the country to the dubious experiment of war. Such a fear, being the tender &s;en&s;ation of virtue, excited, as it is regu|lated, by rea&s;on, frequently &s;hews it&s;elf in a &s;ea&s;on|able boldne&s;s, which keeps danger at a di&s;tance, by &s;eeming to de&s;pi&s;e it. Their fear betrays to the fir&s;t glance of the eye, its true cau&s;e, and its real object. Foreign powers, confident in the knowledge of their character, have not &s;crupled to violate the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn treaties; and, in defiance of them, to make conque&s;ts in the mid&s;t of a general peace, and in the heart of Europe. Such was the conque&s;t of Cor&s;ica, by the profe&s;&s;ed enemies of the freedom of mankind, in defiance of tho&s;e who were formerly its profe&s;&s;ed defenders. We have had ju&s;t claims upon the &s;ame powers; rights which ought to have been &s;acred to them as well as to us, as they had their origin in our lenity and genero&s;ity towards France and Spain in the day of their great humiliation. Such I call the ran|&s;om of Manilla, and the demand on France for the Ea&s;t India pri&s;oners. But the&s;e powers put a ju&s;t confidence in their re&s;ource of the <HI>double cabinet.</HI> The&s;e demands (one of them at lea&s;t) are ha&s;tening fa&s;t towards an acquittal by pre&s;cription. Oblivion begins to &s;pread her cobwebs over all our &s;pirited remon&s;trances. Some of the mo&s;t valuable branches of our trade are al&s;o on the point of peri&s;hing from
<PB N="200" REF="26">
the &s;ame cau&s;e. I do not mean tho&s;e branches which bear without the hand of the vine-dre&s;&s;er; I mean tho&s;e which the policy of treaties had formerly &s;e|cured to us; I mean to mark and di&s;tingui&s;h the trade of Portugal, the lo&s;s of which, and the power of the cabal, have one and the &s;ame aera.</P>
<P>If, by any chance, the mini&s;ters who &s;tand before the curtain po&s;&s;e&s;s or affect any &s;pirit, it makes little or no impre&s;&s;ion. Foreign courts and mini&s;ters, who were among the fir&s;t to di&s;cover and to profit by this invention of the <HI>double cabinet,</HI> attend very little to their remon&s;trances. They know that tho&s;e &s;hadows of mini&s;ters have nothing to do in the ultimate di&s;|po&s;al of things. Jealou&s;ies and animo&s;ities are &s;edu|lou&s;ly nouri&s;hed in the outward admini&s;tration, and have been even con&s;idered as a <HI>cau&s;a &s;ine qua non</HI> in its con&s;titution: thence foreign courts have a cer|tainty, that nothing can be done by common coun&s;el in this nation. If one of tho&s;e mini&s;ters officially takes up a bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;pirit, it &s;erves only the better to &s;ignalize the meanne&s;s of the re&s;t, and the di&s;cord of them all. His colleagues in office are in ha&s;te to &s;hake him off, and to di&s;claim the whole of his proceedings. Of this nature was that a&s;toni&s;hing tran&s;action, in which Lord Rochford, our amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, remon&s;trated again&s;t the attempt upon Cor|&s;ica, in con&s;equence of a direct authority from Lord Shelburne. This remon&s;trance the French mini&s;ter treated with the contempt that was natural; as he was a&s;&s;ured, from the amba&s;&s;ador of his court to ours, that the&s;e orders of Lord Shelburne were not &s;up|ported by the re&s;t of the (I had like to have &s;aid Briti&s;h) admini&s;tration. Lord Rochford, a man of &s;pirit, could not endure this &s;ituation. The con&s;e|quences were, however, curious. He returns from Paris, and comes home full of anger. Lord Shel|burne, who gave the orders, is obliged to give up the &s;eals. Lord Rochford, who obeyed the&s;e orders, receives them. He goes, however, into another
<PB N="201" REF="27">
department of the &s;ame office, that he might not be obliged officially to acquie&s;ce in one &s;ituation under what he had officially remon&s;trated again&s;t in another. At Paris, the Duke of Choi&s;cul con&s;idered this office arrangement as a compliment to him: here it was &s;poke of as an attention to the delicacy of Lord Rochford. But whether the compliment was to one or both, to this nation it was the &s;ame. By this tran&s;action the condition of our court lay expo&s;ed in all its nakedne&s;s. Our office corre&s;pondence has lo&s;t all pretence to authenticity; Briti&s;h policy is brought into deri&s;ion in tho&s;e nations, that a while ago trembled at the power of our arms, whil&s;t they looked up with confidence to the equity, firmne&s;s, and candour, which &s;hone in all our negotiations. I repre&s;ent this matter exactly in the light in which it has been univer&s;ally received.</P>
<P>Such has been the a&s;pect of our foreign politics, under the influence of a <HI>double cabinet.</HI> With &s;uch an arrangement at court, it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould have been otherwi&s;e. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible that this &s;cheme &s;hould have a better effect upon the govern|ment of our dependencies, the fir&s;t, the deare&s;t, and mo&s;t delicate objects, of the interior policy of this empire. The colonies know, that admini&s;tration is &s;eparated from the court, divided within it&s;elf, and dete&s;ted by the nation. The <HI>double cabinet</HI> has, in both the parts of it, &s;hewn the mo&s;t malignant di&s;po|&s;itions towards them, without being able to do them the &s;malle&s;t mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>They are convinced, by &s;ufficient experience, that no plan, either of lenity or rigour, can be pur|&s;ued with uniformity and per&s;everance. Therefore they turn their eyes entirely from Great Britain, where they have neither dependence on friend&s;hip, nor apprehen&s;ion from enmity. They look to them|&s;elves, and their own arrangements. They grow every day into alienation from this country; and whil&s;t they are becoming di&s;connected with our go|vernment,
<PB N="202" REF="28">
we have not the con&s;olation to find, that they are even friendly in their new independence. Nothing can equal the futility, the weakne&s;s, the ra&s;hne&s;s, the timidity, the perpetual contradiction, in the management of our affairs in that part of the world. A volume might be written on this melan|choly &s;ubject; but it were better to leave it entirely to the reflexions of the reader him&s;elf than not to treat it in the extent it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>In what manner our dome&s;tic oeconomy is affected by this &s;y&s;tem, it is needle&s;s to explain. It is the perpetual &s;ubject of their own complaints.</P>
<P>The court party re&s;olve the whole into faction. Having &s;aid &s;omething before upon this &s;ubject, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve here, that when they give this account of the prevalence of faction, they pre&s;ent no very favourable a&s;pect of the confidence of the people in their own government. They may be a&s;&s;ured, that however they amu&s;e them&s;elves with a variety of projects for &s;ub&s;tituting &s;omething el&s;e in the place of that great and only foundation of go|vernment, the confidence of the people, every attempt will but make their condition wor&s;e. When men imagine that their food is only a cover for poi&s;on, and when they neither love nor tru&s;t the hand that &s;erves it, it is not the name of the roa&s;t beef of Old England, that will per&s;uade them to &s;it down to the table that is &s;pread for them. When the people conceive that laws, and tribunals, and even popular a&s;&s;emblies, are perverted from the ends of their in&s;titution, they find in tho&s;e names of degenerated e&s;tabli&s;hments only new motives to di&s;content. Tho&s;e bodies, which, when full of life and beauty, lay in their arms, and were their joy and comfort, when dead and putrid, become but the more loath&s;ome from remembrance of former endearments. A &s;ullen gloom, and furious di&s;order, prevail by fits; the nation lo&s;es its reli&s;h for peace and pro&s;perity, as it did in that &s;ea&s;on of fullne&s;s
<PB N="203" REF="29">
which opened our troubles in the time of Charles the Fir&s;t. A &s;pecies of men to whom a &s;tate of order would become a &s;entence of ob&s;curity, are nouri&s;hed into a dangerous magnitude by the heat of inte&s;tine di&s;turbances; and it is no wonder that, by a &s;ort of &s;ini&s;ter piety, they cheri&s;h, in their turn, the di&s;|orders which are the parents of all their con&s;equence. Superficial ob&s;ervers con&s;ider &s;uch per&s;ons as the cau&s;e of the public unea&s;ine&s;s, when, in truth, they are nothing more than the effect of it. Good men look upon this di&s;tracted &s;cene with &s;orrow and in|dignation. Their hands are tied behind them. They are de&s;poiled of all the power which might enable them to reconcile the &s;trength of government with the rights of the people. They &s;tand in a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing alternative. But in the election among evils they hope better things from temporary con|fu&s;ion, than from e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ervitude. In the mean time, the voice of law is not to be heard. Fierce licentiou&s;ne&s;s begets violent re&s;traints. The military arm is the &s;ole reliance; and then, call your con&s;titution what you plea&s;e, it is the &s;word that governs. The civil power, like every other that calls in the aid of an ally &s;tronger than it&s;elf, peri&s;hes by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance it recieves. But the contrivers of this &s;cheme of government will not tru&s;t &s;olely to the military power; becau&s;e they are cunning men. Their re&s;tle&s;s and crooked &s;pirit drives them to rake in the dirt of every kind of expedient. Unable to rule the multitude, they endeavour to rai&s;e divi&s;ions among&s;t them. One mob is hired to de&s;troy another; a procedure which at once encourages the boldne&s;s of the populace, and ju&s;tly increa&s;es their di&s;content. Men become pen&s;ioners of &s;tate on account of their abilities in the array of riot, and the di&s;cipline of confu&s;ion. Government is put under the di&s;graceful nece&s;&s;ity of protecting from the &s;everity of the laws that very licentiou&s;ne&s;s, which the laws had been before violated to repre&s;s. Every thing partakes of
<PB N="204" REF="30">
the original di&s;order. Anarchy predominates without freedom, and &s;ervitude without &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion or &s;ubor|dination. The&s;e are the con&s;equences inevitable to our public peace, from the &s;cheme of rendering the executory government at once odious and feeble; of freeing admini&s;tration from the con&s;titutional and &s;alutary controul of parliament, and inventing for it a <HI>new controul,</HI> unknown to the con&s;titution, an <HI>interior cabinet;</HI> which brings the whole body of government into confu&s;ion and contempt.</P>
<P>After having &s;tated, as &s;hortly as I am able, the effects of this &s;y&s;tem on our foreign affairs, on the policy of our government with regard to our depen|dencies, and on the interior oeconomy of the com|monwealth; there remains only, in this part of my de&s;ign, to &s;ay &s;omething of the grand principle which fir&s;t recommended this &s;y&s;tem at court. The pretence was, to prevent the king from being en&s;laved by a faction, and made a pri&s;oner in his clo&s;et. This &s;cheme might have been expected to an&s;wer at lea&s;t its own end, and to indemnify the king, in his per|&s;onal capacity, for all the confu&s;ion into which it has thrown his government. But has it in reality an&s;wered this purpo&s;e? I am &s;ure, if it had, every affectionate &s;ubject would have one motive for endur|ing with patience all the evils which attend it.</P>
<P>In order to come at the truth in this matter, it may not be ami&s;s to con&s;ider it &s;omewhat in detail. I &s;peak here of the king, and not of the crown; the intere&s;ts of which we have already touched. Inde|pendent of that greatne&s;s which a king po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es merely by being a repre&s;entative of the national dig|nity, the things in which he may have an individual intere&s;t &s;eem to be the&s;e: wealth accumulated; wealth &s;pent in magnificence, plea&s;ure, or beneficence; per|&s;onal re&s;pect and attention; and above all, private ea&s;e and repo&s;e of mind. The&s;e compo&s;e the in|ventory of pro&s;perous circum&s;tances, whether they regard a prince or a &s;ubject; their enjoyments differ|ing only in the &s;cales upon which they are formed.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="31">Suppo&s;e then we were to a&s;k, whether the king has been richer than his predece&s;&s;ors in accumu|lated wealth, &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the plan of favouriti&s;m? I believe it will be found that the pic|ture of royal indigence which our court has pre|&s;ented until this year, has been truly humiliating. Nor has it been relieved from this un&s;eemly di&s;tre&s;s, but by means which have hazarded the affection of the people, and &s;haken their confidence in parlia|ment. If the public trea&s;ures had been exhau&s;ted in magnificence and &s;plendour, this di&s;tre&s;s would have been accounted for, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure ju&s;tified. Nothing would be more unworthy of this nation, than with a mean and mechanical rule, to mete out the &s;plendour of the crown. Indeed I have found very few per&s;ons di&s;po&s;ed to &s;o ungenerous a pro|cedure. But the generality of people, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, do feel a good deal mortified, when they compare the wants of the court with its expences. They do not behold the cau&s;e of this di&s;tre&s;s in any part of the apparatus of royal magnificence. In all this, they &s;ee nothing but the operations of par&s;i|mony, attended with all the con&s;equences of profu|&s;ion. Nothing expended, nothing &s;aved. Their wonder is encrea&s;ed by their knowledge, that be&s;ides the revenue &s;ettled on his maje&s;ty's civil li&s;t to the amount of 800,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year, he has a farther aid, from a large pen&s;ion li&s;t, near 90,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year, in Ireland; from the produce of the dutchy of Lan|ca&s;ter (which we are told has been greatly improved); from the revenue of the dutchy of Cornwall; from the American quit-rents; from the four and a half <HI>per cent.</HI> duty in the Leeward I&s;lands; this la&s;t worth to be &s;ure con&s;iderably more than 40,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year. The whole is certainly not much &s;hort of a million annually.</P>
<P>The&s;e are revenues within the knowledge and cognizance of our national councils. We have no direct right to examine into the receipts from his
<PB N="206" REF="32">
maje&s;ty's German dominions, and the bi&s;hopric of O&s;nabrug. This is unque&s;tionably true. But that which is not within the province of parliament, is yet within the &s;phere of every man's own reflexion. If a foreign prince re&s;ided among&s;t us, the &s;tate of his revenues could not fail of becoming the &s;ubject of our &s;peculation. Filled with an anxious concern for whatever regards the welfare of our &s;overeign, it is impo&s;&s;ible, in con&s;idering the mi&s;erable circum&s;tances into which he has been brought, that this obvious topic &s;hould be entirely pa&s;&s;ed over. There is an opinion univer&s;al, that the&s;e revenues produce &s;ome|thing not incon&s;iderable, clear of all charges and e&s;tabli&s;hments. This produce the people do not be|lieve to be hoarded, nor perceive to be &s;pent. It is accounted for in the only manner it can, by &s;uppo&s;ing that it is drawn away, for the &s;upport of that court faction, which, whil&s;t it di&s;tre&s;&s;es the nation, impo|veri&s;hes the prince in every one of his re&s;ources. I once more caution the reader, that I do not urge this con&s;ideration concerning the foreign revenue, as if I &s;uppo&s;ed we had a direct right to examine into the ex|penditure of any part of it; but &s;olely for the pur|po&s;e of &s;hewing how little this &s;y&s;tem of favouriti&s;m has been advantageous to the monarch him&s;elf; which, without magnificence, has &s;unk him into a &s;tate of unnatural poverty; at the &s;ame time that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every means of affluence, from ample re|venues, both in this country, and in other parts of his dominions.</P>
<P>Has this &s;y&s;tem provided better for the treatment becoming his high and &s;acred character, and &s;ecured the king from tho&s;e di&s;gu&s;ts attached to the nece&s;&s;ity of employing men who are not per&s;onally agreeable? This is a topic upon which for many rea&s;ons I could wi&s;h to be &s;ilent; but the pretence of &s;ecuring again&s;t &s;uch cau&s;es of unea&s;ine&s;s, is the corner-&s;tone of the court party. It has, however, &s;o happened, that if I were to fix upon any one point, in which this &s;y&s;|tem
<PB N="207" REF="33">
has been more particularly and &s;hamefully blame|able, the effects which it has produced would ju&s;tify me in choo&s;ing for that point its tendency to degrade the per&s;onal dignity of the &s;overeign, and to expo&s;e him to a thou&s;and contradictions and mortifications. It is but too evident in what manner the&s;e projectors of royal greatne&s;s have fulfilled all their magnificent promi&s;es. Without recapitulating all the circum|&s;tances of the reign, every one of which is more or le&s;s a melancholy proof of the truth of what I have advanced, let us con&s;ider the language of the court but a few years ago, concerning mo&s;t of the per&s;ons now in the external admini&s;tration: let me a&s;k, whether any enemy to the per&s;onal feelings of the &s;overeign, could po&s;&s;ibly contrive a keener in&s;tru|ment of mortification, and degradation of all dig|nity, than almo&s;t every part and member of the pre|&s;ent arrangement? nor, in the whole cour&s;e of our hi&s;tory, has any compliance with the will of the peo|ple ever been known to extort from any prince a greater contradiction to all his own declared affecti|ons and di&s;likes than that which is now adopted, in direct oppo&s;ition to every thing the people approve and de&s;ire.</P>
<P>An opinion prevails, that greatne&s;s has been more than once advi&s;ed to &s;ubmit to certain conde&s;cen|&s;ions towards individuals, which have been denied to the entreaties of a nation. For the meane&s;t and mo&s;t dependent in&s;trument of this &s;y&s;tem knows, that there are hours when its exi&s;tence may depend upon his adherence to it; and he takes his advantage accordingly. Indeed it is a law of nature, that whoever is nece&s;&s;ary to what we have made our ob|ject, is &s;ure, in &s;ome way, or in &s;ome time or other, to become our ma&s;ter. All this, however, is &s;ub|mitted to, in order to avoid that mon&s;trous evil of governing in concurrence with the opinion of the people. For it &s;eems to be laid down as a maxim,
<PB N="208" REF="34">
that a king has &s;ome &s;ort of intere&s;t in giving un|ea&s;ine&s;s to his &s;ubjects: that all who are plea&s;ing to them, are to be of cour&s;e di&s;agreeable to him: that as &s;oon as the per&s;ons who are odious at court are known to be odious to the people, it is &s;natched at as a lucky occa&s;ion of &s;howering down upon them all kinds of emoluments and honours. None are con&s;idered as well-wi&s;hers to the crown, but tho&s;e who advi&s;e to &s;ome unpopular cour&s;e of action; none capable of &s;erving it, but tho&s;e who are obliged to call at every in&s;tant upon all its power for the &s;afety of their lives. None are &s;uppo&s;ed to be fit prie&s;ts in the temple of government, but the per&s;ons who are compelled to fly into it for &s;anctuary. Such is the effect of this refined project; &s;uch is ever the re&s;ult of all the contrivances which are u&s;ed to free men from the &s;ervitude of their rea&s;on, and from the nece&s;&s;ity of ordering their affairs according to their evident intere&s;ts. The&s;e contrivances oblige them to run into a real and ruinous &s;ervitude, in order to avoid a &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;traint that might be attended with advantage.</P>
<P>If, therefore, this &s;y&s;tem has &s;o ill an&s;wered its own grand pretence of &s;aving the king from the nece&s;&s;ity of employing per&s;ons di&s;agreeable to him, has it given more peace and tranquillity to his maje&s;ty's private hours? No, mo&s;t certainly. The father of his people cannot po&s;&s;ibly enjoy repo&s;e, while his family is in &s;uch a &s;tate of di&s;traction. Then what has the crown or the king profitted by all this fine-wrought &s;cheme? Is he more rich, or more &s;plendid, or more powerful, or more at his ea&s;e, by &s;o many labours and contrivances? Have they not beggared his exchequer, tarni&s;hed the &s;plen|dour of his court, &s;unk his dignity, galled his feel|ings, di&s;compo&s;ed the whole order and happine&s;s of his private life.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Thoughts on the Cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent Di&s;contents.</HI></BIBL></P>

<P>MANNERS are of more importance than laws. In a great mea&s;ure the laws depend upon them. The law touches us but here and there, and now and then. Manners are what vex or &s;ooth, corrupt or purify, exalt or deba&s;e, barbarize or refine us, by a con&s;tant, &s;teady, uniform, in&s;en&s;ible operation, like that of the air we breathe in. They give their whole form and colour to our lives. According to their quality, they aid morals, they &s;upply them, or they totally de&s;troy them. Of this the new French Legi&s;lators were aware; therefore, with the &s;ame method, and under the &s;ame authority, they &s;ettled a &s;y&s;tem of manners, the mo&s;t licentious, pro&s;titute, and abandoned, and, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t coar&s;e, rude, &s;avage, and &s;erocious. Nothing in the Revolution, no, not to a phra&s;e or a ge&s;ture, not to the fa&s;hion of a hat or a &s;hoe, was left to accident. All was the re&s;ult of de&s;ign; all was matter of in&s;titu|tion. No mechanical means could be devi&s;ed in fa|vour of this incredible &s;y&s;tem of wickedne&s;s and vice, that has not been employed. The noble&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, the love of glory, the love of country, were debauched into means of it's pre&s;ervation and it's propagation. All &s;orts of &s;hews and exhibitions calculated to inflame and vitiate the imagination, and pervert the moral &s;en&s;e, have been contrived. They have &s;ometimes brought forth five or &s;ix hundred drunken women, calling at the bar of the A&s;&s;embly for the blood of their own children, as being royal|i&s;ts or con&s;titutionals. Sometimes they have got a body of wretches, calling them&s;elves fathers, to de|mand the murder of their &s;ons; boa&s;ting that Rome had but one Brutus, but that they could &s;hew five hundred.

<HEAD>MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>OTHER Legi&s;lators, knowing that marriage is the origin of all relations, and con&s;equently the fir&s;t element of all duties, have endeavoured, by every art, to make it &s;acred. The Chri&s;tian religion, by confining it to the pairs, and by rendering that rela|tion indi&s;&s;oluble, has, by the&s;e two things, done more towards the peace, happine&s;s, &s;ettlement, and civili|zation of the world, than by any other part in this whole &s;cheme of Divine Wi&s;dom. The direct con|trary cour&s;e was taken in the Synagogue of Anti|chri&s;t, I mean in that forge and manufactory of all

evil, the &s;ect which predominated in the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly of 1789. Tho&s;e mon&s;ters employed the &s;ame, or greater indu&s;try, to de&s;ecrate and degrade that State, which other Legi&s;lators have u&s;ed to ren|der it holy and honourable. By a &s;trange, uncalled for declaration, they pronounced, that marriage was no better than a common, civil contract. It was one of their ordinary tricks, to put their &s;entiments into the mouths of certain per&s;onated characters, which they theatrically exhibited at the bar of what ought to be a &s;erious A&s;&s;embly. One of the&s;e was brought out in the figure of a pro&s;titute, whom they called by the affected name of <Q REND="inline">"a mother without being a wife."</Q> This creature they made to call for a repeal of the incapacities, which in civilized States are put upon ba&s;tards. The pro&s;titutes of the A&s;|&s;embly gave to this their puppet, the &s;anction of their greater impudence. In con&s;equence of the principles laid down, and the manners authori&s;ed, ba&s;tards were not long after put on the footing of the i&s;&s;ue of lawful unions. Proceeding in the &s;pirit of the fir&s;t authors of their con&s;titution, they went the full length of the principle, and gave a licence to divorce at the mere plea&s;ure of either party, and at four day's notice. With them the matrimonial connexion was brought into &s;o degrading a &s;tate of concubinage, that, I believe, none of the wretches in London, who keep warehou&s;es of infamy, would give out one of their victims to private cu&s;tody on &s;o &s;hort and in&s;olent a tenure. There was, indeed, a kind of profligate equity in thus giving to women the &s;ame licentious power. The rea&s;on they a&s;&s;igned was as infamous as the act, declaring that women had been too long under the tyranny of parents and of hu&s;bands. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve upon the horrible con&s;equences of taking one half of the &s;pe|cies wholly out of the guardian&s;hip and protection of the other.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Regicide Peace.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>MONASTIC INSTITUTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are moments in the fortune of &s;tates when particular men are called to make improvements by great mental exertion. In tho&s;e moments, even when they &s;eem to enjoy the confidence of their prince and country, and to be inve&s;ted with full au|thority, they have not always apt in&s;truments. A politician, to do great things, looks for a <HI>power,</HI> what our workmen call a <HI>purcha&s;e;</HI> and if he finds that power, in politics as in mechanics, he cannot be at a lo&s;s to apply it. In the mona&s;tic in&s;titutions, in my opinion, was found a great <HI>power</HI> for the mechani&s;m of politic benevolence. There were revenues with a public direction; there were men wholly &s;et apart and dedicated to public purpo&s;es, without any other than public ties and public principles; men without the po&s;&s;ibility of converting the e&s;tate of the commu|nity into a private fortune; men denied to &s;elf-intere&s;ts, who&s;e avarice is for &s;ome community; men to whom per&s;onal poverty is honour, and im|plicit obedience &s;tands in the place of freedom. In vain &s;hall a man look to the po&s;&s;ibility of making &s;uch things when he wants them. The winds blow as they li&s;t. The&s;e in&s;titutions are the products of enthu&s;ia&s;m; they are the in&s;truments of wi&s;dom. Wi&s;dom cannot create materials; they are the gifts of nature or of chance; her pride is in the u&s;e. The perennial exi&s;tence of bodies corporate and their for|tunes, are things particularly &s;uited to a man who has long views; who meditates de&s;igns that require time in fa&s;hioning; and which propo&s;e duration when they are accompli&s;hed. He is not de&s;erving to rank high, or even to be mentioned in the order of great &s;tate&s;men, who, having obtained the command and direction of &s;uch a power as exi&s;ted in the wealth, the di&s;cipline, and the habits of &s;uch corporations, as tho&s;e which you have ra&s;hly de&s;troyed, cannot find any way of converting it to the great and la&s;ting
<PB N="214" REF="40">
benefit of his country. On the view of this &s;ubject a thou&s;and u&s;es &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves to a contriving mind. To de&s;troy any power, growing wild from the rank productive force of the human mind, is almo&s;t tantamount, in the moral world, to the de|&s;truction of the apparently active properties of bodies in the material. It would be like the attempt to de|&s;troy (if it were in our competence to de&s;troy) the expan&s;ive force of fixed air in nitre, or the power of &s;team, or of electricity, or of magneti&s;m. The&s;e energies always exi&s;ted in nature, and they were al|ways di&s;cernible. They &s;eemed, &s;ome of them un|&s;erviceable, &s;ome noxious, &s;ome no better than a &s;port to children; until contemplative ability, com|bining with practic &s;kill, tamed their wild nature, &s;ubdued them to u&s;e, and rendered them at once the mo&s;t powerful and the mo&s;t tractable agents, in &s;ub|&s;ervience to the great views and de&s;igns of men. Did fifty thou&s;and per&s;ons, who&s;e mental and who&s;e bodily labour you might direct, and &s;o many hun|dred thou&s;and a year of a revenue, which was nei|ther lazy nor &s;uper&s;titious, appear too big for your abilities to wield? Had you no way of u&s;ing the men but by converting monks into pen&s;ioners? Had you no way of turning the revenue to account, but through the improvident re&s;ource of a &s;pendthrift &s;ale? If you were thus de&s;titute of mental funds, the proceeding is in its natural cour&s;e. Your politicians do not under&s;tand their trade; and therefore they &s;ell their tools.</P>
<P>But the in&s;titutions favour of &s;uper&s;tition in their very principle; and they nouri&s;h it by a permanent and &s;tanding influence. This I do not mean to di&s;pute; but this ought not to hinder you from de|riving from &s;uper&s;tition it&s;elf any re&s;ources which may thence be furni&s;hed for the public advantage. You derive benefits from many di&s;po&s;itions and many pa&s;&s;ions of the human mind, which are of as doubtful a colour in the moral eye, as &s;uper&s;tition it&s;elf. It
<PB N="215" REF="41">
was your bu&s;ine&s;s to correct and mitigate every thing which was noxious in this pa&s;&s;ion, as in all the pa&s;|&s;ions. But is &s;uper&s;tition the greate&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible vices? In its po&s;&s;ible exce&s;s I think it becomes a very great evil. It is, however, a moral &s;ubject; and, of cour&s;e, admits of all degrees and all modifi|cations. Super&s;tition is the religion of feeble minds; and they mu&s;t be tolerated in an intermixture of it, in &s;ome trifling or &s;ome enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;hape or other, el&s;e you will deprive weak minds of a re&s;ource found nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;tronge&s;t. The body of all true religion con&s;i&s;ts, to be &s;ure, in obedience to the will of the &s;overeign of the world; in a confidence in his declarations; and an imitation of his perfections. The re&s;t is our own. It may be prejudicial to the great end; it may be auxiliary. Wi&s;e men, who as &s;uch, are not <HI>admirers</HI> (not admirers at lea&s;t of the <HI>Manera Terrae</HI>) are not violently attached to the&s;e things, nor do they violently hate them. Wi&s;dom is not the mo&s;t &s;evere corrector of folly. They are the rival follies, which mutually wage &s;o unrelenting a war; and which make &s;o cruel a u&s;e of their ad|vantages, as they can happen to engage the immo|derate vulgar on the one &s;ide or the other in their quarrels. Prudence would be neuter; but if, in the contention between fond attachment and fierce anti|pathy concerning things in their nature not made to produce &s;uch heats, a prudent man were obliged to make a choice of what errors and exce&s;&s;es of enthu|&s;ia&s;m he would condemn or bear, perhaps he would think the &s;uper&s;tition which builds, to be more toler|able than that which demoli&s;hes&mdash;that which adorns a country, than that which deforms it&mdash;that which endows, than that which plunders&mdash; that which di&s;|po&s;es to mi&s;taken beneficence, than that which &s;timu|lates to real inju&s;tice&mdash;that which leads a man to re|fu&s;e to him&s;elf lawful plea&s;ures, than that which &s;natches from others the &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of their &s;elf-denial.

<HEAD>MERCHANTS. Properties of Merchants applied to the Ea&s;t-India Company.</HEAD>
<P>THE principle of buying cheap and &s;elling dear is the fir&s;t, the great foundation of mercantile dealing.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="44">A great deal of &s;trictne&s;s in driving bargains for whatever we contract, is another of the principles of mercantile policy. Try the company by that te&s;t! Look at the contracts that are made for them. Is the company &s;o much as a good commi&s;&s;ary to their own armies? I engage to &s;elect for you, out of the innumerable ma&s;s of their dealings, all conducted very nearly alike, one contract only, the exce&s;&s;ive profits on which during a &s;hort term would pay the whole of their year's dividend. I &s;hall undertake to &s;hew, that upon two others, that the inordinate pro|fits given, with the lo&s;&s;es incurred in order to &s;ecure tho&s;e profits, would pay a year's dividend more.</P>
<P>It is a third property of trading men, to &s;ee that their clerks do not divert the dealings of the ma&s;ter to their own benefit. It was the other day only, when their governor and council taxed the company's inve&s;tment with a &s;um of fifty thou&s;and pounds, as an inducement to per&s;uade only &s;even members of their board of trade to give their <HI>honour</HI> that they would ab&s;tain from &s;uch profits upon that inve&s;tment as they mu&s;t have violated their <HI>oaths</HI> if they had made at all.</P>
<P>It is a fourth quality of a merchant to be exact in his accounts. What will be thought, when you have fully before you the mode of accounting made u&s;e of in the trea&s;ury of Bengal?&mdash;I hope you will have it &s;oon. With regard to one of their agencies, when it came to the material part, the prime co&s;t of the goods on which a commi&s;&s;ion of fifteen <HI>per cent.</HI> was allowed, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the factory to whom the commodities were &s;ent, the accountant-ge|neral reports that he did not think him&s;elf authorized to call for <HI>vouchers</HI> relative to this and other particu|lars&mdash;becau&s;e the agent was upon his <HI>honour</HI> with regard to them. A new principle of account upon honour &s;eems to be regularly e&s;tabli&s;hed in their dealings and their trea&s;ury, which in reality amounts
<PB N="219" REF="45">
to an entire annihilation of the principle of all ac|counts.</P>
<P>It is a fifth property of a merchant, who does not meditate a fraudulent bankruptcy, to calculate his probable profits upon the money he takes up to ve&s;t in bu&s;ine&s;s. Did the company, when they bought goods on bonds bearing 8 <HI>per cent.</HI> intere&s;t, at 10, and even 20 <HI>per cent.</HI> di&s;count, even a&s;k them&s;elves a que&s;tion concerning the po&s;&s;ibility of advantage from dealing on the&s;e terms?</P>
<P>The la&s;t quality of a merchant I &s;hall advert to, is the taking care to be properly prepared, in ca&s;h or goods, in the ordinary cour&s;e of &s;ale, for the bills which are drawn on them. Now I a&s;k, whether they have ever calculated the clear produce of any given &s;ales, to make them tally with the four million of bills which are come and coming upon them, &s;o as at the proper periods to enable the one to liqui|date the other? No, they have not. They are now obliged to borrow money of their own &s;ervants to purcha&s;e their inve&s;tment. The &s;ervants &s;tipulate five <HI>per cent.</HI> on the capital they advance, if their bills &s;hould not be paid at the time when they be|come due; and the value of the rupee on which they charge this intere&s;t is taken at two &s;hillings and a penny. Has the company ever troubled them&s;elves to enquire whether their &s;ales can bear the payment of that intere&s;t, and at that rate of exchange? Have they once con&s;idered the dilemma in which they are placed&mdash;the ruin of their credit in the Ea&s;t Indies, if they refu&s;e the bills&mdash;the ruin of their credit and exi&s;tence in England, if they accept them? Indeed no trace of equitable government is found in their politics; not one trace of commercial principle in their mercantile dealing; and hence is the deepe&s;t and ma|true&s;t wi&s;dom of parliament demanded, and the be&s;t re&s;ources of this kingdom mu&s;t be &s;trained, to re|&s;tore them; that is, to re&s;tore the countries de&s;troyed by the mi&s;conduct of the company, and to re&s;tore

The Ro|mans carried this principle a great way. Even the holding of offices together, the di&s;po&s;ition of which aro&s;e from chance not &s;election, gave ri&s;e to a rela|tion which continued for life. It was called <HI>nece&s;&s;i|tudo &s;ortis;</HI> and it was looked upon with a &s;acred re|verence. Breaches of any of the&s;e kinds of civil relation were con&s;idered as acts of the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed turpitude. The whole people was di&s;tributed into political &s;ocieties, in which they acted in &s;upport of &s;uch intere&s;ts in the &s;tate as they &s;everally affected. For it was then thought no crime to endeavour, by every hone&s;t means, to advance to &s;uperiority and power tho&s;e of your own &s;entiments and opinions. This wi&s;e people was far from imagining that tho&s;e connexions had no tie, and obliged to no duty; but that men might quit them without &s;hame, upon every call of intere&s;t. They believed private honour to be the great foundation of public tru&s;t; that friend|&s;hip was no mean &s;tep towards patrioti&s;m; that he who, in the common intercour&s;e of life, &s;hewed he regarded &s;omebody be&s;ides him&s;elf, when he came to act in a public &s;ituation, might probably con&s;ult &s;ome other intere&s;t than his own.

<P>ALL this violent cry again&s;t the nobility I take to be a mere work of art.

<HEAD>NATIONAL TIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE operation of dangerous and delu&s;ive fir&s;t principles obliges us to have recour&s;e to the true ones. In the intercour&s;e between nations, we are apt to rely too much on the in&s;trumental part. We lay too much weight upon the formality of treaties and compacts. We do not act much more wi&s;ely when we tru&s;t to the intere&s;t of men as guarantees of their engagements. The intere&s;ts frequently tear to pieces the engagements; and the pa&s;&s;ions trample upon both. Entirely to tru&s;t to either is to di&s;regard our own &s;afety, or not to know mankind. Men are not tied to one another by papers and &s;eals. They are led to a&s;&s;ociate by re&s;emblances, by conformities, by &s;ympathies. It is with nations as with individuals.
<PB N="228" REF="54">
Nothing is &s;o &s;trong a tie of amity between nation and nation as corre&s;pondence in laws, cu&s;toms, man|ners, and habits of life. They have more than the force of treaties in them&s;elves. They are obligations written in the heart. They approximate men to men, without their knowledge, and &s;ometimes again&s;t their intentions. The &s;ecret, un&s;een, but irrefragable bond of habitual intercour&s;e, holds them together, even when their perver&s;e and litigious nature &s;ets them to equivocate, &s;cuffle, and &s;ight about the terms of their written obligations.</P>
<P>As to war, if it be the means of wrong and vio|lence, it is the &s;ole means of ju&s;tice among&s;t nations. Nothing can bani&s;h it from the world. They who &s;ay otherwi&s;e, intending to impo&s;e upon us, do not impo&s;e upon them&s;elves. But it is one of the greate&s;t objects of human wi&s;dom to mitigate tho&s;e evils which we cannot remove. The conformity and analogy of which I &s;peak, incapable, like every thing el&s;e, of pre&s;erving perfect tru&s;t and tranquillity among men, has a &s;trong tendency to facilitate accommo|dation, and to produce a generous oblivion of the rancour of their quarrels. With this &s;imilitude, peace is more of peace, and war is le&s;s of war. I will go further. There have been periods of time in which communities, apparently in peace with each other, have been more perfectly &s;eparated than, in later times, many nations in Europe have been in the cour&s;e of long and bloody wars. The cau&s;e mu&s;t be &s;ought in the &s;imilitude in Europe of religion, laws, and manners. At bottom, the&s;e are all the &s;ame.

<P>BUT, &s;ay &s;ome, you force opinion. You can never extirpate opinion without extirpating a whole nation. Nay, by pur&s;uing it, you only increa&s;e its partizans. Opinions are things out of human juri&s;|diction. I have formerly heard this from the mouths of great men, with more &s;urprize than &s;atisfaction. They alledged as a proof of their doctrine, the wars of Charles the Fifth, and &s;ome of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, again&s;t the reformation.</P>
<P>It is &s;o common, though &s;o unrea&s;onable, it is hardly worth remarking, that no per&s;ons pur&s;ue more fiercely with criminal proce&s;s, and with every kind of coercion, the publication of opinions contrary to their own, than tho&s;e do, who claim in this re&s;pect the mo&s;t unbounded latitude to them&s;elves.

<P>As to the mere matter of extirpation of all kinds of opinions, whether right or wrong, without the extirpation of a people, it is a thing &s;o very common, that would be clouded and ob&s;cured rather than il|lu&s;trated by examples. Every revolution in the pre|dominant opinion made by the force of dome&s;tic legal government, by the force of any u&s;urpation, by the force of any conque&s;t, is a proof to the con|trary;&mdash;and there is no nation which has not expe|rienced tho&s;e changes. In&s;tances enough may be

furni&s;hed of people who have enthu&s;ia&s;tically, and with force, propagated tho&s;e opinions, which &s;ome time before they re&s;i&s;ted with their blood. Rarely have ever great changes in opinion taken place with|out the application of force, more or le&s;s. Like every thing el&s;e in human life and human affairs, it is not univer&s;ally true, that a per&s;ecution of opinions le&s;&s;ens or increa&s;es the number of their votaries. In finding where it may or may not have gathered the&s;e effects, the &s;agacity of government &s;hines or is di&s;|graced, as well as in the time, the manner, the choice of the opinions on which it ought to u&s;e or forbear the &s;word of dome&s;tic or of foreign ju&s;tice. But it is a fal&s;e maxim, that opinions ought to be indifferent to us, either as men or as a &s;tate. Opinion is the rudder of human action; and as the opinion is wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, vicious or moral, the cau&s;e of action is noxious or &s;alutary. It has even been the great primary object of &s;peculative and doctrinal philo&s;ophy to regulate opinion. It is the great object of poli|tical philo&s;ophy to promote that which is found; and to extirpate what is mi&s;chievous, and which directly tends to render men bad citizens in the community, and mi&s;chievous neighbours out of it. Opinions are of infinite con&s;equence. They make the manners&mdash;in fact, they make the laws: they make the legi&s;lator. They are, therefore, of all things, tho&s;e to which provident government ought to look mo&s;t to in their beginnings. After a time they may look to them in vain. When, therefore, I am told that a war is a war of opinions, I am told that it is the mo&s;t im|portant of all wars.</P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t not be told that this would lead to eternal war and per&s;ecution.

Our bu&s;ine&s;s therefore is to enquire, whether the parts of tho&s;e objects, which are found beautiful in the vegetable or animal kingdoms, are con&s;tantly &s;o formed accord|ing to &s;uch certain mea&s;ures, as may &s;erve to &s;atisfy us that their beauty re&s;ults from tho&s;e mea&s;ures on the principle of a natural mechanical cau&s;e; or from cu&s;tom; or, in fine, from their fitne&s;s for any deter|minate purpo&s;es. I intend to examine this point under each of the&s;e heads in their order. But before I proceed further, I hope it will not be thought ami&s;s, if I lay down the rules which governed me in
<PB N="236" REF="62">
this enquiry, and which have mi&s;&s;ed me in it, if I have gone a&s;tray. 1. If two bodies produce the &s;ame or a &s;imilar effect on the mind, and on exami|nation they are found to agree in &s;ome of their properties, and to differ in others; the common effect is to be attributed to the properties in which they agree, and not to tho&s;e in which they differ. 2. Not to account for the effect of a natural object from the effect of an artificial object. 3. Not to account for the effect of any natural object from a conclu&s;ion of our rea&s;on concerning its u&s;es, if a natural cau&s;e may be a&s;&s;igned. 4. Not to admit any determinate quantity, or any relation of quantity, as the cau&s;e of a certain effect, if the effect is produced by different or oppo&s;ite mea&s;ures and relations; or if the&s;e mea|&s;ures and relations may exi&s;t, and yet the effect may not be produced. The&s;e are the rules which I have chiefly followed, whil&s;t I examined into the power of proportion con&s;idered as a natural cau&s;e; and the&s;e, if he thinks them ju&s;t, I reque&s;t the reader to carry with him throughout the following di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; whil&s;t we enquire in the fir&s;t place, in what things we find this quality of beauty; next, to &s;ee whether in the&s;e we can find any a&s;&s;ignable proportions, in &s;uch a manner as ought to convince us that our idea of beauty re&s;ults from them. We &s;hall con&s;ider this plea&s;ing power, as it appears in vegetables, in the inferior animals, and in man. Turning our eyes to the vegetable creation, we find nothing there &s;o beautiful as flowers; but flowers are almo&s;t of every &s;ort of &s;hape, and of every &s;ort of di&s;po&s;ition; they are turned and fa&s;hioned into an infinite variety of forms; and from the&s;e forms botani&s;ts have given them their names, which are almo&s;t as various. What proportion do we di&s;cover between the &s;talks and the leaves of flowers, or between the leaves and the pi&s;tils? How does the &s;lender &s;talk of the ro&s;e agree with the bulky head under which it bends? but the ro&s;e is a beautiful flower; and can we undertake
<PB N="237" REF="63">
to &s;ay that it does not owe a great deal of its beauty even to that di&s;proportion? the ro&s;e is a large flower, yet it grows upon a &s;mall &s;hrub; the flower of the apple is very &s;mall, and grows upon a large tree, yet the ro&s;e and the apple blo&s;&s;om are both beautiful, and the plants that bear them are mo&s;t engagingly attired, notwith&s;tanding this di&s;proportion. What by general con&s;ent is allowed to be a more beautiful object than an orange tree, flouri&s;hing at once with its leaves, its blo&s;&s;oms, and its fruit? but it is in vain that we &s;earch here for any propor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ion between the height, the breadth, or any thing el&s;e concerning the dimen&s;ions of the whole, or concerning the re|lation of the particular part, to each other.

This is pu|ni&s;hing the offence in the offending part. Until this time, the opinion of the people, through the power of an a&s;&s;embly, &s;till in &s;ome &s;ort popular, led to the greate&s;t honours and emoluments in the gift of the crown.

<HEAD>PARLIAMENT (TRIENNIAL AND PLACE BILL.) A triennial Parliament, or a Place Bill, not competent to effect the Ends propo&s;ed by them.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t ideas which generally &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves, for the cure of parliamentary di&s;orders, are, to &s;horten the duration of parliaments; and to di&s;qualify all, or a great number of placemen, from a &s;eat in the Hou&s;e of Commons. Whatever efficacy there may be in tho&s;e remedies, I am &s;ure, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, it is impo&s;&s;ible to apply them. A re|&s;toration of the right of free election is a preliminary indi&s;pen&s;able to every other reformation. What al|terations ought afterwards to be made in the con&s;ti|tution, is a matter of deep and difficult re&s;earch.</P>
<P>If I wrote merely to plea&s;e the popular palate, it would indeed be as little trouble&s;ome to me as to another, to extol the&s;e remedies, &s;o famous in &s;pe|culation, but to which their greate&s;t admirers have never attempted &s;eriou&s;ly to re&s;ort in practice.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s that I have no &s;ort of reliance upon either a triennial Parliament, or a Place Bill. With regard to the former, perhaps it might rather &s;erve to coun|teract than to promote the ends that are propo&s;ed by it. To &s;ay nothing of the horrible di&s;orders among the people attending frequent elections, I &s;hould be fearful of committing, every three years, the inde|pendent gentlemen of the country into a conte&s;t with
<PB N="242" REF="68">
the Trea&s;ury. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee which of the contend|ing parties would be ruined fir&s;t. Whoever has taken a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ul view of public proceedings, &s;o as to en|deavour to ground his &s;peculations on his experience, mu&s;t have ob&s;erved how prodigiou&s;ly greater the power of Mini&s;try is in the fir&s;t and la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of a parliament, than it is in the intermediate period, when members &s;it a little firm on their &s;eats. The per&s;ons of the greate&s;t parliamentary experience, with whom I have conver&s;ed, did con&s;tantly, in canva&s;&s;ing the &s;ate of que&s;tions, allow &s;omething to the Court &s;ide, upon account of the elections depending or imminent. The evil complained of, if it exi&s;ts in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, would hardly be removed by a trien|nial parliament; for, unle&s;s the influence of Govern|ment in elections can be entirely taken away, the more frequently they return, the more they will har|ra&s;s private independence; the more generally men will be compelled to &s;ly to the &s;ettled &s;y&s;tematic in|tere&s;t of Government, and to the re&s;ources of a boundle&s;s civil li&s;t. Certainly &s;omething may be done, and ought to be done, towards le&s;&s;ening that influence in elections; and this will be nece&s;&s;ary upon a plan either of longer or &s;horter duration of parlia|ment. But nothing can &s;o perfectly remove the evil, as not to render &s;uch contentions, too frequently re|peated, utterly ruinous, fir&s;t to independence of for|tune, and then to independence of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>As I am only giving an opinion on this point, and not at all debating it in adver&s;e line, I hope I may be excu&s;ed in another ob&s;ervation. With great truth I may aver, that I never remember to have talked on this &s;ubject with any man much conver&s;ant with public bu&s;ine&s;s, who con&s;idered &s;hort parliaments as a real improvement of the con&s;titution. Gentlemen, warm in a popular cau&s;e, are ready enough to attri|bute all the declarations of &s;uch per&s;ons to corrupt motives. But the habit of affairs, if, on one hand, it tends to corrupt the mind, furni&s;hes it, on the
<PB N="243" REF="69">
other, with the means of better information. The authority of &s;uch per&s;ons will always have &s;ome weight. It may &s;tand upon a <HI>par</HI> with the &s;pecula|tions of tho&s;e who are le&s;s practi&s;ed in bu&s;ine&s;s; and who, with perhaps purer intentions, have not &s;o ef|fectual means of judging. It is, be&s;ides, an effect of vulgar and puerile malignity to imagine, that every &s;tate&s;man is of cour&s;e corrupt, and that his opinion, upon every con&s;titutional point, is &s;olely formed upon &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The next favourite remedy is a place-bill. The &s;ame principle guides in both; I mean, the opinion which is entertained by many, of the infallibility of laws and regulations, in the cure of public di&s;tempers. Without being as unrea&s;onably doubtful as many are unwi&s;ely confident, I will only &s;ay, that this al&s;o is a matter very well worthy of &s;erious and mature re|flection. It is not ea&s;y to fore&s;ee what the effect would be of di&s;connecting with parliament, the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who hold civil employments, and of &s;uch mighty and important bodies as the military and naval e&s;tabli&s;hments. It were better, perhaps, that they &s;hould have a corrupt intere&s;t in the forms of the con&s;titution, than that they &s;hould have none at all. This is a que&s;tion altogether diffe|rent from the di&s;qualification of a particular de|&s;cription of revenue officers from &s;eats in parliament; or, perhaps, of all the lower &s;orts of them from votes in elections. In the former ca&s;e, only the few are affected; in the latter, only the incon&s;iderable. But a great official, a great profe&s;&s;ional, a great military and naval intere&s;t, all nece&s;&s;arily comprehending many people of the fir&s;t weight, ability, wealth, and &s;pirit, has been gradually formed in the kingdom. The&s;e new intere&s;ts mu&s;t be let into a &s;hare of repre|&s;entation, el&s;e po&s;&s;ibly they may be inclined to de&s;troy tho&s;e in&s;titutions of which they are not per|mitted to partake.

<HEAD>POLITY OF THE SEVERAL COUNTRIES OF EUROPE.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole of the polity and oeconomy of every country in Europe have been derived from the &s;ame &s;ources. They were drawn from the old Germanic or Gothic cu&s;tumary; from the feudal in&s;titutions which mu&s;t be con&s;idered as an emanation from tho&s;e cu&s;toms; and the whole has been improved and di|ge&s;ted into &s;y&s;tem and di&s;cipline by the Roman law. From hence aro&s;e the &s;everal orders, with or without a Monarch, which are called States in every country; the &s;trong traces of which, where Monarchy predo|minated, were never wholly extingui&s;hed or merged in de&s;poti&s;m. In the few places where Monarchy was ca&s;t off, the &s;pirit of European Monarchy was &s;till left. Tho&s;e countries &s;till contiued countries of States, that is, of cla&s;&s;es, orders and di&s;tinctions, &s;uch as had before &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, or nearly &s;o. Indeed the force and form of the in&s;titution called States, continued in greater perfection in tho&s;e republican countries than under Monarchies. From all tho&s;e &s;ources aro&s;e a &s;y&s;tem of manners and of education which was nearly &s;imilar in all countries, and which

&s;oftened, blended, and harmonized the colours of the whole. There was little difference in the form of their Univer&s;ities for the education of their youth, whether with regard to faculties, to &s;ciences, or to that erudition which is u&s;ed to impart, with liberal morals, a kind of elegance to the mind. From this re&s;emblance in the modes of intercour&s;e, and in the whole form and fa&s;hion of life, no citizen of Europe could be altogether an exile in any part of it. There nothing more than a plea&s;ing variety to recreate and in&s;truct the mind; to enrich the imagination; and to meliorate the heart. When a man travelled or re|&s;ided for health, plea&s;ure, bu&s;ine&s;s or nece&s;&s;ity, from his own country, he never felt him&s;elf quite abroad. My friend, Mr. Wyld, the late profe&s;&s;or of law in Edinburgh, a young man of infinite promi&s;e, and who&s;e lo&s;s at this time is ine&s;timable, has beautifully applied two lines of Ovid to this unity and diver&s;ity in Europe, before the cur&s;e of the French Revolu|tion had fallen upon us all.

<Q REND="inline">"Boreas, and Eurus, and Caurus, and Arge&s;tes loud,"</Q> howling through the vacant lobbies, and clattering the doors of de&s;erted guard rooms, appal the imagination, and conjure up the grim &s;pectres of departed tyrants&mdash;the Saxon, the Norman, and the Dane; the &s;tern Edwards and fierce Henries&mdash;who &s;talk from de&s;olation to de&s;o|lation, through the dreary vacuity, and melancholy &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of chill and comfortle&s;s chambers.
When this tumult &s;ub&s;ides, a dead, and &s;till more frightful &s;ilence would reign in this de&s;ert, if every now and then the tacking of hammers did not announce, that tho&s;e con&s;tant attendants upon all courts in all ages, Jobs, were &s;till alive; for who&s;e &s;ake alone it is, that any trace of ancient grandeur is &s;uffered to re|main.

<HEAD>PENSIONS.</HEAD>
<P>INDEED no man knows, when he cuts off the incitements to a virtuous ambition, and the ju&s;t re|wards of public &s;ervice, what infinite mi&s;chief he may do his country, through all generations. Such &s;aving to the public may prove the wor&s;t mode of robbing it. The crown, which has in its hands the tru&s;t of the daily pay for national &s;ervice, ought to have in its hands al&s;o the means for the repo&s;e of public labour, and the fixed &s;ettlement of acknow|ledged

merit. There is a time, when the weather-beaten ve&s;&s;els of the &s;tate ought to come into harbour. They mu&s;t at length have a retreat from the malice of rivals, from the perfidy of political friends, and the incon&s;tancy of the people. Many of the per&s;ons, who in all times have filled the great offices of &s;tate, have been younger brothers, who had originally little, if any fortune. The&s;e offices do not furni&s;h the means of ama&s;&s;ing wealth. There ought to be &s;ome power in the crown of granting pen&s;ions out of the reach of its own caprices. An intail of depen|dence is a bad reward of merit.</P>
<P>I would, therefore, leave to the crown the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of conferring &s;ome favours, which, whil&s;t they are received as a reward, do not operate as corrup|tion. When men receive obligations from the crown through the pious hands of fathers, or of connexions as venerable as the paternal, the dependences which ari&s;e from thence, are the obligations of gratitude, and not the fetters of &s;ervility. Such ties originate in virtue, and they promote it. They continue men in tho&s;e habitudes of friend&s;hip, tho&s;e political con|nexions, and tho&s;e political principles in which they began life. They are antidotes again&s;t a corrupt levity, in&s;tead of cau&s;es of it. What an un&s;eemly &s;pectacle would it afford, what a di&s;grace would it be to the commonwealth that &s;uffered &s;uch things, to &s;ee the hopeful &s;on of a meritorious mini&s;ter begging his bread at the door of that trea&s;ury, from whence his father di&s;pen&s;ed the oeconomy of an empire, and promoted the happine&s;s and glory of his country? Why &s;hould he be obliged to pro&s;trate his honour, and to &s;ubmit his principles at the levee of &s;ome proud favourite, &s;houldered and thru&s;t a&s;ide by every impudent pretender, on the very &s;pot where a few days before he &s;aw him&s;elf adored?&mdash;obliged to cringe to the author of the calamities of his hou&s;e, and to ki&s;s the hands that are red with his father's blood?&mdash;No, Sir, the&s;e things are unfit&mdash;They are intolerable.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="75">Sir, I &s;hall be a&s;ked, why I do not chu&s;e to de&s;troy tho&s;e offices which are pen&s;ions, and appoint pen&s;ions under the direct title in their &s;tead? I allow, that in &s;ome ca&s;es it leads to abu&s;e; to have things appointed for one purpo&s;e, and applied to another. I have no great objection to &s;uch a change: but I do not think it quite prudent for me to propo&s;e it. If I &s;hould take away the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, the burthen of proof re&s;ts upon me, that &s;o many pen&s;ions, and no more, and to &s;uch an amount each, and no more, are nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;ervice. This is what I can never prove; for it is a thing incapable of defi|nition. I do not like to take away an object that I think an&s;wers my purpo&s;e, in hopes of getting it back again in a better &s;hape. People will bear an old e&s;tabli&s;hment when its exce&s;s is corrected, who will revolt at a new one. I do not think the&s;e office-pen&s;ions to be more in number than &s;ufficient: but on that point the hou&s;e will exerci&s;e its di&s;cretion. As to abu&s;e, I am convinced, that very few tru&s;ts in the ordinary cour&s;e of admini&s;tration, have admitted le&s;s abu&s;e than this. Efficient mini&s;ters have been their own payma&s;ters. It is true. But their very partiality has operated as a kind of ju&s;tice; and &s;till it was &s;ervice that was paid. When we look over this exchequer li&s;t, we find it filled with the de|&s;cendants of the Walpoles, of the Pelhams, of the Town&s;hends; names to whom this country owes its liberties; and to whom his maje&s;ty owes his crown.

<HEAD>PROTECTION. The Influence of Protection de&s;troyed by Mr. Fox's India Bill.</HEAD>
<P>BUT, Sir, there is one kind of influence far greater than that of the nomination to office. This, gentle|men in oppo&s;ition have totally overlooked, although it now exi&s;ts in its full vigour; and it will do &s;o, upon their &s;cheme, in at lea&s;t as much force as it does now. That influence this bill cuts up by the roots; I mean the <HI>influence of protection.</HI> I &s;hall explain my&s;elf:&mdash;The office given to a young man going to India is of trifling con&s;equence. But he that goes out an in&s;ig|nificant boy, in a few years returns a great Nabob. Mr. Ha&s;tings &s;ays he has two hundred and fifty of that kind of raw materials, who expect to be &s;peedily manufactured into the merchantable quality I men|tion.
<PB N="251" REF="77">
One of the&s;e gentlemen, &s;uppo&s;e, returns hither, loaded with odium and with riches. When he comes to England, he comes as to a pri&s;on or as to a &s;anc|tuary; and either are ready for him, according to his demeanor. What is the influence in the grant of any place in India, to that which is acquired by the pro|tection or compromi&s;e with &s;uch guilt, and with the command of &s;uch riches, under the dominion of the hopes and fears which power is able to hold out to every man in that condition? That man's whole for|tune, half a million perhaps, becomes an in&s;trument of influence, without a &s;hilling of charge to the civil li&s;t; and the in&s;lux of fortunes which &s;tand in need of this protection is continual. It works both ways; it influences the delinquent, and it may corrupt the mini&s;ter. Compare the influence acquired by ap|pointing, for in&s;tance, even a Governor General, and that obtained by protecting him. I &s;hall pu&s;h this no further. But I wi&s;h gentlemen to roll it a little in their own minds.</P>
<P>The bill before you cuts off this &s;ource of influence. Its de&s;ign and main &s;cope is to regulate the admini|&s;tration of India upon the principles of a Court of Judicature; and to exclude, as far as human prudence can exclude, all po&s;&s;ibility of a corrupt partiality, in appointing to office, or &s;upporting in office, or co+vering from enquiry and puni&s;hment, any per&s;on who has abu&s;ed, or &s;hall abu&s;e his authority. At the Board, as appointed and regulated by this bill, re|ward and puni&s;hment cannot be &s;hifted and rever&s;ed by a whi&s;per. That commi&s;&s;ion becomes fatal to cabal, to intrigue, and to &s;ecret repre&s;entation, tho&s;e in&s;truments of the ruin of India. He that cuts off the means of premature fortune, and the power of pro|tecting it when acquired, &s;trikes a deadly blow at the great fund, the bank, the capital &s;tock of Indian in|fluence, which cannot be ve&s;ted any where, or in any hands, without mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences to the public.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Speech on Mr. Fox's Ea&s;t-India Bill.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>PROBERT. The famous Hi&s;tory of the Revenue Adventures of the bold Baron North and the good Knight Probert, upon the Mountains of Venodotia.</HEAD>
<P>AN attempt was lately made to improve this branch of local influence, (Principality of Wales) and to transfer it to the fund of general corruption. I have on the &s;eat behind me, the con&s;titution of Mr. John Probert, a knight errant, dubbed by the noble lord in the blue ribbon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord North.</NOTE>, and &s;ent to &s;earch for revenues and adventures upon the mountains of Wales. The commi&s;&s;ion is remarkable; and the event not le&s;s &s;o.
The commi&s;&s;ion &s;ets forth, that
<Q REND="inline">"Upon a report of the <HI>deputy auditor</HI> (for there is a deputy auditor) of the principality of Wales,) it appeared, that his Maje&s;ty's land revenues in the &s;aid principality, <HI>are greatly dimini&s;hed</HI>;"</Q>
and
<Q REND="inline">"that upon a <HI>report</HI> of the <HI>&s;urveyor general</HI> of his Maje&s;ty's land reve|nues, upon a <HI>memorial</HI> of the auditor of his Maje&s;ty's revenues <HI>within the &s;aid principality,</HI> that his mines and fore&s;ts have produced very <HI>little profit either to the public revenue or to individuals;</HI>"</Q>  and therefore they appoint Mr. Probert, with a pen&s;ion of three hundred pounds a year from the &s;aid principality, to try whe|ther he can make any thing more of that very <HI>little</HI> which is &s;tated to be &s;o <HI>greatly</HI> dimini&s;hed.
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>A beg|garly account of empty boxes.</HI>"</Q> And yet, Sir, you will remark, that this diminution from littlene&s;s (which &s;erves only to prove the infinite divi&s;ibility of matter) was not for want of the tender and officious care (as we &s;ee) of &s;urveyors general, and &s;urveyors particu|lar;

of auditors and deputy-auditors; not for want of memorials, and remon&s;trances, and reports, and commi&s;&s;ions, and con&s;titutions, and inqui&s;itions, and pen&s;ions.</P>
<P>Probert, thus armed, and accoutred, and paid, proceeded on his adventure; but he was no &s;ooner arrived on the confines of Wales, than all Wales was in arms to meet him. That nation is brave, and full of &s;pirit. Since the inva&s;ion of King Edward, and the ma&s;&s;acre of the bards, there never was &s;uch a tu|mult, and alarm, and uproar, through the region of <HI>Pre&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ya. Snowden</HI> &s;hook to its ba&s;e; <HI>Cader Edris</HI> was loo&s;ened from its foundations. The fury of li|tigious was blew her horn on the mountains. The rocks poured down their goatherds, and the deep caverns vomited out their miners. Every thing above ground, and every thing under ground, was in arms. In &s;hort, Sir, to alight from my Wel&s;h Pega&s;us, and to come to level ground; the <HI>preux Chevalier</HI> Probert went to look for revenue, like his ma&s;ters upon other occa&s;ions, and like his ma&s;ters, he found rebellion. But we were grown cautious by experience. A civil war of paper might end in a more &s;erious war; for now remon&s;trance met remon&s;trance, and memorial was oppo&s;ed to memorial. The wi&s;e Britons thought it more rea&s;onable, that the poor, wa&s;ted, decrepit revenue of the principality, &s;hould die a natural than a violent death. In truth, Sir, the attempt was no le&s;s an affront upon the under&s;tanding of that re&s;pect|able people, than it was an attack on their property. They cho&s;e that their ancient mo&s;s-grown ca&s;tles &s;hould moulder into decay, under the &s;ilent touches of time, and the &s;low formality of an oblivious and drow&s;y Exchequer, than that they &s;hould be battered down all at once by the lively efforts of a pen&s;ioned engineer. As it is the fortune of the noble lord to whom the au&s;pices of this campaign belonged, fre|quently to provoke re&s;i&s;tance, &s;o it is his rule and nature to yield to that re&s;i&s;tance <HI>in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</HI>

<HEAD>POETRY. Its Powers and Province.</HEAD>
<P>SO little does poetry depend for its effect on the power of rai&s;ing &s;en&s;ible images, that I am con|vinced it would lo&s;e a very con&s;iderable part of its energy if this were the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of all de|&s;cription. Becau&s;e that union of affecting words, which is the mo&s;t powerful of all poetical in&s;tru|ments, would frequently lo&s;e its force along with its propriety and con&s;i&s;tency, if the &s;en&s;ible images were always excited. There is not perhaps in the whole Aeneid a more grand and laboured pa&s;&s;age than the de&s;cription of Vulcan's cavern in Aetna, and the works that are there carried on. Virgil dwells particularly on the formation of the thun|der, which he de&s;cribes unfini&s;hed under the ham|mers of the Cyclops. But what are the principles of this extraordinary compo&s;ition?<Q><L>Tres imbris torti radios, tres nubis aquo&s;oe</L>
<L>Addiderant; rutili tres ignis et alitis au&s;tri;</L>
<L>Fulgores nunc terrificos, &s;onitumque, metumque</L>
<L>Mi&s;cebant operi, flammi&s;que &s;equacibus iras.</L></Q></P>
<P>This &s;eems to me admirably &s;ublime; yet if we attend coolly to the kind of &s;en&s;ible images which a
<PB N="256" REF="82">
combination of ideas of this &s;ort mu&s;t form, the chi|meras of madmen cannot appear more wild and ab|&s;urd than &s;uch a picture.

This &s;trange com|po&s;ition is formed into a gro&s;s body; it is hammered by the Cyclops, it is in part poli&s;hed, and partly continues rough. The truth is, if poetry gives us a noble a&s;&s;emblage of words, corre&s;ponding to many noble ideas, which are connected by circum&s;tances of time or place, or related to each other as cau&s;e and effect, or a&s;&s;ociated in any natural way, they may be moulded together in any form, and perfectly an&s;wer their end. The picture&s;que connexion is not demanded; becau&s;e no real picture is formed; nor is the effect of the de&s;cription at all the le&s;s upon this account. What is &s;aid of Helen by Priam and the old men of his council, is generally thought to give us the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible idea of that fatal beauty.

Here is not one word &s;aid of the particulars of her beauty; nothing which can in the lea&s;t help us to any preci&s;e idea of her per&s;on; but yet we are much more touched by this manner of mentioning her than by tho&s;e long and laboured de&s;criptions of Helen, whe|ther handed down by tradition, or formed by fancy, which are to be met with in &s;ome authors. I am &s;ure it affects me much more than the minute de&s;cription which Spencer has given of Belphebe; though I own
<PB N="257" REF="83">
that there are parts in that de&s;cription, as there are in all the de&s;criptions of that excellent writer, ex|tremely fine and poetical. The terrible picture which Lucretius has drawn of religion, in order to di&s;play the magnanimity of his philo&s;ophical hero in oppo&s;ing her, is thought to be de&s;igned with great boldne&s;s and &s;pirit;
<Q><L>Humana ante oculos foed&egrave; cum vita jaceret,</L>

What idea do you derive from &s;o excellent a picture? None at all, mo&s;t certainly; neither has the poet &s;aid a &s;ingle word which might in the lea&s;t &s;erve to mark a &s;ingle limb or feature of the phantom, which he intended to repre&s;ent in all the horrors imagination can conceive. In reality poetry and rhetoric do not &s;ucceed in exact de&s;cription &s;o well as painting does; their bu&s;ine&s;s is, to affect rather by &s;ympathy than imitation; to di&s;play rather the effect of things on the mind of the &s;peaker, or of others, than to pre|&s;ent a clear idea of the things them&s;elves.

<HEAD>PASSIONS. The Rationale of our Pa&s;&s;ions very nece&s;&s;ary.</HEAD>
<P>THE more accurately we &s;earch into the human mind, the &s;tronger traces we every where find of his wi&s;dom who made it. If a di&s;cour&s;e on the u&s;e of the parts of the body may be con&s;idered as an hymn to the Creator; the u&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ions, which are the organs of the mind, cannot be barren of prai&s;e to him, nor unproductive to our&s;elves of that noble and uncommon union of &s;cience and admira|tion, which a contemplation of the works of infinite wi&s;dom alone can afford to a rational mind; whil&s;t, referring to him whatever we find of right or good or fair in our&s;elves, di&s;covering his &s;trength and wi&s;dom even in our own weakne&s;s and imperfection, honouring them where we di&s;cover them clearly, and adoring their profundity where we are lo&s;t in our &s;earch, we may be inqui&s;itive without impertinence, and elevated without pride; we may be admitted, if I may dare to &s;ay &s;o, into the coun&s;els of the Al|mighty by a con&s;ideration of his works. The eleva|tion of the mind ought to be the principal end of all our &s;tudies, which if they do not in &s;ome mea&s;ure effect, they are of very little &s;ervice to us. But, be&s;ides this great purpo&s;e, a con&s;ideration of the ra|tionale of our pa&s;&s;ions &s;eems to me very nece&s;&s;ary for all who would affect them upon &s;olid and &s;ure principles. It is not enough to know them in general: to affect them after a delicate manner, or to judge properly of any work de&s;igned to affect them, we &s;hould know the exact boundaries of their &s;everal juri&s;dictions; we &s;hould pur&s;ue them through all their variety of operations, and pierce into the in|mo&s;t, and what might appear inacce&s;&s;ible parts of our nature,
<Q>Quod latet arcan&acirc; non enarrabile fibr&acirc;.</Q>
Without all this it is po&s;&s;ible for a man, after a con|fu&s;ed manner, &s;ometimes to &s;atisfy his own mind of
<PB N="260" REF="86">
the truth of his work; but he can never have a cer|tain determinate rule to go by, not can he ever make his propo&s;itions &s;ufficiently clear to others. Poets, and orators, and painters, and tho&s;e who cultivate other branches of the liberal arts, have without this critical knowledge &s;ucceeded well in their &s;everal provinces, and will &s;ucceed; as among artificers there are many machines made, and even invented without any exact knowledge of the principles they are go|verned by. It is, I own, not uncommon to be wrong in theory, and right in practice; and we are happy that it is &s;o. Men often act right from their feelings, who afterwards rea&s;on but ill on them from principle; but as it is impo&s;&s;ible to avoid an attempt at &s;uch rea&s;oning, and equally impo&s;&s;ible to prevent its having &s;ome influence on our practice, &s;urely it is worth taking &s;ome pains to have it ju&s;t, and founded on the ba&s;is of &s;ure experience. We might expect that the arti&s;ts them&s;elves would have been our &s;ure&s;t guides; but the arti&s;ts have been too much occupied in the practice: the philo&s;ophers have done little; and what they have done, was mo&s;tly with a view to their own &s;chemes and &s;y&s;tems: and as for tho&s;e called critics, they have generally &s;ought the rule of the arts in the wrong place; they &s;ought it among poems, pictures, engravings, &s;tatues, and buildings. But art can never give the rules that make an art. This is, I believe, the rea&s;on why arti&s;ts in general, and poets principally, have been confined in &s;o narrow a circle; they have been rather imita|tors of one another than of nature; and this with &s;o faithful an uniformity, and to &s;o remote an antiquity, that it is h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d to &s;ay who gave the fir&s;t model. Cri|tics follow them, and therefore can do little as guides. I can judge but poorly of any thing, whil&s;t I mea|&s;ure it by no other &s;tandard than it&s;elf. The true &s;tandard of the arts is in every man's power; and an ea&s;y ob&s;ervation of the mo&s;t common, &s;ometimes of the meane&s;t things in nature, will give the true&s;t

In an enquiry it is almo&s;t every thing to be once in a right road. I am &s;atisfied I have done but little by the&s;e ob&s;ervations con&s;idered in them&s;elves; and I never &s;hould have taken the pains to dige&s;t them, much le&s;s &s;hould I have ever ventured to pub|li&s;h them, if I was not convinced that nothing tends more to the corruption of &s;cience than to &s;uffer it to &s;lagnate. The&s;e waters mu&s;t be troubled before they can exert their virtues.

<HEAD>PROPERTY, Ought to be, out of all Proportion, predominant in the Repre&s;entation.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is a due and adequate repre&s;entation of a &s;tate, that does not repre&s;ent its ability, as well as its property. But as ability is a vigorous and active principle, and as property is &s;luggi&s;h, inert, and ti|mid, it never can be &s;afe from the inva&s;ions of ability, unle&s;s it be, out of all proportion, predominant in the repre&s;entation. It mu&s;t be repre&s;ented too in great ma&s;&s;es of accumulation, or it is not rightly pro|tected. The characteri&s;tic e&s;&s;ence of property, formed out of the combined principles of its acqui&s;ition and con&s;ervation, is to be <HI>unequal.</HI> The great ma&s;&s;es, therefore, which excite envy, and tempt rapacity,
<PB N="263" REF="89">
mu&s;t be put out of the po&s;&s;ibility of danger. Then they form a natural rampart about the le&s;&s;er proper|ties in all their gradations. The &s;ame quantity of property, which is by the natural cour&s;e of things di|vided among many, has not the &s;ame operation. Its defen&s;ive power is weakened as it is diffu&s;ed. In this diffu&s;ion each man's portion is le&s;s than what, in the eagerne&s;s of his de&s;ires, he may flatter him&s;elf to obtain by di&s;&s;ipating the accumulations of others.&mdash;The plunder of the few would indeed give but a &s;hare inconceivably &s;mall in the di&s;tribution to the many. But the many are not capable of making this calcula|tion; and tho&s;e who lead them to rapine, never intend this di&s;tribution.</P>
<P>The power of perpetuating our property in our families, is one of the mo&s;t valuable and intere&s;ting circum&s;tances belonging to it, and that which tends the mo&s;t to the perpetuation of &s;ociety it&s;elf. It makes our weakne&s;s &s;ub&s;ervient to our virtue; it grafts benevolence even upon avarice. The po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors of family wealth, and of the di&s;tinction which attends hereditary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, (as mo&s;t concerned in it) are the natural &s;ecurities for this tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;With us, the Hou&s;e of Peers is formed upon this principle. It is wholly compo&s;ed of hereditary pro|perty and hereditary di&s;tinction; and made therefore the third of the Legi&s;lature; and in the la&s;t event, the &s;ole judge of all property in all its &s;ubdivi&s;ions. The Hou&s;e of Commons too, though not nece&s;&s;arily, yet in fact is always &s;o compo&s;ed in the far greater part. Let tho&s;e large proprietors be what they will, and they have their chance of being among the be&s;t, they are at the very wor&s;t, the balla&s;t in the ve&s;&s;el of the commonwealth. For though hereditary wealth, and the rank which goes with it, are too much idolized by creeping &s;ycophants, and the blind abject admirers of power, they are too ra&s;hly &s;lighted in &s;hallow &s;pe|culations of the petulant, a&s;&s;uming, &s;hort-&s;ighted cox|combs of philo&s;ophy.

<HEAD>POLISH REVOLUTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tate of Poland was &s;uch, that there could &s;carcely exi&s;t two opinions, but that a reformation of its con&s;titution, even at &s;ome expence of blood, might be &s;een without much di&s;approbation. No confu&s;ion could be &s;eared in &s;uch an enterprize; be|cau&s;e the e&s;tabli&s;hment to be reformed was it&s;elf a &s;tate of confu&s;ion.

But in what manner was this chaos brought into order? The means were as &s;triking to the imagination, as &s;atisfactory to the rea&s;on, and &s;oothing to the moral &s;entiments. In contemplating that change, humanity has every thing to rejoice and to glory in; nothing to be a&s;hamed of, nothing to &s;uffer. So far as it has gone, it probably is the mo&s;t pure and defecated public good which has ever been conferred on mankind. We have &s;een anarchy and &s;ervitude at once removed; a throne &s;trengthened for the protection of the people, without trenching on their liberties; all foreign cabal bani&s;hed, by changing the crown from elective to hereditary; and what was a matter of plea&s;ing wonder, we have &s;een a reigning king, from an heroic love to his country, exerting him&s;elf with all the toil, the dexterity, the management, the intrigue, in favour of a family of &s;trangers, with which ambitious men labour for the aggrandi&s;ement of their own.

Every thing was kept in its place and order; but in that place and order every thing was bettered. To add to this happy wonder, this unheard of conjunction of wi&s;dom and fortune, not one drop of blood was &s;pilled; no treachery; no outrage; no &s;y&s;tem of &s;lander, more cruel than the &s;word; no &s;tudied in&s;ults on religion, morals, or manners; no &s;poil; no confi&s;cation; no citizen beggared; none impri&s;oned; none exiled: the whole was effected with a policy, a di&s;cretion, an unanimity and &s;ecre&s;y, &s;uch as have never been be|fore known on any occa&s;ion; but &s;uch wonderful conduct was re&s;erved for this glorious con&s;piracy in favour of the true and genuine rights and intere&s;ts of men.

<P>THEY (the French faction) cannot pretend that France had &s;tood &s;o much in need of a change as Poland.

They cannot a&s;&s;ert, that the Poli&s;h revolution co&s;t more dearly than that of France to the intere&s;ts and feelings of multitudes of men. But the cold and &s;ubordinate light in which they look upon the one, and the pains they take to preach up the other of the&s;e revolutions, leave us no choice in fixing on their motives. Both revolutions profe&s;s liberty as their object; but in obtaining this object the one proceeds from anarchy to order: the other from order to anarchy.

<HEAD>POWER. Always accompanied by Terror.</HEAD>
<P>I KNOW &s;ome people are of opinion, that no awe, no degree of terror, accompanies the idea of power; and have hazarded to affirm, that we can contemplate the idea of God him&s;elf, without any &s;uch emotion. I purpo&s;ely avoided, when I fir&s;t con&s;idered this &s;ub|ject, to introduce the idea of that great and tremen|dous Being, as an example in an argument &s;o light as this; though it frequently occurred to me, not as an objection to, but as a &s;trong confirmation of, my notions in this matter. I hope, in what I am going to &s;ay, I &s;hall avoid pre&s;umption, where it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for any mortal to &s;peak with &s;trict propriety. I &s;ay then, that whil&s;t we con&s;ider the Godhead merely as he is an object of the under&s;tanding, which forms a complex idea of power, wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s, all &s;tretched to a degree far exceeding the bounds of our comprehen&s;ion, whil&s;t we con&s;ider the Divinity in this refined and ab&s;tracted light, the ima|gination and pa&s;&s;ions are little or nothing affected. But becau&s;e we are bound, by the condition of our nature, to a&s;cend to the&s;e pure and intellectual ideas, through the medium of &s;en&s;ible images, and to judge of the&s;e divine qualities by their evident acts and ex|ertions, it becomes extremely hard to di&s;entangle our
<PB N="268" REF="94">
idea of the cau&s;e from the effect by which we are led to know it. Thus when we contemplate the Deity, his attributes and their operation coming united on the mind, form a &s;ort of &s;en&s;ible image, and as &s;uch are capable of affecting the imagination. Now, though in a ju&s;t idea of the Deity, perhaps none of his attributes are predominant, yet to our imagination, his power is by far the mo&s;t &s;triking. Some reflec|tion, &s;ome comparing, is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;atisfy us of his wi&s;dom, his ju&s;tice, and his goodne&s;s. To be &s;truck with his power, it is only nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould open our eyes. But whil&s;t we contemplate &s;o va&s;t an object, under the arm, as it were, of almighty power, and inve&s;ted upon every &s;ide with omnipre|&s;ence, we &s;hrink into the minutene&s;s of our own nature, and are, in a manner, annihilated before him. And though a con&s;ideration of his other attributes may relieve in &s;ome mea&s;ure our apprehen&s;ions; yet no conviction of the ju&s;tice with which it is exerci&s;ed, nor the mercy with which it is tempered, can wholly remove the terror that naturally ari&s;es from a force which nothing can with&s;tand. If we rejoice, we re|joice with trembling; and even whil&s;t we are receiv|ing benefits, we cannot but &s;hudder at a power which can confer benefits of &s;uch mighty importance.&mdash;When the prophet David contemplated the wonders of wi&s;dom and power which are di&s;played in the oeco|nomy of man, he &s;eems to be &s;truck with a &s;ort of divine horror, and cries out, <HI>Fearfully and wonder|fully am I made!</HI> An heathen poet has a &s;entiment of a &s;imilar nature; Horace looks upon it as the la&s;t effort of philo&s;ophical fortitude, to behold without terror and amazement, this immen&s;e and glorious fabric of the univer&s;e:
<Q><L>Hunc &s;olem, et &s;tellas, et decedentia certis</L>

Lucretius is a poet not to be &s;u&s;pected of giving way to &s;uper&s;titious terrors; yet when he &s;uppo&s;es the
<PB N="269" REF="95">
whole mechani&s;m of nature laid open by the ma&s;ter of his philo&s;ophy, his tran&s;port on this magnificent view, which he has repre&s;ented in the colours of &s;uch bold and lively poetry, is overca&s;t with a &s;hade of &s;ecret dread and horror:
<Q><L>His tibi me rebus quoedam divina voluptas</L>
<L>Percipit, atque horror, quod &s;ic Natura tua vi</L>
<L>Tam mani&s;e&s;la palet ex omni parte retecta.</L></Q>
But the &s;cripture alone can &s;upply ideas an&s;werable to the maje&s;ty of this &s;ubject. In the &s;cripture, wherever God is repre&s;ented as appearing or &s;peak|ing, every thing terrible in nature is called up to heighten the awe and &s;olemnity of the divine pre|&s;ence. The p&s;alms, and the prophetical books, are crowded with in&s;tances of this kind. <HI>The earth &s;hook</HI> (&s;ays the p&s;almi&s;t), <HI>the heavens al&s;o dropped at the pre&s;ence of the Lord.</HI> And what is remarkable, the painting pre&s;erves the &s;ame character, not only when he is &s;uppo&s;ed de&s;cending to take vengeance upon the wicked, but even when he exerts the like pleni|tude of power in acts of beneficence to mankind. <HI>Tremble thou earth! at the pre&s;ence of the Lord; at the pre&s;ence of the God of Jacob; which turned the rock into &s;tanding water, the &s;lint vnto a fountain of waters!</HI> It were endle&s;s to enumerate all the pa&s;&s;ages, both in the &s;acred and profane writers, which e&s;tabli&s;h the general &s;entiment of mankind, concerning the in&s;e|parable union of a &s;acred and reverential awe, with our ideas of the divinity. Hence the common maxim, <HI>Primos in orbe deos fecit timor.</HI> This maxim may be, as I believe it is, fal&s;e with regard to the origin of religion. The maker of the maxim &s;aw how in&s;eparable the&s;e ideas were, without con&s;idering that the notion of &s;ome great power mu&s;t be always precedent to our dread of it. But this dread mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow the idea of &s;uch a power, when it is once excited in the mind. It is on this principle
<PB N="270" REF="96">
that true religion has, and mu&s;t have, &s;o large a mixture of &s;alutary fear; and that fal&s;e religions have generally nothing el&s;e but fear to &s;upport them. Before the chri&s;tian religion had, as it were, human|ized the idea of the Divinity, and brought it &s;ome|what nearer to us, there was very little &s;aid of the love of God. The followers of Plato have &s;omething of it, and only &s;omething; the other writers of pagan antiquity, whether poets or philo&s;ophers, nothing at all. And they who con&s;ider with what infinite at|tention, by what a di&s;regard of every peri&s;hable object, through what long habits of piety and con|templation it is, any man is able to attain an entire love and devotion to the Deity, will ea&s;ily perceive, that it is not the fir&s;t, the mo&s;t natural, and the mo&s;t &s;triking effect which proceeds from that idea. Thus we have traced power through its &s;everal gradations unto the highe&s;t of all, where our imagination is finally lo&s;t; and we find terror, quite throughout the progre&s;s, its in&s;eparable companion, and growing along with it, as far as we can po&s;&s;ibly trace them. Now, as power is undoubtedly a capital &s;ource of the &s;ublime, this will point out evidently from whence its energy is derived, and to what cla&s;s of ideas we ought to unite it.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Sublime and Beautiful.</HI></BIBL></P>

They were ea&s;ily led to con&s;ider the flames that were con&s;uming France, not as a warning to protect their own buildings, (which were without any party wall, and linked by a contig|nation into the edifice of France) as an happy occa|&s;ion for the pillaging the goods, and for carrying off the materials of their neighbour's hou&s;e. Their provident fears were changed into avaricious hopes. They carried on their new de&s;igns without &s;eeming to abandon the principles of their old policy. They pretended to &s;eek, or they flattered them&s;elves that they &s;ought, in the acce&s;&s;ion of new fortre&s;&s;es, and new territories, a <HI>defen&s;ive</HI> &s;ecurity. But the &s;ecu|rity wanted was again&s;t a kind of power, which was not dangerous in its fortre&s;&s;es nor in it's territories, but in it's &s;pirit and it's principles. They aimed, or pretended to aim, at <HI>de&s;ending</HI> them&s;elves again&s;t a danger, from which there can be no &s;ecurity in any <HI>defen&s;ive</HI> plan. If armies and fortre&s;&s;es were a de|fence again&s;t Jacobini&s;m, Louis the Sixteenth would this day reign a powerful monarch over an happy people.</P>
<P>This error obliged them, even in their offen&s;ive operations, to adopt a plan of war again&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s of which there was &s;omething little &s;hort of mathe|matical demon&s;tration. They refu&s;ed to take any &s;tep which might &s;trike at the heart of affairs. They &s;eemed unwilling to wound the enemy in any vital

part. They acted through the whole, as if they really wi&s;hed the con&s;ervation of the Jacobin power; as what might be more favourable than the lawful Go|vernment to the attainment of the petty objects they looked for. They always kept on the circumfer|ence; and the wider and remoter the circle was, the more eagerly they cho&s;e as their &s;phere of action. The plan they pur&s;ued, in it's nature, demanded great length of time. In it's execution they who went the neare&s;t way to work were obliged to cover an incre|dible extent of country. It le&s;t to the enemy every means of de&s;troying this extended line of weakne&s;s. Ill &s;ucce&s;s in any part was &s;ure to defeat the effect of the whole. This is true of Au&s;tria. It is &s;till more true of England. On this fal&s;e plan, even good fortune, by further weakening the victor, put him but the further off from his object.</P>
<P>As long as there was any appearance of &s;ucce&s;s, the &s;pirit of aggrandizement, and con&s;equently the &s;pirit of mutual jealou&s;y &s;eized upon all the coale&s;eed Powers.

<HEAD>PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST the&s;e nice, and therefore dangerous points of ca&s;ui&s;try, may be reckoned the que&s;tion &s;o much agitated in the pre&s;ent hour&mdash;Whether, after the people have di&s;charged them&s;elves of their ori|ginal power by an habitual delegation, no occa&s;ion can po&s;&s;ibly occur which may ju&s;tify their re&s;umption of it? This que&s;tion, in this latitude, is very hard to affirm or deny: but I am &s;atisfied that no occa&s;ion can ju&s;tify &s;uch a re&s;umption, which would not equally authorize a di&s;pen&s;ation with any other moral
<PB N="273" REF="99">
duty, perhaps with all of them together. However, if in general it be not ea&s;y to determine concerning the lawfulne&s;s of &s;uch devious proceedings, which mu&s;t be ever on the edge of crimes, it is far from difficult to fore&s;ee the perilous con&s;equences of the re&s;u&s;citation of &s;uch a power in the people. The practical con&s;equences of any political tenet go a great way in deciding upon its value. Political pro|blems do not primarily concern truth or fal&s;ehood. They relate to good or evil. What in the re&s;ult is likely to produce evil, is politically fal&s;e: that which is productive of good, politically is true.</P>
<P>Believing it therefore a que&s;tion at lea&s;t arduous in the theory, and in the practice very critical, it would become us to a&s;certain, as well as we can, what form it is that our incantations are about to call up from darkne&s;s and the &s;leep of ages. When the &s;upreme authority of the people is in que&s;tion, be|fore we attempt to extend or to confine it, we ought to fix in our minds, with &s;ome degree of di&s;tinctne&s;s, an idea of what it is we mean when we &s;ay the PEOPLE.</P>
<P>In a &s;tate of <HI>rude</HI> nature there is no &s;uch thing as a people. A number of men in them&s;elves have no collective capacity. The idea of a people is the idea of a corporation. It is wholly artificial; and made like all other legal fictions by common agree|ment. What the particular nature of that agreement was, is collected from the form into which the parti|cular &s;ociety has been ca&s;t. Any other is not <HI>their</HI> covenant. When men, therefore, break up the ori|ginal compact or agreement which gives its corporate form and capacity to a &s;tate, they are no longer a people; they have no longer a corporate exi&s;tence; they have no longer a legal coactive force to bind within, nor a claim to be recognized abroad. They are a number of vague loo&s;e individuals, and no|thing more. With them all is to begin again. Alas! they little know how many a weary &s;tep is to be taken
<PB N="274" REF="100">
before they can form them&s;elves into a ma&s;s, which has a true politic per&s;onality.</P>
<P>We hear much from men, who have not acquired their hardine&s;s of a&s;&s;ertion from the pro&s;undity of their thinking, about the omnipotence of a <HI>majority,</HI> in &s;uch a di&s;&s;olution of an antient &s;ociety as hath taken place in France. But among&s;t men &s;o di&s;|banded, there can be no &s;uch thing as majority or minority; or power in any one per&s;on to bind an|other. The power of acting by a majority, which the gentlemen theori&s;ts &s;eem to a&s;&s;ume &s;o readily, after they have violated the contract out of which it has ari&s;en, (if at all it exi&s;ted) mu&s;t be grounded on two a&s;&s;umptions; fir&s;t, that of an incorporation pro|duced by unanimity; and &s;econdly, an unanimous agreement, that the act of a mere majority (&s;ay of one) &s;hall pa&s;s with them and with others as the act of the whole.</P>
<P>We are &s;o little affected by things which are ha|bitual, that we con&s;ider this idea of the deci&s;ion of a <HI>majority</HI> as if it were a law of our original nature: but &s;uch con&s;tructive whole, re&s;iding in a part only, is one of the mo&s;t violent fictions of po&s;itive law, that ever has been or can be made on the principles of artificial incorporation. Out of civil &s;ociety nature knows nothing of it; nor are men, even when ar|ranged according to civil order, otherwi&s;e than by very long training, brought at all to &s;ubmit to it. The mind is brought far more ea&s;ily to acquie&s;ce in the proceedings of one man, or a few, who act under a general procuration for the &s;tate, than in the vote of a victorious majority in councils in which every man has his &s;hare in the deliberation. For there the beaten party are exa&s;perated and &s;oured by the pre|vious contention, and mortified by the conclu&s;ive defeat. This mode of deci&s;ion, where wills may be &s;o nearly equal, where, according to circum&s;tances, the &s;maller number may be the &s;tronger force, and where apparent rea&s;on may be all upon one &s;ide,
<PB N="275" REF="101">
and on the other little el&s;e than impetuous appetite; all this mu&s;t be the re&s;ult of a very particular and &s;pecial convention, confirmed afterwards by long habits of obedience, by a &s;ort of di&s;cipline in &s;ociety, and by a &s;trong hand, ve&s;ted with &s;tationary perma|nent power, to enforce this &s;ort of con&s;tructive ge|neral will. What organ it is that &s;hall declare the corporate mind is &s;o much a matter of po&s;itive ar|rangement, that &s;everal &s;tates, for the validity of &s;everal of their acts, have required a proportion of voices much greater than that of a mere majority.&mdash;The&s;e proportions are &s;o entirely governed by con|vention, that in &s;ome ca&s;es the minority decides. The laws in many countries to <HI>condemn</HI> require more than a mere majority; le&s;s than an equal number to <HI>acquit.</HI> In our judicial trials we require unanimity either to condemn or to ab&s;olve. In &s;ome incor|porations one man &s;peaks for the whole; in others, a few. Until the other day, in the con&s;titution of Po|land, unanimity was required to give validity to any act of their great national council or diet. This ap|proaches much more nearly to rude nature than the in&s;titutions of any other country. Such, indeed, every commonwealth mu&s;t be, without a po&s;itive law to recognize in a certain number the will of the entire body.</P>
<P>If men di&s;&s;olve their ancient incorporation, in or|der to regenerate their community, in that &s;tate of things each man has a right, if he plea&s;es, to remain an individual. Any number of individuals, who can agree upon it, have an undoubted right to form them&s;elves into a &s;tate apart and wholly independent. If any of the&s;e is forced into the fellow&s;hip of an|other, this is conque&s;t and not compact. On every principle, which &s;uppo&s;es &s;ociety to be in virtue of a free covenant, this compul&s;ive incorporation mu&s;t be null and void.</P>
<P>As a people can have no right to a corporate ca|pacity without univer&s;al con&s;ent, &s;o neither have they
<PB N="276" REF="102">
a right to hold exclu&s;ively any lands in the name and title of a corporation. On the &s;cheme of the pre&s;ent rulers in our neighbouring country, regenerated as they are, they have no more right to the territory called France than I have. I have a right to pitch my tent in any unoccupied place I can find for it; and I may apply to my own maintenance any part of their unoccupied &s;oil. I may purcha&s;e the hou&s;e or vineyard of any individual proprietor who refu&s;es his con&s;ent (and mo&s;t proprietors have, as far as they dared, refu&s;ed it) to the new incorporation. I &s;tand in his independent place. Who are the&s;e in&s;olent men calling them&s;elves the French nation, that would monopolize this fair domain of nature? Is it becau&s;e they &s;peak a certain jargon? Is it their mode of chat|tering, to me unintelligible, that forms their title to my land? Who are they who claim by pre&s;cription and de&s;cent from certain gangs of banditti called Franks, and Burgundians, and Vi&s;igoths, of whom I may have never heard, and ninety-nine out of an hundred of them&s;elves certainly never have heard; whil&s;t at the very time they tell me, that pre&s;cription and long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion form no title to property? Who are they that pre&s;ume to a&s;&s;ert that the land which I purcha&s;ed of the individual, a natural per&s;on, and not a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">tion of &s;tate, belongs to them, who in the very capacity in which they make their claim can exi&s;t only a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> an imaginary being, and in virtue of the very pre&s;cription which they reject and di&s;own? This mode of arguing might be pu&s;hed into all the detail, &s;o as to leave no &s;ort of doubt, that on their principles, and on the &s;ort of footing on which they have thought proper to place them&s;elves, the crowd of men, on the other &s;ide of the channel, who have the impudence to call them&s;elves a people, can never be the lawful exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the &s;oil.

The intention of the &s;everal actors in the change in France, is not a matter of doubt. It is very openly profe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the modern world, before this time, there has been no in&s;tance of this &s;pirit of general political faction, &s;eparated from religion, pervading &s;everal countries, and forming a principle of union between the partizans in each. But the thing is not le&s;s in human nature. The ancient world has furni&s;hed a &s;trong and &s;triking in&s;tance of &s;uch a ground for faction, full as powerful, and full as mi&s;chievous as our &s;pirit of religious &s;y&s;tem had ever been, exciting in all the &s;tates of Greece (European and A&s;iatic) the mo&s;t violent animo&s;ities, and the mo&s;t cruel and bloody per&s;ecutions and pro&s;criptions. The&s;e an|cient factions in each commonwealth of Greece, connected them&s;elves with tho&s;e of the &s;ame de&s;crip|tion in &s;ome other States; and &s;ecret cabals and public alliances were carried on and made, not upon a conformity of general political intere&s;ts, but for the &s;upport and aggrandizement of the two leading &s;tates which headed the ari&s;tocratic and democratic factions. For, as in later times, the King of Spain was at the head of a catholic, and the King of Sweden of a prote&s;tant intere&s;t, France, (though catholic, acting &s;ubordinately to the latter,) in the like manner the Lacedemonians were every where at the head of the ari&s;tocratic intere&s;ts, and the Athenians of the demo|cratic. The two leading powers kept alive a con|&s;tant cabal and con&s;piracy in every &s;tate, and the political dogmas concerning the con&s;titution of a republic, were the great in&s;truments by which the&s;e leading States cho&s;e to aggrandize them&s;elves. Their choice was not unwi&s;e; becau&s;e the intere&s;t in opi|nions

(merely as opinions, and without any experi|mental reference to their effects) when once they take &s;trong hold of the mind, become the mo&s;t ope|rative of all intere&s;ts, and indeed very often &s;uper|cede every other.</P>
<P>I might further exemplify the po&s;&s;ibility of a poli|tical &s;entiment running through various &s;tates and combining factions in them, from the hi&s;tory of the middle ages in the Guelfs and Ghibellines. The&s;e were political factions originally in favour of the Emperor and the Pope, with no mixture of religious doginas; or if any thing religiou&s;ly doctrinal they had in them originally, it very &s;oon di&s;appeared; as their fir&s;t political objects di&s;appeared al&s;o, though the &s;pirit remained. They became no more than names to di&s;tingui&s;h factions; but they were not the le&s;s powerful in their operation, when they had no direct point of doctrine, either religious or civil, to a&s;&s;ert. For a long time, however, tho&s;e factions gave no &s;mall degree of influence to the foreign chiefs in every commonwealth in which they exi&s;ted. I do not mean to pur&s;ue further the track of the&s;e parties. I allude to this part of hi&s;tory only, as it furni&s;hes an in&s;tance of that &s;pecies of faction which broke the locality of public affections, and united de&s;criptions of citizens more with &s;trangers than with their coun|trymen of different opinions.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Memorial on tho Affairs of France in</HI> 1791.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>PROFESSORS OF ARTIFICIAL LAW. (SEE LAW.)</HEAD>
<P>THE profe&s;&s;ors of artificial law have always walked hand in hand with the profe&s;&s;ors of artificial theology.

<P>IF the two great leading Powers of Germany do not regard this danger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">French Revolution.</NOTE>, (as apparently they do not) in the light in which it pre&s;ents it&s;elf &s;o naturally, it is becau&s;e they are powers too great to have a &s;ocial intere&s;t. That &s;ort of intere&s;t belongs only to tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;tate of weakne&s;s or mediocrity is &s;uch, as to give them greater cau&s;e of apprehen&s;ion from what may de&s;troy them, than of hope from any thing by which they may be aggrandized.</P>
<P>As long as tho&s;e two Princes are at variance, &s;o long the liberties of Germany are &s;afe. But if ever they &s;hould &s;o far under&s;tand one another as to be per&s;uaded that they have a more direct and more certainly defined intere&s;t in a proportioned mutual aggrandizement than in a reciprocal reduction, that is, if they come to think that they are more likely to be enriched by a divi&s;ion of &s;poil, than to be ren|dered &s;ecure by keeping to the old policy of pre|venting
<PB N="287" REF="113">
others from being &s;poiled by either of them, from that moment the liberties of Germany are no more.</P>
<P>That a junction of two in &s;uch a &s;cheme is nei|ther impo&s;&s;ible nor improbable, is evident from the partition of Poland in 1773, which was effected by &s;uch a junction as made the interpo&s;ition of other nations to prevent it, not ea&s;y. Their circum&s;tances, at that time, hindered any other three &s;tates, or in|deed any two, from taking mea&s;ures in common to prevent it, though France was at that time an exi&s;t|ing power, and had not yet learned to act upon a &s;y&s;tem of politics of her own invention. The geo|graphical po&s;ition of Poland was a great ob&s;tacle to any movements of France in oppo&s;ition to this, at that time unparalleled league. To my certain know|ledge, if Great Britain had, at that time, been willing to concur in preventing the execution of a project &s;o dangerous in the example, even exhau&s;ted as France then was by the preceding war, and under a lazy and unenterpri&s;ing Prince, &s;he would have at every ri&s;que taken an active part in this bu&s;ine&s;s. But a languor with regard to &s;o remote an intere&s;t, and the principles and pa&s;&s;ions which were then &s;trongly at work at home, were the cau&s;es why Great Britain would not give France any encouragement in &s;uch an enterprize. At that time, however, and with regard to that object, in my opinion, Great Britain and France had a common intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But the po&s;ition of Germany is not like that of Poland, with regard to France, either for good or for evil. If a conjunction between Pru&s;&s;ia and the Emperor &s;hould be formed for the purpo&s;e of &s;ecu|lari&s;ing and rendering hereditary the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Electorates and the Bi&s;hopric of Mun&s;ter, for &s;et|tling two of them on the children of the Emperor, and uniting Cologne and Mun&s;ter to the dominions of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia on the Rhine; or if any other project of mutual aggrandizement &s;hould be in pro&s;|pect,

Every thing is referred to the production of force; afterwards every thing is tru&s;ted to the u&s;e of it. It is military in its principle, in its maxims, in its &s;pirit, and in all its movements. The &s;tate has dominion and conque&s;t for its &s;ole objects; dominion over minds by pro&s;elyti&s;m, over bodies by arms.</P>
<P>Thus con&s;tituted with an immen&s;e body of natural means, which are le&s;&s;ened in their amount only to be increa&s;ed in their effect, France has &s;ince the accom|pli&s;hment of the revolution, a complete unity in its direction. It has de&s;troyed every re&s;ource of the &s;tate, which depends upon opinion and the good will of individuals. The riches of convention di&s;appear. The advantages of nature in &s;ome con&s;iderable mea|&s;ure remain; the command over them is complete and ab&s;olute. We go about a&s;king when a&s;&s;ignats will expire, and laugh at the la&s;t price of them: but what &s;ignifies the fate of the&s;e tickets of de&s;poti&s;m?
<PB N="296" REF="122">
The de&s;poti&s;m will find de&s;potic means of &s;upply. They have found the &s;hort cut to the productions of Nature, while others in pur&s;uit of them are obliged to wind through the labyrinth of artificial &s;ociety. They &s;eize upon the fruit of the labour; they &s;eize upon the labourer him&s;elf. The natural means of France are &s;till great. They are very materially le&s;|&s;ened, I admit; but the power over them is increa&s;ed. Were France but half what it is in population, in compactne&s;s, in applicability of its force, &s;ituated as it is, and being what it is, it would be too &s;trong for mo&s;t of the States of Europe, con&s;tituted as they are, and proceeding as they proceed. Would it be wi&s;e to e&s;timate what the world of Europe, as well as the world of A&s;ia, had to dread from Jinghiz Khan, upon a contemplation of the re&s;ources of the cold and bar|ren &s;pot in the remote&s;t Tartary, from whence fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued that &s;courge of the human race? Ought we to judge from the exci&s;e and &s;tamp duties of the rocks, or from the paper circulation of the &s;ands of Arabia, the power by which Mahomet and his tribes laid hold at once on the two mo&s;t powerful empires of the world; beat one of them totally to the ground, broke to pieces the other, and, in not much longer &s;pace of time than I have lived, overturned governments, laws, manners, religion, and extended an empire from In|dus to the Pyrennees.</P>
<P>Material re&s;ources never have &s;upplied, nor ever can &s;upply the want of unity in de&s;ign and con&s;tancy in pur&s;uit. But unity in de&s;ign, and per&s;everance, and boldne&s;s in pur&s;uit, have never wanted re&s;ources, and never will. We have not con&s;idered as we ought the dreadful energy of a State, in which the property has nothing to do with the Government. Reflect, my dear Sir, reflect again and again on a Government, in which the property is in &s;ubjection, and where nothing rules but the minds of de&s;perate men.

The di&s;covery is dreadful, the mine exhau&s;tle&s;s. They have every thing to gain, and they have nothing to lo&s;e.

In the &s;table fundamental parts of our con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ution we made no revolution; no, nor any alteration at all. We did not impair the monarchy.

<P>The church was not impaired. Her e&s;tates, her maje&s;ty, her &s;plendor, her orders and gradations continued the &s;ame.

<HEAD>REVOLUTION, (FRENCH.) Partizans of the French Sy&s;tem.</HEAD>
<P>THIS &s;y&s;tem, (the French) as it has been fir&s;t realized, dogmatically, as well as practically, in France, makes France the natural head of all fac|tious formed on a &s;imilar principle, whenever they may prevail, as much as Athens was the head and &s;ettled ally of all democratic factions, wherever they exi&s;ted.

<P>This &s;y&s;tem has very many partizans in every country in Europe, but particularly in England, where they are already formed into a body, compre|hending mo&s;t of the di&s;&s;enters of the three leading denominations; to the&s;e are readily aggregated all who are di&s;&s;enters in character, temper, and di&s;po&s;i|tion, though not belonging to any of their congrega|tions&mdash;that is, all the re&s;tle&s;s people who re&s;emble them, of all ranks and all parties&mdash;whigs, and even

The&s;e latter have united them&s;elves into one great, and in my opinion, formidable club<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Originally called the Bengal club, but &s;ince opened to per&s;ons from the other pre&s;idencies, for the purpo&s;e of con&s;olidating the whole Indian intere&s;t.</NOTE>, which, though now quiet, may be brought into action with con&s;ider|able unanimity and force.</P>
<P>Formerly few, except the ambitious great, or the de&s;perate and indigent, were to be feared as in&s;tru|ments in revolutions. What has happened in France teaches us, with many other things, that there are more cau&s;es than have commonly been taken into our con&s;ideration, by which government may be &s;ub|verted. The monied men, merchants, principal trade&s;men, and men of letters (hitherto generally thought the peaceable and even timid part of &s;ociety) are the chief actors in the French Revolution. But the fact is, that as money increa&s;es and circulates, and as the circulation of news, in politics and letters, becomes more and more diffu&s;ed, the per&s;ons who diffu&s;e this money, and this intelligence, become more and more important. This was not long un|di&s;covered. Views of <HI>ambition</HI> were in France, for the fir&s;t time, pre&s;ented to the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of men. Objects in the &s;tate, in the army, in the &s;y&s;tem of civil offices of every kind. Their eyes were dazzled with this new pro&s;pect. They were, as it were, electrified and made to lo&s;e the natural &s;pirit of their &s;ituation. A bribe, great without example in the hi&s;tory of the world, was held out to them&mdash;the whole government of a very large kingdom.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal who are per&s;uaded that the &s;ame thing cannot happen in England, becau&s;e here, (they
<PB N="303" REF="129">
&s;ay) the occupations of merchants, trade&s;men, and manufacturers, are not held as degrading &s;ituations. I once thought that the low e&s;timation in which com|merce was held in France, might be reckoned among the cau&s;es of the late revolution; and I am &s;till of opinion, that the exclu&s;ive &s;pirit of the French no|bility, did irritate the wealthy of other cla&s;&s;es. But I found long &s;ince, that per&s;ons in trade and bu&s;ine&s;s were by no means de&s;pi&s;ed in France in the manner I had been taught to believe. As to men of letters, they were &s;o far from being de&s;pi&s;ed or neglected, that there was no country perhaps in the univer&s;e, in which they were &s;o highly e&s;teemed, courted, ca|re&s;&s;ed, and even feared; trade&s;men naturally were not &s;o much &s;ought in &s;ociety (as not furni&s;hing &s;o largely to the fund of conver&s;ation as they do to the revenues of the &s;tate) but the latter de&s;cription got forward every day. M. Bailly, who made him&s;elf the popular mayor on the rebellion of the Ba&s;tile, and is a pricipal actor in the revolt, before the change po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a pen&s;ion or office under the crown, of &s;ix hundred pound Engli&s;h, a year, for that country, no contemptible provi&s;ion: And this he obtained &s;olely as a man of letters, and on no other title. As to the monied men&mdash;whil&s;t the monarchy continued, there is no doubt, that merely as &s;uch, they did not enjoy the <HI>privileges</HI> of nobility, but nobility was of &s;o ea&s;y an acqui&s;ition, that it was the fault or neglect of all of that de&s;cription, who did not obtain its pri|vileges, for their lives at lea&s;t in virtue of office. It attached under the royal government to an innu|merable multitude of places, real and nominal, that were vendible; and &s;uch nobility were as capable of every thing as their degree of influence or intere&s;t could make them, that is, as nobility of no con&s;ider|able rank or con&s;equence. M. Neckar, &s;o far from being a French gentleman, was not &s;o much as a Frenchman born, and yet we all know the rank in
<PB N="304" REF="130">
which he &s;tood on the day of the meeting of the &s;tates.</P>
<P>As to the mere matter of e&s;timation of the mer|cantile or any other cla&s;s, this is regulated by opi|nion and prejudice. In England a &s;ecurity again&s;t the envy of men in the&s;e cla&s;&s;es, is not &s;o very com|plete as we may imagine. We mu&s;t not impo&s;e upon our&s;elves. What in&s;titutions and manners together had done in France, manners alone do here. It is the natural operation of things where there exi&s;ts a crown, a court, &s;plendid orders of knighthood, and an hereditary nobility;&mdash;where there exi&s;ts a fixed, permanent, landed gentry, continued in greatne&s;s and opulence by the law of primogeniture, and by a protection given to family &s;ettlements; where there exi&s;ts a &s;tanding army and navy;&mdash;where there exi&s;ts a church e&s;tabli&s;hment, which be&s;tows on learning and parts an intere&s;t combined with that of religion and the &s;tate;&mdash;in a country where &s;uch things exi&s;t, wealth, new in it's acqui&s;ition, and precarious in it's duration, can never rank fir&s;t, or even near the fir&s;t; though wealth has it's natural weight, further, than as it is balanced and even preponderated among&s;t us as among&s;t other nations, by artificial in&s;titutions and opinions growing out of them. At no period in the hi&s;tory of England have &s;o few peers been taken out of trade or from families newly created by com|merce. In no period has &s;o &s;mall a number of noble families entered into the counting-hou&s;e. I can call to mind but one in all England, and his is of near fifty years &s;tanding. Be that as it may, it appears plain to me from my be&s;t ob&s;ervation, that envy and ambition may by art, management and di&s;po&s;ition, be as much excited among&s;t the&s;e de&s;criptions of men in England, as in any other country; and that they are ju&s;t as capable of acting a part in any great change.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Memorial on the Affairs of France in</HI> 1791.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>REVOLUTION. Policy at the Revolution, different Sy&s;tem pur&s;ued for &s;ome Years pa&s;t. (See KING'S MEN, CABINET (DOUBLE.)</HEAD>
<P>AT the revolution, the crown, deprived, for the ends of the revolution it&s;elf, of many prerogatives, was found too weak to &s;truggle again&s;t all the diffi|culties which pre&s;&s;ed &s;o new and un&s;ettled a govern|ment. The court was obliged therefore to delegate a part of its powers to men of &s;uch intere&s;t as could &s;upport, and of &s;uch fidelity as would adhere to, its e&s;tabli&s;hment. Such men were able to draw in a greater number to a concurrence in the common defence. This connection, nece&s;&s;ary at fir&s;t, con|tinued long after convenient; and properly conducted might indeed, in all &s;ituations, be an u&s;eful in&s;tru|ment of government. At the &s;ame time, through the intervention of men of popular weight and cha|racter, the people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;ecurity for their ju&s;t portion of importance in the &s;tate. But as the title to the crown grew &s;tronger by long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and by the con&s;tant increa&s;e of its influence, the&s;e helps have of late &s;eemed to certain per&s;ons no better than incumbrances. The powerful managers for govern|ment were not &s;ufficiently &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the plea&s;ure of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of immediate and per&s;onal favour, &s;ometimes from a confidence in their own &s;trength, natural and acquired; &s;ometimes from a fear of of|fending their friends, and weakening that lead in the country, which gave them a con&s;ideration indepen|dent of the court. Men acted as if the court could receive, as well as confer, an obligation. The in|fluence of government, thus divided in appearance between the court and the leaders of parties, became in many ca&s;es an acce&s;&s;ion rather to the popular than to the royal &s;cale; and &s;ome part of that influence which would otherwi&s;e have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as in a &s;ort of mortmain and unalienable domain, returned again to the great ocean from whence it aro&s;e, and
<PB N="306" REF="132">
circulated among the people. This method, there|fore, of governing, by men of great natural intere&s;t, or great acquired con&s;ideration, was viewed in a very invidious light by the true lovers of ab&s;olute mo|narchy. It is the nature of de&s;poti&s;m to abhor power held by any means but its own momentary plea&s;ure; and to annihilate all intermediate &s;ituations between boundle&s;s &s;trength on its own part, and total debility on the part of the people.</P>
<P>To get rid of all this intermediate and indepen|dant importance, and <HI>to &s;ecure to the court the unli|mited and uncontrouled u&s;e of its own va&s;t influence, under the &s;ole direction of its own private favour,</HI> has for &s;ome years pa&s;t been the great object of policy. If this were compa&s;&s;ed, the influence of the crown mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, produce all the effects which the mo&s;t &s;anguine partizans of the court could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire. Government might then be carried on with|out any concurrence on the part of the peeple; without any attention to the dignity of the greater, or to the affections of the lower &s;orts. A new project was therefore devi&s;ed, by a certain &s;et of in|triguing men, totally different from the &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration which had prevailed &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick. This project, I have heard, was fir&s;t conceived by &s;ome per&s;ons in the court of Frederick Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>The earlie&s;t attempt in the execution of this de|&s;ign was to &s;et up for mini&s;ter, a per&s;on, in rank in|deed re&s;pectable, and very ample in fortune; but who, to the moment of this va&s;t and &s;udden eleva|tion, was little known or con&s;idered in the kingdom. To him the whole nation was to yield an immediate and implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But whether it was for want of firmne&s;s to bear up again&s;t the fir&s;t oppo&s;i|tion; or that things were not yet fully ripened, or that this method was not found the mo&s;t eligible; that idea was &s;oon abandoned. The in&s;trumental part of the project was a little altered, to accommo|date
<PB N="307" REF="133">
it to the time, and to bring things more gradu|ally and more &s;urely to the one great end propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of the reformed plan was to draw <HI>a line which &s;hould &s;eparate the court from the mini&s;try.</HI> Hitherto the&s;e names had been looked upon as &s;y|nonymous; but for the future, court and admini&s;tra|tion were to be con&s;idered as things totally di&s;tinct. By this operation, two &s;y&s;tems of admini&s;tration were to be formed; one which &s;hould be in the real &s;ecret and confidence; the other merely o&s;ten&s;ible, to per|form the official and executory duties of govern|ment. The latter were alone to be re&s;pon&s;ible; whil&s;t the real advi&s;ers, who enjoyed all the power, were effectually removed from all the danger.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>A party under the&s;e leaders was to be formed in favour of the court again&s;t the mini&s;try:</HI> this party was to have a large &s;hare in the emoluments of government, and to hold it totally &s;eparate from, and independent of, o&s;ten&s;ible admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>The third point, and that on which the &s;ucce&s;s of the whole &s;cheme ultimately depended, was <HI>to bring parliament to an acquie&s;cence in this project.</HI> Parliament was therefore to be taught, by degrees, a total indifference to the per&s;ons, rank, influence, abilities, connexions, and character, of the mini&s;ters of the crown. By means of a di&s;cipline, on which I &s;hall &s;ay more hereafter, that body was to be ha|bituated to the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts, and the mo&s;t di&s;cordant politics. All connexions and dependen|cies among &s;ubjects were to be entirely di&s;&s;olved. As hitherto bu&s;ine&s;s had gone through the hands of leaders of Whigs or Tories, men of talents to con|ciliate the people, and engage to their confidence, now the method was to be altered; and the lead was to be given to men of no &s;ort of con&s;ideration or credit in the country. This want of natural import|ance was to be their very title to delegated power. Members of parliament were to be hardened into an
<PB N="308" REF="134">
in&s;en&s;ibility to pride as well as to duty. Tho&s;e high and haughty &s;entiments, which are the great &s;upport of independence, were to be let down gradually. Point of honour and precedence were no more to be regarded in parliamentary decorum, than in a Turki&s;h army. It was to be avowed as a con&s;titu|tional maxim, that the king might appoint one of his footmen, or one of your footmen, for mini&s;ter; and that he ought to be, and that he would be, as well followed as the fir&s;t name for rank or wi&s;dom in the nation. Thus parliament was to look on, as if per|fectly unconcerned, while a cabal of the clo&s;et and back-&s;tairs was &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of a national admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>With &s;uch a degree of acquie&s;cence, any mea&s;ure of any court might well be deemed thoroughly &s;e|cure. The capital objects, and by much the mo&s;t flattering characteri&s;tics of arbitrary power, would be obtained. Every thing would be drawn from its holdings in the country to the per&s;onal favour and inclination of the prince. This favour would be the &s;ole introduction to power, and the only tenure by which it was to be held: &s;o that no per&s;on look|ing towards another, and all looking towards the court, it was impo&s;&s;ible but that the motive which &s;olely influenced every man's hopes mu&s;t come in time to govern every man's conduct; till at la&s;t the &s;ervility became univer&s;al, in &s;pite of the dead letter of any laws or in&s;titutions what&s;oever.</P>

<HEAD>REPUBLICS (ANCIENT.) The old Republican Legi&s;lators followed, with a &s;olicitous accuracy, the moral Conditions and Properties of Men.</HEAD>
<P>THE legi&s;lators who framed the antient republics knew that their bu&s;ine&s;s was too arduous to be accom|pli&s;hed with no better apparatus than the metaphy&s;ics of an under-graduate, and the mathematics and arith|metic of an exci&s;eman. They had to do with men, and they were obliged to &s;tudy human nature. They had to do with citizens, and they were obliged to &s;tudy the effects of tho&s;e habits which are commu|nicated by the circum&s;tances of civil life. They were &s;en&s;ible that the operation of this &s;econd nature on the fir&s;t produced a new combination; and thence aro&s;e many diver&s;ities among&s;t men, according to their birth, their education, their profe&s;&s;ions, the periods of their lives, their re&s;idence in towns or in the country, their &s;everal ways of acquiring and of fixing property, and according to the quality of the property it&s;elf, all which rendered them as it were &s;o many different &s;pecies of animals. From hence they thought them&s;elves obliged to di&s;po&s;e their citizens into &s;uch cla&s;&s;es, and to place them in &s;uch &s;ituations in the &s;tate as their peculiar habits might qualify them to fill, and to allot to them &s;uch appropriated privi|leges as might &s;ecure to them what their &s;pecific occa&s;ions required, and which might furni&s;h to each de&s;cription &s;uch force as might protect it in the con|flict cau&s;ed by the diver&s;ity of intere&s;ts, that mu&s;t exi&s;t, and mu&s;t contend in all complex &s;ociety: for the legi&s;lator would have been a&s;hamed, that the coar&s;e hu&s;bandman &s;hould well know how to a&s;&s;ort and to u&s;e his &s;heep, hor&s;es, and oxen, and &s;hould have enough of common &s;en&s;e not to ab&s;tract and equalize them all into animals, without providing for each kind an appropriate food, care, and employment; whil&s;t he, the oeconomi&s;t, di&s;po&s;er, and &s;hepherd of his own kindred, &s;ubliming him&s;elf into an airy metaphy&s;ician,

was re&s;olved to know nothing of his flocks but as men in general. It is for this rea&s;on that Monte&s;quien ob|&s;erved very ju&s;tly, that in their cla&s;&s;ification of the citizens, the great legi&s;lators of antiquity made the greate&s;t di&s;play of their powers, and even &s;oared above them&s;elves.

As the fir&s;t &s;ort of legi&s;lators attended to the different kinds of citizens, and combined them into one commonwealth, the others, the metaphy&s;ical and alchemi&s;tical legi&s;lators, (French) have taken the direct contrary cour&s;e. They have attempted to confound all &s;orts of citizens, as well as they could, into one homogeneous ma&s;s; and then they divided th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> their amalgama into a number of incoherent republics. They reduce men to loo&s;e counters merely for the &s;ake of &s;imple telling, and not to figures who&s;e power is to ari&s;e from their place in the table. The elements of their own metaphy&s;ics might have taught them better le&s;&s;ons.

<P>So far from this able di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome of the old republican legi&s;lators, which follows with a &s;olicitous accuracy, the moral conditions and propen&s;ities of men, they have levelled and cru&s;hed together all the orders which they found, even under the coar&s;e unar|tificial arrangement of the monarchy, in which mode of government the cla&s;&s;ing of the citizens is not of &s;o much importance as in a republic. It is true, how|ever, that every &s;uch cla&s;&s;ification, if properly or|dered,

is good in all forms of government; and compo&s;es a &s;trong barrier again&s;t the exce&s;&s;es of de|&s;poti&s;m, as well as it is the nece&s;&s;ary means of giving effect and permanence to a republic. For want of &s;omething of this kind, if the pre&s;ent project of a republic &s;hould fail, all &s;ecurities to a moderated free|dom fail along with it; all the indirect re&s;traints which mitigate de&s;poti&s;m are removed; in&s;omuch that if monarchy &s;hould ever again obtain an entire a&s;cen|dancy in France, under this or under any other dy|na&s;ty, it will probably be, if not voluntarily tem|pered at letting out, by the wi&s;e and virtuous coun&s;els of the prince, the mo&s;t completely arbitrary power that has ever appeared on earth. This is to play a mo&s;t de&s;perate game.</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion, which attends on all &s;uch proceed|ings, they even declare to be one of their objects, and they hope to &s;ecure their con&s;titution by a terror of a return of tho&s;e evils which attended their making it. <Q REND="inline">"By this,"</Q> &s;ay they,

<HEAD>REFORMATION. Its Effects. (See REVOLUTION (FRENCH) RELIGION, POLITICS, NEW SYSTEM.)</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t revolution of doctrine and theory which has happened in Europe, is the Reformation. It is not for my purpo&s;e to take any notice here of the merits of that Revolution, but to &s;tate one only of it's effects.</P>
<P>That effect was <HI>to introduce other intere&s;ts into all countries, than tho&s;e which aro&s;e from their locality and natural circum&s;tances.</HI> The principle of the Refor|mation was &s;uch, as by it's e&s;&s;ence, could not be local or confined to the country in which it had it's origin. For in&s;tance, the doctrine of <Q REND="inline">"Ju&s;ti|fication by Faith or by Works,"</Q> which was the ori|ginal ba&s;is of the Reformation, could not have one of it's alternatives true as to Germany, and fal&s;e as to every other country. Neither are que&s;tions of true and theoretic fal&s;ehood, governed by circum|&s;tances, any more than by places. On that occa&s;ion, therefore, the &s;pirit of pro&s;elyti&s;m expanded it&s;elf with great ela&s;ticity upon all &s;ides, and great divi|&s;ions were every where the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>The&s;e divi&s;ions, however, in appearance merely dogmatic, &s;oon became mixed with political; and their effects were rendered much more inten&s;e from this combination. Europe was, for a long time, di|vided into two great factions, under the name of Catholic and Prote&s;tant, which not only often alie|nated &s;tate from &s;tate, but al&s;o divided almo&s;t every
<PB N="321" REF="147">
&s;tate within it&s;elf. The warm parties in each &s;tate were more affectionately attached to tho&s;e of their own doctrinal intere&s;t in &s;ome other country than to their fellow-citizens, or to their natural government, when they, or either of them, happened to be of a different per&s;ua&s;ion. The&s;e factions, whenever they prevailed, if they did not ab&s;olutely de&s;troy, at lea&s;t weakened and di&s;tracted the locality of patrioti&s;m, the public affections came to have other motives and other ties.</P>
<P>Although the principles to which it gave ri&s;e, did not operate with a perfect regularity and con&s;tancy, they never wholly cea&s;ed to operate. Few wars were made, and few treaties were entered into in which they did not come in for &s;ome part. They gave a colour, a character, and direction to all the politics of Europe.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Memorial on the Affairs of France in</HI> 1791.</BIBL></P>

The&s;e circum&s;tances are &s;ufficient almo&s;t to level their condition to that of the unhappy majo|rity; but there are other circum&s;tances which place them in a far lower condition. Not only their under|&s;tandings labour continually, which is the &s;evere&s;t labour, but their hearts are torn by the wor&s;t, mo&s;t trouble&s;ome, and in&s;atiable of all pa&s;&s;ions, by ava|rice, by ambition, by fear, and jealou&s;y. No part of the mind has re&s;t. Power gradually extirpates from the mind every humane and gentle virtue. Pity, benevolence, friend&s;hip, are things almo&s;t unknown in high &s;tations. <HI>Veroe amicitioe rari&s;&s;ime inveniuntur in iis qui i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> honoribus reque publica ver&s;antur,</HI> &s;ays Cicero. And indeed, courts are the &s;chools where cruelty, pride, di&s;&s;imulation and treachery are &s;tudied and taught in the mo&s;t vicious perfection. This is a point &s;o clear and acknowledged, that if it did not make a nece&s;&s;ary part of my &s;ubject, I &s;hould pa&s;s it by entirely. And this has hindered me from draw|ing at full length, and in the mo&s;t &s;triking colours, this &s;hocking picture of the degeneracy and wretch|edne&s;s of human nature, in that part which is vul|garly thought its happie&s;t and mo&s;t amiable &s;tate.&mdash;You know from what originals I could copy &s;uch pictures.

<P>Let us now view the other &s;pecies of the rich, tho&s;e who devote their time and fortunes to idlene&s;s and plea&s;ure. How much happier are they? The plea|&s;ures which are agreeable to nature are within the reach of all, and therefore can form no di&s;tinction in favour of the rich. The plea&s;ures which art forces

up are &s;eldom &s;incere, and never &s;atisfying. What is wor&s;e, this con&s;tant application to plea&s;ure takes away from the enjoyment, or rather turns it into the nature of a very burthen&s;ome and laborious bu&s;ine&s;s. It has con&s;equences much more fatal. It produces a weak valetudinary &s;tate of body, attended by all tho&s;e horrid di&s;orders, and yet more horrid methods of cure, which are the re&s;ult of luxury on one hand, and the weak and ridiculous efforts of human art on the other. The plea&s;ures of &s;uch men are &s;carcely felt as plea&s;ures; at the &s;ame time that they bring on pains and di&s;ea&s;es, which are felt but too &s;everely. The mind has its &s;hare of the misfortune; it grows lazy and enervate, unwilling and unable to &s;earch for truth, and utterly uncapable of knowing, much le&s;s of reli&s;hing real happine&s;s. The poor by their ex|ce&s;&s;ive labour, and the rich by their enormous luxury, are &s;et upon a level, and rendered equally ignorant of any knowledge which might conduce to their hap|pine&s;s.

<P>FAR am I from denying in theory, full as far is my heart from withholding in practice, (if I were of power to give or to withhold) the <HI>real</HI> rights of men. In denying their fal&s;e claims of right, I do not mean to injure tho&s;e which are real, and are &s;uch as their pretended rights would totally de&s;troy. If civil &s;o|ciety be made for the advantage of man, all the ad|vantages for which it is made become his right. It is an in&s;titution of beneficence; and law it&s;elf is only beneficence acting by a rule. Men have a right to live by that rule; they have a right to ju&s;tice; as be|tween their fellows, whether their fellows are in po|litic function or in ordinary occupation. They have a right to the fruits of their indu&s;try; and to the means of making their indu&s;try fruitful. They have a right to the acqui&s;itions of their parents; to the nouri&s;hment and improvement of their offspring; to in&s;truction in life, and to con&s;olation in death. Whatever each man can &s;eparately do, without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon others, he has a right to do for him&s;elf; and he has a right to a fair portion of all which &s;ociety, with all
<PB N="332" REF="158">
its combinations of &s;kill and force, can do in his fa|vour. In this partner&s;hip all men have equal rights; but not to equal things. He that has but five &s;hil|lings in the partner&s;hip, has as good a right to it, as he that has five hundred pounds has to his larger pro|portion. But he has not a right to an equal dividend in the product of the joint &s;tock; and as to the &s;hare of power, authority, and direction which each indi|vidual ought to have in the management of the &s;tate, that I mu&s;t deny to be among&s;t the direct original rights of man in civil &s;ociety; for I have in my con|templation the civil &s;ocial man, and no other.

<HEAD>RIGHTS OF MAN, (THE OBJECT OF.)</HEAD>
<P>THE political dogma, which upon the new French &s;y&s;tem, is to unite the factions of different nations, turns on this,
<Q REND="inline">"That the majority told, by the head, of the taxable people in every country, is the per|petual, natural, uncea&s;ing, indefea&s;ible &s;overeign; that this majority is perfectly ma&s;ter of the form, as well as the admini&s;tration of the &s;tate, and that the magi&s;trates, under whatever names they are called, are only functionaries to obey the orders, (general as laws or particular as decrees) which that majority may make; that this is the only na|tural government; that all others are tyranny and u&s;urpation."</Q></P>
<P>In order to reduce this dogma into practice, the republicans in France, and their a&s;&s;ociates in other countries, make it always their bu&s;ine&s;s, and often their public profe&s;&s;ion, to de&s;troy all traces of antient e&s;tabli&s;hments, and to form a new commonwealth in each country, upon the ba&s;is of the French <HI>Rights of Men.</HI> On the principle of the&s;e rights, they mean to in&s;titute in every country, and as it were, the germ of the whole, parochial governments, for the

purpo&s;e of what they call equal repre&s;entation. From them is to grow, by &s;ome media, a general council and repre&s;entative of all the parochial governments.

<P>Knowing how oppo&s;ite a permanent landed intere&s;t is to that &s;cheme, they have re&s;olved, and it is the great drift of all their regulations, to reduce that de|&s;cription of men to a mere pea&s;antry, for the &s;u&s;te|nance of the towns, and to place the true effective government in cities, among the trade&s;men, bankers, and voluntary clubs of bold, pre&s;uming young per|&s;ons;&mdash;advocates, attornies, notaries, managers of new&s;papers, and tho&s;e cabals of literary men, called academies.

But if they fail, in any degree, in the titles which they make on the principles of antiquaries and law|yers, they retreat into the citadel of the rights of men. There they find that men are equal; and the earth, the kind and equal mother of all, ought not to be monopolized to fo&s;ter the pride and luxury of any men, who by nature are no better than them&s;elves, and who, if they do not labour for their bread, are wor&s;e. They find, that by the laws of nature the oc|cupant and &s;ubduer of the &s;oil is the true proprietor; that there is no pre&s;cription again&s;t nature; and that the agreements (where any there are) which have been made with their landlords, during the time of &s;lavery, are only the effect of dure&s;&s;e and force; and that when the people re-entered into the rights of men, tho&s;e agreements were made as void as every thing el&s;e which had been &s;ettled under the prevalence of the old feudal and ari&s;tocratic tyranny. They will tell you that they &s;ee no difference between an idler with a hat and a national cockade, and an idler in a cowl or in a rochet.

As to the title by &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, they will tell you, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who have cultivated the &s;oil is the true pedigree of property, and not rotten parchments and &s;illy &s;ub&s;ti|tutions; that the lords have enjoyed their u&s;urpation too long; and that if they allow to the&s;e lay monks any charitable pen&s;ion, they ought to be thankful to the bounty of the true proprietor, who is &s;o generous towards a fal&s;e claimant to his goods.</P>

Ma&s;&s;acres only increa&s;e the ferocity of men, and teach them to regard their own lives and tho&s;e of others as of little value; whereas the great policy of government is to teach the people to think both of great importance in the eyes of God and the State, and never to be &s;acrificed or even hazarded to gra|tify their pa&s;&s;ions, or for any thing but the duties pre&s;cribed by the rules of morality, and under the direction of public law and public authority. To puni&s;h them with le&s;&s;er penalties would be to debili|tate the commonwealth, and make the nation mi&s;er|able, which it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of government to render happy and flouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>As to crimes too, I would draw a &s;trong line of limitation. For no one offence, <HI>politically an offence of rebellion,</HI> by council, contrivance, per&s;ua&s;ion, or compul&s;ion, for none properly a <HI>military offence of rebellion,</HI> or any thing done by open ho&s;tility in the field, &s;hould any man at all be called in que&s;tion; becau&s;e &s;uch &s;eems to be the proper and natural death of civil di&s;&s;entions. The offences of war are obli|terated by peace.</P>
<P>Another cla&s;s will of cour&s;e be included in the indemnity, namely, all tho&s;e who by their activity in re&s;toring lawful Government &s;hall obliterate their offences. The offence previou&s;ly known, the ac|ceptance of &s;ervice is a pardon for crimes. I fear that this cla&s;s of men will not be very numerous.</P>
<P>So far as to indemnity. But where are the objects of ju&s;tice, and of example, and of future &s;ecurity to the public peace? They are naturally pointed out, not by their having outraged political and civil laws, nor their having rebelled again&s;t the &s;tate, as a State,
<PB N="344" REF="170">
but by their having rebelled again&s;t the law of na|ture, and outraged man, as man. In this li&s;t, all the regicides in general, all tho&s;e who laid &s;acrilegious hands on the King, who, without any thing in their own rebellious mi&s;&s;ion to the convention to ju&s;tify them, brought him to his trial, and unanimou&s;ly voted him guilty; all tho&s;e who had a &s;hare in the cruel murder of the Queen, and the dete&s;table proceed|ings with regard to the young King, and the unhappy Prince&s;&s;es; all tho&s;e who committed cold-blooded murder any where, and particularly in their revolu|tionary tribunals, where every idea of natural ju&s;tice and of their own declared Rights of Man, have been trod under foot with the mo&s;t in&s;olent mockery; all men concerned in the burning and demolition of hou&s;es or churches, with audacious and marked acts of &s;acrilege and &s;corns offered to religion; in general, all the leaders of Jacobin clubs; not one of the&s;e &s;hould e&s;cape a puni&s;hment &s;uitable to the nature, quality, and degree of their offence, by a &s;teady but a mea&s;ured ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, no man ought to be &s;ubject to any penalty, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, but by a trial according to the cour&s;e of law, carried on with all that caution and deliberation which has been u&s;ed in the be&s;t times and precedents of the French juri&s;prudence, the criminal law of which country, faulty to be &s;ure in &s;ome particulars, was highly laudable and tender of the lives of men. In re&s;tor|ing order and ju&s;tice, every thing like retaliation ought to be religiou&s;ly avoided; and an example ought to be &s;et of a total alienation from the Jacobin proceedings in their accur&s;ed revolutionary tribunals. Every thing like lumping men in ma&s;&s;es, and of forming tables of pro&s;cription ought to be avoided.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e puni&s;hments, any thing which can be alledged in mitigation of the offence &s;hould be fully con&s;idered. Mercy is not a thing oppo&s;ed to ju&s;tice. It is an e&s;&s;ential part of it; as nece&s;&s;ary in criminal
<PB N="345" REF="171">
ca&s;es, as in civil affairs equity is to law. It is only for the Jacobins never to pardon. They have not done it in a &s;ingle in&s;tance. A council of mercy ought therefore to be appointed, with powers to re|port on each ca&s;e, to &s;often the penalty, or entirely to remit it, according to circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>With the&s;e precautions, the very fir&s;t foundation of &s;ettlement mu&s;t be to call to a &s;trict account tho&s;e bloody and mercile&s;s offenders. Without it govern|ment cannot &s;tand a year. People little con&s;ider the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of getting tho&s;e who having emerged from very low, &s;ome from the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, have exerci&s;ed a power &s;o high, and with &s;uch unrelenting and bloody a rage, quietly to fall back into their old ranks, and become humble, peaceable, laborious, and u&s;eful members of &s;ociety. It never can be. On the other hand, is it to be believed, that any worthy and virtuous &s;ubject, re|&s;tored to the ruins of his hou&s;e, will, with patience, &s;ee the cold-blooded murderer of his father, mother, wife, or children, or, perhaps, all of the&s;e relations (&s;uch things have been) no&s;e him in his own village, and in&s;ult him with the riches acquired from the plunder of his goods, ready again to head a Jacobin faction to attack his life? He is unworthy of the name of man who would &s;uffer it. It is unworthy of the name of a government, which taking ju&s;tice out of the private hand, will not exerci&s;e it for the injured by the public arm.</P>
<P>I know it &s;ounds plau&s;ible, and is readily adopted by tho&s;e who have little &s;ympathy with the &s;ufferings of others, who wi&s;h to jumble the innocent and guilty into one ma&s;s, by a general indemnity. This cruel indifference dignifies it&s;elf with the name of humanity.</P>
<P>It is extraordinary that as the wicked arts of this regicide and tyrannous faction increa&s;e in number, variety, and atrocity, the de&s;ire of puni&s;hing them becomes more and more faint, and the talk of an
<PB N="346" REF="172">
indemnity towards them, every day &s;tronger and &s;tronger. Our ideas of ju&s;tice appear to be fairly conquered and overpowered by guilt when it is grown gigantic. It is not the point of view in which we are in the habit of viewing guilt. The crimes we every day puni&s;h, are really below the penalties we inflict. The criminals are ob&s;cure and feeble. This is the view in which we &s;ee ordinary crimes and cri|minals. But when guilt is &s;een, though but for a time, to be furni&s;hed with the arms, and to be in|ve&s;ted with the robes of power, it &s;eems to a&s;&s;ume another nature, and to get, as it were, out of our juri&s;diction. This I fear is the ca&s;e with many. But there is another cau&s;e full as powerful towards this &s;ecurity to enormous guilt, the de&s;ire which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es people who have once obtained power, to enjoy it at their ca&s;e. It is not humanity, but lazine&s;s and inertne&s;s of mind which produces the de&s;ire of this kind of indemnities. This de&s;cription of men, love general and &s;hort methods. If they puni&s;h, they make a promi&s;cuous ma&s;&s;acre; if they &s;pare, they make a general act of oblivion. This is a want of di&s;po&s;ition to proceed laboriou&s;ly according to the ca&s;es, and according to the rules and principles of ju&s;tice on each ca&s;e; a want of di&s;po&s;ition to a&s;&s;ort criminals, to di&s;criminate the degrees and modes of guilt, to &s;eparate accomplices from principals, leaders from followers, &s;educers from the &s;educed, and then by following the &s;ame principles in the &s;ame detail, to cla&s;s puni&s;hments, and to &s;it them to the nature and kind of the delinquency. If that were once attempted, we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee that the ta&s;k was neither infinite, nor the execution cruel. There would be deaths, but for the number of criminals, and the extent of France, not many. There would be ca&s;es of tran|&s;portation; ca&s;es of labour to re&s;tore what has been wickedly de&s;troyed; ca&s;es of impri&s;onment, and ca&s;es of mere exile. But be this as it may, I am &s;ure that if ju&s;tice is not done there, there can be
<PB N="347" REF="173">
neither peace or ju&s;tice there, nor in any part of Europe.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory is re&s;orted to for other acts of indemnity in other times. The Princes are de&s;ired to look back to Henry the Fourth. We are de&s;ired to look to the re&s;toration of king Charles. The&s;e things, in my opinion, have no re&s;emblance what&s;oever. They were ca&s;es of a civil war; in France more ferocious, in England more moderate than common. In neither country were the orders of &s;ociety &s;ubverted; re|ligion and morality de&s;troyed on principle, or pro|perty totally annihilated. In England the govern|ment of Cromwell was to be &s;ure &s;omewhat rigid, but for a new power, no &s;avage tyranny. The country was nearly as well in his hands as in tho&s;e of Charles the Second, and in &s;ome points much better. The laws in general had their cour&s;e, and were ad|mirably admini&s;tered. The king did not in reality grant an act of indemnity; the prevailing power, then in a manner the nation, in effect granted an indemnity to <HI>him.</HI> The idea of a preceding rebellion was not at all admitted in that convention and that parliament. The regicides were a common enemy, and as &s;uch given up.</P>
<P>Among the ornaments of their place which emi|nently di&s;tingui&s;h them, few people are better ac|quainted with the hi&s;tory of their own country than the illu&s;trious Princes now in exile: but I caution them not to be led into error by that which has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be the guide of life. I would give the &s;ame caution to all princes. Not that I derogate from the u&s;e of hi&s;tory. It is a great improver of the under&s;tanding, by &s;hewing both men and affairs in a great variety of views. From this &s;ource much political wi&s;dom may be learned; that is, may be learned as habit, not as precept; and as an exerci&s;e to &s;trengthen the mind, as furni&s;hing materials to enlarge and enrich it, not as a repertory of ca&s;es and precedents for a lawyer; if it were, a thou&s;and times
<PB N="348" REF="174">
better would it be that a State&s;man had never learned to read&mdash;<HI>vellem ne&s;cirent literas.</HI> This method turns their under&s;tanding from the object before them, and from the pre&s;ent exigencies of the world, to compari&s;ons with former times, of which after all, we can know very little and very imperfectly; and our guides, the hi&s;torians, who are to give us their true interpretation, are often prejudiced, often ignorant, often fonder of &s;y&s;tem than of truth. Whereas, if a man with rea&s;onable good parts and natural &s;agacity, and not in the leading-&s;trings of any ma&s;ter, will look &s;teadily on the bu&s;ine&s;s before him, without being diverted by retro&s;pect and compari&s;on, he may be capable of forming a rea&s;onable good judgement of what is to be done. There are &s;ome fundamental points in which nature never changes&mdash;but they are few and obvious, and belong rather to morals than to politics. But &s;o far as regards political matter, the human mind and human affairs are &s;u&s;ceptible of infinite modifications, and of combinations wholly new and unlooked for. Very few, for in&s;tance, could have imagined that property, which has been taken for natural dominion, &s;hould, through the whole of a va&s;t kingdom, lo&s;e all its importance and even its influence. This is what hi&s;tory or books of &s;peculation could hardly have taught us. How many could have thought, that the mo&s;t complete and for|midable revolution in a great empire &s;hould be made by men of letters, not as &s;ubordinate in&s;truments and trumpeters of &s;edition, but as the chief contrivers and managers, and in a &s;hort time as the open admi|ni&s;trators and &s;overeign rulers? Who could have imagined that athei&s;m could produce one of the mo&s;t violently operative principles of fanatici&s;m? Who could have imagined, that in a commonwealth in a manner cradled in war, and in an exten&s;ive and dreadful war, military commanders &s;hould be of little or no account? That the convention &s;hould not contain one military man of name? That admi|ni&s;trative

bodies in a &s;tate of the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, and of but a momentary duration, and compo&s;ed of men with not one impo&s;ing part of character, &s;hould be able to govern the country and its armies, with an authority which the mo&s;t &s;ettled &s;enates, and the mo&s;t re&s;pected monarchs &s;carcely ever had in the &s;ame degree? This, for one, I confe&s;s I did not fore&s;ee, though all the re&s;t was pre&s;ent to me very early, and not out of my apprehen&s;ion even for &s;everal years.</P>
<P>I believe very few were able to enter into the effects of mere <HI>terror,</HI> as a principle not only for the &s;upport of power in given hands or forms, but in tho&s;e things in which the &s;ounde&s;t political &s;peculators were of opinion, that the lea&s;t appearance of force would be totally de&s;tructive, &s;uch is the market, whether of money, provi&s;ion, or commodities of any kind. Yet for four years we have &s;een loans made, trea&s;uries &s;upplied, and armies levied and maintained, more numerous than France ever &s;hewed in the field, by the <HI>effects of fear alone.</HI></P>
<P>Here is a &s;tate of things, of which, in its totality, if hi&s;tory furni&s;hes any examples at all, they are very remote and feeble. I therefore am not &s;o ready as &s;ome are, to tax with folly or cowardice, tho&s;e who were not prepared to meet an evil of this nature. Even now, after the events, all the cau&s;es may be &s;omewhat difficult to a&s;certain. Very many are however traceable. But the&s;e things hi&s;tory and books of &s;peculation (as I have already &s;aid) did not teach men to fore&s;ee, and of cour&s;e to re&s;i&s;t.

It appears indeed to be gene|rally acknowledged, that with regard to truth and fal&s;ehood there is &s;omething fixed.

<P>ONE would think, that after an hone&s;t and nece&s;|&s;ary revolution, (if they had a mind that theirs &s;hould pa&s;s for &s;uch) your ma&s;ters would have imitated the virtuous policy of tho&s;e who have been at the head of revolutions of that glorious character. Burnet tells us, that nothing tended to reconcile the Engli&s;h na|tion to the government of King William &s;o much as the care he took to fill the vacant bi&s;hoprics with men who had attracted the public e&s;teem by their learning, eloquence, and piety, and above all, by their known moderation in the &s;tate. With you, in your purify|ing revolution, whom have you cho&s;en to regulate the church? Mr. Mirabeau is a fine &s;peaker&mdash;and a fine writer&mdash;and a fine&mdash;a very fine man; but really nothing gave more &s;urprize to every body here, than to find him the &s;upreme head of your eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. The re&s;t is of cour&s;e. Your a&s;&s;embly ad|dre&s;&s;es a manife&s;to to France, in which they tell the people, with an in&s;ulting irony, that they have brought the church to its primitive condition. In one re&s;pect their declaration is undoubtedly true; for they have brought it to a &s;tate of poverty and per&s;ecution.&mdash;What can be hoped for after this? Have not men (if they de&s;erve the name) under this new hope and head of the church, been made bi&s;hops, for no other merit than having acted as in&s;truments of athei&s;ts; for no other merit than having thrown the children's bread to dogs; and in order to gorge the whole gang of u&s;urers, pedlars, and itinerant Jew di&s;counters at the corners of &s;treets, &s;tarved the poor of their Chri&s;|tian flocks, and their own brother pa&s;tors?

<P>I am told, that the very &s;ons of &s;uch Jew-jobbers have been made bi&s;hops; per&s;ons not to be &s;u&s;pected of any &s;ort of Chri&s;tian &s;uper&s;tition, fit colleagues to the holy prelate of Autun; and bred at the feet of that Gamaliel. We know who it was that drove the money changers out of the temple. We &s;ee too who it is that brings them in again. We have in London very re&s;pectable per&s;ons of the Jewi&s;h nation, whom we will keep; but we have of the &s;ame tribe others of a very different de&s;cription,&mdash;hou&s;e-breakers, and receivers of &s;tolen goods, and forgers of paper cur|rency, more than we can conveniently hang.

<P>In matters &s;o ridiculous, it is hard to be grave. On a view of their con&s;equences it is almo&s;t inhuman to treat them lightly.

<HEAD>REVENUE (FRENCH.)</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now &s;ay &s;omething of the ability &s;hewed by your legi&s;lators with regard to the revenue.</P>
<P>In their proceedings relative to this object, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till fewer traces appear of political judg|ment or financial re&s;ource. When the &s;tates met, it &s;eemed to be the great object to improve the &s;y&s;tem of revenue, to enlarge its connexion, to clean&s;e it of oppre&s;&s;ion and vexation, and to e&s;tabli&s;h it on the mo&s;t &s;olid footing. Great were the expectations en|tertained on that head throughout Europe. It was by this grand arrangement that France was to &s;tand or fall; and this became, in my opinion, very pro|perly, the te&s;t by which the &s;kill and patrioti&s;m of tho&s;e who ruled in that a&s;&s;embly would be tried. The revenue of the &s;tate is the &s;tate. In effect all depends upon it, whether for &s;upport or for refor|mation. The dignity of every occupation wholly depends upon the quantity and the kind of virtue that may be exerted in it. As all great qualities of the mind which operate in public, and are not merely &s;uffering and pa&s;&s;ive, require force for their di&s;play, I had almo&s;t &s;aid for their unequivocal exi&s;tence, the revenue, which is the &s;pring of all power, becomes in its admini&s;tration the &s;phere of every active vir|tue. Public virtue, being of a nature magnificent and &s;plendid, in&s;tituted for great things, and conver|&s;ant about great concerns, requires abundant &s;cope and room, and cannot &s;pread and grow under con|finement, and in circum&s;tances &s;traitened, narrow,
<PB N="358" REF="184">
and &s;ordid. Through the revenue alone, the body politic can act in its true genius and character, and therefore it will di&s;play ju&s;t as much of its col|lective virtue, and as much of that virtue which may characteri&s;e tho&s;e who move it, and are, as it were, its life and guiding principle, as it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a ju&s;t revenue. For from hence not only magnani|mity, and liberality, and beneficence, and fortitude, and providence, and the tutelary protection of all good arts, derive their food, and the growth of their organs, but continence, and &s;elf-denial, and labour, and vigilance, and frugality, and whatever el&s;e there is in which the mind &s;hews it&s;elf above the appetite, are no where more in their proper element than in the provi&s;ion and di&s;tribution of the public wealth. It is therefore not without rea&s;on that the &s;cience of &s;peculative and practical finance, which mu&s;t take to its aid &s;o many auxiliary branches of knowledge, &s;tands high in the e&s;timation not only of the ordinary &s;ort, but of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men; and as this &s;cience has grown with the progre&s;s of its object, the pro&s;perity and improvement of nations has generally encrea&s;ed with the encrea&s;e of their revenues; and they will both continue to grow and flouri&s;h, as long as the balance between what is left to &s;trengthen the efforts of individuals, and what is collected for the common efforts of the &s;tate, bear to each other a due reciprocal proportion, and are kept in a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence and communication. And perhaps it may be owing to the greatne&s;s of revenues, and to the urgency of &s;tate nece&s;&s;ities, that old abu&s;es in the con&s;titution of finances are di&s;covered, and their true nature and rational theory comes to be more perfectly under&s;tood; in&s;omuch, that a &s;maller reve|nue might have been more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing in one period than a far greater is found to be in another; the pro|portionate wealth even remaining the &s;ame.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Reflec|tions on the Revolution in France.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>RUSSEL (HOUSE OF.) Mr. Burke contra&s;ts his own Merit with that of the Founder of the Hou&s;e of Ru&s;&s;el.</HEAD>
<P>THE merit of the origin of his Grace's (Bedford) fortune was in being a favourite and chief advi&s;er to a prince, who left no liberty to their native country. My endeavour was to obtain liberty for the municipal country in which I was born, and for all de&s;criptions and denominations in it.&mdash;Mine was to &s;upport with unrelaxing vigilance every right, every privilege, every franchi&s;e, in this my adopted, my dearer and more comprehen&s;ive country; and not only to pre|&s;erve tho&s;e rights in this chief feat of empire, but in every nation, in every land, in every climate, lan|guage and religion, in the va&s;t domain that &s;till is under the protection, and the larger that was once under the protection, of the Briti&s;h crown.</P>
<P>His founder's merits were, by arts in which he &s;erved his ma&s;ter and made his fortune, to bring po|verty,
<PB N="360" REF="186">
wretchedne&s;s and depopulation on his country. Mine were under a benevolent prince, in promoting the commerce, manufactures and agriculture of his kingdom; in which his maje&s;ty &s;hews an eminent example, who even in his amu&s;ements is a patriot, and in hours of lei&s;ure an improver of his native &s;oil.</P>
<P>His founder's merit, was the merit of a gentleman rai&s;ed by the arts of a court, and the protection of a Wol&s;ey, to the eminence of a great and potent lord. His merit in that eminence was by in&s;tigating a tyrant to inju&s;tice, to provoke a people to rebellion.&mdash;My merit was, to awaken the &s;ober part of the country, that they might put them&s;elves on their guard again&s;t any one potent lord, or any greater number of potent lords, or any combination of great leading men of any &s;ort, if ever they &s;hould attempt to proceed in the &s;ame cour&s;es, but in the rever&s;e order, that is, by in&s;tigating a corrupt populace to rebellion, and, through that rebellion, &s;hould intro|duce a tyranny yet wor&s;e than the tyranny which his Grace's ance&s;tor &s;upported, and of which he profited in the manner we behold in the de&s;poti&s;m of Henry the Eighth.</P>
<P>The political merit of the fir&s;t pen&s;ioner of his Grace's hou&s;e, was that of being concerned as a coun&s;ellor of &s;tate in advi&s;ing, and in his per&s;on exe|cuting the conditions of a di&s;honourable peace with France; the &s;urrendering the fortre&s;s of Boulogne, then our out guard on the continent. By that &s;ur|render, Calais, the key of France, and the bridle in the mouth of that power, was, not many years after|wards, finally lo&s;t. My merit has been in re&s;i&s;ting the power and pride of France, under any form of it's rule; but in oppo&s;ing it with the greate&s;t zeal and earne&s;tne&s;s, when that rule appeared in the wor&s;t form it could a&s;&s;ume; the wor&s;t indeed which the prime cau&s;e and principle of all evil could po&s;&s;ibly give it. It was my endeavour by every means to ex|cite a &s;pirit in the hou&s;e, where I had the honour of
<PB N="361" REF="187">
a &s;eat, for carrying on with early vigour and deci&s;ion, the mo&s;t clearly ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary war, that this or any nation ever carried on; in order to &s;ave my country from the iron yoke of it's power, and from the more dreadful contagion of its principles; to pre|&s;erve, while they can be pre&s;erved pure and un|tainted, the ancient, inbred integrity, piety, good nature, and good humour of the people of England, from the dreadful pe&s;tilence which beginning in France, threatens to lay wa&s;te the whole moral, and in a great degree the whole phy&s;ical world, having done both in the focus of it's mo&s;t inten&s;e malignity.</P>
<P>The labours of his Grace's founder merited the cur&s;es, not loud but deep, of the Commons of Eng|land, on whom <HI>he</HI> and his ma&s;ter had effected a <HI>complete parliamentary reform,</HI> in making them in their &s;lavery and humiliation, the true and adequate repre&s;entatives of a deba&s;ed, degraded, and undone people. My merits were, in having had an active, though not always an o&s;tentatious &s;hare, in every one act, without exception, of undi&s;puted con&s;titutional utility in my time, and in having &s;upported on all occa&s;ions, the authority, the efficiency, and the pri|vileges of the Commons of Great Britain. I ended my &s;ervices by a recorded and fully rea&s;oned a&s;&s;er|tion on their own journals of their con&s;titutional rights, and a vindication of their con&s;titutional con|duct. I laboured in all things to merit their inward approbation, and (along with the a&s;&s;i&s;tants of the large&s;t, the greate&s;t, and be&s;t of my endeavours) I received their free, unbia&s;&s;ed, public, and &s;olemn thanks.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tands the account of the comparative merits of the crown grants which compo&s;e the duke of Bed|ford's fortune as balanced again&s;t mine. In the name of common &s;en&s;e, why &s;hould the duke of Bedford think, that none but of the hou&s;e of Ru&s;&s;el are en|titled to the favour of the crown? Why &s;hould he imagine that no king of England has been capable of judging of merit but king Henry the Eighth? Indeed,
<PB N="362" REF="188">
he will pardon me; he is a little mi&s;taken; all virtue did not end in the fir&s;t earl of Bedford. All di&s;cern|ment did not lo&s;e its vi&s;ion when his creator clo&s;ed his eyes. Let him remit his rigour on the di&s;pro|portion between merit and reward in others, and they will make no enquiry into the origin of his fortune. They will regard with much more &s;atis|faction, as he will contemplate with infinitely more advantage, whatever in his pedigree has been dulci|fied by an expo&s;ure to the influence of heaven in a long flow of generations, from the hard, acidulous, metallic tincture of the &s;pring. It is little to be doubted, that &s;everal of his forefathers in that long &s;eries, have degenerated into honour and virtue. Let the duke of Bedford (I am &s;ure he will) reject with &s;corn and horror, the coun&s;els of the lecturers, tho&s;e wicked panders to avarice and ambition, who would tempt him in the troubles of his country, to &s;eek another enormous fortune from the forfeitures of another nobility, and the plunder of another church. Let him (and I tru&s;t that yet he will) em|ploy all the energy of his youth, and all the re&s;ources of his wealth, to cru&s;h rebellious principles which have no foundation in morals, and rebellious move|ments, that have no provocation in tyranny.</P>
<P>Then will be forgot the rebellions, which, by a doubtful priority in crime, his ance&s;tor had pro|voked and extingui&s;hed. On &s;uch a conduct in the noble duke, many of his countrymen might, and with &s;ome excu&s;e might, give way to the enthu&s;ia&s;m of their gratitude, and in the da&s;hing &s;tyle of &s;ome of the old declaimers, cry out, that if the fates had found no other way in which they could give a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At &s;i non aliam venturo fata Neroni, &amp;c.</NOTE> duke of Bedford and his opulence as props to a tottering world, then the butchery of the duke of Buckingham might be tolerated; it might be regarded even with complacency, whil&s;t in the heir of confi&s;cation they

Then his Grace's merit would be pure and new, and &s;harp as fre&s;h from the mint of honour. As he plea&s;ed he might reflect honour on his predece&s;&s;ors, or throw it forward on tho&s;e who were to &s;ucceed him.

<HEAD>REFORMAMION. Short View of the Reformation.</HEAD>
<P>GENTLEMEN, the condition of our nature is &s;uch, that we buy our ble&s;&s;ings at a price. The Reforma|tion, one of the greate&s;t periods of human improve|ment, was a time of trouble and confu&s;ion. The va&s;t &s;tructure of &s;uper&s;tition and tyranny, which had been for ages in rearing, and which was combined with the intere&s;t of the great and of the many; which was moulded into the laws, the manners, and civil in&s;titu|tions of nations, and blended with the frame and po|licy of &s;tates; could not be brought to the ground without a fearful &s;truggle; nor could it fall without a violent concu&s;&s;ion of it&s;elf and all about it. When this great revolution was attempted in a more regular mode by government, it was oppo&s;ed by plots and &s;editions of the people; when by popular efforts, it was repre&s;&s;ed as rebellion by the hand of power; and bloody executions (often bloodily returned) mark|ed the whole of its progre&s;s through all its &s;tages. The affairs of religion, which are no longer heard of in the tumult of our pre&s;ent contentions, made a prin|cipal ingredient in the wars and politics of that time; the enthu&s;ia&s;m of religion threw a gloom over the politics; and political intere&s;ts poi&s;oned and perverted
<PB N="364" REF="190">
the &s;pirit of religion upon all &s;ides. The Prote&s;tant religion in that violent &s;truggle, infected, as the Popi&s;h had been before, by worldly intere&s;ts and worldly pa&s;|&s;ions, became a per&s;ecutor in its turn, &s;ometimes of the new &s;ects, which carried their own principles fur|ther than it was convenient to the original reformers; and always of the body from whom they parted; and this per&s;ecuting &s;pirit aro&s;e, not only, from the bitter|ne&s;s of retaliation, but from the mercile&s;s policy of fear.</P>
<P>It was long before the &s;pirit of true piety and true wi&s;dom, involved in the principles of the Reforma|tion, could be depurated from the dregs and feculence of the contention with which it was carried through. However, until this be done, the Reformation is not complete; and tho&s;e who think them&s;elves good Pro|te&s;tants, from their animo&s;ity to others, are, in that re&s;pect, no Prote&s;tants at all. It was at fir&s;t thought nece&s;&s;ary, perhaps, to oppo&s;e to Popery another Po|pery, to get the better of it. Whatever was the cau&s;e, laws were made in many countries, and in this king|dom in particular, again&s;t Papi&s;ts, which are as bloody as any of tho&s;e which had been enacted by the popi&s;h princes and &s;tates; and where tho&s;e laws were not bloody, in my opinion, they were wor&s;e; as they were &s;low, cruel outrages on our nature, and kept men alive only to in&s;ult in their per&s;ons, every one of the rights and feelings of humanity.

<P>POLAND, with the Elector of Saxony, will con|tribute mo&s;t to &s;trengthen the Royal authority of Po|land, or to &s;hake the Ducal in Saxony.

This law is not &s;ubject to the will of tho&s;e, who by an obligation above them, and infinitely &s;uperior, are bound to &s;ubmit their will to that law. The municipal corpo|rations of that univer&s;al kingdom are not morally at liberty at their plea&s;ure, and on their &s;peculations of a contingent improvement, wholly to &s;eparate and tear a&s;under the bands of their &s;ubordinate commu|nity, and to di&s;&s;olve it into an un&s;ocial, uncivil, un|connected chaos of elementary principles. It is the fir&s;t and &s;upreme nece&s;&s;ity only, a nece&s;&s;ity that is not cho&s;en but choo&s;es, a nece&s;&s;ity paramount to deliberation, that admits no di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and demands no evidence, which alone can ju&s;tify a re&s;ort to anar|chy. This nece&s;&s;ity is no exception to the rule; becau&s;e this nece&s;&s;ity it&s;elf is a part too of that moral and phy&s;ical di&s;po&s;ition of things to which man mu&s;t be obedient by con&s;ent or force; but if that which is only &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould be made the object of choice, the law is broken, nature is di&s;|obeyed, and the rebellious are outlawed, ca&s;t forth,

In a &s;tate of nature, it had been impo&s;&s;ible to find a number of men, &s;ufficient for &s;uch &s;laughters, agreed in the &s;ame bloody purpo&s;e; or allowing that they might have come to &s;uch an agreement, (an impo&s;|&s;ible &s;uppo&s;ition) yet the means that &s;imple nature has &s;upplied them with, are by no means adequate to &s;uch an end; many &s;cratches, many brui&s;es undoubt|edly would be received upon all hands; but only a few, a very few deaths.

<HEAD>SOCIETIES (POPULAR.) Remarks on the Con&s;titutional and Revolution Societies.</HEAD>
<P>I certainly have the honour to belong to more clubs than one, in which the con&s;titution of this kingdom, and the principles of the glorious revolu|tion are held in high reverence: and I reckon my&s;elf among the mo&s;t forward in my zeal for maintaining that con&s;titution and tho&s;e principles in the utmo&s;t purity and vigour. It is becau&s;e I do &s;o, that I think it nece&s;&s;ary for me, that there &s;hould be no mi&s;take. Tho&s;e who cultivate the memory of our revolution, and tho&s;e who are attached to the con&s;ti|tution of this kingdom, will take good care how they are involved with per&s;ons who, under the pretext of zeal towards the revolution and con&s;titution, too fre|quently wander from their true principles; and are ready, on every occa&s;ion, to depart from the firm, but cautious and deliberate &s;pirit which produced the one, and which pre&s;ides in the other. Before I pro|ceed to an&s;wer the more material particulars in your letter, I &s;hall beg leave to give you &s;uch information as I have been able to obtain of the two clubs which have thought proper, as bodies, to interfere in the concerns of France; fir&s;t a&s;&s;uring you, that I am not, and that I have never been, a member of either of tho&s;e &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, calling it&s;elf the Con&s;titutional Society, or Society for Con&s;titutional Information, or by &s;ome &s;uch title, is, I believe, of &s;even or eight years &s;tand|ing. The in&s;titution of this &s;ociety appears to be of a charitable, and &s;o far of a laudable, nature: it was intended for the circulation, at the expence of the
<PB N="375" REF="201">
members, of many books, which few others would be at the expence of buying; and which might lie on the hands of the book&s;ellers, to the great lo&s;s of an u&s;eful body of men. Whether the books &s;o charitably circulated, were ever as charitably read, is more than I know. Po&s;&s;ibly &s;everal of them have been exported to France; and, like goods not in reque&s;t here, may with you have found a market. I have heard much talk of the lights to be drawn from books that are &s;ent from hence. What im|provements they have had in their pa&s;&s;age (as it is &s;aid &s;ome liquors are meliorated by cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ea) I cannot tell: but I never heard a man of common judgment, or the lea&s;t degree of information, &s;peak a word in prai&s;e of the greater part of the publica|tions circulated by that &s;ociety; nor have their pro|ceedings been accounted, except by &s;ome of them|&s;elves, as of any &s;erious con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Your national a&s;&s;embly &s;eems to entertain much the &s;ame opinion that I do of this poor charitable club. As a nation, you re&s;erved the whole &s;tock of your eloquent acknowledgments for the Revolution Society; when their fellows in the Con&s;titutional were, in equity, entitled to &s;ome &s;hare. Since you have &s;elected the Revolution Society as the great object of your national thanks and prai&s;es, you will think me excu&s;eable in making its late conduct the &s;ubject of my ob&s;ervations. The national a&s;&s;embly of France has given importance to the&s;e gentlemen by adopting them; and they return the favour, by acting as a committee in England for extending the principles of the national a&s;&s;embly. Henceforward we mu&s;t con&s;ider them as a kind of privileged per|&s;ons; as no incon&s;iderable members in the diplomatic body. This is one among the revolutions which have given &s;plendor to ob&s;curity, and di&s;tinction to undi&s;cerned merit. Until very lately I do not re|collect to have heard of this club. I am quite &s;ure that it never occupied a moment of my thoughts;
<PB N="376" REF="202">
nor, I believe, tho&s;e of any per&s;on out of their own &s;et. I find, upon enquiry, that on the anniver&s;ary of the revolution in 1688, a club of di&s;&s;enters, but of what denomination I know not, have long had the cu&s;tom of hearing a &s;ermon in one of their churches; and that afterwards they &s;pent the day cheerfully, as other clubs do, at the tavern. But I never heard that any public mea&s;ure, or political &s;y&s;tem, much le&s;s that the merits of the con&s;titution of any foreign nation, had been the &s;ubject of a formal proceeding at their fe&s;tivals; until, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urprize, I found them in a &s;ort of pub|lic capacity, by a congratulatory addre&s;s, giving an authoritative &s;anction to the proceedings of the nati|onal a&s;&s;embly in France.</P>
<P>In the antient principles and conduct of the club, &s;o far at lea&s;t as they were declared, I &s;ee nothing to which I could take exception. I think it very probable, that for &s;ome purpo&s;e, new members may have entered among them; and that &s;ome truly chri&s;tian politicians, who love to di&s;pen&s;e benefits, but are careful to conceal the hand which di&s;tributes the dole, may have made them the in&s;truments of their pious de&s;igns. Whatever I may have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect concerning private management, I &s;hall &s;peak of nothing as of a certainty but what is public.</P>
<P>For one, I &s;hould be &s;orry to be thought, directly or indirectly, concerned in their proceedings. I certainly take my full &s;hare, along with the re&s;t of the world, in my individual and private capacity, in &s;peculating on what has been done, or is doing, on the public &s;tage; in any place antient or modern; in the republic of Rome, or the republic of Paris: but having no general apo&s;tolical mi&s;&s;ion, being a citizen of a particular &s;tate, and being bound up in a con&s;iderable degree, by its public will, I &s;hould think it at lea&s;t improper and irregular for me to open a formal public corre&s;pondence with the actual government of a foreign nation, without the expre&s;s authority of the government under which I live.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="203">I &s;hould be &s;till more unwilling to enter into that corre&s;pondence, under any thing like an equivocal de&s;cription, which to many, unacquainted with our u&s;ages, might make the addre&s;s, in which I joined, appear as the act of per&s;ons in &s;ome &s;ort of corporate capacity, acknowledged by the laws of this kingdom, and authorized to &s;peak the &s;en&s;e of &s;ome part of it. On account of the ambiguity and uncertainty of unauthorized general de&s;criptions, and of the deceit which may be practi&s;ed under them, and not from mere formality, the Hou&s;e of Commons would reject the mo&s;t &s;neaking petition for the mo&s;t trifling ob|ject, under that mode of &s;ignature to which you have thrown open the folding-doors of your pre&s;ence chamber, and have u&s;hered into your National A&s;&s;em|bly, with as much ceremony and parade, and with as great a bu&s;tle of applau&s;e, as if you had been vi&s;ited by the whole repre&s;entave maje&s;ty of the whole Eng|li&s;h nation. If what this &s;ociety has thought proper to &s;end forth had been a piece of argument, it would have &s;ignified little who&s;e argument it was. It would be neither the more nor the le&s;s convincing on ac|count of the party it came from. But this is only a vote and re&s;olution. It &s;tands &s;olely on authority; and in this ca&s;e it is the mere authority of indivi|duals, few of whom appear. Their &s;ignatures ought, in my opinion, to have been annexed to their in&s;tru|ment. The world would then have the means of knowing how many they are; who they are; and of what value their opinions may be, from their per|&s;onal abilities, from their knowledge, their experi|ence, or their lead and authority in this &s;tate. To me, who am but a plain man, the proceeding looks a little too refined, and too ingenious; it has too much the air of a political &s;tratagem, adopted for the &s;ake of giving, under an high &s;ounding name, an importance to the public declarations of this club, which, when the matter came to be clo&s;ely in&s;pected, they did not altogether &s;o well de&s;erve.

But as applied to the events which had hap|pened in France, where the ab&s;tract principle it cloathed with its circum&s;tances, I think that my friend (Mr. Fox) would agree with me, that what was done there furni&s;hed no matter of exultation, either in the act or the example. The&s;e &s;oldiers were not citizens; but ba&s;e hireling mutineers, and mer|cenary &s;ordid de&s;erters, wholly de&s;titute of any ho|nourable principles.

<HEAD>STATES (ECCLESIASTICAL.) Seeds of Revolution not wanting in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical States.</HEAD>
<P>IN the e&s;tates of the church, notwith&s;tanding their &s;trictne&s;s in bani&s;hing the French out of that country, there are not wanting the &s;eeds of a revolution. The &s;pirit of Nepoti&s;m prevails there nearly as &s;trong as ever. Every pope of cour&s;e is to give origin or re&s;toration to a great family, by the means of large donations. The foreign revenues have long been gradually on the decline, and &s;eem now in a manner dried up. To &s;upply this defect the re&s;ource of vexatious and impolitic jobbing at home, if any thing, is rather encrea&s;ed than le&s;&s;ened. Various, well intended but ill under&s;tood practices, &s;ome of them exi&s;ting, in their &s;pirit at lea&s;t, from the time of the old Roman empire, &s;till prevail; and that go|vernment is as blindly attached to old abu&s;ive cu&s;|toms, as others are wildly di&s;po&s;ed to all &s;orts of in|novations and experiments. The&s;e abu&s;es were le&s;s felt whil&s;t the pontificate drew riches from abroad, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure counterbalanced the evils of their remi&s;s and jobbi&s;h government at home. But now it can &s;ub&s;i&s;t only on the re&s;ources of dome&s;tic management; and abu&s;es in that management of cour&s;e will be more intimately and more &s;everely felt.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the apparently torpid languor of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, tho&s;e who have had oppor|tunity of a near ob&s;ervation, have &s;een a little rip|pling in that &s;mooth water, which indicates &s;ome|thing alive under it.

He is not at all made for a Roman of the pre&s;ent day. I think he lately held the fir&s;t office of their &s;tate, that of Great Chamberlain, which is equiva|lent to High Trea&s;urer.

<HEAD>SUBLIME. The Sublime and Beautiful compared.</HEAD>
<P>ON clo&s;ing this general view of beauty, it natu|rally occurs, that we &s;hould compare it with the &s;ub|lime; and in this compari&s;on there appears a remark|able contra&s;t. For &s;ublime objects are va&s;t in their dimen&s;ions, beautiful ones comparatively &s;mall: beauty &s;hould be &s;mooth and poli&s;hed; the great, rugged and negligent; beauty &s;hould &s;hun the right line, yet deviate from it in&s;en&s;ibly; the great, in many ca&s;es, loves the right line; and when it devi|ates, it often makes a &s;trong deviation: beauty &s;hould not be ob&s;cure; the great ought to be dark and
<PB N="393" REF="219">
gloomy: beauty &s;hould be light and delicate; the great ought to be &s;olid, and even ma&s;&s;ive. They are, indeed, ideas of a very different nature, one being founded on pain, the other on plea&s;ure; and however they may vary afterwards from the direct nature of their cau&s;es, yet the&s;e cau&s;es keep up an eternal di&s;tinction between them, a di&s;tinction never to be forgotten by any who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to affect the pa&s;&s;ions. In the infinite variety of natural com|binations, we mu&s;t expect to find the qualities of things the mo&s;t remote imaginable from each other united in the &s;ame object. We mu&s;t expect al&s;o to find combinations of the &s;ame kind in the works of art. But when we con&s;ider the power of an object upon our pa&s;&s;ions, we mu&s;t know that when any thing is intended to affect the mind by the force of &s;ome predominant property, the affection produced is like to be the more uniform and perfect, if all the other properties or qualities of the object be of the &s;ame nature, and tending to the &s;ame de&s;ign as the principal;

Here is a very noble picture; and in what does this poetical picture con&s;i&s;t? in images of a tower, an archangel, the &s;un ri&s;ing through mi&s;ts, or in an eclip&s;e, the ruin of monarchs, and the revolutions of kingdoms. The mind is hurried out of it&s;elf, by a crowd of great and confu&s;ed images; which affect becau&s;e they are crowded and confu&s;ed. For &s;epa|rate them, and you lo&s;e much of the greatne&s;s; and join them, and you infallibly lo&s;e the clearne&s;s. The images rai&s;ed by poetry are always of this ob&s;cure kind; though in general the effects of poetry are by no means to be attributed to the images it rai&s;es. But painting, when we have allowed for the plea&s;ure of imitation, can only affect &s;imply by the images it pre&s;ents; and even in painting, a judicious ob&s;curity in &s;ome things contributes to the effect of the picture; becau&s;e the images in painting are exactly &s;imilar to tho&s;e in nature; and in nature dark, confu&s;ed, un|certain images have a greater power on the fancy to form the grander pa&s;&s;ions, than tho&s;e have which are more clear and determinate. But where and when this ob&s;ervation may be applied to practice, and how far it &s;hall be extended, will be better de|duced from the nature of the &s;ubject, and from the occa&s;ion, than from any rules that can be given.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that this idea has met with oppo&s;ition, and is likely &s;till to be rejected by &s;everal. But let it be con&s;idered, that hardly any thing can &s;trike the mind with its greatne&s;s, which does not make &s;ome &s;ort of approach towards infinity; which nothing can do whil&s;t we are able to perceive its bounds; but to fee an object di&s;tinctly, and to perceive its bounds, is one and the &s;ame thing. A clear idea is therefore another name for a-little idea. There is a pa&s;&s;age in the book of Job amazingly &s;ublime, and this &s;ub|limity is principally due to the terrible uncertainty of the thing de&s;cribed: <HI>In thoughts from the vi&s;ions of the night, when deep &s;leep &s;alleth upon men, fear came upon me and trembling, which made all my bones to</HI>

When painters have attempted to give us clear repre&s;entations of the&s;e very fanciful and terrible ideas, they have, I think, almo&s;t always failed; in&s;omuch that I have been at a lo&s;s, in all the pictures I have &s;een of hell, whether the painter did not intend &s;omething ludicrous. Several painters have handled a &s;ubject of this kind with a view of a&s;&s;embling as many horrid phantoms as their imaginations could &s;ugge&s;t; but all the de&s;igns I have chanced to meet of the temptations of St. Anthony, were rather a &s;ort of odd wild grote&s;ques, than any thing capable of producing a &s;erious pa&s;&s;ion. In all the&s;e &s;ubjects poetry is very happy. Its appa|ritions, its chimeras, its harpies, its allegorical figures, are grand and affecting; and though Virgil's Fame, and Homer's Di&s;cord, are ob&s;cure, they are magni|ficent figures.

<P>As to Switzerland, it is a country who&s;e long union, rather than its po&s;&s;ible divi&s;ion, is the matter of wonder. Here I know they entertain very &s;an|guine hopes. The aggregation to France of the de|mocratic Swi&s;s republics appears to them to be a work half done by their very form; and it might &s;eem to them rather an encrea&s;e of importance to the&s;e little commonwealths, than a derogation from their independency, or a change in the manner of their government. Upon any quarrel among&s;t the cantons nothing is more likely than &s;uch an event. As to the ari&s;tocratic republics, the general clamour and hatred which the French excite again&s;t the very name, (and with more facility and &s;ucce&s;s than again&s;t monarchs) and the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of their govern|ment making any &s;ort of re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t an in&s;ur|rection, where they have no troops, and the people are all armed and trained, render their hopes in that quarter, far indeed from unfounded. It is certain that the republic of Berne thinks it&s;elf obliged to a vigilance next to ho&s;tile, and to impri&s;on or expel all the French whom they find in their territories. But indeed tho&s;e ari&s;tocracies which comprehend whatever is con&s;iderable, wealthy, and valuable in Switzerland, do now &s;o wholly depend upon opinion, and the humour of their multitude, that the lighte&s;t puff of wind is &s;ufficient to blow them down. If France, under its ancient regimen, and upon the ancient principles of policy, was the &s;upport of the Germanic con&s;titution, it was much more &s;o of that of Switzerland, which almo&s;t from the very origin of that confederacy re&s;ted upon the clo&s;ene&s;s of its connection with France, on which the Swi&s;s cantons wholly repo&s;ed them&s;elves for the pre&s;ervation of the parts of their body in their re&s;pective rights and permanent forms, as well as for the maintenance of all in their general independency.</P>

<HEAD>TASTE. General Idea of Ta&s;te.</HEAD>
<P>But to cut off all pretence for cavilling, I mean by the word Ta&s;te, no more than that faculty or tho&s;e faculties of the mind, which are affected with, or which form a judgment of, the works of imagination and the elegant arts. This is, I think, the mo&s;t general idea of that word, and what is the lea&s;t connected with any particular theory. And my point in this inquiry is, to find whether there are any principles, on which the imagination is affected, &s;o common to all, &s;o grounded and certain, as to &s;upply the means of rea|&s;oning &s;atisfactorily about them. And &s;uch principles of ta&s;te I fancy there are; however paradoxical it may &s;eem to tho&s;e who, on a &s;uperficial view, ima|gine that there is &s;o great a diver&s;ity of ta&s;tes, both in kind and degree, that nothing can be more deter|minate.</P>
<P>All the natural powers in man, which I know, that are conver&s;ant about external objects, are the &s;en&s;es; the imagination; and the judgment. And fir&s;t with
<PB N="400" REF="226">
regard to the &s;en&s;es. We do and we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that as the conformation of their organs are nearly or altogether the &s;ame in all men, &s;o the manner of per|ceiving external objects is in all men the &s;ame, or with little difference. We are &s;atisfied that what ap|pears to be light to one eye, appears light to another; that what &s;eems &s;weet to one palate, is &s;weet to an|other; that what is dark and bitter to this man, is likewi&s;e dark and bitter to that; and we conclude in the &s;ame manner of great and little, hard and &s;oft, hot and cold, rough and &s;mooth; and indeed of all the natural qualities and affections of bodies. If we &s;uffer our&s;elves to imagine, that their &s;en&s;es pre&s;ent to different men different images of things, this &s;cep|tical proceeding will make every &s;ort of rea&s;oning on every &s;ubject vain and frivolous, even that &s;ceptical rea&s;oning it&s;elf which had per&s;uaded us to entertain a doubt concerning the agreement of our perceptions. But as there will be little doubt that bodies pre&s;ent &s;imilar images to the whole &s;pecies, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be allowed, that the plea&s;ures and the pains which every object excites in one man, it mu&s;t rai&s;e in all mankind, whil&s;t it operates naturally, &s;imply, and by its proper powers only; for if we deny this, we mu&s;t imagine that the &s;ame cau&s;e operating in the &s;ame man|ner, and on &s;ubjects of the &s;ame kind, will produce different effects, which would be highly ab&s;urd. Let us fir&s;t con&s;ider this point in the &s;en&s;e of ta&s;te, and the rather as the faculty in que&s;tion has taken its name from that &s;en&s;e. All men are agreed to call vinegar &s;our, honey &s;weet, and aloes bitter; and as they are all agreed in finding the&s;e qualities in tho&s;e objects, they do not in the lea&s;t differ concerning their effects with regard to plea&s;ure and pain. They all concur in call|ing &s;weetne&s;s plea&s;ant, and &s;ourne&s;s and bitterne&s;s un|plea&s;ant. Here there is no diver&s;ity in their &s;enti|ments; and that there is not, appears fully from the con&s;ent of all men in the metaphors which are taken from the &s;en&s;e of ta&s;te. A &s;our temper, bitter expre&s;|&s;ions,
<PB N="401" REF="227">
bitter cur&s;es, a bitter fate, are terms well and &s;trongly under&s;tood by all. And we are altogether as well under&s;tood when we &s;ay a &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition, a &s;weet per&s;on, a &s;weet condition, and the like. It is con|fe&s;&s;ed, that cu&s;tom, and &s;ome other cau&s;es, have made many deviations from the natural plea&s;ures or pains which belong to the&s;e &s;everal ta&s;tes; but then the power of di&s;tingui&s;hing between the natural and the acquired reli&s;h remains to the very la&s;t. A man fre|quently comes to prefer the ta&s;te of tobacco to that of &s;ugar, and the flavour of vinegar to that of milk; but this makes no confu&s;ion in ta&s;tes, whil&s;t he is &s;en&s;ible that the tobacco and vinegar are not &s;weet, and whil&s;t he knows that habit alone has reconciled his palate to the&s;e alien plea&s;ures. Even with &s;uch a per&s;on we may &s;peak, and with &s;ufficient preci&s;ion, concerning ta&s;tes. But &s;hould any man be found who declares, that to him tobacco has a ta&s;te like &s;ugar, and that he cannot di&s;tingui&s;h between milk and vinegar; or that tobacco and vinegar are &s;weet, milk bitter, and &s;ugar &s;our; we immediately conclude that the organs of this man are out of order, and that his palate is utterly vitiated. We are as far from conferring with &s;uch a per&s;on upon ta&s;tes, as from rea&s;oning concerning the relations of quantity, with one who &s;hould deny that all the parts together were equal to the whole. We do not call a man of this kind wrong in his notions, but ab&s;olutely mad. Exceptions of this &s;ort, in either way, do not at all impeach our general rule, nor make us conclude that men have various principles concerning the rela|tions of quantity, or the ta&s;te of things. So that when it is &s;aid, ta&s;te cannot be di&s;puted, it can only mean, that no one can &s;trictly an&s;wer what plea&s;ure or pain &s;ome particular man may find from the ta&s;te of &s;ome parti|cular th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ng. This indeed cannot be di&s;puted; but we may di&s;pute, and with &s;ufficient clearne&s;s too, concern|ing the things which are naturally plea&s;ing or di&s;agree able to the &s;en&s;e. But when we talk of any peculiar or acquired reli&s;h, then we mu&s;t know the habits, the

prejudices, or the di&s;tempers of this particular man, and we mu&s;t draw our conclu&s;ion from tho&s;e.</P>
<P>This agreement of mankind is not confined to the ta&s;te &s;olely. The principle of plea&s;ure derived from &s;ight is the &s;ame in all. Light is more plea&s;ing than darkne&s;s.

it is po&s;&s;ible that the man in que&s;tion may &s;top here, and that the ma&s;ter-piece of a great hand may plea&s;e him no more than the middling performance of a vulgar arti&s;t; and this not for want of better or higher reli&s;h, but becau&s;e all men do not ob&s;erve with &s;uf|ficient accuracy on the human figure to enable them to judge properly of an imitation of it. And that the critical ta&s;te does not depend upon a &s;uperior principle in men, but upon &s;uperior knowledge, may appear from &s;everal in&s;tances. The &s;tory of the an|tient painter and the &s;hoemaker is very well known. The &s;hoemaker &s;et the painter right with regard to &s;ome mi&s;takes he had made in the &s;hoe of one of his figures, and which the painter, who had not made &s;uch accurate ob&s;ervations on &s;hoes, and was content with a general re&s;emblance, had never ob&s;erved. But this was no impeachment to the ta&s;te of the painter; it only &s;hewed &s;ome want of knowledge in the art of making &s;hoes. Let us imagine, that an anatomi&s;t had come into the painter's working room. His piece is in general well done, the figure in que&s;|tion in a good attitude, and the parts well adju&s;ted to their various movements; yet the anatomi&s;t, criti|cal in his art, may ob&s;erve the &s;well of &s;ome mu&s;cle not quite ju&s;t in the peculiar action of the figure. Here the anatomi&s;t ob&s;erves what the painter had not ob&s;erved; and he pa&s;&s;es by what the &s;hoemaker had remarked. But a want of the la&s;t critical knowledge in anatomy no more reflected on the natural good ta&s;te of the painter, or of any common ob&s;erver of his piece, than the want of an exact knowledge in the formation of a &s;hoe. A fine piece of a decol|lated head of St. John the Bapti&s;t was &s;hewn to a Turki&s;h emperor; he prai&s;ed many things, but he ob&s;erved one defect; he ob&s;erved that the &s;kin did not &s;hrink from the wounded part of the neck. The &s;ultan on this occa&s;ion, though his ob&s;ervation was very ju&s;t, di&s;covered no more natural ta&s;te than the painter who executed this piece, or than a thou&s;and

His Turki&s;h ma|je&s;ty had indeed been well acquainted with that ter|rible &s;pectacle, which the others could only have re|pre&s;ented in their imagination. On the &s;ubject of their di&s;like there is a difference between all the&s;e people, ari&s;ing from the different kinds and degrees of their knowledge; but there is &s;omething in com|mon to the painter, the &s;hoemaker, the anatomi&s;t, and the Turki&s;h emperor, the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from a natural object, &s;o far as each perceives it ju&s;tly imitated; the &s;atisfaction in &s;eeing an agreeable figure; the &s;ympathy proceeding from a &s;triking and affecting incident.

<HEAD>TRAGEDY. The Effects of Tragedy.</HEAD>
<P>IT is thus in real calamities. In imitated di&s;tre&s;&s;es the only difference is the plea&s;ure re&s;ulting from the effects of imitation; for it is never &s;o perfect, but we can perceive it is imitation, and on that principle are &s;omewhat plea&s;ed with it. And indeed in &s;ome ca&s;es we derive as much or more plea&s;ure from that &s;ource than from the thing it&s;elf. But then I imagine we &s;hall be much mi&s;taken if we attribute any con&s;i|derable part of our &s;atisfaction in tragedy to the con|&s;ideration that tragedy is a deceit, and its repre&s;enta|tion, no realities. The nearer it approaches the reality, and the further it removes us from all idea of fiction, the more perfect is its power. But be its
<PB N="409" REF="235">
power of what kind it will, it never approaches to what it repre&s;ents. Choo&s;e a day on which to repre|&s;ent the mo&s;t &s;ublime and affecting tragedy we have; appoint the mo&s;t favourite actors; &s;pare no co&s;t upon the &s;cenes and decorations; unite the greate&s;t efforts of poetry, painting, and mu&s;ic; and when you have collected your audience, ju&s;t at the moment when their minds are erect with expectation, let it be re|ported that a &s;tate criminal of high rank is on the point of being executed in the adjoining &s;quare; in a moment the emptine&s;s of the theatre would demon|&s;trate the comparative weakne&s;s of the imitative arts, and proclaim the triumph of the real &s;ympathy. I believe that this notion of our having a &s;imple pain in the reality, yet a delight in the repre&s;entation, ari&s;es from hence, that we do not &s;ufficiently di&s;tin|gui&s;h what we would by no means choo&s;e to do, from what we &s;hould be eager enough to &s;ee if it was once done. We delight in &s;eeing things, which &s;o far from doing, our heartie&s;t wi&s;hes would be to &s;ee redre&s;&s;ed. This noble capital, the pride of England and of Europe, I believe no man is &s;o &s;trangely wicked as to de&s;ire to &s;ee de&s;troyed by a conflagra|tion or an earthquake, though he &s;hould be removed him&s;elf to the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the danger. But &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a fatal accident to have happened, what numbers from all parts would crowd to behold the ruins, and among&s;t them many who would have been content never to have &s;een London in its glory! Nor is it, either in real or fictitious di&s;tre&s;&s;es, our immunity from them which produces our delight; in my own mind I can di&s;cover nothing like it. I ap|prehend that this mi&s;take is owing to a &s;ort of &s;ophi&s;m, by which we are frequently impo&s;ed upon; it ari&s;es from our not di&s;tingui&s;hing between what is indeed a nece&s;&s;ary condition to our doing or &s;uffering any thing in general, and what is the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of &s;ome particular act. If a man kills me with a &s;word, it is a nece&s;&s;ary condition to this that we &s;hould have been both of us

alive before the fact; and yet it would be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that our being both living creatures was the cau&s;e of his crime and of my death.

There are two courts, and two intere&s;ts; both very different from the intere&s;ts of the people. The favourite knows that the regard of a tyrant is as uncon&s;tant and capricious as that of a woman; and concluding his time to be &s;hort, he makes ha&s;te to fill up the mea&s;ure of his iniquity, in

rapine, in luxury, and in revenge. Every avenue to the throne is &s;hut up. He oppre&s;&s;es, and ruins the people, whil&s;t he per&s;uades the prince, that tho&s;e murmurs rai&s;ed by his own oppre&s;&s;ion are the effects of di&s;affection to the prince's government.

I know this is by &s;ome con&s;idered as a fine thing for us. But the Athenians ought not to
<PB N="413" REF="239">
be better than the Engli&s;h, or Mr. Pitt le&s;s virtuous than Ari&s;tides.</P>
<P>Are we then &s;o poor in re&s;ources that we can do no better with eighteen or twenty &s;hips of the line than to burn them? Had we &s;ent for French Royali&s;t naval officers, of which &s;ome hundreds are to be had, and made them &s;elect &s;uch &s;eamen as they could tru&s;t, and filled the re&s;t with our own and Mediterranean &s;eamen, which are all over Italy, to be had by thou&s;ands, and put them under judicious Engli&s;h commanders in chief, and with a judicious mixture of our own &s;ubordinates, the We&s;t Indies would at this day have been ours. It may be &s;aid that the&s;e French officers would take them for the King of France, and that they would not be in our power. Be it &s;o. The i&s;lands would not be ours, but they would not be jacobinized. This is however a thing impo&s;&s;ible. They mu&s;t in effect and &s;ub&s;tance be ours. But all is upon that fal&s;e principle of di&s;tru&s;t, which, not confiding in &s;trength, can never have the full u&s;e of it. They that pay, and feed, and equip, mu&s;t direct. But I mu&s;t &s;peak plain upon this &s;ub|ject. The French i&s;lands, if they were all our own, ought not to be all kept. A fair partition only ought to be made of tho&s;e territories. This is a &s;ubject of policy very &s;erious, which has many relations and a&s;pects. Ju&s;t here I only hint at it as an&s;wering an objection, whil&s;t I &s;tate the mi&s;chievous con&s;equences which &s;uffer us to be &s;urprized into a virtual breach of faith, by confounding our ally with our enemy, becau&s;e they both belong to the &s;ame geographical territory.</P>
<P>My clear opinion is, that Toulon ought to be made, what we &s;et out with, a royal French city. By the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be under the influence, civil and military, of the allies. But the only way of keeping that jealous and di&s;cordant ma&s;s from tearing its component parts to pieces, and hazarding the lo&s;s of the whole, is to put the place into the no|minal

<P>Nothing is &s;o fatal to a nation as an extreme of &s;elf-partiality, and the total want of con&s;ideration of what others will naturally hope or fear.

But her mini&s;ters (to &s;ay the be&s;t of them) are vulgar politicians.

<PB N="415" REF="241">
monarchy? It &s;ignifies nothing whether we are wrong or right in the ab&s;tract; but in re&s;pect to our relation to Spain, with &s;uch principles followed up in prac|tice, it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible that any cordial alli|ance can &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the two nations. If Spain goes, Naples will &s;peedily follow. Pru&s;&s;ia is quite certain, and thinks of nothing but making a market of the pre&s;ent confu&s;ions. Italy is broken and di|vided; Switzerland is jacobinized, I am afraid, com|pletely. I have long &s;een with pain the progre&s;s of French principles in that country. Things cannot go on upon the pre&s;ent bottom. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Toulon, which, well managed, might be of the greate&s;t advantage, will be the greate&s;t misfortune that ever happened to this nation. The more we multiply troops there, the more we &s;hall multiply cau&s;es and means of quarrel among&s;t our&s;elves. I know but one way of avoiding it, which is to give a greater degree of &s;implicity to our politics. Our &s;ituation does nece&s;&s;arily render them a good deal involved. And, to this evil, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing it, we ought to apply all the remedies in our power.</P>
<P>See what is, in that place, the con&s;equence (to &s;ay nothing of every other) of this complexity. Toulon has, as it were, two gates, an Engli&s;h and a Spani&s;h. The Engli&s;h gate is, by our policy, fa&s;t barred again&s;t the entrance of any Royali&s;ts. The Spaniards open theirs, I fear, upon no fixed principle, and with very little judgment. By means, however, of this fooli&s;h, mean, and jealous policy on our &s;ide, all the Royali&s;ts whom the Engli&s;h might &s;elect as mo&s;t practicable, and mo&s;t &s;ub&s;ervient to hone&s;t views, are totally excluded. Of tho&s;e admitted, the Spaniards are ma&s;ters. As to the inhabitants they are a ne&s;t of Jacobins which is delivered into our hands, not from principle, but from fear. The inhabitants of Toulon may be de|&s;cribed in few words. It is <HI>differtum naulis, cauponi|bus atque malignis.</HI> The re&s;t of the &s;eaports are of the &s;ame de&s;cription.</P>
<P><PB N="416" REF="242">Another thing which I cannot account for is, the &s;ending for the bi&s;hop of Toulon, and afterwards forbidding his entrance. This is as directly contrary to the declaration, as it is to the practice of the allied powers. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia did better. When he took Verdun, he actually re-in&s;tated the bi&s;hop and his chapter. When he thought he &s;hould be the ma&s;ter of Chalons, he called the bi&s;hop from Flan|ders, to put him into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The Au&s;trians have re&s;tored the clergy wherever they obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. We have propo&s;ed to re&s;tore religion as well as mo|narchy; and in Toulon we have re&s;tored neither the one nor the other. It is very likely that the Jacobin Sans-Culottes, or &s;ome of them, objected to this mea&s;ure, who rather chu&s;e to have the athei&s;tic bu&s;|&s;oons of clergy they have got to &s;port with, till they are ready to come forward, with the re&s;t of their worthy brethren, in Paris and other places, to de|clare that they are a &s;et of impo&s;tors, that they never believed in God, and never will preach any &s;ort of religion. If we give way to our Jacobins in this point, it is fully and fairly putting the government, civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, not in the king of France, to whom, as the protector and governor, and in &s;ub|&s;tance the head of the Gallican church, the nomina|tion to the bi&s;hoprics belonged, and who made the bi&s;hop of Toulon; it does not leave it with him, or even in the hands of the king of England, or the king of Spain; but in the ba&s;e&s;t Jacobins of a low &s;ea-port, to exerci&s;e, <HI>pro tempore,</HI> the &s;overeignty. If this point of religion is thus given up, the grand in&s;trument for reclaiming France is abandoned.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Memorial on the Affairs of France in</HI> 1792.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>VARIATION, WHY BEAUTIFUL.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER principal property of beautiful objects is, that the line of their parts is continually varying its direction; but it varies it by a very in&s;en&s;ible de|viation; it never varies it &s;o quickly as to &s;urprize, or by the &s;harpne&s;s of its angle to cau&s;e any twitching or convul&s;ion of the optic nerve. Nothing long con|tinued in the &s;ame manner, nothing very &s;uddenly varied, can be beautiful; becau&s;e both are oppo&s;ite to that agreeable relaxation which is the characteri&s;tic effect of beauty. It is thus in all the &s;en&s;es. A motion in a right line, is that manner of moving next to a very gentle de&s;cent, in which we meet the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance; yet it is not that manner of moving, which, next to a de&s;cent, wearies us the lea&s;t. Re&s;t certainly tends to relax: yet there is a &s;pecies of motion which relaxes more than re&s;t; a gentle o&s;cillatory mo|tion, ari&s;ing and falling. Rocking &s;ets children to &s;leep better than ab&s;olute re&s;t; there is, indeed, &s;carce any thing at that age, which gives more plea&s;ure than to be gently lifted up and down; the manner of play|ing which their nur&s;es u&s;e with children, and the weighing and &s;winging u&s;ed afterwards by them&s;elves as a favourite amu&s;ement, evince this very &s;uffici|ently. Mo&s;t people mu&s;t have ob&s;erved the &s;ort of &s;en&s;e they have had, on being &s;wiftly drawn in an ea&s;y coach on a &s;mooth turf, with gradual a&s;cents and declivities. This will give a better idea of the beautiful, and point out its probable cau&s;e better, than almo&s;t any thing el&s;e. On the contrary, when one is hurried over a rough, rocky, broken road, the pain felt by the&s;e &s;udden inequalities &s;hews why
<PB N="418" REF="244">
&s;imilar &s;ights, feelings, and &s;ounds, are &s;o contrary to beauty: and with regard to the feeling, it is ex|actly the &s;ame in its effect, or very nearly the &s;ame, whether, for in&s;tance, I move my hand along the &s;ur|face of a body of a certain &s;hape, or whether &s;uch a body is moved along my hand. But to bring this analogy of the &s;en&s;es home to the eye: if a body pre|&s;ented to that &s;en&s;e has &s;uch a waving &s;urface, that the rays of light reflected from it are in a continual in&s;en&s;ible deviation from the &s;tronge&s;t to the weake&s;t (which is always the ca&s;e in a &s;urface gradually un|equal) it mu&s;t be exactly &s;imilar in its effect on the eye and touch; upon the one of which it operates directly, on the other indirectly. And this body will be beautiful if the lines which compo&s;e its &s;ur|face are not continued, even &s;o varied, in a man|ner that may weary or di&s;&s;ipate the attention.

<HEAD>VICINITY (CIVIL.) The Law of Civil Vicinity.</HEAD>
<P>DISTANCE of place does not extingui&s;h the duties or the rights of men; but it often renders their exer|ci&s;e impracticable. The &s;ame circum&s;tance of di&s;|tance renders the noxious effects of an evil &s;y&s;tem in any community le&s;s pernicious. But there are &s;itu|ations where this difficulty does not occur; and in which, therefore, the&s;e duties are obligatory, and the&s;e rights are to be a&s;&s;erted. It has ever been the method of public juri&s;ts to draw the analogies on which they form the law of nations, from the prin|ciples of law which prevail in civil community. Civil laws are not all of them merely po&s;itive. Tho&s;e which are rather conclu&s;ions of legal rea&s;on, than matters of &s;tatutable provi&s;ion, belong to univer&s;al equity, and are univer&s;ally applicable. Almo&s;t the whole praetorian law is &s;uch. There is a <HI>Law of Neighbourhood</HI> which does not leave a man perfect ma&s;ter on his own ground. When a neighbour &s;ees a <HI>new erection,</HI> in the nature of a nui&s;ance, &s;et up at his door, he has a right to repre&s;ent it to the Judge; who, on his part, has a right to order the work to be &s;taid; or if e&s;tabli&s;hed, to be removed. On this head, the parent law is expre&s;s and clear; and has made many wi&s;e provi&s;ions, which, without de&s;troy|ing, regulate and re&s;train the right of <HI>owner&s;hip</HI> by the right of <HI>vicinage.</HI> No <HI>innovation</HI> is permitted that may redound, even &s;econdarily, to the prejudice of a neighbour. The whole doctrine of that important head of praetorian law, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>De novi operis nunciatione,</HI>"</Q>
<PB N="420" REF="246">
is founded on the principle, that no <HI>new</HI> u&s;e &s;hould be made of a man's private liberty of operating upon his private property, from whence a detriment may be ju&s;tly apprehended by his neighbour. This law of denunciation is pro&s;pective. It is to anticipate what is called <HI>damnum infectum,</HI> or <HI>damnum nondum factum,</HI> that is a damage ju&s;tly apprehended but not actually done. Even before it is clearly known whe|ther the innovation be damageable or not, the Judge is competent to i&s;&s;ue a prohibition to innovate, until the point can be determined. This prompt interfe|rence is grounded on principles favourable to both parties. It is preventive of mi&s;chief difficult to be repaired, and of ill blood difficult to be &s;oftened.&mdash;The rule of law, therefore, which comes before the evil, is among&s;t the very be&s;t parts of equity, and ju&s;tifies the promptne&s;s of the remedy; becau&s;e, as it is well ob&s;erved, <HI>Res damni infecti celeritatem de&s;i|derat, &amp; periculo&s;a e&s;t dilatio.</HI> This right of denun|ciation does not hold, when things continue, how|ever inconveniently to the neighbourhood, according to the <HI>ancient</HI> mode. For there is a &s;ort of pre&s;ump|tion again&s;t novelty, drawn out of a deep con&s;idera|tion of human nature and human affairs; and the maxim of juri&s;prudence is well laid down, <HI>Velu&s;tas pro lege &s;emper habetur.</HI></P>
<P>Such is the law of civil vicinity. Now where there is no con&s;tituted Judge, as between independent &s;tates there is not, the vicinage it&s;elf is the natural judge. It is, preventively, the a&s;&s;ertor of its own rights, or remedially, their avenger. Neighbours are pre&s;umed to take cognizance of each other's acts. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Vicini, vi|cinorum &s;acta pre&s;umuntur &s;cire.</HI>"</Q> This principle, which, like the re&s;t, is as true of nations as of men, has be&s;towed on the grand vicinage of Europe, a duty to know, and a right to prevent, any capital innova|tion which may amount to the erection of a dangerous nui&s;ance. Of the importance of that innovation, and the mi&s;chief of that nui&s;ance, they are, to be &s;ure, bound to judge not litigiou&s;ly; but it is in their
<PB N="421" REF="247">
competence to judge. What in civil &s;ociety is a ground of action, in politic &s;ociety is a ground of war. But the exerci&s;e of that competent juri&s;dic|tion is a matter of moral prudence. As &s;uits in civil &s;ociety, &s;o war in the political, is ever a matter of great deliberation. It is not this or that particular proceeding picked out here and there, as a &s;ubject of quarrel, that will do.

<HEAD>WAR. View of War that touches our own Country.</HEAD>
<P>LET the portion of our hi&s;tory from the year 1689 to 1713 be brought before us. We &s;hall find, that in all that period of twenty-four years, there were not above &s;ix that could be called an interval of peace; and this interval was in reality nothing more than a very active preparation for war. During that period, every one of the propo&s;itions of peace came from the enemy. The fir&s;t, when they were ac|cepted, at the peace of Ry&s;wick. The &s;econd, where they were rejected at the congre&s;s at Gertru|denburgh. The la&s;t, when the war ended by the treaty of Utrecht. Even then, a very great part of the nation, and that which contained by far the mo&s;t intelligent &s;tate&s;men, was again&s;t the conclu&s;ion of the war. I do not enter into the merits of that que&s;|tion as between the parties. I only &s;tate the exi&s;tence of that opinion as a fact. I mention the length of the war as a proof, that though the countries which now compo&s;e the kingdom, for a part of the time were not united, and through all the time continued with a raw and ill cemented union, and though they were further &s;plit into parties as vehement, and more equally divided than now they are, and that we were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of far le&s;s abundant re&s;ources in all kinds than we now enjoy.&mdash;I mean to mark, that under all the&s;e di&s;advantages the Engli&s;h nation was then a great people; that we had then an high mind, and a con&s;tancy unconquerable; that we were then in&s;pired with no flu&s;hy pa&s;&s;ions, but &s;uch as were durable as well as warm; &s;uch as corre&s;ponded to the great intere&s;ts we had at &s;take. This force of character was in&s;pired, as all &s;uch &s;pirit mu&s;t ever be, from above. Government gave the impul&s;e. As well may we fancy that of it&s;elf the &s;ea will &s;well, and without winds the billows will in&s;ult the adver&s;e &s;hore, as that the gro&s;s ma&s;s of the people will be
<PB N="424" REF="250">
moved and elevated without the influence of &s;upe|rior authority, or &s;uperior mind.</P>
<P>This impul&s;e ought, in my opinion, to have been given in this war; and it ought to have been conti|nued to it at every in&s;tant. It is made, if ever war was made, to touch all the great &s;prings of action in the human brea&s;ts. It ought not to have been a war of apology. The mini&s;ter had, in this conflict, wherewithal to glory in &s;ucce&s;s; to be con&s;oled in adver&s;ity; to hold high his principle in all fortunes. If it were not given him to &s;upport the falling edi|fice, he ought to bury him&s;elf under the ruins of the civilized world. All the art of Greece, and all the pride and power of ea&s;tern monarchs, never heaped upon their a&s;hes &s;o grand a monument.</P>
<P>There were days when his great mind was up to the cri&s;is of the world he is called to act in. His manly eloquence was equal to the elevated wi&s;dom of &s;uch &s;entiments. But the little have triumphed over the great; and unnatural, not an unu&s;ual victory. I am &s;ure you cannot forget with how much unea&s;i|ne&s;s we heard in conver&s;ation, the language of more than one gentleman at the opening of this conte&s;t,
<Q REND="inline">"that he was willing to try the war for a year or two, and if it did not &s;ucceed, then to vote for peace."</Q>
As if war was a matter of experiment! As if you could take it up or lay it down as an idle frolic! As if the dire godde&s;s that pre&s;ides over it, with her murderous &s;pear in her hand, and her gor|gon at her brea&s;t, was a coquette to be flirted with! We ought with reverence to approach that tremendous divinity, that loves courage, but commands coun&s;el. War never leaves a nation where it was found. The interval between that and peace is, indeed,
<Q REND="inline">"a very hideous dream, in which the genius and the mortal in&s;truments are &s;eriou&s;ly at work."</Q>
It is never to be entered into without a mature deliberation; not a deliberation lengthened out into a perplexing indeci|&s;ion, but a deliberation leading to a &s;ure and fixed
<PB N="425" REF="251">
judgment. When &s;o taken up, it is not to be aban|doned without rea&s;on as valid, as fully, and as exten|&s;ively con&s;idered; for peace may be made as unad|vi&s;edly as war. Nothing is &s;o ra&s;h as fear; and the coun&s;els of pu&s;illanimity very rarely put off, whil&s;t they are always &s;ure to aggravate the evils they would fly from.</P>
<P>In that great war carried on again&s;t Louis the XIVth, for near eighteen years, Government &s;pared no pains to &s;atisfy the people, that though they were to be animated by a de&s;ire of glory, glory was not their ultimate object: but that every thing dear to them, in religion, in law, in liberty, every thing which as freemen, as Engli&s;hmen, and as citizens of the great commonwealth of Chri&s;tendom, they had at heart, was then at &s;take. Whether they did not exaggerate the danger I will not di&s;pute. A danger, and no &s;mall danger, unque&s;tionably there was; and that long and arduous war was pur&s;ued, upon at lea&s;t as &s;olid and manly grounds, as the peace was made which put an end to it. A danger to avert a danger&mdash;a pre&s;ent inconvenience and &s;uffering to prevent a fore&s;een future, and a wor&s;e calamity&mdash;the&s;e are the motives that belong to an animal, who, in his con&s;titution, is at once adventurous and provident; circum&s;pect, and daring; whom his Creator has made, as the Poet &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline">"of large di&s;cour&s;e, looking before and after."</Q>
But never can a vehement and &s;u&s;|tained &s;pirit of fortitude be kindled in a people by a war of calculation. It has nothing that can keep the mind erect under the gu&s;ts of adver&s;ity. Even where men are willing, as &s;ometimes they are, to barter their blood for lucre, to hazard their &s;afety to gratify their avarice, that pa&s;&s;ion, like all the pa&s;|&s;ions, mu&s;t &s;ee it's objects di&s;tinct and near at hand.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions are hungry and impatient. Specu|lative plunder; contingent &s;poil; future long ad|journed uncertain booty; pillage which mu&s;t enrich a late po&s;terity, and which po&s;&s;ibly may not reach to
<PB N="426" REF="252">
po&s;terity at all; the&s;e, for any length of time, will never &s;upport a mercenary war. The people are in the right. The calculation of profit in all &s;uch wars is fal&s;e. On balancing the account of &s;uch wars, ten thou&s;and hog&s;heads of &s;ugar are purcha&s;ed at ten thou&s;and times their price. The blood of man &s;hould never be &s;hed but to redeem the blood of man. It is well &s;hed for our family, for our friends, for our God, for our country, for our kind. The re&s;t is vanity; the re&s;t is crime.</P>
<P>In the war of the Grand Alliance, mo&s;t of the&s;e con&s;iderations voluntarily and naturally had their part. Some were pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice. The political intere&s;t ea&s;ily went in the track of the natural &s;enti|ment. In the rever&s;e cour&s;e the carriage does not follow freely. I am &s;ure the natural feeling, as I have ju&s;t &s;aid, is a far more predominant ingredient in this war, than in that of any other that ever was waged by this kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>WAR. The pre&s;ent a religious War.</HEAD>
<P>WE cannot, if we would, delude our&s;elves about the true &s;tate of this dreadful conte&s;t. It is a reli|gious war. It includes in its object undoubtedly every other intere&s;t of &s;ociety as well as this; but this is the principal and leading feature. It is through this de&s;truction of religion that our enemies propo&s;e the accompli&s;hment of all their other views. The French revolution, impious at once and fanatical, had no other plan for dome&s;tic power and foreign empire. Look at all the proceedings of the National A&s;&s;embly, from the fir&s;t day of declaring it&s;elf &s;uch in the year 1789, to this very hour, and you will find full half of their bu&s;ine&s;s to be directly on this &s;ub|ject. In fact it is the &s;pirit of the whole. The reli|gious &s;y&s;tem, called the con&s;titutional church, was on the face of the whole proceeding &s;et up only as a mere temporary amu&s;ement to the people, and &s;o con&s;tantly &s;tated in all their conver&s;ations, till the time &s;hould come, when they might with &s;afety ca&s;t off the very appearance of all religion what&s;oever, and per&s;ecute chri&s;tianity throughout Europe with fire and &s;word. The con&s;titutional clergy are not the mini&s;ters of any religion: they are the agents and in&s;truments of this horrible con&s;piracy again&s;t all morals. It was from a &s;en&s;e of this, that in the Eng|li&s;h addition to the articles propo&s;ed at St. Domingo, tolerating all religions, we very wi&s;ely refu&s;ed to &s;uffer that kind of traitors and buffoons.</P>
<P>This religious war is not a controver&s;y between &s;ect and &s;ect as formerly, but a war again&s;t all &s;ects and all religions. The que&s;tion is not whether you are to overturn the catholic, to &s;et up the prote&s;tant. Such an idea in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world is too contemptible. Our bu&s;ine&s;s is to leave to the &s;chools the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the controverted points, abating as much as we can the acrimony of di&s;pu|tants
<PB N="428" REF="254">
on all &s;ides. It is for chri&s;tian &s;tate&s;men, as the world is now circum&s;tanced, to &s;ecure their com|mon ba&s;is, and not to ri&s;que the &s;ubver&s;ion of the whole fabric by pur&s;uing the&s;e di&s;tinctions with an ill-timed zeal. We have in the pre&s;ent grand alli|ance, all modes of government as well as all modes of religion. In government, we mean to re&s;tore that which, notwith&s;tanding our diver&s;ity of forms we are all agreed in, as fundamental in government. The &s;ame principle ought to guide us in the religious part; conforming the mode, not to our particular ideas (for in that point we have no ideas in common) but to what will be&s;t promote the great general ends of the alliance. As &s;tate&s;men we are to &s;ee which of tho&s;e modes be&s;t &s;uits with the intere&s;ts of &s;uch a commonwealth as we wi&s;h to &s;ecure and promote. There can be no doubt, but that the catholic religion, which is fundamentally the religion of France, mu&s;t go with the Monarchy of France; we know that the Monarchy did not &s;urvive the Hierarchy, no not even in appearance, for many months; in &s;ub&s;tance, not for a &s;ingle hour. As little can it exi&s;t in fu|ture, if that pillar is taken away; or even &s;hattered and impaired.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Memorial on the Affairs of France in</HI> 1792.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>WALES. Sketch of Welch Hi&s;tory.</HEAD>
<P>MY next example is Wales. This country was &s;aid to be reduced by Henry the Third. It was &s;aid more truly to be &s;o by Edward the Fir&s;t. But though then conquered, it was not looked upon as any part of the realm of England. Its old con&s;titution, whatever that might have been, was de&s;troyed; and no good one was &s;ub&s;tituted in its place. The care of that tract was put into the hands of lords marchers&mdash;a form of government of a very &s;ingular kind; a &s;trange heterogeneous mon&s;ter, &s;omething between
<PB N="429" REF="255">
ho&s;tility and government; perhaps it has a &s;ort of re&s;emblance, according to the modes of tho&s;e times, to that of commander in chief at pre&s;ent, to whom all civil power is granted as &s;econdary. The man|ners of the Wel&s;h nation followed the genius of the government: the people were ferocious, re&s;tive, &s;a|vage, and uncultivated; &s;ometimes compo&s;ed, never pacified. Wales within it&s;elf, was in perpetual di&s;|order; and it kept the frontier of England in perpe|tual alarm. Benefits from it to the &s;tate, there were none. Wales was only known to England, by in|cur&s;ion and inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sir, during that &s;tate of things, parliament was not idle. They attempted to &s;ubdue the fierce &s;pirit of the Welch by all &s;orts of rigorous laws. They prohibited by &s;tatute the &s;ending all &s;orts of arms into Wales, as you prohibit by proclamation (with &s;omething more of doubt on the legality) the &s;ending arms to America. They di&s;armed the Wel&s;h by &s;ta|tute, as you attempted (but &s;till with more que&s;tion on the legality) to di&s;arm New England by an in&s;truc|tion. They made an act to drag offenders from Wales into England for trial, as you have done (but with more hard&s;hip) with regard to America. By another act, where one of the parties was an En|gli&s;hman, they ordained, that his trial &s;hould be always by Engli&s;h. They made acts to re&s;train trade, as you do; and they prevented the Wel&s;h from the u&s;e of fairs and markets, as you do the Americans from fi&s;heries and foreign ports. In &s;hort, when the &s;ta|tute-book was not quite &s;o much &s;welled as it is now, you find no le&s;s than fifteen acts of penal regulation on the &s;ubject of Wales.</P>
<P>Here we rub our hands&mdash;A fine body of prece|dents for the authority of parliament and the u&s;e of it!&mdash;I admit it fully; and pray add likewi&s;e to the&s;e precedents, that all the while, Wales rid this kingdom like an <HI>incubus;</HI> that it was an unprofitable and op|pre&s;&s;ive burthen; and that an Engli&s;hman travelling
<PB N="430" REF="256">
in that country could not go &s;ix yards from the high road without being murdered.</P>
<P>The march of the human mind is &s;low. Sir, it was not, until after two hundred years, di&s;covered, that by an eternal law, providence had decreed vexa|tion to violence; and poverty to rapine. Your an|ce&s;tors did however at length open their eyes to the ill hu&s;bandry of inju&s;tice. They found that the ty|ranny of a free people could of all tyrannies the lea&s;t be endured; and that laws made again&s;t an whole nation were not the mo&s;t effectual methods for &s;ecuring its obedience. Accordingly, in the twenty-&s;eventh year of Henry VIII. the cour&s;e was entirely altered. With a preamble &s;tating the entire and perfect rights of the crown of England, it gave to the Wel&s;h all the rights and privileges of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects. A political order was e&s;tabli&s;hed; the mi|litary power gave way to the civil; the marches were turned into counties. But that a nation &s;hould have a right to Engli&s;h liberties, and yet no &s;hare at all in the fundamental &s;ecurity of the&s;e liberties, the grant of their own property, &s;eemed a thing &s;o incongru|ous, that eight years after, that is, in the thirty-fifth of that reign, a complete and not ill-proportioned repre&s;entation by counties and boroughs was be|&s;towed upon Wales, by act of parliament. From that moment, as by a charm, the tumults &s;ub&s;ided; obedience was re&s;tored; peace, order, and civiliza|tion, followed in the train of liberty.&mdash;When the day-&s;tar of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution had ari&s;en in their hearts, all was harmony within and without&mdash;<Q><L>Simul alba nautis</L>

<HEAD>WEALTH OF FRANCE IN 1785.</HEAD>
<P>THE wealth of a country is another, and no con|temptible &s;tandard, by which me may judge whether, on the whole, a government be protecting or de&s;truc|tive. France far exceeds England in the multitude of her people; but I apprehend that her comparative wealth is much inferior to ours; that it is not &s;o equal in the di&s;tribution, nor &s;o ready in the circu|lation. I believe the difference in the form of the two governments to be among&s;t the cau&s;es of this ad|vantage on the &s;ide of England. I &s;peak of Eng|land, not of the whole Briti&s;h dominions; which, if compared with tho&s;e of France, will, in &s;ome de|gree, weaken the comparative rate of wealth upon our &s;ide. But that wealth, which will not endure a compari&s;on with the riches of England, may con&s;ti|tute a very re&s;pectable degree of opulence. Mr. Necker's book publi&s;hed in 1785, contains an accu|rate and intere&s;ting collection of facts relative to public oeconomy and to political arithmetic; and his &s;peculations on the &s;ubject are in general wi&s;e and liberal. In that work he gives an idea of the &s;tate of France, very remote from the portrait of a coun|try who&s;e government was a perfect grievance, an ab&s;olute evil, admitting no cure but through the vio|lent and uncertain remedy of a total revolution. He affirms, that from the year 1726 to the year 1784, there was coined at the mint of France, in the &s;pe|cies of gold and &s;ilver, to the amount of about one hundred millions of pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible that Mr. Necker &s;hould be mi&s;taken in the amount of the bullion which has been coined
<PB N="432" REF="258">
in the mint. It is a matter of official record. The rea&s;onings of this able financier, concerning the quantity of gold and &s;ilver which remained for cir|culation, when he wrote in 1785, that is about four years before the depo&s;ition and impri&s;onment of the French king, are not of equal certainty; but they are laid on grounds &s;o apparently &s;olid, that it is not ea&s;y to refu&s;e a con&s;iderable degree of a&s;&s;ent to his calculation. He calculates the <HI>numeraire,</HI> or what we call <HI>&s;pecie,</HI> then actually exi&s;ting in France, at about eighty-eight millions of the &s;ame Engli&s;h mo|ney. A great accumulation of wealth for one coun|try, large as that country is? Mr. Neckar was &s;o far from con&s;idering this influx of wealth as likely to cea&s;e, when he wrote in 1785, that he pre&s;umes upon a future annual increa&s;e of two per cent. upon the money brought into France during the periods from which he computed.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Reflections on the Revolution in France.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>WORDS. How Words influence the Pa&s;&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>NOW, as words affect, not by any original power, but by repre&s;entation, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed that their influence over the pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould be but light; yet it is quite otherwi&s;e; for we find by experience that elo|quence and poetry are as capable, nay indeed much more capable, of making deep and lively impre&s;&s;ions than any other arts, and even than nature it&s;elf, in very many ca&s;es. And this ari&s;es chiefly from the&s;e three cau&s;es. Fir&s;t, that we take an extraordinary part in the pa&s;&s;ions of others, and that we are ea&s;ily affected and brought into &s;ympathy by any tokens which are &s;hewn of them; and there are no tokens which can expre&s;s all the circum&s;tances of mo&s;t pa&s;|&s;ions &s;o fully as words; &s;o that if a per&s;on &s;peaks upon any &s;ubject, he can not only convey the &s;ubject to you, but likewi&s;e the manner in which he is him&s;elf
<PB N="433" REF="259">
affected by it. Certain it is, that the influence of mo&s;t things on our pa&s;&s;ions, is not &s;o much from the things them&s;elves, as from our opinions concerning them; and the&s;e again depend very much on the opi|nions of other men, conveyable for the mo&s;t part by words only. Secondly, there are many things of a very affecting nature, which can &s;eldom occur in the reality, but the words which repre&s;ent them often do; and thus they have an opportunity of making a deep impre&s;&s;ion, and taking root in the mind, whil&s;t the idea of the reality was tran&s;ient; and to &s;ome perhaps never really occurred in any &s;hape, to whom it is, not|with&s;tanding, very affecting, as war, death, famine, &amp;c. Be&s;ides, many ideas have never been at all pre&s;ented to the &s;en&s;es of any men but by words, as God, angels, devils, heaven, and hell, all of which have however a great influence over the pa&s;&s;ions. Thirdly, by words we have it in our power to make &s;uch <HI>combinations</HI> as we cannot po&s;&s;ibly do otherwi&s;e. By this power of combining we are able, by the addi|tion of well-cho&s;en circum&s;tances, to give a new life and force to the &s;imple object. In painting we may repre&s;ent any fine figure we plea&s;e; but we never can give it tho&s;e enlivening touches which it may receive from words. To repre&s;ent an angel in a picture, you can only draw a beautiful young man winged; but what painting can furni&s;h out any thing &s;o grand as the addition of one word, <Q REND="inline">"the angel of the <HI>Lord</HI>?"</Q> It is true, I have here no clear idea; but the&s;e words affect the mind more than the &s;en&s;ible image did, which is all I contend for. A picture of Priam dragged to the altar's foot, and there murdered, if it were well executed, would undoubtedly be very moving; but there are very aggravating circum|&s;tances, which it could never repre&s;ent:
<Q><L>Sanguine foedantem <HI>quos ip&s;e &s;acraverat</HI> ignes.</L></Q>
As a further in&s;tance, let us con&s;ider tho&s;e lines of Milton, where he de&s;cribes the travels of the fallen angels through their di&s;mal habitation;
<Q><PB N="434" REF="260">
<L>&mdash;O'er many a dark and dreary vale</L>
<L>They pa&s;s'd, and many a region dolorous;</L>
<L>O'er many a frozen, many a fiery Alp;</L>
<L>Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and &s;hades of death,</L>
<L>A univer&s;e of death.</L></Q>
Here is di&s;played the force of union in
<Q><L>Rocks, caves, lakes, dens, bogs, fens, and &s;hades;</L></Q>
which yet would lo&s;e the greate&s;t part of the effect, if they were not the
<Q><L>Rocks, caves, lakes, dens, bogs, fens, and &s;hades&mdash;</L>
<L>&mdash;of <HI>Death.</HI></L></Q>
This idea, or this affection cau&s;ed by a word, which nothing but a word could annex to the others, rai&s;es a very great degree of the &s;ublime; and this &s;ublime is rai&s;ed yet higher by what follows, a <Q REND="inline">"<HI>univer&s;e of Death.</HI>"</Q> Here are again two ideas not pre&s;entable but by language; and an union of them great and amazing beyond conception; if they may properly be called ideas which pre&s;ent no di&s;tinct image to the mind;&mdash;but &s;till it will be difficult to conceive how words can move the pa&s;&s;ions which belong to real objects, without repre&s;enting the&s;e objects clearly. This is difficult to us, becau&s;e we do not &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h, in our ob&s;ervations upon lan|guage, between a clear expre&s;&s;ion, and a &s;trong ex|pre&s;&s;ion. The&s;e are frequently confounded with each other, though they are in reality extremely different. The former regards the under&s;tanding; the latter be|longs to the pa&s;&s;ions. The one de&s;cribes a thing as it is; the other de&s;cribes it as it is felt. Now, as there is a moving tone of voice, an impa&s;&s;ioned countenance, an agitated ge&s;ture, which affect inde|pendently of the things about which they are exerted, &s;o there are words, and certain di&s;po&s;itions of words, which being peculiarly devoted to pa&s;&s;ionate &s;ubjects, and always u&s;ed by tho&s;e who are under the influence of any pa&s;&s;ion, touch and move us more than tho&s;e
<PB N="435" REF="261">
which far more clearly and di&s;tinctly expre&s;s the &s;ub|ject matter. We yield to &s;ympathy what we refu&s;e to de&s;cription. The truth is, all verbal de&s;cription, merely as naked de&s;cription, though never &s;o exact, conveys &s;o poor and in&s;ufficient an idea of the thing de&s;cribed, that it could &s;carcely have the &s;malle&s;t effect, if the &s;peaker did not call in to his aid tho&s;e modes of &s;peech that mark a &s;trong and lively feeling in him&s;elf. Then, by the contagion of our pa&s;&s;ions, we catch a fire already kindled in another, which probably might never have been &s;truck out by the object de&s;cribed. Words, by &s;trongly conveying the pa&s;&s;ions, by tho&s;e means which we have already men|tioned, fully compen&s;ate for their weakne&s;s in other re&s;pects. It may be ob&s;erved, that very poli&s;hed languages, and &s;uch as are prai&s;ed for their &s;uperior clearne&s;s and per&s;picuity, are generally deficient in &s;trength. The French language has that perfection and that defect. Whereas the oriental tongues, and in general the languages of mo&s;t unpoli&s;hed people, have a great force and energy of expre&s;&s;ion; and this is but natural. Uncultivated people are but ordinary ob&s;ervers of things, and not critical in di&s;tingui&s;hing them; but, for that rea&s;on, they admire more, and are more affected with what they &s;ee, and therefore expre&s;s them&s;elves in a warmer and more pa&s;&s;ionate manner. If the affection be well conveyed, it will work its effect without any clear idea; often without any idea at all of the thing which has originally given ri&s;e to it.</P>
<P>It might be expected from the fertility of the &s;ub|ject, that I &s;hould con&s;ider poetry as it regards the &s;ublime and beautiful more at large; but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that in this light it has been often and well handled already. It was not my de&s;ign to enter into the critici&s;m of the &s;ublime and beautiful in any art, but to attempt to lay down &s;uch principles as may tend to a&s;certain, to di&s;tingui&s;h and to form a &s;ort of &s;tandard for them; which purpo&s;es I thought
<PB N="436" REF="262">
might be be&s;t effected by an enquiry into the por|perties of &s;uch things in nature, as rai&s;e love and a&s;toni&s;hment in us; and by &s;hewing in what manner they operated to produce the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. Words were only &s;o far to be con&s;idered, as to &s;hew upon what principle they were capable of being the repre|&s;entatives of the&s;e natural things, and by what powers they were able to affect us often as &s;trongly as the things they repre&s;ent, and &s;ometimes much more &s;trongly.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Sublime and Beautiful.</HI></BIBL></P>

<P>The Whigs of tho&s;e days believed that the only proper method of ri&s;ing into power, was through hard e&s;&s;ays of practi&s;ed friend&s;hip and experimented fidelity.

They were not of that ingenious paradoxical morality, to imagine that a &s;pirit of moderation was properly &s;hewn in patiently bearing the &s;ufferings of your friends; or that di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s was clearly manife&s;ted at the expence of other people's fortune.

<HEAD>WIT AND JUDGMENT.</HEAD>
<P>MR. LOCKE very ju&s;tly and finely ob&s;erves of wit, that it is chiefly conver&s;ant in tracing re&s;emblances: he remarks at the &s;ame time, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of judg|ment is rather in finding differences. It may perhaps appear, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, that there is no material di&s;tinction between the wit and the judgment, as they both &s;eem to re&s;ult from different operations of the &s;ame faculty of <HI>comparing.</HI> But in reality, whether they are or are not dependant on the &s;ame power of the mind, they differ &s;o very materially in many re|&s;pects, that a perfect union of wit and judgment is one of the rare&s;t things in the world. When two di&s;tinct objects are unlike to each other, it is only what we expect; things are in their common way; and therefore they make no impre&s;&s;ion on the imagi|nation: but when two di&s;tinct objects have a re&s;em|blance, we are &s;truck, we attend to them, and we are plea&s;ed. The mind of man has naturally a far greater alacrity and &s;atisfaction in tracing re&s;emblances than in &s;earching for differences; becau&s;e by making re&s;emblances we produce <HI>new images;</HI> we unite, we create, we enlarge our &s;tock; but in making di&s;tinc|tions, we offer no food at all to the imagination; the ta&s;k it&s;elf is more &s;evere and irk&s;ome, and what plea|&s;ure we derive from it is &s;omething of a negative and indirect nature. A piece of news is told me in the morning; this, merely as a piece of news, as a fact added to my &s;tock, gives me &s;ome plea&s;ure. In the evening I find there was nothing in it. What do I gain by this, but the di&s;&s;atisfaction to find that I had been impo&s;ed upon? Hence it is that men are much
<PB N="440" REF="266">
more naturally inclined to belief than to incredulity. And it is upon this principle, that the mo&s;t ignorant and barbarous nations have frequently excelled in &s;imilitudes, compari&s;ons, metaphors, and allegories, who have been weak and backward in di&s;tingui&s;hing and &s;orting their ideas. And it is for a rea&s;on of this kind, that Homer and the Oriental writers, though very fond of &s;imilitudes, and though they often &s;trike out &s;uch as are truly admirable, they &s;eldom take care to have them exact; that is, they are taken with the general re&s;emblance; they paint it &s;trongly, and they take no notice of the difference which may be found between the things compared.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Sublime and Beautiful.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>WILL AND DUTY. The Author of our Being has di&s;po&s;ed us not according to our Will but his own.</HEAD>
<P>I CANNOT too often recommend it to the &s;erious con&s;ideration of all men, who think civil &s;ociety to be within the province of moral juri&s;diction, that if we owe to it any duty, it is not &s;ubject to our will. Duties are not voluntary. Duty and will are even contradictory terms. Now, though &s;ociety might be at fir&s;t a voluntary act (which in many ca&s;es it undoubtedly was) it continues under a permanent &s;tanding covenant, co-exi&s;ting with the &s;ociety; and it attaches upon every individual of that &s;ociety, without any formal act of his own. This is war|ranted by the general practice, ari&s;ing out of the general &s;en&s;e of mankind. Men without their choice derive benefits from that a&s;&s;ociation; without their choice they are &s;ubjected to duties in con&s;equence of the&s;e benefits; and without their choice they enter into a virtual obligation as binding as any that is actual. Look through the whole of life and the whole &s;y&s;tem of duties. Much the &s;tronge&s;t moral obligations are &s;uch as were never the re&s;ults of our option. I allow, that if no &s;upreme ruler exi&s;ts, wi&s;e to form, and potent to enforce, the moral law, there
<PB N="441" REF="267">
is no &s;anction to any contract, virtual or even actual, again&s;t the will of prevalent power. On that hypo|the&s;is, let any &s;et of men be &s;trong enough to &s;et their duties at defiance, and they cea&s;e to be duties any longer. We have but this one appeal again&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible power&mdash;<Q><L>Si genus humanum et mortalia temnitis arma,</L>
<L>At &s;perate Deos memores fandi atque nefandi.</L></Q>
Taking it for granted that I do not write to the di&s;|ciples of the Pari&s;ian philo&s;ophy, I may a&s;&s;ume, that the awful author of our being is the author of our place in the order of exi&s;tence; and that having di&s;|po&s;ed and mar&s;halled us by a divine tactic, not ac|cording to our will, but according to his, he has, in and by that di&s;po&s;ition, virtually &s;ubjected us to act the part which belongs to the place a&s;&s;igned us. We have obligations to mankind at large, which are not in con&s;equence of any &s;pecial voluntary pact. They ari&s;e from the relation of man to man, and the rela|tion of man to God, which relations are not matters of choice. On the contrary, the force of all the pacts which we enter into with any particular per&s;on among&s;t them, depends upon tho&s;e prior obligations. In &s;ome ca&s;es the &s;ubordinate relations are voluntary, in others they are nece&s;&s;ary, but the duties are all compul&s;ive. When we marry, the choice is volun|tary, but the duties are not matter of choice. They are dictated by the nature of the &s;ituation. Dark and in&s;crutable are the ways by which we come into the world. The in&s;tincts which give ri&s;e to this my&s;|terious proce&s;s of nature are not of our making. But out of phy&s;ical cau&s;es, unknown to us, perhaps un|knowable, ari&s;e moral duties, which, as we are able perfectly to comprehend, we are bound indi&s;pen&s;ably to perform. Children are not con&s;enting to their re|lation, but their relation, without their actual con|&s;ent, binds them to its duties; or rather it implies their con&s;ent, becau&s;e the pre&s;umed con&s;ent of every rational creature is in uni&s;on with the predi&s;po&s;ed
<PB N="442" REF="268">
order of things. Men come in that manner into a community with the &s;ocial &s;tate of their parents, en|dowed with all the benefits, loaded with all the duties of their &s;ituation. If the &s;ocial ties and ligaments, &s;pun out of tho&s;e phy&s;ical relations which are the ele|ments of the commonwealth, in mo&s;t ca&s;es begin, and always continue, independently of our will, &s;o does that relation called our country, which comprehends (as it has been well &s;aid) <Q REND="inline">"all the charities of all,"</Q> bind us without any &s;tipulation on our part. Nor are we left without powerful in&s;tincts to make this duty as dear and grateful to us, as it is awful and coercive. Our country is not a thing of mere phy&s;ical locality. It con&s;i&s;ts, in a great mea&s;ure, in the ancient order into which we are born. We may have the &s;ame geographical &s;ituation, but another country; as we may have the &s;ame country in another &s;oil.

<HEAD>BENFIELD (PAUL, <ABBR>ESQ</ABBR>)</HEAD>
<P>OUR wonderful mini&s;ter, as you all know, formed a new plan, a plan <HI>in&s;igne recens alio indictum ore,</HI> a plan for &s;upporting the freedom of our con&s;titution by court intrigues, and for removing its corruptions by Indian delinquency. To carry that bold para|doxical de&s;ign into execution, &s;ufficient funds and apt in&s;truments became nece&s;&s;ary. You are perfectly &s;en&s;ible that a parliamentary reform occupies his thoughts day and night, as an e&s;&s;ential member in this extraordinary project. In his anxious re&s;earches upon this &s;ubject, natural in&s;tinct, as well as &s;ound policy, would direct his eyes, and &s;ettle his choice on Paul Benfield. Paul Benfield is the grand par|liamentary
<PB N="445" REF="271">
reformer, the reformer to whom the whole choir of reformers bow, and to whom even the right honourable gentleman him&s;elf mu&s;t yield the palm: For what region in the empire, what city, what bo|rough, what county, what tribunal, in this kingdom, is not full of his labours. Others have been only &s;peculators; he is the grand practical reformer; and whil&s;t the chancellor of the exchequer pledges in vain the man and the mini&s;ter, to increa&s;e the pro|vincial members, Mr. Benfield has au&s;piciou&s;ly and practically begun it. Leaving far behind him even Lord Camelford's generous de&s;ign of be&s;towing Old Sarum on the Bank of England, Mr. Benfield has thrown in the borough of Cricklade to reinforce the county repre&s;entation. Not content with this, in order to &s;tation a &s;teady phalanx for all future re|forms, this public-&s;pirited u&s;urer, amid&s;t his cha|ritable toils for the relief of India, did not forget the poor rotten con&s;titution of his native country. For her, he did not di&s;dain to &s;toop to the trade of a whole&s;ale uphol&s;terer for this hou&s;e, to furni&s;h it, not with the faded tape&s;try figures of antiquated merit, &s;uch as decorate, and may reproach &s;ome other hou&s;es, but with real, &s;olid, living patterns of true modern virtue. Paul Benfield made (reckoning him&s;elf) no fewer than eight members in the la&s;t parliament. What copious &s;treams of pure blood mu&s;t he not have transfu&s;ed into the veins of the pre&s;ent!</P>
<P>But what is even more &s;triking than the real &s;er|vices of this new imported patriot, is his mode&s;ty. As &s;oon as he had conferred this benefit on the con|&s;titution, he withdrew him&s;elf from our applau&s;e. He conceived that the duties of a member of parliament (which with the elect faithful, the true believers, the <HI>I&s;lam</HI> of parliamentary reform, are of little or no merit, perhaps not much better than &s;pecious &s;ins) might be as well attended to in India as in England, and the means of reformation to parliament it&s;elf, be
<PB N="446" REF="272">
far better provided. Mr. Benfield was therefore no &s;ooner elected than he &s;et off for Madras, and de|frauded the longing eyes of parliament. We have never enjoyed in this hou&s;e the luxury of beholding that minion of the human race, and contemplating that vi&s;age, which has &s;o long reflected the happine&s;s of nations.</P>
<P>It was therefore not po&s;&s;ible for the mini&s;ter to con&s;ult per&s;onally with this great man. What then was he do? Through a &s;agacity that never failed him in the&s;e pur&s;uits, he found out in Mr. Benfield's re|pre&s;entative, his exact re&s;emblance. A &s;pecific at|traction by which he gravitates towards all &s;uch cha|racters, &s;oon brought our mini&s;ter into a clo&s;e con|nexion with Mr. Benfield's agent and attorney; that is, with the grand contractor (whom I name to ho|nour) Mr. Richard Atkin&s;on; a name that will be well remembered as long as the records of this hou&s;e, as long as the records of the Birti&s;h trea&s;ury, as long as the monumental debt of England &s;hall endure.</P>
<P>This gentleman, Sir, acts as attorney for Mr. Paul Benfield. Every one who hears me, is well ac|quainted with the &s;acred friend&s;hip, and the &s;teady mutual attachment that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between him and the pre&s;ent mini&s;ter. As many members as cho&s;e to attend in the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of this parliament, can be&s;t tell their own feelings at the &s;cenes which were then acted. How much that honourable gentleman was con&s;ulted in the original frame and fabric of the bill, commonly called Mr. Pitt's India bill, is mat|ter only of conjecture; though by no means difficult to divine. But the public was an indignant witne&s;s of the o&s;tentation with which that mea&s;ure was made his own, and the authority with which he brought up clau&s;e after clau&s;e, to &s;tuff and fatten the rankne&s;s of that corrupt act. As fa&s;t as the clau&s;es were brought up to the table, they were accepted. No he&s;itation; no di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. They were received by the new mini&s;ter, not with approbation, but with
<PB N="447" REF="273">
implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The reformation may be e&s;ti|mated, by &s;eeing who was the reformer. Paul Ben|field's a&s;&s;ociate and agent was held up to the world as legi&s;lator of Indo&s;tan. But it was nece&s;&s;ary to authenticate the coalition between the men of in|trigue in India, and the mini&s;ter of intrigue in Eng|land, by a &s;tudied di&s;play of the power of this their connecting link. Every tru&s;t, every honour, every di&s;tinction, was to be heaped upon him. He was at once made a director of the India company; made an alderman of London; and to be made, if mini&s;try could prevail (and I am &s;orry to &s;ay how near, how very near they were prevailing) repre&s;entative of the capital of this kingdom. But to &s;ecure his &s;ervices again&s;t all ri&s;que, he was brought in for a mini&s;terial borough. On his part, he was not wanting in zeal for the common cau&s;e. His adverti&s;ements &s;hew his motives, and the merits upon which he &s;tood. For your mini&s;ter, this worn-out veteran &s;ubmitted to enter into the du&s;ty field of the London conte&s;t; and you all remember, that in the &s;ame virtuous cau&s;e, he &s;ubmitted to keep a &s;ort of public office or counting-hou&s;e, where the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the la&s;t general election was managed. It was openly managed by the direct agent and attorney of Ben|field. It was managed upon Indian principles, and for an Indian intere&s;t. This was the golden cup of abominations; this the chalice of the fornifications of rapine, u&s;ury, and oppre&s;&s;ion, which was held out by the gorgeous ea&s;tern harlot; which &s;o many of the people, &s;o many of the nobles of this land, had drained to the very dregs. Do you think that no reckoning was to follow this lewd debauch? that no payment was to be demanded for this riot of public drunkenne&s;s and national pro&s;titution? Here! you have it here before you. The principal of the grand election manager mu&s;t be indemnified; accordingly the claims of Benfield and his crew mu&s;t be put above all enquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="448" REF="274">For &s;everal years, Benfield appeared as the chief proprietor, as well as the chief agent, director, and controller, of this &s;y&s;tem of debt.

Eight hundred thou&s;and had been mentioned &s;ome time before<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Madras corre&s;pondence on this &s;ubject.</NOTE>; and according to the practice of &s;hifting the names of creditors in the&s;e tran&s;actions, and reducing or rai&s;ing the debt it&s;elf at plea&s;ure, I think it not impo&s;&s;ible, that at one period, the name of Benfield might have &s;tood before tho&s;e frightful figures. But my be&s;t informa|tion goes to fix his &s;hare no higher than four hundred thou&s;and pounds. By the &s;cheme of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try for adding to the principal twelve <HI>per cent.</HI> from the year 1777 to the year 1781, four hundred thou&s;and pounds, that &s;malle&s;t of the &s;ums ever mentioned for Mr. Benfield, will form a capital of &pound;592,000, at &s;ix <HI>per cent.</HI> Thus, be&s;ides the arrears of three years, amounting to &pound;106,500 (which, as fa&s;t as received, may be legally lent out at 12 <HI>per cent.</HI>) Benfield has received, by the mini&s;terial grant before you, an annuity of &pound;35,520 a year, charged on the public revenues.</P>
<P>Our mirror of mini&s;ters of finance, did not think this enough for the &s;ervices of &s;uch a friend as Ben|field. He found that Lord Macartney, in order to frighten the court of directors from the project, of obliging the nabob to give &s;oucar &s;ecurity for his debt, a&s;&s;uring them, that if they &s;hould take that &s;tep, Benfield<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Appendix, No. 5, A.</NOTE> would infallibly be the &s;oucar; and would thereby become the entire ma&s;ter of the Car|natic. What Lord Macartney thought &s;ufficient to deter the very agents and partakers with Benfield
<PB N="449" REF="275">
in his iniquities, was the inducement to the two right honourable gentlemen to order this very &s;oucar &s;ecu|rity to be given, and to recall Benfield to the city of Madras, from the &s;ort of decent exile, into which he had been relegated by Lord Macartney. You mu&s;t therefore con&s;ider Benfield, as &s;oucar &s;ecurity for &pound;480,000 a year, which at twenty-four <HI>per cent.</HI> (&s;uppo&s;ing him contented with that profit) will, with the intere&s;t of his old debt, produce an annual in|come of &pound;149,520 a year.</P>
<P>Here is a &s;pecimen of the new and pure ari&s;to|cracy created by the right honourable gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Right Honourable William Pitt.</NOTE>, as the &s;upport of the crown and con&s;titution, again&s;t the old, corrupt, refractory, natural intere&s;ts of this kingdom; and this is the grand counterpoi&s;e again&s;t all odious coalitions of the&s;e intere&s;ts.

He had been employed by his ma&s;ter, the Lieutenant de Police, for a con&s;iderable time in London, in the &s;ame or &s;ome &s;uch honourable occupation. The revolution, which has brought forward all merit of that kind, rai&s;ed him, with others of a &s;imilar cla&s;s and di&s;po&s;ition, to fame and eminence. On the re|volution, he became a publi&s;her of an infamous new&s;paper, which he &s;till continues. He is charged,

and I believe ju&s;tly, as the fir&s;t mover of the troubles in Hi&s;paniola. There is no wickedne&s;s, if I am rightly informed, in which he is not ver&s;ed, and of which he is not perfectly capable. His quality of news-writer, now an employment of the fir&s;t dignity in France, and his practices and principles, procured his election into the a&s;&s;embly, where he is one of the leading members.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Memorial on the Affairs of France in</HI> 1793.</BIBL></P>

<P>CONDORCET (though no marquis, as he &s;tyled him&s;elf before the revolution) is a man of another &s;ort of birth, fa&s;hion, and occupation from Bri&s;&s;ot; but in every principle, and in every di&s;po&s;ition to the lowe&s;t as well as the highe&s;t and mo&s;t determined villainies, fully his equal. He &s;econds Bri&s;&s;ot in the A&s;&s;embly, and is at once his coadjutor and his rival in a new&s;paper, which in his own name, and as &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Mr. Garat, a member al&s;o of the a&s;&s;em|bly, he has ju&s;t &s;et up in that Empire of Gazettes. Condorcet was cho&s;en to draw the fir&s;t declaration pre&s;ented by the A&s;&s;embly to the King, as a threat to the Elector of Treves, and the other princes on the Rhine. In that piece, in which both Feuillans and Jacobins concurred, they declared publicly, and mo&s;t proudly and in&s;olently, the principle on which they mean to proceed in their future di&s;putes with any of the Sovereigns in Europe, for they &s;ay,

<P>The late A&s;&s;embly, after the la&s;t captivity of the King, had actually cho&s;en this Condorcet by a ma|jority on the ballot, for Preceptor to the Dauphin, who was to be taken out of the hands and direction of his parents, and to be delivered over to this fana|tic Athei&s;t, and furious democratic Republican. His
<PB N="452" REF="278">
untractability to the&s;e leaders, and his figure in the Club of Jacobins, which at that time they wi&s;hed to bring under, alone prevented that part of the ar|rangement, and others in the &s;ame &s;tyle, from being carried into execution. Whil&s;t he was candidate for this office, he produced his title to it by promul|gating the following ideas of the title of his royal pupil to the crown. In a paper written by him, and publi&s;hed with his name, again&s;t the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, even of the appearance of monarchy under any qualifications, He &s;ays,

with the freedom of hi&s;tory, and I hope without offence. One or two of the&s;e maxims, flowing from an opinion not the mo&s;t indulgent to our unhappy &s;pecies, and &s;urely a little too general, led him into mea&s;ures that were greatly mi&s;chievous to him&s;elf; and for that rea&s;on, among others, perhaps fatal to his country; mea&s;ures, the effects of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> which, I am afraid, are for ever incurable.

<P>AND now, having done my duty to the bill, let me &s;ay a word to the author. I &s;hould leave him to his own noble &s;entiments, if the unworthy and il|liberal language with which he has been treated, be|yond all example of parliamentary liberty, did not make a few words nece&s;&s;ary; not &s;o much in ju&s;tice to him, as to my own feelings. I mu&s;t &s;ay then, that it will be a di&s;tinction honourable to the age, that the re&s;cue of the greate&s;t number of the human race that ever were &s;o grievou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed, from the greate&s;t tyranny that was ever exerci&s;ed, has fallen to the lot of abilities and di&s;po&s;itions equal to the ta&s;k; that it has fallen to one who has the enlarge|ment to comprehend, the &s;pirit to undertake, and the eloquence to &s;upport, &s;o great a mea&s;ure of hazard|ous benevolence. His &s;pirit is not owing to his igno|rance of the &s;tate of men and things; he well knows what &s;nares are &s;pread about his path, from per&s;onal animo&s;ity, from court intrigues, and po&s;&s;ibly from popular delu&s;ion. But he has put to hazard his ea&s;e, his &s;ecurity, his intere&s;t, his power, even his darling popularity, for the benefit of a people whom he has
<PB N="460" REF="286">
never &s;een. This is the road that all heroes have trod before him. He is traduced and abu&s;ed for his &s;uppo&s;ed motives. He will remember, that obloquy is a nece&s;&s;ary ingredient in the compo&s;ition of all true glory: he will remember, that it was not only in the Roman cu&s;toms, but it is in the nature and con&s;titution of things, that calumny and abu&s;e are e&s;&s;ential parts of triumph. The&s;e thoughts will &s;up|port a mind, which only exi&s;ts for honour, under the burthen of temporary reproach. He is doing indeed a great good; &s;uch as rarely falls to the lot, and almo&s;t as rarely coincides with the de&s;ires of any man. Let him u&s;e his time. Let him give the whole length of the reins to his benevolence. He is now on a great eminence, where the eyes of mankind are turned to him. He may live long, he may do much. But here is the &s;ummit. He never can exceed what he does this day.</P>
<P>He has faults; but they are faults that, though they may in a &s;mall degree tarni&s;h the lu&s;tre, and &s;ometimes impede the march of his abilities, have nothing in them to extingui&s;h the fire of great virtues. In tho&s;e faults, there is no mixture of deceit, of hypocri&s;y, of pride, of ferocity, of complexional de&s;poti&s;m, or want of feeling for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of mankind. His are faults which might exi&s;t in a de|&s;cendant of Henry the Fourth of France, as they did exi&s;t in that father of his country. Henry the Fourth wi&s;hed that he might live to &s;ee a fowl in the pot of every pea&s;ant of his kingdom. That &s;entiment of homely benevolence was worth all the &s;plendid &s;ay|ings that are recorded of kings. But he wi&s;hed per|haps for more than could be obtained, and the good|ne&s;s of the man exceeded the power of the king. But this gentleman, a &s;ubject, may this day &s;ay this at lea&s;t, with truth, that he &s;ecures the rice in his pot to every man in India. A poet of antiquity thought it one of the fir&s;t di&s;tinctions to a prince whom he meant to celebrate, that through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of

generations, he had been the progenitor of an able and virtuous citizen, who by force of the arts of peace, had corrected governments of oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed wars of rapine.

<HEAD>GRENVILLE, MR.</HEAD>
<P>UNDOUBTEDLY Mr. Grenville was a fir&s;t-rate figure in this country. With a ma&s;culine under&s;tand|ing, and a &s;tout and re&s;olute heart, he had an appli|cation undi&s;&s;ipated and unwearied. He took public bu&s;ine&s;s, not as a duty which he was to fulfil, but as a plea&s;ure he was to enjoy; and he &s;eemed to have no delight out of this hou&s;e, except in &s;uch things as &s;ome way related to the bu&s;ine&s;s that was to be done within it. If he was ambitious, I will &s;ay this for him, his ambition was of a noble and generous &s;train. It was to rai&s;e him&s;elf, not by the low pimping poli|tics of a court, but to win his way to power, through the laborious gradations of public &s;ervice; and to &s;ecure to him&s;elf a well earned rank in parliament, by a thorough knowledge of its con&s;titution, and a perfect practice in all its bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Sir, if &s;uch a man fell into errors, it mu&s;t be from defects not intrin&s;ical; they mu&s;t be rather &s;ought in the particular habits of his life; which, though they do not alter the ground-work of cha|racter, yet tinge it with their own hue. He was bred in a profe&s;&s;ion. He was bred to the law, which
<PB N="464" REF="290">
is, in my opinion, one of the fir&s;t and noble&s;t of hu|man &s;ciences; a &s;cience which does more to quicken and invigorate the under&s;tanding, than all the other kinds of learning put together; but it is not apt, ex|cept in per&s;ons very happily born, to open and to liberalize the mind exactly in the &s;ame proportion. Pa&s;&s;ing from that &s;tudy he did not go very largely into the world; but plunged into bu&s;ine&s;s; I mean into the bu&s;ine&s;s of office; and the limited and fixed methods and forms e&s;tabli&s;hed there. Much know|ledge is to be had undoubtedly in that line; and there is no knowledge which is not valuable. But it may be truly &s;aid, that men too much conver&s;ant in office, are rarely minds of remarkable enlargement. Their habits of office are apt to give them a turn to think the &s;ub&s;tance of bu&s;ine&s;s not to be much more im|portant than the forms in which it is conducted. The&s;e forms are adapted to ordinary occa&s;ions; and therefore per&s;ons who are nurtured in office do ad|mirably well, as long as things go on in their com|mon order; but when the high roads are broken up, and the waters out, when a new and troubled &s;cene is opened, and the file affords no precedent, then it is that a greater knowledge of mankind, and a far more exten&s;ive comprehen&s;ion of things is re|qui&s;ite than ever office gave, or than office can ever give. Mr. Grenville thought better of the wi&s;dom and power of human legi&s;lation than in truth it de|&s;erves. He conceived, and many conceived along with him, that the flouri&s;hing trade of this country was greatly owing to law and in&s;titution, and not quite &s;o much to liberty; for but too many are apt to believe regulation to be commerce, and taxes to be revenue. Among regulations, that which &s;tood fir&s;t in reputation was his idol. I mean the act of navigation. He has often profe&s;&s;ed it to be &s;o. The policy of that act is, I readily admit, in many re&s;pects well under&s;tood. But I do &s;ay, that if the act be &s;uffered to run the full length of its principle, and
<PB N="465" REF="291">
be not changed and modified according to the change of times and the fluctuation of circum&s;tances, it mu&s;t do great mi&s;chief, and frequently even defeat its own purpo&s;e.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Speech on American Taxation.</HI></BIBL></P>

<P>I EVER looked on Lord Keppel as one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t men of his age; and I loved, and cultivated him accordingly. He was much in my heart, and I believe I was in his to the very la&s;t beat. It was after his trial at Port&s;mouth that he gave me this picture. With what zeal and anxious affection I attended him through that his agony of glory; what part my &s;on in the early &s;lu&s;h and enthu&s;ia&s;m of his virtue, and the pious pa&s;&s;ion with which he attached him&s;elf to all my connections, with what prodigality we both &s;quandered our&s;elves in courting almo&s;t every &s;ort of enmity for his &s;ake, I believe he felt, ju&s;t as I &s;hould have felt, &s;uch friend&s;hip on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. I partook indeed of this honour, with &s;everal of the fir&s;t, and be&s;t, and able&s;t in the king|dom, but I was behind hand with none of them; and I am &s;ure, that if to the eternal di&s;grace of this na|tion, and to the total annihilation of every trace of honour and virtue in it, things had taken a different turn from what they did, I &s;hould have attended him to the quarter-deck with no le&s;s good will and more pride, though with far other feelings, than I partook of the general flow of national joy that at|tended the ju&s;tice that was done to his virtue.</P>
<P>Pardon, my Lord, the feeble garrulity of age, which loves to diffu&s;e it&s;elf in di&s;cour&s;e of the de|parted great. At my years we live in retro&s;pect alone: and, wholly unfitted for the &s;ociety of vigor|ous life, we enjoy, the be&s;t balm to all wounds, the con&s;olation of friend&s;hip, in tho&s;e only whom we have lo&s;t for ever. Feeling the lo&s;s of Lord Kep|pel
<PB N="469" REF="295">
at all times, at no time did I feel it &s;o much as on the fir&s;t day when I was attacked in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P>Had he lived, that reverend form would have ri&s;en in its place, and with a mild, parental repre|hen&s;ion to his nephew the Duke of Bedford, he would have told him that the favour of that gracious prince, who had honoured his virtues with the government of the navy of Great Britain, and with a &s;eat in the hereditary great council of his kingdom, was not unde&s;ervedly &s;hewn to the friend of the be&s;t portion of his life, and his faithful companion and coun&s;ellor under his rude&s;t trials. He would have told him, that to whomever el&s;e the&s;e reproaches might be be|coming, they were not decorous in his near kindred. He would have told them that when men in that rank lo&s;e decorum, they lo&s;e every thing.</P>
<P>On that day I had a lo&s;s in Lord Keppel; but the public lo&s;s of him in this aweful cri&s;is&mdash;! I &s;peak from much knowledge of the per&s;on, he never would have li&s;tened to any compromi&s;e with the rabble rout of this Sans Culotterie of France. His good|ne&s;s of heart, his rea&s;on, his ta&s;te, his public duty, his principles, his prejudices, would have repelled him for ever from all connection with that horrid medley of madne&s;s, vice, impiety, and crime.</P>
<P>Lord Keppel had two countries; one of de&s;cent and one of birth. Their intere&s;ts and their glory are the &s;ame; and his mind was capacious of both. His family was noble, and it was Dutch. That is, he was of the olde&s;t and pure&s;t nobility that Europe can boa&s;t, among a people renowned above all others for love of their native land. Though it was never &s;hewn in in&s;ult to any human being, Lord Kepple was &s;omething high. It was a wild &s;tock of pride, on which the tendere&s;t of all hearts had grafted the milder virtues. He valued ancient nobility; and he was not di&s;inclined to augment it with new honours. He valued the old nobility and the new, not as an
<PB N="470" REF="296">
excu&s;e for inglorious &s;loth, but as an incitement to virtuous activity. He con&s;idered it as a &s;ort of cure for &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and a narrow mind; conceiving that a man born in an elevated place, in him&s;elf was nothing, but every thing in what went before, and what was to come after him. Without much &s;pecu|lation, but by the &s;ure in&s;tinct of ingenuous feelings, and by the dictates of plain un&s;ophi&s;ticated natural under&s;tanding, he felt, that no great Commonwealth could by any po&s;&s;ibility long &s;ub&s;i&s;t, without a body of &s;ome kind or other of nobility, decorated with honour, and fortified by privilege. This nobility forms the chain that connects the ages of a nation, which otherwi&s;e (with Mr. Paine) would &s;oon be taught that no one generation can bind another. He felt that no political fabric could be well made with|out &s;ome &s;uch order of things as might, through a &s;eries of time, afford a rational hope of &s;ecuring unity, coherence, con&s;i&s;tency, and &s;tability to the &s;tate. He felt that nothing el&s;e can protect it again&s;t the levity of courts, and the greater levity of the multitude. That to talk of hereditary monarchy without any thing el&s;e of hereditary reverence in the Commonwealth, was a low-minded ab&s;urdity; fit only for tho&s;e dete&s;table <Q REND="inline">"fools a&s;piring to be knaves,"</Q> who began to forge in 1789, the fal&s;e money of the French Con&s;titution&mdash;That it is one fatal objection to all <HI>new</HI> fancied and <HI>new fabricated</HI> Re|publics (among a people, who, once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch an advantage, have wickedly and in&s;olently rejected it) that the <HI>prejudice</HI> of an old nobility is a thing that <HI>cannot</HI> be made.

<P><PB N="471" REF="297">I knew the man I &s;peak of; and, if we can di|vine the future, out of what we collect from the pa&s;t, no per&s;on living would look with more &s;corn and horror on the impious parricide committed on all their ance&s;try, and on the de&s;perate attainder pa&s;&s;ed on all their po&s;terity, by the Orleans, and the Roche|foucaults, and the Fayettes, and the Vi&s;comtes de Noailles, and the fal&s;e Perigords, and the long <HI>et coetera</HI> of the perfidious Sans Culottes of the court, who like demoniacs, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a &s;pirit of fallen pride, and inverted ambition, abdicated their digni|ties, di&s;owned their families, betrayed the mo&s;t &s;a|cred of all tru&s;ts, and by breaking to pieces a great link of &s;ociety, and all the cramps and holdings of the &s;tate, brought eternal confu&s;ion and de&s;olation on their country.

<P>LOUIS the XVIth was a diligent reader of hi&s;tory. But the very lamp of prudence blinded him. The guide of human life led him a&s;tray. A &s;ilent revo|lution in the moral world preceded the political, and prepared it. It became of more importance than
<PB N="478" REF="304">
ever what examples were given, and what mea&s;ures were adopted. Their cau&s;es no longer lurked in the rece&s;&s;es of cabinets, or in the private con&s;piracies of the factious. They were no longer to be con|trolled by the force and influence of the grandees, who formerly had been able to &s;tir up troubles by their di&s;contents, and to quiet them by their cor|ruption. The chain of &s;ubordination, even in cabal and &s;edition, was broken in its mo&s;t important links. It was no longer the great and the populace. Other intere&s;ts were formed, other dependencies, other con|nexions, other communications. The middle cla&s;s had &s;welled far beyond its former proportions. Like whatever is the mo&s;t effectively rich and great in &s;ociety, that became the &s;eat of all the active poli|tics; and the preponderating weight to decide on them. There were all the energies by which fortune is acquired; there the con&s;equence of their &s;ucce&s;s. There were all the talents which a&s;&s;ert their preten|&s;ions, and are impatient of the place which &s;ettled &s;ociety pre&s;cribes to them. The&s;e de&s;criptions had got between the great and the populace; and the in|fluence on the lower cla&s;&s;es was with them. The &s;pirit of ambition had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this cla&s;s as violently as ever it had done of any other. They felt the importance of this &s;ituation. The corre&s;|pondence of the monied and the mercantile world, the literary intercour&s;e of academies; but, above all, the pre&s;s, of which they had in a manner, entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, made a kind of electric communication every where. The pre&s;s, in reality, has made every government, in its &s;pirit, democratic. Without it the great, the fir&s;t movements could not, perhaps, have been given. But the &s;pirit of ambition, now for the fir&s;t time connected with the &s;pirit of &s;pecu|lation, was not to be re&s;trained at will. There was no longer any means of arre&s;ting a principle in its cour&s;e. When Louis the XVIth, under the influ|ence of the enemies to monarchy, meant to found

but one republic, he &s;et up two. When he meant to take away half the crown of his neighbour, he lo&s;t the whole of his own. Louis the XVIth could not countenance a new republic: yet between that dan|gerous lodgment for an enemy, which he had erected, and his throne, he had the whole Atlantic for a ditch. He had for an outwork the Engli&s;h nation it&s;elf, friendly to liberty, adver&s;e to that mode of it. He was &s;urrounded by a rampart of monarchies, mo&s;t of them allied to him, and generally under his influence. Yet even thus &s;ecured, a republic erected under his au&s;pices, and dependent on his power, became fatal to his throne.

The army which Monk commanded had been formed by Cromwell to a per|fection of di&s;cipline which perhaps has never been exceeded. That army was be&s;ides of an excellent compo&s;ition. The &s;oldiers were men of extraordi|nary piety after their mode, of the greate&s;t regula|rity, and even &s;everity of manners; brave in the field, but mode&s;t, quiet, and orderly, in their quar|ters; men who abhorred the idea of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating their officers or any other per&s;ons; and who (they at lea&s;t who &s;erved in this i&s;land) were firmly attached to tho&s;e generals, by whom they were well treated and ably commanded.

<P>I certainly agree with you, that in all probability we owe our whole con&s;titution to the re&s;toration of the Engli&s;h monarchy.

Cromwell had delivered England from anarchy. His government, though military and de&s;potic, had been regular and orderly. Under the iron, and under the yoke, the &s;oil yielded its produce.

<HEAD>ROUSSEAU.</HEAD>
<P>WE have had the great profe&s;&s;or and founder of <HI>the phylo&s;ophy of vanity</HI> in England. As I had good opportunities of knowing his proceedings almo&s;t from day to day, he left no doubt in my mind, that he entertained no principle either to influence his heart, or to guide his under&s;tanding, but <HI>vanity.</HI> With this vice he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to a degree little &s;hort of madne&s;s. It is from the &s;ame deranged eccentric vanity, that this, the in&s;ane <HI>Socrates</HI> of the National A&s;&s;embly, was impelled to publi&s;h a mad confe&s;&s;ion of his mad faults, and to attempt a new &s;ort of glory, from bringing hardily to light the ob&s;cure and vul|gar vices which we know may &s;ometimes be blended with eminent talents. He has not ob&s;erved on the nature of vanity, who does not know that it is om|nivorous; that it has no choice in its food; that it is fond to talk even of its own faults and vices, as what will excite &s;urprize and draw attention, and what will pa&s;s at wor&s;t for openne&s;s and candour. It was this abu&s;e and perver&s;ion, which vanity makes even of hypocri&s;y, which has driven Rou&s;&s;eau to record a life not &s;o much as chequered, or &s;potted here and there, with virtues, or even di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;ingle good action. It is &s;uch a life he choo&s;es to offer to the attention of mankind. It is &s;uch a life, that with a wild defiance, he &s;lings in the face of his Creator, whom he acknowledges only to brave.
<PB N="487" REF="313">
Your a&s;&s;embly, knowing how much more powerful example is found than precept, has cho&s;en this man (by his own account without a &s;ingle virtue) for a model. To him they erect their fir&s;t &s;tatue. From him they commence their &s;eries of honours and di&s;|tinctions.</P>
<P>It is that new invented virtue which your ma&s;ters canonize, that led their moral hero con&s;tantly to ex|hau&s;t the &s;tores of his powerful rhetoric in the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of univer&s;al benevolence; whil&s;t his heart was incapable of harbouring one &s;park of common parental affection. Benevolence to the whole &s;pecies, and want of feeling for every individual with whom the profe&s;&s;ors come in contact, form the character of the new philo&s;ophy. Setting up for an un&s;ocial in|dependence, this their hero of vanity refu&s;es the ju&s;t price of common labour, as well as the tribute which opulence owes to genius, and which, when paid, honours the giver and the receiver; and then he pleads his beggary as an excu&s;e for his crimes. He melts with tenderne&s;s for tho&s;e only who touch him by the remote&s;t relation, and then, without one natu|ral pang, ca&s;ts away, as a &s;ort of offal and excrement, the &s;pawn of his di&s;gu&s;tful amours, and &s;ends his chil|dren to the ho&s;pital of foundlings. The bear loves, licks, and forms her young; but bears are not philo|&s;ophers. Vanity, however, finds its account in re|ver&s;ing the train of our natural feelings. Thou&s;ands admire the &s;entimental writer; the affectionate father is hardly known in his pari&s;h.</P>
<P>Under this philo&s;ophic in&s;tructor in the <HI>ethics of vanity,</HI> they have attempted in France a regeneration of the moral con&s;titution of man. State&s;men, like your pre&s;ent rulers, exi&s;t by every thing which is &s;purious, fictitious, and fal&s;e; by every thing which takes the man from his hou&s;e, and &s;ets him on a &s;tage, which makes him up an artificial creature, with painted theatric &s;entiments, fit to be &s;een by the glare of candle-light, and formed to be contemplated
<PB N="488" REF="314">
at a due di&s;tance. Vanity is too apt to prevail in all of us, and in all countries. To the improvement of Frenchmen it &s;eems not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be taught upon &s;y&s;tem. But it is plain that the pre&s;ent rebellion was its legitimate offspring, and it is piou&s;ly fed by that rebellion, with a daily dole.</P>
<P>If the &s;y&s;tem of in&s;titution, recommended by the a&s;&s;embly, is fal&s;e and theatric, it is becau&s;e their &s;y&s;tem of government is of the &s;ame character. To that, and to that alone, it is &s;trictly conformable. To under&s;tand either, we mu&s;t connect the morals with the politics of the legi&s;lators. Your practical philo|&s;ophers, &s;y&s;tematic in every thing, have wi&s;ely began at the &s;ource. As the relation between parents and children is the fir&s;t among the elements of vulgar, natural morality, they erect &s;tatues to a wild, fero|cious, low-minded, hard-hearted father, of fine ge|neral feelings; a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred. Your ma&s;ters reject the duties of this vulgar relation, as contrary to liberty; as not founded in the &s;ocial compact; and not binding according to the rights of men; becau&s;e the relation is not, of cour&s;e, the re&s;ult of <HI>free election;</HI> never &s;o on the &s;ide of the children, not always on the part of the parents.</P>
<P>The next relation which they regenerate by their &s;tatues to Rou&s;&s;eau, is that which is next in &s;anctity to that of a father. They differ from tho&s;e old-fa&s;hioned thinkers, who con&s;idered pedagogues as &s;ober and venerable characters, and allied to the pa|rental. The morali&s;ts of the dark times, <HI>preceptorem &s;ancti volu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">re parentis e&s;&s;e loco.</HI> In this age of light, they teach the people, that preceptors ought to be in the place of gallants. They &s;y&s;tematically corrupt a very corruptible race, (for &s;ome time a growing nui&s;ance among&s;t you) a &s;et of pert, petulant, litera|tors, to whom, in&s;tead of their proper, but &s;evere, uno&s;tentatious duties, they a&s;&s;ign the brilliant part of men of wit and plea&s;ure, of gay, young, military
<PB N="489" REF="315">
&s;parks, and danglers at toilets. They call on the ri&s;ing generation in France, to take a &s;ympathy in the adventures and fortunes, and they endeavour to engage their &s;en&s;ibility on the &s;ide of pedagogues, who betray the mo&s;t awful family tru&s;ts, and vitiate their female pupils. They teach the people, that the debauchers of virgins, almo&s;t in the arms of their parents, may be &s;afe inmates in their hou&s;e, and even fit guardians of the honour of tho&s;e hu&s;bands who &s;ucceed legally to the office which the young litera|tors had pre-occupied, without a&s;king leave of law or con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Thus they di&s;po&s;e of all the family relations of parents and children, hu&s;bands and wives. Through this &s;ame in&s;tructor, by whom they corrupt the mo|rals, they corrupt the ta&s;te. Ta&s;te and elegance, though they are reckoned only among the &s;maller and &s;econdary morals, yet are of no mean import|ance in the regulation of life. A moral ta&s;te is not of force to turn vice into virtue; but it recommends virtue with &s;omething like the blandi&s;hments of plea|&s;ure; and it infinitely abates the evils of vice. Rou&s;|&s;eau, a writer of great force and vivacity, is totally de&s;titute of ta&s;te in any &s;en&s;e of the word. Your ma&s;ters, who are his &s;cholars, conceive that all re|finement has an ari&s;tocratic character. The la&s;t age had exhau&s;ted all its powers in giving a grace and noblene&s;s to our natural appetites, and in rai&s;ing them into higher cla&s;s and order than &s;eemed ju&s;tly to belong to them. Through Rou&s;&s;eau, your ma&s;ters are re&s;olved to de&s;troy the&s;e ari&s;tocratic prejudices. The pa&s;&s;ion called love, has &s;o general and powerful an influence; it makes &s;o much of the entertainment, and indeed &s;o much the occupation of that part of life which decides the character for ever, that the mode and the principles on which it engages the &s;ym|pathy, and &s;trikes the imagination, become of the utmo&s;t importance to the morals and manners of every &s;ociety. Your rulers were well aware of this;
<PB N="490" REF="316">
and in their &s;y&s;tem of changing your manners to ac|commodate them to their politics, they found nothing &s;o convenient as Rou&s;&s;eau. Through him they teach men to love after the fa&s;hion of philo&s;ophers; that is, they teach to men, to Frenchmen, a love without gallantry; a love without any thing of that fine flower of youthfulne&s;s and gentility, which places it, if not among the virtues, among the ornaments of life. In|&s;tead of this pa&s;&s;ion, naturally allied to grace and manners, they infu&s;e into their youth an unfa&s;hioned, indelicate, &s;our, gloomy, ferocious medley of pe|dantry and lewdne&s;s; of metaphy&s;ical &s;peculations, blended with the coar&s;e&s;t &s;en&s;uality. Such is the ge|neral morality of the pa&s;&s;ions to be found in their famous philo&s;opher, in his famous work of philo&s;o|phic gallantry, the <HI>Nouvelle Eloi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>When the fence from the gallantry of preceptors is broken down, and your families are no longer protected by decent pride, and &s;alutary dome&s;tic pre|judice, there is but one &s;tep to a frightful corruption. The rulers in the national a&s;&s;embly are in good hopes that the females of the fir&s;t families in France may become an ea&s;y prey to dancing ma&s;ters, fidlers, pattern-drawers, fri&s;eurs, and valets de chambre, and other active citizens of that de&s;cription, who having the entry into your hou&s;es, and being half dome&s;ti|cated by their &s;ituation, may be blended with you by regular and irregular relations. By a law, they have made the&s;e people your equals. By adopting the &s;entiments of Rou&s;&s;eau, they have made them your rivals. In this manner, the&s;e great legi&s;lators complete their plan of levelling, and e&s;tabli&s;h their rights of men on a &s;ure foundation.</P>
<P>I am certain that the writings of Rou&s;&s;eau lead directly to this kind of &s;hameful evil. I have often wondered how he comes to be &s;o much more admired and followed on the continent than he is here. Per|haps a &s;ecret charm in the language may have its &s;hare in this extraordinary difference.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Letter to a Member of the National A&s;&s;embly.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>SAXONY (ELECTOR OF.)</HEAD>
<P>THE pre&s;ent Elector is a Prince of a &s;afe and quiet temper, of great prudence and goodne&s;s. He knows that in the actual &s;tate of things, not the power and re&s;pect belonging to Sovereigns, but their very ex|i&s;tence depends on a rea&s;onable frugality. It is very certain that not one Sovereign in Europe can either promi&s;e for the continuance of his authority in a &s;tate of indigence and in&s;olvency, or dares to venture on a new impo&s;ition to relieve him&s;elf.

from the &s;tate in which the &s;even years war had left Saxony.

<P>The moderation and prudence of the pre&s;ent Elec|tor, in my opinion, rather perhaps re&s;pites the trou|bles than &s;ecures the peace of the Electorate. The offer of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Crown of Poland is truly critical, whether he accepts, or whether he de|clines it.

nor of cour&s;e know what a ferment he was able to excite in every thing by the violent ebullition of his mixed virtues and failings. For failings he had undoubtedly&mdash;many of us remember them; we are this day con&s;idering the effect of them. But he had no failings which were not owing to a noble cau&s;e; to an ardent, generous, perhaps an immode|rate pa&s;&s;ion for fame; a pa&s;&s;ion which is the in&s;tinct of all great &s;ouls. He wor&s;hipped that godde&s;s where&s;oever &s;he appeared; but he paid his particular devotions to her in her favorite habitation, in her cho&s;en temple, the Hou&s;e of Commons. Be&s;ides the characters of the individuals that compo&s;e our body, it is impo&s;&s;ible, Mr. Speaker, not to ob&s;erve, that this Hou&s;e has a collective character of its own. That character, too, however imperfect, is not un|amiable. Like all great public collections of men, you po&s;&s;e&s;s a marked love of virtue, and an abhor|rence of vice. But among vices, there is none, which the Hou&s;e abhors in the &s;ame degree with <HI>ob&s;tinacy.</HI> Ob&s;tinacy, Sir, is certainly a great vice; and in the changeful &s;tate of political affairs it is frequently the cau&s;e of great mi&s;chief. It happens, however, very unfortunately, that almo&s;t the whole line of the great and ma&s;culine virtues, con&s;tancy, gravity, magnanimity, fortitude, fidelity, and firmne&s;s, are clo&s;ely allied to this di&s;agreeable quality, of which you have &s;o ju&s;t an abhorrence; and in their exce&s;s, all the&s;e virtues very ea&s;ily fall into it. He, who paid &s;uch a punctilious attention to all your feelings, certainly took care not to &s;hock them by that vice which is the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tful to you.</P>
<P>That fear of di&s;plea&s;ing tho&s;e who ought mo&s;t to be plea&s;ed, betrayed him &s;ometimes into the other extreme. He had voted, and in the year 1765, had been an advocate for the &s;tamp-act. Things and the di&s;po&s;ition of men's minds were changed. In &s;hort, the &s;tamp-act began to be no favorite in this Hou&s;e. He therefore attended at the private meet|ing,
<PB N="495" REF="321">
in which the re&s;olutions moved by a Right Honourable Gentleman was &s;ettled; re&s;olutions lead|ing to the repeal. The next day he voted for that repeal; and he would have &s;poken for it too, if an illne&s;s (not as was then given out a political) but to my knowledge, a very real illne&s;s, had not prevented it.</P>
<P>The very next &s;e&s;&s;ion, as the fa&s;hion of this world pa&s;&s;eth away, the repeal began to be in as bad an odour in this Hou&s;e as the &s;tamp-act had been in the &s;e&s;&s;ion before. To conform to the temper which began to prevail, and to prevail mo&s;tly among&s;t tho&s;e mo&s;t in power, he declared, very early in the winter, that a revenue mu&s;t be had out of America. In|&s;tantly he was tied down to his engagements by &s;ome, who had no objection to &s;uch experiments, when made at the co&s;t of per&s;ons for whom they had no particular regard. The whole body of courtiers drove him onward. They always talked as if the king &s;tood in a &s;ort of humiliated &s;tate, until &s;ome|thing of the kind &s;hould be done.</P>
<P>Here this extraordinary man, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, found him&s;elf in great &s;traits. To plea&s;e univer&s;ally was the object of his life; but to tax and to plea&s;e, no more than to love and to be wi&s;e, is not given to men. However he attempted it. To render the tax palatable to the partizans of American revenue, he made a preamble, &s;tating the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a revenue. To clo&s;e with the American di&s;tinction, this revenue was <HI>external,</HI> or port duty; but again, to &s;often it to the other party, it was a duty of <HI>&s;upply.</HI> To gratify the <HI>coloni&s;ts,</HI> it was laid on Briti&s;h manufactures; to &s;atisfy the <HI>mer|chants of Britain,</HI> the duty was trivial, and (except that on tea, which touched only the devoted Ea&s;t India company) on none of the grand objects of commerce. To counterwork the American contra|band, the duty on tea was reduced from a &s;hilling to three-pence. But to &s;ecure the favour of tho&s;e
<PB N="496" REF="322">
who would tax America, the &s;cene of collection was changed, and, with the re&s;t, it was levied in the colo|nies. What need I &s;ay more? This fine-&s;pun &s;cheme had the u&s;ual fate of all exqui&s;ite policy. But the original plan of the duties, and the mode of executing that plan, both aro&s;e, &s;ingly and &s;olely, from a love of our applau&s;e. He was truly the child of the Hou&s;e. He never thought, did, or &s;aid any thing but with a view to you. He every day adapted him&s;elf to your di&s;po&s;ition; and adju&s;ted him&s;elf before it, as at a looking-gla&s;s.</P>
<P>He had ob&s;erved (indeed it could not e&s;cape him) that &s;everal per&s;ons, infinitely his inferiors in all re&s;pects, had formerly rendered them&s;elves con&s;ider|able in this Hou&s;e by one method alone. They were a race of men (I hope in God the &s;pecies is extinct) who, when they ro&s;e in their place, no man living could divine, from any known adherence to parties, to opinions, or to principles; from any order or &s;y&s;tem in their politics; or from any &s;equel or connexion in their ideas, what part they were going to take in any debate. It is a&s;toni&s;hing how much this uncertainty, e&s;pecially at critical times, called the attention of all parties on &s;uch men. All eyes were fixed on them, all ears open to hear them; each party gaped, and looked alternately for their vote, almo&s;t to the end of their &s;peeches. While the Hou&s;e hung in this uncertainty, now the <HI>hear-hims</HI> ro&s;e from this &s;ide&mdash;now they rebellowed from the other; and that party to whom they fell at length from their tremulous and dancing balance, always received them in a tempe&s;t of applau&s;e.

His adver&s;aries had the better of the argu|ment, as he handled it, not as the rea&s;on and ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e enabled him to manage it.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Regicide Peace.</HI></BIBL></P>

<P>ATTEND, I pray you, to the &s;ituation and pro&s;|perity of Benfield, Ha&s;tings, and others of that &s;ort. The la&s;t of the&s;e has been treated by the Company with an a&s;perity of reprehen&s;ion that has no parallel. They lament,

Yet for fourteen years, with little inter|ruption, he has governed all their affairs, of every de&s;cription, with an ab&s;olute &s;way. He has had him&s;elf the means of heaping up immen&s;e wealth; and, during that whole period, the fortunes of hun|dreds have depended on his &s;miles and frowns. He him&s;elf tells you he is incumbered with two hundred and fifty young gentlemen, &s;ome of them of the be&s;t families in England, all of whom aim at returning with va&s;t fortunes to Europe in the prime of life. He has then two hundred and fifty of your children as his ho&s;tages for your good behaviour; and loaded for years, as he has been, with the execrations of the natives, with the cen&s;ures of the Court of Direc|tors, and &s;truck and bla&s;ted with re&s;olutions of this Hou&s;e, he &s;till maintains the mo&s;t de&s;potic power ever known in India. He domineers with an over|bearing &s;way in the a&s;&s;emblies of his pretended ma&s;|ters; and it is thought in a degree ra&s;h to venture to name his offences in this Hou&s;e, even as grounds of a legi&s;lative remedy.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Speech on Mr. Fox's Ea&s;t-India Bill.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>WILKES, (JOHN) ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL not believe, what no other man living believes, that Mr. Wilkes was puni&s;hed for the inde|cency of his publications, or the impiety of his ran|&s;acked clo&s;et. If he had fallen in a common &s;laughter of libellers and bla&s;phemers, I could well believe that nothing more was meant than was pre|tended. But when I &s;ee that, for years together, full as impious, and perhaps more dangerous writings to religion, and virtue, and order, have not been pu|ni&s;hed, nor their authors di&s;countenanced; that the mo&s;t audacious libels on royal maje&s;ty have pa&s;&s;ed without notice; that the mo&s;t trea&s;onable invectives again&s;t the laws, liberties, and con&s;titution of the country, have not met with the &s;lighte&s;t animadver|&s;ion;
<PB N="499" REF="325">
I mu&s;t con&s;ider this as a &s;hocking and &s;hamele&s;s pretence. Never did an envenomed &s;currility again&s;t every thing &s;acred and civil, public and private, rage through the kingdom with &s;uch a furious and un|bridled licence. All this while the peace of the na|tion mu&s;t be &s;haken, to ruin one libeller, and to tear from the populace a &s;ingle favourite.</P>
<P>Nor is it that vice merely &s;kulks in an ob&s;cure and contemptible impunity. Does not the public behold with indignation, per&s;ons not only generally &s;candal|ous in their lives, but the identical per&s;ons who, by their &s;ociety, their in&s;truction, their example, their encouragement, have drawn this man into the very faults which have furni&s;hed the cabal with a pretence for his per&s;ecution, loaded with every kind of favour, honour, and di&s;tinction, which a court can be&s;tow? Add but the crime of &s;ervility (the <HI>foedum crimen &s;er|vitutis</HI>) to every other crime, and the whole ma&s;s is immediately tran&s;muted into virtue, and becomes the ju&s;t &s;ubject of reward and honour. When therefore I reflect upon this method pur&s;ued by the cabal in di&s;tributing rewards and puni&s;hments, I mu&s;t con|clude that Mr. Wilkes is the object of per&s;ecution, not on account of what he has done in common with others who are the objects of reward, but for that in which he differs from many of them: that he is pur|&s;ued for the &s;pirited di&s;po&s;itions which are blended with his vices; for his unconquerable firmne&s;s, for his re&s;olute, indefatigable, &s;trenuous re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;<HI>Thoughts on the Cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent Di&s;|contents.</HI></P>
