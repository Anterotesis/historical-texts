<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THO' &s;uch <HI>ESSAYS,</HI> as com|po&s;e the following <HI>Volumes,</HI> are in <HI>Univer&s;al E&s;teem,</HI> and liable to every
One's <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> yet it has not been my Fortune to meet with any <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> written purpo&s;ely upon the <HI>Nature</HI> of them.
The <HI>ESSAYISTS</HI> are apt to beat the <HI>Imagi|nation</HI> in Search of <HI>&s;trange</HI> and <HI>exotick Sub|jects</HI> to write upon, while a <HI>Di&s;qui&s;ition</HI> into their own <HI>Works,</HI> which are capable of
afford|ing <HI>Matter</HI> &s;o ample, &s;eems to be intirely over|looked by <HI>Them.</HI> In this re&s;embling the human <HI>Mind,</HI> which while it
enters into, and examines the <HI>Depth</HI> of all other <HI>Sciences,</HI>
&s;eems to con&s;ider nothing le&s;s than its own <HI>Motions.</HI></P>
<P>MOST other Kinds of <HI>Writing</HI> have, I think, been the <HI>Objects</HI> of <HI>Critici&s;m,</HI> and <PB N="ii" REF="3"> <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> have been laid down for the <HI>Writers</HI>
of them to <HI>Ob&s;erve;</HI> but in this <HI>Spe|cies,</HI> nobody is
confin'd; The only <HI>Rule</HI> that I know, (and it is generally well
ob&s;erved) is not only to go without, but to go again&s;t all <HI>Order</HI>
and <HI>Method</HI> what&s;oever. <HI>Montaigne,</HI> if I mi&s;take not, was
the <HI>Inventor</HI> of it; and <HI>He</HI> is in all its <HI>Beauties</HI>
and <HI>Faults</HI> the be&s;t <HI>Pat|tern</HI> to examine it by. <HI>He</HI>
has a great deal of <HI>Wit,</HI> much good <HI>Ob&s;ervation,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Learn|ing;</HI> but his <HI>ESSAYS</HI> are wild, rambling, and incoherent;
&s;ome of them don't treat at all of the <HI>Subjects</HI> propos'd, and others
might as well have any other Title as tho&s;e they wear: They are, in effect,
like Mr. <HI>Bays</HI>'s <HI>Prologue,</HI> that would do either as <HI>Prologue</HI> or <HI>Epilogue,</HI> or &s;erve indifferently for any other <HI>Play,</HI> as well as that which it was written for.</P>
<P>THO' there are to be found among the <HI>An|tients</HI> &s;ome
little <HI>Tracts</HI> upon particular <HI>Subjects,</HI> which if they were
written at this <HI>Time,</HI> would be called <HI>ESSAYS;</HI> yet as they
were generally (if we except the <HI>Sympo&s;iacks</HI> of <HI>Plutarch</HI>)
made by <HI>Receipts,</HI> and done with a View to the <HI>Rules,</HI> which <HI>Orators</HI> and <HI>Declai|mers</HI> laid down for &s;uch <HI>Compo&s;itions;</HI> the Honour of this <HI>Invention</HI> mu&s;t &s;till
be a&s;cribed to <HI>Montaigne,</HI> who fir&s;t introduced that u&s;eful <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Digre&s;&s;ion</HI> into <HI>Treati&s;es</HI> upon
&s;elect <HI>Subjects;</HI> and by giving us every whim&s;ical <HI>Con|ceit</HI> that came into his Head, has led us as it were dancing after
his <HI>Morality,</HI> much more plea&s;antly <PB N="iii" REF="4"> than if we
walked in the Stilts, or were di|rected by the Leading-Strings which <HI>Seneca</HI> had accu&s;tomed us to. <HI>Montaigne</HI> had a great many
Followers in <HI>France,</HI> and &s;ome in this Country: But the be&s;t, and
he that excelled his <HI>Original,</HI> was <HI>La Bruyere;</HI> the fine&s;t
and mo&s;t delicate <HI>Remarks,</HI> the &s;tronge&s;t <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> and
the ju&s;te&s;t <HI>Rea&s;oning,</HI> all embelli&s;hed by an Elegance of <HI>Style,</HI> and a Felicity of <HI>Expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> are to be found in
his <HI>Works;</HI> to which we mu&s;t add, that the frequent <HI>Egoti&s;ms;</HI> the needle&s;s <HI>Quo|tations,</HI> the whim&s;ical <HI>Di&s;play</HI> of the Author's <HI>Character</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> at
every Period, and other Impertinences which pa&s;s upon &s;ome for <HI>Humour,</HI> are not to be met with in him. He has all the <HI>Variety,</HI> and an Appearance of the <HI>Irregularity</HI> which
plea&s;es, but intirely dive&s;ted of the <HI>Digre&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Di&s;traction</HI> which con&s;ound and di&s;gu&s;t the <HI>READER</HI> in
the&s;e Performan|ces. In &s;hort, reading <HI>Montaigne,</HI> is Hunt|ing in a
Country where you &s;tart &s;o much <HI>Game</HI> as to &s;poil your <HI>Sport;</HI> while <HI>La Bruyere</HI> gives you all the <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI>
and <HI>Variety</HI> of the <HI>Chace,</HI> without the Fatigue of following
the <HI>Prey</HI> too far.</P>
<P>WITHOUT arraigning the <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> of others, I will venture
to &s;ay, That very little in this Way, worth <HI>Ob&s;ervation,</HI> has
appeared at Home till the <HI>TATLER</HI> began to retail his Pennyworths of <HI>WIT.</HI> Several <HI>Political Tracts,</HI> it is true, have come forth,
and &s;ome <HI>Argumentative Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> which had their 
<PB N="iv" REF="5"> Shares of <HI>Merit;</HI> but did not come properly within
this Species of <HI>Writing.</HI> The Character of <HI>BICKERSTAFFE,</HI> had
it been real, was more upon the <HI>Humouri&s;t</HI> and <HI>Whim&s;ical</HI>
than that of <HI>Montaigne;</HI> and I believe the Fiction which was &s;een in
it, by being natural, heighten'd the Plea&s;ure which it gave us; be&s;ides,
the Limits of his Paper prevented his being &s;o diffu&s;e and prolix, as we
often find the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who for want of &s;uch a Confinement,
&s;ometimes di&s;|gu&s;ts us. The <HI>SPECTATOR,</HI> and <HI>NESTOR
IRONSIDE,</HI> are <HI>Characters</HI> al&s;o excellently well adapted to the
Creation of our <HI>Plea&s;ures,</HI> by our <HI>Knowledge</HI> of their being
Fictitious: For &s;uch is our Malignity of <HI>Temper,</HI> that we can't
forgive a real <HI>Author</HI> acting or thinking oddly or idly, though our <HI>Entertainment</HI> ari&s;es from thence, becau&s;e we con&s;ider him as a
rea|&s;onable Man, and obliged by a &s;uperior <HI>Duty</HI> to another kind of <HI>Behaviour;</HI> but we can in|dulge an imaginary, or a&s;&s;umed
Per&s;onage in any ludicrous, frolick&s;ome or whim&s;ical <HI>Words</HI> or <HI>Opinions,</HI> becau&s;e we know that he only plays the <HI>Fool</HI> for
our <HI>Delight</HI> and <HI>Amu&s;ement,</HI> which we grudge him to do for
his own. Thus <HI>Montaigne</HI>'s Faults are the Beauties of <HI>BICKERSTAFFE</HI> and <HI>IRONSIDE;</HI> and thus <HI>Cibber</HI> and <HI>Hippe&s;ly</HI> are applauded on the <HI>Stage,</HI> for what they would in
private <HI>Life</HI> run the Ha|zard of <HI>Correction.</HI></P>
<P>CERTAINLY, writing under an a&s;&s;ump|tive <HI>Character</HI> is
a fine Improvement in this <PB N="v" REF="6"> <HI>Way;</HI> and I believe the <HI>Novelty</HI> of it, without derogating from the <HI>Wit, Humour,</HI> good <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> or excellent <HI>Style</HI> of tho&s;e mentioned <HI>Papers,</HI> made up the greate&s;t Part of their <HI>Merit:</HI> The
little Incidents of human <HI>Life,</HI> Pieces of <HI>Conver&s;ation,</HI> and
familiar <HI>Arguments,</HI> which may be thrown into <HI>Writing</HI> under
&s;uch a <HI>Cha|racter,</HI> give it the <HI>Advantage</HI> of all other <HI>Me|thods</HI>: And I am of <HI>Opinion</HI> it mu&s;t eternally <HI>Plea&s;e</HI> (and the Succe&s;s of the following <HI>Papers,</HI> when
fir&s;t publi&s;h'd, corroborates the Opinion) if as new <HI>Matter</HI> is
continually ri&s;ing, &s;ome <HI>Geni|us's</HI> could be found able to treat it
in a Manner equal to their <HI>Predece&s;&s;ors.</HI> Tho' perhaps, <HI>The
Stamp Act</HI> fir&s;t, and then the Ri&s;e and Multi|plication of <HI>Weekly
Journals,</HI> are now &s;uch Im|pediments to a fair Hearing in this <HI>Method,</HI> as almo&s;t amount to a <HI>Prohibition</HI> of &s;uch <HI>ESSAYS</HI> for the future.</P>
<P>THE Invention of <HI>Weekly Journals,</HI> was, I believe owing to
the <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> which the Town be|gan to entertain from the Writings of
the <HI>TATLER, SPECTATOR,</HI> and others. Small <HI>ESSAYS</HI> were &s;o
much liked, that it was imagined worth while to put a little <HI>Wit,</HI> and
a great deal of <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> in a large Quantity of Pa|per, and &s;ell it
for the &s;ame or a le&s;s Price than <HI>The Stamp Duty</HI> had rais'd the
half Sheet <HI>Treati&s;e</HI> to. The <HI>Project</HI> &s;ucceeded, and we
have had &s;everal excellent <HI>Things</HI> publi&s;h'd in that <HI>Way;</HI>
&s;ome that in their <HI>Fame</HI> almo&s;t rivall'd any <HI>Thing</HI> that
went before them, but <PB N="vi" REF="7"> by the Nature of their <HI>Subjects,</HI> ought to be excluded from this <HI>Cla&s;s</HI> of <HI>Writing;</HI> which whatever Liberties Men take, ought never to be drawn
into Controver&s;ies about <HI>Religion</HI> or <HI>Government,</HI> Things
that, to be &s;ure, require a more orderly and regular manner of Treating, than
is con&s;i&s;tent with the Freedom and Latitude of an <HI>ESSAY.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, as I hinted before, we have almo&s;t lo&s;t the Advantage of <HI>Entertaining</HI> in any other <HI>Manner;</HI> the <HI>Journals</HI> come
abroad &s;o &s;eldom, that if a <HI>Humour</HI> was begun, Men would for|get it
before it could be pro&s;ecuted, and the <HI>Je&s;t</HI> would be lo&s;t before
it was found. The general Way now of communicating our <HI>Thoughts</HI> to the
Publick, is, by di&s;tinct and unconnected <HI>Letters</HI> to the <HI>Author</HI> of this or that <HI>Journal,</HI> and the common a&s;&s;umed <HI>Characters</HI> are, a <HI>Phi|lo&s;opher,</HI> a <HI>Critick,</HI> or a <HI>Divine;</HI> in the&s;e, &s;ome important <HI>Point</HI> is con&s;tantly
laid down, and as gravely and &s;olemnly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Thus we intrude upon
the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> and &s;eem not to think that to mend the <HI>Heart</HI> it
is nece&s;&s;ary to plea&s;e the <HI>Imagination.</HI></P>
<P>THIS certainly is mi&s;&s;ing the <HI>Mark,</HI> and the&s;e
little <HI>ESSAYS</HI> are written in the true&s;t <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> when they
cloath good <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> with <HI>Humour,</HI> and embelli&s;h good <HI>Morals</HI> with <HI>Wit;</HI> when they in&s;truct <HI>Familiarly,</HI>
and reprove <HI>Plea&s;antly;</HI> when they don't &s;well above <HI>Com|prehen&s;ion,</HI> nor &s;ink below <HI>Delicacy:</HI> In &s;hort, 
<PB N="vii" REF="8"> when they adapt the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of the <HI>Antients</HI> to the <HI>Gu&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Moderns,</HI> and
con&s;train <HI>Montaigne</HI>'s Plea&s;antry within <HI>BICKERSTAFFE</HI>'s
Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>I CAN'T conclude without mentioning two Objections, which
among&s;t others, the&s;e Sort of <HI>Writings,</HI> and their <HI>Authors,</HI> are liable to, the fir&s;t is, That as from the <HI>Nature</HI> of their Subjects, it is often nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be <HI>Occa&s;ional,</HI> which requires <HI>Di&s;patch,</HI> and pre|vents that <HI>Accuracy,</HI> which much <HI>Lei&s;ure,</HI> and frequent <HI>Reviews,</HI> generally produce in other <HI>Works,</HI> that in &s;uch
Ca&s;es, to sketch out, or de&s;ign well, is as much as can be performed, which
certainly can give the <HI>Mind</HI> but a half <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> and &s;o
far the <HI>Work</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be <HI>Imperfect.</HI></P>
<P>THE Second is to be found in <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI>'s
Di&s;coveries, which therefore take in his own Words.</P>
<Q>SOME that turn over all Books, and are equally &s;earching in all
Papers, that write out of what they pre&s;ently find or meet without Choice; by
which means it happens that what they have di&s;credited and impug|ned in one
Work, they have before or after extolled the &s;ame in another. Such are all
the <HI>E&s;&s;ayi&s;ts,</HI> even their Ma&s;ter <HI>Montaigne.</HI> The&s;e
in all they write, confe&s;s &s;till what Books they have read la&s;t; and
therein their <PB N="viii" REF="9"> own Folly, &s;o much, that they bring it to
the Stake <HI>raw</HI> and <HI>undige&s;ted:</HI> Not that the Place did need
it neither, but that they thought them&s;elves furni&s;hed, and would vent
it.</Q>
<P>THESE <HI>Objections</HI> had not been mention|ed, but that we
believe the following <HI>Pieces</HI> &s;tand clear of them; the Reception
which was at fir&s;t given them, encourages us in that <HI>Thought,</HI> and it
is hoped, That from a Peru|&s;al of them, the candid <HI>READER</HI> will
enter|tain the &s;ame <HI>Opinion.</HI></P>

<P>_WHEN a <HI>Stranger</HI> comes into Com|pany, the Whi&s;per goes
round, <HI>Who is He?</HI> and the Face each Man wears, is the Effect of his
In|formation: You ought therefore, to know, who I <HI>am,</HI> that you may
regard what I <HI>&s;ay</HI>; and then, it is to be hop'd, we &s;hall
conver&s;e without Jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>I AM a talkative <HI>Old Batchelor,</HI> in my grand Climacterick,
of a &s;anguine Complexion; well-limb'd, &s;trong and hearty; in Stature more
than middling; my Face is round and &s;mooth, <PB N="2" REF="11"> my Forehead
high and open, my Eye-brows are widely arch'd, my Teeth &s;ound, and white; I
have a No&s;e a little <HI>Aquiline,</HI> Eyes black and &s;pritely; my Hair is
brown and &s;hort, but &s;omewhat of the thinne&s;t, with a Silver|ing of Grey
among it: I wear my Cloaths plain, am a great Lover of Walking, and go commonly
alone; I carry a pair of Mou&s;e-colour'd Gloves in one Hand, and my Oaken
Stick in the other, in&s;tead of a Cane; for I am naturally partial to the
Manufactures of my Country, and an irreconcileable Enemy to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Company.</HI></P>
<P>MY Father, who was one of the <HI>Cavaliers</HI> of the la&s;t
Century, had a <HI>Da&s;h</HI> in his <HI>Temper,</HI> of what his
Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es called <HI>Surly</HI>; but he was of frank Heart and &s;imple
Manners. There was an unlucky kind of Contra&s;t in his Di&s;|po&s;ition, for
he was Amorous, but Unpoli&s;h'd: He &s;eems to have been rather Serious, than
Witty; yet he lov'd Wit in others, and was particularly charm'd with the
Wantonne&s;s of Mrs. <HI>Behn.</HI> That arch Baggage has made bold, in her
Comedy, called the <HI>Rover,</HI> both with his Name, and his
Character.&mdash;Who|ever has &s;een <HI>Ned Blunt,</HI> has &s;een, not the <HI>Copy,</HI> but the very <HI>Life</HI> of my Father.</P>
<P>HE left me an E&s;tate, rather moderate than plentiful; which I
have neither improv'd, nor dimini&s;h'd. I was naturally di&s;pos'd to Quiet,
and affected to think calmly: For this <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> I have ob&s;tinately
re&s;i&s;ted MARRIAGE. I pa&s;s my Summers at <HI>Blunt-Hall,</HI> the ancient 
<PB N="3" REF="12"> Seat of our Family, in the dirtie&s;t Part of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex:</HI> My Winters I enjoy in Town, where I am the olde&s;t Member
now alive of an A&s;&s;em|bly, of both Sexes, very numerous and diver|&s;ified:
We meet, twice a Week, at the Hou&s;e of a &s;ober Widow, whom we placed there
on Purpo&s;e. But, becau&s;e I delight in Study, and am an Enemy to the Faction
and Flutter of the Polite End of the Town, I have my Lodgings in a low-built,
&s;ilent Hou&s;e in the City, which has a large, &s;hady Garden, and covers the
very <HI>Spot,</HI> where, of old, as <HI>Stow</HI> tells me, &s;tood the
Watch-Tower of <HI>Barbican.</HI></P>
<P>IT has always been my Cu&s;tom, To keep a daily Account, in
Writing, of my Actions and Ob&s;ervations, even to Particulars of no &s;eem|ing
Importance. By Help of the&s;e Notes, I live over again my pa&s;t Time, and
learn Wi&s;|dom from my Follies.&mdash;I have lately been reflecting, and taken
it &s;tongly into my Fancy, That, wanting Children of my own, I &s;hould be
Every Body's Father: I have &s;o many Things to &s;ay, and am &s;o naturally
fond of <HI>Teaching,</HI> that I promi&s;e my &s;elf no &s;mall <HI>Fame,</HI>
from the Succe&s;s of my Weekly Coun|&s;el: The SUBJECT of my PAPER gave me
little or no Pain: My Propen&s;ity to Talking required, That it &s;hould be <HI>General,</HI> and <HI>Un|boundedly Copious</HI>; But the NAME was a <HI>Dif|ficulty,</HI> that I could not ea&s;ily get over: That <HI>Large</HI>
Part of Mankind, which con&s;i&s;ts of SUPERFICIALISTS, judging every Thing by
Ap|pearance, <HI>ta&s;te</HI> but coldly of a Meaning which <PB N="4" REF="13">
is not <HI>dre&s;s'd</HI> to their <HI>Reli&s;h</HI>; and the <HI>Will,</HI>
that is too &s;tubborn to bend to the <HI>Fancy,</HI> &s;hall hard|ly be able
to work upon the <HI>Under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Doubt was &s;o knotty, that I &s;ub|mitted it to the <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> where a learned <HI>Clergyman</HI> &s;poke fir&s;t, and
was for calling it the INQUISITOR; He was hone&s;tly proceed|ing to give his <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> for that Name, but was &s;martly interrupted by an <HI>Alderman</HI>'s Wife, who, with Eyes full of Fire, and Face as red as her
Ribbands, told him, <HI>That, however the</HI> Inqui&s;ition <HI>might agree
with</HI> His <HI>Principles, it would never go down with</HI> hone&s;t <HI>People and</HI> Prote&s;tants:&mdash;<HI>If you de&s;ire,</HI> (&s;aid
&s;he to me) <HI>That your</HI> PAPER <HI>&s;hould be read by the</HI> Friends <HI>of the</HI> Government, <HI>you &s;hould give it a</HI> &s;ober <HI>Name,
and call it the</HI> TRUTH-TELLER.</P>
<P>A pert <HI>Coquet,</HI> who &s;ate next her, a Toa&s;t, and a
great Fortune, bur&s;t into a loud Laugh; <HI>Oh! Heavens!</HI> cry'd the
Gip&s;ey, <HI>I &s;hall faint at the odious Formality of that</HI> Title! <HI>Ah, Ma|dam! How could you be &s;o unrea&s;onably mi&s;taken! The</HI>
TRUTH-TELLER!&mdash;<HI>Lord, deliver us! why, the</HI> COURT <HI>can never
bear it! and all the</HI> gay World <HI>will de&s;pi&s;e and abhor
it!&mdash;No, no, if you wi&s;h your</HI> PAPER <HI>to</HI> Spread <HI>and
grow</HI> Publick, <HI>you have nothing to re&s;olve, but to call it the</HI>
SECRET.</P>
<P><HI>FOR my Part,</HI> an&s;wered a grave Virgin, about Fifty, <HI>I think they would do well to entitle it the</HI> COQUET; <HI>There's
&s;carce a Fop in Town but would be fond of that Name; for he would con&s;ider

Chair, and broke out, on a &s;udden, with an Air of Amazement; <HI>Hey Day! if
you mu&s;t</HI> whip <HI>it about thus, and keep it con&s;tantly &s;pin|ning,
the be&s;t Thing you can do is, To call it the</HI> WHIRLIGIG. All the Company

<P>I was un&s;atisfied with All This; and having a natural Partiality

<P>THE <HI>LADIES,</HI> when they hear, That my De&s;ign is PLAIN

nothing to do with Them; yet I know they will be frequently kind enough to
furni&s;h me with Bu&s;ine&s;s, and I &s;hall handle them, as often as they
allow me Opportunity.&mdash;The CHURCH and the STATE I have no great Genius for
meddling with; They are either <HI>well</HI> as they <HI>are,</HI> or will
never be the <HI>better</HI> for any Thing I can <HI>&s;ay</HI> to them. But

<P>THREE Enormous Abu&s;es, have grown of late Years to a
&s;candalous Heighth among us, <HI>Ma&s;querading, Gaming,</HI> and <HI>Stock-Jobbing.</HI> They are Enemies to the Civil So|ciety of Mankind, and
De&s;troyers of that va|luable Doctrine of PLAIN DEALING which I would &s;o
earne&s;tly recommend.</P>
<P><HI>MASQUERADES</HI> are the Undoers of Beau|ty, Honour, and
Innocence, and, methinks it &s;hould be enough to deter any young <HI>Lady,</HI> if &s;he did but reflect upon this Great Truth, That her
Ma&s;que, has, at be&s;t, thrown a Cloud upon her Reputation, that will hang
heavy for a long Time after, and &s;ink her in the E&s;teem of her former
Admirers.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>Gaming,</HI> the Sons of our Nobility, and the Heirs to
plentiful E&s;tates, e&s;pecial|ly tho&s;e who become too early their own
Ma&s;ters, are the Victims of Sharpers, the Prey of tho&s;e Man-hunters, who
form A&s;&s;o|ciations <PB N="8" REF="17"> to over-turn as many Hone&s;t
So|cieties as they can; and only live in Peace to|gether, by being united in a
Confederacy to &s;pread De&s;olation among others. The Heads of our be&s;t
Families may not improperly be called the GAME of this wide-wa&s;ting
Fra|ternity.</P>
<P><HI>STOCK-JOBBING</HI> is the Overthrow of all regular Commerce,
and involves many a rich Trader, in the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>THESE Three Grand Enormities &s;tand in direct Oppo&s;ition to
PLAIN DEALING; and the Province which I have undertaken, demands of me to
declare War again&s;t them, and exert my be&s;t Endeavours to remove them out
of the Way as fa&s;t as I am able. They grow out of the Obliquity of a Mind,
that meditates an unnatural Increa&s;e of its own Ea&s;e, by di|mini&s;hing the
Satisfaction of other People, and filling them with Unea&s;ine&s;s and
Di&s;quiet. The&s;e Subjects are &s;o fruitful, that I &s;hall im|ploy this
whole Paper upon the <HI>Ma&s;querades</HI> alone, and defer the Correction of
the other to a &s;econd Opportunity.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Count</HI> of the <HI>ill-favour'd Vi&s;age</HI> may may
be con&s;idered as the Leader and Captain-General of the&s;e Forces; and
therefore, if in entring into a &s;ingle Combat with him, I am valiant enough
to get the better, I doubt not but the Army under his Command will pull off
their Ma&s;ques, in Re&s;pect to my Victory, and not be a&s;hamed to &s;hew
their Faces, when they appear on the &s;ide that is uppermo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="18">THEY who lay <HI>Ma&s;ques</HI> to the <HI>Count</HI>'s Charge, have accounted for it very plea&s;antly, and will have
it to be a politick Undertaking. He ought, &s;ay they, by the Laws of Sympathy
to have Regard to a Vizor, &s;ince his <HI>natural</HI> Countenance bears
&s;uch Re&s;emblance to tho&s;e <HI>artificial</HI> ones, that the only means
in his Power to look like a <HI>Man,</HI> was to teach every Man to look like a <HI>Mon&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I am not in a Humour to content my &s;elf with &s;uch
ab&s;tracted Speculations, which appear to me to be artfully framed on
purpo&s;e to <HI>excu&s;e</HI> a Man they pretend to find fault with. It is
true, they make a Je&s;t of the Per&s;on, but they throw a <HI>Ma&s;que</HI>
over the Mind, which ought certainly to be mo&s;t cha|&s;ti&s;ed. I dare
&s;wear for the <HI>Count,</HI> it is not his nature to be angry with any Body,
that, by handling his <HI>Face</HI> a little <HI>freely,</HI> gives him a <HI>hand&s;ome</HI> Opportunity for handling the <HI>Pockets</HI> of other
People. <HI>Greater</HI> State&s;men than <HI>He,</HI> have been contented to
look <HI>&s;illy</HI> for a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> End, and to become the Je&s;ts of
the People, when they have been &s;ure of an <HI>Equi|valent.</HI> This makes
me afraid that the&s;e Waggs, who &s;peak of him with &s;o much &s;eeming
Smartne&s;s, are his Friends at the bot|tom, and I doubt, if the Truth were
known, he has bribed them to be of his Party by let|ting them now and then,
into the <HI>Secrets</HI> of <HI>Ma&s;querading.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST therefore take leave to look a little &s;eriou&s;ly into
this Matter, and I am afraid we <PB N="10" REF="19"> &s;hall find, That the <HI>Count</HI> has not &s;o much a De&s;ign to make Per&s;ons of Quality with
their Ma&s;ques on, look like the <HI>Count,</HI> as to make the <HI>Count</HI>
look like Per&s;ons of Quality with their Ma&s;ques off.</P>
<P>SEVERAL Clergymen, &s;ome Bi&s;hops, and other grave Per&s;onages,
have thought this a Matter of <HI>Importance</HI> enough to take Notice of as
well as I; but &s;till, it &s;eems, the <HI>Count</HI> is &s;ecretly re&s;olved
to have Wit enough to take no notice of any of us. It mu&s;t be allowed indeed,
That he is a Per&s;on of uncommon Parts, to &s;tand Proof again&s;t the
Rea&s;oning of &s;o many Learned, and Great Men, without be|ing in the lea&s;t
convinced or per&s;waded.</P>
<P>BUT, tho' this Power, of re&s;i&s;ting the Force of &s;o many
Eloquent Rea&s;oners, proves him a Prodigy in <HI>Genius,</HI> and
demon&s;trates him to have a world of Wit, yet I would not have him forget,
that there is <HI>&s;ome</HI> Merit al&s;o, in <HI>Mo|de&s;ty.</HI> If a
Clergyman or a Bi&s;hop, give their Opinions again&s;t him, he thinks it
&s;ufficient to &s;hrug his Shoulders, and &s;ay, grinning in his own Defence,
That he wonders they &s;hould make &s;uch a Bu&s;tle, <HI>for that a Domine, a
Ca&s;&s;ock, and a Mitre, are the mo&s;t common Ma&s;ques in Fa&s;hion.</HI>
This rai&s;es a loud Laugh, and he comes off cleverly among the <HI>young
Fel|lows;</HI> but he mu&s;t not imagine to e&s;cape &s;o with Per&s;ons of <HI>my</HI> Gravity.</P>
<P>SEVERAL old Coun&s;ellors of State, and at Law, grave
Phy&s;icians, ancient Citizens, and worthy Country Gentlemen, ju&s;t come up
with <PB N="11" REF="20"> their Wives and Daughters, to pay a Vi&s;it to the
Town, have all complained of him in their Turns, and met with no better
Quarter, and notwith&s;tanding all they can &s;ay to the contrary, he has
continued to carry on his Shew with very &s;ucce&s;sful Raillery: I expect that
he will give <HI>me</HI> my Share of his Taunts among the re&s;t; but I have as
little Ta&s;te for his <HI>Wit,</HI> as I have for his <HI>Sweetmeats</HI>; and
to deal plainly with him, I am in no &s;uch merry Vein, as he may think, when I
tell him this unwelcome Truth, That the Effects of <HI>Ma&s;|querades,</HI> are
very &s;erious Things to Husbands, and Fathers, tho' they are Jokes to him and
to <HI>&s;ome,</HI> who are pleas'd to &s;upport him. I mu&s;t, therefore,
de&s;ire him to lay a&s;ide his <HI>Wit,</HI> and con&s;ider, with a little <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> whether He may not be in Danger of falling hereafter in|to
the Clutches of a certain dark Enemy, who is now his Friend in <HI>Ma&s;querade,</HI> and who will not be &s;o ea&s;ily eluded.</P>
<P>HE may recollect, if he plea&s;es, in one of the <HI>Ma&s;querades,</HI> a &s;trange Spectacle, like a Man, whom he took, at
fir&s;t, to have a Vizard on, but found upon a more narrow Exami|nation to have
exactly the Lineaments of his own Face, the &s;ame Shape, the &s;ame Air, the
&s;ame Gait, the &s;ame Cloaths, as him&s;elf, and his very Wig of the &s;ame
Colour, and hang|ing with the Fore-top on one Tip of the Ear, ju&s;t like his
own: He may remember, that this gha&s;tly Mimick, con&s;tantly attended him,
that whole Night, did every thing that he did; <PB N="12" REF="21"> &s;aid
every thing he &s;aid; and went to every Place where he went: He may remember,
that he was &s;truck with a terrible Panick, and did not know what to think of
this uninvited Companion of his, but took him, &s;ometimes, for a meer Mimick;
&s;ometimes for a Spectre, but at la&s;t he was convinced, that it cou'd be no
other, than the <HI>Devil,</HI> which a great many <HI>well-meaning</HI> People
believ'd was certainly the Truth: and he very well knows, that he, and his
Companion, were ea&s;ily mi&s;taken for one another, and that no body at la&s;t
could well tell which was the <HI>Count,</HI> and which was the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>THO' the <HI>Count,</HI> as the Phra&s;e goes of him, looks <HI>bad</HI> enough at the <HI>be&s;t,</HI> he was remark'd to look much
wor&s;e after this Vi&s;ion, than at any time before: He was for many Days much
dejected, and profoundly pen&s;ive and melan|choly, and the terrible
Apprehen&s;ions he was under, cau&s;ed a vi&s;ible Increa&s;e of Wrinkles, and
furrow'd him into &s;uch Frightfulne&s;s, that if ever he went to <HI>take
Coach,</HI> the <HI>Hor&s;es</HI> wou'd &s;tart, and run away from
him.&mdash;But one Day, above the re&s;t, when he was deep in the doleful Mood,
an airy young Fellow hear|ing him &s;ay, He intended to have no more <HI>Ma&s;querades,</HI> got out of him the <HI>Secret</HI> of his <HI>Di&s;order:</HI> This Youth who was afraid, that if that Diver&s;ion
di&s;continued, he &s;hould not &s;uc|ceed with a Lady, for who&s;e &s;ake He
was us'd to <HI>hide</HI> his <HI>Face,</HI> that he might charm her, with
le&s;s Difficulty, found an Expedient <PB N="13" REF="22"> to free the <HI>Count</HI> from his Fears, and made him believe, that it was a <HI>Trick</HI> of the <HI>Prince de Monte A&s;pero.</HI> But the poor <HI>Count</HI> is im|po&s;ed on, if he gives Credit to that fictitious Story,
and might have been better advertis'd of the Truth, if he had only had an Eye
to the <HI>Club-Foot,</HI> which &s;tood out, and <HI>plainly &s;hewed</HI> his
Companion, as &s;everal innocent Spectators then pre&s;ent could te&s;tify.
Be&s;ides, as a <HI>Poet,</HI> who would pre&s;erve <HI>Probability,</HI> could
produce no Body proper to per&s;onate <HI>Amphitryon</HI> but <HI>Jupiter,</HI>
nor to mimick <HI>Sofia</HI> to the Life but <HI>Mercury</HI>; &s;o the <HI>Count,</HI> if he reflects &s;ufficiently, upon his Per&s;on, Parts, and
Qualities, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be convinc'd, in his Mind, that &s;ince
nothing <HI>Human</HI> could &s;o exactly re&s;emble him, It <HI>mu&s;t</HI>
be, at lea&s;t, a <HI>Cacodaemon.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the whole, if he lay this &s;eriou&s;ly to heart, as I hope
he will, he will lay a&s;ide je&s;ting, become a true Penitent, and take the
good Time of <HI>Lent</HI> to con&s;ider, Whether it will not be proper to quit
all Thoughts of <HI>Ma&s;querading,</HI> for fear that Gha&s;tly Figure that
once took his Per&s;on <HI>upon</HI> him, &s;hou'd the next Time, <HI>take
off</HI> his Per&s;on.</P>

his <HI>Fa|mily,</HI> from being known, &s;o that it will be enough to inform
the <HI>Reader,</HI> That, le&s;s than half an <HI>Age</HI> ago, there liv'd a
certain Gentle|man, of good <HI>Birth</HI> and <HI>Fortune,</HI> who had
poli&s;h'd, and fini&s;h'd, a Learned Education by the Improvement of a <HI>Camp,</HI> and a <HI>Court</HI>; in Both which He &s;pent &s;ome Time; when
about the Thirtieth Year of his Age, he thought fit to &s;ettle him&s;elf in
the World, and change his <HI>Condition,</HI> by chu&s;ing a Partner of <HI>Life,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Mind</HI> was as well Adorn'd, as her <HI>Per|&s;on</HI> was Engaging: This happy <HI>Couple</HI> &s;pent Five Years
together, in perfect Felicity; the <HI>Husband</HI> with Reputation, as well as
Fortune, and the <HI>Wife</HI> with Vertue, not inferior to her Beauty.</P>
<P>BUT what crown'd all their <HI>Bli&s;s,</HI> was, That mutual <HI>E&s;teem</HI> they had contracted for one another; in this time they had
two or three <HI>Children,</HI> who all dy'd in their Infancy: And now, it
pleas'd Heaven to &s;natch, from this <HI>happy</HI> Man, the only Joy and
Comfort of his <HI>Life</HI>; his Charming Spou&s;e died, and left him not only
an incon&s;olable, but almo&s;t di&s;tracted, <HI>Widower:</HI> When the
fir&s;t Emotions <PB N="16" REF="25"> of <HI>Grief</HI> were over, he retir'd,
from his own Hou&s;e, to a little Farm, in another <HI>Country,</HI> where no <HI>Object</HI> &s;hould come in his <HI>way,</HI> to revive in his Memory the <HI>Lo&s;s</HI> of his lament|ed <HI>Wife:</HI> Here he &s;pent two Years,
which led him into the Thirty Eighth of his <HI>Life:</HI> this Time he divided
between his Studies and Devotion; being <HI>Religious</HI> from his very
In|fancy: Which natural <HI>Piety</HI> was, now, &s;o much increas'd, by his
late Lo&s;s, that at la&s;t he re&s;olv|ed to quit his Native Country, and to
retire into a <HI>Convent,</HI> being born, and bred in the Roman Catholick
Communion.</P>
<P>THIS Re&s;olution was no &s;ooner known to his Friends, but they
endeavour'd to <HI>divert</HI> it, by all manner of <HI>Per&s;ua&s;ions</HI>
and <HI>Arguments</HI>; by remon&s;trating to him, That he was, now, in the
Flower of his Age, and ble&s;t with a plentiful <HI>Fortune</HI> to give him
all the Comforts and Plea&s;ures of <HI>Life</HI>; that it would be un|ju&s;t,
thus, to fling him&s;elf away, not only to him&s;elf, but his Friends and
Family, to whom he ow'd the Debt, which he had contracted, for Po&s;terity to
continue his Name: They told him, That he had paid all the Tribute to the
Memory of his deceas'd Wife, that the Laws of Honour, Decency, and the
Obligations of a good Husband required; that he was now at Liberty to make
another Choice; that one good Woman was not a Phoenix, but that others of the
&s;ame Species might be found, to make him as happy as before.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="26">THESE Arguments, tho' back'd with Rea|&s;on,
were all ineffectual; he was deaf to every Remon&s;trance; and pa&s;s'd over
into <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he plac'd him&s;elf, at fir&s;t, as Pen&s;ioner
in a Religious Hou&s;e; and liv'd with the &s;ame Strictne&s;s, that even the
Rules of that Order requir'd from tho&s;e, who were under Vows of &s;uch
Au&s;terities; nor did he receive more Edi|fication from the Example of others,
than he gave by his own.</P>
<P>AFTER a Life led, for &s;ome time, with the greate&s;t E&s;teem
and Reputation, he com|municated to the Superiors of the Hou&s;e, his ardent
De&s;ire of being receiv'd into their Society: The good Fathers, tho' inwardly
pleas'd with the Honour of having &s;o excellent a Per&s;on, in their Order,
did not receive his Propo&s;al with that Chearfulne&s;s, which he ex|pected:
Their Prudence &s;ugge&s;ted to them, that he was yet too young a Man, to be
real|ly, upon good Grounds, di&s;gu&s;ted with the World, into the Love of
which he lay under great Temptations of relap&s;ing, by rea&s;on of that large
Fortune, which could furni&s;h Means of enjoying tho&s;e Plea&s;ures, which he
mu&s;t now for ever abandon; and the Lo&s;s of which, if he &s;hould repent his
Vows, would make him as mi&s;erable, as he propos'd to him&s;elf to to be
happy: They conjur'd him, at the &s;ame time, &s;trictly to &s;earch his own
Heart, &s;o as to be convinced, that this De&s;ire was an Im|pul&s;e, and Call
from God, and not any Tem|porary Di&s;gu&s;t of the World, which might 
<PB N="18" REF="27"> blow over, and vani&s;h in time: He &s;ubmit|ted to this
Propo&s;al, and in a little time a&s;&s;ur'd them, That it proceeded from the
Di|rections of that Providence, to who&s;e Service he had &s;o &s;trong and
glorious a Pa&s;&s;ion to de|dicate the re&s;t of his Life: Upon this, the
Society con&s;ented, on Condition, That he would undergo a double Noviciate,
that by the length of the Time, they might be a&s;&s;ur'd of his be|ing
confirm'd in tho&s;e pious Re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>THIS he accepted, and immediately &s;ent over Powers into his own
Country, to convey and &s;ettle his E&s;tate upon his Heir, which was
accordingly done; and the Time of his Novice|&s;hip being expir'd, he took his
Vows, and em|braced that Life in which he propos'd to him|&s;elf &s;o much
Heavenly Satisfaction.</P>
<P>HE had not thus lived long in the Convent, but his great Capacity
and Learning, render'd him too nece&s;&s;ary to the Service of his Order, to be
kept at home; by Command of his Su|periors he went on &s;everal Commi&s;&s;ions
into other Countries, where he executed the Orders, which he had receiv'd, with
wonderful Ad|dre&s;s and Fidelity; at the &s;ame time acquiring an univer&s;al
Reputation, for his extraordinary Sanctity of Life.</P>
<P>HIS Fortune &s;ettled him, at la&s;t, in <HI>France,</HI> where he
met with the &s;ame E&s;teem, and Veneration, as in other Countries, being
uni|ver&s;ally care&s;s'd, and admir'd: At la&s;t his ardent Zeal for the
Service of God, inflam'd him with a pa&s;&s;ionate De&s;ire of laying 
<PB N="19" REF="28"> down his Life, in a&s;&s;erting the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t;
nothing wou'd now &s;atisfy his grow|ing Fervour, but to be &s;ent on a
Mi&s;&s;ion, to convert Infidels to the Chri&s;tian Faith, in which Employ he
had the holy Ambition to meet with a Crown of Martyrdom. This pious
In|clination he communicated to the Superiors of his Order, but was repul&s;ed
in his Reque&s;t, being told, That Men of le&s;s Weight, than he, might be as
&s;erviceable in the Conver&s;ion of Savages; that le&s;s Abilities, than his,
were &s;ufficient to in&s;truct Nations, &s;o &s;tupidly igno|rant; that his
Pre&s;ence was more nece&s;&s;ary in <HI>Europe,</HI> where they had &s;o many
Learned Ad|ver&s;aries to combat.</P>
<P>THIS Repul&s;e not a little mortify'd the Zeal of the good Father,
who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion for Martyrdom was now more inflam'd, by hearing, That there
was a new Mi&s;&s;ion of <HI>French Je&s;uits</HI> going over to <HI>America:</HI> He apply'd him&s;elf to the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Quebec,</HI> who was ju&s;t upon his Departure for <HI>Canada</HI>; this
Prelate was &s;o charm'd with the Zeal, and Piety of the Man, who&s;e Character
he had heard before, that he enter'd into his Sentiments, and made u&s;e of the
Intere&s;t he had in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> to get the Reque&s;t of this
New Apo&s;tle granted by Authority. Thus, Ma&s;ter of his Wi&s;hes, he went
over with the Bi&s;hop to <HI>Canada,</HI> where he met with as much Veneration
of his Piety, Humility, and all other Chri&s;tian Vertues, in <HI>America,</HI>
as he left behind him in <HI>Europe:</HI> After &s;ome time of Refre&s;hment,
he prepar'd <PB N="20" REF="29"> for his Apo&s;tolical Function, and went with
his Collegues, among the mo&s;t &s;avage, and cruel Nations of the <HI>Indians:</HI> Some of his Com|rades were murther'd by the&s;e People;
others died of the Hard&s;hips and Fatigues which they endured, while our
Mi&s;&s;ionary e&s;cap'd, thro' the Goodne&s;s of his Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>IN this fir&s;t Expedition, he was &s;everal times in imminent
Danger of Life, having once the Knife over his Head to &s;calp him; but
Providence, who&s;e Secrets are un&s;earchable, pre&s;erv'd him, and would not
vouch&s;afe that Honour, which he &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ir'd, of dying a
Martyr: In this fir&s;t Attempt, he &s;uc|ceeded &s;o far, as to vanqui&s;h the
Ob&s;tinacy and Ignorance of Twenty-two <HI>Indian</HI> Men and Women, whom he
baptiz'd, and brought with him to <HI>Quebec</HI>; which Town he enter'd,
tri|umphantly, with his Converts. The Reader may gue&s;s at the Veneration paid
him by the People, who look'd on him as a Saint and Apo|&s;tle, and pre&s;t
near to touch, and ki&s;s his very Garments: The Winter Months he was oblig'd
to &s;pend his Time at <HI>Quebec,</HI> it being impo&s;|&s;ible to pre&s;erve
Life in &s;o cold a Country, without the Cover of Hou&s;es again&s;t the
Incle|mency of the Air: The Summer-Sea&s;ons were taken up, entirely, by the
Labours of his Mi&s;|&s;ion, in which he had wonderful Succe&s;s the third
Winter, at which time he approach'd the 50th Year of his Age: The Governour,
who had a profound Re&s;pect for him, invited the good Mi&s;&s;ioner to come
and re&s;ide at his Hou&s;e, <PB N="21" REF="30"> with a Reque&s;t to
in&s;truct his Daughter, who de&s;ired to learn Languages, and Mathematicks:
The good Father chearfully undertook his New Province, and very
a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly attended his young Pupil, the Pregnancy of who&s;e Parts made
his Pains the more agreeable: This Lady was about Eighteen Years old, with a
Per&s;on equal to the Beauties of her Mind, and all the Vivacity &s;o natural
to her Country: The Preceptor had not often attended his fair Scho|lar, but he
found tho&s;e Emotions in his Heart, which, in a little time &s;hipwreck'd his
Ver|tue; he fell de&s;perately in Love, and thro' the Eyes, &s;uck'd in that
Poy&s;on, which now taint|ed a Soul, that &s;o much Vertue had long, and
con&s;tantly defended before: LOVE, that in|vincible Tyrant, entirely
&s;ubdued, and added the Heart of this once Holy Man, to his other Triumphs: In
order to make him&s;elf the more agreeable, he cut off his Beard, and now put
on Linnen, next his Skin, which he had not worn for &s;ome Years, the more to
in|dulge his Mortification, tho' he was not oblig'd to that Au&s;terity by the
Rules of his Order: That Devotion, which had flam'd &s;o long in his Heart
towards God Almighty, was now turn'd into Adoration of one of his Creatures;
LOVE converting all others Pa&s;&s;ions into it&s;elf, as the Plague does all
other Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, he managed his Amours with that Addre&s;s, That, at
la&s;t, he triumph'd, and gra|tify'd his Criminal De&s;ires; the Fruits of
which &s;oon appear'd; the young Dam&s;el was with <PB N="22" REF="31"> Child,
which flung the Lovers into the la&s;t Confu&s;ion and Di&s;tre&s;s: There was
no Re|medy, but one, which was, To fly; accord|ingly one Night, the Summer now
advancing, &s;o as to permit them to lie in the Woods, they got over the
Ramparts, and fled to the <HI>Indians,</HI> among whom he had a great
Intere&s;t, and who now receiv'd them with open Arms. As he had &s;een &s;ome
Campaigns in his Youth, and under&s;tood Fortification, and the Mathe|matical
Part of War, he began to Train and Di&s;cipline the Savages, whom he
per&s;uaded to revolt again&s;t the <HI>French:</HI> In the mean while, the
Governour, overwhelm'd with Grief for this terrible Misfortune in his Family,
&s;ent out &s;everal &s;mall Parties to bring them back; but the&s;e were
defeated by the Superiority of Num|bers; upon which the Governour march'd with
the whole Garri&s;on, and all the Fighting Men he could mu&s;ter; the Lovers
animated and en|courag'd the Savages, whom they brought, in great Numbers, to
oppo&s;e the Enemy; the little Armies came in &s;ight, and while the Two
Unfortunate Lovers &s;tood clo&s;e to one another, &s;he, with an <HI>Indian</HI> Quiver at her Back, and Bow in her Hand, the fir&s;t Fire from
the <HI>French</HI> laid them both on the Ground; Such was the &s;ad
Cata&s;trophe of this unhappy Man, who&s;e Piety, and good Life, for &s;o many
Years, could not prevent his Falling, at la&s;t, &s;o Memorable an Example of <HI>The Imbecility of all Human Ac|compli&s;hments.</HI></P>

<P>HOW would the decea&s;ed <HI>Bucharis</HI> have been able to leap

<PB N="24" REF="33"> Winter, whom he knew to have been his Su|perior in Wealth,
and Magnificence, till <HI>he</HI> reduc'd him to this <HI>Di&s;parity?</HI>
Can my Rea|ders imagine, That <HI>Cartaerarius</HI> mu&s;t not lo&s;e the

think he can be Brute enough to enjoy him&s;elf upon the Reflection of his
different Fortune, and of the Tricks he had play'd in his Life, and the <HI>Num|bers</HI> he had made as wretched, as the <HI>Object</HI> I have
mentioned?</P>
<P>THIS is a &s;trange and melancholy <HI>Fate:</HI> a Box and Dice
heartily &s;tamp'd upon a Table here in <HI>London,</HI> &s;hall have a more
powerful Effect, on the Walls of a &s;trong-built Ca&s;tle in the <HI>Country,</HI> than the firing of Twenty <HI>Mor|ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> again&s;t it could have had, on the Spot, and

Di&s;|cretion,</HI> with all the Territories round about it, to one who is <HI>innocently</HI> called, a <HI>fair Enemy,</HI> and who attacks it in <HI>Play</HI> only.</P>
<P>IT is &s;till more &s;trange, That a Cu&s;tom, which has been
known to have brought &s;uch uncom|mon Calamities upon the greate&s;t and
riche&s;t Men, &s;hould at la&s;t become common, among the common People
them&s;elves: And yet this was lately the Ca&s;e. Trade&s;men and Sharpers of a
Lower Rank, committed the like Ho&s;ti|lities, and Shops were &s;hut up <HI>by
way of Gaming.</HI> I know one <HI>Wi&s;e Man</HI> an <HI>Apothecary,</HI> who
ne|glected his <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> to become <HI>Rich,</HI> and has been
&s;een to lo&s;e more Money by &s;haking his Elbow over a <HI>Gaming-Table</HI>
in three Hours, than he <PB N="25" REF="34"> could recover by brandi&s;hing his
Arm over a <HI>Mortar</HI> in three times as many Months.</P>
<P>I AM the more &s;lack in my Remarks, and throw together only a few
loo&s;e Hints again&s;t this vicious Habit, becau&s;e a more effectual Way has
been lately taken to check its Progre&s;s. And, if People of Fa&s;hion did not
think them|&s;elves above the Benefit of tho&s;e Laws which vulgar Per&s;ons
are cautious of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing, for fear of being treated as Cheats, and
Im|po&s;tors, this Di&s;cour&s;e would be render'd u&s;e|le&s;s. The Nature of
Impo&s;ture, is no other|wi&s;e alter'd, by being the Fact of a Per&s;on of
Di&s;tinction, but by its becoming more highly Criminal. Out of Per&s;ons of
Fa&s;hion and E&s;tate, are generally cho&s;en tho&s;e, who are obliged to
watch over the publick Welfare: And can they guard Property in publick Life,
who lay Snares to entrap it in a private Capacity? No Man &s;hould be allow'd
to appear in an A&s;&s;em|bly of <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> who has made him&s;elf
a <HI>Member</HI> among the Surrounders of a <HI>Hazard Table.</HI> There have
been of late but <HI>Two</HI> Game&s;ters, that &s;tepp'd high enough to have
any Rule in publick Affairs entru&s;ted to their Management, <HI>Exlex</HI> and
the young <HI>Montanus</HI>; the&s;e, tho' otherwi&s;e Men of &s;ignal
Capacities, and many worthy Qualifications, could not re&s;i&s;t their Natural
Propen&s;ity, and thereby infus'd into two Kingdoms &s;uch an univer&s;al
Spirit of <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Gaming,</HI> by &s;trange Schemes, 'till
then unheard-of, as mu&s;t, if continued, have <PB N="26" REF="35"> &s;oon
accompli&s;h'd the Ruin, which they threaten'd at their fir&s;t Appearance.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>Gaming</HI> in lower Life, the Ju&s;tices of the Peace
have acted with &s;uch commendable Vigilance, That they have &s;carce left me a
known Sharper in the Town, to exerci&s;e the Edge of my Satire upon. Mo&s;t of
them have, I believe, by this time, taken to the more <HI>ho|nourable</HI> way
of Robbing with a <HI>Pi&s;tol</HI> and <HI>Brace of Balls</HI> in it, which is
much le&s;s <HI>dangerous</HI> to the <HI>Offended,</HI> and le&s;s <HI>&s;afe</HI> to the <HI>Offender,</HI> than a <HI>Box</HI> with a <HI>Pair
of Dice</HI> in it: Others have gone in Gangs like Foot-pads, and while one
knock'd down the Pa&s;&s;enger, the other rifled him, which is only a kind of <HI>Emblem</HI> of their Play called <HI>Two poll One.</HI> Thus I believe,
that, if a &s;trict Scrutiny were made into the Num|bers that are left, of the <HI>Fraternity,</HI> we &s;hould find, that, &s;ince the happy Di&s;&s;olution
of that Knot, mo&s;t of the loo&s;e ones have been &s;wept away, by his
Maje&s;ty's indu&s;trious Subject Mr. <HI>Jonathan Forward</HI> Rear-Admiral of
the <HI>City Tran&s;ports.</HI></P>
<P>BUT there is a Species of more mi&s;chie|vous <HI>Game&s;ters</HI>
remaining &s;till among us, who ought, methinks, to have had free Pa&s;&s;age
in &s;ome of that Great <HI>Pilot</HI>'s Ve&s;&s;els&mdash;I mean, the
pre&s;ent <HI>Fraternity</HI> of <HI>Stock-jobbers.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>Brotherhood,</HI> who play their Game upon the Hopes and
Fears, of other People, make u&s;e of <HI>cant</HI> Names, as the <HI>Game&s;ters</HI> did, and with ju&s;t the &s;ame Propriety. The <HI>Game|&s;ters</HI> called their In&s;truments of Mi&s;chief by the 
<PB N="27" REF="36"> Denomination of <HI>Squibs</HI> and <HI>Puffs,</HI> and
the <HI>Stock-jobbers</HI> have their <HI>Bulls</HI> and <HI>Bears</HI>; nor
were <HI>tho&s;e</HI> half &s;o formidable in <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> as <HI>the&s;e</HI> are about the <HI>Royal-Exchange,</HI> in <HI>Corn|hill.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Bear</HI> is a Bea&s;t of Prey, who, not having perhaps a
Mor&s;el in the World, appears with the Pretence of a whole <HI>Paw full</HI>
of <HI>Stock,</HI> which he agrees to deliver on a Day. But, if <HI>Stock</HI>
ri&s;es, he mu&s;t, as the Phra&s;e is, <HI>Shew his Tail,</HI> that is, he
mu&s;t <HI>Run away.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Bull</HI> is ju&s;t the Rever&s;e of this: He, is as
Pennyle&s;s as his Brother Bea&s;t, but roars and bellows for <HI>Stock,</HI>
and <HI>Devours</HI> all that is offer'd him; and if, at the Time when it is to
be paid for, it happens to fall, then he too mu&s;t <HI>Run off,</HI> as the <HI>Bear</HI> did.</P>
<P>NUMBERS of hone&s;t Trade&s;men are delu|ded by the&s;e <HI>odd
Bea&s;ts,</HI> and kept warm with imaginary <HI>Hopes</HI> of turning their
Money better and fa&s;ter upon <HI>Stocks,</HI> than in Bu&s;ine&s;s: And where
the Unskilful are drawn in to try their Fortunes this way, their Money becomes
a <HI>Sa|crifice</HI> to the <HI>Jobbers,</HI> and them&s;elves <HI>Bankrupts</HI> to the <HI>Publick: Bulls</HI> and <HI>Bears,</HI> as
oppo&s;ite as they are in their Natures, agree very well together, and
&s;ometimes per&s;onate one another to draw in an hone&s;t Citizen; and if he
once gets between <HI>both,</HI> by that Time the <HI>Stocks,</HI> have had a
few Variations to and fro, he is &s;ure, by their <HI>to&s;&s;ing</HI> him from
one to t'other, to be <HI>worried</HI> out of his Sen&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="37">MY Friend the <HI>Alderman,</HI> who has
&s;ome|times a way of Je&s;ting peculiar to him&s;elf, &s;ays, That when he has
been running over the <HI>Ad|verti&s;ements,</HI> relating to Bankrupts in our <HI>Ga|zettes,</HI> he would frequently make Marks on the Margin, denoting,
Where &s;uch a <HI>broken-hearted</HI> Butcher has been forced to &s;hut up his
Stall upon being Gored by the <HI>Horn</HI> of a <HI>Bull</HI>; and where the <HI>Paw</HI> of a <HI>Bear</HI> has pulled a rich Linnen-Draper by the Head and
Ears, over his Counter. I warrant you, my old Friend, (will he often &s;ay, for
he is apt to dwell upon old <HI>Jokes</HI>) when the Watch-Tower of <HI>Barbi|can</HI> was &s;tanding, the &s;harpe&s;t Eye of any Man that &s;tood
in it, could never perceive round this whole City, one &s;uch voracious
Ani|mal, threatning Ruin to the Inhabitants, as the Modern <HI>Bulls</HI> and <HI>Bears</HI> are.</P>
<P>IT is certain, That the <HI>Alderman</HI>'s <HI>Je&s;t</HI> was
true in <HI>Earne&s;t.</HI> For our wi&s;e Ance&s;tors made whol&s;ome Laws for
extirpating all wild and mi&s;chievous Bea&s;ts out of the Land, and &s;et a
Price upon their Heads. It mu&s;t be therefore very wrong in &s;uch a Populous
Town as this, to permit <HI>Bulls,</HI> and unmuzzled <HI>Bears,</HI> to have
their Stalls and Dens about <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> where they have
Opportunity to run out and de&s;troy unwary Citizens. Be&s;ides, the <HI>Alder|man</HI> told me (as a Remark of his Wife,) That under Boa&s;t of the
va&s;t <HI>Stocks</HI> they deal for, they tempt the yielding Hearts of many a
rich Citizen's Daughter, and pin them&s;elves on Fa|milies to be kept without a
Groat, and &s;ome|times <PB N="29" REF="38"> take a <HI>Bite</HI> of the young
Lady, in that Part they like be&s;t, and then run away, with|out <HI>coming</HI> to <HI>account</HI> for it. She &s;ays, That Mr. <HI>Honeyman,</HI> a Sugar Baker, has Two Cubs upon his Daughter's hands, by a <HI>Bear</HI> that has left the <HI>Alley</HI>; and that Mr. <HI>Simple</HI>'s
Favourite Child is upon the Point of being delivered of a Calf, begot by a
&s;illy awkward <HI>Bull,</HI> that <HI>Bur&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, by <HI>&s;wallowing Stock,</HI> beyond the Power of his natural <HI>Dige&s;tion.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are Things not to be tolerated in any Civil Government
what&s;oever; for they manife&s;tly tend to the Ruin of Commerce; and at this
rate it will come to pa&s;s in the cour&s;e of a few Years, That while <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> is poli&s;hing its rough Inhabitants into the finer
Re&s;emblance of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> the Politene&s;s of <HI>Britain</HI>

greate&s;t Part of this Metropolis will be over|run with an unheard-of
Generation of <HI>Savages</HI> and <HI>Mon&s;ters.</HI> It is, therefore, my
&s;erious Opi|nion, That the Practice &s;hou'd be put down; and that for the
Quiet and Safety of <HI>&s;ober Citizens,</HI> every <HI>Bull</HI> and <HI>Bear</HI> of them all, &s;hould be fir&s;t driven out of the City, by the

happen'd very lately;&mdash;<HI>And it contains,</HI> added &s;he, <HI>&s;o

find a Man, who would be</HI> Mine <HI>upon &s;uch Terms, I &s;hall</HI> Marry, <HI>and bid Defiance to the Sound of the Word</HI> Matron!</P>
<P><HI>COURTHOPE</HI> was the Son of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant,
who had liv'd long in the <HI>Canary I&s;lands</HI>; he had been &s;ent young
to <HI>London,</HI> for the Advantage of his Education, and (while there) fell
in <HI>Love</HI> with <HI>Bellaria,</HI> the only Daughter of a Gentleman of a
good Family and E&s;tate, who had promis'd this Lady to a di&s;tant Relation,
of his Name: But &s;he had an Aver&s;ion for his Per&s;on, and made open
Profe&s;&s;ion of a Pa&s;&s;ion for young <HI>Courthope,</HI> which the Father
was &s;o far from approving, that, being provok'd by her Firmne&s;s, he
command|ed her, under Penalty of his Hatred, and his Cur&s;e, never more to
conver&s;e with him; and confin'd her, from that time forward, to pre|vent even
the Po&s;&s;ibility of it. <HI>Bellaria,</HI> not|with&s;tanding this
Re&s;traint, found means to e&s;cape, and dre&s;&s;ing her &s;elf in Boy's
Cloaths, imbark'd with <HI>Courthope,</HI> on a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship, that
was bound for the <HI>Canaries</HI>; where he a&s;&s;ur'd her, they would be
welcome to a <HI>Fa|ther,</HI> who&s;e gentle Nature knew nothing of 
<PB N="34" REF="43"> that <HI>Rigour,</HI> which, from her Infancy, &s;he had
been oppre&s;s'd by. They were taken in this Voyage, by a <HI>Moori&s;h</HI>
Ve&s;&s;el, belonging to the Rovers of <HI>Sallee:</HI> And 'tis ea&s;ier to
conceive, than expre&s;s, the Affliction, the De&s;pair, the A&s;toni&s;hment
of <HI>Courthope:</HI> fallen, at once, from a Pro&s;pect of the &s;weete&s;t,
and mo&s;t live|ly Joy, to the Depth of con&s;ummate Mi&s;ery! He &s;aw <HI>Her,</HI> now, the Companion of his <HI>Sla|very,</HI> who had wi&s;h'd,
and ventur'd, &s;o much, to make <HI>Him</HI> Partner of her <HI>Affluence</HI>; and he &s;uffer'd more than Death, every time, that his
Eyes, all &s;wimming in Tears, &s;tole a Glance, at his <HI>Bellaria,</HI> whom
he dur&s;t not di&s;tingui&s;h, by any Marks of Re&s;pect, or Service, for fear
of pointing out her <HI>Sex,</HI> to the Brutes, who were their Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>BUT what aggravated his Sorrow, to the mo&s;t piercing Extremity,
was, an Information he receiv'd from a Native of the <HI>Canaries,</HI> whom he
found a Slave at <HI>Sallee,</HI> That his Fa|ther was newly dead, and that all
his Effects had been &s;eiz'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> on Occa&s;ion of
&s;ome Criminal Corre&s;pondencies, which he had unwarily been drawn into.</P>
<P>THEY pa&s;s'd about a Week, with the re&s;t of their Ship's
Company, in a publick Dun|geon of the City, where they were to expect the
killing Summons, which mu&s;t expo&s;e them in a <HI>Market,</HI> to be &s;old,
and torn for ever from the Enjoyment of that mutual Comfort, which was, now,
the only Thought, that could &s;up|port 'em in their Wretchedne&s;s. The Moon, 
<PB N="35" REF="44"> one Night, &s;hone clearly thro' the Grates of the
Pri&s;on Windows; and <HI>Courthope,</HI> while the re&s;t were a&s;leep, hung,
in melancholy Tran&s;|port, over the Bo&s;om of <HI>Bellaria,</HI> who
&s;tarted, in broken Slumbers, and fill'd his Soul with &s;ad Reflections. He
took Notice of a rugged Stone, which ro&s;e, pointed, thro' the Earth, and
imagining it might hurt her, remov'd it, with much Difficulty, and had no
&s;ooner drawn it out, but he di&s;cover'd an old Piece of Wool|len Cloth,
which had formerly been hidden under it, in which were Sixty <HI>Moidores,</HI>
Two <HI>Gold Rings,</HI> and a <HI>Writing</HI> which he perceiv'd to have been <HI>French,</HI> but now defac'd, and not legible,</P>
<P>HE approach'd <HI>Bellaria</HI>'s Ear, and awak'd her, in all the
Ec&s;tacy of a Man, who con&s;ider'd him&s;elf, as di&s;tingui&s;hed by <HI>Providence:</HI> He whi&s;per'd his new Hopes, of an immediate Redemption;
and found Means &s;oon after, by Aid of an hone&s;t <HI>Jew,</HI> a Man of much
Charity, who vi&s;ited the Slaves every Morning, to be carried to the <HI>Alcaid</HI>; and, tru&s;ting his Gold with the <HI>Jew,</HI> propos'd to
ran&s;om <HI>Him&s;elf</HI> and <HI>Bellaria,</HI> whom he called his Brother:
But the Conflict of his Pa&s;&s;ions had &s;o vi&s;ible an Effect, in his
Looks, and his Earne&s;tne&s;s, that the <HI>Alcaid</HI> took Advantage, from
what he ob&s;erved, and in&s;i&s;ted on the whole Sum, for the Liberty, of <HI>One</HI> only, which was offered him, for <HI>Both.</HI>&mdash;He bid him
name, at his Choice, either his Brother, or him&s;elf; but advi&s;ed him to
lo&s;e no Time, for an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sloop was ready <PB N="36" REF="45">
to &s;ail out of the Harbour, with ran&s;om'd Captives on Board, and would
carry him to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> where his Countrymen were in
Gar|ri&s;on:&mdash;He added too, That all the <HI>Chri|&s;tian Slaves</HI> in <HI>Sallee,</HI> were to &s;et out the next Morning, for <HI>Mequinez,</HI> to
work on &s;ome New Buildings of the Emperor of <HI>Morocco.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Courthope</HI> trembled with Jealou&s;y; and a Thou&s;and
different Fears, at the di&s;tracting Imagination of <HI>Bellaria,</HI> in the
Eye and Power of &s;uch a Tyrant!&mdash;He went out with the <HI>Jew,</HI> and
took a &s;udden Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>ABOUT Noon the &s;ame Day, the <HI>Jew</HI> re|turned to the
Pri&s;on, and carried with him an Order for the Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Bellaria</HI>; who, en|quiring after <HI>Courthope,</HI> was told, He went
be|fore, to prepare Things for her Reception, on Board the Ve&s;&s;el, they
were to embark in; and had given him Orders to conduct her thither immediately.
Never was any Order obey'd with &s;o much Tran&s;port; the <HI>Jew</HI> hir'd a
Boat, and attending her to the Ship, return'd, abrupt|ly, to the Town, without
taking Leave of her:&mdash;She was led into the Cabbin, where, ex|pecting to
find her Lover, &s;he was receiv'd by the Ma&s;ter of the Ve&s;&s;el, with whom
the <HI>Jew</HI> had been before, and who deliver'd her a Let|ter, which &s;he
open'd, with trembling Hands, and read in it, what follows.</P>

<P>THOUGH <HI>Good-Breeding</HI> and <HI>Politene&s;s,</HI> are

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Mr. <HI>Plain-Dealer:</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL Yours, yet publi&s;h'd, have regular|ly receiv'd, and note
their Contents. I thought it proper to let you know, That al|though I am a <HI>Cooper,</HI> I lov'd her as well as her <HI>finical Turkey-Merchant.</HI>
But I forgot to let you know, fir&s;t, That the needful of this Letter is, That
&s;he, that I mean, is a pretty, young Woman, worth a Brace and a half of <HI>Thou&s;ands.</HI> But that makes nothing to the Story: I had <HI>Money
enough,</HI> for that Matter; and tho' I was no powder'd <HI>fine Fellow,</HI>
with a finical white Wig, yet I valued and e&s;teemed her, as if I had been the
Mother that bore her: And I &s;hould have been glad, when Heaven &s;aw fit, to
have had her in <PB N="40" REF="49"> her <HI>Smock!</HI> And &s;o, <HI>mayhap,</HI> now I think on't, wou'd her Beau too; but I mean in an <HI>hone&s;t way</HI> only. But what matters that? <HI>Fair and Fal&s;e</HI>
was an old Saying in its Time! And if I had &s;tuck clo&s;e to my Calling, and
valued her no more than the Paring of my Nails, I had been a better Man for it,
by &s;ome <HI>Hundreds.</HI> But there is no &s;etting <HI>Old Heads</HI> upon <HI>Young Shoulders.</HI> Every Body knows, I am no <HI>Brag&s;ter</HI>; and,
tho' I &s;ay it, that &s;hould not, I could have lov'd the very Ground that
&s;he <HI>went</HI> upon: And very un|happy &s;he has made me, that's certain;
where|by, I hope, &s;omebody that is higher than &s;he, will remember her for
it, in the <HI>La&s;t Day,</HI> for then all <HI>Secrets</HI> will be <HI>laid
open.</HI> I can't, for my Life, imagine, what po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es me, but I
&s;hall begin to hate <HI>my own-&s;elf</HI> &s;hortly, if it was, in Nature,
to be po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e, when|ever &s;he comes into my Head, I am ready
to <HI>cry</HI> at the Thoughts of her.</P>
<P>NOW you mu&s;t know, &s;he had told a Friend of mine, that <HI>wi&s;h'd</HI> me to her, not once, nor twice, but that very Day, that he
was leading her Home from <HI>Draper</HI>'s <HI>Gardens,</HI> That &s;he
thought, as how no Man could fall in Love with a <HI>Red-Hair'd Woman.</HI>
But, to &s;ee how &s;trangely Mi&s;takes will come about! this was all but her
own Fancy; for I never once thought of it; nor was never the Man, that had ever
concern'd my &s;elf, with any Thing &s;he had about her. So, becau&s;e I
woud'n't be <HI>uncivil,</HI> I made a great Supper, <PB N="41" REF="50"> and
invited an old Aunt of mine, that &s;he <HI>know'd,</HI> and half a &s;core
young Women, be|&s;ides her&s;elf, to take Part of it: for it <HI>burnt</HI> in
my Mind, &s;trangely. In the middle of the Supper, I watch'd my Time, to drink
to her; and told her, before 'em all, That &s;he might be &s;ure, by my having
no Body to Supper, but <HI>Folks with Red Hair,</HI> as how I &s;hou'dn't like
her a <HI>Crum</HI> the wor&s;e, for <HI>That:</HI> For I didn't care a Pin,
for that mat|ter, if &s;he was as <HI>red</HI> as a <HI>Fox,</HI> all over. To
be &s;ure, &s;he look'd, all Night, after it, as the <HI>Devil lookt over
Lincoln:</HI> And when I went, the Afternoon after, to <HI>make Love</HI> to
her, as I us'd to do, nothing vex'd me, but her &s;ending me down word, by that
pert Go&s;&s;ip, Mrs. <HI>Briget,</HI> (that, I am &s;ure, has had of me, at
Times, in Pre&s;ents, be&s;ides Good Words, to the Value of <HI>Five
Pieces!</HI>) and yet, &s;he bid <HI>Her, for&s;ooth,</HI> to go and tell me,
That I had no need for giving my &s;elf any more Trouble to come there; for her
Mi&s;tre&s;s would have nothing to &s;ay to a <HI>Hoop-driver.</HI></P>
<P>NOW I, knowing, as how we are com|manded to <HI>forgive</HI> all
our <HI>Enemies,</HI> wou'dn't do her <HI>no Harm,</HI> for the World: And

<P>I GUESS'D what the young <HI>Malapert</HI> would be at by the Word <HI>Humour,</HI> and I found I was not deceiv'd, when he pulled out of his
Pocket a little Scrap of Poetry, intitled,&mdash;<HI>An Epi&s;tle from

&s;wore, <HI>There was a great deal of</HI> Turn, Life, <HI>and</HI>
Spirit.</P>
<P>IT is certain, He &s;hewed &s;ome <HI>Spirit</HI> in reading it,
and proved him&s;elf a <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> of <HI>Hu|mour,</HI> for he went <HI>boldly</HI> and <HI>undauntedly</HI> thro' it; and would never ob&s;erve,
that every <HI>fre&s;h Line</HI> excited <HI>fre&s;h Blu&s;hes</HI> in the <HI>Faces</HI> of all the <HI>Fair</HI> and <HI>Mode&s;t</HI> Part of the

<P>HAVING fixed my Place of Re&s;idence, on my Arrival in this

<P>THERE is a <HI>Liveline&s;s,</HI> and Race of <HI>Spirit,</HI>
which we commonly call <HI>Wit</HI>; but it is the <HI>Effect</HI> of <HI>Natural Accident</HI>; and depends, like a <HI>Machine,</HI> upon <HI>Order</HI> and <PB N="53" REF="62"> <HI>Parts.</HI> It is only the <HI>Re&s;ult</HI> of a <HI>Mixture</HI> of <HI>different Humours:</HI> and of
Animal Spirits, <HI>finer</HI> and more <HI>delicately</HI> agitated, than
ordi|nary; which <HI>imprint</HI> in their Pa&s;&s;age, a <HI>quick</HI> and <HI>lively</HI> Sen&s;e of Images; and animate by that Impre&s;&s;ion, the <HI>Vi&s;age, Voice,</HI> and <HI>Deport|ment.</HI></P>
<P>IT is merely by this Quickne&s;s, and Heat of their <HI>Imagination,</HI> that witty Men &s;urprize us. A &s;mart and &s;prightly <HI>Rhetorick!</HI> A hu|morous Turn of <HI>Phra&s;e!</HI> A frank Vivacity of <HI>Mien!</HI> with a <HI>modi&s;h Affectation</HI> of peculiar <HI>Looks,</HI>
and <HI>Ge&s;ture,</HI> make the <HI>Merit</HI> of their <HI>Character.</HI>
But the&s;e Men want, for the mo&s;t Part, both <HI>Strength</HI> of <HI>Mind,</HI> and <HI>Penetration.</HI> Their <HI>Imaginations</HI> are <HI>thin,</HI> and <HI>delicate</HI>; and play <HI>lightly</HI> on the <HI>Skirts</HI> of <HI>Objects:</HI> But they are too <HI>weak</HI> for &s;olid <HI>Rea&s;oning</HI>; and, in any Thing <HI>ab&s;tracted,</HI> and <HI>above</HI> the <HI>Pitch</HI> of the <HI>Sen&s;es,</HI> they are

<P>NO &s;ooner had <HI>Ned Volatile</HI> repeated his <HI>Ver&s;es,</HI> but a General Applau&s;e, of <HI>Laughter,</HI> was return'd

his <HI>Poetry,</HI> with an Air of <HI>Levity,</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction</HI>;
when the <HI>Major,</HI> to prevent <PB N="57" REF="66"> a &s;econd Reading, of
what he &s;aw was <HI>di&s;ta&s;teful</HI> to &s;ome Part of the <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> began to &s;peak in this Manner.</P>
<Q> 
<P>THE Company mu&s;t acknowledge, they are oblig'd to Mr. <HI>Volatile,</HI> for the Pains he is at, to <HI>plea&s;e</HI> them: But, if
he were as <HI>inclinable</HI> to <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> as he is to <HI>entertain,</HI> no Body could convince us &s;ooner, that the <HI>fine&s;t
Ri|dicule</HI> is to be con&s;idered but as <HI>Cruelty,</HI> where it borrows
its Subject from Mens <HI>Natural Defects,</HI> or their <HI>Mi&s;eries.</HI> I
know very well, that whatever &s;avours of <HI>In&s;truction</HI> is
of|fen&s;ive in <HI>Conver&s;ation</HI>; and that nothing is more <HI>in&s;upportable,</HI> than a <HI>Liberty</HI> People take, of pre&s;cribing <HI>Rules</HI> to all the World. We pre&s;ently wi&s;h to fly the Society of
tho&s;e who <HI>dogmatize:</HI> For the Mind of Man is Generous, and <HI>re&s;i&s;ts</HI> Truth, or <HI>receives</HI> it, as its Approaches are <HI>Rude</HI> or <HI>Gentle.</HI> But then, there is an equal Inconvenience in
the <HI>contrary Extream:</HI> And if we wou'd enjoy Conver&s;ation, with a
Delicacy of <HI>Wit,</HI> we &s;hould have Liberty to <HI>bound</HI> it, by the
In|terpo&s;ition of our <HI>Judgment.</HI></P> 
<P>THE <HI>Harmony</HI> of this Lady, who has &s;o agreeably
entertain'd us, is a <HI>Beauty</HI> that might weigh again&s;t the Ab&s;ence
of other Charms, more frequent, and perhaps le&s;s valuable! 'Tis the Motherly
Indulgence of <HI>Nature,</HI> to rob us of <HI>no</HI> Benefit, without
be&s;towing on us &s;ome other, in a double Proportion. How &s;eldom do we find <HI>all</HI> Accompli&s;hments united in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Per&s;on! 
<PB N="58" REF="67"> <HI>Some</HI> are <HI>happy</HI> in their Humour, and have
their Spirits full of <HI>Fire</HI>; and <HI>&s;wift</HI> and <HI>&s;ubtil</HI>
in their <HI>Motion. Others,</HI> not &s;o <HI>&s;prightly,</HI> have a Blood
more <HI>cold</HI> and <HI>phlegmatic</HI>; but the Cour&s;e of their Animal
Spirits being <HI>tempe|rately</HI> regulated, they are <HI>cautious</HI> in <HI>Deli|beration, &s;trong</HI> and <HI>con&s;tant</HI> in <HI>Re&s;olution</HI>; and <HI>un&s;haken</HI> in their <HI>Enterprizes.</HI>
How <HI>vi&s;i|ble</HI> is this <HI>Difference! One</HI> is <HI>airy</HI> and <HI>faceti|ous</HI>; the <HI>Other thoughtful</HI> and <HI>judicious.</HI> The <HI>Wit</HI> of <HI>One</HI> is <HI>&s;harp</HI>; the <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Other, &s;olid.</HI></P> 
<P>I REMEMBER to have &s;een, during the la&s;t War in <HI>Flanders,</HI> in a Town where I had my Winter-Quarters, a wonderful
Example of this <HI>Recompence,</HI> ob&s;erv'd by Nature. An old Man, who had
been born blind, and had always continued &s;o, had a natural <HI>Sagacity,</HI> that was <HI>prodigious</HI> and &s;carce <HI>credible!</HI>
A Legacy being left him, to the Value of <HI>Fifty Pi&s;toles,</HI> the poor
Man, who had never ex|pected to be Ma&s;ter of &s;uch a Sum, was un|der no
&s;mall <HI>Solicitude</HI> how to &s;ecure his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. He
determin'd, at la&s;t, to dig a Hole in the Cellar, and hide it: But it
happen'd, that a <HI>Dutch</HI> Soldier, who was quartered in the Hou&s;e,
&s;aw him bury the Pur&s;e, and went afterwards and &s;tole it. The Blind Man
bethinking him&s;elf of a Place <HI>more</HI> convenient, return'd, in an Hour
or two, and di&s;cover'd his Misfortune; for which he con|triv'd an ingenious
Remedy, by <HI>detecting</HI> the <HI>Author</HI> of it, which he judg'd to
have been <PB N="59" REF="68"> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Soldier; but the Difficulty
was, <HI>how</HI> to <HI>prove</HI> it.</P> 
<P>THEY lay in the &s;ame Room; and, at Night, when they were in Bed,
the Blind Man began, under Pretence of Friend&s;hip and Confidence, to
con&s;ult with the Soldier, concerning a Nece&s;&s;ity which he &s;aid, he was
under, to <HI>hide</HI> a <HI>hundred Pi&s;toles.</HI> To &s;ay Truth, added
he, I have <HI>hid fifty</HI> of them <HI>to Day</HI>; and would di&s;po&s;e of
the <HI>other fifty</HI> in the &s;ame Place, to Morrow; only I am de&s;irous
to be &s;atisfy'd, Whether, in Point of <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> &s;uch a
Practice is <HI>unlawful?</HI> My Relations being &s;o extravagant, that they
would <HI>wa&s;te</HI> it all, if they could come at it.</P> 
<P>THE <HI>Soldier</HI> &s;wallowed the <HI>Bait,</HI> and <HI>ar|gued,</HI> like a <HI>Ca&s;ui&s;t,</HI> to confirm the Intenti|on;
expecting, now, to get it <HI>all.</HI> He ro&s;e, therefore, betimes, and
going into the Cellar, re&s;tor'd the fifty Pieces to the Hole, he had taken
them from: The Blind Man went, af|terwards, and recover'd his Money, as he
expected, by the Succe&s;s of his Stratagem.</P> </Q>
<P>HERE, the <HI>Major</HI> clos'd his <HI>Speech</HI>; and it was
difficult to &s;ay, which had mo&s;t pleas'd the Hearers, His <HI>Story,</HI>
or his <HI>Good-Nature: Ned Volatile,</HI> him&s;elf, tho' his <HI>Vanity</HI>

Proverbially) to expre&s;s him&s;elf on this Occa&s;ion, 
<Q> 
<L>Et infidos agitans Di&s;cordia Fratres.</L></Q></P>
<P>IN the Beginning of the XVIth Century, the <HI>Portugueze</HI>
Carracks &s;ailed from <HI>Lisbon</HI> to <HI>Goa,</HI> a very great Colony of <HI>Portugueze,</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> The&s;e Carracks are the
large&s;t Ve&s;&s;els that pre&s;s the Ocean: On Board of one of them were
Twelve Hundred Souls, Mariners, Merchants, Pa&s;&s;engers, Prie&s;ts, and
Fryars, who were going on their &s;everal Mi&s;&s;ions e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in <HI>China</HI> and the <HI>Indies:</HI> The Begin|ning of their Voyage was
Pro&s;perous; they had doubled the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> and were
&s;teer|ing <HI>North-Ea&s;t</HI> to the Continent of <HI>India,</HI> when
&s;ome Gentlemen on Board, having &s;tudied <HI>Geo|graphy</HI> and <HI>Navigation,</HI> found in the Latitude in which they then were, a very
great Ridge of Rocks laid down in their Sea Charts; upon this, they apply'd
them&s;elves to the <HI>Captain</HI> <PB N="63" REF="72"> of the Ship, and
acquainted him with the Danger which they apprehended, de&s;iring him at the
&s;ame Time, to communicate what they had di&s;covered to the <HI>Pilot</HI>;
which Reque&s;t he immediately gratify'd, recommending to the <HI>Pilot</HI> to
lie by in the <HI>Night,</HI> and &s;lacken Sail by <HI>Day,</HI> 'till they
&s;hould be pa&s;t the Danger. By the Di&s;cipline of the <HI>Portugueze</HI>
Navy, the Sailing Part is ab&s;olutely committed to the Care of the <HI>Pilot,</HI> who is an&s;werable with his Head, for the &s;afe Carriage of
the King's Ship, and under no manner of Direction from the <HI>Captain,</HI>
who commands in all other Re&s;pects.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of complying with &s;o rea&s;onable a Reque&s;t, on which
the Safety of &s;o many Lives depended, the in&s;olent <HI>Pilot,</HI> thinking
it an Affront to be taught in his own Art, crowded more Sail than he carried
before.</P>
<P>THE Ob&s;ervations of the&s;e Gentlemen were too true, not to have
a fatal I&s;&s;ue: They had not &s;ailed many Hours, but ju&s;t upon Break of
Day, (which would have been prevented if they had lain by) the Ship &s;truck
upon a Rock, and broke her Back.</P>
<P>I LEAVE to the Reader's Imagination, what a Scene of Horror this
mu&s;t be; the Fright of Twelve hundred Per&s;ons in the &s;ame inevita|ble
Danger, at the Sight of that in&s;tantaneous Death, which &s;tar'd them in the
Face!</P>
<P>THE <HI>Captain</HI> in this Di&s;tre&s;s, order'd the Pinnace to
be launch'd, into which, after hav|ing to&s;s'd in a &s;mall Quantity of
Bi&s;cuit, and &s;ome few Boxes of Marmelade, he got him&s;elf 
<PB N="64" REF="73"> with nineteen others, who &s;eeing the Danger of a Crowd
in the common Horror, ru&s;hing in|to the Boat, drew their Swords and prevented
the coming in of any more: The &s;ame Nece&s;|&s;ity oblig'd them immediately
to put off, le&s;t their Pinnace &s;hould be drawn in by the Suction of the
&s;inking Carrack.</P>
<P>HERE their Eyes were entertain'd with the mo&s;t di&s;mal of
Spectacles, the Sight of their &s;inking Friends, and their Ears with the Cries
of &s;o many in the &s;ame Mi&s;ery, whom they could not help without their own
De&s;truction; a Scene of Woe, which nothing could alleviate but the
Reflection, that they them&s;elves were not in the &s;ame Extremity, though
humanly &s;peaking, they were not in a much better Con|dition, being
de&s;titute on the va&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean, in an open Boat, without any
Compa&s;s to direct them, without any fre&s;h Water, but what mu&s;t fall from
tho&s;e Heavens, who&s;e Mercy alone could deliver them. To which mu&s;t be
added, the inevitable Danger of being over&s;et by the fir&s;t Wind that
&s;hould rai&s;e the Waves, be&s;ides the Certainty of peri&s;hing a&s;&s;oon
as their &s;mall Stock of Provi&s;ions &s;hould be &s;pent, which only &s;erv'd
to prolong their Mi&s;eries by re&s;erving them for a more lingring and cruel
Death. In this Di&s;tre&s;s, after they had for four Days row|ed to and fro,
without Guide or Direction, the Captain, who had been &s;ick, and very weak,
for &s;ome Time, overcome with Grief and Fa|tigue, died. This added, if
po&s;&s;ible, to their Mi&s;ery, for now they fell into the la&s;t
Con|fu&s;ion, <PB N="65" REF="74"> Every one would Govern, and none would Obey:
This oblig'd them to chu&s;e one of their own Company to command them, who&s;e
Orders they agreed implicitly, without any Re&s;erve, to follow.</P>
<P>THE Choice fell upon a Gentleman, who was, what the <HI>Portugueze</HI> call a <HI>Me&s;tizzo,</HI> that is, one begotten between
an <HI>European</HI> and an <HI>Indian:</HI> This Per&s;on, ve&s;ted with his
new Authority, propo&s;ed to the Company to draw Lots, and throw every fourth
Man overboard, by Rea&s;on their Provi&s;ion was &s;pent &s;o far, as not to
la&s;t above three Days longer: They were now Nineteen Per&s;ons in all; in
this Number were a Fryar and the Carpenter, both whom, they would exempt, by
Rea&s;on of their being &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, the One to Ab|&s;olve and Comfort
them in their la&s;t Extremi|ty, and the other to take Care of the Boat, in
Ca&s;e of a Leak, or other Accident; the &s;ame Compliment they paid to their
new Captain, he being the odd Man, and his Life of more Con&s;equence than any
of the re&s;t. He refu|&s;ed a great while, but at la&s;t acquie&s;ced; &s;o
that there were four to dye out of the &s;ixteen remaining.</P>
<P>THE Three fir&s;t on whom the Lot fell, after having confe&s;s'd,
and receiv'd Ab&s;oluti|on, &s;ubmitted to their Fate.</P>
<P>THE Fourth, whom Fortune condemn'd, was a <HI>Portugueze</HI>
Gentleman who had a younger Brother in the Boat, who, &s;eeing him about to be
flung over-board, mo&s;t tenderly embraced <PB N="66" REF="75"> him, and with
Tears in his Eyes, be&s;ought him to let him dye for him; enforcing his
Ar|guments by telling him, That, <HI>He was a Mar|ried Man, and had a Wife and
Children at</HI> Goa, <HI>be&s;ides the Care of three Si&s;ters who
ab&s;olutely de|pended upon him: That as for him&s;elf, he was &s;ingle, and
his Life of no great Importance; he therefore conjur'd him to let him &s;upply
his Place.</HI></P>
<P>THE Elder Brother a&s;toni&s;h'd, and melted with this
Genero&s;ity, replied, That <HI>&s;ince the Providence of</HI> GOD, <HI>had
appointed him, it would be wicked and unju&s;t to &s;uffer any other to dye for
him, e&s;pecially a Brother to whom he was &s;o infinitely oblig'd.</HI></P>
<P>THE Younger would take no Denial, but flinging him&s;elf on his
Knees, held his Brother &s;o fa&s;t, that they could not di&s;engage them: Thus
they di&s;puted for a while, the Elder Bro|ther bidding him <HI>be a Father to
his Wife and Children, and as he would inherit his E&s;tate, take Care of their
common Si&s;ters</HI>; but all he could &s;ay, made him not de&s;i&s;t; This
was a Scene of Tenderne&s;s which mu&s;t fill with Pity any Brea&s;t
&s;u&s;ceptible of generous Impre&s;&s;ions!</P>
<P>AT la&s;t, as it is no difficult Thing to per|&s;uade a Man to
live, the <HI>Con&s;tancy</HI> of the Elder Brother yielded to the <HI>Piety</HI> of the Younger; he acquie&s;ced, and &s;uffered the Gallant
Young Man to &s;upply his Place; who being flung in|to the Water, when he came
to it, could not be content to dye; but being a very good Swimmer, got to the
Stern of the Pinnace, and <PB N="67" REF="76"> laid hold with his right Hand;
which being perceiv'd by one of the Sailors, he cut off the Hand with a
Cutla&s;s, upon which, dropping into the Sea, he caught hold again with his
Left, which received the &s;ame Fate by a &s;econd Blow; thus di&s;membered in
his two Hands, he made a &s;hift, notwith&s;tanding, to keep him|&s;elf above
Water, with his Feet and two Stumps.</P>
<P>THIS moving Spectacle &s;o rai&s;ed the Pity of the whole Crew,
that they cry'd out, <HI>He is but one Man, let us &s;ave him</HI>; which was
ac|cordingly done; and he taken into the Boat, had his Hands bound up as well
as the Place and Circum&s;tances would permit. They row'd all that Night, and
next Morning, when the Sun aro&s;e, as if Heaven would reward the Gal|lantry
and Piety of this Young Man, and for his Sake, &s;ave all the re&s;t, they
de&s;cry'd Land, which prov'd to be the Mountains of <HI>Mozam|bique</HI> in <HI>Africk,</HI> where the <HI>Portugueze</HI> have a Colony; hither they all
&s;afely got, where they &s;taid 'till the next Ships from <HI>Lisbon</HI>
pa&s;s'd by, and carried this Company to <HI>Goa</HI>; where <HI>Lin&s;chotten,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> Author of good Credit, a&s;&s;ures us,
That he him&s;elf &s;aw them land, &s;upp'd with the two Brothers that very
Night, &s;aw the Younger with his Stumps, and had the Story from both their
Mouths, as well as from the re&s;t of the Company.</P>

<P>MANY <HI>Lo&s;&s;es,</HI> that Year, had di&s;abled me to make

<P>He would willingly have &s;poke more; but could not &s;upport his <HI>Angui&s;h</HI>;&mdash;and wept again, very pa&s;&s;ionately; &s;o that

<P>I YESTERDAY went to &s;ee a very agree|able Friend, at who&s;e
Hou&s;e, I found a hand&s;ome Appearance of Young People of both SEXES. Upon my
Entrance, every one <PB N="78" REF="87"> ro&s;e, and very obligingly proffered
me a Seat, each in&s;i&s;ting on the Preference I &s;hould give in Acceptance
of the Honour de&s;ign'd me.</P>
<P>AS I was unwilling to di&s;oblige any One, where All had treated
me with &s;o much Civili|ty, I wink'd at my Friend, who, with great Formality,
conducted me to a large Elbow-Chair; and put an End to the Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>WHILE I was wondring with a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure, at &s;uch an <HI>unaccu&s;tom'd</HI> Piece of <HI>Good-breeding,</HI> and examining the
Countenances of the Com|pany, my Friend, who till then had di&s;cours'd of
indifferent Matters, told me with a Smile, <HI>He had a&s;&s;embled this Sett
of Young People, with a Promi&s;e of &s;hewing them the</HI> PLAIN DEALER, <HI>and therefore de&s;ir'd, I would throw</HI> a&s;ide <HI>all</HI>
Re|&s;ervedne&s;s, <HI>and look upon</HI> every one <HI>as my</HI> pro|fe&s;s'd
Admirer, <HI>and</HI> Friend, which was imme|diately confirm'd by a <HI>General
Reverence.</HI></P>
<P>I THANK'D him for the <HI>Favour</HI> he had done me, in
introducing me to &s;uch Agreeable Society; and could not help di&s;covering by
my Looks, the inward Satisfaction I felt, at the Sight of &s;o much <HI>Youth,</HI> and <HI>Beauty</HI>; which ended in that melancholy Reflection, <HI>How many</HI> Dangers <HI>it was</HI> expos'd <HI>to, and how ea&s;ily it
might be</HI> vitiated.</P>
<P>WHEN the Tea-Equipage was remov'd, and every One remained &s;ilent
in Expectation of what I &s;hould &s;ay, the Charming <HI>Leonilla,</HI> my
Friend's Elde&s;t Daughter, after having fir&s;t fix'd her Eyes on a Young Lady
that &s;at op|po&s;ite to her, and then on me, de&s;ir'd in Be|half 
<PB N="79" REF="88"> of Part of the Company, I would give my Opinion in the
Ca&s;e of <HI>That</HI> Re&s;triction <HI>Young Women lie under, who, from
a</HI> Cu&s;tom, <HI>which, in her Opinion, had no</HI> ju&s;t Grounds <HI>for
its Support, are</HI> forbid <HI>by</HI> Decency, <HI>let their</HI>
Pa&s;&s;ion <HI>be the mo&s;t</HI> vertuous <HI>and</HI> tender <HI>that was
ever felt, to make the lea&s;t</HI> Advance, <HI>by which the Party belov'd
may</HI> di&s;cover <HI>the</HI> Sen|timents <HI>they have in his Favour.</HI>
To which I an&s;wer'd, <HI>A Woman of Sen&s;e can never</HI> feel <HI>that</HI>
Tenderne&s;s <HI>for a</HI> Fool;&mdash;<HI>and a Man of</HI> Sen&s;e <HI>would
always reckon &s;uch a</HI> Declaration, <HI>a</HI> De&s;ire <HI>of</HI>
enjoying <HI>that</HI> Happine&s;s, <HI>who&s;e</HI> Ba&s;is <HI>is</HI> Love, <HI>and who&s;e</HI> Support <HI>is</HI> Virtue.</P>
<P>AFTER I had delivered my Opinion in Fa|vour of <HI>Leonilla,</HI>
I turn'd to the Lady, with whom (I could perceive by the Blu&s;h in her Cheeks)
&s;he had been di&s;puting, and told her, <HI>There was a</HI> fal&s;e, <HI>as
well as a</HI> true <HI>Decency; and that</HI> One <HI>con&s;i&s;ted in</HI>
Grimace <HI>and</HI> Shew, <HI>the</HI> Other <HI>in an</HI> open Deportment, <HI>the</HI> Re&s;ult <HI>of an unaffected, di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> Love <HI>of</HI> Virtue. <HI>And that it would always be found, a Man has no more
Rea&s;on to</HI> conceive Hopes <HI>from the</HI> free Con|ver&s;e <HI>of
the</HI> Latter, <HI>than to</HI> fear Succe&s;s <HI>from the</HI> di&s;tant
Carriage <HI>of the</HI> Former. True Vir|tue <HI>wants no Foil, and is never
talking of it&s;elf.</HI> Fal&s;e Virtue, <HI>&s;en&s;ible of its</HI>
Weakne&s;s, <HI>is forc'd to have Recour&s;e to</HI> Hypocri&s;y, <HI>and is
ever boa&s;ting a</HI> Strength <HI>it is a</HI> Stranger <HI>to.</HI></P>
<P>AS I was running on in this grave Di&s;|cour&s;e, I was
interrupted by a young Gentle|man, who told us, he had ju&s;t met with a Copy 
<PB N="80" REF="89"> of VERSES, &s;aid to be written by Lady <HI>W&mdash;y

<P>ONE Evening, very lately, All my Neigh|bourhood, in <HI>Barbican,</HI> were in an Uproar, on a &s;udden; and I was di&s;turb'd, in
my Medi|tations, by the &s;hrieking of Women, the mix'd Cries of Children, and
a growing <HI>Hum</HI> of Con|cour&s;e, that &s;eem'd clo&s;e under my
Window.&mdash;I threw a&s;ide my Pipe; and, ha&s;tening to look out, &s;aw the
Street entirely fill'd, by a <HI>Groupe</HI> of di&s;mal Faces; that had
gather'd them&s;elves into a Tumult, about a Hou&s;e, directly oppo&s;ite, and
appear'd to be touch'd, as &s;trongly as Common Natures are capable, with a
Mixture of <HI>Surprize</HI> and <HI>Sorrow.</HI> It &s;eems, the Husband of a
laborious, poor Crea|ture, <PB N="86" REF="95"> who was Mi&s;tre&s;s of this
Hou&s;e, had been condemn'd, at the County A&s;&s;izes, in one of the late
Circuits, for &s;tealing a Hor&s;e: And a Letter had, ju&s;t now, been
deliver'd to his Wife; which the Criminal him&s;elf had writ|ten, the very
Morning he was executed.</P>
<P>HIS Relations and Acquaintance had de|pended on a <HI>Reprieve</HI>; for the Man was uni|ver&s;ally belov'd among his Neighbours:
And, tho' always very poor, and unfortunate in his Dealings, had been
remarkable for his Indu&s;try; of a &s;ober Di&s;po&s;ition, and never known,
be|fore, to have been guilty of the lea&s;t Di&s;ho|ne&s;ty. He had Six
Children alive, and the Elde&s;t but Eight Years old. His Mother, who liv'd in
the &s;ame little Hou&s;e, had been di&s;abled, by Sickne&s;s, for &s;everal
Months pa&s;t: So that, perceiving it beyond his Power to &s;ub&s;i&s;t his
Family any longer, and not daring to &s;tay in Town, by Rea&s;on of &s;ome
Debts he had contracted, he went down, to <HI>try his Friends,</HI> who liv'd,
in good Circum&s;tances, in the Country. But, in&s;tead of meeting with <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tance,</HI> he only &s;pent, in this Journey, all the little he
had carried with him: And not being able to &s;upport the Thoughts of
return|ing, <HI>without Bread,</HI> to a Family, in &s;uch want of it, he rode
away with a Hor&s;e, which he found ty'd to a Gate; and being pur&s;u'd, and
overtaken, was try'd, condemn'd, and hang'd, for it.</P>
<P>THIS Hi&s;tory was loudly given me, by the good Women, in the
Street; after which, <PB N="87" REF="96"> I had the Curio&s;ity to pre&s;s in,
among the Crowd; and was &s;truck, at my fir&s;t Entrance, by the mo&s;t <HI>moving</HI> Scene of <HI>Sorrow,</HI> that I ever remember to have met
with. The Wi|dow had broke open her Husband's Letter, in Tran&s;port,
concluding, That it brought her the Confirmation of a <HI>Reprieve,</HI> which
a former had given her Hopes of. But &s;he was &s;o &s;hock'd, and overwhelm'd
by the &s;udden Rever&s;e of Pa&s;|&s;ion, that her Grief was a kind of <HI>Madne&s;s.</HI> She &s;at on the Floor without Headcloaths; and had an
Infant, cro&s;s her Knees, that was crying, with great Impatience, for the <HI>Brea&s;t,</HI> it had been thrown from. Another <HI>&s;lept</HI> in a <HI>Cradle,</HI> clo&s;e by a little <HI>Bed,</HI> in which the <HI>Grandmother</HI> &s;at weeping; bending forward in &s;trong Agony; and
wringing her Hands in &s;ilence. The Four Elde&s;t Children were gather'd into
a Knot, and clung about the Neck of their mi&s;erable Mother: <HI>&s;tamping,
&s;creaming,</HI> and <HI>ki&s;&s;ing her,</HI> in a Storm of di&s;tracted <HI>Tenderne&s;s!</HI>&mdash;The poor Woman, <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> was in a

had been pre&s;ent!&mdash;And, at every little Interval, dry'd her <HI>Tears,</HI> with his <HI>Letter:</HI> And ca&s;t a Look upon the Com|pany,
&s;o <HI>wild!</HI> and &s;o full of <HI>Horror!</HI> that it cannot be

her Hand; and made Signs, that I &s;hould read <PB N="88" REF="97"> the Letter;

<SALUTE>Dear, Loving <HI>Betty,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now nine a Clock; and I mu&s;t be fetch'd out, by and by,
and go to die, before Eleven. I &s;hall &s;ee my poor <HI>Be&s;s</HI> no more,
in this World; but, if we meet one another again in the next, as I hope in God
we &s;hall, we may never part after|wards. Methinks, if I cou'd but only once

a Minute; and &s;ay a kind Word to my Fatherle&s;s Children, that mu&s;t <HI>Starve now,</HI> if God don't take Care for them, I &s;hould go, away, with

it wou'd be <HI>&s;ad,</HI> to die, afterwards, and I fear it wou'd make me
faint|hearted: and I &s;hould be wi&s;hing, that I might live, to get you <HI>Bread,</HI> and Cloaths, for your poor precious Bodies. <HI>Sarah
Taylor</HI> made my Heart ake, when &s;he told me, that you had pawn'd away,

&s;hould hit <PB N="89" REF="98"> it in your Teeth, that I come to &s;uch an

they had no Bread, to keep Life in 'em; and begging me to buy them &s;ome. And
&s;o, I thought that I would &s;ell that <HI>Hor&s;e,</HI> and make you
be|lieve, that I got Money, of your <HI>Si&s;ter Parker:</HI> But &s;he was too <HI>Sparing,</HI> for <HI>that;</HI> and wou'd never once look upon me.&mdash;I
pray to God to forgive her, and, if &s;he wou'd but be Good to <HI>you,</HI>
when I am gone, God ble&s;s her.&mdash;<HI>Loving Betty,</HI> remember me to my
&s;orrowful Mother, and tell her not to <HI>take on</HI> too much. And bid <HI>Richard</HI> and <HI>Harry,</HI> take Warning by <HI>my Fall,</HI> if ever
they come to be <HI>Men:</HI> And, for the poor Girls, they are too young, as
yet, to under&s;tand any thing you can &s;ay to them. God's Goodne&s;s be your
Comfort, and if you can, don't <HI>think</HI> about <HI>me,</HI> for it will
make you only melancholly.&mdash;I hope, the Old <HI>Deputy</HI> will be kind
to you, and help you to do &s;omewhat. I am &s;orry I can't write no more,
becau&s;e my Tears are come into my Eyes.&mdash;Little did I think of this <HI>di&s;mal Parting</HI>&mdash;Oh! 'tis very &s;ad!&mdash;God ble&s;s you, in

it was univer&s;ally Agreed, That there is a plain-hearted Hone&s;ty, very

&s;o much from his own De&s;ire to <HI>Live,</HI> as from a Pro&s;pect of <HI>their Wants,</HI> whom his Death was to leave <HI>De&s;titute.</HI> Our

Chari|table Collection, to be &s;ent to the poor <HI>Widow,</HI> to which
him&s;elf contributed <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> in a very liberal Proportion.</P>
<P>He related to us afterwards an extraordinary <HI>Dying

a <HI>Robbery.</HI></P>
<Q><HI>GOOD People, &s;aid the Criminal,</HI> &s;ince I am to &s;erve
you, for a <HI>Sight,</HI> the lea&s;t you can do, is to be <HI>Civil</HI> to

that is due to me. There are &s;ome medling Tongues, <PB N="91" REF="100">
which I can hear among the Crowd, very bu&s;y to incen&s;e you. Tho' it is
true, I have <HI>committed Murder,</HI> yet I hope I am <HI>no Murderer.</HI>
The <HI>Felony</HI> I really purpos'd; but my <HI>Intention</HI> had no part in
the <HI>Death</HI> that I was Guilty of. The Deceas'd cry'd for Help, and was
&s;o Ob&s;tinate, and Clamorous, that I was under a Nece&s;&s;ity to <HI>kill</HI> him; or &s;ubmit my &s;elf to be taken. And thus I argued in my
Mind. If I <HI>Murder</HI> him, I &s;hall <HI>get off;</HI> or, at wor&s;t, if
I am taken, my Puni&s;hment will be <HI>no greater,</HI> than if I &s;pare him,

mu&s;t be <HI>HANG'D TOO,</HI> for the <HI>Hou&s;e-breaking!</HI> This Thought,
Good People, prevail'd with me to <HI>Shoot</HI> him; &s;o that what <HI>you</HI> call <HI>Murder,</HI> was but <HI>Self-Pre&s;ervation.</HI> Now

<P>THERE are in every Man's Life, even the wi&s;e&s;t, and mo&s;t
fortified, certain <HI>Periods</HI> of <HI>Weakne&s;s,</HI> which demon&s;trate
our common Frailty, and &s;eem thrown into our Nature, as Pre&s;ervatives
again&s;t <HI>Pride</HI>; and for the Mortification of Human Vanity.</P>
<P>THAT Venerable <HI>Sage</HI> of old, who has left us this <HI>Aphori&s;m, That no Man &s;hould be e&s;teem'd happy, 'till after his
Death;</HI> might have extend|ed his Ob&s;ervation, as well to our <HI>Conduct,</HI> as our <HI>Fortune: Let no Man, during Life, be call'd
Re&s;olute, or Prudent.</HI></P>
<P>COULD I ever have thought, That after pa&s;&s;ing my giddy <HI>Youth</HI> in a &s;teddy Contempt of Beauty, I &s;hould be en&s;lav'd to
it, <HI>again&s;t Judgment,</HI> in my Grand <HI>Climacterick!</HI> If the Duty
of a PLAIN DEALER did not indi&s;pen|&s;ibly oblige me to the mo&s;t rigid
Impartiality; <PB N="94" REF="103"> even to the giving Sentence again&s;t <HI>my-&s;elf,</HI> with what Face cou'd I confe&s;s, (what I am a&s;ham'd,
when I but think of) That I, who am a <HI>&s;taid Old Batchelor,</HI> am
afraid, I am fall|ing in <HI>Love</HI> with <HI>Patty Amble</HI> the <HI>Coquet!</HI> who always &s;eem'd to me, to have been <HI>born</HI> in a Fit
of <HI>Laughter!</HI> and never had a <HI>Thought</HI> of <HI>Gravity,</HI> but
when it furni&s;h'd her with an Oc|ca&s;ion to divert her&s;elf at the Expence
of it!</P>
<P>WELL! If this &s;hould, in good Earne&s;t, come to pa&s;s, I
&s;hall have a mo&s;t uncomforta|ble Time of it! What Rea&s;on I have had, and
from what Time, to &s;u&s;pect it, I &s;hall, without Re&s;erve, communicate,
in the Progre&s;s of my PAPERS. But let it prove what it will, the Occa&s;ion
of this Preamble is from an un|u&s;ual Di&s;order, in which I am come Home this
Evening, after a kind of frolick&s;ome Ad|venture, with that young <HI>Romp</HI>; which has left me under an Impre&s;&s;ion, little better than <HI>Witchcraft</HI>; tho' at any Time before <HI>la&s;t Ea&s;ter,</HI> I
&s;hould have thought it <HI>not worth telling.</HI></P>
<P>TO Day, when &s;he <HI>hoyden'd</HI> into the A&s;|&s;embly, the
whole Company ro&s;e together, and received her with that Plea&s;ure, which her <HI>Gayety</HI> diffu&s;es every where. She &s;ailed through us all, with a <HI>&s;wimming, &s;miling Port,</HI> that was vi&s;ibly <HI>affected,</HI> but
irre&s;i&s;tably enga|ging!&mdash;When &s;he had flutter'd, and fidget|ed, and
&s;loped her &s;elf forward, and wheel'd down her Hoop, to the wide&s;t Swell
of its <HI>Convex,</HI> in a Circular Cour&s;e of <HI>Curte&s;ies</HI>; &s;he
tript &s;ideways to her Seat; and I was ju&s;t be|ginning <PB N="95" REF="104">
to hope <HI>Calm Weather,</HI> after &s;uch a <HI>Whirl-wind</HI> of <HI>Ceremony!</HI> when &s;he ro&s;e, as it were in a <HI>Start,</HI> with a
Look mo&s;t <HI>whim&s;ical|ly Serious</HI>; and drawing a Paper from her
Bo|&s;om, pac'd demurely to <HI>my Chair</HI>&mdash;She carry'd her Head to the
left &s;ide, &s;oftly &s;weep|ing her right Eye-Brow, with the <HI>Knob</HI> of
her <HI>Fan,</HI> and &s;inking forward, when &s;he came near me, with a
Fanta&s;tical Air of Langui&s;hment, bru&s;h'd my Mouth with her Paper; and
be|gan to play over her Tricks, in a long and my&s;tical <HI>Jargon</HI> of <HI>mo&s;t Womani&s;h Impertinence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AND were they,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>&s;o naughty, to leave
it by it's nown &s;elf? And did no body help it to write it's</HI>
PLAIN-DEALERS? <HI>and was it abus'd, and over-work'd and neglected? Well then,
let it be Good, and mind it's Book, and wa&s;h it's Face, and forget to be
cro&s;s, and comb it's Head, and throw away it's dirty Stick; and &s;ee what I
intend to do for it! There take it, and Print it; And, don't care a Pin for the
Work they have put upon it. For I love it, and will think for it; and bring it
good Things. And if it wou'dn't look Grim, I &s;hould bu&s;s it, and &s;troak
it, and chuck it under the Chin; and make much of it, and play with it,
and</HI>&mdash;&amp;c.&mdash;&amp;c.&mdash;&amp;c.&mdash;</P>
<P>AFTER this &s;illy Rate, &s;he ran on, with a ridiculous, but
lively and never-ending Volu|bility: and perceiving, that the Company laugh'd
out, and were diverted at the grote&s;que Figure I was making under her Hand's,
at length &s;he ki&s;s'd me out-right, and &s;et 'em all, <PB N="96" REF="105">
in an <HI>Uproar.</HI> I wou'd fain have look'd peevi&s;h. I turn'd my Face
from her, and cry'd <HI>Pi&s;h</HI>&mdash;and <HI>P&s;haw</HI>&mdash;and <HI>Fiddle</HI>&mdash;and &s;hook my Head in a great Heat, and winch'd in both
Shoulders; and much Pains I took, to &s;eem nettled, and unea&s;y. But, to
confe&s;s a fooli&s;h Truth, it was all, but <HI>mere Show</HI>; for I was
never &s;o agreeably made an A&s;s of in my Life, and while I felt the bu&s;y
Wanderings of her Fingers about my Face, I was &s;tung I can't tell how, with a
Kind of tingling Delight, all over me; which being de&s;irous to prolong, I
pretended to make Efforts for pu&s;hing her away; and under that Pretence, gave
my Hands the Opportunity of <HI>touching</HI> her, here and there&mdash;And I
mu&s;t own, I was &s;orry when &s;he put an End to her <HI>Gambols.</HI></P>
<P>BUT as &s;oon as I came home, and look'd into her Paper, I was not
&s;o much an <HI>A&s;s,</HI> (far gone as I found My-&s;elf) but that I
pre|&s;ently di&s;cern'd her <HI>Drift:</HI> And I wi&s;h, with all my Heart,
that I had Courage enough to return it her; and tell her, in downright Terms, <HI>I don't think it worth Printing.</HI> But whatever the Cau&s;e of this
&s;trange Alteration may be, there is nothing &s;o dreadful to me, as the
Dan|ger of di&s;obliging this <HI>She-Cockatrice!</HI> Since therefore, I am in
this odd Manner, <HI>bewitch'd,</HI> e'en take it, in the <HI>arch Flirt's</HI>
own Words: For it is no Work of mine; and I will have nothing to do with
it.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>LADIES</HI> Equivalent. <HI>A TALE,</HI> with a <HI>MORAL</HI> to It.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Reign of the Emperor <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> the City
of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> was much throng'd with <HI>Foreigners</HI>; for
who&s;e Entertainment, <HI>unu&s;ual Pa&s;times</HI> were invented. The Publick
Theatres were embelli&s;h'd, interlarded and embroider'd, with <HI>Mu&s;ick,
Magick</HI> and <HI>Tumbling</HI>; and &s;uch <HI>un&s;peakable</HI> Additions,
as were fitte&s;t to give Plea&s;ure to the <HI>Eyes</HI> of <HI>Goths,
Vandals,</HI> and <HI>Saracens,</HI> to whom <HI>Plays, alone,</HI> were
in&s;ipid, becau&s;e acted in a Language, which they were, in a Manner, wholly
Strangers to.</P>
<P><HI>THEODORA,</HI> the Empre&s;s, had been formerly a <HI>Comedian,</HI> and was a liberal Pro|moter of whatever cou'd contribute to
make Plea&s;ure pompous. Among the Numbers, who found their Intere&s;t in this <HI>Byas</HI> of the <HI>Court,</HI> there was a wily and egregious <HI>African</HI>; whom for the Flatne&s;s of his No&s;e, the Tawnine&s;s of his
Complexion, and a certain <HI>Maje&s;tical Bru|tality,</HI> in the
Compo&s;ition of his Features, the merry <HI>Greeks</HI> had nicknamed the <HI>LYON.</HI> This Man became rich, by the univer&s;al Encouragement, that was
given to an odd Project, of his &s;tarting.&mdash;It was a Kind of <HI>Blind-Buzzard,</HI> or <HI>Midnight-Mummery</HI>; of which it is difficult,
at this great Di&s;tance of Time, to conceive a clear Notion: But Per|&s;ons of
the highe&s;t Rank, of both Sexes, met there, di&s;guis'd, and under borrow'd
Re&s;em|blances, <PB N="98" REF="107"> danc'd, regal'd, and di&s;cours'd with
each other, at large, and di&s;engag'd from all <HI>Ceremony,
Di&s;tinction,</HI> or <HI>Punctilio.</HI></P>
<P>IT was generally allow'd, however, by all but the <HI>LYON</HI>'s Enemies, that nothing pa&s;s'd in the&s;e Meetings, either
Scandalous or Misbe|coming: Every thing was Magnificent, Orna|mental, and
Enlivening: But no <HI>Privacies</HI> were permitted, nor <HI>Indecencies</HI>
connived at.</P>
<P>IT fell out, notwith&s;tanding, mo&s;t unfor|tunately for
the <HI>LYON,</HI> That <HI>Religion</HI> was at this Time very flaming, and
watchful. The <HI>Good Fathers</HI> of the Church became &s;candalized, and
alarm'd, at the Probability of <HI>Impurities,</HI> in this new-invented <HI>Nightwork:</HI> For, it was dangerous, they knew, to allow &s;uch Latitude
to their <HI>Female Flock,</HI> while their Shepherds were at Re&s;t, who kept
the <HI>Wolf</HI> from <HI>biting</HI> them. They determine, therefore,
vigorou&s;ly to <HI>remon&s;trate</HI> again&s;t it. But there was One
con&s;iderable <HI>Rub,</HI> that lay full in their Way. The <HI>Emperor
him&s;elf</HI> was often pre&s;ent at the&s;e Meetings, and indulg'd them, as
an innocent, and agreeable Recreation.</P>
<P>TO Remove this heavy <HI>Difficulty,</HI> the <HI>Good
Fathers,</HI> with great <HI>Dexterity,</HI> charg'd the Mo|tive of their <HI>Fears,</HI> upon the <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Women,</HI> who&s;e
Natures, they &s;aid, were liable to very dangerous <HI>Impre&s;&s;ions,</HI>
from tho&s;e Whi&s;per|ings, and Squeezings, and Inflammations of their <HI>Vanity.</HI> They went on to a&s;&s;ert, That a <HI>Woman</HI>'s Defence
again&s;t <HI>Man,</HI> lying rather in her Dread of <HI>Shame,</HI> than her
Abhorrence of <HI>Iniquity,</HI> <PB N="99" REF="108"> &s;he &s;hou'd never be
thought <HI>Safe,</HI> while under the Hazard of <HI>Temptations.</HI> The <HI>Men</HI> indeed, <HI>they believ'd,</HI> might be <HI>&s;trong</HI> enough
to <HI>re&s;i&s;t</HI>; but not their <HI>Wives,</HI> and their <HI>Daughters:</HI> Weak Ve&s;&s;els! and brittle! and which wou'd <HI>break</HI> with a <HI>Fall!</HI> It were Prudence therefore, to place them
out of the <HI>publick Reach,</HI> and <HI>cupboard</HI> them up, for the
Hou&s;hold U&s;e of their <HI>Owners:</HI> So they humbly repre&s;ented, That
it wou'd be an Act of great <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>E|dification,</HI> if his
Imperial Maje&s;ty gave Com|mand for the Total <HI>Suppre&s;&s;ion</HI> of
the&s;e New <HI>Nur&s;eries</HI> of <HI>Debauchery.</HI></P>
<P>IT is one Thing to be <HI>Pious,</HI> and another to be <HI>Wi&s;e.</HI> The Warmth of their <HI>Zeal</HI> had not &s;uffer'd them to
con&s;ider, That there were <HI>Women</HI> of <HI>Wit,</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> who would vindi|cate their <HI>Sex's Honour</HI>; and make
u&s;e of their powerful <HI>Influence,</HI> to oppo&s;e the good <HI>End</HI>
of the&s;e Reverend Memoriali&s;ts, were it for no other Rea&s;on but becau&s;e
the Means were un|mannerly. <HI>THEODORA,</HI> the Empre&s;s, was provok'd to
the la&s;t Degree; and after reproach|ing their <HI>Partiality,</HI> and the
mean and fal&s;e <HI>Idea's,</HI> which they had conceiv'd, of <HI>Womens
Virtue,</HI> fell to rea&s;on with them in this Manner.</P>
<Q>HOW Contemptibly wou'd your <HI>Sex</HI> com|pel us to
con&s;ider them, if all <HI>Men</HI> were to treat us with &s;o ungenerous a <HI>Diffidence!</HI> Is it po&s;&s;ible, think ye, That our <HI>Per&s;ons</HI>
can be won, before our <HI>Hearts</HI> have di&s;pos'd of 'em? And, whenever we <HI>Love pa&s;&s;ionately,</HI> we have Courage to <HI>Act re&s;olutely</HI>;
and <HI>make</HI> <PB N="100" REF="109"> Opportunities, if we were not allow'd
to <HI>find</HI> 'em. If you once confine our <HI>Bodies,</HI> you &s;et our <HI>Minds</HI> at full Liberty. Our <HI>Natures</HI> are too generous, to <HI>deceive</HI> tho&s;e who <HI>tru&s;t</HI> us. But we think it a <HI>Merit,</HI> to make <HI>Fools</HI> of the <HI>Faithle&s;s.</HI></Q>
<P>THE <HI>LYON,</HI> grinning horribly, behind the
Empre&s;s's Chair, was ready to <HI>roar,</HI> with De|light, at this Rebuke to
the Fathers. But, &s;tedfa&s;t, and immoveable, in the <HI>Piety</HI> of their <HI>Purpo&s;e,</HI> they were about to Reply at Large: When the Emperor, who
had <HI>Meanings</HI> not to be trac'd on his <HI>Countenance,</HI> concealing
his Re&s;entment, return'd this <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to their <HI>Re|mon&s;trance.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<P> I Thank you, for this <HI>Religious Simplicity,</HI> of
your Proceeding. You are the <HI>Eyes</HI> of our <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> and <HI>&s;ee farther</HI> than we can. But I am not more pleas'd with your
apply|ing for <HI>Redre&s;s</HI> of this <HI>formidable Grievance,</HI> than
&s;urpriz'd, at your <HI>overlooking</HI> another, of like Tendency; and which
your <HI>laudable Zeal,</HI> for <HI>Removing Temptations,</HI> mu&s;t excite
you, to thank me, for re&s;olving to &s;ee re|medy'd.</P> 
<P> THE <HI>Women</HI> have a <HI>Cu&s;tom,</HI> when they
&s;tand in need of <HI>Ab&s;olution,</HI> to <HI>&s;end for</HI> their
Confe&s;&s;or, and open their Hearts to him, in their <HI>Clo&s;ets.</HI> Were

this cou'd po&s;&s;ibly admini&s;ter no ju&s;t Cau&s;e of <HI>Scandal:</HI>
But, &s;ince <HI>Nature</HI> is <HI>deprav'd,</HI> and there have been <HI>Wolves, in Sheep's Cloathing,</HI> I conceive <PB N="101" REF="110"> it a
De&s;ign, of <HI>much Edification,</HI> to aboli&s;h, for the future, this <HI>Indulgence</HI> of the <HI>Women</HI>; and withhold their <HI>Ab&s;olution,</HI> 'till they come for it, to the <HI>Churches.</HI>
Intending therefore to join the&s;e <HI>good Purpo&s;es</HI> in <HI>One,</HI> I
commit it to your Care, to prepare an <HI>Edict,</HI> for <HI>Both,</HI> that I
may decree it into <HI>Law,</HI> with as much &s;peed, as po&s;&s;ible.</P></Q>
<P>THE <HI>Good Fathers</HI> were, &s;o unexpectedly, and beyond
mea&s;ure, <HI>confounded,</HI> at this over-liberal <HI>Extent</HI> of the
Emperor's <HI>pious Purpo&s;e,</HI> that they &s;tood long, at a Lo&s;s, to
find fit Words to thank him. But they did it at la&s;t, with this <HI>Hope,</HI> in the <HI>Rear</HI> of <HI>all</HI>;&mdash;That his High and
Imperial Maje&s;ty <HI>wou'd not ha&s;ten them too much, in Two Decrees of
&s;uch Impor|tance, &s;ince the Empre&s;s had urg'd &s;ome Argu|ments, to prove

more clo&s;ely, but they might be mi&s;taken, in Both of 'em?</HI></P>

<P>LITTLE Follies, which we but Smile at in Per&s;ons who are Indifferent
to us, gives us Sorrow and Pain, when ob&s;erv'd in tho&s;e we Love. <HI>Patty
Amble</HI> is of late become of &s;uch Importance, that I watch her with a
Tenderne&s;s, that intere&s;ts me in all her Acti|ons. For this Rea&s;on, I am
frequently con|triving to interrupt Her, when &s;he lets her Tongue run Races,
that out-gallop her Rea|&s;on. But I always lo&s;e my Labour: My Operations
upon this <HI>Go&s;&s;ip</HI> are like the <HI>Wind's</HI> upon <HI>Fire</HI>;
I may blow till my Breath fails,&mdash;in&s;tead of <HI>putting her out,</HI> I
make her <HI>burn</HI> but the <HI>fa&s;ter!</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE &s;ucceeded however, in what I fail'd to do <HI>My-&s;elf,</HI>
by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Ned Volatile,</HI> But not to a&s;&s;ume more
Triumph than is due to me, the Stratagem I made u&s;e of, was found out by <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> before me. That Poetical Politican taught his <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, among the re&s;t of his &s;urprizing Victories, to

<P>WE &s;hall now enjoy &s;ome Freedom, and may all Talk in our Turns;
for <HI>Ned,</HI> and the <HI>Coquet,</HI> will be play'd off at Plea&s;ure.
When either of 'em grows Trouble&s;ome, we &s;hall let loo&s;e the <HI>Rival,</HI> and like <HI>Sulphur</HI> and <HI>Salt-Petre,</HI> one &s;hall

<P><HI>PATTY AMBLE</HI> came Ye&s;terday fine|ly dre&s;s'd to the <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI>; ready to bur&s;t with Impatience for our Admiration of

Varieties. From her Head to her Foot, &s;he oblig'd us with the Minutes of her
whole Fortnight's Hi&s;tory. It was not to be expected, that in the mid&s;t of
&s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he cou'd be at Lei&s;ure to con&s;ider, That after
we had approv'd both the Price, and Colour of her <HI>Damask,</HI> it was of no
great Edification, at lea&s;t to the <HI>Male</HI> Part of the Company, to know
what <HI>Shop</HI> &s;he bought it at. But happy had it been cou'd &s;he have

Part, I <HI>mu&s;t &s;ay,</HI> I was particularly <HI>edify'd</HI> by her
cri|tical Remarks, on certain Differences to be found, betwixt buying on <HI>Ludgate-Hill,</HI> or of the Mercers about <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="113">BUT ill fare, &s;ay I, that unlucky Word <HI>Garden!</HI> It put her fatally in Mind of a Fat fre&s;h-colour'd <HI>Country Lady,</HI> who cou'd never be per&s;uaded to make Vi&s;its, in any
thing but <HI>Garden Silks,</HI> tho' her Arms were as big as a <HI>Rolling-Stone!</HI> Then the unfortunate Word <HI>Fat,</HI> brought as

that us'd to Work for her <HI>Grandmother,</HI> when fir&s;t &s;he was Married!
and never <HI>lac'd</HI> our <HI>Patty,</HI> when &s;he was a Girl, but &s;he
made her <HI>very Neck ake</HI> with twi&s;ting it to look back at him. At
length, after infinite Di&s;appointments and Dangers, &s;he arriv'd &s;afe at

<P>COULD I execute this <HI>De&s;ign</HI> according to my <HI>Wi&s;h</HI>; could I make the <HI>Draught</HI> ju&s;t, and give it the <HI>Lively Touches</HI> and <HI>warm Colours</HI> it de&s;erves, it might

Piece,</HI> for the mar|ried Part of my <HI>Readers,</HI> and &s;ome of their

for all your <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> to ac|count for it. You will find your&s;elf

with a <HI>Patron</HI> in it, to give him a <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> of its <HI>Enjoyments.</HI> Whoever may be meant by <HI>HORATIUS,</HI> if he makes as

<P>THERE is a <HI>Scantine&s;s,</HI> in &s;ome Mens Souls, that gives a
di&s;ta&s;teful Air to their very Favours, and their Prai&s;es; what the <HI>Mien</HI> is to the Body, the <HI>Temper</HI> is to the Mind. And for Want
of this Ob&s;ervation, on Occa&s;i|ons where it had been mo&s;t u&s;eful,
&s;ome have lo&s;t their Friends Good-will by an arrogant Manner of <HI>obliging</HI> them; and others <HI>prais'd</HI> Men into a <HI>Contempt</HI> both for their Per&s;ons and their Civilities.</P>
<P>THERE mu&s;t be vi&s;ible, in tho&s;e, who wou'd &s;ay, or do, Things
engagingly, a certain Sweet|ne&s;s in the Eye, and a Sen&s;e of Plea&s;ure in
the Deportment. A Compliment is an <HI>Affront,</HI> when accompany'd with a
&s;ullen Brow, or a negligent, an ab&s;ent, or &s;upercilious, Behaviour. I
appeal to my Readers, Whether they do not <PB N="118" REF="127"> always find
them&s;elves unea&s;y in the Company of a Per&s;on, who &s;eems more pleas'd
with <HI>Him|&s;elf,</HI> than with tho&s;e he is conver&s;ing with.</P>
<P>I WAS drawn into this Reflection, by read|ing, the other Day, a little
Copy of VERSES, which is printed, with &s;ome Poetical Pieces of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s, and was written by a Per&s;on of very great Quality, and
who&s;e <HI>Wit, too,</HI> was of the fir&s;t Mangnitude!</P>
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>On Mr. POPE, and his POEMS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WITH Age decay'd, with Courts and Bu&s;ine&s;s tir'd,</L>
<L>Caring for nothing, but what Ea&s;e requir'd;</L>
<L>Too dully Serious for the <HI>Mu&s;es</HI> Sport,</L>
<L>And, from the Critics, &s;afe arriv'd in Port:</L>
<L>I little thought of launching forth agen,</L>
<L>Amid&s;t advent'rous Rovers of the Pen:</L>
<L>And, after &s;o much unde&s;erv'd Succe&s;s,</L>
<L>Thus hazarding at la&s;t, to make it le&s;s.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Encomiums</HI> &s;uit not this cen&s;orious Time,</L>

<L><HI>Ignorance</HI> honour'd, <HI>Wit,</HI> and <HI>Worth</HI>
defam'd,</L>
<L><HI>Folly</HI> triumphant, and ev'n <HI>HOMER</HI> blam'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But to this Genius, join'd with &s;o much Art,</L>
<L>Such various Learning, mix'd, in every Part,</L>
<L>Poets are bound a loud Applau&s;e to pay;</L>
<L><HI>APOLLO</HI> bids it, and they mu&s;t obey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And, yet, &s;o wonderful, &s;ublime, a Thing,</L>
<L>As the great <HI>Iliad,</HI> &s;carce &s;hou'd make <HI>Me</HI>
&s;ing:</L>
<L>Except I ju&s;tly cou'd, at once commend,</L>
<L>A good Companion, and as firm a Friend.</L>
<L><PB N="119" REF="128">One moral, or a mere well-natur'd

<L>Does all De&s;ert in Sciences exceed.</L>
<L>'Tis great Delight to laugh at &s;ome Mens Ways,</L>
<L>But a much greater, to give Merit <HI>Prai&s;e.</HI></L>
</LG>
</LG></Q>
<P>THE good Nature of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> mu&s;t be as Exten&s;ive, as his
Wit, if his E&s;teem for this <HI>Noble</HI> Author was not le&s;&s;en'd, by
&s;o <HI>Ignoble</HI> a Start of his Poetry. It is a grudging, haugh|ty,
con&s;cious, reluctant, and penurious En|comium! Under Pretence of Prai&s;e to
a Friend, it indulges Spleen to his Enemies. It carries, throughout, a clo&s;er
Eye upon <HI>his own</HI> Merit, than upon <HI>His</HI> to whom he
addre&s;&s;es it. In four and twenty Ver&s;es, the four odd ones, I <HI>think,</HI> have &s;ome faint Inclination to &s;hew Re|&s;pect to <HI>another</HI>; but the twenty, <HI>I am &s;ure,</HI> with a much &s;tronger
Bent, point directly up|on <HI>Him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>WOULD this great Man have applauded &s;uch a POET, as he ought, he
&s;hou'd have forgotten, or &s;eem'd to forget, both <HI>Him&s;elf,</HI> and
his <HI>Rank,</HI> in that Reverence, &s;o ju&s;tly due to an Excellence, which
will do Honour to our Nation. He &s;hou'd not have imagin'd him&s;elf over
Bountiful in his Conde&s;cention: The Prai&s;e of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> will be a
Theme for Wit, and Learning, when all the <HI>Dukes,</HI> his <HI>Patrons,</HI>
&s;hall be <HI>lo&s;t</HI> in the Du&s;t that covers them! The accidental
Advantages of Birth, Wealth, and Title, are &s;o far from be&s;towing Worth,
where they find it not originally, that they &s;erve but to make the Want of it
more <PB N="120" REF="129"> obvious and contemptible; whereas a <HI>Genius</HI>
like this Gentleman's, &s;urmounts all the &s;ha|dowy Superiorities of Fortune,
adorns Dignity it&s;elf, and makes Ob&s;curity illu&s;trious!</P>
<P>THE great <HI>Cardinal Richelieu,</HI> in a Circum|&s;tance of like
Nature, acted in &s;o different a Manner, that I am always charm'd afre&s;h,
when I read over a Letter, which he &s;ent to <HI>Balzac</HI> a <HI>French</HI>
Writer, who&s;e Merit was as inferior to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s, as the Grandeur
of the <HI>Prime Mini&s;ter</HI> was &s;uperior to the <HI>Nobleman</HI>'s: Let
a Judgment be drawn, from an impartial Compari&s;on.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' I have often, and openly, declar'd what I think of your
Writings, yet can|not I &s;atisfy my &s;elf without &s;ending you, by this
Letter, a more <HI>Authentic</HI> Approba|tion: I never had any particular
Affection for your Per&s;on, and &s;ince, therefore, it is the Prerogative of <HI>Truth,</HI> that compels me to my Opinion, I will take care, That the
E&s;teem, I profe&s;s for your Works, &s;hall be no <HI>barren Compliment</HI>;
for my Prai&s;e &s;hall be &s;econded by the <HI>Applau&s;e</HI> of a whole <HI>People.</HI></P>
<P>Or, if, notwith&s;tanding my Endeavours, &s;ome low Spirits &s;hall
be found, who may affect to think otherwi&s;e, Time will make them but too
&s;en&s;ible, that the Faults, they <PB N="121" REF="130"> impute to <HI>You,</HI> are Defects in their own Judgment. They are like People in the <HI>Jaundice,</HI> who &s;ee every Thing of that di&s;|temper'd Colour, which
them&s;elves are af|flicted by.</P>
<P>IN the Days of our Ance&s;tors, Per&s;ons of narrow Under&s;tanding
were implicite Ad|mirers of what was above their Comprehen|&s;ion; but now, by
a kind of <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> in modern Rea&s;on, Judgment <HI>extends</HI>
or <HI>contracts</HI> it&s;elf, to &s;it clo&s;e upon our <HI>Capacity</HI>;
and we approve, but ju&s;t as far, as we are able to under&s;tand; bla&s;ting
every Thing by our Cen&s;ure, that we cannot reach by our Practice. Yet I hope,
I do not pre&s;ume too much, when I &s;ay concerning your Works, That <HI>I
&s;ee Things as they are,</HI> and <HI>declare 'em</HI> what I <HI>&s;ee</HI>
them. Your Conceptions are &s;trong, and the Flight of your Imagination
out&s;oars every Thing but your Rea&s;on: Your Language is pure, and your
Expre&s;&s;ion &s;trongly Elegant.</P>
<P>I WILL conclude with this Caution; That you will be guilty in the
Eye of God, if you &s;uffer &s;uch a Pen to <HI>re&s;t</HI>; or if you <HI>em|ploy</HI> it too <HI>idly.</HI> You ought to apply your|&s;elf
henceforward, to grave and important Subjects; and I am content that you
&s;hall impute to <HI>Me,</HI> all the <HI>Blame,</HI> if, when you do &s;o,
you receive not the Returns, which will be due to you. Already I am medita|ting
an Opportunity to be known for</P>

<P>MY Old Maid, who has liv'd with me the&s;e thirty Years, and claims
the <HI>tuck|ing me up,</HI> as a Privilege annex'd to her <HI>Office</HI>;
left open my Window-curtains la&s;t Night, <PB N="125" REF="134"> which &s;o
early let in the Beams of the Sun upon me, that I was wak'd from a Dream, which
I cou'd have wi&s;h'd to enjoy much longer.</P>
<P>FANCY had remov'd all my Di&s;tance from Youth; and given me back
tho&s;e gentle Flames, which warm and brighten Life in its <HI>Morning.</HI> I
&s;aw an adorable Object, which my Soul, me|thought, had once been
pa&s;&s;ionately fond of: And of who&s;e Perfections I imagin'd my&s;elf to
have been vertuou&s;ly enamour'd: But I had lo&s;t her, as I fancy'd, in <HI>Death.</HI> Oh! the Pain of that Imagination was terrible even in Sleep! I
&s;aw this lovely Per&s;on, adorn'd with all her Sweetne&s;s! I heard the
Mu&s;ick of her Accents, informing me, &s;he was <HI>my PATTY.</HI> Now grown
kinder and more &s;en&s;ible, I even <HI>felt</HI> her leaning over me; and
found the animat|ing Influence of her Soul-enchanting Pre&s;&s;ures! With what
Ec&s;ta&s;y of Fondne&s;s did I &s;urvey her lovely Languor! Her Eyes were
melting|ly relax'd; and their Beams &s;erenely temper'd with angelick
Softne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion. Her very <HI>Soul</HI> &s;eem'd to &s;hine upon
me, through the Smile of every Feature. Oh! how beau|tiful is a cha&s;t
Pa&s;&s;ion! How &s;weetly does it remain upon the Mind, and appeal from <HI>Death</HI> to the <HI>Memory!</HI> I never knew, till this dear Dream
convinc'd me, what I lo&s;t by not lov|ing, while my <HI>Body,</HI> as well as
my <HI>Soul,</HI> cou'd have done Ju&s;tice to the Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>WHILE I was thus tenderly employ'd, I wi&s;h &s;ome Arti&s;t cou'd
have &s;natch'd my Pic|ture! Old as I am, I flatter my&s;elf, That Love 
<PB N="126" REF="135"> wou'd have lent it Lu&s;tre. I wou'd have all my
Friends, who <HI>are not,</HI> re&s;olve immediate|ly, to commence <HI>Lovers.</HI> The In&s;ipids, who have never <HI>lov'd,</HI> may be &s;aid
to live as the Greedy <HI>drink</HI>; they <HI>&s;wallow</HI> Life without <HI>ta&s;t|ing</HI> it.</P>
<P>BUT, all tran&s;ported as I was, with this charming Dream, it was
ravi&s;h'd from me, by the Sun. Yet did I not <HI>complain.</HI> It had tun'd
my Soul to Harmony; and transform'd me from an Old <HI>Philo&s;opher,</HI> into
a young and hap|py <HI>Wanton!</HI> I &s;tarted from my Bed, and flew with
Vigour to the Gla&s;s! to which I have long accu&s;tom'd my&s;elf to creep
without Tran&s;port. Old and Worm-eaten as it is in every Part of its broad
Frame, yet did it not alarm me. I even &s;aw my own Face in it without the
lea&s;t Mortification. Nay, I took Notice, That my Night-cap was not &s;o White
as it ought to have been; which in more unpolite Hours, I &s;hou'd have thought
not worth remarking. But <HI>Love</HI> adorns and improves us! My Bo|&s;om
&s;well'd with Sighs, and my Eyes &s;hone with Plea&s;ure. I bru&s;h'd up my <HI>Mou&s;e-colour</HI> Gloves, and was wi&s;hing they had been <HI>Yellow
ones.</HI> I powder'd my &s;hort Hair; and comb'd it down to look longer. Nay I
almo&s;t arriv'd at the Foppery of &s;poiling my new <HI>Beaver,</HI> by
inflicting the modern <HI>Pinch</HI> on it. At length I remember'd, That my
Youth was but a <HI>Dream!</HI> And my <HI>PATTY</HI> a <HI>COQUET!</HI> My
Arms, at this Thought, folded &s;adly upon my Brea&s;t; I &s;unk into my ea&s;y
Chair, and was, &s;ome <PB N="127" REF="136"> Minutes, quite <HI>lo&s;t</HI>
there, before I cou'd recover my&s;elf. How dreadful is the De&s;cent, from
airy Plea&s;ure to &s;ub&s;tantial Mi&s;ery! It is not to be de&s;crib'd in
Pro&s;e, and &s;ince <HI>LOVE</HI> both de&s;erves good Poetry, and can
in&s;pire it, let me &s;ee what my <HI>Mu&s;e</HI> will &s;ay to it.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Oh! Lovely Object! Who&s;e dear Form I keep,</L> 
<L>In bu&s;y Daylight and in &s;ilent Sleep!</L> 
<L>Revi&s;it Fancy&mdash;to my Sighs attend;</L> 
<L>Thou <HI>imag'd Shadow</HI> of my Soul's &s;oft Friend!</L> 
<L>When I recall thy Beauties to my Mind,</L> 
<L>How <HI>dead</HI> are all Things thou ha&s;t left behind!</L> 
<L>Study, Pride, Friend&s;hip, langui&s;h for thy Sake;</L> 
<L>Oh! Why did <HI>Love</HI> from thy &s;weet Tomb awake?</L> 
<L>Why <HI>move</HI> his pointed Arrows in my Brea&s;t,</L> 
<L>In Life's De&s;cent, and the cool <HI>Vale</HI> of <HI>Re&s;t!</HI></L> 
<L>Oh! charm not thus my <HI>Soul,</HI> which is de&s;ign'd</L> 
<L>To <HI>flow</HI> down <HI>Time,</HI> and &s;trengthen Humankind!</L></Q>
<P>WELL! My Readers &s;hou'd think as I do, that all Things are for the <HI>Be&s;t.</HI> I lo&s;t my Dream, and they find a Poet. The Witlings will
&s;ay, a <HI>dreaming</HI> one! But Melancholy has its Charms, and I am <HI>&s;weetly Sad,</HI> in the Re|membrance of it.</P>
<P>WHILE I was indulging this mournful Tenderne&s;s, I heard a gentle Rap
at my Door, as if it fear'd to alarm me; and the Out&s;ide of it &s;eem'd to be
&s;wept by the ru&s;tling of Silk; a Mu&s;ick I am not us'd to! I open'd it
&s;low|ly, for I was &s;till lo&s;t to my&s;elf; and was ad|dre&s;s'd by a <HI>Lady</HI> in a mode&s;t but mo&s;t en|chanting <PB N="128" REF="137">
Manner. She appear'd to be near thirty; and was dre&s;s'd, very gravely, a
little remov'd from the pre&s;ent <HI>Mode.</HI> But my Heart &s;prung within
me! For all the Beauties of my Vi&s;ion were more than verify'd in this <HI>Reality!</HI> The Soul of a <HI>God</HI> &s;eem'd to &s;tream through her
Eyes! And the Ideas of her Wit and Maje&s;tick Under&s;tanding <HI>flam'd</HI>
and <HI>&s;parkled</HI> in her <HI>meaning Softne&s;s!</HI> There was
&s;omething in her Air, that made the Room &s;eem to <HI>blaze</HI> round her!
I led her to my great Chair, but &s;he gracefully declin'd it, and &s;eated
her&s;elf at &s;ome Di&s;tance, not to &s;hew the Re|&s;pect &s;he had, to my <HI>Age,</HI> I hope, but my <HI>Writings:</HI> After a Preface, of the
&s;weete&s;t Prai&s;e, that Vanity cou'd wi&s;h to hear, &s;he took a Paper
from her Bo&s;om; and &s;eem'd to tremble, while &s;he gave it me, as if it

<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Good SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAIT on you, with my own Letter, from the Re&s;pectful De&s;ire I
have to &s;ee the Per&s;on of him, who&s;e Soul I &s;o much admire, in the
PLAIN DEALER. I knew very well, That the Reverence you mu&s;t in|&s;pire, wou'd
prevent my &s;peaking freely, and <PB N="129" REF="138"> I cho&s;e therefore,
to <HI>write,</HI> what I wi&s;hed to inform you of.</P>
<P>I WAS the other Day, in an A&s;&s;embly, of what the World calls <HI>fine Ladies</HI>; to which gay Part of our Species I have lately been a
Stranger, &s;o that I found their Dre&s;s, and their Conver&s;ation entirely
Foreign to me; though, (through all Di&s;gui&s;es) I could di&s;|cover the <HI>Briti&s;h Beauty!</HI>&mdash;The Con|fu&s;ion of their Fans, and the
Loudne&s;s of their Laughter, alarm'd, and oppre&s;s'd my Ear; as the new
Situation of their Elbows drew my Eye under A&s;toni&s;hment! One of the
Ladies, who, I fear for her own &s;ake, is what they call a <HI>Toa&s;t,</HI>
was, mo&s;t lamenta|bly, delighted with a young Gentleman, who &s;at next her,
and who by the Oddne&s;s of his Dre&s;s, &s;urpriz'd me, more than the Ladies
did.&mdash;His Wig, in&s;tead of gracefully adorning his Shoulders, was tuck'd
up into a Bag, of the &s;ame <HI>Content</HI> with his Head; and had two Wings
&s;hooting from it; &s;o that he look'd like a <HI>Mercury revers'd.</HI> The
lit|tle Hair, that e&s;cap'd this Bag, (becau&s;e no Hat was allowed to
&s;hield it) was cemented by Oil and Powder; to &s;ecure it again&s;t
Tempe&s;t. The Sleeve of his Coat had re|mov'd the Middle of his Arm, from the
Place I &s;hould have look'd for it in, and <HI>preferr'd</HI> the Bend of his
Elbow, to within three Inches of his Shoulder. His Stockings were &s;o high
embroider'd, that they left no Shape to his <PB N="130" REF="139"> Leg: And his
Hands, to his Fingers Ends, were <HI>entomb'd,</HI> in a Pair of Ruffles. He
was button'd up to the Chin, in a white Dimmity Wai&s;tcoat; and wore a Frock,
which, I &s;up|po&s;e, he borrow'd from one of his Grooms, to emulate the <HI>Jockey Air</HI> with the more Ele|gance, and Propriety.</P>
<P>AS odd a Creature as this was, he &s;eem'd to con&s;ider <HI>Me</HI>
as an <HI>Odder</HI>; for I over-heard him whi&s;per his fair Neighbour, That,
by my Ill Dre&s;s, and my Neglect of the Company, I mu&s;t be either a <HI>Wit,</HI> or a <HI>Tory!</HI> It was plain, he &s;aid, from my Behaviour,
that I was unlearned in the new World, and he fancied, for his Part, that I
dropt out of the <HI>Eclip&s;e,</HI> la&s;t <HI>Monday</HI>!&mdash;The
Favourite Lady oblig'd him with a tender Look; and bur&s;t into a loud
Laughter. I found that all his Di&s;cour&s;e was fill'd with Arrogance, and
Folly; and a Mon&s;ter bred of both, which they call <HI>Double Entendres.</HI>
At la&s;t, he hum'd half a Tune; danc'd a Step or two, to his own Mu&s;ick;
took <HI>Snuff</HI> and <HI>Leave</HI> to|gether; and <HI>hopt</HI> out of the
Company.</P>
<P>The Ladies were now at Lei&s;ure to look a little at me. But their
Hearts &s;eem'd &s;trangely full of this ridiculous Object, whom they
immediately fell a prai&s;ing, with a kind of mi&s;erable Emulation. Mr. <HI>Flu&s;hcheek,</HI> &s;aid the <HI>Toa&s;t,</HI> is, &s;ure! the mo&s;t
delightful Crea|ture! the fine&s;t, and be&s;t-bred Gentleman! how witty! how
tender! how polite and <PB N="131" REF="140"> how <HI>&s;evere,</HI> he is! He
is the Soul of Sen&s;e, and Gallantry; and the very Life of the <HI>Ma&s;querade:</HI> I &s;tarted, at their Admiration; and felt my Heart
&s;ink into Pity for 'em; while I contemplated, in Silence, the Perfecti|on of
my adorable <HI>Bellario.</HI></P>
<P>OH! Mr. PLAIN DEALER! that I had pro|per Language to convey him to
your Ima|gination! You wou'd then approve my Pa&s;|&s;ion: And I &s;hou'd be
ju&s;tify'd even to your <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> His Per&s;on is divinely form'd,
Tall and Graceful! His Eyes, which are full of Wi&s;dom, wear a <HI>Gentlene&s;s,</HI> as if they griev'd their own Lu&s;tre, and were willing
to <HI>decline</HI> them&s;elves in Pity to the Beholders! His Lips are rarely
open'd but to <HI>prai&s;e</HI> or to <HI>improve,</HI> though he has Teeth,
which he might be proud of &s;hewing. There is, in the Turn of his Arms, an
inexpre&s;&s;ible Air of Maje&s;ty! I never look on him without <HI>&s;eeing</HI> all the great Men, I have read of. I trem|ble before him,
with a kind of <HI>religious Pa&s;|&s;ion!</HI> For Religion and Virtue are
adorn'd by his Conver&s;ation! So that I may &s;ay, without Fal&s;hood, that it
is <HI>Heaven</HI> to <HI>hear</HI> him! His Dre&s;s is di&s;engag'd; and he <HI>knows</HI> all Things but, that he is charming! Oh! that you were
acquainted with his Mind, which is &s;hining with every Virtue! Amid&s;t the
Throng of his Beauties, I forgot to tell you, That he is a <HI>Poet,</HI> a
mo&s;t <HI>Divine</HI> one! Believe me it is no <HI>Fiction!</HI> Place him
there|fore <PB N="132" REF="141"> before Mr. <HI>Flu&s;hcheek</HI>'s Eyes; and
con|vert his fair Admirers: for they take in the PLAIN DEALER.</P>

<P>I FELL a&s;leep, the other Night, after medi|tating, in my Bed, on our
general Di&s;&s;a|tisfaction, at the Fortune that is alloted us; and had,
again, an extraordinary Dream, but <PB N="133" REF="142"> very different from
my la&s;t; and &s;o &s;trongly di&s;tinct, and entertaining, that I flatter
my&s;elf, my <HI>Readers</HI> will be glad to &s;hare its Impre&s;&s;ion, while
it is new, upon my Memory.</P>
<P>I WAS plac'd, I knew not how, on the Top of a green Hill; which was
very flow'ry, and fragrant. The World, methought, lay under it, in a va&s;t
De&s;cent of Cloudine&s;s! A thou&s;and Roads led up to it; but, with &s;uch
intricate, and mazy Windings, that my Eye was unable to trace any of them,
di&s;tinctly: Yet they, all, open'd at la&s;t, upon the Summit of the Hill, and
pour'd out a mix'd Multitude, of both Sexes, and of all Ages, and Conditions;
who, as &s;oon as they had reach'd the Flat, ha&s;ten|ed forward towards its
Center.</P>
<P>I WAS wonderfully pleas'd, to di&s;cover <HI>Patty Amble,</HI> in the
Crowd; and, giving her my Hand, led her on, with great Compo&s;ure. She
inform'd me, That the Place we were up|on, was the <HI>Mount of Fortune</HI>;
and, That &s;he was going to a <HI>Fair,</HI> which is held on it, and call'd, <HI>Mend-all Market.</HI> Her Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he &s;aid, was to change her
Condition, for a Bet|ter; and, &s;he doubted not, but I might do the &s;ame, if
I pleas'd, &s;ince I had found my Way, up the Hill. For all People, who came
thither, were allow'd the happy Privilege, to lay down their own Burdens; and
take up lighter, in the Room of them.</P>
<P>IN the very middle of the Plain, we came, at length, to a kind of <HI>May-Pole,</HI> which was bigger than the <HI>Monument</HI>; and as high as
the <PB N="134" REF="143"> <HI>Pike</HI> of <HI>Teneriff:</HI> It was of a
bright <HI>Yellow,</HI> or <HI>Gold-colour</HI>; but twinkled, &s;trangely, at
a Di&s;tance; and looked dazling, and tran&s;parent. There hung, off from it,
all about, lovely Garlands, of precious Stones, with a Mixture of the
&s;weete&s;t Flowers; the <HI>Hues</HI> of which were <HI>changeable,</HI> and
varied every Moment, with a mo&s;t bewitching Delightfulne&s;s. Upon the
Pinacle of this Pyramid, &s;at the Godde&s;s of the Place, very bu&s;ily
&s;pinning: But the Thread &s;he twi&s;ted off, was too <HI>fine,</HI> to be
&s;een, di&s;tinct|ly, by Us, who &s;tood, &s;o far, below it. The Wheel, in
its Motion, made a mu&s;ical Sound; but &s;o rough, and &s;o loud, that it
&s;hook the Hill, all round it. It &s;catter'd, while &s;he turn'd it, a
&s;parkling Shower of <HI>Globules,</HI> that were many-colour'd, but hollow;
and broke, like empty Bubbles, in their de&s;cending over the Multitude.</P>
<P>WHAT I ob&s;erv'd, with mo&s;t Concern, was, that, the nearer we came,
the Pro&s;pect grew le&s;s charming; for the Du&s;t was &s;o thick, that our
Eyes, and Mouths, were filled with it; and our Heads ak'd with the Bu&s;tle,
and the Noi&s;e, of the Tumult. The Commodities, which were to be barter'd for,
lay, &s;pread, every where, in Heaps; and All, who pa&s;s'd between, were
invited to come, and cheapen them.&mdash;<HI>Sweet|meats, Limonades,</HI> and
Variety of the fine&s;t <HI>Fruits,</HI> were offer'd, diligently, up and down,
by little <HI>Cupids,</HI> with painted Baskets: And Trumpeters, Jugglers,
Rope-dancers, <HI>Merry-Andrews,</HI> and <HI>Opera-Mongers,</HI> were exerting
<PB N="135" REF="144"> them&s;elves, on all Sides, to compleat the Up|roar of
the Market. But, tho' I pa&s;s'd by all their <HI>Stages,</HI> I &s;aw no more
than <HI>Two,</HI> who&s;e Faces were well known to me; and Tho&s;e were, <HI>Heidegger,</HI> and <HI>Doctor Fau&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Front of every Pile, ro&s;e an <HI>Alaba&s;ter Pillar,</HI>
whereon hung a Picture, fill'd with Figures, all in <HI>Motion</HI>;
repre&s;enting whatever was mo&s;t tempting, and de&s;irable, in the
Mer|chandize it recommended. And, at the Foot of each Pillar, was placed an <HI>Ebony Chair</HI>; on both Sides of which, &s;tood young, and beau|tiful
Women, dre&s;s'd like <HI>Mu&s;es</HI> and <HI>Graces:</HI> Some inviting
Pa&s;&s;engers to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Empty Seat; and others
pointing up, to a Compartment, on the Top of it, where was to be read, in
golden Letters, the Name, and Quality, of the Merchandize.</P>
<P>WE made up, to a Heap, that was remark|ably higher than the Re&s;t;
and read, there, the Word <HI>ROYALTY.</HI> We were agreeably &s;urpriz'd, to
&s;ee, moving, in the Picture, that hung upon this Pillar, <HI>Armies,
Palaces,</HI> and <HI>Navies!</HI> Crowds of Men, upon their Knees; and Women,
&s;till more pro&s;trate!&mdash;Banquets, Trea&s;ures, Sports, and Triumphs,
all &s;ucceed|ing, in their Turns, drew a mighty Crowd of Gazers; who were
&s;truggling for the Chair, and pu&s;h'd each other from it. <HI>Patty
Amble</HI> was very earne&s;t, to have had <HI>me</HI> put in for it: But I
wink'd upon her, to be quiet; and pre|&s;ently, we &s;aw a Per&s;on, breaking
&s;trong|ly through the Crowd; who, with loud <PB N="136" REF="145"> <HI>Huzza</HI>'s, and Concurrence, plac'd him, there, and bow'd round
him.&mdash;But, no &s;ooner was he &s;eated, when the tempting Figures, in the
Picture, chang'd, immediately, into <HI>horrible</HI> Ones!&mdash;Cares,
Dangers, Hatred, Re&s;tle&s;s|ne&s;s, and a thou&s;and <HI>&s;ooty Furies,</HI>
roll'd, un|quietly, about him! The <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Graces,</HI> were
transform'd into <HI>Serpents,</HI> and <HI>Satyrs!</HI> that hi&s;s'd,
grinn'd, and pointed at him. And, when he wou'd have, gladly, e&s;cap'd, and
&s;prung out of the Chair, he found him&s;elf held down in it, by a Troop of <HI>meagre Phan|toms,</HI> that frighted us away, from any further
Ob&s;ervation of him.</P>
<P>THE next Place, that we &s;topp'd at, was the Column of BEAUTY. We
look'd up, to the Picture, and &s;aw, moving, in it, a mix'd, and confus'd
Bu&s;tle, of Coaches, Footmen, and Coronets: Men, with their Hearts in their
Hands; and an indi&s;tinct Cavalcade, of &s;hape|le&s;s Things, without Heads,
call'd Smiles, Sighs, Vows, De&s;ires, Faintings, Langui&s;hments, and
Adorations. There came, up, to this Place, in great Hurry, a fat, but
&s;prightly, Young Woman, with a Bundle, under her Arm; which &s;he laid down,
by Way of Bar|ter; and which, we ob&s;erv'd, as &s;he &s;orted the Goods, to be
fill'd with large Legs, red Hair, brown Skin, big Brea&s;ts; and
Small-Pox-Marks, in abundance. The Attendants, at the Pillar, having agreed to
the Exchange, were inviting her into the <HI>Ebony</HI> Chair; when I, who, by
this Time, began to &s;u&s;pect their fair Appear|ance, <PB N="137" REF="146"> <HI>turn'd</HI> the Picture, with my <HI>Stick:</HI> and expos'd its other Side
to the <HI>She-Merchant</HI>; which was to be Part of her Bargain, and
con|&s;i&s;ted of Scandal, Spleen, Jealou&s;y, Angui&s;h, Perjury, and Ruin.
She no &s;ooner &s;aw the Faces of this ugly Ne&s;t of Mon&s;ters, but,
&s;natching up her own Bundle, &s;he ran, as fa&s;t as her thick Legs cou'd
carry her; tumbling, Head over Heels, at every Heap in her Way; and getting up,
as &s;he be&s;t cou'd; without &s;taying, to look behind her.</P>
<P>WHILE we were diverting our&s;elves, at this plea&s;ant Flight, a
Per&s;on, whom Nature had de&s;ign'd, and limb'd, for a <HI>PLOWMAN,</HI> had
been &s;eiz'd with an Ambition to be made a <HI>Mini&s;ter of State</HI>; and,
having thrown down his Burden, of Toil, Penury, and Dirtine&s;s be|fore the
Pillar of POWER, had &s;eated him&s;elf, triumphantly, in the Chair, at the
Foot of it; but was frighted out of his Wits, by that time we came up to him;
for we found him al|mo&s;t &s;mother'd, under an unmerciful Load of Slanders,
Terrors, Axes, and Halters; which he had much ado to crawl out from; and was
bawling, with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, and Di&s;tortion of Mu&s;cles, to have his <HI>Own Goods</HI> re&s;tor'd him.</P>
<P>IN the next Compartment we examin'd, we found written the Word,
TITLES. We &s;aw, there, a Beau, with &s;ix Footmen behind him, very
earne&s;tly peru&s;ing the moving Trophies, in the Picture. My <HI>Coquet</HI>
felt her Heart beat, at the Sight of &s;o fine a Gentleman; and whi&s;|per'd 
<PB N="138" REF="147"> her Opinion, That I need not turn <HI>that</HI> Picture;
for &s;ure! there was no <HI>Ill</HI> to be ap|prehended, <HI>there</HI>;&mdash;I did it, however, and the Beau fell into Fits; at the
&s;udden ru&s;hing out of a Whirlwind of Ignorance, Conceited|ne&s;s, Scorn,
Luxury, and Di&s;ea&s;es!</P>
<P>I frighted an hone&s;t Citizen, in much the &s;ame Manner, from the
Standard of WEALTH. He had taken a Fancy for Preferment: and was wi&s;hing,
extremely, to be erected into an <HI>Alderman!</HI>&mdash;He had counted out,
for the Pur|cha&s;e, a Life-full of Ea&s;e; a &s;mall Parcel of
Under&s;tanding; and <HI>Ditto,</HI> of Con&s;cience. But, the very Minute I
turn'd the Picture, there flew, into his Face, Dullne&s;s, Cuckoldom, and
Clum&s;ine&s;s! upon which he took to his Heels, and left his <HI>own Bag</HI>
behind him.</P>
<P>AT the Column of WIT, I was agreeably entertain'd, among a large
Circle of <HI>Gapers,</HI> who were admiring the wonderful <HI>Mechani&s;m</HI>
of the Picture, that was hung upon that Pillar.&mdash;Cities, Mountains,
Oceans, Woods, Skies, Meadows, Gardens, Gods, and Godde&s;&s;es, Gi|ants,
Mermaids, Cupids, Dragons, Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, Witches, Enchanted Ca&s;tles,
Fields of Air; and Seas of Fire; all, delightfully, intermix'd, and confounded,
ro&s;e, and charm'd the Ob&s;er|vation!&mdash;But the Crowd di&s;pers'd,
immedi|ately, on my di&s;covering, to their great Ter|ror, and Amazement, that
there lurk'd, behind all this Gaiety, a <HI>lean</HI> Society, call'd Envy,
Malice, Poverty, Dependence, and Calamity!</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="148">I WALK'D quite through the <HI>Fair</HI>; and,
where-ever I wander'd, perceived it was, in all Parts, alike. They, who brought <HI>Complaints,</HI> to exchange, again&s;t <HI>Good-Fortune,</HI> cho&s;e to
carry their <HI>own</HI> back again, rather than con|clude a <HI>New</HI>
Bargain. There was &s;omething, in every Heap, that they were inclinable enough
to purcha&s;e;&mdash;But there was &s;ome|thing too, that mu&s;t go with it,
which they could not bear to be troubled with: &s;o, they went murmuring, away;
and be&s;tow'd their Cur&s;es, in great Plenty, on the Godde&s;s, who kept the
Market; which was never the thinner, notwith&s;tanding; for, &s;till, new
Crowds &s;up|ply'd the Places of tho&s;e, who return'd, di&s;|&s;atisfy'd. Nor
cou'd the Warnings they met with, from &s;uch Numbers who had been
di&s;|appointed, prevail with the&s;e new Comers, to believe, they &s;hou'd go
back again, without being the Richer, from a <HI>Mart,</HI> that was &s;tor'd,
&s;o plentifully, with all, that the World calls Valuable.</P>
<P>AMONG the infinite Variety of Temptati|ons, which glitter'd, every
where, about me, I was in Danger but once; and That was, at the Pillar of FAME.
I &s;aw, when I turn'd that Picture, that the Weight of the Counter-balance
lay, chiefly, in the&s;e four Evils,&mdash;<HI>Death, Time, Detraction,</HI>
and <HI>Uncertainty!</HI> Yet, &s;o &s;trong was my De&s;ire to float my Name
through Futurity, that I was re&s;olutely deter|min'd to take
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Chair.&mdash;But, having Nothing of Value about me,
but my <PB N="140" REF="149"> <HI>Oaken Stick,</HI> and <HI>Mou&s;e-colour'd
Gloves,</HI> (the fir&s;t of which they refus'd, becau&s;e of the Mi&s;chief it
had done 'em, in turning up the wrong Sides of their Pictures; and the Second,
be|cau&s;e not <HI>fine</HI> enough to be fa&s;hionable, in that Region,) I was
forc'd upon an Expedient, which I am almo&s;t afraid to confe&s;s, for fear of
lo&s;ing, for ever, the Good Opinion of my Female Readers.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay all, in a Word, I was, heroically, re&s;olv'd, to give up my <HI>Love</HI> for my <HI>Glory</HI>; &s;o, taking <HI>Patty Amble</HI> by the
Hand, I prof|fer'd <HI>Her,</HI> in Barter, (having no <HI>Other
Com|modity.</HI>) The Attendants, who watch'd the Pillar, were ju&s;t ready to
take hold of her; when &s;he threw her Arms about my Neck, and <HI>conjur'd</HI> me, by all the Tyes, of Honour, and of Gallantry, that I
wou'd not leave her, a Sa|crifice, to &s;o empty a Divinity, as the Regent of
that Mountain! She begg'd, that I wou'd return, with her, to the Lower, but
happier World: and, whatever I &s;hould ask of her, &s;he wou'd grant me, by
Way of Recompence. I took her &s;uddenly, at her Word, and ask'd her <HI>Heart</HI> for a <HI>Fairing.</HI>&mdash;Nay, &s;pare me but that One
Thing, &s;aid &s;he, with a langui&s;hing Re|proachfulne&s;s, and take <HI>any
thing el&s;e, about me.</HI></P>
<P>Unfortunately overjoy'd, at this Bli&s;s, which, methought, befel me,
the &s;udden Flow of my Spirits, under a Sen&s;e of the promis'd Tran&s;port,
caus'd &s;o violent an Agitation, that, waking on a &s;udden, I dropt, out of

<P>I PASS &s;ome agreeable Hours, now and then, at the Hou&s;e of <HI>Sir
Portly Rufus,</HI> an old and wealthy Acquaintance; who lives, a few Miles, out
of Town; and having got his E&s;tate, by a long and bu&s;y Life, &s;pent in
Trading, adventurou&s;ly, to mo&s;t Parts of the World, is, now, retir'd from
its Hurry; and enjoys it with a graceful Ea&s;e, and unde|&s;igning
Ho&s;pitality. The only Inconvenience, I have to complain of, when I am with
him, is, that the Company I meet there, is not &s;o Delicate as I cou'd wi&s;h
it; but mix'd with that Ineligance, which mu&s;t be expected, and &s;ubmitted

find much Plea&s;ure, is, be|cau&s;e every Per&s;on, not under &s;ome immediate
Guard of <HI>Hope, Fear,</HI> or <HI>Reverence,</HI> keeps only <HI>Him&s;elf</HI> in View: And directs his Di&s;|cour&s;e, and Behaviour, <HI>not</HI> to the Ta&s;te of tho&s;e he &s;hou'd Entertain; but to the
parti|cular Bent of his own Humour, or Capacity.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t con&s;tant Gue&s;ts, at <HI>Sir Portly</HI>'s, is <HI>Tony Gingle</HI> his Si&s;ter's Son; who has a great Genius for Poetry. He
makes very good Ver&s;es, and pronounces, gracefully enough, tho&s;e he
repeats, from other Writers,&mdash;&s;o far, all is well. But the wor&s;t of it
is, that <HI>Tony</HI> has &s;tudied nothing, <HI>but</HI> Poetry. He is quite
dark in the u&s;eful Doctrine of Times, Sea&s;ons, and Places. It is the &s;ame
Thing to <HI>him,</HI> when the Mu&s;e <HI>bites,</HI> whether he quotes
Tragedy, to a Man of Letters, his Taylor's Wife, or a Stockjobber. The Chimes
of his Numbers are for ever, ringing in his Fancy: And all, who chance to &s;it
near him, mu&s;t have their Share of the Melody. He has taken it into his Head,
that, becau&s;e <HI>he</HI> can make a con&s;iderable Figure, <HI>as a
Poet,</HI> there is nothing, con&s;iderable, <HI>but Poetry!</HI> And it is a
very plea&s;ant Scene to ob&s;erve <HI>Tony,</HI> &s;tudying, at one of the
Tables of a full Coffee-Hou&s;e, in the mid&s;t of the City; &s;canning
Ver&s;es, on his Fingers: Conceiving, writing, and blotting out: And humming
them over, to him&s;elf, <PB N="143" REF="152"> with all the Rapture, and
Ge&s;ticulation, of <HI>Tone, Action,</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion!</HI>
Regardle&s;s that he is &s;tar'd at, and remark'd, all the while, by a dozen or
two of thriving Citizens; who &s;hake their Heads and <HI>pity</HI> him, as a
Man, that has <HI>lo&s;t</HI> his <HI>Wits</HI>; even while he is under the <HI>Ope|ration</HI> of being <HI>Witty!</HI>&mdash;He has never per|mitted his
Brain to grow cool enough to re|flect, That <HI>Wit,</HI> in dull Company, is
the dulle&s;t Subject in the World; and that it is a Folly, to talk of <HI>Homer, Horace,</HI> or <HI>Pope,</HI> among Grave Fellows within <HI>Ludgate</HI>; who, when they hear of a Great Poet, will tell you a Story of <HI>Tom Brown</HI>; and feel no Difference in the Power of <HI>Tony
Gingle</HI>'s own Works, and the humble La|bours of their <HI>Bellman.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jack Juniper,</HI> the Apothecary; and <HI>Tom Tire&s;ome,</HI>
the Haberda&s;her, living both in the &s;ame Street, ride down together, twice
a Week, to take a Bottle, with my Friend, <HI>Sir Portly.</HI>&mdash;<HI>Jack
Juniper</HI> reads us Lectures, on the new Improvements in <HI>Botany,</HI> and
the Ri&s;e, and Progre&s;s of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> which are, accurately,
an&s;wer'd, by Mr. <HI>Thomas Tire&s;ome</HI>; with the Price of the <HI>Stocks</HI>; and the Mournful Decay of the <HI>Spittle-fields
Weaving.</HI>&mdash;As &s;oon as this very able Apothecary has open'd, and
ex|plain'd to us, the <HI>Circulation of the Blood,</HI> the punctual
Haberda&s;her repays his Kindne&s;s, with the <HI>Cour&s;e of Exchange.</HI> If
&s;ome <HI>Patient,</HI> of the One, has taken <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> for her <HI>Complexion</HI>; &s;ome Lady, who is the Other's Cu&s;tomer, has, with
equal Advantage to her Skin, fallen into <PB N="144" REF="153"> the Wear of his
new <HI>Blu&s;h-Colour.</HI>&mdash;But, in the very Heighth of their <HI>Elucidations, Tony Gingle</HI> never fails to <HI>wedge in,</HI> between
'em both, &s;ome &s;ix Dozen of Quotations, from a Poem, call'd the <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ary</HI>; though the intel|ligent Mr. <HI>Juniper</HI> is
continually interrupting him with the <HI>true Hi&s;tory</HI> of every weighty
Occurrence, in <HI>Apothecaries-Hall,</HI> which pro|vok'd the Mu&s;e of the
merry <HI>Doctor.</HI> While poor <HI>Tom Tire&s;ome,</HI> when he has yawn'd,
and li&s;ten'd, in vain, to the full Extent of his Pa|tience, for an
Opportunity to grow Eloquent on the U&s;e of <HI>Colche&s;ter-Bays,</HI> falls
a&s;leep, in his Chair; and <HI>&s;nores</HI> at us, in Revenge, to maintain
his Part in the Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>HONEST <HI>Sir Portly</HI> wou'd be often at a Lo&s;s, to &s;hape
&s;uch &s;tubborn <HI>Obliquities,</HI> into any <HI>direct Line</HI> of
Society, if he had not, al|ways, at his Elbow, the good-natur'd Mr. <HI>William
Weathercock,</HI> a Gentleman Farmer, in his Neighbourhood; who has a large,
but empty, Under&s;tanding.&mdash;The Mind of <HI>Will. Weathercock</HI> is
like the Sail of a great Ship, that has <HI>Room,</HI> to contain much Wind;
but, hav|ing none, of its own producing, is &s;well'd out, by Turns, from all
the Quarters of the Com|pa&s;s. <HI>Will.</HI> hits every Man's Ta&s;te; and is
of all People's Opinion. He is &s;o de&s;irous to <HI>Oblige,</HI> that there
is not a Point in the <HI>Circum|ference,</HI> but wou'd &s;erve him for a <HI>Center.</HI> He is this Moment, in <HI>your</HI> Sentiment: and, the <HI>next,</HI> will, before your Face, be of his Opinion who contradicts you.
But, if a Third <PB N="145" REF="154"> affirms you <HI>Both</HI> to have been
in the Wrong, and appeals to <HI>Will. Weathercock:</HI>&mdash;<HI>Will,</HI>
with the be&s;t-bred Agility in the World, &s;hifts, immediately, to <HI>his</HI> Side, too; and thinks it as clear as the Sun that You were, <HI>All Three,</HI> in the Right of it.</P>
<P>THIS pliable Ductility, in the Rea&s;on of <HI>Will. Weathercock,</HI>
hitches in, and chains toge|ther, the mo&s;t repugnant Idea's; and, uniting
them into an active Body, like the <HI>hook'd Atoms,</HI> of <HI>Des
Cartes,</HI> gives 'em Strength, Fluidity, and Con&s;equence. Such a lively
Effect have the very <HI>Weakne&s;&s;es</HI> of Humanity beyond the Force, and
Subtlety, of Ill-Nature, and Self-Intere&s;t!</P>
<P><HI>Tony Gingle,</HI> the la&s;t Time that I &s;aw this Company
together, was &s;o put to it, for an Opportunity, to repeat &s;ome Ver&s;es, he
was <HI>big with,</HI> that, in order to <HI>bring 'em in,</HI> with a
tolerable Appearance of Propriety, he began, to compliment <HI>Sir
Portly</HI>'s Lady, on the Fine|ne&s;s of her Shape, and Skin, and inferring,
from their being Prai&s;e-worthy, that they &s;hould lie open to Ob&s;ervation,
took Occa&s;ion, by the&s;e Lines, to enforce his kind Opinion, that it was
nece&s;&s;ary for her, to <HI>go naked.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<L>Can Forms, like yours, want Ornament of Dre&s;s?</L> 
<L>Beauty, like <HI>Truth,</HI> &s;hines mo&s;t, in <HI>Nakedne&s;s.</HI></L> 
<L>Dre&s;&s;ing, may skreen Deformities from View:</L> 
<L>But, even, Adornment does but <HI>&s;hadow you!</HI></L> 
<L>Mo&s;t, but by what they wear are lovely made:</L> 
<L>You, Madam, <HI>lo&s;e,</HI> whene'er you &s;eek &s;uch Aid.</L> 
<L><PB N="146" REF="155">While others dre&s;s, their Lovers Hearts to
warm,</L> 
<L>You <HI>put off</HI> nothing, but what <HI>veil'd</HI> a Charm!</L></Q>
<P>THE Lady blu&s;h'd, and &s;mil'd. <HI>Sir Portly</HI> laugh'd aloud;
and begg'd to hear 'em over again. For my Part, I was doubly pleas'd, with the
Turn of the Ver&s;e; and Particularity of the Fancy. <HI>Tony Gingle,</HI>
him&s;elf, was in Raptures, which he cou'd not hide, at the Applau&s;e his
Mu&s;e had met with.&mdash;But <HI>Tom Tire&s;ome</HI> had been weighing with
the Fore&s;ight of a prudent Citizen, the Ill Con&s;equence of <HI>going
naked,</HI> to his good Friends the <HI>Weavers,</HI> and felt a commendable
Indignation, again&s;t the tuneful Mr. <HI>Gingle</HI>; in&s;omuch that in the
Heat of his Re&s;entment, he call'd him <HI>Madman</HI>; and <HI>Ballad-Singer</HI>&mdash;Pray, what do you &s;up|po&s;e, &s;aid he, wou'd
become of many thou|&s;and hone&s;t People, who live, by making <HI>Pet|ticoats,</HI> and what <HI>belongs</HI> to Petticoats, if all
hand&s;ome Women were to go <HI>impudently Na|ked!</HI>&mdash;Out upon it!
Methinks I <HI>&s;ee</HI> 'em; and am a&s;ham'd of you! It is &s;candalous, and
in|decent; and to &s;ay nothing of the <HI>Plot,</HI> which may lie, conceal'd,
in it, again&s;t <HI>Trade</HI>; it is the Whim of a <HI>Heathen Turk</HI>! and
not fit to be thought of, in a <HI>Chri&s;tian-Country!</HI></P>
<P><HI>TONY</HI> by this Time had fathom'd the <HI>Depth</HI> of his
Antagoni&s;t, and began to play upon him, from his Batteries of poetical
Ar|tillery; the War was growing hot: and threa|tened dangerous Con&s;equences,
when <HI>Will. Weathercock</HI> put in, between 'em, and taking 
<PB N="147" REF="156"> Part with the <HI>Wit,</HI> becau&s;e he ob&s;erv'd him
to be a Favourite, made this Charge, upon his Oppo&s;ite, like a brave and
faithful Auxiliary.</P>
<P>YOU are certainly in the right, mo&s;t divert|ing Mr. <HI>Gingle!</HI>&mdash;Nature never wou'd have cover'd Women with &s;uch white,
and tempt|ing Skins, if &s;he had not meant 'em for a pub|lick Ornament. The
Ladies are Nature's Fa|vourites; and, can we &s;uppo&s;e her to have been
le&s;s liberal, to tho&s;e <HI>Favourites</HI>; than to the <HI>Bea&s;ts,</HI>
which &s;he plac'd below 'em?&mdash;She never &s;ent us a <HI>Calf,</HI> but he
came into the World, with his <HI>Coat</HI> on. An <HI>Ox</HI> has no <HI>Breeches</HI> to pull off, when he goes to Bed weary. The <HI>Lamb</HI> is
born, ready dre&s;s'd, with her Freeze Coat about her. And who, ever, &s;aw a <HI>Sow,</HI> drawing off her Shoes, and Stockings?&mdash;None &s;leep &s;ofter
than the <HI>Birds</HI> do: Yet they ri&s;e, in the Morning, with their
Feather|beds, upon their Backs.&mdash;The mo&s;t Excel|lent, of the <HI>Virtues,</HI> are always painted, like <HI>Women</HI>; but it is, like <HI>Women, without Cloaths on!</HI> And, what does this mean, but to
in&s;inu|ate, to the Sex, that all, who love Virtue, &s;hou'd de&s;pi&s;e
Hoop-Petticoats, and <HI>go naked?</HI>&mdash;There is this manife&s;t
Ab&s;urdity in Wo|mens Dre&s;&s;ing, that it involves them in Per|plexities,
which make the chief End they dre&s;s for, much more difficult than it need be:
For, as they order the Matter, they are to be taken to Pieces, like <HI>Watches,</HI> before a Man can come <HI>near</HI> enough, to examine the <HI>Wonders</HI> of <PB N="148" REF="157"> their <HI>Workman&s;hip.</HI>&mdash;<HI>Fa&s;hions</HI> differ, in all Nations; and,
what is a fine Dre&s;s, in one Place, is a frightful one, in another. But, were
Women once uncover'd, all Mens Judg|ments wou'd agree, about 'em.&mdash;In a
Word, &s;ince the <HI>Sun, Moon,</HI> and <HI>Stars,</HI> appear, as Na|ture
has made 'em; &s;ince all <HI>Animals</HI> are &s;atis|fy'd with their own
natural Figures; and, &s;ince the <HI>Ro&s;es</HI> are not a&s;ham'd to &s;hew
their <HI>Thorns,</HI> with their <HI>Beauties</HI>; why &s;hou'd <HI>Woman,</HI> Na|ture's Ma&s;terpiece! &s;eek to hide, or di&s;gui&s;e, her
Loveline&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>WILL</HI> went, eloquently on, after this ex|traordinary Manner,
till he had fully con|vinc'd, and &s;atisfy'd, all that Part of his Au|dience,
who were on this fir&s;t Side the Que&s;tion. But, ca&s;ting his Eye, on poor <HI>Tom Tire&s;ome,</HI> and, pitying the melancholy Air, with which he
li&s;ten'd to an Opinion, he had not Wit enough to argue again&s;t, though he
thought it little Better than Fornication, and Adultery;&mdash;<HI>Will,</HI>
in &s;imple Hone&s;ty of Heart; and out of a mere Motive of Compa&s;&s;ion,
&s;lipt, by a very &s;udden Tran&s;ition, into a &s;ure Method of comforting
him; and chang'd his <HI>Level,</HI> as follows.</P>
<P>YET, I mu&s;t do Ju&s;tice to both Arguments, and it &s;eems plain,
beyond Contradiction, that Beauty was <HI>made,</HI> to be <HI>ornamented.</HI>
The Pea|cock's <HI>&s;tarry Tail,</HI> &s;hews, that Nature loves gay Fancies. <HI>Nature</HI> dre&s;s'd the Hills, and the Meadows, in their fine,
embroider'd Man|tles. <PB N="149" REF="158"> It was <HI>&s;he,</HI> that
&s;pangled over all that glorious <HI>Veil,</HI> of Heaven!&mdash;Who, but <HI>Na|ture,</HI> &s;potted the <HI>Ermin?</HI> And <HI>gilt</HI> the &s;caly
Skins, of Fi&s;hes, and of Serpents?&mdash;<HI>Man,</HI> indeed, &s;he &s;ent
into the World, plain, and naked:&mdash;Not, that &s;he meant, he &s;hou'd <HI>remain</HI> &s;o,&mdash;but, becau&s;e &s;he <HI>adorn'd</HI> all Things
el&s;e, for his <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> to chu&s;e a Dre&s;s from. What is the
Silkworm, but Nature's little <HI>Spin&s;ter,</HI> &s;et to Work for our common
Benefit? The very <HI>Spider</HI> keeps a <HI>Loom</HI>; and weaves a finer
Manufacture, than the Arti&s;ts of <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> can!&mdash;Why
&s;mell the&s;e love|ly Flowers, round the Summer-Hou&s;e we are &s;itting in,
&s;o delightfully &s;weet, and fragrant, but to teach us, That we &s;hou'd <HI>perfume</HI> our &s;elves? And, to what End can we &s;uppo&s;e they were
made, &s;o various, in their Colours, but to give Ladies the happy Hint, of
employ|ing <HI>Dyers,</HI> and <HI>Silk-weavers!</HI></P>
<P><HI>TOM TIRESOME</HI> broke in upon him, at tho&s;e two in&s;piring
Words, with a loud and triumphant <HI>Hollow</HI>; and filling, in&s;tantly, <HI>two Bumpers,</HI> drank Pro&s;perity to <HI>Trade</HI>; and Health and
Happine&s;s to Mr. <HI>Weathercock.</HI>&mdash;His Toa&s;ts went round the
Company; and both Parties were &s;o well &s;atisfied with the Share each had,
in his Deci&s;ion, that Neither of them appear'd &s;hock'd at the manife&s;t
Contradicti|on of his Rea&s;oning. But <HI>Tony Gingle</HI> went away, the
mo&s;t pleas'd, of the Two; becau&s;e <HI>Sir Portly</HI> de&s;ir'd him, at

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU ob&s;erved, very ju&s;tly, in one of your late Papers, that no
Figure in Life can be more graceful, and amiable, than that of a wi&s;e, and
good, Father; with Re&s;pect to an only Son, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and
de&s;erves, his Indulgence.</P>
<P>THAT Lover of Mankind, <HI>Horten&s;ius,</HI> gave us, lately, a
fine Example, of the Force of this Truth: But I look back, upon it with
Angui&s;h, becau&s;e I judge of his pre&s;ent <HI>Pain,</HI> by the Exce&s;s of
his pa&s;t <HI>Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>THO' <HI>Horten&s;ius</HI> had, properly, but one Son, he was, in
&s;ome Sen&s;e, the <HI>Common Fa|ther.</HI> <PB N="151" REF="160">&mdash;Nothing ever was carried higher than the <HI>Manline&s;s</HI>
of his Heart, except its <HI>Sweetne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Humanity:</HI> For he
was &s;often'd, by the benevolent Overflowings of a Pity, that touch'd him, at
once, in the two <HI>Extremes</HI> of Sen&s;ibi|lity! His own <HI>Joys</HI>
were damp'd, by other Peoples <HI>Afflictions</HI>; and his private <HI>Sorrows</HI> chear'd, by the <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> of tho&s;e who hated
him.&mdash;He not only <HI>forgave,</HI> readily, the mo&s;t malicious of his
Enemies; but, that he might be &s;ure to do it, generou&s;ly, he <HI>forgot</HI> the very <HI>Injuries.</HI>&mdash;Even his <HI>Faults</HI> were
no other, than the un&s;ucce&s;sful Re&s;ult of his <HI>Virtues</HI>; for
act|ing rather by the mea&s;ure of his <HI>Mind,</HI> than of his <HI>Power,</HI> he provok'd the Di&s;appointed; to whom the <HI>Will</HI> is no <HI>Obliger.</HI>&mdash;His <HI>Wit</HI> could fear no Rivals, but his <HI>Courage,</HI> and his <HI>Hone&s;ty:</HI>&mdash;And every Per&s;on who
&s;hall read this <HI>faint</HI> Character of his Excellence, has been oblig'd,
by the <HI>Effects</HI> of it; with regard to the Pub|lick Intere&s;t; and the
Ornaments of Society.</P>
<P>SUCH <HI>was Horten&s;ius!</HI>&mdash;and &s;uch <HI>Horten|&s;ius
is;</HI> if yet he may be &s;aid to <HI>be,</HI> after the Death of that dear <HI>Son,</HI> he <HI>liv'd in</HI>; and into who&s;e fine Mind he had pour'd
out, and trans|fus'd, all the Fullne&s;s of his Virtues; with a kind of Hope,
in <HI>him,</HI> and <HI>his,</HI> to have im|mortaliz'd his very <HI>Body!</HI> and to receive, from future Ages, in the Honours paid to his
De|&s;cendants, the Tribute of that <HI>Prai&s;e,</HI> which his own, declining
Life, is, now, too &s;canty to make Room for.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="161">HE, who knows the Father's Pro&s;pect; and how

feels it) &s;erves, for ever, to imbitter <HI>Hope</HI>; and draws Gloom enough
over the Mind, to put a Stop to our wild Pur&s;uits, of Riches, Power, and
Reputa|tion.</P>
<P>WHEN I compare the pre&s;ent Calamity of this Gentleman, with the
Satisfaction he is fallen from;&mdash;with that ripening
Expectati|on;&mdash;that ob&s;erving Vigilance; that un&s;peak|able
Succe&s;&s;ion of little Tran&s;ports, and tender Triumphs;&mdash;and all that

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>My SON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot be ignorant, &s;ince it is known to all the World, to
what Degree our People groan'd, under the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Oppre&s;|&s;ion.
We &s;aw, by the Lo&s;s of our <HI>Maritime Provinces,</HI> that we were cut
off from all Com|merce with the re&s;t of the World. You know, too, what it
co&s;t us, in the Begin|ning of this War, to qualify our&s;elves to give a
Check to &s;o implacable a Violence. But God led us by the Hand, till we were
wor|thy, in our Turn, to make that Enemy trem|ble, <PB N="157" REF="166">
before whom others had, long, trem|bled.&mdash;We owe this, next to God, to our
own, unwearied Toil; and the Affection of our <HI>Be&s;t Children,</HI> our
faithful, <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian Sub|jects.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, if, while I am viewing this Pro&s;pe|rity of my Native
Country, I turn an Eye to <HI>my own Po&s;terity,</HI> my Heart is oppre&s;s'd,
with <HI>Grief,</HI> that is too heavy for my <HI>Glory.</HI>&mdash;I &s;ee <HI>You,</HI> my Son! rejecting all the Means of becoming able to protect, or
govern, what I <HI>leave</HI> you.&mdash;You will not &s;o much as hear of <HI>Warlike Study</HI>; tho' by <HI>that only</HI> we broke out of the
Ob&s;curity we were in|volv'd in; and made our&s;elves <HI>notic'd</HI> among
Nations.</P>
<P>I DO not exhort You to <HI>make War,</HI> with|out <HI>Rea&s;on</HI>;&mdash;I but pre&s;s you to learn the <HI>Art</HI> of it. I
cou'd place before your Eyes many <HI>Proofs,</HI> that this is nece&s;&s;ary:
But I will name the <HI>Greeks,</HI> only; for they are united in the &s;ame <HI>Faith,</HI> with us.&mdash;What, but Neglect of <HI>Arms,</HI> was the
Occa&s;ion of their Ruin? Re&s;t, and Idlene&s;s, had weaken'd them, till they
cou'd <HI>&s;ubmit,</HI> even to <HI>Slavery!</HI> You mi&s;take, if you think
it enough, for a Prince to have <HI>Good Generals.</HI> Men look up, to the <HI>Head:</HI> They examine <HI>his</HI> Inclinations, that they may conform
them&s;elves to his <HI>Genius.</HI>&mdash;My Brother, in his Reign, lov'd
Magnificence, in <HI>Dre&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;es.</HI> The Nation,
(<HI>before,</HI> not at all inclin'd that Way) form'd their Ta&s;te, upon
their <HI>Prince</HI>'s; for <PB N="158" REF="167"> they imitate <HI>us,</HI>
as well in our <HI>Good</HI> Quali|ties, as our <HI>Evil.</HI></P>
<P>YOU hate <HI>War:</HI>&mdash;You neglect it:&mdash;You will,
con&s;equently, never learn it.&mdash;<HI>How,</HI> then, can you <HI>command
others?</HI>&mdash;How <HI>judge,</HI> of the Rewards, which &s;hou'd encourage
the <HI>De&s;erving?</HI> or the Puni&s;hments, which mu&s;t be held out, to
the Eyes of the <HI>Unworthy?</HI>&mdash;You will &s;ee, and hear, for ever,
with the Eyes, and Ears, of <HI>others</HI>; and re&s;em|ble a young <HI>Bird,</HI> that holds out its <HI>Bill</HI> to its <HI>Feeder.</HI></P>
<P>I AM a <HI>Man,</HI> my Son, and I <HI>mu&s;t die.</HI>&mdash;To <HI>whom</HI> &s;hall I leave the Accompli&s;hment of my Labours? To <HI>whom</HI> &s;hall I commit the <HI>Protection</HI> of my <HI>People?</HI>&mdash;To one! who, like the <HI>&s;lothful Servant,</HI>
conceals, the Ta|lent, he &s;hou'd employ!&mdash;and falls back, from the
glorious <HI>Tru&s;t,</HI> which God has di&s;|tingui&s;h'd him by!</P>
<P>REMEMBER your long Ob&s;tinacy&mdash;and become generou&s;ly
a&s;ham'd, of this Perver&s;e|ne&s;s in your Nature.&mdash;How often have I
reproach'd You! Nay, &s;ometimes, you have compell'd my Affection even to <HI>puni&s;h</HI> you!&mdash;For &s;ome Years pa&s;t, I have &s;carce &s;poke
to you.&mdash;Yet, all this avail'd nothing.&mdash;It was <HI>lo&s;ing</HI> my <HI>Time!</HI>&mdash;It was <HI>&s;triking</HI> the <HI>Air!</HI>&mdash;All

Delight</HI>!&mdash;Nor <PB N="159" REF="168"> do you concern your&s;elf for
the Con&s;equen|ces, it may produce to your Country!</P>
<P>AFTER having weigh'd, in my &s;ecret Brea&s;t, the fatal Tendency

<P>THE <HI>Coquette,</HI> and <HI>Ned Volatile,</HI> have been Indulged
in their Propen&s;ities to talk, and, enjoyed their Humour and Plea&s;an|try;
nay, they have been permitted to break in upon one another, &s;ometimes, with
unex|pected Vollies of Raillery, which might, per|haps, have been carried to
unwarrantable Lengths, and attended with ill Con&s;equences, if they had not
been over-awed by the Pre&s;ence of us, of a more &s;edate Turn; and
&s;ometimes, &s;ea&s;onably parted, by the Interpo&s;ition of the <HI>Major,</HI> and timely relieved from one another in tho&s;e brisk
On&s;ets.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="170">IF an Account of the little Infirmities of this
pair of Scufflers has had its proper Tendency towards the Cure of any <HI>noted
Impertinents,</HI> of either Sex, who have a Flux in their Tongues, I &s;hall
not think that I have as yet offended the Gravity of my Character, or lo&s;t
any Time, in penning down &s;uch Levities, the Know|ledge of which, rightly
convey'd, produces Con&s;equences of &s;o much Importance to the Quiet and
Repo&s;e of the more &s;erious part of the Human Species. Thus far I can &s;ay,
from what has fallen within my own Ob&s;ervation, That &s;everal gay Parts,
which I have di&s;|cover'd, of the Conver&s;ation between <HI>Ned</HI> and the <HI>Coquette,</HI> have excited an unu&s;ual Vein of Merriment among many of my
young Readers; but, tho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I had a &s;ecret <HI>Plea|&s;ure</HI> in finding them <HI>plea&s;ed</HI>; I &s;hould have been
delighted, in a more exqui&s;ite Degree, if my Writings, taking a better
Effect, had &s;tir'd up, in &s;ome of them, whom it wou'd have become, a little
more <HI>Self-Reflection,</HI> and <HI>le&s;s Laughter.</HI> They who only
laugh at the Follies of others, give me the wor&s;t half of their Ap|plau&s;e;
I &s;hall never be compleatly pleas'd, till I can teach them to laugh at
them&s;elves: they think me a plea&s;ant and facetious old Fellow, but I wou'd
be, at the &s;ame Time, a u&s;eful and a profitable Companion.</P>
<P>I LATELY &s;aw the mo&s;t penetrating pair of Eyes that ever &s;hone
upon Paper, very bu&s;ily employed upon that <HI>Plain-Dealer,</HI> wherein I
de&s;cribed the la&s;t Tongue-Skirmi&s;h, between <PB N="162" REF="171"> the <HI>Two Talkatives</HI> of our <HI>A&s;&s;embly.</HI> She read it to her&s;elf,
and ever, now and then, laugh'd out heartily. I could gue&s;s, by ob&s;erving
her Eye, what Pa&s;&s;ages tickled her the mo&s;t, and found 'em to be tho&s;e,
which threw the for|ward Humour of the two Combatants into the &s;tronge&s;t
Pitch of Ridicule. I was in hopes, That, if any of that Female Infirmity, which
&s;he &s;o heartily laugh'd at in others, fell to her Share, &s;he would ever
after carefully avoid appearing in the &s;ame Light, in which &s;he had &s;een
her Neighbour make &s;o ungraceful a Figure, and whom &s;he confe&s;s'd, by
&s;uch <HI>&s;en|&s;ible Signs,</HI> to be a proper Object of Ridicule. But, to
my very great Wonder, &s;he no &s;ooner laid the Paper out of her Hands, but
&s;he in|continently exerci&s;ed tho&s;e Lips, with ten times more Velocity in <HI>Talking,</HI> than they &s;eem'd to have in the <HI>Cour&s;e</HI> of their <HI>Reading.</HI> Her Tongue out-gallop'd the <HI>Coquette</HI>'s; and I am
per&s;uaded, if <HI>Ned Volatile</HI> had been to &s;tart with her upon equal
Terms, &s;he would fairly have di&s;tanced <HI>him</HI>; he would have lo&s;t
Sight of her in the fir&s;t Flight: Up got I, (no Room being given to take
Leave) and march|ed off, as fa&s;t as my Oaken-&s;tick would help me; and have
been mightily di&s;couraged, to &s;ee the little Effects of my
Performances.&mdash;I warrant this Go&s;&s;ip, told the next Company &s;he fell
into, That &s;he read my <HI>Paper,</HI> and the Moment after, in utter
Contempt of the Moral palpably contained in it, bolted away into numberle&s;s
Fooleries, and as many Imperti|nences <PB N="163" REF="172"> as before. But can
this pert Fair-One be properly &s;aid to have <HI>read</HI> the PLAIN-DEALER?
No, &s;he <HI>&s;aw</HI> it, but did not <HI>read</HI> it. At this Rate I
mu&s;t be obliged to turn <HI>Lecturer</HI> upon my own Works, and where there
are any genteel Hints, &s;ub&s;titute rougher, and coar&s;er, in their Room,
that they may not be too deli|cate, and e&s;cape Ob&s;ervation. It is the Sign
of a well-manner'd Writer, ju&s;t to touch upon the Verge of a &s;evere Truth,
and leave the re&s;t to a Reader's private Meditation. But if this Method
proves ineffectual, it is next to impo&s;|&s;ible, to pre&s;erve the Character
of a PLAIN-DEALER, without &s;aying &s;omething that may penetrate, more
violently. I &s;hall, therefore for the Future, without Scruple, declare, that
any Eyes, let them appear never &s;o beautiful, which at once look over, and
overlook, the&s;e Papers, are in a Manner as bad as blind; and that the only
Grace in beautiful Lips, which are almo&s;t always in Motion, and &s;carce ever
to the Purpo&s;e, con&s;i&s;ts in the Propriety of their Colour, which &s;hews,
as if they blu&s;h'd, with a Sen&s;e of their own Impertinence.</P>
<P>THE Gentlemen run over my Papers, as well as the Ladies, without
reading them. They conceive a Je&s;t on &s;ome particular Per|&s;on, then
laugh; and become more a Je&s;t them&s;elves: yet will not con&s;ider, till
they are told in plain Terms, that each of them is that <HI>particular
Per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>THE odd Spark, whom my Corre&s;pondent, fair <HI>Cleora,</HI> very
properly liken'd to a <HI>Mercury</HI> <PB N="164" REF="173"> <HI>Rever&s;ed,</HI> is the &s;ame odd Spark he was, and, what is wor&s;e, has
&s;ince that Time brought over Hundreds of Pro&s;elytes, to the &s;ame &s;illy
Fa&s;hion; &s;o that one would be apt to imagine, there is nothing more
wanting, to make a Dre&s;s very popular, but &s;hewing it fir&s;t to be very
ridiculous. There &s;eems to be a general Emulation among the
Fa&s;hion-Mongers, which of them can be the mo&s;t Whim&s;ical, as the on|ly
&s;ure Way to be the mo&s;t Taking and Suc|ce&s;sful.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>Mercuries</HI> con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly of your Sma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t, Dapper Blades; tho' &s;ome very tall
Men have conde&s;cended to come into the Fa|&s;hion, which makes them appear to
have no Heads at all, or as if half the Head, lay hid in the Bag behind it.</P>
<P>IT is an extraordinary Entertainment to &s;ee the whole <HI>Mall</HI>
crowded with this kind of Pup|pets; and yet more &s;o, when examining the&s;e
Childi&s;h Figures, you read in their Faces, that they generally con&s;i&s;t of
Per&s;ons from Five and Twenty, to upwards of Forty Years of Age. Some Fops of
Fifty-odd, make the fir&s;t Decays of Age remarkable in them by this Dre&s;s,
which would be otherwi&s;e unnoticed. A jolly old Friend of mine, was taking an
Airing with me in the Park the other Day, 
<Q REND="inline">'What mu&s;t be in the&s;e Peoples Minds, <HI>&s;aid
he,</HI> that, in order to look Gay, appear Hoary, like the Pictures of <HI>Old
Winter,</HI> when every Thing looks flouri&s;hing about them? The very Breezes
blow to refre&s;h them, and &s;weep <PB N="165" REF="174"> away the Load of
Du&s;t, which wou'd &s;wel|ter them if they had not ingeniou&s;ly prevent|ed
it, by a Cement of Orange-Butter.</Q></P>
<P>CAN any of the&s;e Sparks <HI>pretend</HI> to read my Papers; who,
without looking into their Minds, continue to cultivate the Out&s;ide of their
Heads after &s;uch a prodigious and pre|po&s;terous Rate! As to the Powderers
of Fifty, I mu&s;t tell them, that even I, who am in my grand Climacterick, and
have gone thro' the Snow of &s;o many Winters, am not half &s;o much powder'd
as they, and that therefore it cannot look decent in them.</P>
<P>IF we &s;urvey from the Head downwards, every Part of their Dre&s;s,
there is not one, but what is prepo&s;terous.</P>
<P>IF a Man, for Example, was to take a Re|view of the Officers and
Soldiers, provided they had Sleeves of the Modern Cut, he would take them for
an Army of Invalids. The Company of <HI>Taylors</HI> &s;eem to have forgot
them|&s;elves, and want the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Barber-Surgeons,</HI>
to in&s;truct them in the Rules of Ana|tomy, without which, the Elbows of Men
are vi&s;ibly out of Joint, and can never be &s;et cle|verly.</P>
<P>THE young Fellows have drop'd down the Flaps of their Coats, very near
as Low as the Clocks of their Stockings, &s;o that &s;carce any thing of the
Leg is to be &s;een but Ancle; and they &s;eem to be pulling them &s;till lower
and lower, that they may be more and more like Petticoats, which the Women are,
grate|fully, <PB N="166" REF="175"> tucking up &s;horter and &s;horter, that
there will be a decent Nece&s;&s;ity for converting them into <HI>Breeches.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I ob&s;erve, that the Ladies go open-brea&s;ted in <HI>Winter,</HI> tho' the Dappers button up to the Chin in <HI>Summer</HI>; and
have garni&s;hed the Folds of their Coats with Supernumerary Buttons, the U&s;e
of which I cannot po&s;&s;ibly learn, tho' I have applied to tho&s;e who are
very deeply read. I would propo&s;e Buttons and Button-holes down the Seam of
the Back, that they may be button'd up to the Poll, as they are to the Chin,
which will be of great U&s;e, when, they are lazy; for they may be unbutton|ed,
as Ladies are unlac'd, <HI>behind,</HI> by a Servant.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e Alterations &s;hould be carried on a little further, my
Friend <HI>Gunter</HI>'s Predictions, concerning the Mutation of Sexes, mu&s;t
be al|lowed to be punctually verified.</P>
<P>WHAT I mo&s;t fear is, le&s;t our Merchants and others, who&s;e
Affairs have kept them ma|ny Years beyond Sea, &s;hou'd be &s;urprized, at
their Return, to find us dre&s;s'd after the pre|&s;ent Mode, hear our Officers
&s;ing <HI>Italian,</HI> our Beaus compliment one another in <HI>High
Dutch,</HI> our old Women talk Politicks in <HI>French,</HI> and not believe us
to be the &s;ame Generation of Peo|ple, they left behind them in this
I&s;land.</P>

Ca&s;t of Thought, who know, that, as <HI>Truth</HI> is the only Mean, by which <HI>Divines</HI> can &s;urely in&s;truct, &s;o their <HI>Stile</HI> mu&s;t be
peculiarly clear, which, without &s;topping at <HI>Brightne&s;s,</HI> pur&s;ues <HI>Solidity.</HI> I am therefore fully &s;atisfy'd, that, that Grave Cla&s;s
of my <HI>Readers,</HI> whom I count doing me an Honour, when I &s;ee them clap
on their Spectacles to read my <HI>Works,</HI> as if they thought they could
meet with Improvement from them, after their <PB N="168" REF="177"> own long
Experience of the <HI>World,</HI> will be plea&s;ed with the following <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> which the <HI>Clergyman</HI> made, the other Day, upon
that <HI>Virtue</HI> call'd <HI>Plain-Dealing.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider that every Body, &s;aid he, is continually
recommending the <HI>Subject</HI> of your <HI>Papers</HI> in common
Conver&s;ation, one would think there was little need for a Writer to employ
his Time upon it: But when we reflect how few practi&s;e it, <HI>no
Subject</HI> requires more <HI>Pains</HI> to inforce it. People prai&s;e it
every <HI>Day,</HI> and violate it every <HI>Hour,</HI> and <HI>common
Hone&s;ty,</HI> like <HI>common Sen&s;e,</HI> is boldly pretended to by <HI>every Body,</HI> but really po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>few.</HI></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be worth a little of our <HI>Meditation</HI> to inform
our&s;elves, how this <HI>Quality</HI> comes to be &s;o Valuable among us, and
yet we &s;o frequently and &s;o ea&s;ily part with it; in &s;hort, by what <HI>My&s;tery</HI> in our <HI>Conduct</HI> &s;uch Numbers of Men, would appear
to be what they are not.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee upon the fir&s;t Moment's Reflection, that PLAIN-DEALING is
the <HI>Soul</HI> of <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI>; it is the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of it; and, when that is once gone, the mo&s;t warm and
lively <HI>In|timacies</HI> can no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t: They grow cold and dye
at once. Now <HI>Friend&s;hips,</HI> we all know, are the very Bonds of <HI>Society</HI>; again, we as clearly comprehend, that what we call, a <HI>Good Under&s;tanding,</HI> among publick Bodies of Men, (which cannot be
maintained but by <HI>Fair-Dealings</HI>) is the Prop and Support of every
Civilized <HI>Government.</HI> Since we are &s;o <PB N="169" REF="178"> &s;oon
and &s;o perfectly convinced, that <HI>Plain-Dealing</HI> carries along with it
&s;uch Advantages, it is no wonder, that we &s;hould de&s;ire to be reckoned
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of &s;o valuable a <HI>Good.</HI> It is Natural for us
to de&s;ire it; it is in this Sen&s;e &s;carce a Vertue; for, morally
&s;peaking, it is what we cannot help de&s;iring. Every Mortal breathing has
felt the fir&s;t Principles of <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> very &s;trong in his Heart;
and even he that departed from it, knows his Struggle was very great. It is the
Quality he covets to find in every one with whom he conver&s;es, and he
&s;ecretly adores the Man in whom he hap|pens to meet it.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, if <HI>Plain-Dealing</HI> had not all the&s;e
attractive <HI>Charms,</HI> yet there is &s;omething &s;o ridiculous and
unpopular in play|ing the Double upon Mankind; there is &s;uch a Ba&s;ene&s;s
in the doing of it, &s;uch an Impo&s;&s;i|bility of doing it often without
being di&s;cover|ed; &s;uch an irretrievable Ignominy, &s;uch a quick and
painful Remor&s;e, that a <HI>Life</HI> of Di&s;|&s;imulation is full enough of
Horror to fright Men from it, if a <HI>Life</HI> of Hone&s;ty had not Charms to
tempt, and invite us.</P>
<P>SURE then it is a Riddle, that we are not like the People we <HI>Love,</HI> but the People we <HI>Hate.</HI> The meane&s;t Slave cannot bear
to be called a Di&s;&s;embler, and yet the great|e&s;t Princes do not blu&s;h
to di&s;&s;emble. <HI>Qui ne&s;cit Di&s;&s;imulare, ne&s;cit Regnare,</HI> is
grown their Political Motto. State&s;men originally meant the &s;ame as <HI>Faithful</HI> Servants of a <HI>State</HI>; <PB N="170" REF="179"> they are
now adays called <HI>Politicians,</HI> and Politican is little more than a new
Name for <HI>Deceiver.</HI> Even Religious Per&s;ons have enter'd into a
Con&s;piracy again&s;t <HI>Plain-Dealing</HI>; Di&s;|&s;emblers, in Holy
Orders, have cau&s;ed, <HI>In ver|bo Sacerdoti,</HI> to &s;ignify a <HI>Fal&s;hood,</HI> and <HI>Nolo Epi&s;|copare</HI> to &s;tand for de&s;iring
earne&s;tly what a Man pretends to <HI>decline.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the whole it is nothing but Folly and Cowardice, that &s;educes
Men fir&s;t out of the plain Road of <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Vertue,</HI> into
the By-ways of <HI>Double-Dealing?</HI> and, when once <HI>Cunning</HI> took
the Place of <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> in Mens Minds, and <HI>Fear</HI> in&s;tead of
Re&s;olution govern'd their Hearts; they at length brought <HI>Double-Dealing</HI> (which was, at fir&s;t, a <HI>Crime,</HI> by <HI>Ac|cident</HI>) thro' a long and con&s;tant Habit, to be no le&s;s than an <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH a Duty as <HI>Plain-Dealing,</HI> cannot be too much known, and
nothing is learnt, more ea&s;ily; but then in a Corrupt Age nothing is &s;o
ea&s;ily lo&s;t: in a depraved and impious Com|pany, nothing is &s;o readily
parted from.</P>
<P>THE Clergy have a Right to diffu&s;e among the People this Spirit of
Hone&s;ty, by Precept, and a more particular Duty, incumbent upon them, to
enforce it by Example. But too many among them have &s;uch a Ta&s;te for
world|ly Intere&s;t, as to have lo&s;t the Reli&s;h of Primi|tive Religion; and
while they profe&s;s them|&s;elves <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> appear a&s;hamed, to be
thought Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="180">AS there is nothing nobler than a good Prie&s;t;
&s;o there is nothing &s;o &s;hocking and ri|diculous, as to &s;ee a ba&s;e Man
of that Profe&s;|&s;ion, which annexes Reverend to his Name. A Layman, that
does not reverence a good Pa&s;tor, is a Profligate: But a wicked Man, in holy
Orders, is a Mon&s;ter. The Ancients, when they drew the Pictures of Beauty and
Ugline&s;s, took Pieces from &s;everal Objects, the better to compleat their
De&s;ign. In order to excite true Horror again&s;t wicked Prelates I &s;hall
u&s;e the &s;ame Liberty, and draw from the wickede&s;t, I have heard of, a
kind of Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Caligula,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;e him to be a
Bi&s;hop, to give him the Fulne&s;s of his Deformity: I &s;hall then give the
Sketch of a virtuous Eccle|&s;ia&s;tick; but mu&s;t remark, for the Honour of
Prie&s;thood, that the ill Character is compound|ed of a great many <HI>Double-Dealers,</HI> and that the good one, did really belong to one good
Man.</P>
<P><HI>UMBRA</HI> was always a great Pretender to Virtue and Piety, but
never Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Com|mon Hone&s;ty: He made Godline&s;s his Gain, and
never e&s;pou&s;ed the Intere&s;ts of Virtue, but with the View of pu&s;hing
his own. <HI>Umbra</HI> cant|ed inordinately; but never once pray'd hearti|ly.
In order to ingratiate him&s;elf with great Families, he applied him&s;elf to
learn a fal&s;e kind of Oratory, and grew a famed Panegy|ri&s;t, and Compo&s;er
of Funeral Sermons, in which he would &s;alve up the Vices of great Men, in
favour of Death-bed Repentance; <PB N="172" REF="181"> and demon&s;trate very
elaborately, how the Virtue of a Moment, could atone the Impiety of an Age. If
he dined at a Nobleman's Table, he &s;aid a &s;canty Grace to a full Meal, and
would ju&s;t dip down his Head to the great Author, who multiplies Food for the
U&s;e and Benefit of his Creatures; but, before he &s;eated him&s;elf, would
make a profound Reverence to the Debauchee that entertain'd him. When he grew,
by the&s;e Means, acquainted with great Men, he turn'd Politician, and rai&s;ed
him&s;elf up on the blind Side of one, by &s;etting him at Variance with
another: He next became a State Preacher, and changed his Note as the Times
changed, &s;o that there were many Ser|mons of his, direct Contradictions to
each other. He &s;old the Go&s;pel by Retale, and lived long in Grandeur, by
deba&s;ing Chri&s;tianity: he has &s;ometimes taken Delight in abu&s;ing the
very Prie&s;thood, and triumph'd in a Bi&s;hoprick, when he de&s;erv'd to be
excommunicated. Thus ve&s;ted, unhappily, with Prelatical Autho|rity, he would
ruin his hone&s;t Inferiors, and if they &s;ought Ju&s;tice, terrify them by
his Pri|vilege. This <HI>Double-Dealer,</HI> with a Mitre on his Head, lived
prevaricating for many Years, and then died as he lived, leaving &s;uch
Fal&s;|hoods under his Hand on his Death-bed, as if the Mea&s;ure of his Days
had been too &s;hort for his Prevarication.</P>
<P>THERE was &s;uch a Per&s;on lately living as <HI>Cordatus,</HI> who
had an honourable Po&s;t in the Church. He belong'd to a great Cathedral, 
<PB N="173" REF="182"> and was really a Per&s;on of Quality; joining the
Gentleman with the Chri&s;tian, he was both Religious and Polite. He had this
peculiar Felicity in his Temper, that, though he lived in an Age of Faction, he
judged many, of a different Opinion from him&s;elf, to be hone&s;t and
well-meaning Men, and, by treating them as &s;uch, won them over to his
Opinion. He never u&s;ed his Authority but to quiet Animo&s;i|ties, to make or
renew Friend&s;hips, and to e&s;tabli&s;h Peace, good Will, and Union. He was
learned and wi&s;e, and tho' he had an Im|pediment in his Speech, he preached
clearly to the Under&s;tanding. He never cho&s;e that Oratory, which tends more
to nouri&s;h Pride in the Speaker, than to in&s;til Virtue into the Hearer. He
knew it his Duty to in&s;truct the Ignorant, and therefore &s;tudied
Per&s;picuity, in all that he deliver'd from the Pulpit. He made Virtue the
Study of one part of his Life, and the other was taken up with the Labour of
communicating what he had learnt, for the U&s;e and In&s;truction of others. He
never con|cealed any thing that might make other Men better; &s;ave one, and
that was his Charity. All knew he recommended what he acted, and finding the
Preacher in earne&s;t, the Hearers were &s;o too. Nothing among <HI>his</HI>
Pari&s;hioners, was deliver'd over to Shame, but Impiety. He lived thus for
many Years a general Ble&s;&s;ing, and his Death was a Common Calamity. The
Poor lo&s;t a Benefactor, the Rich a valuable <PB N="174" REF="183"> Friend,
and every individual Man of his Ac|quaintance, an exemplary Companion.</P>
<P>I MUST, before I conclude, advi&s;e all Cler|gymen not to fix any
Parts in the De&s;cription of <HI>Umbra,</HI> upon any particular Per&s;ons
they may not think well of; becau&s;e that will be &s;hewing, they have &s;ome
of his Spirit: Let them rather &s;tudy to live like <HI>Cordatus,</HI> that
they may die with his Character. What &s;igni|fies finding out who is meant by <HI>Umbra,</HI> or who is <HI>Cordatus?</HI> The profitable Search will be to
examine what Parts they have acted like <HI>Umbra,</HI> and amend them; and, in
what they have per&s;onated <HI>Cordatus,</HI> and improve them: If they do
otherwi&s;e, they will imitate the Dog in the Fable, and, by catching at the
Shadow, lo&s;e the Sub&s;tance of my Di&s;&s;ertation.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Old Favourite!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW little did I think, when you pro|fe&s;s'd your&s;elf a PLAIN
DEALER, that you wou'd, &s;o &s;oon, become a <HI>Tatler!</HI> Pray don't
mi&s;take this, for a <HI>Compliment:</HI> I am not in &s;o obliging a Humour,
I a&s;&s;ure you. I find, Men mu&s;t be <HI>cautious,</HI> when they keep
communicative Company: For there are a kind of Talkative old Gentlemen, who
never know when to have done, with their Acquaintance; but will carry a Man
about <PB N="176" REF="185"> with 'em, for half an Age after his Funeral:
However to go, at once, into my Matter.</P>
<P>I HAVE a very particular Regard for <HI>Sir Portly Rufus:</HI> Nor
do his Commands want their due Weight with me. But, as a cer|tain Poet,
&s;omewhere expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, 
<Q> 
<L>All Duties mu&s;t to Self-Defence give Way;</L> 
<L>For injur'd Honour cannot brook Delay.</L> </Q> </P>
<P>LET the Ladies, therefore <HI>wait,</HI> for their Swan-skin
Breeches. My Mu&s;e may, per|haps, be at Lei&s;ure, again&s;t Winter: And none,
but a ha&s;ty <HI>Prude</HI> or two, can want 'em, this warm Weather. So, I
&s;hall have Time to &s;tand ju&s;tify'd, again&s;t your fal&s;e Accu&s;ation, <HI>That I &s;tudy nothing, but Poetry. Tom Tire&s;ome,</HI> a heavy Blockhead!
can talk of nothing but the Stocks! But Mr. <HI>Juniper</HI> is a Man of
Learning; let <HI>him</HI> &s;peak of me, from his own Knowledge. Or I might
ap|peal to <HI>Will Weathercock,</HI> (again&s;t whom I often maintain
Arguments) whether there is any Truth in your Accu&s;ation? But, as an|other
Poet &s;ays, upon &s;ome Occa&s;ion or other, in &s;ome Place that I have
forgot, 
<Q> 
<L>In vain are Toothle&s;s Satires writ</L> 
<L>'Gain&s;t him, who <HI>feels</HI> him&s;elf a Wit.</L> </Q> </P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;corn to owe my Vindication to any Hand but my own: And
hope to convince <PB N="177" REF="186"> you, before I end this Letter, <HI>That
I have more in me than Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>PRAY, who taught you in the fir&s;t Place to be <HI>Witty</HI> upon
your Friends, before you cou'd Spell their <HI>Names</HI> right? All the Men of
Erudition, who have been numerous among the <HI>Jyngles,</HI> wrote
them&s;elves with an j <HI>Con&s;onant:</HI> A &s;oft and &s;hapely Letter!
Which you have barbarou&s;ly demoli&s;h'd; and built up, in the Place of it, a
broad|back'd, <HI>Gothick</HI> G: A rough, and choaking, <HI>Guttural!</HI>
that is &s;carce fit for any Thing, but to gargle a <HI>German</HI>'s Throat
with! Every <HI>Graduate,</HI> (duce take this G!) Every <HI>Stu|dent,</HI> in <HI>Orthography,</HI> knows the manife&s;t Difference, between <HI>Jyngle</HI>
and <HI>Gingle!</HI> what tho' <HI>Jilt</HI> &s;ounds like <HI>Gentlewoman,</HI> and <HI>Jackanapes</HI> like <HI>Ginger-bread!</HI> If
our Lan|guage is a Double-Dealer, and for want of &s;ettled U&s;age, and a
limited Acceptation, gives Encouragement to idle People to run Divi&s;ions on
the <HI>Alphabet</HI>; that is nothing to <HI>me.</HI> All I mean by it, is, to
convince you, that I under&s;tand <HI>&s;omething,</HI> be&s;ides Poetry.</P>
<P>THIS, however, <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant</HI> only, for I am Ma&s;ter of <HI>better</HI> Sciences; &s;uch as are new, even in <HI>Theory.</HI> But, not
to triumph, too much, over the Mi&s;take of a Friend, (&s;ince it is a very
common Error to think too meanly, of the Merit we are familiar with) I will
open upon this Occa&s;ion, but <HI>one Vein</HI> of my Skill; and let it flow
to your Shame, till it &s;hall be &s;topt, by your Conviction.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="187"> I AM, you mu&s;t know, then, a kind of <HI>im|material Anatomi&s;t:</HI> I can di&s;&s;ect an <HI>Imagina|tion</HI>;
or di&s;embowel a <HI>Quality:</HI> I am about to make publick Profe&s;&s;ion
of my Art: And having my <HI>Chariot</HI> as good as ready, the re&s;t of my <HI>Apparatus</HI> will be, comparatively, of no Con&s;equence. I &s;hall <HI>drive</HI> fa&s;t into <HI>Practice.</HI> But the chief Scruple I labour
under, is, by what Title to di&s;tingui&s;h my|&s;elf: I wou'd make u&s;e of
the Word <HI>Doctor,</HI> but that the College of Phy&s;icians, who place much
Learning in <HI>Privilege,</HI> wou'd have me a&s;cend, by <HI>Degrees,</HI> to
that Dignity: Which is too phlegmatic a Pre&s;cription to agree with my Temper.
I am, therefore, inclina|ble, &s;ince very much of my Practice will lie among
the Ladies, to call my&s;elf a <HI>Mind-Midwife:</HI> In&s;inuating, by that
Hint, That I can &s;ee 'em as &s;afely brought to Bed of their <HI>Affectation,</HI> and other <HI>&s;piritual Conceptions,</HI> as they can

Brothers of my Pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Patient I propo&s;e to <HI>lay,</HI> is a pregnant <HI>Male</HI> Member of that learned <HI>College</HI> I was mentioning. To be a <HI>Doctor</HI>'s <HI>Doctor,</HI> is, to cure, in the be&s;t Light
po&s;&s;ible: And I wou'd emulate the Example of that me|morable Magician, <HI>Zyto,</HI> who was &s;ent for, &s;ays a <HI>grave</HI> Hi&s;torian, by the
Emperor <HI>Charles the</HI> IVth; to try his Skill, again&s;t a <HI>High
German Conjurer; Zyto,</HI> who was a <HI>White</HI> Wizard, and worth a
Hundred of your <PB N="179" REF="188"> <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI>'s; &s;tood, in
Pre&s;ence of the Emperor, and, with inflexible Compo&s;ure, ob&s;erv'd the
In&s;tances of his Rival's Art; who &s;wallow'd, at la&s;t, a burning
Hor&s;e-&s;hoe: And defy'd our <HI>Zyto,</HI> to do it after him. But <HI>Zyto</HI> cho&s;e, rather (that he might end the Di&s;pute, at a <HI>Mor&s;el</HI>) to &s;wallow the <HI>Conjurer him&s;elf!</HI> And expanding
his Mouth into horrible, and inhuman, Widene&s;s, &s;napt him up, like a
Radi&s;h! But, when he came to his dirty Shoes, and di&s;dain'd to &s;wallow
farther, he ran with him, to a Hor&s;e-pond, hard by; and launch'd him out into
the middle of it; to the no &s;mall Entertainment, and Satis|faction of the
Company.</P>
<P>THE Name of my future Patient, is <HI>Sir Clouterly Rumble:</HI> a
Profe&s;&s;or, of the <HI>Eque|&s;trian,</HI> as well as the <HI>Medicinal</HI>
Order. He car|ries, on his Countenance, the cleare&s;t Symp|toms of his
Grievance: Which is a Di&s;tem|per, that &s;ome moral Doctors have
di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd by the Name of <HI>Vanity.</HI> It operates, with mo&s;t
Violence, on the Head, and the Heart; tho' it affects the Limbs al&s;o: And,
&s;ometimes &s;wells the whole Frame, into the mo&s;t enormous <HI>Turgidity.</HI> It &s;hakes the <HI>Fin|gers</HI> of this afflicted
Gentleman, with a year|ly Convul&s;ion of the Nerves; during which Fits, it is
dangerous to let <HI>Paper</HI> lie in his way: For he applies him&s;elf, with
the wilde&s;t Ec&s;ta&s;y to &s;trike it over, at Random, with odd Lines,
crooked Cyphers, and Characters, wholly unintelligible! to the pitiful
Di&s;|quieting, <PB N="180" REF="189"> and Perplexity, of his Brain: Which,
becoming heated, <HI>praeter-naturally,</HI> by &s;uch extravagant Agitation,
inflames, and nouri&s;hes his Malady.</P>
<P>IT was a laudable Accompli&s;hment, that of calculating Di&s;tempers
by examining the Patient's <HI>Water!</HI> In Imitation of this good Cu&s;tom,
I poured out, before me, a large Quantity of the &s;ick Man's <HI>Pro&s;aic,</HI> and <HI>Poe|tic Emi&s;&s;ions</HI>; and upon in&s;pecting
the <HI>La|bel,</HI> annex'd to one of 'em which he ad|dre&s;&s;es, poor
Gentleman! to an Illu&s;trious young Prince in <HI>Germany,</HI> with as grave,
and &s;erious an Air, as if it was really, &s;ome|thing fit to be look'd upon!
I pre&s;ently di&s;covered both the Di&s;temper, and his pro|per Cure for it.
The <HI>Tokens,</HI> as far as I can remember, were Stronge&s;t, and mo&s;t

of <HI>Scrophulous</HI> Humours, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> call
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. But the Name the Patient

<Q>THE Glory of a People depending on the Ex|cellence of their King,

<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING ob&s;erv'd, That my <HI>Extract</HI> of the CZAR of <HI>RUSSIA</HI>'s <HI>Letter to his SON,</HI> which you publi&s;h'd in your 
<PB N="186" REF="195"> 20th Paper, gave a very great Surprize to the Generality
of your Readers, who had form'd, upon common Rumour, an Opinion of that
Prince's Death, extremely different from the Truth; I now &s;end you as brief
an Ab&s;tract as po&s;&s;ible, from a Relation, which was pub|li&s;h'd in <HI>High Dutch,</HI> by the Mini&s;ter of a <HI>German Court,</HI> not likely
to be partial in Favour of the <HI>Czar,</HI> and who was pre&s;ent, and an
Eye-Witne&s;s of the Facts, which he publi&s;hes.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> had long inclin'd to ally him|&s;elf with &s;ome
powerful Family of <HI>Germany,</HI> by the Marriage of his Son; whom he hop'd
to reclaim from his Indolence, by the Conver|&s;ation of a Prince&s;s of high
Extraction, and a noble Education: For this Prince had, by a continual
a&s;&s;ociating him&s;elf with the vile&s;t Company, contracted &s;uch corrupt
Habits, as could not fail of producing an Aver&s;ion to him, in all hone&s;t
Minds. He was &s;o far &s;unk in Sen&s;uality, that no Repre&s;entations, no
Pains, could recover him: So that the <HI>Czar,</HI> being, at length, by his
Son's perver&s;e Con|duct, almo&s;t brought to an Abhorrence of his Per&s;on,
began to drop Intimations, That he wou'd cau&s;e him to be &s;hav'd for a Monk,
and &s;hut him up in a Convent.&mdash;The Prince's own Favourites were alarm'd
at the Danger; and earne&s;tly entreated him to have his Wel|fare at Heart; and
to conceal, if he cou'd not &s;uppre&s;s, his rigorous Hatred again&s;t
Foreigners. This di&s;pos'd him to fall in with <PB N="187" REF="196"> the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Propo&s;ition, and he was married, as is well known, to a
Prince&s;s, of the Family of <HI>Brun&s;wick Wolfenbuttel,</HI> and Si&s;ter to
the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT, after he had brought her to <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> he &s;hew'd
not the lea&s;t Complai&s;ance; nor endeavour'd, at all, to divert
her.&mdash;On the contrary, I ob&s;erv'd, That, on all Publick Occa&s;ions, he
never exchang'd a Word with her; but, indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;hun'd her Company.
The Prince had the Apartments of the right Wing; and the Prince&s;s tho&s;e of
the Left: But they &s;aw each other &s;carce once a Week; and, had not the
Prince con&s;ider'd the beget|ting an Heir, as the Support of his own Safety,
he would have made him&s;elf intirely invi&s;ible to her. He even neglected the
Repair of the Hou&s;e, to that Degree, that the Prince&s;s lay expos'd to the
Injuries of the Air, and Wea|ther, in her own Bedchamber.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Czar</HI> expo&s;tulated with him, concerning the&s;e
Proceedings, he loaded <HI>her</HI> with Reproaches, as if it was &s;he, who
had accus'd him; whereas, that wi&s;e Prince&s;s &s;ub|mitted to her hard Fate,
with the firme&s;t Con|&s;tancy and Re&s;ignation; nor had any other
Witne&s;&s;es of her Tears, but the Prince&s;s of <HI>Ea&s;t-Frei&s;land,</HI>
her Companion, and the Walls of her own Apartment. She liv'd, four Years, in
this Manner, and was then &s;eiz'd with an Indi&s;po&s;ition, &s;o dangerous,
that her Recovery was immediately de&s;pair'd of.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="197">WHEN &s;he perceiv'd her End approaching,
&s;he de&s;ir'd to &s;ee the <HI>Czar,</HI> who was, at the &s;ame Time,
indi&s;pos'd: But he caus'd him&s;elf to be carry'd to her, in a Machine, mov'd
on Wheels.&mdash;The Prince&s;s took her Leave of him, in the mo&s;t moving
Expre&s;&s;ions; and recommended her two Children to his Care and Protection;
embracing them, in the mo&s;t ten|der manner po&s;&s;ible; and almo&s;t melting
away in Tears. Then, &s;he &s;ent for her Servants, who, to the Number of two
hundred Per&s;ons, and upwards, lay pro&s;trate, in the Anti-cham|ber,
imploring Heaven to a&s;&s;i&s;t their dying Mi&s;tre&s;s, in her la&s;t
Agonies.&mdash;She comforted, admoni&s;hed, and gave them her
Ble&s;&s;ing:&mdash;The Phy&s;icians would &s;till be pre&s;&s;ing her, to take
&s;ome Medicines; but &s;he threw the Gla&s;&s;es from her, crying out, with
great Emotion,&mdash;<HI>Do not torture me any more.&mdash;Permit me to die in
quiet.&mdash;For I am re&s;olved to live no longer.</HI>&mdash;She expir'd, in
fervent Prayer, and depart|ed an unfortunate Life, before &s;he was quite one
and twenty Years old.</P>
<P>IT was &s;oon after the Funeral of this Prin|ce&s;s, that the <HI>Czar</HI> gave that admirable Letter, which you publi&s;h'd in a late
PAPER, into the Hands of his Son. And, what follows, is the <HI>unequal</HI>

</LETTER>
<P>MANY further Attempts the <HI>Czar</HI> made, on his Son's
Ob&s;tinacy: But the Con&s;equence of them all; and of his pretended
Re&s;ignation, was his Flight to a Foreign Protection, and a plunging him&s;elf
into tho&s;e High Crimes which are particulariz'd, in his Sentence.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar,</HI> upon this extraordinary and me|lancholy
Occa&s;ion, convok'd a High Court of Ju&s;tice; con&s;i&s;ting of all the <HI>Chief</HI> of the <HI>States.</HI> <PB N="190" REF="199">&mdash;He lay, for
eight Days, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, many Hours, on his Knees; imploring God, with
Tears, to in&s;pire him with Sentiments, becom|ing his double Duty&mdash;as a <HI>Monarch,</HI> and as a <HI>Father.</HI>&mdash;The Prince was brought into
Court, under Guard of four Officers; and pro|ceeded again&s;t, in a Manner too
tedious, and circum&s;tantial, to be particulariz'd in &s;o &s;hort a
Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Court, upon the whole, having pro|nounc'd a formal Sentence, and
condemn'd the Prince to Death, the violent Surprize and Ter|ror of his Mind,
and the di&s;orderly Conflict and Fluctuation of his Pa&s;&s;ions, threw him
into an Apoplectick Fit. The <HI>Czar</HI> no &s;ooner heard, that he was in
this Danger, and that he was de&s;irous to &s;ee him, but he vi&s;ited his
dy|ing Son, with the mo&s;t vi&s;ible Marks of Pity, and a Proof of Paternal
Tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Prince, at Sight of his Father, bur&s;t out into Tears; and,
with Hands, rais'd, and folded, &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'He had grievou&s;ly offended the Maje&s;ty of
Almighty God, and the Good|ne&s;s of the <HI>Czar</HI>&mdash;; that he had not
even a Wi&s;h, to recover from his Indi&s;po&s;ition, be|ing unworthy to live
longer. He begg'd his Maje&s;ty, for God's &s;ake, only to take from him the
Cur&s;e, he had laid on him, at <HI>Moskow:</HI> to forgive him all his heavy
Crimes; to impart him his Ble&s;&s;ing; and, to cau&s;e Prayers to be put up
for his Soul.</Q></P>
<P>DURING the&s;e moving Words, the <HI>Czar,</HI> and the whole Court,
almo&s;t melted away, in <PB N="191" REF="200"> Tears.&mdash;His Maje&s;ty
return'd him a mo&s;t no|ble, and pathetic, An&s;wer: He repre&s;ented, in a
few, of the milde&s;t Words, he cou'd &s;elect, all his <HI>Length</HI> of
Offences; and then, gave him, in the mo&s;t touching Manner po&s;&s;ible, his
For|givene&s;s, and his Ble&s;&s;ing: After which, they parted, with abundance
of Tears, and La|mentations, on both Sides.</P>
<P>VERY late, in the Night, came a Me&s;&s;en|ger to acquaint the <HI>Czar,</HI> that the Prince was extremely de&s;irous, once more, to &s;ee
his Fa|ther. And his Maje&s;ty had ju&s;t &s;tept into his Sloop, to go over to
the Fortre&s;s, when ano|ther Me&s;&s;enger brought News, that the Prince was
already expir'd.&mdash;He was depo&s;ited in the new Burying-Vault, of the <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Family; and plac'd next the Coffin of his late
Con&s;ort.&mdash;The <HI>Czar,</HI> among the Mourners, carried a lighted
Wax-Taper, in his Hand; and was ob&s;erv'd to be bath'd in Tears, during the
Pro|ce&s;&s;ion; and, in particular, at the Church Ser|vice; where the Prie&s;t
had cho&s;e, for the Text of his Funeral Sermon, the&s;e Words of the mournful <HI>David,&mdash;O! my Son Ab&s;alom!&mdash;my Son!&mdash;my Son,
Ab&s;alom!</HI></P>
<P>YOU &s;ee, Sir! how different this Great Monarch's Conduct, in &s;o
nice, and trying, a Circum&s;tance, really was, from the Clouds, which <HI>Rumour</HI> blew upon it, to &s;hade, and blacken, an <HI>unequal'd
Character!</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Roman Fiercene&s;s</HI> has been <HI>celebrated,</HI> in Men, who not only <HI>condemn'd</HI> their Sons; but
&s;tood by, and <HI>&s;aw</HI> 'em executed, in the mo&s;t &s;evere, 
<PB N="192" REF="201"> and &s;hameful Manner, for the Love and Safe|ty of their
Country. Yet there was a <HI>Brutal Inflexibility,</HI> and a kind of <HI>Politic Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> in the Actions of tho&s;e <HI>Roman
Fathers!</HI> But this prodigious, <HI>modern,</HI> Prince, under no In|fluence
of Fear, Dependence, or Obligation, <HI>cho&s;e,</HI> to &s;et a&s;ide his <HI>own Blood,</HI> for the future Glory of his <HI>People!</HI> Only, with
this fine Dif|ference from the <HI>Roman,</HI> that, what was, <HI>there,</HI>
done, with a <HI>Stoici&s;m,</HI> that gave Su&s;picion of In&s;en&s;ibility,
was, <HI>here,</HI> adorn'd with <HI>Pity,</HI> and the mo&s;t manife&s;t
Strugglings of an amia|ble <HI>Weakne&s;s,</HI> that convinc'd his Subjects how <HI>Dear</HI> their Pro&s;perity mu&s;t be, to a Sovereign, who cou'd thus
provide for it, by a Sacrifice, again&s;t his Nature, even of his private, and
dome&s;tick, Comfort!</P>
<P>HAVING &s;hewn, in the foregoing In&s;tances, the <HI>afflicted</HI>
Side of the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Behaviour: It is but ju&s;t, that I &s;hou'd change
the Light, and &s;urprize you, by a View of that un&s;haken <HI>Firmne&s;s,</HI> with which he regarded the <HI>Danger</HI> of the
Con&s;piracy; while the Reflection, <HI>Who was the Author of it!</HI> gave him
&s;o moving a <HI>Mi&s;ery!</HI></P>
<P>UPON the Examination, and Confe&s;&s;ions, of that infinite Number
of Confederates, who were engag'd in the Prince's Projects, it ap|pear'd, that
the Defection was &s;o wide, and &s;o general, that many of his neare&s;t, and
mo&s;t tru&s;ted Servants, were embark'd in it; and &s;uch al&s;o, in who&s;e
Hands lay great Part of his Wealth and Power; &s;o that he was congra|tulated 
<PB N="193" REF="202"> in Form, by the Amba&s;&s;adors of Fo|reign Princes,
upon his Di&s;covery, and Pre|vention, of &s;o endangering a Combination. To

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a mo&s;t <HI>Catonick</HI> Adherer to the Old, <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> Simplicity; the Vertue, the Blunt|ne&s;s, and the Liberty,
which were the Or|naments of our Ance&s;tors.&mdash;I have taken &s;ome Pains
to prove, that <HI>we Britons,</HI> &s;hou'd not only be <HI>left Free</HI>;
but, that we <HI>ought</HI> to be left <HI>Rough,</HI> too.&mdash;I am not
able, there|fore, to re&s;i&s;t the Indignation, that ri&s;es in me, at the too
vi&s;ible Encrea&s;e, in the Num|ber of our <HI>Courtiers.</HI>&mdash;It is
natural for our Gentry, to love to &s;hine, in that gay Light: But, why
&s;hould <HI>Trade&s;men</HI> be corrupted by the Ta&s;te of undue
Dignity?&mdash;I cannot walk the Streets, but I &s;ee fre&s;h In&s;tances, in
every Corner, of the &s;preading Power of Preferment. The Court Verge, of old, 
<PB N="208" REF="217"> reach'd, I think, but to <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s.</HI>&mdash;Of late, it is <HI>ek'd</HI> out, to <HI>White-Chapel,</HI> and <HI>Norton-Folgate.</HI> Nay, I have been credi|bly
inform'd, that there are Courtiers of great Eminence, in and about <HI>Hockley
in the Hole</HI>!</P>
<P>I SHOU'D not be &s;o aver&s;e to this En|crea&s;e of the Royal
Retinue, if his Maje&s;ty's Ea&s;e, or Intere&s;t, were, proportionably,
en|larg'd by it.&mdash;Thus, it is neither U&s;ele&s;s, nor Uncomely, for a
Prince to have his <HI>Cow-Hou&s;e:</HI> But there is another Court
E&s;tabli&s;h|ment, which little can be &s;aid in &s;upport of, and that is,
the <HI>King's A&s;s-Hou&s;e.</HI>&mdash;His Honour, of this Office, holds his
Re|&s;idence, in the Road to <HI>Hide-Park-Corner:</HI> It being Decent, he
&s;ays, that his Dwelling &s;hou'd be near his Duty; and where he may be under
the Eye of his Fellow State&s;men.&mdash;I was the other Day at an odd
Chri&s;t'ning, in one of the Horns of this huge City, where, a newly preferr'd
Court Lady was complain|ing, to her Si&s;ter Go&s;&s;ips, How unavoid|able it
is, in Divided Times, for tho&s;e, who are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by Court Favours,
to have the <HI>Di&s;affected</HI> for their Enemies.&mdash;I whi|&s;per'd a
grave Gentlewoman, to know, what <HI>Po&s;t</HI> that great Lady held? And was
an|&s;wer'd, with becoming Seriou&s;ne&s;s, that &s;he was marry'd to the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Mu&s;tard-maker.</HI></P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty's <HI>Oculi&s;t, in Extraordinary,</HI> lately
departing this Life, I am glad, it has <PB N="209" REF="218"> been re&s;olv'd,
to aboli&s;h that High Station: Nothing being more dangerous to the Peace of a
Body Politic, than to multiply Officers, without Office.&mdash;Yet, there are
not wanting imprudent People, who have Hopes of in|&s;tituting a <HI>Royal
Mantua-maker,</HI> in Place of the defunct <HI>Oculi&s;t.</HI>&mdash;Now, it is
quite a dif|ferent Ca&s;e, where Commi&s;&s;ions are really u&s;eful: No good
Subject, for Example, can think much of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Pudding-maker,</HI> and a great deal might be &s;aid, in Honour of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Punch-hou&s;e.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Royal
Chimney-&s;weeper</HI> is a Mini&s;ter, not of Rank only, but Nece&s;&s;ity:
and &s;omething like it may be offer'd, in Behalf of <HI>His Maje&s;ty</HI>'s <HI>Butter-Woman.</HI>&mdash;But I wou'd be glad to be inform'd, what &s;erious
Pretence can be urg'd, by any Man, who makes a Con&s;cience of his Arguments,
in Defence of the <HI>Royal Gin|&s;hop?</HI>&mdash;Or, who can a&s;&s;ert the
Benefit, or, indeed, the Propriety, of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Royal
Riding-hood Woman?</HI> Or, <HI>His Maje&s;ty</HI>'s <HI>&s;worn
Staymaker?</HI></P>
<P>TO &s;peak with the good old Bluntne&s;s of a <HI>Briton,</HI>
the&s;e are &s;ome of the luxuriant <HI>Ex|cre&s;cences</HI> of Monarchy; and
wou'd, in the watchful Times of our Forefathers, have been par'd away, for the
Publick Benefit. And I will take it upon me to averr, that, unle&s;s &s;ome
&s;ea&s;onable Re&s;traint be &s;oon put upon this growing Evil, the Courtiers
will &s;et up Shops in the very Heart of the City; where, if, among their other
Cu&s;toms, they <PB N="210" REF="219"> &s;hou'd introduce their <HI>way of
Paying,</HI>&mdash;<HI>Trade</HI> will die of the Inoculation, and leave <HI>Credit</HI> its Executor.&mdash;I am,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a Woman, who, by the Help of a little Reading, am, &s;o far at
lea&s;t, more learned, than the Generality of my Sex, that a Hard Word does not
fright me. But my Husband is a Per&s;on, of great Goodne&s;s, and little
Knowledge. He has a &s;mall E&s;tate, in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and is only, what
they call a Sport&s;|man.&mdash;We came to Town, la&s;t Week; where my poor
Dear drank hard, and fell &s;o ill, that I was alarm'd for him.&mdash;The Lady,
who&s;e Hou&s;e we lodg'd at, wou'd needs &s;end for <HI>Doctor
Fo&s;&s;ile,</HI> who is, I find upon Enquiry, a Man of excellent Learning;
but, to borrow a Phra&s;e of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>'s, it is <HI>&s;icklied
over,</HI> with Affectation.&mdash;When he had felt my Husband's Pul&s;e, and
gone through his Cour&s;e of Que&s;tions, he turn'd, from whi&s;pering Mr. <HI>Juniper,</HI> who was in wait|ing, at his Elbow; and &s;aid to me, with a
phy&s;ical Air, not the Air of a Phy&s;ician,&mdash;<HI>Maam</HI>!&mdash;I have
order'd <HI>Mr. What's his Name</HI> here, your Spou&s;e's Apothecary, to <HI>Phlebotomize</HI> him, to Morrow Morning.&mdash;<HI>To do what to me?</HI>
cry'd my poor Husband, <PB N="211" REF="220"> &s;tarting up, in his
Bed&mdash;<HI>I will never con|&s;ent to &s;uffer it&mdash;No,&mdash;I am not,
I thank God, in &s;o de&s;perate a Condition, as to under|go &s;uch a damnable
Operation as that is.</HI>&mdash;As <HI>what is?</HI> my Dear,&mdash;an&s;wer'd
I, half &s;mile|ing,&mdash;The Doctor wou'd only have you <HI>blooded.</HI>&mdash;Ay,&mdash;for <HI>bleeding,</HI> reply'd he, <HI>I like
it well enough.&mdash;But, for that other Thing he order'd, I will &s;ooner
die, than &s;ubmit to it.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, Good Sir!&mdash;cannot &s;uch a u&s;eful Ma&s;s of Learning, as
di&s;tingui&s;hes <HI>Doctor Fo&s;&s;ile,</HI> render him capable of
di&s;cerning, and correcting, this odd Weakne&s;s?&mdash;It expo&s;es him to
the Ridicule of malicious Per&s;ons, who, hating a Merit, they de&s;pair of
ever equalling, are glad to depreciate his Character, by make|ing the Wor&s;t
of his Particularity.&mdash;Since <HI>Ars e&s;t celare Artem,</HI> the Doctor
wou'd be thought more learn'd, if he le&s;s endeavour'd to di&s;play his
Learning. I know, I have made a forc'd Application of my little <HI>Latin</HI>
Sentence; yet, it will do, well enough, too, in the Sen&s;e that I have given
it.&mdash;I am,</P>

<P>THE Writer of the <HI>Rehear&s;al,</HI> puts in|to the Mouth of Mr. <HI>Bayes,</HI> with regard to the <HI>Good</HI> to be <HI>extracted</HI> from <HI>Books,</HI> by the mo&s;t <HI>indifferent</HI> Hands, a Truth, that might
have been &s;poken by a Per&s;on, who&s;e Air of Gravity, was not (like that of
Mr. <HI>Bayes,</HI>) in|tended to make him Ridiculous.</P>
<P>HOW far was I from thinking Mr. <HI>Jyngle</HI> the mo&s;t Eligible
Companion in the World, when I met him at Sir <HI>Portly</HI>'s? And yet this
very Mr. <HI>Jyngle,</HI> (for I will take heed how I an|ger &s;o touchy a
Philologi&s;t, by mi&s;-&s;pelling his Name any more, with a broad-back'd <HI>Gothick</HI> G, as he calls it) no &s;ooner became my Cor|re&s;pondent, but
he proved him&s;elf a Man of more than ordinary Parts, and one who&s;e Ta|lents
are new and uncommon. I may liken him to &s;ome curious Engine, of great U&s;e
to me in my Writing-Capacity; and very nece&s;|&s;ary <PB N="213" REF="222"> in
the Machinery of &s;ome Inventions which I &s;hall make known in the Cour&s;e
of the&s;e PAPERS, for the Benefit of tho&s;e, who have contracted an ill Habit
of Humour, and are &s;ickly in their Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I EXPRESS my&s;elf, with much Seriou&s;|ne&s;s, when I declare, as I
here do, that I know not one Science, &s;o Advantageous in <HI>Theory,</HI> as
Mr. <HI>Jyngle</HI>'s New Sy&s;tem of <HI>Mind Midwife|ry.</HI> If this lucky
Gentleman can but make it an&s;wer in <HI>Practice,</HI> according to the
va&s;t Idea's I conceive of its Excellence and U&s;e, he will be as much
&s;uperior to <HI>Hippocrates</HI> as the Soul is to the Body. Now, <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> as Sir <HI>Clouterly Rumble,</HI> in one of his <HI>Phy&s;ical</HI> Treati&s;es, informs us, was complimented with <HI>Divine</HI> Honours, ju&s;t as his Predece&s;&s;or <HI>Ae&s;|culapius</HI>
had been erected to the Dignity of a <HI>Demi-God,</HI> from &s;o <HI>low</HI>
a &s;etting out, as that of a <HI>Tooth-drawer.</HI> As mean a Conception,
therefore, as I, or any of my <HI>Readers,</HI> might have, too ha&s;tily,
entertained of Mr. <HI>Jyngle,</HI> as a mere Repeater of his own Rhimes, there
is now ample Room for forming great Idea's of his Abilities, and of the
Preferment, he may come to, &s;ince he is, the Inventor, and will, in all
Probability, be the Perfecter of this <HI>more noble Art of Healing.</HI> And
if, in the very Infancy of his Science, he makes a thorough Cure of his
de&s;perate Patient Sir <HI>Clouterly</HI>; I do verily think, after that,
there will not be the lea&s;t Room for any <HI>&s;ick minded</HI> Per&s;on
what|&s;oever, to de&s;pair of Succe&s;s under his <HI>Regimen.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="223">HOWEVER, &s;ince a Per&s;on mu&s;t be in a <HI>painful</HI> way indeed, before he <HI>cries out</HI> for the Phy&s;ician,
I would propound a kind of <HI>Diet</HI> to tho&s;e who di&s;cover Symptoms of
any ap|proaching Spiritual Malady, which will &s;erve them by way of
Prevention. This Method is certainly preferable to the common way of Delaying
till the Di&s;ea&s;e is actually upon them, which is then in Danger of not
being removed, without Recour&s;e to violent Reme|dies. In Sir <HI>Clouterly</HI>'s Ca&s;e, the Pre&s;cription of Mr. <HI>Jyngle</HI> is &s;o
very ungentle, that Fair Ladies, who find them&s;elves a going into any <HI>Immoral Habit,</HI> &s;hould, one would think, take early Care to &s;top
the Progre&s;s of it, for fear of lying under the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch
dreadful Emeticks. That, it &s;eems, which the <HI>Titled</HI> Patient mu&s;t
be forced to undergo, for the Cure of <HI>Vanity</HI> only, (and, what
Per&s;on, with a <HI>Title,</HI> thinks <HI>Vanity</HI> &s;o <HI>great</HI> an <HI>Ill?</HI>) will, he confe&s;&s;es, be attended with &s;uch violent
Workings, that it will make him <HI>vomit his Heart up.</HI> Now, who would not
avoid this rough Handling, by taking Things in Time, when they apprehend a
Di&s;order to be ri&s;ing, and ob&s;erving a regular <HI>Mind-Diet.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL proceed, to lay down &s;ome ge|neral Rules, and &s;hort
Recipes, by way of Spe|cimen, that the Ladies, e&s;pecially, may encou|rage a
Pocket Volume, which I intend &s;hort|ly to publi&s;h, on the Subject of <HI>Mind-Labours,</HI> and <HI>Deliveries,</HI> and which I only wi&s;h may be
di&s;per&s;ed into as many Hands as <HI>Culpeper</HI>'s Mid|wifery; 
<PB N="215" REF="224"> for I am &s;ure I may &s;ay, without Boa&s;ting, it will
be a more u&s;eful and valua|ble Treati&s;e.</P>
<P>PERSONS, who have any Con&s;ideration for the Health of their Minds,
are de&s;ired to re|flect <HI>Seriou&s;ly,</HI> that all <HI>Exce&s;&s;ive
Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> are <HI>Di&s;tempers</HI> of the <HI>Mind</HI>; and but <HI>Fore-runners</HI> of <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> in the <HI>Body.</HI> Let them
know, that nothing conduces more, to the Re&s;traint of the&s;e <HI>Humours,</HI> (which grow peccant and per+nicious, the very Moment they
become Inor|dinate,) than Exerci&s;e in the Thinking Fa|culty.</P>
<P>READING the Salutary Maxims of Wi&s;e Men, with Attention, dige&s;ting
them by Me|ditation, and imprinting them on the Memory, by frequent
Recollection, is a <HI>Mind-Diet</HI> or <HI>Regimen,</HI> which will, in a
&s;hort Time, re&s;tore Health to a decayed Con&s;titution, and add incredible
Vigour, to a Weak and Langui&s;hing Under&s;tanding. Minds the be&s;t arm'd,
are not always Invulnerable: There are con&s;tantly &s;ome peevi&s;h Accidents,
&s;ome cro&s;s and fret|ful Di&s;appointments, in the rugged Road of Life, to
throw a Cloud over the &s;erene&s;t, and di&s;compo&s;e the mo&s;t equal
Tempers. But, there is not methinks, a quicker or &s;weeter Re|medy than to
&s;tep to the Clo&s;et, and take down a <HI>moral Draught,</HI> which will
&s;mooth us into the mo&s;t perfect Calm. <HI>Gallus, Tibullus, Ovid,
Catullus,</HI> will afford us <HI>Lenitives</HI>; and <HI>Horace, Juvenal</HI>
and <HI>Per&s;ius,</HI> will furni&s;h us with <HI>Cor|ro&s;ives,</HI> &s;o
that we may find a Cure for every <PB N="216" REF="225"> Di&s;temper. There are
not any Infirmities, Pains, or Sufferings of the Mind, but what the Writings of
&s;ome of the&s;e Doctors contain proper <HI>Specificks</HI> for. The be&s;t of
this Method of pre&s;cribing, is, that the Phy&s;ick is ea&s;y and delightful.
For what does it con&s;i&s;t in but Exerci&s;ing one's Wits with &s;ome of the
be&s;t Company in the World, whom even Ladies cannot go to for Diver&s;ion,
without finding them at the &s;ame Time u&s;eful, or vi&s;it for
In&s;truc|tion, without finding them agreeable. <HI>Dry|den, Congreve,</HI>
&amp;c. Have made them refined <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and our <HI>Modern</HI>
Beauties have the &s;ame Advantages in their <HI>Tran&s;lations,</HI> the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Ladies had in the <HI>Originals.</HI></P>
<P>WHY &s;hould it not be the Care of profe&s;s'd <HI>Vi&s;iters,</HI>
not to contract ill Habits which are always very catching, and fill the Mind,
with Spots and Blemi&s;hes? a Toa&s;t that never had the Small-Pox, would be in
a Pannick, at the Appearance of a Face newly mark'd; and Per|&s;ons who break
out with Detraction, have the Small-Pox of the Mind, and are frightful when the
Marks are upon them.</P>
<P>YOU &s;hall &s;ee a Young Creature torture her|&s;elf into Beauty
puni&s;h her&s;elf to plea&s;e her Lover, and skin her Face for a Complexion;
And yet, tho' &s;he knows &s;he is a little Vixen in her Nature, &s;he &s;hall
not &s;o much as once, after &s;he is married to him, endeavour to learn, how
&s;he may avoid the praeternatural <HI>Palene&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Flu&s;hings,</HI> which Anger excites in a Beautiful Countenance, giving
the whole Form of it &s;uch <PB N="217" REF="226"> a contrary Ca&s;t, that it
is enough to terrify all Beholders. Whenever any of the&s;e blooming Bu&s;tlers
begin to blu&s;ter, the Husband may be the Phy&s;ician; for, when the fiery
Par|ticles within them betray any of the <HI>Soft</HI> Things to an unbecoming
Fit of <HI>Rage,</HI> the Sight of a Looking-Gla&s;s, at that Critical Minute
of De|formity, has been pre&s;cribed by our Fore|fathers with admirable, and
neverfailing Effect. But this is only a tran&s;itory Cure, and does not go to
the Root of the Di&s;ea&s;e. There are Pa&s;|&s;ages relating to the Effects of <HI>Anger</HI> in a mar|ried State, that would place their <HI>In&s;ide</HI> as
clear|ly before them. A Lady, whom this Practice would not work into
Gentlene&s;s of Temper, could never be cured of &s;o violent an Inflam|mation,
but by one of Mr. <HI>Jyngle</HI>'s &s;evere&s;t Operations.</P>
<P>IS a Lady jealous? And will &s;he not have Sen&s;e enough, to blu&s;h
at the Follies of Jealou&s;y, when &s;he is reading them, in private, and
&s;ave her&s;elf from the Inconveniency of looking frightful, in publick
Company? She &s;tands highly in need of Mr. <HI>Jyngle.</HI> Who, that could
not <HI>read</HI> away a <HI>Fit</HI> of the <HI>Spleen,</HI> in that Excellent <HI>Modern</HI> Poem, the <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> could be otherwi&s;e than
given over, as quite lo&s;t, Unle&s;s Mr. <HI>Jyngle</HI> appear'd, to carry it
off, by his new Invention? Tho&s;e Ladies, who have <HI>Wit</HI> enough to
plead their being of the <HI>Unfortify'd</HI> Sex in &s;o <HI>artful</HI> a
Manner, 
<Q><PB N="218" REF="227"> 
<L>That, if weak Women go a&s;tray,</L> 
<L>Their Stars are more in Fault, than they,</L> </Q> have likewi&s;e <HI>Wit</HI> enough, to <HI>Fortify</HI> them|&s;elves by proper Lectures,
again&s;t the Attacks of Pa&s;&s;ion and Folly. Therefore, after this
&s;ea&s;onable Warning, Mr. <HI>Jyngle is the Word</HI>; and if any wild,

<P>THE Lo&s;s of Friends is a Mi&s;ery, which, more than any other, puts
our Patience to the Trial; and breaks in upon Human Na|ture with a Violence not
to be re&s;i&s;ted. All the Looks, Words, and Actions, of tho&s;e, who were
dear to us, in their Life-times, ri&s;e, like Gho&s;ts, to haunt the Memory:
But, with this Difference from their Effects, before Death had interpos'd, that

have Recour&s;e to, for &s;ome Mitigation of our Sorrow: Whereas their <HI>Vertues,</HI> their <HI>Endearments,</HI> and the <HI>Good Offices</HI>

&s;he drowns her <HI>Charms</HI> in <HI>Tears,</HI> that rai&s;es <HI>Beauty</HI> into <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>; and mixes Reve|rence with our

<P>THE Force of Natural Affection has its &s;tronge&s;t Effect, in <HI>Mothers</HI> from the great Ne|ce&s;&s;ity there is, for that long Care,

<P>THIS Thought, of her Son's Sorrow, and his becoming &s;o alter'd by

a Mixture in it, of the <HI>Tender</HI> and the <HI>Wild</HI>! Something &s;o
exqui&s;itely adapt|ed both to her Character, and her Condition, that I have

<LETTER>
<PB N="222" REF="231">
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the Plea&s;ure of a very intimate Acquaintance with that
unhappy young Gentleman, who&s;e Ver&s;es to a Painter, you printed in one of
your PLAIN DEALERS; with a generous Remark, or two, on the Merit of the poor
Gentleman, him&s;elf, and the uncommon Cruelty of his <HI>Mother.</HI></P>
<P>PERHAPS few Things cou'd be more &s;ur|prizing, than a Hi&s;tory of
his Birth and U&s;age!&mdash;Of two Fathers, whom he might have claim'd, and <HI>both</HI> of them <HI>Noble,</HI> he lo&s;t the <HI>Title,</HI> of the one,
and a <HI>Provi&s;ion</HI> from the other's Pity, by the Means alone of this <HI>Mother!</HI> who, as if &s;he had re&s;olv'd, not to leave him a &s;ingle
Comfort, afterwards robb'd him of <HI>her&s;elf</HI> too! and, in direct
Op|po&s;ition to the Impul&s;e of her Natural Com|pa&s;&s;ion, upon mi&s;taken
Motives of a fal&s;e Delicacy, &s;hut her Memory again&s;t his Wants, and
ca&s;t him out to the &s;evere&s;t Mi|&s;eries; without allowing her&s;elf to
contri|bute even &s;uch &s;mall Aid, as might at lea&s;t, have pre&s;erv'd him
from Angui&s;h; and pointed out &s;ome Path to his future In|du&s;try.</P>
<P>BUT I forbear to be too particular, on any of the&s;e Heads,
becau&s;e I know it wou'd give him Pain, for who&s;e &s;ake only I remember
them: For while Nature acts &s;o weakly, on the Humanity of the Parent, &s;he
&s;eems, on the Son's &s;ide, to have doubled her <PB N="223" REF="232">
u&s;ual Influence. Even the mo&s;t &s;hocking Per&s;onal Repul&s;es, and a
Series of Contempt and Injuries, received, at her Hands, through the whole
Cour&s;e of his Life, have not been able to eraze, from his Heart, the
Impre&s;|&s;ions of his filial Duty: Nor, which is much more &s;trange! of his
Affection. I have known him walk, three or four times, in a dark Evening,
through the Street this <HI>Mo|ther</HI> lives in, only for the Melancholy
Plea|&s;ure of looking up, at her Windows, in Hopes to catch a Moment's Sight
of her, as &s;he might cro&s;s the Room by Candle Light.</P>
<P>HIS good Qualities, which are very nu|merous, ought the more to be
e&s;teem'd and cheri&s;h'd becau&s;e he owes them to him&s;elf only: And,
without the Advantage of Friends, Fortune, or Education, wants nei|ther
Knowledge nor Politene&s;s, to de&s;erve a <HI>Mother</HI>'s Ble&s;&s;ing, and
adorn, rather than di&s;grace her.&mdash;I am &s;trongly per&s;uaded, from the
Character, which, upon all Occa|&s;ions, he has taken Plea&s;ure to give me of
the Lady's Humanity, with regard to the re&s;t of the World, that nothing but
her hav|ing, much too long, already been a Stranger to &s;uch a Son, cou'd make
her &s;atisfy'd to continue &s;o.&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t, that
&s;he &s;hou'd not di&s;tingui&s;h him, by &s;ome kind Notice; &s;ome little
Mark of her returning Tenderne&s;s; if, without Regard to his Me|rit, &s;he
knew but his Manner of thinking of her: Which is, it&s;elf, a &s;hining Merit!
and <PB N="224" REF="233"> a &s;urprizing In&s;tance of Genero&s;ity! if
con|&s;ider'd again&s;t tho&s;e Rea&s;ons, which might excu&s;e a different
Treatment of her.</P>
<P>He writ the following Copy of Ver&s;es, and &s;everal other, on the
&s;ame Subject, at a Time, when I know not which was mo&s;t to be wonder'd
at;&mdash;That he &s;hou'd be &s;erene enough, for <HI>Poetry,</HI> under, the
Extremity of Ill-Fortune!&mdash;Or, that his <HI>Subject</HI> &s;hou'd be the
Prai&s;e of her, to whom he ow'd a Life of Mi&s;ery!</P>

<L>Cro&s;s his cold Bed, in wild Di&s;order, thrown,</L>

<P>THEY, who are depriv'd, by Death, of their deare&s;t Friends, and
Relations, are left wretched, in the Want of them; But they have this Comfort,
however,&mdash;that, before tho&s;e Deaths, they were happier:&mdash;Whereas
this Gentleman, on the contrary, is unhappy, by his Mother's Lo&s;s, while
&s;he is <HI>living,</HI> gay, and fortunate! and only <HI>dead,</HI> to that
Affecti|on, which other Mothers chiefly <HI>live for!</HI></P>
<P>IF you, Mr. <HI>Plain-Dealer,</HI> wou'd give us a Paper, on the&s;e
Heads, it might, I believe, have &s;ome Effect, for the Service of a too early
Sufferer, who&s;e Merit, and the Wrongs he has &s;u&s;tain'd, from his Parent's
Cruelty, entitle him to the Hope, of finding better Parents, among Strangers!
to the open Re|proach, and Di&s;honour of a <HI>Mother,</HI> who, &s;ince &s;he
has &s;o many fine Qualites, wants, perhaps, but to be touch'd into a Sen&s;e

<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your mo&s;t Humble Servant, <HI>AMINTAS.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I AM &s;orry, that, in a Nation, ju&s;tly famous for Good-Nature, we
have &s;o &s;trong an <HI>Ex|ception,</HI> as may be taken from this Letter.
But I will forbear, with my Corre&s;pondent's Leave, to addre&s;s any
Arguments, to the <HI>Lady:</HI> Since, if &s;he is not harden'd, beyond
Nature, the ge|nerous Sorrow, and the Sufferings, expre&s;s'd, in her Son's
Sentiments, will melt her Heart into Pity for him; and move her, more
effec|tually, than any Thing, that can be, morally, offer'd to her.</P>
<P>I WILL turn my Advice, therefore, to the Service of tho&s;e Sons and
Daughters, who are neglected, and made unhappy, by the Aver|&s;ion, or
Partiality, of the Parent they depend on. A Ca&s;e, too common, in mo&s;t
Families! and which &s;tands in need of all the Comfort, that can be pour'd
upon their Affliction.</P>
<P>IT is a very melancholy Circum&s;tance when this happens, as it often
does, to the fine&s;t &s;pirited Child, of the whole Number. But it &s;hou'd be
Ground enough for Con&s;olation, that &s;uch Sufferers owe the wrong
Po&s;ition, they appear in, to a Weakne&s;s in the Parents Rea&s;on: A kind of
Deception, in their Judg|ment's <HI>Sight!</HI> As, when we &s;ee our Shadows, 
<PB N="227" REF="236"> in the Water, our Heads &s;eem to hang down|wards; and
our lowe&s;t Parts are preferr'd, to look, unnaturally, uppermo&s;t.</P>
<P>TIME will, certainly, bring a Remedy, to tho&s;e, who bear this Trial,
with Temperance: For Submi&s;&s;ion di&s;arms the Rancour, that wou'd gather
Strength, from Exerci&s;e, by an imprudent Oppo&s;ition. None, who&s;e Injuries
are receiv'd, with Mildne&s;s, and return'd by Acts of Affection, can be, long,
without di&s;|covering, and repenting, their Ingratitude. Whereas, by
permitting our&s;elves to <HI>revenge</HI> the Wrongs we &s;uffer, we furni&s;h
our Oppre&s;|&s;ors with an Appearance of Ju&s;tice; and only make them more
blind, when 'tis our Intere&s;t, that they &s;hou'd &s;ee clearly.</P>
<P>IMPATIENCE under this, or any other, Affliction, does but double our
Mortification. How languid wou'd Life be, to the large&s;t Part of the World,
if Expectation did not quicken it! <HI>Hope</HI> is the &s;weete&s;t, of all
Companions!&mdash;If it leads us not to the Road, which we are mo&s;t inclin'd
to travel in, its Conver&s;ation, however, is &s;o entertaining, and agreeable,
that we can never tire, in the Journey.</P>
<P>WHEN a wicked Man is happy, he &s;eems unworthy of his Happine&s;s:
But, where Ver|tue is unfortunate, it looks the larger, for the Clouds we &s;ee
it through.&mdash;There is a Courage, in Adver&s;ity, that can put Fortune out
of Countenance.&mdash;Men are not de&s;picable, by their Fate, but, by their
Manner of &s;upport|ing it. The Lyon has more Maje&s;ty, in his 
<PB N="228" REF="237"> Chains, than when in the Fore&s;t: His Fierce|ne&s;s is
reduc'd, and &s;often'd, by the Re&s;traint of his Condition, and, what was <HI>terrible,</HI> in him, before, becomes <HI>venerable,</HI> by his
Calamity.</P>
<P>BUT, we &s;hou'd not only bear our Misfor|tunes, with <HI>Patience</HI>; we &s;hou'd &s;u&s;tain 'em, too, with <HI>Silence.</HI>&mdash;Complaints are <HI>weak</HI> Mens Weapons: And, there
was &s;omething, delicate, and finely judg'd, in the Conduct of a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Merchant, I have read of, who, finding him|&s;elf on the
Brink of Ruin, by a Race of Lo&s;&s;es, that befel him, gave &s;trict Orders,
to his Son, that he &s;hou'd &s;peak of it to Nobody. For, otherwi&s;e, &s;aid
he, of <HI>One</HI> Misfortune, we &s;hall make <HI>Two&mdash;The Lo&s;s,
it&s;elf, which we com|plain of;&mdash;and our Enemy's rejoicing at
it.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, as the mo&s;t perfect Plea&s;ures in the World are always mix'd
with Afflictions, &s;o the &s;harpe&s;t Afflictions have their U&s;es, and
their Plea&s;ures.&mdash;A Man's be&s;t Friend, is his <HI>Enemy!</HI> Since by
mortifying his Vanity, he adorns his Nature with Humility; and teaches him to
&s;hun the Practice of tho&s;e Ill Qualities, toward Others, which he finds
&s;o unju&s;t, and hateful, while he him&s;elf is oppre&s;s'd by them.</P>
<P>BUT, while I talk of Humility, I blu&s;h, at my own Pride, who wou'd
teach others a Sci|ence, which I am my&s;elf, but a Learner in.&mdash;My
Reader, in this Ca&s;e, mu&s;t be &s;o good as to compare me to a Blind Man,
with a Torch in his Hand&mdash;Though I &s;ee not my own Way, I carry Light
enough along with me, to guide the Steps of tho&s;e who follow me.</P>

<P>GOING la&s;t <HI>Sunday,</HI> in the Afternoon, to a Church, not far

&s;uppre&s;s'd during the Reign of your great Predece&s;&s;or, Venerable <HI>Spec,</HI> of Immortal Memory, are crept again, into

re&s;train a giddy Covey, of young Female Gold-finches from fluttering their
Fans into a Whirlwind; that blew Grace, and Edification, quite out of the

be|cau&s;e, if this <HI>Work</HI> is any way an&s;werable to its <HI>Title,</HI> the Author will de&s;erve to be con|&s;ider'd as a Patriot! and

<SALUTE>Worthy SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MY own &s;elf am a <HI>Barber,</HI> by Trade, but my Wife takes in <HI>Plain-work.</HI> I cou'd never endure to be Idle; and, therefore, when we
rented a little Hou&s;e, in the New-Buildings, I hung a Board, at my Pole's
End, with the&s;e Words writ upon it, in Great Letters, <HI>SHAVE FOR A
PENNY,</HI> Though I &s;ay it, that &s;hou'd not, I have a clean Stroke with a
Razor: But, becau&s;e I love a &s;tirring Trade, I thought it better to work
for a little, than &s;tand &s;till, and get no|thing. Now, it is a &s;trange
Thing to con&s;ider, how little Encouragement <HI>Hone&s;t Indu&s;try</HI>
meets with.</P>
<P>ONE Evening, la&s;t Week, a Beau with a great Black-Bag at his Back,
was &s;et down, out of a Stage-Coach; and fixing his Eye upon my Pole, put his
Hand to his Beard, and came directly to my Door, as if he meant, I &s;hou'd
Shave him: But, as &s;oon as he read my <HI>Rate,</HI> that was written on my <HI>Show Board,</HI> he turn'd &s;hort, upon his Heel; and cry'd out with a
&s;illy Oath, 
<Q REND="inline">"That, <HI>Six Pence,</HI> he thought, was too
little, for a clean Shav|ing: But, if a Man mu&s;t pay for being <HI>flea'd,</HI> a <HI>Penny</HI> was too much in Con&s;cience.</Q> </P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="247"> I WAS quite out of Heart, at this unex|pected
Return, for falling the Price of my Practice: And my poor Wife, who over|heard
it, as &s;he &s;at at work, fell a crying, at the Ill-Nature of it. But,
pre&s;ently, we heard a jolly Voice, in the Street, <HI>Come, let us go
in:&mdash;I will encourage this Hone&s;t Fellow, though I have been &s;hav'd
once, to Day, already.</HI> So, there came into my Shop a grave, well-dre&s;s'd
Gentleman, and a pretty Youth with him: He was kind, and talk'd very familiar
to me; and had &s;o good-humour'd a Face, that I lov'd dearly to look upon him:
When I had done with him, he &s;aid, that I had the &s;oft Sweep of your <HI>Turki&s;h Barbers</HI>; and, as he was going out of my Shop he gave me a

<P>AS &s;oon as he was gone, my Wife fell a crying, again.&mdash;But,
this Time it was for <HI>Joy,</HI> That in &s;pite of <HI>Beaux</HI> and <HI>Black-Bags,</HI> there is &s;ome good <HI>Nature</HI> left in the World
yet.&mdash;If you will put this into your PLAIN DEALER, and <HI>accept of a

<P>IT is &s;aid, by a Vulgar Error, That <HI>the Eng|li&s;h are fond of
Novelty.</HI>&mdash;I have won|der'd, a Thou&s;and Times, how this Notion
became e&s;tabli&s;h'd: For, that nothing is more fal&s;e, in Fact, may be
proved, from our olde&s;t Hi&s;tories: and is, every Day, remarkable, in our
modern, and familiar Practice.</P>
<P>THOUGH <HI>ten Engli&s;hmen,</HI> in <HI>twelve,</HI> are the
De&s;cendants of <HI>Foreigners,</HI> and the very Name it&s;elf, of <HI>England,</HI> is <HI>Foreign:</HI> Yet, the Noti|on of a <HI>Foreigner</HI>
has been, always, ridicu|lou&s;ly, di&s;ta&s;tful to us!</P>
<P>INNOVATIONS were ever odious to us; and we cho&s;e rather to <HI>neglect</HI> Advantages, than to try an untrodden Path, for 'em.&mdash;What
lo&s;t <HI>England</HI> the fir&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Gold and Silver
World in the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies,</HI> but her Di&s;po&s;ition to
di&s;credit <HI>Novelty?</HI>&mdash;Our very <HI>Laws</HI> depend on <HI>Precedent:</HI>&mdash;And the De|fence, even of Rights, in Parliament, is
&s;up|ported upon what <HI>has been</HI>; and &s;eems uncon|cern'd 
<PB N="240" REF="249"> in <HI>why it was.</HI> Tho&s;e &s;candalous
Op|po&s;itions, which are &s;o ob&s;tinately given, to the Cleare&s;t Bills,
for Publick Benefit, &s;uch, as <HI>making our Rivers Navigable,&mdash;Putting
our Lands under a Regi&s;ter,&mdash;Promoting untry'd Trades,</HI>&mdash;And <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hing National Fi&s;heries:</HI> Are, all, convincing
In&s;tances, that no Nation, under Heaven, have &s;o fix'd an Aver&s;ion to <HI>Novelty</HI>; which, yet, every Body is imputing to us, as the Reigning
Humour of our Coun|try.</P>
<P>BUT we have a Pre&s;ent Example, that will confirm my Remark, and for
ever put to Si|lence tho&s;e, who accu&s;e us of the Love of Novelty. I mean,
the new Practice, of <HI>Ino|culating the Small-Pox,</HI> on Bodies,
purpo&s;ely, prepar'd to receive it: So, to prevent the u&s;ual Danger, and
Malignancy, of that Di&s;temper; and &s;u&s;tain it, without the Terror, the
Fatali|ty, and the Sorrow, which have heretofore, gone along with it.</P>
<P>IT was a generous Undertaking, in that Pub|lick-&s;pirited Member of
the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> who, re&s;olving, by <HI>clear Matter of Fact,</HI>
to e&s;tabli&s;h or explode, this Practice, has, with an unwea|ried
Application, and the mo&s;t &s;tedfa&s;t Impar|tiality, inform'd him&s;elf of
its Succe&s;s, through|out all Parts of the Kingdom; and given the World an
Account of it, in his Pamphlet, late|ly publi&s;h'd. A Treati&s;e! which
de&s;erves the Eye, and mo&s;t careful Con&s;ideration, of every Parent, who
has <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> or who wou'd &s;ave a Favourite Child, the promis'd
Comfort of <PB N="241" REF="250"> his Life! from being &s;natch'd away, perhaps
in its Bloom, by the Sweep of this Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>IT is demon&s;trated, in the mention'd Trea|ti&s;e, from a Forty
Year's Examination of the Bills of Mortality, 
<Q REND="inline">'That the Small-Pox car|ries off, at lea&s;t, <HI>one</HI> in every <HI>&s;ix,</HI> of all whom it &s;eizes in the <HI>natural</HI> Way; whereas not one in <HI>fifty,</HI> (&s;carce one in many <HI>hundreds</HI>) of tho&s;e who receive it by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> have been
found to die under it.</Q></P>
<P>THE whole Number of Per&s;ons, who have been &s;o much as
&s;u&s;pected to owe their Deaths to it, ever &s;ince its fir&s;t Introduction,
in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> amounts to <HI>Nine,</HI> only!&mdash;They are, all
nam'd, in the Printed Account; and there is &s;carce one among them, for
who&s;e Death a Clearer Cau&s;e, than the Inoculation, is not a&s;&s;ign'd, and
atte&s;ted, by the very Phy&s;icians, and Surgeons, who directed the
Operation&mdash;So that Providence &s;eems to have guided, and enlighten'd, <HI>Art,</HI> in this Practice, to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and relieve, <HI>Nature,</HI>
for the Pre&s;ervation of the Human Species.</P>
<P>YET, with what Violence, and Malice, has it not been rail'd at, and
oppos'd?&mdash;How many Fal&s;e Affirmations have we &s;een, with unblu&s;hing
Boldne&s;s, in&s;ulting Truth, in our Publick News-Papers!&mdash;Nay, the
Pulpits, too, have trembled, under the Zeal of <HI>Reverend Railers</HI>; who,
in the holy Blindne&s;s of their Pa&s;&s;ion, have &s;hewn us <HI>Job,</HI>
upon his Dung|hill; <HI>inoculated,</HI> for the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> by the <HI>De|vil,</HI> of a Surgeon!</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="251">IT has been repre&s;ented, as a <HI>Wilful
Mur|der!</HI> A new, and wicked, Pre&s;umption! An A&s;&s;ault on the
Prerogative of Heaven! And a taking <HI>God's own</HI> Work out of his Hands,
to be mended by <HI>Man's</HI> Arrogance!</P>
<P>BUT the Common Arguments, however de&s;|picable, give me Diver&s;ion,
and Entertainment.&mdash;When I hear a pious Old Woman wi&s;ely
wondering,&mdash;<HI>What this World would come to!</HI> and concluding her
Remarks with this great Maxim of Re&s;ignation, that <HI>God's own Time is

Another.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IT is an e&s;tabli&s;h'd Rule, among&s;t Game|&s;ters, That <HI>Lo&s;ers &s;hou'd have leave to &s;peak:</HI> And, for this Rea&s;on, I

<Q REND="inline">"That the only Thing in the World, worth knowing, and

<P>I AM a young Widow-Woman, that was bred and born in <HI>Wapping</HI>; and, had one of the Be&s;t of Husbands; that was Ma&s;ter of
as good a Ship as ever us'd the <HI>Guiney-Trade.</HI> But he dy'd, in his
la&s;t Voyage, as he was bringing Home a great <HI>Elephant</HI> for a <HI>Token:</HI> And I have taken a &s;trange Fancy to the Bea&s;t, becau&s;e he

<P>BUT, for all he looks &s;o big, there is no Manner of Harm in him.
He is as Tame, as one of us, Women; and plays twenty clever Tricks, to make
People merry, that make much of him.&mdash;One cou'dn't forbear laughing, tho'
one lay a dying, to &s;ee, how the good-natur'd, clum&s;y, Bea&s;t will dance <HI>Moll Peatly!</HI> He will &s;o catch up his Feet, <PB N="250" REF="259">
and frisk round, in a &s;mall Compa&s;s; and thump the Floor, to keep Time; and
move his Back-&s;ide to the Mu&s;ick! and, in &s;hort, your other End o' the
Town Dancing-Ma&s;ters, are <HI>no Body at all,</HI> to him!</P>
<P>HE plays at <HI>Trap-Ball,</HI> in a Rope-Walk, by our Hou&s;e; and

look'd a little &s;illy, at fir&s;t, and tumbled off, when they cry'd, <HI>Jump, for the King</HI>; and cou'dn't keep &s;teady, for the Life of
him.&mdash;He cracks Nuts, with his No&s;e: and makes a woeful Splutter, when
he gets Loo&s;e among the Herb-Womens Apple-Baskets.&mdash;All my Neighbours
love him; and tell me, that he will bring in a world of Money, if I would but <HI>make a Show of him.</HI>&mdash;Pray, what is your Opinion? And

<SALUTE>Honourable SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OBSERVING by &s;ome of your <HI>Plain-Dealers,</HI> that you are a
great Admirer of the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> I humbly pre&s;ume to
acquaint you, that I am, lately, come out of his Country; and have brought with
me a Commodity, call'd a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian Bear.</HI>&mdash;He has &s;har'd very
largely, in the Improvements of his Fellow Subjects; for, he can fiddle, as
well as any Body; he &s;its bolt up on End, and holds his <HI>Kit</HI> in one
Paw, with the Butt End again&s;t his Belly; and, with his Fiddle|&s;tick in the
other Paw, <HI>tunes it away,</HI> after the <HI>Italian</HI> Manner, with his
Head o' one &s;ide, all in Raptures, at his own Harmony!&mdash;It wou'd do your

For he &s;hakes his No&s;e, and his Paw, together, with &s;uch a Variety of

<P>BUT, there is one Thing, that I take to be a very particular
Happine&s;s to him! He looks, when he is Grave, for all the World, like that
Ingenious <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Gentleman, that has &s;o many diverting Fancies, to
get Money, by making Ladies, and Gentlemen, merry together. If they were to be
dre&s;s'd both alike, I am confident there wou'd be no knowing 'em a&s;under.
May be, that may go a great Way, toward making the poor Thing's
Fortune.&mdash;I have him, here in <PB N="252" REF="261"> Town, but he is out

<P>I TACK this extraordinary Pair of <HI>Epi&s;tles</HI> together,
becau&s;e of a manife&s;t Re&s;emblance in their Contents; and, for that I am

a fairer Promi&s;e, for their own Benefit.</P>
<P>SOME <HI>State&s;men,</HI> who look <HI>deep</HI> into Nati|onal
Con&s;equences; and di&s;cern at a Di&s;tance, the Fate of <HI>Mightine&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> have pre|tended to fore&s;ee
the &s;udden Downfall of <HI>Opera</HI>!&mdash;Who knows, if &s;uch a

qualify'd, Performers, may take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion <PB N="253" REF="262"> of
that de&s;erted Theatre; and, under the Au|&s;pices of &s;o noble, and &s;o
unanimous, a Board of Directors, out-do, even the &s;urprizing Things, which
have already been heard, and &s;een, there!</P>
<P>OR, &s;uppo&s;e, it were, <HI>yet, a Winter,</HI> before the <HI>Haymarket</HI> will be in a Condition to receive them: They cannot fail, in
the mean Time, to meet with more than rea&s;onable Encourage|ment, if they but
apply them&s;elves to the Ma|nagers, of either of our Theatres: In one, of
which, they labour under &s;uch a want of good Actors, that two &s;uch
accompli&s;h'd Comedians (having the Advantage, too, of being <HI>foreign</HI>

their Choice another Way; they may be entertain'd, as <HI>Friends,</HI> and <HI>Allies,</HI> up|on the Foot of well-paid Sub&s;idies; the Com|manding
Officers, of tho&s;e <HI>Veterans,</HI> entering, lately, with much Vivacity
upon New Plans of Action, which fall, immediately, within the Genius of our
fourfooted <HI>Virtuo&s;o</HI>'s.</P>
<P>HAVING barely touch'd this Hint for the Service of my
Corre&s;pondents, who are Per|&s;ons, of great Parts and Indu&s;try; I come now
to &s;ay a Word or two, in my own Per&s;on, to the Stages.</P>
<P>MUCH of the Summer is, yet, before us; and <HI>Winter,</HI> being the
Sea&s;on of our Theatri|cal Campaigning, I &s;hall prepare my&s;elf again&s;t 
<PB N="254" REF="263"> that Time, to take the Field, at their fir&s;t Marching:
and move, with one, or other of the Bodies, during the whole Cour&s;e of their
Operations. My Readers may then, expect to be entertain'd, from my private
Journal, with the Good, or Bad, Di&s;cipline, of both Armies: and the
Per&s;onal Conduct of their Generals, in the Exerci&s;es, Evolutions, Sallies,
Stratagems, or Engagements, they &s;hall, at any Time be concern'd
in.&mdash;Let 'em therefore &s;tand <HI>warn'd:</HI> and a&s;&s;ure
them&s;elves, that I &s;hall animadvert on their Behaviour, with a Frankne&s;s,
they have been little us'd to; and lay 'em Open, like a PLAIN DEALER.</P>
<P>BUT, to enter on another Subject, I have receiv'd &s;everal Letters,
from the Female Part of my Care, to complain of my <HI>Odious Title,</HI> (&s;o
they call it!) of PLAIN DEALER.&mdash;They had <HI>heard of me, it &s;eems, but
did not dream I had any Thing in me.&mdash;They took my Bu&s;ine&s;s to have
been Politicks.&mdash;They little thought me the Man they find
me.&mdash;In&s;tead of Humour, and Wit, they look'd for Bluntne&s;s, and
Malice, from a &s;urly, old, Fellow, that was &s;etting him|&s;elf up for a
Cynick,</HI>&mdash;with a great deal more, to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. But one
arch Flirt, among the Re&s;t, is for <HI>forcing</HI> me to <HI>declare</HI>
my&s;elf, that People may <HI>know, what to make of me.</HI> She is at a Lo&s;s
how to think, or what to &s;ay, of my Papers; and can neither <HI>like,</HI>
nor <HI>di&s;like,</HI> with any Manner of <HI>Certainty,</HI> till &s;he
hears, whether I am a <HI>Whig,</HI> or a <HI>Tory?</HI>&mdash;She adds, in a
Po&s;t&s;cript, 
<Q REND="inline">"That, perhaps, I may think <PB N="255" REF="264">
indifferently of <HI>both,</HI> and pretend to an Im|pudent <HI>Neutrality,</HI> like the Old Gra&s;ier, in our Civil Wars: who, when he
was met, on the Road, by Either of the oppo&s;ite Parties, and ask'd: <HI>For
King? Or for Parliament?</HI> told 'em.&mdash;<HI>For Neither: 'till both were
wi&s;er.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Hotheads,</HI> and <HI>Te&s;timonies,</HI> of this pre|&s;ent
Generation, think it a Di&s;grace to their Vivacity, not to be as briskly in
the Wrong, as their Ance&s;tors. And I pity, very heartily, the Condition of

<P><PB N="256" REF="265"> ABOUT Six a Clock, in the Morning on the <HI>Nine and Twentieth Day of</HI> May <HI>la&s;t,</HI> I, and my Waggon, were

&s;tuck all over with <HI>Oaken Boughs</HI>; and loaded with Branches of the
&s;ame.&mdash;They &s;topt me, in the Road, to know, <HI>Whe|ther I lov'd the
Memory of King</HI> Charles <HI>the Second.</HI>&mdash;I &s;aid, <HI>Yes, with
all my Soul.</HI>&mdash;At that Word, they fell a dancing, and &s;et up a loud <HI>Huzzaing:</HI> waving their Hats, and their Boughs, till my Team became
frighted, and took 'em all to be bewitch'd, and was within a Hair's Breadth of
running away with my Waggon. Then, they hand|ed me a two Quart Brandy-Bottle;
and bid me drink a Dram, <HI>To the Glorious Memory of the Re&s;toration:</HI>
And, as &s;oon as I had got it down, they gave a great Shout, again, &s;tuck my

hone&s;t Fellow:</HI> and had a <HI>Heart of Engli&s;h Oak.</HI> And, &s;o, we
parted, with much Ceremony, and Satisfaction, on both Sides.</P>
<P>BUT, before Eleven, the &s;ame Day, as I was driving into a Town,
where my Waggon was to <HI>Dine,</HI> there came up, in a great Rage, &s;even
or eight of the Troopers, that were quarter'd there; and ask'd me, <HI>What I
bu&s;h'd out my Hor&s;es for?</HI> I told 'em, <HI>To drive Flies away:</HI>
But they &s;aid I was a <HI>Jacobite Ra&s;cal,</HI>&mdash;that my <HI>Hor&s;es</HI> were guilty of <HI>High-Trea&s;on</HI>; and my Waggon ought
to be <PB N="257" REF="266"> <HI>hang'd.</HI>&mdash;I an&s;wer'd, That it was
already <HI>drawn</HI>; and within a Yard or two, of be|ing <HI>Quarter'd</HI>;
but as to being hang'd, It was a Compliment, we had no Occa&s;ion for, and
therefore de&s;ir'd them to take it back again, and keep it in their own Hands,
'till they had an Opportunity to make U&s;e of it:&mdash;I had no &s;ooner
&s;poke the&s;e Words, but they fell upon me, like Thun|der, &s;tript my Cattle
in a Twinkling; and beat me black and blue, with my own Oaken Branches.</P>
<P>THIS went off, and I thought no more of it: 'till the <HI>Tenth Day
of</HI> June <HI>came.</HI> I was then Inn'd in <HI>London</HI>; and, from
where my Waggon lay, in <HI>Holborn,</HI> I went to <HI>Soho Square,</HI> to
deliver a little Parcel, that I had brought up, for my Landlord's

out of her own Hand, a fine <HI>No&s;egay of White Ro&s;es.</HI> I was very
proud of my No&s;egay, for my Lady's Sake, that had given it me: And went along
the Street &s;melling to it, thinking all the Way as I walk'd, How pretty it
looks in your <HI>Gentry,</HI> to be &s;o free and good-natur'd with a poor
Man, as I am: When, all of a &s;udden, a Scarecrow, lean Man, in a fine lac'd
Coat, &s;natch'd it out of my Hand, and another Gentleman in red, who was along
with Him, <PB N="258" REF="267"> lent me a Cut cro&s;s the Shoulders, with a
cur&s;ed &s;marting Cane, and told me,&mdash;That he would teach &s;uch a dirty

<P>IF I could have got one of the&s;e fine Fel|lows all alone with me,

it was, I thought it be&s;t to &s;hew him a good Pair of Heels for

<P>I MADE a Vi&s;it, the other Day, to a Gen|tleman, who has a
Country-Hou&s;e, near <HI>London</HI>; and, while we refre&s;h'd our&s;elves
with a Social Gla&s;s, in a Summer Bower, which he has rais'd above the Corner
of his Garden-Wall, I ob&s;erv'd him to fix his Eyes, with much Attention, on
the Gate of a &s;tately Building, that &s;tood on the oppo&s;ite Side of the
Road.&mdash;The Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid he, of that fine Hou&s;e, has been
charming me, all this Morning, in a Poem, which was written, in Prai&s;e of her
Extraordinary Beauty, by a very celebrated, <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
Genius.&mdash;The warm, and lively, Imagination of the Poet has plac'd her
exactly before me! I feel, methinks, the Influence of her Eyes! I am inchanted,
by her Air and Movement!&mdash;But I lo&s;e my &s;elf in Rapture, while I
&s;eem to gaze upon <PB N="260" REF="269"> that Spring of Youth, which he
de&s;cribes with &s;o much Wantonne&s;s! That <HI>living, thinking,</HI> Bloom!
that quickens her &s;oft Languor; and adds Health, and Joy, to
Loveline&s;s.&mdash;But, &s;ee!&mdash;Look yonder! The very Charmer comes,
This! this! is &s;he: This gay, young, wi&s;h'd, ador'd dear Ma&s;ter-piece of
Nature; whom I have been reading of, with &s;o much Tran&s;port.</P>
<P>I STARTED up, in great Amazement; and, inflam'd by eager Curio&s;ity,
look'd out, to &s;ee this Prodigy.&mdash;But I beheld no other than a thin,
wither'd, &s;tooping, old Lady; whom Two Servants, with much &s;eeming
Difficulty, &s;upported; and were leading along, between them, toward a Coach,
that waited for her, at the Gate. Her Head, and both her Hands, &s;hook,
&s;trongly, with the Pal&s;ey; but every other Part &s;eem'd motionle&s;s, and
quite in&s;en|&s;ible.&mdash;I &s;igh'd at the Appearance of &s;o mortifying an
Object! And recall'd my Eyes, from aking at it, to fix 'em, reproachfully, upon
my Friend, for his ill-pointed Levity, in &s;porting with the Weakne&s;s, and
Mi&s;ery of Human Nature.&mdash;Yet <HI>This,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>was
once,</HI> &s;o chang'd as we now &s;ee her! that Di|vine! that Godlike! that
re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Miracle! whom, to contemplate, in <HI>Dryden</HI>'s warm
De|&s;cription of her Influence, when the Hearts of a gay Monarch, and a Court
of Rival Lovers, were the Trophies of her Beauty, <HI>Who</HI> cou'd think,
that Time wou'd thus re|duce her, to a <HI>Contradiction</HI> of all tho&s;e
flou|ri&s;hing <PB N="261" REF="270"> Attractions; which, though peri&s;h'd in
the chang'd Original, will bloom, for ever, in the Poet's Picture.</P>
<P>I PROTEST, the &s;udden Shock, which this malicious Artfulne&s;s of my
good Friend's Mo|rality &s;urpriz'd and &s;truck me with, quite damp'd, and
overwhelm'd my Chearfulne&s;s.&mdash;I &s;icken'd, at this <HI>too near</HI>
and <HI>naked</HI> View of Life, without its <HI>Palliatives.</HI>&mdash;I
re&s;olv'd to drink no more.&mdash;Your Wine, &s;aid I, has lo&s;t its
Reli&s;h, and your Society is grown in|&s;ipid; from the tingling Thoughts
which you have fill'd me with.&mdash;So, ri&s;ing for my Hat and Gloves, I took
my Leave abruptly, and walk'd homeward, cro&s;s the Fields, oppre&s;s'd with
mu&s;ing Melancholy.</P>
<P>I have not, to this Moment, lo&s;t the Weight of its Oppre&s;&s;ion;
and &s;hall never cea&s;e to wonder, That the <HI>Young</HI> reflect &s;o
&s;eldom on the Shortne&s;s of their Spring, when yet the <HI>Old</HI> are
always near us; and the <HI>Younger</HI> coming up behind, to pu&s;h us forward
into Winter.&mdash;It was a &s;harp and &s;tartling An|&s;wer, <HI>That</HI> of
the <HI>Armenian</HI> Beggar, who, leaning double on his Staff, was ask'd by a
young je&s;ting Coxcomb, How much that <HI>Bow</HI> had co&s;t him? For I wou'd
be glad, &s;aid he, to buy one&mdash;<HI>Have Patience,</HI> an&s;wer'd the old
Man, <HI>and, if God prolongs your Life, you will have as good a one for
nothing.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is but one Thing Here, that can de&s;erve our con&s;tant
Thoughts, and that is the very Thing, which we mo&s;t hate to think of! 
<PB N="262" REF="271">&mdash;What ought, &s;o frequently, to bu&s;y our
Remembrance, as the only &s;ure, and unavoid|able common Lot of ALL who ever
liv'd, who now do live; or who &s;hall live here|after?&mdash;Where are, now, <HI>Times pa&s;t?</HI>&mdash;We toil, and &s;trive, and labour on, through
Life, as if <HI>to live</HI> were our chief Bu&s;ine&s;s! Unmindful, all the
while, what empty Sha|dows we are gra&s;ping at; and for how &s;hort a Time,
and how uncertainly they can be Ours, when we have gain'd them. What is become
of all tho&s;e bu&s;y Bu&s;tlers, who have liv'd and died before us? Are they
not vani&s;hed, and forgotten? They have made their Way thro' Life, as an Eagle
does through Air; and their Path is clos'd up after them; nor have they left a
Track to follow by.</P>
<P>TIME is the greate&s;t of all <HI>Deceivers</HI>; but deceives us,
without <HI>flattering</HI> us.&mdash;It has a Tongue in every Steeple; and
points its Finger to the Dial's Shadow, to alarm and give us Notice. But we
neglect its hourly Summons; we tru&s;t its gentle Pace, again&s;t the
Har&s;hne&s;s of its Warning. Yet, were we wi&s;e, we &s;hould think Time a
&s;mooth, but precipitate Current, that carries us down to Death, whether we
are bound thither, or no: And <HI>He</HI> will, always, have the roughe&s;t
Pa&s;|&s;age, who, in&s;tead of gliding quietly, will be &s;truggling to &s;wim
again&s;t it.</P>
<P>LIFE has nothing, that is truly de&s;irable, but the Pre&s;ence of
tho&s;e we love; yet this, of all its Plea&s;ures, is mo&s;t precarious and 
<PB N="263" REF="272"> un&s;table.&mdash;Are we charm'd by the Power of <HI>Beauty?</HI> Let us learn from &s;uch an Object, as the once blooming Lady,
whom I have been &s;peaking of, that it is a fal&s;e and fluid
Pro&s;pect.&mdash;It is chang'd &s;ince Ye&s;terday; and will be further
chang'd, To-morrow.&mdash;<HI>All,</HI> that is <HI>Ours,</HI> is mutable. We
&s;till, in|deed, <HI>live on</HI>; but we are no longer what we have been, nor
can we continue what we are. Though the River is &s;till known by its old Name,
its Waters, To-day, are not the &s;ame Waters that were Ye&s;terday. Not our
Blood alone is flowing, and in con&s;tant Motion; our Faces, Strength, Health,
Comforts, Fears, Joys, Mi&s;eries, and Dangers, all move and mix us in one
Gulph, <HI>Eternity!</HI></P>
<P>I KNOW nothing &s;o <HI>ridiculous,</HI> as what is call'd being <HI>&s;erious:</HI> nor is any thing more <HI>idle,</HI> than what we u&s;ually
term <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI>&mdash;We wou'd be <HI>fortunate, lov'd, fear'd,
great,</HI> every thing, but what we <HI>&s;hou'd be:</HI>&mdash;For, whoever,
in this Life, propo&s;es to be com|pleatly happy, hopes to build, like the Men
of <HI>Babel</HI>; and wou'd rai&s;e a Pile, <HI>as high as Heaven,</HI>
without Foundation to erect it on. The World is too narrow to allow
Dimen&s;ions for a <HI>Ba&s;is,</HI> where the wild-intended Height is &s;o
unproportionably extravagant.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometans,</HI> who affect, after the an|cient Manner of the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Writers, to ex|pre&s;s their Moral Doctrine, in a kind of
pro|verbial Chain of Parallels; &s;ay, there are <HI>&s;ix</HI> Things which a
wi&s;e Man will ground no <PB N="264" REF="273"> Hopes on:&mdash;The Colour of
a Cloud, be|cau&s;e imaginary. The Friend&s;hip of the Co|vetous, becau&s;e
mercenary. The Love of Women, becau&s;e incon&s;tant. Beauty, be|cau&s;e frail.
Prai&s;e, becau&s;e airy: And, the Plea&s;ures of this World, becau&s;e
deceitful.</P>
<P>IT is equally to be wonder'd at, &s;ince Life is &s;o little valuable,
and Death &s;o certain, and unavoidable, 
<Q REND="inline">"That we &s;hould be &s;o unrea|&s;onably fond of the
One; and, &s;o fruitle&s;sly afraid of the Other."</Q> There is no Harbour on
this Side <HI>Death:</HI> And, the nearer we ap|proach to tho&s;e &s;hining
Follies, which we pur|&s;ue with &s;uch dangerous Eagerne&s;s, the more we
multiply our Cares, and di&s;tract and weary our own Purpo&s;es. The whole
Earth is not broad enough for two proud Fools to quarrel in! whereas <HI>Death</HI> is the End of Conte&s;t, the weary Man's Repo&s;e, the great
Man's Glory, the &s;ick Man's Health, the poor Man's Com|fort; and a Shelter
again&s;t Wrongs and Mi|&s;ery.</P>
<P>SINCE a Traveller can enjoy Plea&s;ure, by often thinking on his
Journey's End, while he is yet but upon the Road toward it; why might not Death
be made familiar to us, and di&s;rob'd of its fal&s;e Terrors, by accu&s;toming
our&s;elves to look out for it? To acquaint our &s;elves with it, at a
Di&s;tance, during our Jour|ney, through Life to it? Life is, properly, a
Journey; but differs from our other Journeys, of le&s;s Con&s;equence, in this
&s;urprizing Parti|cular, 
<Q REND="inline">"That we are travelling as fa&s;t, while 
<PB N="265" REF="274"> we are &s;leeping, and intend no Progre&s;s; as, when we
are awake, and know we are moving.</Q></P>
<P>LIFE, then, being a Journey, Death, I think, may be con&s;ider'd as an <HI>Inn</HI> at the <HI>Land's End:</HI> And, &s;ince the Traveller, when he
comes thither, is &s;till oblig'd to go farther; and mu&s;t &s;et out for
Di&s;coveries, upon a deep and unknown Ocean; if he takes not along with him,
fit Provi&s;ions for his Voyage, he mu&s;t be either a Fool or a Madman.</P>
<P>THE Difference between the <HI>Great</HI> Man, and the <HI>Good</HI>
Man, is never &s;o plainly &s;een as when they, both, come to <HI>die.</HI>
Then, the one &s;huts his Eyes; and &s;teps, trembling, and in the Dark, into
the Dreadfulne&s;s of Uncer|tainty: While the other &s;miles, with Joy, up|on
the Enlargement of his opening Pro&s;pect; and comes, out of a miry Labyrinth,
into Day-light, and a boundle&s;s <HI>Champian!</HI>&mdash;I &s;ometimes take
Plea&s;ure to con&s;ider the Birth of Man, as a Commitment of his Soul to
Pri|&s;on; where, during the Life of the Body, it is chain'd &s;hort, and can
move but a creeping Pace; and in limited and dusky Stages. But, it is &s;et
free, and unfetter'd, by Death, and, at one Spring, reaches Heaven.&mdash;Such
Di&s;|charge is, to the Soul, what Light is, to the Eye; when it opens Colours,
and Objects, which before, were conceal'd in Darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus, then, when it is &s;aid, we <HI>die,</HI> we are rather <HI>born</HI> into real Being; we are infran|chis'd, by the Grant of Death, and
incorpo|rated <PB N="266" REF="275"> among the Millions upon Millions, who have
died before us. Tho&s;e we leave, are a Number, very &s;mall and
incon&s;iderable, in Compari&s;on with tho&s;e we go to. The Patri|archs, the
Prophets, the Apo&s;tles, the heroick Conquerors, the &s;hining Poets of
Antiqui|ty, and the whole, a&s;&s;embled Congre&s;s, of long-known and
glorious, Characters, who have flouri&s;h'd, from the World's Creati|on, are to
be the Company, to who&s;e fami|liar Conver&s;e <HI>Death</HI> will introduce
us.&mdash;And, that we may add one charming Hope, to warm and &s;weeten, all
the re&s;t! <HI>There,</HI> too, we &s;hall, perhaps, embrace, and be
re&s;tor'd to, tho&s;e lo&s;t Friends, we lov'd, mo&s;t dearly: and whom we
never more expected to have met with.</P>
<P>BUT, I will, now, relieve my Readers from the Severity of the&s;e
Reflections, by entertaining them with a Copy of Ver&s;es; which, I am
a&s;&s;ur'd, were, really, written to a Lady, eminent for her Wit, and Beauty:
by a Gentleman, who thought it no Di&s;grace to her Loveline&s;s, to mix his
Admiration of it, with the Memory, that &s;he was mortal.</P>

your <HI>Ancients, Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> put to|gether.&mdash;I
love him at my Heart, and have mo&s;t of his Lectures <HI>without Book.</HI>
And, I am &s;ure, he is profoundly skill'd in my dear Love's Di&s;temper, by
this feeling Force, with which he &s;peaks of it: 
<Q> 
<L>Oh, Jealou&s;y!&mdash;All other Storms are <HI>Calms</HI></L> 
<L>To <HI>Thee!</HI>&mdash;Thou <HI>Conflagration</HI> of the
Soul!</L> </Q> </P>
<P>THAT Word <HI>Conflagration,</HI> is the very Picture of my <HI>Fub&s;y</HI>'s Symptoms!&mdash;I had prepared, from the Salutary Works of
this learned Gentleman, a healing <HI>Linctus,</HI> that I thought infallible,
if my afflicted Deary cou'd be per&s;uaded but to apply her Tongue to it now
and then, in order to dulcify her picquant Palate, when the acid Particles
&s;hould ri&s;e too vehemently. I had got it ready written, upon a Sheet of her
own gilt Paper; and the la&s;t Time &s;he was taken, I gave it kindly into her
Hands, and de&s;ired her to apply it moderately. She look'd it over, with great
Compo&s;ure; and I began to conceive &s;uch Hope, that I took up an unta&s;ted <HI>Sillabub,</HI> that had ju&s;t been &s;et be|fore us, and intreated her, if
the Phy&s;ick was too bitter, that &s;he would wa&s;h down the Ta&s;te of it,
with a Sip or two of that emollient Sweetner. But the Spout was no &s;ooner
within a Foot of her pretty Lips, when the <HI>Conflagration,</HI>
abovemention'd, <PB N="275" REF="284"> blaz'd out at both her Eyes; and, with a
frightful flaming Face, &s;he tore the <HI>Recipe</HI> in a thou&s;and Pieces;
and burnt &s;o &s;trong, and &s;o outragiou&s;ly, that, fearing I &s;hould be
&s;corch'd as &s;he flew toward me, and not be|ing, ju&s;t then, provided with
one of Mr. <HI>God|frey</HI>'s <HI>Chymical Extingui&s;hers,</HI> I had no Way
left to quench the Fire, but by Affu&s;ion of my <HI>Sillabub</HI>; which, very
fortunately, <HI>put her out,</HI> by the Copiou&s;ne&s;s of its Adhe&s;ion.
But I was &s;o frighted at the Ebullition that en&s;ued immediately upon it,
that I ran away as fa&s;t as I was able; having left her a good deal cool'd,
and in a fair Way to be extin|gui&s;h'd.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT it proper to give you this Intelligence, how far I have
fail'd, that Doctor <HI>Jyngle</HI> may come, prepar'd, with more powerful, and
&s;earching Remedies.&mdash;Let him make but a thorough Cure, and I'll warrant
him we do his Bu&s;ine&s;s. There are Nine-and-Thirty Ladies of Quality, of my <HI>Fub&s;y</HI>'s particular Acquaintance, who are All down, at this very
Time, of the &s;elf-&s;ame Di&s;temper; and All taken, too, with the <HI>Conflagration,</HI> exactly as &s;he, her|&s;elf, is. He &s;hall never want
good Patients, if his <HI>Emeticks</HI> but go to the Bottom.&mdash;I am, in no
&s;mall Impatience,</P>

<P>IT is &s;aid, that <HI>England,</HI> within this la&s;t Century, is

<P>I NEVER wak'd in more Harmony, and Compo&s;ure of Mind, than I did
Ye&s;terday Morning; when, ri&s;ing chearfully, with my Spirits more diffu&s;ed
than ordinary, I vi&s;ited my Friend the <HI>Major,</HI> who&s;e Face, as often
as I &s;ee it, makes me happier than I was be|fore. From his firm, and &s;teady
Temper, I learn to break the Force of my Di&s;appoint|ments, by the Patience
with which I receive them: And I am taught, by his Genero&s;ity, to feel the
Weight of no Misfortunes, but tho&s;e which oppre&s;s my Friends, whom I love,
without being able to comfort.&mdash;When I &s;ee this Gentleman de&s;pi&s;ing,
and even adorning <PB N="280" REF="289"> him&s;elf by, his Afflictions, I am
a&s;hamed to have ever murmured, or con&s;idered my own as burthen&s;ome.</P>
<P>I FOUND this faithful Friend reading one of my printed Papers, and
entertaining his lit|tle Family, with all the Chearfulne&s;s of the
Fortunate.&mdash;He ro&s;e, and received me, &s;miling. I have been Rea&s;oning
away &s;ome Pain, &s;aid he, by the Influence of your PLAIN DEALER. How
powerful are your Thoughts? And how happy am I in your Friend&s;hip? What a
Force of Delight comes with the Prai&s;e of tho&s;e we love? It is Mu&s;ick to
the Mind, and our Cares di&s;&s;olve before it.</P>
<P>THE generous Fulne&s;s of his Heart, was prepared to &s;ay much more,
if I had not in|terrupted him, by propo&s;ing a Walk into the Fields.&mdash;It
was one of tho&s;e &s;weet, &s;unle&s;s Days, when, though no Place was
&s;helter'd, yet every Place would be &s;hady. We had wander'd, without
de&s;igning it, 'till we found our&s;elves by <HI>Chel&s;ea-College.</HI> The
Grandeur, U&s;e, and Beauty of that Building, charm'd us into a &s;hort
Silence, which the <HI>Major</HI> broke agreeably, by the&s;e apt, and ju&s;t,
Reflections.</P>
<P>THOUGH <HI>Charity</HI> is la&s;t in Rank, when we name the three
great Virtues, it &s;tands fir&s;t, methinks, in Dignity; for it &s;eems to
include the others. There may be <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Hope,</HI> where there
is no <HI>Charity</HI>; but there can be no <HI>Charity</HI> without <HI>both.</HI> It imploys <HI>Faith</HI> in the ea&s;y Credit which it allows
to affirm'd and rational Appearances: And it applies <PB N="281" REF="290"> <HI>Hope</HI> to its own, and others Benefit, by in|dulging an Expectation,
that all that is ami&s;s, will mend; and Ills produce good Con&s;equen|ces. The
common Notion of this Virtue, centers in a contracted Beneficence toward the
Support of the Poor and Needy: And that, too, for the mo&s;t Part, when the
Be&s;tower has no longer the Power of enjoying what he parts with. Whereas <HI>Charity,</HI> in its noble&s;t Sen&s;e, requires a Return of <HI>good
Offices,</HI> to the very Malice that oppre&s;&s;es us: For, it teaches us not
only to <HI>act well,</HI> but al&s;o to <HI>think generou&s;|ly.</HI>&mdash;It
bani&s;hes from the human Soul, all its &s;ordid Affections; All Partiality to
our own Intere&s;ts; All Attachment to our own Opinions; All Jealou&s;ies, and
low Su&s;picions, concerning the De&s;igns, Words, and Actions, of tho&s;e we
hear of, or conver&s;e with. It is, in &s;hort, the great Refiner, and Ennobler
of the Mind: It &s;wells the Heart with Pity, Friend&s;hip, Ju&s;tice, Pardon,
Openne&s;s, and Magnanimity; And &s;tifles the inward Strug|lings of
Self-preference, Revenge, Di&s;tru&s;t, Pride, Avarice, and Ignorance.</P>
<P>THOUGH it is certain, an&s;wered I, That <HI>Charity,</HI> at full
Extent, is no le&s;s than you de&s;cribe her; yet, even in the Sen&s;e mo&s;t
li|mitted, her Influence is &s;weet, and amiable. How wretched would many
Thou&s;ands be, through want of the mo&s;t common Comforts, if O&s;tentation
did not borrow the white Robe of Charity, to di&s;gui&s;e her Pride of Heart,
in the Appearance of Humility! And if the <PB N="282" REF="291"> Mi&s;er, on
the Brink of Life, did not fill his trembling Hands with Benefits, that ble&s;s
the De&s;titute as effectually, as if his Will, and not his Penitence, had
urged him to be&s;tow them!</P>
<P>HOW many want the Pity, which even an Ho&s;pital can give them? How
many return hungry, cold, weary, di&s;appointed, and de|&s;pairing, to their
fami&s;h'd, and unfriended Children? What double Death would it be to an
unhoping, wanting Husband, to &s;ee the Brea&s;t of a lov'd Wife dry'd up with
killing Want; and a dying Infant held, in vain, to her in&s;en&s;ible,
exhau&s;ted Bo&s;om?&mdash;I know, you feel not that you can be mi&s;erable,
'till you think of the <HI>more mi&s;erable:</HI> And I &s;hould not,
therefore, haunt &s;o apprehen&s;ive a Re|flection, with Apparitions of
imagined Sorrow. But, how frequent would &s;uch Lots become, if not prevented
by the <HI>late,</HI> indeed, yet al|ways <HI>welcome,</HI> Bounty, of tho&s;e
Founders, even of our common Hou&s;es of Compa&s;&s;ion? Our Monuments of
Death-Bed Bribery! to which, for the Example's &s;ake, <HI>This</HI> World
allows the Name of Charity!</P>
<P>IT has been remarked, but, I hope, it was unju&s;tly, That the Charity
of Women is much narrower than that of Men.&mdash;If this is true, it is an
Accident which mu&s;t be owing to &s;ome Error in their Education; for Nature
meant it otherwi&s;e, and &s;often'd their tender Minds, to fit them for
Impre&s;&s;ions of a mild, and pity|ing Quality.&mdash;In all the Sculptures,
and fine Paintings of Antiquity, we &s;ee Charity repre|&s;ented 
<PB N="283" REF="292"> as a &s;miling <HI>Woman,</HI> to &s;hew, it is the <HI>Sex's Virtue</HI>; and, that Sweetne&s;s, Grace, and Bounty, &s;hould adorn
a Lady's Loveline&s;s.&mdash;When I &s;ee a Woman fortunate, yet narrow-minded,
and unmerciful, I look with Scorn upon her Beauty, and think mo&s;t upon the
Dro&s;s it covers. I grow angry at beholding &s;uch a gay and gilded Sepulchre,
and turn my Eyes from her &s;hining Du&s;t, to the more grate|ful Earth, which
it was taken from.</P>
<P>HOW different, replied the <HI>Major,</HI> from &s;uch a Woman as you
are de&s;cribing, is the charming <HI>Belvidera?</HI> I have &s;een her lovely
Features, which give new Joy to the <HI>Trium|phant,</HI> langui&s;h, and look
comfortle&s;s, when &s;he has heard of the <HI>Unhappy.</HI>&mdash;Her Voice,
which wakes the Soul, and calls it up into the Ear, with all the Mu&s;ick of a
Trumpet, falls, and trembles, when &s;he talks of Wretchedne&s;s, which &s;he
is &s;en&s;ible &s;he cannot remedy. The Numbers whom &s;he obliges, have two
Rival Benefactors, which divide and perplex their Gratitude; for they know not
which mo&s;t merits it, her <HI>Manner,</HI> or her <HI>Bounty.</HI>&mdash;To
&s;uch a &s;weet Exce&s;s of Tenderne&s;s does <HI>Belvi|dera</HI> rai&s;e her
Charity, that &s;he would be old, un&s;een, unlovely, rather than adorable, as
&s;he now is; becau&s;e &s;he <HI>pains,</HI> where &s;he mu&s;t <HI>on|ly
pity.</HI>&mdash;She is, at once, the mo&s;t charming, and lea&s;t con&s;cious,
of all Women!</P>
<P>WHILE we were &s;peaking of her, we were &s;urprized in the mo&s;t
agreeable Manner po&s;|&s;ible, by the Sight of her Chariot pa&s;&s;ing us. 
<PB N="284" REF="293">&mdash;She bowed very humbly, and order'd it to &s;top;
and, while her Servants retir'd, with a Politene&s;s and Sen&s;ibility, which I
have very &s;eldom remark'd in Per&s;ons of their low Con|dition, &s;he
receiv'd us with an Air of Sweetne&s;s, that re&s;embled the Idea which we have
of a de&s;cending Angel.&mdash;She lamented, that &s;he was in her Chariot;
becau&s;e her Coach, &s;he &s;aid, might have held us all; &s;he wou'd,
there|fore, <HI>leave</HI> it, to ble&s;s our Walk. The Major offer'd her his
Arm; at which I felt a kind of fooli&s;h Envy, which I knew not how to
re|concile with my growing Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Patty Amble.</HI></P>
<P>HOW attractive is Beauty, when it is &s;of|ten'd by the humble&s;t
Mode&s;ty, and yet dig|nify'd by Wit and Maje&s;ty!&mdash;She bu&s;ied and
delighted my Soul; and I was &s;o tran&s;|ported by her Voice and Sentiments,
that I fell in Love with my own Silence, becau&s;e it pro|long'd the Plea&s;ure
of her Speaking.</P>
<P>WE were join'd in this Place, very unex|pectedly, by <HI>Ned
Volatile,</HI> who had enquir'd for us at the <HI>Major</HI>'s, and rambled
hither in pur&s;uit of us. He had never &s;een <HI>Belvidera,</HI> nor &s;o
much as knew who &s;he was, yet came up with his u&s;ual Air, of brisk
A&s;&s;urance and Sufficiency.&mdash;<HI>What!</HI> cry'd he, <HI>my Old
Friends engag'd in a Confederacy again&s;t my Li|berty!</HI> Then he retreated,
with a kind of counterfeit A&s;toni&s;hment, and, lowering his Voice, went on
thus, looking, with a genteel Levity, upon the Lady; <HI>I don't know,
Ma|dam,</HI> <PB N="285" REF="294"> <HI>what unde&s;erv'd good Opinion you may
have, of the&s;e grave Gentlemen; but I &s;hall never be brought to think
patiently of 'em again.&mdash;'Twas ungenerous, and unpardonable, to give a
poor Wretch no Warning; but draw him in, with an unguarded Brea&s;t, to &s;tand
the Mark of all the&s;e Charms, where it is impo&s;&s;ible but I mu&s;t fall by
&s;ome of 'em!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Believe me, Sir,</HI> reply'd <HI>Belvidera,</HI> with a Mixture
of Di&s;dain and Compa&s;&s;ion; <HI>The Danger you complain of, is too &s;mall
to excu&s;e your Terror.&mdash;However open your Heart may lie, few fir&s;t
Blows reach thither.&mdash;If you are wounded at Sight, the Hurt was only in
your Eyes; and the Armour, you &s;hould have been defended by, was not a
Brea&s;t-Plate, but a Head-Piece.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL never forget, with what an Air of Surprize and Awe, poor <HI>Ned Volatile</HI> &s;tart|ed back, at the piercing Voice of <HI>Belvidera,</HI> and from the &s;miling Sharpne&s;s of her Satire: But I
love the young Rogue's Virtue; and, I own, my Heart triumph'd for him, under
the Mortification of this Retreat; for it &s;ate on him, methought, more
gracefully, than all his natural Gayety.</P>
<P>HE kept behind us all the Way, in a &s;in|cere and becoming
Confu&s;ion, li&s;tning, atten|tively, to <HI>Belvidera,</HI> without one
Attempt to Rally: But I ob&s;erv'd him, at length, draw out his Pocket-Book
with a Sigh; in which, he writ for Three or Four Minutes, and then, giving it
into my Hands, I found he had been <PB N="286" REF="295"> penning down his <HI>Dying Speech,</HI> with a woful Warning to all Chri&s;tian People, to take
Ex|ample by his Suffering.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Let ra&s;h, young Fools for what I now endure,</L> 
<L>Learn, never to believe their Hearts &s;ecure:</L> 
<L>Once, O ye Gay! a &s;triking Hour may come,</L> 
<L>When Mirth &s;hall cea&s;e to &s;mile; and Wit grow dumb!</L> 
<L>The light, low Je&s;t! the giddy Repartee!</L>

<L>When <HI>Love's</HI> warm Hand &s;hall wake the wond'ring Heart,</L>

<L>Oh! <HI>Love!</HI>&mdash;from Midnight Mirth, Wit, Friends, and
Wine,</L> 
<L>Take my &s;natch'd Soul, from this &s;oft Moment Thine.</L> </Q>
<P>I COU'D not re&s;i&s;t the Temptation I was under, to make Atonement
for <HI>Ned</HI>'s Imper|tinence, by pre&s;enting his Poetick Penitence to the
Divine <HI>Belvidera:</HI> She perus'd it with a con&s;cious Blu&s;h, and an
Air of eloquent Di&s;|order, which has given a reviving Hope to the
Di&s;tre&s;s of her new Lover. But it robb'd us too &s;oon of her Company; for
&s;he took Leave pre&s;ently after, and, permitting her Hand to <HI>Ned
Volatile,</HI> &s;tept, again, into her Chariot, and left us, melancholy, and
di&s;&s;a|tisfy'd.</P>
<P>THE Major and I, were for returning to our fir&s;t Subject, and had
re&s;um'd the Di&s;|cour&s;e of Charity; but <HI>Ned</HI> would have no|thing
but Love. His whole Soul was fill'd <PB N="287" REF="296"> with the Image of <HI>Belvidera:</HI> And a Pa&s;&s;ion, which, 'till now, he cou'd never mention
&s;e|riou&s;ly, was become, on a &s;udden, the darling Theme of his
Conver&s;ation.&mdash;Groves, Brooks, and <HI>Belvidera,</HI> were the Objects
of his ena|mour'd Fancy.&mdash;Silence, Thought, Shade, Solitude, Things which
he had never before a Notion of, pre&s;ented them&s;elves to his Ima|gination,
as the mo&s;t de&s;irable Delights of Na|ture.&mdash;The Major oblig'd him
beyond Ac|knowledgment, and won all that remain'd of his Heart, by talking to
him of a Poem, which he cou'd &s;hew him, when he came Home, call'd, <HI>The
Picture of Love</HI>; and repeating out of it &s;ome Lines, the mo&s;t adapted
to <HI>Ned</HI>'s new Circum&s;tances.</P>
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>Cautious, ye Fated! who frequent the Fair,</L>
<L>Your Brea&s;ts examine, nor too ra&s;hly <HI>dare.</HI></L>
<L>Curb your untru&s;ted Hearts, while yet they're free:</L>

they rai&s;e their ob&s;cure Neighbours, to bright Images of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>ALL Per&s;ons, who are Favourites of For|tune, who &s;hine in exalted

a Multiplicity of Dependents, have the Ble&s;&s;ing, I have been &s;peaking of,

<P>A GOOD Ma&s;ter may be con&s;ider'd as the Soul of his Family, who

giddily vain and unthink|ing by too much Pro&s;perity, who <HI>dream,</HI> that
People of low Condition, ought to be over|look'd; and that <HI>Servants,</HI>
becau&s;e <HI>Servants,</HI> &s;hould not be treated as of the &s;ame Species

Under&s;tandings abundant|ly too coar&s;e to be come at by Railery: They ought
to be bluntly told, That <HI>good Servants</HI> might make <HI>good

them&s;elves appear to be de&s;titute. They ought in very plain Terms, to be

Fortune, without Demerit of theirs, had placed them <HI>&s;eemingly</HI>
lower.</P>
<P>A LOW and ob&s;cure Birth has been often the Lot of a high, and noble
Spirit. It &s;eems to be the Victory of <HI>Nature</HI> over <HI>Fortune,</HI>
that &s;he can produce &s;uch valuable Creatures, in <PB N="291" REF="300"> the
mo&s;t abject <HI>State</HI> of Servitude: A <HI>Plain-Dealing,</HI> faithful
Servant is a Jewel of ine&s;ti|mable Value.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> due to hone&s;t Men, on ac|count of their
Poverty, mu&s;t, after having ap|proved their Integrity, be refin'd into <HI>Regard,</HI> and <HI>E&s;teem.</HI> I have, for this Rea&s;on,

Dome&s;tick, <HI>rather like a</HI> Friend <HI>than a</HI> Servant. And truly,
it is far from impo&s;&s;ible, but that a Ma&s;ter may &s;tand in need of
&s;uch a Servant for his Friend, and find him, upon Trial, a much better, than
tho&s;e incon&s;tant Comrades, whom the World, in their mi&s;taken Phra&s;e,
would be apt to call <HI>his Betters.</HI></P>
<P>I LATELY had a Story told me to this Pur|po&s;e, and if it affects the
Reader, as it did me, he will not be di&s;plea&s;ed, that I give it him by way
of Example.</P>
<P>A GENTLEMAN named <HI>Belmont</HI>; a Per|&s;on of Di&s;tinction,
filled an honourable Po&s;t in the Army, and behaved him&s;elf well during the
late Wars in <HI>Flanders.</HI> He is Hone&s;t, Brave, Hearty, Sincere,
Generous, and Affa|ble; was generally courted for his Company by his Brother
Officers, and univer&s;ally be|loved by his Soldiers. In tho&s;e Sun&s;hine
Days of his Pro&s;perity, <HI>Belmont</HI> held dear, as his Bo&s;om-Intimate,
a Gentleman, by Name, <HI>Cel|&s;us</HI>; and had one particular Servant, whom,
<PB N="292" REF="301"> on account of many rare Qualities, he loved above the
re&s;t, and treated as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bruyere</HI> advi&s;es, and whom, for the
Sake of his Fide|lity to his Ma&s;ter, we will call <HI>Fido.</HI></P>
<P><HI>BELMONT,</HI> and <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> lived, indeed, like true
Friends: And, as if each thought the other's Intere&s;t his own, they
commutually, as Exigences on either Side required, furni&s;hed one another with
Money, and de&s;ired no In|tere&s;t or Security. At length, when they had long
loved and lived together, <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> was called to another Quarter:
Never did Soul and Body part with more Reluctancy than the&s;e Friends, being <HI>le&s;s</HI> certain when, and where, and how, they &s;hould meet again.
Much about the &s;ame Time, <HI>Fido,</HI> having been bred to a Trade, and got
a little Stock by his Ma&s;ter, had Thoughts of &s;etting up in the World. His
Ma&s;ter, when he di&s;charged him, added to the Salary he paid him, a
hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent, and wi&s;hed him good Fortune, with &s;uch Familiarity
and Conde&s;cen&s;ion, as made the <HI>Wi&s;h</HI> more endearing than the <HI>Pre&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this, if we behold <HI>Belmont,</HI> it mu&s;t be under a Cloud
of Evils: He met with cro&s;s and &s;evere Accidents which reduced him to
narrower Circum&s;tances, than &s;uited &s;o liberal a Soul: He, who delighted
in extricating others out of Troubles and Perplexities, was, at length,
involv'd in Difficulties him&s;elf. In a word, his Affairs were brought to that
Ex|tremity, that a certain Sum mu&s;t be punctually paid on &s;uch a Day, or <HI>Belmont</HI> be expo&s;ed to <PB N="293" REF="302"> &s;uch an indecent
Di&s;tre&s;s, as it is painful but to think of.</P>
<P>MANY Mea&s;ures he had try'd, in vain, to make Provi&s;ion again&s;t
it: He was acquaint|ed with many Per&s;ons of Fa&s;hion, who had been lavi&s;h
of their Vows of Friend&s;hip, and profu&s;e, even to Prodigality, in offering
him their Services, at Times, when they well knew there was no Danger in the
Offer. He tried them all in their Turns: And found them, all, fal&s;e
alike.</P>
<P>HOW will it go with poor <HI>Belmont,</HI> who has the Ill-luck of
&s;uch Acquaintance? why, the Reader will be plea&s;ed to hear, That <HI>Cel|&s;us</HI> is return'd to <HI>England,</HI> as much in the Abundance,
as <HI>Belmont</HI> in the Want of all Things, and &s;ettled within a Mile or
two of <HI>London.</HI> On him were <HI>Belmont</HI>'s Eyes turn'd from the
&s;ad Scene that threaten'd him: Here he is &s;ure to be right; Here his
Addre&s;s mu&s;t prevail: I fancy my&s;elf walking over the Fields with <HI>Belmont</HI>; I hear him &s;ay, he is no longer to groan under his
Misfortunes, than till they can reach the Ear of <HI>Cel&s;us</HI>; They want
no|thing towards being reliev'd, but being bare|ly laid before him: Then <HI>Belmont</HI> is to a&s;to|ni&s;h him with the Fal&s;hood and Meanne&s;s of
his other Acquaintance. Thus &s;oothing his Imagination, he arrives at the
Hou&s;e of <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> is receiv'd with the Warmth of Friend&s;hip; he
opens his Complaint, and tells the Story of the U&s;age he had met with. Here
the Reader will be &s;tunn'd&mdash;the Story was as unprofita|ble 
<PB N="294" REF="303"> in the Ear of <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> as if their
Friend&s;hip, had been a Fable.</P>
<P>AS <HI>Belmont</HI> was returning home cro&s;s the Fields, loaded with
heavy Reflections, with whom &s;hould he meet, but his old Man <HI>Fido!</HI>
walking out with an Intention to lie that Night at his Country-Lodgings, for
the Benefit of the Air. <HI>Fido</HI> would walk back, part of the Way with his
Ma&s;ter: And finding him very melancholy, implored him to tell the Cau&s;e of
it.&mdash;At length <HI>Belmont,</HI> half &s;miling, &s;aid, Thou can'&s;t not
help me in it, hone&s;t <HI>Fido</HI>; and yet, with a Sigh, &s;aid he, now I
think on't, I will tell thee, for thou knowe&s;t <HI>Cel&s;us.</HI>&mdash;Thou
mu&s;t remember him.&mdash;Sir, reply'd <HI>Fido,</HI> and ever
&s;hall.&mdash;I can't forget your be&s;t Friend: I hope he is not
dead!&mdash;<HI>Belmont</HI> told him the whole Story: Ju&s;t as he had
fini&s;h'd it; they reach a little publick Hou&s;e on the
Road&mdash;<HI>Fido,</HI> without an&s;wering, begg'd him to walk in, called
for Pen, Ink, and Paper, and wrote a Note for the Money, and giving it his
Ma|&s;ter, &s;aid thus; <HI>I am glad at my Heart it was a Sum within my Power,
without breaking in upon my Stock, becau&s;e I &s;hould have parted with it
All; for, Sir, I owe it All to you.</HI></P>
<P>LET us con&s;ider <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> and <HI>Fido, Cel&s;us</HI> a
Friend and a Companion; <HI>Fido</HI> a Menial Ser|vant: <HI>Fido</HI> a Weaver
of fine Silks, <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> a Wearer of finer; how then &s;hall we
reconcile this Matter, That <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> after all this Diffe|rence in
Sub&s;tance and Figure, &s;hould be on|ly Gentleman in <HI>Appearance,
Fido</HI> in <HI>Reality?</HI> <PB N="295" REF="304"> It is ea&s;y to an&s;wer,
that the Stage of Life is like the Theatre, where the principal Parts acted,
are not always the be&s;t: It is not <HI>what</HI> Part we act, but <HI>how</HI> we act it, that gives us Applau&s;e. I have frequently known a
Ser|vant the chief Ornament of a Play: It is the &s;ame in the World; where

<P>I AM never more delighted, than when I meet with an Opportunity to
unveil ob|&s;cure Merit, and produce it into Notice: There being nothing that
more ea&s;ily deceives us, than our Judgment on the Wit and Learn|ing of a
Cotemporary Writer, when we take not our Mea&s;ure from our own Examination,
but rely on the Authority of Publick Rumour.</P>
<P>A PLEASANT Vein, a bu&s;y, medling Ta|lent, Acquaintance, Importunity,
Preferment, or any outward and accidental Advantage, &s;hall throw forward an
a&s;&s;uming Trifler into Di&s;tinction and Popularity: While a great, 
<PB N="296" REF="305"> and mode&s;t Genius is neglected and unfam'd; becau&s;e
not One in Fifty, of our Men of Fa|&s;hion, or of Quality, as they call
them&s;elves, has an Under&s;tanding that is able to <HI>go alone.</HI> They
are forc'd, therefore, to wait 'till they have their Su&s;tainer's Opinion to
lean again&s;t, before they dare venture upon the Prai&s;e, even of what they
are inclinable to think favoura|bly of, as far as poor, weak <HI>Wards,</HI>
can pre|&s;ume <HI>to think at all,</HI> who&s;e Wits are out in
Guardian&s;hip, and under other Mens Di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>IT is owing to the Multiplicity of the&s;e overgrown <HI>Infants,</HI>
that our Eyes and Ears are fatigu'd by &s;uch Impertinence of mi&s;taken <HI>Encomium.</HI> In&s;omuch, that, to tho&s;e who in|&s;pect the Things and
Per&s;ons which are mo&s;t prai&s;ed among us, we appear a Nation of <HI>Grote&s;que Thinkers,</HI> who&s;e Idea of our Writers Excellence, like the <HI>Dutchmens</HI> Ta&s;te of <HI>Paint|ing,</HI> &s;eems to be Nature, in a
Fit of Di&s;tor|tion, where <HI>Grimace</HI> is placed for <HI>Dignity.</HI></P>
<P>BY a Cu&s;tom, that has prevailed too much, &s;ince the chearful Times
of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, when they ran into the contrary <HI>Ex|treme</HI> to that which they had <HI>&s;uffer'd by,</HI> and confounded
the <HI>Serious</HI> with the <HI>Humorous,</HI> treating the mo&s;t &s;olemn
Subjects after a light and wanton Manner, we have e&s;tabli&s;hed a fal&s;e
Ta&s;te of Wit, which has in&s;en&s;ibly, like an unnoted Current, declin'd us
from our right Cour&s;e, and brought us &s;o far out of our Way, that it will
be &s;ome Time before we find our|&s;elves re&s;tored to our old
Reli&s;h.&mdash;The &s;len|der <PB N="297" REF="306"> Shape of the Modern
Mu&s;e, is made for becoming the <HI>Hoop-Petticoat</HI>; but there was a
charming, maje&s;tick <HI>Nakedne&s;s</HI> in that ner|vous Simplicity, and
plain Soundne&s;s of <HI>pa|thetick Nature,</HI> which went to the <HI>Hearts</HI> of our Forefathers, without &s;topping at their <HI>Fan|cy,</HI> or winding it&s;elf into their Under&s;tanding, through a Maze
of my&s;tical Prettine&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT, though this venerable, <HI>undre&s;s'd Na|ture,</HI> is &s;eldom
to be met with now; and has, indeed, been lo&s;t among us, for above a <HI>Cen|tury,</HI> it was &s;o frequent Two or Three hun|dred Years ago, that
their lowe&s;t Cla&s;s of Poets, the Compo&s;ers of our good Old Ballads, have
left us &s;ome of the noble&s;t Examples of the <HI>Sub|lime,</HI> in its
mo&s;t &s;triking Energy. But, in the pre&s;ent Practice, it is &s;tifled, as
the <HI>Roman</HI> Maid was, under the Oppre&s;&s;ion of Golden Ear|rings,
Bracelets, Jewels, and heap'd Heavi|ne&s;&s;es of the <HI>Gothick Armory.</HI>
Yet, now and then, we &s;tart upon it in the Writings of our Modern Poets; as I
did, the other Day, in an <HI>Ode, on the Power of Mu&s;ick,</HI> which was
writ|ten by a young <HI>Scots</HI> Gentleman, who has conveyed, in a naked
Grandeur, and in the ut|mo&s;t Degree of Plainne&s;s, the following awe|ful
Thought, which carries a Terror, that will &s;hake the Soul of every attentive
Reader.</P>
<Q> 
<L>When Living Men &s;hall die, and Dead Men live,</L> 
<L>And <HI>Order</HI> is, again, to <HI>Chaos</HI> hurl'd;</L> 
<L>Thou, <HI>Melody!</HI> &s;halt &s;till &s;urvive,</L>

<L><PB N="298" REF="307">A dreadful Trumpet, never heard before,</L>

<L><HI>That</HI> Time <HI>is now no more!</HI></L> </Q>
<P>BUT the Accident, which has drawn me in|to this Lamentation for the
Lo&s;s of <HI>Nature,</HI> in our Works of Wit and Poetry, where &s;he ought
mo&s;t to &s;hew her&s;elf, is, my having taken up, in a late Perambulation, as
I &s;tood upon the Top of <HI>Primro&s;e-Hill,</HI> a torn Leaf of one of
tho&s;e Half-penny Mi&s;cellanies, which are publi&s;hed for the U&s;e and
Plea&s;ure of our <HI>Nymphs of low Degree,</HI> and known by the Name of <HI>Garlands</HI>&mdash;That Part of it, which fir&s;t caught my Eye, had its
Turn a little too <HI>Modern,</HI> as well in the Matter, as the Poetry, and
celebrated the Midnight Triumphs of &s;ome <HI>&s;traggling Female,</HI> of
whom I had no Knowledge; but one, it &s;hould &s;eem, of more Beauty than
Delicacy; 
<Q> 
<L>Who took the Place of Ladies bright,</L> 
<L>And with their Lords lay all the Night!</L> 
<L>Who pleas'd them with her Humour free;</L> 
<L>Oh! the charming <HI>Sally Sal'sbu&mdash;ree!</HI></L> </Q></P>
<P>BUT I pa&s;s'd lightly over this Lyrick Frag|ment, as too ludicrous
for a Per&s;on of my Gra|vity, and fell, unexpectedly, upon a <HI>Work,</HI>
for &s;o I make no Scruple to call it, that de&s;erves to live for Ever! And

<P>I AM &s;orry I am not able to acquaint my Reader with <HI>his</HI>
Name, to whom we owe this melancholy Piece, of <HI>fini&s;h'd Poetry,</HI>
under the humble Title of a <HI>Ballad.</HI>&mdash;<HI>Such Ballads</HI> were
the reverend Fragments of disjointed <HI>Homer,</HI> when they were &s;ung
about the Streets of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Cities, before <HI>Lycurgus</HI>
cau&s;ed the Limbs to be a&s;&s;embled into Union; and &s;o piec'd, redeem'd,
and con&s;ecrated them to the End of Time, as we now &s;ee 'em in his <HI>Iliad.</HI>&mdash;Yet, the Common Fate of Merit is &s;o unequal to its
Claim, that one might almo&s;t venture to conclude, That this <HI>great
Genius,</HI> whoever he was, lived poor, and died unknown; in Want perhaps, of
Ea&s;e and Comfort, while he had Excellence, that merited a Nation's Gratitude,
for the Honour he might have lived to do it.</P>
<P>FROM an Air of impre&s;&s;ive Earne&s;tne&s;s, that is
di&s;tingui&s;hable through this Piece, I am of Opinion, that it was founded on
the real <PB N="303" REF="312"> Hi&s;tory of &s;ome unhappy Woman of the Age
the Author liv'd in, who had the Misfortune to die untimely by her Lover's
In&s;en&s;ibility; or, rather, by his Ingratitude.&mdash;I plea&s;e my|&s;elf
with an Imagination, that this <HI>Sonnet</HI> might be one of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s. A hundred wor&s;e are imputed to him: And there is his
peculiar, &s;olemn Power to touch this <HI>Church-Yard Ter|ror,</HI> very
vi&s;ible in the <HI>Gho&s;t</HI> of this Ballad.</P>
<P>BUT, whoever the Author was, his Judg|ment appears to have been as
extraordinary as his Genius; as is finely vi&s;ible in his Conduct of this
little Poem.&mdash;When the Gho&s;t has gli|ded in, and &s;tands at the Bed's
Foot of the &s;leep|ing Lover, had the Speech begun immediate|ly, the Reader
mu&s;t have been hurried too fa&s;t away from the Impre&s;&s;ion which the
Ap|parition was de&s;ign'd to make on him: He is, therefore judiciou&s;ly
detained in this Place by a De&s;cription of her Face and Po&s;ture, &s;o
&s;trongly painted, that we really &s;eem to <HI>&s;ee</HI> her. And, after a
&s;hort Moral Reflection, which follows aptly in the Third Stanza, we are
acquainted, during this artful Interval, with her Character, her Youth, her
Beauty, and the Cau&s;e of her unhappy Death: And, by that Time we are prepared
to know her, and to pity her, the Speech is open'd with this &s;harp and
&s;tartling Summons. 
<Q> 
<L>Awake! &s;he cry'd,&mdash;Thy true Love calls,</L> 
<L>Come from her Midnight Grave!</L> </Q></P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="313">BUT nothing was ever ju&s;ter, or more
&s;trikingly imagin'd, than his Compari&s;on of the Gho&s;t's Face, to an <HI>April</HI> Sky, (which is, at be&s;t, but faintly &s;hining, and is here
made fainter &s;till, by a &s;cattering Cloud that dims it) to the Shadow, as
it were, or thin Re&s;emblance of a Light not vi&s;ible. This is an Image, &s;o
true to the Meaning, &s;o Poetical, and well-adapted, that it greatly
de&s;erves Notice: As does al&s;o, That Clay-cold, Lilly-Hand, that holds up a <HI>&s;able Shroud</HI>! The Oppo&s;ition of the Shroud's Blackne&s;s, to the
Lilly White|ne&s;s of the Hand, is a delicate and graceful Stroke, and very
judiciou&s;ly heighten'd by that Epithet of <HI>Clay-cold,</HI> which makes us
&s;hrink, as if we <HI>felt,</HI> what we <HI>&s;ee,</HI> &s;o very <HI>&s;trongly.</HI></P>
<P>TO wake us from this Horror, in order to make way for that <HI>Pity,</HI> which he is prepar|ing to move in us, we are, by a &s;udden, yet
almo&s;t imperceptible, Tran&s;ition, carried away from what &s;he <HI>is,</HI>
to what &s;he <HI>was,</HI> before Love chang'd her; 
<Q> 
<L>Her <HI>Bloom</HI> was like the <HI>Morning Flow'r,</HI></L> 
<L>That <HI>&s;ips</HI> the <HI>Silver-Dew.</HI></L> </Q></P>
<P>I AM charm'd by a Stroke in this &s;weet <HI>Simile,</HI> which is
touch'd with &s;o much Delica|cy, that it would go near to e&s;cape the
Ob&s;er|vation of any Reader, not skill'd in Poetry: I will therefore take
Notice, That her exact Time of Life being directly pointed out by 
<PB N="305" REF="314"> <HI>The Morning Ro&s;e, ju&s;t opening to the View,</HI>
that Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Sipping the Silver-Dew,</HI> is peculiarly ju&s;t
and elegant: For, where a Flower is full blown, the Dew-drops have free
Admi&s;&s;ion, and are taken in, as it were, by large Draughts; but a budding
Flower, receiving no Moi&s;ture, but on its Edges, is, with the fine&s;t
Propriety, &s;aid to <HI>&s;ip</HI> it.</P>
<P>A SECOND excellent <HI>Simile</HI> is, That where he compares a
&s;ecret Love in a Woman's Heart, to the Canker-worm in a Bud, that fades and
de&s;troys it: And this, again, has the Air of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> who has
the &s;ame Al|lu&s;ion for <HI>Grief</HI> in one of his Tragedies.&mdash;There
is &s;omething exqui&s;itely <HI>touching</HI> in that noble Tenderne&s;s of
her Reproach, in the <HI>Eighth Stanza.</HI>&mdash;That <HI>Erotema,</HI> or
Figure of <HI>Que&s;tioning,</HI> which takes up the <HI>Ninth, Tenth,</HI> and <HI>Eleventh,</HI> is pur&s;ued with the mo&s;t pathetick Empha&s;is; and, at
la&s;t, broken off with an <HI>Apo&s;iope&s;is,</HI> &s;o natural, and &s;o
mov|ing, that I have &s;eldom &s;een a Beauty more di&s;tingui&s;hable. It is
where, after all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate <HI>Why's,</HI> with which &s;he has
been up|braiding her Lover's Fal&s;hood, &s;he interrupts them, on a &s;udden,
with this Self-accu&s;ing Que&s;tion, which &s;trikes out the <HI>Moral</HI>
too, in a &s;urprizing Fla&s;h of Warning, where it was lea&s;t to be expected;

<Q> 
<L>And <HI>why, alas!</HI> did I, fond Maid!</L> 
<L><HI>Believe</HI> the flatt'ring Tale?</L> </Q></P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="315">BUT it were endle&s;s to particularize the
Beauties of this charming Ballad. The whole may be &s;aid to be one continued
Beauty! And, I believe, it will not be po&s;&s;ible for any &s;erious Reader to
peru&s;e, or hear it, without Emotions in his Blood, that will &s;peak more in
its due Prai&s;e, than the mo&s;t regular <HI>Cri|tique</HI> on it.</P>
<P>IT is a plain and noble Ma&s;terpiece of the <HI>natural</HI> Way of
Writing, without Turns, Points, Conceits, Flights, Raptures, or Af|fectation of
what Kind &s;oever. It &s;hakes the Heart by the mere Effect of its own
Strength and Pa&s;&s;ionatene&s;s; una&s;&s;i&s;ted by tho&s;e flam|ing
Ornaments, which as often <HI>dazle,</HI> as <HI>di&s;|play,</HI> in Poetry.
This was owing to the Author's Native Force of Genius; For they, who conceive a
Thought di&s;tinctly, will, of Nece&s;&s;ity, expre&s;s it plainly, becau&s;e,
out of the Words which ari&s;e, and offer them&s;elves to embody a Meaning,
they find no U&s;e for the Superfluous, but to darken, and confound their
Purpo&s;e.</P>

Publi&s;hing his <HI>Edicts</HI> in a Language peculiar to the Throne, and
which, being unintelligible, by any of his <HI>Va&s;&s;als,</HI> can neither be
contradicted, nor di&s;puted again&s;t.</P>
<P>HE expatiated, la&s;t Night, with a Stile, unu&s;ually <HI>florid,</HI> on the <HI>Verbo&s;ity, Loquaciou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Propen&s;ion to Garrulity,</HI> of a worthy Common-Council-Man, whom we

&s;ome <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Manufactures, of <HI>Antient</HI> and <HI>reverend
Ety|mology.</HI> Modern Criticks, he &s;aid, were undetermin'd about them; but
for <HI>His</HI> Part, he had always maintain'd, That <HI>Chintz, Bullbull,
Morees,</HI> and <HI>Ponabaguzzys,</HI> were of nobler and more generous U&s;e,
than <HI>Doorguzees,</HI> or <HI>Nourfurmannys</HI>; not but he held again&s;t <HI>Byrampauts,</HI> in Favour of <HI>Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">|canees</HI> and <HI>Boralchauders</HI>; Only, he wi&s;h'd, That

<P>THERE was not One, of all the Com|pany, except the grave Banterer
him&s;elf, but laugh'd out aloud, at this humorous Retribution of the Scholar's
affected Lan|guage. He look'd a little out of Counte|nance, and &s;ate &s;ilent
for &s;ome Time. But he &s;tarted up, at la&s;t, with a &s;miling Air of good
Humour: And, filling out a Brim|mer, drank the Health of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Officer; and, then, &s;poke to him, as
fol|lows.&mdash;<HI>Sir, I find my&s;elf much obliged, and return you my
Publick Thanks. You have held to me &s;o true a Gla&s;s, that I &s;ee, and am

<P>THERE is a Hobby-Hor&s;e, in the World, call'd Nobility by Right of <HI>Birth</HI>; which was the Invention of indu&s;tri|ous Policy, to entail,
and perpetuate, Vir|tue. But, like Vinegar, from the fine&s;t Wines, it is &s;o
changed, by its Putrefaction, That there is not a &s;harper Cur&s;e, among the
Scourges of God's Vengeance, than is inflicted on Mankind, by that &s;illy
Thing, called, <PB N="318" REF="327"> <HI>Pride of De&s;cent.</HI> It was
fir&s;t indulged, as a Mark of Merit: But it clings, in&s;eparably, to the <HI>Line,</HI> after the mo&s;t manife&s;t Extincti|on of all the <HI>Worth,</HI> which it was given for.</P>
<P>YET, there was both the <HI>Rational,</HI> and the <HI>Generous,</HI>
in that Hope, which &s;eems to have been conceiv'd, by the fir&s;t Inventors of <HI>Nobility,</HI> from its Original In&s;titution.&mdash;Some Great, and
Powerful Prince, when he had experienc'd a Servant's Courage, his Con|duct, or
Integrity; and, was willing to tran|&s;mit tho&s;e Virtues (after they had been
&s;o u&s;eful to Him&s;elf) to the future Benefit of His Heirs and
Succe&s;&s;ors; made it his fir&s;t Care to be&s;tow, on this able Favourite,
&s;uch Lands, and Extent of Revenue, as might place him above the Nece&s;&s;ity
of concerning him&s;elf for his Childrens Support in Life. And this left him at
perfect Lei&s;ure, to en|large, and in&s;pire, their Minds, till He made them
capable of &s;ucceeding, as well to his Toils, and Dangers, as to his Honours,
and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>TO &s;trengthen, yet more, their Expecta|tion of &s;o good an End,
They contriv'd this further Means of adding vi&s;ible, and out|ward Marks;
betokening Honour, Power, and Wi&s;dom: Such as <HI>Titles, Robes, Rank,
Privileges,</HI> and a Train of Pomps, and Cere|monies. All The&s;e they made <HI>Hereditary,</HI> for this weighty, and &s;ufficient
Rea&s;on:&mdash;Becau&s;e, It was a natural Hope, that Per&s;ons, who were
exempt from private Wants, &s;hould, <PB N="319" REF="328"> al&s;o, be
un&s;ubject to private <HI>Ba&s;ene&s;s.</HI> They would, then, be at Liberty
to enlarge, and exalt, their Thoughts, in Proportion to that High Condition,
which they grew up in the Expectation, and Fore-knowledge of: 'Till they came
to di&s;dain narrow Principles, and renounce &s;elfi&s;h Purpo&s;es; &s;uch as <HI>Poverty</HI> might have &s;eemed to ju&s;tify; but, which could never
corre&s;pond with that Magnificence and di&s;intere&s;ted Scope of Mind, which
was propos'd to be the Con&s;equence of &s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd an Education,
in a Life &s;o happily provided for.</P>
<P>A NOBLEMAN, the De&s;cendant of No|ble Ance&s;tors, when we con&s;ider
him in this Light, &s;eems to be One of the Pillars of Hu|man Virtue, and the
honour'd Ornament of a Body Politick! And the only Rea&s;on, why we talk with
Re&s;pect, or even with Gravity, of the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of a Man's Family,
is, Be|cau&s;e, by how many more Succe&s;&s;ions the Line has continu'd <HI>Noble,</HI> by &s;o many more Examples their Virtues are &s;uppos'd to have
been fortified; 'till the Practice, and Love of <HI>Glory, Ju&s;tice,
Knowledge,</HI> and <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> are e&s;teem'd inherent, in their
very Nature; and their Blood flows down, di&s;tingui&s;h'd, by a kind of <HI>In&s;piration,</HI> which it carries with it.</P>
<P>BUT, exclu&s;ive of this &s;ingle Con&s;ideration what a ridiculous
Pretence to <HI>Reverence</HI> is the Accident of having been <HI>born, to live
lazily!</HI>&mdash;It is In&s;olence; in the highe&s;t Degree, for 
<PB N="320" REF="329"> a <HI>Cypher,</HI> of Rank, and Title, to expect
Sub|mi&s;&s;ion, from a Per&s;on, who is venerable, for his good Qualities,
upon no better a Foun|dation, than becau&s;e the <HI>accompli&s;h'd
Commo|ner</HI> is, perhaps, the Son of an hone&s;t Man, who had nothing to
depend on, but his In|du&s;try; And the <HI>fooli&s;h Lord</HI> had a Father,
who left him an E&s;tate, and a Title, which &s;omebody <HI>(a long Time
ago!)</HI> gave a &s;turdy, valiant, <HI>Soldier,</HI> to maintain his
Po&s;terity, till they &s;hou'd grow <HI>good for nothing,</HI> and look with
Scorn, at their fir&s;t Founder: Draw|ing all their empty Glory from the
number'd Ages, which have pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince <HI>Merit,</HI> and <HI>Humility,</HI> could claim a Place, in their <HI>Great Family!</HI></P>
<P>IF, in the World, there is a plea&s;anter Piece of &s;tupid
Impertinence, than ordinary, It is, that conceited and &s;atisfied, <HI>Self-Preference,</HI> with which one of the&s;e <HI>Happy</HI> Creatures
looks down, from his own Sublimity, upon the <HI>Merit</HI> that lies below
him!&mdash;But I wonder what he would An&s;wer, if, in the Heighth of his
Exultation, <HI>Fortune</HI> &s;hou'd take a Freak to whi&s;per this
Que&s;tion, in his Ear, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Pray, my Lord! have you con&s;ider'd, how to</HI>
De&s;erve <HI>this fine Di&s;tinction, which you in|herit, without knowing
why?&mdash;Are you Hone&s;ter, than your own Steward?</HI> Pretty much upon a <HI>Par.&mdash;Are you Braver, than your ragged Cou&s;in?</HI> Oh! no&mdash;Not
at all.&mdash;<HI>Are you more Pious, than your Chaplain?</HI> Far from it, I
a&s;&s;ure you.&mdash;<PB N="321" REF="330"> <HI>Are you Wi&s;er, or more
Learned, than my Lady, your Lord&s;hip's Wife?</HI> But a little, if any
thing.&mdash;<HI>Are you Richer, than your Banker?</HI> Not &s;o Rich, by half
a Plumb.&mdash;<HI>Pray, what then may your Lord&s;hip's Preten&s;ions be, to
that Re&s;pect, which you claim from others?</HI>&mdash;Why,&mdash;you know, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that I was <HI>born to it.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>IT is a plea&s;ant Preten&s;ion! let us trace it a little
higher.&mdash;Why is <HI>This Lord</HI>'s Family of more Dignity than <HI>That
Lord</HI>'s, &s;ince their E&s;tates, and Rank, are Equal? <HI>Oh! there is a
very good Rea&s;on for That: It is, becau&s;e His Race is mo&s;t
Ancient.</HI>&mdash;Pray, what do you mean by <HI>Ancient?</HI> Was not <HI>Adam</HI> their common Father? <HI>Yes: But This My-Lord has been longer in
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lands, than That My-Lord has.</HI>&mdash;So then, the
Ca&s;e, it &s;eems, &s;tands thus, <HI>Other Mens Acquirements mu&s;t give
Him</HI> DIGNITY, <HI>to whom Other Mens Merit has given</HI> DISTINCTION!</P>
<P>ANTIQUITY of Name, and Family, is one of the mo&s;t riduculous Things
in Nature, when it is made u&s;e of, as the <HI>Ground of Ho|nours:</HI> There
being nothing more certain, than that the Revolutions of Time and For|tune,
have us'd all Families alike. And, were it po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee, backward,
into the Ob&s;curity of pa&s;t Ages, we might pick out <HI>Beggars,</HI> from
our proude&s;t Lines; and point at <HI>Princes,</HI> in our humble&s;t. This
Nobility, that con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>Sound,</HI> is an empty, and chi|merical, 
<PB N="322" REF="331"> Grandeur: It is a mere <HI>King of Clubs,</HI> who, as
the Game happens to be, may run away from the <HI>Knave,</HI> and &s;ee the
&s;ingle <HI>Ace</HI> a nobler <HI>Card</HI> than <HI>His Maje&s;ty!</HI></P>
<P>I FANCY, that, if I were a <HI>Lord,</HI> the <HI>Tur|key</HI>-Cock,
with his &s;weeping Wing, erected Neck, and Peer-like Strut, within the Sphere
of his <HI>Barn-door Royalty,</HI> wou'd make me &s;ick of my boa&s;ted <HI>Quality,</HI> unle&s;s I had better Claim than my <HI>Pride,</HI> to the
Stateline&s;s I was di&s;tingui&s;h'd by.</P>
<P>THE true U&s;e of <HI>Titles,</HI> is, That they may &s;erve, as
&s;hining Lights, to lay open and il|lu&s;trate, the &s;pacious Chambers of a <HI>Mind well-furni&s;hed.</HI> But, to a clo&s;e, and &s;ordid, Soul, they are
like Torches, which we carry down, to illuminate a &s;ickly Dungeon: Where they
expo&s;e, but the more di&s;grace|fully, the narrow Cells, bare Walls; and
Dirtine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE ba&s;e&s;t Thing in Nature is, To have <HI>Power</HI> to do <HI>much</HI> Good, without <HI>Will</HI> to do <HI>any.</HI> How contemptible,
then, are they, who, becoming in&s;olent by Pro&s;perity, think on nothing &s;o
&s;eldom as the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Mi&s;erable? And, while they were made
No|ble, for this End only, to be active in good Offices, live, for <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> and to no better Purpo&s;e than one of their <HI>Hounds,</HI> or their <HI>&s;etting Dogs</HI>?&mdash;If a Nobleman, who is
thus declin'd, from the only End of his In&s;titution, can be Author of any
Good, by Effect of his <HI>Example,</HI> it mu&s;t be &s;uch an 
<PB N="323" REF="332"> accidental, and involuntary, Service, as was done, of
old, to the <HI>Philo&s;opher.</HI>&mdash;He was ask'd, From whom he learnt, to
be &s;o &s;teady, in Pur&s;uits of Virtue? 
<Q REND="inline">'I learn it, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> from the Per&s;ons
who live <HI>mo&s;t vici|ou&s;ly</HI>: For, ob&s;erving what makes them
de|&s;picable, I &s;ee plainly what to <HI>&s;hun</HI>: And I gue&s;s, by the <HI>Rever&s;e,</HI> what it is that I ought to <HI>practi&s;e.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Ea&s;tern People a&s;cribe to <HI>Plato</HI> &s;everal excellent
Sayings, which we do not find in his Works: And, among others, they cite this
following. 
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Plenty</HI> and <HI>Want,</HI> are Two <HI>Clouds,</HI> the fulle&s;t &s;tor'd of any; the Fir&s;t rains <HI>Dul|ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Arrogance</HI>; the Second, <HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Humility.</HI> For, while the <HI>Body</HI> of the Poor is improving into <HI>Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Rich is degenerating into <HI>Body.</HI>'</Q> It is a pretty Remark: And every Man's Experi|ence will
enable him to ju&s;tify it. For how few Publick or Private Improvements have
been owing to our Men of Rank? And how many to the un&s;atisfied Application of
the Unhappy; who, finding them&s;elves pre&s;s'd, by unea&s;y Circum&s;tances, <HI>whet</HI> and <HI>urge</HI> their active Talents, 'till Pro&s;perity can
afford them <HI>Lei&s;ure</HI> to be as u&s;ele&s;s, as if they were <HI>born
to it.</HI></P>
<P>IT is plain, then, That a <HI>Nobleman,</HI> who has no other Merit,
than his Rank gives him, has no Merit at all: And is ju&s;t &s;o much more
de&s;picable than a <HI>Commoner,</HI> who is equally worthle&s;s, as the
Duties of his Condition are <PB N="324" REF="333"> more elevated, and
important. And that <HI>Re&s;pect,</HI> which is look'd for, by a Lord, <HI>merely as a Lord,</HI> de&s;erves to be number'd among tho&s;e Sacrifices,
which we make to Cu&s;tom, at the Expence of our common Sen&s;e; and to the
Di&s;honour of our natural Liberty.</P>
<P>AN E&s;&s;ay Writer, of the la&s;t Age, who had learnt from tire&s;ome
Experience, That he had, irrecoverably, <HI>lo&s;t</HI> tho&s;e Years, which he
had &s;pent in attending the <HI>Great,</HI> (as they love to hear them&s;elves
call'd) quitted the Pur&s;uit with a manly Scorn: And having ob|&s;erv'd, for
his Reader's U&s;e, That the&s;e Men make no Friend&s;hips, but &s;uch as are
&s;ub&s;er|vient, either to their <HI>Intere&s;ts,</HI> or their <HI>Plea|&s;ures</HI>; he clo&s;es all, with this Remark&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">'I have &s;o hearty a Contempt for what is commonly
called <HI>Greatne&s;s,</HI> that if I did not meet with the Word <HI>Lord,</HI> in a Prayer I repeat daily, I &s;hould never name it, but with <HI>Dete&s;tation!</HI>'</Q> And, to allow this Au|thor but common Ju&s;tice,
no Man is &s;o fool|i&s;hly, a Tyrant over his own Heart, as he, that humbles
him&s;elf, to a <HI>Will,</HI> that is too proud to take Notice of it: And
waits on tho&s;e, from whom he can expect nothing, but what he mu&s;t dearly
pay for, in Guilt, Di&s;honour, or Mortification.</P>
<P>I am pleas'd with a frank Correction, of that peevi&s;h, and
humour&s;ome, Arrogance, &s;o in&s;eparable from the&s;e proud Mens Beha|viour,
as it was given, by a <HI>Syrian</HI> Doctor, <PB N="325" REF="334"> to one of
the <HI>Caliphs</HI> of <HI>Babylon.</HI> They were Angling, upon the River <HI>Tygris</HI>; and the <HI>Caliph,</HI> growing impatient, becau&s;e he had
catched nothing, ordered the Phy&s;ician out of his Sight, for he was &s;ure he
&s;hould have no Sport, in Company with one, who was &s;o <HI>unlucky.</HI>&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay, but methinks, reply'd the Doctor, you accu&s;e
me a little ra&s;hly: My Father was a Drawer of Water, and my Mother but a
Slave; yet I have been Chief Favourite of many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive <HI>Caliphs,</HI> and am Rich, and Fortunate, beyond my Wi&s;hes: How then can
&s;uch a Man, as I, de&s;erve to be call'd <HI>unlucky?</HI> But if you would
be inform'd, I can name a Per&s;on, who may, <HI>truly,</HI> be &s;til'd
unhappy.'</Q> The <HI>Caliph</HI> told him, he might explain him&s;elf. 
<Q REND="inline">'&mdash;It is, Sir, pur&s;ued the Phy&s;ician, a Lord,

<P>SINCE Honours were fir&s;t be&s;tow'd, as a Reward of Mens pa&s;t
Virtues, and for Ex|citement of their Future, it &s;eems the ju&s;te&s;t Thing
imaginable, That all <HI>Lords,</HI> who po&s;|&s;e&s;s them, fruitle&s;ly,
&s;hould <HI>forfeit</HI> them: And &s;tep down among the Herd, to hide the
Shame of tho&s;e Defects, which, by Rea&s;on of their too high Situation, blaze
out, like a Beacon, to the Di&s;turbance of a whole Coun|try. 
<PB N="326" REF="335"> As, (for the &s;ame Rea&s;on) where a Nobleman is truly
&s;uch, his Wi&s;dom, his Courage, and his Loyalty, &s;trike out their
Influence in larger Circles, than the Virtues of inferior Ranks can
po&s;&s;ibly be extended to.</P>
<P>FOR my Part, as it is my Purpo&s;e to &s;peak of every Thing like a <HI>Plain Dealer,</HI> I declare with the utmo&s;t Indifference, That, though
no Man more &s;incerely reverences what a Nobleman was meant to be, yet I can
have no Re&s;pect at all, for the <HI>Name,</HI> where the <HI>Thing</HI> is
wanting. On the contrary, it is my Opinion, That every Gentleman of Spi|rit
&s;hould de&s;pi&s;e, and mortify the Vanity of &s;uch a chimerical
Superiority, as would ad|vance it&s;elf, above <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial Honour,</HI>
by the empty Memory and <HI>Sound</HI> of it.</P>
<P>THE Breath of a Sovereign may have Power to <HI>create Titles</HI>;
But it can have none, to <HI>invert Qualities.</HI> Though the Ve&s;&s;el is in
the Potter's Hands, and the Man <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be cal|led Noble, <HI>whom the
King delighteth to Ho|nour,</HI> yet, he will never <HI>be &s;o,</HI> by his
Patent, if he was not before, &s;o, in his Nature.&mdash;But there is a Kind of
Man, who, will, al|ways, be found Noble, without Aid of Pomp, or Titles: And,
in what Place &s;oever you chance to meet him, you may know him by the
following Marks: He will be Humble in Greatne&s;s; and Immoveable, in
Adver&s;i|ty. He will be compa&s;&s;ionate, without Weakne&s;s; Brave, without
Arrogance; Con|&s;cious, without Pride; and Sincere, without

his Anger will have no Malice. He will Love, without Folly: and Di&s;ap|prove,
without Hatred. His Hope will be Strong, but Patient: his Fear Awake, but
Ea&s;y. He will be Active, without Hurry; and at Lei&s;ure, without Idlene&s;s:
And, at lea&s;t, if he be not Learned, he will be a Lo|ver of Learning.</P>

Method of our Ance&s;tors; who were &s;o ignorant, to in|&s;til <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> as a Virtue, into their Female Pupils. Now, you mu&s;t
know, Sir, this Place is filled, at pre&s;ent, with a polite Set of Ladies,
(Members of a Society, with &s;o hard a Name, that I am afraid I &s;hou'd
&s;pell it wrong, &s;o will omit it) that have Heroically re&s;olv'd to put all
Mode&s;t Virgins out of Countenance, by &s;taring unmerci|fully in their Faces.
This Behaviour adds &s;o many new Charms, and renders them &s;o agreeable to
all they conver&s;e with, that I would gladly a&s;&s;ume a little of this <HI>Modern</HI> Accompli&s;hment: But the Prejudice of early imbib'd
Principles, is &s;o &s;trong, that, in&s;tead of an&s;wering a SMART in his own
Way, I cannot forbear Blu&s;hing, both for <PB N="329" REF="338"> Him, and the
Ladies that are diverted with his <HI>prodigious Wit</HI>: So beg you will

prevail with the Ladies to <HI>confe&s;s</HI> their <HI>Sex,</HI> by a Grain or

<P>MOST of our Neighbours, know|ing that I have the Honour to be
related to you, have put me upon writing this Letter, to acquaint you, That
Ye&s;ter|day a &s;trange and &s;urprizing Creature was &s;een to pa&s;s through
our Town on Hor&s;e|back: It had the Face of a young Woman, &s;tuck full of
Patches; a Perriwig, which hung down to Its Wai&s;t; a Hat, cock'd with the
Smartne&s;s of a young Officer; a huge Bunch of Ribbons, fa&s;tened behind Its
Left-Shoulder; a Shirt laid in large <PB N="330" REF="339"> Pleights on the
Brea&s;t, and tied clo&s;e at the Neck and Wri&s;ts, which, with a Ve&s;t of
White Satten, trimm'd with Black, had much the Re&s;emblance of a Shroud. Our
whole Town was &s;oon alarmed with this &s;trange Appearance, and various are
&s;till the Opinions what It really was: The Old Peo|ple who were the mo&s;t
couragious generally, went pretty near to It, with their Specta|cles on, to
view It more di&s;tinctly; the younger Sort kept It at an awful Di&s;tance:
Some were of Opinion, that It was a High|wayman in Di&s;gui&s;e, and
accordingly were for &s;eizing It; others took It for a Nun; but by a certain
arch Lear It had with Its Eyes, I dare engage It had not a Bit of Nun's Fle&s;h
about It: However, by its pale Complexion, and Shroudlike Dre&s;s, mo&s;t of my
Neighbours, at la&s;t, concluded It to be a Gho&s;t, and &s;o took to their
Heels, and left me, (who am no great Believer in the&s;e Things) almo&s;t alone
with It in the Road. I had now an Opportunity. during the Time It was drinking
a Gla&s;s of <HI>Rhe|ni&s;h Wine</HI> and <HI>Sugar,</HI> at the <HI>Saracen's-head-Inn,</HI> to &s;urvey It well, and thereupon, con|cluding It
to be an <HI>Hermaphrodite,</HI> I enqui|red of the Man, who &s;eemed to have
the keeping of It, If he intended to &s;hew It in our Town? and at what Inn?
for, you mu&s;t know, Sir, that I have a mighty Cu|rio&s;ity to &s;ee one of
tho&s;e Creatures all over: But the Man, with an angry Coun|tenance, 
<PB N="331" REF="340"> told me, That what I took for an <HI>Hermaphrodite,</HI>
was only a young Lady, and that the Sort of Dre&s;s &s;he was in, was commonly
worn for a <HI>Riding-Habit</HI> by the Ladies of Fa&s;hion at <HI>London</HI>:
But as nei|ther I, nor my Neighbours, can believe it po&s;&s;ible for Folks,
upon no ill De&s;ign, to di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves in &s;uch a Manner, I
de&s;ire you will, in one of your PLAIN-DEALERS, (for we have it con&s;tantly

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE few Lines, I &s;ent to you, on the 27th of the la&s;t Month,
were in|tended for the Diver&s;ion of your Readers, and were the Dictates of a
Mind at Ea&s;e. I write to you now, with a quite different' 
<PB N="334" REF="343"> Spirit, and on a more &s;ub&s;tantial and &s;olid
Motive. My Heart was then, &s;o light, that I little thought it would, in &s;o
&s;hort a Time, grow &s;o heavy as I now find it. I am in Pain about a very
worthy Relation of ours, young Mr. <HI>Truelove,</HI> who, being ju&s;t
return'd from his Travels, is married to a young Lady, upon whom he had
&s;ecretly &s;et his Heart for &s;ome Years before he went Abroad. The
Perplexity of the Ca&s;e is, That he has married her, without the Knowledge of
his Father, and that the good old Gentleman, without the Know|ledge of his Son,
had provided for him a Lady, Beautiful like her, him&s;elf has cho|&s;en, and
young, like her; Equal in Fa|mily, but va&s;tly Superior in Point of For|tune.
Never was there a more Paternal Affection, than my Uncle <HI>Truelove</HI> has
&s;hewn innumerable Marks of to his Son; nor were there ever more Tokens of
Filial Piety, than my Cou&s;in has taken all Oc|ca&s;ions to demon&s;trate
towards his Father. It would be a wonderous Pity, that any Mi&s;under&s;tanding
&s;hould happen between &s;o loving and beloved a Father, and &s;o lov|ing and
beloved a Son: And yet we are all in mighty Apprehen&s;ions, that this
Marri|age may occa&s;ion a fatal Breach between them. The Father placed the
Pro&s;pect of the Son's Happine&s;s in his having a Wife with a plentiful
Fortune. The Son thought that, with Regard to his own Happine&s;s, 
<PB N="335" REF="344"> no Fortune could be put in Competition with the Value of
the Woman, who&s;e Virtue, Beauty, and Innocence, had en|dear'd her to his
Heart. The Father (if all our Family gue&s;&s;es right, and much I fear we do)
will be inraged at the Lo&s;s of an E&s;tate, in which he had imaginarily
pla|ced the whole Sum of his Son's Felicity in this World; he will tax him of
Impru|dence, tell him he has thrown him&s;elf away, and call this Marriage &s;o
enter'd upon with|out his Knowledge or Con&s;ent, an Act of Di&s;obedience. My
Cou&s;in, who bears a tender and an affectionate Heart, will ill brook the&s;e
Rebukes, that make his Fa|ther &s;eem to undervalue the precious Crea|ture,
whom he, above all the World, holds dear; he will not, he cannot, &s;uffer
them. He will ju&s;tify his Choice; He will be warm in the Defence of the Fair
One his Father has de&s;pi&s;ed; He will &s;peak with Indifference of the
Fortune; his Father had with Pains been &s;eeking, in Compari|&s;on of her, and
maintain the Privilege of his being of Age, and free to chu&s;e for him&s;elf.
Thus their very Affections, by this different Notion, they have of
Hap|pine&s;s, may be the Cau&s;es of their Diffe|rence; and &s;ince tho&s;e,
who have a Vio|lence in the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love, carry with them that Violence
into other Pa&s;&s;ions, we are apt to fear, that, unle&s;s &s;ome Precauti|ons
be taken, the Rupture may be dange|rous; <PB N="336" REF="345"> and we rather
think, by gentle Me|thods, to break the Force of the Di&s;ap|pointment in the
Manner of di&s;covering the Marriage to the Old Gentleman, than leave him to
the Chance of a ha&s;ty Fury, upon his &s;uddenly di&s;covering it him&s;elf.
We are all on the Son's Side, before the Matter breaks out; and we have a Mind
to make it up with the Old Gentleman, as it were without his own Knowledge. Our
Contrivance is, what I am &s;ure your Hu|manity will prompt you to help
forward; that you &s;hould pen a Paper, in Defence of the Right which young Men
have of chu&s;ing for them&s;elves, and again&s;t the Hard&s;hip there would be
in a Father's interpo&s;ing his Au|thority again&s;t the Inclinations of his
Son, in the Ca&s;e of Marriage, and after we have read that to him, we will
open it by De|grees. Though it is more particularly ours at pre&s;ent, yet it
is the World's Concern: The Young of both Sexes will be plea&s;ed with the
Speculation, and it may be very exten&s;ively beneficial. If that Fatherly
Gentleman, that wi&s;e Companion of yours, the Major, joins with you in
&s;upporting the Cau&s;e of the young People, two &s;uch Au|thorities will be
of great Weight with the old Ones, and, at lea&s;t reconcile them &s;o far to
this general Opinion of all Children, that when &s;uch Accidents happen, they
will not &s;tand in need of &s;o many Argu|ments to reconcile them to their
Per&s;ons. <PB N="337" REF="346"> In complying with this, you will give great
Ea&s;e and Satisfaction to our whole Family, and particularly to,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>WHEN this Letter came to my Hands, the Major happened to be pre&s;ent,
and as &s;oon as I had look'd it over, I told him, He had a Right to read it;
he did &s;o, and returning it with a Smile, <HI>Your Kin&s;woman</HI> (&s;aid
he) <HI>makes a very rea&s;onable Reque&s;t</HI>; The Old People, who are
generally in the Right, when they differ from the Young, will not be angry with
us, their Coaevals and Well-wi&s;hers, if we &s;hould endeavour to &s;hew, that
the young People are not al|together in the Wrong in this Point. <HI>For my
&s;hare, I mu&s;t frankly declare, That, when young People are at Years of
Di&s;cretion before they marry, the Law of Nature and Rea&s;on, &s;eems to
&s;peak them Free to chu&s;e for them&s;elves, &s;ince they, and not their
Parents, for no le&s;s a Term than Life, are to enjoy the</HI> Happine&s;s <HI>of a</HI> Right <HI>Choice, or feel the</HI> Smart <HI>of a</HI> Wrong <HI>one.</HI> The Major and I agreed in this Sentiment, and had a long
Di&s;cour&s;e upon <PB N="338" REF="347"> the Subject, which, when I got Home,
threw me into the following Reflections.</P>
<P>OF all the Affections, which move and act plea&s;urably upon the Frame
of Human Na|ture, <HI>Plato</HI> reckons Love the mo&s;t de&s;irable: <HI>For
He,</HI> &s;aith this curious Philo&s;opher, <HI>who is thoroughly affected
with this Pa&s;&s;ion, removes his Soul to the Place, where he has &s;ettled
his Affections, and lo&s;es Him&s;elf to find the Object he doats upon.</HI>
This plea&s;ant Straying, this delightful Wandering of the Soul from its own
Man&s;ion, is a beautiful De&s;cription of the Force of Love, and the Power,
which tho&s;e, who were created to charm, have to tran&s;port us, as it were,
from the Government of Our&s;elves, into their own ab&s;olute Dominion. A
Pa&s;&s;ion, which is, of its own Nature, &s;o violent, ren|ders Men
excu&s;able, in a great mea&s;ure, when they &s;eem to mi&s;place it: They
cannot be &s;aid to be guilty of a Fault in di&s;obeying their Relations, when
they are tran&s;ported beyond the Power of giving Law to them&s;elves. They are <HI>&s;unk in the &s;oft Captivity,</HI> and Cap|tives, are not free Agents:
Neither is it hard it &s;hould be &s;o in Nature; on the contrary, as good and
virtuous Women, alone, have the <HI>full</HI> Power of moving and captivating
the Soul in the manner I mention, it is &s;o far from being an Evil, that it is
a Ble&s;&s;ing to be highly coveted. The Man, who is born of a good Mother,
&s;ays little enough, when, tran&s;ported by her De&s;ert, he calls Women the
Ornaments of Mankind in their <PB N="339" REF="348"> Pro&s;perity, and their
Supports in Adver&s;ity; There is no being happy in Life without them.</P>
<P><HI>PLATO,</HI> in another Place, has carried the Sentiment to a more
agreeable Height, he &s;ays, <HI>The Soul of a Man, in Love, dieth in his own
Body, and liveth in anothers.</HI> This is Energy of Expre&s;&s;ion; and yet
there is not more of Strength and Delicacy, than of Pro|priety and
Ju&s;tne&s;s: For, the Soul of a Man in Love, is dead to all other Appetites.
The Man, who was in Love with Riches, and ea|ger in the Pur&s;uit of Honour,
before he be|held the Fair One, who captivated his Soul, the Moment his Heart
confe&s;&s;es it&s;elf a Victim to the Enchantment of Beauty, looks no longer
upon Honour and Riches as the Two principal Movements, they grow only
&s;econdary Ble&s;&s;|ings, and are no farther valued than as they may help him
to comfort, and adorn the adored Companion of his Life. Love is really, witn
regard to other Affections, what the Philo&s;o|pher's Stone is pretended to be,
with regard to Metals: It inriches, and ennobles every Thing it touches: It is
the genuine Elixir, that gives a golden Tincture to every Di&s;po|&s;ition of
the Mind; it heightens Ambition; it inlarges Genero&s;ity; it quickens Joy; it
bani&s;hes Envy; it extingui&s;hes Lu&s;t; it en|livens the Virtues, and
extirpates the Vices of Men in all Ranks and Conditions of Life. Is there a
King, who is a Lover of Money? The Beauty whom he langui&s;hes to make a 
<PB N="340" REF="349"> Queen, is valued beyond all his Trea&s;ure: Is there a
Courtier that is warm in the Pur&s;uit of a Coronet? Let him be in Love, and
his Mi&s;tre&s;s is his <HI>Pride</HI>: Without her, the Co|ronet will not
hinder his Head from aching: A <HI>Garter</HI> will le&s;s a&s;&s;uage the
Swellings of his proud Heart, than a <HI>Favour</HI> of her be|&s;towing. A Man
that has a Fulne&s;s of Joy in his Compo&s;ition, will grow melancholy, if he
lo&s;es the fair Object of his De&s;ires; Mu&s;ick cannot plea&s;e where her
Voice is not heard: Equipage, Embroideries, and Brocades are fal&s;e Colours
upon the Heart that is inwardly in Mourning. The Envious Man envies no Body but
his Rival, while he continues a Lover. The Lu&s;tful forgets his Appetites
after Va|riety of Women. What Parent can ratio|nally expect to be heard, when
he undertakes to plead again&s;t &s;uch powerful Impre&s;&s;ions? All the
Urgings of Duty will be of no Effect; all the Arguments that can be u&s;ed,
will be no Arguments to the&s;e; all the World, be&s;ide his Mi&s;tre&s;s, is
nothing to the Man that is in Love, and She is all the World to him.</P>
<P>WHAT can they hope to propo&s;e to a Son in this Condition, thar will
deter him from his Purpo&s;es? Will they propo&s;e to him a Women, whom they
think more beautiful and agreeable, and that as an infinite Superiority of
Fortune, above the Fair One, that is his own Choice; Let her be as great a
Fortune as &s;he plea&s;es, &s;he is no Fortune at all to him: She would be,
with all her Wealth, the Load <PB N="341" REF="350"> and Calamity of his Life. <HI>Love,</HI> he would &s;ay, <HI>is built upon the Union of Minds; Hearts are
not to be bribed by Gold, and true Pa&s;&s;ion is not to be bought off by the
Trea&s;ure of both</HI> Indies. He can have no Reli&s;h in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,
that his de&s;ired Partner &s;hares not. Will they add, That be&s;ides Fortune,
the Mi&s;tre&s;s they recommend, has infinitely more of Beauty in the World's
Eyes? He will an&s;wer, The World's Eye is none of his; he will grant, even
that &s;he may have Defects, and will not &s;top to &s;ay, <HI>That he is even
in Love with tho&s;e Defects.</HI> In fine, All they can propo&s;e will never
avail, nor is it, indeed, rea&s;onable that it &s;hould. If they threaten him
with their Di&s;plea&s;ure, and tax him with want of Duty, he will tell them,
That he is dutiful in all other Points; he will be &s;or|ry for their
Di&s;plea&s;ure, but cannot obey in this One Ca&s;e; he will make this
undeniable Quotation in his Defence, That <HI>he is to leave his Father and
Mother, and cleave to his Wife.</HI> And, truly, if his Parents think, that he
&s;ins again&s;t Prudence in chu&s;ing a &s;lender Fortune, all the World will
judge, that they would &s;in again&s;t Ju&s;tice, if, forcing his
In|clinations, they make him Wretched, under Pretence of making him Rich, and
render him Mi&s;erable, under the Colour of making him Fortunate.</P>

go between a Man and his Wife, on any Con&s;ideration whatever.</HI>&mdash;A
Friend of mine, who knew both the Man and the Wife, a&s;&s;ured me, That the
fir&s;t Grounds of their Difference were too ridicu|lous to bear being told;
but, that both being very &s;tiff and ob&s;tinate not to yield an Inch on
either Side, were, however, inwardly a&s;hamed, and wanted nothing more
earne&s;tly than a Pretence to come together by the In|terpo&s;ition of the

</LETTER>
<P>IF the Maxim of the above-mentioned Divine was to be followed in our
pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, <PB N="345" REF="354"> I do not know where this Complaint
might end, and whether it would not come to an open Rupture: It is certain, the
mo&s;t remarkable Divorces have ari&s;en from as &s;mall Beginnings. The very
Letter of this young Lady, &s;hews her to be a neat and cleanly Per&s;on, and
therefore her Complaint of this (I cannot help terming it) <HI>dirty</HI>
U&s;age, carries the greater Weight with it. I can, methinks, behold this young
Sloven approaching the tender Thing, and embracing her in a man|ner that turns
Plea&s;ure into a Torment; I &s;ee him hold her &s;truggling again&s;t a
Ki&s;s, his Arms round her unwilling Neck, force her Face to his dreaded Lip;
he is put to the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>ravi&s;hing</HI> a Ki&s;s from his own
Wife, and yet is ignorant of the Meaning.&mdash;He takes it, however, by
Violence.&mdash;She looks half plea&s;ed, half angry, hangs down her Head,
hides the Water in her Eyes, pu&s;hes him, between Je&s;t and Earne&s;t, from
her Bo&s;om; rubs her glowing and &s;marting Mouth, calls him <HI>Rough
Thing!</HI> with half a tender-laughing, and a half-whining Voice.&mdash;The
unpoli&s;h'd Creature ca&s;ts a Booby Stare at her, and is &s;tupidly at a
Lo&s;s to know why &s;he &s;truggles &s;o hard again&s;t what &s;he likes:
Unle&s;s he is told, point-blank, That his Beard is the Cau&s;e of all the
Di&s;or|der, he cannot perceive that her Cheeks look red and angry with his
Ki&s;&s;es, and wear ra|ther the Print of Fury than Love. He mu&s;t be told,
That a delicate Skin was never <PB N="346" REF="355"> form'd to be bru&s;h'd
over by a bri&s;tly Beard, that is rough, and &s;tubborn, like the Hu|mour that
lets it grow. I call it more parti|cularly <HI>&s;tubborn</HI> in this
unaccountable young Fellow, for &s;he has told, and told him of it again and
again, in plain Terms, and he, notwith&s;tanding all this, pertinaciou&s;ly
conti|nues to go <HI>rough.</HI> Now is it not a prepo&s;te|rous way of acting,
after all, that when a <HI>Lover,</HI> he &s;hould &s;have clo&s;e, for fear of
of|fending the Eye of a Mi&s;tre&s;s whom he was uncertain of obtaining; and
yet let it grow, when a <HI>Husband,</HI> without having the Fear of wounded
Beauty before his Eyes; and without any Apprehen&s;ions of hurting that Face by
his Roughne&s;s, that charm'd him by its Softne&s;s.</P>
<P>I DWELL the more upon this Subject, as in|con&s;iderable as it may
&s;eem to &s;ome, becau&s;e it is a Male Vice that I have frequently ta|ken
Notice of, and as often wi&s;h'd to &s;ee re|medied for the &s;ake of the fair
Sufferers, who are wedded to &s;uch unpoli&s;h'd Barbarians. A Marriage
Conver&s;ation ought to humanize and temper Men; on the contrary, the&s;e,
in|&s;tead of growing tamer, are made more &s;a|vage by Matrimony.</P>
<P>YOU &s;hall &s;ee a Lover in a fine Campaign Peruque, and an
embroider'd Suit of Cloaths, alter'd into a Husband, with an aukward Country
Bob, and a Surtout made out of a Rug. You &s;hall find his Manners following
his Dre&s;s, and his Complai&s;ance degenerating <PB N="347" REF="356"> into
Bluntne&s;s. It is in all Degrees alike. You &s;hall &s;ee one, whom before
Marriage, you would take for a Lord, alter'd, after it, into a Coachman; many
that &s;eemed Senators tran&s;muted into Jockies; a hundred ceremo|nious Beaus
turn'd Clowns, and numberle&s;s Sir <HI>Clements</HI> transformed into Country <HI>Lob|bins.</HI></P>
<P>SURE, as old as I am, I have a more amorous Nature in me &s;till, than
the&s;e my|&s;terious young Fellows, who&s;e Affections and Actions are &s;o
different, I cannot tell what to make of them. I can ea&s;ily gue&s;s it would
tickle my Ear &s;trangely, to hear a young beautiful Creature telling me, how I
&s;hould become more agreeable to her, by adorning my&s;elf, and intreating me
to do it. For Ex|ample, if <HI>Patty Amble</HI> and I were upon ab|&s;olute
Terms of Agreement, There are not any little Cu&s;toms, that I would not depart
from for her Ea&s;e. As fix'd an Aver&s;ion as I have profe&s;s'd again&s;t
clouded Canes, I &s;hould, however, be ea&s;ily per&s;waded to carry a painted
Stick, in&s;tead of an Oaken, if by <HI>walking</HI> with it, I was &s;ure to
make <HI>Progre&s;|&s;ion</HI> in my Wife's Affection; nay, I would admit a <HI>Knot of Ribbons</HI> to it into the Bar|gain, provided it would render our <HI>Marriage-Knot</HI> the ea&s;ier. Again, I have known Wo|men, who have a
prodigious Aver&s;ion to a <HI>Mou&s;e,</HI> and are not only very wary at
guard|ing their Petticoats upon the Approach of that little noxious and nimble
Animal, but <PB N="348" REF="357"> do not even care that any Thing, which looks
the lea&s;t like it, &s;hould come near them: Now, if my <HI>Patty</HI> was of
that Temper, I, who know how far Women are apt to &s;tretch &s;ome Antipathies,
would alter the very Colour of my Gloves for fear of Offence; and though I have
affected <HI>Mou&s;e-colour</HI> for &s;o many Years, I would fit my&s;elf with
a Pair of White, or, at lea&s;t, of a le&s;s frightful Complexion, before I
would come within Arm's Length of her Hoop. In fine, tho' I wear a little <HI>Mu&s;tache</HI> (the Fa&s;hion when I was young, and a Peculiarity I have
not mentioned of my&s;elf 'till this Day) that would rather tickle than offend,
yet &s;ooner than that &s;hould interpo&s;e, it &s;hould be de|voted to the
Edge of the Razor. For I am ab&s;olutely for re&s;cinding the lea&s;t
Ob&s;tacles between a Man and his Wife, before Mat|ters are carried too
far.</P>
<P>A GREAT many People will object, that the&s;e are Trifles; but I
&s;ay, They are Mat|ters that have more Con&s;equences than they dream of.
However, granting the Objection true, if conforming one's-&s;elf in little
Mat|ters is &s;ufficient to plea&s;e, it is the lea&s;t a Man can do, to
indulge &s;o amiable a Crea|ture.</P>
<P>COMPLIANCE in Dre&s;s, is a Piece of Matrimonial Wi&s;dom, <HI>Fine
Feathers making fine Birds:</HI> Women often chu&s;e more judici|ou&s;ly than
the Men; and have Regard to <PB N="349" REF="358"> Sen&s;e, Temper, and
Behaviour, but they will have a Mixture of Appearance too, in the Compo&s;ition
of their Man, if po&s;&s;ible; and Dre&s;s pa&s;&s;es, with &s;ome of them,
even beyond Looks; in&s;omuch, that though Fi|nery, in the general Rule, be the
Glory and darling Pa&s;&s;ion of a Woman, yet there are Exceptions of many, who
would rather &s;ee their Husbands fine, than them&s;elves. No|thing is more
common, than to hear <HI>ordinary</HI> Women, e&s;pecially, who, after they are
mar|ried, are very free in declaring the Source of their Affections, &s;ay,
That the Neatne&s;s of her Husband, the Smugne&s;s of his Look, and the
Cleverne&s;s of his Shape, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> fir&s;t made her in Love with him.
If this be the Ca&s;e, when the Cau&s;e cea&s;es, the Effect will cea&s;e too:
The Moment he grows dirty, wears a long Beard, or drowns him&s;elf in a large <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> the plea&s;ant Picture, that his Wife had painted of him,
in her Fancy, va|ni&s;hes; and if not re-imprinted &s;ometimes, her Liking
in&s;en&s;ibly wears away. In fine, as much Trifles as the&s;e are, a Wife's
Heart, if <HI>that</HI> be a Trifle, is lo&s;t by the Di&s;u&s;e of them; and
perhaps made a <HI>trifling</HI> Pre&s;ent of, to a Stranger that minds
Dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>I HAVE been credibly informed, That it is a political Piece of
Cunning, among tho&s;e unlucky Sparks, who affect to &s;hine by the Means of
modi&s;h Wickedne&s;s, to ob&s;erve, how the Husband, who grows carele&s;s
after Marriage, appeared in the Times of his <PB N="350" REF="359">
Court&s;hip, and to equip them&s;elves accord|ingly. They Play the Part of the <HI>Suiter</HI> &s;o well upon the <HI>Husband,</HI> as to e&s;trange from him
the Affections of his Spou&s;e, and transfer them to their proper Purpo&s;e.
They dre&s;s in the &s;ame Manner, wear Cloaths of the &s;ame Colour, are
punctual in his very Pinch and Cock of the Hat, mimick his Air, Gait, Mien, and
by this Policy in Love, make the Husband his own Rival. But as the Face is the
Mart of Love, &s;o the&s;e Inconveniencies happen mo&s;tly from an Over-neglect
of that Part; the being not &s;haved ruffles a Wo|man's Temper again&s;t her
Husband; while the Gallant, by being trimm'd, &s;mooths a Pa&s;&s;age to her
Inclination.</P>
<P>I AM &s;ure, if the Ca&s;e &s;tands thus, a Bar|ber is an Arti&s;an of
Importance, &s;ince, be|&s;ides taking off the <HI>Beard,</HI> he lops away
&s;uch growing Evils.</P>
<P>LET Him, therefore, that values his Head, look to his Beard; and be
mindful.</P>

<P>EVER &s;ince I was a School-Boy, I have been fond of walking in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey,</HI> where, when my Heart is heated, by the Violence
of &s;ome unruly Pa&s;&s;ion, I enjoy a cool Compo&s;ure, and a kind of
Venerable Refre&s;hment.&mdash;Its dusky Cloi&s;ters, maje&s;t|ick I&s;les,
Quire, Organs, Royal Tombs, and reverend Variety of &s;trong, impre&s;&s;ive,
Images, have a never-failing Power to <HI>reduce</HI> my Mind from Tran&s;port,
when Hope, Pro&s;perity, or Plea&s;ure, have betray'd it into Vanity; or, to <HI>relieve</HI> it, when di&s;order'd, by a Weight of Angui&s;h, or
Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>DEATH, and the Sun,</HI> &s;ays a <HI>French</HI> Writer, <HI>are
Two Things not to be look'd upon with a &s;teady Eye.</HI>&mdash;Though there
is &s;omething in his Ob&s;ervation, rather pretty, than ju&s;t, yet &s;o far
is certainly true, That we are un|qualify'd <PB N="352" REF="361"> to think,
&s;erenely, on our <HI>Di&s;&s;olu|tion,</HI> while we are &s;urrounded by the
Noi&s;e, and Hurry of the World, in its ambitious Scenes; or &s;often'd into
&s;en&s;ual Wi&s;hes, by the Languor of an idle Solitude.&mdash;While <HI>we</HI> are Part of our own Pro&s;pect we can never view it ju&s;tly: But,
in &s;uch a Situation as the <HI>Abbey,</HI> we are plac'd as it were, out of
our|&s;elves, and, from this ancient <HI>Stand</HI> of Death, look back upon a
Country, which we &s;eem no longer to have any Concern in; and which, therefore
we can judge of with the nece&s;&s;ary Clearne&s;s and Impartiality.</P>
<P>THE Mind that is &s;tedfa&s;t enough to medi|tate, calmly, on Death,
will be arm'd to re|&s;i&s;t the Strength, and the Flattery, of human
Pa&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Such Thoughts, if they make us not <HI>better,</HI> will,
at lea&s;t, make us <HI>wi&s;er</HI>; &s;ince that mu&s;t moderate our
Wi&s;hes. which puts us out of Countenance at their Levity: And, who can
reflect, without being a&s;ham'd, that while every Thing, in <HI>Life,</HI> is
accidental, and <HI>Death,</HI> the only Certainty; we go on to act
notwith&s;tanding, as if all Things, el&s;e were <HI>in|fallible,</HI> and
Death but <HI>accidental.</HI></P>
<P>I, &s;ometimes, &s;uffer my&s;elf to be &s;hut up for Five or Six
Hours among the <HI>Tombs,</HI> where I &s;it down without Ceremony, or
Reprehen|&s;ion, among the proude&s;t of tho&s;e Princes, who were once, too
&s;tately to be convers'd with, but at Di&s;tance, and with Fear and
Re|verence.&mdash;I po&s;&s;e&s;s, in common, with the Spiders (their
Companions, and mo&s;t con|&s;tant <PB N="353" REF="362"> Servants, who
&s;pread Net-work over their Trophies) the unenvied Privilege of &s;ur|rounding
tho&s;e la&s;t Beds of forgotten Ma|je&s;ty.&mdash;Here I bury my&s;elf, in
&s;olemn Si|lence, and imprint my Imagination with Images, which awaken Thought
and prepare me for Humility.&mdash;The &s;tain'd, and melancholy Light, that
enters faintly through the painted Windows, as if it wore a decent <HI>Mourning,</HI> to become the Scene it opens to me, guides me, &s;lowly, by
the cloi&s;ter'd Allies, du&s;ty Tombs, and weeping Statues, till I am lo&s;t
in that &s;till Pomp of figur'd Sorrow, which, on every Side, inclo&s;es
me.</P>
<Q> 
<L>From fini&s;h'd Pray'r, the Flock di&s;per&s;e apace,</L> 
<L>And each glad Foot for&s;akes the dreary Place:</L> 
<L>The hooded <HI>Prebend,</HI> plods along before;</L> 
<L>And the la&s;t <HI>Virger,</HI> claps the ringing Door.</L> 
<L>Then, thoughtful, ling'ring, curious, and alone,</L> 
<L>In the dark Temple, when the re&s;t are gone,</L> 
<L>No Noi&s;e invades my Ear; No murm'ring Breath</L> 
<L>Not one low <HI>Whi&s;per,</HI> in the <HI>Hall</HI> of <HI>Death!</HI></L> 
<L>No trampling Sound &s;wims o'er the &s;ilent Floor;</L> 
<L>But the &s;low <HI>Clock,</HI> that counts the &s;liding Hour!</L></Q>
<P>HERE, indulging Contemplation, I forget my Cares, and Misfortunes, and
di&s;encumber my&s;elf from the Forms, and Embarra&s;&s;ments of Conver&s;e. I
become the Inhabitant of a quiet, and unbu&s;y World, where all is &s;erene and
peaceful: I am di&s;turb'd by no Fears, inflam'd by no Anger, in&s;pir'd by no
Hope, tormented by no Jealou&s;y: I can expect, <PB N="354" REF="363"> whitout
Impatience; and be di&s;appointed, without Affliction: The Du&s;t, which is
&s;cat|ter'd round me, and which once, was Living Fle&s;h, as I am, choaks the
Fountains of my Pride, and produces in me a Mortification, that is too &s;trong
for all my Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I WAS pre&s;ent, very lately, when of tho&s;e Monumental Hi&s;torians,
who&s;e Imployment it is to draw a Profit from reading Lectures, on the&s;e
Re&s;ting Places of our antient Princes, was &s;hewing the Tomb of <HI>Henry
the Fifth,</HI> to a Circle of Holiday Strollers.&mdash;After having inform'd
the ta&s;tele&s;s Wonderers, That this was <HI>He</HI> who <HI>conquer'd</HI>
France! That His <HI>Son</HI> was <HI>crown'd</HI> in <HI>Paris</HI>! That he
married <HI>the French King's Daughter</HI>! And what el&s;e he had been Able
to collect from the Records of this great Prince's Reign; he pointed to a
Plain, Wooden, Worm-eaten, Coffin, that was plac'd upon the Ground, by this
Tomb's Side, and told them, That it contain'd the Body of Queen <HI>Catherine,</HI> the beautiful Wife of this Triumphant <HI>Henry.</HI>&mdash;Adding, That for a &s;mall, additional, Contribution, he
would unlock the Coffin, and let them look in upon her Corp&s;e, which lay
there, perfect, and undecay'd, though &s;he had been dead al|mo&s;t Three
hundred Years. They had Curi|o&s;ity enough to pay the Price demanded, and the
Propo&s;er made good his Promi&s;e, unveiling to their Sight, and Touch, the
Reliques of that Royal Charmer.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="364">I CANNOT expre&s;s the Indignation, and Con|cern
which this Scene gave me.&mdash;Her lovely Limbs, which, once, were thought too
ten|der for the Wind to blow upon; and which were never &s;een without Joy,
Reverence, and Wonder, by the Conqueror of Her Father's Kingdom, and the
Sovereign of This in which &s;he died: <HI>Now,</HI> lay neglected, and
expos'd! denied even Earth to cover her! and made a Spectacle, for
Entertainment of a Croud of common Wanderers!</P>
<P>SUPERIOR, as this Lady was, in her Beauty Birth, and Fortune, what
Prae-eminence in Death have all the&s;e given her above the <HI>Meane&s;t,</HI>
and mo&s;t <HI>Unlovely?</HI>&mdash;After hav|ing made her <HI>Life</HI> a
changeful Cour&s;e of Sor|row and Calamity, they left her de&s;titute, in <HI>Death,</HI> without the Decency of a <HI>Grave</HI> to <HI>&s;helter</HI>
her!&mdash;There, now, &s;he lies, a Proof of tran&s;itory Greatne&s;s! To
comfort the <HI>Wretched,</HI> with this Reflection, when they look in upon her
expos'd Remains, that <HI>Nature</HI> has made no Difference between a <HI>Royal,</HI> and a <HI>Vulgar,</HI> Body; But, that, taking away what was
added by <HI>Fortune,</HI> each, from the Moment of Death, is the other's Equal
to Eternity.</P>
<P>WHAT Rank, or Condition, is there among us, which may not draw, from
this great School of Moral Rea&s;oning, &s;ome Ob&s;erva|tion for their
Benefit?&mdash;Even the <HI>Unwary</HI> and <HI>Extravagant,</HI> who&s;e Lives
are a con|tinued Luxury! and to whom the Mi&s;eries <PB N="356" REF="365"> of <HI>Debt</HI> appear remote, and without Terror! Even <HI>They,</HI> may find a
Le&s;&s;on among the&s;e <HI>Tombs</HI>; for there they may be &s;hewn the
Bodies of great Men, doing Penance in their Velvet Coffins, and <HI>impri&s;on'd after Death,</HI> to &s;atisfy the Malice of their &s;tubborn
Creditors, as if the Influence of &s;ordid Money could extend its Cruelties
beyond Life, and had a Privilege to di&s;turb, by Avarice, the &s;leeping
A&s;hes of de|parted Sovereigns!</P>
<P>IS a Man in&s;ulted? wrong'd? betray'd? Does he hate his
di&s;tru&s;ted Enemy? Are his Thoughts imploy'd on Revenge? And does he break
his Sleep with Stratagems, to avoid, or retaliate, the Inju&s;tice that may be
done him? Let him walk with me in this in&s;truct|ive Circle, and I will &s;hew
him the Du&s;t of a murder'd Monarch, mixing quietly with <HI>his</HI> who
murder'd him.&mdash;I will tread with him over Earth that is pa&s;&s;ive, and
ferments not, though compos'd of united Atoms from the mingl'd Bodies of
tho&s;e Men, who&s;e bat|tling Intere&s;ts and Affections, while they <HI>liv'd,</HI> &s;hook the Kingdom like an Earthquake!&mdash;When the <HI>Quarrel&s;ome</HI> con&s;ider <HI>This</HI> they ought to blu&s;h at their
little Hatreds, and grow a&s;ham'd to let their Souls be divided by
Animo&s;ity, when Death may crumple their Bodies together, and incorporate them
with their mo&s;t malicious Enemy!</P>
<P>THERE is no Fortune &s;o <HI>exalted,</HI> but it may find a <HI>Check</HI> in this dark Man&s;ion: Nor any Condition &s;o <HI>dejected,</HI> but that it may <PB N="357" REF="366"> be &s;ure of a <HI>Comfort</HI>: Every Stone that we look upon, in this Repo&s;itory of pa&s;t
Ages, is an <HI>Entertainment,</HI> and a <HI>Monitor.</HI>&mdash;I never leave
its venerable Gloom, without finding my Mind cooler, and more compos'd than
when I enter'd.&mdash;I &s;ink deep into my&s;elf, and &s;ee my Heart without
Di&s;gui&s;e; in its good, or evil Propen&s;ities: And I ga|ther Power from
the&s;e &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ions to re|&s;i&s;t Plea&s;ure, Pride, Ambition, or
low Avarice: And to fortify the Impul&s;es of Humility, For|givene&s;s,
Charity, and the Virtues of Con|tent and Quietude.</P>
<P>THERE was publi&s;h'd, a few Years &s;ince, a Poem, call'd
WESTMINSTER-ABBEY. I am &s;orry the Author's Name was not printed with it.
There is &s;omthing highly elevated in his Genius, that is &s;weetly &s;erious,
and &s;ublimely melancholy!&mdash;The Ver&s;es in&s;ert|ed above, I am indebted
for to that Poem: And I &s;hall borrow from the &s;ame Piece, the&s;e
following, which, I will take the Liberty to affirm, are as fine ones, as were
ever written.&mdash;I ask Pardon for a Tran&s;po&s;ition, and Alteration, or
Two, which I have only made, that I might have the Plea&s;ure of collecting
into one view, as many of the Beauties, as could po&s;&s;ibly be drawn together

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Mr. PLAIN DEALER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am an old Man, as you are, and when I reflect on the fanta&s;tick
Vici&s;&s;itude of human Affairs; when I con&s;ider the Short|ne&s;s of Life,
and the &s;mall Preten&s;ions I have to any longer Share in it, it fills my
Mind with &s;omething grave, &s;olemn, and, I mu&s;t own, melancholy; but when
I give my Thoughts a more unbounded Scope, and pa&s;s over that &s;hort
Intermi&s;&s;ion of Life, into the Contemplation of an Eternal 
<PB N="361" REF="370"> Being, my Mind recovers from that Gloom, which the
fir&s;t Reflection fill'd me with, and grows gay, in Proportion to the
Influ|ence which this latter has upon it.</P>
<P>I WAS, la&s;t Night, reading that celebrated Speech of <HI>Cato</HI>
whence I have taken the Motto, with which I head this Letter, and whether it
was from the &s;erious Thoughts which that Soliloquy in&s;pired, or the la&s;t
&s;trong Glimp&s;es of a Mind almo&s;t expiring, and habituated to &s;uch
Speculations, I am not able to determine; but I was no &s;ooner fallen
a&s;leep, than the following Dream, or rather <HI>Vi&s;ion,</HI> grew into
Form, and fill'd my Fancy.</P>
<Q> 
<P>METHOUGHT the dreadful Hour was come, in which I was to re&s;ign
this Life; my Bed was &s;urrounded by a &s;ilent Company of weeping Friends,
who&s;e Sorrows touch'd me more, than my own approaching Di&s;&s;olution, which
happen'd in le&s;s Time, than human Nature can con|ceive, and therefore (though
at that Period I felt it &s;en&s;ibly) it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould now
de&s;cribe it. I was no &s;ooner freed from the Incumbrance, and Ob&s;curity,
of <HI>Mat|ter,</HI> but my Soul became refined to &s;uch an infinite Degree of
Conception, that my Eyes, having nothing to interrupt, or con|fine their View,
were &s;trengthen'd with &s;uch piercing Beams, that they darted every Glance
through an innumerable Pro|gre&s;&s;ion <PB N="362" REF="371"> of Worlds, and
illuminated me with a particular, and perfect, Knowledge of the Harmony, and
Fabrick of each ex|tended Sy&s;tem.</P> 
<P>WHILST I was thus lo&s;t in Contem|plation (for infinite Spare, like
an endle&s;s Source, &s;till afforded me new Objects to nouri&s;h that
inextingui&s;hable Thir&s;t of Knowledge, which is the Employment of Eternal
Life) I felt a Heavenly Tran&s;port, which diffus'd it&s;elf, &s;wifter than
Thought, through the Frame of my new Being; and which, at the &s;ame Time it
made my Soul tremble with its Influence, invigora|ted, and enabled it to
&s;upport the Energy.</P> 
<P>I NOW enjoy'd perfect Felicity, and whil&s;t my Soul (who&s;e
De&s;ire of Know|ledge increa&s;ed in proportion with its Power to gratify it)
imploy'd each different Sen|&s;ation in pur&s;uit of that Branch, which which
was peculiar to its Nature; on a &s;ud|den, I heard an univer&s;al Crack, which
&s;eem'd to ari&s;e from the whole Number of created Worlds, and re&s;ounded
from Globe to Globe, with a long Continuance of rever|berated Uproars.</P> 
<P>AT la&s;t, the Chain that link'd them in that dependant Order, in
which, from the fir&s;t Moment of their Creation, they have perpetually been
moving, &s;hiver'd, of it|&s;elf: The loo&s;en'd Orbs, thus di&s;united, began
to roll, with an unconceivable Swift|ne&s;s, through the va&s;t Expan&s;e of
Space, <PB N="363" REF="372"> and met, and &s;hock'd each other in the dark
Vacuity! The <HI>Sun,</HI> now robb'd of Light, whirl'd rapid, and irregular!
The <HI>Moon</HI> let loo&s;e her Seas, and rain'd a De|luge in her falling!
The <HI>fixed Stars,</HI> that, from the Birth of Time, had kept their
appointed Stations, no longer aw'd by the all-powerful <HI>Word,</HI> broke
loo&s;e, and ru&s;h'd together. Prodigious was the Sound! and horrible the
Conflict! The Elements, for|getting their re&s;pective Qualities, and urg'd by
the immutable Decree, met, all, and <HI>mix'd,</HI> and lo&s;t them&s;elves, in
ruinous Confu&s;ion.</P> 
<P>WHEN all &s;eem'd bury'd in profounde&s;t Darkne&s;s, the wild
Uproar ceas'd at once; and as I wonder'd at this &s;udden Silence, a Pyramid of
Fire broke thro', that in a Moment, enwrapp'd the Whole, and, having nothing
left to prey upon, at length, devour'd it &s;elf.</P> 
<P>THUS was the <HI>End</HI> of <HI>All!</HI> When from that
inacce&s;&s;ible Brightne&s;s, where the Di|vine Pre&s;ence conceals, yet makes
it &s;elf known, a Beam of Day &s;hot out, which lighting up the infinite
Extent of Heaven, and rendering it tran&s;parent, di&s;cover'd all its Glories.
I there perceiv'd the Stream of Life, which running through the mid&s;t of
Heaven, <HI>quicken'd</HI> where-ever it roll'd, and watering the Tree of
Knowledge, nou|ri&s;h'd it eternally: Next, I &s;aw numberle&s;s Swarms of
Beings, like my&s;elf, that fill'd <PB N="364" REF="373"> the Va&s;tne&s;s of
Infinitude, and &s;eem'd lo&s;t, like me, in Wonder, Prai&s;e, and Adora|tion.
I heard a Voice (which had more Influence, than the mo&s;t perfect Harmony of
human Art, and communicated it&s;elf to all alike) cry, <HI>Come, Eat of the
Tree of Knowledge, and Drink of the Water of Life.</HI></P> 
<P>IMMEDIATELY the Angelick Ho&s;t, and all the Children of Earth (who,
by Obedience to this Command, were become one, and the &s;ame) eat, and drank,
as they were commanded. The fir&s;t Effect of this, that I found on my&s;elf,
and per|ceived in all the re&s;t, was a perfect Recol|lection of whatever I had
done &s;ince my fir&s;t entering into Life: Various were the Con&s;equences!
The <HI>Ungrateful,</HI> the <HI>Mur|therer,</HI> the <HI>Mi&s;er,</HI> the <HI>Fal&s;e Friend,</HI> and the <HI>Rebel,</HI> remember'd, with Horror, their
pa&s;t Crimes, and grew frantick, at every Thought, with the
Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of what they had merited. They felt the &s;e|vere&s;t Pangs
of that mo&s;t lively of all Torments, <HI>De&s;pair</HI>; but the <HI>Ju&s;t,</HI> and tho&s;e who had the lea&s;t to reproach them|&s;elves
with, found, yet, they had too much to an&s;wer for, when, in the Book of
Record, which was thrown open to the View of all, they perceived, that the
mi|nute&s;t of their Thoughts were regi&s;tered.</P> 
<P>NOW we all became &s;en&s;ible, how ea&s;y the Rule was by which we
were to have <PB N="365" REF="374"> liv'd; and how adapted to the required
Obedience of human Nature! Whil&s;t we were thus lamenting our unhappy States,
and aggravating our Mi&s;ery by Self-Con|viction, in an In&s;tant, we
di&s;cover'd a fiercer Blaze of Light, and beheld the my|&s;tick Veil drawn
off, that &s;hrouded the Almighty's Pre&s;ence: Rai&s;ed on a Throne, to which
the Brightne&s;s of the Sun would have been dim, the Divine Father of all
Things di&s;clos'd Him&s;elf; His Countenance was mildly aweful; Paternal
Tenderne&s;s &s;hone out in every Feature of His Face, and di&s;|covered a
Concern for us, which, we knew, proceeded from a Divine Idea, <HI>That if He
&s;hould be Merciful, He mu&s;t be more than Ju&s;t.</HI></P> 
<P>ON His Right Hand &s;at the <HI>Second Per&s;on,</HI> our known <HI>Redeemer</HI>; In Him, the Beauty of the Father was divinely manife&s;ted;
In Him, the Glory of His Power at once was &s;often'd, and exerted. Behind Him
the fatal Figure of that Cro&s;s, on which He &s;uffer'd, hung, like a
dread|ful Comet, progno&s;ticating the Hour of Judgment. On the Left, was
placed the <HI>Third</HI> Adorable Per&s;on, in the, now, no longer <HI>My&s;tick Union.</HI> In Him, an equal Mixture of the Father, and the Son,
re|veal'd it&s;elf, uniting, in his Countenance, the &s;evere&s;t Glory of the
One, with the mo&s;t ineffable Sweetne&s;s of the Other.</P> 
<P><PB N="366" REF="375"> BENEATH, and on the Right of the World's
triumphant Saviour, &s;at his Twelve Di&s;ciples: Their Eyes were fix'd on
their great Ma&s;ter's Looks, and &s;eem'd to borrow thence, by Reflection, all
their Softne&s;s, and their Lu&s;tre. In equal Sta|tions, on the Left of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> ap|pear'd tho&s;e Antient <HI>Philo&s;ophers,</HI> who,
through the Dusk of Super&s;tition and Ido|latry, by the Light of Rea&s;on, and
mere Nature, &s;aw, and taught, One True, Eternal God; and in Defence of that
Be|lief, had Courage even to &s;uffer Martyr|dom.</P> 
<P>WHILST I contemplated this Divine Appearance, I heard a Voice,
which, pro|ceeding thence, pierc'd the profounde&s;t Space of Heaven,
proclaming, <HI>That each &s;hould be his own Judge, and from the Te&s;ti|mony
of his own Con&s;cience, acquit, or con|demn him&s;elf.</HI></P> 
<P>IMMEDIATELY all the <HI>Ju&s;t,</HI> and tho&s;e who&s;e
Con&s;ciences, by due Allowances for the Frailties of human Nature, could
ac|quit, and encourage them, advanced, and (with a Mode&s;ty, at once more
humble and a&s;&s;ured, than any thing on Earth) a&s;|&s;erted, and made known,
their Virtues and Obedience to the Divine Commands, concluding, that, though
they had ac|quitted them&s;elves, and were intitled, by the <HI>unalterable
Word,</HI> to Everla&s;ting Feli|city, yet could they not pretend to claim 
<PB N="367" REF="376"> it, 'till they had received the Almighty Sanction, which
they hop'd for, through the Mediation, the Merits, and the Blood of his beloved
Son, who died for Man's Redemption, Pardon, and Salvation. Af|ter which, they
pro&s;trated them&s;elves be|fore the Throne, and, receiving Diadems of Glory, <HI>were admitted as Partakers of Beatitude without End.</HI></P> 
<P>I THEN heard the &s;ame Voice repeat, <HI>Let each be his own Judge,
and from the Te&s;timony of his own Con&s;eience, acquit, or condemn,
him&s;elf;</HI> But, far from &s;eeing any more advance (though &s;till there
were infi|nite Numbers remaining) I ob&s;erv'd, that they drew back,
reproaching each other, beating their Brea&s;ts, and making &s;uch Variety of
Lamentations, that the violent Noi&s;e awaken'd me, in &s;uch a Mixture of Joy,
and Horror, that it will be long be|fore my Memory wears out the Impre&s;&s;ion
of &s;o &s;trong a Vi&s;ion, which, if it affects you enough, to make you judge
it worth publi&s;hing, I &s;hall have <HI>&s;lept,</HI> as I love to <HI>wake,</HI> for the Service, or Warning of others.</P> </Q>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>FRIDAY, <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 21. 1724.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I was vi&s;ited, &s;ome Days ago, by &s;everal of my di&s;tingui&s;h'd
Friends; and, on this Occa&s;ion, mu&s;t particularly name the <HI>Major,</HI>
and <HI>Ned Volatile,</HI> in regard they were the principal Per&s;ons
concerned in that After|noon's Conver&s;ation, which gave Birth to this Day's
Paper.</P>
<P>THE Di&s;cour&s;e turn'd upon a Subject, to which a late unhappy
Rencounter furni&s;h'd too many Materials: 'Twas the Di&s;pute be|tween Two
dear and in&s;eparable Friends, which ended not, but with the Life of one of 
<PB N="369" REF="378"> them. The Per&s;onal Acquaintance, that &s;ome of us had
with one, or both, of the Gen|tlemen, continued our Conver&s;ation longer, and
carried our Reflections farther, than we &s;hould el&s;e have allow'd of, at a
Time, when we met to give, and receive a mutual Plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Point of Honour,</HI> which is u&s;ually the Foundation, upon
which the&s;e unhappy Di&s;|putes are grounded, was, by the <HI>Major,</HI>
beau|tifully explain'd, and &s;et in a ju&s;t Light, oppo&s;ite to the too
generally mi&s;taken Notions of that noble Qualification; and which <HI>Ned</HI> had too warmly debated, 'till <HI>Will. Weather|cock</HI> diverted
his pu&s;hing it to Extremity, by the &s;ea&s;onable Interpo&s;ition of his
peculiar Judgment. <HI>Will's</HI> Deci&s;ions, as the <HI>Pagans</HI> painted
their <HI>Janus,</HI> always appear with <HI>Two Faces,</HI> which favour both
Parties, and recon|cile them in good Humour. Neverthele&s;s, we could not leave
the Subject intirely, with|out a Progre&s;s of Reflection upon the Fa|tality of
&s;udden Startings, and ungovernable Pa&s;&s;ions, which are too much indulg'd,
and but too little provided again&s;t, by the Gene|rality of Mankind.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER 'twas agreed to, that mo&s;t of the ill Blood, Debates, and
Quarrels, that happen, owe their Original to Unconcern, and Carele&s;ne&s;s
about our Humour in Conver|&s;ation. A Man mu&s;t be Ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, and
pre&s;erve a watchful Guard over his Be|haviour in Company, if he would either <HI>plea&s;e,</HI> <PB N="370" REF="379"> or be <HI>plea&s;ed.</HI> There is a
natural Liberty, which all Mankind claims by Right; but the mi&s;taken U&s;e of
it leads to Mi&s;chief. A li|centious, or rambling, Tongue proves, as
in|jurious to Society, as Trea&s;on to a State; and Traitors &s;mart no more,
frequently, for <HI>This Guilt,</HI> than Prattlers for <HI>That
Folly.</HI></P>
<P><HI>NED VOLATILE,</HI> not yet quite cool, broke in upon our Chain of
Rea&s;oning, by a&s;|&s;erting, 
<Q REND="inline">'That a &s;trict Watch over one's Words, Actions, and
Humour, in all Companies, is a Re&s;traint, which, in his Opinion, dif|fer'd
nothing from Torture. What! &s;aid he, mu&s;t I be always under the Slavery of <HI>thinking</HI> before I &s;peak? Shall I never have the Plea&s;ure of
expre&s;&s;ing my own Senti|ments? Who would &s;acrifice his natural Rights, to
plea&s;e another Man? Would any but a <HI>Fool,</HI> or <HI>Flatterer,</HI>
prai&s;e what he <HI>hates</HI>? or declare him&s;elf an Enemy to what he <HI>loves,</HI> merely to &s;hew his <HI>good Humour,</HI> or <HI>Complai&s;ance?</HI> No Gentlemen, I maintain, That <HI>Grandeur
it&s;elf,</HI> would be too dear bought at this Priee; and whoever affirms the
contrary, is no Friend to <HI>Plain-Dealing.</HI></Q></P>
<P>HE paus'd here, and look'd at me for Ap|probation; I was going to
di&s;tingui&s;h, and remark the Circum&s;tances that &s;hould be punctually
regarded, when the <HI>Major</HI> begg'd to be heard. 
<Q REND="inline">'The Re&s;traint, &s;aid he, that you repre&s;ent &s;o
dreadful, gives more Satis|faction, than Pain. Your Complai&s;ance, 
<PB N="371" REF="380"> and good Humour, is more your own In|tere&s;t, than
your, Companion's. Is it not for your own Sake, that you accommodate your&s;elf
to his Humour, from whom you hope good Offices or expect agreeable
En|terainment? Do you take for Di&s;&s;imulation a Guard of Prudence, which
induces you to &s;eem in the Sentiments of a Man, whom you would willingly draw
into yours, when either your Intere&s;t, or Inclination, requires it? For my
Part, I think you have a Right to applaud your&s;elf, when you can enter
agreeably into oppo&s;ite Humours: What induc'd all the Anticents to admire the
pliant Conduct of <HI>Alcibiades?</HI> And why do we <HI>&s;till wonder,</HI>
that a Man could &s;o aptly accommodate him&s;elf to the dif|ferent Manners of
the &s;everal Countries where he liv'd? Nothing was &s;o much talk'd of at <HI>Athens,</HI> as his <HI>Eloquence</HI> and <HI>Gallantry.</HI> Among the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> he was always <HI>fea&s;ting,</HI> and nothing was &s;een
more &s;plendid, than his <HI>Dre&s;s</HI> and <HI>Equipage</HI>; but he
pa&s;s'd over to oppo&s;ite Manners, when he was obliged to go to <HI>Sparta</HI>; for <HI>there</HI> the mo&s;t rigid <HI>Lacedemonian</HI> led
a Life le&s;s <HI>au&s;tere</HI> than <HI>Alcibiades.</HI></Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>ALCIBIADES,</HI> cry'd <HI>Ned Volatile,</HI> was
an Affector of <HI>Popularity.</HI> His Maxim was like that of a Friend of

<PB N="372" REF="381"> Travellers; but <HI>Ned Volatile</HI> has nothing to do
with it.</Q></P>
<P>HE was proceeding, in his u&s;ual Volubility of Speech, when I
interrupted him, in the following Manner.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I AM &s;orry my Friend <HI>Volatile</HI> would de|cry
one of the Ble&s;&s;ings, upon which the Happine&s;s of <HI>Society</HI> is in

of Humours every Day, and when <HI>Nature</HI> denies the Ma&s;tery, of them,
Men &s;hould endeavour to <HI>acquire</HI> it. Who would not <HI>rejoice
with</HI> a Friend, new|ly, and happily, married? <HI>Congratulate one</HI>
ju&s;t arrived from his Travels? Or <HI>Condole</HI> with <HI>another</HI> on
the Lo&s;s of an only, and valuable Son? This is no Supplene&s;s, no Inequality
of Humour? 'Tis a Sweetne&s;s, 'tis a Virtue. Tell me; Would not your|&s;elf,
in the Pre&s;ence of a Gay Prince, de|voted to his Plea&s;ures, appear with a
chearful Countenance? Or, Would you acco&s;t with a &s;miling Air, a cloudy,
and &s;u&s;picious, one? No more is it fitting to carry a Pa&s;&s;i|on into
Company di&s;agreeable to that which reigns in it, or to di&s;cover a <HI>Mien</HI> which condemns the Sentiments wherewith the Company is
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. In &s;hort, no|thing is more oppo&s;ite to the Maxims of
Civil Society, than an Opinionative, and Dog|matical, Conduct; and he who will
ob&s;tinate|ly follow it, is in Danger of never getting new Friends, and even
of lo&s;ing his old <PB N="373" REF="382"> ones. I wi&s;h I could &s;ay, That

That one who is thus Ma&s;ter of his Temper, mu&s;t never abu&s;e this Power;
never betray his Senti|ments, in maintaining an Error, or in giv|ing Prai&s;es

Did one whom I would not di&s;plea&s;e, commend an ill Man, not well known to

&s;ufficient to tell you, That <HI>Honorius</HI> was &s;o di&s;oblig'd, that he

at a Time appointed, in <HI>Hyde-Park.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="384">AT the Time in which <HI>Altamont</HI> received
this Challenge, he was &s;oo deeply ingaged in a Tru&s;t, whereon depended the
Pre&s;ervation of the King's Per&s;on and Government, that he could not
&s;acrifice, or neglect them, by ri&s;quing his important Life, in a Per&s;onal
Quarrel, at that Juncture; but knowing well the Honour and Bravery of <HI>Honorius,</HI> and jealous too of his own, he &s;ent for <HI>Carolinus</HI>

<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Brother,</HI> &s;aid he, You know how much of the

the Satisfaction he requires.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>CAROLINUS,</HI> re&s;olved to act in his Brother's Cau&s;e, as in

of warring Pa&s;&s;ions!&mdash;After a Length of &s;ilent Confu&s;ion, <HI>Honorius</HI> thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to <HI>Carolinus</HI>&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">'You are that very Friend, I ever called, and thought

<P>I DEDICATE this Paper to the Ladies; for I de&s;ign it as a Le&s;&s;on
of <HI>Love:</HI> which a certain perver&s;e Foreigner, will have to be no more
than a Phantom; <HI>Becau&s;e</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Like an Apparition, Every
Body has heard of, but No-body has &s;een it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="387">IT is much ea&s;ier, indeed, <HI>to love,</HI>
than to explain <HI>what Love is</HI>; For it is one, among the <HI>Paradoxes</HI> of that ungovernable Pa&s;&s;ion, that it &s;trikes the
Tongue <HI>dumb</HI>; but makes every other Part of the Body <HI>eloquent.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Major,</HI> to plea&s;e <HI>Ned Volatile,</HI> has indulg'd
him the Peru&s;al of that PICTURE OF LOVE, from which he recited the Ver&s;es,
in my XXXIVth Paper.&mdash;I had the Mis|fortune to be pre&s;ent, and to hear
him read it over. I call it a <HI>Misfortune,</HI> becau&s;e my Pa&s;&s;ion for
that wild <HI>In&s;en&s;ible,</HI> my Coquet, who is rambled away to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> was half &s;uppre&s;s'd before, for want of Occa&s;ion to
in|flame it; but has rekindled it&s;elf, at the Fire which it catch'd from this
unlucky Picture; and I, now, bleed afre&s;h, like a dead Body, at the Touch of
its Murderer.</P>
<P>YET, why do I complain, that I am &s;en|&s;ible of a generous
Pa&s;&s;ion, which, to lay a&s;ide the Pride of Wi&s;dom, and the Forma|lity of
Age, and Gravity, he who is in&s;en&s;i|ble of, is <HI>&s;tupid?</HI>&mdash;The
Philo&s;opher de|fin'd Love prettily, when he &s;aid, It was a <HI>Circle,</HI>
returning <HI>through</HI> Happine&s;s, <HI>to</HI> Happine&s;s, <HI>from</HI>
Happine&s;s. The Emblem was ingenious, and the Lover's <HI>Ring</HI> is a
pro|per, and &s;ignificant, Allu&s;ion to it.</P>
<P>I AM &s;o far, when I think <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly,</HI> from being
a&s;ham'd to be call'd a <HI>Lover,</HI> that I am, &s;incerely, of Opinion,
that whoever has not lov'd, has put his Virtues to no Tryal.&mdash;Love is the
Breeze of Life: A healthful, <PB N="379" REF="388"> and refre&s;hing, <HI>Gale,</HI> which, by its Agitation of the Spirits, keeps our Faculties in
lively Motion; &s;o, as neither to &s;tagnate, in un|fruitful Re&s;t, nor drive
tempe&s;tuou&s;ly, with the mo&s;t &s;tormy Pa&s;&s;ions.&mdash;The Heart of a
Lover is impre&s;s'd with Sweetne&s;s, and Humanity. His Soul receives
Exten&s;ion, beyond its natural Power; and is as much more refin'd, than a <HI>&s;elfi&s;h,</HI> common, Soul, as that Soul, which it &s;o excels, is
above the Body it belongs to.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;omething, in Love, that is &s;tronger than <HI>Calamity,</HI> and more gentle than <HI>Pity!</HI> &s;erener than <HI>Silence,</HI> more &s;plendid than <HI>Riches,</HI> and &s;tatelier than <HI>Honour!</HI> More trembling than <HI>Fear,</HI> and more charming than <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI>! It is, even more powerful than <HI>Con&s;cience:</HI> For
whom we love, we imagine, always, <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing Judg|ment
on our mo&s;t &s;ecret Purpo&s;es. We re|gulate them, therefore, according to
our Apprehen&s;ion of what She would <HI>approve,</HI> or <HI>condemn</HI>;
and, &s;o, &s;upply our&s;elves with a con&s;tant Vigilance, and Propen&s;ity
to noble Actions.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome Sen&s;e, he who <HI>loves,</HI> may be &s;aid to be <HI>like
a God</HI>; for he has but one, Care, and <HI>That,</HI> a Great, and a
Heavenly, One! He is, wholly, intent upon <HI>Beneficence.</HI>&mdash;He has
the Prophet's &s;acred Privilege, to be rapp'd, out of him&s;elf! To enjoy
per|petual Ec&s;tacy! To be emptied of his own Soul, that he may be animated by
one, <PB N="380" REF="389"> more dear to him!&mdash;Our Ideas of the Joys of <HI>Heaven,</HI> can repre&s;ent them no other, than that we are, there, to <HI>love,</HI> and to <HI>be beloved</HI>: And they, who love, here on Earth,
are <HI>above</HI> the World, while they are <HI>in it.</HI> Nor can <HI>Death</HI> di&s;unite Lovers &s;o in|tirely as it does other People,
&s;ince <HI>Love</HI> dies not, with the <HI>Object lov'd.</HI> She lives, &s;o
te|naciou&s;ly, in our charm'd, and retentive, <HI>Memory,</HI> that her Death
&s;eems no more, than a long, and lamented, Ab&s;ence, ra|ther indearing, than
defacing, her Image.&mdash;So that <HI>This</HI> is the only Difference, which
Death &s;eems capable of making, when he interpo&s;es between <HI>Lovers</HI>;&mdash;While both <HI>liv'd,</HI> their <HI>Two Bodies</HI> had
no more than <HI>One Soul:</HI> And, now one is <HI>dead,</HI> their <HI>Two
Souls</HI> hove no more than <HI>One Body.</HI></P>
<P>NEITHER has <HI>Age,</HI> that alters all Things, a Power to deface
our <HI>Love</HI>; for, whom we love, can never &s;eem Old. Our Remem|brance
pre&s;ents her Beauty everla&s;tingly in its Spring: And her Idea is retain'd
inchanting|ly, in the very Attitude, which, fir&s;t, &s;he &s;truck us by.</P>
<P>THE re&s;tle&s;s, but unwearied, Lover, &s;eeks for him&s;elf, <HI>out
of him&s;elf</HI>: Let him gaze, touch, li&s;ten, and be ble&s;s'd, for ever,
yet, &s;till, he <HI>longs,</HI> and is un&s;atisfied!&mdash;There is a
Drop&s;y, in his Mind, and his Thir&s;t augments, with drinking.&mdash;His Soul
is either not at home, or in a &s;tarting, and im|patient Po&s;ture.&mdash;If
he pre&s;&s;es his <PB N="381" REF="390"> Charmer's Hand, it darts, with
Violence, into his <HI>Fingers.</HI> If he leans at her lov'd Side, it beats
again&s;t his <HI>Brea&s;t,</HI> as if it would break its Pri&s;on, to be <HI>nearer</HI> her. When &s;he &s;peaks, it is in his <HI>Ear:</HI> When he
looks on her, it is in his <HI>Eye:</HI> But, he has <HI>no Soul at all,</HI>
when &s;he is ab&s;ent.</P>
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>Ab&s;ent from her, in whom, alone, we live,</L>
<L>Life grows a <HI>Bankrupt,</HI> and no Bli&s;s can give:</L>
<L>Friends are importunate, and Plea&s;ures lo&s;t;</L>
<L>What, once, mo&s;t charm'd us, now, di&s;gu&s;ts us, mo&s;t!</L>
<L>Fretful, to &s;ilent Solitudes we run,</L>
<L>And Men, and Light, and noi&s;y Conver&s;e, &s;hun.</L>
<L>Pen&s;ive, in Woods, on Rivers Sides, we walk,</L>
<L>And to th' unli&s;tning Winds, and Waters, talk.</L>
<L>How, next, we &s;hall approach her, pleas'd, we weigh!</L>
<L>And <HI>think,</HI> in Tran&s;port, All, we mean to &s;ay.</L>
<L>Tenderly bowing, <HI>Thus</HI> will we complain;</L>
<L><HI>Thus,</HI> court her Pity; And, <HI>Thus,</HI> plead our
Pain.</L>
<L><HI>Thus,</HI> &s;igh, for fancied Frowns, if Frowns &s;hou'd
ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And <HI>Thus,</HI> meet Favours, in her &s;oftning Eyes.</L>
<L>Re&s;tle&s;s, on Paper, we our Vows repeat,</L>
<L>And pour our <HI>Souls</HI> out, on the letter'd Sheet.</L>
<L>Write, blot, re&s;tore, and in lo&s;t Pieces, rend</L>
<L>The <HI>Mute Entreaters;</HI> yet, too faint, to &s;end.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Unble&s;s'd, when no Admi&s;&s;ion we procure,</L>
<L>'Tis Heav'n, at Di&s;tance, to di&s;cern her Door.</L>
<L><PB N="382" REF="391">Or, to her Window, we, by Night repair;</L>
<L>And let loo&s;e Fancy, to be fea&s;ted, there.</L>
<L>Watch her lov'd Shadow, as it glances by:</L>
<L>And, to imagin'd Motions, chain our Eye.</L>
<L>Has &s;he &s;ome Field, or Grove, or Garden, ble&s;s'd?</L>
<L>Pleas'd, we retread the Paths her Feet have pre&s;s'd.</L>
<L>Near her, by Chance, at Vi&s;its, or at Plays,</L>
<L>Our ru&s;hing Spirits croud, in <HI>&s;peaking Gaze,</HI></L>
<L>Light, on her varied Airs, our Eye-balls ride,</L>
<L>Dark, as the Dead, to the full World, be&s;ide.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>LOVERS conver&s;e, like Angels, by a kind of <HI>Intuition</HI>! They <HI>hear</HI> one another's <HI>Souls</HI>; and prevent each other's <HI>Wi&s;hes.</HI>&mdash;Like Divinities quitting their Shrines, they di&s;robe
them&s;elves of their <HI>Bodies</HI>; and intermingle their meeting <HI>Minds,</HI> as we &s;ee Two <HI>Lights</HI> incorporate.&mdash;Their Souls
glide out, from their Eyes, to &s;natch Embraces, at a Di|&s;tance; and return,
inrich'd, with the fan|cy'd Trea&s;ure.&mdash;There is more Harmony, in Love,
than in Mu&s;ick: A Harmony! like that which the old Philo&s;ophers imputed to
the Spheres! Only Two Spheres are <HI>acted</HI>; by one, and the &s;ame, <HI>Intelligence.</HI> For the Strings of Two Hearts &s;ympathize, like tho&s;e
of Two Lutes, with corre&s;pondent Trepida|tions.</P>
<P>HOW mi&s;taken are they, who call Love an <HI>idle</HI>
Pa&s;&s;ion!&mdash;<HI>Thought</HI> it&s;elf is &s;carce more active. There is
an un&s;atisfied, and continual Thir&s;t, in the Appetite of a Lover: 
<PB N="383" REF="392"> A con&s;tant Spring, in his Delights, and Tor|ments. He
pur&s;ues his Di&s;coveries, with a re&s;tle&s;s, and impatient, Vigour: And,
tho' like the &s;hining, heavenly, Bodies, he is, everla&s;tingly, in Motion,
yet, he is &s;o far from becoming weary, that he is rather refre&s;h'd, by his
Labour.</P>
<P>I WILL copy, yet farther, from the Pi|cture abomentioned, the
following <HI>Group,</HI> or A&s;&s;embly, of the <HI>Symptoms, Moles,</HI> and <HI>To|kens</HI> of this Pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;It is upon the Lover's fir&s;t
Approach to his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Per&s;on: We recover, &s;lowly, from our &s;weet
Surprize, &s;ays this <HI>Doctor</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI>'s-<HI>College,</HI>
and, ad|vancing, with a blu&s;hful Tenderne&s;s, 
<Q>

<L>Bowing, we kneel; and her giv'n Hand is pre&s;s'd,</L>
<L>With &s;weet Compul&s;ion, to our beating Brea&s;t:</L>
<L>O'er it, in Ec&s;tacy, our Lips bend low,</L>
<L>And Tides of Sighs, 'twixt her gra&s;p'd Fingers, flow.</L>
<L>High beats the hurried Pul&s;e, at each, forc'd, Ki&s;s:</L>

<L>Life, in a <HI>Souly Deluge,</HI> ru&s;hes o'er;</L>

</LG>

<L>The fir&s;t fierce Raptures, of Amazement, pa&s;t,</L>
<L>Confu&s;ion quits us, and De&s;ire grows, fa&s;t.</L>
<L>We &s;it: And, while her gaz'd at Wonders ri&s;e,</L>
<L>A humid Brightne&s;s fills our &s;parkling Eyes:</L>
<L>Mode&s;t Di&s;quiet, every Action wears;</L>
<L>And each, long Look, the Mark of Pa&s;&s;ion bears.</L>
<L><PB N="384" REF="393">Di&s;order'd Nature, no cold <HI>Medium</HI> keeps;</L>

</LG></Q></P>
<P>I AM fond of thinking we might draw, from Love, a Proof of the <HI>Soul's Immortality:</HI> What, el&s;e, mean our De&s;ires, when they
ex|tend them&s;elves, beyond the utmo&s;t, that willing Nature can indulge us
in.&mdash;Why, el&s;e, are the Joys of Love mix'd with me|lancholy, 
<PB N="385" REF="394"> and un&s;atisfied Tremblings?&mdash;They increa&s;e,
indeed, and refine, the Plea|&s;ure: But they convince us, That there <HI>is</HI> a Union, more adapted to our Mind's free E&s;|&s;ence; and, which,
Bodies are not <HI>fine</HI> enough to permit them the Enjoyment of.</P>
<P>HENCE, that exqui&s;ite <HI>Expan&s;ion!</HI> That <HI>Liquefaction,</HI> of the Heart! when it refu&s;es to allow us the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our deare&s;t Wi&s;h, in the very Moment we become
Ma&s;ters of it! The &s;ubtle Workings of this exalted Pa&s;|&s;ion, upon the
Refinements of our Mind, have <HI>Deified</HI> the beloved Object, 'till we
faint, with Awe, when we &s;hould receive her Ten|derne&s;s: And, by a
fanta&s;tical kind of Envy, con&s;ider our&s;elves, as our own
Rivals!&mdash;The <HI>&s;upreme&s;t Joy</HI> of Love mu&s;t, if Men will have
it &s;o, be <HI>call'd Bodily:</HI> But All, that heightens it, to be worth the

for.&mdash;Whence could Images &s;o <HI>warm,</HI> as the&s;e which follow,
receive a Purity, in their Expre&s;&s;ion, that adapts them to the cha&s;te&s;t
Ear, if the <HI>Mind</HI>'s Part were not &s;tronge&s;t, even where the <HI>Body</HI> pretends mo&s;t Influence?</P>
<Q> 
<L>Is there no more? Oh! yet the <HI>La&s;t</HI> remains!</L> 
<L>Crown of our Conque&s;t! Sweetner of our Pains!</L> 
<L>There <HI>is a Time,</HI> when Love no Wi&s;h denies:</L> 
<L>And &s;miling Nature throws off All Di&s;gui&s;e.</L>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR PLAIN DEALER, of <HI>July</HI> the 24th, was &s;ent to me by a
Friend. I mu&s;t own, after I had read it over, I was both &s;urpriz'd and
pleas'd to find, that a &s;imple Tale of my Writing, had merited the Notice,
and Approbation, of the Au|thor of the PLAIN DEALER.</P>
<P>AFTER what you have &s;aid, of WILLIAM and MARGARET, I flatter
my&s;elf, that you will not be di&s;pleas'd with an Account of the Accident
which gave Birth to that Ballad.</P>
<P>YOUR Conjecture, that it was founded on the real Hi&s;tory of an
unhappy Woman, is true&mdash;A vain, young, Gentleman, had, for &s;ome Time,
profe&s;&s;ed Love to a Lady, then in the Spring of her Life, and Beauty. He
dre&s;s'd well, talk'd loud, and &s;poke Non&s;en&s;e, with <HI>Spirit:</HI>
She had good Under&s;tanding; but was too young to know the World. I have
&s;een her, very often. There was a lively Innocence in her Look. She had never
been addre&s;s'd to by a Man of <HI>Sen&s;e:</HI> And, therefore, knew not how
de&s;picable, and un&s;incere, a <HI>Fool</HI> is. In time, he per&s;uaded her,
that there was <PB N="389" REF="398"> Merit in his Pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;She
believ'd him, and was <HI>undone.</HI></P>
<P>SHE was upon the Point of bringing in|to the World the Effect of her
ill-plac'd Love, before her Father knew the Misfor|tune. Judge the Sentiments
of the good Old Man! yet his Affection outweighed his Anger. He could not think
of aban|doning his Child, to Want, and Infamy. He applied him&s;elf to her
fal&s;e Lover, with an Offer of Half his Fortune; But the Temper of the
Betrayer was &s;avag'd, with cruel In&s;o|lence. He rejected the Father's
Offers, and re|proach'd the Innocence he had ruin'd, with the Bitterne&s;s of
open Scorn. The News was brought her, when in a weak Condi|tion, and ca&s;t her
into a Fever. And, in a few Days after, I &s;aw her, and her Child, laid in one
Grave, together.</P>
<P>IT was &s;ome Time after this, That I chanc'd to look into a Comedy
of <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s, called, <HI>The Knight of the burning Pe&s;tle.</HI>
The Place I fell upon was, where old <HI>Mer|ry-Thought</HI> repeats the&s;e
Ver&s;es; 
<Q> 
<L>When it was grown to dark Midnight,</L> 
<L>And all were fa&s;t a&s;leep:</L> 
<L>In came <HI>Margaret</HI>'s grimly Gho&s;t,</L> 
<L>And &s;tood at <HI>William</HI>'s Feet.</L> </Q> </P>
<P>WHICH, I fancy, was the Beginning of &s;ome Ballad, commonly known,
at the Time, when this Author wrote.&mdash;The&s;e <PB N="390" REF="399">
Lines, naked of Ornament, and &s;imple, as they are, &s;truck my Fancy; I
clos'd the Book, and bethought my&s;elf, that the un|happy Adventure, I have
mentioned above, which then came fre&s;h into my Mind, might naturally rai&s;e
a Tale, upon the Appearance of this Gho&s;t.&mdash;It was, then, Midnight. All,
round me, was &s;till, and quiet. The&s;e concurring Circum&s;tances work'd my
Soul to a powerful Melancholy. I could not &s;leep. And, at that Time, I
fini&s;h'd my little Poem, &s;uch as you &s;ee it here. If it continues &s;till
to de&s;erve your Approbation, I have my Aim; and am,</P>

true Judges of Wit, and Nature. The Author's Copy, which he inclos'd to me, is
different in &s;everal Places, from that which fell into my Hands; but the
Sen&s;e of both, is exactly the &s;ame; and the Variation, in &s;ome
Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, not con&s;iderable enough to make it nece&s;&s;ary to
republi&s;h that excellent Ballad.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="400">HAVING this Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> I judge it the propere&s;t Place to in&s;ert my

<P>THE fir&s;t PLAIN DEALER, that came to my Hand, was that, where|in
you repre&s;ent, in true Colours, the Character, and Conduct, of the pre&s;ent
Emperor of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> with Regard to his Son, Prince <HI>Alexei.</HI>&mdash;My Fancy was charm'd, and my Judgment intirely
&s;atisfied, with the Account you gave: Our Coffee-Hou&s;es take in your
Papers, and I ob&s;erve, with Plea&s;ure, the Welcome which our polite&s;t
People receive them with. Not the Men alone, of all Ranks, but the Ladies
al&s;o, make them their Entertainment. The ge|neral Conver&s;ation of both
Sexes turns, on the Matter you afford.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help writing to you, that I may let you know your
Influence. It mu&s;t <PB N="392" REF="401"> be a Plea&s;ure to your generous
Soul, to be con&s;cious of the Extent, and Power, of its Beneficence: And I
&s;hould be wanting in my Duty to the Man, who gives me Weekly Delight, and
In&s;truction, if I con|ceal'd from him, what might, any way, contribute to his
Satisfaction.</P>
<P>I WILL pre&s;ume, if you plea&s;e, to &s;end you, now-and-then, my
Reflections, upon the Matter which the <HI>Beaux,</HI> and <HI>Belles,</HI> of
this City, may furni&s;h, for a PLAIN-DEALER. Something happens here every Day,
not un|worthy Publick Notice. And there are a Thou&s;and Things, that fall,
naturally, un|der your Cognizance, that neither the <HI>King,</HI> the <HI>Parliament,</HI> the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> or the <HI>Bench,</HI> have any Thing
to do with. Perhaps, too, it would be of U&s;e to our Gentry, at <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> to know, you have a <HI>Spy,</HI> here, up|on their

</LETTER>
<P>I CANNOT forbear confe&s;&s;ing, that I &s;hall expect, with a very
&s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure, the Event of this Northern Corre&s;pondence: For I
have retain'd, from my Infancy a kind <PB N="393" REF="402"> of affectionate
Partiality, for the generous Bravery, and gallant Plainne&s;s, of our
Bro|thers, beyond <HI>Tweed.</HI> When I travell'd, in my Youth, I &s;carce
ever &s;aw a Court, even in the remote&s;t Parts of the civiliz'd World, where
&s;ome Gentleman, or other, a <HI>Scot,</HI> by Birth, or De&s;cent, was not,
one, of its noble&s;t Ornaments: And, now, &s;ince the <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> and
the <HI>Graces,</HI> have, very vi&s;ibly, from the Begin|ning of the pre&s;ent
Century, fix'd, and &s;eated them&s;elves, in their learned Seminaries, their
ri&s;ing Youth, of both Sexes, &s;eem to vie, with one another, in a warm, and
generous, Emulation which &s;hall mo&s;t adorn their own, or &s;oone&s;t match
the Elegance, of other, even the po|lite&s;t, Nations.</P>
<P>NOT the Gentlemen alone, but the very Ladies, of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
form them&s;elves into &s;elect, and voluntary, <HI>Societies,</HI> for the
Im|provement of their Knowledge, in&s;tead of the Entertainment of their Fancy:
And go on, at the &s;ame Time, to refine their Conver&s;a|tion, inrich their
Under&s;tanding, and poli&s;h, and render amiable, their Per&s;onal
Deport|ment.</P>
<P>I SHALL, in the Cour&s;e of my Ob&s;erva|tions, take Occa&s;ion to
demon&s;trate the Truth of this Remark, by a Variety of Particulars; which,
while they are doing Ju&s;tice to the <HI>North,</HI> will contribute, in no
&s;mall Degree, to the Plea&s;ure of the <HI>South</HI> Part of this King|dom.
At pre&s;ent, I &s;hall produce but Two In&s;tances: And the Fir&s;t is, A
Society of <PB N="394" REF="403"> Young Gentlemen, mo&s;t, if not all of them,
Students in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> who from a Sympathy of
Affections, found|ded on a Similitude of <HI>Parts,</HI> and <HI>Genius,</HI>
have united them&s;elves into a Body, under Title of THE GROTESQUE CLUB; the
Rea&s;on of which Name, I &s;hall explain in a future Paper. Their
Bu&s;ine&s;s, to expre&s;s it in the Words of one of their own Members, is, <HI>A Friend&s;hip that knows no Strife, but that of a generous Emulation, to
excell, in Virtue, Learn|ing, and Politene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>TO how &s;urprizing a Degree the&s;e fine Spirits have &s;ucceeded, in
their noble <HI>End,</HI> let the following Sentiments declare; conceiv'd, and
expre&s;s'd, with all the Clearne&s;s, Depth, and Strength, of an <HI>experienc'd Philo&s;opher,</HI> by a Member of this <HI>Grote&s;que
Club,</HI> who was in his <HI>Fourteenth Year only,</HI> when he compos'd, in
Blank Ver&s;e, a Poem, now in my Hands; and founded on a Suppo&s;ition of the
Author's &s;itting, a whole Summer Night, in a Gar|den, looking upward, and
quite lo&s;ing him|&s;elf, in Contemplation on <HI>the Works, and Wonders, of
Almighty Power.</HI>&mdash;If this was a Subject, naturally above the Capacity
of &s;o very a Boy, to what a Degree does it in|crea&s;e our Wonder, when we
find it treated, in this Ma&s;terly Manner!</P>

<L>&mdash;Ah! my lov'd God! in vain, a tender Youth,</L>
<L>Unskill'd, in Arts of deep Philo&s;ophy,</L>
<L>Attempts to &s;earch the bulky Ma&s;s of <HI>Matter:</HI></L>
<L>To trace the Rules of <HI>Motion:</HI> and pur&s;ue</L>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a Young Man, about Three and Twenty, that much again&s;t my
Will, have complied with the ince&s;&s;ant Importu|nities of my Friends; or,
rather, obey'd the ab&s;olute Commands of an indulgent Father, and a fond
Mother, in marrying a very Rich Maid of about Thirty Six, who, it &s;eems, is
only mine, becau&s;e &s;everal Sui|ters of equal Preten&s;ions in Wealth with
her&s;elf, that liked her Per&s;on, left her, as &s;oon as they had conver&s;ed
with her &s;uffici|ently to &s;ound her Temper.</P>
<P>BEFORE I married her, I enjoyed Health, and good Humour, and thought
my For|tune good enough as it was, and abundant|ly &s;ufficient, with a Female
Companion that brought the like Ingredients towards it, to make Life tolerably
happy.</P>
<P>SHE has not been my Wife, quite a Year, and yet has managed her Time
&s;o well, that &s;he has robb'd me of all my Quiet. The natural Gayety of my
Di&s;po&s;ition is &s;owr'd, almo&s;t enough to make me think of grow|ing her
Torturer, as &s;he is mine: The Flo|ridne&s;s of Health has left me; and I am
overcome by an inward Pining, that wa&s;tes me outwardly: In fine, &s;he has
convinced me, that a Man may be emphatically Poor in the Affluence of Wealth,
and truly, and properly &s;aid to Want, amid&s;t the Abun|dance of all
Things.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="408"> I HAVE indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;tudied to &s;hew
Gratitude, and true Friend&s;hip. For I really had an Intention to render
my|&s;elf as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible; and the more, becau&s;e, during the
Time of our <HI>modi&s;h</HI> Court&s;hip, &s;he had told tho&s;e, from whom I
&s;hould hear it again, that &s;he lik'd me: By this <HI>habitual Art</HI> of <HI>Tender|ne&s;s,</HI> I almo&s;t brought it to be <HI>Natural,</HI> and began
to deceive my&s;elf into an Opini|on, that I &s;hould not be incapable of even <HI>loving</HI> her at la&s;t. She, in Return, began, after a manner <HI>then</HI> perfectly unaccountable, to do every Thing, not only that &s;he
thought would di&s;oblige me, but that &s;he knew would be a &s;incere

is <HI>Dumb</HI>; but if I drop an ambiguous Word, that may be tortured into a
malig|nant Con&s;truction, &s;he can u&s;e her Tongue like a Larum.&mdash;If I
explain, the Sim|plicity <PB N="400" REF="409"> of my Meaning, and beg Pardon
for want of Caution in expre&s;&s;ing my-&s;elf; her <HI>Ears</HI> are <HI>&s;hut,</HI> and &s;he is like the <HI>Deaf Adder.</HI> The Compari&s;on is
true beyond the <HI>Deafne&s;s:</HI> &s;he is like it in my Bo&s;om; &s;he
&s;tings like it, &s;he poi&s;ons like it, only with this Difference, That her
Poi&s;on is of an <HI>Italian kind</HI>; it lengthens out Torment, and kills,
at Di&s;tance of Years, after a painful Confinement.</P>
<P>IN my Father's Pre&s;ence, this fair Hy|pocrite, is never <HI>dumb,</HI> but ever <HI>eloquent</HI> in <HI>my</HI> Prai&s;e.&mdash;Such a
Husband! and &s;uch a Wife! We are the happie&s;t Couple:&mdash;Then &s;he
calls often upon me, with an Air of Friend&s;hip, to be merry, under the
Ef|fects of the Melancholy &s;he cau&s;es. Her <HI>Eyes,</HI> her <HI>Ears,</HI> her <HI>Tongue,</HI> her <HI>Hands,</HI> &s;eem all too little

could have in|joined me nothing of greater Con&s;equence, or more agreeable,

Macrinus,</HI> eminent in <PB N="403" REF="412"> the <HI>Eque&s;trian</HI>
Order, for he aimed no high|er, being cho&s;e by <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> into
the <HI>Prae|torian,</HI> with great Con&s;tancy preferr'd an hone&s;t Ea&s;e
to this our Ambition (&s;hall I call it?) or Honour. His Grandmother, of the
Mother's Side, is <HI>Serana Procula</HI> of <HI>Pa|dua</HI>; you are
acquainted with the Manners of the Place, yet <HI>Serana</HI> is to the <HI>Patavins</HI> an Example of &s;trict Virtue. His Uncle <HI>P. Acilius</HI>
is a Man of &s;ingular Di&s;cretion, Prudence, and Hone&s;ty; in Truth, you
will meet with nothing in the whole Fami|ly le&s;s agreeable than in your own. <HI>Acili|anus</HI> him&s;elf, has a great deal of Vigour and Indu&s;try,
accompanied with the utmo&s;t Mode&s;ty. And having already di&s;charged the
Offices of <HI>Que&s;tor, Tribune,</HI> and <HI>Praetor,</HI> with Abundance of
Credit, yet he has re|ferr'd it to you to make his Court for him. He has a
comely Face, a &s;anguine Comple|ction, his whole Per&s;on Gentleman-like, with
a becoming Gravity in his Mein, Things, I think, not to be di&s;regarded, but
due to the Merit of a virtuous Woman. I am in Doubt, whether I need take
No|tice of the large E&s;tate of his Father; for when I con&s;ider You, for
whom we propo&s;e a Son-in-Law, I think I need not: When I reflect on the <HI>Common Cu&s;tom,</HI> and even the Laws of the City, which principally have
Regard to the Fortunes of Men, <HI>that</HI> &s;eems, by no Means, to be
omitted, and to one that thinks of Po&s;terity; this, in <PB N="404" REF="413">
the making of a Match, is not the lea&s;t material Con&s;ideration. Perhaps you
will think I have indulged too much the Love of my Friend in this Account; but
I will &s;take my Credit, you &s;hall find every thing exceed my De&s;cription:
I love the young Man, indeed, mo&s;t ardently, as he de&s;erves; but it is the
Duty of Friend&s;hip, to be mo|derate in Commendation.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To <HI>HISPULLA,</HI> his Wife's Aunt.</HEAD>
<P>AS I remember that great Affection, which was between you and your
ex|cellent Brother, and know you love his Daughter as your own, &s;o as not
only to expre&s;s the Tenderne&s;s of the be&s;t of Aunts; but even &s;upply
that of the be&s;t of Fathers: I am &s;ure it will be a Plea&s;ure to you to
hear, that &s;he proves worthy of her Father, worthy of you, and of your and
her An|ce&s;tors. Her Ingenuity is admirable, her Frugality extraordinary: She
loves me, the &s;ure&s;t Pledge of her Virtue, and adds to this, a wonderful
Di&s;po&s;ition to Learning, which &s;he has acquired from her Affection to me:
She reads my Writings, &s;tudies them, and even gets them by Heart: You would
&s;mile to &s;ee the Concern &s;he is in, when I have a Cau&s;e to plead, and
the Joy &s;he &s;hews, when it is over: She finds Means to have the fir&s;t
News brought her, of the Succe&s;s I meet with in Court; how I am heard, and
what Decree is made. If I <PB N="405" REF="414"> recite any Thing in Publick,
&s;he cannot refrain from placing her&s;elf privately in &s;ome Corner to hear,
where, with the ut|mo&s;t Delight, &s;he fea&s;ts on my Applau&s;es. Sometimes
&s;he &s;ings my Ver&s;es, and accom|panies them with the <HI>Lute,</HI>
without any Ma&s;ter, except Love, the be&s;t of In&s;tru|ctors. From the&s;e
In&s;tances I take the mo&s;t certain Omens of our perpetual and in|crea&s;ing
Happine&s;s, &s;ince her Affection is not founded on my Youth and Per&s;on,
which mu&s;t gradually decay; but &s;he is in Love with the immutable Part of
me, my Glory and Reputation. Nor, indeed, could be le&s;s expected from One,
who had the Happine&s;s to receive her Education from you; who, in your Hou&s;e
was accu&s;tomed to every Thing that was virtuous and de|cent, and even began
to love me by your Recommendation: For, as you had always the greate&s;t
Re&s;pect for my Mother, you were plea&s;ed from my Infancy to form me, to
commend me, and kindly to pre&s;age, I &s;hould be, One Day, what my Wife
fan|cies I am. Accept therefore our united Thanks; mine, that you have
be&s;towed her on me, and hers, that you have given me to her, as a mutual
Grant of Joy and Felicity.</P>

<P>DETRACTORS may be &s;aid to lead their Lives in a Habit of mo&s;t
injurious Fal&s;hood towards good Men, and of the mo&s;t offen&s;ive Impiety to
Heaven. Per&s;ons, of this itching and abandoned Appetite, may, If we
con&s;ider the numerous Mi&s;chiefs they do to human Society, be compared to
the mo&s;t ravenous Bea&s;ts of Prey, with this Difference, That, as Bea&s;ts
of Prey do good &s;ometimes, in worrying one another, the&s;e, on the
con|trary, will not fall upon, or devour any thing but what is excellent.</P>
<P>WIT, Wi&s;dom, Beauty, good Humour, Mode&s;ty, Valour, Integrity, in
fine, all the Virtues and all the Graces, which can illu&s;trate any Per&s;on
of either Sex, are as &s;o many tempt|ing <PB N="407" REF="416"> <HI>Spoils</HI> to the &s;avage Slanderer, and &s;trong Provocatives to
Detraction. There is &s;carce a Man living, that has many little, infamous
Srories, more than ordinary, privately handed about wirh great Indu&s;try, from
one to ano|ther, in order to depreciate his Character in the World, but what
will be found, upon a clo&s;e Examination, to have merited publick Ap|plau&s;e
for &s;ome noble Action or other; Ex|amine &s;till farther, and it will as
certainly be found, that <HI>that</HI> noble Action was the very Source of a <HI>&s;ecret</HI> Envy and a <HI>private</HI> Hatred, which broke out in a
Hundred <HI>whi&s;per'd Tra|ditions,</HI> till it &s;pread and inlarged
it&s;elf into <HI>publick Defamation.</HI></P>
<P>THE mo&s;t unhappy Circum&s;tances which attend the illu&s;trious
Sufferers in this Way, I reckon to be the&s;e; That, as Per&s;ons, who &s;eek
after Fame the mo&s;t eagerly, do, for the mo&s;t part, very plentifully
de&s;erve it; &s;o they are the mo&s;t frequently interrupted in the Search,
and the lea&s;t able to bear the Trouble of &s;uch unwelcome Interruptions. No
Men are more <HI>Ideally</HI> fond of Glory, than &s;uch as mo&s;t <HI>&s;ub&s;tantially</HI> de&s;erve it; this is a plea&s;ant Weakne&s;s: But
then no Men have a quicker Sen&s;ibility of unju&s;t Reproaches than tho&s;e
who take Care never to de&s;erve them; and this is a &s;ore Frailty, which
opens, through the Bo&s;oms of the Generous and the Innocent, a Way to a
Thou&s;and unnece&s;&s;ary <HI>Heart-Achs.</HI> It is Pity, it &s;hould be &s;o
much in the Power of Calumny, as Experience &s;hews it is, to &s;trike 
<PB N="408" REF="417"> a Damp upon the mo&s;t Generous Spirits, and throw a
Load over an a&s;piring Mind, that is upon the Stretch after Glory. But what
&s;eems at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t of all to be regretted; is, That, by the
frequent Complaints I have lately received, this Vice is as prevailing, as it
is in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>I HAVE a Letter from a Gentleman, containing a very lively
De&s;cription of a Lady, who&s;e Charms have been &s;o long drown|ed in Tears,
that they are almo&s;t worn out and carried away by the wa&s;ting Tide of her
Sor|row, which &s;he hides, but cannot &s;top:&mdash;He proceeds to tell me, 
<Q REND="inline">"That, upon Inquiry into the Source of this mighty
Woe, he finds it aro&s;e from Two or Three ambiguous and broken Sentences,
glancing at her Virtue, and Conver&s;ation, artfully dropp'd by a malicious
Woman in the Ear of a Youth of a Jealous Di&s;po&s;ition, who loved her whom <HI>&s;he</HI> loved, who was contracted to her, and departed from her on this
Account.&mdash;What &s;ignifies talking to her of her inno|cence, and telling
her, that no Mortal liv|ing credits it but that <HI>one</HI> Jealous young
Man?&mdash;Alas! it is only <HI>his</HI> not be|lieving it, that mu&s;t pour
Comfort upon her Affliction.&mdash;'Till then &s;he mu&s;t re|main as <HI>Incon&s;olable,</HI> as &s;he is <HI>Innocent.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>MY Corre&s;pondent goes on to &s;ay, 
<Q REND="inline">"That he had the Curio&s;ity to go and &s;ee this
De|tractre&s;s. He found her, as he tells me, Old, Wrinkled, Ugly; her Vi&s;age
of a pale, ju&s;t turning black, as with a Mor|tification; 
<PB N="409" REF="418"> her Con&s;cience he takes to be much of a Complexion
with her, Face; for, when he charged her with it, &s;he own'd it as &s;ome <HI>trifling Mi&s;take</HI>; then, drawing her Mouth into a &s;cornful Smile,
to con|tradict her Words, cries out, That <HI>&s;he did not mean it as it was
taken.</HI>&mdash;When the <HI>fatal</HI> Con&s;equences were pre&s;s'd upon

<P>ANOTHER Account has been lately tran|&s;mitted to me, concerning a
young Gentle|man, who is &s;aid to have numerous good <PB N="410" REF="419">
Qualities, and has been divided from the E&s;timation of his Friend, by the as
con&s;tant as fal&s;e In&s;inuations of a wor&s;e than once perjured Woman; who
in&s;i&s;ts, That the young Gentleman betrayed his Friend's Liberty for a
Bribe.&mdash;The contrary has been made out, and atte&s;ted to her
Face&mdash;She con|tinues, behind his Back, to load him with the
Calumny.&mdash;Finding, &s;ince &s;he began her Evil Reports, that they would
not take with|out putting on an Air of Charity and Sanctity, &s;he now
concludes her Story to Srrangers thus. 
<Q REND="inline">"&mdash;He (meaning the Per&s;on &s;he aims to
&s;candalize) is generally allowed to be a good Man, an hone&s;t

under the Sun.&mdash;I have &s;o often Occa&s;ion to Wonder, that I am
re&s;olved never to let any Thing, for the Future, &s;urprize me into a Fit of
Admiration.&mdash;He is no Lover of Money&mdash;that is certain, as &s;ome
&s;ay.&mdash;But, &s;ay they what they will, there is &s;uch a Prevalence in
Bribes, no one knows his own Strength till he be tri|ed.&mdash;There is no

be true.</HI>"&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>HERE my Corre&s;pondent &s;ays, he asked the Detractre&s;s, <HI>How
Every-Body came to know it?</HI> and &s;he immediately boa&s;ted, That &s;he 
<PB N="411" REF="420"> was the Di&s;coverer of it, to all who heard it at <HI>fir&s;t Hand,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"To what, continues he, may we properly liken &s;uch a
dangerous Crea|ture as this is, who puts out fal&s;e Colours that &s;he may
come up &s;afe, and rob Virtue, un&s;u&s;pected? She can be compared to
no|thing that re&s;embles her &s;o nearly as a <HI>Witch,</HI> in one of
tho&s;e fatal Operations, where Murder is the Con&s;equence of her

the bewitch'd Body peri&s;hes; and where the Detractre&s;s ends any of her

<P>I HAVE been Married about Two Years to a Young Woman that is every

Super&s;titious. The Truth is, &s;he was determined in her Choice of me by the

than in good Rea&s;on I <PB N="413" REF="422"> &s;hould. I may &s;afely &s;ay,
without Super&s;ti|tion, that I &s;hall like him for having cau|&s;ed my good
Fortune, by foretelling it, the longe&s;t Day I have to live. She would be the
be&s;t-natur'd Creature in the World, if her Mind was not haunted by Spirits,
Sto|ries of which, take up mo&s;t of her Con|ver&s;ation by Day, and make her
waken me a Nights very frequently. I laugh'd at the&s;e little Tales at
fir&s;t, but, not being able to get her out of them, I indulged her in the
relating them, which &s;he has conti|nued to do &s;o prettily, that, though I
know, according to right Rea&s;on, I ought not to be Terrified, I am brought to
trem|ble at the tumbling of a Salt&s;eller.&mdash;If my Wife could be once
cured, I am &s;ure I &s;hould be well &s;oon after.&mdash;She has been for
the&s;e Three Months la&s;t, counting our Hours by a Death-watch, and has made
me almo&s;t &s;ick with Fear, that &s;he, who &s;o often &s;peaks of her Death,
&s;hould die in good Earne&s;t&mdash;This &s;plenetick Ca&s;t of her Temper
having an Effect on me, who &s;ympathize with her in every Thing, throws a
Gloom over our Hours, which would otherwi&s;e pa&s;s as delightfully, as any

<P>THE E&s;timation, of publick Actions, &s;eems to me to be unju&s;tly
calculated, Men derive the <HI>Quality</HI> of Actions from that of the Actor;
Would it not be more ju&s;t to mea&s;ure the Actor by the Action? The An|cients
con&s;idered the Degrees of Superiority to con&s;i&s;t in tho&s;e of Merit and
Virtue. <HI>Pliny</HI> has di&s;tingui&s;h'd him&s;elf, by Remarks, on this
Head, in his admirable Epi&s;tles, and tho' he was at the <HI>Head</HI> of the <HI>Nobles,</HI> as well as the <HI>Wits</HI> of his Age, he thought it not
below him, to pay Acknowledgments, <PB N="420" REF="429"> nay, refined
Compliments, to the Merit of Per&s;ons in low Life; but took a worthy Pride in
rai&s;ing them from the Ob&s;curity, annexed to that Condition, by a <HI>Compari&s;on</HI> with the highe&s;t renowned for Deeds which &s;prang from
the &s;ame Greatne&s;s and Elevati|on of Spirit. As Titles are often but
Acci|dents, this is a ju&s;t Way of Judging; &s;ince Worth is not the
Con&s;equence of a Name, but a great Name ought ever to be the Con&s;equence of
Virtue.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"MODERN Writers," &s;aid our <HI>Critick,</HI> the
other Evening, "have gone into a different Turn of Thinking: They extol, to the
Skies, the indifferent Actions, and palliate the Blemi&s;hes, of Titled People,
who di&s;grace the Figure of Life they ap|pear in; but meanly, decline the
right U&s;e of Art upon Subjects, where they might point out Greatne&s;s in
ob&s;cure Men, who were never <HI>little</HI> in any Thing but the <HI>Accident</HI> of their Birth, and who <HI>living</HI> and <HI>dying,</HI>
did an Honour to Human Nature. Such Pen-men may be called, <HI>The Rabble of
the Wits,</HI> who are dazled by the fal&s;e Glare of the Great, but can look
at &s;olid, Virtue, without the lea&s;t Emotion, or Sign, of being able to
&s;ee it. The Stiles of the&s;e petty Panegyri&s;ts, are, like their Subjects,
glittering, but not &s;olid; &s;wel|ling, but rather empty than great; they
&s;eem never to have heard of that beautiful <PB N="421" REF="430"> Simplicity,
which ari&s;es out of Nature, and forms the Sublime, &s;o much admired by the
Readers, and &s;o ma&s;terly executed by the Writers of Antiquity."</Q></P>
<P>WE were led into this Track of Thinking, by my looking, the other Day,
into a little Book, call'd, <HI>The Hi&s;tory of the Pre&s;ervation of</HI>
Charles <HI>the Second, after the noted Battle of</HI> Worce&s;ter; which was
fought in the Year 1651, on the Third of this very Month of <HI>September.</HI>
I there meet with &s;uch a prodigi|ous In&s;tance of Fidelity, and Loyalty, in
a poor mean Country Fellow, nam'd <HI>Pendrell,</HI> and all his <HI>Family,</HI> that I know not <HI>any</HI> &s;o Illu&s;trious, to which my
Heart would lead me to pay greater, or &s;incerer Acknowledge|ments. I am not
at all &s;urprized, to find, that this amazing Incident, of Integrity, is
coolly, and in&s;en&s;ibly, treated by Men of &s;lender Abilities; who have an
Affectation to &s;hine upon more pompous Subjects; who chu&s;e rather to
&s;pend their Strength in relat|ing the Fury of that Battle, and lay out all
their mi&s;taken Eloquence in rai&s;ing the Pow|ers of Hell, to pu&s;h on its
horrible Con&s;e|quences; but it is both a Matter of Surprize, and Confu&s;ion,
to think, that &s;o many truly great Poets, and Orators, &s;hould live ju&s;t
af|ter, and leave an Example, &s;o beneficial to Po&s;terity, in a manner
forgotten, for want of being commended, with that Spirit it &s;o richly
de&s;erves.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="431">PERHAPS the Hi&s;tory of the whole World, were
we to turn it never &s;o carefully over, could furni&s;h us with but few Things
more a&s;toni&s;hing, more moving, and pathetick, more exemplary, and edifying,
than this un|celebrated Pa&s;&s;age!&mdash;A Monarch to be forced, by a
prevailing Faction, to turn a Fugitive, in his own Kingdoms! And when
di&s;comfited Princes, di&s;abled Lords, and routed Armies, could no longer
a&s;&s;i&s;t their Sovereign, that it &s;hould be re&s;erved for a poor
&s;imple Hind to pre&s;erve this Lord's Anointed from a cruel, pur&s;uing
Victor, who&s;e praeternatural Swells of Fortune made him the Terror of all <HI>Chri&s;tendom!</HI>&mdash;That it &s;hould be re&s;erved for an ignorant
Country|man, to &s;ave a wi&s;e and mighty Prince from falling, like his good
Father, to be after|wards, received as our Glory, with the Ap|plau&s;es and
Acclamations, not only of our own Three Kingdoms, but all the Nations about us!
And &s;hall this <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> record|ed with Honour, by foreign
Writers, be only coldly &s;poken of by our own?&mdash;Is he a mean Man?
Con&s;ider the noble Tru&s;t, and the nobler Di&s;charge of it! and he grows
great in Proportion to the Littlene&s;s of his Condition. Is he Poor? How does
that Po|verty add to the Richne&s;s of his Virtue, who hears <HI>Praemiums</HI>
bid for the precious Life, he has in Cu&s;tody, and yet, di&s;daining the Bribe
of Gold, ventures his own for his Loyalty? Sure, nothing but a Soul, which is
abandon'd <PB N="423" REF="432"> to Barbarity and Meanne&s;s, can let a little
Idea of him take Place, upon Account of his de&s;picable Figure. It is the
noble&s;t Addition to his Greatne&s;s! As incon&s;iderable as he might be
otherwi&s;e, he mu&s;t, in this View, make a fine Picture, and he is a living
Di&s;|grace to that Herd of Titled Criminals, who follow'd the Fortunes, and
partook the im|pious Greatne&s;s, of the Pur&s;uer of Maje&s;ty. Let tho&s;e,
who look no farther than the out|&s;ide of Things, think a <HI>Plebian,</HI>
below <HI>Eulo|gy</HI>; I, who view him with other Eyes al|mo&s;t think him
above it. Had he lived in more generous Times, and been the Pre&s;er|ver of an <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> his hone&s;t Contempt of Gold, would have ju&s;tly given
him a Place equal with <HI>Camillus,</HI> in the <HI>Horatian</HI> Ode,
con&s;ecrated to the Prai&s;es of that Emperor.</P>
<P>IT is a Scene, that the Imagination can|not entertain without a
Mixture of Grief and Admiration, when we place before our Eyes that Prince in
the Habit of a Ru&s;tick, amid&s;t &s;o many different Dangers, relying upon
the Conduct and Fidelity of this <HI>real</HI> Ru&s;tick, this venerable Clown,
and his little Family for his Guards. I remember to have been informed, by a
very great Man, That 
<Q REND="inline">"He has heard the King tell the Story in Je&s;t, and
wonder'd to &s;ee many &s;mile, when his Maje&s;ty &s;aid plea&s;antly, That <HI>He He was once in danger of lo&s;ing his Guide in the Night-Time, but that
the Ru&s;tling of</HI> Richard<HI>'s Calves-Skin Breeches was a Dire|ction</HI>
<PB N="424" REF="433"> <HI>to his Ear in the Dark.</HI> The King might, indeed,
make a Je&s;t of it, &s;aid he, but I could not think of Maje&s;ty in &s;uch
Di&s;tre&s;s, without being touch'd in good Earne&s;t, by a Grief, which it was
beyond the Notion of an odd and comical Dre&s;s to remove."</Q>&mdash;I mu&s;t
&s;ay the &s;ame, as this Nobleman, with regard to the King; and even as to <HI>Pendrell,</HI> there is &s;ome|thing too &s;erious in his Integrity, not to
make us lo&s;e his Appearance, in our Venera|tion of his Virtues. As there was
a Princely Per&s;on in one rough Garb; there was a noble Soul in the other; for
when he attended the King, for the la&s;t Time, he &s;hewed, he had a true
Sen&s;e of the Weight of his Charge. For, his Maje&s;ty complaining of the
Hor&s;e, <HI>That it was the heavie&s;t Jade he ever rode on; Pendrell,</HI>
&s;milingly told him, <HI>That the Hor&s;e had the Weight of Three Kingdoms on
his Back, and ought not therefore to be blamed, if he went a little
heavily.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I Meditate the many Pa&s;&s;ages, that this little Hi&s;tory
recounts, between the King and <HI>Pendrell,</HI> my Attention is &s;o fixed to
the Parts, which exerci&s;ed this Man's Fi|delity, that I &s;carce have Room in
my Thoughts, for the Glories of a Re&s;tora|tion, that he was re&s;erved for. I
love to dwell upon this good Man: It is a familiar Example, but it is the more
u&s;eful; the Lea&s;t Man may be faithful, and Fidelity will make him Great;
while the Greate&s;t Man, with|out <PB N="425" REF="434"> Integrity, dwindles
into a Little one.&mdash;It is true, al&s;o, Integrity makes a Great Man much
Greater; &s;o it is with <HI>Ge|neral Monk,</HI> a Name, far beyond his Title.
Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> &s;trikes no Ear; calls for no Admiration. But
Every one admires the <HI>General</HI> and the <HI>Re&s;torer.</HI></P>
<P>A LITTLE gentlemanly E&s;tate was after|wards &s;ettled upon his
De&s;cendants; and had he been advanced by the Plea&s;ure of the King, from
that lowly Degree, to the No|bility, no Lord could have thought him&s;elf
injur'd, by having for his Peer, and Compa|nion, the Heir of that worthy Man,
who pre&s;erved the Fountain of Honour.</P>

<P><HI>CREDULITY</HI> is a Weakne&s;s, from which very few are exempted.
It is the Ground-work of Craft and Impo&s;ture; and the Means by which they are
propa|gated.</P>
<P>I HAVE often reflected, with Concern, upon the Condition of Humanity,
in this Regard: And nothing can be more afflicting, than to behold one Part of
the rational World making a <HI>Trade</HI> of mi&s;guiding the other! If all
the Errors, into which People are drawn, had but the Marks of <HI>Truth,</HI>
&s;ome Excu&s;e, might be found for their <HI>Cre|dulity</HI>; but the Shame
is, in their receiving what is <HI>new,</HI> at the Expence, even of <HI>Proba|bability.</HI> <PB N="427" REF="436"> Vulgar Minds are mo&s;t
&s;truck with what is mo&s;t incredible; and the Way to <HI>convince,</HI> is,
to <HI>amaze</HI> them. <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> makes few Pro&s;elytes: But <HI>My&s;tery</HI> rarely fails. And the le&s;s they know why, the fonder they
grow of the Impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>BECAUSE I would not dip into Contro|ver&s;ies, wherein <HI>Religion,</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> are concern'd; I mu&s;t de&s;cend
into Low Life, and only touch the little Artifices which owe their Reputation
to this Weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE World is wearied with Stories of <HI>Witches</HI> and <HI>Fairies,</HI> and begins to &s;ee thro' the Impo&s;ture. The Craft of <HI>A&s;trologers, Conjurers,</HI> and <HI>Prophets,</HI> begins al&s;o to be
ex|ploded, by the Vulgar, who&s;e <HI>Oracles</HI> they have long been. But I
am not a little amaz'd to find, that, in&s;tead of the Delu&s;ions, once
practis'd on the Multitude, They, now, work &s;tronge&s;t among the polite and
fa&s;hionable People. What Staring, what Clapping, what Wa&s;te of Time and
Money have <HI>Harlequin</HI> and <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> occa&s;ion'd? The
Madne&s;s, both of <HI>Actors,</HI> and <HI>Spectators,</HI> has &s;o provok'd
me almo&s;t to Tears, that I could even have <HI>wept over the City!</HI></P>
<P>I WILL not be &s;o partial, to our Wor|&s;hipful Society of FREE <HI>and</HI> ACCEPTED MASONS, as to forbear reproving them, on this Occa&s;ion,
for the unaccountable Po|ther and Noi&s;e they have lately made in the World.
What Stories have been told to amu&s;e, and engage the <HI>Credulous?</HI> What
<PB N="428" REF="437"> Reflections, what Reproach, have they brought upon That
ANCIENT ORDER, by making Pro&s;elytes, in &s;o cheap and &s;o pro&s;ti|tuted a
Manner? It afflicts me &s;en&s;ibly, when I &s;ee Coxcombs introduc'd into our <HI>Lodges,</HI> and made privy to our <HI>Secrets.</HI> I have often enter'd
my Prote&s;t again&s;t this Abu&s;e, in pri|vate Society; and mu&s;t u&s;e the
Freedom to offer this Memorial, in my publick Character. 'Tis my Opinion, That
the late Pro&s;titution of our <HI>Order</HI> is in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, the
betraying it. The weak Heads of <HI>Vintners, Drawers, Wig|makers,
Weavers,</HI> &amp;c. admitted into our <HI>Frater|nity,</HI> have not only
brought Contempt upon the In&s;titution, but do very much endanger it. And I
have heard it ask'd, Why we don't admit <HI>Women,</HI> as well as <HI>Taylors,</HI> into our <HI>Lodges?</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s I have met with
as <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> Heads among the <HI>Fair Sex,</HI> as I have found in
the BROTHERHOOD: I have &s;ome Rea&s;ons to fear, that our SECRETS are in
Danger. There is, in the Conduct of too many, &s;ince their Admi&s;&s;ion, the 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash; Caecus amor &s;ui,</L> 
<L>Et tollens vacuum plus nimio Gloria verticem;</L> 
<L>Arcanique Fides prodiga, perlucidior vitro;</L> </Q> which is
expre&s;ly prohibited by our Excellent RULES and CONSTITUTIONS; and, which is
the very Characteri&s;tick of the Fools, that were received into the LODGES at <HI>ROME,</HI> in the Days of <HI>AUGUSTUS CAESAR</HI>; <PB N="429" REF="438">
and whereof our Brother <HI>HORACE</HI> com|plain'd vehemently, in an <HI>Ode</HI> to <HI>VARUS,</HI> who was then GRAND MASTER. But whatever
Freedoms others imagine they may lawfully and di&s;creetly u&s;e, my
Con&s;cience cannot brook them.</P>

<P>MY Female Readers, and, I'm afraid, &s;ome of the <HI>Brotherhood</HI>

may not be <HI>decy|pher'd</HI> into the famous <HI>Ma&s;on Word?</HI> But I
leave the Ignorant to their <HI>Wonder</HI>; and pro|ceed to a&s;&s;ure my <HI>Brethren,</HI> that they have promoted <HI>Super&s;tition and
Babbling,</HI> contrary to the Peace of our Sovereign Lord, the King, by their
late Practices, and Conde&s;cen|tions. Alarming Reports, and Stories of
LADDERS, HALTERS, DRAWN SWORDS, and DARK ROOMS, have &s;pread Confu&s;ion and
Terror: And, if the Government does not put the Laws again&s;t us in Execution,
it will be an extraor|dinary Favour, or <HI>Over&s;ight.</HI> For my own Part,
I am &s;o faithful a Subject, and have the Weal of <HI>Our Ancient Order,</HI>

<P><HI>FAVELLUS</HI> was an eminent Preacher of the Town: Tho&s;e that
know his Character, can tell 'twas a Compound of all the good Characters
belonging to a Chri&s;tian, to a Divine, to a Gentleman. He had a mo&s;t

Acquire|ments in all &s;orts of Theological Literature. This will appear to a
Man of any Sagacity, that makes u&s;e of That and his Sermons, when
publi&s;h'd, which are now Printing by Sub&s;cription. The fir&s;t of the&s;e

incredible, <HI>All</HI> Edifying, All Enter|taining; Entertaining, I mean in

You'd be &s;ure not only to be pleas'd, but to <HI>exult</HI> in the Plea&s;ure

ingeniou&s;ly) &s;ome Truths that were uncommon, and defend|ing

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS the Opinion of me, and of many that the two Letters, I
inclo&s;e, may pa&s;s with Advantage thro' your Hands to the Publick. If too
long, abridge 'em as you think fit. I was at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> when I reciv'd
both from <HI>Maecenas,</HI> who I mu&s;t tell you, is a Gentleman of the <HI>Temple,</HI> that won't permit me to &s;ay more of him; nor need I to a
Per&s;on, of <HI>your</HI> Ta&s;te and Di&s;|cernment, that can read the Soul
of a Man in his Letters.</P>
<P>BE ju&s;t, Sir, to &s;uch a remarkable Piece of Genero&s;ity as this
of <HI>Ama&s;ius,</HI> and con|vince the World, that it is not only an
un|common <HI>Genero&s;ity,</HI> but an uncommon <HI>good Sen&s;e</HI>; a good
Sen&s;e, perhaps, which a <PB N="442" REF="451"> great many <HI>fooli&s;h</HI>
People have not a <HI>Notion of,</HI> and which a great many wi&s;e ones have <HI>only</HI> a Notion of.</P>
<P>THE like Conduct to this of <HI>Ama&s;ius,</HI> was t'other Day,
that of <HI>THEODOSIA,</HI> a Lady of an amiable Character, and of a very
con|&s;iderable Family and Fortune. She has had a long and intimate Knowledge
of <HI>Hone&s;tus,</HI> and of All his Good Qualities. She has of|ten heard,
often &s;een, what a kind Hus|band he made to his Wi&s;e, whom he has lately
lo&s;t, and with her an E&s;tate, that was all he had to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon. He
had met with many Adver&s;ities, many Trials before. But this was the
greate&s;t. He bore it man|fully; hoping, tru&s;ting, re&s;ting, firmly and
chearfully, in an Almighty Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s, and Providence. With this
Re|&s;olution, he made a friendly Vi&s;it to his Ac|quaintance in the Country;
among the re&s;t, to <HI>Theodo&s;ia,</HI> who receiv'd him kindly, and pity'd
him. He there fell ill of a Fever, during which, &s;he gave him a Thou&s;and
Proofs of her Tenderne&s;s! and, after he had recover'd, added this to the
Number of 'em, <HI>She Married him</HI>&mdash;Not without the Ad|vice of her
be&s;t Friends and Relations.&mdash;</P>
<P>THIS is the Character of <HI>Hone&s;tus</HI>; a great deal of <HI>Merit,</HI> but, withal, a great deal of <HI>Poverty,</HI> and <HI>Four
Children</HI> along with it. For <HI>this</HI> &s;he's reflected on. Cruel
World! thus to treat the generous <HI>Theodo&s;ia</HI>! And thus to treat her, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> &s;he is generous! <PB N="443" REF="452">&mdash;Cruelty
it&s;elf! But incourage her, I be&s;eech you, Sir, and let it be <HI>your</HI>
Gene|ro&s;ity to &s;ay all you can in behalf of <HI>Theo|do&s;ia</HI>'s.</P>

<P>BUT when I come to &s;peak of the <HI>Wit</HI> of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ladies, I will not do 'em the Inju&s;tice of comparing them

<P>IN a Coffee-Room, the other Day, where the Conver&s;ation turn'd on
Wit, a Gen|tleman was taking Pains to draw an odd kind of Demon&s;tration, from
the Li&s;t of Sub&s;crib|ers to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Tran&s;lation of
Homer,</HI> That there never was an Age &s;o favourable to Poets, 
<PB N="451" REF="460"> as <HI>This</HI>:&mdash;And, That, from the Num|ber of
our <HI>Noble Patrons,</HI> the Glorious Reign of King <HI>George</HI> will
&s;hine brighter to Po&s;terity than the Reign of <HI>Augu&s;tus
Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH I love Loyalty, at my Heart, and am as con&s;cious as I ought
to be of the Influences of His Maje&s;ty's Glory, yet, I confe&s;s, I was a
little &s;tartled, at the No|velty of this A&s;&s;ertion; and expre&s;s'd my
Surprize, with &s;ome Emotion.&mdash;I find then, cry'd I, that I have lived in
profound Ignorance!&mdash;As for the <HI>Politicks</HI> indeed of the pre&s;ent
Age, I have always con&s;ider'd 'em as too <HI>remarkable</HI> to be &s;oon <HI>forgot</HI>: But, for the <HI>Wit</HI> of it, I was in Hopes, there cou'd
be no Danger of its being <HI>remem|ber'd.</HI></P>
<P>IT &s;eems, continued I, the &s;evere&s;t Mi&s;ery of Men of Learning,
that Cu&s;tom has mi&s;|led them to depend, for their Encouragment, on tho&s;e <HI>Great,</HI> Little, Creatures, whom we call <HI>People of
Quality.</HI>&mdash;Were Wi&s;dom the Con&s;equence of Riches, Rank, and Power,
it had been prudent, and rea&s;onable, for Merit in Di&s;tre&s;s to apply
it&s;elf to the <HI>Mighty.</HI>&mdash;But, &s;ince the Flattery, and
Indul|gence, in which Tho&s;e called <HI>Great Men,</HI> are educated, mu&s;t
give Liberty to their <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> and Re&s;traint to their <HI>Intellects,</HI> (for Under|&s;tanding is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to Men who
can pay others, to think for them!) therefore, with due Regard to a few
&s;hining Excepti|ons, a Lord is <HI>above Wit</HI>: And mo&s;t of 'em 
<PB N="452" REF="461"> wou'd have found it more to their Ta&s;te, and their
Talent, to &s;ub&s;cribe to <HI>Heidegger,</HI> than to <HI>Homer,</HI> but
that the numerous Ac|quaintance of this fine, and happy Genius united
them&s;elves, &s;o powerfully, to recom|mend his Tran&s;lation, that, to be out
of the Li&s;t, was to be out of the <HI>Fa&s;hion:</HI> which Misfortune, no
Doubt, it was well worth <HI>Six Guineas,</HI> to be delivered from the
Di&s;grace of &mdash; But, let me &s;ee the&s;e &s;hining Names to Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s <HI>Mi&s;cellaneous Tracts,</HI> which he is now publi&s;hing
by a Sub&s;cription, &s;carce the Sixth Part &s;o chargeable, and I will
afterwards, &s;uppo&s;e, that They can <HI>read,</HI> as well as <HI>purcha&s;e.</HI>&mdash;This, however, is what I know them too well to
expect at their Hands, unle&s;s Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> &s;hall become as much <HI>The Mode</HI> as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is.</P>
<P>I WAS &s;urpriz'd to ob&s;erve, that at my Mention of Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> almo&s;t every Per&s;on pre&s;ent, join'd in a Clamour
again&s;t <HI>Criticks.</HI> They affirm'd, <HI>Thus it was but ju&s;t, to
neglect the Writings of a Per&s;on, who only writes, to cen&s;ure Others.</HI>
And, <HI>That the World &s;hou'd, without Regard to a Critick's Learning,
declare War, again&s;t his Malice; and treat, and con|&s;ider him, as a King of
Common Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>I CONTENTED my&s;elf with &s;miling, at the Extravagance of this
Rea&s;oning, and re|ply'd, That I doubted hot, however, but the Name of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> would be found a|mong Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s <HI>Sub&s;cribers</HI>; becau&s;e He has <HI>Soul</HI> to know, That though
Living Merit, <PB N="453" REF="462"> may &s;ometimes, as in his own Ca&s;e, be
po|pular, yet Popularity is &s;o far from being the <HI>Mark</HI> of Living
Merit, that Real Excellence, for the mo&s;t Part, both <HI>wants</HI> and <HI>di&s;dains</HI> it.</P>
<P>IN the Progre&s;s of my Papers, I am de|termined to examine into the
Foundation of this &s;illy Notion, <HI>That Criticks are Enemies to Wit and
Learning:</HI> And I dare be po&s;itive, before-hand, that I &s;hall di&s;cover
it to take its Ri&s;e from a Cau&s;e, of the &s;ame Nature with that, which
makes the <HI>Pickpocket</HI> hate the <HI>Hor&s;epond.</HI></P>
<P>TO pretend a Love of Learning, and at the &s;ame Time io di&s;pi&s;e
Critici&s;m, is as ri|diculous an Ab&s;urdity, as to delight in noble
Buildings, and exclaim again&s;t Architecture.&mdash;If there is not &s;ome <HI>Rule,</HI> whereby we are to mea&s;ure <HI>Wit,</HI> then Wit has no
Depen|dance on the Rea&s;on, and the Judgment; and, to be a <HI>Wit,</HI> or a <HI>Fool,</HI> are in that Ca&s;e, Terms Synonimous.&mdash;But, if Wit is to be
judg'd, by the Examination of our Rea&s;on, then that Rea&s;on is <HI>Critici&s;m</HI>: And he, who is a Critick, is the Champion of Wit, and
defends it from Prophanation.&mdash;How can he, therefore, be the <HI>Enemy,</HI> of what is &s;upported by his Influence?</P>
<P>THE true Friends of Learning ought to be cautious, how they give up <HI>Criticks</HI>; le&s;t, to free them&s;elves from a pre&s;ent Fear, they
de&s;troy their future Hope, and fall into Ob|livion, under the Growth of
a&s;&s;uming Igno|rance: <PB N="454" REF="463"> Like the Degenerate <HI>Roman</HI> Armies, who &s;lackening the Severity of their old mar|tial
Di&s;cipline, came at length, &s;ays <HI>Proco|pius,</HI> to think Helmets and
Cor&s;lets too <HI>hot</HI> for them.&mdash;They were cumber&s;ome and
in|&s;upportable:&mdash;They <HI>fainted</HI> under the <HI>Weight</HI> of
'em:&mdash;And had Courage enough, they were &s;ure, to fight, as
&s;ucce&s;sfully without 'em.&mdash;They tried it: And the Con&s;equence was,
They were never, from that Time forward, able to &s;tand, again&s;t the <HI>Arrows</HI> of the over-numbering <HI>Goths,</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI>: So
depriv'd of their Defence, they lo&s;t their Empire to <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, &s;ince no Truth operates &s;o power|fully as that which
convinces by Example, let the Good, or Ill, of Critici&s;m be decided, in fair
Combat, between the Gentleman I have nam'd above, who profe&s;&s;es, and forms
him&s;elf on it; and one of our mo&s;t rapid, and voluminous Compilers of
Poetry; who tho' one wou'd imagine him too <HI>heavy</HI> to <HI>ride
Po&s;t;</HI> yet, tru&s;ting wholly to In&s;piration, breaks over Hedges and
Ditches, and never checks his Hor&s;e's <HI>Speed,</HI> whether <HI>out</HI> of
the Road, or <HI>in</HI> it.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Merchant Adventurer</HI> was for en|gro&s;&s;ing Trade to
Him&s;elf: And began with firing the Magazines of Tho&s;e who dealt in the
&s;ame Commodity.&mdash;One of his fir&s;t <HI>witty Performances,</HI> was, A <HI>Satire again&s;t Wit.</HI>&mdash;An Accident befell me, the other Day, that
may furni&s;h him with Matter of Specu|lation. <PB N="455" REF="464"> I am very
fond of a <HI>Cat</HI>: And, ever &s;ince I lodg'd in <HI>Barbican,</HI> have
delight|ed in the Society of a Tabby Favourite of my Landlady's Children. But,
it happen'd, a few Days &s;ince, that, not being in a Hu|mour to be &s;o
familiar with her as u&s;ual, &s;he open'd one of her Claws, and was pleas'd to
&s;cratch my Leg, with no &s;mall Freedom, and Impertinence: Upon which, in
great Wrath, I took her up, by the Tail, and to&s;s'd her out of
Window.&mdash;The Cat got no Harm: but I have quite lo&s;t her Heart upon it.
And <HI>now,</HI> I may call, coax, and tempt her, as much as I plea&s;e, &s;he
keeps, always, out out of my Reach: And I dare be po&s;itive, I &s;hall never <HI>catch</HI> her, though I were to <HI>live and die in Barbican.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, to go on, with what I propos'd.&mdash;After his <HI>Satire
again&s;t Wit,</HI> he &s;et forth <HI>his Wit again&s;t Satire</HI>; and
publi&s;h'd an <HI>Epic Poem,</HI> call'd PRINCE ARTHUR.&mdash;The Excellent
Critick, abovenam'd, &s;aw, upon peru&s;ing this Piece, that the Gentleman
wanted Skill and Application, in the Art he was bent on practi&s;ing. He put
him&s;elf, there|fore, to the Trouble of compo&s;ing, for his U&s;e, a ju&s;t,
and generous Reprehen&s;ion, which he intitled, <HI>Remarks upon Prince
Arthur.</HI>&mdash;Had the Author been either humble, or wi&s;e, enough to make
Advantage by it, This wou'd have &s;erv'd him as a Plan, to build &s;tronger,
for the future; and given a Turn to his Re|flexion, that might have made him,
him <PB N="456" REF="465"> what he had &s;o earne&s;t a De&s;ire to pa&s;s
for.</P>
<P>BUT it was, then, as it is now, the Cu&s;|tom to de&s;pi&s;e a
Critick. And the Author of <HI>Prince Arthur</HI> fell, &s;o couragiou&s;ly,
into the Fa&s;hion, that in almo&s;t His Coach-Load of <HI>Epic Poems,</HI>
which he has, &s;ince oblig'd the World with, from <HI>Arthur,</HI> down to <HI>Al|fred,</HI> (I &s;peak it without Compliment) The &s;ame
di&s;tingui&s;hable Purity, Fire, Elegance, Fancy, Copiou&s;ne&s;s, and
Elevation, &s;hine, alike, in every one of 'em: And, All, are equally &s;ecure,
as well from Critici&s;m, as Imitation.</P>
<P>BUT, not content with rai&s;ing, and adorn|ing <HI>Human</HI> Nature,
He a&s;pir'd, at la&s;t, to write, upon <HI>Divinity It&s;elf.</HI>&mdash;The
Great Almighty, and His <HI>Works,</HI> were, now, to be the Subject of his
practis'd Panegyrick.&mdash;Here, &s;ure! if ever, He was to guard him&s;elf
with Caution, and put on the Critick's Armour.&mdash;<HI>Creation</HI> opened
to him, with its boundle&s;s Lu&s;tre!&mdash;Worlds beyond Worlds, were to be
di&s;cover'd, by his Poetic Tele&s;cope: And <HI>other Suns,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Light</HI> (tho' &s;wift enough, to travel a Hundred and Four&s;core
thou&s;and Miles, in one <HI>Second</HI> of Time, is notwith&s;tanding,
&s;pent, and lo&s;t, in unconceivable Immen&s;ity, before it reaches, <HI>This,</HI> our own, <HI>Sun</HI>'s Confines!) <HI>This Light</HI> was to be <HI>more Illuminated,</HI> by His Mu&s;e, and &s;hine down, upon his Reader's

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Paper of <HI>Friday</HI> the 28th. of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> is
arrived in <HI>North-Britain,</HI> and has occa&s;ioned much Speculation; but
all its Readers are &s;en&s;ibly obliged, by the <PB N="462" REF="471">
Re&s;pect you have &s;hewn our Country, and for the Honour you have done the
ri&s;ing Generation of both Sexes; and I believe, there is none here, who would
not heartily join their Acknowledgements with mine on this Occa&s;ion. I may
therefore pre&s;ume to thank you in the Name of all my Country|men, who may not
u&s;e the Freedom to write to you: But the Gentlemen of the <HI>Grote&s;que
Club,</HI> whom you have &s;o remark|ably di&s;tingui&s;h'd, mu&s;t repre&s;ent
their Sentiments, in a better Manner than I can; and I will not pretend to
&s;peak their Sen&s;e, or anticipate their Gratitude.</P>
<P>GIVE me Leave, SIR, only to expre&s;s my Mind in the Sequel. You
have brought me under &s;trong Obligations to you, by the Notice you have taken
of my Letter. And &s;ince you &s;eem to promi&s;e to your&s;elf, and the World,
&s;ome Intelligence from this Quarter, by means of my propos'd
Corre&s;pondence; I cannot but u&s;e my En|deavours, to an&s;wer, in &s;ome
Mea&s;ure, your Expectations. You have fix'd me, SIR, in the Character of your <HI>Northern Spy,</HI> and you may depend upon my mo&s;t watchful Fidelity.</P>
<P><HI>EDINBURGH</HI> being our <HI>Metropolis,</HI> and the Place of
my Re&s;idence, mu&s;t be the chief Scene of Action, and the Date of your
Intelligence from <HI>North-Britain.</HI> Here is a va&s;t Variety of Humours,
Cu|&s;toms, Manners, and Conver&s;ation, to be <PB N="463" REF="472">
con&s;idered. Many Things happen in this Place, that are worthy your Knowledge
as a PLAIN-DEALER. Some de&s;erve Prai&s;e and Admiration, others
Di&s;plea&s;ure and Reprehen&s;ion; both Regards may be u&s;e|ful, either as
Examples provoking Emula|tion; or, as Rea&s;ons, warning from Dan|ger: And
&s;ure, your Judgment, SIR, cannot err, in the Improvement and Ap|plication, of
any Accounts I &s;end you.</P>
<P>I BEG leave to lay before you, &s;everal of the Advantages, and
Di&s;advantages of our good Town, before I de&s;cend to Private Life.</P>
<P>WE are ble&s;t with an able and active <HI>Magi&s;tracy.</HI> Mo&s;t
of Tho&s;e intru&s;ted with with the Superintendency of the City, are Gentlemen
of Breeding and Letters, and all have a Bent of Mind, that favours the Publick
Grandeur and Emolument. It &s;eems to be the united Ambition of our
Magi&s;trates to adorn the Place, and by rendring it more beautiful and
commodious, to invite new Inhabitants, to increa&s;e its Trea&s;ure and
Revenue. They would &s;urmount all the Difficulties it labours under, by a
Superio|rity of Genius: And, as they appear true Friends to the Publick
Intere&s;t, in re&s;pect of <HI>Trade</HI>; they are not wanting in giving
Countenance and Encouragement to <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences.</HI>
Politene&s;s thrives under their Influence, and &s;ome of them &s;et an
Ex|ample of it to the Youth, in their own <PB N="464" REF="473"> Practice and
Behaviour. Here, SIR, are few cloudy, heavy-headed Aldermen, who&s;e Length of
Wigs and Gowns, is their &s;ole Mark of Dignity. You would take our <HI>Provo&s;ts</HI> for Fir&s;t Mini&s;ters, and our <HI>Bailies</HI> for
Courtiers. I have &s;een <HI>State&s;men,</HI> make a wor&s;e Figure than our <HI>Deacons,</HI> and heard as good Speeches in the <HI>Town-Council</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as at the Council-Board of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> I wi&s;h
all our <HI>Peers</HI> had Abilities equal to &s;ome of our <HI>Weavers,</HI>
and that every <HI>Clergyman,</HI> had half the Grace of &s;ome <HI>Bonnet-Makers</HI> of our City.</P>
<P>BUT, SIR, you know there is no <HI>Body-Politick,</HI> perfect; many
Things are wanting, to make our City more flouri&s;hing and fam'd. And,
perhaps, the greate&s;t Misfortune we labour under, is Faction and Party. This,
SIR, di&s;courages many noble Purpo&s;es, and baffles glorious Undertakings.
Self-Love, Pride and Ambition, prevail every|where, and &s;way all Men, more or
le&s;s: The&s;e are natural to all Creatures. The Olde&s;t Cock is Lord of the
Roo&s;t, and the &s;tronge&s;t Bull is <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> in his green <HI>Seraglio</HI>; the elde&s;t Buck is Tyrant of the Park, and, from his
Strength and his Horns claims a Right to be Chief in Power; and, no doubt, but
every individual Crea|ture, of every Species, with the &s;ame Force, would
&s;eek and exerci&s;e the &s;ame Juri&s;dict|ion. But Men are remarkably
di&s;tingui&s;hed, <PB N="465" REF="474"> by their Love of Precedency, and
often add, to their natural De&s;ire of Governing, a certain low-&s;pirited
Spleen and Malice. Our worthy Magi&s;trates, meet with more Oppo&s;ition and
Di&s;couragment, from little Pretenders to their Place and Authority, than from
any other Cau&s;e. If the Town-Council, beholds not <HI>Macro,</HI> with the
&s;ame Partiality, with which he con&s;iders him&s;elf, he wonders at their
Blindne&s;s, and grows <HI>peevi&s;h</HI> upon it; for the Root of the Spleen,
is often <HI>Pride di&s;appointed.</HI> Some carry it farther than mere <HI>Envy,</HI> by labouring to undermine and depo&s;e tho&s;e who are above
them, and commonly the greater the Merit is, the more obnoxious to Ill-will and
Re|proaches. As the <HI>Red Dragon</HI> pur&s;ued the Woman in the <HI>Revelation,</HI> Faction or Pri|vate Malice, pur&s;ues the mo&s;t
de&s;erving Man; and when it cannot overtake him, it opens its Mouth, and <HI>throws a Flood after him</HI>: People who have not Merit to ri&s;e
them&s;elves, would at lea&s;t level others. And what has often been my
greate&s;t Won|der, in this Ca&s;e, is, that mo&s;t of our little Jars, are
created and carried on by our <HI>Clergy.</HI> Prie&s;t-Craft is here, as <HI>Infallible</HI> as it is at <HI>Rome,</HI> and our <HI>Popes</HI> are as <HI>ab&s;o|lute,</HI> to the full Extent of their <HI>Pari&s;hes.</HI> For my
own Part, I have neither Per&s;onal Partiality for any of the pre&s;ent
Magi&s;trates, nor Prejudice again&s;t their Adver&s;aries: I never had, nor
ever needed the Favour of any <PB N="466" REF="475"> of them. I &s;peak my
Sen&s;e freely, and it is the Re&s;ult of ju&s;t Reflexion, and Ob|&s;ervation.
And I heartily wi&s;h, I had not &s;uch Ground, to expo&s;e the Spirits of any
of my Neighbours, to the <HI>Plain-Dealer.</HI> But what a Pity is it, that
Faction &s;hould deface the Publick Good? And how vile, to plot the Downfal, or
calumniate the Fame of Tho&s;e, who&s;e Power is their Coun|try's
Ble&s;&s;ing?</P>
<P>MY Concern for the Place of my Birth, has carried me farther than I
ought to have allow'd my&s;elf Liberty; but as I am not to touch this Subject
again, you will have the Goodne&s;s to excu&s;e, what I judg'd, in &s;ome
re&s;pects, to be requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>I SHOULD not neglect giving you an Account of the State of <HI>Trade</HI> in this Place nor ought I to pa&s;s over in Silence, the <HI>Univer&s;ity</HI> and <HI>College</HI> of <HI>Ju&s;tices.</HI> Many of the <HI>Clergy</HI> too, de&s;erve their Prai&s;es, and mu&s;t, upon &s;ome
Occa&s;ions, come under Con&s;ideration: But being unwilling to tire your
Patience, and huddle my Materials too much together, I will conclude this
Letter, when I have acquainted you with what the <HI>Ladies</HI> would have <HI>mo&s;t known,</HI> and what every Body here would be glad to have your
Opinion of: I mean, The FAIR ASSEMBLY. This, SIR, con&s;i&s;ts of our
be&s;t-bred Ladies, of different Qualities and Ages: 'Tis but a late
In&s;titution, and at fir&s;t, was thought to be a proper Theme 
<PB N="467" REF="476"> for our <HI>Pa&s;tors Sunday</HI> Sermons; all our
Pulpits rail'd again&s;t it, as they did, of Old, again&s;t <HI>Perukes</HI>
and <HI>Tobacco.</HI> But the holy Fire is now much &s;pent, and we are at
Liberty to meet in our great Hall, without Danger of the <HI>Kirk</HI>'s <HI>Anathema</HI>; nay, &s;ome of the Wives and Daughters of the <HI>Sanctified,</HI> begin of late, to grace our Fellow&s;hip. For my own Part,
I de&s;pair not to &s;ee the <HI>Reverend</HI> them&s;elves, eating Sweatmeats
in our Company: And mixing innocently, in our Country Dances. And I own,
notwith&s;tanding they are worthy Ladies, of undi&s;puted Virtue and Honour,
who pre&s;ide over the <HI>Fair A&s;&s;embly,</HI> I &s;hould be better
plea&s;ed to &s;ee at our Head, a <HI>Moderator</HI> from the <HI>General
One.</HI> Slander and Detraction would fly before him, and innocent Freedom,
and Chri&s;tian Commu|nion wou'd be cheri&s;hed by his Influence. Husbands
would allow their Wives to go into Company, without Jealou&s;y, and Parants
&s;end their Daughters, without fear of their leaving behind them any thing,
that they ought to bring back again. But till that <HI>Halcyon</HI> Day
arrives, we mu&s;t be contented with the want of <HI>Sanction,</HI> and dance,
and drink Tea without them. I &s;hall &s;ay more of our <HI>Fair
A&s;&s;embly</HI> hereafter, and at pre|&s;ent only &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 21. 1724.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RETURN you Thanks for the Plea&s;ure which I have received from
&s;everal of your <HI>Plain Dealers,</HI> and particularly from that which you
lately publi&s;hed concerning <HI>Detraction,</HI> which could never have
obliged the World at a more &s;ea&s;onable Juncture; becau&s;e, as you ju&s;tly
ob&s;erve, Slander was never &s;o prevailing, as 'tis at pre&s;ent, and never
&s;o in&s;upportable.</P>
<P><HI>DETRACTION,</HI> or <HI>Slander,</HI> or <HI>Calumny,</HI> call
it by what Name you plea&s;e, is, for the mo&s;t part, begot by <HI>Knaves,</HI> and nou|ri&s;h'd, and maintain'd, by <HI>Fools</HI>; and the 
<PB N="469" REF="478"> more Fools and Knaves, there are, in a Nation, the more
mu&s;t Slander flouri&s;h in it; but the more corrupt and degenerate a Nation
grows, the more Fools and Knaves mu&s;t abound in it. Now, whether this Nation
was ever &s;o corrupt and degenerate, as it is at pre&s;ent, I leave to others
to de|termine.</P>
<P>THE Fools, and Knaves, of either Sex, have a natural Aver&s;ion to <HI>Merit,</HI> and when they are neither able, nor willing, to reach a Height,
to which others, more befriended by Nature, and more beloved by Heaven, have
attained, they con&s;tantly endeavour, with all their Might, to bring the
envied Object down to their own Pitch: And, the more extraordinary the <HI>Merit</HI> is, the greater is the <HI>Envy,</HI> and the &s;tronger the
Efforts, which it makes, to blacken the De&s;erving: Which has occa&s;ioned a
famous Ob&s;erver of Mankind to &s;ay, That when|ever he <HI>hears</HI> a great
deal of <HI>Ill</HI> &s;aid of any one, and &s;ees none at all in him, he
be|gins to &s;u&s;pect, that <HI>That</HI> Per&s;on has a trouble&s;ome and
offen&s;ive <HI>Merit,</HI> which eclip&s;es that of others.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as a Knave has invented a Slander, a Fool cries out, <HI>There mu&s;t be &s;omething in it,&mdash;There is no Smoak</HI> with|out <HI>Fire</HI>: Which is as much as to &s;ay, that there can be no &s;uch Thing
as <HI>Slander</HI>; or, that no Slander can be <HI>propagated</HI>; which is
equally contrary to common Sen&s;e, and <PB N="470" REF="479"> to con&s;tant
Matter of Fact.&mdash;How different an Opinion of this Matter, had the
judicious, and penetrating, <HI>La Bruyere,</HI> who tells us, That <HI>the
Rever&s;e of what is commonly reported, concerning Per&s;ons, or Things, is
what may rea&s;onably be believ'd of either.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is another mu&s;ty Proverb, made u&s;e of in the Propagation
of <HI>Slander,</HI> which is mention'd in your la&s;t Paper, <HI>viz. That,
what Every-Body &s;ays, mu&s;t be true.</HI>&mdash;If they, who pronounce <HI>this,</HI> meant, that <HI>Every thing mu&s;t be True which has the
univer|&s;al Con&s;ent of Mankind,</HI> there might, per|haps, be &s;omething
in it; but, alas! their Meaning is va&s;tly different: They only in|fer, That <HI>when a Report, or Opinion, in any Place, &s;o far prevails, as to become,
in that Place, general, that Report, or Opinion, mu&s;t be true.</HI> So that,
in the Notion of the&s;e Gentlemen, If Calumny, at any Time, &s;o far prevails,
as to become <HI>General,</HI> 'tis no longer <HI>Calumny,</HI> but <HI>Truth</HI>; and a &s;ure Con&s;equence of this Doctrine is, That <HI>Popery</HI> is the <HI>be&s;t</HI> Religion at <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Mahometi&s;m</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, how little do they, who talk, at this Rate, know, either of the
Frailty, or Malignity, of Human Nature, or the Tran&s;actions of their own
Times, or the Records of preceding ones? Some of the be&s;t, and mo&s;t
de&s;erving Per&s;ons, both among Ancients, and Moderns, have labour'd 
<PB N="471" REF="480"> under general Calumny; under Calumnies which were not
only incon&s;i&s;tent with com|mon Sen&s;e, but were directly contradictory of
tho&s;e Virtues, and great Qualities, for which they had long been eminent, and
for which &s;ome of them have been celebrated, by <HI>Twenty &s;ucceeding
Centuries;</HI> and tho' the Truth was &s;o manife&s;tly on their Side, yet
&s;ome of the&s;e, and tho&s;e of the <HI>mo&s;t de&s;erving,</HI> have been
quite <HI>oppre&s;s'd</HI> by &s;uch Calumnies; as <HI>Socrates,</HI> and <HI>Phocion,</HI> a|mong the <HI>Graecians.</HI>&mdash;Among the <HI>Ro|mans,
Camillus,</HI> and <HI>Coriolanus.</HI>&mdash;<HI>SOCRATES,</HI> the mo&s;t
Religious, and mo&s;t Virtuous, of all the <HI>Athenians,</HI> was con|demn'd,
and excuted, as an <HI>Athei&s;t,</HI> and a <HI>Corrupter of Youth.</HI> Among
the <HI>Jews,</HI> the Prophets were <HI>&s;ton'd,</HI> and <HI>Je&s;us
Chri&s;t,</HI> Him&s;elf, was crucify'd as an <HI>Impo&s;ter,</HI> and a <HI>Bla&s;phemer.</HI></P>
<P>YOU have, very ju&s;tly ob&s;erv'd, That Detraction brings mo&s;t
Di&s;quiet, to tho&s;e who are mo&s;t above it.&mdash;You may &s;ay &s;uch
Things, without any Con&s;equence, to a worthle&s;s Fellow, as will blow a Man
of Honour into a Flame, not to be quench'd, but by Blood. But, if &s;uch
Injuries are &s;o in&s;upportable, to a Man of Honour, when they come from one
&s;ingle Per&s;on, provok'd, perhaps, by &s;ome ima|ginary Offence, and quite
frantick, with Pa&s;&s;ion, and Wine; what Impre&s;&s;ions mu&s;t they not
make, when they are whi&s;per'd <PB N="472" REF="481"> in cold Blood, by a
Number of different Per&s;ons? Such Slanders ob&s;truct the Pro|gre&s;s of
Arts, the Advancement of Learn|ing, and the Growth of Virtues, by the killing
Impre&s;&s;ions, which they make, on Individuals.&mdash;I wi&s;h you would
proceed to &s;how, what Di&s;order they bring to Families and what De&s;olation
to States. <HI>Hannibal</HI> was undone, and <HI>Carthage</HI> was ruin'd, by
the malicious <HI>Slanders</HI> of <HI>Hanno</HI>; and the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s unparallel'd Victories cou'd not defend him again&s;t
Ingratitude, while the Malice of his Slanderers met with Countenance from Men
in <HI>Power,</HI> who, being, privately, his Enemies, had not <HI>Soul</HI>
enough to &s;acrifice their <HI>little Spleen</HI> to the Love of their <HI>Country</HI>'s <HI>Glory.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P><HI>DETRACTION</HI> is an Evil, which, how|ever hateful in its Nature,
the World mu&s;t always expect to abound with. And, there|fore, &s;ince my
Corre&s;pondent has written &s;o much, and &s;o well, in Dete&s;tation of this
un|generous Weakne&s;s, all I will add, upon the Subject, &s;hall be, to
advi&s;e tho&s;e who &s;uffer under the Severity of its Con&s;equences, rather
to <HI>de&s;pi&s;e,</HI> than <HI>complain of</HI> it. To which End, they wou'd
do well to reflect on <PB N="473" REF="482"> the An&s;wer of the Philo&s;opher,
whom his Friends were urging to contrive &s;ome publick Means, whereby to
redeem him&s;elf from the Di&s;grace which he &s;uffer'd, under the Malice of
&s;ome bu&s;y Slanderers.&mdash;<HI>They who love me,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>will
give no Credit to malicious Rumours, to my Di&s;advantage: And, as for tho&s;e
who hate me, I will live, in a Manner &s;o contrary to what they believe of me,
that I will make 'em a&s;ham'd of their Credulity.</HI></P>
<P>THAT very <HI>Socrates,</HI> which my Corre&s;pond|ent &s;o ju&s;tly
produces, as one of the mo&s;t glorious of all the <HI>Victims</HI> to <HI>Slander,</HI> triumph'd over it, in the very Current and full Force, of its
Influence. For when <HI>Ari&s;tophanes,</HI> in his Comedy, call'd, The <HI>Clouds,</HI> had expos'd this great, and virtuous Sufferer, with the
utmo&s;t Bitterne&s;s of <HI>witty Malice,</HI> to the publick Spleen of the <HI>Athenians, Socrates</HI> came, in Per&s;on, to &s;ee the Comedy acted; and,
taking his Place in the mo&s;t remarkable Part of the Theatre, &s;tood up, and
expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the Ob&s;ervation of the whole Audience, told 'em,
aloud, when the Play was over, that, <HI>They had been at a merry Fea&s;t,
where He was &s;erv'd up, for their En|tertainment; nor was he angry, to have
been their &s;tanding Di&s;h, becau&s;e the Aver&s;ion which &s;ome had brought
with them, wou'd la&s;t no longer than till they had ta&s;ted him.</HI></P>
<P>SINCE it is in&s;eparable from Merit, to be expos'd to <HI>Envy,</HI>
and Envy nece&s;&s;arily produces <HI>Slander,</HI> there is no hoping to live 
<PB N="474" REF="483"> free, from the Effects of this pernicious <HI>Calumny.</HI> But, next to not feeling it the mo&s;t de&s;irable Strength
of Mind, is, <HI>Not to appear to feel it.</HI>&mdash;One of the&s;e is out of
our Reach; the other we may attain, by Force of Rea&s;on, and Re&s;olution: And
its prettily ob&s;erv'd, in <HI>Aelian,</HI> (a&s;&s;erting that Defamation
&s;inks deepe&s;t in weak Natures) <HI>The Slander of the</HI> Strong <HI>is

of Di&s;cern|ment, or want of Impartiality. In the 17th Page of the &s;mall
Edition of his Notes upon the <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> he has the&s;e Words
of the Author:</P>
<Q><HI>MILTON's</HI> chief Talent, and, indeed, his di&s;tingui&s;hing
Excellence, lies in the Sub|limity of his Thoughts. There are others of the
Moderns who rival him in every other Part of Poetry; but in the Greatne&s;s of
his Sentiments he triumphs over all the Poets, both Moderns and Antients, <HI>Homer</HI> only excepted.</Q>
<P>BUT as when a Man departs from Truth, which is the only Bond of
Union and Agreement, both of our Sentiments with tho&s;e of others, and of our
Sentiments with them&s;elves, he his ready immediately to differ from, and to
grow incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf; Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> who expre&s;ly 
<PB N="477" REF="486"> here either equals or prefers <HI>Homer,</HI> for the
Greatne&s;s of his Sentiments, before <HI>Milton,</HI> contradicts him&s;elf at
lea&s;t, no le&s;s than twice in the Cour&s;e of his Ob&s;ervations: For,
&s;ays he, in the 7th Page of the fore|&s;aid Edition, <HI>There is an
indi&s;putable and un|que&s;tioned Magnificence in every Part of</HI>
Pa|radi&s;e Lo&s;t, <HI>and, indeed, a much greater than could have been formed
upon any</HI> Pagan <HI>Sy&s;tem.</HI> Now if there is a greater Magni|ficence
in every Part of <HI>Milton</HI>'s Poem, there is by Con&s;equence a greater
Sublimity, than there is in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> which was form|ed upon a <HI>Pagan</HI> Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>AGAIN in the 92d Page of the fore&s;aid Edition, Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> &s;peaking of the Excellence of <HI>Milton</HI>'s
Performance in the Sixth Book of his Poem, delivers him|&s;elf thus:</P>
<Q><HI>MILTON's</HI> Genius, which was &s;o great in it&s;elf, and &s;o
&s;trengthened by all the Helps of Learning, appears in this Book every way
equal to his Subject, which is the mo&s;t &s;ublime that could enter into the
Thoughts of a Poet.</Q>
<P>NOW, SIR, if <HI>Milton</HI>'s Subject is the mo&s;t &s;ublime that
could enter into the Thoughts of a Poet, and his Genius is every way equal to
his Subject, it follows, That <HI>Milton</HI> is more exalted than any Poet who
has not a Subject &s;o elevated, and, con&s;equently, than <HI>Homer,</HI> or
any other Poet antient or modern.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="487"> BUT, as in the 91&s;t Page of the fore&s;aid
Comment, Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> takes a great deal of Pains to &s;hew the
Greatne&s;s of one par|ticular Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Homer,</HI> and to de&s;cribe
it, after <HI>Longinus,</HI> in all tho&s;e cho&s;en Cir|cum&s;tances, which
may make it appear to be noble and exalted, which Pains he has not taken with
any other Pa&s;&s;age, we may rea|&s;onably conclude, that he believed this to
be the mo&s;t lofty of any that are in the Works of <HI>Homer,</HI> as indeed
it really is: Now, as there is a Pa&s;&s;age in the 6th Book of <HI>Paradi&s;e
Lo&s;t,</HI> which was produced upon a parallel Occa&s;ion, let us &s;ee if we
cannot find by comparing them, for the Honour of our Country, that the
Pa&s;&s;age, of our <HI>Briton,</HI> is as much &s;uperior to that of the <HI>Grecian,</HI> as the Angels of the one are more potent than the other's
Gods, or as the <HI>Em|pyrean</HI> Heaven is more exalted than <HI>O&s;&s;a,
Pelion,</HI> or <HI>Olympus.</HI></P>
<P>IN order to this, SIR, give me leave to lay before you the Words
which Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> makes U&s;e of to &s;et &s;orth the ma&s;terly
Strokes of <HI>Homer.</HI> After he has told us, That there is no Que&s;tion,
but that <HI>Milton</HI> had heated his Imagination with the Fight of the Gods
in <HI>Homer,</HI> before he entered upon the En|gagement of the Angels (of
which, by the Way, I do not believe one Syllable: I would &s;ooner believe the
greate&s;t Ab&s;urdities of the <HI>Alcoran</HI>) he is plea&s;ed to add what
follows:</P>
<Q><PB N="479" REF="488"><HI>HOMER</HI> there gives us a Scene of Men,
Heroes, and Gods, mixed together in Battle. <HI>Mars</HI> animates the
contending Armies, and lifts up his Voice in &s;uch a Manner, that it is heard
di&s;tinctly amid&s;t all the Shouts and Confu&s;ion of the Fight. <HI>Jupiter</HI> at the &s;ame Time thunders over their Heads; while <HI>Nep|tune</HI> rai&s;es &s;uch a Tempe&s;t, that the whole Field of Battle,
and all the Tops of the Mountains, &s;hake about them. The Poet tells us, That <HI>Pluto</HI> him&s;elf, who&s;e Habitation was in the very Center of the
Earth, was &s;o affrighted at the Shock, that he leap'd from his Throne. <HI>Homer</HI> afterwards de&s;cribes <HI>Vulcan,</HI> as pouring down a Storm
of Fire upon the River <HI>Xanthus;</HI> and <HI>Minerva,</HI> as throwing a
Rock at <HI>Mars,</HI> who he tells us covered Seven Acres in his Fall.</Q>
<P>WITH the&s;e imaginary <HI>ne plus ultra's</HI> had Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> &s;o filled his Capacity, that when Ten thou&s;and greater
Beauties are be|fore his Eyes, he &s;tops &s;hort of them, and never in the
lea&s;t di&s;cerns them, as you will &s;ee immediately; for thus he goes
on:</P>
<Q>AS <HI>Homer</HI> has introduced into his Battle of the Gods every
Thing that is great and ter|rible in Nature, <HI>Milton</HI> has filled his
Fight af good and bad Angels, with all the like Cir|cum&s;tances of Horror. The
Shout of Armies, the Rattling of brazen Chariots, the Hurling of Rocks and
Mountains, the Earthquake, the Fire, <PB N="480" REF="489"> the Thunder, are
all of them imployed to lift up the Reader's Imagination, and give him a
&s;uitable Idea of &s;o great an Action. With what Art doth the Poet
repre&s;ent the whole Body of the Earth trembling, even before it was
created?</Q>
<P>THUS, with this very pretty trifling Re|mark, does Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> &s;top &s;hort, within the very Touch of one of the
va&s;te&s;t, and the &s;ublime&s;t Beauties, that ever was in|&s;pired by the
God of Ver&s;e, or by <HI>Milton</HI>'s Godlike Genius; when the very next
Lines, the very next Words, &s;trike and a&s;toni&s;h us with &s;uch wonderful
Ideas, as are able to lift up the Reader's Imagination to a Thou&s;and Times a
greater Height, than either the Shout of Armies, the Rattling of brazen
Chariots, the Hurling of Rocks and Moun|tains, the Earthquake, the Fire, or the
Thunder. But that the&s;e Beauties may be &s;een in all their Lu&s;tre, and in
all their Glory, give me leave to &s;et the whole Pa&s;&s;age before you.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Th' Arch-Angel's Trumpet through the Va&s;t of Heav'n</L> 
<L>Re&s;ounded, and the faithful Armies rung</L> 
<L>Ho&s;anna to the Highe&s;t: nor &s;tood at gaze</L> 
<L>The adver&s;e Legions, nor le&s;s hideous join'd</L> 
<L>The horrid Shock; now &s;torming Fury ro&s;e,</L> 
<L>And Clamour, &s;uch as heard in Heav'n till now</L> 
<L>Was never; Arms on Armour cla&s;hing, bray'd</L> 
<L>Horrible Di&s;cord, and the madding Wheels</L> 
<L><PB N="481" REF="490">Of brazen Chariots rag'd; Dire was the
Noi&s;e</L> 
<L>Of Conflict: Over-head the di&s;mal Hi&s;s</L> 
<L>Of fiery Darts, in flaming Vollies, flew,</L> 
<L>And, flying, vaulted either Ho&s;t with Fire.</L> 
<L>So, under fiery Cope, together ru&s;h'd</L> 
<L>Both Battles main, with ruinous A&s;&s;ault,</L> 
<L>And inextingui&s;hable Rage: All Heav'n</L> 
<L>Re&s;ounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth</L> 
<L>Had to her Center &s;hook: What Wonder! when</L> 
<L>Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought</L> 
<L>On either Side, the lea&s;t of whom could wield</L> 
<L>The&s;e Elements, and arm him with the Force</L> 
<L>Of all the Regions?</L> </Q>
<P>BUT now, Sir, if Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought on
either Side, and the very lea&s;t, the very weake&s;t of &s;o many Millions,
had Power to rend this Globe of Earth and Ocean from its Axle, and whirl it,
with its dependent Atmo|&s;phere, through the Aethereal Regions, what mu&s;t be
the unutterable, the inconceivable Effect of &s;o many Millions furiou&s;ly
con|tending again&s;t each other, and each of them exerting all his Might for
Victory? When, 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash; Each on him&s;elf relied,</L> 
<L>As only on His Arm the Moment lay</L> 
<L>Of Victory.</L> </Q></P>
<P>THESE are amazing, the&s;e are a&s;toni&s;h|ing Ideas, worthy of the
great Original Fight, the Battle of the <HI>Empyrean.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="482" REF="491"> BUT now, Sir, if the lea&s;t, if the
weake&s;t of &s;o many Millions, as fought on either Side, had Strength to
remove this Globe of Earth, with its dependent Ele|ments, what could not the
greate&s;t of them? what could not <HI>Lucifer</HI>? what could not the Prince
of the Arch-Angels, <HI>Michael</HI>'s next-to-Almighty Arm, do? The follow|ing
Lines, and our own Reflections on them may a little help to inform us.</P>
<Q> 
<L>&mdash; Long time in even Scale</L> 
<L>The Battle hung, till Satan, who, that Day,</L> 
<L>Prodigious Pow'r had &s;hewn, and met in Arms</L> 
<L>No Equal, ranging through the dire Attack</L> 
<L>Of fighting Seraphim confus'd, at length</L> 
<L>Saw where the Sword of <HI>Michael</HI> &s;mote, and fell'd</L> 
<L>Squadrons, at once.</L> </Q>
<P>BUT, now, Sir, of whom were the&s;e Squadrons? Why, 
<Q> 
<L>Squadrons of tho&s;e the lea&s;t of whom could wield</L> 
<L>The&s;e Elements, and arm him with the Force</L> 
<L>Of all their Regions.</L> </Q></P>
<P>WHAT mu&s;t the Power of that Arch-Angel be, who, with one Stroke of
his Sword, could fell whole Squadrons of tho&s;e, 
<Q> 
<L>The lea&s;t of whom could wield the&s;e Elements,</L> 
<L>And arm him with the Force of all their Regions?</L> </Q> </P>
