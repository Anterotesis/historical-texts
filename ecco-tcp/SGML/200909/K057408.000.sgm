<P>The following &s;heets are printed for the benefit of Mr.
P&s;almanazar's executrix; who thought it right to prefix his LAST WILL AND
TESTAMENT, as the be&s;t introduction to them. Mr. P&s;almanazar's fir&s;t
intimation of giving this public ac|count of him&s;elf, may be found under the
article Formo&s;a, in the COMPLETE SYSTEM OF GEOGRAPHY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 251. This work was publi&s;hed in 1747.</NOTE>, in
which he a&s;&s;i&s;ted as a writer<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mem. p.
339.</NOTE>. Where he was born, and who were his parents, do not yet appear for
certain; even in the&s;e po&s;thumous memoirs he has endeavoured to keep them
inviolable &s;ecrets. From circum&s;tances however there is little rea&s;on to
doubt, but that he was a native of France: indeed he &s;poke the French
lan|guage &s;o well, beyond what is u&s;ual when attained by grammar or travel
only, that we do not que&s;tion to &s;ay, He was a French|man. His
pronunciation had a &s;pice of the Ga&s;coin accent, and in that provincial 
<PB N="ii" REF="4"> dialect he was &s;o ma&s;terly, that none but tho&s;e born
in the country could equal, none though born there could excel him: for
notwith&s;tanding it may be e&s;teemed but a <HI>patois,</HI> or jargon, yet
foreigners find it imprac|ticable to be &s;poken with propriety, and with that
fluency and vivacity peculiar to tho&s;e people: and from this we pre&s;ume,
that &s;ome part of Languedoc may lay claim to his birth. The reverend Mr.
Villette, who was intimately acquainted with him for upwards of four and twenty
years, (and had many opportunities to ob&s;erve him, and to know him well) has
communicated the&s;e conjectures, which the judicious reader, perhaps, will
&s;ee &s;ufficiently confirmed from &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the memoirs
them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>THE LAST WILL AND TESTA|MENT OF ME A POOR SINFUL AND WORTHLESS
CREATURE COMMONLY KNOWN BY THE ASSUMED NAME OF GEORGE PSALMANAZAR</HEAD>
<P>Thy ever ble&s;&s;ed and unerring Will, Oh mo&s;t gracious, though
offended God! be done by me and all the world, whether for life or death.</P>
<P>Into thy all-merciful hands I commit my &s;oul, as unto a mo&s;t
gracious Father, who, though ju&s;tly provoked by my pa&s;t vain, and wicked
life, but more e&s;pecially &s;o during the youthful &s;allies of a ra&s;h and
unthinking part of it, has yet been gra|ciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, by thy
unde&s;erved grace and mercy, to pre&s;erve me from the reign|ing errors and
here&s;ies, and the more de|plorable apo&s;tacy and infidelity of the
pre|&s;ent age, and enabled me to take a con&s;tant <PB N="2" REF="6"> and
&s;tedfa&s;t hold on the only author of our &s;alvation, thy ever adorable and
divine Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our powerful and meritorious Redeemer, from
who&s;e alone, and all-powerful interce&s;&s;ion and merits (and not from any
the lea&s;t inherent righteou&s;ne&s;s of my own, which I heartily abhor as
filthy rags in thine all purer eyes) I hope and beg for pardon and
reconciliation, and for a happy re&s;urrection unto that ble&s;&s;ed
im|mortality to which we are redeemed by his mo&s;t precious and ine&s;timable
blood. I likewi&s;e ble&s;s and adore thy infinite good|ne&s;s for pre&s;erving
me from innumerable dangers of body and &s;oul, to which this wretched life,
but more particularly by my own youthful ra&s;hne&s;s and incon&s;ideration,
might have expo&s;ed me, had not thy Di|vine Providence interpo&s;ed in &s;uch
a won|derful manner, as ju&s;tly challenges my deepe&s;t admiration and
acknowledgment: particularly I am bound to ble&s;s thee for &s;o timely nipping
that ambition and vain|glory, which had hurried me through &s;uch &s;cenes of
impiety and hypocri&s;y, and as the mo&s;t effectual antidote again&s;t it,
next to thy divine grace, ha&s;t brought me not only <PB N="3" REF="7"> to
prefer, but to delight in a &s;tate of ob|&s;curity and lowne&s;s of
circum&s;tances, as the &s;ure&s;t harbour of peace and &s;afety; by which,
though the little I have left in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion be dwindled to &s;o
little value as to be but a poor acknowledgment for the &s;ervices which I have
received from my friend hereafter named, to whom I can do no le&s;s than
bequeath it all, yet I hope the will may be accepted for the deed, and that the
Divine Providence will &s;upply to her what is wanting in me. And now, O
Fa|ther of Mercies, I be&s;eech thee for thy dear Son's &s;ake, &s;o to direct
me by thy grace through all the future concerns of this life, that when, where,
or in what manner &s;o|ever it &s;hall plea&s;e thee to call me out of it, I
may be found ready and willing to re|turn my &s;oul, worthle&s;s as it is of
it&s;elf, to thee who gave&s;t it; and my death, as well as my latter end, may
be &s;uch as may tend all po&s;&s;ible ways to thy glory, the edification of
thy church, and my own eternal com|fort. And in hopes there is nothing in this
my la&s;t will that is not agreeable to thine, I leave it to be executed after
my death by my worthy and pious friend Sarah Re|walling, <PB N="4" REF="8"> of
this pari&s;h of St. Luke, in Mid|dle&s;ex, in the manner hereafter mentioned,
viz.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire that my body, when or where|ever I die, may be kept
&s;o long above ground, as decency or conveniency will permit, and afterwards
conveyed to the common burying-ground, and there in|terred in &s;ome ob&s;cure
corner of it, with|out any further ceremony or formality than is u&s;ed to the
bodies of the decea&s;ed pen|&s;ioners where I happen to die, and about the
&s;ame time of the day, and that the whole may be performed in the lowe&s;t and
cheape&s;t manner. And it is my ear|ne&s;t reque&s;t, that my body be not
in|clo&s;ed in any kind of coffin, but only de|cently laid in what is called a
&s;hell of the lowe&s;t value, and without lid or other co|vering which may
hinder the natural earth from covering it all around.</P>
<P>The books relating to the Univer&s;al Hi|&s;tory, and belonging to
the Proprietors, are to be returned to them according to the true li&s;t of
them, which will be found in a blue paper in my account book. All the re&s;t
being my own property, together with <PB N="5" REF="9"> all my hou&s;hold
goods, wearing apparel, and whatever money &s;hall be found due to me after my
decea&s;e, I give and bequeath to my friend Sarah Rewalling above named,
together with &s;uch manu&s;cripts as I had written at different times, and
de&s;igned to be made public, if they &s;hall be deemed worthy of it, they
con&s;i&s;ting of &s;undry e&s;|&s;ays on &s;ome difficult parts of the Old
Te&s;tament, and chiefly written for the u&s;e of a young Clergyman in the
country, and &s;o unhappily acquainted with that kind of learning, that he was
likely to become the but of his &s;ceptical pari&s;hioners, but being, by this
means, furni&s;hed with proper ma|terials, was enabled to turn the tables upon
them.</P>
<P>But the principal manu&s;cript I thought my|&s;elf in duty bound
to leave behind, is a faithful narrative of my education, and the &s;allies of
my wretched youthful years, and the various ways by which I was in &s;ome
mea&s;ure unavoidably led into the ba&s;e and &s;hameful impo&s;ture of
pa&s;&s;ing upon the world for a native of Formo&s;a, and a con|vert to
Chri&s;tianity, and backing it with a fictitious account of that i&s;land, and
of my <PB N="6" REF="10"> own travels, conver&s;ion, &amp;c. all or mo&s;t of
it hatched in my own brain, without re|gard to truth and hone&s;ty. It is true,
I have long &s;ince di&s;claimed even publicly all but the &s;hame and guilt of
that vile im|po&s;ition, yet as long as I knew there were &s;till two editions
of that &s;candalous romance remaining in England, be&s;ides the &s;everal
ver&s;ions it had abroad, I thought it incum|bent upon me to undeceive the
world, by unravelling that whole my&s;tery of iniquity in a po&s;thumous work,
which would be le&s;s liable to &s;u&s;picion, as the author would be far out
of the influence of any &s;ini&s;ter motives that might induce him to deviate
from the truth. All that I &s;hall add con|cerning it is, that it was began
above twenty-five years ago with that view, and no other, during a long
rece&s;s in the country, ac|companied with a threatening di&s;ea&s;e, and
&s;ince then continued in my mo&s;t &s;erious hours, as any thing new
pre&s;ented it&s;elf; &s;o that it hath little el&s;e to recommend it|&s;elf
but its plainne&s;s and &s;incerity, except here and there &s;ome u&s;eful
ob&s;ervations and innuendoes on tho&s;e branches of learning in which I had
been concerned, and particu|larly <PB N="7" REF="11"> with &s;uch excellent
improvements as might be made in the method of learning of Hebrew, and in the
producing a more perfect body of Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, and more an&s;werable
to its title than that which hath already pa&s;&s;ed a &s;econd edition. And
the&s;e, I thought, might be more de&s;erving a place in that narrative, as the
u&s;efulne&s;s of them would in a great mea&s;ure make amends for the &s;mall
charge of the whole. If it therefore &s;hall be judged worth printing, I
de&s;ire it may be &s;old to the highe&s;t bidder, in order to pay my arrears
for my lodgings, and to defray my funeral; and I further re|que&s;t that it be
printed in the plain and undi&s;gui&s;ed manner in which I have writ|ten it,
and without alteration or embelli&s;h|ment. I hope the whole is written in the
true, &s;incere &s;pirit of a per&s;on awakened by a miracle of mercy, unto a
deep &s;en&s;e of his folly, guilt, and danger, and is de&s;irous, above all
things, to give God the whole glory of &s;o gracious a change, and to &s;hew
the various &s;teps by which his Divine Provi|dence brought it about. The whole
of the ac|count contains fourteen pages of Preface, and <PB N="8" REF="12">
about ninety-three more of the &s;aid relation, written in my own hand with a
proper title, and will be found in the deep drawer on the right hand of my
white cabinet. How|ever, if the ob&s;curity I have lived in, dur|ing &s;uch a
&s;eries of years, &s;hould make it needle&s;s to revive a thing in all
likeli|hood &s;o long &s;ince forgot, I cannot but wi&s;h, that &s;o much of it
was publi&s;hed in &s;ome weekly paper, as might inform the world, e&s;pecially
tho&s;e who have &s;till by them the above-mentioned fabulous account of the
I&s;land of Formo&s;a, &amp;c. that I have long &s;ince owned both in
conver&s;ation and in print, that it was no other than a mere forgery of my own
devi&s;ing, a &s;candalous impo&s;ition on the puclic, and &s;uch, as I think
my&s;elf bound to beg God and the world pardon for writing, and have been long
&s;ince, as I am to this day, and &s;hall be as long as I live, heartily
&s;orry for, and a&s;hamed of.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>As the de&s;ign of my leaving the follow|ing Memoirs, is at once
to undeceive the world with re&s;pect to that vile and ro|mantic account I
formerly gave of my&s;elf, and of the i&s;land of Formo&s;a, and to make all
the amends in my power for that &s;hame|ful impo&s;ition on the public, by
leaving behind me this faithful narrative of my|&s;elf, and of the remarkable
accidents of my wretched life that led me to it, as well as of tho&s;e that
deterred me from per&s;i&s;ting in it; it will not be improper here to
pre|mi&s;e &s;ome of the chief motives that deter|mined me to write the
following &s;heets, to be printed after my death.</P>
<P>The religious education I had happily re|ceived during my tender
years, had made &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion upon my mind, that, though it
did not prove &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve me from being unwarily and gra|dually
hurried, by my own &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, <PB N="12" REF="15"> into that
&s;candalous piece of forgery; yet it never failed of making me condemn
my&s;elf, in my more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, for every
&s;tep I took towards it; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
particu|larly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the la&s;t and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> 
<PB N="13" REF="16"> care and concern for me into the ju&s;te&s;t abhorrence
and dete&s;tation of me.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e pungent reflections, which were, however, but too
often &s;mothered by various carnal con&s;iderations, and the violent hurry of
my pa&s;&s;ions, I was not without &s;ome hopes that the &s;ame divine
goodne&s;s, which had not &s;uffered me to harden into an utter
in&s;en&s;ibility of my guilt, might, in his own good time, enable me to
&s;urmount all the dreadful difficulties which my carnal mind laid in my way,
and fini&s;h that good work which my re|mor&s;e gave me cau&s;e to hope was
begun by his unde&s;erved grace in me. I was not, however, without &s;ome
apprehen&s;ions from a &s;en&s;e of my extreme guilt, le&s;t that, which I
cheri&s;hed under the notion of hope, &s;hould prove only a vain and
ill-grounded pre|&s;umption, at lea&s;t I began to fear I had rea&s;on to think
it &s;o, whil&s;t I continued inactive, and depended merely on a few faint
wi&s;hes and prayers, in&s;tead of mak|ing &s;ome &s;trong resolutions and
efforts, which might a&s;&s;ure me of the divine grace co-operating with
them.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="17">In this fluctuating and wretched uncer|tainty
I continued &s;ome years, not knowing which way to begin or go about the
ar|duous and dreaded ta&s;k, when a grievous and lingering fit of illne&s;s
did, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, hurry me to it, and made me determine immediately to
&s;et pen to paper, and employ all the time my di&s;temper would allow me, to
undo as much as was in my power all the mi&s;chief I had done, by leaving
behind me a faithful account of every thing I could recollect, and that had
been in&s;trumental to &s;o fatal and long a train of mi&s;carriages, in order
to &s;et the whole impo&s;ture in &s;o true a light, that no part of the
&s;hame may fall on the guiltle&s;s, but on the guilty; and that is chiefly on
my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;et about it accordingly, and if I did not begin &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary and laudable a work, till driven as it were to it by pain and
&s;ick|ne&s;s, by the fear of death, and of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, I hope
it will be &s;o far from le&s;&s;ening the credit of the following narra|tive,
that it will rather add weight to it, &s;eeing no time or circum&s;tances can
be <PB N="15" REF="18"> more apt to in&s;pire a man with the deepe&s;t
&s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;incerity, than tho&s;e I was in, when I wrote the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable and mortifying part of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore only add, that my di|&s;temper was a lingering
every-other-day ague, which la&s;ted me about &s;ix weeks, and that being then
in a &s;weet place of re|tirement in the country, at a very good friend's
hou&s;e, and taken &s;ufficient care of in all other re&s;pects, I had all the
time and opportunity I could wi&s;h for, joined with the propere&s;t
di&s;po&s;ition of mind for &s;uch a ta&s;k, &s;o that through God's
ble&s;&s;ing I was enabled to bring down the &s;hameful ac|count of my former
unfortunate life through the mo&s;t &s;hocking and impious &s;cenes of it, to
my arrival into England without any in|terruption, and I hope in God with that
&s;incerity and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s as &s;uch a relation could require, and my
bad &s;tate of health could in&s;pire me with, &s;till taking care be|fore all
things to implore the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the great &s;earcher of all
hearts every time I &s;at down to write, that he would direct me to go through
the arduous ta&s;k with <PB N="16" REF="19"> &s;uch a due regard to truth,
whatever &s;hame reflected on me, as might in all re&s;pects re|dound to his
glory, and entitle me to his pardon and mercy; and to him I give all the
prai&s;e, for having enabled me not only to go on &s;o far with the wi&s;hed
for work during my retreat there, but to re&s;ume it &s;ince at proper times,
till I had brought it to the de&s;ired conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>For being, &s;oon after my recovery, obliged to return to London,
and engaged in a work, which nece&s;&s;arily took up too much of my time and
thoughts, to permit me to go on with this, in the &s;ame regular manner I had
done in the country (though &s;till re&s;olved by God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance to go
through with it) I determined to &s;et apart an hour at lea&s;t every
Wedne&s;day and Friday to revi&s;e what I had wrote, and to continue the
narrative as my memory &s;erved; not doubting but the &s;olemnity of the
fa&s;t, joined to the prayers and other meditations I had appropriated for
the&s;e two days, in the method of de|votion I was through God's ble&s;&s;ing
entered into, would prove effectual means to ob|tain that &s;pirit of
&s;incerity and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s <PB N="17" REF="20"> which I earne&s;tly
wi&s;hed might go through the remainder, as I was con&s;cious it had done in
the former part, whil&s;t I laboured under my illne&s;s.</P>
<P>I went on accordingly for &s;ome time with it, till the other
bu&s;ine&s;s I had in hand, and &s;ome other avocations, as well as &s;ometimes
an indi&s;po&s;ition of the mind, unhinged me from my method oftener than I
wi&s;hed; for at &s;uch times I found my&s;elf &s;o unfit to pur&s;ue it, that
I plainly &s;aw it was better to di&s;continue it till I could recover my
for|mer frame. This occa&s;ioned &s;ometimes an intermi&s;&s;ion of two or more
weeks as to the writing part, though the matter was &s;till &s;o pre&s;&s;ing
on my mind, that it only gave me an opportunity, either of recol|lecting &s;ome
things I had omitted, or of gathering fre&s;h materials for the &s;equel.</P>
<P>But as my aim was only to give an ac|count of what either chiefly
hurried me on through &s;uch a long train of the mo&s;t un|accountable follies
and vanities, or of what brought me to a &s;en&s;e and abhorrence of them, I
have omitted a great number of the former, as rather apt to di&s;gu&s;t than
entertain or inform a &s;ober reader, and <PB N="18" REF="21"> confined
my&s;elf to the latter, as the more likely to prove in&s;tructive and u&s;eful
to him. And I &s;hall not be very &s;olicitous what judgment tho&s;e will
pa&s;s on this nar|rative, who are &s;trangers to religion and the various ways
of the Divine Providence in reclaiming &s;inners, fir&s;t by driving, and then
drawing them to him&s;elf, provided I can acquit my&s;elf to my own
con&s;cience that I have taken all po&s;&s;ible care to write it with that
&s;incerity and faithfulne&s;s that I would wi&s;h it to be done at my la&s;t
moments, and with no other view than that of mak|ing &s;uch a full and ample
acknowledgment of my great folly and guilt, as my con|&s;cience told me I ought
to do for having &s;o long and &s;o &s;hamefully impo&s;ed upon the world, as
well as of God's &s;ingular good|ne&s;s which in&s;pired me with the de&s;ign,
and hath enabled me to go through it in the manner I have done.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons of my not chu&s;ing to have it publi&s;hed during my
life, be&s;ides tho&s;e already hinted, will be &s;een in the &s;equel, and I
hope will be thought &s;olid and &s;atis|factory, e&s;pecially as it hath given
me an opportunity of continuing the latter (and <PB N="19" REF="22"> as I hope
in God) the much better part of my life, and of adding to it &s;everal u&s;eful
particulars, which the reader will find there; &s;uch as my ea&s;y and
expeditious method of &s;tudying, and attaining to a fuller knowledge of the
Hebrew tongue; &s;undry curious and in&s;tructive ob&s;ervations relating to
&s;ome of the works I have been engaged in, in the learned way, particularly in
that long and laborious one of the Uni|ver&s;al Hi&s;tory, of the de&s;ign,
beginning, and pur&s;uit, together with the difficulties, mi&s;carriages,
faults, and other matters re|lating to both editions of it; and I have been the
better able to give &s;uch an account of the whole as may be of u&s;e to the
public, e&s;pecially to the purcha&s;ers, as I have been concerned in it from
the beginning.</P>
<P>The reader will likewi&s;e find the latter part of this narrative
inter&s;per&s;ed with many other particular accidents which have hap|pily
contributed not only to keep me &s;teady in my re&s;olutions and change of
life, but which have likewi&s;e in&s;en&s;ibly led me into a more regular way
of thinking and acting; and, as true repentance begins in the change of the
heart, and ends at the reformation <PB N="20" REF="23"> of the &s;inner's life,
I may humbly hope that I have not been negligent in finding out and u&s;ing the
mo&s;t effectual helps and means, nor failed of the divine ble&s;&s;ing on
them, which are promi&s;ed to all &s;incere pe|nitents. Though the fear I was
in, le&s;t too particular an account of them &s;hould be deemed, by the
cen&s;orious, as o&s;tentatious and phari&s;aical, hath obliged me to con|ceal
a great number of them, which might perhaps have otherwi&s;e proved very
en|couraging to people in my condition; not doubting but to tho&s;e who are
&s;incere in their repentance and re&s;olutions, the &s;ame Divine Providence
will &s;uppeditate all the nece&s;&s;ary helps and directions as their ca&s;e
requires, even as it hath graciou&s;ly done to me.</P>
<P>All I would add by way of encourage|ment to per&s;ons in my
unhappy circum|&s;tances (and wor&s;e or more dangerous no man could hardly be
in than I was) is not to let the greatne&s;s of their guilt, or the
difficulties of the duties of repentance, de|ter, but rather invite him to the
throne of mercy, through the merits of our Divine Redeemer; for how dark and
gloomy &s;o|ever <PB N="21" REF="24"> the pro&s;pect of &s;o extraordinary a
change may appear at fir&s;t, as every thing doth to tho&s;e that are fled from
the broad &s;un-&s;hine into &s;ome dark place; yet tho&s;e thick and
di&s;couraging mi&s;ts will gradually di&s;appear, and every object that at
fir&s;t rai&s;ed our fears will grow more hopeful and com|fortable, when we
call to mind that there is mercy &s;ufficient in God, merits enough in
Chri&s;t, power more than &s;ufficient in the Divine Spirit, room enough in
heaven, &s;cope enough in the evangelical promi&s;es, and the mo&s;t endearing
invitations in the Go&s;pel, to bring the greate&s;t &s;inners to God of
infinite mercy and compa&s;&s;ion; &s;o that there can be thenceforth no
condemnation to them that, with faith and repentance, ap|ply to him for pardon
and grace through the merits of his ever-ble&s;&s;ed Son, and u&s;e all proper
means and helps to render him|&s;elf a fit object of it.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not however &s;uppo&s;e that the ble&s;&s;ed effects of
&s;uch a repentance will be &s;o &s;oon felt by us as we could wi&s;h, or that
the duties of &s;elf-denial, &s;elf-abhorrence, fa&s;ting, &s;olitude,
meditation, &s;elf-exami|nation, &amp;c. will become ea&s;y and delight|ful 
<PB N="22" REF="25"> as &s;oon as we are entered into a reli|gious regimen: we
mu&s;t, on the contrary, expect them to appear difficult and gloomy at the
beginning, in order to excite our faith and reliance on the Divine
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which draws us not with an irre&s;i&s;tible force, but with
the cords of men, and the bands of love (Ho&s;. xi. 4.) We mu&s;t likewi&s;e
expect to meet with frequent foils and back&s;lidings in order to make us more
dili|gent and watchful, more &s;en&s;ible of our own weakne&s;s, and more
intent on that help which comes from above. By this means, we &s;hall
likewi&s;e be happily pre&s;erved from that pride and pre&s;umption, which is
but too apt to in&s;inuate it&s;elf into the minds of new converts; for
experience plainly &s;hews, that tho&s;e two dangerous vices will be apt to
&s;pring, not only out of our &s;ins and pa&s;&s;ions, but likewi&s;e out of
our very virtues and graces, if not duly kept down, by the &s;en&s;e or
experience of our own infirmities and impotence.</P>
<P>It was an excellent caution of a pious clergyman: 
<Q REND="inline">"Don't pre&s;ume; you are not yet come to a
&s;tate of Chri&s;tian perfec|tion: don't de&s;pair; you are in the way 
<PB N="23" REF="26"> to it."</Q> So that whatever difficulties or
di&s;couragements we may meet with in our progre&s;s, how &s;hort &s;oever we
may come of our duty, or whatever frailties, or even vices we may &s;till be
prone to, which may either divert or retard our &s;peed, we may &s;till comfort
our&s;elves with the hopes, that we are in a way of growing better, and that
the u&s;e of tho&s;e means hath not only pre&s;erved us in a great mea&s;ure
from grow|ing a great deal wor&s;e, but enabled us to ri&s;e after every fall,
if it hath not &s;ometimes made even tho&s;e falls rebound to a greater heighth
of grace, by teaching us, from every &s;uch &s;tep, to tread more &s;ure for
the fu|ture; and what a comfortable pro&s;pect mu&s;t this yield to a man that
hath made any progre&s;s in this happy way, to &s;ee God's &s;trength magnified
in his own weakne&s;s, e&s;pecially when he adds thereto this bli&s;s|ful
con&s;ideration, that the &s;ame all-merito|rious blood which was &s;hed to
expiate all his wilful, if truly repented, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, will much more
effectually atone for all his involuntary defects.</P>
<P>Thus much I thought incumbent on me to &s;ay on this head,
becau&s;e whatever our <PB N="24" REF="27"> freethinkers may boa&s;t of the
&s;ufficient power of rea&s;on to reclaim a man from a long vicious cour&s;e,
from the prevalency of evil habits and con&s;titutional vices, what|ever
powerful influence they may a&s;cribe to the notion of eternal rectitude,
&amp;c. to reduce a man that hath deflected &s;o wide and far from it, without
any of tho&s;e &s;u|pernatural helps above-mentioned; yet I am well
a&s;&s;ured, that the former, without the latter, would have proved (to me at
lea&s;t, if not to any man in my condition) rather a determent than an
effectual means; for what hopes or likelihood could there be that a wretch, who
had, by his impe|tuous pa&s;&s;ion, been hurried into the com|mi&s;&s;ion of
&s;uch a &s;eries of impieties again&s;t his own rea&s;on and con&s;cience,
&s;hould ever be able to extricate him&s;elf from &s;uch a &s;la|vi&s;h &s;tate
by his own ba&s;e natural power?</P>
<P>What efficacious help could he expect from his own rea&s;oning
faculties, which, however cried up by others, he had found, by &s;ad
experience, &s;o weak and impotent, that the mo&s;t they could do for him, was
to make him condemn him&s;elf, without being able to rectify or re&s;i&s;t the
violent <PB N="25" REF="28"> impul&s;es of his predominant vice? Had, indeed,
his knowledge of mankind fur|ni&s;hed him with any remarkable in&s;tance of the
prevalency of rea&s;on above a favourite vice, it might have given him &s;ome
encou|ragement; but when he &s;ees, on the con|trary, that the&s;e &s;trenuous
de&s;pi&s;ers of all &s;upernatural helps, equally en&s;laved to &s;ome
favourite pa&s;&s;ion, and only differing from him perhaps in degree; the
mo&s;t he could expect his rea&s;on to do for him, would be to keep his own
under &s;ome re&s;traint and decorum, till time and indulgence had quite
exhau&s;ted them.</P>
<P>But what poor encouragement is this to one in my dangerous ca&s;e?
how incon&s;ider|able the change or remor&s;e? what poor &s;a|tisfaction to the
world for &s;o vile an impo|&s;ition, and what likelihood that it would procure
a pardon from an offended God, or calm the &s;tings of a wounded con&s;cience?
And how much happier was it for me that I was directed to look up for and
depend on a &s;uperior a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and in&s;tead of tru&s;t|ing to &s;uch
a broken reed of my rea&s;on and &s;trength, to apply my&s;elf to that Supreme
Being, who&s;e grace alone could work &s;uch <PB N="26" REF="29"> an
extraordinary change in the heart, give an effectual ble&s;&s;ing on my weak
efforts, and keep me &s;teady in tho&s;e re&s;olutions which he had in&s;pired
me with, as well as in the u&s;e of tho&s;e means he hath provided and
pre&s;cribed to us!</P>
<P>I gladly repeat it, that nothing le&s;s than the hopes of his
promi&s;ed grace could have induced me to endeavour after it, and no|thing but
a full reliance on the merits of a Divine Interce&s;&s;or could have invited me
to cry to him for pardon and acceptance; and, on the other hand, nothing but
the obtain|ing it could have &s;upported me under my doubts and fears, my
difficulties and di&s;|couragements, nor enabled me to per&s;evere in, and
nothing le&s;s than the continuance and increa&s;e of it could have brought a
work of &s;uch extraordinary and unde&s;erved mercy to perfection.</P>
<P>I cannot therefore but think it the greate&s;t injury that can be
done, to per&s;ons who have unhappily &s;werved from the paths of vir|tue and
religion, to make them depend &s;olely on the &s;trength of their rational
faculties for an effectual change, and to in|&s;pire them with a di&s;regard
for the more <PB N="27" REF="30"> powerful means and motives which the Go&s;pel
offers to them, and which, upon experience, will be found the only ones that
can bring it about. And may what I have here &s;aid in&s;pire every awakened
&s;inner, (who hath tried in vain the &s;ucce&s;s of the former) with the more
comfortable hope and &s;tedfa&s;t confidence, in the never-failing efficacy of
the latter.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much on the &s;ubject of the divine grace
offered to us in the Go&s;pel, it will doubtle&s;s be expected that I &s;hould
give &s;ome farther account of my private be|lief &s;o far as relates to the
controver&s;y be|tween the church of Rome, in which I was educated, and that of
England, in the com|munion of which I have lived, ever &s;ince my coming into
England. And here I mu&s;t confe&s;s, to my very great &s;hame, that though I
did for &s;everal years profe&s;s my&s;elf a zealous member of the latter, yet
the pre|judices of my education, and the general cour&s;e of my &s;tudies, did
&s;till &s;trongly in|cline me in favour of the former; in&s;omuch that neither
the many books of controver&s;y I had read on that &s;ubject, nor my frequent
di&s;putes with prie&s;ts and others of that com|munion <PB N="28" REF="31">
(in which, however, I had &s;till va|nity enough to give the preference to my
arguments again&s;t it) could fix my waver|ing mind, much le&s;s could I be
induced to think it &s;o corrupt and dangerous, antichri&s;|tian and idolatrous
as it was with &s;o much warmth maintained to be by mo&s;t prote|&s;tant
writers and preachers; in&s;omuch that this uncharitable zeal of theirs made me
&s;till more doubtful whether the rea&s;ons they urged were &s;ufficient to
ju&s;tify their &s;epara|tion from it.</P>
<P>I was indeed &s;incerely per&s;uaded, from all that I had read or
heard, that the church of England was by far the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t of all
the prote&s;tant churches; but that it was really more &s;o than that of Rome,
I was far enough from being &s;atisfied in my mind; &s;o that there was
almo&s;t as little &s;incerity in my pretended zeal for and con&s;tant
com|munion with it, than in my pretended con|ver&s;ion to it: the truth of it
is, that I was too young and heedle&s;s, vain and conceited, to lie open to
conviction, and that I read and heard the arguments on both &s;ides, rather to
fill my head than to rectify my heart, or fix my belief; &s;o that I mu&s;t
con|fe&s;s <PB N="29" REF="32"> that I acted at that time a very &s;hame|ful
and in&s;incere part, in the preference I &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly gave to the one
above the other, which, though ever &s;o ju&s;tly de|&s;erved, did not appear
then in that light to me.</P>
<P>In this carele&s;s, though impious and abo|minable, &s;u&s;pence I
continued &s;ome years (which, upon the whole, was but of a piece with the
other and more flagrant part of my impo&s;ture) till I came to read a
treati&s;e, intituled, THE CASE STATED BETWEEN A NOBLEMAN OF THE CHURCH OF
ROME, AND A GENTLEMAN OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND, in which I thought I found the
controver&s;y fully and clearly decided in favour of the latter. And I gave the
heed to the arguments on both &s;ides, not only as they appeared to me to be
&s;tated with the greate&s;t clearne&s;s and impartiality, but as I had been
long ac|quainted with Mr. Charles Le&s;ley, the re|puted author of that book,
who was uni|ver&s;ally allowed to be one of the learnede&s;t men in that
controver&s;y, and had moreover given the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of his probity
and &s;incerity, as well as of his capacity and <PB N="30" REF="33">
unbia&s;&s;ed judgment; of all which I was &s;o fully appri&s;ed, that no book
that I had read did ever contribute &s;o much, if not to fix my wavering mind,
yet at lea&s;t to make me think more &s;eriou&s;ly on the &s;ub|ject, and to
give my&s;elf up to a fre&s;h and more clo&s;e application to that
controver&s;y, and the reading of all the be&s;t authors who had, or &s;hould
afterwards write on either &s;ide; for I doubted not but we &s;hould &s;oon
hear of one or more an&s;wers from &s;ome of the be&s;t pens from that &s;ide,
again&s;t it. However, though I never could learn of any that was made to it,
it did not divert me from my purpo&s;e. And indeed I found my&s;elf &s;o
&s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of the author, that I had rea&s;on to
fear le&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion which his book had made upon my mind, &s;hould
be owing to that, rather than to the validity of his arguments, until I had
read over afre&s;h all that had been urged in favour of the oppo&s;ite &s;ide.
But here again, though I went over them with the greate&s;t attention and
&s;incerity, I found the di&s;pute &s;o &s;trangely managed, and clog|ged with
&s;uch elaborate learning and &s;o|phi&s;try, &s;uch controverted quotations
from <PB N="31" REF="34"> the Scriptures and ancient fathers, &s;uch
un|chri&s;tian charges of forgery, and perverting the &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e
authors, and other un|charitable language, as rather bewildered than convinced
my mind; &s;o that the only fruit I reaped from all my reading (be&s;ides a
&s;trong prejudice again&s;t tho&s;e of the Ro|mi&s;h &s;ide, whom I ob&s;erved
to deal mo&s;t in that unfair way of di&s;puting) was, that there could be no
&s;afety in tru&s;ting to my own judgment in a matter of &s;uch va&s;t concern;
and that it was next to impo&s;&s;ible for men, frail as we are, and warped by
our own pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices, to wade through &s;uch &s;tormy &s;eas of
controver&s;y, without an extraordinary a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the fountain of
all light and truth. I have accordingly made it my con&s;tant care ever
&s;ince, that is, for above the&s;e twenty-five years, to ap|ply my&s;elf
fervently, and to depend wholly upon that divine guide for a deliverance from
all errors of faith and practice, and for &s;uch an increa&s;e of his light and
grace as may confirm me in the belief of all his &s;aving truths, obedience to
all his commands, &s;incere communion with his holy catholic church, and a
tender and charitable concern <PB N="32" REF="35"> for all tho&s;e who have
&s;werved from it. To the&s;e petitions (which I con&s;tantly offered up to
God, not only morning and night for a long &s;eries of years, but in a more
copious and fuller form, &s;uitable to my own exi|gence, on more &s;olemn, that
is, on fa&s;t and fe&s;tival days) I hope is owing, that in|ward &s;atisfaction
which I have &s;ince been ble&s;&s;ed with, in my more &s;teady and &s;incere
communion with the church of England, and in the preference I now give it to
all other churches; and, as I hope in God, without the lea&s;t breach of
charity to any of the re&s;t. And indeed by all that I have read, or been able
to judge, I have been more and more convinced that theirs and ours are all in
an imperfect &s;tate, though &s;ome more than others, and that they are like to
con|tinue &s;o till the ri&s;ing again of the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s upon
us, who&s;e brightne&s;s will then enlighten at once both hemi&s;pheres, and
who will then not only reform what|ever is ami&s;s in his my&s;tical body, but
bring the Jews, Turks, and Heathen into it; till then we can only in charity
bewail what|ever errors we &s;ee in them, either in faith or practice, and pray
to God to reform them <PB N="33" REF="36"> in his own good time, and to be
merciful to tho&s;e who&s;e hearts are &s;incere towards him, whatever
involuntary mi&s;takes they may labour under.</P>
<P> Infallibility in the church were a ble&s;&s;ing as much to be
wi&s;hed for in this uncertain &s;tate, as it is fal&s;ely challenged by the
church of Rome; but &s;ince rea&s;on and experi|ence &s;hew it to be denied to
us, and many &s;incere members of that church do pri|vately bewail the errors
that are crept into it, though loath to own them a &s;ufficient cau&s;e for our
&s;eparation from it, it highly becomes us all to make the be&s;t u&s;e of that
guide which God hath given us, viz. his divine revealed Will and Word, without
breaking the bond of Charity with tho&s;e who interpret it in a different way
from us: for though, in that re&s;pect, we may ju&s;tly enough acknowledge in
the words of our church's confe&s;&s;ion, that 
<Q REND="inline"> "we have" all, more or le&s;s, "erred and
&s;trayed like lo&s;t &s;heep,"</Q> and that perhaps chiefly through our 
<Q REND="inline">"following too much the devices and de&s;ires of
our hearts;"</Q> yet as God is the only judge how far every man is faulty in
that re&s;pect, &s;hould we not be very <PB N="34" REF="37"> careful to pa&s;s
&s;uch a favourable judgment on them, as may entitle us to the &s;ame
in|dulgence from the judge of all hearts? Should it not at lea&s;t (&s;eeing we
are all alike fallible, and &s;tand in need of the &s;ame charitable allowance)
make us exceeding fearful how we do, by our anathemas and other unchri&s;tian
denunciations again&s;t tho&s;e that differ from us, expo&s;e our&s;elves to
the &s;ame &s;evere &s;entence, and meet with the &s;ame mea&s;ure at the
la&s;t day, as we have &s;o freely dealt unto them? This unchari|table
condemning &s;pirit, which hath &s;o long reigned among Chri&s;tians of all
denomina|tions, I have long &s;ince looked upon as the mo&s;t dangerous error a
man can fall into, as it is indeed the mo&s;t open violation of the grand
characteri&s;tic of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I have been ready to &s;hudder when I have heard &s;ome of our
preachers inveigh, in that uncharitable way, again&s;t their
Fellow-chri&s;tians, or even again&s;t our modern Free|thinkers and Dei&s;ts.
Some of them I have heard and read, who could not &s;peak or write of them
without ridicule and deri&s;ion, in&s;tead of that pity and concern which is
due to per&s;ons in that dangerous &s;tate; and, <PB N="35" REF="38"> for that
rea&s;on, have always thought them the mo&s;t unfit to teach others, who had
all the true &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity to &s;eek, and can allow them&s;elves
to exult and droll over the errors and frailties of their fellow-creatures,
which even common humanity forbids us to think of or mention without the
utmo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This uncharitable and untimely zeal, even in controver&s;ies of
the highe&s;t nature, doth &s;till more mi&s;chief in another way, by
mag|nifying and aggravating the differences be|tween the contending &s;ides,
which &s;erves only to render them the more irreconcile|able; whereas a true
chri&s;tian &s;pirit will, from a &s;en&s;e of its own infirmity, rather
chu&s;e to excu&s;e and palliate them, and will be extremely careful to
&s;often and &s;mooth every thing that is offered in the oppo&s;ition, in order
to render it le&s;s irk&s;ome and inef|fectual.</P>
<P>Had our divine Lawgiver de&s;igned that we &s;hould have all
agreed, in the main points of religion, or had he &s;een any thing &s;o
&s;inful and dangerous in our di&s;agreement about it, his infinite wi&s;dom
and goodne&s;s would, doubtle&s;s, either have given us <PB N="36" REF="39">
greater helps and brighter faculties, or would have taken care to have his
revelation made &s;o plain and obvious, that none but the wil|ful and
perver&s;e could have erred from it. In either of which ca&s;es, where would
there have been any room for that charitable and forbearing &s;pirit which is
the peculiar cha|racteri&s;tic of Chri&s;t's true di&s;ciples, and is &s;o
acceptable to him? not towards tho&s;e that agreed with us from the &s;ame
motives we agreed with them; nor yet much le&s;s to|wards tho&s;e that differ
from us, when it would have plainly appeared, that not their infirmity or
ignorance, but their pride and perve&s;ene&s;s made them do &s;o. May we not
therefore &s;afely conclude, that God &s;uf|fers us to continue in this
imperfect and uncertain &s;tate, and unavoidable diver&s;ity of opinions, in
order to give us an opportunity of exerci&s;ing a virtue, which is of all
others the mo&s;t exalted and mo&s;t acceptable to him, as being the neare&s;t
to its divine ori|ginal.</P>
<P>God, who is emphatically &s;tiled love, and hath been beyond all
po&s;&s;ible conception diffu&s;ive of it to us, hath, at the &s;ame time,
a&s;&s;ured us, that the be&s;t returns we can make <PB N="37" REF="40"> to him
for it, or he expects from us, is to make our own as exten&s;ive as we can to
all that bear his divine image: herein there|fore is this mo&s;t excellent
virtue, this cha|ritable &s;pirit di&s;played in a manner mo&s;t nearly
re&s;embling his own, when (in&s;tead of treating tho&s;e that differ from us
with contempt, &s;ourne&s;s, or impatience, which is ba&s;e and &s;elfi&s;h, or
with ill language, opprobrious names, unju&s;t reflections, cur&s;es, and
anathemas, which is truly diabolical) we think and look upon them with the
&s;ame candor, benevolence, and compa&s;|&s;ionate concern, as we &s;hould
wi&s;h to be &s;hewn to us were their ca&s;e our own; when we make the mo&s;t
charitable allow|ances for their infirmities and mi&s;takes, and are ready to
a&s;cribe their errors to the weakne&s;s of their under&s;tanding, wrong
education, or any thing rather than to the perver&s;ene&s;s of their will;
when, by our behaviour, our prayers, and good wi&s;hes, we &s;trive to convince
them that all our en|deavours to reclaim them from their errors, do really
&s;pring from our tender &s;en&s;e of their danger, and from &s;uch a &s;incere
and di&s;intere&s;ted concern for their &s;piritual wel|fare, 
<PB N="38" REF="41"> as no oppo&s;ition or ob&s;tinacy on their part &s;hall be
able to le&s;&s;en in the lea&s;t, be|cau&s;e that being a duty enjoined by
God, we cannot in any ca&s;e di&s;pen&s;e with it, without danger of incurring
his di&s;plea&s;ure; and la&s;tly, when we can, in &s;pight of all their
ob&s;tinacy or untowardne&s;s, make them &s;en&s;ible, by our words and
deportment, that we wi&s;h their happine&s;s as heartily as ever; and that,
after having tried our be&s;t efforts in vain, we heartily recommend them
&s;till to that merciful God, who&s;e equity and goodne&s;s will acquit and
approve every man who con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;eeks for, and endea|vours after
the be&s;t light, and is ready to obey it as far as he is able to ob&s;erve
it.</P>
<P>Could we once make this the aim and re|&s;ult of all our religious
differences and di&s;|putes, they would, in&s;tead of a bane, prove a &s;trong
cement and &s;upport to Chri&s;tianity; we might then differ one from another
without breach of charity, as friends love one another, though of different
tempers, complexions, &amp;c. Our unbelievers would be &s;o far from taking an
advantage from them to cry it down, that they mu&s;t be forced to admire and
e&s;teem it for the ble&s;|&s;ed <PB N="39" REF="42"> effects it produced in
mens hearts and lives, how wide &s;oever their judgments differed in other
ca&s;es; whereas, whil&s;t we make them the &s;ad occa&s;ion of faction and
&s;trife, of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and malignity, or of unrea&s;onable
impo&s;itions on the faith and practice, of &s;lander, hatred, per&s;ecution,
&amp;c. it can hardly be expected that our &s;ceptics and infidels will be
candid or ingenuous enough to perceive, or at lea&s;t to own, that all this
unchri&s;tian behaviour is diametri|cally oppo&s;ite to the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>It is indeed much to be wi&s;hed, that &s;ome of the ancient
fathers had not mingled &s;o much of this antichri&s;tian &s;pirit with their
otherwi&s;e pious and learned writings, and had not done, as the great St.
Jerome owns him&s;elf, in his epi&s;tle to Pammachius; to have done again&s;t
Jovinian, that he had le&s;s regarded what was exactly to have been urged
again&s;t him, than what might be laid as a charge again&s;t him. How much of
our now reigning &s;ceptici&s;m and infidelity may have been owing to &s;uch an
unchri&s;tian &s;pi|rit, propagated and improved as it hath been in
&s;ub&s;equent ages, and how much &s;uch uncharitable writers and preachers of 
<PB N="40" REF="43"> controver&s;y will have to an&s;wer for it at the la&s;t
day, I will not pre&s;ume to determine; but thus much I may venture to infer
from it, that tho&s;e Boanerges did chu&s;e the mo&s;t unlikely means of
recommending Chri&s;ti|anity to the unbelieving part of the world, (if &s;uch
was their real de&s;ign) when they &s;trove to propagate it in a way &s;o
diametri|cally oppo&s;ite to the meek and benevolent &s;pirit of its divine
author.</P>
<P>This &s;ingle con&s;ideration, joined to the &s;en&s;e had of the
weakne&s;s of our under&s;tanding and incapacity of judging in matters of &s;o
high a nature, hath long ago made me very careful of condemning or cen&s;uring
any church or &s;ect for holding any tenets which my con&s;cience could not
readily join in. We may indeed expo&s;e our&s;elves to a &s;e|verer judgment,
by pa&s;&s;ing too ra&s;h or un|charitable a one on others, but can never run
the &s;ame ri&s;k by the mo&s;t candid and favourable allowance we can make for
them. And, after all, what have we to do to judge tho&s;e that differ from us,
&s;ince both they and we mu&s;t &s;tand accountable to him only who is the
unerring judge of all hearts?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="44">I cannot forbear adding, that the almo&s;t
un&s;urmountable difficulties I have found to come to the bottom of the greater
part of our di&s;puted points, and the little certainty or &s;atisfaction I
have reaped from reading of mo&s;t controver&s;ies, clogged and di&s;gui&s;ed
as they are with &s;ophi&s;try and endle&s;s &s;ub|tilities, and managed with
&s;o little appear|ance of impartiality and charity, have made me &s;uch a
Pyrrhonian in polemic divinity, that I have not dared to allow my&s;elf the
liberty of cen&s;uring tho&s;e who held what I thought an error in faith or
practice, or even to pronounce it to be &s;uch, though I have been wanting in
neither zeal nor cou|rage to oppo&s;e any &s;uch on all proper occa|&s;ions,
and to give the be&s;t rea&s;on I could for my di&s;&s;enting from them; and I
much que&s;tion whether, in the imperfect and un|certain &s;tate we are in,
rea&s;on or religion will permit us, much le&s;s require of us, to proceed
farther; and whether a more po|&s;itive or categorical declaration doth not
ar|gue &s;omething wor&s;e than prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and narrowne&s;s of mind,
and will not be liable to be condemned as an unchri&s;tian warp of the
will.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="45">The tran&s;ub&s;tantiation of the church of
Rome, is a doctrine that appears the mo&s;t &s;hocking to &s;en&s;e and
rea&s;on. That of ab&s;o|lute prede&s;tination among the greater part of the
reformed churches, appears not only the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the divine
attributes of love, goodne&s;s, ju&s;tice, &amp;c. but to &s;trike at the root
of the Chri&s;tian religion, which is founded on the love of God; for how is it
po&s;&s;ible for a man to look upon &s;o ar|bitrary a being as that doctrine
repre&s;ents him, but with the utmo&s;t awe and dread, even though he was ever
&s;o fully per&s;uaded that him&s;elf was one of the prede&s;tinate? and how
much more &s;o the more he is re|moved from &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion?
Neverthe|le&s;s, as I have all po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on to believe that there are
myriads of men of learning and probity who behold tho&s;e two doc|trines in a
quite different light, and not only hold them as nece&s;&s;ary articles of
their faith, but are ready to condemn all that do not, why &s;hould I be &s;o
partial to my own judgment, as to think it more infallible than theirs, or
venture to pa&s;s the &s;ame uncharitable &s;entence on them for believing
which I blame them in my con&s;cience for <PB N="43" REF="46"> pronouncing
again&s;t me for not believing them?</P>
<P>With what ju&s;tice can I charge the former with idolatry for
wor&s;hipping what they &s;incerely believe to be the real body of our divine
and adorable Redeemer? Or how can I tax the latter with impiety for
pro|fe&s;&s;ing a doctrine, which I ought in charity to think they would abhor,
did it appear to them as derogatory of God's goodne&s;s and ju&s;tice, as it
doth to me, e&s;pecially as the belief of both is founded on their im|plicit
belief, (and con&s;equently, and at the wor&s;t, on a mi&s;taken
interpretation) of the Holy Scripture?</P>
<P>Is it not therefore more &s;afe and more chri&s;|tian for me to
content my&s;elf with giving my rea&s;ons in the &s;tronge&s;t manner I am
able, for my di&s;&s;ent from them, than to charge them, even in thought, with
wil|fully perverting the word of God, and with all the guilt and infamy of
impo&s;ing damn|able errors, under pain of damnation? It may be indeed truly
&s;aid, that this kind of retaliation is what not only reigns too much in
mo&s;t chri&s;tian churches, even to this day, but hath proved the frequent
occa&s;ion <PB N="44" REF="47"> of the mo&s;t horrid per&s;ecutions and
anti|chri&s;tian cruelties: But is it not therefore the more to be avoided and
abhorred by all true Chri&s;tians for the mi&s;chief it hath done, and is
&s;till able to do, to the Go&s;pel, and for the &s;candal it reflects on the
be&s;t religion in the world?</P>
<P>Ought it not to be a matter of the deepe&s;t grief and concern to
a good Chri&s;tian, to &s;ee the mo&s;t gracious de&s;igns of heaven to|wards
mankind thus mi&s;erably ob&s;tructed and fru&s;trated, and &s;o great a part
of man|kind deprived of the ine&s;timable benefits of it, by an untimely zeal,
the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the &s;pirit of our meek and divine Redeemer, and the
mo&s;t condemned, both by his pre|cepts and example? Doth not right rea&s;on
it&s;elf, as well as our natural &s;elf-love, tell every man how careful he
ought to be not to be mi&s;taken in a matter of &s;uch infinite concern? And
&s;uppo&s;e we have ever &s;o much rea&s;on to think tho&s;e that differ from
us are really &s;o, mu&s;t we therefore take upon us to cen&s;ure and condemn,
to anathema|tize and per&s;ecute them, whom rea&s;on and charity &s;hould
rather incline us to pity and pray for, whether their error be wilful or 
<PB N="45" REF="48"> involuntary, which can only be known to God?</P>
<P>I have cho&s;en to in&s;tance in the doctrines of
tran&s;ub&s;tantiation and prede&s;tination, as they appear the mo&s;t
&s;hocking and anti|&s;criptural to every one, except tho&s;e who believe them;
neverthele&s;s, from a &s;en&s;e of my fallibility, as well as of the
weakne&s;s of human rea&s;on, I &s;hould be very fearful of pronouncing them
ab&s;olutely fal&s;e (much le&s;s to call them anti-chri&s;tian, damnable,
&amp;c.) their appearing &s;o to me is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for my declaring
my di&s;&s;ent from them, but doth not authorize me to pro|nounce tho&s;e that
believe them to be guilty before God for &s;o doing.</P>
<P>Were I to indulge my&s;elf in the liberty of cen&s;uring or
condemning any chri&s;tian church, for any thing either in their faith or
practice, it would be that uncharitable authority they a&s;&s;ume of
condemning, as hereticks, &amp;c. all tho&s;e who cannot believe as they
do.</P>
<P>And yet I own it highly nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be, in
every particular church (&s;ince it is not given to us in this imperfect
&s;tate to be thus happily united in our belief) <PB N="46" REF="49"> a
&s;tated rule of faith, a &s;ummary of what is to be principally believed and
practi&s;ed by all its members; but then care &s;hould be taken not to multiply
tho&s;e articles be|yond what is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, nor yet to
impo&s;e them with any &s;uch damnatory clau&s;es again&s;t recu&s;ants as are
commonly u&s;ed by mo&s;t churches, to the great detri|ment and di&s;credit of
Chri&s;tianity, and the intimidating and bewildering the &s;incere and
well-meaning Chri&s;tians, who are inca|pable of judging of the merit of
tho&s;e con|trover&s;ies, and being commonly by far the mo&s;t numerous, are
entitled to a more cha|ritable and tender regard than to be obliged blindly to
believe and act as their church pre&s;cribes, or be liable to be re&s;cinded
from it.</P>
<P>Even in tho&s;e articles wherein our church is obliged to declare
its di&s;&s;ent from any of the tenets of others, methinks they might and
&s;hould in charity content them&s;elves with giving their rea&s;ons, in the
plaine&s;t and conci&s;e&s;t manner, for their di&s;&s;ent, and with &s;uch
impartial candor and tenderne&s;s as &s;hould rather in&s;pire its members with
pity and concern for, than prejudice and <PB N="47" REF="50"> hatred again&s;t,
tho&s;e that differ from them: and, above all things, they &s;hould all be
ex|ceedingly fearful of charging their antago|ni&s;ts, and their tenets, with a
greater de|gree of guilt and danger than is con&s;i&s;tent with truth, and with
that &s;pirit which con|demns and abhors all mi&s;repre&s;entation and
opprobrious language as the mo&s;t de|&s;tructive, next to ill offices or
per&s;ecution, of all errors that a Chri&s;tian can fall into.</P>
<P>It is plainly the want of this meek chri&s;tian &s;pirit, that
makes men to intermix &s;o much deadly acrimony in all their di&s;putes and
differences, as &s;erves only to de&s;troy the &s;mall &s;parks of charity that
are left among us. But where the love of Chri&s;t unites our hearts in the
bonds of peace and mu|tual benevolence, no difference in religion, however
greatly mi&s;repre&s;ented or aggra|vated by untimely zeal, will ever be able
to di&s;&s;olve the tye, or create the lea&s;t di&s;|agreement or indifference
in their affec|tions.</P>
<P>There are many things in the Greek, and Roman church, in that of
Geneva, and Aug&s;|burgh, &amp;c. which my con&s;cience will not permit me to
join with; but which I, at <PB N="48" REF="51"> the &s;ame time, firmly hope
and believe will not be laid to their charge by the merciful &s;earcher of all
hearts, who rather pities than puni&s;hes the involuntary errors of his frail
creatures: and were there none better to be found in the chri&s;tan world than
tho&s;e, I &s;hould think my&s;elf obliged to join com|munion with that which
appeared to me the free&s;t from them, rather than to &s;tand by my&s;elf, and
be deprived of the benefit of church-fellow&s;hip, provided nothing was
impo&s;ed upon me by it that my con&s;cience thought &s;inful. I look upon them
all (ex|cepting &s;uch as deny the fundamental arti|cles of Chri&s;tianity,
e&s;pecially the merits and mediation of our divine Redeemer) as &s;o many
branches of Chri&s;t's church; and tho' &s;ome are more corrupted than others,
yet all united into one body, of which he him&s;elf is the &s;upreme head and
governor, and is acknowledged by them as &s;uch.</P>
<P>However, I own that the church of Eng|land hath, in all
re&s;pects, appeared to me, ever &s;ince I have made my&s;elf more
&s;e|riou&s;ly acquainted with its faith and prac|tice, the be&s;t reformed and
free&s;t from every thing that could re&s;train me from her com|munion, 
<PB N="49" REF="52"> e&s;pecially as I am a layman: for with re&s;pect to her
clergy, I think &s;ome of the injunctions &s;he lays them under to be &s;uch as
I could by no means &s;ubmit to, and which the more con&s;cientious among them
would, I believe, be glad to be freed from, if it could be done
con&s;i&s;tently with the honour, and &s;afety of its e&s;tabli&s;hment. I am
far from intending by this to ca&s;t any blemi&s;h on the reverend order, or on
the fir&s;t reformers; but as it hath given &s;o much occa&s;ion for cavil and
di&s;re&s;pectful reflections again&s;t both, I could heartily wi&s;h to &s;ee
it effectually removed. In other re&s;pects I have long &s;ince had a va&s;t
e&s;teem and regard for her liturgy, &s;acraments, or|dination, and other
ordinances, that it hath been, and is &s;till, a matter of regret to me,
whenever bu&s;ine&s;s or any other impediment hath deprived me of the benefit
of them.</P>
<P>Her epi&s;copacy, though &s;o much di&s;re|garded by other
prote&s;tant churches, and cried down, as invalid, by that of Rome, hath long
ago been looked upon by me, not only as a &s;ingular ble&s;&s;ing, but as a
ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;tituent of a church, the divine in&s;titution of which
hath been, in my opi|nion, <PB N="50" REF="53"> as fully proved again&s;t the
former, as the validity of its ordination hath again&s;t the latter; and all I
have to wi&s;h for her &s;ake, is, that &s;he was as happy in the choice,
appointment, and promotion of her prelates; and that the Cong&egrave;s Delire
were &s;omething more than a phra&s;e without meaning: however, that needs not
to debar us, in this imperfect &s;tate, from enjoying the benefits of their
&s;acred function to very good pur|po&s;es; nor di&s;courage us from wi&s;hing
and praying for a reformation of tho&s;e abu&s;es which worldly politicians
have introduced into it.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t people indeed, who look upon the evil to lie in human
nature it&s;elf, have little hopes to &s;ee any amendment to it, till we have a
new heaven and a new earth, e&s;pecially as tho&s;e in who&s;e power the remedy
is, are mo&s;t intere&s;ted to &s;uppre&s;s it: But a good Chri&s;tian will
look higher up than tho&s;e at the helm for &s;o de&s;irable a change, &s;ince,
as I believe, we have much more rea&s;on to hope for it from the
interpo&s;ition of heaven, than any of the neighbouring churches which labour
under the &s;ame difficulties. As for tho&s;e countries abroad, which have
&s;ecula|rized <PB N="51" REF="54"> their bi&s;hopricks, &amp;c. they will
hardly charge our church with abu&s;ing hers wor&s;e than they have done
theirs; &s;o that, upon the whole, it appears in all re&s;pects to &s;tand upon
a better and more hopeful foot than any other I know, with all its
imperfections and defects.</P>
<P>I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this point without taking &s;ome notice of a
charge which &s;ome of our pre&s;ent Methodi&s;ts have laid to it, viz. its
having departed from &s;ome of its ancient doctrines, particularly tho&s;e of
prede&s;tina|tion and free-grace, or imputed righteou&s;|ne&s;s. With re&s;pect
to the former, it doth not appear that the compilers of the &s;e|venteenth
article ever de&s;igned to impo&s;e the belief of it as nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;alvation, but only to define the term of prede&s;tina|tion, as
&s;trenuou&s;ly maintained by the re|formed churches of Geneva, Switzerland,
Holland, &amp;c. leaving it to the option of every one either to a&s;&s;ent or
di&s;&s;ent from it: much le&s;s do they &s;eem to have in&s;i&s;ted upon the
belief of it in that full and exten|&s;ive &s;en&s;e (and including ab&s;olute
reproba|tion) in which the Supralap&s;arians explain it, which doctrine is now
ju&s;tly rejected by <PB N="52" REF="55"> mo&s;t divines and members of this
church. Mr. Whitefield's charge of innovation is therefore unju&s;t; and it is
well known, that he did not think otherwi&s;e of it, till he was per&s;uaded
into that opinion upon his going to preach in America: however, could it be
&s;uppo&s;ed that the fir&s;t reformers really de&s;igned it in that
&s;upralap&s;arian &s;en&s;e, I &s;hould have commended any &s;ynod who
&s;hould have &s;ince then ordered it to have been erazed, &s;eeing the truth
of a chri&s;tian doctrine is not founded on the opinion or authority of any
men, but on the evidence of Holy Writ.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the other charge, viz. in|herent and imputed
righteou&s;ne&s;s, it mu&s;t be owned, that our &s;ermons and books of devotion
&s;eem rather to run &s;o much in commendation of good works, as to lead people
to lay a greater &s;tre&s;s on the former than on the latter, and to confide
more on their good deeds than on the merits of Chri&s;t, which is certainly a
dangerous mi|&s;take, &s;ince our hope of acceptance and &s;al|vation mu&s;t be
chiefly founded upon the latter, without which our be&s;t duties could never be
acceptable from &s;uch frail and <PB N="53" REF="56"> &s;inful creatures to a
God of infinite holi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>It were therefore to be wi&s;hed, that our preachers and divines
would take &s;ome more care to caution their hearers and readers, whenever they
in&s;i&s;t on the nece&s;&s;ity of good works, again&s;t their putting their
chief de|pendence on them, and to remind them that the alone merits and
interce&s;&s;ion of our divine Redeemer can give them their &s;aving efficacy.
But though this la&s;t point is not &s;o frequently inculcated and in&s;i&s;ted
upon as could be wi&s;hed, yet that it is al|ways under&s;tood and implied, is
certain, be|cau&s;e it always was, and is &s;till acknow|ledged to be a
fundamental article of the church of England; &s;o that it is unju&s;t to
charge it with having departed from it; and yet this is the common cry of
the&s;e modern enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who are every where denouncing damnation
again&s;t all tho&s;e who in&s;i&s;t on or put any dependence on inherent
righteou&s;ne&s;s: but how unju&s;tly and fal&s;ely, let the apo&s;tle St. Paul
inform them, who expre&s;ly tells us (1 Corinth. iii. 11-15.) that &s;uch
men &s;hall be &s;aved, though with great difficulty; or, as he expre&s;&s;es
it, &s;o <PB N="54" REF="57"> as by fire, though not one of their works
&s;hould &s;tand the fiery trial; for how pre|carious &s;oever the
&s;uper&s;tructure be, whil&s;t Chri&s;t is the foundation, he cannot but be
&s;afe that builds his hopes upon it, whatever &s;traw, &s;tubble, or other
tra&s;h he may in|termix with it.</P>
<P>However, I do not doubt but this fal&s;e alarm of the Methodi&s;ts
hath proved of &s;ome u&s;e to many Chri&s;tians, as I own it hath to me, and
hath awakened them into a better and humbler opinion of their inhe|rent
righteou&s;ne&s;s, than they perhaps had before. As to my own particular, tho'
I al|ways depended &s;olely on the merits of a cru|cified Redeemer for pardon
and acceptance, and looked upon all our be&s;t &s;ervices to be de&s;titute of
the lea&s;t worth, but what they receive from him; yet I have been warned, by
this late outcry, to put le&s;s &s;tre&s;s and confidence in them, and to look
upon them rather as the evidence of our &s;incerity and &s;alvation, than as
the means or foundation of it, rather as our qualification for heaven (on which
account we may &s;afely wi&s;h, en|deavour, and pray that we may more and more
abound in them) than as things ca|pable <PB N="55" REF="58"> to give us any
title to it, which no|thing can do but the imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s of
Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus much I thought incumbent on me to declare concerning my
notions of religion in general, of the church of England in particular, and my
rea&s;on for preferring her communion to all other. I hope they are all
agreeable to the word of God, and that I have taken all po&s;&s;ible care and
pains to have them chiefly founded on that, by fre|quently reading and
con&s;ulting the &s;acred volumes in their original, and u&s;ing all pro|per
helps, as commentators, paraphra&s;ts, books of controver&s;y, &amp;c. in order
to come at their true meaning. But above all, my chief dependence hath been
upon the guid|ance and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's Holy Spirit, which, for a
great number of years, I have never failed daily to implore, as I was truly
&s;en&s;ible, how poor and in&s;ignificant all other helps would be without it,
towards the bring|ing us through the va&s;t mazes of contro|ver&s;y, which
reign all over Chri&s;tendom, to the wi&s;hed-for haven and &s;alvation, to
which I earne&s;tly pray to God to bring every &s;incere &s;oul, that longs and
&s;trives for <PB N="56" REF="59"> it. I firmly rely on the &s;ame divine
good|ne&s;s to whom I owe &s;o many mercies, and &s;o wonderful a change, that
if there be yet any thing erroneous or ami&s;s, either in my belief and
practice, he will, in his own time, and by his all-&s;ufficient light and
grace, enable me to rectify it, that I may have nothing left to do but to
acknowledge and adore his infinite and unde&s;erved mercies to me, and
particularly for having enabled me to &s;ee &s;o much of my own weakne&s;s and
in&s;ufficiency, unworthine&s;s and mi&s;ery, as to put my whole tru&s;t and
confidence in his all-powerful grace and unbounded goodne&s;s, through the
infinite merits of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer.</P>
<P>Before I conclude this Preface, it will be likewi&s;e
nece&s;&s;ary for me to give &s;ome ac|count of that va&s;t quantity of
laudanum I have been known to take for above the&s;e forty years, and my
motives for &s;o doing, in order to undeceive &s;uch per&s;ons as may have
conceived too favourable an opinion of that dangerous drug, from any thing they
may have heard me &s;ay, heard at &s;econd|hand, or may have ob&s;erved of the
&s;mall <PB N="57" REF="60"> vi&s;ible hurt I have received from it, during
&s;o long and con&s;tant a u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t of all, as to the true occa&s;ion of my taking it,
whatever pretence I may here|tofore have made for it, &s;uch as its ea&s;ing
the pain of the gout, (which di&s;temper, though I heretofore pretended to be
often troubled with, yet I never was, nor had the lea&s;t &s;ymptom or tendency
to in my con&s;ti|tution) or of its being a great help to &s;tudy, a reviver of
the &s;pirits, and the like, which qualities it in &s;ome mea&s;ure hath; yet
my motive for taking it at fir&s;t, and continuing it &s;o long, was no other
than my vanity and &s;en&s;ele&s;s affectation of &s;ingularity; and as that
was then my predominant pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o I indulged it in this and many other
&s;uch extravagant ways, at any hazard, as the following &s;heets will more
fully &s;hew.</P>
<P>Secondly, as to the quantity, though it never came up to that
va&s;t exce&s;s as I did then pretend; yet I own that I frequently took &s;uch
large do&s;es, by way of o&s;tenta|tion, as mu&s;t have proved detrimental, if
not quite fatal, to any man that had had a le&s;s &s;trong and happy
con&s;titution than I was ble&s;&s;ed with; and I have been very 
<PB N="58" REF="61"> often &s;urpri&s;ed to find that I received &s;o little
prejudice from it. And this it was that emboldened me to take &s;uch large and
dangerous draughts of it, without the lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ity or motive for it,
but to be taken notice and talked of; in&s;omuch that I con|tinued it during
&s;uch a number of years, that I was become a perfect &s;lave to, and could not
be ea&s;y without it, tho' I had for &s;ome time been &s;en&s;ible of the ill
con&s;equences attending the con&s;tant u&s;e of it, e&s;pecially as often as I
indulged my vanity with a larger do&s;e than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Thirdly, As to my vain pretence of having found an effectual way
of &s;tripping the opium of all its pernicious qualities, though it was true in
part, and I had fallen upon a preparation of it (which was a kind of &s;afe and
u&s;eful improvement on that which Dr. Jones gives us in his MYSTERY OF OPIUM)
by the help of &s;ome acids, particularly the juice of Seville oranges, which,
mixed with &s;ome alcalies, rai&s;ed a kind of ferment in the infu&s;ion, by
which &s;ome of the mo&s;t vi&s;cous and narcotic parts were either &s;cum|med
off, or made to &s;ub&s;ide; yet &s;o far was it from being &s;o inoffen&s;ive
and benefi|cial, <PB N="59" REF="62"> as I gave it out, that I had frequent
occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve &s;ome of its ill effects in tho&s;e whom I
unadvi&s;edly per&s;uaded to u&s;e it in &s;ome proper ca&s;es, as I thought,
&s;o that I was obliged to leave off pre&s;cribing it to others; though, as to
my&s;elf, I was a long while before I found any inconvenience in taking it,
even in that large quantity; and I have great rea&s;on &s;till to think it
le&s;s dangerous by far than either that of Dr. Sydenham's, or any infu&s;ion
exhibited by the apothecaries and common di&s;pen|&s;aries.</P>
<P>However, when I began to feel the incon|venient effects of it,
which was not till a good number of years u&s;ing it, I thought it high time to
le&s;&s;en the u&s;ual do&s;e (which was then about ten or twelve tea
&s;poonfuls morning and night, and very often more) as fa&s;t as I conveniently
could, and in about &s;ix month's time had reduced my&s;elf to half an ounce
per day, and &s;omewhat weaker than the common Sydenham. I &s;till conti|nued
decrea&s;ing; but &s;uch was my fooli&s;h vanity, that, to conceal my
reduction, I added &s;ome other bitter tincture, e&s;pecially that of
hierapicra, or &s;ome other &s;uch corrective, <PB N="60" REF="63"> among it,
to appear as &s;till taking my u&s;ual quantity.</P>
<P>On the other hand, I found that this re|duction, gradual as it
was, could not be continued without &s;ome affecting and di&s;|couraging
inconveniences; &s;uch as a great la&s;&s;itude and unea&s;ine&s;s of the mind,
an in|dolence and incapacity for &s;tudy, a di&s;like to every thing I read or
wrote, to &s;olitude and application; all which made me apprehen|&s;ive, that
if I did not &s;lacken it, and go more warily on with it, I might bring
my&s;elf into a greater evil than that which I endeavoured to &s;hun, and fling
my&s;elf at length into a kind of habitual torpor and inactivity, which might
prove at lea&s;t as detrimental to me: to prevent which, I was forced to take a
new method, and to inlarge or le&s;&s;en my do&s;e, according to the &s;tate of
health I was in, &s;ometimes according as the weather was more or le&s;s
enlivening, or according as the cour&s;e of my &s;tudies required a greater or
le&s;&s;er degree of application. All this, how|ever, was rather owing to my
own natural indolence and want of re&s;olution to go on in &s;pight of all
tho&s;e inconveniences, than to any danger there really was in the 
<PB N="61" REF="64"> ca&s;e, as I happily found rea&s;on afterwards to think;
for when the Divine Providence was plea&s;ed to ble&s;s me with a contrary turn
of mind, and to make me dete&s;t and abhor all my former follies, and this
among the re&s;t, to &s;uch a degree, as to re&s;olve, by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
upon a thorough change, I then found both the ta&s;k, and all the
inconve|niences attending it, to grow more and more ea&s;y; and as this
re&s;olution was founded upon a much better principle than my former ones were,
&s;o it was attended with &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing at my la&s;t &s;tay at Oxford,
anno &mdash; from July to the latter end of September, by which time I had made
a con&s;iderable pro|gre&s;s in my reduction, that I had quite com|pleted the
conque&s;t, and lived &s;ome weeks there without taking one drop, or even
wi&s;hing for it, although neither then nor &s;ince was I without &s;ome
employment which required a pretty clo&s;e application.</P>
<P>In this plea&s;ing &s;tate, as I ju&s;tly thought it, I continued
for &s;ome months, when the &s;everity of the en&s;uing winter overturned all
my mea&s;ures, and forced me, though much again&s;t my will, to have recour&s;e
to it again: neither could I think of any &s;afer or <PB N="62" REF="65"> more
effectual remedy again&s;t that chilne&s;s of my blood, and lowne&s;s of
&s;pirits, which I laboured under through the exce&s;&s;ive cold|ne&s;s of the
&s;ea&s;on. I re&s;olved, however, to re&s;ume it in the &s;malle&s;t quantity
that I could find would an&s;wer my end; that is, what was, as near as I could
judge, equiva|lent to ten or twelve drops of Sydenham's, and with full
intention to leave it off as &s;oon as the warm weather returned, and had
ac|cordingly reduced my&s;elf to about half that quantity, though not without
&s;ome diffi|culty, on account of a work I was &s;till en|gaged in, and the
nece&s;&s;ity we were under to keep time with the printers and publi&s;hers.
Finding it at length &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and plea&s;ant, as well as &s;afe and
harmle&s;s, I re&s;olved to continue it, and have done &s;o to this pre|&s;ent
time; that is, for &s;even or eight years, without the lea&s;t inconvenience
from it. On the contrary, I have rea&s;on to think that even that &s;mall
quantity, though &s;carce equi|valent to twelve drops of Sydenham's, hath been
of &s;ome &s;ervice to me to prevent that decay of &s;pirits which old age,
(being now drawing near my &s;eventieth) a &s;edentary life, and clo&s;e
&s;tudy, might otherwi&s;e proba|bly <PB N="63" REF="66"> have brought upon me:
and it is to this &s;mall do&s;e, which I take every night in a pint of very
&s;mall punch, as &s;oon as I leave off writing, that I attribute, next to the
ble&s;&s;ing of God, that good &s;hare of health I have hitherto enjoyed, and
my having been able, for &s;o many years, to go through the fatigues and
applications of &s;tudy, from &s;even in the morning to &s;even at night,
pre|&s;erving &s;till a good appetite and dige&s;tion, a clear head, and
tolerable flow of &s;pirits, and enjoying a &s;ound &s;leep of &s;ix or &s;even
hours, without indulging my&s;elf in any other li|quors than tea all the day,
and the above|mentioned quantity of punch, or &s;omething equivalent to it at
night; and as I have not opportunity for much exerci&s;e, I take care to live
on the plaine&s;t diet at noon, and to ob&s;erve the old adage at night,

<HEAD>MEMOIRS, OF GEORGE PSALMANAZAR.</HEAD>
<P>I cannot better begin this melancholy ac|count of my former life,
vile and abo|minable as it hath been, and blended with &s;uch mixture of the
mo&s;t unaccountable pride, folly, and &s;tupid villainy, in oppo|&s;ition to
rea&s;on, religion, and all checks of con&s;cience, till almo&s;t to the
thirtieth year of my age, than by humbly acknowledging the infinite mercy of
God, not only in pre|&s;erving me &s;o long from the many evils and
di&s;a&s;ters which my own wicked ra&s;h|ne&s;s mu&s;t el&s;e unavoidably have
precipitated me into, as the &s;equel will &s;ufficiently &s;how; but much more
&s;o in that gradual and vi|&s;ible change which his grace wrought in me, by
enabling me frequently to retro|&s;pect with &s;hame and remor&s;e on a life
&s;o ba&s;ely &s;pent, to &s;end up the mo&s;t fervent wi&s;hes to heaven that
I might at length break off from &s;o &s;hameful and wicked a cour&s;e of the
vile&s;t and mo&s;t &s;candalous <PB N="66" REF="68"> impo&s;ture, that a wild
and abandoned youth could be guilty of, and that I might but be ble&s;&s;ed
with &s;uch a &s;teady re&s;olution as at once publickly to di&s;claim all the
lies and forgeries I had formerly publi&s;hed in that mon&s;trous romance, and
at any rate or risk to take the &s;hame to my &s;elf, and make a free
confe&s;&s;ion of the whole impo&s;ture. But I had not only my pride to combat,
but the di&s;plea&s;ure which &s;uch a declaration would give to all my
friends, who being very hone&s;t and religi|ous, could not but have taken it
much at heart, and, perhaps, been expo&s;ed to the cen&s;ure of the world for
their charitable opinion of me; to &s;ay nothing of the ab|horrence they mu&s;t
have conceived-again&s;t &s;o dete&s;table a cheat. As the&s;e therefore were
&s;uch powerful determents to a man wholly de&s;titute of any laudable way of
living, I could not expect that my earne&s;t wi&s;hes would be &s;peedily
an&s;wered; and my only hope was, that the &s;ame gracious God, who had thus
effectually awaked me to a &s;en&s;e of my guilt and danger, would al&s;o in
his own time hear tho&s;e prayers which him&s;elf had in&s;pired me to make, 
<PB N="67" REF="69"> e&s;pecially, as upon a retro&s;pection of my pa&s;t
follies, I was apt to comfort my&s;elf with the thoughts, that the violence of
my favourite pa&s;&s;ion, pride, could never have hurried me &s;o
irre&s;i&s;tibly through &s;uch &s;cenes of folly and danger, if there had not
been &s;ome &s;ad flaw in my under&s;tand|ing, &s;ome unavoidable degree of
madne&s;s in my temper, which might in &s;ome mea|&s;ure extenuate, if not
wholly excu&s;e, the atrocious guilt it had involved me in; and the hope that
it might &s;till be placed to that account, by a merciful Judge of all our
thoughts and intents, of our frail and corrupt nature, joined to the
&s;tedfa&s;t con|fidence I had in the promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel, and in the
infinite merits of a divine Saviour, pre&s;erved me from de|&s;pairing of mercy
and pardon, of &s;ucce&s;s and ble&s;&s;ing on tho&s;e happy beginnings, if
clo&s;ely and earne&s;tly pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>But as &s;uch a hope, without a &s;incere de&s;ire of doing one's
part, to the be&s;t of one's power, and according to the degree of
a&s;|&s;i&s;tance given from above, would rather de&s;erve the name of ra&s;h
and &s;hameful pre|&s;umption; <PB N="68" REF="70"> &s;o the next &s;tep I
took, at lea&s;t in view, was to &s;et about making all po&s;&s;i|ble
reparation to God and his church, and to the world, and my own con&s;ci|ence,
for the &s;candal which &s;uch a vile piece of hypocri&s;y mu&s;t have given to
all, e&s;pecially to good men, and in &s;pite of all reluctance from pride and
&s;elf-love, which the greater it was, would the more natu|rally lead one to
the throne of mercy for a proportionable &s;upply of Divine grace, and
patiently to wait for it in God's own proper time. I had not continued many
months in this hopeful di&s;po&s;ition, before I perceived all tho&s;e
difficulties and di&s;|couragements to vani&s;h by degrees, but more
e&s;pecially at the approach of a &s;e|vere di&s;ea&s;e, though lingering, and
the apprehen&s;ions of death, which la&s;t, as it did not appear to be &s;o
near at hand, gave me room to hope I might have time &s;ufficient granted me in
mercy, to go through this faithful narrative, and unde|ceive the world; &s;o
that if the Divine Providence did think fit to drive me to the writing of it by
his afflicting hand, I hope it will rather add weight to the cre|dit 
<PB N="69" REF="71"> of it, &s;eeing no time is fitter than this to in&s;pire a
man with the deepe&s;t &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s and &s;incerity. But as to me, I
&s;till more rely on the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that &s;pirit of truth, to who&s;e
&s;pecial grace I am bound to a&s;cribe the abhorring &s;en&s;e I had al|ready
conceived again&s;t my former guilt, as well as the earne&s;t de&s;ire and
re&s;olution of tran&s;mitting to the world &s;uch an ac|count of my pa&s;t
guilty life, as might wholly contradict and explode that fal&s;e and impious
one, which I had been induced to publi&s;h in the days of my abominable folly
and vanity. Under that Divine Guide therefore I &s;et my&s;elf immediately
about it, and carried on daily, and with as much application as my di&s;ea&s;e
(a very violent ague and fever) would permit, not doubt|ing but the &s;incerity
which I re&s;olved, by God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;hould reign through the
whole, would make &s;ome amends for the lowne&s;s of &s;tile, and other
imperfections, which, con&s;idering my weakly condition both of mind and body,
were in &s;ome mea&s;ure unavoidable. Thus far I thought nece&s;&s;ary to
appri&s;e the reader concerning the (happy, I hope I have rea&s;on to call 
<PB N="70" REF="72"> it) occa&s;ion of my writing the following account, which
in the name, and under the direction of that &s;ame God of truth, I now hope to
live to &s;ee fini&s;hed, in or|der to be printed, if thought worthy of it,
after my death; and I &s;hall only add, that I am at this pre&s;ent time of
writing (April 22, 1728) at a friend's hou&s;e in the coun|try, free from all
&s;tudy and bu&s;ine&s;s, or any other impediment, but what is cau&s;ed by my
di&s;temper, and &s;hall dedicate all the time I have to &s;pare in the writing
of it.</P>
<P>But here I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed from giving an account
either of my real country or family, or any thing that might ca&s;t a
reflection upon either, it being but too common, though unju&s;t, to cen&s;ure
them for the crimes of private per&s;ons, for which rea&s;on I think my&s;elf
obliged, out of re&s;pect to them, to conceal both. Out of Europe I was not
born, nor educated, nor ever travelled; but continued in &s;ome of the
&s;outhern parts of it till about the &s;ix|teenth year of my age, when
nece&s;&s;ity obliged me in &s;ome mea&s;ure to remove into more northern ones,
though never farther northward than the Rhine in Germany, <PB N="71" REF="73">
or York&s;hire in England. And this I pur|po&s;ely mention, becau&s;e I have
been here|tofore &s;u&s;pected to be a German, Swede or Dane by &s;ome; by
others, an Engli&s;h or Scotchman, as their fancy lead them, though I never
&s;aw Germany till I was &s;ixteen, nor England till about two or three years
after. As for my parents and relations they were Roman Catholics, and mo&s;t of
them very zealous in their way, and &s;trongly bia&s;&s;ed again&s;t all
Prote&s;tants. My father was of an ancient, but decayed family, and had been
obliged to leave my mother before I was five years old, and to live near five
hundred miles from her, whil&s;t &s;he was left to live and breed me up upon
her &s;mall fortune, without re|ceiving any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him, his
mi&s;|fortunes having put it quite out of his power to contribute any thing;
&s;o that I was wholly left to her care. However, nei|ther that, nor the
narrowne&s;s of her cir|cum&s;tances, hindered her from giving me the be&s;t
education &s;he could, being then her only &s;urviving child. She was a pious
good woman in her way, and though I was no &s;mall favourite of hers, was yet 
<PB N="72" REF="74"> kept with due &s;trictne&s;s whil&s;t I &s;taid with her,
which was however but a &s;hort time, and do not remember that I had then any
the lea&s;t vicious inclination, nor in all like|lihood might have had, had I
&s;till conti|nued under her wing; whereas through the mi&s;management of
tho&s;e fir&s;t per&s;ons to who&s;e tuition I was next committed, &s;uch a
wrong foundation was laid, and &s;o &s;trong a bia&s;s given me to vanity and
&s;elf-conceit, as proved the unhappy &s;ource of all my &s;ad mi&s;carriages
&s;ince.</P>
<P>One general remark here I cannot avoid making concerning the
&s;chools of the Roman Catholics, viz. that all their &s;tudents mu&s;t learn
to read, and even pray, in Latin, before they are capable of under&s;tanding
one word of it; for this doth but inure them to read and pray without any
atten|tion, even when they are afterwards capa|ble of under&s;tanding what they
read and pray for. This ill-timed method had been complained of by many a one
who have &s;ince felt the &s;ad effects of it, as well as the almo&s;t
in&s;urmountable difficulty of ma&s;tering a defect &s;o early contracted and
&s;o deeply rooted, as it were, in our nature, <PB N="73" REF="75"> and none
hath had more rea&s;on to bewail it than I.</P>
<P>But what did me in particular the mo&s;t hurt, in my education
abroad, was the great admiration which my more than com|mon readine&s;s at
learning whatever came in my way had gained me, and the im|prudent fondne&s;s
and partiality which my ma&s;ters &s;hewed to me on that account. I was hardly
turned of &s;ix years when I was &s;ent to a free-&s;chool taught by two
Franci&s;|can monks, the elde&s;t of whom perceiving my uncommon genius for
languages, for till then I had only learned to read all &s;orts of print and
writings, and was be&s;ides very carele&s;s about writing a tolerable hand,
took it into his head to put me to the Latin form, though my mother and all my
friends thought me much too young for it, e&s;pecially as I was to be ranked
and cla&s;&s;ed among other boys of twice my years, and who had already been at
it a year or two, and &s;ome more; however he depended &s;o much on his
judgment, about my genius and application, that he doubted not, he &s;aid, but
to &s;ee me out-top all the re&s;t in le&s;s than a year or two.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76">He was not mi&s;taken, and though it put me to
great difficulties and hard &s;tudy to reach them, I began to feel &s;uch
emotions of vanity at the quick progre&s;s I made, and the commendations he
gave me upon it, that I re&s;ted not &s;atisfied till I had gained the fir&s;t
rank in the form, as well as in his affection, for as he &s;pared nei|ther
care&s;&s;es nor encouragement to me, I &s;oon became &s;en&s;ible both by his
behaviour, as well as by the deference which the other boys paid to me, how
much I was got in his favour.</P>
<P>Our &s;chool was often vi&s;ited by prie&s;ts, monks, gentlemen,
and other per&s;ons that pa&s;&s;ed through our city, and though we had in it
&s;everal boys who&s;e parents were in a much higher &s;tation, yet I was
al|ways &s;ingled out as the flower of the flock, and as the mo&s;t ready to
an&s;wer &s;uch que&s;tions as were &s;uitable to our form. Our monk had
likewi&s;e, by way of animating us, cau&s;ed &s;ome curious nicknacks to be
made by the nuns of a neighbouring mo|na&s;tery, which they were to wear
hanging to their button-holes, by a fine ribon, who held the fir&s;t &s;eats.
The&s;e were of &s;everal <PB N="75" REF="77"> &s;izes, and one of them much
larger than the re&s;t was for the foremo&s;t in rank. We were to be entitled
to the&s;e accord|ing to our merit, and this la&s;t fell to my lot from the
fir&s;t exerci&s;e, and &s;o proud was I become of this bauble, that I ne|ver
lo&s;t it for one &s;ingle day; for I had &s;uch a ready and retentive memory,
and quick apprehen&s;ion, as by the help of a moderate application, made it
impo&s;&s;ible for my &s;chool-fellows to wre&s;t it from me. This mark of
di&s;tinction did moreover en|title me to be head monitor and mar&s;hal of that
whole &s;chool. All which filled me with &s;uch vanity and ambition to excel,
that I could not brook any &s;uperiority or preference, and our monk was but
too fond of indulging, and even encouraging me in it, though to my no &s;mall
detri|ment, as he might ea&s;ily perceive that it had given me &s;uch a
&s;trong bias to pride, as a prudent man would have rather cho&s;en to nip in
the bud, e&s;pecially as he ea&s;ily perceived that it created no &s;mall envy
in my &s;chool-fellows, and a kind of di&s;&s;atisfaction in &s;ome of their
parents and relations.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78">He tried once indeed to thwart his par|tiality
to me, by giving our form a new kind of exerci&s;e, the price of which to the
be&s;t performer was to be a fine piece of nun's work, which he adjudged to
an|other, whom all the &s;chool knew to be a dunce, but in point of quality the
head of us all. Had he given it to &s;ome others of our form, who were greater
proficients in learning, I might have thought they had &s;ucceeded better in
their performance than I at that time; and though it would have been a great
mortification to me, it might have only made me double my diligence; but here
the preference was &s;o flagrant and vi&s;ible, that I could not forbear
expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to know wherein he had outdone me, and a
&s;u&s;picion that he had been a&s;|&s;i&s;ted underhand by &s;ome monk or
&s;ome|body el&s;e. When the good father found that I took the matter &s;o to
heart, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, threaten to bid adieu, if not to the Latin, at
lea&s;t to his &s;chool; (and I believe I &s;hould really have done it, &s;o
highly I re&s;ented what I called the in|ju&s;tice done me) he thought fit to
pacify me by a&s;&s;uring me, that my competitor <PB N="77" REF="79"> had, upon
this occa&s;ion, &s;o far excelled him&s;elf, that he could not forbear
a&s;&s;ign|ing him the prize by way of encourage|ment, though my performance
was far enough from being inferior to his; and &s;o, to put an end to the
contention, immedi|ately &s;ent for another piece of the &s;ame curious work,
and gave it to me, not with|out &s;ome great encomium on my uncom|mon diligence
and progre&s;s, and other to|kens of his &s;ingular regard, which &s;ent me
home &s;o &s;atisfied and full of my&s;elf, that, alas for me! every thing
&s;eemed to contri|bute to &s;well my growing pride, and make me forget
my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Many other &s;uch in&s;tances of his partial fondne&s;s I could
name, which all tended to make me &s;till more a&s;&s;uming and arro|gant; one
however I cannot pa&s;s by, which &s;hall &s;erve as a &s;pecimen: as I never
was guilty of a fault at &s;chool, &s;o let me do what I would out of it, I was
never pu|ni&s;hed for it, as the other boys were, but had, perhaps, a &s;oft
reprimand or &s;ome ea&s;y ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned me by way of penance, for I
cannot call to mind that I ever had a blow or cro&s;s word from him. One day 
<PB N="78" REF="80"> in particular, &s;ome &s;trangers, who vi&s;ited us after
dinner, obtained us a di&s;charge for the re&s;t of the day. We were no
&s;ooner got out but I told my &s;chool-fellows, that we ought to go and
procure the &s;ame re|lea&s;e to the girls of another &s;chool. Ac|cordingly we
went and broke into the hou&s;e, and drove the mi&s;tre&s;s and &s;cho|lars
out, and then locked the doors, that they might not be obliged to come in
a|gain, and &s;ent her the key at night. On the next day a &s;evere complaint
was brought again&s;t us for the a&s;&s;ault, and I charged as the ringleader
of the re&s;t, upon which a &s;uitable puni&s;hment was promi&s;ed, and &s;oon
after put in execution, in which I not only expected to have a &s;hare, but to
be the fir&s;t called down to it, and yet by what partial motive I know not, I
had no other puni&s;hment than a &s;eeming &s;evere reprimand, and &s;ome
ea&s;y task, whil&s;t all the re&s;t were forced to &s;ubmit to the
di|&s;cipline of the &s;chool. This partiality they loudly complained of, not
only to him, but to their friends; but their re&s;entment upon it only gave me
new matter for triumph, as it did to them new cau&s;e for envy, 
<PB N="79" REF="81"> which yet they dared not vent in any other way than
words.</P>
<P>Thus I went on learning of Latin apace, I could tran&s;late out of
it, write and &s;peak it with great readine&s;s, as far as I had been taught,
which was thought &s;urpri&s;ing, con|&s;idering I had hardly attained my ninth
year, and been but two years under his care. The misfortune was, that he made
us only conver&s;ant with common &s;chool-books, and but with few of any of the
old cla&s;&s;ics either in pro&s;e or ver&s;e, &s;o that I was quite
unacquainted with their &s;tile till I came into better hands, as I &s;oon
after did; for our good father being &s;hortly af|ter cho&s;en head, or, as
they &s;tile it, guardian of another convent, about twenty-four miles from
this, and in an archiepi&s;|copal city, where was al&s;o a college of Je&s;uits
for the education of youth, he ea|&s;ily prevailed upon my mother to let me go
with him thither, and to board at the mona&s;tery under his eye, whil&s;t I
went on with my &s;tudies at the college, where he al&s;o promi&s;ed to
recommend me to the care of tho&s;e fathers. He likewi&s;e promi&s;ed her that
he would, in the evening, make <PB N="80" REF="82"> me repeat and explain what
I had learned in the day, and by that means pu&s;h me &s;o forward in my
learning that I &s;hould out-top all my age, all which proved &s;uch powerful
per&s;ua&s;ives to my mother, that &s;he ea&s;ily agreed to it, e&s;pecially as
he took four or five more youths with him to be on the &s;ame foot with me both
at the college and in the convent. We &s;et out accordingly with him for the
place, and when I was introduced into the Je|&s;uits college, there was no
&s;mall &s;trife what cla&s;s I &s;hould be admitted into at fir&s;t. Here it
will be nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint the reader that the Je&s;uits di&s;tingui&s;h
their forms, or, as they more properly &s;tile them, cla&s;&s;es, each of them
being kept in a &s;e|parate apartment, as follows, viz. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The vith, or lowe&s;t, where they begin to learn the
Latin Grammar.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 2. vth, where they perfect them&s;elves in that, and begin
to learn &s;ome Latin books, and to make &s;ome wretched Latin.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 3. ivth, where they read Tacitus, Cicero's Epi&s;tles,
Ovid, and &s;ome other ea&s;y Ro|man <PB N="81" REF="83"> authors, and begin to
make better Latin.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 4. iiid, where they read Curtius, Cicero's &s;peeches,
Virgil, and make pretty good Latin, and learn to make Latin ver&s;es. They
likewi&s;e begin here to learn the Greek Grammar.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 5. Humanity. In this cla&s;s they read Ho|race, Cicero,
Terence, make good ver&s;es, and compo&s;e &s;ome &s;et &s;peeches on a
&s;ubject given, and if they have a genius for it, make &s;ome con&s;iderable
progre&s;s in the Greek tongue, though they only read ho|milies of the fathers,
and make ver&s;ions out of Latin into Greek. They likewi&s;e make &s;ome &s;et
&s;peeches, or poetical works, before a full audience.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 6. Rhetoric. Here Homer and other Greek poets,
Demo&s;thenes and other Greek authors, are read; together with Cicero de
Oratore, Horace's Satyres, and de Arte poetica. Themes are compo&s;ed on given
&s;ubjects, as much as can be, in the Ciceronian &s;tile and method; and
likewi&s;e poems in imitation of the Greek and Latin poets, and other books,
compiled by &s;ome of the &s;ociety for the u&s;e of this cla&s;s, as 
<PB N="82" REF="84"> there are others for every cla&s;s el&s;e, and every
branch of learning that is taught in them, the greate&s;t part of which is to
be learned by heart by the &s;cholars, as well as &s;everal other per&s;ons,
out of the cla&s;&s;ic authors, in order to exerci&s;e their memory, as is
pretended, but rather &s;erves to clog it with a deal of unintelligible
&s;tuff, which being &s;ooner forgot than learned, &s;erves to little
purpo&s;e, except it be to take up &s;o much of their time, to the neglect of
more u&s;eful things, and more adapted to their capacities; to which I may
&s;afely add another great inconveni|ency, viz. that the&s;e le&s;&s;ons being
to be repeated to the decurions or monitors, be|fore the regent comes in, and
an account to be given to him who hath, or who hath not learned them duely, in
order to be commended or reproved, both the &s;cholar and the monitor are in
&s;uch ha&s;te to go through the drudgery, that tho&s;e are mo&s;t approved of
who can repeat theirs with the greate&s;t &s;peed, or rather with
precipi|tation, by which &s;uch an habit is formed of &s;peaking and reading
with &s;uch mon|&s;trous quickne&s;s, as will require a great 
<PB N="83" REF="85"> deal of trouble and pains, to break one's &s;elf off
afterwards, if ever it is really rec|tified, and this I found long &s;ince to
my lo&s;s, and no &s;mall grief.</ITEM>
<ITEM> 7. The la&s;t is philo&s;ophy, which they di|vide into
logic, phy&s;ics, metaphy&s;ics, and morality, each of which takes them a
quarter of a year in learning, or, at lea&s;t, in expounding. Every &s;cholar
is obliged to &s;pend a year at lea&s;t in each of the cla&s;&s;es; and if, at
the year's end, when they are all to be &s;eparately examined, any be found
tardy, either through dul|ne&s;s or negligence, they are condemned to go
through the &s;ame &s;tudies another year, whil&s;t the re&s;t, who are found
worthy, are promoted to the next cla&s;s in rank.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>When I came therefore to be acquainted with the particular
&s;tudies and books of each cla&s;s, and came to reflect on my be|ing &s;uch a
&s;tranger to the cla&s;&s;ics, I begged of my old ma&s;ter that I might be
offered only as candidate for the third cla&s;s, where they began to be taught,
and this I &s;hould have looked upon as a favour, con&s;idering that it was
then Mid&s;ummer, and that I <PB N="84" REF="86"> was herded as a beginner into
a cla&s;s where the re&s;t had already &s;tudied &s;ix months; &s;o that I
thought I &s;hould have &s;till enough to do to overtake them before the year
was out. But the good father would by no means agree to it, but in&s;i&s;ted
upon my being examined as a candidate to huma|nity. This, I complained, was
putting a double hard&s;hip upon me, being an utter &s;tranger to the every
author that was read in this as well as in the other below it, and having, at
mo&s;t, but &s;even months to ma&s;ter them all; he &s;o far engaged, though
a|gain&s;t my will, for my overcoming all tho&s;e difficulties by my genius and
application, that I was obliged to undergo the exami|nation of a candidate for
humanity: and though my repugnance made me le&s;s &s;oli|citous how I went
through it, as I was &s;o de&s;irous to be &s;ent down to the cla&s;s be|low
it, yet whether the old monk's inte|re&s;t prevailed, or my own merit gained
it, I was readily admitted into the cla&s;s of humanity, and found it a very
hard tug to keep up my credit under tho&s;e di&s;ad|vantages I laboured under.
I wondered indeed how my old ma&s;ter could be guilty <PB N="85" REF="87"> of
&s;uch a neglect, and often pre&s;&s;ed him to give me his a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
which he trying to comply with, gave me but too fair an opportunity of
di&s;covering the true cau&s;e of it, viz. his being as unacquainted with them
as I was. This therefore proved a very difficult cla&s;s to me; and what was
&s;till more di&s;couraging to me was, that our regent, &s;o they call the
per&s;on that teaches in every cla&s;s, in&s;tead of making any kind allowance
for my tender years, for my being entered &s;o late, and under &s;uch
di&s;advantages, often charged me with neglect and indolence, and, in a
joco&s;e manner, threatened to leave me <HI>inter ma|nentes,</HI> that is,
in&s;tead of rai&s;ing to the next cla&s;s, to leave me in this for another
year. And though I was &s;en&s;ible that would have been more for my advantage,
yet the &s;hame of it was what I could not have brooked; and I thought it a
mortification more than &s;ufficient to be ranked among the middle|mo&s;t of
his cla&s;s, who had till then been u&s;ed to be at the head. But this he did
rather to &s;pur me on than to di&s;pirit me, that I might the more ea&s;ily be
admitted into the cla&s;s of rhetoric again&s;t the time <PB N="86" REF="88">
of the yearly examination. This grand ceremony is performed a little before the
Chri&s;tmas holidays, and when the &s;cholars have learned their doom, that is,
whe|ther to go up or to &s;tay in the old cla&s;s, they break up for ten or
twelve days, and go to their re&s;pective homes. There were at this time four
or five of my own town&s;|boys, all of them not only much older, but who had
been at the college &s;everal years before me, and bore a kind of envy
again&s;t me for being admitted at once into the &s;ame cla&s;s with them, and
would have been glad to have left me behind in it. This con&s;ideration, joined
to the di&s;plea|&s;ure &s;uch a piece of news would have been, not only to my
old ma&s;ter, but much more &s;o to my mother, made me &s;o much the more
diligent again&s;t the time of trial, and the more ea&s;ily forego the
advantage of another year's humanity: for the pride and plea&s;ure of keeping
pace with, and following them into rhetoric. Accordingly, I exerted my&s;elf
&s;o well, and gave &s;uch &s;atisfaction at my examina|tion, that I was
nominated, as well as they, for that higher cla&s;s. But tho' this 
<PB N="87" REF="89"> gave me no &s;mall joy, and made me go home with a lighter
heart, yet I have had &s;ince &s;ufficient rea&s;on to wi&s;h it had proved
otherwi&s;e; for our next regent, (the Je|&s;uits cu&s;toms is to change them
every year, and to &s;end new ones out of other colleges) proved a per&s;on
every way almo&s;t unquali|fied for that high cla&s;s, &s;o that we rather went
backwards than forward under him. He e&s;&s;ayed at fir&s;t to expound &s;ome
of the Greek poets and orators by the help of the Latin ver&s;ions annexed to
them, in doing which he &s;o far betrayed his igno|rance of that tongue, that
every one of us &s;oon became &s;en&s;ible of it, which obliged him to &s;et it
quite a&s;ide. He was not much happier in the Latin ones, though better
acquainted with them, and took at length &s;uch a di&s;gu&s;t to the college
method, that he may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to have diverted him&s;elf with teaching
us things quite op|po&s;ite to it, and altogether foreign to our cla&s;s, but
which &s;uited his genius better.</P>
<P>It will not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve here, that the three main
qualifications that procure admi&s;&s;ion into that &s;ociety, are quality, or
high rank, learning and riches. Our good <PB N="88" REF="90"> regent was one of
the la&s;t &s;ort, being the &s;on of an overgrown citizen or trade&s;|man, who
brought money enough into the fraternity to make amends for his want of
learning; and as this college was but an ob&s;cure one, in compari&s;on to
tho&s;e which they have in their great univer&s;ities, he might be thought
perhaps good enough to teach here; at lea&s;t, if he was not fit to do &s;o
here, he could be much le&s;s &s;o any where el&s;e. He complied however &s;o
far with the rules of the college, and of our cla&s;s, as to oblige us now and
then to make ver&s;es, themes, ver&s;ions, and &s;uch low ex|erci&s;es; but I
&s;oon found that he did not give him&s;elf the trouble of looking them over,
or even, for form's &s;ake, of com|mending or di&s;commending our perform|ances
according to their merit. As he was of a facetious temper, he would often &s;o
far indulge his vein, as to entertain us for a whole hour with &s;tories, which
were nei|ther calculated to improve our minds, nor to make us in love with our
books. At length, quite tired, as he &s;eemed, with the drudgery of the
college, he took it into his head to teach us heraldry, geography, and 
<PB N="89" REF="91"> fortification, in&s;tead of the proper le&s;&s;ons of our
cla&s;s; &s;o that we were forced, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to exchange books for
maps, coats of arms, plans of cities, ca&s;tles, &amp;c. and, at length, to
dabble with him in clay and dirt, in order to make a variety of fortifications,
with all their ap|purtenances and proper colours; and the&s;e he took no
&s;mall pride in &s;hewing to &s;tran|gers, but with this &s;alvo, that this
was our and his employment only between the &s;chool hours, tho' we were but
too &s;en&s;i|ble that they took up likewi&s;e all our &s;chool-time, &s;o that
&s;ome days we did no|thing el&s;e but that, to the neglect of every other
branch of learning that was proper for our cla&s;s. At length, after having
tri|fled away near two thirds of the year, to our no &s;mall detriment, and to
my great regret, who was &s;o far behind-hand in my my learning, I was timely
relieved, as I thought, by a letter from my mother, in|forming me, that the
rector of a &s;mall con|vent of Dominicans in our neighbourhood, was going to
teach philo&s;ophy to as many young gentlemen as he could get, and in|viting me
to make one of the number. <PB N="90" REF="92"> I readily agreed to it, the
convent being but a plea&s;ant walk out of my native city; and though I found I
mu&s;t take my leave of the cla&s;&s;ics if I went, yet I thought the learning
of philo&s;ophy would be both more creditable and u&s;eful, than the poor
&s;tuff which our Je&s;uit taught us; though had I been then as well acquainted
with the &s;ubtleties of Tho. Aquinas (or rather Ari&s;totle, for that is the
philo&s;ophy which the Dominicans teach) as I became after|wards, I doubt
whether I &s;hould ever have been one of his di&s;ciples, at lea&s;t by my
con&s;ent. However, I left the college without any further ceremony, and having
acquainted four or five of our cla&s;s that were my town&s;boys with my
de&s;ign, they &s;oon followed me, and at our coming to the rector, we found
that he had already about twenty more, &s;ome, from a great univer&s;ity about
&s;ixty miles off, others, from the neighbouring towns, &s;everal of them mere
dunces and ru&s;tics, with no other educa|tion than a little &s;mattering of
the Latin tongue, and not above five or &s;ix tolera|bly qualified for the
&s;tudy we were en|gaging in. As for me, whatever my old <PB N="91" REF="93">
Franci&s;can ma&s;ter might depend upon as to the &s;trength of my genius and
clo&s;ene&s;s of application, for acquiring the&s;e branches of learning I was
&s;till wanting in, yet the di&s;couragements which I had already en|countered
through his mi&s;management, in placing me in too high a form, as well as the
time we had trifled away in the cla&s;s of rhetoric, had much abated my
thir&s;t after learning; and the much greater di&s;|appointment I met with
under this new pretended teacher of philo&s;ophy, quite com|pleated my
misfortune, by turning it into a downright carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and indifference
a|bout it. For tho' I was naturally quick enough, and a&s;&s;iduous at whatever
I could gain the ma&s;tery of, and applau&s;e for &s;o doing, yet, whenever the
ca&s;e proved other|wi&s;e, no youth could be more naturally lazy and &s;upine
than I; &s;o that I cannot but think, on the &s;tricte&s;t recollection I can
make, that the&s;e many di&s;couragements &s;o clo&s;ely following one another,
were ra|ther the cau&s;e of that deplorable indolence I &s;ince contracted for
all laudable applica|tion to &s;tudy, than my own natural tem|per and genius,
which, had it been rightly <PB N="92" REF="94"> directed and encouraged by
proper motives, and e&s;pecially if kept under &s;ome &s;trict di&s;|cipline,
might have ea&s;ily been enabled to have overcome the greate&s;t difficulties
in almo&s;t every branch of learning: but to re|turn to our Dominican
rector.</P>
<P>He began as u&s;ual with logic, and di&s;play|ed a pretty good
talent at explaining it to as many of us as had a genius for it; for as to the
re&s;t, which were near two-thirds of his &s;chool, both he and we could
ea&s;ily perceive that he was only wronging them of their time and money,
though little did I think how &s;oon that was to be my ca&s;e: for though I
took his logic with &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing quickne&s;s and delight, as to have
but one competitor, and was become a great favourite of his, by the free and
hu|morous way in which I u&s;ed to put, now and then, &s;ome puzzling
que&s;tions to him; yet when we came to the &s;econd branch, which was
Ari&s;totle's phy&s;ics, with Aquinas's comments, I found it &s;uch an
unintelligible jargon, and him &s;o little qualified to ex|plain it to us, that
I became quite tired with it; for &s;ome of us, e&s;pecially my competitor and
I, expected at lea&s;t that he <PB N="93" REF="95"> would have made every point
as clear and evident to us, as he had before in logical lectures, and have
an&s;wered &s;uch objec|tions as we were able to rai&s;e again&s;t ei|ther the
doctrines, or his expo&s;itions; but, to our great &s;urprize, we found that he
had undertaken to expound what him&s;elf did not under&s;tand, and that
Aquinas's &s;ubtilities and di&s;tinctions were as much above his reach as
above ours. Thus, for in&s;tance, Ari&s;totle's account of the <HI>materia
prima,</HI> together with his &s;ubtile commen|tator's expo&s;itions on it, in
which our rector &s;pent above a fortnight, including the rubs we threw into
his way, appeared to us &s;uch an unintelligible heap of &s;tuff, that, at our
taking leave of it, to pa&s;s to another point, we made our&s;elves very merry
about it, and owned our&s;elves as much in the dark as when he began it;
in&s;omuch, that he was forced to own he never could thoroughly comprehend it,
and only delivered it to us on the autho|rity of that philo&s;opher, and of his
many eminent di&s;ciples of the Dominican order, &s;uch as Albertus Magnus,
Aquinas, &amp;c. &amp;c. I have &s;ince, upon running over his le&s;&s;ons 
<PB N="94" REF="96"> more carefully, found rea&s;on to doubt whe|ther a much
abler head than his, would not have been as much at a lo&s;s to have beat it
into any man's brain, that would not be &s;atisfied with words without a
meaning. However, as I plainly perceiv|ed that his chief view was to get our
mo|ney, without troubling him&s;elf whether our progre&s;s was an&s;werable, I
contracted by degrees &s;uch a habit of indolence and li&s;tle&s;&s;|ne&s;s to
all he &s;aid (e&s;pecially as he had got a &s;ingular knack at extricating
him&s;elf, when clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed, by &s;ome facetious joke or merry
&s;tory) that I wrote his lec|tures, and heard his expo&s;itions, without any
attention, or offering any objection, unle&s;s it was in the jocund way, and to
enliven our drooping &s;pirits, and without troubling my&s;elf whether what he
&s;aid or an&s;wered was right or wrong.</P>
<P>I know not whether it was not owing to his perceiving this
li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s in us, that he began to rai&s;e our expectation and hopes
that his metaphy&s;ics, which was &s;oon to follow, would prove more delightful
to us. We did indeed expect it, from the nature of the &s;ubjects it treats of,
and were not a little <PB N="95" REF="97"> impatient to have this quarter
fini&s;hed, that we might enter into a more entertaining field: but when we
found our&s;elves no le&s;s di&s;appointed in this, it only damped our
&s;pirits the more, and gave me a &s;till greater di&s;like to the jargon of
the &s;chool, &s;o that by that time we entered into the la&s;t quarter, when
ethics were to be the new &s;ubject of his lectures, and might have otherwi&s;e
proved more u&s;eful and en|tertaining to us, if it had been handled by a more
proper per&s;on, we were grown &s;o tired and out of conceit with him, that we
reaped no more benefit from it than we had from the re&s;t; and in&s;tead of
diverting our&s;elves with repetitions and di&s;putes a|bout his le&s;&s;ons,
as we u&s;ed to do at fir&s;t, we &s;tudied to forget every &s;ubject he had
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed to us, as &s;oon as we were got out of his &s;ight. Thus having
murdered, as I may &s;ay, another year, we were di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, not without
great applau&s;e and compliments to &s;ome of us, on account of our parts and
proficiency. But if I may judge of the re&s;t by my&s;elf, to whom he was
always plea&s;ed to allow the fir&s;t rank, I am &s;ure his prai&s;es were ill
be&s;towed as <PB N="96" REF="98"> to any benefit we had reaped from his pains
and ours: however, I was by that time become &s;o great a favourite to him,
that he afterwards left no means nor ca|re&s;&s;es untried to induce me to
enter into their order, and I believe, in the mind I then was in, he might
ea&s;ily have prevail|ed, had not my mother &s;trenuou&s;ly op|po&s;ed it. I
was &s;en&s;ible of my deficiency in all the branches of learning I had
hi|therto gone through, by the mi&s;conduct of tho&s;e under whom I had
learned, and could ea&s;ily &s;ee what dunces both my old Franci&s;can ma&s;ter
and this Dominican rec|tor were, though they pa&s;&s;ed for able men; and where
could I better conceal my own defects and ignorance than under a monk|i&s;h
habit, which would, at lea&s;t, give one the reputation of learning? But this I
had taken care to conceal from her, partly out of pride, and partly to prevent
her taking it to heart, and our rector had ad|dre&s;s enough to make her
believe I was a prodigy, con&s;idering how young I &s;till was, and to
per&s;uade her to &s;end me to the next univer&s;ity, and to learn theology
there, promi&s;ing to give me &s;uch a recom|mendation <PB N="97" REF="99"> to
the Dominicans who taught it there, as well as the Je&s;uits, that no pains
&s;hould be &s;pared to make me &s;hine in the world. She ea&s;ily con&s;ented
to it, and he gave me a certificate directed to the prior of their convent at
that great city, te&s;tifying that I had gone thro' a cour&s;e of philo&s;ophy,
and was fit to be admitted a &s;tudent in theology, to which he tacked &s;ome
farther commendations; all which could be of no &s;ervice to me, unle&s;s I
re|&s;olved to go and learn under the Domini|cans, for the Je&s;uits would
hardly have admitted me to that cla&s;s, before I had gone a new cour&s;e
through their philo&s;o|phy. It had been, indeed, much better for me to have
cho&s;en the latter, con&s;ider|ing the little proficiency I had made in it;
but my pride, and the fear of di&s;obliging my mother, determined me to the
for|mer, and I offered my&s;elf accordingly, and was readily admitted a
&s;tudent under two very reverend rectors, the one for the morning, and the
other for the afternoon; both very grave and learned, indeed, in their way;
but, upon my fir&s;t admittance, the &s;chool appeared to me like a new world, 
<PB N="98" REF="100"> where I was looked upon as a little raw &s;trippling, too
young quite, in all appear|ance, to herd among the re&s;t of the &s;tu|dents,
&s;ome of whom were twice my age, and none by many years &s;o young as I. What
was &s;till more di&s;couraging was, that here was no di&s;tinction made
between tho&s;e who had already &s;tudied near two years (for the whole
cour&s;e of theology la&s;ts two whole years) and tho&s;e who were but newly
admitted. The &s;ame lectures were read and expounded to all alike, and in the
u&s;ual cour&s;e, &s;o that tho&s;e who came not at the very beginning, had no
other chance, but at the end, to put middle and both ends together as well as
they could, which made the old &s;tanders a&s;&s;ume &s;uch an over|bearing air
over the new ones, as was alto|gether mortifying, at lea&s;t it proved &s;o to
me, who never had, till then, &s;een my &s;chool-fellows &s;o much above
me.</P>
<P>I may fairly date the completion of my ruin from the time of my
coming to this populous place, on more accounts than one: for fir&s;t, the city
was a noble, great one, full of gentry and nobility, of coaches, and all kinds
of grandeur, all which did greatly <PB N="99" REF="101"> affect me, who had
never &s;een &s;o much by far of the beau monde, neither in my native city, nor
in the archiepi&s;copal one, where I had &s;tudied under the Je&s;uits. 2dly, I
had been already cloyed with Aquinas's philo&s;ophy, when I had no &s;uch
bright tempting objects dancing before my eyes, what likelihood could there be
that &s;uch a &s;chool as this, &s;hould reconcile me to the more refined and
unintelligible &s;ub|tilities of his theology, e&s;pecially con&s;ider|ing the
di&s;advantages we late comers were forced to labour under, and the high
&s;tate which our two rectors took upon them? for here was no room for
objecting, or even de&s;iring a point or a term to be explained, and we had
nothing to do but to write what they dictated, and take their expo&s;i|tions
for &s;ound doctrine. Even tho&s;e who had &s;tudied longe&s;t under them, and
were looked upon as the brighte&s;t, were not in|dulged to &s;tart a
difficulty, though the oc|ca&s;ion was ever &s;o fair; all which damped my
&s;pirits, who had never been u&s;ed to &s;uch a re&s;traint, and had,
moreover, the mortification to &s;ee my&s;elf placed in the lowe&s;t rank, who
had, till then, been <PB N="100" REF="102"> mo&s;tly at the head, that I grew
by degrees quite out of conceit both with my&s;elf and with the &s;chool. What
added &s;till more to my di&s;contentedne&s;s was, that I boarded at &s;ome
near relations in one of the &s;uburbs of the city, and at a great di&s;tance
from the convent, and the&s;e commonly dined &s;o late, that I mu&s;t either
take up with an irregular meal, or come near an hour after the re&s;t to the
&s;chool. I did indeed pre|fer the fir&s;t for &s;ome time, but grew by degrees
weary of it, as the &s;tudy I was upon grew le&s;s engaging to me; &s;o that
though I took up as little time as I could at my dinner, yet one half hour, at
lea&s;t, was lo&s;t by it, and our rector had dictated &s;ome pages of matter
to the re&s;t, which, after &s;chool was over, I u&s;ed to copy out of the
manu&s;cripts of &s;ome of my &s;chool-fellows. Our rector having more than
once ob&s;erved what irregular hours I kept, was &s;o kind as to give me a
civil repri|mand, and not expecting, perhaps, a re|ply to it, was going on with
his lecture, but I had been &s;o little u&s;ed to make an&s;wers to it in dumb
&s;how, as I ob&s;erved many of his hearers were forced to do, that I 
<PB N="101" REF="103"> bluntly told him the occa&s;ion, a&s;&s;uring him, that
I had not influence enough in the family to prevail on them to alter their
hours.</P>
<P>The good father not approving of my ex|cu&s;e, which plainly
&s;hewed that I could not forego my dinner for his le&s;&s;ons, and might be an
ill precedent to &s;ome of the re&s;t, &s;eemed rather inclined to lay the
fault on my being better plea&s;ed with tho&s;e late hours of dining, or el&s;e
he thought I might ea&s;ily per&s;uade my relations to alter their method on my
account. But whether &s;o or not, he in&s;i&s;ted, and rea&s;onably enough,
that I &s;hould conform to the &s;chool-hours, whatever inconveniency it might
put me as to my dinner. I was &s;en&s;ible of the ju&s;tne&s;s of his reproof,
and after having been often at high words with my relati|ons (for they were
fully paid for my board) to no purpo&s;e, and tried to conform to the
&s;chool-hours for &s;ome time, I grew weary of it, and having nobody to
controul me, which proved my greate&s;t misfortune, I quite for&s;ook the
afternoon lectures, and &s;pent that time in &s;auntring about the city and
country adjacent, viewing the build|ings, <PB N="102" REF="104"> and
&s;ometimes taking plans and vi&s;|toes of &s;uch places as plea&s;ed me, but
without any other de&s;ign than to divert my&s;elf. I was, however,
&s;urpri&s;ed &s;oon after, to find my&s;elf interrogated by our morning
profe&s;&s;or, about the rea&s;on of my not coming to the afternoon lectures.
Whether my quondam ma&s;ter of philo&s;o|phy had wrote any thing particularly
con|cerning his expectation of getting me into their order or not, I knew not,
but I was in a genteel manner given to under&s;tand by this, that I ought to
look on it as a &s;in|gular favour that they &s;o far concerned them&s;elves
about me. What an&s;wer I made him, be&s;ides my thanking him for his care, I
cannot recollect; but though we parted good friends, I &s;oon after for&s;ook
his lecture al&s;o, and from that time minded little el&s;e but my own
plea&s;ures, which, though altogether of the innocent kind, &s;ometimes with
the fair &s;ex, at other times in viewing the curio&s;ities of the place, or
making &s;olitary excur&s;ions, and the like; yet were not without &s;ome
pungent remor&s;e, as they tended to little el&s;e but to inure me to a habit
of indolence and carele&s;s <PB N="103" REF="105"> inactivity. At &s;ome
intervals, indeed, I tried to read over all my manu&s;cripts both in
philo&s;ophy and theology, but &s;till &s;o di&s;|gu&s;ted with them, that I
never had the pa|tience to go through them.</P>
<P>I had before this &s;ent &s;ome complaining letters to my mother,
as well as me&s;&s;ages by word of mouth by &s;ome of my town&s;|men, who had
been witne&s;&s;es of the bad hours we kept, and to whom I had re|lated the
inconveniency it had put to, with relation to my &s;tudies; and &s;he, good
wo|man, thinking that I took it more to heart than I did, &s;ent me a &s;mall
&s;upply to con|vey me to Avignon, where I was to meet an old rich coun&s;ellor
of our town, who was gone to &s;pend &s;ome time in that famed city. He had no
children of his own, but &s;ome nephews, one of which he de&s;igned to breed up
a &s;cholar under me, in con&s;i|deration of which I was to lodge and board
with the uncle, till I could better provide for my&s;elf. As this was likely to
be a kind of change for the better for me, as well as an ea&s;ement to my
mother, who&s;e &s;trait circum&s;tances could hardly permit her to be at
&s;uch expence for my education, I <PB N="104" REF="106"> made no delay to go
down to Avignon, where I found the old gentleman ready to receive me, and, a
day or two after, en|tered into my new office of tutor to his nephew, who had
already made &s;ome pro|gre&s;s in the Latin Grammar. I had not been long there
before I got acquainted with a young abb&eacute;, or candidate for prie&s;tly
orders, a countryman of mine, and an in|genious young man, of &s;ome learning;
and he finding that I had &s;tudied philo&s;ophy and theology under the
Dominicans, in|troduced me to one of their profe&s;&s;ors in this city, by whom
I was courteou&s;ly re|ceived, and &s;oon after admitted to be one of his
di&s;ciples. This father, who was a man of &s;ingular mode&s;ty and humanity,
and was reputed a &s;aint, paid me an un|common regard upon my fir&s;t
admi&s;&s;ion to his lectures, and made an apology to the re&s;t of his
&s;cholars for recapitulating &s;ome of his former le&s;&s;ons and
expo&s;itions, <HI>in gratiam,</HI> as he was plea&s;ed to word it,
<HI>chari&s;&s;imi no&s;tri novi di&s;cipuli,</HI> that I might the better
under&s;tand what he was then, and afterwards, to deliver to us. This great
conde&s;cen&s;ion, which had not been <PB N="105" REF="107"> &s;hewed to me by
either of the profe&s;&s;ors of the la&s;t univer&s;ity, and which I &s;ince
under&s;tood was not u&s;ual among them, did highly oblige me, and I would have
been glad to have made &s;uch a proficiency under him, as might have, in &s;ome
mea|&s;ure, an&s;wered his &s;ingular kindne&s;s to me, which he &s;till
continued to expre&s;s all the time I went to hear him, but my misfor|tune was,
that I was &s;till &s;o unacquainted as well as di&s;gu&s;ted at the
&s;ubtilities of the &s;chool, and met with &s;uch crampt di&s;tinc|tions and
technical terms I was &s;till a &s;tranger to, and was a&s;hamed to a&s;k the
meaning of from any of the &s;cholars, who were far enough from thinking me
&s;o great a novice to the language of the Thomi&s;ts, that I began again, in
&s;pite of all his ca|re&s;&s;es, and my own eager de&s;ires, to de|&s;pair of
ever becoming a theologian; and the&s;e difficulties added to the lazy and
unthinking habit I had &s;o long indulged, made me at length forbear going any
more to hear him.</P>
<P>I have already hinted that my mother's cir|cum&s;tances were too
narrow for the expence I had already put her to, and my father 
<PB N="106" REF="108"> was &s;till more unable to give her any
a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in it, though he was not a little plea&s;ed at the great
progre&s;s he was told I had made for my years. Her hopes and mine were,
indeed, that I might by that means introduce my&s;elf as a tutor into &s;ome
good family, and &s;ave her all farther charges. But I had been &s;o far
neglected in the o|ther parts of my education, had &s;o little addre&s;s or
politene&s;s, and knew &s;o little of the world, that I could not look upon
my&s;elf as fit for &s;uch an employment a|mong per&s;ons above the common
rank, and my pride would not let me aim at any thing below it; &s;o that
in&s;tead of trying as I might, and ought to have done, I was rather become
carele&s;s and indifferent a|bout it, and I was indeed both too young and too
naturally unfit for it. Notwith|&s;tanding which, &s;ome of my acquaintance,
unknown or unde&s;ired, got me into a mid|dling family, where I was upon
&s;omewhat better terms than with my old coun&s;ellor; but the overgrown youth,
who was put under my care, and was much older, and taller by the head and
&s;houlders than I, had, by that time, contracted &s;uch an in|dolence, 
<PB N="107" REF="109"> or rather aver&s;ene&s;s, both to the Latin tongue, and
to other laudable &s;tudies, that had I been ever &s;o diligent in teach|ing
him, it would have been to little pur|po&s;e, becau&s;e, as I &s;oon found, he
wanted parts as well as inclination for &s;tudy; &s;o that we &s;pent more of
our time in play|ing on the violin and flute than at our books. His mother, who
heard us at it longer and oftner than &s;he thought was con&s;i&s;tent with the
progre&s;s &s;he expected him to make under me, complained more than once of it
to me; upon which I made no difficulty to tell her, that a greater degree of
application would rather confirm him in his aver&s;ene&s;s, than reconcile him
to his &s;tudy, as he had &s;o &s;mall a capacity for it. I left this &s;oon
after for a better place with a per&s;on of di&s;tinction, who in|tru&s;ted two
&s;ons of his to my care, both very young, and &s;poiled by the mother, that
the elde&s;t, above &s;even years of age, could but ju&s;t read, and neither of
them inclined to learn. I tried what I could to bring them to it, but to little
purpo&s;e, ex|cept a little hi&s;tory, which the elde&s;t took more freely to,
but the mother's indul|gence <PB N="108" REF="110"> was not the only
ob&s;tacle, and as &s;he was a &s;prightly lady, and her &s;pou&s;e &s;omewhat
heavy, though not old, I &s;oon found by her behaviour, and her parting beds
with him &s;oon after my coming, that &s;he would have been better plea&s;ed I
had transferred my care from them to her; and as I was naturally fond of
ingratiating my&s;elf with the &s;ex, I indulged her in all her little foibles,
but without having the lea&s;t de&s;ign of going farther than a bare
complai&s;ance, in order to gain her e&s;teem and admiration, rather than her
affection, and to &s;atisfy my own vanity, rather than cheri&s;h a dangerous
pa&s;&s;ion for her. This made me to take frequent occa&s;ions to re|commend
my&s;elf by fal&s;e merit, &s;ince I had no real one that could do it, by
pre|tending to more virtue and religion than I had, and to palliate the low
circum&s;tances of my parents by &s;ome vain excu&s;es, and pretences, all
which I did with &s;o little caution, and in &s;o aukward a manner, as made me
appear rather more de&s;picable in her eyes, con&s;idering the mean appearance
I made, and which was owing chiefly to my own negligence and bad oeconomy. 
<PB N="109" REF="111"> All the&s;e di&s;advantages, however, might have been
ea&s;ily overlooked, and I might have been readily &s;uffered to indulge my own
prevailing pa&s;&s;ion, if I could but have &s;hewed more concern for hers.</P>
<P>It is not my de&s;ign to dwell on &s;uch &s;cenes as the&s;e, much
le&s;s to a&s;cribe my neglect and overlooking the &s;everal di&s;tant offers
made by &s;o agreeable a per&s;on to my own virtue. I might more ju&s;tly
impute it to my natural &s;heepi&s;h ba&s;hfulne&s;s, and un|experienced youth;
however, after a &s;ix month's &s;tay, and &s;ome vi&s;ible proofs that it was
not in my power to conquer it, I perceived a &s;trange coldne&s;s to &s;ucceed,
which made me think it would not be long before I was di&s;charged. She was
&s;oon after vi&s;ited by &s;ome relations, who per|&s;uaded her to go and
&s;pend &s;ome part of the &s;ummer with them about twenty miles off. They,
e&s;pecially the gentlemen, af|fected the air of libertines, and all of them
expre&s;&s;ed a &s;ingular contempt for the &s;u|per&s;titions of the church of
Rome, by which I gue&s;&s;ed them to be concealed Pro|te&s;tants, of whom there
were great num|bers in Languedoc, Provence, Dauphinee, <PB N="110" REF="112">
and I have had &s;ince rea&s;on to think, that my young lady was &s;o
likewi&s;e, by her light behaviour at church, and on other occa&s;i|ons. I had
&s;ome &s;mall di&s;putes with them, being then very zealous for that church,
but they knowing that I had &s;tudied divi|nity, and fearing, I &s;uppo&s;e,
le&s;t too ea|ger an oppo&s;ition to what I urged again&s;t them &s;hould
cau&s;e a di&s;covery, they de|clined entering the li&s;t with me any far|ther,
and I then found, for the fir&s;t time, that the Prote&s;tants had more to
&s;ay for them&s;elves than I had ever imagined; for the divinity we were
taught at the &s;chools &s;eldom meddled with the controver&s;ies be|tween us
and the Prote&s;tants, &s;o that had it not been for fear, tho&s;e gentlemen, I
found, might ea&s;ily have foiled me, not|with&s;tanding all my theology. The
lady was preparing for her journey, and was to take her &s;ons with her, yet
kept me in &s;u&s;pen&s;e whether I was to accompany her, or &s;tay with her
hu&s;band, or be di&s;charged. I have had rea&s;on to think &s;ince, that &s;he
had an end in it; but finding my behavi|our &s;till aukward and unpromi&s;ing,
not|with&s;tanding &s;ome fre&s;h e&s;&s;ays, which I <PB N="111" REF="113">
did not then &s;o well comprehend, &s;he left it to her hu&s;band, who was a
per&s;on that cared for nothing but his bottle, and left her to do as &s;he
plea&s;ed in every thing el&s;e, to acquaint me with the news that they
&s;hould have no farther occa&s;ion for me. I was more grieved than
&s;urpri&s;ed at it, which, &s;he perceiving, occa&s;ioned one more &s;nare to
be laid by means of the chambermaid, which proving &s;till un&s;uc|ce&s;sful,
and this was the very night before they were to &s;et out, I was de&s;pi&s;ed
and laughed at, and given to under&s;tand, that I might thank my&s;elf if the
lady and I went different ways.</P>
<P>I have already hinted that virtue and reli|gion had little or no
&s;hare in my di&s;ap|pointing her, but rather a vanity of being thought more
cha&s;te than I really was, which kept me &s;o indeed, as to the act, not only
on this, but many other ren|counters, though in heart and thought few men were
more &s;trangers to that vir|tue than I, even at tho&s;e tender years; and
though religion, which, in all my fooli&s;h extravagancies, I never once lo&s;t
&s;ight of, held &s;till &s;ome check on my mind, yet <PB N="112" REF="114"> it
could hardly turn even the &s;cale again&s;t any favourite pa&s;&s;ion of mine,
farther than to make me condemn my&s;elf after having yielded to it; &s;o that
it was rather the fear of a repul&s;e, or &s;ome other or wor&s;e
con|&s;equence that kept me from &s;hewing an equal ardor for her, whatever
opinion my different behaviour might give her of me. The company and &s;he were
no &s;ooner gone than I took the road to Avignon, where I heard that my old
coun&s;ellor was gone home, with his nephews, to my no &s;mall grief,
e&s;pecially as my pockets were then low; the widow where we had boarded very
poor, and I had &s;o few acquaintance in that city; however, I ven|tured to
&s;tay with her till I could write to my mother for a fre&s;h &s;upply, or till
&s;ome|thing better fell in my way, though I had little rea&s;on to expect any
&s;ucce&s;s from ei|ther; being by this time become very &s;habby in cloaths
and linnen, and more indolent and inactive than ever. To ward off, as much as
po&s;&s;ible, the pungent mor|tification of my pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, I had
recour&s;e to my old &s;tratagem, of cloath|ing my&s;elf with &s;ome fal&s;e
merit for want <PB N="113" REF="115"> of a great one, and of pretending to be a
&s;ufferer for religion for a too great attach|ment to the church, and laying
mo&s;t of the blame on my own father, as u&s;ing me the more &s;everely on that
account; all which, though abominably fal&s;e in every re&s;pect, yet being too
ea&s;ily li&s;tened to by &s;ome of my acquaintance, e&s;pecially among the
friars, did gain me &s;o much pity and admiration, as &s;oothed my vanity for
the pre&s;ent, though it did not an&s;wer the main end I propo&s;ed, its
introducing me into &s;ome new family as a tutor, and at the &s;ame time
accounting, in &s;ome tolera|ble mea&s;ure, for the mean appearance I then
made.</P>
<P>I was about the &s;ame time informed that the famed fair of
Baucaire, a city in Lan|guedoc, on the Rhone, and one of the large&s;t fairs in
Europe, was at hand, and that among the great concour&s;e at it, I might meet
with &s;ome of my own town&s;|men, from whom I might get a fre&s;h &s;up|ply. I
went accordingly, and found there &s;everal merchants of my acquaintance, who
furni&s;hed me with as much money for the pre&s;ent, as would ju&s;t &s;erve,
but, on the <PB N="114" REF="116"> next day, when I expected to have re|ceived
a much larger &s;um, I only met with a &s;evere reprimand for my mean
ap|pearance, and for not having made a better u&s;e of the opportunities I had
had of di&s;|charging my mother from all future ex|pences on my account. I
excu&s;ed it as well as I could to them, they being no &s;trangers to the great
poverty, not to &s;ay univer&s;al mi&s;ery, that then reigned at A|vignon,
where the &s;treets abounded with people, who, from living very comforta|bly,
and &s;ome of them richly, on the &s;ilk manufacture of the place, were, on the
decay of it, reduced to the lowe&s;t degree of beg|gary. They told me, that
though that was too truly the ca&s;e of the trade&s;men, yet the prie&s;ts and
monks lived in as much plenty as ever, and a lad of my parts and learning might
ea&s;ily have found means to have recommended him&s;elf to &s;ome of them,
in&s;tead of appearing in &s;uch a gui&s;e as I did, and which they &s;aid made
them apprehen&s;ive I had taken up &s;ome ill cour&s;es. This cen&s;ure, which
was no le&s;s unju&s;t than &s;evere, if they &s;poke what they thought, did
cut me to the heart; for no <PB N="115" REF="117"> youth could be more free
from the vices of drinking, gaming, intriguing, &amp;c. than I was. Happy it
would have been for me if I could have as ea&s;ily di&s;culpated my&s;elf from
tho&s;e of indolence, vanity, and bad oeconomy; for the&s;e were the true
&s;ources of my misfortunes, in&s;omuch that I am per&s;uaded, if they had
&s;upplied me with as great a &s;um, as I could in rea&s;on have de&s;ired, I
&s;hould have been induced to have laid out the greate&s;t part of it in &s;uch
curious nicknacks and trifles as that fair affords, e&s;pecially of the
mu&s;i|cal kind; for I had already, in that &s;hort interval, agreed for a good
number of them; but whether they had &s;et any body to watch my motions, and
gue&s;&s;ed at the prepo&s;terous u&s;e I &s;hould make of what money they
might lend me, or whatever other rea&s;on they might have, they ab&s;o|lutely
refu&s;ed to let me have even &s;o much as would bring me back to Avignon; &s;o
that one may ea&s;ily imagine the di&s;mal plight I was in all the way thither,
to &s;ay nothing of that mortification I &s;hould meet with among my
acquaintance there at my ill &s;ucce&s;s. I found, however, a plau&s;ible 
<PB N="116" REF="118"> excu&s;e for it, by pretending that I was come a day or
two too late, and that the merchants were, by that time, &s;o &s;hort of ca&s;h
that they could not &s;upply me, but that they would remit me what I wanted
&s;oon after their return home. I likewi&s;e told my old landlady, to whom I
was hardly indebted for a quarter of a year's board and lodging, that I
expected two of them to be there &s;hortly at an approaching fair, which was
actually true, and &s;he knew and dealt with one of them for &s;ome &s;ort of
goods, &s;o that had I had the pa|tience to have &s;taid till then, my mother,
who had expre&s;&s;ed no &s;mall re&s;entment at their ungenerous refu&s;al,
would not have failed &s;ending me a fre&s;h &s;upply by them; whereas, hearing
that I had left the place, &s;he &s;ent only what would pay the poor wo|man,
whil&s;t I, unknown to her, or any one el&s;e, had taken a re&s;olution to
return home, bare as I was of money and cloaths.</P>
<P>I lately took notice of my &s;hameful pre|tence of being a kind of
&s;ufferer for reli|gion, to &s;ome of my acquaintance, and tho' vanity and my
then ill plight was my only incentive to it, I began now to think 
<PB N="117" REF="119"> it might be made a means of facilitating my long journey
homewards; I went ac|cordingly and furni&s;hed my&s;elf with a kind of pa&s;s,
or certificate, at a proper office, &s;ignifying that I was a young &s;tudent
in theology, of Iri&s;h extract, and that I had left the country for the &s;ake
of religion, by which is commonly implied the Ro|man Catholic, and that I was
then going on a pilgrimage to Rome. This ab&s;urd and fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertion
co&s;t me &s;ince many a &s;hameful lye to make it pa&s;s for current,
e&s;pecially as often as I met with any per|&s;ons who had any tolerable
knowledge of Iri&s;h affairs, to which I was an utter &s;tranger. I did,
indeed, know &s;everal Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h, who had followed king James's
fortune, and were well re&s;pected in France, Italy, &amp;c. but my vanity
could not be &s;atisfied with the credit of pa&s;&s;ing for the &s;on of &s;ome
one of them; I wanted to have it thought my own voluntary act, that I for&s;ook
that country and my parents, and fortune, for the &s;ake of religion. Had the
&s;ecretary, from whom I had procured that certificate, been ever &s;o little
diffident, my very name, which had nothing of Iri&s;h <PB N="118" REF="120"> or
Engli&s;h, but which my pride would not let me forego, becau&s;e it had
&s;omething of quality in it, would ea&s;ily have di&s;co|vered the roguery of
the pretence; and this I mention to &s;hew my ra&s;hne&s;s and ignorance, of
which I &s;hall give a fur|ther in&s;tance, in the method I took immediately
after obtaining the pa&s;s, to equip my&s;elf in a pilgrim's garb; for I was
not in a condition to purcha&s;e one, tho' it con&s;i&s;ted only of a long
&s;taff hand&s;omely turned, and a &s;hort leathern or oil-cloth cloak, not
unlike what the women call a pelerine. However, I had ob&s;erved &s;uch a one
in a chapel belonging to a pari&s;h-church, and dedicated to a miraculous
&s;aint, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, had been &s;et up there as a monument of
gratitude by &s;ome wan|dering pilgrim come to the end of his jour|ney. The
chapel was never without a number of devotees, who prayed and burnt tapers
before the image of the &s;aint; but this did not deter me from venturing in,
and taking both &s;taff and cloak away at noon-day; had I been examined about
it, I was only furni&s;hed with a juvenile pre|tence, that I looked upon it to
be &s;et up <PB N="119" REF="121"> there to accommodate &s;uch pilgrims as
could not otherwi&s;e provide them&s;elves with it. How far &s;uch a poor
excu&s;e might have gone I know not, neither did I trouble my head about it;
however, I e&s;caped without &s;uch an enquiry, and carried it off
unmole&s;ted, and made what ha&s;te I could to &s;ome private corner, where I
threw the cloak over my &s;houlders, and walked with a &s;anctified gravity
with the &s;taff in my hand, till I was got out of the city.</P>
<P>Being thus accoutred, and furni&s;hed with a pa&s;s to my mind, I
began at all proper places to beg my way in a fluent Latin; acco&s;ting only
clergymen, or per&s;ons of figure, by whom I could be under|&s;tood, and was
mo&s;t likely to be relieved; and I found them mo&s;tly &s;o generous and
credulous, that had I had the lea&s;t propen|&s;ity to provide for hereafter, I
might ea&s;ily have &s;aved a good deal of money, and put my&s;elf into a much
more creditable garb, before I had gone through a &s;core or two of miles; but
&s;uch was my vanity and ex|travagance, that as &s;oon as I had got what I
thought a &s;ufficient viaticum, I begged no more, but viewed every thing worth
<PB N="120" REF="122"> &s;eeing, then retired to &s;ome inn, where I &s;pent my
money as freely as I got it, not without &s;ome &s;uch aukward tokens of
genero&s;ity, as better &s;uited with my vanity than my pre&s;ent
circum&s;tances. The nearer I drew to my native place, the more irre|&s;olute I
grew, whether I &s;hould pay a vi|&s;it to my mother, or continue my journey to
Rome; the concern I knew &s;he mu&s;t be in about me, &s;trongly inclined me to
the former, but my uncommon mean garb, which was become only more &s;candalous
by the length of the journey, made me &s;o a&s;hamed to be &s;een either by
her, or any of my friends, that I fully re&s;olved on the latter. I had, in
order to it, wheeled a|bout to the left, to leave the place at &s;ome twenty or
thirty miles di&s;tance, and was got into a &s;mall town where I little
ex|pected to be known, when venturing on the Sunday into the church, at the
time of high ma&s;s, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;ome per&s;ons,
e&s;pecially two or three gentle|women, who&s;e chief re&s;idence was at my
native city, but who it &s;eems were &s;pending part of the &s;ummer at that
place, and who, in &s;pight of my being thus <PB N="121" REF="123">
tran&s;mogrified, did ea&s;ily recall me to mind, and gave me to under&s;tand
they did. I was &s;o &s;hocked at it, that I left the church at the mo&s;t
&s;olemn part of the &s;ervice, when they were mo&s;t intent on their
de|votions, not caring to &s;tand an examen from them, and made the be&s;t of
my way through private paths, to avoid being caught if pur&s;ued. Whether I was
&s;o I know not, but the &s;ight of them made &s;uch a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion
on my mind, and rai&s;ed &s;uch an earne&s;t de&s;ire in me of &s;eeing once
more that beloved city, e&s;pecially con&s;idering that it was now
impo&s;&s;ible to conceal either my way of travelling, or mean appearance from
my friends, that as &s;oon as I thought my&s;elf out of the reach of a
pur&s;uit, I took the direct road home|ward, with an intent to go and &s;atisfy
my poor anxious mother, before &s;he got the intelligence from other hands, and
con&s;ult with her, whether I &s;hould pur&s;ue my journey to Rome, or get into
any other way &s;he liked better. And I only took care to enter the city in the
dusk of the even|ing, and got to her hou&s;e unperceived by any but tho&s;e of
the family.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="124">My poor mother was glad to &s;ee me, tho'
&s;orry to behold the mean garb I was in, and failed not, though with her
u&s;ual ten|derne&s;s, to chide me, for having made &s;o bad an u&s;e of the
opportunities, &s;he &s;up|po&s;ed I had had, of pu&s;hing my fortune, which,
&s;he knew as well as I, was but too much owing to my indolence. Much more
rea&s;on would &s;he have had to chide me, had &s;he known how much of my time
I had trifled away during the la&s;t year and half I had been ab&s;ent from
her; but that I concealed from her, and the good woman was &s;ometimes inclined
to think, that my too great eagerne&s;s after my &s;tudies had made me neglect
every thing el&s;e. But I was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed at the end of two or three
days, during which I had kept as much from &s;ight as I could, to hear her
propo&s;e to me, &s;ince I had found out &s;o cheap, &s;afe, and ea&s;y a way
of travelling, to go and pay a vi&s;it to my father, who then lived &s;ome
hun|dreds of miles from her, and try what I could get him to do for me; and I
had the more rea&s;on to wonder at her propo|&s;al, becau&s;e &s;he knew, as
well as I, that a <PB N="123" REF="125"> trade&s;man of our town, who had been
with him about two or three years before, had brought us a very indifferent
account of his circum&s;tances. This made me &s;u|&s;pect that a cou&s;in of
mine, and a great fa|vourite of hers, who&s;e fortune was in no wi&s;e
&s;uitable to his high &s;pirit, had put that &s;trange project in her head,
that I might be far enough out of the way of ob&s;tructing her kindne&s;s to
him. Whe|ther there was any real foundation for my &s;u&s;picion, I cannot
&s;ay, but the &s;urprize &s;he ob&s;erved me to be in at her propo&s;al, made
&s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon her, that &s;he forgot nothing that could
a&s;&s;ure me of her maternal and unalterable tenderne&s;s, alledging that
&s;he only wanted to be bet|ter &s;atisfied of the condition my father was in,
than &s;he was from the report of the trade&s;man above mentioned, and adding,
that in ca&s;e I found it not to my liking, and him as tender as I might
expect, &s;he charged me expre&s;sly to leave him, and come back to her as
&s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and by no means to &s;tay longer than a year from her,
unle&s;s I could convince her that it was very much to my advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="126">Being thus far &s;atisfied of her maternal
af|fection, I ea&s;ily con&s;ented to take the journey, having by that time
contracted an inclination to ramble and &s;ee new coun|tries, and as it was a
long and dangerous one, we thought it improper to alter my dre&s;s, the
meane&s;s of which would rather be a &s;afeguard; however, &s;he thought fit to
&s;ew up a &s;mall quantity of gold to my cloaths, which, &s;he &s;aid, would
&s;erve to buy me &s;ome better ones, when I came near the end of my journey.
My &s;taff and cloak, with the addition of a long loo&s;e gown, made of a light
kind of black buck|ram to cover the re&s;t from du&s;t, were &s;ent by a man to
a place on the road, about four miles off; and very early in the morn|ing I
took a &s;orrowful leave of my mo|ther, and &s;he of me, and &s;he repeated her
charge to me to return to her, if I did not find things to my &s;atisfaction.
When I came to the place where my pilgrim's dre&s;s waited for me, I put it on,
and went on not without a heavy heart, tho' with|out the lea&s;t doubt of my
mother's con|&s;tant affection. My direct rout was thro' the fir&s;t great
univer&s;ity where I had be|gan <PB N="125" REF="127" MS="y"> to &s;tudy
theology, &s;o that I was forced to wheel about to avoid it, for fear of being
known. All the re&s;t of the way I was an utter &s;tranger to, and I met
frequently with &s;ome objects that made me &s;hrink, tho' it was a
con&s;iderable high road; now and then at &s;ome lonely place lay the carca&s;e
of a man rotting and &s;tinking on the ground by the way-&s;ide, with a rope
about his neck, which was fa&s;tened to a po&s;t about two or three yards
di&s;tance, and the&s;e were the bodies of highwaymen, or rather of
&s;ol|diers, &s;ailors, mariners, or even galley-&s;laves, di&s;banded after
the peace of Re&s;|wick, who, having neither home nor occu|pation, u&s;ed to
infe&s;t the roads in troops, plunder towns and villages, and when ta|ken were
hanged at the county-town by dozens, or even &s;cores &s;ometimes, after which
their bodies were thus expo&s;ed a|long the highway <HI>in terrorem.</HI> At
other places one met with cro&s;&s;es, either of wood or &s;tone, the highe&s;t
not above two or three feet, with in&s;criptions to this pur|port; 
<Q REND="inline">"pray for the &s;oul of A. B. or of a &s;tranger
that was found murdered on this &s;pot."</Q> The&s;e deterring objects made me 
<PB N="126" REF="128"> willing to a&s;&s;ociate my&s;elf to &s;ome
fel|low-travellers whom I met on the &s;ame road; but &s;uch was my vanity,
that I never renewed the pilgrim's trade of begging whil&s;t any of my money
la&s;ted, but was rather lavi&s;h of it on &s;ome of them, tho' I know not how
&s;oon I might feel the want of it; and I had not re&s;umed it long before I
met with &s;uch a mortification as made me heartily repent of my folly. I was
to go through the celebrated city of Lyons, abounding with the fine&s;t
buildings and other curio&s;ities, which I was very de|&s;irous to &s;ee; and
when I came to one of the gates, was asked by an officer, in a li|very like our
beadles, whether I wanted a viaticum? Not knowing the con&s;equence of his
que&s;tion, I an&s;wered in the affirmative, and was bid immediately to follow
him. I was &s;urpri&s;ed at the length of the way he led me, and ob&s;erved
&s;everal fine churches, palaces, &s;quares, &amp;c. which I &s;tood &s;till to
admire, but was not &s;uffered to do &s;o long; and at length, after about an
hour and half's good walking, was told, that that was the oppo&s;ite gate at
which I was <PB N="127" REF="129"> to go out and pur&s;ue my journey; he then
clapped a couple of pence into my hand, and told me, that I mu&s;t not venture
back into the city under &s;ome &s;evere puni&s;h|ment, and left me quite
a&s;toni&s;hed and unable to reply. As &s;oon as I had reco|vered my&s;elf, I
began to reflect on my ex|travagance and di&s;appointment in a mo&s;t lively
manner, but thought it be&s;t, how|ever, to follow his advice, rather than
ex|po&s;e my&s;elf to &s;ome &s;hameful treatment, if I attempted to return.
What increa&s;ed my concern was, the fear of finding the &s;ame method
ob&s;erved in every great city I came to, but, happily for me, it proved
otherwi&s;e, and I not only went through them all without mole&s;tation, but
&s;taid in &s;ome of them long enough to view every thing worth &s;eeing, and
to conver&s;e with men of learning and piety, from whom I received &s;ome
tokens of their genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>The misfortune was, that my ra&s;hne&s;s and vanity would not
&s;uffer me to keep within due bounds, but I mu&s;t &s;et my&s;elf off to the
highe&s;t advantage, by pretending to greater merit and learning than was
con&s;i&s;t|ent <PB N="128" REF="130"> even with common prudence, as it
ex|po&s;ed me to the continual danger of a &s;hame|ful di&s;covery. I took
notice heretofore how little progre&s;s I had made in the Greek tongue, rather
through the igno|rance and neglect of &s;ome of my teachers, than want of
capacity or application, but now I pretended to be not only ma&s;ter of it, but
likewi&s;e in &s;ome mea&s;ure of the Hebrew, though I knew not a &s;ingle
let|ter of the latter, and had only &s;een &s;ome Hebrew books belonging to the
Jews of Avignon, by which I ju&s;t could di&s;tingui&s;h that from other
characters; the truth is, that neither that nor any of the oriental tongues,
nor even the Greek, were much &s;tudied by the clergy; &s;o I was not under any
great danger on that account, though I own I have been &s;ometimes foiled at
the latter, becau&s;e I commonly addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the prie&s;ts, among
whom I met, now and then, with one who under&s;tood it. I mu&s;t al&s;o
acknowledge that I found the generality of them very charitable, and &s;ome of
them even generous, though it the more redounds to my &s;hame, &s;eeing neither
the meanne&s;s of my garb, of <PB N="129" REF="131"> which yet I was not a
little a&s;hamed, nor the mortifying accidents that had happened to me could
prevail upon me to &s;ave a &s;hil|ling towards buying any thing better. I had
indeed &s;ome hopes to do &s;o, as I came nearer to my father, but here I was
again ju&s;tly di&s;appointed; the two or three la&s;t provinces I was to
pa&s;s through, hav|ing been greatly impoveri&s;hed, and even laid wa&s;te by
the late war, &s;o that I found the clergy here le&s;s rich and generous, and
&s;o great poverty reigned among the laity, that I had much ado to get
&s;ufficient &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance among them. I &s;hould likewi&s;e ob&s;erve
here, that every town, or even village I came through, had a number of
Lutherans and Calvini&s;ts, who were &s;till in a wor&s;e condition, in&s;omuch
that their mini&s;ters were obliged to keep &s;ome poor inn or alehou&s;e for
&s;ub&s;i&s;tance; &s;o that by that time I had reached my father I was quite
pennyle&s;s and threadbare. I pre|&s;ently, however, made my&s;elf known to
him, though to his great &s;urpri&s;e, not only on that account, but as it was
&s;uch an un|expected vi&s;it, of which he had not had the lea&s;t notice given
him, nor did at all <PB N="130" REF="132"> dream of. The city where I met him
be|ing about three or four miles from his hou&s;e, he clapped a &s;mall piece
in my hand, and directed me to a hou&s;e where I might get &s;ome
refre&s;hment, and towards night conducted me to his own home, which I was not
a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find even meaner than our town&s;man had de&s;cribed
to my mother and me. Here he bid me a fre&s;h and mo&s;t tender welcome, and
ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;uch a vi&s;ible concern that he was not able to give me at
lea&s;t as good enter|tainment as I had been u&s;ed to with my mother, that I
was hardly able to make him a proper an&s;wer.</P>
<P>And indeed the difference I found between the two places, the
forlorn condition I &s;aw my&s;elf in, the mean figure I made in an ob&s;cure
kind of village, my being now not only out of the way of any improvement, but
in danger of lo&s;ing what I had got, afforded me &s;uch a di&s;mal pro&s;pect,
that I could not ea&s;ily conceal my unea&s;ine&s;s, and, in a little time, a
more than ordinary de&s;ire of returning to my old home, &s;ince this new one
was in every re&s;pect &s;o little inviting to me. He found it no le&s;s
diffi|cult <PB N="131" REF="133"> to conceal his di&s;like of my returning to
my mother, and tried all he could to di&s;&s;uade me from it. He advi&s;ed me
to try my fortune at two or three neighbour|ing cities or univer&s;ities, and I
complied with his de&s;ire, but found much greater di&s;couragements than I
could expect: fir&s;t, the Je&s;uits were the teachers in all of them, and I
had &s;tudied with the Dominicans, between whom and them there never was a
right under&s;tanding, but rather quite the contrary. I was got into a new
country, (Germany) where the pronunciation of the Latin differed &s;o much from
that I had been u&s;ed to, that though no one could &s;peak it more fluently
than I, I neither could under&s;tand them, nor make my&s;elf under&s;tood by
them, without the greate&s;t difficulty. The country had been &s;o ruin|ed by
the war, that tho&s;e few mendi|cant &s;cholars that remained in tho&s;e
uni|ver&s;ities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;t of the univer&s;ities of Germany
have a number of the&s;e mendicant &s;tudents, who, as &s;oon as the
&s;chool-hours are over, go along the &s;treets from hou&s;e to hou&s;e,
&s;ing|ing &s;ome pious Latin ver&s;es to excite people's charity, and, in
&s;ome opulent cities, get enough to live well and comfortably, and to buy all
the books that are nece&s;&s;ary for them, by which means &s;ome of them become
very learned men, and get to good preferment; but as it was quite otherwi&s;e
in the&s;e, and, indeed, every city along the Rhine, quite down below the great
city of Cologn (where the French forces had cau&s;ed &s;uch dreadful
delapidations as could not be &s;een without horror); the&s;e univer&s;ities
had been long &s;ince for&s;aken by all tho&s;e mendicant &s;tu|dents, who
could no longer find means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting them. And this I afterwards
ob&s;erved to be the ca&s;e in every place where the French troops had been, as
I may have further occa&s;ion to &s;hew in the &s;equel.</NOTE>, might be
rather &s;aid to &s;tarve than <PB N="132" REF="134"> to &s;ub&s;i&s;t. My
youth and ignorance of the German tongue, as well as my foreign pronunciation
of the Latin and Greek, would likewi&s;e have di&s;qualified me for being a
tutor in any family, had there been any in a condition to have maintained one;
&s;o that after all my efforts, which I rather tried out of obedience to my
fa|ther, than any likely hopes I could have of &s;ucce&s;s, I returned to him
<HI>re infecta,</HI> all which only &s;erved to revive my de&s;ires of
returning to my mother. But he being &s;till as aver&s;e to it as ever,
bethought him|&s;elf of a new way to di&s;&s;uade me from it, and with &s;o
much art at the &s;ame time, that I could not di&s;cover his aim. He had &s;een
the greate&s;t part of Europe, and <PB N="133" REF="135" MS="y"> could give an
extraordinary account of it; he under&s;tood &s;everal of its languages,
particularly the Italian, French, Spani&s;h and German, and expatiated much on
the advantages he had gained by travelling; and expre&s;&s;ed, at &s;ome
di&s;tance, a de&s;ire that I &s;hould vi&s;it &s;everal of tho&s;e coun|tries
I had not yet &s;een, particularly tho&s;e of Holland, Flanders, and Brabant,
which he highly commended for their opulence, and the great number of learned
men they produced, and expatiated much on their ho&s;pitality, genero&s;ity,
and fondne&s;s for men of parts and genius, and how greatly I might be admired
and promoted there on account of my learning, knowledge of languages and
&s;ciences, and for having al|ready travelled through &s;o many con&s;ider|able
parts of the world, all which he &s;aid was the more &s;urpri&s;ing, as I was
&s;till &s;o very young, for I was then hardly full &s;ix|teen years old. He
could not indeed have found a more effectual way than that of &s;oothing my
vanity, to make me give wholly into his views, and as to the objection of the
want of money, con&s;i|dering how well acquainted I was with the 
<PB N="134" REF="136"> way of travelling at free-co&s;t, he &s;aid I could not
but promi&s;e my&s;elf much better &s;ucce&s;s through tho&s;e countries, where
the peoples genero&s;ity was equal to their known opulence.</P>
<P>I was now (unknown to him) to think of &s;ome more cunning,
&s;afe, and effectual way of travelling than that I had followed in my two
former journies; and &s;ince I found that my pa&s;&s;ing for an Iri&s;hman and
a &s;ufferer for religion, did not only expo&s;e me to the danger of being
di&s;co|vered, but came &s;hort of the merit and admiration I had expected from
it, I re|&s;olved on a new project, which, though equally hazardous, I had not
&s;en&s;e enough to fore&s;ee, and tho' &s;till more di&s;hone&s;t, I had not
virtue enough to deter me from. I &s;ay, unknown to my father, for I had
carefully concealed all the vile indirect pretences I had already u&s;ed, and
much more was I now obliged to do &s;o, know|ing him to be &s;o upright and
religious a man, that I &s;hould not only have incurred his utmo&s;t anger, but
that he would like|wi&s;e have taken all po&s;&s;ible means to have deterred me
from, or di&s;appointed me in <PB N="135" REF="137"> it. I recollected, that
whil&s;t I was learn|ing humanity, rhetoric and geography with the Je&s;uits, I
had heard them &s;peak of the Ea&s;t-Indies, China, Japan, &amp;c. and
ex|patiate much in prai&s;e of tho&s;e countries, and the ingenuity of the
inhabitants. The idea they had given us of them was indeed too general and
imperfect, at lea&s;t what I remembered of it, was by far too &s;hort and
confu&s;ed, for a per&s;on of the lea&s;t pru|dence or foreca&s;t to have built
&s;uch a wild project upon, becau&s;e all the notion they had given us of it,
was only from their maps and comments upon them, for they made u&s;e of
geographical books. However, I was ra&s;h enough to think, that what I wanted
of a right knowledge of them, I might make up by the &s;trength of a pregnant
invention, in which I flat|tered my&s;elf I might &s;ucceed the more ea&s;ily,
as I &s;uppo&s;ed they were &s;o little known by the generality of Europeans,
that they were only looked upon, in the lump, to be Antipodes to them in
almo&s;t every re&s;pect, as religion, manners, dre&s;s, &amp;c. This was my
crude notion of the matter, which I thought afforded a va&s;t 
<PB N="136" REF="138"> &s;cope to a fertile fancy to work upon, and I had no
mi&s;tru&s;t of my&s;elf on that head. I had likewi&s;e heard that their way of
writ|ing differed very much from ours, but how, and in what, I was altogether
igno|rant, or had quite forgot it, and &s;o took it into my head, that like the
Hebrew, and other oriental tongues I had heard of, they mu&s;t write from the
right to the left, and on this puerile &s;uppo&s;ition, I &s;et about
ex|cogitating of an alphabet that might an|&s;wer my purpo&s;e. Another thing
that &s;hewed my incon&s;iderate folly was, that tho' I could not but know that
the Greeks and Hebrews had particular names for their letters, it never came
once into my head to imitate them in that, as I had in the figures, powers,
&amp;c. of &s;ome of the letters on a &s;uppo&s;ition, that as they might flow
originally from the &s;ame fountain, &s;o they might be rea&s;onably imagined
to re|tain &s;till &s;ome kind of re&s;emblance. The truth is, my time was
&s;hort, and know|ledge in what I went about &s;o very &s;mall and confu&s;ed,
and what I did was by &s;tealth, and fear of being detected by my father; that
I was &s;oon after made &s;en&s;ible of my <PB N="137" REF="139"> want of
foreca&s;t, when I came to con|ver&s;e with proper judges, and found the
nece&s;&s;ity not only of inventing names for the letters, but to make
&s;everal amend|ments to my wild &s;cheme, as I became better acquainted with
tho&s;e Ea&s;tern coun|tries.</P>
<P>However, con&s;idering my tender years, &s;mall experience, and
other &s;uch di&s;ad|vantages, I have had &s;ince no &s;mall cau&s;e to wonder
how I could excogitate not only &s;uch an alphabet, and names of letters, but
likewi&s;e many other particulars e|qually difficult, &s;uch as a
con&s;iderable piece of a new language and grammar, a new divi&s;ion of the
year into twenty months, a new religion, &amp;c. and all out of my own head, in
order to &s;tuff them into that mo&s;t abominable romance which I publi&s;hed
&s;oon after my coming into Eng|land, and which occa&s;ioned &s;uch variety of
opinions concerning it, and its &s;hamele&s;s author; &s;ome thinking it above
the capa|city of &s;uch a young fellow to invent, and others believing it the
re&s;ult of long thought and contrivance. Alas, for me, my fancy was but too
fertile and ready for all &s;uch <PB N="138" REF="140"> things, when I &s;et
about them, and when any que&s;tion has been &s;tarted on a &s;udden, about
matters I was ever &s;o unprepared for, I &s;eldom found my&s;elf at a lo&s;s
for a quick an&s;wer, which, if &s;atisfactory, I &s;tored up in my retentive
memory. But to return to my alphabet, as &s;oon as I had fini&s;hed it to my
mind, I began to inure my hand to write it with &s;ome readine&s;s, that it
might upon occa&s;ion appear natural to me, which I found the more difficult,
as I never was expert at my pen, and was quite unu&s;ed to this backward way of
writing; and this obliged me to alter the form of &s;ome of them, for the more
ea&s;y tracing them with the pen, and to con|trive &s;ome abreviations and
joining of let|ters, and other &s;uch improvements for ex|pedition, which done,
I thought my&s;elf &s;ufficiently prepared for pa&s;&s;ing for a Japane&s;e
converted to Chri&s;tianity. The only difficulty was, how to reconcile this new
and vile a&s;&s;umption with my Avignon certificate, which was not to be done
but by copy|ing it anew, and altering it where I &s;aw fit, and clapping the
&s;eal from the origi|nal one to the counterfeit; but though I 
<PB N="139" REF="141"> was ready enough at wording it to my mind, I wrote &s;o
indifferent a hand, that it could never pa&s;s for that of a &s;ecretary of a
vice-legate, and to have had it done by a better penman was too difficult and
hazardous for me to venture. At length I thought it &s;afe&s;t to tru&s;t to my
copying it as well as I could, with its flouri&s;hes and ornaments, though I
did it in &s;uch a coar&s;e and clum&s;y manner, that it would hardly have
pa&s;&s;ed for a tolerable counterfeit. There was likewi&s;e another danger of
a di&s;|covery from the different marks and make of the German and Avignon
paper, but that never came then in my head; &s;o that having made what
alterations I thought proper in the tenor of the pa&s;s, and clap|ping the old
&s;eal to it, I made no difficulty to tru&s;t the re&s;t to fortune, and took a
melancholy leave of my poor father, who &s;hed abundance of tears over me, and
wi&s;hed me all po&s;&s;ible ble&s;&s;ings and &s;uc|ce&s;s, not dreaming how
little this new pro|ject of mine de&s;erved of either; and when I was got at
&s;ome di&s;tance from him, I put on my old pilgrim's habit, and began my
journey with a kind of heavy heart, <PB N="140" REF="142"> according to the
rout he had penned down for me, and which was quite oppo&s;ite to that which
would have brought me to my own home. I had, indeed, taken care to write to my
anxious mother, and to ac|quaint her with what had pa&s;&s;ed between my father
and me, and with my de&s;ire of taking a tour into the Low Countries be|fore I
returned to her, but I had afterwards rea&s;on to fear, that the melancholy
&s;tyle in which it was worded, did rather increa&s;e than mitigate her concern
for her now really worthle&s;s &s;on; for, from that time, neither &s;he, nor
yet my father, ever heard of me more, nor I of them, and, in all likelihood,
both of them have bewailed my lo&s;s at a much greater rate than I de|&s;erved,
if it did not prove the means of &s;hortening their days.</P>
<P>The reader may &s;ee by all this, what a ra&s;h and abandoned
fellow I was, how lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of religion, nature and rea|&s;on,
and how I expo&s;ed my&s;elf to &s;o many dangers, over head and ears, to
indulge a fa|vourite pa&s;&s;ion, and without the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of reaping
any benefit from it, or even aim|ing at it. However, this is nothing in
com|pari&s;on <PB N="141" REF="143"> of what is to follow, and it is ra|ther a
wonder that &s;o bad a beginning, &s;o ill concerted, and wor&s;e followed,
hath not had a more dreadful ending, and I can only a&s;cribe it to the
unde&s;erved mercy of God, that it did not end in my total ruin of body and
&s;oul. And I mu&s;t de&s;ire the reader to bear &s;till in mind the
con&s;i|deration of my tender years, and the di&s;|advantages of my wrong
education, if he intends to read what is to follow with any tolerable patience,
at lea&s;t till he comes to &s;ome more agreeable &s;cenes: In the mean time,
as I am now entering into One of the blacke&s;t &s;hame and guilt, I
&s;incerely pro|te&s;t, that it is the farthe&s;t from my heart to aggravate or
extenuate either, in order to render the following account more &s;ur|prizing
or agreeable, but to relate the whole with the &s;ame &s;incerity, as I
&s;hould be willing to do it, or wi&s;h it to have been done, at my la&s;t
moments. And I hope I &s;hall be the more readily believed, as I do not
de&s;ign to have it printed till after my death, when all &s;ini&s;ter views
will be quite taken away, and nothing be able to yield any &s;atisfaction on
the other &s;ide of the <PB N="142" REF="144"> grave, but the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its &s;incerity, e&s;pecially con&s;idering that I
&s;hall leave nei|ther children nor relations to reap any be|nefit from this
narrative. But to return to my propo&s;ed rout:</P>
<P>I was at fir&s;t to vi&s;it all the con&s;iderable cities on both
&s;ides of the Rhine, as they lay in my way to that of Cologn, whither I
pretended to go on a religious pilgrimage to the three kings, who&s;e remains
are &s;aid to be there interred in the cathedral<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e were the wi&s;e men that came to wor&s;hip our Infant
Saviour, and are, by the church of Rome, &s;tiled kings, and pretended to have
been only three, whom they call Ga&s;par, Melchior and Balthazar; the legend
adds, that upon their being warned not to return to Jeru&s;alem, they took the
way to Cologn, and died, and were buried there. Their heads are expo&s;ed in a
&s;tately &s;hrine be|hind the great altar every Wedne&s;day, and they &s;hew
you the gate by the Rhine-&s;ide, at which it is pretended they came in by, and
which hath been &s;ince walled. This Cathedral doth likewi&s;e contain a number
of other relicks, and miraculous pictures to feed the devotion of the vulgar,
and bring a con&s;tant concour&s;e of people thither.</NOTE>, to which there is
a great re&s;ort of devotees almo&s;t all the year: for the Germans are equally
fond of pilgrims that come to any of their great &s;aints, as the Italians are
of tho&s;e that come to Rome or Loretto, or <PB N="143" REF="145" MS="y"> the
Spaniards to tho&s;e that go to St. Jago de Compo&s;tella; &s;o that I did not
doubt of meeting with a kind reception wherever I came. I &s;hall not take up
the reader's time in de&s;cribing the places I came through, that being much
better done in books of travels; but only ob&s;erve, that I found them all in a
mo&s;t di&s;mal plight, mo&s;t of the fine buildings ruinated, noble palaces
with only the bare walls, half de|moli&s;hed, cathedrals, and other &s;tately
churches, built of the fine&s;t marble and other co&s;tly &s;tones finely
carved, battered half down, and nothing left fit for divine &s;ervice but the
choir or chancel, which in many places were quite unroofed, and only thatched
with &s;traw. All the re&s;t appear|ed in a &s;till more woeful condition,
where|ever the conquering arms of Lewis XIV. had penetrated, for this was but a
few years after the peace of Re&s;wick, &s;o that they had not had time to
recover them|&s;elves from the&s;e dreadful ravages.</P>
<P>An accident happened to me before I had gone far, which, had I
been le&s;s ra&s;h and incon&s;iderate, might have deterred me from pur&s;uing
my &s;ham pilgrimage farther. <PB N="144" REF="146"> It was at the city of
Landau, garri&s;on|ed by the French, and commanded by an old experienced
officer, and was then a very &s;trong place, and the la&s;t town they had in
Al&s;ace. The familiarity I was ob|&s;erved to carry on with &s;ome of the
infe|rior officers and &s;oldiers of the garri&s;on, who were plea&s;ed with
the whim&s;ical ac|count I gave of my&s;elf and my pretended country, made me
&s;u&s;pected of being a &s;py, and as &s;uch I was accordingly con|ducted by a
file of mu&s;queteers to the go|vernor, who, not being &s;atisfied with my
account, ordered me to be &s;ent to gaol, where I was at fir&s;t confined in a
noi&s;ome place for &s;ome hours, but afterwards ad|mitted to the liberty of
the pri&s;on till the next day, when I was conducted in the &s;ame manner out
of the city, and forbid, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties, to return into
it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In that fabulous account I give of my&s;elf,
prefixed to the hi&s;tory of Formo&s;a, I pretended to have been &s;eized here
for taking a plan of the fortifications of the place, which was ab&s;olutely
fal&s;e; for though I had done &s;o more than once in my native country, where
I could give no umbrage, I was not &s;o &s;tupid as to do &s;o in this; neither
was it con&s;i&s;tent with my &s;cheme to pretend to any &s;kill in drawing and
fortifications. However, as to the governor of the place it is mo&s;t likely
that my youth and &s;implicity moved his pity more than any credit he could
give to what I &s;aid for my&s;elf; for excepting my making a longer &s;tay in
it than is u&s;ual for pilgrims, there had been nothing &s;aid or done by me
that could give the jealou&s;y of my being a &s;py.</NOTE>. This dreadful
e&s;cape might, one <PB N="145" REF="147"> would think, have opened my eyes to
&s;ee the folly and danger of my ill-concerted &s;cheme, as well as reminded me
of my promi&s;e of returning to my poor anxious mother, if I did not think fit
to &s;tay with my father. But my religion and prudence were much of a piece,
ju&s;t &s;ufficient to make me apply my&s;elf to heaven in time of danger,
which was no &s;ooner blown over, but I as quickly forgot what I owed to
either, except that I looked on my&s;elf as obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the
church offices, &s;uch as ma&s;s, ve&s;pers, &amp;c. as often as opportunity
offered, which I continued do|ing till a more wicked and abominable project
made me leave it off. The&s;e par|ticulars may perhaps be thought too tri|fling
to my readers to be worthy in&s;erting, but to me they appear in a quite other
light, and do but too plainly &s;hew how naturally one mi&s;carriage draws on a
wor&s;e, <PB N="146" REF="148"> where religion and rea&s;on have unhappily
lo&s;t their influence, or yielded it to a predo|minant and ungovernable
pa&s;&s;ion, and how ea&s;ily the indulging of it will, by de|grees, come to
quench all remor&s;e and conviction, and unle&s;s the Divine Grace
interpo&s;es, hurry a man into utter perdi|tion. And as no man hath more
&s;en&s;ibly felt the &s;ad effects of the one, as well as the ble&s;&s;ed ones
of the other, what can I do le&s;s than acknowledge and adore that divine and
unde&s;erved mercy, to which a|lone I owe &s;o great, and I hope effectual,
deliverance? And what cau&s;e have I not to be, to the highe&s;t degree,
thankful that I had &s;uch early impre&s;&s;ions of religion inculcated into my
mind, and which tho' &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and &s;mothered for a long time, by the
violence of a favourite vice, did yet, in God's own time, bring me into a
&s;en&s;e and abhorrence of my pa&s;t follies, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, drove
me from the mo&s;t dreadful danger into the arms of a merciful and forgiving
Saviour, and that in &s;o wonderful and unhoped for a manner, that it was
impo&s;&s;ible for me to attribute <PB N="147" REF="149" MS="y"> the
ble&s;&s;ed change to any thing but to a &s;upernatural grace and mercy?</P>
<P>I &s;hall, however, in the &s;equel, be more &s;uccinct,
e&s;pecially in my account of what happened to me from Landau, to the fa|tal
time in which I was unwarily drawn into the mo&s;t abandoned piece of
impo&s;|ture, that of my pretended conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity by Dr. James,
then chaplain to a Scotch regiment garri&s;oned at Sluys; for to mention all
tho&s;e particulars would not only appear a mo&s;t &s;tupid and tedious, but an
almo&s;t incredible &s;eries of the mo&s;t unaccountable follies and
di&s;a&s;ters that any ra&s;h youth could fall into. It will be &s;uf|ficient
to &s;ay, that I travelled &s;everal hun|dred leagues through Germany, Brabant
and Flanders, under the notion of a Japa|ne&s;e converted to Chri&s;tianity by
&s;ome je&s;uit mi&s;&s;ionaries, and brought to Avig|non, by them to be
farther in&s;tructed, as well as to avoid the dreadful puni&s;hment inflicted
on all that turn Chri&s;tians in the dominions of the emperor of Japan. In
pur&s;uance of which &s;hameful pretence, I kept up an outward form or
religion, was frequent at church, and was &s;ometimes <PB N="148" REF="150">
affected with tho&s;e duties, and, at other times, pinched with a tran&s;ient
remor&s;e and &s;hame at the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the wicked part I was then
acting. My fluency in the Latin tongue, and &s;mattering of other branches of
learn|ing, e&s;pecially logic, philo&s;ophy and the|ology, of which my
tenacious memory &s;till pre&s;erved &s;ome of the mo&s;t curious parts, joined
to the flagrant account I gave of my&s;elf, procured me, indeed, more re|gard
and a greater &s;hare of beneficence, than was commonly &s;hewed to other
tra|vellers or pilgrims, but my carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and extravagance not
&s;uffering me to lay out any money in dre&s;s, or even linnen, to keep me
clean and decent, I, by degrees, made &s;o di&s;mal and &s;habby an appearance,
that I outdid the very common beggars, and this misfortune brought on wor&s;e
upon me. For fir&s;t, it gave &s;uch an ill face and di&s;credit to all my
pretences, as all my learning could not counterbalance; and 2dly, when I came
into &s;ome con&s;iderable cities, which I was de&s;irous to &s;ee, and where
they have ho&s;pitals for pilgrims and &s;trangers, with &s;uitable
accommodations according to their rank, appearance, or re|commendation, 
<PB N="149" REF="151"> commendation, I &s;hewed, in vain, my counterfeit
pa&s;s, which, if I had been in a better trim, would, from the advantageous
manner in which I had dre&s;&s;ed it, have procured a much better reception;
tho&s;e who attend on &s;uch occa&s;ions would &s;el|dom give them&s;elves the
trouble of read|ing it, though I begged of them &s;o to do, but, taking it for
granted, that I was one of the lowe&s;t rank, or de&s;erving to be treated as
&s;uch, did generally herd me a|mong the meane&s;t, by which I &s;aw my|&s;elf
in a &s;hort time covered with rags and vermine, and infected with a mo&s;t
virulent itch. This di&s;mal plight, one would have thought &s;ufficient, to
rou&s;e me from my &s;en&s;ele&s;s lethargy, and make me follow the example of
the returning prodigal, e&s;pe|cially, as I found, to my great mortification,
that all my fair &s;hew of learning, made me appear now only the more
de&s;picable in the eyes of the &s;oberer part; for how could even tho&s;e, who
gave any credit to what I told them, forbear &s;uppo&s;ing that I mu&s;t have
been guilty of &s;ome great enormity, or el&s;e the Je&s;uits, by whom I
pretended to have been brought out of Japan into <PB N="150" REF="152">
Avignon, would never have given me up to &s;o &s;hameful a vagabond life; and
no doubt but the far greater part believed it all a forgery, though they did
not think it worth the while to have me called to an account for it. Thus did I
find my affairs grow from bad to wor&s;e, in&s;omuch that I was often pinched
with want, and glad would I have been to have returned home to my mother; but
the thought of my pre|&s;ent condition would not permit me to think of it, and,
perhaps, I could have preferred any death to &s;o great a morti|fication as it
would have been both to her and me. I have, however, had rea&s;on to think it a
mercy that I had &s;uch an inve|terate itch, added to all my other
misfor|tunes, for I perceived that in &s;everal great cities of Brabant and
Flanders, there are a &s;ort of procure&s;&s;es, who wander about the &s;treets
under the character of Begines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The true Begines are a
good &s;ort of unmarried wo|men, who dedicate them&s;elves to works of charity;
but in&s;tead of being cloi&s;tered up like the nuns, vi&s;it the hou&s;es of
the poorer &s;ort, and procure them all proper relief from the charitable rich.
They likewi&s;e extend their care to the &s;ick, lame, pri&s;oners and
&s;trangers, and are known by a particular plain dre&s;s, not unlike that of
the nuns. But there are al&s;o many vile women, who, under the cloak of that
dre&s;s and character, carry on the trade of procure&s;&s;es, and are but too
commonly encouraged and &s;upported in it, by the profligate rich and
great.</NOTE>, <PB N="151" REF="153"> and pick up all the likely fellows they
meet with, in order to make a lewd trade of them; and I being then very young,
&s;anguine, and likely in per&s;on, have now and then been invited and led by
them in a &s;eeming ho&s;pitable manner, to &s;ome cha|ritable ladies to
receive, as was pretended, &s;ome token of their genero&s;ity, but, in reality,
to return a le&s;s commendable one to the benefactre&s;s. But my di&s;temper,
whether or no it was imagined to be of a wor&s;e kind than it was, proved
&s;uch a di&s;gu&s;tful bar, that I never was put to the trial, otherwi&s;e I
am &s;ure neither my vir|tue nor prudence would have been proof again&s;t it;
for though I was then ab&s;olutely innocent of any criminal commerce with any
of the &s;ex, yet, circum&s;tanced as I was, I have rea&s;on to believe I
&s;hould ea&s;ily have yielded at any hazard, and this fur|ther con&s;ideration
made me &s;till more weary of my wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="154">I was at length come to the celebrated city
of Liege, and &s;tayed &s;ome time there, to view all the curio&s;ities of the
place, and at night took up my lodging at the ho&s;pital, where we were
likewi&s;e allowed &s;ome kind of &s;upper. There I was informed that an
officer was arrived at one of the &s;uburbs belonging to the Dutch, who
inli&s;ted peo|ple into the Dutch &s;ervice, and gave good encouragement to
&s;uch vagrants as appear|ed fit to carry a mu&s;ket. I had no great hopes that
I &s;hould pa&s;s mu&s;ter with him, being both too young and &s;hort, as I
thought, for his purpo&s;e: however, I re|&s;olved to try, and &s;oon
per&s;uaded half a dozen of my fellow ragamuffians to follow me; but as nobody
could have a greater aver&s;ion than I to a &s;oldier's life, by what I had
&s;een at my native place, where was always kept a &s;trong garri&s;on, I began
to wi&s;h I might meet with a repul&s;e. The re&s;t were pre&s;ently inli&s;ted
by the pretend|ed officer, for he only bought them to &s;ell them again; but
when he came to me, and had heard my patched up &s;tory, in|&s;tead of
&s;eeming di&s;couraged from taking &s;uch a raw and tender boy, he really, to 
<PB N="153" REF="155"> my great &s;urprize, &s;hewed me an uncom|mon regard,
tho' I made the wor&s;t figure of any of his recruits; and I could by no means
conceive the rea&s;on of it till near a month after, during which time we were
well entertained at an inn, wanting for neither victuals nor drink. He &s;oon
ob|&s;erved me to be aver&s;e to &s;trong liquors, and indulged me in it. At
length, having &s;old away all his recruits but me, he began to tell me that he
had too great a regard for me, to &s;end me with them to carry a brown
mu&s;ket, and that he de&s;igned &s;ome|thing better for me, and more
&s;uitable to my education; but that he mu&s;t fir&s;t try to get me cured of
the &s;cabious di&s;ea&s;e, which by that time had &s;pread it&s;elf all over
my &s;kin. Accordingly he tried all proper medicines, got me phy&s;icked,
a|nointed, blooded, bathed, &amp;c. but with|out &s;ucce&s;s. Being at length
obliged to return to his then home, he got me hand|&s;omely equipt, and took me
to Aix-la-Chapelle, where I found he kept a grand coffee-hou&s;e, and
billiards, and other games, in the mo&s;t hand&s;ome part of the city, over
again&s;t the town-hall, and here I <PB N="154" REF="156"> was to wait on the
cu&s;tomers, and to teach a boy of his to read, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I had rea&s;on to believe that my new-ma&s;ter had conceived hopes
that I &s;hould bring a good number of cu&s;tomers to his hou&s;e; and, as for
my&s;elf, I ex|pected to find no &s;mall &s;atisfaction in be|ing &s;een, and
&s;uffered to di&s;play my parts among them. But we found our&s;elves both
di&s;appointed, in a great mea&s;ure, be|cau&s;e, tho' it was then the heighth
of the &s;ea&s;on for drinking the waters, and the town was full of people; yet
the greate&s;t part of them were &s;eldom to be &s;een any where but at the
pump, and the walks about it, and the&s;e were at another and di&s;tant part of
the town; &s;o that there was hard|ly any re&s;orted to his coffee-hou&s;e,
except gentlemen that came thither to &s;pend an hour or two at billiards,
backgammon, ba&s;|&s;et, or &s;ome other game, and the&s;e were men of little
or no ta&s;te for learning, ex|cept two or three French refugees, who appeared
to me to be profe&s;&s;ed game&s;ters. The&s;e, and now and then &s;ome German
gentlemen, that dropped in by chance, would conde&s;cend to divert them&s;elves
<PB N="155" REF="157"> with my company, que&s;tion me about variety of things,
and hold an argument with me about &s;ome curious or in&s;tructing &s;ubject,
and at their going away commonly left &s;ome marks of their genero&s;ity,
which, however, my ma&s;ter gave me to under&s;tand, I was to be contented with
&s;uch a &s;hare of as he &s;hould plea&s;e to allow me.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides his coffee-hou&s;e, he furni&s;hed the balls, and other
places of that re&s;ort, with lemonade, orgeat, and other cooling li|quors
proper for the &s;ea&s;on, as well as with variety of drams for &s;uch as liked
them. And here it was that I beheld the beau monde in &s;uch extraordinary
&s;plen|dor, as was like to have been of the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equence to me,
and to have drove me to the mo&s;t de&s;perate piece of folly and madne&s;s
that a man in his &s;en&s;es could have been guilty of, and which I &s;hall
forbear mentioning, merely for the ill im|pre&s;&s;ion it might be apt to make
on &s;ome weak and &s;ceptical minds; but which, while I live, I &s;hall never
forget, nor cea&s;e ble&s;&s;ing the divine mercy which kept me back from it.
And it was well for me that I was &s;ent thither but once more, tho' 
<PB N="156" REF="158"> another man he kept, much older and fitter for the
bu&s;ine&s;s, was obliged to give daily attendance there; and I can only think
that my cuticular di&s;ea&s;e, which di&s;|played it&s;elf too vi&s;ibly in my
hands, was the cau&s;e why I was &s;o &s;eldom &s;ent thi|ther.</P>
<P>Before the &s;ea&s;on was over, my ma&s;ter, who had other irons

lea&s;t one who pa&s;&s;ed for &s;uch there, had run him&s;elf pretty deep in
his debt, by &s;ome grand entertainments he had given on &s;everal occa&s;ions;
and it was now whi&s;pered about, that he was ju&s;t on the point of
di&s;appearing. My mi&s;tre&s;s, upon the fir&s;t hint of it, told me I mu&s;t
immediately &s;et out and fetch her hu&s;band. The time was &s;o &s;hort, and
the way &s;o long and difficult, con&s;idering that I was to go on foot, that
there was &s;carcely any probability of my reaching the place time enough, and
much le&s;s &s;o, con&s;idering I was a &s;tranger to the road and to the

my&s;elf from it, and have per&s;uaded her to have di&s;patched a man and
hor&s;e to him, but &s;he was a haughty dame, and above being advi&s;ed, &s;o
that I was forced to comply, though without any hopes of getting there time
enough, in which ca&s;e it would be of no &s;ervice to him, e&s;peci|ally if I
&s;hould chance to lo&s;e my way, of which there was &s;o much the more danger,
as it was very intricate, and I knew not a &s;tep of it, nor how to be
in|formed about it, for want of the German tongue. And indeed, though I took
all the care I could, I found before I was got half way to the place, that it
would be impo&s;&s;ible for me to avoid being &s;o often out, through the
various windings and turnings, and cro&s;s-roads I frequently met with, that I
de&s;paired of reaching it in double the time. The anxiety and fear I was in
was &s;o great, about the reception I &s;hould meet with, both from him and her
for my &s;ucceeding &s;o ill, that I began to think of preventing it, by giving
them both the &s;lip. My heart, however, he&s;i|tated a good while, and
upbraided me with the ingratitude and inju&s;tice I was <PB N="158" REF="160">
going to be guilty of, as likewi&s;e with the danger I might incur, &s;hould I
be caught afterwards by him; for in &s;uch a ca&s;e, I mu&s;t have expected
nothing le&s;s than the highe&s;t marks of his re&s;entment. But when I
con&s;idered, on the other hand, that all my care and diligence could not bring
me to him time enough, and that I &s;hould be ill treated for that which I
could not avoid, I preferred a di&s;tant danger to one &s;eemingly at hand; and
being then ju&s;t going to cro&s;s a high road, which I was told led to the
city of Cologn, immediately took to it, with a re&s;olution to return to my
father, and then to my mother, by the &s;ame way I had formerly gone. This
la&s;t con&s;ideration was then &s;trong with me, as it revived in my mind the
concern and grief they mu&s;t be in about me, e&s;pecially my poor mother, who
had heard nothing from me &s;ince that melancholy letter I &s;ent to her upon
leaving my father. The thoughts of &s;eeing again two &s;uch dear pa|rents, had
&s;o enlivened me, that it had in a great mea&s;ure effaced all other
reflec|tions, particularly the remor&s;e of my in|gratitude to my late
ma&s;ter. But here I <PB N="159" REF="161"> was again di&s;appointed, not only
of that happine&s;s, but even from the very pro&s;|pect and hopes of it, and
that ju&s;tly too, and by my own &s;tupid folly. And &s;ince the Divine
Providence had &s;o wonderfully de|livered me from the dangers and mi&s;eries
of a &s;oldier's life, by in&s;piring my ma&s;ter with &s;entiments, whether of
gain or pity, or both, and I had made &s;uch ungrateful re|turns, both to God
and him, it was but ju&s;t I &s;hould plunge my&s;elf into the mi|&s;ery and
danger I was &s;o unworthy to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>I had already pa&s;&s;ed through Cologn, and Bon the re&s;idence
of the elector of Co|logn, and got to another city of his elec|torate
likewi&s;e on the Rhine, when upon my entering it at one of the gates, I was
acco&s;ted by a per&s;on genteely dre&s;&s;ed, who, among &s;everal other
que&s;tions, a&s;ked me if I was willing to enter into that elector's
&s;ervice, and u&s;ed &s;ome of the u&s;ual topicks to induce me to it. I was
&s;urpri&s;ed at his que&s;tion, and readily enough an&s;wered in the negative,
but was &s;oon after per|&s;uaded by him to accept his offer, tho' without the
lea&s;t force or circumvention, <PB N="160" REF="162"> and merely by my own
weakne&s;s and &s;tu|pidity, or rather &s;ome judicial fatality, for nothing
le&s;s than that I &s;hould think could have made me alter the laudable
re&s;olution I had taken, or &s;o ea&s;ily &s;et a&s;ide the thoughts of
revi&s;iting and reviv|ing two &s;uch dear and afflicted parents once more,
after I was got &s;o far in the way to it; but this was not the only misfortune
that attended this ra&s;h and unnatural action, which rather proved the fatal
&s;ource of new &s;cenes of mi&s;eries and wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>The liberty that is commonly granted to &s;oldiers to &s;wear,
game, drink, whore, &amp;c. is very great among the Germans, and much more
among the French; the&s;e la&s;t may be ju&s;tly affirmed to be the mo&s;t
profligate of any I ever have known or read of. There is no crime or lewdne&s;s
they will not commit, no oaths or cur&s;es &s;o terrible they will not delight
in. They &s;eem de&s;titute of all &s;en&s;e of religion and
&s;hamefacedne&s;s, and &s;o wholly carele&s;s a|bout a future &s;tate, that I
have &s;een many of them go to the gallows for de&s;ertion with as much
unconcern, and &s;ome of them <PB N="161" REF="163"> with a &s;eeming
jocundity, as if they were mounting the guard; and not one of them did I ever
ob&s;erve to &s;hew the lea&s;t &s;ign or repentance, fear of death, or concern
about another life. Tho&s;e we had in this regi|ment were, if po&s;&s;ible,
&s;till wor&s;e, being mo&s;tly de&s;erters from the French &s;ervice, and to
the la&s;t degree profligate: and if there was any one among them that was more
&s;oberly or religiou&s;ly inclined, he was &s;ure to become the object of
their &s;corn and contempt, and to be baited like &s;ome wicked or mon&s;trous
creature, a va&s;t num|ber of which we had in this regiment; and the&s;e,
coming to be intermixed with a number of raw young German recruits, taken
&s;ome from the plough and cart, others from their trades, and &s;ome even from
the Univer&s;ities, did debauch them into all manner of wickedne&s;s. This was
the un|happy herd I was now got among, and who&s;e company and example
compleated my ruin, by extingui&s;hing tho&s;e few faint traces of religion I
had left. I was indeed neither inclined to drinking nor gaming, and was not
hardened enough in impu|dence to follow them in their lewdne&s;s; 
<PB N="162" REF="164"> but was bad enough, neverthele&s;s, to in|dulge
my&s;elf, in order to appear as vile and abandoned as they, in a &s;hameful
habit of uttering &s;uch new and fa&s;hionable oaths, and mon&s;trous cur&s;es,
as I had lately rather heard with horror, than learn|ed, at Aix-la-Chapelle;
and as I was &s;till as ambitious as ever to pa&s;s for a Japone&s;e, cho&s;e
to profe&s;s my&s;elf an unconverted or heatheni&s;h one, rather than what I
had then pretended to be, a convert to Chri|&s;tianity. My vanity &s;oon made
me begin to make an aukward je&s;t and ridicule of the mo&s;t &s;olemn and
&s;acred truths of the Go&s;|pel, and to take a bruti&s;h delight at the
&s;urprize which the more &s;ober people of the town I conver&s;ed with,
expre&s;&s;ed at my bla&s;phemous and prophane expre&s;&s;ions and objections,
as well as in the plea&s;ure I ob&s;erved this gave to my fellow-&s;oldiers, or
rather fellow-brutes.</P>
<P>As the former had ob&s;erved me to be, in all other re&s;pects, a
&s;ober young fellow, given to no vice; and found me likewi&s;e ma&s;ter of
&s;ome &s;en&s;e and learning, they began to expre&s;s an uncommon
compa&s;&s;ion for me, and, believing me a heathen in|deed, 
<PB N="163" REF="165"> propo&s;ed to me to enter the li&s;ts with &s;ome of
their learned prie&s;ts or monks, who, they doubted not, would ea&s;ily
con|vince me of my error and danger; tho' they them&s;elves had not been able
to do it. It can hardly be doubted, but &s;uch a vain abandoned fellow as I
was, would readily accept the offer. To have declin|ed, would have betrayed a
diffidence I was not capable of; &s;o that I plea&s;ed my&s;elf with having a
fair opportunity of di&s;play|ing my parts and learning again&s;t my
an|tagoni&s;ts, and either to &s;tand proof again&s;t all their arguments, or
yield my&s;elf con|vinced by them, according as I &s;hould find it &s;uit
be&s;t with my vanity or intere&s;t; for if I found it worth my while to
chu&s;e the latter, I thought I &s;hould appear to the world as a convert of
uncommon &s;ize, and gain no &s;mall applau&s;e by it. There was but one thing
could make me he&s;i|tate about it, viz. the horrid guilt I &s;hould plunge
my&s;elf into by &s;uch a vile piece of hypocri&s;y, and I own it made &s;ome
im|pre&s;&s;ion upon my mind; but it proved &s;hort-lived, and my own
&s;anguine temper &s;oon got the ma&s;tery of it, and I at length 
<PB N="164" REF="166"> con&s;ented to be introduced to a Capuchin of that city,
who was e&s;teemed a man of great piety as well as learning, and who had been
appri&s;ed before of the intended vi&s;it, and the purport of it.</P>
<P>When we came to the mona&s;tery, we found the good old capuchin
&s;itting on a bench, in an outward room of it, facing the gate, with a lu&s;ty
young woman kneeling before him, barking like a dog, and making a great many
other antick noi&s;es and po&s;tures; upon which I was told that &s;he was
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and that the good father was exorci&s;ing the evil &s;pirit
out of her. Whether &s;he was then &s;ent for on purpo&s;e, or came by
accident, I know not; but I remembred to have &s;een her at &s;ome
proce&s;&s;ions, and once or twice at church, in the &s;ame unaccount|able
attitudes; and, as I was then weak enough to think it a real
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, from her extravagant actions and words, I be|gan to fear,
&s;o great is the power of guilt on &s;ome occa&s;ions, that the devil might
either expo&s;e me for the vile part I was then acting, or perhaps do me &s;ome
other and wor&s;e mi&s;chief, as he had formerly <PB N="165" REF="167"> done to
tho&s;e vagabond exorci&s;ts of whom we read Acts xix. 16. to avoid which I
withdrew as &s;oon as I decently could, as if to leave him to go on with his
exorci&s;m. Whether he took it in this &s;en&s;e or not, I know not; but at our
next meeting, when &s;he was out of the way, he took occa&s;ion from thence to
prove the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion in general, and of the church of
Rome in particular; and that her prie&s;ts alone have the power of ca&s;ting
out devils. I told him, with a &s;mile, that it would be time enough to
in&s;i&s;t on the mi|racle, or enquire into the reality of it, when it was
actually performed; to which he replied, with an air of great pity and
&s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s, that God did frequently permit &s;uch poor creatures to be
tormented for &s;ome time, before he vouch&s;afed them a deliverance; but that
tho' exorci&s;ms and prayers would not avail till then, yet they were obliged
in charity to make u&s;e of them, in hopes that they would one time or other
prove &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>As we came to enter into other arguments, I found that the good
old Capuchin was better provided for a controver&s;y again&s;t 
<PB N="166" REF="168"> Prote&s;tants than again&s;t heathens, which gave me no
&s;mall advantage again&s;t him; and this I took with &s;uch an a&s;&s;uming
air, and lightne&s;s of mind, that could not but be di&s;plea&s;ing to him;
this was &s;o na|tural to me, that I never could forbear di&s;|playing it upon
all &s;uch occa&s;ions, and no wonder if it gave them great cau&s;e to think me
either not &s;erious enough for the momentou&s;ne&s;s of the di&s;pute, or
per|haps rather that I was nothing le&s;s than what I pretended to be. I cannot
indeed recollect, that any thing like this la&s;t was their real judgment of
me, from any thing that dropped from them, though it was but too vi&s;ible to
be the ca&s;e, if their cha|rity did not blind their judgment in my favour;
however, I could &s;ee plainly e|nough from their unea&s;ine&s;s, that they
were not likely to be very forward in repeat|ing our conferences, and I was
vain e|nough to impute it to my being an over|match for them in the di&s;pute.
And it was in the &s;ame vain boa&s;ting &s;train, that I affirmed in that
fabulous account I gave of my&s;elf in England, that I was di&s;charg|ed out of
that &s;ervice for being a heathen, <PB N="167" REF="169"> and for refu&s;ing
to yield to the arguments of tho&s;e who had attempted to convert me. The
a&s;&s;umption was ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, and I was di&s;charged by order of the
colonel, becau&s;e I was not only below the &s;tandard, but al&s;o too tender
for the fatigues of a &s;ol|dier's life. And indeed I cannot expre&s;s the
mi&s;eries we underwent in the &s;ervice of that prince, who was then &s;o
eminently poor, that great numbers of his troops pe|ri&s;hed for want of
cloaths, fewel, and e|ven of bread; and had I not been treated with greater
care and tenderne&s;s than mo&s;t of the re&s;t were, mu&s;t inevitably have
pe|ri&s;hed in a very hard winter at Bon, where, be&s;ides the want of all
other ne|ce&s;&s;aries, the greate&s;t part of the garri&s;on were quartered in
barracks open to all winds and weather, and forced to lie on the bare
boards.</P>
<P>Being thus happily di&s;charged from &s;o dreadful a &s;lavery, it
was natural for me to think once more of returning to my long-wi&s;hed-for
home, at any rate, and at all hazards; but here likewi&s;e my ill fate had laid
an unexpected ob&s;tacle, which it was not in my power to remove; for my late 
<PB N="168" REF="170"> captain, a &s;ordid wretch, who had been rai&s;ed to his
po&s;t from that of a common centinel, by the ba&s;e&s;t means, had taken
tho&s;e cloaths I had brought from Aix-la-Chapelle under his care, and, as he
pre|tended, to prevent my &s;elling them, and &s;pending the money; but upon my
being di&s;charged, refu&s;ed to re&s;tore them to me, though he &s;tripped me
of my ammunition ones, and had the con&s;cience to &s;end me away in the heart
of a &s;evere winter, with a bare loo&s;e old frock of blue linnen, and without
wai&s;tcoat or &s;hoes to my feet, for tho&s;e he gave me were
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o worn out that my feet touched the
ground, &s;o that I could never have travelled far before the hardne&s;s of the
weather would have made an end of me. This made me re&s;olve to go back to
Cologn, and try how far my di&s;mal plight and fluent tongue would work upon
peoples charity; but it being then war|time, I was &s;topped, as is u&s;ual in
garri|&s;oned cities, at the gate, and conducted to the main guard, to give an
account of my&s;elf to the officer then on duty. I did &s;o, and lighted on a
per&s;on, who was really a gentleman, and took &s;uch liking 
<PB N="169" REF="171"> to me, that I li&s;ted my&s;elf in his company, and was
pre&s;ently after &s;upplied with cloaths fitter for the &s;ea&s;on. I
pa&s;&s;ed to him for a Japone&s;e and a heathen, and was entered in his
company under the name of Salmanazar, which, &s;ince my coming into England, I
altered, by the addition of a letter or two, to make it &s;omewhat different
from that mentioned in the book of Kings, but whether my new captain believed
what I told him or not, I be|came no &s;mall favourite of his. He was a man of
good &s;en&s;e, &s;poke Latin and French well, and had &s;ome good &s;cholars
in his company, one or two of them of the church of Rome, whereas the regi|ment
con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;tly of Lutherans, it be|longing to the duke of Mecklenburg,
but was then in the Dutch pay, and garri&s;oned at Cologn.</P>
<P>That great city is, perhaps, one of the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious
in all Germany; every &s;treet and every hou&s;e hath the &s;tatue or image of
&s;ome &s;aint or other, to which they light candles at night, but mo&s;tly to
that of the Virgin Mary. Our Lutherans, in &s;pight of all prohibitions from
the ma|gi&s;tracy, <PB N="170" REF="172"> could not forbear &s;hewing their
di&s;like and contempt to the&s;e, and many other &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;toms
they beheld, and were &s;ometimes puni&s;hed for it. Yet did not this deter me
from taking pride in outdoing them, though I was &s;o far from having the
&s;ame laudable pretence for it, that in my heart I condemned them for their
untimely zeal, and my&s;elf for my impious vanity. We had likewi&s;e &s;everal
loo&s;e gentlemen brought up in &s;ome of the be&s;t univer&s;ities, who had
been prevailed upon to exchange their gowns and books for a musket; &s;ome of
them were Prote&s;t|ants, others Papi&s;ts, and with the&s;e our chief officers
delighted to &s;et me on di&s;|puting, by which I had gained their ill will
&s;o far, as I generally proved too hard for them, that they had &s;tigmatized
me with the titles of heathen, infidel unbap|tized, and the like; but the&s;e,
in&s;tead of giving me any unea&s;ine&s;s or remor&s;e, ra|ther &s;oothed my
pride, and made me now and then, upon a proper occa&s;ion, take de|light to
remind them that I could give better rea&s;ons for my being &s;o, than they
could for them&s;elves. My captain think|ing <PB N="171" REF="173"> that our
chaplain, who had been brought up a regular clergyman in the Lutheran way,
might &s;ucceed better with me, propo&s;ed a conference to him; but he being a
ba&s;hful young gentleman, mode&s;tly declined it, and con|tented him&s;elf
with expo&s;ing the folly and ab&s;urdity of the heatheni&s;h religion in
&s;ome of his &s;ermons, where he had a large field to expatiate on, without
the danger of oppo&s;ition. I was afterwards introduced to two others, one who
&s;erved the Lutheran meeting at Cologn (for they tolerate Prote&s;tant
meetings in time of war for the u&s;e of the garri&s;on, though they &s;hut
them up in time of peace) and the other a man of great learning, at a &s;mall
di&s;tance from the city. Our di&s;putes proved but of &s;hort duration, I
always attacking them upon &s;uch points, as I knew they were the lea&s;t able
to defend, but by Scripture, which I pretended not to believe, but urged even
tho&s;e very points, &s;uch as the Trinity, Con&s;ub&s;tanti|ation, &amp;c. as
arguments again&s;t it; and this, as well as my vain and a&s;&s;uming
be|haviour, might ea&s;ily rai&s;e a di&s;like, if not <PB N="172" REF="174">
more likely, a mi&s;tru&s;t of me. One thing I had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve,
that where Papi&s;ts and Prote&s;tants are &s;o intermin|gled, their guides are
better &s;tored with arguments again&s;t each other, than a|gain&s;t the common
enemies of the Chri&s;tian faith.</P>
<P>From Cologn we were ordered into Hol|land by the next &s;pring,
and began to encamp as &s;oon as the campaign began. The Lutherans and
Calvini&s;ts had prayers morning and night at the head of every regiment, and a
&s;ermon on Sundays, and I was vain enough to go from one to the other to
ob&s;erve their method of devotion, and &s;inging of p&s;alms and hymns, at
which they both behaved with great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s: but as for me, after
li&s;tening awhile to them, I was commonly driven by my ra&s;h|ne&s;s and
vanity to turn my back to them, and turning my face to the ri&s;ing or
&s;et|ting &s;un, to make &s;ome aukward &s;hew of wor&s;hip, or praying to it,
and was no le&s;s plea&s;ed to be taken notice of for &s;o doing. This vain fit
grew up to &s;uch a height, that I made me a little book with figures of the
&s;un, moon and &s;tars, <PB N="173" REF="175"> and &s;uch other imagery as my
phren&s;y &s;ugge&s;ted to me, and filled the re&s;t with a kind of gibberi&s;h
pro&s;e and ver&s;e, writ|ten in my invented character, and which I muttered or
chanted as often as the hu|mour took me.</P>
<P>I have often ju&s;tly wondered at the &s;ingu|lar goodne&s;s of
God to &s;uch a vile aban|doned wretch as I was become by this time, that in
neither regiment, in which I had continued, as I remember, about two years,
during which a &s;harp and &s;e|vere war was carried on with equal
fierce|ne&s;s, it never was my lot to be com|manded to a &s;iege, battle,
party, &s;kirmi&s;h, or place of danger, in which I might have been &s;uddenly
cut off in the mid&s;t of a mo&s;t impious career; or, what is equally
&s;urpri&s;ing, that the apprehen&s;ion of &s;o dreadful an end, &s;hould not
have deterred me from &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s and wicked a cour&s;e, and made me
feel the mon&s;trous &s;tupidity of running &s;uch de&s;perate hazards of body
and &s;oul, for the &s;ake of a little popular admiration at the be&s;t; but,
in&s;tead of which, I have more frequently met with mortification and contempt.
But I was <PB N="174" REF="176" MS="y"> &s;till very young, to the be&s;t of my
remem|brance not above eighteen, if quite &s;o much; my mind mi&s;guided by a
wrong education, as I have before ob&s;erved; con&s;cious of my own want of any
real merit, and yet fond to exce&s;s for any kind of pretence to it; and &s;o
de&s;irous of being admired and taken notice of, that, rather than have
foregone that favourite pa&s;&s;ion, I would have cho&s;en to indulge it, I
verily believe at that time, at the hazard and expence of being looked upon as
the very vile&s;t fellow that ever lived. As for tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions of
religion which I had &s;o &s;trongly imbibed in my youth, they gradually lo&s;t
their influence in proportion to my giving way to that de&s;tructive
pa&s;|&s;ion, and, at the be&s;t, were more in my head than in my heart, till
it plea&s;ed the divine grace to tran&s;plant them thither, as the propere&s;t
&s;oil for their fructifying; but this ble&s;&s;ing did not come down to me
till after &s;everal years, and a variety of &s;cenes of impiety and guilt. I
&s;hall pa&s;s by the other occurrences of my &s;oldier's life, to come to that
fatal one which proved the <PB N="175" REF="177"> &s;ource of new and more
horrid offences again&s;t God and man.</P>
<P>The la&s;t garri&s;on I came to was at Sluys, where was a French
and a Scotch regi|ment in the Dutch pay. There I &s;oon be|came acquainted with
&s;everal of the French officers, who&s;e language I perfectly under|&s;tood;
but as I was wholly unacquainted with the Scotch and Engli&s;h, and few of them
could &s;peak Latin, I could not be &s;o conver&s;ant with them. I found mo&s;t
of tho&s;e French gentlemen very &s;uperficial, and did not a little indulge my
vanity in ridiculing their tenets, whether they were Papi&s;ts or
Prote&s;tants, for there was a mix|ture of them, and had occa&s;ion to
ob&s;erve (tho' to my &s;hame, had I had the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of the vile part
I played) that, tho' the greater number of them were given to &s;uch flagrant
vices as are but too common among gentlemen of that profe&s;&s;ion; yet they
all appeared &s;o firmly attached to the tenets of their particular churches,
that they expre&s;&s;ed much more unea&s;ine&s;s at tho&s;e &s;arca&s;ms I
u&s;ed to throw out, than they did at the mo&s;t dreadful oaths they commonly
&s;wore, or any vices that <PB N="176" REF="178"> reigned among them. And as I
&s;till kept my&s;elf untainted from the latter, and had long ago broke
my&s;elf of that horrid one of &s;wearing, which I had taken up on my fir&s;t
entrance into the &s;oldier's life (not &s;o much indeed out of a principle of
religion, as from an ambition I had of pa&s;&s;ing for a moral heathen) I
frequently u&s;ed to ob|&s;erve to them the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of their
untimely zeal, which made them &s;o readily condemn me for what they called my
irreligious &s;arca&s;ms, which yet were but agreeable to my notions and
belief, whil&s;t they indulged them&s;elves in vices, &s;uch as duelling,
wenching, &s;wearing, and drinking, which were not only incom|patible with
theirs, but &s;uch as, bad as they thought me, I could not on any
con|&s;ideration be guilty of. The&s;e kinds of &s;e|vere rebukes ought, I
&s;ay, to have filled me with the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of my own more vile and
abominable incon&s;i&s;tency; but as that did not &s;o openly appear, the
applau&s;es I received from the &s;ober part, and even from &s;ome of the
mini&s;ters, for &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly pleading the cau&s;e of virtue, made me
quite blind to my more <PB N="177" REF="179"> odious vices; &s;o that as long
as the cha|racter or &s;hadow of moral virtue procured me &s;o much regard and
e&s;teem, I never troubled my&s;elf about the want of the real
&s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>Brigadier Lauder, a Scotti&s;h gentleman, well re&s;pected, and
colonel of a regiment in that garri&s;on, was then governor, and, unhappily for
me, conceived a curio&s;ity of &s;eeing me at his own hou&s;e, where were
a&s;&s;embled &s;everal officers, be&s;ides the mini&s;ter of the French
church, and Mr. Innes, chaplain to the Scotti&s;h regiment; and after dinner I
was admitted to have a kind of conference with them. I own, indeed, that the
account I gave of it in that publi&s;hed romance of mine, was far enough from
candid or impartial, with re|&s;pect to the French mini&s;ter, who was the
chief manager in the di&s;pute, my u&s;ual vanity having made me relate it too
much to his di&s;advantage, and Mr. Innes, be|tween whom and that gentleman
there was a great mi&s;under&s;tanding, added &s;ome other particulars, equally
mi&s;repre&s;ented and mortifying; but, abating that, the re&s;t is the
true&s;t part I can call to mind in that <PB N="178" REF="180"> forged
narrative of my&s;elf. However, Mr. Innes, &s;ince dubbed doctor by one of the
Scotch Univer&s;ities, and a near rela|tion to the governor, would not lo&s;e
&s;o fair an opportunity of triumphing over his rival, and finding that I had
nonplu&s;&s;ed him at almo&s;t every argument, but more particularly again&s;t
that of ab&s;olute prede&s;ti|nation, took occa&s;ion to inform me that it was
a doctrine as much condemned by &s;ome, as it was &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted
by other churches, and that con&s;equently Chri&s;ti|anity, he would undertake
to prove, was not to be charged with it. He had a much &s;moother and le&s;s
overbearing way of &s;peaking than the other gentleman, and kindly invited me
to his lodgings, where we might, at our lei&s;ure, di&s;cu&s;s that or any
other points in di&s;pute, not doubting but a per&s;on of my &s;en&s;e,
learn|ing, and &s;eeming candor (as he was plea&s;ed to compliment my vanity)
would ea&s;ily yield to conviction, when the point was once cleared to my
&s;atisfaction, as he did not doubt he &s;hould &s;hortly do.</P>
<P>I readily accepted of his invitation, by which I found he
de&s;igned to exclude the <PB N="179" REF="181"> French mini&s;ter from having
any &s;hare in our future conferences, but did not then &s;u&s;pect his farther
drift, which was, if he could, at any rate, or by any means, make a convert of
me, to recommend him&s;elf to the then worthy bi&s;hop of Lon|don, a per&s;on,
he knew, of &s;uch &s;ingular candor, as not to be over &s;u&s;picious, and too
generous not to encourage what he thought a charitable, worthy action; &s;o
that, as I ea&s;ily found afterwards, the hopes of procuring &s;ome preferment
to him&s;elf, rather than any regard or con|cern for me, was the main &s;pring
of all his pretended zeal for my conver&s;ion. I am &s;orry that I &s;hall be
obliged, in the &s;equel, to relate &s;everal very har&s;h truths concerning
his behaviour on this &s;candalous occa&s;ion, though I will be &s;till careful
to mention no more of it than is barely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et the matter in a
true light, and rather conceal than expo&s;e &s;uch parts of it, as have not an
immediate relation to the &s;ub|ject I am upon; much le&s;s will I go a|bout to
aggravate his faults, in order to extenuate my own. If he &s;hould be &s;till
alive when the&s;e memoirs &s;hall be publi&s;hed, <PB N="180" REF="182"> will
not be the fir&s;t thing that has been publi&s;hed with truth and ju&s;tice to
his di&s;|advantage, and may all contribute to in|&s;pire him with a true
remor&s;e and &s;incere repentance: if dead, it can neither hurt him, nor any
that belong to him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The doctor is long &s;ince dead,
and, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, hath left a character behind him that reflects no
great cre|dit to his cloth, and may ea&s;ily, among tho&s;e that knew him,
ju&s;tify what I have already &s;aid, and &s;hall be farther obliged to mention
in the &s;equel; he was not many years older than I when I fir&s;t came
acquainted with him, and I &s;oon perceived him to be a man of no &s;mall
ambition, though he was &s;o far from having any of the generous
di&s;po&s;ition which is mo&s;tly known to accompany it, that he was no le&s;s
a &s;lave to avarice: witne&s;s his arrogating to him&s;elf the credit as well
as advantage of that excellent treati&s;e, intituled, A Mode&s;t Enquiry after
Moral Virtue, for which he obtained from the pre&s;ent bi&s;hop of London a
very good living in E&s;&s;ex; but which the real and wor|thy author, a poor
epi&s;copal clergyman in Scotland, &s;ince obliged him publickly to di&s;own
and di&s;claim in print, as well as to compromi&s;e with him for the profit of
the edi|tion. This, together with his malver&s;ation in &s;undry re|&s;pects in
the pari&s;h of St. Margaret, We&s;tmin&s;ter, &s;till fre&s;h in people's
memory, obliged him to retire to his new living, where, I am told, he lived
very private, and, I hope, made the be&s;t u&s;e of his &s;olitude. As
therefore he had long ago lo&s;t his character among all that knew him, or had
heard of his &s;hameful actions, I thought my&s;elf le&s;s obliged to treat it
with that tenderne&s;s that I &s;hould have done, had he taken more care to
conceal his vile actions from the world.</NOTE>. He <PB N="181" REF="183"> was,
however, intent upon his pur&s;uit, and &s;o a&s;&s;iduous in &s;ending for me,
that &s;ome of the Dutch mini&s;ters thought fit likewi&s;e to do the &s;ame,
and more parti|cularly, as I found afterwards, to recon|cile me to their
favourite article of pre|de&s;tination, by expounding it to me ac|cording to
what they call the infralap&s;arian &s;y&s;tem, which is indeed le&s;s dreadful
and anti&s;criptural; but Mr. Innes ea&s;ily di&s;|&s;uaded me from going
among&s;t them, that he might have me wholly to him&s;elf, and &s;eldom failed
at our parting to clap a &s;mall piece of Dutch &s;ilver into my hand, which
proved an effectual bait to me, who was &s;till &s;o bad an oeconomi&s;t of my
poor &s;ol|dier's pay, and then wanted &s;everal nece&s;|&s;aries, with which
this &s;upplied me.</P>
<P>By this time I began not to be a little tired with a &s;oldier's
life, the place was very cold and bleak, the duty hard, and the pay &s;o
&s;mall, that even they who could make the mo&s;t of it, could but ju&s;t make
&s;hift to live on the plaine&s;t things; &s;o that all things con&s;idered,
there was no likelihood I &s;hould make any long oppo&s;ition to his arguments,
e&s;pecially as he took care to <PB N="182" REF="184"> back them with very
large promi&s;es of get|ting my di&s;charge, and bringing me into England,
where he made me hope to meet with the greate&s;t encouragement, and I own that
the pro&s;pect of &s;uch a change of life made &s;o great an impre&s;&s;ion
upon me, that he rather found me more for|ward to an&s;wer his de&s;ign than
was con|&s;i&s;tent with prudence, and too ready to be wholly directed by him.
As &s;oon as I had given him this a&s;&s;urance, he wrote a long letter to the
bi&s;hop of London, wherein he told me he had &s;aid &s;o many things in my
favour, that he doubted not of my &s;oon being &s;ent for by, and meeting with
the kinde&s;t reception from him. However, the wi&s;hed-for an&s;wer not
com|ing till &s;ix or &s;even weeks afterwards, gave me an opportunity of
&s;eeing farther into his temper, than I had been able to do; his me&s;&s;ages
to me were gradually le&s;s frequent, our interviews more cold, as well as our
parting, when he likewi&s;e with-held his hand from making me the u&s;ual
pre&s;ents. This latter I indeed &s;up|po&s;ed might be owing to his ca&s;h
running lower than u&s;ual; but I have &s;een &s;o many <PB N="183" REF="185">
in&s;tances of his nigardne&s;s, that I have more rea&s;on to impute it to
that, and partly to his de&s;pairing of the &s;ucce&s;s of his letter; for
whil&s;t he was in hopes of it, he had taken care to introduce me to &s;ome
learned gentlemen, mini&s;ters and o|thers, under pretence of examining
whe|ther I was capable of giving a &s;atisfactory account of my pretended
conver&s;ion, and had obtained from &s;ome of them very ad|vantageous
certificates in my favour, which he took no &s;mall pride to &s;hew to the
brigadier and to his other acquaintance; but upon the unexpected delay of the
an|&s;wer, he behaved with more coldne&s;s and indifference, till a jealous
thought &s;tarted in his mind, le&s;t that &s;hould encourage &s;ome of the&s;e
mini&s;ters, who had expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in my favour, to take the
bu|&s;ine&s;s out of his hand, and rob him of the credit of his new convert.
This &s;u&s;|picion made him all at once alter his be|haviour, and re&s;olve to
baptize me with &s;uch ha&s;te and &s;o little warning, that my &s;urprize gave
me no time to con&s;ider what an abominable piece of irreligion I had engaged
my&s;elf in, though I mu&s;t confe&s;s, <PB N="184" REF="186"> to my &s;hame;
that had he given me more time to think upon it, yet I have but too much
rea&s;on to think, his fair promi&s;es and delu&s;ive pro&s;pects would
ea&s;ily have &s;wal|lowed up all my &s;cruples and reluctance, upon his
fir&s;t renewal of them.</P>
<P>This, and &s;ome other parts of his beha|viour, had already
convinced me that a charitable de&s;ign of converting a &s;oul was the
farthe&s;t from his thoughts, and that he was &s;o far from believing me to be
what I pretended, that he had &s;ome time before taken a mo&s;t effectual way
to con|vince him&s;elf of the contrary, beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of doubting.
His &s;tratagem, if I may &s;o call it, was to make me tran&s;late a
pa&s;&s;age in Cicero de <HI>natur&acirc; deorum,</HI> of &s;ome length, into
my (pretended) For|mo&s;an language, and give it to him in writing; and this I
ea&s;ily did, by means of that unhappy readine&s;s I had at invent|ing of
characters, languages, &amp;c. But, after he had made me con&s;true it, and
de&s;ired me to write another ver&s;ion of it on another paper, his propo&s;al,
and the manner of his exacting it, threw me into &s;uch vi&s;ible confu&s;ion,
having had &s;o little <PB N="185" REF="187"> time to excogitate the fir&s;t,
and le&s;s to commit it to memory, that there were not above one half of the
words in the &s;econd that were in the fir&s;t. His de&s;iring me to con&s;true
this likewi&s;e, confu&s;ed me &s;till more; e&s;pecially, when he &s;hewed me
the palpable difference. The &s;erious air he a&s;|&s;umed upon it, made me
expect nothing el&s;e than a total rupture, and his expo&s;ing the impo&s;ture
in the manner I was con&s;ci|ous it de&s;erved. I was however agreeably (and,
to my &s;hame, I ought to add) de|ceived; and he finding, by this unexpect|ed
trial, what a memory and readine&s;s I had, and how qualified I was to carry on
&s;uch a cheat, began to clear his brow, and calm the di&s;order he had thrown
me into, by a more chearful and friendly look; but did not forget, at the
&s;ame time, to give me to under&s;tand, tho' at a great di&s;tance, that I
ought to take care to be better pro|vided for the future. I promi&s;ed to take
his advice, and did &s;o in part; but was become too indolent to go thro' the
fatigue of forming a whole language, at lea&s;t till I was convinced that it
would &s;tand me in &s;ome &s;tead; though, by what I have tried 
<PB N="186" REF="188"> &s;ince I came into England, I cannot &s;ay but I could
have compa&s;&s;ed it with le&s;s difficulty than can be conceived, had I been
capable of applying clo&s;ely to it. However, his continuing his a&s;&s;iduity
and &s;eeming regard for me, at lea&s;t till the delay of the bi&s;hop's
an&s;wer, which made him &s;u&s;pend it for ten or twelve days, gave me but too
much rea&s;on to think, that he had not one jot more of con&s;cience or
re|ligion than I, tho' older, and a learned di|vine, &s;ince he made no
&s;cruple not only to join in, but to encourage and pur&s;ue &s;o vile a cheat.
But if he had no more re|ligion, he had at lea&s;t more worldly pru|dence than
I, in that he laid the founda|tion for &s;ome con&s;iderable preferment for
him&s;elf; whil&s;t I, like the &s;tupid abandon|doned wretch I had been
hitherto, looked no farther than a little vain &s;atisfaction for the
pre&s;ent, or, at mo&s;t, a deliverance from the &s;oldier's life. For by that
time I could &s;ee &s;o far thro' all his artifices, and different behaviours,
that I did not much depend on any of his other promi&s;es. And he &s;oon after
gave me cau&s;e to think my|&s;elf not mi&s;taken in him. For when, upon 
<PB N="187" REF="189"> his bringing me into England, he got him|&s;elf into the
po&s;t of chaplain-general of the Engli&s;h forces in Portugal, by the
intere&s;t of the good bi&s;hop Compton, he not only left me to &s;hift for
my&s;elf, and to bear the brunt of all objections, but was guilty of &s;uch
other vile actions, as ea&s;ily con|vinced me that he was a more real convert
to Spinozi&s;m, than I was to him; for I ob&s;erved him often reading that
au|thor's po&s;thumous works, tho' he was an utter &s;tranger to his &s;ober
way of living. I had likewi&s;e a greater opinion of his parts and learning,
than I have &s;ince found cau&s;e for, which made me conclude, that I had no
rea&s;on to be more &s;crupulous than he, and this in a great mea&s;ure quelled
all my &s;light and tran&s;itory qualms, at lea&s;t till it came to the
&s;olemn pu&s;h.</P>
<P>I have already hinted, that his fear of being &s;upplanted by
&s;ome other mini&s;ter, made him re&s;olve to ha&s;ten the impious cere|mony,
for &s;o I thought it, whatever he did; but of this he had appri&s;ed me only
in general terms, and without fixing any time for it, or mentioning how he
de&s;ign|ed to perform it, probably that I might <PB N="188" REF="190"> think
the le&s;s upon it. Accordingly &s;ome days pa&s;&s;ed without my &s;eeing him,
or at lea&s;t hearing any thing about it, when one afternoon he &s;ent his man
to my lodgings, to acquaint me that he had fixed that evening about &s;ix of
the clock for it, and to de&s;ire me to be ready again&s;t the time. As I had
hardly three hours to con&s;ider of it, one may ea&s;ily imagine the
&s;urpri&s;e and hurry, the confu&s;ion and dread, it threw me into; and,
indeed, I was &s;o divided between the fear of bringing upon my&s;elf &s;ome
heavy judgment for &s;o impious a pro|phanation of that divine in&s;titution,
and the thoughts, if I &s;ubmitted to it, of be|having with &s;ome proper
decency under all tho&s;e tumults with which my mind was then agitated, that I
began to wi&s;h I might have re&s;olution enough to avoid it, when the dreaded
time was come. But that not only failed me, when I &s;aw the governor and
&s;everal other officers and gentlemen going to the chapel, where the mock
cere|mony was to be di&s;patched; but the devil, I believe, did then find a way
of calming my con&s;cience for the pre&s;ent, by putting it into my head that
it being to be per|formed <PB N="189" REF="191"> by a heretic, for &s;uch I
then judged, if not all the Prote&s;tant mini&s;ters, at lea&s;t &s;uch a one
as I now knew my un|godly guide to be, it could be indeed no &s;acrament, nor a
repetition of it. And this confu&s;ed di&s;tinction I then called to mind from
what I had learned at the &s;chools, tho' I was far enough from being
&s;atisfied that it was right. What &s;alvo he had for him&s;elf, I can only
gue&s;s; but, as far as I could perceive, he went thro' the ceremony with a
very compo&s;ed counte|nance and pre&s;ence of mind, and &s;eeming devotion;
and tho' he only had his Engli&s;h common-prayer book before him, yet he read
the office all in a good Latin off-hand, as the &s;aying is, and without any
he&s;ita|tion or &s;oleci&s;m, as tho&s;e ob&s;erved who heard him with greater
attention than I was then capable of. For tho' I was a perfect ma&s;ter of the
Latin, and he pro|nounced it, as mo&s;t of his countrymen do, in a very
intelligible manner; yet &s;uch was my confu&s;ion and hurry of &s;pirits, that
I &s;carcely knew or could mind one word he &s;aid. And a much greater one, I
dare affirm, I &s;hould have been in, had I been <PB N="190" REF="192"> either
able to attend to the &s;olemnity of the office, or had been made acquainted
with it before. But I was an utter &s;tranger to every part of it; and it is my
opinion, that he cho&s;e I &s;hould be &s;o, for he never once &s;hewed, much
le&s;s explained, the lea&s;t part of it in any of the meetings I gave him at
his lodgings. All I could recollect of the whole, was that I kept up &s;o much
pre&s;ence of mind, as to appear demure and &s;erious all the while, which I
thought very long, and that I was very glad when it was over, and much more
&s;o that my abominable hypocri&s;y had not been detect|ed, or rather
puni&s;hed, by &s;ome &s;evere judgment.</P>
<P>The name he gave me was that of George Lauder, which was that of
the governor, whom he had prevailed upon to pa&s;s for my godfather; and it was
accordingly en|tered into the mu&s;ter-roll, in&s;tead of that of Salmanazar,
which I had till then an|&s;wered to. This new name and &s;urname, joined to
&s;ome congratulations then given me, and a pre&s;ent of a pi&s;tole from the
governor, made me, for &s;ome time, for|get the heavy guilt I had plunged
my&s;elf <PB N="191" REF="193"> into. But this calm proved but &s;hort, and the
delay of the bi&s;hop's an&s;wer, and much more Mr. Innes's coldne&s;s and
in|difference, after he had once made &s;ure of me, &s;oon brought me to repent
of my wicked compliance, as I then judged it, though not &s;o much from a
&s;en&s;e of reli|gion, as becau&s;e I did not look upon my vanity and ambition
&s;ufficiently recom|pen&s;ed for the atrocious guilt I had con|tracted; and
this the reader will the better judge by what follows.</P>
<P>The long expected letter came at length; it was full of
commendations to Mr. Innes for his zeal, be&s;ides a very kind invitation to me
from that worthy prelate, to come over into England. I was by that time &s;o
weary of a &s;oldier's life, that I &s;hould have readily come upon a le&s;s
promi&s;ing pro&s;pect than that which he now began again to feed my &s;anguine
hopes with. Some things he talked to me quite incon|&s;i&s;tent with what, as I
before hinted, he knew of me, and which of cour&s;e could be no temptations to
me, unle&s;s I was ba&s;e enough to add &s;till more weight to my guilt; of
this kind in particular was what <PB N="192" REF="194"> he mentioned to me of a
de&s;ign of &s;end|ing me to Oxford, to teach the Formo&s;an language to a
&s;et of gentlemen, who were afterwards to go with me to convert tho&s;e people
to Chri&s;tianity, which, if he be|lieved any thing of, he mu&s;t needs de|pend
upon my inventing &s;uch a language, and involving my&s;elf in &s;till deeper
guilt; and yet I own, to my &s;hame, though I knew not with what view he could
men|tion &s;uch a propo&s;al, nor looked upon it but with dread, yet I could
not forbear being much elevated with it, though I was &s;till in hopes that I
might find &s;ome pretence for &s;etting it a&s;ide, and being made u&s;eful
there in &s;ome other and more &s;uitable way. How I might have behaved in
&s;uch a ca&s;e I know not, only I have rea&s;on to que&s;|tion whether I
&s;hould have had integrity and re&s;olution to have confe&s;&s;ed the truth,
rather than to have involved my&s;elf in a &s;till more &s;hameful impo&s;ture;
but, as I ob&s;erved before, I knew him too well to rely on any of his fluent
and di&s;ingenuous promi&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="195">The governor, at his reque&s;t, got me
di&s;|charged, or rather gave my captain ano|ther man in my room, whil&s;t Mr.
Innes took care to procure a certificate &s;igned by that gentleman and a
number of other officers of the garri&s;on, and even by &s;eve|ral mini&s;ters,
much more in my commen|dation than I could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve; after which,
having got all things in order for our departure, we &s;et out for Rotterdam,
where he introduced me to &s;ome per&s;ons of con&s;ideration for piety and
learning, particularly the celebrated Mr. Ba&s;nage, au|thor of the
Continuation of the Jewi&s;h Hi&s;tory, and likewi&s;e to &s;ome of the
mi|ni&s;ters and gentlemen of the Engli&s;h church, and to &s;ome of the French
Pro|te&s;tants there; among whom I was &s;o much care&s;&s;ed, that I begun to
look upon my&s;elf in a very agreeable and advan|tageous light. There were,
however, two things that mortified me not a little, viz. the mean appearance I
made in &s;ome ca&s;t|off cloaths, with which Mr. Innes had &s;upplied me upon
my leaving off my regi|mental ones, but which were both too big and too long
for me, and the &s;hrewd que&s;|tions <PB N="194" REF="196"> put to me by
&s;everal gentlemen, which convinced me that they did not give all the credit I
could have wi&s;hed, to the ac|count I gave of my&s;elf and country. For as to
any real remor&s;e or concern for the &s;hame|ful part I was acting, I found it
&s;it lighter on my mind, in proportion to the many things I met with that
flattered my vanity. The more effectually therefore to remove the&s;e two
ob&s;tacles to it, I fell upon one of the mo&s;t whim&s;ical expedients that
could come into a crazed brain, viz. that of liv|ing upon raw fle&s;h, roots
and herbs; and it is &s;urpri&s;ing how &s;oon I habituated my|&s;elf to this
new, and, till now, &s;trange food, without receiving the lea&s;t pre|judice in
my health; but I was ble&s;&s;ed with a good con&s;titution, and I took care to
u&s;e a good deal of pepper, or other &s;pices, for a concocter, whil&s;t my
vanity, and the people's &s;urprize at my diet, &s;erved me for a reli&s;hing
&s;auce.</P>
<P>We embarked at the Brill for England in the packet-boat, and in
our pa&s;&s;age had &s;uch a dreadful &s;torm, that as many pa&s;|&s;engers,
and among them Mr. Innes, got into the long boat, as it could well con|tain. 
<PB N="195" REF="197"> They all &s;hewed an uncommon dread in their looks,
whil&s;t I, who &s;taid behind, beheld them with a kind of &s;tu|pid unconcern,
rather than a generous pity, every moment in danger of meeting with that
dreadful end they had endeavoured to avoid; yet, terrible as the &s;ight was,
it hardly rai&s;ed in me one &s;erious re&s;olu|tion again&s;t the more
dangerous de&s;ign I was unhappily embarked in, or the more dreadful
&s;hipwreck I had expo&s;ed my&s;elf to, that of the &s;oul; or if any &s;uch
thoughts came then into my mind, they were &s;oon di&s;pelled at our landing at
Harwich, and at the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect with which Mr. Innes had flattered my
ambition and va|nity. At my arrival at London, Mr. Innes, and &s;ome worthy
clergymen of his acquaintance, introduced me to the bi&s;hop of London, by whom
I was received with great humanity, and got &s;oon after a good number of
friends among the clergy and laity, mo&s;t of them per&s;ons of piety and
worth. But I had a much greater number of oppo&s;ers to combat with, who put me
under a nece&s;&s;ity of having my &s;en&s;es and memory about me more than
ever, to avoid <PB N="196" REF="198"> a fatal detection; for I had been &s;o
negligent, notwith&s;tanding Mr. Innes's caution of be|ing prepared, again&s;t
exigencies, with a lan|guage and a prudent readine&s;s at reading and writing
my new invented character, that had I been attacked on that &s;ide, I mu&s;t
have been infallibly foiled; but they took a contrary way, and though they
judged rightly of me in the main, yet I can &s;afely affirm, that they have
been very far from being candid, or even ju&s;t in the account of the
di&s;coveries they pretended to have made, to my di&s;advantage; parti|cularly
Drs. Halley, Mead and Woodward; and as I had then &s;everal zealous patrons of
great candor and integrity, who made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;earch into the
bottom of tho&s;e reports, they found &s;o much &s;o|phi&s;try and
di&s;ingenuity in them, that I cannot but ob&s;erve here, that the too
vi&s;i|ble eagerne&s;s of the&s;e gentlemen to ex|po&s;e me, at any rate, for a
cheat, &s;erved only to make the more &s;erious and candid part think the
better of me, and to look upon me as a kind of confe&s;&s;or, e&s;peci|ally as
the three gentlemen abovementioned, but more particularly the fir&s;t, were
known <PB N="197" REF="199"> to be no great admirers of the Chri&s;tian
revelation, to which my patrons thought I had given &s;o ample a te&s;timony.
My complexion, indeed, which was very fair, appeared an unan&s;werable
objection again&s;t me; there being but few &s;uch to be met with in tho&s;e
hot climates, e&s;peci|ally that of Formo&s;a, which lies under the tropic; but
by the help of what I had read or heard of &s;ome of tho&s;e coun|tries, I
&s;oon hatched a lucky di&s;tinction between tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s
expo&s;es them to the heat of the &s;un, and tho&s;e who keep altogether at
home, in cool &s;hades, or apartments under ground, and &s;carce ever feel the
lea&s;t degree of the reigning heat. And this di&s;tinction indeed is not only
very rea&s;onable, but was afterwards confirmed by per&s;ons of candor and
ex|perience, who had been in tho&s;e countries, and affirmed that they had
&s;een per&s;ons as fair as any northern Europeans, tho' not in &s;o great a
number, that lived under the rays of a vertical &s;un.</P>
<P>On the other hand, my oppo&s;ers were as much at a lo&s;s how to
find out my real country, either by my idiom, or my pro|nunciation 
<PB N="198" REF="200"> of the Latin, French, Italian, or any other language I
was ma&s;ter of. For though this may appear an ea&s;y thing to be done, by
tho&s;e who are acquainted with the European languages, and the dif|ferent
pronunciations peculiar to every na|tion, yet both my idiom and pronuncia|tion
were &s;o mixed and blended, and I may &s;ay de&s;ignedly &s;o, by the many
lan|guages I had learned, and nations I had been conver&s;ant with, that it was
impo&s;&s;i|ble for the mo&s;t curious judge to di&s;cover in it any thing like
an uniform likene&s;s to any other European one they knew of. Dr. Mead, indeed,
took upon him to be very po&s;itive from both, that I was of ei|ther German or
Dutch extract; he could not have pitched upon a more unlikely one, &s;eeing the
Dutch idiom and language were the only one I was the lea&s;t acquainted with,
and accordingly &s;ome of my friends, who were better judges of &s;uch matters,
and could plainly &s;ee that mine was more oppo&s;ite to them than to any
other, did freely cen&s;ure him for it, and tell him he might as well have
affirmed me to be an Ethiopian from my complexion, as a Ger|man 
<PB N="199" REF="201"> from my pronunciation. But the truth was, I knew enough
of all of them to blend my di&s;cour&s;e more or le&s;s with any of them, as
either to put people up|on the wrong &s;cent, whil&s;t I kept every one from
getting into the right one; for I can &s;afely &s;ay that I never met with, nor
heard of any one, that ever gue&s;&s;ed right, or any thing near it, with
re&s;pect to my native country.</P>
<P>I might here add &s;everal vi&s;ible advan|tages which my friends
might ju&s;tly take in my defence, and among them a great number of
&s;candalous fal&s;hoods di&s;per&s;ed abroad from what quarter I know not, of
which tho&s;e, who were better acquainted with me, knew me to be wholly
innocent, as well as crimes. I was naturally aver&s;e to, &s;uch as drinking,
gaming, &amp;c. for, bating my vain-glori|ous foible, which, though I could not
overcome, I took &s;uch care to conceal from them by the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite
behavi|our, my conver&s;ation was &s;uch as the mo&s;t cen&s;orious could not
have blamed, but which my friends highly admired in me. The plainne&s;s of my
dre&s;s and diet, <PB N="200" REF="202"> the little trouble I gave my&s;elf
about worldly wealth, preferment, or even ac|quiring or &s;ecuring a bare
competency, a good-natured and charitable di&s;po&s;ition, vi&s;ibly natural to
me, my aver&s;ene&s;s to drinking, lewd women, &amp;c. and a great
re&s;ervedne&s;s to &s;uch of the fair &s;ex as had either lo&s;t their
reputation, though they lived &s;till in credit and &s;plendor, and even to
tho&s;e who betrayed too &s;mall a regard for their character, the
conver&s;ation of whom I profe&s;&s;edly avoided, though again&s;t my own
intere&s;t, not indeed &s;o much from a principle of virtue, as an affectation
of it; the&s;e, together with the warmth I natu|rally expre&s;&s;ed for
religion, and the real delight I took in the public offices of it, appeared
&s;uch convincing proofs of my &s;incerity, that tho&s;e of my friends, to whom
I was mo&s;t intimately known, were the mo&s;t impatient, and di&s;plea&s;ed to
have it called in que&s;tion; for who could imagine, as they often urged, that
a youth of &s;o much &s;en&s;e and learning for his years, &s;o &s;eemingly
free from am|bition and other vices, could be abandon|ed enough to be guilty of
&s;uch abomi|nable <PB N="201" REF="203"> an impo&s;ture and impiety, for the
&s;ake of a little plain, homely food and ray|ment, beyond which he neither
makes the lea&s;t effort, or &s;eems to have the lea&s;t wi&s;h.</P>
<P>I am aware that what I have &s;aid in the la&s;t paragraph, will
&s;o far carry the face of my once favourite vanity, that it will be
cen|&s;ured by &s;everal of my readers as a rank piece of o&s;tentation, rather
than a &s;incere acknowledgment of my guilt; tho' a more candid one, who joins
both parts of it to|gether, will rather &s;ee, that the di&s;play of the one,
is only the greater aggravation of the other. But as neither was the motive of
what I have there &s;aid, but rather to do ju&s;tice to tho&s;e friends of mine
who &s;o kindly took my part on that account, I had much rather undergo
cen&s;ure a|gain&s;t my&s;elf, than to have omitted any thing that can
vindicate their character, and convince the world that the zeal they
expre&s;&s;ed for me, was really the effect of a mo&s;t candid and charitable
con&s;truction on a life &s;o &s;eemingly innocent and di&s;in|tere&s;ted, and
not owing to any ra&s;h or blind prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or to an unrea&s;onable
<PB N="202" REF="204"> oppo&s;ition again&s;t my cen&s;urers, much le&s;s to
di&s;hone&s;t connivance with any views or de&s;igns of mine; when I am very
&s;ure, that if they had had any well-grounded &s;u&s;picion of my being what I
was, an im|po&s;tor, they would have been the fir&s;t who would not only have
expo&s;ed me to the world, but would have become my mo&s;t irreconcileable
enemies. And I thought my&s;elf the more obliged, in ju&s;tice as well as
gratitude, to &s;ay thus much in their vindication; becau&s;e &s;ome of them,
men of probity and learning, undertook to be my advocates in print, and not
only complained of tho&s;e a&s;per|&s;ions &s;o freely and unju&s;tly ca&s;t
upon me, but even challenged my accu&s;ers, in &s;e|veral adverti&s;ements
publi&s;hed in the Lon|don Gazzette, to prove any of them again&s;t me, or to
produce any one &s;olid proof or objection again&s;t the account I had given of
my&s;elf. Notwith&s;tanding, which cha|ritable efforts on my behalf, and the
can|did vindication they printed &s;ome months after, both they and I had the
mortifica|tion to find (and I have had &s;ince great rea&s;on to ble&s;s God
for it) that my fabu|lous <PB N="203" REF="205"> account was as much
di&s;credited by the greate&s;t part of the world as ever; which proved an
effectual means, in time, to bring me, thro' his mercy, to a deeper &s;en&s;e
of my folly and impiety, than I could have been, if that had gained a more
ge|neral credit.</P>
<P>There was likewi&s;e a variety of judgments formed about me, by
tho&s;e who thought me a cheat. Tho&s;e of the church of Rome believed I was
bribed to that impo&s;ture by &s;ome Engli&s;h mini&s;ters, on purpo&s;e to
ex|po&s;e their church. The Prote&s;tants in Holland were much of the &s;ame
mind; but added, that I was farther hired to explode their doctrine of
prede&s;tination, and cry up the epi&s;copacy of the church of England, in
derogation of their Pre&s;by|terian government. Here &s;ome repre&s;ented me as
a je&s;uit or prie&s;t in di&s;gui&s;e, others as a tool of the nonjurors,
becau&s;e Mr. Innes had introduced me among a &s;et of them, particularly the
famed Mr. Le&s;ley, of who&s;e writings, as well as in&s;tructive and facetious
company, I was very fond; and I may add, that their conver&s;ation had not a
little bia&s;&s;ed me to their principles, <PB N="204" REF="206"> e&s;pecially
as I found them &s;o conformable to the &s;chool divinity I had learned be|yond
&s;ea, tho' it never affected me &s;o far as to go to any of their meetings.
How|ever, the reader may &s;ee, by what I have &s;aid hitherto, that all
the&s;e various opinions were but random &s;hots, and without any foundation.
And indeed my ca&s;e was &s;o intricate and perplexing, that it was next to
impo&s;&s;ible for the able&s;t heads to have gue&s;&s;ed what my motives were,
or for what, or by whom, I was induced thus to impo&s;e upon mankind. And I am
fully per&s;uaded, that my being wholly innocent of any &s;uch vile de&s;igns,
either again&s;t the church or &s;tate, or of being employed by the enemies of
either, was the cau&s;e of my di&s;appointment turning &s;o much to my
advantage, which might otherwi&s;e have been attended with a more fatal and
&s;hameful cata&s;trophe; and that the merci|ful judge of all hearts, knowing
mine to be actuated only by mere youthful folly and vanity, without any other
dangerous or guilty de&s;ign, than the indulging a wild and phrantic
pa&s;&s;ion (which was grown too powerful for me to re&s;i&s;t, with that 
<PB N="205" REF="207"> little &s;hare of rea&s;on and experience I was then
ma&s;ter of, and with the&s;e di&s;advant|ages and temptations I laboured
under) did, in his great pity, prevent my going on and peri&s;hing under &s;uch
a load of un|repented guilt, and I accordingly de&s;ire to be ever thankful for
that great and unde|&s;erved in&s;tance of his divine mercy and goodne&s;s.
And, next to my humble ac|knowledgment of it, I do think my&s;elf bound to
declare thus &s;olemnly, that I never was &s;et upon, nor directly or
indi|rectly inticed, by any &s;et of men for any private ends, to act the part
I did, except what I have lately related of Mr. Innes's encouragements and
promi&s;es to me, in which I am very well &s;atisfied he had no other ends to
&s;erve, but that of his own private intere&s;t and advancement.</P>
<P>I am far enough however from reflecting upon, or bearing any
re&s;entment again&s;t tho&s;e who looked upon me as a tool of &s;ome
de&s;igning &s;et of men, engaged in &s;ome private de&s;ign. It was not
natural to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch a young, and, in all appearance, as well as
reality, raw and unexperienced fellow, could of his own <PB N="206" REF="208">
head have imbarked in &s;uch an impo&s;|ture, and carried it on &s;o long, and
with &s;uch boldne&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s, as to have pro|cured to him&s;elf &s;o
many zealous patrons among men of character for learning and probity, unle&s;s
he had been privately &s;et upon, in&s;tructed, and &s;upported in it, by
&s;ome de&s;igning per&s;ons of more years, di&s;cretion, and abilities, tho'
from what quarter was not ea&s;y to gue&s;s, either from my behaviour,
writings, or any view they could perceive me in pur&s;uit of. As for tho&s;e
who took me for a je&s;uit, prie&s;t, or emi&s;&s;ary from Rome, they were
certainly the wide&s;t from the mark. The gentle|men of that church were always
my mo&s;t &s;trenuous oppo&s;ers, and not without cau&s;e, as they could be
very &s;ure that whatever de&s;ign or errand I might be embarked in, it could
not be in favour of it; and had my fabulous account met with that credit which
it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed was expected, it mu&s;t have done their cau&s;e more
di&s;|&s;ervice than any private de&s;ign I might carry on could have done
good. Be&s;ides, it was vi&s;ible I &s;hunned their company as much as
po&s;&s;ible, tho' my motive for it, <PB N="207" REF="209"> the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own guilt, was not &s;o apparent. I never conver&s;ed
with any of them, but in the jarring and con|trover&s;ial way; and, tho' at
that time much again&s;t my con&s;cience, was a &s;tre|nuous oppo&s;er of their
particular doctrines, both in conver&s;ation and writing. I never once entered
into any of their chapels, (nor have &s;ince, all the time I have been in
England) neither did I &s;hew the lea&s;t favour or partiality towards them.
This was indeed rather looked upon as an arti|fice, &s;aid to be very u&s;ual
and common among&s;t them, it being urged as an ob|&s;ervation of a long
&s;tanding, that tho&s;e di&s;gui&s;ed emi&s;&s;aries affected to appear the
mo&s;t outrageous enemies of that cau&s;e they were privately carrying on.
Whether the fact be true or not, I can only &s;ay, that I never knew of any
&s;uch but by hear&s;ay; neither am I any farther concerned about it, than to
&s;ay, that I was the farthe&s;t from being one of that &s;ort, and that
whatever I have &s;aid or written again&s;t that church, was only with a view
of gaining credit to my&s;elf, without any view of &s;erving or hurting it, or
indeed caring which of the <PB N="208" REF="210"> two was likely to be the
re&s;ult. For tho' all the arguments I had heard or read a|gain&s;t it, and in
which I was not a little ver&s;ed, had not yet been able to wipe off the
prejudices of my education, which I had imbibed under the je&s;uits and
domi|nicans, of its being, if not the only &s;aving church as they affirm it to
be, yet, at lea&s;t, of its not being &s;o bad and corrupt, &s;o dan|gerous and
damnable a one as &s;ome Prote|&s;tants, with more zeal than charity, have
repre&s;ented it, under the odious titles of Anti-chri&s;t, whore of Babylon,
&amp;c. never|thele&s;s, my youth and incon&s;iderate vanity would not &s;uffer
me to enquire whether or no, or how far, I incurred a guilt in my oppo&s;ing
and expo&s;ing it.</P>
<P>It was likewi&s;e from the &s;ame &s;hameful motive of vanity that
I pretended, from my own knowledge, not only to confirm but aggravate the black
account which authors had publi&s;hed again&s;t the je&s;uits and other
mi&s;&s;ionaries, e&s;pecially with regard to their boa&s;ted conver&s;ions and
&s;ucce&s;s in the Ea&s;t-Indies, and more particularly concerning the cau&s;e
of the per&s;ecution rai&s;ed again&s;t the Chri&s;tians in Japan; when all
that I <PB N="209" REF="211"> knew of it was only from reading or hear-&s;ay.
And as to the Je&s;uits, though I was then and am &s;till &s;en&s;ible that
&s;ome of their maxims, tenets, and politics, do ju&s;tly de&s;erve to be
condemned; yet I was far enough from having &s;uch di&s;ad|vantageous notions
of that &s;ociety, as the world &s;eems generally to have of it, and much
le&s;s from any thing I had ever ob|&s;erved among them, con&s;idering how
young I was when I left them, and how clo&s;e and reclu&s;e they keep
them&s;elves from the re&s;t of the world. But whe|ther they de&s;erve the
di&s;advantageous cha|racter they have, or not, which is be&s;t known to him,
to whom both they and every man is to give an account at the la&s;t great day,
it is incumbent upon me thus far to do them ju&s;tice, as to own, that tho&s;e
reflexions I have ca&s;t upon their mi&s;&s;ionaries in China and Japan, had no
other foundation than common report, without any enquiry whether that was true
or fal&s;e; &s;o far was I from having any ju&s;t or real rea&s;on for
confirming or ag|gravating it. As for the re&s;t of the prie&s;ts of that
church, as far as I was capable of <PB N="210" REF="212"> judging of them, in
tho&s;e juvenile days in which I was more intimately conver&s;ant with
&s;everal of them, I can only &s;ay, with the common voice, that there are good
and bad among them, though per|haps to a much higher degree than I have had
occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve of tho&s;e of any other church. One thing I can truly
&s;ay, however, to their prai&s;e, that they gene|rally take greater care to
in&s;truct their youth in matters of religion, and to oblige them all to
a&s;&s;i&s;t at their catechetical lec|tures on Sundays in the afternoon. The
misfortune was, that we had no books to learn them by heart beforehand, but the
prie&s;t was forced by repetitions to incul|cate them in our memories; whence
it followed, that tho&s;e who were wanting either in attention or memory, went
a|way little the better for the pains he took with them. As for me, I never
failed coming, becau&s;e my memory being very tenacious, and my apprehen&s;ions
pretty quick, I could carry an an&s;wer of any length at once or twice
repeating, &s;o that I was mo&s;tly the fir&s;t interrogated, and re|ceived no
&s;mall commendations from our <PB N="211" REF="213"> in&s;tructors,
e&s;pecially as I was one of the younge&s;t, and was as ready at tho&s;e
an|&s;wers on the next meeting, as if I had thought on nothing el&s;e all that
time. And as this u&s;ed to make me to be much admired by the numerous
audience, &s;o it of cour&s;e failed not to feed me with &s;e|cret pride, and a
natural fondne&s;s for all &s;uch occa&s;ions of &s;hewing my talents.</P>
<P>The &s;ame happened to me on my coming fir&s;t into England, when
Dr. Innes, proud of his pretended pro&s;elyte, introduced me into the company
of all the learned di|vines of his acquaintance, that they might hear me
de&s;cant on the grounds of my conver&s;ion; and I was by that time &s;o well
ver&s;ed in that kind of learning, more from the books I occa&s;ionally read on
that &s;ubject, than from any pains he had taken to in&s;truct me, that I
believe few people of my years, notwith&s;tanding I had mur|dered &s;o much of
my time, could have &s;aid more in defence of the Chri&s;tian re|ligion; all
which was &s;ufficiently acknow|ledged with no &s;mall commendations and
congratulations, both by all that heard me, and by tho&s;e who have fir&s;t
read the&s;e ar|guments <PB N="212" REF="214"> in the fictitious book
above|mentioned; for that &s;y&s;tem of religion, and defence of
Chri&s;tianity, was what I had mo&s;tly extracted out of Limborch, and &s;ome
other divines, without Dr. Innes's help, or even knowledge, though what follows
there, with re&s;pect to Church go|vernment, was wholly his, as may be
ea|&s;ily perceived from the difference of &s;tyle and method. However, when
all the&s;e kinds of conver&s;ations were ended, my doctor failed not to &s;pur
my pride &s;till far|ther on, by telling me what tho&s;e gentle|men &s;aid in
my commendation, which, whether or not exaggerated by him, gave me &s;uch an
extraordinary notion of my parts, that I was proud of every opportunity of
&s;hewing my&s;elf in all companies and public places, without any other view
than that of feeding my natural vanity, whil&s;t he was privately pur&s;uing
what appeared to him more weighty, the advancing of his fortune, to which end
he &s;trove to in|troduce me, and him&s;elf by my means, to all the great men
in church and &s;tate, which he found no hard matter to do, becau&s;e, ere I
had been in London three <PB N="213" REF="215"> months, I had been &s;o cried
up for a pro|digy, that they were all exceedingly de|&s;irous of &s;eeing and
conver&s;ing with me; and not only the dome&s;tic, but even the foreign papers,
had helped to blaze forth many things in my prai&s;e, for which there was not
any foundation. Thus I remem|ber a remarkable article from London, printed in
the Dutch and French papers, that the young Japaner had been pre&s;ented to the
archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who admired him chiefly for his readine&s;s in
&s;peaking a great variety of languages. Whereas I cannot call to mind that I
&s;poke any but the Latin, which his grace having either forgot, or being
unu&s;ed to my fo|reign pronunciation, was forced to have interpreted to him,
by Dr. Innes, in Engli&s;h. So that I found I needed not to be very
&s;olicitous to blow my own trumpet, when the common cry, and the public
papers, did it beyond my expectation for me. I had indeed a fluency of the
Latin, and a &s;mattering of &s;everal modern lan|guages, as well as a great
readine&s;s in learn|ing them, had I applied my&s;elf to them; but I boa&s;ted
of more knowledge in them <PB N="214" REF="216" MS="y"> by far than I had,
e&s;pecially in the oriental ones; tho' at that time quite ignorant of
them.</P>
<P>I had not been two months in London be|fore the doctor per&s;uaded
me to tran&s;late the church catechi&s;m into my pretended Formo&s;an language;
and I, tho' much a|gain&s;t my will, was forced, by his over|bearing command,
not only to perform the odious ta&s;k, but to pre&s;ent it afterwards to the
bi&s;hop of London, who received and rewarded it with his u&s;ual candor and
ge|nero&s;ity, and laid it up among his other curious manu&s;cripts, tho' it
rather de&s;erved to have been condemned to the flames. However, the doctor had
his own views to &s;erve, one of which was to confirm me in the good opinion of
that worthy prelate, and of as many other gentlemen as &s;hould either &s;ee or
hear of it. And another, to make me exert my talents in inventing and
familiari&s;ing my&s;elf to this pretended For|mo&s;an language and character,
for fear my want of it &s;hould cau&s;e &s;ome unexpected di&s;covery, at
lea&s;t before he had got the preferment he was in pur&s;uit of. When I had
fini&s;hed the pretended ver&s;ion, he not <PB N="215" REF="217"> only examined
it him&s;elf carefully, but got other per&s;ons to do the &s;ame, who all found
the language &s;o regular and gram|matical, as well as different from all
others they knew, both with re&s;pect to the words and idiom, that they gave it
as their opi|nion, that it mu&s;t be a real language, and could be no
counterfeit, much le&s;s have been invented by &s;uch a &s;tripling as I; and
hence &s;ome of tho&s;e of my oppo&s;ers, who thought me a Romi&s;h prie&s;t in
di&s;gui&s;e, imagined that I had been a&s;&s;i&s;ted in, or taught it, by
&s;ome of the fraternity be|yond &s;ea. I &s;hould have ob&s;erved, that I had
taken care to write it in one column in Roman character, with an interlineal
Latin ver&s;ion in Italick, and in my invent|ed character on the oppo&s;ite
column.</P>
<P>As he found me to &s;ucceed &s;o well in this vile piece of
invention, he &s;oon after pre|vailed upon me to write the hi&s;tory of
Formo&s;a, and got &s;everal of his and my acquaintance to back the motion, as
a thing which would bring much credit and profit to me, and be very acceptable
to the public. One might have imagined, that a ta&s;k &s;o arduous and
dangerous would have &s;tart|led <PB N="216" REF="218"> &s;uch a raw young
fellow as I was, be|ing then &s;carce twenty years old, and &s;o very great a
&s;tranger to the&s;e countries. I had indeed got &s;ome imperfect notions from
a few books that had fallen in my way, as well as from conver&s;ation with
tho&s;e who had either been in tho&s;e parts, or had read more about them than
I, but was forced to hatch many things out of my own fertile fancy, to &s;upply
the defects of my knowledge. One thing I found a great help and relief from,
that the accounts we then had of that i&s;land from Candidus, a Dutch
mini&s;ter, who had re&s;ided there, and from the re&s;t of the writers who had
in &s;ome mea&s;ure copied him, were &s;tuffed with &s;uch mon&s;trous
ab&s;urdities and contradictions, and that the place upon the whole was &s;o
very un|known to the Europeans, even to tho&s;e who had been in China, Japan,
and other parts of that country, that I might the more ea&s;ily make whatever I
&s;hould &s;ay of it, to pa&s;s current with the generality of the world. So
that without much he|&s;itation I undertook the work, and re&s;olv|ed with
my&s;elf to give &s;uch a de&s;cription <PB N="217" REF="219"> of it as
&s;hould be wholly new and &s;urpriz|ing, and &s;hould in mo&s;t particulars
cla&s;h with all the accounts other writers had given of it; particularly that
it belonged to Japan, contrary to what all other writers and travellers have
affirmed of its being &s;ubject to China. And this I was left to hammer out of
my own brain, without any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance than that of Varenius's
de&s;cription of Japan, which Dr. Innes put into my hands, to get what I could
out of it. All this while both he and the book|&s;ellers were &s;o earne&s;t
for my di&s;patching it out of hand, whil&s;t the town was hot in expectation
of it, that I was &s;carcely allowed two months to write the whole,
notwith&s;tanding the many avocations I had by frequent vi&s;itors, and
invitations abroad. So that it is no wonder the thing came out &s;o crude,
imperfect, and ab&s;urd, and more &s;o would it have been, had not the
per&s;on, who engli&s;hed it from my Latin, a&s;&s;i&s;ted me to correct many
more and greater improbabilities, which I had not had time to di&s;cover: but
he like|wi&s;e was hurried on by the book&s;ellers, and had the fewer
opportunities of con|&s;ulting <PB N="218" REF="220"> me on that head.
Be&s;ides, there was one maxim I could never be prevailed upon to depart from,
viz. that whatever I had once affirmed in conver&s;ation, tho' to ever &s;o few
people, and tho' ever &s;o improbable, or even ab&s;urd, &s;hould never be
amended or contradicted in the narra|tive. Thus having once, inadvertently in
conver&s;ation, made the yearly number of &s;acrificed infants to amount
eighteen thou&s;and, I could never be per&s;uaded to le&s;&s;en it, though I
had been often made &s;en&s;ible of the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;o &s;mall an
i&s;land lo&s;ing &s;o many males every year, without becoming at length quite
depopu|lated, &s;uppo&s;ing the inhabitants to have been &s;o &s;tupid as to
comply with, or the prie&s;ts inhuman enough to have exacted &s;uch a number of
human victims. I mu&s;t moreover ob&s;erve here, that my friends found &s;till
a much weightier objection a|gain&s;t my account, viz. how &s;uch a
&s;trip|ling as I mu&s;t be when I left that coun|try (for being then but near
twenty years of age I could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been above fifteen or
&s;ixteen, upon my pretended coming away) could give &s;uch 
<PB N="219" REF="221"> a large and particular account of it, as could hardly
have been expected from a man of twice my age. Many of them were hence inclined
to impute what was &s;o liable to objection in my narrative to my want of years
and experience, which might make me the more liable to mi&s;take. This, though
a very candid excu&s;e for me, I was not inclined to admit of, and therefore,
to abate the wonder, was forced, by Dr. Innes's advice, to a&s;&s;ume three
years more than I had, and to pretend I was nineteen years when I came away,
and between twenty-two and twenty-three at the writing of the book; more than
that had I pretended to be, my face, air, and behaviour would have given me the
lye, for in that only re&s;pect did I appear what I really was, a raw, young,
hot-headed and incon&s;iderate &s;tripling. However, the&s;e mon&s;tro&s;ities,
as I may ju&s;tly call them, which gave me &s;o much trouble to vindi|cate
afterwards, both in company and in a new preface to the &s;econd edition of
that vile romance, have really, &s;ince I came to be in a better mind, proved
no &s;mall com|fort to me, &s;ince they have been an effec|tual 
<PB N="22O" REF="222"> means of di&s;crediting the whole rela|tion, and &s;aved
me the trouble and &s;hame of doing it in print, e&s;pecially during the life
of many of my worthy friends, who, from a real principle of candor and charity,
had publicly engaged in my quarrel, and to whom &s;uch an open acknowledgment
mu&s;t have given the greate&s;t mortification; &s;o that though I was come by
that time to abhor the impo&s;ture, yet I contented my&s;elf with owning it
only to &s;ome of my mo&s;t intimate friends; and in other com|pany, when
que&s;tioned about it, with turning the &s;ubject in &s;uch manner as &s;hould
give them to under&s;tand, that I was a&s;hamed to enter farther into it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t edition had not been long pub|li&s;hed before it was
all &s;old, and a new one demanded, with &s;uch alterations and vindication of
the old one as might mo&s;t likely promote the &s;ale, and &s;atisfy at once
the curio&s;ity of the public, and the avarice of the proprietor; for, as to
me, I had only the &s;mall &s;um of ten guineas for the copy of the fir&s;t,
and twelve more for the improvements in the &s;econd, be|&s;ides &s;uch
pre&s;ents as were made me by <PB N="221" REF="223"> the generous few to whom I
pre&s;ented them. But before I ventured on the &s;e|cond, I was &s;ent by the
good bi&s;hop of London, and my other friends, to Oxford, to pur&s;ue &s;uch
&s;tudies as I was fit for, or inclined to, whil&s;t my oppo&s;ers and
advo|cates were di&s;puting here about the merit or demerit of the fir&s;t. And
when I came to the univer&s;ity, I found many learned and worthy friends as
warmly engaged for, as others were again&s;t me; and with this &s;eeming
advantage on my &s;ide, at which I have had frequent occa&s;ion to blu&s;h,
that the former were men of the be&s;t character for candor and probity, as
well as learning and parts, and whom, for that very rea&s;on, I forbear, as I
ought, to name, their partiality for me being the mere effect of too
exten&s;ive a charity and genero&s;ity, and which only expo&s;ed them to the
&s;arca&s;ms and ridicule of my oppo|nents.</P>
<P>However that be, I had a convenient a|partment a&s;&s;igned me in
one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable colleges by the worthy head of it, a man in
high reputation for his writ|ings and univer&s;al skill in all polite
litera|ture, <PB N="222" REF="224"> and e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t
ac|compli&s;hed gentlemen of his age. I was not, indeed, immatriculated, for
rea&s;ons &s;carce worth troubling the world with, but had all the other
advantages of learning which that college or the univer&s;ity could afford me,
either by acce&s;s to the public and private libraries, or by acquaintance with
&s;ome of the learned in &s;everal other colleges as well as our own, and in
this la&s;t I had, moreover, a very worthy and learned tutor a&s;&s;igned me,
who not only gave me leave to a&s;&s;i&s;t at all the lectures he read to his
other pupils, &s;ome of whom were gentlemen of high birth and for|tune, and
greatly advanced in learning, but allowed, and even invited me to make &s;uch
objections as my mind &s;ugge&s;ted to me, or even to chu&s;e the &s;ubject of
our entertainment, whether the Newtonian phi|lo&s;ophy, logic, poetry, or
divinity; which la&s;t was, of all others, my favourite one, as well as in a
great mea&s;ure his, for he took orders &s;oon after I left Oxford.</P>
<P>As to the mathematics, in which he was al&s;o well &s;killed,
though I had a great opinion of that &s;tudy, yet could I never 
<PB N="223" REF="225"> be prevailed to go over the thre&s;hold; and the
needle&s;s demon&s;trations, as I then thought them, to many of Euclid's
propo|&s;itions, which appeared to me &s;elf-evi|dent, &s;uch as that the lines
that are drawn through a circle, are longer or &s;horter ac|cording to their
nearne&s;s or di&s;tance from the centre, and others of the like nature,
&s;eemed to me rather trifling than &s;erious or u&s;eful, and I could never
have the pa|tience to be better informed. Hi&s;tory, e&s;pecially ancient
chronology, &amp;c. ap|peared &s;o dark, intricate and liable to &s;uch
un&s;urmountable difficulties, that I never ex|pected to meet with any
&s;atisfaction in them, worth the time and pains they would co&s;t to learn,
&s;o that I was a long while before I could be induced to read Scripture
hi&s;tory, neither did I begin to be conver&s;ant in it till I came to have a
ta&s;te for the Hebrew tongue, which was not till many years after, and that by
mere accident, as I &s;hall &s;hew in the &s;equel. Church mu&s;ic, which was
then in great perfection by the encouragement which the worthy dean of
Chri&s;t-Church gave it, as well as by &s;everal of his excellent
compo&s;itions in <PB N="224" REF="226"> that kind, was the main thing that
capti|vated my vain roving fancy, and took up mo&s;t of my &s;pare hours,
though I was not a little a&s;hamed to &s;ee what drunken, idle ragamuffians
compo&s;ed almo&s;t every choir there, and with what indolence, to call it by
no wor&s;e a name, they performed their parts, except on &s;ome more &s;olemn
occa&s;ions than ordinary, as when the bi|&s;hop, or &s;ome per&s;ons of
di&s;tinction, ap|peared at the Divine wor&s;hip. The even|ing I commonly
&s;pent with &s;ome &s;elect company, but without drinking to exce&s;s, or even
to a degree of exhilaration, which I neither wanted nor was inclined to, and at
the u&s;ual hour of nine retired to my apartment. But here to make a &s;hew, at
lea&s;t, of retrieving the time I wa&s;ted a|broad in the day-time in company,
mu|&s;ic, &amp;c. I u&s;ed to light a candle, and let it burn the greate&s;t
part of the night in my &s;tudy, to make my neighbours believe I was plying of
my books; and &s;leeping in my ea&s;y chair, left the bed often for a whole
week as I found it, to the great &s;ur|prize of my bed-maker, who could hardly
imagine how I could live with &s;o little <PB N="225" REF="227"> &s;leep, and
without the u&s;ual benefit of bed refre&s;hment. Had I not been ble&s;&s;ed
with a &s;trong con&s;titution, &s;ea&s;oned moreover by two years fatigues in
the army, and by my living moderate and low, I might perhaps have felt the
&s;ad effects of &s;uch an irregu|larity, and I don't know but my
appre|hen&s;ion of it might be one main motive that induced me to make a &s;hew
of it, in order to give it the greater merit; for I began to pretend to have
&s;welled legs and feet, and a gouty kind of di&s;temper, which my friends
failed not to attribute to that, and earne&s;tly intreated me to &s;ubmit to
more regular hours and method of re&s;t. They likewi&s;e prevailed upon me to
go and drink &s;ome medicinal waters at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the city, it
being then the &s;ea&s;on, and a good deal of company of both &s;exes
re&s;orting to it; but as I knew my&s;elf to &s;tand in no need of any of
tho&s;e helps, I went thither only twice or thrice, rather for the &s;ake of
the company, diver|&s;ion, and mu&s;ic; but as my pretended lamene&s;s gave me
a kind of gravity, which I was not willing to part with, not know|ing how to
keep up to the one without the <PB N="226" REF="228"> other, I went &s;till
limping about like an old gouty fellow, though no man could enjoy a better
&s;hare of health and flow of &s;pirits than I did all the time I &s;taid
there.</P>
<P>It were a &s;hame for me to tell how idly I &s;pent mo&s;t of my
time, and how little progre&s;s I made in &s;uch a place, company, and among
&s;uch noble libraries, and learned acquaintance; for, excepting tho&s;e
lec|tures which I heard from my tutor, mo&s;t of what I got was by
conver&s;ation, but little or nothing by reading, except in books of
controver&s;y, almo&s;t the only ones that could captivate my roving mind.
Howe|ver, it was during my &s;hort abode here, (&s;carcely &s;ix months) that I
employed my lei&s;ure hours in correcting and revi&s;ing my romance of
Formo&s;a, and wrote the be&s;t an&s;wer I could to the objections that had
been made to the fir&s;t edition, in a &s;econd preface, which, all things
con&s;idered, met with much greater approbation than it de|&s;erved, from
tho&s;e few intimates I had &s;hewed it to; after which, taking my leave of all
my friends there, I &s;et out for London, where I &s;oon after publi&s;hed that
&s;econd <PB N="227" REF="229"> edition. At my coming to my old lodgings in
Pall-Mall, where Dr. Innes and I had for|merly lodged, I was told that he was
gone over chaplain-general to the Engli&s;h forces in Portugal. I had no
rea&s;on to regret his ab|&s;ence, for he had, before I went to Oxford, been
guilty of &s;uch notorious and barefaced immoralities, as well in this as in a
former lodging in the Strand, both tho&s;e of &s;ober and reputable families,
that his character had greatly &s;uffered by it, and he went a|way, ju&s;t time
enough to &s;ave him&s;elf the mortification of being &s;hamefully turned out
of this la&s;t, as he had been out of the former. Had I been, indeed, a real
con|vert from heatheni&s;m to Chri&s;tianity, it might have been truly &s;aid
of him, what our Divine Ma&s;ter &s;aid of the Phari&s;ees, compa&s;&s;ing
&s;ea and land to gain a pro&s;e|lyte, and making him ten times more wicked
than them&s;elves; and he hath been more than once &s;everely reproved by his
acquaintance, for the &s;candalous example he gave to me in particular, who was
admired by them for the contrary virtues. The truth is, he had an almo&s;t
in&s;urmount|able propen&s;ity to wine and women, and <PB N="228" REF="230">
when fraught with the former, fell immo|derately foul on the latter, whether
maids or married, not &s;crupling to u&s;e even vio|lence; which I particularly
mention, be|cau&s;e his behaviour in the&s;e, and &s;everal other re&s;pects,
to &s;ay nothing of what I have hinted in a former note, gave me but too much
cau&s;e to think that he had no real regard to religion, either natural or
re|vealed; &s;o that had I not been happily re&s;trained by Divine Grace, his
example would not have failed to have extingui&s;hed all &s;en&s;e of remor&s;e
which accompanied every indirect action I did, and confirmed me in downright
infidelity, in which ca&s;e I might never have been &s;o happily made
&s;en&s;ible of the error of my ways, as I have &s;ince been, nor ever repented
of them, till it had been too late. I have therefore great rea&s;on to
acknowledge it the greate&s;t mercy that could befal me, that I was &s;o well
grounded in the principles and evi|dence of the Chri&s;tian religion, that
nei|ther the conver&s;ation of the then free|thinkers, as they loved to &s;tile
them&s;elves, and by many of whom I was &s;everely at|tacked, nor the writings
of a Hobbs, Spino&s;a, <PB N="229" REF="231"> Toland, Collins, Tindal, &amp;c.
again&s;t the truth of Divine revelation, could appear to me in any other light
than as the vain ef|forts of a dangerous &s;et of men to over|turn a religion,
the be&s;t founded, and mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly calculated to promote the peace
and happine&s;s of mankind, both tempo|ral and eternal; I mu&s;t own, that the
&s;o|phi&s;try which perpetually runs thro' their writings, like the warp
through the woof, gave me but too much cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect their
&s;incerity, and that the inveteracy they &s;hew again&s;t the noble&s;t
&s;y&s;tem of mora|lity that ever could be thought of, to which all their
united force could never &s;ub&s;titute any thing better, or near &s;o good, is
but a &s;orry proof of their pretended love to truth, and to the good of
mankind, e&s;|pecially when I con&s;idered how fully and frequently their
writings have been an|&s;wered and exploded by better hands, with|out any other
vi&s;ible effect than that of their trumping up the &s;ame old trite argu|ments
in &s;ome new dre&s;s, and claiming a fre&s;h victory from them.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="232">I hope that what I have now wrote will not
be deemed by the candid at lea&s;t, as de&s;igned to proclaim my own prai&s;e,
&s;ee|ing it rather aggravates my guilt that I could act &s;uch a notorious
piece of hypo|cri&s;y, contrary to the &s;tronge&s;t convictions I then felt,
that it was impious and of|fen&s;ive to God. What I chiefly men|tion it here
for, is only to ob&s;erve, that it was that very conviction (which his good
providence would not &s;uffer to be quite extingui&s;hed in me, though he
per|mitted it to be &s;o long kept under by the impetuo&s;ity of my wild and
ungovernable vanity) that did at length co-operate with his grace to work in me
an utter abhor|rence both again&s;t that vile and dangerous pa&s;&s;ion, and
the &s;till viler crimes it had involved me in: for if &s;incerity is one of
the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential virtues of the go&s;pel, how abominable mu&s;t &s;uch
a long-wind|ed and multifarious di&s;&s;imulation appear to a guilty per&s;on,
when brought to a deep &s;en&s;e of it, however light it might &s;eem to him in
the more youthful and incon&s;iderate part of his life? Tho&s;e only who have
felt can judge of the &s;mart and horror of it, <PB N="231" REF="233"> under
which nothing could well &s;upport them but a &s;ure reliance on the death and
merits of a Divine Saviour, and a &s;incere repentance for, and dete&s;tation
of it. For as &s;uch a happy change can only be the work of Divine Grace, &s;o
it gives one a moral and comfortable a&s;&s;urance of pardon and acceptance at
the throne of infinite mercy, through the efficacious interce&s;|&s;ion of our
common Redeemer and eternal High Prie&s;t.</P>
<P>But though I occa&s;ionally mention it here, I would not have it
inferred from thence, that I began &s;o &s;oon to give way to &s;o &s;a|lutary
a remor&s;e. I was too young, vain, ra&s;h and thoughtle&s;s to be any other
way influenced by it, than as it put me upon finding out the mo&s;t
&s;en&s;ele&s;s excu&s;es and palliatives, &s;uch as every one may ea&s;ily
gue&s;s at, that hath been, like me, a &s;lave to youthful pa&s;&s;ions. So
that above half a &s;core or a dozen years were mi&s;-&s;pent in a cour&s;e of
the mo&s;t &s;hameful idlene&s;s, va|nity and extravagance; &s;ome &s;ort of
gal|lantry with the fair &s;ex, with many of whom, even per&s;ons of fortune
and cha|racter of &s;en&s;e, wit, and learning, I was <PB N="232" REF="234">
become a great favourite, and might, if I could have overcome my natural
&s;heepi&s;h|ne&s;s and fear of a repul&s;e, have been more &s;ucce&s;sful
either by way of matrimony or intrigue; which I have &s;ince the more wondered
at, con&s;idering my great pro|pen&s;ity to women was as &s;trong as my vanity,
and the opportunities &s;o many and inviting, and I &s;o little &s;crupulous
a|bout the danger or guilt of them; yet I may truly &s;ay, that hardly any man
who might have enjoyed &s;o great a variety, ever in|dulged him&s;elf in &s;o
few in&s;tances of the unlawful kind as I have done. This I am far from hinting
by way of pretence to a greater degree of virtue, of which no man could then
have a le&s;s &s;hare than I; for in tho&s;e few, wherein I was unhap|pily
engaged, but e&s;pecially one wherein my effection was captivated to an
immo|derate degree, no man pur&s;ued them with more eagerne&s;s and exce&s;s
than I did. But I am far enough from being inclined to entertain my reader with
a detail of my &s;ad irregularities and follies, either in this or other
re&s;pects, which I have long &s;ince looked back upon with &s;hame and 
<PB N="233" REF="235"> &s;orrow; only, with regard to &s;uch kind of unlawful
amours, I cannot recal to mind my &s;trong and vehement bias for them, without
thankfully acknowledging that there mu&s;t have been &s;ome &s;ecret
provi|dence that kept me from giving &s;uch way as I might otherwi&s;e have
done to the ruin of my health, circum&s;tances, &amp;c. or my being unwarily
drawn into &s;ome unhappy marriage, or other &s;nares, into which I have
ob&s;erved many a one le&s;s ra&s;h, extravagant, and incon&s;iderate than I,
have &s;o unhappily fallen into.</P>
<P>I was led into this &s;en&s;e of God's divine providence towards
me, by &s;ome (I may &s;ay) unavoidable ob&s;ervations on his gra|cious
di&s;pen&s;ations, in which it was im|po&s;&s;ible for me to be mi&s;taken: one
was, my meeting with an almo&s;t con&s;tant di&s;|appointment in my mo&s;t
plea&s;ing pro&s;pects, my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations and favou|rite
projects, whenever the end propo&s;ed was the &s;atisfaction of my predominant
pa&s;&s;ion, or the means to attain it were &s;uch as my con&s;cience condemned
as un|lawful; &s;o that I &s;eldom failed of reaping &s;ome pungent &s;hame,
mortification or di&s;|grace, <PB N="234" REF="236"> where I expected
approbation and applau&s;e, or with lo&s;&s;es and poverty, where I looked for
profit or gain. On the other hand, whenever I chearfully entered into any
laudable method of living that offered it&s;elf, or rather, which the &s;ame
good Providence threw in my way, I always met with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s,
and with &s;uch credit and approbation as made me ample amends for the
&s;truggles my pride made again&s;t it on account of its meanne&s;s. I &s;hall
take the liberty of giving a &s;ignal in&s;tance, becau&s;e it hath an
immediate connection with the impo&s;ture I was &s;till &s;triving to carry on,
and con&s;equently de|&s;erves to be expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I had been about five or &s;ix years in Eng|land, and lived in
&s;uch an extravagant and carele&s;s manner (if not in expences, which were
rather moderate than lavi&s;h, had I been in any laudable way of gaining a
competency, but which for want of that often run me into debt, without any
vi&s;i|ble way of extricating my&s;elf) when a plau|&s;ible way was offered to
me, by one Pat|tenden, of getting money, and credit too, by a white &s;ort of
Japan which he had <PB N="235" REF="237"> found out, and was then, in vain,
endea|vouring to recommend to the world, tho' it was really a curious &s;ort of
work. His propo&s;al was, that I &s;hould father, and introduce it, under the
notion of my hav|ing learned and brought the art from Formo&s;a; on which
condition, and my putting now and then a hand to the painting, he offered me a
con&s;iderable &s;hare in the profit. I readily agreed to his propo&s;al, not
only on account of the pro|fit we &s;uppo&s;ed it would bring, but much more
&s;o as it would yield a kind of convincing proof to the fabulous account I had
given of my&s;elf. We accordingly adverti&s;ed it under the name of White
Formo&s;an Work; and it was viewed and greatly admired by the curious for its
fine whitene&s;s, &s;moothne&s;s, and hardne&s;s, and for the beauty of the
other colours painted upon it: notwith&s;tanding which, and all the extravagant
encomiums we gave it, by far beyond what it really de&s;erved, and our care and
artifice to conceal its real faults, for &s;ome it had, we could never make it
&s;ucceed &s;o as to be gainers by it. And though our di&s;appointment might be
<PB N="236" REF="238"> owing, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to the va&s;t high price he
rated it at, contrary to my opi|nion, yet I have cau&s;e to ble&s;s God it &s;o
happily mi&s;carried, and was forced to quit it; for had the project
&s;ucceeded accord|ing to my &s;anguine hopes, it would have hardened me only
the more irretrievably in my vile impo&s;ture and &s;elf-conceit, but its being
&s;o unaccountably bla&s;ted, in &s;pite of all our endeavours to pu&s;h it
forward, did not a little contribute to in&s;pire me with a di&s;like to all
&s;uch unlawful and di&s;hone&s;t ways of getting of money, though this was not
the immediate re&s;ult of my di&s;ap|pointment; on the contrary, I grieved at
it, and at &s;ome other of the like nature, for &s;ome years, till the
frequency of them made me &s;ee clearly into the true cau&s;e of them, and
fully per&s;uaded me that nothing but an hone&s;t and &s;incere intention,
followed by the u&s;e of right and lawful means, could be attended with
&s;ucce&s;s; for I attempted &s;ince then &s;everal other means of getting of
mo|ney, which, though not equally odious as this, were &s;till blameable in me,
by rea|&s;on of my incapacity for them, &s;uch as the <PB N="237" REF="239">
practi&s;ing a kind of empyrical phy&s;ic, teach|ing of &s;ome modern
languages, &amp;c. of which I neither was a &s;ufficient ma&s;ter, nor capable
of a competent application to make my&s;elf &s;o. However, as I was hap|pily
di&s;appointed in them all, and as I had rea&s;on to think ju&s;tly too, it
&s;et me, at length, on a more hone&s;t and laudable &s;cent; and it was not
long before Provi|dence threw That in my way, which nei|ther my pride nor my
reluctance to a clo&s;e application, would have &s;uffered me to have &s;ought
after, or even thought of: for a coun&s;ellor of Lincoln's-Inn, who brought up
his three &s;ons and a daughter under his own eye, and had a better opinion of
me by far than I de&s;erved, &s;ent for me, and propo&s;ed to me the
in&s;tructing his &s;ons in the Latin tongue, and &s;uch other branches of
learning, as I &s;hould think them capa|ble of, at his own chambers. I readily
ac|cepted the offer, notwith&s;tanding the &s;alary was rather too &s;mall for
the charge, as I was to attend them twice a day, and &s;pend, at lea&s;t, three
hours with them every day, and lived at &s;ome di&s;tance from him. I was, in
about a year's time, honourably <PB N="238" REF="240"> di&s;charged, upon his
&s;ending them to be farther educated beyond &s;ea.</P>
<P>Soon after this I was recommended to be tutor to a young
gentleman, about eight miles from London: his father, who was an officer in the
army, had kept him for &s;e|veral years at &s;ome con&s;iderable &s;chools to
little purpo&s;e, for when I came to him, he could hardly tran&s;late one line
out of the plaine&s;t Latin authors, which he at|tributing rather to the
remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of his for|mer ma&s;ters, than to his want of genius,
re&s;olved to give him a home education. I found him, however, &s;o
unacquainted with every grammar rule, and &s;o aver&s;e to begin afre&s;h with
it, he being then near fifteen years of age, that I was obliged to acquaint his
father with the little hopes I had of him in the literary way, and pro|po&s;ed
the teaching him &s;ome other branches of learning, for which he &s;hewed a
rea|dier genius, and particularly fortification, which, as I formerly hinted, I
had learned from our indolent Je&s;uit, and of which I was become a pretty good
ma&s;ter, by con|ver&s;ation in the army, by &s;eeing a good number of
con&s;iderable fortre&s;&s;es in &s;everal <PB N="239" REF="241"> parts of
Europe, and more particularly by reading Vauban, Cohorn, and other emi|nent
authors on the &s;ubject. My propo&s;al was readily agreed to both by father
and &s;on, and the latter made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in it in a little
time, in&s;omuch that we had not only gone through all the theory of it, and he
could take any plan of a place, but had likewi&s;e made a model in clay of a
large fortified city, in which I had contrived to have a &s;pecimen of every
thing that related to the art of fortifying, both in the regular and irregular
way, en|gineering, &amp;c. and which, when fini&s;hed, was not a little
admired, not only as a no|velty, but likewi&s;e as a compleat piece of
fortification. The misfortune was, that my &s;alary was neither an&s;werable,
as I thought, to the pains I took with my pu|pil (whom I &s;till made, at
proper times, apply him&s;elf to Latin, and other branches of literature) but
likewi&s;e, through the ex|travagance of the father, very ill paid; which made
me &s;o much the more unea&s;y, as I had contracted &s;ome debts which I
&s;hould have been glad then to have paid with it. This, at length, determined
me <PB N="240" REF="242"> before the year was quite out, to accept of an offer,
which not only appeared more advantageous, but likewi&s;e more &s;uit|able to
my vanity, though it &s;o far di&s;o|bliged the gentleman's father, that he
made no &s;cruple to refu&s;e paying me what was &s;till due to me, and to let
me go from him with vi&s;ible tokens of his re|&s;entment.</P>
<P>This happened ju&s;t after the rebellion was broke out in
Lanca&s;hire and Scotland, anno 1715, on which account new troops were rai&s;ed
every where, and he became &s;o con&s;iderable and flu&s;h of money, that I
might have made my own terms to have &s;taid with him. But, by that time,
&s;ome of my friends had prevailed upon the ma|jor of a regiment of dragoons,
to make me the offer of being clerk to the regi|ment, and as I knew him to be
by far a much finer, and more generous gentleman of the two, nothing could
di&s;&s;uade me from accepting it. He could not, how|ever, prevail on the other
captains to make me clerk to their troops, that being, as they &s;aid, a
perqui&s;ite belonging to the quarter-ma&s;ter; but it did not hinder 
<PB N="241" REF="243"> him from retaining me to this, and mak|ing &s;uch
additions to the common &s;alary out of his own pocket, as made it near an
equivalent, and the friend&s;hip and regard he &s;hewed me, made me be looked
upon as a fit companion to the re&s;t of the officers, &s;everal of whom having
had a liberal education at &s;ome of the univer|&s;ities, it was not long
before we came in|to a kind of intimacy; there was, be&s;ides, another thing,
which procured me no &s;mall e&s;teem among them, viz. my becoming very &s;oon
acquainted with the clergy and other gentlemen in every place we came to,
e&s;pecially with the learned and curious, by which means I could introduce
&s;uch of our officers to them as were men of me|rit or character, as the
mo&s;t part of them were. But what added &s;till more weight to the re&s;t was,
that my friend, the ma|jor, who had often heard me called by the familiar
nick-name of Sir George, in &s;ome of the families where he had become
ac|quainted with me, after the peace of U|trecht, took it into his head not
only to continue the &s;ame &s;tile to me, but even to give it out, that I had
been knighted by <PB N="242" REF="244"> queen Anne. This la&s;t I was indeed
wholly ignorant of, for a long while, and denied it as often as the que&s;tion
was put to me, but was, however, &s;o fond of the fea|ther in the fool's cap,
that rather than fore|go it, I u&s;ed to lay a &s;tronger claim to it, under
pretence of my birth and family, for I &s;till pa&s;&s;ed current for a
Formo&s;an, and was as proud as ever of being thought &s;o, as it procured me
&s;uch an acce&s;s a|mong per&s;ons of rank and learning, which I likewi&s;e
made a means of bringing our officers and them into a familiar and agree|able
acquaintance, who might otherwi&s;e have been more than ordinarily &s;hy of
each other at that critical juncture. I might add, that as I was likewi&s;e a
greater favourite of the fair &s;ex, than any of the red coats, whom they could
not but look upon with &s;ome dread at that time, I had frequent invitations
from them, even tho&s;e of rank and fortune, who&s;e curio&s;ity would not
permit them to &s;uffer &s;o great a &s;tranger as I was to come, or even to
pa&s;s &s;o near them, without having the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing and
conver&s;ing with him, and informing them&s;elves in all the 
<PB N="243" REF="245"> particulars that related to him. And as I always took
care to behave in &s;uch a man|ner as might gain their e&s;teem, as well as
admiration, &s;o I could the more ea&s;ily in|troduce &s;uch of our gentlemen
as bore an unexceptionable character to them, by which means we had the
&s;atisfaction of &s;pending many a plea&s;ant day in their com|pany in the
mo&s;t innocent and agreeable manner, particularly in Lanca&s;hire, and, after
the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the rebellion, where we continued quarters, at Wigan,
War|rington and Manche&s;ter, in which la&s;t I had, moreover, the opportunity
of fre|quently vi&s;iting a noble library belonging to the collegiate church,
and well furni&s;hed with all manner of books that could be purcha&s;ed with
money: for it is endowed with 100l. per ann. to &s;upply it with new ones as
they come out, and yet, when I was there, they had above 500l. in bank, and
&s;carce knew how to lay it out, in|&s;omuch that they were thinking of
pur|cha&s;ing of &s;ome of the mo&s;t curious ma|nu&s;cripts. This, I could not
but ob&s;erve to them, was ill judged, con&s;idering the &s;itu|ation of it,
chiefly among trade&s;men, who <PB N="244" REF="246"> have neither ta&s;te nor
knowledge of &s;uch valuable pieces, and the few learned men in that
neighbourhood that could reap any benefit from them, and rather advi&s;ed them
to lay out that income in purcha&s;ing &s;uch valuable modern books, as were
yearly publi&s;hed both in England and out of it, and which, I thought, would
better an&s;wer the intention of the noble donor. They &s;eemed to acquie&s;ce
in what I &s;aid; but whether they followed my advice or not, I never enquired
&s;ince.</P>
<P>The&s;e allurements, &s;o &s;oothing to my na|tural vanity, and
our often moving from one county to another, made me &s;tay longer in the
regiment than I ought in rea|&s;on or con&s;cience (had I been capable of
li&s;tening to either) to have done, con&s;idering that I was of no &s;ervice,
but only a dead weight to my friend the major, who, be|ing moreover as bad an
oeconomi&s;t as my|&s;elf, would have been glad enough to have been rid of me,
though he never, either in word or carriage, gave me the lea&s;t hint of it,
but rather the contrary; yet &s;ome of tho&s;e friends of mine, who had
recom|mended me to him at fir&s;t, had more than <PB N="245" REF="247"> once
advi&s;ed me to ea&s;e him of &s;o expen|&s;ive a load; yet &s;o plea&s;ed was
I with this wandering and idle kind of life, which gave me an opportunity of
travelling through, and &s;eeing, &s;o many countries I &s;hould otherwi&s;e
never have been able to &s;ee, that I could not prevail upon my&s;elf to leave
the regiment, till it was ordered into Ireland, and then marched as far as
Bri&s;tol with them, and &s;aw them embarked for that kingdom: &s;o that I had
been, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, &s;omewhat above two years in this wandering kind
of amu&s;ing life, without reaping any other advantage than the &s;ee|ing
variety of places and people, and con|ver&s;ing here and there with &s;ome
learned men and books, though nothing &s;o much with the latter as I might have
done, if my indolence, vanity and the variety of objects which danced before my
eyes, had not diverted me from it.</P>
<P>Upon my return from Bri&s;tol, I was at no &s;mall lo&s;s how to
di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf for &s;ome time, and having had time to rumi|nate upon
my mi&s;-&s;pent time and idle life, was ea&s;ily induced, by &s;ome of my
friends, to alter my cour&s;e, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to get 
<PB N="246" REF="248"> into a way of earning a competency by my own indu&s;try,
rather than live at other peo|ple's co&s;t, or, which was much wor&s;e, on
their charity, which I could not now but look upon my&s;elf as a mo&s;t
unworthy ob|ject of; and, as I had a little &s;mattering of painting and
drawing, and had I been capable of a proper application, might, with
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, have attained to a con&s;i|derable proficiency in it, having
a &s;trong genius for, and no indifferent judgment in it. However, to go the
neare&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t way to work, I re&s;olved on that of fan painting,
which required le&s;s time and pains to learn; and had the profit been any
thing an&s;werable to my a&s;&s;iduity, I could have been contented to have
drudg|ed on with it &s;till. But that bu&s;ine&s;s was then at &s;o low and
contemptible an ebb, that, though I lived with a good fa|mily almo&s;t gratis,
and was early and late at work, yet I found it impo&s;&s;ible to get a bare
competency by it; notwith&s;tanding the encouragement &s;everal of my friends
and acquaintance gave me. This, how|ever, brought me acquainted with a worthy
clergyman; who, thinking the employ|ment <PB N="247" REF="249"> too mean for a
man of my education and parts, and that I might be&s;tow my time to much better
purpo&s;e in &s;ome kind of laudable &s;tudy, particularly that of di|vinity,
which I had always been mo&s;t fond of and conver&s;ant in, engaged to rai&s;e
a &s;ub&s;cription among his acquaintance, by which I might be enabled to
follow my &s;tudies with more ea&s;e. He did it accord|ingly, to the amount of
between twenty and thirty pounds per ann. which, with the help of a &s;mall
addition I got to it, by per|fecting of a young gentleman in the Latin tongue
and &s;ome other branches of learn|ing, made it a comfortable competency,
e&s;pecially as I was become, by this time, a better oeconomi&s;t, and had
fallen into a more frugal way of living.</P>
<P>But all this while this &s;ub&s;cription did lie &s;omewhat heavy
on my con&s;cience, and at &s;ome particular times gave me no &s;mall
unea|&s;ine&s;s, ina&s;much as it was founded on a belief of my being a
Formo&s;an, and a real con|vert to the church of England, which tho&s;e pious
&s;ub&s;cribers had not any doubt of, that I could find, even to their dying
day; for whenever I waited on them, I always met <PB N="248" REF="250"> with
the kinde&s;t reception and civil treat|ment that could be wi&s;hed. This
unea&s;i|ne&s;s &s;till increa&s;ed, as I now and then met with &s;ome people
at their hou&s;es, who&s;e behaviour and objections, though not in plain terms,
gave me but too much rea&s;on to think they had not the &s;ame charitable
opinion of me; and this put me upon va|rious indirect means to prevent my
friends being prevailed upon by them to withdraw their benevolence. This made
me often wi&s;h and pray, that I might but fall into &s;ome more hone&s;t way
of living without it, and free my&s;elf by it from that aggravated re|mor&s;e,
with which I was forced to receive it. But though I was fully per&s;uaded of
the guilt, yet I was not &s;en&s;ibly enough af|fected with it to make an open
confe&s;&s;ion of it, and how unworthy I was of their charitable opinion and
a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and con|tented my&s;elf with making &s;ome re&s;olutions of
giving up the latter, at lea&s;t, as &s;oon as I could get my&s;elf into a way
of living without it.</P>
<P>I became, at length, providentially I may &s;ay, acquainted with a
per&s;on who was concerned in various branches relating to 
<PB N="249" REF="251"> the printing trade, and in very good cir|cum&s;tances.
He was, moreover, a very generous and good-natured gentleman, and I became, in
a little time, &s;o great a fa|vourite, that he could &s;carce pa&s;s a day
without &s;eeing and con&s;ulting me about &s;ome of his affairs; and by his
means I came at la&s;t to tran&s;late books, and to get a comfortable living by
it. It was then I began to perceive, with no &s;mall joy, how God ble&s;&s;ed
my endeavours in propor|tion to my diligence and hone&s;ty, which made &s;o
lively an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, that I re&s;olved never to be concerned in
any works, that were either prophane, he|retical, or of a trifling nature or
ill ten|dency, and have accordingly refu&s;ed them whenever they have been
offered to me. From tran&s;lating of other people's works, I came at length to
print &s;ome of my own, and with the &s;ame laudable view, and have found
&s;till more credit and comfort in it, and more cau&s;e to ble&s;s the Divine
mer|cy, for the wonderful and unde&s;erved &s;ucce&s;s I have &s;ince met with.
But of the&s;e I &s;hall &s;peak in a more proper place; in the mean time I
&s;hall only ob|&s;erve <PB N="250" REF="252"> here, that my charitable
friends, dying one after another, as my bu&s;ine&s;s increa&s;ed, I never
applied to the &s;urvivors for a conti|nuance of their benevolence, but
declined it where it was offered, as being then able to live without it: and I
can only add, that though I once looked upon the&s;e &s;ub|&s;criptions as no
le&s;s unworthily be&s;towed upon, than ba&s;ely received by me, yet I have had
the comfort to ob&s;erve &s;ince, that they proved the happy means of freeing
me from a more laborious and unprofitable life, and of enabling me to follow
tho&s;e &s;tudies with more ea&s;e and chearfulne&s;s, which fitted me, in
time, for tho&s;e more arduous and beneficial ta&s;ks, which I have been
&s;ince engaged in; &s;eeing it was during the greater part of that time, that
I applied my&s;elf to the Hebrew tongue, and to the more clo&s;e &s;tudy of the
&s;acred books; by which means I had an opportunity of making a large
collection of critical and other remarks, which, though de&s;igned then only
for my own information, came at length to have a place in one of tho&s;e works
I &s;hall &s;peak of in the &s;equel, where they have &s;ince met with the
approbation of the public, both in <PB N="251" REF="253"> England and abroad;
though even under tho&s;e encouragements, and with tho&s;e op|portunities I
had, I mu&s;t own, to my &s;hame, that I was &s;till fair enough from &s;uch a
lau|dable application, as might have turned them to better advantage; and that
I &s;till mi&s;-&s;pent a great deal of my time in a loo&s;e, carele&s;s
manner, and that it was not till after a year or two that I di&s;engaged
my&s;elf from company, e&s;pecially of the fair &s;ex, though, one per&s;on
excepted, rather trifling than culpable, to follow my books more clo&s;ely. I
&s;hall therefore &s;kip all the for|mer part of my time, from the twentieth to
the thirty-&s;econd year of my age, as a &s;ad blank to every thing that was
good or laudable, and fraught with a di&s;mal variety of folly, indi&s;cretion
and other mi&s;carriages, which would rather di&s;gu&s;t than inform, or even
divert a &s;ober reader, to come to a more hopeful and in&s;tructive period;
and only ob&s;erve, before-hand, that it was no &s;mall happine&s;s to me,
(which, to what&s;o|ever owing, I ought at lea&s;t to attribute to my own
di&s;cretion) that the many learned and pious per&s;ons I was formerly, and
con|tinued &s;till, acquainted with, (for it was <PB N="252" REF="254"> with
&s;uch that I mo&s;tly cho&s;e to conver&s;e) were never acquainted with, nor,
as I could perceive, ever &s;u&s;pected me of being guilty of &s;uch a
&s;hameful, idle and &s;canda|lous way of living, but believed that I &s;pent
mo&s;t of my time to better purpo&s;e; el&s;e it is not to be doubted but I had
been di&s;carded and &s;hunned by them. In which ca&s;e I &s;hould have
entirely lo&s;t the mo&s;t ef|fectual means of coming into a better way of
thinking, which their conver&s;ation, ex|ample, and the many good books which
they lent me, did at length happily bring me to, and been left, like a
weather-cock, expo&s;ed to all winds: for though I could talk, and, at &s;ome
&s;erious intervals, think as &s;eriou&s;ly as they of religion and its mo&s;t
important duties, and even comply with them in &s;uch a manner, as &s;eemed
very delightful and edifying to them; yet was my roving heart &s;o far from
joining &s;in|cerely, or being affected with them, that I could ea&s;ily forego
them, to indulge any new ri&s;ing &s;atisfaction, though ever &s;o op|po&s;ite.
And indeed, &s;uch a frequent va|riety did offer it&s;elf naturally in my way,
as I was in no way able to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="255">Thus, for in&s;tance, it was natural for
tho&s;e intimates to introduce or renew &s;ome old &s;ubject or topic relating
to my pretended country, travels, conver&s;ion, or other ro|mantic part of my
life, which, however irk&s;ome it was then become to me to repeat, and as it
were to confirm anew; yet there was no way for me to avoid it, unle&s;s I had
at once acknowledged the whole relation to have been a notorious and &s;hameful
impo&s;|ture; and what a deadly wound mu&s;t have &s;uch an unexpected
confe&s;&s;ion given to my natural vanity? and what a mortification would it
have been, to &s;uch &s;incere hone&s;t people, to hear it from my own mouth?
&s;o that, could I even have had courage enough to forego the former, as I have
more than once thought and even re&s;olved to do, yet how could I find it in my
heart to give &s;o &s;en&s;ible a di&s;plea&s;ure to per&s;ons that had &s;hewn
&s;o much friend&s;hip and zeal for me? to &s;ay nothing of the dreadful
apprehen&s;ions of the con&s;equence of their charitable opinion being thereby
turned in|to a ju&s;t abhorrence and dete&s;tation. This was the &s;ad dilemma
I found my&s;elf in when I came to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on my 
<PB N="254" REF="256"> ca&s;e, and which made me conclude it, all things
con&s;idered, altogether impo&s;&s;ible for me to extricate my&s;elf out of,
without &s;ome miraculous power to a&s;&s;i&s;t me to overcome a pa&s;&s;ion,
which had hitherto eluded all the oppo&s;ition which my rea&s;on and
ex|perience had been able to rai&s;e again&s;t it. But what glimp&s;e of hope
of any &s;uch Divine help could &s;uch a wretch have, who, with his eyes open
to the guilt and dan|ger, had brought him&s;elf into &s;uch a dan|gerous
&s;tate? But God's mercy, which is over all his works, is not to be judged of
by us according to our narrow apprehen|&s;ions, but according to the gracious
ma|nife&s;tation he has given us of it in his go&s;pel; and as that
a&s;&s;urance gave me good grounds to hope, &s;o that hope in&s;pired me with a
de&s;ign to u&s;e all proper means to obtain it, and leave the i&s;&s;ue of it
to his Divine Providence. To him, therefore, I thankfully give all the prai&s;e
for his unde|&s;erved and &s;ingular ble&s;&s;ing on tho&s;e means which
him&s;elf directed me to, and what the chiefe&s;t of them were I have alrea|dy
mentioned, and &s;hall take notice of &s;ome others in the &s;equel, in hopes
they <PB N="255" REF="257"> may prove of &s;ervice to &s;uch as may &s;tand in
the &s;ame need of them as I did then.</P>
<P>However, I mu&s;t own, that the re&s;olution had &s;omething awful
and deterring, when I con&s;idered it in its full extent, to exchange the
delights of variety and multiplicity of company (which had been &s;o delightful
and in&s;naring to me till then, that no mo|tive or ob&s;tacle could keep me
from it) for &s;olitude and retirement; their bewitching flatteries and
commendations, whether for a fal&s;e merit I had a&s;&s;umed, or for &s;ome
valuable things they fancied in me, for a clo&s;er recollection and abhorrence
of my own vilene&s;s; to &s;pending of &s;o much pre|cious time in the gaities
and guilty vanities of life, for a more clo&s;e application and &s;earch after
the propere&s;t and mo&s;t effectual means of redeeming that invaluable jewel,
and the parcelling and be&s;towing it to the mo&s;t beneficial purpo&s;es; to
retrench not only all unnece&s;&s;ary and unlawful expences, but even &s;ome of
the common and nece&s;|&s;ary ones, in order to make &s;ome amends for pa&s;t
extravagancies, by &s;upplying the wants of tho&s;e many objects, that u&s;ed
to pa&s;s by unob&s;erved and unpitied by me. <PB N="256" REF="258"> The&s;e,
and other &s;uch like indi&s;pen&s;able preparatives, to the de&s;ired thorough
change, &s;eemed to carry &s;uch un&s;urmount|able difficulties with them, that
neither my &s;mall &s;hare of rea&s;on nor philo&s;ophy could have &s;upported
me to any tolerable degree in the re&s;olutions I was daily &s;triving to make
after it. And indeed, nothing &s;o effectually did it, as the con&s;ideration
that that Divine Providence, which had in&s;pired me with that de&s;ire, would
not fail of com|pleating it, if I was not wanting to my&s;elf; for that at once
&s;et me upon trying &s;ome|times one, &s;ometimes another, of tho&s;e duties,
with &s;ucce&s;s enough at lea&s;t to en|courage me to proceed.</P>
<P>And here I was again providentially helped by a worthy clergyman
at Braintree in E&s;&s;ex; who, good man, had a much better opi|nion of me than
I de&s;erved, and pre&s;ented me with that excellent book called Reform|ed
devotions, and recommended by the late reverend Dr. Hicks. This excellent book,
though then unknown to me, and di&s;reli&s;hed by &s;ome weak Chri&s;tians, is
&s;o well known to all the true devout ones, that I need &s;ay no more in
commendation <PB N="257" REF="259"> of it, than that it proved of &s;uch va&s;t
be|nefit to me, that I can never &s;ufficiently admire it, or the piety of the
compiler and reformer; for the many opportunities and invitations it gives one
of frequent and clo&s;er intercour&s;e with God, and of meditating, in the
mo&s;t exalted manner, on his various works, infinite mercies, and on all the
&s;ub|lime truths and duties of Chri&s;tianity, did &s;o effectually reconcile
me to that &s;olitude and retirement I had formerly been &s;o aver&s;e to, and
afforded me a mo&s;t noble refre&s;h|ment &s;everal times a day, from my
clo&s;e application to other &s;tudies I was then pur|&s;uing, &s;ome of which
being of the dry, others of the complex kind, might have gone but
&s;luggi&s;hly on without it. The late pious Mr. Nel&s;on's Method of Devotion
falling likewi&s;e, &s;oon after, into my hands, in order to be conveyed, by my
means, to a young gentlewoman lately recovered from a &s;tate of de&s;pondency,
I had the curio&s;ity to run through it, and found in it &s;uch ex|cellent, yet
ea&s;y rules for the conquering of our natural vices, and recovering the
con|trary virtues to them, that I made it one <PB N="259" REF="260"> of my
daily monitors, and with no &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>But that which gave me the greate&s;t help, was the learned and
pious Mr. Law's Se|rious Call to Devotion. This truly valu|able treati&s;e I
accidentally found on a cler|gyman's table, who, neverthele&s;s, &s;oon took it
out of my hand, and gave &s;uch a character of it, as might have di&s;couraged
me from looking farther into it, had not the place I had opened given me a
quite different notion of it. However, as I could not prevail upon him to lend
it me, I went and bought me one, and read it over and over, from beginning to
end, with greater eagerne&s;s and &s;atisfaction than any I had ever met with
on that &s;ubject. I was particularly much taken with the au|thor's motives, as
well as his method for the right u&s;e of our time, money, talents, &amp;c. not
to mention that his variety of characters and rea&s;onings upon them, which are
a continued appeal to the mo&s;t unbia&s;&s;ed and &s;ounde&s;t judgement,
which admit of neither cavil or objection, &s;oon opened to me a much better
way of applying them to ad|vantage, than any I had hitherto, or could 
<PB N="259" REF="261"> indeed have fallen into, without &s;uch an excellent
guide. The directions he gives for the obtaining of tho&s;e Chri&s;tian
virtues, which he there recommends as the proper &s;ubject for the &s;everal
hours of prayer in the day, may indeed appear to have &s;ome|thing too
technical (&s;ince it is no other than a daily renewing of tho&s;e very
de&s;ires, till them&s;elves become the virtues we want) from which too much of
the &s;ucce&s;s may, by the light and thoughtle&s;s, be a&s;cribed to the
method, and too little to the grace of God accompanying it. For may not, &s;ome
will be apt to &s;ay, an hone&s;t heathen or dei&s;t, by the &s;ame method,
rai&s;e him|&s;elf up into a habit of &s;obriety, cha&s;tity, &amp;c. without
any &s;uch application to, or parti|cular a&s;&s;i&s;tance from, the Supreme
Being? yet let any &s;erious per&s;on try the efficacy of it again&s;t any of
his favourite, e&s;pecially his con&s;titutional vices, and he will find, at
length, that he hath been only trying to wa&s;h a Blackmoor white, and mu&s;t
do &s;o to the end of the chapter, without the intervention of Divine grace. As
for me I &s;hall always, I hope, look upon the de|&s;ire it&s;elf, as well as
the &s;ucce&s;s of the <PB N="260" REF="262"> means u&s;ed for the obtaining
any virtue, to be alike the work of God in the &s;oul, let the&s;e be &s;uch as
Mr. Law directs, or any other, which Providence puts into our hands.</P>
<P>I had long before this, however, began to con&s;ecrate part of my
time to the &s;tudy of the &s;acred books, tho' not in that re|gular and
uniform manner as I happily fell into after reading the excellent directory
above mentioned, and had made a pretty collection of critici&s;ms, and other
ob&s;er|vations upon them, &s;uch as occurred on my reading of the various
commentators on them; and now it was that I became &s;en&s;ible, indeed, of my
own want of know|ledge of the original Hebrew, and to be|wail the lo&s;s of
&s;everal opportunities I had mi&s;&s;ed of gaining a more perfect know|ledge
in that &s;acred and u&s;eful tongue. For I had been &s;o di&s;couraged from
the pur&s;uit of it, by the difficulties I met with at the very thre&s;hold,
that is, in the gram|mars, that I never had the patience to go thro' one of
them, but contented my&s;elf with the interliniary ver&s;ions of Pagninus,
Arias Montanus, and other Interpreters; <PB N="261" REF="263"> chu&s;ing rather
to rely on their hone&s;ty and &s;kill, than to be at the trouble of becoming a
proper judge of either. It was not in|deed po&s;&s;ible for me to go on long in
this groping way, before their various inter|pretations of the text,
(e&s;pecially tho&s;e of &s;ome bold critics, which &s;eemed calculated to
unhinge, rather than confirm our belief, by exploding &s;everal, till then,
acknowled|ged facts and doctrines, or interpreting them in their own artful
way) &s;et me again upon making &s;ome fre&s;h efforts, for attain|ing a more
perfect knowledge of the original, which were however &s;oon damped by every
fre&s;h difficulty I met with in the common way of learning it, till I
providen|tially &s;tumbled, as it were, on the following ea&s;y method.</P>
<P>I was then hammering at an exercitation on the 34th P&s;alm,
printed at the end of the grammar that goes under the name of Bellarmine; in
which I found at almo&s;t every word &s;ome exceptions to the gram|mar rules,
and &s;uch rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for them as &s;till carried one farther from
the point in view; when a poor man came and offered me a pocket Hebrew
p&s;alter, with <PB N="262" REF="264"> Leu&s;den's Latin ver&s;ion, over
again&s;t each page. I greedily bought it, and finding the ver|&s;ion much more
ea&s;y and natural than tho&s;e literal ones of Pagninus and Montanus, quickly
went through every ver&s;e in the book, without troubling my&s;elf about
grammar, or any thing but the true mean|ing of every word as they occurred. So
that by the time I had given it a &s;econd reading, my memory being the be&s;t
faculty I could boa&s;t of, I had by that very rote, as I may call it, not only
gained a con&s;ide|rable copia verborum, but by ob&s;ervation on the flexion of
nouns, verbs, &amp;c. got a tolerable in&s;ight into the declen&s;ions,
con|jugations, and other parts of the grammar and &s;yntax; and, whenever any
difficulty or doubt occurred, could ea&s;ily turn to my Bellarmine or even
Bux&s;torf, the mo&s;t di&s;|couraging of all; becau&s;e, having then but one
point in view, I could, without per|plexing my mind with any more than that,
either &s;atisfy my&s;elf about it, or at the wor&s;t po&s;tpone it, till a
further reading and ob&s;ervation brought me to it: I became &s;o fond of this
method, that having gone through a third reading of it, with little or 
<PB N="263" REF="265"> no ob&s;tacle, and in a very little time, I re|&s;olved
thenceforth to confine my&s;elf to the p&s;alms of each day, as they are read
at church, and to begin with the hi&s;torical books.</P>
<P>Here, in&s;tead of perplexing my&s;elf with &s;uch Bibles as had
the &s;ervile letters printed in a different kind of character, to
di&s;tin|gui&s;h them from the radicals, I pitched upon the fir&s;t edition of
that of Mun&s;ter, which is far inferior to the &s;econd, and, by the help of
his ver&s;ion on the oppo&s;ite column, though often at &s;everal lines
di&s;tance from the original, had hardly gone through &s;ix or eight chapters
of the fir&s;t book of Samuel, before the ea&s;e I found in it invited me to go
back to Gene&s;is, and take every chapter in its cour&s;e. I re&s;olved at
fir&s;t to run them over once, without taking notice of his notes, becau&s;e
the greate&s;t part of them were either of the Ma&s;&s;oretic or of the
Cabbali&s;tical kind, and would rather clog than a&s;&s;i&s;t; and even in
the&s;e of the gram|matical &s;ort he lays all along &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s on
the punctuation for the true meaning and import of each word, as made his
ver|&s;ion the le&s;s to be depended upon. For <PB N="264" REF="266"> though I
always did and do &s;till look upon the points to be of &s;ingular help to
learners, and con&s;equently on the method propo&s;ed by &s;ome moderns of
teaching the Hebrew without them, as wild, intricate, and in &s;ome ca&s;es
dangerous, yet from all I had been able to gather from the learned au|thors who
have wrote on the controver&s;y, I was &s;o far from thinking them of the
&s;ame authority with the text, they plainly appeared of too modern a date to
be u&s;ed in any other &s;hape than as an expeditious help; and as &s;uch I
&s;till made u&s;e of them, without confining my&s;elf to them any far|ther
than they were &s;upported by the dia|lect, by the ancient paraphra&s;es and
ver|&s;ions, and other &s;uch critical helps, but made no &s;cruple to depart
from them whenever a &s;mall change of them could afford one a clearer or
better &s;en&s;e. And for that I &s;hall refer the reader to what I have
&s;ince wrote on that &s;o much controverted &s;ubject in the Jewi&s;h
hi&s;tory, which makes the &s;eventh chapter of the Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, and
e&s;pecially in the folio edition, where I had more room to expatiate upon it
than in the octavo one, in which our being confined <PB N="265" REF="267"> to
reduce the whole within the compa&s;s of twenty volumes, obliged us to be a
little more conci&s;e. I mu&s;t therefore here own with plea&s;ure, that all
that I there advanced hath been &s;o well received, and looked upon as &s;o
well grounded, that it hath not, that I know of, been &s;ince cen&s;ured or
con|tradicted; and that though the controver&s;y in favour of the antiquity and
authority of the points hath been of late revived with no &s;mall warmth, I
have met with nothing in it, nor heard from either tho&s;e I conver&s;e or
corre&s;pond with, any thing that could give me cau&s;e to alter my mind. I
&s;hall only beg leave to add, that my looking on the Hebrew points, both vowel
and gra|matical only in that view, enabled me to make many u&s;eful
di&s;coveries in the &s;acred books, which have been highly approved by tho&s;e
who have &s;ince read them in the hi&s;tory abovementioned.</P>
<P>But to return to my fir&s;t reading of the origi|nal books, I ran
with ea&s;e through the Penta|euch, Jo&s;hua, Judges, &amp;c. except the few
po|etical parts which occur in it, &s;uch as Exod. xv. pa&s;&s;. Deut. xxxii.
Judges v. .1 Sa|muel <PB N="266" REF="268"> ii. 1-10. where the &s;tile
is not only &s;woln and figurative, but where the con&s;truc|tion is har&s;h,
irregular, and to appearance truncated, and &s;everal terms which occur no
where el&s;e; &s;o that finding them too hard for me to &s;urmount, with all
the application I had, I po&s;tponed them to a future read|ing. I found
likewi&s;e pretty near the &s;ame difficulty in the Proverbs, Eccle&s;ia&s;tes,
and the Song of Solomon, and much more &s;till in Job; and therefore contented
my&s;elf with catching as much as I could at one cur&s;ory reading, and leaving
the re&s;t for hereafter; yet did not this di&s;courage me from going through
all the Prophets in cour&s;e, though it proved an arduous ta&s;k, and I went
but &s;lowly on, becau&s;e in the&s;e I endeavoured to make my&s;elf as much
ma&s;|ter of their meaning and &s;tile, as well as of the new words and
phra&s;es peculiar to them: and as I &s;pent generally &s;ome hours a day on
that &s;tudy, I had quickly gone through all the &s;acred books of the Old
Te&s;tament, excepting tho&s;e chapters in Da|niel, Ezra, &amp;c. which are in
the Chaldee, and where I contented my&s;elf at this fir&s;t reading, with
examining as well as I was <PB N="267" REF="269"> able, the difference between
that and the Hebrew. And here I own I found &s;uch a di&s;parity between them,
&s;uch a noble &s;im|plicity, and yet ma&s;culine energy in the latter, and
&s;uch an apparent &s;oftne&s;s and effeminacy in the former, not unlike what
is ju&s;tly ob&s;erved between Latin and Italian, that I believe nothing could
have tempted me to become more acquainted with it, had it not been for the
va&s;t helps which the Chaldee paraphra&s;e affords us, not only in fixing the
meaning of many ob&s;cure words and expre&s;&s;ions, but, what is &s;till more
va|luable, in di&s;covering the &s;entiments of the ancient Jews concerning
many pregnant prophecies of the Me&s;&s;iah, from which the Talmudic writers
have &s;ince departed out of di&s;like to him.</P>
<P>When I came to the &s;econd reading of Ge|ne&s;is, by which time I
had likewi&s;e ran through the P&s;alms five or &s;ix times, and was got again
into the hi&s;torical &s;tile, I found my&s;elf &s;o unclogged, &s;o acquainted
with the grammar and &s;yntax, and ma&s;ter of &s;uch a va&s;t number of words,
that I began to think I might begin to read the Latin into Hebrew; that is, by
hiding the Hebrew <PB N="268" REF="270"> column with my hand, try how I could
make my own agree to it. This I found however too hard and tedious, except in
&s;ome ea&s;y places or chapters, and I found my&s;elf not only at a lo&s;s for
the words, but mo&s;tly in the conjugating and &s;yntax, and though it might in
all likelihood have quitted co&s;t, had I proceeded regularly in that method,
yet I found it too tedious, as it took me above twice the time, &s;o that I
contented my&s;elf with only trying it now and then, when the humour took, or
the &s;ubject invited me to it. At other lei&s;ure times, I u&s;ed likewi&s;e
to exerci&s;e my&s;elf in conjugating of verbs by dint of memory and
ob&s;ervation, and then to compare it with tho&s;e in the grammar, by which I
&s;oon found out wherein I was deficient, and this I thought more expeditious,
diverting, and effectual, than the dull method of begin|ners, who, by dint of
hammering, learn them by heart, &s;carcely knowing what they are about. One
thing however I found would be a great help, viz. in all dubious words, as the
Hebrew is &s;o figurative and &s;canty, to have recour&s;e to the Lexicon, in
order to find out the primitive &s;en&s;e of them <PB N="269" REF="271"> from
the more remote, which it was ea&s;y to do by the parallel texts there pointed
at, where they occurred. This method duely attended to, opens a &s;pacious
in&s;ight into the true meaning of the &s;acred books. Thus I found for
in&s;tance in the words <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> Gene&s;is
i. 2. the &s;pirit of God moved upon the face of the waters, com|pared with the
motion of the eagle in &s;tir|ring her young ones to flight, Deut. xxxii. 11.
that the verb <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in the former in
its primitive &s;en&s;e, is not &s;uch a motion as our ver&s;ion expre&s;&s;es,
nor a brooding like that of the hen over her eggs, as &s;ome other
tran&s;lations intimate, but a lively agitation, &s;uch as much better explains
the action of the &s;pirit of God upon the face of the waters. This method,
which I preferred to the con&s;ulting that variety of ver&s;ions we have, which
rather confound than fix the &s;en&s;e, inabled me in my very &s;econd going
through the &s;acred books, to make a pretty large collection of &s;uch kind of
critici&s;ms and ob&s;ervations, as have been &s;ince of &s;ingu|lar u&s;e to
me in the progre&s;s of my &s;tudy, and in &s;ome of tho&s;e works in which I
have been &s;ince engaged, though I little thought then <PB N="270" REF="272">
either they, or tho&s;e which I made out of other authors that came in my way,
would ever come into public view.</P>
<P>I had by this time made &s;o great a profi|ciency in the Hebrew,
tongue that I could have talked it pretty fluently, had I been as well
acquainted with the pronunciation of it. But as that could not be attained from
grammars, which differed almo&s;t as much in the rules they gave for it, as the
native languages of their authors differed from each other, I thought it might
be more ea&s;ily attained by conver&s;ing with the Jews them|&s;elves, going to
their &s;ynagogues, and hear|ing the Scriptures read by their chazans or
mini&s;ters, who, I &s;uppo&s;ed, were perfect ma&s;ters of it. But here, to my
great &s;urpri&s;e, I found that they not only greatly differed among
them&s;elves, that is, the nor|thern from the &s;outhern, or German, Poli&s;h,
Hungarian, &amp;c. from the Spani&s;h, Portu|gue&s;e, Italian, &amp;c. but that
every one of them pronounced it after the &s;ame manner as they did the
languages of the countries where they had been brought up, and, as it plainly
appeared to me, none of them right. And this was farther confirmed to me by
con|ver&s;ing <PB N="271" REF="273"> with &s;ome Morocco Jews, who&s;e native
language being the Arabic, made me think they bid faire&s;t for having retained
the antient pronunciation in a greater degree at lea&s;t of purity; for &s;ome
of them whom I met with by chance in the Portugue&s;e &s;ynagogue, made a mere
ridicule of their way of reading and pronouncing it. And it was by conver&s;ing
with &s;ome of the&s;e, who were be&s;ides well acquainted with the Hebrew,
that I took my rules for a more genuine way of &s;peaking it: and it was no
&s;mall plea&s;ure to me to find, that I could be very readily under&s;tood by
all the &s;outhern Jews, though I could not &s;o ea&s;ily under&s;tand them, on
account of their not &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hing between the &s;ounding
of &s;undry con&s;onants, a&s;pirations, gutturals, &amp;c. which &s;eemed to
me to have originally differed very greatly; &s;uch as the
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> and
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> and
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> and
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> and
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> and
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &amp;c. but between which they do
not make any di&s;tinction, nor in|deed can, for want of having been taught it
in their youth. In the &s;ame manner do they murder it, when they go about to
write it in European characters, witne&s;s that Spani&s;h dialogue of the famed
R. Netto, <PB N="272" REF="274"> intituled
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> e&s;h dath, the legal fire, but
which he &s;pells, after his Spani&s;h man|ner of pronouncing, <HI>es dat.</HI>
However, after I had once been fully appri&s;ed of all the defects of their
reading, which &s;everal of them I have conver&s;ed with have had the
in|genuity to own as &s;uch, I could ea&s;ily enough under&s;tand both their
lectures of the Old Te&s;|tament and their prayers. But as to the nor|thern
Jews, I own I never could con|ver&s;e with them in that tongue, without an
interpreter, or &s;ome go-between, who, by the help of travelling into other
parts, had learned the way to accomodate their &s;peech to both ways of
pronouncing, &s;o much wider and uncooth is theirs to that of the &s;outhern;
and this was no &s;mall grief to me, becau&s;e I always found the northern more
learned and communicative, as well as more fluent and ready at &s;peaking that
&s;acred tongue; though that con&s;ideration was never &s;ufficient to induce
me to be at the pains to accu&s;tom my&s;elf to their way. Thus much I thought
might be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay with re&s;pect to the pronunciation of the
Hebrew, to which I &s;hall only add, that my method for learning and
pre&s;erving it <PB N="273" REF="275"> was by reading it aloud to my&s;elf, and
with the &s;ame exactne&s;s, as if I had been reading it to an
a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>But what contributed mo&s;t to this extraor|dinary readine&s;s of
&s;peaking it, was a me|thod I fell into at proper times, when I found my&s;elf
inclined to clo&s;e thinking, to cloath my ideas in that, in&s;tead of any
other language, or, as one may more pro|perly word it, to think in Hebrew
rather than in Engli&s;h, or any other language I was u&s;ed to. The P&s;alter,
which at my fir&s;t &s;etting up for this &s;tudy, I had read over for &s;ome
time, at lea&s;t three or four times a month, and afterwards con&s;tantly went
through once a month ever &s;ince, was become &s;o familiar to me, that I had
got it by heart; and as that contains mo&s;t of the radical words, as well as
idioms, which are mo&s;t in u&s;e, I &s;eldom was at a lo&s;s for either in
the&s;e my &s;oliloquies, or, if I was, I immediately endeavoured to call to
mind where I had read any thing like it, either in that or any other of the
&s;acred books, and by turning to it, if I could not readily recover it by dint
of memory, &s;eldom failed of fixing it there <PB N="274" REF="276"> indelibly.
By this means I &s;oon acquired not only a &s;urpri&s;ing fluency in it, but
could &s;peak it in the pure and elegant &s;tile of the &s;acred writers, and
now and then, upon occa&s;ion, rai&s;e it to the lofty &s;train of the poetical
books. This I was the more admired for, becau&s;e it was what few, if any, of
the learned among the Jews could do, who commonly marred their own by an
heterogeneous mixture of the corrupt Talmudic and Rabbinic words and idioms, to
which I was then in a great mea&s;ure a &s;tranger, nor could ever be
reconciled to after I became more ac|quainted with them. One may, indeed,
ob&s;erve almo&s;t the &s;ame difference between the former and the latter,
&s;ome few of the&s;e excepted, as there is between the Latin of the Augu&s;tin
age, and that which was in vogue after the inundation of the northern
barbarians into the Roman em|pire, as the reader may &s;ee by what I have
&s;aid of it in my Hi&s;tory of the Jews from their Di&s;per&s;ion after the
de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem to this time.</P>
<P>By what I have &s;aid hitherto of my me|thod of learning Hebrew,
any one may <PB N="275" REF="277"> &s;ee how ea&s;ily men at years of maturity
may come to as perfect knowledge of it, as the thing will admit of, and without
the di&s;couraging &s;lavery of beginning at the grammar, and may even make
that a plea&s;ing relaxation from other &s;tudies; and it is with a view of
le&s;&s;ening, if not al|together removing tho&s;e fancied difficul|ties and
di&s;couragements which have been the cau&s;e of that &s;acred tongue being
&s;o much, and, I may add, &s;o &s;hamefully neglected, by the clergy
e&s;pecially, that I have ventured to write &s;o far on that &s;ub|ject from my
own experience; for, let them think of or palliate it as they will, &s;uch a
neglect mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be condemned, by all who &s;eriou&s;ly
con&s;ider how impo&s;|&s;ible it is to come at a true knowledge, not only of
the Old, but I will be bold to &s;ay of the New Te&s;tament, without a
&s;uf|ficient knowledge of the Hebrew: the fir&s;t &s;eems to me
&s;elf-evident, and with re|&s;pect to the &s;econd, or New Te&s;tament, I need
only ob&s;erve, that the writers of it, though in&s;pired, and endowed with the
gift of tongues, did vi&s;ibly adhere &s;till to the Hebrew idiom in which they
had been <PB N="276" REF="278"> brought up, St. Paul him&s;elf not excepted.
Hence, the va&s;t quantity of Hebrai&s;ms that occur more or le&s;s in the
Go&s;pels, Acts, and in the Epi&s;tles, and which ne|ver can be rightly
under&s;tood or explained, but by having recour&s;e to the Hebrew idiom; but
this hath been &s;o fully di&s;|played by much better pens, that I &s;hall
&s;ay no more on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I have often wi&s;hed, indeed, that we had &s;ome more inviting
helps to that &s;tudy than we have, and &s;uch as might more effectually
contribute to overcome the a|ver&s;ion, or indifference, which our young clergy
&s;eem to have for it. And in order to contribute &s;omething more than a bare
wi&s;h towards it, I had once gone a good way in compo&s;ing a tragi-comic
piece, intituled, David and Michol, in Hebrew ver&s;e, wherein I introduced
this young prince&s;s, acknowledging with a &s;uitable reluctancy and &s;hame
to her confident, her new born affection for the young &s;hep|herd, after &s;he
had &s;een him unperceived from behind a curtain in her father's pa|vilion, and
heard &s;ome of the&s;e inimita|ble &s;trains with which he was wont to 
<PB N="277" REF="279"> enliven that de&s;ponding monarch in his mo&s;t
melancholy hours. The di&s;tre&s;s a|ri&s;ing from the apprehended rival&s;hip
of her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, who was &s;oon after promi&s;ed as a reward to that
brave youth, for kill|ing the vapouring champion of the Phi|li&s;tines and
Morabs, being repre&s;ented here as having already &s;ettled her affections on
Adriel the Meholathite, to whom Saul ac|tually gave her &s;oon after, contrary
to his promi&s;e (1 Sam. xviii. 19.) the different fears and emotions of the
two &s;i&s;ters, the means by which they came to under&s;tand each other's
ca&s;e and inclinations, the &s;in|gular affection of Jonathan towards David,
and the kind offices he did him with Saul, in order to procure him his beloved
Mi|chol, in&s;tead of her &s;i&s;ter; all the&s;e, I &s;ay, are repre&s;ented
in divers affecting &s;cenes, to which the energy of the Hebrew gives no
&s;mall beauty and pathos. The Epi|&s;odes, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of which
con|&s;i&s;t of &s;everal interviews and conferences between the prophet Samuel
and young David, as when he acquainted him with Saul's utter rejection, and his
being cho&s;en by God to &s;ucceed him in the I&s;raeliti&s;h 
<PB N="278" REF="280"> kingdom, David's &s;urpri&s;e, &s;cruples and fears, his
dread of entertaining even the mo&s;t di&s;tant hope of a crown, which he could
not obtain but by the mo&s;t unnatural and blacke&s;t trea&s;on again&s;t his
father-in-law, and his mo&s;t generous friend Jonathan, and the arguments by
which the prophet endeavours to &s;atisfy his &s;crupulous mind, that he
&s;hall enjoy the promi&s;ed crown, without the lea&s;t &s;tain to his loyalty,
and at length prevails on him to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be anointed king;
the&s;e, and &s;ome others of le&s;s importance, are not improper inter|ludes
to bring the piece to its happy cata|&s;trophe, his marrying the kind and
beloved Michol, and being ju&s;tly rai&s;ed to the command of the
I&s;raeliti&s;h army. To this I had added a literal ver&s;ion, which I
de&s;igned to have illu&s;trated with critical notes; but &s;ome avocations
obliged me to &s;et it a&s;ide for a con&s;iderable number of years, and when I
came to give it a fre&s;h reading, I found it to fall &s;o &s;hort of the
elegance and loftine&s;s of the &s;acred poets, with whom I was become by that
time much better acquainted, and a much greater admirer of, that I was quite
di&s;couraged from <PB N="279" REF="281"> improving or even fini&s;hing,
e&s;pecially when I con&s;idered the little likelihood there was of its meeting
with encouragement an&s;werable to the pains and co&s;t, at a time when one
might ob&s;erve the &s;tudy of that tongue to dwindle more and more vi&s;ibly
into con|tempt, among tho&s;e who&s;e duty and bu&s;i|ne&s;s it ought to have
been to cultivate and promote it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame mortifying con&s;ideration made me likewi&s;e &s;et
a&s;ide a de&s;ign I had formed, of compiling &s;ome &s;criptural Hebrew
Dia|logues, in imitation of the Latin ones of Ca&s;talio, and a &s;et of others
on more com|mon &s;ubjects, like tho&s;e of Corderius, tho' not &s;o puerile,
for the encouragement and diver&s;ion of young beginners; and a third between a
Jew, and a Chri&s;tian, on the mo&s;t material points of controver&s;y between
us, together with a collection and expo&s;i|tion of a great number of texts,
both in the Old, and New Te&s;tament, plainly foretelling the future
re&s;toration of the twelve tribes of I&s;rael, to their own Land, and their
embracing Chri&s;tian religion at the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t, towards 
<PB N="280" REF="282" MS="y"> the clo&s;e of the &s;ixth, or in the beginning
of the &s;eventh millenary of the world; for though that doctrine is, as the
Jews at Rome &s;aid of Chri&s;tianity, every where &s;poken again&s;t, (Acts,
cap. ult. v. 22.) I never found it to be &s;o but by men who, like the&s;e Jews
had never rightly con&s;i|dered it; whil&s;t tho&s;e who really have, (among
whom I have known &s;everal emi|nent divines of the church of England, and
&s;ome among the Di&s;&s;enters who were thoroughly &s;atisfied with it)
contented them|&s;elves with owning their belief of it to their intimate
friends, without daring to preach or promote it, for fear of being re|flected
or ridiculed for it. But I have had frequent occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve &s;ince
(vide Jual un He&s;tor, fol. edit. vol. i. p. 613, &amp;c. 8vo. edit. vol. iii.
p. 39. and above all, &s;ee the conclu&s;ion of their hi&s;tory, from the
di&s;per|&s;ion to this pre&s;ent time) that the Chri&s;|tians denying that
doctrine, is one of the mo&s;t effectual means not only of hardening the Jews
in their unbelief, but of unhing|ing one of the greate&s;t evidences of the
Chri&s;tian faith, &s;ince it cannot be proved in any &s;en&s;e, that any of
tho&s;e glorious pro|phecies <PB N="281" REF="283"> concerning the happy
&s;tate of the Jews under the Me&s;&s;iah, which are &s;cat|tered through the
Old and New Te&s;ta|ment, have been fulfilled; but that, on the contrary, they
have for the mo&s;t part been hated, per&s;ecuted and mi&s;erable, in mo&s;t
countries in the world, ever &s;ince the death of Chri&s;t. However, as I had
little en|couragement to hope that &s;uch a &s;ubject, written in Hebrew, how
beneficial &s;oever it might have proved, at lea&s;t to young be|ginners,
e&s;pecially by the help of the Latin ver&s;ion, would reli&s;h with the
pre&s;ent age, I likewi&s;e po&s;tponed it for &s;ome happier time, which is
not yet come, if ever I &s;hould live to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>I therefore contented my&s;elf with preparing for the pre&s;s a
new edition of the P&s;alms, with Leu&s;den's Latin ver&s;ion over again&s;t
it, and &s;ome critical and other notes for the u&s;e of the learners,
inter&s;per&s;ed here and there, with others of a more curious nature, on
&s;everal defficient places of that book, and mo&s;t of them new. To this I
de&s;igned a preface, that &s;hould give an account of the method by which I
had, chiefly by the means of the p&s;alms, attained to my know|ledge 
<PB N="282" REF="284"> of the Hebrew tongue, in the man|ner I have lately
related. I de&s;igned to add &s;ome further directions than tho&s;e I have
mentioned, with re&s;pect to the more ea&s;y attaining a readine&s;s of
under&s;tanding and &s;peaking it, one of which was, in the frequent reading to
change the third into the &s;econd per&s;on at proper places, and &s;o turn|ing
the p&s;alm into a kind of prayer, which, by rai&s;ing the attention, imprints
the words more in the mind, as well as familiarizes the conjugating of the
verbs, &amp;c. and this I found a great help to my progre&s;s, and was approved
by &s;ome judges, upon which I acquainted Mr. Palmer, of Bartholomew's Clo&s;e,
one of the be&s;t printers then in Eng|land, with my de&s;ign, and was
&s;urpri&s;ed one day on my coming to talk further about it, to hear that the
reverend Dr. W&mdash; had been there ju&s;t before, to treat with him about
printing a new edition of it, &s;aid to have been compiled by Dr. Hare, &s;ince
bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, who pretended to have found out the true metre of the
P&s;alms, and by means of that to have made a great number of con&s;iderable
di&s;coveries and emendations in the original. I knew <PB N="283" REF="285">
but too well how many excellent critics had already &s;plit upon that fatal
rock, and who, in&s;tead of correcting, had quite marred the Hebrew, by
di&s;torting, tran&s;po&s;ing and altering it at plea&s;ure, in order to bring
it to their model, to expect any thing &s;olid or &s;atisfactory from that
quarter, con&s;ider|ing e&s;pecially the character of the author. Nor was I
mi&s;taken, though this performance did not appear in print till &s;even or
eight years after, and then to my great &s;urpri&s;e. For Mr. Palmer had
amu&s;ed me with the belief that the de&s;ign was &s;et a&s;ide, either on
account of its being found impracticable, or at lea&s;t too difficult and
dangerous; for that, upon his applying to Dr. W&mdash; to enquire further about
it, he had received &s;uch eva&s;ive an&s;wers, as plainly convinced him, that
the author did not de&s;ign to go on with it, which &s;till confirmed me more
in my old opinion, that all attempts to recover the antient metre of the
&s;acred poetical books, were fruitle&s;s and lo&s;t labour. It appeared
however, as I &s;hall &s;how here|after, that Mr. Palmer impo&s;ed upon me, and
that he knew that the de&s;ign was car|ried on in another printing-hou&s;e,
though <PB N="284" REF="286"> with &s;uch privacy, that I never heard or
dreamed of it, though I had been long ac|quainted with Mr. Bowyer, who was
em|ployed in the printing of it. So far from it was I, that I began to think
Mr. Palmer had only invented that &s;tory to divert me from printing my
propo&s;ed edition, in order to &s;et me upon another work, in which he was
more immediately concerned, and expected greater credit, as well as pre&s;ent
profit from. This was his hi&s;tory of print|ing, which he had long promi&s;ed
to the world, but for which he was not at all qualified. However, he de&s;igned
to have added a &s;econd part, relating to the practical art, which was more
&s;uited to his genius, and in which he de&s;igned to have given a full account
of all that relates to that branch, from the letter-founding to the mo&s;t
ele|gant way of printing, impo&s;ing, bind|ing, &amp;c. in which he had made
con&s;ide|rable improvements of his own, be&s;ides tho&s;e he had taken from
foreign authors; but this &s;econd part, though but then as it were in embryo,
met with &s;uch early and &s;trenuous oppo&s;ition from the re&s;pective bodies
of letter founders, printers, and book|binders, <PB N="285" REF="287"> under an
ill-grounded apprehen&s;ion, that the di&s;covery of the my&s;tery of tho&s;e
arts, e&s;pecially the two fir&s;t, would render them cheap and contemptible
(whereas the very rever&s;e would have been the ca&s;e, they appearing indeed
the more curious and worthy our admiration, the better they are known) that he
was forced to &s;et it a&s;ide. But as to the fir&s;t part, viz. the hi&s;tory
of printing, he met with the greate&s;t en|couragement, not only from them, but
from a very great number of the learned, who all engaged to &s;ub&s;cribe
largely to it, particularly the late earls of Pembroke and Oxford, and the
famous doctor Mead, who&s;e libraries were to furni&s;h him with the noble&s;t
materials for the compiling of it, and did &s;o accordingly.</P>
<P>The misfortune was, that Mr. Palmer, knowing him&s;elf unequal to
the ta&s;k, had turned it over to one Papiat, a broken Iri&s;h book&s;eller
then in London, of whom he had a great opinion, though &s;till more
un|qualified for it than he, and only aimed at getting money from him, without
ever doing any thing towards it, except amu&s;ing him with fair promi&s;es for
near three quar|ters <PB N="286" REF="288"> of a year. He had &s;o long dallied
with him that they were come within three months of the time in which Mr.
Palmer had engaged to produce a compleat plan, and a number or two of the
fir&s;t part, by way of &s;pecimen of the work, viz. the inven|tion and
improvement of it by John Fau&s;t at Mentz; and the&s;e were to be &s;hewn at a
grand meeting of learned men, of which Dr. Mead was pre&s;ident that year, and
being his &s;ingular friend and patron, was to have promoted a large
&s;ub&s;cription and pay|ment, which Mr. Palmer &s;tood in great need of at
that time. Whereas Papiat had got nothing ready but a few loo&s;e and imperfect
extracts out of Chevalier la Caille, and &s;ome other French authors on the
&s;ubject, but which could be of little or no u&s;e, becau&s;e he frequently
mi&s;took them, and left blanks for the words he did not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>The&s;e however, &s;uch as they were, Mr. Palmer brought to me,
and earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed me that I would &s;et a&s;ide all other things I
might be then about, and try to produce the expected plan and &s;pecimen by the
time promi&s;ed, &s;ince he mu&s;t be ruined both in credit and pocket, if he
di&s;appointed his <PB N="287" REF="289"> friends of it. It was well for him
and me, that the &s;ubject lay within &s;o &s;mall a com|pa&s;s as the
con&s;ulting of about twelve or fourteen principal authors, and the
con|trover&s;y between Mentz and Harlem univer|&s;ally decided in favour of the
former, &s;o that I ea&s;ily fell upon a proper plan of the work, which I
divided into three parts, the fir&s;t which was, to give an account of the
inven|tion of the art, and its fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays by Fau&s;t at Mentz, and of
its improvement by fu&s;ile or metal types, varni&s;h, ink, &amp;c. by his
&s;on-in-law Peter Schoeffer. The &s;econd was to contain its propagation and
further improvement, through mo&s;t part of Europe, under the mo&s;t celebrated
printers; and the third an account of its in|troduction and progre&s;s into
England. This, together with above one half of the fir&s;t part, were happily
fini&s;hed, and produced by the time appointed, and met with more approbation
and encouragement from his friends than I feared it would, being con|&s;cious
how much better it might have turned out, would time have permitted it. And
this I chiefly mention, not &s;o much to excu&s;e the defects of &s;uch a
horrid perfor|mance, <PB N="288" REF="290" MS="y"> as becau&s;e it hath given
me &s;ince frequent occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve how many much more con&s;iderable
works have been &s;poiled, both at home and abroad, through the impatience of
the &s;ub&s;cribers; though this is far enough from being the only, or even the
greate&s;t inconvenience that attends mo&s;t of tho&s;e kinds of
&s;ub&s;criptions.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Palmer, his circum&s;tances were by this time &s;o
unaccountably low and unfor|tunate, con&s;idering the largene&s;s and
&s;ucce&s;s of his bu&s;ine&s;s, and that he was him&s;elf a &s;ober
indu&s;trious man, and free from all extravagance, that he could not extricate
him&s;elf by any other way, but by a &s;tatute of bankrupt, which cau&s;ed his
hi&s;tory to go &s;luggi&s;hly on; &s;o that notwith&s;tanding all the care and
kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his good friend Dr. Mead, a &s;tubborn di&s;temper,
which his misfortunes brought upon him, carried him off before the third part
of it was fini&s;hed. This defect, however, was happily &s;upplied by the late
noble earl of Pembroke, who being informed by Mr. Pain the engraver, Mr.
Palmer's brother-in-law, what condition the remainder was left in, and that I
was the per&s;on who had <PB N="289" REF="291"> wrote the former parts, &s;ent
for me, and, with his u&s;ual genero&s;ity, enjoined me to compleat the work,
according to the plan; and not only defrayed all the charges of it, even of the
paper and printing, but furni&s;hed me with all nece&s;&s;ary materials out of
his own library; and, when the work was fini&s;hed, his lord&s;hip re&s;erved
only &s;ome few copies to him&s;elf, and gave the re|mainder of the
impre&s;&s;ion to Mr. Palmer's widow, not without &s;ome farther tokens of his
liberality.</P>
<P>Before I leave this &s;ubject, I mu&s;t, in ju&s;tice to that
noble peer, give an in&s;tance or two of his genero&s;ity and &s;ingular
integrity. At my fir&s;t coming into England, I had had the honour to be
introduced to him, and to dine with him and other great per&s;ons in his
company, and had received no &s;mall tokens of his regard, till he conceived a
ju&s;t di&s;gu&s;t at one ab&s;urd fact I had affirmed in my fabulous hi&s;tory
of Formo&s;a, viz. the Greek tongue being taught there as a learned language,
which mon&s;trous ab&s;ur|dity &s;ufficiently &s;hewed my ignorance and
indi&s;cretion at the time of my writing it, and from that time his lord&s;hip
gave me up <PB N="290" REF="292"> for what I was, an impo&s;tor, and I &s;aw
him no more, till above twenty-eight years after, when Mr. Pine brought me to
him, in or|der to fini&s;h the book abovementioned. At my fir&s;t coming into
his pre&s;ence, his lord|&s;hip pre&s;ently knew me again, and reminded me of
my having been often with him, and of the rea&s;on of his taking a di&s;like to
me; upon which I readily owned the ju&s;tne&s;s of the charge, and of his
re&s;entment, which I begged his lord&s;hip to look upon as the effect of a
ra&s;h incon&s;iderate piece of youthful vanity, which I had long &s;ince
di&s;claimed, and condemned my&s;elf for, and a&s;&s;ured him, that I had
&s;ince then, I thanked God, fallen into &s;o laudable a way of living, as I
doubted not his lord&s;hip, if he knew of it, would not but approve of. Mr.
Pine confirmed what I had &s;aid; and his lord|&s;hip with his u&s;ual
affability and conde&s;cen|&s;ion, highly congratulated and commended me for
it, and was plea&s;ed to expre&s;s a more than ordinary plea&s;ure at it,
exhort|ing me to continue in the &s;ame good mind and way, and a&s;&s;uring me
of his friend|&s;hip and encouragement; and from that time I cannot
&s;ufficiently acknowledge his <PB N="291" REF="293"> extreme benevolence and
conde&s;cen&s;ion, in not only furni&s;hing me with all the books and other
helps I wanted, but in his generou&s;ly rewarding me for what I did; and when I
was forced afterwards to ac|quaint him that I was a per&s;on concerned in the
writing of the Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, became a &s;ub&s;criber and encourager of
it, as I &s;hall pre&s;ently have occa&s;ion to &s;hew. It was a little before
Mr. Palmer's death, that this work, the project of which had been formed by Mr.
Crockat, and the ex|cellent plan by the late famed Mr. Sale, met with an
unexpected &s;top, by an un|happy quarrel between the proprietors and the
authors, at the head of whom was Mr. Sale abovementioned, when I was
recom|mended to the former as a proper per&s;on to &s;upply the place of &s;ome
of the latter, who had ab&s;olutely declined being farther concerned in it.
This rupture happened &s;oon after the publication of the third number, anno
1730, when Mr. Pal|mer brought me the three printed num|bers from the
proprietors, and de&s;ired, if after having read them and the plan, I had a
mind to engage my&s;elf in the work, <PB N="292" REF="294"> I &s;hould give
them and the re&s;t of the authors a meeting at a place and day appointed,
which I accordingly did, and after having informed my&s;elf with their terms,
method, and other previous particulars, readily un|dertook to write the
Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory, in which I was the mo&s;t ver&s;ed, and for which I knew
my&s;elf already provided with a con&s;iderable quantity and variety of
mate|rials, which I had been collecting for my private u&s;e for &s;everal
years; and as I have been one of the chief per&s;ons concerned as an author,
not only in the fir&s;t, but al&s;o in the &s;econd edition, and &s;o was
perfectly acquainted with every &s;tep taken in the progre&s;s of the work, the
encouragements and difficulties it hath met with, as well as with the merit and
demerit of every part of it, I &s;hall make no difficulty to in&s;ert here a
faithful and impartial account of the whole, at lea&s;t &s;o far as it may be
of &s;ervice to the public, and prove a means of making any future editions
more compleat, by pointing out the many fal&s;e &s;teps which I found were
impo&s;&s;ible for us to avoid in the two former.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="295">And here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, in the fir&s;t
place, that though the de&s;ign was publicly pre|tended to be carried on by a
&s;ociety of learned gentlemen, yet in fact Mr. Sale was to be the &s;ole
conductor of it, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch ammanuen&s;es as he &s;hould
think fit to employ in the work. And though, in point of learning, no man might
be better qualified than he, for &s;uch an ar|duous and exten&s;ive
undertaking, yet his known &s;trait circum&s;tances obliged him to have &s;o
many other irons in the fire (to &s;ay nothing of his natural indolence, the
&s;ad effects of which, not only the proprietors of this work, but many others
of that pro|fe&s;&s;ion have &s;ufficiently felt) that it was im|po&s;&s;ible
for him to give it that attention which a work of that nature de&s;erved, much
le&s;s the di&s;patch he had engaged with them for, viz. the publi&s;hing
twenty &s;heets per month. Accordingly upon enquiry I could not find that he
ever wrote more than the fir&s;t number; which, though puffed up with the
&s;pecious pretence of a &s;econd edition, every reader ver&s;ed on the
&s;ubjects treated in it, might ea&s;ily know where he had got all his
materials ready <PB N="294" REF="296"> gathered to his hand; yet &s;o long was
he in publi&s;hing it, that his delay occa&s;ioned the fir&s;t
mi&s;under&s;tanding between him and the proprietors, which was however
fol|lowed by a greater.</P>
<P>The &s;econd and third numbers, which ap|peared afterwards to have
been written by his two ammanuen&s;es, till then unknown to the partners, came
out indeed more regularly; but the proprietors, who had already paid Mr. Sale
for them, were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed when the two young authors (whom I
forbear naming, becau&s;e they are both alive and make a good figure, the one
in a high po&s;t, and the other in the commonwealth of learning) came and
demanded the money for their copy. The propietors did indeed produce his
receipts for much greater &s;ums than the three numbers could amount to, but
though they knew that he was not in a capacity to pay them, they refu&s;ed to
make a &s;econd di&s;bur&s;ement for what they had more than payed for,
whil&s;t the &s;ufferers, on the other hand, refu&s;ed to go on further with
the work, till they were &s;atisfied for what they had done. The partners
&s;tiffly refu&s;ing to comply, the re&s;ult was, that one of them 
<PB N="295" REF="297"> not only quite declined all further meddling in the
work, but vented his re&s;entment by crying it down, and all the per&s;ons
con|cerned in it, authors as well as proprietors. Mr. Sale was &s;till more
outrageous again&s;t them, of whom the latter had taken a note of 72 pounds,
payable on demand, for money overpaid, and the embezzlement of a con&s;iderable
number of books, which they had furni&s;hed him to carry on the de&s;ign. This
note was probably taken with a view of keeping him in awe, but neither that nor
their threats could contain him within bounds, &s;o that he became a mo&s;t
inveterate enemy to the de&s;ign, and did all he could to di&s;|credit and
ob&s;truct it.</P>
<P>This was the hopele&s;s &s;ituation of the work at my fir&s;t
being invited to it, and again&s;t which I cannot forbear mentioning an|other
di&s;couragement, viz. the freedom which the authors of the foregoing part had
taken in reflecting, as often as they had op|portunity, again&s;t the Mo&s;aic
account, e&s;pe|cially in the hi&s;tory of the antient Canaan|ites, where God
is recorded to have treated them with &s;uch &s;everity in favour of the
I&s;raelites, and where they made no diffi|culty <PB N="296" REF="298"> to
reflect upon that partiality, as incon|&s;i&s;tent with the divine ju&s;tice
and goodne&s;s towards a favourite nation, who are there repre&s;ented as by
far the wor&s;e of the two: for, as I took the liberty to ob&s;erve to them,
be&s;ides that all the objections again&s;t the divine conduct in this
particular have been &s;o often and &s;o effectually an&s;wered by learned
divines, that there can be no ju&s;tifi|able rea&s;on given for reviving them
here, this manner of treating Mo&s;es's writings is far below the regard that
&s;uch an antient and celebrated author may challenge, ab|&s;tractedly even
from his being acknowledged an in&s;pired penman, by Jews, Turks and
Chri&s;tians. And therefore added, I will never engage in the work, unle&s;s
you will allow me to follow the oppo&s;ite tract, and, in&s;tead of reflecting,
to vindicate both his character and writings, as often as occa&s;ion offers,
either from the works of our be&s;t divines, or from &s;undry new
ob&s;ervations I have had opportunity to make on the books of that divine
lawgiver. I much que&s;tion, if they had not been at &s;uch a nonplus for a
hand to go immediately upon the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory, whether they would have
ever <PB N="297" REF="299"> yielded to the&s;e terms, &s;uch was their opinion
of Mr. Sale, whom they knew had no great regard for the Old Te&s;tament, and
who had long ago in&s;pired one, if not both of his ammanuen&s;es with a mo&s;t
outrageous zeal again&s;t it. However, I got them with &s;ome trouble to
acquie&s;ce, and let me take my own way, only Mr. Provo&s;t, then one of the
partners, begged it as a favour of me, that I <HI>would not be righteous over
much.</HI></P>
<P>I gave them &s;oon after good cau&s;e to be &s;atisfied with my
advice and conduct, and the unexpected encouragement which the work met with,
after the regular publica|tion of two or three numbers of the Jewi&s;h
hi&s;tory (to &s;ay nothing of the commenda|tions given to it in print, by two
&s;uch learned per&s;ons as Dr. Chapman, chaplain to his grace of Canterbury,
and Dr. Pearce, rector of St. Martin's in the fields) rai&s;ed it into &s;uch
reputation and vogue, that they no longer doubted of its &s;ucce&s;s;
in&s;o|much that they began now to enlarge the edition from 750 to 1000. And
this I mention with plea&s;ure, becau&s;e the great call there was for it from
that time, to what they had found before, when the numbers 
<PB N="298" REF="300"> were returned to them by dozens from other
book&s;ellers, plainly &s;hewed how few encouragers it would have met with
among the freethinkers and unbelievers, to what it did among tho&s;e of a
different, and I may add, of a better way of thinking. There was indeed one
main objection made, viz. my cla&s;hing with tho&s;e who had gone be|fore me;
and I remember more particularly, that the late earl of Pembroke (who, as I
lately hinted, was an encourager of the work, and to whom I was obliged to
ex|cu&s;e my not waiting &s;o often on him as he de&s;ired, in order to
fini&s;h the third part of Mr. Palmer's hi&s;tory above mentioned, by
acquainting his lord&s;hip that much of my time was taken up with the
Univer&s;al Hi&s;|tory, in which I was engaged) expre&s;&s;ed no &s;mall
di&s;like at this contra&s;t, or, as he was plea&s;ed to call it, chequer-work
between the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory, and &s;ome of the num|bers that preceded it;
the one expre&s;&s;ing all along an unaccountable di&s;regard for the Mo&s;aic
writings, whil&s;t the other took all proper occa&s;ion to vindicate them, in a
manner which he was plea&s;ed to call &s;o very laudable and ju&s;t; upon which
I was <PB N="299" REF="301"> forced to acquaint his lord&s;hip, that the former
part had been printed &s;ome time before I was concerned in the work, and
written by per&s;ons in a very different way of thinking from me, and which I
had publicly di&s;allowed; but as they had &s;ince declined the work, the
proprietors had left me wholly at my liberty to take my own way, which I was
fully determined to pur|&s;ue to the end, &s;o that there would be no more
&s;uch contradictions to be found in the &s;equel, becau&s;e all that related
to the Jewi&s;h nation down to their di&s;per&s;ion at the de|&s;truction of
Jeru&s;alem, or even from that to the pre&s;ent time, if we were encouraged to
continue it, would fall to my &s;hare; and that tho&s;e who were to write the
hi&s;to|ries of the A&s;&s;yrians, Medes, Per&s;ians, and other nations which
had any connection with the Jewi&s;h, &s;hould be obliged to fol|low the &s;ame
tract, and acknowledge the divine authority of the Old Te&s;tament. This his
lord&s;hip highly approved, and as to the remaining difficulty, viz. the
reconciling what was already printed, and he thought pa&s;t remedying, I told
his lord&s;hip, that the greate&s;t part of the&s;e early numbers having 
<PB N="300" REF="302"> been mi&s;laid, and &s;o bandied about and wa&s;ted that
there would be &s;peedily a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of reprinting them, I would engage
to revi&s;e and correct them, &s;o as to make the whole uniform, which was
&s;oon after done accordingly. But when, for the credit of the work, I
propo&s;ed to the proprietors the calling in of the old numbers, and giving the
purcha&s;ers the new ones in lieu of them, the greater part of them lent a deaf
ear to it, alledging, that they were &s;o much out of pocket already, that they
could not afford to de&s;troy &s;o great a number of copies for the &s;ake of
uniformity, and that the work mu&s;t take its chance without it.</P>
<P>This was not the only in&s;tance in which they &s;tood in their
own light; I &s;hall beg leave to add one or two more. Before the ninth number
of the fir&s;t volume had been publi&s;hed, they had received &s;everal letters
from the learned both at home and abroad, directed to the authors,
particu|larly two from Holland, the one from a per&s;on who tran&s;lated our
hi&s;tory into French, and the other into Dutch, and publi&s;hed them there
regularly every month, as we did here. The&s;e, among other com|mendations 
<PB N="301" REF="303"> and encouragements, de&s;ired us to &s;end them the
&s;heets as fa&s;t as printed here, for the better di&s;patch of their
ver|&s;ion, and keeping time with us; offering to make any rea&s;onable
&s;atisfaction for it, and to promote the credit and &s;ale of the Engli&s;h
original on the other &s;ide the water. The Dutch tran&s;lator in particular,
who was a man of learning and character, ac|quainted us, not without a
hand&s;ome and mode&s;t apology, with &s;ome alterations and deviations he had
taken the liberty to make from our printed copy, in the three or four fir&s;t
numbers, and de&s;ired us above all things to &s;ettle a corre&s;pondence with
him, that we might freely communicate our thoughts to one another, promi&s;ing
to &s;end us, at the conclu&s;ion of each volume a copy, of his ver&s;ion, with
the alterations marked in the margin, and the &s;entiments of the learned
beyond &s;ea; about the work which he accordingly did at the clo&s;e of his
fir&s;t volume, though we had not been able to prevail upon the proprietors to
&s;end them the &s;heets in the manner above de&s;ired, and were not willing to
do it without their con|&s;ent, they being all apprehen&s;ive that the&s;e 
<PB N="302" REF="304"> would hinder the &s;ale of the Engli&s;h original there.
We tried in vain to con|vince them of the contrary, by &s;hewing them that it
would rather forward it, by making it more known and famed abroad; for that not
only the Engli&s;h there, but likewi&s;e tho&s;e who under&s;tood that
lan|guage, would &s;till chu&s;e to read it in the original rather than in a
ver&s;ion. I like|wi&s;e tried to make them &s;en&s;ible how ne|ce&s;&s;ary and
u&s;eful &s;uch a corre&s;pondence would be to us, and how much it would in all
likelihood contribute to the credit and re|putation of the work, and what need
we &s;tood in to u&s;e all proper helps, in a work of &s;o arduous and
exten&s;ive a nature. The only thing they would agree to, was that we might, if
we thought fit, &s;till corre&s;pond with them, (and that they knew we could do
without their leave) but as to the &s;ending the &s;heets as &s;oon as printed,
they ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed; &s;o that we were forced to put an end to the one
for want of being able to comply with the other.</P>
<P>The next in&s;tance I &s;hall give is &s;till of a more &s;ordid
nature. They were obliged to furni&s;h us with all nece&s;&s;ary books 
<PB N="303" REF="305"> for the work, and on my fir&s;t going upon the Jewi&s;h
hi&s;tory, I &s;ent them a li&s;t of &s;uch as were really wanted, though
&s;ome of them very con&s;iderable both in bulk and value, &s;uch as the
Thalmuds, Polyglott, Opera Criticorum, &amp;c. and was &s;urpri&s;ed at the
difficulties they made, and objections they rai&s;ed again&s;t both the number
and charge of them, alledging on the one hand the va&s;t number of them that
had been for|merly embezzled and lo&s;t, which they pre|tended to amount to
near 200<HI>l.</HI> and on the other, the va&s;t expence they had already been
at, and the little returns made for it in the four fir&s;t numbers; &s;o that
if I would not di&s;pen&s;e with a good number of the deare&s;t &s;ort, they
were afraid they mu&s;t de&s;i&s;t from proceeding farther. It was well for
them, as well as me, that I had then a free acce&s;s to Sion College library,
by an order from the pre&s;ident and &s;ome of the heads of that &s;ociety, and
which I had made u&s;e of for &s;ome years, whenever I &s;tood in need of it;
&s;o that I readily engaged to &s;trike out all tho&s;e that I &s;hould find
there, provided they would promi&s;e to find me all the re&s;t. By which means,
as well as by the <PB N="304" REF="306"> kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my good
friend the re|verend Mr. Reading, the late worthy library-keeper, who having
the goodne&s;s to bring me all the books I called for, without the trouble of
my looking out for them in their re&s;pective &s;helves, to my writ|ing de&s;k
at the farther end of the li|brary, I could with ea&s;e con&s;ult all my
au|thors, make what extracts I wanted out of them, after which he took the
pains of returning them to their proper places.</P>
<P>Now as this &s;aved the book&s;ellers the buy|ing of near, if not
more than 100<HI>l.</HI> worth of books, and me a great deal of trouble, (for
Mr. Reading did mo&s;t frequently enquire of me what part of a book I
de|&s;igned to con&s;ult, and being well acquainted with mo&s;t of them,
brought them to me opened at the very place I wanted, which enabled me to make
more di&s;patch, and to keep up to the time of publication) I in|&s;i&s;ted at
one of our meetings, and I thought ju&s;tly too, that they &s;hould, by way of
acknowledgement, pre&s;ent either the library, or the worthy keeper of it, with
a &s;et of volumes, as &s;oon as they come out, which, I told them, might
likewi&s;e be a means of <PB N="305" REF="307"> recommending the work to
tho&s;e divines and others that frequented that place. They all &s;eemed
readily to agree to the propo&s;al, and I acquainted Mr. Reading, who was not a
little plea&s;ed with it, and told me, that, for his part, he was very ready to
do all he could to promote our de&s;ign, without any &s;uch view, though he
&s;aid that he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee it pre|&s;ented to the library, as it
was a work which he much approved as far as we had gone, the chronology
excepted, to which he thought that of the learned U&s;her va&s;tly preferable.
I told him I was wholly of his opinion, and was &s;orry Mr. Sale had ever fixed
upon this, but that it was done before I was concerned in the work, and could
not now be retrieved, at lea&s;t in this fir&s;t edition, but by the readers
making up the difference either in their mind or with the pen. I added, that I
had rea&s;on to believe, that if the work came ever to be reprinted, we
&s;hould exchange it for that of Archbi&s;hop U&s;her, as we have actually
done. However, as &s;oon as the fir&s;t part of the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory was
printed off, I took a little rece&s;s among &s;ome of my <PB N="306" REF="308">
friends in Hamp&s;hire, where I compleated my next ta&s;k, viz. the hi&s;tory
of the Celtes and the Scythians, and as I had the free u&s;e of &s;everal
libraries there, I &s;aved the proprietors the charge of buying tho&s;e books I
was &s;ure to find in any of them, and as &s;oon as I found by the public
papers, that the fir&s;t volume was publi&s;hed, wrote a letter to put them in
mind of their promi&s;e of pre&s;enting one of them to Sion College library;
but I was much &s;urpri&s;ed at my coming to town, to find that they had
ab&s;olutely re&s;olved again&s;t it, on pre|tence that it might hinder many
clergymen from buying it, if they could have the reading of it there. I tried
in vain to fore|warn them that I &s;hould want mo&s;t of the &s;ame &s;carce
and chargeable books, be&s;ides a number of others, for the writing the
&s;econd part of the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory, in a &s;ub&s;equent volume, in which
ca&s;e they could not expect that I &s;hould again have recour&s;e to my good
friend Mr. Reading, but mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be at the expence of buying
them; they cho&s;e to run the hazard of it, and I took care not to &s;pare them
in one of them, when it came to the point.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="309">From the&s;e few in&s;tances, the reader may
ea&s;ily gue&s;s that the then partners were not quite &s;o &s;olicitous for
the credit of the work, as might have been wi&s;hed, con|&s;idering how well it
took by this time. But I mu&s;t in ju&s;tice to them acquaint him, that
(be&s;ides the great difficulties they la|boured under to procure proper hands
to go on with it, and for which I refer him to what I have &s;aid in the
dedication and preface to the la&s;t volume of the folio edi|tion) they had met
with many unexpected and con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es; &s;ome of the newly engaged
authors, for in&s;tance took up pretty round &s;ums before-hand, and never
wrote a line of the part they had undertaken; others, even among the old ones,
wrote theirs in &s;uch a carele&s;s manner as not to be fit to appear in print,
when they came to be examined by the re&s;t, and yet were paid the &s;ame to
the full as if their copy had pa&s;&s;ed mu&s;ter, though the whole was to be
done again <HI>de novo,</HI> and the re|tarding of the work was an additional
lo&s;s to the proprietors. I will add, that I have &s;ince known near twenty
&s;heets of the be|ginning of the Byzantine hi&s;tory, done by 
<PB N="308" REF="310" MS="y"> a judicious hand, and printed off, yet con|demned
to wa&s;te paper chiefly becau&s;e it was &s;pun to too great a length, which
was &s;till a much greater lo&s;s. The truth is, that the author of the Roman
hi&s;tory, hav|ing wire-drawn it to above three times the length it was to have
been, there was an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of curtailing that of the
Con&s;tantinopolitan emperors, to prevent the work &s;welling into an enormous
bulk; and he him&s;elf hath abridged it in &s;uch a manner as hath quite marred
it, &s;ince the reader will find mo&s;t reigns contained in as many &s;hort
paragraphs as they would have required &s;heets, which is &s;o much the greater
lo&s;s to the public, ina&s;much as the Roman hi&s;tory being &s;o well known,
and written by &s;o many hands, was the fitte&s;t to have been thus
epitomi&s;ed; whereas the Byzantine, though equally curious and in&s;tructive,
is &s;o little known, that it ought to have been written in a more copious
manner, e&s;pecially as it abounds with the mo&s;t intere&s;ting incidents to
the church as well as the &s;tate. So that the author hath done in both
re&s;pects <PB N="309" REF="311"> the very rever&s;e of what he ought to have
done.</P>
<P>The reader may, from the in&s;tances above mentioned, &s;uppo&s;e
perhaps, that we the au|thors kept con&s;tantly to our meetings and ex|amining
each part in a body, as we u&s;ed to do at fir&s;t &s;etting out, a method of
the greate&s;t con&s;equence towards the carrying on &s;uch a work, and which
the proprietors were not wanting in genero&s;ity to promote; but we &s;oon
found the new comers &s;o aver&s;e to continue it, or &s;ubmit the review of
their copy to the old ones, that they either ab&s;ented them&s;elves from our
meetings, or el&s;e conde&s;cended only to an&s;wer &s;uch que&s;tions as were
a&s;ked them by the old ones concerning their fixing any point of hi&s;tory,
which had a connection with that of another nation; as the Macedonians and
Greeks, for in&s;tance, done by two or three hands, to prevent our cla&s;hing
with each other about uncertain or controverted facts; in every re&s;pect, they
in&s;i&s;ted on going on each in his own way, as they were, they told us,
&s;ufficiently acquainted with the &s;ubject they had in hand. By this means it
was that they indulged them&s;elves in the <PB N="310" REF="312"> liberty of
going beyond their bounds, and &s;welling each part to double the bulk agreed
on, by often repeating the &s;ame common facts in each &s;eparate hi&s;tory,
which we had agreed &s;hould be related at length but in its proper place,
whil&s;t every other occa|&s;ion that offered for fre&s;h mention of them, was
to be only referred to that, either as promi&s;cua to follow in the &s;equel,
or as a reference to what hath already been &s;aid.</P>
<P>For we had from the beginning agreed upon this method, that
nothing &s;hould be related at length concerning the hi&s;tory of any nation or
country, but what was tran&s;|acted within the boundaries of it; and that the
wars, conque&s;ts, &amp;c. which were car|ried on abroad, &s;hould be mentioned
chiefly in the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e countries where they were made; to do
otherwi&s;e, would be, as was hinted at the beginning of the fir&s;t vo|lume,
treating tho&s;e conquered nations with the &s;ame arbitrary contempt and
neg|lect as their conquerors had formerly done. Thus, for in&s;tance, it was
re&s;olved that Alexander's hi&s;tory &s;hould be confined to Macedonia, and
his other conque&s;ts re|ferred <PB N="311" REF="313"> to that of tho&s;e
nations he &s;ubdued; that that of the Romans, &s;hould be con|fined within the
limits of Italy, and their new lawle&s;s acqui&s;itions referred to the
hi&s;tory of the Gauls, Germans, Spaniards, Carthaginians, &amp;c. that were to
follow. This would at once have effectually cut off all needle&s;s repetitions,
with which the work hath been &s;welled beyond its de|&s;igned length, without
docking the hi&s;tory of any nation, as we have been &s;ince forced to do, to
avoid falling into the &s;ame fault in which the writers of the &s;everal Greek
hi&s;tories have fallen, where the reader may &s;ee the &s;ame facts related
over and over in the hi&s;tories of the Macedonians, Athenians, Spartans,
&amp;c. not without &s;ome vi&s;ible and unju&s;tifiable variations, all which
might ea&s;ily have been avoided, had the au|thors kept within the rules
abovementioned. But no one hath &s;hewn a greater di&s;regard to them, than the
author of the Roman hi&s;tory, who hath &s;wallowed up all the unhappy nations
that fell into tho&s;e con|querors clutches without di&s;tinction, and
expatiated with the &s;ame diffu&s;ene&s;s on their hi&s;tory without, as he
hath in that within <PB N="312" REF="314"> their territories, which though
&s;ome of our readers have approved of, as it gives a more connected hi&s;tory
of that nation, a thing &s;o much the le&s;s needful in a work of this
exten&s;ive nature, as we have it written in a body by &s;o many different
hands, yet hath been highly di&s;liked by the far greater, and I may add the
more judi|cious part of them, as contrary to our plan and engagements to the
public, and to the nature of an Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, wherein that of every
nation, &s;hould be found fully di&s;played, and every fact confined to its
pro|per &s;cene of action. It was to the neglect of attending to, or rather
keeping up to this original de&s;ign, that we mu&s;t a&s;cribe two
con&s;iderable defects in the work, again&s;t which our readers have ju&s;tly
complained. The one, that &s;ome hi&s;tories, as for in&s;tance, that of the
Carthaginians, had been fraught with an unnece&s;&s;ary repetition of all their
wars with the Romans, or which had been already fully related in the Roman
hi&s;tory, to the &s;welling of the work beyond its due limits; the other, that
to avoid that inconveniency and charge to the purcha&s;ers, tho&s;e of the
Gauls, Germans and Spaniards <PB N="313" REF="315"> are truncated, and their
wars with, and reduction by the Romans are barely referred to what hath been
&s;aid in the Roman hi&s;|tory, where they are &s;cattered and &s;o
inter|&s;per&s;ed with that of other nations, that it cannot be called a
regular and compleat hi&s;tory of them. And what is this but ab&s;orbing all
the&s;e brave nations by the lump, into that of their tyrannic conquerors; and
how could I, to who&s;e lot the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e three ancient nations
fell, avoid it by any other way, but that of recapitulating all afre&s;h, in
the mo&s;t compendious manner I could, to avoid &s;welling the work and
re|ferring the reader to the volume and page of the Roman hi&s;tory, where the
facts are mentioned at length. And there was by that time the more cau&s;e to
abridge all the&s;e needle&s;s repetitions, becau&s;e the pur|cha&s;ers, and
after them the book&s;ellers, had ju&s;tly complained, how va&s;tly the work
was already &s;welled beyond the bounds to which we had promi&s;ed to confine
it. But this was not &s;o readily complied with by the re&s;t, who having
fini&s;hed each their re&s;pective hi&s;tories, according to the plan and
me|thod agreed upon, and mentioned above, <PB N="314" REF="316"> and either did
not dream that the writer of the Roman hi&s;tory would go contrary, or when
they found he had, did re&s;ent it too much to &s;uffer their own to be
truncated on his account, in&s;i&s;ted upon their being printed at full length,
and with all their repe|titions. And this the book&s;ellers were forced to
&s;ubmit to, for fear not only of di&s;oblig|ing the authors, but likewi&s;e of
retarding the regular publication of the volumes.</P>
<P>But what will ea&s;ily convince the reader, as it hath me long
&s;ince, how much more earne&s;t the writer of the Roman hi&s;tory was to
promote his own ignoble intere&s;t, at the expence of the proprietors as well
as the credit of the work, is, that when he came afterwards to write the
&s;econd part of the hi&s;tory of the Per&s;ians, he hath re|peated at length
all their wars with the ea&s;tern emperors, together with all the other facts
and incidents that pa&s;&s;ed between them, at full length, in&s;tead of
referring to what he had formerly &s;aid in the Byzan|tine hi&s;tory; for this
plainly &s;hews that the <HI>dulcis odor lucri,</HI> more effectually
influenced him than all the complaints of the propri|etors and purcha&s;ers,
which la&s;t were be|come <PB N="315" REF="317"> &s;o rife that we thought it
nece&s;&s;ary to publi&s;h &s;omething by way of excu&s;e for this exce&s;s of
bulk, and at the &s;ame time to make the be&s;t appology we could for that and
other deviations from our original plan, without di&s;covering the cau&s;es
they were owing to, which would have rather helped to di&s;credit the work in
the eye of the world, which did not dream how little unanimity there was in our
proceedings, and how impo&s;&s;ible it was for the be&s;t in|clined of us to
keep &s;uch &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirits as were then employed, within the bounds
pre&s;cribed. I &s;hall now give a farther in|&s;tance of it, and &s;uch a
pregnant one, as will convince the reader that &s;uch a work as this could
never be carried on fairly, and according to our promi&s;e, notwith&s;tanding
all our care and precaution, even in the &s;econd impre&s;&s;ion of the work;
how much le&s;s po&s;&s;ible mu&s;t it have been, to have done &s;o in the
fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But there was &s;till a greater inconvenience re&s;ulting from
the&s;e repetitions, and the mon&s;trous bulk of the Roman hi&s;tory, and by
that time the &s;eventh volume was <PB N="316" REF="318"> fini&s;hed, the
public began to think we de|&s;igned to &s;pin the work to nine or ten, for
there were &s;till a great number of ancient kingdoms and countries to be
de&s;cribed, ac|cording to our original de&s;ign, &s;uch as the Mohammedan
hi&s;tory, and other nations interwoven with it, con&s;i&s;ting of above twenty
articles in Mr. Sale's plan, mo&s;t of them of &s;uch hard names as few readers
were acquainted with, be&s;ides the kingdoms of the great Mogul and other parts
of India, tho&s;e of Siam, China, Japan, Tartary, Ru&s;&s;ia both in Europe and
A&s;ia, the Turki&s;h empire in both, and the whole country of America; all
which could hardly be contained in le&s;s than two volumes at the lea&s;t.
However, by that time the &s;eventh volume was publi&s;hed, the pro|prietors
met with &s;o little encouragement to go on from the purcha&s;ers, and were
al|ready &s;uch con&s;iderable lo&s;ers, that they thought fit to &s;top there,
and leave the work thus maimed and imperfect; but what not only determined, but
in &s;ome mea&s;ure forced them to it, was their having the mortification
&s;oon after, to &s;ee their property invaded by three different pyratical 
<PB N="317" REF="319"> book&s;ellers of Dublin, who, as they were not at any
other charge than printing and paper, both which are much cheaper in Ireland
than here, could well enough afford it to the public for half the price that
ours &s;old for at London, and unknown to each other reprinted the work there
word for word, two of them in folio and the third in oc|tavo, and when each of
them came to un|der&s;tand that the like pyracy had been committed by the other
two, fell foul again&s;t each other in their adverti&s;ements, in &s;uch
language and opprobrious names as all three ju&s;tly de&s;erved. As therefore
&s;uch a piece of flagrant inju&s;tice could not but greatly affect the
original proprietors, who were already &s;o con&s;iderably lo&s;ers, it could
not be expected that they &s;hould run the manife&s;t hazard of throwing away
more money in pur&s;uit of their plan. We were therefore obliged to frame
an|other kind of excu&s;e for their dropping it, viz. that tho&s;e countries
and kingdoms not &s;poken of in the foregoing volumes, being of later
di&s;covery, &s;uch as India, China, &amp;c. in A&s;ia, a great part of Africa,
and the new American world, they would <PB N="318" REF="320"> be more properly
de&s;cribed, and their hi&s;to|ries begun and continued in the modern part,
which they were however no farther re&s;olved to go on with, than as they found
a probability of its meeting more encour|agement than the old had hitherto
done. So that they had now time to think on &s;ome proper means of
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing the three pyrated impre&s;&s;ions as far as po&s;&s;ible, by
expo&s;ing them to the public as they ju&s;tly de&s;erved, and propo&s;ing to
give the world a new and more correct edition of the whole in octavo, together
with additions of &s;uch material points as had been omitted in the former.</P>
<P>When this &s;econd impre&s;&s;ion came to be re&s;olved on, both
the authors and proprie|tors, &s;en&s;ible of the many mi&s;carriages of the
former, for want of our following our fir&s;t plan, did unanimou&s;ly agree
among other things, that every one of us in the revi&s;ing, correcting, and
improving each our re&s;pective parts, &s;hould oblige our&s;elves, &s;o far to
&s;tick clo&s;e to it for the future, that all the unnece&s;&s;ary repetitions
&s;hould be re&s;cinded, and every historical fact be confined to the hi&s;tory
of that country in <PB N="319" REF="321"> which it was tran&s;acted, and no
where mentioned at length but there; as the con|que&s;t of Sicily in the
hi&s;tory of that I&s;land, of Carthage in that of the Republic, of the
Spaniards, Gauls, &amp;c. in that of tho&s;e nations, which was the only way of
mak|ing every one of them compleat, and at the &s;ame time &s;horten the work,
by the avoid|ing all needle&s;s repetitions. And this we not only promi&s;ed,
but bound our&s;elves in writing to perform; however to make the point &s;till
more &s;ure, as I had rea&s;on to doubt an unanimous compliance to the
agreement from one quarter, I further pro|po&s;ed that no part &s;hould go to
the pre&s;s, till it had been examined and approved by the re&s;t. This was
accordingly oppo&s;ed by the party I &s;u&s;pected under &s;everal &s;pecious
pretences, &s;uch as taking up too much time, as we lived at &s;ome di&s;tance
from each other, the danger of mi&s;laying or lo&s;ing &s;ome of the copy, and
having now and then &s;ome alteration in controverted points, all which might
retard if not hinder the work; upon which the proprietors thought fit to give
it up, and to depend upon our honour for the exact performance of our 
<PB N="320" REF="322"> agreement. However, as he hath hardly in one &s;ingle
in&s;tance kept up to it, but hath reprinted, not only his own Roman hi&s;tory,
but &s;everal other parts done for|merly by other hands, and now com|mitted to
his care by the book&s;ellers, almo&s;t verbatim from the fir&s;t edition, to
the no &s;mall trouble of, and damage to the other authors who had filled up
the&s;e un|nece&s;&s;ary cha&s;ms in their re&s;pective parts, which he
&s;hould have &s;truck out of his own, and have been &s;ince obliged to era&s;e
all tho&s;e additions; he hath &s;ufficiently convinced every one of us what
his views were in &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ing my propo|&s;al, and
con&s;equently how impo&s;&s;ible it is for &s;uch a de&s;ign as this to be
rightly ex|ecuted, unle&s;s the whole care and revi&s;al be left to one
&s;ingle per&s;on of ability equal to it. The thing is now pa&s;t all remedy
with re&s;pect to this &s;econd edition, though it may be ea&s;ily rectified in
every re|&s;pect in a future one, if any &s;uch may ever find encouragement.
But the wrong done to the public in this &s;econd, is the more con&s;iderable,
through the unfairne&s;s of the author above mentioned, in as much as, 
<PB N="321" REF="323"> though he is the only one concerned, that hath not
complied with our articles, he has by his &s;ubdulous artifice had the far
greater &s;hare in the work committed to him. And I think I have the greater
right to complain of his breach of promi&s;e, and the di&s;credit he hath
brought on us and the work, as I can make it appear that neither in the fir&s;t
nor &s;econd edition, I have ever departed from our original plan, in any of
tho&s;e parts I have been engaged in, nor in&s;erted any thing in them except
by way of promi&s;&s;um or reference, that properly belonged to an|other. And
for the truth of this I &s;hall only appeal to the&s;e parts, a li&s;t of which
I &s;hall, in ju&s;tice to my own character, now give to the reader.

<P>In the &s;econd edition, wherein we endea|voured to &s;upply all
the material omi&s;&s;ions in the fir&s;t, the following parts came to my
&s;hare, viz. 
<LIST>

</LIST></P>
<P>I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve with re&s;pect to the la&s;t of the&s;e,
that it had been promi&s;ed in our plan from the very beginning, but had been
deferred, as more properly belonging to the modern hi&s;tory; upon which
&s;everal of our &s;ub&s;cribers and corre&s;pondents complained of the
omi&s;&s;ion, as it is a &s;ubject not only curious and in&s;tructive, but
likewi&s;e little known, and therefore much wanted; upon which we had agreed to
&s;atisfy their de|mand, and to have in&s;erted it at the end of the &s;econd
part of the Jewi&s;h or the Roman hi&s;tory, and I had accordingly pre|pared it
for the pre&s;s again&s;t that time, and <PB N="323" REF="325"> be&s;towed full
&s;ix months in the writing of it, be&s;ides what I had &s;pent before in
col|lecting &s;uch curious materials as fell in my way; &s;o that the copy,
which will make about fifteen or &s;ixteen &s;heets of the octavo edition, hath
been a good while in the hands of the proprietors, and as I had rea&s;on to
expect, would have been printed before now in the fifteenth or &s;ixteenth
volume, of which I had appri&s;ed &s;everal of my corre&s;pondents, as well as
tho&s;e of my acquaintance who enquired after it. But to my &s;urpri&s;e, the
proprietors have &s;ince de|termined to po&s;tpone it till the Modern Hi&s;tory
comes out, as it brings the hi&s;tory of the Jewi&s;h nation down to the
pre&s;ent time, which no other in the work doth, and can have no place in the
Antient. But the real cau&s;e was the want of room, the work being like to
&s;well beyond the number of volumes promi&s;ed in their propo&s;als.</P>
<P>The truth is they being in &s;ome mea&s;ure obliged to include it
within the compa&s;s of twenty, or at mo&s;t twenty-one volumes, in order to
&s;uppre&s;s the pyratical Iri&s;h edi|tion (which was promi&s;ed to be
contained <PB N="324" REF="326"> within that number, though without any
probability (or perhaps de&s;ign) of their &s;o doing, if one may gue&s;s by
the bulk of each of tho&s;e volumes that have been publi&s;hed) there was a
nece&s;&s;ity of reducing matters within a narrower com|pa&s;s. And this upon a
&s;trict computation might have been ea&s;ily done, notwith&s;tand|ing the
&s;everal additions that were to be made to the work, had all the needle&s;s
repetitions been re&s;cinded, the &s;tyle made more conci&s;e, and a great
number of &s;uper|fluous facts, circum&s;tances, di&s;qui&s;itions, and
controver&s;ies, mo&s;t of them u&s;ele&s;s and incompatible with the nature of
&s;o ex|ten&s;ive a work, been &s;truck out of both the text and notes, as we
had agreed &s;hould be done by every one in his re&s;pective parts, and hath
been actually done by all but one, and him the per&s;on who had the large&s;t
&s;hare in the revi&s;ing and contracting of the work; &s;o that through his
neglect and noncompliance, the work hath &s;welled not only much beyond our
computation, but would have done much more &s;o, had not the proprietors from a
laudable de&s;ire of keeping up as much as could po&s;&s;ibly 
<PB N="325" REF="327"> be done to the fir&s;t propo&s;als, not only
generou&s;ly thrown in five or &s;ix &s;heets ex|traordinary into every volume,
but likewi&s;e enlarged every page both in the length and number of the lines,
by which each volume from the fourth downwards, may be ju&s;tly &s;aid to
contain between &s;ix or &s;even &s;heets more of matter than was origi|nally
propo&s;ed, or than the third or fourth contained. And this I am bound to
men|tion in ju&s;tice to them, becau&s;e though they were con&s;iderable
lo&s;ers by the fir&s;t edition, they yet cho&s;e to put them&s;elves to this
extraordinary expence, rather than in|cur the charge of impo&s;ing upon the
public, by the unexpected addition of three or four volumes more than they had
engaged to compri&s;e the whole work in. However, I cannot but be &s;orry that
the&s;e con&s;iderations &s;hould be looked upon as a &s;ufficinet pretext for
their &s;uppre&s;&s;ing that &s;equel of the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory I have been
&s;peaking of, contrary to the original plan of the work, and the expectation
of &s;o many of its en|couragers. And I do purpo&s;ely take notice of it, that
in ca&s;e I can not prevail upon them to print it at the end of the work, 
<PB N="326" REF="328"> and leave it at the option of &s;ub&s;cribers, either to
buy or leave it, the public may know where the fault lies, and that my friends
may not lay it at my door.</P>
<P>Thus much may &s;uffice for the hi&s;tory of this work, and to
account for the great imperfections of the fir&s;t edition, and for the
&s;econd not turning out better than it hath; and I doubt not, when the reader
con&s;iders all the&s;e things he will be apt rather to wonder, as I have often
done, that it is come out &s;o well as it is. I have no intention, much le&s;s
any cau&s;e to reflect on the proprietors of the work, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who
are become &s;o &s;ince the deaths or failure of mo&s;t of the old ones. They
have &s;pared neither pains nor co&s;t towards its improve|ment, nor been
wanting in genero&s;ity to the authors. They never once di&s;puted with me
about the price I &s;et upon my la|bour, nor refu&s;ed to &s;upply me with
&s;uch &s;ums as I drew upon them for. This is indeed more than I can or ought
to &s;ay of the old &s;et of them, &s;ome of whom often put us to great
difficulties by their &s;ordidne&s;s and mutual jealou&s;ies and
mi&s;under&s;tandings, all which I with plea&s;ure ob&s;erved to vani&s;h 
<PB N="327" REF="329"> upon the coming in of this new &s;et. It is true that as
far as related to me, they always found me diligent and punctual; I performed
the parts I undertook to the be&s;t of my abi|lity, and being content with a
moderate gain, could be&s;tow the more time and labour upon them, and always
took care to have them fini&s;hed at the time required; and &s;o wholly, and I
may add cordially, was I in|tent upon the work in general, that I would never
engage in any other whil&s;t that la&s;ted. And this they were &s;o far
&s;atisfied of, and &s;o entirely relied on me, that whether in town or
country, I have been allowed to drawn upon Mr. Millar, for &s;ome &s;cores of
pounds before hand, which were punctu|ally an&s;wered by him, though neither he
nor any of the partners, ever &s;aw any of my copy till it went to the pre&s;s;
and when printed off paid the &s;urplus with uncom|mon genero&s;ity, for I
always took care to keep within compa&s;s. This may look like vanity for me to
&s;ay of my&s;elf, but as it will not be made public till after my death, when
I &s;hall be out of the way of reaping any &s;atifaction from it, but the
con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of having acted an hone&s;t part; and 
<PB N="328" REF="330"> as this hath been my con&s;tant method with all the
book&s;ellers with whom I have been concerned, and for this I dare appeal to
all who have employed me, I am the le&s;s &s;cru|pulous about any &s;ini&s;ter
con&s;truction a cen&s;orious reader may put upon it; tho&s;e who have known me
and my conver&s;ation for much above the&s;e twenty years, will I hope pa&s;s a
more candid judgment upon it.</P>
<P>However, with re&s;pect to the management of the partners about
this &s;econd edition, I cannot but ob&s;erve that they were guilty of two
fatal errors. The fir&s;t in com|mitting &s;o great a &s;hare of the work, as
well as the revi&s;al of the whole to a man, who they had all rea&s;on to
believe aimed chiefly at gain and di&s;patch, and to agree with him by the lump
as they did, which would only prove a temptation to him to hurry it off as
fa&s;t as he could, and as he accordingly did, to their no &s;mall
mortifica|tion, as well as hurt to them&s;elves and the work. I might add, that
as he was and owned him&s;elf quite unacquainted with the ea&s;tern languages,
he was the mo&s;t unqualified for &s;everal parts that fell to 
<PB N="329" REF="331"> his lot of any and if care had not been taken would have
committed &s;uch mi&s;takes in the very &s;pelling of pro|per names, as would
quite have di&s;|credited it.</P>
<P>The other was their engaging to publi&s;h a volume monthly, and
beginning to pub|li&s;h before they had a &s;ufficient number ready printed
before hand, to have enabled them to keep up to their time; the want of which
precaution hath &s;ince obliged them to have &s;everal volumes on the anvill at
different pre&s;&s;es at once, and to be di&s;|patched with &s;uch
precipitation that the compo&s;itors have overlooked many litteral errors which
had been corrected by the authors, and which is &s;till wor&s;e, this hath
likewi&s;e made it impo&s;&s;ible for us to make the proper and nece&s;&s;ary
references from one volume to the other as they were printed at the &s;ame
time, and not regularly one after another, as they &s;hould have done, &s;o
that in &s;ome ca&s;es we could hardly refer to the volume much le&s;s to the
page; but the reader will find many in&s;tances of this la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="332">I &s;hall now give &s;ome few u&s;eful hints
how this work may be made compleat in a future edition by one &s;ingle hand, if
equal to the ta&s;k; fir&s;t, let whoever under|takes it read it all over again
attentively and regularly, one volume after another, and as he reads,
common-place every thing, per&s;on, fact, &amp;c. as if he de&s;igned it for a
compleat and copious index. Let him not depend upon that general one which is
ready made to his hand, at the end of the work, and where all the&s;e
needle&s;s repeti|tions, incon&s;i&s;tences, and contradictions may be artfully
omitted or concealed, but either make a full and exact one <HI>de novo,</HI> or
at lea&s;t con&s;ult the printed one upon every point he reads over, and mark
down every &s;uch omi&s;&s;ion or concealment; though were it my ca&s;e I
&s;hould rather prefer the former, becau&s;e there will be the le&s;s labour
lo&s;t, as it will &s;tand ready for &s;uch when the work comes to be
reprinted, and he will have afterwards nothing to do but add the printed pages
to every article as they come in cour&s;e, only if it &s;hould be deemed too
full, he may &s;trike out afterwards &s;uch as ap|pear of le&s;s moment. But he
will find <PB N="331" REF="333"> this &s;ingular benefit by &s;uch an exact
com|mon-placing of every thing, that it will di&s;cover to him at once every
needle&s;s re|petition, every incon&s;i&s;tency and contra|diction as he reads
on, which he may at the &s;ame time mark down in the margin of the book, in
order to correct them on the &s;econd reading. He may then &s;et down
likewi&s;e in the margin, the volume and page where the &s;ame thing is told
be|fore, where it is differently related or &s;et in a different light, and in
ca&s;es that admit a di&s;pute, by con&s;ulting the original au|thors, be able
to judge which is right or mo&s;t probable. Thus for in&s;tance, when he finds
the very &s;ame facts related in the hi&s;tories of Sicily, Rome and Carthage,
he will ea&s;ily know where they ought to have been &s;et down at length,
namely, where the &s;cene of action happened, and where only to be referred to
it, viz. in the other two. So that whatever either the Romans or Carthaginians
tran&s;acted in Sicily, &s;hould be only promi&s;ed or referred to in their
hi&s;tory, and only related at full length in that of the Sicilians; and &s;o
of the re&s;t. He will likewi&s;e by &s;uch an index find <PB N="332" REF="334"> out where any facts or tran&s;actions have been differently related
or repre&s;ented by each of their writers, who mu&s;t of cour&s;e be
&s;uppo&s;ed, and will upon trial be found to cla&s;h often, for want of
frequently con|ferring with each other, or duly con&s;ult|ing and examining, or
perhaps &s;ome times of rightly under&s;tanding the original authors they
pretend to follow.</P>
<P>By this means he will likewi&s;e be able to di&s;cover many facts
related in one place, which more properly belong to, or might be more
conveniently transferred to an|other, and place them &s;o accordingly in his
marginal notes. By that time he hath common-placed the whole &s;et of volumes,
he will be likewi&s;e able to di&s;cover every material omi&s;&s;ion under
every article, either from his own memory and reading, or by turning to the
index of &s;uch books as treat of the &s;ame &s;ubject, and be able to &s;upply
every &s;uch defect from them. Thus in the articles of nations, as Jews,
Egyptians, Romans, &amp;c. or of cities, as Jeru&s;alem, Alexandria, Rome,
&amp;c. if he finds any thing material, which not being in his common-place
book, makes him conclude <PB N="333" REF="335"> it was omitted in the work, he
will like|wi&s;e ea&s;ily &s;upply from tho&s;e authors and their indexes, and
the &s;ame may be done by the articles of names of kingdoms, provinces,
monarchs, &amp;c. by furni&s;hing him&s;elf with the be&s;t modern authors who
have wrote of them, and &s;upplying each with every thing he finds wanting in
his own common-place book, as well as ex|change &s;ome le&s;s material trifles
that are in this, for more momentous ones he will find in them, all which may
be done with little trouble, and he will &s;till re&s;erve to him&s;elf the
liberty of the difference in con|troverted points he will meet with among
tho&s;e moderns, by having recou&s;e to the original ones; for he mu&s;t make
it a &s;tand|ing rule to him&s;elf, not to rely on the for|mer which are more
copious than exact, without con&s;ulting the latter, and where tho&s;e differ
among them&s;elves as they often do, to u&s;e all proper helps either to
recon|cile them, or to chu&s;e the more probable &s;ide.</P>
<P>This would have been the method I &s;hould have taken, had I had
any &s;hare in the revi&s;ing any other but my own particu|lar 
<PB N="334" REF="336"> parts in the work; tho' I mu&s;t &s;till have thought it
too much for any one to have revi&s;ed the whole, and &s;hould have thought it
nece&s;&s;ary to have imparted the above mentioned rules to the re&s;t, in
order to have enabled them to have rectified every mi&s;take, contra&s;t, and
jarring, between their parts. For as I knew that all the hopes of the
proprietors, was in a &s;econd, and more correct edition, to reimbur&s;e the
lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained by the fir&s;t; I had their con|&s;ent to
compo&s;e the index to each of the volumes, (the fir&s;t excepted, which was
done by the &s;ame hand that wrote the Roman hi&s;tory, and ju&s;tly condemned
for its unnece&s;&s;ary length and verbo&s;ity) by which I could ob&s;erve as I
read along, and marked in the margin of the leaves, every needle&s;s
repetition, &s;uperfluity, contrariety, omi&s;&s;ion, tran&s;po&s;ition,
&amp;c. that would be nece&s;&s;ary to make the next impre&s;&s;ion more
compleat, e&s;pecially when I came to make the general one to the whole; and
was the better inabled by it, to re&s;cind and alter what I found ami&s;s or
&s;uperfluous in tho&s;e parts that came more immediately under my care, though
I have had &s;ince <PB N="335" REF="337"> rea&s;on to think I have gone too far
in it, and out of complai&s;ance to the proprietors, who complained that my
Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory was too diffu&s;e for a work of this nature, have been
prevailed on to &s;trike out in this &s;econd edition many curious things,
which I have &s;ince found had been very well liked and approved of in the
fir&s;t. But without &s;uch re&s;ci&s;ions it was impo&s;|ble to bring the
whole within the com|pa&s;s propo&s;ed, e&s;pecially as they were &s;o much
neglected in &s;everal other parts of the work, which would at lea&s;t as
conve|niently admit of them, &s;uch as the Dyna|&s;tes of the Egyptians, the
hi&s;tory of Per&s;ia from the oriental writers, and many other &s;uch fabulous
ab&s;urdities. However, I can|not accu&s;e my&s;elf of having &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
any thing that was of moment in that hi&s;tory; though &s;everal perhaps, and
to my no &s;mall regret, which would have been acceptable to the curious in
that kind of learning. As for all the other parts within my province, I have
rather enlarged and improved them with new proofs, ob&s;ervations and curious
additions, as may be ea&s;ily found by com|paring the two editions
together.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="338">With relation to the de&s;iderata in both
editions, I cannot forbear taking notice that the ancient hi&s;tory of the
northern nations, &s;uch as Mo&s;covy, Poland, Sweden, Den|mark, Norway,
&amp;c. hath been altogether omitted except &s;ome few hints that have been
given in that of the Scythians and Celtes, intimating only that the former were
originally de&s;cended from the latter. It is indeed commonly believed that
the&s;e remote nations have no records of their ancient times, but I had a
&s;ingular oppor|tunity of being convinced of the contrary, by a learned
gentleman who was a pro|fe&s;&s;or of hi&s;tory, &amp;c. in the univer&s;ity of
Abbo in Norway, but came to London mo&s;tly every &s;ummer as an agent from the
king of Sweden, and among other new books, u&s;ed to buy &s;everal &s;etts of
the Uni|ver&s;al Hi&s;tory for that Prince, for count Coning&s;egg, and other
great per&s;ons in that kingdom. This gentleman having ex|pre&s;&s;ed a
de&s;ire to Mr. Symons his book|&s;eller, and one of the proprietors, of
con|ver&s;ing with one of the authors, particu|larly with that of the Jewi&s;h
hi&s;tory, we &s;oon came acquainted together, and upon <PB N="337" REF="339">
my enquiring of him after &s;uch records or monuments of tho&s;e northern
nations on which one might compile their ancient hi&s;|tory, gave me &s;uch a
&s;atisfactory account, as made me per&s;uade Mr. Symon, and the other
partners, to engage him to undertake it, which he, with &s;ome difficulty,
agreed to do, notwith&s;tanding his other avocations. I had the plea&s;ure of
&s;eeing him every time he came to London, and to hear how well he proceeded in
the work; and accordingly in about three years he brought a large and elaborate
account of all the northern nations and countries, their origin, ancient
&s;ettlements, hi&s;tory, &amp;c. with many curious ob&s;ervations on their
geogra|phy, natural hi&s;tory, and the whole backed with &s;uch good
authorities and proofs, as one would hardly have expected from &s;uch barren
climes, and was recommended by &s;everal of the mo&s;t learned men in Swe|den
and Norway, who had the peru&s;al, or even contributed to &s;ome part or other
of it.</P>
<P>This chapter, which, according to our ori|ginal plan, was to have
preceded the ir|ruption of the Huns, Goths, Vandals, Suevi 
<PB N="338" REF="340"> and into the &s;outhern parts of Europe, would have
given a much better and clearer account of the&s;e barbarous nations, than that
which hath been given in the hi&s;tory of their new &s;ettlements in Hungary,
Italy, France, Spain, &amp;c. The misfortune was, that it proved too bulky
(though no|thing could be &s;aid to be &s;uperfluous or impertinent in it) it
being computed to amount to above &s;eventy folio &s;heets, for which they
could not find room, our work being already &s;wolen va&s;tly beyond its bulk;
&s;o that Dr. Sidenius, that was the learned author's name, had the
mortification of having that curious part refu&s;ed by the proprietors, and
returned upon his hands, the old ones, as Me&s;s. Symon and Batley, being dead,
and the re&s;t, except Mr. O&s;|borne in Grays-Inn, being gone off, and the new
ones not looking upon them&s;elves concerned in the agreement. And this I
mention with no &s;mall regret, becau&s;e it was a con&s;iderable lo&s;s to the
learned world, as well as to the author, and &s;uch as I much fear will hardly
be ever recovered.</P>
<P>In the interval between the conclu&s;ion of the fir&s;t, and the
re&s;olution of printing the <PB N="339" REF="341"> &s;econd, I was invited
into a &s;hare of the new Sy&s;tem of Geography, in which though the Public
found ju&s;t fault with the extra|vagant length of that which related to Great
Britain and Ireland, I yet found the authors concerned in it, &s;o well
qualified for the work, &s;o communicative and punc|tual in their regular
meetings once a fort|night, that I readily came into it, and found with
plea&s;ure the work carried on with more unanimity, exactne&s;s, and to the
&s;ati&s;|faction of the proprietors, as well as of the public. The parts I did
in that work were tho&s;e that follow. 1. Spain, Portugal and the i&s;lands
belonging to them. 2. Italy, Savoy, Piedmont, and the i&s;lands of Sicily,
Sardinia, Cor&s;ica, &amp;c. 3. Mu&s;covy both in Europe and A&s;ia. 4. Turky
in A&s;ia. 5. In A&s;ia, China, Japan, Jetzo, and the i&s;lands along tho&s;e
coa&s;ts, particularly that of Formo&s;a, which part I cho&s;e, that I might
take occa&s;ion publickly to acknow|ledge, as it were by a third hand, the
fal&s;|hood and impo&s;ture of my former account of that i&s;land. 6. In
Africa, the king|doms of Egypt, Aby&s;&s;inia, Lybia, Barbary, Tripoli, Tunis,
Morocco, Fez, with an <PB N="340" REF="342"> account of the Mediterranean Sea,
and the famed river of Sanaga. 7. The Azores i&s;lands. 8. In America, the
countries of Bra&s;il, Magellan, Terra del Fuego, Canada, Loui&s;iana, and the
Bahamas and Bermudas i&s;lands. And by the time I had concluded the&s;e la&s;t,
I was called upon to prepare my re&s;pective parts of the Univer&s;al
Hi&s;tory, for the &s;econd impre&s;&s;ion mentioned above. I have however
found &s;ufficient rea&s;on to complain of the wrong management of this work in
&s;everal re&s;pects, though other|wi&s;e carried on with greater exactne&s;s
and unanimity than that of the Univer&s;al Hi&s;|tory, and I &s;hall now take
the liberty of mentioning &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable ones, becau&s;e
they have been the cau&s;e of &s;ome unavoidable errors and blunders, not only
in the two above mentioned works, but in mo&s;t others that have been
publi&s;hed in the &s;ame or near the &s;ame way. The fir&s;t is the authors
being tied to produce &s;uch a number of &s;heets in &s;o &s;hort a time as is
almo&s;t incompatible with their de&s;ire, if any &s;uch they have, of
performing their re&s;pective parts with any exactne&s;s; for, though the
publi&s;hers &s;eldom fail of ac|quainting <PB N="341" REF="343"> the public
that the work is either already, or pretty near fini&s;hed and ready for the
pre&s;s, &s;o that there is no danger of its meeting with any delay or
impediment, yet that is &s;eldom if ever the ca&s;e, and with re&s;pect to the
works I am &s;peaking of, I found it quite the rever&s;e, and that they have
frequently been &s;ent to the pre&s;s, under the promi&s;e of being regularly
pub|li&s;hed, by &s;uch a number of &s;heets every week or month, when
&s;carcely a fourth part of it was written. So that, to prevent the retard|ing
of the work, they have been obliged to call in for new helps, whom they have
obliged to engage to perform their part in le&s;s than half the time, that it
would have rea&s;onably required; con&s;idering that they not only had it all
to begin and go through in that &s;hort &s;pace, as was the ca&s;e in this new
Sy&s;tem of Geography, but that &s;ome of them were likewi&s;e engaged in
&s;ome other work, between which and this, they were forced to divide their
time and diligence, though either of them did more than re|quire it all; and
how could it be po&s;&s;ible for either to be performed as it ought?</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="344">Another mi&s;management from the be|ginning
was, the interlarding every fourth or fifth number with a &s;et of maps which
indeed gave &s;ome breathing time to the authors, but then it confined them to
re|ceive all their directions concerning the limits, &s;ituation, longitude,
latitude, di&s;|tances, &amp;c. from tho&s;e maps, which being &s;uch as the
engraver rather than the au|thors had made choice of, as the mo&s;t au|thentic
in his opinion, were not always &s;o judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en as could have been
wi&s;hed. This made many errors remedi|le&s;s and irretrievable, becau&s;e the
greate&s;t part of tho&s;e maps had been publi&s;hed in &s;uch numbers,
&s;everal months before the authors were called upon to begin the geography of
tho&s;e countries. This I often complained of to the proprietors from the
beginning, both as a great over|&s;ight and a hard&s;hip upon the authors, who,
in&s;tead of being allowed to direct the en|graver in the choice or compiling
of them, were obliged to follow him implicitly, and often contrary to their own
opinion and liking, in tho&s;e which he had thought fit to pitch upon for our
guide. Thus in the <PB N="343" REF="345"> map of Japan, for in&s;tance, the
land of Jetzo is affirmed to be the &s;ame with Cum|&s;chatta, though contrary
to fact, it not being &s;o much as part of it. I might add likewi&s;e, that
tho&s;e maps confined us to the orthography of places, though very often
erroneous, or being of foreign extract, con|veyed a wrong &s;ound of the name
to an Engli&s;h ear.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t con&s;iderable mi&s;management was in the choice of
&s;uch printers as bore indeed the greate&s;t &s;way and intere&s;t, and who
con&s;equently had &s;uch a glut of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, that every thing was
di&s;patched with the utmo&s;t hurry and precipitation, in order to keep up to
their time. This never failed cau&s;ing a great deal of confu&s;ion and
in|correctne&s;s in the printing, particularly in the othography of proper
names, and giv|ing the authors a great deal of trouble in correcting the
proofs, which, however, was but too often of no &s;ervice, through the hurry
the compo&s;itors were in, which made them overlook and often neglect tho&s;e
cor|rections. It frequently happened likewi&s;e, that they required &s;uch a
quick di&s;patch of the author, in correcting the &s;heets, that 
<PB N="344" REF="346"> they had not time enough to read them over with that
carefulne&s;s they would otherwi&s;e have done; &s;o that they them|&s;elves
could not avoid overlooking even &s;ome material errors in the &s;pelling, but
mo&s;t chiefly in the numbers and figures. As for me, it being my con&s;tant
rule not to be engaged in two works at once, I never would let a proof go out
of my hands, without a &s;econd, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, a third reading, but I
have often found that I might as well have &s;aved my&s;elf that labour,
&s;ince the correctors or compo&s;itors had not time enough left to make the
pro|per emendations, and &s;ometimes have &s;ent the &s;heet to the pre&s;s
before the proof hath been returned.</P>
<P>To prevent this unfair dealing, as I may ju&s;tly call it, or at
lea&s;t to lay the blame at the right door, I had taken a method of
in&s;i&s;ting upon having two proofs, of each &s;heet, &s;ent me from the
pre&s;s; under pre|tence of keeping one of them by me, to refer to when it was
requi&s;ite, but in fact by correcting both proofs alike in the mar|gin, to be
able to produce that which I kept by me, again&s;t both the compo&s;itor, 
<PB N="345" REF="347"> and corrector, when ever they were guilty of any &s;uch
neglect. But as &s;oon as my de&s;ign was found out by them, &s;ome
plau|&s;ible excu&s;es were made, for not continu|ing to &s;end duplicates, and
I was forced to give up that point, unle&s;s I had a mind to di&s;oblige the
very ma&s;ter printers, who were &s;ome of the riche&s;t, and bore the
greate&s;t &s;way with the proprietors, and had already deprived us, under the
pretence of di&s;patch, of the privelege of revi&s;ing our copy, after our
fir&s;t correction. This la&s;t indeed was denied us, on account of the
unrea&s;onable trouble, which one of the authors too frequently gave them, in
tho&s;e revi&s;es at the fir&s;t &s;etting out? who did often require three or
four of them, and every one loaded with new, and mo&s;tly needle&s;s
alterations, which took up &s;o much of the compo&s;itors time that they were
obliged to complain of it. This was, though true with re&s;pect to one author,
but a poor pretence for depriving the re&s;t of the liberty of one &s;ingle
revi&s;e, which they chiefly in&s;i&s;ted on, not &s;o much to make any
nece&s;&s;ary alterations, as only to be &s;atisfied that none of their
corrections were <PB N="346" REF="348"> overlooked. However, the point was
over|ruled by the printers; and that material check being taken off from the
compo&s;itors, the literal errors multiplied &s;o fa&s;t upon us, e&s;pecially
in the words and quotations out of the ea&s;tern languages, that we were
obliged to take notice only of &s;uch as were of the greate&s;t moment in the
table of errata of the fir&s;t edition, and to curtail as many of tho&s;e
foreign words as we could in the &s;econd, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Arabic,
Hebrew, and Syriac kind.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the principal cau&s;es of that
incorrectne&s;s which commonly, I had almo&s;t &s;aid unavoidably, happen in
the&s;e kinds of works, let an author be ever &s;o de&s;irous and careful to
avoid them, unle&s;s he hath &s;o great a &s;way over the printers, that they
dare not refu&s;e him the liberty of revi&s;ing his own work as often as he
&s;ees it needful. And the lea&s;t that he can in&s;i&s;t on, for his own
credit and &s;atisfaction, is a revi&s;al of every proof after it hath been
corrected by him.</P>
<P>I did take occa&s;ion to mention a little higher the wrong
information which Mr. Palmer gave me concerning Bi&s;hop Hare's Metrical 
<PB N="347" REF="349"> P&s;alter, which was, unknown to me, put into Mr.
Bowyer's hands to print, whil&s;t I was writing the fir&s;t part of the
Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory, and as there had elap&s;ed &s;everal years be|tween the
time, in which Mr. Palmer was applied to by Dr. Wa&s;hburn, and that of my
becoming in cour&s;e to write on the &s;ub|ject of the Hebrew poetry, which had
confirmed me in the opinion that the bi&s;hop's de&s;ign was quite &s;et
a&s;ide; I made no difficulty to affirm after the generality of the learned
writers on that &s;ubject, that the metre of the Hebrew P&s;alms and other
poetical pieces in the Old Te&s;tament, was looked upon as irretrievably
lo&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the efforts of &s;ome, and the pretences of others,
who vainly imagined they had or were in the way of recovering it. I backed my
opinion with &s;ome new arguments which had occurred to me during my
fruit|le&s;s &s;earch after it, and which appeared to me to carry no &s;mall
force. This part, which was contained in the ninth number of the fir&s;t
volume, was &s;carcely publi&s;hed, before the bi&s;hop's P&s;alter came out.
It may be ea&s;ily imagined that my curio&s;ity would not permit me to be long
without <PB N="348" REF="350"> examining that performance, which &s;eemed to
overthrow all that I had &s;aid on that &s;ub|ject, and &s;adly was I vexed
that my part was publi&s;hed before I had &s;een this un|expected piece. Had I
dreamed of any &s;uch being &s;o near coming out, I would doubtle&s;s have
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed mine till I had thereby examined it. What &s;urpri&s;ed me
mo&s;t, and made me entertain &s;ome higher notion of that enterprize, was the
long inter|val which had pa&s;&s;ed between the time of its being fini&s;hed
and offered to Mr. Pal|mer, and that of its being publi&s;hed, which I reckon
to have been about &s;ix or &s;even years, and which I therefore &s;uppo&s;ed
the bi&s;hop and his learned friend Dr. W&mdash;, had &s;pent in the revi&s;ing
and poli&s;hing it; but, upon &s;tricter enquiry, I found the cau&s;e of that
delay to have been of a different nature, and was as follows.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip had excepted again&s;t Mr. Pal|mer's Hebrew types,
which were of Athias's font, and a little battered, and in|&s;i&s;ted upon his
having a new &s;ett from Mr. Ca&s;lon, which greatly exceeded it in beauty. But
Mr. Palmer was &s;o deep in debt to him, that he knew not well how to 
<PB N="349" REF="351"> procure it from him without ready money, which he was
not able to &s;pare. The bi&s;hop likewi&s;e in&s;i&s;ted upon having &s;ome
Roman and Italic types ca&s;t with &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hing mark, to direct
his readers to the Hebrew letters they were de&s;igned to an&s;wer, and the&s;e
required a new &s;ett of punches and matrices before they could be ca&s;t, and
that would have delayed the work, which Mr. Palmer was in ha&s;te to go about,
that he might the &s;ooner finger &s;ome of his lord&s;hip's money. This put
him upon &s;uch an unfair &s;tratagem, which when di&s;covered, quite
di&s;gu&s;ted his lord&s;hip again&s;t him, viz. repre&s;enting Mr. Ca&s;lon as
an idle, dilatory work|man, who would in all probability make them wait
&s;everal years for tho&s;e few types, if ever he fini&s;hed them. That he was
in|deed the only arti&s;t that could &s;upply him with tho&s;e types, but that
he hated work, and was not to be depended upon, and therefore advi&s;ed his
lord&s;hip to make &s;hift with &s;ome &s;ort which he could &s;ub&s;ti|tute;
and would an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e, rather than run the ri&s;k of
&s;taying &s;o long, and being perhaps di&s;appointed. The 
<PB N="350" REF="352"> bi&s;hop, however, being re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to
have the de&s;ired types, &s;ent for Mr. Bowyer, and a&s;ked him whether he
knew a letter founder that could ca&s;t him &s;uch a &s;ett out of hand, who
immediately recom|mended Mr. Ca&s;lon; and, being told what a &s;ad and
di&s;advantageous character he had heard of him, Mr. Bowyer not only
a&s;&s;ured his lord&s;hip that it was a very fal&s;e and un|ju&s;t one, and
engaged to get the above-mentioned types ca&s;t by him, and a new font of his
Hebrew ones, in as &s;hort a time as the thing could po&s;&s;ibly be done. Mr.
Ca&s;lon was accordingly &s;ent for by his lord&s;hip, and having made him
&s;en&s;ible of the time the new ones would require to be made ready for u&s;e,
did pro|duce them according to his promi&s;e, and the book was &s;oon after put
to the pre&s;s; and this it was that had &s;o long retarded its
publication.</P>
<P>I was not long without it, and mu&s;t own that his preface, in
which his lord&s;hip con|futed, with uncommon learning and keene&s;s, all the
&s;y&s;tems that hitherto appeared in public, rai&s;ed my expectation to a high
de|gree. For if the metre of the &s;acred book <PB N="351" REF="353"> could but
be &s;uppo&s;ed to come up to the loftine&s;s and dignity of the thoughts and
expre&s;&s;ions, (and who could ever have doubted of it, that con&s;iders how
much greater genius the latter requires than the former?) it mu&s;t I thought
have greatly ex|celled that of Homer and Virgil. But how great was my
&s;urpri&s;e, when upon reading on I found that his lord&s;hip had reduced it
to a poor low, crawling humdrum, bitony of trochaics and iambics, or <HI>vice
ver&s;a</HI> as the reader plea&s;ed, and into which he might with ea&s;e, and
with much le&s;s than half the variations, maiming and di&s;|tortion of the
text, have reduced any com|mon pro&s;e out of any language! How much more
&s;till to find in almo&s;t every line, words, and &s;ometimes whole ver&s;es
mutilated, &s;tretched out or lopped off, tran&s;po&s;ed or exchanged <HI>ad
libitum,</HI> in order to bring them to his ill contrived &s;tandard! To hear a
learned prelate, with all the &s;eeming gravity imaginable, affirm that the
Hebrew poetry, (which by the way was arrived to &s;uch prodigious heights, with
re&s;pect to the grandeur and loftine&s;s of its figures and imagery, even &s;o
early as <PB N="352" REF="354"> Mo&s;e's time) was even &s;o low as in David's
time, &s;o crude, imperfect and vague, as not to have &s;o much as a
determinate dif|ference between long and &s;hort &s;yllables, e&s;pecially
con&s;idering to what a heighth of perfection that monarch had improved the art
of mu&s;ic; and, what is &s;till more &s;ur|pri&s;ing than all the re&s;t, to
&s;ee his lord&s;hip, in con&s;equence of this his low conceit of the Hebrew
poetry, take &s;uch pains to marr, deface, and de&s;troy &s;ome of the mo&s;t
&s;ur|pri&s;ing, lofty and complicated figures and allu&s;ions in that &s;acred
book, and &s;uch as far excel all that is to be met with in the Greek and Latin
poets. But for the&s;e I mu&s;t refer the reader to what I have ob|&s;erved of
the Hebrew poetry, and on that ab&s;urd performance, in the Univer&s;al
Hi&s;tory (&s;ee vol. iv. of folio edition p. 710 <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> and
notes, and in the octavo one, vol. x. p. 202 <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> and note
(E). The occa&s;ion of my being obliged to make tho&s;e animadver&s;ions on it,
was as follows.</P>
<P>I was &s;o &s;hocked at the freedom which that prelate took to
depreciate, muti|late and vilify &s;o &s;ublime a &s;et of the noble&s;t and
mo&s;t divine poems, that I <PB N="353" REF="355"> thought my&s;elf obliged to
write again&s;t him, and to expo&s;e, as they de&s;erved, all his unfair
critici&s;ms on it, all his forced emendations, and, above all, the ab&s;urdity
of his new-di&s;covered metre; but withal, in &s;uch a re&s;pectful manner, as
was due to a per&s;on of his character. And in order to that, retired for three
months into Surry and Hamp&s;hire, where I had an op|portunity to con&s;ult,
upon proper occa&s;ions, &s;ome of my friends, who were no &s;tran|gers to that
kind of learning. I found the ta&s;k the le&s;s difficult, as I pre&s;ently
fell in among &s;ome of them, who not only condemned his performance, but had
rai&s;ed already &s;ome very material objections again&s;t it, which they
readily communi|cated to me as &s;oon as they were appri&s;ed of my de&s;ign.
One of them among the re&s;t had (by way of expo&s;ing his lord|&s;hip's
contemptible metre) reduced the Engli&s;h Lord's Prayer, Creed, Ten
Com|mandments, and the <HI>Te Deum,</HI> into the &s;ame crawling mea&s;ure;
whil&s;t I, who wholly confined my&s;elf to the Hebrew, had already done the
&s;ame by the fir&s;t chapter of Gene&s;is, and the la&s;t chapter of 
<PB N="354" REF="356"> Malachi, both which I had likewi&s;e turned into the
&s;ame dull ver&s;e, without half the deviations from the text, which his
lord&s;hip had been forced to make in al|mo&s;t every P&s;alm. Some of his very
pretended emendations proved &s;uch, that the frequency of them directed me to
the di&s;covery of a more elegant metre than he had ever dreamed of, and which
con|vinced me, as they have &s;ince many more Hebrai&s;ts, that there was in
the metre of the P&s;alms, not only a real and &s;ettled di&s;tinction between
the long and the &s;hort &s;yllables, but that two of the latter were
equivalent, in the con&s;tituting of a foot or ver&s;e, to one of the former;
&s;o that they had at lea&s;t three different kinds of feet, viz. long
mono&s;yllables, bi&s;yl|lables, con&s;i&s;ting of two long, and
tri&s;ylla|bles, con&s;i&s;ting of two &s;hort and one long, or <HI>vice
ver&s;a;</HI> but which in the metre an|&s;wered to a &s;pondee, or two long
&s;yllables. Of this I gave &s;o many in&s;tances, as made me think, contrary
to what I had done till then, that the Hebrew metre was not &s;o irrecoverably
lo&s;t as I had imagined, and that a little more application than I 
<PB N="355" REF="357"> had time then, or have had &s;ince to be&s;tow upon it,
might go near to recover mo&s;t, if not all, the various kinds of it.</P>
<P>However, as &s;oon as I had fini&s;hed what I, and &s;ome of my
friends as well as I, thought a &s;ufficient confutation of the bi&s;hop's
performance, and in the &s;ame, tho' not &s;o florid and elegant a Latin, I
&s;ent to de&s;ire one of my book&s;ellers to enquire of Mr. Bowyer, whether
the new types, ca&s;t for his lord&s;hip, were &s;till in his
po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion? and whether I might be permitted the u&s;e of them, in the
an&s;wer I had pre|pared for the pre&s;s? I was an&s;wered in the affirmative;
but one book&s;eller took it into his head to a&s;k at the &s;ame time, what
number of copies his lord&s;hip had cau&s;ed to be printed of his P&s;alter?
and was an|&s;wered only five hundred; one half of which had been pre&s;ented
by his Lord&s;hip to his learned friends, both in and out of England, and
mo&s;t of the re&s;t were &s;till un&s;old, there being but few among the
learned, that were curious in &s;uch matters; the performance having been
di&s;approved by all that had &s;een it. This news &s;o cooled the
book&s;ellers eagerne&s;s after my an&s;wer, <PB N="356" REF="358"> that, upon
my coming to town, and their acquainting me with the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, I
was quite di&s;couraged from printing it. For they concluded from what Mr.
Bowyer had &s;aid, that it would be dangerous to print above three hundred of
mine, the charge of which being deducted, the profit, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition
that they were all &s;old, would be &s;o &s;mall, that they could not af|ford
me above two or three guineas for my copy (which would have made about &s;even
or eight &s;heets of a middling octavo) with|out being lo&s;ers. This was their
way of computing the matter, again&s;t which hav|ing nothing to object, I
locked up the pa|pers in my cabinet, where they have lain ever &s;ince. They
did indeed offer me better terms, and to print a greater number of copies, if I
would be at the trouble of print|ing it in Engli&s;h, which they thought would
be more univer&s;ally read, out of di&s;like to the bi&s;hop; but, be&s;ides
that I cared not to be at the pains of Engli&s;hing it, I thought it below the
&s;ubject to print it in any other language, but that in which his was wrote,
and &s;o wholly declined it.</P>
<P>I lodged then with the curate of the <PB N="357" REF="359">
pari&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Luke's, Old-&s;treet.</NOTE>, who, upon my
coming from Hamp&s;hire, told me the following &s;tory, which I give on his
authority, for I never enquired farther into it&mdash;That his rector, the
reverend Dr. Nichols, acquaint|ed the bi&s;hop, that he had a gentleman in his
pari&s;h, who de&s;igned &s;hortly to publi&s;h a confutation of his Hebrew
metre. The bi&s;hop a&s;ked whether he was equal to the ta&s;k? and was
an&s;wered, that he was thought &s;o by all that knew him, and that he was the
per&s;on who had wrote the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory, wherein he had given a greater
character of the He|brew poetry than his lord&s;hip &s;eemed to do in his book,
and that he was one of the per&s;ons concerned in the writing of the
Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory. The bi&s;hop then a&s;ked his name, and being told that
he called him&s;elf P&s;almanazar, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with &s;ome warmth
to the company, that there was never a Jew of them all that under&s;tood any
thing of Hebrew, much le&s;s of the &s;acred poetry; and being told that I was
no Jew, but in all appearance an hone&s;t and &s;trict churchman, who would
doubtle&s;s u&s;e his lord&s;hip with the re&s;pect due to 
<PB N="358" REF="360"> his character; he appeared a little better
&s;a|ti&s;fied, and willing to &s;u&s;pend his judgment, till he &s;aw what I
had to &s;ay again&s;t him.</P>
<P>And here I cannot forbear making an ob|&s;ervation, or two, on his
lord&s;hip's &s;peech, taking the &s;tory for true, which I am the more
inclined to believe to be &s;o, becau&s;e he was always known to have a
&s;ingular contempt of the Jews, &s;o far as related to their knowledge of the
Hebrew tongue. The one is, that his mean opinion of them mu&s;t be owing to his
&s;mall acquaintance with them; otherwi&s;e he might have found in London
&s;everal of them very learned in that tongue, (be&s;ides a much greater
num|ber abroad, e&s;pecially among the northern ones) and who, bating their
different interpretations of tho&s;e main prophecies which relate to the
Me&s;&s;iah, could have di&s;played to him a much greater and deeper &s;kill in
that &s;acred tongue, than he appears to have had, by any thing one can find in
his book. The other is, how his lord&s;hip came to take Salmanazar for a
Jewi&s;h, in&s;tead of an A&s;&s;yrian name; for as the monarch &s;o called,
was one of tho&s;e monarchs who carried away part of I&s;rael 
<PB N="359" REF="361"> captives into A&s;&s;yria; a Jew would as &s;oon call a
&s;on of his Beelzebub, as Salmanazar, or Nabuchadnezzar.</P>
<P>However, the abovementioned &s;tory, as well as the expectation
which my friends in Hamp&s;hire, Surry, and London, were in, to &s;ee my
an&s;wer to him, gave me no &s;mall regret, le&s;t my not publi&s;hing it
&s;hould be interpreted in favour of his per|formance, or as my yielding the
point to him, as not being able to confute him. And could I have afforded it, I
would have run the hazard of printing it at my own charge; for I was above
doing it by &s;ub|&s;cription, it being &s;o &s;mall a thing as a pamphlet of
at mo&s;t eight octavo &s;heets; and much more loth was I, all the above things
con&s;idered, to let a work &s;eemingly calculated to depreciate the excellence
of the &s;acred poetry of the Old Te&s;tament, to go uncen&s;ured; e&s;pecially
as I had &s;o many &s;trong objections ready levelled again&s;t it. At length a
thought came into my mind, as I was then preparing new materials for the
&s;econd part of the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory, to re&s;ume that &s;ubject there. And
this I thought, I was &s;o much better intitled to <PB N="360" REF="362"> do,
if it were but in defence of what I had &s;aid in the fir&s;t part in prai&s;e
of the Hebrew poetry, and which was, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, quite oppo&s;ite to the
character, which his lord&s;hip gave of it in his book. The collecting, and
compleating of the canon of the &s;acred books by Ezra, and other in&s;pired
writers, and their appointing of the proper le&s;&s;ons, p&s;alms, &amp;c. for
the divine wor&s;hip, gave me a fair opportunity for it, which I was the more
ready to take, as I knew that it would be read by many more people in &s;uch a
work as that, than in a Latin pamphlet, and would of cour&s;e more effectually
expo&s;e the ab&s;urdity of his pretended new-found metre, as well as the
un&s;eemly freedom he hath given him&s;elf in altering and mutilating the
&s;acred text for the &s;ake of it. I therefore re&s;olved to take notice, in
ju&s;tice to his lord&s;hip, of all ju&s;t, laudable, and u&s;eful
di&s;coveries he had made on that &s;ubject in the text, and to throw the main
part of my objections again&s;t the re&s;t of his book in a long note, in the
mo&s;t &s;uccinct and impartial manner I could, in hopes that the &s;etting
both forth, as it were, in one view, might probably <PB N="361" REF="363">
excite &s;ome who had more learning and lei&s;ure than I, to follow the hints
there given, as the mo&s;t likely means for compleating the de&s;ired
di&s;covery, to which his lord&s;hip had in a great mea&s;ure opened the way,
though he had &s;o unhappily mi&s;carried in the end. The difficulty was how to
con|tract my materials &s;o as not to over-&s;well that part of the work, as it
mu&s;t have done if I had brought every thing into it, which I had wrote on
that &s;ubject, and this obliged me to &s;trike off near two thirds of them,
and to confine my&s;elf to the mo&s;t material points, &s;uch as would mo&s;t
effectually an|&s;wer the two main ends I had in view, viz. the exploding the
bi&s;hop's new metre, and giving the curious reader, that would go about it, a
clue to find out the original one of the &s;acred books; for as to what I
de&s;igned to have &s;aid in prai&s;e of the Hebrew poetry, had the &s;ubject
been printed &s;eparately, it was the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary here, as I had
already expatiated &s;o much upon it in the fir&s;t volume. Some of the
pro|prietors and authors were indeed again&s;t my de&s;ign, not only as it
would &s;well the chapter beyond its length, but likewi&s;e as 
<PB N="362" REF="364"> the &s;ubject in que&s;tion appeared to them, foreign to
the re&s;t of its contents; but I had the plea&s;ure not only to carry my point
again&s;t them, but likewi&s;e to have the performance commended by &s;everal
learned men as well as by all my friends; in&s;omuch that upon my con&s;ult|ing
&s;everal of them, whether I might not in the &s;econd or octavo edition (in
which we were obliged to contract our materials, in order to reduce the whole
within the propo&s;ed limits) either wholly omit or content my&s;elf with a
&s;hort men|tion of what I had done more at large in the folio; they advi&s;ed
me by no means to curtail the main &s;ubject, though I might, they thought,
eraze here and there an ex|planatory or critical note, which I readily complied
with.</P>
<P>Soon after I had concluded my la&s;t part of the Ancient
Hi&s;tory, the proprietors and authors had &s;ome meetings together to
con&s;ult upon the going on with the Mo|dern, and &s;everal plans were
propo&s;ed by different per&s;ons of learning and capacity. The misfortune was,
that this part likewi&s;e was to be confined within the compa&s;s of 
<PB N="363" REF="365"> twenty volumes, of the &s;ame bulk with the Ancient, and
the&s;e gentlemen differed &s;o much in the proportion they allowed to each
re&s;pective country or kingdom, that we could &s;ee but little likelihood of
mak|ing any tolerable computation, either of what the whole might rea&s;onably
amount to, or of what number of &s;heets might be properly allowed to each
hi&s;tory. As for me, the more I con&s;idered the great ex|tent of the work,
and the number of em|pires and kingdoms which had not &s;o much as been touched
upon in the Ancient part, &s;uch as Turkey, India, the great Mogul, Tartary,
China, Japan, &amp;c. the greate&s;t part of Africa, and the whole tract of
America, to &s;ay nothing of Ru&s;&s;ia and &s;everal other northern countries
in Europe; the more I was per&s;uaded of the impo&s;|&s;ibility of reducing the
whole within &s;o &s;mall a number of volumes, unle&s;s it was done rather by
way of epitome, than of compleat, though ever &s;o &s;uccinct, a hi&s;|tory.
But though this appeared &s;till more vi&s;ible by the &s;mall number of
&s;heets which the&s;e plans, however different, allotted to mo&s;t parts of
the work, and mu&s;t have <PB N="364" REF="366" MS="y"> received by almo&s;t
every reader, at the fir&s;t view, yet the proprietors who had their particular
rea&s;ons for fixing upon that number of volumes, would by no means con&s;ent
to have it exceeded. This how|ever occa&s;ioned &s;ome demur, during which
&s;ome of the be&s;t judges in this kingdom, and out of it, were con&s;ulted,
as well as about the propere&s;t method of beginning and pur&s;uing this modern
part.</P>
