<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Tran&s;ylvania.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TRANSYLVANIA is environed on all &s;ides with mountains, whence it enjoys a temperate air and whole&s;ome river waters. It is both woody and mountainous; yet the &s;oil in the vallies is fertile, and produces every nece&s;&s;ary of life. The mountains run from north to &s;outh, branching out likewi&s;e ea&s;t and we&s;t. The Carpathian mountains divide it from Poland on the north, Moldavia on the ea&s;t, Wala|chia and a part of Hungary on the &s;outh, and on the we&s;t by the principal provinces of Hungary.</P>
<P>The province of Tran&s;ylvania extends from 45 deg. to 48 deg. north latitude; and from the 22d to the the 25th deg. ea&s;t longitude, from the meridian of London: being about 40 leagues in length from north to &s;outh, and about as many from ea&s;t to we&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4">The air is exce&s;&s;ively hot in &s;ummer, but, notwith|&s;tanding, it is reckoned very whole&s;ome. The water which comes from &s;ome of the &s;prings is accounted unwhole&s;ome, on account of the pernicious quality of the mineral &s;ub&s;tances through which it pa&s;&s;es. The famous river Atlanta takes its ri&s;e in the Carpa|thian mountains, and falls into the Danube. It is the boundary of the Ottoman and German empires.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, there are the Meri&s;h and Samos, two large rivers, both which di&s;embogue them&s;elves into the Tey&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal mineral &s;prings, &s;ome cold and &s;ome hot; and a &s;ingular petrifying &s;pring, that re|&s;olves every kind of wood into a kind of a congealed &s;ub&s;tance, re&s;embling &s;tone.</P>
<P>In this country there are four different kinds of in|habitants; the fir&s;t originally Saxons; the &s;econd Huns; the third Walachians; and the fourth Cinga, or gyp&s;ies. The&s;e la&s;t pitch their tents in all conve|nient parts of the country; are in fact a &s;ort of licen&s;ed vagrants, and, as in England, deceive the credulous part of the fair &s;ex, who are fond of the flat|tery of fortune-tellers.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gyp&s;ies &s;pread over all Bohemia and Germa|ny, as well as Hungary: a gyp&s;y in the German lan|guage

being called a <HI>Bohemian.</HI> They dre&s;s as do the Bohemians, in the Engli&s;h habit. We have given a plate repre&s;enting one, alarming the mind of a Flemi&s;h traveller, from an original drawing of <HI>Tenier.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;ingular that throughout the world, human na|ture &s;hould be &s;o &s;trongly impregnated with a de&s;ire to know future events; and that nothing can &s;tem the cre|dulity of both &s;exes, whil&s;t the juvenile pa&s;&s;ions are warm; that &s;atisfaction of being told &s;ome fable from the ca|binet of genius, whence the roving diviner draws the &s;ource of a ca&s;ual &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, or rather exi&s;tence, by the futile productions of a fanta&s;tic brain, &s;tored with luxuriant imagery to &s;olace the giddy youth of either &s;ex, who gladly pays the impo&s;tor's price, and for years to come lays up the tale as part of the creed of fortune, nor dares to overtop the &s;eer's &s;age advice!</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion in Tran&s;ylvania, is the Ro|man-catholic, as in all the re&s;t of the Emperor's here|ditary dominions; but neverthele&s;s there are great numbers of Lutherans, Calvini&s;ts, and Prote&s;tants of all denominations, who are great &s;ufferers on account of their religion. The &s;everity exerci&s;ed towards them, has been the occa&s;ion of many in&s;urrections; but we &s;ee the day approaching, and probably not far di&s;tant when the dark rece&s;&s;es of bigotry, and the tattered cloak of religion will be finally removed from the Imperial dominions: the late <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> has done much,
<PB N="6" REF="7">
and it is to be hoped the pre&s;ent <HI>Leopold</HI> will do more; but we &s;hall &s;peak more of this hereafter, in de&s;cribing of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>It may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay that Tran&s;ylvania, is annexed to the kingdom of Hungary; con&s;equently &s;ubject to the Emperor of Germany. This province has been conquered by the Hungarians &s;o early as the year 1004.</P>
<P>But it is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that the govern|ment of Tran&s;ylvania is totally different from that of Hungary, although united under one crown; which has induced us to mention it &s;eparately, as appears by the approbata, concordata, and diplomata, or joint con&s;ent of prince and people, formed into a kind of an Ari&s;tocratical government: which is carried on in the name of the prince and nobility by the diet, the office of &s;tate, the royal government, the exchequer, the a&s;&s;embly of courts, the tribunals of ju&s;tice, and the magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>The diets meet by &s;ummons from the prince at the capital, and are divided into an upper and lower table. The fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of the prelates, counts, and barons; and the &s;econd, of the king's council, the deputies and tribunes: and at both, &s;its a pre&s;ident, who re|pre&s;ents the &s;overeign, and draws up and &s;ends the Emperor their deliberations for his &s;anction or royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">The high government which re&s;ides at Herman|&s;tadt, &s;uperintends the affairs of the principality, whether temporal or &s;piritual. At the head of it is a governor, with the commi&s;&s;ioners of the three nations, catholicks, the reformed and prote&s;tants. The po|lice of the whole nation is divided into &s;even grand tribunals, each governed by a count, and four inferior ones, under the juri&s;diction of judges or magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>The revenue of this country ari&s;es from the cu&s;toms on metals, minerals, royal deme&s;nes and confi&s;cations. Hermand&s;tadt is the capital, which is plea&s;antly &s;itu|ated on the banks of the river Cibin, about 80 miles N. E. of Teme&s;waer. This is a royal free town, &s;eated in a plain, being large and well built, and for|tified with a double wall and deep moat, which ren|der it, in general, very &s;trong.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o the &s;eat of government, as was before ob|&s;erved, and is governed by the royal chamber, the tribunal of appeal and the diet; be&s;ides which the commanding general and royal governor of the Saxon nation have their re&s;idence in this place.</P>
<P>The church of the Lutherans here is built, as near as can be, on the model of St. Peter's, at Rome. There is a Gymna&s;ium likewi&s;e. It is a bi&s;hopric. Cron&s;tadt or Corunna, is the next in magnitude, which is 50 miles N. E. of Herman&s;tadt: be&s;ide the&s;e,
<PB N="8" REF="9">
there are &s;ix or &s;even &s;maller cities and towns of little note.</P>
<P>Cattle, fowls, and other animals, are very nume|rous and cheap in Tran&s;ylvania; and the wild bees are a peculiar branch of commerce in this country, as great quantities of honey and wax are exported to all parts of Europe from them.</P>
<P>The only manufactures of this country, be&s;ides tho&s;e of iron, tin and copper, are cloth, tallow, wine, mead, and rock-&s;alt.</P>
<P>The manners and cu&s;toms of the inhabitants of Tran|&s;ylvania are rather &s;ingular; for at their funerals the women, in the true &s;tile of Hibernian &s;orrow, &s;et up a howl, and follow the corps to the grave, with all the apparent marks of grief, till the body is interred; and then they &s;everally greet each other with perhaps a &s;miling countenance, or a hearty laugh, and it is not improbable &s;ome of the mock mourners may a&s;k who the decea&s;ed was! Thus they are &s;orrowful, and lamentably oppre&s;&s;ed externally, as &s;hewing marks of de&s;pair and agony, for the lo&s;s of one whom per|haps they do not know!</P>
<P>The cloathing of the Tran&s;ylvanians, is u&s;ually a wai&s;tcoat, over which is a &s;hort loo&s;e coat lined with fur: their breeches and &s;tockings are of one piece,
<PB N="9" REF="10">
and &s;it clo&s;e to the leg and thigh, with clogs &s;hod with iron, and on the head a cap like that of an Engli&s;h light dragoon, lined with fur. And like the Germans, they never become acquainted with any one till they have got drunk together.</P>
<P>They are very fond of mu&s;ic and dancing, as well as various &s;ports which exerci&s;e the agility of the body. And there is no pea&s;ant, be his &s;tation ever &s;o low, but what pretends to be the de&s;cendant of &s;ome great family. Thus a Scotchman, a Welchman, and a Tran&s;ylvanian will equally agree on the topic of noble ance&s;try, flatter them&s;elves, or at lea&s;t each other, that they are men of honour; and will a&s;&s;ume a title very un&s;uitable to the rank or mean occupation they are nece&s;&s;arily engaged in; which ridiculous idea mu&s;t cau&s;e every hone&s;t Engli&s;hman to exerci&s;e his mu&s;cu|lar features in a hearty fit of laughter.</P>
<P>Tran&s;ylvania is part of the ancient Dacia, the inha|bitants of which long employed the Roman arms be|fore they could be &s;ubdued. Their de&s;cendants &s;till retain a military character. The population of the country is not a&s;certained. But it is a&s;&s;erted by mo&s;t of the modern writers that this country can produce an army of 30,000 men, con&s;equently the whole number mu&s;t be very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">At pre&s;ent its military force is reduced to &s;ix regi|ments of 1500 men each; but it is well known that during the la&s;t war, in which the Au&s;trians were en|gaged, the Tran&s;ylvanians did great &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The various revolutions in their government prove their impatience under &s;lavery; and though the treaty of Carlowitz, in 1690, gave the &s;overeignty of Tran|&s;ylvania to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, yet the natives enjoy what they call a loyal ari&s;tocracy, which their &s;ove|reign does not think proper to invade.</P>
<P>Although Hermand&s;tadt is its only bi&s;hoprick, yet it is to all appearance quite &s;ufficient; as the natives, at pre&s;ent, &s;eem very little inclined to concern them&s;elves with religion, learning, or any &s;cience human or di|vine.</P>

<PB N="11" REF="12">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Hungarian Illyricum, or the Kingdoms of Sclavonia, Croa|tia, and Dalmatia.</HEAD>
<P>MODERN Sclavonia is bounded by the Drave and Danube, which &s;eparates it from Hun|gary towards the N. and E. by the river Save, which divides it from Servia and Bo&s;nia on the S. and by Styria on the W. is computed to be upwards of 200 miles long, and about 70 broad: and lies between 16 and 22 deg. of E. long, and 45 and 47 deg. of N. latitude.</P>
<P>The air is good, the country for the mo&s;t part level, and not much incumbered with woods and moun|tains, but exceedingly well watered by tho&s;e noble rivers, the Danube, Save, and Drave, be&s;ides many le&s;&s;er &s;treams; from whence we may conclude it to be a very fruitful country.</P>
<P>The bounds of the re&s;pective divi&s;ions or counties of this province have been &s;o frequently altered, as being a frontier between Turkey and Chri&s;tendom, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to lay down its exact dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">The chief or capital town of the fir&s;t divi&s;ion, called the Banat, is that of Po&s;ega, or Ro&s;ega, &s;ituated in lat. 45 deg. N. on the river Oriana, 120 miles W. of Bel|grade. It con&s;i&s;ts of about 1000 hou&s;es, and is a place of good trade. Walpo is the next town of note; E&s;&s;eck next, famous for its bridge, near the con|fluence of the Drave and the Danube, which has al|ready been de&s;cribed in treating of Hungary. Peter|waradin, Carlowitz, Semlim, and Gradi&s;ka, are places well known in the late war between the Turks and Imperiali&s;ts.</P>
<P>The natives of Sclavonia are of a good &s;tature and &s;ound con&s;titution, well adapted to laborious employ|ments. The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned by &s;everal authors, that Hungary, Tran&s;ylvania, Sclavonia, and other nations &s;ubject to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, in tho&s;e parts contain a &s;urpri&s;ing variety of people, differing in name, lan|guage, and manners, is, becau&s;e liberty here made its la&s;t &s;tand again&s;t the Roman arms, which by degrees forced the remains of the different nations they had conquered into tho&s;e quarters.</P>
<P>The thickne&s;s of woods, the rapidity of rivers, and the &s;trength of the country in Sclavonia, favoured their re&s;i&s;tance: and their de&s;cendants, notwith&s;tand|ing the power of the Turks, Au&s;trians, Hungarians, and Poles, &s;till retain the &s;ame &s;pirit of independency. Without minding the arrangements of Europe, they
<PB N="13" REF="14">
are quiet under the government that leaves them mo&s;t at liberty. That they are generous as well as brave, ap|pears from their attachment to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, which, till the la&s;t two or three wars, never was &s;en|&s;ible of their value and valour.</P>
<P>The Sclavonians formerly gave &s;o much work to the Roman army, that it is thought the word &s;lave took its original from them, on account of the great numbers of them that were carried into bondage, &s;o late as the reign of Charlemagne.</P>
<P>Though Sclavonia yields neither in beauty nor fer|tility to Hungary and Tran&s;ylvania; yet the ravages of war are &s;till vi&s;ible in the face of the country, which lies in a great mea&s;ure unimproved.</P>
<P>The navigable rivers which pa&s;s through this pro|vince, render it exceedingly proper, to carry on trade between the German empire and Turkey. But the misfortune is, that notwith&s;tanding the&s;e frontier-coun|tries are ble&s;&s;ed with all the advantages that nature can be&s;tow upon them, yet great part of them are of|ten a perfect de&s;art, and only con&s;iderable for the &s;trength of their towns, and the number of their gar|ri&s;ons, which are always pernicious to trade and hu&s;|bandry; for none will attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h manufac|tures or improve their lands, where the &s;oldier perhaps will probably reap the fruits of their labour.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">The whole province being now under the dominion of the Emperor, the Roman-catholic is the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed religion, though Greeks and Jews are tolerated. There are two bi&s;hoprics, that of Ro&s;ega and Zagrab: but no univer&s;ities.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are compo&s;ed of Servians, Radzi|ans, Croats, Walachians, Germans, Hungarians, and a great number of other nations as the military mu&s;ter-roll &s;pecifies, whenever the Emperor has occa&s;ion for their &s;ervices.</P>
<P>In the late war with the Porte, this province was over-run by the Turks, and ravaged with all the ter|rors of war; &s;o that it will be many years before it re|covers its lo&s;&s;es in the articles of building, furniture, &amp;c. But with re&s;pect to the face of the country little injury can be &s;u&s;tained there, as the animal verdure and agricultural indu&s;try of the hu&s;bandman &s;upply every defect occa&s;ioned by the untimely incur&s;ions of the enemy's troops.</P>
<P>Croatia lies between the 15th and 17th degrees of ea&s;t longitude, and the 45th and 47th of north la|titude. It reaches from the river Drave to the Adri|atic, turning ea&s;tward on Sclavonia and Bothnia; we&s;twardly on Stiria and Carniola. It is 80 miles in length, and about 70 broad.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">The chief towns are Carl&s;tadt or Carlowitz, the capital of Imperial Croatia, &s;ituated on the ri|ver Culp, 20 miles &s;outhward of the Save; and be|ing a frontier-town is tolerably well fortified; Ca&s;ta|novitz, is &s;ituated on the river Unna, 30 miles we&s;tward of Gradi&s;ka.</P>
<P>This country is naturally fruitful, producing plenty of corn, wine, and oil, where it is cultivated; but, being a frontier again&s;t the Turks, it has not yielded much more than would &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of the inhabitants of late years.</P>
<P>The people are of a good &s;tature; and in their man|ners, cu&s;toms, language, government, and laws, are modelled exactly like the Sclavonians, who are their neighbours.</P>
<P>They are excellent irregular troops, and as &s;uch are famed in modern hi&s;tory, under the name of Pandoms, and various other de&s;ignations. The truth is, the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria finds it its intere&s;t in &s;uffering them and the neighbouring nations to live in their own manner. All the &s;overeignty exerci&s;ed over them by the Au&s;trians, &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in the military ar|rangements, for bringing them occa&s;ionally into the field.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">The Croatians derive their origin from the Sclavi, who were the fir&s;t inhabitants of Sclavonia, and an|ciently had kings of their own, who were &s;tiled kings of Croatia, and tributary to the emperor of the Ea&s;t. In the 11th century, Croatia devolved to the king of Hungary, and the Croats have continued ever &s;ince under the dominion of that monarchy, though not without frequent attempts to recover their inde|pendency.</P>
<P>Dalmatia, or Hungarian Delmacia as it is u&s;ually called, lies on the upper part of the Adriatic &s;ea, and con&s;i&s;ts of five di&s;tricts, mo&s;t of which are under the general&s;hip of Carl&s;tadt. This country is of very an|cient date. Mo&s;t cabinets produce coins and in&s;crip|tions of the atchievements of its kings previous to the building of Rome, There was a famous city called Dalmatia, which was the capital, and was took and de&s;troyed by the Romans about the 597th year after the building of Rome.</P>
<P>Various changes took place, till at length the coun|try became &s;ubject in a great mea&s;ure to the Hun|garians: but at pre&s;ent the Venetians, Turks, and Ragu&s;ans claim part of it. The maritime towns are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Republic of Venice. The two latter powers po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome of the interior parts of this king|dom, which is now reduced to a province.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">The rivers of Dalmatia have no long cour&s;e, but are mo&s;tly navigable. The country is as it were &s;trewed with mountains. The &s;oil on them is very fruitful and produces olives, vines, myrtles, and a great variety of palatable and whole&s;ome vegetables growing upon them, be&s;ides trea&s;ures of gold and &s;ilver ore within them. It has al&s;o many fertile plains, and be&s;ides a &s;ufficiency of horned cattle, feeds large numbers of &s;heep. The air is temperate and pure.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable places are the two following viz. Segna and Otto&s;chatz. The fir&s;t is a royal, free town fortified both by nature and art, &s;ituated near the &s;ea, in a bleak, mountainous and barren &s;oil.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of this place is a &s;uffragan to the arch|bi&s;hop of Spalatro. Here are twelve churches, and two convents. The governor re&s;ides in the old palace called the royal ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The la&s;t mentioned town, is a frontier fortification on the river Gatzka. That part of the fortre&s;s where the governor, and the greate&s;t part of the garri&s;on re&s;ide, is &s;urrounded with a wall and &s;ome towers; but the re&s;t of the buildings, which are but mean, are erected on piles in the water, &s;o that one neigh|bour cannot vi&s;it another without a boat.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19">Near Segna dwell the U&s;cocs, or Hu&s;cocks, a people who, being galled by oppre&s;&s;ion, e&s;caped out of Turki&s;h Dalmatia, from whence they obtained the name of U&s;cocs from the word Scoco, which &s;ignifies a de&s;erter or run-away. They are al&s;o called Springers or Leapers, from the agility with which they leap, rather than walk along this rugged, and mountainous country. Some of them live in &s;cat|tered hou&s;es, and others in large villages. They are a rough &s;avage people; large bodied, courageous, and given to rapine; but their vi&s;ible employment is grazing.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the native U&s;coc, is rather curious, they wear a coar&s;e, baize jacket, belted round the wai&s;t, and generally green; a pair of blue linen trow&s;ers, red &s;tockings, and wooden &s;hoes in winter, but light &s;lippers in &s;ummer. Their head-attire is a cap of woollen with a ta&s;&s;el, like our charity-chil|dren in England, and a loo&s;e cloak gathered at the neck. Their arms are a long knife in a &s;heath, with a long pole. They al&s;o know perfectly well the u&s;e of fire arms, but generally prefer a bow and arrows.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the female is a jacket and petticoat, of green baize in winter, or blue linen in &s;ummer; half-boots and a &s;traw bonnet. The &s;uperfluous
<PB N="19" REF="20">
appendages of dre&s;s are not here, con&s;equently the luxury of that article is deemed a matter unworthy the notice of the uncultivated inhabitant.</P>
<P>In their religion, they come neare&s;t to the Greek church, but &s;ome are Roman-catholics. They have an arch-bi&s;hop, bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts and monks. The prie&s;ts are not prohibited marriage, but their wives mu&s;t be of a good family, which is only to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for the multiplicity of its flocks and herds. But at her decea&s;e they are pro&s;cribed from &s;econd marriage. Their children are not baptized till they are adults. None among them go to confe&s;&s;ion till they are thirty years of age. They are &s;trong pre|de&s;tinarians.</P>
<P>In their language they u&s;e a dialect of the Wala|chian. Literature is not cultivated, con&s;equently all the refinements of a polite education are unknown to them. Therefore it is not to be wondered at, if they de&s;pi&s;e what they deem an unnece&s;&s;ary ta&s;k. To in&s;tance this, we need go no further than the natives of our own country, who are as ready to cen&s;ure li|terary acqui&s;itions as the U&s;cocs po&s;&s;ibly can be, if they are without letters them&s;elves.

knowledge, becau&s;e he is unacquainted with their efficacy and valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>The Hungarian Illyricum produces every nece&s;&s;ary of life in plenty, and we may add, many of its &s;uperfluities al&s;o. Its chief rivers are the Drave, Save, Danube, Culpa, Unna, and Maraka: all which di&s;charge them&s;elves in the Adriatic &s;ea. All the inhabitants are of Sclavonian extraction, and, according to the different provinces, divided into a different people.</P>
<P>The principal nations are tho&s;e already de&s;cribed, who make as it were one people with the Hungarians. The le&s;&s;er parts or &s;ubdivi&s;ions, &s;uch as Sclavonia and Ra&s;cia, have a mixture of Germans and Hungarians among&s;t them. The Croats are augmented by colo|nies from Germany and Wallachia. The Dalma|tians, including the U&s;cocs ju&s;t now de&s;cribed, who may be termed chri&s;tian refugees from Bulgaria, Servia and Thrace, with the Marulachians or Black Latins, a people much like them, are the other branch of the Huns, fa&s;hioning their manners and &s;haping their attention to the cu&s;tom of their neare&s;t neigh|bours. However, the U&s;cocs may &s;till be &s;aid to be partial to their ancient Garb, as has already been de|&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">The Illyrians, in general, apply them&s;elves to trade, agriculture or war; but to the&s;e arts the Dalmatians add navigation, in which they are very bold and ex|pert.</P>
<P>The only religion publicly tolerated throughout Hungarian Illyria is that of the Roman-catholic. Mo&s;t of the bi&s;hops have Hungarian titles without reve|nues. The government of all the countries, de&s;cribed in this chapter &s;eem to have a connexion together, notwith&s;tanding they are three &s;everal kingdoms or rather large provinces. The government of Sclavo|nia and Croatia is connected with that of Hungary and Stiria, being hereditary in the arch-ducal hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. The government of Dalmatia is three-fold. That of Venetian Dalmatia is admini&s;tered by certain proveditors in the name of the republic of Venice. Turki&s;h Dalmatia is governed by a Ba&s;haw, de|puted by the grand Seignior: and the government of Ragu&s;an-Dalmatia is lodged in a rector and magi&s;|trate under the protection of Hungary, Turkey and Venice.</P>
<P>The prelates, nobility, gentry, and royal free Ca&s;|tellans, enjoy the &s;ame privileges with the Hunga|rians. At the diets, which con&s;i&s;t of the four orders of each province, all deliberations run in the name of the Sovereign. At the Hungarian diets the &s;tates of Illyria appear by repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23">The admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in Sclavonia and the Bannat of Croatia is the &s;ame as in Hungary: the free towns having inferior courts, from whence cau&s;es may be removed to the royal trea&s;urer. The like al&s;o have other towns, from whence there lies an ap|peal to the Bannat-court, which is &s;o called from the ban or prorex, who is pre&s;ident thereof. And this man at certain times, hears cau&s;es brought to him from the go&s;penchafts, holding con&s;ultations on other im|portant matters: &s;ometimes when the cau&s;es require a further in&s;pection, he di&s;mi&s;&s;es the litigants to the ta|bula regalis at Pe&s;t, from whence they may proceed farther to that of the &s;even men.</P>
<P>The public revenue ari&s;es from contributions, cu&s;toms, trade, tillage and grazing: and is divided between the king of Hungary in the per&s;on of the Emperor of Germany, the republic of Venice, the grand &s;ignior and the Ragu&s;ian &s;tates, according to the extent of their &s;everal dominions.</P>
<P>The military force of the Hungarian Illyrians is very con&s;iderable, and, when in a collective body, mu&s;ters at lea&s;t an hundred thou&s;and able troops, fit to endure the hard&s;hips of a campaign in any quarter of the globe. The late emperor <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> II. highly applauded the per&s;onal bravery and intrepidity of the army collected from tho&s;e parts, as they were well &s;uited to oppo&s;e the ferocity of the Turks, who are
<PB N="23" REF="24">
in battle frantic to excel each other in the honours of the field; upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that he who dies in the bed of honour, in defence of his religion, king, and country, directly partakes of the paradi&s;e of the ble&s;s|ed in the regions of life beyond the grave.</P>
<P>Though the peculiar happine&s;s of our government leads every thinking &s;ubject to di&s;clo&s;e freely his &s;enti|ments, as far as he may judge them conducive to the na|tural welfare; yet in &s;peaking of public affairs, the mind ought in a peculiar manner to be dive&s;ted of all pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or it can an&s;wer no end but to adopt or confirm a principle, which, though true, lo&s;es its charms by being founded in prejudice.</P>
<P>If the pur&s;uit of wi&s;dom and virtue is the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of life, we ought to examine before we pro|nounce &s;entence, and always to be diffident, where we have not had opportunities of knowledge. I am very &s;en&s;ible that even general reflections on political intere&s;t belong to tho&s;e who are grown grey in expe|rience, rather than for tran&s;ient &s;pectators.</P>
<P>How can it be imagined in an age in which cor|ruption abounds not in England only, but in every country, that only virtuous men &s;hould be in office? To rail at them, without con&s;idering the corruption of mankind in general, mu&s;t render the complainant &s;u&s;|pected
<PB N="24" REF="25">
of di&s;content, becau&s;e he is not in office him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>When the influence of the crown preponderates and the mea&s;ures which are pur&s;ued do not imme|diately produce all the good we fondly expected: the &s;ubjects who do not receive any pecuniary advan|tages from government, (for others have generally the wit to hold their tongues) are apt to cry out again&s;t the court, or again&s;t the mini&s;ter, forgetting that the true &s;ource of national calamities in a free &s;tate is the venality and impiety of the people.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this chapter with a remark on poli&s;hed &s;tates, in order to contra&s;t the&s;e with the foregoing countries which are &s;carcely yet civilized.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age of a merchant from one country to ano|ther in pur&s;uit of commercial affairs, ought not to be con&s;idered in the &s;ame light as the travels of a man of letters, in &s;earch of arts or learning; but if in the cour&s;e of their ob&s;ervations, they have &s;upported one common &s;pirit of national affection; in proportion to their advantages of education and natural abilities, the effect will be in a great degree &s;imilar. Their own country mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily become the dearer to them according as they di&s;cover the &s;uperiority it en|joys in laws and government above other nations.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">Being thus excited by a generous emulation, in|&s;tead of bringing home the vices of other countries, they will &s;trive to plant the virtues which are more peculiar to foreign climes and not the proper growth of their own &s;oil.</P>
<P>The ravages of time, the ruins of cities, the de&s;o|lation of countries, the tyranny of kings, the folly and iniquity of &s;ubjects in &s;elling them&s;elves like bea&s;ts to the &s;laughter; with all the pernicious effects of arbitary power, mu&s;t in a &s;erious mind draw re|flections on the uncertainty of human affairs.</P>
<P>By tracing the&s;e events, as near as po&s;&s;ible to their &s;ource, the heart will be lifted up to the great Au|thor of nature, and adopt a con&s;i&s;tent principle con|cerning the general law of his moral government, by ob&s;erving that vice is ever productive of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Though the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence are &s;ome|times incomprehen&s;ible, yet this ought not to weaken a &s;teady per&s;ua&s;ion, that virtue is in every region, and under every government, acceptable to him. <HI>"That what he delights in mu&s;t be happy,"</HI> however the face of things may appear. And to check every fond pre&s;umption of independency, though we gra&s;p the fleeting moments, it is but as to-morrow, when a curtain will be drawn over all the glories as well as the mi&s;eries of this world.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27">In the mean while, whether we go abroad or remain at home, enjoy a profu&s;ion or mediocrity of the gifts of Providence, we are travelling to another country. Our noble&s;t &s;cience, our highe&s;t accompli&s;hment and &s;upreme felicity, is the knowledge and ob&s;ervance of that compa&s;s who&s;e needle points to our proper home; to tho&s;e regions where millions of ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits in|habit: where the eye will be &s;atisfied with &s;eeing, the under&s;tanding with knowledge, and the heart with delights, of which this world can give but faint ideas.</P>
<P>Let us not de&s;pi&s;e therefore, the uncultivated tribes of the countries ju&s;t now de&s;cribed, from a &s;uppo|&s;ition that we are of a &s;uperior order of mortals, or have a prior right to the attention of the Deity: for as in every nation he that doth the will of God is ac|cepted; it is not to be under&s;tood that this <HI>will</HI> is a particular &s;y&s;tem laid down by men; but it is to be under&s;tood to &s;erve one another in brotherly love, or as a celebrated author &s;tiles it <HI>"public love."</HI> Then, of cour&s;e, we &s;hall adore that Being who hath done all things for his good plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In a word, whether we are hackneyed in the paths of gain and ambition; or pur&s;uing the delights of a philo&s;ophic and religious ca&s;t of thought, life &s;till ebbs out much fa&s;ter than we are aware of, or can ea&s;ily di&s;cover; or even to deal fairly with our&s;elves to ac|knowledge.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Country, Climate, Productions, and Polity.</HEAD>
<P>GERMANY was anciently called the Holy Roman Empire, its bounds was very different from the modern; the Danube being looked up|on as the &s;outhern, and the Rhine as the we&s;tern limits of it, yet it was extended &s;o far north as to include Scandinavia. But the bounds of modern

<PB N="29" REF="31">
Germany including Bohemia and Sile&s;ia already de|&s;cribed, are the Baltic &s;ea, Denmark and the Ger|man ocean to the north; Poland and Hungary on the ea&s;t; the Gulph of Venice, and the Alps, which divide it from Italy, towards the &s;outh, and France, and the low countries towards the we&s;t: extending from 45 deg. 30 min. N. lat. to 54 deg. 30 min. and from the 6th. to the 19th deg. of ea&s;t long. from the meridian of London.</P>
<P>The air in the &s;outhern provinces is temperate, and healthful, and the &s;oil extremely fruitful; but towards the north, it is very cold, and &s;evere in the winter, and the land by far le&s;s prolific, producing none of the fruits of the warmer climates, or the oils or wines which are &s;o plentiful in the &s;outh. The open or level parts enjoy a different air from the mountainous; and the deep, moi&s;t and mar&s;hy places feel different from the more elevated, dry and &s;andy parts: hence al&s;o, the produce of the fields, gardens, and trees, ripen at different times in one place to what they do in another. Formerly Germany was very woody, but it has now few of tho&s;e valu|able fore&s;ts that were it's former boa&s;t, &s;o that the natives figuratively feel the evil effect of the prodi|gality of their ance&s;tors, who wantonly cut down the woods to &s;upply them&s;elves with fuel, and to build hou&s;es; in&s;tead of rai&s;ing the former out of the coal pits, or making bricks of the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32">The productions of Germany are very numerous; and its agriculture is every day improving; thus it is rendered annually more fertile, rich, and beautiful. It yields all kinds of grain in plenty: and many of the American products; tobacco, rice, and &s;affron, are cultivated with great &s;ucce&s;s, and every &s;pecies of herbs is found in great plenty in the gardens of the curious.</P>
<P>The German wines are known under the denomi|tion of Rheni&s;h, Mozel, Franconian, Neckar, Cocher, and Mu&s;cadel. Lemons, oranges, olives, almonds, figs, and che&s;nuts are the productions of the &s;outhern parts of Germany, as well as of France, Spain, or Ita|ly: but the northern parts are &s;o fertile in the pro|ducts of our own country, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary to enumerate them. Their cattle, fowls, and other tame animals are commonly the &s;ame &s;pecies as tho&s;e found in England: but their exotics are, bears, wolves, linx|es, wild-boars, wild-cats, wild-goats, and a &s;pecies of leopard, and another of beavers; be&s;ides the u&s;ual wild-bea&s;ts, we find here, &s;uch as foxes, badgers, polecats, &amp;c. The cha&s;es in Germany are exten|&s;ive, and numerous, abounding with deer, hares, rabbits, &amp;c. nor is game of any kind wanting to employ the &s;port&s;man.</P>
<P>The mineral kingdom is likewi&s;e very full of ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;upplies in this empire; the &s;and-&s;tone, ala|ba&s;ter,
<PB N="31" REF="33">
&s;hiver, variegated marble, cornelian, chalce|dony, onyx, ja&s;per, and various &s;pecies of chry&s;tals and precious &s;tones, &s;uch as diamonds, rubies, &s;ap|phires, emeralds, amethy&s;ts, and carbuncles, are found in different parts of Germany.</P>
<P>Of the &s;pecies of ore, I &s;hall only enumerate, vi|triol, allum, &s;alt-petre, &s;pring-&s;alt, and &s;tone-coal; and the mineral productions &s;uch as virgin and quick-&s;ilver, black amber, &s;ulphur, bizmuth; and of me|tals, only iron, &s;teel, lead, gold and &s;ilver. Added to the&s;e there are various petrifactions in the form of different objects, both in the animal and vegetable kingdoms found in this country.</P>
<P>The number of the excellent acid waters and Fhe|mae here is great, particularly tho&s;e of Pyrmont, Selt|zer and Spa, of which we &s;hall &s;peak hereafter.</P>
<P>The &s;eas of Germany are the Baltic and German ocean; and frequently the gulph of Venice is reckon|ed among&s;t the number. The ocean wa&s;hes but a &s;mall part of the German &s;hores, though Germany gives name to that &s;ea which flows between Great-Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway: but, as it lies to the North of Holland and Germany, it has al&s;o been called the North &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34">The Baltic lies between Denmark, Germany, Pru&s;|&s;ia, Courland, Ru&s;&s;ia, and Sweden. This &s;ea is not ob&s;erved to ebb or flow, but &s;eems to di&s;charge it&s;elf into the Sound, or the Swedi&s;h and Norwegian &s;ea.</P>
<P>The principle, navigable rivers of Germany, are, the Danube, which is ranked as the fir&s;t in Europe; it takes its ri&s;e in Swabia, and is augmented by a number of others, particularly the Drave, a large na|vigable river, which &s;eparates Hungary from Sclavo|nia, and falls into the Danube near E&s;&s;eck, and the Save, which pa&s;&s;es through mo&s;t of the cities of Scla|vonia and Servia, and di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Da|nube at Belgrade. The Tey&s;e ri&s;es in the Car|pathian mountains, and running &s;outhward through Hungary, falls into the Danube over again&s;t Salana|kenem.</P>
<P>The &s;wiftne&s;s of the current is very remarkable, for it renders the waters of the Danube muddy and of a whiti&s;h colour; in&s;omuch, that the clear &s;treams of &s;ome of the rivers which fall into it are plainly di&s;cernable af|ter a cour&s;e of &s;everal miles. And what is &s;till more remarkable is, that notwith&s;tanding the many large ri|vers which the Danube receives into it, it never is ob|&s;erved to ri&s;e higher than u&s;ual, though the banks of the le&s;&s;er rivers which fall into the Danube are often over-flowed.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35">This river has &s;o deep and &s;o wide a channel, that both the Imperiali&s;ts and Turks have had fleets of men of war on it, as well as many engagements, par|ticularly at the late &s;iege of Belgrade. The whole cour&s;e of this river from its &s;ource to the Euxine &s;ea, into which it di&s;charges it&s;elf by &s;ix or &s;even mouths, is computed to be about 1500 Engli&s;h miles; in its cour&s;e it wa&s;hes the walls of Rati&s;bon, Pa&s;&s;aw, Vienna, E&s;&s;eck, Belgrade, and contains &s;everal i&s;lands, of of no &s;mall extent.</P>
<P>There are three cataracts, or whirlpools in the cour&s;e of this famous river; the fir&s;t is called the Swines Snout, &s;o named from the craggy rock which hangs over the river near Lintz in Au&s;tria. This vor|tex is dangerous, as its draught is directed down|wards, &s;o that both &s;mall craft and large &s;hipping may alike be &s;ubject to danger and &s;ink, if too heavily laden.</P>
<P>When the river is high this whirlpool is &s;afe&s;t, for then the water runs off a great &s;pace above the rocks, but the &s;tream is at that time more violent and rapid, as it boils the &s;tronger, and its extent the larger. This danger too is at that time heightened by a counter current, which joins it to the right of what is called the Loch, which is a narrow pa&s;&s;age winding round the rocks, and at low water quite dry.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="36">The &s;econd fall is called the Thunderer; this cata|ract is near the town of Gran in Au&s;tria; and the third is a whirlpool about a furlong lower down. But how|ever terrible they have been repre&s;ented of old, yet, by modern experience, we find the pilots of the river wade this danger.</P>
<P>The next great river, is the Rhine, which receives its &s;ource in the country of the Gri&s;&s;ons in Switzer|land, and pa&s;&s;es by the cities of Stra&s;burg, Heidelberg, Cologn, Bonn, Du&s;&s;eldorf, and Cleve; thence through Holland and empties it&s;elf into the German ocean.</P>
<P>There are reckoned nine cataracts in this river; the fir&s;t of which are only con&s;idered as dangerous; one is a little below Schaffhuy&s;en in Swi&s;&s;erland, where the whole river falls from the top of a rock 75 feet high; the other is at Lauffenberg. The Rhine runs to the northward, between Swabia and Al&s;ace into the Palatinate, receiving in its way the Mayne.</P>
<P>The Elbe is a large river that ri&s;es in Sile&s;ia, runs northward into Saxony, to Hamburg, and thence di&s;|embogues it&s;elf into the German ocean. This is reckoned the deepe&s;t river of any in Germany, and navigable for large &s;hips up to Hamburgh, which is 70 miles from the &s;ea. Near Hamburg it joins many i&s;lands, and between the&s;e and the &s;ea is a very broad &s;tream.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37">The other principal rivers are the We&s;er, and Oder.</P>
<P>Of the lakes the principal is that of Con&s;tance, be|tween Suabia and Swi&s;&s;erland; that of Bavaria; the Cirkeritzer-&s;ee, in the duchy of Carniola; the &s;weet and &s;alt lake of Seeburg, in the country of Mansfield; the great Haaf in Pomerania; the lake of Mecklen|burg; and the Dammer-&s;ee of Diepholz.</P>
<P>Next to the lakes and waters, the caves and rocks are the chief natural curio&s;ities of Germany. Men|tion is made of a cave near Blackenberg in Hartz|fore&s;t, of which none have found out the end, though many have advanced 20 miles to it; but the mo&s;t re|markable curio&s;ity of this kind is near Hammelen, about thirty miles from Hanover, where, at the mouth of a cave, &s;tands a monument which commemorates the lo&s;s of 130 children, who were &s;wallowed up in 1284; though this fact is &s;trongly atte&s;ted, it has been di&s;puted by &s;ome. Frequent mention is made of two rocks near Blackenberg, exactly repre&s;enting two monks in their proper habits, and of many &s;tones which &s;eem to be petrifactions of fi&s;hes, hogs, trees, and leaves. We will now proceed to the polity of the country.</P>
<P>In former times there were neither towns in Ger|many, nor any places of &s;trength. Single hou&s;es, de|tached
<PB N="36" REF="38">
from others, were built in commodious places, generally &s;traw huts, &s;ometimes wa&s;hed over with a pure glo&s;&s;y earth. Places of &s;trength here are of more ancient date than the towns; the Romans having erected the fir&s;t ca&s;tles in Germany. In the time of the Frank emperors, Chri&s;tian churches and other buildings were erected here in the Gothic ta&s;te, and every mountain and eminence fortified with a ca&s;tle. The wars of the Huns cau&s;ed <HI>Henry</HI> I. to build towns and places of &s;trength, and from that period civil and military architecture in Germany, ro&s;e to great per|fection; &s;o that it may now boa&s;t of &s;ome thou&s;ands of boroughs and cities, many of which are very con&s;i|derable, large and fine, and al&s;o of important places of &s;trength, not to mention &s;ome thou&s;ands of vil|lages, and a great number of cloi&s;ters, ca&s;tles, and gentlemens &s;eats. The va&s;t Gothic palaces, cathe|drals, ca&s;tles, and above all, town-hou&s;es through|out Germany are very curious, they &s;trike the behold|er with an idea of rude magnificence, and &s;ometimes have an effect preferable to Grecian architecture.</P>
<P>The chief hou&s;es in great cities and villages, have the &s;ame appearance probably as they had 400 years ago, and their fortifications generally con&s;i&s;t of a brick wall, trenches filled with water, and ba&s;tions or half-moons.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="39">In the fir&s;t century after the birth of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> Ger|many was divided into &s;everal petty &s;tates, which had no common &s;upreme governor. After the di&s;&s;olution of the we&s;tern Roman Empire, &s;ix principal nations aro&s;e in it, the Swabians, Alemans, Franks, Fri&s;ians, Saxons, Thuringians, and Bavarians. The French reduced Gaul to their &s;ubjection, and conquered the other five nations above-mentioned, &s;o that under <HI>Charlemayne</HI> all Germany was united into one kingdom, though not independant; but as a part of the Frank monarchy. The conquered German nations had here|ditary dukes of their own at fir&s;t, and were governed by their own laws, but <HI>Charles,</HI> that is <HI>Charlemayne</HI> put an end to the former, and governed the countries by counts, and royal mi&s;&s;ionaries. The diets, how|ever, which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted of old, were &s;till retained. In the year 800, <HI>Charles</HI> al&s;o revived and confered the dignity of a Roman Emperor on him&s;elf and family. His &s;on <HI>Lewis</HI> divided the kingdom among his &s;ons, upon which the greate&s;t troubles en&s;ued, which in 843 were adju&s;ted, and <HI>Lewis</HI> the German obtained all Germany, quite to the Rhine, with the three towns of Spires, Worms, and Mentz, and thus Germany became an independant kingdom. In 94 the German <HI>Carolingian</HI> line, that is the de&s;cendants of <HI>Charlemayne</HI> became extinct. Germany was, at this time, a hereditary &s;tate, but the power of its kings was limited by the diets; yet it continued hereditary till 1224, when it was torn by inte&s;tine commotions.
<PB N="38" REF="40">
In 1273, however it began to recover from its di&s;|tracted &s;tate, and by a compromi&s;e of the electors, <HI>Palegrave Lewis</HI> was cho&s;en &s;upreme head, and from him has &s;prung the race of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>The empire is now elective, but the election &s;eems to be &s;ettled in the Au&s;trian family. During the life of the Emperor, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or is cho&s;en king of the Ro|mans by the nine electors, and on the death of the Emperor &s;ucceeds to the empire of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The revenue of the Emperor including all his terri|tories, Bohemia, Hungary, &amp;c. amounts to almo&s;t four millions and a half &s;terling.</P>
<P>Every new king of the Romans mu&s;t &s;olemnly re|nounce all attempts of rendering the empire heredi|tary to his heirs and followers; but it &s;eems I &s;ay, to be &s;ettled in the Au&s;trian family. The laws of the empire require no other qualifications in a candidate for the Roman crown, than to be <HI>Ju&s;tus, bonus et utilis,</HI> that is ju&s;t, good and u&s;eful, without any limitation of re|ligion, nation, &s;tate, or age. This choice is &s;ettled by the electors, and declared by the elector of Mentz, as &s;oon as conveniently can be done after the decea&s;e of the former emperor, by means of envoys and pub|lic re&s;cripts to the electors, which ceremony la&s;ts for three months, and is performed at Frankfort, on the Mayne.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41">The electors appear in per&s;on or by their envoys, who mu&s;t be inve&s;ted with unlimited power. After &s;ettling the deliberations, as well relative to the capitu|lation of election as other matters propounded by the e&s;tates, foreign envoys or others, and after all foreign|ers, who belong not to the retinue of the electors, or their envoys, have been ordered to depart the town before the day of creation, the election pro|ceeds; that is to &s;ay, all the electors, who are pre|&s;ent, with the fir&s;t envoys of &s;uch as are ab&s;ent, betake them&s;elves in their re&s;pective electoral habits, and in formal proce&s;&s;ion, on hor&s;e-back from the council-hou&s;e to the church of St. Bartholomew, where after ma&s;s they &s;olemnly promi&s;e before the altar, that they will elect the fitte&s;t per&s;on to be the emperor, and then they &s;hut them&s;elves up in the chapel of election.</P>
<P>When they have once bound them&s;elves by oath, to let a plurality of votes &s;tand good; the&s;e votes are collected by the elector of Mentz, according to the rank of the electors; after which the electors of Sax|ony a&s;k the elector of Mentz, for his own. Who|ever has more than half of the voices of the college for him is elected, and an elector may give his vote for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When the election is over, the per&s;on elected, or his plenipotentiary, or proxy, mu&s;t directly &s;wear and &s;ub&s;cribe to the capitulation of election, upon which
<PB N="40" REF="42">
he is congratulated, and the choice made public in the church.</P>
<P>If the elected king of the Romans, be not pre&s;ent in per&s;on, he mu&s;t yet give a peculiar counter bond for the maintenance of the capitulation of election, and before the coronation &s;wear to it him&s;elf, till which he cannot take upon him the government, but mu&s;t leave it to the vicars of the empire.</P>
<P>An authentic copy of the capitulation of election, &s;ub&s;cribed by the elected, or his envoy, and confirm|ed by the &s;eal of the former, is delivered to each of the electors; on the contrary, the electoral college, cau&s;es to be delivered to the elected an in&s;trument of election, and, when ab&s;ent, it is to be carried to him by a prince, with a writing of notification.</P>
<P>On this he appoints a day for his coronation, which according to the etiquette of the empire, ought to be held at the Imperial city of Aix la-Chapelle; but the cu&s;tom has been of late di&s;pen&s;ed with, and it is held in the town of election; and a counter bond is given to the city of Aix-la-Chapelle, and then the jewels of the empire are delivered up at the place of corona|tion, with great &s;tate and &s;olemn formality.</P>
<P>The &s;everal things delivered are, a rich crown and &s;ceptre, two Imperial rings, a book of the go&s;pel
<PB N="41" REF="43">
richly ornamented with diamonds and precious &s;tones, two broad &s;words, belts, ve&s;tments, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Then having the jewels of the empire carried before him in &s;tate, he goes in proce&s;&s;ion to the church, where he is al&s;o received by the &s;piritual electors: and at ma&s;s they pre&s;ent him with a book, when he takes the oath of a ruler, and, among other things, promi&s;es all due veneration to the Pope and the church. After which he is anointed &s;even times by either the elector of Mentz or Cologne, and then adorned with the ancient ve&s;tments and Imperial en&s;igns, and once more &s;worn. Upon which he dubbs &s;ome new knights; and &s;uffers him&s;elf to be admitted a canon of the Collegiate church of St. <HI>Mary's,</HI> at Aix la Chapelle, and is then conducted on foot in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion to the council-hou&s;e, to a table, at which the hereditary officers attend.</P>
<P>Of the nine electors there are three &s;piritual and &s;ix temporal; the three &s;piritual electors are tho&s;e of Mentz, Treves, and Cologne: the temporal are tho&s;e of Bohemia, Bavaria, Saxony, Brandenburg, Elector Palatine, and Hanover; next to the&s;e rank the princes of the empire, which are numerous. The title of the Emperor runs thus: <Q><HI>L.</HI> by the grace of God elected Roman Emperor, at all times augmenter of the em|pire, in or out of Germany, King.</Q> The arms of the empire are a black eagle with two heads, hovering with
<PB N="42" REF="44">
expanded wings in a field of gold, and on the head of this eagle the Imperial crown. To the&s;e the arms of the &s;everal hereditary countries are annexed.</P>
<P>The Emperor is con&s;idered by all &s;tates as the fir&s;t European potentate; being the &s;upreme of the Ger|man empire, he enjoys all manner of privileges; but is &s;ubject to the ancient laws of the empire. He has the right of be&s;towing dignities, creating honours, and e&s;tabli&s;hing privileges. He can &s;ecure a debtor again&s;t a creditor, give letters of protection again&s;t il|legal power, and can confer majority or minority, that is, give a minor power to enjoy his e&s;tates. He can render ba&s;tards legitimate, can confirm contracts and remit extorted oaths. In &s;hort, he can do many things which other princes cannot.</P>
<P>The e&s;tates of Germany are divided into eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal and temporal. The eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tates are either Catholic or Prote&s;tant, but the one has not more pri|vileges than the other: the temporal are electors, princes, counts, lords, and Imperial towns; but the&s;e are not &s;ubject to each other. They arrive to the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e e&s;tates by blood, con&s;ent of the Em|peror and empire, public treaties, inheritance, and compact of confraternity, and the &s;tates of the empire are obliged to marry conformable to their rank. With re&s;pect to leagues and wars of the empire, alienations, and mortgages of lands belonging to it, and all ca&s;es
<PB N="43" REF="45">
which concern its &s;ecurity and public &s;tate, the Empe|ror can do nothing without the con&s;ent of the electors, or at their de&s;ire. They may meet together in com|mon con&s;ultation, or hold what is called an electoral diet. A &s;ubject may be guilty of trea&s;on again&s;t them, and they rank as princes. The eccle&s;ia&s;tical are &s;tiled <HI>Electoral Grace;</HI> the temporal electors, <HI>Mo&s;t gracious Lords.</HI> They give precedence to kings; their envoys yield place to tho&s;e of crowned heads, and kings call them <HI>brothers.</HI></P>
<P>The diet of the empire is an a&s;&s;embly of the Empe|ror and all the &s;tates of the empire, or their envoys and plenipotentiaries. This diet is &s;ummoned by the Em|peror, who, in con&s;ultation with the electors, appoints the time and place. The fir&s;t diet of an emperor is to be held at Nuremberg. The pre&s;ent received its beginning at Rati&s;bon, in 1663, and has been conti|nued there, at &s;tated times, ever &s;ince. The Emperor either attends in per&s;on, or by a prince, his commi&s;|&s;ary, and the other electors, either per&s;onally or by their envoys, or charging the envoys of other &s;tates with their voice. The e&s;tates of the empire divide in their con&s;ultations into three colleges, namely, into the electoral and princely, the latter of which compre|hends the prelates, counts, and lords, and into the col|lege of the Imperial cities; and the bu&s;ine&s;s is con|ducted much in the manner of our parliaments.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46">The taxes of the empire are impo&s;ed by the diet only. Each &s;tate contributes its proportion to the maintenance of the Emperor and empire, and for &s;up|port of the army. But the Emperor cannot commence a war of the empire, without the con&s;ent of the diet, nor can he make any peace, but with their appro|bation.</P>
<P>The empire of Germany in the year 1552, was erected into ten circles, e&s;tabli&s;hed for its maintenance and promotion of its external peace, repelling ho&s;tile violence, and for the di&s;po&s;al of &s;uch things as tend to the common good: but all &s;tates and divi&s;ions of the empire are not comprized in the&s;e circles, for ex|ample, Bohemia, Moravia, the Lu&s;atias, and Sile&s;ias, the nobility of the empire, and in &s;ome circles, cer|tain counties and &s;eigniories are without &s;eat or voice at the diets of the&s;e circles.</P>
<P>The circles have each their &s;ummoning prince, who appoints the diet of &s;eparate circles, regulates the&s;e diets, receives all matters addre&s;&s;ed to them, commu|nicates them to other &s;tates, and executes the &s;entence of the &s;upreme courts of the empire pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t a &s;tate of their circle, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There are 73 &s;ie&s;s in Italy, belonging to the empire, among the&s;e are the duchies of Milan, Mantua, Mo|dena, Tu&s;cany, &amp;c. But the power of the Emperor
<PB N="45" REF="47">
in the&s;e &s;tates is incon&s;iderable, He promotes to dig|nities there, and grants immunities, and can put them under the ban of the empire; yet they are often re|fractory and &s;eldom pay their &s;tated taxes, in time of war, without compul&s;ion. After having given a ge|neral account of Germany, I mean to treat of it ac|cording to its &s;everal circles, when I &s;hall enter more minutely into matters that occur.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Character of the Germans, their Habits, Di&s;|po&s;itions, Manners, Cu&s;toms, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE de&s;cription of the cities and buildings will occupy their proper portions, when we come to &s;peak of the various circles of which this empire is compo&s;ed, particularly the court, and Imperial &s;eat, at Vienna.</P>
<P>A curious and ob&s;erving traveller mu&s;t &s;oon di&s;|tingui&s;h a very remarkable difference among the Germans in regard to temper, and mode of living,
<PB N="46" REF="48">
which is no &s;mall argument that they con&s;i&s;t of &s;eve|ral di&s;tinct nations; and the&s;e characters of di&s;tinct|ions will never fail to continue.</P>
<P>That &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for imitation, peculiar to the Germans, is often times, in many of them, a dange|rous infection, yet frequently produces beneficial and laudable effects. It is to their honour, that al|mo&s;t all the kingdoms in Europe owe to German blood their crowned heads.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants in Germany can only be determined by comparing it with other countries; being, in general, populous; and containing, at lea&s;t, a thou&s;and &s;quare miles more than France, which being e&s;timated at twenty millions, Germany mu&s;t fairly be allowed to contain 24 millions.</P>
<P>The ancient Germans, as well as the pre&s;ent race, were always con&s;idered as athletic and robu&s;t. Whe|ther the French nation is ju&s;tifiable or not in its charge, I cannot pretend to &s;ay, but they tax the whole German nation with &s;tupidity and want of &s;en&s;e; in&s;inuating that it is not po&s;&s;ible for the &s;oul to animate &s;o va&s;t a bulk with the &s;ame advantage it does one of an inferior &s;ize. The leaden temper of the Germans (&s;ays <HI>Voltaire</HI>) wants to be mended by mingling the French quick-&s;ilver with it. And cer|tainly it is true, that almo&s;t every people have &s;ome|thing
<PB N="47" REF="49">
in their tempers, as well as in their per&s;ons, to characterize them. The levity of the French, and the gravity of the Spaniard, are as much occa&s;ioned by the &s;ituation of their re&s;pective countries, as the different ta&s;tes of their wines. Animals of &s;uch and &s;uch a frame of mind and body, are as natural to &s;ome certain &s;oils, as the plants peculiar to the country.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the different tempers, and capacities, that are to be met with in the world, the heavie&s;t and mo&s;t intractable part of mankind are ca|pable of being wonderfully improved by education, and application to bu&s;ine&s;s. Nor is it the youth of the quicke&s;t parts that always makes the greate&s;t man. If one, whom nature has been more bountiful to, at fir&s;t, makes &s;wifter advances in his &s;tudies than u&s;ual, perhaps he wants the patience and diligence of others, who, by their unwearied application, at length may po&s;&s;ibly &s;urpa&s;s him.</P>
<P>Again, if one per&s;on wants a ready wit, it is fre|quently made up to him in good judgment. And, as it is with particular per&s;ons, &s;o I apprehend it to be with nations. If they are defective in one re&s;pect, it is made up to them in another. Heaven has not given us all the &s;ame endowments, but has, however, di&s;tributed the gifts of nature &s;o equally, that every one is &s;atisfied with his particular portion; and, per|haps, there are very few defects but may be &s;ur|mounted
<PB N="48" REF="50">
by diligence and application: not a Ger|man, but, if his genius was duly con&s;idered, and he was introduced into an employment &s;uitable to it, might make a figure in the world; of which we &s;hall be further convinced, when we come to &s;peak of their learning, their arts, and their &s;ciences.</P>
<P>The morals of the Germans al&s;o have been cen|&s;ured, for drunkenne&s;s is &s;aid to be a vice peculiar to the country; but whether they are more addicted to drinking than their northern neighbours, or, indeed, than the Engli&s;h at pre&s;ent, is very much que&s;tioned. Certain it is, they cannot exceed the Ru&s;&s;ians in di&s;|orders of this kind. Drinking &s;ocieties are common in Germany, much upon the &s;ame plan as in England. Vices equally culpable in both nations. According to the celebrated <HI>Melancthon,</HI> the Germans were guilty of eating, as well as drinking to exce&s;s, for he u&s;ed to &s;ay, "We Germans eat our&s;elves &s;ick, we eat our&s;elves into hell." It is no extraordinary thing for them to &s;it from twelve at noon to five in the evening at dinner; and from &s;even at night, to two or three in the morning.&mdash;But, query: are not we equal &s;laves to the vices of the table?</P>
<P>In the delicacies of the table the &s;nail-pie is not omitted, being a &s;ingular delicacy. There is &s;carce a nobleman's garden but has a &s;nail-hou&s;e in it, which
<PB N="49" REF="51">
furni&s;hes his table. In other re&s;pects they eat and drink as do the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The Germans, however, with all the vices and va|nities a&s;cribed to them, are allowed to be endowed with &s;ome very commendable virtues, particularly hone&s;ty and fairne&s;s in their dealings:&mdash;and are, for the mo&s;t part, free and open, and great enemies to flattery and di&s;&s;imulation in trade; yet are the greate&s;t dupes po&s;&s;ible in their etiquette on every &s;uppo&s;ed mode of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Ho&s;pitality is another good quality which the an|cient, as well as the pre&s;ent Germans, are allowed to have. If a traveller can obtain a pa&s;&s;port, he may travel all over the empire without a &s;hilling.&mdash;And, what is &s;till more to their credit, few countries in the world can boa&s;t of le&s;s robberies, murders, or acts of deception and fraud. There is no nation more in love with travelling than the Germans: we meet with them in all the courts of Europe; and if it &s;hould be admitted that their natural parts are not equal to their neighbours, the experience they gain abroad makes ample amends for what they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be natu|rally deficient in. But the misfortune is, their pa&s;&s;ion for travelling frequently ruins their e&s;tates, and im|poveri&s;hes their country: for a German nobleman will not be &s;een in a foreign court without an equi|page &s;uitable to his quality, and perhaps beyond it.</P>

<P><PB N="50" REF="56">The courage and bravery of the Germans mu&s;t al|ways be acknowledged.&mdash;And if the empire is ever conquered it mu&s;t be by Germans, as an elegant wri|ter expre&s;&s;es it; which implies, that it mu&s;t be either from the mercenary troops hired from thence, or by their own di&s;&s;entions. The &s;ingular peculiari|ties of this people &s;hall be treated of in their proper places, when we come to &s;peak of the different circles.</P>
<P>Hunting the wild boar is a fa&s;hionable &s;port among the Germans of quality; but there &s;eems to be but little riding in the ca&s;e; for the bea&s;t being found by the hunt&s;men &s;ome time before, is &s;urrounded by a large company, who with their guns, lances, &s;pears and dogs, di&s;patch the creature as &s;oon as they can, without &s;uffering him to run for his life.&mdash;Sometimes, indeed, a wild boar will break through the crowd, and it is well if he do not wound either man or hor&s;e with his tu&s;ks.&mdash;</P>
<P>Another diver&s;ion in winter is the riding through the &s;treets on the &s;now in &s;ledges, which are drawn by hor&s;es richly accoutred, and adorned with bells and feathers, &amp;c. The game which they chiefly de|light in is che&s;s&mdash; and is the grand entertainment of every polite circle; and may be &s;aid to be the amu&s;e|ment of every rank down to the lowe&s;t pea&s;ant.&mdash; The Germans, however, are well acquainted with all
<PB N="51" REF="57">
our modes of gaming, from none of which are they precluded, except the pernicious national folly of lot|teries: a mi&s;chievous mode of government-finance in this country, which in the memory of every one of our readers has de&s;troyed the lives and fortunes of many of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, both in this and the neighbouring kingdom.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the Learning, Language, Univer&s;ities, and Police of the pre&s;ent Germans.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are but very few who write and &s;peak the German language with purity and correct|ne&s;s; and even the very Grammarians them&s;elves are of different opinions, with re&s;pect to the rules and principles on which it is formed; a fate common to all living languages.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="58">The pre&s;ent language of the Germans is much cor|rupted by the introduction of Italian, French and La|tin words. There are al&s;o &s;everal dialects of the High Dutch or German; &s;o that the natives of di&s;tant parts of the empire can &s;carcely under&s;tand what is &s;aid by tho&s;e of the hither parts, &s;o great is the vanity to which this error leads.</P>
<P><HI>Bu&s;ching</HI> boa&s;ts, that the German language yields not, by any means, in elegance, &s;oftne&s;s and charms, to any one language what&s;oever. It mu&s;t, indeed, be acknowledged to be very flowery, copious and pa|thetic, for the works of Ge&s;ner, Wieland, and La|vator, have tho&s;e de&s;ireable elegancies in the highe&s;t perfection.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to learning, the Germans, at pre&s;ent, di&s;pute the palm with all other nations. Not only their natural vivacity and &s;trong itch of imitation, but al&s;o the variety of government in Germany, their mu|tual emulation, and the freedom prote&s;tants enjoy there of writing according to their own judgment, has procured the greate&s;t improvement of the &s;ciences among them: their itch for reading too, is become &s;o great and general, and particularly among&s;t the prote&s;tants, that it is deemed unbecoming the fair &s;ex, and per&s;ons of any rank, either not to read or to have read.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="59">Nor is there any place in the world where more books are written and printed than among the Ger|mans; and though this itch for writing gives ri&s;e to many ordinary and mean performances, yet have many important and weighty writings appeared, from time to time, in their publications.</P>
<P>It may be al&s;o &s;aid, that printing is encouraged to a fault in Germany; for every man of letters is an author; and therefore they multiply books without number, whether they have any thing new to entertain the world with or not: but it were to be wi&s;hed that a little more moderation were u&s;ed in publi&s;hing tho&s;e various &s;uppo&s;itions and di&s;putations which annually over&s;tock Frankfort and Leip&s;ic.</P>
<P>In Germany there are 36 univer&s;ities, viz. &s;even|teen prote&s;tant ones, as follow:</P>
<P N="1">1 Altorff. 2 Dui&s;burg. 3 Erlangen. 4 Franck|fort on the Oder. 5 Gie&s;&s;en. 6 Gottingen. 7 Griefswalde. 8 Hall. 9 Helm&s;tadt. 10 Jena. 11 Kiel. 12 Leip&s;ic. 13 Marburg. 14 Rinteln. 15 Ro&s;toch. 16 Tubingen. 17 Wirtemberg.</P>
<P>And 17 Roman Catholic ones, <HI>viz.</HI> 1 Bamberg. 2 Cologne. 3 Dillengen. 4 Freyberg. 5 Fulda. 6 Gratz. 7 Ingol&s;tadt. 8 In&s;pruch. 9 Louvain. 10 Mentz. 11 Olmutz. 12 Paderborn. 13 Prague. 14 Saltz|berg. 15 Treves. 16 Vienna. 17 Wurtzburg.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="60">And two other di&s;&s;enting ones, viz. 1 Erfurth. 2 Heidelberg.</P>
<P>The number of riding academies, colleges, gym|na&s;ia, paedagogies and Latin &s;chools, is here al&s;o very great. And there are likewi&s;e academies for &s;ciences and &s;ocieties of literature. viz.</P>
<P N="1">1 The Imperial Leopoldine academy of the naturae curio&s;i. 2 The Gottingen &s;ociety of &s;ciences. 3 The Erfurth academy of u&s;eful &s;ciences. 4 The Leip&s;ic &s;ociety of liberal arts. 5 The Dui&s;berg learned &s;o|ciety. And 6 The Latin &s;ociety of Jena.</P>
<P>The public libraries are: 1 Vienna. 2 Hanover. 3 Wolfenbuttel. 4 Gottingen. 5 Leip&s;ic. And 6 Weimar.</P>
<P>There is no &s;pecies or branch of learning which has not already been cultivated among the Germans, or which has not been carried by them to a greater per|fection. The theological &s;ciences are not more in|debted to any people than the Germans of the re|formed churches. They have written largely upon the Roman and canon laws. <HI>Sthal, Van Swieten, Storck, Hoffman</HI> and <HI>Haller,</HI> have contributed greatly to the improvement of phy&s;ic; <HI>Ruvinus</HI> and <HI>Dillenius</HI> of Botany; <HI>Hei&s;ter,</HI> of anatomy and &s;urgery: and <HI>New|man, Zimmerman, Pott,</HI> and <HI>Margraff,</HI> of chemi&s;try;
<PB N="55" REF="61">
but the late publication of <HI>Fourcroy</HI> &s;uperceeds even tho&s;e.</P>
<P>In a&s;tronomy <HI>Kepler</HI> de&s;ervedly obtained great re|putation; as did <HI>Puffendorf,</HI> for the Elements of the Laws of Nature and Nations. <HI>Leibnitz</HI> and <HI>Wolfius</HI> opened the way to philo&s;ophy; and <HI>Gott&s;ched,</HI> who was a great favorite of <HI>Frederick</HI> II. King of Pru&s;&s;ia, introduced a &s;tandard for compo&s;ition and the be&s;t grammar, with directions for &s;tudying the Belles Lettres.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;heim, Jeru&s;alem, Spalding, Zolliko&s;er,</HI> and others, have written &s;ermons on the model of our be&s;t En|gli&s;h authors, particularly <HI>Tillot&s;on, Sherlock,</HI> &amp;c. and who&s;e publications would do credit to any coun|try. The only error in compo&s;ition, which de&s;erves cen&s;ure, is their prolixity: but it &s;till remains a fault, that great numbers of the German prie&s;ts are too much addicted to vulgar language, and ab&s;urd opinions.</P>
<P>Some of the Engli&s;h periodical writings, &s;uch as the Spectator, Tatler, and Guardian, being tran&s;lated into the German language, excited great emulation among the writers of that country; and a number of periodical papers appeared of various merit. One of the fir&s;t and be&s;t was publi&s;hed at Hamburg under the title of <HI>"The Patriot;"</HI> in which Dr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> late
<PB N="56" REF="62">
bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, was concerned; he being, at that time, chaplain to the Briti&s;h factory at Hamburg, and a con&s;iderable ma&s;ter of the German language. Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Geliert,</HI> one of the mo&s;t elegant of the Ger|man authors, and one of the mo&s;t e&s;teemed, has greatly contributed to the improvement of their ta&s;te. His way of writing is particularly adapted to touch the heart, and to in&s;pire &s;entiments of morality and piety. His fables and narrations written in Ger|man ver&s;e; his letters and his moral romances, are &s;o much read in Germany, that even many of the ladies have them by heart.

<P>The &s;ons of Apollo, may be ranked with the poets, <HI>Haller</HI> (a phy&s;ician,) <HI>Hagedom, Uz, Cronegh, Le&s;&s;ing, Gleim, Ger&s;tenbuger, Klei&s;t, Klop&s;tock, Reuenler, Zacha|riac, Wieland,</HI> and <HI>Ge&s;ner.

<P>In works of literature relative to antiquity the names of <HI>Klag, Le&s;&s;ing</HI> and <HI>Winckleman,</HI> &s;tand forward.

<P>It is an unfavourable circum&s;tance for German li|terature that the French language &s;hould be &s;o fa&s;hion|able in the courts in&s;tead of the German, and that &s;o many of their Princes &s;hould give it &s;o decided a preference; but the Pru&s;&s;ian court has, within the la&s;t two years, fully adopted, and we &s;ay, re&s;tored the language.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="64">And with re&s;pect to the fine arts, the Germans have acquitted them&s;elves tolerably well. Germany has produced &s;ome good arti&s;ts in painting, &s;culpture, ar|chitecture and engraving, and claim to them&s;elves the origin of engraving, etching and metzotinto, and even claim the origin of printing, gun-powder, and great guns.

<P>In the ta&s;te of the Germans, as has been already ob&s;erved, they affect &s;plendor; for both men and women are fond of rich dre&s;&s;es, which in fa&s;hion are the &s;ame as in France and England; but the better &s;ort of men are exce&s;&s;ively fond of gold and &s;ilver lace, e&s;pecially if they are in the army. The ladies at the principal courts, differ little in their dre&s;s from the French and Engli&s;h, except their not being &s;o fond of paint as the former. At &s;ome courts they appear in rich furs, and all of them are loaded with jewels, if they can obtain them. The female part of the Burghers families, in many of the German towns, dre&s;s in a very different manner, and &s;ome of them inconceivably fanta&s;tic, but in this re&s;pect they are gradually reforming, and many of them make quite a different appearance in dre&s;s, from what they did 30 or 40 years ago.</P>
<P>As to the pea&s;antry and labourers, they dre&s;s as in other parts of Europe, according to their employ|ments, conveniency and circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The &s;toves in Germany are the &s;ame with tho&s;e already mentioned in the Northern nations, and are &s;ometimes made portable &s;o that the ladies carry them
<PB N="60" REF="66">
to church. In We&s;tphalia, and many other parts of Germany, they &s;leep between two feather-beds with &s;heets &s;titched to them, which by u&s;e becomes a very comfortable practice.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t unhappy part of the Germans are the needy, little petty princes, who &s;queeze them to keep up their own grandeur, but in general the circum|&s;tances of the common people are far preferable to tho&s;e of the French.</P>
<P>The Germans, in general, are thought to want ani|mation, and indeed indu&s;try, application, and per&s;e|verance are the great characteri&s;tics of the German nation, e&s;pecially the mechanical parts of it. Their works of art would be incredible were they not vi&s;ible, e&s;pecially in watch and clock-making, jewellery, and turnery. At the greate&s;t tables, though the gue&s;ts drink freely at dinner, yet the repa&s;t is fini&s;hed with coffee, after three or public toa&s;ts have been given. But no people have more fea&s;ting at marriages, funerals, and on birth-days.</P>
<P>All the &s;ons of noblemen inherit their father's titles, which greatly perplexes the heralds and genealogi&s;ts of the country. It is recorded by <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> that the German hu&s;bands are not &s;o complai&s;ant as tho&s;e of &s;ome other nations to their ladies, who are not entitled to any preheminence at the table, nor indeed do they &s;eem to
<PB N="61" REF="67">
affect it, being far from either ambition or loquacity, though they are &s;aid to be too fond of gaming.</P>
<P>Many of the German nobility having no hereditary e&s;tates, by the &s;ound of their titles ea&s;ily get admi&s;|&s;ion into the army of the Emperor, or of the neigh|bouring kingdoms. Their fondne&s;s for titles is at|tended with many inconveniences. Their princes think that the cultivation of their lands, though it might trebly pay their attention, of no con&s;equence; &s;uch is the error of pride!</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Religion.</HEAD>
<P>ALL Hi&s;torians agree that the ancient Germans were heathens, but yet they had more rational principles of religion than either Greeks or Romans. About the beginning of the &s;eventh century they re|ceived the chri&s;tian religion, by the mi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Killion,</HI> an Iri&s;h bi&s;hop. In the eight century this attempt was further improved, and under the &s;pecious name of pro|pagating the doctrines of the go&s;pel, the mi&s;&s;ionaries from Rome &s;ubjected the people to the Romi&s;h yoke.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="68">In the 16th century a reformation in religion took place, and the prote&s;tant faith was introduced; but as we profe&s;s not to write an eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, we &s;hall leave the manner how, and the means by, which it was effected, to be &s;earched for in other authors.</P>
<P>It is computed that the Calvini&s;ts gain ground of the Lutherans, in Germany, being &s;upported by di&s;|&s;enters of every per&s;ua&s;ion: but much the greater part of the Empire adhere to the Roman-catholic religion, however the doctrines of the reformation produce this effect, that many bi&s;hopricks have been converted into &s;ecular principalities, and a new form of church-government &s;et up in many places, in&s;tead of the epi&s;copal.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e bi&s;hops, who are &s;till of the Roman-catho|lick communion, exerci&s;e a greater authority in their dioce&s;es than any prelates in Europe. They are mo&s;t of them temporal princes, and have as ab&s;olute a domi|nion over their &s;ubjects, &s;piritual and temporal, as the &s;ecular electors have over the laity in their territories.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the three eccle&s;ia&s;tical electors, there were formerly five archbi&s;hops and thirty bi&s;hops who had voices in the diet of the empire; but the archbi&s;hops of Magdeburg, Bremen and Riga, with the bi&s;hoprics of Halver&s;tadt, Minden and Verden, have, &s;ince the reformation, turned into &s;ecular principalities. Tho&s;e
<PB N="63" REF="69">
of Metz, Toul, Verdun, Be&s;ancon and Stra&s;burg, have been cut off from the empire and united to France or Lorrain. Tho&s;e of Vale&s;ia, Lo&s;anna and Coire, have been aboli&s;hed by the Swi&s;s Can|tons; &s;o that, except the eccle&s;ia&s;tical electors, there is in the college of the princes of the empire only the archbi&s;hop of Saltzburg and &s;eventeen or eighteen bi&s;hops who have votes.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the bi&s;hoprics may be con&s;idered as a great di&s;advantage to the younger branches of great hou&s;es, who u&s;ed to get a princely maintainance on being preferred to them: whereas they enjoy now little more than an empty title, without any patrimonial e&s;tate or inheritance, and the court or army is their only refuge at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hopric of Lubeck is &s;till an eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferment, altho' in the hands of the Lutherans; and is in the gift of the dukes of Hol&s;tein and Sle&s;wick.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop of Saltzburg is the fir&s;t German prelate, being born legate of the &s;ee of Rome, and gives place to none but the electors in the public diets. The other popi&s;h bi&s;hops, who &s;till have a voice in the diets of the empire, are Bamberg, Wurtz|berg, Worms, Spire, Erich&s;tedt, Aug&s;burg, Con|&s;tance, Hilde&s;heim, Paderborn, Mun&s;ter, Pa&s;&s;au, Fri&s;ingen, Liege, Trent, Brix and Bazil. The late
<PB N="64" REF="70">
dukes of Hanover were al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Hildei&s;hem, but now it is in the dominion of the elector of Cologn. Vienna is al&s;o a bi&s;hopric, &s;ubject to the archbi&s;hop of Saltzburg.</P>
<P>By the authority of the council of Trent the &s;ole power of confering dignities and prelacies, is ve&s;ted in the pope, not only in Germany, but al&s;o in all chri&s;|tendom, where the Romi&s;h yoke is tolerated.</P>
<P>There are other eccle&s;ia&s;tical princes, be&s;ides bi&s;hops, who have voices in the diets of the empire, the fir&s;t of whom is the great ma&s;ter of the Teutonick order, the abbots of Fulda, Hir&s;esfield, Murback, Kempton, Corbray, Prum, Stabel, Ludos, the grand prior of Malta, the provo&s;ts of Elvang and Beresfoldaguden; the&s;e &s;it on lower benches than the bi&s;hops in the a&s;|&s;embly of the diet.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o 23 other prelates, and 14 abbe&s;&s;es, who are placed below the &s;ecular princes, but the&s;e have no voices in a full body any more than the counts. The abbe&s;&s;es &s;end their repre&s;entatives to the diets of the empire, being excu&s;ed a per&s;onal appear|ance upon account of their &s;ex.</P>
<P>The 23 inferior prelates have either the title of pro|vo&s;t, abbot, or bailiff, of &s;ome popular place, and the revenues annexed to their dignities are frequently &s;u|perior to tho&s;e of the princes.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="71">The prote&s;tants in the German empire, whether Lutherans or Calvini&s;ts, acknowledge the &s;upremacy of the prince in who&s;e dominions they re&s;ide, and he is appealed to in all ca&s;es, unanimou&s;ly, as &s;upreme judge in all &s;piritual ca&s;es as well as temporal cau&s;es: but the church-di&s;cipline of the Lutherans and Calvini&s;ts is very different. The Calvini&s;ts have neither bi&s;hops nor &s;uperintendants, whereas the Lutherans have their general and particular &s;uperintendants; the general &s;uperintendants an&s;wering to our archbi&s;hops, and the particular &s;uperintendants to our bi&s;hops; and in the dominions of every prince is held a con&s;i&s;tory, which an&s;wers to our convocation. This a&s;&s;embly has the power of degrading and puni&s;hing offenders, and of making rules or canons for the better government of the clergy.</P>
<P>The &s;uperintendants vi&s;it their dioce&s;es once a year, and make a &s;trict enquiry into the doctrine and man|ners of all the clergy under their care. There are &s;ome Lutheran princes that have the title of bi&s;hops, who are as ab&s;olute in their dioce&s;es, as &s;ecular mo|narchs in their temporal dominions, and have an un|limited command over both clergy and laity.</P>
<P>The countries or &s;tates of Germany where the Lu|theran opinions chiefly prevail, are tho&s;e of Saxony, Brandenburg, Brun&s;wic, Lunenburg, Hol&s;tein, Meck|lenburg, Wirtemberg, Darm&s;tadt, Domlach, Lawen|burg,
<PB N="66" REF="72">
and Ea&s;t Frie&s;land. But there are a great num|ber of Calvini&s;ts among them; which &s;ect, as I have ob&s;erved, &s;eems to gain ground of the Lutherans.</P>

<P>By this li&s;t, which is far from being exaggerated, it appears that the Emperor and the empire is the mo&s;t powerful government in Europe; and if the whole force was united and properly directed, Germany would have nothing to fear from any of its ambitious neighbours. But the different intere&s;ts pur&s;ued by the &s;everal princes of Germany, render the power of the Emperor of little con&s;equence, except with regard
<PB N="69" REF="75">
to his own forces, which are indeed very formidable. The army of the pre&s;ent Emperor is computed to amount to 200,000 men.</P>
<P>The eccle&s;ia&s;tical princes are as ab&s;olute as the tem|poral ones; the principal of whom are the archbi&s;hop of Saltzburg, the bi&s;hops of Liege, Mun&s;ter, Spire, Worms, Wurtzburg, Stra&s;burg, O&s;naburg, Bamberg, and Paderbon. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are other eccle|&s;ia&s;tical princes. Germany abounds with many ab|bots and abbe&s;&s;es who&s;e juri&s;dictions are likewi&s;e ab&s;o|lute, and &s;ome of them very con&s;iderable, and all of them are cho&s;en by their &s;everal chapters.</P>
<P>The chief of the &s;ecular princes are, the landgrave of He&s;&s;e, the dukes of Brun&s;wic, Wolfenbuttel, Wir|temburg, Mecklenburg, and Saxa-Gotha; the marqui&s;|&s;es of Baden and Culmbach with the princes of Na&s;&s;au, Anhalt, Fur&s;tenburg, and many others, who have all high titles and are &s;overeigns in their own dominions. The free cities are likewi&s;e &s;overeign &s;tates, tho&s;e which are Imperial or compo&s;e a part of the diet bear the Im|perial eagle in their arms; tho&s;e which are Han&s;e towns have &s;till greater privileges and immunities, but they &s;ub&s;i&s;t no longer as a political body.</P>

the German Ocean and the Baltic, entered into a mutual league with each other for the &s;ecurity and promotion of trade and navigation, and were there|fore called <HI>Han&s;e towns.</HI> Though the trade of the&s;e fell greatly to decay in the fifteenth century and the name of the league cea&s;ed in time, yet the trading towns of Hamburg, Lubeck and Bremen are &s;till &s;o called and have a league &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them, under the name of which they conclude treaties of commerce with foreign powers. Hamburg is the mo&s;t important town of trade in all Germany, and much re&s;orted to by the Engli&s;h and Dutch. The other principal towns of trade are, Francfort-on-the-Maine, Leip&s;ic, Nuremburg, Aug&s;burg, Vienna, Fiume, and Trie&s;te, which la&s;t is al&s;o a free port. At Embden is e&s;tabli&s;hed a new Ea&s;t India company.</P>
<P>Indeed with re&s;pect to commerce, Germany enjoys all kinds of advantages, for it not only borders on the German Ocean, the Baltic, and gulph of Venice, but is watered by many navigable rivers, and &s;eated in the heart of Europe, &s;o that it can commodiou&s;ly ex|port what it has to &s;pare, and import all it wants. For the promotion of inland trade, &s;o many land-carriages have been introduced, that the expence is very low. Each German &s;overeign has a privilege of e&s;tabli&s;hing manufactures, and prohibiting foreign merchandize, limiting exportation, and excluding the trade of fo|reigners, &amp;c. The goods exported from Germany
<PB N="71" REF="81">
into the neighbouring and remote countries are corn, tobacco, hor&s;es, lean cattle, butter, chee&s;e, honey, &s;yrup, wine, particularly Rheni&s;h and Mo&s;elle, linen, woollen-&s;tuffs, yarn, ribbands, &s;ilk, and cotton-&s;tuffs, Nuremberg wares, goats-&s;kins, wool, wood, particu|larly for &s;hip-building; iron plates and &s;toves, can|non-balls, bombs, grenadoes, tin-plates, &s;teel-work, copper, bra&s;s-wire, porcelaine, earthen-ware, mirrors, gla&s;&s;es, beer, Brun&s;wick-mum, tartar, &s;malt, Zaffer, Pru&s;&s;ian blue, hog's bri&s;tles, printers ink, and many other things.</P>
<P>The revenue or private income of the Emperor does not exceed &pound;.6000 Engli&s;h, which ari&s;es from a few incon&s;iderable fiefs in the Black Fore&s;t: but the magnificence of many of the German courts is &s;o great, that a &s;tranger would be induced to conceive very high ideas of the income of their princes; which is owing to the high price of money in that country, and con&s;equently the low price of provi&s;ions and ma|nufactures.</P>
<P>Few of the revenues or territories of the German princes are &s;o large, as to be a&s;&s;igned to viceroys, to be oppre&s;&s;ed and fleeced at plea&s;ure; nor are they en|tirely without redre&s;s when they &s;uffer any grievance; they may appeal to the general diet or great council of the empire for relief.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="82">The &s;ubjects of the petty princes are mo&s;t unhap|py, for as they affect the grandeur and &s;plendour of the mo&s;t powerful monarch, in the number and ap|pearance of their officers and dome&s;ticks, whether in their palaces, gardens, curio&s;ities, pictures, guards, bands of mu&s;ic, tables, dre&s;s, and furniture, they are obliged to &s;upport all this vain pomp and parade at the expence of their va&s;&s;als and dependants.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the burghers and pea&s;ants of Ger|many, the former in many places enjoy greater liber|ty or privileges; the latter al&s;o, in &s;ome &s;pots, for in|&s;tance, in Franconia, Suabia, and on the Rhine, are generally a free people, or perform only certain &s;er|vices to their &s;uperiors, and only pay taxes: whereas in Brandenburgh, Pomerania, Lu&s;atia, &amp;c. they may &s;trictly be denominated &s;laves, though in different degrees.</P>
<P>Were the many improvements which have been talk|ed of by the court of Vienna for the hereditary domi|nions, put into execution, it would, at the &s;ame time, much improve the revenue, and in a manner free the country of tho|&s;e evils which u&s;ually flow from increa&s;|ing the public income of a crown. But there is a di|latorine&s;s and a languor in every thing tran&s;acted at this court, even in its mo&s;t intricate concerns, that damp the &s;pirit of all improvement, &s;o that any ob|ject of this &s;ort, upon a moderate computation, will
<PB N="73" REF="83">
be talked of half a century before it is executed: this was the ca&s;e with the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the woollen ma|nufactory in Hungary, and with every thing el&s;e; &s;o that it is not thought that the Au&s;trian revenues, how|ever they would admit of it, will for a long time be put upon a better footing than they are, or have any other improvements than what re&s;ult from oppre&s;&s;ing the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people &s;till more; than which no mea&s;ure can give a greater &s;tab to all general, national improvements.</P>
<P>Had the king of Pru&s;&s;ia po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Au&s;trian do|minions in exchange for his own, we &s;hould have &s;een them make a very different appearance; he would have rai&s;ed much greater revenues, with far greater ea&s;e to the people, and would have thrown &s;uch a vigour into all the tran&s;actions, which the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Flanders and the Italian dominions would have introduced him to, that the importance of them would have &s;peedily appeared in a very different light from what they do at pre&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of Moravia, Au&s;trian Sile&s;ia and Lu&s;atia.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I begin to treat of the regular circles, I will &s;peak of tho&s;e places not included in them: the&s;e are Moravia, Au&s;trian Sile&s;ia and Lu|&s;atia.</P>
<P>Moravia is bounded, to the we&s;t, by Bohemia; to the north, by Glatz and Sile&s;ia; to the ea&s;t, by Si|le&s;ia and Hungary; and to the &s;outh, by Au&s;tria, being about 360 German &s;quare miles in extent. It is called Moravia from the river Morava. Towards Hungary, Bohemia and Sile&s;ia, it is partly environed by mountains, and partly by woods. Above one half of it is mountainous and woody; and many of the mountains are &s;o high, as to be almo&s;t de&s;olate. In the more open parts are many mora&s;&s;es, bogs and lakes, where the water is unwhole&s;ome; and in the mountainous regions the air is rough; and &s;o cold, that in many places, even in &s;ummer, the people are obliged to u&s;e &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ves. More corn, however, grows here than the inhabitants con&s;ume. It produces al&s;o plenty of hemp, flax, vegetables, fruit, and fine &s;affron. They dig both frankincen&s;e and myrrh out
<PB N="75" REF="85">
of the earth, and &s;ome places produce good wine, both white and red. Its wide fore&s;ts are favourable to bees, afford plenty of veni&s;on, wolves, bears and leopards. Quarries of marble, ba&s;tard diamonds, amethy&s;ts, and other minerals, are al&s;o found here, and their lakes and ponds yield variety of fi&s;h. The number of towns and villages are about 2550. The native language is a dialect of the Sclavonian, little differing from the Bohemian; but the German language is very common al&s;o.</P>
<P>The &s;tates of the country con&s;i&s;t of the clergy, lords, knights and burge&s;&s;es. That of the clergy, is formed of the bi&s;hop of Olmutz, and the eccle&s;ia&s;tics entitled to wear a mitre and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of e&s;tates; that of the lords, of the princes, curates and barons; that of the knights, of the re&s;t of the gentry; and that of the burge&s;&s;es, of &s;ome few particular towns. The diets are appointed by the regency, and held at Brunn.</P>
<P>Olmutz has a univer&s;ity; a learned &s;ociety is there e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the &s;ciences begin to flouri&s;h greatly. The religion of the whole country is Roman-catholic, and &s;ubject to the juri&s;diction of the bi&s;hop of Ol|mutz, who &s;tiles him&s;elf duke and prince of the holy Roman empire. In the commotions of the Hu&s;&s;ites in Bohemia, the Moravians bore a con&s;iderable part; and, in the end, divided from the Roman-Catholics,
<PB N="76" REF="86">
and called them&s;elves <HI>Moravian brethren;</HI> of the&s;e there are &s;till &s;ome de&s;cendants in the coun|try, who externally conform to the Romi&s;h church, but privately hold &s;eparate a&s;&s;emblies, and partly, as opportunity offers, fly to prote&s;tant countries. We have had them in England.</P>
<P>The chief commodities of this country are the cloth manufactures at Iglau and Trebitz, where are al&s;o &s;ome iron and gla&s;s works, and where they make paper, gunpowder, &amp;c. but their commerce is very trifling. Brunn, however, enjoys the principal part. Olmutz is the capital of the province; has a ca&s;tle of con&s;iderable &s;trength, &s;urrounded by the river Mo|rava; the town is well fortified, rich and popu|lous, and divided into the old and new. It con|tains 26 churches, five chapels, nine cloi&s;ters, &s;e|veral ho&s;pitals, and two &s;eminaries, be&s;ides the uni|ver&s;ity. It has been frequently be&s;ieged and da|maged by fires. In 1741 it was blocked up for &s;ome months by the Ru&s;&s;ians. Moravia contributes about one third to the exactions which Bohemia pays. Seven or eight regiments are generally quartered there.</P>
<P>Au&s;trian Sile&s;ia was once a part of Poland; but many German colonies having &s;ettled there in the 13th century, a &s;eparation of the country was then began, and afterwards effected and united to the
<PB N="77" REF="87">
crown of Bohemia; but, in 1740, <HI>Frederick</HI> II. king of Pru&s;&s;ia, claiming &s;everal duchies in it, marched an army into Sile&s;ia; a war broke out between him and the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and the king having con|quered all lower Sile&s;ia and part of Glatz, it was con|firmed to him by the treaty of Bre&s;lau and Dre&s;den in 1742 and 1745. Hence it is this part only of Si|le&s;ia that belongs to Au&s;tria as a Bohemian fief. We have de&s;cribed Ru&s;&s;ian Sile&s;ia, which &s;ufficiently de|picts that belonging to Au&s;tria. The territories of Au&s;trian Sile&s;ia are the principality of Te&s;chen; that part of the principality of Troppau, which lies to the &s;outh of the river Oppa, a part of the principality of Jagerndorf, and a part of that of Grotkau.</P>
<P>Lu&s;atia runs from north-we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t, bounded on the ea&s;t by Sile&s;ia, on the &s;outh by Bohemia, on the we&s;t by Mi&s;nia, and on the north by the marqui|&s;ate of Brandenburg, exclu&s;ive of that part of Bran|denburg which belongs to it, and which makes about 20 German &s;quare miles. This province is about 180 miles in extent.</P>
<P>Upper Lu&s;atia abounds more in mountains and hills; and enjoys a purer air than the Lower, on which are many bogs and moori&s;h parts, but has &s;ome fine woods. In the mountainous parts there is but little room for agriculture; and the heaths on the confines of Lower Lu&s;atia and tho&s;e of Sile&s;ia, con&s;i&s;t
<PB N="78" REF="88">
of a pure &s;oil, affording little el&s;e than fine hunting. But where there is hu&s;bandry, grain of all kind is cul|tivated, and flax; and throughout is found what is u&s;ually called manna. Garden-&s;tuff they have little; but they make wine, both white and red. A great quantity of cattle is here bred; and they have plenty of veni&s;on.</P>
<P>In Upper Lu&s;atia are &s;ix cities, 16 &s;maller ones, and four market-towns; but in the Lower, only four cities, two market ones and 13 county towns; the&s;e towns are almo&s;t wholly peopled with German inha|bitants; but in the villages we meet with &s;ome of the Wends, the ancient inhabitants of this country, who retain the Wendi&s;h dre&s;s and language. Each mar|qui&s;ate of Upper and Lower Lu&s;atia con&s;i&s;ts of two &s;tate, the country and towns. In Lu&s;atia are made all &s;orts of linen from unbleached and bleached yarn, common and fine, as al&s;o fine white dama&s;k, for table and bed-linen, and white tick. There are al&s;o in Lu&s;atia good manufactures of hats, leather, paper, gunpowder, iron and gla&s;s, and wax bleaching.</P>
<P>I cannot pa&s;s over the Wendes without acquainting my readers from <HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> of their gro&s;s &s;uper&s;tition. The characteri&s;tic of the inhabitants of all this country is &s;triking bigotry, united with manife&s;t &s;en&s;uality. You need only &s;ee what is going forwards here, to be convinced that the religion taught by the monks is as
<PB N="79" REF="89">
ruinous to the mind, as it is repugnant to chri&s;tianity. The cici&s;bios, or gallants, accompany the married women from their beds to the church, and lead them to the very confe&s;&s;ional. The pilgrimage to Mariazell, which is a watering-place, like Bath, is a ceremony half religious and half profane. A friend of mine &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> had the honour to accompany a lady who went there with her lover. As it was expected the next day, being the fea&s;t of the Virgin, there would be great crouds at confe&s;&s;ion, the lady was a&s;ked, whether it would not be better to expedite matters and confe&s;s the night before? 'No,' an|&s;wered &s;he, 'if I do, I &s;hall have to confe&s;s again to|morrow morning, before I can go to &s;acrament, with a pure con&s;cience.' Their lovers are chiefly officers and high churchmen, between which orders, on this account, there is a con&s;tant jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>The bigotry of the public in the&s;e parts, which from the mixture of gallantry with it, is to be found even among people of rank, degenerates among the common people into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t abo|minable buffoonery. The Wendes di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves by a &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;tom, that does little ho|nour to the human under&s;tanding, and would be in|credible, if we had not the mo&s;t unequivocal proofs of the fact before our eyes. Many years ago they &s;et out, with &s;ome Hungarian enthu&s;ia&s;ts, to Cologn on the Rhine, which is about 120 German miles, to
<PB N="80" REF="90">
cut off the head of a crucifix there. Every &s;even years this operation is performed, as in this time the beard is &s;uppo&s;ed to grow again to its former length. Rich per&s;ons of the a&s;&s;ociation &s;end the poorer ones as their deputies; and the magi&s;trates of Cologn receive them as amba&s;&s;adors from a foreign prince; they are entertained at the expence of the &s;tate, and a coun|&s;ellor &s;hews them the mo&s;t remarkable things in the town. I know not whether we ought to laugh mo&s;t at the remote town of Cologn, or at the&s;e poor pea|&s;ants; there is indeed &s;ome excu&s;e for the former, as the farce brings in large &s;ums of money at &s;tated times, and may therefore de&s;erve political encourage|ment; but &s;till it is the meane&s;t way of gain that can be imagined. The&s;e Wendes have alone the pri|vilege of &s;having our Saviour, and the beard grows only for them; they firmly believe, that if they did not do this &s;ervice to the crucifix, the earth would be &s;hut to them for the next &s;even years, and there would be no harve&s;ts. For this rea&s;on they are obliged to carry the hair home with them, as a proof of their having fulfilled their commi&s;&s;ion, the returns of which are di&s;tributed among the different communities and pre&s;erved as holy relicks. The Imperial court has long endeavoured to prevent this emigration, but in vain; when they could not go openly, they went clande&s;tinely; &s;o that the Court forbad the regency of Cologn to let them enter the town: this happened but a very few years back, &s;o that the numerous em|ba&s;&s;y

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the Circle of Au&s;tria.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Circle borders, to the north, on Mo|ravia, Bohemia, and the Circle of Bavaria; to the we&s;t, on Swi&s;&s;erland; to the &s;outh, on the terri|tory of the republic of Venice and the Adriatic &s;ea; to the ea&s;t, on Hungarian Illyria and Hungary. Tho&s;e territories which are called the hither Au|&s;trian countries, lie &s;cattered in and about Swabia.</P>
<P>Au&s;tria is reckoned among the circles that are en|tirely catholic. It is called from the arch-duchy of the &s;ame name, which con&s;titutes the principal part of the circle-country, whereof Vienna is the ca|pital.</P>
<P>The arch-duke, now Emperor of Germany, is the governing prince, director and &s;overeign of the whole
<PB N="82" REF="93">
circle. Diets for the circle are not u&s;ual in this country, the greate&s;t part of it &s;tanding under one &s;ingle lord, according to who&s;e good plea&s;ure the re&s;t of the &s;tates regulate them&s;elves. To the aids of the empire this circle contributes its &s;hare, as often as the public &s;ecurity requires it; which contribution u&s;u|ally amounts to a fifth part of the empire.</P>
<P>Lower Au&s;tria would breathe a very unwhole&s;ome air, was it not purified by very &s;trong gales; it is principally level, except the lofty mountain which commences about two hours, or two leagues (each league four miles) from Vienna, on the Danube, and extends for 50 miles.</P>
<P>The country is fertile, and yields &s;uch plenty of corn, that the inhabitants are able to di&s;pen&s;e with con&s;iderable quantities of it to their neighbours. The natural productions are very numerous, as here al|mo&s;t every native production of the empire is rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>Upper Au&s;tria is mountainous, particularly towards Stiria and Bohemia, in which countries &s;everal tracts al&s;o lie uncultivated. The &s;oil of Upper Au&s;tria, on account of its numerous water-&s;prings, is wet, and the air, all the year round, moi&s;t and cool; which latter property &s;eems to be owing to its &s;aline earth, and chiefly to the &s;ituation of the country; for as it lies on the &s;hady &s;ide of the mountains of Upper
<PB N="83" REF="94">
Stiria and Saltzburg, the warm &s;outherly and we&s;terly winds are thereby precluded acce&s;s.</P>
<P>Upper Au&s;tria, on account of the nature of its &s;oil and air, as ju&s;t de&s;cribed, is uncommonly fertile in mu&s;hrooms, and it is likewi&s;e for the very &s;ame rea&s;on, that the inhabitants plant a va&s;t number of fruit-trees. In corn it has not a &s;ufficiency; but that deficiency is &s;upplied by Lower Au&s;tria. The breed of cattle here is pretty good. They abound al&s;o in all &s;orts of game.</P>
<P>Near Munden is a con&s;iderable mine of &s;alt, out of which both the cry&s;tal and variegated &s;ort is dug, but the latter of the&s;e is little e&s;teemed. In the&s;e parts al&s;o fre&s;h water is conveyed into the &s;alt-works, or pits, which after it has impregnated it&s;elf with <HI>alcaline particles,</HI> is extracted by machines, and conducted through canals to the di&s;tance of four miles for boil|ing.</P>
<P>The rivers and lakes here yield many &s;orts of fi&s;h. There are al&s;o two medicinal baths in this country, one at Millack and di&s;trict of Mi&s;el, near the Da|nube; and the other at Kirch&s;lag, near the borders of Bohemia, and di&s;trict of Mackland.</P>
<P>In Lower Au&s;tria are fifteen royal towns, together with eighteen others belonging to particular lords, as
<PB N="84" REF="95">
al&s;o market-towns, and many common boroughs, foundations, and cloy&s;ters, which enjoy both &s;eat and voice with the country; as al&s;o &s;ome cloy&s;ters, cita|dels and noblemens &s;eats.</P>
<P>In Upper Au&s;tria are &s;even royal towns, together with five belonging to particular lords, 81 market towns, many common boroughs, 13 foundations and cloy&s;ters, which enjoy both &s;eat and voice with the country; two knights-commanderies, two colleges, one re&s;idence of je&s;uits, 17 other cloy&s;ters, and 217 citadels and noblemens &s;eats.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trian-German dialect, which differs greatly from the High-Dutch, is &s;poken from the Adriatic &s;ea, to the N.&mdash;N. W. and we&s;terly quite as far as Sile&s;ia, Saxony, Franconia, Suabia, and Swi&s;&s;erland. It al&s;o extends it&s;elf to the E. and S. through Hungary and the Sclavonian territories, yet there is an ob&s;ervable dif|ference in the pronunciation, and in a few particular words u&s;ed in certain parts of this large tract of country.</P>
<P>The &s;tates of this country con&s;i&s;t of four orders, viz. 1&s;t, Of the prelates, under which title are included bi&s;hops, abbots, and provo&s;ts. 2d. Of lords, under which cla&s;s are reckoned princes, counts, and ba|rons. 3d. Of the knights. 4th. Of the towns and markets.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="96">The nobility of this circle are numerous and power|ful, and divided into two ranks, one of counts, the other knights. The e&s;tates of the nobility are either allodial or feudal. The elector of Brandenburg pre|&s;ides by his deputies the margraves, over the fief court of Au&s;tria, which con&s;i&s;ts of the commi&s;&s;ary, the fief provo&s;t, and fief advocate. But the party aggrieved may appeal to the Au&s;trian government. And for the differences between lords and va&s;&s;als, a main court is generally appointed. This is al&s;o ob&s;erved by the archbi&s;hop of Saltzburg, together with the bi&s;hops of Bamberg, Pa&s;&s;au, Rati&s;bon, Frey&s;ingen, and others, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of va&s;&s;als in Au&s;tria, Stiria, and Ca|rinthia.</P>
<P>The &s;ciences here are in an improving condition. For the promotion of learning in this country have been e&s;tabli&s;hed the lower &s;chools and Gymna&s;ia, to|gether with the univer&s;ity of Vienna, which ever &s;ince the year 1752, has been put on a better footing, as al&s;o the There&s;ian college. The importation of fo|reign commodities is prohibited under great re&s;tric|tions. The exports of this circle are chiefly &s;affron, wine, allum, and gun-powder.</P>
<P>To the high privileges of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, be|longs an arch-ducal title, which no other prince in the world bears, and which in the year 1245, was rai&s;ed to the royal dignity. The arch-dukes are at liberty to
<PB N="86" REF="97">
appear, or not, at the diets of the empire, agreeably to their plea&s;ure. They are exempt from the taxes of the empire, yet are under the immediate protection of it.</P>
<P>The particular colleges for Lower and Upper Au&s;|tria, are the Imperial royal repre&s;entation and cham|ber, as al&s;o the government in matters of ju&s;tice, or the land government for Lower Au&s;tria at Vienna, with two colleges of the &s;ame nature at Lintz, for Upper Au&s;tria; the ju&s;tice-council in Lower and Upper Au&s;tria, together with the Imperial royal town and land judicatory.</P>
<P>The civil law is al&s;o in force in Au&s;tria; unle&s;s where the &s;overeign or the land u&s;age has prohibited it: as in both ca&s;es it has no precedence. To the revenues of the &s;overeign belong the collections and &s;ub&s;idies which the &s;tates grant.</P>
<P>Vienna is the principal city, and being the re&s;idence of the Emperor, is accounted the capital of all Ger|many. This city lies on a branch of the Danube; its &s;ituation is plea&s;ant, as the E. and N. country around it are entirely level; but to the W. and S. are &s;een an entire range of mountains, covered with trees and vines; the Danube here is wide, and divides it&s;elf into &s;everal arms, forming &s;o many i&s;lands, which are planted with wood.</P>

<P>There is a remarkable bridge at Vienna, called the High Bridge, made by cro&s;&s;ing the two &s;treets at right angles; but as the ground in one &s;treet is as high as the tops of the hou&s;es of the other, it was found nece&s;&s;ary to build a bridge in the lower &s;treet, to let the upper &s;treet pa&s;s over it; &s;o that the lower &s;treet pa&s;&s;es under the arch of this bridge.</P>
<P>The city of Vienna, independent of the &s;uburbs, is not very large, as a per&s;on may walk round the Gla|cis in an hour; it is well fortified, having a &s;trong rampart with 11 &s;tout ba&s;tions, 10 ravelins, very broad and deep ditches, with nece&s;&s;ary outworks. The number of the inhabitants from pretty exact computations, does not exceed 50,000; but the &s;ub|urbs, which all round exceed 5 or 600 paces from the fortification of the city take up a great deal of ground, which make the aggregate of the inhabitants to be about 500,000. The &s;treets are very narrow and winding, and the fronts of the hou&s;es are al&s;o very
<PB N="88" REF="100">
narrow and extremely high, &s;ome of them being eight &s;tories. The palaces of Vienna are indeed, for the mo&s;t part almo&s;t hid in narrow &s;treets; but in &s;plen|dor and magnificence they greatly &s;urpa&s;s the hotels of Paris; but more e&s;pecially if we take in the noble &s;tructures in the &s;uburbs.</P>
<P>Vienna however is a noble and &s;trong city, and the princes of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, have omitted nothing that could contribute to its grandeur and riches: it contains an excellent univer&s;ity, a bank, which is in the management of its own directors, or magi&s;tracy, and a court of commerce.</P>
<P>One of the &s;uburbs &s;tands on an i&s;land in the Da|nube, &s;o that the river runs through the town. The garri&s;on here con&s;i&s;ts of one regiment of foot. Out of the countries belonging to the Emperor lying on the Danube, and of cour&s;e out of Bohemia, Moravia, Hungary, Stiria, Tyrol, and Italy, all &s;orts of pro|vi&s;ions, together with nece&s;&s;ary and agreeable things are brought here. The prote&s;tants frequent the wor|&s;hip held in the hou&s;es of the prote&s;tant amba&s;&s;adors. In the city are all &s;orts of arti&s;ts, manufactures, and handicraftmen, &amp;c. The many high colleges and ju|dicatures, which have their &s;eat here, add to the cre|dit and vivacity of the place.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="101">Vienna certainly &s;tands upon much more ground than Paris, but it is not &s;o much built upon. No hou&s;es without the walls of Vienna are not allowed to be erected, nearer to the glacis, than 600 yards; &s;o that there is a circular field of 600 paces all round the town, which has a beautiful and &s;alutary effect. Be|yond this plain, the &s;uburbs are built, and there are &s;ix and twenty of them; thus they form a very ex|ten&s;ive and magnificent town of an irregularly cir|cular form, containing within its bo&s;om, a &s;pacious field; which has for its centre the Imperial town of Vienna, con&s;i&s;ting only of 1230 hou&s;es, and the&s;e very narrow.</P>
<P>The&s;e magnificent &s;uburbs, are not near &s;o populous as the town, becau&s;e many hou&s;es in the &s;uburbs have exten&s;ive gardens belonging to them; and many fa|milies who live, during the winter, within the fortifica|tions, pa&s;s the &s;ummer months in the &s;uburbs. <HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> &s;ays, there are three or four hundred &s;uch garderns; the air and water are much better here than at Paris, of cour&s;e the city is more whole&s;ome as a place of re|&s;idence.</P>
<P>There are &s;carce eight buildings in the whole city, which can be called beautiful or magni|ficent. The mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of the&s;e are the palace of Leich&s;ten&s;tein, the Emperor's library and the chancery. The Emperor's palace is an old black
<PB N="90" REF="102">
building, that has neither beauty nor &s;tateline&s;s. It is a great ma&s;s of &s;tone, which was built &s;even &s;tories high, in order to contain as many people as po&s;&s;ible. It con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal courts, &s;urrounded with irregular buildings; the apartments are neither &s;pacious, nor furni&s;hed equal to what one might expect at one of the mo&s;t expen&s;ive courts in Europe. Though there are 15 &s;quares or places, there are hardly three which make any figure. The greate&s;t thoroughfare is from the palace over the coal-market, the Graben, the Stirkamei&s;engla&s;s, and through the Carnthner&s;tra&s;&s;e. In either places the thoroughfare is as great, and the motion as lively as in any &s;treet of London or Paris. There are not more than eight buildings, worth look|ing at, in the &s;uburbs; and the ta&s;te of the build|ings, about the gardens and &s;ummer-hou&s;es, is mi|&s;erable. The &s;treets, which are about 80, are crooked and narrow; and, in the winter, are lighted with lanterns.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to enumerate the many palaces, two of which are Imperial, of this capital; its acade|mies and libraries, and, among others, the fine one of prince Eugene, with his and the Imperial cabinet of curio&s;ities hereafter de&s;cribed. Among its rich convents is one for the Scotch nation, built in honour of their countryman, St. Colman, the patron of Au|&s;tria; and one of the &s;ix gates of this city is called the
<PB N="91" REF="103">
Scotch gate, in remembrance of &s;ome noble exploits performed there by the troops of that nation.</P>
<P>After all that has been &s;aid of this magnificent city, the mo&s;t candid and &s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e who have vi|&s;ited it, are far from being lavi&s;h in its prai&s;e: the hou&s;es and furniture of the citizens are greatly di&s;|proportioned to the magnificence of the palaces, and other public buildings; but, above all, the exce&s;&s;ive impo&s;ts laid by the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, upon every commodity in its dominions, mu&s;t always keep the manufacturing part of their &s;ubjects poor.</P>
<P>The late emperor, <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> II. was &s;en&s;ible of the truths which were plain to all the world, but his pre|dece&s;&s;ors and their coun&s;ellors: he examined things with his own eyes, and de&s;cended from that haughti|ne&s;s of demeanour which rendered the Imperial court &s;o long di&s;agreeable, and indeed ridiculous to the re&s;t of Europe. In general, the condition of the Au&s;trian &s;ubjects has been greatly meliorated under his government.</P>
<P>What di&s;tingui&s;hes the people of this place from the Pari&s;ians, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> is a coar&s;e pride not to be de&s;cribed, an un&s;urmountable heavine&s;s and &s;tupidity, and an unaccountable propen&s;ity to guzzling; the ho&s;pitality of the table, about which great noi&s;e has been made, is only the effect of pride. It is the cu&s;|tom,
<PB N="92" REF="104">
when a man is fir&s;t introduced into a new hou&s;e, to &s;ix a day in every week for him to be a regular gue&s;t there, and are greatly offended if he forgets it. The middle rank of people have five or &s;ix di&s;hes at dinner, over which they &s;it, at lea&s;t, two hours, and have three or four &s;orts of wine.</P>
<P>At the be&s;t tables, of the &s;econd order, you com|monly meet a monk, but more commonly a player, who&s;e very refined air enlivens the whole company. The monk is generally &s;erved by the lady of the hou&s;e, with whom he coquets, and the player is &s;eated at the other end, and laughs at them, till the whole company breaks out into &s;houts of laughter, far above the capacity of common lungs or ears either to join in or to bear.</P>
<P>Nobody here makes remarks upon the mini&s;ter or the court; nor entertains his company with the news of the day. None here &s;peaks in public at the ex|pence of his neighbour; but the public places of re|&s;ort are all adapted to eating and drinking, in&s;tead of talking. They breakfa&s;t till they dine, and dine till they &s;up, with only the interval, perhaps, of a &s;hort walk, or going to the play.</P>
<P>If you go into a coffee-hou&s;e, of which there are about 70 at Vienna, or into a beer-hou&s;e, which are the mo&s;t elegant and be&s;t furni&s;hed of all the public

hou&s;es (I &s;aw one, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> with red dama&s;k ta|pe&s;try, pictures with gilt frames, looking-gla&s;&s;es, clocks, <HI>a la Grecque,</HI> and marble tables) you will &s;ee nothing but a perpetual motion of jaws. No one in the&s;e places talks, but to his neighbour, and that in a whi&s;per, &s;o that one would think they took one an|other for &s;pies.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the care that is taken by the Em|peror of the morals of his &s;ubjects, all the charities here depend on the court alone for &s;upport. I que&s;|tion, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> whether it would be po&s;&s;ible to get a collection of 10,000 guilders at Vienna. Though this place has &s;everal hou&s;es in it, with which the mo&s;t opulent in Paris cannot be compared; pride, gallantry and di&s;&s;ipation are all the feelings the people of Vi|enna are &s;u&s;ceptible of. Though mo&s;t of the riche&s;t people have been, for years, oppre&s;&s;ed with debts, they have not yet learned to confine their expences, and would think it a &s;hame to live within bounds. As to the middling orders, they live from hand to mouth, and are well &s;atisfied if, at the clo&s;e of the year, they can make both ends meet. Economy is a term un|known here; every man &s;wills and lives for the plea|&s;ure of &s;en&s;uality.</P>
<P>In &s;ome hou&s;es the ma&s;ters of which affect to live in the highe&s;t &s;tate, it is cu&s;tomary when an entertain|ment is given, to provide do&s;es of tartar emetic, and
<PB N="94" REF="106">
&s;et them in the adjoining room: here the gue&s;ts retire when they happen to be too full, empty them&s;elves, and return to the company again, as if nothing had happened, and this, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> is a characteri&s;tic of the country.</P>
<P>There are a great number of &s;inecure offices in the country, but many coun&s;ellors and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors have either nothing to do, or appoint deputies to do the duty for a very little money. The luxury in which the&s;e peo|ple live is beyond conception; <HI>his honour</HI> (for every pettifogging judge of the court of con&s;cience is &s;o &s;tiled) mu&s;t have his gentleman; and <HI>her honour,</HI> his wife, mu&s;t have her waiting lady, nor is it, as it is with us, where between the gentleman and the foot|man, there are no intermediate ranks; here there mu&s;t be a <HI>maitre a'hotel</HI> and a &s;ecretary, and as <HI>his ho|nour</HI> has great bu&s;ine&s;s every where but in his own court, he mu&s;t likewi&s;e have his coach. In a word there is not a court in Europe, except the Turki&s;h, which pays its officers of the &s;econd order &s;o well as this, and yet is &s;o ill &s;erved by them.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding many great princes at Vienna have va&s;t e&s;tates, they are mo&s;tly in debt. In mo&s;t coun|tries &s;ome one favourite luxury has the a&s;cendancy, but here they all reign, and are all carried to the utmo&s;t exce&s;s. Here are &s;everal &s;tables of 50, 60, or more hor&s;es; whoever has an e&s;tate of 50 or 60,000 florins,
<PB N="95" REF="107">
mu&s;t have from 24 to 30 hor&s;es, and it is a moderate e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts only of a <HI>maitre d'hotel,</HI> a &s;ecretary, a <HI>valet de chambre,</HI> two run|ning footmen, two hunt&s;men, two coachmen, five or &s;ix footmen, and a porter. The hou&s;es of <HI>Lichten&s;tein, E&s;terhazy, Schwartzenburg,</HI> and &s;ome others, keep 50 footmen, and the two former have a body-guard. A &s;ingle plate of fruit often co&s;ts from 60 to 70 florins; and Count <HI>Palm</HI> once appeared in a coat that had co&s;t him 90,000 guilders. (&pound;.3000 Engli&s;h) It is com|mon to give from 30 to 40,000 florins for a lady's dre&s;s, and though hazard is forbidden, there are &s;e|veral games at which you may lofe from 15 to 20,000 florins at a &s;itting.</P>
<P>The women of this place are hand&s;ome and well made, but have no colour, and their faces are not in|tere&s;ting. They are ea&s;y and lively in their motions, and al&s;o in their gait and their &s;peech. They are more compo&s;ed, more determined and more manly, than the French women, but not &s;o heroic as the Engli&s;h women. I cannot give you a better idea of them, than by telling you they are between the French and Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>A tinge of &s;uper&s;tition, peculiar to the women of this place, is united to great &s;en&s;ibility of heart, and rather tends to increa&s;e, than to repre&s;s love, friend|&s;hip and benevolence.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="108"><HI>Moore</HI> has made &s;ome good ob&s;ervations upon this &s;ubject; but nothing gives a better idea of it than &s;eeing a lady be&s;peak ma&s;&s;es in a convent, and give alms, with a wi&s;h that God may recover her &s;ick cici&s;beo.</P>
<P>The Cici&s;beat is upon the &s;ame footing here as in Italy; it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among the great as a mode that has been once e&s;tabli&s;hed; the poor take it up as a mat|ter of trade, and it is only among&s;t the merchants and manufacturers that jealou&s;y prevails: I &s;hall here pre&s;ent our readers with an anecdote from <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> which he vouches for, as being a fact.</P>
<P>A man of fa&s;hion having been rather too frequent in his vi&s;its to a rich trade&s;man's wife; the hu&s;band, who was di&s;plea&s;ed with the intercour&s;e, as every fond hu&s;band &s;hould, took the following method of putting a &s;top to it:&mdash;One morning, when he knew the loving couple were together, he ordered all his &s;ervants to be in waiting with flambeaux on the &s;tairs; he then &s;tept into the room, and told his excellency that his &s;ervants were come to light him home; the other was exceedingly &s;urprized, but affected not to under&s;tand him; upon which the merchant immedi|ately took him by the arm, and led him very cere|moniou&s;ly into the &s;treet, the &s;ervants holding the lighted flambeaux on every &s;ide, although it was about mid-day, which brought together a concour&s;e
<PB N="97" REF="109">
of people, to the great di&s;grace and confu&s;ion of the guilty nobleman, and the remedy took the de&s;ired effect.</P>
<P>In the &s;hort time I was there, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> I &s;aw more &s;plendid equipages and hor&s;es than there are in all Paris. French fa&s;hions prevail here univer&s;ally. Dre&s;&s;ed dolls are regularly &s;ent from Paris, for the purpo&s;e of teaching the women to put on their gowns and dre&s;s their heads: even the men get, from time to time, <HI>memoranda</HI> from Paris, and lay them before their taylors and hair-dre&s;&s;ers. All the women are painted up to the eyes and ears, as at Paris. The knowing ones tell you, that the eyes acquire a kind of fire by the&s;e means, which gives an inexpre&s;&s;ible animation to the whole look. Indeed, paint &s;eems a nece&s;&s;ary evil to hide the yellowne&s;s of their &s;kins. I &s;aw &s;everal of them, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> who had every rea&s;on to cry out, <HI>La verole, mon Di&eacute;u, m&aacute; roug&eacute; ju&s;qu'aux os.</HI></P>
<P>It is not here as at Paris, where there is an office in every part of the city, giving an account of what hou&s;es or lodgings are to let, and for what price. Here every owner of a hou&s;e puts up a bill before his door, &s;tating very circum&s;tantially what rooms he has empty.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="110">And as the hou&s;es con&s;i&s;t of five or &s;ix &s;tories, and each &s;tory has an owner, who may have a room or an apartment to let, you often find the doors plai&s;tered all over with bills; and may be near half an hour reading, before you get the information you wi&s;h. The fir&s;t room, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> who hunted for a lodg|ing, the fir&s;t room I &s;aw, was up four pair of &s;tairs; the looks of it did not di&s;plea&s;e me, but I di&s;liked the owner, and in&s;tantly trudged to another that was up &s;ix pair of &s;tairs; and when I got to the top, there came out of a lower apartment a little diminu|tive man in a night-gown: he had a pen behind his ear, and was followed by a maid, who gave him the appellation of <HI>your honour.</HI> Only your <HI>honour,</HI> thought I, may do: I &s;hould have been off at a higher title; I went into the room, and was half induced, by the pure air I breathed in the&s;e upper regions, to clo&s;e the agree|ment; but opening the window, and &s;eeing nothing but a pro&s;pect of roofs and chimnies, I altered my mind. I &s;aw &s;ix apartments that day without finding any thing that would &s;uit. Among other landlords we met with an <HI>excellence,</HI> rather a <HI>magnificence,</HI> (for, I had choice of titles) who lived in the back part of a ground floor, and with whom I did not choo&s;e to partake of the foul air he breathed. The next day's &s;ally opened with a <HI>gnadige frau,</HI> who recommended her <HI>fraeleii tochter</HI> to me for &s;o many things, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to think of coming to an agreement with her. 'Look here,' &s;ays &s;he, '<HI>my daughter, her|&s;elf,</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="111">
will bring you your coffee in the morning; if you choo&s;e tea in an afternoon, <HI>my daughter, her&s;elf,</HI> will attend you; if you choo&s;e to go now and then to the play, <HI>my daughter, her&s;elf,</HI> will accompany you,' and &s;o on. For it is not in Germany as at Paris; where a woman of character con&s;iders it as an affront to be of|fered to be treated to a public place, by one who is not a relation or a particular friend. Here it is the cu&s;tom to frank women, wherever you go with them, and I &s;oon &s;aw that the pretty girl's &s;ervices were in|cluded in the price of the lodging; &s;o off I was again, and tired my&s;elf another day with &s;earching for what I could not find, namely, an apartment to my liking. The be&s;t hou&s;es in the town are very dear, becau&s;e the &s;econd &s;tory of every &s;uch hou&s;e is allotted for the re&s;idence of the imperial court officers. From &s;ix, to eight guilders a month, is paid for one of the be&s;t rooms in a good &s;treet, and three, for one of the wor&s;t. Tho&s;e who lodge in the &s;uburbs can|not &s;tir out in &s;ummer without being choaked with du&s;t. Vienna lies open to the drying ea&s;t and north winds; but is protected, by its neighbouring hills, from the &s;outh and we&s;t. When it has rained here a whole night, all is dry again a few hours after &s;un|ri&s;e; and, by noon, the clouds of du&s;t begin to ri&s;e. Indeed, when it rains more than a day, the du&s;t is all mud, and very deep. Tho&s;e who cro&s;s from the &s;ub|urbs to the citadel, mu&s;t pa&s;s over the naked plain that parts them, and put his handkerchief in his
<PB N="100" REF="112">
mouth, that it may not be filled with du&s;t. The hackney coaches of this place are always on a trot or gallop; and it requires care, in &s;ome &s;treets, to pa&s;s through the clouds of du&s;t, without being run over by a coach, or running again&s;t &s;ome traveller.</P>
<P>Many families in this city live by letting their hou&s;es; there are &s;everal habitations, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> worth from two to 300,000 guilders, or from 20 to 30,000l. a year, which con&s;titutes the whole fortune of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. Any man out of debt, and who has a hou&s;e in this city, is accounted a rich man. The hou&s;e of the book&s;eller, Trattnem, is an object of 30,000 guilders, or 3000l. a year to him. The hou&s;es at Paris are more magnificent than tho&s;e at Vienna; but, owing to the walls and gates before them, they make but little appearance.</P>
<P>Among the eccle&s;ia&s;tical buildings at Vienna, the principal is St. Stephen's church, a Gothic &s;tructure, adorned with many pieces of &s;culpture, and the roof of which is covered with glazed tiles of various co|lours. If the tower of Stra&s;burg is looked upon as the mo&s;t curious, and that of Land&s;hutter to be the fine&s;t in Europe, St. Stephen's tower is unque&s;tionably the &s;tronge&s;t; which, as well as the church, is built with large &s;quare blocks of free-&s;tone, fa&s;tened together with iron braces. The height of this tower is 74 fa|thoms, three feet and a half, it was fini&s;hed in
<PB N="101" REF="113">
1400, and contains a bell, according to Dr. <HI>Kuchel|becker,</HI> above 10 feet high and 32 in circumference, which, without the clapper, weighs 1328 lb. the whole weight of the bell, iron-work, &amp;c. amounts to 25 tons and 1400 lb. The church is &s;o very dark that, even at noon; a di&s;tinct view of its &s;everal objects cannot be had. It has a &s;uperb marble tomb of the emperor <HI>Frederick</HI> III. which is &s;aid to have co&s;t 30,000 ducats.</P>
<P>Of late years, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> if any woman enters St. Stephen's church, or any other large church at Vienna, in a French &s;ack, &s;he is immediately ordered to withdraw. It was grown a cu&s;tom among the la|dies at Vienna, in the morning, to &s;lip on a &s;ack with|out &s;tays, or hardly any other covering; and, in that garb, hurry away to ma&s;s, which indecent cu&s;tom occa&s;ioned this Imperial prohibition. The clergy, from the pulpit, have given vent to their zeal again&s;t &s;uch loo&s;e dre&s;&s;es in very bitter terms. One, with great warmth, exclaimed, "that the women came to church in &s;acks, not to repent, as believers of old u&s;ed to do in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes; but the better to expo&s;e their wares to &s;ale; &s;o that no prie&s;t in admi|ni&s;tering the &s;acrament could, with a &s;afe con&s;cience, look at them." Another indecently threatened, 'that if he ever &s;aw a lady with her neck uncovered, he would &s;pit down her bo&s;om.' A little before the wearing of &s;acks in churches was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, three
<PB N="102" REF="114">
ladies, with bare necks and dre&s;&s;ed in the above|mentioned robe, pre&s;ented them&s;elves for the com|munion, among other per&s;ons round the altar; but the prie&s;t pa&s;&s;ed by them, as if he had overlooked them.</P>
<P>In that part of the &s;uburbs called Wieden, their late Imperial maje&s;ties began to build a mo&s;t magni|ficent church, in pur&s;uance of a vow made in the time of the pe&s;tilence, but it will be many years in fini&s;h|ing. Without the city, near the court, the empre&s;s dowager, <HI>Wilhelmina Amelia,</HI> has built a nunnery for ladies. The&s;e nuns ob&s;erve the rule of St. <HI>Franc&egrave;s de Sales;</HI> and, among other vows, engage them&s;elves to educate and in&s;truct young ladies of noble families; and on account of the illu&s;trious founder, it is ac|counted a very great honour for a young lady to be admitted into this convent for a few years. On the large area called the Hoff, oppo&s;ite to the noviciate college, &s;tands a bra&s;s pillar erected by the emperor <HI>Leopold,</HI> in 1667. On this pillar is a ma&s;terly figure of the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> and the gilding, though expo&s;ed to all the injuries of the weather, &s;till retains its lu&s;tre. This &s;ame emperor, in 1693, erected another pil|lar to the Holy Trinity, in the moat called by that name; it co&s;t 300,000 guilders; and is an ad|mirable piece of architecture, built with &s;tone, 66 feet in height.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="115">Formerly it was u&s;ual for people, by way of amu&s;e|ment, to &s;it round the&s;e pillars, which often produced many plea&s;ing incidents; but a company, among which were &s;everal counte&s;&s;es, having, by way of di|ver&s;ion, given too much to the &s;oldier on guard, at the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>'s pillar, &s;uch a di&s;turbance en&s;ued as cau&s;ed the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies to be forbidden; at pre&s;ent, people only kneel round them; but, in the evening, the re&s;ort does not &s;o much proceed from devotion, as from appointments of a&s;&s;ignation.</P>
<P>But of all the buildings at Vienna, the palace of prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> in the &s;uburbs, is undoubtedly the fine&s;t. It has a &s;uite of eleven rooms in a direct line, in the front and the towers at the angles, and another of &s;even rooms in the wings. In the room adjoining the prince's bedchamber are &s;everal exqui&s;ite pieces of painting in little; and in the next apartment is a lu&s;tre of rock cry&s;tal, valued at 20,000 guilders; here is al&s;o a Dutch painting, which co&s;t 13,000 guilders, repre&s;enting an old woman on her death-bed, with her daughter on her knees, taking leave of her, whil&s;t her maid is &s;tirring a medicine in a &s;poon, and the phy&s;i|cian looking into the urinal. Among the excellent paintings in the other apartments are a piece repre|&s;enting Adam and Eve, as large as life, &s;aid to have co&s;t 50,000 guilders; a woman embracing a youth in a bath, valued at 30,000, with Endymion and
<PB N="104" REF="116">
Diana, worth 12,000 guilders; a guilder is 2s. 4d. &s;terling.</P>
<P>The gardens lie in a &s;lope, and are very well adapt|ted for the elegant water-works there exhibited. In one part, called Paradi&s;e, is a &s;pacious aviary made of curious wire-work, with beautiful walks and gilt &s;ummer-hou&s;es; al&s;o a fine orangery, where &s;ome of the trees remain out all winter, with a cover only over the tops of them. The &s;pecies of uncommon herbs growing here are computed at 2000. In this palace is al&s;o a fine menagerie. There is another palace with|in the city, in which Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> re&s;ided in winter, a &s;uperb building magnificently furni&s;hed, with very ex|pen&s;ive articles and co&s;tly pictures. Here is a chimney-piece of grey marble that co&s;t 20,000 guilders, and a cry&s;tal lu&s;tre that co&s;t 10,000. In this palace is a fine library, con&s;i&s;ting of 14,000 volumes, mo&s;tly folios, gilt, lettered, and bound in red Turkey, and a fine collection of engraved portraits, con&s;i&s;ting of 48 vo|lumes of illu&s;trious per&s;ons in France, 61 volumes of tho&s;e in Germany, ten of the United Provinces, nine of the Spani&s;h Netherlands, &amp;c. two of Lorrain, 13 of Great-Britain, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Lichten&s;tern</HI> has three palaces in Vienna, with fine paintings and great curio&s;ities. The great &s;tairca&s;e in one of the&s;e palaces con&s;i&s;ts of two flights, and every &s;tep being a &s;ingle block of red
<PB N="105" REF="117">
marble, &s;even common paces long, co&s;t 60 guilders. In the two flights are 108 &s;teps. In &s;hort, Italy which is famed for magnificent &s;tructures affords very few equal to this: the walks, parterres, water-works, and &s;tatues, make the garden a mo&s;t delightful place, and it commands a fine pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>Clo&s;e by Prince <HI>Eugene's</HI> gardens in the &s;uburbs, is the Prince of <HI>Schwartzenburgh's</HI> palace, celebrated for its gardens. The &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s of this edifice eclip&s;es the Favorita, or Imperial palace that &s;tands near it. The place was built by the late Prince of <HI>Fondi,</HI> and co&s;t 300,000 guilders, but his heirs after his decea&s;e &s;old it to Prince <HI>Schwartzenburgh</HI> for 50,000 dollars, who expended on it 300,000 dollars more. This la&s;t owner was killed in hunting in the year 1732. The &s;aloons, &s;tair-ca&s;es, marble tables, looking-gla&s;&s;es, porcelain va&s;es, paintings, beds, and other rich fur|niture, make this one of the fine&s;t palaces in or near Vienna. The trees in the large orangery &s;tand here al&s;o in the open ground, but are &s;heltered in winter by a little &s;hed placed over them, and which can oc|ca&s;ionally be warmed. The walks, groves, and water-works, are extremely beautiful; the la&s;t are &s;upplied by a hydraulic machine, worked by fire, which co&s;t near 20,000 guilders, and throws up in 24 hours into a large re&s;ervoir above, 11,880 hog&s;heads of water. The honour of this invention is due to the Engli&s;h, and is &s;uch as are u&s;ed in &s;ome coal-mines in Scotland

for draining them. It is &s;uch a one as is u&s;ed at York Buildings, London, to &s;upply that part of the town with water.</P>
<P>On the red tower here hangs the flitch of bacon, (though at pre&s;ent made of rind) which, according to the common &s;tory, may be claimed by that extraor|dinary per&s;on who can prove that he ab&s;olutely rules his wife.</P>
<P>Every court in Germany produces a &s;ort of petit mu&s;eum, or cabinet of curio&s;ities, artificial and natu|ral, ancient and modern. The Imperial library at Vienna is a great literary rarity, on account of its an|cient MSS. It contains upwards of 80,000 volumes, among which are many valuable MSS. in Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Turki&s;h, Armenian, Coptic, and Chine&s;e; but the antiquity of &s;ome of them is que&s;|tionable, particularly a new te&s;tament in Greek, &s;aid to be written 1500 years ago in gold letters, upon purple. Here are likewi&s;e many thou&s;and Greek, Roman, and Gothic coins and medals; with a va&s;t collection of other curio&s;ities in art and na|ture.</P>
<P>It is very lofty, and adorned with good paintings in fre&s;co, &s;culpture, and a &s;uperb gallery, &s;o that it has the appearance of a temple. The importance of
<PB N="107" REF="119">
its manu&s;cripts may be &s;een in <HI>Lambecci</HI>'s Bibliothe|ca Vindobonen&s;is, publi&s;hed in 10 vols. folio, as al&s;o in <HI>Ne&s;&s;elius's</HI> catalogue. They are &s;aid to be above 10,000 in number. Among the Greek MSS, is a very ancient Dio&s;corides, written in a large character on vellum, with the herbs painted in their natural co|lours. In truth, this library is inferior to none but the Vatican at Rome, and that of the King of France; the&s;e may exceed it as to manu&s;cripts, but not in printed volumes, which are far above 100,000. Here are likewi&s;e a Greek tran&s;lation of Gene&s;is, &s;uppo&s;ed to be above 1200 years old, illu&s;trated with near 50 hi&s;to|rical paintings, <HI>Ptolomy's</HI> Geography finely written, and <HI>Nicephorus's</HI> Eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory; the only Greek MS. from which all the editions of that author have been publi&s;hed. Among the Latin MSS. is a Livy, which is of great antiquity, being written in capitals, and without points: but tho&s;e decads which are want|ing in the other copies are al&s;o mi&s;&s;ing here. Here is al&s;o a vellum MS. of the golden Bull, illuminated with many golden letters. It is written in the year 1400, by order of the emperor <HI>Wince&s;laus.</HI></P>
<P>On the fir&s;t page, and in the fir&s;t letter, which hap|pens to be a W, the initial of the emperor's name, he is repre&s;ented as being in pri&s;on at Prague, bound with hand-cuffs, and his feet confined in the &s;tocks. Near him is a repre&s;entation of his maid &s;ervant <HI>Su|&s;anna,</HI> by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he made his e&s;cape. Here

<P>The collection of medals in this library con&s;i&s;ts of no le&s;s than 16,000 ancient and modern. Here is al&s;o &s;hewn a tooth weighing &s;everal pounds, which is pretended to have belonged to a giant, but in reality is one of the <HI>dentes molares</HI> of a whale.</P>
<P>The model of the quick-&s;ilver mines at Idra, will be viewed with great plea&s;ure by the lovers of mechanics.</P>
<P>At the end of the library, is a particular cabinet ap|pointed for antient, Roman in&s;criptions and monu|ments; and a con&s;iderable collection is to be &s;een by the curious in&s;pector.</P>
<P>The expence of this library annually including the &s;alary of officers and &s;ervants belonging to it, is about 12,000 guldens, or 400l. Briti&s;h money.</P>
<P>The library is open every day; the Emperor's chief librarian is always the fir&s;t phy&s;ician, who ap|points two &s;ub-librarians. The attention paid to fo|reigners who vi&s;it this royal collection is both plea&s;|ing and flattering, as true politene&s;s is &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved.</P>

<P>One of the mo&s;t remarkable curio&s;ities in this mu|&s;eum is a large bowl of agate, three &s;pans in diame|ter, in the middle of which are the&s;e characters, &s;aid to be delineated by nature.

<Q>To Chri&s;t the Saviour of the world, the King eter|nal, the crucified Triune.</Q></P>
<P>The three cro&s;&s;es, and particularly the la&s;t, are &s;omewhat ob&s;cure; and no &s;mall &s;trength of imagina|tion is required to make them &s;ignify Tri-uno cruci|fixo.</P>
<P>This bowl is &s;aid to be a <HI>Fidei Commi&s;&s;um,</HI> or feoff|ment of tru&s;t, brought hither as part of the inheritance of the hou&s;e of Burgundy.</P>

In the mean time I apprehend, that the above-mentioned agate bowl will be of no more weight towards the conviction of anti-trinitarians, than the natural repre&s;entation of Apollo and the mu&s;es on an agate in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of King <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> in convincing the ancients of the divinity of tho&s;e imaginary per&s;ons.</P>

<P>The artifices which pretenders in alchymy generally make u&s;e of to blind tho&s;e whom they have once drawn in, are too numerous to be related.</P>
<P>It is &s;urpri&s;ing, that in our enlightened age, &s;uch impo&s;tors &s;hould meet with any dupes to impo&s;e on, &s;ince the hi&s;tory of former ages have detected &s;o many palpable frauds practi&s;ed by them. The projectors at

<P>To the curious reader, the proce&s;s of our own in|genious countryman mu&s;t be very &s;atisfactory; it was as follows:</P>
<P>He melted together one part of fine gold, and two of &s;ilver, which he beat into thin leaves, and cut into very &s;mall pieces; and then he made a very &s;trong powder of crocus martis, which he mixed with cor|ro&s;ive &s;ulphur, &s;alts, and pulverized pumice-&s;tone; and incoporating them with the prepared metal; he burnt the ma&s;s in an inten&s;e fire, repeating the pro|ce&s;s three times. At la&s;t, he &s;eparated the &s;ilver from it with aqua-fortis, and produced &s;ome gold, which &s;tood the te&s;t both of the aqua-fortis, and the cup|pel.

<P>But to return to our &s;ubject. Among the pictures in this mu&s;eum, is that of Cupid &s;craping and poli&s;h|ing his bow, &s;aid to be an original by <HI>Corregio,</HI> and is valued at 18,000 ducats.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o &s;everal other fine paintings; but the pic|ture-gallery and Imperial chamber of curio&s;ities particu|larly de&s;erve a traveller's notice. In the anti-chamber, are two portraits, with this in&s;cription in High Dutch: <Q>Janos Rovin, aged a hundred and &s;eventy-two, and Sarah his wife, aged a hundred and &s;ixty-four years, both of the Greek communion; they lived together in wedlock and hundred and forty-&s;even years.

<P>Among the many pieces in the gallery, the follow|ing are the mo&s;t remarkable, viz.

<P>Among the diver&s;ions of the Imperial court, tho&s;e of the carnival are not the lea&s;t, though the &s;trictne&s;s of the ceremonial checks the liberty and freedom al|lowed at other courts in the carnival ma&s;querades. No ladies but tho&s;e who have acce&s;s to the empre&s;s's chamber are admitted at court on the&s;e occa&s;ions. The Emperor generally dances &s;everal times with the empre&s;s and archduche&s;&s;es; but the empre&s;s dances with the Emperor only. In country dances their Im|perial maje&s;ties are &s;pectators only, but the archdu|che&s;&s;es mingle with the company. Some months be|fore the carnival, lots are drawn; and, from that time, the gallant is obliged to wait upon the lady, his part|ner, every day with a no&s;egay of natural or artificial flowers, with ribbands and &s;uch little pre&s;ents. The cavalier is likewi&s;e to provide his lady's dre&s;s; &s;o that the whole expence to him is &s;eldom le&s;s than 3000 guilders.

<P>The opera at Vienna is carried on at the expence of the Emperor; and, on certain gala days, co&s;ts him a con&s;iderable deal of money; for the magnificence of the theatre, the &s;plendor of the decorations, the rich|ne&s;s of the habits, and the performance in the or|che&s;tra, &s;urpa&s;s any thing of the kind in Europe. The band of mu&s;ic for the Imperial chapel and the pa|lace con&s;i&s;ts of above 120 per&s;ons; and &s;tands the Em|peror, at lea&s;t, in 200,000 guilders a year; tho' &s;everal of the female vocal performers have a &s;alary of 6000 guilders (200l.) yet it is a &s;aying among the Italians, that Vienna is the ho&s;pital of the <HI>virtuo&s;e</HI> in &s;ingers, and that they never go there till they are worn out.</P>
<P>The players al&s;o are in the pay of the court; money is taken at the doors, and whatever the receipts are, if they exceed the expences, the ballance is divided among them according to their talents. The highe&s;t &s;alary is about 180l. Engli&s;h, per year, and the lowe&s;t, 40l. The whole expences amount to about 8000l. a year, and the receipts to 12,000l. The author of a new piece is (be&s;ides a premium) entitled to a third part of what his work produces, and he may &s;ell the copy. The cabals and intrigues, however, of the players, a foreigner can have no conception of. Every new part makes a new quarrel, in which the
<PB N="115" REF="127">
courtiers take part, and the public &s;uffers accord|ingly. The public indeed, at Vienna, have a very bad ta&s;te. Every thing here cries out <HI>panem &amp; cir|cen&s;es,</HI> and the multitude &s;eem to have here no other wi&s;hes than to fill their paunches, and have a thea|trical entertainment by way of de&s;ert. Be&s;ides the national theatre, &s;ix or &s;even &s;trolling companies oc|cupy the &s;uburbs; the&s;e are &s;uch as Suabia is ac|cu&s;tomed to; the actors con&s;i&s;t of taylors, barbers, apprentices and ruined &s;tudents, who are &s;ometimes on the &s;tage, &s;ometimes in the ho&s;pital, and &s;ome|times in the army. The&s;e gentlemen play by a half light, favourable to intrigue. Of the&s;e, they &s;ucceed be&s;t who have their booths in a garden, where a man may walk with his friend between the acts. They are con&s;cious that the public does not come to &s;ee the play, that half the company is commonly at the ale|hou&s;e, whil&s;t the piece is going on, and one man acts three or four parts.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;ights is the company of the lemonade booths in the &s;ummer evenings. They erect a large tent in &s;ome of the public parts of the town, and round it are &s;everal hundred &s;tools occu|pied by the ladies and gentlemen of the place. At &s;ome di&s;tance there is a band of mu&s;ic; the wonder|ful mu&s;ic, the fe&s;tive dance, the &s;ilence and the fami|liarity which night diffu&s;es over every thing, have all of them an un&s;peakable good effect.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="128">To &s;ee the equipages of Vienna, you mu&s;t go to a fire|work, on the Prater, in the &s;ummer time. This Pra|ter is a wood of oaks and beaches on an i&s;land of the Danube, near the city. Towards the entrance, un|der the trees, there are about 30 tents, furni&s;hed with chairs and tables, in which you meet with all kind of refre&s;hments. This place is con&s;tantly re&s;orted to by day, but, to &s;ee it in its &s;plendor, you mu&s;t go to a fire-work: at this time about 12,000 people a&s;&s;emble and take their &s;upper under the trees. Towards the beginning of the night, on a &s;ignal given, they flock to the meadow, &s;urrounded with high trees, in which the &s;pectacle is exhibited. Directly oppo&s;ite to the firework is a magnificent amphitheatre filled with &s;e|veral hundred ladies, who&s;e high painted cheeks, rich jewels, and light &s;ummer-cloths, have a delightful effect. The pit, between the amphitheatre and the fire-work, is filled with men, as full as it can hold. At the conclu&s;ion of the fe&s;tival a mo&s;t extraordinary &s;ight takes place, a row of from 12 to 1400 coaches, phaetons, and other four-wheeled carriages, goes from the wood to the city, in &s;o direct and clo&s;e a line, that when they &s;top, the ham of the hinder carriages are clo&s;e upon the che&s;t of the fore, ones, the con&s;equence of which is, that, as they go in full trot or gallop, many of the carriages are liable to be broken, and the people in them expo&s;ed to the utmo&s;t danger; mo&s;t of the&s;e are gentlemen's coaches, with four or &s;ix hor&s;es; the number of them at Vienna is at lea&s;t
<PB N="117" REF="129">
3,500; there are about 500 hackney coaches, and about 300 job coaches. Notwith&s;tanding the num|ber of equipages on this occa&s;ion, there is hardly ever the lea&s;t di&s;order, the foot pa&s;&s;engers have their road, which no coachman dares break in upon; the bridge between the &s;uburb of Leopold and the Prater, in which the pre&s;&s;ure is the &s;tronge&s;t, is divided into four parts; the two outermo&s;t of them are for the foot pa&s;&s;engers, and the innermo&s;t for the coaches, that is, one for tho&s;e going, and another for tho&s;e coming. This order is kept up through the wood and on the <HI>Chau&s;e&eacute;</HI> in the &s;uburb, till you come to the city, and &s;ome cuira&s;&s;iers ride to and fro with drawn &s;abres, to &s;ee that the order is ob&s;erved. There is no in&s;tance of an accident having happened at the time of a fe&s;tivity; all the ca&s;ualties that take place through the neglect of coachmen, happen in the daily bu&s;ine&s;s of the city.</P>

<P>The <HI>Augarten</HI> is likewi&s;e one of their &s;ummer amu&s;e|ments, at which you may meet with all the great world. This is a large park in the &s;ame i&s;land of the Danube in which the Prater is. It is a park of the late emperor's, who, as an in&s;cription on the door &s;tates, fir&s;t opened it, as a friend to mankind, for a place of relaxation to all ranks; it is however vi&s;ited only by the higher orders; tho&s;e who &s;ee it is not made for them voluntarily exclude them&s;elves. It is a true Engli&s;h garden, and the Danube wa&s;hing its banks gives life to the whole. But the mo&s;t plea&s;ing per&s;pective is that of a large fore&s;t in view at a di&s;|tance, which has been cut through on the other &s;ide of the river, and is bounded by the remote hills of Moravia, which flit about it like light clouds. There is a magnificent pavilion, in which is a billiard table, and refre&s;hments of all kinds. Here all ranks, parti|cularly the noble&s;&s;e and literati, mix together. Spa waters are brought from Spa, Pyrmont, &amp;c. The la|dies drink, that they may &s;hew them&s;elves in neglige&eacute;s, and the men drink, becau&s;e the ladies are not &s;o &s;tiff in neglige&eacute;s, as when they are full dre&s;&s;ed.</P>

The middling people cannot go to church in the afternoon without taking a turn round the ramparts, which takes them up an hour; tho&s;e of higher ranks walk out to &s;hew their dogs, which, in this place only, are &s;afe from hor&s;es and carriages. Hounds are a great article of luxury here; the great endeavour to outvie each other in them; at pre&s;ent the little Pomeranian breed is all the mode, one either &s;now white, or coal black, with a &s;harp &s;nout, will fetch from 10 to 15 ducats: Prince <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> gave 25 ducats for one.

<P>They have al&s;o their winter amu&s;ements, as I &s;hall mention pre&s;ently.

The u&s;ual que&s;tions, parti|cularly of the ladies, with regard to a &s;tranger, intro|duced by any of their acquaintance into an a&s;&s;embly, turn upon the&s;e three capital points, viz. 1. Whe|ther he be of old nobility? 2. Whether he be rich? and 3. Whether he be fond of play? If the&s;e three que&s;tions are an&s;wered in the affirmative, no further enquiry is to be apprehended. Sometimes if a &s;tran|ger gambles deep, that qualification makes up any

deficiency in birth or fortune: this vice being as pernicious in Germany as in any part of England. Vienna &s;warms with what they call new nobility, i. e. per&s;ons who have acquired fortunes by trade, and then a&s;&s;ume what titles they plea&s;e. It al&s;o &s;warms with literati; when a man acco&s;ts you, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> whom you do not know, by his dirty hands, to be a painter, a &s;mith, or a &s;hoe-maker; or, by his livery, to be a footman; or, by his fine clothes, to be a man of con&s;equence; be a&s;&s;ured he is either a man of let|ters, or a taylor, for between the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es I have not learned to di&s;tingui&s;h. Indeed the title of a man of letters is now &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed at Vienna, that &s;uch of high rank as cultivate knowledge for them|&s;elves, or employ their talents in the &s;ervice of their country would be a&s;hamed of it. The principal men of merit here are foreigners: <HI>Stork</HI> is a Suabian; <HI>Denis,</HI> the great Au&s;trian poet, a Bavarian, and <HI>Hill,</HI> the mathematician, a Sile&s;ian. Many of the higher po&s;ts of the &s;tate are filled by natives; the Emperor's confidential &s;ecretaries are foreigners: nay, what is more, all the new enterpri&s;es have been al&s;o &s;et on foot by foreigners, who have been poorly rewarded. The inventor of the penny po&s;t was obliged to run away for debt: a French officer who was called in to improve the artillery was driven away by ingratitude, and an Engli&s;hman, who taught the art of gelding hor&s;es &s;afely, being paid only by fair promi&s;es, &s;hot him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="133">Mu&s;ic is the only thing for which the nobility &s;hew a ta&s;te; &s;everal of them have private bands of mu&s;i|cians, and all the public concerts atte&s;t that this fine&s;t of arts is here in the greate&s;t e&s;teem.

There are about 400 mu&s;icians here, who divide them&s;elves into particular &s;ocieties, and often labour together during a long cour&s;e of years. On a particular day of the year they have a general concert for the benefit of mu&s;icians widows, and I have been a&s;&s;ured, that the 400 play together as di&s;tinctly, as clearly, and as ju&s;tly, as when there are only twenty or thirty.</P>
<P>The Kalteburgh, which lies on the Danube, about three miles from the city, is a delightful place of re|&s;ort:
<PB N="122" REF="134">
the way to it is through a wonderfully well culti|vated country. At &s;ome di&s;tance to the left, on the &s;lope of a hill, and under &s;ome very old oaks, is Field-mar&s;hal <HI>Lacy</HI>'s elegant villa, with his Engli&s;h garden. By degrees you gain a thick fore&s;t on the brow of the hill; at the top of this &s;tands the Camal|deuleu&s;e convent in the fine&s;t point of view you can imagine. Under &s;ome trees before the convent, are a table and &s;ome benches, where the ladies, who can|not vi&s;it the in&s;ide of the mona&s;tery, without &s;pecial leave of the Archbi&s;hop, are entertained till their friends return. Each monk has his own &s;eparate hut, with a little garden belonging to it. To the outer cells there is a terrace, which looks over a perpendi|cular precipice into the Danube, and commands a pro&s;pect of which a monk of this &s;ort is quite unwor|thy. You have the whole city of Vienna like a ground-plot under your feet; you think you hear the con&s;tant hum in it, and your eye carries you over this part of Au&s;tria, as far as to the borders of Hungary and Moravia. The maje&s;tic Danube winds its way thro' an immen&s;e plain; at &s;ome di&s;tance it con&s;iderably widens, and, not being varied with woods and ele|vations, ca&s;ts a &s;ilver appearance on the land&s;cape to the right: the wood-crowned hill you are upon gradually decrea&s;es to the &s;uburbs, whil&s;t, to the left, it &s;tretches its high neck along the Danube; where at three miles di&s;tance, we &s;ee the golden hill of En&s;erdorf, which produces one of the be&s;t Au&s;trian

The numberle&s;s fine valleys, the blue hills &s;wimming on the horizon, and all the various a&s;pects of wood and water, diffu&s;e a delight which impre&s;&s;ed me to &s;uch a degree, that I could not help exclaim|ing with enthu&s;ia&s;m to the monk who was near me, <Q>Happy mu&s;t be that brother, who inhabits the outer cell!</Q> "No," returned he, <Q>we are not of your opinion; none of us chu&s;e to live in it; it is too much expo&s;ed to the winds, and is as cold again as any other.</Q> In a moment the man brought me out of my enthu&s;ia&s;m, and convinced me, I am one of tho&s;e who, in &s;ummer, never think of winter, and who hate nothing more than to be forced to &s;ee the ugly &s;ide of things, be they as natural as they may, whil&s;t I am taken up with the beautiful ones.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Moore</HI> tells us, that he, with the Duke of Hamilton, went up to this convent in a party to din|ner; when they got to the foot of the hill or moun|tain, as the common carriages could not be drawn up, they found chai&s;es of a particular con&s;truction calculated for &s;uch expeditions; the&s;e had been or|dered by the amba&s;&s;ador for the accommodation of the company. The table for dinner was covered in a field near the convent, under the &s;hade of &s;ome trees. Every delicacy of the &s;ea&s;on was &s;erved up; a very beautiful and &s;prightly lady did the honours, &s;ome of the fine&s;t women of Vienna, her companions,
<PB N="124" REF="136">
were of the party; &s;o the whole entertainment was conducted with equal ta&s;te and gaiety.</P>
<P>During the de&s;ert, &s;ome of the fathers came and pre&s;ented the company with ba&s;kets of fruit and &s;al|lad from their garden. The amba&s;&s;ador invited them to &s;it, and the ladies pledged them in Tokay. A permi&s;&s;ion had been obtained for the ladies to enter the convent; and they did, with the company, as &s;oon as dinner was over.</P>
<P>You would readily believe that the appearance of &s;o many hand&s;ome women would be particularly in|tere&s;ting to a community which had never before be|held a female within their walls. This was &s;ufficiently evident in &s;pite of the gravity and mortified looks of the fathers.</P>
<P>One lady, of a gay di&s;po&s;ition, laid hold of a little &s;courge, which hung at one of the father's belts, and de&s;ired he would make her a pre&s;ent of it, for &s;he wi&s;hed to u&s;e it when &s;he returned home; having, as &s;he &s;aid, been a great &s;inner; the father, with great gallantry, begged &s;he would &s;pare her own fair &s;kin, a&s;&s;uring her that he would give him&s;elf a hearty flog|ging, on her account, that very evening; and, to prove how much he was in earne&s;t, fell directly on his knees, and began to whip his own &s;houlders with great earne&s;tne&s;s, declaring that when the ladies
<PB N="125" REF="137">
&s;hould retire he would lay it, with the &s;ame violence, on his naked body; for he was determined &s;he &s;hould be as free from &s;in, as &s;he was on the day of her birth.</P>
<P>This melted the lady's heart; &s;he begged the fa|ther might take no more of her faults upon his &s;houl|ders; the lady a&s;&s;ured him that her &s;lips had been very venial, and that &s;he was convinced what he had done already, would clear her as completely as if he &s;hould whip him&s;elf to the bone.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Moore,</HI> &s;o ludicrous in all this, that you may naturally &s;u&s;pect the repre|&s;entations here given to proceed from inventions, ra|ther than memory. I a&s;&s;ure you, however, continues he, in downright earne&s;t, that the &s;cene pa&s;&s;ed as nearly as de&s;cribed; and, to prevent the mi&s;chief, I put the &s;courge, which the zealous father had made u&s;e of, into my pocket.</P>
<P>On my return to Vienna, I called at the counte&s;s of <HI>Wal&s;tein's,</HI> where the late emperor, <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> II. was on a vi&s;it. Some one had mentioned to him the pious gallantry of the father. He a&s;ked for a &s;ight of the whip, which he was told I had brought away; I had it in my pocket, and immediately &s;hewed it to him. He laughed very heartily at the warmth of the father's zeal, which he &s;uppo&s;ed had been augmented by the amba&s;&s;ador's tokay.</P>

A young man was &s;um|moned before the con&s;i&s;tory to make an&s;wer to a young woman, who claimed him for a hu&s;band. As he was in the outward chamber waiting for her, he &s;aw another poor young woman who was come there on the like errand. Having made him&s;elf acquainted with all the circum&s;tances of her ca&s;e, and finding that the &s;uppo&s;ed father of her child was fled, he of|fered
<PB N="135" REF="149">
her a good &s;um if &s;he would take him in his &s;tead, and date her complaint prior to the time of that which he expected to be brought again&s;t him. She agreed to his propo&s;al, and he went to the judges full of confidence in the &s;ucce&s;s of his project. The court put the u&s;ual que&s;tion, whether he had criminal inter|cour&s;e with the female before the bar? He confe&s;&s;ed he had; upon which he was told to give his hand to the woman. To this he replied, he had no objection, but that there was a per&s;on in the anti-chamber, who had prior claims upon him. Upon her being called, it appeared vi&s;ibly &s;he was farther gone than the other. The fir&s;t plaintiff was re&s;trained, and &s;atisfied with a little money. After &s;he was gone, the judges de&s;ired he would give his hand to the other, whereupon he pleaded the artifice, but having no witne&s;&s;es to pro|duce in evidence, he was compelled to give his hand to a woman he had not known above half an hour.</P>
<P>The&s;e marriages by compul&s;ion are attended with very pernicious con&s;equences both to &s;ociety and the &s;tate. And if it prevents the evil complained of, it is equally certain it mu&s;t increa&s;e adultery. Truth, con|fidence and love, the mo&s;t holy and u&s;eful bands of &s;ociety, they entirely di&s;&s;olve. The man who from the circum&s;tance of his having been compelled to marry, con&s;iders his wife as a pro&s;titute, con&s;equently cannot &s;o re&s;pect her, as to make the yoke of matrimony &s;it light and ea&s;y. It is indeed a&s;toni&s;hing how indiffer|ent
<PB N="136" REF="150">
the married people of this place are to each other. In Paris their indifference ari&s;es from the national manners, but here from nece&s;&s;ity, and by the force of compul&s;ory laws. It is no doubt owing to this want of the affections of &s;ocial and dome&s;tic life, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;|bec,</HI> that the people have here &s;o few moral feelings.</P>
<P>It is always allowed, every thing has its good as well as weak &s;ide. From this analogy we may de|duce, that the people here, want &s;pirit; con&s;equently their vices are few, and as weak as their virtues. Nothing of the tragedies of London, Paris or Naples, is &s;een here. For the choler of two &s;tout men extends only to menace and grinning: blows being &s;carce|ly ever made u&s;e of to decide the conte&s;t; le&s;t any of the &s;ix hundred &s;pies which creep round the me|tropolis &s;hould, <HI>&s;ans ceremonie,</HI> put the combatants in|to &s;afe ward.

<P>We &s;eldom hear of any extraordinary in&s;tances of impropriety and indecency in this place. Con&s;ider|ing the &s;tate of the country, it is not extraordinary that a ta&s;te for plea&s;ure &s;hould be &s;o prevalent as it is. it having certainly more food here than any where el&s;e. The number of poor is much &s;maller than at Paris, and probably than at London. Every thing, even the cloathing of the lowe&s;t &s;ervants, be&s;peaks a degree of affluence. The prodigality of the higher
<PB N="137" REF="151">
nobility, the many and great appointments paid by the court, and the exten&s;ive commerce of the mid|ling cla&s;&s;es, greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ts the circulation of money. The expence of living here is likewi&s;e le&s;s than it is any where el&s;e, and Vienna is probably the only town in which the price of the nece&s;&s;aries of life is not equal to the quantity of gold in circulation. This ari&s;es from the great want of money in the neigh|bouring Hungary. You have good wine here for three kreutzers, or three farthings Engli&s;h, the bottle, and a very good dinner for 3d. I knew a traiteur, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> who for 13 &s;ols a head, furni&s;hed a <HI>table d'hote,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of vegetables, broiled meat, a pud|ding, roa&s;ted calf's liver, and beef fried, and a gill of wine included. In a word, a man of &s;mall fortune may live here very well, but if he has a great one, he will be certainly tempted to &s;pend it. The more nature gives, the more nece&s;&s;ities men create to them&s;elves, and &s;he is &s;o profu&s;e here, that they of cour&s;e become &s;o too. The infinite number of richly pen&s;ioned dependents of the court, the numerous no|bility, and the many &s;trangers who come here, mere|ly for amu&s;ement, know no other plea&s;ure than to fol|low it, where&s;oever it leads, riches, idlene&s;s, and the liberality of nature mu&s;t render a people di&s;&s;ipated, where religion is the oppo&s;ite to frugality, and who&s;e governors cannot give their &s;pirits any other occu|pation.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="152">The individuals of a country which exi&s;ts only by &s;ubordination, will, of cour&s;e, be weak and feeble cha|racters. Though no nation has &s;o much checked the power of their kings at different periods as the Engli&s;h: yet hi&s;tory affords no greater in&s;tances of the devotion of individuals to the &s;overeign. The &s;ame love which the Engli&s;hman has for liberty, extends to the per|&s;on of the prince, as long as the &s;overeign leaves the con&s;titution unmole&s;ted, and manife&s;ts a love for his people. So that a Briton will pre&s;erve &s;trength of character, as long as his con&s;titution la&s;ts.</P>
<P>The government of this place endeavours to make &s;ome amends for the univer&s;al &s;ubjection under which the&s;e people are held by a mo&s;t exact admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, by taking mea&s;ures for univer&s;al &s;ecurity, and by the free admi&s;&s;ion and encouragement of every plea&s;ure (the &s;ingle one of lawle&s;s love alone except|ed) that can delight the human mind. The police is &s;o vigilant and acute, that the mo&s;t &s;ubtle thefts are commonly di&s;covered, and the owner gets his goods again. The Imperial hou&s;es and gardens are almo&s;t con&s;tantly open to the public. The players are un|der the peculiar protection of a court, who &s;hews, in every thing, that the re&s;traint it lays the people under, ari&s;es more from principle than the de&s;ire of tyran|nizing over them.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="153">Yet, notwith&s;tanding all this plea&s;ure, and all this &s;ecurity, I had rather, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> be expo&s;ed to a London footpad, or have the bottles and gla&s;&s;es whi&s;tle round my head on the la&s;t night of Vauxhall, than enjoy all the placid tranquillity of this place.

<P>The late Emperor <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> II. was of an affable di&s;po|&s;ition, and in fact the &s;itting magi&s;trate of Vienna. He heard the complaints of all ranks of people; for the meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects had free acce&s;s to him. His di&s;pen&s;ations in ju&s;ticiary matters were truly ex|cellent, and well worth the attention of princes, who&s;e de&s;ire is to admini&s;ter equity and ju&s;tice to their &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The following anecdote of him is well known: a poor family, the father of which had worn out his better days as a &s;oldier, in the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, and was entitled to &s;ome claim for tho&s;e &s;ervices, not having &s;ufficient intere&s;t to procure them, was pining out the remainder of his life in want and di&s;tre&s;s. He at la&s;t thought of petitioning the Emperor, and &s;ent one of his daughters with the petition. The Emperor was &s;o &s;truck with the appearance of the girl, and &s;o won by her mode&s;t deportment, that he not only &s;igned the paper, ordering the claims to be made good, but

added Let a pen&s;ion of 600 livres be annually paid him. <HI>(See the plate.)</HI></P>
<P>The hand of ju&s;tice in all chri&s;tian &s;tates &s;hould be tempered by the &s;oft feelings of mercy, and the wretch, who, violating the laws de&s;erves puni&s;hment, &s;hould be meliorated by the remi&s;&s;ion of every &s;pecies of torture. A noble fundamental principle of Briti&s;h laws! In Vienna, the way of executing criminals is commonly done by cutting off their heads; though in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on, they fir&s;t cut off the right hand: the executioner generally &s;trikes off the head with one blow.</P>
<P>In the city of Vienna, as I have ob&s;erved, &s;warms of literary characters are to be found. Some of whom are above and &s;ome below mediocrity. It would be invidious in me to point out their defects, and weak to &s;peak in their prai&s;e; &s;uffice it therefore to &s;ay, that there are &s;ome of all denominations.

<P>The ta&s;te for dramatic writing is now revived, and the rational amu&s;ement of the &s;tage &s;eems now to be in a fair way to be retrieved from its long neglected &s;tate.

<P>The city of Baden is &s;ituate about 18 miles &s;outh of Vienna. It is a neat well built town, and a place of public re&s;ort in the &s;ummer, on account of its hot baths. The German phy&s;icians pre&s;cribe its waters, (and i&s;&s;uing from rocks of &s;alt, allum, and brim&s;tone, they ta&s;te &s;trangely of the&s;e minerals) as &s;alutary for valetudinarians; and particularly beneficial in all di&s;|orders of the head, &s;uch as head-aches, dimne&s;s of &s;ight, deafne&s;s, &amp;c.

external applications. Modern practice of the facul|ty recommends this water as an antidote again&s;t the gout; as well as for the drop&s;y and other chronical di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>There is nothing to attract the traveller's attention in this city, except the &s;alubrity of the climate, and the fa&s;hionable re&s;ort of the higher ranks of the citizens of Vienna. The u&s;ual ta&s;te for di&s;&s;ipation and genteel vices are not wanting here. For there are no &s;pies of cha&s;tity, nor yoke of moral conduct, as at the capital, &s;o that all ranks indulge in tho&s;e plea&s;ures that are mo&s;t &s;uitable to their inclinations.</P>
<P>Baden wants none of the requi&s;ites that con&s;titute a place of luxurious enjoyments, added to the great good qualities of its &s;prings.</P>
<P>The dukedom of Stitia, and the earldom of Cilley, have Gratz and Cilley as the principal cities. The former &s;ituated on the banks of the river Muer, and the latter on the banks of the river Drave. There are no vineyards in this part of the country, but the na|tive &s;upplies are plentiful in every other article of life. It is very remarkable that in this country, the natives are frequently troubled with a &s;truma, or &s;welling on their throats or chins, to a mon&s;trous degree. This epidemical di&s;temper is &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from the &s;now-water they drink, which falls from the moun|tains;
<PB N="143" REF="158">
but the nobility and better &s;ort of people, who drink wine and other &s;trong liquors, are &s;eldom troubled with it.</P>
<P>Gratz is a well built town, its &s;treets are &s;pacious and well laid out, the ca&s;tle &s;tands on a high hill, and has the conveniency of a well that has a communica|tion with the Muer, for the convenience of water carriage to Hungary. It has a good armory and al&s;o &s;pacious magazines. In the Je&s;uits library here is &s;hewn a manu&s;cript tran&s;lation of the Bible, at the conclu&s;ion of which is a memoir, &s;ignifying that it was written and fini&s;hed by <HI>Era&s;mus Stratter,</HI> at Saltz|burg, before the Ember week in autumn, 1469. In this manu&s;cript, the &s;o much di&s;puted text in the 5th chapter of the 1&s;t Epi&s;tle of St. <HI>John,</HI> v. 7. con|cerning the three witne&s;&s;es in heaven is to be found, but the &s;ixth ver&s;e runs thus, <HI>And the &s;pirit is that which witne&s;&s;eth that Chri&s;t is the truth.</HI> The text in a printed Bible, to be &s;een there, is expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner. The rea&s;on why this text is not to be found in &s;o many manu&s;cripts is well known, but all the craft of the enemies of our holy faith has but little weight, as the connexion not only nece&s;&s;arily requires the &s;entence in di&s;pute, but <HI>Tertullian,</HI> &s;o early as the &s;econd, and St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> in the third century, ex|pre&s;sly appeal to this pa&s;&s;age.

of Sienna, exchanging her heart for that of Chri&s;t. Not far from it is the portrait of St. <HI>Alan,</HI> a Domini|can monk, who was a native of England. An in|&s;cription beneath, according to <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> &s;ays, that the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was &s;o plea&s;ed with the love he bore her, that in the pre&s;ence of the Son of God, an infinite multitude of angels and ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits, &s;he was e&s;pou&s;ed to St. <HI>Alan,</HI> gave him with her virgin mouth a ki&s;s of everla&s;ting peace, refre&s;hed him with the milk of her cha&s;te brea&s;ts, and pre&s;ented him with a ring in token of the marriage. This pretended &s;tep-father and fo&s;|ter brother of our Lord, died in 1475. That the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> &s;hould expo&s;e her bo&s;om in the pre&s;ence of many &s;pectators, will not appear &s;trange to tho&s;e who from other legends have learned, that it is not uncommon for them to repre&s;ent her as conde&s;cend|ing to &s;uch familiarities with her favourite votaries, as not to be read without a blu&s;h. This devout <HI>Alan</HI> informs us, that the Virgin once paid a formal vi&s;it to St. <HI>Dominic,</HI> the founder of his order, attended by three maids of honour, each of which had a retinue of 150 angels. He adds, that the&s;e three maids of ho|nour repre&s;ented the three per&s;ons in the ble&s;&s;ed Tri|nity, by whom <HI>Dominic</HI> (who had fallen into a &s;woon at the radiancy of this cele&s;tial vi&s;it) was rai&s;ed and delivered into the hands of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> who re|ceived him as her bridegroom, ki&s;&s;ed and &s;uckled him at her brea&s;t. <HI>Cra&s;&s;us</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;arius</HI> give us an account of many more &s;uch conde&s;cending weddings. Some

&s;en&s;ible Romani&s;ts however, not of this order, have openly expre&s;&s;ed their abhorrence of &s;uch impious fictions.</P>
<P>In the market-place at Gratz is a fine pillar of gilt bra&s;s erected to the Trinity; the town is well fortified, and contains be&s;ides a pari&s;h church, eight cloy&s;ters with their churches, and about 30,000 inhabitants.</P>
<P>There are per&s;ons in it who have incomes from 30 to 40,000 florins, and the luxury that prevails is not to be de&s;cribed; they have four regular meals, morn|ing, noon, evening, and night; ducks and chickens are the ordinary food of the common citizens. They made me almo&s;t &s;ick, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> with the &s;ight of their pa&s;ties, tarts, ragouts, &amp;c. They talk of no|thing but the kitchen, and the cellar, the attention to cooking only excepted, and do not &s;eem many degrees above Orang-outangs. This al&s;o is the great mart for all indecent and irreligious books; and hence they are &s;ent into other countries.</P>
<P>Two &s;tages from Gratz, in the way to Vienna, on the right of Retel&s;tein, is a cave, out of which are continually dug &s;everal large bones called <HI>uni|cornu fo&s;&s;ile,</HI> not unlike tho&s;e of Can&s;tein. The en|trance is very large and the cave runs under a rock to the di&s;tance, 'tis &s;aid, of two German miles, or eight Engli&s;h ones. It is conjectured that the&s;e bones
<PB N="146" REF="161">
belonged to cattle or wild bea&s;ts, who, at the time of the deluge, or &s;ome other extraordinary inundation, had &s;heltered them&s;elves here. The vulgar call them dragons teeth, or giants bones, and imagine that be|fore the deluge, this cavern was the abode of &s;avage women.</P>
<P>The Dukedom of Carinthia has St. Veit for its ca|pital, and is famous for its early reception of the chri&s;|tian religion. The duchy of Carniola has Trie&s;te for its chief town. There is a curious lake in this duke|dom, 70 miles in length, and 35 in breadth, &s;ur|rounded by high mountains, that in the month of June, annually, retires under ground, and returns again in September, with great violence &s;pouting up the water to a great heighth. But what is mo&s;t &s;ingu|lar, during the ab&s;ence of the waters, the bottom of the lake is &s;uddenly covered over with gra&s;s, &s;o that cattle graze there with &s;afety.</P>
<P>The county of Tyrol has In&s;pruc for its metropolis, which contains 14,000 inhabitants. And tho&s;e of Brixen and Trent, have towns of the &s;ame names. The&s;e three &s;tates are remarkable for their productions in fo&s;&s;ils, both in &s;tones and gems.</P>
<P>The commerce of this country is now extremely flouri&s;hing, but it was a long time before the Au&s;trians knew how to enjoy the advantage, which nature had

Notwith&s;tanding they were ma&s;ters of one of the large&s;t rivers in the world, which carries &s;hips upwards of 70 German miles before it comes to them, and afterwards opens them a way into the Le|vant and Black &s;ea; there was no &s;pirit of trade be|fore the time of <HI>Francis</HI>&mdash;. Trade was con&s;idered as below the attention of a gentleman; and though the emperor <HI>Francis</HI> was him&s;elf a merchant, and by de|grees the nobility began to look upon the indu&s;trious trade&s;man with &s;omewhat le&s;s degree of contempt; &s;till a great deal was re&s;erved for the late emperor, <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> II. who&s;e popularity and aver&s;ion to old pre|judices, are in no in&s;tances more con&s;picuous than in this. He introduced ingenious arti&s;ts and merchants into the fir&s;t &s;ocieties. It is true indeed, that tho&s;e who think all merit con&s;i&s;ts in birth and external ap|pearance, neglect nothing to make the plebean feel he is out of his element; but a word from the mo|narch &s;ets all to rights, and the more the noble&s;&s;e di&s;|turbed them&s;elves, the more <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was &s;ure to take opportunities of humbling their pride. Some years ago, when he was at Prague, he came into a large company, leading a citizen's wife by the hand: all the ladies immediately began to &s;tare, but he took no farther notice of it, than by going down a dance with her, the only dance he danced.</P>
<P>With all this, however, trade is &s;till far below what it might be; but it makes great &s;trides every day. It
<PB N="148" REF="163">
is &s;aid there are already above a hundred &s;ilk-weavers looms in Vienna. There are al&s;o plu&s;h and cotton manufactures; and foreign trade is carried on with Au&s;trian and Hungarian wines, Bohemian and Mo|ravian linens, (which go by Trie&s;te into Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Turkey) wrought iron, &s;teel, and cop|per, leather, china, and other articles.&mdash;The&s;e pro|duce many millions. All this the government pro|tects &s;o heartily, that it has always a fund ready for the encouragement of the enterpri&s;ing and di&s;crete projector. This fund lends out money without inte|re&s;t, for five, &s;ix, or even ten years, after which it re|ceives intere&s;t gradually, from one to two or three per cent. From the&s;e beginners great advantages are, no doubt, to be expected in the next genera|tion, when in&s;tead of being proud of their debts, the nobility &s;hall deign to be in company with a rich trader, and in&s;tead of rea&s;oning on a bill of fare, will conver&s;e with him on the profits of the year.</P>

<P>THIS circle terminates on that of Franconia, the Upper Rhine, and the circle of Lower Saxony, as al&s;o on the Baltic &s;ea; Pru&s;&s;ia, Poland, Sile&s;ia, Lu&s;atia and Bohemia. Its whole extent being e&s;ti|mated at 1950 &s;quare geographical miles.</P>

<P>The duchy of Saxony, which gives the Elector the title of Duke, is of no great extent, and bounded by the principality of Anhalt on the N. Lu&s;atia and part of Brandenburg on the E. Mi&s;nia on the S. and Mans|feldt and Thuringia on the W. But the electoral country contains 210 towns, 61 market-towns, 3157 villages, 1591 gentlemens e&s;tates, with villages an|nexed, 130 royal citadels, and 196 royal manners; in the whole 225 towns, and 5685 villages.</P>
<P>The air of this country is cold, but healthful. The &s;oil yields wheat and &s;ome wine, though not in great plenty. There are &s;everal mines of &s;ilver, and other metals, but the want of fuel to work them with, pre|vents the Elector from ri&s;ing the ore.</P>
<P>Of this duchy, which alone contains 24 cities and towns, three boroughs, and 494 villages, Witten|burg is the chief city, but Dre&s;den is the metropolis of the electorate.</P>
<P>This electorate has had the honour of giving ri&s;e to the reformation in the tenth century, and the Pro|te&s;tant Lutheran church is the prevailing &s;ect here. The Calvini&s;ts, as well as the Roman-catholics, have,

<P>The &s;ciences flouri&s;h in this electorate, printing being at no place more common, and book-&s;elling no where more con&s;iderable than at Leip&s;ic. At Mei&s;&s;en, Pforte, and Grimma are princely, country &s;chools, and good &s;eminaries at other places.</P>
<P>The u&s;eful and fine manufactures and fabricks are very numerous in this electorate. Great quantities of yarn are &s;pun here, thread bleached, coar&s;e and fine linen wove, and tick made, together with cere|cloth, fine lace, ribband, edging, and paper. The porcelain of Mei&s;&s;en is famous throughout all Eu|rope, and known al&s;o in other principal parts of the world, under the name of Dre&s;den china. Fine gla&s;&s;es and mirrors are made here, and out of the &s;er|pent &s;tone all manner of things. Iron is wrought here, al&s;o &s;teel and bra&s;s. Saxony has likewi&s;e its manufac|tures of gold and &s;ilver; cotton, wool, and &s;ilk are made up here in handkerchiefs, cloths, fu&s;tians, flannels, &s;tuffs, plu&s;h, and &s;tockings. It makes al&s;o gloves, caps, and hats. Here are be&s;ides fine tape&s;tries; and in the&s;e manufactured wares, as well as in the natural productions of the country, namely, in corn, flax, ani&s;e, woad, blue, &s;tarch, ar&s;enic, &s;affron, wine, &amp;c. and in cattle, wool, and many other articles an import|ant foreign commerce is carried on. The tin
<PB N="152" REF="168">
here is very exellent, and gems they have in great plenty.</P>
<P>The Elbe is the principle river in this country, and greatly promotes its trade. Leip&s;ic is not only the greate&s;t trading town in this electorate, but one of the greate&s;t in all Germany.</P>
<P>The Elector of Saxony &s;tiles him&s;elf, Duke of Sax|ony, Juliers, Cleve, and the Berg; al&s;o of Engers and We&s;tphalia; archmar&s;hal and elector of the holy Roman empire, Landgrave in Thuringia, Margrave of Mei&s;&s;en and of Upper and Lower Lu&s;atia, Burgrave of Magdeburg, princely count of Henneberg, count of the Mark, Raven&s;berg, Barby, and Hanau, and lord of Raven&s;tein, and he is now cho&s;en pre&s;ump|tive heir to the crown of Poland. His arms for Sax|ony are a garland of rue for the head and hair. The diet is held at Dre&s;den.</P>
<P>The chief cities in this electorate, and tho&s;e we &s;hall &s;peak of, are Wittenburg, Leip&s;ic and Dre&s;|den.</P>
<P>Wittenburg is the head town of the circle, lying not far from the Elbe, over which it has a ferry; the city is not large but fortified; the old citadel was formerly the electoral palace, and here are kept the common archives of the Saxon hou&s;es. It has a
<PB N="153" REF="169">
univer&s;ity, and the number of &s;tudents are about 700, where they are taught the arts of dancing, fencing, and other polite accompli&s;hments. They are under the care of 12 profe&s;&s;ors who teach Latin, Greek, and French. Young per&s;ons are &s;ent hither from all parts of Germany, particularly from Hamburg and Dantzic.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sokoloff</HI> church here is a building of about 300 years &s;tanding, where <HI>Martin Luther</HI> fir&s;t preached the doctrine which occa&s;ioned the revolt from the Roman principles. He is al&s;o interred here, but has no other monument than a &s;imple bra&s;s plate with an in&s;cription, except his original portrait at length, painted on wood, and well pre&s;erved &s;ince 1540.</P>
<P>The people in Leip&s;ic, as in mo&s;t places, where the Lutheran religion prevails, have a &s;trong tincture of Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition. Among &s;everal in&s;tances of which the credulous firmly believe and report as a fact, that in the library now belonging to the acade|my, the <HI>Devil</HI> paid a vi&s;it to <HI>Luther,</HI> and offered to &s;hake hands with the reformer, as a mark of politene&s;s and re&s;pect, at which the pious man was &s;o incen&s;ed that he took up his large, leaden ink-&s;tand, and threw it right in the intruder's face, &s;o that he was obliged to make a precipitate retreat, all &s;meared over with ink, muttering horridly that he would be revenged of the doctor, who had &s;o &s;aucily treated him, for no other
<PB N="154" REF="170">
cau&s;e than his friendly attention to him to call and a&s;k him how he did!</P>
<P>Indeed this mark of di&s;re&s;pect in <HI>Luther,</HI> &s;trongly indicated his re&s;olute determination to be at continual variance with the prince of the air; for hone&s;t <HI>Martin,</HI> built his fabric on a &s;olid foundation, and erected the whole fabric with faith and good works as the &s;tone and lime of durability, which, no doubt, greatly di&s;|plea&s;ed his highne&s;s who is highly delighted with the frivolity of ceremony.</P>
<P>But as all human inventions are imperfect in their con&s;truction as well as application, and always admit of &s;everal amendments, we cannot omit this oppor|tunity of paying the good man the highe&s;t compli|ment for his extraordinary talents in removing the veil of darkne&s;s from the eyes of millions then un|born! not to &s;peak of the grand work he performed then of di&s;ciplining thou&s;ands by the force of rational argument and appealing to the under&s;tandings of men of common capacities.</P>
<P>In this city are at lea&s;t 500 private manufactories in various branches; particularly the art of dyeing is performed here in a &s;uperior &s;tile, &s;o that from all parts of the country for many miles di&s;tant, cloths are &s;ent to be dyed, blue, green and &s;carlet. Hence the elegant colours of the&s;e hues, are emphatically
<PB N="155" REF="171">
called <HI>Saxon,</HI> thereby implying that they are of fa&s;t colours. The nap, pile, or &s;heering, is grained ac|cording to any order &s;ent, with extraordinary neat|ne&s;s, and the newe&s;t face po&s;&s;ible appears on the goods; an act worthy of imitation and attention.</P>
<P>Leip&s;ic is the next city in this electorate, and is the capital of Mi&s;nia; it is a very &s;mall but very hand|&s;ome, and, in &s;ome places, &s;plendid city, though it has been the theatre of almo&s;t every German war. It is &s;ituated in a plea&s;ant, fruitful plain, at the meeting of three &s;mall rivers, <HI>viz.</HI> the El&s;ter, Plei&s;ca, and Parda, about 40 miles N. W. of Dre&s;den. It is a town of great trade, e&s;pecially at the three annual fairs of Chri&s;tmas, Ea&s;ter, and Michaelmas, when their &s;treets are crowded with foreign merchants.</P>
<P>The civility and politene&s;s of the inhabitants, its elegant buildings and the delightful gardens with which it is &s;urrounded, make it appear &s;uperior to ma|ny capital cities. The country round it is very plea|&s;ant and well cultivated. Its fertility draws hither multitudes of larks which are very fat and has a deli|cate flavour, &s;o that Leip&s;ic larks are famous all over Germany, and the exci&s;e on them produces &pound;.900 a year &s;terling to the city; the revenue accruing to the Elector from this city alone is computed at &pound;. 70,000 a year. In the &s;and-pits about Leip&s;ic are dug up corals, &s;tar-&s;tones, &s;hells, and other marine produc|tions,
<PB N="156" REF="172">
which &s;eem to confirm the account of the uni|ver&s;al deluge, for though the land be mo&s;tly level, it lies pretty high, the neighbouring rivers are never known to overflow the country, nor are the marine productions, found here, ever found in tho&s;e rivers.</P>
<P>The commerce and manufactures of this place are very con&s;iderable. It is the centre of the book-trade of all Germany, and of the wool-trade of all Saxony, and there are few cities in Germany which &s;urpa&s;s it in commerce and exchange. Here they make vel|vets, woven &s;ilks, &s;hags, linens, cloths, rattines, car|pets, and a great variety of other things. This city &s;upplies the greate&s;t part of Saxony with drugs, and has a con&s;iderable &s;hare of the trade which is carried on betwixt the &s;outh of Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and the north. There are &s;everal wealthy hou&s;es here. The fair is no more than a &s;hadow of what it was thirty years ago. The mo&s;t remarkable part of the pre&s;ent trade, is the exchange of books, carried on by the German book&s;ellers. Their number is about 300, and the value of the books they exchange amounts to 500,000 rix-dollars, or about &pound;.73,000 &s;terling: formerly they had three fairs, and merchants brought or &s;ent goods from every part of Europe; va&s;t maga|zines were formed of Ea&s;t-India goods of all &s;orts, and of We&s;t-India commodities; but the wars have been its de&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="173">There are no eccle&s;ia&s;tical buildings here worth no|tice, except the church of St. Nicholas, which is &s;aid to be the fine&s;t Lutheran church in all Germany. The exchange is a very noble &s;tructure, and the cieling of the hall well painted. There is a famous univer&s;ity here, which con&s;i&s;t of only four colleges, as the &s;tu|dents are not confined to their chambers, as in other places, but the buildings are not &s;o fine in any re|&s;pect, as tho&s;e of Oxford.</P>
<P>In this city the purity of the German language is pre&s;erved with great care. The library of this uni|ver&s;ity contains 12,000 well cho&s;en volumes. The half of which are in folio. This library is open for the u&s;e of the public from ten to twelve, on Wedne&s;|days and Saturdays.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame days, in the afternoon, free acce&s;s is allowed to the magi&s;trates' library, which con&s;i&s;ts of 25,000 volumes, many of which are well cho&s;en.</P>
<P>The cabinets of urns, antiques and medals, are kept in good order. There are al&s;o &s;everal copper-plate prints and de&s;igns by the mo&s;t celebrated ma&s;ters; an Egyptian mummy, entire, with its coffin and hieroglyphical characters; four globes, each 12 feet in circumference. Here are likewi&s;e &s;hewn petrifac|tions, fo&s;&s;ils, minerals, and other curio&s;ities of nature and art. There are al&s;o &s;everal fine paintings to be &s;een here, in high pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="174">In <HI>Richter</HI>'s collection, various curio&s;ities of the kingdoms of nature are to be &s;een pre&s;erved in bal|&s;amic &s;pirits. The animal kingdom takes up 800 gla&s;&s;es, and are very rare &s;ubjects, among&s;t which are &s;everal extraordinary &s;keletons of the human &s;pecies, well worth the in&s;pection of the learned traveller. The exotics of land and water are very numerous and intere&s;ting. In the mineral kingdom there are 130 gla&s;&s;es, exhibiting petrifactions of many parts of ani|mal and vegetable nature, particularly the complete &s;keleton of a large crocodile. In this curious collec|tion, there is one pearl valued at 1800l. Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The connoi&s;&s;eur will find plenty of matter for an unlimited indulgence here; for every thing that can delight the virtuo&s;o is to be &s;elected by the &s;cientific adept.</P>
<P>The way of living, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> is totally different here from that of the other Saxon towns; and much more luxury and profu&s;ion reigns here than at Dre&s;|den. They play in all companies, and often ex|tremely high. The ladies of this place are far be|hind-hand with the re&s;t of their country-women of other towns, in dome&s;tic oeconomy, but agree with them in the articles of dre&s;s and coquetry.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the literati, who &s;warm here, there are too many petit-maitres, boa&s;ters, ignoramu&s;&s;es and
<PB N="159" REF="175">
fools of all &s;orts. But you meet with men in all &s;ci|ences, (continues <HI>Rei&s;bec,)</HI> who, from the extent, as well as the depth, of their learning, are really de|&s;irable companions.</P>
<P>There are 40,000 inhabitants within the walls, and the &s;uburbs al&s;o are filled with people. They have &s;ix churches for the Lutherans, which is the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, one for the reformed, and a chapel for the Roman-catholics in the ca&s;tle; but this la&s;t is not permitted to u&s;e bells.</P>
<P>They have adopted a new kind of luxury, even in their devotion, &s;ays <HI>Hanway,</HI> for one of the capital churches has a number of chapels projecting about &s;ix feet from the main wall, through which they commu|nicate with the church, each chapel having its di&s;tinct door without. Some of the riche&s;t citizens have be&s;tow|ed on the&s;e auxilliary buildings 1500, or 2000 dollars.</P>
<P>The &s;ober part of the people think the expence had been better be&s;towed on the poor, as the affectation of &s;o great a di&s;tinction is by no means con&s;i&s;tent with that equality which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be among their addre&s;&s;es to Almighty God. It &s;eems to be the re|mains of that pa&s;&s;ion which the Romans had for the &s;plendid embelli&s;hments of their temples.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="176">The people here affect to be religious; and it is a con&s;tant cu&s;tom ob&s;erved, to &s;hut their &s;hops up every Friday morning, and during their devotions, which la&s;t till 10 o'clock, if any per&s;on pre&s;umes to &s;ell any thing, they are &s;ubject to a fine of ten crowns.</P>
<P>The fortifications of Leip&s;ic &s;eem rather calculated for the u&s;e of the inhabitants to walk on, than for de|fence. The&s;e, however, have four &s;tone gates, and the citizens &s;upport 200 &s;oldiers; this exempts them from quarters, though they are otherwi&s;e &s;ubject to be taxed as arbitrarily as any town in Saxony.</P>
<P>This city is of a very &s;mall extent; but the hou&s;es are lofty, as well as elegant, in their fronts. Some of them have three &s;tories of cellars, as well as of gra|naries on the tops of them, to the number of three or four &s;tories; &s;o that the whole makes an appearance of &s;even, eight, or nine &s;tories. The &s;treets are clean, commodious and agreeable, and there are two or three large &s;quares which they u&s;e as market-places.</P>
<P>But what adds much to the agreeablene&s;s of this city, are the gardens which &s;urround it, particularly the <HI>Apel</HI> garden, which is in an excellent ta&s;te, con|&s;idering that it is almo&s;t upon a flat. The &s;tatues are very indifferent, yet &s;o arranged as to produce a plea&s;ing effect. This elegant garden is kept up by the

public &s;ub&s;cription of the citizens, although open to all genteel &s;trangers without any expence.</P>
<P>Dre&s;den is the metropolis of the electorate, has a grand appearance, and opens on all &s;ides a magni|ficent object. It is beyond all compari&s;on, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;|bech,</HI> the fine&s;t city in all Germany he ever &s;aw. The hou&s;es are built in a much better ta&s;te than tho&s;e of Vienna; and the eye is quite dazzled with the large and magnificent appearance of the bridge over the Elbe, which joins the two parts of the city together, and which is built on a plain, on both &s;ides the river, &s;ur|rounded by lofty hills, at the di&s;tance of ten leagues. The bridge is built of &s;tone, 540 feet long, and 36 broad, on 18 arches. The pa&s;&s;age over it is hori|zontal, and takes off very much from the grand effect it would otherwi&s;e have, if formed in a curve, as are the bridges of Blackfriars and We&s;tmin&s;ter in London.</P>
<P>Great order is ob&s;erved in pa&s;&s;ing this bridge, one &s;ide being appointed to lead to the new city, and the other to the old. Near the latter, it is adorned with a crucifix of bra&s;s, of curious workman&s;hip, about half as big as life. It is fixed on a &s;tone pede&s;tal, on which are the emblems of death and the devil, re|pre&s;ented by a human &s;kull and a &s;erpent in bra&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="179">The river, which at &s;ome di&s;tance from the city, is compri&s;ed within very narrow bounds, widens by de|grees as you approach, and is here a powerful &s;tream, which be&s;peaks all the magnificence of the town and &s;tate. The hills, at a di&s;tance, have a &s;uperb ap|pearance; and the mountains on both &s;ides the river, partly naked and partly planted with vineyards, form an uncommonly beautiful per&s;pective.</P>
<P>Here are &s;everal &s;quares and lofty &s;tone buildings, in which are &s;ix or &s;even &s;tories. The rooms, though neat, are not large. The buildings make an elegant appearance, but are inferior in beauty to Berlin. Dre&s;den is an ancient city, and many of the &s;treets, of cour&s;e, are narrow.</P>
<P>In a kind of open place or &s;quare, between the old city and the new, is an eque&s;trian &s;tatue of King <HI>Au|gu&s;tus,</HI> made by a common &s;mith, the workman&s;hip however is but indifferent.</P>
<P>Few princes in Europe are &s;o magnificently lodged as the Elector of Saxony.</P>
<P>The Electoral Palace, in the New Town, is well worth the attention of the curious. It is large, and contains many beautiful apartments. The hall, e&s;pe|cially, is admired for its many beautiful paintings in fre&s;co. On both &s;ides of the gallery &s;tand &s;everal
<PB N="163" REF="180">
large va&s;es of beautiful porphyry, with a great number of marble and bra&s;s bu&s;ts. The room ad|joining to this gallery is full of portraits of the fir&s;t per&s;onages of Europe.</P>
<P>But the place that will afford the greate&s;t entertain|ment, to the curious, is the Green Vault, as it is call|ed, which is a mu&s;eum. Here are &s;even apartments painted green, and the curio&s;ities di&s;po&s;ed cla&s;&s;ically, and depo&s;ited in them. I will not enumerate the pro|digious number of curio&s;ities, natural and artificial, to be &s;een here, as it would fill a volume. Some of the la&s;t, indeed, are curious, becau&s;e they are invi|&s;ible to the human eye. Of this number is a cherry-&s;tone; upon which, by the help of a micro&s;cope, above one hundred faces may be di&s;tingui&s;hed. The&s;e little mechanical whims, undoubtedly, di&s;play the labour, per&s;everance and minute attention of the workmen; but they are not proofs of the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e who can employ arti&s;ts to &s;o little purpo&s;e. In the fir&s;t apartment are all manner of models of metal &s;tatues and bu&s;ts, in pla&s;ter of Paris; in the &s;econd, is a variety of curious works in ivory; in the third, pure &s;ilver work; in the fourth, gilt &s;ilver plate and ve&s;&s;els of pure gold; in the fifth, pure precious &s;tones and curio&s;ities formed in them; the &s;ixth, the arms of the &s;everal Saxon countries, the crown, &s;ceptre and Imperial apple; and, in the &s;eventh, &s;ome very rare jewels. I will mention &s;ome few of the mo&s;t curious
<PB N="164" REF="181">
articles for the information and amu&s;ement of &s;uch of my readers as may delight in &s;uch reading.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e rooms are various pieces of clock-work well worth examining. The&s;e are automata of various kinds in gold and &s;ilver, made by <HI>Dinglinger,</HI> the famous mechani&s;t. Among the&s;e is a &s;hip &s;ailing round a table, while &s;ome of the &s;ailors in it weigh anchor, and the re&s;t are in continual action; and, at the &s;ame time, it performs a piece of mu&s;ic. An|other piece of clock-work repre&s;ents the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> with the infant <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> in a manger, and the &s;hepherds, with the ea&s;tern magi, performing their adorations to the Me&s;&s;iah, while the heaven &s;eems to open with a &s;urprizing effulgence: be&s;ides many others equally curious and intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>In the next room is a different &s;pecies of artificial works in ivory. And, in like order, other rooms &s;hew, gold, &s;ilver, precious &s;tones, and gems of great value. Added to the&s;e, enamelled tables of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip, and really things highly advantageous to the arti&s;t and man of &s;cience.</P>
<P>A work of jewelry is al&s;o much admired; this re|pre&s;ents the celebration of the Mogul's birth-day, the Mogul &s;itting on his throne, his grandees and guards, and many elephants, all exhibited on a table about an ell &s;quare. This employed the arti&s;t and 15

a&s;&s;i&s;tants above ten years, and co&s;t 85,000 dollars. Here is likewi&s;e repre&s;ented, in pearl, the &s;tory of the prophet <HI>Jonah,</HI> the &s;hip, the whale, the prophet, the rocks and the &s;ea. Another article &s;hewn and made by the &s;ame jeweller, for which he was paid 46,000 dollars, is a tea equipage, with the table, &amp;c. all of gold enamelled, and &s;et with diamonds.</P>
<P>The great value of the different gems and jewels in this cabinet is almo&s;t pa&s;t belief. There is here an onyx that co&s;t 48,000 dollars. It is of an oval form, near a quarter of an ell in its longe&s;t diameter; al&s;o a ba&s;on of oriental agate, as large as half a cocoa nut, cut longitudinally. Among the &s;ingle gems are a large oriental &s;apphire, a very extraordinary large to|paz, of a reddi&s;h water, with a great number of pre|cious &s;tones to an immen&s;e value; particularly an en|tire a&s;&s;ortment of diamonds, being a &s;et of buttons for a &s;uit of cloaths, and the badge of the order of knight|hood, with the &s;tar, buckles, and head of a cane, &amp;c. In the order of knighthood is a diamond for which the king of Poland, a few years ago, paid 200,000 dollars, it weighs 194&frac12; grains. It is placed be|tween two diamonds, each of which is equal to a large nutmeg, and in the cane-head is a diamond of the &s;ame bigne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Elector <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> was the founder of this mu|&s;eum, and valuable articles are every year added to

it. There is al&s;o another in the palace very little in|ferior <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o this of the green vault. The mu&s;eum of Flo|rence, with its contents, may in value exceed this col|lection, but the judicious arrangement of the &s;everal pieces here, give it an appearance which plea&s;es the eye beyond the Florentine mu&s;eum.</P>
<P>In the palace is an apartment full of a collection of fine prints of all kinds, and a mineral gallery contain|ing every thing relating to metallurgy, a&s;&s;ay, ores, &amp;c. and a model of a mine. Here is a topaz weigh|ing two or three cwt. but impure: &s;ome few years back, an inhabitant of Averbach, about two miles from Dre&s;den, di&s;covered a topaz quarry in a wood; it was in a rugged rock, 70 ells high. This rock is 240 paces in circumference. The topazes found here cut gla&s;s like the be&s;t diamond, and are not much in|ferior in colour to the oriental.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, this green room or mu&s;eum is filled with every production of nature that can be &s;aid to be valu|able and worth the labour of a minute in&s;pection.</P>
<P>The library of this Elector is very large, and well-cho&s;en, and the cabinet of medals, as well as the ana|tomical figures and putrifactions, are &s;ingularly cu|rious, and well di&s;po&s;ed, in order of arrangement. Ex|otic plants, (and their generical characters are finely di&s;played by the anatomy of them) are al&s;o &s;hewn in an
<PB N="167" REF="184">
adjoining apartment. It would be too tedious to enu|merate the collections of wood, doubtful names, ani|mals and other natural &s;ingularities; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that no place can exceed Dre&s;den for &s;uch various &s;pecimens of art and nature; mon&s;ters and &s;trange productions in a variety of &s;hapes.</P>
<P>The ar&s;enal is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain arms for 100,000 men be&s;ides 15,000 bra&s;s cannon, among which field-pieces are the &s;malle&s;t. There are two large mortars, which were pre&s;ented by the late king of Pru&s;&s;ia, that will throw bombs of 500 lb weight.</P>
<P>Under the ar&s;enal are the king's cellars, con&s;i&s;ting of four large and two &s;mall vaults. Two of the form|er are 175 common paces in length, and 100 broad, therefore by far the bigge&s;t of any &s;et of cellars in Europe, and &s;ufficient to &s;tow five thou&s;and pipes of wine at a time without incommoding the pa&s;&s;age; a thing almo&s;t incredible, was not <HI>Key&s;ler's</HI> veracity pledged for the fact.</P>
<P>The next curio&s;ity is the Chine&s;e palace, &s;o called from the ta&s;te of the buildings, and the intention of furni&s;hing it with porcelain. But <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI> &s;ays, not|with&s;tanding the exaggerated account of it in different writers, he thinks it a &s;illy affair, and by no means elegant. The ornaments of the architecture and the relievo in the fronti&s;piece, are after the Chine&s;e and
<PB N="168" REF="185">
Japan manner. This palace &s;tands on the Elbe, and commands a view of the bridge and of the Romi&s;h chapel, but it is far from being an elegant building, and is &s;eated too near the river.</P>
<P>The vaults of this palace con&s;i&s;t of 14 apartments filled with China and Dre&s;den porcelain. Figures of various kinds are to be &s;een here in porcelain, both &s;criptural and hi&s;toric: be&s;ides the&s;e, birds, bea&s;ts, and fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>In this Chine&s;e, or Japane&s;e palace, there is a &s;tate bed, with &s;ome chairs, made of beautiful feathers of different colours, which co&s;t 30,000 dollars. This palace, <HI>Key&s;ler</HI> tells us, was pulled down when he was there, which was in 1729, and it was to be new built in a quadrangular form, with four grand entries. The ground-floor was to be 20 feet high, and all ornament|ed with modern China. The &s;econd floor was to be 38 feet high, and nothing admitted but Mei&s;&s;en chi|na. In this &s;tory was to be a gallery 170 feet long, filled with all kinds of birds and bea&s;ts, both wild and tame, made of China, and in their natural &s;ize, and colour. Many of the&s;e were fini&s;hed, and he could not &s;ufficiently admire them.</P>
<P>In the menagerie were two mule leopards, each of which co&s;t 2000 dollars, got between a lion and a tygre&s;s, &s;wift as the latter, and &s;ome apes that bred.
<PB N="169" REF="186">
At the Elector's country &s;eat, he had 14 tame &s;tags which drew in a carriage, and one u&s;ed for the &s;addle. The&s;e &s;et out with great &s;pirit, but &s;oon &s;lagged.</P>
<P>A &s;uper&s;titious reverence for the Mei&s;&s;en china has induced the Elector to pre&s;erve &s;ome of the fir&s;t efforts of the porcelain fabric, and other per|formances in their &s;everal gradations to the perfection the art is now arrived at.</P>
<P>In order to pre&s;erve this art as much as po&s;&s;ible a &s;ecret, the fabric is rendered impenetrable to any but tho&s;e who are immediately employed about the work, and the &s;ecret of mixing and preparing is known to very few of them. The workmen are all confined as pri&s;oners, and &s;ubject to be arre&s;ted, if they go without the walls; con&s;equently a chapel and every thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary is provided within.</P>
<P>There are about 700 men employed, mo&s;t of whom have not above ten German crowns a month, and the highe&s;t wages are 40, &s;o that the annual expence is not e&s;timated above 80,000 crowns. This manufac|ture being intirely for the Elector's account, he &s;ells yearly to the value of about 600,000 crowns, or 105,000l. be&s;ides the magnificent pre&s;ents he occa|&s;ionally makes, and the great quantities he pre&s;erves for his own u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="187">It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate the multitude of pieces of fine porcelain, both foreign and home|made that are to be &s;een here. The culinary porce|lain ve&s;&s;els only are valued at a million of dollars. In one apartment are 48 va&s;es of blue and white Chi|na, for which the Elector gave the king of Pru&s;&s;ia a whole regiment of dragoons. The manufactory of common porcelain is carried on near Dre&s;den, but the fine &s;ort, which has a high price, is made with the &s;tricte&s;t precaution and &s;ecrecy in a ca&s;tle at Mei&s;&s;en. Dre&s;den owes the invention of its porcelain to alchymy. <HI>Botticker,</HI> the fir&s;t inventor of it, died in 1719, but he arrived at no farther than the white &s;ort, and it was not till 1722, that the art of making brown and white porcelain-ware was found out.</P>
<P>The articles of mineralogy and metallurgy &s;eem to be better under&s;tood here than in any other part of Europe, for the greate&s;t works of nature are repre|&s;ented by the modellers, with &s;uch &s;crupulous exactne&s;s, that no feature of the original is omitted: to &s;uch an effect have tho&s;e ingenious people brought the imitative arts.</P>
<P>The palace is furni&s;hed as becomes the man&s;ion of &s;uch a prince.

looking-gla&s;&s;es, in &s;ome of the&s;e apartments, are between eight and nine feet high, and &s;ix and &s;even broad; the a&s;&s;embly-room for the royal family is hung with rich tape&s;try, repre&s;enting the atchievements of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great. Among the &s;urprizing quantity of plate which is kept in the plate-cabinet, are four &s;tands, each weighing 470 marks, and 12 others not of much le&s;s weight; two va&s;es, each above five feet high, &s;carce to be fathomed by two men, weighing 600 marks each; two pieces of the &s;ame fa&s;hion, little inferior in weight; eight ci&s;terns, with the ve&s;&s;els &s;tanding in them, each weighing 800 marks. Not to mention the great number of curious clocks, beautiful tables, rich cabinets, and other furniture, here is a confi|dent's table, a curious piece of mechani&s;m, by means of which the Elector dines privately with his confi|dents; for this table, with all its appurtenances is brought up through the floor from the lower apart|ment into the upper, and not one &s;ervant &s;een in wait|ing. The ball-room is paved with marble, and in the pavement are two large oval pieces, &s;ix Dre&s;den ells in the longe&s;t diameter, and between the&s;e another piece of red and white marble, cut out of a &s;ingle block, which is four ells broad, and eleven ells or ten common paces in length. This extraordinary piece of marble was brought from Voightlande, and co&s;t 14000 dollars. The room opens into fine walks made on the ramparts, from whence we have a view of &s;everal boats, &amp;c. on the Elbe. On each &s;ide of
<PB N="172" REF="189">
this ball-room are &s;everal fine water-works, ca&s;cades, grottos, and baths. In the gardens are above 1500 &s;tatues of white marble, well di&s;po&s;ed, with a va&s;t number of ancient ones; the palace &s;tands in the cen|tre of the gardens. The garden is laid out in a &s;quare form, each &s;ide of which is 2600 common paces in length, that is more than an Engli&s;h mile. The &s;ta|bles, which, with the addition of a &s;econd &s;tory, may be properly called the old wardrobe, are full of &s;uch ornaments as are u&s;ed to decorate the royal apart|ments on public days, rich habits, with the arms and furniture of foreign nations. The&s;e take up no le&s;s than 42 rooms. In one is &s;hewn the armour worn by the corps de guard on the marriage-fea&s;ts of the ancient Electors, &s;o ornamented with &s;ilver, that a &s;ingle dag|ger weighs ten pounds, and the quantity of &s;ilver is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at 12 cwt. In another room are &s;hewn a giant's &s;word, &s;ent as a pre&s;ent from Denmark, the blade of which is five Dre&s;den ells in length, and a hor&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith its furniture, which formerly belonged to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">am of Tartary: this hor&s;e, with others here &s;hewn, are carved in wood, but exactly re&s;embling the ori|ginals both in &s;ize and colour.

The robe is of blue colour, flowered with gold, faced with ermine and lined with &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ue. The crown, &s;ceptre and globe, are only &s;et with fal&s;e &s;tones. A &s;tep lower &s;tands <HI>Charles</HI> XII. of Sweden, in a &s;ilver, half cuira&s;s on the left, and the Czar <HI>Peter</HI> on the right; and near the&s;e an executioner's &s;word, by which 1400 per&s;ons are &s;aid to have been beheaded. There are a thou&s;and other curio&s;ities of great anti|quity, too tedious to mention.</P>
<P>In the &s;tables are very hand&s;ome apartments, where foreigners of di&s;tinction are generally entertained. The ground-floor contains &s;tabling for 130 hor&s;es. The Doric pillars in the centre are adorned with ba&s;&s;o relievos of bra&s;s, and by turning a cock in the&s;e pil|lars, the &s;tables are &s;upplied with water for the hor&s;es.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the curio&s;ities to be met with at Dre&s;den, it would be unpardonable to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence <HI>John Melchior Dinglinger,</HI> the Elector's model|ler and jeweller, who flouri&s;hed in the beginning of this century. When the Czar, <HI>Peter</HI> the Great, was at Dre&s;den, in 1712, his maje&s;ty cho&s;e to lodge with
<PB N="174" REF="191">
<HI>Dinglinger,</HI> with who&s;e ingenious contrivances in his little box, he was &s;o plea&s;ed, that he ordered a model of it to be made in wood, and &s;ent it to Ru&s;&s;ia as a perfect &s;pecimen of a commodious dwelling-hou&s;e. On the top of it is a ci&s;tern, which one man, by means of a machine placed below in the yard, could fill with water in a very &s;hort time, and from this re|&s;ervoir the water was di&s;tributed all over the hou&s;e. On the &s;tair-ca&s;e, at every landing-place, was a bra&s;s cock, with two leather buckets, &s;o that in ca&s;e of fire water could be carried to any part. The leads on the top &s;erved for an ob&s;ervatory, and had a complete collection of mathematical in&s;truments. He had a water-work which chimed a &s;et of mu&s;ical bells, and a machine for forcing a loaded waggon up hill, by the help of water.</P>
<P>The Elector's country &s;eat at Konig&s;tein, about 13 miles from Dre&s;den, &s;tands on a rock, cut &s;o &s;teep that it appears quite perpendicular; it is a fortre&s;s, and the fort in many places has projections or ba&s;tions which command the &s;ides of the rock. Wood and other nece&s;&s;aries are rai&s;ed up to the fort by cranes. Konig&s;tein is always &s;tocked with provi&s;ions for 26 years. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of only 150 men, but on the fir&s;t alarm the neighbouring villages are obliged to furni&s;h &s;ome hundreds more. This place, how|ever &s;trong and otherwi&s;e &s;erviceable for &s;ecuring the archives and other things of value in ca&s;e of emer|gency,
<PB N="175" REF="192">
is not &s;ufficient to cover the country or annoy the enemy: on the top of the rock is a large green area, a wood and &s;everal gardens, in which are 38 different kinds of fore&s;t and fruit trees. It takes half an hour to walk round the ramparts. The fortre&s;s is provided with five ci&s;terns or &s;mall ponds, as re&s;er|voirs for &s;now and rain-water, and in them are &s;everal kinds of fi&s;h for the governor's u&s;e. The water which the garri&s;on drinks is drawn up by a wheel from a well 900 Dre&s;den ells deep. The &s;inking of this well was a work of 40 years, before a &s;ufficient quantity of wa|ter could be obtained, which &s;tands at pre&s;ent 18 ells deep. I ob&s;erved, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> that when a pitcher of water was poured down the well, it was 45 &s;econds be|fore it reached the &s;urface of the water. It is always kept clean, and a machine is contrived to let down workmen to repair or clean it. In this fort is a wine|ca&s;k, which took three years making; it is 17 Dre&s;|den ells long, and its diameter at the bung, 12 ells. It con&s;i&s;ts of 157 &s;taves, eight inches thick, and 54 boards for the heads; each head weighs 77&frac12; cwt. The ca&s;k was filled in 1725 with 6000 quintals of good Mei&s;&s;en wine, which co&s;t above 40,000 ducats, or &pound;.6000 &s;terling, reckoning the quart only 3d&frac12;. Engli&s;h. It holds 3,709 hog&s;heads of Dre&s;den mea|&s;ure. Till this was made, the tun of Heidelberg was reckoned the large&s;t in the world, but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s at Konig|&s;tein contains 649 hog&s;heads more. The top of this ca&s;k is railed in, and affords room for 15 or 20 per|&s;ons

to &s;it and regale them&s;elves. The Konig&s;tein ca&s;k lies in a vault, as in a temple of <HI>Bacchus.</HI></P>
<P>The town does not &s;eem to be peopled in propor|tion to the ground it &s;tands on. The number of in|habitants is e&s;timated at 50,000; though the fact is, that it lo&s;t near a third of the people &s;ince the break|ing out of the Sile&s;ian war, and the death of king <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> Provi&s;ions are dear; and few men of large fortunes are to be met with here. The arti|ficers are extremely pinched, and find it difficult to provide the nece&s;&s;aries of life by their indu&s;try, as the wages of trade&s;men are very low. And, notwith|&s;tanding all the&s;e di&s;advantages, this &s;ingle town con|tains more manufacturers and u&s;eful arti&s;ts than all Bavaria be&s;ides. Several fabrics of woollen cloth, &s;erges, &s;ilks, &amp;c. are well wrought here.</P>
<P>The opera and theatres here are in the &s;ame &s;tate as all other public amu&s;ements which require expence. The inhabitants are too oeconomical to pay for an en|tertainment, which the court formerly gave them for nothing, and the lo&s;s of which is ea&s;ily made up by the charms of their private &s;ocieties. Rural theatres, where children act, flouri&s;h much more here than the rational one does.</P>
<P>In the late Elector's time this court was, perhaps, the mo&s;t brilliant in Europe. The court-band of
<PB N="177" REF="194">
mu&s;ic, the opera, and the dancers alone, were &s;up|po&s;ed to co&s;t the Elector, yearly, upwards of 780,000 French livres, or upward of 34,000l. &s;terling. His table, &s;tables and his hunters, were all in the &s;ame &s;tile of expence. Strangers u&s;ed to flow here from all countries to partake of this magnificence; and Dre&s;den was the rendezvous of the north for ta&s;te and refined living. The numerous followers of the court, and the great number of &s;trangers, occa&s;ioned an ex|ten&s;ive circulation of money, and made all the arts alive. Amid the intoxication of pro&s;perity, the mi|ni&s;ter adopted a plan of operations, which it was im|po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould &s;ee the end of; and which left him at the di&s;cretion of the more powerful monarch, with whom he entered into a league again&s;t a dangerous neighbour.</P>
<P>The Saxons entered into an alliance with Ru&s;&s;ia, then formidable to Poland; they attached them&s;elves to Au&s;tria, and endeavoured to weaken the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia fell on the country, as <HI>Charles</HI> XII. had fallen upon Poland under <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> II. and their army, which was 17,000 &s;trong, and was expected to do wonders, &s;urrendered without &s;triking a &s;troke.</P>
<P>The manners, and way of living of the people in this city, is quite oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of the re&s;t of Ger|many. Finer &s;hapes&punc; more animated countenances,
<PB N="178" REF="195">
ea&s;ier and le&s;s con&s;trained motions, general courte&s;y, univer&s;al cleanline&s;s, are the features which charac|terize the people of this place. The ladies, in &s;hort, are hand&s;ome. I recollect, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> that an Au|&s;trian lady made the following an&s;wer to a gentleman who was extolling the Saxon women in her company. "Give us only," &s;aid &s;he, "as hand&s;ome and &s;trong built men as the Saxons are, and we will take care of the re&s;t."</P>
<P>Eating and drinking do not go forwards here quite &s;o bri&s;kly as in the &s;outhern parts of Germany; the broth here is &s;o thin, the meat &s;ent up to table &s;o cold, and always &s;o &s;lender, that an inhabitant of Vienna could not make &s;hift to live a month with a family in the middling ranks of life here. There is even, in the be&s;t hou&s;es, a par&s;imonious attention to the cel|lar and kitchen, which, in Au&s;tria and Bavaria, would pa&s;s for poverty.</P>
<P>This rigid oeconomy extends to every article of hou&s;keeping; the only appearance of expence is in that of dre&s;s, which is carried farther here than in the &s;outh of Germany. Every per&s;on of the middle cla&s;s of life, nay, of the lower one, men, as well as wo|men, dre&s;s according to the fa&s;hion; whereas, at Vienna, Munich, and &s;ome other places, there is a kind of national dre&s;s, which per&s;ons, even of the better kind, conform to.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="196">The contra&s;t between the women of the two coun|tries is equally &s;triking. Tho&s;e of the &s;outhern parts of Germany have nothing but their beauty; but the&s;e have beauty and animation too; they appear, how|ever, &s;oon to fade; and there are few women pa&s;t thirty, without &s;ome marks of old age. The Bava|rian women, perhaps, excel the&s;e of Dre&s;den in com|plexion; but the latter are much better made, and their countenances are much more intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Dre&s;den &s;uffered much when attacked by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia in 1759; and the wretched citizens were expo&s;ed to a continued cannonade and bombardment. Churches, fine buildings, and whole &s;treets, were laid in a&s;hes. Many of the hou&s;es &s;till lie in rubbi&s;h; but the inhabitants are gradually rebuilding; and, pro|bably, all the ruined &s;treets will be repaired before a new war breaks out in Germany. No fortified town &s;hould have palaces or &s;uburbs; and it would be for|tunate for the proprietors of e&s;tates in Dre&s;den, if they were allowed to de&s;troy the fortifications; the&s;e fine buildings would then be in little danger of being overthrown.</P>
<P>The late Count Bruhl's magnificent man&s;ion, now belongs to the Elector; and his fine collection of paintings were &s;old to the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia for 150,000 rix-dollars; they &s;ay, here, that the Count had, at lea&s;t, 300 different &s;uits of cloaths; of each of

the&s;e he had a duplicate, as he always &s;hifted his clothes after dinner, and did not chu&s;e that his dre&s;s &s;hould appear different in the afternoon from what it had been in the morning. A painting of each &s;uit, with the particular cane and &s;nuff-box belonging to it, was very accurately drawn in a large book, and pre&s;ented to his excellency every morning, that he might fix upon the dre&s;s in which he wi&s;hed to appear for the day. This mini&s;ter was accu&s;ed of having accumu|lated a great fortune.</P>
<P>There is at Dre&s;den a very ingenious foundery for bells and cannon. The fine arts of painting and &s;culpture are well performed in this place. Needle|work and lace are articles for which this city is famed all over Europe. The commerce of the town is con|&s;iderable for the works of art it produces.</P>
<P>But the &s;ilver that is brought from the mines at Fridburg every fifteenth day, and reduced to a regu|lar coinage for the benefit of the proprietors, is a great article of general utility here. The rea&s;on which may be a&s;&s;igned for it, is on account of its vir|gin purity, being &s;even per cent better than our En|gli&s;h &s;tandard; con&s;equently, an advantageous trade may be followed by the merchants, in this &s;ingle branch of exportation, to other countries. The pro|duce of the whole of the mines may now be e&s;ti|mated at 10,000l. a month.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="198">The chief religion of the inhabitants is Lutherani&s;m; but there are profe&s;&s;ors of all denominations; and the clog of &s;uper&s;tition &s;eems to be here intirely done away.</P>
<P>The Saxon troops have a very martial appearance. The men, in general, are very hand&s;ome and well made. Neither they nor their officers are &s;o very up|right and &s;tiff in their manner as the Ru&s;&s;ians. They are like the Engli&s;h, who are &s;oldiers only when in action; and are as brave as any thing you can call brave; but, at this time of day, bravery alone is not &s;ufficient. They tell you a &s;tory of them, which would appear ridiculous in the eyes of a Pru&s;&s;ian or Au&s;trian commander; but which mu&s;t recommend them to a friend of human nature and a citizen of the world. The officers of a Saxon regiment of dragoons, which made part of the army that fought again&s;t Prince <HI>Henry</HI> of Pru&s;&s;ia in Bohemia, took an oath, <HI>&s;ub dio,</HI> that they would put to death any of their number who &s;hould run away in action. The Saxon army is 25,000 &s;trong. The uniform of the guards is red and yellow; that of the marching regiments white. The &s;oldiers, during the &s;ummer, wear only wai&s;tcoats, even when they mount guard, and always appear neat and clean; the &s;erjeants, be&s;ides their other arms, have a large pi&s;tol; this is &s;o commo|diou&s;ly fa&s;tened to the left &s;ide, as to give no trouble.

<P>Dr. <HI>Brown</HI> ingeniou&s;ly gives a de&s;cription of the mines of Friburg, which, he &s;ays, lie remarkably deep, and produce &s;uch rich ore, that it yields 65 pounds of &s;ilver for every 112 pounds of it. The&s;e mines, &s;ince they were opened, have produced, ac|cording to the mo&s;t authentic accounts, upwards of 30 millions &s;terling.</P>
<P>The method of di&s;covering mines, as practi&s;ed here, mu&s;t gratify the curious reader, therefore we &s;hall lay before him what two authors of known ve|racity, Dr. <HI>Brown</HI> and Dr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> declare, and they were eye-witne&s;&s;es to the experiment.</P>
<P>A per&s;on took in his hand a hazel &s;tick, forked at the end, which he carried horizontally, whil&s;t he walked over the ground; and, on his cro&s;&s;ing a place where ore lay under the &s;urface of the earth, the &s;tick changed its po&s;ition by turning in his hand; whereupon he marked the &s;pot, and then proceeded further, and as often as there was ore in his way, the &s;ame thing was experienced by the experimentali&s;t.</P>
<P>The working of the&s;e mines is very dangerous to the workmen, who frequently meet with damps that
<PB N="183" REF="200">
prove mortal. Another inconveniency is, that the du&s;t of the ore cankers and frets the &s;kin, lungs and &s;tomach, and brings them into irrecoverable con|&s;umptions: to &s;ave them&s;elves again&s;t which, they frequently wear ma&s;ks with gla&s;s eyes.</P>
<P>The mines are cold, as far as the air can penetrates but afterwards warm enough.</P>
<P>The Saxons have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their &s;kill in mining all over Europe. Their &s;trong bodies, their indefatigable indu&s;try, and their good under|&s;tanding, particularly qualify them for this kind of employ, which is the mo&s;t complicated and laborious of all human occupations, and which requires the greate&s;t variety of knowledge to bring to perfection.</P>
<P>Ey&s;leben is the principal city of Mansfeldt county, and is famous for its giving birth to that eminent character, Dr. <HI>Martin Luther,</HI> in 1483, who died here in 1564.</P>
<P>As we boa&s;t of Saxon original in this country, I have endeavoured to di&s;play the character of the people, in a comprehen&s;ive manner, &s;o that the rea|der may ea&s;ily compare the one with the other, and judge of the copy from the original. But, that the former has the advantage by the poli&s;h and graceful|ne&s;s
<PB N="184" REF="201">
of manners, from his &s;ituation in a land of free|dom, I doubt not will be readily admitted.</P>
<P>Hunting is the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of this electorate, and a fatal pa&s;&s;ion it is; for the rational inhabitants are more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by it than the brutes. In the hard winter &s;ome years ago, it was computed that above 30,000 head of deer died in the Duke's dominions; and yet in the open lands and fore&s;ts there is now &s;up|po&s;ed to be upwards of that number, none of which are to be de&s;troyed by the inhabitants under the pe|nalty of being condemned as a galley-&s;lave; and the&s;e, with the wild boars, are a great nui&s;ance to the country. In every town of note there are 50 of the inhabitants to watch, five every night by rotation, and ring hand-bells every quarter of an hour, to frighten the deer, and defend their corn from the in|cur&s;ions of &s;o formidable an enemy.</P>
<P>This ill-timed pa&s;&s;ion, joined to a fooli&s;h re&s;pect for the cu&s;tom of their forefathers, thus induces the Electors of Saxony to violate the property of their &s;ubjects, at the &s;ame time they depart from the true ends of government, and con&s;equently from the true happine&s;s which they fondly &s;eek by &s;uch gratificati|ons.</P>
<P>The adjacent country to the electoral palace, near Me&s;&s;ein is highly proper for the &s;port; and the dogs

and hor&s;es are kept in order, being exerci&s;ed twice a week. The hunting equipage of the Saxon court is very gay and brilliant, a uniform of yellow cloth laced with &s;ilver, being worn on the&s;e occa&s;ions by every one who appears in the field.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the &s;malle&s;t villages in the Saxon mountains, though often &s;hut out from the world by hills on each &s;ide, are more poli&s;hed, better bred, and more alive than tho&s;e of the large&s;t towns in the &s;outh of Germany.</P>
<P>Reading is almo&s;t univer&s;al in this country, &s;ocia|bility and ho&s;pitality accompany and encourage the harde&s;t labour. Even the &s;ocieties of the inferior ranks are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the liberality, knowledge of the world, wit and jollity, to be met with in them. The women are throughout remarkable for the beauty of their &s;hapes, the animation of their looks, and their infinite &s;pirit, ea&s;e and vivacity, and yet they are quite good natured, and admirable hou&s;e-wives. The men have of late, indeed, began to complain a little, that, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, their beautiful partners have been too much addicted to vanity, but their clamours would &s;oon cea&s;e, if the women were to unite and make a law, that every eighth or tenth man &s;hould take an Au&s;trian or Bavarian wife for the edification of the whole community. For my part, &s;ays Baron <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> the article of dre&s;s alone excepted, I have
<PB N="186" REF="203">
not been able to di&s;cern a &s;ingle excre&s;cence which wants pruning; whereas the Bavarian and Au&s;trian women, be&s;ides being full as fond of dre&s;s, break out a little both at bed and board, and do not concern them&s;elves at all with dome&s;tic matters.</P>
<P>Con&s;picuous as the indu&s;try and commerce of the people is, the &s;ituation of the farmer among&s;t them is truly to be pitied. This is owing to the quantity of land in the hands of great farmers. Along the foot of the Ertzgeberg mountain, and in the plain, the vil|lages on all &s;ides are &s;o numerous that you can hardly count the &s;teeples. Tho&s;e in the electoral territory, taking in the Lau&s;its, amount to near &s;ix thou&s;and. I &s;aw &s;everal farmers ploughing with one ox and one cow, many have only a cow, that &s;erves them for milk and to plough with. It is true the &s;oil is very light, but no farmer can do well with &s;o little cattle. Great part of them live upon potatoes, cabbage, and tur|neps; &s;eldom is meat &s;een at their tables. But they all drink coffee, and the profu&s;e u&s;e they make of it is a &s;trong contra&s;t to their penuriou&s;ne&s;s in other re|&s;pects. It is made in large pots, but &s;o weak as to have &s;carcely the colour of the berry. Their cleanli|ne&s;s, however, in the mid&s;t of their poverty, is re|markable.</P>
<P>Throughout the whole level country, even the common people &s;peak good German, and excepting
<PB N="187" REF="204">
on the mountains, &s;o do the farmers. Some miles from Leip&s;ic I vi&s;ited a gentleman, continues the Baron, on his e&s;tate, for whom I had letters from Dre&s;den, and I thought my&s;elf in a &s;chool of pa&s;toral felicity, and &s;hall ever con&s;ider the few days I pa&s;&s;ed with him as &s;ome of the happie&s;t in my life. The e&s;tates of the&s;e gentlemen are &s;mall; as the Saxon nobility, in general, are as poor as they are numerous, but it is to this very poverty that they owe their happine&s;s. They under&s;tand how to unite the beautiful with the u&s;eful, ta&s;te with &s;implicity, economy with various amu&s;e|ments, and nature with art; in &s;uch a manner as to make that bu&s;ine&s;s, which other men look upon as a puni&s;hment, a &s;ource of endle&s;s and uninterrupted fe|licity. They reli&s;h plea&s;ures as Epicureans do rich wines, which they keep a long while on the palate, in order to reli&s;h the flavour; they under&s;tand how to mix the amu&s;ements and the occupations of the coun|try, &s;o as to make them follow each other in agreeable &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;o well, that it is worth while to come among them to read <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Georgics, which I am per&s;uaded cannot be read any where el&s;e with &s;o much plea&s;ure. Fi&s;hing is with them a very weighty and important bu&s;ine&s;s, and no where have they brought the art to greater perfection. They have &s;e|parate ponds, in which fi&s;h are kept according to their age, and with different intentions. The&s;e ponds are in fallow lands, which at certain times are broke up and ploughed again, &s;o that the e&s;tate reaps thus a
<PB N="188" REF="205">
double advantage, they fill their lands with great judg|ment, and &s;tudy the art of planting beyond other na|tions. Saxon wool next to Spani&s;h and Engli&s;h is the be&s;t in Europe, and &s;o on.</P>
<P>To &s;uch various practical and theoretical improve|ments of their lands, do the nobility add &s;mall walks, vi&s;its to their friends in town or country, collections of nature and art, and attention to improve the &s;chools of their di&s;tricts, poetry and mu&s;ic. The rich, I mean tho&s;e who have from 800l. to 1000l.a year, Engli&s;h, (mo&s;t have only from 80l. to 100l.) come to town for only one or two months in the year. Their daughters are the clevere&s;t and livelie&s;t creatures in the world. Their natural &s;en&s;ibility contracts a romantic turn in the &s;tillne&s;s of the country, which appears in their conver&s;ation and actions, and leads them to take unguarded &s;teps in the fir&s;t years of their life. Unequal marriages and elopements, of cour&s;e, are extremely frequent here. In Swabia, Bavaria, and Au&s;tria, I met, &s;ays the &s;ame author, with Saxon girls of good family, who in the la&s;t Sile|&s;ian war had enli&s;ted with officers of the Imperial and Circle armies, and who all made excellent wives and mothers. The country girls have not in general great liveline&s;s or much coquetry. They are pen&s;ive and tender, and all of them are as hand&s;ome as angels. The kind of reading in fa&s;hion in Germany, which is chiefly novels and romances, is no proper improve|ment
<PB N="189" REF="206">
for the ladies of Saxony, who are, by nature, of &s;uch inflammable con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>The Court cannot make the &s;malle&s;t law without the con&s;ent of the &s;tates; the&s;e are made up of three orders, viz. the &s;piritualities, noblemen, and gentry; and they compo&s;e a &s;ort of diet; for the power of the Elector is confined to their direction.</P>
<P>The revenue of this country amounts to 1,100,000l per annum. The taxes are all appropriated by the &s;tates to &s;pecific purpo&s;es; nor can the Elector make any alteration in the de&s;tination of them, without their con&s;ent. He has his own privy pur&s;e, to the &s;upply of which particular revenues are al&s;o appointed.</P>
<P>The indu&s;try of the natives makes this circle one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable in Germany, for they neither want food or cloathing; even the very lowe&s;t among them makes an ample provi&s;ion by his a&s;&s;iduity and atten|tion to the calling he has been brought up in. A pea&s;ant will carry a couple of hundred weight of pro|vi&s;ions to market eight or ten miles, in a wheelbarrow adapted to his u&s;e, and return to his home, having di&s;po&s;ed of his commodity, and all in good time to breakfa&s;t! Hence we may infer that the Saxons are not an indolent people, but on the contrary an active, indu&s;trious race of men.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="207">Before we di&s;mi&s;s this article, we &s;hall remark, that from the di&s;po&s;ition of the natives to &s;trangers, are hi&s;|toric traits of narrative frequently drawn; which is a &s;ource pregnant with danger, and for the mo&s;t part full of erroneous principles.</P>
<P>The Saxons are hone&s;t, blunt, and fair in their dealings and conver&s;ation: therefore a traveller will be &s;ome time before he arrives at a knowledge of their natural propen&s;ities and di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>It is a fact well known in our own country, that the art of retailing fal&s;ehood is become a practice reduced to &s;cientific principles, though we pique our&s;elves on being nationally frank, and re&s;olve the queries of fo|reigners without re&s;erve, and in an open hone&s;ty, pe|culiar to our country. Yet many needy pillars of &s;tate, have their tale-bearer to the duns at the door, who&s;e chief employment is to a&s;&s;ert in the forenoon <HI>"his ma&s;ter's not up,"</HI>&mdash;in the afternoon <HI>"he is out,"</HI> in the evening <HI>in company and at dinner,"</HI>&mdash; but at night the deluded crowd are informed &mdash; the de&s;ired object <HI>"is gone to the play&mdash;ball&mdash;ma&s;querade, &amp;c."</HI> and will only be home with the new born day, then to &s;ucceed!

<P>LOWER Saxony comprehends Hol&s;tein N. Dit|mar&s;h W. Stomaria S. and Wagerland E. &s;ubject partly to the king of Denmark, and partly to the duke of Hol&s;tein Gottorp; Hamburg, a &s;ove|reign &s;tate; Mecklenburg Schwerin, and Strelitz, &s;ubject to their dukes; Hilde&s;heim, &s;ubject to its bi&s;hop; Magdeburg and Halber&s;tadt, &s;ubject to Pru&s;&s;ia; Brun&s;wick Wolfenbuttle, &s;ubject to its duke, and Brun&s;wick Lunenburg, Hanover, Bremen, Verden, &amp;c. &s;ubject to the king of England, as elector of Hanover. Of Dani&s;h Hol&s;tein, and the Pru&s;&s;ian ter|ritories, we have already &s;poken; of the re&s;t we will now &s;peak.</P>
<P>The northern divi&s;ion of Germany comprehends the upper and lower circles of Germany, which are bounded by the Baltic Sea, Denmark, and the Ger|man Ocean, on the North; by Poland and Sile&s;ia, on the Ea&s;t, by Bohemia, Franconia, and the Langra|vate of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el on the South, and by the circle of We&s;tphalia on the We&s;t; &s;ituate between 8 and 18
<PB N="192" REF="210">
deg. of E. long and between 50 and 55 deg. of N. latitude.</P>
<P>As to the duchy of Magdeburg, and the principa|lity of Halber&s;tadt, which are u&s;ually reckoned to be contiguous to, and are incorporated with, the other dominions of the elector of Brandenburg, we &s;hall not con&s;ider them here, having treated &s;ufficiently of them when &s;peaking of Pru&s;&s;ia. This circle is bounded by the German Ocean, Denmark, and the Baltic Sea, towards the North; by Pomerania, and the Marqui&s;ate of Brandenburg, towards the Ea&s;t; by the territories of the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, on the South; and by the circle of We&s;tphalia towards the We&s;t, extending in length from Ea&s;t to We&s;t 200 miles, and from North to South 190. The winters here are long, and air exceedingly cold; but the coun|try produces corn in many places and does not want rich pa&s;tures.</P>
<P>The Duchy of Mecklenburg, which includes the territories of the two families of Schwerin, and Stre|litz, and the Swedi&s;h town of Wi&s;mar, is bounded by the Baltic Sea on the North, by Pomerania, on the Ea&s;t, Brandenburgh on the South, and Lunenburg towards the We&s;t. It is computed to be from 24 to 30 German miles long, with a breadth of nine, ten, and eighteen.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="211">This country has the advantage of the Baltic Sea for many miles, be&s;ides great number of rivers and large lakes, which is one rea&s;on that the air is un|healthful in &s;ummer; and its northern &s;ituation ren|ders it intolerable cold in the winter.</P>
<P>According to the remon&s;trance of the nobility in 1718, to the Imperial court again&s;t the contributions required of them, the whole duchy is full of large and &s;mall lakes, from one to three German miles long, and from one to one and a half broad, yielding little or no|thing. There are likewi&s;e large and de&s;olate heaths here, with moors, woods, fens, and quarries. One half of the country con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;andy &s;oil, which when well dre&s;&s;ed, will produce, only a little rye and oats; and the pa&s;tures, compared with tho&s;e of Hol|&s;tein and Pomerania, are very indifferent; of the other arable lands when well manured, a third bears barley, but produces very little wheat. In general the &s;oil is light and &s;andy, and yields only four for one. But the fact is, according to <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> quite dif|ferent. The land is incomparable, and nothing in Hol&s;tein or Pomerania can exceed it; and, when well manured, produces not only four-fold, but ge|nerally five, &s;ix, or eight. The country is inter|&s;per&s;ed with delightful eminences, very plea&s;ant and profitable woods, and good fruit-trees. The lakes and rivers yield large revenues, abounding in fi&s;h, and the whole duchy has been much improved, and is &s;till
<PB N="194" REF="212">
capable of greater improvement. Many of the nobi|lity here have received the value of their lands double and treble. In it are al&s;o &s;ome &s;alt &s;prings, with al|lum, iron, and copper. According to e&s;timation in 1628, the farms in the whole country amount|ed to 2496. The nobility are accounted a free &s;tate, and enjoy very con&s;iderable privileges. The pea&s;ants are under villenage.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are Lutherans. There are &s;ome Calvini&s;t congregations, and in Schwerin the Roman-catholics are permited the private exerci&s;e of their wor&s;hip. The towns have grammar-&s;chools, and at Ro&s;tock is a univer&s;ity. The country is not without woollen-manufacturers, tanners, leather-dre&s;&s;ers, to|bacco-&s;pinners, and other trades, but the number of them is not &s;ufficient. Its exports are corn, flax, hemp, hops, wax, honey, cattle, butter, chee&s;e, wool, and &s;everal kinds of wood.</P>
<P>The Duke of Mecklenberg Schwerin, has, by vir|tue of the duchies of Schwerin and Gu&s;tro, two votes at the diets among the princes. The annual revenues of this dukedom is 300,000 rix-dollars, and tho&s;e of the Duke of Strelitz, between 70 and 80,000 rix-dollars.</P>
<P>The duchy is generally divided into &s;ix parts, wherein are 45 cities and towns. The chief of which are tho&s;e of Schwerin and Gu&s;tro. The former is
<PB N="195" REF="213">
the capital of the circle of that name, and the u&s;ual re&s;idence of the Duke, being plea&s;antly &s;ituated on a lake, which partly &s;urrounds the town, abounding with a variety of fi&s;h. The city is neat and well built. The Duke's palace &s;tands on an i&s;land in the lake, being fortified and communicating with the town by means of a bridge. Some parts of it command a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The collection of paintings in this palace is very valuable, and its gardens laid out in a fine ta&s;te, to the greate&s;t advantage po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The town church is called the Domkirk, and was formerly the cathedral of the &s;ee of Schwerin, which is now reduced to a temporality, and bears the name of a Dukedom.</P>
<P>Gu&s;tro is the capital of the circle of that name, &s;itu|ated in the principality of Wender, on the little river Nebel, and is one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t plea|&s;ant towns in the whole country, as al&s;o the &s;eat of the chief courts of judicature, and a &s;uperintendancy.</P>
<P>In this town there is a fine palace belonging to the Prince, and in the church belonging to it lies the vault of the ducal family. It likewi&s;e contains a ca|thedral and one pari&s;h church.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="214">Though Mechlenberg is a level country, it is not without &s;ome pretty land&s;capes, where &s;oft eminences are beautified with a great variety of woods; where we &s;ee meadows covered with flowers, and little cottages &s;urrounding &s;mall lakes, all forming very plea&s;ing pictures. Then as to their countrymen, the Mechlenberg farmers are a very &s;trong and healthy race of men. Their curling, white hair reminds the traveller of the old Germans who heretofore contributed to the Roman luxury; that <HI>aurea Cae&s;aries,</HI> which on the head of a thin-boned, &s;allow-faced and coughing, young &s;enator, mu&s;t have been the greate&s;t &s;atire on the corruption of Rome, in the eyes of thinking men. Almo&s;t all the farmers in Mechlenberg are &s;laves; but then their fate is not &s;o hard as it &s;eems, the nobility being humane, en|lightened and good-natured. But the&s;e, as well as the burge&s;&s;es of certain cities, enjoy a freedom here which has been lo&s;t in Upper Germany. The dukes of Mechlenberg and the electors of Saxony, are the mo&s;t limited princes of the empire; nor have any decrees at the Imperial court, which they have brought forward in their &s;everal contentions with their &s;tates, yet been able to humble their nobility, who&s;e jealou&s;y of the power of their governors &s;ometimes amounts to an almo&s;t ridiculous exce&s;s.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this, in a company of Mech|lenberg noble&s;&s;e, the &s;ociety is very agreeable. It is
<PB N="197" REF="215">
true, we meet with no academicians, no abb&eacute;s, no virtuo&s;i, no journali&s;ts, no players, nor any of the characters which contribute &s;o much to enliven con|ver&s;ation; but, on the other hand, we meet with &s;ound under&s;tanding and good hearts, which give &s;ocial intercour&s;e a &s;tronger and more &s;ub&s;tantial re|li&s;h than all the anecdotes and <HI>hi&s;toriettes de cour,</HI> co|medies, <HI>brochures,</HI> and all other artificial ragouts, with which &s;o much a&s;&s;afoetida is mixed.</P>
<P>I have &s;een no noble&s;&s;e happier, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> or more ho&s;pitable than tho&s;e of Mechlenberg; and <HI>Nu|gent</HI> was in raptures with the attention and reception he met with. Their tables are wonderfully well co|vered, and they are tolerably well acquainted with the life of courts. Literature is found among all ranks above the populace. The women know nothing of what is called <HI>Ton;</HI> that is to &s;ay, they have none of that boldne&s;s and imperiou&s;ne&s;s, nor yet any thing of that de&s;ire of conque&s;t in our countrywomen. They are gentle and attentive to their children, &s;till and ba&s;hful; but all they &s;ay is &s;o <HI>naif</HI> and hearty, that, compared to it, the wit of Pari&s;ian dames appears loath|&s;ome and flat.</P>
<P>At New Strelitz is a palace belonging to the Duke; near which a genteel town has been built, &s;ince the year 1733. The old town, called Strelitz, it is in|tended
<PB N="198" REF="216">
&s;hall in time be joined, by elegant buildings, to this new one.</P>
<P>The title a&s;&s;umed by both the Dukes of Schewrin and Strelitz, is Duke of Mechlenberg, Prince of Wenden, Schwerin and Ratzburg, &amp;c. There is &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting two lines of the Dukes of Mechlenberg. The Schwerin line commenced in 1695, and the Gu&s;tro line having failed, the Schwerin line laid claim to it, but the Duke of Strelitz oppo&s;ed it. In 1701, this conte&s;t was adju&s;ted at Hamburg by an agreement, importing that the principality of Gu&s;tro &s;hould be added to the principality of Schwerin; and the principality of Ratzburg and county of Stargard, be added to the principality of Strelitz, with &s;everal commendaries and tolls. At the &s;ame time the right of primogeniture&s;hip and lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in both hou&s;es, and the compact ratified by the Emperor. This latter branch has, in the per&s;on of our mo&s;t gracious queen, given us an excellent prince&s;s.</P>
<P>Wi&s;mar, and its dependant villages, formerly be|longed to the duchy of Schwerin; but, at the peace of We&s;tphalia, in 1648, were ceded to the crown of Sweden.

<P>The province or duchy of Hol&s;tein, including the Lord&s;hip of Pinnenberg, is &s;eparated, towards the north, from Sle&s;wic and Denmark; the Baltick &s;ea to the ea&s;t; Lavenburg we&s;t; and the German ocean to the &s;outh. It is divided between the King of Denmark and Great Duke of Hol&s;tein Gottorf. The King of Denmark, for his &s;hare, &s;ends a &s;tadt|holder to Gluck&s;tadt, and has a voice in the diet of the empire.</P>
<P>Its &s;ituation, between the Baltick and the German ocean, expo&s;es it to frequent &s;torms: which, if they purify the air, occa&s;ion al&s;o a heavy expence to the di&s;tricts along the German ocean and the Elbe; for the inhabitants, to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the inun|dations which they have cau&s;e to dread in &s;tormy weather, are obliged to rai&s;e &s;trong dykes, and to &s;ecure them con&s;tantly for their per&s;onal &s;afety.</P>
<P>The land is excellent in its kind, producing every &s;ort of bread-corn, vegetables and nutritive herbs; by which means it affords fine breeds of cattle, &s;trong and healthy.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="219">In this country are found fi&s;h-ponds of a very &s;in|gular nature, abounding with carp, lampreys, pikes and perch, for two or three years; but which, every third or fourth year, are drawn and drained, and the fi&s;h &s;old; after which the pond, for &s;ome years, is &s;own with oats and u&s;ed as pa&s;ture-land; then again, laid under water and &s;tored with fi&s;h. This is a mo&s;t lucrative piece of oeconomy. Throughout the duchy there are no hills which can be properly &s;o called.</P>
<P>This country is not without &s;everal manufactures and fabrics, particularly in the towns of Altena and Gluck&s;tadt, but the&s;e might be con&s;iderably aug|mented. Hamburg and Lubeck &s;upply the inhabi|tants with mo&s;t foreign commodities. The principal inland trading towns are Altena, Gluck&s;tadt and Kiel. Its exports are grain, malt, fine wheat, peas, beans, rape-&s;eed, horned cattle, &s;heep, rams, &s;wine, hor&s;es, poultry, butter, chee&s;e, veni&s;on and fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Hol&s;tein has an order of knighthood, that of Saint Anne, a red enamelled cro&s;s worn pendant, at a red ribbon edged with yellow, from the left &s;houlder to the right &s;ide. The &s;eat of the Great Duke's privy council and regency is Kiel.</P>
<P>Hol&s;tein is &s;till a part of Germany; yet <HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> tells us, that he no &s;ooner got a few po&s;ts beyond the Eyder, which is the natural boundary between Ger|many

<P>The Danes are, at lea&s;t, a century behind mo&s;t of the prote&s;tant &s;tates of Germany. They are the mo&s;t melancholy, mo&s;t untractable and mo&s;t clowni&s;h peo|ple, continues the Baron, I ever &s;aw. Their debau|chery, bigotry and brutality, di&s;tingui&s;h them &s;o much from the greater part of the Germans, that it is only nece&s;&s;ary to be among&s;t them to be convinced of the inefficacy of religion alone to make men better, when other favourable circum&s;tances do not concur. There are, it is true, enlightened men among the prie&s;ts of this country; but, in general, they are as proud, as intolerant, and as ignorant as Spani&s;h prie&s;ts: I &s;aw &s;ome of them who were likewi&s;e very like the Spani&s;h prie&s;ts in outward appearance. They wore their &s;pectacles over the no&s;e, held up their heads, drew back the body, &s;poke through the no&s;e and throat, and &s;trutted ju&s;t like the prie&s;ts at Barce|lona and Sarago&s;&s;a. When they &s;it down to preach, they do it, as if they were in labour with the &s;alvation of mankind. I vi&s;ited one of them who pa&s;&s;es for a great botani&s;t, though he knows nothing more than the medicinal plants of his own country; he was &s;tu|dying his &s;ermon for the next Sunday. It was long a matter of doubt, whether or no he would give me an audience. After having conver&s;ed for about half an
<PB N="202" REF="221">
hour upon the wind and weather, with his two daughters, the &s;illie&s;t and mo&s;t uninformed creatures I had ever &s;een; who, out of real or affected mode&s;ty, never tru&s;ted them&s;elves to look in my face; out come their bulky and yellow-coloured mother, from the &s;tudy of her lord and hu&s;band, to a&s;&s;ure me that he was extremely bu&s;y about his Sunday's di&s;cour&s;e, which would, however, only take him up another hour, after which I &s;hould have the honour of &s;moke|ing a pipe with him. I was, for &s;ome minutes, in doubt whether I &s;hould accept of this honour or not. It rather hurt my pride to think that I was de&s;tined to &s;erve a clowni&s;h prie&s;t for the <HI>vehiculum</HI> to his &s;moking, and would have gone away; but, recol|lecting that had I been among the Hottentots, I &s;hould have been obliged to pay re&s;pect to the cu&s;|toms of the country, I determined to wait. After &s;ome time, the <HI>penetrole</HI> was opened; and I beheld my hero, a &s;hort, &s;quat, fat figure, the <HI>Trulliber</HI> of &s;cience, enthroned amid a labyrinth of books, and enveloped with clouds of &s;moke which &s;carce al|lowed me to &s;ee his face. In three or four minutes our conver&s;ation was at an end; I tried him every way; but no tone I was ma&s;ter of could bring a word from him in return. At la&s;t, after having ob&s;erved him|&s;elf that &s;moking rather &s;poiled conver&s;ation, he took up his &s;ermon that he had been penning, and read me a page or two, by way of enlivening it. Of this I did not hear a word, as the &s;moke of his tobacco

puffed under my no&s;e, took away my re&s;piration and obliged me to attend to &s;elf pre&s;ervation; but he was determined I &s;hould not get off thus, and &s;o pro|po&s;ed to open what he called his trea&s;ure. This was a che&s;t that contained all the &s;ermons he had ever written, making, in all, eight or ten thick folio vo|lumes. When he took out the fir&s;t, a cold &s;weat ran down my &s;houlders, which making him apprehen&s;ive that he might kill his patient, he a&s;&s;ured me he would only read the texts of the &s;ermons from the table of contents. I bore it with one table, with great re&s;igna|tion; but as he was taking down the &s;econd folio, took my hat and &s;tick and hurried to the door; (and when out of &s;ight of the hou&s;e, made a &s;ketch of the &s;cene for my future amu&s;ement). I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that Baron <HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> was of the Romi&s;h church, a native of Wirtemburg, and 25 years of age when in Germany.</P>
<P>In no prote&s;tant country are the prie&s;ts held in &s;uch profound reverence by the people as in Den|mark. Pride and in&s;olence in the mini&s;ters of an humble religion are &s;ure marks of little knowledge and a bad government in the place where it is found. The government of Denmark is the mo&s;t de&s;potic in the univer&s;e. This form of government has its ad|vantages and di&s;advantages; the &s;mallne&s;s of the country renders it ea&s;y to govern thus; and, on the other hand, this very circum&s;tance makes the people
<PB N="204" REF="224">
feel, more &s;everely, the weakne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion of its governors.</P>
<P>Denmark is, in truth, the &s;malle&s;t of all the Euro|pean powers; it contains &s;carce two millions of inha|bitants, Lapland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway and Hol&s;tein included. The king's income does not amount, in all, to more than 83,333l. &s;terling. He cannot cope with the elector of Saxony, and the elec|tor of Bavaria is on a footing with him. Without &s;ub&s;idies the king of Denmark is unable to maintain an army of 40,000 men, and a fleet of 20 &s;hips of the line, only for a few years.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not &s;ay more of Hol&s;tein, having men|tioned it when &s;peaking of Denmark, but proceed to the principal towns of Kiel, Hamburgh, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Kiel is the capital of the Great Duke's part of Hol|&s;tein, &s;ituated on a bay of the Baltic, with a conve|nient harbour. The place is well built; the &s;treets &s;trait and wide, but disfigured by rows of trees, which Dutch ta&s;te of <HI>rus in urbe</HI> is dete&s;table. It contains the Duke's palace and &s;ome &s;tate colleges. It has al&s;o a univer&s;ity and a con&s;i&s;tory of its own. The pro&s;perity of this place is not a little promoted by the annual re&s;ort to it, by the nobility and per&s;ons of wealth of Hol&s;tein and Sle&s;wick, for the transfer|ring and placing out their money. This pecuniary

intercour&s;e la&s;ts eight days; and at the &s;ame time, al&s;o, is held a con&s;iderable fair, which is rung in on Twelfth-day; and, on the eve of the purification, terminated by a &s;econd ringing of the &s;ame bell. It was anciently one of the Hans-towns.</P>
<P>Hamburgh is a free Imperial city, independent of any other power but the Emperor, to whom it pays homage, a Hans town of the utmo&s;t importance of any in Europe. It &s;tands on the borders of that part of Hol&s;tein called Stormar, about 70 miles from the in|flux of the Elbe into the Ocean, and properly &s;ituated on the rivers Elbe, Al&s;ter, and Bille. The Elbe at Hamburgh, including the i&s;lands on which part of the town &s;tands, is not le&s;s than four Engli&s;h miles broad, forming two &s;pacious harbours, and running through mo&s;t parts of the city in canals, which being general|ly pretty broad and deep, are of great convenience to the merchants, who&s;e hou&s;es &s;tand on them. The hou&s;es of &s;ome of the warehou&s;es are from five to &s;even &s;tories high, owing to want of cellaring: even their wines are kept in upper lofts. The merchants make their halls into ware-rooms, and they live upon the fir&s;t floor; &s;o that on entering the fir&s;t hou&s;es you find your&s;elf at once amid&s;t hog&s;heads and bales of goods; and what is full as bad, they u&s;e them al&s;o for coach-hou&s;es, and in &s;ome hou&s;es the &s;tables are under the &s;ame roof with the apartments. In the canals, as well as in the river it&s;elf, even to the di&s;tance of 12 or 16 miles above
<PB N="206" REF="226">
Hamburgh, the tide ebbs and flows twice a-day, which is &s;erviceable to the inhabitants, but &s;ubjects them to inundations, when the wind blows &s;trong at North-we&s;t, at which time the lower buildings and cellars are filled with water. There are no le&s;s than 84 bridges over the canals, many of them paved like the &s;treets, on a level with them, and hou&s;es built on each &s;ide. Within the city are 40 water-mills, &s;ix wind-mills, &s;ix &s;luices, and &s;ix large markets. The &s;treets are for the mo&s;t part of pretty con&s;iderable breadth, but the hou&s;es recommend them&s;elves more by their inward conveniences, and the gardens with which they are inter&s;per&s;ed, though more e&s;pecially &s;till by their &s;itu|ation for trade, than by any outward ornaments of architecture. Some of the&s;e &s;treets however make a grand appearance; but on the other hand &s;everal of them are very narrow and crooked, and there are &s;till a greater number of dark lanes, wherein the hou&s;es are very high, and many families live together; &s;o that the circuit of the city is by no means propor|tionate to the number of its inhabitants. The walls form nearly a circle of five miles and a half, and the number of inhabitants within this circuit exclu&s;ive of Jews, is e&s;timated at 100,000. On a calculation taken of the inhabitants of Hamburgh, compared with tho&s;e of other large cities, and made from their regi&s;ters of births and burials, they are found to be to tho&s;e of Paris, as one to four; to tho&s;e of Am&s;terdam as four to &s;even; to tho&s;e of Vienna, as eight to
<PB N="207" REF="227">
thirteen, and to tho&s;e of Copenhagen nearly on a par.</P>
<P>It is naturally to be imagined that in &s;o populous a place there mu&s;t be great numbers of poor, and this has given occa&s;ion to &s;o many public charities, that Hamburg is greatly admired by foreigners. The hou&s;e of correction is a very large building, and the per&s;ons committed to it, among whom are all who are found begging in the &s;treets, are employed in various kinds of labour, particularly in ra&s;ping Brazil and other kinds of wood. The <HI>Way&s;enhaus</HI> is a place where orphans are maintained and educated, and who&s;e revenue is 6000l. a year; the <HI>Pe&s;thof,</HI> where lunatics are confined, and the&s;e &s;ometimes to the number of one thou&s;and; the <HI>Pockenhaus,</HI> where tho&s;e are received who are afflicted with contagious di&s;or|ders; the <HI>Spenhaus,</HI> where pro&s;titutes and &s;uch like offenders are confined, and many others in&s;tituted for the relief of the de&s;erving poor, &s;o that not a beg|gar is &s;een. There is one place where children are educated gratis, and another where unmarried women may be admitted for a &s;mall &s;um and maintained du|ring life, and there is another in&s;titution for the re|demption of &s;eafaring per&s;ons taken by the cor&s;airs of Barbary, with many others no le&s;s de&s;erving of commendation. With re&s;pect to fires, &s;uch regula|tions are made, that every one knows the part he is to
<PB N="208" REF="228">
act. The town is regularly watched, and wi&s;e pre|cautions are taken to prevent fires breaking out.</P>
<P>The fortifications of this city are in the old Dutch ta&s;te, a high wall and a va&s;t ditch, made deep and wide, with &s;ome outworks of no moment, the ram|parts lofty, covered with gra&s;s and planted with trees, and &s;uch a breadth that &s;everal carriages may go a-brea&s;t. On the&s;e ramparts any one is at liberty to take the air. The garri&s;on never exceeds 2,500 men, too few by 10,000 to defend the town. The <HI>Hamburg|erberg</HI> may be &s;tiled a &s;uburb, but this is not envi|roned by any works, and the hou&s;es in it extend al|mo&s;t as far as Altena, a town belonging to Denmark, &s;o that it is merely a ditch that &s;eparates the one from the other.</P>
<P>To the city are &s;ome capital gates, but the&s;e are not &s;o much frequented as the two entrances by water from the Elbe, that is to &s;ay the upper and lower ba&s;ons. Through the latter pa&s;s all &s;hips going to or coming from &s;ea. Every morning at the opening of it, is &s;een a multitude of boats and &s;mall barks, who&s;e cargoes con&s;i&s;t of milk, fruits, and all kinds of provi|&s;ions, all ru&s;hing in at the &s;ame time. And in this manner the country people, who are for the mo&s;t part under the neighbouring juri&s;diction, together with a great number of others on the land &s;ide, in carriages, as likewi&s;e mo&s;t of the neighbouring pea&s;ants, daily
<PB N="209" REF="229">
bring in part of the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence nece&s;&s;ary to the city, and on the other hand return home with their own.</P>
<P>In the north of the town is al&s;o another entrance by water, which in this part runs into the city, &s;o as to form a kind of lake, but included within the fortifications. Here al&s;o in &s;ummer-time, the inhabi|tants amu&s;e them&s;elves in barges, of which &s;ome have cabins and are called arks. Near this port too, up the river Al&s;ter, is a walk con&s;i&s;ting of a double row of trees of con&s;iderable length, which in &s;ummer evenings is crowded with people, and called the <HI>Jun|fern Sti&ecirc;g,</HI> or the Young Ladies Walk.</P>
<P>The churches of Hamburg with their lofty &s;teeples make a grand appearance. The mo&s;t remarkable of the&s;e is the great church de&s;troyed by lightning, in 1750, and not yet repaired. In St. Catherines church is a prodigious organ, with 6000 pipes, per|haps a lie u&s;ually told to &s;trangers. The tower be|longing to the cathedral leans as if falling, yet on ac|count of the beauty of the architecture, the danger attending it has been overlooked. There are nine capital churches in all of which is &s;omething wor|thy of notice, &s;uch as tombs, &s;plendid altars, pul|pits, organs, paintings, and the like. The tower of St. Peter has two &s;ets of chimes belonging to it, one of which plays by clockwork. The hou&s;es are chiefly built with a bad-coloured brick, and the city appears
<PB N="210" REF="230">
on the whole not more elegant than Bri&s;tol, though much larger.</P>
<P>The public edifices are wanting in nothing &s;o much as in outward &s;tateline&s;s. The other &s;tructures here are chiefly worth &s;eeing, for their utility and the prodigious quantity of &s;tores in them, &s;uch as the building-yard, the ar&s;enal and two armouries; and a &s;tranger who has never &s;een &s;uch a number of large &s;hips together at one time, cannot but &s;ee the <HI>Baum|beu&s;e</HI> on the Elbe with a&s;toni&s;hment. The lovers of old Rheni&s;h, who have not before &s;atiated them&s;elves at Stra&s;burg or at Bremen, will not fail to vi&s;it the carpenter's cellar here. There are a number of inns here, but of the&s;e few are large enough to entertain foreigners with all their attendants; every part of the city being &s;o clo&s;ely built upon, and the in&s;ides of the hou&s;es not &s;o judiciou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed, as in other places of a more modern date; &s;o that the want of accommo|dation ill corre&s;ponds with the plenty of provi&s;ions and wines. There is one hou&s;e on the Elbe which was formerly a guard-hou&s;e, with a very large room on the top, with windows all round, a room of enter|tainment, which commands a view of all Hamburgh and a large tract of country on both &s;ides, with a view of the &s;hipping down the Elbe. As to the con|&s;titution and form of government, it exhibits a per|fect model of a well ordered &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="231">The burghery of Hamburgh is divided into five pari&s;hes, agreeable to the five principal churches, and the magi&s;tracy is compo&s;ed of 36 per&s;ons, with a re|corder at the head. It is now much above two hun|dred years &s;ince Lutherani&s;m has been the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of this city, and no other except the Jewi&s;h is here tolerated. But Papi&s;ts and Calvini&s;ts have an opportunity of attending the wor&s;hip of the envoys of the emperor and other &s;overeigns. The Hamburg clergy amount to 53 per&s;ons; each of the five princi|pal churches has a head mini&s;ter and three or four deacons belonging to it: on Sundays there are four &s;ermons in mo&s;t of the churches, and on every week day one, at lea&s;t in three places.</P>
<P>Hamburgh is &s;o occupied by trade and manufac|tures, that &s;carce any diver&s;ions are to be met with, except billiards, coffee-hou&s;es and concerts. They are fond of mu&s;ic, and are expen&s;ive in their public e&s;tabli&s;hments in its favour. The principal mer|chants have private concerts at their hou&s;es, at which company who have ideas beyond a counting-hou&s;e is &s;ometimes met with, but there is an inelegance, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> through every thing, &s;ome few hou&s;es of the more wealthy inhabitants excepted.</P>
<P>There is one &s;pecies of luxury, in which however none of the Hamburghers vie with our Engli&s;h mer|chants, that is in the expen&s;ivene&s;s and elegance of
<PB N="212" REF="232">
their hou&s;es, and in their co&s;tly and ornamental fur|niture. Some of the merchants hou&s;es in London are furni&s;hed like palaces, but tho&s;e of the riche&s;t in Hamburg, have nothing in them that ever reaches mediocrity. The highe&s;t appearance of luxury in this city, or at lea&s;t of unnece&s;&s;ary expence, is in the entertainments given at taverns, at weddings, chri&s;t|enings, burials, name-days, &amp;c. In the&s;e many of the wealthy expend as much as would build hou&s;es, and furni&s;h them when built; and they entertain at the death, as well as the birth of their relations.</P>
<P>The Hamburghers, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> much affect the manners of the French, in language, dre&s;s, ceremony, and compliment. They had once an Italian opera, but it dropped, and they are now confined to one theatre, in which, in the winter-&s;ea&s;on are exhibited, French and German comedies.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, continues <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> this city is not a place where a &s;tranger &s;hould re&s;ort for plea&s;ure, for the people are envelopped in trade; their numerous mar|kets afford but indifferent provi&s;ions; their meat is not excellent, and their fi&s;h not of the be&s;t &s;ort, and they have no oy&s;ters. Good claret is not met with in ta|verns, but their old hock and Rheni&s;h is in great perfection. A gentleman cannot &s;pend le&s;s than a guinea and a half a day.</P>

<P>Formerly the principal occupation of the inhabi|tants (commerce excepted) con&s;i&s;ted in brewing and making cloth. At pre&s;ent, the chief manufactory is refining of &s;ugar. The cotton, &s;tocking, gold thread, ribband, and velvet manufactures here, with others, are much e&s;teemed abroad.</P>

<P><PB N="214" REF="234">The &s;tate of carving and the fine arts are in great e&s;teem at Hamburg, and nothing omitted in the en|couragement of them. Hamburg may be &s;aid to abound in libraries, every church almo&s;t having one. There are many public &s;chools here; in a word, few places equal this in its &s;everal in&s;titutions for the libe|ral and religious education of youth. Among the fine arts, mu&s;ic is particularly encouraged; painting al&s;o is not without its admirers and connoi&s;&s;eurs, and it were well for the public, if architecture and mechanics were a little more in vogue. There is a city militia, con|&s;i&s;ting of five regiments, belonging to the five pari&s;h|es. The regular forces con&s;i&s;t of 12 companies of infantry, and one troop of dragoons, and a company of artillery.

<P>The fir&s;t appearance of Hamburg, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> is very di&s;gu&s;ting and ugly, the &s;treets being narrow, clo&s;e, and black, and the people fierce, wild, and in general not very clean. As &s;oon, however, as a man has made his way into the principal hou&s;es, he begins to conceive a more favourable opinion of it.

Though in few parts of Germany, gardening is in as flouri&s;h|ing a &s;tate as it is here, yet they are not contented with the wonderful vegetables which their own country affords, but import many &s;pecies of them from Eng|land, Holland, and various parts of Germany. They collect from all points of the compa&s;s, what every country produces peculiar to it&s;elf and co&s;tly for the table. It is the cu&s;tom in great hou&s;es to give parti|cular wine with every di&s;h, according to the e&s;tab|li&s;hed cour&s;es of good hou&s;e-keeping, Burgundy, Champaigne, Malaga, Port, Madeira, have each their different di&s;h to which they belong. With young green beans, which is a di&s;h of &s;ome ducats, and new herrings, which co&s;ts a guilder, the Hamburghers &s;eldom drink any thing but Malaga. Burgundy is the &s;tanding <HI>vohiculum</HI> of green pea&s;e; oy&s;ters mu&s;t &s;wim in Champaigne, and the co&s;tly &s;alt meats admit of no other convoy than Port and Madeira. This is not on fe&s;tivals only, but the daily food of the rich, and their way of living is proportionable. Few a&s;&s;em|blies of Pari&s;ians are more brilliant than the parties who meet in villas here, and they &s;carcely play &s;o high. Tho&s;e who can afford to &s;pend no more than

20 or 30,000 livres, that is about 1,000 or 1,200l. &s;terling, a year&punc; rank among the middling cla&s;s, and though they are all obliged to &s;upport them&s;elves by their own indu&s;try, and there is &s;carce any nobi|lity with a &s;tated income to be met with, there are many families who &s;pend from two to 3,000l. a year in hou&s;e-keeping.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this love of good eating, the mind is not oppre&s;&s;ed or borne down by the body here, as it is in &s;outhern Germany. The Hamburghers of the higher cla&s;s are &s;till more jovial, more happy, more conver&s;ible, and more witty than the Saxons. We meet here with many literati of the fir&s;t cla&s;s. Natural hi&s;tory flouri&s;hes much, and it was a Ham|burgher that gave <HI>Linnaeus</HI> the fundamental ideas of his <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae.</HI> As mo&s;t young people are &s;ent abroad to form trading connections in the &s;everal ports of London, Peter&s;burg, Calais, Bourdeaux, &amp;c. in all which the Hamburghers have hou&s;es, a &s;tranger is &s;ure to meet with &s;ome per&s;ons who are ac|quainted with his native country.</P>
<P>The women of this place are hand&s;ome, genteel, and freer in their manners than they are generally in Prote&s;tant countries. One of the great plea&s;ures of this city ari&s;es from the Al&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er&s;lu&s;s. It comes from the north, pa&s;&s;es through the middle of the city, and forms a lake in it nearly 800 paces in circumference.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="237">In a &s;ummer evening this lake is almo&s;t covered with gondolas, which have not &s;uch a melancholy a&s;pect as the Venetian ones; they are filled with a fa|mily, or other parties, and have often boats in atten|dance upon them, with mu&s;ic. The whole has an a&s;toni&s;hing good effect; which is &s;till greater from there being a much frequented public walk by the lake; the liveline&s;s of which corre&s;ponds, very plea|&s;ingly, with that of the people on the water.</P>
<P>Near the city are &s;ome villages on the Elbe, called the Four Lands, which are in &s;ummer al&s;o a rendez|vous of plea&s;ure. The farmers who live in the&s;e villages are in very good circum&s;tances, and take a prodigious &s;um of money from the town, for their excellent vegetables, and particularly for their green peas. Every day, during the &s;ummer, we meet here with parties from the city, who are as con&s;picuous for their genteel appearance, as for their exce&s;&s;es in eating and drinking. The farmers daughters are very pretty, and their dre&s;s the hand&s;ome&s;t to be met with among this cla&s;s of people. They allure the young men of the city to their cottages, and many quarter them&s;elves here under the pretence of a milk diet; but, in fact, to be near their &s;weethearts.</P>
<P>The&s;e four villages &s;upply the town with vege|tables, butter, milk, hay, and many other things of

<P>The city of Altona, which joins Hamburgh, af|fords al&s;o the Hamburghers many opportunities of amu&s;ement. The King of Denmark, who from the jealou&s;y of Hamburge, endeavours by every means in his power to make this place flouri&s;hing, appears to have it in his head, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> to hurt the inns and brothels of the city, as well as the trade. Through his care, Altona has, in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, from a &s;mall village, become a town of 35,000 inhabitants; among whom, however, to &s;peak freely, there are far too many ra&s;cals.</P>
<P>Altona is &s;eated on a high &s;hore of the Elbe, con|tains about 3000 hou&s;es, better in appearance than tho&s;e of Hamburgh, with two Lutheran and two Cal|vini&s;t churches; a fifth for the French Calvini&s;ts, a &s;ixth for Roman catholics, two Menonite churches, exclu&s;ive of other &s;ects who are here tolerated. The Jews al&s;o are very numerous here and have a &s;yna|gogue; they pay 2000 ducats a year for protection. Here is al&s;o a royal <HI>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mna&s;ium,</HI> and three docks for &s;hip-building. The town was profe&s;&s;edly built to &s;teal the trade from Hamburgh, and is made a free port.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="239">The &s;treets are &s;trait and regularly built, wide and well paved. There is a new town-hou&s;e erected, and &s;everal other public buildings &s;hew, that the place is in a flouri&s;hing and improving way. The merchants hou&s;es, like tho&s;e at Hamburgh, are on the water|&s;ide, &s;o that &s;hips load and unload at their doors. The King of Denmark has made it the &s;taple of the Dani&s;h Ea&s;t-India Company; and, owing to this, it &s;ends large quantities of India goods into mo&s;t parts of Germany, and herein rivals the Hamburghers, who are forced to buy their's of the Dutch; but the misfortune is, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> that the great freedom of reception here brings all &s;orts of wretches; even ma|lefactors, from Hamburgh, here find an a&s;ylum; nor does a merchant or trade&s;man, of any kind, fail and defraud their creditors; but he appears here again on the &s;tage, and carries on a fre&s;h trade, as if nothing had happened. No &s;tews, or &s;treet-walkers are al|lowed at Hamburgh; but both abound at Altona in the greate&s;t plenty; and the place &s;warms with Jews.</P>
<P>The country round about Hamburg, though a flat, is extremely plea&s;ant; the various and flouri&s;hing agriculture gives it a very gay appearance, and the water contributes much to its beauty. The river con|duces extremely to the advantage of the city, which by taking the la&s;t toll, has almo&s;t an unlimited com|mand over it. Notwith&s;tanding the quantity of water
<PB N="220" REF="240">
and low &s;ituation, the air is very good, owing to the &s;trong winds which blow upon it from all quarters.</P>
<P>A word or two of its trade, and we have done.</P>
<P>Hamburgh is, without compari&s;on, the mo&s;t flou|ri&s;hing commercial city in all Germany. Except Lon|don and Am&s;terdam, there is hardly a port in which &s;o many &s;hips are con&s;tantly &s;een. The pre&s;ent bu|&s;ine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in great part of commi&s;&s;ion and carry|ing; but the &s;tated trade of the people is al&s;o very con&s;iderable. Hamburgh has &s;upplied Spain with mo&s;t of its linens, and with large quantities of iron, copper, and other articles of the north. The Dani&s;h government omits nothing that can hurt them. The Dani&s;h mini&s;try have a favourite pro&s;pect of uniting the Baltic to the German ocean, by a canal joined to the Eyder. This &s;eems to be a death-&s;troke to the commerce of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and Hamburgh; but the intel|ligent part of the country are as ea&s;y about this as they would be, if his Dani&s;h maje&s;ty was to order a canal to be dug in Greenland.</P>
<P>Hamburgh is truly &s;ingular as a commercial city; for you meet in it with per&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> who have been bank|rupts three or four times, and yet have been rich at la&s;t. The misfortune is&punc; that as &s;oon as a merchant makes 100,000 guilders, that is about 12,000l. &s;ter|ling, he mu&s;t have his coach and country-hou&s;e.
<PB N="221" REF="241">
His expences keep pace with his income, &s;o that the lea&s;t blow brings him back to poverty; but which, however, the &s;lighte&s;t exertions will extricate him from. He &s;ets out in life again as a broker; and &s;carce &s;hall his old e&s;tate and country-hou&s;e and car|riages be &s;old, but he purcha&s;es another e&s;tate, an|other country-hou&s;e, is able to drive through the town with two prancing Hol&s;teins; has his garden, his coach, his gambling box&mdash;till, <HI>heigh pre&s;to!</HI>&mdash;he is a broker again. This inexplicable facility of making u&s;e of one's money, renders the Hamburgher here too bold; &s;o that he does more bu&s;ine&s;s with 50,000 florins, than a Dutchman will do with four times the &s;um. However, the &s;ecurity he is under of not being obliged to beg in his old age, renders him quite carele&s;s. There are indeed no where &s;uch good retreats for bankrupts as in this place. If broken merchants do not chu&s;e to try their luck again; by turning brokers, they have employments given them, on which they can live comfortably. The Ham|burgher, however, works him&s;elf up again with the &s;ame ea&s;e with which he falls. Rich inheritances here are very &s;carce, in compari&s;on to the &s;um of money there is in the place; and as this is divided among too many, the ebbs and flows are too fre|quent. The great capital of every inhabitant is in|du&s;try and under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="242">The government of Hamburgh is wonderful, a ju&s;t mean between ari&s;tocracy and democracy. The le|gi&s;lative power is in the hands of the burge&s;&s;es, of which there are hou&s;es or colleges. The fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of the aldermen, three of whom are cho&s;en by the in|habitants of the re&s;t of the five pari&s;hes. Each pari&s;h al&s;o &s;ends nine to the &s;econd college, and twenty-four to the third. All laws mu&s;t pa&s;s the&s;e three hou&s;es; the executive power is lodged in the hands of 36 per&s;ons, who are graduated <HI>literati,</HI> and have given proofs of their learning. The income of the &s;tate is very large, partly from &s;tanding &s;ources, and partly from occa&s;ional taxes. Hamburgh is, in truth, the model of a well-regulated commonwealth; and the be&s;t &s;ign of its wi&s;e admini&s;tration is, that it is almo&s;t the only Imperial city that carries none of its &s;uits, between its own members, to the tribunal of the empire.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h company, which on the decay of Ant|werp, removed to this place, is a regular, polite, and re&s;pectable &s;ociety of merchants. Their goods from England are imported here free of duty, except a tri|fle by way of acknowledgment. Their own juri&s;dic|tion and religion is freely granted them. They have a chapel and an ordinary room, where all the com|pany, who are unmarried, dine and &s;up at one table. The number of merchants and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, amounts to 30 or 40 per&s;ons, and their congregation, with their

<PB N="223" REF="244">
wives, children, and &s;ervants, generally amount to 150 or 200 per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The burgoma&s;ters of this place, &s;ays <HI>Chi&s;ul,</HI> never appear in public, but in a peculiar dre&s;s, which con|&s;i&s;ts of a high crowned hat, made of cloth, plaited thick and &s;trong in numerous folds, with a large ruff, and a black velvet coat ending at the knees, and plaited from the middle. There are likewi&s;e &s;everal other ancient habits u&s;ed by all public per&s;ons, even to midwives, dre&s;&s;ers of the dead, and tho&s;e who bear the corps at funerals. The habit of their divines is a round black cap, a ruff, and a gown without &s;leeves. All the&s;e may commonly be &s;een at once in the &s;olemnity of a funeral, which they here affect to make very pompous, for all per&s;ons, even tho&s;e of little children. The burgo-ma&s;ters, &s;enators, di|vines, lawyers, phy&s;icians, and as many of all &s;orts as they can procure, attend the corps from the hou&s;e to the church, for which they are paid a certain fee; the chief about a florin, and inferiors proportionally. It is ob&s;ervable that the bearers of the corps have a pe|culiar &s;tep, all moving their legs at the &s;ame time cro&s;swi&s;e, from one &s;ide to the other.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Chi&s;ul</HI> tells us, that he was informed of a de|te&s;table practice frequent among many melancholy and di&s;ordered per&s;ons of this place, who, weary of life, and apprehen&s;ive of the &s;in of &s;elf murder, rather
<PB N="224" REF="245">
cho&s;e to murder &s;ome innocent child, and by this means be brought to capital puni&s;hment. This tra|gedy happening every year, and the frequency of the practice, is attributed to the too great facility of their confe&s;&s;ors in affording peace and fair promi&s;es to all &s;orts of dying penitents.</P>
<P>In this duchy, the lord&s;hip of Pinnenburg and town of Altona included, there are 14 towns and 18 bo|roughs. The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion here is Luther|ani&s;m.</P>
<P>Lubeck is an Imperial city, the capital of Wager|land, and is the chief of the Han&s;e-Towns. It is plea|&s;antly &s;ituated in the duchy of Hol&s;tein Gottorp, on the river Trave, ten miles from the Baltic &s;ea, and 40 miles north of Hamburgh. The uniformity and beauty of its buildings, as well as its groves and gar|dens, proclaim it to be a delightful &s;pot. Several of the &s;treets are planted with rows of trees, and from a public re&s;ervoir water is laid in to every hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The city is oddly built on two &s;ides of a hill, and on that account is romantic to look at. At the bot|tom of each declivity is a river. The &s;treets are bet|ter laid out than tho&s;e at Hamburgh, broad and regu|lar, but in general &s;teep; the hou&s;es are pretty well built with free-&s;tone, but old fa&s;hioned; they have large apartments, and &s;pacious cellars, but the doors of the hou&s;es are &s;o wide and high, that a cart loaded
<PB N="225" REF="246">
with hay may pa&s;s through them. The city is kept very clean, by means of its uneven &s;ituation, every &s;hower of rain wa&s;hing down all the dirt and leaving it in better order than any &s;cavengers could. Here are &s;ome public buildings, which they make a parade of &s;hewing to &s;trangers, but they have nothing re|markable. It has five churches, a town-hou&s;e, an ar&s;enal, and an ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>St. Mary's church is the large&s;t of the five. It is a lofty building, &s;tanding in the centre of the city, has a double &s;teeple, 217 yards high, built in 1304. The in&s;ide is properly decorated with gilt pillars, monu|ments, &amp;c. but few worth notice. The mo&s;t remark|able thing at Lubeck is the clock in this church. It exhibits the ecliptic, zodiac, equator, and tropics, and the planets in their &s;everal cour&s;es; which are &s;o minutely done, that the &s;tation of any of them is to be found at every time of the day, it &s;hews the regu|lar variations of the cele&s;tial bodies, &s;un ri&s;ing and &s;et|ting, the eclip&s;es of the moon, and other remarkable days, all which it will continue to &s;hew till the year 1875. Be&s;ides all this, it has &s;everal automata, a|mong others, a figure of Chri&s;t, with a door on its right hand, which opening at 12 at noon, out come in order of proce&s;&s;ion, the emperor and the &s;even el|de&s;t electors, and turning to the image, make a pro|found reverence; this the figure returns, by a wave of his hand; after which the whole group retires in the

&s;ame order through a door on the left, and both doors &s;hut directly. In the lower, is another piece of ma|chinery, and a much more agreeable one, the chimes. The&s;e play the hours with a mo&s;t plea&s;ing melody and minute exactne&s;s. Under them is the bell, on which is &s;truck the hour by a figure of Time, whil&s;t a le&s;&s;er figure, repre&s;enting Mortality, and &s;tanding at the other &s;ide of the bell, turns a&s;ide its head at every &s;troke. This work, for its pre&s;ervation, is &s;ur|rounded with a wire frame, and by an in&s;cription we are told it was erected in 1405.</P>
<P>The Cathedral at Lubeck is a building of great an|tiquity, being erected in the year 1170, by Duke <HI>Henry,</HI> ance&s;tor of the pre&s;ent elector of Hanover. Lubeck has a trade that is not de&s;picable, her &s;ituation and port are extremely commodious. From the Baltic, &s;he imports the products of Denmark, Norway, Swe|den, Ru&s;&s;ia, and Poland, and by her inland naviga|tion, di&s;tributes them through many parts of Ger|many.</P>
<P>In many particulars there is a &s;imilarity, between the way of living, diver&s;ions and manners of the peo|ple of Lubeck and tho&s;e of Hamburg, and the inns here are very good, and entertainment full as cheap again as at Hamburg.</P>

<HEAD>Of the TERRITORIES of the ELECTORAL HOUSE of BRUNSWICK-LUNEBURGH.</HEAD>
<P>The territories of this electorate belong chiefly to the circle of Lower Saxony, with a &s;mall part of them in the Lower Rhine, and the &s;malle&s;t part of all in Upper Saxony. Among&s;t the fir&s;t are the duchies of Bremen and Lauenburg, with the principalities of Luneburg, Calenburg and Grubenhagen, and their incorporated counties and lord&s;hips: among the &s;econd is the principality of Verden, &amp;c. and the third cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of the county of Hohn&s;tein. All the&s;e &s;everal domains form a &s;quare of about 700 geographical miles, being thus nearly of equal ex|tent with the kingdom of Pru&s;&s;ia, or the whole circle of Suabia, or even with the electorate of Saxony, or all the lands under the elector of Bavaria; the num|ber of places in them, cities, plains, villages, and &s;ingle farms included, exceeds 4000; among which are 58 cities, and about 60 market-towns. In 1756, by a cal|culation, the inhabitants amounted to near 750,000.</P>
<P>The&s;e countries, in general, produce all the nece&s;&s;a|ries of life, and abound with fo&s;&s;ils and minerals. The manufactures are improving con&s;iderably, &s;uch as &s;tarch, powder, linen, dama&s;k linen, ribbands, laces, cere-cloths, printed and painted, carpets, linen-printing, hemp and cotton worked up in all forms, tobacco and &s;nuffs, madder and woad made into co|lours, leather, and manufactured wool, and woollen

<P>The chief towns have grammar-&s;chools, and there is an excellent univer&s;ity at Gottingen. The e&s;tab|li&s;hed religion throughout is Lutherani&s;m; the paro|chial churches are about 750, divided into 43 &s;uper|intendancies, under the in&s;pection of four general ones.

Tra|dition &s;ays, &s;he was an Engli&s;h counte&s;s, who, dying at Bremen, ordered her body to be placed in this vault un-interred, in the apprehen&s;ion that her relations would order it over to her native country; they &s;ay, it has lain here 250 years. Though the mu&s;cular &s;kin is totally dried in every part, yet &s;o little are the
<PB N="232" REF="253">
features of the face &s;unk or changed, that nothing is more certain than that &s;he was young and even beau|tiful. It is a &s;mall countenance, and round in its contour; the cartilages of the no&s;e and no&s;trils have undergone no alteration; her teeth are all firm in the &s;ockets, but the lips are drawn away from over them; the cheeks are &s;hrunk in, but yet le&s;s than in embalmed bodies. The hair of her head is more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">8 inches long, very thick, and &s;o fa&s;t, that I heaved the corp&s;e out of the coffin by it; the colour is a light brown, and as fre&s;h and glo&s;&s;y as that of a living per&s;on. That this lady was of high rank, &s;eems evident from the finene&s;s of the linen, which covers her body. The landlord of the inn who ac|companied Mr. <HI>Wraxall,</HI> told him he had remem|bered it for forty years pa&s;t, and during which time there was not the lea&s;t perceptible alteration in it. In another coffer is the body of a workman, who is &s;aid to have tumbled off the church, and was killed by the fall. His features evince this mo&s;t forcibly. Extreme agony is marked in them, his mouth is wide open, and his eye-lids the &s;ame; the eyes are dried up. His brea&s;t is unnaturally di&s;tended, and his whole frame betrays a violent death. A lit|tle child who died of the &s;mall-pox is &s;till more remarkable. The marks of the pu&s;tules which have broken the &s;kin, on her hands and head, are very di&s;cernible, and one would &s;uppo&s;e that a body which died of &s;uch a di&s;temper, mu&s;t contain

The cau&s;e of this phenome|non is doubtle&s;s the dryne&s;s of the place. It is in vain to &s;eek for any other. The magi&s;trates do not permit that any fre&s;h bodies be brought here, and there is no other &s;ubterraneous chamber that has the &s;ame property. It would have made an excellent miracle in proper hands, two or three centuries ago; but mankind are now grown too wi&s;e.</P>
<P>This city is celebrated for its old hock; the wine is all brought here from the banks of the Rhine, by land-carriage, and depo&s;ited in the public cellars, which are wonderfully capacious, running beneath the town-hou&s;e and exchange, but are not to be com|pared with the marquis of Pombals at Peyras in Portu|gal, or tho&s;e of Con&s;tantia at the Cape of Good Hope. There is one particular room in the&s;e cellars, where they keep wine (as they &s;ay) of 170 years old, and for which they a&s;k &s;even dollars (or 25s.) a bottle; but it is not fit to drink.</P>

It is a free city under the pro|tection of the Emperor, and, on the money &s;truck here, &s;tiles it&s;elf a republic. The King of England, as Elector of Hanover, has however &s;ome important rights within the place, and not only the cathedral belongs to him, but a con&s;iderable number of build|ings, public, and private. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es likewi&s;e a &s;pecies of &s;upreme, judicatorial power, as though the magi&s;trates take cognizance of all crimes within the territory of Bremen, his delegate mu&s;t pronounce &s;en|tence. The fortifications, though kept in good or|der, are of no con&s;equence or &s;trength; the &s;tronge&s;t army in the field is always ma&s;ter, and during the la&s;t war in the&s;e parts, French or Engli&s;h were alternately received into the place, as they appeared before it. The &s;tile of building here is horrid, all the upper &s;to|ries being granaries, and totally uninhabitable; it has a mo&s;t grote&s;que appearance to the eye, though many of the hou&s;es now are in &s;ome degree modernized.

<P>The principality of Luneburg Zell is watered by the Elbe and two other rivers; about 4000 acres of it are barren, but the re&s;t is prolific. It contains three large cities, Luneburg, Uelzen, and Zell, eleven towns, and 13 large villages. The general diets here are convened by the Sovereign, and held twice a year at the council-hou&s;e at Zell: the princes propo&s;als are laid before the &s;tates by a mini&s;ter, and their &s;enti|ments delivered verbally by their &s;yndic.</P>
<P>Luneburg and the capital of the principality, lies on a navigable river, which runs through part of the town, is environed with moats and walls, fortified with towers, and is two miles in circuit, con&s;i&s;ting of about 1,300 hou&s;es, with between eight and 9,000 inhabitants, and three pari&s;h churches, with a palace for the prince.

<P>Zell is a fortified and well built town, &s;ituated on a navigable river, and contains about 1400 hou&s;es. It is a &s;mall town, without trade or manufactures; the hou&s;es are old and of a mean appearance, chiefly built with wood, yet the high courts of appeal in all the ter|ritories of the Elector are here held, and the inhabi|tants derive their principal means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from this circum&s;tance. Here are four Lutheran churches, one French, one Dutch, and one Spani&s;h. A corps of 700 men are continually quartered here. It has long been di&s;tingui&s;hed for a &s;tud of fine hor&s;es kept on purpo&s;e for &s;tate. They are 150 in number, and the pedigree of each hor&s;e is marked on the po&s;t of his &s;tall.

The whole Hartz yields annually about 1,172,733 rix-dollars, of which, gold, to the value of 2880, is coined into ducats, and 802,860 of &s;ilver.

It lies on the left &s;hore of the river Leine, which, after running in two channels between the old and new town, and thus forming an i&s;land, unites into one &s;tream again, and becomes navigable. The town it&s;elf is fortified and well kept, and contains about 1200 hou&s;es, among which are many large and hand&s;ome buildings. It is a neat, thriving, and agreeable city, and has more the face of an Engli&s;h town, than any town in Germany; and the Engli&s;h manners and cu&s;toms gain ground in it every day. The general influence of freedom has extended to this place; tyranny is not felt, and ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction appear in the countenance of the citizens.</P>

The opera-hou&s;e is a hand&s;ome building, and holds a great number of people; but it is &s;carce ever full; nor have operas been performed in it for &s;ome time. The Elector's palace is an old ca&s;tle that &s;tands near the town; it is a large irregular building, without any beauties of architecture, but has &s;everal courts, and contains a va&s;t deal of room. In one of the apartments are a great number of portraits of the ducal family, &s;ome of which are admirably ex|ecuted, and four of them have been emperors. The library is a large apartment, well filled with many &s;carce books and valuable collections of manu&s;cripts. But what is much finer than the palace, are the &s;tables; far beyond any royal &s;tables in England, and the&s;e are kept well filled with hor&s;es. In the palace is a complete court kept up, with all the great offices of &s;tate and per&s;on, with attendants, guards, &amp;c. which makes the place lively and agreeable, and occa&s;ions amu&s;ements. Here is a theatre for French come|dians, in which a good company, from Paris, exhi|bits. Balls and concerts are not uncommon, and a&s;|&s;emblies are very numerous, in which is much deep play. A public table is kept by the great chamber|lain at the King's expence; and all foreigners of di|&s;tinction are invited to it, as is the cu&s;tom of the prin|cipal courts in Germany.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="264">Hanover, &s;ays Baron <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> con&s;ider it in what light you will, is a very fine city; the number of its inhabitants is about 20,000. There are very good &s;ocieties here, to which the officers contribute not a little. The people are &s;ober and regular, and per|form every e&s;&s;ential part of duty well, though the di&s;cipline is not &s;o rigid as in &s;ome other parts of Germany. The infantry are not &s;o tall, as &s;ome other German troops, no per&s;on being here forced into the &s;ervice; whereas, in other parts of Germany, the prince picks out the &s;toute&s;t and talle&s;t of the pea|&s;ants, and obliges them to inli&s;t. It is allowed, in action, that no troops behave better than the Hano|verians, and they &s;eldom de&s;ert. The forces are al|ways rated at 24,000 men.</P>

conceive what could put his excellency into a com|motion &s;o little &s;uitable to his years and habit of body. Whil&s;t all the &s;pectators were on tiptoe to ob&s;erve the i&s;&s;ue of this phenomenon, he arrived at the ranks, and in great wrath, which probably had been aug|mented by the heat acquired in his cour&s;e, pulled off one of the &s;oldier's hats, which it &s;eems had not been properly cocked, and adju&s;ted it to his mind. Having regulated the military di&s;cipline, in this im|portant particular, he returned to his prince's right hand, with a &s;trut expre&s;&s;ive of the highe&s;t &s;elf-approbation.</P>
<P>At the palace there is a hou&s;hold e&s;tabli&s;hed, with officers and &s;ervants, and a guard regularly mounted, as at the time when the electors re&s;ided here con|&s;tantly. The liveries of the pages and &s;ervants are the &s;ame with tho&s;e worn by the king's dome&s;tic &s;ervants at St. James's. The memory of George II. is greatly venerated here. Many of the cotemporaries of a &s;o|ciety he formed were &s;till living when <HI>Moore</HI> was there; and from their accounts he learned that he was naturally of a very &s;ociable temper; and entirely laid a&s;ide, when at Hanover, the &s;tile and re&s;erve which he retained in England, living in that familiar and confidential manner which princes, as well as pea|&s;ants, will a&s;&s;ume in the company of tho&s;e they love, and tho&s;e who love them.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="266"><HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> &s;ays, the nobility in this place are as refined in their manners as tho&s;e of any other German city. He was at O&s;naburg when the duke of York, the pre&s;ent bi&s;hop of O&s;naburg, re&s;ided there; and de|clares that, by his deportment, he made a particular circle of the inhabitants very happy; and it was the wi&s;h of the people that he would be made governor of this electorate, and re&s;ide con&s;tantly among them.</P>
<P>Herenhau&s;en lies near this city. It is a plea&s;ant walk through a magnificent avenue of trees, as broad, and about double the length of the Mall in St. James's park. It is a &s;mall hunting-palace, with very magni|ficent gardens, in which the water-works are particu|larly admired; but the&s;e gardens are in the old Dutch &s;tyle, the ground perfectly level, and compo&s;ed of &s;trait lines and compa&s;s-work, water, hedges, lawns, walks; every thing regularly fatiguing. The <HI>jet d'eau</HI> is, in its kind, fine; but the man who has been in England, and can admire <HI>jets d'eau,</HI> mu&s;t have a mi|&s;erable ta&s;te indeed. The hou&s;e it&s;elf has nothing ex|traordinary in its appearance; but the gardens are as magnificent as the Dutch &s;tyle will permit them. The orangery is reckoned equal to any in Europe. Here is a kind of rural theatre, where plays may be acted during the fine weather: a &s;pacious amphi|theatre is cut out in green &s;eats for the &s;pectators; a &s;tage in the &s;ame ta&s;te, with rows of trees for &s;ide &s;cenes, and a great number of arbours and &s;ummer-rooms,
<PB N="245" REF="267">
&s;urrounded by lofty hedges for the actors to retire and dre&s;s in.</P>
<P>When the theatre is illuminated, which is always done when ma&s;querades are given, it mu&s;t have a very fine effect. The groves, arbours and labyrinths, &s;eem admirably calculated for all the purpo&s;es of this amu&s;ement. In the&s;e gardens are &s;everal large re&s;er|voirs and fountains; and, on one &s;ide a canal of a quarter of a mile long.</P>
<P>Though &s;ome parts of the electorate of Hanover, continues <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> are very fertile, yet on the whole it is the mo&s;t mi&s;erable part of all Germany. It is about 700 German miles or 2,800 Engli&s;h in circumference, but &s;carcely contains 700,000 inhabitants, a &s;lender population con&s;idering the extent; but this is owing to the &s;oil. The country abounds in &s;and-heaths, which are almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to cultivate. The whole reve|nues of Hanover amount only to 480,000 guilders, each guilder 2s. 4d. Engli&s;h, or 56,000l. of which the mines in the Hartz contribute a fourth part. The country belonging to the elector of Saxony, which is very little larger, transfers nearly as much again.</P>
<P>The government of this country is gentle. The great offices of &s;tate are held by active and enlight|ened patriots. No money is here extorted from the

<P>Gottingen is, in fact, the chief city of the princi|pality of Calenberg; it is &s;ituated in a &s;pacious, fertile and plea&s;ant vale, along the water called the New Leine, which is a canal drawn from the river of that name, the town being about 100 rods from it. This canal &s;eparates the old from the new town; and, at about the di&s;tance of a mile, joins the Leine again. The ramparts amid the town, which are about 690 rods in circumference, command a delightful pro&s;pect of gardens of aRakinds, with meadows, fields and eminen|ces; and would form a mo&s;t delightful walk, were the u&s;ele&s;s brea&s;t-works on it removed, and the wall le|velled and planted with lime-trees. The town it&s;elf con|&s;i&s;ts of upwards of 1000 hou&s;es, and about 80,000 peo|ple; and, &s;ince the erection of the univer&s;ity, has been &s;o embelli&s;hed with new buildings, and the old &s;o re|paired, that it is at pre&s;ent one of the be&s;t built towns in all Lower Saxony; and for the fine free-&s;tone pavements on both &s;ides of its &s;treets, may be &s;aid to have few equals.

<HEAD>The PRINCIPALITY of WOLFENBUTTLE.</HEAD>
<P>This is a part of the duchy of Brun&s;wick, and is included in the circle of Lower Saxony. The dioce&s;e of Hilde&s;heim and the principality of Halber&s;tadt di|vide
<PB N="248" REF="270">
it into two parts. In this principality are ten bo|roughs, eight market towns, 386 villages, and 17 &s;ees and convents. The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion is Luthera|ni&s;m. But at Brun&s;wick, the Calvini&s;ts and papi&s;ts are both permitted the u&s;e of a church. Not to men|tion the &s;pinning of thread and the weaving of linen, here are &s;undry manufactures in wool and &s;ilk, with hou&s;es for bleaching of wax, which likewi&s;e is pre|pared in various ways; and Turkey, and other &s;orts of leather are dre&s;&s;ed here. Its porcelain, lead, iron and &s;teel founderies too, are in great repute; and the gla&s;s-hou&s;es are much admired for the beauty of their productions. Walnut-tree, turnery and cabinet-makers ware, &amp;c. with the celebrated Brun&s;wick mum and duck&s;tein, which is beer brewed at Konig&s;lutter, are not without their celebrity.</P>
<P>Brun&s;wick is the capital of the country, and re&s;idence of the Duke. It is a fortified city, and lies on the Ocker, which enters the town by two branches, but within it divides it&s;elf into a great number, uniting again in one &s;tream as it leaves the town. The ram|parts are planted with mulberry-trees. The town is large, but its buildings are in the old ta&s;te; however, lately, it has been beautified with new buildings, and its &s;treets better paved. In the library of the palace is a valuable collection of &s;carce and curious bibles, or parts of bibles, in various languages, to the num|ber of 1000 volumes, collected by <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> widow
<PB N="249" REF="271">
to duke <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> in 1731. In this city is an opera hou&s;e and a theatre, &s;ome good public foundations, and &s;everal manufactories. The fir&s;t &s;pinning-wheels were invented here, in 1530, by <HI>Jurgen</HI> a &s;tatuary. Brun&s;wick has two yearly fairs, and very con&s;iderable ones.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants of this city are &s;aid to exceed 30,000. The con&s;titution of the place affords a military government; for a &s;ummary law in&s;tantly decides all litigated points between individuals.</P>
<P>Wolfenbuttle is the chief re&s;idence of the Duke of Brun&s;wick-Wolfenbuttle, and is al&s;o &s;ituated on the river Ocker, &s;even miles &s;outh of Brun&s;wick, and 30 we&s;t of Halber&s;tadt.</P>
<P>It is &s;urrounded by bogs and mora&s;&s;es, and &s;trong by nature and art. This place Dr. <HI>Brooke</HI> in his Mo|dern Survey, &s;ays, is the &s;tronge&s;t town in Germany. It is well fortified, and elegant in appearance.</P>
<P>The public library is very con&s;iderable, and reckon|ed one of the mo&s;t complete in Germany, containing upwards of 200,000 volumes; among&s;t which are many curious M&s;s. &s;ome of which were written by the two leaders of the reformation, <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="272">This edifice, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Moore,</HI> is entirely of wood, neverthele&s;s there are &s;ome very magnificent apart|ments in it; and a great gallery of pictures, &s;ome of which are allowed by connoi&s;&s;eurs to be excellent. The picture gallery is 200 feet long, 50 broad, and 40 high; and altogether is &s;urprizingly elegant in ap|pearance.</P>
<P>In the palace there is a cabinet of porcelain, con|taining between 7 and 8000 pieces: and in another &s;maller cabinet is &s;hewn a collection of coar&s;e plates, valuable only on account of their having been painted after the de&s;igns of <HI>Raph&auml;el.</HI></P>
<P>The circumjacent country is very picture&s;que and plea&s;ing. A per&s;on is agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed on behold|ing the number of &s;eats and noble man&s;ions; a &s;ight very rare in Germany, where, if one avoids the towns and courts, you may travel over a great extent of country without perceiving hou&s;es for any order of men, between the prince and the pea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The family of Brun&s;wick-Wolfenbuttle was, till very lately, divided into three branches, viz. Brun&s;wick-Proper, Brun&s;wick-Wolfenbuttle, and Brun&s;wick-Beve|ren. The two fir&s;t are extinct, and now the Duke of Bremen is &s;tiled Duke of Brun&s;wick-Wolfenbuttle; as the Elector of Hanover is &s;tiled Duke of Brun&s;wick-Luneburg.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="273">The princes of both hou&s;es are de&s;cended from Erne&s;t Duke of Luneburg and Zell; the branch of Wolfenbuttle from <HI>Henry</HI> his elde&s;t &s;on, and that of Hanover from <HI>William</HI> his younge&s;t &s;on. Indeed this family derives not greater lu&s;tre from its an|tiquity, then from having given empre&s;&s;es to Ger|many, and from having a younger branch on the throne of Britain.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the principality or du|chy is that of Lutherani&s;m. Calvini&s;ts and Papi&s;ts are likewi&s;e tolerated.</P>
<P>In this duchy and capital are &s;everal large manu|factories for thread and linen cloth, and other fabrics; be&s;ides all &s;orts of dre&s;&s;ed leather, turnery, foundery wares, lead, gla&s;s, with various large tobacco manu|factories.</P>
<P>The Duke's palace at Salzdalum, or Saltzdahlen, is worthy the curio&s;ity of a traveller; it is &s;ituated at the di&s;tance of half a league from Wolfenbuttle, and about a long German mile from Brun&s;wick, in a very mean village, and the road to it but indifferent. The greate&s;t part of this palace is of timber; the rooms are mo&s;tly lined with painted cloths, which have a ta&s;te of grandeur at a &s;mall expence. Here the garden is in fine ta&s;te, but the &s;tatues are very mean. The gallery of pictures is a noble apartment,
<PB N="252" REF="274">
and its contents not le&s;s worthy of attention. The end of it divides into &s;everal apartments. The left wing is furni&s;hed in a grote&s;que ta&s;te, with por|celaine ranged in an agreeable manner. Another is full of painted enamelled ware, great part of which is &s;aid to be done by <HI>Rhaphael de Urbino,</HI> when he was enamoured with the Potter's daughter. This collec|tion is &s;aid to be of above 200 years &s;tanding.</P>
<P>Of pictures there are many curious originals, &s;ome remarkable for the &s;ubject, and others for the exe|cution.</P>
<P>There are various &s;eminaries for learning and edu|cating of youth; but the univer&s;ity of Helm&s;tadt, which is &s;ituated about four miles ea&s;t of Wolfen|buttle, may be reckoned a very excellent fini&s;hing &s;chool.</P>
<P>The revenues of this country are &s;aid not to exceed a million and a half of dollars, or 262,000l. and though the court is &s;o numerous, the oeconomy of it is &s;uch, that the duke has his theatrical and mu&s;ical entertainments, and foreigners are received with great civility. Per&s;ons of great di&s;tinction being con&s;idered in &s;ome mea&s;ure upon an equality, &s;eldom leave this court without being extremely well &s;atisfied with the reception they meet with. Engli&s;h noblemen in par|ticular are well received when they occa&s;ionally pa&s;s
<PB N="253" REF="275">
that way. The Duke &s;eems to con&s;ult his ea&s;e and happine&s;s, rather than the parade of life. He gene|rally appears in his coach with three others of his fa|mily. His livery is yellow, laced with a galoon of blue &s;ilk and &s;ilver, and has u&s;ually four footmen be|hind his carriage: two pages in blue cloth laced with &s;ilver on each &s;ide of it, and a &s;ervant in livery riding before him to prepare the way.</P>
<P>The character of the &s;overeign at every court has great influence in forming the ta&s;te and manners of the courtiers. This mu&s;t operate with increa&s;ed force in the little courts of Germany, where the parties are brought nearer to each other, and &s;pend mo&s;t of their time together. The plea&s;ure which the duche&s;s of Brun&s;wick took in &s;tudy, I mean, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> the wife of the late prince Ferdinand, who was the fa|vourite &s;i&s;ter of the late king of Pru&s;&s;ia, made read|ing very fa&s;hionable among the ladies of that court; of this her royal highne&s;s gave me a curious in|&s;tance.</P>
<P>A lady, who&s;e education had been neglected in her youth, and who had arrived at a very ripe age, without perceiving any inconveniency from the ac|cident; had obtained, by the intere&s;t of &s;ome of her relations, a place at the court of Brun&s;wick. She had not been long there, before &s;he perceived that the conver&s;ation in the duche&s;s's apartment fre|quently
<PB N="254" REF="276">
turned on &s;ubjects of which &s;he was entirely ignorant, and that tho&s;e ladies had mo&s;t of her royal highne&s;s's ear, who were be&s;t acquainted with books. She regretted, for the fir&s;t time, the neglect of her own education; and although &s;he had hitherto con|&s;idered that kind of knowledge which is derived from reading, as unbecoming a woman of quality, yet, as it was now fa&s;hionable at court, &s;he re&s;olved to &s;tudy hard, that &s;he might get to the top of the mode as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>She mentioned this re&s;olution to the duche&s;s, de&s;ir|ing, at the &s;ame time, that her highne&s;s would lend her a book to begin. The duche&s;s applauded her de&s;ign, and promi&s;ed to lend her one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful books in her library. It was a French and German dictionary. Some days after her highne&s;s enquired how &s;he reli&s;hed her book. Infinitely, replied the &s;tu|dious lady; it is the mo&s;t delightful book I ever read. The &s;entences are all &s;hort and ea&s;ily under&s;tood, and the letters charmingly arranged in ranks, like &s;oldiers on the parade; whereas in &s;ome other books which I have &s;een, they are mingled together in a confu&s;ed manner, like a mere mob, &s;o that it is very difficult to know what they mean. But I am no longer &s;ur|prized, added &s;he, at the &s;atisfaction your royal high|ne&s;s has in &s;tudy.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="277">The academy at Brun&s;wick has been new modelled, and the plan of education improved by the attention, and under the patronage of the hereditary prince, who married the &s;i&s;ter of <HI>George</HI> III. of England. Stu|dents re&s;ort to this academy from many parts of Germany, and there are generally &s;ome young gen|tlemen from Britain, who are &s;ent here to be edu|cated.</P>
<P>Such of them as are intended for a military life, will not find &s;o many advantages united at any other place on the continent, as at the academy of Brun&s;|wick. They will be here under the protection of a fa|mily, particularly partial to the Briti&s;h nation: every branch of &s;cience is taught by ma&s;ters of known abili|ties; the young &s;tudent will &s;ee garri&s;on-duty regularly performed, and may, by the intere&s;t of the prince, often have liberty to attend the reviews of the Pru&s;|&s;ian troops at Magdeburg and Berlin. They will have few temptations to expence in a town where they can &s;ee no example of extravagance; have few opportu|nities of di&s;&s;ipation, and none of debauchery.</P>
<P>It is well known that the Germans are fond of ma&s;querades, and I am not, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Moore,</HI> &s;urprized at it, e&s;pecially among tho&s;e of high rank, being &s;o much harra&s;&s;ed by the ceremony and form, and cramped by the di&s;tance which birth throws between people who may have a mutual regard for each other.
<PB N="256" REF="278">
I imagine they are glad to &s;eize every opportunity of a&s;&s;uming the ma&s;k and domino, that they may ta&s;te the plea&s;ures of familiar connection and &s;ocial mirth. In company with the duke of Hamilton I once had the honour of dining at the hou&s;e of a general officer. His &s;i&s;ter did the honours of the table, and on the duke's expre&s;&s;ing his &s;urprize that he had never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een her at court, he was told &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly appear there, becau&s;e &s;he was not noble. This lady, however, was vi&s;ited at home by the &s;ove|reign, and every family of di&s;tinction, all of whom repined that the e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom of their country deprived the court of a per&s;on who&s;e character they valued &s;o highly. The general's rank in the army was a &s;ufficient pa&s;&s;port for him, and would have been for his wife, but was of no &s;ervice to his &s;i&s;ter, for this etiquette is ob&s;erved very rigidly with re&s;pect to the natives of Germany, though it is greatly relaxed to &s;trangers, particularly the Engli&s;h, who they ima|gine have le&s;s regard for birth and title than any other nation.</P>
<P>The Prince's title is only duke of Brun&s;wick and Luneburg, but his arms are more exten&s;ive, con|&s;i&s;ting of thirteen fields, with &s;uitable emblematical atchievements for &s;everal di&s;tricts be&s;ides tho&s;e now mentioned.</P>
<P>The principality of Wolfenbuttle is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a vote among the princes both in the college of the
<PB N="257" REF="279">
empire, and likewi&s;e in the diets of Lower Saxony, in each of which, by virtue of an agreement concluded in 1706, when the &s;eniority lies in the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick Wolfenbuttle, it precedes tho&s;e of the elector of Brun&s;wick and Luneburg, for Zell, Grubenhagen, and Calenburg, but otherwi&s;e comes after them. Further, the hou&s;e of Wolfenbuttle, when &s;enior, obtains the joint directory of the circle of Lower Saxony.</P>
<P>The military force, lately maintained by the Duke, con&s;i&s;ts generally of four regiments of foot, each of two battalions, a body of hor&s;e-guards, a regiment of dragoons, a militia regiment of five companies, each containing 128 men, with a corps of engineers and matro&s;&s;es. The invalids al&s;o form one regiment.</P>
<P>Brun&s;wick is a rich populous city, dealing largely in the articles of hides, butter, and mum. It was for|merly one of the Han&s;e-Towns, and an Imperial city, governed by its own magi&s;trates, but now their Duke is an ab&s;olute &s;overeign.</P>
<P>The town is of a &s;quare form, and upwards of three Engli&s;h miles in circumference. It has a citadel, erected by the Duke of Brun&s;wick Wolfenbuttle, when he conquered it in 1671. The Duke's palace and the Stadthou&s;e are magnificent buildings; the former of which is &s;urrounded by a fo&s;&s;e, and contains
<PB N="258" REF="280">
a great number of apartments. The walls of every room are hung with prints, from the roof to within two feet of the floor. Perhaps there is not, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Moore,</HI> a more complete collection of framed ones in any private hou&s;e or palace in the world.</P>
<P>In the &s;quare before the ca&s;tle is a famous &s;tone &s;tatue, with a lion made of block tin, done after life, with great exactne&s;s. In the ar&s;enal is a curious gun, ten feet &s;ix inches long, and nine feet two inches in diameter, which is an unparalleled piece of ordnance, capable of carrying a ball 750lb. weight to a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Brun&s;wick is the rendezvous of the German Free|ma&s;ons, at the head of whom is the Prince; indeed mo&s;t of the prote&s;tant princes in Germany are mem|bers of this numerous order, and it is allowed that it has made many of them more affable and gentle in their manners. Four princes of this illu&s;trious hou&s;e fought in the la&s;t Sile&s;ian war for the honour and free|dom of Germany; the younge&s;t of them only 17 years of age died, covered with wounds, under a heap of hu&s;&s;ars, who had been the witne&s;&s;es of his valour, and whom he comforted to his late&s;t breath. This is the elder branch of the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick, and the King of England is de&s;cended from a younger &s;on. The pre&s;ent Duke is married to the &s;i&s;ter of <HI>George</HI> III. of Great Britain, and is allowed to be one of the
<PB N="259" REF="281">
fir&s;t generals of the Ru&s;&s;ian army, and to have the fir&s;t talents for conducting an army.</P>
<P>Being now in the north of Germany, I cannot but ob&s;erve from the general accounts of all travellers, that though the German ladies in the north are, as the women of Florence in the &s;outh, far &s;uperior to all their countrywomen in life and &s;pirit; yet the ideal beauty which dances before the eyes of our arti&s;ts, and &s;o often vani&s;hes under their pencils, was never taken from Germany; for all the human figures you meet with between Brun&s;wick and the northern and ea&s;tern &s;eas, are &s;o far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it, that there are no lines of it to be di&s;cerned among them.</P>
<P>In vain would you look for a girl's body re&s;em|bling the Grecian model. There are, it is true, faces enough with very &s;oft &s;trokes in them, but they all want the Greek profile and &s;pirit; nor has the fine white fle&s;h the firmne&s;s in&s;eparable from a truly fine form. In the lower parts of the Elbe and We&s;er, we &s;ee, indeed, &s;ome &s;now bo&s;oms, and &s;ome lily and ro&s;y cheeks, but they &s;oon vani&s;h when the girls have once pa&s;&s;ed their bloom; and the white is &s;o flat and lifele&s;s, that you cannot give it the name of a fine form. Even among the Saxons, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> the faire&s;t creatures under the &s;un, who are not Grecians, we &s;eldom meet with a face which has any appearance of ideal beauty.</P>

<P>Next to the electors of the empire, the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el is one of the greate&s;t princes in Ger|many, and even of tho&s;e, the electors of Bohemia, Bavaria, Saxony, and Hanover only, are richer and more powerful than he; the Landgravate of He&s;&s;e alone, is above 80 miles long. This country is in ge|neral hilly, with a great deal of wood, but inter&s;per&s;ed with fertile vallies and corn fields. The large &s;ub&s;i|dies this court received from Great Britain, during the late wars, with what is given in time of peace, by way of retaining fee, greatly contributed to the pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing &s;tate of its finances.</P>
<P>The reigning Prince for&s;ook the prote&s;tant faith in 1749, and made a public profe&s;&s;ion of the Romi&s;h re|ligion in the life of his father. This gave great unea|&s;ine&s;s to the old prince, and alarmed his &s;ubjects, who are all prote&s;tants. The &s;tates were a&s;&s;embled on this important occa&s;ion, and mea&s;ures were taken to main|tain the religious con&s;titution of the country again&s;t any future attempts to &s;ubvert them. The hereditary prince was excluded from all the&s;e in the education of
<PB N="262" REF="285">
his &s;ons, who were put under the tuition of his fir&s;t wife, daughter of <HI>George</HI> II. of England, being at that time &s;eparated from her hu&s;band. The elde&s;t &s;on on his father's acce&s;&s;ion to the Landgravate, was put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the county of Hanau, &s;o that the people have felt no inconveniency from the change of their Prince's religion; and as he him&s;elf has reaped no earthly advantage, either in point of profit or honour, by his renouncing, it is pre&s;umed, his highne&s;s's hopes are now limited to the rewards which may await him in the other world.</P>
<P>The number of his &s;ubjects is about 330,000, the pari&s;h pa&s;tors are about 320, and his income amounts to about 220,000l. &s;terling; add to this the county of Hanau, which contains 100,000 men, and brings in about 50,000l. a year. The univer&s;ity of Marburg al&s;o belongs to him.</P>
<P>He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el is the mo&s;t military country of all Ger|many; the pea&s;ants are not only in continual di&s;ci|pline, but always ready to march any where through the wide world. Sending the He&s;&s;ian troops to Ame|rica, cannot be con&s;idered as a hard&s;hip in it&s;elf, con|&s;idering its intimate connection with Great-Britain; but it was a very unprofitable one for He&s;&s;e. The Engli&s;h &s;ub&s;idies can never make amends for the lo&s;s which the treaty has brought hitherto both on prince and people. The country was &s;tripped of all its
<PB N="263" REF="286">
young men, after the la&s;t Sile&s;ian war; and &s;carcely had it began to bloom again, when they were &s;ent to America. At lea&s;t 20,000 He&s;&s;ians, of whom one half will never come home, are gone to that part of the world. The country has therefore lo&s;t a &s;ixth of its mo&s;t u&s;eful inhabitants by the tea-burning bu&s;i|ne&s;s at Bo&s;ton. The taxes being very con&s;iderable, the people de&s;ert in great numbers, and go into Hun|gary, Poland and Turkey.</P>
<P>The military con&s;titution of He&s;&s;e has, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, been as u&s;eful to the German empire in general, as it has been prejudicial to the people them|&s;elves. So early as the reformation, the He&s;&s;ians con|tributed exceedingly towards maintaining the freedom of the empire, and the Sile&s;ian war would not have ended nearly &s;o well for England, or the king of Pru&s;|&s;ia, if 16, or 18,000 brave He&s;&s;ians had not &s;tood the brunt.</P>
<P>This prince keeps on foot 16,000 men in time of peace, di&s;ciplined according to the Pru&s;&s;ian plan, the Landgrave him&s;elf, in 1770, having the rank of field-mar&s;hal in the Pru&s;&s;ian army. Dr. <HI>Moore</HI> tells us, that when he was there, which was about twenty years ago, the prince was &s;o fond of exerci&s;ing his men, that in bad weather he would have two or three hun|dred of the fir&s;t battalion of guards in the dining room of his palace, and there make them go through their manoeuvres.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="287">During the life-time of Prince <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> the here|ditary prince re&s;ided at Hanau. He lived there in a &s;tate of independency, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the revenues of that country, guaranteed to him by the kings of Great-Britain, Denmark, and Pru&s;&s;ia. The prince was not on the be&s;t terms with his father, and there was no inter|cour&s;e between this little court and that of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el and Darm&s;tadt formerly belonged to one prince, being divided between the &s;ons of one man; they are now the property of two families, but that of He&s;&s;e Darm&s;tadt has the primogeniture. Many articles however are &s;till common between the two princes. He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el con&s;tantly keeps on foot 12 battalions and eight &s;quadrons, which are reckoned as &s;o many regiments, a troop of hu&s;&s;ars, and 300 ma|tro&s;&s;es. He&s;&s;e-Darm&s;tadt maintains a body of hor&s;e-guards, two companies of grenadier-guards, two &s;quadrons of dragoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, two regiments of infantry, and four battalions of regular militia. The inhabi|tants of He&s;&s;e-Darm&s;tadt are prote&s;tants, as well as tho&s;e of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el. The univer&s;ities of Marburg a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">intein belong to He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, that of Gei&s;&s;en, to the Hou&s;e of Darm&s;tadt, and the prince of Darm|&s;tadt has about half the revenue of the prince of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el. The prince of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el re&s;ides at Ca&s;&s;el, the prince of He&s;&s;e-Darm&s;tadt, at Darm&s;tadt.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="288">The city of Ca&s;&s;el is &s;ituated on the river Fulda. It con&s;i&s;ts of an old and new town; the river divides them, over which is a &s;tone bridge. The old town, which is the large&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable, forms a &s;emicircle on a hill, and, like the lower new town, is old fa&s;hioned; but the French, or upper new town, betwixt which and the old town lies the e&s;planade, being delightfully planted with rows of trees, is very regular and hand&s;ome. The &s;treets are beautiful, but not over-crouded with inhabitants. Here the nobility and officers of the court have their re&s;i|dence.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the large chateau in the town of Ca&s;&s;el, which is the Landgrave's winter-re&s;idence, he has &s;eve|ral villas and ca&s;tles in different parts of his domi|nions. Immediately without the town there is a very beautiful building, in which he dwells for the mo&s;t part of the &s;ummer; the apartments here are neat and commodious, &s;ome of them adorned with an|tique &s;tatues of con&s;iderable value. Round the pa|lace are &s;ome noble parks and gardens, with a very complete orangery and a menagerie, with a con&s;ider|able collection of curious animals. In the Lycaeum is an anatomical theatre, a cabinet of natural cu|rio&s;ities, and an ob&s;ervatory well furni&s;hed with in|&s;truments. Among their curio&s;ities they have a &s;word which was con&s;ecrated by the pope, and &s;ent to
<PB N="266" REF="289">
one of the princes of this family, at his &s;etting out on an expedition to the holy land.</P>
<P>Near the old chateau, and a little to one &s;ide, is a colonade of &s;mall pillars, lately built, and intended as an ornament to the ancient ca&s;tle, though in a very different &s;tyle of architecture. The &s;limne&s;s of their form appears the more remarkable on account of their vicinity to this Gothic &s;tructure. I mention this to introduce an anecdote.</P>
<P>Some time &s;ince, a mountebank came to Ca&s;&s;el, who, be&s;ides many wonderful feats, pretended that he could &s;wallow and dige&s;t &s;tones. A He&s;&s;ian offi|cer, walking before the chateau, with an Engli&s;h gen|tleman who then happened to be at Ca&s;&s;el, a&s;ked him, what he thought of the fine new colonade? It is very fine, indeed, replied the &s;tranger; but, if you wi&s;h it to be durable, take care not to &s;uffer your mounte|bank to walk this way before breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Nothing in the country of He&s;&s;e is more worthy of the admiration of travellers, than the Gothic tem|ple and ca&s;cade at Wa&s;en&s;tein; there was originally, at this place, an old building u&s;ed by the princes of this family as a kind of hunting-hou&s;e. It is &s;ituated at the bottom of a high mountain, on the face of which is a &s;eries of artificial cataracts, ca&s;cades, and
<PB N="267" REF="290">
various kinds of water-works, in the noble&s;t &s;tile that can be conceived.</P>
<P>The principal ca&s;cades are in the middle; and, on each &s;ide, are &s;tairs of large black &s;tones of a flinty texture, brought from a rock at a con&s;iderable di|&s;tance. Each of the&s;e &s;tairs con&s;i&s;ts of 800 &s;teps from the bottom to the &s;ummit of the mountain; and when the works are allowed to play, the water flowing over them forms two continued chains of &s;maller ca&s;|cades. At convenient di&s;tances, as you a&s;cend, are four platforms, with a &s;pacious ba&s;on in each, al&s;o grottoes and caves, ornamented with &s;hell-work, &s;ta|tues of Na&iuml;ads and &s;ea-divinities. The water ru&s;hes from the &s;ummit of this mountain in various &s;hapes: &s;ometimes in detached ca&s;cades; &s;ometimes in large &s;heets, like broad chry&s;talline rivers; at one place it is broken by a rock con&s;i&s;ting of huge &s;tones. There are al&s;o fountains which eject the water in columns of five or &s;ix inches diameter to a con&s;iderable height: all this has a very brilliant effect when viewed from the bottom.</P>
<P>On the highe&s;t part of the mountain a Gothic temple is built; and on the top of that, an obeli&s;k, crowned by a Colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue of Hercules, leaning on his club, in the attitude of the Farne&s;e Hercules. This figure is of copper, and 30 feet in height; there is a &s;tair-ca&s;e within the club, by which a man may
<PB N="268" REF="291">
a&s;cend, and have a view of the country from a win|dow at the top.</P>
<P>Wa&s;en&s;tein, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> is, upon the whole, infi|nitely the noble&s;t work of the kind I ever &s;aw; and he had travelled over the greate&s;t part of Europe. I have been a&s;&s;ured, continues he, there is nothing equal to it. It has not the air of a modern work, but rather conveys the idea of Roman magnificence.</P>
<P><HI>Moore</HI> was at this court about 20 years &s;ince, with the duke of Hamilton, and gives us the following relation of their &s;tile of living there for one day; which, with little variations, will an&s;wer for other days; and as all the German courts endeavour to imi|tate each other, it will &s;erve to &s;hew how young no|blemen generally &s;pend their time in travel. We went, &s;ays he, to the palace, about half an hour be|fore dinner was &s;erved, where we found all the offi|cers that were united, a&s;&s;embled in a large room. The Landgrave &s;oon appeared, and continued conver&s;ing with the company till his con&s;ort, and the ladies with her, arrived. The company then walked to the dining-parlour, where there were about 30 covers every day, and the &s;ame number in an adjoining room. The doors being left open be|tween the&s;e apartments, the whole formed, in a man|ner, but one company. The repa&s;t continued about two hours, during which, the conver&s;ation was car|ried
<PB N="269" REF="292">
on with &s;ome little appearance of con&s;traint, and rather in a low voice; except when either of their highne&s;&s;es &s;poke to any per&s;on &s;eated at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>After dinner the company returned to the room where they fir&s;t a&s;&s;embled. In this they remained till the Landgrave retired, which he u&s;ually did within a quarter of an hour; &s;oon after the company &s;epa|rated till &s;even in the evening; when they again a&s;|&s;embled, and cards were then introduced, and gam|ing continued about two hours. The Landgrave then &s;aluted her highne&s;s on both cheeks, and retired to his own apartment, whil&s;t &s;he and the re&s;t of the company went to &s;upper. At this repa&s;t there was le&s;s formality, and, of cour&s;e, more ea&s;e and gaiety than at dinner.</P>
<P>When her highne&s;s ro&s;e from table, mo&s;t of the company attended her up &s;tairs to a &s;pacious anti|chamber, where &s;he remained conver&s;ing a few mi|nutes, and then retired. The&s;e general forms were &s;ometimes varied by a concert in the Landgrave's apartments. There were al&s;o certain days of gala, di&s;tingui&s;hed only by the company's being more nu|merous and better dre&s;&s;ed than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>During the carnival there were two or three ma&s;|querades. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, the court a&s;&s;embled about &s;ix in the evening, the men being all in do|minos
<PB N="270" REF="293">
and the ladies in their u&s;ual dre&s;s, or with the addition of a few fanciful ornaments. They amu&s;ed them&s;elves with cards and conver&s;ation till &s;upper. During this interval, a gentleman of the court carried a parcel of tickets on his hat, equal to the number of men in company. The&s;e were pre|&s;ented to the ladies, each of whom drew one. Tickets, in the &s;ame manner, were pre&s;ented to the men, who drew likewi&s;e, keeping their tickets till cards were over. The officer then called number one, on which the couple who drew that number came forward, and the gentleman led the lady into the &s;upper-room, &s;at by her, and was her partner for the re&s;t of the evening. In like manner every other number was called.</P>
<P>After &s;upper all the company put on their ma&s;ks; her highne&s;s was led into the ball-room; the re&s;t followed, each lady handed in by her partner. The landgravine and her partner walked to the upper end of the room; the next couple &s;topped at a &s;mall di|&s;tance below them; the third next to the &s;econd, and &s;o on, till this double file reached the whole length of the room. From this arrangement one would na|turally expect a country dance. No, a minuet is all. The mu&s;ic began; and all the ma&s;kers, con&s;i&s;ting of 20 or 30 couple, walked a minuet together. This being over, which was rather a confu&s;ed affair, every one &s;at down, the landgravine excepted, who generally
<PB N="271" REF="294">
danced nine or ten minuets &s;ucce&s;&s;ively with as many different gentlemen. She then took her &s;eat till the re&s;t of the company had danced minuets; which be|ing over, cotillons and country-dances begun and continued till four or five in the morning.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the company who &s;upped at court, the rooms were generally crowded with ma&s;ks from the town, &s;ome of whom were in fancy dre&s;&s;es, and kept them&s;elves concealed all the time; and although tho&s;e who came from the court were known when they en|tered the ball-rooms, many of them &s;lipped out af|terwards and changed their dre&s;&s;es and returned to amu&s;e them&s;elves by tea&s;ing their friends in their a&s;|&s;umed characters, as is u&s;ual at ma&s;querades.</P>
<P>The country-dances were compo&s;ed of all per&s;ons, promi&s;cuou&s;ly, who were inclined to join in them. Two women of plea&s;ure who had come to pa&s;s the carnival at Ca&s;&s;el, in the exerci&s;e of their profe&s;&s;ion, and were well known to many of the officers, danced every ma&s;querade night in the country-dance which her highne&s;s led down: for the ma&s;k annihilates ce|remony, puts every one on a footing, and not unfre|quently, while it conceals the face mo&s;t effectually, &s;erves the more to di&s;cover the real character and in|clinations of the wearer.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="295">The playhou&s;e is neat, though &s;mall. The front gallery, with a convenient room behind, is appro|priated to the court. When the prince or prince&s;s &s;tands up, whether between the acts, or during the repre&s;entation, all the audience do the &s;ame. From the arrival of the company of French comedians, who remain &s;ix weeks or two months, the court has a new re&s;ource. The Landgrave pays them a &s;tipulated &s;um for acting twice a week during that time; and they have &s;carce any emolument be&s;ides; for the people of Ca&s;&s;el, who are Calvini&s;ts, &s;hew no great pa&s;&s;ion for dramatic entertainments.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the players are here, the gala-days are more frequent and brilliant. I ob&s;erved, continues the &s;ame author, two per&s;ons in the drawing room &s;a|luting each other with great politene&s;s and apparent regard; but neither of them was a He&s;&s;ian, a little after one of them touched my &s;houlder, and, pointing to the other, whi&s;pered in my ear, <HI>Prenez garde, Mon&s;ieur, de cet homme, c'e&s;t un grand Coquin.</HI> The other, within a few minutes, came up to me, &s;aying, <HI>Croyez vous, Mon&s;ieur, que vous pui&s;&s;iez reconnoitre un fou, &s;i je vous le r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mtrois? Le voil&agrave;,</HI> added he, &s;hewing the per&s;on who had whi&s;pered me before. I have been &s;ince told, by tho&s;e who knew both, that each had hit exactly upon the other's character.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="296">This little trait I have related merely on account of its &s;ingularity, and to &s;hew how very different the manners of this court and the &s;entiments of the cour|tiers here, with regard to each other, are from tho&s;e of St. James's.</P>
<P>The He&s;&s;ians, &s;ays Baron <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> take them in ge|neral, are deformed to a degree. The women are the uglie&s;t creatures I ever &s;aw; their dre&s;s is horrid. Mo&s;t of them are clad in black, and wear their pet|ticoats &s;o high, that you can &s;ee no &s;hape,&mdash;the ugly thick leg, as high as the knee, is mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous. The men, in &s;ome degree, make up in &s;trength, what is wanting in beauty. Upon the whole, though not a large, they are a &s;tout &s;trong-built people. Here and there you &s;ee a gigantic figure; but they have all large bodies and large feet. Mo&s;t of them are white, and their hair is cri&s;p. Their way of living is &s;uch, that their be&s;t food is potatoes and brandy, which la&s;t they give even to their chil|dren.</P>
<P>The people are much the &s;ame in the Fulde&s;e. The whole tract of country, from Ca&s;&s;el to the bor|ders of Franconia, is rough and wild. The people are like the country, which abounds in woods and hills.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="297">The abbot or Prince of Fulda, calls the pope his brother. He is, without doubt, the riche&s;t abbot in the catholic world; the number of his &s;ubjects amount to 700,000; and he has an income of thirty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. The palace of Fulda is a very pretty building, and not without good com|pany. The Abbot has e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;everal u&s;eful e&s;ta|bli&s;hments for education, and allows his eccle&s;ia&s;tics a freedom in &s;peaking and writing, which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from tho&s;e of the other parts of Germany.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this tolerant &s;pirit and knowledge, the prie&s;thood are far beyond their brethren of Au|&s;tria and Bavaria, but there are &s;ome exceptions to the general character. <HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> &s;ays, he was &s;peaking to a prie&s;t here about the exclu&s;ion of witches, with which this government has been &s;o often and &s;o ju&s;tly re|proached, that he did not at fir&s;t &s;eem to under&s;tand him; but at la&s;t replied, with a confidential air, that the mo&s;t intelligent per&s;ons were not &s;atisfied with the grounds of trial; as &s;everal learned divines had determined, that the woman who had been lately burnt for a witch, might have been <HI>Ob&s;e&s;&s;a,</HI> as well as <HI>circumce&s;&s;a,</HI> by the devil; as much as to &s;ay, that the devil was not ab&s;olutely in the circumference of her body; but that Satan, in order to play her into the hands of ju&s;tice, made the miracles &s;eem to come from her belly, and blinded the &s;pectators at her co&s;t; and the &s;ame author a&s;&s;ures, as they told him
<PB N="275" REF="298">
at Wurtzburg, with a &s;erious, confidential face, that the watch cannot be &s;et, in a certain &s;treet, between 11 and 12 at night, on account of a very dangerous man walking at this time through it, who carries his body under his right arm.</P>
<P>Darm&s;tadt, the re&s;idence of the prince of He&s;&s;e Darm&s;tadt, is &s;eated on a river of the &s;ame name in a fruitful and plea&s;ant country. Its fertility may be in|ferred from the largene&s;s of a&s;paragus. <HI>Key&s;ler</HI> &s;aw a head that weighed half a pound. The gardeners in Au&s;tria lay &s;mall &s;ticks over the beds when they be|gin to &s;hoot, to &s;helter them from the weather and cold winds. Darm&s;tadt contains a new palace, one church, the burial-place of the family, a regency, a court of appeals, a con&s;i&s;tory, a criminal court, a grammar &s;chool, and an orphan-hou&s;e. There is no regular fortification round the town, but a very high &s;tone wall, not &s;o much to defend it again&s;t an enemy, as to prevent de&s;ertion; for the &s;oldiers &s;eemed to take no delight in the warlike amu&s;ements which con&s;ti|tuted the &s;upreme joy of the Prince.</P>
<P>Centinels (<HI>Moore</HI> tells us, when he was there) were placed, at &s;mall di&s;tances, all round the wall; who were obliged to be extremely alert. One &s;ol|dier gave the words, <HI>all is well,</HI> in German, to his neighbour on the right, who immediately called the &s;ame to the centinel beyond him; and &s;o it went
<PB N="276" REF="299">
round till the fir&s;t &s;oldier received it from the left, which he tran&s;mitted to the right, as formerly; and &s;o the call circulated, without intermi&s;&s;ion, through the whole night. Every other part of garri&s;on-duty is performed with equal exactne&s;s, and all neglects as &s;everely puni&s;hed, as if an enemy was at the gates.</P>
<P>The men are &s;eldom in bed more than two nights out of the three. This, with the attention requi&s;ite to keep their clothes and accoutrements clean, is very hard duty, e&s;pecially when the fro&s;t is uncommonly keen, as it often is, and the ground covered with &s;now. The Prince has a &s;mall body of cavalry, dre&s;|&s;ed in buff coats, and magnificently accoutred; the&s;e are his hor&s;e-guards; and they are all not le&s;s in height than &s;ix feet three inches Engli&s;h; &s;everal of them con&s;iderably above it.</P>
<P>The Prince of He&s;&s;e Darm&s;tadt formerly kept a greater number of troops; at pre&s;ent, his whole army does not exceed 5000; and there are tho&s;e who blame him for keeping &s;o many; as an army of 5000 men, though &s;ufficient to burthen the country, is not &s;ufficient to defend it; as the number is far too great for amu&s;ement, and infinitely too &s;mall for any manner of u&s;e; as his finances are too much di&s;ordered to &s;upport &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment; and as agriculture and manufactures mu&s;t &s;uffer by
<PB N="277" REF="300">
taking away the &s;toute&s;t men and exhau&s;ting their &s;trength in u&s;ele&s;s parade.</P>
<P>The parade is an object of great attention at this place. Prince <HI>George</HI> has a mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic pa&s;&s;ion for military manoeuvres and evolutions. Drilling and exerci&s;ing his &s;oldiers are his chief amu&s;ement; and almo&s;t his whole employ; and that he may enjoy this in all kinds of weather and at every &s;ea&s;on of the year, he has built a room &s;ufficiently capacious to admit 1500 men to perform their exerci&s;e in it alto|gether. This room is accommodated with 16 &s;toves, by which it may be kept at the exact degrees of tem|perature, which &s;uits his highne&s;s's con&s;titution. The Darm&s;tadt &s;oldiers are tall, tolerably well clothed, and, above all things, remarkably well powdered. They go through their exerci&s;e with that dexterity which may be expected of men who are con&s;tantly em|ployed in the &s;ame action, under the eye of their prince, who is an admirable judge and &s;evere critic in this part of the military art.</P>
<P>Darm&s;tadt, &s;ays Baron <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> is a &s;mall, but lovely place, where there is charming &s;ociety. If it depended upon my&s;elf to fix the place of my abode, I do not know where I &s;hould pitch my tent &s;o wil|lingly as here. You are in the mid&s;t of &s;everal large cities not far di&s;tant from each other. The air is good, provi&s;ions are cheap, and you have it always in your
<PB N="278" REF="301">
power to unite the city and country life. Add to this, the popularity of the court, the delicate Engli&s;h garden open to every one, the magnificent parade, the number of agreeable women and the hunting-parties, which are to be made at no great expence, render it a mo&s;t de&s;irable habitation.</P>
<P>Some di&s;tricts of this country are uncommonly fruitful; the a&s;paragus of Darm&s;tadt are famous all over Germany for their &s;ize and beauty; at &s;everal places they make a tolerable wine. The little hamlet of Gerau &s;ells from four to five thou&s;and guilder's worth of cabbage, every year. The villages here have an uncommon neat and gay a&s;pect. The pea|&s;ants are a &s;trong and hand&s;ome race of men, well boned and well &s;inewed. Better or more active troops than the three Darm&s;tadt regiments of infantry are not to be &s;een in Germany; nor are they to be pur|cha&s;ed as the troops of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The farms between this and Frankfort would pa&s;s for towns in Bavaria or the north of Germany. They all be&s;peak a high &s;tate of opulence in the inhabitants. The beggary we occa&s;ionally &s;ee, are the con&s;equence of the way of thinking of the German-catholics, who are liberal to a degree; and if there were not &s;o many givers, the beggars would learn to work. A pea&s;ant is, in general, extremely happy throughout the whole country. He is almo&s;t every where a freeman and
<PB N="279" REF="302">
oppre&s;&s;ed with no hard taxes. The earth yields un|common returns, and the corn of this country is ex|ported, far and wide, on the Rhine.</P>
<P>The duke of Hamilton accompanied a nobleman to his country-&s;eat near Darm&s;tadt. The carriage was of a peculiar con&s;truction. The nobleman &s;at on a low &s;eat next the hor&s;e; the duke on a higher place, behind him. Each of the&s;e is made for one per&s;on alone; but, behind all, there was a wooden &s;eat, in the &s;hape of a little hor&s;e, on which two &s;er|vants were mounted. The u&s;ual po&s;t-chai&s;es in this country hold &s;ix per&s;ons with ea&s;e; and per&s;ons even of the fir&s;t rank have generally two or three &s;ervants in the chai&s;e with them. In point of oeconomy, the&s;e carriages are well imagined, and, in time of fro&s;t, not inconvenient; for here travellers take &s;pecial care to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the cold, by cloaks lined with fur. But when it rains hard, two of the com|pany, at lea&s;t, mu&s;t be drenched; for the German chai&s;es are never entirely covered over.</P>
<P>The contra&s;t of character between the French and German is &s;trongly illu&s;trated in the behaviour of the po&s;tillions of the two countries. A French po&s;tillion is generally either laughing or fretting, or &s;inging, or &s;wearing, all the time he is on the road. If a hill, or a bad road, oblige him to go &s;low, he will, of a &s;udden, crack his whip over his head for a quarter of
<PB N="280" REF="303">
an hour together, without rhime or rea&s;on; for he knows the hor&s;es cannot go fa&s;ter, and he does not intend they &s;hould. All this noi&s;e and emotion, therefore, means nothing; and proceeds entirely from that abhorrence of quiet which every French|man &s;ucks in with his mother's milk. A German po&s;tillion, on the contrary, drives four hor&s;es with all po&s;&s;ible tranquillity. He neither &s;ings nor frets, nor laughs nor &s;wears; he only &s;mokes; and when he comes near a narrow defile, &s;ounds his trumpet to prevent any carriage from entering, at the other end, till he has got through. If you call to him, to go fa&s;ter, he turns about, looks you in the face, takes his pipe from his mouth, and &s;ays, <HI>yaw, Mynheer, yaw, yaw;</HI> and then proceeds exactly in the &s;ame pace as before. He is no way affected, whether the road be good or bad; whether it rains, or &s;hines, or &s;nows: and he &s;eems regardle&s;s of the per&s;ons whom he drives, and equally callous to their reproach or applau&s;e. He has one object, of which he never lo&s;es &s;ight, which is, to conduct your chai&s;e and its contents from one part to another, in the manner he thinks be&s;t for him&s;elf and the hor&s;es. And unle&s;s his pipe goes out (in which ca&s;e, he &s;trikes his flint, and rekindles it) he &s;eems not to have another idea, during the whole journey; your be&s;t cour&s;e is to let him have his own way at fir&s;t, for it will come to that at la&s;t. All your noi&s;e and blu&s;ter are vain.</P>

<P>In 1731, <HI>Key&s;ler</HI> &s;aw a very &s;trong &s;tag-hart that drew in a chai&s;e, and five others, bridled and put to a coach, which were as tractable as &s;o many hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Frankfort on the Maine is a free Imperial city, the u&s;ual place of the election and coronation of the kings of the Romans, the place where the &s;tates of the Rhine-circles meet, one of the four lege&s;tadts in Ger|many, and celebrated for its commerce. It lies in a delightful, fertile and healthy country along the Maine, which divides it into two parts. Frankfort and Sach&s;enhau&s;en, the former being the large&s;t, is divided into 12 wards; the latter into two. Both are reckoned to contain 3000 hou&s;es, large and &s;mall, and not a few of them modern; &s;ome of them are rather &s;tately palaces, particularly the palace of the prince de la Tours and the German hou&s;e, an augu&s;t edifice near the bridge, which is 400 feet long, &s;upport|ed on 14 wide arches. It has three principal &s;quares; in one is the town-hou&s;e, an old-fa&s;hioned building, the fore-part of which is &s;upported by arches; under
<PB N="282" REF="305">
it, in fair-time, are a number of toy-&s;hops. Over the&s;e arches is a &s;tall, where the Emperor u&s;ually dines after his coronation, and into which opens the cham|ber, where the election of a new chamber is can|va&s;&s;ed. Among the archives of the town-hou&s;e is kept the celebrated golden bull of the emperor Charles IV, which is a parchment book of 43 quarto leaves, containing the fundamental in&s;titutes of the empire, written in Latin capitals; which famous piece is kept in a tortoi&s;hell bag, &s;et with mother of pearl and lined with yellow velvet; a &s;ight of it co&s;ts a ducat.</P>
<P>A countryman of our's, who expected more amu&s;e|ment for his money, complained loudly of this as an impo&s;ition; and on hearing a German talk of the high price every thing bore in England, retorted on him in the&s;e words. <HI>Il n'y a rien en Angleterre &s;i cher que votre taureau d'or &agrave; Frankfort.</HI></P>
<P>The hor&s;e-market, one of the &s;quares is laid out in walks and rows of trees. In the town are three ar|&s;enals. The magi&s;trates and city officers profe&s;s Lutherani&s;m, which is the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion; but mo&s;t of the churches, and tho&s;e too the chief, are in the hands of the catholics. French and German Cal|vini&s;ts are very numerous here, and are doubtle&s;s the riche&s;t of the inhabitants; but the inqui&s;itorial &s;tate of the Lutheran clergy will not allow them a church;
<PB N="283" REF="306">
and they are forced to go three miles out of town, every Sunday morning throughout the year, to wor|&s;hip. There is a common &s;aying at Frankfort, "that the Roman-catholics have the churches; the Lutherans, the magi&s;trates, and the Calvini&s;ts, the money." The number of coaches that attend on a Sunday morning, to carry the congregation, is about 250. Hackney-coaches are hired, by four per&s;ons, at ten guineas for the year. The Jews have a public and a very con&s;iderable &s;ynagogue, their number is about 6000; they are confined to a certain narrow &s;treet, built up at one end, with a gate at the other, and are regularly &s;hut up at a certain hour of the night. There are &s;ome who are worth a million, and vie with the chri&s;tians in every article of expence. Their indu&s;try is not to be conceived; they are pimps, language-ma&s;ters, fencing-ma&s;ters, dancing-ma&s;ters, writing and arithmetic ma&s;ters, and their daughters are at the &s;ervice of the uncircumci&s;ed. Tho&s;e who go into their &s;treet are in danger of being pre&s;&s;ed to death by them; they fall upon &s;trangers by dozens, and compel them to buy their wares. It is very difficult for a man to di&s;entangle him&s;elf from them, without the help of a good &s;tick, and they call to &s;trangers from the di&s;tance of three or four hundred paces. The hou&s;es of their well-encom|pa&s;&s;ed &s;treet are filled to the very top with inhabi|tants. In &s;even of them, which hardly occupied a &s;pace of 50 yards, and were burned down &s;ome years
<PB N="284" REF="307">
&s;ince, there were 1200 per&s;ons. But, on the other hand, there is often only one family in the hou&s;es be|longing to the rich. This is the &s;ign of an incre|dible affluence; for hou&s;e-rent is dearer in this &s;treet, than in any part of London, Paris, or any other great city. There is a law which forbids the Jews to live any where out of their own quarter, but the ma|gi&s;trate winks at the breaking it; and only renews it from time to time, to extort money from tho&s;e who chu&s;e to live el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The catholic foundations and convents are &s;ubject to the archbi&s;hopric of Mentz. In the cathedral of St. Bartholomew is a &s;mall chapel where the Emperor is elected. Two other churches are collegiate; in the whole there are about 12. The city is fortified, and it contains nine companies of &s;oldiers. It has &s;e|veral villages within its territory, and is governed by its own magi&s;tracy. It's yearly revenue is about 70,000l. &s;terling.</P>
<P>In the cathedral is a curious clock, con&s;i&s;ting of three parts; it is divided into &s;everal circles, &s;hewing the days and months, the golden number, the domi|nical letter, the age and change of the moon, the an|cient Roman calendar, the names of the apo&s;tles and martyrs, the length of the days and nights, the en|trance of the &s;un into the twelve &s;igns of the zodiac, the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the &s;un, the months, the &s;ea&s;ons,
<PB N="285" REF="308">
and the variable fea&s;ts. The figures which &s;trike the hours, repre&s;ent two &s;miths with hammers in their hands. This curious piece of clock-work was put up in 1605; and repaired, for the fir&s;t time, in 1704.</P>
<P>Cabinets of curio&s;ities are found in almo&s;t every con&s;iderable town in Germany; &s;o great a number of private collections are made. Strangers cannot pay their court better, to &s;uch collectors, than by reque&s;ting permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee their mu&s;eum; but the misfortune of attending them is, that the proprietor waits on you him&s;elf, and gives you the hi&s;tory of every piece of ore, petrefaction, and mon&s;ter he has; and as this lecture is given gratis, a&s;&s;umes the right of making it as long as he plea&s;es, till he quite tires you.</P>
<P>In the year 1731, when <HI>Key&s;ler</HI> was there, he &s;aw, in the cabinet of Dr. <HI>John Ki&s;mer,</HI> a learned phy&s;i|cian, who died in 1734, a very remarkable human &s;kull, which is &s;aid to have petrified on a gibbet; al&s;o the head of an elephant, dug up near Gotha in 1695, where the whole &s;keleton was found; it was at the depth of eleven ells, on an eminence, where the be&s;t white &s;and, for hour-gla&s;&s;es, is found. It had four large teeth, each weighed 12lb. and two horns, each four ells long. Where this extraordinary &s;keleton was dug, a large quantity of long and round &s;hells were found. A Frankfort ell is about two feet three inches.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="309">In a garden in this city is a hazel-tree, which the Frankfort chronicles make mention of 250 years ago; who&s;e trunk, in the lower part, is &s;even Frankfort ells in girth. Its height equal to that of the hou&s;es near it, and it has nuts every year; the &s;hells of the nuts are very thick, but the kernels like tho&s;e of other nuts. The emperor, <HI>Leopold</HI> I. dined twice under this tree. This &s;oil mu&s;t be particularly favourable to hazels, for though the adjacent grounds yield only common &s;hrubs, yet, <HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> &s;ays, four hazel trees, planted within 15 years, were then above 20 feet high. The above-mentioned old tree was beginning to decay in 1731.</P>
<P>The &s;treets of Frankfort are &s;pacious and well paved, the hou&s;es &s;tately, clean and convenient; the out&s;ides of them are very &s;plendid, and the &s;tyle of the architecture &s;hews that the inhabitants know how to lay out their money with ta&s;te. There are about thirty inhabitants in the place that are worth 50,000l. each, and there may be about 200 hou&s;es who have incomes of 10,000l. a-year and more: there is a high appearance of affluence throughout; the furniture of their hou&s;es, their gardens, their equipage, dre&s;s and female ornaments, every thing in &s;hort, be&s;peak a &s;tate above the ordinary citizen, approaching the extreme of magnificence. In a word, the air and genteel manners of the people &s;ufficiently &s;hew, without other information, that there is no little
<PB N="287" REF="310">
de&s;pot within their walls to impoveri&s;h them in &s;up|port of his grandeur, and to put every action of their lives, every movement of their bodies, under re&s;traint by his caprice.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es are of brick, but have a better appear|ance than brick hou&s;es in general, owing to their chiefly being covered with a kind of reddi&s;h &s;tucco lately come into u&s;e, and which it is thought will ren|der the buildings more durable. The fronts of many of the fine&s;t are al&s;o adorned with ba&s;s-reliefs of white &s;tucco, in imitation of marble; the&s;e white ornaments on the red ground form too &s;trong a contra&s;t, and do not plea&s;e an eye fond of &s;implicity, but the Germans in general have a ta&s;te for &s;hewy ornaments in their dre&s;s, furniture, and hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Though the principal church is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Roman-catholics, no proce&s;&s;ion of the Ho&s;t is permitted through the &s;treets, and the ceremonies of this religion is confined to hou&s;es of individuals, or performed within the walls of this church.</P>
<P>There is a cu&s;tom ob&s;erved here, which I &s;hall men|tion, on account of its &s;ingularity, though its origin cannot be learned; two women appear every day at noon on the battlements of the principal &s;teeple, and play &s;ome very &s;olemn airs with trumpets, their mu&s;ic is accompanied by vocal p&s;almody, performed by four
<PB N="288" REF="311">
or five men, who always attend the female trumpeters for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The people here have a great ta&s;te for p&s;alm-&s;ing|ing; there are a con&s;iderable number of men and boys who make it their only profe&s;&s;ion. They are engaged by &s;ome families to officiate two or three times a|week in the morning, before the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of the family ri&s;e. When any per&s;on in tolerable cir|cum&s;tances dies, a band of the&s;e &s;weet &s;ingers a&s;&s;emble in the &s;treets before the hou&s;e, and chaunt an hour every day to the corp&s;e till it is interred. The &s;ame band accompanies the funeral, &s;inging hymns all the way.</P>
<P>Funerals are conducted with an uncommon degree of &s;olemnity in this town, a man dre&s;&s;ed in a black cloak, and carrying a crucifix at the end of a long pole, leads the proce&s;&s;ion. A great number of hired mourners in the &s;ame dre&s;s, each with a lemon in his hand, march after him. Then come the &s;ingers followed by the corp&s;e in a hear&s;e, and la&s;tly the re|lations in mourning coaches. The crucifix is carried in this manner at all funerals, prote&s;tant or Roman-catholic.</P>
<P>Many of the Calvini&s;t families here are de&s;cendants of French prote&s;tants who left their country at the revolution of the edict of Nantz. There are &s;ome
<PB N="289" REF="312">
villages near Frankfort con&s;i&s;ting entirely of French refugees, who de&s;erting their country at the &s;ame time have &s;ettled here in clu&s;ters. Their de&s;cendants &s;peak French in their common conver&s;ation, and retain many of their original cu&s;toms to this hour. Two or three families now living at Frankfort are of Engli&s;h origin, their predece&s;&s;ors fir&s;t fled to Holland during the per&s;ecutions in the reign of Mary, and being after|wards driven out of that country by the cruelty of the Duke of Alva, found an a&s;ylum in this free Imperial city.</P>
<P>The Jews in Frankfort are obliged to fetch water when fire happens in any part of the city, and the magi&s;trates, in return, permit them to choo&s;e judges out of their own body for deciding di&s;putes among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Frankfort, &s;ays Baron <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> is a fine large city; there is no city in Germany which has larger and more magnificent inns. Excepting Hamburg, this is the only Imperial city which keeps up all its pri&s;tine &s;plendour. The inns, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Moore,</HI> for cleanline&s;s, conveniency and number of apartments, are &s;uperior to any I &s;aw on the continent, and vie with our mo&s;t magnificent inns in England; at the&s;e, as at all other inns in Germany and Switzerland, there is an ordinary at which &s;trangers may dine and &s;up. It is a true <HI>table d'h&ocirc;te,</HI> the landlord &s;itting at the bottom of the table,
<PB N="290" REF="313">
carving, which is not the ca&s;e in France; there is no private lodgings to be had here as at London, nor any <HI>h&ocirc;tels garnis,</HI> as at Paris; &s;trangers therefore are ob|liged to put up at inns, during their &s;tay in any of the towns, and travellers of every denomination in this country under the rank of &s;overeign princes, make no &s;cruple of eating occa&s;ionally at the <HI>table d'h&ocirc;te</HI> of the inn where they lodge; which cu&s;tom is univer&s;ally followed by &s;trangers from every country on the con|tinent of Europe; even ladies them&s;elves, in a journey, eat at the&s;e ordinaries, where all orders of &s;uperior rank are for the time laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>The celebrated colleges have a wonderful in&s;titu|tion. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t of a&s;&s;ociations of people of &s;ome rank, who a&s;&s;emble on a certain day. There are col|leges of nobility, of arti&s;ts of all kinds, of book|&s;ellers, of doctors of law and phy&s;ic; and, in &s;hort, of all orders. It is not difficult for a &s;tranger to be introduced to the&s;e; and the advantage he derives by it, of being acquainted, in an hour, with the mo&s;t re&s;pectable people of his own rank, is incredible.</P>
<P>Society here is divided into noble&s;&s;e and burgeois, the fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ome noble families from various parts of Germany, and who have cho&s;en this place for their re&s;idence, and &s;ome few original citizens of Frank|fort, who have now attained the rank of nobility, &s;ome of the&s;e nobility take pains to point out the e&s;&s;ential
<PB N="291" REF="314">
difference there is, and the di&s;tinction that ought to be, made between them and the burghers, who always, according to their opinion, retain a vulgarity of &s;en|ment and manners, unknown to tho&s;e who&s;e blood has poured through &s;everal generations, unmixed with that puddle which &s;tagnates in the veins of Ple|beians. But the Plebeians, in return, &s;mile at &s;uch noble&s;&s;e, and take pains, by a magnificent &s;hew, to convince the world they are the greate&s;t men of the two.</P>
<P><HI>Moore</HI> &s;ays, he was one day riding along the banks of the Maine, in the territories of the elector of Mentz, and ob&s;erved a building, which &s;eemed to be the re&s;idence of &s;ome prince, or &s;overeign bi&s;hop at lea&s;t; was &s;urpri&s;ed he had never heard it &s;poken of before, having a more magnificent appearance than any modern building he had &s;een &s;ince his arrival in Germany. He rode up, and on entering it, found that the apartments within, though not laid out in the be&s;t ta&s;te, &s;eemed to corre&s;pond, in point of expence, with the external appearance.</P>
<P>On enquiry, he was informed that this palace be|longed to a tobacconi&s;t in Frankfort, where he &s;till kept &s;hop, and had accumulated a prodigious fortune by making and &s;elling &s;nuff.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="315">Near to the principal hou&s;e was another great build|ing intended for a manufactory, with apartments for workmen, and vaulted cellars for &s;tore-hou&s;es. There were exactly 300 rooms in both buildings, and the greater number of them belonged to the dwelling-hou&s;es. The owner of the&s;e premi&s;es is an Italian, of the name of <HI>Bolongaro,</HI> and his &s;nuff is known by the &s;ame name; the government of Frankfort wanted to tax him as an out-burgher, and he was called on to lay an account of his property before the regency. He offered an immen&s;e &s;um of money, if they would take his word for the &s;um total; but nothing would &s;atisfy them but an exact inventory. This enraged him, and he withdrew him&s;elf into the territory of Mentz, to a place called Hoch&s;t, &s;ix miles from Frankfort. The con&s;equence of this is, that he now pays at lea&s;t 8000 guilders le&s;s to the cu&s;toms of Frankfort, than he did before, when his whole bu&s;i|ne&s;s was done in that city. The legi&s;lature of Mentz have built him a crane, on the Maine, before his pa|lace, and Mr. <HI>Bolongaro</HI> has carried his revenge &s;till further, by enticing one of the mo&s;t intelligent of his countrymen, out of one of the be&s;t hou&s;es in Frankfort, and entered into partner&s;hip with him, for e&s;tabli&s;hing a commerce in drugs, the mo&s;t ca|pital branch of trade in Frankfort. To encourage <HI>Bolongaro,</HI> the government of Mentz have granted him an exemption of cu&s;tom for 20 years, which &s;oon put 16,000l. into his pocket. Almo&s;t all
<PB N="293" REF="316">
his tobacco is prepared up the country; and even the greate&s;t part of it is exported from Frankfort, he only removed that part of his trade to Hoch&s;t, which he could not &s;o well carry on at Frankfort, and availed him&s;elf of the privileges of a citizen of Mentz, to hurt his former place of re&s;idence. This man is &s;uppo&s;ed to be worth 150,000l. &s;terling, and has &s;pent more than a third of the &s;um on his va&s;t pile of buildings.</P>
<P>There is a public a&s;&s;embly at Frankfort once a week for the nobility, at which they drink tea, con|ver&s;e, and play at cards from &s;ix till ten. On the other nights the &s;ame company meet alternately at each others hou&s;es, and pa&s;s the evening in the &s;ame manner. None of the burgeois families are invited to the&s;e parties; but they have a&s;&s;emblies of the &s;ame kind among them&s;elves, and often entertain their friends and &s;trangers in a very ho&s;pitable manner. The nobility who re&s;ide at Frankfort, and the nobi|lity of all degrees and every nation, who accidentally pa&s;s through it, chearfully accept of the&s;e invitations to dine with the citizens; but none of the German ladies of quality conde&s;cend &s;o far.</P>
<P>Di&s;tinction of ranks is ob&s;erved in Germany with all the &s;crupulous preci&s;ion, that a matter of that im|portance de&s;erves. There is a public concert in Frank|fort, &s;upported by &s;ub&s;cription. One would imagine that the &s;ub&s;cribers &s;hould take their &s;eats as they en|tered
<PB N="294" REF="317">
the room, and that tho&s;e who came earlie&s;t would have their choice as in England. No &s;uch thing. The fir&s;t two rows are kept for the ladies of quality; officers and daughters of the citizens mu&s;t be con|tented to &s;it behind. Whil&s;t <HI>Moore</HI> was there, the theatre was opened for the winter, by a troop of Ger|man comedians; he was pre&s;ent the fir&s;t night, and, previous to the play, there was a kind of allegorical compliment to the magi&s;trates of the place. This was performed by <HI>Ju&s;tice, Wi&s;dom,</HI> and <HI>Plenty,</HI> each of whom appeared in per&s;on with the u&s;ual attributes. The la&s;t, &s;ays he, was very properly per&s;onated by a large fat woman big with child. As to the two former, I hope for the &s;ake of the good people of Frankfort, that they are better repre&s;ented in the town council, than they were on the &s;tage. The prologue was con|cluded by a long harangue pronounced by the plump|e&s;t Apollo, I dare venture to &s;ay, that ever appeared "in the heavens above, or in the earth beneath."</P>
<P>The play was a German tran&s;lation of the Engli&s;h play of George Barnwell, with con&s;iderable alterati|ons. Barnwell is repre&s;ented as an imprudent young man, but does not murder his uncle as in the Eng|li&s;h play, or commit any gro&s;s crime. The tran&s;la|tor, therefore, in&s;tead of hanging, only marries him at the end of the piece.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="318">Mo&s;t of the plays repre&s;ented on the German &s;tage, are tran&s;lations from the Engli&s;h or French for Ger|many, &s;o fertile in writers of divinity, juri&s;prudence, medicine, chemi&s;try, and other parts of natural phi|lophy, has produced few poets till of late; but
<Q>"Now a new progeny from heaven de&s;cend,"</Q>
and the German mu&s;ic is admired all over Europe. Her beauties are felt and applauded by men of genius, and even through the medium of a tran&s;lation, which is a &s;trong proof of her original energy. It is, how|ever, a great di&s;couragement to German poetry in ge|neral, and to the dramatic in particular; but the French language prevails in all the courts, and French plays are repre&s;ented there in preference to German.</P>
<P>The native language of the country is treated like a vulgar and provincial dialect, whil&s;t the French is cultivated as the only proper language for people of fa&s;hion. I have met, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> with per&s;ons who con&s;idered it as an accompli&s;hment to be unable to expre&s;s them&s;elves in the language of their country, and who have pretended to be more ignorant in this particular, than in reality they were.</P>
<P>That the German language is nervous, copious, mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive, and capable of all the graces of poetry,
<PB N="296" REF="319">
appears by the works of &s;everal late writers, who have endeavoured to check this unnatural prejudice in their countrymen, and to re&s;tore the language of their ance&s;tors to its native honours.</P>
<P>Among the winter amu&s;ements of this place, train|eau parties may be reckoned. The&s;e can take place in the time of fro&s;t only, and when there is a con&s;i|derable quantity of &s;now upon the ground. I have given a repre&s;entation of the&s;e traineaus, when &s;peak|ing of Vienna. (See the plate, page 296). There is a little difference at Frankfort, the traineau is there drawn by two hor&s;es in&s;tead of one, and &s;ometimes conducted by a po&s;tilion. And in the Frankfort traineau, a pole is fixed up on one &s;ide of it, to which an en&s;ign or flag is fa&s;tened, which waves over the heads of tho&s;e, placed on the machine, and the hor&s;es have little bells hanging to the trappings.</P>
<P>Whole proce&s;&s;ions of &s;uch traineaus parade the &s;treets of Frankfort at night; the hor&s;es go a bri&s;k trot, or canter; the bells, en&s;igns, and torches make a gay, &s;hewy appearance, and the motion in them is ea&s;y and agreeable.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of the Circle of the Lower Rhine.</HEAD>
<P>THIS circle is &s;ometimes called the Electoral Rhe|ni&s;h Circle; and &s;ometimes the Circle of the four Electors on the Rhine; it terminates on that of We&s;tphalia, Franconia, Suabia, and Burgundy, as al&s;o on Loraine and Al&s;ace, dividing the circle of the Upper Rhine. Its real extent is &s;carce to be deter|mined, but in conjunction with the Upper Rhine, it amounts to 960 &s;quare German miles.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;tates of this circle are the Electors of Mentz, Treves, and Cologne, with the Elector Pala|tine, the Duke of Aremburg, the Prince of Taxis, the Teutonic bailiwick of Coblentz, the Prince of Na&s;&s;au Dietz, on account of the &s;eignory of Beil&s;tein and the Count of Sinzendorf, as burgrave of Rheineck. The &s;ummoning prince is the Elector of Mentz. The religion is mixed.</P>

<HEAD>THE ELECTORATE OF MENTZ.</HEAD>
<P>The Electorates of Mentz, Treves, and Cologne, are eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tates and archbi&s;hopricks. In the elec|toral counties of Mentz, which are in this circle, there are forty-one cities, and twenty-one boroughs. In the proper archbi&s;hopric there are no proprietary nobles, but the nobility there belong to the body of the im|mediate
<PB N="298" REF="321">
knighthood of the empire. In it are al&s;o no provincial &s;tates, except on the Eichsfelde.</P>
<P>The electorate affords &s;ufficient &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the inhabitants; exclu&s;ive of corn, are al&s;o fine garden-fruits and breeds of cattle, with an abundance of ex|cellent wines, particularly the Rheni&s;h wines that grow in the Rheingau. Here and there too are iron-mines. This &s;tate is watered with the Rhine, the Mayne, and two other rivers. In the archbi&s;hopric are &s;ome woollen and other manufactures; at Hoch&s;t, an ingenious porcelain, and on Eichsfelde, they cultivate tobacco and flax.</P>
<P>The electorate is in&s;eparably connected with the archbi&s;hopric, and the archbi&s;hop is cho&s;en by a free choice of the chapter, which con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-four per&s;ons, viz. five prelates, and nineteen capitulars. The former wear a mitre, the re&s;t are generally prie&s;ts, but need not be &s;o. When the archbi&s;hop is cho&s;en, he mu&s;t have the papal confirmation, and this is expen|&s;ive, and he is obliged to pay the Pope 10,000 florins annually, and is &s;ubject to him; he is, however, the fir&s;t archbi&s;hop of Germany&punc; and fir&s;t of the elec|tors. His title is N. N. by the grace of God, of the holy &s;ee of Mentz, archbi&s;hop of the Roman em|pire throughout all Germany, archchancellor and elector, &amp;c. The arms are a wheel <HI>argent</HI> in a field of <HI>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">les,</HI> with the addition of the family-arms.

of Mentz appears not only every where as the fir&s;t &s;tate of the empire, and next after the King of the Romans, but he al&s;o regulates all con&s;ultations rela|tive thereto. The bi&s;hopricks &s;ubject to Mentz, are Worms, Spire, Stra&s;burg, Con&s;tance, Au&s;burg, Chur, Wurzburg, Eich&s;tadt, Padderborn, Hilde&s;heim, and the abbey of Fulda; the electoral revenues are e&s;timated at about 1,200,000 florins (a florin fourteen-pence Engli&s;h). The military con&s;i&s;ts of a life-guard of hor&s;e, a number of dragoons, three regiments of foot, and three provincial regiments.</P>
<P>Mentz is the capital of the electorate, lying on the Rhine, and not far from the Mayne; it is reckoned a barrier fortre&s;s of the empire, and the Circle of the Upper Rhine con&s;iders it as one of its fortre&s;&s;es, therefore keeps it under certain re&s;trictions. The city it&s;elf is very large and populous, but con&s;i&s;ts, for the mo&s;t part, of narrow &s;treets and old fa&s;hioned burghers hou&s;es; though, in &s;ome few places, we &s;ee &s;ome fine buildings and a con&s;iderable palace. The electoral palace of Martin&s;burg, which, in 1750, re|ceived the addition of a beautiful new wing, together with the well built Favorita of the Elector, have fine gardens belonging to them. It has a cathedral, &s;even pari&s;h-churches, a benedictine prelature, a Je&s;uits college, &s;ix mona&s;teries, five nunneries, &s;ix ho&s;pitals, and a univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the town con&s;i&s;ts of a heap of
<PB N="300" REF="323">
black hou&s;es, many of which threaten to fall into the narrow &s;treets; but the northern part of the city is full of very regular buildings; here are three &s;treets, called the <HI>Blerchen,</HI> a mile and a half long, which run parallel to each other from the banks of the Rhine, and are cut almo&s;t regularly by very pretty cro&s;s &s;treets. The archbi&s;hop's palace has a com|manding view of the&s;e &s;treets, the Rhine and the Rhinegau. The bea&s;t-market is well worth &s;eeing, and the market in the middle of the town is one of the fine&s;t places in Germany.</P>
<P>The cathedral is an immen&s;e large, old Gothic building, the &s;pire of which, being wood, was &s;truck with lightning &s;ome years ago, and burnt fourteen hou&s;es before it was con&s;umed; it is now re-built with &s;tone, and co&s;t 4000l. &s;terling; but this grand edifice is &s;o choaked up with &s;hops and hou&s;es, as &s;carce to be vi&s;ible; the &s;carcity of ground in the city occa&s;ions this, a &s;hop and &s;ingle room to live in, letting for 15l. Engli&s;h <HI>per annum;</HI> there is &s;carce ano|ther church in Germany of the height and length of this cathedral. The in&s;ide is decorated with &s;everal magnificent monuments of princes and other great per&s;onages; in it is a trea&s;ury, &s;hewn for a ducat or two, con&s;i&s;ting of jewels, rich ve&s;tments, and other church-furniture. The other churches are modern. In another century the externals of the city will be quite changed; for new &s;treets are forming, and the hou&s;es rebuilding.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="324">Before the Rhine reaches Mentz it is joined by the Mayne, and the waters of the&s;e rivers continue un|mixed a con&s;iderable way from the place of their con|flux, nearly the di&s;tance of four miles. A bridge of boats cro&s;&s;es the Rhine at Mentz, 766 paces long, Roman hi&s;torians make very early mention of this city; &s;ome will have the Eichel&s;tein, or acorn-&s;tone, &s;o called from its figure, to be the tomb of <HI>Claudius Dru&s;us Germanicus,</HI> but the opinion is founded on a weak foundation, it &s;tands within the citadel, on St. Jacob&s;berg.</P>
<P>The inhabitants, who together with the garri&s;on, amount to 30,000, are a good kind of people, who, like all the catholics of Germany, pride them&s;elves in a good table; their faces are intere&s;ting, and they are not deficient either in wit or activity. There is no ca|tholic &s;tate which contains &s;o many learned and deep-thinking men as this does, or &s;o rich and numerous a nobility; there are &s;ome hou&s;es here with e&s;tates of 10,000l. a-year, &s;ixteen or eighteen hou&s;es have from 1500l. a-year to 3000l. The nobility of this place are &s;ome of the olde&s;t and mo&s;t untainted in Germany. After the Pope, there is no doubt but the Archbi&s;hop of Mentz is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and riche&s;t prelate in the chri&s;tian world. The provinces the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable in the whole papal dominions, all Swabia, Franconia, Bohemia, and almo&s;t all Saxony, with a part of Friezland, Bavaria and the Upper Rhine, be|long

to this dioce&s;e, and the temporalities annexed to it add greatly to its &s;plendor. Though the Elector of Mentz does not ab&s;olutely po&s;&s;e&s;s the large&s;t, yet he certainly has the riche&s;t and mo&s;t populous domain of any eccle&s;ia&s;tical potentate in Germany. The country does not contain more than 125 German &s;quare miles, whereas Salt&s;burg contains 240, but then Salt&s;burg has only 250,000 inhabitants, whereas Mentz has 320,000, Salt&s;burg has but ten cities, Mentz has forty. The clergy in this place are the riche&s;t in Germany, a canonry brings in 3500 Rhe|ni&s;h guilders in a moderate year (362l.) the provo&s;t|&s;hip is upwards of 4000l. a-year, the riche&s;t in Ger|many; the income of the chapter amounts to upwards of 30,000l. a year. Many of the canons have three or four prebends, &s;o that there is &s;carce a man among them who has le&s;s than 8 or 900l. a year. The late provo&s;t, a count of Elts, had prebends enough to procure him an income of near 8000l. To give my read|ers an idea of the riches of the mona&s;teries of this place, I need only mention that at the de&s;truction of the Je|&s;uits, their cellars of wine which &s;old cheap, produced 120,000 rix-dollars, each rix-dollar, 3s. 6d. A little while &s;ince the Elector aboli&s;hed a Carthu&s;ian convent and two nunneries, in the holy cellars of which there was found wine, to the value of at lea&s;t 500,000 rix-dollars.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this great wealth, there is not a more regular clergy in all Germany than in this place.
<PB N="303" REF="326">
The nobility here refu&s;e the burgeois admittance among them; &s;peak a mi&s;erable French jargon, and are a&s;hamed of their mother-tongue, of cour&s;e know nothing of the literature of their own country; and their tables, dre&s;&s;es, and equipage, are all in the high Pari&s;ian ton.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants are &s;trongly built, and are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the people of Bavaria and the re&s;t of Germany, by their ruddy fre&s;h complexions: the for|mer have very &s;allow complexions; but though the pea&s;ants are &s;trong, they are not well limbed, owing to the ab&s;urd cu&s;tom of &s;waddling their infants; their knees are either all bent in like a taylor's, or &s;tand out &s;traight like a &s;tick. Black and brown hair is much more common than white, the characteri&s;tic of the Germans in the time of <HI>Tacitus.</HI></P>
<P>There is a great deal of wine made in the countries &s;outh and we&s;t of the Rhine, but the true Rheni&s;h, which &s;ells here for 3s. 6d. a bottle, comes only from the Rhinegau, which lies on the northern banks of the Rhine. <HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> tells us he went to the Rheingau on a party of plea&s;ure, and was pre&s;ent at one of the prettie&s;t village fe&s;tivities he ever beheld. It was that of a gentleman celebrating the fir&s;t ripe bunch of grapes his vineyard produced, a cu&s;tom religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved by all the rich inhabitants of this country. On a &s;udden the doors of his &s;aloon were opened, and there came forth before it in fe&s;tive order, a band of
<PB N="304" REF="327">
mu&s;ic followed by two pretty girls, well dre&s;&s;ed, who brought in a large bunch of grapes on a table, cover|ed with a fine cloth; the &s;ides of the table were orna|mented with flowers. They put the bunch of grapes into the middle, on a kind of throne that was rai&s;ed on the table; this being done, the proprie|tor of the vineyard made an excellent &s;peech, &s;uited to the nature of the fe&s;tivity, and then they danced round the grapes. Can there be a more &s;acred, or more re&s;pectable holiday than that, in which we joy|fully thank the Creator for the benefits he has be&s;towed upon us?</P>
<P>The country between Frankfort and Mentz is very rich, and the road the be&s;t and hand&s;ome&s;t in Ger|many. 'Till within three miles of Frankfort, it is in a &s;traight line rai&s;ed, paved, and guarded on both &s;ides with high &s;tones, which &s;ecure the foot pa&s;&s;engers from waggons and hor&s;es. All the roads through the domain of the city of Frankfort are built in the &s;ame magnificent &s;tyle, and every three miles co&s;ts the city 6000l. Engli&s;h. The <HI>Chau&s;&s;e&eacute;</HI> in the twenty-one miles belonging to Mentz is not rai&s;ed in &s;o expen&s;ive a &s;tyle, but it is broader, planted with trees on both &s;ides and well kept. Seventy-two thou&s;and hor&s;es pa&s;s this road annually, be&s;ides private ones, and bring in to the city of Mentz more than 300l. a year. There pa&s;&s;es likewi&s;e between the two cities on the Rhine, two large ve&s;&s;els con&s;tantly loaded with men and merchandize, and al&s;o a number of waggons on the road, that look

like large hou&s;es, and drawn by &s;ixteen or eighteen hor&s;es each, and carrying from 140 to 150 cwt.</P>
<P>In the approach to Mentz, the city pre&s;ents it&s;elf to your eyes, with a maje&s;ty not to be de&s;cribed. The numberle&s;s brooks which deck its banks, as well as the numerous and magnificent towers of its churches, are reflected by the clear &s;tream of the river. In a word, Dre&s;den, magnificent as it is, is &s;carce to be compared with Mentz.</P>
<P>In the territory of Mentz, behind Cronberg is a mountain called <HI>Altkoniger,</HI> or the Old King, which rai&s;es its head above the ridge of hills that protects the fine plain along the &s;ide of the Mayne, between Frankfort and Mentz, from the rude north winds. <HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> a&s;cended this mountain for the &s;ake of viewing the ri&s;ing &s;un; to the &s;outh it overlooks a plain thirty-three miles broad, terminated by the mountains Spe&s;|&s;art, and Odenwalde, the fore&s;t of Spe&s;&s;art adjoining has a road through it &s;ixteen miles long, but very &s;afe travelling, being guarded by Hu&s;&s;ars. In this plain you &s;ee all the villages, hamlets, and towns, be|tween Frankfort and the Mayne; the ea&s;tern view is clo&s;ed by the Spe&s;&s;art, fifty-one miles di&s;tant. All the country along the Mayne and Neckar, lies like a map under the feet. In order to enjoy the &s;ight of the ri&s;ing &s;un from this mountain, Baron <HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> wrapt him&s;elf in furs, though in a warm Augu&s;t, and made a
<PB N="306" REF="330">
fire of wood in the night, but the break of day fully overpaid the toils of the night. Never did I feel, &s;ays he, my own exi&s;tence, or that of the Being that ani|mates all nature more fully than at the in&s;tant in which the fir&s;t ray of the moon gilded the tops of the Spe&s;&s;art and Odenwalde, both which at a di&s;tance ap|peared to be i&s;lands of fire. As far as this hill, all was thick darkne&s;s, but this ea&s;tern view appeared like an illuminated i&s;land &s;wimming in the black ocean of night. The morning, &s;preading wider and wider, &s;hewed us the mo&s;t beautiful land&s;cape in miniature that we had ever &s;een; we beheld villages afar off in the &s;hade, which one ray of the morning &s;un broke through and di&s;pelled the darkne&s;s of. By degrees we &s;aw the &s;eparation of the hills with their &s;everal tracks and windings; every thing appeared as a fine and well illumined land&s;cape through a per&s;pective gla&s;s. A &s;en&s;ation never before experienced took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me: in beholding the &s;cene, I felt as if expanded, and as if a weight was taken off my heart, and I breathed a pure air. But the fir&s;t break of the &s;un &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the beauties of the dawn; the gran|deur, variety and magnificence of this appearance is above de&s;cription. The plain &s;eventy-five miles long and forty-two broad, which lies between the Spe&s;&s;art, the Donner&s;berg, and the ea&s;tern part of the Oden|walde, and our hills were over&s;pread with large &s;treaks of light contra&s;ted in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, with the thickne&s;s of the &s;hade. The top of the Donner&s;berg
<PB N="307" REF="331">
was gilded over, whil&s;t deep darkne&s;s brooded at his feet, and over all the Rhine beneath. We were our|&s;elves in light, but the plains and villages below were in a kind of half darkne&s;s, broken only by the reflec|tion of the light from the hills on which we &s;tood; the elevated parts of the immen&s;e plains which lay be|fore us, broke through that darkne&s;s, with a cheerful|ne&s;s which brought them much nearer to our view, and produced the mo&s;t agreeable deception. Now, a &s;pire emerged from the gloom, next the &s;ummit of a hill covered with wood, and then a whole village with its trees &s;eemed to &s;wim upon the earth; here lay a corn field in &s;ight, as it were, and rai&s;ed up from the country round it. The river Mayne, which hitherto appeared like a dark &s;tripe of the pro&s;pect, began al&s;o to be illumined with &s;ilver, and the Rhine in a &s;imi|lar manner was &s;oon brought nearer to our eyes; this was followed with &s;uch a blaze, &s;uch a flood of light &mdash; but I feel I am attempting to de&s;cribe a &s;cene that is inde&s;cribable, and to which I am inadequate. In &s;hort, I have often &s;een, &s;ays our author, the &s;un ri&s;e, but never &s;o magnificently as on the Altkonig. A man may travel through many countries and not meet with &s;o favourable a &s;pot as this, for &s;uch an object.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the great reduction made by the archbi&s;hop of Mentz on his civil li&s;t, it &s;till remains by much too immoderate and expen&s;ive; he has his
<PB N="308" REF="332">
mini&s;ters, his coun&s;ellors of &s;tate, and eighty or ninety privy coun&s;ellors of various denominations. The ex|pence of this e&s;tabli&s;hment is di&s;proportionate to the revenue of the &s;tate, owing to the large number of poor nobility who can only accept of employ|ments of this kind. Ignorance of the true principles of government are the cau&s;es of this evil; the con&s;e|quences are, that a great number of per&s;ons who might be u&s;efully employed, live in idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>The military e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;eems equally di&s;propor|tionate. At the acce&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Elector, though the whole army con&s;i&s;ted only of 2200 men, there were &s;ix generals; the regular e&s;tabli&s;hment paid for, and &s;upported by the country is 8000 men, though only 2000 are kept up. This army con&s;i&s;ts of a Ger|man guard of fifty men, and twenty-five hor&s;es; a &s;qua|dron of Hu&s;&s;ars of 130 men (the mo&s;t u&s;eful of the whole, as they &s;erve as a patrol through the roads, and purge the land of robbers and murderers) a corps of artillery of 104 men, three regiments of infantry of 600 men each, and &s;ome companies belonging to the armies of Franconia and the Upper Palatinate.</P>
<P>Of the fortifications of Mentz, we may &s;ay much the &s;ame as of the army. Were they improved and kept up as they ought to be, they would vie with Luxemburg, and be the mo&s;t powerful of all the bar|riers of France. The beauty and &s;ize of them are
<PB N="309" REF="333">
objects of wonder, but though great &s;ums have been expended in building them, part of them are &s;till un|fini&s;hed, and parts are falling to decay. Their extent would require a great army to garri&s;on them, but this is evidently beyond the power of this court, or indeed, the whole circle of the Upper Rhine united, of cour&s;e are to be looked upon as one of tho&s;e things, which &s;erve more for &s;hew than for u&s;e.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the greater courts of Germany are endea|vouring to &s;implify their &s;everal &s;y&s;tems as much as po&s;&s;ible, and to introduce efficacious economy; the di&s;&s;ipation, pomp and love of out&s;ide &s;how of the le&s;&s;er ones, is beyond all bounds, and pa&s;t all belief. The&s;e courts very much re&s;emble the expen&s;ive pup|pet-&s;hew theatre of Prince E&s;therha&s;i. The orche&s;tra is fine, the &s;cenes beautiful, and machinery delectable, but the actors are only puppets, deficient in what con|&s;titutes true greatne&s;s. This reproach, however, does not &s;o much affect the pre&s;ent Archbi&s;hop, who, as far as circum&s;tances allow him, is, perhaps, the only prelate, who endeavours to render his court more u&s;eful than o&s;tentatious.</P>
<P>Was I to de&s;cribe all the little courts of Germany, and all the capital cities, it would take up many volumes of this work; if I de&s;cribe the principal, I tru&s;t my readers will think it &s;ufficient, there being a &s;imilarity throughout the whole. I &s;hall proceed, therefore, to

<HEAD>THE ELECTORATE OF TREVES.</HEAD>
<P>The country here is rather mountainous and &s;andy, but contains good pa&s;turage and &s;ome cattle-land, yet much corn is imported; the growth of wines here, on the Mo&s;el, is con&s;iderable; there is al&s;o plenty of game, and &s;ome valuable mines. The archbi&s;hopric contains twenty-eight towns, of which Treves is the capital. The nobility of this electorate enjoy almo&s;t a third of its e&s;tates. The electoral &s;ubjects are Ro|man-catholics, but there are &s;ome prote&s;tants &s;ubject to the Elector.</P>
<P>The Archbi&s;hop is cho&s;en by the chapter; he is the &s;econd &s;piritual elector, and his title is&mdash;"By the grace of God, archbi&s;hop of Treves, of the holy Roman em|pire, throughout Gaul and the kingdom of Arles, arch|chancellor and elector. The arms of Trems are a &s;hield quartered, in who&s;e upper dexter field and lower field &s;ini&s;ter, is a cro&s;s of gules in a field argent. The &s;uffragans to this archbi&s;hopric, are Metz, Tull, and Verdun. The chapter con&s;i&s;ts of forty canons, all of

<P>Triers or Treves was a town of note before the chri&s;tian aera; it was the head town of the fir&s;t Belgi|um, the re&s;idence of the ancient Roman emperors, and &s;o early as the days of <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great,</HI> it was the capital of all Gaul. Of the ancient town, there are &s;ome remains, particularly of the Roman theatre; the cathedral church &s;tands on a hill, and is a large building; there are three collegiate churches, and five pari&s;h ones, with three Je&s;uits colleges, thirteen con|vents, and a univer&s;ity. The city is of a &s;quare form, it is &s;eated between two mountains on the Mo&s;el, over which there is a fine &s;tone bridge. The churches, mona&s;teries, and the Elector's palace, are e&s;teemed magnificent buildings, but have &s;uffered in the late wars.</P>
<P>Coblentz is the &s;econd city in this electorate, fifty miles N. E. of Treves, &s;ituated at the confluence of the Rhine and Mo&s;el, wonderfully plea&s;ant, &s;ur|rounded with vineyards, and at the di&s;tance of forty miles from Cologne. It is of a triangular form, hav|ing two of its &s;ides wa&s;hed by the above rivers, and the third enclo&s;ed with a wall and modern fortifica|tions;
<PB N="312" REF="336">
its convenient &s;ituation has rendered it a town of good trade, in corn, wine, wood, and iron; the hou&s;es are well built, and the &s;treets uniform; there is a &s;tone bridge over the Mo&s;el, and a bridge of boats over the Rhine; and on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Rhine, a ca&s;tle, on a hill, commanding the town and the pa&s;&s;age of both rivers, and at the bottom of this hill &s;tands the Elector's palace, the front of which, and the two large wings, look towards the rivers.</P>
<P>Coblentz is a very pretty city, the u&s;ual re&s;idence of the Elector, and yet rather a dead place; it contains about 12,000 inhabitants. The elector is al&s;o bi&s;hop of Au&s;burg, which brings him in near 20,000 guild|ers; he has al&s;o another appointment that brings him in 8000 guilders; the&s;e, with the income of the elec|torate, would almo&s;t make <HI>me</HI> think with <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> "Only make me Pope (&s;aid a Roman patrician to one who wanted to convert him), and I will be a chri&s;tian!"</P>

<HEAD>THE ELECTORATE OF COLOGNE.</HEAD>
<P>The country between Coblentz and Cologne is very fine and very well peopled; there is a beautiful town near the latter, viz. Newvied, quite a new town, re|gularly built, and full of indu&s;try. The inhabi|tants enjoy not only a perfect freedom of religion,
<PB N="313" REF="337">
but an exemption from taxes. It is a colony of Mo|ravians; but Bonn is the large&s;t and hand&s;ome&s;t town between Coblentz and Cologne; it is the re&s;idence of the Elector of Cologne, and contains 12,000 inha|bitants.</P>
<P>The territories belonging to the archbi&s;hopric lie not all together, but are many of them &s;eparated from each other by foreign territories; the chief part of it lies along the Rhine, and is above eighty miles in length, but very narrow. The&s;e countries are of a very different nature; one mountainous and woody, another &s;andy, and a third very fruitful.</P>
<P>This electorate has fifty-two towns, and &s;eventeen boroughs; the land-diets are held at Bonn. Roman-catholics only enjoy the public exerci&s;e of their reli|ligion, but it has al&s;o many prote&s;tants. The Elec|tor's title is, "By the grace of God, &amp;c. archbi&s;hop of Cologne, and archchancellor of the holy Roman empire throughout all Italy; al&s;o elector and <HI>legatus natus</HI> of the holy apo&s;tolic &s;ee, Duke of Engern and We&s;tphalia, &amp;c." The arms of Cologne are a cro&s;s &s;able in a field argent. The electoral revenues are but &s;mall; the military e&s;tabli&s;hment is a life-guard of halbardiers and yeomen, and a regiment of foot|guards.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="338">Near Rentz, on the Rhine, in this electorate, is to be &s;een the <HI>Konig&s;tuhl,</HI> or <HI>Thronus regelis,</HI> a remark|able piece of antiquity, con&s;i&s;ting of a round vault, built of free-&s;tone, and re&s;ting upon nine &s;tone pillars, one of which &s;tands in the middle. This vault is eight German ells and a quarter high (each German ell half an Engli&s;h one) forty and half a quarter in compa&s;s, and twelve and a quarter in dia|meter, being furni&s;hed above with &s;even &s;eats, agree|able to the number of electors at that time; the a&s;cent to it is by &s;tairs of &s;tone, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eventy-eight &s;teps, and it has two &s;tone doors. On this regal chair the electors formerly held con&s;ultations for &s;ome time, concerning the election of the king and emperor, previous to the election day at Frankfort, and whenever any thing prevented the election at that place, it was held here. The emperor, Henry VII. was here elected in 1308; here al&s;o was e&s;tabli&s;hed the electoral league in 1338; but it has not been u&s;ed &s;ince the election of <HI>Maximilian</HI> I.</P>
<P>Cologne, an Imperial city, in the circle of We&s;tpha|lia, is neverthele&s;s the capital of the electorate, and of cour&s;e mentioned here, it lies on the Rhine in the form of a &s;emicircle, and is one of the olde&s;t and large&s;t cities, but at the &s;ame time, the uglie&s;t in all Germany; not a &s;ingle building worth &s;eeing within its walls, which are nine miles in circumference; mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are falling to the ground, and a
<PB N="315" REF="339">
great part of them &s;tands quite empty; and as to the population, we cannot give a better idea of it than by &s;aying, that every large hou&s;e, with a court, &s;tables, and a large garden, in one of the be&s;t &s;treets in the city will not let for more than about 5l. 10s. a year Engli&s;h. Round the walls which enclo&s;e the whole domain of the &s;tate, there are &s;ome hundred farm hou&s;es, which produce all the vegetables, with as much butter, chee&s;e, and milk, as is u&s;ed in the city. In many &s;treets there is dung laying before the hou&s;es on each &s;ide; many are &s;o empty that you may walk in them for an hour and not &s;ee a &s;ingle per&s;on. The great &s;quare or place would, however, from its &s;ize and the beautiful rows of lime-trees in it, be one of the mo&s;t magnificent in the world, if it was not darkened by the half-fallen buildings about it.</P>
<P>The city was built before the time of the Romans; it is a free Imperial one, and maintains four compa|nies of &s;oldiers. In time of war it is garri&s;oned. Though the fortifications &s;eem to have but little &s;trength, they are of va&s;t extent, inclo&s;ing a great deal of ground that is not built on, and many gardens and vineyards of more than 300 acres. It has twenty-four gates, a va&s;t number of public buildings, twenty-&s;even churches, thirty chapels, twelve mona&s;teries, twenty-two nunneries, and four large ho&s;pitals. The public edifices indeed are &s;o numerous, in proportion to the city, that mo&s;t of it is taken up with them; the
<PB N="316" REF="340">
&s;treets are large and well paved, but there are only two &s;quares or market-places. The cathedral is a large building, would be very magnificent if it were fini&s;hed, but that is not the ca&s;e, though it was begun in 1254. In this cathedral they &s;hew three &s;kulls, richly en&s;hrined, which according to tradition, be|longed to the wi&s;e men that came from the Ea&s;t to wor&s;hip our Saviour, fir&s;t brought to Con&s;tantinople by the mother of <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great,</HI> from thence moved to Milan, and in 1164, removed to Cologne. In the church of <HI>St. Gereon,</HI> they expo&s;e to view the heads of 1000 &s;aints, who are &s;aid to have &s;uffered martyrdom under the emperor <HI>Maximilian.</HI> The fore&s;t of &s;hips in the port, and the numerous church-&s;teeples give Cologne at a di&s;tance, a very magnifi|cent appearance, but it all vani&s;hes on entering the city. The &s;treets and inhabitants, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> are alike dark and ugly; I came by water, and I had &s;carce made my entry, when I met with an event which gave me no very high idea of the police of the place. On my landing from the ve&s;&s;el, they &s;ent a &s;oldier with me to the inn, to &s;earch my baggage; but we were no &s;ooner alone, than he told me how old he was, what a trouble it would be for him to go to the inn, and provided I would give him a few pence, I might go where I plea&s;ed; but I had hardly got rid of him, when a heap of beggars a&s;&s;ailed me and followed me quite to the inn. Indeed a third part of the inha|bitants are privileged beggars, who form here a re|gular

corporation; they &s;it upon rows of &s;tools in every church, and take precedence according to &s;e|niority. When the olde&s;t dies, his next neighbour takes his place; the old people who belong to the fra|ternity, con&s;ider a place upon the&s;e &s;tools as a provi|&s;ion for a &s;on, or a marriage portion for a daughter. Many of them have &s;tools belonging to them in &s;eve|ral churches, which they vi&s;it alternately on the days of the mo&s;t brilliant fe&s;tivities, and divide among their heirs when they die. On the few days of the year on which there are no fe&s;tivities, they di&s;per&s;e about the city and mole&s;t the pa&s;&s;engers, with an in|&s;olence and rudene&s;s not to be conceived. Here it was king <HI>Charles</HI> II. of England &s;pent the la&s;t two years of his exile.</P>
<P>When I came to the inn, continues the Baron, the ho&s;te&s;s was bargaining with a dirty Monk to &s;ay a ma&s;s for her, he a&s;ked fourteen &s;tivers (that is four|teen pence) and &s;he would give him only twelve. At la&s;t when they had &s;truck their bargain, and the prie&s;t was gone, there came another who had overheard all that pa&s;&s;ed, and offered her, if &s;he would be off, to &s;ay ma&s;s for ten &s;tivers. One third of the inhabitants I have ob&s;erved are beggars, another third are eccle|&s;ia&s;tics; for be&s;ides the numerous convents, the place is crowded with a motley race of men, which are cal|led abb&eacute;s, not &s;uch powdered, &s;mirking, eccle&s;ia&s;tic beaux as are &s;een at Paris, who make parties with the
<PB N="318" REF="342">
ladies and attend at their levees; but rough and dirty clowns, be&s;meared all over with tobacco, who play for pence with the pea&s;ants in public ale-hou&s;es, or after having &s;aid ma&s;s in the morning, run of errands, clean &s;hoes, or are porters for the re&s;t of the day. I have never &s;een the church, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> in &s;o con|temptible a &s;tate as it is here. There are &s;everal eccle&s;i|a&s;tics, who do not them&s;elves know what they are. I was acquainted with a canon who made 2000 guilders annually of his &s;tall, but who told me him&s;elf that he neither &s;aid ma&s;s, or &s;aw his church for twelve months together. I met another of them in a coffee-hou&s;e kept by a young woman whom he loved, but who was likewi&s;e courted by a merchant's clerk. The ri|vals having engaged in a game of billiards, from words proceeded to blows, until the prebendary was fair|ly laid under the table. When I had, with &s;ome difficulty, made peace, the clerk went his way, and another extraordinary &s;cene followed. The canon had a pretty young man with him, whom he had lodged and boarded for &s;ome time; he took it &s;o ill that this toad-eater had not taken his part, that after reproaching him with the favours he had conferred upon him, he renounced his friend&s;hip before the whole company. The part of the French abb&eacute;s is played here by the&s;e regular canons, the Antonites and the prie&s;ts of the order of Malta; you &s;ee them about the ladies in all great hou&s;es. As to the nuns, <HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, there were four big with child
<PB N="319" REF="343">
when he was there, and &s;ix were immured for not having under&s;tood the art of not being with child. In the fir&s;t days of my abode here, the &s;on of a gentle|man to whom I was recommended, took me with him to a nunnery to &s;ee his &s;i&s;ter, we found her with another friend in a &s;ick room where they are allowed to receive vi&s;its. In the fir&s;t quarter of an hour of the vi&s;it, I di&s;covered that my friend was not come to &s;ee his &s;i&s;ter, and that her friend's di&s;order was not very dangerous. I found the &s;i&s;ter agreeable enough, not to be tired of her, whil&s;t the brother was entertained by the friend. The next week the &s;i&s;ter was ill and the friend attended her to the ho&s;pital; &s;he gratefully returned the favour the week after, and I &s;oon found that, let me &s;tay here as long as I plea&s;ed, we &s;hould have vi&s;its to make every week, till the whole circle of di&s;ea&s;es had been gone through by the&s;e nuns.</P>
<P>Want of proper government is the cau&s;e of the unlimited freedom which is enjoyed by the eccle&s;ia|&s;tics of this place, they live in the greate&s;t anarchy; for though they are properly &s;ubject to the Archbi&s;hop of Cologne, the magi&s;tracy of the place is jealous of the Archbi&s;hop's power, and will &s;uffer none of his orders relating to di&s;cipline to be carried into execution; thus between the two powers, poor di&s;cipline falls to the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="344">The la&s;t third of the people con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ome patri|cian families and of merchants and mechanics, on whom the other two parts live. On the whole, Cologne is at lea&s;t a century behind the re&s;t of Ger|many, Bavaria it&s;elf not excepted. Bigotry, ill manners, clowni&s;hne&s;s, &s;lothfulne&s;s are vi&s;ible every where, and the &s;peech, dre&s;s, and furniture of the hou&s;es, every thing, in &s;hort, is &s;o different from what is &s;een in the re&s;t of Germany, that you conceive your&s;elf in the mid&s;t of a colony of &s;trangers. There are certainly &s;ome exceptions where ma&s;ters of families are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for their ta&s;te and elegant manner of living, but the&s;e exceptions are very few.</P>
<P>It is owing to the government of the country that this city is &s;o far behind the other &s;tates of Germany. Together with the hatred of innovation common to all republics, and the u&s;ual impatience and weakne&s;s of the magi&s;trates, the ab&s;urd corporation-&s;y&s;tem pre|vails here with more force than in any other of the free Imperial cities. One in&s;tance will &s;hew how im|po&s;&s;ible it is for this town ever to go on improving, as the re&s;t of Germany has done. A few years &s;ince &s;ettled here, a baker from the Palatinate, who from the cir|cum&s;tance of the other bakers, baking &s;uch bread as only an inhabitant of Cologne could eat, &s;oon carried on a thriving trade. Jealou&s;y at his good fortune, &s;oon brought his brethren of the company to his hou&s;e, who pulled down his oven. The affair was
<PB N="321" REF="345">
brought before a court of ju&s;tice; on the day it was to be determined, not only the company of bakers, but the other companies of barbers, &s;hoemakers, &amp;c. a&s;&s;em|bled round the court-hou&s;e and &s;wore they would put an end to the magi&s;trates and magi&s;tracy together, if they licen&s;ed any man to bake better bread than the other gentlemen of the corps. The magi&s;tracy knew its men, who, on a former occa&s;ion had hu&s;tled &s;ome of them in the church-yard, and admoni&s;hed by the precedent, they made this &s;pirited decree. "That whereas the audacious baker had taken upon him to bake bread, &s;uch as the re&s;t of the corporation did not bake, he &s;hould build up his oven again at his own expence, and for the future be cautious and only bake &s;uch bread as the town has been u&s;ed to feed upon."</P>
<P>The ob&s;tinacy with which the &s;everal corporations of the place defend their privileges, the rudene&s;s of the common people, which &s;ome think proper to dig|nify with the name of liberty, and the immoderate and unre&s;trained licentiou&s;ne&s;s which univer&s;ally obtains, render Cologne very de&s;erving of the name of Little London, and indeed by which name &s;ome of its in|habitants love to di&s;tingui&s;h it. Like the Great Lon|don, it is remarkable for the pride of the common people and the in&s;olence with which they treat &s;tran|gers. Having behaved rather impertinently to their neighbours, the elector of Cologne, and the elector

Palatine; an attempt was made to reform them in the mo&s;t effectual way, by cutting off their provi&s;ions. The magi&s;tracy immediately di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers to the Emperor to acquaint him that they were upon the point of being &s;tarved to death, and in the mean time the burghers rubbed up their old &s;words, and a&s;&s;em|bling in crowds in the ale-hou&s;es and other public places of the city, denounced death and vengeance on the Elector. The Emperor out of pity had the in|terdict taken off, and ever &s;ince the populace have exclaimed, "we have brought the Elector to rea&s;on, he was appri&s;ed of our intended march, and has act|ed very wi&s;ely in not &s;uffering matters to run to ex|tremities!" Preci&s;ely in the &s;tyle of a London mob.</P>
<P>The government of the city con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ix burgo-ma&s;ters, &s;even aldermen, and one hundred and fifty common councilmen, who all continue for life. Two of the burgo-ma&s;ters are regents by turns; the alder|men are appointed by the archbi&s;hop, and the com|mon council elected by the trading companies of the city. A governing burgo-ma&s;ter of Cologne holds nearly the &s;ame &s;tate as the Lord Mayor of London. He wears a Roman toga, half black, half purple, a large Spani&s;h hat, Spani&s;h breeches, and wai&s;tcoat, &amp;c. he has al&s;o his <HI>lictors,</HI> who carry the <HI>fa&s;ces</HI> before him when he appears in his public character. In the la&s;t war, a French regiment de&s;ired to march through the city, but it was oppo&s;ed, on the pretence that the
<PB N="323" REF="347">
king of Pru&s;&s;ia was their liege lord, as duke of Cleves and count of the Mark, and they told the colonel, who de&s;ired to have the gates opened to him, that they were determined to ob&s;erve a &s;trict neutrality. It was in vain for him to remon&s;trate that he was conducting auxiliary troops to the &s;ervice of the Emperor, their &s;overeign lord. The gates were kept &s;hut, and no|thing le&s;s than the plea&s;ure of having their hou&s;es burnt about their ears, would content the mob of the place. However, when the cannon were planted and ready to fire, the council thought better of it, and to the great mortification of the populace determined to permit the pa&s;&s;age. The commanding officer, as &s;oon as he had got in, made the be&s;t of his way immedia|tely to the hall to remon&s;trate with the mayor, whom he found with all the <HI>in&s;ignia</HI> of maje&s;ty on his throne, encompa&s;&s;ed with his lictors. As the&s;e however did not prevent a few remarks being made, the magi&s;|trate immediately drew up, and ordering the lictors to rai&s;e the <HI>fa&s;ces,</HI> a&s;ked the colonel "whether he had a proper conception of the dignity of a Roman burgo-ma&s;ter, or whether he knew that he repre&s;ented the maje&s;ty of the Roman Cae&s;ars, and had opened the gates to him merely out of good will." The officer who had drawn up his troops with their bayonets fixed, and firelocks primed, in the great &s;quare, and was in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city, could not ab&s;tain from laughing, but as he had already the door in his hand,
<PB N="324" REF="348">
the only an&s;wer he made was, "you are not quite right in your head."</P>
<P>The want of all police, a want which in this town con&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ence of liberty, brings here from the Upper Rhine, We&s;tphalia, the Imperial Netherlands, France, and Holland, va&s;t numbers of people who choo&s;e to live incognito. There are very good &s;ocieties to be met with, made up of the better &s;ort of the&s;e adven|turers, numerous Pru&s;&s;ian and Imperial officers, the canons of the place, &s;ome patrician and prote&s;tant merchants. For though the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the place is Roman-catholic, yet the principal mer|chants and trade&s;men are prote&s;tants, of whom the Lutherans have a church in the city, but the Calvi|ni&s;ts are obliged to go &s;ix miles on the other &s;ide the Rhine, to Mulheim to wor&s;hip. The bri&s;k naviga|tion, particularly of the Dutch, for which this town is the &s;taple, and which they dare not pa&s;s by; the low price of all the nece&s;&s;aries of life; the neighbourhood of Bonn, the total ab&s;ence of the in&s;upportable court airs, and in&s;olence of the noble&s;&s;e, which is met with in almo&s;t every other city, the whole&s;omene&s;s of the air, and the cheerfulne&s;s of the inhabitants of the neighbouring electorate and duchy of Berg, renders, this is a very agreeable abode to tho&s;e who wi&s;h to mix &s;omewhat of the country with the city life, not|with&s;tanding the di&s;agreeable manners of the majo|rity.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="349">The&s;e moro&s;e and heavy people are equally di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the re&s;t of Europe, for their religious, as well as for their political &s;uper&s;titions.

<P>The &s;uper&s;tition of this Little London &s;urpa&s;&s;es every thing we can imagine. They are not contented here with &s;ingle &s;aints, but mu&s;t have whole armies of them. In the church of St. <HI>Ur&s;ula,</HI> is &s;hewn the tomb of that &s;aint, who, if their records may be credited, came over from Britain, with 1100 virgins, to con|vert the infidels of this country, and who all &s;uffered martyrdom under the Huns; and although a collec|tion of 11,000 Briti&s;h virgins in the days of the hep|tarchy, may appear an impo&s;&s;ibility on the face of it, a man who &s;hould attempt here to &s;ubtract a &s;ingle one from the number, would &s;tand a very great chance of being knocked on the head. Wonderful as this &s;tory is in it&s;elf, other wonders are brought in confir|mation of it. Among the re&s;t, there is a monument which has a &s;mall coffin enclo&s;ed in it, and on which the following words are written. "A natural child was buried in this church with the virgins, but inno|cent as he was, they would not &s;uffer him to mix his bones with theirs, but drove him out again, and there
<PB N="326" REF="350">
was a nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>burying</HI> him above ground." It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that there are authors who do not agree with this account; &s;ome &s;cout it wholly, and others think the prince&s;s had a maid of honour called <HI>Undecimilla,</HI> which, by &s;ome blundering monks was changed into 11,000. Here al&s;o lies interred in a church, which bears his name St. <HI>Gereon,</HI> with 1200 or 12,000 (for they do not &s;tand for a cypher here in reckoning up &s;aints) of his &s;oldiers; but what is mo&s;t laughable, is two wooden hor&s;es painted white, which are looking out of a window of an old building in the new &s;quare. The hi&s;tory of this monument is as follows: "A wealthy young woman was formerly buried from this hou&s;e, with very rich ornaments, which the grave-digger having ob&s;erved, he came in the night to rob the corp&s;e; &s;carce was the coffin opened, but the woman &s;tood up, and &s;eizing the lan|thorn, which the a&s;toni&s;hed grave-digger dropped in his fright, walked directly home with it; &s;he knocked at the door, and the maid came to the window, and a&s;ked, Who was there? Your mi&s;tre&s;s, an&s;wered the other. The girl immediately ran with the account to her ma&s;ter, who, perhaps, not being plea&s;ed at the re|turn of his wife from her grave, cried out. It is as impo&s;&s;ible for it to be <HI>my</HI> wife, as for the two hor&s;es to come out of the &s;table, run up into the garret, and look out of the window. No &s;ooner &s;aid than done. The two white nags trotted immediately up &s;tairs, and have remained at the window to this day." The
<PB N="327" REF="351">
poor man had no remedy but to take back his wife, who lived &s;even years with him after this, and wove a great quantity of linen, which, together with a &s;et of paintings, exhibiting the whole &s;tory, is &s;till to be &s;een in the neighbouring church. Unfortunately for the Cologne&s;e, who are in every thing di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of the &s;ons of men, this &s;ame &s;tory is told preci&s;ely with the &s;ame circum&s;tances in two other places of Germany; but the people of Cologne have added the vi&s;ible and perpetual monument of the two hor&s;es.</P>
<P>It is not here as in the other dark parts of Germa|ny, where &s;mall tales only &s;erve for the amu&s;ement of the idler; the Cologne&s;e are in downright earne&s;t, they con&s;ider their country as the &s;pecial habitation of the &s;aints, call it the holy city, and the earth it|&s;elf as holy, and are equally ready to become mar|tyrs for the truth of what they advance, or to make martyrs of any who doubt it.</P>
<P>The prie&s;ts of the place, e&s;pecially the monks, carry no better &s;tories with them into their pulpits, and the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences are, that the manners of this people are more corrupted than in any other place under the &s;un. The churches them&s;elves, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> are made places of rendezvous, where every kind of licentiou&s;ne&s;s is in part agreed upon, and in part carried into effect.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="352">The evening &s;ervices of the monks are like the evening walks in the &s;uburbs of Vienna, and every ale-hou&s;e round the place teems with adultery and fornication.

<P>Formerly Cologne could reckon 30,000 men bear|ing arms, and in the twelfth century, it &s;tood a &s;iege again&s;t the whole empire united.

Indeed, when we con&s;ider her &s;ituation, lying on one of the mo&s;t navigable ri|vers in the world, the &s;hores of which are covered with inhabitants; its &s;taple; the republican form of its go|vernment; the admirable roads which connect it with all Germany, and various other advantages; the greate&s;t wonder of all the wonders of this wonderful city is, how it can po&s;&s;ibly have contrived to have fallen &s;o low; at pre&s;ent, it does not contain more than 25,000 people. Their manufactures are low, &s;ave that of tobacco, a few in&s;ignificant laces, and the pins which are made by the wives and daughters of the poor, all &s;pirit of indu&s;try is effec|tually &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by monkery, and a di&s;&s;olution of manners annexed to it. Tho&s;e who pa&s;s for mer|chants are only brokers and commi&s;&s;ioners for other countries. Excepting a few &s;mall bankers, there is
<PB N="329" REF="353">
&s;carce above ten or twelve hou&s;es that have any thing like a &s;olid commerce; the object of the&s;e are drugs, wine, wrought and unwrought iron from the mines of Na&s;&s;au, wood from the Upper Rhine, Mayne, and Neckar, and a few other le&s;s important articles.</P>
<P>When a &s;tranger objects to the people of Cologne, their intollerance towards the mo&s;t u&s;eful inhabitants of the city, namely, the prote&s;tants; when he com|pares the &s;tupidity, the barbarity, debauchery, and poverty of the citizens of the place, with the know|ledge, indu&s;try, frugality, and riches of the foreign|ers there re&s;iding, they are not the lea&s;t affected with the ju&s;tne&s;s of the remarks, but turn them to their own advantage in the following manner. "The&s;e heretics, &s;ay they, are lo&s;t &s;ouls, their hearts are wrapt up in worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which God vouch|&s;afes them, in order to render their damnation the greater. God has evidently reprobated the rich in his holy writ, and their riches are the faggots, which, in another world will be piled up to burn them." With opinions, like the&s;e, which the monks hold forth from every pulpit, can it be wondered at, if the third part of the inhabitants are beggars?</P>
<P>Nothing di&s;plays the con&s;titution of the German empire, in a better light, than the navigation of the Rhine; every prince, &s;o far as his domain on the
<PB N="330" REF="354">
banks reaches, con&s;iders the &s;hips that pa&s;s as foreign ve&s;&s;els, and loads them, without di&s;tinction, with in|tolerable taxes, determined to get by the navigation, whether they lo&s;e by the export of commodities or not. In the &s;mall di&s;trict between Mentz and Coblentz, which, with the windings of the river, &s;carce makes 27 miles, there are not le&s;s than nine tolls to pay; each of the&s;e produce annually from 25,000 to 30,000 guilders, not to mention a number of articles which pay toll in &s;pecie, and make a part of the pay of the toll-gatherers. The&s;e tolls contribute in a great mea|&s;ure to the ruin of the country, and have been called, by an Engli&s;h writer, an incomprehen&s;ible duty. When the Elector Palatine made it difficult for the city of Mentz to export the corn of his country, the archbi&s;hop endeavoured to revenge him&s;elf by rai&s;ing the toll of the grape of the Palatinates, the tobacco, and the other productions. On the other hand, the Elector Palatine made repri&s;als by his toll on the Lower Rhine, and revenged him&s;elf on the Mentz wines carried into Holland. Every &s;pecies of chi|canery, which ho&s;tile powers can u&s;e towards each other, was made u&s;e of on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent government of the archbi&s;hopric of Cologne, and the bi&s;hopric of Mun&s;ter, which are held by the &s;ame per&s;on, is, without a doubt, the mo&s;t active and mo&s;t enlightened of all the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical governments of Germany. The mini&s;try of
<PB N="331" REF="355">
the court of Bonn, where the archbi&s;hop re&s;ides, is excellently compo&s;ed, and the bi&s;hopric of Mun&s;ter, be&s;ides the effect, which their influence has on it, is happy in the protection of the &s;everal members who compo&s;e the a&s;&s;emblies of its &s;tates. The eccle&s;i|a&s;tics of both the countries are a mo&s;t &s;triking con|tra&s;t to tho&s;e of the city of Cologne, for their great learning and good manners. The cabinet of Bonn is &s;ingularly happy in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;eminaries, the improvement of agriculture and indu&s;try, and the extirpation of every &s;pecies of monkery. The Electorate of Cologne is worth about 100,000l. &s;terl|ing, and the bi&s;hopric of Mun&s;ter about 110,000l.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age on the Rhine from Mentz to Cologne is the mo&s;t delightful of its kind, the hills which hang perpendicularly over the Rhine, are &s;ome of them co|vered with various greens, &s;ome with naked &s;tones, and others with blue and white &s;lates. Their appearance, their &s;lope, the different and various cultures, together with the windings of the river, change the pro&s;pect almo&s;t every moment. There is a village almo&s;t every three miles, and every hill is covered with a ca&s;tle, formerly the habitation of &s;ome German knight. The mo&s;t picture&s;que fancy can paint nothing more romantic, than the &s;ituation of their cities and villages. In the mid&s;t of the Rhine, between the two cities, on a rock, which hardly ri&s;es above the &s;ur|face of the water, &s;tands a high, thick, &s;olid tower,
<PB N="332" REF="356">
called the <HI>Palatine,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to have been originally the &s;eat of the elector, and nothing can be conceived more &s;ingular or &s;triking in a land&s;cape, when viewed at a certain di&s;tance, than the &s;ituation of this tower.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE PALATINATE ON THE RHINE.</HEAD>
<P>The country of the Elector Palatine is al&s;o called the Lower Palatinate, and thereby di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Upper Palatinate, in the circle of Bavaria. To the ea&s;t, it terminates on the county of Katzenelln|bogen, the archbi&s;hopric of Mentz, the bi&s;hopric of Worms, and a part of the territories of the Teuto|nic order in Franconia; to the &s;outh, on the duchy of Wurtemburg and the bi&s;hopric of Spire; to the we&s;t, on Al&s;ace, the duchy of Deuxponts, the coun|ty of Spanheim, the duchy of Simmeren, and certain di&s;tricts belonging to the Elector of Mentz; and to the north, on a part of that archbi&s;hopric and the county of Katzenellnbogen. A &s;traight line drawn from Bacharach to the Neckar, near Neckar&s;ulm, which may be con&s;idered as the greate&s;t extent of the electorate, will mea&s;ure about eighty miles. It con|tains forty-one cities and &s;everal boroughs.</P>
<P>This country is partly mountainous, but very fruit|ful, producing all manner of corn and fine heads of cattle, with plantations of tobacco, and good Neckar and Rheni&s;h wine. The Rhine runs partly through
<PB N="333" REF="357">
the borders of this electorate, and partly through its centre. Out of the &s;ands near Germer&s;heim and Seltz, is wa&s;hed the be&s;t Rheni&s;h gold, which is con&s;idered as a royalty, and farmed by the Elector.</P>
<P>The electoral title is that of Pal&s;grave of the Rhine, arch-trea&s;urer and elector of the holy Roman em|pire, duke in Bavaria, Juliers, Cleve, and the Berg, prince of Mors, marquis of Bergen-op Zoom, count of Veldem, &amp;c. The electoral arms are a lion or, in a field &s;able. There is here an order of knight|hood, that of St. Hubert, a quadrangular cro&s;s pendant to a red ribband, and a &s;tar on the brea&s;t. The Elector maintains two regiments of life-guards of hor&s;e, and another of Swi&s;s, with &s;ome few regiments of hor&s;e and foot. The cities which are part of this electorate, are Manheim and Heidelberg.</P>
<P>Manheim is the &s;econd town in this electorate, and the re&s;idence of the Elector. It is a &s;trong for|tre&s;s lying in a low plain, near the influx of the Neckar into the Rhine, twelve miles N. W. of Hei|delberg. It is generally e&s;teemed as one of the mo&s;t beautiful cities in Germany. The &s;treets are all &s;traight as an arrow, being what they call <HI>tir&eacute;es au cordeau,</HI> and inter&s;ect each other at right angles, &s;o that the &s;pectator has at each corner a view of four &s;treets. This never fails to plea&s;e at fir&s;t, but be|comes &s;ooner tire&s;ome, than a town built with le&s;s re|gularity. When a man has walked through the town
<PB N="334" REF="358">
for half a forenoon, his eyes &s;earch in vain for va|riety; the &s;ame objects &s;eem to move along with him, as if he had been all the while on &s;hip-board.</P>
<P>To the great market here, the Roman-catholic church, and the council-hou&s;e, with the tower &s;tand|ing between them, add an ornamental &s;ymmetry. In this market is a fine fountain with four pillars, in which &s;tands a lion, but &s;till the town &s;o labours under a want of good water and whole&s;ome air, that the people u&s;e the water of Heidelberg. The electo|ral palace is one of the fine&s;t buildings in all Eu|rope, &s;ituated at the junction of the Rhine and Neck|ar. The collection of paintings in this palace and the cabinet of curio&s;ities, is worth attention; here is depo&s;ited the golden crown of the unhappy elector and Bohemian King, who married the daughter of James I. and from whom the pre&s;ent reigning family of Great Britain is de&s;cended. Be&s;ides the church above-mentioned, here is a Calvini&s;tical one, and a Lutheran one, be&s;ides a je&s;uit's college, and a fine church belonging to it; there are al&s;o two other con|vents and a Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue. Manheim contains likewi&s;e &s;ome manufactories, with a con&s;iderable trade, and a fine &s;taple magazine.</P>
<P>They calculate the number of inhabitants at 24,000, including the garri&s;on, which con&s;i&s;ts of 5000 men. This city has three noble gates, adorned with ba&s;&s;o
<PB N="335" REF="359">
relievos, very beautifully executed. It is an ea&s;y hour's walk round the ramparts. The fortifications are well contrived, and in good order, and the town acquires great additional &s;trength, being almo&s;t &s;ur|rounded with the Neckar and Rhine, and &s;ituated in a flat, not commanded by any ri&s;ing ground.</P>
<P>The lives and manners of the inhabitants of this city &s;eem to be as uniform as the &s;treets and build|ings; no noi&s;e, mobs, or bu&s;tles; at mid-day every thing is as quiet as the &s;treets of London at mid|night, a pre&s;umption that the citizens are under &s;ome re&s;traint and di&s;cipline with the troops. The&s;e la&s;t perform their exerci&s;e every morning on the parade. All their motions, even tho&s;e of their bodies, are under the direction of the major's cane. For exam|ple, the major flouri&s;hes his cane&mdash;the drum gives a &s;ingle tap, and every man, under arms, rai&s;es his hand to his hat;&mdash;at a &s;econd &s;troke of the drum, they take off their hats, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to pray;&mdash; at a third, they fini&s;h their petitions, and put their hats on their heads again.&mdash;If any man has the a&s;&s;ur|ance to prolong his prayer a minute longer than the drum allows him, he is puni&s;hed on the &s;pot, and taught to be le&s;s devout in future.</P>
<P>At this court is kept a royal je&s;ter, the only re|maining in&s;tance of &s;uch an officer. <HI>Moore</HI> tells us, he dined with the Elector, that the table con&s;i&s;ted of
<PB N="336" REF="360">
thirty covers, and that with the de&s;ert, this je&s;ter in|troduced him&s;elf. He walked round the table, and conver&s;ed in a familiar manner with every body pre|&s;ent, the princes not excepted. He &s;poke German, but his ob&s;ervations being followed with loud bur&s;ts of applau&s;e, <HI>Moore</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed there was &s;ome wit in them, but not knowing the language, and being ill explained to him in French, he could not &s;ay, whe|ther the wit was keen or not.</P>
<P>Heidelberg is the capital of the electorate, &s;ituated in a hollow on the banks of the Neckar, &s;urrounded by charming hills properly cultivated, enjoying a whole&s;ome air and good water. The city is but &s;mall, but it is finely built. The Elector's ca&s;tle is placed on an eminence which commands the town, and a view of the valley below; but the ca&s;tle it&s;elf is com|manded by another eminence near it, from which this noble building has been and may be cannonad|ed. In this ca&s;tle &s;tands the famous Heidelberg tun, which was repaired in 1727, and decorated with a great variety of ornaments. It is &s;ometimes full of wine, and holds 204 tons of liquor. The head of this ca&s;k is railed round, &s;o that &s;everal per&s;ons may walk about, and have an entertainment on it. It was made by order of the Elector in 1664, the weight of the iron hoops is one hundred and ten quintals; on it is the following in&s;cription in High Dutch.</P>
<Q><PB N="337" REF="361">
<L>God ble&s;s the Elector of the Rhine,</L>
<L>From year to year with gen'rous wine.</L></Q>
<P>The univer&s;ity has fourteen profe&s;&s;ors, about 180 prote&s;tant &s;tudents, and eighty Roman-catholic ones.</P>
<P>The Calvini&s;ts are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of St. Peter's church, the Lutherans, of the church of Providence; but the next church is divided into two apartments, in one of which the prote&s;tants, and in the other the pa|pi&s;ts perform public wor&s;hip, a &s;ingular proof of their moderation. Be&s;ides the&s;e there is a fine college of je&s;uits, and &s;ix other cloi&s;ters, all with churches, and a univer&s;ity, with Calvini&s;t and Roman-catholic pro|fe&s;&s;ors. The bridge on the Neckar is covered. From Heidelberg runs an avenue to Schwetzingen, a hunt|ing palace of the Elector's, lying at one hour's di&s;|tance from the city.</P>
<P>About two leagues from Heidelberg, the Berg&s;tra&s;&s;e or mountain-road begins, in travelling along which, an Italian is &s;aid to have broke out into this exclama|tion: <HI>O Germania, Germania, quam velles e&s;&s;e Italia!</HI> that is, O Germany, Germany, how fain would'&s;t thou be Italy! The Berg&s;tra&s;&s;e extends as far as Darm&s;tadt, but the be&s;t part of it is from Heidelberg to Ben|&s;heim, where it is about eight leagues long and four broad. This continued chain of hills and eminences
<PB N="338" REF="362">
on the right, is covered with woods near the top, and nearer the plain with vineyards. The level road is all along planted with rows of walnut-trees, with fields and meadows of an exuberant fertility on each &s;ide, and the eye is entertained with a variety of fine and exten&s;ive pro&s;pects.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP XII.</HI> Of the Circle of Franconia.</HEAD>
<P>MODERN Franconia lies almo&s;t in the heart of Germany, and is bounded by He&s;&s;e and Thurin|gia N. Bavaria E. Swabia S. and the Lower Rhine on the W. It extends about 130 miles from E. to W. and 100 from N. to S. The &s;oil is fertile and the coun|try beautifully diver&s;ified with hills and valleys, pro|ducing great plenty of corn and wine. Its principal rivers are the Maine and the Sala; the latter of which gives name to the country where the famous Salique law was made, which re&s;trains the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the heirs male.</P>
<P>This circle comprehends the bi&s;hoprics of Wurt&s;|burg, Bamberg, and Aich&s;tat, &s;ubject to their re&s;pective bi&s;hops; the marqui&s;ates of Cullenbach and An|&s;pach, &s;ubject to their re&s;pective margraves; the
<PB N="339" REF="363">
principality of Henneberg, the duchy of Co|burg, &s;ubject to its own duke, and the duchy of Hil|burghau&s;en, &s;ubject to its dukes; the burgravate of Nuremberg, an independant &s;tate; the territory of the great ma&s;ter of the Teutonic order, Margentheim, and the counties of Reineck; Bareith, &s;ubject to its own margrave; Paphenheim, &s;ubject to its own count; Wertheim, Middle Ca&s;&s;el, Schwartzburg, &s;ubject to its own count, and Holach; all having chief towns of the re&s;pective names of tho&s;e places. The &s;ummon|ing princes of the circle are the bi&s;hop of Bamberg and the margraves of Brandenburg, Bayreith and An&s;pach. In point of religion, this circle is one of the mixed. Of the cities we &s;hall &s;peak only of Wurt&s;burg, and Nuremberg.</P>
<P>Wurtzburg is the capital of Franconia, and &s;tands on the river Main, &s;ixty miles E. of Frankfort in lat. 49 deg. N. The river runs through the middle of the town, over which is a very fine &s;tone bridge 300 paces long. The Bi&s;hop's palace &s;tands on an emi|nence in the &s;uburbs of the town, from which there is a delightful pro&s;pect of the city and the adjacent country.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop has a great extent of country under his juri&s;diction, in which it is computed there are no le&s;s than 400 villages. It is one of the riche&s;t bi&s;hoprics in the country, and contains within the dioce&s;e 190,000 people. He is an ab&s;olute prince in his own domini|ons,
<PB N="340" REF="364">
and lives in all the &s;tate of a &s;overeign monarch. In his equipage, a &s;word of &s;tate is carried before him; and at the diet of the empire, he takes the fifth place on the &s;piritual bench. But in the circle of Franconia he has the fir&s;t voice.</P>
<P>The town is divided into eight parts, viz. four quarters and four &s;uburbs, and has a univer&s;ity. The prevailing religion here is the Roman-catholic, but there are al&s;o Lutheran and Calvini&s;t churches within the juri&s;diction of the city. The Bi&s;hop's palace is one of the fine&s;t in Germany. The town is &s;eated in a large plain, very fruitful in vines, and watered by the Mayne.</P>
<P>There is among the people here &s;uch an alacrity, &s;uch a love for the plea&s;ures of the &s;en&s;es, and free|dom of intercour&s;e between the two &s;exes, as be&s;peaks very &s;trongly the great affluence and ea&s;e of the coun|try. Wurt&s;burg has a fine manufactory of looking-gla&s;&s;es and china. The prebends of the cathedral are worth 350l. a year, &s;everal prebendaries have four or five prebends in as many cathedrals, and re|ceive from 20 to 30,000 florins a year. The whole trouble of a German canon con&s;i&s;ts in a month's re|&s;idence yearly, and no other qualification is required of him, than to be able to read Latin, and prove him&s;elf de&s;cended from a good family on the mother's &s;ide. It is credibly a&s;&s;erted, that every canon of Wurt&s;burg, at his fir&s;t entrance into the chapter, receives a &s;troke
<PB N="341" REF="365">
with a &s;witch from each of his colleagues. This ex|traordinary inauguration is continued with a view of preventing any prince (who, of cour&s;e, cannot &s;ub|mit to &s;uch a ceremony) from de&s;iring to be of the chapter.</P>
<P>Nuremberg or Nurenberg is an ugly town, which grows daily more and more de&s;erted: at the end of the thirteenth century it contained above 50,000 men, who were not above one fourth of the whole, whereas the whole population now &s;carce amounts to a &s;ixth part of the number. Many hundred hou&s;es &s;tand quite empty, and the re&s;t are tenanted only by &s;in|gle families.</P>
<P>This bi&s;hop is &s;upreme head of the Imperial tribu|nal e&s;tabli&s;hed in the circle, and all the neighbouring &s;tates appeal to his duchy court in matters of litiga|tion. This college of ju&s;tice con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;piritual re|gency to &s;ettle all epi&s;copal differences; a vicarate which determines all di&s;putes relating to religious per|&s;ons and things, and a con&s;i&s;toral, which has the management of matrimonial affairs; be&s;ides the&s;e there are five other councils for temporalities. The epi&s;co|pal revenues are e&s;timated at 800,000 Rheni&s;h florins, each florin 1s. 2d. Be&s;ides this the bi&s;hop holds the &s;ee of Bamberg, worth 70,000l. Engli&s;h for ever. There are five regiments of hor&s;e and foot, which are maintained at the expence of the Bi&s;hop, and are un|der the direction of his aulic council of war.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="366">The burgravate of Nurenberg is an independent &s;tate. The city, which bears the &s;ame name, is a well built town, &s;ituate forty miles S. of Bamberg, and as many N. of Ingold&s;tat, in the very heart of Germany, and centre of Europe. It contains, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> 128 principal &s;treets, 400 lanes, and is adorned with twelve large and 133 &s;maller fountains, be&s;ides 117 wells. There are &s;ixteen churches, forty-four religi|ous hou&s;es, and ten markets, and it takes up three hours to walk round the city and its &s;uburbs. The river Pegnitz runs through the town and divides it in equal parts, over which there are twelve bridges, &s;ix of &s;tone, and &s;ix of wood; but the river is not navi|gable. The town is environed with double walls, and fortified with 365 towers, and a broad deep ditch in circuit about five miles. The number of hou&s;es are about 8000, none of which are extraordinary build|ings.</P>
<P>This city &s;tands in a plain, therefore enjoys a tem|perature of air and whole&s;omene&s;s of climate, as the extremes of the &s;ea&s;ons are thereby precluded from exerci&s;ing their inten&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>In curio&s;ities this city may compare with mo&s;t cities in Germany. In the town-hou&s;e are &s;everal valuable paintings, among&s;t which are, one of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> with the child <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> by <HI>Cranach;</HI> and another of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> by <HI>Albert Durer,</HI> both of which are well worth the traveller's curious eye; each of them
<PB N="343" REF="367">
are &s;aid to be worth 50,000 dollars! But the former are only &s;hewn to reigning princes, per&s;ons de&s;cended from ancient noble hou&s;es, and the amba&s;&s;adors of emperors.</P>
<P>Nuremberg has had the honour for many centuries pa&s;t to keep the Imperial crown, jewels, and relicks. In the latter of which is &s;aid to be a tooth of St. <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, three links of the chain with which St. <HI>Peter,</HI> St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI> were bound; a piece of the manger wherein Chri&s;t lay when an infant, an arm of St. <HI>Ann;</HI> a piece of the table cloth u&s;ed by Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples at the la&s;t &s;upper, the &s;pear with which his &s;ide was pierced, and five thorns of his crown! Such is the gro&s;s &s;uper&s;tition of this catholic repo&s;itory!</P>
<P>The new church and that of St. <HI>Sebbald</HI> are very well worth &s;eeing. There is a fine library in the pre|dicant convent, containing near 60,000 volumes. The olde&s;t of which is &s;aid to be of 800 years &s;tanding, and contains the primitive liturgy in Greek, finely illuminated.</P>
<P>The ar&s;enal contains 274 large pieces of bra&s;s can|non, and 18,000 &s;tands of arms. The &s;mall arms are very beautifully di&s;po&s;ed in the form of columns, &s;hields, &s;uns, trophies, and the arms of the city; cu|riou&s;ly arranged, like tho&s;e in the tower of London.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="368">This opulent, Imperial city, keeps in con&s;tant pay &s;even companies of foot, 100 men each, with &s;everal troops of cavalry, and a large body of artillery. The ob&s;ervatory is in a ca&s;tle, which &s;tands on the top of a hill in the middle of the town, and well worth in&s;pec|tion. There are &s;everal elegant pieces of &s;tatuary to be &s;een in various parts of the town; al&s;o the foun|tains are very remarkable for their order and con|&s;truction.</P>
<P>There are divers other curio&s;ities and mu&s;eums to be &s;een here, &s;o that the philo&s;opher and virtuo&s;o will find very agreeable entertainment for &s;everal weeks, in exploring the numerous collections of art and nature.</P>
<P>But few things de&s;erve a traveller's notice more than a machine which is put in motion by water, where the &s;ilver ingots are drawn through a &s;ucce&s;&s;i|on of &s;mall holes, gradually le&s;&s;ening into the fine&s;t &s;ilver wire imaginable. Though it is obvious to the &s;en&s;es, yet it is difficult to form an adequate idea of the incredible exten&s;ion of metals, as it is here per|formed, until it is demon&s;trated by computation. A cy|linder of &s;ilver weighing nine ounces, 12 penny-weights, and about twenty-two inches in length, in the hands of the wire-drawer becomes above nine thou&s;and times &s;maller in diameter, and is drawn out to a length of 224 Engli&s;h miles. But the ductility and exten&s;ion of gold, by this method, is &s;till more wonderful. As

the &s;ilver cylinder of twenty-two inches in length, is gilt before it is drawn into wire, the thickne&s;s of the gold laid on it dimini&s;hes in proportion to the length, to which the cylinder or the wire is extended.</P>
<P>The gold at fir&s;t is commonly but the ninetieth part of a line in thickne&s;s, and never exceeds an en|tire line, &s;o that only &s;ix ounces, oftentimes two, and &s;ometimes but one ounce is u&s;ed for gilding a cy|linder of twenty-two inches in length. If the gilding be computed at two ounces to the above-mentioned cylinder, it may be demon&s;trated by the drawing of the &s;ilver, that the exten&s;ion of the gold &s;urface is &s;o great, that a &s;ingle ounce of gold (1220 of which go to a cubic foot) is &s;ufficient to cover 1190 &s;quare feet of &s;ilver. When the gold is thus extended, its thickne&s;s is but 75,000&frac12; part of a line. But, as I ob&s;erved before, the gilding of a cylinder of &s;ilver weighing nine ounces, 12 penny-weights, may be per|formed with one ounce of gold, it is evident that the latter may be drawn to that finene&s;s, that it &s;hall not exceed 525,025th part of a line. The con&s;ideration of &s;uch ductility mu&s;t ab&s;orb the human mind and elude its comprehen&s;ion; e&s;pecially if we reflect, that even this amazing tenuity may be doubled to 1,050,080th part of a line, a line being but the 12th part of an inch. That the gold does not only com|municate its colour to the &s;ilver, but that its con&s;ti|tuent parts remain in their natural arrangement, is proved by the following experiment. viz. If you lay
<PB N="346" REF="370">
the gold wire in aquafortis, it will corrode the &s;ilver, but without damaging the gold in the lea&s;t, for &s;uch wire or thread becomes a hollow tube, of a finene&s;s beyond imagination.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are fond of mechanical arts and manu|factures, may here abundantly gratify their curio&s;ity. It is a town filled with an abundance of the works of art and nature; and may, with ju&s;tice, be e&s;teemed the fir&s;t city in Europe for &s;ingular productions and curious &s;ubjects of in&s;pection.</P>
<P>Here is an anatomical theatre founded at the ex|pence of the city, in which are near one hundred &s;ke|letons of different animals, e&s;pecially of the winged tribe. The &s;keleton of a tortoi&s;e, that was di&s;&s;ected here, &s;hews that the outward &s;hell makes a part of its body. The amphi&s;baena is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have two heads, but in the &s;erpent pre&s;erved here in &s;pi|rits, which goes under that name, the head and tail are manife&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hable. Dr. <HI>Treu's</HI> cabinet contains a collection of near 6000 plants, &s;everal pe|trifactions, all kinds of &s;eeds, and many curious &s;keletons of leaves and fruit; Dr. <HI>Thoma&s;ius's</HI> 800 vo|lumes of epi&s;tles of learned men, and a very exten&s;ive collection of coins and medals. In a word, there are &s;uch a number of private collections in this place, of natural and artificial curio&s;ities, that it would be endle&s;s to enumerate them.</P>

<P><PB N="347" REF="372">The vocal mu&s;icians and &s;ingers here who have a great affinity to the <HI>bardi</HI> and <HI>&s;caldi</HI> of the ancient Ger|mans, generally hold their meetings on fe&s;tivals, and perform even in private hou&s;es for money. Mu|&s;ic flouri&s;hes greatly at Nurenberg, where they have frequently their <HI>krantzel</HI> or concerts.</P>
<P>Conver&s;ation with the fair &s;ex is under much greater re&s;traint at Nurenberg, than in mo&s;t other large cities. A &s;tranger is &s;eldom allowed to &s;ee them in the a&s;&s;emblies, which they held among one ano|ther, and even the natives of the place are not ad|mitted, unle&s;s they are particular friends. And al|though a foreigner is recommended to a Nurem|berger in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, he will very &s;eldom invite him to his hou&s;e, if he has a wife or daughter, but is &s;o mi&s;tru&s;tful, that he rather chu&s;es to carry him to a tavern, and there do him the honour of a <HI>kau&s;che,</HI> that is, make him drunk.</P>
<P>The &s;hops of this city are loaded with mer|chandize, and the commonalty are clean and chear|ful, though the &s;treets are narrow and dirty. A &s;ort of &s;habby finery is perceptable among&s;t the qua|lity. Here there are e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;umptuary laws, which di&s;tingui&s;h men of rank by their dre&s;s, and pre|vent the exce&s;s which ruins &s;o many other cities. The plate exhibits a gentleman, his lady, and a pea&s;ant.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="373">When one con&s;iders impartially the merit of a rich &s;uit of clothes in mo&s;t places, the re&s;pect and the &s;miles of favour it procures, not to &s;peak of the envy and &s;ighs it occa&s;ions, which is very often the principal charm to the wearer; one is obliged to con|fe&s;s, that there is no need of an uncommon under|&s;tanding to re&s;i&s;t the temptation of plea&s;ing friends and mortifying rivals; and that it is natural to the inexperienced to fall into errors, which betrays them into various &s;pecies of folly and extreme poverty.</P>
<P>This town has the greate&s;t trade of any place on the continent, if we con&s;ider that it has neither a navigable river or any water-carriage convenient. Their artificers in wood, iron, &s;teel, ivory, alaba&s;ter, &amp;c. are &s;aid to be inimitable, and afford their goods very cheap. It is from this part of Germany that tho&s;e toys, which we call Dutch toys are imported here. The annual profit to the city from tho&s;e toys, ex|ceed 17,500l. &s;terling; in 1728, as many were &s;old at Con&s;tantinople only, as amounted to 1983l. It is nothing but the genius and extraordinary diligence of the people, that procures this flouri&s;hing trade and plenty; for they live in a barren country, which affords &s;carce any merchandize to traffic with, but what receives the greate&s;t part of its value from their labour and ingenuity.</P>
<P>Nurenberg has long produced arti&s;ts, who vie with the be&s;t Engli&s;h ones in making mathematical and
<PB N="349" REF="374">
phy&s;ical in&s;truments. You meet no where out of England, with &s;uch good manufactures in &s;teel, iron, and copper, as in this place, and will any man con|demn their making of toys amid&s;t their more import|ant bu&s;ine&s;s, when it gives a u&s;eful and profitable em|ployment to their wives and children?</P>
<P>The great cau&s;e of the ruin of this town is the Au&s;trians. The government is in the hands of twenty or thirty families, who very ill treat the re&s;t of the citizens. Every trade&s;man here taxes him&s;elf, he gives in an account of his property, and if he mi&s;|tates it, is liable to have his books examined, &s;o that the rich citizens have left the place, and taken refuge in the Au&s;trian or Pru&s;&s;ian territories.</P>
<P>The morals of the Nurenbergers are better and purer than tho&s;e of any other German city. The magi&s;trate is particular anxious to put a &s;top to for|nication, and it is a fact, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> that the young men of the city, at one particular time, underwent a medical vi&s;itation by &s;ome of the members of the ma|gi&s;tracy, attended by phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion here is the Lutheran; the Roman-catholics are only allowed to perform divine &s;ervice in a church of the Lutherans when they have done with it. The Calvini&s;ts are not allowed any public place of wor&s;hip, but are forced to go to church &s;ome di&s;tance out of town.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="375">The governors and principal magi&s;trates of the city are elected out of the nobility and gentry. The com|mon-council con&s;i&s;ts of forty-two members, of whom thirteen are burgo-ma&s;ters, and as many aldermen; the re&s;t are only &s;tiled elders or &s;ages of the people. One burgo-ma&s;ter has the military, and one alderman the civil government of the city, for a month, and are then &s;ucceeded by two more; &s;o that there is a burgo-ma&s;ter and an alderman for every month of the year, in whom the executive power is ve&s;ted in by turns.</P>
<P>The ordinary affairs of the government are debated in the common-council. The rai&s;ing of forces or levying taxes are equally referred to a &s;elect number of the common-council, &s;tiled, by way of eminence, the eight. And, upon any extraordinary emergency, the principal burghers, elected out of every trade and profe&s;&s;ion in the town, are &s;ummoned to the number of 400, who have al&s;o the power of electing the members of the other councils, and of the magi|&s;trates of the place, which are cho&s;en annually.</P>
<P>The Nurenbergers have a country of about twen|ty miles in extent, and &s;everal towns and villages under their juri&s;diction, which is a more con&s;iderable territory than any other Imperial city. The number of its &s;ubjects, in the country, is e&s;timated at 400,000. Their villages are very pretty, though a great deal of &s;and about them, and every thing be&s;ides has a great degree of opulence in the farmers, who, as well as the town's people, remain faithful to their old dre&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE TERRITORY OF THE GRAND MASTER OF THE TEUTONIC ORDER.</HEAD>
<P>Margentheim is a &s;mall city, &s;ituated on the river Tauber, twenty-two miles W. of Wurt&s;burg, where the great ma&s;ter of the Teutonic order hath his re&s;i|dence; it is the capital of the &s;mall territory belong|ing to him. There are no particularities that are worth di&s;tingui&s;hing in it. I will only ob&s;erve, that the knights of this order po&s;&s;e&s;s thirteen commande|ries in Germany, and have a right to chu&s;e their grand ma&s;ter out of the princes of the empire, who, in con&s;equence of this election, has the fir&s;t &s;eat in the diet after the electors. The knights, on their admi&s;&s;ion, are obliged to prove their nobility, for &s;ix|teen de&s;cents, both by father and mother.</P>
<P>The arms and en&s;igns of this order are; an erect cro&s;s <HI>&s;able</HI> in a field <HI>argent,</HI> which arms Pope <HI>Cele&s;tine</HI> III. granted to it. In the field is a cro&s;s, <HI>or,</HI> which was conferred by King <HI>Henry</HI> of Jeru&s;alem; and in the center is to be &s;een the Imperial eagle, be&s;towed by the Emperor <HI>Frederick</HI> II. At each of the four corners is a lily, <HI>or,</HI> which was added to the&s;e arms by Saint <HI>Louis</HI> of France.</P>
<P>This Teutonic order was founded in Pale&s;tine in 1190, and the knights of this order were called knights of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> or brothers of the Teutonic hou&s;e of our lady of Jeru&s;alem. They bound them&s;elves by
<PB N="352" REF="377">
vow to the defence of the chri&s;tian religion and the Holy Land, and to the &s;ervice of the poor and &s;ick, to be all of them Germans, and to be of true ancient nobility. This order removed from Venice to Mar|burg, and thence to Marienburg in Ru&s;&s;ia, gradually &s;ubdued all Ru&s;&s;ia, Courland, Semi-gallia, and Livo|nia, but lo&s;t them again, &s;ince which time, the grand ma&s;terdom is become little better than a mere title.</P>
<P>Both Roman-catholics and prote&s;tants may be in|ve&s;ted with this order, and the prote&s;tant knights are permitted to marry. On &s;olemn occa&s;ions the knights wear a white mantle, with a black cro&s;s on it, edged with a rim of &s;ilver. In other re&s;pects, their dre&s;s is the &s;ame with that of the &s;eculars.</P>
<P>The &s;eigniories and elders which the Teutonic order is &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in Germany, and which they ob|tained partly by purcha&s;e, and partly by donation, lying contiguous, would form a con&s;iderable principa|lity. The&s;e elders con&s;i&s;t of what is properly called the ma&s;terdom of Margentheim, and 12 bailiwicks, in which the grand ma&s;ter exerci&s;es &s;uch a &s;overeign|ty, as at pre&s;ent the &s;tate of the empire enjoys. The remainder of Franconia is compo&s;ed of a num|ber of &s;mall principalities, where the people in gene|ral &s;uffer great oppre&s;&s;ion from their &s;overeigns, who re&s;ide at the great courts; &s;pending their money away from them, and leaving them to the plunder of their de&s;potic agents.</P>
