<P>THIS Journey is the continuation of my Tour in WALES.

<P>THIS book contains a journey from my own hou&s;e to the &s;ummit of <HI>Snowdon,</HI> and takes in almo&s;t the whole of our <HI>Alpine</HI> tract.</P>
<P>As far as the Title announces, it is complete. A more general Title-Page will be given with the &s;econd part, and the journey continued regularly from p. 183.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3">I THANK my friends for variety of information, and mu&s;t pre&s;ent my particular acknowlegements to Sir JOHN SEBRIGHT, Baronet, for his liberal communication of &s;e|veral of the late Mr. EDWARD LLWYD'S Manu&s;cripts, which have flung great light on &s;everal parts of our hi&s;tory.

<P>IN this, the &s;equel of my former tour, I directed my cour&s;e we&s;tward from <HI>Downing,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Whiteford,</HI> our pari&s;h-church, and a&s;cended the hill of <HI>Garreg,</HI> or the <HI>Rock,</HI> a high and mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of the country. The <HI>Romans</HI> took ad|vantage of it, and placed on its &s;ummit a <HI>Pharos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A PHAROS.</NOTE> to conduct the navigators to and from <HI>Deva,</HI> along the difficult channel of the <HI>Seteia Portus.</HI> The building is &s;till remaining. I hope my friends will not deem me an antiquarian <HI>Quixote,</HI> and imagine me mi&s;|taking, in this my &s;econd &s;ally, a building, hitherto &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a wind-mill, for a <HI>Roman</HI> light-hou&s;e. It is tolerably entire; its form is circular; the height con&s;iderable; the inner diameter twelve feet and a half; the thickne&s;s of the walls four feet four inches. The doors, or entrances, are oppo&s;ite to each other: over each is a &s;quare funnel, like a chimney, which opens on the out&s;ide, about half way up the building. On each &s;ide is
<PB N="2" REF="6">
a window. About four feet from the ground are three circular holes, lined with mortar, as is frequent in <HI>Roman</HI> buildings; and penetrate the whole wall, for purpo&s;es now unknown.</P>
<P>WITHINSIDE are the ve&s;tiges of a &s;tair-ca&s;e, which led to the floors, of which there appear to have been two. Along &s;uch part of the upper, which was con&s;picuous from the channel, are eight &s;mall &s;quare openings, ca&s;ed with free-&s;tone (the re&s;t of the build|ing being of rude lime-&s;tone, bedded in hard mortar) and each of the&s;e were &s;eparated by wooden pannels, placed in deep grooves, the la&s;t &s;till in a perfect &s;tate. In each of the&s;e partitions were placed the lights, which the <HI>Romans</HI> thought nece&s;&s;ary to keep di&s;tinct, or to prevent from running into one, le&s;t they &s;hould be mi&s;taken by &s;eamen for a &s;tar. <HI>Periculum in corrivatione ignium, ne &s;idus exi&s;timetur</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hi&s;t. Nat.</HI> lib. xxxvi. c. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the building is very evidently a broad and rai&s;ed road, pointing from the ea&s;t; and near its upper end are the marks of a trench, which &s;urrounded and gave protection to this u&s;eful edi|fice. De&s;cend, and near the foot of the hill leave on the left <HI>Maen Achwynfan,</HI> the cro&s;s de&s;cribed in my former tour. <HI>Glol,</HI> an inclo&s;ed mountain a little farther on, has among the bu&s;hes various circular foundations of &s;tone unmortared building. About a mile from hence, <NOTE PLACE="marg">NEWMARKET.</NOTE> vi&s;it the &s;mall town of <HI>Newmarket,</HI> almo&s;t the entire creation of its then owner, <HI>John Wynne,</HI> <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Gop,</HI> who died in the pre&s;ent century. The antient name of the pari&s;h is <HI>Tre|lawnyd,</HI> for which I can find no &s;atisfactory rea&s;on. In the church-yard is a hand&s;ome old cro&s;s. Here is fixed one of the charity-&s;chcols, founded and opened in 1726, by doctor <HI>Daniel Williams,</HI> a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, with an endowment of eight pounds a year; a charity which he extended to every county in <HI>North Wales,</HI> di&s;|tingui&s;hing that at <HI>Wrexham,</HI> the place of his birth, by an annual
<PB N="3" REF="7">
&s;alary of fifteen pounds. He al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed a fund, I believe, to each, from which the children are apprenticed, at five pounds apiece.</P>
<P>FROM the town I a&s;cended the hill, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cor.</NOTE> called <HI>Copa'r'leni,</HI> on who&s;e &s;ummit is a mo&s;t enormous carnedd, or tumulus, formed of lime|&s;tones. It was probably the &s;ite of <HI>&s;pecula,</HI> or exploratory tower, and memorial of &s;ome chieftain. If <HI>Roman,</HI> perhaps <HI>Paulinus</HI> gave name to it, <HI>Cop-Paulini.</HI> There is great uncertainty in the&s;e derivations: I may po&s;&s;ibly as well abide by my former etymo|logy of <HI>Cop yr Goleuni,</HI> or the Mount of Lights; for it might have been a place of &s;ignals by fire of the approach of an enemy by &s;ea <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tour in Wales, i. 413.</NOTE>, or a <HI>&s;tation</HI> of the <HI>holy fires,</HI> the <HI>Coel Ceithie</HI> of the <HI>Druids,</HI> &s;imi|lar to the <HI>Karn Gollewa,</HI> the carn of lights, and <HI>Karn Le&s;kyz,</HI> or carn of burnings, of the <HI>Cornish,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed by the learned BORLASE <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Cornwall, 131.</NOTE> to have been u&s;ed for &s;imilar purpo&s;es. The tract from hence to <HI>Caerwys</HI> was certainly a field of battle: no place in <HI>North Wales</HI> exhibits an equal quantity of <HI>tumuli;</HI> but all &s;epulchral, as is proved by the urns di&s;covered in them: they are of a far inferior &s;ize to the fir&s;t, and covered with turf. It will not be too hazardous a conjecture to &s;uppo&s;e, that in this place was the &s;laughter of the <HI>Ordovices</HI> by <HI>Agricola,</HI> when our gallant nation was nearly extir|pated. Part of the brow of the hill is called <HI>Bryn y Saethiau,</HI> or <HI>the Hill of Arrows,</HI> from being the &s;tation of the archers in the en|gagement.</P>
<P>RETURN along the ridge of the hill, marked its whole length with verdant tumuli, the tombs of ancient heroes. See beneath
<PB N="4" REF="8">
me the little church of <HI>Gwaen-y&s;kor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GWAEN-YSKOR.</NOTE> remarkable for its ancient regi&s;ter.</P>
<P>DESCEND to the church and village of <HI>Llana&s;a,</HI> the former dedi|cated to <HI>St. A&s;aph,</HI> who&s;e fe&s;tival is kept on the fir&s;t of <HI>May.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANASA.</NOTE> <HI>Laurence Child,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>St. A&s;aph,</HI> in 1385, procured the impro|priation of this church to &s;upply his cathedral with lights <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willi's St. A&s;aph, 56, App. No. xxi.</NOTE>, and repair the ruins occa&s;ioned by the wars. In my approach from the&s;e high lands towards the &s;hore, ob&s;erve the ruins of a &s;mall chapel at the little hamlet of <HI>Gwe&s;pyr,</HI> near <HI>Trelacre,</HI> one of the &s;eats of Sir <HI>Pyers Mo&s;tyn,</HI> Baronet, a branch of the hou&s;e of <HI>Mo&s;tyn.</HI> His adjacent quarry is noted for the excellence of the free-&s;tone; and his va&s;t and profitable warren beneath, noted for the delicacy of the rabbets, by rea&s;on of their feeding on the maritime plants.</P>
<P>PASS over <HI>Gronant-Moor.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GRONANT.</NOTE> There is a tradition, that its extent was &s;o great, that the people on this &s;ide could hold conver&s;ation over the channel with tho&s;e of <HI>Che&s;hire.</HI> This may be exagge|rated; but from authentic records, it appears, that this flat was formerly very exten&s;ive, and that it had been reduced to its pre|&s;ent &s;canty limits by the fury of the &s;ea, which &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es its antient place. Previous to that cata&s;trophe, it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;ee of <HI>St. A&s;aph,</HI> by virtue of a grant made by <HI>Edward the Black Prince,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Edward</HI> III. to <HI>Llewelyn ap Madoc,</HI> elected Bi&s;hop of <HI>St. A&s;aph</HI> in 1357. The inundation happened before the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> V. Previous to that time, the Bi&s;hop paid annually into the exchequer at <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> as an acknowlegement, the &s;um of twenty marks: but <HI>Henry</HI> V. in 1414, and <HI>Henry</HI> VI. in 1445 and 1451, in con&s;ideration of the misfortune, relea&s;ed
<PB N="5" REF="9">
the &s;ee from that rent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willis's St. A&s;aph, 65. App. No. xxxi. xxxii.</NOTE>. If this record did not remain an incon|te&s;lable proof of the ravages of the ocean on this part of the coun|try, there exi&s;t other natural ones, that would have given rea|&s;onable grounds for &s;u&s;picion. The <HI>Hyle &s;ands,</HI> which run for twelve or fourteen miles parallel to the narrow hundred of <HI>Wiral,</HI> in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> and divided from <HI>Wales</HI> by a narrow channel, were once, in all probability, part of the firm land of <HI>England.</HI> A few miles to the we&s;t of <HI>Gronant-Moor,</HI> under the pari&s;h of <HI>Aber|geleu,</HI> in <HI>Denbigh&s;hire,</HI> are to be &s;een at low water, very remote from the &s;hore, bedded in the &s;and, immen&s;e numbers of oak-trees, a fore&s;t before this event. La&s;tly, in the church-yard wall of <HI>Abergelli</HI> is a datele&s;s epitaph, in <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> &s;ignifying the per&s;on who was interred there lived three miles to the north of that &s;pot, a tract now entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;ea.</P>
<P>ON approaching <HI>Pre&s;tatyn,</HI> about two miles from <HI>Trelacre,</HI> the flat becomes extremely fertile in corn, e&s;pecially wheat, which is of di&s;tingui&s;hed excellence; and continues equally noted through all the flat tract, as far as <HI>Ruddlan,</HI> where it is interrupted for a &s;pace by the mar&s;h, and is again continued along the coa&s;t far beyond <HI>Abergeleu.</HI> A little below <HI>Pre&s;tatyn</HI>-mill, in a meadow, is the &s;ite of its Ca&s;tle: nothing more than an elevated &s;pace, with foundations con&s;i&s;ting of &s;tone and mortar, and a fo&s;s at &s;ome di&s;|tance from it, now remain. <NOTE PLACE="marg">PRESTATYN-CASTLE.</NOTE> This little fortre&s;s was probably built by the <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> but wre&s;ted from them by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it in 1167, the only time I find any mention of it, when it was de&s;troyed by <HI>Owen Gwynedd, Cadwalader</HI> his brother,
<PB N="6" REF="10">
and <HI>Rees</HI> Prince of <HI>South Wales;</HI> and all <HI>Tegengle</HI> reduced to the power of its lawful &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE hamlet and village of <HI>Pre&s;tatyn</HI> lie in the pari&s;h of Meli|den. This place was granted by <HI>Richard</HI> I. to <HI>Robert Bana&s;ter,</HI> who enjoyed it for three years and a half, and built the town; which was de&s;troyed by <HI>Owen Gwynedd. Robert de Crevecoeur,</HI> in the &s;eventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> I. laid claim to it in right of his an|ce&s;tor, <HI>Bana&s;ter.</HI> An inqui&s;ition was made, before a jury of twenty-four men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sebright's MSS.</NOTE>: their determination was in favor of <HI>Robert;</HI> &s;ince I find, by another record, that he died po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of lands in <HI>Maelwr Sae&s;neg</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;tatyn,</HI> which he held by the &s;ervice of one knight's fee.</P>
<P>THE road from hence to <HI>Di&s;erth</HI> is extremely plea&s;ant, at the foot of high hills, rich in lead ore, with a fine and fertile flat to the right. The white rock makes a con&s;picuous figure on the left, and its &s;ides appeared deeply trenched by the miners in &s;earch of ore. Near this place is the beginning of the vale of <HI>Clwyd,</HI> and the ter|mination of the range of mountains, which bound it on the ea&s;t. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from hence lies the church of <HI>Di&s;erth,</HI> in a picture&s;que and romantic bottom, beneath &s;ome rude rocks: the church over&s;haded with great yews, and the &s;ingular figure of &s;ome of the tombs, form a mo&s;t &s;triking appearance. <NOTE PLACE="marg">DISERTH CHURCH.</NOTE> A water-fall in the deep and rounded hollow of a rock, finely darkened with ivy, once gave additional beauty to this &s;pot; but of late the di|verting of the waters to a mill, has robbed the place of this ele|gant variation. The &s;tream, which is little inferior to that of <HI>Holywell,</HI> flows principally from a &s;ingle well, called <HI>Fynnon A&s;a,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="11">
or <HI>St. A&s;aph's Well,</HI> in a dingle in the pari&s;h of <HI>Cwm,</HI> about a mile di&s;tant. The fountain is inclo&s;ed with &s;tone, in a polygonal form, and had formerly its votaries, like that of St. <HI>Winefrede.</HI></P>
<P>ABOVE <HI>Di&s;erth</HI> church, on a high rock, &s;tand the remains of its Ca&s;tle. We cannot trace the foundation of this fortre&s;s, which went by the names of <HI>Din-colyn, Ca&s;tell y Ffailon,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;tell Gerri</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Llwyd's Itin.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> It probably was <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> and the la&s;t of the chain of <HI>Briti&s;h po&s;ts</HI> on the <HI>Clwydian</HI> hills. <HI>Henry</HI> III. in 1241, fortified it <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Powel, 307.</NOTE>; but its date was but &s;hort, for in 1261 <HI>Llewelyn ap Gryffydd</HI> ra&s;ed both this ca&s;tle, and that of <HI>Diganwy</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Same, 326.</NOTE>. It was at a &s;iege of this place that <HI>Eineon,</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Ririd Vlaidd,</HI> was &s;lain <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Hengwrt, MS.</NOTE>. A cro&s;s was erected on the &s;pot, called <HI>Croes Eineon,</HI> the &s;haft of which, ornamented with &s;trange &s;culpture, now is &s;uppo&s;ed to form the &s;tile into the church-yard of <HI>Di&s;erth;</HI> in which is another cro&s;s, of very curious work|man&s;hip.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;tle occupied the &s;ummit of the rock, who&s;e &s;ides are e&s;carp&eacute;e, or cut &s;teep, to render the acce&s;s more difficult. On one part, beneath the top, is a &s;quare out-work, with fo&s;&s;es cut in part through the &s;olid lime-&s;tone. The fragments of the ca&s;tle &s;hew, that its ruin was not effected by time: they lie in va&s;t ma&s;&s;es, overthrown by mining, which was a common method of be&s;ieging, very long before the u&s;e of powder.</P>
<P>IN a field a little to the &s;outh of the ca&s;tle, is a ruinous build|ing, called <HI>Siamber Wen.</HI> This is &s;aid to have been the &s;eat of a Sir <HI>Robert Pounderling</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Llwyd's Itin.

<P>THE ca&s;tle had been a hand&s;ome building, in a &s;quare, with two extremes placed at oppo&s;ite corners, with a double round tower at each; and a &s;ingle one at the two other corners. <NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> The court forms an irregular octagon.

<P>To the &s;outh of the ca&s;tle, at about a furlong di&s;tance, is a large artificial mount, the &s;ite of another fortre&s;s, of very early date; the whole &s;urrounded by a very deep fo&s;s (including al&s;o the abby) which cro&s;&s;es from the margin of the bank, near the a&s;cent of the pre&s;ent road to <HI>St. A&s;aph,</HI> to another parallel road; near which it is continued, then turns and falls nearly into the &s;outhern part of the

<P>THE parlement &s;aid to have been held here in 1283, <NOTE PLACE="marg">JTS PARLEMENT.</NOTE> by <HI>Ed|ward</HI> I. was probably no more than a council a&s;&s;embled by the conqueror, to divide his new conque&s;ts into counties, and to give &s;alutary laws to the <HI>Wel&s;h;</HI> to aboli&s;h any antient cu&s;toms which the wi&s;e prince thought detrimental, and to introduce &s;uch of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as would prove of u&s;e.

<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Edward</HI> I. had fini&s;hed the fortifications of <HI>Rhuddlan,</HI> and filled his new town with inhabitants, he and bi&s;hop <HI>Anian</HI> II. made different petitions to the pope, to remove the &s;ee of <HI>St. A&s;aph</HI> to this place <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer,</HI> ii. 245, <HI>Willis's St. A&s;aph,</HI> 45.149.155.</NOTE> They urged the &s;olitude and in&s;ecurity of the former; its hazard from <HI>banditti;</HI> and the danger to which the body of the mo&s;t glorious confe&s;&s;or <HI>St. A&s;aph</HI> was continually expo&s;ed: and the king in particular adds, the great &s;afety of this place, by rea&s;on of the va&s;t works he had completed. But the&s;e petitions never took effect: fru&s;trated either by the death of the pope, or the exhortion of the archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to rebuild the cathedral on its antient &s;ite.</P>
<P>A LITTLE beyond the priory I de&s;cended the bank, <NOTE PLACE="marg">ST.

<P>ITS eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory may be &s;poken of with more certainty. When <HI>Kentigern,</HI> bi&s;hop of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> was driven from his &s;ee in 543, he retired into <HI>Wales,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;hed here a mona&s;tery for nine hundred and &s;ixty-five monks, in&s;tituted on the &s;ame plan with that of <HI>Bangor;</HI> part for labor, part for prayer. <NOTE PLACE="marg">SII.</NOTE> Here he built a church; and having won over the <HI>British</HI> prince <HI>Maglo|cunus,</HI> once his violent opponent, e&s;tabli&s;hed here a &s;ee, and was him&s;elf the fir&s;t bi&s;hop. Being recalled to <HI>Scotland,</HI> he nominated for &s;ucce&s;&s;or, <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> or <HI>Ha&s;&s;aph,</HI> a Briton of great piety and good family (being grand&s;on of <HI>Pabo pou Prydain).</HI> He died in 596, was buried in his cathedral, and gave name to the place.</P>
<P>THE church was fir&s;t built of wood; but &s;oon after, of &s;tone. In 1247, during the wars of <HI>Henry</HI> III. the dioce&s;e was de&s;troyed by fire and &s;word <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matthew Paris,</HI> 642.</NOTE>, and the bi&s;hop, who &s;ided with the Engli&s;h, obliged to live on alms. In 1282, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CATHEDRAL.</NOTE> the cathedral was burnt down; but ample amends was made to the &s;ee, by the grant of <HI>Edward</HI> I. of lands in <HI>Newmarket, Nannerch, Dincolyn, Cwed y Mynedd,</HI> and a rich mineral tract in <HI>Di&s;erth:</HI> four hundred and nine acres were given, each of which appears at that time to be valued at only

&s;ix-pence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE>. In 1402, the church underwent new misfortunes: being burnt by <HI>Owen Glyndwr,</HI> together with the palace, and ca|nons hou&s;es; who, &s;trange to &s;ay! &s;oon after brought over to his party, <HI>John Trevor,</HI> the injured bi&s;hop of the &s;ee, who was de|prived on account of his revolt. After this, the church remained in ruins for eighty years, when it was re-built by that worthy pre|late, <HI>Richard Redman.</HI> The &s;ame building &s;till remains, hand|&s;ome, plain, and neat. The pre&s;ent dean and chapter are now re|building (out of a fund ve&s;ted in them for that purpo&s;e) the choir, after the inevitable dilapidations of time in the &s;pace of near four hundred years. The good imitation of the gothic, and the happy copy in the ea&s;t window, of the noble remains in <HI>Tintern</HI> abby, will add no &s;mall beauty to the church, and credit to the idea.</P>

<P>I NOW &s;peak of the &s;ixth &s;on, <HI>Hugh;</HI> a per&s;on who&s;e u&s;eful life would give lu&s;tre to the greate&s;t family. This gentleman (after|wards Sir <HI>Hugh</HI>) di&s;played very early his great talents; and began, as we are told by him&s;elf, by &s;earching for coal within a mile of his native place. His attempt did not meet with &s;ucce&s;s: his genius was de&s;tined to act on a greater &s;tage. The Capital af|forded him ample &s;pace for his va&s;t attempts: few readers need be told, that he planned and brought to perfection, the great de|&s;ign of &s;upplying the city with water. This plan was meditated in the reign of <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> but no one was found bold enough to attempt it. In 1608, the dauntle&s;s WELSHMAN &s;tept forth, and SMOTE THE ROCK: and on <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1613, the waters flowed into the thir&s;ting metropolis. He brought it, in defiance of hills and vallies, reckoning every winding, near thirty-nine miles; conveyed it by aqueducts in &s;ome places; in others pierced the
<PB N="30" REF="34">
high grounds, and gave it a &s;ubterraneous cour&s;e. He was a true prototype of the later genius of &s;imilar works; but he &s;acrificed private fortune to the public good. Two thou&s;and pounds a month, which he gained from the <HI>Cardigan&s;hire</HI> mines, were &s;wallowed up in this river<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fodina Regales.</HI> 32.</NOTE>. He received the empty honor of &s;eeing him&s;elf attended by the king, his court, and all the corpo|ration of <HI>London,</HI> among whom was his brother (de&s;igned mayor for the en&s;uing year). The waters gu&s;hed out in their pre&s;ence, and the great architect received their applau&s;e, and knighthood; and, in 1622, the title of baronet. His own fair fortune being expended on an undertaking, which now brings in to the pro|prietors an amazing revenue, he was reduced to become a hireling &s;urveyor, and was eminently u&s;eful in every place where draining or mining was requi&s;ite. I &s;hall have occa|&s;ion to &s;peak of &s;ome other of his labors in the cour&s;e of this book. He died in 1631<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Myddelton Pedegree MS.</NOTE>. Sir &mdash; <HI>Myddelton,</HI> the la&s;t baronet of this branch of the family, died a few years ago.

<P>IN rummaging over the family papers of this hou&s;e, I met with an anecdote of it, too &s;ingular to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. It will prove at left, that private morals, and re&s;pect to the laws, were in that di&s;tant period but in a very low &s;tate; for no notice &s;eems to have been taken of &s;o atrocious an offence.

<P>HAVING made <HI>Gwaenynog</HI> my head quarters for this neighbor|hood, I one day vi&s;ited from thence <HI>Henllan,</HI> the pari&s;h church of the&s;e parts; remarkable for the &s;chi&s;m between church and &s;teeple: the fir&s;t having retreated into the bottom, the la&s;t maintains its &s;ta|tion on the top of the hill.

<P>PROCEED to <HI>Llandrillo,</HI> a village with a church dedicated to <HI>St. Trillo.</HI> It is &s;eated on the torrent <HI>Keidio,</HI> at the mouth of a great glen, which extends upwards of two miles, embo&s;omed in the <HI>Berwyn</HI> mountains, and leads to the noted pa&s;s through them, called <HI>Milter Gerrig,</HI> into the county of <HI>Montgomery.</HI></P>
<P>AT about a mile di&s;tance from <HI>Llandrillo,</HI> I again cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Dee,</HI> at <HI>Pont Gilan,</HI> a bridge of two arches, over a deep and black water. Beyond this &s;pot, the valley acquires new beauties, e&s;pe|cially on the right. The valley here contracts greatly: the road runs at the foot of a brow, of a &s;tupendous height, covered with venerable oaks, which have kept their &s;tubborn &s;tation, amid&s;t the rude&s;t of rocks, which every now and then &s;hew their grey and broken fronts, amid&s;t the deep verdure of the foliage of trees, which &s;o &s;trangely find nutriment among&s;t them. The growth of the oak, in forcing its root downward, frequently rends th&s;e va&s;t &s;trata, who&s;e fragments often appear &s;cattered at the ba&s;e, of mo&s;t amazing &s;izes. The whole &s;cenery requires the pencil of a <HI>Sal|vator Ro&s;a:</HI> and here our young arti&s;ts would find a fit place to &s;tudy the manner of that great painter of wild nature.</P>

<P>REACH <HI>Bala,</HI> a &s;mall town in the pari&s;h of <HI>Llanyekil,</HI> noted for its va&s;t trade in woollen &s;tockings, and its great markets every <HI>Saturday</HI> morning, when from two to five hundred pounds worth are &s;old each day, according to the demand.

<PB N="68" REF="73">
in this effeminate employ. During winter the females, through love of &s;ociety, often a&s;&s;emble at one another's hou&s;es to knit; &s;it round a fire, and li&s;ten to &s;ome old tale, or to &s;ome an|tient &s;ong, or the &s;ound of a harp; and this is called <HI>Cymmorth Gwau,</HI> or, the knitting a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>MUCH of the wool is bought at the great fairs at <HI>Llanrw&s;t,</HI> in <HI>Denbigh&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>CLOSE to the &s;outh-ea&s;t end of the town, is a great artificial mount,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMMEN Y BALA.</NOTE> called <HI>Tommen y Bala,</HI> in the &s;ummer time u&s;ually covered in a picture&s;que manner with knitters, of both &s;exes, and all ages. From the &s;ummit is a fine view of <HI>Llyn-tegid,</HI> and the adjacent mountains. On the right appear the two <HI>Arennigs, Vawr</HI> and <HI>Vach;</HI> beyond the farther end, &s;oar the lofty <HI>Arans,</HI> with their two heads, <HI>Aran Mowddwy</HI> and <HI>Penllyn;</HI> and beyond all, the great <HI>Cader Idris</HI> clo&s;es the view.</P>
<P>THIS mount appears to have been <HI>Roman,</HI> and placed here, with a ca&s;telet on its &s;ummit, to &s;ecure the pa&s;s towards the &s;ea, and keep our mountaneers in &s;ubjection. The Wel&s;h, in after time, took advantage of this, as well as other works of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>THE town is of a very regular form: the principal &s;treet very &s;pacious, and the le&s;&s;er fall into it at right angles. I will not deny, but that its origin might have been <HI>Roman.</HI></P>
<P>THE mounts form a chain.

<P><HI>Bala</HI> takes its name from its vicinity to the place where a river di&s;charges it&s;elf from a lake. <HI>Balloch</HI> in the <HI>Er&s;e</HI> language &s;igni|fies the &s;ame. I know little of its antient hi&s;tory, any more than it &s;eems to have been dependent on the ca&s;tle of <HI>Harlech;</HI> and that, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> II. it was committed to the care of <HI>Finian de Stanedon,</HI> con&s;table of that ca&s;tle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sebright MSS.</NOTE>; and in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> III. his great general, <HI>Walter de Manni,</HI> was rewarded with the fee-farm of <HI>Bala</HI> and <HI>Harlech,</HI> and was made &s;heriff of this county for life<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Baron</HI> ii 149.</NOTE>.

<P><HI>Bala Lake, Pimble Mere,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LAKS.</NOTE> or <HI>Llyn-tegid,</HI> lies at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the town; and is a fine expan&s;e of water, near four miles long, and twelve hundred yards broad in the wide&s;t place: the deepe&s;t part is oppo&s;ite <HI>Bryn Golen,</HI> where it is forty-&s;ix yards deep, with three yards of mud; the &s;hores gravelly: the bounda|ries are ea&s;y &s;lopes, well cultivated, and varied with woods. In &s;tormy weather, its billows run very high, and incroach greatly on the north-ea&s;t end, where, within memory of man, numbers of acres have been lost. It ri&s;es &s;ometimes nine feet, and rains and
<PB N="70" REF="76">
winds jointly contribute to make it overflow the fair vale of <HI>Edeirnion.</HI></P>
<P>ITS fi&s;h are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FISH.</NOTE> pike, perch, trout, a few roach, and abundance of eels; and &s;hoals of that <HI>Alpine</HI> fi&s;h, the <HI>Gwyniaid,</HI> which &s;pawn in <HI>December,</HI> and are taken in great numbers in &s;pring, or &s;ummer. Pike have been caught here of twenty-five pounds weight, a trout of twenty-two, a perch of ten, and a gwyniaid of five.

<P>THE waters are di&s;charged under <HI>Pont Mwnwgl y Llyn,</HI> a bridge of three arches. They &s;eem incon&s;iderable in re&s;pect to the &s;ize of the &s;treams which feed the lake; for the <HI>Dee</HI> does not make in dry &s;ea&s;ons the figure I expected. Salmon come in plenty to this place, but neither do they tre&s;pa&s;s into the lake, and the <HI>gwyniaids</HI> very rarely into the river. Report &s;ays, that the <HI>Dee</HI> pa&s;&s;es through the lake from end to end, without deigning to mix its waters; as the <HI>Rhone</HI> was fabled to &s;erve the lake of Ge|neva.

public road, but is very apparent on both &s;ides. The mount, or keep, was on the lower, immediately above the river; and the ve&s;tiges of a wall are &s;till evident. This was &s;ub&s;ervient to the &s;ame purpo&s;es as the others; for there mu&s;t have been, from the nature of the ground, a travellable road on both &s;ides of the lake.

<P>IT was long before we got clear of the&s;e &s;uper&s;titions.

two and a half broad. Under one end was a &s;tone, three feet long; at the other, one of the length of two feet.

Around this, was a circle of &s;tones, inclo&s;ing an area of about forty paces in diameter; and the precinct might be formed with the intent of keeping people at a re&s;pectable di&s;tance from the remains, per|haps of &s;ome mighty chieftain. This monument went by the name of <HI>Karchar Kynric Rwth;</HI> not that it ever was u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e originally; but there is a tradition, that in aftertimes, a little tyrant of that name, in the neighborhood, was wont to cram tho&s;e who offended him, into the hollow of the&s;e &s;tones; which might &s;erve for the purpo&s;es of torment as well as the <HI>little ea&s;e</HI> in the tower of <HI>London,</HI> or the iron cages of the <HI>Ba&s;tille.</HI></P>
<P>THE other <HI>Ki&s;t vaen</HI> was nearly &s;imilar to the fir&s;t; but no mention is made of the circle of &s;tones: probably they were taken away before Mr. <HI>Llwyd</HI> vi&s;ited the place.</P>

Two &s;ides of the rock are precipitous. In the front of the ca&s;tle is cut a deep fo&s;s: the ca&s;tle con&s;i&s;ted of an oblong tower, rounded at the extremity; and its mea&s;ure within is forty-three feet by twenty-two.

<P>THERE is a beauty in this vale, which is not frequent in others of the&s;e mountanous countries.

But their con&s;equences to the&s;e parts are infinitely

greater, in being the beds of fuel to all the inhabitants. The turberies are placed very remote from their dwellings; and the turf, or peat, is gotten with great difficulty.

<P>THIS illu&s;trious bard informs us, that <HI>Tydecho</HI> had been an ab|bot in <HI>Armorica,</HI> and came over here in the time of king <HI>Arthur;</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="86">
but after the death of that hero, when the <HI>Saxons</HI> over-ran mo&s;t of the kingdom, the &s;aint retired, and led here a mo&s;t au&s;tere life, lying on the bare &s;tones, and wearing a &s;hirt of hair: yet he employed his time u&s;efully, was a tiller of the ground, and kept ho&s;pitality. <HI>Malgwyn Gwynedd,</HI> then a youth, took offence at the &s;aint, and &s;eized his oxen; but wild &s;tags were &s;een the next day, performing their office, and a grey wolf harrowing after them. <HI>Malgwyn,</HI> enraged at this, brought his milk-white dogs to chace the deer, while he &s;at on the blue &s;tone, to enjoy the di|ver&s;ion; but when he attempted to ri&s;e, he found his breech im|moveably fixed to the rock, &s;o that he was obliged to beg pardon of the &s;aint, who, on proper reparation, was &s;o kind as to free him from his aukward pain.</P>
<P>So far legend. That <HI>St. Tydecho</HI> might have lived, and that <HI>Malgwyn Gwynedd</HI> did live a prince of our country, I make no doubt; and that the former did receive from the prince the pri|vileges it once enjoyed, of &s;anctuary for man and bea&s;t, is equally probable: every offender, however criminal, met with protection here. Legend &s;ays, that it was to endure for a hundred ages; but, blind to futurity! the reformation was not fore&s;een.

inflicted, before and after the wars, but not during that turbulent period. Every one was to have his goods, or land, which had been forced from him, re&s;tored without law-&s;uit; and any goods detained after this, were to be deemed as &s;tolen: or if his lord &s;old them, he was fined ten pounds, and the goods, or their va|lue, to the owner. If the refractory per&s;on was hanged, or died a natural death, the demand lay good again&s;t the wife, heirs, or executors: but if they or &s;he denied the demand, the plaintiff mu&s;t procure his compurgators, viz. &s;ix per&s;ons with him, to &s;wear to the right of his clame; but (like the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in ca&s;es of jury) the defendant had a right to challenge one of the &s;ix; and another was to be provided in his &s;tead.</P>

The code concludes with valuation of &s;everal goods and chattels, for which &s;atisfaction was to be made. For example, a hor&s;e and mare, on the oath of the owner and two neighbors, were valued at ten &s;hillings; a foal at twenty pence; an ox at a mark; a cow at ten &s;hillings; the hire of an ox, and the milk of a cow, were al&s;o valued; an ewe was e&s;teemed at &s;ixteen pence, her wool at four pence, her milk at two pence, and her lamb at eight pence.</P>

The hill &s;lopes from hence upwards: the &s;teeper part to the highe&s;t peak, or the <HI>Pen yr Cader,</HI> grows more and more rocky: the approach to the &s;ummit extremely &s;o, and covered with huge fragments of di&s;co|lored rocks, very rugged, and cemented by a &s;emivitrified mat|ter, which gives them a very vulcanic look, added to their di&s;|joined, adventitious appearance. I met with, on my a&s;cent, quantities of pumice, of the &s;ame cellular kind with the <HI>toad&s;tone of Derby&s;hire,</HI> but of a green color. The day proved &s;o wet and mi&s;ty, that I lo&s;t the enjoyment of the great view from the &s;ummit. I could only &s;ee that the &s;pot I was on was a rude ag|gregate of &s;trangely di&s;ordered ma&s;&s;es. I could at intervals per|ceive a &s;tupendous precipice on one &s;ide, where the hill recedes inwards, forming a &s;ort of theatre, with a lake at the bottom; yet very high, in compari&s;on of the ba&s;e of the mountain.

The fare was &s;imple; the meal did not con&s;i&s;t of an elegant variety, but of numbers of things put together in a large di&s;h: the bread was thin oat-cakes, &s;uch as are common in our mountanous parts at this time. The family waited on the gue&s;ts, and never touched any thing till they had done, when it took up with what was left. Mu&s;ic, and the free conver&s;ation of the young women, formed the amu&s;ements of the time; for jealou&s;y was unknown among us. Bands of young men, who knew no profe&s;&s;ion but that of arms, often entered the hou&s;es, and were welcome gue&s;ts; for they were con&s;idered as the volun|tary defenders of the liberties of their country. They mixed with the female part of the family, joined their voices to the melody of the harp, and con&s;umed the day with the mo&s;t animated fe&s;ti|vity. At length, &s;unk into repo&s;e, not under rich te&s;ters, or on downy beds, but along the &s;ides of the room, on a thin covering of dried reeds, placed round the great fire, which was placed in the centre, they lay down promi&s;cuou&s;ly, covered only by a coar&s;e home-made cloth, called <HI>Brychan,</HI> or plaid, the &s;ame with the more antient <HI>Bracha;</HI> and kept one another warm, by lying clo&s;e together; or &s;hould one &s;ide lo&s;e its genial heat, they turn about, and give the chilly &s;ide to the fire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Giraldus, <HI>888.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

Pa|ri&s;hes often contend again&s;t pari&s;hes; and every hill is vocal with the chorus.</P>
<P>CONTINUE the ride, as before, between high mountains, in a narrow glen. Quit the narrow pa&s;s, and go along a good road, formed on the &s;ides of the hills, with a fine &s;lope from it to the &s;ea, at this time &s;trangely mottled with black and green, varied by the light through the broken clouds.

<P>FROM the place where I made this digre&s;&s;ion, I de&s;cended a &s;leep path through fields; and, cro&s;&s;ing the river, dined on a great &s;tone beneath the va&s;t rock <HI>Craig y Deryn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CRAIG Y DERYN.</NOTE> or <HI>The Rock of Birds,</HI> &s;o called from the numbers of corvorants, rock pigeons, and hawks, which breed on it.

<P>BEGIN a con&s;iderable a&s;cent, and find on the top &s;ome groves of hand&s;ome oaks: before me, a naked country. De&s;cend, through &s;ome &s;teep fields, to another &s;et of wooded dingles, that wind along the bottoms, and join with the former. In various parts, <HI>Cader Idris</HI> appears in full maje&s;ty over the&s;e &s;loping fore&s;ts, and gives a magnificent fini&s;hing to the pro&s;pect. Soon after my ar|rival among the woods, another ca&s;cade a&s;toni&s;hes me with its grandeur. From the &s;ituation I was in, it formed a va&s;t fall, bounded on one &s;ide by broken ledges of rocks, on the other by a lofty precipice, with trees here and there growing out of its mural front. On the &s;ummit of each part, oaks and birch form di&s;tinct little groves, and give it a &s;ort of character di&s;tinct from our other cataracts. After the water reaches the bottom of the deep concavity, it ru&s;hes in a narrow rocky cha&s;m, of a very great depth, over which is an admirable wooden <HI>Alpine</HI> bridge; and the whole, for a con&s;iderable way, awefully canopied by trees. This is called <HI>Pi&s;till y Kain,</HI> or the &s;pout of the river <HI>Kain.</HI> At no great di&s;tance from it, is another (for nature is here profu&s;e in her beauties of this kind).<NOTE PLACE="marg">PISTILL Y MAW.</NOTE> The <HI>Maw,</HI> for &s;ome &s;pace, runs along a deep glen, fini&s;hed by a bare mountain, &s;een through vi&s;tos, formed by the woods on each &s;ide.

<P>THIS road is now entirely covered with turf; but, by the ri&s;ing of it, is in mo&s;t parts very vi&s;ible: beneath are the &s;tones which

form it, and extend in all its cour&s;e, to the breadth of eight yards. There are tumuli near it, in various places, it being very u&s;ual for the <HI>Romans</HI> to inter near their highways. Clo&s;e to the part in que&s;tion is one, in which were found five urns: the whole ma|terials of it are compo&s;ed of burnt earth and &s;tones, with &s;everal fragments of bricks, which had been placed round the urns, to keep them from being cru&s;hed.</P>
<P>AFTER repo&s;ing a night at <HI>Rhiw Goch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTELL PRYSOR.</NOTE> adjacent to this part of the journey, I continued it a few miles to <HI>Ca&s;tell Pry&s;or,</HI> a very &s;ingular little fort, placed in a pa&s;s between the hills, on a natural round rock, appearing, at fir&s;t &s;ight, like the artificial mounts we had before ob&s;erved. Around its &s;ummit had been the wall, who&s;e remains are vi&s;ible in &s;everal places; and in one is the ap|pearance of a round tower: the facings are very regular, but the work de&s;titute of mortar. Notwith&s;tanding this, the ca&s;telet is probably <HI>Roman;</HI> for multitudes of coins and urns are found about it. The name explains the cau&s;e of the want of lime in the walls, <HI>Ca&s;tell Pry&s;or</HI> &s;ignifying a ca&s;tle <HI>made in ba&s;te,</HI> &s;o that there was not time to prepare the u&s;ual cement.

<P>I RETURNED out of the pari&s;h of <HI>Trawsfynnydd,</HI> along the beautiful road of the preceding day, till I reached <HI>Llan Elltyd,</HI> when I kept on the &s;ide of the hill, above the valley which leads to <HI>Barmouth.</HI> The ride is very picture&s;que; the vale wa|tered by the <HI>Maw</HI> (known here only by the name of <HI>Avon,</HI> or <HI>The River</HI>) which widens as we advanced: the &s;ides bounded by hills, chequered with woods. I found the little town of <HI>Barmouth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BARMOUTH</NOTE> &s;eated near the bottom of &s;ome high mountains, and the hou&s;es placed on the &s;teep &s;ides, one above another, in &s;uch a manner as to give the upper an opportunity of &s;eeing down the chimneys of their next &s;ubjacent neighbors. The town is &s;eated very near to the &s;ea, at the mouth of the <HI>Maw,</HI> or <HI>Mawddoch;</HI> and takes its name of <HI>Barmouth, i. e. Aber Maw,</HI> or <HI>Mawddoch,</HI> from that circum&s;tance. At high water, the tide forms here a bay, about a mile over, but the entrance hazardous, on account of the many &s;and-banks.

<P>IN a former vi&s;it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>July</HI> 18th, 1770.</NOTE> to this place, <NOTE PLACE="marg">FASTING WOMAN.</NOTE> my curio&s;ity was excited to examine into the truth of a &s;urprizing relation of a woman in the pari&s;h of <HI>Cylynin,</HI> who had fa&s;ted a mo&s;t &s;upernatural length of time. I took boat, had a mo&s;t plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age up the harbour, charmed with the beauty of the &s;hores, intermixed with woods, verdant pa&s;tures, and corn fields. I landed, and, after a &s;hort walk, found, in a farm called <HI>Tydden Bach,</HI> the object of my excur&s;ion, <HI>Mary Thomas,</HI> who was boarded here, and kept with great humanity and neatne&s;s. She was of the age of forty-&s;even, of a good countenance, very pale, thin, but not &s;o much emaciated as might be expected, from the &s;trangene&s;s of the circum&s;tances I am going to relate; her eyes weak, her voice low, deprived of the u&s;e of her lower extremi|ties, and quite bed-ridden; her pul&s;e rather &s;trong, her intel|lects clear and &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>ON examining her, &s;he informed me, that at the age of &s;even, &s;he had &s;ome eruptions like the mea&s;les, which grew confluent and univer&s;al; and &s;he became &s;o fore, that &s;he could not bear the left touch: &s;he received &s;ome ea&s;e by the appli|cation of a &s;heep's &s;kin, ju&s;t taken from the animal. After this, &s;he was &s;eized, at &s;pring and fall, with &s;wellings and in|flammations, during which time &s;he was confined to her bed; but in the intervals could walk about; and once went to <HI>Holywell,</HI> in hopes of cure.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="112">WHEN &s;he was about twenty-&s;even years of age, &s;he was at|tacked with the &s;ame complaint, but in a more violent man|ner; and during two years and a half, remained in&s;en&s;ible, and took no manner of nouri&s;hment, notwith&s;tanding her friends forced open her mouth with a &s;poon, to get &s;omething down; but the moment the &s;poon was taken away, her teeth met, and clo&s;ed with va&s;t &s;napping and violence: during that time, &s;he flung up va&s;t quantities of blood.</P>
<P>SHE well remembers the return of her &s;en&s;es, and her know|lege of every body about her. She thought &s;he had &s;lept but a night, and a&s;ked her mother whether &s;he had given her any thing the day before, for &s;he found her&s;elf very hungry. Meat was brought to her; but &s;o far from being able to take any thing &s;olid, &s;he could &s;carcely &s;wallow a &s;poonful of thin whey. From this, &s;he continued &s;even years and a half without any food or liquid, excepting &s;ufficient of the latter to moi&s;ten her lips. At the end of this period, &s;he again fancied her&s;elf hungry, and de&s;ired an egg; of which &s;he got down the quan|tity of a nut kernel. About this time, &s;he reque&s;ted to receive the &s;acrament; which &s;he did, by having a crum of bread &s;teeped in the wine. After this, &s;he takes for her daily &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence a bit of bread, weighing about two penny-weights &s;even grains, and drinks a wine gla&s;s of water: &s;ometimes a &s;poonful of wine, but frequently ab&s;tains whole days from food and liquids. She &s;leeps very indifferently: the ordinary func|tions of nature are very &s;mall, and very &s;eldom performed. Her attendant told me, that her di&s;po&s;ition of mind was mild; her temper even; that &s;he was very religious, and very &s;ervent
<PB N="107" REF="113">
in prayer: the natural effect of the &s;tate of her body, long un|embarra&s;&s;ed with the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of food, and a con&s;tant aliena|tion of thought from all worldly affairs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She was living in 1780, and in the &s;ame &s;tate.</NOTE>.</P>

She drank a pint of tea daily; and once in three or four days chewed, without &s;wallowing, a few rai&s;ins of the &s;un and blanched almonds, about four or half a dozen of each: &s;he &s;eldom eat oftener than once a month, and then only a bit of dry bread, of the &s;ize of a nutmeg; but frequently ab&s;tained from food for many weeks together.

<P>THE <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> had &s;everal animals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT HUNTING.</NOTE> which were the objects of the chace; &s;uch as, <HI>y Carw,</HI> or the &s;tag; <HI>Kaid Wenyn,</HI> a &s;warm of bees; and <HI>y Glei&s;iad,</HI> or the &s;almon. <HI>Yr Arth,</HI> the bear; <HI>y Dringhedydd,</HI> climbing animals, I &s;uppo&s;e wild cats, martins, and &s;quirrels; and <HI>Ceiliog Coed,</HI> or cock of the wood.

<P>THE three fir&s;t were <HI>Helfa Gyffredyn,</HI> or the common hunt. The &s;tag, becau&s;e he was the noble&s;t animal of chace; and be|cau&s;e every body, who came by at his death, before he was &s;kinned, might clame a &s;hare in him. The next animals were, <HI>Helfa Gyfarthfa,</HI> or the animals which could be brought to bay, &s;uch as the bear, &amp;c. which were hunted with hounds till they a&s;cended a tree. The bird mentioned here, is the cock of the wood, who&s;e nature it is to &s;it perched on a bough, where they will gaze till they are &s;hot, as they were, in old times, by the bow, or cro&s;s-bow.</P>
<P>THE third divi&s;ion was <HI>Helfa Ddolef,</HI> or the &s;houting chace, becau&s;e attended by the clamor of the &s;port&s;men; and compre|hended the fox, the hare, and the roe. The method of hunting was either with hounds, or grehounds, which they let &s;lip at the animals, holding the dogs in lea&s;hes. No one was to &s;lip his grehound when the hounds were in chace, unle&s;s he had a hound in the pack, on penalty of having the grehound ham-&s;trung: neither was it allowed to kill any animal of chace on its form, or at re&s;t, on pain of forfeiting his bow and arrow to the lord of the manor. When &s;everal grehounds, the property of different per&s;ons, were &s;lipt at any animal, the per&s;on who&s;e dog was neare&s;t the bea&s;t, when la&s;t in &s;ight, clamed the &s;kin.

<P>THE antient <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> held the fle&s;h of the &s;tag, hare, wild boar, and the bear, to be the greate&s;t delicacies among the bea&s;ts of chace.</P>
<P>THE prince had his <HI>Pencynwydd,</HI> or chief hunt&s;man. He was the tenth officer of the court. He had for his own &s;upper one di&s;h of meat; and after it, three horns of mead, one from the king, another from the queen, the third from the &s;teward of the hou&s;hold. He was never to &s;wear, but by his horn and his lea&s;h. He had the third of the fines and heriots of all the other hunt&s;men; and likewi&s;e the &s;ame &s;hare of the <HI>amobr,</HI> on the marriage of any of their daughters. At a certain time of the year, he was to hunt for the king only: at other &s;ea&s;ons, he was permitted to hunt for him&s;elf. His horn was that of an ox, of a pound value. He had in winter an ox's hide, to make lea&s;hes; in &s;ummer, a cow's, to cut into &s;patterda&s;hes.</P>
<P>THE king had liberty of hunting where&s;oever he plea&s;ed; but if a bea&s;t was hunted and killed on any gentleman's e&s;tate, and not followed and clamed by the hunt&s;man that night, the owner of the land might convert it to his own u&s;e, but was to take good care of the dogs, and pre&s;erve the &s;kin.</P>

<P>AFTER a &s;hort ride, reach the village and chapel of <HI>Maen Twrog,</HI> dependent on the church of <HI>Fe&s;tiniog,</HI> Near one end is a great upright &s;tone, from which it takes the name. This &s;tone is taken into the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> calendar, canonized by the name of <HI>St. Twrog.</HI> The place lies in the <HI>Tempe</HI> of this country, the vale of <HI>Tan y Bwlch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TAN Y BWLCH.</NOTE> a narrow, but beautiful tract, about three or four miles long, divided by the &s;mall river <HI>Dwy'ryd,</HI> or <HI>The Two Fords,</HI> being formed by the <HI>Cyn&s;ael</HI> and another &s;tream, which unite towards the upper ends. The vale is compo&s;ed of rich meadows; the &s;ides edged with groves; and barren preci|pitous mountains clo&s;e this gem, as it were, in a rugged ca&s;e. Here is a very neat &s;mall inn, for the reception of travellers, who ought to think them&s;elves much indebted to a nobleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pre&s;ent earl of <HI>Radnor.</HI></NOTE>, for the great improvement it received from his munificence.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="135">ABOVE it is a hou&s;e, embo&s;omed with woods, mo&s;t charmingly &s;ituated on the &s;ide of the hill. This &s;eat, from the quick &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of owners by the fatal attachment to the bottle, has oc|ca&s;ioned many a moral reflection from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> traveller. <Q>A heavy glutinous ale has charms enough to debauch the &s;en&s;es of the whole principality;</Q> and, let me add, after a certain &s;tage, the fiery dram is called in, to effect the de&s;truction the former had begun; yet I tru&s;t that its charms do not fa&s;ci|nate the &s;en&s;es of the WHOLE principality; but that, after a fair &s;crutiny, there may be found &s;ome corner free from the <HI>Baccha|nalian</HI> rout.</P>
<P>THE river hereabouts widens into a good &s;almon fi&s;hery; and, after &s;ome &s;pace, falls into an arm of the &s;ea, called <HI>Traeth Bach,</HI> or the little &s;ands.</P>
<P>RIDE up the vale, and di&s;mounting, meet the cour&s;e of the <HI>Cynfael,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FALLS OF THE CYNFAEL.</NOTE> which tumbles along the bottom of a deep time-worn cha&s;m, &s;ided with &s;harp and rugged rocks for a very con&s;iderable &s;pace, darkened by trees that over&s;pread the whole, i&s;&s;uing both from the &s;ides and margin. Near <HI>Fe&s;tiniog</HI> is one ca&s;cade, re|markably fine, con&s;i&s;ting of three great falls, the lowe&s;t dropping into a deep pool, black, and over-&s;hadowed by far impending rocks.

Oppo&s;ite to it lies <HI>Cwm Cwm~orthin;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CWM~ORTHIN.</NOTE> a retreat much more &s;eque&s;|tered, and much more difficult of acce&s;s, than even <HI>Cwm-bychan.</HI> In my vi&s;it to it, I de&s;cended through woods, along a &s;teep road, into a very deep, but narrow valley, which I cro&s;&s;ed, and began a very hazardous and fatiguing a&s;cent up the rocky front of a lo&s;ty mountain: the path narrow and dangerous, and, I be|lieve, very rarely attempted by hor&s;es. After the labor of a mile, reached this &s;trange habitation of two farmers, in a hollow &s;urrounded on three parts by the rude&s;t of environs, and con|taining a pretty lake, and two tenements, which yield only gra&s;s; &s;o that, in ca&s;e the inhabitants have any other wants, they mu&s;t de&s;cend from their <HI>Cwm</HI> to get them &s;upplied. The mountains which inclo&s;e it, are the <HI>Moel-wyn yr Hydd,</HI> and the <HI>Moel-wyn Gwyn,</HI> and others equally rude. High in the fir&s;t is the lake <HI>Du-bach,</HI> which affords perch; and another, called <HI>Llyn Trw&s;tyl|lon;</HI> and oppo&s;ite to the la&s;t, a third, called <HI>Llyn Conglog;</HI> all of which, after hard rains, form noble cataracts down the fronts of the hills. We preferred another way out of this &s;ingular place, and wound up a narrow path at the farthe&s;t end, on part of <HI>Molwyn y Hydd,</HI> in order to de&s;cend through <HI>Cwm Croe&s;or;</HI> being then de&s;irous of getting by the neare&s;t road to <HI>Pont Aber Gl&acirc;s Llyn.</HI> But in our de&s;cent we met with &s;uch narrowne&s;s of path, &s;uch &s;hort turnings, and horrible precipices, that our poor bea&s;ts, with much rea&s;on, trembled in every limb; and, in fact, had a wonderful e&s;cape in getting &s;afe to the bottom.

pretty wood, and &s;oon after find him&s;elf on the high road from <HI>Tan y Bwlch</HI> to <HI>Caernarvon.</HI></P>
<P>IN this journey, I went from <HI>Fe&s;tiniog</HI> on a le&s;s hazardous way. Not two miles from thence, on the road from <HI>Trawsfyn|nydd</HI> to <HI>Y&s;pytty,</HI> I fell again into <HI>Fford Helen,</HI> which is here quite bare, and exhibits the rude &s;tones with which it was made.</P>
<P>NEAR it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEDDAU GWYR ARDUDWY.</NOTE> at <HI>Rhyd yr Halen,</HI> on the right, are the remains of <HI>Beddau Gwyr Ardudwy,</HI> or the graves of the men of <HI>Ardudwy.</HI> The&s;e graves were about &s;ix feet long, marked at each end by two upright &s;tones; but mo&s;t of the &s;tones are now removed. There are yet to be &s;een &s;everal circles of &s;tones, the large&s;t about fifty-two feet in diameter; a va&s;t carnedd, with two up|right &s;tones placed on one part, as if to mark the entrance to the cell, which it probably inclo&s;es; and near it a le&s;&s;er heap, and a &s;mall circle; all of which had been &s;urrounded with a larger circle, now incomplete by the application of the materials to the making of walls. The tradition relating to the&s;e monuments, is cla&s;&s;ical; nearly parallel with the rape of the <HI>Sabines.</HI> The men of <HI>Ardudwy,</HI> to populate their country, made an inroad into the vale of <HI>Clwyd,</HI> and layed violent hands on the fair ladies of the land: they carried them in &s;afety to this place, where they were overtaken by the warriors of the vale: a fierce battle en&s;ued, and the men of <HI>Ardudwy</HI> all &s;lain; but the ravi&s;hers had &s;ome how or other &s;o gained the hearts of their fair prey, that, on their defeat, the ladies, rather than return home, ru&s;hed into an adja|cent water, called, from the event, <HI>Llyn y Morwynion,</HI> or <HI>The Maiden's Lake,</HI> and there peri&s;hed. That this had been the
<PB N="131" REF="138">
&s;cene of a bloody conflict, there is a probability: the graves and carnedds prove it; and the circles evince, that it was in the time when the ceremonies of druidi&s;m exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>FROM hence I de&s;cended the long and tedious &s;teep of <HI>Bwlch Carreg y Fr&acirc;n,</HI> into the narrow vale of <HI>Penmachno;</HI> and, after a&s;cending another hill, turn to the right into the black and moory mountains, to vi&s;it <HI>Llyn Conwy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLYN CONWY.</NOTE> the &s;ource of the noted river of that name. It is a very large piece of water, mo&s;t di&s;mally &s;i|tuated among rock and bog, and the &s;ides very irregularly in|dented. It is placed the highe&s;t of any large piece of water I have met with in the&s;e parts. In it are three i&s;lands, one of which is the haunt of the black-back Gulls, during the breeding &s;ea&s;on. They are &s;o exceedingly fierce in the defence of their young, that I knew of a man who was nearly drowned, in an at|tempt to &s;wim to their ne&s;ts, being &s;o violently beaten by the old birds, that he thought he e&s;caped well, with the dreadful brui&s;es he received on all the upper part of his body. The water i&s;&s;ues out of the end of the lake, in form of a little rill; but in the cour&s;e of a few miles, before it reaches <HI>Llanrw&s;t,</HI> becomes a mo&s;t: con&s;iderable river, by the addition of the various mountain &s;treams.</P>
<P>DESCEND for two or three miles, and reach the village of <HI>Y&s;pytty Jevan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">YSPYTTY.</NOTE> or the ho&s;pital of <HI>St. John</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> &s;o &s;tyled from its having formed, in the then inho&s;pitable country, an a&s;ylum and guard for travellers, under the protection of the knights who held the manor, and made its precincts a &s;anctuary.

<PB N="151" REF="163">to our boa&s;ted <HI>Alps.</HI> The boundaries of this vale are, on one &s;ide, the ba&s;e of the crooked mountain, <HI>Moel Siabod;</HI> on the other, that of the <HI>Gludar Bach,</HI> and &s;everal other hills of le&s;&s;er note. The bottom is meadowy; at this time enlivened with the bu&s;y work of hay harve&s;t, and filled with drags, hor&s;es, and even men and women, loaden with hay. The middle is varied with two &s;mall lakes, along who&s;e &s;ides we rode; and at &s;ome di&s;tance beyond them, near <HI>Pont y Gwryd,</HI> quitted our hor&s;es, to vi&s;it the &s;ummit of the <HI>Glyder,</HI> noted for the report the editor of <HI>Cambden</HI> had made, of the &s;ingular di&s;po&s;ition of the rocks. We directed our &s;ervants to go on to <HI>Llanberis,</HI> with our &s;teeds. The a&s;cent was extremely long, &s;teep, and laborious, wet and &s;lippery; and almo&s;t the whole way covered with loo&s;e fragments of rocks, be|neath which was a continual roar of waters, &s;eeking their way to the bottom.</P>
<P>OUR pains were fully repaid, on attaining the &s;ummit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">GLYDER BACH.</NOTE> The area was covered with groupes of columnar &s;tones, of va&s;t &s;ize, from ten to thirty feet long, lying in all directions: mo&s;t of them were of a columnar form, often piled on one another: in other places, half erect, &s;loping down, and &s;upported by others, which lie without any order at their ba&s;es. The tops are frequently crowned in the &s;trange&s;t manner with other &s;tones, lying on them horizontally. One was about twenty-five feet long, and &s;ix broad: I climbed up, and, on &s;tamping it with my foot, felt a &s;trong tremulous motion from end to end. Another, eleven feet long, and &s;ix in circumference in the thinne&s;t part, was poi&s;ed &s;o nicely on the point of a rock, that, to appearance, the touch of
<PB N="152" REF="164">
a child would over&s;et it. A third enormous ma&s;s had the pro|perty of a rocking &s;tone.</P>
<P>MANY of the &s;tones had, bedded in them, &s;hells; and in their neighborhood I found &s;everal pieces of lava. I would therefore rather con&s;ider this mountain to have been a &s;ort of wreck of nature, formed and flung up by &s;ome mighty internal convul&s;ion, which has given the&s;e va&s;t groupes of &s;tones fortuitou&s;ly &s;uch a &s;trange di&s;po&s;ition; for had they been the &s;ettled &s;trata, bared of their earth by a long &s;eries of rains, they would have retained the regular appearance, as we ob&s;erve in all other beds of &s;imilar matter.</P>
<P>ONE &s;ide of this mountain is formed into a gap, <HI>beri&s;&s;ce,</HI> I may call it, with &s;harp rocks, pointing upwards, one above the other, to a great height. In the mid&s;t of a vale far below, ri&s;es the &s;in|gular mountain <HI>Trevaen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TREVAEN.</NOTE> a&s;&s;uming on this &s;ide a pyramidal form, naked, and very rugged. A precipice, from who&s;e &s;ummit I &s;urveyed the &s;trange &s;cene, forbad my approach to examine the nature of its compo&s;ition; and whether it might not have been &s;u&s;pected of being formed at the &s;ame time with the phoenomena on the top of its neighbor <HI>Glyder:</HI> for I have heard that in&s;u|lated mountains of this form often appear at the ba&s;e of greater, which have been &s;uppo&s;ed to owe their origin to volcanic force.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Glyder Bach</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed over a plain, above half a mile broad, called <HI>Y Waun Oer, The Chilly Mountainous Flat.</HI> Ob|&s;erve from the edge, in a tremendous hollow, <HI>Llyn y Boch Llwyd,</HI> or <HI>The Lake of the Grey Goat;</HI> and in the bottom of the valley,
<PB N="153" REF="165">
near the foot of the <HI>Trevaen, Llyn Ogwen,</HI> noted for its fine trout.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Waen Oer</HI> we made a mo&s;t hazardous de&s;cent to <HI>Cwm Bochllwyd,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Llyn Ogwen.</HI> The way from that place into the valley, or rather cha&s;m, of <HI>Nant Frankon,</HI> is called <HI>The Ben-glog,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BEN-GLOG.</NOTE> the most dreadful hor&s;e path in <HI>Wales,</HI> worked in the rude&s;t manner into &s;teps, for a great length. On one &s;ide, in a deep hollow, formed under fallen rocks, was once the hiding place of <HI>Rys Goch o'r Eryri,</HI> or <HI>Rhys the Red,</HI> of <HI>Snowdon;</HI> a mountain bard, patroni&s;ed by <HI>Robert Meredydd,</HI> a partizan of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> an outlawed chieftain, of who&s;e fortunes he partook.I do a&s;&s;ure the traveller, who delights in wild na|ture, that a vi&s;it to it up <HI>Nant Frankon,</HI> from <HI>Bangor,</HI> will not be repented. The waters of five lakes dart down the precipice of the middle of the <HI>Benglog,</HI> and form the torrent of the <HI>Ogwen,</HI> which falls into the &s;ea a few miles lower. This bottom is &s;ur|rounded with mountains of a &s;tupendous height, mo&s;tly preci|pitous; the tops of many edged with pointed rocks, I have, from the depth beneath, &s;een the &s;hepherds &s;kipping from peak to peak; but the point of contact was &s;o &s;mall, that from this di&s;tance they &s;eemed to my uplifted eyes like beings of another order, floating in the air.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Trevaen,</HI> from this bottom, makes al&s;o a very &s;ingular ap|pearance, re&s;embling a human face, reclined backward. Fore|head, no&s;e, lips, and chin, are very apparent; and you may add, without any great &s;train of fancy, the beard of an antient inha|bitant, an arch-druid.</P>

It is &s;trait, and of nearly an equal breadth, filled by &s;ome meadows, and two magnificent lakes, which communicate to each other by means of a river. The venerable oaks, &s;poken of by <HI>Leland,</HI> are no more. Ava|rice, or di&s;&s;ipation, and its con&s;tant follower, poverty, have de|&s;poiled much of our principality of its leafy beauties. Among the numberle&s;s errors of this performance, I fear the word is cloathed with trees, mu&s;t be &s;upplied by the traveller with WAS. But this &s;hadele&s;s tract is &s;till worthy his attention. A road, once a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of rude and &s;tony &s;tairs, made with much la|bor, ran on one &s;ide, high above the lake, and was often cut out of the rock, to form the way. This is, I am now informed, changed into a road, which too much facilitates the approach, and le&s;&s;ens its propriety, and its agreement with the wild en|virons.</P>
<P>ON the loftie&s;t part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTELL DOLBA|DERN.</NOTE> over one of the lakes, &s;tand the remains of <HI>Ca&s;tell Dolbadern,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of a round tower, and a few frag|ments of walls. It was con&s;tructed with the thin laminated &s;tones of the country, cemented with very &s;trong mortar, with|out &s;hells. The inner diameter of the tower is only twenty-&s;ix feet. This &s;eems to have been built to defend the pa&s;s into the interior parts of <HI>Snowdonia;</HI> and it was likewi&s;e u&s;ed as a &s;tate pri&s;on.

<P>IN this valley are two groupes of wretched hou&s;es. The farthe&s;t is near the end of the upper lake, with its church, dedi|cated to <HI>St. Peris,</HI> who was, as we are told, a cardinal. Here

<P>FROM hence I took a ride above the lakes, to their lower ex|tremity. The upper is the le&s;&s;er, but much the mo&s;t beautiful piece of water. It is &s;aid to be in places a hundred and forty yards deep; to have abounded with char, before they were re|duced by the &s;treams flowing from the copper mines, which had been worked on the &s;ides of the hills. The lower lake is about a mile and a half long, narrows gradually into the form of a river, called the <HI>Rythell,</HI> and flows in a diffu&s;ed channel to <HI>Caer|narvon,</HI> where it a&s;&s;umes the name of <HI>Seiont.</HI></P>
<P>NEAR this end of the lake lived a celebrated per&s;onage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MARGARET UCH EVAN.</NOTE> whom I was di&s;appointed in not finding at home. This was <HI>Margaret uch Evan,</HI> of <HI>Penllyn,</HI> the la&s;t &s;pecimen of the &s;trength and &s;pirit of the antient <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> fair. This extraordinary female was the greate&s;t hunter, &s;hooter, and fi&s;her of her time. She kept a dozen at le&s;t of dogs, terriers, grehounds, and &s;paniels, all excel|lent in their kinds. She killed more foxes in one year, than all the confederate hunts do in ten: rowed &s;toutly, and was queen of the lake: fiddled excellently, and knew all our old mu&s;ic: did not neglect the mechanic arts, for &s;he was a very good joiner: and notwith&s;tanding &s;he was &s;eventy years of age, was the be&s;t wre&s;tler in the country, and few young men dared to try a fall with her. Some years ago, &s;he had a maid of con|genial qualities; but death, that mighty hunter, at la&s;t earthed this faithful companion of her's. I mu&s;t not forget, that all the
<PB N="159" REF="172">
neighboring bards payed their addre&s;&s;es to <HI>Margaret,</HI> and cele|brated her exploits in pure <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> ver&s;e.</P>
<P>ABOUT half a mile farther, I vi&s;ited the remains of <HI>Ll&ycirc;s Di|norwig,</HI> a hou&s;e &s;aid to have been one of the palaces of prince <HI>Llewelyn ap Gryffydd:</HI> the walls high and &s;trong; the hall twenty-four yards long; and before the hou&s;e is a deep ditch, over which had probably been a draw-bridge. Not very far from hence is a &s;pot, called <HI>Rhiw'r Cyrn,</HI> or <HI>The Brow of the Horns;</HI> where, ac|cording to old u&s;age, an officer &s;tood and blew his horn, to give notice to the hou&s;hold of the approach of their ma&s;ter, or to &s;ummon the va&s;&s;als to a&s;&s;emble on all emergent occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>THIS country is part of the woodle&s;s flat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BRITISH POSTS.</NOTE> between the moun|tains and the <HI>Menai.</HI> Its want of &s;trength is &s;upplied with &s;e|veral po&s;ts, fortified in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> manner. <HI>Dinas Dinorwig,</HI> about half a mile &s;outh of the church of <HI>Llandeniolen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the church-yard is an yew tree, twenty-&s;even feet in girth.</NOTE>, is the chief. The area is very large, &s;urrounded with an agger of &s;mall &s;tones, backed by another of very large ones: then &s;uc|ceeds a deep ditch, a rampart of earth, a &s;econd va&s;t ditch, and a third rampart: within the area is a circle of &s;tones, the po&s;t probably of the commander in chief.</P>
<P>IN our way from hence, we pa&s;&s;ed by another, called <HI>Pen y Gaer;</HI> and &s;oon after, by a &s;maller, called <HI>Bryn y Ca&s;trelau,</HI> &s;ur|rounded with a &s;ingle wall; and on a ri&s;ing on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Rythell,</HI> is another, named <HI>Caer Cwm y Glo,</HI> or <HI>Caer Carreg-y-Fran,</HI> from which had been (as we were informed) a paved way to <HI>Ll&ycirc;s Dinorwig.</HI> I may here add, that after the death of

as they reach a more exalted &s;ituation, where they want conti|nuance of &s;ummer, and the nece&s;&s;ary power of that enlivening body, to perfect their &s;eeds, become viviparous; that is, the ru|diment of the <HI>Germen</HI> vegetates, and &s;hoots into blade in the cup, from whence falling, it readily takes root, and grows; a kind and providential di&s;pen&s;ation, for the advantage of tho&s;e colder climates, which are le&s;s favorable to vegetation!</P>
<P>THIS mountanous tract &s;carcely yields any corn. Its produce is cattle and &s;heep, which, during &s;ummer, keep very high in the mountains, followed by their owners, with their families, who re&s;ide in that &s;ea&s;on in <HI>Havodtys,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SUMMER DWELLINGS.</NOTE> or &s;ummer dairy-hou&s;es, as the farmers in the <HI>Swi&s;s Alps</HI> do in their <HI>Sennes.</HI> The&s;e hou&s;es con&s;i&s;t of a long low room, with a hole at one end, to let out the &s;moke from the fire, which is made beneath. Their furniture is very &s;imple: &s;tones are the &s;ub&s;titutes of &s;tools; and the beds are of hay, ranged along the &s;ides. They manufacture their own cloaths; and dye their cloths with <HI>Cenn du y Cerrig,</HI> or <HI>Lichen Omphaloides;</HI> and another <HI>Cenn,</HI> the <HI>Lichen Parietinus;</HI> native dyes, collected from the rocks. During &s;ummer, the men pa&s;s their time either in harve&s;t work, or in tending their herds: the women in milking, or making butter and chee&s;e. For their own u&s;e, they milk both ewes and goats, and make chee&s;e of the milk, for their own con&s;umption. The diet of the&s;e mounta|neers is very plain, con&s;i&s;ting of butter, chee&s;e, and oat-bread, or <HI>Bara Cyrch:</HI> their drink whey: not but they have a re&s;erve of a few bottles of very &s;trong beer, by way of cordial, in illne&s;s.

People here u&s;ually quit their hor&s;es. We began a toil&s;ome march, clambering among the rocks. On the left were the precipices over <HI>Cwm Brwynog,</HI> with <HI>Llyn du yr Ard|dwy</HI> at their foot. On our right were tho&s;e over the &s;mall lakes <HI>Llyn Gl&acirc;s, Llyn y-Nadroedd,</HI> and <HI>Llyn Coch.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE HIGH LAKES.</NOTE> The la&s;t is the highe&s;t on this &s;ide of the mountain; and on who&s;e margins, we were told, that, in fairy days, tho&s;e diminutive gentry kept their revels. This &s;pace between precipice and precipice, forms a &s;hort, and no very agreeable i&s;thmus, till we reached a verdant expan&s;e, which gave us &s;ome re&s;pite, before we labored up ano|ther &s;eries of broken crags: after the&s;e, is a &s;econd &s;mooth tract, which reaches almost to the &s;ummit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOP OF SNOWDON.</NOTE> which, by way of pre-emi|nence, is &s;tyled Y WYDDFA, or <HI>The Con&s;picuous.</HI> It ri&s;es almo&s;t to a point, or, at be&s;t, there is but room for a circular wall of loo&s;e &s;tones, within which travellers u&s;ually take their repa&s;t.</P>
<P>THE mountain from hence &s;eems propped by four va&s;t buttre&s;&s;es; between which are four deep <HI>Cwms,</HI> or hollows: each, excepting one, had one or more lakes, lodged in its di&s;tant bot|tom The neare&s;t was <HI>F&s;ynnon L&aacute;s,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FYNNON LAS.</NOTE> or <HI>The Green Well,</HI> lying im|mediately below us. One of the company had the curio&s;ity to de&s;cend a very bad way to a jutting rock, that impended over the mon&s;trous precipice; and he &s;eemed like <HI>Mercury</HI> ready to
<PB N="163" REF="176">
take his flight from the &s;ummit of <HI>Atlas.</HI> The waters of <HI>Ffynnon L&acirc;s,</HI> from this height, appeared black and unfathomable, and the edges quite green. From thence is a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bottoms, &s;urrounded by the mo&s;t lofty and rugged hills, the greate&s;t part of who&s;e &s;ides are quite mural, and form the mo&s;t magnificent amphitheatre in nature. The <HI>Wyddfa</HI> is on one &s;ide; <HI>Crib y Di&s;till,</HI> with its &s;errated tops, on another; <HI>Crib Coch,</HI> a ridge of fiery redne&s;s, appears beneath the preceding; and oppo&s;ite to it is the boundary called the <HI>Lliwedd.</HI> Another very &s;ingular &s;up|port to this mountain is <HI>Y Clawdd Coch,</HI> ri&s;ing into a &s;harp ridge, &s;o narrow, as not to afford breadth even for a path.</P>
<P>THE view from this exalted &s;ituation is unbounded. In a former tour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Augu&s;t 25th Old Stile.</NOTE>, I &s;aw from it the county of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> the high hills of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> part of the north of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland:</HI> a plain view of the <HI>I&s;le of Man;</HI> and that of <HI>Angle&s;ea</HI> lay extended like a map beneath us, with every rill vi&s;ible. I took much pains to &s;ee this pro&s;pect to advantage; &s;at up at a farm on the we&s;t till about twelve, and walked up the whole way. The night was remarkably fine and &s;tarry: towards morn, the &s;tars faded away, and left a &s;hort interval of darkne&s;s, which was &s;oon di&s;|per&s;ed by the dawn of day. The body of the &s;un appeared mo&s;t di&s;tinct, with the rotundity of the moon, before it ro&s;e high enough to render its beams too brilliant for our &s;ight. The &s;ea which bounded the we&s;tern part was gilt by its beams, fir&s;t in &s;lender &s;treaks, at length glowed with redne&s;s. The pro&s;pect was di&s;clo&s;ed to us like the gradual drawing up of a curtain in a
<PB N="164" REF="177">
theatre. We &s;aw more and more, till the heat became &s;o power|ful, as to attract the mi&s;ts from the various lakes, which in a &s;light degree ob&s;cured the pro&s;pect. The &s;hadow of the moun|tain was flung many miles, and &s;hewed its bicapitated form; the <HI>Wyddfa</HI> making one, <HI>Crib y Di&s;till</HI> the other head. I counted this time between twenty and thirty lakes, either in this county, or <HI>Meirionydd&s;hire.</HI> The day proved &s;o exce&s;&s;ively hot, that my journey co&s;t me the &s;kin of the lower part of my face, before I reached the re&s;ting-place, after the fatigue of the morning.</P>
<P>ON this day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Augu&s;t 15th, New Stile.</NOTE>, the &s;ky was ob&s;cured very &s;oon after I got up. A va&s;t mi&s;t enveloped the whole circuit of the mountain. The pro&s;pect down was horrible. It gave an idea of numbers of aby&s;&s;es, concealed by a thick &s;moke, furiou&s;ly circulating around us. Very often a gu&s;t of wind formed an opening in the clouds, which gave a fine and di&s;tinct vi&s;to of lake and valley. Some|times they opened only in one place; at others, in many at once, exhibiting a mo&s;t &s;trange and perplexing &s;ight of water, fields, rocks, or cha&s;ms, in fifty different places. They then clo&s;ed at once, and left us involved in darkne&s;s: in a &s;mall &s;pace, they would &s;eparate again, and fly in wild eddies round the middle of the mountains, and expo&s;e, in parts, both tops and ba&s;es clear to our view. We de&s;cended from this various &s;cene with great reluctance; but before we reached our hor&s;es, a thunder &s;torm overtook us. Its rolling among the mountains was inexpre&s;&s;ibly awful: the rain uncommonly heavy. We re-mounted our hor&s;es, and gained the bottom with great hazard. The little
<PB N="165" REF="178">
rills, which on our a&s;cent trickled along the gullies on the &s;ides of the mountain, were now &s;welled into torrents; and we and our &s;teeds pa&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t ri&s;que of being &s;wept away by the&s;e &s;udden waters. At length we arrived &s;afe, yet &s;ufficiently wet and weary, to our former quarters.</P>
<P>IT is very rare that the traveller gets a proper day to a&s;cend the hill;<NOTE PLACE="marg">ATTRACTION OF CLOUDS.</NOTE> for it often appears clear, but by the evident attraction of the clouds by this lofty mountain, it becomes &s;uddenly and unexpectedly enveloped in mi&s;t, when the clouds have ju&s;t be|fore appeared very remote, and at great heights. At times, I have ob&s;erved them lower to half their height, and notwith&s;tand|ing they had been di&s;per&s;ed to the right and to the left, yet they have met from both &s;ides, and united to involve the &s;ummit in one great ob&s;&s;curity.</P>
<P>THE quantity of water which flows from the lakes of <HI>Snow|donia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVERS.</NOTE> is very con&s;iderable; &s;o much, that I doubt not but col|lectively they would exceed the waters of the <HI>Thames,</HI> before it meets the flux of the ocean.</P>

<P>THE &s;tone that compo&s;es this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">STRATA.</NOTE> and indeed the greate&s;t part of <HI>Snowdonia,</HI> is exce&s;&s;ively hard.

The antient inhabitant, the goat, decrea&s;es daily in value, &s;ince the decline of orthodoxal wigs, to which its &s;nowy hair univer&s;ally contributed.

The other circum&s;tance is con&s;tant: not that it is to be imagined that they are covered with &s;now in &s;ome part or other the whole year, as has been idly fabled; there being frequently whole weeks, even in winter, in which they are totally free.</P>
<P>THE earlie&s;t appearance of &s;now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WEATHER.</NOTE> is commonly between the middle of <HI>October,</HI> and the beginning of <HI>November:</HI> the falls which happen then, are u&s;ually wa&s;hed away with the rains, and the hills remain clear till <HI>Chri&s;tmas.</HI> Between that time and the end of <HI>January,</HI> the greate&s;t falls happen; which are &s;ucceeded

It has even happened, that the greate&s;t fall has been in <HI>April,</HI> or beginning of <HI>May;</HI> and that never fails happening, when the preceding winter has had the &s;malle&s;t falls. But the fable of <HI>Giraldus,</HI> con|cerning the continuance of &s;now the whole year, is totally to be exploded.</P>

One is &s;tyled the <HI>Cromlech,</HI> for having accidentally fallen on other &s;tones, it remains lifted from the earth, with a hollow beneath, re&s;embling one of tho&s;e <HI>Druidical</HI> antiquities.

<P>THE a&s;cent from hence is either over loo&s;e &s;tones, or &s;olid &s;tair-ca&s;e; and is exceedingly &s;teep. It is a &s;ingular road, lying in a &s;tupendous cha&s;m, bounded for above a mile by nearly equidi&s;tant precipices, of prodigious height; on one &s;ide belong|ing to the <HI>Glyders,</HI> on the other by the parts of <HI>Snowdon.</HI></P>

<P>DESCEND a very &s;teep road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CWM DYLI.</NOTE> into that part called <HI>Cwm Dyli;</HI> where we quitted our hor&s;es, and began a mo&s;t toil&s;ome journey to vi&s;it the hidden vales lodged in the bo&s;om of the mountains. We began with clambering up the rugged face of a rock, broken into a multitude of &s;hort precipices, and divided in the middle by a cataract, the di&s;charge of the waters from the <HI>Alpine</HI> lakes. After about a quarter of a mile's labor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CWM DYLI UCHA.</NOTE> we reached <HI>Cwm y Cwm Dyli,</HI> a flat tract of hay ground, watered by a river, and filled with hay-makers; the farmer and his family being re&s;ident here in his <HI>Havodtu,</HI> for the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on. After dining with them on curds and whey, we kept along the river's &s;ide, and found oppo&s;ed to us another front, rugged as the former, and attended with a cataract. This was &s;urmounted with equal difficulty. We found, on arriving at the top, a bottom a mile in length, filled with <HI>Llyn Llydaw,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLYN LLYDAW.</NOTE> a fine lake, winding beneath the rocks, and va&s;tly indented by rocky projections, here and there jutting into it. In it was one little i&s;land, the haunt of black-backed Gulls, which breed here, and, alarmed by &s;uch unexpected vi&s;i|tants, broke the &s;ilence of this &s;eque&s;tered place by their deep &s;creams. We continued our walk, a&s;cending along a narrow path above the lake, as far as the extremity; then de&s;cending, reached the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, in order to encounter a third de&s;cent, as arduous as the preceding. This brought us into the horrible <HI>crater,</HI> immediately beneath the great precipice of the <HI>Wyddfa,</HI> in which is lodged <HI>Ffynnen L&acirc;s.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FFYNNON LAS.</NOTE> Its &s;ituation is the mo&s;t dread|ful,

<P>THE margins of <HI>Ffynnon L&acirc;s</HI> here appeared to be &s;hallow and gravelly.

<P>HERE we ob&s;erved the <HI>Wheat-ear,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">WHEAT-EAR</NOTE> a &s;mall and &s;eemingly ten|der bird; and yet is almo&s;t the only &s;mall one, or indeed the only one, except the Rock Ouzel, or <HI>Mwyalchen y Graig,</HI> that frequents the&s;e heights&punc; the rea&s;on is evidently the want of food.</P>
<P>WE de&s;cended from this dreary &s;cene, on the other &s;ide of the hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CRIB COCH.</NOTE> above <HI>Llyn Llydaw,</HI> having the tremendous red preci|pices of <HI>Crib Coch</HI> high above us, ri&s;ing into a mere ridge, &s;er|rated, or rather <HI>heri&s;&s;ee,</HI> its whole length. The face of many of the rocks were marked with large veins of coar&s;e white cry&s;tal; and others, e&s;pecially <HI>Crib Coch,</HI> were varied with the deep green of the dwarf <HI>Alpine</HI> juniper. On attaining the top of the hills, above the lower end of the lake, we de&s;cend to the <HI>Gorphwysfa,</HI> where we found our hor&s;es, and returned once more into <HI>Nant-Gwinan.</HI></P>

<P>NEAR the end of the lake, the valley grows &s;o contracted, as to form only a narrow &s;treight; but almo&s;t in&s;tantly opens again into a fine expan&s;e, chiefly filled with the beautiful <HI>Llyn Di|nas.</HI> Beyond that, is a tract of meads, chequered with woods, and watered by the river created by the various lakes; but re|tains the name of <HI>Avon Gl&aacute;s-Lyn,</HI> from the lofty <HI>Ffynnon-L&acirc;s,</HI> from which it originates.</P>

is by a high rock called <HI>The Gimlet,</HI> a mile from land, to which it is joined by a range of &s;and-hills. This place was made a free borough by the <HI>Black Prince,</HI> by charter, dated in the 12th year of his principality, at <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> in compliment, to <HI>Nigel de Loryng</HI> or <HI>Lohareyn,</HI> one of the gentlemen of his bedchamber, on whom he had be&s;towed <HI>Pwllheli</HI> and <HI>Nevyn,</HI> in con&s;ideration of his great &s;ervice in <HI>Ga&s;cony,</HI> and particularly at the battle of <HI>Poitiers.</HI> He entitles him to <HI>Servitiis quorum|cunque tenentium tam liberorum quam nativorum;</HI> by which it may be pre&s;umed that he did not include the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> in the privileges.

<P>FROM hence I took a ride about five miles inland to <HI>Carn Madryn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CARN MADRYN.</NOTE> a lofty rocky in&s;ulated hill, noted for having been a &s;trong hold of the &s;ons of <HI>Owen Gwynedd, Roderick</HI> and <HI>Mal|gwn,</HI> to whom this part of the country belonged. The bottom, &s;ides, and top, are filled with cells, oblong, oval, or circular, once thatched, or covered from the inclemency of the weather: many of them are pretty entire. The chieftains re&s;ided on the top; the country, with the cattle, in times of inva&s;ion, occu|pied the &s;ides and bottom.

<P>IN the promontory <HI>Penrhyn Du,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PENRHYN DU.</NOTE> one of the points of this bay, have been con&s;iderable adventures for lead ore; and of late years attempts to drain the mines, by means of a fire engine: but the expences proved &s;uperior to the profits.

<P>IN the church are two ailes, &s;upported by four very hand&s;ome pillars. This being the place where devotees u&s;ually took boat for <HI>Bard&s;eye</HI> i&s;land, was greatly re&s;orted to.

<P>FROM this port I once took boat for <HI>Bard&s;eye</HI> i&s;land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BARADSEYE ISLAND.</NOTE> which lies about three leagues to the we&s;t. The mariners &s;eemed tinctured with the piety of the place; for they had not rowed far, but they made a full &s;top, pulled off their hats, and offered up a &s;hort prayer. After doubling a headland, the i&s;land ap|pears full in view: we pa&s;&s;ed under the lofty mountain which forms one &s;ide. After doubling the farther end, we put into a little &s;andy creek, bounded by low rocks, as is the whole level part. On landing, I found all this tract a very fertile plain, and well cultivated, and productive of every thing which the main land affords. The abbot's hou&s;e is a large &s;tone build|ing, inhabited by &s;everal of the natives: not far from it is a &s;ingular chapel, or oratory, being a long arched edifice, with an in&s;ulated &s;tone altar near the ea&s;t end.

between it and the main land. The <HI>Saxons</HI> named it <HI>Bard&s;eye,</HI> probably from the bards who retire here, preferring &s;olitude to the company of invading foreigners.</P>

<P>WE re-embarked from the rocks on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the i&s;land to that on which we landed. Rowed through the rapid current called the <HI>Race of Bard&s;ey,</HI> between the i&s;land and the great promontory <HI>Braech y Pwll,</HI> the <HI>Canganum Promontorium</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy:</HI> part of it is called, from certain yellow &s;tones, <HI>Maem Melyn;</HI> the re&s;t is a va&s;t precipice, black and tremen|dous. After landing at <HI>Aber-daron,</HI> I rid to its &s;ummit, and found the ruins of a &s;mall church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPEL VAIR.</NOTE> called <HI>Capel Vair,</HI> the Chapel of our Lady; and I was informed, that at the foot of the pro|montory, below high-water mark, was a fountain of fre&s;h water, to which devotees were wont to de&s;cend by a circuitous and mo&s;t hazardous path, to get, at low-water, a mouthful of the &s;pring; which if they carried up &s;afe to the &s;ummit, their wi&s;h, what&s;oever it was, was to be &s;urely fulfilled. This was under the protection of our Lady, and called <HI>Ffynnon Vain.</HI> The chapel was placed here to give the &s;eamen opportunity of invoking the tutelar &s;aint for protection through this dangerous &s;ound, and I dare &s;ay, in old times, the walls were covered with votive tables. Not far from hence I pa&s;fed by the ruins of <HI>Capel Anhelog,</HI> or, the Chapel without Endowment.</P>
<P>AFTER going through a fertile bottom, a&s;cended a lofty moun|tain impending over the &s;ea, called <HI>Uwch Mynydd;</HI> on which were &s;everal circular hollows, edged with &s;tone, the tempo|rary

From hence I vi&s;ited the neighboring &s;hore, which is here low and rocky, opening into frequent little creeks, u&s;eful to the fi&s;hermen; who find in them, during the herring-fi&s;hery, a &s;afe retreat from &s;torms. Among the&s;e are, <HI>Porth Towyn, Porth Colman, Porth Gwylan,</HI> and <HI>Porth Y&s;gadan.</HI> Near the la&s;t, about thirty years ago, a rock, which towered a great height out of the &s;ea, was &s;uddenly mi&s;&s;ed, after a horrible night of thunder and lightning, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;truck down by the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s bolt. I ob&s;erved that the fields about <HI>Porth Gwylan</HI> were covered with <HI>y ddafad,</HI> or &s;amphire, which &s;heep and cattle eagerly feed on, and grow very fat.

Notwith&s;tanding the laudable example of the gentry, the country is in an unimproved &s;tate, neglected for the &s;ake of the herring-fi&s;hery. The chief produce is oats, and black cattle.

The fi&s;hermen were wont to fling them away, on account of their ugly appearance: nor was this luxury known to the gentry, till one of their &s;ervants, who was acquainted with the fi&s;h, informed them of its being an inhabitant of thefe &s;eas. The <HI>Atherine, Br. Zool.</HI> iii. No 157, is taken near <HI>Pwllbeli;</HI> and a &s;mall lob&s;ter is often found burrowing in the &s;and; but differs from the common kind only in its place of re&s;idence, and in &s;ize. The traps for lob&s;ters are made with packthread, like thief-nets, and baited with pieces of the le&s;&s;er &s;potted &s;hark, <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> iii. N^o 47.

<P>THE churches in this country are of very antient foundation. Some cau&s;e or other prevented me from &s;eeing &s;everal old in&s;criptions; a few of which I have &s;ince picked up. In the church of <HI>Llangynodol</HI> is &s;aid to be this; <HI>Hic jacet</HI> GWEN HOEDL,

His life had been profligate; the monks therefore were determined that he &s;hould not die the common death of all men, and accordingly made him peri&s;h with &s;ignal marks of the vengeance of Heaven. Fancy cannot frame a place more fit for a retreat from the knowlege of mankind, or more apt to in&s;pire one with full hopes of &s;ecurity from any pur&s;uit.

<P>JUST above the &s;ea is a high and verdant mount, natural; but the top and &s;ides worked on by art. The fir&s;t flat|ted: the &s;ides marked with eight prominent ribs from top to bottom.

<P><PB N="206" REF="224">AFTER emerging out of this chearle&s;s bottom, I found fresh and amazing matter of &s;peculation. I got into a <HI>bwlch,</HI> or hollow, between two &s;ummits of the <HI>Eifl</HI> mountains;<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE EIFL HILLS.</NOTE> a range that makes a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed figure, with the &s;ugar-loaf points, from various and di&s;tant parts of the country: they range obliquely, and &s;eparate <HI>Lleyn</HI> from the hundred of <HI>Arfon,</HI> and jut into the &s;ea near <HI>Vortigern's valley.</HI></P>
<P>ACROSS this hollow, from one &s;ummit of the <HI>Eifl</HI> to the other, extends an immen&s;e rampart of &s;tones, or perhaps the ruins of a wall, which effectually blocked up the pa&s;s. On the <HI>Eifl</HI> is the mo&s;t perfect and magnificent, as well as the mo&s;t artful, of any <HI>British</HI> po&s;t I ever beheld. It is called <HI>Tre'r Caeri,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TRE'R CAERI.</NOTE> or, the <HI>Town of the Fortre&s;&s;es.</HI> This, which was the acce&s;&s;ible &s;ide, is defended by three walls; the lowe&s;t is very imperfect, the next tolerably entire, and has in it the grand entrance. This wall in one part points upwards towards the third wall, which runs round the edges of the top of the hill: the &s;econd wall unites with the fir&s;t, which runs into a point, re|verts, and joins the highe&s;t, in a place where the hill becomes inacce&s;&s;ible. The facings on the two upper walls are very entire, e&s;pecially that of the uppermo&s;t. They are lofty, and exhibit from below a grand and exten&s;ive front. The &s;pace on the top is an irregular area; part is &s;teep, part flat: in mo&s;t parts covered with heath, giving &s;helter to a few red grou&s;e. The whole is almo&s;t filled with cells. To be &s;een with advantage, the &s;tation &s;hould be taken from the &s;ummit, about which the cells are very di&s;tinct, and di&s;po&s;ed with much art. About the middle is a &s;quare place fenced with &s;tones; a &s;ort of <HI>praetorium,</HI> &s;urrounded with two rows of cells: numbers
<PB N="207" REF="225">
are al&s;o &s;cattered about the plain, and others again are conti|guous to the wall all along the in&s;ide.</P>
<P>THE cells are mo&s;tly perfect: of various forms; round, oval, oblong, &s;quare. Some of the round were fifteen feet in dia|meter; of the oblong, thirty feet in length, with long entrances regularly faced with &s;tone. All of them, when inhabited, were well protected from the weather by roofs of thatch or &s;od.</P>
<P>THE upper wall was in many places fifteen feet high on the out&s;ide, and often &s;ixteen feet broad. It con&s;i&s;ted of two pa|rallel and contiguous parts, one higher than the other, &s;erving as a parapet to the lower, which &s;eemed to have had its walk, like that on the walls of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> There was in one place a cell in the thickne&s;s of the wall, or perhaps a &s;ally-port, in part &s;topped by the falling-in of the &s;tones.</P>
<P>I was determined to trace every &s;pecies of fortre&s;s of this nature which lay in the neighborhood. On de&s;cending from <HI>Tre'r Caeri</HI> to the &s;outh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GARY GUWCH.</NOTE> I very soon ascended <HI>Moel Garn Guwh,</HI> a hill of conic form, on the &s;ummit of which is a prodigious heap of &s;tones, &s;eemingly a &s;hapele&s;s ruin; if it was not for the appearance of certain facings of a central cell &s;till remaining, to prove that it had been a large tower, and an out-po&s;t to the preceeding place.

Ore was di&s;covered; but before any quantity could be gotten, the mines were overpowered with water. In about two years after, Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Roe</HI> and Co. of <HI>Macclesfield</HI> applied to Sir <HI>Nicholas</HI> for a lea&s;e of <HI>Penrhyn ddu</HI> mine in <HI>Caernarvon&s;hire;</HI> with which they were, much again&s;t their wills, compelled to take a lea&s;e of part of this mountain, and to carry on a level, and make a fair trial. The trial was accordingly made: ore was di&s;covered; but the expences overbalanced the profits. They continued working to great lo&s;s: and at length determined to give the affair up. They gave their agent orders for that purpo&s;e; but he, as a final attempt, divided his men into ten &s;everal com|panies, of three or four in a partner&s;hip, and let them &s;ink &s;hafts in various places, about eight hundred yeards ea&s;tward of a place called the <HI>Golden Venture,</HI> on a pre&s;umption that a &s;pring, which i&s;&s;ued from near the place, mu&s;t come from a body of mineral. His conjecture was right; for in le&s;s than two days they met with, at the depth of &s;even feet from the &s;urface, the &s;olid mineral, which proved to be that va&s;t body which has &s;ince been worked to &s;uch advantage.

ever &s;ince been ob&s;erved as a fe&s;tival by the miners. Soon after this di&s;covery, another adventure was begun by the reverend Mr. <HI>Edward Hughes,</HI> owner of part of the mountain, in right of his wife <HI>Mary Lewis</HI> of <HI>Llys Dulas;</HI> &s;o that the whole of the trea&s;ure is the property of Sir <HI>Nicholas Bayley</HI> and him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE body of copper ore is of unknown extent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE ORE.</NOTE> The thick|ne&s;s has been a&s;certained, in &s;ome places, by the driving of a level under it, &s;everal years ago, and it was found to be in &s;ome places twenty-four yards. The ore is mo&s;tly of the kind called by <HI>Cron&s;ted, Pyrites cupri flavo viride&s;cens;</HI> and contains va&s;t quantities of &s;ulphur. It varies in degrees of goodne&s;s; &s;ome of it is rich, but the greater part poor in quality.</P>
<P>THERE are other &s;pecies of copper ore found here. Of late a vein of the <HI>Pyrites cupri gri&s;eus</HI> of <HI>Cron&s;ted,</HI> about &s;even yards wide, has been di&s;covered near the we&s;t end of the mountain: &s;ome is of an iron grey, &s;ome quite black; the fir&s;t contains &s;ix|teen lb. of copper per clb. the la&s;t, forty. An ore has been lately found, in form of loo&s;e earth, of dark purpli&s;h color; and the be&s;t of it has produced better thatn eight in twenty. Some years ago, above thirty pounds of native copper was found in driving a level through a turbery; &s;ome was in form of mo&s;s, &s;ome in very thin leaves.</P>
<P>IT is quarried out of the bed in va&s;t ma&s;&s;es; is broken into &s;mall pieces; and the mo&s;t pure part is &s;old raw, at the rate of about 3<HI>l.</HI> to 6<HI>l.</HI> per ton, or &s;ent to the &s;melting-hou&s;es of the re&s;pective companies to be melted into metal. Mr. <HI>Hughes</HI> has great furnaces of his own at <HI>Ravenhead,</HI> near <HI>Leverpool,</HI> and at <HI>Swan&s;ey,</HI> in <HI>South Wales.</HI> An idea of the wealth of the&s;e mines may be formed, by con&s;idering that the <HI>Macclesfield</HI> com|pany
<PB N="268" REF="292">

<P>THE more impure ore is al&s;o broken to the &s;ize of about hen's eggs; but in order to clear it from the quantity of &s;ul|phur with which it abounds, as well as other advantitious mat|ter, it mu&s;t undergo the operation of burning. For that pur|po&s;e it is placed between two parallel walls of va&s;t length: &s;ome kilns are twenty, others forty, and fifty yards in length; &s;ome ten, others twenty feet wide, and above four feet in height. The &s;pace between is not only filled, but the ore is piled many feet higher, in a convex form, from end to end: the whole is then covered with flat &s;tones, clo&s;ely luted with clay; and above is placed a general integument of clay, and &s;mall rubbi&s;h of the work, in order to prevent any of the fumes from evaporating. Of late &s;ome kilns have been con&s;tructed with brick arches over the ore, which is found to be the be&s;t method of burning. Within the&s;e few years, attempts are made to pre|&s;erve the &s;ulphur from flying away; and that is done by flues, made of brick, who&s;e tops are in form of a Gothic arch, many &s;cores of feet in length: one end of the&s;e opens into the beds of copper which are to be burnt. Tho&s;e beds are &s;et on fire by a very &s;mall quantity of coal, for all the re&s;t is effected by its own <HI>phlogi&s;ton.</HI> The volatile part is confined, and diredted to the flues; in its cour&s;e the &s;ulphurous particles &s;trike again&s;t their roofs, and fall to the bottom in form of the fine&s;t brim&s;tone;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BRIMSTONE.</NOTE> which is collected, and carried to adjacent hou&s;es, where it is melted into what is called in the &s;hops &s;tone brim&s;tone.</P>
<P>THE beds of copper, thus piled for burning, are of va&s;t ex|tent. Some contain four hundred tons of ore, others two
<PB N="269" REF="293">
thou&s;and. The fir&s;t require four months to be completely burnt; the la&s;t, near ten. Thus burnt, it is carried to proper places to be dre&s;&s;ed, or wa&s;hed, and made merchantable. By this proce&s;s the ore is reduced to a fourth part in quantity, but con&s;iderably improved in quality: and by this means the water is &s;trongly or richly impregnated with copper, which is di&s;&s;olved by the acid quality of the &s;ulphur; and is collected or precipitated again by iron in the above-de&s;cribed pits. The iron is all di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>BUT a far richer produce of copper is di&s;covered from the water lodged in the bottom of the bed of ore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRECIPITATED COPPER.</NOTE>which is highly &s;aturated with the precious metal. This is drawn up, either by means of whim&s;ies or windmills, to the &s;urface, and then di&s;tributed into numbers of rectangular pits thirty-&s;ix feet long, &s;ome pits more &s;ome le&s;s, twelve to fifteen feet broad, and twenty inches deep. To &s;peak in the language of the adept, <HI>Venus</HI> mu&s;t make an a&s;&s;ignation with <HI>Mars,</HI> or this &s;olution will have no effect. In plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> a quantity of iron mu&s;t be immer&s;ed in the water. The kind of iron is of no moment; old pots, hoops, anchors, or any refu&s;e will &s;uffice; but of late, for the convenience of management, the adventurers procure new plates, four feet long, one and a half broad, and three quarters of an inch thick. The&s;e they immer&s;e into the pits; the particles of copper in&s;tantly are precipitated by the iron, and the iron is gradually di&s;&s;olved into a yellow ocher; great part of it floats off by the water, and &s;inks to the bottom. The plates, or the old iron (as it happens) are frequently taken out, and the copper &s;craped off; and this is repeated till the whole of the iron is con&s;umed. The copper thus procured differs
<PB N="270" REF="294">
little from native copper, and is prized accordingly, and &s;old for prices of 25<HI>l.</HI> to 45<HI>l.</HI> a ton.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;covery is far from new; it has been practi&s;ed long in the <HI>Wicklow</HI> mines in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and above a century in tho&s;e of <HI>Hern-grundt</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> where it is called <HI>Ziment Copper</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brown's travels, <HI>68.</HI> Key&s;ler's travels, <HI>iv. 70.</HI></NOTE> The waters of the <HI>Hungarian</HI> mines are much more &s;trongly impregnated with copper than tho&s;e of <HI>Parys mountain.</HI> The fir&s;t effects its operation in twelve or about twenty days; the la&s;t requires two months. Hor&s;e-&s;hoes, iron made in &s;hape of hearts, and other forms, are put into the foreign waters, and when per|fectly tran&s;muted, are given as pre&s;ents to curious &s;trangers.</P>
<P>THE ore is not got in the common manner of mining, but is cut out of the bed in the &s;ame manner as &s;tone is out of a quarry. A hollow is now formed in the &s;olid ore open to the day, and extends about and hundred yards in length, about forty yards in breadth, and twenty-four yards in depth. The ends are at pre&s;ent undermined, but &s;upported by va&s;t pillars and mignificent arches, all metallic; and the&s;e caverns meander far under ground. The&s;e will &s;oon di&s;appear, and thou&s;ands of tons of ore be gotten from both the columns and roofs. The &s;ides of this va&s;t hollow are mo&s;tly perpendicular, and acce&s;s to the bottom is only to be had by &s;mall &s;teps cut in the ore; and the curious vi&s;itor mu&s;t tru&s;t to them and a rope, till he reaches &s;ome ladders, which will conduct him the re&s;t of the de&s;cent. On the edges of the cha&s;ms are wooden platforms, which project far; on them are windla&s;&s;es, by which the work|men are lowered to tran&s;act their bu&s;ine&s;s on the face of the precipice. There &s;u&s;pended, they work in mid air, pick a
<PB N="271" REF="295">
&s;mall &s;pace for a footing, cut out the ore in va&s;t ma&s;&s;es, and tumble it to the bottom with great noi&s;e. In &s;uch &s;ituations they form caverns, and there appear &s;afely lodged, till the rope is lowered to convey them up again. Much of the ore is bla&s;ted with gunpowder, eight tons of which, I am informed, is an|nually u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>NATURE hath been profu&s;e in be&s;towing her mineral favors on this &s;pot; for above the copper ore, and not more than three quarters of a yard beneath the common &s;oil, is a bed of yellow|i&s;h grea&s;y clay, from one to four yards thick, containing lead ore, and yielding from &s;ix hundred to a thou&s;and pounds weight of lead from one ton; and one ton of the metal yields not le&s;s than fifty-&s;even ounces of &s;ilver. Mixed with the earth, are fre|quently certain parts of the color of cinnabar: whether the&s;e are &s;ymptomatic of the &s;ulphurous ar&s;enical &s;ilver ores, or of quick&s;ilver, I will not pretend to decide. Something inter|feres with the &s;ucce&s;sful &s;melting of this earth in the great: in&s;omuch that it has not yet been of that profit to the adven|turers, which might rea&s;onably be expected from the crucible a&s;&s;ays of it; and they have at this time about eight thou&s;and tons on bank undi&s;po&s;ed of. This place has been worked for lead ore in very di&s;tant times. In the bottom of the pool was found an antient &s;melting hearth of grit-&s;tone, and &s;everal bits of &s;melted lead, of about four inches in length, two breadth, and half an inch thick.</P>
<P>THESE works have added greatly to the population of the i&s;land; for about fifteen hundred per&s;ons are employed, who, with their families, are &s;uppo&s;ed to make near eight thou&s;and per&s;ons, getting their bread from the&s;e mines. The little vil|lage

The port is no more than a great cha&s;m between two rocks, running far into land, and dry at low-water; into which &s;loops run, and lie &s;ecure to receive their lading.</P>

<P>FROM <HI>Penrhyn</HI> I vi&s;ited the church of <HI>Llandegai,</HI> about a mile di&s;tant from the hou&s;e. It is finely &s;ituated on a lofty, bank above the <HI>Ogwen,</HI> and commands a beautiful view. It is a &s;mall but neat &s;tructure, in form of a cro&s;s; with the tower in the center, &s;upported within by four arches. Here is pre|&s;erved an alaba&s;ter monument of an armed man, and his lady, recumbent. They probably belonged to the neighboring hou&s;e; but on the di&s;&s;olution were removed from the friery of <HI>Llanvaes,</HI> where the per&s;ons repre&s;ented had been interred. A mural monument, with the figure of archbi&s;shop <HI>John Wil|liams</HI> in his epi&s;copal dre&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARCHBISHOP WILLIAMS.</NOTE> kneeling at an altar, is placed above the remains of that great prelate. He was born at <HI>Conwy.</HI>
<PB N="295" REF="320">
His father <HI>Edmund</HI> was &s;ixth &s;on of the neighboring family of <HI>Cwchwillan,</HI> a branch of that of <HI>Penrhyn.</HI> His mother <HI>Mary,</HI> daughter of <HI>Owen ap John Owen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pedigree of the family, MS.</NOTE>. The archbi&s;hop was fifth &s;on. In his childi&s;h years, with other play-fellows, he was di|verting him&s;elf with leaping from part of the walls of <HI>Conwy</HI> down to the &s;hore. The fall was on &s;o critical a part, as ever to &s;ecure him from all reproaches of uncha&s;tity. I mention this merely to re&s;cue him from the reflections flung on him by that &s;atyrical hi&s;torian Sir <HI>Anthony Weldon</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Memoirs.</NOTE>. At &s;chool, which was that of <HI>Ruthin,</HI> he was a compound of alternate truantry and indu&s;try. His great abilities were &s;oon taken notice of. He entered on public life as chaplain to lord chancellor <HI>Eger|ton;</HI> and preaching before the king, &s;o plea&s;ed the royal ear, that in 1610 <HI>James</HI> made him dean of <HI>Sali&s;bury;</HI> and on far|ther di&s;covery of his great abilities, in 1620, dean of <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter;</HI> and in 1621, lord keeper, in the room of the illu&s;tri|ous Lord <HI>Bacon;</HI> and in le&s;s than a month, nominated him to the &s;ee of <HI>Lincoln.</HI> Now placed above re&s;traint, his character be|gan to unfold. His &s;pirit grew beyond the controul of mini|&s;ters; for, with undaunted courage, he per&s;i&s;ted in all that was right: and, being &s;ubject to the failings of his country, (great pa&s;&s;ion, pride, and vanity) &s;ometimes in what was wrong. He di&s;charged his office, foreign as it was to his profe&s;&s;ion, with di&s;tingui&s;hed credit near five years. Soon after the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Charles</HI> I. by the influence of the favorite <HI>Buckingham,</HI> he was &s;uddenly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed: for he always had re&s;i&s;ted the un|rea&s;onable demands of that minion.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="321">IN two parts of his conduct I mu&s;t con&s;ider him as a wife but not as a good man:&mdash;His advice to his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ma&s;ter, in the ca&s;e of the earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> had too great a &s;hare of du|plicity to be vindicated; perhaps of re&s;entment, for he hated the devoted mini&s;ter. The &s;pirit of <HI>Machiavel</HI> aro&s;e &s;trong in him, when he &s;poke of a public and private con&s;cience; and &s;till more &s;trongly when he advi&s;ed <HI>Charles,</HI> in ca&s;e the king could not gain <HI>Cromwel</HI> by promi&s;es of fair treatment, to catch him by &s;ome &s;tratagem, and cut him &s;hort. He may appear in the&s;e in&s;tances a great mini&s;ter, but a bad divine. The infirmity, the inequalities, which may be met in men even of fir&s;t-rate abilities, may be exemplified in his attempt to defend him&s;elf from a frivolous accu&s;ation; for he fell into the di&s;|graceful crime of &s;ubornation of perjury, was cen&s;ured in the &s;tar-chamber, and &s;uffered impri&s;onment from 1637 to 1640. On his relea&s;e, irritated again&s;t the court, he for a time joined the popular leaders. Let me attribute this (and candor may admit the cau&s;e) to the natural violence of his temper; for on all trying occa&s;ions he &s;hewed his zeal for the liberty of the &s;ubject, and his &s;incerity to his order. Soon after this, he was, according to an old promi&s;e, promoted to the &s;ee of <HI>York.</HI> He was a firm friend to the <HI>petition of right</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Drake's Parliam. Hi&s;t. <HI>viii. 146.</HI></NOTE>, fore&s;eeing that he &s;erved both king and people in the &s;upport of it. As a friend to the church, he was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful an advocate, and &s;hewed &s;uch eloquence and &s;trength of rea&s;oning, in the debate in <HI>May</HI> 1641, on taking away the votes of bi&s;hops in the hou&s;e of lords<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame, ix, 334.</NOTE>, as to cau&s;e the affair to be dropped for that &s;e&s;&s;ions.
<PB N="297" REF="322">
In the latter end of the year, when popular fury ran high, he was attacked in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> abbey; and with great courage re|pelled the violence of the mob. This gave ri&s;e to the fir&s;t &s;atyrical political print I know. The prelate is repre&s;ented in his epi&s;copal dre&s;s, a mu&s;ket on his &s;houlder, re&s;t in his hand, helmet on his head, and mitre on the ground. The rage of the common people increa&s;ed, even &s;o far as to &s;eize him in his way to the hou&s;e of lords, and to tear his robes from his back. Incen&s;ed at this, he returned to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> abbey (the deanery of which he had been allowed to hold three years in <HI>commendam</HI>) and, in a fit of pa&s;&s;ion, induced eleven bi&s;hops to join him in a phrenetic prote&s;t again&s;t all acts that &s;hould be done in the hou&s;e of lords during their forced ab&s;ence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, <HI>ii. 350.</HI></NOTE>. This brought an impeachment of high-trea&s;on again&s;t them, impri&s;onment of eighteen months, and in the end a relea&s;e upon bail, in which the archbi&s;hop in particular was bound not to go into his dioce&s;e during the di&s;turbances in the county of <HI>York</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Drake's Parliam.

He died at <HI>Gloddaeth,</HI> the &s;eat of Sir <HI>Roger Mo&s;tyn,</HI> an eminent loyali&s;t; who&s;e lady warned him of the approach of death, the &s;troke of which he received with exemplary piety, courage, and re&s;ignation<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philips's Life of archbi&s;hop Williams,</HI> 305.

<P><PB N="302" REF="327">CONTINUE my ride towards the &s;hore, towards <HI>Aber,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ABER.</NOTE> a &s;mall village with a church, in the gift of Lord <HI>Bulkeley;</HI> &s;eated at the mouth of a deep glen, which runs &s;traight a mile and a half between the mountains, and bounded on one &s;ide by a magni|ficent rock, called <HI>Maes y Gaer.</HI> One part is hid with trees; on the other they only &s;prinkle its grey &s;urface. At the ex|tremity of this glen a mountain pre&s;ents a concave front, in the center of which a va&s;t cataract precipitates down a double fall.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASCADE.</NOTE> The lowe&s;t is of a very great height, and forms partly a broad white &s;heet, partly a &s;nowy dew, not unlike the <HI>Staub|hauch,</HI> or <HI>du&s;ty</HI> ca&s;cade, in <HI>Switzerland.</HI></P>
<P>AT the entrance of the glen, clo&s;e to the village, is a very large artificial mount, flat at top, and near &s;ixty feet in diame|ter, widening towards the ba&s;e. It was once the &s;ite of a ca&s;tle belonging to <HI>Llewelyn</HI> the Great. Some foundations are yet to be &s;een round the &s;ummit, and in digging, traces of buildings have been di&s;covered. In this place was detected the intrigue of <HI>William de Breos</HI> (&s;on of <HI>Reginald,</HI> a potent baron in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III.) with the wife of <HI>Llewelyn.</HI> It &s;eems that <HI>William,</HI> by chance of war, had before fallen into the hands of our prince, at which time probably the familiarity with the prince&s;s commenced; but was not di&s;covered till after he was relea&s;ed on a large ran&s;om<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale Baron, <HI>i. 419.</HI></NOTE>. The vindictive <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> in the following year (1229) inveigled <HI>Breos</HI> into his power, by an invitation to celebrate the fea&s;t of <HI>Ea&s;ter;</HI> when, after an elegant banquet, the prince reproached him with his crime,

<P>I CONTINUED my journey from <HI>Aber</HI> along the rich rece&s;s, en|joying a fine view of the entrance into the <HI>Menai,</HI> with its wooded &s;hores of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Prie&s;tholm</HI> i&s;le, and the great expan&s;e of water between them and <HI>Llandudno,</HI> or <HI>Orm&s;head:</HI> the va&s;t cape ri&s;ing, like the rock of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> high out of the waves. Before me &s;oared the great promontory of PENMAEN MAWR, protruding it&s;elf into the &s;ea, and exhibiting a fine contra&s;t to the fertility which it interrupts, by a rude view of grey weather-beaten &s;tone and precipice. I pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Bryn y Neuodd,</HI> a hou&s;e late the property of <HI>Humphrey Roberts,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> now of his daughter and &s;ole heire&s;s, relict of <HI>Robert Wynne,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of
<PB N="304" REF="329">
<HI>Pl&acirc;&s;newydd,</HI> near <HI>Denbigh.</HI> A little farther is the &s;mall vil|lage and church of <HI>Llanvair Vechan;</HI> from whence is a very &s;hort ride to the once tremendous road over this celebrated rock.</P>
<P>IN pa&s;t times it was ju&s;tly the terror of the traveller;<NOTE PLACE="marg">PENMAEN MAWR.</NOTE> ex|tremely narrow, bad, and &s;toney; and what added to his fears, for a con&s;iderable way the danger encrea&s;ed with his progre&s;s, by rea&s;on of the precipice gaining additional height. Generally it was without the protection of a wall to &s;ecure him in ca&s;e of a fal&s;e &s;tep; which might in the loftie&s;t place precipitate him &s;ome &s;cores of yards, either on &s;harp rocks or into the &s;ea according to the &s;tate of the tide. A vein of a crumbling &s;tratum, in one part &s;o contracted the road as to excite new hor|rors. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parlement ea&s;ed the fears of the travellers by a generous aid; which, by means of the judicious employ|ment of JOHN SYLVESTER, about the year 1772, effected what was before thought beyond the reach of art to remedy. The road is now widened to a proper breadth, and near the verge of the precipice &s;ecured by a &s;trong wall. The de&s;cent towards <HI>Penmaen Bach,</HI> or the <HI>Little Penmaen,</HI> which before was hardly practicable, is now de&s;troyed; and the road is brought on a level for two or three miles, at a va&s;t height above a return of rich &s;lopes, and the deep bottom of <HI>Dwygyfylchig,</HI> till we arrive at the rude back of that le&s;&s;er promontory; when we labor up the &s;teep a&s;cent of <HI>Sychnant,</HI> with a horrible and almo&s;t precipitous mountain on one &s;ide, and hills, with tops broken into mo&s;t &s;ingular crags, on the other. From the top of <HI>Sych|nant,</HI> the road is continued about two miles on a perpetual de&s;cent to the town of <HI>Conway.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="330">THE breach occa&s;ioned by the crumbling &s;tratum, is now effectually repaired by a &s;eries of arches; a work the ju&s;t ad|miration of travellers, and a high credit to the ingenious con|triver. One danger yet remains, which mu&s;t for ever baffle the art of man: the &s;ide of this great rock, above the road, breaks into millions of va&s;t ma&s;&s;es, depending often on preca|rious tenures; which, loo&s;ened by the frequent torrents, &s;ome|times (though rarely) de&s;cend in &s;toney &s;treams.</P>
<P>Two or three accidents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ACCIDENTS THERE.</NOTE> which have happened on this road, will remain as miracles. An exci&s;eman fell from the highe&s;t part, and e&s;caped unhurt. The reverend Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who, in 1762, was rector of <HI>Llanelian,</HI> in the i&s;le of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> fell with his hor&s;e, and a midwife behind him, down the &s;teepe&s;t part. The <HI>&s;age femme</HI> peri&s;hed, as did the nag. The divine, with great philo&s;ophy, un&s;addled the &s;teed, and marched off with the trappings, exulting at his pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I HAVE often heard of another accident, attended with &s;uch romantic circum&s;tances that I would not venture to mention it, had I not the &s;tronge&s;t traditional authority, to this day in the mouth of every one in the pari&s;h of <HI>Llanvair Vechan,</HI> in which this promontory &s;tands. Above a century ago, <HI>Si&ocirc;n Humphries</HI> of this pari&s;h had made his addre&s;&s;es to <HI>Anne Thomas</HI> of <HI>Creyd|dyn,</HI> on the other &s;ide of <HI>Conway</HI> river. They had made an appointment to meet at a fair in the town of <HI>Conway.</HI> He in his way fell over <HI>Penmaen Mawr:</HI> &s;he was over&s;et in the ferry-boat, and was the only per&s;on &s;aved out of more than four&s;core. They were married, and lived very long together in the pari&s;h of <HI>Llanvair.</HI> She was buried <HI>April</HI> 11th 1744, aged 116. He &s;urvived her five years, and was buried <HI>December</HI> 10th 1749;
<PB N="306" REF="331">
was buried clo&s;e by her in the pari&s;h church-yard, where their graves are familiarly &s;hewn to this day.</P>
<P>I HAVE more than once vi&s;ited the &s;ummit of this noted rock, to view the fortifications de&s;cribed by the editor of <HI>Cambden,</HI> from &s;ome notes of that &s;en&s;ible old baronet Sir <HI>John Wynn</HI> of <HI>Gwedir,</HI> and have found his account very ju&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cambden,</HI> ii. 804, &amp; &s;eq. Before Sir <HI>John Wynn,</HI> a Sir <HI>Thomas ap Wil|liam,</HI> medicus, M. A. had de&s;cribed it; but his account never appeared in print. He was eighth &s;on of one of the family of <HI>Cochwillan.</HI> Lived in the year 1594, and is &s;aid to have re&s;ided at <HI>Trefriw.</HI></NOTE>. The a&s;cent is laborious. Soon after leaving the inn, I met with the ruins of St. <HI>Seiriol</HI>'s chapel, or, as it is here called, his <HI>Gweli,</HI> or bed; and after pa&s;&s;ing a con&s;iderable way amid&s;t &s;mall trees and bru&s;h-wood, attain the bare and &s;toney part, or the <HI>Braich y Ddinas,</HI> (i. e. the arm of the city) which ri&s;es in form of another hill out of this promontory. A Mr. <HI>Ca&s;wel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS HEIGHT.</NOTE> at the reque&s;t of Mr. <HI>Flam&s;teed</HI> the great a&s;tronomer, mea&s;ured the height, and found it to be from the &s;ands 1545 feet.</P>
<P>AFTER climbing for &s;ome &s;pace among the loo&s;e &s;tones, the front of three, if not four,<NOTE PLACE="marg">AN ANTIENT FORTRESS.</NOTE> walls pre&s;ented them&s;elves very di&s;|tinctly one above the other. In most places the facings ap|peared very perfect; but all of dry work. I mea&s;ured the height of one wall, which was at the time nine feet; the thickne&s;s &s;even feet and a half. Between the&s;e walls, in all parts, were innumerable &s;mall buildings, mo&s;tly circular, and regularly faced within and without; but not di&s;po&s;ed in any certain order. The&s;e had been much higher, as is evident from the fall of &s;tones, which lie &s;cattered at their bottoms; and
<PB N="307" REF="332">
probably had once the form of towers, as Sir <HI>John</HI> a&s;&s;erts. Their diameter in general is from twelve to eighteen feet; but &s;ome were far le&s;s, not exceeding five feet. The walls were in certain places inter&s;ected with others equally &s;trong. On the north-we&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ides are the plain marks of two roads, of a zig-zag form, with the remains of walls on both &s;ides, which lead to the &s;ummit. On the &s;mall area of the top had been a group of towers, or cells, like the former; one in the center, and five others &s;urrounding it. Three are &s;till di&s;tinct; of the two others are only faint ve&s;tiges. Near this had been, I believe, a &s;imilar group; but at pre&s;ent reduced to a &s;hape|le&s;s heap of &s;tones. Near one of the&s;e groups is a well cut in the live rock, and always filled with water, &s;upplied by the rains, and kept full by the frequent impending vapours.</P>
<P>THIS &s;trong hold of the <HI>Britons</HI> is exactly of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e on <HI>Carn Madryn, Carn Boduan,</HI> and <HI>Tre'r Caeri,</HI> de|&s;cribed pp. 194. 206. 207. This was mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly founded, to cover the pa&s;&s;age into <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> and the remoter part of their country; and mu&s;t, from its va&s;t &s;trength, have been invincible, except by famine; being inacce&s;&s;ible by natural &s;teepne&s;s to|wards the &s;ea, and on the other parts fortified in the manner de&s;cribed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a plan of the top and one &s;ide of this &s;trong hold in the <HI>Archaelogia,</HI> iii. plate xxix. p. 352.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE white beam, or <HI>Aria Theophra&s;ti,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ARIA THEO|PHRASTI.</NOTE> is frequent on the &s;ides of this rock, and in many &s;imilar places in <HI>Wales.</HI> No u&s;e is made of it in our country. The <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> procure from the berries a good &s;pirit. The wood is very hard, and excellent for
<PB N="308" REF="333">
flutes: and the wood, from its great &s;olidity, was e&s;teemed to make the be&s;t charcoal.</P>
<P>I DESCENDED from the &s;ummit into a hollow between the <HI>Penmaen</HI> and an adjacent mountain. Got upon my hor&s;e, and directed my cour&s;e on a good &s;heep-walk towards <HI>Conway.</HI> In my way ob&s;erved, above <HI>Gwdhw Gl&acirc;s,</HI> in the pari&s;h of <HI>Dwygy|vylcheu,</HI> a long &s;eries of antiquities, &s;ome of which are men|tioned in the account of <HI>Penmaen Mawr</HI> pre&s;erved in <HI>Cambden.</HI> For a very con&s;iderable length of way I &s;aw circles of &s;tones of various diameters, and great <HI>Carneddau.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CIRCLES AND CARNEDDAU.</NOTE> The principal circle con&s;i&s;ts at pre&s;ent of ten upright &s;tones, at unequal di&s;|tances from each other; the large&s;t of which is eight feet three inches high: on the ground is another, eleven feet two. The circle is completed by a low bank of loo&s;e &s;tones placed be|tween the greater. The diameter of this circle is eighty feet. Near this are four other circles, far inferior in &s;ize. In the cen|ter of one is a flat &s;tone, the remains of a Cromlech; pro|bably the re&s;t might have had tho&s;e memorials before they were removed for the purpo&s;e of walling, or the like. About a quarter of a mile from the&s;e is a large <HI>Carnedd,</HI> compo&s;ed of &s;mall &s;tones, and near it another of large &s;tones; and not far from the&s;e, a circle compo&s;ed of &s;mall ones<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An a&s;&s;emblage of antiquities of this nature may be &s;een in plate ii. book iii. of Mr. THOMAS WRIGHT'S <HI>Louthirna.</HI> That book is a &s;mall &s;pecimen of his great abilities.

Near the la&s;t is a great rude &s;tone &s;tanding upright, called <HI>Maen y Campiau,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MAEN Y CAMPIAU.</NOTE>
<PB N="309" REF="334">
or <HI>Stone of the Games;</HI> and almo&s;t contiguous is a Carnedd, and a &s;mall circle of twelve &s;tones. This tract had certainly been much inhabited; for all around are the foundations of &s;mall buildings, made of rounded &s;tones, &s;uitable to the rudene&s;s and &s;implicity of di&s;tant ages. Small upright &s;tones, and numbers of &s;mall <HI>Carnedds,</HI> are &s;cattered in various places; and the ve&s;|tige of a formed road is to be &s;een pointing from hence towards the <HI>Conway.</HI></P>
<P>WHATSOEVER purpo&s;e the le&s;&s;er circles might be de&s;igned for, there is great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the greater, e&s;pecially that near to the <HI>Maen y Campiau,</HI> were the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> circus for the exhibition of antient games; probably the <HI>Ei&s;teddfods,</HI> or &s;e&s;&s;ions for deciding the merits of rivals in our <HI>Briti&s;h Olympics,</HI> might have been originally held here, or in &s;imilar places. Of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> games,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE ANTIENT GAMES.</NOTE> we had twenty-four, <HI>Pedair</HI> CAMP <HI>ar hugain,</HI> who&s;e names, as pre&s;erved by Dr. <HI>Davies</HI> in his Dictionary, I &s;hall give, with their explanation, as far as in my power. Of the&s;e, ten were called GWROLGAMPAU, or manly games; of the&s;e, &s;ix depended on bodily &s;trength alone, and were &s;tyled <HI>Tadogion,</HI> i. e. <HI>Father games,</HI> becau&s;e no in&s;trument what&s;oever was nece&s;&s;ary to perform them: for they depended on the man, naked as he was born. The <HI>Greeks</HI> had their <HI>Pentathlum.</HI> We had one more. I. Strength to rai&s;e weights; II. Running; III. Leaping; IV. Swimming; V. Wre&s;tling; VI. Riding. I imagine that the word <HI>Marchogaeth</HI> extends farther than the common acceptation, and that the game intended was a con|te&s;t between charioteers; for no people were more &s;killed in the u&s;e of chariots in war than the <HI>Britons:</HI> it is therefore impro|bable that they would not, in time of peace, exert their art in
<PB N="310" REF="335">
mimic combat, or in competitions of &s;peed in the fe&s;tive field. And the&s;e &s;ix were undoubtedly original games of this i&s;land, and from the earlie&s;t of times: of others, &s;ome doubt may be made.</P>
<P>THE remaining four manly games were, <HI>O Rym-arfau,</HI> or what depended on &s;kill in arms. I. Archery; II. Playing with the &s;word and buckler; III. Playing with the <HI>Cleddyf Deuddwrn,</HI> or the two-handed &s;word, the antient weapon of the <HI>Britons,</HI> as exemplified in a &s;tatue of a &s;oldier, found in digging among the ruins of <HI>London,</HI> after the great fire in 1666<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Monfaucon's Antiq.</HI> iv. 16. tab. ix.</NOTE>; IV. <HI>Chwarau Ffon Ddwybig,</HI> or playing with the two-end &s;taff; which &s;eems to corre&s;pond with the more modern quarter-&s;taff.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e were the ten <HI>Mabolgampau,</HI> or JUVENILE games. Among them, three &s;pecies of the chare: I. Cour&s;ing with the gre-hound; II. Fi&s;hing; III. Fowling. The remaining &s;even were of the dome&s;tic kind: I. <HI>Bairddoniath,</HI> or poetical competi|tions, of which I have before &s;poken<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In my account of the <HI>Ei&s;teddfoddau Caerwy, Tour in Wales,</HI> i. 427 to 446, &s;ome light is thrown on this and certain of the following articles.</NOTE>; II. Playing upon the harp; III. Reading <HI>Wel&s;h;</HI> IV. Singing a <HI>Cywydd</HI> with mu&s;ic; V. Singing a <HI>Cywydd</HI> between four with accents; VI. Drawing of coats of arms; VII. Heraldry. The&s;e two &s;eem &s;o conge|nial, as to be unnece&s;&s;arily &s;eparated.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e were four <HI>Go-gampiau,</HI> or <HI>Sub-games.</HI> I. <HI>Chwa|rau Gwydd-bwyll,</HI> a game like that of Draughts, played with <HI>men,</HI> and probably the game of <HI>Fox and Goo&s;e, Gwydd</HI> &s;ignify|ing a goo&s;e, and <HI>Gwerin y Wyddbwyll</HI> the men of that game.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="311" REF="336">II. CHWARAU <HI>Tawl Bwrdd,</HI> is probably <HI>Back gammon:</HI> words of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> origin; <HI>bach</HI> little, and <HI>gammon</HI> a battle, the <HI>&s;trife of game&s;ters:</HI> and <HI>Tawl bwrdd</HI> is literally the ca&s;t on the table.</P>

<P>AFTER leaving the antiquities of <HI>Goddw Gl&acirc;s,</HI> I joined the turnpike road above <HI>Sychnant.</HI> On the left, was pointed to me a lofty hill, impending over <HI>Conway March.</HI> On its &s;um|mit is <HI>Ca&s;tell Caer Lleion,</HI> a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> po&s;t, &s;urrounded with ditches, and &s;trong ramparts of &s;tones; an additional defence to the country, be&s;ides that of <HI>Penmaen Mawr.</HI> The view of part of <HI>Conway,</HI> and a large bend of the river, with its rich and wooded banks, are &s;een from the de&s;cent to them to great advantage.</P>
<P>I ENTERED CONWAY at the upper gate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONWAY.</NOTE> A more ragged town is &s;carcely to be &s;een, within; or a more beautiful one, without. The &s;ituation is on a &s;teep &s;lope to the verge of the river, here a mile broad at high-water. The form is nearly triangular, &s;urrounded with lofty walls, guarded by twenty-four round towers. The lower face of the triangle borders on the river. A ca&s;tle of matchle&s;s magnificence ri&s;es on a lofty rock, at one corner; and from near each end of the town-walls, fronting the <HI>Conwy,</HI> a curtain terminated with a round tower ran &s;ome way into the river, the more effectually to prevent the approach of an enemy from the water. Only one of the&s;e curtains exi&s;ts; the other, with both the towers, have long &s;ince peri&s;hed.</P>

The ground called <HI>Arcadia,</HI> laid out by my worthy friend and old &s;chool-fellow <HI>Owen Holland,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and <HI>Pl&acirc;s-tyrion,</HI> the hou&s;e of the reverend Mr. <HI>Owen Jones,</HI> well merit a vi&s;it from the traveller.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;tle was built by <HI>Edward</HI> I. in the year 1284; who, I believe, employed the architect who built <HI>Caernarvon.</HI> All his &s;kill &s;eems to have been exerted here. A more beautiful fortre&s;s never aro&s;e. Its form is oblong, placed on all parts on the verge of the precipitous rock. One &s;ide is bounded by the river; another by a creek full of water at every tide, and mo&s;t beautifully &s;haded by hanging woods. The other two &s;ides face the town. Within are two courts; and on the out&s;ide project eight va&s;t towers, each with a &s;lender one of amazing elegance i&s;&s;uing from its top, within which had been a wind|ing &s;tair-ca&s;e. In one of the great towers is a fine window, in form of an arched rece&s;s, or bow, ornamented with pillars. This, in antient times, was an elegant part of architecture, called the <HI>oriel,</HI> u&s;ual in the hou&s;es of people of rank; and appears, from a poem of the very age in which this was built, to have been the toilet of the ladies, and probably might have been that of Queen <HI>Elinor.</HI>

<P>IN church, at the name of the Devil, an univer&s;al &s;pitting &s;eized the congregation, as if in contempt of that evil &s;pirit; and whenever <HI>Judas</HI> was mentioned, they expre&s;&s;ed their ab|horrence of him by &s;miting their brea&s;ts.</P>

The &s;e|cond fall reaches the bottom, and a&s;&s;umes the name of the <HI>Rhaiadr,</HI> or the ca&s;cade. The de&s;ect of this noble fall, is the want of wood. When I vi&s;ited it, the approach was very bad; but that is not only effectually remedied by the late benevo|lent vicar, but, as I am informed, he has be&s;ides erected a cot|tage, as a retreat to the traveller from the fury of a &s;torm.</P>
<P>THE abundance of &s;heep, which enliven the&s;e hills, brought, at the time I vi&s;ited the country, great wealth into it.

<P>LEAVE <HI>Bodfach;</HI> and, for the &s;ake of a beautiful view, am led by Mr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> a little out of my way, to the top of a hill, from whence is a pro&s;pect of a rich expanded vale, with the church of <HI>Llanvechan</HI> in the mid&s;t.

<P>To revert to the Chri&s;tian antiquities: <HI>Meivod</HI> is &s;aid to have been the archdeaconry of all <HI>Powy&s;tand,</HI> and that it had two churches be&s;ides the pre&s;ent. Whether the chapel, who&s;e ruins were &s;tanding in no very remote period, and was called <HI>Eglwys Gwyddfarch,</HI> from a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;aint of this country, might not have been one, I cannot &s;ay; the other was named <HI>Eglwys Vair,</HI> or the church of the Virgin, which was built in 1155<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Powel, <HI>205.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the chief church were interred the princes and great men of <HI>Powys;</HI> among whom may be enumerated <HI>Madoc ap Meredydd ap Blyddyn ap Cynvyn,</HI> prince of <HI>Powys,</HI> who died in 1160, at <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> and was conveyed here; and the noble <HI>Gryffydd Maelor,</HI> lord of <HI>Bromefield,</HI> who died in 1188<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Powel, <HI>210. 242.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE church-yard of the pre&s;ent is not le&s;s than nine acres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH-YARD.</NOTE> and yields to the mini&s;ter as many pounds, as a pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>NOT far above <HI>Meivod</HI> is an union of two rivers, both of the name of <HI>Vyrnyw:</HI> both of them diverge con&s;iderably from each other, and take their ri&s;e remote from one another. The poeti|cal topographer <HI>Draiton</HI> therefore very ju&s;tly &s;tyles the river

<PB N="355" REF="383">
I could ea&s;ily trace the &s;ite of the antient ca&s;tle: it occupied the &s;pace of about two acres. One &s;ide was guarded by the &s;teep over the river; the other three &s;ides by a va&s;t rampart of &s;tone and earth, and a very deep fo&s;s: a high exploratory mount, on which perhaps had been a ca&s;telet, fills one corner; from which is a clear view of all that pa&s;&s;es up and down the vale.</P>
<P>AFTER, this place was de&s;erted by its princes, the ca&s;tle was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or, as Dr. <HI>Powel</HI> &s;ays, built by <HI>Robert de Vepont,</HI> a potent baron, high in favor with King <HI>John.</HI> It is mo&s;t pro|bable that he only re&s;tored, and &s;trengthened it with new works. In 1112, <HI>Llewelyn ap Jorwerth</HI> laid &s;iege to it; but the king coming with a potent army, obliged <HI>Llewelyn</HI> to retire, and after that cau&s;ed the ca&s;tle to be demoli&s;hed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

<P>IN <HI>Gwern Ddu,</HI> a wood oppo&s;ite to <HI>Mathraval,</HI> beyond the river, is a circular entrenchment; and in a field, beyond the other branch, is a round mount; both which certainly had re|&s;pect, in early times, to the fortre&s;s at <HI>Mathraval.</HI> I mu&s;t therefore agree with the learned <HI>Burton</HI>'s conjecture, that this might have been the <HI>Mediolanum</HI> of the <HI>Romans;</HI> it having been cu&s;tomary with <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> as well as <HI>Saxon</HI> princes, to have their palaces where formerly <HI>Roman</HI> &s;tations had their &s;ituation and being<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burton's Com. <HI>132.</HI></NOTE> Let me add al&s;o, that this might have been the win|ter &s;tation; and the low <HI>Meivod,</HI> &s;ubject to overflowings from the river, the &s;ummer &s;tation.</P>
<P>THE country beyond <HI>Mathraval</HI> grows hilly, clayey, and barren. Pa&s;s by the church of <HI>Llangyniw;</HI> to the left is <HI>Dolar|ddyn,</HI> where <HI>Henry</HI> VII. is &s;aid to have lodged a night.</P>

In an adjacent field is a camp of a very uncommon form. At the &s;outh is a va&s;t exploratory mount, of a conic form, &s;urrounded with a fo&s;s of a va&s;t depth. On the north part of the fo&s;s is an oblong area, about &s;eventy yards wide in the greate&s;t diameter; guarded by a very high rampart, and on the out&s;ide by a ditch. In the lower part is a <HI>porta,</HI> open|ing into a great rectangular camp, about two hundred yards long, and above one hundred broad.

<P>THE fir&s;t attempt towards the walls of this town, <NOTE PLACE="marg">WALLS.</NOTE> was made by <HI>Robert de Bele&s;me;</HI> who, to defend it again&s;t the king's forces, then marching again&s;t him, drew a wall from each &s;ide of the ca&s;tle acro&s;s the i&s;thmus to the water-&s;ide.

<P>THE king had here three ma&s;ters of the mint, who, like the other coiners of the county, were obliged to pay him twenty &s;hillings at the end of fifteen days, while the money was out of the mint, and while it was current. The town paid in all twenty pounds yearly: the king had two-thirds, the &s;heriff one. As &s;oon as the <HI>Norman</HI> reign commenced, it paid to its new earl forty pounds.</P>

on account of the arms which <HI>Nicholas</HI> bore, in right of cer|tain lands of the barony of <HI>Burnel,</HI> be&s;towed on him by his mother.

He had &s;erved as e&s;quire to Sir <HI>Edward Burnel,</HI> without any other dome&s;tic than one boy; and ever &s;ince the death of his ma&s;ter a&s;&s;umed the arms in di&s;pute. It happened that they both were at the fiege of <HI>Calais,</HI> under <HI>Edward</HI> III. in 1346, arrayed in the &s;ame arms. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Lord <HI>Burnel,</HI> challenged the arms as belong|ing to the <HI>Burnels</HI> only, he having at that time under his com|mand a hundred men, on who&s;e banners were his proper arms. Sir <HI>Peter Corbet,</HI> then in his retinue, offered to combat with <HI>Robert de Morley</HI> in &s;upport of the right which his ma&s;ter had to the arms; but the duel never took place, probably becau&s;e the king denied his a&s;&s;ent. The &s;uit was then referred to the court of chivalry, held on the &s;ands before <HI>Calais,</HI> before <HI>Wil|liam Bohun,</HI> earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> high con&s;table of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Beauchamp,</HI> earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> earl mar&s;hal.

On this the king, out of per&s;onal regard for the &s;ignal &s;ervices he had performed in tho&s;e arms, and con&s;i|dering the right of <HI>Nicholas</HI> Lord <HI>Burnel,</HI> was de&s;irous to put an end to the conte&s;t with as little offence as po&s;&s;ible.

therefore &s;ent the earl of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and other lords, to <HI>Nicholas,</HI> to reque&s;t that he would permit <HI>Robert de Morley</HI> to bear the arms in di&s;pute for the term of his life only; which <HI>Nicholas,</HI> out of re&s;pect to the king, a&s;&s;ented to.

This they performed in the church of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> near <HI>Calais;</HI> and their &s;entence was immediately proclamed by a herald, in the pre&s;ence of the whole army there a&s;&s;embled.</P>

<P>WALES was the refuge to the antient <HI>Britons,</HI> when they were driven by the <HI>Saxons</HI> out of <HI>England;</HI> and there they pre|&s;erved the antient blood royal of their kings, their laws, and antient language, from the fury of the <HI>Saxons.</HI></P>
<P>There continued an implacable hatred and wars between the two nations. And though the heptarchy was reduced to a monarchy by <HI>Egbert</HI> king of the <HI>We&s;t-Saxons</HI> (who fir&s;t called that part England) yet he and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors received no obe|dience or &s;ubjection from the kings or princes of <HI>Wales;</HI> but they held <HI>Wales</HI> as ab&s;olute monarchs, and acknowledged no &s;u|perior under God.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Cadwallader</HI> (the la&s;t king of <HI>Britain</HI> of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> line) and his de&s;endants, did govern the people, as their lawful kings and princes, all the time of the <HI>Saxon</HI> government.</P>
<P>When <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror &s;ubdued <HI>England,</HI> he di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the <HI>Saxon</HI> i&s;&s;ue of the crown; he rooted out mo&s;t of their nobility, and brought in his own people, the <HI>Normans:</HI> and when he was in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom, the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> took no notice of his conque&s;t over the <HI>Saxons;</HI> but accounted of it only as a war between two &s;trange nations.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="460">Long before the Conque&s;t, all <HI>Wales</HI> fell to <HI>Roderick</HI> the Great; who divided it between his three &s;ons: to <HI>Cadell</HI> he gave <HI>South Wales,</HI> containing 25 cantreds; to <HI>Anarawd, North Wales,</HI> of 15 cantreds; and to <HI>Mervyn, Powys,</HI> of 14 cantreds.</P>
<P>The i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e three &s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>Wales,</HI> according to the &s;aid divi&s;ion, in the Conqueror's time; viz. <HI>Rice,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Theodore,</HI> ruled <HI>South Wales; Griffith ap Conan, North Wales;</HI> and <HI>Blethyn ap Confyn, Powys.</HI> The&s;e three princes would ne|ver acknowledge that the Conqueror had any &s;uperiority over <HI>Wales:</HI> and for this rea&s;on there aro&s;e cruel wars between them, and they made daily incur&s;ions on each other.</P>
<P>The kings of <HI>England</HI> often invaded the borders of <HI>Wales,</HI> and forced the inhabitants to fly to the mountains; and the <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> at other times, made divers inroads over <HI>Severn,</HI> and car|ried great &s;poils out of <HI>England.</HI> This &s;o provoked them, that they re&s;olved to make a conque&s;t of <HI>Wales;</HI> but the roughne&s;s of the country, the hills, woods, and bogs, was &s;uch a pro|tection, that a great army could hardly be brought to annoy them; but were often forced to return home with lof&s;s. As <HI>William Rufus,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> II. who entered <HI>Wales</HI> three times with royal armies; King <HI>John</HI> made war upon <HI>Llewelin ap for|werth,</HI> prince of <HI>North Wales,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> III. upon <HI>Llewellin ap Griffith,</HI> which brought great lo&s;s to them&s;elves, as well as da|mage to the <HI>Wel&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The kings of <HI>England,</HI> &s;eeing it difficult to make a conque&s;t of <HI>Wales</HI> by a great army, gave to the lords, and other great men of <HI>England,</HI> &s;uch countries in <HI>Wales</HI> as they could win from the <HI>Wel&s;hmen.</HI> The&s;e are the words of divers of their grants.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="461">By the&s;e means many were drawn to bring great armies of <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> and <HI>Normans</HI> into <HI>Wales;</HI> who conquered many great lord&s;hips; which they held to them and their heirs for ever, of the kings of <HI>England,</HI> as lands purcha&s;ed by conque&s;t.</P>
<P>The kings of <HI>England</HI> having built divers &s;trong towns of garri&s;on on the frontiers of <HI>Wales,</HI> after the Conque&s;t; &s;uch as <HI>Bri&s;tow, Glouce&s;ter, Worce&s;ter, Salop,</HI> and <HI>Che&s;ter;</HI> as places ready to cha&s;ti&s;e the <HI>Wel&s;hmen</HI> upon all attempts, the great men began to invade the countries next to tho&s;e towns; as namely, <HI>Peter Corbet</HI> for <HI>Cau&s;e; Mortimer</HI> for <HI>Wigmore; Fitz-alan</HI> for <HI>Clun</HI> and <HI>O&s;we&s;try; Walter Lacy</HI> for <HI>Ewyas-Lacy; Dru de Ba|ladan</HI> for <HI>Abergaveny; Monthault</HI> for <HI>Hawarden; Gilbert</HI> lord of <HI>Monmouth</HI> for <HI>Monmouth; Fulk Fitz-warren</HI> for <HI>Whittington; Roger le Strange</HI> for <HI>Ele&s;mere:</HI> and &s;hortly after came <HI>Robert Fitz-hamon,</HI> with his twelve knights, into <HI>Glamorgan; Bernard Newmarch</HI> into <HI>Brecknock; Strongbow</HI> to <HI>Dyfed</HI> or <HI>Pembroke&s;hire; Martin</HI> to <HI>Kemes; Morris de Londres</HI> to <HI>Cydwel&ycirc;</HI> and <HI>Cornwallon; Lacy</HI> earl of <HI>Lincoln</HI> to <HI>Rh&ocirc;s</HI> and <HI>Rhyvoniog,</HI> now the lord&s;hip of <HI>Denbigh; Brewis</HI> to <HI>Gower, Buelt, Radnor, Melenith,</HI> and <HI>El|vel;</HI> and to <HI>Roger Mortimer</HI> the country now called <HI>Chirk,</HI> then called <HI>Mochnant,</HI> and to <HI>Cynlleth</HI> and <HI>Nantheudw&ycirc;</HI> and others to other lord&s;hips.</P>
<P>That the lords might the better govern the people when &s;ubdued, they were &s;uffered to take upon them &s;uch preroga|tive and authority, as were fit for the quiet government of the country.</P>
<P>The antient hi&s;toriographer, <HI>Lampridius,</HI> &s;aith, that the kings of <HI>England</HI> did then u&s;e the &s;ame policy with lands on the borders of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="462">No record to be found in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> or el&s;ewhere, of any grant to be a lord&s;hip marcher in <HI>Wales.</HI> The king's writs, out of the courts at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> did not run into <HI>Wales,</HI> except <HI>Pembroke&s;hire;</HI> which was counted part of <HI>England,</HI> and called <HI>Little England</HI> beyond <HI>Wales.</HI> Nor were there any &s;he|riffs to execute &s;uch writs: but the lords did execute laws them&s;elves over the people which they &s;ubdued; which the kings permitted for a time.</P>
<P>No charters of the&s;e liberties could conveniently be granted, for three rea&s;ons.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The kings of <HI>England</HI> did not know beforehand what lands a lord &s;hould conquer, or whether he &s;hould conquer any; and therefore could not grant any liberties within a certain precinct or territory.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The lords, after their conque&s;t of any country, were not over-ha&s;ty to purcha&s;e any charter; becau&s;e they were not &s;ure but that tho&s;e lands might be re&s;tored, by compo&s;ition between the kings of <HI>England</HI> and the princes, of <HI>Wales,</HI> as they &s;ome|times were: or they might be recovered by force, and the lords expelled. But,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The learned &s;ay, that the lords marchers had no charters of &s;uch liberties, becau&s;e the liberties were of &s;o high a na|ture, &s;o royal, and &s;o united to the crown, that, by the law, it was not in the king's power to grant them from the crown.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The government by lords marchers continued in <HI>Wales</HI> till the time of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII; who, perceiving the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> to live in quietne&s;s and &s;ubjection, thought they might be governed by civil laws, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were. And therefore, anno 27, c. 24, he re&s;umed mo&s;t of tho&s;e juri&s;dictions into his own hands, and
<PB N="434" REF="463">
appointed ju&s;tices of peace, &s;heriffs, and other officers; and di|vided the country into &s;hires. He governed them by the laws of <HI>England;</HI> and left little or no authority to the lords marchers.</P>
<P>The lords, at their, conque&s;t of the country, built ca&s;tles for them&s;elves, and towns for their followers, in the mo&s;t fertile part: and by this means the towns and ca&s;tles in <HI>Wales</HI> were built, as may be &s;een in the antient charters of tho&s;e towns.</P>

<P>Some of the&s;e were towns before the Conque&s;t; but, being de&s;troyed in the winning of them, they were rebuilt by the lords.</P>
<P>The lords held their lord&s;hips of the kings of <HI>England</HI> in chief, as of the crown immediate, by &s;erving the king in his wars with certain numbers of men; and they were bound to keep their ca&s;tles with &s;ufficient men and munition, for the keeping of the king's enemies in &s;ubjection.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="464">They executed the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> laws, for the mo&s;t part, within their lord&s;hips; and brought them to be of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tenure; and to pa&s;s the &s;ame according to the laws of <HI>England,</HI> by fine, recovery, feoffment, and livery of &s;ei&s;in. But &s;uch parts as they left to the antient inhabitants to po&s;&s;e&s;s, were by &s;ome lords &s;uffered to be held after the old <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> cu&s;tom, the laws of <HI>Howel Dda;</HI> which was, to pa&s;s the &s;ame by &s;urrender in court (which they called <HI>C&ocirc;f L&ycirc;s,</HI> and <HI>Y&s;t&ycirc;n Wialen,</HI> whereof the word <HI>Y&s;tynnol</HI> was derived): and where that cu&s;tom was permitted, there is no deed to be found of any lands before the 27th <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. when <HI>Wales</HI> was made &s;hire-ground; but, for &s;uch lands as were turned to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tenures, you may find deeds of two, three, or four hundred years pa&s;t, written in <HI>Latin,</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> as was u&s;ed in <HI>England</HI> in tho&s;e days.</P>
<P>The laws of <HI>England</HI> were brought in by the lords marchers, becau&s;e the laws of the land were unknown to the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> but they &s;uffered the antient tenants to retain &s;ome part of the old <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> laws; &s;uch as the u&s;e of gavelkind, for parting lands between the brothers, and the pa&s;&s;ing of lands by &s;urrender in court. And for this, in many lord&s;hips, there is a <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> court for the <HI>Wel&s;hmen,</HI> called <HI>Welchrie;</HI> and another for the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> called <HI>Engli&s;hrie.</HI> In &s;ome lord&s;hips the lands were divided by gavelkind, but pa&s;&s;ed by feoffments; from whence comes <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> tenure, and <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> dole: in <HI>Wel&s;h, Cyfraith Sae&s;nig, a Rhan-Cymraig.</HI> And the lords had the ward&s;hip of all the brethren, as if they had been &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>The lords marchers increa&s;ed in number, till <HI>Llewellin ap Griffith,</HI> the la&s;t prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> was &s;lain, anno 11 <HI>Ed.</HI> I; who then took the principality of <HI>Wales</HI> into his hands, and
<PB N="436" REF="465">
gave it to <HI>Edward</HI> II. his &s;on, and made him prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> Since which time no more lord&s;hips marchers could be erected; for the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> in general &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the kings of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Since the principality came to the kings of <HI>England,</HI> no lord marcher could claim any liberty or prerogative, more than they had before, without a grant.</P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> I. immediately held a parliament at <HI>Ruthlan</HI> ca&s;tle; and there ordained laws and officers, to govern <HI>Wales</HI> after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> manner.</P>
<P>The lord&s;hip of <HI>Pow&ycirc;s</HI> had not its original from conque&s;t:, as the lord&s;hips marchers had; but in this manner:</P>
<P><HI>Griffith,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Meredith ap Blethyn,</HI> lord of <HI>Pow&ycirc;s,</HI> &s;eeing the king of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lords, preparing them&s;elves to conquer <HI>Wales,</HI> did, in di&s;cretion and policy, &s;ubmit him&s;elf to <HI>Henry</HI> I. and yielded to hold his lord&s;hip of the king of <HI>England</HI> in chief, as the lords marchers did, and to do the king the like &s;ervice; and thereupon was &s;uffered to hold the &s;ame to him and his heirs; and was created lord <HI>Pow&ycirc;s</HI> by the &s;aid <HI>Henry</HI> I. and made baron of the parliament of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>His de&s;cendant, <HI>Haw&ycirc;s Gadarn,</HI> fell to be the king of <HI>Eng|land</HI>'s ward, by rea&s;on of the alteration of the tenure in capite; who gave her in marriage to a valiant gentleman of his, named <HI>John Charlton.</HI> And &s;o the lord&s;hip of <HI>Pow&ycirc;s</HI> came to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lords.

<P><PB N="441" REF="470">From the river <HI>Tifi,</HI> in <HI>South Wales,</HI> to the river <HI>Conwy,</HI> in <HI>North Wales,</HI> there was no lord&s;hip marcher; but all that coun|try remained wholly to the princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> until the princi|pality came to the crown by Prince <HI>Llewellin</HI>'s death.</P>
<P>As the river <HI>Severn</HI> was the antient limit between <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> a doubt hath ari&s;en, why all the land that is over that river, <HI>viz.</HI> all <HI>Hereford&s;hire,</HI> and &s;o much as is part of <HI>Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire, Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> had not been lord&s;hips marchers, as the re&s;t of <HI>Wales</HI> was, that was won &s;ince the Con|que&s;t.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on is this: All <HI>Hereford&s;hire,</HI> and tho&s;e parts of the other counties, were won from the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> in, or &s;hortly after, the time of <HI>Offa</HI> king of <HI>Mercia.</HI> The <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> were expelled thence, the country was new planted with <HI>Engli&s;hmen;</HI> and this was long before the dividing of <HI>England</HI> into &s;hires.

<P>So much of <HI>Wales</HI> as the <HI>Saxon</HI> kings won, they did it at their own charge, and for their own u&s;e; and did not &s;uffer their &s;ubjects to deal therein. But the <HI>Norman</HI> conqueror, content|ing him&s;elf with the realm of <HI>England,</HI> did not bend his forces again&s;t <HI>Wales</HI> more than he was forced to do, by their invading of his people and country; and he, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, thought

I &s;ayd yea; but that I co^d not enter for the pre&s;&s;e. Then the gent made me place, and brought me clo&s;e to the place; where, in interpretinge unto me the manner of all circum&s;tances, he was louder than the curit who babtized the child.

The companie, being many that came about me, &s;eeing I was a &s;tranger, to hear what the other gent and I di&s;cour&s;ed of. I was a&s;ked by the parent of the child, in what &s;ort we differed in <HI>England</HI> from the manner of <HI>France</HI> in babti&s;me? I an&s;wered, that our children wear not &s;o well fed, before they received babti&s;me,

as this child was. The gent fell all to a laughter; for indeed the child was &s;o ould that he was almo&s;t ready to goe, and had &s;uch a broad face, that all the companie were made merry with the mouths the child made at the prei&s;t, duringe the time he was u&s;ing his office.

<HEAD>N^o X. ACCOUNT OF SIR RICHARD BULKELEY; IN WHICH IS A STRONG DESCRIPTION OF THE TYRANNY OF THE FAVORITE EARL OF LEICESTER.</HEAD>
<P>SIR <HI>Rich^d Bulkeley</HI> &s;erved in parl^t for the county of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> the 2^d and 3^d &s;e&s;&s;ions of Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> the 3^d of <HI>Eliz.</HI> and 1^s^t of <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>He was of goodly per&s;on, fair of complexion, and tall of &s;ta|ture. He was temperate in his dyet, not drinking of healths. In his habit, he never changed his fa&s;hion; but always wore round breeches, and thick bumba&s;t doublets, though very gallant and
<PB N="467" REF="496">
rich. In the la&s;t year of Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> being then &s;omewhat &s;tricken in years, he attended the coun&s;il of marches at <HI>Ludlow,</HI> in winter-time. When the lord pre&s;ident <HI>Zouch</HI> went in his coach to church, or el&s;ewhere, Sir <HI>Richard</HI> u&s;ed to ride on a great &s;tone hor&s;e; and &s;ome time he wo^d go from his lodging to church, in fro&s;t and &s;now, on foot, with a &s;hort cloak, &s;ilk &s;tockings, a great rapier and dagger, tarry all prayers and &s;er|mon in very cold weather; in&s;omuch y^r L^d <HI>Zouch</HI> was wont to &s;ay, he was cold to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>He was a great reader of hi&s;tory, and di&s;cour&s;es of all e&s;tates and countries; of very good memory; and under&s;tanding in matters belonging to hou&s;ekeeping, hu&s;bandry, maritime af|fayres, building of &s;hips, and maintaining them at &s;ea. He drew his own letters, and an&s;wered all letters with his own hand: and being complayned of at the coun&s;il of the marches for breach of an order of that court, he drew his own an&s;wer&mdash; that he co^d not be evicted out of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion but by cour&s;e of common law&mdash;pleaded <HI>Magna Charta</HI>&mdash;and demanded judge|ment: which an&s;wer being put into court, the chief ju&s;tice, Sir <HI>Richard Shuttleworth,</HI> called for a &s;ight thereof; and after pe|ru&s;al, &s;aid to the coun&s;ellors at the bar, <Q>Look, my ma&s;ters, what a bone S^r <HI>Rich^d Bulkeley</HI> hath ca&s;t into the court, for you to tire upon:</Q> and the matter being argued, it was, re|ferred to the com~on law.</P>
<P>He was a great hou&s;ekeeper, and entertainer of &s;trangers, e&s;pecially &s;uch as pa&s;&s;ed to or from <HI>Ireland.</HI> He nobly enter|tained the earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> in his way there, to be lord lieuten^t. He made provi&s;ion of all nece&s;&s;aries for his table beforehand. He &s;ent yearly two &s;hips to <HI>Greenland</HI> for cod, ling, and other
<PB N="468" REF="497">
fi&s;h; which he did u&s;e to barter in <HI>Spain</HI> for <HI>Malaga</HI> and &s;herrie wines; and always kept a good &s;tocke of old &s;ack in his cellar, which he called <HI>Amabile,</HI> be&s;ides other wines. He kept two parks well &s;tored with Red and Fallow Deer; w^c^h did afford &s;uch plenty of veni&s;on, as furni&s;hed his table 3 or 4 times every week in the &s;ea&s;on, be&s;ides plea&s;uring of friends. He kept &s;everal farms, be&s;ides his deme&s;ne, in his hands, w^c^h fur|ni&s;hed his hou&s;e with fat beef, mutton, lamb, &amp;c. &amp;c. He was an excellent hor&s;eman, and an expert tilter; keeping two great &s;tables of hor&s;es, one in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> and another in <HI>Beaumaris,</HI> and a great &s;tudd of mares. His e&s;tate in <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> was &pound;. 2500, in <HI>Carnarvon&s;hire</HI> &pound;. 800, and in <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> &pound;. 1000, a year: having always a great &s;tock of ready money lying in his che&s;t. He kept many &s;ervants and attendants, tall and proper men: two lacqueys in livery always ran by his hor&s;e: he never went from home without 20 or 24 to attend him. He was a great favo|rite of Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> He had powerful freinds at court, and had the gentry and commonalty of the county of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> at his &s;er|vice, except the <HI>Woods</HI> of <HI>Rho&s;more,</HI> who were always his ennemies.</P>
<P>He had great conte&s;ts with <HI>Dudley</HI> earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter;</HI> who ob|tayned the queens letters patents under the great &s;eal, to be chief ranger of the forre&s;t of <HI>Snowdon:</HI> in which office he be|haved very injuriou&s;ly to the counties of <HI>Merioneth, Carnarvon,</HI> and <HI>Angle&s;ey;</HI> attempting to bring within the bounds and li|mits of that forre&s;t mo&s;t of the freeholders lands in tho&s;e 3 counties; and for that purpo&s;e the earl procured &s;everal com|mi&s;&s;ions from the queen to inquire of encroachments and con|cealments of lands. The return of the jury, in <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> not
<PB N="469" REF="498">
being agreeable to the earls commi&s;&s;ioners, they went in a rage to <HI>Carnarvon,</HI> forcibly entered the exchequer there, ran|&s;acked the records, and carried away what they plea&s;ed; but the earl, after making many attempts, to the great grievance of the country, was obliged to de&s;i&s;t, being defeated in all &s;chemes upon <HI>Snowdon,</HI> by the power and intere&s;t and &s;pirit of Sir <HI>Rich^d Bulkeley.</HI> But, <HI>manet alta mente repo&s;tum,</HI> the earl bore a poy|&s;onous hatred to Sir <HI>Rich^d;</HI> yet he continued &s;till in favor with the queen and coun&s;el, though often mole&s;ted by the earl, his agents and creatures.</P>
<P>S^r <HI>Richard</HI> being one of the deputy lewtenants of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> (upon intelligence of the <HI>Spani&s;h Armadas</HI> threatening <HI>England</HI>) was to ce&s;&s;e the country in arms; and ce&s;&s;ing Mr. <HI>Woods</HI> of <HI>Rho&s;more,</HI> he was highly offended, and thought him&s;elf too heavi|ly loaden: therefore went up to court to the earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> carrying a fal&s;e tale with him, that Sir <HI>Richard Bulkeley</HI> (a little before the attainder and execution of <HI>Tho^s Salu&s;bury,</HI> one of the accomplices of <HI>Anth^y Babington,</HI> the traytor, 1585) had been in the mountains of <HI>Snowdon</HI> conferring with him, and that at a farm of Sir <HI>Richards,</HI> called <HI>Cwmligie,</HI> they had layne together two or 3 nights. The earl, glad of this information, pre&s;ently acquaints the queen and council therewith. Sir <HI>Richard</HI> being called before the council, and examined, ab&s;olutely denied the whole matter. And when the earl, at y^t time pre&s;ident of the queens coun&s;il, did &s;everely inforce it ag^t him, he told the earl to his face, "Your father, and the very &s;ame men as now informe again&s;t me, were like to undoe my father; for, upon the death of K. <HI>Edw.</HI> 6, by letters from your father, he was commanded to proclayme Queen <HI>Jane,</HI> and to mu&s;ter the
<PB N="470" REF="499">
country; which he did accordingly: and had not my mother been one of Queen <HI>Maries</HI> maids of honor, he had come to great trouble and danger." Hearing the&s;e words, the coun&s;il hu&s;hed, and ro&s;e; and Sir <HI>Richard</HI> departed. The earl ha&s;tened to the queen, and told her the coun&s;il had been examining Sir <HI>Richard Bulkeley</HI> about matters of trea&s;on; that they found him a dangerous per&s;on, and &s;aw cau&s;e to comit him to the Tower; and that he dwellt in a &s;u&s;picious corner of the world. "What! Sir <HI>Richard Bulkeley!"</HI> &s;aid the queen; "he never intended us any harm. We have brought him up from a boy, and have had &s;pecial tryal of his fidelity: you &s;hall not comit him." "We," &s;aid the earl, "have the care of your maje&s;tys per&s;on, &s;ee more and hear more of the man than you doe: he is of an a&s;piring mind, and lives in a remote place." "Before God (replyed the queen) we will be &s;worn upon the holy Evan|geli&s;ts, he never intended us any harm;" and &s;o ran to the Bible and ki&s;&s;ed it, &s;aying, "You &s;hall not comitt him: we have brought him up from a boy." Then the lords of the coun&s;ill wrote a letter to D^r <HI>Hugh Bellot,</HI> lord bi&s;hop of <HI>Bangor,</HI> to exa|mine the truth of the accu&s;ation layd to Sir <HI>Richards</HI> charge: which the bi&s;hop found fal&s;e and forged; and &s;o certifyed to the coun&s;il. Whereupon he was cleared, to the queens maje&s;tys great content, to the abundant joy of his country, and to his own great credit and reputation: and afterwards diver&s;e of the lords of the councell wrote letters to the ju&s;tices of a&s;&s;ize of <HI>North Wales,</HI> to publi&s;h Sir <HI>Richards</HI> wrongs, and to notify to the queens &s;ubjects his clear innocence.</P>
<P>But that Sir <HI>Richard</HI> might not re&s;t in peace, one <HI>Green,</HI> be|longing to the earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> in the name of one <HI>Bromfeild,</HI>
<PB N="471" REF="500">

"Have you no other errand (quoth Sir <HI>Richard?</HI>)" "No," &s;ays <HI>Green.</HI> Then S^r <HI>Richard</HI> drew his dagger, and broke <HI>Greens</HI> pate, telling him to carry that as his an&s;wer; he &s;corning to meet &s;uch a knave as <HI>Bromfeild.</HI> This treatment of <HI>Green</HI> highly encrea&s;ed the anger of the Earl. <HI>Bromfeild, Green,</HI> and others of his retayners, plotted mi&s;chief to the per|&s;on of Sir <HI>Richard;</HI> but he &s;tood upon his guard, keeping al|ways 24 &s;tout men, with &s;words, bucklers, and daggers, to de|fend him from their attempts. They hired boats and wherries upon the <HI>Thames,</HI> with a de&s;ign to drown Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> as he &s;ho^d go from <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> to <HI>London;</HI> but he, being privately informed thereof, borrowed the lord mayor of <HI>Londons</HI> barge, furni&s;hed it with men, mu&s;quetts, billets, drums, and trumpets, and rowed along the <HI>Thames,</HI> &s;hot the bridge, and went down to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where the queen kept her court at that time; and at the landing place, over again&s;t the pallace, he cau&s;ed his companie to di&s;charge their mu&s;quets, to beat their drums, and &s;ound their trumpets. The earl of <HI>Leyce&s;ter</HI> hearing there|of, repaired to the queen, and informed her that Sir <HI>Richard Bulkeley,</HI> more like a rebel than a &s;ubject, had come with barges, men, mu&s;quetts, drums, and trumpets; and had &s;hot &s;everal pieces over again&s;t her maje&s;tys palace, to the great terror of her court; a matter not be &s;uffered. The queen &s;ent for Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> and, after hearing his apology for him&s;elf, made the earl freinds with him. Within a while after, the earl &s;ent for S^r <HI>Richard</HI> to his chamber; who coming thither, the earl began to expo&s;tulate with him on &s;everal wrongs and abu&s;es he pretended to have received at his hands; and that

he had lo&s;t &pound;. 10,000 by his oppo&s;ition. But the di&s;cour&s;e end|ed in milder terms, and Sir <HI>Richard</HI> was bidden to dinner; but did eat or drink nothing, &s;ave of what he &s;aw the earl ta&s;t, re|membring Sir <HI>Nic^s Throgmorton,</HI> who was &s;aid to have received a fig at his table.</P>
<P>But the earl of <HI>Lyce&s;ter</HI> dying in <HI>Oct^r</HI> 1588, Sir <HI>Richard Bulkeley,</HI> and his country, enjoyed peace and quietne&s;s from his tyrannical oppre&s;&s;ions, his devices and wicked practi&s;es: and Sir <HI>Richard</HI> &s;urvived to the 28 <HI>June</HI> 1621, when he dyed, aged 88.

<P>THE concurrence of wi&s;dom and affection, in your la&s;t ac|tion of intending the remove of your &s;on, made me &s;ilent in per&s;wading or di&s;&s;wading one way or other; though, I con|fe&s;s, I like better of his continuance, con&s;idering his late de|&s;ire to his book, and profitable endeavours thence amounting; w^c^h, if it were not &s;o &s;urely, love &s;hou'd not &s;o blind me, as to

<P>His &s;cholar&s;hip being gone, upon his return from <HI>London</HI> I was bold to put him unto fellows commons, until, either in this or &s;ome other coll.

This re|moving of him to our commons, will be &s;ome ten pounds a year more chargeable unto you; but I do hold his choice of company (w^c^h now can be none but fellows and gentlemen) and his occa&s;ion of hearing their di&s;cour&s;es, will, in your own judgment, countervail the charges: only this, for his entrance you are to be&s;tow a &s;ilver piece of plate upon the college, of what price you plea&s;e, above 5 marks; and to engrave your arms thereupon: and that is all the charge of admi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>I thank you, Sir, for your charges always with me. Your former &s;o many courte&s;ies, devoided of all requital of my &s;ide, might very well free your wor. from any future co&s;t that way. I have indeed with my proctor&s;hip light upon a mo&s;t loving and re&s;pectful lord, my lord chancellor; who hath rather an indulgent fatherly care of my e&s;tate, than a lordly re&s;pect, as I have, by many immediate favors, lately ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>It was likewi&s;e my good fortune, for I do not, I prote&s;t, at|tribute it to any merit, to give his maje&s;ty, and the prince, &s;ome extraordinary contentment at <HI>Newmarket</HI> upon <HI>Tue&s;day</HI>
