<Q>In the hand of the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ere is a cup; and the wine is red: it is full-mixed, and he poureth out of the &s;ame. As for the dregs thereof, the ungodly of the earth &s;hall drink them, and &s;uck them out.
<BIBL><HI>P&s;alm lxxv. 9.10.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE di&s;pen&s;ations of God with regard to this world, are repre&s;ented in &s;cripture under various &s;imilitudes; not &s;o much with a view to explain them, as to give us &s;uch conceptions of them only, as are nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;Among the&s;e &s;everal images, that of a <HI>cup</HI> is one of the mo&s;t frequent. It occurs in many of the Divine Writers&mdash;in David particularly. He &s;peaks of the <HI>cup of &s;alvation</HI>&mdash; of the <HI>Lord's being the portion of his cup</HI>&mdash;of his <HI>cup running over</HI>&mdash;and here, in this beautiful pa&s;|&s;age, he carries the illu&s;tration farther. <HI>In the hand of the Lord there is a cup; and the wine is red; it is full-mixed, and he poureth out of the &s;ame. As for the dregs thereof, the ungodly of the earth &s;hall drink them, and &s;uck them out.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4">From the&s;e words I &s;hall Fir&s;t examine the <HI>Contents</HI> of the Lord's cup: and &s;hall Secondly and Thirdly &s;hew you how the <HI>Ungodly,</HI> and how the <HI>Godly</HI> drink of it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, with regard to the Contents of the Lord's cup, we are told, <HI>the wine is red,</HI> but <HI>it is full-mixed;</HI>&mdash;that is, however fair the appearances of things may be, however &s;plendid any &s;tate of happine&s;s, or any &s;ituation of life may appear, it is <HI>full-mixed</HI>&mdash;there is always added to it a certain portion of evil. By <HI>evil,</HI> I mean only the u&s;ual misfortunes and afflictions of human life. The&s;e are what temper the <HI>cup of the Lord:</HI> and in this <HI>mixed</HI> &s;tate it is poured out to the inhabitants of the earth.</P>
<P>All nature, as well as man, partakes of this mix|ture.&mdash;We &s;ee &s;torms purifying the air; but at the &s;ame time de&s;troying the labours of men&mdash; the &s;ea&s;ons &s;ometimes kind; but as often inclement &mdash;rains fertilizing the earth; but al&s;o deluging it&mdash;the ground bearing fruits and grain; but weeds al&s;o and noxious herbs&mdash;the ocean expanding its broad bo&s;om for the benefit of commerce; but the &s;cene al&s;o of devouring tempe&s;ts, and overflowing tides.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="5">If we examine animal life, we &s;hall find here al&s;o, as far as it regards man, the &s;ame mixture of good and evil. Some animals are u&s;eful for food; others for labour; and others for conveni|ence; but a greater number we find are mi&s;chiev|ous. The larger bea&s;ts of prey devour by their &s;trength; the inferior by their craft; and the blighting infect by its multitude.</P>
<P>If from the irrational part of nature we take a view of man, and his labours, we &s;hall find the &s;ame mixture of good and evil. In him&s;elf, what a compound is he of virtue and vice? Religion, and hypocri&s;y; hone&s;ty, and deceit; charity, and ma|lice; compa&s;&s;ion, and unfeelingne&s;s; with many other contrarieties, are continually taking their turns in his mind. Good &s;ugge&s;tions often im|pre&s;s him: but temptations are &s;trong; and his practice wayward.</P>
<P>Man being thus compounded of good and evil, all his labours partake of the mixture. His food is turned to intemperance; his dre&s;s to vanity; his amu&s;ements to diffipation. Let him form what &s;chemes, what plans, what &s;y&s;tems he will; let him employ all his little prudence and fore&s;ight in bringing them to perfection, &s;till he will find, mixed with them in &s;ome &s;hape or other, uncer|tainty, di&s;appointment, and mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6">Thus in the various circum&s;tances of his life, good and bad pur&s;ue each other, like the lights and &s;hadows of a &s;tormy day. The &s;un may break out at intervals; yet it never happens, but that either the morning, the noon, or at lea&s;t the evening of his day is ob&s;cured. Light and darkne&s;s are not more connected than good and evil. David al|luding to the&s;e &s;udden changes, tells us, that <HI>heavi|ne&s;s may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</HI></P>
<P>As this is the ca&s;e therefore&mdash;as the <HI>Lord's cup</HI> is thus mixed with bitter as well as &s;weet ingredi|ents; and as we all mu&s;t drink it, let us examine in what way we may drink it be&s;t.&mdash;And fir&s;t let us &s;ee, how the <HI>Ungodly man</HI> drinks it; which was the <HI>Second</HI> point I propo&s;ed to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>The text &s;ays, <HI>he drinks the dregs.</HI> Now the dregs of any liquor are the pernicious parts. It is fairly implied therefore, that the Ungodly man turns both the good and evil of life to his own de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Let us fir&s;t &s;ee him in pro&s;perous circum&s;tances, with the cup of plenty in his hand. Here he ap|pears in a very unfavourable light. Pro&s;perity hardens him. It &s;upplies nouri&s;hment to all his bad pa&s;&s;ions. <HI>His</HI> unfeeling heart is never touched
<PB N="9" REF="7">by the wants of others. All is centered in him|&s;elf.&mdash;If he has been, by the favour of Providence, &s;ucce&s;sful in any trade or profe&s;&s;ion, it is then his language&mdash;at lea&s;t his &s;entiment&mdash;that he has made him&s;elf happy&mdash;let others take the &s;ame means if they will.&mdash;If they have been le&s;s prudent, or le&s;s indu&s;trious than he has been, let them &s;uffer for their folly. In &s;hort, from looking up to no cau&s;e above him; but thinking him&s;elf the &s;ource of all his enjoyments, he begins to fancy him&s;elf &s;uperior to others, and of cour&s;e holds others in contempt. He becomes arrogant, proud, and a&s;|&s;uming; and his features are commonly marked with what the P&s;almi&s;t &s;o expre&s;&s;ively calls <HI>the &s;cornful reproof of the wealthy.</HI></P>
<P>In his gratifications, perhaps the <HI>Ungodly</HI> man takes the road of plea&s;ure. Then all is riot and exce&s;s: religion, con&s;cience, decency, are no limits to him.&mdash;Ruin often &s;ucceeds.</P>
<P>But perhaps he drinks the cup of pro&s;perity more cautiou&s;ly. He has the fore&s;ight to provide again&s;t the ruin which de&s;troys the thoughtle&s;s pro|fligate, and to act under the conduct of worldly wi&s;dom. Then we &s;ee him enjoying his pro&s;pe|rity in a different way. In&s;tead of &s;quandering his wealth, he hoards it. Every increa&s;e of his for|tune increa&s;es al&s;o his de&s;ires. The &s;ame hardne&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="8">of heart, which the other &s;hewed in providing for his plea&s;ures, he &s;hews in rai&s;ing an e&s;tate. Con|&s;cience and religion are equally the &s;corn of both.</P>
<P>The pro&s;perity of the <HI>Ungodly</HI> man takes com|monly one or the other of the&s;e cour&s;es; the <HI>ble&s;&s;ings</HI> of the Lord's cup he turns to his own de&s;truction. As he is ill qualified to receive <HI>good</HI> from the Lord, let us now &s;ee whether he is better qualified to receive <HI>evil;</HI> for, as we ob&s;erv|ed, the cup of the Lord is <HI>full-mixed.</HI> Evil in &s;ome &s;hape, will &s;ooner or later certainly overtake him. When the weight of misfortune, or the di&s;|tre&s;s of &s;ickne&s;s, or the infirmities of age come up|on him, then the <HI>dregs of the Lord's cup</HI> become a bitter potion to him. Like a froward child he knows not what he wants. Every thing di&s;tre&s;&s;es, nothing can plea&s;e him. He never feels the joys of religion&mdash;the heartfelt &s;atisfaction of a good con|&s;cience, and the tranquility of a peaceful mind, which alone can &s;oothe the anxiety of misfortune, or ea&s;e the bed of &s;ickne&s;s. Now he <HI>&s;uffers</HI> that keen di&s;tre&s;s, which he never <HI>pitied</HI> in others&mdash;that want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance him&s;elf, which he never admini&s;|tered to them.</P>
<P>Thus wretched in him&s;elf, you &s;ee him in a &s;till more di&s;agreeable light when he mixes with others.
<PB N="11" REF="9">See him when you will, he is always either finding fault, or making complaint. But follow him home, and you will there find his ill-humours breaking out with double force. Mi&s;erable are all, who are thus unhappily connected with him. In|&s;tead of the mild, &s;weet &s;mile of &s;uffering piety, the &s;oftened look of tenderne&s;s, with which every offer to do him &s;ervice &s;hould be received; he &s;purns the hand that &s;oothes him. The kinde&s;t offers to &s;erve him, are received like injuries. The tenderne&s;s of relations, the con&s;olation of friends, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;waging his ill-humours, &s;erve only to excite them. Peevi&s;h and fretful, he di&s;tributes his own &s;ufferings in large proportions upon his &s;er|vants, dependants, and nearer connections.&mdash;And yet tho you would imagine he was wholly out of love with life, and wi&s;hed for nothing more, than to leave it with di&s;gu&s;t, you are mi&s;taken. He &s;eems fonder of it, at lea&s;t more loth to leave it, than the man who enjoys it mo&s;t. His attachment to the expiring moments of life, is mo&s;t happily expre&s;&s;ed in the text: he not only drinks the dregs of the cup; but he keeps them to his mouth as long as he can&mdash;<HI>he &s;ucks them out.</HI>&mdash;The mo&s;t horrible &s;ight which the world can furni&s;h, is that of a wicked wretch on the edge of eternity; when all hope of
<PB N="12" REF="10">life is over, and he has ju&s;t &s;en&s;ibility enough to &s;ee before him the gulf of de&s;pair. Let us turn a&s;ide from a &s;pectacle, which makes the blood run cold; and &s;ee, as we propo&s;ed <HI>Thirdly,</HI> how the <HI>Godly man</HI> drinks of the Lord's cup.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, the <HI>Godly man</HI> expects to find a portion of evil in his cup. He &s;ees the pro|priety of it, and fully acknowledges the great u&s;efulne&s;s of this <HI>mixture</HI> of good and evil. If the potion were perfectly palatable, he fears he might drink to exce&s;s. If all things went &s;mooth and ea&s;y with him&mdash;if in the current of life, no rubs, no &s;toppages, no difficulties, ever occurred, what would be the con&s;equence? He might be &s;ecure in the mid&s;t of danger. Tho mortal, he might never think of mortality. The difficulties of life &mdash;the frequent checks he meets with, are what put him continually on his guard. Di&s;appointment corrects his pa&s;&s;ions; and &s;hews him that he is not to imagine he mu&s;t have things here as he plea&s;es; but mu&s;t expect his portion of evil. He takes the world therefore for what it is, and does not fix his happine&s;s upon it.</P>
<P>All this in the &s;incerity of his heart, he acknow|ledges, and approves; and thus far even his rea&s;on
<PB N="13" REF="11">carries him. But when he opens the word of God, he finds the various di&s;pen&s;ations of heaven placed in a &s;till ju&s;ter light. He finds this world repre|&s;ented in the go&s;pel as a &s;tate of trial, prepara|tory to future happine&s;s; and the good and evil of life, as the <HI>means of this trial;</HI> contributing equally to <HI>exerci&s;e,</HI> and <HI>prove</HI> his religion.</P>
<P>Many are the virtues which <HI>pro&s;perity</HI> gives him room to exerci&s;e; and which he could not exer|ci&s;e amid&s;t the <HI>evils</HI> of life; and many are the vir|tues, which are the attendants of <HI>affliction;</HI> and are little known in the pro&s;perous hour. He drinks the cup of the Lord, therefore, as the Lord intends.</P>
<P>When it plea&s;es heaven to ble&s;s him; when his de&s;igns &s;ucceed; and his hopes dilate in &s;ome view of happine&s;s before him, "Now is the time," (he &s;ugge&s;ts to him&s;elf) <Q>when I mu&s;t guard my heart with double care. Now is the time, when in&s;o|lence, and wantonne&s;s, and pride, the attendants of a pro&s;perous hour, are mo&s;t liable to corrupt me. Let me be careful to bar all entrance again&s;t them. Let pro&s;perity &s;often my heart, in&s;tead of hardening it. Let me be humble, and mild, and conde&s;cending, and obliging to all. In the mid&s;t of my own enjoyments, let my heart ex|pand.
<PB N="14" REF="12">Let me feel the mi&s;ery of others; and turn my plenty, to the relief of their nece&s;&s;ity.</Q></P>
<P>Again, when it plea&s;es heaven to mix &s;ome bitter ingredient in his cup, &s;till he has the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of acting under the will of God. <Q>Now, he cries, is the time, when I am to exerci&s;e patience and re&s;ignation. Now my religion is put to the te&s;t. <HI>Shall I receive good at the hand of the Lord, and not receive evil?</HI>&mdash;Gracious God! grant that I may improve my heart under this trial of my faith; and make my &s;ufferings through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the means of purifying my affecti|ons. Let me for his &s;ake bear a trifling part of what he bore for me; and let me keep that great pattern of &s;uffering re&s;ignation always be|fore my eyes.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Godly man</HI> drinks of the Lord's cup, and his draught whether &s;weet, or bitter, is whole|&s;ome to him. This ble&s;&s;ed re&s;ignation of his own will in all in&s;tances to the will of God, regulates his affections&mdash;corrects his thoughts&mdash;and draws him back to the &s;ober recollection of his &s;tation here; by checking each idea as it ari&s;es, of worldly happine&s;s. And yet, tho this pious re|&s;ignation le&s;&s;ens the world in his eye, it is &s;o far from interfering with his worldly happine&s;s, that
<PB N="15" REF="13">it &s;heds the &s;un&s;hine of chearfulne&s;s continually in his brea&s;t.&mdash;But mo&s;t of all when the world &s;inks under him, he feels its ble&s;&s;ed effects. While life is extingui&s;hing, it is a cordial to pain; and gives tranquility to death.</P>
<P>Let us then after the <HI>Godly man's</HI> example, take the Lord's cup with all its ingredients <HI>full-mixed,</HI> in|to our hands. Let us always remember who&s;e cup it is, and who <HI>pours it out.</HI> It is the Lord him&s;elf Whatever therefore the draught is, let us con&s;ider it as mixed and tempered by the great phy&s;ician of our &s;ouls. It may be unpalatable&mdash;but it is our own fault, if it be not beneficial.</P>
