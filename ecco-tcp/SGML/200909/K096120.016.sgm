<HEAD>NAPLES.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP X.</HI> Of the Two Calabrias.</HEAD>
<P>FROM Tarento &s;outhward, run the provinces of the Calabrias, which compri&s;e that whole penin|&s;ula, called the foot of Italy, from its re&s;embling the foot, as the Terra di Otranto does the heel, and is &s;o called on that account. The country extends from latitude 40, to below 38, and is that part of Naples which &s;uffered &s;o much by an earthquake.</P>
<P>At the mouth of the river Ba&s;iento, near Terre di Mare, a town in ruins, built by the Angevino kings, as a &s;afeguard to the coa&s;t, are two rows of coar&s;e marble columns, that mark the &s;ituation of Metapon|tum; ten in one row, and five in the other; their
<PB N="4" REF="4">
diameter, five feet; their height, &s;ixteen feet; the in|ter&s;tices ten feet: they are of the ancient Doric order. The&s;e are all the ve&s;tiges of Metapontum; a city which, two thou&s;and years ago, &s;tood in the &s;kirts of a plain, twenty-five miles in length, and was in the zenith of its glory. <HI>Pythagoras</HI> &s;pent the la&s;t years of his life here. The Metapontines were warm parti|zans of <HI>Hannibal.</HI> He made this city his head quar|ters; and, in the retreat of the Carthaginians, it was puni&s;hed by the Romans, for its attachment to <HI>Han|nibal,</HI> with its lo&s;s of liberty. This whole di&s;trict was a colony of indu&s;trious and wealthy farmers; and there cannot be a &s;ight more mortifying to the pride of man, than this wide &s;tretched tract of land, almo&s;t without an inhabitant, full of briars and mar&s;hes, and &s;tagnant pools; and, in&s;tead of navigable rivers, in who&s;e deep and capacious bo&s;om, whole fleets might moor with &s;afety, the Ba&s;ianto road, has the appear|ance of a &s;traggling torrent; impeded by &s;and-banks, that &s;hift at every &s;hower, and drive the waters back over half the plain, keeping them there to pu|trify.</P>
<P>At the wood near the banks of the Agri, eleven miles more to the South, and about three miles from the &s;ea, are &s;ome heaps of rubbi&s;h, that fix the &s;itu|ation of Heraclea; and near the mouth of the Linno, &s;tood the city of Tyris, founded by the Trojans, and
<PB N="5" REF="5">
renowned for its college of prie&s;ts, &s;killed in cabali&s;|tic lore. Heraclea was the place of rendezvous, agreed on by the whole Greek confederacy, where their ge|neral intere&s;ts and di&s;putes were to be &s;ettled.</P>
<P>Upper Calabria, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> &s;eems decrea&s;ing in its number of people; owing, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, to the cu&s;tom of the Calabrians never marrying beyond the limits of their own town&s;hip. Farms are here let for two years only; indeed, the Baians con&s;ider little but their own plea&s;ure, and keep the lands wa&s;te, for the &s;ake of extending their chace; &s;o that the pea|&s;ants, their va&s;&s;als, have neither room nor opportu|nity, to rai&s;e &s;ufficient food for their &s;upport; they fly, therefore, to the convents, and take the religious habit. And the father of a family, when pre&s;&s;ed for payment of taxes, and &s;inking beneath the load of hunger and di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>va alla montagna,</HI> that is, retires to the woods; where he meets with fellow &s;ufferers, turns &s;muggler, and becomes, by degrees, an outlaw, robber, and an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.</P>
<P>The women here breed fa&s;t, and bring forth their offspring almo&s;t without a pain. It is a common thing for a woman, pregnant with child, to go up to the fore&s;t for fuel, to be there &s;urpri&s;ed with the pains of childbirth, to deliver her&s;elf without di&s;may, and fold up her infant in her apron; and, after a little re&s;t,
<PB N="6" REF="6">
return to her cottage. <HI>Che una &s;erva Calabre&s;e piu ama far un figlio che un bucato,</HI> is a proverb much in u&s;e in the neighbouring provinces; that is, "A Calabrian maid-&s;ervant prefers the labour of a childbirth, to that of a wa&s;h."</P>
<P>The territory of Ro&s;etta produces olives, capers, corn, &s;afforn, and cotton. The mountains abound with fine oak timber, fit for &s;hipping; and the woods are well &s;tocked with game. Calabria is too hilly to admit of hunting. All game is brought down by the gun, or taken in the net. They have an exceeding good &s;paniel; &s;o good, that the king has taken pains to increa&s;e the breed. The lower parts of the moun|tains abound with the Ormus, or &s;mall-leaved flower|ing Manna-a&s;h, which grows &s;pontaneou&s;ly. About the end of July, the manna-gatherers make a horizon|tal ga&s;h in the bole of a tree, inclining upwards; as the liquor never oozes out the fir&s;t day, another cut is given on the &s;econd, and then the woodman fixes the the &s;talk of a maple leaf in the upper wound, and the end of the leaf in the lower one, &s;o as to form a cup to receive the gum, as it oozes from each cut. All manna belongs to the king, who farms it to a &s;et of contractors.</P>
<P>All live animals in Calabria are taxed; another check on hu&s;bandry; three &s;hillings a year are paid
<PB N="7" REF="7">
for an ox. Arable land is here ploughed four times; the fir&s;t in May, but the work is badly done. They never lay down their lands with artificial gra&s;&s;es; but a Calabrian farmer thinks he does his farm ample ju&s;tice, if he lets it lie barren three or four years, and cover it&s;elf with natural gra&s;s.</P>
<P>The roads through Calabria are very bad; there is but here and there an inn, and at the&s;e the accommo|dations are very poor. Tho&s;e who travel this coun|try mu&s;t proceed on hor&s;eback, and get recom|mended from city to city. At Ro&s;&s;aro, <HI>Swinburne</HI> &s;ays, there was an encampment of zingari, or gyp&s;ies, who are great thieves. The gyp&s;ies of Calabria do not mix with the other people; they marry among them&s;elves. They have no fixed place of abode, but carry their tents with them, and pitch them where they plea&s;e. They &s;upport them&s;elves by little handi|crafts; and by &s;wopping, or trucking, a&s;&s;es and hor&s;es. Their chief work is in making trivets, knitting needles, bodkins, and the like, in iron. Their dre&s;s is poor; they &s;have their faces, but let their hair grow very long. At their weddings they carry torches, and have para-nymphs to give the bride away. They are ac|counted to be great pilferers, cheats; and to be faith|le&s;s, &s;hamele&s;s, and abandoned to all manner of di&s;&s;o|lutene&s;s. The following anecdote will &s;hew how little
<PB N="8" REF="8">
they are under the controul of mode&s;ty, or fear of &s;hame.</P>
<P>A gang of gyp&s;ies a&s;&s;embled at a fair, with an in|tention of robbing the &s;hops; for which purpo&s;e, a proper number of them were di&s;per&s;ed in the throng, to draw off the attention of the people from their pro|perty. Some of the&s;e men and women went into the adjacent fields, and proceeded to &s;uch indecent liberties, as &s;oon brought mo&s;t of the people of the fair about them, and left their &s;hops a prey to the confident thieves. They tell fortunes, and play jug|gling tricks, as they do in all other countries where they are tolerated. A gyp&s;ey, being brought to Nice for larceny, declared, that his law allowed him to take from others, as much every day as &s;ufficed for his maintenance. They &s;peak here an oriental jargon of their own; and one of the mo&s;t intelligent among them, being a&s;ked, why their nation was a wandering one? replied, they could not remain long in one place, without being over-run with lice. Their pro|pen&s;ity to breed vermin proceeds from their exce&s;&s;ive filthine&s;s; they &s;leep like dogs in a kennel, men, women, and children, and take up no more room when a&s;leep, than if in their graves.</P>
<P>In Calabria, all the oxen are white, large, and long horned, except tho&s;e of the red breed, lately intro|duced
<PB N="9" REF="9">
into Sicily. Their buffaloes are black; &s;o are mo&s;t of the goats, &s;heep, and hogs. Their hogs have no hair, but are as &s;leek in their hides as the elephant. Dormice are here accounted delicate game, as they were in ancient Rome, where they were kept in war|rens, and fatted for the tables of the epicures. The Calabrian hor&s;es are pretty &s;pirited, and brilliant in their motions; but are low, and &s;eldom free from vice; but will travel two hundred and fifty miles in five days, in hot weather.</P>
<P>Croton, the Greek city, who&s;e walls enclo&s;ed a cir|cumference of twelve miles, and alone furni&s;hed &s;uc|cour to the mother-country, when invaded by the Per&s;ians, is now but a &s;mall place, and bears the name of Crotone; and no ve&s;tiges of the ancient city re|main. Near Crotone is an i&s;land, con&s;idered as the habitation of <HI>Calyp&s;o,</HI> but is a rock &s;carcely able to feed a &s;heep.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome cu&s;toms in Calabria, that explain &s;ome allu&s;ions in <HI>Horace.</HI> When he &s;ays, "Death treads, with impartial foot, the doors of palaces and of cottages."</P>
<Q><L>Pallida mor&s;aeque pul&s;at peda paupeum tabernas</L>
<L>Regumque turres.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P><PB N="10" REF="10">He alludes to a cu&s;tom now exi&s;ting, that of the bailiff kicking furiou&s;ly at the door of a debtor, or tenant, that refu&s;es to pay, and &s;huts him&s;elf up in his hou&s;e for &s;afety; which implies, that he means to give no quarter. So <HI>Horace</HI> means, that death is in|exorably bent in exacting the debt of nature. His account of the hardy education, and filial obedi|ence of the Roman youth,
<Q><L>&mdash;Ru&s;ticorum ma&s;cula militum</L>
<L>Proles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
Is &s;till exact with re&s;pect to the young Calabrian pea|&s;ant. After hoeing the ground all day, with no better fare than bread and water, and an onion; he does not pre&s;ume to pre&s;ent him&s;elf before his mother, without bringing her a faggot, or &s;ome other wood. His ani|mated de&s;cription of a mother, longing for the return of her &s;on,
<Q><L>Ut mater juvenem, quem natus invide</L>
<L>Flatu Carpathii, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
May &s;till be applied to the Calabrian matrons. If the feluccas do not appear at the u&s;ual term of their an|nual voyage; the mothers, and wives of the &s;ailors, offer up ince&s;&s;ant prayers, call on the beloved per&s;on by name, and remain at their windows, with eyes
<PB N="11" REF="11">
fixed on the cape, which the bark is to double. The in&s;tant a boat is &s;een coming round the point, the whole town re&s;ounds with joyful cries of <HI>Barca! Barca!</HI> The boys ring the bells; and, as &s;oon as they can di&s;tingui&s;h what felucca it is, run to the relations to claim &s;omething to drink for the good news.</P>
<P>Ca&s;telvetere, in a lofty &s;ituation, three miles from the &s;ea, occupies the &s;cite of Caulon, of which &s;ome ve&s;tiges are &s;aid to exi&s;t. Caulon was one of the earlie&s;t Greek &s;ettlements, but demoli&s;hed by <HI>Diony|&s;ius,</HI> four hundred years before Chri&s;t. <HI>Swinburne</HI> tells us, that when he was in this neighbourhood, he joined a crowd one evening, that was dragging a woman to church, in order to have the devil driven out of her, by exorci&s;m. She was a middle-aged per&s;on, and &s;eemed to be in &s;trong convul&s;ions, which every one &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from a demoniacal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The prie&s;t refu&s;ing to attend, &s;ome of the a&s;&s;i&s;tants grew impatient, and pulled the woman about &s;o roughly, that Beelzebub thought proper to decamp. The patient recovered her &s;en&s;es, got up, and ran away full &s;peed; &s;o that it appeared, there was more roguery in her ca&s;e, than real di&s;order. All convul|&s;ions of this kind are, however, attributed to a&s;&s;aults of malignant &s;pirits. Near fifteen hundred women, pretending to be thus tormented, go up annually to Soriano, to be cured, by looking at a portrait of St.
<PB N="12" REF="12">
<HI>Dominick,</HI> &s;ent down, as they &s;uppo&s;e, from Heaven. Under the&s;e pretexts, they obtain leave of their ty|rannical &s;pou&s;es, to make this plea&s;ant pilgrimage, and a pair of holiday &s;hoes for the purpo&s;e; without which they dare not appear before the picture. A prie&s;t of that convent, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> told me a &s;tory of a female demoniac, who, after going through the u&s;ual cour&s;e of cure, was &s;ent to him to confe&s;s her &s;ins. Being perfectly well acquainted with the com|mon tricks, he ordered her to give him the true rea|&s;on of her acting that farce, threatening her in ca&s;e of ob&s;tinacy, with a vi&s;it from a real devil, who would torment her in good earne&s;t. The poor woman ter|rified at the menace, freely confe&s;&s;ed; that, having been married again&s;t her inclinations to a goat-herd, who &s;tank intolerably of his goats and chee&s;es, &s;he &s;hunned his approach, and feigned demoniac po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, to avoid cohabiting with him. Having thus got the &s;ecret from her, the prie&s;t, in hopes of alle|viating her misfortune, &s;ent for her hu&s;band, and knowing it would be in vain to urge him out of a be|lief of the devil's being in his wife, planned a diffe|rent mode of attack, and informed the &s;imple fellow, that he had di&s;covered what particular kind of &s;pirit it was; that this demon was remarkable for an out|rageous antipathy to goat-herds, and that no exorci&s;ms could prevent him from plaguing him. The poor man, who&s;e fir&s;t profe&s;&s;ion had been gardening, and
<PB N="13" REF="13">
who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s in the other line of bu&s;ine&s;s had not been very great, readily con&s;ented to his old way of labour, in order to keep Satan from his hou&s;e, The friar procured a garden for him, and a chapman for his herd of goats, and &s;oon had the happine&s;s of &s;eeing the married couple well &s;ettled, and perfectly &s;atis|fied with each other.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that the Albanian dialect, in Cala|bria, has many Engli&s;h words, bearing the &s;ame mean|ing as with us; as for example, aunt, boor, breeches, brea&s;t, car, chimney, chide, cough, crab, door, dream, feather, grumble, hunger, and many others. The&s;e people are &s;ettled in Calabria, and emigrated from Albanie, only a few centuries ago: they amount to, at lea&s;t, 100,000, and are di&s;per&s;ed in two hundred villages, or towns; but, many of the&s;e &s;ettlements are wretchedly poor, and much decayed; tho&s;e in the neighbourhood of Bova remarkably &s;o. They are a quiet indu&s;trious people, and their women remarkable for regularity of conduct. In their dre&s;s they pre|&s;erve the co&s;tume of Illyricum, from whence their forefathers came. The mo&s;t beautiful women are generally given in marriage to clergymen, and are exceedingly proud of their hu&s;bands; for, among them, prie&s;thood is the highe&s;t nobility. When an eccle&s;ia&s;tic dies, his widow never enters into a &s;econd engagement, becau&s;e none but a virgin can a&s;pire to
<PB N="14" REF="14">
the hand of a prie&s;t, and any other is beneath her acceptance.</P>
<P>Reggio is the capital of Lower Calabria, an arch|bi&s;hopric, and is &s;ituated on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, at the Southern extremity of Italy, and adjoins the Faro, or &s;treights of Me&s;&s;ina. The approach to this place is charming, every cottage of the &s;uburb being &s;haded with a beautiful arbour of vines, and loaded with clu&s;ters of grapes, that produce a very good &s;ort of wine. Oranges, and their kindred fruits, reach great perfection in the&s;e plains, which are &s;aid to be the fir&s;t &s;pot in Italy, where their culture was attempted. They are found to be much hardier than was at fir&s;t &s;u&s;|pected; many large plantations thriving at the foot of the Appenines, twenty miles from the &s;ea; where, in winter, there is fro&s;t enough to congeal water. The Reggians trade with the Genoe&s;e, in e&s;&s;ence of citron, orange and bergamot. This &s;pirit is extracted, by paring off the rind of the fruit with a broad knife, &s;queezing the peel with wooden pincers, again&s;t a &s;ponge, and when the &s;ponge is full, it is &s;queezed out into a phial, and &s;old at five &s;hillings and &s;ixpence Engli&s;h per ounce.</P>
<P>The country, round Reggio, is a rich delicious gar|den, &s;haded by groves, and avenues of poplars and mulberry-trees; divided by hedges of pomegranates,
<PB N="15" REF="15">
inclo&s;ing vineyards and orchards of orange, citron, and various other kinds of aromatic fruits. Copious &s;treams meander through the&s;e agreeable plains, and di&s;tribute life and vigour to every plant.</P>
<P>The exportation of oil brings into Lower Calabria, half a million of ducats yearly. On each &s;ide of the wood, are hou&s;es erected for &s;ilk-worms, on a par|ticular con&s;truction. The windows are long, and not more than &s;ix inches wide, to prevent too much air being admitted at a time. When the eggs are about to hatch, the&s;e windows are &s;hut, and a moderate fire kept up in the rooms. The worms, as &s;oon as out, are placed on beds of reeds, and there fed with the leaves of the red mulberry-tree. The&s;e hou&s;es are built by the people of Reggio, who furni&s;h every thing, and take two-thirds of the profits.</P>
<P>Figs here have a fine flavour, and the fir&s;t, ever &s;een in Italy, was brought from Sicily, by <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> the tyrant, and planted in his garden at Reggio. The hills, that &s;kirt the great chain of mountains, abound with che&s;nut-trees, producing a very large, &s;weet fruit, which the people dry, grind, knead into a pa&s;te, and u&s;e in&s;tead of bread.</P>
<P>Between Reggio and Scylla, a &s;ilver-mine was opened by the pre&s;ent King of Spain; but, the vein
<PB N="16" REF="16">
dipping towards the &s;ea, and in a rock, the expences would be more than the profits; of cour&s;e, it was abandoned.</P>
<P>Reggio can neither boa&s;t of beautiful buildings, nor &s;trong fortifications. Of all edifices, the Gothic cathedral is the only &s;triking one. There is plenty of fre&s;h water here; wherever a hole is made in the &s;ands, though within a foot of the &s;ea, fre&s;h water bubbles up. The views all around are enchanting. Me&s;&s;ina ri&s;es out of the waves like a grand amphitheatre; and the Faro, or &s;treight, lined with villages and towns, &s;eems a noble view, winding between two bold &s;hores. Sometimes, though very rarely, <HI>Swinburne</HI> &s;ays, it exhibits a very curious phe|nomenon, called <HI>La Fata Morgana,</HI> as if produced by a fairy, or magician. The populace are delighted, whenever the vi&s;ion appears, and are &s;een about the &s;treets, &s;houting for joy. The philo&s;ophic reader will find its cau&s;es and operations accounted for, in <HI>Kircher, Minais,</HI> and other authors. Father <HI>Angelucci</HI> was the fir&s;t per&s;on who de&s;cribed the appearance with any accuracy.</P>
<P>On the 15th of Augu&s;t, 1643, as I &s;tood at my win|dow, &s;ays he, I was &s;urpri&s;ed with a mo&s;t wonderful de|lectable vi&s;ion. The &s;ea, that wa&s;hes the Sicilian &s;hore, &s;welled up, and became, for ten miles in length, like a chain of dark mountains; whil&s;t the waters, near our Calabrian coa&s;t, grew quite &s;mooth, and in an in&s;tant,
<PB N="17" REF="17">
appeared as one clear poli&s;hed mirror, reclining again&s;t the afore&s;aid ridge. On this gla&s;s was depicted, in <HI>chiaro ob&s;curo,</HI> a &s;tring of &s;everal thou&s;ands of pi|la&s;ters, all equal in altitude, di&s;tance, and degree of light and &s;hade. In a moment, they lo&s;t half their height, and bent into arcades, like Roman aqueducts. A long cornice was next formed on the top; and above it ro&s;e ca&s;tles innumerable, all perfectly alike. The&s;e &s;oon &s;plit into towers, which were &s;hortly after lo&s;t in colonades, then windows; and at la&s;t ended in pines, cypre&s;&s;es, and other trees, even and &s;imilar. This is the <HI>Fata Morgana,</HI> which, for twenty-&s;ix years, I con|&s;idered as a fable.</P>
<P>To produce this plea&s;ing deception, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> many circum&s;tances mu&s;t concur, which are not known to exi&s;t in any other &s;ituation. The &s;pectator too mu&s;t be particularly &s;ituated. The winds mu&s;t be hu&s;hed, the &s;urface of the Faro quite &s;mooth, the tide at its height, and the waters pre&s;&s;ed by currents, to great elevation in the middle of the channel. All the&s;e events coinciding, as &s;oon as the &s;un ri&s;es to a cer|tain height, every object exi&s;ting or moving at Reggio, will be repeated a thou&s;and-fold on this ma|rine looking-gla&s;s; and, as the day advances, each image will pa&s;s rapidly off in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="18">Tropea is the next city of note, travelling North|ward on the coa&s;t of Calabria, from Reggio to Naples. It is a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, containing about four thou&s;and people. It derives its name, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> from the trophies erected by <HI>Scipio,</HI> in his triumphant re|turn from Carthage; or from tho&s;e of <HI>Sextus Pompeius,</HI> after his naval victory, off the neighbouring cape. It is &s;ituated on the point of a lofty rock, hanging over the &s;ea, and joined to the main land by an i&s;thmus; almo&s;t cut through at the gates, leaving only a nar|row pa&s;&s;age to the town. A little to the North is a large i&s;land, kept as a pa&s;ture for &s;heep, and a &s;mall one, with a hermitage on its &s;ummit, mo&s;t roman|tically &s;ituated. They have a plea&s;ing effect from Tropea.</P>
<P>The &s;treets of the town are narrow, the hou&s;es high, and built of &s;tone, with great &s;olidity. It has two gates; one towards the Nile that ri&s;es from the bay; and the other along the i&s;thmus, leading to a high plain; in which there is a plea&s;ant walk near two miles in length, and half a mile broad, between the &s;ea and chain of mountains; &s;o &s;teep and rugged, as &s;eems to cut off all communication by land, with the re&s;t of Calabria. The whole flat, and the &s;ides of the hills, yield grapes, mulberries, olives, pul&s;e, and vegetables; and garden fruit in great plenty. Copious &s;treams ru&s;h from the mountain; and, after watering the
<PB N="19" REF="19">
orchards, are collected into one body, and turn a number of mills. The water is conveyed, in a chan|nel, to the edge of a high precipice over the mill, there received into a &s;tone well, from whence it falls a con|&s;iderable height upon an over-&s;hot wheel; and, having turned this, is again collected for a &s;econd mill in a &s;imilar way, and thus turns many, before it reaches the &s;ands. Some of the&s;e ca&s;cades, as they fall through arbours of vines, and groves of orange-trees, are exceedingly beautiful. The wealthy inhabitants of Tropea re&s;ide within the walls; hu&s;bandmen, and labourers dwell on the out&s;kirts, on the land they cultivate.</P>
<P>Two miles Ea&s;t of this town is Paralia; a village inhabited by manufacturers and mariners; who make cotton blankets, and carry them in their own barks to Mar&s;eilles and Genoa.</P>
<P>Strombolo, a volcano, on an i&s;land &s;ixteen leagues We&s;t of this coa&s;t, on our way to Naples, is con|tinually throwing up flames; and yet the place is in|habited by fi&s;hermen, who watch their opportunities, for a quiet moment, to pa&s;s along the &s;trand, or they would otherwi&s;e be buried under a &s;hower of red-hot &s;tones.</P>
<P>Strombolo is one of the Lipari i&s;lands, and a moun|tain about ten miles round, ri&s;ing &s;uddenly from the
<PB N="20" REF="20">
&s;ea, and is more lofty than Ve&s;uvius, only not &s;o co|nical: in clear weather, it is di&s;coverable at twenty-five leagues di&s;tance, at &s;ea; and at night its flames are to be &s;een much farther; &s;o that the vi&s;ible hori|zon, &s;een from the top, cannot be le&s;s than five hun|dred miles; of cour&s;e, it is of great elevation. It is wonderful, that this volcano has been continually burning, for more than a thou&s;and years. It is the lighthou&s;e of the whole coa&s;t, who&s;e fires are never extingui&s;hed. This is the i&s;land, &s;uppo&s;ed by <HI>Virgil,</HI> to be the habitation of <HI>Aeolus.</HI> Indeed, all the Lipari i&s;lands were called Aeolian. Being full of va&s;t ca|verns, &s;ays <HI>Bridone,</HI> roaring with internal fires; the poets feigned, that <HI>Aeolus</HI> here kept the winds pri&s;oners, and let them out at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The forge of <HI>Vulcan</HI> too has been &s;uppo&s;ed, by the poets, to be placed in Hiera, one of the&s;e i&s;lands. <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;ends him here, to make the cele&s;tial armour for <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and gives a noble de&s;cription of this gloomy habitation, where he found the <HI>Cyclops</HI> bu&s;y forging a thunderbolt for <HI>Jupiter;</HI> the account of which is very &s;ingular.</P>

<P>This i&s;land is now called Volcano. All the Lipari i&s;lands bring no incon&s;iderable revenue to the King of Naples. They produce great quantities of allum, &s;ulphur, nitre, cinnabar, and mo&s;t &s;orts of fruits; particularly rai&s;ins, currants, and figs, in great perfec|tion. Some of their wines are al&s;o much e&s;teemed, particularly the Malva&s;ia, well known all over Europe. The i&s;le of Lipari, from which the re&s;t take their name, is by much the large&s;t, and mo&s;t fertile.</P>
<P>It is bad travelling in the province of Calabria; the po&s;t-hou&s;es not being obliged to keep more than three hor&s;es, travellers find it difficult to get on. The country round Tropea re&s;embles a park, being quite open, but &s;haded with irregular avenues and &s;trag|gling clumps of olive-trees, large enough to cut for timber. Monteleone is a con&s;iderable town, on the brow of a hill, &s;ituated in this open country. The barons ca&s;tle occupies the highe&s;t part, embowered in ever-greens; the town covers the re&s;t of the &s;lope in a very happy manner. The pro&s;pects are enchant|ing, the vales covered with wood, and a fine river winds its way through them: the di&s;tant mountains, darkened with exten&s;ive fore&s;ts, and le&s;&s;er hills at their
<PB N="22" REF="22">
feet, &s;welling into view, and inter&s;ected by number|le&s;s glens, from the bo&s;om of which ri&s;es the &s;moke of many &s;eque&s;tered villages. Monteleone contains three pari&s;hes, twelve religious hou&s;es, and thirteen thou&s;and people. The &s;cenes, and environs of this place, equal in beauty the mo&s;t delightful &s;pots in Sicily; and, on the whole, has greatly the advantage over that i&s;land in its general a&s;pect.</P>
<P>This country &s;eems to be &s;tocked with &s;wine. <HI>Swinburne</HI> &s;ays, he &s;aw many very large herds, at|tended by one or two herd&s;men, who led them on by the &s;ound of a great bagpipe. He is per|&s;uaded, that the pre&s;ent Calabrian &s;wineherds, are the exact copies of the ancient ones; and, that their mode of managing the&s;e &s;tubborn animals, has been tran&s;|mitted down by a regular tradition. The hogs are well acquainted with their herd&s;man's note; and if, by accident, two or three herds &s;hould meet together, the &s;ound of each herd's bagpipe, will immediately &s;eparate them.</P>
<P>The Calabrian accent is very different from the Sicilian; being more guttural, and fuller of a&s;pira|tions.</P>
<P>Paula is a town, on the We&s;tern coa&s;t of South Ca|labria, not a great way from the city of Co&s;enza, re|nowned
<PB N="23" REF="23">
for being the birth-place of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> the founder of the order of Minims. He was a pea&s;ant's &s;on, and became the favourite &s;aint, and patron of his native country. The Calabrians have &s;till a great confidence in his mediation with our Saviour; but their mode of applying to him is extraordinary. They approach his &s;tatue, with reverential awe, holding in both hands an a&s;s's halter; this they &s;uddenly throw over the head of the &s;tatue; and, after fixing the &s;lip|knot with a &s;mart pull, repeat their petition, and leave the rope. <HI>Swinburne</HI> &s;ays, there was two hundred pounds weight of rope on his &s;houlders when he &s;aw it. St. <HI>Francis</HI> kept a &s;mall &s;tock of pigeons, for the u&s;e of the infirmary which he founded; and, as they are &s;eldom killed for that purpo&s;e, and held as &s;acred, by all the neighbourhood; the&s;e birds have, in the cour&s;e of near three centuries, increa&s;ed incredibly, and are great nui&s;ances. Some farmers go &s;o far as to &s;ow plots of ground for them, and this from a &s;elfi&s;h view; being per&s;uaded, that the&s;e pigeons have too much honour to meddle with any &s;eed but what is allotted them, unle&s;s &s;uch provi&s;ion be not made for them.</P>
<P>Co&s;enza is an archbi&s;hopric, the re&s;idence of the governor of the province; was the capital of the Brutian &s;tate, and of &s;ome con&s;equence during the &s;econd Punic war. The Saracens reduced it to a&s;hes
<PB N="24" REF="24">
in the tenth century; but it &s;oon recovered from the calamity. <HI>Louis</HI> the Third, of Anjou, died here in 1434, and was buried in the cathedral.</P>
<P>It is plea&s;antly &s;ituated, at the Southern extremity of a &s;pacious plain, twenty miles along the river Crati, very broad, and about twelve miles from the Medi|terranean &s;ea. The city &s;tands upon &s;even hills. From an ancient ca&s;tle, on the highe&s;t of the &s;even hills, the pro&s;pect is very grand over the mountains, on three &s;ides, and down the plain on the other.</P>
<P>There is a great difference in the dre&s;s and man|ners of the two Calabrias. The people of South Ca|labria re&s;emble the Sicilians; and, like them, the men wear bonnets: North of Regliagno, the boundary of the two provinces, hats are univer&s;ally worn. It has been remarked that the Sicilians, even now, betray &s;trong marks in their character, of their ancient con|nections with the Africans; and the North Calabre&s;e of German &s;olidity, ari&s;ing from colonies tran&s;planted there by the Swabian princes; and, in the South Ca|labre&s;e, the Neapolitans are evident traces of Gre|cian manners, and turn of mind; but more &s;o in the latter.</P>
<P>Though Calabria is &s;tigmati&s;ed with di&s;hone&s;ty, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be over-run with banditti, they are
<PB N="25" REF="25">
certainly hone&s;t to each other; for their doors have neither bars, nor bolts; and, during the ab&s;ence of the ma&s;ter, the hou&s;e is left to the mercy of every pa&s;&s;enger.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of their Amu&s;ements, and Mode of Travelling.</HEAD>
<P>WE have given &s;ome of the amu&s;ements of this country, when &s;peaking of Naples, but there &s;till remain &s;ome few to be treated of, particularly the Carnival.</P>
<P>The Carnival is a fe&s;tival that precedes Lent, or the time of fa&s;ting; and is pretty general throughout Italy. It begins on St. <HI>Charles</HI>'s day, and continues till Lent. All this time the city of Naples is very gay, with the cu&s;tomary amu&s;ements of operas, balls, ma&s;querades, &amp;c. terminating with hor&s;e-races in the Strada Toledo; and, &s;ometimes, with a royal ma&s;que|rade proce&s;&s;ion of the Grand Signior to Mecca, which is a mo&s;t magnificent &s;pectacle. The barbarous <HI>Co|cagna,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="26">
in which a prodigious number of calves, &s;heep, hogs, lambs, and poultry, were a&s;&s;embled every Sun|day, in carnival-time, to be torn in pieces by the po|pulace, is now di&s;continued; and, of cour&s;e, ought not to be related.</P>
<P>There are three <HI>Con&s;ervatories</HI> in Naples, for the education of boys in the profe&s;&s;ion of mu&s;ic. The&s;e furni&s;h a band for the church of Franci&s;cans, morning and evening, during eight days in October. The octaves, indeed, or eight days following the fe&s;tival of the patron-&s;aint of every church, are a continual &s;o|lemnity, at which the fine&s;t voices, and be&s;t performers attend, both morning and evening; and the churches at Naples are &s;o numerous, that the octaves make one continued entertainment throughout the year. At the fe&s;tival of <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti,</HI> the riche&s;t churches en|gro&s;s the whole opera, voices, in&s;truments, machines, and decorations.</P>
<P>To give me an idea of this &s;pectacle, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;ley,</HI> I was told that the <HI>&s;anti&s;&s;imo,</HI> being carried up on clouds almo&s;t to the roof of the church of the Je&s;uits, de&s;cends of it&s;elf, for the benediction; making its way through the clouds, which &s;eparate; and, receiving in its pa&s;|&s;age the veneration of angels, and other beings, part of whom leave their &s;tations to attend on it. What can the Greeks think, at the fight of &s;pectacles like
<PB N="27" REF="27">
the&s;e; they, who have no better way of keeping the Euchari&s;t, than in a leather pur&s;e, hung up again&s;t the wall, in the &s;acri&s;ty of their churches?</P>
<P>The common people of Naples are very devout, or rather &s;uper&s;titious. Next to St. <HI>Gennaro,</HI> their patron &s;aint, the Madonnas, which are frequent in the &s;treets, &s;eem mo&s;t to attract their attention. On Chri&s;tmas-eve they play off fire-works the whole night. Indeed, at Chri&s;tmas-time, all quarters of Naples re|&s;ound with <HI>Pa&s;torali,</HI> or <HI>Siciliane;</HI> a kind of &s;imple, rural mu&s;ic, performed by <HI>Abruzze&s;e,</HI> or Calabrian &s;hepherds, on a &s;pecies of bagpipes. The tunes vary according to the provinces. In the South, they have three different airs; the Northern &s;hepherds know only two; to which they add &s;uch variations, as their own genius in&s;pires. The boys learn of their fathers, to play on this in&s;trument, as the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. At other &s;ea&s;ons, it is rare, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> to hear any agreeable &s;ounds in the &s;treets of Naples, though it is the nur&s;ery of mu&s;ical profe&s;&s;ors. There is no &s;uch thing as a national mu&s;ic, unle&s;s we give that name to a monotanous, dralling &s;eguidilla, u&s;ed by the nur&s;es to lull children to &s;leep, and &s;eems borrowed from the Spaniards, who learnt it of the Moors.</P>
<P>They do not even dance to mu&s;ic, but perform the tarantella, which is a low dance; con&s;i&s;ting of turns on
<PB N="28" REF="28">
the heel, much footing and &s;napping of the fingers. Indeed, per&s;ons of all ranks here dance very low, but mark the time as perfectly with their &s;teps, as other nations do by &s;pringing from the ground. The taran|tella dance is the delight of their &s;oul, and a con&s;tant holiday diver&s;ion of the young women.</P>
<P>Bull-baiting is a common diver&s;ion; there is a large &s;quare at Naples, walled in for the purpo&s;e. Hunting is laid a&s;ide; but gentlemen, throughout the country, hunt hares, foxes, and &s;ometimes wild boars, with hounds, or lurchers, and &s;ometimes with both. In autumn, fowlers u&s;e nets, &s;pringes, or bird-lime, to take birds; and in winter, guns. All the country is free to tho&s;e who buy the king's licence, except &s;ome few enclo&s;ures, where the barons endeavour to pre&s;erve the game. A licence for fowling in the plains of Naples, with bird-calls, co&s;ts ten carlines a year; in the plains and woods, twenty-four, and &s;ixty with nets. At a di&s;tance from the capital, it is only four carlines. Calabria is too hilly for hunting, all game is brought down by the gun, or taken in nets.</P>
<P>The road, from Rome to Naples, is bad enough, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> and the inns wor&s;e. He travelled in 1765. Nothing but vermin and na&s;tine&s;s in their beds, on the Appian to Brindi&s;i; the road that <HI>Horace</HI> travelled has nothing in it de&s;irable. The &s;wampy &s;oil and
<PB N="29" REF="29">
mar&s;hes on the right; and the &s;tring of barren moun|tains on the left, for &s;cores of miles together, may amu&s;e, but cannot delight a traveller.</P>
<P>In travelling through the kingdom of Naples, and the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, an Engli&s;hman is &s;truck at the &s;carcity of villages and cottages; indeed, one may almo&s;t a&s;&s;ert, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> that there is no &s;uch thing as a village, or even a clu&s;ter of hou&s;es re&s;embling one. What &s;ingle, &s;eparate hou&s;es there are, you &s;ee at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the town; and, as the country is &s;o thinly inhabited, the towns &s;warm with inhabi|tants. If any of the&s;e labour in the fields, they mu&s;t travel far for that purpo&s;e; but there are multitudes of idle people, who wrap them&s;elves up in their cloaks, and &s;tand pen&s;ively and &s;tupid in the &s;treets, from morning to night. On holidays, every &s;oul is in this &s;auntering attitude.</P>
<P>The towns &s;tand on the &s;ummit of hills; and, at &s;ome di&s;tance, afford a plea&s;ant pro&s;pect, being built with &s;tone, and having flat roofs; but, when you enter within the walls, and &s;ee the hou&s;es &s;o offen&s;ively na&s;ty, and the windows not only without gla&s;s, but without &s;hutters; the marks of dirty poverty are &s;o &s;trong, as almo&s;t to turn the &s;tomach. Some of the inns, on this road, exceed in filth and bad accommoda|tions, every thing that can be conceived. I do &s;in|cerely
<PB N="30" REF="30">
believe, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> they no more think of wiping down a cobweb in a bedchamber, than our farmers do of &s;weeping them away in an old barn; and can declare, upon my honour, that was a &s;pider to fall from his man&s;ion, every gue&s;t would be liable to receive it in his face as he lies in bed, for the whole cieling is covered with them.</P>
<P>Between the Mediterranean &s;ea and the Adriatic, are many fore&s;ts, where robbers are &s;aid to be con|tinually lurking; and, as an e&s;cort, government has &s;tationed certain detachments of troopers, at proper di&s;tances, to take travellers and merchants under their protection.</P>
<P>In the months of February and March, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> who travelled it in 1730, a per&s;on mu&s;t be very ex|peditious to travel &s;even &s;tages in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, from &s;un-ri&s;ing to &s;un-&s;et; but, in &s;ummer, the &s;eventeen &s;tages and a half, between Rome and Naples, are ea&s;ily performed in two days. For the two chai&s;e-hor&s;es at every &s;tage, within the kingdom of Naples, we pay eleven carlines, (three &s;hillings and eightpence Eng|li&s;h) and half as much for the chai&s;e, if wanted. The goodne&s;s of the roads (this contradicts <HI>Sharp</HI>) the fer|tility of the country, and the vigour and &s;trength of the hor&s;es, make travelling extremely plea&s;ant in the Neapolitan territories. However, we cannot be too
<PB N="31" REF="31">
careful, that the louis d'ors, or Spani&s;h pi&s;toles, which a traveller brings into this country, be of right weight; for, both at Naples, and on the road, all gold coins are weighed with more cunning than equity, and need|le&s;s cavils rai&s;ed, to make them appear to be under weight.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of their Births, Education, Marriages, Phy&s;ic, Funerals, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Neapolitan people, &s;ays <HI>Bi&s;ani,</HI> are known by their di&s;po&s;ition to rebel. The pea&s;ants are vigorous, robu&s;t, &s;trong, mu&s;cular, full of fire, active, and very laborious; they re&s;emble the Italians only in &s;obriety. This race of men glory in their de&s;cent from the Greeks, whom they re&s;emble. The other cla&s;s of people are voluptuous to an exce&s;s.</P>
<P>Though the Neapolitan gentry are at a very &s;mall expence for their tables, keeping little or no com|pany;
<PB N="32" REF="32">
yet, upon weddings, lyings-inn, and funerals, they are very pompous. Lying-in ladies receive company, in great crowds, the day after their delivery; who, as &s;oon as their compliments are paid, retire to adjacent chambers, forming them&s;elves into card-parties, or <HI>converzationi,</HI> and are regaled with every dainty the confectioner can furni&s;h. The&s;e compli|ments are continued nine days.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Neapolitan grandee's hou&s;e, as has been ob&s;erved, is upon a very expen&s;ive plan. The number of &s;ervants, carriages, hor&s;es, and run|ning footmen, would &s;uffice for a &s;overeign prince; and the wardrobes of their wives is formed on the &s;ame magnificent &s;cale; yet, it is a fixed rule, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> that all ladies whatever, be the circum|&s;tances of their hu&s;bands affluent or circum&s;cribed, have an hundred ducats a month, and no more, al|lowed them for pin-money, (about &s;eventeen guineas Engli&s;h.) At the birth of every child, the hu&s;band makes the wife a pre&s;ent of an hundred ounces, and &s;ome valuable trinkets, according to his fortune. In the plains it is cu&s;tomary for a pea&s;ant, on the birth of a daughter, to plant a row of poplar-trees, which are cut down and &s;old, at the end of &s;eventeen years, to make up a fortune for her. The proverbial benediction of <HI>Figlij Ma&s;chi, i. e.</HI> male children, which a Neapoli|tan gives a woman when &s;he &s;neezes, is founded on
<PB N="33" REF="33">
the great facility with which the common people pro|vide for their &s;ons: as &s;oon as they can run about, they are able to earn their bread; while their &s;i&s;ters remain idle at home, or beg till they are old enough to attract the notice of the men.</P>
<P><HI>Swinburne</HI> &s;ays, that the Neapolitans have tears at command, and are very ea&s;ily moved to &s;hew them, that neither blows nor care&s;&s;es can &s;top their children when once they begin to cry; that they mu&s;t roar till they are tired; that all nur&s;es have a notion of &s;inging, a monotanous, drawling, <HI>&s;equidilla,</HI> by which they lull children to &s;leep; but that they provided again&s;t its wakeful influence, by &s;uch do&s;es of Venice treacle, as to render it a material article of im|portation.</P>
<P>Now I am &s;peaking of nur&s;es, it may not be ami&s;s to tell my readers, from Mrs. <HI>Piozzi,</HI> that it is a com|mon thing, for the wives of the lower cla&s;s of men, to &s;uckle the lap-dogs of ladies of quality; nay, many a woman of fa&s;hion has fuckled her own dog her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Education, &s;ays <HI>Martyn,</HI> has been little attended to. Few people of rank will &s;uffer their children to frequent academies, or public &s;chools, but keep them at home; where in this &s;oft climate they acquire
<PB N="34" REF="34">
indolence and effeminacy. All literary di&s;tinctions have been beneath their rank, and it was not thought expedient to cloud the playful innocence of childhood, or the amiable gaiety of youth, with &s;evere &s;tudy. The nobility of this country, very &s;eldom travel; and the only dramatic pieces here re|pre&s;ented, are operas; in which mu&s;ic, not &s;entiment, is the principal thing attended to. But, the pains and expence government has been at, in e&s;tabli&s;hing public &s;eminaries; the patriotic effects of the new academy of &s;ciences and belles lettres, and the fa&s;hion which begins to prevail, among the nobility, of vi&s;iting foreign countries; will, probably, bring on a gradual improvement.</P>
<P>Marriage-portions are not very great in general. It does not co&s;t a nobleman more to marry a daugh|ter, than it does to make her a nun; five thou&s;and pounds will not defray the expence of the ceremonies and profe&s;&s;ion; &s;he mu&s;t have a pen&s;ion &s;ettled on her; and re&s;erves, be&s;ides, a power over her inheri|tance, in ca&s;e &s;he arrives at any dignity in the con|vent, and wi&s;hes to enrich it with buildings, plate, or ve&s;tments.</P>
<P>Servants, and artificers of the city of Naples, give from fifty to an hundred ducats with their daughters. Pea&s;ants, and country workmen, go as far as three
<PB N="35" REF="35">
hundred. Females at, or near Naples, are e&s;teemed helple&s;s and indolent, and therefore have always twice or thrice as much fortune as their brothers, who have greater re&s;ources in their &s;trength and activity. A girl would &s;carce get a hu&s;band, if her lover did not expect to be re-imbur&s;ed, by her portion, for the &s;um he paid away with his own &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>In funeral ceremonies, it is u&s;ual to hire clergymen; who, having no patrimony, earn as much by their fees on the&s;e occa&s;ions, as pays for their ordination; but it is very common, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> for them to dre&s;s up the vagabonds of the &s;treets, in their clothes, and &s;end them to &s;ing and pray in their &s;tead. The&s;e fellows are always attended by a friend, who holds a paper bag with a taper in it, in which they make the taper &s;weal and wa&s;te as much as po&s;|&s;ible. At the burial of an archbi&s;hop of Naples, four hundred friars attended with wax lights; but &s;ome thieves let loo&s;e a mad ox among them; and, in the confu&s;ion, ran away with the candles. At another great funeral, a gang of rogues di&s;gui&s;ed them&s;elves like clerks and &s;acri&s;tans, and demanded from each a&s;&s;i&s;tant his taper, which they extingui&s;hed, and carried off with the utmo&s;t hypocritical compo|&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="36">The manner of burying their dead, here, is very &s;hocking to an Engli&s;hman. Their cu&s;tom is, to carry the corp&s;e, dre&s;t in his u&s;ual wearing apparel, with his face expo&s;ed, on an open bier, through the &s;treets to the church, where the &s;ervice is read; after which it is &s;tripped, and at a convenient hour, buried: but there is a pride and rivalry among the middling rank of people, in dre&s;&s;ing out their children for this exhibition, which is truly laughable. The other day, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> there pa&s;&s;ed under my window, the body of a boy about eight years old, who&s;e figure and face were as hideous, as death and the &s;mall-pox could make him. The parents had dre&s;&s;ed him in a fine laced hat, bag-wig, blue and &s;ilver cloaths, &amp;c. and above all things, they don't forget to &s;tick a &s;word by his &s;ide. The origin of this cu&s;tom I could not learn, but ap|prehend, continues this author, it was at fir&s;t de&s;igned to prevent foul play. The reality of every man's death, is even evident to the whole pari&s;h; and no young &s;pendthrift can &s;pirit away a father, or rich uncle, and fill a coffin with &s;tones, &s;end it to the grave, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Moore</HI> tells us, he met with a &s;imilar funeral proce&s;&s;ion. The decea&s;ed was a trade&s;man, who&s;e widow had be&s;towed, not only the utmo&s;t attention, but more than &s;he could afford, in dre&s;&s;ing him to the greate&s;t advantage on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion. He had

on quite a new &s;uit of clothes, a laced hat on his head, ruffles, his hair finely powdered, and a large blooming no&s;egay in his left-hand, while the right was very gracefully &s;tuck in his &s;ide.</P>
<P>It is the fa&s;hion to vi&s;it the widow, or neare&s;t re|lation of the decea&s;ed, the day after his, or her death; and this compliment of condolence is al&s;o paid, by every acquaintance, before the expiration of nine days.</P>

<P>NAPLES, by its &s;ituation and harbour, has always been the centre of a commerce, which it lies in its own brea&s;t to enlarge, and that very con&s;iderably; but, notwith&s;tanding its &s;ituation, and that no king|dom produces the nece&s;&s;aries and luxuries of life in greater profu&s;ion; yet trade is but in a langui&s;hing condition; the be&s;t &s;ilks come from Lyons; the be&s;t woollen goods from England.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="39">The following merchandize, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> is im|ported in Naples.</P>
<P>From <HI>England</HI>&mdash;Woollen goods of all &s;orts, &s;ilk and wor&s;ted &s;tockings, hats, tanned hides, lead, tin, pepper, hardware, linens, fans, canes, guns, dying-woods, drugs, watches, clocks, mathematical in&s;tru|ments, hou&s;ehold furniture, &s;alt-cod, pilchards, her|rings, coffee, tea, cocoa, &s;ugar, and occa&s;ionally cal|licoes, and Ea&s;t-India goods.</P>

<P>From <HI>France</HI>&mdash;Great quantities of &s;ugar, indigo, coffee, dying-woods, verdigrea&s;e, Levant drugs, cocoa, hardware, &s;ilk-&s;tuffs, gold and &s;ilver, &s;ags of le mans, du roy, cloths of Elbeuf, and all &s;orts of women's ap|parel.</P>
<P>From <HI>Spain</HI>&mdash;Sugar, cochineal, dying-woods, cocoa, hides &s;alted, and in the hair; American drugs, divers cloths, wine, tobacco, Seville and Havannah &s;nuff, lead, gun-barrels, honey, &amp;c.</P>
<P>From <HI>Portugal</HI>&mdash;Brazil &s;ugars, tobacco, cocoa of Maringan, drugs, hides, &amp;c.</P>

<P>The duties, on imports in general, are twenty-five per cent. on the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e valuation; &s;ugars and rum pay forty or fifty per cent. on the market price; the duty on &s;ugar produces, annually, about 80,000 ducats.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="41">The exports are, hemp, flax, goat's hair, &s;ilk, dried fruits, manna, hor&s;es, excellent &s;hip timber, and dif|ferent &s;orts of grain. In the city of Naples there are &s;everal manufactories of &s;ilk, velvets, velverets, handkerchiefs, and &s;tockings. Their &s;oap is much e&s;teemed. They al&s;o make liqueurs, e&s;&s;ences, artifi|cial flowers, and abundance of macaroni. The be&s;t mu&s;ical &s;trings are made here, from lambs-gut. There is a manufactory of tortoi&s;e-&s;hell, which they inlay oc|ca&s;ionally with gold, for &s;nuff-boxes, and other ar|ticles; and they carry on a con&s;iderable commerce in poli&s;hed marbles and lava's. They are thought to embroider here, better than in France; their maca|roni is preferred to any modern Italy; and they have one kind of confection called <HI>Diabolonis,</HI> a drug of a very hot and &s;timulating nature, &s;old at a very high price, four or five guineas for a handful.</P>
<P>The wines of Naples are the be&s;t in Italy, and the clergy are the greate&s;t wine-merchants. The wine-cellar, belonging to the Je&s;uits, if we may credit Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> is a va&s;t vault, that contains above a thou&s;and hog&s;heads. The people here, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, will drink no wine, or other liquors, not even water, if it has not been &s;ome time in &s;now, which they u&s;e in&s;tead of ice; affirming, that &s;now cools liquor &s;ooner; and, according to Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> a &s;carcity of &s;now would rai&s;e a mutiny at Naples, as &s;oon as a

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Of their Army and Navy, Con&s;titution, Revenue, Laws.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tanding forces, hor&s;e and foot, in time of peace, throughout the kingdom, do not exceed 27,000 men; of which 1,700 are foreigners; Swi&s;s, Italians, and Spaniards: a number very in&s;ufficient for keeping the inhabitants in awe, on the approach of an enemy. The officers, in the Neapolitan &s;ervice, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;ley,</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hed, from the en&s;ign to the colonel, by the heads of their canes. Their pay is &s;mall; a captain having but three hundred dollars a year. No officer can marry without the King's con|&s;ent, in order to prevent their marrying below their rank; and they &s;ay his Maje&s;ty is very &s;trict in his enquiries, before he grants the lady the reque&s;t; for it is &s;he that mu&s;t a&s;k the permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiers &s;eem di&s;&s;atisfied with their &s;ituation, and are always complaining of their hard&s;hips; but this is of little moment, the frontiers being too well
<PB N="44" REF="44">
&s;ecured for any of them to e&s;cape. One act of hu|manity, however, in their government, de&s;erves notice; that on de&s;erters being brought back to their corps, they are only impri&s;oned, and fed on bread and water for a few days; for the &s;econd offence, the puni&s;hment is heavier, but never death.</P>
<P>Among their regiments there is a corps of light in|fantry, armed and dre&s;t after the fa&s;hion of the Cata|lonian miquelets. Their uniform is yellow; their accoutrements light, and fit for de&s;ultory attacks; their per&s;ons well cho&s;en, and proper for the duty. This regiment is called <HI>Fucilieii di Compagna,</HI> country fuzileers, and their office is to patrole the roads, and e&s;cort travellers from place to place.</P>
<P>The King has a fleet, as hath been ob&s;erved, of armed gallies, and a few men of war, but unworthy the name of a fleet; &s;o that the &s;tate is not &s;ecure from the bombardment of a naval force. The whole navy of the kingdom, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> may be &s;een in the port of Naples; for, as magnificent as it may appear to an Engli&s;hman, it is much larger than they have any u&s;e for. The only purpo&s;e for which they em|ploy their &s;hips of war, and frigates, is a crui&s;e again&s;t the Barbary rovers, and this happens but rarely. They &s;eem, at la&s;t, to have di&s;covered, that gallies are but a poor defence again&s;t frigates, and &s;uch as
<PB N="45" REF="45">
Engli&s;h privateers; for which rea&s;on, they never fit them out for &s;ea, but re&s;erve them merely as pri&s;ons. The following was a true li&s;t of their fleet in 1766. Two men of war, one of 64 guns, and the other of 54; two frigates of 32 guns each; four gallies, four gal|liots, and &s;ix xebecks; a formidable army again&s;t Lil|liput, or their neighbouring potentate the pope.</P>
<P>As the nobility hold their lands by feudal tenure, and were obliged to furni&s;h a certain number of &s;ol|diers, it was formerly calculated, that they could bring into the field 100,000 hor&s;e, and 150,000 foot; but mo&s;t of the&s;e military &s;ervices are now turned into rents; and the &s;overeign chu&s;es to rely rather upon foreign troops, than his own people.</P>
<P>The title of King of both Sicilies was fir&s;t u&s;ed in the twelfth century, when <HI>Roger</HI> II. earl of Sicily, was al&s;o king of Naples. The title of inve&s;titure, which the pope claims for the kingdom, commenced in the eleventh century, when pope <HI>Leo</HI> IX. inve&s;ted count <HI>Humphrey,</HI> the Norman, and his heirs, with Apulia, Ca|labria, and whatever he &s;hould conquer in Sicily. Though this inve&s;titure meant no more, than that the pope wi&s;hed &s;ucce&s;s to the Norman arms, and pro|nounced their future conque&s;ts lawful; yet, in 1059, it was made more ab&s;olute, and the province of the kingdom of Naples, was con&s;idered as fiefs to the
<PB N="46" REF="46">
popedom. The pope now accepts the city of Bene|vento, from the King of Naples, for the inve&s;titure; and &s;ends to Naples annually, a pre&s;ent of a white palfrey, and a pur&s;e of &s;ix thou&s;and ducats. The King's elde&s;t &s;on is &s;tiled prince of Calabria. The arms of the kingdom is a blue field, inter&s;per&s;ed with lilies; or, with a tournament collar of five lappets gules.</P>
<P>Here is one order, that of St. <HI>Januarius,</HI> in&s;tituted in 1728. Its badge is an image of that &s;aint, appen|dant to a watered carnation ribband hanging from the right &s;houlder to the left &s;ide, and on the left brea&s;t a &s;ilver cro&s;s.</P>
<P>The nobility are numerous, too much &s;o for the extent of the kingdom. There are 119 princes, 156 dukes, 173 marqui&s;&s;es, 42 counts, and 445 barons; all va&s;&s;als of the crown. Many a &s;pot of land, not worth fifty dollars a year, gives the title of marquis to the owners; &s;o that, in general, they are very poor.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Naples is &s;till governed by laws, which the Normans introduced in the eleventh cen|tury, viz. the annual feudal law in all its origin; a proof of its former conque&s;t by the Normans. The pea&s;ants, of cour&s;e, are poor; and it depends entirely
<PB N="47" REF="47">
on the per&s;onal character of the ma&s;ters, whether their poverty is not the lea&s;t of their grievances. The court of Naples has not yet ventured, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> by one open act of authority, to aboli&s;h the immediate power of the lords over their tenants; but, it is be|lieved, the mini&s;ter wi&s;hes &s;ecretly for its de&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P>Though the Neapolitan nobility &s;till retain, as I &s;aid, the ancient feudal authority over the pea&s;ants; yet their per&s;onal importance depends, in a great mea&s;ure, on the favour of the king; who, under pre|text of any offence, can confine them to their own e&s;tates, or impri&s;on them at plea&s;ure; or, which is wor&s;e to them, can forbid them the court. Unle&s;s the king was to affront all the nobility at once, he has little to fear from their re&s;entment. Even in ca&s;e of &s;uch a union, as the nobles have lo&s;t the affection and attachment of their pea&s;ants; what could they do, in oppo&s;ition to a &s;tanding army of 30,000 men, (&s;ome of whom are Swi&s;s) entirely devoted to the crown?</P>
<P>There are a number of &s;tate officers in the &s;ervice of the crown; but men of high birth are &s;eldom here called to the management of public affairs; of cour&s;e, they live a great deal upon their e&s;tates, and the&s;e &s;ave money, to make a figure occa&s;ionally at Naples. The country &s;eats, of the nobility, are ca&s;tles; with a
<PB N="48" REF="48">
&s;ingle wall, or ditch about them, like the gentlemen's chateaus, or &s;eats, in Flanders; &s;ufficient to &s;ecure them again&s;t a troop of banditti, but by no means ca|pable of re&s;i&s;ting an army.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI> &s;ays, the clergy are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one-third of the lands of the whole kingdom; the crown, nobility, and gentry, po&s;&s;e&s;s almo&s;t all the re&s;t. Trade&s;|men and pea&s;ants have &s;carce any they can call their own; being no better than tenants at will. They manure the lord's lands, plant and prune his vines and olives, and are allowed no more than a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;t|tance for their poor families. They come for ju&s;tice to the courts of their re&s;pective lords, in all ca&s;es that are not capital, or highly criminal; and are, in all re&s;pects, &s;ubject to the&s;e petty &s;overeigns. As the crown lands pay no taxes, and tho&s;e of the clergy none, but what they think proper; the charges of go|vernment are born chiefly by the nobility and gentry.</P>
<P>The revenues of the Crown amount to about one million &s;terling per year; and ari&s;e from the mono|poly of &s;alt, gunpowder, and from exci&s;e and different taxes, ports-royal, and an annual free gift of the no|bility, clergy, and feudal &s;tates. But there is not above eight or nine millions of ducats, current coin, in the kingdom; including gold, &s;ilver, and bra&s;s; which is
<PB N="49" REF="49">
not &s;ufficient for the circulation of a very exten&s;ive commerce; for, although the notes of &s;even public banks, e&s;tabli&s;hed in Naples, circulate even down to the value of the &s;malle&s;t &s;ums; yet the ca&s;h for the&s;e notes is paid into the&s;e banks, as into bankers hands in London, and without intere&s;t; of cour&s;e, this paper money does not increa&s;e the quantity of &s;pecie circulated, it only &s;aves trouble. The&s;e banks take in pawns to an immen&s;e value, at &s;tated intere&s;ts, and lend money on other &s;ecurities.</P>
<P>All manufactures &s;ent from the capital into the pro|vinces, and exported out of the kingdom, are liable to a duty of &s;ixteen to twenty per cent. and the&s;e duties ari&s;e annually to 74909 ducats&mdash;a ducat is 3s. 4d. &s;terling.</P>
<P>There is a great &s;carcity of gold, but much &s;ilver, and va&s;t quantities of copper coin in circulation. Gold is &s;o &s;carce, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> that I have &s;een five or &s;ix gentlemen, not choo&s;ing to carry a load of &s;ilver, &s;it down to cards, and be under the nece&s;&s;ity of mark|ing their lo&s;ings. On the contrary, there is &s;uch a profu&s;ion of copper, and retail taaders are overloaded with it to &s;uch a degree, as to oblige them to make a certain allowance for the exchange. In con&s;equence of this nece&s;&s;ity, we &s;ee, in the market-places and &s;treets, great numbers of money-changers, who have a
<PB N="50" REF="50">
little &s;tall heaped up with copper money, which they deliver out for &s;ilver to tho&s;e who want change; and they receive of the &s;hopkeepers, about a halfpenny for every four &s;hillings worth.</P>
<P>The feudal &s;y&s;tem is here in its full force, it begins with the per&s;on of the king, and extends it&s;elf through all cla&s;&s;es. The kingdom of Naples is a fief to the holy &s;ee of Rome; but, &s;ince the year 1788, the King has not paid his homage. Many of the fiefs in the two Sicilies, are in the hands of the Venetians, and the Genoe&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;overeign authority is not unlimited; it is in &s;ome mea&s;ure curbed, by the &s;tates of the kingdom, who a&s;&s;emble annually. There are &s;ix thou&s;and noble families in the kingdom of Naples only, the great dignities are as numerous as in Spain; and in every town there are inferior juri&s;dictions. Ju&s;tice is admini&s;tered by upper tribunals, in every province, with an appeal to the great court in Naples; even from Sicily it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The forms of criminal juri&s;prudence are here &s;o ill ordained, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> &s;o multiplied, and &s;o com|plex; that, if the king was to in&s;i&s;t upon a villain's taken in the fact being tried, and if found guilty, hanged before the end of three days; the di&s;patch
<PB N="51" REF="51">
would almo&s;t kill the judges with fatigue; for the trial and procedures would employ them full eighteen hours out of every twenty-four. Fir&s;t, the accu&s;a|tion mu&s;t be laid according to rule, and witne&s;&s;es examined; next, the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner pleads a couple of hours; the coun&s;el for the crown one hour; then the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner, if he plea&s;es, two hours more. This done, every one of the judges harangues. Then all the notifications are made, exa|minations canva&s;&s;ed, proofs debated, and a thou&s;and trifling formalities ob&s;erved, which occa&s;ion &s;uch &s;hameful, un&s;urmountable delays, as eterni&s;e a cri|minal proce&s;s. It happened lately, continues <HI>Swin|burne,</HI> that on the final determination of the trial, and condemnation of a malefactor, a me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent to the jailer, to bring the culprit into court, in order to receive &s;entence; when behold! the turnkey appeared, and made an affidavit, that the pri&s;oner had died of a long fit of &s;ickne&s;s, the Chri&s;tmas twelvemonth before.</P>
<P>As the &s;alary of a judge, in Naples, is only fifty ducats a month (9l. 7s. 6d. Engli&s;h) he cannot afford to be hone&s;t, or expeditious; but the ca&s;e is &s;till wor&s;e in the provinces, where the judges have but half the &s;um; and with that mu&s;t keep a coach, and proper hou&s;ehold e&s;tabli&s;hment. Tho&s;e who &s;erve warrants, writs, &amp;c. are allowed no pay, though they mu&s;t keep thirty bailiffs each under them; of cour&s;e, they
<PB N="52" REF="52">
are naturally very active in taking up an offender, where there is a po&s;&s;ibility of extorting any money out of him; when once in durance, the pri&s;oner cea&s;es to be an object of con&s;ideration to them, and therefore they take no pains to forward his trial. There were above twelve thou&s;and criminals, rotting in the diffe|rent pri&s;ons of the kingdom, when Mr. <HI>Swinburne</HI> was there, who&s;e maintenance co&s;t the &s;tate above two hundred thou&s;and ducats a year, (37,500l.).</P>
<P>The plaintiff and defendant are not brought, face to face, before a judge; but the cau&s;e is brought on by an attorney, on the part of each; one &s;tates the accu&s;a|tion, the other the defence; after this, the judges, by a plurality of voices, determine according to the evi|dence; of cour&s;e the delays of criminal cau&s;es, be|come as tedious as tho&s;e of civil ones.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners, condemned to the galleys, of which there are generally about two thou&s;and, are chained two and two, and may be thought to &s;uffer by lying on the decks; but their condition is far preferable to that of many of the poor, who lie in the &s;treets. Be|&s;ides, they have a certain allowance of bread from the king, and wear &s;ome cloathing. The galley &s;laves lead an idle life; whatever work they do a-board, is chiefly for their own benefit; for few of them are em|ployed in crui&s;ing. If a taylor, or a &s;hoemaker, earns
<PB N="53" REF="53">
a few pence, he puts a part of it into his pocket, and purcha&s;es &s;ome rarity with it. A man, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> who has vi&s;ited them as often as I have done, will never, when he means to picture extreme mi&s;ery, re|pre&s;ent it in the &s;hape of a galley-&s;lave. I have &s;een a mu&s;ician, on board, entertaining them with vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic, whom they paid for his performance; and I have no doubt, but this poor man &s;tiled tho&s;e we call wretches, his good ma&s;ters.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP XV.</HI> Of their Religion.</HEAD>
<P>THE Roman Catholic religion, here, is on a very bad footing; and the be&s;t that can be &s;aid of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution is, that the Neapolitans have always re&s;olutely oppo&s;ed the introducing of the in|qui&s;ition. The number of mona&s;teries and convents is a&s;toni&s;hing; and the clergy may be &s;aid to be all wealthy, but the laity, poor. We have &s;aid, that
<PB N="54" REF="54">
the clergy po&s;&s;e&s;s a third of the kingdom; but <HI>Gian|none,</HI> who wrote with &s;uch veracity and freedom, on the ambition of avarice, of the Neapolitan clergy, and thereby involved him&s;elf in misfortunes, men|tions, as a general received opinion, that were the country divided into five parts, four would be found in the hands of the church, as being in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of half the land; and having, upon an average, pro|cured by legacies and donations, a fifth, and a half-fifth more; &s;carce a per&s;on dying, without leaving &s;ome|thing to a church, or a convent. Indeed, &s;uch is the power and opulence of the clergy, of this country, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> and the veneration paid them, that more than once they have been ready to &s;eize the civil power. The laity have often, in the &s;tronge&s;t man|ner, petitioned their &s;overeign, that the clergy &s;hould be no longer allowed to purcha&s;e lands; but all en|deavours were fruitle&s;s, till 1751, when mea&s;ures were invented, for the pope's con&s;ent, for le&s;&s;ening the num|ber of convents.</P>
<P>As to external ceremonies, the devotion of the Roman Catholics, here, is not &s;o outrageous as in &s;everal provinces of Germany. At the elevation of the ho&s;t, in churches, prote&s;tants are not compelled to kneel; and travellers are allowed to eat fle&s;h in Lent. In this kingdom are twenty-one archbi&s;hopricks, and one hundred and twenty-three bi&s;hopricks; in 1782,
<PB N="55" REF="55">
the kingdom of Naples, alone, contained 45,525 prie&s;ts; 24,694 monks, and 20,973 nuns: the ab|beys, priories, commendaries, in the two kingdoms, are very rich, and amount to one hundred and twenty.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t common proce&s;&s;ion, which is exhibited almo&s;t every day, is not &s;o much intended to create devotion, as to rai&s;e a fund for penitent pro&s;titutes; who have quitted their abandoned way of living, and retired to a convent. In order the more effectually to move the &s;pectator to charity, the younge&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful of the&s;e penitents are &s;elected, who are ordered to walk bare-footed, through the city, two a-brea&s;t. At &s;ome particular places they kneel down, acknowledge their pa&s;t wickedne&s;s, and &s;ing peniten|tial hymns; the eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and a lay a&s;&s;i&s;tant, who at|tend them, in the mean time, receiving the contribu|tions of the public, in a pur&s;e fa&s;tened to the end of a &s;tick. Their habit, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, is a violet coloured gown, tied round the wai&s;t with a cord of the &s;ame colour. Their heads are &s;haved, but they wear a blue veil, which, however, is thin enough to give a &s;ight of the charms of youth and beauty, as powerful incentives to a liberal contribution.</P>
<P>The Neapolitans have a tendency to Athei&s;m, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler. Molines</HI> had a &s;trong party in this city;
<PB N="56" REF="56">
and many, in their heart, are Jan&s;eni&s;ts. Naples is the place, of all Italy, where book&s;ellers are under the lea&s;t re&s;traint; books written by Prote&s;tants are openly &s;old.</P>
<P>At Naples they have a practice, unknown at Rome; and which is meant as a piece of devotional compli|ment to the Saviour of the world. From the Friday to the Sunday, inclu&s;ive, which three days our Lord remained interred in the earth, per&s;ons of quality vi&s;it in chairs; and tho&s;e of inferior rank, walk. No carriages are allowed at that time to pa&s;s the &s;treets; left, by their clatter, they &s;hould di&s;turb our Saviour in his grave. I &s;peak not this ludicrou&s;ly, &s;ays <HI>Sharp;</HI> there are thou&s;ands who believe him at this time in the bowels of the earth.</P>
<P>Among other ridiculous practices which are meant as &s;acred ones in the holy week; they fa&s;ten a man on a cro&s;s, and carry him in proce&s;&s;ion through the &s;treets of Naples. On each &s;ide of the cro&s;s are two vulgar women, who, with their hair di&s;hevelled, and &s;ome ge&s;tures of lamentation, repre&s;ent <HI>Mary,</HI> and <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> in tears. The man, who repre&s;ents our Sa|viour, is &s;ome poor fellow, who is paid a &s;hilling or two for his trouble; the exten&s;ion of his arms, for a length of time, being very unea&s;y and painful to him.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="57">They have even admitted into their devotion, the noi&s;e and explo&s;ion of gunpowder. I was rou&s;ed one day from my &s;eat, continues <HI>Sharp,</HI> by a univer&s;al di&s;|charge of the whole artillery of Naples; and on en|quiry, was informed the guns were fired for the im|maculate conception of the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI> In truth, the Neapolitans are the greate&s;t gunpowder nation in the world. No merchant &s;ends a few ca&s;ks of wine into the city, but they are preceded by &s;quibs, crackers, and the firing of mu&s;quets; and, during the Chri&s;tmas week, all the young men, boys, and little children, &s;pend every farthing they can &s;crape toge|ther, in gunpowder; and pop and &s;hoot all day, and all night, to the great annoyance of the healthy, and the di&s;turbance of the &s;ick.</P>
<P>One of the greate&s;t &s;ingularities of Naples, at Chri&s;t|mas, is the <HI>Pre&s;epe;</HI> which is a repre&s;entation of the birth of our Saviour, with all its concomitant circum|&s;tances, in &s;mall figures. It is expo&s;ed either in a &s;uite of apartments, or on the flat top of a hou&s;e; and, by means of ma&s;&s;es, popes, cork, and branches of trees, form an hi&s;torical land&s;cape. Some of the&s;e <HI>pre&s;epes</HI> are pretty enough; they contrive to make the &s;ky, and di&s;tant country, a part of it; and optical illu&s;ions are wonderful.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="58">The <HI>pre&s;epe,</HI> or <HI>pre&s;epio,</HI> properly &s;ignifies a manger; and this is a dedication of the pre&s;epio to the virgin and her infant; not only in churches, but in hou&s;es. Among the puppets exhibited, we often &s;ee the wi&s;e men of the Ea&s;t, with the &s;tar over their heads, on one &s;pot; the &s;hepherds attending their flocks, with the angel de&s;cending towards them, on another. The Virgin, the Infant, <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> and the a&s;s, on another. In &s;hort, the compo&s;er introduces &s;uch figures and hi&s;to|rical facts into the group, as the new Te&s;tament, and &s;ometimes his own fancy, &s;ugge&s;ts. But what renders this made-picture really an object, for a man of ta&s;te, is the artful di&s;po&s;ition of the figures, amid&s;t a &s;cenery of per&s;pective a&s;toni&s;hingly deceitful to the eye. The&s;e are often made at a very great expence, from five hundred to as many thou&s;and pounds, and are always kept up. The poor, if they are not already provided with a pre&s;epio, purcha&s;e a cheap trumpery one at Chri&s;tmas, which they lock up with care the whole year; or, perhaps, for their lives.</P>
<P>In time of Lent, fine preachers, from every monk|ery, travel to di&s;tant provinces to hold forth to the public; and Naples is generally vi&s;ited by &s;ome of the be&s;t. Mr. <HI>Sharp</HI> tells us, he was induced to go and hear one or two of them, that were in the highe&s;t e&s;ti|mation for their eloquence. Some of the pulpits are a kind of gallery, which admit of great &s;cope for ac|tion,
<PB N="59" REF="59">
running from one end to the other; and inju|dicious preachers do not fail to take advantage of it. It is the habit of this country, to employ much action and ge&s;tures, in the mo&s;t trifling conver&s;ations. This habit infe&s;ts the bar and the pulpit; and from an in|di&s;criminate application of it, on &s;light occa&s;ions, its force and effect are lo&s;t in great ones.</P>
<P>But what gives more offence, is a familiarity of &s;tyle, which they have introduced into their compo&s;itions; when even God Almighty, and our Saviour, are the &s;ubjects in que&s;tion. I went the other day, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> when the mo&s;t celebrated preacher was in Naples; this was in 1766; who, among other inelegancies, gave us a familiar dialogue, and in a very familiar manner, betwixt God and <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in which our Saviour begged and prayed that he would not damn mankind; but God being inexorable, and deaf to all intreaty, our Saviour &s;aid, "Why then, if your ju&s;tice mu&s;t exceed your mercy, be &s;o good to damn <HI>me,</HI> and &s;pare <HI>them.</HI> This the preacher told us, God was <HI>&s;o good</HI> as to comply with. I believe, continues <HI>Sharp,</HI> I have not mi&s;taken him a jot; becau&s;e ano|ther gentleman, who was pre&s;ent, agreed with me in every particular, word for word; and I was &s;o fearful of mi&s;repre&s;enting the truth, that I immediately com|mitted it to paper.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="60">There has crept al&s;o into fa&s;hion, an idle cu&s;tom of telling a &s;tory in their &s;ermons; with which they &s;ome|times fini&s;h their di&s;cour&s;e, as our clergy do with a practical inference. They mean, that the moral of their &s;tories &s;hould be a religious one; but their at|tempts to tell, in the character of a man of the world, often mi&s;carries. A certain Catholic lady, continues this author, informed me, that la&s;t year &s;he was at church, when a celebrated Je&s;uit told the following &s;tory: "That queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> &s;o famous throughout the world for her here&s;y, made a compact with the devil, that if he would indulge her in all &s;he de&s;ired, and &s;uffer her to reign &s;o many years, &s;he would &s;ur|render her &s;oul at the conclu&s;ion of that term." Ac|cordingly, the day &s;he died, there was a great black cloud a&s;cended from the Thames, which drew the at|tention of an infinite number of &s;pectators; who, at la&s;t, heard a voice from the cloud pronounce the&s;e words: <HI>I am the &s;oul of queen</HI> Elizabeth, <HI>now going to the devil for the &s;ins I have committed.</HI> There is one week in Lent, that mo&s;t of the ladies of di&s;tinction go, every day, to hear a &s;ermon at the Je&s;uit's church; and it was on one of tho&s;e days that the preacher told this &s;tory to the polite&s;t congregation at Naples.</P>
<P>The preachers here have a moveable crucifix in the pulpit, about two feet high, &s;tanding clo&s;e to their elbow. The <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> on it has generally a crown of
<PB N="61" REF="61">
thorns; and the &s;tream of blood, down his face and brea&s;t, are painted with a lively red. At the con|clu&s;ion of the &s;ermon, or on any other appo&s;ite occa|&s;ion, when the preacher is to &s;et forth the &s;ufferings and agonies of our Saviour, dying for the &s;alvation of the world, he takes the crucifix in his hands, di&s;plays the bleeding wounds of the image; and, if he has any pathetic powers, never fails to extort &s;uch marks of contrition and horror from the congregation, &s;uch knockings on the brea&s;t, &s;uch an effu&s;ion of tears, and &s;ometimes, among&s;t the women, &s;uch involuntary hy&s;|terical &s;creams, as Prote&s;tants have no idea of.</P>
<P>But powerful as the crucifix u&s;ually is, particu|larly in the hands of an eloquent preacher, I am tempted, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> to tell a ludicrious &s;tory, border|ing upon prophanene&s;s, where its efficacy failed. It is one of tho&s;e in&s;tances, where a burning zeal, through a deplorable ignorance, furni&s;hes matters of raillery to &s;coffers, and compa&s;&s;ion to &s;uch as are truly reli|gious. At Naples, there is a place called <HI>Largo del Ca&s;tello,</HI> not unlike our Tower-hill, the re&s;ort of the idle. Here, every afternoon, monks, mountebanks, pickpockets, and conjurors, follow their &s;everal occu|pations. The monk, (for I never &s;aw more than one at a time) holds forth like our itinerant field-preachers, to what congregation he can collect. The moun|tebank, by means of punch, and his fellow come|dians,
<PB N="62" REF="62">
endeavours to gather as great an audience as <HI>he</HI> can. It happened one day, that punch &s;ucceeded wonderfully, and the poor monk preached to the air, for not a living creature was near him. Mortified and provoked, that a puppet-&s;hew, within thirty yards of him, &s;hould draw the attention of the people from the go&s;pel, to &s;uch idle tra&s;h; with a mixture of rage and religion, he held up his crucifix and called aloud, <HI>"Ecco il vero pulcinella."</HI> "Here is the true pul|chinello; come here&mdash;come here." This &s;tory is &s;o well known in Naples to be true, that the mo&s;t devout people tell it; and were it not for &s;uch a &s;anction, I &s;hould not have repeated it.</P>
<P>To be more &s;erious, Mrs. <HI>Piozzi</HI> tells us, that &s;he &s;aw a very odd &s;cene one morning at church; which, though new to her, perhaps, from its frequent repe|tition, &s;eemed to &s;trike no one but her&s;elf.</P>
<P>A lady, with a long white dre&s;s, and veiled, came in her carriage, which waited for her at the door, with her own arms on it; and three &s;ervants, better dre&s;&s;ed than is here common, followed and put a lighted taper in her hand. <HI>En cet et&acirc;t,</HI> &s;he moved &s;lowly up the church, looking like <HI>Jane Shore,</HI> in the la&s;t act, but not &s;o feeble; and, having reached the &s;teps of the high altar, threw her&s;elf quite upon her face before it; remaining there pro&s;trate, at lea&s;t five minutes, in
<PB N="63" REF="63">
the face of the whole congregation; who neither &s;tared, &s;neered, &s;miled, nor lamented; but minded their own private devotions (no ma&s;s was &s;aying). The lady ro&s;e, ki&s;&s;ed the &s;teps, and bathed them with her tears, mingled with &s;obs of an affected penitence; this done, &s;he retired to her &s;eat, where &s;he waited with others, the commencement of the &s;acred office.</P>
<P>Let not this &s;tory, however, continues our fair authore&s;s, lead any one to think, that more general decorum, or true devotion, can be found in churches of the Romi&s;h per&s;ua&s;ion, than in ours&mdash;quite the re|ver&s;e. This bur&s;t of penitential piety was, in it&s;elf, an indecorous thing; but it is the nature and genius of the people, not to mind pretenders. Dogs are &s;uffered to run about and dirty the churches, during the whole time of &s;ervice; whil&s;t the crying of children, and the mo&s;t indecent methods taken by the women to pacify them, give one &s;till ju&s;ter offence. In all the churches of Italy, there is no treading for &s;pittle and na&s;tine&s;s, but more &s;o at Naples.</P>
<P>I will conclude the&s;e anecdotes of their religion, with the cu&s;tomary miracle of the liquefaction of the blood of St. <HI>Januarius,</HI> their patron &s;aint, which is kept in two different phials (one holding near an ounce, and the other a few drops) in one of the chapels of the church, dedicated to that &s;aint. Both the
<PB N="64" REF="64">
phials re&s;emble the ladies' &s;melling bottles for &s;alts; the larger being a depre&s;&s;ed &s;pheroid, like a flat watch-ca&s;e, of three inches diameter, with gla&s;&s;es before and behind; the &s;maller, a narrow cylindrical one. They are contained in a gold ca&s;e, between two circular gla&s;&s;es, of about three inches diameter, &s;upported on a thin pede&s;tal; by which means, when it is held up again&s;t light, or a candle placed behind, the &s;pectator &s;ees clearly the bottles, and their contents; which &s;eems to be a congealed &s;ub&s;tance, not unlike a lump of Spani&s;h &s;nuff. <HI>Key&s;ler</HI> &s;ays, it is of a browni&s;h red, and looks like bal&s;am of Peru, which may be very ea&s;ily liquified. The pretended liquefaction of the coagulated blood in the phials, when placed near the head, is known to all the world. This farce is acted the fir&s;t Sunday in May; and on the &s;ucce&s;s, or failure of this miracle, the pro&s;perity, or calamity of the &s;uc|ceeding year, is &s;uppo&s;ed to depend. As its &s;ucce&s;s, that is, its liquefaction, occa&s;ions great rejoicings; &s;o, if the blood remains coagulated, recour&s;e is had to proce&s;&s;ions, and public flagellations, &amp;c. to avert the impending danger.</P>
<P>On the day when this miracle is to be exhibited, the phials, containing the blood, &s;tand &s;urrounded with a great number of lights. They are applied to the mouths and foreheads of an innumerable multitude of people, who throng to partake of &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing;
<PB N="65" REF="65">
the prie&s;t all the while burning it every way; &s;o that, by the continual agitation, the warmth of his hands, the heat from the lights, the effluvia from the crowd, the &s;ultrine&s;s of the weather, &amp;c. it is not unrea&s;on|able to &s;uppo&s;e, a conden&s;ed fluid, may be gradually re&s;tored to its liquid &s;tate. This operation, <HI>Sharp</HI> &s;ays, is generally executed in eight, ten, fifteen, or twenty minutes; but when he was pre&s;ent, it was near an hour and half, it being a very cold morning. Some hereticks, finding how &s;lowly the miracle ope|rated, thought proper to retire, to &s;ave their bones from being broke; for the Neapolitans entertain an opinion, that the &s;aint refu&s;es to act when hereticks are pre&s;ent; and as the refu&s;al is e&s;teemed ominous, they have, &s;ometimes, drove them very rudely from the altar. I heard, continues he, a woman declare, that it mu&s;t be owing to the pre&s;ence of &s;ome Pro|te&s;tants in the churches, that the miracle went on &s;o &s;lowly. The liquefaction in the larger phial was evi|dent; in the &s;maller, the matter, after the miracle, appeared of a more vivid red. I cannot &s;ay it re|&s;embled blood very much in either of them. As &s;oon as the liquefaction takes place, the prie&s;ts cry out, <HI>Il miraculo e fatto.</HI> "The miracle is done," which is immediately an&s;wered by a <HI>Te Deum,</HI> amid the accla|mations of the people, and a di&s;charge of cannon. In 1733, Mr. <HI>Neuman,</HI> a celebrated chemi&s;t at Berlin, invented a method to liquefy coagulated blood ea&s;ily,
<PB N="66" REF="66">
at any time; &s;o that, admitting the contents of the phial to be blood, (which mo&s;t likely is not the ca&s;e) there is nothing wonderful in the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> Of their Learning, Arts, Sciences, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Neapolitans are far from being deficient in under&s;tanding; but, notwith&s;tanding all their &s;chools, univer&s;ities, and academies, their religion mu&s;t be a perpetual bar to the improvement and in|crea&s;e of &s;olid literature. Though the book&s;ellers in Naples enjoy more liberty than in other Italian &s;tates; yet they are under very mortifying re&s;trictions, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> with regard to the publication and vending of books.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> who would not allow the clergy of Naples any great &s;hare of learning, ob&s;erves, however, that there were &s;ocieties of men in this city, of finer
<PB N="67" REF="67">
thoughts, than could be found in any other part of Italy.</P>
<P>At Naples, there is a univer&s;ity; &s;everal public li|braries, and profe&s;&s;ors, read lectures here on theology, medicine, politics, law, mathematics, phy&s;ics, hi&s;tory, humanity, and languages. In the two kingdoms, there are four univer&s;ities, and many academies of &s;cience, mu&s;ic, &s;culpture, and architecture.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the arts, Naples has been infinitely more happy in painting, than in architects. <HI>Lanfranc, Diminichini, Guido,</HI> and of the Bologna &s;chool; <HI>Lucca Giordano,</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;imo.</HI></P>
<P>The architecture of both &s;acred and civil, public and private edifices, is no longer the architecture of Rome; the out&s;ide of mo&s;t of the churches, even the mo&s;t &s;tately and &s;plendid, is, all over Italy, only a bare wall &s;tanding, as it were, in expectation of a portal. Their churches are ill built, in the form of a cup, with a cupola over the junction; all their gates and doors are loaded with heavy balconies, &s;upported by brackets, heavier than what they bear, or &s;u&s;pended by a miracle. The in&s;ides are rather rich and glaring, than fine; and the decorations and di&s;tributions every where uniform.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="68">The fountains, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;ley,</HI> in the &s;everal parts of the city, bear the marks of the &s;ame bad ta&s;te; but no where does Neapolitan ta&s;te &s;hine with &s;o much lu&s;tre, as in the pyramids or obeli&s;ks, erected in &s;quares fronting the principal churches. In the mon&s;trous expence of them, in the uncouth a&s;&s;emblage of the various marbles, they exceed all the enormities of Gothic rudene&s;s.</P>
<P>It is univer&s;ally known, that Naples is the centre of the be&s;t mu&s;ic in Italy, and the <HI>non plus ultra</HI> in exe|cution. It is to all Italy, in mu&s;ic, what Athens was to Greece, in eloquence and philo&s;ophy; but its mu&s;ic, like other arts, &s;avours a little of the national fondne&s;s for the <HI>Capriccio&s;o</HI> and the <HI>Stravagante.</HI></P>
<P>Naples has, for a long time, been the &s;chool and &s;eminary of the be&s;t violins; yet, they que&s;tion their &s;kill, till they have been tried by the renowned <HI>Tartini,</HI> of Padua, where they flock to covet his approbation. <HI>Tartini</HI> cooly hears them; and after very attentively li&s;tening to what they propo&s;e to execute, "That's fine," &s;ays he, or, "that is very difficult; that is brilliantly executed," "but," adds he, putting his finger to his brea&s;t, "It did not reach hither."</P>
<P>The &s;tudy of mu&s;ic is &s;o much neglected, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> at Naples, that I found it as impo&s;&s;ible here
<PB N="69" REF="69">
as at Venice, to have a harp&s;ichord to play on; nor do they ever print their operas or favourite airs.</P>
<P>The Italians count their hours to twenty-four o'clock, beginning the day from the time it is almo&s;t dark; &s;o that time varies with them, in conformity to the &s;etting of the &s;un. For example, if they begin to count from our &s;ix-in the evening; when it is &s;even with us, it will be one with them; and the next day, when it is &s;even in the evening, it will be a little pa&s;t one with them; as many minutes as the day is length|ened, To obviate, therefore, this error in time, they alter their clocks and watches, as often as the error amounts to fifteen minutes; advancing, or putting them back, as the days &s;horten or lengthen. If a man forgets to alter his watch, he lo&s;es or gains a quarter of an hour; and, of cour&s;e, cannot be very punctual to his engagements. There is no man &s;uf|ficiently learned in this place, to know the origin of this method of reckoning.</P>

<P>SICILY is in the &s;hape of a triangle, &s;ituated between 37 and 38 degrees, 40 min. North la|titude, and between the 12th and 16th degrees of Ea&s;t longitude; being about two hundred and ten miles long, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t; and one hundred and thirty-three broad, from North to South; three hundred round; and the large&s;t of all the Mediterranean i&s;lands. It was anciently called Sicania; but the Siculi con|quering great part of it, gave it the name of Sicilia. It has been held, that Sicily was originally joined to the continent of Italy, but gradually &s;eparated from it
<PB N="71" REF="71">
by the encroachment of the &s;ea, and the deva&s;tations of earthquakes. The &s;treights, between Sicily and Ca|labria, were, by the Latins, called <HI>Fretum Siculum;</HI> but its common name is, <HI>Il Faro de Me&s;&s;ina;</HI> from <HI>Pharus,</HI> the light-hou&s;e at the bottom of <HI>Cape di Faro.</HI> Op|po&s;ite this cape, in Calabria, &s;tands the rocky pro|montory of Scylla, at the di&s;tance of about five miles acro&s;s. The ebb and flood, in the&s;e &s;treights, are very irregular and &s;trong; where it is narrowe&s;t, between Faro and Sciglio, extremely impetuous. The flux of the &s;ea is much more violent in its de&s;cent towards Greece, than in its return upwards. During this de|&s;cent, there is no &s;temming the tide, even in a &s;trong &s;outherly wind; &s;o that it is u&s;ual to have the ve&s;&s;els hauled up along the coa&s;t of Calabria by men; and it is al&s;o impracticable for any ve&s;&s;els to cro&s;s the cur|rent, from Calabria to Sicily. Mr. <HI>Popowit&s;ch</HI> con|ceives, that this rapidity proceeds from the cour&s;e of the waters i&s;&s;uing out of the Atlantic ocean, into the Mediterranean, which directly bear upon this part of Calabria. It is, therefore, natural to think, that it is this direct impul&s;e of the &s;ea, on the coa&s;t of Calabria, which among the ancients, rai&s;ed &s;uch terrifying ideas of Cape Scylla, or Sciglio; for, till experience had &s;hewn how to avoid the danger, &s;hips were often driven again&s;t this promontory, and da&s;hed to pieces. This rock is near two hundred feet high, has a large ca&s;tle on its &s;ummit; and from it a line of hou&s;es ex|tends,
<PB N="72" REF="72">
on both &s;ides, in a &s;lope, to the beach, &s;emicir|cular, planted with trees, and &s;heltered with very high clifts; containing three or four hundred inhabitants; and gives the tide of prince, to a Calabre&s;e family. There are many &s;mall rocks that &s;hew their heads, at the ba&s;e of the large one; and are, probably, the dogs, that are de&s;cribed as howling round the mon&s;ter Scylla.</P>
<P>The whirlpool Charybdis, which was once &s;uppo&s;ed to be an aby&s;s, into which the waters precipitated them&s;elves, is a kind of vortex, ari&s;ing from the cur|rents of the &s;ea, at particular winds, oppo&s;ing each other. In a calm, and when the South wind does not blow, this place is &s;o &s;mooth, that a boat may cro&s;s it with &s;afety. It lies clo&s;e on the out&s;ide of the har|bour of Me&s;&s;ina. Ve&s;&s;els in this pa&s;&s;age, are obliged to go as near as po&s;&s;ible to the coa&s;t of Calabria, to avoid the &s;uction occa&s;ioned by the whirling of Charybdis; that when they come to the narrowe&s;t and mo&s;t rapid part of the &s;treights, they are in danger of being carried on the rock of Scylla. From whence the proverb, &s;till applied to tho&s;e, who, in at|tempting to avoid one evil, fall into another.</P>
<Q>Incidit in Scyllam, cupiens evitare Caribdem.</Q>
<P><PB N="73" REF="73">There is a fine fountain of white marble on the key of Me&s;&s;ina, repre&s;enting <HI>Neptune</HI> holding <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis</HI> chained, under the emblematical figures of two &s;ea mon&s;ters, as repre&s;ented by the poets.</P>
<P>Sicily is &s;o hot a country, that even in the begin|ning of January, the &s;hade is refre&s;hing; and it is only for a few months, in March, &amp;c. that any chilling winds are felt, and even then a little fire &s;uffices to bani&s;h the cold. The only appearance of winter, is toward the &s;ummit of Mount Aetna; where &s;now falls, and where it is pre&s;erved for u&s;e in the following manner. Pits are dug in the open air; and in the&s;e they lay the &s;now, with &s;traw or &s;tubble, and &s;alt. <HI>Stratum &s;uper &s;tratum,</HI> layer upon layer, and then cover the place with earth. In &s;ummer, when wanted, one of the&s;e pits are opened on one &s;ide, and the &s;now being taken out, the hole is again clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The hot &s;irroc winds are as powerful here as at Naples. Though the i&s;land appears to be one entire rock, the &s;oil is exceedingly fertile. Anciently it was &s;tiled the granary of Rome; and now it exports great quantities to Naples, which would otherwi&s;e be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. It is, however, far from being well culti|vated; &s;everal tracts on the we&s;tern &s;ide lying wa&s;te. Its wine is excellent, as are al&s;o all fruits, together with honey, oil, &s;alt, &s;affron, and &s;ugar; which la&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="74">
is produced in the neighbourhood of Mount Aetna. All the coa&s;ts afford good fi&s;heries, particularly for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unny; the cattle are fine, and all &s;orts of game in plenty. Great profits are made here of &s;ilk, where it was introduced in 1130, from the Holy Land, and hence &s;oon &s;pread to Naples, Spain, and the French provinces bordering on Italy. In this i&s;land are al&s;o found gems, or marble &s;tones; metals and minerals, as gold, &s;ilver, copper, tin, lead, iron, allum, and a variety of hot baths, and medicinal &s;prings.</P>
<P>Many of their &s;prings are boiling hot; others &s;till more &s;ingular, are colder than ice, and yet never freeze.</P>
<P>In &s;everal places, they have fountains, that throw up a kind of oil on their &s;urface, which the pea&s;ants burn in lamps, and u&s;e for many other purpo&s;es. There is &s;till one more remarkable at Nico&s;ia, called <HI>Il fonia Canaletto.</HI> This is covered with a thick &s;cum, like pitch, which the country people e&s;teem a &s;ove|reign remedy in rheumatic, and other complaints.</P>
<P>The water of a &s;mall lake, near Na&s;o, is celebrated for dying every thing, put into it, black; though the wa|ter is remarkably pure and tran&s;parent. They have a va|riety of &s;ulphureous baths, where the patient is thrown into a profu&s;e &s;weat, only from the heat of the vapour.
<PB N="75" REF="75">
About a mile and a half from Palermo, at a &s;mall beach where the people go to &s;wim; there are many &s;prings of warm water, that ri&s;e even with the &s;ea, at the depth of five or &s;ix feet.</P>
<P><HI>Brydone</HI> is of opinion, that not only Mount Aetna, but the greate&s;t part of Sicily, and almo&s;t the whole of the circumjacent i&s;lands, have been originally formed by &s;ubterraneous fire; from the di&s;tant hot &s;prings, and from throwing lava, pumice, and tuffa, at a great di&s;tance from Aetna.</P>
<P>At Trapany is a con&s;iderable coral-fi&s;hery; in &s;hort, whatever &s;eems requi&s;ite in point of nece&s;&s;ity, delight, or ornament, this country affords in &s;uch a liberal manner; that the inhabitants, notwith&s;tanding how much it is burdened by their viceroys, live at their ea&s;e and grow rich.</P>
<P>The great &s;tanding commodity, as I have ob&s;erved, is wheat. They pre&s;erve their grain, not by expo&s;ing it to the air, as we do, but by &s;hutting it up in pits, or where the &s;oil is dry, or in caverns in the rock. The&s;e open by a &s;mall hole at top, and widen below; here they pour down their wheat, after it has been made ex|ceedingly dry; and, ramming it hard, they cover up the hole, to protect it from rain; and a&s;&s;ure us, it will pre&s;erve in this manner for many years.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="76">The &s;oda is a plant much cultivated here, and turns out to good account. This is the vegetable, that by the action of the fire, is afterwards converted into mir|rors and chry&s;tals. Great quantities are &s;ent annually to Venice, to &s;upply the gla&s;s-hou&s;es. Their honey is delicious, even &s;uperior to that of Minorca. It is found by the pea&s;ants in the hollows of trees, and rocks. The &s;ugar-cane thrives well here, and they make &s;ugar enough for home-con&s;umption. Liquo|rice juice is preferred both here and in Calabria. The juice is &s;queezed out of the roots; after which it is boiled to a con&s;i&s;tency, and formed into cakes, which are packed up with bay-leaves, and exported in the &s;ame order as we receive them.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the Northern parts of the i&s;land, they find &s;hell-fi&s;h, that produces a kind of flax, of which gloves and &s;tockings are made. This is the mu&s;cle, found in great quantities at Tarentum.</P>
<P>The pi&s;tachio nut is much cultivated here, and with great &s;ucce&s;s. The&s;e trees, like many others, are male and female; the male is always barren; but, unle&s;s a quantity of the&s;e are mixed in every planta|tion, the pi&s;tachio-tree never bears a nut. But of all the variety cultivated in Sicily, the manna-tree is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t profitable. It is a kind of a&s;h, and re&s;embles it much. About the beginning of Augu&s;t,
<PB N="77" REF="77">
during the greate&s;t heat, an inci&s;ion is made in the bark near the root, and a thick, whiti&s;h liquor is im|mediately di&s;charged from the wound, which &s;oon hardens in the &s;un; when it is carefully taken off, and and gathered into boxes. They renew the&s;e inci&s;ions every day during the &s;ea&s;on; wounding the tree on one &s;ide only, re&s;erving the other &s;ide for the next year.</P>
<P>The cantharides fly is a Sicilian commodity, found on &s;everal trees of Aetna.</P>
<P>The marbles of Sicily would be a great &s;ource of opulence, if the quarries were encouraged; at Cen|torbi, they have a kind of &s;oft &s;tone, that di&s;&s;olves in water, and is u&s;ed to wa&s;h linen in&s;tead of &s;oap, from which property it is called <HI>Pietra Saponaro;</HI> &s;oapy &s;tone. They likewi&s;e find here, as well as in Calabria, the celebrated &s;tone, which, on being watered, and ex|po&s;ed to a pretty violent degree of heat, produces a plentiful crop of mu&s;hrooms: but, it would be end|le&s;s to give an account of all the various commodities, and curious productions of this i&s;land. It is al&s;o well watered; for it has five principal rivers.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of their Hi&s;tory.</HEAD>
<P>SICILY has had many ma&s;ters, and being cla&s;&s;ic ground, it may not be unentertaining to our readers, to have a &s;hort &s;ketch of its hi&s;tory. This i&s;land was invaded by the Greeks, &s;ix or &s;even centuries before the birth of Chri&s;t, and they became blended with the natives. Ari&s;tocracy prevailed fir&s;t; tyranny &s;ucceeded, under Phalaris o&s; Agrigentum, &s;ix hundred years before Chri&s;t; and democracy followed. Syracu&s;e went to pieces by di&s;&s;ention, and their arts and &s;ciences fell before it. Soon after the &s;ettlement of the Gre|cians; the Carthaginians, from Africa, invaded it with large bodies of forces; and, about five hundred before Chri&s;t, made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of all the We&s;tern parts. The old inhabitants, the Siculi, kept the midland county, and the Greeks the ea&s;tern coa&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Diony&s;ius,</HI> the elder, had the &s;upreme command at Syracu&s;e. Avarice, de&s;poti&s;m, and cruelty, marked
<PB N="79" REF="79">
his reign; and his &s;on, <HI>Diony&s;ius,</HI> the younger, &s;uc|ceeded him, who was the greater tyrant of the two&punc; <HI>Agathocles,</HI> a tyrant, however, &s;eized the throne, and deluged the country with blood. This man, at war with the Carthaginians, drove them off his coa&s;t, fol|lowed them to Africa, routed them in a pitched battle, burnt their fleet, and laid their territory wa&s;te. But the Sicilian forces were men of no principle; murder, and riot en&s;ued upon the victory. They murdered the friends and children of their king; he e&s;caped to Sicily, and there met a death which his crimes de|&s;erved.</P>
<P><HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> king of Epirus, now took the lead, re|duced all parties to obedience; but, making Sicily feel the weight of his hand, the Sicilians &s;oon drove him out. At this time, a crew of mi&s;creant Romans took Me&s;&s;ina, &s;laughtered the inhabitants; e&s;labli&s;hed a republic there, and became trouble&s;ome to <HI>Hiero</HI> II. whom the Greeks rai&s;ed to the chie&s; command at Sy|racu&s;e. He leagued with Carthage to turn out the Romans; but, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted from Italy, defeated the Carthaginians, and <HI>Hiero</HI> became an ally of the re|public. This began the fir&s;t punic war.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the &s;everal dates, &s;ee Tru&s;ler's Chronology.</NOTE> <HI>Hamilcar Barcas</HI> long &s;upported the African cau&s;e; but, not
<PB N="80" REF="80">
&s;uccceding to his wi&s;hes, led the Carthaginians to pur|cha&s;e peace of the prince of Sicily. This did for &s;ome time; but the vanqui&s;hed party gaining &s;trength, <HI>Hannibal, Hamilcar</HI>'s &s;on, per&s;uaded them to renew the combat; and for &s;ixteen years carried war into the heart of the Roman territories. This was the &s;econd punic war. <HI>Hiero,</HI> of Syracu&s;e, kept terms with both parties; but, being &s;ucceeded by his grand&s;on <HI>Hiero|nymus,</HI> who contracted an alliance with Carthage, he &s;oon fell a victim to his own folly. Syracu&s;e was now independent; but <HI>Marcellus</HI> &s;oon after be&s;ieged it, under the advice of <HI>Archimedes,</HI> and took it.</P>
<P>From this time, Sicily relinqui&s;hed all martial ideas, for many generations; the people turned their thoughts to peace and agriculture, till, in 827, the Sa|racens &s;ubdued the country, and cho&s;e Palermo for their capital, and the &s;tandard of <HI>Mahomet</HI> triumphed for about two hundred years.</P>
<P>In 1038, <HI>George Maniaces</HI> was &s;ent with great force, by the Greek empire, to attack Sicily. He did this, in conjunction with &s;ome Norman troops, whom he took into pay, and &s;ucceeded. <HI>Robert</HI> and <HI>Roger,</HI> Normans of Hauteville, afterwards conquered Sicily on their own account. After a ten years &s;truggle, the Saracens yielded it up in 1072, and <HI>Robert</HI> ceded it to his brother <HI>Roger,</HI> who a&s;&s;umed the title of Great
<PB REF="81">

<PB N="81" REF="82">
Earl of Sicily. He was &s;ucceeded by <HI>Simon,</HI> his elde&s;t &s;on, and <HI>Simon</HI> by <HI>Roger,</HI> in 1127, who called him&s;elf king. Hence the kingdom de&s;cended, from &s;on to &s;on, till the reign of <HI>William</HI> III. who was van|qui&s;hed by <HI>Henry</HI> of Swabia. Thus, it continued with the Germans, till after the battle of Benevento, when it &s;ubmitted to <HI>Charles</HI> of Anjou; and, for &s;e|veral years, obeyed him; notwith&s;tanding the wanton cruelty with which they were treated. But, a day of retribution came at la&s;t; Sicily had been revenged, for twelve years, by as many tyrants, as it contained Frenchmen; no redre&s;s could be obtained, nor hope left of future indulgence. Their be&s;t appeal, there|fore, was a dagger. <HI>John</HI> of Procida, with the con|nivance of the Greek emperor, and the king of Ar|ragon, &s;on-in-law to <HI>Manfred,</HI> who had been king of Sicily, encouraged the growing ferment; and, on Ea&s;ter-Monday, 1282, at the Ve&s;per-bell, the people of Palermo ro&s;e, and &s;lew every Frenchman they could find; man, woman, and child. Their example was followed by the whole i&s;land; not a French per&s;on was left living. No pardon could be expected from <HI>Charles.</HI> The in&s;urgents, therefore, offered the crown to <HI>Peter</HI> I. king of Arragon, who defended, and kept it. In his family it continued till 1469, when the line of Arragon becoming extinct, it fell to <HI>Ferdi|nand</HI> I. of Ca&s;tile. With this family it continued, till
<PB N="82" REF="83">
the death of <HI>John,</HI> king of Navarre; and, at the peace of Utrecht, it was ceded to <HI>Victor,</HI> duke of Savoy.</P>
<P>Not many years afterwards, the emperor <HI>Charles</HI> VI. forced him to relinqui&s;h Sicily, and take that of Sardinia in lieu of it: but, as the Spaniards had no concern in the&s;e bargains, they made a &s;udden attempt to recover Sicily; in this they failed, owing to the vi|gilance of the Engli&s;h admiral, <HI>Byng,</HI> who de&s;troyed their fleet in 1718.</P>
<P>In 1734, the Spaniards re&s;umed their de&s;ign with &s;ucce&s;s. The infant, <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> drove the Germans out, and was crowned king of the two Sicilies, at Pa|lermo: this kingdom being ceded to him, on con|dition it was never united to Spain. When he took the crown of Spain in 1759, he transferred that of Sicily to his &s;econd &s;on, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third of Sicily, and Fourth of Naples; his elde&s;t &s;on being an idiot, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the heirs male of <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and his younger brother; and, in de|fault of male i&s;&s;ue, to the females.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of Mount Aetna.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal mountain is Aetna; a volcano, that appears at &s;ea, when fir&s;t di&s;covered, as a prodigious chimney, or a very large rugged pillar. The perpendicular height, to the the top, is between two and three miles; &s;ome have imagined it more, and &s;ome rather le&s;s.</P>
<P>The whole mountain is divided into three di&s;tinct regions; the fertile, the woody, and the barren. The&s;e three are as different, both in climate and pro|ductions, as the three zones of the earth. The fertile region &s;urrounds the foot of the mountain, and is rich in the extreme, to the extent of about fourteen or fif|teen miles, where the woody region begins; being compo&s;ed almo&s;t entirely of lava; which, after a number of ages, is, at la&s;t, converted into the mo&s;t fertile of &s;oils. From Catania, to Nicole&s;i, twelve miles up the mountain; though its per|pendicular
<PB N="84" REF="85">
elevation is not, probably, more than three thou&s;and feet; the climate, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> who a&s;cended it in 1770, was totally changed. It was at the latter end of the month of May; and, at Catania, the harve&s;t was entirely over, and the heats in&s;up|portable. Here they were more moderate; and, in many places, the corn is as yet green. The road up was very bad, over old lavas, and mouths of extin|tingui&s;hed volcanoes, now converted into corn-fields, vineyards, and orchards. The fruit of this region is reckoned the fine&s;t in Sicily, particularly the figs.</P>
<P>The lavas, forming this region of the mountain, have thrown up an infinite number of beautiful little mountains; every where &s;cattered on the immen&s;e de|clivity of Aetna, all of a regular figure, and almo&s;t covered with beautiful trees, and the riche&s;t verdure. Each of the&s;e mountains has been transformed by one irruption, and, perhaps, in the cour&s;e of a few days; in the irruption of 1669, the &s;tones and a&s;hes, thrown out for months, formed a mountain of a great &s;ize, &s;even or eight miles round, and a thou&s;and feet in perpen|dicular height; other mountains are not above three or four miles round, and three or four hundred feet high.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="86">The progre&s;s of an irruption is as follows. The mountain, after &s;haking for vent, bur&s;ts open, &s;ome|where in its &s;ide. At fir&s;t, it only &s;ends forth thick &s;moke, and &s;howers of a&s;hes, that lays wa&s;te the ad|jacent country. The&s;e are &s;oon followed by red-hot &s;tones, and rocks of a great &s;ize, thrown to an im|men&s;e height in the air. The fall of the&s;e &s;tones, with the a&s;hes, form the mountains mentioned. After the new mountain is formed, the lava generally bur&s;ts out, from its lower &s;ide, and braving every thing before it, is generally terminated by the &s;ea. It &s;ometimes hap|pens, though rarely, that the lava bur&s;ts out at once, from the &s;ide of the mountain, without all the&s;e atten|dant circum&s;tances, as is the ca&s;e with Ve&s;uvius; where, the elevation being &s;o much &s;maller, the melted matter is generally carried up into the crater of the moun|tain, di&s;charging &s;howers of &s;tones and a&s;hes from the mouth; without forming any new mountain, only adding con&s;iderably to the old one. At la&s;t, the lava, ri&s;ing near the &s;ummit, bur&s;ts the &s;ides of the crater, and runs down in an ocean of liquid fire. Aetna, being on a much larger &s;cale, one crater is not enough to give its lava vent.</P>
<P><HI>Brydone</HI> was well a&s;&s;ured, by a per&s;on of credit, that he &s;aw, in an irruption of Aetna, large rocks of fire di&s;|charged to the height of &s;ome thou&s;and feet, with a noi&s;e more terrible than that of thunder. This per&s;on
<PB N="86" REF="87">
took notice, that from their greate&s;t height of the&s;e rocks of fire, till they reached the ground, it was twenty-one &s;econds of time; which, according to philo&s;ophic mea&s;urement, mu&s;t have been upwards of &s;even thou|&s;and feet.</P>
<P>We cannot pretend to follow Mr. <HI>Brydone,</HI> through all his de&s;cription of this mountain. Tho&s;e who wi&s;h for more information mu&s;t have recour&s;e to his tour through Sicily and Malta; but we will mention &s;ome of the mo&s;t curious particularities. The country of Hybla, celebrated for its honey, was overwhelmed by an irruption; it was called <HI>Mel Pa&s;&s;i;</HI> but, when overwhelmed, became barren, and was called <HI>Mal Pa&s;&s;i.</HI> In a &s;econd irruption, by a &s;hower of a&s;hes on it, it was again rendered fertile, and its name was then changed to <HI>Bel Pa&s;&s;i;</HI> but, in the great volcanic irruption of 1669, it was laid under an ocean of fire, and reduced to the utmo&s;t &s;tate of barrenne&s;s, and has &s;ince been called <HI>Mal Pa&s;&s;i.</HI> The lava, however, in its cour&s;e over this beautiful country, has left &s;everal little i&s;lands, or hillocks, uncovered; ju&s;t enough to &s;hew what it formerly was. The&s;e make a &s;ingular appearance, in all the bloom of luxuriant vegetation, &s;urrounded, and rendered almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, by large fields of black and rugged lava, that i&s;&s;ued from a mountain not more than three hundred feet high, fir&s;t formed it&s;elf by an irruption of Aetna.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="88"><HI>Ma&s;&s;a</HI> &s;ays, that in &s;ome irruptions of Aetna, the lava has poured down with &s;uch a &s;udden impetuo&s;ity; that, in the cour&s;e of a few hours, churches, palaces, and villages, have been melted down, and the whole run off in fu&s;ion, without leaving the lea&s;t mark of their former exi&s;tence: for, the&s;e churches and vil|lages having been built with lava, it is the property of &s;uch matter, to melt down in&s;tantly, on being over-run with other melted lava, and thus mingle in the general fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The great irruption of 1669, after &s;haking the whole country round for four months, and forming a very large mountain of &s;tones and a&s;hes, bur&s;t out about a mile above the mountain Montpeliere, then below it; and, de&s;cending like a torrent, bore directly again&s;t the middle of that mountain; and, as they pre|tend, perforated it from &s;ide to &s;ide: however, it is certain, it pierced it very deep. It then divided into two branches; and, &s;urrounding this mountain, joined again on its &s;outh &s;ide, laying wa&s;te the whole country, between that and Catania; &s;caled the walls of that city, and poured its flaming torrent into the ocean. In its way, it is &s;aid to have de&s;troyed the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of thirty thou&s;and people, and reduced them to beggary; it formed &s;everal hills, where vallies were before, and filled up a large lake. Among other
<PB N="88" REF="89">
&s;ingular circum&s;tances, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> the following is well a&s;certained.</P>
<P>A vineyard, belonging to a convent of je&s;uits, lay directly in its way. This vineyard was formed on an ancient lava, probably a thin one, with a number of caverns and crevices under it; the liquid lava enter|ing into the&s;e caverns, &s;oon filled them up; and, by de|grees, tore up the vineyard; and the je&s;uits, who every moment expected to &s;ee it buried, beheld, with ama&s;ement, the whole field begin to move off. It was carried, on the &s;urface of the lava, to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance: though the greate&s;t part was de&s;troyed, yet &s;ome of it remains to this day.</P>
<P>There is a great wildne&s;s, ferocity, and credulity, in the inhabitants of this mountain; they conceive the crater of Aetna, to be the mouth of hell. They, thinking, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> that we were come to look for hidden trea&s;ures, flocked round me, and watched every bit of &s;tone I took up; &s;eemed to entertain a bad opinion of the Engli&s;h, con&s;idering them as here|tics, de&s;erving of damnation; and gave me to under|&s;tand, that the Engli&s;h had a queen, <HI>Anne Boleyn,</HI> who was wife to a Chri&s;tian King; that &s;he made a heretic of him, and was, in con&s;equence, condemned to burn for ever in Mount Aetna. I a&s;ked them, if her hu&s;|band was there too, for he de&s;erved it much better
<PB N="89" REF="90">
than &s;he. <HI>Sicuro</HI> &s;aid, they are &s;afe enough, and all his heretic &s;ubjects; and, if you are of that number, you need not be in &s;uch a hurry to get there; you will be &s;ure of it at la&s;t.</P>
<P>On leaving Nicole&s;i, and in an hour and a half tra|velling over barren a&s;hes and lava, we arrived on the confines of the woody region, or temperate zone. As &s;oon as we entered the&s;e delightful fore&s;ts, we &s;eemed got into another world. The air, which was before &s;ultry and hot, was now cool and refre&s;hing, and every breeze was loaded with a thou&s;and perfumes; the whole ground being covered with the riche&s;t aromatic plants. Many parts of this region are, &s;urely, the mo&s;t heavenly &s;pots upon earth; and, if Aetna re&s;embles hell, it may, with equal ju&s;tice, be &s;aid to re&s;emble pa|radi&s;e without.</P>
<P>It is, indeed, a curious con&s;ideration, that this mountain &s;hould re-unite every beauty, and every hor|ror; but, our a&s;toni&s;hment encrea&s;es, in ca&s;ting our eyes on its higher regions. There we behold in perpetual union, the two elements that are at con|tinual war, an immen&s;e gulph of fire, for ever exi&s;ting in the mid&s;t of &s;nows, which it has not power to melt; and immen&s;e fields of &s;now and ice, for ever &s;urround|ing this gulph of fire, which they have not power to ex|tingui&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91">The woody region a&s;cends for about eight or nine miles, forming a girdle of the brighte&s;t green all round the mountain. <HI>Brydone,</HI> and his company, in the cour&s;e of one night, got about half through, and reached, before &s;un-&s;et, a large cave; where they lodged. It was &s;urrounded with &s;tately and maje&s;tic oaks; they kindled a fire, and made comfortable beds of the dried leaves. The thermometer, which was at 71, at Nicole&s;i, now fell below 60. The barometer &s;tood at 24. 2.</P>
<P>Not a great way from this cavern, are two of the mo&s;t beautiful mountains that &s;pring from Aetna. I mounted a mule, and rode to the top of one of them, a little before &s;un-&s;et. The pro&s;pect of Sicily, with the &s;urrounding &s;ea, and its i&s;lands, was wonderfully noble.</P>
<P>The next day we &s;crambled, on foot, &s;even miles, over the barren regions, or frigid zone, till we reach|ed, a little before break of day, the ruins of an an|cient &s;tructure, called the philo&s;opher's tower; &s;uppo|&s;ed to have been built by the philo&s;opher <HI>Empedocles,</HI> who took up his habitation here, the better to &s;tudy the nature of the mountain. The mercury here fell to 20. 6. we had now time, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> to pay our ado|rations, in &s;ilent contemplation of the &s;ublime objects of nature. The &s;ky was clear, and the immen&s;e vault
<PB N="91" REF="92">
of the heavens, appeared in awful maje&s;ty and &s;plen|dor. We found our&s;elves more &s;truck with venera|tion than below; the number of &s;tars &s;eeming to be in|finitely increa&s;ed, and the light of each appeared brighter than u&s;ual; the whitene&s;s of the milky way was like a pure flame, that &s;hot acro&s;s the heavens; and, with the naked eye, we could di&s;cern clu&s;ters of &s;tars, invi&s;ible in the regions below. We were amazed at the di&s;tinctne&s;s of vi&s;ion, not recollecting that we had now pa&s;&s;ed through ten or twelve thou&s;and feet of gro&s;s vapour, that blunts and confu&s;es every ray, before it reaches the &s;urface of the earth. We took notice of &s;everal of the&s;e meteors, called falling &s;tars; which &s;eemed as much above, as they do when &s;tand|ing on the earth below.</P>
<P>In about an hour's climbing, we reached a place where there was no &s;now; and where a warm, and comfortable vapour i&s;&s;ued from the mountain, which induced us to halt. The mercury here was at 19. 6 &frac12;. The thermometer three degrees below the freezing point; and, before we left the &s;ummit of Aetna, it fell two degrees more, to 27. From that &s;pot, it was only about three hundred yards to the highe&s;t &s;ummit; where we arrived in full time, to &s;ee the mo&s;t won|derful, and mo&s;t &s;ublime &s;ight in nature.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93">De&s;cription mu&s;t ever fall &s;hort; for no imagina|tion has dared to form an idea, of &s;o glorious, and &s;o magnificent a &s;cene; nor is there on the &s;urface of the globe, any one point, that unites &s;o many awful and &s;ublime objects.&mdash;The immen&s;e elevation, from the &s;urface of the earth; drawn, as it were, to a &s;ingle point, without any neighbouring mountain, for the &s;en&s;es and imagination to re&s;t on, and recover from their a&s;toni&s;hment, in their way down to the world: this point, or pinnacle, rai&s;ed on the point of a bottomle&s;s gulph, as old as the world; often di&s;|charging rivers of fire, and throwing out burning rocks, with a noi&s;e that &s;hakes the whole i&s;land. Add to this, the unbounded extent of the pro&s;pect, compre|hending the greate&s;t diver&s;ity, and mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenery in nature; with the ri&s;ing &s;un, advancing in the Ea&s;t, to illumine the wondrous &s;cene.</P>

creation, ri&s;ing to the &s;ight, catching life and beauty from every increa&s;ing beam. The &s;cene &s;till en|larges, and the horizon widens and expands around; till the &s;un, like the Creator, appears in the Ea&s;t; and, with his pla&s;tic ray, completes the mighty &s;cene.&mdash;All appears enchantment, and it is with difficulty we can believe that we are &s;till on earth. The &s;en&s;es, unac|cu&s;tomed to the &s;ublimity of &s;uch a &s;cene, are bewil|dered and confounded; and it is not till after &s;ome time, they are capable of &s;eparating and judging of the objects that compo&s;e it. The body of the &s;un is &s;een ri&s;ing from the ocean; immen&s;e tracks, both of &s;ea and land, intervening. The i&s;lands of Lipari, Panari, Alicudi, Strombolo and Volcano, with their &s;moaking &s;ummits, appear under your feet; and you look down on the whole of Sicily as on a map, and can trace every river, through all its windings, from its &s;ource to its mouth. The view is ab&s;olutely boundle&s;s on every &s;ide; nor is there one object within the circle of vi&s;ion to interrupt it, &s;o that the &s;ight is every where be&s;t in the immen&s;ity; and I am per&s;uaded, continues <HI>Brydone,</HI> it is only from the im|perfection of our organs, that the coa&s;ts of Africa are not di&s;covered; as they are certainly above the hori|zon. Could the eye &s;ee &s;o far, the di&s;tance of two thou&s;and miles would be di&s;coverable, from the top of Aetna. At Malta, which is near two hundred miles, they perceived the irruptions from the &s;econd region
<PB N="94" REF="95">
of Aetna; and that i&s;land is often di&s;covered when we are half-way up the mountain. <HI>Ma&s;&s;a,</HI> a Sicilian writer, &s;ays, that the African coa&s;t, as well as that of Naples, with many of its i&s;lands, have been &s;een from the top of Aetna.</P>
<P>The circumference of the great circle of Aetna, that is, of the woody part that &s;urrounds it, is not le&s;s than &s;eventy or eighty miles; and the circumference of the mountain at bottom, according to <HI>Recupero,</HI> is an hundred and eighty-three miles.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent crater, at the top of this immen&s;e vol|cano, is a circle of about three miles and a half. It goes &s;helving down on each &s;ide, and forms a regular hollow, like a va&s;t amphitheatre. From many places, of this &s;pace, i&s;&s;ue volumes of &s;ulphureous &s;moke; and, immediately on clearing the crater, rolls down the mountain &s;ide like a torrent; till reaching that part of the atmo&s;phere, of equal gravity with it&s;elf, it &s;hoots off horizontally, and forms a large track in the air, according to the direction of the wind. We did not attempt to go down into the crater; in the centre of which is the great mouth of the volcano. We looked down, and beheld it with awe and horror, and were not &s;urpri&s;ed, it had been con&s;idered as the place of the damned. When we reflect on the immen&s;ity of its depth, the va&s;t cells and caverns, whence &s;o
<PB N="95" REF="96">
many lava have i&s;&s;ued; the force of its internal fire, to carry up the&s;e lavas &s;o high into the air, with all the dreadful accompaniments; the boiling of the mat|ter, the &s;haking of the mountain, the explo&s;ions of the flaming rocks, &amp;c. we mu&s;t allow, that the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic imagination, in the mid&s;t of all its terrors, hardly ever formed an idea of a hell more dreadful.</P>
<P><HI>Empedocles</HI> was a native of Agrigentum, and is &s;up|po&s;ed to have died four hundred years before the Chri&s;tian aera. Perhaps his vanity, more than his phi|lo&s;ophy, led him to have erected the philo&s;opher's tower; nay, it is &s;aid to have carried him &s;till farther; that he might be con&s;idered as a god, and that the people might &s;uppo&s;e he was taken up to heaven, he is recorded to have thrown him&s;elf headlong into the great gulph of Mount Aetna, never &s;uppo&s;ing his death could be di&s;covered to mankind; but the treacherous mountain threw out his &s;lippers, which were of bra&s;s, and announced to the world the fate of this philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>We left the &s;ummit of the mountain at &s;ix in the morning, and it was eight at night before we reached Catania. On fir&s;t entering the fore&s;ts, the trees were &s;till as bare as in December; but, after we had de|&s;cended a few miles, we found our&s;elves in the mild|e&s;t, and &s;ofe&s;t of climates; the trees in full verdure,
<PB N="96" REF="97">
and the fields covered with all the flowers of &s;ummer; but, as &s;oon as we got out of the woods, and entered the torrid zone below them, we found the heat in&s;up|portable, and &s;uffered dreadfully before we reached the city.</P>
<P>The productions of the i&s;land are numberle&s;s, &s;ome of which I &s;hall mention by and by; but Aetna alone affords a greater variety, than many of the mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive kingdoms; and is, not le&s;s an epitome of the whole earth, in its &s;oil and climate, than in the va|riety of its productions. Be&s;ides the corn, the wine, the oil, the &s;ilk, the &s;pice, the delicious fruits of its lower region; the beautiful fore&s;ts, the flocks, the game, the tar, the cork, the honey, of its &s;econd; the &s;now and ice of its third; it affords, from its caverns, a variety of minerals, as cinnabar, mercury, &s;ulphur, allum, nitre, and vitriol; &s;o that this wonderful moun|tain produces every nece&s;&s;ary, and every luxury of life.</P>
<P>We are not then to be &s;urpri&s;ed at the ob&s;tinate at|tachment of the people to this mountain; and that all its terrors have not been able to drive them away from him; for, though he &s;ometimes cha&s;ti&s;es, he mixes &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings with his cha&s;ti&s;ements, that their affections can never be e&s;tranged; for, at the &s;ame
<PB N="97" REF="98">
time, that he threatens with a rod of iron, he pours down upon them all the ble&s;&s;ings of the ape of gold.</P>
<P><HI>Swinburne</HI> de&s;cribes the remarkable large che&s;nut-tree, in the fir&s;t region of Aetna, called, from its a&s;to|ni&s;hing &s;ize, <HI>Ca&s;tagno di cento cavalli,</HI> as &s;uppo&s;ing it ca|pable of &s;heltering a hundred hor&s;e under the canopy of its boughs. It &s;tands &s;ingle, on a gentle ri&s;ing; the ground round it, an open pa&s;ture. Its height has been dimini&s;hed, by cutting the tops of its branches, to encrea&s;e its bearing. It appears to be a group of trees; but is, in fact, an old trunk &s;plit down to the &s;urface of the earth, but united in one body at a very &s;mall depth below. Its circumference, one inch from the ground, is one hundred and ninety-&s;ix Engli&s;h feet. From this trunk ri&s;e five divi&s;ions; each of which &s;ends forth enormous branches. The outer &s;ur|face of the&s;e divi&s;ions, or &s;tems, are covered with bark; the inner &s;urface has no bark, and they all turn towards a common centre; a proof that all the&s;e &s;tems were once united. Between two of the &s;tems, two coaches may drive a-brea&s;t; and, in the centre of the five is built a hut, where the fruit of the tree is de|po&s;ited. It is a wonderful production of the veget|able kingdom.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP IV.</HI> Of the Cities, and their Inhabitants, particularly of Me&s;&s;ina.</HEAD>
<P>SICILY con&s;i&s;ts of three provinces, which are called Vallies, and has two principal cities, Pa|lermo and Me&s;&s;ina. Syracu&s;e was anciently the ca|pital, and a very flouri&s;hing republic; but is, at pre|&s;ent, extremely reduced by a &s;eries of calamities, e&s;|pecially by the earthquake in 1693. It is an arch|bi&s;hopric; has a harbour and &s;ome fortifications. It was taken by the Spaniards in 1735. Palermo is now the capital; though Me&s;&s;ina claims to be the ca|pital al&s;o.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;ina being the fir&s;t city we approach, in our way from Calabria, we will &s;peak of Me&s;&s;ina fir&s;t. This city is reckoned about twelve miles from Reggio, on the coa&s;t of Calabria. The harbour is one of the mo&s;t beautiful ever formed by nature; on the North|&s;ide runs, We&s;tward, a &s;emicircular tongue, or &s;lip of
<PB N="99" REF="100">
land; on which &s;tands the light-hou&s;e, and &s;ome &s;alt ponds; on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the harbour &s;tands the city, upon ri&s;ing ground, on a &s;emicircular &s;hore; forming together a circular harbour, and &s;omething like a hor&s;e-&s;hoe; open to the &s;ea at the We&s;t, but commanded by four forts; and, at the upper end of the harbour, in the centre, &s;tands the governor's hou&s;e, and a pentagon fortre&s;s, called the citadel; behind the city, ri&s;e immediately a number of lofty moun|tains, well &s;ecured, and Aetna as a pinnacle above the whole.</P>
<P>From the palace, now the governor's hou&s;e, at the foot of the&s;e mountains, ran one of the broade&s;t, cleane&s;t, and fine&s;t quays in Europe; ornamented with &s;tatues and fountains, more than a mile in length; with a beautiful range of regular lofty hou&s;es; with nine|teen gates, an&s;wering to as many &s;treets; it followed the &s;emicircular bend of the port, quite to the &s;ea, hiding the lower hou&s;es of the city, and &s;howing only the more beautiful, that &s;tand on the ri&s;e of the hill above it. I &s;ay <HI>ran,</HI> for this beautiful pile of buildings was thrown down in the earthquake of 1783, but is to be rebuilt. The anchorage is beyond the reach of a cannon-&s;hot from the &s;ea, and there is two hun|dred fathom water. The harbour, in &s;hort, is &s;o deep, clo&s;e to the quay, that ve&s;&s;els of the greate&s;t tonnage can unload upon it; and the harbour is large enough
<PB N="100" REF="101">
to contain all the &s;hips of Europe. Me&s;&s;ina has been declared a free port &s;ince 1728.</P>
<P>The inner part of Me&s;&s;ina is dirty, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> though it contains a great number of churches, and large &s;ub&s;tantial dwellings. <HI>De Non</HI> &s;ays, there are hand|&s;ome &s;treets, beautiful &s;quares, elegant marble foun|tains, eque&s;trian and pede&s;trian &s;tatues of bronze; large and hand&s;ome churches, va&s;t convents, and well-built hotels. He was there in 1778. <HI>Swinburne,</HI> about the &s;ame time. The population, &s;ays <HI>De Non,</HI> formerly corre&s;ponded with the appearance of the city; but the plague of 1743 or 1744, reduced it from one hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls, to thirty thou&s;and. Me&s;&s;ina could never recover this lo&s;s; and, of cour&s;e, the remote parts of the city are de&s;erted. The cathe|dral is Gothic, and enriched with Saracenic mo&s;aics on the altars and &s;hrines. In the trea&s;ury of the church is pre&s;erved, the <HI>Palladium</HI> of Me&s;&s;ina. This is a letter from the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> to its citizens, in latin the purport of which is, "An acknowledgment from her, that her &s;on is the &s;on of God; in his nature, both God and man; and that, after his re&s;urrection, he a&s;cended into heaven; and that <HI>Paul</HI> was an apo&s;tle, cho&s;en to preach the way of truth; dated in the year of Chri&s;t, forty-two." The &s;tory is as follows: After St. <HI>Paul</HI> had made &s;ome &s;tay at Me&s;&s;ina, the Me&s;|&s;ine&s;e prevailed on him to return to Jeru&s;alem,
<PB N="101" REF="102">
with an emba&s;&s;y of four per&s;ons, &s;ent by the city to the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI> Their excellencies, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> were graciou&s;ly received by her; and brought back a letter, written by her own hand, in the Hebrew tongue, which St. <HI>Paul</HI> tran&s;lated into Greek. By the irrup|tion of the Saracens, this invaluable trea&s;ure was lo&s;t, and utterly forgotten, till the year 1467; when <HI>Con|&s;tantine La&s;caris,</HI> a refugee Greek, found a copy of it; and, turning it into Latin, made it known to the ci|tizens, and then to all the Catholic world; and its authenticity is &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed at Me&s;&s;ina, that whoever confe&s;&s;es a doubt on the &s;ubject, is con&s;idered as an infidel.</P>
<P>In the dates to this curious letter, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> for there are more than one, there are &s;ome a&s;tronomi|cal blunders; and <HI>La&s;caris</HI> having annexed the date, <HI>Anno Chri&s;ti</HI> 42, was not aware, that <HI>Denis</HI> the Little, a Syrian monk, in the &s;ixth century, was the fir&s;t that made u&s;e of the aera, that commences at our Saviour's birth.</P>
<P>This favoured letter, is that on which the Me&s;|&s;ine&s;e built their preten&s;ions to pre-eminence, over the whole world; to its virtues and patronage they attribute every piece of good fortune, and to their own unworthine&s;s all &s;ini&s;ter events that have befallen them.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="103"><HI>Brydone</HI> &s;ays, the number of gallies and galliots, in this harbour, adds greatly to its beauty. They are com|mi&s;&s;ioned to cruize round the i&s;land, in order to protect it from the &s;udden inva&s;ions of the Barbarians, who are often very trouble&s;ome on the South coa&s;t. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els, when &s;ailing out of the harbour, make a very picture&s;que appearance; their oars rowing all together, and with the greate&s;t regularity. There are nine or ten men to each oar. Rowing &s;eems the harde&s;t work imaginable, for they all ri&s;e at every &s;troke of the oar; and when they pull, they almo&s;t throw them|&s;elves on their backs, and &s;eem to exert their utmo&s;t force. The&s;e galley-&s;laves are chained to their oars, and &s;leep every night on the bare benches, without any thing to throw over them.</P>
<P>On the 20th of May is celebrated a great fe&s;tival here, in honour of St. <HI>Francis.</HI> The Saint is carried in proce&s;&s;ion, with va&s;t ceremony, to the top of a hill, without the city; and receives there the homage of the people with becoming dignity. After this, he is lodged again in his chapel, and the people dance and make merry till &s;un-&s;et. The a&s;&s;embly-room was one fine green plain on the top of this hill, and a range of two thou&s;and &s;mall cannon were fired, &s;o quick after each other, by a train of running fire, that the ear could not &s;eparate the reports; their echo
<PB N="103" REF="104">
among the mountains, prolonged the &s;ound, and had a fine effect.</P>
<P>The view, from the top of this, is beautiful beyond de&s;cription. The &s;treights, between Sicily and Italy, appear like a va&s;t maje&s;tic river, flowing &s;lowly be|twixt two ridges of mountains; its banks adorned with rich corn-fields, vineyards, orchards, towns, vil|lages, and churches; and the pro&s;pect terminated on each &s;ide, by the tops of high mountains covered with wood.</P>
<P>The lark-&s;pur, <HI>Venus'</HI> look-gla&s;s, hawks-weed, and very fine lupins, grow wild over all the mountains round Me&s;&s;ina; al&s;o a variety of flowering &s;hrubs. All the fields are covered with the riche&s;t white clover, intermixed with a variety of aromatic plants, which perfume the air, and render their walks de|lightful. There are many fine &s;hady walks on all &s;ides of Me&s;&s;ina. The hou&s;es are large, and mo&s;t of the articles of life cheap, and in plenty, particu|larly fi&s;h; which is reckoned better here, than any where el&s;e in the Mediterranean. Hire of lodging is next to nothing. Almo&s;t half that noble range of buildings, on the quay, was ab&s;olutely uninhabited, even before the la&s;t earthquake; &s;o that the owners are glad to get tenants on any terms; of cour&s;e, all things con&s;idered, <HI>Brydone</HI> is of opinion, it is a place
<PB N="104" REF="105">
admirably calculated for valetudinarians, who &s;earch a warm climate. Even their winter-&s;ea&s;on is prefe|rable to that of Naples; and it has many advantages over Naples. They have, indeed, heavy rains &s;ome|times, for two or three weeks, but they never la&s;t longer; for even in the&s;e, there are &s;ome fair hours every day; and the &s;oil being a light gravel, the rain is no &s;ooner over, than the walks are dry.</P>

<P>The more we &s;ee of Palermo, &s;ays <HI>De Non,</HI> and the more minutely it is examined, the more we &s;hall be &s;en&s;ible of its beauty; hand&s;ome &s;treets, large and beautiful &s;quares, public fountains, and private ones, even on the fourth &s;tory of every hou&s;e; &s;uperb churches, and delightful walks; a good air, a va&s;t po|pulation, with a cleanline&s;s not to be found in any other city of the kingdom; a tolerable exten&s;ive com|merce, though not a twelfth part of what it might be; a great number of hou&s;es, at once rich, noble, and tri|umphant; a warm climate, lively pa&s;&s;ions, plea&s;ing women, and the luxury of the Sybaerites, are all found there.</P>
<P>Palermo, the capital of Sicily, wa&s;hed by the Tyrrhenian &s;ea, &s;ays <HI>Bi&s;ani,</HI> is &s;ituated at the foot of a chain of mountains, which forms a kind of amphi|theatre, and &s;upplies it with plenty of clear, pure, and
<PB N="106" REF="107">
healthy water. Though, apparently a &s;mall city, viewed from without, it is a large, fine, place; &s;ix miles in circumference. Two large &s;treets, more than a mile long, cro&s;s each other in right angles, and divide it into four parts, corre&s;ponding to four prin|cipal gates. The&s;e &s;treets are well paved, and have a broad pavement for foot pa&s;&s;engers; fine buildings, and well lighted at night. The central place, where the great &s;treets cro&s;s each other, forming a fine octagon, is called <HI>Piazza Villena;</HI> each &s;ide of which exhibits a re-union of the three orders of architecture, Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian; three &s;tatues and a fountain. there is not &s;uch a <HI>coup d'oeil,</HI> in any other city in Europe. The le&s;&s;er &s;treets run parallel to the&s;e great ones.</P>
<P>The places, the &s;tatues, the obeli&s;ks, the fountains, are not the mo&s;t remarkable objects here. Be&s;ides the fountain <HI>De Preteur,</HI> which, for the beauty of its marble, its de&s;ign, the great number of animals, mon|&s;ters, and &s;tatues, of which it is compo&s;ed; its circum|ference of five hundred and fifteen feet, and the di&s;|po&s;ition of its balu&s;trades, is allowed by connoi&s;&s;eurs, as a <HI>chef d'oeuvre</HI> of art; the churches are enriched with fine marbles, and alaba&s;ter, peculiar to this i&s;land; porphyry, precious &s;tones, and a profu&s;ion of gold and &s;ilver ve&s;&s;els. Some of them boa&s;t of excellent archi|tecture; and, in many, are pictures of the be&s;t Italian
<PB N="107" REF="108">
ma&s;ters. As the climate in&s;pires indolence and devo|tion, here are no le&s;s than eighty convents of monks and nuns; which are very humane and charitable. Here are about &s;even ho&s;pitals, and a general a&s;ylum for the poor.</P>
<P>One of the city gates opens to the marino, a delight|ful walk, which con&s;titutes one of the great plea&s;ures of the nobility of Palermo. It is bounded, on one &s;ide, by the city-wall; and, on the other, by the &s;ea; from whence there is always an agreeable breeze. In the centre of the marino, they have erected a kind of tem|ple, as an orche&s;tra for mu&s;ic; and, in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;ons, they are obliged to convert the night into day; the concert does not begin till midnight. At that time, the walk is crouded with carriages, and people on foot; and, the better to favour plea&s;ure and intrigue, there is an order, that no per&s;on &s;hall carry a light with him. The flambeaux are put out at the city-gate, where the &s;ervants wait for the return of the carriages; and the company generally continue an hour or two in utter darkne&s;s; except when the in|truding moon, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> with her horns and her cha&s;tity, comes to di&s;turb them. The concert ends about two in the morning; when, for the mo&s;t part, every hu&s;band goes home to his own wife. This is an admirable in&s;titution, and never produces any &s;can|dal. No hu&s;band is &s;uch a brute as to deny his wife
<PB N="108" REF="109">
the marino; and the ladies are &s;o cautious and cir|cum&s;pect, on their &s;ide, that, the more to avoid giving offence, they very often put on ma&s;ques.</P>
<P>In this hallowed walk, &s;ays <HI>De Non,</HI> the mo&s;t my&s;te|rious ob&s;curity, and mo&s;t rigorou&s;ly re&s;pected, reigns. The whole company is intermingled without di&s;tinc|tion. They &s;eek for and find each other; &s;upper parties are formed, and carried &s;nugly into execution; and upon the &s;pot, at taverns, built along the walls of the rampart.</P>
<P>Thus do the inhabitants of Palermo vary the order of nature, and pre&s;erve them&s;elves from feeling, and almo&s;t from recollecting the heat of their climate. They ri&s;e, &s;ays <HI>De Non,</HI> at noon, when the &s;ea-breeze, which &s;prings up at ten, has tempered the heat; they then repair either for bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure, to the Ca&s;|&s;aro, a large, and &s;uperb &s;treet, which cro&s;&s;es the whole city, from North to South. The prodigious popula|tion of Palermo, which is about 110,000 per&s;ons; is as great in proportion as that of Naples, and is here particularly di&s;covered. The number of carriages is truly a&s;toni&s;hing; for the&s;e are &s;o much in fa&s;hion at Palermo, that a coach is become a matter of ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity. There are no hackney-coaches; tho&s;e let out for hire, as well as tho&s;e of the nobility,
<PB N="109" REF="110">
are antique, inconvenient vehicles, drawn by mules. In &s;ummer, their carriages are more elegant.</P>
<P>The nobility parade in the Ca&s;&s;aro, till three in the afternoon; they then dine; thence they go to the Ma|rino, where a band of mu&s;ic awaits them two hours before night. From hence they pa&s;s to the <HI>Conver&s;aziones;</HI> or the opera, which is the only public entertainment, beginning an hour before night, and ending as do the <HI>Conver&s;aziones,</HI> at midnight, or one in the morning; when they return to the Marino, the con&s;tantly re|curring amu&s;ement of the Palermian day. This diur|nal round of plea&s;ure is interrupted, only by the Car|nival; which changes the order of enjoyments, only to render them more lively, by the two &s;ea&s;ons for the country, which are May and October; and by the fe&s;tival of Saint <HI>Ro&s;alia,</HI> which exhibits the mo&s;t &s;plendid, and mo&s;t agreeable enthu&s;ia&s;m of devotion, and which I &s;hall &s;peak of in its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>There are a variety of <HI>conver&s;aziones</HI> every night. There is one general one, &s;upported by the &s;ub&s;crip|tion of the nobility; open every evening at &s;un &s;et, and continuing till midnight, when the marino begins. At the&s;e meetings, the company merely conver&s;e; few play at cards, and the&s;e not long. At this a&s;&s;embly there are a number of apartments, lighted with wax-lights, and kept exceeding cool and agreeable. The
<PB N="110" REF="111">
private <HI>conver&s;aziones</HI> are always held, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> in the apartments of lying-in ladies; from this happy climate, childbearing is dive&s;ted of all its terror, and is only con&s;idered as a party of plea&s;ure. <HI>Brydone</HI> went to one of the&s;e, that of prince&s;s <HI>Palerno,</HI> the evening &s;he was brought to bed. The prince&s;s &s;at up in her bed, in an elegant undre&s;s, with a number of her friends about her; &s;he talked as u&s;ual, and &s;eemed perfectly well. The conver&s;ation is repeated every night, during her convale&s;cence, which gene|rally la&s;ts-eleven or twelve days. This cu&s;tom is uni|ver&s;al; and, as the ladies here are very prolific, three or four of the&s;e meetings occur every night; po&s;&s;ibly the Marino may not a little contribute towards them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Brydone</HI> &s;poke &s;o free of the ladies of fa&s;hion at Palermo, and his tour to Sicily, being tran&s;lated into French, and &s;preading to Palermo, the nobility have determined never to pay any attention to letters of recommendation, in favour of the Engli&s;h, nor re|ceive them on their travels. In con&s;equence of this, <HI>Swinburne,</HI> who followed <HI>Brydone,</HI> &s;ays, he could not obtain acce&s;s into any family.</P>
<P>The Sicilian ladies, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> marry at thirteen, or fourteen; and are, &s;ometimes, grandmothers before thirty. I was pre&s;ented, by count <HI>Stetela,</HI> to the prin|ce&s;s
<PB N="111" REF="112">
<HI>Partana,</HI> who had twelze children, the elde&s;t of whom was a fine girl of fifteen. I talked to the prin|ce&s;s, continues he, for half an hour, and concluded I was &s;peaking to her daughter; and, when the young lady entered, it was not ea&s;y to &s;ay which was young|e&s;t, or which was hand&s;ome&s;t. The prince&s;s a&s;&s;ured me, &s;he never enjoyed more perfect health than when in childbed; that, during her pregnancy, &s;he was often indi&s;po&s;ed; but that, immediately on delivery, &s;he was cured of all complaints, and was capable of enjoying the company of her friends, even more than at any other time. When I told her that the Engli&s;h ladies often died in childbed, and that the mo&s;t ea&s;y de|liveries were attended with violent pain and angui&s;h; &s;he lamented their fate, and thanked heaven &s;he was born a Sicilian.</P>
<P>Their ea&s;e, in childbirth, is owing to the climate, which relaxes the frame. Among the cold Alps, half their women die in labour; and tho&s;e who can afford it, often go dawn to the low countries, &s;ome weeks before they lie-in, and find their deliveries much ea&s;ier.</P>
<P><HI>Swinburne</HI> went out to &s;ea, purpo&s;ely to view Pa|lermo from it; and &s;ays, its exten&s;ive bay is confined by a circle of mountains, of various elevations and forms; and the &s;teeples, cupolas, and towers of the
<PB N="112" REF="113">
city, ri&s;e on the plain that extends from their foot, and line the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Palermo is walled round, almo&s;t in a circular form, and the principal &s;treets are &s;o decorated with &s;tatues, fountains, and buildings, as to pre&s;ent the idea of a royal city. Mo&s;t of the other &s;treets are narrow and crooked; and, being wretchedly paved, are buried in dirt during the winter. The city is well lighted, with reverberating lamps; and, in wet weather, moveable wooden bridges are provided for cro&s;&s;ing the kennels, which then become rapid torrents.</P>
<P>The cathedral was built in 1185, and is in a very ruinous condition. It is a Gothic edifice, but heavy, and void of all the cha&s;te proportions of the Grecian art. It contains &s;everal tombs of &s;overeigns; and, at the foot of the altar, re&s;ts the heroic earl <HI>Roger,</HI> con|queror of Sicily, and terror of infidels.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the churches are rich, in &s;ilver, gems, and marble; but their architecture, and embelli&s;h|ments, horrid. In &s;everal, the walls within are lined with red, or yellow marble; upon which, from the cieling to the floor, are glued ba&s;&s;o relievo figures of angels, bu&s;ts, and flowers in white marble.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="114">The palace, which &s;tands near the &s;mall gate, is an immen&s;e ma&s;s of di&s;cordant parts, built at different periods. The halls are of noble &s;ize, the courts of ju&s;tice are held on a ground floor, and batteries of cannon defend the approach.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;emblies, at the viceroy's palaces, &s;ays <HI>Swin|burne,</HI> gave me an opportunity of &s;eeing the whole corps of nobility collected together. The men are rather a comely race; but the ladies are little favoured by nature. Two girls, under eight years of age, heire&s;&s;es of great families, and already betrothed, made their appearance in the ball-room, decked out in the very exce&s;s of the mode; their &s;howy dre&s;&s;es, their diminutive &s;ize, and affected gravity, in dancing a minuet; joined to the fatherly care, their future hu&s;|bands anxiou&s;ly took of them, reminded me of dolls made to move round a table by clock-work.</P>
<P>In the &s;treets women hide their heads, in black veils; a very ancient mode of dre&s;s in this i&s;land, and very lately introduced at Naples, and there become fa&s;hionable.</P>
<P>The viceroy, like the viceroy of Ireland, affects in every thing the pageantry of royalty. His train of coaches are as &s;plendid; a &s;trong, well-dre&s;&s;ed body of guards attends his per&s;on; and, on parade days, his
<PB N="114" REF="115">
coachmen, po&s;tillions, and livery-&s;ervants, are dre&s;&s;ed in flowing wigs, without hats. When he goes to church, he receives the tribute of a cloud of incen&s;e; and he, alone, with great &s;olemnity, puts on his hat. On the 21&s;t of December, he makes an annual vi&s;it to the jails, where he pardons as many pri&s;oners as he plea&s;es. All law is that day dormant; and, although the magi&s;trates have a right to remon&s;trate, he is under no obligation to follow their advice; but, the viceroys are very cautious not to abu&s;e this privilege. If they pardon, it is on a report from the judges.</P>
<P>The Sicilians, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> appear frank and &s;in|cere; and their politene&s;s does not con&s;i&s;t in &s;hew and grimace, like &s;ome of the polite nations of the continent. The viceroy &s;ets the pattern of ho&s;|pitality, and he is followed by the re&s;t of the nobles. Notwith&s;tanding his great authority, he is affable and familiar, and makes his hou&s;e agreeable to every body. His table is &s;erved with elegance and magnificence, much &s;uperior to that of his Sicilian maje&s;ty; who eats off a &s;ervice of plate, at lea&s;t, three hundred years old, very black and ru&s;ty, as if it had been dug out of Her|culaneum.</P>
<P>Sicilian cookery is a mixture of French and Spa|ni&s;h; the olio &s;till pre&s;erves its rank and dignity, in the centre of the table, &s;urrounded by a numerous
<PB N="115" REF="116">
train of frica&s;ees, fricandeaus, ragouts, and pet de loups, like a grave Spani&s;h don, amid a number of little &s;mart marqui&s;&s;es. All the nobility, are magnifi|cent in their entertainments; particularly in their de|&s;erts and ices; of which there is a greater variety than in mo&s;t countries. They are very temperate in their wines; but, having learnt from the Engli&s;h the method of hob-a-nobbing, and toa&s;ting ladies, they are more free in drinking than they u&s;ed to be; and &s;ay, the Engli&s;h have made them drunkards. In their ordinary living, they are very frugal and temperate.</P>
<P><HI>Brydone</HI> dined with the bi&s;hop of Agrigentum, the riche&s;t bi&s;hop in the kingdom; thirty were at table, and there were not le&s;s than a hundred di&s;hes, dre&s;&s;ed with the riche&s;t and mo&s;t delicate &s;auces. By a modern refinement in luxury, they contrive to make the livers of their fowls, grow to a large &s;ize, and acquire a rich and high flavour; it is a cruel mode, which occa&s;ions lingering death to the poor animal; and it is, there|fore, be&s;t not to mention it. In their de&s;erts, be&s;ides a variety of fruit, they introduce a profu&s;ion of ices, in the &s;hape of peaches, figs, oranges, nuts, &amp;c. The company were chiefly prie&s;ts, but were very fond of punch, which they per&s;uaded Mr. <HI>Brydone</HI> and his friend to make; called it <HI>Pontio;</HI> and &s;poke loudly in its prai&s;e; declaring Pontio, alluding to <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> was a much better fellow than they had ever taken
<PB N="116" REF="117">
him for. One of the canons growing &s;ick, with drinking too much of it, and vomiting, exclaimed, &s;haking his head and groaning, <HI>Ah &s;ignior Capitano, &s;apeva &s;empre che Pontio era un grande traditore.</HI> "I always knew that <HI>Pontius</HI> was a great traitor." Their conver&s;ation ran on the plea&s;ures of the world; they &s;aid they were a happy fraternity; had long exploded every thing that is di&s;mal and melancholy; and were convinced, a chearful life on earth was the be&s;t prepa|ration for happine&s;s hereafter; that ab&s;tinence, from lawful plea&s;ures, was a &s;in.</P>
<Q><L>For God is paid when man receives:</L>
<L>T'enjoy is to obey.</L></Q>
<P>The Sicilians, continues <HI>Brydone,</HI> have always had the character of being very amorous, and &s;urely not without rea&s;on. The whole nation are poets; even the pea&s;ants; and a man &s;tands a poor chance of a mi&s;tre&s;s, that cannot celebrate her mu&s;es. Gallantry, here, is much on the &s;ame footing as in Italy. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of cici&s;beos is al&s;o pretty general, though not quite &s;o univer&s;al as on the continent. A breach, however, of the married vow, is not looked upon as a deadly &s;in. Hu&s;bands are content; and, like able generals, make up for the lo&s;s of one fortre&s;s, by taking another. Female licentiou&s;ne&s;s, however, has, by no means, come to &s;uch a height as in Italy.
<PB N="117" REF="118">
We &s;aw a great deal of dome&s;tic happine&s;s. Hu&s;bands and wives that truly love one another: &s;ights that are very rare on the continent. Indeed the &s;tyle that young ladies are brought up in here, &s;eems to lay a more &s;olid foundation for matrimonial happine&s;s, than either in France or Italy. The young ladies are not &s;hut up in convents till the day of their marriage; but live with their parents, and vi&s;it with them, being al|lowed as much liberty as with us. In their great a&s;|&s;emblies, we often &s;ee a number of young people, of both &s;exes, get together in a corner, and amu&s;e them|&s;elves for hours, at cro&s;s-purpo&s;es, or &s;uch like games, without the mother being at all unea&s;y. In general, they are quick and lively, and have a number of tho&s;e <HI>jeux d'e&s;prit,</HI> which is a proof, in all countries, of a familiar intercour&s;e of the &s;exes; for all the&s;e games are in&s;ipid, if they are not &s;ea&s;oned by &s;ome|thing of that invi&s;ible and &s;ubtil agency, which ren|ders every thing more intere&s;ting, in the&s;e mixed &s;o|cieties, than in the lifele&s;s one, compo&s;ed of only one &s;ex.</P>
<P>In the gardens, about Palermo, there are a profu|&s;ion of fine flowers. <HI>Swinburne</HI> was here in Decem|ber, and &s;ays, the borders were full of ro&s;es, and other flowers in bloom, and very highly &s;cented; and violets and carnations had been in flower &s;ince Octo|ber. Many fruit-trees, here, bear two crops; they
<PB N="118" REF="119">
produce a fruit at the u&s;ual &s;ea&s;on; then bud again, and bear fruit, a &s;econd time, near the middle of Sep|tember; though the &s;econd fruit is not &s;o large and fine flavoured as the fir&s;t. The manna-tree yields, annually, about a pound of manna, worth four hun|dred tari and a half; the tari equal to the carline of Naples. The&s;e trees never arrive at a great &s;ize, owing to their annual bleedings; but will yield manna for a hundred years. The &s;ugar-cane, on the Ea&s;t|ern coa&s;t of Valdinote, grows to a fine &s;ize, and is very juicy; thrives almo&s;t without care; has heat and mixture enough; and neither hurricanes nor in&s;ects to de&s;troy them, but, hands are &s;carce, and labour dear; and, of cour&s;e, not much is done in it.</P>
<P>There are two &s;mall countries, one to the Ea&s;t, the other to the We&s;t of Palermo, where the prin|cipal nobility have their county palaces. I &s;hall only &s;peak of one; which, for all its &s;ingularity, is certainly not to be parallelled on the face of the earth; it be|longs to the prince of <HI>Patagonia;</HI> a man of immen&s;e fortune; who has devoted his whole life, to the &s;tudy of mon&s;ters and chimaeras; greater, and more ridi|culous than ever entered into the imagination of the wilde&s;t writers of romance, or knight-errantry.</P>
<P>The amazing croud of &s;tatues, that &s;urround his hou&s;e, appear at a di&s;tance, like a little army, drawn
<PB N="119" REF="120">
up for its defence; but, when you get among them, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> you imagine you have got into the re|gions of delu&s;ion and enchantment; for of all that immen&s;e group, there is not one made to repre&s;ent any object in nature; nor is the ab&s;urdity of the wretched imagination that created them le&s;s a&s;toni&s;h|ing, than its wonderful fertility. He has put the heads of men, to the bodies of every &s;ort of animal; and the heads of every other animal, to the bodies of men; &s;ometimes he makes a compound of five or &s;ix animals, that have no re&s;emblance in nature. He puts the head of a lion to the neck of a goo&s;e, the body of a lizard, the legs of a goat, and the tail of a fox; on the back of this mon&s;ter he puts another, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more hideous, with five or &s;ix heads, and a bu&s;h of horns, that beat the bea&s;t in the revela|tions, all to nothing. There is not a horn in the world that he has not collected; and his plea&s;ure is to &s;ee them flouri&s;hing on the &s;ame head. This is a &s;trange piece of madne&s;s, and is truly unaccountable, that he has not been &s;hut up many years ago; but, he is perfectly innocent, and troubles no one by the in|dulgence of his phrenzy. I have conver&s;ed with him, continues <HI>Brydone,</HI> and heard him talk &s;peciou&s;ly enough, on all occa&s;ions; and he gives bread to a number of &s;tatuaries and workmen, whom he rewards, in proportion as they can bring their imaginations to coincide with his own.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="121">To this extraordinary place, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> the traveller is admitted through a large gate; on the plinth of which are fixed, &s;ix colo&s;&s;al white-wa&s;hed &s;tatues of hu&s;&s;ars, or halberdiers, to di&s;pute the en|trance of an avenue, three hundred yards long; not of cypre&s;&s;es, elms, or orange-trees; but of mon&s;ters, to the number of &s;ix hundred. On each &s;ide of this avenue is a parapet-wall, loaded with more horrible figures than were ever rai&s;ed by <HI>Armida,</HI> and all the enchantment of <HI>Ario&s;to.</HI> Bu&s;ts of punchinellos and harlequins, with &s;nakes twi&s;ted round them. Heads of dwarfs, with huge perriwigs; of a&s;&s;es and hor&s;es, with laced cravats, and ruffs, compo&s;e the lower range of this gallery; and, at intervals of an hundred yards, are clu&s;tered pillars, &s;upporting curious groups of figures; &s;ome are mu&s;icians, others pigmies, opera-heroes, old women grinning; lions, and other bea&s;ts, &s;eated at tables, with napkins under their chins, eating oy&s;ters; prince&s;&s;es with feathers and fur-belows, o&s;triches in hoops, and cats in boots.</P>
<P>The old ornaments, in the court that &s;urrounds the palace, that were put up by his father, who was a man of ta&s;te and &s;en&s;e, have been all knocked to pieces, to make room for this new creation. The&s;e mon|&s;ters, and animals, line the battlements of the man&s;ion; and &s;tand &s;o thick, and in &s;uch menacing attitudes, as it would not be &s;afe to approach in a windy day.

They are all carved out of very &s;oft &s;tone, that crum|bles away, and will not la&s;t long. The walls are ca&s;ed with ba&s;&s;o-relievos, ma&s;ks, medallions, &s;criptural &s;ub|jects, heathen gods, emperors, and po&s;ture-ma&s;ters; &s;ome in a good &s;tyle, copied from the antique; but, the greate&s;t part con&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch figures, as we meet with in Dutch fairs, repre&s;enting the &s;ea&s;ons and elements.</P>
<P>The in&s;ide of this enchanted ca&s;tle, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> corre&s;ponds exactly with the out; it is, in every re|&s;pect, as whim&s;ical and fanta&s;tical; and, you cannot turn your&s;elf to any &s;ide, where you are not &s;tared in the face by &s;ome hideous figure, or other. Some of the apartments are &s;pacious and magnificent, with high arched roofs; which, in&s;tead of plai&s;ter or &s;tucco, are compo&s;ed entirely of large mirrors, nicely joined together. The effect that the&s;e produce, (as each of them make a &s;mall angle with the other) is exactly a multiplying-gla&s;s; &s;o that, when three or four peo|ple are walking below, there is always the appearance of three or four hundred walking above. The whole of the doors are, likewi&s;e, covered over with &s;mall pieces of looking-gla&s;s; cut into the mo&s;t ridiculous &s;hapes, and intermixed with a great variety of chry&s;|tal and gla&s;s of different colours. All the chimney-pieces, windows, and &s;ide-boards, are crowded with pyramids and pillars of tea-pots, candle cups, bowls, cups, &s;aucers, &amp;c. &s;trongly cemented together. Some
<PB N="123" REF="123">
of the&s;e columns are not without their beauty. One of them has a large china chamberpot for its ba&s;e, and a circle of pretty little flower-pots for its capital; the &s;haft of the column, upwards of four feet long, is compo&s;ed entirely of tea-pots, of different &s;izes, di|mini&s;hing gradually from the ba&s;e to the capital. The profu&s;ion of choice, that has been employed in form|ing the&s;e columns, is incredible. There are not le&s;s than forty of them.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the rooms are paved with fine marble tiles of different colours, that look like &s;o many tomb-&s;tones; &s;ome of the&s;e very richly wrought, with lapis lazuli, porphyry, and other valuable &s;tones. The windows are compo&s;ed of a variety of gla&s;s, of every colour, mixed without order or regularity. The hou&s;e-clock is ca&s;ed in the body a &s;tatue; the eyes of the figure moves with the pendulum, turning up their white and black, alternately, and make a hi|deous appearance.</P>
<P>His bed-chamber and dre&s;&s;ing-room are like two apartments of <HI>Noah</HI>'s ark; there is &s;carce a bea&s;t, however vile, that he has not placed there; birds, pigs, &s;erpents, lizards, &s;corpions, all cut in marble, in their re&s;pective colours. There are a good many bu&s;ts too, not le&s;s &s;ingularly imagined. Some of the&s;e make a very hand&s;ome profile on one &s;ide; turn to
<PB N="123" REF="124">
the other and you have a &s;keleton; here you &s;ee a nur&s;e with a child in her arms, its back is exactly that of an infant; its face, that of a wrinkled old woman of ninety.</P>
<P>For &s;ome minutes we can laugh at the&s;e follies, &s;ays <HI>Brydone;</HI> but indignation and contempt, &s;oon get the better of your mirth, and the laugh is turned into a &s;neer.</P>
<P>The family-&s;tatues are charming; they have been done from &s;ome old pictures, and make a mo&s;t vene|rable appearance; but, this man has dre&s;&s;ed them out, from head to foot, in new and elegant &s;uits of marble; and the effect it produces, is more ridiculous than any thing that can be conceived. Their &s;hoes are made of black marble; their &s;tockings are chiefly of red; their clothes of different colours, blue, green, and va|riegated, with a rich lace of <HI>Giall'antique.</HI> The wigs of men, and head-dre&s;&s;es of the ladies, are of white marble; &s;o are their &s;hirts, with long flowing ruffles of alaba&s;ter.</P>
<P>The&s;e fooleries, &s;ays <HI>De Non,</HI> mu&s;t create in us a contempt for the owner; who is, otherwi&s;e, a very amiable man. Fortunately, the confu&s;ion of the ob|jects effaces them from the mind, as &s;oon as they are &s;een, and leaves only an indi&s;tinct idea of this col|lection;
<PB N="124" REF="125">
apparently formed without motive, and as difficult to de&s;cribe, as di&s;agreeable to behold.</P>
<P>The prince of P. author of this collection, is a poor, mi&s;erable, lean figure; &s;hivering at a breeze, and &s;eems to be afraid of every body he &s;peaks to. He is one of the riche&s;t &s;ubjects in the i&s;land; and, it is thought, has not laid out le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and pounds, (<HI>Swinburne</HI> &s;ays, forty thou&s;and pounds, in the creation of this world of mon&s;ters and chimaeras; how|ever, as we have ob&s;erved, it gives bread to a num|ber of poor people, to whom he is an excellent ma&s;ter. His hou&s;e, at Palermo, is a good deal in the &s;ame &s;tile; his carriages are covered with plates of bra&s;s, and &s;ome of them mu&s;ket-proof.</P>
<P>Government have had &s;erious thoughts of demo|li&s;hing the regiment of mon&s;ters he has placed round his hou&s;e; but, as he is humane and inoffen&s;ive, and as this would certainly break his heart, they have yet forborne. Seeing of them, it is &s;aid, by women with child, has been already attended with very unfortu|nate circum&s;tances. Several living mon&s;ters have been brought forth in the neighbourhood. The ladies, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> complain, that they dare not take an airing that way; that &s;ome hideous form always haunts their imagination for &s;ome time after;
<PB N="125" REF="126">
their hu&s;bands too, are as little &s;atisfied with the great variety of horns.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this extravagance of the prince, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> his family has often wanted clothes and victuals. Having run him&s;elf out, his relations have taken upon them the admini&s;tration of his e&s;tate, and he has left the place. Since he has been debarred the plea&s;ure of rai&s;ing devils, he has attached him&s;elf to &s;aints, and &s;pends his time in following proce&s;&s;ions, and vi&s;iting churches. On being a&s;ked what part of the globe the originals of the figures upon his walls, are to be met with; he replied, in Egypt; where <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> &s;ays, the rays of the &s;un act &s;o power|fully, on the fat &s;lime left by the Nile, that it engen|ders all &s;orts of uncouth, and otherwi&s;e, unknown animals.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the Fe&s;tival of Ro&s;olia, at Palermo.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t magnificent, and brilliant &s;pec|tacles in the world, is the fe&s;tival held annually at Palermo, on the twelfth of July, and the four fol|lowing days, in memory and honour of Saint <HI>Ro&s;olia,</HI> the patrone&s;s of the city.</P>
<P><HI>Ro&s;olia,</HI> or <HI>Ro&s;olia,</HI> for &s;he is thus differently called, as report goes, was the daughter of a count <HI>Sinibaldus;</HI> and, in the twelfth century, to &s;ave her virginity from the brutality of the Saracens, &s;he retired to a cave in Mount Qui&s;quina, and afterwards came to live in Mount Pellegrino, a mountain quite de|tached from others, about a mile from the gates of Palermo. It is a tall rock, without a tree or a &s;hrub, except near the top. Here was her grotto, and here &s;he died, and remained unknown till in the year 1624. During the time of a dreadful plague, a holy man had a vi&s;ion, that the &s;aint's bones were lying in a cave
<PB N="127" REF="128">
near the top of this mountain; that, if they were taken up with due reverence, and carried in proce&s;|&s;ion, thrice round the walls of the city, the plague would cea&s;e; he was li&s;tened to by the vulgar, they ro&s;e and &s;upported his cau&s;e; and, the magi&s;trates to appea&s;e them, &s;ent to Monte Pellegrino; when Io! the mighty di&s;covery was made; the &s;acred bones were found. The city was freed from the plague. <HI>Ro&s;alia</HI> became the greate&s;t &s;aint in the calendar; churches were reared, altars were dedicated, and mona&s;teries appointed to this new divinity; who&s;e dig|nity and con&s;equence, have ever &s;ince been &s;upported at an incredible expence.</P>
<P>There is a zig-zag road up the &s;ide of this moun|tain, in length, about an hour's walk, made at the ex|pence of the &s;tate; the &s;enate levying a tax upon meat for the purpo&s;e. A convent and portico clo&s;e up the entrance of a &s;pacious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avern. A rich altar covers the marble effigy of the &s;aint, repre&s;ented lying at full length. It is covered with a &s;ilver ve&s;t, the gift of the King of Spain.</P>
<P>People of education are very grave here, and de&s;pi&s;e the wild &s;uper&s;tition of the vulgar; yet, they go to ma&s;s regularly, and attend the ordinances with great re&s;pect and decency, and are plea&s;ed with us for conforming to their cu&s;toms, and for not appearing
<PB N="128" REF="129">
openly to de&s;pi&s;e their rites and ceremonies. This attention of theirs, not to offend weak minds, &s;hews a good heart and under&s;tanding. They boa&s;t not of their infidelity; neither do they pe&s;ter you with it, as in France; and where, although they pretend to be lawle&s;s; they do, in fact, believe more than any na|tion on the continent.</P>
<P>A man can have no good principles, who makes a parade of his contempt for things held &s;acred; it is an open in&s;ult to the judgment of the public. An Eng|li&s;hman, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> a few years ago, offended egre|giou&s;ly in this re&s;pect, and the people of Palermo &s;till &s;peak of him with contempt and dete&s;tation. It happened one day, in the great church, during the ele|vation of the ho&s;t, when every one el&s;e were on their knees, that this man was &s;tanding, without any appear|ance of re&s;pect to the ceremony; a young nobleman near him expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e at it: "It is &s;trange, Sir, (&s;aid he) that you who have had the education of a gentleman, and ought to have the &s;entiments of one, &s;hould chu&s;e thus to give &s;o very public offence." "Why, 'tis, (&s;aid the Engli&s;hman) I don't believe in tran&s;ub&s;tantiation."&mdash;"Neither do I, Sir, (replied the other) and yet you &s;ee I kneel."</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="130">Mr. <HI>Brydone</HI> was pre&s;ent at the fe&s;tival of St. <HI>Ro&s;alio,</HI> and gives us the following full and entertaining ac|count of it.</P>
<P>The cor&s;o is one of the great &s;treets that cro&s;&s;es the city; it is a mile long, and extends to the maund, or public walk, which continues its length another mile, along the &s;ea-&s;ide. The &s;urface of the &s;treet is concave; and, of cour&s;e, we can &s;ee ea&s;ily from end to end. Some time before the fe&s;tival, great prepara|tions are made for illuminating this &s;treet, the marino, and the other great &s;treet that cro&s;&s;es the cor&s;o. This is done by the erection of pyramids and arches. They are erected on each &s;ide the &s;treets, betwixt the front path and the pavement, and run in two right lines, exactly parallel from one end to the other; the four gates, at the end of the&s;e cro&s;s &s;treets, are al&s;o illuminated; &s;o that, from the &s;quare in the centre of the city, the whole of this illumination can be &s;een at once. The number of pyramids, and arches, exceed two thou&s;and. Two great theatres are al&s;o erected for fire-works; one fronting the viceroy's palace, and almo&s;t equal to it in &s;ize; and the other on piles, driven into the &s;ea, exactly oppo&s;ite to the great orche&s;|tra, in the centre of the marino.</P>
<P>The cathedral too is illuminated, both roof and walls; and within, they are entirely covered over, on this occa|&s;ion,
<PB N="130" REF="131">
with looking-gla&s;s, intermixed with gold and &s;ilver paper, and an infinite variety of artificial flowers, all ar|ranged with great ta&s;te and judgment. Every altar, cha|pel, and column, is decorated in the &s;ame manner. The roof is hung with innumerable lu&s;tres filled with candles; the &s;aints are dre&s;&s;ed out in all their glory, and the fairy queen, her&s;elf, was never finer than St. <HI>Ro&s;alio.</HI></P>
<P>On the evening of the twelfth of July, at five o'clock, the fe&s;tival begins. A triumphal car is drawn, from the middle of the marino, through the centre of the city to its furthe&s;t gate; preceded by a troop of hor&s;e, with trumpets and kettle-drums, and all the city-officers in their gala uniforms. The car is an enormous machine, on wheels, &s;eventy feet long, thirty wide, and more than eighty high; and, as it pa&s;&s;ed along, overtopped the loftie&s;t hou&s;es of Palermo. The form of its under part is like that of the Roman gallies, but &s;maller as it advances in height. The front a&s;&s;umes an oval &s;hape, like an amphitheatre, with &s;eats placed in the &s;tile of a theatre. This is the great orche&s;tra, filled with a numerous band of mu|&s;icians, in rows one above another. Over this orche&s;|tra, and a little behind it, there is a large dome, &s;up|ported by &s;ix large Corinthian columns, and adorned with a number of figures of &s;aints and angels; and, on the &s;ummit of the dome, a gigantic &s;ilver &s;tatue of
<FIGURE>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="131" REF="133">
St. <HI>Ro&s;alio.</HI> The whole machine is dre&s;&s;ed out with orange-trees, flower-pots, and trees of artificial coral. The car &s;topped every fifty or &s;ixty yards; when the orche&s;tra performed a piece of mu&s;ic; with &s;ongs, in honour of the &s;aint. It appeared a moving ca&s;tle, and completely filled the great &s;treet, from &s;ide to &s;ide. This va&s;t fabric was drawn by fifty-&s;ix huge mules, two a-brea&s;t, curiou&s;ly capari&s;oned, and mounted by twenty-eight po&s;tilions, dre&s;&s;ed in gold and &s;ilver &s;tuffs, with great plumes of o&s;trich feathers in their hats. Every window, and balcony, both &s;ides of the &s;treet, were full of well dre&s;&s;ed people; and the car was followed by many thou&s;ands of the lower &s;ort. The triumph was fini&s;hed in about three hours, and was &s;ucceeded by the beautiful illumination of the marino. (<HI>See the Plate.</HI>)</P>
<P>From end to end of the marino, pyramids and arches were erected, as in the great &s;treet; and &s;o en|tirely were they covered with lamps, that, at a little di&s;tance, they &s;eemed pyramids and arches of flame. The whole chain of this illumination was about a mile in length, and nothing can be conceived more &s;plendid; no break, or imperfection any where, nor a &s;ingle lamp extingui&s;hed: &s;o &s;till was the night.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to the centre, of this great line of light, was a magnificent pavilion, erected for the viceroy
<PB N="132" REF="134">
and his company, which con&s;i&s;ted of the whole no|bility of Palermo; and, at the entrance of this, at &s;ome little di&s;tance in the &s;ea, &s;tood the great fire|works; repre&s;enting the front of a palace, adorned with columns, arches, trophies, and every ornament of architecture. All the xebecs, gallies, galliots, and other &s;hipping, were ranged round this palace, and formed a kind of amphitheatre in the &s;ea, enclo&s;ing it in the centre. The&s;e began the &s;how, by a di&s;|charge of their artillery; the &s;ound of which re|echoed from the mountains; and, in a &s;till night, pro|duced a very noble effect. A variety of water-rock|ets, and bombs of a curious con&s;truction, were next played off, that often bur&s;t below water. This con|tinued for half an hour; when, in an in&s;tant, the whole of the palace was beautifully illuminated. This was the &s;ignal for the &s;hipping to cea&s;e; and ap|peared, indeed, like a piece of enchantment, being done in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, altogether, and without the appear|ance of any agent: at the &s;ame time, the fountains, that were repre&s;ented in the court, before the palace, began to &s;pout out fire, re&s;embling the great <HI>Jet d'eaus</HI> of Ver&s;ailles and Marly. As &s;oon as the&s;e were extingui&s;hed, the court of this palace took on the form of a great parterre, embelli&s;hed with a variety of palm-trees of fire, inter&s;per&s;ed with orange-trees, flower-pots, va&s;es, and other ornaments; and the front of it broke out into a variety of &s;uns, &s;tars, and
<PB N="133" REF="135">
wheels of fire; which, in a &s;hort time, reduced the whole erection to a perfect ruin. All now &s;eemed over; when, unexpectedly, there bur&s;t from the cen|tre of the pile, a va&s;t explo&s;ion of two thou&s;and rockets, bombs, &s;erpents, &s;quibs, and devils; which &s;eemed to fill the whole atmo&s;phere. During this exhibition, coffee, ices, &s;weetmeats, and a variety of excellent wines, were handed round in the pavilion, in the centre of the marino. This was at the ex|pence of the duke of <HI>Ca&s;tellano,</HI> the praetor, or mayor of the city. The principal nobility give the&s;e enter|tainments by turns, every night during the fe&s;tival, and vie with each other in magnificence.</P>
<P>The firework being fini&s;hed, the viceroy went out to &s;ea in a galley, richly illuminated. <HI>Brydone</HI> con|tinued on &s;hore, to &s;ee the effect. It was rowed by &s;eventy-two oars; and, he &s;ays, made one of the mo&s;t beautiful objects imaginable; flying with va&s;t velocity over the waters, then as &s;mooth and as clear as gla&s;s; which &s;hone round it like a flame, and reflected its &s;plendor on all &s;ides. The oars beat time to the French-horns, clarinets, and trumpets, of which there was a numerous band in the prow.</P>
<P>The day's entertainment was concluded by the cor&s;o; which began exactly at midnight, and la&s;ted two hours. This great &s;treet was illuminated in the
<PB N="134" REF="136">
&s;ame manner as the marino. The arches and pyra|mids were erected, at little di&s;tances from each other, on both &s;ides, betwixt the foot-path and the &s;pace for carriages; and, when &s;een from either of the city gates, at the end of the &s;treet, appeared to be two con|tinued lines of the brighte&s;t flame. Indeed, &s;ays <HI>Bry|done,</HI> the&s;e illuminations are &s;o very different, and &s;o much &s;uperior, to any I ever &s;aw, that I find it dif|ficult to give an idea of them. Two lines of coaches occupied the &s;pace between the&s;e two lines of illumi|nation. They in their greate&s;t gala; and, as the&s;e coaches open in the middle, and let down on each &s;ide, the beauty of the ladies, the richne&s;s of their dre&s;s, and brilliance of their jewels, were di&s;played in the mo&s;t advantageous manner.</P>
<P>The beautiful train moved &s;lowly, round and round, for two hours. They &s;eemed all joy and exultation; &s;carce two coaches pa&s;t, without &s;ome mutual acknow|ledgment of affection, or re&s;pect; and the plea&s;ure, that &s;parkled from every eye, &s;eemed to be reflected and communicated by &s;ympathy through the whole.</P>
<P>In &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly, continues <HI>Brydone,</HI> it was im|po&s;&s;ible for the heart not to dilate and expand it&s;elf. I own, mine was &s;o full, that I could hardly find ut|terance; and, I have &s;een a tragedy with le&s;s emo|tion, than this &s;cene of fe&s;tivity. The univer&s;al joy
<PB N="135" REF="137">
&s;eemed here to &s;pring from the heart; it brightened every countenance, and &s;poke affection and friend|&s;hip from every face.&mdash;No &s;tately air&mdash;no &s;uperci|lious look&mdash;all appeared friends and equals&mdash;and, &s;ure I am, that the beauty of the ladies was not half &s;o much heightened, either by their dre&s;s or their jew|els, as by that air of complacency and good-humour, with which it was animated.</P>
<P>The next day, I thought there would be a falling off. The entertainments of the thirteenth began by hor&s;e-races. Of the&s;e there were three; &s;ix hor&s;es &s;tarted each time, mounted by boys, about twelve years old, without either &s;addle or bridle; only a &s;mall piece of cord, by way of bit in the hor&s;e's mouth, which it &s;eems is &s;ufficient to &s;top them. The great &s;treet was the cour&s;e; and for this purpo&s;e it was covered with earth, five or &s;ix inches deep. The firing of a gun was the &s;ignal for &s;tarting; the hor&s;es under&s;tood this, for they all &s;at off at once, full &s;peed, from one gate; and continued at their utmo&s;t &s;tretch to the other; exactly a mile, and ran it in a minute and thirty-five &s;econds; the hor&s;es &s;carce fourteen hands high; barbs, or a mixed breed, between a Sicilian and a barb. The boys were gaudily dre&s;&s;ed, and made a pretty ap|pearance. They kept their &s;eat by leaning forward, and laying fa&s;t hold of the mane.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="138">The moment before &s;tarting, the &s;treet appeared full of people; nor did we conceive how the race could be run; and we were alarmed at &s;eeing the hor&s;es run full &s;peed, at the very thicke&s;t of the crowd, which did not begin to open, till they were almo&s;t clo&s;e upon it. The people then opened, and fell back on each &s;ide, by a regular uniform motion, from one end of the &s;treet to the other. This &s;ingular manoeuvre &s;eemed to be performed without any bu&s;tle or confu|&s;ion; and, the moment the hor&s;es were pa&s;t, the peo|ple clo&s;ed again behind them. The victor was con|ducted along the &s;treet in triumph, with his prize before him; viz. a piece of white &s;ilk, embroidered and worked with gold.</P>
<P>The great &s;treet was illuminated in the &s;ame man|ner as before; and the grand a&s;&s;embly of the nobles was held at the archbi&s;hop's palace, which was richly fitted up on the occa&s;ion. The gardens were finely illuminated, like our Vauxhall on an extra day; an orche&s;tra was erected at each end, and two very good bands of mu&s;ic played. The entertainment was &s;plendid.</P>
<P>About ten at night, the great triumphal car was drawn back again, in proce&s;&s;ion, to the marino; richly illuminated with wax tapers, and made a mo&s;t formi|dable figure. <HI>Don Qaixole</HI> would have been excu&s;a|ble
<PB N="137" REF="139">
in taking it for an enchanted ca&s;tle, moving through the air. The cor&s;o was illuminated, as the night before, and the &s;ame parading of carriages took place.</P>
<P>On the fourteenth, at night, the two great &s;treets, and the city gates that terminate them, were illumi|nated in the mo&s;t &s;plendid manner. The &s;quare, in the centre, where the &s;treets cro&s;s each other, was richly ornamented with tape&s;try, &s;tatues, and artificial flowers; and, as the buildings which form its four &s;ides are uniform, and of fine architecture, and at the &s;ame time highly illuminated, it had a wonderful effect. There were four orche&s;tras erected in it; and the fine bands of mu&s;ic were greater, than it could be &s;uppo&s;ed Palermo could furni&s;h. From the centre of this &s;quare, we have a view of the whole city, thus dre&s;&s;ed out in its glory; and the effect it produces, &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es belief.</P>
<P>The nobles a&s;&s;embled in the viceroy's palace; and the entertainment, was &s;till more magnificent, than either of the former evenings. The great fire-works, oppo&s;ite the front of the palace, began at ten o'clock, and ended at midnight; after this, the parading in the cor&s;o, as before, till two. The fireworks were more
<PB N="138" REF="140">
&s;uperb than tho&s;e on the &s;ea; though it had not &s;o good an effect.</P>
<P>On the fifteenth, three races, &s;ix hor&s;es each, as before. The great a&s;&s;embly of the nobility was at the ju&s;tice <HI>Monarchias,</HI> an officer of high rank and dignity. Here, al&s;o, was a &s;umptuous entertainment, and a concert. At eleven at night, the viceroy, and the whole company, walked to vi&s;it the &s;quare and the great church; a prodigious train; for, though the city was all a lamp of light, the &s;ervants of the viceroy and nobles, preceded with flambeaus. As &s;oon as the viceroy entered the &s;quare, the five orche&s;tras played, and continued playing till he left it.</P>
<P>The crowd round the church was very great, but the attendants &s;oon cleared the way; and, entering at the great gate, we beheld the mo&s;t &s;plendid &s;cene in the world. The whole church appeared a flame of light, which reflected from ten thou&s;and bright and &s;hining &s;urfaces, of different colours, and different angles, produced an effect, which no de&s;cription of enchantment can equal. The whole church, walls, roof, pillars, &amp;c. were entirely covered over with looking-gla&s;s, as I have ob&s;erved, inter&s;per&s;ed with gold and &s;ilver paper, and artificial flowers; &s;o that not one inch of &s;tone, or pla&s;ter, could be &s;een. Form an idea of one of our great cathedrals dre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="139" REF="141">
out in this manner, and illuminated with twenty thou|&s;and wax-tapers, and it will give &s;ome faint notion of this &s;plendid &s;cene. I never could have &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> that human art could have devi&s;ed any thing &s;o &s;plendid. The &s;cene was too glaring to bear any con&s;iderable time; and the heat, occa&s;ioned by the lights, &s;oon became intolerable. In this cathedral there were twenty-eight altars, fourteen on each &s;ide; the&s;e were dre&s;&s;ed out with the utmo&s;t magnificence; and the great altar was &s;till more &s;plendid than all. From the church, the company went to the cor&s;o; which concluded, as u&s;ual, the entertainments of the day.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixteenth, the &s;treets were fully illuminated. The a&s;&s;embly was held at the praeters, with an elegant entertainment and a concert. <HI>Pacherotti</HI> and <HI>Gabrielli</HI> &s;ung; for they were here for the opera. The great proce&s;&s;ion, that clo&s;ed the fe&s;tival, began at ten o'clock. It differed only from the other proce&s;&s;ion in this; that, be&s;ides all the prie&s;ts, friars, and religious orders of the city; there were placed, at equal di&s;tances from each, other, ten lofty machines of wood and pa&s;teboard; re|pre&s;enting temples, tabernacles, and a variety of beautiful pieces of architecture. The&s;e are furni&s;hed by the different convents, and religious fraternities, who vie with each other in the richne&s;s and elegance of the work; &s;ome of them are not le&s;s than &s;ixty feet
<PB N="140" REF="142">
high. They were filled with figures of &s;aints and angels, made of wax; &s;o natural, and &s;o admirably well painted, that many of them &s;eemed alive. All the&s;e figures are prepared by the nuns, and dre&s;&s;ed out in rich robes of gold and &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ue. A great &s;ilver box, containing the bones of St. <HI>Ro&s;alia,</HI> clo&s;ed the proce&s;&s;ion. It was carried by thirty-&s;ix of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable burge&s;&s;es of the city, who look upon this as the greate&s;t honour. The archbi&s;hop walked behind it, giving his benediction to the people as they pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the proce&s;&s;ion fini&s;hed the tour of the great &s;quare, before the praeter's palace, than the fountain in the centre, one of the large&s;t and fine&s;t in Europe, was converted into a fountain of fire; throw|ing it up on all &s;ides, and making a very beautiful ap|pearance. It only la&s;ted a few minutes, and was extin|gui&s;hed by a va&s;t explo&s;ion that concluded the whole; and we may &s;ay, with truth, that the entertainments of the fea&s;t of St. <HI>Ro&s;alio,</HI> are much beyond tho&s;e of the holy week at Rome; of the A&s;cen&s;ion at Ve|nice; or, indeed, any other Romi&s;h fe&s;tival.</P>
<P>On the&s;e occa&s;ions, we cannot but remark, &s;ays <HI>De Non,</HI> the gravity of the Sicilians; who enjoy all this, without the &s;malle&s;t external &s;ymptom of joy, or plea&s;ure. They would, perhaps, revolt, if the &s;enate
<PB N="141" REF="143">
was to put a &s;top to this fe&s;tival; yet, they look on it with compo&s;ure, without a &s;mile, or any token of &s;a|tisfaction; ob&s;erving the mo&s;t perfect good order, without requiring the interpo&s;ition of the ju&s;tice. No tumult ever happens; and, though there are upwards of one hundred thou&s;and per&s;ons collected on the &s;ame &s;pot, there never is any crouding. The inhabitants, of them&s;elves, divide the &s;treet between them; one &s;ide for tho&s;e coming up, and the other for the pa&s;&s;en|gers going down. They are very different from our populace, who want to &s;ee every thing before it begins, keep looking when it has begun, and &s;till pu&s;h forward to &s;tare about them when all is over; who never re|main quiet &s;o long as a lamp is burning, and can hardly prevail on them&s;elves to retire, even when the lights are out. Here the labourer, or mechanic, as &s;oon as midnight comes, leads off his wife, or mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e arm he has never quitted, and re&s;igns his place, without clamour to the nobility; who enter with the &s;ame order, and di&s;play, with true Italian pomp, their magnificent equipages, and gala liveries.</P>
<P>Another curio&s;ity, near Palermo, is the &s;epultures of the dead, of the convent of Capuchins, about a mile from it. This is a va&s;t &s;ubterraneous apartment, di|vided into large commodious galleries; the walls, on each &s;ide of which, are hollowed into a variety of niches, as if intended for a great collection of &s;tatues.
<PB N="142" REF="144">
The&s;e niches are filled with dead bodies of men, (for they will not permit women to be placed there) &s;et upright upon their legs, and fixed by the back to the in&s;ide of the niche. Their number is about three hundred; all dre&s;&s;ed in the clothes they u&s;ually wore. The &s;kin and mu&s;cles, by a certain preparation, be|come as dry and hard, as a piece of &s;tock-fi&s;h; and, although many of them have been there upwards of two hundred and fifty years, yet none are reduced to &s;keletons. The mu&s;cles are, indeed, more &s;hrunk in &s;ome than in others; po&s;&s;ibly, becau&s;e they might have been more wa&s;ted at the time of their death. The &s;ight of objects, like the&s;e, mu&s;t rai&s;e in the &s;pectator &s;uch emotions, as are not ea&s;ily &s;tifled. It is equally di&s;agreeable to find, that they mortify our vanity, by de&s;troying tho&s;e fanciful chimaeras of happine&s;s, and tho&s;e great projects which the imagination is plea&s;ed to form. I experienced this, &s;ays <HI>Bi&s;ani,</HI> among others; but, no &s;ooner were tho&s;e ideas pa&s;&s;ed, than I could look on the&s;e &s;pe&s;tres with calmne&s;s. Some in&s;pired me with terror, &s;ome made me laugh, and &s;eemed to laugh in their turn; all, however, afforded this le&s;|&s;on; that &s;ince we are born only to look round us, and to fall and confound our a&s;hes with tho&s;e of our an|ce&s;tors, we &s;hould enjoy life; that life, who&s;e days are &s;o fugitive; and yet in &s;uch enjoyment, not forget, that virtue is the fir&s;t of duties, and the parent of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145">Here, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> the people of Palermo pay daily vi&s;its to their decea&s;ed friends, and regret the &s;cenes of their pa&s;t life; here they familiari&s;e them|&s;elves with their future &s;tate, and chu&s;e the company they would keep in the other world. It is a common thing to make choice of their niches, and try if their body fits it, that no alterations may be nece&s;&s;ary after their death; and, &s;ometimes by way of penance, they accu&s;tom them&s;elves to &s;tand for hours in the&s;e niches.</P>
<P>The bodies of the princes, and fir&s;t nobility, are de|po&s;ited in hand&s;ome che&s;ts, or trunks; &s;ome of them richly adorned. The keys are kept by the neare&s;t re|lations of the family; who, &s;ometimes, come and drop a tear over their departed friends.</P>
<P>The&s;e pre&s;erved bodies are, by no means, great objects of horror; they retain a &s;trong likene&s;s to what they were when alive; &s;o that, as &s;oon as the fir&s;t feeling excited by the&s;e venerable figures is conquered, it may be con&s;idered as a va&s;t gallery of original por|traits, drawn by the pencil of truth.</P>

whole: to relieve my readers, I have often, therefore, introduced anecdotes, and &s;tories, perhaps not very pertinent to the &s;ubject; but merely to enliven the work, that might otherwi&s;e become dull and tire&s;ome. It is on this principle, I &s;hall give the following laughable &s;tory from <HI>Brydone.</HI> He dined with a nobleman at Pa|lermo; and an abb&eacute; pre&s;ent gave him this anecdote of a friend of his, who was formerly a brother of the Ca|puchin convent, known by the name of <HI>Fra Pa&s;qual,</HI> and who had pa&s;&s;ed through many &s;ingular &s;cenes of life. He was one of the banditti of this kingdom, in which he had been enrolled &s;ome time; (of this banditti we &s;hall &s;peak hereafter) but, tired of the danger to which he was continually expo&s;ed, he changed the character of hero, for that of &s;aint, and became a capuchin friar. He took the vows of poverty and cha&s;tity, and entered into all the rigours of a mona&s;tic life; determining to atone for his &s;ins, by &s;pending the remainder of it, in mortification and penance. He went bare-footed, wore a large ro&s;ary, and a thicker cord of di&s;cipline, than any monk in the convent; and, his whole de|portment gave te&s;timony of the mo&s;t unfeigned repen|tance; this la&s;ted only a few weeks. The devil was &s;till at work in the heart of <HI>Pa&s;qual;</HI> and, all the&s;e ex|ternal mortifications only made him work the harder. In &s;hort, <HI>Pa&s;qual</HI> finding it impo&s;&s;ible to drive him out; and afraid, left the enemy &s;hould, at la&s;t, get the bet|ter of him, he thought it advi&s;eable to leave, at Pa|lermo,
<PB N="145" REF="147">
the character of &s;anctity he had acquired, and began a new life at a new place. He embarked for Naples, and was &s;oon there admitted into a capuchin convent.</P>
<P><HI>Pa&s;qual</HI> knowing from experience, that the dull uni|formity of a mona&s;tic life required &s;ome renovation, and amu&s;ement to render it &s;upportable, &s;et about it; the fir&s;t thing he did, was to find him&s;elf a mi&s;tre&s;s, in a &s;nug corner, where he might &s;leep at night, occa|&s;ionally, from his convent, and indulge in that enjoy|ment which his au&s;tere order forbids. He &s;oon fixed his eye on a celebrated courtezan; who, like our Lon|don ladies of ea&s;y virtue, though they admit for pay no vi&s;its from &s;trangers, but tho&s;e that are wealthy; will take up with lovers, at times, more &s;uited to their own ca&s;t and inclinations. This lady admitted to her bed, at certain times, when &s;he was otherwi&s;e engaged, a life-guard-man, &s;ix feet two inches high; a fellow with a &s;pada, or toledo, of uncommon length; and wore a pair of curled whi&s;kers, that would frighten any man, who&s;e nerves were not uncommonly &s;trong. This man was kept by her as her champion, and paid by tho&s;e favours &s;he had occa&s;ionally to &s;pare; but, having an art of winning her affections, more than by fighting her battles, he had got the a&s;cendancy over her; and never &s;uffered her to receive any vi&s;its, but from tho&s;e he was made acquainted with; which were
<PB N="146" REF="148">
generally old fools, who had more money than wit; and, would often &s;acrifice the former at the &s;hrine of their idolatry. This lady, however, had a penchant of her own; and, having no idea of being confined to one youthful admirer, was determined to receive any other &s;he plea&s;ed. At this time the capuchin, one night, fell in her way. When &s;he knew her life-guard-man would be on duty, &s;he invited him to her bed; and, to make her favours more valuable, told him, &s;he had a lover, who was exceedingly jealous of her; that, if he knew of her intriguing, or admitting the vi&s;its of any other per&s;on, he would be the death of them both; for that he was a &s;oldier, and a man in di&s;po&s;ition as furious as a lion; but, that as he was then on duty, there would be no danger, and &s;he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>The capuchin, who had been originally bred to arms, having no fear, and liking difficulties, was more eager than ever to accept this lady's invitation. He, accordingly, &s;tept out of his convent, and hied to the apartments of his mi&s;tre&s;s. But it &s;o happened, that about one in the morning, when he was a&s;leep, with his fair enchantre&s;s, the life-guard-man, unexpectedly re|turned. The noi&s;e he made at the door, &s;oon awaked and alarmed them; the lady was frightened out of her wits, told the capuchin it was her lover, and that &s;he expected nothing le&s;s than that both would be put to
<PB N="147" REF="149">
death. The capuchin, being unarmed, was al&s;o not a little frightened. Not finding a ready admittance, the &s;oldier &s;tormed and made a louder noi&s;e; and the capuchin, having no time to reflect, gathered up his rags and crept under the bed; which, being rather corpulent, he found a difficulty in doing. He was no &s;ooner there than &s;he opened the door, which was a ground-floor-room, and the giant &s;talked in, angry that he was kept at the door &s;o long. However, as he returned in an amorous mood, her winning ways &s;oon put him into good humour. There was no light in the room; and, of cour&s;e, the monk did not fear a di&s;covery. Strike a light &s;aid the &s;oldier, that I may &s;ee to un|dre&s;s. The monk trembled, and the bed &s;hook. What makes the bed &s;hake &s;o, &s;ays he, 'tis I, returned the lady, that ran again&s;t it in &s;earching for the tin|der-box. It was found, and the monk quaked within him: but, &s;he having de&s;ignedly, from the chamber|pot, thrown &s;ome water into it; the tinder would not take fire. Till the capuchin knew this, every &s;troke of the flint was to him a double knell; but, when both had tried, and his rival &s;wore at the tinder's not kindling, &s;aying, it was wet; his &s;pirits recovered. She advi&s;ed him to go to the guard-hou&s;e for a light, being only at the end of the &s;treet: here the monk had fre&s;h hopes, which &s;unk again, on hearing the &s;oldier &s;ay that he left his duty without leave, and dared not go, and would rather undre&s;s in the dark. He then began to
<PB N="148" REF="150">
grope about under the bed, for a bottle of liquors that he knew was there, and had very nearly laid hold of the capuchin's head; but, madam finding what he was at, &s;prung to the bed and reached it for him. He was now undre&s;&s;ed, and they got into bed. The weight of this giant gave the poor monk le&s;s room, for he lay ju&s;t over him; he was &s;queezed quite flat, and was nearly &s;uffocated. He had now a little time to think; and, it fir&s;t &s;truck him, that he would ru&s;h out into the &s;treet; but then he was &s;tark naked, for the capuchins wear no &s;hirts; this would alarm the police; next he thought of &s;eizing the to|ledo, and then, threatening the life-guard-man, de|mand honourable terms of capitulation, for both him|&s;elf and the lady. A thou&s;and ideas rolled in his mind. He could neither attend to any thing that was pa&s;&s;ing, nor be &s;en&s;ible of the pre&s;&s;ure that was over him. At la&s;t, the man of war fell a&s;leep, and the capuchin heard him &s;nore; this was mu&s;ic to his heart; till he heard this, he was determined to keep his place till the morn|ing; but now, he ventured, if po&s;&s;ible, to e&s;cape. He, accordingly, worked his way out from under the bed; and, laying hold of the &s;word, relinqui&s;hed the cowardly idea of e&s;caping, and felt him&s;elf bold; his thoughts now were to be revenged of his rival, and make him &s;uffer in his turn. He accordingly dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the &s;oldier's uniform, and placed his grea&s;y cloaths, cowl, &amp;c. in a chair before the bed, where
<PB N="149" REF="151">
the &s;oldier had placed his, and &s;allied forth into the &s;treet. Here he had time to think. Shall I go back, &s;ays he to him&s;elf, in the character of another life-guard man, and pretend I am &s;ent by the officer on guard, in &s;earch of him, and take him to the guard-hou&s;e as a de&s;erter? No, this would be treacherous, and not a &s;ufficient retaliation. I will go and acquaint the guard, who hate the capuchin friars, for the ill opinion they entertain of the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the army, that I have traced one of that order to a hou&s;e of ill fame, and induce them to accompany me and unkennel the fox. This he did; he told the officer then on duty, that, as the capuchins were very apt to cen&s;ure the army, he had now an opportunity of being revenged; that he had noticed a Franci&s;can friar in his habit, &s;kulking in the &s;treets; had watched him, and traced him to the hou&s;e of a common woman; that he had li&s;tened at the window, and heard them go to bed; and, that if the officer would accompany him, he would enjoy not only great diver&s;ion, but would, when he heard the capuchins inveigh again&s;t the army, be able, in future, to turn the laugh again&s;t them. The officer, plea&s;ed with the idea, took the guard with him, and followed the capuchin to the hou&s;e. they rapped loud at the door, and demanded admit|tance for the night-guard. The noi&s;e waked the &s;leepy couple; and, the &s;oldier fearing it was the guard come to apprehend him for quitting his duty, was, in
<PB N="150" REF="152">
his turn, much more afraid than the monk, when his rival announced his return. In his panic, he got out of bed, took up in the dark the capuchin's clothes that laid in the chair, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be his own, and hid him&s;elf where the prie&s;t had done before. The capuchin not readily gaining admittance, put his foot to the door, and forced it open. The guard entered, and demanded of the lady the body of a capuchin friar, that lodged with her that night. She hearing the monk, when he quitted her chamber, and not &s;up|po&s;ing he would inform again&s;t him&s;elf, prote&s;ted &s;he had no capuchin with her, and called upon all the &s;aints in &s;upport of her a&s;&s;ertion. But, the monk &s;u&s;|pecting the retreat of his rival, &s;tooped, and pulled from under the bed the cowl, the cloak, the &s;andals, the ro&s;ary, and the cord of di&s;cipline, one after the other, crying out, No capuchin! No capuchin! The&s;e are damning proofs, proofs not to be controverted; and, then &s;tooping to the ground, cryed out, &s;oho!&mdash; I no&s;e him; he &s;tinks like a fox. The only way to find a capuchin, is to no&s;e him.&mdash;We may wind them a mile off. The lanthorn was now held down, and the man of ardour was found &s;queezed beneath the bed, almo&s;t &s;tifled. <HI>Ecco lo,</HI> cries the capuchin, <HI>here</HI> he is&mdash;<HI>here</HI> he is.&mdash;The reverend father is come, you &s;ee, to do penance: let us a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his di&s;cipline. With this they drew him out, and belaboured him well with the cord, crying out <HI>Andiamo Signior Padre,
<PB N="151" REF="153">
Andiamo.</HI> The poor &s;oldier, being without his clothes, felt the weight of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> heavier than what he liked, and bawled out that he was no capuchin, and that they were all mi&s;taken. This occa&s;ioned a repe|tion of the &s;courging. The monk laid it on now the heavier, &s;aying, he de&s;erved this for denying his ma&s;ter, and his order. The guards lay all round the bed, in convul&s;ions of laughter, at the &s;cene.</P>
<P>The lady was frightened, and alarmed; &s;he ran about the room exclaiming, <HI>Oime! &s;iamo perduti&mdash; &s;iamo incantati&mdash;&s;iamo in&s;orcelati!</HI> that is, "Ah me! I am ruined&mdash;I am under an enchantment&mdash;I am be|witched!</P>
<P>The monk, delighted at the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;cheme, thought it was be&s;t that he &s;hould get off, before he was di&s;covered; therefore, made an excu&s;e to the officer for leaving him, &s;aying, his hour of duty was come, and he was obliged to join his corps; but, recommended to to him, with a &s;neer, to treat the holy father with all all that re&s;pect and reverence due to &s;o &s;acred a per&s;on.</P>
<P>The life-guard-man, no &s;ooner got from under the bed, than he looked for his clothes, and not &s;eeing any but the grea&s;y robes of a capuchin friar, was per|&s;uaded that God had given him over to the devil, as a
<PB N="152" REF="154">
puni&s;hment for his offences; for of all men, the Nea|politan &s;oldiers are mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious; and he recol|lected it was Friday, a fa&s;t-day; and that, in pa&s;&s;ing the &s;tatue of St. <HI>Januarius,</HI> he had not offered up a prayer to it. This is the con&s;equence, &s;ays he, moan|ing, of offending heaven. I acknowledge my &s;in; I knew it was Friday, and yet, O fle&s;h, fle&s;h:&mdash;had it been any other day, I &s;hould not have been thus me|tamorpho&s;ed; now, mu&s;t I no longer carry a &s;word, but a crucifix. Oh St. <HI>Januarius,</HI> thy all-&s;earching eye has found me out!&mdash;Do, gentlemen, what you plea&s;e with me. I am not what I &s;eem to be. "True enough (&s;aid the officer) we are &s;en&s;ible of that. Come, Signior <HI>Padre,</HI> put on your filthy garments, and march; for we have no time to lo&s;e." Here cor|poral (giving him the cord) tie his hands, and let St. <HI>Francis</HI> bind him. The poor &s;on of Mars was per|fectly pa&s;&s;ive; they arrayed him in the &s;andals, the cloak and cowl of the capuchin, and put the great ro|&s;ary round his neck; he hung his head, and a woeful figure he made.&mdash;Look in the gla&s;s, &s;aid the officer, turning him about, and &s;ee if you know your&s;elf? Are you a capuchin <HI>now?</HI> He was &s;hocked at his own ap|pearance, but bore all with re&s;ignation. Thus equip|ped, they conducted him to the guard-hou&s;e, &s;courg|ing him all the way with the cord, and a&s;king him, at every &s;troke, if he knew his ma&s;ter <HI>now?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="155">The capuchin, during this time, had &s;neaked, un|perceived, into his convent; and, having a &s;econd dre&s;s, put it on; taking the clothes of the life-guard-man, and laying them in a heap, before it was light, near the gate of another capuchin convent, at &s;ome di&s;tance from his own; not forgetting to pocket the trifle of money he found in the &s;oldier's breeches, to atone for the lo&s;s of his garments. Capuchins are forbidden, by their order, to carry money; and this man &s;ays, he &s;hould not have thought of doing it, but to prevent any other from making an unlawful prize of it.</P>
<P>The poor &s;oldier's comrades &s;oon heard of his transformation, and came in troops to &s;ee him, and jeer him, in his metamorpho&s;is; but, as he thought him&s;elf under the finger of Heaven, and does to this day, he bore all with meekne&s;s. They kept him a pri&s;oner for a day or two; but, his clothes being found, he was &s;et at liberty. It has been of &s;ome u&s;e to him, for he never pa&s;&s;es St. <HI>Januarius,</HI> without muttering a prayer; nor ever vi&s;its his mi&s;tre&s;s on a Friday.</P>
<P>About five miles from Palermo is the city of Mon|reale, a &s;mall place on the brow of a very high hill, but the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop; remarkable for its grand approach, or paved road, made by the Dioce&s;an, winding up the mountain, &s;upported by &s;trong but|tre&s;&s;es
<PB N="154" REF="156">
and brea&s;t-works, and adorned with borders of flowering-&s;hrubs, urns, fountains, and in&s;criptions. About the midway, clo&s;e to the road, ri&s;es a huge barren rock; out of the bowels of which, a fine &s;tream gu&s;hes with great force. An arti&s;t has been employed to improve this natural fountain, which he has done, by adding to the original cliff, large ma&s;&s;es of rugged &s;tone, which pen up the water into one full, but irre|gular body; it then da&s;hes headlong into a capacious ba&s;on, overgrown with the broad leaves of the lotus, flag, and water-lily. On the &s;ummit of this artificial rock is the &s;tatue of a boy, armed with a hatchet, watching a &s;erpent, that &s;eems creeping towards the water; another boy, as if rou&s;ed by alarm, is repre|&s;ented climbing up, with a &s;tone in his hand; whil&s;t a little girl, with di&s;may &s;trongly marked in every fea|ture, is hiding her&s;elf behind the &s;tump of a tree.</P>
<P>A gate terminates this fine approach to Monreale; the other end of the road joins an avenue of aged trees, (&s;ome of which are plantanes) leading through the plain to the gates of Palermo; which plain, for many miles, is a continued orange-garden, and fine &s;cenery; the air perfumed. Monreale is hemmed in on every &s;ide but the northern, by lofty mountains; but, on the North, a view opens over hanging woods of olive,
<PB N="155" REF="157">
and of orange-trees, to Palermo, and the &s;ea; a noble and mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;cene.</P>
<P>The city is clean and neatly built, and contains above eight thou&s;and inhabitants; but the cathe|dral, the &s;econd in the i&s;land, exhibits a very di&s;|agreeable &s;pecimen of Gothic ta&s;te; and, to mend it, they have white-wa&s;hed the out&s;ide. Let me notice, in the way back to Palermo, the Torre Zizza, and I have done. This is a country hou&s;e, of very ancient foundation, and remarkable architecture; it was built by the Saracens, during their abode in Sicily, in the ninth or tenth century, and is almo&s;t co|eval with the mo&s;que at Cordova, in Spain; but differs widely from it, in the character of its architecture. The windows of la Zizza are long, and almo&s;t round at top; in&s;tead of being pointed, or arched like a hor&s;e|&s;hoe. It is a &s;quare &s;tone tower, three &s;tories high, of regular cour&s;es of ma&s;onry, not at all decayed by age, with a battlement on the top; on each &s;tone of which is a letter of &s;ome alphabet, u&s;ed by the Sara|cens; which Mr. <HI>Swinburne</HI> &s;uppo&s;es to be the Cufick, now only to be found in the olde&s;t Mahomedan ma|nu&s;cripts. The in&s;ide is decorated with thin arches, and fro&s;ted cielings, hanging down in drops; a foun|tain plays in the hall, and fragrant gardens, with rich decorations, adjoin it. The tale of this town, handed down by tradition, is, that a &s;ultan erected it, for the

purpo&s;e of con&s;ining his beautiful daughter Zizza; but, as this word is &s;aid to imply <HI>gay, flowery, decked|out,</HI> this tower might have been called &s;o from its or|naments. Even now, when the Sicilians &s;peak of a well-dre&s;t lady, they &s;ay &s;he is a <HI>zizzata.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of Catania.</HEAD>
<P>CATANIA is a city &s;tanding on the We&s;tern coa&s;t of Sicily; it lies at the foot of Mount Aetna, and has been &s;everal times de&s;troyed by it. It evidently appears, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> that the irruptions of the mountain have formed the whole coa&s;t; and, in many places, have driven back the &s;ea, for &s;everal miles, from its ancient boundaries. The account given by Sicilian authors, of the conflict between the&s;e two adver&s;e elements, fire and water, is truly tremendous; and, in relating it, they &s;eem to have been &s;haken with horror. Conceive the front of a torrent of fire,
<PB N="157" REF="159">
ten miles in breadth, and heaped up to an enormous height, rolling down the mountain, and pouring its flames into the ocean! The noi&s;e more dreadful than the loude&s;t thunder; and heard, through the whole country, to an immen&s;e di&s;tance. The water &s;eeming to retire and hide its head before its antagoni&s;t, and to confe&s;s its &s;uperiority; yielding up its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and contracting its banks: &s;alt vapours darkening the face of the &s;un, covering up this &s;cene under a veil of horror, and of night; and laying wa&s;te every field and vineyard in the&s;e regions of the i&s;land. This city was in great want of a port; till, by an ir|ruption in the &s;ixteenth century, a &s;tream of lava run|ning into the &s;ea, formed a mole, which no expence could have furni&s;hed. This la&s;ted for &s;ome time, a &s;afe and commodious harbour; till, at la&s;t, by a &s;ub&s;e|quent irruption, it was entirely filled up, and de|moli&s;hed. At this time, the torrent bur&s;t over the walls; and, laying wa&s;te great part of this beautiful city, poured into the &s;ea. But, the &s;uper&s;tition of the peo|ple is &s;o great, and &s;o great is their reliance on St. <HI>Agatha,</HI> their &s;aint, that they cannot be made to believe, but that when &s;uch irruptions injure them, it is, be|cau&s;e they have offended <HI>Agatha,</HI> who&s;e influence and power can prevent &s;uch accidents if &s;he plea&s;es; nor would they be per&s;uaded to remove their &s;ituation, if the lava were at their walls; from an opinion, that <HI>Agatha</HI> can keep it fromentering the city. Neither is it
<PB N="158" REF="160">
the veil of the &s;aint alone, that, in their opinion, can do this, which they have long pre&s;erved as a relick; but they conceive, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> every thing, that has touched that piece of &s;acred attire, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;ame miraculous property. Thus, there is a number of little bits of cotton, and linen fixed to the veil, which, after being ble&s;&s;ed by the bi&s;hop, are &s;uppo&s;ed to acquire power enough to &s;ave any per&s;on's hou&s;e, or garden; and, wherever this expedient has failed, it is always at|tributed to want of faith of the per&s;on, not want of faith in the veil.</P>
<P>Catania was founded by the Chalcidians; &s;oon after the &s;ettlement of Syracu&s;e, it fell into the hands of the Romans, among their earlie&s;t acqui&s;itions in Sicily, and became the re&s;idence of the praeter; it was adorn|ed with &s;umptuous buildings, and every convenience was procured to &s;upply the natural and artificial wants of life. It was de&s;troyed by <HI>Pompey</HI>'s &s;on, but re&s;tored with &s;uperior magnificence, by <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> In the reign of <HI>Decius,</HI> St. <HI>Agatha,</HI> its patrone&s;s, was mar|tyred; on every emergency her interce&s;&s;ion is im|plored; &s;he is piou&s;ly believed to have pre&s;erved Ca|tania, from being overwhelmed by torrents of lava, or &s;haken to pieces by earthquakes; yet, its ancient edifices are covered, by repeated &s;treams of volcanic matter, and almo&s;t every hou&s;e; even her own church has been thrown to the ground; once, by an irruption
<PB N="159" REF="161">
of Aetna, twenty thou&s;and Catanians, with their pa&s;tor at their head, were de&s;troyed, before the &s;acred veil could be properly placed to check the flames. And in the la&s;t century, the irruptions, and earthquakes, raged with redoubled violence, and Catania was quite demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The prince of <HI>Bi&s;cari</HI> has been at infinite pains, and &s;pent a large &s;um of money, in working down to the ancient town. We de&s;cended into baths, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> into &s;epulchres, an amphitheatre, and a theatre, all very much injured. They were erected on old beds of lava, and even built with &s;quare pieces of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance; which does not appear to have been fu&s;ed by the contact of new lava.</P>
<P>This city has been frequently defended, from the burning &s;treams, by the &s;olid ma&s;s of its own ram|parts; and by the air compre&s;&s;ed between them and the lava. This appears, by the torrent having &s;top|ped, within a &s;mall di&s;tance of the walls, and taken ano|ther direction; but when the walls were broken, or low, the lava collected it&s;elf, till it ro&s;e to a great height, and then poured over in a curve. There is a wall at the foot of the old walls, where the lava, after running along the parapet, and then falling forwards, has produced a very complete lofty arch over the &s;pring.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="162">Since its de&s;truction, by an irruption, in 1669, and its overthrow, by an earthquake, in 1693, Catania is reviving with great &s;plendor; and, when all the hou&s;es now building are fini&s;hed, will be a very hand|&s;ome city. It has much more the features of a metro|polis, and royal re&s;idence, than Palermo; the princi|pal &s;treets are wide, &s;traight, and well paved with lava. An obeli&s;k of red granite, placed on the back of an antique elephant of touch&s;tone, or lava; a fine monu|ment of antiquity &s;tands in the centre of the great &s;quare; which is formed by the town-hall &s;eminary and cathedral. One would naturally &s;uppo&s;e, that men would be backward in erecting new habitations, e&s;pecially with any degree of grandeur, on a ground &s;o often &s;haken to its centre, and &s;o often buried under the a&s;hes of a volcano; but &s;uch is the attachment of an Italian to his native &s;oil, and &s;uch his contempt to dangers to which they are habituated; that, like the martin, which builds its ne&s;ts under the eves of hou&s;es; pull it down as often as you plea&s;e, it will im|mediately proceed to re-building it; &s;o will the Ita|lians rebuild their hou&s;es, on the warm cinders of Ve|&s;uvius, the quaking plains of Calabria, and the black mountains of Sciarra, at Catania. There is a great deal of activity in the di&s;po&s;ition of this people; they know by tradition, that their ance&s;tors carried on a flouri&s;hing commerce; and that, before the fiery river filled it up, they had a &s;pacious, convenient harbour,
<PB N="161" REF="163">
where they now have &s;carcely a creek for a felucca; they, therefore, wi&s;h to re&s;tore the&s;e advantages to Ca|tania; and have often applied to government for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, towards forming a mole and a port.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants, in Catania, amounts to about thirty thou&s;and men; the Catanians &s;ay &s;ixty thou&s;and. Great part of this number belongs to the univer&s;ity, the only one in the i&s;land, and the nur&s;ery of all the lawyers.</P>
<P>The prince of <HI>Bi&s;cari</HI> has inclo&s;ed a large tract of the lava, of 1669, near the &s;ea-&s;ide, &s;urrounded the old fortre&s;s, where the kings of Arragon u&s;ed to re|&s;ide; and, in this black impenetrable &s;urface, has made a garden, built hou&s;es, carried on a good coach road round it; planted trees, in earth brought from other places; and, what &s;eems almo&s;t incomprehen|&s;ible, has formed two large ponds of fre&s;h water, &s;up|plied by &s;prings, that ooze through the lava; &s;tocked them them with fi&s;h, and water-&s;owl, and pre&s;erved them from the fury of the &s;ea, by a &s;trong pier, the only barrier between the &s;alt and fre&s;h water. The &s;pot, where his villa &s;tands on the lava, was formerly fifty feet deep in water; and the height of the lava, above the pre&s;ent level of the &s;ea, is not le&s;s than fifty feet more.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="164">This prince has a mu&s;eum of the antiquities, he has dug out of the ruins of Catania. His collection is very rich and exten&s;ive, e&s;pecially in Etru&s;can va&s;es, lamps, and antiquities, of <HI>terra cotta.</HI> One of the mo&s;t remarkable lamps is moulded into the form of a camel, with an amphora on each &s;ide, fixed in a cradle. The water-carriers, at Palermo, u&s;e a &s;imilar contri|vance to this day, for conveying water upon a&s;&s;es. Among his bu&s;ts and &s;tatues, &s;ome are con&s;picuous for the perfection of their &s;culpture; others for the per|&s;ons they repre&s;ent. It would require a volume to de|&s;cribe them; let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that his collection con&s;i&s;ts of whatever Catania and Sicily produce, that is curious in antiquity.</P>
<P>Among other curio&s;ities, is the organ at the Bene|dictine convent, built by a Neapolitan prie&s;t. The tunes of all &s;orts of wind and &s;trung in&s;truments are imitated with the mo&s;t perfect illu&s;ion. One of the pipes gives an echo in &s;o aerial a manner, that you follow the &s;ound to its di&s;tant reverberations, till it lo&s;es it&s;elf in &s;pace.</P>
<P>Catania, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> is looked upon as one of the mo&s;t ancient cities in the world. Their legends aver, that it was founded by the Cyclops, or giants of Aetna, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fir&s;t inhabitants of Sicily, after the deluge; and, &s;ome Sicilian writers pretend, it was
<PB N="163" REF="165">
built by <HI>Deucalion</HI> and <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> as &s;oon as the waters &s;ub&s;ided, and had got down again to the foot of the mountain. Its ancient name was Cataetna, or the city of Aetna. It is now reckoned the third city in the kingdom; though, &s;ince Me&s;&s;ina has been de&s;troyed, it may well be con&s;idered as the &s;econd. It has a bi&s;hop; and the bi&s;hop's revenues, which are con&s;ide|rable, ari&s;e principally from the &s;ale of the &s;now on Mount Aetna; one &s;mall portion of which, lying in the north of the mountain, is &s;aid to bring him in up|wards of a thou&s;and pounds a year; for Aetna fur|ni&s;hes &s;now and ice, not only to the whole i&s;land of Sicily, but likewi&s;e to Malta, and a great part of Italy, and makes a very con&s;iderable branch of commerce; for, even the pea&s;ants in the&s;e hot countries, regalo them&s;elves with ices, during the &s;ummer heats; and, there is no entertainment, given by the nobility, of which the&s;e do not always make a principal part. A famine of &s;now, they &s;ay, would be more grievous, than a famine of either corn or wine. It is a com|mon ob&s;ervation among them, that without the &s;nows of Aetna, their i&s;land could not be inhabited; but, Aetna not only cools them in &s;ummer, but warms them in winter; the fuel for the greater part of the i&s;land, being carried from the immen&s;e and inexhau&s;|tible fore&s;ts of this volcano.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166">Near to the walls of the ancient city, many of which are &s;tanding, near &s;ixty feet high, and of great &s;trength, and yet the lava of 1669 overflowed them; near to the&s;e walls, and the Benedictine convent, they have di&s;covered the fragments of a famous tem|ple of <HI>Ceres,</HI> a nymphaeum, the gymna&s;ium, and a naumachia, that was near the ca&s;tle; the ve&s;tiges of which were to be &s;een, before the lava of 1669 had covered them; and two arches of the aqueducts, lead|ing to which, are &s;till vi&s;ible in the lava.</P>
<P>So many public edifices, crouded together in &s;o &s;mall a &s;pace, mu&s;t have left but little room for the hou&s;es of individuals, which may lead us to conclude, that this city has been embelli&s;hed, at different periods; or, that the private hou&s;es were extremely &s;mall, in compari&s;on to the public buildings; or, that ancient Catania was &s;till more ornamented than exten&s;ive; and, con&s;equently, more rich than popular. The modern town is of the &s;ame nature; for, though the Catanians e&s;timate their number at &s;ixty thou&s;and, we &s;ee nothing in the &s;treets but convents, churches, and palaces, &s;eparated by a few private hou&s;es.</P>
<P>It is difficult to a&s;&s;ign the epocha of this &s;plendor of Catania. The great quantity of Latin in&s;criptions, di&s;covered in the different edifices, the baths, the naumachia, &amp;c. known only to the Romans, lead us
<PB N="165" REF="167">
to determine its &s;plendor to have been in their time, which continued to the incur&s;ions of the Barbarians; who broke the &s;tatues, pillaged the bronzes, and melted down the metals to carry them off. Next came the Normans; who, barbarou&s;ly catholic, piou&s;ly de&s;poiled the beautiful temples of their marbles, to con&s;truct their mi&s;erable churches.</P>
<P>Catania, now a hand&s;ome city, but without an inn, is, mo&s;t likely, to be again de&s;troyed by commotion of the mountain. Catania is now purged and purified from all the infection contracted from heathen rites; and the rotundo, like the pantheon at Rome, which &s;eems to have out-lived other buildings, owing to its &s;ingular form, is become a Chri&s;tian church. It is not a little curious to con&s;ider, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> how &s;mall the deviation is, in the pre&s;ent rites, from tho&s;e of the ancients, in almo&s;t every article. It is a ju&s;t ob&s;ervation; that, during the long reign of heathen|i&s;m, &s;uper&s;tition had exhau&s;ted her talent for inven|tion; &s;o that, when a &s;uper&s;titious &s;pirit &s;eized Chri&s;|tians, they were under a nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing from their predece&s;&s;ors, and imitating &s;ome part of their ido|latry. In &s;ome places, the very images &s;till remain. They have only chri&s;tened them; and, the &s;tatue that bore the name of <HI>Venus,</HI> or <HI>Pro&s;erpine,</HI> is now called <HI>Mary Magdalene,</HI> or the Virgin. The &s;ame ceremonies are daily performed before the&s;e images, in the &s;ame
<PB N="166" REF="168">
language, and nearly in the &s;ame manner. The &s;aints are perpetually coming down in per&s;on, and working miracles, as did the heathen gods of old. The walls of the temples are covered with the vows of pilgrims, as they were formerly. The holy-water, which was held in &s;uch dete&s;tation by the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, is again revered and &s;prinkled about with the &s;ame devotion, as in the time of Pagani&s;m. The &s;ame ince&s;t is burnt by prie&s;ts, arrayed in the &s;ame manner, with the &s;ame grimaces, genuflexions, before the &s;ame images, and in the &s;ame temples too. In &s;hort, &s;o nearly do the rites coincide, that, were the pagan high-prie&s;t to re|turn and re-a&s;&s;ume his functions, he would only have to learn a few new names; to get the ma&s;s, the paters, and the eves by heart. <HI>Brydone</HI> &s;ays, he took notice of this to a Roman Catholic nobleman, who is not the mo&s;t zealous &s;ectary in the world, and he frankly owned the truth of the ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Not far from Catania, between that and Me&s;&s;ina, is the city of Iaci; near which <HI>Homer</HI> has placed the landing of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and which &s;till bears the name of <HI>Porto d'Uly&s;&s;e. Homer</HI> mu&s;t have made a very bad choice, for a place to land his hero, or el&s;e the lava has greatly changed its form. The &s;hoals, or rocks, between this and Catania, which are a hundred feet above the level of the &s;ea; and, probably, as many below it, are entire ma&s;&s;es of lava. It is impo&s;&s;ible to
<PB N="167" REF="169">
conceive, how the&s;e ma&s;&s;es have become in&s;ulated, with gulphs between them, of &s;uch profundity, as to make the water black as ink; unle&s;s &s;ome dreadful convul&s;ions of the North have removed the &s;andy bot|tom, on which the&s;e ma&s;&s;es had run, when liquid; and have thus &s;eparated them from the &s;hore, and formed them into rocks.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of Syracu&s;e, and the chief Antiquities of the I&s;land.</HEAD>
<P>THE great and mighty Syracu&s;e, who&s;e &s;pacious harbour once received innumerable fleets; who&s;e battles were fought by the Athenians, within its circumference; and, where the triumphant Carthagi|nians found their tombs, is now a de&s;olate, and a filthy wretched place; but, the i&s;le of Ortyra, which is the modern town, and was anciently the fortre&s;s and ca&s;tle of <HI>Diony&s;ius,</HI> has been fortified by the King of Spain, though without artillery. Tho&s;e who come here, by
<PB N="168" REF="170">
&s;ea, are obliged to perform quarantine, at the in|&s;tance of tho&s;e who farm out the lazarettos of Sicily, and oblige all ve&s;&s;els to quarantine, though there is not a &s;hed, nor even ground enough for the prows, of the little craft that come here, to re&s;t upon. This difficulty they oblige mariners to put up with, for twenty-eight days, in order to fill the pockets of tho&s;e who guard the ve&s;&s;el, by little indulgencies they &s;hew them.</P>
<P>The fountain of <HI>Arethu&s;a</HI> is one of the chief cu|rio&s;ities, and pieces of antiquity here. It is an angular ba&s;on, of &s;ulphureous water, clo&s;e to the &s;ea, formed by two wells, but not antique wells, and where now the dirtie&s;t linen is wa&s;hed, by a number of &s;till dirtier women; who, almo&s;t naked, and with their petticoats tucked up, pre&s;ent the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting &s;cene immode&s;ty can di&s;play. Notwith&s;tanding the wretched condition of this fountain, it appears miraculous, that, from the centre of a rock, almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, a &s;pring &s;hould break out in &s;treams; which, when united, mu&s;t rather have re&s;embled the mouth of a river, than a fountain. Near this fountain, was the palace of <HI>Verres,</HI> and that delicious walk which <HI>Cicero</HI> accu&s;es the procon&s;ul of converting into a &s;cene of debauchery. It is &s;till the public walk, but has now no delights; being nothing but a narrow &s;auntering place, between a great wall; and the parapet of the
<PB N="169" REF="171">
harbour planted with a few &s;orry birches. At the bottom of the wall are two fragments, of a Norman building, which might have been part of the palace of <HI>Verres.</HI></P>
<P>Of the temples of <HI>Diana</HI> and <HI>Minerva,</HI> the palace of <HI>Dyoni&s;ius,</HI> his garden, his tomb, and tho&s;e famous baths, of the celebrated <HI>Daphnis,</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Mercury,</HI> and a nymph, the inventor of pa&s;toral poetry, who charmed <HI>Diana</HI> by his &s;ongs and ver&s;es, and was puni&s;h|ed with blindne&s;s for his infidelity, nothing remains but the temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI> converted into a cathedral; and part of the temple of <HI>Diana,</HI> now in the chamber of a private individual, being two pieces of columns, fixed up to &s;upport a roof, and enlarge bis apart|ment.</P>
<P>In Acradina, originally part of Syracu&s;e, &s;tands the church of St. <HI>John,</HI> in &s;ome low grounds, covering the entrance of immen&s;e catacombs, where the an|cient Sicilians buried their dead; the primitive &s;aith|ful are &s;uppo&s;ed to have a&s;&s;embled here, in times of per&s;ecution; and to have interred their brethren in the&s;e vaults. The&s;e vaults are formed in &s;treets, cut through one continued &s;tratum of &s;oft &s;tone, a &s;edi|ment of marine bodies; cro&s;&s;ing each other in many directions, and are hewn with more care and regula|rity, than the catacombs of St. <HI>Januarius,</HI> at Naples.

At &s;tated di&s;tances, there are large circular rooms, lined with &s;tucco, and pierced at the top, &s;o as to ad|mit light and air. On each &s;ide of the walls, are re|ce&s;&s;es cut into the rock; and, in the floor of the&s;e ca|vities, coffins of all &s;izes have been hollowed out. In &s;ome places, there have been twenty troughs, one be|hind another; and &s;keletons have been found in them, with a piece of money in their mouths.</P>
<P>Near the port, they &s;hew the &s;pot where &s;tood <HI>Ar|chimedes</HI>'s hou&s;e; and al&s;o the tower, from whence he is &s;aid to have &s;et fire to the Roman galleys, with his burning gla&s;&s;es.

He fixed four hundred &s;mall mir|rors in a kind of frame, and di&s;po&s;ed them in &s;uch a manner, that the rays, reflected from each of them, fell exactly on the &s;ame point; by which means he melted lead, at the di&s;tance of a hundred and twenty feet, and &s;et fire to a hay-&s;tack, at a much greater di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The end of this philo&s;opher was remarkable. When <HI>Marcellus,</HI> the Roman general, was before the

On his arrival at his hou&s;e, he told the philo&s;o|pher his me&s;&s;age; but, he being too taken up with &s;tudies, paid little attention to the &s;ummons; which &s;o exa&s;perated the &s;oldier, that, to revenge his di&s;obedi|ence to the general, he immediately ran him through the body, and killed him.</P>
<P>The chief remains of antiquity, be&s;ides tho&s;e I have mentioned, are a theatre, and amphitheatre; many &s;epulchres, the latomic, and the ear of <HI>Diony&s;ius.</HI> The latomie now makes a noble &s;ubterraneous garden; and is, indeed, a romantic and beautiful &s;pot. Mo&s;t of it is about a hundred feet below the level of the earth, and of an incredible extent. The whole is hewn out of a rock, compo&s;ed of a concretion of &s;hells, gravel, and other marine bodies. The bottom of this immen&s;e quarry, from whence, probably, the greate&s;t part of Syracu&s;e was built, is now covered with an exceeding rich &s;oil; and, as no wind from any part of the compa&s;s can touch it, it is filled with a great variety of the fine&s;t &s;hrubs and fruit-trees, which bear, with va&s;t luxuriance, and are never bla&s;ted. The oranges, citrons, bergamots, pomegranates, figs, &amp;c. are all of a remarkable &s;ize, and fine quality. Some of the&s;e trees, but more particularly the olives,
<PB N="172" REF="175">
grow out of the hard rock, where there is no vi&s;ible &s;oil, and exhibit a very uncommon and plea&s;ing ap|pearance. This is the &s;ame &s;pot, &s;o celebrated by <HI>Cicero,</HI> about eighteen hundred years ago. <HI>Opus e&s;t ingens,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>magnificum regum ac tyrannorum.

<P>The ear of <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> is no le&s;s a monument, of in|genuity and magnificence, than of the cruelty of that tyrant. It is a huge cavern, cut out of the hard rock, in form of a human ear; the perpendicular height, about eighty feet; and its length, no le&s;s than two hundred and fifty. This cavern was &s;aid to be &s;o con|trived, that every &s;ound made in it was collected, and united into one focus, which was called the <HI>tympanum;</HI> and, exactly oppo&s;ite to it, the tyrant had made a &s;mall hole, which communicated with a little apart|ment, where he u&s;ed to conceal him&s;elf. He applied his own ear at this hole, and is &s;aid to have heard di&s;|tinctly, every word that was &s;poken in the cavern below. This apartment was no &s;ooner fini&s;hed, than he put to death all the workmen that had been em|ployed in it. He then confined all that he &s;u&s;pected were his enemies; and, by over-hearing their conver|&s;ation, judged of their guilt; and condemned, or ac|quitted them, accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="176">The amphitheatre is in the form of a very eccen|tric ellip&s;e, and much fallen to decay; but the theatre is &s;o entire, that mo&s;t of the &s;eats &s;till remain. There are near twenty remains of temples, but none that are di&s;tingui&s;hable; a few fine columns of <HI>Jupiter Olympus</HI> &s;till remain; and the temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI> now converted, as I have ob&s;erved, into the cathedral, is almo&s;t entire.</P>
<P>Syracu&s;e was compo&s;ed of four cities; Ortygia is the only one remaining, by much the &s;malle&s;t, &s;ituated in the i&s;land of that name; is about two miles round, and contains about fourteen thou&s;and people. The ruins of the other three, Tycha, Acradina, and Nea|poli, are computed at twenty-two miles in circum|ference; almo&s;t the whole &s;pace of which is now converted into rich vineyards, orchards, and corn|fields. The walls of the&s;e are, indeed, built with broken marbles, full of engravings and in&s;criptions, but mo&s;t of them defaced and &s;poiled.</P>
<P>On a hill, near Ortygia, is a convent of capuchin friars. When a &s;tranger walks up to this mona&s;tery, he &s;ees neither verdure nor tree, all appears one dreary rock; and, little does he &s;u&s;pect he is within reach of exten&s;ive orchards, which, by their produce, yield a hand&s;ome income to the friars. No &s;ight can be more &s;ingular than the gardens of this convent,
<PB N="174" REF="177">
which are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;ubterraneous; being contained in the areas of immen&s;e excavations, made by cutting &s;tone for the ancient city. The&s;e areas are covered with a thick grove of trees, loaded with rich &s;cented blo&s;&s;oms, and beautiful fruit. The vaults, of this convent, have the property of drying the bodies of the dead, in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time; after which, they are dre&s;&s;ed in religious habits, and placed as &s;ta|tues in niches, on each &s;ide of the &s;ubterranean alleys.</P>
<P>The dioce&s;e of Syracu&s;e produces above forty dif|ferent &s;orts of wine; the honey of the hills is as clear as amber, and of delicious flavour; and vegetables are admirable in their kind, particularly brocoli, which grows to a very great &s;ize. Syracu&s;e is the milde&s;t climate that can be for a winter's re&s;idence; two or three days of &s;harp Ea&s;terly winds excepted; the remainder of the winter months is a continual &s;pring. On the 16th of January, the vines which are kept low, and clo&s;ed pruned, had &s;hot out new leaves; the gardens were &s;haded with flowers, and fre&s;h al|monds were gathered from the trees. The river, at Ortygia, throws up great quantities of fine amber. Sugar-canes, ready jointed for chewing, are &s;old in the market, and &s;alt may be had gratis.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="178">Agrigentum, now Girgenti, was the &s;econd ancient city, in &s;ize, to Syracu&s;e; it is &s;ituated on the Ea&s;t coa&s;t of Sicily, on the top of a mountain, eleven hun|dred feet above the level of the &s;ea, and about four miles di&s;tant from the port of Agrigentum; from which place the road, on each &s;ide, is bordered by a row of exceeding large American aloes. When <HI>Brydone</HI> was there, upwards of one-third of them were in full bloom, and making the mo&s;t beautiful appearance. The flower &s;tems, of this noble plant, are, in general, between twenty and thirty feet high (&s;ome more) and are covered with flowers from top to bottom, which taper regularly, and form a beautiful kind of pyramid; the ba&s;e, or pede&s;tal of which, is the fine &s;preading leaves of that plant. With us, they are reckoned only to flower once in a hundred years; but in Sicily they blow always at the late&s;t, the &s;ixth year; and often the fifth. The whole &s;ub&s;tance of the plant being carried into the &s;tem and the flowers, the leaves begin to decay, as &s;oon as the bloom is completed, and a numerous offspring of young plants are produced round the root of the old one; the&s;e are &s;lipped off, and formed into new plantations; either for hedges, or for avenues to their country hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The city of Girgenti is irregular and ugly, but it looks grand at a di&s;tance; lying on the &s;lope of the
<PB N="176" REF="179">
mountain. The hou&s;es are mean, the &s;treets dirty, crooked and narrow, yet it contains near twenty thou&s;and people; a &s;ad reduction from its ancient grandeur, when it was &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of no le&s;s than eight hundred thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The antiquities of this place are, perhaps, more con&s;iderable than any in Sicily. The ruins, of the ancient city, lie about eight miles from the modern one. The&s;e, like tho&s;e of the Syracu&s;e, are mo&s;tly converted into corn-fields, vineyards, and orchards; but the remains of the temples, here, are more con|&s;picuous. Four of the&s;e temples &s;tood pretty much in a right line. Half of the fir&s;t remains; the &s;econd has every column &s;tanding; con&s;i&s;ting of thirteen fluted Doric pillars, with all their ba&s;es, capitals, entablatures, &amp;c. complete. The third temple is that of <HI>Hercules,</HI> and contained that famous &s;tatue &s;o much celebrated by <HI>Cicero.</HI> Near to this lie ruins of the temple of <HI>Jupiter Olympus,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the large&s;t in the heathen world. It is now called the giant's temple, but is a perfect ruin. It was exactly, we are told, of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions with the church of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> at Rome; but this we apprehend not to be true: the temple of <HI>E&s;culapius</HI> (the ruins of which are &s;till to be &s;een) are not le&s;s celebrated for a &s;tatue of <HI>Apollo,</HI> which was taken from this temple
<PB N="177" REF="180">
by the Carthaginians, and continued the greate&s;t or|nament of Carthage for many years; and was, at la&s;t, re&s;tored by <HI>Scipio,</HI> at the final de&s;truction of that city. Some Sicilians alledge, that it was afterwards carried to Rome, and is the <HI>Apollo</HI> of Belvidere.</P>
<P>The ancient walls are mo&s;tly cut out of the rock; the catacombs and &s;epulchres are all very great; and the monument of <HI>Tero,</HI> king of Agrigentum, one of the fir&s;t of the Sicilian tyrants, who&s;e name is men|tioned by <HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Pindar,</HI> mu&s;t be more than two thou&s;and years old.</P>
<P>All the&s;e mighty ruins, and the whole mountain on which it &s;tands, are compo&s;ed of a concretion of &s;ea-&s;hells, and cemented by a kind of &s;and, or gravel, and now become as hard, and, perhaps, more durable than marble; a proof, that this globe mu&s;t have under-gone many convul&s;ions, not recorded in any hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The magnificence, the pomp, the ho&s;pitality of the ancient inhabitants of Agrigentum, may be read in <HI>Diodorus Siculus, Pliny, Solinus, Virgil, Timeus,</HI> and others. In the great church, at Agrigentum, there is a remarkable echo; &s;omething in the manner of our whi&s;pering gallery at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, though more difficult to be accounted for. If one per&s;on &s;tands at the We&s;t gate, and another places him&s;elf on the cornice,
<PB N="178" REF="181">
at the mo&s;t di&s;tant point of the church, exactly behind the great altar, they can hold a conver&s;ation in very low whi&s;pers. For many years this &s;ingularity was not known; and, &s;everal of the confe&s;&s;ing chairs being placed near the great altar, the wags, who were in the &s;ecret, u&s;ed to take their &s;tation at the door of the ca|thedral; and thus heard, di&s;tinctly, every word that pa&s;&s;ed between the confe&s;&s;or and his penitent; of which they did not fail to make their own u&s;e, when occa&s;ion offered. The mo&s;t &s;ecret intrigues were di&s;|covered; and &s;uch ladies as were di&s;po&s;ed to intrigue, were very well known. This lead every woman in Agrigentum to change, either her gallant, or her con|fe&s;&s;or. Yet, &s;till it was the &s;ame.&mdash;At la&s;t, however, the cau&s;e was found out; the chairs were removed, and other precautions taken, to prevent the future di&s;|covery of &s;uch &s;acred my&s;teries.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the Manners of the Sicilians, their Amu&s;ements, and Travelling.</HEAD>
<P>THE Sicilians, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> are much more ani|mated in conver&s;ation, than either the French or Neapolitans; and their action is generally &s;o ju&s;t, and &s;o expre&s;&s;ive of their &s;entiments, that without hearing what is &s;aid, one may comprehend the &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e. The origin of this cu&s;tom they carry &s;o far back, as the time of the earlie&s;t tyrants of Syracu&s;e; who, to prevent con&s;piracies, had forbidden their &s;ubjects, under heavy penalties, to be &s;een talking together in parties. This induced them to invent a method of communicating their ideas by action, which they pretend has been tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>The people of Sicily, till lately, retained a great many ridiculous and &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;toms, particu|larly in their marriage and funeral ceremonies; &s;ome
<PB N="180" REF="183">
of them are &s;till retained in the wild and mountainous part of the i&s;land. As &s;oon as the marriage ceremony is performed, two of the attendants are ready to cram a &s;poonful of honey into the mouths of the bride and bridegroom, as emblematical of their love and union, which they hope will continue as &s;weet to their &s;ouls, as is honey to their palates; they then begin to throw handfuls of wheat upon them, which is continued all the way to the hou&s;e of the bridegroom; probably, &s;ome remains of an ancient rite to <HI>Ceres.</HI> They fancy it procures them a numerous progeny; but, without this, they are abundantly prolific. Women frequently, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> having upwards of forty children. <HI>Car|rera</HI> mentions one who had forty-&s;even. The young couple are not allowed to partake of the marriage-fea&s;t; and this to teach them temperance, and pa|tience; but, when dinner is fini&s;hed, a great bone is pre&s;ented to the bridegroom, by the bride's father, or one of her neare&s;t relations, who pronounces the&s;e words, "<HI>Rodi tu que&s;t' o&s;&s;o,</HI> &amp;c." "Pick you this bone, for you have now taken in hand to pick one, which you will find much harder, and of more difficult di|ge&s;tion." Hence, probably, the old &s;aying, "I'll give him a bone to pick."</P>
<P>Like mo&s;t other nations in Europe, they carefully avoid marrying in the month of May, as inau&s;picious; a piece of &s;uper&s;tition, perhaps, older than the time
<PB N="181" REF="184">
of the Romans. But the marriages, of the Sicilian nobility, are celebrated with great magnificence. The ladies marry very young, and often live to &s;ee the fifth or &s;ixth generation. They are generally &s;prightly and agreeable, &s;ays <HI>Brydone;</HI> but what the Engli&s;h would call ordinary. They have remarkable fine hair, know how to adorn it to the greate&s;t advantage, and pride them&s;elves on their female ance&s;tors', in a dearth of bow-&s;trings, when Palermo was be&s;ieged, cutting off their hair, and twi&s;ting it into &s;trings, for de&s;truction to their enemies; which heroi&s;m &s;aved the town till a&s;&s;i&s;tance was procured. Their hair, now, di&s;charges no other &s;hafts than tho&s;e of <HI>Cupid;</HI> and the only cords it forms, are the cords of love.</P>
<P>The Sicilians are much fonder of &s;tudy, than their neighbours on the continent, and their education much more attended to; &s;o oppo&s;ite are they to the Italian nobility in general, who have nothing but &s;mall-talk; the Sicilian nobility talk on &s;ubjects of literature, hi&s;tory, and politics, but chiefly of poetry; this is a univer&s;al topic. Every one, in &s;ome period of his life, is &s;ure to be in&s;pired; and a lover is never be|lieved, whil&s;t he &s;peaks in pro&s;e; but is reckoned true, in proportion as he is poetical.</P>
<P>Many of the young nobility &s;peak Engli&s;h, and are well acquainted with our poets and philo&s;ophers; our
<PB N="182" REF="185">
language is a part of their polite education, and they pride them&s;elves in a&s;&s;ociating with the well-bred Eng|li&s;h; but do not &s;eem plea&s;ed with their neighbours of the continent.</P>
<P>The native language of Sicily is now a mixture, of Norman, Roman, German, Italian, Spani&s;h, and &s;ome remnants of the old tongue; the i&s;land having been over-run, at times, by the&s;e nations. I &s;earched among their literature, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> and met with no good pro&s;e-compo&s;ition; and &s;carcely a poet of moderate genius is to be di&s;covered among ver&s;ifiers that have rhymed their native dialect.</P>
<P>The luxury of the people here, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> like that of the Neapolitans, con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in their equi|pages and hor&s;es; but, by a wi&s;e law of the King of Sardinia, &s;till in force, the viceroy alone is allowed to drive in Palermo with &s;ix hor&s;es; the praeter, the archbi&s;hop, the pre&s;ident of the parliament, with four; all the re&s;t of the nobility are re&s;tricted to two, but drive four out of the city. Every family of di&s;tinction has, at lea&s;t, two or three carriages in daily u&s;e; the wife of a man of fa&s;hion has always one at her com|mand; and the upper &s;ervants of the fir&s;t families have one al&s;o for <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="186">Prince is a common title here; the elde&s;t &s;ons take the title of marquis, or count, and the younger &s;ons are called <HI>dons;</HI> the daughters <HI>donnas,</HI> before their chri&s;tian names; as we call the daughters, and younger &s;ons of dukes, lady and lord.</P>
<P>They make very &s;plendid entertainments; and it is a cu&s;tom, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> at &s;uch entertainments at Girgenti, (he is not &s;ure it was the &s;ame at Palermo) that none of the family will ta&s;te a mor&s;el till the &s;tran|gers have helped them&s;elves; they are then to help the per&s;ons of the family they dine with. This cu&s;tom, he apprehends, was founded on an idea, of having given every thing to the gue&s;t, and then receiving at his hands what he could &s;pare.</P>
<P>Some of their amu&s;ements we have de&s;cribed. They have a very good opera at Palermo; and <HI>Brydone</HI> &s;ays, he was pre&s;ent at a ballet, which con&s;i&s;ted of a repre&s;entation of Vauxhall Gardens, in London; in which all the outr&egrave; characters of the Engli&s;h, in dre&s;s, and manner, caricatured, from the upper to the lower cla&s;s of people, are exhibited, and with no &s;mall de|gree of humour. Three quakers were introduced, as duped by three ladies of the town, in concert with three jack-tars, their lovers.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="187">The Sicilians are pa&s;&s;ionately fond of loud wind and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic; and, upon great holidays, will collect before a church-door, forty or fifty drums, all beating together; for the greater the noi&s;e, the more honour for the &s;aint.</P>
<P>The account of travelling in Sicily, where there are no po&s;t-roads, no public-carriages, or any inns, we will give our readers from <HI>Brydone;</HI> who cro&s;&s;ed the i&s;land in two or three places. Being well recom|mended, he had the favour of tho&s;e who could accom|modate him with mules, guards, &amp;c.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Brydone</HI> propo&s;ed &s;etting off from Me&s;|&s;ina, towards Catania, the prince of <HI>Villa Franca</HI> told him, he would give orders for guards to attend him, who &s;hould be an&s;werable for every thing; that what|ever number of mules he had occa&s;ion for, &s;hould be at the door of the inn, at any hour he &s;hould appoint; that the guards he &s;hould &s;end, were men of the mo&s;t determined re&s;olution, as well as the mo&s;t approved fidelity; and would not fail to cha&s;ti&s;e, on the &s;pot, any per&s;on who &s;hould pre&s;ume to impo&s;e on him.</P>
<P>The&s;e guards, Mr. <HI>Brydone</HI> di&s;covered afterwards, to be &s;ome of the mo&s;t daring, and hardened villains, perhaps, that are to be met with upon earth; who, in any other country, would have been broken on the
<PB N="185" REF="188">
wheel, or hung in chains; but are here publicly pro|tected. The prince's &s;ecretary told him, that in the Ea&s;t part of the i&s;land, called <HI>Val Demoni</HI> (from the devils that are &s;uppo&s;ed to inhabit Mount Aetna) it has ever been found impracticable to extirpate the ban|ditti; there being numberle&s;s caverns, and &s;ubter|raneous pa&s;&s;ages, in that mountain, where no troops could po&s;&s;ibly pur&s;ue them; that, be&s;ides, as they are known to take a dreadful revenge on all who have of|fended them, the prince of <HI>Villa Franca</HI> has embraced it, not only as the &s;afe&s;t, but as the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t po|litical &s;cheme, to become their declared patron and protector; and &s;uch of them as think proper to leave their rece&s;&s;es, though only for a time, are &s;ure to meet with good encouragement and &s;ecurity in his &s;ervice. They enjoy the mo&s;t unbounded confidence; which, in no in&s;tance, they have ever yet been found to make an improper, or a di&s;hone&s;t u&s;e of. They are cloathed in the prince's livery, yellow and green, with &s;ilver|lace; and wear likewi&s;e a badge of their honourable order, which entitles them to univer&s;al fear and re|&s;pect from the people.</P>
<P>In &s;ome circum&s;tances, the&s;e banditti are the mo&s;t re&s;pectable people in the i&s;land; and have, by much, the highe&s;t and mo&s;t romantic notions of what they call their point of honour; that, however criminal they may be with regard to &s;ociety in general; yet,
<PB N="186" REF="189">
with re&s;pect to one another, and to every per&s;on, to whom they have once profe&s;&s;ed it, they have ever main|tained the mo&s;t un&s;haken fidelity. The magi&s;trates have often been obliged to protect them, and even pay them court, being known to be perfectly determined and de&s;perate; and &s;o extremely vindictive, that they will put any per&s;on to death, who has ever given them ju&s;t cau&s;e of provocation. On the other hand, <HI>Bry|done</HI> was well-informed, that it never was known, that any per&s;on who had put him&s;elf under their protection, and &s;hewed that he had confidence in them, had cau&s;e to repent it, or was injured by them, in the mo&s;t minute trifle; but, on the contrary, they will protect him from impo&s;itions of every kind, and &s;corn to go halves with the landlord, like mo&s;t other conductors and travelling &s;ervants; and will defend them with their lives, if there is occa&s;ion. But tho&s;e, of their num|ber, who have enli&s;ted them&s;elves in the &s;ervice of &s;o|ciety, are known and re&s;pected by the other banditti all over the i&s;land; and the per&s;ons of tho&s;e they ac|company, are ever held &s;acred. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, mo&s;t travellers chu&s;e to hire a couple of them, from town to town, and may then travel over the i&s;land in &s;afety. Two recent &s;tories will &s;erve to illu&s;trate their character.</P>
<P>A number of people were found digging in a place, where &s;ome trea&s;ure was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been con|cealed,
<PB N="187" REF="190">
during the plague; this being forbidden under &s;evere penalties, they were immediately taken to pri&s;on, and expected to have been treated without mercy; but, luckily for the re&s;t, one of the&s;e ban|ditti happened to be of the number. He wrote to the prince of <HI>Villa Franca,</HI> and made u&s;e of &s;uch powerful arguments in their favour, they were all im|mediately &s;et at liberty. This &s;erves to &s;hew their con&s;equence with the civil power. The other &s;tory will give our readers a &s;trong idea of their barbarous ferocity, and the horrid mixture of &s;tubborn vice, and virtue, (if it may be called by that name) that &s;eems to direct their actions. They have a practice of bor|rowing money from the country-people, who dare never refu&s;e them; and, if they promi&s;e to pay it, they have ever been found punctual and exact, both as to the time and &s;um; and would rather rob and mur|der an innocent per&s;on, than fail of payment at the day appointed; and this they have been often obliged to do, in order (as they &s;ay) to fulfil their engage|ments, and &s;ave their honour.</P>
<P>It happened, at the time Mr. <HI>Brydone</HI> was at Me&s;|&s;ina, that the brother of one of the&s;e fellows having occa&s;ion for money, and not knowing how to procure it, determined to make u&s;e of his brother's name and authority; an artifice, which he thought would not ea&s;ily be di&s;covered. He, accordingly, went to a
<PB N="188" REF="191">
country prie&s;t, and told him, his brother had occa&s;ion for twenty ducats, which he de&s;ired he would imme|diately lend him. The prie&s;t a&s;&s;ured him, he had not then &s;o large a &s;um; but that, if he would return in a few days, it &s;hould be ready for him. The other replied, that he was afraid to return to his brother with that an&s;wer; and de&s;ired that he would, by all means, take care to keep out of his way, at lea&s;t, till &s;uch time as he had pacified him; otherwi&s;e, he could not be an&s;werable for the con&s;equences. As bad for|tune would have it, the prie&s;t and the robber met in a narrow road. The former trembled, as the latter approached; and, at la&s;t, dropped on his knees to beg for mercy. The robber, a&s;toni&s;hed at his beha|viour, de&s;ired to know the cau&s;e of it. The trembling prie&s;t an&s;wered, <HI>"Il denaro, il denaro,"</HI> "The money, the money"&mdash;but &s;end your brother to-morrow and you &s;hall have it. The haughty robber a&s;&s;ured him, that he di&s;dained taking money of a poor prie&s;t; adding, that if any of his brothers had been low enough to make &s;uch a demand, he him&s;elf was ready to ad|vance the &s;um. The prie&s;t then acquainted him with the vi&s;it he had received the preceding night, from his brother, by his order; a&s;&s;uring him, that had he been ma&s;ter of the &s;um, he &s;hould immediately have lent it. Well, &s;aid the robber, I will now convince you, whether my brother or I are mo&s;t to be believed; you &s;hall go with me to his hou&s;e, which is but a few
<PB N="189" REF="192">
miles off. On their arrival at the door, the robber called on his brother; who, never &s;u&s;pecting the di&s;|covery, came immediately to the balcony; but, on perceiving the prie&s;t, began to make excu&s;es for his conduct. The robber told him, there was no excu&s;e to be made, that he only de&s;ired to know the fact, whether he had gone to borrow money of that prie&s;t, in his name? On his &s;aying he had, the robber with deliberate coolne&s;s, rai&s;ed his blunderbu&s;s to his &s;houlder, and &s;hot him dead; and, turning to the a&s;to|ni&s;hed prie&s;t, "You will now be per&s;uaded," &s;aid he, "that I have no intention of robbing <HI>you</HI> at lea&s;t."</P>
<P>This hero might have been one of the guards, ap|pointed to conduct Mr. <HI>Brydone</HI> and his company on the road; for, the prince's &s;ecretary told him, that if any per&s;on &s;hould pre&s;ume to impo&s;e upon him, to the value of a &s;ingle <HI>baioc</HI> (which is a very &s;mall coin) he would certainly put him to death. He gave the &s;e|cretary an ounce, about eleven &s;hillings, on which he thanked his excellency, for &s;o he called him; and de|clared, bowing, he was the mo&s;t <HI>honorabilis &s;ignor,</HI> he had ever met with; and that, if he plea&s;ed, he him|&s;elf would have the honour of attending him, and would cha&s;ti&s;e any per&s;on who &s;hould pre&s;ume to take the wall of him, or affront him in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="193">The guards &s;ent with Mr. <HI>Brydone,</HI> were two of the mo&s;t re&s;olute, and de&s;perate of this gang; two great drawcan&s;ir figures, armed <HI>cap-a-pie,</HI> with a broad han|ger each, two enormous pi&s;tols, and a long arque|bu&s;e, kept cocked and ready for action, in all &s;u&s;pi|cious places; where they recounted wonderful &s;tories of robberies and murders, in which they had been the principal actors. They took great pains that the tra|vellers, under their e&s;cort, &s;hould not pay too much, taxing the bills as they thought proper. So, one day's dinner, for eleven men, and feeding ten mules and hor&s;es, did not amount to half-a-guinea; and, though the&s;e guards are paid one ounce each, per day; they &s;ave, at lea&s;t, one-half of it in the bills. They entertained their company with &s;ome of their feats, and made no &s;cruple of owning, that they had put &s;everal people to death; but added, <HI>Mas tutti, tutti honorabilment&eacute;.</HI> That is to &s;ay, they did not do it in a da&s;tardly manner, nor without ju&s;t provocation. There po&s;&s;ibly may be truth in their &s;tories; a num|ber of gibbets being erected on the road <HI>in terrorem;</HI> and every little baron has the power of life and death in his own domain. Four-and-twenty of the&s;e de&s;|perate banditti, were lately &s;eized, after a &s;trong re|&s;i&s;tance, wherein &s;everal were killed on both &s;ides; and, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome were under the protection of the nobility, and in their &s;ervice, they were all hanged.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP X.</HI> On their Government, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE feudal &s;y&s;tem was fir&s;t introduced here, by count <HI>Rugiero,</HI> about the middle of the eleventh century; immediately after he had driven the Sara|cens out of the i&s;land, and has continued ever &s;ince. He divided Sicily into three parts; the fir&s;t, by con|&s;ent of his army, was given to the church; the &s;econd he be&s;towed on his officers; and the third he re&s;erved for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e three branches, or as they call them, <HI>braccios</HI> (arms) he compo&s;ed his parliament; and the form &s;till remains. The <HI>braccio militare</HI> is compo&s;ed of all the barons of the kingdom, to the number of two hundred and fifty-one, who are &s;till obliged to military &s;ervice. Their chief is the prince of <HI>Butero,</HI> who is hereditary pre&s;ident of the parliament; for, in conformity to the feudal government, &s;ome of the great officers are &s;till hereditary. The three archbi&s;hops, all the bi&s;hops,
<PB N="192" REF="195">
abb&eacute;'s, priors, and dignified clergy, amounting to near &s;eventy, form the <HI>braccio eccle&s;ia&s;tice.</HI> The archbi&s;hop of Palermo is their chief. The <HI>braccio demaniale</HI> is formed by election, like our Hou&s;e of Commons. There are forty-three royal cities, &s;tiled <HI>Demaniale,</HI> that have a right to elect members. Every hou&s;e-holder has a vote at this election. Their chief is the member for Palermo, who is al&s;o <HI>praeter,</HI> or mayor of the city. He is an officer of the highe&s;t rank, and his power is very exten&s;ive; inferior only to the viceroy, in who&s;e ab&s;ence the greate&s;t part of the authority de|volves on him. He has a company of grenadiers for his body-guard, and receives the title of Excellency.</P>
<P>The praeter, with &s;ix &s;enators, who are &s;tyled patri|cians, have the management of the civil government of the city. He is appointed every year by the King, or by the viceroy, which is the &s;ame thing; for the people do not even think of acting; &s;o that the very &s;hadow of liberty has now di&s;appeared, as well as the &s;ub&s;tance. In &s;hort, all courts, both civil and criminal, are appointed by royal authority; and all offices de|pend entirely on the caprice of the &s;overeign; but they have no inqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>The laws of Sicily are &s;cattered through a number of volumes; the&s;e, the King of Sardinia intended to abridge, and collect into one code; but, unfortu|nately,
<PB N="193" REF="196">
was not long enough in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land, to accompli&s;h this u&s;eful work; but, where there is an authority above law, law can be of little u&s;e.</P>
<P>The power of the viceroy is very ab&s;olute; he has not only the command of all the military force in the kingdom, but likewi&s;e pre&s;ides with unbounded autho|rity in all civil tribunals; and, being al&s;o inve&s;ted with the legantine power, his &s;way is equally great in matters of religion. He has the right of nominating to all the great offices in the kingdom, and confirm|ing of all dignities, both civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical.</P>
<P>In vi&s;iting the pri&s;ons, a ceremony which he per|forms with great pomp, twice a year; he has the power of liberating whatever pri&s;oners he plea&s;es; of reducing, or altering their &s;entences; their crimes and accu&s;ations having been fir&s;t read over to him. And, that there may be &s;ome appearance of a regard to law and ju&s;tice, his coun&s;ellor always attends him, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, to point out the limits of the law.</P>
<P>The whole military force of Sicily, amounts, at pre&s;ent, to nine thou&s;and five hundred men; about twelve hundred of which are cavalry. Many of their cities and fortre&s;&s;es would require a very numerous garri&s;on to defend them; particularly Me&s;&s;ina, Syra|cu&s;e, or Palermo: but, indeed, the &s;tate of their for|tifications
<PB N="194" REF="197">
is &s;uch, as well as that of their artillery, that were they inclined, they could but make a &s;mall defence.</P>
<P>If this i&s;land had a good navy, or was in the hands of a good naval power, it mu&s;t command the whole trade of the Levant. There are &s;everal little ports at each end of it; be&s;ides the great ones of Trapani, Syracu&s;e, and Me&s;&s;ina, which lie pretty near the three angles of the triangle. Whatever &s;hips had pa&s;&s;ed either of the&s;e, the others would be apprized of, in the &s;pace of half an hour, by means of &s;ignal towers, which are erected all round the i&s;land, to warn them again&s;t &s;udden inva&s;ions from the Barbary coa&s;t. The&s;e towers are built on every little promontory, within &s;ight of each other. Fires are always kept ready for lighting, and a per&s;on is appointed to watch at each of them; &s;o that the whole i&s;land, they &s;ay, can be alarmed in the &s;pace of an hour.</P>
<P>The Sicilians have no other means, &s;ays <HI>De Non,</HI> of borrowing on their land, but of the farmers, on the renewal of their lea&s;es; the lands being ever en|tailed on the elde&s;t &s;on, and &s;ubject to no other incum|berance, than annuities for the younger boys, or por|tions for the girls; the feudal laws being in as full force for the nobility, in Sicily, as at the Norman
<PB N="195" REF="198">
conque&s;t, which produces law-&s;uits for inheritances without end; and enriches a &s;warm of lawyers, who are found in crowds at Palermo, and who are all wealthy. Right being here put up to auction, and ju&s;tice become a branch of commerce, all the money in the kingdom flows into this city, through the chan|nel of the tribunals; and is again di&s;tributed among the public, by the luxury of their pre&s;idents and coun|&s;ellors.</P>
<P>Remote from their King, whom they know only by his repre&s;entative, the Sicilians are accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider him as a pen&s;ioner; whom they defraud of his due, whil&s;t they pride them&s;elves in granting him free gifts; and, from time to time, make experiments of di&s;obedience, with the &s;ole view of performing an act that may a&s;&s;ert their freedom.</P>
<P>The Sicilians have had &s;o many &s;overeigns, that they are accu&s;tomed to like none of them; and to give the preference only to him, with whom they can make the be&s;t conditions. They are ever ready to receive the &s;overeign, who e&s;tabli&s;hes his authority by force, or him who grants them the mo&s;t favourable terms; but always with the implied re&s;erve of recur|ring, in ca&s;e of violence and tyranny, to the well-known methods of revolt, Sicilian ve&s;pers, or others
<PB N="196" REF="199">
of the &s;ame nature. Their country furni&s;hing them with all &s;orts of productions in abundance, they are more difficult to reduce, than any nation; it being impo&s;&s;ible to keep them in &s;ubjection, by refu&s;ing them any kind of &s;upplies. They may be de&s;poiled, but can never be &s;tarved, or ruined.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE ISLAND OF MALTA. FROM DE NON, BRYDONE, AND OTHERS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Hi&s;tory, Con&s;titution, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MALTA was anciently called Iberia, afterwards Ogygia; and by the Greeks, Melite; from which, at la&s;t, the Saracens formed the appellation of Malta. Mention is made of this i&s;land, Acts xxviii. Its length is computed at about twenty Italian miles; its greate&s;t breadth twelve; and its circumference &s;ixty. It is &s;ituated in the Mediterranean &s;ea, eighty miles South of Sicily; lying in North Latitude 36, and between 14 and 15 degrees We&s;t Longitude.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="201">Malta, as well as Sicily, was long under the tyranny of the Saracens; from which they were both delivered about the middle of the eleventh century, by the va|lour of the Normans; after which time, the fate of Malta commonly re&s;ted on that of Sicily; till the em|peror <HI>Charles</HI> V. about 1530, gave it, together with the adjoining i&s;land of Gozzo, to the knights of St. <HI>John,</HI> of Jeru&s;alem; who, at that time, had lo&s;t the i&s;land of Rhodes. In te&s;timony of this conce&s;&s;ion, the grand ma&s;ter is &s;till obliged, every year, to &s;end a falcon to the King of Sicily, or his viceroy; and, on every new &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to &s;wear allegiance: and to receive, from the hands of the Sicilian monarch, the inve&s;titure of the&s;e two i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Unproductive in it&s;elf, (for it is one &s;olid rock, not covered five inches with &s;oil) the garri&s;on, and forti|fications nece&s;&s;ary for its defence, were too burthen-&s;ome for its &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;overeigns. It became the emporium, and place of refre&s;hment, for all European ve&s;&s;els, trading in the Mediterranean; and fell, &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively, under the power of every invader. It re|quired, therefore, a &s;overeignty, which, from its na|ture could only remain neuter; too feeble to give um|brage to any other power, and derives all it &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ance from without. It was nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o, that its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, wealthy in other countries, &s;hould bring with them, in &s;pecie, what the i&s;land is obliged to ex|pend
<PB N="199" REF="202">
in the purcha&s;e of articles of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; that they &s;hould be at once monks, &s;oldiers, and bachelors, compo&s;ing one and the &s;ame family; the economy of who&s;e individual members &s;hould revert, by inherit|ance, to the accumulated ma&s;s, which pays the labour, and provides for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, of the active inhabit|ants; who had encrea&s;ed, &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the order, from 10,000, to 50,000, including the two adjoining i&s;les of Gozzo and Cumino.</P>
<P>Could the &s;overeign then do a more politic thing, than be&s;tow it on the knights, as he did; by which it is become an epitome of all Europe, and an a&s;&s;em|blage of the younger brothers, who are commonly the be&s;t, of its fir&s;t families? It is, probably, one of the be&s;t academies for politene&s;s, in this part of the globe; be&s;ides, where every one is entitled, by law, to de|mand &s;atisfaction for the lea&s;t breach of it, people are under a nece&s;&s;ity of being very exact, and circum|&s;pect, in their words and actions.</P>
<P>All the knights, and commanders, have much the appearance of gentlemen, and men of the world. Here are no characters in the extreme. The ridi|cules and prejudices, of every particular nation, are, by degrees &s;oftened, and worn off, by the familiar in|tercour&s;e and colli&s;ion of each other. It is curious, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> to ob&s;erve the effect it produces upon
<PB N="200" REF="203">
various people, that compo&s;e this little medley. The French &s;kip, the German &s;trut, and the Spani&s;h &s;talk, are mingled together, in &s;uch &s;mall proportions, that none are &s;triking; yet every one of the&s;e nations &s;till retain &s;omething of their original chacteri&s;tic; for though the Pari&s;ian has, in a great mea&s;ure, lo&s;t his a&s;&s;uming air; the Spaniard his taciturnity and &s;olem|nity; the German his formality and his pride; yet, &s;till you &s;ee the German, the Frenchman, and the Spaniard.</P>
<P>This in&s;titution, which is a &s;trange compound of military and eccle&s;ia&s;tic, has now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for near &s;even hundred years; and, though one of the fir&s;t-born, has long &s;urvived every other child of chivalry. It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great riches, in mo&s;t of the Catholic coun|ties of Europe; and did &s;o in England, before the time of Henry VIII. but that capricious tyrant &s;eized on all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, when he plundered the church.</P>
<P>The grand ma&s;ter, who is the &s;overeign of this little country, is cho&s;en by a committee of twenty-one, nominated by &s;even nations, three out of each nation. The election mu&s;t be over within three days after the death of the former grand ma&s;ter; and, during the&s;e three days, &s;carce a &s;oul &s;leeps at Malta. All is cabal and intrigue; and mo&s;t of the knights are ma&s;ked, to prevent their particular attachment, and
<PB N="201" REF="204">
connexions from being known. The moment the election is over, every thing returns to its former channel.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the credit of the work from which the following &s;tory is taken, namely, the well-written <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Order of Malta,</HI> by the Abb&eacute; <HI>Vertot,</HI> our readers may po&s;&s;ibly be plea&s;ed with a re|lation of it, as it occurred under the grand ma&s;ter <HI>Helion</HI> of <HI>Villeneuve,</HI> about the year 1342.</P>
<P>On this i&s;land, according to the record of all the authors of that time, was a crocodile of an enormous &s;ize: this amphibious animal kept its abode, in a hol|low ground, at the top of the mountain St. Ettienne, two miles di&s;tant from the town; from whence it made its appearance, from time to time. Sheep, cows, and even &s;hepherds, were &s;uddenly mi&s;&s;ed, and became the prey of this mon&s;ter. Several knights went forth to de&s;troy it, but none returned; but at the com|mencement of the fourteenth century fire-arms were not invented, and the &s;kin of this animal, being co|vered with &s;cales, was impregnable to arrows, and ja|velins. He fought to advantage, and was conqueror in every combat. This urged the grand ma&s;ter to forbid any further attempts of the knights to de&s;troy it, on pain of expul&s;ion from the order.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="205">One only broke through this &s;trict injunction. <HI>Dieu-don de Gozon,</HI> with a heroi&s;m peculiar to the times, determined once more to make the attempt; notwith&s;tanding the ill-fate of his brethren, and the command of the grand ma&s;ter to the contrary; chu&s;ing rather to lo&s;e his life in the conflict, than &s;uffer &s;uch a dangerous animal to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Animated by the true &s;pirit of chivalry, <HI>Gozon</HI> meditated on means to carry his de&s;ign into execution; and retired, for that purpo&s;e, to Ca&s;tle Gozon, in Languedoc. Having ob&s;erved that the crocodile had no &s;cales upon its belly, he regulated his mea&s;ures accordingly.</P>
<P>He ordered a figure of this bea&s;t to be made, in wood, which he carried in his mind, and had it painted of the natural colour. This done, he taught two dogs, at his call, to attack it about the belly; whil&s;t he &s;tood by on hor&s;eback, covered with a coat of mail, and &s;truck him often with his lance.</P>
<P>After having practi&s;ed them in this, for &s;ome months, and taught his dogs perfectly, <HI>Gozon</HI> re|turned to Rhodes. Immediately on his arrival, with|out di&s;covering his intent, he &s;ent his arms, un-noticed, to a church, on the mountain of St. Ettienne, and fol|lowed there him&s;elf, attended by two &s;ervants, whom
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="206" MS="y">
<HEAD>GOZON KILLING the CROCODILE.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="203" REF="207">
he brought with him from France. Having offered up his prayers to God, in the church, he put on his armour, mounted his hor&s;e, and ordered his two &s;er|vants to return to France, in ca&s;e he &s;hould peri&s;h in the combat, and acquaint his countrymen with the di&s;a&s;ter; but, in ca&s;e he &s;hould fortunately wound the mon&s;ter, or kill him, to come up to him with all expedition. He then rode down the mountain, ac|companied by his dogs, and approached the croco|dile's abode, with manly courage. The mon&s;ter ap|peared, and ran at the knight, with open mouth, and eyes flaming with rage and fire. <HI>Gozon</HI> attempted to pierce it with his lance, but without effect; its &s;cales were impenetrable. He was on the point of giving him a &s;econd thru&s;t; but his hor&s;e took fright, at the noi&s;e, and &s;tench, of an animal he had never &s;een be|fore. It darted on one &s;ide, he fell off, and would have cau&s;ed the death of his ma&s;ter, had be not, with wonderful coolne&s;s, drawn his &s;word; and, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his two dogs, attacked the crocodile again. The thru&s;ts of his &s;word were as fruitle&s;s as tho&s;e of his lance. The mon&s;ter threw him down with the &s;troke of his tail; and the knight would inevitably have pe|ri&s;hed, had not his dogs &s;eized the crocodile, by the belly, and &s;everely wounded it.</P>
<P>This gave the knight time to ri&s;e again, and to run his &s;word, to the haft, into the belly of the animal, at
<PB N="204" REF="208">
a place where it was not covered with &s;cales. The blood ran rapidly from the wound, and the mon&s;ter fell, mortally wounded, on its back; and this threw the knight on the ground again. He would now have been pre&s;&s;ed to death, by the weight of the crocodile, had his two &s;ervants not ha&s;tened up, and drawn him from under it. He was in a fit, and they thought him dead; but, having taken the helmet from his head, he opened his eyes; and the fir&s;t agreeable object, that &s;truck him, was the death of the enemy. The honour of having overcome a mon&s;ter, that had been the death of &s;everal of his brethren, gave fre&s;h mo|tion to his blood, and fre&s;h ela&s;ticity to his nerves.</P>
<P>The news of this victory; and the death of the cro|codile, had &s;carce reached the town, when multitudes came forth to the field of battle; and the knights of Malta conducted their brother, in triumph, to the pa|lace of the grand ma&s;ter. But how great was <HI>Gozon</HI>'s a&s;toni&s;hment, when he &s;aw the grand ma&s;ter approach him with anger. Had you forgot my order, &s;aid <HI>Villeneuve,</HI> with the tone of a regent? Can you hope to e&s;cape with impunity, in having offended again&s;t my commands? <HI>Gozon</HI> was in&s;tantly carried to pri&s;on, without being &s;uffered to &s;ay a word in his defence; nor could all that the knights, in general, &s;ay, &s;often <HI>Villeneuve</HI>'s re&s;entment. The grand ma&s;ter called a council of war; and repre&s;ented to them, that it was
<PB N="205" REF="209">
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to puni&s;h his di&s;obedience; which was far more injurious to the order, than many &s;uch mon&s;ters. Like <HI>Manlius,</HI> the Roman, he in&s;i&s;ted upon it that the conqueror &s;hould be puni&s;hed for this victory.</P>
<P>The unfortunate <HI>Gozon</HI> was con&s;equently adjudged to have forfeited the robe of the order; a puni&s;hment more &s;evere to him than death it&s;elf. But the grand ma&s;ter, after having &s;atisfied the law, &s;o arranged matters, that he was reque&s;ted to grant a favour, which he him&s;elf would have begged, had he not been grand ma&s;ter. At the reque&s;t of the knights, he re|&s;tored the robe to the chevalier, and loaded him with favours; and the head of the mon&s;ter was fixed up, at one of the town-gates, as a monument of victory. <HI>Thevenot</HI> &s;ays, in his travels, which he pub|li&s;hed in 1637, either that he &s;aw it, or a picture of it. According to this author, the jaw &s;plit to the ears, his teeth and eyes were of an uncommon &s;ize, the no&s;|trils round, and the colour grey.</P>
<P>We have given this account as we find it in <HI>Vertot,</HI> leaving it to the judgment of our readers to decide on its probability. So much we find in cotemporary writers, from in&s;criptions, and other tokens of the &s;ame period, that chevalier <HI>Gozon</HI> had killed a great formidable animal, and had acquired great honour
<PB N="206" REF="210">
among the people of Rhodes in &s;o doing; who con|&s;idered him as their deliverer. This may ea&s;ily be credited.</P>
<P>The grand ma&s;ter gave him, &s;oon after, &s;everal lu|crative places, to indemnify him; and, finding that <HI>Gozon</HI> had as much prudence as valour, appointed him his lieutenant; convinced that a man, who had &s;o nobly ventured his life for the good of his coun|trymen; would defend them, in war, again&s;t any en|terpize of an enemy, with equal, if not &s;till greater, courage.</P>
<P>Of this renowned man we will give another anec|dote, &s;till more characteri&s;tic. The grand ma&s;ter, <HI>Vil|leneuve,</HI> died in 1346. Many a&s;pired to this im|portant office. The elder knights, though re&s;ting in peace, after the actions of their younger days, wi&s;hed for a grand ma&s;ter of a peaceful di&s;po&s;ition. The younger ones were of a contrary turn; they coveted a keen and fiery chief, who would lead them to war; and give them an opportunity of acquiring glory and riches. <HI>Gozon</HI> was one of the competitors; and, on entering the council, or conclave, he &s;aid, "On my admi&s;&s;ion here, I took a &s;olemn oath to give my &s;uf|frage to the worthie&s;t knight; and propo&s;e, to this ex|alted po&s;t, the man, who, in my opinion, has mo&s;t the good of the order at heart. Having con&s;idered &s;e|riou&s;ly
<PB N="207" REF="211">
on the &s;tate of Chri&s;tendom; having taken into con&s;ideration the continual war we have to carry on again&s;t the Infidels; in a word, having impartially con&s;idered that firmne&s;s of character, which a grand ma&s;ter ought to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, in order to &s;upport the laws with re&s;pect, to counteract every di&s;order in the &s;tate, and &s;hew an intrepidity in the mo&s;t dan|gerous &s;ituations; I having weighed all this in my mind, I declare it to be my opinion, that no one can fill this po&s;t better than&mdash;my&s;elf." <HI>Gozon</HI> then en|larged, in a very eloquent &s;peech, on his own merits and virtues. The combat with the mon&s;ter was not forgotten, but he particularly brought to mind his con|duct, whil&s;t he was lieutenant to the grand ma&s;ter. "You already know," continued he, "my manner of governing;&mdash;you know what you have to expect from me;&mdash;and you know al&s;o that you cannot, without inju&s;tice, deny me your votes." The &s;urprized a&s;|&s;embly acknowledged his merits, and cho&s;e him grand ma&s;ter, unanimou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Since this time it has been the cu&s;tom to a&s;k for the grand ma&s;ter&s;hip of Malta, without having killed a mon&s;ter.</P>
<P>The grand ma&s;ter of Malta is called Serene High|ne&s;s, and Eminence. He has the di&s;po&s;al of all lu|crative places, makes whom he plea&s;es of his council;
<PB N="208" REF="212">
and in all the councils, that compo&s;e the juri&s;diction of this little nation, he pre&s;ides him&s;elf, and has two votes. He has the di&s;po&s;al of twenty-one commen|daries, worth upwards of &pound;. 2000 a year, and one pri|ory every five years; and, as there are always a num|ber of competitors, and expectants, he is very much cru&s;hed. He is always a prie&s;t; and e&s;teems his &s;i|tuation the mo&s;t eminent a private individual can ob|tain, except the Papacy. In &s;hort, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> he is more ab&s;olute, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more power, than mo&s;t &s;overeign princes. His hou&s;hold attendance, and court, are all very princely; and yet, &s;ays <HI>De Non,</HI> he is only what a con&s;ul was at Rome, an archon at Athens; and what a landman now is in Switzerland. But he has a privy council; where every matter, to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, mu&s;t be propo&s;ed by the grand ma&s;ter; &s;o that, unle&s;s he &s;ees he can carry his point, he is &s;ilent; and, of cour&s;e, ab&s;olute. Notwith&s;tanding this, he may not be &s;o happy. Surrounded by ambi|tious pretenders, his court is a prey to intrigue; and his territory is &s;o limited, that he can never remove far from his tomb, towards which he will ha&s;ten, though a thou&s;and of his brotherhood regret that his ap|proaches are &s;o &s;low. Nay, when within his palace, under ties to all the &s;overeigns of Europe, who grant unmeaning honours to his flag; and without a force &s;ufficient to act the part of a neutral power, he is continually reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of making apo|logies;
<PB N="209" REF="213">
and to atone, for every &s;eeming offence, to tho&s;e princes who demand it; and, in his own country, &s;urrounded with fortifications, with mortars, and with cannon, this unfortunate &s;overeign is perpetually, on the defence, again&s;t inte&s;tine cabals, con&s;piracies, and revolts; and cannot have a moment's ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The land-force of Malta is equal to the number of men in the i&s;land, fit to bear arms. They have about five hundred regulars, belonging to the &s;hips of war; and one hundred and fifty compo&s;e the guard of the prince. The two i&s;lands, of Malta and Gozzo, con|tain about one hundred and fifty thou&s;and inhabitants. The men are exceedingly robu&s;t and hardy; and will row &s;tanding, &s;hoving the handle of the oars from them, for ten or twelve hours, without intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Their navy con&s;i&s;ts of four gallies, three galliots, four &s;hips, of &s;ixty guns, and a frigate of thirty-&s;ix; be&s;ides a number of quick &s;ailing little ve&s;&s;els, called <HI>Scampaira's,</HI> or run-aways. Their &s;hips, gallies, and fortifications, are not only well &s;upplied with excel|lent artillery, but they have invented an ordnance of their own, unknown to all the world be&s;ides; their very rocks are cut into artillery, being hollowed out, in many places, in the form of va&s;t mortars; the charge of which is &s;aid to be a barrel of gunpowder; on which they place a lage piece of wood, made ex|actly
<PB N="210" REF="214">
to fit the mouth of the chamber. On this they heap a great quantity of cannon balls, &s;hells, or other deadly materials; and, when an enemy's &s;hip ap|proaches the harbour, they fire the whole into the air; making a &s;hower, for two or three hundred yards round, that would &s;ink any ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P><HI>Brydone</HI> has ju&s;t &s;een the naval force of Malta, in its greate&s;t gala. It was the departure of a Malte&s;e &s;quadron, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the French again&s;t the Bey of Tu|nis; who had offended the French King, by refu&s;ing to deliver up, without ran&s;om, the Cor&s;ican &s;laves, that were taken, before the French were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that i&s;land. The &s;quadron con&s;i&s;ted of three gal|lies, the large&s;t with nine hundred men; each of the others with &s;even hundred; three galliots, and &s;everal <HI>&s;campaira's.</HI> The&s;e immen&s;e bodies were all worked by oars, and moved with great regularity. The ad|miral went fir&s;t, and the re&s;t in order, according to their dignity. The &s;ea was crouded with boats, it was a fine evening, and the ramparts, and fortifica|tions, were filled with company. The port re&s;ounded, on all &s;ides, with the di&s;charge of heavy artillery, an|nounced by the gallies, and galliots, as they left the harbour; and, as the echo here is uncommonly great, it had a very noble effect. There were about thirty knights in each galley, making &s;ignals, all the way, to
<PB N="211" REF="215">
their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who were weeping for their departure upon the ba&s;tions.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;uppo&s;ed bigotry of the Mal|te&s;e, the &s;pirit of toleration is &s;o &s;trong, that they have &s;uffered the Turks, their &s;worn enemies, to erect a mo&s;que, and puni&s;h any who di&s;turb them.</P>
<P>Perhaps Malta is the only country where duelling is permitted by law; for, as their e&s;tabli&s;hment origi|nated in chivalry, they appear, in &s;ome points, to keep it up; though they &s;o re&s;trict this toleration, as greatly to le&s;&s;en its danger. The dueli&s;ts are obliged to fight in one particular &s;treet of the city; and are obliged, under &s;evere cen&s;ure, to put up their &s;words, when ordered &s;o to do by a <HI>woman,</HI> a <HI>prie&s;t,</HI> or a <HI>knight.</HI> But even this does not prevent blood&s;hed. A cro&s;s is always painted on the wall, oppo&s;ite to the &s;pot where a knight has been killed in a duel; and this is in com|memoration of his fall. <HI>Brydone</HI> &s;ays he counted about twenty of &s;uch cro&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Brydone</HI> &s;ays, about three months before he was there, two knights had a di&s;pute at a billiard table. One of them, after a great deal of abu&s;ive language, gave the other a blow; and, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all Malta, after &s;o great an affront, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to fight his antagoni&s;t.&mdash;The challenge was repeated;
<PB N="212" REF="216">
he had time to reflect on the con&s;equences, and &s;till refu&s;ed. For this he was condemned to make the <HI>amende honorable,</HI> in the great church, for forty-five days, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; then to be confined to a dark dun|geon, for five years; and, after this, to remain a pri|&s;oner for life. The unfortunate young man, who re|ceived the blow, was al&s;o in di&s;grace, not having had an opportunity of wiping it out, in the blood of his adver&s;ary.</P>

<P>MR. <HI>Brydone,</HI> and his company, approached Malta by &s;ea; having pa&s;&s;ed from Sicily in a &s;ix-oared &s;hallow boat, &s;carce able to hold &s;ix per&s;ons, be&s;ides the rowers; but the &s;ea, in the channel between the two i&s;lands, being pretty calm, at certain &s;ea&s;ons, it is the only ve&s;&s;el that pa&s;&s;es it.</P>
<P>The a&s;pect of the country, &s;ays he, is far from plea&s;ing; the whole being, as I ob&s;erved, on a rock

of free-&s;tone, thinly covered with earth; yet their crops, in general, were abundant, owing to the dews that fall, during the &s;pring and &s;ummer months, and their corn and cotton looked well; it was then in the beginning of the month of June. Their barley har|ve&s;t was then over, and they were ju&s;t fini&s;hing that of wheat. All the corn, grown in the i&s;land, will &s;upport the people but five months; the crop they mu&s;t depend on is the cotton. They begin &s;owing in the middle of May, fini&s;h in the middle of June, and reap in October, and beginning of November.</P>
<P>The cotton-plant ri&s;es to the height of eighteen inches, and is covered with a number of nuts, or pods, full of cotton. The&s;e, when ripe, they cut off every morning, before the &s;un ri&s;es; as the &s;un's heat turns it yellow. They manufacture this into a variety of &s;tuffs, and very fine &s;tockings; &s;ome have been &s;old for ten &s;equins a pair, near &s;even pounds ten &s;hillings Engli&s;h. Their wor&s;teds and blankets are e&s;teemed all over Europe. The chief manufactures are at Gozzo. Small quantities of the &s;ugar-cane are here cultivated. The Malte&s;e oranges are reckoned the fine&s;t in the world. The trees are covered with fruit, from November till the middle of June. They are red oranges; the juice is red as blood; being the common orange-bud, grafted on the pomegranate &s;tock. The greate&s;t part of this crop is &s;ent, as pre|&s;ents,
<PB N="214" REF="218">
to crowned-heads, and to the relations of the knights.</P>
<P>The indu&s;try of the Malte&s;e, in cultivating their little i&s;land, is inconceivable. There is not an inch of ground lo&s;t in any part of it; and, where the &s;oil failed, they have covered the &s;tone with earth, brought from Sicily, in &s;hips and boats. The whole i&s;land is full of enclo&s;ures of free-&s;tone; which, in &s;ummer, reflects &s;o much light, and heat, as to be very trou|ble&s;ome to the eyes.</P>
<P>The i&s;land is covered with country-hou&s;es, and vil|lages, be&s;ides the towns which they call cities; though there are only two, the Valetta, and the Citta Vec|chia, that de&s;erve that name. Every little village has a noble church, elegantly fini&s;hed, and adorned with marble &s;tatues, rich tape&s;try, and a profu&s;ion of &s;ilver plate. They are, &s;ays <HI>Brydone,</HI> by much the hand|&s;ome&s;t churches I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>The city of Valetta &s;tands upon a penin&s;ula, be|tween two of the fine&s;t ports in the world; which are defended, by almo&s;t impregnable fortifications. That on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of the city is the large&s;t, is &s;carce a quarter of a mile broad, at the mouth, com|manded, on each &s;ide, by batteries that would tear the &s;tronge&s;t &s;hip to pieces, before &s;he could enter.

it is fronted by a quadruple battery, one above another; the large&s;t of which is on a level with the water. Within the mouth, the harbour widens into a beautiful ba&s;on; running up two miles into the heart of the i&s;land; divided into five di&s;tinct harbours, all equally &s;afe; each capable of containing an immen&s;e number of &s;hipping. The &s;oundings are here &s;o very deep, and &s;urrounded by &s;uch high grounds, and forti|fications, that the large&s;t &s;hips of war may ride here, al|mo&s;t without a cable, in the roughe&s;t weather. The&s;e batteries are mounted with about eighty of their heavie&s;t artillery; and the harbour, of cour&s;e, may be con&s;i|dered as impregnable. The Turks have ever found it &s;o.</P>
<P>The harbour, on the north &s;ide of the city, although only u&s;ed for fi&s;hing, and as a place of quarantine, would, in any other part of the world, be con&s;idered as ine&s;timable. It is ably defended by very &s;trong works; and in the centre of the ba&s;on is an i&s;land, on which is built a ca&s;tle and a lazaretto.</P>
<P>The fortifications of Malta are indeed a mo&s;t &s;tu|penduous work. All the boa&s;ted catacombs of Rome, and Naples, are a trifle to the immen&s;e excavations that have been made in this little i&s;land. The ditches, of a va&s;t &s;ize, are all cut out of a &s;olid rock. The&s;e extend for many miles, and rai&s;e our a&s;toni&s;hment to
<PB N="216" REF="221">
think that &s;o &s;mall a &s;tate has been ever able to make them.</P>
<P>One &s;ide of the i&s;land is &s;o completely fortified by nature, that there was nothing left for art. The rock is of a great height, and ab&s;olutely perpendicular, from the &s;ea, for &s;everal miles. Yet, even on this &s;ide, there are &s;till the ve&s;tiges of &s;everal ancient roads, with the tracks of carriages worn deep in the rocks. The&s;e roads are now terminated by the pre|cipices with the &s;ea beneath; and clearly &s;hew that, in former ages, this i&s;land has been much larger than it is. Indeed it has often been ob&s;erved to have been affected by the irruption of mount Aetna; which may be clearly &s;een from this. They reckon the di&s;|tance near two hundred Italian miles; and the people declare that, during the irruption, the whole i&s;land is illuminated; and, from the reflection in the water, there appears a great track of fire in the &s;ea, all the way from Malta to Sicily. The thundering of the mountain is al&s;o di&s;tinctly heard.</P>
<P>The city of Valetta is built upon a hill. None of the &s;treets, except the key, are level. They are all paved with white free-&s;tone, which creates a great du&s;t; and, by its glare, burts the eyes of the people. There are two good inns in the town. Beautiful and &s;pacious flights of &s;tone &s;teps conduct to large
<PB N="217" REF="222">
&s;treets, perfectly &s;trait, and well paved. The hou&s;es are built of free &s;tone, and continue &s;o beautifully white, as to look like new. In &s;hort, on approaching the harbour, the &s;uperb pro&s;pect, within its innumer|able forts, and its two towns, the old and the new, built in an amphitheatre, gives it an appearance, and renders it more magnificent, than any other city in the world. Every edifice, public and private, is re|markably well-built; and the whole &s;eems founded on va&s;t, and noble ba&s;tions.</P>
<P>The principal public buildings are, the palace, the infirmary, the ar&s;enal, the hotels of the &s;even tongues of the great church of St <HI>John.</HI>&mdash;The palace is a noble, though plain, &s;tructure; and the grand ma&s;ter is more comfortably lodged than any prince in Eu|rope, except the King of Sardinia. St. <HI>John</HI>'s is a magnificent church; the pavement is reckoned the riche&s;t in the world. It is entirely compo&s;ed of &s;e|pulchral monuments, of the fine&s;t marbles, porphyry, lapis lazuli, and a variety of other valuable &s;tones, admirably joined together, at an incredible expence; repre&s;enting, in a kind of Mo&s;aic, the arms, in&s;ignia, &amp;c. of the per&s;ons they commemorate. There are but two inns, as I have ob&s;erved, in this city, the Fal|con and the Three Kings; the accommodations are good, the treatment civil, and the entertainment of the be&s;t, for half-a-crown a day, each.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="223">No &s;pot on earth can be more fortunate, and more fertile, than Sicily; none can be more unfruitful, more barren, or more wretchedly &s;ituated, &s;ays <HI>De Non,</HI> than Malta. In Sicily crops of every kind are produced; and though they rapidly &s;ucceed, and pre&s;s upon each other, the pea&s;ant, there, is poor, languid, and di&s;gu&s;tingly dirty. At Malta, the farmer can force from the &s;oil a little corn, and cotton; yet poverty there is &s;o active, &s;o indu&s;trious, and &s;o neat, that it has the air only of ab&s;tinence. Large breeches and a &s;hirt of blue linen, a broad &s;a&s;h, and the arms and feet left naked, form the whole de&s;cription of the light dre&s;s and ornaments of the Malte&s;e. Their features and complexion are as Arabian as their lan|guage. Intere&s;ting and artful in all their bargains, they are &s;cupulou&s;ly faithful, in fulfilling every con|tract, which renders all commercial intercour&s;e with them &s;afe, and ea&s;y. The women are exempted from every kind of labour, which is entirely performed by the men, even to the mo&s;t trivial hou&s;hold-work. In imitation of the Levantine and Ea&s;tern cu&s;toms, it &s;eems as if they limited the u&s;e of the &s;ex, to the &s;ole department of plea&s;ure. Though under a burning &s;ky, they po&s;&s;e&s;s the fair &s;kin of the inhabitants of the North, with the impa&s;&s;ioned expre&s;&s;ion of the Ori|entals; their beauty is neither Grecian, nor maje&s;tic. but is not, on that account, the le&s;s &s;educing. With fine complexions, which they carefully pre&s;erve, they
<PB N="219" REF="224">
have almo&s;t all of them large eyes; in which love &s;eems to lie in ambu&s;h, beneath their long eyelids, that gives them a plea&s;ing air of languor, not a little re&s;embling mode&s;ty. Tho&s;e of the country are &s;aid to be faithful to their hu&s;bands; but the women of the city know no more how to re&s;i&s;t the gold of Ba|illis, than the amorous &s;ighs of the youthful knights; and we accordingly find, at Malta, the utmo&s;t licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s of celibacy. Their cre&s;&s;es di&s;play more of coquetry than magnificence. Elegance and neatne&s;s con&s;titute their luxury. They have a cu&s;tom of &s;having them&s;elves, like the men; but then it is with &s;o much art, that you mu&s;t come very clo&s;e to them, to di&s;cover the voluptuous effect of this practi&s;e. This operation they perform, very dextrou&s;ly, with broken gla&s;s.</P>
<P>The 6th of June is held as a thank&s;giving for their deliverance from a terrible con&s;piracy, that was formed, between thirty and forty years ago, by the Turki&s;h &s;laves; at one &s;troke to put an end to the whole order of Malta. All the fountains of the palace were to be poi&s;oned; and every &s;lave had taken a &s;olemn oath to put his ma&s;ter to death.</P>
<P>It was di&s;covered by a Jew, who kept a coffee-hou&s;e. He under&s;tood the Turki&s;h language; and, over-hearing &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e he thought &s;u&s;picious, went
<PB N="220" REF="225">
and informed the grand ma&s;ter. The &s;u&s;pected per|&s;ons were in&s;tantly &s;eized, and put to the torture, and &s;oon confe&s;&s;ed the whole. The executions were &s;hocking. One hundred and twenty-five were put to death, by various torments; &s;ome were burned alive, &s;ome were broken on the wheel, and &s;ome torn to pieces by four gallies, rowing different ways, and each bringing off its limb. Since that time the &s;laves have been more narrowly watched, and have le&s;s li|berty, than formerly.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e-races of Malta are of a very uncommon kind; performed without either &s;addle, bridle, whip, or &s;pur; and yet the hor&s;es run full &s;peed, and af|ford much diver&s;ion. They are accu&s;tomed to the ground for &s;ome weeks before; and, though it is en|tirely over rock and pavement, there are &s;eldom any accidents. They have races of a&s;&s;es and mules, per|formed in the &s;ame manner, four times a year. The rider is only furni&s;hed with a weapon like a &s;hoe|maker's awl, to pu&s;h on his cour&s;er, if he is lazy.</P>
<P>The ancient city of Melita &s;tands, nearly, in the centre of the i&s;land; and, from its high &s;ituation, commands a view of the whole; and, in clear wea|ther, they &s;ay, of part of Barbary and Sicily. It is &s;trongly fortified, and governed by an officer, called the <HI>Hahem.</HI> The cathedral is a fine church, exceed|ingly
<PB N="221" REF="226">
large; and was hung, when <HI>Brydone</HI> was there, with crim&s;on dama&s;k, richly laced with gold.</P>
<P>Not far from the old city is a &s;mall church, dedi|cated to St. <HI>Paul;</HI> and ju&s;t by the church, a miracu|lous &s;tatue of the Saint, with a viper in his hand; &s;up|po&s;ed to be placed on the very &s;pot on which the hou&s;e &s;tood, where he was received after his &s;hipwreck on this i&s;land; and where he &s;hook the viper off his hand, into the fire, without being hurt by it; at which time, the Malte&s;e &s;ay, the Saint cur&s;ed all the ve|nomous animals of the i&s;land, and bani&s;hed them for ever; as St <HI>Peter</HI> healed tho&s;e of his favourite i&s;le. Whether this be the cau&s;e or not, there are no ve|nomous animals in Malta; and the people &s;ay, that vipers have been brought from Sicily, and died, al|mo&s;t, immediately on their arrival.</P>
<P>Adjoining the church there is the celebrated grotto, in which St. <HI>Paul</HI> was impri&s;oned. It is very damp, and produces a whiti&s;h kind of &s;tone; which, they aver, when reduced to powder, is a &s;overeign remedy in many di&s;ea&s;es. Boxes of it are &s;ent, annually, to Sicily, Italy, the Levant, and the Ea&s;t Indies; and what is con&s;idered as a &s;tanding miracle, notwith|&s;tanding this con&s;umption, it has never been exhau&s;ted, nor ever &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hed; the Saint always taking care to &s;upply them, with a fre&s;h quantity, the day

following. It is &s;omething like magne&s;ia, in look and ta&s;te. They give a tea-&s;poonful to children in fevers, and the &s;mall-pox; which produces a copious &s;weat, about an hour after, and never fails, they &s;ay, to be of &s;ervice. It is e&s;teemed a certain remedy again&s;t the bite of all venomous animals. There is a very fine &s;tatue of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in the middle of this grotto, to which is a&s;cribed great power. St. <HI>Paul,</HI> after his &s;hipwreck, continued in this i&s;land three months, and preached the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The catacombs, not far from this city, are a great work. They are &s;aid to extend fifteen miles under ground. Many people, they &s;ay, have been lo&s;t in tracing them; for, branching out into &s;o many parts, they could not find their way back. The pa&s;|&s;ages, or galleries, are &s;o very narrow, that only one per&s;on can pa&s;s at a time; but they are well fini&s;hed, and well pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>The grand ma&s;ter's country palace is repre&s;ented as an exten&s;ive place, with fine hunting in the woods; but, in fact, it only contains a few &s;cattered trees, and about half-a-dozen deers; yet, this being the only thing like a wood in the i&s;land, it is e&s;teemed a great curio&s;ity. The palace is as poor a thing; and the fur|niture three or four hundred years old, in the mo&s;t Gothic ta&s;te; but the grand ma&s;ter never re&s;ides here.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="228">Great &s;ource of water, that &s;upplies the city of Valetta, takes its ri&s;e near this place; and is conveyed by an aqueduct of &s;ome thou&s;and arches. The car|riages, to pa&s;s from one part of the i&s;land to another, are coaches drawn by one mule; the only kind of ve|hicle they have.</P>
<P>Indeed you here go out of town, without finding the country; for what is &s;o called, is as much covered with buildings, as the city, and &s;eems as &s;trongly for|tified, by large continued walls, which hold up or in|ca&s;e the little earth there is naturally in the i&s;land, or what is brought, or fabricated there; for, by breaking the &s;oft &s;oil, and mixing it with earth and rolling it, the indefatigable Malte&s;e compo&s;e a &s;oil fit for cotton, and they abandon, almo&s;t, every other &s;pecies of cul|ture for this; which, by its &s;ale, &s;upplies the want of every other production.</P>
<P>The grand ma&s;ter has lately laid the foundation of a mu&s;eum, to be the property of the order, as is the li|brary, which is con&s;iderable. They have found &s;ome marble bas-reliefs here, Roman works, which appear, &s;ays <HI>De Non,</HI> to be portraits; among the&s;e is a head of <HI>Cicero</HI>'s daughter.</P>
<P>The i&s;le of Gozzo has been imagined, by many of our modern antiquaries, to have been the i&s;land of
<PB N="224" REF="229">
<HI>Calyp&s;o;</HI> but this opinion has been &s;ome years out of fa&s;hion; and though there is nothing at Malta, which in the lea&s;t re&s;embles the de&s;cription of that i&s;land, by <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Fenelon,</HI> they have now transferred the re&s;idence of that amorous nymph there; and placed her palace at the bottom of the harbour of <HI>la Melleha.</HI> Here are a number of romantic characters, cut out of the rock, more like hermit's cells than any other thing; and yet they call one of the&s;e <HI>Calyp&s;o</HI>'s dre&s;&s;ing room. It is po&s;&s;ible for imagination to de&s;troy all that now exi&s;ts, and &s;uppo&s;e things to exi&s;t, which never could exi&s;t; yet &s;till it is imagination, after all, and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>The Greeks, undoubtedly, had &s;ettlements at Goz|zo; for &s;ome coins, of Gozzo it&s;elf, are found, re|pre&s;enting a head of <HI>Diana,</HI> with a cre&s;cent over it; and, on the other &s;ide, a &s;oldier armed with a &s;word and buckler, in the action of attack.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP I.</HI> Situation, Extent, and general View.</HEAD>
<P>THE dominions of the Holy See compo&s;e what the Italians call <HI>&s;tato della chie&s;a;</HI> and are bounded, on the North, by the territories of the &s;tates of Venice; by the Adriatic Sea, on the North-Ea&s;t; by Naples, on the South-Ea&s;t; by the Tu&s;can Sea, on the South-We&s;t; by Tu&s;cany, on the North-We&s;t; and by the duchies of Modena and Mantua, on the We&s;t; which it encompa&s;&s;es on three &s;ides.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="232">The&s;e dominions con&s;i&s;t of the compagna of Rome; St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s patrimony; the duchies of Ca&s;tro, Spo|letto and Urbino; the marqui&s;ate of Ancona; the Sabine&s;e, the Romagna; which comprehends the Bo|logne&s;e and duchy of Ferrara; the Perrugin; and the territory of Orvieto. Be&s;ides the&s;e provinces, the duchy of Benevento, in the kingdom of Naples, and the county of Avignon, in the South of France, belong to the Pope.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t length of this country may be about two hundred and forty Italian miles; as to the breadth, from Civita Vecchia to Ancona, is about one hun|dred and thirty miles; but, in many other places, it is not near &s;o broad; and, in &s;ome parts, is &s;carce twenty miles.</P>
<P>On con&s;idering that the Pope's dominions gene|rally con&s;i&s;t of a very fertile, and excellent &s;oil; that his harbours, both on the Adriatic and Mediterranean &s;eas, are very advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated for trade; that he receives con&s;iderable &s;ums from other parts; that his country is vi&s;ited by numbers of foreigners, who &s;pend a great deal of money in it; and that, on account of the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;anctity of his per&s;on and character, his government &s;hould &s;eem be&s;t calculated for the welfare of his &s;ubjects: one would be apt to
<PB N="227" REF="233">
imagine that, of all &s;tates, this ought to be the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing, were not the rever&s;e manife&s;t.</P>
<P>The country is but ill cultivated, and very poor, and thin of inhabitants; the city of Bologna, alone, excepted. Trade and manufactures are totally &s;tag|nant; and did not the bounty of Providence furni&s;h the inhabitants with dates, almonds, figs, olives, fruits, and &s;uch like products of the earth, growing &s;ponta|neou&s;ly, and without any culture; and deal out to them bread and wine, at the expence of very little labour, their &s;loth would ab&s;olutely &s;tarve them.</P>
<P>Their little inclination, and &s;pirit for work, is not to be wondered at; becau&s;e they are con&s;cious, that if they have much, much will be taken from them; and, in the end, nothing will be left them. The many holidays, which are &s;uch an impediment to trade and bu&s;ine&s;s; the great number of young &s;turdy beg|gars, &s;trolling about, and burthening the inhabitants, under the appearance of pilgrims; the many ho&s;pi|tals, which confirm the people in idlene&s;s; the multi|tude of convents, that hinder the increa&s;e of inha|bitants; the inconceivable wealth of churches and convents, which lie dormant, without the lea&s;t ad|vantage to the public; the inqui&s;ition, which will not permit the want of the inhabitants to be &s;upplied, by tho&s;e of another religion; are &s;ome great cau&s;es of
<PB N="228" REF="234">
the wretched condition of the papal dominions; though there are others attended with &s;till wor&s;e con&s;equences.</P>
<P>No government equals the papal in rigour; the temporal &s;word being not the only one u&s;ed; but al&s;o, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, the &s;piritual, or inqui&s;ition. Be&s;ides, nothing is &s;o mon&s;trous as the pa&s;&s;ion by which popes, cardinals, and other great prelates have been carried away, for enriching and promoting their nephews and relations; and nothing is &s;o vain as the ambition of gaining for them&s;elves a great name, by founding convents and churches. The regulars vie with each other in the number, &s;plendor, and riches of their churches and chapels; but it is from the &s;weat of the poor inhabitants that the money is gene|rally extracted for the &s;upport of this frivolous rival|&s;hip. The legates, governors, and other inferior of|ficers in the provinces, knowing that the time of hold|ing their charge is &s;hort and uncertain, &s;cruple no kind of rapaciou&s;ne&s;s. By collating the&s;e cau&s;es it will no longer be a &s;ubject of &s;urprize, if, in all parts of Europe, there is not a more wretched people than the Pope's temporal &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The campagna of Rome, in which is &s;itu|ated the capital, is the mo&s;t depopulated, and un|healthy, of all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical territories. This

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the City of Rome.</HEAD>
<P>ROME, the metropolis of the dominions of the Pope, and anciently the whole Roman empire, derives its name, according to &s;ome ancient writers, from <HI>Roma,</HI> a Trojan lady; but according to others, from <HI>Romulus,</HI> the founder. There are &s;ome who af|firm
<PB N="230" REF="237">
it was called <HI>Roma,</HI> before the days of <HI>Romulus;</HI> and that he only enlarged the city, and it was called after his name; as princes and great men are, to this day, named from the places of their re&s;idence. Others reject the &s;tory of <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Remus,</HI> as fa|bulous; and indeed nothing &s;atisfactory is to be met with on this &s;ubject, any more than as to the aera of its foundation; &s;ome writers affirming it was founded in the year of the world 3301, or, 753 years before Chri&s;t; and others in the year 3198.</P>
<P>This city is &s;ituated on the river Tyber, about &s;ix|teen miles North-Ea&s;t of the Tu&s;can Sea; in 41 de|grees and 45 minutes of North latitude; and thirty-two degrees odd minutes, to the ea&s;tward of London.</P>
<P>The city of Rome has &s;uffered &s;o much from the an|cient Gauls, Vandals, Heruli, O&s;tro and Vi&s;i-Goths, and la&s;tly from the German troops, e&s;pecially in the year 1527, under <HI>Charles</HI> of Bourbon, that, be&s;ides &s;maller damages, it is computed to have been pillaged &s;even times. Others affirm that Rome was plundered twelve times; this, however, is certain, that the &s;urface of the ground the city &s;tands upon mu&s;t have been al|tered, by &s;uch frequent ravages. At pre&s;ent it is dif|ficult to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;even hills, on which Rome was anciently built; the low grounds having been filled up by the ruins of whole &s;treets; &s;o that, &s;ome|times,
<PB N="231" REF="238">
it is &s;carce ob&s;ervable that we are a&s;cending an eminence, celebrated by the ancients. Antiquity informs us that the a&s;cent, from the &s;treet into the pantheon, or rotunda, con&s;i&s;ted of thirteen &s;teps; whereas now the whole area about it is on a level with the pavement of that temple. It is very common, by digging deep for the foundation of hou&s;es, &amp;c. to find pillars, &s;tatues, and the fragments of ancient buildings; and, in &s;ome places, parts of the pave|ment of the old city have been found to be twenty, or thirty, feet below the pre&s;ent &s;urface of the ground. It is probable, that this mu&s;t al&s;o have occa&s;ioned great alteration, with regard to the &s;alubrity of the air.</P>
<P>The &s;tupendous <HI>Cloacoe,</HI> or common &s;hores and aqueducts, by which the filth and dirt of the ancient city were conveyed into the <HI>Cloaca maxima,</HI> have, in|deed, many openings remaining for the pa&s;&s;age of the &s;oil and water; but mo&s;t of the outlets are &s;topped, and the <HI>Cloaca maxima</HI> it&s;elf is in very bad order. This mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily cau&s;e a putrefaction in the air, which is &s;en&s;ibly perceived by tho&s;e who dig deep into the earth, and happen to light on the aperture of &s;uch ob&s;tructed &s;ink, or &s;hore; there being many in&s;tances of workmen lo&s;ing their lives by tho&s;e pu|trid effluviae. The &s;ame alterations are likewi&s;e ma|nife&s;t in the country. Anciently &s;everal parts of Italy, near the &s;ea, were not only full of fine towns, villas
<PB N="232" REF="239">
and palaces, but re&s;orted to, as the mo&s;t healthy places, in time of pe&s;tilence; but now it is quite the rever&s;e: for the greate&s;t part of the &s;ea-coa&s;t is moi&s;t and mar&s;hy; and the air &s;o bad, that, during the &s;um|mer-heats, many convents are uninhabited; and the monks remove, for &s;ome months, to a healthier cli|mate. Even in the neighbourhood of Rome the &s;oil is but badly cultivated; and, in the night-time, covered with fogs, and igneous vapours. The&s;e mu&s;t have been very uncommon in the time of the ancient Ro|mans; for <HI>Livy</HI> frequently mentions &s;uch phoenomena as prodigies, and omens, which occa&s;ioned propiti|atory &s;acrifice and offerings. Sulphur is u&s;ually dug up, like white earth, at Rome, and afterwards purified by &s;ublimation. Great quantities of vitriol are al&s;o made here; and the green, found in the copper mines, is particularly called Roman vitriol. Roch allum is al&s;o prepared within a &s;mall di&s;tance of Rome; and, in &s;ome places, ar&s;enic is made. The&s;e are works which nece&s;&s;arily produce very noxious effluvia, from which ancient Rome was free; for the&s;e minerals were then either unknown, or, at lea&s;t, not dug up.</P>
<P>It is probable a concurrence of all the&s;e cau&s;es may have occa&s;ioned that alteration of weather, which has been ob&s;erved, with regard to the mildne&s;s of the winters, in this climate. Some pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Homer</HI> &s;hew, that, in his time, the &s;now often lay very deep
<PB N="233" REF="240">
in the &s;treets of Rome; and it is plain, from the &s;ixth &s;atyre of <HI>Juvenal,</HI> that it was far from being unu&s;ual to &s;ee the Tyber frozen in winter; but, in the pre&s;ent age, it mu&s;t be a very &s;harp winter, if the &s;now lays in Rome but a day or two; as for the Tyber, it has not been frozen in the memory of any man living.</P>
<P>The river al&s;o has &s;uffered by the alteration of the countries, through which it takes its cour&s;e; its mouth, where it di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the &s;ea, is be|come very narrow, and choaked with &s;and-banks; and its bed, by the rubbi&s;h of hou&s;es on its banks, very much contracted; which, in a &s;trong &s;outh wind, cau&s;es inundations, that do great damage, both in the city, and the neighbouring country,</P>
<P>In regard to its pre&s;ent extent, and number of in|habitants, &s;everal cities may be found, both in Europe and other parts of the world, &s;uperior to modern Rome; but if we con&s;ider its ancient power, and its &s;overeignty over &s;o many powerful nations, for &s;uch a &s;eries of years, the whole world never produced its equal. The remains of the ancient walls and build|ings of the city demon&s;trate, that, for its va&s;t circum|ference, it might ju&s;tly be cla&s;&s;ed among the princi|pal cities in the world. According to <HI>Pliny</HI> the city walls, in <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI>'s time, were thirteen thou&s;and paces, in circumference; and <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> who wrote in <HI>Aure|lius</HI>'s
<PB N="234" REF="241">
time, magnifies them to fifty thou&s;and. This mu&s;t either be a notorious error in the tran&s;criber, or &s;uch a circuit mu&s;t have included the &s;eats, and gar|dens, in the neigbourhood of Rome. What <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> in his <HI>Varioe Ob&s;ervationes,</HI> endeavours to prove, is very weak and ab&s;urd; for he fain would per&s;uade his readers, that Rome was twenty times as large as Paris and London, put together; that <HI>Nero</HI>'s palace, alone, occupied more ground, than the greate&s;t of our modern European cities; that the number of &s;laves, in Rome, amounted to eight millions; and the inha|bitants, in general, to fourteen millions. Whoever gives credit to the&s;e bare a&s;&s;ertions, &s;hould not di&s;|pute with him, when he affirms, the inhabitants of Nanquin, a &s;ingle city in China, to be above twenty millions. The&s;e exaggerations are &s;till far &s;hort of <HI>Rolefincks,</HI> who computes the inhabitants of Rome, in her highe&s;t pro&s;perity, at twenty-&s;even millions.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;uch is the infatuation of <HI>Lip&s;ius,</HI> to magnify|ing the extent of Rome, and the number of its inha|bitants, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> that he does not &s;cruple to alter, and fal&s;ify, &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages, in ancient writers, as make again&s;t his chimeras; and blindly follows the mo&s;t ab|&s;urd, and extravagant a&s;&s;ertions of the Greeks, who were remarkable for their flattery to the Romans. Was ever any thing more ridiculous than what the orator, <HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI> &s;ays of Rome, in <HI>Adrian</HI>'s time?

"It is &s;o large, &s;ays this writer, that, in any part of it, a per&s;on may always, with &s;ome rea&s;on, think him&s;elf in the centre of it; &s;o that a whole year is not &s;uf|ficient to enumerate other cities, that are, as it were, included in this cele&s;tial city: whole nations, as Capa|docians, Scythians, and others, having, in number|le&s;s multitudes, at once &s;ettled in Rome." This boa&s;t, however, can relate only to the few quarters, or wards, where &s;ome individuals, of tho&s;e nations, u&s;ed chiefly to live. <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI>'s amphitheatre was about one hundred and fifty feet in height; yet <HI>Ammianus Marcelinus</HI> is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that its height is &s;carce di&s;cernable by human eyes.</P>
<P>Authors, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> differ very much in opinion, with re&s;pect to the number of inhabitants which Rome contained, at the period when it was mo&s;t populous. Some accounts make them &s;even millions, he adds, and others a much greater number. The&s;e &s;eem all to be incredible exaggerations. It is not probable that what is properly called the city of Rome, ever extended beyond the wall built by <HI>Belli&s;arius,</HI> after he had defeat|ed the Goths. This wall has been frequently repaired &s;ince, and is &s;till &s;tanding; it is about thirteen or four|teen miles in circuit, which is nearly the &s;ize that Rome was of, in the days of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian.</HI> Tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert that the number of inhabitants in ancient Rome, when it was mo&s;t populous, could not exceed a million, exclu&s;ive
<PB N="236" REF="243">
of &s;laves, are thought moderate in their calculation; but when we con&s;ider that the circumference, of thirteen or fourteen miles, is not equal to that of either Paris or London; that the <HI>Campus Martius,</HI> which is the be&s;t built part of modern Rome, was a field, without a hou&s;e upon it, anciently; and that the ri&s;ing ground, where St <HI>Peter</HI>'s church and the vatican &s;tand, was no part of old Rome; it will be difficult to conceive that ever Rome could boa&s;t a million of inhabitants. If the wall of <HI>Belli&s;arius</HI> be admitted as the boundary of the ancient city, it is not ea&s;y to imagine that it could have, at any time, contained above five or &s;ix hun|dred thou&s;and, without &s;uppo&s;ing the ma&s;ters of the world to have been the wor&s;t lodged people in it.</P>
<P>But if in the computations above-mentioned the &s;uburbs are included; if tho&s;e who lived without the walls are con&s;idered as inhabitants; in that ca&s;e, there will be room enough for any number, the limits of the &s;uburbs not being a&s;certained.</P>
<P>The buildings immediately without the walls of Rome, which were connectedly continued &s;o as to merit the name of &s;uburbs, were certainly of va&s;t ex|tent; and, with the inhabitants of the town it&s;elf, mu&s;t have contained a prodigious number of people. By a calculation, made by Mr. <HI>Byres,</HI> the <HI>Circus Max|imus</HI> was of &s;ufficient &s;ize to accommodate three hun|dred
<PB N="237" REF="244">
and eighty thou&s;and &s;pectators; and, we are told by the Latin poets, that it was u&s;ually full. Now if allowance be made for the &s;uperannuated, the &s;ick, and the infirm; al&s;o for children, and tho&s;e employed in their private bu&s;ine&s;s, and for &s;laves who were not permitted to remain in the <HI>Circus,</HI> during the games; Mr. <HI>Byres</HI> imagines that &s;uch a number could not be &s;upplied by a city and &s;uburbs, the number of who&s;e inhabitants were much under three millions.</P>
<P>Whatever may have been the extent of the &s;uburbs of Rome, it is probable, they were only formed of or|dinary hou&s;es, and inhabited by people of inferior rank. There are no remains of palaces, or magni|ficent buildings of any kind, to be now &s;een near the walls, or, indeed, over the whole Campagna; yet, it it is a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome authors, that this wide &s;urface was peopled, at one period, like a continued village; and, we are told of &s;trangers, who, viewing this im|men&s;e plain covered with hou&s;es, imagined they had already entered Rome, when they were thirty miles from the walls of that city.</P>
<P>Though this city is thought now not to contain above one hundred and &s;ixty, or &s;eventy thou&s;and in|habitants; a number greatly inferior to what it con|tained in the days of its ancient power; yet this num|ber is greater than it has generally been able to boa&s;t,

&s;ince the fall of the empire. There is good authority for believing, that Rome, at particular periods, &s;ince that time, &s;ome of them not very remote, has been reduced to between thirty and forty thou&s;and inha|bitants. The numbers have gradually increa&s;ed, during the whole of this century. As it was much le&s;s expen&s;ive to purcha&s;e new ground for building upon, than to clear away ruins, which, by time, had acquired the con&s;i&s;tence of rock. Great part of the modern city, is built upon what was the ancient Cam|pus Martius.</P>
<P>The river Tyber divides the city, properly &s;o called, from the <HI>Tran&s;tevere,</HI> or quarter, in which is the church of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and the palace of the Vatican. This river is about three hundred and fifteen feet wide, at the bridge of St. <HI>Angelo,</HI> and is navigable for large barges; the water is yellow and turbid.</P>
<P>Many are of opinion, that, by turning this river out of its channel for a time, va&s;t riches and valuable an|tiquities thrown into it, at different times, when the city has been &s;acked and pillaged; would be found. The water of this river, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> is &s;o thick and foul, that it is not fit for hor&s;es to drink, till it has &s;tood two or three days for the filth to &s;ub&s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="246">There are now three bridges at Rome: that of St. <HI>Angelo,</HI> anciently <HI>Pons Aelius,</HI> leading to the ca&s;tle of St. <HI>Angelo,</HI> is the principal. All the upper part of it is fini&s;hed by <HI>Bernini,</HI> in a good ta&s;te; but the &s;tatues on it are heavy and di&s;agreeable. Ancient Rome had &s;ix bridges. There are &s;ome &s;mall remains of the Sublician bridge, which was only one, when <HI>Horatius Cocles</HI> defended it &s;o valiantly. It was then of wood, but afterwards built of &s;tone by <HI>Lepidus.</HI></P>
<P>The ruins of the triumphal bridge, near S. <HI>Angelo,</HI> is an object that cannot but &s;trike a man of letters. This was the bridge, over which every general march|ed into the city, to whom a triumph was decreed, either for the conque&s;t of a province, or any other &s;ignal victory. From the time of <HI>Romulus,</HI> to that of the emperor <HI>Probus,</HI> there were about three hundred and twenty of the&s;e triumphs There are now only a few remains of the piers. Who can behold this &s;cene, without ruminating on the nature of the human heart, and recollecting to what trials it mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed, in the cour&s;e of &s;o proud, and &s;o flat|tering a proce&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>A traveller, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> on his arrival at Rome, is not much animated by its appearance; the narrowne&s;s of many of the &s;treets, the thinne&s;s of inhabitants, the prodigious quantity of monks and beggars, give

but a gloomy a&s;pect to this renowned city. There are no rich trade&s;men in it, who, by their acqui&s;itions, either ennoble their &s;ons, or marry their daughters into the hou&s;es of princes. All the &s;hops &s;eem empty, and the &s;hopkeepers poor; not one hackney-coach in &s;o large a town; a proof that there is no middle &s;tation, between tho&s;e who always ride, and tho&s;e who always walk. This is the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion; but let the eye be turned from that point of view to the magnificence of their churches; to the venerable remains of anci|ent Rome; to the prodigious collection of pictures, and antique &s;tatues; to the very river, and ground it|&s;elf, formerly the habitation of that people which, from our cradles, we have been taught to admire; and, with a very few grains of enthu&s;ia&s;m, he will be more than delighted.</P>
<P>The magnificence of the Roman emperors, in em|belli&s;hing the city, ro&s;e to &s;uch a height, that they ran&s;acked all the quarries of Egypt for alaba&s;ter, gra|nite, porphyry, and every kind of marble that coun|try afforded; and, though time and Gothic rage mu&s;t have de&s;troyed great quantities, yet &s;uch was the pro|fu&s;ion brought to Rome, that, be&s;ides the infinite num|ber of columns, &s;tatues, va&s;es, and tables &s;till pre|&s;erved entire; one may &s;ee the very po&s;ts in the &s;treets, all of them, without exception, made of gra|nite, alaba&s;ter, or marble; but the mo&s;t &s;tupendous

&s;ight of all, are the mon&s;trous obeli&s;ks, which con&s;i&s;t of only one piece of marble. I meditate on the&s;e objects, &s;ays <HI>Sharpe,</HI> till I am lo&s;t in wonder and con|fu&s;ion. We have no idea of the mechanical powers by which they are dug out of the quarry, and brought from Egypt. We are a&s;toni&s;hed at the enormous &s;ize of the &s;tones at Stonehenge, cannot comprehend by what contrivance they were carried, and laid in that form; but the bigge&s;t of them is &s;mall, when com|pared to the large&s;t obeli&s;k at Rome.</P>
<P>In the beauty and magnificence of the religious buildings and palaces, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> modern Rome, by far, &s;urpa&s;&s;es the ancient; having a multitude of &s;plendid churches, &s;tately palaces, and large hou&s;es. The pari&s;h churches alone amount to eighty, together with upwards of thirty alms-hou&s;es. Mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are of brick, but tho&s;e of the better &s;ort have the doors, windows, and &s;upporters, of free-&s;tone. Above two-thirds of the hou&s;es are the property of the churches, and convents, to which new pur|purcha&s;es are continually annexed. The &s;treets are well paved, and &s;ome of them with brick; but nei|ther kept clean, nor carefully illuminated.</P>
<P>London &s;eems to be the only town, in Europe, where that convenience is rightly under&s;tood, and carried effectually into execution; for at Paris, the
<PB N="242" REF="249">
candles, in their brown gla&s;s lanterns, give but little light whil&s;t they burn; and, being &s;mall, are &s;oon ex|tingui&s;hed. It is a&s;toni&s;hing this evil &s;hould not be reformed, as every night's experience &s;hews how much darkne&s;s invites to the perpetration of &s;hameful, and atrocious deeds. The cardinals are allowed to take flambeaux behind their coaches; all their princes, and people of quality, are forbidden to u&s;e any other light than &s;mall lanterns; of which every footman, behind the coach, carries one.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more magnificent than the entrance into Rome, by the <HI>porta del popolo;</HI> the road is fine, the approach beautiful, and the gate hand&s;ome. The traveller immediately enters a large area, from the farther &s;ide of which he &s;ees the three principal &s;treets of the city, diverging, and flanked by the fronts of two hand&s;ome churches. In the middle is a noble Egyptian obeli&s;k, and a fountain. The numerous gates of the city are by no means hand&s;ome, or orna|mented. The Flaminean gate, or <HI>porta del popolo,</HI> is the be&s;t of them; the out&s;ide by <HI>Buonarotti,</HI> and that next the city by <HI>Bernini.</HI></P>
<P>Some of the principal &s;treets are of con&s;iderable length, and perfectly &s;traight. That called the <HI>Cor&s;o</HI> is mo&s;t frequented. It runs from the Porto del popolo, along the &s;ide of the Campus Martius. Here the no|bility
<PB N="243" REF="250">
di&s;play their equipages during the carnival, and take the air in the evenings, in fine weather. It is, in|deed, the great &s;cene of Roman magnificence and amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>The &s;hops, on each &s;ide, are three or four feet higher than the &s;treet, and there is a path for the con|venience of foot-pa&s;&s;engers, on a level with the &s;hop. The palaces, of which there are &s;everal in this &s;treet, range in a line with the hou&s;es, having no court before them, like the hotels of Paris; and are not &s;hut up from the &s;ight of the citizens, by high and gloomy walls, like Devon&s;hire and Burlington hou&s;es, in Lon|don. Such di&s;mal barricades are more &s;uitable to the un&s;ociable character of a proud baron, in the days of ari&s;tocratic tyranny, than to the ho&s;pitable and be|nevolent di&s;po&s;ition of their pre&s;ent proprietors.</P>
<P>The cor&s;o commences at the fine area, immediately within the Porto del popolo. This gate is built in a noble &s;tile of elegant &s;implicity, from the de&s;ign of <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> executed by <HI>Bernini.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;trada felice, in the higher part of the city, is about a mile and a half in length, from the Trinita del monte, to the church of St. <HI>John Lateran,</HI> on the Pincean hill. This &s;treet runs all in one line, the view, only interrupted by the fine church of St. <HI>Maria Mag|giora.</HI>
<PB N="244" REF="251">
The &s;trada felice is cro&s;&s;ed by another &s;traight &s;treet, called the Strada di Porta Pia, con&s;iderably above a mile in length, terminated at one end by that gate; and, at the other, by four colo&s;&s;al &s;tatues, in white marble, of two hor&s;es led by two men; &s;up|po&s;ed, by &s;ome, to be repre&s;entations of <HI>Alexander</HI> taming Bucephalus; and, according to others, of <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Pollux.</HI> They are placed before the pope's palace, on the Quirinal hill, and have a noble effect.</P>
<P>It would be more difficult to convey an idea of the &s;maller and le&s;s regular &s;treets. We &s;hall, therefore, only ob&s;erve in general, that Rome, at pre&s;ent, ex|hibits a &s;trange mixture of magnificent and intere&s;t|ing, and of common and beggarly objects; the former con&s;i&s;ts of palaces, churches, and fountains; and, above all, of the remains of antiquity. The latter comprehends all the re&s;t of the city.</P>
<P>There are many &s;quares in Rome, the principal or|naments of which are fountains. That in the <HI>Piazza Novana</HI> is the mo&s;t magnificent in the whole world. It is a va&s;t rock, pierced through and through, &s;o as to be divided into four parts, which unite at the top where the obeli&s;k is placed: towards the bottom, of each part of the rock, is &s;eated a colo&s;&s;al figure, repre|&s;enting the principal rivers with their attributes. The fountain of <HI>Paul</HI> V. is in a very bad &s;tyle; but, the
<PB N="245" REF="252">
water is &s;o rapid, as to turn &s;everal mills. It was brought by <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> from the lake of Bracciano, thirty-five miles from Rome, to &s;upply his naumachia; and there are now &s;ome remains of the aqueduct, near the villa <HI>Pam&s;ili.</HI> The <HI>Fontana di Trevi</HI> is a noble fountain. This is the only water which now comes to Rome by an ancient aqueduct; it is chiefly under ground, which is the rea&s;on that it has been &s;o much better pre&s;erved than any other. This is al&s;o the be&s;t water in Rome; and all the lower parts of the city being furni&s;hed from the fountain of Trevi, tho&s;e who prefer good water to good air, live in tho&s;e parts. It was brought from the Sabina, by <HI>Agrippa,</HI> to &s;up|ply the <HI>Campus Martius.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e fountains are the remains of the munifi|cence and indu&s;try of the ancient Romans, who were extremely delicate in the article of water: but, great applau&s;e, however, is al&s;o due to the different popes, who have been at the expence of re&s;toring and re|pairing tho&s;e noble channels of health, plea&s;ure, and convenience. This great plenty of water, neverthele&s;s, has not induced the Romans to be cleanly. Their &s;treets, and even their palaces, are di&s;graced with filth. The noble <HI>Piazza Novana,</HI> though adorned with three or four fountains, one of which, the mo&s;t magnificent, perhaps, that Europe can produce, is, notwith&s;tanding this provi&s;ion, almo&s;t as dirty as We&s;t
<PB N="246" REF="253">
Smithfield, where the cattle are &s;old in London. The corridors, arcades, and even &s;tairca&s;es, belonging to their mo&s;t elegant palaces, are depo&s;itories of na&s;tine&s;s; and, indeed, in &s;ummer, &s;mell as &s;trong as &s;pirits of hart&s;horn. It is highly probable, their ance&s;tors were not much more cleanly. If we con&s;ider that the cities and &s;uburbs of Rome, in the reign of <HI>Claudius,</HI> con|tained about &s;even millions of inhabitants; a number, at lea&s;t, equal to the &s;um total of all the &s;ouls in Eng|land; that great part of ancient Rome was allotted to temples, porticos, ba&s;ilicae, theatres, baths, circu&s;es, public and private walks and gardens; where very few, if any, of this great number lodged; that by far the greater part of the&s;e inhabitants were &s;laves, and did not enjoy the conveniences of life; and, that the u&s;e of linen was &s;carce known; we mu&s;t naturally con|clude, they were &s;trangely crouded together; and that, in general, they were a very frowzy generation. That they were crouded together, appears from the height of their hou&s;es, which the poet <HI>Rutilius</HI> compared to towers made for &s;caling heaven. In order to remedy this inconvenience, <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar</HI> publi&s;hed a decree, that for the future no hou&s;es &s;hould be built above &s;eventy feet high; which, at a moderate computation, might make &s;ix &s;tories. But what &s;eems, beyond all di&s;pute, to prove that the ancients were dirty crea|tures, are the&s;e two particulars. <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> laid a tax upon urine and ordure, on pretence of being at great
<PB N="247" REF="254">
expence in clearing the &s;treets from &s;uch a nui&s;ance; an impo&s;ition which amounted to about fourteen-pence a year, for each individual; and when <HI>Heliogabalus</HI> ordered all the cobwebs of the city, and &s;uburbs, to be collected, they were found to weigh ten thou&s;and pounds. This was intended as a demon&s;tration of the great number of inhabitants; but it was proof of their dirt, rather than of their popularity. To this we may likewi&s;e add the delicate cu&s;tom of taking vomits, at each others hou&s;es, when they were invited to dinner, or &s;upper, that they might prepare their &s;tomach for gormandizing; a bea&s;tly proof of their na&s;tine&s;s, as well as gluttony. <HI>Horace,</HI> in his de&s;cription of the banquet of <HI>Na&s;idenus,</HI> &s;ays, that when the canopy, under which they &s;at, fell down, it brought along with it as much dirt, as is rai&s;ed by a hard gale of wind in dry weather.</P>
<P>I believe, adds <HI>Smollett,</HI> the moderns retain more of the cu&s;toms of the ancient Romans, than is gene|rally imagined. When I fir&s;t &s;aw the infants, at the foundling ho&s;pital in Paris, &s;o &s;wathed with bandages that the very &s;ight of them made my eyes water; I little dreamed that the pre&s;cription of the ancients could be pleaded for this cu&s;tom, equally &s;hocking and ab&s;urd; but, in the capital at Rome, I met with the antique &s;tatue of a child <HI>emaillot&eacute;,</HI> exactly in the &s;ame manner, rolled up, like an Egyptian mummy,

from the feet. The circulation of the blood, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, mu&s;t be ob&s;tructed on the whole &s;urface of the body, and nothing at liberty but the head; which is the only part that ought to be confined. Is it not &s;ur|pri&s;ing that common &s;en&s;e &s;hould not point out, even to the mo&s;t ignorant, that the&s;e bandages mu&s;t heat the tender infant into a fever; mu&s;t hinder the return of the mu&s;cles, and the play of the joints, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to health and nutrition; and that while the refluent blood is ob&s;tructed in the veins, which run on the &s;urface of the body, the arteries, which lie deep, with|out the reach of compre&s;&s;ion, are continually pouring their contents into the head, where the blood meets with no re&s;i&s;tance? The ve&s;&s;els of the brain are natu|rally lax, and the very futures of the &s;kull are yet open. What are the con&s;equences of this cruel &s;waddling? The limbs are wa&s;ted; the joints grow rickety; the brain is compre&s;&s;ed, and a <HI>hydrocephalus,</HI> with a great head, and &s;ore eyes, en&s;ues. This abo|minable cu&s;tom is, perhaps, one great cau&s;e of the bandy legs, diminutive bodies, and large heads, &s;o frequent in the &s;outh of France, and Italy.</P>
<P>I was no le&s;s &s;urprized to find the modern fa&s;hion of curling the hair, borrowed, in a great mea&s;ure, from the coxcombs and coquettes of antiquity. I &s;aw a bu&s;t of <HI>Nero</HI> in the gallery at Florence, the hair repre&s;ented in rows of buckles, like that of a French

petit-maitre, conformable to the picture drawn of him by <HI>Suetonius.</HI> But there is a bu&s;t in the capital of <HI>Ju|lia Pia,</HI> the &s;econd wife of <HI>Septimus Severus,</HI> with a moveable peruke, dre&s;&s;ed exactly in the fa&s;hionable mode, with this difference, that there is no part of it frizzed; nor is there any appearance of pomatum and powder. The&s;e improvements the <HI>beau monde</HI> have borrowed from the natives of the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>In a part of the city, acro&s;s the Tyber, dwelt the Tran&s;tyberini, or Tran&s;teveri, the de&s;cendants, as they call them&s;elves, of the ancient Romans. This people were once called other people of Rome, but intermarry among them&s;elves. Their features are very different from the re&s;t of the inhabitants of Rome; and they are as di&s;tingui&s;hable by their common oaths, as by their other cu&s;toms. A Tran&s;tyberinian will &s;wear by the head of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and the body of <HI>Jove,</HI> when other inhabitants of Rome will &s;wear by the blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and by the &s;everal &s;aints. There is a prince, and &s;everal noblemen, of this fraternity.</P>
<P>Modern Rome does not cover more than one third of the &s;pace within the walls; and tho&s;e parts that were mo&s;t frequented of old, are now entirely aban|doned. From the capital to the column there is no|thing entire, but one or two churches, built with the
<PB N="250" REF="257">
fragments of ancient edifices. You de&s;cend from the capitol between the remaining pillars of two temples, the pede&s;tals, and part of the &s;hafts, &s;unk in the rub|bi&s;h; then, pa&s;&s;ing through the triumphal arch of <HI>Sep|timus Severus,</HI> you proceed along the fort of <HI>Mons Pa|latinus,</HI> quite covered with the ruins of the ancient palace, belonging to the Roman emperors; and, at the foot of it, there are &s;ome beautiful detached pil|lars &s;till &s;tanding. On the left you &s;ee the remains of the <HI>templum pacis,</HI> which &s;eems to have been the large&s;t, and mo&s;t magnificent, of all the temples in Rome. It was built, and dedicated, by the emperor <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian;</HI> who brought into it all the trea&s;ures, and precious ve&s;&s;els, which he found in the temple of Jeru|&s;alem. This temple was likewi&s;e famous for its li|brary, mentioned by <HI>Aulus Gellius.</HI> Fronting you are the noble ruins of that va&s;t amphitheatre, called the Colo&s;&s;aeum, which has been di&s;mantled, and dilapi|dated, by the Gothic popes and princes of Modern Rome, to build and adorn their paltry palaces, Be|hind the amphitheatre, were with the thermae of the &s;ame emperor, <HI>Titus Ve&s;pa&s;ian.</HI> In the &s;ame quarter was the <HI>Circus Maximus;</HI> and the whole &s;pace from hence, on both &s;ides, to the walls of Rome, compre|hending above twice as much ground as the modern city, is almo&s;t covered with the monuments of anti|quity. The mi&s;erable hou&s;es, and even garden walls, of the pea&s;ants in this di&s;trict, are built with the pre|cious
<PB N="251" REF="258">
materials of &s;hafts, and capitals of marble co|lumns, heads, arms, legs, and mutilated trunks of &s;ta|tues. What pity it is that, among all the remains of antiquity, there is not one of their private dwelling hou&s;es exi&s;ting. I &s;hould have been glad, &s;ays <HI>Smollet,</HI> to have known how the &s;enators of Rome were lodged. I want to be better informed touching the <HI>cava oedium, focus,</HI> the <HI>ara deorum penatum,</HI> the <HI>conclavia, trilinica,</HI> and <HI>caenationes;</HI> the <HI>atria,</HI> where the women re&s;ided, and employed them&s;elves in the woollen manufacture; and the <HI>Hy&s;ta,</HI> which were &s;hady walks, between two porticos, where the men exerci&s;ed them&s;elves in win|ter. I am di&s;gu&s;ted by the modern ta&s;te of architec|ture, though I am no judge of the art. The churches, and palaces, of their days, are crouded with petty or|naments, which di&s;tract the eye; and, by breaking into a variety of little parts, de&s;troy the effect of the whole. Every door and window has its &s;eparate ornaments, its moulding, frize, cornice and tympanum; then there is &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of u&s;ele&s;s fe&s;toons, pillars, pila&s;ters, with their architraves, entablatures, and I know not what, that nothing great or uniform remains to fill the view; and we in vain look for that &s;impli|city of grandeur, tho&s;e large ma&s;&s;es of light and &s;ha|dow, and the inexpre&s;&s;ible <HI>tout en&s;emble,</HI> which charac|terizes the edifices of the ancients. A great edifice, to have its full effect, ought to be <HI>i&s;ol&eacute;,</HI> that is, de|tached from all other, with a large &s;pace around it,
<PB N="252" REF="259">
but the palaces of Rome, and indeed of all the other cities of Italy, are &s;o hemmed in, among other mean hou&s;es, that their beauty and magnificence are, in a great mea&s;ure, concealed. Even tho&s;e which face open &s;treets, and piazzas, are clean only in front. The other apartments are darkened by the vicinity of ordinary hou&s;es; and their views confined by dirty, and di&s;agreeable objects. Within the court there is generally a noble colonnade, all around, and an open corridor above; but the &s;tairs are u&s;ually narrow, &s;teep, and high. The want of &s;a&s;h windows, the dullne&s;s of thin &s;mall gla&s;s lozenges, the dirty brick floors, and the crim&s;on hangings, laced with gold, contribute to ca&s;t a gloom on their apartments. I might add to the&s;e cau&s;es, a number of pictures exe|cuted on melancholy &s;ubjects, antique, mutilated &s;ta|tues, bu&s;ts, bas-reliefs, and &s;epulchral &s;tones, with which their rooms are adorned. It mu&s;t be owned, however, that there are &s;ome objections to this general rule. The villa of Cardinal <HI>Alexander Albani</HI> is light, gay, airy; yet the rooms are too &s;mall, and too much decorated with carving and gilding, which is a kind of gingerbread work. The apartments of one of the princes <HI>Borghe&s;e</HI> are furni&s;hed in the Engli&s;h ta&s;te; and, in the palace of the con&s;table <HI>Colonna,</HI> there is a &s;aloon, or gallery; which, for the proportions, lights, furniture and ornaments, is the mo&s;t noble, elegant, and agreeable apartment I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="260">It is diverting, adds <HI>Smollett,</HI> to hear an Italian ex|patiate on the greatne&s;s of modern Rome. He will tell you there are above three hundred palaces in the city; that there is &s;carce a Roman prince, who&s;e re|venue does not exceed two hundred thou&s;and crowns; and that Rome produces, not only the mo&s;t learned men, but al&s;o the mo&s;t refined politicians, in the uni|ver&s;e. To one of them, talking in this &s;train, I re|plied, that in&s;tead of three hundred palaces, the num|ber did not amount to more than four&s;core; that I had been informed, on good authority, there were not &s;ix individuals in Rome, who had &s;o much as forty thou&s;and crowns a year, about &pound;. 10,000. &s;ter|ling; and that to &s;ay their princes were &s;o rich, and their politicians &s;o refined, was, in effect, a &s;evere &s;a|tire upon them, for not employing their wealth, and their talents, for the advantage of their country. I a&s;ked why their cardinals and princes did not invite, and encourage, indu&s;trious people to &s;ettle, and cul|tivate the campagna of Rome, which is a de&s;art? Why they did not rai&s;e a &s;ub&s;cription to drain the mar&s;hes, in the vicinity of the city, and thus melio|rate the air? Why they did not contribute their wealth, and even their political refinements, in aug|menting their forces, by &s;ea and land; in introducing commerce and manufactures, and in giving &s;ome con|&s;equence to their &s;tate, which was no more than a mite in the political &s;tate of Europe?</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="261">The only appearance of a fortification, in this city, is the ca&s;tle of S. Angelo, &s;ituated on the further bank of the Tyber; but this ca&s;tle, which was formerly the <HI>moles Adriani,</HI> could not hold out half-a-day, again&s;t a battery of ten pieces of cannon, properly di|rected. It was an expedient le&s;t to the invention of the modern Romans, to convert an ancient tomb into a citadel. It could only &s;erve as a temporary retreat for the Pope, in times of popular commotion, and on other &s;udden emergencies; as it happened in the ca&s;e of Pope <HI>Clement</HI> VII. when the troops of the emperor took the city by a&s;&s;ault; and this only while he re&s;ided at the Vatican, from whence there is a co|vered gallery, continued to the ca&s;tle. The ca&s;tle of S. Angelo, how ridiculous &s;oever as a fortre&s;s, appears reputable as a noble monument of antiquity; and, though &s;tanding in a low &s;ituation, is one of the fine&s;t objects that &s;trike the eye, for a &s;tranger, ap|proaching Rome.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> St. Peter's&mdash;Pantheon&mdash;and Amphitheatre of Ve&s;pa&s;ian.</HEAD>
<P>THE incomparable church of St. <HI>Peter</HI> is built in the form of a Latin cro&s;s; and the proportion is &s;o exactly ob&s;erved in the length, height, and breadth, that the eye cannot perceive any thing ex|traordinary large, in any of the&s;e dimen&s;ions, although the whole, taken together, is of a very uncommon bulk and extent. For largene&s;s, and beauty, it may be called the metropolitan church, not only of Rome and Italy, but of the whole world. In this place we &s;ee to what an amazing pitch the Romi&s;h church, which is &s;o fond of external pomp and &s;plendor, has within two centuries carried its favourite &s;cheme, <HI>viz.</HI> that of captivating the &s;en&s;es, and in&s;piring the minds of the ignorant with awe, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the clergy. <HI>Fontana,</HI> in his account of this church, computes that, in his time, it had co&s;t above eighty millions of Ro|man crowns; or, about twenty millions &s;terling. In the opinion of many it &s;urpa&s;&s;es, in &s;ize and magni|ficence,
<PB N="256" REF="263">
the fine&s;t monuments of ancient architecture. The Grecian, and Roman temples, were more di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for the elegance of their form, than their mag|nitude. The Pantheon, which was erected to all the gods, is the mo&s;t entire antique temple in Rome. It is &s;aid that <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> to confirm the triumph of modern, over ancient architecture, made the dome of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s of the &s;ame diameter with the pantheon; rai&s;ing the immen&s;e fabric on four pila&s;ters; whereas the whole circle of the rotunda re&s;ts upon the ground. This great arti&s;t was, perhaps, delighted with the idea of being thought as &s;uperior to the ancient architects, as he was con&s;cious of being inferior to &s;ome of the &s;culptors of antiquity.</P>
<P>This church, the mo&s;t wonderful in the world, has a thou&s;and faults, a thou&s;and bad things in &s;culpture, painting, &amp;c. &amp;c. But I pity the man, &s;ays <HI>Sherlock,</HI> who thinks of looking for them; when a fault pre|&s;ents it&s;elf;, let him advance a &s;tep further,&mdash;a &s;ublime beauty expects him.</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas &s;truck me while I was walking in this church. I went thither with a Pole, a Frenchman, and an Engli&s;hman; the Engli&s;hman looked for beau|ties; the Frenchman, for faults; the Pole, for nothing. When we were at the end of the church, "Behold," &s;ays the Frenchman, "that <HI>Charity</HI> of <HI>Bernini,</HI> how
<PB N="257" REF="264">
wretched it is! the air of her head is affected, her fle&s;h is without bone, and &s;he makes frightful faces." "The&s;e remarks appear to me ju&s;t enough," replies the Engli&s;hman, "but look on the other &s;ide of the altar, you will &s;ee one of the fine&s;t pieces of modern &s;culpture; the ju&s;tice of <HI>Guglielmo della porta.</HI>" "You are in the right," &s;ays the Frenchman, (without look|ing at it), "but that child at the foot of the <HI>Charity,</HI> di&s;gu&s;ts me more than its mother." While the Engli&s;h|man continued to prai&s;e the <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> and the French|man to critici&s;e the <HI>Charity;</HI> the Pole looked at the door by which we entered, and &s;aid to me, that "the church was much longer than he imagined."</P>
<P>All who have &s;een St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s in London, may, by an enlargement of its dimen&s;ions, form &s;ome idea of the external appearance of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s. But the re|&s;emblance fails entirely, on comparing them within; St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s being lined, in many parts, with the mo&s;t precious and beautiful marble, adorned with valuable pictures, and all the powers of &s;culpture.</P>
<P>The approach to St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s church, excells that to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s in a &s;till greater proportion, than the former &s;urpa&s;&s;es the latter, either in &s;ize, or in the richne&s;s and beauty of the internal ornaments. A magnificent portico advances on each &s;ide from the front, by which means a &s;quare court is formed immediately before
<PB N="258" REF="265">
the &s;teps which lead into the church. The two por|ticos form two &s;ides of the &s;quare, the third is clo&s;ed by the front of the church, and the fourth is open. A colonnade, four columns deep, commences at the extremities of the porticos; and, embracing in an oval direction, a &s;pace far wider than the &s;quare, forms the mo&s;t magnificent area, that perhaps was &s;een before any building. This oval colonnade is crowned with a balu&s;trade, ornamented by a great number of &s;ta|tues, and con&s;i&s;ts of above three hundred large pillars, forming three &s;eparate walks, which lead to the ad|vanced portico, and from that into the church. In the middle of the immen&s;e area, &s;tands an Egyptian obeli&s;k of granite; and, to the right and left of this, two very beautiful fountains refre&s;h the atmo&s;phere with &s;treams of clear water. The delighted eye glanc|ing over the&s;e &s;plendid objects, would re&s;t with com|plete &s;atisfaction on the &s;tupendous fabric, to which they &s;erve as embelli&s;hments, if the facade of this ce|lebrated church, had been equal in beauty and ele|gance to the re&s;t of the building. But this is by no means the ca&s;e; and every impartial judge mu&s;t ac|knowledge, that the front of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s, is, in tho&s;e particulars, inferior to that of our St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The length of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s, taken on the out&s;ide, is exactly &s;even hundred and thirty feet; the breadth, five hundred and twenty; and the height, from the
<PB N="259" REF="266">
pavement to the top of the cro&s;s, which crowns the cupola, four hundred and fifty. The grand portico, before the entrance, is two hundred and &s;ixteen feet in length, and forty in breadth.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ual to de&s;ire &s;trangers, on their fir&s;t entering this church, to gue&s;s at the &s;ize of the objects, which, on account of the di&s;tance, &s;eems le&s;s than they are in reality. The &s;tatues of the angels in particular, which &s;upport the founts of holy water, when viewed from the door, &s;eem no bigger than children; but, when approached near, they are found to be &s;ix feet high. We make no mi&s;takes, on &s;eeing a living man at the &s;ame di&s;tance, or at a greater; becau&s;e the know|ledge we have of man's real &s;ize precludes the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of our being mi&s;taken, and we make allowance for the diminution which di&s;tance occa&s;ions; but, angels, and other figures in &s;culpture, having no de|termined &s;tandard, but being under the arbitrary will of the &s;tatuary, who gives them the bulk of giants, or dwarfs, as be&s;t &s;uits his purpo&s;e; we do not know what allowance to make; and the eye un-u&s;ed to &s;uch large ma&s;&s;es, is confounded, and incapacitated from form|ing a right judgment of an object &s;ix feet high, or any other dimen&s;ions with which it is not previou&s;ly ac|quainted.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="267">It has been frequently remarked, that the propor|tions of this church are &s;o fine, and the &s;ymmetry of its different parts &s;o exqui&s;ite, that the whole &s;eems con&s;iderably &s;maller than it really is. It was, how|ever, certainly intended to appear a great and &s;ublime object, and to produce admiration from the va&s;tne&s;s of its dimen&s;ions. It &s;hould &s;eem therefore, that any thing which has a tendency to defeat this effect, can|not, with propriety, be called an excellence.</P>
<P>Having noticed St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s church, unque&s;tionably the fine&s;t piece of modern architecture in Rome, we will mention &s;ome of the be&s;t &s;pecimens of the ancient. And fir&s;t, the Pantheon; which, though not the large&s;t of the Roman temples, is the mo&s;t perfect which now remains. The temple of <HI>Jupiter Capitolinus,</HI> and the temple of Peace, if we may tru&s;t to the accounts we have of the fir&s;t, and to the ruins of the &s;econd, were both much larger than the Pantheon. In &s;pite of the depredations which this la&s;t has &s;u&s;tained from Goths, Vandals, and Popes, it &s;till remains a beautiful monu|ment of Roman ta&s;te. The pavilion of the great altar, which &s;tands under the cupola of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s, and the four wreathed pillars of Corinthian bra&s;s which &s;up|port it, were formed out of the &s;poils of the Pan|theon; which, after all, and with the weight of eight hundred years upon its head, has &s;till a probability of outliving its proud rapacious rival. From the round
<PB N="261" REF="268">
form of this temple, it has obtained the name of Ro|tunda. Its height is a hundred and fifty feet, and its diameter nearly the &s;ame. Within, it is divided into eight parts; the gate at which you enter forming one; the other &s;even compartments, if they may be &s;o called, are each of them di&s;tingui&s;hed by two fluted Corin|thian pillars, and as many pila&s;tres of <HI>Giallo Antico.</HI> The capitals and ba&s;es are of white marble; the&s;e &s;up|port a circular entablature. The wall is perpendicu|lar for half the height of the temple; it then &s;lopes for|ward as it a&s;cends, the circumference gradually di|mini&s;hing, till it terminates in an opening of about five and twenty feet in diameter. There are no win|dows; the central opening in the vault admitting a &s;ufficiency of light, has a much finer effect than win|dows could have had. No great inconvenience can happen from this opening. The conical form of the temple prevents the rain from falling near the walls, where the altars now are, and where the &s;tatues of the gods were formerly placed. The rain which falls in the middle, immediately drills through holes, which perforate a large piece of porphyry, that forms the centre of the pavements; the whole of which con&s;i&s;ts of various pieces of marble, agate, and other mate|rials, which have been picked up from the ruins, and now compo&s;e a kind of Mo&s;aic work.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="269">The portico was added by <HI>Marcus Agrippa,</HI> the &s;on-in-law of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> It is &s;upported by &s;ixteen pillows of granite, five feet in diameter, and of a &s;ingle piece each. Upon the frieze in the front is an in|&s;cription in large capitals, &s;ignifying that it was founded by <HI>Marcus Agrippa,</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Lucius,</HI> during his third con&s;ul&s;hip. Some are of opinion, that the Pan|theon is much more ancient than the <HI>Augu&s;tan</HI> age; and that the porticos, which is the only part tho&s;e anti|quarians admit to be the work of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> though beautiful in it&s;elf, does not corre&s;pond with the &s;im|plicity of the temple.</P>
<P>As the Pantheon is the mo&s;t entire, the amphitheatre of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> is the mo&s;t &s;tupendous, monument of an|tiquity in Rome. It was fini&s;hed by his &s;on <HI>Titus,</HI> and obtained the name of <HI>Colo&s;&s;eum,</HI> afterwards cor|rupted into <HI>Coli&s;eum,</HI> from a colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue of <HI>Apollo,</HI> which was placed before it. This va&s;t &s;tructure was built of Tiburtine &s;tone, which is remarkably durable. Had the public buildings, of the ancient Romans, met with no more inveterate enemy than Time, we might, at this day, contemplate the greater number in all their original perfection; they were formed for the admiration of much later ages than the pre&s;ent. This amphitheatre, in particular, might have &s;tood entire for two thou&s;and years to come: for what are the &s;low corro&s;ions of time, in compari&s;on with the
<PB N="263" REF="270">
rapid de&s;truction from barbarians, the zeal of bigots, and the avarice of popes and cardinals? The fir&s;t de|predation, made on this &s;tupendous building, was by the inhabitants of Rome them&s;elves; at that time greater Goths than their conquerors. We are told they applied to <HI>Theodoric,</HI> who&s;e court was then at Ravenna, for liberty to take the &s;tone of this amphi|theatre, for &s;ome public work they were carrying on. The marble cornices, the frieze, and other ornaments of this building, have been carried away, at various times, to adorn palaces; and the &s;tones have been taken to build churches; and, &s;ometimes, to repair the walls of Rome, the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s work of all. For of what importance are walls to a city, without a gar|ri&s;on? About one half of the external circuit &s;till remains; from which, and the ruins of the other parts, a pretty exact idea may be formed of the origi|nal &s;tructure. By a computation made by Mr. <HI>Byres</HI> it could contain eighty five thou&s;and &s;pectators, making a convenient allowance for each. Fourteen chapels are now erected within. This expedient has &s;aved &s;ome of the fine&s;t remains of heathen mag|nificence, from utter de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Our admiration of the Romans is tempered with horror, when we reflect on the u&s;e formerly made of this immen&s;e building, and the dreadful &s;cenes which were acted in the arena; when not only criminals
<PB N="264" REF="271">
condemned to death, but al&s;o pri&s;oners taken in war, were obliged to butcher each other, for the entertain|ment of an inhuman populace. The combats of gla|diators were at fir&s;t u&s;ed at Rome, at funerals only; where pri&s;oners were obliged to a&s;&s;ume that profe&s;&s;ion, and fight before the tombs of decea&s;ed generals, or magi&s;trates, in imitation of the barbarous cu&s;tom of the Greeks, of &s;acrificing captives at the tombs of their heroes.</P>
<P>This horrid magnificence, which at fir&s;t was ex|hibited only on the death of con&s;uls, and men of the highe&s;t di&s;tinction, came, gradually, to be claimed by every citizen, who was &s;ufficiently rich to defray the expence; and as the people's fondne&s;s, for the&s;e com|bats, encrea&s;ed every day, they were no longer con|fined to funeral &s;olemnities; but became cu&s;tomary on days of public rejoicings, and were exhibited, at an amazing expence, by &s;ome generals, after victories. In the progre&s;s of riches, luxury and vice, it became a profe&s;&s;ion in Rome to deal in gladiators. Men, called <HI>Lani&s;tee,</HI> made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to purcha&s;e pri|&s;oners, and &s;laves; to have them in&s;tructed in the u&s;e of the various weapons; and, when any Roman cho&s;e to amu&s;e the people with their favourite &s;how, or to entertain a &s;elect company of his own friends, upon any particular occa&s;ion, he applied to the <HI>Lani&s;tee;</HI> who, for a &s;mall price, furni&s;hed him with as many
<PB N="265" REF="272">
pair of the&s;e unhappy combatants, as he required. They had various names given to them, according to the different manner in which they were armed. To|wards the end of the republic, &s;ome of the rich, and powerful citizens, had great numbers of gladiators of their own, who were daily exerci&s;ed by the <HI>Lani&s;tee;</HI> and always kept ready for fighting, when ordered by their proprietor. Tho&s;e who were often victorious, or had the good fortune to plea&s;e their ma&s;ters, had their liberty granted them; on which they generally quitted the profe&s;&s;ion; though it &s;ometimes happened that tho&s;e who were remarkably &s;kilful, continued it, either from vanity, or poverty, even after they had obtained their freedom; and the applau&s;e, be&s;towed on tho&s;e gladiators, had the effect of inducing men, born free, to chu&s;e this for a profe&s;&s;ion, which they exerci&s;ed for money, till age impaired their &s;trength, and addre&s;s. They then hung up their arms in the temple of <HI>Hercules,</HI> and appeared no more on the arena.</P>
<P>There were many amphitheatres at Rome, as well as in other towns of Italy, and in many provinces of the empire; but this of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> was the large&s;t that ever was built. That of Verma is the next in &s;ize, in Italy; and the remains of the amphitheatre at Ni&s;mes prove, that it was the mo&s;t magnificent &s;tructure, of this kind, in any of the Roman provinces. The
<PB N="266" REF="273">
Romans were &s;o exce&s;&s;ively fond of the&s;e exhibitions, that where colonies were e&s;tabli&s;hed, it was found ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give public &s;hews of this kind, to induce the emigrants to remain in their new country; and, in the provinces in which it was thought nece&s;&s;ary, that a con&s;iderable body of troops &s;hould remain con|&s;tantly; &s;tructures of this kind were erected at va&s;t la|bour and expence, and were found the be&s;t means of inducing the young officers to &s;ubmit chearfully, to a long ab&s;ence from the capital, and preventing the common &s;oldiers from de&s;ertion. The profu&s;ion of human blood, which was &s;hed in the arena, by the cruel prodigality of the emperors, and the refinements which were invented, to augment the barbarous plea|&s;ure of the &s;pectators, are proofs of the dreadful cor|ruption and depravity, to which human nature is ca|pable of attaining, even among a learned and en|lightened people, when unre&s;trained by the mild pre|cepts of a benevolent religion. We are told that the gladiators bred for the u&s;e of particular patricians, as well as tho&s;e kept for hire by the <HI>Lani&s;tee,</HI> were, for &s;ome weeks, before they appeared in the arena, fed upon &s;uch &s;ucculent diet, as would &s;oone&s;t fill their veins, that they might bleed freely at every wound. They were in&s;tructed by the <HI>Lani&s;tee,</HI> not only in the art of fighting, but al&s;o in the mo&s;t graceful manner of dying; and, when the&s;e wretched men felt them|&s;elves mortally wounded, they a&s;&s;umed &s;uch attitudes,
<PB N="267" REF="274">
as they knew plea&s;ed the beholders; and, they &s;eemed to receive plea&s;ure them&s;elves, from the applau&s;e be&s;towed upon them in their la&s;t moments.</P>
<P>When a gladiator was thrown by his antagoni&s;t to the ground, and directly laid down his arms, it was a &s;ign that he could re&s;i&s;t no longer, and declared him|&s;elf vanqui&s;hed, but &s;till his life depended on the &s;pec|tators. If they were plea&s;ed with his performance, or in a merciful di&s;po&s;ition, they held up their hands, with the thumb folded down, and the life of the man was &s;pared; but, if they were in the humour to &s;ee him die, they held up the hand clenched, with thumb only erect. As &s;oon as the pro&s;trate victim beheld that fatal &s;ignal, he knew all hopes of life were vain, and immediately pre&s;ented his brea&s;t to the &s;word of his adver&s;ary; who, whatever his own inclinations might be, was obliged to put him to death in&s;tantly.</P>
<P>As the&s;e combats formed the &s;upreme plea&s;ure of the inhabitants of Rome, the mo&s;t cruel of their em|perors were &s;ometimes the mo&s;t popular; merely, becau&s;e they gratified the people, without re&s;traint, in their favourite amu&s;ement. When <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> thought it nece&s;&s;ary, for the public &s;ervice, to recruit his army from the gladiators of Rome; it rai&s;ed more di&s;content among the populace, than many of the wilde&s;t pranks of <HI>Caligula.</HI> In the times of &s;ome of
<PB N="268" REF="275">
the Roman emperors, the lower cla&s;s of Roman citi|zens were certainly as worthle&s;s a &s;et of men as ever exi&s;ted; &s;tained with all the vices which ari&s;e from idlene&s;s and dependance; living upon the large&s;&s;es of the great; pa&s;&s;ing their whole time in the circus and amphitheatres, where every &s;entiment of humanity was annihilated within their brea&s;ts, and where the agonies and torments of their fellow-creatures were their chief pa&s;time. That no occa&s;ion might be lo&s;t, of indulging this &s;avage ta&s;te of the populace, criminals were condemned to &s;ight with wild bea&s;ts, in the arena, or were expo&s;ed, unarmed, to be torn in pieces by them; and other times they were blindfolded; and, in that condition, obliged to cut and &s;laughter each other. So that, in&s;tead of victims &s;olemnly &s;acrificed to pub|lic ju&s;tice, they &s;eemed to be brought in as buffoons, to rai&s;e the mirth of the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we expre&s;s horror and indignation at the fondne&s;s, which the Romans di&s;played for the com|bats of the amphitheatres, let us reflect whether this proceeded from any cruelty of di&s;po&s;ition, inherent in that people, or belongs to mankind in general; let us reflect, whether it is probable, that the people of any other nation would be gradually led, by the &s;ame degrees, to an equal pa&s;&s;ion for &s;uch horrid entertain|ments: let us con&s;ider whether there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that tho&s;e who arm cocks with &s;teel, and take
<PB N="269" REF="276">
plea&s;ure in beholding the &s;pirited little animals cut one another to death, would not take the &s;ame, or &s;u|perior delight, in obliging men to &s;laughter each other, if they had the power. It is not long &s;ince that box|ing, cudgelling, and fighting with the broad &s;word, was introduced into London; and prize-fighters were found, who would cut and fla&s;h each other for the amu&s;ement of the &s;pectators. And what re&s;trains the continuance, but benevolent laws? Is there no rea&s;on to believe, that the influence of a purer religion, and brighter example, than were known to the heathen world, prevents mankind from tho&s;e enormities, at this time, which were countenanced formerly? As &s;oon as the benevolent principles of chri&s;tianity were received by the Romans, as the laws of the Deity, the pri&s;oners, and the &s;laves, were treated with huma|nity; and the bloody exhibitions in the amphitheatre were aboli&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Forum Romanum&mdash;Triumphal Arches&mdash;Tarpeian Rock. Trajan's Pillar, and other Remains of Antiquity.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the back view of the capitol is beheld the <HI>Forum Romanum,</HI> now exhibiting a melancholy, but intere&s;ting view of the deva&s;tation wrought by the united force of time, avarice and bigotry. The fir&s;t objects which meet the eye, on this &s;ide of the hill, are three fine pillars, two-thirds of them buried in the ruins of the old capitol. They are &s;aid to be the re|mains of the temple of <HI>Jupiter Tonans,</HI> built by <HI>Au|gu&s;tus,</HI> in gratitude for having e&s;caped death, from a &s;troke of lightning. Near the&s;e are the remains of <HI>Jupiter Stator;</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of three very elegant &s;mall Corinthian pillars, with their entablature; the temple of Concord, where <HI>Cicero</HI> a&s;&s;embled the &s;enate, on the di&s;covery of <HI>Cataline</HI>'s con&s;piracy; the temple of <HI>Ro|mulus</HI> and <HI>Remus,</HI> and that of <HI>Antoninus</HI> and <HI>Fau&s;tina,</HI> ju&s;t by it, both converted into modern churches; the
<PB N="271" REF="278">
ruins of the magnificent temple of Peace, built im|mediately after the taking of Jeru&s;alem, the Roman empire being then in profound peace. This is &s;aid to have been the fine&s;t temple in Old Rome; part of the materials of <HI>Nero</HI>'s golden hor&s;e, which <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> pulled down, were u&s;ed in erecting this grand edifice. The only entire pillar remaining, of this temple, was placed, by <HI>Paul</HI> V. before the church of <HI>Santa Maria Maggiore.</HI> It is a mo&s;t beautiful fluted Corinthian column, and gives a very high idea of the temple, to which it originally belonged. His holine&s;s has crowned it with an image of the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> and, in the in&s;cription on the pede&s;tal, he gives his rea&s;on for choo&s;ing a column belonging to the temple of Peace, as an ornament to a church dedicated to the virgin.</P>

<P>Of many triumphal arches, which formerly &s;tood in Rome, there are only three now remaining, all near the capitol, and forming entrances to the Forum; tho&s;e of <HI>Titus, Septimus Severus,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantine.</HI> The la&s;t is by much the fine&s;t of the three; but its chief beauties are not genuine; nor, properly &s;peak|ing, its own; they con&s;i&s;t of &s;ome admirable bas-reliefs,
<PB N="272" REF="279">
&s;tolen from the Forum of <HI>Trajan,</HI> and repre|&s;enting that emperor's victories over the Dacians. This theft might, perhaps, not have been &s;o notorious to po&s;terity, if the arti&s;ts of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI>'s time had not added &s;ome figures which make the fraud apparent; and, by their great inferiority, evince the degeneracy of the art, in the interval between the reign of the&s;e two emperors.</P>
<P>The bas-reliefs of the arch of <HI>Titus</HI> repre&s;ent the table of &s;hew-bread, the trumpets, the golden candle-&s;ticks, with &s;even branches, and other uten&s;ils brought from the temple of Jeru&s;alem. The quarter which is allotted for the Jews is not at a great di&s;tance from this arch. There are about nine thou&s;and of that un|fortunate nation at pre&s;ent in Rome; the lineal de|&s;cendants of tho&s;e brought captive, by <HI>Titus,</HI> from Jeru&s;alem. A &s;triking in&s;tance of &s;en&s;ibility in this people is, that they ever cautiou&s;ly avoid pa&s;&s;ing through this arch, though it is directly in their way to the Campo Vaccino, chu&s;ing rather to make a cir|cuit, and enter the forum at another place.</P>
<P>There are many other intere&s;ting ruins in and about the Campo Vaccino, but of &s;ome &s;tructures which we know formerly &s;tood here, no ve&s;tige is now to be &s;een. This is the ca&s;e with the arch which was erected in honour of the Fabian family. There is the &s;tronge&s;t
<PB N="273" REF="280">
rea&s;on to believe, that the ancient forum was en|tirely &s;urrounded with temples; ba&s;ilicae, and public buildings of various kinds, and adorned with por|ticos and colonades. In the time of the republic a&s;|&s;emblies of the people were held there, laws pro|po&s;ed, and ju&s;tice admini&s;tered. In it was the ro&s;|trum from whence the orators harangued the people. All, who a&s;pired at dignities, came hither to canva&s;s &s;uffrages. The bankers had their office near the forum, as well as tho&s;e who received the revenues of the commonwealth; and all kind of bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted in this place.</P>
<P>The Tarpeian rock is a continuation of that on which the capitol was built; I went to that part, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> from which criminals condemned to death were thrown. M. <HI>Byres</HI> has mea&s;ured the height; it is exactly fifty-eight feet perpendicular; and, he thinks the ground at the bottom, from evident marks, is twenty feet higher than it was originally; &s;o that, before, this accumulation of rubbi&s;h, the precipice mu&s;t have been eighty feet perpendicular. In reading the hi&s;tory of the Romans, the va&s;t idea we form of that people naturally extends to the city of Rome; the hills on which it was built, and every thing belong|ing to it. We imagine the Tarpeian rock as a tre|mendous precipice; and, if afterwards we ever have an opportunity of actually &s;eeing it, the height falls &s;o
<PB N="274" REF="281">
&s;hort of our expectations, that we are apt to believe it a great deal le&s;s than it is in reality. A mi&s;take of this kind, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> has led bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI> into the &s;trange a&s;&s;ertion, that the Tarpeian rock is &s;o very low, that a man would think it no great matter to leap down it for his diver&s;ion. Criminals, thrown from this precipice, were literally thrown out of the city of old Rome, into the Campus Martius, which was a large plain, of a triangular &s;hape; two &s;ides of the triangle being formed by the Tyber, and the ba&s;e by the capitol, and by buildings extending three miles nearly in a parallel line with it. The Campus Mar|tius had its name from a &s;mall temple, built in it, at a very early period and dedicated to <HI>Mars;</HI> or it might have this name from the military exerci&s;es performed there. In this field, the great a&s;&s;emblies of the peo|ple, called <HI>cen&s;us,</HI> or <HI>lu&s;trum,</HI> were held every fifth year; the con&s;uls, cen&s;ors, and tribunes were elected; the levies of troops were made; and there the Roman youth exerci&s;ed them&s;elves in riding, driving the cha|riot, &s;hooting with the bow, u&s;ing the &s;ling, darting the javelin, throwing the di&s;cus or quoit, in wre&s;tling or running; and, when covered with &s;weat and du&s;t, in con&s;equence of the&s;e exerci&s;es, they wa&s;hed their bodies clean by &s;wimming in the Tiber.</P>
<P>The dead bodies, of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious citizens, were al&s;o burnt in this field, which was adorned gra|dually
<PB N="275" REF="282">
by &s;tatues and trophies, erected to the memory of di&s;tingui&s;hed men. But every feature of its an|cient appearance is now hid, by the &s;treets and build|ings of modern Rome.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of modern Rome may be excu&s;ed in chu&s;ing this &s;ituation for their hou&s;es; though, by &s;o doing, they have deprived us of a view of the Campus Martius. But, &s;urely they ought to &s;hew more &s;oli|citude for pre&s;erving the antiquities than they do; and they might, without inconvenience, find &s;ome place for a cow-market, of le&s;s importance than the ancient Forum. It is not in their power to re&s;tore it to its former &s;plendor; but they might, at lea&s;t, have prevented its falling back to the &s;tate in which <HI>Aeneas</HI> found it, when he went to vi&s;it the poor <HI>Evander.</HI></P>
<P>As Rome increa&s;ed in &s;ize, and number of inha|bitants, one Forum was found too &s;mall, and many others were erected in proce&s;s of time; but, when we, &s;peak of the Forum, without any di&s;tingui&s;hing epithet, the ancient one is under&s;tood. In the&s;e <HI>Ba&s;ilicae</HI> were built, ju&s;tice admini&s;tered, and bu&s;ine&s;s likewi&s;e tran&s;|acted. The emperors were fond of having &s;uch places named after them. The accounts we have of the Forums of <HI>Nerva,</HI> and that of <HI>Trajan,</HI> give the highe&s;t idea of their grandeur and elegance; three Corin|thian pillars, with their entablature, are all that re|main
<PB N="276" REF="283">
of the former; of the latter, the noble column, placed in the middle, &s;till pre&s;erves all its original beauty. It con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-three circular pieces of white marble, horizontally placed one above the other; it is about twelve feet diameter at the bottom, and ten at the top. The plinth of the ba&s;e is a piece of marble twenty-one feet &s;quare. A &s;tairca&s;e, con|&s;i&s;ting of one hundred and eighty-three &s;teps, and &s;uf|ficiently wide to admit a per&s;on to a&s;cend, is cut out of the &s;olid marble, leaving a &s;mall pillar in the middle, round which the &s;tairs wind, from the bottom to the top. The &s;tairs are lighted by forty-one windows, exceedingly narrow on the out&s;ide, that they might not interrupt the connection of the bas-reliefs, but which gradually widen within, and by that means give &s;ufficient light. The mo&s;t remarkable events of <HI>Tra|jan</HI>'s expedition again&s;t the Dacians, are admirably wrought in a continued &s;piral line, from the bottom of the column to the top. The figures, towards the top, are too far removed from the eye to be &s;een perfectly. Viewed from any con&s;iderable di&s;tance, all the &s;culp|ture is lo&s;t; and a plain fluted pillar, of the &s;ame pro|portions, would have had as fine an effect. But &s;uch a frugal plan would not have been &s;o glorious to the prince, who&s;e victories are engraven; or &s;o intere&s;t|ing to the legionary &s;oldiers, many of whom, no doubt, are here per&s;onally repre&s;ented.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="284">Exclu&s;ive of the &s;tatue, this beautiful pillar is one hundred and twenty feet high. The a&s;hes of <HI>Trajan</HI> were depo&s;ited in an urn at the bottom, and his &s;tatue at the top. Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> V. in the room of <HI>Trajan,</HI> has placed a &s;tatue of St. <HI>Peter</HI> upon this column. I ob|&s;erved, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> to a gentleman with whom I vi&s;ited this pillar, that there did not &s;eem to be much pro|priety in placing the figure of St. <HI>Peter</HI> upon a mo|nument repre&s;enting the victories, and erected in honour of the emperor <HI>Trajan.</HI> "There is &s;ome pro|priety, however," replied he, "in having made the &s;tatue of <HI>bra&s;s.</HI>"</P>
<P>Among&s;t other ruins, of this once imperial mi&s;tre&s;s of the world, <HI>Caracalla</HI>'s baths are in high e&s;timation, with all the lovers of antiquity. They appear to oc|cupy as much ground as a moderate &s;ized town; and, not only afforded conveniences for near three thou&s;and per&s;ons to bathe at one time, without being &s;een by each other, together with &s;quares and courts for all kinds of &s;ports and other public &s;pectacles; but even &s;cience found a place in the circumference of the&s;e baths. There were porticos for philo&s;ophers to a&s;|&s;emble in. The whole adorned with a profu&s;ion of &s;tatues, and the mo&s;t precious ornaments luxury could find or invent. What, alas remains! Nothing but broken walls and naked bricks; yet, even the&s;e la&s;t ate fine in their way, as none can be formed at this
<PB N="278" REF="285">
day of &s;o large a &s;ize; they are al&s;o of an extraor|dinary texture and colour. The pipes, which con|veyed the water to a prodigious height into the upper apartments, are made of as fine clay as the old red china, and equally &s;mooth. One part of this immen&s;e building remains &s;ufficiently entire, to &s;trike awe into the &s;pectator; it con&s;i&s;ts of a prodigious dome, which has no &s;upport but from the wall, whence it &s;prings; and, like an unfini&s;hed rainbow, &s;eems &s;u&s;pended in the air. Clo&s;e to the&s;e baths, &s;tood <HI>Caracalla</HI>'s mag|nificent palace; but of this there is not the lea&s;t ve&s;tige remaining.</P>
<P><HI>Diocle&s;ian</HI>'s baths were twelve hundred feet &s;quare, and yet not &s;o large as tho&s;e of <HI>Caracalla.</HI> They oc|cupied all the gardens of the Carthu&s;ian convent, the public granaries, the great &s;quare before them, and the church of St. <HI>Bernardo,</HI> which is circular and antique. A great part of the&s;e <HI>thermae</HI> is converted into a church. The remains of tho&s;e of <HI>Titus</HI> are immen&s;e vaults, and corridors under ground, painted with arabe&s;ques; from which it is &s;aid, <HI>Raphael</HI> took the idea of his paintings, in the <HI>loggie</HI> of the va|tican.</P>
<P>The <HI>therma Diocle&s;ianoe,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Smollett,</HI> might be termed an augu&s;t academy, for the u&s;e and in&s;truction of the Roman people. The Pinacotheca, of this build|ing,
<PB N="279" REF="286">
was a complete mu&s;eum of all the curio&s;ities of art and nature; and there were public &s;chools for all the &s;ciences. They were adorned with all the charms of painting, &s;culpture, and architecture. The pipes for conveying the water were of &s;ilver. Many of the lavaera were of precious marble, illuminated by lamps of chry&s;tal. Among the &s;tatues were found, the famous <HI>Toro</HI> and <HI>Hercules Farne&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Bathing was certainly nece&s;&s;ary to health and clean|line&s;s, in a hot country like Italy, e&s;pecially before the u&s;e of linen was known; but the&s;e purpo&s;es would have been much better an&s;wered by plunging into the Tyber, than by u&s;ing the warm bath in the thermae, which became altogether a point of luxury, borrowed from the effeminate A&s;iatics, and tended to debilitate the fibres, already too much relaxed by the heat of the climate. True it is, they had baths of cold water for the &s;ummer; but, in general, they u&s;ed them milk-warm, and often perfumed: they likewi&s;e indulged in vapour baths, in order to enjoy a plea&s;ing relaxation, which they improved with odoriferous ointments. Of the&s;e baths &s;ome were mercenary, and &s;ome opened gratis. When <HI>Marcus Agrippa</HI> was Aedile, he opened one hundred and twenty private baths, for the u&s;e of the people. In the public baths, where money was taken, each per&s;on paid a quadrans, about the value of our halfpenny. But after the hour of bathing was
<PB N="280" REF="287">
pa&s;t, <HI>centumque petuntur quadrantes,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Martial,</HI> a hun|dred quadrans were demanded.</P>
<P>Though there was no di&s;tinction in the places, be|tween the fir&s;t patrician, and the lowe&s;t plebeian, yet the nobility u&s;ed their &s;ilver and gold plate for wa&s;h|ing, eating, and drinking in the baths, together with towels of the fine&s;t linen. They likewi&s;e made u&s;e of the in&s;trument called &s;trigil, a kind of fle&s;h-bru&s;h.</P>
<P>The circi and naumachia, if con&s;idered as buildings and artificial ba&s;ons, are admirable; but, if examined as arcae, intended for hor&s;e and chariot races, and arti|ficial &s;eas for exhibiting naval engagements, they &s;eem to prove, that the ancient Romans were but indiffe|rently &s;killed and exerci&s;ed, either in hor&s;eman&s;hip, or naval engagements. The inclo&s;ure of the emperor <HI>Caracalla</HI>'s circus is &s;till &s;tanding, and &s;carce affords breathing room for an Engli&s;h hunter. The Circus Maximus, by far the large&s;t in Rome, was not &s;o long as the Mall; and St. James's park would make a much more ample and convenient &s;cene for tho&s;e diver&s;ions, This circus was but three hundred yards in breadth, and a great part of it was taken up by <HI>&s;pina,</HI> or middle &s;pace, adorned with temples, and two great obeli&s;ks; as well as by the canal made by the order of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> to contain crocodiles, and other aqua|tic animals, which were killed occa&s;ionally. This
<PB N="281" REF="288">
canal was &s;o large, that <HI>Heliogabalus,</HI> having filled it with excellent wine, exhibited naval engagements in it for the amu&s;ement of the people. It &s;urrounded three &s;ides of the &s;quare, &s;o that the whole extent of the race did not much exceed an Engli&s;h mile; and, when <HI>Probus</HI> was at the expence of filling the plain of it with fir-trees, to form a wood, for the chace of wild bea&s;ts, this fore&s;t was &s;carce more exten&s;ive than the plantation in St. James's park, on the South &s;ide of the canals.</P>
<P>The Roman emperors &s;eemed more di&s;po&s;ed to ele|vate and &s;urpri&s;e, than to conduct the public diver|&s;ions, according to the rules of rea&s;on and propriety. One would imagine it was with that view, they in&s;ti|tuted their naumachia, or naval engagements, per|formed by half a dozen &s;mall gallies of a &s;ide, in an artificial ba&s;on of fre&s;h water. The&s;e gallies were not &s;o large as fi&s;hing &s;macks, for they were moved by two, three, and four oars on a &s;ide, according to their different rates, <HI>biremes, triremes,</HI> and <HI>quadriremes.</HI> Some antiquarians, indeed, believe the Roman gallies had different tires, or decks of oars; but this notion is quite contrary to all the figures of them, pre&s;erved on ancient coins and medals. <HI>Suetonius,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Domitian,</HI> &s;peaks of this emperor giving a mock &s;ea-engagement, in a lake formed on purpo&s;e, in the Tyber; the ve&s;&s;els of which were nearly large enough
<PB N="282" REF="289">
for actual &s;ervice. Yet, this artificial lake was not larger than the piece of water in Hyde-park. How would it &s;ound in the ears of a Briti&s;h &s;ailor, that a mock engagement, between two &s;quadrons of men of war, would be exhibited on &s;uch a day, on the Serpen|tine river! Or that the &s;hips of the line, taken from the enemy, would be carried in proce&s;&s;ion, from Hyde|park corner to Tower wharf. Certain it is, that <HI>Lu|callus,</HI> in one of his triumphs, had one hundred and ten &s;hips of war carried through the &s;treets of Rome. Nothing can give a more contemptible idea of their naval power, than this te&s;timony of their hi&s;torians, that their &s;eamen were formed by exerci&s;ing &s;mall row-boats, in an enclo&s;ed pool of fre&s;h water. Half-a-dozen Engli&s;h frigates, one may venture to affirm, would have been able to defeat both the contending fleets at the battle of Actium, which has been &s;o much celebrated in the annals of antiquity, as an event that decided the fate of empire.</P>
<P>The common &s;ewers were fir&s;t made by order of <HI>Tarquinius Pri&s;cus,</HI> not &s;o much with a view to clean|line&s;s, as for &s;ubterranean drains to the Vilabrum, which was mar&s;hy; and, in order to carry off the &s;tagnant water, which remained in the lower parts, after heavy rains. The different branches of their channels united at the Forum, from whence by the <HI>Cloaca maxima,</HI> their contents were conveyed into the
<PB N="267" REF="290">
Tyber. This great <HI>cloaca,</HI> was the work of <HI>Tarquinius Superbus.</HI> Other &s;ewers were added by <HI>M. Cato,</HI> and <HI>V. Flaccus,</HI> cen&s;ors. All the&s;e drains, having been choaked up and become ruinous, were cleared and re&s;tored by <HI>M. Agrippa,</HI> who likewi&s;e undermined the whole city with canals of the &s;ame kind, for carrying off the filth; he &s;trengthened and enlarged the <HI>cloaca maxima,</HI> &s;o as to make it capable of receiving a large cart loaded with hay, and directed &s;even &s;treams of water into the&s;e &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages, in order to keep them always clean and open. If, notwith&s;tand|ing all their conveniences, <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> was put to great expences in removing the ordure from the public &s;treets; we may fairly conclude, that the ancient Romans were not more cleanly than the modern Italians.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have real plea&s;ure in contemplating the remains of antique, and the noble&s;t &s;pecimens of modern, architecture, and who have an unwearied ad|miration of the charms of painting, may employ a full year with &s;atisfaction in this city.</P>
<P>What is called a regular cour&s;e with an antiquarian, generally takes up about &s;ix weeks; employing three hours a day; in that time, every thing worth &s;eeing, in or near Rome, may be vi&s;ited. But, after having
<PB N="284" REF="291">
made this cour&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> however di&s;tinctly every thing may have been explained by the antiquarian, if the traveller does not vi&s;it the mo&s;t intere&s;ting again and again, and reflect on them at more lei&s;ure, his la|bour will be of little u&s;e; for the objects are &s;o va|rious, and tho&s;e &s;een one day, &s;o apt to be effaced or confounded with, tho&s;e beheld on another, that he mu&s;t carry away a very faint and indi&s;tinct recollec|tion of any. Many travellers have experienced the truth of this ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>One young gentleman, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> who happened not to be violently &s;mitten with the charms of <HI>virt&ugrave;,</HI> and &s;corned to affect what he did not feel, thought that two or three hours a day, were rather too much time to be&s;tow on a pur&s;uit in which he felt no plea|&s;ure, and &s;aw little utility. The only advantage which, in his opinion, the greate&s;t part of us reaped from our &s;ix weeks tour, was, that we could &s;ay we had &s;een a great many fine things, which he had not &s;een. This was a &s;uperiority he could not brook, and which he re&s;olved we &s;hould not long enjoy. Being fully con|vinced the bu&s;ine&s;s might, with a little exertion, be di&s;patched in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, he prevailed on a proper per&s;on to attend him; ordered a po&s;t chai&s;e and four hor&s;es to be ready early in the morning; and, driving through churches, palaces, villas, and ruins, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, he fairly &s;aw in
<PB N="285" REF="292">
two days, all that we had beheld during our crawling cour&s;e of &s;ix weeks. I found afterwards, by the li&s;t he kept of what he had &s;een, that we had not the ad|vantage of him in a &s;ingle picture, or the mo&s;t mu|tilated remnant of a &s;tatue.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e travellers who cannot remain a con&s;iderable time at Rome, would do well to get a judicious li&s;t of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting objects in architecture, &s;culpture, and painting; the&s;e they ought to vi&s;it frequently, and the&s;e only, by which means they will acquire a &s;trong and di&s;tinct impre&s;&s;ion of what they have &s;een; in&s;tead of that tran&s;ient and confu&s;ed idea which a va&s;t number of things viewed &s;uperficially, leave in the mind.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Papal and other Palaces, with their Antique Statues, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Pope has three &s;uperb palaces; that of the Campidaglio, or ancient capitol; the palace of the Vatican; and that of the Monte Cavallo.</P>
<P>The approach to the modern Campidaglio is very noble, and worthy of the genius of <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> who was the architect. This building is rai&s;ed on part of the ruins of the ancient capitol, and fronts St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s church, with its back to the Forum and old Rome. There are very little remains of the old capitol, or temple of <HI>Jupiter Capitolinus,</HI> yet enough to make a Chri&s;tian church. It had the denomina|tion of <HI>Capitolinus,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Livy,</HI> from the head of a man, ca&s;ually found here, in digging for the foundations of the famous temple of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> The capitol was the effect of a vow, made by <HI>Tarquinius Pri&s;cus,</HI> in the Sabine war. The &s;tructure &s;tood on a high ridge,
<PB N="287" REF="294">
taking in four acres of ground. This temple was fir&s;t con&s;umed by fire in the Marian war, and then rebuilt by <HI>Scylla.</HI> This too was demoli&s;hed in the <HI>Vitellian</HI> &s;edition. <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> undertook a third, which was burnt down about the time of his death. <HI>Domitian</HI> rai&s;ed the la&s;t and mo&s;t glorious of them all, in which the very gilding amounted to two millions and a quar|ter &s;terling; which immen&s;e expenditure, in that &s;ingle article, gave <HI>Plutarch</HI> occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that he was like <HI>Midas,</HI> de&s;irous of turning every thing into gold.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent building was erected in the pontificate of <HI>Gregory</HI> XIII. It is a large and magnificent pa|lace, with two &s;pacious wings, containing very grand apartments. At the bottom of the &s;tairs are two Egyptian lions, which form two fountains; and, at the top, &s;tand <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Pollux,</HI> holding their hor&s;es, both colo&s;&s;al, in white marble, and repre&s;enting tho&s;e heroes as they came expre&s;s to Rome, with the news of the victory gained over the Tarquins. The&s;e two lions are, by &s;ome writers, called Sphinxes; &s;o little is the dependance that can be put on the relation of travellers.</P>
<P>The two &s;phinxes of Ba&s;alte, at the bottom of the a&s;cent, though excellent &s;pecimens of Egyptian &s;culpture, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> engage little your attention.
<PB N="288" REF="295">
Warm with the glory of Rome, you cannot be&s;tow a thought on the hieroglyphics of Egypt. On the other hand, <HI>Northall</HI> has an expre&s;s note on this &s;ubject, and quotes two other authors in &s;upport of his a&s;&s;er|tion, that they are lions. So very contradictory in their te&s;timony in this particular.</P>
<P>In the centre of the area, fronting the city, &s;tands the famous eque&s;trian bronze &s;tatue, of the Roman emperor <HI>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Pius,</HI> which was erected to him by the &s;enate and people of Rome. From this exalted &s;tation, the emperor &s;eems to take a &s;urvey of the city; and, with his hand extended, to be now giving laws to Rome. It is e&s;teemed the fine&s;t &s;tatue in the world, and was anciently in very high repute. The Romans boa&s;t much of this &s;tatue at pre&s;ent; and &s;ay, the Venetians offered as many &s;equins of gold for it, as could be inclo&s;ed in the belly of the hor&s;e, which was refu&s;ed. What <HI>Carlo Maratti</HI> is reported to have &s;aid to the hor&s;e, may give &s;ome idea of the excellence of the &s;culpture. <HI>Why do&s;t thou not walk? Ha&s;t thou forgot that thou art alive?</HI></P>
<P>At the upper end of the area, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> the eye is caught by a maje&s;tic female figure, in a &s;itting at|titude, which, we are told, is a <HI>Roma triumphans,</HI> brought from Cori, one of the olde&s;t towns of La|tium. We view her, &s;ays the above writer, with all
<PB N="289" REF="296">
the warmth of fond enthu&s;ia&s;m, but we recollect &s;he is no longer triumphant; we ca&s;t an indignant eye on St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s, to which &s;he al&s;o &s;eems to look with indig|nation. Is there &s;uch another in&s;tance of the vici&s;|&s;itudes of human things; the proud mi&s;tre&s;s of the world under the dominion of a prie&s;t?</P>
<P>In the two wings of this modern palace, called the Campidaglio, the con&s;ervators of the city have apart|ments; their office is analagous to that of the ancient Aediles. In the main body, an Italian nobleman, ap|pointed by the Pope, has his re&s;idence, with the title of Senator of Rome; the mi&s;erable repre&s;entation of that &s;enate, which gave laws to the world. The mo&s;t defaced ruin, the mo&s;t &s;hapele&s;s heap of antique rub|bi&s;h in all Rome, cannot convey a feebler image of the building, to which they belonged, than this deputy of the Pope does of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The upper apartments, and galleries of this place, are filled with a &s;urpri&s;ing collection of antiquities; all the curious &s;tatues and pieces of antiquity, found in and throughout the neighbourhood of the city, having been brought here to the embelli&s;hment of the Cam|pidaglio. An antiquarian cannot help being delighted with the chamber of the emperor, where on two rows of &s;teps is di&s;played a long range of alaba&s;ter and marble bu&s;ts, repre&s;enting the ancient Roman em|perors,
<PB N="290" REF="297">
and their con&s;orts. There is al&s;o a very fine collection of Egyptian deities; each of them quite perfect. In the main building is the gaol for criminals. Near the capitol, is &s;till &s;een the &s;tatue of <HI>Marforio.</HI> This is a colo&s;&s;al figure lying down, but without much merit, and remarkable, only, that again&s;t it are pa&s;ted the an&s;wers to tho&s;e &s;atyrical ver&s;es, &s;tuck upon ano|ther antique &s;tatue, called <HI>Pa&s;quino,</HI> from whence the term Pa&s;quinade aro&s;e, &s;o frequently given to &s;curri|lous and abu&s;ive poems.</P>
<P>Among other curious antiques in the capitol, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> is a va&s;e of fine bronze, fluted, and in &s;hape &s;omewhat like flower-pots, intended to orna|ment gardens. This was the favourite cup of <HI>Mi|thridates,</HI> king of Pontus, who always had it carried with his baggage, to his encampments, and con&s;tantly drank out of it <HI>Pompey</HI> took a like fancy to it, and had it brought to Rome, where it was borne in triumph. It holds more than &s;ix gallons; but &s;eems of the mo&s;t inconvenient &s;hape imaginable for a drink|ing cup; no modern mouth could ea&s;ily take the brim; the capacious jaws of a <HI>Polypheme,</HI> might, in|deed, fill it well.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o the feet, and one hand of a mutilated colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue of <HI>Apollo,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to have been forty-one
<PB N="291" REF="298">
feet high; the great toe mea&s;ures thirty-&s;even inches round.</P>
<P>The &s;uperb palace, called the Vatican, is attached to St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s church, and was for many years the re|&s;idence of the pontiffs. But they have of late pre|ferred <HI>Monte Cavallo</HI> as a drier and healthier &s;ituation. The Vatican, or <HI>Mons Vaticanus,</HI> owes its name to the an&s;wers of the Vates, or prophets, that u&s;ed to be given here; or from the god <HI>Vaticanus;</HI> but it &s;eems not to have been enclo&s;ed within the walls till the time of <HI>Aurelian.</HI> This hill was formerly famous for the &s;epulchre of <HI>Scipio Africanus,</HI> &s;ome remains of which are here &s;till to be &s;een.</P>
<P>The Vatican is a palace extremely irregular, very lofty, and very &s;pacious. It contains eleven thou&s;and and five hundred apartments. No tra|veller can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have either opportu|nity, or inclination, to examine into the truth of this account, &s;o that we mu&s;t depend on the veracity of the Pope's officers and dome&s;tics, who&s;e authority for what they advance, is the wooden model of this palace, which at pre&s;ent is not to be &s;een.</P>
<P>This palace having been built and enlarged at dif|ferent times, there is no proportion or &s;ymmetry ob|&s;erved in its &s;everal parts; and, to avoid damaging
<PB N="292" REF="299">
the fine area before St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s church, it has not &s;o much as a portico in front.</P>
<P>The be&s;t painters of Italy have &s;triven to di&s;play the utmo&s;t of their art, in the beautiful pictures that are every where to be &s;een in the&s;e apartments; and <HI>Ra|phael,</HI> e&s;pecially, has done wonders. His ma&s;ter-piece, is a picture repre&s;enting the hi&s;tory of <HI>Attila.</HI></P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of the paintings, the library and the an|tique &s;tatutes are the principal objects, meriting the attention of a traveller.</P>
<P>The Vatican library is the fine&s;t, and noble&s;t in the world, being full of manu&s;cripts in Hebrew, Greek, and other languages. Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> V. cau&s;ed it to be built from the very foundation, and &s;pared no co&s;t to enrich it with the be&s;t books; but, &s;ince his death, it has been augmented by the Heidelberg library, and that of <HI>Chri&s;tina,</HI> queen of Sweden. It is generally divided into two parts, the public and private; the one is three hundred feet long, and &s;ixty broad: the other con&s;i&s;ts of two rooms, into which admittance is not &s;o ea&s;ily obtained, becau&s;e of the very &s;carce ma|nu&s;cripts contained there.</P>
<P>This library is &s;o con&s;tructed, as to afford a very agreeable <HI>coup d'aeil</HI> at the entrance; but, the books
<PB N="293" REF="300">
being inclo&s;ed in pre&s;&s;es, which are painted, deprives it entirely of the appearance of a library.</P>
<P>In this library &s;tands a white and tran&s;parent column of oriental alaba&s;ter, about ten feet high, which is &s;olid and beautifully fluted. Oppo&s;ite to this pillar is a &s;arcophagus of white marble, and in it a winding-&s;heet made of linen, which readily catches fire, but does not con&s;ume thereby. This linen is &s;ecured by iron-work; and, in order to prove that it &s;tands the fire, our Ciceroni, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> pulled one end of it through the iron, and &s;et fire to it with a lighted <HI>bougie.</HI> It burnt fa&s;t, and pre&s;ently extingui&s;hed of its own accord. The corner, which had endured the flame, appeared rather cleaner and whiter than the re&s;t of the &s;heet, which was all the effect that the fire produced. There are painted, on large pila&s;ters ranged in the middle of the library, tho&s;e per&s;ons who were reputed to have been the inventors of letters in the ancient languages, with the letters which each are &s;aid to have invented, written under their pictures.</P>
<P>They told us, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> that the pre&s;&s;es con|tained &s;eventy thou&s;and printed volumes, and forty thou&s;and manu&s;cripts. They &s;hew a Greek te&s;tament, written in capitals, with the accents, nine hundred years old; &s;everal curious antique bibles in Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, &amp;c. an elegant Greek manu&s;cript of
<PB N="294" REF="301">
the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, in gold letters, given by one of the Popes to <HI>Charlotte</HI> queen of Cyprus; and &s;e|veral others, with curious and high-fini&s;hed miniatures. Among the&s;e is a <HI>Pliny,</HI> with the pictures of all the animals; a <HI>Virgil</HI> of the 5th century, written entirely in capitals, with the figures of the Trojans and Latins in their proper habits; a beautiful manu&s;cript of <HI>Ta&s;&s;o,</HI> and a <HI>Dante,</HI> with miniatures at the top of each page de&s;criptive of the &s;ubjects. Here are al&s;o carefully pre&s;erved, the original love-letters from King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to <HI>Anne Boleyn;</HI> and his treati&s;e on the &s;even &s;acraments written again&s;t <HI>Luther;</HI> with his dedication, in his own hand-writing, to Pope <HI>Leo</HI> X.</P>
<P>In the middle of this palace is a &s;pacious &s;quare, &s;ur|rounded with orange-trees and antique &s;tatues, and therefore called, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler, il giardino delle &s;tatue an|tiche.</HI> It is al&s;o called the <HI>Belvidere,</HI> on account of the glorious pro&s;pect &s;een from it. Here is that noble repo&s;itory of antique &s;culpture, called the Clementine Mu&s;eum; and the pre&s;ent Pope has fitted up a &s;et of apartments, worthy them and him for their better re|ception. It is &s;aid to be the mo&s;t &s;uperb a&s;&s;emblage of the fine&s;t &s;tatues in the whole world; there are eight in all.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t remarkable object we meet with is, a large mutilated &s;tatue, po&s;&s;ibly of <HI>Hercules,</HI> without head,
<PB N="295" REF="302">
hands, or feet; but, for the exqui&s;ite repre&s;entation of the mu&s;cles, &amp;c. preferred by <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> to all the other remains of antiquity. This piece, which is commonly called <HI>il tronco di Belvidere,</HI> is inclo&s;ed with iron-work; and, according to <HI>Lancivi</HI>'s account, was dug up in the <HI>Campo di Fiori.</HI> In the niche of a por|tico, &s;urrounding a &s;mall open court, is the famous <HI>Apollo Belvidere,</HI> and the no le&s;s famous <HI>Laocoon;</HI> the former incomparably the fine&s;t &s;ingle figure, and the latter the fine&s;t group in the world. <HI>Apollo</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to have ju&s;t di&s;charged his arrow at the Python: his attitude is beautiful, natural, and unaffected; his countenance compo&s;ed and elegant; the workman&s;hip of every part exqui&s;ite: he is longer from the middle downwards than nature, &s;ays <HI>Martyn;</HI> but this devia|tion, from the proportion of the human figure, adds greatly to his dignity; and, upon the whole, he has an un&s;peakable &s;ublimity, that in&s;pires admiration, awe, and reverence.</P>
<P>When the folding doors were thrown open, of the niche which conceals the &s;tatue of <HI>Apollo,</HI> &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> I &s;tarted back with &s;urprize. Never did I &s;ee any &s;culpture come &s;o near the life, nor animation ex|pre&s;s &s;o much maje&s;ty and dignity. I was &s;truck with awe. The beautiful proportions of the limbs, the grandeur and noble air diffu&s;ed over the whole figure, his commanding a&s;pect, blended with angelic &s;weet|ne&s;s,
<PB N="296" REF="303">
joined to the mo&s;t perfect feature, made me almo&s;t fancy he breathed and was about to &s;peak.</P>
<P>The point of view, &s;ays <HI>Sherlock,</HI> from whence is &s;een the mo&s;t perfect union of the &s;ublime and beautiful in nature, is from the top of Ve&s;uvius. The point of view, from whence is &s;een the mo&s;t perfect union of the &s;ublime and beautiful in art, is in the court of the <HI>Apollo</HI> of Belvidere. From the former we &s;ee the mouth of the volcano; fields de&s;olated by rivers of lava now frozen; a country of vineyards, of con|&s;iderable extent, diver&s;ified by the mo&s;t beautiful mix|ture of plains and hills; the city of Naples, the hill of Paufilippo, a number of i&s;lands &s;cattered in a va&s;t &s;ea, &amp;c. &amp;c. In the court we &s;ee the <HI>Apollo,</HI> the <HI>Laocoon,</HI> the <HI>Antinous,</HI> and the celebrated tor&s;o of <HI>Hercules,</HI> called the tor&s;o of <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> on account of the admiration which he had for this precious fragment. Here we &s;ee what the Greek nation was. Let me not be told of prejudice for the ancients, I have none; I only do ju&s;tice to the merit of things, and it is very indifferent to me, &s;ays <HI>Sherlock,</HI> where they are found, or who are their authors. To be ju&s;t, we mu&s;t &s;ome|times appear extravagant; when an object is tran&s;cen|dently beautiful, or great, &s;uitable encouragement ought to be given to it. The pen of man cannot do ju&s;tice to the poetry of <HI>Shak&s;peare,</HI> the genius of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, or the works of the Greeks. Many,
<PB N="297" REF="304">
I know, will condemn me for this la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion; but, I deny them to be judges; they will condemn me only, becau&s;e they know not my &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>It is in the Belvidere that we &s;ee the &s;uperiority of the Greeks to all the nations of the world. The di&s;|tance that is between the <HI>Apollo,</HI> the <HI>Laocoon,</HI> and all the be&s;t works of the French and the Italians, is &s;o great, that it is almo&s;t ridiculous to name them to|gether.</P>
<P>Let the young traveller, when he views the <HI>Apollo,</HI> recollect that what he &s;ees has been a rude block of marble. The fir&s;t &s;tep of the arti&s;t was to create the character of this god. Before, therefore, the marble was touched, the &s;culptor had made an effort of genius; and that effort of genius was &s;o great, that all the men who have &s;ucceeded him to this moment, have never been able to make one like it. This eulogium, it may be &s;aid, is too &s;trong; it is not an eulogium, it is a fact: if the fact be not true, name me a &s;tatue equal in invention. Is it the Su&s;annah of <HI>Fiamingo,</HI> the Ju&s;tice of <HI>Gulielmo della porta,</HI> the <HI>Santa Bibiena</HI> of <HI>Bernini,</HI> or is it the <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> of <HI>Michael Angelo?</HI> No man of &s;en&s;e will ever compare them. The <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is not inferior to any Italian or French &s;tatue; but had we not &s;een the tor&s;o, from which it is evident that <HI>Michael Angelo</HI> took the original idea of his &s;tatue, we &s;hould
<PB N="298" REF="305">
never be a&s;toni&s;hed at the invention of that produc|tion. The invention of the <HI>Apollo</HI> a&s;toni&s;hes all men, and a&s;toni&s;hes them in proportion to the time, and at|tention with which they examine it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Apollo</HI> of <HI>Bernini</HI> is a fine &s;tatue; it appears in|different, only becau&s;e we compare it, often, imper|ceptibly with the <HI>Apollo</HI> of <HI>Belvidere.</HI> Neither is the <HI>Apollo</HI> of <HI>Bouchardon,</HI> an indifferent production; but compare the original French &s;tatue, with the copy of the Greek &s;tatue, in the gardens of Ver&s;ailles, the dif|ference is incredible; it is the difference between a man and a god. We cannot &s;ay what a heathen deity was; but we always feel, on viewing this &s;tatue, that it was &s;omething more than human.</P>
<P>When genius is unaccompanied by ta&s;te, it is often &s;urprized at mi&s;&s;ing its effect; the character created, it remained for ta&s;te to chu&s;e a moment to &s;hew this divi|nity; that moment ought to be animating and intere&s;t|ing; it ought to be favourable to grace, maje&s;ty, and expre&s;&s;ion; and, it ought to be &s;o cho&s;en, that the di&s;|po&s;ition of the whole, and the di&s;tribution of each part of the &s;tatue, &s;hould &s;eem to flow from it with &s;impli|city and ea&s;e. The arti&s;t there has cho&s;en the in&s;tant in which this god gives the &s;ublime&s;t proof of his divi|nity, by an act of benevolence, in de&s;troying an enemy of mankind; it is the in&s;tant after he has &s;hot his
<PB N="299" REF="306">
arrow at the &s;erpent Python; the arrow di&s;charged, he follows it with his eyes to ob&s;erve its effect; the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of each part of the body corre&s;ponds to that of the face; and, from an idea &s;o &s;imple, this Grecian has been able to form a work which has obtained the applau&s;es of all men, and has made every arti&s;t de&s;pair.</P>
<P>When a perfect execution is added to genius and ta&s;te, man cannot then go farther. The fini&s;h of this <HI>Apollo</HI> is inconceivable, even to the mo&s;t minute par|ticulars; but the arti&s;t might almo&s;t have been ex|cu&s;ed the trouble of &s;o perfectly completing his work; his conception is &s;o &s;ublime, and his di&s;tribution &s;o happy, that they alone would have commanded the admiration of all men in all countries; and, a proof of this, is the homage every where paid to the ca&s;ts of this breathing god.</P>
<P>The be&s;t way to give an idea of the &s;uperiority, of Greek execution, is to cite a fact. The <HI>Laocoon</HI> was found only with one arm; they wi&s;hed to have another; &s;everal arti&s;ts attempted it, and all failed. <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> the bolde&s;t genius that Italy ever had, who conceived the idea of placing the Pantheon in the air, and who made the dome of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s on the &s;ame dimen&s;ions, thought that he could &s;ucceed in it; and, after having worked at it for two years, aba&s;hed and
<PB N="300" REF="307">
de&s;pairing, be broke his work to pieces. <HI>Gulielmo della Porta,</HI> who&s;e &s;uperb mau&s;oleum, in St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s, &s;hews, that he was an arti&s;t of the fir&s;t rank, &s;aid, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to make it in marble, but that he would make it in clay; and he made the right-arm in clay, as we &s;ee it at pre&s;ent; an inconte&s;tible proof of the unattainable perfection of the Greek execution.</P>
<P>I allow it, &s;ays <HI>Sherlock,</HI> to be a bad proof of our being in the right, that a celebrated man is of our opinion; but, I think every rea&s;onable being &s;hould well examine, before he determines again&s;t a judgment &s;o &s;olid as that of <HI>Pou&s;&s;in,</HI> and a genius &s;o bright as that of <HI>Monte&s;quieu:</HI> the former &s;tudied ince&s;&s;antly the be&s;t works, ancient and modern, on which this was his deci&s;ion: "<HI>Raphael,</HI> compared with the moderns, is an angel; compared with the ancients, he is an a&s;s." Compare the mo&s;t beautiful figure of <HI>Raphael,</HI> detached, with the <HI>Apollo,</HI> and his fine&s;t group with the <HI>Laocoon,</HI> and judge for your&s;elf.</P>
<P>France has no man who does her more honour in foreign countries, or who will do her more with po&s;|terity than <HI>Monte&s;quieu;</HI> it is well known that he made &s;ome &s;tay in Italy, and that he did not view objects like a &s;uperficial ob&s;erver: this was his idea with re|gard to the Greeks; "Ta&s;te, and the arts have been
<PB N="301" REF="308">
carried by them to &s;uch a height, that to think to &s;ur|pa&s;s them, will be always not to know them."</P>
<P>The <HI>Laocoon</HI> a&s;toni&s;hes and terrifies. There is not a feature, or mu&s;cle, which does not expre&s;s the deepe&s;t angui&s;h. <HI>Laocoon</HI> is repre&s;ented in the greate&s;t agony, and with his eyes lifted up to heaven. Near him are his two &s;ons, with the &s;erpents turned about them, whom <HI>Virgil</HI> repre&s;ents at &s;ome di&s;tance from the father, and expiring when he came to their re|lief. The younge&s;t &s;on is fallen down in the agonies of death; the other is not yet hurt, and looking to|ward his father, wi&s;hing to help him, and at the &s;ame time wanting help him&s;elf. The principle figure, <HI>viz.</HI> the father, has lo&s;t the right-arm, and that of pla&s;ter or clay, which hath been &s;ub&s;tituted in its room, is not to be compared to the other parts of the &s;tatue, either for colour or workman&s;hip; even <HI>Michael Angelo</HI> him&s;elf, being ordered to execute another arm for this &s;tatue, is &s;aid, de&s;ignedly, never to have put the fini&s;hing hand to it.</P>
<P>For me, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> to attempt a de&s;cription of the fine &s;pecimens of antique &s;culpture in the Vatican, which have been de&s;cribed a thou&s;and times, and imi|tated as often, without once having ju&s;tice done them, would be equally vain and &s;uperfluous. I &s;hall, there|fore, confine my&s;elf to a very few ob&s;ervations. The
<PB N="302" REF="309">
mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible of mankind mu&s;t be &s;truck with horror at &s;ight of the <HI>Laocoon.</HI> On one of my vi&s;its to the Vatican, I was accompanied by two per&s;ons who had never been there before; one of them was accu&s;ed of being perfectly callous to every thing which did not immediately touch his own per&s;on; the other is a worthy good man: the fir&s;t, after &s;taring for &s;ome time with marks of terror at the groupe, at length re|covered him&s;elf; exclaiming with a laugh,&mdash;"Egad, I was afraid the&s;e d&mdash;d &s;erpents would have left the fellows they are devouring, and made a &s;nap at me; but I am happy to recollect they are of marble."&mdash; "I thank you, Sir, mo&s;t heartily," &s;aid the other, for putting me in mind of that circum&s;tance; till you mentioned it, I was in agony for tho&s;e two youths."</P>
<P>Nothing can be conceived more admirably exe|cuted, than this affecting groupe; in all probability, it never would have entered into my imagination that it could have been in any re&s;pect improved. But, Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> the famous &s;culptor, it &s;eems has ob&s;erved, after mentioning the execution of this piece in the highe&s;t terms of prai&s;e, that, had the figure of <HI>Laocoon</HI> been <HI>alone,</HI> it would have been perfect. As a man &s;uffering the mo&s;t excruciating bodily pain with be|coming fortitude, it admits of no improvement; his proportions, his form, his action, his expre&s;&s;ion, are exqui&s;ite. But, when his &s;ons appear, he is no longer
<PB N="303" REF="310">
an in&s;ulated &s;uffering individual; who, when he has met pain and death with dignity, has done all that could be expected from man; he commences <HI>father,</HI> and a much wider field is opened to the arti&s;t. We expect the deepe&s;t pathos, in the exhibition of the &s;ublime&s;t character, that art can offer to the contem|plation of the human mind; a father forgetting pain, and in&s;tant death, to &s;ave his children. This &s;ublime and pathetic the arti&s;t did not &s;ee, or de&s;paired of at|taining. <HI>Laocoon</HI>'s &s;ufferings are merely corporal; he is deaf to the cries of his agonizing children, who are calling on him for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But, had he been throw|ing a look of angui&s;h on his &s;ons, had he &s;eemed to have forgotten his own &s;ufferings in theirs, he would have commanded the &s;ympathy of the &s;pectator in a much higher degree. On the whole, Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> is of opinion, that the execution of this groupe is perfect, but that the conception is not equal to the execution. Such are Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s &s;entiments; we have only to remark, whether a &s;udden and in&s;tantaneous unex|pected pain of the mo&s;t excruciating kind, po&s;&s;ible to be conceived for the human mind to &s;uffer, does not de&s;troy every other &s;entiment.</P>
<P>Reflecting on the dreadful condition of three per|&s;ons, entangled in the horrid twinings of &s;erpents, and, after contemplating the varied angui&s;h, &s;o &s;trongly ex|pre&s;&s;ed in their countenances, it is a relief to turn the
<PB N="304" REF="311">
eye to the heavenly figure of the <HI>Apollo.</HI> To form an adequate idea of the beauty of this &s;tatue, it is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;een it. With all the ad|vantages of colour and life, the human form never appeared &s;o beautiful; and, we can never &s;ufficiently admire the arti&s;t, who has endowed marble with a finer expre&s;&s;ion of grace, dignity, and under&s;tanding, than ever were &s;een in living figures.</P>
<P>The admired &s;tatue of <HI>Antinous</HI> is in the &s;ame court. Nothing can be more light, elegant, and ea&s;y; the proportions are exact, and the execution perfect. It is an exqui&s;ite repre&s;entation of the mo&s;t beautiful youth that ever lived.</P>
<P>The &s;tatue of the <HI>Apollo</HI> repre&s;ents &s;omething &s;u|perior; and the emotions it excites are all of the &s;u|blime ca&s;t.</P>
<P>Monte cavallo, the Pope's &s;ummer palace, on the Quirinal hill, has its name from two colo&s;&s;al &s;tatues, with each a hor&s;e, which they formerly held by the bridle. They bear the name of <HI>Phidias</HI> and <HI>Praxiteles;</HI> but, whoever was the &s;culptor, they are certainly Grecian, and much the mo&s;t plea&s;ing colo&s;&s;al &s;tatues in Rome. That which is a&s;cribed to <HI>Phidias</HI> is the be&s;t. The hor&s;es have great &s;pirit, but their necks are too thick, and their heads too little. The bridles are
<PB N="305" REF="312">
lo&s;t. <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great,</HI> is &s;aid to have brought them out of Greece, and to have placed them in his baths on the Quirinal mount. The figures, in both, have been &s;uppo&s;ed to repre&s;ent <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Bu|cephalus.</HI></P>
<P>Over the doors of the palace is a balcony, &s;up|ported by two Ionic pillars, from whence the Pope, on &s;olemn occa&s;ions, gives his benediction to the people. This palace, from the &s;alubrity of the air, and its fine pro&s;pect over a large part of the city of Rome, is pre|ferred by the popes, as a re&s;idence to the two former palaces. The building is round a large court, which is &s;urrounded by a portico. A wide double &s;tair-ca&s;e conducts to the great hall.</P>
<P>The gardens belonging to this palace are large, and laid out in good ta&s;te, but not taken care of as they de&s;erve. They are &s;urrounded with very lofty cypre&s;s-trees, and laurels, with &s;ome hedges of myrtles, and are about a mile in circuit. A delightful laurel-grove leads from hence to a lower garden, where the water-works are very &s;urpri&s;ing. Some, by the means of organs, imitate the &s;ound of trumpets and kettle-drums; others, the explo&s;ion of granadoes and rockets.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="313">At one angle of the large garden, the Pope has built two elegant apartments for his particular retirement, and furni&s;hed them after the Engli&s;h ta&s;te, even to the mo&s;t minute articles. This building is called the coffee-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The palaces of Rome line the &s;treets and &s;quares, which thus owe their greate&s;t ornament to the&s;e va&s;t edifices. The architecture is good in very few; but, in many, the prodigious extent, united to a magnifi|cence of decoration, is &s;triking: &s;uch are the <HI>Barbe|rini, Borghe&s;e, Bracciano, Altieri,</HI> and <HI>Colonna</HI> palaces. In the interior di&s;tribution, magnificence is the lead|ing feature, to which convenience often gives place. <HI>Smollett</HI> &s;ays, he was told there were above three hun|dred palaces in Rome; but that, in fact, their num|ber did not exceed four&s;core; and, &s;o far from there being &s;carce a Roman prince, who&s;e revenue did not exceed fifty thou&s;and pounds; that he &s;carce found &s;ix individuals who had ten thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Of the principal of the&s;e palaces we &s;hall give a &s;ummary view. The <HI>Altieri</HI> palace is one of the large&s;t in Rome. It is plain on the out&s;ide, and a re|markably good piece of brick-work. The &s;tairca&s;e is grand. The library of <HI>Clement</HI> X. in this palace, is rich in manu&s;cripts, medals, &amp;c. The prince&s;s's apartments con&s;i&s;t of &s;even noble rooms well fur|ni&s;hed.
<PB N="307" REF="314">
In the bedchamber, of the Prince <HI>Ga&s;per Altieri,</HI> is the chariot of the &s;un in fre&s;co, by <HI>F. Chiari;</HI> and the cieling, of the room adjoining to it, was painted by <HI>Carlo Maratti.</HI> The cardinal's bed of &s;tate is valued at thirty thou&s;and crowns. Here is al&s;o &s;hewn an octangular &s;peculum of rock cry&s;tal, ten inches long, and &s;ix broad, in a frame of gold &s;et with amethy&s;ts, emeralds, &s;apphires, topazes, and diamonds; the whole weighs twelve pounds, and is by &s;ome e&s;ti|mated at fifteen thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>The <HI>Barberini</HI> palace is exceeded only by the Va|tican, and contains four thou&s;and rooms or apartments. The two main &s;tairca&s;es are extremely grand; and, on one of them is a very large antique lion, much admired for the excellence of the workman&s;hip. This palace re&s;embles two or three joined together; and, contiguous to it, is a very large garden, orna|mented with fountains, &s;tatues, &amp;c. The collection of fine pictures, antiques, and other curio&s;ities in this palace, is prodigious. The library is in the upper &s;tory, one hundred and ninety-&s;even &s;teps leading up to it; they pretend that there are &s;ixty thou&s;and volumes of printed books, and nine thou&s;and manu|&s;cripts. The great room is one hundred feet long, thirty-four broad, and twenty high; with a covered cieling. There is a cabinet of medals, antique gems, bronzes, &amp;c. The jewels of this family, as is the
<PB N="308" REF="315">
cu&s;tom with all the great and princely families in Italy, are kept in a large cabinet, and form a kind of regalia. Here is an a&s;toni&s;hing quantity of precious &s;tones and pearls. The jewels the duche&s;s wears are mag|nificent. The diamonds are of a much larger &s;ize than any in England, except tho&s;e belonging to the crown; and there are a va&s;t number of large pearls, of the fine&s;t water, and mo&s;t exact formation.</P>
<P>The celebrated <HI>Borghe&s;e</HI> palace is very bad archi|tecture, both within and without; a va&s;t extent of front without any break, order, or elegance. It is all of brick, &s;tuccoed. The great court has double porticos, &s;upported by an hundred granite columns. In this palace are &s;eventeen hundred original pic|tures, which are reckoned worth &s;everal millions of money.</P>
<P>As this palace exceeds any other in Rome, for paintings, &amp;c. it is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee &s;o much mean fur|niture, e&s;pecially the chairs and &s;eats, amid&s;t &s;o much &s;plendor and magnificence.</P>
<P>The palace of Prince <HI>Odi&s;calchi,</HI> was, formerly, for paintings and &s;tatues, one of the mo&s;t remarkable in Rome; but, at pre&s;ent, the front of it, by <HI>Bernini,</HI> is the only thing worth ob&s;erving. The fine&s;t pieces by <HI>Corregio</HI> and <HI>Paul Verone&s;e,</HI> as likewi&s;e all that be|longed
<PB N="309" REF="316">
to Queen <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI>'s collection, were &s;old to the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> regent of France.</P>
<P>The <HI>Colonna</HI> palace, fronting to the &s;quare of the twelve apo&s;tles, is of great extent; and the apartments are magnificent, and hand&s;omely fitted up. They are full of pictures by the be&s;t ma&s;ters. The gallery is one of the fine&s;t and riche&s;t in Europe, one hundred and thirty-nine feet long, thirty-four broad, and &s;eventy high, and has &s;ome capital paintings. Here is a ca|binet, &s;tudded with precious &s;tones, which belonged to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and was &s;old by <HI>Cromwell</HI> to Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> who&s;e niece married into the <HI>Colonna</HI> fa|mily. Among other expen&s;ive furniture is a clock, &s;hewing the hour of the day, the month, year, &amp;c. which is wound up but once a year. Here is al&s;o a bed finely gilt, and made in the form of a &s;hell, drawn by four &s;ea-hor&s;es, like <HI>Neptune</HI>'s triumphal car. This was the bed in which <HI>Maria Marcini,</HI> cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI>'s niece, lay in of her fir&s;t child. This lady was famous for the pa&s;&s;ion which <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. entertained for her. The con&s;table <HI>Colonna</HI>'s &s;tables are inferior to none in Rome, and well &s;tocked with Spani&s;h, Neapolitan and Barbary hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;ini is a noble palace, without architecture; twenty-two windows in front, a fine &s;uite of rooms, and a large garden, part of which is in the Janiculeum,
<PB N="310" REF="317">
and commands one of the noble&s;t views in Rome. The library is well di&s;po&s;ed and public. It con&s;i&s;ts of four rooms, twenty-four feet &s;quare, and &s;ixteen high; in one of which is a large collection of prints and drawings; three others for new books, and a gallery &s;eventy feet by twenty.</P>
<P>The Farne&s;e palace, belonging to the king of the two Sicilies, is the mo&s;t &s;uperb in Rome. It was chiefly built by <HI>Michael Angelo.</HI> In the court are three orders, Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, with open arcades round it.</P>
<P>In the apartments, of this now de&s;erted palace, are &s;ome good &s;tatues and bu&s;ts: but its great ornament is the gallery, painted in fre&s;co, by <HI>A. Caracci.</HI> The beauty of this palace is not viewed without concern; for not only the famous cube, but &s;everal other orna|ments, have been brought here from <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI>'s theatre, to the great detriment of that incomparable &s;tructure. In the court are &s;everal ancient &s;tatues of a large &s;ize, viz. a gladiator, <HI>Flora,</HI> and two &s;tatues of <HI>Hercules,</HI> exactly re&s;embling each other, but not equally well cut. That on the left-hand is the Farne|&s;ian <HI>Hercules,</HI> and is the work of <HI>Glycon,</HI> an Athenian, as appears from the in&s;cription. The &s;tatue of <HI>Flora</HI> near it, is mutilated; but, for the finene&s;s of the dra|pery, few of the ancient pieces can be compared with it.
<PB N="311" REF="318">
The <HI>Toro Farne&s;ian</HI> is al&s;o much admired. The &s;ubject of this piece is, <HI>Amphion</HI> and <HI>Zethus</HI> tying <HI>Dirce</HI> by the hair to the tail of a bull, in revenge for her having robbed her mother <HI>Antiope,</HI> of their father's love. Though the figures are larger than life, it is &s;aid to be one entire piece of marble. According to <HI>Marlyn,</HI> the&s;e three &s;tatues have been very recently removed to Naples.</P>
<P>The Farne&s;ian <HI>Hercules,</HI> remarks <HI>Moore,</HI> has been long admired as an exqui&s;ite model of ma&s;culine &s;trength; yet, admirable as it is, it does not plea&s;e all the world. The women, in particular, find &s;ome|thing un&s;atisfactory, and even odious in this figure; which, however maje&s;tic, is deficient in the charms mo&s;t agreeable to them; and which might have been expected in the &s;on of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and the beauteous <HI>Alcmene.</HI> A lady, adds <HI>Moore,</HI> whom I accompanied to the Farne&s;e palace, turned away from it with di&s;gu&s;t. I could not imagine what had &s;hocked her. She told me, after recollection, that &s;he could not bear the &s;tern &s;everity of his countenance; that his large brawny limbs, and the club with which he was armed, gave him more the appearance of one of tho&s;e giants, that, according to the old romances, carried away virgins, and &s;hut them up in gloomy ca&s;tles, than the gallant <HI>Hercules,</HI> the lover of <HI>Omphale.</HI> Finally, the lady de|clared, that &s;he was convinced this &s;tatue could not be a
<PB N="312" REF="319">
ju&s;t repre&s;entation of <HI>Hercules;</HI> for it was not in the nature of things, that a man &s;o formed could ever have been a reliever of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed dam&s;els.</P>
<P>Without &s;uch powerful &s;upports as that of the fair &s;ex, I &s;hould not have expo&s;ed my&s;elf to the re&s;ent|ment of connoi&s;&s;eurs, by venturing to a&s;&s;ert, that the Farne&s;e <HI>Hercules</HI> is faulty both in form and attitude: the former is too wieldy for active exertion, and the latter exhibits vigour exhau&s;ted. A re&s;ting attitude is not the mo&s;t proper, in which the all-conquering god of &s;trength could be repre&s;ented. Re&s;t implies fatigue; and fatigue, &s;trength exhau&s;ted A repo&s;ing <HI>Hercules</HI> is almo&s;t a contradiction. Invincible activity, and inexhau&s;tible &s;trength are his characteri&s;tics.</P>
<P>Next to <HI>Hercules,</HI> is a mo&s;t beautiful &s;tatue of <HI>Flora.</HI> The great advantage, remarks <HI>Moore,</HI> which the an|cient arti&s;ts had in attending the exerci&s;es of the gym|na&s;ia, has been repeatedly urged as the rea&s;on of their &s;uperiority over the moderns in &s;culpture. We are told that, be&s;ides the u&s;ual exerci&s;es of the gymna&s;ia, all tho&s;e who propo&s;ed to contend at the Olympic games, were obliged by the regulations to prepare them&s;elves, by exerci&s;ing publickly for a year; and the &s;tatuaries and painters con&s;tantly attended on the arena, where they beheld the mo&s;t graceful of the Grecian youths employed in the&s;e &s;ports, in which the
<PB N="313" REF="320">
power of every mu&s;cle was exerted; and, where the human form appeared in an infinite variety of atti|tudes. By con&s;tant attendance at &s;uch a &s;chool, the arti&s;ts are &s;uppo&s;ed to have acquired a more animated, true, and graceful &s;tyle, than can po&s;&s;ibly be caught from viewing the tame, mercenary models exhibited in our academies.</P>
<P>On the other hand it is a&s;&s;erted, that the arti&s;t, who formed the Farne&s;ian <HI>Flora,</HI> could not have improved his work, or derived any of its excellencies from the circum&s;tances above enumerated; becau&s;e, the figure is in a &s;tanding po&s;ture, and cloathed. In the light ea&s;y flow of the drapery, the contour of the body, being as di&s;tinctly perceptible, as if the &s;tatue was naked, the chief merit of this &s;tatue is thought to con|&s;i&s;t. But this rea&s;oning does not &s;eem ju&s;t; for the daily opportunities which the antient arti&s;ts had of &s;eeing naked figures, in every variety of action and attitude, mu&s;t have given them advantages over the moderns, in forming even drapery figures. At Sparta, the women, upon particular occa&s;ions, danced naked. In their own families, they were &s;een every day clothed in light draperies; and, &s;o &s;econdary was every con|&s;ideration, even that of decency, to art, that the pret|tie&s;t women of Agrigentum, it is recorded, were called upon by the legi&s;lature, without di&s;tinction, to &s;hew them&s;elves naked to a painter, to enable him to
<PB N="314" REF="321">
paint a <HI>Venus.</HI> Whil&s;t the moderns, therefore, mu&s;t acknowledge their inferiority to the ancients in the art of &s;culpture; they may be allowed merit, on account of the cau&s;e, to which it &s;eems in &s;ome mea&s;ure, at lea&s;t, to be owing.</P>
<P>As prince <HI>Giu&s;tiniani</HI>'s palace is one of the mo&s;t re|markable for excellent paintings, &s;o it exceeds any in Rome for fine &s;tatues. The &s;econd &s;tory con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;uite of eleven &s;pacious apartments; through all which is a noble vi&s;ta, &s;uperior to any of that kind in Rome. A particular de&s;cription of the original paintings, which are no le&s;s than &s;even hundred, and the antique monuments which are nineteen hundred, five hun|dred of which are &s;tatues, occupy two volumes folio.</P>
<P>On the &s;pot where this palace &s;tands were, anciently, the baths of <HI>Nero</HI> and <HI>Severus;</HI> &s;o that, at laying the new foundation, <HI>granates, ba&s;alte,</HI> and other kinds of fine marbles, with a great number of &s;tatues, bu&s;ts and bas-reliefs, were found there, which are noble orna|ments to the palace.</P>
<P>Some idea of the extent of the <HI>Pamfili</HI> palace may be formed, and which is equally large and magni|ficent; when our readers are informed, that upwards of four thou&s;and per&s;ons were entertained in it; when
<PB N="315" REF="322">
Prince <HI>Doria,</HI> the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, received the arch-duke and archduche&s;s of Au&s;tria, in the year 1780. There are no le&s;s than eighteen palaces belonging to this family, &s;even of which are in Rome.</P>

<P>IF a city is entitled to the appellation of holy, from the number of its churches, Rome unque&s;tionably merits it.

The chapel alone of S. <HI>Ignatius,</HI> in the church dedicated to our Saviour, would pur|cha&s;e a whole province. I &s;peak not of its pillars of <HI>verd antique,</HI> its niches of oriental alaba&s;ter, its columns of <HI>lapis lazuli,</HI> and the gilded bronze, which every where dazzles the eyes; I con&s;ider only the &s;ilver, the gold, and the precious &s;tones, which are worked up with &s;o much ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The principal of the&s;e churches, is that of St. <HI>John de Lateran;</HI> which, though inferior to St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s in di|men&s;ions and architecture, is the metropolitan church in Rome. It was built by <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> and &s;tiled <HI>mater orbis &amp; urbis.</HI> The emperors formerly received their crowns in this church; and here, the Pope &s;till takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dignity, and confers all eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices. The fabric of this church has been much enlarged, &s;ince the time of <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> and is very beautiful. It has five doors, one of which is called the 'holy door,' being opened only in the jubilee year. The number of its precious &s;hrines, and other valuable ornaments, is very great; but nothing is more valued than a plain tin chalice, which is &s;aid to
<PB N="317" REF="324">
have been made u&s;e of by S. <HI>Peter.</HI> The mo&s;t va|luable curio&s;ity in this church, is the coffin of <HI>Helena,</HI> mother to <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great,</HI> made of a &s;ingle piece of porphyry, with large bas-reliefs, repre&s;enting hor&s;emen, and other figures. This is even larger than the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;hrine of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> in St. <HI>Con&s;tantin</HI>'s church, but is damaged in &s;everal places. It was dug up in the <HI>Via Labicana,</HI> about three miles from Rome.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o the famous chairs, or &s;tools, called <HI>&s;tellae &s;tercoratoriae,</HI> or <HI>exploratoriae.</HI> They are two in number, and between them is a chair of white marble, elevated &s;omething above them; both are of porphyry. Before I had &s;een them, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> I was a&s;&s;ured they were only the common chairs u&s;ed by the ancient Romans, in which a hole had been made and lined with wood. But, in viewing them, they did not &s;eem at all adapted for the purpo&s;e of night &s;tools; the aper|ture not being of a &s;ufficient &s;ize, and incommodiou&s;ly placed. It is certain, however, that the popes, at their taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lateran, were formerly placed on the&s;e &s;tools, or chairs; this the popi&s;h writers cannot deny; and <HI>Mabillon</HI> makes it an act of humility, perfectly agreeable to the words which are &s;ung at this ceremony: "He rai&s;es the needy from the du&s;t, and the poor from the dunghill, that he
<PB N="318" REF="325">
may &s;it with princes, and po&s;&s;e&s;s a throne of glory." Hence this chair came to be called <HI>&s;tella &s;tercoraria.</HI></P>
<P>The indecent examination of the Pope's &s;ex, about which &s;ome writers have been very joco&s;e, may, per|haps, be ju&s;tly exploded as fabulous; but, it is not a prote&s;tant fable; Roman Catholic writers having fir&s;t &s;et it on foot, and introduced it into their &s;atyres: as, for in&s;tance, the following epigram, among many others of the &s;ame kind, by <HI>Marcelli,</HI> on the <HI>Cibo</HI> family.</P>
<Q><L>Quid quaeris te&s;tes, &s;it mas an faemina Cibo?</L>

<P>The whole hi&s;tory, or fable of pope <HI>Joan,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed current before <HI>Luther</HI> was born; as is evident from the ancient manu&s;cripts of <HI>Ana&s;ta&s;ius, M. Polonus,</HI> and others. In a hi&s;tory of modern Rome, written by one <HI>Tentzell,</HI> and very &s;carce, is the following pa&s;&s;age re&s;pecting that lady, which was purloined from the Vati|can library. "In the papal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, it appears, that <HI>John,</HI> an Engli&s;hman, &s;ucceeded <HI>Leo,</HI> and held the pon|tificate two years, five months, and four days, when there was a vacancy of a month, in the papal chair.
<PB N="319" REF="326">
This pope is affirmed to have been a woman; who, being di&s;gui&s;ed like a young man, was carried by her gallant to Athens, and made &s;uch a progre&s;s in all the &s;ciences, that &s;he publickly read lectures at Rome for three years, the greate&s;t ma&s;ters being among her au|ditors; nor was there any equal to her, for parts and learning, in that city. At length, &s;he ro&s;e to &s;uch a pitch of reputation, as to be unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en pope; but, during her pontificate, &s;he unhappily con|ceived by her former gallant; and, being ignorant of the time of her delivery, &s;he fell in labour as &s;he was returning from St. <HI>Peters</HI> to the Lateran, and was de|livered between the Coli&s;aeum and St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s church, where &s;he is &s;aid to have expired. The Pope's cu&s;tom of turning a&s;ide when he pa&s;&s;es this way, is &s;aid to be done, in order to expre&s;s his de|te&s;tation of this affair; neither is &s;he &s;et down in the li&s;t of popes, on account of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cor&s;ini</HI> chapel, belonging to this church, is pro|bably the mo&s;t elegant in Europe, both for its pro|portions, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the marbles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scala Santa</HI> is oppo&s;ite to this church; it con|&s;i&s;ts of twenty-eight marble &s;teps, &s;aid to be brought from Pilate's palace at Jeru&s;alem; and, in the &s;pa|cious area &s;tands a great Egyptian obeli&s;k.</P>

<P>The church of St. <HI>Onofrio</HI> is not without &s;ome good paintings; but what chiefly draws a foreigner hither, is the fine view which this church affords all over the city of Rome. The remains of the celebrated poet <HI>Torquato Ta&s;&s;o</HI> lie interred here.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are fond of hor&s;es may meet with great entertainment at St. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s church, on the 17th of January; that day being the fe&s;tival of the &s;aint, when all the hor&s;es, mules, &amp;c. belonging to the Pope, car|dinals, prelates, princes, and other great men, are drawn up before the church door, where a prie&s;t &s;prin|kles them with holy water. If the hor&s;es and mules receive no benefit from this practice, the monks, at lea&s;t, find the &s;weets of it. At Sienna, the hor&s;es which are to run the race on the a&s;&s;umption of the Virgin

<P>On the altar of the church of St. <HI>Pietro,</HI> in Mon|torio, is the mo&s;t celebrated picture, at pre&s;ent known in the whole world; it is the transfiguration of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> on Mount Tabor, and was the la&s;t work of <HI>Raphael</HI>'s admirable pencil. No monumental in&s;cription hav|ing been thought &s;ufficient to expre&s;s the prai&s;e of that great arti&s;t; this picture was &s;et up, near his re|mains, as the mo&s;t affecting and &s;tronge&s;t proof of the irreparable lo&s;s the world &s;u&s;tained, by his premature exit; for he died in the thirty-&s;eventh year of his age.</P>
<P>This transfiguration, &s;ays <HI>Sherlock,</HI> is a &s;chool of painting. If the art was lo&s;t, and this picture remained, it would be alone &s;ufficient to form painters. All the parts of painting are united in it; the mo&s;t exact drawing, the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and picture&s;que di&s;po&s;ition, a perfect harmony of colouring, and a &s;ublimity in the upper part of the picture, which tran&s;ports the &s;pecta|tor as much as the groupes below intere&s;t him. <HI>Ra|phael</HI>

<P>The &s;tudies of the belles-lettres, and antiquities, are more followed at Rome than the &s;ciences. <HI>La &s;a|pienza</HI> is the principal of the colleges; and, as it were, the centre of the univer&s;ity. There are eight profe&s;|&s;ors of theology, &s;ix of civil and canon law, eight of medicine, five of philo&s;ophy, one of belles-lettres, and four of the Ea&s;tern and Greek languages.</P>
<P>The college of <HI>La Propaganda</HI> was founded by <HI>Gregory</HI> XV. There are &s;everal profe&s;&s;ors belong|ing to it, who give lectures on theology, philo&s;ophy, the belles-lettres, and the oriental languages, to the young eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who are de&s;igned for foreign mi&s;|&s;ion. The Roman college is a va&s;t, heavy edifice, built by <HI>Gregory</HI> XIII. This is dedicated to the edu|cation
<PB N="325" REF="332">
of youth, as are al&s;o the <HI>Clementine</HI> and <HI>Naza|rene</HI> colleges.</P>
<P>For the encouragement of learning, there are al&s;o many public libraries in Rome. That of the Vatican is univer&s;ally known. The other principal ones are in the <HI>Altieri, Albani, Barberini, Borghe&s;e, Cor&s;ini, Ghizi, Imperiali,</HI> and <HI>Pamfili</HI> palaces; at the <HI>Sapienza, Propaganda,</HI> and Roman colleges; in the convents of St. <HI>Ago&s;tino, Ge&s;u,</HI> St. <HI>Maria &s;opra Minerva,</HI> &amp;c. Mo&s;t religious hou&s;es of note have, likewi&s;e, con&s;iderable libraries, which are ea&s;ily acce&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>It appears that there are very few &s;tudents in the&s;e univer&s;ities, the Je&s;uits having every where monopo|lized the education of youth in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tates.</P>
<P>Rome is full of tho&s;e foundations, for which religion lays opulence under contribution; &s;uch are the con|&s;ervatories, &s;ome of which are for orphans, &s;ome for children brought thither by their parents, and not &s;el|dom taken from them when their poverty endangers their morals; there are al&s;o hours of reformation for children who are di&s;obedient, or taking bad cour&s;es; and other for wives, under, the misfortune of having bad hu&s;bands. There are no le&s;s than thirty ho&s;pitals, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> for the relief of the &s;ick and poor in the city of Rome, but none of them equal the <HI>Santo
<PB N="326" REF="333">
Spirito;</HI> in which there are, generally, above a thou&s;and patients, and all well taken care of.</P>
<P>Forty nur&s;es are con&s;tantly kept in pay, to take care of the infants; which every night are put into the machines at the foundling ho&s;pitals. Be&s;ides the&s;e, above two thou&s;and nur&s;es, in the city and neighbour|ing villages, have wages for nur&s;ing the children till they are four or five years old; and then the boys are brought to the ho&s;pital to be in&s;tructed in handicraft trades, or polite arts, according to their different genius, when they are provided with all nece&s;&s;aries, till they are able to maintain them&s;elves. The girls, who generally exceed five hundred in number, are educated under the in&s;pection of a convent of nuns, till they are fit for the convent, or marriageable. If the latter be their choice, they have a portion of a hundred crowns. This ho&s;pital, though part of its revenues has been curtailed by &s;ome of the popes, to endow other charities which &s;tood in need of its a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, has &s;till an annual income of five and twenty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; be&s;ides the produce ari&s;ing from the circulation of the money, in the bank belong|ing to it.</P>
<P>The ho&s;pital of St. <HI>Michael</HI> is another admirable foundation for bringing up poor orphans, who are al|lowed to chu&s;e their trade; and, when they are
<PB N="327" REF="334">
twenty years old, and able to maintain them&s;elves, they are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the hou&s;e, new cloathed from head to foot, with five and twenty crowns in their pockets. Into this ho&s;pital are al&s;o admitted, old di&s;abled &s;ervants, and others incapable, by age and in|firmities, of earning their bread. In the chapel, the two &s;exes are &s;eparated from each other by an iron grate; it being Lent, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> when I vi&s;ited this ho&s;pital, their food con&s;i&s;ted of a piece of dried fi&s;h, &s;ome che&s;nuts, and bread, with a can of wine.</P>
<P>Every country in Europe, where the Roman Ca|tholic religion is profe&s;&s;ed, has likewi&s;e its ho&s;pital for pilgrims, in Rome; but; the ho&s;pital of the Trinity, receives all nations indi&s;criminately; and has fre|quently entertained fifteen thou&s;and pilgrims under its roof at once. The manner of receiving them is as follows: the pilgrims, as &s;oon as they arrive, pre&s;ent them&s;elves before the officers of the hou&s;e; and, on producing their certificates, their names are entered in the books of the ho&s;pital, and each per&s;on receives a medal, or ticket of admi&s;&s;ion. They are then led into a large chamber; where a prie&s;t, having &s;aid prayers, wa&s;hes all their feet, and dre&s;&s;es the wounds of tho&s;e, who&s;e feet have been hurt, or bli&s;tered by travelling; this done, they are led into the refectory; and, having &s;upped, are &s;hewn into the common dor|mitory,

where each individual has his bed a&s;&s;igned him.</P>
<P>The Pazzarella, or ho&s;pital for lunatics, very much re&s;embles Bedlam in its in&s;titution; except that this charity is more exten&s;ive, and provides for people of all nations, who are di&s;ordered in their intellects, as appears from two Engli&s;h quakers, who were mer|chants in Italy, and had learnt the Italian language. The&s;e quakers, it &s;eems, from an exce&s;s of zeal, looked upon it as meritorious, to endeavour to make a convert of the Pope to quakeri&s;m; they, accordingly, applied to his dome&s;tics for an audience; nor did they make any &s;ecret of their bu&s;ine&s;s with his Holi|ne&s;s, which they told in their u&s;ual cant terms and jargon. At fir&s;t, they were laughed at, as people di&s;|po&s;ed to be merry; but, repeatedly continuing their &s;olicitations with great earne&s;tne&s;s, they were looked upon as madmen; and the Pope's officers, out of cha|rity, &s;ent them to the Pazzarella, as it is called. The grvernor of the hou&s;e, thinking their zeal and tran&s;|ports to be certain indications of a di&s;ordered brain, &s;hut them in a dungeon, and treated them with great rigour. The phy&s;icians al&s;o purged them mo&s;t violently, repeating and &s;trengthening their do&s;es, as they ob&s;erved their ravings encrea&s;e; but, all proving ineffectual, they were neglected as per&s;ons incurable, and permitted to walk about the ho&s;pital with the

harmle&s;s lunatics, where they were &s;een by &s;ome Eng|li&s;h gentlemen, who, being informed for what rea&s;on they were confined, procured their relea&s;e, and had them &s;hipped off for England.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Environs of Rome.</HEAD>
<P>THE warmth of the climates nece&s;&s;arily makes the inhabitants fond of villas and gardens; where, in &s;ummer, they may retire for the benefit of fre&s;h air. Of the&s;e there are ten or twelve, in the neighbourhood of the city, u&s;ually vi&s;ited by &s;trangers. From this we may judge what a ta&s;k they undertake, who re&s;olve to go through the whole; and what kind of an idea they are likely to carry away, who perform this ta&s;k during a &s;tay of a few months. Of the&s;e the <HI>villa Borghe&s;e</HI> ranks fir&s;t; it is one of the fine&s;t &s;pots in all Italy; and, as St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at Rome is the mo&s;t &s;uperb church in the world; &s;o this villa, for beauty, ornaments, and curio&s;ities, may be &s;aid to exceed all other country &s;eats in Italy, or el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, remarks <HI>Smollet,</HI> the&s;e villas would make a complete academy for painting, and &s;culpture, e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="331" REF="338">
for the &s;tudy of ancient marbles; for, exclu&s;ive of the &s;tatues and bu&s;ts in the garden, and the va&s;t collection in the different apartments, almo&s;t the whole out&s;ide of the hou&s;e is covered with curious pieces in ba&s;&s;o, and alto relievo.</P>
<P>It &s;tands at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a league from the <HI>Porta Pinciana,</HI> and is enclo&s;ed within a wall, of five Italian miles in compa&s;s; containing a variety of &s;ituations, high and low, which favour all the na|tural embelli&s;hments one would expect to meet with in a garden, and exhibit a diver&s;ity of noble views of the city and adjacent country. The part, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> is fine, and with a few alterations would be e&s;teemed &s;uch even in England; the verdure is lively, and the trees old and well grown. To this part, the Engli&s;h are permitted by the Borghe&s;e family to re|pair twice a week, and play at cricket and foot-ball; we women, adds Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> go &s;ometimes and &s;ee the &s;port, as do the Roman ladies, attended by their <HI>abb&eacute;s,</HI> who form a brilliant body of &s;pectators.</P>
<P>In the gardens are, at lea&s;t, twenty beautiful walks; and all the vi&s;ta's are terminated by &s;tatues and foun|tains. The e&s;paliers con&s;i&s;t of je&s;&s;amine or orange-trees, myrtle, &amp;c. In other parts of the garden are &s;eparate little parks for deers and hares, and a warren for rabbits. Here is al&s;o a large canal &s;tocked with
<PB N="323" REF="339">
&s;wans, and all kinds of aquatic fowls. In two large and lofty aviaries are to be &s;een all birds of the known feathered &s;pecies; and the flower-garden exhibits the mo&s;t beautiful flowers and remarkable vegetables.</P>
<P>At the entrance are the following curious regula|tions, relating to the garden of the Villa Borghe&s;e. "I, the keeper of the Villa Borghe&s;e, give notice, that whoever thou art, if thou art free, thou neede&s;t not fear any &s;hackles of the law &s;hould re&s;train thee here; go where thou wilt, gather what thou plea&s;e&s;t, and &s;tay or go when it is agreeable to thee. All thou &s;ee&s;t, is rather for the entertainment of &s;trangers than of the owner; who, mindful of the ine&s;timable freedom of the golden age, bani&s;hes, from the&s;e tranquil man&s;ions, laws invented in the iron age: let good manners be the only law to be ob&s;erved here. But, &s;houlde&s;t thou wantonly and deliberately break the golden rule, that good breeding dictates; beware, left the provoked gardner &s;hould al&s;o break through the bounds of civi|lity and friend&s;hip."</P>
<P>Of the curio&s;ities contained in the palace, we &s;hall confine our&s;elves to a few remarks on &s;ome of the mo&s;t e&s;teemed. The hermaphrodite, of which there are &s;o many prints and models, is accounted by many, one of the fine&s;t pieces of &s;culpture in the world. The mattra&s;s, upon which this fine figure reclines, is the
<PB N="333" REF="340">
work of <HI>Bernini,</HI> and nothing can be more admirably executed. Some critics &s;ay, he has performed his ta&s;k too well, becau&s;e the admiration of the &s;pectator is divided between the &s;tatue and the mattra&s;s. This, however, ought not to be imputed as a fault to that great arti&s;t; &s;ince he conde&s;cended to make it at all, it was his bu&s;ine&s;s to make it as perfect as po&s;&s;ible. It is &s;aid, there was an arti&s;t at Ver&s;ailles, in a different line, who attempted &s;omething of the &s;ame nature; he had exerted all his abilities in making a periwig for a celebrated preacher, who was to preach on a particular occa&s;ion before the court; and, he imagined he had &s;ucceeded to a miracle. "I'll be hanged," &s;aid he, to one of his companions, "if his Maje&s;ty, or any man of ta&s;te, will pay much attention to the &s;ermon to-day."</P>
<P>Among the antiques, there is a centaur in marble, with a cupid mounted on his back. The latter has the ce&s;tus of <HI>Venus,</HI> and the ivy crown of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> in allu|&s;ion to beauty and wine; he beats the centaur with his fi&s;t, and &s;eems to kick with violence, to drive him along. The centaur throws back his head and eyes with a look of remor&s;e, as if he were unwilling, though forced, to proceed. The execution of this groupe is admired by tho&s;e who look upon it, merely as a <HI>jeu d'e&s;prit;</HI> but it acquires additional merit, when con|&s;idered as allegorical of men, hurried on by the
<PB N="334" REF="341">
violence of their pa&s;&s;ions, and lamenting their own weakne&s;s, while they find them&s;elves unable to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>There is another figure which claims attention, more on account of the allegory than the &s;culpture. This is a &s;mall &s;tatue of <HI>Venus Cloacina,</HI> trampling on an impregnated uterus, and tearing the wings of <HI>Cupid.</HI> The allegory indicates, that pro&s;titution is equally de&s;tructive of generation and love.</P>
<P>This villa is al&s;o enriched by one of the mo&s;t ani|mated &s;tatues in the world; and which, in the opinion many, comes neare&s;t, and, in the judgment of &s;ome, equals the <HI>Apollo</HI> of the Vatican; this is the &s;tatue of the fighting gladiator. It is difficult, however, to com|pare two pieces who&s;e merits are &s;o different. The <HI>Apollo</HI> is full of grace, maje&s;ty, and con&s;cious &s;upe|riority; he has &s;hot his arrow, and knows its &s;ucce&s;s. There is, indeed, a &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion of indignation which opens his lips, di&s;tends his no&s;trils, and contra&s;ts his brows; but, it is the indignation of a &s;uperior being, who puni&s;hes, whil&s;t he &s;corns the efforts of his enemy. The gladiator, on the contrary, full of fire and youthful courage, oppo&s;es an enemy he does not fear; but whom, it is evident, he thinks worthy of his utmo&s;t exertion; every limb, nerve, and &s;inew is in action; his ardent features indicate the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire, the highe&s;t expectation; but not a perfect &s;ecu|rity
<PB N="335" REF="342">
of victory. His &s;hape is elegant as well as ner|vous; expre&s;&s;ive of agility as well as &s;trength; and equally di&s;tant from the brawny &s;trength of the <HI>Far|ne&s;ian Hercules,</HI> and the effeminate &s;oftne&s;s of the <HI>Bel|videre Antinous.</HI></P>
<P>Though this fine figure generally goes by the name of the fighting gladiator, &s;ome antiquarians cannot allow, that ever it was intended to repre&s;ent a per&s;on of that profe&s;&s;ion, but a victor at the Olympic games; and a&s;&s;ert, that it is the identical &s;tatue made by order of the Athenian &s;tate, in honour of their countryman <HI>Chabrias;</HI> and, that it is preci&s;ely in the attitude which, according to <HI>Cornelius Nepos,</HI> that hero a&s;&s;umed when he repul&s;ed the army of <HI>Age&s;ilaus.</HI></P>
<P>There are eight or ten of the&s;e villas in the out|&s;kirts of Rome, highly celebrated for their delightful pro&s;pects, their beautiful gardens, their &s;uperb collec|tion of antique &s;tatues and paintings, by the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of the art; but, to enumerate them &s;eparately would be &s;uperfluous and tedious in the de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of the&s;e villas belonging to the Roman princes within the precincts, as it were, of the capital; there are &s;everal other places, at &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance from Rome, which have been illu&s;trious in antiquity, and therefore merit a more particular de&s;cription.
<PB N="336" REF="343">
The principal of the&s;e are, Fre&s;cati, Tivoli, and Albano.</P>
<P>Fre&s;cati is about twelve miles Ea&s;t of Rome, and &s;ituated on, or near, the &s;ame &s;pot where the ancient Tu&s;culum &s;tood, and derives its name from the arbours, or tabernacles, built by the inhabitants of Tu&s;culum, when their city was demoli&s;hed in 1191. This charm|ing place is, at pre&s;ent, the &s;ummer re&s;idence of &s;eve|ral per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank, who have not only &s;plen|did palaces and gardens here, but have taken advan|tage of this favourable &s;ituation, among hills, for making very grand water-works, &s;uch as would make a figure even at Ver&s;ailles. Tu&s;culum is often marked, in ancient hi&s;tory, as the &s;cene of many memorable events; it was the birth-place of <HI>Cato</HI> the cen&s;or, the great grandfather of <HI>Cato</HI> of Utica; it was rendered illu&s;trious by the celebrated villa of <HI>Cicero,</HI> to which he frequently retired, and where he compo&s;ed tho&s;e &s;o ju&s;tly admired philo&s;ophical di&s;&s;ertations. This place boa&s;ts likewi&s;e, of having given birth to <HI>Meta&s;tatio;</HI> un|que&s;tionably, the fir&s;t poet in Italy. The town is built on the declivity of a hill, and commands a fine view of the country below, and of the many villas and gardens which clothe and beautify the brow of the mountain.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="344">The principal villa belongs to the <HI>Borghe&s;e</HI> fa|mily, and is &s;ituated on Monte Dracone, a mile from the town; it is &s;o called from the dragon borne by the family of <HI>Borghe&s;e</HI> in their arms. This hou&s;e is reckoned one of the large&s;t in Europe, and has a fine portico con&s;tructed by <HI>Vignoles.</HI></P>
<P>The palace &s;tands on an eminence, and at the end of a very beautiful avenue. At the entrance are the following o&s;tentatious mottos.</P>
<Q><L><HI>The&s;&s;ala quid Tempe, quid quaeris Adonidis hortos</HI></L>
<L><HI>Haec tibi pro cunctis Villa Draconis erit;</HI></L></Q>
<P>That is, <Q><L><HI>"The&s;&s;alian Tempe</HI> and <HI>Adonis'</HI> groves</L>
<L>No more &s;hall charm, but yield to this rece&s;s."</L></Q></P>
<P>And farther on,
<Q><L><HI>He&s;peridum no&s;tris quantum viridaria cedunt,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cu&s;tos e&s;t tanto mitior ore Draco.</HI></L></Q>
<Q><L>"<HI>He&s;perian</HI> groves are far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by the&s;e;</L>
<L>No mon&s;ter guards this rural calm retreat."</L></Q></P>
<P>Some idea may be formed of the largene&s;s of this palace from the number of its windows, which are no le&s;s than three hundred and &s;eventy-four; and, from one of them, the noble owner has a pro&s;pect of part of his own e&s;tate to the amount of fifteen thou&s;and pounds &s;terling a year.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="345">From the terrace is a mo&s;t beautiful view of Rome, and the adjacent country, till the &s;ea bounds the pro&s;|pect on that &s;ide: villages, ruins, and the Lago Ca&s;|tilione, with mountains from another beautiful pro&s;|pect; the <HI>tout en&s;emble</HI> is truly wonderful and delight|ful, uniting all the advantages of a near, with all the grandeur of an exten&s;ive, pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>Here we cannot omit the &s;tory of an unfortunate mother and daughter of the family of <HI>Cenci,</HI> who&s;e portraits are &s;hewn in one of the&s;e apartments. The father of the latter was &s;uch an abandoned wretch, that he could not refrain from acts of brutal, and even unnatural lu&s;t with his wife, in his daughter's pre&s;ence, and made &s;everal violent attempts on <HI>her</HI> per&s;on al&s;o. To put a period to &s;uch indignities, &s;he had recour&s;e to a mo&s;t de&s;perate attempt, to which her father's hor|rid villany prompted her. She concealed two a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins in her chamber, who were to murder her father in his &s;leep; but, when the dreadful moment came, the two villains were &s;eized with fear, or &s;udden remor&s;e, and &s;hewed a reluctance to perpetrate the murder. Upon this the daughter, in a tran&s;port of rage, &s;natched a &s;tiletto from the hands of one of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and &s;tabbed her father as he &s;lept, who expired amid&s;t a deluge of blood. This dreadful cata&s;trophe happened in the time of <HI>Paul</HI> V. and the mother and brother being privy to the de&s;ign, they were all three beheaded
<PB N="339" REF="346">
before the ca&s;tle of S. Angelo. The Pope &s;hewed them no other favour, notwith&s;tanding they were of a noble family, than that of ordering &s;ome guns to be fired, at the time of their execution, from the ca&s;tle of S. <HI>Angelo,</HI> as a &s;ignal for his Holine&s;s to pronounce a benediction in their behalf. The daughter died with great re&s;olution; and her youth and beauty drew a flood of tears from the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>The villa <HI>Aldobrandini</HI> is al&s;o remarkable for its fine &s;ituation, exten&s;ive gardens, airy terraces, its grottos and water-works. The&s;e form a kind of theatre; and a bra&s;s globe, &s;upported on the &s;houlders of <HI>Atlas,</HI> ejects water on all &s;ides. Near this &s;tatue are a lion and a tyger fighting; and, the water i&s;&s;uing from the mouth and no&s;trils of the former, exactly imitates the &s;narling of that animal when enraged. The column of water, in the center of the fountain, ri&s;es to the height of &s;eventy-four <HI>palmi,</HI> and is at|tended with a noi&s;e like the whizzing of &s;ky-rockets. Here is al&s;o a <HI>Francis,</HI> or <HI>Polypheme,</HI> playing on one of the ancient pa&s;toral pipes, and a Centaur blowing a horn, which is &s;aid to be heard four Italian miles. In an arched hall, is al&s;o to be &s;een Mount Parna&s;&s;us, with <HI>Apollo,</HI> the Mu&s;es, and <HI>Pega&s;us;</HI> the mu&s;ic of the choir proceeds from an artificial cuckow, and an organ with a variety of &s;tops, put in play by water, as is another place before the theatre. The keys of
<PB N="340" REF="347">
the&s;e in&s;truments are moved by bra&s;s pins, fixed in a cylinder, which turns on its axis by means of a water-mill. Near Mount Parna&s;&s;us &s;tand the &s;tatues of <HI>Co|rinna</HI> and <HI>Sappho;</HI> and, on the walls, <HI>Apollo</HI>'s chief ad|ventures are painted in fre&s;co. Over the door is this di&s;tich:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>Huc ego migravi Mu&s;is comitatus,</HI> Apollo,</L>
<L><HI>Hic</HI> Delphi, <HI>hic</HI> Helicon, <HI>hic mihi</HI> Delos <HI>erit.</HI></L>

<L>And all our famous haunts &s;o fam'd of old."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>This curious &s;aloon is paved with fine &s;mall &s;tones curiou&s;ly arranged; and, in the center of the pave|ment is a hole, over which a light globe, or ball, is kept in a perfect equilibrium, at the di&s;tance of a &s;pan from the floor, only by the impetus of the air, forced up by water through the hole. The ca&s;cade con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ixty-five &s;teps, and on both &s;ides are tortoi&s;es, dol|phins, and other aquatic animals, cut in &s;tone, and &s;pouting water at each other. In the garden, not far from the ca&s;cade, is a wilderne&s;s, with &s;everal &s;hady, narrow walks in it.</P>
<P>The villa <HI>Conti</HI> is worth &s;eeing, on account of its garden and water-works, and particularly for the an|cient
<PB N="341" REF="348">
remains of eighteen vaulted buildings, &s;aid to have formed part of the <HI>menagerie</HI> of <HI>Lucullus.</HI></P>
<P>The ruins of the ancient town of Tu&s;culum are to be traced above a villa belonging to the Je&s;uits, called the grottos of <HI>Cicero;</HI> but, it is by no means certain that the&s;e ve&s;tiges made part of his villa.</P>
<P>Fre&s;cati is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is &s;uffragan of Rome, and it is u&s;ually held by one of the &s;ix elde&s;t cardinals. At pre&s;ent, it belongs to the cardinal of York, who pa&s;&s;es the greate&s;t part of his time in the duties and ceremonies of a religion, of who&s;e truth he &s;eems to have the fulle&s;t conviction.</P>
<P>Near the bottom of the eminence, on which Tivoli &s;tands, are the ruins of the va&s;t and magnificent villa, built by the Emperor <HI>Adrian.</HI> The&s;e remains cover a large extent of ground. Several country hou&s;es have been built upon them, and the greater number of the fine&s;t antiques in the Roman collections have been found here. Various authors agree, that this villa was in length three miles; and in breadth, a fifth of that &s;pace. Here &s;till remain ve&s;tiges of co|lonades, temples, aqueducts, &amp;c. On part of the gardens is built a religious hou&s;e for the Je&s;uits; they are &s;aid to have been laid out, formerly, in the mo&s;t beautiful repre&s;entation of the Ely&s;ian fields, contra&s;ted
<PB N="342" REF="349">
with the regions of <HI>Pluto.</HI> Much more may be &s;aid of this villa, even in its pre&s;ent ruined &s;tate; but, what it has been, may be gathered from a variety of ancient authors. Suffice it to &s;ay, that the utmo&s;t efforts of the arts and &s;ciences were exhau&s;ted in the improvement of a &s;pot, kind and beautiful by nature.</P>
<P>A wet and mar&s;hy piece of ground, which was partly under water, and had been an immen&s;e ba&s;on in front of this villa, is rented by a <HI>M. Hamilton,</HI> an ingenious Engli&s;h arti&s;t, who keeps a great number of men at work upon it, and has &s;ucceeded, &s;o far as he has gone, in draining it, with great expence and labour. He very &s;en&s;ibly fixed on this &s;pot, concluding, that many valuable antiques might have been thrown into the water, to pre&s;erve them from the barbarous fury of tho&s;e who demoli&s;hed this &s;uperb edifice; and has already found a great number of curious articles, which will yield him an ample indemnification.</P>
<P>Tivoli is about fifteen miles di&s;tant from Fre&s;cati, and nearly the &s;ame di&s;tance from Rome, and &s;ituated on a hill. It is the ancient Tibur, and &s;aid to have been built by the Greeks. The town it&s;elf is a wretched place, and made more di&s;agreeable by a great number of forges. The inhabitants po&s;itively affirm, this little town to have been built &s;ix hundred and

forty years before the city of Rome; and round its arms &s;till retain the ancient motto, <HI>&s;uperbum Tibur,</HI> "proud Tibur." The cathedral is built upon the the ruins of the temple of <HI>Hercules;</HI> but the mo&s;t re|markable antiquity here is the temple of the Sibyl: the beautiful architecture, and fine proportions of this &s;mall edifice, &s;trike the eye at fir&s;t view; its form is mo&s;t elegant, its &s;culpture perfect and peculiary grace|ful. The lines of beauty, &s;o in&s;i&s;ted upon by <HI>Hogarth,</HI> are to be traced in all the ornaments of this building. Its &s;ituation is on the brow of a hill; on one &s;ide ap|pears the town, and in front the great ca&s;cade. This beautiful little temple has been &s;o accurately de&s;cribed by <HI>Palladio, Vitruvius,</HI> and other architects, that it is &s;urpri&s;ing it has not been copied in &s;ome of the fine gardens in England. The hill, on which this temple &s;tands, affords not only a charming pro&s;pect of the ca&s;cade, but of the &s;pots where the &s;eats of <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Catullus</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;tood. The violence of the fall, or cataract, of the river Teverone, anciently the Anio, down the precipice, turns the water en|tirely to foam, and has con&s;iderably excavated the rocks beneath. About half a league farther up the hill, is another water-fall; but neither of them is to be compared to the ca&s;cade formed by the Rhine, near Schaffhau&s;in, or of the Velino, in the di&s;trict of Terni.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="352">The ca&s;cade of Terni is formed by the fall of the river Velino, which <HI>Virgil</HI> mentions in the &s;eventh Aeneid, <HI>Ro&s;ea rura Velini.</HI> The channel of this river lies very high, and is &s;haded on all &s;ides by a green fore&s;t, made up of &s;everal kinds of trees, that pre&s;erve their verdure all the year. The neighbouring moun|tains are &s;erved with them; and, by rea&s;on of their height, are more expo&s;ed to the dews, and drizzling rains, than any of the adjacent parts, which gives occa|&s;ion to <HI>Virgil's Ro&s;ea rura</HI> (dewy countries). The river runs extremely rapid before its fall, and ru&s;hes down a precipice of a hundred yards high; it throws it&s;elf into the hollow of a rock, which, probably, has been worn by &s;uch a con&s;tant fall of water. It is im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee the bottom on which it breaks, for the thickne&s;s of the mi&s;t that ri&s;es from it, which looks at a di&s;tance like clouds of &s;moke, a&s;cending from &s;ome va&s;t furnace, and di&s;tils in perpetual rains on all the places that lie near it. The river Velino, after hav|ing found its way out from among the rocks, runs into the river Nera. [<HI>See the Plate. The figures on the fore-ground are in the co&s;tume, or dre&s;s of the country.</HI></P>
<P>After having pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e falls, this river, which takes its ri&s;e in the Appenines, fifty miles above Tivoli, lo&s;es it&s;elf in the Tibur.</P>

<P><PB N="345" REF="354">Be&s;ides the ca&s;cade and the Sibyl's temple, Tivoli has to boa&s;t of the villa <HI>E&s;ten&s;e,</HI> which is &s;aid to have co&s;t the family, who&s;e name it bears, three millions of crowns; yet this fine hou&s;e is going to decay as fa&s;t as time can effect it. This palace has been much ad|mired for its architecture, &s;culpture, paintings, gar|dens, and water-works. Mo&s;t of the water-works are &s;till kept up; for, being ea&s;ily &s;upplied from the river Anio, they are not very chargeable. The large ba&s;on, before the palace, furni&s;hes a great quantity of water. Near this ba&s;on, is a very long row of &s;ome hundreds of eagles, pyramids, ba&s;es, and other figures, cut in &s;tone, and fixed on pede&s;tals, with bas-reliefs of &s;tories taken from <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Metamorpho&s;es, and water is ejected from all of them. This row of figures, being &s;everal hundred paces in length, is a very elegant or|nament; and, at the end, &s;tands a &s;hip with its ma&s;ts and rigging, as it were, engaged and vigorou&s;ly de|fending it&s;elf, by ejecting water from all parts. On an adjoining eminence, is a repre&s;entation of ancient Rome, with its temples, theatres, obeli&s;ks, baths, columns, triumphal arches and aqueducts. The Gi|rondola, or dragon fountain, throws up a va&s;t column of water, to the height of twenty <HI>palmi.</HI> The water-organ, is al&s;o a curious piece of work; and the deep ca&s;cade is in a good ta&s;te. Upon the whole, the water-works at Tivoli &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e at Fre&s;cati; but the latter afford a more agreeable pro&s;pect; for
<PB N="346" REF="355">
Tivoli lies on the brow of a chain of hills, by which great part of its pro&s;pect is intercepted on one &s;ide.</P>
<P>This was a populous and flouri&s;hing town in re|moter antiquity; but, it appears to have been thinly inhabited in the reign of <HI>Augu&s;tus. Horace,</HI> in an epi&s;tle to <HI>Mecaenas,</HI> &s;ays,
<Q><L>Parvum parva decent. Mihi jam non Regia Roma,</L>
<L>Sed vacuum Tibur placet.</L></Q></P>
<P>That is, "Little things are adapted to little men. It is not royal Rome that plea&s;es me now, but the empty Tibur."</P>
<P>Though the town it&s;elf was not populous, the beauty of the &s;ituation, and whole&s;omene&s;s of the air, prompted great numbers of illu&s;trious Romans, both before the final de&s;truction of the republic, and afterwards, in <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s time, to build country-hou&s;es in the neigh|bourhood. <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> had a villa here, which he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling, to defray the ex|pence of the public &s;hews and games he exhibited to the people during his Aedile&s;hip. <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;ays, that his liberality and magnificence, on this occa&s;ion, ob|&s;cured the glory of all who had preceded him in the office, and gained the hearts of the people to &s;uch a degree; that they were ready to invent new offices,
<PB N="347" REF="356">
and new honours for him. He then laid the foun|dation of that power and popularity, which enabled him, in the end, to overturn the con&s;titution of his country. <HI>Caius Ca&s;&s;ius</HI> had al&s;o a country hou&s;e here; where <HI>Marcus Brutus</HI> and he are &s;aid to have had fre|quent meetings, and to have formed the plan, which terminated the ambition of <HI>Cae&s;ar;</HI> and again offered Rome that freedom, which &s;he had not the virtue to accept. Here al&s;o, was the villa of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s in life aro&s;e at the field of <HI>Philippi,</HI> from which he fled; was confirmed by the death of the mo&s;t vir|tuous citizens of Rome; and who, without the talents, reaped the fruits of the labour, and va&s;t projects of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar. Lepidus</HI> the triumvir, <HI>Cecilius Metellus, Quintillius Varus,</HI> the poets <HI>Catullus</HI> and <HI>Propertius,</HI> and other di&s;tingui&s;hed Romans, had villas in this town, or its environs, and the &s;pots are &s;hewn on which they &s;tood; but nothing renders Tibur &s;o intere&s;ting, as the frequent mention which <HI>Horace</HI> makes of it in his writings. His great patron and friend <HI>Mecoenas</HI> had a villa here, the ruins of which are to be &s;een on the South bank of the Anio; and, it was pretty generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that the poet's own hou&s;e and farm were very near it, and immediately without the walls of Tibur; but it has been of late a&s;&s;erted, with great pro|bability, that <HI>Horace</HI>'s farm was &s;ituated nine miles above that of <HI>Mecoenas</HI>'s, at the &s;ide of a &s;tream, called Licenza, formerly Digentia, near the hill of Lucre|tilis,
<PB N="348" REF="357">
in the country of the ancient Sabines. Tho&s;e who hold this opinion &s;ay, that when <HI>Horace</HI> talks of Tibur, he alludes to the villa of <HI>Mecoenas;</HI> but, when he mentions Digentia, or Lucretilis, his own hou&s;e and farm are to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>But, whether the poet's hou&s;e and farm were near the town of Tibur, or at a di&s;tance from it; his wri|tings &s;ufficiently &s;hew, that he &s;pent much of his time there; and, it is probable, that he compo&s;ed great part of his works in that favourable retreat. This he, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, declares in that fine ode addre&s;&s;ed to <HI>Julius Antoninus;</HI> the &s;ame whom <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> fir&s;t par|doned, and afterwards put privately to death, on ac|count of an intrigue, into which he was &s;educed by the abandoned <HI>Julia,</HI> the daughter of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> If Tivoli had nothing el&s;e to recommend it, but its being &s;o often &s;ung by the mo&s;t elegant of the poets, and its having been the re&s;idence of &s;o many illu&s;trious men, the&s;e circum&s;tances alone would render it worthy the attention of travellers.</P>
<P>On the road from Rome to Tivoli, about three miles from the latter, &s;trangers are de&s;ired to vi&s;it a kind of lake, called Solfatara, formerly Lacus Albulus, and there &s;hewn certain &s;ub&s;tances, to which they give the name of floating i&s;lands. They are nothing more than bunches of bullru&s;hes, &s;pringing from a thin &s;oil,

formed by du&s;t and &s;and blown from the adjacent ground, and glued together by the bitumen, which &s;wims on the &s;urface of this lake, and the &s;ulphur with which its waters are impregnated. Some of the&s;e i&s;lands are twelve or fifteen yards in length; the &s;oil &s;ufficiently &s;trong to bear five or &s;ix people; who, by the means of a pole, may move to different parts of the lake, as if they were in a boat. This lake empties it&s;elf by a whiti&s;h, muddy &s;tream in the Teve|rone; a vapour, of a &s;ulphureous &s;mell, ari&s;ing from it as it flows. The ground near this rivulet, as al&s;o around the borders of the lake, re&s;ounds as if it were hollow, when a hor&s;e gallops over it. The water of this lake has the &s;ingular quality of covering every &s;ub&s;tance which it touches, with a hard &s;tony matter. On throwing a bundle of &s;mall &s;ticks, or &s;hrubs into it, they will, in a few days, be covered with a white cru&s;t; but what &s;eems &s;till more extraordinary, this encru&s;ting quality is not &s;o &s;trong in the lake it&s;elf, as in the canal, or little rivulet that runs from it; and the further the water has flowed from the lake, till it is quite lo&s;t in the Anio, the &s;tronger is this quality.

<P>The road from Fre&s;cati to Rome, by Gen&s;ano, Ma|rino, La Riccia, and Ca&s;tel Gondolfo, is delightful. All the villages, and villas, communicate with each other, by fine walks, and avenues of lofty trees; who&s;e intermingling branches form a continual &s;hade for the traveller. Ca&s;tel Gondolfo is a little village, near the lake of Albano; on one extremity of which is a ca&s;tle, belonging to his Holine&s;s, from which the vil|lage takes its name. There is nothing remarkably fine in this villa, except its &s;ituation. Near the village is likewi&s;e the villa Barberini; within the gardens of which are the ruins of an immen&s;e palace, built by the Emperor <HI>Domitian.</HI> There is a charming walk, about a mile in length, along the &s;ide of the lake, from Ca&s;tel Gondolfo, to the town of Albano. The lake of Al|bano is an oval piece of water, about &s;even or eight miles in circumference, who&s;e margin is finely adorned with groves and trees of various verdures, beautifully reflected from the lake; and which, with the &s;urround|ing hills, and the Ca&s;tel Gondolfo, which crowns one of them, forms a fine picture&s;que appearance.</P>

the &s;weet hills and vallies of Italy, her features are brought nearer the eye, are fully &s;een and under|&s;tood, and appear in all the bloom of rural loveline&s;s. Tivoli, Albano, and Fre&s;cati, therefore, are the fa|vourite abodes of the land&s;cape-painters, who travel into this country for improvement; and, in the opinion of &s;ome, the&s;e delightful villages furni&s;h &s;tudies better, to the powers of their art, than even Switzerland it|&s;elf. Nothing can &s;urpa&s;s the admirable a&s;&s;emblage of hills, meadows, lakes, ca&s;cades, gardens, ruins, groves, and terraces; which charm the eye in wandering amid the &s;hades of Fre&s;cati and Albano, appearing in new beauty as they are viewed from different points, and captivating the beholder with endle&s;s variety.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t commanding view is from the garden of a convent of capuchins, at no great di&s;tance from Albano. Directly in front is the lake, with the moun|tains and woods which &s;urround it, and the ca&s;tle of Gondolfo; on one hand is Fre&s;cati, with all its villas; on the other, the towns of Albano, La Riccia, and Gen&s;ano; beyond the&s;e an uninterrupted view of the Campagna, with St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s church, and the city of Rome in the middle; the whole pro&s;pect being bounded by the hills of Tivoli, the Appenines, and the Mediterranean.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="361">One of the &s;cenes, generally taken by mo&s;t painters, is a view near the fountain, between Lericci and Al|bano, about twenty-five miles on the road from Rome to Naples, with a di&s;tant pro&s;pect of part of the Cam|pagnia, and the Mediterranean. The figures are in the dre&s;s of the country. N. B. The ancient Via Ap|pia, from Rome to Brundu&s;ium, went clo&s;e to this road, of which there are now &s;ome remains. <HI>[See the Plate.]</HI></P>
<P>While we were contemplating, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> all the&s;e objects with plea&s;ure and admiration, an Engli&s;h gen|tleman ob&s;erving, that there was not a pro&s;pect equal to it in all France or Germany, and not many &s;uperior even in England, gave occa&s;ion to the following hu|mourous dialogue, between this latter, and a lively old gentleman from Scotland, a man of worth, but no antiquarian; and, indeed, no admirer of any thing ancient or modern, which had not &s;ome relation to his native country. "That I well believe," replied the Caledonian; "but, if I had you in Scotland, I could &s;hew you &s;everal, with which this is by no means to be compared." "Indeed! Pray in what part of Scotland are they to be &s;een?" "I pre&s;ume you never was at the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, Sir?" "Never," "Did you ever &s;ee Lock Lomond, Sir?" "I never did." "I &s;uppo&s;e I need not a&s;k, whether you have ever been in Aberdeen&s;hire, or the Highlands, or &mdash;," "I mu&s;t confe&s;s once for all," interrupted

the Engli&s;hman, "that I have the misfortune never to have &s;een any part of Scotland." "Then I am not &s;urprized," &s;aid the Scot, taking a large pinch of &s;nuff, "that you think this is the fine&s;t view you ever &s;aw." "I pre&s;ume, you think tho&s;e in Scot|land a great deal finer?" "A very great deal in|deed, Sir; why, that lake for example, is a pretty thing enough; I dare &s;wear, many an Engli&s;h noble|man would give a good deal to have &s;uch another before his hou&s;e; but, Loch Lomond, is thirty miles in length, Sir! There are above twenty i&s;lands in it, Sir! That is a lake for you. As for their de&s;ert of a Campagna, as they call it, no man who has eyes in his head, Sir, will compare the Campagna of Rome, to the fertile valley of Sterling, with the Forth, the mo&s;t beautiful river in Europe twining through it." "Do you really in your con&s;cience imagine," &s;aid the Eng|li&s;hman, "that the Forth is a finer river than the Thames?" "The Thames!" exclaimed the North Briton; "why, my dear Sir, the Thames at London is a mere gutter, in compari&s;on of the Frith of Forth at Edinburgh." "I &s;uppo&s;e then," &s;aid the Engli&s;h|man recovering him&s;elf, "you do not approve of the view from Wind&s;or ca&s;tle?" "I a&s;k your pardon," replied the other, "I approve of it very much; it is an exceeding pretty kind of a pro&s;pect; the country appears from it, as agreeable to the &s;ight as any plain flat country, crowded by trees, and inter&s;ected by in|clo&s;ures,

can well do; but, I own, I am of opinion, that mere fertile woods, rivers, and meadows, can never of them&s;elves perfectly &s;atisfy the eye." "You imagine, no doubt," &s;aid the Engli&s;hman, "that a few heath-covered mountains and rocks embelli&s;h a country very much?" "I am preci&s;ely of that opi|nion," &s;aid the Scot; "and you may as &s;oon con|vince me, that a woman may be completely beautiful with fine eyes, good teeth, and a fine complexion, though &s;he &s;hould not have a no&s;e on her face, as that a land&s;cape or country, can be completely beautiful without a mountain." "Well, but here are mountains enough," re&s;umed the other; "look around you." "Mountains!" cried the Caledonian, "very pretty mountains, truly! They call that Ca&s;tel Gondolfo of theirs, a ca&s;tle too, and a palace, for&s;ooth! but, does that make it a re&s;idence fit for a prince?" "Why, upon my word, I do not think it much ami&s;s," &s;aid the other; "it looks full as well as the palace of St. <HI>James</HI>'s." The palace of St. <HI>James,</HI>" exclaimed the Scot, "is a &s;candal to the nation; it is both a &s;hame and a &s;in, that &s;o great a monarch as the King of Scotland, England, and Ire|land, with his royal con&s;ort, and their large family of &s;mall children, &s;hould live in a &s;habby old cloi&s;ter, hardly good enough for monks.

"I have been told, you do not excel in tho&s;e." "But we excel in gardeners," replied the other, "which are as much preferable as the creator is preferable to the created." "I am &s;urprized, however, that in a country like yours," rejoined the South Briton, "where there are &s;o many creators, &s;o very few fruit-gardens &s;hould be created." "Why, Sir, it is not to be expected," &s;aid the Scotchman, "that any one country &s;hould excel in every thing. Some enjoy a climate more favourable for peaches, vines, and nec|tarines; but, by God, Sir, no country on earth pro|duces better men and women than Scotland." "I dare &s;ay none does," replied the other. "So, as France excels in wine, England in wool, and oxen; Arabia in hor&s;es, and other countries in animals; you imagine Scotland excels all others in the human &s;pe|cies." "What I &s;aid, Sir, was, that the human &s;pecies in no country excel tho&s;e of Scotland; and that I a&s;&s;ert again, and will maintain, Sir, to my la&s;t ga&s;p." "I do not intend to deny it," &s;aid the Engli&s;h|man; "but you will permit me to ob&s;erve, that men being its &s;taple commodity, it mu&s;t be owned that Scotland carries on a bri&s;k trade, for I know no coun|try that has a greater <HI>exportation;</HI> for you will find Scotchmen in all countries of the world." "So much the better for all the countries of the world," &s;aid the Scotchman, "for every body knows that the Scotch cultivate and improve the arts and &s;ciences wherever
<PB N="356" REF="366">
they go." "They certainly improve their own for|tune wherever they go," rejoined the other: "like their gardeners, though they can create little or nothing at home, they often create very good fortunes in other countries; and this is one rea&s;on of our hav|ing the plea&s;ure of &s;o much of their country in Lon|don." "Whether it affords you plea&s;ure or not, Sir, nothing can be more certain," replied the Scot in the mo&s;t &s;erious tone, "than that you may <HI>improve</HI> very much by their company and example. But there are various rea&s;ons," continued he, "for &s;o many of our country &s;ojourning in London. The &s;eat of govern|ment is there; the King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as of Eng|land, re&s;ides there; the Scotch nobility and gentry, have as good a right to be near the per&s;on of their &s;overeign, as the Engli&s;h; and you mu&s;t allow, that if &s;ome Scotchmen make fortunes in England, many of our be&s;t e&s;tates are al&s;o &s;pent there. But you mean to &s;ay, that the Scotch, in general, are poor, in com|pari&s;on of the Engli&s;h. This we do not deny, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly forget, as your countrymen refre&s;h our memories with it &s;o often. We all allow, there|fore, that you have this advantage over us; and the Per&s;ians had the &s;ame over the Macedonians, at the battle of Arbela. But, whether Scotland be poor or rich, tho&s;e Scots who &s;ettle in England mu&s;t carry in|du&s;try, talents, or wealth with them, otherwi&s;e they will &s;tarve there as well as el&s;ewhere; and, when one

And let me tell you, Sir, upon the whole, the advantages, which England derives from the union, are manife&s;t and manifold." "I cannot &s;ay," replied the Engli&s;hman, "that I have thought much on the &s;ub|ject; but I &s;hall be obliged to you, if you will enu|merate a few of them." "In the fir&s;t place," re|&s;umed the Scot, "has &s;he not greatly increa&s;ed in wealth &s;ince that time?" "She has &s;o," replied the other, &s;miling, "and I never knew the real cau&s;e before." "In the next place, has &s;he not acquired a million and a half of &s;ubjects, who, otherwi&s;e, would have been her enemies? For this, and other rea|&s;ons, they are equivalent to three millions. In the third place, has &s;he not acquired &s;ecurity, without which, riches are of no value? There is no door open now, Sir, by which the French can enter into your country. They dare as &s;oon be damned as attempt to invade Scotland; &s;o, if you can only defend your own coa&s;t, there is no fear of you; but, without a perfect union with Scotland, England could not enjoy the principal benefit &s;he derives from her in&s;ular &s;itu|ation." "Not till Scotland &s;hall be &s;ubdued," &s;aid the Engli&s;hman. "Subdued!" repeated the a&s;|toni&s;hed Scot; "let me tell you, Sir, that is a very &s;trange hypothe&s;is; the fruitle&s;s attempts of many cen|turies, might have taught you that the thing is impo&s;|&s;ible;

and, if you are conver&s;ant in hi&s;tory, you will find, that after the decline of the Roman empire, the cour&s;e of conque&s;t was from North to South." "You mean," &s;aid the South Briton, "that Scotland would have conquered England." "Sir," replied the other, "I think the Engli&s;h as brave a nation as ever exi&s;ted, and therefore I will not &s;ay the Scotch are braver; far le&s;s &s;hall I a&s;&s;ert, that they, con&s;i&s;ting of only a fifth part of the number, could &s;ubdue the Engli&s;h; but I am &s;ure, that rather than &s;ubmit they would try; and you will admit, that the trial would be no advan|tage to either country." "Although I am fully con|vinced," &s;aid the Engli&s;hman, "how the experiment would end, I &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ee it made, particu|larly at this time." "Yet, Sir," rejoined the Scot, "there are people of your country as I am told, who, even at this time, endeavour to exa&s;perate the minds of the inhabitants, of one part of Great Britain again&s;t the natives of the other, and to create di&s;&s;en&s;ions between two countries, who&s;e mutual &s;afety depends on their good agreement."

<P>THERE are no theatrical entertainments permit|ted in Rome, except during the carnival; but, they are then attended with a degree of ardour un|known in capitals, who&s;e inhabitants are under no &s;uch re&s;traint. Every kind of amu&s;ement, indeed, in this gay &s;ea&s;on, is followed with the greate&s;t eagerne&s;s. The natural gravity of the Roman citizens is changed into a mirthful vivacity; and the &s;erious &s;ombre city of Rome exceeds Paris it&s;elf, in &s;prightline&s;s and gaiety. This &s;pirit &s;eems gradually to augment, from its commencement; and is at its height in the la&s;t of the &s;ix weeks which comprehend the carnival. The citizens then appear in the &s;treets, ma&s;ked, in the cha|racters of harlequins, pantaloons, punchinellos, and all
<PB N="360" REF="370">
the fanta&s;tic variety of a ma&s;querade. This humour &s;preads to men, women, and children; de&s;cends to the lowe&s;t ranks, and becomes univer&s;al. Even tho&s;e who put on no ma&s;ks, and have no de&s;ire to remain unknown, reject their u&s;ual clothes, and a&s;&s;ume &s;ome whim&s;ical dre&s;s. The coachmen, who are placed in a more con&s;picuous point of view than others of the &s;ame rank in life, and who are perfectly known by the carriages they drive, generally affect &s;ome ridiculous di&s;gui&s;e; many of them a&s;&s;ume a woman's dre&s;s, and have their faces painted, and adorned with patches. However dull the&s;e fellows may be, when in breeches, they are, in petticoats con&s;idered as the plea&s;ante&s;t men in the world, and excite much laughter in every &s;treet in which they appear.</P>
<P>The &s;treet called the Cor&s;o is the great &s;cene of all the&s;e ma&s;querades. It is crouded every night with people of all conditions: tho&s;e of rank come in coaches, or in open carriages made on purpo&s;e. A kind of civil war is carried on by the company as they pa&s;s each other. The greate&s;t mark of attention, people can &s;hew their friends and acquaintance, is to throw a handful of little white balls, re&s;embling &s;ugar-plumbs, in their faces; and, if they are not deficient in politene&s;s, they will in&s;tantly return the compli|ment. All who wi&s;h to make a figure in the cor&s;o, come well provided with this kind of ammunition.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="371">Sometimes two or three open carriages on a &s;ide, with five or &s;ix per&s;ons of both &s;exes in each, draw up oppo&s;ite to each other, and fight a pitched battle. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, the combatants are provided with whole bags full of the &s;mall &s;hot above-mentioned; which they throw at each other with much apparent fury, till their ammunition is exhau&s;ted, and the field of battle is as white as &s;now.</P>
<P>The peculiar dre&s;&s;es of every nation of the globe, and of every profe&s;&s;ion, be&s;ides all the fanta&s;tic cha|racters, u&s;ual at ma&s;querades, are to be &s;een on the cor&s;o. Tho&s;e of harlequin and pantaloon are in great vogue among the men. The citizens wives and daughters generally affect the pomp of women of quality; while their brothers, or other relations, ap|pear as train-bearers and attendants. In general they &s;eem to delight in characters the mo&s;t remote from their own. Young people a&s;&s;ume the long beard; tottering &s;tep, and other concomitants of old age; the aged chu&s;e the bib and rattle of childhood; and the women of quality, and women of the town, appear in the characters of country maidens, nuns, and ve&s;tal virgins. All endeavour to &s;upport the a&s;&s;umed cha|racter to the be&s;t of their ability; but none &s;ucceed &s;o well as tho&s;e who repre&s;ent children.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="372">Towards the du&s;k of the evening, the hor&s;e-race takes place. As &s;oon as this is announced, the coaches, cabriolets, triumphal cars, and carriages of every kind, are drawn up and line the &s;treet, leaving a &s;pace in the middle for the racers to pa&s;s. The&s;e are five or &s;ix hor&s;es trained on purpo&s;e for this di|ver&s;ion; they are drawn up a-brea&s;t in the Piazza del Popolo, exactly where the cor&s;o begins. Certain balls, as at Florence, with little &s;harp &s;pikes, are hung along their &s;ides, which &s;erve to &s;pur them on. As &s;oon as they begin to run, the&s;e animals, by their im|patience to be gone, &s;hew, that they under&s;tand what is required of them, and that they take as much plea|&s;ure as the &s;pectators in the &s;port. A broad piece of canvas, &s;pread acro&s;s the entrance of the &s;treet, pre|vents them from &s;tarting too &s;oon: the dropping that canvas is the &s;ignal for the race to begin. The hor&s;es fly off together, and, without riders, exert them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t; impelled by emulation, the &s;houts of the populace, and the &s;purs above-mentioned. They run the whole length of the cor&s;o; and the proprietor of the victor is rewarded by a certain quantity of fine &s;carlet, or purple cloth, which is always furni&s;hed by the Jews.</P>
<P>This diver&s;ion, &s;uch as it is, &s;eems highly enter|taining to the Roman populace; though it appears a a mighty fooli&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s in the eyes of Engli&s;hmen.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="373">Ma&s;king and hor&s;e-races are confined to the la&s;t eight days; but there are theatrical entertainments of various kinds, during the whole &s;ix weeks of the car|nival. The &s;erious opera is mo&s;t frequented by people of fa&s;hion, who generally take boxes for the whole &s;ea&s;on. The opera, with which this theatre opened, was received with applau&s;e, though the mu&s;ic only was new. The Italians do not always think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to compo&s;e new works, for what is called a new opera; they often &s;atisfy them&s;elves with new mu&s;ic, to the affecting dramas of <HI>Meta&s;ta&s;io.</HI> The audience, here, &s;eem to lend a more profound and continued attention to the mu&s;ic, than at Venice. This is probably owing to the entertainment being a greater rarity in the one city, than in the other; for I could perceive, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> that people of fa&s;hion, who came every night; began, after the opera had been re|peated &s;everal times, to abate in their attention, to re|ceive vi&s;itors in their boxes, and to li&s;ten only when &s;ome favourite airs were &s;inging; whereas, the au|dience in the pit uniformly pre&s;erved the mo&s;t perfect &s;ilence; which was only interrupted by gentle mur|murs of plea&s;ure from a few individuals, or an univer|&s;al bur&s;t of applau&s;e from the whole a&s;&s;embly. The &s;en&s;ibility of &s;ome of the audience gave me an idea of the power of &s;ounds; which the dullne&s;s of my own auditory nerves could never have conveyed to my mind. At certain airs, &s;ilent enjoyment was expre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="364" REF="374">
in every countenance; at others, the hands were cla&s;ped together, the eyes half &s;hut, and the breath drawn in with a prolonged &s;igh, as if the &s;oul was ex|piring in a torrent of delight. One young woman in the pit called out, <HI>O dio, dove &s;ono; che piacer via caccia l'alma?</HI> "Oh God, where am I! what plea|&s;ure ravi&s;hes my &s;oul?</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t night of the opera, after one of the&s;e favourite airs, an univer&s;al &s;hout of applau&s;e took place, intermingled with demands that the compo&s;er of the mu&s;ic &s;hould appear. <HI>Il mae&s;tro! il mae&s;tro!</HI> re&s;ounded from every corner of the hou&s;e. He was pre&s;ent and led the band of mu&s;ic, and was obliged to &s;tand on the bench; where he continued bowing to the &s;pectators, till they were tired of applauding him. One per&s;on in the pit, who had di&s;played great &s;igns of &s;atisfaction from the beginning of the performance, cried out, "He de&s;erves to be made chief mu&s;ician to the virgin, and to lead a choir of angels." This expre&s;&s;ion would be thought &s;trong in any country, but it has peculiar energy here, where it is a popular opinion, that the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> is very fond, and an excellent judge, of mu&s;ic. I received this informa|tion on Chri&s;tmas morning, when I was looking at two poor Calabrian pipers, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> doing their utmo&s;t to plea&s;e her, and the infant in her arms. They played for a full hour to one of her images which
<PB N="365" REF="375">
&s;tands at the corner of a &s;treet. All the other &s;tatues of the virgin, placed in the &s;treets, are &s;erenaded in the &s;ame manner every Chri&s;tmas morning. On en|quiry into the meaning of that ceremony, I was told the above-mentioned circum&s;tance. My informer was a pilgrim, who &s;tood li&s;tening with great devo|tion to the pipers. He told me, at the &s;ame time, that the virgin's ta&s;te was too refined to have much &s;atis|faction in the performance of the&s;e poor Calabrians, which was chiefly intended for the infant; and he de&s;ired me to remark, that the tunes were plain, &s;im|ple, and &s;uch as might naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed agreeable to the ear of a child at his time of life.</P>
<P>Though the &s;erious opera is in the highe&s;t e&s;tima|tion, and more regularly attended by people of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion; yet, the opera buffon, or burlettas, are not entirely neglected even by them, and are crowded every night by the middle and lower cla&s;&s;es. Some admired &s;ingers have performed the&s;e during the car|nival; and the mu&s;ical compo&s;ers have rendered them highly plea&s;ing to the general ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The prohibition of female performers renders the amu&s;ement, of the Roman theatre, very in&s;ipid to foreigners. The natural &s;weetne&s;s of the female voice is ill &s;upplied by the artificial trills of wretched ca&s;tratos; and the awkward agility of robu&s;t &s;inewy
<PB N="366" REF="376">
fellows, dre&s;&s;ed in women's clothes, is a mo&s;t deplo|rable &s;ub&s;titute for the graceful movements of elegant female dancers. This horrid practice, which is en|couraged by their manner of &s;upplying the place of female fingers, is a greater outrage on religion and mo|rality, than can be produced by the evils which their prohibition is intended to prevent. So far from its being po&s;&s;ible to believe that purity of &s;entiment will be pre&s;erved, by bringing eunuchs on the &s;tage, it is more than probable that it has a different effect.</P>
<P>All civil and religious ceremonies, attended with pomp and &s;plendor at Rome, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of functions, and are no mean &s;ucceda|neum to the &s;hows, for which the Roman people had &s;uch a rage.</P>
<P>Of all the&s;e functions, the mo&s;t brilliant is that of the <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;o,</HI> or the Pope's cavalcade, when he goes to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the church of St. <HI>John Lateran,</HI> the mo&s;t ancient of the churches in Rome, and the mother of all the churches in chri&s;tendom. This ceremony is equivalent to our coronation; and is performed by every Pope, as &s;oon as convenience will permit, after the conclave has declared in his favour. From St. <HI>John's Lateran,</HI> he proceeds to the capitol, and re|ceives the keys of that fortre&s;s. This is the only ce|remony in which the Pope appears in all his &s;piritual
<PB N="367" REF="377">
and temporal grandeur. He is preceded, and fol|lowed, by above two thou&s;and hor&s;emen, divided into &s;quadrons; the variety of which makes a very enter|taining &s;hew. The cardinals, the upper and lower dignitaries, and all the Pope's hou&s;hold, in ceremonial habits, make a part in this cavalcade. The lea&s;t &s;howy, and at the &s;ame time the lea&s;t convenient ac|coutrements, are tho&s;e of the cardinal: their hats, which are quite flat, are fa&s;tened to their head only by &s;trings tied under the chin; their long mantles cover the hor&s;e's whole body, like a capari&s;on; and the two corners of the cloak being made fa&s;t between his ears, the rider has no means of clearing him&s;elf in ca&s;e of any accident; which, indeed, is little to be appre|hended, &s;everal footmen going on each &s;ide of the hor&s;e, and watching its &s;teps. All the fine&s;t hor&s;es, from Spain and Sicily, are produced on this occa&s;ion; and their beauty, and graceful &s;tateline&s;s of motion, add no &s;mall addition to the &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>We had a full view of the cavalcade, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> on its return from the church, as it a&s;cended the ca|pitol. The officers, of the Pope's hor&s;e-guards, were dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;tyle equally rich and becoming. It was &s;omething between the Hungarian and Spani&s;h dre&s;s. The Swi&s;s guards were, on this occa&s;ion, dre&s;&s;ed with le&s;s propriety; their uniforms were real coats of mail, with iron helmets on their heads, as if they had been
<PB N="368" REF="378">
going to take the capitol by &s;torm, and expected a vi|gorous re&s;i&s;tance. Their appearance was &s;trongly con|tra&s;ted with that of the Roman barons, who were on hor&s;eback, without boots, and in full dre&s;s; each of them was preceded by four pages; their hair hanging in ringlets to the middle of their backs: they were followed by a number of &s;ervants in rich liveries. Bi&s;hops, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tics &s;ucceeded the barons; and then came the cardinals, on hor&s;eback, in their purple robes, which covered every part of the hor&s;es, except the head. There is no doubt but that the hor&s;es, employed at &s;uch ceremonies, are the gentle&s;t that can be found; for, if they were at all unruly, they might not only injure the &s;urrounding crowd, but throw their eminences, who are not celebrated for their &s;kill in hor&s;eman&s;hip. La&s;t of all comes the Pope him&s;elf, mounted on a milk-white mule, di&s;tri|buting ble&s;&s;ings with an un&s;paring hand among the multitude, who follow him with acclamations of <HI>Viva il Santo Padre!</HI> i. e. Long live the holy father! and, pro&s;trating them&s;elves on the ground before his mule, <HI>Benedizione, Santo Padre,</HI> i. e. Your ble&s;&s;ing, holy father. The Pope took particular care to wave his hand in the form of a cro&s;s, that the ble&s;&s;ings he pro|nounced might have the greater efficacy. As his Holine&s;s is employed in this manner, during the whole proce&s;&s;ion, he cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to give the lea&s;t at|tention to his mule, the bridle of which is held by two
<PB N="369" REF="379">
per&s;ons, who walk by his &s;ide; with &s;ome others, to catch him, and prevent his being thrown to the ground, in ca&s;e the mule &s;hould &s;tumble.</P>
<P>At the entrance of the capitol, he was met by the &s;enator of Rome; who, falling on his knees, delivered the keys into the hands of his Holine&s;s, who pro|nounced a ble&s;&s;ing over him, and re&s;tored them to him again. Proceeding from the capitol, the Pope was met by a deputation of Jews, &s;oon after he had pa&s;&s;ed through the arch of <HI>Titus.</HI> They were headed by the chief Rabbi, who pre&s;ented him with a long &s;croll of parchment, on which was written the whole law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> in Hebrew. His Holine&s;s received the parch|ment in a very gracious manner; telling the Rabbi, at the &s;ame time, that he accepted his pre&s;ent out of re|&s;pect to the law it&s;elf, but entirely rejected his inter|pretation; for the ancient law, having been fulfilled by the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, was no longer in force. As this was not a convenient time, or place, for the Rabbi to enter into a controver&s;y on this &s;ubject, he bowed in &s;ilence, and retired with his countrymen; in full conviction, that the fal&s;ehood of the Pope's a&s;&s;er|tion, would be made manife&s;t to the whole univer&s;e in due time. His Holine&s;s, meanwhile, proceeded in triumph, through the principal &s;treets, to the Vatican.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="380">Among the mo&s;t remarkable functions, during the <HI>Santa Settimana,</HI> are, fir&s;t, the ceremonies of Palm Sunday, which commence in the chapel at Monte Ca|vallo, where the Pope ble&s;&s;es the palms, and hears ma&s;s. Two &s;orts of cardinals are drawn up on each &s;ide the altar; the cardinal prie&s;ts, and cardinal dea|cons; their ve&s;tments violet-colour, ornamented with ermine and lace. Ju&s;t as the function is about to begin, the cardinals take off their furs and outward drapery, and put on ve&s;tments embroidered with gold; they then ri&s;e and approach his Holine&s;s, from who&s;e hands they receive the palms. When ma&s;s is &s;ung, the pa&s;&s;ion is recited by two eccle&s;ia&s;tics; one narrates the words and accu&s;ation of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> from the evangeli&s;ts; and the other an&s;wers for our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour; the clamour and uproar of the Jews is imi|tated by the clergy. A mo&s;t curious proce&s;&s;ion makes part of this function: the &s;treets of Rome, through which it is to pa&s;s, are &s;trewed with &s;and; and the Pon|tiff, accompanied by the cardinal, makes a public entry, in imitation of our Saviour into Jeru&s;alem, all mounted upon mules, and bearing branches of box-tree in their hands. Vain were the attempt to de&s;cribe the hor&s;eman&s;hip upon this occa&s;ion; the ob&s;tinacy of the mules, their kicking and curvetting, and the embarra&s;&s;ments ari&s;ing from the cardinals garments. A litter, covered with crim&s;on velvet, is provided for
<PB N="371" REF="381">
the Pope's u&s;e, in ca&s;e his Holine&s;s &s;hould come to the ground.</P>
<P>The next principal ceremony is the <HI>tenebrae</HI> of the holy Wedne&s;day, performed at five o'clock in the afternoon, in the chapel of St. <HI>Paulina,</HI> in the Vati|can. The <HI>tenebrae</HI> are chaunted as in other Roman Catholic churches, but executed with more judgment, and better voices. The <HI>mi&s;erere d'Allegri,</HI> concludes this function, and is performed by vocal mu&s;icians only. I own, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> I never heard mu&s;ic before. I &s;uppo&s;ed I had formed &s;ome idea of the power and effects of the human voice; but, had I been conveyed blindfold into this chapel, and no in|timation given whence the &s;ounds proceeded, I &s;hould &s;hould have believed my&s;elf in Paradi&s;e. How then &s;hall I attempt to convey the &s;lighte&s;t idea of this ce|le&s;tial melody, by any de&s;cription! I mu&s;t &s;ay no more than that I have heard enough to make me di&s;|&s;atisfied with the fine&s;t opera, and the mo&s;t perfect per|formers, that are to be found out of the chapel of St. <HI>Paulina.</HI></P>
<P>On Maundy Thur&s;day, the Pope pronounces his benediction to the people, from a balcony in St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s, where an infinite croud is collected on the occa&s;ion. The manner and the form are more &s;uitable to the holine&s;s of his character, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> than I was aware.
<PB N="372" REF="382">
I under&s;tood he cur&s;ed all Turks and heretics on the face of the earth; whereas, that part of the function is performed by two of the cardinal deacons, who read the cur&s;e, one in Italian, the other in Latin; and the words are no &s;ooner out of their mouths, than he pro|nounces the benediction, and wipes off all its ef|ficacy. The Pope is, during this ceremony, &s;upported on the &s;houlders of twelve men, in an armed chair, holding in his hand a large lighted wax taper; and, in the very in&s;tant that the la&s;t words of the cur&s;e are uttered, the bell tolls, and he throws it down among the people; which circum&s;tance clearly explains the &s;en&s;e of a proverb well known in England, of &s;wearing, or cur&s;ing by bell, book and candle. There are three or four exhortations delivered by his Holine&s;s, pre|vious to his reading the benediction; the&s;e are, that, if the a&s;&s;embly would &s;incerely repent of their &s;ins, there was room for ab&s;olution; and the benediction &s;eemed to be as little arrogant as that pronounced by our mini&s;ters at the end of the liturgy. In the mo|ment that he &s;peaks the benediction, the bell tolls, the drums beat, and the cannon at the ca&s;tle of St. <HI>An|gelo</HI> fire; which adds to the awfulne&s;s of the &s;cene, and renders the performance truly &s;olemn.</P>
<P>There is another curious ceremony performed this day; that of the Pope wa&s;hing the pilgrim's feet, as it is expre&s;&s;ed, and &s;erving them at the table. The&s;e
<PB N="373" REF="383">
are thirteen poor prie&s;ts of different nations. The prie&s;t who &s;its in the middle repre&s;ents our Saviour; and the &s;ix, on each &s;ide of him, his apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>On Good-Friday and Ea&s;ter-eve, there are no ex|traordinary ceremonies. The common <HI>mi&s;erere</HI> is chaunted; but, in the evening, the church of St. <HI>Peter</HI> is crouded with people, who walk about and con|ver&s;e. It is remarkable, that Friday and Saturday are not e&s;teemed &s;o &s;acred as the foregoing days of the holy week; and that, during the &s;aid week, no &s;hops are &s;hut; but trade and bu&s;ine&s;s go on as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>On Ea&s;ter-day, the &s;ame function that was per|formed on Thur&s;day is repeated; with this difference, that there is no cur&s;e, only the benediction. The concour&s;e of people is al&s;o greater, as the pea&s;ants from the adjacent countries are more at lei&s;ure on Sunday, to come and partake of the ble&s;&s;ing. As it is a religious ceremony, and the mob make all their religion con&s;i&s;t in ceremony, and due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the church and the prie&s;thood; there are no riots here as there would be with us. The moment the cannon at the ca&s;tle of St. <HI>Angelo</HI> fire, the good people in the neighbourhood, who hear the report, pro&s;trate them|&s;elves, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to have received the benefit of the benediction. There are both days two &s;qua|drons
<PB N="374" REF="384">
of hor&s;e, and a battalion of infantry, which are no &s;mall ornament of the fe&s;tival; for, though the troops of his Holine&s;s might po&s;&s;ibly make no great figure in a field of battle; they are well cloathed, and add much to the glory of the day, and the beauty of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s church-yard.</P>
<P>Another very important function, in the church of Rome, is in the Jubilee year. The fir&s;t Jubilee was in&s;tituted by <HI>Boniface</HI> the Eighth, in the year 1300. Many ceremonies, and in&s;titutions of the Roman Ca|tholic church, are founded on tho&s;e of the old hea|thens. This is evidently in imitation of the Roman &s;ecular games, which were exhibited every hundredth year, in honour of the gods; they la&s;ted three days and three nights; they were attended with great pomp, and drew va&s;t numbers of people to Rome, from all parts of Italy, and the mo&s;t di&s;tant provinces. <HI>Boni|face</HI> recollecting this, determined to in&s;titute &s;ome|thing analogous, which would immortalize his own name, and promote the intere&s;t of the Roman Catholic religion in general, and that of the city of Rome in particular. He embraced the favourable opportunity, which the beginning of a century pre&s;ented; he in|vented a few extraordinary ceremonies, and declared the year 1300 the fir&s;t Jubilee year; during which, he a&s;&s;ured mankind that Heaven would be in a particular manner propitious, in granting indulgences and remi&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="375" REF="385">
of &s;ins, to all who &s;hould come to Rome, and at|tend the functions there to be performed, at this for|tunate period, which was not to occur again for a hun|dred years. This drew a great concour&s;e of wealthy &s;inners to Rome; and, the extraordinary circulation of money it occa&s;ioned, was &s;trongly felt all over the Pope's dominions. <HI>Clement</HI> the Sixth, regretting that the&s;e advantages &s;hould occur &s;o &s;eldom, abridged the period, and declared there would be a Jubilee every fifty years; the &s;econd was, accordingly, celebrated in the year 1350. <HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fifth, imagining that the interval was &s;till too long, once more retrenched the half; and, ever &s;ince, there has been a Jubilee every twenty-fifth year. It is not likely that any future Pope will think of &s;hortening this period; if any alter|ation were again to place, it mo&s;t probably would be, to re&s;tore the ancient period of fifty, or a hundred years; for, in&s;tead of the wealthy pilgrims who flocked to Rome, from every quarter of Chri&s;tendom, ninety-nine in a hundred of tho&s;e who come now, are &s;up|ported by alms, during their journey, or are barely able to defray their own expences by the &s;tricte&s;t eco|nomy; and his Holine&s;s is &s;uppo&s;ed, at pre&s;ent, to de|rive no other advantage, from the uncommon fatigue he is obliged to go through on the Jubilee year, ex|cept the &s;atisfaction he feels in reflecting on the bene|fit his labours confer on the &s;ouls of beggars, and other travellers, who re&s;ort from all corners of Italy to
<PB N="376" REF="386">
Rome, on this ble&s;&s;ed occa&s;ion. The &s;tates, which border on the Pope's dominions, &s;uffer many tempo|ral inconveniences from the zeal of the pea&s;ants and manufacturers; the greater part of whom &s;till make a point of vi&s;iting St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s on the Jubilee year; the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the countries, which &s;uch emigrants abandon, is not balanced by any advantage transferred to that to which they re&s;ort. By far the greater num|ber of pilgrims come from the kingdom of Naples; who&s;e inhabitants, are &s;aid to be of a very devout and amorous di&s;po&s;ition. The fir&s;t prompts them to go to Rome, in &s;earch of that ab&s;olution which the &s;econd renders nece&s;&s;ary; and, on the year of the Jubilee, when indulgences are to be had at an ea&s;ier rate than at any other time, tho&s;e who can afford it, generally carry away &s;uch a &s;tock, as not only is &s;ufficient to clear old &s;cores, but will al&s;o &s;erve as an indemnifying fund for future tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>There is one door, into the church of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s, which is called the holy door. This is always walled up, except on this di&s;tingui&s;hed year; and even then, no per&s;on is permitted to enter by it, but in the hum|ble&s;t po&s;ture. The pilgrims, and many others, prefer crawling into the church upon their knees, by this door, to walking in, in the u&s;ual way, by any other. The &s;hutting up of this door is performed with great ceremony. The Pope being &s;eated on a rai&s;ed &s;eat,
<PB N="377" REF="387">
or kind of throne, &s;urrounded by cardinals and other eccle&s;ia&s;tics; an anthem is &s;ung, accompanied by all &s;orts of mu&s;ical in&s;truments. During the performance, his Holine&s;s de&s;cends from the throne, with a golden trowel in his hand places the fir&s;t brick, and applies &s;ome mortar; he then returns to his &s;eat, and the door is in&s;tantly built up, by more expert workmen, &s;o to remain till the next Jubilee; when it is opened with the &s;ame &s;olemnity that it is &s;hut. At the begin|ning of the la&s;t Jubilee, when the wall was thrown down; men, women, and children &s;crambled, and fought for the fragments with the &s;ame eagerne&s;s which le&s;s enlightened mobs di&s;play on days of public re|joicing, when handfuls of money are thrown among them. The Catholics a&s;&s;ert, that the&s;e pieces of brick have the virtue of curing many of the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate di&s;ea&s;es: and, if new&s;papers were permitted at Rome, there is not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to doubt, that the&s;e cures would be atte&s;ted publicly by the patients, in a manner as &s;atisfactory and convincing, as are the cures per|formed daily by the pills, powders, drops, and bal|&s;ams, adverti&s;ed in the London new&s;papers. After &s;hutting the holy door, ma&s;s is celebrated at midnight, and the ceremony attended by va&s;t multitudes of people.</P>
<P>For my part, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> from whom we have taken the de&s;cription of this ceremony. I &s;u&s;pended my cu|rio&s;ity
<PB N="378" REF="388">
till next day, which was Chri&s;tmas-day, when I went to St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s church, and &s;aw the Pope per|form ma&s;s on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>After ma&s;s, the Pope gave the benediction to the people a&s;&s;embled, in the grand court, before the church of St. <HI>Peter.</HI> It was a remarkably fine day; an im|men&s;e multitude filled that &s;pacious and magnificent area; the hor&s;e and foot guards were drawn up in their mo&s;t &s;howy uniforms. The Pope &s;eated in an open, portable chair, in all the &s;plendor which his wardrobe could give, with the tiara on his head, was carried out of a large window, which opens on a bal|cony in the front of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s. The &s;ilk hangings, and gold trappings, with which the chair was embel|li&s;hed, concealed the men who carried it, &s;o that to tho&s;e who viewed him from the area below, his Holi|ne&s;s &s;eemed to &s;ail forward from the window, &s;elf-ba|lanced in the air like a cele&s;tial being. The in&s;tant he appeared, the mu&s;ic &s;truck up, the bells rang from every church, and the cannon thundered from the ca&s;tle of St. <HI>Angelo,</HI> in repeated peals. During the intervals, the church of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s, the palace of the Vatican, and the banks of the Tibur, re-echoed the acclamations of the populace. At length, his Holi|ne&s;s aro&s;e from his &s;eat, and an immediate and awful &s;ilence en&s;ued. The multitude fell upon their knees, with their hands and eyes rai&s;ed towards his Holine&s;s,
<PB N="379" REF="389">
as to a benign deity. After a &s;olemn pau&s;e, he pro|nounced the benediction, with great fervour, elevating his out-&s;tretched arms as high as he could; then clo&s;ing them together, and bringing them back to his brea&s;t, with a &s;low motion, as if he had got hold of the ble&s;|&s;ing, and was drawing it gently from Heaven. Finally, he threw his arms open, waving them for &s;ome time, as if his intention had been to &s;catter the benediction, with impartiality, among the people.</P>
<P>No ceremony can be better calculated for &s;triking the &s;en&s;es, and impo&s;ing on the under&s;tanding, than this of the &s;upreme Pontiff, giving the ble&s;&s;ing from the balcony of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s. For my own part, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> (and other writers have made &s;imilar remarks) had I not, in my early youth, received impre&s;&s;ions highly unfavourable to the chief actor in this magni|ficent interlude; I &s;hould have been in danger of paying him a degree of re&s;pect, very incon&s;i&s;tent with the religion in which I was educated.</P>

<P>THE condition of all the citizens of Rome is as &s;ingular as the con&s;titution under which they live; and, it is in this particular, that modern Rome is mo&s;t like the ancient city. In its mo&s;t happy times, that is to the year 650, from the foundation, accord|ing to <HI>Cicero,</HI> there were &s;carce two thou&s;and hou&s;e|keepers who had any property; <HI>"qui rem haberent."</HI> And it is much to be feared, whether as many could be found among the hundred and fifty, or two hun|dred thou&s;and inhabitants, which modern Rome is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain.</P>
<P>The great officers of &s;tate, and eight or ten ancient families, but eclip&s;ed by four or five, whom the triple crown has enriched and promoted; the&s;e, together, with foreigners, &s;upply the public luxury; but, in this luxury, alms bear a con&s;iderable part. We have &s;een the riche&s;t Roman prince, not &s;pending above
<PB N="381" REF="391">
one &s;hilling per day on his table, and the furniture of his hou&s;e &s;uitable to &s;uch par&s;imony, yet di&s;tributing thou&s;ands of pounds in alms of various kinds. This &s;uperabundance of charity, which is to &s;loth, as honey to hornets, corre&s;ponds with the <HI>congiaria</HI> of the Ro|man emperors, and is productive of the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>The middle &s;tate, every where el&s;e formed by citi|zens and trades-people, is unknown at Rome. There is no medium between opulence and poverty. The rich are the riche&s;t of men, and the poor, the mo&s;t in|digent creatures in the world; an exce&s;s never known in a well-governed &s;tate. Extremities touch each other; every member of the &s;tate either gives, or re|ceives alms. No &s;mall part of the wages, of the nu|merous retinue of the cardinals and nobles, con&s;i&s;ts in alms, under the &s;oftening appellation of of <HI>buon mancie;</HI> "good fe&s;tivals:" <HI>far ago&s;to:</HI> "welcomes," or "good journies." The elde&s;t of every family, under the re|&s;pectable title of <HI>decano,</HI> is, in this re&s;pect, the &s;olicitor, receiver, and ca&s;h-keeper to his fellow-&s;ervants. In &s;hort, it is a &s;aying among the Romans them&s;elves, that there is not a burge&s;s of Rome, but would &s;ell the very &s;un for a &s;ixpence.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of ea&s;y circum&s;tances are not to be met with, among the lower dignitaries of the church; nor among the &s;et of lawyers called <HI>curiales;</HI> nor among
<PB N="382" REF="392">
tho&s;e marqui&s;&s;es and counts, who, with the title of <HI>Mae&s;tri di camera</HI> and <HI>Scudieri,</HI> are as profoundly ver&s;ed in all matters of ceremony, as the Germans in civil law; nor, in &s;hort, among the placemen belong|ing to the different officers of the court; all the&s;e live more on hope than &s;ub&s;tance. The demi&s;e of a Pope, and the vacancy occa&s;ioned thereby, reduces them to alms. The only cla&s;s of people, who&s;e competence puts them on a footing with the other ranks, are the con&s;i&s;torial coun&s;ellors. A fondne&s;s for ornament, and parade, is the hobby-hor&s;e of the Roman people, to this all other inclinations give way: it regulates and directs the expences of the rich and great; what they &s;ave in good cheer, and on comfortable living, they lavi&s;h on entertainments, equipages, liveries, and external &s;how. Equally ambitious of this are the peo|ple, amid all their penury: the &s;hambles, the butchers, and their &s;talls, are all &s;et off with linen as white as &s;now: the fruiterers &s;hops are di&s;per&s;ed in curious de&s;igns, as if for a fight: the &s;hoemaker, and even the cobler, decorates his &s;hop with &s;craps of gilded leather. When &s;ome public fe&s;tival approaches, a whole family &s;hall, for a day or two in a week, abate of their u&s;ual &s;u&s;|tenance, to furni&s;h coach-hire on the&s;e occa&s;ions. This pa&s;&s;ion for glitter and parade opens the door to intrigues. It is found with the lowe&s;t poverty. All tho&s;e of the lower cla&s;s, decked out &s;o very fine at the public places, have &s;carce a gown to their backs when
<PB N="383" REF="393">
at home; one &s;hift is their whole &s;tock, which good hou&s;ewifery will not allow them to lie in, and which every Saturday, after going through a &s;lop-wa&s;h, is di&s;played at the windows till perfectly dry.</P>
<P>Magnificence, hypocri&s;y, and &s;adne&s;s reign here: the number of fine palaces, of beautiful churches, of &s;uperb fountains, of the trea&s;ures of art, and vene|rable remains of antiquity give an air of grandeur to Rome, which is not to be found in any other country.</P>
<P>The want of public entertainments, the little popu|lation, in proportion to the extent of the city; and its &s;ituation, &s;urrounded by hills, which prevent a free circulation of air, added to the oppre&s;&s;ive weight of the <HI>plumbeus au&s;ter</HI> of <HI>Horace;</HI> the Scirocco wind, &s;eem to me the chief cau&s;es of its real &s;adne&s;s; but what in|crea&s;es this apparent gloom, is the air of &s;anctity which the Romans affect, and the general dre&s;s of the country, which is black. The habit of an Abb&eacute; is the court-dre&s;s; and, as it is al&s;o the cheape&s;t, every one wears it. Every court is the abode of di&s;&s;imula|tion; at Rome, there are as many courts as cardinals; every cardinal is a kind of prince, and may become a &s;overeign; this rea&s;on alone is &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that this country mu&s;t have more hypocritical characters than any other.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="394">Of all the &s;overeigns whom I have &s;een, &s;ays <HI>Sher|lock,</HI> the Pope repre&s;ents maje&s;ty the be&s;t; the car|dinals are like <HI>Martial</HI>'s epigrams; &s;ome good, &s;ome bad, but many more indifferent. Almo&s;t all derive honour from their rank.</P>
<P>The women are re&s;erved in public; and in private, extravagant to a degree; the prelates effeminate; the nobility, with &s;ome few exceptions, illiterate; and the people, wicked.</P>
<P>The &s;tudies, generally pur&s;ued, are, the law, anti|quities, and divinity; becau&s;e the&s;e are the three principal roads that here lead to fortune. A poet is con&s;idered as a dangerous, or at be&s;t, as an u&s;ele&s;s being; and, for this rea&s;on, a poetic talent is rather oppre&s;&s;ed than encouraged. <HI>Meta&s;ta&s;io</HI> could not there find bread.</P>
<P>We &s;ee here frequent occa&s;ion to admire the genius of <HI>Corneille,</HI> for the truth with which he has drawn the Roman women. The a&s;&s;urance of their eye, the firm|ne&s;s of their &s;tep, every feature of their face, and every movement of their body, declare the boldne&s;s of their &s;ouls. They have a very noble air, which is heightened by trailing robes, and which they all wear, down to the women of the third degree.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="395">The nation, adds <HI>Sherlock,</HI> has &s;omething like pride, which is not di&s;plea&s;ing to me; it is that &s;ort of haugh|tine&s;s we &s;ee in a man of ancient family fallen to decay. But it has a de&s;ire of di&s;gui&s;ing it&s;elf, which plea&s;es no one. The fir&s;t proverb of the country is, he who knows not how ta di&s;&s;emble, knows not how to live; and they all know how to live. They love ob&s;curity in every thing.</P>
<P>The Roman has naturally a depth of under&s;tanding and &s;trength of character; he is ea&s;ily moved; and, when he is moved, he is violent to an exce&s;s. If the dre&s;s of the country were military, we &s;hould think our&s;elves, as we walk the &s;treets, in ancient Rome; the faces we meet, &s;o much re&s;emble the characters that hi&s;tory has tran&s;mitted to us. This idea has often &s;truck me among the men; and it is &s;till more &s;triking in the women. You will often &s;ay, "There is a woman who might well be the mother of <HI>Gracchus,</HI> and there is another who might produce a <HI>Sylla!</HI>" The number of <HI>Me&s;&s;alinas</HI> is &s;mall, that of <HI>Lucretias</HI> le&s;s; and for <HI>Sempronias, Qui &s;oepius petunt viros quam petuntur, i. e.</HI> "Who oftener &s;eek for gallants, than gallants for them;" they are to be found rather at Naples than at Rome.</P>
<P>The following, &s;ays <HI>Sherlock,</HI> is a mark of national di&s;tinction, between a Roman and a Neapolitan woman;
<PB N="386" REF="396">
a woman of Naples is le&s;s mode&s;t than one of Rome, and more ba&s;hful; Neapolitan women have been often &s;een to blu&s;h, but it is not po&s;&s;ible to put a Roman woman out of countenance.</P>
<P>In their external deportment, the Italians, remarks <HI>Moore,</HI> have a grave &s;olemnity of manner, which is &s;ometimes thought to ari&s;e from a natural gloom of di&s;po&s;ition. The French, above all other nations, are apt to impute to melancholy, the &s;edate, &s;erious air which accompanies reflection.</P>
<P>Though in a pulpit, on the theatre, and even in common conver&s;ation, the Italians make u&s;e of a great deal of action; yet, Italian vivacity is different from the French; the former proceeds from &s;en&s;ibility, the latter from animal &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this country have not the bri&s;k look, and ela&s;tic trip, which is univer&s;al in France; they move rather with a flow, compo&s;ed pace; and the people of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed fa&s;hion, as well as the neglected vulgar, &s;eem to prefer the uncon&s;trained at|titude of the <HI>Antinous,</HI> and other antique &s;tatues, to the artificial graces of a French dancing-ma&s;ter, or the erect &s;trut of a German &s;oldier.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="397">Of all the countries in Europe, Switzerland is that in which the beauties of nature appear in the greate&s;t variety of forms, and on the mo&s;t magnificent &s;cale; in that country, therefore, the young land&s;cape pain|ter has the be&s;t chance of &s;eizing the mo&s;t &s;ublime ideas; but, Italy is the be&s;t &s;chool for the hi&s;toric one, not only from its being enriched with works of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters, and the noble&s;t models of antique &s;culpture; but al&s;o, on account of the fine expre&s;&s;ive &s;tile of the Italian countenance. Here are few, or none, of tho&s;e fair, flat, gli&s;tening, unmeaning faces, &s;o common in the more northern parts of Europe. I happened, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> once, to &s;it by a foreigner of my acquaintance, at the opera in London, when a certain nobleman, who was then a good deal talked of, entered. I whi&s;pered him&mdash;"This is Lord &mdash;." "Not, &s;urely, the famous Lord &mdash;," &s;aid he. "Yes," &s;aid I, "the very &s;ame." "It mu&s;t then be acknow|led," continued he, "that the noble earl does infinite honour to tho&s;e who had the care of his education." "How &s;o?" rejoined I; "Becau&s;e," replied the foreigner, "as a countenance, &s;o completely vacant, &s;trongly indicates a deficience of natural abilities; it is to be pre&s;umed, the re&s;pectable figure he makes in the &s;enate, is entirely owing to in&s;truction."</P>
<P>Strangers, on their arrival at Rome, form no high idea of the beauty of the Roman women, from the &s;pe|cimens
<PB N="388" REF="398">
they &s;ee in the fa&s;hionable circles, to which they are fir&s;t introduced. There are &s;ome excep|tions; but, in general, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the pre&s;ent race of women, of high rank, are more di&s;|tingui&s;hed by other ornaments, than their beauty. For brilliant red and white, and all the charms of complexion, no women can equal the Engli&s;h. If a hundred Engli&s;h women were taken at random, and compared with the &s;ame number at Rome; ninety of the Engli&s;h would be found hand&s;omer than ninety of the Romans; but, probably, two or three in the hun|dred Italians, might have finer countenances than any of the Engli&s;h. Beauty, in England, is more remark|able in the country, than in towns; the pea&s;antry of no country in Europe can &s;tand a competition, in point of looks, with tho&s;e of England. This race of people have the conveniences of life, in no other country, in &s;uch perfection; they are no where &s;o well fed, &s;o well defended from the injuries of the &s;ea&s;ons; and, no where el&s;e do they keep them&s;elves &s;o perfectly clean, and free, from all vilifying effects of dirt. In other countries, the female pea&s;ants are &s;o hard worked, &s;o ill &s;ed, &s;o tanned, and &s;o dirty, that it is difficult to know whether they have any beauty or not.</P>
<P>With countenances &s;o favourable for the pencil, it will naturally be imagined, that portrait-painting is in
<PB N="389" REF="399">
the highe&s;t perfection in Rome. The rever&s;e, how|ever, of this, is true; that branch of the art is in the lowe&s;t e&s;timation all over Italy. In palaces, the be&s;t furni&s;hed with pictures, a portrait is &s;eldom &s;een of the proprietor, or of any of his family. A quarter-length of the reigning Pope is, &s;ometimes, the only portrait of a living per&s;on, to be &s;een in the whole palace. Several of the Roman princes affect to have a room of &s;tate, or audience-chamber, in which is a rai&s;ed &s;eat, like a throne, with a canopy over it. In tho&s;e rooms, the effigies of the pontiffs are hung; they are the works of very inferior arti&s;ts, and &s;eldom co&s;t above three or four &s;equins. As &s;oon as his Holine&s;s departs this life, the portrait di&s;appears; and the face of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or is, in due time, hung up in its &s;tead. This, it may be &s;aid, is treating their old &s;overeign rather unkindly, and paying no very expen&s;ive com|pliment to the new; it is not &s;o economical, however, as what was practi&s;ed by a certain per&s;on in another country. He had a full-length picture of his &s;overeign, in the principal room of his hou&s;e; on his Maje&s;ty's death, to &s;ave him&s;elf the expence of a fre&s;h body, and a new &s;uit of ermine, he employed a painter to bru&s;h out the face and perriwig, and clap the new king's head on his grandfather's &s;houlders; which he declared were in the utmo&s;t pre&s;ervation, and fully able to wear out three or four &s;uch heads, as painters u&s;ually give in the&s;e degenerate days.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="400">The Italians very &s;eldom take the trouble of &s;itting for their pictures. They con&s;ider a portrait as a piece of painting, which engages the admiration of no one but the per&s;on it repre&s;ents, or the painter who drew it. Tho&s;e who are in circum&s;tances to pay the be&s;t arti&s;ts, generally employ them in &s;ubjects more uni|ver&s;ally intere&s;ting, than the repre&s;entation of human countenances, &s;taring out of a piece of canvas.</P>
<P>The &s;ummers, at Rome, are very tedious, every one keeping clo&s;e at home the whole day, and taking their naps at Rome; &s;o that, it is a common &s;aying there, "That none but dogs, ideots, and Frenchmen, walk the &s;treets in the day-time." The heat of the climate makes the Romans pa&s;&s;ionately fond of &s;pring water, iced and cooling liquors; and great quantities of &s;now and ice, brought from the mountains, and pre&s;erved in ice-hou&s;es, are con&s;umed there.</P>
<P>In regard to the unwhole&s;omene&s;s of the air, the dog-days, and &s;ome weeks after, are mo&s;tly dreaded at Rome. The precautions taken by the Romans, for the pre&s;ervation of health during the&s;e heats, would not be thought of by a foreigner. One of their good rules is expre&s;&s;ed in this &s;entence: "In June, July, and Augu&s;t, a per&s;on mu&s;t have no commerce with the ladies.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="401">But, po&s;&s;ibly, this rule is but little ob&s;erved. It is farther affirmed that a per&s;on, u&s;ed to live at Rome, cannot, without manife&s;t danger, keep within fifteen or twenty miles of that city. And, in travelling to Rome, they take care, in the la&s;t day's journey, not to put up within that di&s;tance. Even within the city they &s;eldom change their bedchamber, though it be for another in the &s;ame hou&s;e. Removals from one hou&s;e to another, between St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s and All Saints days, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o dangerous at Rome, that a tenant, or lodger, cannot be compelled to leave a hou&s;e within that term. As mutual compliments pa&s;s between friends, in other places, at the beginning of the new year, the like civility is paid here, at the beginning of the month of Augu&s;t. At this time of the year, few people go abroad in the day time; but, after &s;un-&s;et, divert them&s;elves with taking the air on foot, or in coaches; and the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t is a great day, in Rome, for fea&s;ting and friendly entertainments.</P>
<P>In England, ob&s;erves <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> &s;uicides are mo&s;t fre|quent in the beginning, or toward the clo&s;e of winter, when the Ea&s;terly winds mo&s;t prevail. But, in Rome, the greate&s;t enormities are perpetrated in the two hot|te&s;t &s;ummer months. This is imputed to the blood's being over-heated at this &s;ea&s;on; however, the exer|tion of proper &s;everity, and the abolition of a&s;ylums in churches, would &s;oon cool this pretended ardour,
<PB N="392" REF="402">
that prompts the Romans to all manner of wicked|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>That London &s;hould be more &s;ubject to fevers, and fluxes, when the North-ea&s;t wind blows, proceeds from the noxious effluvia, which that wind brings from the fens and mar&s;hes of Cambridge&s;hire, Lincoln&s;hire, and E&s;&s;ex. In Rome, the mo&s;t &s;ickly &s;ea&s;ons are, when the South, or South-ea&s;t wind blows, which the Italians call <HI>Sirocco,</HI> from the Arabic word <HI>Haloque;</HI> its cour&s;e being over the boggy uncultivated coa&s;ts of Africa, and the mora&s;&s;es that lie South of Rome.</P>
<P>After all, the Romans make too much ado about the danger of their &s;ummer heats; foreigners, who u&s;e very little precaution in this re&s;pect, enjoy as good a &s;tate of health as the natives. How many cardinals come from other countries to Rome, in &s;ummer, when a conclave is to be held, without &s;o many timorous fears, and return as well as they came? But no one will pretend to &s;ay, that heat has a re&s;pect to per&s;ons. This chimerical danger, &s;eems to have been unknown in the time of <HI>Cicero;</HI> from who&s;e epi&s;tles it appears, that he frequently re&s;ided at Rome, during the &s;ummer months, and took many journies to, and from Rome, at that &s;ea&s;on of the year.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="403">There are few countries, where a true judgment is &s;o formed of &s;trangers, as at Rome, <HI>gens emunctae naris, natura cui verba non potuit dare,</HI> &s;ays a famous Je&s;uit of the modern Romans. That is, they are people of an acute di&s;cernment, to whom nature has not given the power of unfolding their thoughts. Their cu&s;tom of &s;tudying one another, produces this habit of &s;agacity; this is the polar &s;tar, by which they &s;teer their beha|viour toward tho&s;e with whom they have any inter|cour&s;e. They cannot be long impo&s;ed upon, either by a dull or promi&s;ing phy&s;iognomy: to them, this is no more than the <HI>per&s;ona tragica,</HI> the ma&s;k to the fox. An appearance of frankne&s;s, an air of gaiety, entirely unhinges them; and puzzles them the more, as being le&s;s allied to that gravity, in which they muffle them|&s;elves up, that others may not &s;ee into them.</P>
<P>This gravity never leaves them in public, nor even in the parties of plea&s;ure, which &s;eem contrived to &s;hake it off. In private, however, they make them|&s;elves amends. Nothing can be more chearful than their clubs; where a &s;elect party freely give them&s;elves up to that tranquil gaiety, &s;uited to the natural &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s of their character, and in which con&s;i&s;ted the <HI>ur|banitas</HI> of the ancient Romans. There one may laugh, even at per&s;ons who form part of the company; there the <HI>&s;propo&s;iti</HI> of a foreigner, e&s;teemed &s;o far as to be
<PB N="394" REF="404">
admitted among them, and who is never reproved in public, for not &s;peaking the language correct, are made matters of merriment; there they laugh more, and more heartily, than in any other place; and circulate a num|ber of tales, of which they have an inexorable fund; and &s;uch excellent relaters are the Romans, that their manner always gives an air of novelty to their &s;tory. Let the following &s;erve as a &s;pecimen.</P>
<P>In the engagement between the devil and St. <HI>Michael</HI> the archangel, finding his &s;pear was rather an incum|brance than of any u&s;e to him, darted up again to Heaven; and catching up a thunder-bolt, hurled it headlong at <HI>Lucifer,</HI> &s;o that his body flew about in pieces: his legs fell in France; and hence the petulance of the French, and their pa&s;&s;ion for rambling: <HI>Lucifer</HI>'s head went into Spain; and to this is owing the pride, &s;tiffne&s;s, and overbearing carriage of the Spaniards: the hand, with which the fiend u&s;ed to pilfer, Naples got; and that, with which he &s;queezed people, was Genoa's portion: his &s;tomach was picked up in Germany; and the lea&s;t honourable parts of his body alighted in Rome; and this, adds the Romans, has made all of us &s;uch whore-ma&s;ters as we are.</P>
<P>The Italians have retained tho&s;e words, which other nations have ca&s;hiered; as politene&s;s and good man|ners
<PB N="395" REF="405">
began to prevail among them. The objects, ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the&s;e words, are an ample field for the con|vivial mu&s;es. In &s;hort, Italy &s;warms both with ob&s;cene and devout &s;onnets. They are, from their infancy, ac|cu&s;tomed to nudities, as were the Greeks and Romans. Their ears are as little moved with the expre&s;&s;ion, as their eyes with the repre&s;entation of objects; the in|decency of which has been le&s;&s;ened by habit. It was from a deep-rooted cu&s;tom, that after <HI>Benedict</HI> IV. was exalted to the Pontificate, one of the mo&s;t ob&s;cene words in the Italian language, equally e&s;caped him, both in his anger and mirth; that is, it was almo&s;t always on his tongue. This word, and its counter|part, are the mo&s;t common oaths, or rather interjec|tions, among the Romans. <HI>Per dio</HI> (by God) is &s;el|dom or ever heard, on account of the penalties pro|nounced again&s;t per&s;ons guilty of bla&s;phemy; but, <HI>per dio Bacco,</HI> is in every one's mouth.</P>
<P>The merriment of private clubs never &s;hews it|&s;elf in public, but during the carnival; in no part of Italy, is that fe&s;tival carried to &s;uch a pitch of extra|vagance and folly, as at Rome; it is a perfect tran|&s;cript of the ancient <HI>&s;aturnalia,</HI> in all its mad frolics.</P>
<P>Breach of cha&s;tity, in females of low rank, is not con&s;idered here in the &s;ame heinous light, as in &s;ome
<PB N="396" REF="406">
parts of Germany and Great Britain; where it is deemed a crime of &s;uch magnitude, as to require ex|piation, by a public rebuke from the officiating mi|ni&s;ter, in the middle of the church. In the&s;e coun|tries, tho&s;e who live in an open and avowed breach of cha&s;tity, are generally more daringly wicked and de|void of principle, than the Italian women, who take the &s;ame liberties. In Italy, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> women, who never put any value on the virtue of cha&s;tity, tho&s;e who &s;ell their favours for money, di&s;play a goodne&s;s of character in other re&s;pects, and continue their duty and attachment to their parents, as long as they live. Foreigners, who form a connection with a girl in this country, find them&s;elves very often obliged to maintain the father, mother, and whole family to which &s;he belongs. The lover generally con&s;iders this as a very trouble&s;ome circum&s;tance; and, endea|vours to in&s;pire his Italian mi&s;tre&s;s with that total neglect of her family, which prevails among women of her &s;tamp in other countries; but he very &s;eldom &s;ucceeds. An Italian woman is unwilling to quit her native city, and her family, even for a man &s;he loves; and &s;eldom does, till he makes &s;ome provi&s;ion for her neare&s;t relations. They attend ma&s;s, and the cere|monies of devotion, with as much punctuality as if their lives were regular in all other re&s;pects.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="407">Of their attending to the external functions of their religion, with &s;crupulous exactne&s;s, the above writer cites a remarkable trait in an Italian woman of fa&s;hion, who refu&s;ed to have any farther connexion with her cici&s;beo, or lover, becau&s;e her confe&s;&s;or had refu&s;ed her ab&s;olution. This lady was di&s;tingui&s;hed at Rome, for a punctilious ob&s;ervance of all the ceremonies ap|pointed by the church; &s;he could not eat meat on a meagre day, or deviate from the canonical regulation, in any point of equal importance, without remor&s;e; but, in matters of gallantry, &s;he had the reputation of being infinitely more liberal, both in her &s;entiments and practice. She had been, for &s;ome time, provided with a very able and re&s;pectable lover, of her own country. This did not make her blind to the quali|ties of a young Engli&s;hman, with whom &s;he formed a very intimate connection, &s;oon after his arrival at Rome; not that &s;he preferred him to her la&s;t lover, but, merely from a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the truth and beauty of this arithmetical axiom, that one and one make two. The new arrangement with our countryman, however plea&s;ing to the lady, gave offence to her father con|fe&s;&s;or. The &s;crupulous eccle&s;ia&s;tic was of opinion, that a connection of this nature, with a heretic, was more criminal, than with a man of her own commu|nion. The Engli&s;hman entered her apartments one day as the confe&s;&s;or went out; &s;he &s;hut the door after
<PB N="398" REF="408">
him, with a violence that &s;hook the whole hou&s;e, mut|tering, as &s;he returned to her &s;eat, "The devil go along with you for an old goo&s;e." Her lover ex|pre&s;&s;ed his concern on &s;eeing her &s;o much agitated. "No wonder," &s;aid &s;he, "that &s;tubborn <HI>animalaccio,</HI> who has ju&s;t gone out, has had the in&s;olence to refu&s;e me ab&s;olution. As I expected you this morning, I &s;ent for him betimes, that the matter might have been expedited before you &s;hould come; but here have I been above an hour, endeavouring to per&s;uade him, but all to no purpo&s;e; nothing I could &s;ay, was able to mollify the ob&s;tinate old grea&s;y &s;coundrel." The Engli&s;hman joined in abu&s;ing the confe&s;&s;or's perver&s;e|ne&s;s; hinting, at the &s;ame time, &s;he ought to de&s;pi&s;e it as a matter of no importance; that &s;he was &s;ure of receiving ab&s;olution &s;ooner or later; and that, when|ever it happened, all the tran&s;actions of the internal, would be comprehended in that one act of grace. Upon the &s;trength of this rea&s;oning, he was proceed|ing to fulfil the purpo&s;e of his vi&s;it, with as much ala|crity, as if the mo&s;t complete di&s;charge had been granted for all pa&s;t proceedings&mdash;<HI>Pian Piano idol mio,</HI> "&s;oftly, &s;oftly, my love," cried the lady, <HI>bi&s;ogna ri|metter&s;i alla volunt&agrave; di dio.</HI> "We mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the will of Heaven." She then told her lover, that, al|though &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed the confe&s;&s;or as much as he could do, yet &s;he mu&s;t take care of her &s;oul; that, not hav|ing
<PB N="399" REF="409" MS="y">
&s;ettled her accounts with Heaven for a long time, &s;he was determined not to begin a new &s;core till the old was cleared off; adding, for her principal rea&s;on, <HI>Patto chiaro, amico caro.</HI> "Short accounts make long friends."</P>
