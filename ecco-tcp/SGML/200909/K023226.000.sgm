<P>AT a moment like the pre&s;ent, when wilful mi&s;|repre&s;entations are indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread by the partizans of ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ary power, and the advocates of pa&s;&s;ive obedie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce and Court-G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vernment; we think it incumbent upon us to declare to the world our principles, and the motives of our conduct.</P>
<P>We rejoice at the glorious event of the <HI>French Revol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion.</HI></P>
<P>If it be a&s;ked&mdash;What is the French Revolution to us?</P>
<P>We an&s;wer (as has been already an&s;wered in ano|ther place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of the vol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">teers of Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</NOTE>) <HI>It it much.</HI>&mdash;Much to us as men: Much to us as Engli&s;hmen.</P>
<P>As men, we rejoice in the freedom of twenty five millions of our fellow m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n. We rejoice in the pro&s;|pect, which &s;uch a magnificent example opens to the world. We congratulate the French nation for ha|ving laid the axe to the root of tyranny, and for erecting Government on the &s;acred HEREDITARY Rights of MAN.&mdash;Rights, which appertain to ALL, and not to a yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e more than to another. We know of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o human authority, &s;uperior to that of a whole nation: a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d we profe&s;s and proclaim it as our prin|ciple that every nation has at all times, an inherent, indefea&s;ible right to con&s;titute and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch Go|vernment for it&s;elf as be&s;t accords with its di&s;po&s;i|tion, intere&s;t and happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="3">As Engli&s;hmen, we al&s;o rejoice, becau&s;e we are <HI>immediately</HI> intere&s;ted in the French Revolution.</P>
<P>Without enquiring into the ju&s;tice, on either &s;ide of the reproachful charges of intrigue and ambition, which the Engli&s;h and French Court have con&s;tant|ly made on each other, we confine our&s;elves to this ob&s;ervation:&mdash;That if the Court of France only was in fault, and the numerous wars which have di&s;tre&s;|ed both countries are chargeable to her alone, that Court now exi&s;ts no longer; and the cau&s;e and the con&s;equence mu&s;t cea&s;e together. The French, therefore, by the Revolution they have made, have conquered for us as well as for them&s;elves; if it be true, that their Court only was in fault and ours never.</P>
<P>On this &s;tate of the ca&s;e, the French Revolution concerns us <HI>immediately:</HI> We are oppre&s;&s;ed with a heavy National debt, a burthen of taxes, and an expen&s;ive admini&s;tration of Government; beyond tho&s;e of any people in the world. We have al&s;o a very numerous poor: and we hold, that the moral obligation of providing for old age, helple&s;s infancy and poverty, is far &s;uperior to that of &s;upplying the invented wants of courtly extravagance, ambition and intrigue.</P>
<P>We believe there is no in&s;tance to be produced, but in England, of <HI>&s;even</HI> millions of inhabitants, which make but little more than <HI>one</HI> million of families, paying yearly SEVENTEEN MILIONS of taxes.</P>
<P>As it has always been held out by all admini&s;tra|tions, that the re&s;tle&s;s ambition of the Court of France rendered this expence nece&s;&s;ary to us for our own defence: we con&s;equently rejoice as men deeply intere&s;ted in the French Revolution: for that Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="4" REF="4">as we have already &s;aid exi&s;ts no longer; and con|&s;equently the &s;ame enormous expences need not continue to us.</P>
<P>Thus rejoicing, as we &s;incerely do, both as men and Engli&s;hmen, as lovers of univer&s;al peace and freedom, and as friends to our own national pro&s;pe|rity and a reduction of our public expences: we cannot but expre&s;s our a&s;toni&s;hment, that any part, or any Members of our own Government, &s;hould re|probate the extinction of that very power in France, or wi&s;h to &s;ee it re&s;tored, to who&s;e influence they formerly attributed (whil&s;t they appeared to lament) the enormous increa&s;e of our own burthens and tax|es. What then, Are they &s;orry that the pretence for new oppre&s;&s;ive taxes, and the occa&s;ion for continu|ing many old taxes, will be at an end?&mdash;If &s;o, and if it is the policy of Courts and Court Government to prefer enemies to friends, and a &s;y&s;tem of war to that of peace, as affording more pretences for Pla|ces, Offices, Pen&s;ions, Revenue and Taxation, it is high time for the people of every nation to look with circum&s;pection to their own intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who <HI>pay</HI> the expence, and, <HI>not</HI> tho&s;e who <HI>participate</HI> in the emoluments ari&s;ing from it, are the per&s;ons immediately intere&s;ted in enquiries of this kind. We are a part of that National body, on whom this annual expence of &s;eventeen millions falls; and we con&s;ider the pre&s;ent opportunity of the French Revolution, as a mo&s;t happy one for le&s;&s;ening the enormous load, under which this nation groans. If this be not done, we &s;hall then have rea&s;on to con|clude, that the cry of intrigue and ambition again&s;t <HI>other</HI> Courts is no more than the common cant of <HI>all</HI> Courts.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">We think it al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to expre&s;s our a&s;toni&s;h|ment, that a Government de&s;irous of being called FREE, &s;hould prefer connexions with the mo&s;t de&s;|potic and arbitary powers in Europe. We know of none more de&s;erving this de&s;cription, than tho&s;e of Turkey and Pru&s;&s;ia, and the whole combination of German de&s;pots.&mdash;Separated as we happily are by nature from the tumults of the Continent we repro|bate all &s;y&s;tems and intrigues which &s;acrifice (and that too at a great expence) the ble&s;&s;ings of our natural &s;i|tuation. &mdash;Such &s;y&s;toms cannot have a national origin.</P>
<P>If we are a&s;ked, What Government is?&mdash;We hold it to be nothing more than a NATIONAL ASSOCIATION and we hold that to be the be&s;t, which &s;ecures to eve|ry man his rights, and promotes the greate&s;t quantity of happine&s;s with the <HI>lea&s;t expence.</HI></P>
<P>We live to improve, or we live in vain; and therefore we admit of no maxims of government or policy, on the mere &s;core of antiquity, or other men's authority, the <HI>Old</HI> Whigs, or the <HI>New.</HI></P>
<P>We will exerci&s;e the rea&s;on with which we are en|dued, or we po&s;&s;e&s;s it unworthily. As rea&s;on is gi|ven at all times, it is for the purpo&s;e of being u&s;ed at all times.</P>
<P>Among the ble&s;&s;ings which the French Revolution has produced to that nation, we enumerate the abo|lition of the feudal &s;y&s;tem of inju&s;tice and tyranny, on the 4th. of Augu&s;t, 1789. Beneath the feudal &s;y&s;tem all Europe has long groaned, and from it En|gland is not yet free. Game-laws, borough-tenures and tyrannical monopolies of numerous kinds &s;till remain among&s;t us: but rejoicing as we &s;incerely do, in the freedom of others, till we &s;hall happily accom|pli&s;h
<PB N="6" REF="6">our own, we intended to commemorate this prelude to the univer&s;al extirpation of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, by meeting on the anniver&s;ary of that day, (the 4th, of Augu&s;t) at the Crown and Anchor. From this meeting we were prevented by the inter|ference of certain <HI>unnamed</HI> and <HI>&s;culking</HI> per&s;ons with the Ma&s;ter of the Tavern, who informed us that on <HI>their</HI> repre&s;entations he could not receive us.&mdash;Let tho&s;e who live by, or countenance feudal oppre&s;&s;ions take the reproach of this ineffectual meanne&s;s and cowardice to them&s;elves. They cannot &s;tifle the pub|lic declaration of our hone&s;t, open, and avowed opinions.</P>
<P>The&s;e are our principles, and the&s;e our &s;entiments. They embrace the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of the great body of the nation of which we are a part. As to riots and tumults, let tho&s;e an&s;wer for them, who by wilful mi&s;repre&s;entations endeav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur to excite and promote them; or, who &s;eek to <HI>&s;tun</HI> the &s;en&s;e of the nation, and lo&s;e the great cau&s;e of public good, in the outrages of a mi&s;informed mob. We take our ground on principles that require no &s;uch riotous aid. We have nothing to apprehend from the poor; for we are pleading their cau&s;e. And we fear not proud oppre&s;&s;ion; for we have Truth on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>We &s;ay, and we repeat it; that the French Revo|lution opens to the world an opportunity, in which all good citizens mu&s;t rejoice; that of promoting the general happine&s;s of Man. And that it, more|over, offers to this country in particular an oppor|tunity of reducing our enormous Taxes.</P>
<P>The&s;e are our objects, and we will pur&s;ue them.</P>
