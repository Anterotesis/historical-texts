<P>COMMON CHARITY will induce us to believe that the advocates for an occa&s;ional <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> laws are not really aware of the dangerous tendency of &s;uch a mea&s;ure; and therefore when the author of this Prote&s;t (in the following pages) charges the advi&s;ers and promoters of the &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion with <Q>high-trea&s;on again&s;t the king and &s;tate,</Q> he profe&s;&s;es to aim the &s;everity of his cen&s;ure chiefly again&s;t <HI>the mea&s;ure it&s;elf,</HI> (in order to expre&s;s the <HI>real danger</HI> and <HI>malignity</HI> of its ef|fect,) rather than again&s;t the <HI>per&s;ons</HI> of tho&s;e men who, inadvertently, or through inattention to the <HI>fundamental</HI> or <HI>indi&s;|pen&s;able principles of law,</HI> have promoted
<PB N="4" REF="3">
it: and therefore to <HI>tho&s;e</HI> per&s;ons, joint|ly with all the other People of England, (as being equally intere&s;ted with the re&s;t in the effects of &s;uch a mea&s;ure) the au|thor of this Prote&s;t now addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, not to promote a &s;pirit of vengeance and per&s;onal re&s;entment, but merely for the purpo&s;es of warning and in&s;truction to <HI>all parties,</HI> that they may cordially unite in re&s;toring the <HI>due limitations</HI> of govern|ment, on which depends the common &s;afety both of king and people.</P>
<P>The Advocates for an occa&s;ional <HI>&s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of the law,</HI> perhaps, will alledge, that the new <HI>temporary</HI> powers (whate|ver they may happen to be) which would thereby be thrown into the hands of the per&s;ons intru&s;ted with the admini&s;tra|tion of government, are by no means intended to take effect again&s;t <HI>the People of England,</HI> that are re&s;ient <HI>in</HI> this i&s;land, but only again&s;t &s;uch per&s;ons as
<PB N="5" REF="4">
have <HI>been guilty of trea&s;on in foreign parts</HI> (in <HI>America,</HI> let us &s;uppo&s;e, for in&s;tance) or <HI>on the high &s;eas, or for piracy;</HI> and therefore they conceive, that the free inhabitants of this i&s;land could not be injured by &s;o limited a <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;ion</HI> of the laws, e&s;pecially if they &s;hould admit in their bill an additional clau&s;e of limita|tion, propo&s;ed even by an oppo&s;ite par|ty, by way of &s;ecurity; which we will &s;uppo&s;e to be couched in the following terms, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That nothing herein is intended, or &s;hall be con&s;trued, to extend to the ca&s;e of any other pri&s;oner or pri|&s;oners than &s;uch as &s;hall have <HI>BEEN OUT OF THE REALM AT THE TIME OR TIMES OF THE OFFENCE OR OFFENCES</HI> wherewith he or they &s;hall be charged, or of which they &s;hall be &s;u&s;pected.</Q> Such a clau&s;e as this &s;eems, on a &s;light examination, to &s;e|cure the inhabitants of this i&s;land from the danger of an <HI>unlimited</HI> power, again&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="5">
which all true Engli&s;hmen ought to be ever upon their guard: but, alas! &s;o dan|gerous is it to &s;top the ordinary cour&s;e of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>common right,</HI> or to alter the <HI>"due proce&s;s of the law,"</HI> in any ca|&s;es what&s;oever wherein <HI>per&s;onal liberty</HI> (the highe&s;t and mo&s;t valuable <HI>temporal</HI> object of Engli&s;hmen) is concerned, that, if we &s;hould <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> the ca&s;e of &s;uch a <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the laws</HI> as courtiers in general would endeavour to obtain, were they to be intru&s;ted with <HI>the com|piling of a bill</HI> for that purpo&s;e, and then carefully compare the &s;aid <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed bill</HI> with the abovementioned <HI>clau&s;e of limitation,</HI> we &s;hould &s;oon have rea&s;on to be convinced that the &s;ecurity of the latter is only <HI>imaginary;</HI> and that mul|titudes of his maje&s;ty's <HI>innocent</HI> and <HI>peaceable</HI> &s;ubjects would be &s;till liable to be oppre&s;&s;ed, and be denied the benefits of <HI>public ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>common right,</HI> by &s;uch a <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;ion of law,</HI> if they &s;hould happen
<PB N="7" REF="6">
to incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of per&s;ons in power, or be mi&s;repre&s;ented to them by any &s;ecret enemy.</P>
<P>The propo&s;ed clau&s;e leaves unpro|tected all the nobility, gentry, and other per&s;ons what&s;oever, that have made any excur&s;ions into <HI>France, Italy, Germany, Flanders, &amp;c.</HI> or even to <HI>Ireland,</HI> ever &s;ince the commencement of the troubles (whatever they might be) which occa|&s;ioned an <HI>imaginary nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> or plea, for SUSPENDING THE LAWS. And this, perhaps, might be extended three or four years back, and might thereby exclude from the protection of the limiting clau&s;e a great multitude of the mo&s;t re|&s;pectable people of the kingdom, who might happen to have travelled abroad during &s;uch a period. Neither does the clau&s;e protect the merchants, traders, and other per&s;ons, that have arrived from the We&s;t-Indies, Ireland, or any other
<PB N="8" REF="7">
country, within &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ed period. And they are, &s;urely, too numerous and re&s;pectable a body to be thus <HI>outlawed!</HI></P>
<P>Add to this, that all <HI>&s;eafaring Per&s;ons without exception</HI> (though they are the mo&s;t valuable &s;ubjects of this maritime &s;tate) would be left unprotected by &s;uch a clau&s;e, and of cour&s;e would be rendered &s;ubject to the <HI>unlimited</HI> WILL <HI>of man,</HI> (ARBITRIUM <HI>hominis,</HI> which is the true definition of ARBITRARY POWER,) <HI>in|&s;tead</HI> of LAW! And, la&s;tly, all other per&s;ons what&s;oever are liable to &s;uffer the &s;ame inconveniences, if they have not kept a diary, or have not memory or memo|randums, to enable them to produce &s;uf|ficient evidence of their being actually WITHIN THIS REALM at any period of time that might be fixed upon within the la&s;t three or four years; &s;o that not only per&s;ons <Q><HI>&s;eized and taken</HI> OUT OF THE REALM</Q> would be made liable to
<PB N="9" REF="8">
the effects of &s;uch a <HI>&s;u&s;pending act,</HI> but all the other per&s;ons abovementioned, though they are actually RESIENT WITHIN THE REALM.</P>
<P>In order to &s;tate the ca&s;e for my argu|ment as clearly as I am able, I have here &s;uppo&s;ed the adoption of &s;uch a <HI>&s;u&s;pend|ing bill</HI> as we might naturally conceive to be propo&s;ed by any &s;et of men in power, who are warmed by the &s;un&s;hine of court-favour till they forget that their own real intere&s;t is in&s;eparably connected with that of the public, and that the increa&s;e of power, which they promote, may po&s;&s;ibly fall into &s;ome other hands than their own. But the hands of govern|ment mu&s;t be &s;trengthened, they would probably &s;ay; and, for this purpo&s;e, they would be very apt to in&s;ert in their bill &s;ome di&s;cretionary powers to enable the king and his mini&s;ters to impri&s;on not on|ly per&s;ons <Q>&s;eized and taken out of the
<PB N="10" REF="9">
realm,</Q> <HI>but al&s;o per&s;ons</HI> <Q>who &s;hall be committed in any part of his maje&s;ty's do|minions for the &s;aid crimes,</Q> I mean, any crimes which I have before &s;up|po&s;ed in &s;tating this ca&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>High-trea&s;on in any of his maje&s;ty's colonies or plantations in America, or <HI>ON THE HIGH SEAS,</HI></Q> <HI>(which will include our own coa&s;ts any where beyond low-water mark,)</HI> <Q>or the crime of piracy,</Q> without any de&s;cription or limitation of place what&s;oever! So that if any inno|cent man (who happens not to be able to prove an <HI>alibi</HI> for every day, and even every hour, &s;ince the&s;e troubles began) &s;hould be maliciou&s;ly <HI>"charged with"</HI> the crime of <HI>trea&s;on</HI> or <HI>piracy</HI> committed within half a mile of the Briti&s;h coa&s;ts, he may be &s;eized and impri&s;oned, <Q>without bail or mainprize,</Q> at the <HI>will and plea|&s;ure</HI> of the king and council, for <HI>many months;</HI> and, at the expiration of the <HI>limited</HI> time, (without any farther exa|mination
<PB N="11" REF="10">
or opportunity of being heard at all by his country,) his term of con|finement is prolonged by another <HI>&s;uch act,</HI> and perhaps another after that, (as <HI>evil</HI> examples beget others,) till the time of his relief by <Q>due proce&s;s of the law</Q> becomes totally <HI>uncertain</HI> and <HI>in|definite!</HI> &mdash; A deplorable condition this! which, in our common law, is deemed <HI>"wretched &s;lavery;"</HI> &mdash; for, <Q>Mi&s;era e&s;t &s;ervitus</Q> <HI>(&s;ays the maxim)</HI> <Q>ubi <HI>JUS</HI> e&s;t vagum aut incertum.</Q> (<HI>Prin|cipia leg. &amp; Aeq. p.</HI> 61.)</P>
<P>But the condition of the <HI>deluded</HI> &s;ub|jects will be rendered &s;till more com|pletely <HI>uncertain</HI> and <HI>wretched,</HI> if the compilers of the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;u&s;pending act &s;hould endeavour to avail them&s;elves of <HI>vague</HI> terms and expre&s;&s;ions: &mdash; for in|&s;tance, &mdash; (in the body of the bill,) &mdash; <HI>"Such crimes"</HI> (referring to the crimes particularly named in the former part)
<PB N="12" REF="11">
in&s;tead of <HI>"the &s;aid crimes:"</HI> &mdash; for, as <HI>"Nullum &s;imile e&s;t idem,"</HI> &mdash; <Q>( LIKE <HI>is not</HI> THE SAME,)</Q> &mdash; the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>"&s;uch crimes,"</HI> &s;ignifies only <HI>&s;imilar crimes,</HI> and not <HI>the &s;ame crimes</HI> before expre&s;&s;ed, whereby the power of the act would be liable to an arbitrary exten|&s;ion at the <HI>will</HI> of the magi&s;trate!</P>
<P>Whenever per&s;ons in power cea&s;e to be <HI>duly limited</HI> by a free parliament, they will pay but very little regard to the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the propo&s;itions which they tender to that, <HI>once,</HI> augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly; and therefore, if &s;uch an <HI>illegal</HI> power &s;hould ever be u&s;urped by any &s;et of men, we may then expect to find many more <HI>vague</HI> expre&s;&s;ions in our public acts! &mdash; We may in that ca&s;e, without improbability, &s;uppo&s;e the penning of a <HI>&s;u&s;pending act</HI> to be &mdash; not only <Q>for &s;uch crimes, <HI>OR ANY</HI> of them,</Q> &mdash; but al&s;o <Q>for <HI>SUSPICION</HI> of <HI>SUCH
<PB N="13" REF="12">
 CRIMES,</HI> or any of them, by any ma|gi&s;trate,</Q> <HI>&amp;c. viz.</HI> any trading ma|gi&s;trate, pen&s;ioned Middle&s;ex ju&s;tice, or other wretched time-&s;erver, that may happen to be entru&s;ted with a power of committing to pri&s;on. &mdash; And in &s;uch times it will afford a &s;ufficient handle again&s;t any per&s;on what&s;oever, if they are but <HI>"charged with"</HI> &s;uch crimes, whether they be guilty of them or not; or even if they be but <Q><HI>CHARGED WITH</HI></Q> the <Q><HI>SUSPICION</HI> of <HI>SUCH</HI> crimes, or any of them, by <HI>ANY</HI> ma|gi&s;trate, </Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &mdash; Nothing more <HI>arbitrary</HI> or <HI>capricious</HI> can ea&s;ily be de|&s;cribed; and yet, alas! my <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed bill</HI> by no means exceeds the bounds of probability; for, when the baneful practice of <HI>bribery</HI> becomes triumphant, and the very foundations of government are thoroughly <HI>corrupted,</HI> we may ex|pect that <HI>probability</HI> will &s;till go farther, and that the above <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> extraordinary
<PB N="14" REF="13">
powers will be farther augmented by a <HI>"non ob&s;tante,"</HI> to trample down at once, not only the <HI>Habeas Corpus Act,</HI> but all the other fences of Briti&s;h <HI>liber|ty,</HI> national <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> and <HI>common right,</HI> on which the &s;afety of Engli&s;hmen de|pends! <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>any law, &s;tatute, or u|&s;age, to the contrary, in any wi&s;e not|with&s;tanding. </Q></P>
<P>The clau&s;e is indeed a common one, for the repeal of u&s;ele&s;s or indifferent matters; but, when the effect extends to annul all the laws of <HI>per&s;onal protec|tion,</HI> and the <HI>common right</HI> of Engli&s;h|men to <HI>"the due proce&s;s of the law,"</HI> (which is, to be tried <HI>without delay</HI> by their country, <HI>[per legem terrae,]</HI> and, <HI>if innocent,</HI> to be re&s;tored to freedom,) &mdash; &s;uch a <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;ion,</HI> I &s;ay, of <HI>common ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>common right</HI> is &s;o fun|damentally &s;ubver&s;ive of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution of &s;tate, that no authority
<PB N="15" REF="14">
of parliament can make it <HI>legal;</HI> becau&s;e it it is <HI>high-trea&s;on</HI> again&s;t the king and people! and all the abettors and promo|ters of &s;uch an act would thereby render them&s;elves <HI>"eternally infamous"</HI> in the eye of the law! &mdash; which is declared by a con&s;titutional maxim: &mdash; <Q>LEGEM TERRAE <HI>amittentes</HI> PERPETUAM IN|FAMIAE NOTAM <HI>inde merito incur|runt.</HI></Q> (3. in&s;t. p. 221.)&mdash; <Q> <HI>Tho&s;e men, who &s;et a&s;ide</HI> THE LAW OF THE LAND,</Q> (which is certainly the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who vote for <HI>&s;u&s;pending</HI> it,) <Q><HI>do thereby incur a</HI> PERPETUAL STAIN <HI>of</HI> INFAMY!</Q></P>
<P>If ever &s;uch an act, therefore, &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and the promoters of it remain in power, Briti&s;h &s;ubjects may amu&s;e them&s;elves with the <HI>name of freedom</HI> if they plea&s;e, but they will have no more <HI>real</HI> and <HI>ju&s;t</HI> right to boa&s;t of their <HI>liber|ty</HI> than the &s;ubjects of France or Pru&s;&s;ia!
<PB N="16" REF="15">
For they would then be involved exactly in the &s;ame <HI>uncertain</HI> and <HI>precarious</HI> con|dition! And, though they might not, perhaps, for &s;ome con&s;iderable time af|terwards, begin to feel the pernicious effects of a government <HI>unlimited by law,</HI> yet that would not render their condi|tion le&s;s <HI>ba&s;e</HI> or <HI>&s;lavi&s;h,</HI> for our common law has already &s;tated the condition of &s;uch as an <HI>outlawed</HI> people: &mdash; <Q>Res e&s;t mi&s;era, ubi <HI>JUS</HI> e&s;t vagum.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q> Grounds and Rudiments of Law and Equity, p. 304.</Q></NOTE> &mdash; <Q> <HI>WRETCHED</HI> is the &s;tate of affairs wherever <HI>COMMON RIGHT</HI> is vague</Q> <HI>and uncertain!</HI> &mdash; Nay it is downright <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> as declared by another maxim, already cited, in p. 11.</P>
<P>The learned Sir Robert Atkins (for|merly one of the judges of the Common Pleas) has remarked, (concerning <Q>the pope's exerci&s;e of his power of di&s;pen|&s;ing, </Q>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
or rather of <HI>&s;u&s;pending laws,</HI> by virtue of &s;uch a <HI>"non ob&s;tante,"</HI>) that <Q><HI>it was u&s;ed with &s;ome moderation</HI> AT FIRST, in ca&s;es that &s;eemed to be <HI>of</HI> GREAT NECESSITY only; but at la&s;t, by degrees, it grew to be <HI>in|tolerable and unlimited.</HI></Q> (See his parliamentary and political Tracts, p. 247.) And &s;urely we ought to be e|qually jealous of every claim or preten|&s;ion to <HI>omnipotence,</HI> or <HI>unlimited power,</HI> whenever and by whom&s;oever it is made, though we do not immediately feel the baneful effects of it.&mdash;There are but too many advocates for the imaginary <HI>omni|potence,</HI> or <HI>unlimited power,</HI> of parlia|ment!</P>
<P>True it is, that the &s;ame per&s;ons, who are entru&s;ted with authority to <HI>make laws,</HI> are entru&s;ted likewi&s;e with autho|rity to <HI>&s;u&s;pend</HI> or <HI>repeal</HI> them; but in this (without the lea&s;t detriment to their
<PB N="18" REF="17">
ju&s;t <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>free</HI> privileges) they are not without <HI>limitation.</HI> Even <HI>liberty</HI> it|&s;elf is <HI>limited,</HI> and &s;ubmits to the &s;ame &s;ort of definition; for <Q><HI>liberty</HI></Q> (&s;ays an old and eminent law-writer) <Q>is not a power to act, <HI>quidquid libet, what we li&s;t,</HI> (for this may be <HI>licentious,</HI> and a lu&s;t or pa&s;&s;ion may en&s;lave a man</Q> [or men] <Q>as much as any chain or fetter,) but, <HI>quod licet,</HI> what is <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>ratio|nal. </HI></Q> <Q>(Rights of the Kingdom, <HI>p. 136.</HI>)</Q> And, in the preceding page, &s;peaking expre&s;&s;ly of the hou&s;e of com|mons, or parliaments, he &s;ays: &mdash; <Q> When they are <HI>FREEST</HI> they have <HI>LI|MITS,</HI> for they be <HI>NOT INFINITE.</HI> Nay, when they are <HI>MOST FREE,</HI> they are <HI>MOST BOUND</HI> to <HI>GOOD ORDERS</HI> and <HI>TO RIGHT REASON.</HI></Q> The truth of this doctrine is unque&s;tionable: for, if a <HI>parliament,</HI> or <HI>legi&s;lative power</HI> of any kind, (regal or popular,) pre&s;ume to enact ordinances which oppo&s;e, or in
<PB N="19" REF="18">
any re&s;pect &s;et a&s;ide, <HI>natural ju&s;tice,</HI> or <HI>the common right of innocent per&s;ons,</HI> and &s;hall claim an <HI>authority</HI> or <HI>privilege</HI> to do &s;o, (which is ignorantly and vainly cal|led <HI>omnipotence of parliament,</HI>) the &s;aid <HI>power</HI> cea&s;es to be a <HI>legal power,</HI> becau&s;e it ca&s;ts off the re&s;traint and government of God's indi&s;pen&s;able laws, and thereby becomes excommunicated from God! &mdash;<Q>Shall the throne of <HI>INIQUITY</HI> have fellow&s;hip with thee, which <HI>FRAMETH MISCHIEF BY A LAW?</HI></Q> (P&s;alm xciv. 20.)</P>
<P>A due con&s;ideration of this ought to re&s;train the modern rage of act-making! for it is laid down, in that ancient and re|&s;pectable law-book, called FLETA, that <Q> the power of <HI>RIGHT</HI> (<HI>or</HI> ju&s;tice) is of God alone, but the power of <HI>WRONG (or injury)</HI> is of the <HI>DEVIL;</HI> and the works of which&s;oever of the&s;e two,</Q> (viz. <HI>of God or of the devil,</HI>) <Q>he &s;hall
