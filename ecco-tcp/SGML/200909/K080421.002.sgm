<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON SEVERAL Parts of GREAT BRITAIN; PARTICULARLY THE HIGHLANDS of SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="21" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XXI.</HEAD>
<P>WE left the &s;cenes of Inverary with regret; tho&s;e &s;cenes, in which the grand and beautiful are as harmoniou&s;ly combined as we almo&s;t in any place remem|bered to have &s;een them. We approached it through magnificent woods; and we left it through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of lake-&s;cenery, &s;till more magnificent. Ten miles we travelled along the confines of Loch-Fyne, &s;kirting that grand opening, which it forms to the north ea&s;t.</P>
<P>It's &s;kreens are every where equal to the expan&s;e of it's waters. They are indeed chiefly
<PB N="2" REF="3">
naked, and want &s;ome munificent hand to &s;pread a little &s;ylvan drapery upon their bare, enormous &s;ides. But what they lo&s;e in beauty, they gain in grandeur.</P>
<P>Their &s;ituation al&s;o upon the lake operated as another cau&s;e, to impre&s;s the idea of grandeur. Nothing exalts the dignity of a mountain &s;o much, as it's ri&s;ing from the water's edge. In mea&s;uring it, as it appears connected with the ground, the eye knows not where to begin, but continues creeping up in que&s;t of a ba&s;e, till half the mountain is lo&s;t. But a water-line prevents this am|biguity; and to the height of the mountain even adds the edging at the bottom, which naturally belongs not to it. Thus the moun|tain of Doniquaick, &s;een from the new inn at Inverary, appears as if it ro&s;e from the water's edge, tho in fact the duke of Argyle's lawn intervenes, all which the mountain ap|propriates: and tho it mea&s;ures only eight hundred and thirty-five feet, it has a more re&s;pectable appearance, than many mountains of twice it's height unconnected with water.</P>
<P>But the&s;e &s;kreens, tho the grand idea is principally impre&s;&s;ed upon them, are not totally devoid of <HI>beauty.</HI> Two circum&s;tances

in a lake-&s;kreen produce this quality; the line, which it's <HI>&s;ummits</HI> form; and the <HI>water-line,</HI> which is formed by projections into the lake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this &s;ubject treated at large in Ob&s;ervations on the lakes and mountains of Cumberland, &amp;c. p. 82 and 95.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e modes of beauty we had great profu&s;ion; and might have filled volumes with &s;ketches: but unle&s;s there is &s;omething in a &s;cene be&s;ides the&s;e beautiful lines, &s;omething which is &s;triking, and characteri&s;tic, it has little effect, we have &s;een, in artificial land&s;cape.</P>
<P>Uncharacterized &s;cenery is &s;till le&s;s adapted to <HI>drawing,</HI> the beauty of which depends chiefly on compo&s;ition, and the di&s;tribution of light. In <HI>painting</HI> indeed, colouring may give it &s;ome value; but in <HI>drawing,</HI> &s;omething more in|tere&s;ting is required to fix the eye; &s;ome con&s;equential part, to which the other parts of the compo&s;ition are appendages.</P>
<P>In our whole ride round this exten&s;ive bay of Loch-Fyne, we met only one object of any con&s;equence to mark the &s;cenery. It was a ruined ca&s;tle upon a low penin&s;ula. The lake &s;pread in a bay before it, and behind it
<PB N="4" REF="6">
hung a grand curtain of di&s;tant mountains; one of which is marked with a peculiar feature &mdash;that of a va&s;t ridge &s;loping towards the eye.</P>
<P>We now approached the end of the lake; where, in the &s;eaman's phra&s;e, we <HI>raked</HI> a long reach of it. When we view it in this direction, and conceive our&s;elves at the head of a bay of &s;alt water, &s;ixty or &s;eventy fathoms deep, four miles in breadth, and at lea&s;t fifty from the &s;ea, we have a grand idea of the immen&s;e cavern, which is &s;cooped out between the&s;e ranges of mountains, as the receptacle of this bed of waters. If we could have &s;een it immediately after the diluvian cra&s;h, or whatever convul&s;ion of nature occa&s;ioned it, before the waters gu&s;hed in, what a horrid cha&s;m mu&s;t it have appeared!</P>
<P>Ideas of this kind &s;eem to explain a difficult pa&s;&s;age in Tacitus. In de&s;cribing the Cale|donian coa&s;t, he ob&s;erves that, <HI>Nu&s;quam latius dominari mare; multum fluminum huc, atque illuc ferre; nec litore tenus accre&s;cere, aut re&s;or|beri; &s;ed influere penitus, atque ambire, etiam jugis atque montibus in&s;eri, velut in &s;uo</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In vita Agric.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">Some explain this pa&s;&s;age, as if the &s;ea would &s;ometimes cover even the tops of the mountains. Others, among whom is the learned Gronovius, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In a note in his edition of Tacitus, which he &s;eems to ap|prove.</NOTE> laying the &s;tre&s;s upon the word <HI>ambire,</HI> and arbitrarily changing <HI>velut in &s;uo</HI> into <HI>velut in&s;ulis,</HI> make the &s;ea, in&s;tead of covering the mountains in it's rage, only to &s;urround them, and form them into i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Neither of the&s;e interpretations can well be the hi&s;torian's meaning, as they both imply the &s;ea to be in an agitated &s;tate: whereas he he had ju&s;t before told us, that the&s;e &s;eas were &s;carce ever known to be agitated. <HI>Pigrum, et grave remigantibus perhibent; ne ventis qui|dem proinde attolli:</HI> and this information he &s;eems him&s;elf to have believed; giving phy&s;ical rea&s;ons, &s;uch as they are, to a&s;certain it's probability. We are con&s;trained therefore to illu&s;trate this pa&s;&s;age in &s;ome &s;en&s;e exclu&s;ive of that dominion of the &s;ea, which it exerci&s;es in a &s;torm.</P>
<P>Two other &s;pecies of it's dominion over the land, &s;eem to be alluded to; the dominion of tides, and that dominion, which it &s;eems
<PB N="6" REF="8">
to a&s;&s;ert, by running up in creeks into the country. I &s;houd therefore tran&s;late the pa&s;&s;age thus: <HI>Over no country the &s;ea a&s;&s;erts more dominion. In various parts it meets the mouths of rivers; and not only wa&s;hes the &s;hores with the flux, and reflux of it's tides; but flows boldly up the country, winds round va&s;t &s;tretches of hills, and mountains; and makes deep inroads into the land, as if it were it's natural channel.</HI> &mdash;There cannot be a better comment upon this pa&s;&s;age, than the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Scot|land; which may in &s;ome degree therefore a&s;certain the truth of the tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>Having doubled the northern point of Loch-Fyne, we came to Carndow, which con&s;i&s;ts only of a few incon&s;iderable hou&s;es; and turning to the left, we pur&s;ued our rout in que&s;t of the &s;cenes of Loch-Lomond. Our road led through the valley of Kinlas, which is one of the wilde&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;ublime vallies we had yet met with. The two ranges of mountains, which form it's &s;kreens, ap|proach within two or three hundred yards. We were immured between them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a &s;cene of this kind de&s;cribed, in <HI>Ob&s;ervations on lakes, and mountains,</HI> &amp;c. vol. I. p. 209.</NOTE>. Moun|tains
<PB N="7" REF="9">
brought near the eye, like objects in a micro&s;cope, appear mon&s;trous. They require di&s;tance to give them &s;oftne&s;s; and remove deformities. But the&s;e mountains had few deformities to remove. They were magnificent; and yet well proportioned: bare of wood indeed, but rich from a varied and broken &s;urface.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Their contra&s;ts broad,</L>
<L>And carele&s;s lines, and undulating forms</L>
<L>Played through the varied &s;cene.</L></Q>
<P>Through the valley ran a &s;tream, tumbling violently over the rocky fragments, that op|po&s;ed it's cour&s;e: and to compleat the gran|deur of the whole, the &s;ky happened to harmonize with the mountains, &s;haping the clouds into tho&s;e grand forms, which Virgil calls the <HI>cava nubila coeli;</HI> and Shake&s;pear, &s;till more expre&s;&s;ively, <HI>the cloudy cheeks of heaven</HI>&mdash;tho&s;e &s;welling forms, which pre&s;ent &s;o &s;trongly the idea of puft cheeks. Shake|&s;pear's idea may be inelegant: but it is exact; and the forms them&s;elves are very picture&s;que.</P>
<P>It is a happy circum&s;tance, when we find a &s;ky thus &s;uited to a land&s;cape. In point of <HI>harmony of colouring</HI> the &s;ky and land&s;cape &s;eldom vary. The former generally impre&s;&s;es
<PB N="8" REF="10">
it's ruling tint on the latter. But the <HI>harmony of compo&s;ition</HI> is another point; and is not always &s;o exactly found. Tho the general tint of the &s;ky may be harmonious; the clouds may &s;till be ill formed, and unpicture&s;que. And it cannot be otherwi&s;e: for among all the appearances of nature, nothing a&s;&s;umes &s;uch variety of &s;hapes, as the&s;e floating bodies. Amid&s;t this variety there mu&s;t often be bad forms. The painter therefore takes care not only to impre&s;s the ruling tint of the &s;ky on his land&s;cape; but al&s;o to get a good modu|lation of the &s;ky, in that key, if I may &s;o &s;peak, which he hath cho&s;en.</P>
<P>No preci&s;e rules in the choice of a &s;ky can be given: nor in the adapting of &s;kies to land&s;cape. This latter e&s;pecially is matter of ta&s;te rather, than of rule. In general, clouds in large ma&s;&s;es, like tho&s;e, which gave oc|ca&s;ion to the&s;e remarks, are more beautiful, than when they are frittered. Large &s;welling fleecy clouds on a blue &s;ky are often beautiful. A few light floating clouds (yet rather con|tiguous,) in one part of the &s;ky; when the other part is of a uniform tint, has the effect of contra&s;t. It is a beautiful &s;pecies of &s;ky al&s;o, when the dark part melts gradually into
<PB N="9" REF="11">
the lighter: and this may be carried to the highe&s;t degree of contra&s;t in a &s;torm. Breaks al&s;o in the &s;ky, when you &s;ee a light part through the di&s;parting of dark clouds, are plea&s;ing. And one or other of the&s;e &s;pecies may be &s;uited to all land&s;cape. The full meridian &s;un, and clear etherial &s;ky, are &s;el|dom cho&s;en. The painter commonly choo&s;es his &s;kies in a morning, or evening; which he thinks will inlighten his picture to the be&s;t advantage, and give it the mo&s;t brillian|cy. Of one thing he &s;hould be very care|ful; and that is to avoid all &s;hapes of animals, or other objects, into which clouds are &s;ome|times apt to form them&s;elves. I have &s;een a good picture &s;poiled from having the clouds formed in the &s;hape of a &s;wan. From this mi&s;chief Shake&s;pear may guard us.</P>
<Q><L>Sometimes you &s;ee a cloud, that's dragoni&s;h:</L>
<L>A vapour &s;ometimes like a bear, or lion;</L>
<L>A tow'red citadel, a pendent rock;</L>
<L>A forked mountain; or blue promontory</L>
<L>With trees upon't, that nod, and mock the eye</L>
<L>With empty air.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Having travelled two or three miles in the valley of Kinlas, we found the end of it clo&s;ed by the &s;kirts of a mountain, which the road
<PB N="10" REF="12">
a&s;cends. Here the river, (which in the valley, was only a violent &s;tream) de&s;cends in a rougher manner, through the &s;everal &s;tages of the mountain; and &s;weetened the toil of our a&s;cent, which was made on foot, by exhibiting cataracts, and water-falls in great variety. At the &s;ummit, we found a &s;mall lake, which was the re&s;ervoir of all the&s;e beautiful exhibitions. The road we travelled, is a miltary one; and has been made at great expence of labour. The toil it co&s;t &s;eems expre&s;&s;ed by a &s;igh in an in&s;cription on a &s;tone-&s;eat at the top, <HI>Re&s;t, and be thankful!</HI></P>
<P>The de&s;cent, on the other &s;ide, is a direct precipice: but a zig-zag road is contrived, which is pa&s;&s;able enough. This road brought us into Glen-Croey; which is a &s;cene of peculiar con&s;truction.</P>
<P>Glen-Croey is a valley, which &s;eemed to us about two miles in length, tho it may be longer, well proportioned in it's dimen&s;ions; and &s;kreened, on every &s;ide by mountains as magnificent, and as finely formed, as tho&s;e we had pa&s;&s;ed: but it's peculiarity is this, that altho in the neighbourhood of the wilde&s;t,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
and mo&s;t rugged &s;cenes, yet (contrary to the u&s;ual mode in which nature unites contiguous land&s;cape) it is totally &s;mooth, and almo&s;t poli&s;hed. The bottom of the valley con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of fine pa&s;turage, which cloaths al&s;o the &s;ides of the mountains. The &s;oftne&s;s of the herbage upon their di&s;tant &s;ides, appeared like a rich, &s;preading, velvet mantle. Here and there the broken channel of a torrent had formed gutters in the declivities; but in general, all was quiet, and unbroken. Had this valley, and it's lofty &s;kreens been planted, the &s;cene would have been delightful. The grandeur of the valley of Kinlas could &s;upport it&s;elf independent of wood: but the valley of Croey, inclining rather to the beautiful, than to the &s;ublime, is not complete without that accompaniment.</P>
<P>In the middle of the vale &s;tands a lonely cottage, &s;heltered with a few trees, and adorn|ed with it's little orchard, and other appen|dages. We might call it a &s;eat of empire. Here re&s;ides the hind, who manages, and overlooks the cattle, which in numerous herds, graze this fertile vale: and if peace, and quietne&s;s inhabit not his humble man&s;ion, it does
<PB N="12" REF="14">
not harmonize with the &s;cene, to which it belongs.</P>
<P>From the valley of Croey we &s;oon reached the banks of <HI>Loch-Loung,</HI> or <HI>the lake of &s;hips,</HI> another &s;alt-water lake; in which, according to the geography of Tacitus, the &s;ea is wont <HI>influere penitus, atque ambire, etiam jugis, atque montibus in&s;eri, velut in &s;uo.</HI></P>
<P>In the account I have given of the two vallies, which lye between Loch-Fyne, and Loch-Loung, I have de&s;cribed the fir&s;t as rough; and the latter, which is the valley of Croey, as &s;mooth. I &s;hould not however conceal, that I have &s;een the journal of a late traveller, which inverts this order. It makes the valley of Kinlas pa&s;turage; and Croey, it de&s;cribes as rocky. I dare not take upon me to &s;ay, I have made no mi&s;take. I can only &s;ay, that my minutes were taken on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Loch-Loung oppo&s;ed our farther pa&s;&s;age by it's extremity, which formed the point of a bay. This bay we &s;kirted with &s;o much plea&s;ure, that we could have wi&s;hed the interruption had been greater. As we
<PB REF="15">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="13" REF="16">
approach the vertical point, it ro&s;e in value, exhibiting a &s;imple, and very &s;ublime piece of lake-&s;cenery. Upon it's &s;hores and rocks lie &s;ea-weed, &s;hells, and other marks of a tide; with alone &s;hew it to be &s;alt-water; for it's banks have all the verdure, and vegeta|tion of an inland-lake.</P>
<P>From the confines of Loch-Loung, we had a &s;hort ride to Tarbet, which &s;tands upon Loch-Lomond; the &s;cene we had &s;o long expected. <HI>Tarbet</HI> is a common name in Scotland for a town &s;eated on an i&s;thmus between two lakes; which is the &s;ituation of this place; a mere neck of land dividing Loch-Loung from Loch-Lomond. Some &s;up|po&s;e the word <HI>Tarbet,</HI> to &s;ignify the &s;ame as a <HI>Carrying-place</HI> in America. Here the &s;cenes of Loch-Lomond opened before us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="22" TYPE="section">
<PB N="15" REF="17">
<HEAD>SECT. XXII.</HEAD>
<P>LOCH-LOMOND is a fre&s;h water lake; about twenty-four miles in length. It's northern end is narrow, running up a con|&s;iderable way, among lofty mountains: but it widens towards the &s;outh by degrees; and attains a great breadth. Some &s;ay it's &s;urface is ob&s;erved gradually to increa&s;e; and pre|tend to &s;hew the ruins of buildings far in the waters, when they are in a tran&s;parent &s;tate. But we &s;aw nothing of the kind.&mdash; As this lake has ever been e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t celebrated &s;cenes in Scotland, it will be proper to dwell a little upon it.</P>
<P>Tarbet lies upon the narrower part of the lake, from whence we took our rout to Lu&s;s, which commands the broader. The road accompanies the lake; and is exceedingly grand, and generally lofty, in every part.
<PB N="16" REF="18">
Water, and mountains are the removed part of the &s;cene: rocks and hanging woods adorn the foreground, among which, at every turn of the road, the lake appears to much advan|tage. The whole road is exactly that path upon the grand &s;cale of nature, which is pre&s;cribed in the improvements of art:
<Q><L>&mdash;that path, from whence, the &s;ight is led</L>
<L>Gradual to view the whole. Where'er thou wind&s;t</L>
<L>That line, take heed between the &s;cene, and eye,</L>
<L>To vary, and to mix thy cho&s;en greens.</L>
<L>Here for a while with cedar, or with larch,</L>
<L>(That from the ground &s;pread their clo&s;e texture,) hide</L>
<L>The view entire. Then o'er &s;ome lowly tuft,</L>
<L>Where ro&s;e and woodbine bloom, permit it's charms</L>
<L>To bur&s;t upon the &s;ight. Now through a cop&s;e</L>
<L>Of beech, that rear their &s;mooth, and &s;tately trunks,</L>
<L>Admit it partially; and half exclude,</L>
<L>And half reveal it's graces. In this path,</L>
<L>How long &s;oe'er the wanderer roves, each &s;tep</L>
<L>Shall wake fre&s;h beauties; each &s;hort point pre&s;ent</L>
<L>A different picture, now, and yet the &s;ame.</L></Q></P>
<P>This road is one of the grand entrances into the highlands; and a very formidable one it is. It runs along the &s;ide of a moun|tain, and is in many parts a mere precipice hanging over the lake; and tho &s;ecured &s;uf|ficiently for travellers, is &s;till a dangerous defile for an army. The difficulty of making
<PB N="17" REF="19">
it has been great. In &s;everal parts it is cut through the &s;olid rock, which is left as a pavement; and the grateful traveller finds him&s;elf indebted (as an in&s;cription with Roman brevity informs him) to the labours of Colonel La&s;celles's regiment.</P>
<P>About three miles from Tarbet, where the road ri&s;es, we have a grand retro&s;pect of the narrow part of the lake. A mountain, on the left, near the eye, runs boldly into the water; beyond which the lake retires, bay after bay, in per&s;pective, among di&s;tant moun|tains into it's deep rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The colouring of the&s;e mountains was very beautiful. It was an early hour: the &s;un ju&s;t ri&s;ing had not &s;trength to di&s;&s;ipate the blue mi&s;ts, which hung upon them; but yet it's faint radiance, here and there, tinged their broken points, and &s;hed an effu&s;ion of the &s;oft|e&s;t, and mo&s;t delicate light. The effect too was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the waters of the lake, which in &s;ome parts were &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hable from the ba&s;e of the mountains.</P>
<P>There is a pa&s;&s;age in the prophet Joel, which I think nobly de&s;criptive of &s;uch a &s;cene as this. He is de&s;cribing the day, in which the Lord cometh to execute judgment.
<PB N="18" REF="20">
<HI>It is a day,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>of darkne&s;s, and gloomine&s;s &mdash;a day of clouds, and thick darkne&s;s&mdash;as the morning &s;pread upon the mountains.</HI></P>
<P>Having been always therefore plea&s;ed with this pa&s;&s;age, particularly the la&s;t clau&s;e of it, as a piece of &s;ublime, and picture&s;que imagery, I was not a little di&s;appointed in finding it animadverted on by &s;o able a critic, as the bi&s;hop of London, in his excellent tran&s;lation of I&s;aiah <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his note on I&s;. viii. 20.</NOTE>. He allows the <HI>morning</HI> to be the <HI>u&s;ual</HI> &s;en&s;e of the Hebrew word in this place: but as the &s;ame word al&s;o &s;ignifies <HI>gloom,</HI> he rather prefers that word here, becau&s;e the <HI>morning,</HI> he thinks, is an <HI>incongruous idea.</HI></P>
<P>If the bi&s;hop had ever paid any attention to the effects of morning-lights in a mountain|ous country (which the prophet, who had always lived in &s;uch a country, probably did,) he would not perhaps have taxed the vul|gar tran&s;lation of this pa&s;&s;age with <HI>incongruity.</HI> By a very ea&s;y, and elegant metonymy, the morning, which is the <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> may &s;tand for that <HI>brightened gloom,</HI> which is the <HI>effect.</HI>&mdash; If, on the other hand, we under&s;tand by
<PB REF="21">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="19" REF="22">
the <HI>morning</HI> only a <HI>gloom,</HI> the &s;entiment gains nothing. It is a mere repetition.</P>
<P>I would not be &s;uppo&s;ed to di&s;pute a point of critici&s;m with &s;o great a ma&s;ter as the bi&s;hop of London; but I may without vanity, &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf better acquainted with the effects of morning-lights in a mountainous country; and may therefore be allowed to &s;ay, that <HI>the morning &s;pread upon the mountains,</HI> is, at lea&s;t not an incongruous expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>At Lu&s;s we got into a boat, and rowed to the middle of the lake, where we lay upon our oars to take a view of the &s;cenery around us.</P>
<P>To the north we looked far up the narrow channel of the lake, which we had ju&s;t &s;een from the &s;hore. We were now more in the cen|ter of the view. But the &s;cene was now &s;hifted. It was more a vi&s;ta. The mountains &s;helved beautifully into the water, on both &s;ides; and the bottom of the lake was occupied by Ben-vorlie, which filled it's &s;tation with great di&s;tinction. On the right, Ben-lomond, the &s;econd hill in Scotland, rai&s;ed it's re&s;pectable head. While the waters at their ba&s;e, were

dark, like a black, tran&s;parent mirror. But in this point of view the form of Ben-lomond was rather injured by the regularity of it's line, which con&s;i&s;ts of three &s;tages of a&s;cent. In general however, this mountain appears finely &s;loped; and it's &s;urface beautifully bro|ken.</P>
<P>Ben-lomond mea&s;ures in height between three and four thou&s;and feet from the &s;urface of the lake, extending it's &s;kirts far, and wide into the country. It's lofty &s;ides are &s;ubject to various climates; and maintain various inhabitants. The ptarmigan, and other heath-fowls frequent it's upper regions: it's lower are &s;aught, as a favourite haunt, by the roe-buck: while the many irriguous val|lies, and &s;heltered pa&s;tures at it's ba&s;e, tempt the pea&s;ants of the country to &s;ettle among them.</P>
<P>By this time the early hours of &s;un-ri&s;e had pa&s;&s;ed away. The <HI>morning &s;pread upon the mountains</HI>&mdash;tho&s;e velvet lights, which we had &s;een from the Tarbet-road, had now taken a more vivid hue; and the vapours forming a more tran&s;parent medium, began to di&s;cover through their thinner veil a fine purple tint,
<PB N="21" REF="24">
which had over&s;pread the tops of the moun|tains; and is one of the mo&s;t beautiful of all the hues, that inve&s;t tho&s;e lofty &s;tations. Pou&s;&s;in is &s;o fond of it, that in general, I think, he throws too much purple into his di&s;tances: and the imagination of Virgil could conceive nothing beyond it in the Ely&s;ian fields, where he tells us that a brighter &s;un &s;preads it's radiance upon the mountains;
<Q><L>&mdash;et lumine ve&s;tit</L>
<L>Purpureo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purpureus often &s;ignifies, <HI>&s;hining,</HI> or <HI>glowing;</HI> but it is often de&s;criptive of colour al&s;o, and &s;ignifies <HI>purple.</HI> Thus Horace &s;peaks of <HI>purpurit tyranni;</HI> and Ovid of <HI>purpureus pudor.</HI> And where the term is applied to the colouring of a mountain, I cannot conceive it can mean any thing but <HI>purple.</HI></NOTE>&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>The view to the &s;outh has le&s;s value in <HI>a picture&s;que light.</HI> The &s;urface of the lake is broken by a number of i&s;lands, which are &s;cattered about it, and prevent all <HI>unity of compo&s;ition.</HI> It's banks al&s;o, in that direction, are tame &s;cenes of pa&s;turage, and cultivation; and the mountains, which &s;kreened it's north|ern regions, are here removed.

<P>ON the we&s;tern &s;ide of the lake, is an i&s;land, called Devannoc; which ri&s;es at one end into a lofty hill. To this i&s;land we &s;teered; and mooring our bark in a creek, we a&s;cended the hill under the conduct of our boatman, who was a very intelligent guide. The a&s;cent co&s;t us a full half-hour; and we thought it &s;omewhat extraordinary to find a hill of &s;uch dimen&s;ions upon an i&s;land in a lake. When we gained the &s;ummit we &s;eated our&s;elves upon a rock cu&s;hioned with mo&s;s, and heath; and as the day was fine, we had indeed a mo&s;t amu&s;ing view over all the &s;outh|ern divi&s;ion of the lake.</P>
<P>A va&s;t expan&s;e of water, at lea&s;t ten miles in diameter, lay before the eye, inter&s;per&s;ed with various i&s;lands of different forms, and dimen&s;ions. Among the&s;e the little barks,
<PB N="24" REF="28">
which navigated the lake, and plied among the &s;everal channels, appeared and di&s;appeared by turns; dividing portions of land into i&s;lands, which to the eye &s;eemed united.</P>
<P>The i&s;land (or <HI>inch</HI> according to the Er&s;e) which lay neare&s;t to us is Ghenaghan. It is an i&s;land of con&s;iderable extent; being not le&s;s than a mile in length. It con&s;i&s;ts of great variety of high ground; and is every where woody. On the hither &s;ide it is in|dented by a large &s;emicircular bay; which gives it a peculiar appearance.</P>
<P>Beyond Ghenaghan lies Inch-Crune, about half a mile in length; flat, unwooded, and covered chiefly with pa&s;turage.</P>
<P>Inch-Fad lies in the &s;ame direction, beyond Crune; and is nearly of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions; flat al&s;o, and unwooded.</P>
<P>To the &s;outh, between Crune, and Ghen|aghan, lies Moin, one of the large&s;t i&s;lands in the lake. It is flat; it's &s;hores are much indented; one half of it con&s;i&s;ts of pa&s;turage, and the other of a peat-mo&s;s.</P>
<P>Beyond Inch-Fad, verging towards the ea&s;t|ern &s;ide of the lake, lies Inch Calloch, or the <HI>I&s;le of Nuns;</HI> which is about a mile in length. It con&s;i&s;ts of high ground, and is
<PB N="25" REF="29">
very woody; but the eye at &s;o great a di&s;|tance, could not di&s;tingui&s;h the indenting of it's &s;hores. This i&s;land, which is regularly inhabited, is in this re&s;pect of greater dignity than any other upon the lake. It is remark|able al&s;o on another account. The clan of M'greggors, who occupied the mountainous limits on the north of the lake, and were pro&s;cribed by an act of parliament, for their thefts and rapine, had among them one very egregious &s;uper&s;tition, which was to lay their bones in this i&s;land, where &s;till appear the remains of a holy-hou&s;e. Accordingly they have all been buried here from time imme|morial; pre&s;uming, no doubt, (as men, in all ages, &s;eem from &s;acrifices, or other rites, to have had &s;ome idea of atonement) that the &s;anctity of the ground would deprecate the guilt of their lives.</P>
<P>There is another rea&s;on however given for burying in i&s;lands; which is practi&s;ed al&s;o in other parts of Scotland. When the country abounded with wolves, it is &s;aid, the&s;e animals would often attack church-yards; again&s;t which the people guarded by in&s;ular graves. Thus a practice founded in nece&s;&s;ity, might have been continued through &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="30">To the &s;outhward of M'greggor's i&s;le, lie Grange, and Torremach, each of which i&s;lands is about half a mile in length: both are woody, but Torremach con&s;i&s;ts of higher ground.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame direction, lies the i&s;land of Merin, the large&s;t upon the lake; being two Scotch miles in length, which are nearly equal to three of Engli&s;h mea&s;ure. It's breadth al&s;o is proportionable, mea&s;uring above a mile from one &s;ide to the other. This i&s;land, which is very woody, and con&s;i&s;ts of high, irregular ground, is converted into a park, by the duke of Montro&s;e. The keeper, and his family, are the only inhabitants, which it contains. Formerly this i&s;land was a place of more note, and was dignified with a noble man&s;ion, built by the duke of Lenox.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of M'greggor's i&s;land, towards the north, lies Inch-Lonac, formed in the &s;hape of a cre&s;cent; with &s;ome wood upon it, but more heath. This al&s;o is a con&s;iderable i&s;land; being near two miles in length. It is the property of Sir James Col|quhoun, who has turned it into a deer-park. &mdash;Commodious as the&s;e &s;ituations &s;eem for deer, a good paling is a better fence than a
<PB N="27" REF="31">
lake, however deep. Often a herd, banding together, will venture through this va&s;t expan&s;e of waters, in que&s;t of better pa&s;turage: and it is one of the mo&s;t laborious parts of the keeper's employment, to pur&s;ue the emigrants, and drive them home.</P>
<P>In an oppo&s;ite direction lies Inch-Galbrith. This i&s;land the o&s;prey-eagle inhabits, in prefer|ence to any other on the lake: but for what par|ticular advantages, the naturali&s;t is ignorant. From his re&s;idence here he &s;ends out his rapa|cious colonies. Fi&s;h is his prey: but nature hath neither given him the power to &s;wim, nor the art to dive. She has furni&s;hed him however with powers, equally de&s;tructive. With a keen eye he hovers over the lake; and &s;eeing from a great height, &s;ome inadvertent fi&s;h near the &s;urface, he darts rapidly upon it; and plung|ing his talons, and brea&s;t, if need be, into the water, keeps his pinions aloof in the air, undipped; on the &s;trength of which he &s;prings upwards with his prey, tho it is &s;ometimes very bulky. The o&s;prey differs little from the &s;ea-eagle; only he is more, what is com|monly termed, a <HI>fre&s;h-water pirate.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e larger i&s;lands, there are others of &s;maller dimen&s;ions; which are too numerous
<PB N="28" REF="32">
for particular notice. In any other place they would make a figure; but here we con&s;ider them only as garni&s;h to the re&s;t. We counted eighteen i&s;lands di&s;tinctly lying before us; but we were told there are not fewer than thirty &s;cattered over the lake; three of which have churches upon them, tho, I believe, now in ruins.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e i&s;lands is ob&s;erved alternately to &s;ink, and ri&s;e. This is a common &s;tory among lakes; and the my&s;tery of it generally is, that the water, tho it's apparent form is rarely altered, is yet &s;ometimes &s;o high, as to cover an i&s;land, which happens to be very flat. I have heard however well atte&s;ted &s;tories of i&s;lands, in &s;ome lakes, that really ri&s;e and &s;ink. This may po&s;&s;ibly be owing to fungous earth dilated by vegetation, and detaching it&s;elf by it's lightne&s;s from the bot|tom. As it's vegetation cea&s;es, and it becomes of cour&s;e more compre&s;&s;ed, and more &s;aturated with water, it lo&s;es it's buoyancy, and &s;inks. The fact I believe is unque&s;tioned; but I will not pretend to &s;ay, that this &s;olution accounts &s;ufficiently for it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, there is another kind of float|ing i&s;land, which hath been &s;ometimes &s;een
<PB N="29" REF="33">
upon this lake, and hath confounded the eye of travellers; and that is a &s;ort of raft, which the inhabitants u&s;ed to make of a con&s;iderable &s;ize, fa&s;tening the &s;hafts of &s;everal pines toge|ther, and covering them with earth, and clods. The&s;e rafts were u&s;eful on many occa&s;ions. I believe they are not now in u&s;e; as boats are much more manageable, and commodious. But in elder times, the raft was the fir&s;t &s;pecies of lake-navigation. On it the inha|bitants u&s;ed to tran&s;port their cattle, hay, or any other bulky commodity, from one part of the lake to another. But the raft was principally of u&s;e in times of alarm. When an adver&s;e clan was laying wa&s;te the country, &s;ome poor highlander would &s;hip his family, and moveables on board a raft; and running under the lee of an i&s;land, would attach him|&s;elf to it. His raft at a di&s;tance would appear a part of the i&s;land it&s;elf, and lie concealed. In the mean time he would rear a low hut of boughs, and heath, again&s;t the oak, to which he was moored; and would eat his oaten bread, the only provi&s;ion he carried with him, and drink of the lake, till a time of &s;ecurity gave him liberty to return.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="34">We were a&s;&s;ured however, that in a part of the country, where we had lately been, in the road between Killin and Tindrum, there is a lake, where a real floating i&s;land, which never &s;inks, continues always &s;hifting about the lake. We did not &s;ee it; but we were told, it is formed of the matted roots of a particular kind of weed. It's &s;urface, which is now about forty-five yards in cir|cumference, is &s;uppo&s;ed rather to increa&s;e. If you bore it, in three or four feet you come at water. Sometimes, as it re&s;ts near the &s;hore, the wild cattle are tempted in|to it by a little fre&s;h gra&s;s. But it is a dangerous bait. If the wind &s;hift, they may be carried off into unknown regions, from all their kindred and acquaintance; or as their provi&s;ion is &s;canty, if the voyage prove long, they may &s;uffer greatly by hunger.</P>
<P>I&s;lands of this kind were perhaps more common in ancient times. The younger Pliny at lea&s;t gives us an account of &s;everal, which he had &s;een dancing about the Vadimonian lake, in a very extraordinary manner. <HI>Inter|dum junctae, copulataeque, et continenti &s;imiles &s;unt.

<P>Be&s;ides the i&s;lands in Loch-Lomond, there are many penin&s;ulas, which run into it, and add greatly to the variety of the &s;cene. Of the&s;e, the mo&s;t remarkable is that, on which Sir James Colquhoun has his re&s;idence. His &s;eat, and plantations were a great ornament to our view.</P>
<P>The country immediately beyond the i&s;lands, appeared flat, and the mountains were too far removed to be of any picture&s;que u&s;e from the hill of Devannoc, where we &s;tood. Among other objects of di&s;tance, a &s;trange form at|tracted our notice. It was &s;omething like a hou&s;e, only infinitely bigger, than any hou&s;e, at that di&s;tance could po&s;&s;ibly appear. Upon enquiry we found it was the rock, on which the ca&s;tle of Dunbarton &s;tands. Our expec|tation was of cour&s;e greatly rai&s;ed, to &s;ee an object on the &s;pot, which had excited our curio&s;ity &s;o much at a di&s;tance.</P>

<P>HIGH places, and extended views have ever been propitious to the excur&s;ions of imagination. As we &s;urveyed the &s;cene before us, which was an amu&s;ing, but un|peopled &s;urface, it was natural to con&s;ider it under the idea of population.</P>
<P>If commerce and wealth are the great means of improving the human mind, by commu|nicating knowledge&mdash;freeing it from prejudice &mdash;giving it a more liberal turn&mdash;encouraging letters&mdash;and introducing arts; they as certainly at a riper period, introduce corruption, and become the handmaids of vice. How happy then would it be to drop them at this critical period; to arre&s;t the preci&s;e time, when they have done their utmo&s;t to enlighten mankind, and then di&s;card them. But it would be as
<PB N="34" REF="37">
ea&s;y to arre&s;t the cour&s;e of the river. Human affairs, like the plants of the field, flouri&s;h only to decay: they are longer lived indeed; but the hope of pre&s;erving them in a &s;tate of perfection, would be the futile hope of im|mortalizing mortality.</P>
<P>In a reverie however we may conceive the happine&s;s of a few philo&s;ophical friends, re|tiring from the follies of life to &s;uch a &s;cene as this; and &s;ettling them&s;elves in the &s;everal i&s;lands, that are &s;cattered about the lake before us. Their happine&s;s would con&s;i&s;t in the refined plea&s;ures of intercour&s;e, and &s;olitude. The vi&s;ionary does not con&s;ider the many econo|mical difficulties and inconveniences of a plan. All the&s;e things are below his no|tice. He enjoys in idea the plea&s;ure of a refined, and virtuous &s;ociety. He fea&s;ts on the agreeable expectation that would ari&s;e at the &s;ight of a &s;ail making to his little retreat, which he would know was fraught with wit &mdash;or cla&s;&s;ic elegance&mdash;or the refinements of ta&s;te&mdash;or philo&s;ophy&mdash;or the charms of an unaffected piety. The contents of the cargo would be known at a di&s;tance from the di|rection, in which the ve&s;&s;el came.&mdash;Nor would the hours of &s;olitude pa&s;s with le&s;s
<PB N="35" REF="38">
delight. However plea&s;ing the charms of conver&s;e, each member of this virtuous, and happy &s;ociety, would &s;till be his own be&s;t companion. He who wants re&s;ources within him&s;elf, can never find happine&s;s abroad.</P>
<P>Among the amu&s;ements of this happy peo|ple, it would not be the lea&s;t to improve their little territories into &s;cenes of &s;implicity, and beauty&mdash;academic groves, Ely&s;ian fields;
<Q><L>Where they, whom wi&s;dom, and whom nature charm,</L>
<L>Stealing them&s;elves from the degenerate croud,</L>
<L>May &s;ooth the throbbing pa&s;&s;ions into peace,</L>
<L>And woo lone quiet in her &s;ilent walks.</L></Q></P>
<P>Even the drearine&s;s of winter would not want it's enjoyments. Winter is the reign of dome&s;tic plea&s;ures; and if the &s;torms of the lake forbad the adventitious intercour&s;e of agreeable &s;ociety, they would at lea&s;t remove the impertinent interruptions of what was not &s;o. The intru&s;ions of a tattling world would be totally excluded: while books, and ele|gant amu&s;ements, would be a &s;overeign anti|dote again&s;t the howling of winds, and the beating of waves.&mdash;But enough of the&s;e idle reveries, which belong not to terre&s;trial things.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="39">When we de&s;cended the rocky hill, from which we had the&s;e amu&s;ing views, we &s;ur|veyed the whole i&s;land of Devannoc. It &s;eems to be one of the mo&s;t beautiful on the lake; and admirably adapted to be the &s;eat of &s;ome capital man&s;ion in &s;uch a &s;cene, as we have ju&s;t imagined. It cannot be le&s;s than two Engli&s;h miles in length; and tho at the north|ern end it is woody, rough, and even moun|tainous, as we have &s;een; it's &s;outhern end affords both corn and pa&s;turage. We ob&s;erved however but one &s;olitary farm upon the whole place.</P>
<P>Embarking again we &s;pent &s;ome hours in rowing among that clump of i&s;lands, which lie neare&s;t the eye; and in looking into their little creeks, and bays; tho we did not land on any of them. Standing then for the &s;hore, we met our hor&s;es about five miles below the place, where we at fir&s;t embarked.</P>
<P>Loch-lomond was never known to freeze. Partially indeed it has been &s;ometimes frozen at the &s;outhern end; but never in any degree, &s;ince the memory of man, except in the year 1740. But the northern part, which runs
<PB N="37" REF="40">
up among the mountains, was never known at any time to receive even the &s;lighte&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion from the fro&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;outhern part of Loch-lomond is much frequented by &s;almon; tho in general this fi&s;h is not fond of lakes. But the ca&s;e is this. The river Leven forms the chief exit of the lake; and communicates with the &s;ea. In a direction nearly oppo&s;ite to the Leven, the river Ennery enters the lake. Of this river the &s;almon is particularly fond; and enter|ing by the Leven, he traver&s;es the lake on purpo&s;e to proceed up the Ennery. By what in&s;tinct he knows that he &s;hall find the &s;tream he delights in, acro&s;s &s;o va&s;t an expan&s;e of waters, let the naturali&s;t &s;ay. Do the waters of the Ennery run pure through the lake to the Leven? Or does the old &s;almon, which hath once found the way, di&s;cover it to the &s;hoal? Or, &s;hall we con|fe&s;s our ignorance; and &s;uppo&s;e them guided by &s;ome in&s;tinct, which we cannot com|prehend?</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that at the beginning of November, 1755, when the city of Li&s;bon was de&s;troyed by an earthquake, this lake
<PB N="38" REF="41">
was exceedingly agitated. The day was perfect|ly calm, and it's &s;urface &s;till, when it's waters aro&s;e &s;uddenly many feet in large &s;wells, and overflowed a con&s;iderable di&s;trict. Then in a moment or two retiring, they &s;ank as much below their u&s;ual mark. Their next flow, and ebb were le&s;s than the former; but &s;till very great: and thus they continued ri&s;ing, and &s;inking for &s;everal hours; till the fluctuation gradually &s;ub&s;iding, the waters at length &s;ettled within their common bounds. A boat, which was thrown upon dry land, was found by men|&s;uration, to be forty yards from it's &s;tation in the lake: and in &s;ome places, where the land was low, the waters ru&s;hed away, and overflowed the country for a con&s;iderable ex|tent. Similar remarks were made at that time on other lakes.</P>
<P>Since the year in which the&s;e ob&s;ervations were written, an agitation in Loch-Tay was &s;till more remarkable than this in Loch-lomond; becau&s;e no earthquake, nor any other probable cau&s;e could be a&s;&s;igned for it. It happened on &s;unday the 12th of &s;eptember 1784. That day, and the preceding day, as in the former ca&s;e, were calm; and the waters of the lake of cour&s;e perfectly &s;till; when, about nine o'clock in the morning, a &s;trange agi|tation
<PB N="39" REF="42">
was ob&s;erved in that part of the lake, which &s;preads into a bay, before the village of Kenmore<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a de&s;cription of Loch-Tay, vol. I. p. 153.</NOTE>. Great part of it is &s;hallow: but a little before it unites with the body of the lake, it becomes very deep. In this bay the agitation was fir&s;t ob&s;erved: the water retired &s;everal yards within it's u&s;ual boundary; and, as it did in Loch-lomond, immediately flowed back again; continuing to ebb, and flow in the &s;ame manner, three or four times, during the &s;pace of a quarter of an hour&mdash;when &s;uddenly the waters ru&s;hed from the ea&s;t, and we&s;t with great violence, and meeting in the place, where the &s;hallow waters and the deep unite, aro&s;e in the form of a great wave, in appearance at lea&s;t five feet high; leaving all the &s;hores of the bay dry for the &s;pace of an hundred yards, as nearly as could be conjectured. The meeting of the two currents made a cla&s;hing &s;ound: but the force of that from the Kenmore-&s;ide overpowering the other, carried the wave we&s;t|ward. It continued decrea&s;ing, as it proceeded; and in about five minutes di&s;appeared. How
<PB N="40" REF="43">
great the force of the water was on the Ken|more-&s;ide, tho collected only from the &s;hallow part, appeared from it's overflowing it's natural boundary, as the waves &s;ub&s;ided, &s;everal yards, notwith&s;tanding the chief part of the current went the other way. After this violent agitation, the water did not recover it's tranquillity for &s;ome time. It continued eb|bing and flowing, but with le&s;s and le&s;s force, at the interval of &s;even or eight minutes, during the &s;pace of at lea&s;t two hours, after the &s;ub&s;iding of the great wave.</P>
<P>While the waters of the lake were thus agitated, the river Tay, which i&s;&s;ues from the lake at Kenmore, ran backwards into it with &s;o much force, as to leave it's &s;hores and in &s;ome parts, it's channel, quite dry. It was curious to &s;ee the weeds, which grow at the bottom, and are &s;moothed by the &s;tream, flowing over them; all bri&s;tling up, and pointing in a contrary direction.</P>
<P>On the day after this violent agitation of Loch-Tay, and on the four following days, the waters were di&s;turbed again in the &s;ame manner, and about the &s;ame time; but in a much le&s;s degree: nor did tho&s;e commotions intirely cea&s;e for a full month afterwards;
<PB N="41" REF="44">
but they became very irregular, &s;ometimes appearing in the morning, and &s;ometimes in the evening. The 15th of october was the la&s;t day, on which any di&s;turbance was ob|&s;erved on the lake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account is taken from a letter written by the rev.

<P>FROM the &s;cenes of Loch-lomond we made the be&s;t of our way to Dunbarton. The lake bore us company on the left, during mo&s;t of the road, appearing and di&s;appearing, by turns, among the woods, which &s;hade it's banks. The country is level, cultivated, and adorned with gentlemen's &s;eats. Near the road &s;tands a pillar erected to the memory of the late Dr. Smollet.</P>
<P>The principal object, during our ride along the banks of Loch-lomond, is Dunbarton-ca&s;tle, which &s;till maintains that uncommon form, which it fir&s;t exhibited. You begin now to di&s;tingui&s;h it plainly into two parts, one of which appears like a va&s;t tent. This appearance continues &s;ome time; but as we approach nearer, certain prominences, which have a ca&s;tle-like form, indicate the whole to be a ma&s;s of fortified rock.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="47">A &s;till nearer approach gives more di&s;tinctne&s;s of cour&s;e to it's enormous features. One of it's &s;ummits appears now higher, and more pointed than the other; and is adorned with a &s;olitary watch-tower. The broader &s;ummit is occupied by the principal part of the ca&s;tle: and a wall, flanked with towers, fortifies the cleft between them. This whole grand object comes in as a &s;econd di&s;tance; and the Clyde, &s;kreened by mountains, completes the picture, by forming a third.</P>
<P>When we arrive upon the &s;pot, the &s;ituation of Dunbarton ca&s;tle appears indeed &s;urprizing. A va&s;t rock, &s;teep on every &s;ide, ri&s;ing out of a plain, and unconnected with any high ground for the &s;pace of a mile, is one of tho&s;e exhibitions, which nature rarely pre&s;ents. It is almo&s;t &s;urrounded on the north, the we&s;t, and the &s;outh, by the Leven, and the Clyde; which latter is here a grand e&s;tuary. On the ea&s;t lies a mora&s;s.</P>
<P>Such a rock as this, is as uncommon at land, as it is common at &s;ea. When the tides of the ocean, gaining upon &s;ome continent, force their way through a promontory, and wa&s;h away the &s;oil from the in&s;ulated part; if it con&s;i&s;t only of &s;oil, it pre&s;ently di&s;appears.

But if there be any &s;olid &s;tratum of &s;tone within, that &s;tratum, when the &s;oil is wa&s;hed away, becomes a rock. It is covered with &s;ea-weed, the only herbage the ocean produces, which is the &s;port of the waves. Virgil has given us the idea with great &s;trength of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Spumea circum</L>

<P>The pencil could not give the idea &s;o preci&s;e. The pencil gives only <HI>form</HI> and <HI>colour:</HI> Virgil's de&s;cription gives <HI>motion.</HI></P>
<P>Numberle&s;s are the natural ruins of this kind, which the tides of the ocean are con|tinually forming in every part of the globe. But &s;uch a land-rock as this before us, bare and in&s;ulated like the rocks of the &s;hore, is a wonderful appearance. It is contrary to nature's whole proce&s;s in forming rocks, as far as we are acquainted with her works. Her rocks are generally in &s;ome degree &s;imilar to the county, in which they are found. The rock, on which the ca&s;tle and city of Edin|burgh &s;tand, it is true, is of very peculiar con&s;truction: yet it does not there &s;o much &s;urprize us. Nature has been in that &s;pot bu&s;ily employed in making rocks. She has
<PB N="46" REF="51">
rai&s;ed them all round the town in various forms; and if &s;he threw one out of her hands, amid&s;t the variety of her operations, a little uncommonly &s;haped, it is not much to be wondered at. But an immen&s;e rock &s;tarting up on the level banks of the Clyde, and on the edge of a mora&s;s, where there is not only nothing &s;imilar to it, but a face of country highly di&s;&s;imilar, is among tho&s;e productions of which the globe of the earth does not afford frequent in&s;tances.</P>
<P>The form of this grand fortre&s;s, on a near in&s;pection, is very picture&s;que. Such al&s;o is the contra&s;t between the two &s;ummits. The craggy &s;ides of the rock are finely broken; and the buildings upon it, tho not in them|&s;elves beautiful, have at lea&s;t a good effect, and give it con&s;equence.</P>
<P>We were curious to &s;ee the contents of this uncommon fortre&s;s: and entering a gate at the bottom, we a&s;cended through a cleft of the rock. Two hundred and eighty &s;teps, hewn out of the &s;olid &s;tone, landed us upon the fir&s;t &s;tory. From hence we clambered the rock to view the works upon the broader &s;ummit: to the other we never attempted to a&s;cend: the path is frightful.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="52">The &s;quare tower, which we &s;ee at the divi&s;ion between the &s;ummits, was once the re&s;idence of Wallace, who&s;e patriotic actions we have &s;een recorded in &s;o many parts of the country.</P>
<P>The texture of this rock, we were told, is of &s;o impenetrable a nature; as to baffle the effects of gunpowder. Boring has often been attempted: but the keene&s;t in&s;trument of the auger-kind cannot touch it. Buchanan indeed tells us, that <HI>Saxum illud e&s;t praedurum, ut vix ullis ferramentis &s;uperabile; e quo &s;i quid vel vi effringitur, vel ruinis collabitur, &s;ulfu|reum late odorem expirat.</HI> This &s;hews the labour of hewing two hundred and eighty &s;teps out of it.</P>
<P>The upper regions of the rock are profu&s;ely covered with the <HI>lychen geographicus;</HI> which is one of the mo&s;t beautiful of all vegetable incru&s;tations. I doubt not, but the&s;e plants of the lychen kind, tho they do not in ap|pearance ri&s;e above the &s;urface of the &s;tone, have their peculiar &s;oils, barren as we may e&s;teem them, as well as oaks, or elms. One loves a free-&s;tone&mdash;another a purbeck; and the &s;pecies before us, I am per&s;uaded from many &s;ituations in which I have &s;een it,
<PB N="48" REF="53">
flouri&s;hes be&s;t on the harde&s;t rock. So beau|tiful are the incru&s;tations of the geographic &s;pecies, that if I had had time to trifle, I could have amu&s;ed my&s;elf with endeavouring to trace the &s;everal countries of Europe among their various forms. I found a &s;trong re&s;em|blance of the outlines of Great Britain.</P>
<P>In the body of the rock is a re&s;ervoir of water, collected from &s;prings, which affords a &s;ufficient &s;upply for any garri&s;on, which the ca&s;tle can admit.</P>
<P>From the batteries we had many very amu&s;ing views. We had one up the Clyde, towards Gla&s;gow; in which that river, now a grand e&s;tuary, forms two or three ample &s;weeps. Dunglas-ca&s;tle is &s;eated on a neck of land, &s;hooting into it. Beyond the Clyde appears a rich di&s;tant country; adorned with &s;everal &s;eats, among which Lord Semple's is con&s;picuous. The town of Glagow, we were told, might be &s;een in a clear day: but when we were at Dunbarton, the weather was hazy.</P>
<P>From an oppo&s;ite part we looked down the Clyde, where it expands into a va&s;t &s;heet of water, occupying almo&s;t the whole of the di&s;tance. It's opening to the &s;ea is intercepted
<PB N="49" REF="54">
by a double range of mountains, which mark the channel of Loch-loung. Into this lake the Clyde enters nearly at right angles. Between the hither-mountains, you &s;ee the &s;trait, through which it pa&s;&s;es: and under tho&s;e on the left, lie the towns of Grenoc, and Port-Gla&s;gow; both of which are di&s;tinctly &s;een.</P>
<P>Between the&s;e two grand views upon the Clyde, we had a third towards the mountains of Loch-lomond, which appeared clu&s;tering around Ben-lomond, in formidable array. The intervening country is varied by the windings of the Leven.</P>
<P>All the&s;e views would receive additional beauty from the peculiar circum&s;tances of tides, &s;torms, &s;hipping, hazine&s;s, and lights. We &s;hould have wi&s;hed al&s;o to have &s;een the ca&s;tle oppo&s;ed to a &s;etting &s;un. The fractured &s;ides of this noble rock, would have received uncommon beauty from &s;uch a light. But we had not the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing it under this, or any other circum&s;tance of peculiar grandeur. It was an object however, which was able to &s;upport it's dignity, without any adventitious aids.</P>
<P>Sallu&s;t gives us a picture very like Dun|barton ca&s;tle, in the following de&s;cription of
<PB N="50" REF="55">
a Numidian fortre&s;s: <HI>Haud long&egrave; a flumine Mo|lucha, erat inter caeteram planitiem mons &s;axeus, mediocri ca&s;tello, immen&s;um editus, uno peran|gu&s;to aditu relicto: nam omnia natura, velut opere, atque con&s;ulto, praeceps.</HI></P>
<P>Buchanan's de&s;cription of Dunbarton, runs thus: <HI>A confluente Glottae, et Levini fluminum, planicies, circiter mille pa&s;&s;uum, ad proximorum montium radices extenditur. In ip&s;o autem an|gulo, ubi amnes commi&s;centur, rupes biceps at|tollitur. Inter duo cornua, quod in &s;eptemtriones ver&s;um e&s;t latus gradus habet, per obliquam rupem, hominum indu&s;tria, et magno labore exci&s;os, per quos vix &s;ingulis e&s;t aditus.</HI></P>
<P>So exact a &s;imilitude appears between the&s;e two de&s;criptions, that if we only reciprocally change the names of Numidia and Scotland, Molucha and Clyde, either de&s;cription will &s;erve for either &s;cene.</P>
<P>To the&s;e two de&s;criptions I could add a third, which Cae&s;ar gives us of Alicia in Gaul. <HI>Opidum erat in colle &s;ummo, admodum edito loco; ut, ni&s;i ob&s;idione, expugnari non po&s;&s;e videretur: cujus collis radices duo, duabus ex partibus flu|mina &s;ubluebant. Ante opidum planities circiter millia pa&s;&s;uum tria in longitudinem patebat.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="56">Fortre&s;&s;es of this kind are always highly e&s;teemed in the momentous periods of enterprize. Sallu&s;t's fortre&s;s has a great event annexed to it in the time of Marius; and Dunbarton has as remarkable a one in the times of Mary.</P>
<P>It was at that period of di&s;order, when Mary was impri&s;oned in England, and all her kingdom was rent from her, that Dun|barton-ca&s;tle alone acknowledged her domi|nion. But tho &s;ingle in her cau&s;e, it's con&s;equence was &s;uch, that Fleming, the governor, would boa&s;t, <Q>He held the fetters of Scotland.</Q> A trifling accident humbled his pride. Having puni&s;hed the wife of a common &s;oldier in the garri&s;on for theft, the hu&s;band, an uxorious man, per&s;uaded of her innocence, and burning with revenge, de&s;erted to the regent, and promi&s;ed to make him ma&s;ter of the fortre&s;s. The man appeared confident, &s;en&s;ible, and re&s;olute; his &s;tory &s;imple, con&s;i&s;tent, and plau&s;ible. In &s;hort, the military men about the regent, thinking the attempt worth hazarding, provided lad|ders and other nece&s;&s;aries, and began their march from Gla&s;gow on the evening of the la&s;t day of march.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="57">Buchanan indulging the imagination of a poet, tells the &s;tory with many embelli&s;h|ments. A &s;imple narrative tells it be&s;t.</P>
<P>It was about midnight when the troops arrived at the bottom of the rock. The moon was ju&s;t &s;etting, and a mi&s;t from the water, had over&s;pread the upper regions of the ca&s;tle; which the officers con&s;idered as a fortunate circum&s;tance; the men, as a lucky omen.</P>
<P>The attempt was made at a part of the rock, where their guide a&s;&s;ured them they &s;hould find two good landings. Their fir&s;t operation was un&s;ucce&s;sful. A ladder, which had been placed in confu&s;ion, gave way; and tho nobody was hurt, yet they feared an alarm. Li&s;tening a moment; and finding all &s;till, they proceeded again; and placing their ladders with more caution, many of the troops attained the fir&s;t landing. Here the &s;tump of an a&s;h tree, firmly interwoven with the rock, was of great &s;ervice to them. They tied cords around it; and while &s;ome were employed in drawing up their companions to the fir&s;t landing, others made u&s;e of the ladders in &s;caling the &s;econd.</P>
<P>On one of the ladders happened an odd circum&s;tance. A man, in the middle of the
<PB N="53" REF="58">
a&s;cent, was &s;eized with convul&s;ions. To &s;top was dangerous; to throw him down, inhuman. Nece&s;&s;ity quickens invention. They bound him tight to the ladder; and turning it round, a&s;cended over his brea&s;t. The whole party arriving thus by degrees at the &s;econd landing, they found the only ob&s;truc|tion now left, was a wall; which was yet of &s;uch height as to require a third application of the ladders. The day was dawning&mdash;they had not a moment to lo&s;e&mdash;with redoubled di&s;patch they made this la&s;t pu&s;h.</P>
<P>Then fir&s;t three drou&s;y centinels took the alarm: but many of the a&s;&s;ailants being now upon the wall, which was lower within, they leapt down at once, followed by the re&s;t. The centinels were di&s;patched: <Q>God and the King,</Q> was echoed, with loud &s;houts on all &s;ides: the &s;ecurity of the garri&s;on was in&s;tantly changed into confu&s;ion; and the ca&s;tle was taken without &s;triking a blow.</P>
<P>The town of Dunbarton lies about a mile from the rock. It is an incon&s;iderable place; and delayed us only for refre&s;hment. From hence we proceeded to Gla&s;gow.</P>

<P>AS we leave Dunbarton the ca&s;tle-rock in retro&s;pect lo&s;es it's double-top; and takes rather a heavy form.</P>
<P>Dunglas-ca&s;tle is the next object we meet. It appears to &s;tand upon a penin&s;ula, which runs into the Clyde; and, being adorned with a back ground of mountains, makes a good picture.</P>
<P>The road to Gla&s;gow continues, for many miles, along the banks of the Clyde; which is &s;till a grand e&s;tuary, and covered with &s;hipping of various forms. The country is well cultivated; but tho woody, it is not pic|ture&s;que. The Clyde &s;eldom forms a wind|ing bay. It's banks are generally parallel.</P>
<P>Gla&s;gow is a beautiful town; and contains a great number of elegant hou&s;es. If they were a little more connected, the high &s;treet, which is ample in it's dimen&s;ions, would in
<PB N="56" REF="61">
all re&s;pects be noble. The &s;eparation of the hou&s;es, no doubt, hath it's conveniences: but &s;o many breaks injure the per&s;pective. The great church is a va&s;t pile; but we &s;aw nothing very plea&s;ing in it's &s;tructure; and it accords ill with the modern &s;plendor of the city.</P>
<P>Here we were told of a &s;mall Gothic chapel at Pai&s;ley, within a few miles of Gla&s;gow, which is remarkable for a very &s;urpri&s;ing eccho. The flap of a door is converted into a peal of thunder; and a melodious air, lo&s;ing all idea of earthly mu&s;ic, becomes an inchanted &s;train.</P>
<P>From Gla&s;gow to Hamilton, the road is bare of objects. The only one of con&s;equence is Bothwell-ca&s;tle; of which we have a very ordinary view on the right. It appears to &s;tand on a flat; and is di&s;covered only by two or three detached parts, which &s;carce appear above the trees, that &s;urround it: whereas in fact it is &s;eated on an eminence, and overlooks the Clyde. From this &s;ide I have &s;een two or three good drawings of it's ruined towers. Bothwell-ca&s;tle, in the time
<PB N="57" REF="62">
of Edward the fir&s;t, was the re&s;idence of the Engli&s;h governor. It afterwards belonged to a man the mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly marked of any, in the annals of Scotland, for the audacity, and &s;plendour of his crimes.</P>
<P>Hamilton-hou&s;e, which we &s;oon approached, di&s;appointed us, both in pro&s;pect, and on the &s;pot. It had the appearance of one of the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable places we &s;aw in Scot|land&mdash;heavy, awkward, and gloomy. From it's form indeed, nothing beautiful could re|&s;ult. It is a centre, with two very deep wings tacked to it, at right angles. Nor did we &s;ee any thing in the &s;ituation that was plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The awkwardne&s;s of the hou&s;e indeed was an original error, which could not be cor|rected, without rebuilding: but I am in|formed, the park, the approach to the hou&s;e, and the whole &s;cenery around it, are intirely altered, and improved, &s;ince the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions were made. Two winding rivers, the Clyde, and the Avon, flow through the park; of which proper advantage is taken. There is al&s;o much greater variety of ground about it, than could have been &s;uppo&s;ed, before the incum|brances
<PB N="58" REF="63">
were removed. Advantage al&s;o has been taken of &s;ome clumps of very fine old oaks, which grow in the park; and which greatly adorn the banks of the Avon. To the&s;e many new plantations have been added, which are in a very thriving condition. In &s;hort, tho Hamilton does not enjoy that gran|deur of &s;ituation, which we admire at Hope|ton-hou&s;e, and Inverary; yet as a park-&s;cene, I am informed, it is now become &s;uperior in richne&s;s, and picture&s;que beauty, to any thing of the kind in Scotland. The internal part of the hou&s;e too has been greatly improved. The hall particularly, which was a gloomy, and di&s;agreeable entrance; is now, I am told, an elegant room, decorated in a grand, yet &s;imple &s;tyle.</P>
<P>The dukes of Hamilton &s;eem to have been copious collectors of pictures; of which there is great profu&s;ion in every room. In general, one &s;hould not &s;ay much for the ta&s;te, with which the&s;e collections have been made. A few are very good. In the gallery hang two or three excellent portraits by Vandyck, among which the earl of Denbigh is a ma&s;ter-piece. He is dre&s;&s;ed in a red-&s;ilk jacket, and holds a gun in his hand. His hair is &s;hort, and
<PB N="59" REF="64">
grey; and he looks up with a countenance &s;o full of nature, and character, that you are amazed the power of colours can expre&s;s life &s;o &s;trongly. This picture is by &s;ome attributed to Rubens.&mdash;In a clo&s;et hangs a &s;mall female profile by Vandyck, which is equal to any picture I have &s;een, by that plea&s;ing ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>But the glory of Hamilton, is Daniel in the lion's den, by Rubens. It would per|haps be doing more than ju&s;tice to it's merit, to rank it above the mo&s;t capital pictures by this ma&s;ter in England; two or three of tho&s;e e&s;pecially in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the duke of Marlborough; and that celebrated one of Simon's &s;upper, at Houghton-hall <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now &s;ent to Ru&s;&s;ia.</NOTE>: but without entering into any invidious compa|ri&s;on, it is certainly a noble work.</P>
<P>The prophet is repre&s;ented &s;itting naked in the middle of a cave, &s;urrounded by lions. An opening at the top, through which he had been let down, affords light to the pic|ture. In his face appears ineffable expre&s;&s;ion. Often do we hear the parading critic, in a gallery of pictures, di&s;playing the mixed pa&s;|&s;ions
<PB N="60" REF="65">
where they never exi&s;ted. For my&s;elf indeed, I cannot &s;ee how two pa&s;&s;ions can exi&s;t together in the &s;ame face. When one takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the features, the other is excluded.&mdash;But if the mixed pa&s;&s;ions ever did exi&s;t any where, they exi&s;t here. At lea&s;t from the ju&s;tne&s;s of the repre&s;entation, you are &s;o intirely intere&s;ted in the action, that the imagination is apt to run before the eye; and fancy a thou&s;and emotions, both of hope, and fear, which may not really exi&s;t. The former appears the ruling pa&s;&s;ion; but a cold, damp &s;weat hangs evidently on the cheek, the effect of conflict. The whole head in|deed is a matchle&s;s piece of art. Nor is the figure inferior. The hands are cla&s;ped: agony appears in every mu&s;cle, and in the whole contracted form. And indeed &s;o far, I think, we may admit the mixt pa&s;&s;ions: one pa&s;&s;ion may take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the face; and another of the limbs. We may allow, for in&s;tance, a mother to cla&s;p her infant in her arms, with all the tenderne&s;s of love; while her features are marked with terror at the &s;oldier, who &s;trikes it with his &s;word. In the &s;ame way, we may here allow the hands to be cla&s;ped in agony; while hope alone is &s;eated
<PB N="61" REF="66">
in the face. In a word, nothing can be more &s;trongly conceived, more thoroughly under&s;tood, more delightfully coloured, or more delicately touched, than this whole fi|gure. I &s;hould not indeed &s;cruple to call it the noble&s;t &s;pecimen I have ever &s;een, of the art of Rubens. It is all over glowing with beauties, without one defect. At lea&s;t, it had no defect, which I was able to di&s;|cover.</P>
<P>But altho the principal figure (on which I dwell, becau&s;e it is &s;o very capital) exceeded my expectation; yet the whole of the pic|ture, I mu&s;t own, fell beneath it.</P>
<P>The compo&s;ition is good. The lions, of which there are &s;ix, with two lione&s;&s;es, are well di&s;po&s;ed; and &s;tand round the prophet with that indifference, which &s;eems to have ari&s;en from a &s;atiety of food. One is yawn|ing, another &s;tretching, and a third lying down. An arti&s;t of inferior judgment, would have made them baying at the prophet, and witheld by the Almighty from devouring him, as a butcher re&s;trains his dog by a cord. The only fault I ob&s;erved in the compo&s;ition ari&s;es from the &s;hape of the picture. The painter &s;hould have allowed him&s;elf more
<PB N="62" REF="67">
height; which would have removed the open|ing at the top to a greater di&s;tance; and have given a more di&s;mal a&s;pect to the in&s;ide of the den. At pre&s;ent the opening is rather paltry. This has induced &s;ome judges to &s;uppo&s;e, what does not &s;eem improbable, that the picture was not originally painted on one great plan; but that the painter having plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the figure of Daniel, added the appendages afterwards.</P>
<P>But the great deficiency of this picture is in the di&s;tribution of light. No de&s;ign could po&s;&s;ibly be adapted to receive a better effect of it. As the light enters through a con|fined channel at the top, it naturally forms a <HI>ma&s;s</HI> in one part of the cave, which might <HI>gradually fade away.</HI> This is the very idea of <HI>effect.</HI> The &s;hape of the ma&s;s will be formed by the objects that receive it; and if bad, they mu&s;t be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the arti&s;t's judgment. Of all this Rubens was aware; but he has not taken the full advantage, which the circum&s;tances of his de&s;ign allowed. A grand light falls beautifully upon his prin|cipal figure, but it does not graduate &s;uffi|ciently into the di&s;tant parts of the cave. The lions partake of it too much. Whereas,
<PB N="63" REF="68">
had it been more &s;paringly thrown upon them; and only in &s;ome prominent parts, the effect would have been better; and the grandeur, and horror of the &s;cene, more &s;triking. Ter|rible heads &s;tanding out of the canvas, their bodies in ob&s;curity, would have been noble imagery; and have left the imagination room to fancy unpictured horrors. That painter does the mo&s;t, who gives the greate&s;t &s;cope to the imagination; and tho&s;e are the mo&s;t &s;ublime objects, which are &s;een in glimp&s;es, as it were&mdash;mere corru&s;cations&mdash;half view|le&s;s forms&mdash;and terrific tendencies to &s;hape, which mock inve&s;tigation. The mind &s;tartled into attention, &s;ummons all her powers, di|lates her capacity, and from a baffled effort to comprehend what exceeds the limits of her embrace, &s;hrinks back on her&s;elf with a kind of wild a&s;toni&s;hment, and &s;evere delight. Thus Virgil de&s;cribing the Gods, who, in|veloped in &s;moke, and darkne&s;s, beat down the foundations of Troy, gives us in three words, <HI>apparent dirae facies,</HI> more horrid ima|gery, than if he had de&s;cribed Jupiter, Juno, and Pallas, in a laboured detail, with all their cele&s;tial panoply.

<P>IN our way to Drumlanrig, which was the next place we propo&s;ed to vi&s;it, we pa&s;&s;ed over va&s;t wa&s;tes, and barren tracts; the &s;ame kind of country we had met with on our entrance into Scotland. But the beauty of the &s;cene was greatly altered. We had then grand mountains, which, tho void of furniture, formed plea&s;ing lines, and con|tra&s;ts. Here every picture&s;que idea was blotted out: and yet the countries were nearly the &s;ame. A mere accident made all the differ|ence. We &s;aw one in &s;un&s;hine, and the other in rain. A di&s;mal hue was not only thrown over the country; but the eye that &s;urveyed it, was put out of humour; and in a habit, if I may &s;o &s;peak, of taking offence at every thing.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="73">From the ri&s;ing grounds, a little to the right from the road, was pointed out to us Eliock-hou&s;e. We &s;aw it through the rain, or at lea&s;t were made to believe we &s;aw it, &s;eated on an eminence, and bo&s;omed in wood.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tance of this hou&s;e, is, that it was formerly in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Robert Crichton, the father of the cele|brated James Crichton, who is repre&s;ented as one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular characters of his own, or of any other times.</P>
<P>His hi&s;tory is thus told. He was bred at the univer&s;ity of St. Andrew's, where his improvements ran before his in&s;tructors. By the time he had attained his twentieth year, he could &s;peak, and write, correctly, either in pro&s;e, or in ver&s;e, ten different languages. Hebrew and Arabic were two of them. He was perfectly acquainted al&s;o with the whole circle of the &s;ciences, as far as they were then taught.</P>
<P>His accompli&s;hments were equal to his acquirements. Nobody danced &s;o well as Mr. Crichton. Nobody &s;ung &s;o agreeably. He could join the concert with any in&s;trument,
<PB N="69" REF="74">
that happened to be vacant. Exerci&s;es of every kind he performed with &s;uperior excel|lency. In the field he rode with uncommon grace; and he handled arms of every kind with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;kill. So that it was difficult to &s;ay, whether in the active or &s;edentary line, he was the more wonderful man.</P>
<P>Thus furni&s;hed at home, he travelled abroad for farther improvement. He went to Paris&mdash; to Rome&mdash;to Venice&mdash;to Mantua. But in none of the&s;e univer&s;ities he received any ac|qui&s;ition of knowledge. He had already made every thing his own. Admiration at his &s;kill in arts, in &s;ciences, and arms was all he acquired. In the mean time, he was a com|panion for all &s;orts of people. He could be &s;erious, or he could be gay. He could rea&s;on with the philo&s;opher; talk with the man of bu&s;ine&s;s; or trifle with the ladies: and they who were no judges of his parts, and learning, admired the qualities of his heart, the elegance of his manners; and the beauty of his per&s;on. In a word, he acquired in all places the title of the <HI>admirable Crichton,</HI> and under this name he is handed down to po&s;terity.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="75">To &s;ay the truth, a relation of this kind calls for &s;trong vouchers. In the hi&s;tory of mankind, no other &s;uch in&s;tance occurs. The accounts we have of Alcibiades, &s;ir Phil|lip Sydney, and the chevalier Baynard, fol|low far behind. In ver&s;atility of genius, in learning, acquirements, and accompli&s;hments, Crichton far out&s;tripped them all. We &s;hould require &s;trong proof to believe, that the human figure, in any in&s;tance, ever attained the height of eighteen, or twenty feet. We require equal proof to believe &s;o enormous a growth of the human mind. A paper, which Mr. Pen|nant has given us in his Scotch journal, bears the only appearance I know of any anthentic evidence for the wonderful accounts we have of this &s;ingular man. From that paper this &s;light &s;ketch of him is taken. The reader may there &s;ee his life, and actions at large; and the authority on which the account re&s;ts.</P>
<P>The &s;equel of the &s;tory of Crichton, is, that as he was walking, at the time of a carnival, in the &s;treets of Mantua, &s;inging, and playing carele&s;&s;ly on his guitar, he was attacked by &s;ix people in ma&s;ks, and treacherou&s;ly &s;lain, after he had gallantly defended him&s;elf again&s;t them all, and beaten off the attack.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="76">In the dreary regions, in which we now travelled, we met the Clyde wandering about in a very low condition. It is here much nearer it's fountain-head; and carries no pro|gno&s;tics about it of that glory, which it after|wards a&s;&s;umes at Dunbarton.</P>
<P>But tho it cannot produce here that expan&s;e of water, which it di&s;plays on it's approach to the ocean; yet it has water enough to a&s;&s;ume a character of magnificence in another &s;tyle. Near this place it happens to meet with a variety of grand accompaniments&mdash; rocks&mdash;woods&mdash;and hilly grounds; which it turns to great advantage in forming among them many noble falls. But from our not being apprized of this &s;cenery, we were not &s;o fortunate as to &s;ee it: tho it would have carried us very little out of the common road. I had an opportunity however of a&s;king &s;everal que&s;|tions about it; and received very intelligent an&s;wers; from which, and my acquaintance with the &s;ubject in general, I am enabled to give &s;uch an idea of it, as may excite the curio&s;ity of others to profit more from the intelligence, than we were able to do.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="77">The&s;e falls are to be found at a place called Cory-Lin, near Lanerk. From a lofty &s;eat in a gentleman's garden, we were informed, the fir&s;t of them is &s;een to mo&s;t advantage. You look over the tufted tops of trees; and &s;ee the river beyond them precipitating it&s;elf from rock to rock, a con&s;iderable way, rather pouring along (as we under&s;tood) through an abrupt &s;lope, than down a perpendicular de&s;cent. The two cheeks are rugged pre|cipices; adorned with broken rocks. On the edge of one of the&s;e cheeks &s;tands a &s;olitary tower. A path, if you choo&s;e to follow it, leads to the top of the fall; where from a projecting rock (which in high floods is &s;evered from the continent,) you have a tremendous view down the furious cataract, as it pours below the eye. You may carry your curio&s;ity yet farther; and by walking half a mile, may &s;ee the &s;till more celebrated fall of Boniton, and two or three more, I believe, beyond it. In idea, all this &s;cenery is grand, and pic|ture&s;que. The imagination with &s;uch ma|terials may make noble pictures. And indeed I &s;uppo&s;e the whole is in it&s;elf admirable. It is <HI>art</HI> commonly, and not <HI>nature,</HI> that di&s;appoints us.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="78">In our travels through Scotland I have mentioned many &s;cenes, which were ennobled by being called the retreats of Wallace. This was one. Among the&s;e wild rocks, and in the tower, that adorns them, we were told, he lurked, during a period of di&s;tre&s;s. The&s;e traditional anecdotes, whether true, or fabled, add grandeur to a &s;cene: and the variety of the&s;e hiding places, which the Scotts have every where provided for Wallace in his mi&s;|fortunes, &s;hew at lea&s;t their gratitude and affec|tion for one of the noble&s;t heroes, which their own, or any other country hath pro|duced.</P>
<P>The hills, among which we now travelled, are &s;uppo&s;ed to abound with lead; tho many projectors have &s;uffered by &s;eeking it. A celebrated &s;chemer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir George Colebrooke, who made this purcha&s;e of the earl of Selkirk.</NOTE> purcha&s;ed lately a large e&s;tate in this country, at an advanced price, with a view to work it; but his enterprize either mi&s;carried, or was never executed.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="79">It fared better, a few years ago, with an|other projector, at Lead-hill, a little to the right. This gentleman, who&s;e name was Lo|thian, had long &s;ought ore in vain. Many a time in de&s;pair he re&s;olved to de&s;i&s;t: but his workmen rai&s;ed his &s;pirits with fre&s;h hopes. The rock was ju&s;t cut through, which had occa&s;ioned &s;o much delay; or the &s;oil was manife&s;tly marked with the &s;igns of ore; or &s;prings were found, which had the undoubted mineral tinge. Thus deluded by fal&s;e hopes, he went on, till ruin &s;tared him in the face.</P>
<P>At this cri&s;is of his fortunes, a boy, who wrought in the mine, came &s;ecretly to him, and told him, he was deceived by his work|men; and that a vein of ore had been di&s;|covered, and &s;ecreted. Tho the boy was un|acquainted with the depth of the roguery, Lo|thian ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed it. The&s;e knaves were fir&s;t to ruin him, and then to take the works them|&s;elves, at an under-rate.&mdash;The difficulty was, how to profit by the information, without di&s;|covering the informer: for the boy declared with tears, that he &s;hould be murdered, if the thing were known. Lothian bad him fear nothing; and ordered him to &s;aunter about the place, where the vein was di&s;covered, at &s;uch an hour
<PB N="75" REF="80">
the next morning. "At that time, &s;aid he, I &s;hall enter the mine; and &s;eeing you idle, &s;hall pretend to be very angry; when you in a pa&s;&s;ion may throw down your tool as near as po&s;&s;ible to the place, where the vein was found." The &s;cheme was as well executed, as contrived. Lothian finding the boy in a place where he &s;eemed to have no bu&s;ine&s;s, rated him roundly for his idlene&s;s; and re|ceiving an in&s;olent an&s;wer (which, among ill-paid workmen, was not uncommon) &s;truck him two or three times: upon which the boy with great addre&s;s counterfeiting a pa&s;&s;ion, threw his tool out of his hand, and &s;aid, he would work for him no longer. Lothian marked the &s;pot with unob&s;erved attention; and giving him two or three more blows for his in&s;olence, and bidding him go about his bu&s;ine&s;s, went on him&s;elf among the other workmen; a&s;king his u&s;ual &s;tring of que&s;tions, and receiving his u&s;ual &s;tring of an&s;wers. At length, he took up a tool; and begin|ning carele&s;&s;ly to pick about the chambers of the mine, in various places, came by degrees to the &s;pot he had marked, where picking a little about the &s;urface, he &s;eemed &s;urprized; and calling &s;ome of the men, he a&s;ked them,
<PB N="76" REF="81">
if they did not think there were plain indica|tions of ore? The men were of a different opinion, and a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;uch appear|ances were very common; and not in any degree to be tru&s;ted. Lothian however &s;till continued picking about, and told the men, he could not be &s;atisfied, unle&s;s they took their tools, and went a little deeper. With &s;ome reluctance, as being taken from work of more importance, the men complied. But they had not occa&s;ion to go deep. A very few &s;trokes convinced all who were pre&s;ent, not only that there was ore; but that the vein was uncommonly rich. The hone&s;t workmen, joining in the farce, a&s;ked each other with a&s;toni&s;hment, How they could po&s;&s;ibly work &s;o near the place, without di&s;|covering it? In &s;hort, there was a univer&s;al joy, on all &s;ides, on having found at length, what they had &s;o long &s;ought in vain.</P>
<P>The mines here, as in all mineral coun|tries, are de&s;tructive of health. You &s;ee an infirm frame, and &s;qualid looks in mo&s;t of the inhabitants. And yet among the miners of Lead-hill, within the&s;e &s;ix years, a man of the name Taylor, attained the age of one
<PB N="77" REF="82">
hundred and thirty-two years, and as we were informed, with the perfect u&s;e of all his fa|culties. He wrought at his profe&s;&s;ion, as a miner, till he was one hundred and twelve. In the mean time as if, with patriarchal pre|ci&s;ion, he had fore&s;een the extent of his days, he did not marry till he was &s;ixty years of age, and left behind him nine children; whom he lived to &s;ee provided for.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this wild country, night came upon us. But it's &s;hades were unac|companied with any picture&s;que ideas. Often, when mountains, fore&s;ts, and other grand ob|jects, float before the eye, their &s;weeping forms, clad in the &s;hades of evening, have a won|derful effect upon the imagination. But here the objects were neither grand, nor amu&s;ing. All was one general blot.</P>
<P>As we approached Drumlanrig, the country appeared greatly to improve in beauty. The forms of trees &s;wept pa&s;t us; and we were often carried along the &s;ides of dells, and heard the &s;ound of waters, through the &s;tillne&s;s of the night. Such objects beguiled the hours, which began now to verge on midnight.</P>

<P>OUR inn was about a mile from Queen&s;|berry-hou&s;e, which we vi&s;ited early the next morning. It's appearance, as we approach it, is magnificent. It is a turrited &s;quare; &s;eated among woods, and &s;kreened by woody hills.</P>
<P>When we arrived on the &s;pot, it &s;till maintained it's magnificence, tho there is little beauty in the architecture. It was begun immediately after the civil wars of Charles the fir&s;t, and partakes of the un&s;ettled condition of the times. Arts were beginning to flouri&s;h: but the animo&s;ity of chiefs &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; and the laws were yet too feeble to repre&s;s it. The hou&s;e &s;eems therefore to have been formed on a plan neither of civil, nor of military architecture; but between both; tho beauty (&s;uch as it is) &s;eems to have been more attended to, than defence. It
<PB N="80" REF="85">
occupies the four &s;ides of a &s;quare; and it's turrited walls being very lofty, the area within, excluded from &s;un and wind, becomes a mere re&s;ervoir for unwhole&s;ome damps; which it communicates abundantly to the whole hou&s;e. &mdash;The chambers have no magnificence; and we ob&s;erved &s;carce a &s;ingle picture to engage the eye; tho there is a gallery, above an hundred feet long, which is full of pictures.</P>
<P>But if there are few ornaments of this kind, there is no deficiency of other ornaments both within the hou&s;e, and without; among which the <HI>Heart,</HI> the en&s;ign armorial of the hou&s;e of Douglas, appears every where in great profu&s;ion. In England perhaps the hi&s;tory of the <HI>Heart</HI> is little known; but in Scotland every body has heraldry enough to know, that it was given to the Douglas family, in honour of Sir James Douglas, who was employed to carry the heart of Robert Bruce into Pale&s;tine, there to be interred under the altar of the holy chapel at Jeru&s;a|lem. But it is generally imagined, this pre|cious depo&s;it never got there. It was inclo&s;ed in a golden urn; and hung round Sir James's neck, who took &s;hipping, accompanied by two hundred knights. As the ve&s;&s;el was
<PB N="81" REF="86">
&s;ailing near the coa&s;t of Spain, Sir James had intelligence, that king Alphon&s;o was ju&s;t on the eve of a battle with the Moors. The Dougla&s;&s;es always loved fighting; and Sir James could not forego his inclination to this favourite amu&s;ement. He landed therefore with his companions&mdash;went to the royal pavilion, and offered his &s;ervices to the king; which were graciou&s;ly accepted. The battle began; and among all the heroes, that en|gaged, none di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf like the knight with the golden urn. It unfortunately however happened, that as he ventured too far, he was &s;lain, and de&s;poiled of king Ro|bert's heart. But before the battle ended, both it, and the dead body of Douglas were recovered by the bravery of the Spani&s;h troops, and &s;ent back into Scotland. The body was buried in the burying-place of the family near Douglas-ca&s;tle, where Sir James's effigy &s;till remains; and the heart is &s;aid to have been depo&s;ited in the abbey of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lro&s;s.</P>
<P>But if the hou&s;e at Drumlanrig afforded us little amu&s;ement, the &s;ituation of it made amends. It &s;tands on a ri&s;ing ground, on
<PB N="82" REF="87">
the &s;ide of a va&s;t &s;weeping hill, &s;urrounded by mountains, at the di&s;tance of two or three miles. This is one of the grand &s;ituations, which a mountainous country affords; and it is often as beautiful, as it is grand: but it's beauty depends upon the elegant lines, which the &s;urrounding mountains form; upon their rece&s;&s;es; their ornaments; their rugged &s;urface; their variety, and contra&s;t. It depends al&s;o upon the contents of the area within the mountains; it's hills; it's broken grounds; it's woods, rivers, and lakes.&mdash; <HI>Here</HI> the mountain-&s;kreens, in them&s;elves, have no peculiar beauty: but the circular vale, which they inviron, and in which the hou&s;e &s;tands, is &s;o broken, by intervening hills; &s;o adorned with rivers, and varied with wood, that many of it's &s;cenes are beautiful, and the whole greatly diver&s;ified.</P>
<P>A &s;ituation however of this kind, circum|&s;cribed by hills, which keep the eye within bounds, mu&s;t always want one of the greate&s;t beauties of nature&mdash;an <HI>exten&s;ive di&s;tance.</HI> Nor will any &s;pecies of land&s;cape fully compen&s;ate the deficiency. We may have the tinted hill, the middle di&s;tance, and the rough foreground, where the &s;un
<Q><PB N="83" REF="88">
<L>Turns, with the &s;plendor of his precious ray,</L>
<L>The meagre, cloddy earth to glittering gold.</L></Q>
But &s;till we want
<Q><L>&mdash;the charms of laughing vales,</L>
<L>Rocks, &s;treams, and &s;weeping woods, and antique fanes,</L>
<L>Lo&s;t in a wild horizon.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>The more confined land&s;cape would &s;uit very well a man&s;ion le&s;s than &s;uperb: but &s;uch a man&s;ion, as Queen&s;berry-hou&s;e, tho it's &s;ituation is good, would &s;tand yet to more advantage, if it commanded a country.</P>
<P>The garden front of Queen&s;berry-hou&s;e opens on a very delightful piece of &s;cenery. The ground falls from it, near a quarter of a mile, in a &s;teep, &s;loping lawn; which at the bottom is received by a river; and beyond that ri&s;es a lofty, woody bank. All the&s;e objects are in the grande&s;t &s;tyle, except the river; which, tho not large, is by no means incon|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>It is amazing what contrivance has been u&s;ed to deform all this beauty. The de&s;cent from the hou&s;e has a &s;ub&s;tratum of &s;olid rock, which has been cut into three or four terraces; at an immen&s;e expence. The art of bla&s;ting rocks by gunpowder was not in u&s;e, when
<PB N="84" REF="89">
this great work was undertaken. It was all performed by manual labour; and men now alive remember hearing their fathers &s;ay, that a workman, after employing a whole &s;um|mer-day with his pick-ax, could carry off in his apron all the &s;tone he had chipped from the rock.&mdash;How much le&s;s expen&s;ive is it, in general, to <HI>improve</HI> the face of nature, than to <HI>deform</HI> it! In improving we <HI>gently follow:</HI> in deforming, we <HI>violently oppo&s;e.</HI> The duke of Queen&s;berry of that day, who carried on the&s;e works, &s;eems him&s;elf to have been aware of his own folly. He bundled up all the accounts together; and in&s;cribed them, as I have been informed, with a grievous cur&s;e on any of his po&s;terity, who &s;hould ever look into them.</P>
<P>The rough hand employed in the&s;e &s;cenes, having di&s;patched the &s;lope, proceeded next to the river. All it's winding &s;implicity, it's rocky channel, it's woody furniture, and fringed banks, were de&s;troyed at once; and formed, by making a <HI>head,</HI> into an oblong canal.</P>
<P>The grand wooded bank beyond the river &s;till remained an object for improvement. At a great expence a little &s;tream was con|ducted
<PB N="85" REF="90">
from the neighbouring hills to it's &s;ummit. There a mo&s;t magnificent ca&s;cade, con&s;tructed of hewn &s;tone, and con&s;i&s;ting of innumerable &s;teps, received it; and conduct|ed it in &s;tate into the canal.&mdash;So vile a wa&s;te of expence, as this whole &s;cene exhi|bits, we rarely meet with. Deformity is &s;pread &s;o wide through every part of it, that it now exceeds the art of man to re&s;tore it again to nature.

<P>In one of his parks, we were informed, the duke had pre&s;erved a breed of the old Scotti&s;h buffalo, which we were very de&s;irous to &s;ee. Our conductor told us, they might probably be in &s;ome di&s;tant part of the park; and might with difficulty be found. We determined however to go in que&s;t of them. It was high noon; and the day was &s;ul|try: the cattle, it was therefore &s;uppo&s;ed, might be at that time in a valley, which is &s;pread with a large piece of water. Thither we directed our cour&s;e; and beneath the &s;helter of a thick wood we walked at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than a mile we came in &s;ight of the water. The banks of the pool (for it had not the dimen&s;ions of a lake) were adorned with clumps, and &s;ingle trees: and on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, a hanging grove &s;wept down to the water. It was an open grove; and the ground was covered with herbage, as far as the eye could penetrate it's rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="93">This delicious &s;cene the luxurious herd had cho&s;en for their noon-tide retreat; where we di&s;covered them at a di&s;tance, repo&s;ing on the other &s;ide of the water. Our guide informed us they were rather &s;hy; and in|&s;tructed us to walk on without &s;topping, or paying them any particular attention. We had the pool to walk round; &s;o that we had them long in view, before we came near them. As we approached, they ro&s;e and retired gently into the wood; but gave us &s;ufficient opportunity to examine them. There were two bulls, and &s;everal cows, and &s;ome calves. They were milk white, except their no&s;es, ears, and the orbits of their eyes, which were black. Boethius &s;peaks of this breed of cattle, as <HI>boves candidi&s;&s;imos; in form&acirc; leonis jubam habentes; caetera man&s;uetis &s;imillimos:</HI> and Polidore Virgil mentions them nearly in the &s;ame language. <HI>Gignit &s;ylva Calydonia boves candidos, in&s;tar leonum jubatos; qui adeo feri &s;unt, ut domari non po&s;&s;int. Sed quia caro grata palato humano e&s;t, ferunt omne pen&egrave; eorum genus extinctum.</HI></P>
<P>As to their lion-manes, we &s;aw no &s;uch appearance: but indeed we &s;aw them in di&s;|habille, as all cattle are, in their &s;leek, &s;ummer
<PB N="90" REF="94">
attire. In winter, their &s;haggy fur is more picture&s;que; and it is probable their manes may then be luxuriant. We &s;ee a great pro|fu&s;ion of mane often in our dome&s;tic cattle, at that &s;ea&s;on; e&s;pecially when they winter abroad in mountainous countries. I have often ob&s;erved the remains of it even in the month of June. It is po&s;&s;ible al&s;o that the degree of dome&s;tication, in which the&s;e cattle are now placed, may have deprived them gradu|ally of this ornament. But in all other re&s;pects, except the mane, the cattle we &s;aw in the duke of Queen&s;berry's park an&s;wered very exactly to Boethius's de&s;cription of the Scot|ti&s;h buffalo&mdash;that is, <HI>they very much re&s;embled common cattle.</HI> Their form indeed is &s;ome|what more elegant. They have not that bulk of carca&s;s, nor heavine&s;s, which characterizes the common cow. There is a &s;pirited wild|ne&s;s al&s;o in their looks; and when they run, in&s;tead of the clum&s;y cow-gallop, they bound like deer. A herd of them ru&s;hing at once over a lawn, makes the fore&s;t tremble.</P>
<P>One of the bulls (for the other had not yet attained his growth) was a noble animal. He &s;eemed to be a bea&s;t of prodigious &s;trength; but it was an active, rather than a &s;luggi&s;h
<PB N="91" REF="95">
&s;trength. His colour was not &s;o white, as the re&s;t of the group. His &s;houlders and &s;ides had a yellowi&s;h tinge; which we thought became him; till our guide informed us, that it was not his natural hue; but that he had been rubbing him&s;elf upon &s;ome okery ground in the park. This intelligence immediately turned the beauty into a defect. Such is our love for nature, that when we find any thing artificial, which we &s;uppo&s;ed was natural, we are di&s;gu&s;ted; and cannot bring the eye to it again with plea&s;ure. For tho the object in it's artificial di&s;gui&s;e, may be <HI>in it&s;elf</HI> more beautiful; yet we cannot per&s;uade our&s;elves, but that nature <HI>undi&s;gui&s;ed</HI> would be more <HI>uniform,</HI> and of cour&s;e more plea&s;ing. Thus in the object before us, tho the tinted &s;houlders of the bull were beautiful; yet when we knew the tint was artificial, the eye immediately revolted; and we conceived, that if it had been removed, we &s;hould have &s;een &s;till greater beauty&mdash;the beauty at lea&s;t of uniformity. Thus too, tho the cheek of a lady, when &s;kilfully painted, may appear more beautiful, while we are ignorant of the artifice; yet when we are a&s;&s;ured it is painted, we take offence&mdash;either becau&s;e on clo&s;er in&s;pection we
<PB N="92" REF="96">
conceive a cheek &s;o glowing, not perfectly in uni&s;on with the other features, on which time may have made an impre&s;&s;ion; or be|cau&s;e we conceive the bloom to be a di&s;gui&s;e to &s;ome defect, which the prying imagination endeavours to &s;ee through.</P>
<P>The wild cattle we were examining, are as much in a &s;tate of nature, as the boun|daries of an exten&s;ive park will admit. They are at lea&s;t &s;ubject to no controul. Dome&s;tic u&s;e of no kind is made of them; and when killed, they are &s;hot, like wild bea&s;ts, from trees. For if they &s;hould happen only to be wounded, they are dangerous. Otherwi&s;e, they mole&s;t nobody, who does not mole&s;t them: but the cows, if you offer to touch their calves, are fiercer than the bulls.</P>
<P>Naturali&s;ts give a uniform colour to all animals in a &s;tate of nature; and inform us, that dome&s;tication induces variety. In cows we may &s;uppo&s;e therefore the original colour to be white, or a tint &s;o near it as to be called white. Aeneas found white cattle in Italy, and admiral An&s;on, in Tinian. Buffon
<PB N="93" REF="97">
indeed &s;uppo&s;es the yellowi&s;h dun to be the original colour. But whether white, or yel|low be the original colour, it is certain, that white has ever been mo&s;t in e&s;teem. When a bull, or a heifer, was led up to the altar of the Gods, it was generally white: and when de&s;cribed by the poets as peculiarly beautiful, this hue is always given it. The venerable Apis him&s;elf was white.</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, with regard to the <HI>picture&s;que beauty</HI> of white cattle, I &s;hould make a di&s;|tinction. As the <HI>ornament of a &s;cene,</HI> I think no cattle &s;o beautiful. No &s;ight of the kind ever exceeded that of the herd, which gave occa&s;ion to the&s;e remarks. At the &s;ame time, when we con&s;ider the bull as a <HI>&s;ingle object,</HI> a dark colour melting into a lighter, is more picture&s;que: and of all colours, Buffon's yel|lowi&s;h dun, if the head and &s;houlders be dark, is the mo&s;t beautiful.</P>
<P>Among the plea&s;ing &s;cenes of Drumlanrig, one is of &s;o peculiar a nature, that it &s;hould never be forgotten. It con&s;i&s;ts in the un|common appearance of comfort and happi|ne&s;s,
<PB N="94" REF="98">
which reigns every where among the duke's tenants. Contrary to the u&s;ual prac|tice of the Scotch nobility, the duke of Queen&s;|berry <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The duke of Queen&s;berry, here &s;poken of, was the la&s;t duke.</NOTE> grants lea&s;es of his farms; and has built comfortable hou&s;es for his tenants, through his whole e&s;tate. Many of them are ranged within &s;ight of his ca&s;tle, at pro|per di&s;tances along the &s;ides of the hills. If they are not picture&s;que, they have a much higher &s;pecies of beauty; and adorn a coun|try more than the mo&s;t admired monuments of ta&s;te. Mr. Maxwell, the duke's &s;teward, who pre&s;ides over all the&s;e improvements, &s;eems to have the intere&s;t of the lord, and tenant equally at heart. He talks of the munificence of the one, and of the happine&s;s of the other, with the &s;ame plea&s;ure. The Queen&s;berry-e&s;tate, he told us, had in nine years, yielded about &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds; out of which &s;um the duke had only drawn, for his own private u&s;e, as he was at|tached to his &s;eat at Ame&s;bury, about thirty thou&s;and pounds. All the re&s;t was &s;pent in the country, on works of charity, gene|ro&s;ity,

improvement, or of public utility. Among the latter he had lately expended a large &s;um upon a noble road; which winds &s;ome miles down the &s;ide of a mountain, not far from his ca&s;tle. We had rea&s;on to ble&s;s his bounty on this occa&s;ion. We travelled it with great ea&s;e in the night, tho in many parts it is very &s;teep. We &s;aw the old road, the next day, full of cataracts, like the bed of a mountain torrent.</P>
<P>Near Drumlanrig &s;tands Queen&s;berry-hill, which probably took it's name from &s;ome ancient tradition. From this hill the dukes of Queen&s;berry take their title: and from the &s;ides of it ari&s;e tho&s;e &s;prings, which are the principal &s;ources of the river Clyde.</P>
<P>On another hill, in &s;ight of the hou&s;e, remain &s;till the ve&s;tiges of Tieber's ca&s;tle; originally a Roman &s;tation; and long after|wards a fortre&s;s of con&s;iderable &s;trength. In the hi&s;tory of the wars between England and Scotland, it is &s;aid to have been one of Edward's &s;trong holds; and to have been

taken from him by Wallace. We have &s;een &s;everal of that hero's retreats in the times of di&s;tre&s;s: but here he appeared in force; and kept in awe, by the terror of his &s;udden incur&s;ions, the neighbouring chiefs, who were inclined to Edward.</P>
<P>A little to the left of Tieber's ca&s;tle, ari&s;es Entrekin, a hill chiefly famous for a frightful road, pa&s;&s;ing over it, called by way of emi|nence, the <HI>path of Entrekin.</HI></P>

<P>FROM Drumlanrig to Dumfries, the road is rather plea&s;ant, than picture&s;que. The <HI>grand &s;tyle</HI> of land&s;cape is now gone; the blue mountains of the highlands are &s;unk below the horizon; and the country in general is flat, and uniform.</P>
<P>A little before we reach Dumfries, we meet with an object, which detained us &s;ome time&mdash;the ruins of Linclouden-college. It appears to have been formerly a foundation of &s;ome con&s;equence. The habitable part may &s;till be traced; contiguous to which are a chapel, a hall, and other appendages of a college. The remains of the chapel, and hall are of elegant Gothic; and the whole is &s;o combined, as to afford two or three
<PB N="98" REF="104">
good views. The roof of the chapel is vault|ed; and &s;till remains entire.</P>
<P>Linclouden-college was once a hou&s;e of Benedictine nuns; but tho&s;e ladies growing licentious, Archibald the Grim, earl of Dou|glas, disfranchi&s;ed them, and endowed a col|legiate hou&s;e in their room. When the hou&s;e of Douglas was in the plenitude of it's power, the kings of Scotland were little con&s;idered in the&s;e parts. At Douglas-ca&s;tle, conventions were called; troops were rai&s;ed; and every act of regal authority was exerci&s;ed. The earl of Douglas therefore by his own arbitrary power altered the form of this religious hou&s;e. Archibald the Grim conveys to us the idea of a &s;avage de&s;pot. But his character was very different. <HI>Grim</HI> in the Scotch language &s;ignifies <HI>black.</HI> And Archibald was in fact, an upright, religious man with black hair, and eye-brows.&mdash;In Linclouden-college is a rich tomb erected to the memory of Margaret daughter of Robert the third of Scotland, who married the &s;on of Archibald the Grim.</P>
<P>Dumfries &s;tands plea&s;antly upon the Nith. The water, and &s;cenery about the bridge, is amu&s;ing. Upon Corbelly-hill, which is ju&s;t beyond the river, we have a plea&s;ing
<PB N="99" REF="105">
view of it's winding cour&s;e towards Solway-frith.</P>
<P>On the confines of England, and Scotland, the antiquarian ea&s;ily collects ve&s;tiges enough of border-feuds to fill his volume. There is &s;carce a bridge, or a pa&s;s, that has not been gallantly attacked, and defended&mdash;nor a hou&s;e of any antiquity, that has not been plundered, or be&s;ieged. But there is one work, of which con&s;iderable traces remain, of more than ordinary con&s;equence; that great fo&s;&s;e, thrown up formerly at this place, to prevent the incur&s;ions of the Engli&s;h, known at this day by the name of <HI>Warder's dyke.</HI> Here a watch being con&s;tantly placed; &s;ignals were given by beacons on the approach of an enemy; and the whole country was in|&s;tantly alarmed. The alarm-cry was <HI>a Lore|burn, a Loreburn;</HI> which words, tho not now under&s;tood, are in&s;cribed as a motto on the provo&s;t's &s;taff of office; and by a well-imagined device, transfer the idea of vigi|lance, from the &s;oldier to the magi&s;trate.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="106">At Dumfries we breakfa&s;ted with Mr. Goldie; with whom one of our party was well acquainted. Of the recovery of this gentleman from a lethargy, we heard afterwards a very a&s;toni&s;hing account. He was a large corpulent man; and the di&s;order, under which he had long laboured, had at length gained &s;o much upon him, that he would fall a&s;leep at his meals, with a knife, and fork in his hands. His death indeed was almo&s;t daily apprehended. The fatal moment, as it ap|peared, at length arrived. A fit of apoplexy, bereft him of his &s;en&s;es, and of every &s;ymptom of life. A phy&s;ician attended, and for the &s;atisfaction of his friends applied tho&s;e reme|dies, which are con&s;idered commonly as the apparatus only of death. They produced no apparent effect; and his relations, having taken their la&s;t leave of him, retired. Two &s;ervants &s;at by him; one of whom was em|ployed in &s;upporting his dying ma&s;ter's head. The man continued about two hours in the &s;ame po&s;ture: and &s;uppo&s;ing it now a u&s;ele&s;s office, he complained of the fatigue, and told his fellow &s;ervant, he could not well continue it longer. The dying man, almo&s;t in&s;tantly recovering with all his &s;en&s;es about

him, and having heard what his &s;ervant had &s;aid, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from his office; and from that moment not only the effects of his apo|plectic fit, but of his lethargic di&s;order were intirely removed. He &s;upped with his family that evening in perfect health; and was as much a man of bu&s;ine&s;s afterwards as he had ever been in any part of his life before: nor had he ever again the lea&s;t &s;ymptom either of lethargy, or apoplexy. He died about five years after this event, at the age of &s;ixty-eight, of a total decline of &s;trength, with &s;ome drop&s;ical appearances; but with his &s;en&s;es perfectly clear. It was about a quarter of a year before his death, when we breakfa&s;ted with him; and it did not then appear, that he had ever had any ailment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We had this account from Dr. Carlyle of Carli&s;le; and have had it &s;ince been authenticated by Dr. Gilchri&s;t of Dumfries.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As we leave Dumfries, a wide, bleak, unplea&s;ant country opens before us. But as we approach the frith, our views become rather more picture&s;que. There is &s;omething plea&s;ing in tho&s;e long &s;tretches of &s;and, di&s;tant
<PB N="102" REF="109">
country, and water, which flat &s;hores exhibit. The parts are often large, well-tinted, and well-contra&s;ted. Often too their various &s;ur|faces appear ambiguous, and are melted to|gether by light mi&s;ts into one ma&s;s. They are beautiful in that ambiguity; as they are al&s;o, when the vapours vani&s;hing, a gleam of &s;un|&s;hine breaks out; and &s;hoots over them in lengthened gleams. To make pictures of them, in either ca&s;e, the foreground mu&s;t be adorned with objects,&mdash;ma&s;ts of &s;hips, figures, cattle, or other proper appendages, to break the lines of di&s;tance.</P>
<P>A land&s;cape of this kind we had where the Nith joins the Solway. It con&s;i&s;ts of a va&s;t &s;tretch of country rendered dubious by di&s;tance; and broken into ample parts, as it approaches the eye.</P>
<P>We had the &s;ame kind of view al&s;o towards Newbay-ca&s;tle, which belongs to the marqui&s;s of Annandale; and appears from the di&s;tance, where we &s;tood, like the ca&s;tle of de&s;olation, overlooking the barren &s;hores of the frith.</P>
<P>A little to the we&s;t, we were informed, the coa&s;t becomes more beautiful. It is there
<PB N="103" REF="110">
wa&s;hed by the &s;ea: and tho the &s;hores of an e&s;tuary may have their mode of beauty; yet it is always inferior to the bold headlands, the rocky promontories, and winding bays of the ocean.</P>
<P>One &s;cene on this coa&s;t was particularly mentioned to us, as worth vi&s;iting&mdash;the &s;eat of the earl of Selkirk&mdash;on the account of it's &s;ingularity, and beauty. I &s;hall ju&s;t give the outlines of it, as I heard them de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Where the coa&s;t runs almo&s;t directly oppo|&s;ite to the &s;outh, a bay enters it of con&s;iderable circumference. The entrance is narrrow, and occupied by an i&s;land; which forms the whole into a grand lake. The ground, which circles it, is high; but rather hilly, than mountainous. Some parts of it are rocky; other parts lord Selkirk has planted.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the bay, a penin&s;ula, containing only a few acres, runs into it; which is &s;ometimes, (tho rarely,) when the tides are high, formed into an i&s;land. On this penin&s;ula &s;tands lord Selkirk's hou&s;e. It was formerly an abbey; and enjoyed the &s;ame kind of &s;ituation, which the abbey of
<PB N="104" REF="111">
Torbay in Devon&s;hire did. Only the abbey of Torbay &s;tood more within the land. From the abbey, which &s;tood formerly here, this place obtained the name of St. Mary's i&s;le, which it &s;till retains.</P>
<P>Situations of this kind are often very plea&s;ing; but the beauty of them depends chiefly on the grounds, which inviron the water. How the&s;e are &s;haped, I know not: but if their forms be analogous to tho&s;e we chiefly met with along the bays or lochs, of the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Scotland, they cannot be unplea&s;ing. One beauty, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, they mu&s;t enjoy. As the bay opens to the &s;outh, one of it's &s;ides mu&s;t be inlightened by the morn|ing, and the other by the evening &s;un; and the veering of the lights mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occa|&s;ion, if the &s;kreens be well broken, a great variety of beautiful illumination.</P>
<P>On the we&s;tern &s;ide of Saint Mary's i&s;le, a &s;mall creek runs up; and forms the harbour of Kirkudbright. This town, tho of no exten&s;ive trade, employs coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;els enough to people the bay with &s;hipping; which is a great advantage to it in a picture&s;que light.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="112">Of this town the noted refugee, Paul Jones was a native. Having been pro&s;ecuted for &s;ome offence, he fled from home; and being an active &s;eaman, obtained the command of a privateer in the American &s;ervice. As he knew well the parts about his native town, he executed one of his fir&s;t enterprizes at this place. Early one morning he &s;tood into the bay, with colours flying, like a Briti&s;h frigate; and &s;ent his boat on &s;hore, near lord Selkirk's hou&s;e, well-manned with an officer, who had orders to behave as if he commanded a pre&s;s|gang. The &s;cheme took effect. All the men about the hou&s;e, and grounds, imme|diately di&s;appeared. When all was clear, the officer, with his party &s;urrounded the hou&s;e, and inquired for lord Selkirk. He was not at home. Lady Selkirk was then inquired for. The officer behaved very civilly; but told her plainly, that his errand was, to carry off the family-&s;ervice of plate. She a&s;&s;ured him he had been mi&s;informed; and that lord Sel|kirk had no &s;ervice of plate. With great pre&s;ence of mind &s;he then called for the but|ler's inventory, and convinced him on the &s;pot of his mi&s;take. At the &s;ame time &s;he or|dered wine. The officer drank her health
<PB N="106" REF="113">
politely; and laying his hands on what plate he met with, went off without doing any wanton mi&s;chief.&mdash;This paltry piece of de|predation was the fir&s;t thing, that le&s;&s;ened Paul Jones in the e&s;teem of his brother-officers; who afterwards &s;aw more into his character; and felt great reluctance at &s;erving with a fellow, however daring, and enter|prizing, &s;o low, illiberal, and unprincipled.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;cenery about St. Mary's i&s;le, we were told of other parts of the coa&s;t, &s;till more to the we&s;t, which were well worth vi&s;iting. But our time not allowing us to go in que&s;t of them, we continued our rout to England.</P>
<P>As we approach the frith &s;till nearer, it becomes narrower; and the oppo&s;ite &s;hores of England begin now to take a form in the di&s;tance. The principal features are the high woody grounds about Bolne&s;s, and the moun|tains of Cumberland, among which Skiddaw is con&s;picuous.</P>

<P>As we enter England, we have a grand di&s;tance on the right. The nearer parts of it pre&s;ent the river Eden uniting with Sol|way-frith. Beyond the&s;e ri&s;es the city of Carli&s;le, di&s;tingui&s;hed by it's ca&s;tle, and ca|thedral: and beyond all, a range of moun|tains.</P>

<P>ON entering Scotland, what makes the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the picture&s;que eye, are tho&s;e va&s;t tracts of land, which we meet with in|tirely <HI>in a &s;tate of nature.</HI> I &s;peak not here of mountains, or vallies, or any <HI>particular &s;pecies</HI> of country; but of tho&s;e large tracts of <HI>every</HI> &s;pecies, which are totally untouched by art. In many parts of England, in Der|by&s;hire particularly, and the more northern counties, we &s;ee va&s;t di&s;tricts of the&s;e wild &s;cenes: but &s;till they are generally inter&s;ected by the boundaries of property, (con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of loo&s;e &s;tone walls) which run along the wa&s;tes, and &s;ides of mountains; and a&s;|cend often to their &s;ummits. There cannot be a greater deformity in land&s;cape. The&s;e rectilineal figures break the great flowing lines of nature, and injure her features, like tho&s;e
<PB N="112" REF="121">
whim&s;ical &s;cratches, and pricked lines, which we &s;ometimes &s;ee on the faces of Indians.&mdash; But in Scotland, at lea&s;t in tho&s;e parts which we vi&s;ited, we rarely met with any of the&s;e inter&s;ections. All is unbounded. This, it is true, is not &s;o much a beauty, as the re|moval of a deformity; but when deformi|ties are removed, beauty in &s;ome &s;hape, ge|nerally makes it's appearance. It is art that &s;ophi&s;ticates nature. We con&s;ider cloathing as nece&s;&s;ary; and &s;ome modes of it as pic|ture&s;que: but &s;till it hides the forms of nature, which are undoubtedly more beau|tiful: &s;o that beauty gives way to decency, and convenience.&mdash;It is thus in land&s;cape. Ceres, Triptolemus, and all the worthies, who introduced corn and tillage, de&s;erve un|que&s;tionably the thanks of mankind. Far be it from me to di&s;turb their &s;tatues, or era&s;e their in&s;criptions. But we mu&s;t at the &s;ame time acknowledge, that they have mi&s;erably &s;cratched, and injured the face of the globe. Wherever man appears with his tools, defor|mity follows his &s;teps. His &s;pade, and his plough, his hedge, and his furrow; make &s;hocking enchroachments on the &s;implicity, and elegance of land&s;cape. The old acorn-&s;ea&s;on
<PB N="113" REF="122">
was unque&s;tionably the reign of picture&s;que beauty; when nature planted her own woods, and laid out her own lawns;
<Q><L>&mdash;immunis, ra&s;troque intacta, nec ullis</L>
<L>Saucia vomeribus &mdash;</L></Q>
Could we &s;ee her in her native attire, what delightful &s;cenery &s;hould we have! Tho we might, now and then, wi&s;h to remove a redundance (for &s;he is infinitely exuberant in all her operations) yet the noble &s;tyle in which &s;he works, the grandeur of her ideas, and the variety and wildne&s;s of her compo|&s;ition, could not fail to rou&s;e the imagination, and in&s;pire us with infinite delight.</P>
<P>And yet we mu&s;t make a di&s;tinction among countries in the &s;tate of nature. Va&s;t, exten|&s;ive, flat countries, tho covered with wood, like many of the maritime parts of America, cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s much beauty. Seen from the &s;ea, they are mere woody lines: and examined in their internal parts, the eye is every where confined; and can &s;ee only the trees, that circum&s;cribe it. The only countries, which are picture&s;que in a &s;tate of nature, are &s;uch as con&s;i&s;t of variety both of <HI>&s;oil,</HI> and <HI>ground.</HI> You mu&s;t have <HI>variety of &s;oil,</HI> that &s;ome parts may be covered with wood; and others with
<PB N="114" REF="123">
heath, or pa&s;turage. You mu&s;t have variety of <HI>ground,</HI> that you may view the &s;everal parts of the country with advantage. Rivers al&s;o, and lakes both belong to a &s;tate of nature. In this way the face of England is varied; and would certainly on the whole, be more beautiful in a &s;tate of nature, than in a &s;tate of cultivation. Scotland, and Ireland are both countries of this kind. Such al&s;o are Swit|zerland, Italy, many parts of Germany; and I &s;uppo&s;e, in general, mo&s;t of the northern, and ea&s;tern parts of Europe.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;ual ob&s;ervations of travellers we have many plea&s;ing &s;ketches of land&s;cape in a &s;tate of nature, from countries &s;till more remote, and le&s;s known.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Whydah particularly, on the coa&s;t of Guinea, is repre&s;ented as one of the mo&s;t delightful countries in the world. It abounds every where with a great variety of beautiful trees, which grow in groves, and clumps, without any underwood, or even weeds; and the ground is &s;pread in rich pa&s;tures and meadows, winding among them without any &s;eparation, or boundaries, but what are occa&s;ioned by the folding, and in|termixing of the&s;e natural groves.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="124">The &s;ame kind of &s;cenery is de&s;cribed, in admiral An&s;on's voyage, in the i&s;land of Tinian. There the country, we are told, has the air of a magnificent plantation, in which exten&s;ive lawns, and &s;tately woods are artfully combined, and judiciou&s;ly adapted to the declivities of the hills, and the inequalities of the ground; which ri&s;es in gentle &s;lopes from the beach to the middle part of the i&s;land: tho the general cour&s;e of it's a&s;cent is often interrupted by woody vallies, which wind irregularly through the country.</P>
<P>Such exhibitions as the&s;e however are among the choice&s;t of nature's productions. We are not to expect &s;uch &s;cenes every where. And even in the&s;e picture&s;que countries them&s;elves, the eye will often be repelled by deformities: yet almo&s;t every where, we may expect from pure nature &s;omething either of grandeur or beauty to amu&s;e us. Even in countries like this in which we now travelled, where the &s;oil and climate deny the luxuriant growth of wood, there is abundant amu&s;ement:

The coar&s;e&s;t face of nature is a comely face; and tho her features, in the&s;e barren countries, have no great &s;hare of &s;weetne&s;s, and beauty; yet there is always &s;omething wildly graceful, and expre&s;&s;ive in her countenance.</P>

<P>A <HI>Poverty of land&s;cape</HI> from a want of ob|jects, particularly of wood, is another &s;triking characteri&s;tic in the views of Scotland. A country, as we have &s;een under the la&s;t head, may be in a &s;tate of nature, and yet exceedingly rich. The various hues, which woody &s;cenes exhibit; the breaks which they occa&s;ion; and the catches of light, which they receive, are abundant &s;ources of what we call <HI>richne&s;s</HI> in land&s;cape. In populous countries the various kinds of architecture, bridges, aqueducts, towns, towers, and above all the ruins of ca&s;tles, and abbeys, add great rich|ne&s;s to the &s;cenes of nature; and in <HI>remote</HI> di&s;tances, even <HI>cultivation</HI> has it's u&s;e. Corn-fields, fallows, and hedge-rows, melted to|gether with other objects, we have often had
<PB N="118" REF="127">
occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, form one general rich ma&s;s.</P>
<P>Now in all the&s;e &s;ources both of <HI>natural,</HI> and <HI>artificial richne&s;s</HI> we find the Scotch land|&s;cape every where greatly deficient.</P>
<P>In the <HI>foregrounds</HI> indeed this <HI>poverty of land&s;cape</HI> is of little importance. Here the painter mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily take &s;ome liberty in his views of the <HI>riche&s;t</HI> country. It is rarely that he can form his compo&s;ition without it: and in Scotland he has as good a chance, as any where, of meeting with broken knolls, ragged rocks, or pieces of winding road, to give him a general hint for his foreground, which is all that he de&s;ires. But in the &s;everal <HI>removes of country,</HI> the Scotch land&s;cape is not &s;o happy. In <HI>the&s;e</HI> it's poverty chiefly appears. In mo&s;t parts of England the views are rich. Near the capital e&s;pecially objects are &s;cattered in &s;uch profu&s;ion, that unle&s;s the di&s;tance be very remote, they are injurious to land&s;cape by di&s;tracting the eye. But the <HI>Scotch di&s;tance</HI> rarely exhibits any diver&s;ity of objects. It is in general a barren tract of the &s;ame <HI>uniform unbroken hue;</HI> fatiguing the eye for want of variety, and giving the imagina|tion little &s;cope for the amu&s;ement, which it
<PB N="119" REF="128">
often finds amid the ambiguity of remote objects.&mdash;Were it not for this general defi|ciency of objects, particularly of wood, in the Scotch views, I have no doubt but they would rival tho&s;e of Italy. Many a ca&s;tle Gandolfo might we have, &s;eated on an emi|nence, and overlooking an Alban lake, and a rich circumjacent country. The grand outlines are all laid in; a little fini&s;hing is all we want.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on has given us a picture of Scotch land&s;cape, painted, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, by the hand of peevi&s;hne&s;s. It pre&s;ents us with all it's defects; but none of it's beauties.</P>
<P>"The hills, &s;ays he, are almo&s;t totally covered with dark heath; and even that ap|pears checked in it's growth. What is not heath is nakedne&s;s; a little diver&s;ified, now and then by a &s;tream, ru&s;hing down the &s;teep. An eye accu&s;tomed to flowery pa&s;tures, and waving harve&s;ts, is a&s;toni&s;hed, and repelled by this wide extent of hopele&s;s &s;terility. The appearance is that of matter, incapable of form, or u&s;efulne&s;s; di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by nature from her care; di&s;inherited of her favours, and
<PB N="120" REF="129">
left in it's original elemental &s;tate; or quick|ened only with one &s;ullen power of u&s;ele&s;s vegetation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We&s;t. i&s;les, p. 84.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>How much more ju&s;t, and good-natured is the remark of another able writer on this &s;ubject. "We are agreeably &s;truck with the grandeur, and magnificence of nature in her wilde&s;t forms&mdash;with the pro&s;pect of va&s;t, and &s;tupendous mountains; but is there any ne|ce&s;&s;ity for our attending, at the &s;ame time, to the bleakne&s;s, the coldne&s;s, and the bar|renne&s;s, which are univer&s;ally connected with them <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Gregory's comparative view, &amp;c. p. 229.</NOTE>?"</P>
<P>It is true indeed, that an eye, like Dr. John&s;on's, which is accu&s;tomed to &s;ee the beauties of land&s;cape <HI>only</HI> in <HI>flowery pa&s;tures, and waving harve&s;ts,</HI> cannot be attracted by the great, and &s;ublime in nature. It will bring every thing to it's own model; and mea&s;ure the proportions of a giant by the limbs of a dwarf. Dr. John&s;on &s;ays, the Scotch mountain has the appearance of matter <HI>incapable of form, or u&s;efulne&s;s.</HI> As for it's <HI>u&s;efulne&s;s,</HI> it may for any thing he can know,
<PB N="121" REF="130">
have as much u&s;e in the &s;y&s;tem of nature, as <HI>flowery pa&s;tures, and waving harve&s;ts</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Derham's Phy&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">-theology (Book III. chap. 4) in which the great u&s;efulne&s;s of mountains is examined.</NOTE>. And as for it's being <HI>incapable of form,</HI> he can mean only that it cannot be formed into corn-fields, and meadows. It's form as a mountain is unque&s;tionably grand and &s;ublime in the highe&s;t degree. For that poverty in objects, or <HI>&s;implicity,</HI> as it may be called, which no doubt injures the beauty of a Scotch land&s;cape; is certainly at the &s;ame time the <HI>&s;ource of &s;ublimity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Simplicity,</HI> and <HI>variety</HI> are the acknowledged foundations of all picture&s;que effect. Either of them will produce it: but it generally takes it's tone from one<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Since this was written I met the &s;ame remark in Mr. Shen&s;tone's thoughts on gardening. Tho our opinions are not in all points coincident, they are wholly &s;o in this. "Grandeur and beauty, &s;ays he, are &s;o very oppo&s;ite, that you often dimini&s;h the one, as you increa&s;e the other. Variety is mo&s;t akin to the latter; &s;implicity to the former. Suppo&s;e a large hill, varied by art, with large patches of different-coloured clumps, &s;cars of rocks, chalk-quarries, villages or farm-hou&s;es, you will have perhaps a more beautiful &s;cene; but much le&s;s grand, than it was before."</NOTE>. When the land|&s;cape
<PB N="122" REF="131">
approaches nearer <HI>&s;implicity,</HI> it approaches nearer the <HI>&s;ublime;</HI> and when <HI>variety</HI> prevails, it tends more to the <HI>beautiful.</HI> A va&s;t range of mountains, the lines of which are &s;imple; and the &s;urfaces broad, grand, and exten&s;ive, is rather <HI>&s;ublime</HI> than <HI>beautiful.</HI> Add trees upon the foreground, tufted woods creeping up the &s;ides of the hills, a ca&s;tle upon &s;ome knoll, and &s;kiffs upon the lake (if there be one) and tho the land&s;cape will &s;till be <HI>&s;ublime,</HI> yet with the&s;e additions (if they are happily introduced) the <HI>beautiful</HI> will predominate.&mdash;This is exactly the ca&s;e of the Scotch views. The addition of &s;uch furniture would give them <HI>beauty.</HI> At pre&s;ent, unadorned grandeur is their cha|racteri&s;tic; and the production of <HI>&s;ublime ideas,</HI> the effect.</P>
<P>Yet &s;uch views are by no means void of the picture&s;que. Their broken lines and &s;ur|faces mix variety enough with their &s;implicity to make them often noble &s;ubjects of painting; tho as we have ob&s;erved, they are le&s;s ac|commodated to drawing. Indeed the&s;e wild &s;cenes of &s;ublimity, unadorned even by a &s;ingle tree, form in them&s;elves a very <HI>grand &s;pecies of land&s;cape.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="132">It &s;hould not however be inferred, that Scotland is without wood. Dr. John&s;on's remarks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See John&s;on's tour.</NOTE> on this &s;ubject are too acrimonious. It is true we meet with no ancient fore&s;ts; and rarely with a &s;ingle oak, elm, or beech, of dignity enough to adorn a foreground. In|deed we rarely, except around the &s;eats of the nobility, find any extent of deciduous woods, tho of inferior growth. That beautiful &s;pecies of land&s;cape, which is &s;o common in England, under the denomination of park-&s;cenery, is little known in Scotland. But we met with many a plantation of pine, many a
<Q>&mdash;plaga pinea montis;</Q>
mountains covered with fir, which when fully grown, and their uniformity a little de&s;troyed by the axe, may hereafter have a fine effect. At pre&s;ent we &s;aw few exten&s;ive plantations, that had attained any &s;tate of picture&s;que perfection. In &s;maller plots, we found &s;everal that had. But till lately, I believe the Scotch nobility and gentry have not employed them|&s;elves much in planting.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="133">The Scotch fir, which generally makes a di&s;tingui&s;hed part of the&s;e plantations, is na|turally a beautiful tree. A &s;trait, regular &s;tem is not the form which nature gives it. Left to it&s;elf, it's bole often takes an elegant turn, and it's branches, an irregular form. It's growth is not very unlike that of the &s;tone pine, which is among the mo&s;t picture&s;que trees. It graces the views of Italy; and is one of the greate&s;t ornaments of the ruins of Rome. In England we &s;carce know it. But when the Scotch fir is left to it's natural growth, it frequently re&s;embles this &s;pecies of pine. As it attains age, it's head forms a bu&s;hy clump: and yet I know not, whe|ther it is &s;o happy in this re&s;pect in it's native country; as when it is favoured in England with a richer &s;oil, and happier cli|mate.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Scotch fir, the &s;pruce &s;eems al&s;o a native of this country: at lea&s;t it flou|ri&s;hes here very happily. This tree has more than any other, what, in the language of poetry, hath been called <HI>the &s;hadowy pomp of floating foliage;</HI> and in many &s;ituations nothing combines better with other trees. It is often al&s;o, as a &s;ingle tree, an object of great beauty;
<PB N="125" REF="134">
&s;piring in a pyramidal form; and yet vary|ing it's lateral branches, &s;o as to remove every unplea&s;ant idea of uniformity: and when it receives the &s;un, it's little broken parts, &s;plen|did with light, and hanging again&s;t the dark rece&s;&s;es in the body of the tree, have a fine effect. I am at pre&s;ent however con&s;idering the&s;e trees not as <HI>individuals;</HI> but as they may in &s;ome places, by adorning barren parts, aid that poverty of land&s;cape, which is in general &s;o prevalent in Scotland.</P>
<P>In the&s;e &s;ervices tho we meet the <HI>pine-race</HI> &s;eldomer than we wi&s;h, we find the <HI>deciduous</HI> tree &s;till a greater &s;tranger in the country. Here, and there we &s;ee the larch, and the birch; both of which flouri&s;h; and both of which are picture&s;que. But tho the nobler trees, as we ob&s;erved, occur rarely; yet when we &s;ee them thrive in many parts, particu|larly about Dunkeld, Inverary, Taymouth, Hamilton, and Hopeton-hou&s;e, we cannot but &s;uppo&s;e the country is in general as well adapted to fo&s;ter them, as the pine; and that the nakedne&s;s of Scotland in this re&s;pect, is more owing to the inattention of the lords of the &s;oil, than to any
<PB N="126" REF="135">
thing forbidding either in the &s;oil it&s;elf; or in the climate.</P>
<P>After all, however, I know not whether the pine-race are not, in a <HI>picture&s;que light,</HI> more adapted to the <HI>ruggedne&s;s</HI> of the coun|try, than the deciduous tree; which is more &s;uited to the <HI>&s;ylvan</HI> &s;cene.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, in Scotland winter reigns three parts of the year. The oak protrudes it's foliage late; and is early di&s;robed. The pine is certainly a more cheerful; and a more &s;hel|tering winter-plant; and of cour&s;e not only better adapted to the <HI>&s;cene,</HI> but to the <HI>climate</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>Of pines, no doubt, very large plantations might every where be extended. Many of the &s;ummits of mountains are indeed intrac|table; and mu&s;t be left in their native, un|adorned grandeur: but along the whole di&s;|trict, through which we travelled, as far as we could judge from particular &s;pots, and yet the&s;e not particularly favoured, a very large proportion of the country might bear wood; and Scotland might again be, what we have rea&s;on to believe it once was, full of fore&s;ts, and woody &s;cenes.</P>

<P>WOOD however if it exi&s;ted, could never be the glory of Scotch land|&s;cape. It's mountains, lakes, and rivers are it's pride.</P>
<P>It's mountains are &s;o various, that they appear in every &s;hape, which a mountain can a&s;&s;ume; at lea&s;t in every picture&s;que &s;hape: for (what is very extraordinary among &s;o large a collection of mountains) we meet with very few grote&s;que, or unplea&s;ing forms. A gene|ral elegance runs through their lines, and inter&s;ections; and we found among them what we do not commonly find, not only grand objects; but agreeable compo&s;ition: &s;o true is the poet's remark, that in the wild &s;cenes of Nature there is &s;ometimes
<Q><PB N="128" REF="137">
<L>&mdash;an art,</L>
<L>Or &s;eeming art, which, by po&s;ition apt,</L>
<L>Arranges &s;hapes unequal, &s;o to &s;ave</L>
<L>That corre&s;pondent poize, which unpre&s;erved</L>
<L>Would mock our gaze with airy vacancy.</L></Q>
A mountain is of u&s;e &s;ometimes to clo&s;e a di&s;tance by an elegant, varied line: and &s;ome|times to come in as a &s;econd ground, hanging over a lake, or forming a &s;kreen to the nearer objects. To each purpo&s;e the Scotch mountains are well adapted. The di&s;tances of this country, with all their uniformity, have at lea&s;t one prai&s;e, as we have often had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that of being bound|ed by a grand chain of blue mountains: and when the&s;e mountains approach, their &s;hapes are generally &s;uch as may with little alteration be transferred to canvas.</P>
<P>I have however heard good judges in land|&s;cape find much fault with the Scotch moun|tains in general; and place them on the wrong &s;ide of a compari&s;on with the mountains of Italy, and other countries. I can only there|fore give my own opinion mode&s;tly on this head; &s;ugge&s;ting, at the &s;ame time, that perhaps the&s;e travellers and I may have drawn our conclu&s;ions from different parts of the country. Tho&s;e mountains, which I have remarked, I
<PB N="129" REF="138">
have generally &s;pecified in the cour&s;e of my journey&mdash;Or, it may be perhaps, that the&s;e travellers admire mountains with &s;piry tops, in&s;tead of flowing lines; which with me are not among objects of picture&s;que beauty.</P>
<P>The lakes of Scotland are as various, as it's mountains: but they partake with them of the barrenne&s;s of the country. In the neighbourhood of water one &s;hould expect &s;omething more of vegetation. In gene|ral, however the Scotch lakes are very lit|tle adorned. You &s;ee fine &s;weeping lines, bays, rece&s;&s;es, i&s;lands, ca&s;tles, and mountain-&s;kreens; all of which, except the ca&s;tles, are in the be&s;t &s;tyle. But with the&s;e embelli&s;h|ments you mu&s;t be content: wood you &s;el|dom find; at lea&s;t in any degree of richne&s;s, or proportion.&mdash;At the &s;ame time if you wi&s;h to <HI>&s;tudy land&s;cape,</HI> perhaps you can no where &s;tudy it with more advantage. For &s;cenes like the&s;e, are the &s;chools in which <HI>the elements</HI> of land&s;cape are taught&mdash;tho&s;e great outlines, without under&s;tanding which, the art of fini&s;hing is frippery.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="139">One thing farther may be ob&s;erved with regard to the lakes of Scotland; and that is their dingy colour. The lakes of Cumber|land and We&s;tmoreland have a remarkable pellucidity. They are &s;o tran&s;parent as to admit the &s;ight many fathoms below the &s;ur|face: whereas all the Scotch lakes, which we &s;aw, take a mo&s;&s;y tinge from the moors probably in their neighbourhood: at lea&s;t they were all, I think, of that hue, when we &s;aw them. And yet I know not whether this tinge is of any great di&s;advantage to them. It certainly affects the <HI>general land&s;cape</HI> very little. In navigating the lake indeed; or in viewing it's &s;urface from the bank, it pre|&s;ents an unplea&s;ant hue: and perhaps the reflections are not &s;o vivid, as when the mir|ror is brighter. Yet I have &s;ometimes thought this dingine&s;s is perhaps more in harmony with the moori&s;h lands, which generally form the Scotch land&s;cape, than if the hue of the water had been more re&s;plendent.</P>
<P>The rivers in Scotland are in general very beautiful. They are all mountain-&s;treams; and their channels, as we have &s;een in the cour&s;e
<PB N="131" REF="140">
of this journey, commonly fretted in rock. Their de&s;cent of cour&s;e is rapid, and bro|ken. They are true cla&s;&s;ical rivers:
<Q><L>&mdash; Decur&s;u rapido de montibus altis</L>
<L>Dant &s;onitum &s;pumo&s;i &mdash;</L></Q>
Their banks, we allow, are &s;eldom wooded, of|ten indeed without the lea&s;t fringe: but when they are fortunate enough to find accompani|ments of this kind, as they &s;ometimes do, they form &s;cenes, which perhaps no other coun|try can boa&s;t. Among their beauties are their frequent ca&s;cades; which are generally of the broken kind. Sheets of water we rarely found. Their common properties are admirably de&s;cribed in the following lines of a Scotch bard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burn's poems, p. 170.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><PB N="132" REF="141">The e&s;tuaries of the Scotch rivers exceed any, that are to be &s;een in England. In England, their &s;hores are generally low, and tame: even the Welch mountains give little grandeur to the Severn. But in Scotland, the friths of the Clyde, and Forth, Loch-Fyn, Loch-Loung, and many others, di&s;play the noble&s;t, and mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenery. The Engli&s;h e&s;tuary, be&s;ides the flatne&s;s of it's &s;hores, is often too wide. The water gets out of proportion; which it always does, if it extend more than a mile, or a mile and a half in breadth. The Severn, and the Hum|ber are both of this kind. Nor is the Sol|way-frith much better: it partakes too much of the tamene&s;s and di&s;proportion of the Eng|li&s;h e&s;tuary. But the Scotch e&s;tuaries having their boundaries generally marked by the firmer barriers of mountains, are kept within narrower limits, and rarely exceed a proper width; unle&s;s ju&s;t at their mouths, and even then the height of the mountains is generally &s;uch, as to pre&s;erve a tolerable proportion between the land, and the water.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="142">One circum&s;tance farther may be mentioned, and that is the gloomy, melancholy air, which commonly over&s;preads the Scotch land&s;cape; I mean the highland part of it, which I have been de&s;cribing. "The highlands of Scot|land, &s;ays Dr. Beattie, form a picture&s;que, but in general a melancholy country. Long tracts of mountainous de&s;ert, covered with dark heath, and often ob&s;cured by mi&s;ty weather; narrow vallies, thinly inhabited, and bounded by precipices re&s;ounding with the fall of tor|rents; the mournful da&s;hing of waves along the friths, and lakes, that inter&s;ect the coun|try; and the portentous noi&s;es, which every change of the wind, and every increa&s;e, and diminution of the waters is apt to rai&s;e in a lonely region full of rocks, caverns, and echoes," are all circum&s;tances of a melancholy ca&s;t; and tho they are not entirely of the picture&s;que kind; yet they are nearly allied to it; and give a tinge to the imagination of every traveller, who examines the&s;e &s;cenes of &s;olitude and grandeur.</P>

<P>AMONG the picture&s;que appendages of this wild country, we may con&s;ider the flocks, and herds, which frequent them. Here we have &s;tronger ideas, than any other part of the i&s;land pre&s;ents, of that primeval &s;tate, when man and bea&s;t were joint tenants of the plain.

<P>The&s;e <HI>groups of cattle</HI> were picture&s;que, wherever we found them; tho we found them le&s;s frequently, than we could have expected in a country, which is totally pa&s;turage: for, altho the di&s;trict be wide, the herbage is &s;canty. The animals therefore unable to feed
<PB N="136" REF="144">
every where gregariou&s;ly, as nature inclines them; are obliged to ramble apart, and pick up a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, where they can.</P>
<P>The cattle them&s;elves, as <HI>individuals,</HI> are in general homely. Their colour is commonly black, with patches of white; which make together the mo&s;t inharmonious of all mix|tures. They are &s;mall: their countenances u&s;ually &s;our; and their horns wide&mdash;very un|like the &s;mall, curled, beautiful horn of the Alderney, and French cow. But the&s;e de|formities are of little con&s;equence in <HI>a group.</HI> &mdash;The &s;heep are al&s;o diminutive and ordinary; but in their tattered rough attire, exceedingly picture&s;que.&mdash;The&s;e &s;cenes too are often en|livened by a &s;pecies of little, wild hor&s;es; which tho not ab&s;olutely in a &s;tate of nature, are perfectly <HI>&s;ui juris,</HI> for the fir&s;t three or four years of their lives. Some of the&s;e how|ever are very beautiful.</P>
<P>Nor are the cattle of this wild country more picture&s;que, than it's human inhabitants. The highland dre&s;s (which, notwith&s;tanding

But it is by no means univer&s;ally adopted. The herd&s;man of the mountains finds it, beyond all others convenient: but the farmer, who has a &s;ettled abode, begins to think the Engli&s;h dre&s;s more commodious.</NOTE>) is greatly more ornamental than the Engli&s;h. I &s;peak of it's form; not it's colour; which is checked, of different hues, and has a di&s;agreeable appearance. The plaid con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;imple piece of cloth, three yards in length, and half that mea&s;ure in breadth. A common one &s;ells for about ten &s;hillings. The highlander wears it in two forms. In fine weather he throws it loo&s;ely round him; and the greater part of it hangs over his &s;houlder. In rain he wraps the whole clo&s;e to his body. In both forms it makes elegant drapery; and when he is armed with his pi&s;tols, and Ferrara<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Andrew Ferrara, a Spaniard, was invited into Scotland by James the third to teach his countrymen the art of tempering &s;teel.

<PB N="138" REF="146">
it from one form to the other. Trifling as the operation &s;eems, it would puzzle any man, who had not been long u&s;ed to it.&mdash; But to &s;ee the plaid in perfection, you mu&s;t &s;ee the highland gentleman on hor&s;e-back. Such a figure carries you into Roman times; and pre&s;ents you with the idea of Marcus Aurelius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the antique.</NOTE>. If the bonnet were laid a&s;ide (for the elegance of which but little can be &s;aid) the drapery is very nearly Roman. The bonnet is commonly made in the form of a beef-eater's cap, which is very ugly. I have &s;ometimes however &s;een the bonnet &s;it &s;nugger to the head, and adorned with a plume of feathers. It is then extremely picture&s;que. &mdash;When the common people take a journey on hor&s;e-back, they often gather up the plaid in a few plaits; and &s;o form it into a cloak. In this &s;hape it is &s;canty, and unpicture&s;que.</P>

<P>IN point of all improvements in land&s;cape, and every exertion of ta&s;te, the Scotch are very far behind their more &s;outhern neigh|bours. Few ideas of this kind of beauty have yet &s;eized them. The lawn, the clump, and the winding walk, which carries you &s;imply to every thing worth &s;eeing in the neighbourhood, are rarely found. The mo|dern river indeed I &s;hould not recommed to their imitation. It is generally a poor unnatural contrivance. One genuine Scotch torrent is fairly worth all the &s;erpentine rivers in Eng|land.&mdash;It is true, the Scotch land&s;cape boa&s;ts of nobler effects than the&s;e trivial &s;ervices of art can produce: but even the grand &s;cenery of nature may &s;ometimes be improved by the addition of a good foreground: and about the hou&s;es of the nobility, where improvement is
<PB N="142" REF="149">
avowedly aimed at, the efforts are generally either feeble, ab&s;urd, puerile, or grote&s;que. But a national ta&s;te is long in forming. At the beginning of Henry the &s;econd Gothic architecture fir&s;t appeared, but it did not arrive at perfection, till about the reign of Henry the &s;ixth, which was nearly three centuries afterwards.&mdash;Thus too the Grecian, and Roman architecture, which began to appear in Eng|land in the days of Henry the eighth, was long a heterogeneous compound; and has not yet perhaps attained it's perfect growth.</P>
<P>About the beginning of this century appeared fir&s;t the dawning of the pre&s;ent ta&s;te in im|proving gardens, and plea&s;ure grounds; which is in fact nothing more than a &s;imple endeavour to improve nature by her&s;elf; to collect ideas of the mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenery; and to adapt them to different &s;ituations; pre&s;erving at the &s;ame time the natural character of each &s;cene. But this ta&s;te, &s;imple, ea&s;y, and natural as it appears, is yet by no means become general even in England. The old idea that <HI>art mu&s;t do &s;omething more than nature,</HI> is not yet obliterated; and we &s;ee the grote&s;que, the
<PB N="143" REF="150">
formal, and the fanta&s;tic &s;till holding po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion in many &s;cenes, where we might have expected &s;implicity, and nature. But the Scotch are &s;till at lea&s;t half a century behind the Engli&s;h. In Scotland we &s;aw nothing in this way purely elegant. Even in their be&s;t improvements there is a mixture of the old in&s;ipidity. It mu&s;t be under&s;tood however that I &s;peak of things, as I found them a dozen years ago. Many improvements may by this time be introduced. I have already mentioned the improvements, which I am informed, have been made around Hamilton-hou&s;e; and it is probable there may be many other. It will be long however before this ta&s;te can become general.</P>
<P>With regard to architecture, painting, and &s;tatuary, very little is found in Scotland to detain a traveller, The duke of Athol's gar|dens are at this day <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1776.</NOTE> adorned with tawdry, painted, leaden figures, the product of Hide-park corner.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="151">Before I conclude the&s;e remarks, it may be nece&s;&s;ary, in ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, to &s;ugge&s;t one con&s;ideration. It is very po&s;&s;ible that many, who may travel this country, may &s;ee among the natural objects of it many which have e&s;caped my eye; and lo&s;e others, which mine ob&s;erved. Objects too, may appear under very different forms to different per|&s;ons. All this will nece&s;&s;arily happen from the different circum&s;tances, under which they are &s;een. A grand light, or &s;hade, thrown upon an object, gives it a con&s;equence, with|out which it may e&s;cape notice. One traveller &s;eeing an offskip under the circum&s;tance of a light, thin, mi&s;t, without attending to the cau&s;e, cries out, What a beautiful di&s;tance! Another travelling the &s;ame road, an hour afterwards, finds the di&s;tance gone; and in it's room an unplea&s;ant, black heath. At one time a di&s;tance might appear melting into the horizon; at another a lurid cloud might have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ky above it, and the di&s;tance a&s;&s;uming it's indigo tinge, might be marked with a har&s;h, blue edge.

appeared from the &s;hores of Loch-lo|mond, like a va&s;t tent, with one of the front-curtains drawn back. To another per&s;on travelling in a morning, it would probably make an appearance totally different. I have touched on this &s;ubject in another work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the preface to the North. tour, p. 7.</NOTE>; and may add, that in a mountainous coun|try the&s;e variations are more common than any where el&s;e.

<P>Amid&s;t all the&s;e &s;ources of uncertainty (which by the way are &s;ources al&s;o of variety, and beauty) I have generally marked the time of the day together with &s;uch circum&s;tances, as appeared &s;ingular in the view; and I hope whoever &s;hould &s;ee the country, which I have de&s;cribed, under the &s;ame circum&s;tances, in which it appeared to me, would find the de|lineation of it tolerably exact.</P>

<P>FROM Carli&s;le to Cockermouth, we pa&s;&s;ed over dreary, unplea&s;ant heaths. Some &s;cenery we found; particularly at Cockbridge; and about Whitehall, an old de&s;erted man&s;ion, belonging to the Salkelds. The road to it happens to be &s;o conducted, as to form a good approach.</P>
<P>As we mounted the hill, a little beyond Bowl, we had a grand view of the opening of the Solway-frith, into the Iri&s;h-&s;ea. It's breadth is con&s;iderable, and yet the mountain of Scrofell, which takes it's &s;tation near the mouth of the frith, on the Scotch &s;ide, makes a very re&s;pectable appearance. To the right, we &s;ee the frith narrowing through the &s;pace of many leagues: beyond which the mountains

of Scotland ri&s;e in the di&s;tance; while the Engli&s;h border forms the nearer ground. The whole together is too exten&s;ive for the pencil: but a good view might be taken of the &s;ituation of Scrofell, a Scotch mountain at the mouth of the frith.&mdash;This was our la&s;t re|tro&s;pect of a country which had afforded us &s;o much plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>As we approached Cockermouth, the moun|tains, which occupy the middle of Cumber|land, begin to make a formidable appearance. One of them in particular, enlightened by an evening &s;un, &s;eemed &s;upported by va&s;t buttre&s;&s;es, like &s;ome mighty rampart, in the times of the giant wars. Each buttre&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;e, might be three or four times the height of St. Paul's church. When nature in any of her frolic-&s;cenes takes the &s;emblance of art, how paltry in the compari&s;on appear the labours of men! At the &s;ame time, in her frolic-&s;cenes &s;he is the lea&s;t picture&s;que.</P>
<P>Cockermouth is one of the plea&s;ante&s;t towns in the north of England. It lies in a &s;inuous,
<PB N="149" REF="155">
extended vale; &s;kreened by that circular chain of mountains, Skiddaw, and it's compeers, which we have ju&s;t mentioned. But they do not hang over the vale: they are removed to a proper di&s;tance; and form a grand back|ground to all the objects of it. The vale it&s;elf is beautiful; con&s;i&s;ting of great variety of ground, and more adorned with wood, than the &s;cenes of the north commonly are. But it's greate&s;t ornaments are two rivers, and the ruins of a ca&s;tle. The rivers are the Derwent, and the Cocker; both rapid &s;treams. The former is the larger; to which the latter is but tributary. At the confluence of the&s;e rivers, clo&s;e by the town, ri&s;es a penin&s;ular knoll, in part probably artificial. Upon this &s;tand the ruins of the ca&s;tle; which are among the mo&s;t magnificent in England. Be&s;ides the grand appearance they make on the &s;pot, they pre&s;ent an object in various parts of the vale, and dignify &s;ome very pic|ture&s;que &s;cenes.</P>
<P>Few ca&s;tles have made &s;uch ample provi&s;ion for pri&s;oners of war, as this. Here are two vaulted dungeons, each of them capable of holding fifty men. An aperture at the top of each is ju&s;t &s;ufficient to lower down the un|happy
<PB N="150" REF="156">
captive into it; and his food was &s;hovelled through a &s;mall &s;lit at the &s;ide.</P>
<P>It makes one &s;hudder to think of the wretched condition of a human creature, &s;hut up in the&s;e chambers of horror. How dread|ful would it be for the people of the&s;e more poli&s;hed times to be carried back into tho&s;e barbarous periods, when the&s;e &s;avage practices exi&s;ted. And yet there is &s;uch a corre&s;pond|ence throughout the whole &s;y&s;tem of manners in each aera, that people are happier perhaps under the intire habits of any one age, than they would be under a partial change, even tho that change were for the better. If we could ill bear a mixture with &s;uch &s;avage contemporaries; they would perhaps be as much di&s;compo&s;ed with our poli&s;hed manners. Nor did they feel as we &s;hould, a compa&s;&s;ion for that barbarous treatment, which they were ready to &s;uffer them&s;elves from the chance of war.</P>
<P>The territory annexed to this ca&s;tle by Wil|liam the Conqueror, was all that tract of country called Copeland, at that time a mere fore&s;t, &s;tretching between the river Dudden, and the Derwent. Tradition fixes the origi|nal &s;eat of this little feudal empire at Pap-ca&s;tle,
<PB N="151" REF="157">
about a mile from Cockermouth; and informs us that Waldoff, in the age &s;ucceed|ing the conque&s;t, de&s;erted it, as not &s;ufficiently exten&s;ive, and built the ca&s;tle of Cockermouth. At Pap-ca&s;tle no ve&s;tiges remain of any &s;uch fortre&s;s; but the name and &s;ite, are both &s;trong arguments for it's having exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>We &s;carce remember, in our whole tour, a plea&s;anter walk, than we had one evening in the meadows along the banks of the Der|went. The whole &s;cenery is plea&s;ant, and as we returned by the higher grounds, we had through the whole walk, a varying view of the ca&s;tle of Cockermouth; which tho not the mo&s;t beautiful object, has at lea&s;t a grandeur, and dignity, which make it inter|e&s;ting in every view.</P>
<P>From Cockermouth to Ke&s;wick, (which was our next &s;tage) lead two roads. One of them, over the mountain of Whinlater, is called the <HI>upper road:</HI> the <HI>lower</HI> pa&s;&s;es by Armithwaite-bridge, and the lake of Ba&s;&s;en|thwait. Let the traveller enquire for the latter; and not be deterred, tho the prudent innkeeper inform him, that the Whinlater-road
<PB N="152" REF="158">
is both better, and nearer. He will find the <HI>lower road</HI> very good; and in&s;tead of repining at being carried two miles about, he will wi&s;h he had been carried twenty; (at lea&s;t if he is bent on no errand of importance) &s;o amply will the inconvenience be repayed by a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of &s;cenery, in which grandeur and beauty combine to entertain him.</P>
<P>He will fir&s;t be pre&s;ented with a mountain-vi&s;ta; which he mu&s;t con&s;ider as the grand portal to the &s;cene he approaches. This vi&s;ta, which he pur&s;ues about four miles, is termi|nated by the mountain of Skiddaw.</P>
<P>The &s;urface of this mountain, when we &s;aw it, exemplified very &s;trongly an incident, to which the&s;e va&s;t bodies are &s;ometimes liable; that of <HI>fal&s;e &s;hadows.</HI> Scarce any thing gives higher offence to the picture&s;que eye.&mdash;Whoever pretends to any &s;kill in painting, tho he may not be ver&s;ed in all the theory of light, yet cannot be ignorant of the&s;e general principles&mdash;that the light falls on all the objects of a land&s;cape in one direc|tion&mdash;that all the &s;hadows are of cour&s;e thrown on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide&mdash;and that extended &s;hadow
<PB N="153" REF="159">
is one great &s;ource of that <HI>breadth,</HI> as the painters call it, both in nature, and in paint|ing, in which &s;implicity con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>Now on the va&s;t &s;urfaces of the&s;e elevated bodies it &s;ometimes happens, that in the room of this &s;imple illumination, we &s;ee what I have expre&s;&s;ed by the term <HI>fal&s;e &s;hadows;</HI> which are occa&s;ioned by &s;mall floating clouds inter|cepting the light, and throwing their &s;hadows promi&s;cuou&s;ly; and often where we &s;hould naturally expect light. In <HI>flat</HI> countries the&s;e <HI>fal&s;e &s;hadows</HI> are rarely di&s;gu&s;ting. They are often lo&s;t in cavities: they are often broken and di&s;per&s;ed by intervening objects: they are often lengthened by per&s;pective, and &s;o lo&s;e their di&s;|agreeable form: they are often al&s;o the &s;ource of great beauty, by leaving catching lights upon the di&s;tant parts of a land&s;cape, or &s;ome happy illumination upon an object at hand. Indeed this fortuitous circum&s;tance is often employed by painters with great effect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vol. I. p. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But when the&s;e <HI>fal&s;e &s;hadows,</HI> are patched again&s;t the <HI>&s;ide of a mountain,</HI> and held up
<PB N="154" REF="160">
to the eye in their full &s;ize and dimen&s;ions; they are almo&s;t ever accompanied with great con|fu&s;ion&mdash;A &s;un&s;hiny, windy day therefore, with &s;mall floating clouds, is the wor&s;t kind of wea|ther for viewing a mountainous country.</P>
<P>At the end of the vi&s;ta, we came to the brow of the hill, called the <HI>Ray,</HI> from whence we had a noble view. The &s;egment of a va&s;t circle, many leagues in circumference, opened before the eye. It was a cultivated vale, &s;kreened by Skiddaw, and other mountains, which winding round pu&s;hed their ba&s;es into it, in different directions; forming many bays, and promontories of broken ground as they united with the vale. In the middle, a portion of the lake of Ba&s;&s;enthwait made an ample &s;weep. Here beauty was introduced into our land&s;cape, and mixed with the &s;ublime. The whole valley indeed was amu&s;ing in a great degree; tho too exten&s;ive to be the object of paint|ing.</P>
<P>From the Ray de&s;cending into the vale, we had as grand a vi&s;ta formed by the lake
<PB N="155" REF="161">
of Ba&s;&s;enthwait, as had been formed by the mountains ju&s;t before. The lake of Ba&s;&s;en|thwait is not among the mo&s;t beautiful lakes of the north. It is about four miles long; and rarely more than half a mile in breadth. It &s;eldom therefore has &s;pace enough to bear it's proportion in the noble &s;cenes, in which it is engaged; e&s;pecially when viewed acro&s;s: but as we here took it in per&s;pective, it made a noble appearance, running up among the mountains, and lo&s;ing it&s;elf behind them. Skiddaw formed the left &s;kreen of this vi&s;ta; Thornthwait-cragg the right, and the moun|tains of Borrowdale filled the centre.</P>
<P>We had another very fine view of the lake at Ow&s;ebridge, where the river Derwent leaves the waters of Ba&s;&s;enthwait. Here al&s;o we &s;aw the lake in per&s;pective, which gives it a &s;preading appearance; and more con&s;equence, than it commonly has.&mdash;On it's banks &s;tands Armithwaite, where we had the &s;ame view over the lake, which the road had ju&s;t pre&s;ented to us.</P>
<P>We now approached the northern &s;ide of Skiddaw. This mountain is in mo&s;t parts
<PB N="156" REF="162">
&s;mooth, tame, and unfurni&s;hed. But on this &s;ide, it makes it's be&s;t apppearance. It is channelled and guttered, in it's higher parts; and often adorned with large proportions of rocky ground. In one place it exhibits two va&s;t ba&s;ons. The whole mountain &s;eems divided into an upper, and a lower region. The lower &s;preads into &s;heep-walks, which run as far as the guttered channels; and in many parts in&s;inuate them&s;elves among them, till all di&s;tinction of &s;urface is lo&s;t in the heights of the mountain. A greyi&s;h tint over|&s;pread the middle parts; contending with purple as it ro&s;e higher; till at length the purple gained the a&s;cendant, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the upper regions of the mountain.</P>
<P>This was the appearance, which Skiddaw exhibited at a &s;econd di&s;tance: but the road &s;oon brought us under it's ba&s;e, where all it's upper regions di&s;appeared; and we could &s;ee nothing but the immen&s;ity of it's &s;kirts.</P>
<P>Here we were entertained with another grand mountain-vi&s;ta. A concave part of the ba&s;e of Skiddaw, &s;weeping to the road, formed the near &s;kreen on the left; on the
<PB N="157" REF="163">
right was a chain of broken mountains, run|ning into per&s;pective; and the lake, having now changed it's form, appeared like a noble river, winding under them.</P>
<P>Our land&s;cape too had all the advantages, which light could give it. After a di&s;turbed day, the evening was &s;erene. All the <HI>fal&s;e &s;hadows</HI> had fled with the clouds; the lights were &s;trong, and permanent; and under &s;uch illumination, every mountain &s;ummit, and every woody knoll, had taken it's proper form, together with it's proper hue.</P>
<P>We &s;till continued winding round Skiddaw, the &s;ides of which are every where rather &s;helving, than &s;teep. But as we now began to veer round towards it's &s;outhern a&s;pect, we lo&s;t all the guttered channels, and rocky promontories which inve&s;ted the northern &s;ide of the mountain. Smooth pa&s;turage &s;eemed now to cloath it to the top.&mdash;The road is good every where round the mountain; which con|tinually &s;heds from it's &s;kirts a kind of &s;hi|vering, flaky &s;tratum, which binds hard, and is perfectly &s;mooth.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="164">We now came to the i&s;thmian part, which divides the two lakes of Ba&s;&s;enthwait, and Ke&s;wick. The beautiful meadows, at the head of the lake, full of cattle, made a plea|&s;ing appearance; contra&s;ted, as they were, with rocky mountains on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>As we approached &s;till nearer, the vale of Ke&s;wick, began to open; and we had a grand view of the mountains of Borrowdale; arrayed in all the &s;plendor of an evening-&s;un. The&s;e are among the mo&s;t broken of all the mountains of the north: and their ragged points, on a nearer approach, wear rather a fanta&s;tic form; but at the di&s;tance from which we now viewed them, every grote&s;que appearance was lo&s;t; and their broken points were admirably fitted to receive the &s;harp catches of light, with which they were all illumined. Below the mountains appeared the &s;kirts of the lake of Ke&s;wick. We &s;aw the whole &s;cene afterwards to great advantage, from the higher grounds, which fully com|mand this grand, and beautiful land&s;cape.</P>

<P>THO we had &s;een the lake of Ke&s;wick many times; yet &s;uch a &s;cene is an inexhau&s;tible fund of beauty. It always pre|&s;ents &s;omething new. Our next undertaking therefore was to ride round the lake, which we had never done before. It is about eleven miles in circumference. Amu&s;ing however as this circuit is, it &s;eems to have been &s;o little frequented, that altho we were under the conduct of an inhabitant of the place, we had &s;ome difficulty in finding even a bridle-road: and yet materials are &s;o plentiful, that a little expence might ea&s;ily make it commodious for wheels. Were the road better, the tour of the lake of Ke&s;wick would perhaps be one of the grande&s;t, and mo&s;t beautiful rides in Eng|land. You are not carried along the margin of the lake, which in many parts is probably
<PB N="160" REF="166">
ob&s;tructed by large promontories of rock running into the water; but you wind often among the higher grounds, and &s;lope along the &s;ides of the hills. The <HI>whole lake together</HI> you &s;eldom &s;ee: but you have, every where, the mo&s;t beautiful views of portions of it; open bays, deep rece&s;&s;es, and &s;preading &s;heets, accom|panied, both in the di&s;tance, and foregrounds, with &s;uch variety of rock, wood, and broken knolls, as few land&s;capes exhibit in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s.</P>
<P>From the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the lake, which we had traver&s;ed oftener than once, the we&s;t|ern &s;ide appears wa&s;te and barren. On the we&s;tern &s;ide, we had never been before; and were &s;urpri&s;ed to find it, what it did not appear at a di&s;tance, full of beautiful &s;cenery. Ring&s;ide-fell, which makes a part of it, is a grand, and well &s;haped mountain. The other mountains, between it and Ba&s;&s;enthwaite are too much broken.</P>
<P>Of the i&s;lands upon the lake we had &s;everal views; of Lord's i&s;land covered with wood; of St. Herbert's, newly planted with fir; and of Vicar's i&s;land, flat, plain, and culti|vated.
<PB N="161" REF="167">
In &s;ome places too we had a view of them all together.</P>
<P>Lodoar was in great penury, when we pa&s;t it. In&s;tead of roaring over the mighty rocks, which forms it's de&s;cent, it fell gently down, gliding among them with feeble tone, not having force of water, to re&s;i&s;t it's ob&s;truc|tions.</P>
<P>A circuit round the lake, naturally &s;ugge&s;ts the vi&s;ionary idea of improving it. If the whole lake (I mean the whole di&s;trict of land and water, contained within the circumference of the mountains,) belonged to one per&s;on, a nobler &s;cene for improvement could not well be conceived. This grand circumfer|ence, it is true, in all it's va&s;tne&s;s and extent, &s;ets at nought all human power; and re&s;i&s;ts every idea of improvement: yet &s;till in &s;ome parts an impre&s;&s;ion might be made. It might be rendered <HI>more acce&s;&s;ible</HI>&mdash;it might be <HI>cleared of deformities</HI>&mdash;it might be <HI>planted</HI>&mdash;and it might be <HI>decorated.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="168">In the fir&s;t place, it might be rendered <HI>more acce&s;&s;ible.</HI> We have ju&s;t &s;een how dif|ficult it is to get round the lake in it's pre&s;ent &s;tate. Half it's beauties are lo&s;t. An ea&s;y road therefore might be traced. I do not merely mean a good carriage road; but &s;uch a road, as might both form a plea&s;ing line in it&s;elf; and &s;hew the beauties of the lake to the be&s;t advantage. This improvement would require both ta&s;te, and &s;tudy. Many a &s;urvey of the lake &s;hould be taken, both from the higher and lower grounds, to find out, where the road might open on &s;ome beautiful part, without lo&s;ing it's own beauty &mdash;where it might run obliquely, and give only catching views&mdash;or where it might en|tirely lo&s;e all view of the lake. A pau&s;e in a grand continuation of &s;cenery, is often as plea&s;ing as in a concert of mu&s;ic. It makes the eye in one ca&s;e, as the ear in the other, more alert for every new exhibition.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this ample road round the lake, there might be a variety of paths, and &s;e|que&s;tered walks cut through it; from which, in &s;ome part or other, every &s;cene of the lake might be viewed in it's mo&s;t picture&s;que form.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="169">Our next bu&s;ine&s;s would be to <HI>remove deformities</HI>&mdash;&s;uch <HI>deformities</HI> e&s;pecially as ob|truded them&s;elves from the road, or paths. And here I &s;hould perhaps find a difficulty in &s;ettling with many people, what was a <HI>deformity.</HI> In <HI>nature's works</HI> there is &s;eldom any <HI>deformity.</HI> Rough knolls, and rocks, and broken ground, are of the very e&s;&s;ence of beautiful land&s;cape. It is man with his uten&s;ils, who prints the mark of <HI>deformity</HI> on Nature's works. Almo&s;t every thing in which he is concerned, I &s;hould wi&s;h to re|move. In the&s;e rough grounds indeed there is not much of this kind that offends; and &s;ome of his works, the cottage e&s;pecially, under particular circum&s;tances, is an object of beauty: tho in general the&s;e are not the &s;cenes which it &s;uits.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the beauties of nature, it may happen that &s;ome deformities, even in her operations may exi&s;t. We often ob&s;erve the craggy points and &s;ummits of mountains not well formed; and the mountain it&s;elf not exactly &s;haped. With the&s;e things however we mu&s;t re&s;t &s;atisfied.&mdash;Yet &s;ometimes, in
<PB N="164" REF="170">
&s;maller matters, a natural <HI>deformity</HI> may be done away. An awkward knoll, on the <HI>fore|ground,</HI> may offend; which art may remove, or at lea&s;t correct. It may remove al&s;o bu&s;hes, and rough underwood; which, tho often picture&s;que, are yet &s;ometimes in the way. It may remove al&s;o a tree, or a clump, which may have placed them&s;elves between the eye, and &s;ome beautiful part of the &s;cene. Farther than this we dare not move&mdash;unle&s;s perhaps we wi&s;h to give the line of the lake a more plea&s;ing &s;weep, by paring away cautiou&s;ly &mdash;very cautiou&s;ly&mdash;here and there a little of it's margin.</P>
<P>We begin next with <HI>planting.</HI> In this bu&s;ine&s;s the improver might wi&s;h to have the lake in it's primeval &s;tate &s;urrounded with ancient wood. He might wi&s;h that <HI>cutting away,</HI> rather than <HI>planting,</HI> &s;hould be nece&s;|&s;ary: but as that cannot be, he mu&s;t be con|te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t to plant: and this he mu&s;t do, chiefly for the &s;ake of po&s;terity, whom he mu&s;t leave <HI>to admire</HI> his work: for tho he may plant, it will require an age to bring his work to perfection.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="171">The chief u&s;es of planting in &s;cenery, are, to <HI>&s;et off beauty,</HI> and to <HI>hide</HI> &s;uch deformities as we cannot <HI>remove.</HI></P>
<P>Nature has various coverings for her &s;ur|faces. Gra&s;s is her principal, and general covering. This however is only a thin dre&s;s, clo&s;e and tight, which following the form of her limbs, gives little <HI>ornament</HI> to them. Weeds of various kinds, &s;hrubs, and bru&s;h|wood form another &s;pecies of ve&s;t, and often a rich one. But her riche&s;t, and mo&s;t orna|mental mantle, is wood, which &s;he &s;preads in various forms, and various colours, over the earth; and in uninhabited countries in &s;uch profu&s;ion often as to blot out land&s;cape. In inhabited countries however woods of this clo&s;e texture, and wide continuance, are un|common: yet we always wi&s;h for a command of &s;uch wood in all our improvements&mdash;not only for the rea&s;on already given, that old timber is more beautiful than young; but becau&s;e nature always plants with much more picture&s;que beauty, than man. Man cannot put a twig into the ground without formality: and if he put in a dozen together, let him put them in with what art he plea&s;e, his awkward handywork, will hardly ever be
<PB N="166" REF="172">
effaced. Nature would be a&s;hamed to own his work&mdash;at lea&s;t, till it had been matured by a long cour&s;e of years. The be&s;t mode of planting, is, to plant profu&s;ely; and thus to afford &s;cope for the felling axe. The felling axe is the in&s;trument, which gives the fini&s;hing touch of picture&s;que effect. It forms the outline; and marks the breaks. No human judgment can manage this bu&s;ine&s;s compleatly in the fir&s;t planting: yet human judgment, in the fir&s;t planting, &s;hould neverthele&s;s do what it can: and under the management of ta&s;te the&s;e artificial woods may attain great beauty; and vie in &s;ome degree with the &s;uperior effect of nature.</P>
<P>As for any particular rules for planting &s;uch a &s;cene as this, none can be given. They mu&s;t be adapted to the &s;pot. Foregrounds and backgrounds are equally &s;u&s;ceptible of the beauties of wood. Only, in general, contra&s;t &s;hould be ob&s;erved. The whole &s;ide of a hill for in&s;tance, &s;hould not be planted, but parts of it left bare. Sometimes the top may be planted; and &s;ometimes the bottom: and if the wood run down to the lake in one part; in another the contiguous &s;hore will perhaps appear better unadorned. The fore|grounds
<PB N="167" REF="173">
however mu&s;t generally be adorned with wood.</P>
<P>But wood, be&s;ides it's u&s;e in adorning land&s;cape, is of u&s;e al&s;o in hiding it's defor|mities. The lake and it's invirons, however beautiful, will always have many parts to hide. But to hide them from every &s;tation would be impo&s;&s;ible. In &s;o exten&s;ive a &s;cene they mu&s;t pre&s;ent them&s;elves in numberle&s;s places. And yet perhaps the &s;ame object may appear from one &s;tation as a beauty, and pre&s;ent it&s;elf from another as a deformity. All however that can be done on this head, is to have re&s;pect to the &s;everal roads, and paths you have marked out; and to en|deavour, as much as po&s;&s;ible, by trees on the foreground, to plant out, from thence at lea&s;t, every thing offen&s;ive. Even &s;ome of the ill-formed points, and prominences of mountains, where they are mo&s;t offen&s;ive, may be &s;kreened, in &s;ome views at lea&s;t, by the foliage of a &s;preading tree.</P>
<P>We come la&s;tly to the <HI>adorning</HI> of &s;uch a &s;cene as this. I mean the <HI>addition of artificial ornament.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="174">But before any <HI>mode of ornament</HI> can be &s;ettled, the que&s;tion mu&s;t be a&s;ked, For what <HI>purpo&s;e</HI> do you mean to adorn? Do you intend to build a man&s;ion in &s;ome part of the &s;cene? &mdash;Or, do you mean it only for the wild &s;ce|nery of a park; or what is commonly called a riding? We have yet done nothing, but what may be accommodated alike to both the&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>If you mean to <HI>build,</HI> it behoves you well to fix the &s;pot with judgment. I &s;hould traver&s;e the boundaries of the lake many times; examine it in all &s;ea&s;ons; and not determine a point of &s;uch importance, in le&s;s than half a &s;ummer. I &s;hould at once however re&s;olve not to follow the example of the earls of Der|wentwater, and choo&s;e one of the little, flat, unvaried i&s;lands for my re&s;idence. The&s;e i&s;lands may often make the <HI>object</HI> of a &s;cene: but none of them has extent to make a <HI>&s;cene it&s;elf;</HI> or to unite well with the &s;cenery around.</P>
<P>Having determined your &s;pot, and built your hou&s;e, you next <HI>adorn</HI> it. Much of the wild bru&s;hwood of the country mu&s;t give way; and an elegant neatne&s;s take place; which growing rougher by degrees, will unite it&s;elf
<PB N="169" REF="175">
with the wildne&s;s of the country. Having levelled the ground, where too rough, and and given an elegant play to it, you next plant your groves, and clumps, open your lawns, and conduct your walks. In all the&s;e things, the &s;ituation you have cho&s;en mu&s;t determine you. If it could be done commo|diou&s;ly, I &s;hould wi&s;h to have the grand lawn before the hou&s;e &s;weep down to the water's edge. And yet I &s;hould not be per|tinacious on this point, becau&s;e other views of the lake might be equally intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>When you have thus laid out your different &s;cenes, I &s;hould not object to your adorning &s;o large an extent with a temple, or two; provided they were objects plea&s;ing in them|&s;elves; adapted to their &s;ituations; and not both &s;een glaring together. I &s;hould not even object, if you cho&s;e to place &s;ome art|le&s;s object as a point of view on the other &s;ide of the lake: for I conclude your hou&s;e, or &s;ome of the grand walks, will open to the oppo&s;ite &s;hores. If you choo&s;e to adorn your di&s;tant view in this way, let not the object you make choice of, be &s;ome odd appearing thing, &s;taring from the top of a hill, like a tower, or a &s;pire, where you know no &s;uch
<PB N="170" REF="176">
thing could probably be placed. Neither let it &s;tand directly in the front of your view; the de&s;ign of it will be &s;u&s;pected. As to the <HI>kind of object,</HI> it mu&s;t be &s;omething, which will not di&s;grace your invention, if it is to be &s;een upon the &s;pot. It will be difficult to direct you. But if you he&s;itate about a proper ob|ject, you had better at once give up the in|tention.</P>
<P>But perhaps you do not mean to build a <HI>man&s;ion;</HI> but mean only to adorn the invirons of the lake, as a <HI>wild park &s;cene.</HI> In that ca&s;e little ornament will be wanting. If the ruins of a ca&s;tle, or abbey <HI>could be</HI> built, and &s;ta|tioned with veri&s;imilitude, and propriety, they would undoubtedly be a great ornament. Their &s;tation &s;hould be accommodated to the road, and walks; and yet mu&s;t appear, not as if fixed by de&s;ign, for the purpo&s;e of ornament; but as if naturally cho&s;en. They &s;hould al&s;o be in a magnificent &s;tyle. If you are &s;atisfied with bringing a few loads of brick, or &s;tone; and putting them together in &s;ome odd &s;hape, white|ning them over, and calling them a ruin, you had better do nothing. You may di&s;grace what you wi&s;hed to adorn; and &s;hould always
<PB N="171" REF="177">
remember that the &s;cene is able to &s;upport it&s;elf without any ornament.</P>
<P>I know no other ornaments proper to the invirons of the lake, except perhaps a bridge or two; for which I &s;hould think, there might be great choice of &s;ituations. But I &s;hould wi&s;h the form of them to be that of the <HI>rumbling brig</HI> in Scotland <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vol. I. page 125.</NOTE>; rather as joining rocky cha&s;ms, than as pa&s;&s;ages over rivulets. Of cour&s;e therefore they &s;hould be &s;o con&s;tructed, as to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of the road. The form of an aqueduct might be introduced with propriety. The Alpine bridge al&s;o might have a good effect. Such a bridge is con&s;tructed only of a few rough pines, &s;plit, and held together by raf|ters, and pins. Cha&s;ms, over which &s;uch bridges might be thrown, are frequent about the lake. But here too you mu&s;t follow the ideas of <HI>probability</HI> (which is <HI>nature</HI> as far as it goes) and throw the bridge over &s;ome part, where it appears really to be wanted. Your path mu&s;t lead over it; or at lea&s;t be directed over &s;ome &s;afer place in it's neigh|bourhood;
<PB N="172" REF="178">
that the <HI>danger of the bridge</HI> may appear plainly to be the <HI>cau&s;e of it's de&s;ertion.</HI> But in all matter of ornament, let me once more advi&s;e you to be &s;paring. I have heard, that, &s;ince the&s;e ob&s;ervations were made, the lake of Ke&s;wick, as well as other lakes, hath been injured by &s;ome mi&s;erable, and ta&s;tele&s;s orna|ments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From this cen&s;ure I &s;hould wi&s;h to exclude &s;ome improve|ments, which have lately been made on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the lake, by lord William Gordon.

Let me intreat you not to add to them; nor to incourage a wretched ta&s;te, which may in time, as each proprietor of the lake takes it into his head, creep every where around it; and de&s;troy by degrees the &s;impli|city, and beauty of one of the grande&s;t, and mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;cenes in Britain.</P>

<P>FROM Ke&s;wick we took the common road to Kendal; and were greatly amu|&s;ed, as we had often been before; with the grandeur and beauty of the &s;cenery; which two ideas go hand in hand through all this country. Sometimes one prevails: &s;ometimes the other: and &s;ometimes we are &s;truck with the united force of both. Ideas of &s;imple grandeur were generally. &s;ugge&s;ted between Ke&s;wick, and Amble&s;ide; and of beauty chiefly between Amble&s;ide, and Kendal.</P>
<P>From Kendal to Lanca&s;ter the country a&s;&s;umes a tamer a&s;pect. At Lanca&s;ter we could not avoid a&s;cending the ca&s;tle-hill, to admire the &s;cene of di&s;tant mountains it di&s;|played,
<PB N="174" REF="180">
tho we had often admired it before. But it was now attended with accompaniments, which were new to us; and which of cour&s;e made the &s;cene a new one; as all &s;cenes are, when viewed in different lights, and different &s;ea&s;ons. The day was rough, and boi&s;terous; and tho we had often &s;een this grand bay in a calm, we had never before &s;een it in a &s;torm. The tide had wholly over&s;pread it; and tho there was not depth of water (as the whole bay is at be&s;t but a flooded &s;and-bank) to &s;tir up the grand &s;wells of the ocean; yet it had depth enough to be greatly agi|tated.</P>
<P>But if it's waters wanted <HI>depth,</HI> they had <HI>extent</HI> fully proportioned to the mountains, that invironed them; and all together pro|duced a very grand effect. The greatne&s;s however of this noble exhibition aro&s;e chiefly from the adventitious circum&s;tances, which attended it. The violence of the &s;torm had confounded in one ma&s;s of driving vapours, air, &s;ea, and mountains; and the &s;ublimity lay in the emerging of each of the&s;e objects occa&s;ionally from the ma&s;s of confu&s;ion, in which it was involved. Sometimes the broad back of a mountain would appear; while
<PB N="175" REF="181">
the imagination was at a lo&s;s to find out on what ba&s;e the mighty fabric was erected: for all it's lower &s;kirts were ob&s;cured. Some|times the ba&s;e appeared whitened by the &s;urges of the &s;hore: while the &s;ummit of the moun|tain, involved in vapour, left the imagination to &s;eek it among the clouds. Even objects &s;till &s;maller, did not want their effect. The &s;erried files of &s;uch &s;ea-fowl as fly in flocks, urging their flight through the &s;torm in firm array, were contra&s;ted by others of a more devious cour&s;e; as the gull particularly, which turning her brea&s;t, and wings to the wind, gave her&s;elf to the bla&s;t; and was carried away far to leeward, as if delighted with &s;porting in the &s;torm: then, as the gu&s;t had &s;pent it's force, &s;he would recover her cour&s;e; mount again into the air, and again renew her aerial pa&s;time.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t ornaments of this boi&s;terous bay, were the &s;kiffs, which traver&s;ed it in various parts, making to the little ports, which lie along it's &s;hores. Their different forms, and groups, as they were tumbled about by the wind, were very amu&s;ing. One ve&s;&s;el there was of larger dimen&s;ions, which &s;eemed to have been out at &s;ea, and from her ragged
<PB N="176" REF="182">
&s;ails to have &s;uffered from the &s;torm. She was working her cour&s;e, with an adver&s;e wind, in <HI>tacks,</HI> as they phra&s;e it, athwart the bay. In &s;ome &s;ituations her appearance was formal: but when &s;he was fore&s;hortened, heeling from the wind, and driving the white|ned &s;ea before her, &s;he was very picture&s;que. Shake&s;pear had his beautiful moral ready on every occa&s;ion. On the exhibition of &s;uch a picture he would &s;ay,
<Q><L>&mdash;How like a prodigal</L>
<L>The &s;car&s;ed bark puts from her native bay,</L>
<L>Hugged, and embraced by the &s;trumpet wind!</L>
<L>How like a prodigal doth &s;he return,</L>
<L>With weather-beaten ribs, and ragged &s;ails,</L>
<L>Torn, crazed, and beggared by the &s;trumpet wind!</L></Q></P>
<P>In the mean time we could have wi&s;hed for a bur&s;t of re&s;plendency to throw, at inter|vals, a vivid ray on the land&s;cape&mdash;to brighten the mountain top, or the &s;welling &s;ail of the &s;kiff. Nothing is more picture&s;que, than a &s;torm thus enlightened<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Northern Tour, Vol. I. page 126.</NOTE>. But we were not &s;o fortunate. One gloomy tint over&s;pread the whole picture; and the &s;everal objects that
<PB N="177" REF="183">
were &s;een, were &s;een rather from an <HI>indi&s;tinct &s;hadow,</HI> than any <HI>effect of light.</HI></P>
<P>One appearance indeed we had of &s;olar illumination, which is of no u&s;e in enlighten|ing objects; but is exceedingly picture&s;que; and that is tho&s;e broad, diverging beams, which the &s;un, concealed behind a cloud, &s;hoots down through a cloudy horizon. But let the painter, when he adorns his land&s;cape with appearances of this kind, take care that they diverge naturally. Without a little phi|lo&s;ophy the be&s;t efforts of his pencil will be awkward. I have &s;een a picture, in which the arti&s;t wi&s;hed to adorn his land&s;cape with a rainbow; but thinking a &s;emicircle rather formal, he drew it in per&s;pective.</P>
<P>This bay, from the &s;etting of the currents, is at all times, &s;ubject to very rapid tides. But when the wind is &s;trong from the &s;outh|we&s;t, the waters ru&s;h in with a violence that is a&s;toni&s;hing; as many unfortunate travellers have fatally experienced. Nor is this the only danger, with which the&s;e pathle&s;s de&s;erts are attended. The tide often leaves them inter&s;per&s;ed with quick&s;ands, which vary their &s;ituation. As it &s;aves however &s;everal miles to cro&s;s this track of &s;and from Lanca&s;ter

to Ulver&s;ton, Cartmel, and the other towns upon the coa&s;t, you can &s;eldom look over it from the &s;tation where we now &s;tood, when the tide is at ebb; without &s;eeing it <HI>figured,</HI> as the land&s;cape-painter &s;peaks, with &s;everal pa&s;&s;engers; &s;ometimes &s;olitary, and &s;ometimes in companies. For the accommodation of travellers, the government pay two guides from the rents of Coni&s;hed-abbey, (as the monks formerly did) who relieve each other, and conduct pa&s;&s;engers, at &s;tated hours, over the mo&s;t dangerous parts: tho many people, who think they are as well acquainted with the fords them&s;elves, tru&s;t to their own di&s;|cretion.</P>

<P>AS we leave Lanca&s;ter, the broken coa&s;t &s;till affords us many views of land, and water, with &s;tretches of &s;and inter&s;per&s;ed: which to a common eye appear only barren tracts of drearine&s;s: but the picture&s;que eye finds often a great amu&s;ement in them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vol. I. page 132.</NOTE>; and if they are happily illumined, contemplates in them, &s;ome of the fine&s;t effects of har|mony. At this time indeed, they were under the influence of a rough unplea&s;ant day.</P>
<P>About a mile beyond Gar&s;tang, we had a very fine di&s;tant view of a different kind&mdash; different indeed from any thing we had &s;een
<PB N="180" REF="186">
for many weeks&mdash;a flat, woody country, terminated by light, azure hills, which ap|peared
<Q><L>&mdash;&s;mall, and undi&s;tingui&s;hable,</L>
<L>Like far-off mountains, turning into clouds.</L></Q>
They were &s;uch in fact. We here took a farewell view of the mountainous country, we had pa&s;&s;ed. The <HI>far-off mountains</HI> became by degrees <HI>&s;mall and undi&s;tingui&s;hable;</HI> and &s;oon <HI>turning into clouds,</HI> di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>The general character of all this country, through which we now travelled, is that of flat, and woody. About Charnock the ground is varied, and the &s;cenery more beautiful.</P>
<P>In Lanca&s;hire we frequently ob&s;erved a breed of large cattle, which in the country is called the <HI>wag-horn breed,</HI> from the manner, in which the horn bends under the eye. In other countries I have heard them called <HI>lough-horned;</HI> but throughout England, they are commonly known by the name of the <HI>Lanca&s;hire breed of cattle.</HI> They are &s;aid to be fle&s;hy, and more proper for the &s;hambles, than the dairy:

<PB N="181" REF="189">
tho in Lanca&s;hire we were told, they are e&s;teemed the be&s;t milch-cows. Their twi&s;ted horns give them a peculiar, and picture&s;que ca&s;t of countenance.</P>
<P>The country between Wigan, and War|rington &s;till continues flat, and woody. The &s;oil is a loo&s;e &s;and, in&s;omuch that the poplar, and other quick growing trees, who&s;e roots creep about the &s;urface, often receive a ca&s;t from the wind, which gives them a di&s;agree|able appearance. An inclined tree may be picture&s;que; but to make it &s;o, it mu&s;t always be well-balanced. A tree, which inclines, when it is young, naturally forms a balance, as it grows; but when it takes an inclined direction, after it is full grown, it immedi|ately appears to be in an unnatural &s;tate.</P>
<P>The lanes in this country are plea&s;ant; but the roads are rough. The &s;oil produces no materials to make them: and the inhabi|tants are obliged to fetch &s;tones from the Welch coa&s;t; the freight and carriage of which rai&s;es the expence of the roads, in many parts, to the enormous &s;um of one thou&s;and pounds a mile.</P>
<P>Here and there in pa&s;&s;ing through the country, we have long flat di&s;tances; over
<PB N="182" REF="190">
which ri&s;e the high grounds of Derby&s;hire. A new hou&s;e, built by Mr. Smith Barry, commands an exten&s;ive woody flat of this kind towards Che&s;hire, bounded by Delamere-fore&s;t. But his brother's hou&s;e &s;tands more plea&s;antly by the &s;ide of Marberry-mere, which is a con&s;iderable, and beautiful piece of water.</P>
<P>By degrees the face of the country becomes more varied. We admire a woody dip at Wynchcomb-bridge; and near it a common, plea&s;antly circled with clumps, and &s;ingle trees. Mowcap hill, crowned with a &s;ort of ca&s;tle-like form, which has a good effect, is &s;een far and wide, adorning as a back|ground all the &s;cenes in it's neighbourhood. It is a poor &s;ub&s;titute for a Scotch mountain; yet it is &s;ufficient to remind us frequently, in our different views of it, of the great u&s;e of high grounds in land&s;cape.&mdash;As we approach Trentham, the country a&s;&s;umes a &s;till more varied appearance.</P>
<P>Trentham is the &s;eat of earl Gower, now marqui&s;s of Stafford. When we were la&s;t in this country, a wet day prevented our &s;eeing more of it, than we could di&s;cover from
<PB N="183" REF="191">
the road<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ob&s;ervations, &amp;c. V. I. p. 75.</NOTE>. We had now the opportunity of a fine evening, and &s;aw it to better advan|tage. The hou&s;e &s;tands low; at the bottom of a woody hill, on the banks of the Trent: and tho there is nothing very peculiarly &s;trik|ing in the &s;ituation; yet it con&s;i&s;ts of con|&s;iderable variety in point of ground, wood, and water. Of all this Mr. Brown, who was called in to improve it, has made a ma&s;terly u&s;e; and has adapted with great judgement his im|provements to the ground. The contrivance is more varied, than the works of this arti&s;t com|monly are; and the re&s;ult is, a &s;cene of great &s;implicity, and beauty&mdash;I may add, of magni|ficence al&s;o. The Trent is here a river of no great con&s;equence; but being checked in it's cour&s;e by a head, it forms a large piece of water, which &s;weeps along the &s;ide of the park, where the ground from the wooded hill falls beautifully into it in all directions. A very elegant walk likewi&s;e is conducted, fir&s;t by the edge of the water; and then among the woods; from many parts of which the hou&s;e makes a magnificent appearance beyond the lake, forming picture&s;que reflections upon it's
<PB N="184" REF="192">
&s;urface. The &s;hores of the water on the &s;ide oppo&s;ite to the park, have little to recom|mend them at pre&s;ent. They are flat, newly planted, and without any effect: and the head, or mole, has yet rather an awkward appear|ance; running a con&s;iderable way like a hedge. Whether a lake, or a river, is aimed at, the extremities &s;hould be provided for; and if the artificial &s;quarene&s;s of the mole, which forms the lake, cannot be hid, or di&s;gui&s;ed; the idea of a <HI>lake</HI> &s;hould be dropped, and that of a <HI>river</HI> adopted. Pliny's rule, tho given on a different occa&s;ion, cannot be too &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved. <HI>Ambire debet &s;e extremitas; et &s;ic definere, ut promittat alia po&s;t &s;e; o&s;tendatque quae occultat.</HI>&mdash;But as a dozen years have now elap&s;ed, &s;ince the&s;e ob&s;ervations were made; many improvements may have taken place; and the whole line of the lake may be altered. Upon the whole however we &s;eldom &s;ee a piece of artificial ground, which from it's variety, and management, is more capable of gaining the attention.&mdash;A very fine ap|proach to the park, on the &s;ide next Stone, is now forming. The line is good in which it is marked out round a hill. Hand&s;ome gates are already erected.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="193">From Trentham to Stone, the road is plea|&s;ant, winding among hills; but as we enter more into Stafford&s;hire, the country lo&s;es it's beauty.</P>
<P>Enville, the &s;eat of the earl of Stamford, &s;tands low; but mo&s;t of the grounds, which belong to it are high: and the&s;e high grounds are the mo&s;t beautiful appendages of the place. They are &s;imple &s;heep-walks, and con&s;i&s;t of large lawns, and plantations intermixed; but are more varied, more natural, and more plea&s;ing, than the neighbouring lawns of the celebrated Hagley. They pretend to no de|coration, but that of nature: and when nature, at any time conde&s;cends with her own hand to decorate a &s;cene, removing what is offen|&s;ive, and bringing before the eye &s;uch objects only as plea&s;e, (whether of the &s;ublime, or, as here, of the pa&s;toral kind) it is &s;urely paying her no very high compliment, to &s;ay, &s;he exceeds the utmo&s;t attempts of art. In the&s;e grounds if any art hath been u&s;ed, it hath been u&s;ed with great judgement. To
<PB N="186" REF="194">
this plea&s;ing foreground is added a di&s;tance, proportioned to it in extent, and equal to it in beauty. We overlook an exten&s;ive view on both &s;ides. On one towards the Clent, and Malvern-hills; and on the other as far as the Wrekin. I cannot de&s;cribe this di&s;|tance better, than in the words of Thom&s;on, who &s;pent much of his time in this country, and &s;eems to have collected all the ingredients of this land&s;cape from &s;ome hill in the neigh|bourhood.
<Q><L>Mean time you gain the height, from who&s;e fair brow</L>
<L>The bur&s;ting pro&s;pect &s;preads immen&s;e around:</L>
<L>And &s;natch'd o'er hill and dale, and wood and lawn,</L>
<L>And verdant field, and darkening heath between,</L>
<L>And villages imbo&s;omed &s;oft in trees,</L>
<L>And &s;piry towns by du&s;ky columns mark'd</L>
<L>Of ri&s;ing &s;moak, your eye excur&s;ive roams.</L></Q>
We &s;trayed a long time among the&s;e beautiful lawns, before we de&s;cended to the lower grounds. One view, in our de&s;cent, parti|cularly plea&s;ed us. It is a valley, &s;kreened on each &s;ide with wood; and bounded by di&s;tant country, and mountains. The lower grounds near the hou&s;e, are more decorated by art, as they certainly ought to be: but it was unfortunate, that we had not &s;een them,
<PB N="187" REF="195">
before we &s;aw the &s;heep-walks. From &s;uch an exhibition it required &s;ome time to bring the eye in humour with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing artificial &s;cene.</P>
<P>From Enville the country grows unplea&s;ant. On the left we have good views about the hun|dred and &s;ixth &s;tone. Per&s;hore-church, as you approach, and the di&s;tances beyond it, make a good picture.&mdash;The celebrated vale of Eve&s;|ham po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es little that is picture&s;que. It is a mere extended &s;cene of cultivation. Vales of this kind have no place in land&s;cape, but the di&s;tance. They afford no circum&s;tances on the &s;pot. Near the clo&s;e of the vale, a little to the right of Broadway-hill, the &s;kreen of the vale is woody and more beautiful. The view as we de&s;cend Porten-hill is very amu&s;ing. It lies chiefly within the compa&s;s of a &s;econd di&s;tance.&mdash;Soon after we deviated a few miles to &s;ee Bul&s;trode.</P>
<P>Bul&s;trode, belongs to the duche&s;s dowager of Portland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now to the duke of Portland.</NOTE>. The park is a plea&s;ant, rather
<PB N="188" REF="196">
than a &s;triking &s;cene. It con&s;i&s;ts of a great variety of ri&s;ing and falling grounds, without water indeed; but in many parts well-planted, and every where &s;imple, and unforced.</P>
<P>On a height, in one part of it, is a cir|cular flat, about half a mile in circumference, which has evidently been a camp; but whe|ther of Briti&s;h, Dani&s;h, or Roman &s;tructure, is not ea&s;ily known. You plainly trace a mound, and a double ditch. The &s;cene it&s;elf, &s;urrounded by wood, is plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e formerly belonged to the cele|brated Judge Jeffereys, but is now greatly altered and improved. It &s;tands on a gentle ri&s;e, which &s;lopes into a &s;emicircular valley, compo&s;ed of park-&s;cenery. The approach, which was formerly regular, winds now, in an ea&s;y line, along a valley. Behind the hou&s;e runs the garden; where plants, and flowers of every kind, find their proper &s;oil and &s;hel|ter. One large portion is called the American grove; con&s;i&s;ting of the plants of that con|tinent. Here too the duche&s;s has her mena|gery. She is fond of animals; and among many that are curious, incourages the very &s;quirrels and hares to enjoy a &s;tate of perfect
<PB N="189" REF="197">
tranquillity. The &s;quirrel cracks his nut at your elbow; and looks at you without di&s;|may: while the hare, at her plea&s;ure, takes her morning and evening gambols about the park, which &s;he con&s;iders as her own domain. When the bell rings for dinner, a &s;ervant carries out a ba&s;ket of corn, which he lays in little heaps upon the lawn, before the dining-room windows. The hares know both the &s;ignal, and the intention of their bene|factre&s;s; and a&s;&s;embling from all parts, bring their little families with them, and enjoy their meal in great comfort.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e contains &s;ome good pictures. One particularly, by Rubens, in which he has given &s;everal different attitudes of him&s;elf, and his three wives, is much admired. There are al&s;o two or three well-painted heads. Two lions pur&s;uing a fawn, by Rubens, are thought capital. The lions are good; but unnaturally introduced. They are quarrelling about a fawn, before they have taken it. The truth is, the fawn does not belong to the lions. We have them in other pictures with|out it. Lord Warwick, I believe, has the lions without the fawn.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="198">The hall is hung with a large collection of huntings by Snyders. In the bear and bull-baiting are &s;ome excellent dogs; but in general the&s;e pictures are only ha&s;ty compo|&s;itions.</P>
<P>Among the works of art at Bul&s;trode, which abounds chiefly with the curio&s;ities of nature, we were favoured with a &s;ight of one by Mrs. Delany, which we greatly admired. Mrs. Delany, is widow of the late Dr. Delany, dean of Down, one of the intimate friends of dean Swift. She is now &s;eventy-&s;ix years of age, and enjoys her faculties in &s;uch vigour, that you find not the lea&s;t faultering in any of them. The work of hers, which I allude to, is an herbal, in which &s;he has executed a great number of plants, and flowers, both natives, and exotics, not only with exact de|lineation, and almo&s;t in their full lu&s;tre of colour, but in great ta&s;te. And what is the mo&s;t extraordinary, her only materials are bits of paper of different colours. In the proce&s;s of her work, &s;he pulls the flower in pieces, examines anatomically the &s;tructure of it's leaves, &s;tems, and buds; and having cut her papers to the &s;hape of the &s;everal parts, &s;he puts them together; giving them a richne&s;s,
<PB N="191" REF="199">
and con&s;i&s;tence by laying one piece over ano|ther; and often a tran&s;parent piece over part of a &s;hade, which &s;oftens it. Very rarely &s;he gives any colour with a bru&s;h. She pa&s;tes them, as &s;he works, upon a black ground, which at fir&s;t I thought rather injured them; as a middle tint would have given more &s;trength to the &s;hades: but I doubt whether it would have an&s;wered in effect. The&s;e flowers have both the beauty of painting, and the exactne&s;s of botany: and the work, I have no doubt, into whatever hands it may here|after fall, will long be con&s;idered as a great curio&s;ity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Delany died in the beginning of the year 1788. She continued her work, till within two, or three years of her death; and compleated nine volumes in folio; each vo|lume containing one hundred plants.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From Bul&s;trode we took the Uxbridge road. At Hillingdon, oppo&s;ite to the church, &s;tands a very noble cedar of Lebanon; indeed almo&s;t the only truly picture&s;que tree of the kind, I ever met with.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="200">Soon after we entered Houn&s;low-heath, and called at Witton, which belonged formerly to the duke of Argyle. The duke was the greate&s;t connoi&s;&s;eur in trees of any man in England; and naturalized great numbers. He piqued him&s;elf on having his trees in the greate&s;t perfection. If a tree did not <HI>imme|diately</HI> thrive, he never waited for it's growth, but put in another. In the hou&s;e and gar|dens, there is little be&s;ides, that is remark|able.</P>
<P>From Witton we proceeded through Twic|kenham; where the garden of Pope is &s;till &s;hewn, in the &s;tate in which he left it. It is &s;urprizing to &s;ee &s;uch an effort of real ta&s;te, at a time, when the country was barbarous in all it's ideas of gardening. He is &s;aid to have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Kent; but I think it not at all a determined point, whether he did not give Kent more a&s;&s;i&s;tance than he received. Pope certainly a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf the merit of forming this piece of ground; and u&s;ed often to &s;ay, with perhaps &s;ome
<PB N="193" REF="201">
little degree of affectation, that of all his works, he valued him&s;elf mo&s;t on his garden. &mdash;What Sir William Stanhope added af|terwards, tho he had the ideas of a more improved day to guide him, is very inferior.</P>
<P>As we leave Twickenham, the Thames opens beautifully, and forms a fine reach. But notwith&s;tanding it's beauty, and even grandeur&mdash;the richne&s;s of it's banks&mdash;and the gorgeous villas, that crown them, it &s;till falls &s;hort, in a picture&s;que light, of a Scotch river, with all it's rough accompaniments, pouring over rocks, and forming a thou&s;and little foaming eddies. The eye, &s;o long in the habit of admiring the wild &s;cenes of na|ture, cannot ea&s;ily forget tho&s;e inchanting images. Every kindred object rai&s;es a recol|lection of the pa&s;t; and every recollection, a compari&s;on, in which the tame, tho inriched &s;cenes of art are &s;ure to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>To enumerate only in a catalogue, the &s;e|veral &s;plendid villas, that adorn even this part of the Thames, would be tedious. What
<PB N="194" REF="202">
is chiefly the object of a &s;tranger's notice is Mr. Walpole's hou&s;e at Strawberry-hill. He has rebuilt it (for it was before an old man|&s;ion) in the Gothic &s;tyle, as the mo&s;t proper receptacle for the many curious, and rich remains of antiquity, with which it is adorned. But through the inability of his architects, particularly of Langley (who, tho e&s;teemed capital in his day, knew nothing of the art of con&s;tructing modern Gothic) his ideas were never properly executed. Mr. Walpole often complained they were rather Moori&s;h, than Gothic: however, as he could not, at that day, procure better a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he was obliged to acquie&s;ce in what he could not amend. He was always however among the fir&s;t to depreciate his own architecture.</P>
<P>With regard to the in&s;ide of his hou&s;e, he early &s;aw that in&s;ipid ta&s;te prevailing, which is now &s;o general, of adorning walls, and cielings, with light, faint, gaudy colours; and endeavoured to introduce a tone of har|mony into his apartments; and to relieve the furniture by an oppo&s;ition of colour in the rooms, where it was placed. He always how|ever lamented, that he fell &s;hort of his own de&s;igns: but &s;till he rai&s;ed the admiration
<PB N="195" REF="203">
of others, who had a le&s;s accurate ta&s;te than he had him&s;elf; and were plea&s;ed with &s;ome|thing, which they could not account for.</P>
<P>The garden contains about ten acres. It con&s;i&s;ts of a lawn, and open grove; and is con&s;idered only as a foreground to a beau|tiful bend of the Thames, and the land&s;cape beyond it, which di&s;plays &s;ome of the rich di&s;tances in that neighbourhood&mdash;very unlike indeed the grand, and &s;imple views, we had &s;een in the highlands of Scotland; but more a&s;&s;imilated to the character of a &s;outhern coun|ty. A Scotch land&s;cape beyond the rich views of the Thames, would be as ab&s;urd in a picture, as it would be unnatural in a real view.</P>
<P>In an angle of the garden &s;tands a Gothic chapel, containing a lofty, rich &s;hrine of ancient Mo&s;aic, which is exceedingly curious.</P>
<P>But tho the hou&s;e is richly adorned with remains of antiquity, which pre&s;ent them|&s;elves in every apartment; yet they are a &s;mall part of tho&s;e rarer productions of art&mdash; drawings&mdash;medals&mdash;enamels&mdash;and miniatures, which are contained in cabinets.

<PB N="196" REF="204">
con&s;i&s;t of the portraits of eminent men, I &s;uppo&s;e few private collections are either &s;o copious, or &s;o curious.</P>

<P>Since the la&s;t &s;heet of this work was printed, I have received &s;ome circum&s;tances with regard to the affair of Paul Jones (mentioned in the 105th page of the &s;econd volume) which I am de|&s;ired to add.</P>
<P>Soon after the &s;hips left the bay, Jones informed Lord Selkirk by a letter, that he avowed indeed the intention of carrying his lord&s;hip off; but with a de&s;ign merely to get a cartel e&s;tabli&s;hed, through the means of &s;uch a pri&s;oner. As to taking the plate, he &s;aid, he totally di&s;avowed it: his crew forced him to it; being determined to have a little plunder, for the ri&s;k they had run both in Kircudbright-bay; and in attempting, the night before, to burn the &s;hipping at Whitehaven.&mdash;To this apology Jones added a promi&s;e to re&s;tore the plate; which, on the peace, &s;even years after the depredation, was punctually performed, It was put into the hands of Lord Selkirk's banker in London; and not the lea&s;t article was mi&s;&s;ing.&mdash;This re&s;titution has the appearance of gene|ro&s;ity: but I think it probable, that Jones might feel for his pro|fe&s;&s;ional character, which he found would &s;uffer under the infamy of &s;uch a pilfering tran&s;action.</P>

<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF THE PRINTS.</HEAD>
<P>WITH regard to the prints, which adorn the&s;e volumes, I can only &s;ay, what I have &s;aid of tho&s;e in other publications of the &s;ame kind; that few of them pretend to be <HI>exact portraits.</HI> They in general <HI>only charac|terize the countries,</HI> through which the reader is carried. They were &s;lightly taken in the cour&s;e of a ha&s;ty journey; and at be&s;t meant only to pre&s;erve the great lines of the country: and even this, I fear not always accurately. I have heretofore made confe&s;&s;ion to the public, that when I have &s;een a line out of place, I have a great propen&s;ity to correct it by one that is more picture&s;que.</P>
<P>I would not however wi&s;h the&s;e drawings to be con&s;idered merely as the effu&s;ions of
<PB N="ii" REF="207">
fancy. In tho&s;e views, in which the features are &s;trong, and prominent, as in the approach to Edinburgh, to Sterling, and to Dunbarton, I hope, <HI>the character of the place</HI> is tolerably con|veyed; in others, which offer nothing &s;triking, <HI>the character of the country</HI> only is attempted.</P>
<P>But indeed, on &s;o &s;mall a &s;cale, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to give an adequate idea of a grand &s;cene. However exact the portrait might be, yet under &s;uch paltry dimen&s;ions, the eye would revolt again&s;t the idea of grandeur. Were it painted indeed with exactne&s;s on a pane of gla&s;s in a window, and the eye brought to it, under the deception of it's being a real view; the imagination might aggrandize it. But I am clearly of opinion, that without deception, a few inches of paper can never give any thing like an adequate idea of gran|deur.</P>
<P>And here I am glad of an opportunity of mentioning a &s;et of Scotch views, which will &s;oon be publi&s;hed; and will intirely &s;uper|&s;ede any portraits, which at be&s;t I could have given. They are on the large &s;cale of twenty-five inches by eighteen; which is both a good &s;ize, and a good proportion. And tho prints even of this magnitude are nothing,
<PB N="iii" REF="208">
when compared to the grand &s;cenes of nature; yet as they are larger than prints of land&s;cape commonly are, the eye gives them &s;ome cre|dit for the dimen&s;ions they repre&s;ent. The&s;e views were drawn, (and, I believe, will be etched,) by Mr. Jo&s;eph Farington.</P>
<P>I am not in the lea&s;t acquainted with that arti&s;t: but as I have admired &s;everal of his prints from the drawings, he made on the lakes of Cumberland, and We&s;tmoreland; I cannot forego the plea&s;ure of mentioning the&s;e Scotch views, which I doubt not will be in the &s;ame &s;tile of excellence. Mr. Farington's &s;cheme is very exten&s;ive, comprehending &s;e|veral parts of Scotland: but the views he now offers to the public, are taken from the &s;cenery about Edinburgh, Sterling, and the banks of the Forth; which are, &s;o far, in the direct rout de&s;cribed in the&s;e pages; and I &s;erve my&s;elf in mentioning them. They are an appendix to my work. The&s;e views, I under|&s;tand al&s;o by the propo&s;als, will &s;till be ren|dered more valuable by explanatory de&s;criptions of each by Mr. Knox of the antiquarian &s;ociety at Edinburgh.</P>
<P>But tho in compari&s;on with &s;uch grand views, as I take it for granted the&s;e will be,
<PB N="iv" REF="209">
I &s;peak contemptibly of my own <HI>diminutive</HI> drawings; yet I hope I may offer them to the public with &s;ome little confidence, as <HI>pictures</HI> at lea&s;t as far as they go, tho not as exact <HI>portraits.</HI> Of the free, and elegant manner, in which they are executed by Mr. Alkin in aquatinta, who compleated the whole work him&s;elf, I can &s;peak with great a&s;&s;urance. He has given me much &s;atisfaction; and I hope he will give equal &s;atisfaction to the public. The elegance of his workman&s;hip makes up for the defects of the drawings.</P>

<P>Among the Errata of the&s;e volumes I think it proper to correct an error of more con&s;equence in a &s;imilar work, which I have no other means of correcting. In the preface to &s;ome picture&s;que ob&s;ervations I lately publi&s;hed on the Lakes and Mountains of Cumberland, and We&s;tmoreland, I a&s;&s;ert (p. 16) that <HI>Gothic ar|chitecture is no where found, but in England; except in &s;uch parts of France, as were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="225">I have &s;ince found this to be a mi&s;take. I had &s;uppo&s;ed indeed, that all the old buildings on the Continent, were of a kind of anomalous architecture, very different from what we denominate Gothic in England. But a friend, who had contributed to lead me into the mi&s;take, has &s;ince led me out of it. He is a good judge of Saxon and Gothic architecture in their various combi|nations; and informs me in a letter from Germany, that the great church at Cologne, which he had examined on the &s;pot, is very much in the &s;tyle of York-min&s;ter; tho upon a more ample plan. The cathedral too at Ulm is pure Gothic; tho the ori|ginal plan neither there, nor at Cologne is compleated. The great chruch at Auxerre in Burgundy he thought at lea&s;t equal in elegance to any Gothic building he had any where &s;een; tho it wants the grandeur of the lengthened i&s;le. Even the cathe|dral of Milan he found true Gothic. In &s;hort, he traced that &s;tile of architecture not only in the cathedrals, but in the pari&s;h-churches, through France, Germany, and Italy, as far as Naples.&mdash;The <HI>hi&s;tory</HI> of Gothic architecture appears to me there|fore to be very little known. We can trace Grecian and Roman architecture, howewer &s;cattered through Europe, to one common origin: but where &s;hall we &s;eek the origin of Saxon, and Gothic?</P>
