<HEAD>AN HISTORY OF INSECTS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Caterpillars in General.</HEAD>
<P>IF we take a cur&s;ory view of in&s;ects in ge|neral,
caterpillars alone, and the butterflies and moths they give birth to, will make
a third part of the number. Wherever we move, wherever we turn, the&s;e
in&s;ects, in one &s;hape or another, pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our view. Some,
in every &s;tate, offer the mo&s;t entertain|ing &s;pectacle; others are
beautiful only in their winged form. Many per&s;ons, of which number I am one,
have an invincible aver&s;ion to caterpillars, and worms of every &s;pecies:
there is &s;omething di&s;agreeable in their &s;low crawling motion, for which
the variety of their colouring can never compen&s;ate. But others feel no
repugnance at ob&s;erving, and even handling them with the mo&s;t attentive
application.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">There is nothing in the butterfly &s;tate,
&s;o beau|tiful or &s;plendid as the&s;e in&s;ects. They &s;erve, not le&s;s
than the birds them&s;elves, to bani&s;h &s;o|litude from our walks, and to
fill up our idle in|tervals with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;peculations. The
butterfly makes one of the principal ornaments of oriental poetry; but, in
tho&s;e countries, the in&s;ect is larger and more beautiful than with us.</P>
<P>The beauties of the fly may therefore very well excite our
curio&s;ity to examine the reptile. But we are &s;till more &s;trongly attached
to this tribe, from the u&s;efulne&s;s of one of the number. The &s;ilkworm is,
perhaps, the mo&s;t &s;erviceable of all other animals; &s;ince, from its
labours, and the manufacture attending it, near a third part of the world are
cloathed, adorned, and &s;upported.</P>
<P>Caterpillars may be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from worms or
maggots, by the number of their feet; and by their producing butterflies of
moths. When the &s;un calls up vegetation, and vivifies the various eggs of
in&s;ects, the caterpillars are the fir&s;t that are &s;een, upon almo&s;t
every vegetable and tree, eating its leaves, and preparing for a &s;tate of
greater perfection. They have feet both before and behind; which not only
enable them to move forward by a &s;ort of &s;teps made by their fore and
hinder parts, but al&s;o to climb up ve|getables, and to &s;tretch them&s;elves
out from the boughs and &s;talks, to reach their food at a <PB N="5" REF="7">
di&s;tance. All of this cla&s;s have from eight feet at the lea&s;t, to
&s;ixteen; and this may &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the worm tribe,
that never have &s;o many. The animal into which they are converted, is always
a butterfly or a moth; and the&s;e are always di&s;tingui&s;hed from other
flies, by having their wings covered over with a painted du&s;t, which gives
them &s;uch various beauty. The wings of flies are tran&s;|parent, as we &s;ee
in the common fle&s;h fly; while tho&s;e of beetles are hard, like horn: from
&s;uch the wing of a butterfly may be ea&s;ily di&s;tin|gui&s;hed; and words
would ob&s;cure their dif|ferences.</P>
<P>From hence it appears, that caterpillars, whether in the reptile
&s;tate, or advanced to their la&s;t &s;tate of perfection into butterflies,
may ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other in&s;ects; being animals
peculiarly formed, and al&s;o of a pe|culiar nature. The tran&s;mutations they
undergo, are al&s;o more numerous than tho&s;e of any in&s;ect hitherto
mentioned; and, in con&s;equence, they have been placed in the third order of
changes by Swammerdam, who has thrown &s;uch lights upon this part of natural
hi&s;tory. In the &s;econd order of changes, mentioned before, we &s;aw the
gra&s;s|hopper and the earwig, when excluded from the egg, a&s;&s;ume a form
very like that which they <PB N="6" REF="8"> were after to pre&s;erve; and
&s;eemed arrived at a &s;tate of perfection, in all re&s;pects, except in not
having wings; which did not bud forth until they were come to maturity. But the
in|&s;ects of this third order, that we are now about to de&s;cribe, go through
a much greater variety of transformations: for, when they are excluded from the
egg, they a&s;&s;ume the form of a &s;mall caterpillar, which feeds and grows
larger every day, often changing its &s;kin, but &s;till pre&s;erving its form.
When the animal has come to a cer|tain magnitude in this &s;tate, it
di&s;continues eat|ing, makes it&s;elf a covering or hu&s;k, in which it
remains wrapped up, &s;eemingly without life or motion; and after having for
&s;ome time con|tinued in this &s;tate, it once more bur&s;ts its con|finement,
and comes forth a beautiful butterfly. Thus we &s;ee this animal put on no
le&s;s than three different appearances, from the time it is fir&s;t excluded
from the egg. It appears a crawling caterpillar; then an in&s;en&s;ible
aurelia, as it is called, without life or motion; and la&s;tly, a butterfly,
variou&s;ly painted, according to its different kind. Having thus
di&s;tingui&s;hed this cla&s;s of in&s;ects from all others, we will fir&s;t
&s;ur|vey their hi&s;tory in general; and then enter par|ticularly into the
manners and nature of a few of them, which mo&s;t de&s;erve our curio&s;ity and
attention.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Transformations of the Caterpillar into its
corre&s;ponding Butterfly or Moth.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN winter has di&s;robed the trees of their leaves, Nature
then &s;eems to have lo&s;t her in|&s;ects. There are thou&s;ands of different
kinds, with and without wings; which, though &s;warming at other &s;ea&s;ons,
then entirely di&s;appear. Our fields are re-peopled, when the leaves begin to
bud, by the genial influence of &s;pring; and ca|terpillars, of various
&s;orts, are &s;een feeding upon the promi&s;e of the year, even before the
leaves are completely unfolded. Tho&s;e caterpillars, which we then &s;ee, may
&s;erve to give us a view of the general means which Nature employs to
pre&s;erve &s;uch a number of in&s;ects during that &s;ea&s;on, when they can
no longer find &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. It is known, by united experience, that all
the&s;e animals are hatched from the eggs of butterflies; and tho&s;e who
ob&s;erve them more clo&s;ely, will find the fly very careful in depo&s;iting
its eggs in tho&s;e places where they are likely to be hatched with the
greate&s;t &s;afety and &s;ucce&s;s. During winter, therefore, the greate&s;t
number of ca|terpillars are in an egg &s;tate; and in this lifele&s;s 
<PB N="8" REF="10"> &s;ituation, brave all the rigours and the humi|dity of the
climate: and though often expo&s;ed to all its changes, &s;till pre&s;erve the
latent prin|ciples of life, which is more fully exerted at the approach of
&s;pring. That &s;ame power that pu&s;hes forth the budding leaf, and the
opening flower, impels the in&s;ect into animation; and Nature at once &s;eems
to furni&s;h the gue&s;t and the banquet. When the in&s;ect has found force to
break its &s;hell, it always finds its favourite aliments provided in abundance
before it.</P>
<P>But all caterpillars are not &s;ent off from the egg in the
beginning of &s;pring; for many of them have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted during the winter
in their au|relia &s;tate: in which, as we have briefly ob&s;erved above, the
animal is &s;eemingly deprived of life and motion. In this &s;tate of
in&s;en&s;ibility, many of the&s;e in&s;ects continue during the rigours of
winter; &s;ome enclo&s;ed in a kind of &s;hell, which they have &s;pun for
them&s;elves at the end of autumn; &s;ome concealed under the bark of trees;
others in the chinks of old walls; and many buried under ground. From all
the&s;e, a variety of butterflies are &s;een to i&s;&s;ue, in the beginning of
&s;pring; and adorn the earlie&s;t part of the year with their painted
flutterings.</P>
<P>Some caterpillars do not make any change what&s;oever at the
approach of winter; but con|tinue <PB N="9" REF="11"> to live in their reptile
&s;tate, through all the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on. The&s;e chu&s;e
them|&s;elves &s;ome retreat, where they may remain un|di&s;turbed for &s;ome
months together; and there they remain, quite motionle&s;s, and as
in&s;en&s;ible as if they were actually dead. Their con&s;titution is &s;uch,
that food, at that time, would be u&s;e|le&s;s; and the cold prevents their
making tho&s;e di&s;&s;ipations which require re&s;toration. In ge|neral,
caterpillars of this kind are found in great numbers together, enclo&s;ed in
one common web, that covers them all, and &s;erves to protect them from the
injuries of the air.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, there are &s;ome of the caterpillar kind, who&s;e
butterflies live all the winter; and who, having fluttered about for &s;ome
part of the latter end of autumn, &s;eek for &s;ome retreat during the winter,
in order to an&s;wer the ends of pro|pagation, at the approach of &s;pring.
The&s;e are often found lifele&s;s and motionle&s;s in the hol|lows of trees,
or the clefts of timber; but, by being approached to the fire, they recover
life and activity, and &s;eem to anticipate the de&s;ires of the &s;pring.</P>
<P>In general, however, whether the animal has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in
an egg &s;tate, during the winter; or whether as a butterfly, bred from an
aurelia, in the beginning of &s;pring; or a butterfly that <PB N="10" REF="12">
has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted during the winter, and lays eggs as &s;oon as the leaves of
plants are &s;hot forward, the whole &s;warm of caterpillars are in motion to
&s;nare the banquet that Nature has provided. There is &s;carce a plant that
has not its own pe|culiar in&s;ects; and &s;ome are known to &s;upport
&s;everal of different kinds. Of the&s;e, many are hatched from the egg, at the
foot of the tree, and climb up to its leaves for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: the eggs of
others, have been glued by the parent butterfly to the leaves; and they are no
&s;ooner excluded from the &s;hell, but they find them|&s;elves in the mid&s;t
of plenty.</P>
<P>When the caterpillar fir&s;t bur&s;ts from the egg, it is
&s;mall and feeble; its appetites are in pro|portion to its &s;ize, and it
&s;eems to make no great con&s;umption: but as it encrea&s;es in magnitude, it
improves in its appetites; &s;o that, in its adult caterpillar &s;tate, it is
the mo&s;t ravenous of all animals what&s;oever. A &s;ingle caterpillar will
eat double its own weight of leaves in a day, and yet &s;eems no way
di&s;ordered by the meal.&mdash;What would mankind do, if their oxen or their
hor&s;es were &s;o voracious!</P>
<P>The&s;e voracious habits, with its &s;low crawling motion, but
&s;till more a &s;tinging like that of nettles, which follows upon handling the
greate&s;t number of them, make the&s;e in&s;ects not the mo&s;t 
<PB N="11" REF="13"> agreeable objects of human curio&s;ity. However, there are
many philo&s;ophers who have &s;pent years in their contemplation; and who have
not only attended to their habits and labours, but mi|nutely examined their
&s;tructure and internal conformation.</P>
<P>The body of the caterpillar, when anato|mically con&s;idered, is
found compo&s;ed of rings, who&s;e circumference is pretty near circular or
oval. They are generally twelve in number, and are all membraneous; by which
caterpillars may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from many other in&s;ects, that nearly
re&s;emble them in form. The head of the caterpillar is connected to the
fir&s;t ring by the neck; that is generally &s;o &s;hort and con|tracted, that
it is &s;carce vi&s;ible. All the co|vering of the head in caterpillars &s;eems
to con&s;i&s;t of a &s;hell; and they have neither upper nor un|der jaw, for
they are both placed rather verti|cally, and each jaw armed with a large thick
tooth, which is &s;ingly equal to numbers. With the&s;e the animals devour
their food in &s;uch amazing quantities; and with the&s;e, &s;ome of the kind
defend them&s;elves again&s;t their ene|mies. Though the mouth be kept &s;hut,
the teeth are always uncovered; and while the in&s;ect is in health, they are
&s;eldom without employ|ment. Whatever the caterpillar devours, the&s;e 
<PB N="12" REF="14"> teeth &s;erve to chop it into &s;mall pieces, and render
the parts of the leaf fit for &s;wallowing. Many kinds, while they are yet
young, eat only the &s;ucculent part of the leaf, and leave all the fibres
untouched; others, however, attack the whole leaf, and eat it clean away. One
may be amu&s;ed, for a little time, in ob&s;erving the avidity with which they
are &s;een to feed; &s;ome are &s;een eating the whole day; others have their
hours of repa&s;t; &s;ome chu&s;e the night, and others the day. When the
caterpillar attacks a leaf, it places its body in &s;uch a manner that the edge
of the leaf &s;hall fall between its feet, which keeps it &s;teady, while the
teeth are em|ployed in cutting it: the&s;e fall upon the leaf, &s;omewhat in
the manner of a pair of gardener's &s;heers; and every mor&s;el is &s;wallowed
as &s;oon as cut. Some caterpillars feed upon leaves &s;o very narrow, that
they are not broader than their mouths; in this ca&s;e the animal is &s;een to
devour it from the point, as we would eat a radi&s;h.</P>
<P>As there are various kinds of caterpillars, the numbers of their
feet are various; &s;ome having eight, and &s;ome &s;ixteen. Of the&s;e feet
the &s;ix foremo&s;t are covered with a &s;ort of &s;hining gri&s;tle; and are
therefore called the &s;helly legs. The hindmo&s;t feet, whatever be 
<PB N="13" REF="15"> their number, are &s;oft and flexible, and are called
membranaceous. Caterpillars al&s;o, with regard to their external figure, are
either &s;mooth, or hairy. The &s;kin of the fir&s;t kind is &s;oft to the
touch, or hard, like &s;hagreen; the &s;kin of the latter, is hairy, and as it
were thorny; and generally, if handled, &s;tings like nettles. Some of them
even cau&s;e this &s;tinging pain, if but approached too nearly.</P>
<P>Caterpillars, in general, have &s;ix &s;mall black &s;pots
placed on the circumference of the fore ring, and a little to the &s;ide of the
head. Three of the&s;e are larger than the re&s;t, and are convex and
tran&s;parent: the&s;e Reaumur takes to be the eyes of the caterpillar;
however, mo&s;t of the&s;e reptiles have very little occa&s;ion for &s;ight,
and &s;eem only to be directed by their feeling.</P>
<P>But the parts of the caterpillar's body which mo&s;t ju&s;tly
demand our attention, are the &s;tigmata, as they are called; or tho&s;e holes
on the &s;ides of its body, through which the animal is &s;uppo&s;ed to
breathe. All along this in&s;ect's body, on each &s;ide, the&s;e holes are
ea&s;ily di&s;|coverable. They are eighteen in number, nine on a &s;ide, rather
nearer the belly than the back; a hole for every ring, of which the animal's
body is compo&s;ed, except the &s;econd, the third, and the la&s;t. The&s;e
oval openings may be con|&s;idered <PB N="14" REF="16"> as &s;o many mouths,
through which the in&s;ect breathes; but with this difference, that as we have
but one pair of lungs, the caterpillar has no le&s;s than eighteen. It requires
no great anatomical dexterity to di&s;cover the&s;e lungs in the larger kind of
caterpillars: they appear, at fir&s;t view, to be hollow cartilaginous tubes,
and of the colour of mother-of-pearl. The&s;e tubes are often &s;een to unite
with each other; &s;ome are perceived to open into the inte&s;tines; and &s;ome
go to different parts of the &s;urface of the body. That the&s;e ve&s;&s;els
&s;erve to convey the air, appears evidently, from the famous expe|riment of
Malpighi; who, by &s;topping up the mouths of the &s;tigmata with oil, quickly
&s;uf|focated the animal, which was &s;een to die con|vul&s;ed the in&s;tant
after. In order to a&s;certain his theory, he rubbed oil upon other parts of
the in&s;ect's body, leaving the &s;tigmata free; and this &s;eemed to have no
effect upon the ani|mal's health, but it continued to move and eat as u&s;ual:
he rubbed oil on the &s;tigmata of one &s;ide, and the animal underwent a
partial con|vul&s;ion, but recovered &s;oon after. However, it ought to be
ob&s;erved, that air is not &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the&s;e as to the nobler
ranks of animals, &s;ince caterpillars will live in an exhau&s;ted re|ceiver
for &s;everal days together; and though <PB N="15" REF="17"> they &s;eem dead
at the bottom, yet, when taken out, recover, and re&s;ume their former
vivacity.</P>
<P>If the caterpillar be cut open longitudinally along the back,
its inte&s;tines will be perceived running directly in a &s;traight line from
the mouth to the anus. They re&s;emble a number of &s;mall bags opening into
each other; and &s;trengthened on both &s;ides by a fle&s;hy cord, by which
they are united. The&s;e in&s;ects are, upon many occa&s;ions, &s;een to ca&s;t
forth the internal coat of their inte&s;tines with their food, in the changes
which they &s;o frequently undergo. But the inte&s;tines take up but a &s;mall
part of the animal's body, if compared to the fatty &s;ub|&s;tance in which
they are involved. This &s;ub|&s;tance changes its colour when the in&s;ect's
me|tamorpho&s;is begins to approach; and from white it is u&s;ually &s;een to
become yellow. If to the&s;e parts, we add the caterpillar's imple|ments for
&s;pinning, (for all caterpillars &s;pin at one time or another) we &s;hall
have a rude &s;ketch of this animal's conformation: however, we &s;hall
re&s;erve the de&s;cription of tho&s;e parts, till we come to the hi&s;tory of
the &s;ilk-worm, where the manner in which the&s;e in&s;ects &s;pin their webs,
will mo&s;t properly find place.</P>
<P>The life of a caterpillar &s;eems one continued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of changes; and it is &s;een to throw off <PB N="16" REF="18"> one &s;kin only
to a&s;&s;ume another; which al&s;o is dive&s;ted in its turn: and thus for
eight or ten times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. We mu&s;t not, however, confound this
changing of the &s;kin with the great metamorpho&s;is which it is afterwards to
undergo. The throwing off one &s;kin, and a&s;&s;uming another, &s;eems, in
compari&s;on, but a &s;light operation among the&s;e animals: this is but the
work of a day; the other is the great adventure of their lives. Indeed, this
faculty of changing the &s;kin, is not peculiar to caterpillars only, but is
common to all the in&s;ect kind; and even to &s;ome animals that claim a higher
rank in nature. We have already &s;een the lob&s;ter and the crab out-growing
their fir&s;t &s;hells, and then bur&s;ting from their confine|ment, in order
to a&s;&s;ume a covering more roomy and convenient. It is probable that the
lou&s;e, the flea, and the &s;pider, change their covering from the &s;ame
nece&s;&s;ity; and growing too large for the cru&s;t in which they have been
for &s;ome time enclo&s;ed, bur&s;t it for another. This period is probably
that of their growth; for as &s;oon as their new &s;kin is hardened round them,
the animal's growth is nece&s;&s;arily cir|cum&s;cribed, while it remains
within it. With re&s;pect to caterpillars, many of them change their &s;kins
five or &s;ix times in a &s;ea&s;on; and <PB N="17" REF="19"> this covering,
when ca&s;t off, often &s;eems &s;o complete, that many might mi&s;take the
empty &s;kin for the real in&s;ect. Among the hairy ca|terpillars, for
in&s;tance, the ca&s;t &s;kin is covered with hair; the feet, as well gri&s;tly
as mem|braneous, remain fixed to it; even the parts which nothing but a
micro&s;cope can di&s;cover, are vi&s;ible in it; in &s;hort, all the parts of
the head; not only the &s;kull, but the teeth.</P>
<P>In proportion as the time approaches in which the caterpillar is
to ca&s;t its old &s;kin, its colours become more feeble, the &s;kin &s;eems to
wither and grow dry, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;embles a leaf, when it is no
longer &s;upplied with moi&s;ture from the &s;tock. At that time, the in&s;ect
begins to find it&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of changing; and it is not
effected without violent labour, and perhaps pain. A day or two before the
critical hour approaches, the in&s;ect cea&s;es to eat, lo&s;es its u&s;ual
activity, and &s;eems to re&s;t immoveable. It &s;eeks &s;ome place to remain
in &s;e|curity; and no longer timorous, &s;eems regardle&s;s even of the touch.
It is now and then &s;een to bend it&s;elf and elevate its back; again it
&s;tretches to its utmo&s;t extent: it &s;ometimes lifts up the head, and then
lets it fall again; it &s;ometimes waves it three or four times from &s;ide to
&s;ide, and then remains in quiet. At length, &s;ome of <PB N="20" REF="20">
within from the view; but in others, where it is more tran&s;parent, the
caterpillar, when it has done &s;pinning, &s;trikes into it the claws of the
two feet under the tail, and afterwards forces in the tail it&s;elf, by
contracting tho&s;e claws, and violently &s;triking the feet one again&s;t the
other. If, however, they be taken from their web at this time, they appear in a
&s;tate of great languor; and, incapable of walking, remain on that &s;pot
where they are placed. In this condition they remain one or two days,
pre|paring to change into an aurelia; &s;omewhat in the manner they made
preparations for changing their &s;kin. They then appear with their bodies bent
into a bow, which they now and then are &s;een to &s;traiten: they make no
u&s;e of their legs; but if they attempt to change place, do it by the
contortions of their body. In proportion as their change into an aurelia
approaches, their body becomes more and more bent; while their exten&s;ions and
con|vul&s;ive contractions become more frequent. The hinder end of the body is
the part which the animal fir&s;t di&s;engages from its caterpillar &s;kin;
that part of the &s;kin remains empty, while the body is drawn up contractedly
towards the head. In the &s;ame manner they di&s;engage them&s;elves from the
two &s;ucceeding rings; &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
the animal is then lodged entirely in the <PB N="21" REF="21"> fore part of its
caterpillar covering: that half which is abandoned, remains flacid and empty;
while the fore part, on the contrary, is &s;wolen and di&s;tended. The animal,
having thus quitted the hinder part of its &s;kin, to drive it&s;elf up into
the fore part, &s;till continues to heave and work as before; &s;o that the
&s;kull is &s;oon &s;een to bur&s;t into three pieces, and a longitudinal
opening is made in the three fir&s;t rings of the body, through which the
in&s;ect thru&s;ts forth its naked body, with &s;trong efforts. Thus at la&s;t,
it entirely gets free from its cater|pillar &s;kin, and for ever for&s;akes its
mo&s;t odious reptile form.</P>
<P>The caterpillar, thus &s;tripped of its &s;kin for the la&s;t
time, is now become an aurelia; in which the parts of the future butterfly are
all vi&s;ible; but in &s;o &s;oft a &s;tate, that the &s;malle&s;t touch can
di&s;compo&s;e them. The animal is now become helple&s;s and motionle&s;s; but
only waits for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the air to dry up the moi&s;ture on its
&s;urface, and &s;upply it with a cru&s;t capable of re&s;i&s;ting external
injuries. Im|mediately after being &s;tripped of its caterpillar &s;kin, it is
of a green colour, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e parts which are di&s;tended by an
extraordinary afflux of animal moi&s;ture; but in ten or twelve hours after
being thus expo&s;ed, its parts harden, <PB N="20" REF="22">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="21" REF="23">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="24" REF="24"> their
glutinous &s;ilk, make a kind of pa&s;te, in which they wrap them&s;elves up.
Many are the forms which the&s;e animals a&s;&s;ume in this help|le&s;s
&s;tate; and it often happens, that the mo&s;t deformed butterflies i&s;&s;ue
from the mo&s;t beau|tiful aurelias.</P>
<P>In general, however, the aurelia takes the rude outline of the
parts of the animal which is contained within it; but as to the various
co|lours which it is &s;een to a&s;&s;ume, they are rather the effect of
accident; for the &s;ame &s;pecies of in&s;ect does not at all times a&s;&s;ume
the &s;ame hue, when it becomes an aurelia. In &s;ome, the beautiful gold
colour is at one time found; in others, it is wanting. This brilliant hue,
which does not fall &s;hort of the be&s;t gilding, is formed in the &s;ame
manner in which we &s;ee leather ob|tain a gold colour, though none of that
metal ever enters into the tincture. It is only formed by a beautiful brown
varni&s;h, laid upon a white ground; and the white thus gleaming through the
tran&s;parency of the brown, gives a charming golden yellow. The&s;e two
colours are found, one over the other, in the aurelia of the little animal we
are de&s;cribing; and the whole ap|pears gilded, without any real gilding.</P>
<P>The aurelia thus formed, and left to time to expand into a
butterfly, in &s;ome mea&s;ure re|&s;embles <PB N="25" REF="25"> an animal in
an egg, that is to wait for external warmth to hatch it into life and vigour.
As the quantity of moi&s;ture that is enclo&s;ed within the covering of the
aurelia, continues to keep its body in the mo&s;t tender &s;tate, &s;o it is
requi&s;ite that this humidity &s;hould be dried away, before the little
butterfly can bur&s;t its pri&s;on. Many have been the experiments to prove
that nature may in this re&s;pect be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by art; and that the life
of the in&s;ect may be retarded or quickened, without doing it the &s;malle&s;t
injury. For this purpo&s;e, it is only requi&s;ite to continue the in&s;ect in
its aurelia &s;tate, by preventing the evaporation of its hu|midity; which will
con&s;equently add &s;ome days, nay weeks, to its life: on the other hand, by
evaporating its moi&s;ture, in a warm &s;ituation, the animal a&s;&s;umes its
winged &s;tate before its u&s;ual time, and goes through the offices
a&s;&s;igned its exi&s;tence. To prove this, Mr. Reaumur enclo&s;ed the aurelia
in a gla&s;s tube; and found the evaporated water, which exhaled from the body
of the in&s;ect, collected in drops at the bottom of the tube: he covered the
aurelia with varni&s;h; and this making the evaporation more difficult and
&s;low, the butterfly was two months longer than its natural term, in coming
out of its ca&s;e: he found, on the other hand, <PB N="26" REF="26"> that by
laying the animal in a warm room, he ha&s;tened the di&s;clo&s;ure of the
butterfly; and by keeping it in an ice-hou&s;e in the &s;ame manner, he delayed
it. Warmth acted, in this ca&s;e, in a double capacity; invigorating the
animal, and evaporating the moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>The aurelia, though it bears a different ex|ternal appearance,
neverthele&s;s contains within it all the parts of the butterfly in perfect
form|ation; and lying each in a very orderly manner, though in the &s;malle&s;t
compa&s;s. The&s;e, how|ever, are &s;o fa&s;t and tender, that it is
impo&s;&s;ible to vi&s;it without di&s;compo&s;ing them. When either by warmth,
or encrea&s;ing vigour, the parts have acquired the nece&s;&s;ary force and
&s;o|lidity, the butterfly then &s;eeks to di&s;embarra&s;s it&s;elf of tho&s;e
bands which kept it &s;o long in confinement. Some in&s;ects continue under the
form of an aurelia not above ten days; &s;ome twenty; &s;ome &s;everal months;
and even for a year together.</P>
<P>The butterfly, however, does not continue &s;o long under the
form of an aurelia, as one would be apt to imagine. In general, tho&s;e
caterpillars that provide hem&s;elves with cones, continue within them but a
few days after the cone is completely fini&s;hed. Some, however, remain buried
in this artificial covering for eight <PB N="27" REF="27"> or nine months,
without taking the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;tenance during the whole time: and
though in the caterpillar &s;tate no animals were &s;o vora|cious, when thus
transformed, they appear a miracle of ab&s;tinence. In all, &s;ooner or later,
the butterfly bur&s;ts from its pri&s;on; not only that natural pri&s;on which
is formed by the &s;kin of the aurelia, but al&s;o from that artificial one of
&s;ilk, or any other &s;ub&s;tance in which it has enclo&s;ed it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The efforts which the butterfly makes to get free from its
aurelia &s;tate, are by no means &s;o violent as tho&s;e which the in&s;ect had
in changing from the caterpillar into the aurelia. The quan|tity of moi&s;ture
&s;urrounding the butterfly is by no means &s;o great as that attending its
former change; and the &s;hell of the aurelia is &s;o dry, that it may be
cracked between the fingers.</P>
<P>If the animal be &s;hut up within a cone, the butterfly always
gets rid of the natural internal &s;kin of the aurelia, before it eats its way
through the external covering which its own indu&s;try has formed round it. In
order to ob&s;erve the manner in which it thus gets rid of the aurelia
covering, we mu&s;t cut open the cone, and then we &s;hall have an opportunity
of di&s;covering the in&s;ect's efforts to emancipate it&s;elf from its natural
&s;hell. When this operation begins, there <PB N="28" REF="28"> &s;eems to be a
violent agitation in the humours contained within the little animal's body. Its
fluids &s;eem driven, by an ha&s;ty fermentation, through all the ve&s;&s;els;
while it labours violently with its legs, and makes &s;everal other violent
&s;truggles to get free. As all the&s;e motions concur with the growth of the
in&s;ect's wings and body, it is impo&s;&s;ible that the brittle &s;kin which
covers it &s;hould longer re&s;i&s;t: it at length gives way, by bur&s;ting
into four di&s;tinct and regular pieces. The &s;kin of the head and legs
fir&s;t &s;eparates; then the &s;kin at the back flies open, and di|viding into
two regular portions, di&s;engages the back and wings: then there likewi&s;e
happens another rupture in that portion which covered the rings of the back of
the aurelia. After this, the butterfly, as if fatigued with its &s;truggles,
remains very quiet for &s;ome time, with its wings pointed downwards, and its
legs fixed in the &s;kin which it had ju&s;t thrown off. At fir&s;t &s;ight the
animal, ju&s;t &s;et free, and permitted the future u&s;e of its wings, &s;eems
to want them entirely: they take up &s;uch little room, that one would wonder
where they were hidden. But &s;oon after, they expand &s;o rapidly, that the
eye can &s;carce attend their unfolding. From reach|ing &s;carce half the
length of the body, they acquire, in a mo&s;t wonderful manner, their full 
<PB N="29" REF="29"> extent and bigne&s;s, &s;o as to be each five times larger
than they were before. Nor is it the wings alone that are thus encrea&s;ed: all
their &s;pots and paintings, before &s;o minute as to be &s;carce
di&s;cernible, are proportionably extended; &s;o that, what a few minutes
before &s;eemed only a number of confu&s;ed, unmeaning points, now become
di&s;tinct and mo&s;t beautiful ornaments. Nor are the wings, when they are
thus ex|panded, unfolded in the manner in which ear|wigs and gra&s;shoppers
di&s;play theirs, who unfurl them like a lady's fan: on the contrary, tho&s;e
of butterflies actually grow to their natural &s;ize in this very &s;hort
&s;pace. The wing, at the in&s;tant it is freed from its late confinement, is
con|&s;iderably thicker than afterwards; &s;o that it &s;preads in all its
dimen&s;ions, growing thinner as it becomes broader. If one of the wings be
plucked from the animal ju&s;t &s;et free, it may be &s;pread by the fingers,
and it will &s;oon become as broad as the other, which has been left behind. As
the wings extend them&s;elves &s;o &s;uddenly, they have not yet had time to
dry; and accord|ingly appear like pieces of wet paper, &s;oft, and full of
wrinkles. In about half an hour, they are perfectly dry, their wrinkles
entirely di&s;|appear, and the little animal a&s;&s;umes all its &s;plendor.
The tran&s;mutation being thus per|fectly <PB N="30" REF="30"> fini&s;hed, the
butterfly di&s;charges three or four drops of a blood-coloured liquid, which
are the la&s;t remains of its &s;uperfluous moi&s;ture. Tho&s;e aurelias which
are enclo&s;ed within a cone, find their exit &s;till more difficult, as they
have &s;till another pri&s;on to break through: this, however, they perform in
a &s;hort time; for the butterfly, freed from its aurelia &s;kin, butts with
its head violently again&s;t the walls of its artificial pri&s;on; and probably
with its eyes, that are rough and like a file, it rubs the internal &s;urface
away; till it is at la&s;t &s;een bur&s;ting its way into open light; and, in
le&s;s than a quarter of an hour, the animal acquires its full per|fection.</P>
<P>Thus, to u&s;e the words of Swammerdam, we &s;ee a little
in&s;ignificant creature di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, in its la&s;t birth, with
qualifications and ornaments, which man, during his &s;tay upon earth, can
never even hope to acquire. The butterfly, to enjoy life, needs no other food
but the dews of Heaven; and the honeyed juices which are di&s;tilled from every
flower. The pageantry of princes cannot equal the orna|ments with which it is
inve&s;ted; nor the rich colouring that embelli&s;hes its wings. The &s;kies
are the butterfly's proper habitation, and the air its element: whil&s;t man
comes into the <PB N="31" REF="31"> world naked, and often roves about without
habitation or &s;helter; expo&s;ed, on one hand, to the heat of the &s;un; and,
on the other, to the damps and exhalations of the earth; both alike enemies of
his happine&s;s and exi&s;tence.&mdash;A &s;trong proof that, while this little
animal is rai&s;ed to its greate&s;t height, we are as yet, in this world, only
candidates for perfection!</P>

<PB N="32" REF="32">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of Butterflies and Moths.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been already &s;hewn that all Butterflies are bred from
caterpillars; and we have exhi|bited the various circum&s;tances of that
&s;ur|prizing change. It has been remarked, that butterflies may be ea&s;ily
di&s;tingui&s;hed from flies of every other kind, by their wings; for, in
others, they are either tran&s;parent, like gauze, as we &s;ee in the common
fle&s;h fly; or they are hard and cru&s;ted, as we &s;ee in the wings of the
beetle. But in the butterfly, the wings are &s;oft, opake, and painted over
with a beautiful du&s;t, that comes off with handling.</P>
<P>The number of the&s;e beautiful animals is very great; and
though Linnaeus has reckoned up above &s;even hundred and &s;ixty different
kinds, the catalogue is &s;till very incomplete. Every collector of butterflies
can &s;hew unde&s;cribed &s;pecies: and &s;uch as are fond of minute
di&s;|covery, can here produce animals that have been examined only by
him&s;elf. In general, however, tho&s;e of the warm climates, are larger and
more beautiful than &s;uch as are bred at home; and we can ea&s;ily admit the
beauty of <PB N="33" REF="33"> the butterfly, &s;ince we are thus freed from
the damage of the caterpillar. It has been the amu&s;ement of &s;ome to collect
the&s;e animals, from different parts of the world; or to breed them from
caterpillars at home. The&s;e they arrange in &s;y&s;tematic order; or
di&s;po&s;e &s;o as to make &s;triking and agreeable pictures: and all mu&s;t
grant, that this &s;pecious idlene&s;s is far pre|ferable to that unhappy
&s;tate which is produced by a total want of employment.</P>
<P>The wings of butterflies, as was ob&s;erved, fully
di&s;tingui&s;h them from flies of every other kind. They are four in number;
and though two of them be cut off, the animal can fly with the two others
remaining. They are, in their own &s;ub&s;tance, tran&s;parent; but owe their
opa|city to the beautiful du&s;t with which they are covered; and which has
been likened, by &s;ome naturali&s;ts, to the feathers of birds; by others, to
the &s;cales of fi&s;hes; as their imaginations were di&s;po&s;ed to catch the
re&s;emblance. In fact, if we regard the wing of a butterfly with a good
micro&s;cope, we &s;hall perceive it &s;tudded over with a variety of little
grains of different dimen&s;ions and forms, generally &s;upported upon a
foot&s;talk, regularly laid upon the whole &s;ur|face. Nothing can exceed the
beautiful and regular arrangement of the&s;e little &s;ub&s;tances; 
<PB N="34" REF="34"> which thus &s;erve to paint the butterfly's wing, like the
tiles of an hou&s;e. Tho&s;e of one rank are a little covered by tho&s;e that
follow: they are of many figures: on one part of the wing may be &s;een a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of oval &s;tuds; on ano|ther part, a clu&s;ter of &s;tuds,
each in the form of an heart: in one place they re&s;emble a hand open; and in
another they are long or trian|gular; while all are inter&s;per&s;ed with
taller &s;tuds, that grow between the re&s;t, like mu&s;h|rooms upon a &s;talk.
The wing it&s;elf is com|po&s;ed of &s;everal thick nerves, which render the
con&s;truction very &s;trong, though light; and though it be covered over with
thou&s;ands of the&s;e &s;cales or &s;tuds, yet its weight is very little
encrea&s;ed by the number. The animal is with ea&s;e enabled to &s;upport
it&s;elf a long while in air, although its flight be not very graceful. When it
de&s;igns to fly to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, it a&s;cends and de&s;cends
alternately; going &s;ome|times to the right, &s;ometimes to the left, with|out
any apparent rea&s;on. Upon clo&s;er exa|mination, however, it will be found
that it flies thus irregularly in pur&s;uit of its mate; and as dogs bait and
quarter the ground in pur&s;uit of their game, &s;o the&s;e in&s;ects
traver&s;e the air, in que&s;t of their mates, whom they can di&s;cover at more
than a mile's di&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="35">If we pro&s;ecute our de&s;cription of the
but|terfly, the animal may be divided into three parts; the head, the
cor&s;elet, and the body.</P>
<P>The body is the hinder part of the butterfly, and is compo&s;ed
of rings, which are generally concealed under long hair, with which that part
of the animal is cloathed. The cor&s;elet is more &s;olid than the re&s;t of
the body, becau&s;e the fore wings, and the legs, are fixed therein. The legs
are &s;ix in number, although four only are made u&s;e of by the animal; the
two fore legs being often &s;o much concealed in the long hair of the body,
that it is &s;ometimes difficult to di&s;cover them. If we examine the&s;e
parts in|ternally, we &s;hall find the &s;ame &s;et of ve&s;&s;els in the
butterfly that we ob&s;erved in the caterpillar, but with this great
difference; that as the blood, or humours, in the caterpillar, circulated from
the tail to the head, they are found, in the but|terfly, to take a direct
contrary cour&s;e, and to circulate from the head to the tail; &s;o that the
caterpillar may be con&s;idered as the embryo animal, in which, as we have
formerly &s;een, the circulation is carried on differently from what it is in
animals when excluded.</P>
<P>But leaving the other parts of the butterfly, let us turn our
attention particularly to the head. The eyes of butterflies have not all the
&s;ame <PB N="36" REF="36"> form; for, in &s;ome they are large, in others
&s;mall; in &s;ome they are the larger portion of a &s;phere, in others they
are but a &s;mall part of it, and ju&s;t appearing from the head. In all of
them, however, the outward coat has a lu&s;tre, in which may be di&s;covered
the various colours of the rainbow. When examined a little clo&s;ely, it will
be found to have the ap|pearance of a multiplying gla&s;s; having a great
number of &s;ides, or facets, in the man|ner of a brilliant cut diamond. In
this par|ticular, the eye of the butterfly, and of mo&s;t other in&s;ects,
entirely corre&s;pond; and Luen|hoek pretends, there are above &s;ix thou&s;and
facets on the cornea of a flea. The&s;e animals, therefore, &s;ee not only with
great clearne&s;s; but view every object multiplied in a &s;urprizing manner.
Puget adapted the cornea of a fly in &s;uch a po&s;ition, as to &s;ee objects
through it by the means of a micro&s;cope; and nothing could exceed the
&s;trangene&s;s of its repre&s;entations: a &s;oldier, who was &s;een through
it, appeared like an army of pigmies; for while it multi|plied, it al&s;o
dimini&s;hed the object: the arch of a bridge exhibited a &s;pectacle more
magni|ficent than human &s;kill could perform; the flame of a candle &s;eemed a
beautiful illumi|nation. It &s;till, however, remains a doubt, 
<PB N="37" REF="37"> whether the in&s;ect &s;ees objects &s;ingly, as with one
eye; or whether every facet is it&s;elf a com|plete eye, exhibiting its own
object di&s;tinct from all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Butterflies, as well as mo&s;t other flying in&s;ects, have two
in&s;truments, like horns, on their heads, which are commonly called feelers.
They dif|fer from the horns of greater animals, in being moveable at their
ba&s;e; and in having a great number of joints, by which means the in&s;ect is
enabled to turn them in every direction. Tho&s;e of butterflies are placed at
the top of the head, pretty near the external edge of each eye. What the u&s;e
of the&s;e in&s;truments may be, which are thus formed with &s;o much art, and
by a Work|man who does nothing without rea&s;on, is as yet unknown to man. They
may &s;erve to guard the eye; they may be of u&s;e to clean it; or they may be
the organ of &s;ome &s;en&s;e which we are ignorant of: but this is only
explaining one difficulty by another.</P>
<P>We are not &s;o ignorant of the u&s;es of the trunk, which few
in&s;ects of the butterfly kind are without. This in&s;trument is placed
exactly between the eyes; and when the animal is not employed in &s;eeking its
nouri&s;hment, it is rolled up, like a curl. A butterfly, when it is feeding,
flies round &s;ome flower, and &s;ettles upon it. <PB N="38" REF="38"> The
trunk is then uncurled, and thru&s;t out either wholly or in part; and is
employed in &s;earching the flower to its very bottom, let it be never &s;o
deep. This &s;earch being repeated &s;even or eight times, the butterfly then
pa&s;&s;es to another; and continues to hover over tho&s;e agreeable to its
ta&s;te, like a bird over its prey. This trunk con&s;i&s;ts of two equal hollow
tubes, nicely joined to each other, like the pipes of an organ.</P>
<P>Such is the figure and conformation of the&s;e beautiful
in&s;ects, that cheer our walks, and give us the earlie&s;t intimations of
&s;ummer. But it is not by day alone that they are &s;een fluttering wantonly
from flower to flower, as the greate&s;t number of them fly by night, and
ex|pand the mo&s;t beautiful colouring, at tho&s;e hours when there is no
&s;pectator. This tribe of in&s;ects has therefore been divided into Di|urnal
and Nocturnal Flies; or, more properly &s;peaking, into Butterflies and Moths:
the one only flying by day, the other mo&s;t u&s;ually on the wing in the
night. They may be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other, by their horns
or feelers: tho&s;e of the butterfly being clubbed, or knobbed at the end;
tho&s;e of the moth, tapering finer and finer to a point. To expre&s;s it
technically&mdash;the feelers of butterflies are cla|vated; tho&s;e of moths,
are filiform.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="39">The butterflies, as well as the moths,
employ the &s;hort life a&s;&s;igned them, in a variety of en|joyments. Their
whole time is &s;pent either in que&s;t of food, which every flower offers; or
in pur&s;uit of the female, who&s;e approach they can often perceive at above
two miles di&s;tance. Their &s;agacity in this particular is not le&s;s
a&s;to|ni&s;hing than true; but by what &s;en&s;e they are thus capable of
di&s;tingui&s;hing each other at &s;uch di&s;tances, is not ea&s;y to conceive.
It cannot be by the &s;ight, &s;ince &s;uch &s;mall objects as they are mu&s;t
be utterly imperceptible, at half the di&s;tance at which they perceive each
other: it can &s;carcely be by the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling, &s;ince the animal
has no organs for that purpo&s;e. Whatever be their powers of perception,
certain it is, that the male, after having fluttered, as if carele&s;ly, about
for &s;ome time, is &s;een to take wing, and go forward, &s;ometimes for two
miles together, in a direct line to where the female is perched on a
flower.</P>
<P>The general rule among in&s;ects is, that the female is larger
than the male; and this obtains particularly in the tribe I am de&s;cribing.
The body of the male is &s;maller and &s;lenderer; that of the female, more
thick and oval. Previous to the junction of the&s;e animals, they are &s;een
&s;porting in the air, pur&s;uing and flying from <PB N="40" REF="40"> each
other, and preparing, by a mock combat, for the more important bu&s;ine&s;s of
their lives. If they be di&s;turbed while united, the female flies off with the
male on her back, who &s;eems entirely pa&s;&s;ive upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But the females of many moths and butterflies &s;eem to have
a&s;&s;umed their airy form for no other rea&s;on but to fecundate their eggs,
and lay them. They are not &s;een fluttering about in que&s;t of food, or a
mate: all that pa&s;&s;es, during their &s;hort lives, is a junction with the
male of about half an hour; after which they depo&s;ite their eggs, and die,
without taking any nouri&s;hment, or &s;eeking any. It may be ob|&s;erved,
however, that in all the females of this tribe, they are impregnated by the
male by one aperture, and lay their eggs by another.</P>
<P>The eggs of female butterflies are di&s;po&s;ed in the body like
a bed of chaplets; which, when excluded, are u&s;ually oval, and of a whiti&s;h
colour: &s;ome, however, are quite round; and others flatted, like a turnip.
The covering or &s;hell of the egg, though &s;olid, is thin and tran&s;|parent;
and in proportion as the caterpillar grows within the egg, the colours change,
and are di&s;tributed differently. The butterfly &s;eems very well in&s;tructed
by nature in its choice of the plant, or the leaf, where it &s;hall depo&s;ite
its <PB N="41" REF="41"> burthen. Each egg contains but one caterpillar; and it
is requi&s;ite that this little animal, when excluded, &s;hould be near its
peculiar provi&s;ion. The butterfly, therefore, is careful to place her brood
only upon tho&s;e plants that afford good nouri&s;hment to its po&s;terity.
Though the little winged animal has been fed it&s;elf upon dew, or the honey of
flowers, yet it makes choice for its young of a very different provi&s;ion, and
lays its eggs on the mo&s;t un&s;avoury plants; the rag|weed, the cabbage, or
the nettle. Thus every butterfly chu&s;es not the plant mo&s;t grateful to it
in its winged &s;tate; but &s;uch as it has fed upon in its reptile form.</P>
<P>All the eggs of butterflies are attached to the leaves of the
favourite plant, by a &s;ort of &s;ize or glue; where they continue,
unob&s;erved, unle&s;s carefully &s;ought after. The eggs are &s;ometimes
placed round the tender &s;hoots of plants, in the form of bracelets,
con&s;i&s;ting of above two hundred in each, and generally &s;urrounding the
&s;hoot, like a ring upon a finger. Some butterflies &s;ecure their eggs from
the injuries of air, by covering them with hair, plucked from their own bodies,
as birds &s;ometimes are &s;een to make their ne&s;ts; &s;o that their eggs are
thus kept warm, and al&s;o entirely concealed.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="42">All the tribe of female moths lay their eggs
a &s;hort time after they leave the aurelia; but there are many butterflies
that flutter about the whole &s;ummer, and do not think of laying, till the
winter begins to warn them of their ap|proaching end: &s;ome even continue the
whole winter in the hollows of trees, and do not pro|vide for po&s;terity until
the beginning of April, when they leave their retreats, depo&s;ite their eggs,
and die. Their eggs &s;oon begin to feel the genial influence of the
&s;ea&s;on: the little animals bur&s;t from them in their caterpillar &s;tate,
to become aurelias, and butterflies in their turn; and thus to continue the
round of nature.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Enemies of the Caterpillar.</HEAD>
<P>NATURE, though it has rendered &s;ome animals &s;urprizingly
fruitful, yet ever takes care to prevent their too great encrea&s;e. One &s;et
of creatures is generally oppo&s;ed to another: and tho&s;e are chiefly the
mo&s;t prolific, that are, from their imbecility, incapable of making any
effectual defence. The caterpillar has perhaps, of all other animals, the
greate&s;t number of enemies; and &s;eems only to exi&s;t, by its &s;ur|prizing
fecundity. Some animals devour them by hundreds; others, more minute, yet more
dangerous, mangle them in various ways: &s;o that, how great &s;oever their
numbers may be, their de&s;troyers are in equal proportion. In|deed, if we
con&s;ider the mi&s;chiefs the&s;e reptiles are capable of occa&s;ioning, and
the various da|mages we &s;u&s;tain from their in&s;atiable rapacity, it is
happy for the other ranks of nature, that there are thou&s;ands of fi&s;hes,
birds, and even in&s;ects, that live chiefly upon caterpillars, and make them
their mo&s;t favourite repa&s;t.</P>
<P>When we de&s;cribed the little birds that live in our gardens,
and near our hou&s;es, as de|&s;tructive <PB N="44" REF="44"> neighbours,
&s;ufficient attention was not paid to the &s;ervices which they are
fre|quently found to render us. It has been proved, that a &s;ingle &s;parrow
and its mate, that have young ones, de&s;troy above three thou&s;and
ca|terpillars in a week; not to mention &s;everal butterflies, in which
numberle&s;s caterpillars are de&s;troyed in embryo. It is in pur&s;uit of
the&s;e reptiles that we are favoured with the vi&s;its of many of our mo&s;t
beautiful &s;ong&s;ters; that amu&s;e us during their continuance, and leave us
when the caterpillars di&s;appear.</P>
<P>The maxim which has often been urged again&s;t man, that he, of
all other animals, is the only creature that is an enemy to his own kind, and
that the human &s;pecies only are found to de&s;troy each other, has been
adopted, by per&s;ons who never con&s;idered the hi&s;tory of in&s;ects. Some
of the caterpillar kind in par|ticular, that &s;eem fitted only to live upon
leaves and plants, will, however, eat each other; and the &s;tronge&s;t will
devour the weak, in pre|ference to their vegetable food. That which lives upon
the oak, is found to &s;eize any of its companions, which it conveniently can,
by the fir&s;t rings, and inflict a deadly wound: it then fea&s;ts in
tranquillity on its prey, and leaves no|thing of the animal but the hu&s;k.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="45">But it is not from each other they have
mo&s;t to fear, as in general they are inoffen&s;ive; and many of this tribe
are found to live in a kind of &s;ociety. Many kinds of flies lay their eggs
either upon, or within their bodies; and as the&s;e turn into worms, the
caterpillar is &s;een to nouri&s;h a &s;et of inte&s;tine enemies within its
body, that mu&s;t &s;hortly be its de&s;truction: Nature having taught flies,
as well as all other animals, the &s;ure&s;t methods of perpetuating their
kind. 
<Q REND="inline">"Towards the end of Augu&s;t," &s;ays Reaumur,
"I perceived a little fly, of a beautiful gold colour, bu&s;ily employed in the
body of a large caterpillar, of that kind which feeds upon cabbage. I gently
&s;eparated that part of the leaf on which the&s;e in&s;ects were placed, from
the re&s;t of the plant, and placed it where I might ob&s;erve them more at my
ea&s;e. The fly, wholly taken up by the bu&s;ine&s;s in which it was employed,
walked along the cater|pillar's body, now and then remaining fixed to a
particular &s;pot. Upon this occa&s;ion, I perceived it every now and then dart
a &s;ting, which it carried at the end of its tail, into the caterpillar's
body, and then drew it out again, to repeat the &s;ame operation in another
place. It was not difficult for me to conjecture the bu&s;ine&s;s which engaged
this animal &s;o ear|ne&s;tly; <PB N="46" REF="46"> its whole aim was to
depo&s;ite its eggs in the caterpillar's body; which was to &s;erve as a proper
retreat for bringing them to per|fection. The reptile thus rudely treated,
&s;eemed to bear all very patiently, only mov|ing a little when &s;tung too
deeply; which, however, the fly &s;eemed entirely to di&s;regard. I took
particular care to feed this caterpillar; which &s;eemed to me to continue as
voracious and vigorous as any of the re&s;t of its kind. In about ten or twelve
days, it changed into an aurelia, which &s;eemed gradually to decline, and
died: upon examining its internal parts, the animal was entirely devoured by
worms; which, however, did not come to perfection, as it is probable they had
not enough to &s;u&s;tain them within."</Q></P>
<P>What the French philo&s;opher perceived upon this occa&s;ion, is
every day to be &s;een in &s;everal of the larger kinds of caterpillars,
who&s;e bodies &s;erve as a ne&s;t to various flies, that very carefully
depo&s;ite their eggs within them. The large cabbage caterpillar is &s;o
&s;ubject to its injuries, that, at certain &s;ea&s;ons, it is much ea&s;ier to
find them with than without them. The ichnumon fly, as it is called,
particularly infe&s;ts the&s;e rep|tiles, and prevents their fecundity. This
fly is, of all others, the mo&s;t formidable to in&s;ects of 
<PB N="47" REF="47"> various kinds. The &s;pider, that de&s;troys the ant, the
moth, and the butterfly, yet often falls a prey to the ichnumon; who pur&s;ues
the robber to his retreat, and, de&s;pi&s;ing his nets, tears him in pieces, in
the very labyrinth he has made. This in&s;ect, as redoubtable as the little
quadru|pede that de&s;troys the crocodile, has received the &s;ame name; and
from its de&s;truction of the caterpillar tribe, is probably more &s;erviceable
to mankind. This in&s;ect, I &s;ay, makes the body of the caterpillar the place
for depo&s;iting its eggs; to the number of ten, fifteen, or twenty. As they
are laid in tho&s;e parts which are not mortal, the reptile &s;till continues
to live, and to feed, &s;hewing no &s;igns of being incommoded by its new
gue&s;ts. The caterpillar changes its &s;kin; and &s;ometimes undergoes the
great change into an aurelia: but &s;till the fatal intruders work within, and
&s;ecretly devour its internal &s;ub|&s;tance: &s;oon after they are &s;een
bur&s;ting through its &s;kin, and moving away, in order to &s;pin
them|&s;elves a covering, previous to their own little transformation. It is
indeed a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ome|times to &s;ee the number of worms, and tho&s;e
pretty large, that thus i&s;&s;ue from the body of a &s;ingle caterpillar, and
eat their way through its &s;kin: but it is more extraordinary &s;till, that
they &s;hould remain within the body, devouring its <PB N="48" REF="48">
entrails, without de&s;troying its life. The truth is, they &s;eem in&s;tructed
by nature not to devour its vital parts; for they are found to feed only upon
that fatty &s;ub&s;tance which compo&s;es the large&s;t part of the
caterpillar's body. When this &s;urprizing appearance was fir&s;t ob&s;erved,
it was &s;uppo&s;ed that the animal thus gave birth to a number of flies,
different from it&s;elf; and that the &s;ame caterpillar &s;ometimes bred an
ichnumon, and &s;ometimes a butterfly: but it was not till after more careful
in&s;pection, it was di&s;covered, that the ichnumon tribe were not the
caterpillar's offspring, but its murderers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Silkworm.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING mentioned, in the la&s;t chapter, the damages inflicted
by the caterpillar tribe, we now come to an animal of this kind, that alone
compen&s;ates for all the mi&s;chief occa&s;ioned by the re&s;t. This little
creature, which only works for it&s;elf, has been made of the utmo&s;t
&s;ervice to man; and furni&s;hes him with a covering more beautiful than any
other animal can &s;upply. We may declaim indeed again&s;t the luxuries of the
times, when &s;ilk is &s;o generally worn; but were &s;uch garments to fail,
what other arts could &s;upply their deficiency?</P>
<P>Though &s;ilk was anciently brought in &s;mall quantities to
Rome, yet it was &s;o &s;carce as to be &s;old for its weight in gold; and was
con&s;idered as &s;uch a luxurious refinement in dre&s;s, that it was infamous
for a man to appear in habits of which &s;ilk formed but half the
compo&s;ition. It was mo&s;t probably brought among them from the remote&s;t
parts of the ea&s;t; &s;ince it was, at the time of which I am &s;peaking,
&s;carcely known even in Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more remote from the truth, <PB N="50" REF="50">
than the manner in which their hi&s;torians de&s;cribe the animal by which
&s;ilk is produced. Pau&s;anias informs us, that &s;ilk came from the country
of the Seres, a people of A&s;iatic Scy|thia; in which place an in&s;ect, as
large as the beetle, but in every other re&s;pect re&s;embling a &s;pider, was
bred up for that purpo&s;e. They take great care, as he a&s;&s;ures us, to feed
and defend it from the weather; as well during the &s;ummer's heat, as the
rigours of winter. This in&s;ect, he ob&s;erves, makes its web with its feet,
of which it has eight in number. It is fed, for the &s;pace of four years, upon
a kind of pa&s;te, prepared for it; and at the beginning of the fifth, it is
&s;upplied with the leaves of the green willow, of which it is particularly
fond. It then feeds till it bur&s;ts with fat; after which they take out its
bowels, which are &s;pun into the beautiful manufacture &s;o &s;carce and
co&s;tly.</P>
<P>The real hi&s;tory of this animal was unknown among the Romans
till the times of Ju&s;tinian; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;ilkworms were
not brought into Europe till the beginning of the twelfth century; when Roger
of Sicily, brought workmen in this manufacture from A&s;ia Minor, after his
return from his expedition to the Holy Land, and &s;ettled them in Sicily and
Calabria. From the&s;e the other kingdoms of Europe <PB N="51" REF="51">
learned this manufacture; and it is now one of the mo&s;t lucrative carried on
among the &s;outhern provinces of Europe.</P>
<P>The &s;ilkworm is now very well known to be a large caterpillar,
of a whiti&s;h colour, with twelve feet, and producing a butterfly of the moth
kind. The cone on which it &s;pins, is formed for covering it while it
continues in the aurelia &s;tate; and &s;everal of the&s;e, properly wound off,
and united together, form tho&s;e &s;trong and beautiful threads, which is
woven into &s;ilk. The feeding the&s;e worms, the gathering, the winding, the
twi&s;ting, and the weaving their &s;ilk, is one of the principal manufactures
of Europe; and, as our luxuries encrea&s;e, &s;eems every day to become more
and more nece&s;&s;ary to human happine&s;s.</P>
<P>There are two methods of breeding &s;ilk|worms; for they may be
left to grow, and re|main at liberty upon the trees where they are hatched; or
they may be kept in a place built for that purpo&s;e, and fed every day with
fre&s;h leaves. The fir&s;t method is u&s;ed in China, Tonquin, and other hot
countries; the other is u&s;ed in tho&s;e places where the animal has been
artificially propagated, and &s;till continues a &s;tranger. In the warm
climates, the &s;ilkworm proceeds from an egg, which has been glued 
<PB N="52" REF="52"> by the parent moth upon proper parts of the mulberry-tree,
and which remains in that &s;itua|tion during the winter. The manner in which
they are &s;ituated and fixed to the tree, keeps them unaffected by the
influence of the wea|ther; &s;o that tho&s;e fro&s;ts which are &s;evere enough
to kill the tree, have no power to injure the &s;ilkworm.</P>
<P>The in&s;ect never proceeds from the egg till Nature has
provided it a &s;ufficient &s;upply; and till the budding leaves are
furni&s;hed, in &s;uffi|cient abundance, for its &s;upport. When the leaves are
put forth, the worms &s;eem to feel the genial &s;ummons, and bur&s;ting from
their little eggs, crawl upon the leaves, where they feed with a mo&s;t
voracious appetite. Thus they become larger by degrees; and after &s;ome months
feeding, they lay, upon every leaf, &s;mall bundles, or cones of &s;ilk, which
appear like &s;o many golden apples, painted on a fine green ground. Such is
the method of breeding them in the Ea&s;t; and without doubt it is be&s;t for
the worms, and lea&s;t trouble&s;ome for the feeder of them. But it is
otherwi&s;e in our colder European climates; the frequent changes of the
weather, and the heavy dews of our even|ings, render the keeping them all night
expo&s;ed, &s;ubject to &s;o many inconveniences, as to admit 
<PB N="53" REF="53"> of no remedy, It is true, that by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
nets, they may be pre&s;erved from the in&s;ults of birds; but the &s;evere
cold weather, which often &s;ucceeds the fir&s;t heats of &s;ummer, as well as
the rain and high winds, will de&s;troy them all: and, therefore, to breed them
in Europe, they mu&s;t be &s;heltered and protected from every external
injury.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, a room is cho&s;en, with a &s;outh a&s;pect;
and the windows are &s;o well glazed, as not to admit the lea&s;t air: the
walls are well built, and the planks of the floor ex|ceeding clo&s;e, &s;o as
to admit neither birds nor mice, nor even &s;o much as an in&s;ect. In the
middle there &s;hould be four pillars erected, or four wooden po&s;ts, &s;o
placed as to form a pretty large &s;quare. Between the&s;e are different
&s;tories made with ozier hurdles; and under each hur|dle there &s;hould be a
floor, with an upright bor|der all round. The&s;e hurdles and floors mu&s;t
hang upon pullies, &s;o as to be placed, or taken down at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>When the worms are hatched, &s;ome tender mulberry leaves are
provided, and placed in the cloth or paper box in which the eggs were laid, and
which are large enough to hold a great number. When they have acquired &s;ome
&s;trength, they mu&s;t be di&s;tributed on beds of <PB N="54" REF="54">
mulberry leaves, in the different &s;tories of the &s;quare in the middle of
the room, round which a per&s;on may freely pa&s;s on every &s;ide. They will
fix them&s;elves to the leaves, and afterwards to the &s;ticks of the hurdles,
when the leaves are devoured. They have then a thread, by which they can
&s;u&s;pend them&s;elves on occa&s;ion, to pre|vent any &s;hock by a fall; but
this is by no means to be con&s;idered as the &s;ilk which they &s;pin
afterwards in &s;uch abundance. Care mu&s;t be taken that fre&s;h leaves be
brought every morning, which mu&s;t be &s;trewed very gently and equally over
them; upon which the &s;ilk|worms will for&s;ake the remainder of the old
leaves, which mu&s;t be carefully taken away, and every thing kept very clean;
for nothing hurts the&s;e in&s;ects &s;o much as moi&s;ture and
unclean|line&s;s. For this rea&s;on their leaves mu&s;t be gathered when the
weather is dry, and kept in a dry place, if it be nece&s;&s;ary to lay in a
&s;tore. As the&s;e animals have but a &s;hort time to live, they make u&s;e of
every moment, and almo&s;t continually are &s;pinning, except at tho&s;e
in|tervals when they change their &s;kins. If mul|berry leaves be difficult to
be obtained, the leaves of lettuce or holyoak will &s;u&s;tain them: but they
do not thrive &s;o well upon their new diet; and their &s;ilk will neither be
&s;o copious, nor of &s;o good a quality.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="55">Though the judicious choice, and careful
management of their diet, is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, yet there is another
precaution of equal importance, which is to give them air, and open their
chamber windows, at &s;uch times as the &s;un &s;hines warme&s;t. The place
al&s;o mu&s;t be kept as clean as po&s;&s;ible; not only the &s;everal floors
that are laid to receive their ordure, but the whole apartments in general.
The&s;e things well ob&s;erved, contribute greatly to their health and
encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>The worm, at the the time it bur&s;ts the &s;hell, is extremely
&s;mall, and of a black colour; but the head is of a more &s;hining black than
the re&s;t of the body: &s;ome days after, they begin to turn whiti&s;h, or of
an a&s;h-coloured grey. After the &s;kin begins to grow too rigid, or he animal
is &s;tinted within it, the in&s;ect throws it off, and appears cloathed a-new:
it then be|comes larger and much whiter, though it has a greeni&s;h ca&s;t:
after &s;ome days, which are more or le&s;s, according to the different heat of
the climate, or to the quality of the food, it leaves off eating, and &s;eems
to &s;leep for two days together: then it begins to &s;tir, and put it&s;elf
into violent motions, till the &s;kin falls off the &s;econd time, and is
thrown a&s;ide by the animal's feet. All the&s;e changes are made in three
weeks <PB N="58" REF="56"> may ea&s;ily be ob&s;erved is, that it is compo&s;ed
externally of a kind of rough cotton-like &s;ub|&s;tance, which is called
flo&s;s; within the thread is more di&s;tinct and even; and next the body of
the aurelia, the apartment &s;eems lined with a &s;ub&s;tance of the hardne&s;s
of paper, but of a much &s;tronger con&s;i&s;tence. It mu&s;t not be
&s;up|po&s;ed, that the thread which goes to compo&s;e the cone, is rolled
round, as we roll a bottom; on the contrary, it lies upon it in a very
irre|gular manner, and winds off now from one &s;ide of the cone, and then from
the other. This whole thread, if mea&s;ured, will be found about three hundred
yards long; and &s;o very fine, that eight or ten of them are generally rolled
off into one by the manufacturers. The cone, when completed, is in form like a
pidgeon's egg, and more pointed at one end than the other; at the &s;maller
end, the head of the aurelia is generally found; and this is the place that the
in&s;ect, when converted into a moth, is generally &s;een to bur&s;t
through.</P>
<P>It is generally a fortnight or three weeks before the aurelia is
changed into a moth; but no &s;ooner is the winged in&s;ect completely formed,
than having dive&s;ted it&s;elf of its aurelia &s;kin, it prepares to bur&s;t
through its cone, or outward pri&s;on: for this purpo&s;e it extends its 
<PB N="59" REF="57"> head towards the point of the cone, butts with its eyes,
which are rough, again&s;t the lining of its cell, wears it away, and at la&s;t
pu&s;hes for|ward, through a pa&s;&s;age which is &s;mall at fir&s;t, but which
enlarges as the animal encrea&s;es its efforts for emancipation; while the
tattered rem|nants of its aurelia &s;kin lie in confu&s;ion within the cone,
like a bundle of dirty linen.</P>
<P>The animal, when thus &s;et free from its double confinement,
appears exhau&s;ted with fatigue, and &s;eems produced for no other pur|po&s;e
but to tran&s;mit a future brood. It neither flies nor eats; the male only
&s;eeking the female, who&s;e eggs he impregnates; and their union continues
for four days, without interruption. The male dies immediately after
&s;eparation from his mate; and &s;he &s;urvives him only till &s;he has laid
her eggs, which are not hatched into worms till the en&s;uing &s;pring.</P>
<P>However, there are few of the&s;e animals &s;uf|fered to come to
a &s;tate of maturity; for as their bur&s;ting through the cone de&s;troys the
&s;ilk, the manufacturers take care to kill the aurelia, by expo&s;ing it to
the &s;un, before the moth comes to perfection. This done, they take off the
flo&s;s, and throw the cones into warm water, &s;tirring them till the fir&s;t
thread offers them a clue for winding all off. They generally take eight of 
<PB N="60" REF="58"> the &s;ilken threads together; the cones &s;till kept
under water, till a proper quantity of the &s;ilk is wound off: however, they
do not take all; for the latter parts grow weak, and are of a bad colour. As to
the paper-like &s;ub&s;tance which remains, &s;ome &s;tain it with a variety of
colours, to make artificial flowers; others let it lie in the water, till the
glutinous matter which cements it is all di&s;&s;olved: it is then carded like
wool, &s;pun with a wheel, and converted into &s;ilk &s;tuffs of an inferior
kind.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Fourth Order of In&s;ects.</HEAD>
<P>IN the foregoing part we treated of cater|pillars changing into
butterflies; in the pre&s;ent will be given the hi&s;tory of grubs changing
into their corre&s;ponding winged animals. The&s;e, like the former, undergo
their transformation, and appear as grubs or maggots, as aurelias, and at
la&s;t as winged in&s;ects. Like the former, they are bred from eggs; they feed
in their reptile &s;tate; they continue motionle&s;s and lifele&s;s, as
aurelias; and fly and propagate, when furni&s;hed with wings. But they differ
in many re&s;pects: the grub or maggot wants the number of feet which the
caterpillar is &s;een to have; the aurelia is not &s;o totally wrapped up, but
that its feet and its wings appear. The perfect animal, when emancipated,
al&s;o has its wings either ca&s;ed, or tran&s;parent, like gauze; not coloured
with that beautifully painted du&s;t which adorns the wings of the
butterfly.</P>
<P>In this cla&s;s of in&s;ects, therefore, we may place a various
tribe, that are fir&s;t laid as eggs, then are excluded as maggots or grubs,
then change <PB N="64" REF="61"> into aurelias, with their legs and wings not
wrapped up, but appearing; and la&s;tly, a&s;&s;um|ing wings, in which &s;tate
they propagate their kind. Some of the&s;e have four tran&s;parent wings, as
bees; &s;ome have two membranous ca&s;es to their wings, as beetles; and &s;ome
have but two wings, which are tran&s;parent, as ants. Here, therefore, we will
place the bee, the wa&s;p, the humble bee, the ichnumon fly, the gnat, the
tipula or longlegs, the bettle, the may-bug, the glow-worm, and the ant. The
transformations which all the&s;e undergo, are pretty nearly &s;imilar; and
though very different animals in form, are yet produced nearly in the &s;ame
manner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Bee.</HEAD>
<P>TO give a complete hi&s;tory of this in&s;ect in a few pages,
which &s;ome have exhau&s;ted vo|lumes in de&s;cribing, and who&s;e nature and
pro|perties &s;till continue in di&s;pute, is impo&s;&s;ible. It will be
&s;ufficient to give a general idea of the animal's operations; which, though
they have been &s;tudied for more than two thou&s;and years, are &s;till but
incompletely known. The account given us by Reaumur is &s;ufficiently minute;
and, if true, &s;ufficiently wonderful: but I find many of the facts which he
relates, doubted by tho&s;e who are mo&s;t conver&s;ant with bees; and &s;ome
of them actually declared not to have a real exi&s;tence in nature.</P>
<P>It is unhappy, therefore, for tho&s;e who&s;e me|thod demands an
hi&s;tory of bees, that they are unfurni&s;hed with tho&s;e materials which
have in|duced &s;o many ob&s;ervers to contradict &s;o great a naturali&s;t.
His life was &s;pent in the contem|plation; and it requires an equal &s;hare of
at|tention, to prove the error of his di&s;coveries. Without entering,
therefore, into the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">pute, I will
take him for my guide; and ju&s;t mention, <PB N="66" REF="63"> as I go along,
tho&s;e particulars in which &s;uc|ceeding ob&s;ervers have begun to think him
er|roneous. Which of the two are right, time only can di&s;cover; for my part I
have only heard one &s;ide, for as yet none have been &s;o bold as openly to
oppo&s;e Reaumur's delightful re&s;earches.</P>
<P>There are three different kinds of bees in every hive. Fir&s;t,
the labouring bees, which make up the far greate&s;t number, and are thought to
be neither male or female, but merely born for the purpo&s;es of labour, and
continuing the breed, by &s;upplying the young with provi&s;ion, while yet in
their helple&s;s &s;tate. The &s;econd &s;ort are the drones; they are of a
darker colour, longer, and more thick by one third than the former: they are
&s;uppo&s;ed to be the males; and there is not above a hundred of them, in a
hive of &s;even or eight thou&s;and bees. The third &s;ort is much larger than
either of the former, and &s;till fewer in number: &s;ome a&s;&s;ert, that
there is not above one in every &s;warm; but this later ob&s;ervers affirm not
to be true, there being &s;ometimes five or &s;ix in the &s;ame hive. The&s;e
are called queen bees, and are &s;aid to lay all the eggs from which the whole
&s;warm is hatched in a &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>In examining the &s;tructure of the common working bee, the
fir&s;t remarkable part that <PB N="67" REF="64"> offers is the trunk, which
&s;erves to extract the honey from flowers. It is not formed, like that of
other flies, in the manner of a tube, by which the fluid is to be &s;ucked up;
but like a be&s;om, to &s;weep, or a tongue, to lick it away. The animal is
furni&s;hed al&s;o with teeth, which &s;erve it in making wax. This
&s;ub&s;tance is gathered from flowers, like honey; it con&s;i&s;ts of that
du&s;t or farina which contribute to the fecundation of plants, and is molded
into wax by the little animal, at lei&s;ure. Every bee, when it leaves the hive
to collect this precious &s;tore, enters into the cup of the flower,
particularly &s;uch as &s;eem charged with the greate&s;t quantities of this
yellow farina. As the animal's body is covered over with hair, it rolls
it&s;elf within the flower, and &s;oon becomes quite covered with the du&s;t,
which it &s;oon after bru&s;hes off with its two hind legs, and kneads into two
little balls. In the thighs of the hind legs there are two cavities, edged with
hair; and into the&s;e, as into a ba&s;ket, the animal &s;ticks its pellets.
Thus employed, the bee flies from flower to flower, encrea&s;ing its &s;tore,
and adding to its &s;tock of wax; until the ball, upon each thigh, becomes as
big as a grain of pepper: by this time, having got a &s;ufficient load, it
returns, making the be&s;t of its way to the hive.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="65">The belly of the bee is divided into &s;ix
rings, which &s;ometime &s;horten the body, by &s;lipping one over the other.
It contains within it, be&s;ide the inte&s;tines, the honey-bag, the venom-bag,
and the &s;ting. The honey-bag is as tran&s;parent as chry&s;tal, containing
the honey that the bee has bru&s;hed from the flowers; of which the greater
part is carried to the hive, and poured into the cells of the honey-comb; while
the re|mainder &s;erves for the bee's own nouri&s;hment: for, during &s;ummer,
it never touches what has been laid up for the winter. The &s;ting, which
&s;erves to defend this little animal from its enemies, is compo&s;ed of three
parts; the &s;heath, and two darts, which are extremely &s;mall and
penetrating. Both the darts have &s;everal &s;mall points or barbs, like
tho&s;e of a fi&s;h-hook, which renders the &s;ting more painful, and makes the
darts rankle in the wound. Still, however, this in&s;trument would be very
&s;light, did not the bee poi&s;on the wound. The &s;heath, which has a &s;harp
point, makes the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion; which is followed by that of the
darts, and then the venomous liquor is poured in. The &s;heath &s;ometimes
&s;ticks &s;o fa&s;t in the wound, that the animal is obliged to leave it
behind; by which the bee &s;oon after dies, and the wound is con|&s;iderably
enflamed. It might at fir&s;t appear <PB N="69" REF="66"> well for mankind, if
the bee were without its &s;ting; but, upon recollection, it will be found,
that the little animal would then have too many rivals in &s;haring its
labours. An hundred other lazy animals, fond of honey, and hating la|bour,
would intrude upon the &s;weets of the hive; and the trea&s;ure would be
carried off, for want of armed guardians to protect it.</P>
<P>From examining the bee &s;ingly, we now come to con&s;ider it in
&s;ociety, as an animal not only &s;ubject to laws, but active, vigilant,
laborious, and di&s;intere&s;ted. All its provi&s;ions are laid up for the
community; and all its arts in building a cell, de&s;igned for the benefit of
po&s;terity. The &s;ub&s;tance with which bees build their cells is wax; which
is fa&s;hioned into convenient apart|ments for them&s;elves and their young.
When they begin to work in their hives, they divide them&s;elves into four
companies: one of which roves in the fields in &s;earch of materials; another
employs it&s;elf in laying out the bottom and par|titions of their cells; a
third is employed in making the in&s;ide &s;mooth from the corners and angles;
and the fourth company bring food for the re&s;t, or relieve tho&s;e who return
with their re&s;pective burthens. But they are not kept con&s;tant to one
employment; they often change the ta&s;ks a&s;&s;igned them: tho&s;e that have
been <PB N="70" REF="67"> at work, being permitted to go abroad; and tho&s;e
that have been in the fields already, take their places. They &s;eem even to
have &s;igns, by which they under&s;tand each other; for when any of them want
food, it bends down its trunk to the bee from whom it is expected, which then
opens its honey-bag, and lets &s;ome drops fall into the other's mouth, which
is at that time opened to receive it. Their diligence and labour is &s;o great,
that, in a day's time, they are able to make cells, which lie upon each other
numerous enough to contain three thou&s;and bees.</P>
<P>If we examine their cells, they will be found formed in the
exacte&s;t proportion. It was &s;aid by Pappus, an ancient geometrician, that,
of all other figures, hexagons were the mo&s;t con|venient; for, when placed
touching each other, the mo&s;t convenient room would be given, and the
&s;malle&s;t lo&s;t. The cells of the bees are per|fect hexagons: the&s;e, in
every honeycomb, are double, opening on either &s;ide, and clo&s;ed at the
bottom. The bottoms are compo&s;ed of little triangular panes, which, when
united together, terminate in a point, and lie exactly upon the extremities of
other panes of the &s;ame &s;hape, in oppo&s;ite cells. The&s;e lodgings have
&s;paces, like &s;treets, between them, large enough to give the 
<PB N="71" REF="68"> bees a free pa&s;&s;age in and out; and yet narrow enough
to pre&s;erve the nece&s;&s;ary heat. The mouth of every cell is defended by a
border, which makes the door a little le&s;s than the in&s;ide of the cell,
which &s;erves to &s;trengthen the whole. The&s;e cells &s;erve for different
pur|po&s;es: for laying up their young; for their wax, which in winter becomes
a part of their food; and for their honey, which makes their principal
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>It is well known that the habitation of bees ought to be very
clo&s;e; and what their hives want, from the negligence or un&s;kilfulne&s;s of
man, the&s;e animals &s;upply by their own indu&s;try: &s;o that it is their
principal care, when fir&s;t hived, to &s;top up all the crannies. For this
purpo&s;e they make u&s;e of a re&s;inous gum, which is more tenacious than
wax, and differs greatly from it. This the ancients called Propolis: it will
grow con&s;iderably hard in June; though it will in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;often
by heat; and is often found different in con&s;i&s;tence, colour and &s;mell.
It has generally an agreeable aromatic odour when it is warmed; and by &s;ome
it is con&s;idered as a mo&s;t grateful perfume. When the bees begin to work
with it, it is &s;oft, but it acquires a firmer con&s;i&s;tence every day; till
at length it a&s;&s;umes a brown colour, and becomes much <PB N="72" REF="69">
harder than wax. The bees carry it on their hinder legs; and &s;ome think it is
met with on the birch, the willow, and poplar. However it is procured, it is
certain that they plai&s;ter the in&s;ide of their hives with this
compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>If examined through a gla&s;s hive, from the hurry the whole
&s;warm is in, the whole at fir&s;t appears like anarchy and confu&s;ion: but
the &s;pectator &s;oon finds every animal diligently em|ployed, and following
one pur&s;uit, with a &s;et|tled purpo&s;e. Their teeth are the in&s;truments
by which they model and fa&s;hion their various buildings, and give them &s;uch
&s;ymmetry and perfection. They begin at the top of the hive; and &s;everal of
them work at a time, at the cells which have two faces. If they are &s;tinted
with regard to time, they give the new cells but half the depth which they
ought to have; leaving them imperfect, till they have &s;ketched out the number
of cells nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. The con&s;truction of
their combs, co&s;ts them a great deal of labour: they are made by
in&s;en|&s;ible additions; and not ca&s;t at once in a mold, as &s;ome are apt
to imagine. There &s;eems no end of their &s;haping, fini&s;hing, and turning
them neatly up. The cells for their young are mo&s;t carefully formed; tho&s;e
de&s;igned for lodging the drones, are larger than the re&s;t; 
<PB N="73" REF="70"> and that for the queen-bee, the large&s;t of all. The
cells in which the young brood are lodged, &s;erve at different times for
containing honey; and this proceeds from an obvious cau&s;e: every worm, before
it is transformed into an aurelia, hangs its old &s;kin on the partitions of
its cell; and thus, while it &s;trengthens the wall, dimi|ni&s;hes the capacity
of its late apartment. The &s;ame cell, in a &s;ingle &s;ummer, is often
tenanted by three or four worms in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and the next &s;ea&s;on,
by three or four more. Each worm takes particular care to fortify the pannels
of its cell, by hanging up its &s;poils there: thus, the partitions being
lined, &s;ix or eight deep, become at la&s;t too narrow for a new brood, and
are converted into &s;tore-hou&s;es, for honey.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e cells where nothing but honey is de|po&s;ited, are much
deeper than the re&s;t. When the harve&s;t of honey is &s;o plentiful that they
have not &s;ufficient room for it, they either lengthen their combs, or build
more; which are much longer than the former. Sometimes they work at three combs
at a time; for, when there are three work-hou&s;es, more bees may be thus
employed, without embarra&s;&s;ing each other.</P>
<P>But honey, as was before ob&s;erved, is not the only food upon
which the&s;e animals &s;ub&s;i&s;t. <PB N="74" REF="71"> The meal of flowers,
of which their wax is formed, is one of their mo&s;t favourite repa&s;ts. This
is a diet which they live upon during the &s;ummer; and of which they lay up a
large winter provi&s;ion. The wax of which their combs are made, is no more
than this meal dige&s;ted, and wrought into a pa&s;te. When the flowers upon
which bees generally feed, are not fully blown, and this meal or du&s;t is not
offered in &s;ufficient quantities, the bees pinch the tops of the &s;tamina in
which it is contained, with their teeth; and thus anticipate the progre&s;s of
vegetation. In April and May, the bees are bu&s;y, from morning to evening, in
gathering this meal; but when the weather becomes too hot in the mid&s;t of
&s;ummer, they work only in the morning.</P>
<P>The bee is furni&s;hed with a &s;tomach for its wax, as well as
its honey. In the former of the two, their powder is altered, dige&s;ted and
concocted into real wax; and is thus ejected by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age by which
it was &s;wallowed. Every comb, newly made, is white: but it be|comes yellow as
it grows old, and almo&s;t black when kept too long in the hive. Be&s;ide the
wax thus dige&s;ted, there is a large portion of the powder kneaded up for food
in every hive, and kept in &s;eparate cells, for winter provi&s;ion. 
<PB N="75" REF="72"> This is called, by the country people, bee-bread; and
contributes to the health and &s;trength of the animal during winter. Tho&s;e
who rear bees, may rob them of their honey, and feed them, during the winter,
with treacle; but no proper &s;ub&s;titute has yet been found for the
bee-bread; and, without it, the animals become con&s;umptive and die.</P>
<P>As for the honey, it is extracted from that part of the flower
called the nectareum. From the mouth this delicious fluid pa&s;&s;es into the
gullet; and then into the fir&s;t &s;tomach, or honey-bag, which, when filled,
appears like an oblong bladder. Children, that live in country places, are well
acquainted with this bladder; and de&s;troy many bees to come at their &s;tore
of honey. When a bee has &s;ufficiently filled its fir&s;t &s;tomach, it
returns back to the hive, where it di&s;gorges the honey into one of the cells.
It often happens that the bee delivers its &s;tore to &s;ome other, at the
mouth of the hive, and flies off for a fre&s;h &s;upply. Some honey-combs are
always left open for common u&s;e; but many others are &s;topped up, till there
is a nece&s;&s;ity of opening them. Each of the&s;e are covered care|fully with
wax; &s;o clo&s;e, that the covers &s;eem to be made at the very in&s;tant the
fluid is de|po&s;ited within them.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="73">Having thus given a cur&s;ory de&s;cription
of the in&s;ect, individually con&s;idered, and of the habitation it forms, we
next come to its &s;ocial habits and in&s;titutions: and, in con&s;idering this
little animal attentively, after the nece&s;&s;ary pre|cautions for the
immediate pre&s;ervation of the community, its &s;econd care is turned to the
continuance of po&s;terity. How numerous &s;oever the multitude of bees may
appear in one &s;warm, yet they all owe their original to a &s;ingle parent,
which is called the queen-bee. It is indeed &s;urprizing that a &s;ingle
in&s;ect &s;hall, in one &s;ummer, give birth to above twenty thou&s;and young:
but, upon opening her body, the wonder will cea&s;e; as the number of eggs
appearing, at one time, amounts to five thou&s;and. This animal, who&s;e
exi&s;tence is of &s;uch importance to her &s;ubjects, may ea&s;ily be
di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t, by her &s;ize, and the &s;hape of her body.
On her &s;afety depends the whole wel|fare of the commonwealth; and the
attentions paid her by all the re&s;t of the &s;warm, evidently &s;hew the
dependence her &s;ubjects have upon her &s;ecurity. If this in&s;ect be
carefully ob&s;erved, &s;he will be &s;een at times attended with a nu|merous
retinue, marching from cell to cell, plunging the extremity of her body into
many of them, and leaving a &s;mall egg in each.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="74">The bees which generally compo&s;e her
train, are thought to be males, which &s;erve to im|pregnate her by turns.
The&s;e are larger and blacker than the common bees; without &s;tings, and
without indu&s;try. They &s;eem formed only to tran&s;mit a po&s;terity; and to
attend the queen, whenever &s;he thinks proper to i&s;&s;ue from the &s;ecret
retreats of the hive, where &s;he mo&s;t u&s;ually re&s;ides. Upon the union of
the&s;e two kinds depends all expectations of a future pro|geny; for the
working bees are of no &s;ex, and only labour for another offspring: yet &s;uch
is their attention to their queen, that if &s;he hap|pens to die, they will
leave off working, and take no farther care of po&s;terity. If, however,
another queen is in this &s;tate of univer&s;al de&s;pair pre&s;ented them,
they immediately acknowledge her for &s;overeign, and once more diligently
ap|ply to their labour. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, how|ever, that all this
fertility of the queen-bee, and the great attentions paid to her by the re&s;t,
are controverted by more recent ob&s;ervers. They a&s;&s;ert, that the common
bees are parents them&s;elves; that they depo&s;ite their eggs in the cells
which they have prepared; that the females are impregnated by the males, and
bring forth a progeny, which is wholly their own.</P>
<P>However, to go on with their hi&s;tory, as <PB N="78" REF="75">
delivered us by Mr. Reaumur&mdash;When the queen-bee has depo&s;ited the number
of eggs nece&s;&s;ary in the cells, the working bees under|take the care of the
ri&s;ing po&s;terity. They are &s;een to leave off their u&s;ual employments;
to con&s;truct proper receptacles for eggs; or to complete tho&s;e that are
already formed. They purpo&s;ely build little cells, extremely &s;olid, for the
young; in which they employ a great deal of wax: tho&s;e de&s;igned for lodging
the males, as was already ob&s;erved, are larger than the re&s;t; and tho&s;e
for the queen-bees the large&s;t of all. There is u&s;ually but one egg
depo&s;ited in every cell; but when the fecundity of the queen is &s;uch, that
it exceeds the number of cells already pre|pared, there are &s;ometimes three
or four eggs crowded together in the &s;ame apartment. But this is an
inconvenience that the working bees will by no means &s;uffer. They &s;eem
&s;en&s;ible that, two young ones, &s;tuffed up in the &s;ame cell, when they
grow larger, will but embarra&s;s, and at la&s;t de&s;troy each other: they
therefore take care to leave a cell to every egg; and remove, or de&s;troy the
re&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ingle egg that is left remaining, is fixed to the bottom
of the cell, and touches it but in a &s;ingle point. A day or two after it is
depo|&s;ited, the worm is excluded from the &s;hell of <PB N="79" REF="76"> the
egg, having the appearance of a maggot rolled up in a ring, and lying &s;oftly
on a bed of a whiti&s;h coloured jelly; upon which al&s;o the little animal
begins to feed. In the mean time, the in&s;tant it appears, the working bees
attend it with the mo&s;t anxious and parental tenderne&s;s; they furni&s;h it
every hour with a &s;upply of this whiti&s;h &s;ub&s;tance, on which it feeds
and lies; and watch the cell with unre|mitting care. They are nur&s;es that
have a greater affection for the offspring of others, than many parents have
for their own children. They are con&s;tant in vi&s;iting each cell, and
&s;eeing that nothing is wanting; preparing the white mixture, which is nothing
but a compo|&s;ition of honey and wax, in their own bowels, with which they
feed them. Thus attended, and plentifully fed, the worm, in le&s;s than &s;ix
days time, comes to its full growth, and no longer accepts the food offered it.
When the bees perceive that it has no further occa&s;ion for feeding, they
perform the la&s;t offices of ten|derne&s;s, and &s;hut the little animal up in
its cell; walling up the mouth of its apartment with wax: there they leave the
worm to it&s;elf; having &s;ecured it from every external injury.</P>
<P>The worm is no &s;ooner left enclo&s;ed, but, from a &s;tate of
inaction, it begins to labour, <PB N="80" REF="77"> extending and &s;hortening
its body; and by this means lining the walls of its apartment with a &s;ilken
tape&s;try, which it &s;pins in the manner of caterpillars, before they undergo
their la&s;t transformation. When their cell is thus pre|pared, the animal is
&s;oon after transformed into an aurelia; but differing from that of the
com|mon caterpillar, as it exhibits not only the legs, but the wings of the
future bee, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate of inactivity. Thus, in about twenty, or
one and twenty days after the egg was laid, the bee is completely formed, and
fitted to undergo the fatigues of its &s;tate. When all its parts have acquired
their proper &s;trength and con|&s;i&s;tence, the young animal opens its
pri&s;on, by piercing with its teeth the waxen door that con|fines it. When
ju&s;t freed from its cell, it is as yet moi&s;t, and incommoded with the
&s;poils of its former &s;ituation; but the officious bees are &s;oon &s;een to
flock round it, and to lick it clean on all &s;ides with their trunks; while
another band, with equal a&s;&s;iduity, are ob&s;erved to feed it with honey:
others again begin immediately to clean&s;e the cell that has been ju&s;t left;
to carry the or|dures out of the hive, and to fit the place for a new
inhabitant. The young bee &s;oon repays their care, by its indu&s;try; for as
&s;oon as ever its external parts become dry, it di&s;covers its na|tural 
<PB N="81" REF="78"> appetites for labour, and indu&s;triou&s;ly be|gins the
ta&s;k, which it pur&s;ues unremittingly through life. The toil of man is
irk&s;ome to him, and he earns his &s;ub&s;i&s;tance with pain; but this little
animal &s;eems happy in its pur|&s;uits, and finds delight in all its
employments.</P>
<P>When ju&s;t freed from the cell, and pro|perly equipped by its
fellow bees for duty, it at once i&s;&s;ues from the hive, and in&s;tructed
only by nature, goes in que&s;t of flowers, chu&s;es only tho&s;e that yield it
a &s;upply, rejects &s;uch as are barren of honey, or have been already drained
by other adventurers; and when load|ed, is never at a lo&s;s to find its way
back to the common habitation. After this fir&s;t &s;ally, it begins to gather
the mealy powder, that lies on every flower, which is afterwards converted into
wax; and with this, the very fir&s;t day, it returns with two large balls
&s;tuck to its thighs.</P>
<P>When bees fir&s;t begin to break their pri&s;ons, there are
generally above a hundred excluded in one day. Thus, in the &s;pace of a few
weeks, the number of the inhabitants in one hive, of moderate &s;ize, becomes
&s;o great, that there is no place to contain the new comers; and they are
&s;carcely excluded from the cell, when they are obliged, by the old bees, to
&s;ally forth in que&s;t of new habitations. In other words, the 
<PB N="82" REF="79"> hive begins to &s;warm, and the new progeny prepares for
exile.</P>
<P>While there is room enough in the hive, the bees remain quietly
together; it is nece&s;&s;ity alone that compels the &s;eparation. Sometimes,
indeed, the young brood, with gracele&s;s ob|&s;tinacy, refu&s;e to depart, and
even venture to re&s;i&s;t their progenitors. The young ones are known by being
browner than the old, with whiter hair; the old ones are of a lighter co|lour,
with red hair. The two armies are therefore ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable, and
dreadful battles are often &s;een to en&s;ue. But the victory almo&s;t ever
terminates with &s;trict poetical ju&s;tice in favour of the veterans, and the
re|bellious offspring are driven off, not without lo&s;s and mutilation.</P>
<P>In different countries, the &s;warms make their appearance at
different times of the year, and there are &s;everal &s;igns previous to this
in|tended migration. The night before, an un|u&s;ual buzzing is heard in the
hive; in the morning, though the weather be &s;oft and in|viting, they &s;eem
not to obey the call, being intent on more important meditations within. All
labour is di&s;continued in the hive, every bee is either employed in forcing,
or reluctant|ly yielding a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; at length, after &s;ome 
<PB N="83" REF="80"> noi&s;e and tumult, a queen bee is cho&s;en, to guard,
rather than conduct, the young colony to other habitations, and then they are
mar&s;halled with|out any apparent conductor. In le&s;s than a minute, they
leave their native abode, and form|ing a cloud round their protectre&s;s, they
&s;et off, without &s;eeming to know the place of their de&s;ti|nation; 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>The world before them, where to chu&s;e
their place of re&s;t.</HI></Q> The u&s;ual time of &s;warming, is from ten in
the morning, to three in the afternoon, when the &s;un &s;hines bright, and
invites them to &s;eek their fortunes. They flutter for a while, in the air,
like flakes of &s;now, and &s;ometimes un|dertake a di&s;tant journey, but more
frequently are contented with &s;ome neighbouring a&s;ylum; the branch of a
tree, a chimney top, or &s;ome other expo&s;ed &s;ituation. It is, indeed,
remark|able, that all tho&s;e animals, of what ever kind, that have long been
under the protection of man, &s;eem to lo&s;e a part of their natural
&s;aga|city, in providing for them&s;elves. The rabbit, when dome&s;ticated,
forgets to dig holes, the hen to build a ne&s;t, and the bee to &s;eek a
&s;helter, that &s;hall protect it from the inclemen|cies of winter. In tho&s;e
countries, where the bees are wild, and unprotected by man, they are always
&s;ure to build their waxen cells in the hollow of a tree; but with us, they
&s;eem im|provident <PB N="84" REF="81"> provident in their choice, and the
fir&s;t green branch that &s;tops their flight, &s;eems to be thought
&s;ufficient for their abode through win|ter. However, it does not appear, that
the queen chu&s;es the place where they are to alight, for many of the
&s;tragglers, who &s;eem to be plea&s;ed with a particular branch, go and
&s;ettle upon it; others are &s;een to &s;ucceed, and at la&s;t, the queen
her&s;elf, when &s;he finds a &s;ufficient number there before her, goes to
make it the place of her head quarters. When the queen is &s;ettled, the re&s;t
of the &s;warm &s;oon follow; and, in about a quarter of an hour, the whole
body &s;eem to be at ea&s;e. It &s;ometimes is found, that there are two or
three queens to a &s;warm, and the colony is divided into parties; but it
mo&s;t u&s;ually happens, that one of the&s;e is more con&s;iderable than the
other, and the bees by degrees, de&s;ert the weake&s;t, to take &s;helter under
the mo&s;t powerful protector. The de&s;erted queen does not long &s;urvive
this defeat; &s;he takes refuge under the new monarch, and is &s;oon
de&s;troyed by her jealous rival. Till this cruel execution is performed, the
bees never go out to work; and if there &s;hould be a queen bee, belonging to
the new colony, left in the old hive, &s;he always under|goes the fate of the
former. However, it mu&s;t <PB N="85" REF="82"> be ob&s;erved, that the bees
never &s;acrifice any of their queens, when the hive is full of wax and honey;
for there is at that time, no dan|ger in maintaining a plurality of
breeders.</P>
<P>When the &s;warm is thus conducted to a place of re&s;t, and the
policy of government is &s;ettled, the bees &s;oon re&s;ume their former
la|bours. The making cells, &s;toring them with honey, impregnating the queen,
making pro|per cells for the reception of the ri&s;ing progeny, and protecting
them from external danger, employ their uncea&s;ing indu&s;try. But &s;oon
after, and towards the latter end of &s;ummer, when the colony is
&s;ufficiently &s;tored with in|habitants, a mo&s;t cruel policy en&s;ues. The
drone bees, which are (as has been &s;aid) ge|nerally in a hive, to the number
of an hundred, are marked for &s;laughter. The&s;e, which had hitherto led a
life of indolence and plea&s;ure, who&s;e only employment was in impregnating
the queen, and rioting upon the labours of the hive, without aiding in the
general toil, now &s;hare the fate of mo&s;t voluptuaries, and fall a
&s;acrifice to the general re&s;entment of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The working bees, in a body, declare war again&s;t them; and in
two or three days time, the ground all round the hive is covered with their
dead bodies. Nay, the working bees <PB N="86" REF="83"> will even kill &s;uch
drones, as are yet in the worm &s;tate, in the cell, and eject their bodies
from the hive, among the general carnage.</P>
<P>When a hive &s;ends out &s;everal &s;warms in the year, the
fir&s;t is always the be&s;t, and the mo&s;t numerous. The&s;e, having the
whole &s;ummer before them, have the more time for mak|ing wax and honey, and
con&s;equently their labours are the mo&s;t valuable to the proprietor.
Although the &s;warm chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of the younge&s;t bees, yet it is
often found, that bees of all ages compo&s;e the multitude of emigrants, and it
often happens, that bees of all ages are &s;een remaining behind. The number of
them is always more con&s;iderable than that of &s;ome populous cities, for
&s;ometimes upwards of forty thou&s;and are found in a &s;ingle hive. So large
a body may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to work with great expedition; and in fact, in
le&s;s than twenty-four hours, they will make combs above twenty inches long,
and &s;even or eight broad. Sometimes they will half fill their hives with wax,
in le&s;s than five days. In the fir&s;t fifteen days, they are always found to
make more wax than they do afterwards during the re&s;t of the year.</P>
<P>Such are the out-lines of the natural hi&s;tory of the&s;e
annimals, as u&s;ually found in our own <PB N="87" REF="84"> country. How they
are treated, &s;o as to pro|duce the greate&s;t quantity of honey, belongs
rather to the rural oeconomi&s;t, than the natural hi&s;torian; volumes have
been written on the &s;ubject, and &s;till more remains equally curious and
new. One thing, however, it may be pro|per to ob&s;erve, that a farm, or a
country, may be over &s;tocked with bees, as with any other &s;ort of animal;
for a certain number of hives, always require a certain number of flowers to
&s;ub&s;i&s;t on. When the flowers near home are rifled, then are the&s;e
indu&s;trious in&s;ects &s;een tak|ing more exten&s;ive ranges, but their
abilities may be over taxed; and if they are obliged, in que&s;t of honey, to
go too far from home, they are over-wearied in the pur&s;uit, they are
devour|ed by birds, or beat down by the winds and rain.</P>
<P>For a knowledge of this, in &s;ome parts of France and Piedmont,
they have contrived, as I have often &s;een, a kind of floating
bee-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>They have on board one barge, three&s;core or an hundred
bee-hives, well defended from the inclemency of an accidental &s;torm; and with
the&s;e, the owners &s;uffer them&s;elves to float gently down the river. As
the bees are con|tinually chu&s;ing their flowery pa&s;ture along the banks of
the &s;tream, they are furni&s;hed with &s;weets before unrifled; and thus a
&s;ingle float|ing <PB N="88" REF="85"> bee-hou&s;e, yields the proprietor a
con&s;ider|able income. Why a method &s;imilar to this has never been adopted
in England, where we have more gentle rivers, and more flowery banks, than in
any other part of the world, I know not; certainly it might be turned to
ad|vantage, and yield the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or a &s;ecure, though perhaps a
moderate income.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the indu&s;try of the&s;e ad|mirable in&s;ects,
it will be proper to &s;ay &s;ome|thing of the effects of their labour, of that
wax and honey, which are turned by man to &s;uch various u&s;es. Bees gather
two kinds of wax, one coar&s;e and the other fine. The coar&s;er &s;ort is
bitter, and with this, which is called <HI>propolis,</HI> they &s;top up all
the holes and crevices of their hives. It is of a more re&s;inous nature than
the fine wax, and is con&s;equently better qualified to re&s;i&s;t the
moi&s;ture of the &s;ea&s;on, and pre&s;erve the works warm and dry within. The
fine wax is as nece&s;&s;ary to the animals pre&s;ervation as the honey
it&s;elf. With this they make their lodg|ings, with this they cover the cells
of their young, and in this they lay up their magazines of honey. This is made,
as has been already ob&s;erved, from the du&s;t of flowers, which is carefully
kneaded by the little in&s;ect, then &s;wallowed, and having undergone a kind
of di|ge&s;tion, <PB N="89" REF="86"> is formed into the cells, which an&s;wers
&s;uch a variety of purpo&s;es. To collect this, the animal rolls it&s;elf in
the flower it would rob, and thus takes up the vegetable du&s;t with the hair
of its body. Then carefully bru&s;hing it into a lump, with its fore paws it
thru&s;ts the compo&s;ition into two cavities behind the thighs, which are made
like &s;poons to receive the wax, and the hair that lines them, &s;erves to
keep it from falling.</P>
<P>As of wax, there are al&s;o two kinds of honey. The white and
the yellow. The white is taken without fire from the honey-combs. The yellow is
extracted by heat, and &s;queezed through bags, in a pre&s;s. The be&s;t honey
is new, thick and granulated, of a clear tran&s;parent white colour, of a
&s;oft and aromatic &s;mell, and of a &s;weet lively ta&s;te. Honey made in
moun|tainous countries, is preferable to that of the valley. The honey made in
the &s;pring, is more highly e&s;teemed, than that gathered in &s;ummer, which
la&s;t is &s;till more valuable, than that of autumn, when the flowers begin to
fade and lo&s;e their fragrance.</P>
<P>The bees are nearly alike in all parts of the world, yet there
are differences worthy our notice. In Guadaloupe, the bee is le&s;s by one
half, than the European, and more black and <PB N="90" REF="87"> round. They
have no &s;ting, and make their cells in hollow trees; where, if the hole they
meet with is too large, they form a &s;ort of waxen hou&s;e, of the &s;hape of
a pear, and in this they lodge and &s;tore their honey, and lay their eggs.
They lay up their honey in waxen ve&s;&s;els, of the &s;ize of a pigeon's egg,
of a black or deep violet colour; and the&s;e are &s;o joined to|gether, that
there is no &s;pace left between them. The honey never congeals, but is fluid,
of the con&s;i&s;tence of oil, and the colour of amber. Re&s;embling the&s;e,
there are found little black bees, without a &s;ting, in all the tropical
cli|mates; and though the&s;e countries are replete with bees, like our own,
yet tho&s;e form the mo&s;t u&s;eful and laborious tribe in that part of the
world. The honey they produce, is neither &s;o unpalatable, nor &s;o
&s;urfeiting as ours; and the wax is &s;o &s;oft, that it is only u&s;ed for
medi|cinal purpo&s;es, it being never found hard enough to form into candles,
as in Europe.</P>
<P>Of in&s;ects, that receive the name of bees, among us, there are
&s;everal; which, however, differ very widely from that indu&s;trious &s;ocial
race we have been ju&s;t de&s;cribing. The HUM|BLE BEE is the large&s;t of all
this tribe, being as large as the fir&s;t joint of one's middle finger. The&s;e
are &s;een in every field, and perched on <PB N="87" REF="88"> every flower.
They build their ne&s;t in holes in the ground, of dry leaves, mixed with wax
and wool, defended with mo&s;s from the weather. Each humble bee makes a
&s;eparate cell about the &s;ize of a &s;mall nutmeg, which is round and
hollow, containing the honey in a bag. Se|veral of the&s;e cells are joined
together, in &s;uch a manner, that the whole appears like a clu&s;ter of
grapes. The females, which have the ap|pearance of wa&s;ps, are very few, and
their eggs are laid in cells, which the re&s;t &s;oon cover over with wax. It
is uncertain whether they have a queen or not; but there is one much larger
than the re&s;t, without wings, and with|out hair, and all over black, like
poli&s;hed ebony. This goes and views all the works, from time to time, and
enters into the cell, as if it wanted to &s;ee whether every thing was done
right: In the morning, the young humble bees are very idle, and &s;eem not at
all inclined to labour, till one of the large&s;t, about &s;even o'clock,
thru&s;ts half its body from a hole, de&s;igned for that purpo&s;e, and
&s;eated on the top of the ne&s;t, beats its wings for twenty minutes
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively, buzzing the whole time, till the whole colony is put in
motion. The humble bees gather honey, as well as the com|mon 
<PB N="92" REF="89"> bees; but it is neither &s;o fine, nor &s;o good, nor the
wax &s;o clean, or &s;o capable of fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the bees already mentioned, there are various kinds
among us, that have much the appearance of honey-makers, and yet make only wax.
The WOOD BEE is &s;een in every garden. It is rather larger than the common
queen bee; its body of a bluei&s;h black, which is &s;mooth and &s;hining. It
begins to appear at the ap|proach of &s;pring, and is &s;een flying near walls
expo&s;ed to a &s;unny a&s;pect. This bee makes its ne&s;t in &s;ome piece of
wood, which it contrives to &s;coop and hollow for its purpo&s;e. This,
however, is never done in trees that are &s;tand|ing, for the wood it makes
choice of is half rotten. The holes are not made directly for|ward, but turning
to one &s;ide, and have an opening &s;ufficient to admit one's middle finger;
from whence runs the inner apartment, gene|rally twelve or fifteen inches long.
The in&s;tru|ments u&s;ed in boring the&s;e cavities, are their teeth; the
cavity is u&s;ually branched into three or four apartments; and in each of
the&s;e, they lay their eggs, to the number of ten or twelve, each &s;eparate
and di&s;tinct from the re&s;t: The egg is involved in a &s;ort of pa&s;te,
which &s;erves at once for the young animal's protection <PB N="93" REF="90">
and nouri&s;hment. The grown bees, however, feed upon &s;mall in&s;ects,
particularly a lou&s;e, of a reddi&s;h brown colour, of the &s;ize of a &s;mall
pin's head.</P>
<P>MASON BEES make their cells with a &s;ort of mortar, made of
earth, which they build again&s;t a wall that is expo&s;ed to the &s;un. The
mortar, which at fir&s;t is &s;oft, &s;oon becomes as hard as &s;tone, and in
this their eggs are laid. Each ne&s;t contains &s;even or eight cells, an egg
in every cell, placed regularly one over the other. If the ne&s;t remains
unhurt, or wants but little repairs, they make u&s;e of them the year
en&s;uing: and thus they often &s;erve three or four years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively.
From the &s;trength of their hou&s;es, one would think the&s;e bees in perfect
&s;ecurity, yet none are more expo&s;ed than they. A worm with very &s;trong
teeth, is often found to bore into their little fortifica|tions, and devour
their young.</P>
<P>The GROUND BEE builds its ne&s;t in the earth, wherein they make
round holes, five or &s;ix inches deep; the mouth being narrow, and only ju&s;t
&s;ufficient to admit the little inhabi|tant. It is amu&s;ing enough, to
ob&s;erve the patience and a&s;&s;iduity with which they labour. They carry out
all the earth, grain by grain, to the mouth of the hole, where it forms a
little <PB N="94" REF="91"> hillock, an Alps compared to the power of the
arti&s;t by which it is rai&s;ed. Sometimes the walks of a garden are found
undermined by their labours; &s;ome of the holes running directly downward,
others horizontally be|neath the &s;urface. They lay up in the&s;e ca|vities
provi&s;ions for their young, which con&s;i&s;t of a pa&s;te that has the
appearance of corn, and is of a &s;weeti&s;h ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The LEAF-CUTTING BEES make their ne&s;t and lay their eggs among
bits of leaves, very artificially placed in holes in the earth, of about the
length of a tooth-pick ca&s;e. They make the bits of leaves of a roundi&s;h
form, and with them line the in&s;ide of their habita|tions. This tape&s;try is
&s;till further lined by a reddi&s;h kind of pa&s;te, &s;omewhat &s;weet or
acid. The&s;e bees are of various kinds; tho&s;e that build their ne&s;ts with
che&s;nut-leaves are as big as drones, but tho&s;e of the ro&s;e-tree are
&s;maller than the common bee.</P>
<P>The WALL BEES are &s;o called, becau&s;e they make their ne&s;ts
in walls of a kind of &s;ilky membrane with which they fill up the vacuities
between the &s;mall &s;tones which form the &s;ides of their habitation. Their
apartment con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal cells placed end to end, each in the
&s;hape of a woman's thimble. Though the <PB N="95" REF="92"> web which lines
this habitation is thick and warm, yet it is tran&s;parent and of a whiti&s;h
colour. This &s;ub&s;tance is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;pun from the animal's body;
the male and females are of a &s;ize, but the former are without a &s;ting. To
the&s;e varieties of the bee kind might be added &s;everal others which are all
different in nature, but not &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed to excite
curio&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Wa&s;p and Hornet.</HEAD>
<P>HOWEVER &s;imilar many in&s;ects may be in appearance, this does
not imply a &s;imilitude in their hi&s;tory. The bee and the wa&s;p re|&s;emble
each other very &s;trongly, yet, in ex|amining their manner and their duration,
they differ very widely; the bee labours to lay up honey, and lives to enjoy
the fruits of its indu|&s;try; the wa&s;p appears equally a&s;&s;iduous, but
only works for po&s;terity, as the habitation is &s;carcely completed when the
inhabitant dies.</P>
<P>The wa&s;p is well known to be a winged in|&s;ect with a
&s;ting. To be longer in proportion to its bulk than the bee, to be marked with
bright yellow circles round its body, and to be the mo&s;t &s;wift and active
in&s;ect of all the fly kind. On each &s;ide of the mouth this animal is
furni&s;hed with a long tooth, notched like a &s;aw, and with the&s;e it is
enabled to cut any &s;ub&s;tance, not omitting meat it&s;elf, and to carry it
to its ne&s;t. Wa&s;ps live like bees in community, and &s;ometimes ten or
twelve thou&s;and are found inhabiting a &s;ingle ne&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="94">Of all other in&s;ects the wa&s;p is the
mo&s;t fierce, voracious, and mo&s;t dangerous, when enraged. They are &s;een
wherever fle&s;h is cutting up, gorging them&s;elves with the &s;poil, and then
flying to their ne&s;ts with their reeking prey. They make war al&s;o on every
other fly, and the &s;pider him&s;elf dreads their ap|proaches.</P>
<P>Every community among bees is compo&s;ed of females or queens,
drones or males, and neutral or working bees. Wa&s;ps have &s;imilar
occupations; the two fir&s;t are for propagating the &s;pecies, the la&s;t for
nur&s;ing, defending and &s;upporting the ri&s;ing progeny. Among bees,
however, there is &s;eldom above a queen or two in an hive; among wa&s;ps there
are above two or three hundred.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;ummer begins to invigorate the in&s;ect
tribes, the wa&s;ps are the mo&s;t of the number, and diligently employed
either in providing provi&s;ions for their ne&s;t, if already made, or in
making one, if the former habi|tation be too &s;mall to receive the
encrea&s;ing community. The ne&s;t is one of the mo&s;t cu|rious objects in
natural hi&s;tory, and contrived almo&s;t as artificially as that of the bees
them|&s;elves. Their principal care is to &s;eek out an hole that has been
begun by &s;ome other ani|mal, <PB N="98" REF="95"> a field mou&s;e, a rat, or
a mole, to build their ne&s;ts in. They &s;ometimes build upon the plain, where
they are &s;ure of the dryne&s;s of their &s;ituation, but mo&s;t commonly on
the &s;ide of a bank to avoid the rain or water that would otherwi&s;e annoy
them. When they have cho&s;en a proper place they go to work with wonderful
a&s;&s;iduity. Their fir&s;t labour is to enlarge and widen the hole, taking
away the earth and carrying it off to &s;ome di&s;tance. They are perfectly
formed for labour, being furni&s;hed with a trunk above their mouths, two
&s;aws on each &s;ide which play to the right and left again&s;t each other,
and &s;ix &s;trong mu&s;cu|lar legs to &s;upport them. They cut the earth into
&s;mall parcels with their &s;aws, and carry it out with their legs or paws.
This is the work of &s;ome days; and at length the outline of their habitation
is formed, making a cavity of about a foot and an half every way. While &s;ome
are working in this manner, others are roving the fields to &s;eek out
materials for their building. To prevent the earth from falling down and
cru&s;hing their ri&s;ing city into ruin, they make a &s;ort of roof with their
gluey &s;ub&s;tance, to which they begin to fix the ru|diments of their
building, working from the top downwards, as if they were hanging a 
<PB N="99" REF="96"> bell, which, however at length they clo&s;e up at the
bottom. The materials with which they build their ne&s;ts are bits of wood and
glue. The wood they get where they can from the rails and po&s;ts which they
meet with in the fields and el&s;ewhere. The&s;e they &s;aw and di|vide into a
multitude of &s;mall fibres, of which they take up little bundles in their
claws, letting fall upon them a few drops of gluey matter with which their
bodies are provided, by the help of which they knead the whole compo&s;ition
into a pa&s;te, which &s;erves them in their future building. When they have
returned with this to the ne&s;t, they &s;tick their load of pa&s;te on that
part where they make their walls and par|titions; they tread it clo&s;e with
their feet, and trowel it with their trunks, &s;till going back|wards as they
work. Having repeated this ope|ration three or four times, the compo&s;ition is
at length flatted out until it becomes a &s;mall leaf of a grey colour, much
finer than paper, and of a pretty firm texture. This done the &s;ame wa&s;p
returns to the field to collect a &s;econd load of pa&s;te, repeating the
&s;ame &s;everal times, placing layer upon layer, and &s;trengthening eve|ry
partition in proportion to the wants or con|veniencies of the general fabric.
Other work|ing wa&s;ps come quickly after to repeat the &s;ame 
<PB N="100" REF="97"> operation, laying more leaves upon the former, till at
length, after much toil, they have fini&s;h|ed the large roof which is to
&s;ecure them from the tumbling in of the earth. This dome be|ing fini&s;hed,
they make another entrance to their habitation, de&s;igned either for letting
in the warmth of the &s;un, or for e&s;caping in ca&s;e one door be invaded by
plunderers. Cer|tain however it is, that by one of the&s;e they al|ways enter,
by the other they &s;ally forth to their toil; each hole being &s;o &s;mall
that they can pa&s;s but one at a time. The walls being thus compo&s;ed, and
the whole &s;omewhat of the &s;hape of a pear, they labour at their cells,
which they compo&s;e of the &s;ame paper-like &s;ub&s;tance that goes to the
formation of their out&s;ide works. Their combs differ from tho&s;e of bees,
not le&s;s in the compo&s;ition than the po&s;ition which they are always
&s;een to obtain. The honey-comb of the bee is edgeways with re&s;pect to the
hive; that of the wa&s;p is flat, and the mouth of every cell opens downwards.
Thus is their habitation, contrived &s;tory above &s;tory, &s;upported by
&s;everal rows of pillars which give firmne&s;s to the whole building, while
the upper &s;tory is flat-roofed, and as &s;mooth as the pave|ment of a room,
laid with &s;quares of marble. The wa&s;ps can freely walk upon the&s;e
&s;tories <PB N="101" REF="98"> between the pillars to do whatever their wants
require. The pillars are very hard and com|pact, being larger at each end than
in the middle, not much unlike the columns of a building. All the cells of the
ne&s;t are only de|&s;tined for the reception of the young, being replete with
neither wax nor honey.</P>
<P>Each cell is like that of the bee, hexagonal; but they are of
two &s;orts, the one larger for the production of the male and female wa&s;ps,
the other le&s;s for the reception of the working part of the community. When
the females are im|pregnated by the males, they lay their eggs, one in each
cell, and &s;tick it in with a kind of gummy matter to prevent its falling out.
From this egg proceeds the in&s;ect in its worm-&s;tate, of which the old ones
are extremely careful, feeding it from time to time till it becomes large and
entirely fills up its cell. But the wa&s;p community differs from that of the
bee in this; that among the latter the working bees take the parental duties
upon them, whereas among the wa&s;ps the females alone are permitted to feed
their young, and to nur&s;e their ri&s;ing pro|geny. For this purpo&s;e the
female waits with great patience till the working wa&s;ps have brought in their
provi&s;ions, which &s;he takes from them, and cuts into pieces. She then goes 
<PB N="102" REF="99"> with great compo&s;ure from cell to cell, and feeds every
young one with her mouth. When the young worms have come to a certain &s;ize
they leave off eating, and begin to &s;pin a very fine &s;ilk, fixing the
fir&s;t end to the entrance of the cell, then turning their heads, fir&s;t on
one &s;ide, then on the other, they fix the thread to different parts, and thus
they make a &s;ort of a door which &s;erves to clo&s;e up the mouth of the
cell. After this they dive&s;t them&s;elves of their &s;kins after the u&s;ual
mode of transforma|tion, the aurelia by degrees begins to emanci|pate it&s;elf
from its &s;hell; by little and little it thru&s;ts out its legs and wings, and
in&s;en&s;ibly acquires the colour and &s;hape of its parent.</P>
<P>The wa&s;p thus formed, and prepared for de|predation, becomes a
bold, trouble&s;ome, and dangerous in&s;ect: there are no dangers which it will
not encounter in pur&s;uit of its prey, and nothing &s;eems to &s;atiate its
gluttony. Though it can gather no honey of its own, no animal is more fond of
&s;weets. For this purpo&s;e it will pur&s;ue the bee and the humble bee,
de|&s;troy them with its &s;ting, and then plunder them of their honey-bag,
with which it flies triumphantly loaded to its ne&s;t to regale its young.
Wa&s;ps are ever fond of making their ne&s;ts in the neighbourhood of bees,
merely to <PB N="103" REF="100"> have an opportunity of robbing their hives,
and fea&s;ting on the &s;poil. Yet the bees are not found always patiently
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to their ty|ranny, but fierce battles are &s;ometimes &s;een
to en&s;ue, in which the bees make up by conduct and numbers what they want in
per&s;onal prow|e&s;s. When there is no honey to be had, they &s;eek for the
be&s;t and &s;weete&s;t fruits, and they are never mi&s;taken in their choice.
From the garden they fly to the city, to the grocers &s;hops, and butchers
&s;hambles. They will &s;ometimes carry off bits of fle&s;h half as big as
them&s;elves, with which they fly to their ne&s;ts for the nouri&s;hment of
their brood. Tho&s;e who cannot drive them away, lay for them a piece of ox's
liver, which being without fibres, they prefer to other fle&s;h; and whenever
they are found, all other flies are &s;een to de&s;ert the place immediately.
Such is the dread with which the&s;e little animals impre&s;s all the re&s;t of
the in&s;ect tribes, which they &s;eize and devour without mercy, that they
vani&s;h at their ap|proach. Wherever they fly, like the eagle or the falcon,
they form a de&s;ert in the air around them. In this manner the &s;ummer is
pa&s;&s;ed in plundering the neighbourhood, and rearing up their young; every
day adds to their numbers; and from their &s;trength, agility, and
indi&s;criminate appetite for every kind of pro|vi&s;ion, <PB N="104" REF="101"> were they as long lived as the bee, they would &s;oon &s;warm upon
the face of nature, and become the mo&s;t noxious plague of man: but
providentially their lives are mea&s;ured to their mi&s;chief, and they live
but a &s;ingle &s;ea|&s;on.</P>
<P>While the &s;ummer heats continue, they are bold, voracious, and
enterprizing; but as the &s;un withdraws, it &s;eems to rob them of their
courage and activity. In proportion as the cold encrea&s;es, they are &s;een to
become more do|me&s;tic; they &s;eldom leave the ne&s;t, they make but &s;hort
adventures from home, they flutter about in the noon-day heats, and &s;oon
after return chilled and feeble.</P>
<P>As their calamities encrea&s;e, new pa&s;&s;ions &s;oon begin to
take place; the care for po&s;te|rity no longer continues, and as the parents
are no longer able to provide their grow|ing progeny a &s;upply, they take the
barba|rous re&s;olution of &s;acrificing them all to the nece&s;&s;ity of the
times. In this manner, like a garri&s;on upon &s;hort allowance, all the
u&s;ele&s;s hands are de&s;troyed; the young worms, which a little before they
fed and protected with &s;o much a&s;&s;iduity, are now butchered and dragged
fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">m their cells. As the cold
encrea&s;es they no longer find &s;ufficient warmth in their ne&s;ts, which
grow hateful to them, and they fly to <PB N="105" REF="102"> &s;eek it in the
corners of hou&s;es, and places that receive an artificial heat. But the winter
is &s;till in&s;upportable; and, before the new year begins, they wither and
die; the working bees fir&s;t, the males &s;oon following, and many of the
fe|males &s;uffering in the general calamity. In every ne&s;t, however, one or
two females &s;urvive the winter, and having been impregnated by the male
during the preceding &s;ea&s;on, &s;he begins in &s;pring to lay her eggs in a
little hole of her own contrivance. This bundle of eggs, which is clu&s;tered
together like grapes, &s;oon produces two worms which the female takes proper
pre|caution to defend and &s;upply, and the&s;e when hatched &s;oon give
a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the female, who is employed in hatching two more; the&s;e
al&s;o gathering &s;trength, extricate them&s;elves out of the web that
enclo&s;ed them, and become likewi&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tants to their mother;
fifteen days after, two more make their appearance; thus is the community every
day encrea&s;ing, while the female lays in every cell, fir&s;t a male and then
a female. The&s;e &s;oon after become breed|ers in turn, till, from a &s;ingle
female, ten thou|&s;and wa&s;ps are &s;een produced before the month of June.
After the female has thus produ|ced her progeny, which are di&s;tributed in
dif|ferent di&s;tricts, they a&s;&s;emble from all parts, <PB N="106" REF="103"> in the middle of &s;ummer, and provide for them&s;elves the large
and commodious habita|tion, which has been de&s;cribed above.</P>
<P>Such is the hi&s;tory of the &s;ocial wa&s;p; but, as among
bees, &s;o al&s;o among the&s;e in&s;ects, there are various tribes that live
in &s;olitude: the&s;e lay their eggs in a hole for the purpo&s;e, and the
parent dies long before the birth of its offspring. In the principal &s;pecies
of the SOLITARY WASPS, the in&s;ect is &s;maller than the working wa&s;p of the
&s;ocial kind. The fila|ment, by which the cor&s;elet is joined to the body, is
longer and more di&s;tinctly &s;een, and the whole colour of the in&s;ect is
blacker than in the ordinary kinds. But it is not their figure, but the manners
of this extraordinary in&s;ect that claim our principal regard.</P>
<P>From the end of May to the beginning of July, this wa&s;p is
&s;een mo&s;t diligently em|ployed. The whole purpo&s;e of its life &s;eems to
be in contriving and fitting up a commodious apartment for its young one, which
is not to &s;ucceed it till the year en&s;uing. For this end it is employed,
with unwearied a&s;&s;iduity, in boring a hole into the fine&s;t earth &s;ome
inches deep, but not much wider than the diameter of its own body. This is but
a gallery lead|ing to a wider apartment de&s;tined for the con|venient 
<PB N="107" REF="104"> lodgment of its young. As it always chu&s;es a gravelly
&s;oil to work in, and where the earth is almo&s;t as hard as &s;tone it&s;elf;
the digging and hollowing this apartment is an enterprize of no &s;mall labour:
for effecting its operations, this in&s;ect is furni&s;hed with two teeth,
which are &s;trong and firm, but not &s;ufficiently hard to penetrate the
&s;ub&s;tance through which it is re&s;olved to make its way. In order
therefore to &s;often that earth which it is unable to pierce, it is
furni&s;hed with a gummy liquor which it emits upon the place, and which
renders it more ea&s;ily &s;eparable from the re&s;t, and the whole becoming a
kind of &s;oft pa&s;te is removed to the mouth of the habi|tation. The animal's
provi&s;ion of liquor in the&s;e operations is however &s;oon exhau&s;ted; and
it is then &s;een either taking up water from &s;ome neighbouring flower or
&s;tream in order to &s;upply the deficiency.</P>
<P>At length, after much toil, a hole &s;ome inches deep is formed,
at the bottom of which is a large cavity; and to this no other ho&s;tile
in&s;ect would venture to find its way, from the length and the narrowne&s;s of
the defile through which it would be obliged to pa&s;s. In this the &s;olitary
wa&s;p lays its egg, which is de&s;tined to continue the &s;pecies; there the
na&s;cent animal <PB N="108" REF="105"> is to continue for above nine months,
unattend|ed and immured, and at fir&s;t appearance the mo&s;t helple&s;s
in&s;ect of the creation. But when we come to examine, new wonders offer, no
other in&s;ect can boa&s;t &s;o copiou&s;ly luxurious a provi&s;ion, or &s;uch
confirmed &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the mother wa&s;p has depo&s;ited her egg at the
bottom of the hole, her next care is to furni&s;h it with a &s;upply of
provi&s;ions, which may be offered to the young in&s;ect as &s;oon as it leaves
the egg. To this end &s;he procures a number of little green worms, generally
from eight to twelve, and the&s;e are to &s;erve as food for the young one the
in&s;tant it awakens into life. When this &s;upply is regularly arranged and
laid in, the old one then, with as much a&s;&s;iduity as it before worked out
its hole, now clo&s;es the mouth of the pa&s;&s;age; and thus leaving its young
one immured in perfect &s;e|curity, and in a copious &s;upply of animal food,
&s;he dies &s;atisfied with having provided for a future progeny.</P>
<P>When the young one leaves the egg it is &s;carcely vi&s;ible,
and is &s;een immured among a number of in&s;ects, infinitely larger than
it&s;elf, ranged in proper order around it, which, how|ever give it no manner
of apprehen&s;ion. Whe|ther the parent, when &s;he laid in the in&s;ect 
<PB N="109" REF="106"> provi&s;ion, contrived to di&s;able the worms from
re&s;i&s;tance, or whether they were at fir&s;t incapa|ble of any, is not
known. Certain it is, that the young glutton fea&s;ts upon the living &s;poil
without any controul; his game lies at his hand, and he devours one after the
other as the calls of appetite incite him. The life of the young animal is
therefore &s;pent in the mo&s;t luxurious manner, till its whole &s;tock of
worms is exhau&s;ted, and then the time of its transfor|mation begins to
approach; and then &s;pinning a &s;ilken web, it continues fixed in its cell
till the &s;un calls it from its dark abode the en&s;uing &s;ummer.</P>
<P>The wa&s;ps of Europe are very mi&s;chievous, yet they are
innocence it&s;elf when compared to tho&s;e of the tropical climates, where all
the in&s;ect tribes are not only numerous, but large, voracious, and
formidable. Tho&s;e of the We&s;t Indies are thicker, and twice as long as the
common bee; they are of a grey colour, &s;triped with yellow, and armed with a
very dangerous &s;ting. They make their cells in the manner of a honey-comb, in
which the young ones are hatched and bred. They generally hang their ne&s;ts by
threads, compo&s;ed of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance with the cells, to the branches
of trees, and the eaves of hou&s;es. They are <PB N="110" REF="107"> &s;een
every where in great abundance, de|&s;cending like fruit, particularly pears,
of which &s;hape they are, and as large as one's head. The in&s;ide is divided
into three round &s;tories, full of cells, each hexagonal, like tho&s;e of an
honey-comb. In &s;ome of the i&s;lands, the&s;e in&s;ects are &s;o very
numerous, that their ne&s;ts are &s;tuck up in this manner, &s;carce two feet
a&s;under, and the inhabitants are in con|tinual apprehen&s;ion from their
accidental re|&s;entment. It &s;ometimes happens, that no pre|cautions can
prevent their attacks, and the pains of their &s;ting is almo&s;t
in&s;upportable. Tho&s;e who have felt it think it more terrible than even that
of a &s;corpion; the whole vi&s;age &s;wells, and the features are &s;o
disfigured, that a per&s;on is &s;carcely known by his mo&s;t intimate
acquaintance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Ichnumon Fly.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY rank of in&s;ects, how voracious &s;oever, have enemies
that are terrible to them, and that revenge upon them the injuries done upon
the re&s;t of the animated creation. The wa&s;p, as we have &s;een, is very
trouble&s;ome to man, and very formidable to the in&s;ect tribe; but the
ichnumon fly (of which there are many varieties) fears not the wa&s;p it&s;elf,
it enters its retreats, plunders its habitations, and takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of that cell for its own young, which the wa&s;p had laboriou&s;ly built for a
dearer po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Though there are many different kinds of this in&s;ect, yet the
mo&s;t formidable, and that be&s;t known, is called the common ichnumon, with
four wings, like the bee, a long &s;lender black body, and a three forked tail,
con&s;i&s;ting of bri&s;tles; the two outermo&s;t black, and the middlemo&s;t
red. This fly receives its name from the little quadrupede, which is found to
be &s;o de&s;tructive to the crocodile, as it bears a &s;trong &s;imilitude in
its courage and rapacity.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="109">Though this in&s;trument is, to all
appearance, &s;lender and feeble, yet it is found to be a wea|pon of great
force and efficacy. There is &s;carce any &s;ub&s;tance which it will not
pierce; and, indeed, it is &s;eldom &s;een but employed in pe|netration. This
is the weapon of defence, this is employed in de&s;troying its prey, and
&s;till more, by this the animal depo&s;ites her eggs where|ever &s;he thinks
fit to lay them. As it is an in&s;trument chiefly employed for this purpo&s;e,
the male is unprovided with &s;uch a &s;ting, while the female u&s;es it with
great force and dexterity, brandi&s;hing it when caught, from &s;ide to &s;ide,
and very often wounding tho&s;e who thought they held her with the greate&s;t
&s;ecurity.</P>
<P>All the flies of this tribe are produced in the &s;ame manner,
and owe their birth to the de|&s;truction of &s;ome other in&s;ect, within
who&s;e body they have been depo&s;ed, and upon who&s;e vitals they have
preyed, till they came to ma|turity. There is no in&s;ect whatever, which they
will not attack, in order to leave their fatal pre&s;ent in its body; the
caterpillar, the gnat, and even the &s;pider him&s;elf, &s;o formid|able to
others, is often made the unwilling fo&s;terer of this de&s;tructive
progeny.</P>
<P>About the middle of &s;ummer, when other in&s;ects are found in
great abundance, the ich|numon <PB N="113" REF="110"> is &s;een flying bu&s;ily
about, and &s;eeking proper objects upon whom to depo&s;e its pro|geny. As
there are various kinds of this fly, &s;o they &s;eem to have various
appetites. Some are found to place their eggs within the aurelia of &s;ome
na&s;cent in&s;ect, others place them within the ne&s;t, which the wa&s;p had
curiou&s;ly contrived for its own young; and as both are produced at the &s;ame
time, the young of the ichnumon, not only devours the young wa&s;p, but the
whole &s;upply of worms, which the parent had carefully provided for its
provi&s;ion. But the greate&s;t number of the ichnumon tribe are &s;een
&s;ettling upon the back of the caterpillar, and darting, at different
intervals, their &s;tings into its body. At every dart they depo&s;e an egg,
while the wounded animal &s;eems &s;carcely &s;en&s;i|ble of the injury it
&s;u&s;tains. In this manner they leave from &s;ix to a dozen of their eggs,
within the fatty &s;ub&s;tance of the reptile's body, and then fly off to
commit further depredations. In the mean time the caterpillar thus irreparably
injured, &s;eems to feed as voraciou&s;ly as before, does not abate of its
u&s;ual activity; and to all appearance, &s;eems no way affected by the
in|ternal enemies that are preparing its de&s;truction in their dark&s;ome
abode. But they &s;oon bur&s;t from their egg &s;tate, and begin to prey upon 
<PB N="114" REF="111"> the &s;ub&s;tance of their pri&s;on. As they grow
larger, they require a greater &s;upply, till at la&s;t the animal, by who&s;e
vitals they are &s;up|ported, is no longer able to &s;u&s;tain them, but dies;
its whole in&s;ide being almo&s;t eaten away. It often happens, however, that
it &s;urvives their worm &s;tate, and then they change into a chry&s;alis,
enclo&s;ed in the caterpillar's body till the time of their delivery
approaches, when they bur&s;t their pri&s;ons and fly away. The caterpillar,
however, is irreparably de&s;troyed, it never changes into a chry&s;alis, but
dies &s;hortly after, from the injuries it had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>Such is the hi&s;tory of this fly, which though very terrible to
the in&s;ect tribe, fails not to be of infinite &s;ervice to mankind. The
millions which it kills in a &s;ingle &s;ummer, are uncon|ceiveable; and
without &s;uch a de&s;troyer, the fruits of the earth would only ri&s;e to
furni&s;h a banquet for the in&s;ect race, to the exclu&s;ion of all the nobler
ranks of animated nature.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="115" REF="112">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Ant.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the number of two winged flies be very great, and the
naturali&s;ts have taken &s;ome pains to de&s;cribe their characters and
varieties; yet there is &s;uch a &s;imilitude in their forms and manners, that
in a work like this, one de&s;cription mu&s;t &s;erve for all. We now
therefore, come to a &s;pecies of four winged in&s;ects, that are famous from
all antiquity, for their &s;ocial and indu&s;trious habits, that are marked for
their &s;pirit of &s;ubordination, that are offered as a pattern of
par&s;imony, to the profu&s;e, and of unremitting diligence to the
&s;luggard.</P>
<P>In the experiments, however, which have been more recently made,
and the ob&s;ervations which have been taken, much of their boa&s;ted frugality
and precaution &s;eems denied them; the trea&s;ures they lay up, are no longer
&s;up|po&s;ed, intended for future provi&s;ion, and the choice they make in
their &s;tores, &s;eems no way dictated by wi&s;dom. It is, indeed, &s;omewhat
&s;urprizing, that almo&s;t every writer of antiqui|ty, &s;hould de&s;cribe
this in&s;ect, as labouring in the &s;ummer, and fea&s;ting upon the produce 
<PB N="116" REF="113"> during the winter. Perhaps, in &s;ome of the warmer
climates, where the winter is mild, and of &s;hort contiuance, this may take
place; but in France and England, the&s;e animals can have no manner of
occa&s;ion for a &s;upply of winter provi&s;ions, as they are actually in a
&s;tate of torpidity during that &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The common ants of Europe, are of two or three different kinds;
&s;ome red, &s;ome black, &s;ome with &s;tings, and others without. Such as
have &s;tings, inflict their wounds in that manner; &s;uch as are unprovided
with the&s;e weapons of defence, have a power of &s;purting, from their hinder
parts, an acid pungent liquor, which, if it lights upon the &s;kin, inflames
and burns it like nettles.</P>
<P>The body of an ant is divided, into the head, brea&s;t and
belly. In the head, the eyes are placed, which are entirely black, and under
the eyes, there are two &s;mall horns or feelers, compo&s;ed of twelve joints,
all covered with a fine &s;ilky hair. The mouth is furni&s;hed with two crooked
jaws, which project outwards, in each of which are &s;een inci&s;ures, that
look like teeth. The brea&s;t is covered with a fine &s;ilky hair, from which
project &s;ix legs, that are pretty &s;trong and hairy, the extremities of each
armed with two &s;mall claws, which the animal u&s;es in <PB N="117" REF="114">
climbing. The belly is more reddi&s;h than the re&s;t of the body, which is of
a brown che&s;nut colour, it is as &s;hining as gla&s;s, and covered with
extremely fine hair.</P>
<P>From &s;uch a formation, this animal &s;eems bolder, and more
active, for its &s;ize, than any other of the in&s;ect tribe, and fears not to
attack a creature, often above ten times its own mag|nitude.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the winter is pa&s;t, in the fir&s;t fine day in
April, the ant hill, that before &s;eemed a de&s;art, now &s;warms with new
life, and myriads of the&s;e in&s;ects are &s;een ju&s;t awaked from their
annual lethargy, and preparing for the plea&s;ures and fatigues of the
&s;ea&s;on. For the fir&s;t day they never offer to leave the hill, which may
be con&s;idered as their citadel, but run over every part of it, as if to
examine its pre&s;ent &s;ituation, to ob&s;erve what injuries it has
&s;u&s;tained during the rigours of winter,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Memoires pour &s;ervoir a l' Hi&s;toire des in&s;ectes par
Charles de Geer.</BIBL></NOTE> while they &s;lept, and to mediate and &s;ettle
the labours of the day en&s;uing.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t di&s;play of their forces, none but the
wingle&s;s tribe appears, while tho&s;e furni&s;h|ed with wings remain at the
bottom. The&s;e are the working ants, that fir&s;t appear, and that 
<PB N="118" REF="115"> are always de&s;titute of wings; the males and females,
that are furni&s;hed with four large wings each, are more &s;low in making
their ap|pearance.</P>
<P>Thus, like bees, they are divided into males, females, and the
neutral or the working tribe. The&s;e are all ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from
each other; the females are much larger than the males; the working ants are
the &s;malle&s;t of all. The two former have wings; which, however, they
&s;ometimes are dive&s;ted of; the latter never have any, and upon them are
devolved all the labours that tend to the welfare of the commu|nity. The
female, al&s;o, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed, by the colour and &s;tructure of her
brea&s;t, which is a little more brown, than that of the common ant, and a
little brighter than that of the male.</P>
<P>In eight or ten days after their fir&s;t appear|ance, the
labours of the hill are in &s;ome for|wardne&s;s; the males and females are
&s;een mix|ed with the working multitude, and pur&s;ued or pur&s;uing each
other. They &s;eem no way to partake in the common drugeries of the &s;tate;
the males pur&s;ue the females with great a&s;&s;iduity, and in a manner, force
them to compliance. They remain coupled for &s;ome time, while the males thus
united, &s;uffer them&s;elves to be drawn along by the will of their
partners.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="116">In the mean time, the working body of the
&s;tate take no part in their plea&s;ures, they are &s;een diligently going
from the ant-hill, in pur&s;uit of food for them&s;elves and their
a&s;&s;o|ciates, and of proper materials for giving a comfortable retreat to
their young, or &s;afety to their habitation. In the fields of England,
ant-hills are formed with but little apparent regularity. In the more
&s;outhern provinces of Europe, they are con&s;tructed with wonderful
contrivance, and offer a &s;ight highly worthy a naturali&s;t's curio&s;ity.
The&s;e are generally formed in the neighbourhood of &s;ome large tree and a
&s;tream of water. The one is con|&s;idered by the animals, as the proper place
for getting food; the other for &s;upplying them with moi&s;ture, which they
cannot well di&s;pen&s;e with. The &s;hape of the ant-hill, is that of a
&s;ugar loaf, about three feet high, compo&s;ed of various &s;ub&s;tances;
leaves, bits of wood, &s;and, earth, bits of gum, and grains of corn. The&s;e
are all united into a compact body, perforated with galleries down to the
bottom, and wind|ing ways within the body of the &s;tructure. From this
retreat, to the water, as well as to the tree, in different directions, there
are many paths worn by con&s;tant a&s;&s;iduity, and along the&s;e the bu&s;y
in&s;ects are &s;een pa&s;&s;ing and re|pa&s;&s;ing <PB N="120" REF="117">
continually; &s;o that from May, or the beginning of June, according to the
&s;tate of the &s;ea&s;on, they work continually, till the bad weather comes
on.</P>
<P>The chief employment of the working ants, is in &s;u&s;taining
not only the idlers at home, but al&s;o finding a &s;ufficiency of food for
them|&s;elves. They live upon various provi&s;ions, as well of the vegetable as
of the animal kind. Small in&s;ects they will kill and devour; &s;weets of all
kinds, they are particularly fond of. They &s;eldom, however, think of their
com|munity, till they them&s;elves are fir&s;t &s;atiated. Having found a juicy
fruit, they &s;wallow what they can, and then tearing it in pieces, carry home
their load. If they meet with an in&s;ect above their match, &s;everal of them
will fall upon it at once, and having mangled it, each will carry off a part of
the &s;poil. If they meet, in their excur&s;ions, any thing that is too heavy
for one to bear, and yet, which they are unable to divide, &s;everal of them
will endeavour to force it along; &s;ome dragging and others pu&s;h|ing. If any
one of them happens to make a lucky di&s;covery, it will immediately give
ad|vice to others, and then at once, the whole republic will put them&s;elves
in motion. If in the&s;e &s;truggles, one of them happens to be 
<PB N="121" REF="118"> killed, &s;ome kind &s;urvivor will carry him off to a
great di&s;tance, to prevent the ob&s;tructions his body may give to the
general &s;pirit of indu&s;try.</P>
<P>But while they are thus employed in &s;upport|ing the &s;tate,
in feeding abroad, and carrying in provi&s;ions to tho&s;e that continue at
home, they are not unmindful of po&s;terity. After a few days of fine weather,
the female ants begin to lay their eggs, and tho&s;e are as a&s;&s;idu|ou&s;ly
watched and protected by the working ants, who take upon them&s;elves to
&s;upply whatever is wanting to the na&s;cent animal's convenience or
nece&s;&s;ity. They are carried as &s;oon as laid, to the &s;afe&s;t
&s;ituation, at the bot|tom of their hill, where they are carefully de|fended
from cold and moi&s;ture. We are not to &s;uppo&s;e, that tho&s;e white
&s;ub&s;tances which we &s;o plentifully find in every ant-hill, are the eggs
as newly laid. On the contrary, the ant's egg is &s;o very &s;mall, that,
though laid upon a black ground, it can &s;carcely be di&s;cerned. The little
white bodies we &s;ee, are the young animals in their maggot &s;tate, endued
with life, long &s;ince freed from the egg, and often in|volved in a cone,
which it has &s;pun round it|&s;elf, like the &s;ilk worm. The real egg when
laid, if viewed through a micro&s;cope, appears &s;mooth, poli&s;hed and
&s;hining, while the mag|got <PB N="122" REF="119"> is &s;een compo&s;ed of
twelve rings, and is oftener larger than the ant it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the fond attach|ment which the
working ants &s;hew to their ri&s;ing progeny. In cold weather they take them
in their mouths, but without offering them the &s;malle&s;t injury, to the very
depths of their ha|bitation, where they are le&s;s &s;ubject to the &s;everity
of the &s;ea&s;on. In a fine day they re|move them, with the &s;ame care,
nearer the &s;ur|face, where their maturity may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the warm
beams of the &s;un. If a formidable enemy &s;hould come to batter down their
whole habitation, and cru&s;h them by thou&s;ands in the ruin, yet the&s;e
wonderful in&s;ects, &s;till mindful of their parental duties, make it their
fir&s;t care to &s;ave their offspring. They are &s;een running wildly about
and different ways, each loaded with a young one, often bigger than the
in&s;ect that &s;upports it. I have kept, &s;ays Swammer|dam, &s;everal of the
working ants in my clo&s;et, with their young, in a gla&s;s filled with earth.
I took plea&s;ure in ob&s;erving, that in proportion as the earth dried on the
&s;urface, they dug deeper and deeper to depo&s;ite their eggs; and when I
poured water thereon, it was &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee with what care, affection,
and diligence they laboured, to put their brood in &s;afety, in 
<PB N="123" REF="120"> the drie&s;t place. I have &s;een al&s;o, that when
water has been wanting for &s;everal days, and when the earth was moi&s;tened
after it a little, they immediately carried their young ones to have a &s;hare,
who &s;eemed to enjoy and &s;uck the moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>When the young maggot is come to its full growth, the brea&s;t
&s;wells in&s;en&s;ibly, it ca&s;ts its &s;kin, and lo&s;es all motion. All the
members which were hidden before, then begin to appear, an aurelia is formed,
which repre&s;ents very di&s;tinctly, all the parts of the animal, though they
are yet without mo|tion, and as it were, wrapped up in &s;waddling-cloaths.
When at length, the little in&s;ect has pa&s;&s;ed through all its changes, and
acquired its proper maturity, it bur&s;ts this la&s;t &s;kin, to a&s;|&s;ume
the form it is to retain ever after. Yet this is not done by the efforts of the
little ani|mal alone, for the old ones very a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly break open, with
their teeth, the covering in which it is enclo&s;ed. Without this
a&s;&s;i&s;tance the aurelia would never be able to get free, as Mr. De Geer
often found, who tried the expe|riment, by leaving the aurelia to them&s;elves.
The old ones not only a&s;&s;i&s;t them, but know the very preci&s;e time for
lending their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for if produced too &s;oon the young one dies
of <PB N="124" REF="121"> cold, if retarded too long it is &s;uffocated in its
pri&s;on.</P>
<P>When the female has done laying, and the whole brood is thus
produced, her labours, as well as that of the male, become unnece&s;&s;ary, and
her wings, which &s;he had but a &s;hort time before &s;o actively employed,
drop off. What becomes of her when thus dive&s;ted of her orna|ments is not
well known, for &s;he is &s;een in the cells for &s;ome weeks after. The males,
on the other hand, having no longer any occupation at home, make u&s;e of
tho&s;e wings with which they have been furni&s;hed by nature, and fly away,
never to return, or to be heard of more. It is probable they peri&s;h with the
cold, or are de|voured by the birds, which are particularly fond of this petty
prey.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the working ants having probably depo&s;ed
their queens, and being de|&s;erted by the males, that &s;erved but to clog the
community, prepare for the &s;everity of the win|ter, and bury their retreats
as deep in the earth as they conveniently can. It is now found that the grains
of corn, and other &s;ub&s;tances with which they furni&s;h their hill, are
only meant as fences to keep off the rigours of the weather, not as
provi&s;ions to &s;upport them during its con|tinuance. It is found generally
to obtain, that <PB N="125" REF="122"> every in&s;ect that lives a year after
it is come to its full growth, is obliged to pa&s;s four or five months without
taking any nouri&s;hment, and will &s;eem to be dead all that time. It would be
to no purpo&s;e therefore for ants to lay up corn for the winter, &s;ince they
lie that time without motion, heaped upon each other, and are &s;o far from
eating, that they are utterly unable to &s;tir. Thus what authors have
dignified by the name of a magazine, appears to be no more than a cavity, which
&s;erves for a common re|treat when the weather forces them to return to their
lethargic &s;tate.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid with exaggeration of the European ant, is
however true, if a&s;&s;erted of tho&s;e of the tropical climates. They build
an ant-hill with great contrivance and regularity, they lay up provi&s;ions,
and, as they probably live the whole year, they &s;ubmit them&s;elves to
regulations entirely unknown among the ants of Europe.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of Africa are of three kinds, the red, the green and the
black; the latter are above an inch long, and in every re&s;pect a mo&s;t
for|midable in&s;ect. Their &s;ting produces extreme pain, and their
depredations are &s;ometimes ex|tremely de&s;tructive. They build an ant-hill
of a very great &s;ize, from &s;ix to twelve feet high; <PB N="126" REF="123">
it is made of vi&s;cous clay, and tapers into a py|ramidal form. This
habitation is con&s;tructed with great artifice, and the cells are &s;o
nume|rous and even, that a honey-comb &s;carce ex|ceeds them in number and
regularity.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this edifice &s;eem to be un|der a very
&s;trict regulation. At the &s;lighte&s;t warning they will &s;ally out upon
whatever di&s;|turbs them, and if they have time to arre&s;t their enemies, he
is &s;ure to find no mercy. Sheep, hens, and even rats are often de&s;troyed by
the&s;e mercile&s;s in&s;ects, and their fle&s;h devoured to the bone. No
anatomi&s;t in the world can &s;trip a &s;keleton &s;o cleanly as they, and no
animal, how &s;trong &s;oever, when they have once &s;eized upon it, has power
to re&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>It often happens that the&s;e in&s;ects quit their retreat in a
body, and go in que&s;t of adventures. 
<Q REND="inline">"During my &s;tay," &s;ays Smith, "at Cape
Cor&s;e Ca&s;tle, a body of the&s;e ants came to pay us a vi&s;it in our
fortification. It was about day-break when the advanced guard of this
fami&s;hed crew entered the chapel, where &s;ome negroe &s;ervants were
a&s;leep upon the floor. The men were quickly alarmed at the inva&s;ion of this
unexpected army, and prepared, as well as they could, for a de|fence. While the
foremo&s;t battalion of in|&s;ects <PB N="127" REF="124"> had already taken
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, the rear guard was more than a quarter of a
mile di&s;tant. The whole ground &s;eemed alive and crawling with uncea&s;ing
de&s;truc|tion. After deliberating a few moments up|on what was to be done, it
was re&s;olved to lay a large train of gunpowder along the path they had taken,
by this means millions were blown to pieces, and the rear guard peceiv|ing the
de&s;truction of their leaders, thought proper in&s;tantly to return, and make
back to their original habitation."</Q></P>
<P>The order which the&s;e ants ob&s;erve, &s;eems very
extraordinary; whenever they &s;ally forth, fifty or &s;ixty larger than the
re&s;t are &s;een to head the band, and conduct them to their de&s;tined prey.
If they have a fixed &s;pot where their prey continues to re&s;ort to, they
then form a vaulted gallery, which is &s;ometimes a quarter of a mile in
length, and yet, they will hollow it out in the &s;pace of ten or twelve
hours.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Beetle and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have been treating of in|&s;ects with four
tran&s;parent wings, we now come to a tribe with two tran&s;parent wings, with
ca&s;es that cover them clo&s;e while at re&s;t, but which allow them their
proper play when fly|ing. The principal of the&s;e are the Beetle, the May Bug,
and the Cantharis. The&s;e are all bred like the re&s;t of their order, fir&s;t
from eggs, then they become grubs, then a chry&s;alis in which the parts of the
future fly are di&s;tinctly &s;een, and la&s;tly the animal leaves its
pri&s;on, breaking forth as a winged animal in full ma|turity.</P>
<P>Of the Beetle there are various kinds; all, however, concurring
in one common formation of having ca&s;es to their wings, which are the more
nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e in&s;ects, as they often live under the &s;urface of
the earth, in holes, which they dig out by their own indu&s;try. The&s;e
ca&s;es prevent the various injuries their real wings might &s;u&s;tain, by
rubbing or cru&s;hing again&s;t the &s;ides of their abode. The&s;e, though

<BYLINE>E. Martin sculp.</BYLINE>
</FIGURE> <PB N="129" REF="127"> they do not a&s;&s;i&s;t flight,
yet keep the internal wings clean and even, and produce a loud buzzing noi&s;e,
when the animal ri&s;es in the air.</P>
<P>If we examine the formation of all animals, of the beetle kind,
we &s;hall find, as in &s;hell-fi&s;h, that their bones are placed externally,
and their mu&s;cles within. The&s;e mu&s;cles are formed very much like tho&s;e
of quadrupedes, and are endued with &s;uch &s;urprizing &s;trength, that bulk
for bulk, they are a thou&s;and times &s;tronger than tho&s;e of a man. The
&s;trength of the&s;e mu&s;cles is of u&s;e in digging the animal's
&s;ubterraneous abode, where it is mo&s;t u&s;ually hatched, and to which it
mo&s;t frequently re|turns, even after it becomes a winged in&s;ect, capable of
flying.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the difference which re&s;ults from the &s;hape and
colour of the&s;e animals, the &s;ize al&s;o makes a con&s;iderable one; &s;ome
beetles being not larger than the head of a pin, while others, &s;uch as the
elephant beetle, are as big as ones fi&s;t: But the greate&s;t difference among
them is, that &s;ome are produced in a month, and in a &s;ingle &s;ea&s;on go
through all the &s;tages of their exi&s;tence, while others take near four
years to their production; and live as winged in&s;ects a year more. To give
the hi&s;tory of all the&s;e <PB N="130" REF="128"> animals, that are bred
pretty much in the &s;ame way, would be in&s;ipid and endle&s;s; it will
&s;uffice to &s;elect one or two from the number, the origin of which may
&s;erve as &s;pecimens of the re&s;t. I will, therefore, offer the hi&s;tory of
the may-bug to the reader's attention; pre|mi&s;ing, that mo&s;t other beetles,
though not &s;o long lived, are bred in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>The may-bug, or dorr-beetle, as &s;ome call it, has, like all
the re&s;t, a pair of ca&s;es to its wings, which are of a reddi&s;h brown
colour, &s;prinkled with a whiti&s;h du&s;t, which ea&s;ily comes off. In
&s;ome years their necks are &s;een covered with a red plate, and in others,
with a black; the&s;e, however, are di&s;tinct &s;orts, and their difference is
by no means accidental. The fore legs are very &s;hort, and the better
calculated for burrowing in the ground, where this in&s;ect makes its retreat.
It is well known for its evening buzz to children; but till more formidably
introduced to the acquaintance of hu&s;bandmen and gardeners, for in &s;ome
&s;ea&s;ons, it has been found to &s;warm in &s;uch numbers, as to eat up every
vegetable production.</P>
<P>The two &s;exes in the may-bug, are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed
from each other, by the &s;uperior length of the tufts, at the end of the
horns, in <PB N="131" REF="129"> the male. They begin to copulate in &s;ummer,
and at that &s;ea&s;on, they are &s;een joined together for a con&s;iderable
time. The female being im|pregnated, quickly falls to boring a hole into the
ground, where to depo&s;it her burthen. This is generally about half a foot
deep, and in it the places her eggs, which are of an oblong &s;hape, with great
regularity, one by the other. They are of a bright yellow colour, and no way
wrapped up in a common covering, as &s;ome have imagined. When the female is
lightened of her burthen, &s;he again a&s;cends from her hole, to live as
before, upon leaves and ve|getables, to buzz in the &s;ummer evening, and to
lie hid, among the branches of trees, in the heat of the day.</P>
<P>In about three months after the&s;e eggs have been thus
depo&s;ited in the earth, the contain|ed in&s;ect begins to break its &s;hell,
and a &s;mall grub or maggot crawls forth, and feeds upon the roots of whatever
vegetable it happens to be neare&s;t. All &s;ub&s;tances, of this kind, &s;eem
equally grateful, yet it is probable the mother in&s;ect has a choice among
what kind of veget|ables &s;he &s;hall depo&s;it her young. In this manner
the&s;e voracious creatures continue in the worm &s;tate, for more than three
years, devouring the roots of every plant they ap|proach, <PB N="132" REF="130"> and making their way under ground, in que&s;t of food, with great
di&s;patch and facility. At length they grow to above the &s;ize of a walnut,
being a great thick white maggot with a red head, which is &s;een mo&s;t
frequently in new turned earth, and which is &s;o eagerly &s;ought after by
birds of every &s;pecies. When large&s;t, they are found an inch and an half
long, of a whiti&s;h yellow colour, with a body con&s;i&s;ting of twelve
&s;eg|ments or joints, on each &s;ide of which, there are nine breathing holes,
and three red feet. The head is large, in proportion to the body, of a
reddi&s;h colour, with a pincer before, and a &s;emi-circular lip, with which
it cuts the roots of plants, and &s;ucks out their moi&s;ture. As this in&s;ect
lives entirely under ground, it has no occa&s;ion for eyes, and accordingly it
is found to have none; but is furni&s;hed with two feelers, which, like the
crutch of a blind man, &s;erve to direct its motions. Such is the form of this
animal, that lives for years in the worm &s;tate under ground, &s;till
voracious, and every year changing its &s;kin.</P>
<P>It is not till the end of the fourth year, that this
extraordinary in&s;ect prepares to emerge from its &s;ubterraneous abode, and
even this is not effected, but by a tedious preparation. <PB N="133" REF="131">
About the latter end of autumn, the grub be|gins to perceive the approaches of
its tran&s;for|mation, it then buries it&s;elf deeper and deeper in the earth,
&s;ometimes &s;ix feet beneath the &s;urface, and there forms it&s;elf a
capacious apartment, the walls of which it renders very &s;mooth and &s;hining,
by the excretions of its body. Its abode being thus formed, it begins &s;oon
after, to &s;horten it&s;elf, to &s;well, and to bur&s;t its la&s;t &s;kin, in
order to a&s;&s;ume the form of a chry&s;alis. This, in the beginning, appears
of a yellowi&s;h colour, which heightens by de|grees, till at la&s;t, it is
&s;een nearly red. Its exterior form plainly di&s;covers all the ve&s;tiges of
the future winged in&s;ect, all the fore parts being di&s;tinctly &s;een; while
behind, the animal &s;eems as if wrapped in &s;waddling cloaths.</P>
<P>The young may-bug continues in this &s;tate for about three
months longer, and it is not till the beginning of January, that the aurelia
dive&s;ts it&s;elf of all its impediments, and be|comes a winged in&s;ect,
completely formed. Yet &s;till the animal is far from attaining its natural
&s;trength, health, and appetite. It un|dergoes a kind of infant imbecillity,
and unlike mo&s;t other in&s;ects, that the in&s;tant they become flies are
arrived at their &s;tate of full perfection, the may-bug continues feeble and
&s;ickly. <PB N="134" REF="132"> Its colour is much brighter than in the
perfect animal, all its parts are &s;oft, and its voracious nature &s;eems for
a while, to have entirely for|&s;aken it. As the animal is very often found in
this &s;tate, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, by tho&s;e unacquainted with its real
hi&s;tory, that the old ones, of the former &s;ea&s;on, have buried
them&s;elves for the winter, in order to revi&s;it the &s;un the en&s;uing
&s;ummer. But the fact is, the old one never &s;urvives the &s;ea&s;on but
dies, like all the other winged tribe of in&s;ects, from the &s;everity of cold
in winter.</P>
<P>About the latter end of May, the&s;e in&s;ects, after having
lived for four years under ground, bur&s;t from the earth, when the fir&s;t
mild even|ing invites them abroad. They are at that time &s;een ri&s;ing from
their long impri&s;onment, from living only upon roots, and imbibing only the
moi&s;ture of the earth, to vi&s;it the mildne&s;s of the &s;ummer air, to
chu&s;e the &s;weete&s;t vegetables for their banquet, and to drink the dew of
the evening. Wherever an attentive ob&s;erver then walks abroad, he will &s;ee
them bur&s;ting up before him in his pathway, like gho&s;ts on a theatre. He
will &s;ee every part of the earth, that had its &s;urface beaten into
hardne&s;s, per|forated by their egre&s;&s;ion. When the &s;ea&s;on is
favourable for them, they are &s;een by myriads <PB N="135" REF="133"> buzzing
along, hitting again&s;t every object that intercepts their flight. The mid-day
&s;un, how|ever, &s;eems too powerful for their con&s;titu|tions; they then
lurk under the leaves and branches of &s;ome &s;hady tree; but the willow
&s;eems particularly, their mo&s;t favourite food; there they lurk in
clu&s;ters, and &s;eldom quit the tree till they have devoured all its
ver|dure. In tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, which are favourable to their propagation,
they are &s;een in an even|ing as thick as flakes of &s;now, and hitting
again&s;t every object with a &s;ort of capricious blindne&s;s. Their duration,
however, is but &s;hort, as they never &s;urvive the &s;ea&s;on. They begin to
join &s;hortly after they have been let loo&s;e from their pri&s;on, and when
the female is impregnated, the cautiou&s;ly bores a hole in the ground, with an
in&s;trument fitted for that purpo&s;e, which the is furni&s;hed with at the
tail, and there depo&s;its her eggs, generally to the number of three&s;core.
If the &s;ea&s;on and the &s;oil be adapted to their propagation, the&s;e
&s;oon multiply as already de&s;cribed, and go through their noxious &s;tages
of their contemp|tible exi&s;tence. This in&s;ect, however, in its worm
&s;tate, though prejudicial to man, makes one of the chief repa&s;ts of the
feathered tribe, and is generally the fir&s;t nouri&s;hment with 
<PB N="136" REF="134"> which they &s;upply their young: Rooks, and hogs are
particularly fond of the&s;e worms, and de|vour them in great numbers. The
inhabitants of the county of Norfolk, &s;ome time &s;ince, went into the
practice of de&s;troying their rookeries, but in proportion, as they
de&s;troyed one plague, they were pe&s;tered with greater; and the&s;e
in&s;ects multiplied in &s;uch an amazing abundance, as to de&s;troy not only
the verdure of the fields, but even the roots of vegetables, not yet &s;hot
forth. One farm in particular was &s;o injured by them in the year 1751, that
the occupier was not able to pay his rent, and the landlord was not only
content to lo&s;e his income for that year, but al&s;o gave money for the
&s;up|port of the farmer and his family. In Ireland they &s;uffered &s;o much
by the&s;e in&s;ects, that they came to a re&s;olution of &s;etting fire to a
wood, of &s;ome miles in extent, to prevent their mi&s;chievous
propagation.</P>
<P>Of all the beetle kind this is the mo&s;t nume|rous, and
therefore de&s;erves the chief attention of hi&s;tory. The numerous varieties
of other kinds, might repay the curio&s;ity of the diligent ob&s;erver, but we
mu&s;t be content in general to ob&s;erve, that in the great out-lines of the
hi&s;tory, they re&s;emble tho&s;e of which we have ju&s;t been giving a
de&s;cription; like them, all <PB N="137" REF="135"> other beetles are bred
from the egg, which is depo&s;ited in the ground, or &s;ometimes, tho'
&s;eldom, in the barks of trees, they change into a worm; they &s;ub&s;i&s;t in
that &s;tate by living up|on the roots of vegetables, or the &s;ucculent parts
of the bark round them. They generally live a year at lea&s;t before they
change into an aurelia; in that &s;tate they are, not entirely mo|tionle&s;s,
nor intirely &s;waddled up without form.</P>
<P>It would be tedious and endle&s;s to give a de&s;cription of
all, and yet it would be an un|pardonable omi&s;&s;ion not to mention the
parti|cularities of &s;ome beetles, which are &s;ingular rather from their
&s;ize, their manners, or their formation. That beetle which the Americans call
the tumble-dung, particularly demands our attention; it is all over of a
du&s;ky black, rounder than tho&s;e animals are generally found to be, and &s;o
&s;trong, tho' not much larger than the common black beetle, that if one of
them be put under a bra&s;s candle&s;tick, it will cau&s;e it to move backwards
and forwards, as if it were by an invi&s;ible hand, to the admiration of
tho&s;e who are not accu&s;tomed to the &s;ight; but this &s;trength is given
it for much more u&s;e|ful purpo&s;es than tho&s;e of exciting human
curi|o&s;ity, for there is no creature more laborious, either in &s;eeking
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or in providing a <PB N="138" REF="136"> proper retreat for
its young. They are endow|ed with &s;agacity to di&s;cover &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by
their excellent &s;melling, which directs them in flights to excrements ju&s;t
fallen from man or bea&s;t, on which they in&s;tantly drop, and fall
unanimou&s;ly to work in forming round balls or pellets there|of, in the middle
of which they lay an egg. The&s;e pellets, in September, they convey three feet
deep in the earth, where they lye till the approach of &s;pring, when the eggs
are hatched and burnt their ne&s;ts, and the in&s;ects find their way out of
the earth. They a&s;&s;i&s;t each other with indefatigable indu&s;try, in
rolling the&s;e globular pellets to the place where they are to be buried. This
they are to perform with the tail foremo&s;t, by rai&s;ing up their hinder
part, and &s;hoving along the ball with their hind-feet. They are always
accompanied with other beetles of a larger &s;ize, and of a more elegant
&s;tructure and colour. The brea&s;t of this is covered with a &s;hield of a
crim&s;on co|lour, and &s;hining-like metal; the head is of the like colour,
mixed with green, and on the crown of the head &s;tands a &s;hining black horn,
bended backwards. The&s;e are called the kings of the beetles, but for what
rea&s;on is uncer|tain, &s;ince they partake of the &s;ame dirty drud|gery with
the re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="137">The Elephant-beetle is the large&s;t of
this kind hitherto known, and is found in South-America, particularly Guiana
and Surinam, as well as a|bout the river Oroonoko. It is of a black co|lour,
and the whole body is covered with a very hard &s;hell, full as thick and as
&s;trong as that of a &s;mall crab. Its length, from the hinder part to the
eyes, is almo&s;t four inches, and from the &s;ame part to the end of the
probo&s;cis, or trunk, four inches and three quarters. The tran&s;ver&s;e
dia|meter of the body is two inches and a quarter, and the breadth of each
elytron, or ca&s;e for the wings, is an inch and three tenths. The an|tennae or
feelers, are quite horny; for which rea&s;on the probo&s;cis or trunk is
moveable at its in&s;ertion into the head, and &s;eems to &s;up|ply the place
of feelers. The horns are eight tenths of an inch long, and terminate in
points. The probo&s;cis is an inch and a quarter long, and turns upwards,
making a crooked line, terminating in two horns, each of which is near a
quarter of an inch long; but they are not perforated at the end like the
probo&s;cis of other in&s;ects. About four tenths of an inch above the head, or
that &s;ide next the body, is a prominence, or &s;mall horn, which if the
re&s;t of the trunk were away, would cau&s;e this part to re&s;emble the horn
of a rhinoceros. There is <PB N="140" REF="138"> indeed a beetle &s;o called,
but then the horns or trunk has no fork at, the end, though the lower horn
re&s;embles this. The feet are all forked at the end, but not like lob&s;ters
claws.</P>
<P>To this cla&s;s we may al&s;o refer the glow-worm, that little
animal which makes &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure in the de&s;criptions of
our poets. No two in&s;ects can differ more than the male and female of this
&s;pecies from each other. The male is in every re&s;pect a beetle, having
ca&s;es to its wings, and ri&s;ing in the air at plea&s;ure; the female, on the
contrary has none, but is entirely a creeping in&s;ect, and is obliged to wait
the approaches of her capri|cious companion. The body of the female has eleven
joints, with a &s;hield brea&s;t-plate, the &s;hape of which is oval; the head
is placed over this, and is very &s;mall, and the three la&s;t joints of her
body are of a yellowi&s;h colour; but what di&s;tingui&s;hes it from all other
animals, at lea&s;t in this part of the world, is the &s;hining light which it
emits by night, and which is &s;uppo&s;ed by force philo&s;ophers, to be an
emanation which &s;he &s;ends forth to allure the male to her com|pany. Mo&s;t
travellers who have gone through &s;andy countries, mu&s;t well remember the
little &s;hining &s;parks with which the ditches are &s;tud|ded on each &s;ide
of the road. If incited by <PB N="141" REF="139"> curio&s;ity to approach more
nearly, he will find the light &s;ent forth by the glow-worm; if he &s;hould
keep the little animal for &s;ome time, its light continues to grow paler, and
at la&s;t ap|pears totally extinct: The manner in which this light is produced
has hitherto continued inexplicable; it is probable the little animal is
&s;upplied with &s;ome electrical powers, &s;o that by rubbing the joints of
its body again&s;t each other, it thus &s;upplies a &s;tream of light which if
it allures the male, as we are told, &s;erves for very u&s;eful purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The cantharis is of the beetle kind, from whence come
cantharides, well known in the chops by the name of Spani&s;h flies, and for
their u&s;e in bli&s;ters. They have feelers like bri&s;tles, flexible ca&s;es
to the wings, a brea&s;t pretty plain, and the &s;ides of the belly wrink|led.
Cantharides differ from each other in their &s;ize, &s;hape, and colour,
tho&s;e u&s;ed in the &s;hops al&s;o do the &s;ame. The large&s;t in the&s;e
parts are about an inch long, and as much in cir|cumference, but others are not
above three quarters of an inch. Some are of a pure azure colour, others of
pure gold, and others again, have a mixture of pure gold and azure colours; but
they are all very brilliant, and extremely beautiful. The&s;e in&s;ects, as is
well <PB N="142" REF="140"> known, are of the greate&s;t benefit to mankind,
making a part in many medicines conducive to human pre&s;ervation. They are
chiefly natives of Spain, Italy, and Portugal; but they are to be met with
al&s;o about Paris in the &s;ummer time, upon the leaves of the a&s;h, the
poplar, and the ro&s;e-trees, and al&s;o among wheat, and in meadows. It is
very certain, that the&s;e in|&s;ects are fond of a&s;h leaves, in&s;omuch that
they will &s;ometimes &s;trip one of the&s;e trees quite bare. Some affirm,
that the&s;e flies de|light in &s;weet-&s;melling herbs, and it is very
certain, that they are fond of honey-&s;uckles, liloc, and wild-cherry
&s;hrubs; but &s;ome that have &s;ought after them declare, they never could
find them on elder-trees, nut-trees, and among wheat. We are told, that the
country people expect the return of the&s;e in&s;ects every &s;even years. It
is very certain, that &s;uch a num|ber of the&s;e in&s;ects have been &s;een
together in the air, that they appeared like &s;warms of bees; and that they
have &s;o di&s;agreeable a &s;mell, that it may be perceived a great way off,
e&s;pecially about &s;un-&s;et, though they are not &s;een at that time. This
bad &s;mell is a guide for tho&s;e who make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to catch
them. When they are caught they dry them, after which they are &s;o light, that
fifty will hardly weigh a <PB N="143" REF="141"> dram. Tho&s;e that gather
them, tie them in a bag, or a piece of linnen cloth, that has been well worn,
and then they kill them with the vapours of hot vinegar; after which they dry
them in the &s;un, and keep them in boxes. The&s;e flies, thus dried, being
chymically ana|ly&s;ed, yield a great deal of volatile cau&s;tic-&s;alt, mixed
with a little oil, phlegm and earth. Cantharides are penetrating, corro&s;ive,
and ap|plied to the &s;kin, rai&s;e bli&s;ters, from whence proceeds a great
deal of &s;ero&s;ity. They are made u&s;e of both inwardly and outwardly.
However it is &s;omewhat &s;trange that the effects of the&s;e flies &s;hould
fall principally upon the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, for though &s;ome authors have
endeavoured to account for this, we are mill in the dark, for all they have
&s;aid amounts to no more, than that they affect the&s;e parts in a manner
which may be very learnedly de&s;cribed, but very ob&s;curely comprehended.</P>
<P>An in&s;ect of great, tho' perhaps not equal u&s;e in medicine,
is that which is known by the name of the kermes; it is produced in the
ex|cre&s;cence of an oak, called the berry-bearing ilex, and appears at fir&s;t
wrapt up in a membranaceous bladder, of the &s;ize of a pea, &s;mooth and
&s;hining of a browni&s;h red colour, and covered with a very fine
a&s;h-coloured pow|der. <PB N="144" REF="142"> This bag teems with a number of
reddi&s;h eggs or in&s;ects, which being rubbed with the fingers pour out a
crim&s;on liquor. It is only met with in warm countries in the months of May
and June. In the month of April this in&s;ect becomes of the &s;ize and &s;hape
of a pea, and its eggs &s;ome time after bur&s;t from the womb, and &s;oon
turning worms, run about the branches and leaves of the tree. They are of two
&s;exes, and the females have been hitherto de&s;cribed; but the males are very
di&s;tinct from the former, and are a &s;ort of &s;mall flies like gnats, with
&s;ix feet, of which the four forward are &s;hort, and the two backward long,
divided into four joints, and armed with three crooked nails. There are two
feelers on the head, a line and a half long, which are moveable, &s;treaked and
articulated. The tail, at the back part of the body, is half a line long, and
forked. The whole body is covered with two tran&s;parent wings, and they leap
about in the manner of fleas. The har|ve&s;t of the kermes is greater or le&s;s
in propor|tion to the &s;everity of the winter, and the wo|men gather them
before &s;un-ri&s;ing, tearing them off with their nails; for fear there
&s;hould be any lo&s;s from the hatching of the in&s;ects. They &s;prinkle them
with vinegar, and lay them in the &s;un to dry, where they acquire a red
colour.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="143">An in&s;ect, perhaps, &s;till more
u&s;eful than, either of the former, is the cochineal, which has been very
variou&s;ly de&s;cribed by authors; &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed it a vegetable
excre&s;cence from the tree upon which it is found; &s;ome have de&s;cribed it
as a lou&s;e, &s;ome as a bug, and &s;ome as a beetle. As they appear in our
&s;hops when brought from America, they are of an irre|gular &s;hape, convex on
one &s;ide, and a little concave on the other; but are both marked with
tran&s;ver&s;e &s;treaks or wrinkles. They are of a &s;carlet colour within,
and without of a blacki&s;h red, and &s;ometimes of a white, reddi&s;h, or
a&s;h-colour, which are accounted the be&s;t, and are brought to us from
Mexico. The cochineal in&s;ect is of an oval form, of the &s;ize of a &s;mall
pea, with &s;ix feet, and a &s;nout or trunk. It brings forth its young alive,
and is nouri&s;hed by &s;ucking the juice of the plant. Its body con&s;i&s;ts
of &s;everal rings, and when it is once fixed on the plant, it continues
immove|able, being &s;ubject to no change. Some pre|tend there are two &s;orts,
the one dome&s;tic, which is be&s;t, and the other wild, that is of a vivid
colour; however they appear to be the &s;ame, only with this difference, that
the Wild feeds upon uncultivated trees, without any a&s;&s;i&s;|tance, whereas
the dome&s;tic is carefully at a <PB N="146" REF="144"> &s;tated &s;ea&s;on,
removed to cultivated trees, where it feeds upon a purer juice. Tho&s;e who
take care of the&s;e in&s;ects, place them on the prickly pear plant in a
certain order, and are very indu&s;trious in defending them from other
in&s;ects; for if any other kind come among them, they take care to bru&s;h
them off with foxes tails. Towards the end of the year, when the rains and cold
weather are coming on, which are fatal to the&s;e in&s;ects, they take off the
leaves or branches covered with cochineal, that have not attained their
utmo&s;t degree of perfection, and keep them in their hou&s;es till winter is
pa&s;t. The&s;e leaves are very thick and juicy, and &s;upply them with
&s;ufficient nouri&s;h|ment, while they remain within doors. When the milder
weather returns, and the&s;e animals are about to exclude their young, the
natives make them ne&s;ts, like tho&s;e of birds, but le&s;s, of tree-mo&s;s,
or &s;oft hay, or the down of co|coa-nuts, placing twelve in every ne&s;t.
The&s;e they fix on the thorns of the prickly pear-plant, and in three or four
days time they bring forth their young, which leave their ne&s;ts in a few
days, and creep upon the branches of the plant, till they find a proper place
to re&s;t in, and take in their nouri&s;hment; and until the fe|males are
&s;ecundated by the males, which, as <PB N="147" REF="145"> in the former
tribe, differ very widely, from the females being winged in&s;ects, whereas the
others only creep, and are at mo&s;t &s;tationary. When they are impregnated,
they produce a new offspring, so that the propagator has a new harve&s;t thrice
a year. When the native Americans have gathered the cochineal, they put them
into holes in the ground, where they kill them with boiling water, and
afterwards dry them in the &s;un, or in an oven, or lay them upon hot plates.
From the various me|thods of killing them, ari&s;e the different co|lours which
they appear in when brought to us. While they are living, they &s;eem to be
&s;prinkled over with a white powder, which they lo&s;e as &s;oon as the
boiling water is poured upon them. Tho&s;e that are dried upon hot places are
the blacke&s;t. What we call the co|chineal are only the females, for the males
are a &s;ort of fly as already ob&s;erved in the kermes. They are u&s;ed both
for dyeing and medicine, and are &s;aid to have much the &s;ame virtue as the
ker|mes, tho' they are now &s;eldom u&s;ed alone, but are mixed with other
things for the &s;ake of the colour.</P>
<P>I shall end this account of the beetle tribe with the hi&s;tory
of an animal which cannot pro|perly be ranked under this &s;pecies, and yet
which cannot be more methodically ranged under <PB N="148" REF="146"> any
other. This is the in&s;ect that forms and re&s;ides in the gall-nut, the
&s;poils of which are converted to &s;uch u&s;eful purpo&s;es. The gall
in&s;ects are bred in a &s;ort of bodies adhering to a kind of oak in A&s;ia,
which differ with regard to their colour, &s;ize, roughne&s;s, &s;moothne&s;s
and &s;hape, and which we call galls. They are not fruit, as &s;ome have
imagined, but preternatural tumours, owing to the wounds given to the buds,
leaves, and twigs of the tree, by a kind of in&s;ects that lay their eggs
within them. This animal is furni&s;hed with an implement, by which the female
penetrates into the bark of the tree, or into that &s;pot which ju&s;t begins
to bud, and there &s;heds a drop of corro&s;ive fluid into the cavity. Having
thus formed a recepta|cle for her eggs, &s;he depo&s;ites them in the place,
and dies &s;oon after. The heart of the bud be|ing thus wounded, the
circulation of the nu|tritive juice is interrupted and the fermentation
thereof, with the poi&s;on injected by the fly, burns the parts adjacent, and
then alters the natural colour of the plant. The juice or &s;ap turned bark
from its natural cour&s;e, extrava&s;ates and flows round the egg. After which
it &s;wells and dilates by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome bubbles of air, which
get admi&s;&s;ion through the pores of the bark, and which run in the
ve&s;&s;els with the &s;ap. <PB N="149" REF="147"> The external coat of this
excre&s;cence is dried by the air, and grows into a figure which bears &s;ome
re&s;emblance to the bow of an arch, or the roundne&s;s of a kernel. This
little ball receives its nutriment, growth and vegetation as the other parts of
the tree by &s;low degrees, and is what we call the gall-nut. The worm that is
hatched un|der this &s;pacious vault, finds in the &s;ub&s;tance of the ball,
which is as yet very tender, a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence &s;uitable to its nature;
gnaws and dige&s;ts it till the time comes for its tran&s;formation to a nymph,
and from that &s;tate of exi&s;tence changes into a fly. After this the
in&s;ect, perceiving it|&s;elf duly provided with all things requi&s;ite,
di&s;|engages it&s;elf &s;oon from its confinement, and takes its flight into
the open air. The ca&s;e how|ever, is not &s;imilar with re&s;pect to the
gall-nut, that grows in autumn. The cold weather fre|quently comes on before
the worm is tran&s;form|ed into a fly, or before the fly can pierce through its
inclo&s;ure. The nut falls with the leaves, and altho' you may imagine that the
fly which lies within is lo&s;t, yet in reality it is not &s;o; on the
contrary, its being covered up &s;o clo&s;e, is the means of its
pre&s;ervation. Thus it &s;pends the winter in a warm hou&s;e, where every
crack and cranny of the nut is well &s;topped up; and lies buried as it were
under a heap of leaves, <PB N="150" REF="148"> which pre&s;erves it from the
injuries of the weather. This apartment, however, tho' &s;o commodious a
retreat in the winter, is a per|fect pri&s;on in the &s;pring. The fly, rouzed
out of its lethargy by the fir&s;t heats, breaks its way through, and ranges
where it plea&s;es. A very &s;mall aperture is &s;ufficient &s;ince at this
time the fly is but a diminutive crea|ture. Be&s;ides, the ringlets whereof its
body is compo&s;ed, dilate, and become pliant is the pa&s;&s;age.</P>

<PB N="151" REF="149">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Gnat and the Tipula.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two in&s;ects which entirely re|&s;emble each other in
their form, and yet widely differ in their habits, manners and propaga|tion.
Tho&s;e who have &s;een the tipula, or long-legs, and the larger kind of gnat,
have mo&s;t probably mi&s;taken the one for the other, they have often
accu&s;ed the tipula, a harmle&s;s in&s;ect, of depredations made by the gnat,
and the innocent have &s;uffered for the guilty; in|deed the differences in
their form are &s;o very minute, that it often requires the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
a micro&s;cope to di&s;tingui&s;h the one from the other: they are both mounted
on long legs, both furni&s;hed with two wings and a &s;lender body; their heads
are large, and they &s;eem to be hump-backed; the chief and only difference,
therefore, is, that the tipula wants a trunk, while the gnat has a large one,
which it often exerts to very mi&s;chievous purpo&s;es. The tipula is a
harmle&s;s peaceful in&s;ect, that offers injury to nothing; the gnat is
&s;anguinary and <PB N="152" REF="150"> predaceous, ever &s;eeking out for a
place in which to bury its trunk, and pumping up the blood from the animal in
large quantities.</P>
<P>The gnat proceeds from a little worm, which is u&s;ually &s;een
at the bottom of &s;tanding waters. The manner in which the in&s;ect lays its
eggs is particularly curious; after having laid the pro|per number on the
&s;urface of the water, it &s;ur|rounds them with a kind of unctuous matter,
which prevents them from &s;inking; but at the &s;ame time fa&s;tens them with
a thread to the bottom, to prevent their floating away, at the mercy of every
breeze, from a place the warmth of which is proper for their production, to any
other, where the water may be too cold, or the animals its enemies too
numerous. Thus the in&s;ects, in their egg &s;tate, re&s;emble a buoy, which is
fixed by an anchor. As they come to maturity they &s;ink deeper, and at la&s;t,
when they leave the egg as worms they creep at the bottom. They now make
them&s;elves lodg|ments of cement, which they fa&s;ten to &s;ome &s;olid body
at the very bottom of the water, unle&s;s, by accident, they meet with a piece
of chalk, which being of a &s;oft and pliant nature, gives them an opportunity
of &s;inking a retreat for them&s;elves, where nothing but the claws of a
cray-fi&s;h can po&s;&s;ibly mole&s;t them. The worm <PB N="153" REF="151">
afterwards changes its form. It appears with a large head, and a tail
inve&s;ted with hair, and moi&s;tened with an oleaginous liquor, which &s;he
makes u&s;e of as a cork, to &s;u&s;tain her head in the air, and her tail in
the water, and to tran|&s;port her from one place to another. When the oil with
which her tail is moi&s;tened begins to grow dry, &s;he di&s;charges out of her
mouth an unctuous humour, which &s;he &s;heds all over her tail, by virtue
whereof, &s;he is enabled to-tran&s;port her&s;elf where &s;he plea&s;es,
without be|ing either wet or any ways incommoded by the water. The gnat, in her
&s;econd &s;tate, is pro|perly &s;peaking, in her form of a nymph, which is an
introduction, or entrance into a new life. In the fir&s;t place, the diverts
her&s;elf of her &s;e|cond &s;kin; in the next &s;he re&s;igns her eyes, her
antennae, and her tail; in &s;hort, &s;he actually &s;eems to expire. However,
from the &s;poils of the amphibious animal, a little winged in&s;ect cuts the
air, who&s;e every part is active to the la&s;t de|gree, and who&s;e whole
&s;tructure is the ju&s;t ob|ject of our admiration. Its little head is
adorn|ed with a plume of feathers, and its whole body inve&s;ted with &s;cales
and hair, to &s;ecure it from any wet or du&s;t. She makes trial of the
activity of her wings, by rubbing them either again&s;t her body, or her broad
&s;ide-bags, <PB N="154" REF="152"> which keep her in an equilibrium. The
fur|below, or little border of fine feathers, which graces her wings is very
curious, and &s;trikes the eye in the mo&s;t agreeable manner. There is
nothing, however, of greater importance to the gnat, than her trunk, and that
weak imple|ment may ju&s;tly be deemed one of nature's ma&s;ter-pieces. It is
&s;o very &s;mall, that the extremity of it can &s;carcely be di&s;cerned
through the be&s;t micro&s;cope that can be procured. That part which is at
fir&s;t obvious to the eye, is nothing but a long &s;caly &s;heath under the
throat. At near the di&s;tance of two thirds of it, there is an aperture,
through which the in|&s;ect darts out four &s;tings, and afterwards retracts
them. One of which, however &s;harp and ac|tive it may be, is no more than the
ca&s;e in which the other three lie concealed, and run in a long groove. The
&s;ides of the&s;e &s;tings are &s;harpened like two-edged &s;words; they are
likewi&s;e barbed, and have a va&s;t number of cutting teeth towards the point,
which turns up like a hook, and is fine beyond expre&s;&s;ion. When all the&s;e
darts are &s;tuck into the fle&s;h of animals, &s;ometimes one after another,
and &s;ometimes all at once, the blood and humours of the adjacent parts mu&s;t
unavoidably be ex|trava&s;ated; upon which a tumour mu&s;t con&s;e|quently 
<PB N="155" REF="153"> en&s;ue, the little orifice whereof is clo&s;ed up by
the compre&s;&s;ion of the external air. When the gnat, by the point of her
ca&s;e, which &s;he makes u&s;e of as a tongue, has ta&s;ted any fruit,
fle&s;h, or juice, that &s;he has found out; if it be a fluid, &s;he &s;ucks it
up, without play|ing her darts into it; but in ca&s;e &s;he finds the lea&s;t
ob&s;truction by any fle&s;h whatever, &s;he ex|erts her &s;trength, and
pierces through it, if po&s;&s;ibly &s;he can. After this &s;he draws back her
&s;tings into their &s;heath, which &s;he applies to the wound in order to
extract, as through a reed, the juices which &s;he finds inclo&s;ed. This is
the implement with which the gnat performs her work in the &s;ummer, for during
the winter the has no manner of occa&s;ion for it. Then &s;he cea&s;es to eat,
and &s;pends all that tedious &s;ea&s;on either in quarries or in caverns,
which &s;he abandons at the return of &s;ummer, and flies about in &s;earch
after &s;ome commodious ford, or &s;tanding water, where &s;he may produce her
progeny, which would be &s;oon wa&s;hed a|way and lo&s;t, by the too rapid
motion of any running &s;tream. The little brood are &s;ome|times &s;o
numerous, that the very water is tin|ged according to the colour of the
&s;pecies, as green, if they be green, and of a &s;anguine hue, if they be
red.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="154">The&s;e are circum&s;tances &s;ufficiently
extraor|dinary in the life of this little animal, but it offers &s;omething
&s;till more curious in the me|thod of its propagation. However &s;imilar
in|&s;ects of the gnat kind are in their appearance, yet they differ widely
from each other in the manner in which they are brought forth, for &s;ome are
ovi|parous, and are produced from eggs, &s;ome are viviparous, and come forth
in their mo&s;t per|fect form; &s;ome are males, and unite with the female;
&s;ome are females, requiring the im|pregnation of the male; &s;ome are of
neither &s;ex, yet &s;till produce young, without any copu|lation what&s;oever.
This is one of the &s;trange&s;t di&s;coveries in all natural hi&s;tory! A gnat
&s;e|parated from the re&s;t of its kind, and inclo&s;ed in a gla&s;s
ve&s;&s;el, with air &s;ufficient to keep it alive, &s;hall produce young,
which al&s;o, when &s;eparated from each other, &s;hall be the parents of a
numerous progeny. Thus, down for five or &s;ix generations do the&s;e
extraordinary animals propagate without the u&s;e of copulation, with|out any
congre&s;s between the male and female, but in the manner of vegetables, the
young bur&s;ting from the body of their parents, without any previous
impregnation. At the &s;ixth genera|tion however, their propagation &s;tops,
the gnat no longer produces its like, from it&s;elf <PB N="157" REF="155">
alone, but it requires the acce&s;s of the male to give it another
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ecundity.</P>
<P>The gnat of Europe gives but little unea&s;i|ne&s;s; it is
&s;ometimes heard to hum about our beds at night, and keeps off the approaches
of &s;leep by the apprehen&s;ion it cau&s;es; but it is very different in the
ill-peopled regions of America, where the waters &s;tagnate, and the climate is
warm, and where they are produced in multitudes beyond expre&s;&s;ion. The
whole air is there filled with clouds of tho&s;e fami&s;hed in&s;ects; and they
are found of all &s;izes, from &s;ix inches long, to a minutene&s;s that even
re|quires the micro&s;cope to have a di&s;tinct percep|tion of them. The warmth
of the mid-day &s;un is too powerful for their con&s;titutions; but when the
evening approaches, neither art nor flight can &s;hield the wretched
inhabitants from their at|tacks, tho' millions are de&s;troyed, &s;till
millions more &s;ucceed, and produce uncea&s;ing torment. The native Indians,
who anoint their bodies with oil, and who have from their infancy been u&s;ed
to their depredations, find them much le&s;s inconvenient than tho&s;e who are
newly ar|rived from Europe; they &s;leep in their cot|tages covered all over
with thou&s;ands of the gnat kind upon their bodies, and yet do not &s;eem to
have their &s;lumbers interrupted by <PB N="158" REF="156"> their cruel
devourers. If a candle happens to be lighted in one of tho&s;e places, a cloud
of in&s;ects at once light upon the flame, and extingui&s;h it; they are
therefore obliged to keep their candles in gla&s;s lanthorns; a mi|&s;erable
expedient to prevent an uncea&s;ing calamity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of Zoophytes in General.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now come to the la&s;t link in the chain of animated
nature, to a cla&s;s of beings &s;o confined in their powers, and &s;o
defective in their formation, that &s;ome hi&s;torians have been at a lo&s;s
whether to con&s;ider them as a &s;uperior rank of vegetables, or the
humble&s;t order of the animated tribe. In order therefore to give them a
denomination, agreeable to their exi&s;tence, they have been called Zoophytes,
a name implying vegetable nature indued with animal life; and indeed, in &s;ome
the marks of the animal are &s;o few, that it is difficult to give their place
in nature with preci&s;ion, or to tell whether it is a plant or an in&s;ect
that is the object of our con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Should it be a&s;ked what it is that con&s;titutes the
difference between animal and vegetable life, what it is that lays the line
that &s;eparates tho&s;e two great kingdoms from each other, it would be
difficult, perhaps we &s;hould find it impo&s;&s;ible, to return an an&s;wer.
The power of motion cannot form this di&s;tinction, &s;ince &s;ome vegetables
are po&s;&s;e&s;t of motion, and <PB N="162" REF="159"> many animals are
totally without it. The &s;en|&s;itive plant has obviou&s;ly a greater variety
of motions than the oy&s;ter or the pholas. The animal that fills the
acorn-&s;hell is immoveable, and can only clo&s;e its lid to defend it&s;elf
from external injury, while the flower, which goes by the name of the fly-trap,
&s;eems to clo&s;e upon the flies that light upon it, and that attempt to rifle
it of its honey. The animal in this in&s;tance, &s;eems to have &s;carce a
power of &s;elf defence; the ve|getable not only guards its
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, but &s;eizes upon the robber that would venture to invade
them. In like manner, the methods of propaga|tion give no &s;uperiority to the
lower rank of ani|mals. On the contrary, vegetables are frequently produced
more conformably to the higher ranks of the creation, and though &s;ome plants
are pro|duced by cuttings from others, yet the general manner of propagation is
from &s;eeds, laid in the womb of the earth, where they are hatched into the
&s;imilitude of the parent plant or flower. But a mo&s;t numerous tribe of
animals have lately been di&s;covered, which are propagated by cuttings, and
this in &s;o extraordinary a manner, that, though the original in&s;ect be
divided into a thou&s;and parts, each, however &s;mall, &s;hall be formed into
an animal, entirely re&s;embling that which was at fir&s;t divided; in this
re&s;pect, <PB N="163" REF="160"> therefore, certain races of animals &s;eem to
fall beneath vegetables, by their more imperfect propagation.</P>
<P>What, therefore, is the di&s;tinction between them, or are the
orders &s;o intimately blended as that it is impo&s;&s;ible to mark the
boundaries of each? To me it would &s;eem, that all animals are
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one power, of which vegetables are totally deficient; I
mean either the actual ability, or an aukward attempt at
&s;elf-pre&s;er|vation. However vegetables may &s;eem po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this
important quality, yet it is with them but a mechanical impul&s;e, re&s;embling
the rai&s;|ing one end of the lever, when you depre&s;s the other: the
&s;en&s;itive plant contracts and hangs its leaves, indeed, when touched, but
this mo|tion no way contributes to its &s;afety; the fly-trap flower acts
entirely in the &s;ame manner; and though it &s;eems to &s;eize the little
animal, that comes to annoy it, yet, in reality, only clo&s;es mechanically
upon it, and this inclo&s;ure neither contributes to its pre&s;ervation nor its
defence. But it is very different with in&s;ects, even of the lowe&s;t order;
the earth-worm not only contracts, but hides it&s;elf in the earth, and
e&s;capes with force &s;hare of &s;wiftne&s;s from its pur&s;uers. The polypus
hides its horns; the &s;tar-fi&s;h contracts its arms, upon the ap|pearance 
<PB N="164" REF="161"> even of di&s;tant dangers; they not only hunt for their
food, but provide for their &s;afety, and however imperfectly they may be
formed, yet &s;till they are in reality, placed many degrees above the
highe&s;t vegetable of the earth, and are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many animal
functions, as well as tho&s;e that are more elaborately formed.</P>
<P>But though the&s;e be &s;uperior to plants, they are very far
beneath their animated fellows of exi&s;tence. In the cla&s;s of zoophytes, we
may place all tho&s;e animals, which may be propa|gated by cuttings, or in
other words, which, if divided into two or more parts, each part in time,
becomes a &s;eparate and perfect animal; the head &s;hoots forth a tail, and on
the contrary, the tail produces a head; &s;ome of the&s;e will bear dividing,
but into two parts, &s;uch is the earth-worm; &s;ome may be divided into more
than two, and of this kind are many of the &s;tar fi&s;h; others &s;till may be
cut into a thou&s;and parts, each becoming a per|fect animal; they may be
turned in&s;ide out, like the finger of a glove, they may be mould|ed into all
manner of &s;hapes, yet &s;till their vivacious principle remains, &s;till
every &s;ingle part becomes perfect in its kind, and after a few days
exi&s;tence, exhibits all the arts and in|du&s;try <PB N="165" REF="162"> of
its contemptible parent! We &s;hall, therefore, divide zoophytes according to
their &s;everal degrees of perfection, namely, into worms, &s;tar-fi&s;h and
polypi; contenting our|&s;elves with a &s;hort review of tho&s;e nau&s;eous and
de&s;picable creatures, that excite our curio&s;ity chiefly by their
imperfections; it mu&s;t not be concealed, however, that much has of late been
written on this part of natural hi&s;tory. A new mode of animal production,
could not fail of exciting not only the curio&s;ity, but the a&s;to|ni&s;hment
of every philo&s;opher; many found their favourite &s;y&s;tems totally
overthrown by the di&s;|covery, and it was not without a wordy &s;truggle, that
they gave up what had formerly been their plea&s;ure and their pride. At
la&s;t, however, con|viction became too &s;trong for argument, and a
que&s;tion, which owed its general &s;pread rather to its novelty, than to its
importance, was given up in favour of the new di&s;covery.</P>

<PB N="166" REF="163">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of Worms.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t in the cla&s;s of zoophytes, are animals of the worm
kind, which being entirely de&s;titute of feet, trail them&s;elves along upon
the ground, and find them&s;elves a retreat under the earth, or in the water.
As the&s;e, like &s;er|pents, have a creeping motion, &s;o both, in general, go
under the common appellation of reptiles; a loath&s;ome, noxious, malignant
tribe, to which man by nature, as well as by religion, has the &s;tronge&s;t
antipathy. But though worms, as well as &s;erpents, are mo&s;tly without feet,
and have been doomed to creep along the earth on their bellies, yet their
motions are very different. The &s;erpent, as has been &s;aid before, having a
back bone, which it is incapable of contract|ing, bends its body into the form
of a bow, and then &s;hoots forward from the tail; but it is very different
with the worm, which has a power of contracting or lengthening it&s;elf at
will. There is a &s;piral mu&s;cle, that runs round its whole body, from the
head to tail, &s;omewhat re&s;embling a wire wound round a walking-cane, 
<PB N="167" REF="164"> which, when &s;lipped off, and one end extended and held
fa&s;t, will bring the other nearer to it; in this manner the earth-worm,
having &s;hot out, or extended its body, takes hold by the &s;lime of the fore
part of its body, and &s;o contracts and brings forward the hinder part; in
this manner it moves onward, not without great effort, but the occa&s;ions for
its progre&s;&s;ive motion are few.</P>
<P>As it is de&s;igned for living under the earth, and leading a
life of ob&s;curity, &s;o it &s;eems toler|ably adapted to its &s;ituation. Its
body is armed with &s;mall &s;tiff &s;harp burrs or prickles, which it can
erect or depre&s;s at plea&s;ure; under the &s;kin there lies a &s;limy juice,
to be ejected as oc|ca&s;ion requires, at certain perforations, between the
rings of the mu&s;ces, to lubricate its body, and facilitate its pa&s;&s;age
into the earth. Like mo&s;t other in&s;ects, it hath breathing-holes along the
back, adjoining each ring; but it is without bones, without eyes, without ears,
and, properly without feet. It has a mouth, and al&s;o an elemen|tary canal,
which runs along to the very point of the tail. In &s;ome worms, however,
particular|ly &s;uch as are found in the bodies of animals, this canal opens
towards the middle of the belly, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the tail. The
in|te&s;tines of the earth-worm, are always found <PB N="168" REF="165"> filled
with a very fine earth, which &s;eems to be the only nouri&s;hment the&s;e
animals are capable of receiving.</P>
<P>The animal is entirely without brain, but near the head is
placed the heart, which is &s;een to beat with a very di&s;tinct motion, and
round it are the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els, forming a number of little globules,
containing a milky fluid, which have an opening into the belly, not far from
the head: they are al&s;o often found to contain a number of eggs, which are
laid in the earth, and are hatched in twelve or four|teen days into life, by
the genial warmth of their &s;ituation; like &s;nails, all the&s;e animals
unite in them&s;elves, both &s;exes at once, the reptile that impregnates,
being impregnated in turn; few that walk out, but mu&s;t have ob|&s;erved them,
with their heads laid again&s;t each other, and &s;o &s;trongly attached, that
they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be trod upon.</P>
<P>When the eggs are laid in the earth, which, in about fourteen
days, as has been &s;aid, are hatched into maturity, the young ones come forth
very &s;mall, but perfectly formed, and &s;uffer no change during their
ex|i&s;tence: how long their life continues is not well known, but it certainly
holds for more than two or three &s;ea&s;ons. During the winter, 
<PB N="169" REF="166"> they bury them&s;elves deeper in the earth, and &s;eem,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to &s;hare the general torpidity of the in&s;ect tribe. In
&s;pring, they revive with the re&s;t of nature, and on tho&s;e oc|ca&s;ions, a
moi&s;t or dewy evening brings them forth from their retreats, for the
univer&s;al pur|po&s;e of continuing their kind. They chiefly live in a light
rich and fertile &s;oil, moi&s;tened by dews or accidental &s;howers, but avoid
tho&s;e places where the water is apt to lie on the &s;ur|face of the earth, or
where the clay is too &s;tiff for their ea&s;y progre&s;&s;ion under
ground.</P>
<P>Helple&s;s as they are formed, yet they &s;eem very vigilant in
avoiding tho&s;e animals that chiefly make them their prey; in particular, the
mole, who feeds entirely upon them be|neath the &s;urface, and who &s;eldom
ventures, from the dimne&s;s of its &s;ight, into the open air; him they avoid,
by darting up from the earth, the in&s;tant they feel the ground move; and
fi&s;hermen, who are well acquainted with this, take them in what numbers they
chu&s;e, by &s;tirring the earth where they expect to find them. They are
al&s;o driven from their retreats under ground, by pouring bitter or acrid
water thereon, &s;uch as that water in which green walnuts have been &s;teeped,
or a lye made of pot-a&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="167">Such is the general outline of the
hi&s;tory of the&s;e reptiles, which, as it &s;hould &s;eem, degrades them no
way beneath the rank of other animals of the in&s;ect creation; but we now come
to a part of their hi&s;tory, which proves the imperfection of their organs,
from the ea&s;ine&s;s with which the&s;e little machines may be damaged and
re|paired again. It is well known in mechanics, that the fine&s;t and mo&s;t
complicated in&s;truments are the mo&s;t ea&s;ily put out of order, and the
mo&s;t difficultly &s;et right; the &s;ame al&s;o obtains in the animal
machine. Man, the mo&s;t com|plicated machine of all others, who&s;e nerves are
more numerous, and powers of action more various, is mo&s;t ea&s;ily
de&s;troyed: he is &s;een to die under wounds which a quadruped or a bird could
ea&s;ily &s;urvive; and as we de&s;cend gradu|ally to the lower ranks, the
ruder the compo&s;i|tion, the more difficult it is to di&s;arange it. Some
animals live without their limbs, and of|ten are &s;een to reproduce them;
&s;ome are &s;een to live without their brain for many weeks to|gether;
caterpillars continue to increa&s;e and grow large, tho' all their nobler
organs are in|tirely de&s;troyed within; &s;ome animals continue to exi&s;t,
though cut in two, their nobler parts pre|&s;erving life, while the others
peri&s;h that were cut away; but the earth worm, and all the 
<PB N="171" REF="168"> zoophyte tribe, continue to live in &s;eparate parts,
and one animal, by the means of cut|ting, is divided into two di&s;tinct
exi&s;tences, &s;ometimes into a thou&s;and.</P>
<P>There is no phaenomenon in all natural hi&s;to|ry more
a&s;toni&s;hing than this, that man, at plea|&s;ure, &s;hould have a kind of
creative power, and out of one life make two, each compleatly formed, with all
its apparatus and functions, each with its perceptions, and powers of motion
and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, each as compleat in all re&s;pects as that from
which it derived its exi&s;t|ence, and equally enjoying the humble
grati|fications of its nature.</P>
<P>When De Cartes fir&s;t &s;tarted the opinion, that brutes were
machines, the di&s;covery of this &s;urpri&s;ing propagation was unknown, which
might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, have &s;trengthened his fanciful theory. What is
life, in brutes, he might have &s;aid, or where does it re&s;ide? In &s;ome we
find it &s;o diffu&s;ed, that every part &s;eems to maintain a vivacious
principle, and the &s;ame animal appears po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a thou&s;and
di&s;tinct irrational &s;ouls at the &s;ame time. But let us not, he would
&s;ay, give &s;o noble a name to &s;uch contemptible powers, but rank the
vivi|fying principle in the&s;e with the &s;ap that ri&s;es in vegetables, or
the moi&s;ture that contracts a <PB N="172" REF="169"> cord, or the heat that
puts water into motion! Nothing, in fact, de&s;erves the name of &s;oul, but
that which rea&s;ons, that which under&s;tands, and by knowing God, receives
the mark of its currency, and is minted with the impre&s;&s;ion of its great
Creator.</P>
<P>Sucb might have been the &s;peculations of this philo&s;opher,
however to leave theory, it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay that we owe the
fir&s;t di&s;covery of this power of reproduction in animals to Mr. Trembley,
who fir&s;t ob&s;erved it in the polypus, and after him, Spalanzani and others
found it taking place in the earth-worm, the &s;ea-worm, and &s;everal other
ill-formed animals of a like kind, which were &s;u&s;ceptible of this new mode
of propagation. This la&s;t philo&s;opher, has tried &s;everal experiments upon
the earth-worm, many of which &s;ucceeded according to his expectation; every
earth-worm, however, did not retain the vivacious principle with the &s;ame
ob&s;tinacy; &s;ome, when cut in two, were intirely de&s;troyed; others
&s;urvived only in the nobler part; and while the head was living the tail
entirely pe|ri&s;hed, and a new one was &s;een to burge on from the extremity.
But what was mo&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;ing of all, in &s;ome, particularly in the
&s;mall red-headed earth worm, both extremities &s;urvived the operation; the
head produced a <PB N="173" REF="170"> tail with the anus, the inte&s;tines,
the anular mu&s;cles, and the prickly beards; the tail part, on the other hand,
was &s;een to &s;hoot forth the nobler organs, and in le&s;s than the &s;pace
of three months &s;ent forth a head, heart, with all the apparatus and
in&s;truments of gene|ration. This part, as may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, was
produced much more &s;lowly than the for|mer, a new head taking above three or
four months for its completion, a new tail being &s;hot forth in le&s;s than as
many weeks. Thus two animals, by di&s;&s;ection, were made out of one, each
with their &s;eparate appetites, each endued with life and motion, and
&s;eemingly as perfect as that &s;ingle animal from whence they derived their
origin.</P>
<P>What was performed upon the earth-worm, was found to obtain
al&s;o in many other of the vermicular &s;pecies. The &s;ea-worm, the white
water-worm, and many of tho&s;e little worms with feelers, found at the bottom
of dirty ditches; in all the&s;e the nobler organs are of &s;uch little u&s;e,
that if taken away, the ani|mal does not &s;eem to feel the want of them; it
lives in all its parts, and in every part, and by a &s;trange paradox in
nature, the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s and contemptible life is of all others the
mo&s;t difficult to de&s;troy.</P>

<P>THE next order of zoophytes is that of the &s;tar fi&s;h, a
numerous tribe, &s;hapele&s;s and de|formed, a&s;&s;uming at different times
different appearances. The &s;ame animal that now appears round like a ball,
&s;hortly after flattens as thin as a plate. All of this kind are formed of a
&s;e|mi-tran&s;parent gelatinous &s;ub&s;tance, covered with a thin membrane,
and, to an inattentive &s;pectator, often appear like a lump of inani|mate
jelly, floating at random upon the &s;urface of the &s;ea, or thrown by chance

they will be found po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of life and motion; they will be found to
&s;hoot forth their arms in every direction, in order to &s;eize upon &s;uch

&s;aid, take &s;uch a variety of figures, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to
de&s;cribe them under one deter|minate &s;hape; but in general, their bodies
re|&s;emble a truncated cone, who&s;e ba&s;e is applied to the rock to which
they are found u&s;ually attached. Tho' generally tran&s;parent, yet they are
found of different colours, &s;ome inclining to <PB N="176" REF="174"> green,
&s;ome to red, &s;ome to white, and &s;ome to brown. In &s;ome, their colours
appear dif|fu&s;ed over the whole &s;urface, in &s;ome, they are often
&s;treaked, and in others often &s;potted. They are po&s;&s;e&s;t of a very
&s;low progre&s;&s;ive mo|tion, and in fine weather, they are continually
&s;een, &s;tretching out and fi&s;hing for their prey. Many of them are
po&s;&s;e&s;t of a number of long &s;lender filaments, in which they entangle
any &s;mall animals they happen to approach, and thus draw them into their
enormous &s;tomachs, which fill the whole cavity of their bodies. The harder
&s;hells continue for &s;ome weeks in|dige&s;ted, but at length, they undergo a
kind of maceration in the &s;tomach, and become a part of the &s;ub&s;tance of
the animal it&s;elf. The indige&s;tible parts, are returned by the &s;ame
aperture by which they were &s;wallowed, and then the &s;tar-fi&s;h begins to
fi&s;h for more. The&s;e al&s;o may be cut in pieces, and every part will
&s;urvive the operation; each becoming a perfect animal, endued with its
natural rapacity. Of this tribe, the num|ber is various, and the de&s;cription
of each would be tedious and unin&s;tructing; the man|ners and nature of all,
are nearly as de&s;cribed; but I will ju&s;t make mention of one creature,
which, tho' not properly belonging to this cla&s;s, <PB N="177" REF="175"> yet
is &s;o nearly related, that the pa&s;&s;ing it in &s;ilence would be an
unpardonable omi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Of all other animals, the cuttle-fi&s;h, tho' in &s;ome
re&s;pect &s;uperior to this tribe, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es qualities the mo&s;t
extraordinary. It is about two feet long, covered with a very thin &s;kin, and
its fle&s;h compo&s;ed of a gelatinous &s;ub&s;tance, which however within
&s;ide is &s;trengthened by a &s;trong bone, of which &s;uch great u&s;e is
made by the gold&s;miths. It is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of eight arms, which it
extends, and which are proba|bly of &s;ervice to it in fi&s;hing for its prey;
while in life, it is capable of lengthening or contract|ing the&s;e at
plea&s;ure; but when dead, they con|tract and lo&s;e their rigidity. They feed
upon &s;mall fi&s;h, which they &s;eize with their arms; and they are bred from
eggs, which are laid upon the weeds along the &s;ea-&s;hore.</P>
<P>The cuttle fi&s;h is found along many of the coa&s;ts of Europe,
but are not ea&s;ily caught, from a contrivance with which they are
furni&s;h|ed by nature; this is a black &s;ub&s;tance, of the colour of ink,
which is contained in a bladder generally on the left-&s;ide of the belly, and
which is ejected in the manner of an excrement from the anus. Whenever
therefore this fi&s;h is pur|&s;ued, and when it finds a difficulty of
e&s;caping, it &s;purts forth a great quantity of this black 
<PB N="178" REF="176"> liquor, by which the waters are totally darken|ed, and
then it e&s;capes, by lying clo&s;e at the bottom. In this manner the creature
finds its &s;afety, and men find ample cau&s;e for admira|tion, from the great
variety of &s;tratagems with which creatures are endued for their peculiar
pre&s;ervation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the Polypus.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE animals which we have de&s;cribed in the la&s;t chapter,
are variou&s;ly denominated. They have been called the Star-fi&s;h,
Sea-net|tles, and Sea-polypi. This la&s;t name has been peculiarly a&s;cribed
to them by the ancients, becau&s;e of the number of feelers or feet of which
they are all po&s;&s;e&s;t, and with which they have a &s;low progre&s;&s;ive
motion; but the mo|derns have given the name of Polypus, to a reptile that
lives in fre&s;h water, by no means &s;o large or ob&s;ervable. The&s;e are
found at the bottom of wet ditches, or attached to the un|der &s;urface of the
broad-leafed plants that grow and &s;wim on the waters. The &s;ame difference
holds between the&s;e and the &s;ea-water polypus, as between all the
productions of the &s;ea, and of the land and the ocean. The marine vegetables
and animals grow to a mon&s;trous &s;ize. The eel, the pike, or the bream of
fre&s;h-waters, is but &s;mall; but in the &s;ea, they grow to an enormous
magnitude. The herbs of the field are at mo&s;t but a few feet high; tho&s;e of
the &s;ea often &s;hoot forth a &s;talk of a hundred. It is &s;o between the
polypi of <PB N="180" REF="178"> both elements. Tho&s;e of the &s;ea are found
from two feet in length to three or four, and Pliny has even de&s;cribed one,
the arms of which were no le&s;s than thirty feet long. Tho&s;e in fre&s;h
waters, however, are comparatively minute; at their utmo&s;t &s;ize, &s;eldom
above three parts of an inch long, and when gathered up into their u&s;ual
form, not above a third even of tho&s;e dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P>It was upon the&s;e minute animals, that the power of
di&s;&s;ection was fir&s;t tried in multiply|ing their numbers. They had been
long con|&s;idered as little worthy the attention of ob&s;erv|ers, and were
con&s;igned to that neglect in which thou&s;ands of minute &s;pecies of
in&s;ects remain to this very day. It is true, indeed, that Reau|mur
ob&s;erved, cla&s;&s;ed, and named them. By contemplating their motions, he was
enabled di|&s;tinctly to pronounce on their being of the animal, and not of the
vegetable kingdom; and he call|ed them Polypi, from their great re&s;emblance
to tho&s;e larger ones that were found in the ocean. Still, however, their
properties were neglected, and their hi&s;tory unknown.</P>
<P>Mr. Trembley was the per&s;on to whom we owe the fir&s;t
di&s;covery of the amazing properties and powers of this little vivacious
creature: He divided this cla&s;s of animals into four different 
<PB N="181" REF="179"> kinds; into tho&s;e inclining to green, tho&s;e of a
browni&s;h ca&s;t, tho&s;e of fle&s;h-colour, tho&s;e which he calls the polype
d&eacute; panache. The differences of &s;tructure in the&s;e, as al&s;o of
co|lour, are ob&s;ervable enough; but the manner of their &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, of
&s;eizing their prey, and of their propagation, is pretty nearly the &s;ame in
all.</P>
<P>Whoever has looked with care into the bot|tom of a wet ditch,
when the water is &s;tagnant, and the &s;un has been powerful, may remember to
have &s;een many little tran&s;parent lumps of jelly, about the &s;ize of a
pea, and flatted on one &s;ide; &s;uch al&s;o as have examined the un|der
&s;ide of the broad-leafed weeds that grow on the &s;urface of the water,
mu&s;t have ob&s;erved them &s;tudded with a number of the&s;e little
jelly-like &s;ub&s;tances, which were probably then di&s;|regarded, becau&s;e
their nature and hi&s;tory was unknown. The&s;e little &s;ub&s;tances however,
were no other than living polypi gathered up into a quie&s;cent &s;tate and
&s;eemingly inanimate, becau&s;e either di&s;turbed, or not excited by the
calls of appetite to action. When they are &s;een exert|ing them&s;elves they
put on a very different appearance from that when at re&s;t; to conceive a
ju&s;t idea of their figure, we may &s;uppo&s;e the finger of a glove cut off
at the bottom; we may <PB N="182" REF="180"> &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o &s;everal
threads or horns plant|ed round the edge like a fringe. The hollow of this
finger will give us an idea of the &s;tomach of the animal, the threads
i&s;&s;uing forth from the edges may be con&s;idered as the arms or feelers,
with which it hunts for its prey. The animal, at its greate&s;t extent, is
&s;eldom &s;een above an inch and a half long, but it is much &s;horter when it
is contracted and at re&s;t; it is furni&s;hed neither with mu&s;cles nor
rings, and its manner of length|ening or contracting it&s;elf, more re&s;embles
that of the &s;nail, than worms, or any other in&s;ect. The polypus contracts
it&s;elf more or le&s;s, in proportion as it is touched, or as the water is
agitated in which they are &s;een. Warmth ani|mates them, and cold benumbs
them; but it requires a degree of cold approaching conge|lation before they are
reduced to perfect in|activity; tho&s;e of an inch have generally their arms
double, often thrice as long as their bo|dies. The arms, where the animal is
not di&s;turb|ed, and the &s;ea&s;on not unfavourable, are thrown about in
various directions, in order to &s;eize and entangle its little prey;
&s;ometimes three or four of the arms are thus employed, while the re&s;t are
contracted like the horns of a &s;nail, within the animal's body. It &s;eems
capable of giving what length it plea&s;es to the&s;e arms; it con|tracts 
<PB N="183" REF="181"> and extends them at plea&s;ure, and &s;tretches them
only in proportion to the remote|ne&s;s of the object it would &s;eize.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals have a progre&s;&s;ive motion, which is
performed by that power they have of lengthening and contracting them&s;elves
at plea|&s;ure; they go from one part of the bottom to another; they mount
along the margin of the water, and climb up the &s;ide of aquatic plants. They
often are &s;een to come to the &s;urface of the water, where they &s;u&s;pend
them&s;elves by their lower end. As they advance but very &s;lowly, they employ
a great deal of time in every action, and bind them&s;elves very &s;trongly to
whatever body they chance to move upon as they proceed; their adhe&s;ion is
voluntary, and is probably performed in the manner of a cupping gla&s;s
ap|plied to the body.</P>
<P>All animals of this kind have a remarkable attachment to turn
towards the light, and this naturally might induce an enquirer to look for
their eyes; but however carefully this &s;earch has been pur&s;ued, and however
excellent the micro&s;cope with which every part was examined yet nothing of
the appearance of this or|gan was found over the whole body; and it is mo&s;t
probable that, like &s;everal o|ther in&s;ects which hunt their prey by their 
<PB N="184" REF="182"> feeling, the&s;e creatures are unfurni&s;hed with
advantages which would be totally u&s;ele&s;s for their &s;upport.</P>
<P>In the center of the arms, as was &s;aid before, the mouth is
placed, which the animal can open and &s;hut at plea&s;ure, and this &s;erves
at once as a pa&s;&s;age for food, and an opening for it after dige&s;tion. The
inward part of the animal's body &s;eems to be one great &s;tomach, which is
open at both ends; but the purpo&s;es which the opening at the bottom &s;erves
are hitherto un|known, but certainly not for excluding their excrements, for
tho&s;e are ejected at the aperture by which they are taken in. If the
&s;urface of the body of this little creature be examined with a micro&s;cope,
it will be found &s;tudded with a number of warts, as al&s;o the arms,
e&s;pecially when they are contracted; and the&s;e tubercles, as we &s;hall
pre&s;ently &s;ee, an&s;wer a very important pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>If we examine their way of living, we &s;hall find the&s;e
in&s;ects chiefly &s;ub&s;i&s;ting upon others, much le&s;s than them&s;elves,
particularly a kind of millepedes that live in the water, and a very &s;mall
red worm, which they &s;eize with great avidity. In &s;hort, no in&s;ect
what&s;oever, le&s;s than them&s;elves, &s;eems to come ami&s;s to them; their
arms, as was ob&s;erved above, &s;erve them as a <PB N="185" REF="183"> net
would a fi&s;herman, or perhaps more ex|actly &s;peaking, as a lime-twig does a
fowler. Wherever their prey is perceived, which the ani|mal effects by its
feeling, it is &s;ufficient to touch the object it would &s;eize upon and it is
fa&s;tened, without a power of e&s;caping. The in&s;tant one of this in&s;ect's
long arms is laid upon a millepede, the little in&s;ect &s;ticks without a
po&s;&s;ibility of re|treating. The greater the di&s;tance at which it is
touched, the greater is the ea&s;e with which the Polypus brings the prey to
its mouth. If the lit|tle object be near, tho' irretrievably caught, it is not
without great difficulty that it can be brought to the mouth and &s;wallowed.
When the Polypus is un&s;upplied with prey, it te&s;tifies its hunger by
opening its mouth; the aperture, however, is &s;o &s;mall that it cannot be
ea&s;ily perceived; but when, with any of its long arms, it has &s;eized upon
its prey, it then opens the mouth di&s;tinct|ly enough, and this opening is
always in pro|portion to the &s;ize of the animal which it would &s;wallow; the
lips dilate in&s;en&s;ibly by &s;mall degrees, and adju&s;t them&s;elves
preci&s;ely to the figure of their prey. Mr. Trembley, who took a plea&s;ure in
feeding this u&s;ele&s;s brood, found that they could devour aliments of every
kind, fi&s;h and fle&s;h as well as in&s;ects; but he owns they did not thrive
&s;o well upon beef and <PB N="186" REF="184"> veal, as upon the little worms
of their own provi|ding. When he gave one of the&s;e fami&s;hed rep|tiles any
&s;ub&s;tance which was improper to &s;erve for aliment, at fir&s;t it &s;eized
the prey with avi|dity, but after keeping it &s;ome time entangled near the
mouth, it let drop again with di|&s;tingui&s;hing nicety.</P>
<P>When &s;everal polypi happen to fall upon the &s;ame worm, they
di&s;pute their common prey with each other. Two of them are often &s;een
&s;eizing the &s;ame worm at different ends, and dragging it at oppo&s;ie
directions with great force. It often happens that while one is &s;wal|lowing
its re&s;pective end, the other is al&s;o em|ployed in the &s;ame manner, and
thus they con|tinue &s;wallowing each his part, until their mouths meet
together; they then re&s;t, each for &s;ome time in this &s;ituation, till the
worm breaks be|tween them, and each goes off with his &s;hare; but it often
happens, that a &s;eemingly more dangerous combat en&s;ues, when the mouths of
both are thus joined upon one common prey to|gether: the large&s;t polypus then
gapes and &s;wal|lows his antagoni&s;t; but what is very wonderful, the animal
thus &s;wallowed &s;eems to be rather a gainer by the misfortune. After it has
lain in the conquerors body for about an hour, it i&s;|&s;ues unhurt, and often
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the prey <PB N="187" REF="185"> which had been the
original cau&s;e of conten|tion; how happy would it be for men, if they had as
little to fear from each other!</P>
<P>The&s;e reptiles continue eating the whole year, except when the
cold approaches to congelation; and then, like mo&s;t others of the in&s;ect
tribe, they feel the general torpor of nature, and all their faculties are for
two or three months &s;u&s;pended; but if they ab&s;tain at one time, they are
equally voracious at ano|ther, and like &s;nakes, ants, and other animals that
are torpid in winter, the meal of one day &s;ufficies them for &s;everal months
together. In general, however, they devour more largely in proportion to their
&s;ize, and their growth is quick exactly as they are fed; &s;uch as are be&s;t
&s;upplied, &s;oone&s;t acquire their large&s;t &s;ize, but they dimini&s;h
al&s;o in their growth with the &s;ame facility, if their food be taken
away.</P>
<P>Such are the more obvious properties of the&s;e little animals,
but the mo&s;t wonderful &s;till remain behind: Their manner of propa|gation,
or rather multiplication, has for &s;ome years been the a&s;toni&s;hment of all
the learned of Europe. They are produced in as great a variety of manners as
every &s;pecies of vegetable. Some polypi are propagated from eggs, as plants
are from their &s;eed; <PB N="188" REF="186"> &s;ome are produced by buds
i&s;&s;uing from their bodies, as plants are produced by inoculation, while all
may be multiplied by cuttings, and this to a degree of minutene&s;s that
exceeds even philo&s;ophical per&s;everance.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to &s;uch of this kind as are hatched from the
egg little curious can be added, as it is a method of propagation &s;o com|mon
to all the tribes of in&s;ect nature; but with regard to &s;uch as are produced
like buds from their parent &s;tem, or like cuttings from an ori|ginal root,
their hi&s;tory requires a more de|tailed explanation. If a polypus be
carefully ob&s;erved in &s;ummer, when the&s;e animals are chiefly active, and
more particularly prepared for propagation, it will be found to burgeon forth
from different parts of its body &s;everal tubercles or little knobs, which
grow larger and larger every day; after two or three days in&s;pection, what at
fir&s;t appeared but a &s;mall excre&s;cence takes the figure of a &s;mall
animal, entirely re&s;embling its parent, furni&s;hed with feelers, a mouth,
and all the apparatus for &s;eizing and dige&s;ting its prey. This little
crea|ture every day becomes larger, like the parent, to which it continues
attached; it &s;preads its arms to &s;eize upon whatever in&s;ect is proper for
aliment, and devours it for its own <PB N="189" REF="187"> particular benefit;
thus it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of two &s;ources of nouri&s;hment, that which it
receives from the parent by the tail, and that which it receives from its own
indu&s;try by the mouth. The food which the&s;e animals receive often tinctures
the whole body, and upon this occa|&s;ion the parent is often &s;een
communicating a part of its own fluids to that of its progeny that grows upon
it; while, on the contrary, it never receives any tincture, from any
&s;ub|&s;tance that is caught and &s;wallowed by its young. If the parent
&s;wallows a red worm, which gives a tincture to all its fluids, the young one
par|takes of the parental colour; but if the latter &s;hould &s;eize upon the
&s;ame prey, the parent polypus is no way benefited by the capture, but all the
advantage remains with the young one.</P>
<P>But we are not to &s;uppo&s;e that the parent is capable of
producing only one at a time, &s;e|veral young ones are thus &s;een at once, of
dif|ferent &s;izes, growing from its body, &s;ome ju&s;t budding forth, others
acquiring their perfect form, and others come to &s;ufficient maturity, and
ju&s;t ready to drop from the original &s;tem to which they had been attached
for &s;everal days. But what is more extraordinary &s;till, tho&s;e young ones
them&s;elves that continue at|tached <PB N="190" REF="188"> to their parent,
are &s;een to burgeon, and propagate their own young ones al&s;o, each holding
the &s;ame dependance upon its re&s;pec|tive parent, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
the &s;ame advan|tages that have been already de&s;cribed in the fir&s;t
connection. Thus we &s;ee a &s;urprizing chain of exi&s;tence continued, and
numbers of animals naturally produced without any union of the &s;exes, or
other previous di&s;po&s;ition of nature.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be the mo&s;t natural way by which the&s;e
in&s;ects are multiplied; their pro|duction from the egg being not &s;o common;
and tho' &s;ome of this kind are found with a little bladder attached to their
bodies, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be filled with eggs, which afterwards come to
maturity, yet the artificial method of propagating the&s;e animals, is much
more expeditious and equally certain: It is in|different whether one of them be
cut into ten, or ten hundred parts, each becomes as perfect an animal as that
which was originally divided, but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the &s;maller
the part which is thus &s;eparated from the re&s;t, the longer it will be in
coming to maturity, or in a&s;&s;uming its perfect form. It would be end|le&s;s
to recount the many experiments that have been tried upon this philo&s;ophical
prodigy; <PB N="191" REF="189"> the animal has been twi&s;ted, and turned into
all manner of &s;hapes; it has been turned in&s;ide out, it has been cut in
every divi&s;ion, yet &s;till it continued to move; its parts adapted
them|&s;elves again to each other, and in a &s;hort time it became as voracious
and indu&s;trious as be|fore.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e kinds mentioned by Mr.Tremb|ley, there are
various others which have been lately di&s;covered by the vigilance of
&s;ucceeding ob&s;ervers, and &s;ome of the&s;e &s;o &s;trongly re|&s;emble a
flowering vegetable in their forms, that they have been mi&s;taken by many
natu|rali&s;ts for &s;uch. Mr. Hughes, the author of the Natural Hi&s;tory of
Barbadoes, has de&s;cribed a &s;pecies of this animal, but has mi&s;taken its
nature, and called it a &s;en&s;itive flowering plant; he ob&s;erved it to take
refuge in the holes of rocks, and when undi&s;turbed, to &s;pread forth a
number of ramifications, each terminated by a flowery petal which &s;hrunk at
the approach of the hand, and withdrew into the hole from whence before it had
been &s;een to i&s;&s;ue. This plant however was no other than an animal of the
polypus kind, which is not only to be found in Barbadoes, but al&s;o on many
parts of the coa&s;t of Cornwall, and along the &s;hores of the Continent.</P>

<P>IT is very probable that the animals we &s;ee, and are

at &s;ea, they are &s;till more abundant; for the greate&s;t part of what would

This opinion, however, &s;ome time after, began to be &s;haken by Rumphius and
Ju&s;&s;ieu, and at la&s;t by the ingeni|ous Mr. Ellis who by a more
&s;agacious and dili|gent enquiry into nature, put it pa&s;t doubt, that corals
and &s;ponges were entirely the work of animals and that like the honey-comb,
which was formed by the bee, the coral was the work of an infinite number of
reptiles of the polypus kind, who&s;e united labours were thus capable of
filling whole tracts of the ocean with tho&s;e embarra&s;&s;ing tokens of their
indu&s;try.</P>
<P>If in our re&s;earches after the nature of the&s;e plants, we
&s;hould be induced to break off a branch of the coraline &s;ub&s;tance, and
ob&s;erve it carefully, we &s;hall perceive its whole &s;urface, which is very
rugged and irregular, covered with a mucous fluid, and almo&s;t in every part
&s;tudded with little jelly-like drops, which when clo&s;ely examined, will be
found to be no other than reptiles of the polypus kind. The&s;e have their
motions, their arms, their appetites, exactly re&s;embling tho&s;e de&s;cribed
in the la&s;t chapter, but they &s;oon expire when taken out of the &s;ea, and
our curio&s;ity is at once &s;topped in its <PB N="195" REF="194"> career, by
the animals cea&s;ing to give any marks of their indu&s;try; recour&s;e
therefore has been had to other expedients, in order to de|termine the nature
of the inhabitant, as well as the habitation.</P>
<P>If a coraline plant be &s;trictly ob&s;erved, while &s;till
growing in the &s;ea, and the animals upon its &s;urface be not di&s;turbed,
either by the agi|tation of the waters, or the touch of the ob|&s;erver, the
little polypi will then be &s;een in infinite numbers, each i&s;&s;uing from
its cell, and in &s;ome kinds, the head covered with a little &s;hell,
re&s;embling an umbrella, the arms &s;pread abroad, in order to &s;eize its
prey, while the hinder part &s;till remains attached to its habita|tion, from
whence it never wholly removes. By this time it is perceived that the number of
inha|bitants is infinitely greater than was at fir&s;t &s;u&s;|pected; that
they are all a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed in the &s;ame pur&s;uits, and that they
i&s;&s;ue from their re&s;pective cells, and retire into them at plea|&s;ure.
Still, however, there are no proofs that tho&s;e large branches which they
inhabit are en|tirely the con&s;truction of &s;uch feeble and minute animals.
But chemi&s;try will be found to lend a clue to extricate us from our doubts in
this par|ticular. Like the &s;hells which are formed by <PB N="196" REF="195">
&s;nails, mu&s;cles and oy&s;ters, the&s;e cora|line &s;ub&s;tances
efferve&s;ce with acids, and may therefore well be &s;uppo&s;ed to partake of
the &s;ame animal nature. But Mr. Ellis went &s;till farther, and examined
their operations, ju&s;t as they were beginning. Ob&s;erving an oy&s;ter-bed
which had been for &s;ome time neglected, he there perceived the fir&s;t
rudiments of a coraline plantation, and tufts of various kinds &s;hooting from
different parts of this favourable &s;oil. It was upon the&s;e he tried his
principal experiment. He took out the oy&s;ters which were thus furni&s;hed
with cora|lines, and placed them in a large wooden ve&s;&s;el, covering them
with &s;ea-water. In about an hour, he perceived the animals, which before had
been contracted by handling, and had &s;hewn no &s;igns of life, expanding
them&s;elves in every direction, and appearing employed in their own natural
manner. Perceiving them therefore in this &s;tate, his next aim was to
pre&s;erve them thus expanded, &s;o as to be permanent objects of curio&s;ity.
For this purpo&s;e he poured, by &s;low degrees, an equal quantity of
boiling-water into the ve&s;&s;el of &s;ea water in which they were immer&s;ed.
He then &s;eparated each polypus with pincers from its &s;hell, and plunged
each &s;e|parately into &s;mall chry&s;tal va&s;es, filled with &s;pirit 
<PB N="197" REF="196"> of wine mixed with water. By this means, the animal was
pre&s;erved entire, without having time to contract it&s;elf, and he thus
perceived a variety of kinds, almo&s;t equal to that variety of productions
which the&s;e little animals are &s;een to form. He has been thus able to
perceive and de&s;cribe fifty different kinds, each of which is &s;een to
po&s;&s;e&s;s its own peculiar mode of con|&s;truction, and to form a coraline
that none of the re&s;t can imitate. It is true indeed, than on every coraline
&s;ub&s;tance there are a number of polypi found, no way re&s;embling tho&s;e
which are the erectors of the building; the&s;e may be called a vagabond race
of reptiles, that are only intruders upon the labours of others, and that take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of habitations, which they have neither art nor power to
build for them&s;elves. But in general, the &s;ame difference that
&s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the honeycomb of the bee, and the paper-like cells of
the wa&s;p, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the different habitations of the
coral-making polypi.</P>
<P>With regard to the various forms of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, they
have obtained different names from the nature of the animal that produced them,
or the likene&s;s they bear to &s;ome well|known object, &s;uch as coralines
fungimadre-pores, &s;ponges, a&s;troites, and keratophytes. Tho' 
<PB N="198" REF="197"> the&s;e differ extremely in their outward appear|ances,
yet they all are formed in the &s;ame manner by reptiles of various kinds and
nature. When examined chemically, they all di&s;cover the marks of animal
formation; the corals, as was &s;aid, di&s;&s;olve in acids, the &s;ponges burn
with an odour &s;trongly re&s;embling that of burnt horn. We are left
&s;omewhat at a lo&s;s with re|gard to the preci&s;e manner in which this
multi|tude of cells which at la&s;t a&s;&s;ume the appearance of a plant or
flower, are formed. If we may be led in this &s;ubject by analogy, it is mo&s;t
probable, that the &s;ub&s;tance of coral is produced in the &s;ame manner that
the &s;hell of the &s;nail grows round it; the&s;e little reptiles are each
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;limy matter, which covers its body, and this
hardening, as in the &s;nail, be|comes an habitation exactly fitted to the body
of the animal that is to re&s;ide in it; &s;everal of the&s;e habitations being
joined together, form at length a con&s;iderable ma&s;s, and as mo&s;t ani|mals
are productive, in proportion to their mi|nutene&s;s, &s;o the&s;e multiplying
in a &s;urpri&s;ing degree at length form tho&s;e exten&s;ive fore&s;ts that
cover the bottom of the deep.</P>
<P>Thus all nature &s;eems replete with life; almo&s;t every plant
on land has its &s;urface co|vered with millions of the&s;e minute creatures, 
<PB N="199" REF="198"> of who&s;e exi&s;tence we are certain, but of who&s;e
u&s;es we are intirely ignorant; while numbers of what &s;eem plants at &s;ea
are not only the receptacles of in&s;ects, but al&s;o en|tirely of in&s;ect
formation. This might have led &s;ome late philo&s;ophers into an opinion, that
all nature was animated, that every, even the mo&s;t inert ma&s;s of matter,
was en|dued with life and &s;en&s;ation, but wanted or|gans to make tho&s;e
&s;en&s;ations perceptible to the ob&s;erver: Tho&s;e opinions, taken up at
random, are difficultly maintained, and as difficultly refuted; like combatants
that meet in the dark, each party may deal a thou&s;and blows without ever
reaching the adver&s;ary. Tho&s;e perhaps are wi&s;er who view nature as &s;he
offers; who without &s;earching too deeply into the rece&s;&s;es in which &s;he
ultimately hides, are contented to take her as &s;he pre|&s;ents her&s;elf, and
&s;toring their minds with effects, rather than with cau&s;es, in&s;tead of the
embarra&s;ment of &s;y&s;tems, about which few agree, are contented with the
hi&s;tory of appearances, concerning which, all mankind have but one
opinion.</P>
