<HEAD>CHAPTER I. In which the Author confutes him&s;elf.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING been &s;o long employed in finding words, according to rule and method, for others, I begin to think I have a right to be&s;tow &s;ome according to my own fancy, and that ju&s;t now prompts me to write without any rule or method what&s;oever.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place then, permit me to &s;ay, that I do not allow any man can have a fair excu&s;e for not reading the&s;e volumes once at lea&s;t in his life, provided he can read at all. For what is the plea, I would fain know, that he can &s;et up for refu&s;ing them a peru&s;al? Is he too wi&s;e to be taught any thing new?&mdash;they do not pretend to have any new thing in them or about them; they boa&s;t them&s;elves to be as old as nature; and as for in&s;truction,
<PB N="2" REF="6">
if he is too wi&s;e to want it, they are not &s;o fooli&s;h as to force it upon him again&s;t his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Is he too lazy to be amu&s;ed by any reading? then let him employ a toad-eater to recite them in his ears till he falls a&s;leep; he cannot purcha&s;e a cheaper or more harmle&s;s narcotic in his apothecary's &s;hop.</P>
<P>Is he too proud to &s;toop his genius to the peru&s;al of a trivial novel? my life upon it, his genius is oftentimes more trivially employed. Is truth his con&s;tant &s;tudy and pur&s;uit? and has he not yet found out that there is truth in fiction; that by the device of fable (as the philo&s;opher Saint Pierre well ob&s;erves) the &s;oul gradually opens it&s;elf to truth? I am vain enough to think there may be many more truths in this poor fable, than he will di&s;cover or comprehend in all his meta|phy&s;ics.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may plead bu&s;ine&s;s, and bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be followed.&mdash;True! and &s;o mu&s;t hounds; but the man who follows either, be it ever &s;o clo&s;ely, will &s;till find that he has gone many miles out of his way. Let the man of bu&s;i|ne&s;s recollect how much of his life is &s;pent in being bu&s;y about nothing, and he cannot but
<PB N="3" REF="7">
acknowledge he has had time to be&s;tow upon the reading of the&s;e little books, and a hun|dred others. But all this while he has been accumulating money; if he dies to-morrow, he will die worth one hundred thou&s;and pounds; and if he does, <HI>is he any whit wi&s;er,</HI> (I put the que&s;tion in the words of the inimitable author of <HI>The Serious Call</HI>) <HI>is he any whit wi&s;er,</HI> I de|mand, <HI>than he who has taken the &s;ame pains to have a hundred thou&s;and pair of boots and &s;purs when he leaves the world?</HI></P>
<P>But harkye, Mr. Noveli&s;t, the fa&s;tidious phi|lo&s;opher will &s;ay, my &s;tudies do not lie your way. To him I could an&s;wer&mdash;then are my &s;tudies, learned Sir, more complai&s;ant than your's; for as far as you your&s;elf participate of human nature, &s;o far you come within the &s;cope of my re&s;earches; why then may not you deign to read me, though I do not a&s;pire to copy you? Though your proud ca&s;tle is barred again&s;t my approach, my humble cot|tage is the &s;eat of general ho&s;pitality, and open to you in common with the re&s;t of my fellow creatures. The &s;imple goo&s;e-quill, that can fan one &s;park of pure benevolence into activity by the playfulne&s;s of its motion, has done more for mankind than the full-plumed philo&s;opher,
<PB N="4" REF="8">
who, with the &s;trut of the goo&s;e it&s;elf, cackles out his de&s;picable &s;pleen, and hi&s;&s;es at each pa&s;&s;enger as he goes regardle&s;s by him.</P>
<P>If but one of all my readers has felt the &s;ympathy of a generous &s;entiment, if another has experienced the con&s;cious &s;en&s;e of &s;elf-reproaching turpitude, and blu&s;hed at the di&s;|covery, I think I have thrown more light into the world, than the philo&s;opher can dig out of the bowels of the earth, though he may there|by affect to decide upon the world's age, as jockies do upon hor&s;es by looking in their mouths. What if philo&s;ophers have now found out that water is no element? they have neither added to its u&s;es, nor taken any away; and as for me, though, for peace &s;ake, I will for|bear to &s;ay it is an element, I will not promi&s;e them to re&s;t my faith &s;o far upon their dogma, as to &s;ay, that it is not. The Author of Nature &s;eems graciou&s;ly to have ordained, that in &s;earching after things without u&s;e, our enqui|ries &s;hould be pur&s;ued without &s;ucce&s;s, &s;o that no labour might be wa&s;ted upon things that cannot profit us: but it is only after the&s;e curious nothings that our philo&s;opher is ever on the que&s;t; and yet he pretends to &s;ay, that he has no lei&s;ure to be&s;tow upon my men and
<PB N="5" REF="9">
women. Why will he not rather &s;tudy to be informed of what would profit him to know, and &s;ubmit to be ignorant of what the Great Di&s;po&s;er of the Univer&s;e hath, in tender con&s;i|deration of his &s;hort-lived creatures, buried out of &s;ight? As much truth as man's intellects can admit, is acce&s;&s;ible to man's enquiries, but ignorance is given to the &s;oul, as the lid is be|&s;towed upon the eye; it lets in all the light it can u&s;efully di&s;pen&s;e with, and &s;huts out what it cannot bear. And now, no more of the philo&s;opher; whil&s;t I am contemplating the &s;tatue, let him hunt after the beetle that crawls at the ba&s;e of it.</P>
<P>There is, notwith&s;tanding, more for me to do; and as the&s;e volumes are my clients, &s;o am I their advocate, and mu&s;t be prepared for all that may oppo&s;e me: the next, however, is a gentle caviller, and approaches in a form that challenges my re&s;pect; it is a reader I would not offend and &s;hock for all that fame could give me; &s;he comes with mode&s;t blu&s;hes on her cheeks, and points to certain pages doubled down in my offending work, too highly colour|ed for her cha&s;te revolting eye to re&s;t upon. What &s;hall I reply to this appellant? How de|fend my&s;elf from one, who comes into the li&s;ts
<PB N="6" REF="10">
with all the virtues armed in her &s;upport? Where now is my impure Jemima? where is Fanny Claypole? where even my benevolent Su&s;an May?&mdash;Fled out of &s;ight, aba&s;hed and &s;elf condemned! What avails it me to &s;ay that they are Nature's children? My reproving critic does not wi&s;h to make acquaintance with the profligates of her family. In vain I urge, that contra&s;t is the &s;oul of compo&s;ition; that joy and &s;orrow, health and &s;ickne&s;s, good and evil, chequer life it&s;elf through every &s;tage; that even virtue wants an oppo&s;ite to give its lu&s;tre full di&s;play: &s;he does not think that &s;cenes, which addre&s;s them&s;elves to the pa&s;&s;ions, can be defended by arguments that apply to the judgment: I may be ju&s;tified by the rules of compo&s;ition; &s;he is trying me by tho&s;e of de|corum. If I &s;helter my&s;elf in the plea, that temptations are the te&s;t of an heroic &s;pirit; that I cannot <HI>make bricks without &s;traw</HI>; and that although the &s;aid &s;traw be of an inflam|mable quality, yet I mu&s;t work with &s;uch ma|terials as I have: &s;he will not he&s;itate to admit the nece&s;&s;ity of temptations, but &s;he will re|&s;olutely condemn the too profu&s;e and promi|nent di&s;play of them; &s;he would work her &s;hades more tender; mine are too bold: if I
<PB N="7" REF="11">
&s;ay, wait for the moral, &s;he replies, that it is the nature of &s;u&s;ceptibility not to wait; the mi&s;chief is in the front, the moral is in the rear; the remedy cannot always overtake the di&s;ea&s;e; and &s;he a&s;ks, where is the wit in vo|luntarily provoking the fang of the viper, be|cau&s;e, for&s;ooth, we have a medicine in our clo&s;et that will &s;taunch the poi&s;on, if we do not &s;lip the time of applying it?</P>
<P>Mark now, candid reader, if I have not wove a hedge about my&s;elf, which I have nei|ther cunning to creep through, nor agility to climb; but it is ever thus when I argue with the ladies. If their mode&s;ty is of &s;o touchy a temper, as to accu&s;e me of impudence, I know no better way to convince them of their mi&s;|take, than by copying that mode&s;ty, and making no defence; and &s;ure I am, that &s;uch would be their conduct in the ca&s;e of real at|tack, when the relation of it only &s;tirs them into &s;uch tremors and palpitations: I fear, therefore, that their extreme &s;u&s;ceptibility proves too much; tho&s;e mu&s;t ride their pal|freys with a very loo&s;e rein, who are &s;o &s;oon thrown out of their &s;eat upon every little &s;tart or &s;tumble that they make.</P>
<P>What I have written, I have written in the
<PB N="8" REF="12">
hope of recommending virtue by the fiction of a virtuous character, which, to render ami|able, I made natural, and to render natural, I made &s;ubject to temptations, though re&s;olute in with&s;tanding them: in one in&s;tance only my hero owes his victory to chance, and not to his own fortitude: if virtue therefore can|not read her own encomium, without catching fire at the allurements of her antagoni&s;t, &s;he is not that pure and perfect virtue I was &s;tu|dious to pay court to, but &s;ome hypocrite, who has ba&s;ely tricked her&s;elf out in the uniform of the corps, for the opportunity of de&s;erting over to the enemy with her arms and accou|trements.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. A Peep behind the Curtain at Crowbery Ca&s;tle.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST the gentle bo&s;om of I&s;abella was rent with a thou&s;and perplexing in|quietudes, the proud exulting heart of Fanny Claypole was anticipating the fancied joys of rank and &s;plendour, and already practi&s;ing the
<PB N="9" REF="13">
&s;tately airs of a Vi&s;counte&s;s elect. Her uncle now began to pa&s;s his time not quite &s;o much to his &s;atisfaction as he had done: though his niece &s;till continued to treat him with external civility, yet there was a gracious manner in it, that conveyed the idea of conde&s;cen&s;ion and protection, rather than of cordiality or re&s;pect. The re&s;traint which &s;he and her noble para|mour &s;ubmitted to in his company, though as little as decency could di&s;pen&s;e with, was &s;till &s;omething more than they could willingly &s;pare on certain occa&s;ions, and he then began to di&s;cover, that all his accommodating com|placency did not quite an&s;wer their purpo&s;es, and that his ab&s;ence began to be wi&s;hed for by both parties. This indeed was more than in|&s;inuated to him by dumb &s;hew; for my Lord took frequent occa&s;ions of enquiring, whether Sir Roger Man&s;tock would not be unea&s;y at his pari&s;h being left without a re&s;ident mi|ni&s;ter, and once or twice a&s;ked him, in a natu|ral manner, if he was doing any thing at the par&s;onage, and whether it would require any repairs before it was made fit for his recep|tion, intimating, with much &s;eeming kindne&s;s, that if there was any thing wanting for his comfort, he would &s;end his own workmen over,
<PB N="10" REF="14">
and fit it to his wi&s;hes; adding, that it would ever give him the mo&s;t &s;upreme delight to &s;hew any mark of his re&s;pect to the uncle of his amiable friend Mi&s;s Claypole. The&s;e hints that &s;agacious gentleman was not &s;low to comprehend; but it did not ju&s;t now &s;uit him to put them into practice.</P>
<P>When lawyer Ferret returned from Man|&s;tock, and the copy of Lady Crowbery's will, which he had there taken, had been peru&s;ed by his Lord&s;hip, that noble per&s;onage, in a man|ner &s;uitable to his high dignity, expre&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t &s;overeign contempt for the good things of this world, which it had conveyed in &s;uch ample proportion to the fair I&s;abella, and &s;o &s;paringly to him&s;elf; in fact, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that as his Lord&s;hip's expectations were extremely moderate, his di&s;appointment could not be very great, &s;o that he bore the event without any great exerci&s;e of his vir|tues; one thing, however, he remarked with a con&s;iderable degree of &s;atisfaction, and this was, the unexpected omi&s;&s;ion of any legacy to our hero Henry: this circum&s;tance he com|municated, without lo&s;s of time, to Mr. Clay|pole and Mi&s;s Fanny, commenting upon it in a &s;tile that &s;ufficiently di&s;clo&s;ed to them the
<PB N="11" REF="15">
gratification he &s;ecretly derived to him&s;elf in talking of it.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You &s;ee,"</Q> cried his Lord&s;hip, in his u&s;ual &s;tile of plea&s;antry, <Q REND="inline">"what &s;ort of &s;tuff her lady&s;hip's liking to that young fellow was made of! no longer pipe, no longer pay, was her maxim. He mu&s;t now &s;ink into his primitive ob&s;curity; all his golden hopes are bla&s;ted, and, I dare engage, he is at this mo|ment venting execrations again&s;t her deceit and his own credulity. But he is rightly &s;erv'd; may &s;uch ever be the fate of all up|&s;tart favourites of married ladies!"</Q>&mdash;Here Claypole chimed in, with an inference or two in the way of retort upon Henry for his refu|&s;al of Blachford's beque&s;t, ob&s;erving, that the man, who, from an affectation of di&s;intere&s;ted|ne&s;s, with&s;tood the favours of fortune when they were tendered to him, generally lived long enough to find him&s;elf the dupe of his own vanity, and to bewail his folly in the bit|terne&s;s of &s;elf-reproach and vexation. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee but one chance that remains for this &s;illy fel|low,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"which is, to betake him&s;elf with all humility to Blachford's leavings, and pay his court, without lo&s;s of time, to Mrs. Su&s;an May of meretricious memory, by who&s;e favour he may &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon the bread of
<PB N="12" REF="16">
infamy, and &s;ing p&s;alms with Ezekiel Daw to &s;ome godly tune, whil&s;t the old dame &s;cums the pot. So ends the hi&s;tory of Henry the Foundling, who&s;e adventures, with the help of a little modern garni&s;h, may furni&s;h matter to &s;ome paltry noveli&s;t for a &s;curvy tale, to fill a gap in the &s;helves of a circulating library; and, if the writer has the wit to make the mo&s;t of it, he may find out a moral in the cata&s;trophe of his hero, and entitle it, The Ri&s;e and Fall of Vanity; for &s;uch in fact it is."</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Fanny threw a different light upon the &s;ubject; &s;he confe&s;&s;ed he well de&s;erved the di&s;|appointment he had met with; but &s;he did not think that was excu&s;e &s;ufficient for the per&s;on who di&s;appointed him. <Q REND="inline">"I own,"</Q> &s;aid that candid young lady, <Q REND="inline">"I have always accu&s;tom'd my&s;elf to con&s;ider a promi&s;e as a &s;acred thing: where I give hopes I think my&s;elf in con|&s;cience bound to make them good; and on the other hand, where they are given to me, I &s;hould hold the per&s;on ba&s;e in the extreme, abandon'd to all &s;en&s;e of honour, and a wretch, whom, without a crime, we might treat as an outlaw and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who violated the faith he had pledg'd, and the word of promi&s;e he had given. Now I do not mean to impute this
<PB N="13" REF="17">
ba&s;ene&s;s to any per&s;on in particular, much le&s;s to the re&s;pectable object of our pre&s;ent con|ver&s;ation; I only beg leave to ob&s;erve, that in all connections between man and woman, where favours have been interchang'd, and promi&s;es grafted upon tho&s;e pledges of affec|tion, they are binding in the mo&s;t &s;acred &s;en&s;e, and he or &s;he, who breaks from them, abandon'd in the extreme&s;t degree."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly,"</Q> interpo&s;ed my Lord, <Q REND="inline">"with|out all doubt you &s;peak what every per&s;on of honour mu&s;t admit to be true, and what I, permit me to &s;ay, feel, and, I hope, practi&s;e, in its &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e. Put the ca&s;e, by way of elu|cidation only, that I profe&s;s my&s;elf the ad|mirer of a lady of reputation; I am &s;mitten with her charms; in &s;hort, I am in love with her. Very well. Believing me to be a man of honour, &s;he allows me to make &s;uit to her; I gain her confidence, we'll &s;uppo&s;e, and &s;he begins to favour my &s;uit; &s;he &s;miles on my humble addre&s;&s;es."</Q>&mdash;Here a &s;oft glance from the bright eyes of Mi&s;s Fanny brought his Lord&s;hip's eloquence to a pau&s;e. He gently took her hand, and in a whi&s;per tenderly mur|mured&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Lovely creature, if you look upon me with tho&s;e eyes, I &s;hall forget every word
<PB N="14" REF="18">
I was &s;aying, every &s;en&s;e will be lo&s;t in ec&s;tacy and rapture."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Go on, go on,"</Q> &s;aid Fanny, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"I am much intere&s;ted in what you are &s;aying, and &s;hou'd be &s;orry to inter|rupt you in the mo&s;t important part of it."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Put me in then,"</Q> &s;aid the peer, <Q REND="inline">"for I pro|te&s;t to you I am lo&s;t."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why, you had ju&s;t gain'd the lady's affections,"</Q> replied Fanny; <Q REND="inline">"nay, I believe o'my con&s;cience you was going on too pro&s;perou&s;ly for her repo&s;e, un|le&s;s you was upon the &s;tricte&s;t honour."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"There you are rather before-hand with me,"</Q> re&s;umed my Lord, <Q REND="inline">"tho', I confe&s;s I was coming to the point: be it &s;o then! Let us for a moment &s;uppo&s;e that this lady, in pity to my &s;ufferings, or, if you will, in kind com|pliance with my importunate and empa&s;&s;ion'd &s;olicitations, generou&s;ly concedes tho&s;e favours, which are the greate&s;t woman can be&s;tow or man receive, can it for a moment be doubted that I am bound by all the ties of honour, gratitude and ju&s;tice, to indemnify the repu|tation of my benefactre&s;s? Heavens! I were the vile&s;t wretch that ever breath'd, cou'd I do le&s;s than tender her my heart, my hand, my name, rank, fortune, every thing that I po&s;&s;e&s;s on earth, as &s;oon as ever opportunity

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. An Excur&s;ion from Crowbery Ca&s;tle.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning both Phoebus and Sir Roger Man&s;tock had harne&s;&s;ed their &s;teeds, and advanced upon their journey be|fore the beauteous Mi&s;s Fanny broke the &s;oft bands of &s;leep a&s;under, and aro&s;e to renew her charms at the toilette. Her protracted &s;lumbers had &s;o far exceeded the accu&s;tomed hour of breakfa&s;t, that &s;he gave orders to her attendant to &s;erve her in her own apartment: polite enquiries were &s;ent up more than once by his Lord&s;hip, to which excu&s;es were returned of a &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition; in the mean time the following reflections aro&s;e in that gentle fair

one's mind, upon a review of pa&s;t occur|rences.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, to be &s;ure, there is &s;omething very captivating in a title, el&s;e this &s;ame Lord Crow|bery wou'd be in&s;upportable; I perceive I &s;hall be mo&s;t heartily &s;ick of him before the honey-moon is half out; I &s;hall never have the patience of his former lady; let him be|ware how he treats me in the manner he be|hav'd to her; I'll &s;oon &s;hew him that my &s;pirit is at lea&s;t as good as his own; he &s;han't &s;hut me up in this di&s;mal ca&s;tle, and nau&s;eate me with his &s;urfeiting fondne&s;s: &s;ure, of all vi&s;itations under heaven, that of a &s;tale doat|ing hu&s;band wou'd be the mo&s;t intolerable. Oh! Henry! Henry! why wou'd you reject me? Still, &s;till your image haunts me; my fond heart &s;till doats upon you, and wou'd &s;purn this odious creature and his titles with di&s;dain, cou'd I but gain your love. But hold! perhaps your di&s;appointment may have humbled you; all hopes now bla&s;ted, and I&s;a|bella thrown by fortune beyond the reach even of your meditations, who can tell but you are now regretting your own ob&s;tinacy, and wi&s;hing to recal that fatal hour, when mad with love, and fir'd with re&s;entment&mdash;
<PB N="19" REF="23">
Oh! horrible! I cannot name the re&s;t."</Q>&mdash;Here &s;he threw her&s;elf back in her chair, and, bur&s;ting into tears, fortunately found vent for a gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, that would el&s;e have thrown her into violent hy&s;terics. Again &s;he re&s;umed her &s;oliloquy&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What did my provoking uncle mean by &s;aying you mu&s;t marry Su&s;an May? No; that my Henry will never do. His &s;pirit never will &s;toop to that; it never &s;hall, if I have influence to prevent it. I'll &s;acrifice ambition, fortune, every thing to love. I have befool'd my&s;elf enough, too much, with this dete&s;ted lord; I &s;icken at his name; I'll ca&s;t him off for ever.&mdash;Stop! where is my fancy carrying me? There are &s;ome charms in title, rank and &s;plendour; they gratify ambition, and do not exclude love. I have gone much too far now to recede; I were a fool indeed to pay the purcha&s;e, and not reap the profit: I have him &s;ure, and I'll not let him loo&s;e. Vi&s;counte&s;s Crowbery will pique the pride of plain Mi&s;s Man&s;tock. Oh! 'twill be bitterne&s;s and gall to that old Baronet to &s;ee his niece's coronet upon my head; de|licious triumph! glorious revenge!"</Q></P>
<P>Thus whil&s;t her mind was fluctuating be|twixt contending pa&s;&s;ions, my Lord announced
<PB N="20" REF="24">
him&s;elf with a gentle tap at the door, and humbly a&s;ked admittance. It was granted, and as he approached her, he &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I ven|ture to a&s;&s;ume the privileges of a hu&s;band, and come to a&s;k, if you have any orders for the carriages or &s;ervants this morning, as I think the day is fine, and promi&s;es you a plea&s;ant airing. Henceforward, Madam, you command in this hou&s;e, and the humble&s;t of your &s;ervants is now in your pre&s;ence."</Q> This was an addre&s;s, that merited what it received, a gracious &s;mile, and threw a turning weight into the &s;cale of the addre&s;&s;er and his peerage, that made poverty and Henry kick the beam. This fair beginning was &s;till further advanced by a very &s;ea&s;onable auxiliary, in the &s;hape of a hand&s;ome brilliant, &s;et in a ring, which his Lord&s;hip with great gallantry put upon her wedding finger. The heart of Fanny Clay|pole was amenable to &s;o many pa&s;&s;ions, be&s;ides that of love in its common acceptation, that the donor of the ring could not fail to be de|lighted with the impre&s;&s;ion it had made; and as that young lady was a better actre&s;s than Lord Crowbery was a critic, it is not much to be wondered at, if, upon this occa&s;ion, he mi&s;took artifice for &s;incerity.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="25">After a few indi&s;pen&s;ible arrangements at the toilette, which my Lord was graciou&s;ly permitted to be a &s;pectator of, and which were not ill calculated to di&s;play her charms in the mo&s;t alluring attitudes, Fanny &s;ignified her intention of taking the air in a little ca|briole, drawn by one hor&s;e of gentle condi|tion, having been long in the habit of obeying the hand of a le&s;s daring driver, and order was given accordingly. Fanny had a &s;cheme in meditation, of paying a vi&s;it to Su&s;an May in the cour&s;e of her circuit, and for that rea&s;on cho&s;e it &s;hould be &s;olitary; &s;he therefore &s;et out, followed by a &s;ervant, leaving my Lord at home to meditate on his felicity, or di&s;|cu&s;s new topics of edification with his reverend gue&s;t, as they &s;trolled through the plantations and gardens.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Claypole, after a tour about the park, came upon the village green, and &s;topt at the gate of Su&s;an's man&s;ion, who &s;oon pre&s;ented her&s;elf, and very re&s;pectfully invited her into the hou&s;e. This was graciou&s;ly accepted by the Vi&s;counte&s;s elect, and after a few common que&s;tions had pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed, they fell upon the &s;ubject of Lady Crowbery's death, and then Mi&s;s Fanny demanded of Su&s;an, if
<PB N="22" REF="26">
&s;he had been informed of the circum&s;tances of her will: upon her an&s;wering in the negative, &s;he related to her the leading particulars, and ob&s;erved, with much a&s;&s;umed concern, that it was a matter mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing to her, how it came to pa&s;s Henry &s;hould be &s;o totally for|gotten, that even his name was not once men|tioned, nor any thing that could allude to a provi&s;ion for him recommended to the heire&s;s, even by the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint.</P>
<P>Su&s;an gazed with a&s;toni&s;hment upon her, as if in doubt whether &s;he was to yield credit to the account &s;he was giving of an event &s;o unexpected. <Q REND="inline">"If it is &s;o,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"and if my young lady is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate, and has it at her own di&s;po&s;al, I can only pre|&s;ume to &s;ay &s;he has a noble opportunity of being generous to the mo&s;t de&s;erving man upon earth; and I can't doubt but &s;he will avail her&s;elf of it."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I think of him as you do,"</Q> replied Mi&s;s Fanny; <Q REND="inline">"but our &s;enti|ments, my good friend, may not be every body's &s;entiments; they may not be Mi&s;s Man&s;tock's; and they certainly are not likely to be Sir Roger's.

<P><Q REND="inline">"They may &s;afely credit me,"</Q> replied Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o far as to &s;uppo&s;e I never can for|get to whom I am indebted for every thing I po&s;&s;e&s;s; I hope, therefore, I am capable of the gratitude they a&s;cribe to me, though not &s;o pre&s;umptuous as to annex to it the condi|tions which they &s;eem to allude to. No, Madam, be a&s;&s;ur'd I know him and my&s;elf too well, not to know that poverty can never &s;o depre&s;s him as to level him with me; the woman Mr. Henry marries mu&s;t not only be pure from guilt of her own contracting, but even from involuntary &s;tains, which you well know I am not. I believe, Madam, even levity of behaviour, and a forward carriage in the per&s;on he might el&s;e have admir'd, wou'd change his liking into di&s;gu&s;t, tho' &s;he had every other charm that cou'd attract him."</Q></P>
<P>Here it is &s;uppo&s;ed that Mi&s;s Fanny would
<PB N="24" REF="28">
have blu&s;hed, if art had not been before|hand with nature, and dipt her pencil in the counterfeited tint of mode&s;ty and &s;hame. But though nature was barred from one avenue, &s;he found vent at another; and whil&s;t con&s;cious recollection &s;mote her heart, her tongue be|trayed how ju&s;tly &s;he applied the ob&s;ervation to her&s;elf. <Q REND="inline">"I can readily under&s;tand,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"where your remark points, and what per&s;on I am to thank as the founder of it; for &s;ervants are very apt to retail the &s;candal that their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es propagate. I know there have been very impertinent &s;tories circulated about me; but I wou'd have you, and every one el&s;e concern'd with you, to be a&s;&s;ur'd, that my re|putation is not to be &s;lander'd with impunity: I have friends, Mrs. Su&s;an, that will make tho&s;e tremble who attempt it; and, I believe, you will &s;oon be convinc'd, that if it is your wi&s;h to live here, and enjoy your newly ac|quir'd fortune in peace and quiet, you will be extremely cautious how you &s;uffer any ex|pre&s;&s;ions to e&s;cape you, that can be con&s;trued to impute the &s;malle&s;t indi&s;cretion to my con|duct."</Q></P>
<P>With the&s;e words, the lady elect made her exit with all due dignity, and without vouch|&s;afing

a word more, or even a look to Su&s;an, who attended her to the &s;tep of her cabriole, where &s;he replaced her&s;elf in her &s;eat, and pur&s;ued her way towards the ca&s;tle.</P>

I have here a letter from our friend
<PB N="26" REF="30">
Henry, which announces the death of our re|&s;pected Lady Crowbery. It is dated from Falmouth, which I under&s;tand to be the port from whence &s;he was to have embark'd for Li&s;bon. It plea&s;ed the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er of all events to call her to him&s;elf from this world of &s;orrow by a &s;wift me&s;&s;enger. Be it &s;o! we mu&s;t all obey the &s;ummons, &s;ome &s;ooner, &s;ome later: it is in vain to lament. She was a pious and a charitable lady, and the poor have lo&s;t a friend, which, I fear, will not be replaced to them by that young madam at lea&s;t, who, as common fame reports, is de&s;tin'd to be her &s;ucce&s;&s;or at the ca&s;tle. As the Lady Crowbery died in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very ample pa|trimony in her own right, we may now expect to hear that our beloved Henry is rewarded for his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and made independent for his life: of this I am &s;ure, that the decea&s;ed lady was much too ju&s;t to di&s;appoint the hopes &s;he had in&s;pir'd him with, and far too di&s;cerning to overlook his merits, and therefore, child, take notice, I predict a very ample provi&s;ion for our ab&s;ent friend."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That is a very natural prediction for you to make,"</Q> cried Su&s;an; <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h I cou'd &s;ay it was a true one; but alas, alas, my good

I pronounce it im|po&s;&s;ible for the Lady Crowbery to be a de|ceiver, a dealer in fal&s;e promi&s;es, and a hypo|crite at the hour of death, and therefore I reject your information, and abide by my pre|diction. What, child, will you tell me that I don't know what is in human nature, that I &s;hou'd be made the bubble and the dupe of &s;uch a prating minx as that Mi&s;s Clay|pole, who never yet utter'd one truth of Henry &s;ince &s;he knew him? Don't we know enough of her dark dealings, not to take her word in any ca&s;e where he is concern'd? Did not I tell you that &s;he came for no good pur|po&s;e? and now you &s;ee I did not &s;peak lightly and without good rea&s;on; learn from this, child, I exhort you, not to tru&s;t too confident|ly to your own ra&s;h opinions, but li&s;ten to tho&s;e who have more knowledge and expe|rience than your&s;elf."</Q></P>

<P>What were the preci&s;e &s;en&s;ations that the&s;e la&s;t words &s;tirred in the gentle bo&s;om of the attentive hearer, we do not pretend to divine, but &s;omething there was either in the found or in the &s;en&s;e of them that &s;uffu&s;ed her face with blu&s;hes, which Doctor Daw, notwith|&s;tanding his prodigious &s;kill and penetration, ju&s;t then happened to overlook, &s;o that there

was time for them to fade away into a deadly pale, which &s;ucceeded without attracting the notice of the afore&s;aid &s;agacious critic in the human character. How he was employed whil&s;t the&s;e changes were in tran&s;ition, we are not minutely informed; but &s;urely not in the contemplation of one of the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive countenances in nature, el&s;e the &s;cenery there di&s;played could hardly have e&s;caped him, though the &s;ecret &s;pring that gave movement to it, might have puzzled him to find out.</P>
<P>Now it had &s;o happened in the reading of Mi&s;s Man&s;tock's letter, as it has happened in the ca&s;es of many other readings, that her two commentators, Ezekiel Daw and Su&s;an May, had two different methods of interpreting the &s;ame text; the preacher making it conform to his own prediction, and Su&s;an con&s;truing it according to her own fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of the fact: whil&s;t the one therefore believed Henry very richly provided for, the other per&s;uaded her&s;elf he was not worth a doit. Now the reader perhaps may recollect that Mi&s;s Fanny, who communicated the intelligence of his be|ing left out of Lady Crowbery's will, threw out a hint at a report, which &s;addled him upon Su&s;an for a moiety of her means; and
<PB N="32" REF="36">
though Su&s;an in&s;tantly returned an an&s;wer, which, we hope, was proper for the occa&s;ion, and well becoming her to make, yet it is not unnatural to &s;uppo&s;e that it might rai&s;e &s;ome ideas in her mind, which &s;he did not hold her|&s;elf bound to communicate, either to Mi&s;s Fanny, or even to Doctor Daw him&s;elf. Combining, therefore, the&s;e ideas with the concluding paragraph in Henry's letter, that he had <HI>&s;omething for her private ear,</HI> we may find a clue to the &s;en&s;ations that occa&s;ioned Su&s;an's change of countenance at the hearing of that paragraph. As to the con&s;equences which this ab&s;traction of thought on her part had with re&s;pect to Ezekiel, they were only tho&s;e of affording him free &s;cope for talking upon any &s;ubject he thought fit, whil&s;t &s;he meditated upon another, a privilege he fre|quently enjoyed in the company of his friends without finding it out.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V. Our Hi&s;tory &s;hifts the Scene.</HEAD>
<P>WE now turn our attention to the lovely I&s;abella, who, on the &s;econd day from her leaving Man&s;tock, arrived with her father at the ancient &s;eat of the Adamants, called Hagley Hall. It was a &s;tately though irre|gular pile of building, in the Gothic &s;tile but in perfect repair, with a hand&s;ome park about it and a fine command of water. Lady Crow|bery had always kept up a &s;ufficient e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of &s;ervants, by who&s;e care every thing was in good order to receive their expected vi&s;itants, though the melancholy occa&s;ion that brought them there, kept the neighbours and tenants, whom curio&s;ity or re&s;pect would el&s;e have a&s;&s;embled, from intruding on their pri|vacy. One old gentleman, the rector of the pari&s;h and well known to Sir Roger, pre&s;ent|ed him&s;elf on their arrival, of which he had been appri&s;ed by letter from the Baronet. He had been long the admini&s;trator of all affairs at Hagley Hall, and the appearance of the place
<PB N="34" REF="38">
bore te&s;timony to his care. This worthy per|&s;on (by name and title Doctor Sandford) was greatly affected at the meeting with Sir Roger and the heire&s;s, who&s;e tears kept pace with his on the occa&s;ion: he informed them that a me&s;&s;enger had arrived to appri&s;e him that the body might be expected the next day; where|upon the day following was &s;ettled between him and Sir Roger for the ceremony of inter|ment.</P>
<P>It was about the hour of dinner when Sir Roger arrived at Hagley Hall, and Doctor Sandford had provided for their entertainment. His company was a &s;ea&s;onable relief to the worthy Baronet, who, to his great concern, &s;aw his beloved I&s;abella much depre&s;&s;ed in &s;pirits; and though he did his be&s;t to comfort her, yet whil&s;t the painful &s;ecret of her lover's birth hung on her mind, it cannot be wondered at if all his kind endeavours failed of their effect.</P>
<P>After dinner, however, &s;he kept her &s;eat at the table with her father and Doctor Sandford, with who&s;e company &s;he was greatly plea&s;ed; and in truth he was an amiable and excellent man. In the cour&s;e of their conver&s;ation, they fell upon the &s;ubject of Mr. Ratcliffe's death,
<PB N="35" REF="39">
who&s;e pari&s;h adjoined to Hagley, and who&s;e preferment was yet undi&s;po&s;ed of. His par|&s;onage hou&s;e was &s;till unoccupied, bur the duty of the church was executed for the time by Doctor Sandford's &s;on, a young man edu|cated at the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, and lately admitted into prie&s;t's orders. In &s;peak|ing of the melancholy event of poor Ratcliffe's &s;udden death, the good Doctor expatiated on the virtuous and amiable qualities of his late neighbour and friend with great &s;en&s;ibility, bewailing the irreparable lo&s;s which his pa|ri&s;hioners had &s;uffered, but avoiding with great delicacy the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint of any expecta|tion for his &s;on. The &s;tronge&s;t &s;olicitation would probably have been le&s;s efficacious than this very delicacy, which did by no means e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of his hearers. I&s;abella expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">f vi&s;iting the de&s;erted man&s;ion of Mr. Ratcliffe before &s;he left the country; the contemplation of it, as the re|&s;idence of &s;o good a man, would impre&s;s her mind with melancholy awe and veneration. Sir Roger combined other impre&s;&s;ions in his interpretation of this de&s;ire; but Doctor Sand|ford, who did not dive quite &s;o deep into her
<PB N="36" REF="40">
motives, proceeded to &s;ay, that much as he lamented the lo&s;s of his friend Ratcliffe, there was yet another rea&s;on with him, that made it a mo&s;t gloomy &s;pectacle in his &s;ight; <Q REND="inline">"I al|lude,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"to the &s;udden and unaccount|able di&s;appearance of a youth called Henry, who, under very my&s;terious circum&s;tances, was rear'd and educated from infancy to manhood by that excellent man."</Q> A look of marked at|tention from I&s;abella, cau&s;ed him to apply his di&s;|cour&s;e more immediately to her, and he proceed|ed to &s;ay&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ah! Madam, to me, who knew this young man, and regarded him as a crea|ture little &s;hort of perfection in mind, per&s;on and manners, the lo&s;s of him without any tidings of his fate, is one of the heavie&s;t re|flections which my heart can mu&s;e upon. He was devoted to his patron and preceptor, and at his death &s;eemed to have vani&s;h'd like a gho&s;t: whither he went, and what may have befallen him, Heaven only knows; but if hu|man virtue merits a peculiar Providence, &s;urely that youth, &s;o lo&s;t to us, will be the object of Heaven's care."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your prediction is verified,"</Q> cried Sir Roger, and immediately turning to I&s;abella,
<PB N="37" REF="41">
who was pale as a&s;hes, tendered a gla&s;s of water, which perhaps was &s;eldom if ever more critically applied.</P>
<P>Dr. Sandford, &s;urpri&s;ed at this alarm, gazed upon I&s;abella and her father, like a man who perceives he has done mi&s;chief, and neither knows what nor how.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I hope,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I have given no offence, it is purely unintentional, if I have."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Not the lea&s;t,"</Q> cried Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"not the lea&s;t offence, good &s;ir, but quite the contrary; we think of this young man as highly as you do; we know him well, and we love him much."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I re|joice to hear it,"</Q> cried Sandford, <Q REND="inline">"from my heart, I rejoice to hear that the young man is under your protection: Heaven has indeed been bountiful in granting him &s;o good a friend!"</Q></P>
<P>It was at this very moment that I&s;abella, though agitated by a variety of thoughts, con|ceived the re&s;olution of &s;ugge&s;ting to her fa|ther the nomination of young Sandford to Mr. Ratcliffe's vacancy, and to back it with all her influence. No &s;ooner had &s;he rallied her &s;pirits, than her eyes directed &s;uch a glowing beam of gratitude and benevolence towards tho&s;e of the good old Doctor, that he
<PB N="38" REF="42">
mu&s;t have been blind indeed if he had not &s;een, and dull as death if he had not under&s;tood the language of that look. He was neither void of &s;ight or &s;en&s;e, but &s;ufficiently quick in both, to perceive that he had given plea&s;ure by his prai&s;e of Henry, to one of the mo&s;t beau|tiful and not the lea&s;t &s;en&s;itive objects in crea|tion; and he was not &s;low to conclude, that where &s;o much joy was cau&s;ed &s;ome affection mu&s;t exi&s;t; he therefore ventured to enquire where his favourite was to be found. To this I&s;abella replied, by giving a &s;hort narrative of his &s;tory, which left him at Falmouth, beyond which her information did not enable her to proceed,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then I'll engage we &s;hall &s;ee him here,"</Q> &s;aid the Doctor, <Q REND="inline">"and I hope, if he comes, he will gratify me &s;o far as to make my hou&s;e his home, which will be matter of peculiar joy to my poor &s;on, who has beat the whole country round in &s;earch of him, till de&s;pair has driven him from the attempt."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I hope then,"</Q> cried I&s;abella, <Q REND="inline">"you will lo&s;e no time in giving Mr. Sandford the in|formation &s;o agreeable to him."</Q>&mdash;Here &s;he was joined by Sir Roger, who &s;o cordially de|&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ed a &s;ervant might be in&s;tantly &s;ent off to invite him, that the old man, who confe&s;&s;ed he
<PB N="39" REF="43">
was hard by at the par&s;onage, con&s;ented with no &s;mall plea&s;ure to the &s;ummons; and if that fatherly plea&s;ure needed a ju&s;tification, the ap|pearance of young Sandford, which a few mi|nutes produced, very effectually afforded it, for he was in per&s;on, manners and addre&s;s, a &s;on to be proud of.</P>
<P>I&s;abella's warm heart immediately accorded to him; he was the friend of Henry; that was enough: the blaze of beauty, that good humour threw upon her enchanting counte|nance as &s;he welcomed him with &s;miles, &s;o dazzled him upon his fir&s;t introduction to her, that his admiration re&s;embled awkwardne&s;s, and he &s;carce knew how to addre&s;s him&s;elf to her; the charms of her voice, and the en|couraging &s;weetne&s;s of her manner, &s;oon put him at his ea&s;e, without dimini&s;hing his re|&s;pect. The company now naturally cla&s;&s;ed them&s;elves according to their ages, and whil&s;t the fathers fell into di&s;cour&s;e upon matters of bu&s;ine&s;s, the young people entertained each other upon topics more &s;uitable to their ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip for Henry on one part, and love on the other, were not long in agreeing upon what that topic &s;hould be, and it &s;oon became
<PB N="40" REF="44">
manife&s;t that the hi&s;tory of our hero's ad|ventures was reciprocally the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ubject they could talk upon. I&s;abella again went over the account, enlarging upon it with many more particulars than &s;he had thought nece&s;&s;ary to recite in her fir&s;t narration; but there was now only one hearer, and to him every circum&s;tance was new; to &s;ay that he heard her with delight, is to do ju&s;tice to but one of his &s;en&s;es, when there was another at lea&s;t in full occupation, which filled his heart with rapture, and would have made <HI>the dulle&s;t tale of &s;orrow plea&s;ing.</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What voice do I hear?"</Q> &s;aid he, within him&s;elf; <Q REND="inline">"what vi&s;ion do I behold? She breathes through rows of pearls over beds of ro&s;es. 'Tis an enchant|ment! &s;he will vani&s;h pre&s;ently, and I &s;hall &s;tart out of my trance."</Q></P>
<P>When I&s;abella had brought her hi&s;tory to a clo&s;e, young Sandford remained &s;ilent for &s;ome time, as if unwilling to take the di&s;cour&s;e from one whom he had li&s;tened to with &s;uch delight; at la&s;t, perceiving that &s;he expected a reply, he thanked her for the entertainment &s;he had vouch&s;afed him, every circum&s;tance of which had been very highly intere&s;ting to
<PB N="41" REF="45">
him, who&s;e mind had been &s;o long kept in anxious &s;u&s;pen&s;e about the fate of a friend, who was de&s;ervedly &s;o dear to him. <Q REND="inline">"I al|ways lov'd Henry,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"from a boy, and though there were &s;ome years between us, yet his manly character, his command of temper, and excellent under&s;tanding, gave him advantages which my greater maturity of age and experience could not compen&s;ate for: on many occa&s;ions I have profited by his better judgment, not unfrequently by his friendly reproof, and more than once have been very &s;eriou&s;ly indebted to his zealous &s;pirit and undaunted gallantry: I hear therefore of his behaviour in the fight at &s;ea with much more plea&s;ure than &s;urpri&s;e; for I believe nothing braver lives on earth; but there is withal a tenderne&s;s and candour in his nature, that en|dear him to our hearts, as much as his more brilliant qualities entitle him to our admira|tion. If ever that day &s;hall come to pa&s;s, when the clouds that ob&s;cure his birth &s;hall di&s;per&s;e, I am per&s;uaded it will be found that he is of noble de&s;cent, and &s;hould the &s;ame good fortune rai&s;e him to affluence and an ele|vated &s;ituation, I am certain there is no &s;phere

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI. A &s;hort Excur&s;ion leads to an important Interview.</HEAD>
<P>AT the expected time arrived the body of the decea&s;ed Lady Crowbery, properly attended, and followed by a numerous com|pany of the tenants and pea&s;ants appertaining to the e&s;tate. There is no need for us to de|&s;cribe the &s;olemn pageantry of a funeral, it will &s;uffice to &s;ay, that the mortal remains of one of the meeke&s;t and mo&s;t benevolent of God's creatures were committed to the vault of her ance&s;tors, with every ceremonious rite that could mark the re&s;pect of her &s;urviving friends, and every tribute of unfeigned &s;orrow that could te&s;tify their affection. The &s;ervice was performed by the reverend Dr. Sandford, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his &s;on, and the body was followed by Sir Roger Man&s;tock and I&s;abella chief
<PB N="43" REF="47">
mourners: a great concour&s;e of &s;pectators were a&s;&s;embled, among&s;t whom two &s;trangers in hor&s;emens' loo&s;e coats, were con&s;picuous for the eagerne&s;s with which they pre&s;&s;ed for|wards at the interment of the body, as well as for the intere&s;t they appeared to take in that affecting ceremony: deep affliction &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s them wholly, and as they held their handkerchiefs to their faces all the while the &s;ervice was performing, none of tho&s;e who&s;e attention was drawn towards them (and they were not a few) could get a &s;ight of their faces, or learn by any enquiry who they were. After the &s;ervice was over they &s;eparated them&s;elves from the crowd, mounted their hor&s;es, and rode off with &s;peed.</P>
<P>There was one however in that mournful a&s;&s;embly, who&s;e attention had not been &s;o to|tally engro&s;&s;ed by his &s;hare in it, as not to catch a &s;udden glimp&s;e of the&s;e &s;trangers, which led him to a pretty confident conjecture as to the per&s;on of one of them. It was young Sandford who had made this ob&s;ervation, and upon the fir&s;t opportunity which offered of his &s;peaking to I&s;abella apart, he communicated to her his per&s;ua&s;ion that he had di&s;covered his friend Henry among&s;t the croud, di&s;|gui&s;ed
<PB N="44" REF="48">
in a clowni&s;h dre&s;s, and accompanied by another per&s;on in the like habit. The pro|bability immediately &s;truck her, though &s;he her&s;elf had not made any ob&s;ervation upon the &s;pectators, general or particular.</P>
<P>We forgot to mention in its proper place, that we had a friend among&s;t the mourners, Zachary Cawdle by name, who had accom|panied the hear&s;e all the way from Falmouth in an attendant coach: he was now lodged in Hagley Hall, and it is hardly to be &s;uppo&s;ed that our fair heroine had failed to make cer|tain enquiries of him, which might now have made any further que&s;tions about Henry's ap|pearance at the funeral unnece&s;&s;ary; but the fact was, that the&s;e enquiries had not pro|duced any other information from hone&s;t Za|chary, except that Henry, accompanied by a gentleman who called him&s;elf Smith, had parted from him at Falmouth, di&s;clo&s;ing no|thing more of his future plan, than that he would be at Crowbery within &s;uch a time, and hoped to meet him there upon a certain bu&s;i|ne&s;s; to this Zachary added, under the &s;eal of &s;ecrecy, that the &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">amed Mr. Smith was veritably that identical Mr. Delapoer, from whom Lady Crowbery was re&s;cued by her fa|ther
<PB N="45" REF="49">
within a &s;tage of Gretna Green, and who had been ever &s;ince in the Ea&s;t Indies, from whence he was lately returned with an affluent fortune. Here Zachary &s;topt, and with a &s;a|gacious look eyed the young lady, who&s;e knowledge of the &s;ecret in his keeping &s;up|plied all the re&s;t, which he in ju&s;tice to his tru&s;t &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>All this I&s;abella had gained from Zachary within a few hours after his arrival, &s;o that when Mr. Sandford imparted to her his &s;up|po&s;ed di&s;covery of Henry, in company with a per&s;on unknown, her own &s;ugge&s;tions readi|ly found a name for that per&s;on, without re|&s;orting to Zachary for any further intelligence. There was one reflection I&s;abella drew from this account, that was con&s;olatory to her mind in its pre&s;ent &s;tate of anxious &s;u&s;pen&s;e&mdash;Hen|ry had found a father, and under all events was probably &s;ecured again&s;t any future dan|ger of experiencing di&s;tre&s;s of circum&s;tances: this con&s;ideration al&s;o helped her to account in &s;ome degree for her cou&s;in's &s;ilence in her will, an omi&s;&s;ion otherwi&s;e both inexplicable, and in her &s;en&s;e of it inexcu&s;eable.</P>
<P>It had occurred to Sandford, and he &s;ug|ge&s;ted it to I&s;abella, that it was likely Henry
<PB N="46" REF="50">
would be found &s;omewhere in or about the hou&s;e of his decea&s;ed benefactor Ratcliffe; and the probability of this &s;o &s;truck that young lady, as to determine her upon putting her projected vi&s;it to that man&s;ion into immediate execution. She accordingly, with her father's con&s;ent, obtained his chai&s;e for an airing, and immediately directed it to the point &s;he had in view; fortunately for her purpo&s;e &s;he was alone, and whil&s;t her heart throbbed with the hopes of meeting the deare&s;t object of its thoughts, reflecting upon the difficulties that darkened all her views of happine&s;s, &s;he trem|bled as &s;he approached the &s;pot, and dreaded what &s;he mo&s;t de&s;ired, an interview with Henry. At the bottom of a little hanging garden, in front of a neat but humble man&s;ion, her carriage &s;topt and &s;he got out. A little wicket in a low &s;horn hedge-row of horn|beam was open, and admitted her into the garden; the &s;lope was rather &s;teep, and &s;he &s;lowly &s;auntered up it gazing about her on each &s;ide, and &s;urveying the &s;mall but intere&s;ting &s;cene with a pen&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility. She was no|ticed by an old woman, who pre&s;ented her&s;elf at the hou&s;e door, and a&s;ked her commands: I&s;abella &s;aid &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;ee the rooms, and
<PB N="47" REF="51">
that it was not idle curio&s;ity, but re&s;pect for the memory of the late inhabitant had brought her thither.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then pray, madam, walk in and welcome, perhaps you belong to the dear young gentleman who is now in the hou&s;e, and &s;ure enough I am the happie&s;t creature living to &s;ee him &s;afe and once more among&s;t us, after being lo&s;t &s;o long: he is in the little back parlour, which was my late ma&s;ter's &s;tudy, all alone, and there he has been the&s;e two long hours, forbidding me to interrupt him, though I wou'd fain have come in and kept him company, in hopes to have chear'd him a bit, for I know he mu&s;t be melancholy to think of the days he pa&s;s'd in that room with my dear good dead ma&s;ter, who lov'd him as if he had been the father of him."</Q></P>
<P>This intelligence &s;o agitated the tender &s;pirits of I&s;abella, that &s;he pau&s;ed in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and for a while &s;tood mu&s;ing what to do. At length, having re&s;olved to proceed, &s;he de&s;ired to be &s;hewn the room where the gentleman was; the old woman conducted her through a little ve&s;tibule into a plain neat parlour, and there pointing to a door that was oppo&s;ite to the windows, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"That is my late ma&s;ter's &s;tudy; there Mr. Henry is."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="52">I&s;abella de&s;ired to be left, and when the dame had di&s;appeared &s;he approached the door, and with a trembling hand turned the lock, and pre&s;ented to the &s;ight of Henry an object &s;o welcome and &s;o unexpected, that &s;tarting with ec&s;ta&s;y from his &s;eat he exclaim|ed, <Q REND="inline">"Good Heavens! do I behold Mi&s;s Man&s;tock? May I believe my eyes? Are you alone?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am here alone,"</Q> &s;he replied, whil&s;t blu&s;hes over&s;pread her face; <Q REND="inline">"and I confe&s;s my purpo&s;e was to find you out. I heard you was pre&s;ent at a mournful meeting: you was di&s;cover'd, Henry, but not by me."</Q></P>
<P>He approached her re&s;pectfully; took her hand, and tenderly pre&s;&s;ed his lips upon it. It was vi&s;ible that he had been in tears, his eyes were red with weeping. He fixt them on her with a look &s;o full of love and tran&s;port, as cau&s;ed the timid &s;en&s;ibility of I&s;abella to &s;hrink back and retire a few &s;teps, which in|&s;tantly ob&s;erving he recollected him&s;elf, and in the milde&s;t accent be&s;eeched her to believe he knew the di&s;tance he &s;hould keep in pre|&s;ence of &s;uch purity. <Q REND="inline">"But if I had the power,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"by words to paint to you how beautiful you are, how exqui&s;itely charm|ing

<P><Q REND="inline">"I have no fears,"</Q> &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"I com|mit my&s;elf to you with perfect confidence; and gladly &s;eize the opportunity of conver&s;ing with you in private, anxious to a&s;&s;ure you that my heart remains unalter'd, that it &s;ympa|thizes with you in your &s;orrows, in your joys; for if you have lo&s;t a mother, Henry, I am told you have found a father, and that I hope, in &s;ome degree, will balance your affliction. As to this e&s;tate, which I con&s;ider my&s;elf as holding in tru&s;t for your u&s;e, I have only con|jecture to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in my interpretation of my cou&s;in's will, having receiv'd no private in|&s;tructions from her before her death; therefore I conjure you, Henry, if you know her wi&s;hes, impart them to me fully and without re&s;erve: I am confident it cou'd not be her purpo&s;e to pa&s;s you over, and heap an u&s;ele&s;s fortune in your wrong on me."</Q></P>

Let me &s;ink into ob&s;curity without a name, which only can di&s;grace the memory of my unhappy mother, and give cau&s;e of triumph to her cruel pe&s;ecutor, who &s;urvives her: perhaps my I&s;abella's father wou'd be wounded in his pride of family, if I were publi&s;h'd to the world the heir of Lady Crowbery and the &s;on of Delapoer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Henry,"</Q> cried I&s;abella, eagerly interrupt|ing him, <Q REND="inline">"you &s;trike upon the very circum|&s;tance that cau&s;es all my terror and di&s;tre&s;s: my father's feelings are exactly what you &s;up|po&s;e them to be; and all the oppo&s;ition he ever gave to your preten&s;ions, aro&s;e from the &s;u&s;|picion he entertain'd of your being the &s;on of his niece. He now, from the nature of my cou&s;in's will, is per&s;uaded to the contrary of that &s;u&s;picion, and is become your cordial friend: knowing, therefore, that he is now acting towards you under the impre&s;&s;ion of a mi&s;taken conclu&s;ion, what a &s;ituation am I in!

To avail my&s;elf of his delu&s;ion, and carry on a deceit again&s;t him, is what my nature revolts from; to undeceive him and reveal a &s;ecret I have pledged my&s;elf to keep, is what I cannot do: hard indeed is that dilemma which puts me under equal difficulties, whether I re&s;ort to &s;ilence or confe&s;&s;ion.

Their motive for this generous &s;acrifice has been extreme delicacy towards my me|mory; and mine for complying with it has been confidence in your ju&s;tice, and a per|fect conviction that my Henry lives but in the hope of &s;haring life and all its intere&s;ts with you. If this happy union takes place all will be well, and my &s;pirit &s;hall re&s;t in peace: if not, alas! no wealth can profit him; nothing that I can give will &s;ave him from de&s;pair.

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII. The Di&s;covery of a po&s;thumous Paper cau&s;es great Sen&s;ations.</HEAD>
<P>THE death of Lady Crowbery had &s;o deeply affected Delapoer, that Henry &s;aw with concern a very vi&s;ible alteration in his &s;tate of health, and a fixt melancholy that &s;eemed to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him wholly. Ba|lancing between duty and inclination, he &s;carce knew how to decide with re&s;pect to I&s;abella's tempting invitation. Upon di&s;cour&s;ing with his father, however, he found him &s;o re&s;olved to take up his abode in the neighbourhood of Hagley, that he immediately began to ca&s;t about in his thoughts for &s;ome fit place for him to re&s;ide in; and it &s;oon occurred to him that the very hou&s;e, where his late happy inter|view with I&s;abella had taken place, would be
<PB N="60" REF="64">
of all &s;ituations mo&s;t de&s;irable, if that pre|ferment &s;hould devolve upon any per&s;on un|encumbered with a family: this idea, by a very natural tran&s;ition, &s;ugge&s;ted to him the probability of his friend young Sandford's being thought of for that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and as he entertained a very high opinion of his merit, he determined to employ his intere&s;t with I&s;a|bella in his behalf.</P>
<P>This idea Henry communicated to his fa|ther, and found him &s;o eager to embrace it, and &s;o pre&s;&s;ing for him to lo&s;e no time in vi&s;iting Sir Roger Man&s;tock, that he &s;et out for Hagley Hall without delay; here he re|ceived a very cordial welcome from the worthy Baronet, whom he found alone, and already appri&s;ed of his coming by I&s;abella. Speak|ing of his niece's death, Sir Roger took notice to Henry of his being overlooked in her will as a matter that cau&s;ed &s;ome &s;urprize, and which he could not well account for, having heard the decea&s;ed more than once declare her intentions of providing for him at her death; adding, that he con&s;idered him&s;elf as heir to tho&s;e intentions, and telling him not to be ca&s;t down, for in his friend&s;hip he &s;hould find a re&s;ource again&s;t all di&s;appointments.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="65">To this Henry made an&s;wer, that the excel|lent Lady alluded to, who always acted from the be&s;t and pure&s;t motives, had faithfully ful|filled all promi&s;es &s;he had ever made him, and that his grateful re&s;pect for her memory would never cea&s;e but with life it&s;elf. He thanked Sir Roger for the offer of his friend&s;hip, which he accepted as the highe&s;t honour he could a&s;pire to, and which he would &s;tudy to merit and pre&s;erve by every effort in his pow|er; favours of any other &s;ort, he flattered him&s;elf he &s;hould not &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>Here their conver&s;ation was cut &s;hort by the arrival of Doctor Sandford, who had not been many minutes in the room, before Henry had the &s;atisfaction to hear Sir Roger Man&s;tock acquaint him, that, with his daughter's con|currence, he had determined to nominate his &s;on to the living late enjoyed by the Reverend Mr. Ratcliffe. The good man expre&s;&s;ed a lively &s;en&s;e of gratitude on this occa&s;ion, and his happine&s;s &s;eemed complete.</P>
<P>Henry, in a private conver&s;ation with his friend Zachary Cawdle, revived the &s;ubject of Billy Williams; and as Zachary was now de|termined upon retiring from bu&s;ine&s;s on his annuity bequeathed to him by Lady Crowbery,
<PB N="62" REF="66">
he very readily engaged to make over his &s;hop and effects to Williams, upon fair and equitable terms, which &s;hould be adju&s;ted when that gentleman &s;hould obtain a di&s;|charge from his &s;hip, and make his appearance at Crowbery, for which place Zachary intend|ed to &s;et out the next morning. This matter being &s;ettled to Henry's entire content, for he was much attached to Williams, Zachary be|gan to &s;peak of matters more immediately in|tere&s;ting; and turning to our hero, he &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"In this very room where we are now &s;itting, I brought you into the world; and &s;urely it is now full time you &s;hould a&s;&s;ume &s;ome proper name and &s;tation in &s;ociety. Life is uncer|tain; and though, thank God, I feel my&s;elf &s;tout and hearty at this pre&s;ent moment, yet we are all liable to ca&s;ualties, and nobody can &s;ay how long it may be before I follow your good mo|ther, in which ca&s;e you wou'd lo&s;e a witne&s;s to your birth, who&s;e te&s;timony is mo&s;t material. You have a father, it is true, who&s;e fortune can in &s;ome re&s;pect indemnify you for the di&s;intere&s;ted, and give me leave to call it, the wanton &s;acrifice you have made of this noble property, which had el&s;e been your's; but that father a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, if I have any &s;kill in my profe&s;|&s;&s;ion,

is in a very precarious &s;tate of health; his &s;pirits &s;ink, and his con&s;titution threatens &s;wift decay. It behoves you therefore, my dear Henry, to look about you: if you have put a&s;ide your inheritance, in the hope of &s;har|ing it with the amiable young lady who now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, methinks you wou'd do well to lo&s;e no time in bringing that expectancy to bear; and why you &s;hou'd per&s;i&s;t in concealing your&s;elf from Sir Roger Man&s;tock, who &s;eems to be &s;o favourably di&s;pos'd, and enter|tains you with &s;uch kindne&s;s and regard, is what I cannot under&s;tand. You'll pardon me for the freedom I take in talking to you on a &s;ubject, in which I am no otherwi&s;e con|cern'd, but as my friend&s;hip and good wi&s;hes intere&s;t me in every thing that relates to you; for in truth, dear Henry, I have a very warm and tender heart towards you, and ever had from the fir&s;t moment fortune threw you in my way."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your zeal,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"can &s;tand in need of no apology; and I am free to confe&s;s to you, that my &s;ituation with re&s;pect to Sir Roger Man&s;tock bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">mes every hour more and more irk&s;ome to me, as every &s;pecies of di&s;gui&s;e mu&s;t be. When I know that I am
<PB N="64" REF="68">
indebted to a mi&s;conception for the kindne&s;s he &s;hews me, I cannot enjoy the fruits of it with content. It blights the happine&s;s I &s;hou'd el&s;e receive in the &s;ociety of the lovelie&s;t of women; and though I have every rea&s;on to fear that the di&s;covery of my birth wou'd be in&s;tantly follow'd by my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from every hope that points towards an alliance with his amiable daughter, yet my con&s;cience &s;o revolts again&s;t deceit, that I will &s;ooner meet the wor&s;t of misfortunes, and embrace de&s;pair, than per&s;i&s;t to act the counterfeit, as I have hitherto been compell'd to do. You therefore &s;ee, my worthy friend, how entirely my feelings coin|cide with your coun&s;el; and I am re&s;olv'd, with I&s;abella's leave, to-morrow &s;hall not pa&s;s without an explanation on my part: let me then reque&s;t, that you will not &s;et out upon your journey, till that event is over, as it cannot fail to happen that we &s;hall appeal to you."</Q></P>
<P>Zachary &s;ignified his perfect compliance with this reque&s;t, and Henry declared his re|&s;olution accordingly. An occurrence in the mean time had come to pa&s;s, which anticipat|ed all the con&s;equences incidental to that re|&s;olution. Sir Roger Man&s;tock, whil&s;t di&s;|cour&s;ing
<PB N="65" REF="69">
with Doctor Sandford upon &s;ome particulars relative to the living intended for his &s;on, had occa&s;ion to refer to &s;ome papers of the late Mr. Ratcliffe, which the Doctor told him were to be found in a certain old-fa&s;hioned cabinet, where he him&s;elf had de|po&s;ited them upon the death of that gentle|man, and of which he kept the key. The papers were ea&s;ily found; but in taking them out, it appeared to Sir Roger, that there was &s;ome &s;ecret machinery at the bottom of the cell, in which they laid, for hiding money or valuables in a &s;mall compa&s;s; and upon a clo&s;er &s;crutiny, a joint was di&s;covered, which, upon the in&s;ertion of a penknife, was made to &s;lide back, and in it was found a &s;mall packet folded in the form of a letter un&s;ealed. Upon opening this packet, Sir Roger immediately recognized the hand-writing of his brother-in-law Sir Stephen Adamant, and read as fol|lows:</P>
<Q>Particulars relative to my daughter Ce|cilia, to be communicated to her uncle, Sir Roger Man&s;tock, after my decea&s;e.</Q>
<P>This title he read aloud, and here he pau&s;ed, clo&s;ing the paper, and ob&s;erving to his companion, that it was a very extraordinary
<PB N="66" REF="70">
and to him a very intere&s;ting di&s;covery. <Q REND="inline">"I confe&s;s to you,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"my curio&s;ity is highly agitated, nay &s;o much am I affected by the &s;uddenne&s;s of the &s;urprize, that I can &s;carce command my&s;elf enough to proceed with the peru&s;al of it. It &s;eems to have been my brother's purpo&s;e that I &s;hou'd be made ac|quainted with the contents, yet no &s;uch com|munication was ever made to me, &s;o that in honour I am hardly &s;atisfied that I ought to read any further. Have you, Doctor Sand|ford, any knowledge of this paper? You was mo&s;t in the confidence of Sir Stephen: if you have any information on the &s;ubject, give it me; if not, advi&s;e me what to do."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have nothing to guide me but conjec|ture,"</Q> replied the Doctor; <Q REND="inline">"but I &s;hou'd pre|&s;ume there need be no he&s;itation on your part to read what profe&s;&s;es to have been written for your information. The early attachment of our dear lamented lady is well known to every friend of the family; and I &s;hou'd gue&s;s the paper may refer to that: there has ever been a my&s;tery con&s;equential of that tran&s;ac|tion; and as it is probably develop'd in that po&s;thumous packet, I will with your permi&s;|&s;ion retire, whil&s;t you examine it in private."</Q> <PB N="67" REF="71">
So &s;aying, he left the room, and Sir Roger read as follows:&mdash;</P>
<Q>Particulars relative to my daughter Cecilia, to be communicated to her uncle, Sir Roger Man&s;tock, after my decea&s;e.
<P>Upon the 14th day of Augu&s;t, 1761, my daughter, then of the age of &s;ixteen and upwards, &s;ecretly e&s;caped from Hagley-hou&s;e, in company with a young cornet, the honourable Henry Delapoer, purpo&s;ing to effect a &s;tolen marriage at Gretna Green.</P>
<P>The young man, I confe&s;s, had made fair and open propo&s;als for my daughter; but I had other views, and po&s;itively pro|hibited the connection. He was formed to engage a heart like Cecilia's; his per&s;on was fine, his manners and addre&s;s were capti|vating in the extreme. Alas! mi&s;taken man that I am, I knew not to what extremes her pa&s;&s;ion was capable of hurrying her, and fooli&s;hly expected that my authority could extingui&s;h it. Love and nature &s;et my power at nought, and my child, (in every other in&s;tance of her life the mo&s;t dutiful creature breathing) broke tho&s;e from every
<PB N="68" REF="72">
filial tie, and elop'd with her admirer. Furious in my wrath, and equally exa&s;|perated again&s;t both parties, I pur&s;ued them along the road with &s;uch unremitted exer|tion, that upon their very la&s;t po&s;t I over|took and &s;urpriz'd them in a public inn, where they were changing hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Here I forc'd them (Oh! fatal violence!) from each other's arms, in &s;pite of prayers, entreaties, and even confe&s;&s;ion, on Cecilia's part, of an anticipated con&s;ummation, that took from innocence its virgin glo&s;s, and, in the cour&s;e of time, to the di&s;honour of my hou&s;e and the ruin of my mind's fu|ture peace, occa&s;ion'd my poor child to be an unmarried mother, whil&s;t her di&s;con&s;o|late lover had left his native country, and em|barked for the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>Early in the month of May en&s;uing, Ce|cilia was &s;ecretly deliver'd in my own hou&s;e of a male infant. Zachary Cawdle, a faithful man, and &s;kilful in his profe&s;&s;ion, a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in that painful extremity.&mdash;Hea|ven and earth! can I de&s;cribe my angui&s;h, my remor&s;e, my terrors, in tho&s;e mo|ments! What would I then have given could I have recalled the bani&s;hed father of my wretched grand&s;on! How did my con|&s;cience
<PB N="69" REF="73">
rack me with remor&s;e for having torn two hearts a&s;under, pledged to each other by every &s;acred vow, and virtually though not legally married! Oh! had I then had mercy in my wrath, had I allowed for nature, for affection, for the weakne&s;s of a fond doating girl at &s;ixteen years of age, what mi&s;ery had I prevented! what &s;hame had I avoided! Let no father henceforth tread in my unwary &s;teps&mdash;they will but lead him to remor&s;e and agony.</P>
<P>And now ten years are pa&s;t, whil&s;t I have &s;een my daughter married to a de&s;picable lord, who is her tyrant rather than her hu&s;|band. In her my generation legitimately &s;tops; no fruit can &s;pring from &s;uch a &s;tock; her bed is barren, and her heart is broken. Thank Heaven, my grand&s;on Henry &s;till &s;urvives; protected, reared and educated by the be&s;t of men, and of friends the mo&s;t faithful, I &s;ee him fo&s;tered into early virtues by the forming hand of Rat|cliffe. God of all mercies, ble&s;s and pro&s;per the my&s;terious i&s;&s;ue of my haple&s;s child! Whil&s;t my &s;ad daughter lives and is Lord Crowbery's wife, I dare not venture to avow the &s;on of indi&s;cretion. Hard fate
<PB N="70" REF="74">
for him, poor innocent, for my Cecilia, for my&s;elf!</P>
<P>Is there a friend now left to me on earth, in who&s;e humane and hone&s;t heart I can repo&s;e my &s;orrows and my &s;ecret? Let me &s;till hope there is; &s;urely Sir Roger Man|&s;tock is that candid, that tru&s;t-worthy friend.</P>
<P>To Sir Roger Man&s;tock, to the uncle of my child, in confidence I bequeath this mournful narrative of my errors and mi&s;|fortunes, imploring him, by all that he holds &s;acred, to protect and father the la&s;t relict of my hou&s;e, my namele&s;s unacknow|ledged child, to whom I tru&s;t a mother's love and ju&s;tice will bequeath that property, which in this firm per&s;ua&s;ion I Have devi&s;ed to her, and put into her free and ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al, without limitation or re&s;traint. Let Henry then take his father's name; I would not leave a &s;tigma on my daugh|ter's memory. May Crowbery never have to &s;ay he took the refu&s;e of a favour'd lover!</P>

you therefore, Sir, my brother and my friend, I addre&s;s this paper, avowing a full &s;en&s;e of my pa&s;t errors, and a deep con|trition for that haughty &s;pirit of revenge, which prompted me to bla&s;t the happine&s;s of two per&s;ons formed for each other, wedded in &s;pirit and in heart; and who, but for my fatal interference, would have ble&s;t the rem|nant of my days. To you, Sir, my brother and my friend, I once more &s;olemnly be|queath my grand&s;on Henry: you are your|&s;elf a father; you have a lovely daughter two years younger than my boy; nature has taught you how to judge of my &s;en&s;a|tions by your own. To your family my fortune would have devolved had not this &s;on of my Cecilia &s;tood between us: may I not form a di&s;tant hope that time and education may hereafter &s;o adorn and grace the work of nature, as to make him worthy your regard and love? The out&s;et is au&s;pi|cious; the promi&s;e of his infant years is flattering in the extreme. Should this fair blo&s;&s;om ripen into that perfection, which its early bloom gives hope of, and &s;hould your &s;weet child, my pretty god-daughter, when time with lenient hand has moulded her &s;oft

May Heaven in&s;pire your heart with &s;entiments more generous! and may he, who mixes blood from no ignoble &s;ource with that which he derives from me, merit a ble&s;&s;ing great as my fond fancy has devi&s;ed.

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX. The Coun&s;el of a Friend in a Dilemma. More Secrets are brought to Light.</HEAD>
<P>THE peru&s;al of this paper, which pointed out to Sir Roger Man&s;tock the &s;on of his niece, in the per&s;on of Henry, the admirer of his daughter, threw him into deep medita|tion, and exceedingly perplexed him how to act in a ca&s;e, where deci&s;ion on either &s;ide mi|litated again&s;t his feelings. The appeal was &s;olemn, that pleaded in favour of the youth,
<PB N="73" REF="77">
the objection to his illegitimacy, and even to his proximity of blood, was no &s;light one, and Sir Roger's mind was long time balanced be|tween difficulties. One point his con&s;cience &s;aw in the cleare&s;t light&mdash;the equity of Henry's claim to the property of his grandfather; and, accord|ing to the high &s;en&s;e of honour natural to him, he interpreted the paper he had ju&s;t been reading: but how to act with re&s;pect to his daughter, whether to oppo&s;e or to countenance her at|tachment, was the que&s;tion that embarra&s;&s;ed him. On the oppo&s;ing &s;ide, there was a &s;trong repugnance, ari&s;ing from his habits of thinking, and from a certain pride of family, which re|volted from the &s;tain of illegitimacy; on the favourable &s;ide, there was much occurred to mitigate the rigour of the&s;e thoughts. The character of Henry pre-eminently pleaded in his behalf; the fatal con&s;equences of paternal obduracy, &s;o forcibly &s;et forth in the recital of Sir Stephen, was a &s;triking example before his eyes; and the pathetic adjuration, at the clo&s;e of that recital, was an affecting appeal to his heart, which was &s;en&s;ibly felt.</P>
<P>'Tis in a cri&s;is like this, when the mind is fluctuating between doubt and deci&s;ion, that the voice of a friend is mo&s;t welcome, and
<PB N="74" REF="78">
then it is that new rea&s;ons, or rea&s;ons dif|ferently expre&s;&s;ed and dilated, &s;eldom fail to cut the knot that puzzles us to unravel. Sir Roger rung his bell, and reque&s;ted the com|pany of Doctor Sandford.</P>
<P>A better arbitrator could not be cho&s;en; he read the paper attentively, and when called upon for his &s;entiments upon it, deliberately replied as follows: <Q REND="inline">"I am not &s;urpris'd at the di&s;covery, which this paper gives; for though I was not a party to the &s;ecret of this young man's birth, I was ever in my private opinion per&s;uaded of his being the &s;on of tho&s;e very parents now di&s;clos'd to us. Well may the unhappy writer bewail his own obduracy; I knew the party rejected, and thought him every way de&s;erving of the alliance he courted; Sir Stephen knew my &s;entiments, for he drew them from me, and I hone&s;tly committed my opinion to his con&s;ideration; it did not tally with his own, and I lo&s;t his confidence by the &s;incerity with which I gave it. Mr. Ratcliffe, in con&s;equence of this, had charge of the in|fant&mdash;a better choice cou'd not be made, a worthier, wi&s;er, more enlighten'd mind no man po&s;&s;e&s;t&mdash;to an education &s;o excellent, the &s;on of your niece did ample ju&s;tice. Nature
<PB N="75" REF="79">
never form'd a more engaging per&s;on, in|&s;truction never cultivated a more accompli&s;h'd mind."</Q></P>
<P>Here Sir Roger interpo&s;ed, declaring his entire concurrence in this te&s;timony to his merits&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But with what face,"</Q> he demanded, <Q REND="inline">"can I hold up to the world the &s;purious i&s;&s;ue of my deluded niece? What will Lord Crow|bery &s;ay? What will the world at large &s;ay to an adoption like this? I &s;hou'd be glad to hear your &s;entiments on this point of difficulty."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With this paper in my hand,"</Q> replied the Doctor, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot re&s;i&s;t the appeal it con|tains, nor refu&s;e being advocate for the feel|ings of the writer of it. When I &s;ee a father taking on him&s;elf the reproach of being &s;ole author of his daughter's errors and misfor|tunes, and weigh the circum&s;tances that at|tended their elopement and arre&s;t upon the way, I can hardly be induced to call their i&s;&s;ue illegitimate. I &s;hou'd go too far, if I was to deny the right of a parent to re&s;train, or to direct, the pa&s;&s;ions of his child; but Sir Stephen went farther, and exerted more authority than belong'd to him, when he compell'd a mar|riage with the Lord Vi&s;count Crowbery; that is an act of tyranny over the human heart,
<PB N="76" REF="80">
which I hold in abhorrence. What vows were interchang'd between your niece and her fir&s;t lover we cannot know, but we can well conjecture they were &s;olemn and &s;incere on both &s;ides. Their hearts were married, tho' the <HI>black&s;mith</HI> was not found that wou'd have clinch'd the chain. Shall then the &s;on of love and promi&s;e be di&s;claim'd, becau&s;e a few hours interven'd, and force was employ'd to tear their hands a&s;under, and compel them to a &s;eparation? Mark how the parent &s;uffers in his con&s;cience for this act of cruelty! So wou'd not I for all this world can give me. Henry is a virtuous youth: affix what criminality you plea&s;e to the authors of his birth, we cannot &s;o pervert all &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, as to attach their &s;tain to his character, however much we may wi&s;h to cover the memory of his mother from the malevolent attacks of Lord Crowbery and others, who may be ba&s;ely di&s;pos'd to bla&s;t it. This, I confe&s;s, &s;hou'd be avoided as much as po&s;&s;ible; and &s;urely it will be no impo&s;&s;ible thing to do that by proper precautions, with re&s;pect to Lord Crowbery at lea&s;t, &s;o long as he &s;urvives, which &s;eems to have been the clear intention of the deceas'd lady, when &s;he forebore to name her &s;on in her will; and
<PB N="77" REF="81">
as you have told me Henry him&s;elf was the chief promoter of this omi&s;&s;ion, I cannot doubt but he was fully acknowledg'd by his mother before &s;he died."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't doubt that,"</Q> re&s;umed Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"and I hold my daughter bound to re&s;tore him to his inheritance upon every principle of honour and ju&s;tice; but I am not bound to give him my daughter al&s;o."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Far be it from me,"</Q> re|plied the Doctor, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;ay that; your daugh|ter's inclination mu&s;t precede a &s;tep &s;o e&s;&s;ential to her own happine&s;s as that."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But am I bound to follow, with my con&s;ent, her inclina|tions, if they &s;hou'd point to him?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t decline an an&s;wer to that que&s;tion, being &s;o partial as I am to Henry."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why that is an&s;wering it,"</Q> replied Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"to the fulle&s;t extent."</Q> Here their conference was interrupted by a &s;ervant, who announced a gentleman of the name of Smith, that reque&s;ted a few minutes conver&s;ation in private with Sir Roger Man&s;tock. Order being given for the gentleman's admittance, and Doctor Sandford having withdrawn, the father of our hero pre|&s;ented him&s;elf to the worthy Baronet, and ad|dre&s;&s;ed him to the following effect:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am per&s;onally unknown to you, Sir Roger Man&s;tock, but am no &s;tranger to your
<PB N="78" REF="82">
character, and hold it in the mo&s;t perfect re|&s;pect: I have therefore &s;olicited a few minutes of your lei&s;ure, and you have politely granted it, for which I thank you, and will &s;tudy not to abu&s;e your patience. I have &s;ent in a name by your &s;ervant, which, in your pre&s;ence, I &s;hou'd be a&s;ham'd to wear, being only an a&s;|&s;um'd one, for rea&s;ons that, I tru&s;t, you will think not unworthy of a gentleman. My real name is Henry Delapoer, which, in times pa&s;t, you may have heard attach'd to that of the lovelie&s;t, and by me the mo&s;t lamented, of her &s;ex; pardon me, if for the pre&s;ent I can pro|ceed no further."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Roger &s;tarted with amaze; he &s;mote his hands together with more than u&s;ual energy, and gazed upon the &s;tranger with inten&s;e cu|rio&s;ity&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"May I believe what I hear!"</Q> he cried; <Q REND="inline">"Are you really Mr. Delapoer, the ho|nourable Henry Delapoer, father&mdash;"</Q> There he &s;topt &s;hort, and checked the words that were upon his lips.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> interjected the vi&s;itor, <Q REND="inline">"you was proceeding with your &s;peech; may I reque&s;t you to fill up the &s;entence?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You may,"</Q> replied Sir Roger, after a &s;hort pau&s;e; <Q REND="inline">"the words I was about to add were, the father of my niece's &s;on."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My
<PB N="79" REF="83">
con&s;cience then is clear,"</Q> &s;aid Delapoer; <Q REND="inline">"you are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the &s;ecret, and I have broke no tru&s;t. Yes, Sir, I am that very per&s;on; mi&s;erable in the recollection of the bittere&s;t dis|appointment that ever bla&s;ted human happi|ne&s;s, but honour'd in the virtues of that &s;on, who is at once the memorial of our misfortune and the relict of our love. I may now &s;ay to Sir Roger Man&s;tock all that a wounded heart &s;ugge&s;ts; I may &s;peak of my &s;orrows, of my affection, of my de&s;pair, which is now hurry|ing me to the grave, where my betroth'd, my ever-lov'd Cecilia &s;leeps."</Q> Here a gu&s;t of tears interrupted his &s;peech for a few in&s;tants; he wiped them away, and proceeded&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It is now my reque&s;t, and I hope your charity will grant it, that my remains may be allow'd to re&s;t in the vault be&s;ide tho&s;e of that &s;ainted being, who was by every obligation &s;acred in the eye of Heaven my true and all but legal wife. Sir, we were bound together by the holie&s;t ties. Accur&s;ed be the breath that dares to contaminate the purity of my Cecilia's fame! If there was crime in our precipitancy, that crime be on my head, I will embrace the whole of the offence; let her unfeeling father take on him&s;elf the re&s;pon&s;ibility of our &s;epa|ration!
<PB N="80" REF="84">
Sir, I have held it matter of the &s;tricte&s;t con&s;cience, ever &s;ince that fatal moment, to keep unviolated the marriage bed, and I have religiou&s;ly fulfill'd that &s;acred duty. One melancholy con&s;olation Heaven vouch&s;af'd; Providence employ'd the arm of my &s;on to re&s;cue me from death, when I was a pri&s;oner on board a &s;hip of the enemy, and at the la&s;t &s;tage of exi&s;tence; he brought me to the port of Falmouth; his piety and care pre&s;erv'd my life; fortune directed Cecilia to the &s;ame &s;pot; I pa&s;s'd &s;ome days by the couch of that dying martyr, and &s;he expir'd in the arms of me and of my &s;on. Grant me then, I be&s;eech you, my la&s;t earne&s;t prayer, and let my corp&s;e re|po&s;e by her's."</Q></P>
<P>The Baronet, who&s;e long &s;ilence had been the effect of his &s;ympathy in the feelings of the &s;peaker, now found him&s;elf called upon for a reply at a time, when he was much more in|clined to give a loo&s;e to tears than to words. He commanded him&s;elf notwith&s;tanding &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ure his vi&s;itor, that his &s;uit was granted, and to add withal, that he hoped it would be many years before that promi&s;e could be claimed. To this Delapoer replied, with many acknowledgments, that nothing but
<PB N="81" REF="85">
his conviction that no time was to be lo&s;t could have excu&s;ed to him&s;elf the rude in|tru&s;ion of &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable a vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Here he pau&s;ed, and &s;eemed preparing to take his leave, when it occurred to Sir Roger as proper to appri&s;e him, that he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf by chance of a po&s;thumous paper, written by his niece's father, which had thrown great light on his &s;tate of mind, and which at the &s;ame time devolved a duty upon him, on the part of his daughter, of rein&s;tating Henry in the whole of his grandfather's e&s;tate. <Q REND="inline">"This,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"is an act of ju&s;tice which I think I can take upon my&s;elf to &s;ay will be infallibly perform'd on our part; and I &s;hall now put the paper into your hands for your peru&s;al, and very highly intere&s;ting it is to you, Mr. De|lapoer, and your repre&s;entative."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X. Our Hi&s;tory records a dreadful Incident.</HEAD>
<P>DELAPOER having read the paper, re|turned it to Sir Roger, ob&s;erving, that although the writer's change of &s;entiments
<PB N="82" REF="86">
came too late for redre&s;s, it was to be hoped they were in time for the full purpo&s;es of repentance. He then proceeded to di&s;clo&s;e to Sir Roger the &s;tate of his own circum&s;tances in point of fortune, which, being &s;ettled upon Henry, would at all events make him an af|fluent man. <Q REND="inline">"There is but one object in life,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"can make him a happy one. If I know his thoughts rightly, it is the per&s;on, not the property, of the pre&s;ent heire&s;s of this e&s;tate, which he would receive as the greate&s;t bounty &s;he cou'd be&s;tow upon him."</Q></P>
<P>To this Sir Roger &s;imply replied, that Henry was certainly a very amiable young man; and Delapoer, too delicate to pre&s;s his wi&s;hes any further, politely took his leave and departed. In fact, the mind of the worthy Baronet was by no means made up to any de|termin'd mea&s;ure, and as the recent death of Lady Crowbery &s;ecur'd him from any pre&s;ent call from either of the parties, he very gladly availed him&s;elf of the excu&s;e for holding back his opinion, till it was more matured by ex|perience and reflection.</P>
<P>Henry now wi&s;hed to throw a&s;ide a ma&s;k he was no longer compelled to wear, and to declare him&s;elf to Sir Roger Man&s;tock; but
<PB N="83" REF="87">
as it was nece&s;&s;ary, in the fir&s;t place, to con&s;ult I&s;abella's opinion in the ca&s;e, he followed her into the park, where he under&s;tood &s;he was gone to take her evening walk. When he had mounted the hill that ro&s;e from the hou&s;e, he caught a di&s;tant glimp&s;e of her, as &s;he was entering a grove of oaks, and immediately &s;et out towards the &s;pot with all the &s;peed he could. He was yet at &s;ome di&s;tance, when a female &s;hriek was heard as coming from &s;ome one in the grove, which &s;truck him to the heart with the apprehen&s;ion that his lovely I&s;abella was in danger or alarm. Already nearly breathle&s;s with his exertions, terror gave him all but wings upon a call &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, and he &s;prung forwards towards the voice with an impetuo&s;ity unde&s;cribable.</P>
<P>Swift as his motion was, our hi&s;tory de|mands a pau&s;e before we bring him to the re&s;cue of the affrighted I&s;abella, whil&s;t we ac|count for the cau&s;e of that &s;hriek &s;o terrible to the ears of love.</P>
<P>In the near neighbourhood of Hagley Hou&s;e, without the enclo&s;ure of the park, there was a lonely man&s;ion, tenanted by a per&s;on who&s;e melancholy profe&s;&s;ion it was to take charge of tho&s;e unhappy beings, who are deprived of
<PB N="84" REF="88">
rea&s;on. One of the&s;e di&s;tracted objects, and probably the mo&s;t pitiable in the whole wretched fraternity, was a young man of the name of Saunders, only &s;on of a re&s;pectable clergyman, who had bred him in the line of his own profe&s;&s;ion, and given him an excellent education with that view, both at &s;chool and univer&s;ity. The youth, whom nature had en|dowed with uncommon talents, had more than equalled all the warme&s;t expectations of a fond exulting father. Every honour that moral conduct could merit, every prize that &s;ucce&s;s|ful genius could contend for, had been fairly gained, and worthily po&s;&s;e&s;t, by this young &s;tudent; but &s;trong imagination and a feeling heart, the natural concomitants of &s;uperior genius, had con&s;pired again&s;t the peace of poor Saunders, and by a di&s;appointment in love, had made wreck of a mind full freighted with &s;cience, and richly endowed with every noble quality. The object of his pa&s;&s;ion was unfor|tunately one, to whom, in point of rank and circum&s;tances, he could not a&s;pire; and though &s;he felt his merits, and was flattered by his at|tentions, yet his &s;uit was peremptorily and proudly rejected by her father, who had higher views, and over-ruled the affections of his
<PB N="85" REF="89">
child with ab&s;olute authority. The &s;ame fine ta&s;te that taught him to &s;elect and admire the pure&s;t models of cla&s;&s;ical compo&s;ition, in&s;pired him with a pa&s;&s;ion for the elegant and beauti|ful Loui&s;a Beaufort: his opportunities of con|ver&s;ing with her were not frequent; for Sir Ferdinand her father was not ea&s;y of acce&s;s from one &s;o much his inferior, and Saunders was reduced to a variety of humble &s;hifts to make known to Loui&s;a the flame that was con&s;uming him, and gradually undermining the foundations of a &s;olid under&s;tanding. The &s;mile, which at &s;ome &s;tolen moment &s;he could be&s;tow upon him, was his only hope; on the&s;e reflections he fed, and, by the help of a vivid fancy, &s;ketched out dreams and vi&s;ions of hap|pine&s;s, which in one fatal moment were for ever bla&s;ted, by the intelligence of her being married to a titled lover. From this in&s;tant his deportment became irregular and capri|cious: at fir&s;t he was loud and vehement in his complaints; he talked of the affair to all his friends, profe&s;&s;ed to treat it with contempt, and railed again&s;t the &s;ex in general, venting upon them all the invectives, which his me|mory or imagination could &s;ugge&s;t: he ran&s;acked the poets ancient and modern for
<PB N="86" REF="90">
epigrams and lampoons, and had by heart every tag and fragment of &s;atire, which made for his purpo&s;e, and which Greek, Latin, or Eng|li&s;h could &s;upply. If any one of his acquain|tance &s;poke in prai&s;e of a woman, or even toa&s;ted the health of his mi&s;tre&s;s, he was ready with a da&s;h at his folly, which oftentimes would have brought on &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, had he not been very generally con&s;idered as a licen&s;ed railer, or had his companions been as prompt for quarrel as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This humour being &s;pent, his mind took a &s;udden turn to the contrary extreme, and poor Saunders was no more to be found in &s;ociety; &s;ullen and inacce&s;&s;ible, he &s;hut him&s;elf into his college room, and centering all his ideas, heretofore &s;o wild and excur&s;ive, in one &s;ingle point, and dwelling invariably upon that with pertinacious melancholy, the vigour of his in|tellect began to melt away, whil&s;t his con&s;ti|tution, partaking of the &s;ame debility, and at|tenuated by long fa&s;ting, was ha&s;tening to de|cay by actual inanition. A &s;tudent, late &s;o regular in his duties, could not ab&s;ent him&s;elf from college hours without drawing the at|tention of his tutor and other members of the &s;ociety upon him; the former of the&s;e one day
<PB N="87" REF="91">
took means of &s;urpri&s;ing him in his room, where he di&s;covered him on his knees, em|ployed in loud and fervent prayer, to which his pre&s;ence gave not the &s;malle&s;t interrup|tion, whil&s;t the poor &s;upplicant continued to deplore his wretched &s;tate of mind in terms truly piteous and di&s;con&s;olate, intermixt with petitions mo&s;t earne&s;t and devout for the pre|&s;ervation of his rea&s;on. His pitying vi&s;itor was melted at the &s;cene of &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, and having waited for a proper interval, applied &s;uch con&s;olation as his charity could &s;ugge&s;t upon the emergency, and in&s;tantly di&s;patched a letter to the father, appri&s;ing him of the dangerous condition to which his pupil was reduced. This &s;ad intelligence &s;oon brought the afflicted parent to be a witne&s;s of the total ruin of his hopes; he took the poor di&s;tracted creature with him to his own hou&s;e, where, find|ing no relief to his di&s;order, but, on the contrary, an encrea&s;e of every &s;ymptom to an extrava|gance, that kept him under hourly alarm, he at la&s;t re&s;olved to re&s;ign him wholly into the hands of a keeper, and in this hou&s;e, before de&s;cribed, he placed him, where, for &s;ome months, he had been confined under proper regimen, though without any progre&s;s towards <PB N="88" REF="92">
cure, of which his wretched parent now began to lo&s;e all hope.</P>
<P>It had &s;o chanced this very evening, that with a cunning peculiar to his di&s;temper, he had contrived to elope from his keeper, and running out of the hou&s;e at random, had made his way into Hagley Park, e&s;caping the &s;ight of his pur&s;uers by hiding him&s;elf in the grove, where he was lying buried under the thicke&s;t of the underwood, when chance brought the beauteous I&s;abella, in her &s;olitary ramble, to the very &s;pot where he was concealed. A glimp&s;e of her fair form, which his quick eye caught through the bu&s;hes, rou&s;ed him in&s;tantly from his lair, and &s;pringing on her like a couchant tyger on the unwary pa&s;&s;enger, he &s;ei&s;ed the trembling victim in his arms, roaring out in a yell of tran&s;port&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Have I caught you then at la&s;t, vile perjur'd woman! traitre&s;s to my love! murderer of my peace! fal&s;e, faithle&s;s Loui&s;a, you have driven me to de&s;peration; you have made me what I am, mad as the fires of Hecla, wild as the waves that &s;wal|low navigation up; and now, &s;yren, I'll be reveng'd upon you for my transformation; a bea&s;t of your own creation &s;hall devour you; I'll pluck a&s;under tho&s;e fine limbs, and &s;catter

them to all the points of heaven. Come, come, no &s;truggling; hence with all this frip|pery! away with it! you are but Nature's counterfeit; we'll have her full in &s;ight, and then&mdash;."</Q></P>
<P>Upon the in&s;tant, in that &s;aving momentary cri&s;is on which humanity will not admit of &s;pe|culation's pau&s;e, our hero Henry, breathle&s;s, agha&s;t, led thither by that un&s;een clue, which Providence had graciou&s;ly be&s;towed for vir|tue's timely re&s;cue, &s;prung upon the lunatic, and with a phren&s;y equal to his own, gra&s;ping him in his arms, hurled him violently to the ground, never quitting his hold, but accom|panying him in his fall: in the &s;ame moment, the di&s;hevelled I&s;abella, her cloak, handker|chief, and clothes torn from her, dropt ina|nimate at his &s;ide, without uttering even a &s;igh that &s;hewed &s;igns of life. Di&s;tracted with the &s;ight, &s;till he did not venture to let loo&s;e his de&s;perate antagoni&s;t, who raved and foamed in all the furious exce&s;s of phren&s;y, yelling and gna&s;hing with his teeth, a &s;pectacle too horrible for contemplation. Emaciated as he was, the very &s;pectre of famine, &s;till his mad|ne&s;s gave him nerves almo&s;t &s;upernatural, and in their grappling all the vigour Henry's ac|tive
<PB N="90" REF="94">
limbs could furni&s;h, &s;ometimes &s;carce &s;uf|ficed to keep him under, and hold him down extended on his back; at length the wretched creature gave one de&s;perate &s;truggle, then uttered a direful groan, and &s;wooned upon the &s;pot, &s;tretching his limbs as if in the la&s;t pang of life.</P>
<P>Happily at this moment the keeper and his follower, guided to the &s;pot by the yells and howlings of their patient, made their ap|pearance, to the un&s;peakable relief of our ex|hau&s;ted hero, who&s;e terrors for the beloved object, lying breathle&s;s by his &s;ide, were now become too agonizing to endure. In&s;tantly he rai&s;ed her in his arms, replaced the &s;catter|ed fragments of her dre&s;s with tendere&s;t at|tention, arranging it in a manner as decorous as her &s;ituation and his own di&s;traction would admit, and calling out to the keeper for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in recovering her from her &s;woon. The man had &s;kill, and was not wanting in humanity; he knew withal the quality of the lady who &s;tood in need of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and was terrified, not le&s;s on his own account than on her's, for the con&s;equences of what had happened: bidding his &s;ervant take charge of the lunatic, by tying up his hands, he applied
<PB N="91" REF="95">
him&s;elf directly to the recovery of the lady, and drawing out a ca&s;e of lancets, recom|mended the immediate opening of a vein; this was eagerly acceded to by Henry, and in a few &s;econds the pure blood that fed the veins of the faire&s;t form in nature &s;prung forth from the lancet, and at the &s;ame time the brighte&s;t eyes that ever lover looked upon, unveiled their lids, and fixt their &s;ight on Henry, who, whil&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ting the operation ju&s;t performed, had received upon his per&s;on the full gu&s;hing tribute of that &s;anguine &s;tream &s;o much dearer to him than what fed his own fond heart. The &s;ight of this, to which in his confu&s;ion he had not adverted, &s;o terrified the reviving I&s;abella, that the fir&s;t &s;ign &s;he gave of recollection was a &s;cream of terror on the di&s;covery, crying out to the operator&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Leave, leave me, and &s;taunch his wounds; he is bleeding to death, and do not think I will &s;urvive him."</Q></P>
<P>Joy &s;ei&s;ed the heart of Henry to hear the voice of his beloved I&s;abella, and to hear it fir&s;t employed in anxious concern for him; he eagerly a&s;&s;ured her he was not wounded; that the blood which alarmed her was her own:
<PB N="92" REF="96">
and upon the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, the &s;tream that had &s;topped began to flow again, and her &s;en&s;es grew clear by the revul&s;ion. When her arm was bound up, and her mind became com|po&s;ed, her attention was attracted by the di&s;|order of her dre&s;s; &s;urveying the confu&s;ion and derangement which her per&s;on had un|dergone, &s;he perceived that certain articles had been replaced by hands not practi&s;ed in tho&s;e offices, and the &s;en&s;ation covered her with blu&s;hes: the emotion was not lo&s;t upon Henry; he could interpret what was pa&s;&s;ing in her thoughts, and took occa&s;ion, with a de|licacy peculiar to him&s;elf, to allay and &s;oothe her inquietude. She turned a look upon him that beggars all de&s;cription; love beamed in her eyes, gratitude filled them with tears; then having caught a glimp&s;e of Saunders, as he was under cu&s;tody of his keeper, turned away with &s;huddering from the &s;ight, and fell upon Henry's neck, crying out&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh my Henry! my pre&s;erver! from what horrors have you re&s;cued me!"</Q>&mdash;Let tho&s;e that have the powers of de&s;cription paint his tran&s;ports if they can; I &s;ink beneath the ta&s;k, and re|commend it to the reader's fancy, if ever he
<PB N="93" REF="97">
experienced joy like this; if not, I wi&s;h he may de&s;erve it, and obtain it.</P>
<P>The wretched object that had occa&s;ioned all this terror now engaged their attention; he had recovered from his &s;woon, but &s;o wan and woe-begone as would have extracted pity from a heart of a &s;tone; he was &s;itting on the ground, his hands confined with a bandage &s;wathed round his wri&s;ts; he rolled his eyes about in wild di&s;order, and at la&s;t fixing them on his keeper, drooped his head, gave a deep &s;igh, and bur&s;t into tears. He was now at once become as meek and humble as he had been outrageous, and rea&s;on &s;eemed to have revi&s;ited his mind with the return of tempe|rance.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am a very wretched creature,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"and &s;en&s;ible of my misfortunes, that &s;ometimes drive me into extravagancies I never fail to repent of: I know it is for my good that this worthy gentleman ties up my hands; but if he wou'd have the charity to &s;et me at liberty, I wou'd convince him that I am not unfit to be tru&s;ted with the u&s;e of them; if he will not grant me this favour, I &s;hou'd be much beholden to him, wou'd he have the kindne&s;s to remove a few paces out

<P>Here the keeper turned a look upon him, which he quickly under&s;tood as a &s;ign for &s;ilence, and obeyed: a look no le&s;s intelligent was pa&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame moment in another quarter, for Henry, fixing his eyes upon the keeper's follower, recognized the per&s;on of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in O'Rourke, and perceiving certain indications in the fellow's countenance, which convinced him he was right, he &s;aid to him in a whi&s;per&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Don't be alarm'd, O'Rourke, for I &s;hall not betray you: if you execute this melancholy office faithfully and humanely, you are in a way to atone to &s;ociety for the crime you have committed."</Q></P>

<P>POOR Saunders being now removed, and the operation of the bleeding having &s;uc|ceeded in re&s;toring I&s;abella to the full po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of her &s;en&s;es, and in &s;ome degree of her &s;trength, &s;he declared her&s;elf able to walk to the hou&s;e, and forbade the propo&s;al of &s;end|ing for a carriage, as it would create an alarm which could hardly fail of finding its way to her father. With her natural grace and good humour &s;he accepted the apologies of the keeper of the lunatics, Gordon by name, who was very anxious to exculpate him&s;elf to the heire&s;s of Hagley, and to tender his further &s;ervices, if occa&s;ion required. In accounting for the e&s;cape of his patient, through the ne|gligence of his &s;ervant, he took occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve by the way, that a derangement of the rea&s;on, proceeding from di&s;appointed love, was univer&s;ally experienced to be the very wor&s;t &s;pecies of madne&s;s that human nature was &s;ub|ject

to; this, he &s;aid, was unhappily the ca&s;e of Mr. Saunders, whom he de&s;paired of as per|fectly incurable.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> cried Henry, <Q REND="inline">"I pity him from my &s;oul: I dare &s;ay his &s;tory is a melancholy one, but we will not trouble you to relate it."</Q>&mdash;This he &s;aid as a hint to Gordon, that any farther di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ubject, in I&s;abella's hearing, &s;hould be avoided; and it might be in part from the &s;ame motive that &s;he declined his offer to attend upon her home, relying &s;ole|ly on the arm of her protector for her &s;upport by the way, and leaving Gordon to re&s;ume his melancholy vocation in the man&s;ion of mi&s;ery, on the &s;kirts of the common, adjoining to the park.</P>
<P>Henry now, for the fir&s;t time in his life, re|gretted the length of way he had to mea&s;ure with his lovely but languid charge, and pro|ceeded &s;lowly and cautiou&s;ly, regardful of every motion that might di&s;turb her, and di|recting every &s;tep for her &s;ecurity and ea&s;e. With hearts full of gratitude to Providence, and glowing with the tendere&s;t affection for each other, they walked &s;ilently on till they reached the boundary of the grove, where they came in view of the hou&s;e, upon an open
<PB N="97" REF="101">
lawn, that &s;loped with a gradual de&s;cent for the re&s;t of their way. Here they were de|&s;cried by Sir Roger and Doctor Sandford, as they were walking and conver&s;ing together within a few paces of the hou&s;e: the Baronet ob&s;erving that I&s;abella walked &s;lowly, and &s;eemed &s;upported by Henry, on who&s;e arm &s;he was leaning, in&s;tantly took alarm, and call|ing out to the &s;ervants, who happened then to be out of the way, was heard by young Sandford, who, bolting out of the hall-door, flew to the call.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Run, I be&s;eech you,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Roger, pointing to the &s;pot, <Q REND="inline">"run to I&s;a|bella yonder, and tell me what has happen'd, for I greatly fear &s;ome accident has befallen, or &s;ome illne&s;s &s;eiz'd her!"</Q>&mdash;Whil&s;t the&s;e words were on his lips, the eager me&s;&s;enger caught &s;ight of the object they referred to, and, &s;eized with the like terror, &s;prung forwards with his utmo&s;t &s;peed, whil&s;t Sir Roger, trembling with apprehen&s;ion, caught hold of his friend hy the arm, and &s;tood motionle&s;s on the &s;pot, in dreadful expectation of the event. In the &s;ame moment, whil&s;t Sandford was &s;training every nerve again&s;t the hill, I&s;abella, taken &s;uddenly with a giddine&s;s and lo&s;s of &s;ight, had come to a &s;top, and unable to keep her

feet, had fallen into Henry's arms, who, with one knee upon the ground, was &s;upporting her whole weight on his brea&s;t and &s;houlder, him|&s;elf pale as a&s;hes, and oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch agony of &s;oul, as to be almo&s;t in the very act of fainting, when Sandford came mo&s;t criti|cally to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The hou&s;e-&s;ervants mean time had &s;een what was going on, and taken the alarm; a pair of hor&s;es had fortu|nately been put to the chai&s;e, and were ready in the &s;table-yard; one of the &s;ervants had pre&s;ence of mind to order them to the &s;pot immediately, which was as in&s;tantly obeyed. During this operation, Sir Roger remained immoveable, a &s;pectacle of pity: Sandford &s;aw his di&s;tre&s;s, and as &s;oon as ever the chai&s;e and &s;ervants came to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of I&s;abella, ran back with all ha&s;te to Sir Roger, making &s;igns, and calling out by the way that he had good news, all was well, and no danger. Two &s;ervants had very con&s;iderately mounted behind the carriage, and by their help the faint and languid I&s;abella was lifted to the &s;eat, and placed upon it as much at her length as it admitted of: &s;he now opened her eyes, and ca&s;t them round in &s;earch for her pre&s;erver; he was &s;itting on the ground totally exhau&s;ted,

and in a &s;ituation, as it &s;eemed, more piteably helple&s;s than her own. She would not move without him, and he could not &s;tir without help towards her.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Lay me on the floor of the chai&s;e,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"and let me expire at her feet."</Q>&mdash;She heard his voice, but luckily the words did not reach her ear: at that in|&s;tant &s;he &s;tarted into life, and recovered as one out of a trance; the mi&s;t vani&s;hed from before her eyes, and &s;eeing Henry on the ground, &s;he conjured him to ari&s;e and come to her in the chai&s;e. Her father and Doctor Sandford now approached: Sir Roger's agi|tation, though much a&s;&s;uaged by what had been told him, was &s;till very great, and as he came up to the chai&s;e, the door of which was held open, &s;he cried out&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh! my beloved father, be in no alarm on my account; di&s;|mi&s;s your fears for me, and exert all your care for the recovery of my heroic pre&s;erver, to who&s;e courage, under Providence, I am in|debted for my life."</Q>&mdash;Henry was now on his legs, and re-animated with the &s;ound of her voice, &s;eemed to have lo&s;t his debility with the terror that had created it: as he pre|&s;ented him&s;elf to her &s;ight, I&s;abella exclaimed,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh! ble&s;&s;ed be Heaven, my protector

lives!"</Q>&mdash;Upon the&s;e words, Sir Roger turned a look upon him, in which that exce&s;s of gra|titude, which will not admit of language, was &s;o &s;trikingly depicted, that, as he threw his arms about our hero's neck, he &s;eemed to give him his whole heart with the embrace. His cheeks were wet with tears, he trembled and was faint; but nothing could per&s;uade him to avail him&s;elf of the chai&s;e; he pe|remptorily in&s;i&s;ted upon Henry's taking his &s;eat by I&s;abella&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Go, go,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"I will not rob you of the honour you have earn'd; with you the darling of my &s;oul is &s;afe; take the place you &s;o well merit, and let the &s;ame arm that &s;av'd my child, &s;upport her."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. De&s;cribes what our Heroine is, and what we wi&s;h our Virgin Readers to be.</HEAD>
<P>THE time is &s;o nearly approaching, when I mu&s;t clo&s;e this hi&s;tory, that I am now in the &s;ituation of a man, who, being on the point of parting from friends, in who&s;e com|pany he has taken a long and plea&s;ant tour, is anxious to call to mind any faults or omi&s;&s;ions he may have fallen into, that he may explain &s;uch as will bear a ju&s;tification, and a&s;k pardon for what demands an apology.</P>
<P>To enter on a review of all my errors, is a ta&s;k above my hands; but there is one, I ap|prehend, apparently too gro&s;s to be over|looked by any of my readers; I mean that of neglecting to de&s;cribe the per&s;on of my he|roine. If this is a crime, it is the more un|pardonable, fora&s;much as I cannot plead over|&s;ight
<PB N="102" REF="106">
and inadvertency in excu&s;e of it; I have kept her portrait wilfully in its ca&s;e, and not di&s;clo&s;ed even the colour of her eyes, or &s;et to view a &s;ingle locket of her hair. Fielding's Sophia had locks of glo&s;&s;y black, more mo|dern novels give their heroines flaxen tre&s;&s;es and azure eyes; there is a fa&s;hion in beauty; perhaps my I&s;abella had neither the jet of the raven, nor the ivory of the &s;wan: I would prefix to the&s;e volumes an engraving from her portrait, but Henry would not let it out of his hands; and our great arti&s;ts are &s;o fully em|ployed, that not one was at lei&s;ure to go down to Man&s;tock-hou&s;e to take the copy.</P>
<P>Now, as I have not the vanity to attempt an undertaking, which I believe no author has yet &s;ucceeded in, I will not aim to de&s;cribe what will not bear a de&s;cription: &s;ingularity or deformity may be delineated by the vehicle of words; perfect beauty eludes the power of language. Let it &s;uffice for me to &s;ay, upon the faith of an hi&s;torian, that my heroine was all the mo&s;t doating lover, when dreaming of his mi&s;tre&s;s, fancies her to be, and &s;omething more than the &s;elf-admiring beauty beholds, when &s;he examines her&s;elf in the gla&s;s. Yet in many things &s;he fell &s;hort of &s;ome, whom
<PB N="103" REF="107">
I have heard extolled above the mode&s;ty of prai&s;e: her eyes could not expre&s;s what their's excel in; when they &s;parkled, it was with benevolence; when they langui&s;hed, it was with pity; they were not repul&s;ive enough to look a mode&s;t man out of countenance, nor attractive enough to in&s;pire an impudent man with hope; good nature dimpled round her lips, that enca&s;ed two rows of pure&s;t pearls, but &s;corn never pouted in the one, and the grin of folly never was put on to di&s;clo&s;e the other: her voice was melody that kept the mid|dle tones, for it could neither &s;ound the pitch of an affected &s;cream, nor grumble in the ba&s;e note of a &s;ullen murmur: her motions were the expre&s;&s;ive marks that charactered her mind; compo&s;ed and temperate, rage never agitated them; pride never di&s;torted them; light and ela&s;tic when &s;he ha&s;tened to the &s;uccour of the wretched, &s;he neither aped the languor of &s;ickline&s;s, nor the mincing &s;tep of affectation: &s;he danced gracefully, but not like a profe&s;&s;or; loved mu&s;ic, but was no performer; had an eye for nature, but never libelled a &s;ingle fea|ture of it by pen or pencil: &s;he had read &s;uf|ficiently for her years, and profitably for her in&s;truction; &s;he could expre&s;s her thoughts in

Being the only child of her parents, the little bickerings of brothers and &s;i&s;ters never irritated her temper, nor did the triumphs of a rival ever fan one &s;park of envy in her brea&s;t: educated entirely by an excellent mother, &s;he had no communi|cation with governe&s;&s;es and &s;ervants, nor any friend&s;hips with caballing mi&s;&s;es. That &s;he was deceived in &s;uppo&s;ing her heart &s;o pre-occupied by filial affection, as to be una&s;&s;ail|able by love, the&s;e &s;heets have &s;ufficiently evinced; but when &s;he found her&s;elf &s;urprized into a tender attachment, and fully under&s;tood the merits of the per&s;on who in&s;pired it, &s;he &s;corned to ma&s;que her&s;elf in fal&s;e appearances, played off no vain coquetries to teaze and tantalize her lover by affected &s;cruples and counterfeited fears, but with a candour, that re&s;ulted from her purity of thought, gave him to know the intere&s;t he had gained, ju&s;tly con|ceiving artifice need not be u&s;ed to &s;mother a confe&s;&s;ion, which honour dictated, and delicacy might avow.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="109">If I offend again&s;t refinement, by de&s;cribing an ingenuous nature, I make no other an&s;wer but by an appeal to the hearts of my readers, as in like ca&s;es I have done to tho&s;e of my &s;pectators: let them decree! when men of doubtful characters, for doubtful purpo&s;es, ap|proach the fair, let the fair re&s;ort to their de|fences; I am no ca&s;ui&s;t in a ca&s;e of cunning, nor am I fond of working to my point by crooked paths, or de&s;cribing the ba&s;e pro|perties of degenerated nature.

<P>As &s;oon as the &s;uperintendant of the in&s;ane patients had &s;een poor Saunders &s;ecurely ca&s;ed in a &s;traight wai&s;tcoat, and lodged in proper hands, he ha&s;tened to make his enquiries after the lady, who had &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely by the negligence of his people, who had let a crea|ture &s;o wild as Saunders e&s;cape out of their charge. Intere&s;t and humanity conjointly prompted him to pay this mark of re&s;pect and atonement to a per&s;on who was now become proprietor of the hou&s;e and land he lived in. Sir Roger Man&s;tock was acce&s;&s;ible to every body, and of cour&s;e Gordon was admitted: from him he received the whole melancholy detail of Saunders's ca&s;e, and the providential re&s;cue of his beloved I&s;abella from the clutches of a raving maniac, inflamed with revenge again&s;t the &s;ex, and probably bent both upon violation and murder. What were his obli|gations then to the courage and vigour of her defender, when he heard, with horror thrilling through his veins, this awful narrative of the
<PB N="107" REF="111">
danger &s;he had been &s;natched from! His heart ran over with gratitude to Heaven, and ac|knowledgments to Henry.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was Gordon departed, than Sir Roger &s;ent a &s;ummons to our hero, determin|ed to di&s;charge him&s;elf in &s;ome degree of the weight of obligations which pre&s;&s;ed upon his mind, by an in&s;tant acknowledgment of him as the &s;on of his niece, and every offer of an unre&s;erved friend&s;hip in future.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If then he demands my daughter,"</Q> he &s;aid within him|&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"can I refu&s;e him the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what he has pre&s;erv'd?

Here his pre&s;ence was &s;till indi&s;pen&s;i|ble, for nothing but the chearing &s;ight of her de|fender, and his per&s;ua&s;ive voice, could yet allay the tumult of her mind.

Zachary, who&s;e &s;ervices were now in demand, of cour&s;e po&s;tponed his jour|ney, and paid clo&s;e attendance upon his lovely patient. Silence and repo&s;e were the great and only re&s;toratives in reque&s;t; with this view a couch was provided in her dre&s;&s;ing room, and on this was di&s;played the faire&s;t form in creation, whil&s;t at her &s;ide, in pen&s;ive mute attention to each breath &s;he drew, fate Henry, whil&s;t a &s;ervant, po&s;ted without the chamber-door, kept watch again&s;t di&s;turbers of her &s;lumbers. And now the gentle power of &s;leep had vi&s;ited her &s;en&s;es, de&s;cending like the dove of peace with downy pinions on her troubled &s;pirit; one glimmering ray of even|ing light &s;carcely &s;ufficed to &s;hadow out her form, and on this the eyes of Henry invari|ably were fixt, whil&s;t he held her hand fa&s;t locked in his, careful to prevent the &s;lighte&s;t movement, if it were po&s;&s;ible, even of a fibre to awaken her.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the news had reached Doctor Sandford, who, in company with his &s;on, in&s;tantly re&s;orted to Hagley Hou&s;e: even Delapoer him&s;elf, in the adjoining vil|lage,
<PB N="109" REF="113">
had received the alarming intelligence, magnified as u&s;ual in its pa&s;&s;age, and he had al&s;o joined the anxious groupe of vi&s;itors to Sir Roger. Whil&s;t &s;trict order of &s;ilence was ob&s;erved through all that region of the hou&s;e, which was dedicated to I&s;abella, this groupe of friends waited the i&s;&s;ue of her pre&s;ent repo&s;e with anxious hope, and Henry's prai&s;es were in the mean time the general topic of their di&s;cour&s;e: even the mode&s;t diffidence of young Saunders was overcome by the warmth of their applau&s;es, and he gave his voice to the chorus with peculiar glee; for he loved our young hero, and was beloved by him; he al&s;o, at humble di&s;tance, adored his lovely patrone&s;s, who&s;e grace of giving had the power of doubling every bounty &s;he be&s;towed, and Sandford's was the very heart to feel that grace in its full compa&s;s and extent.</P>
<P>Hone&s;t Zachary al&s;o joined the company; he communicated to them with cordial de|light the favourable &s;ituation of his patient above &s;tairs, wrapt in &s;oft repo&s;e and guarded by the pre&s;erver of her life. He then ex|patiated very learnedly upon the di&s;mal effects of &s;udden frights and perturbations, with the different modes of treating them, arguing
<PB N="110" REF="114">
with great di&s;play of rea&s;on, that no one proce&s;s was &s;o efficacious as the &s;ooting attention of &s;ome affectionate per&s;on be&s;t beloved by the &s;uffering object. In the cour&s;e of this di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, the learned lecturer got him&s;elf &s;o completely entangled among&s;t the fibrous rami|fications of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, that after many fruitle&s;s &s;truggles, and as many plunges into deeper difficulties, Zachary left nothing clear to the edification of his hearers, except that love was one of the &s;tronge&s;t of the human pa&s;&s;ions, that the per&s;on be&s;t beloved was decidedly the mo&s;t welcome to the per&s;on loving; that &s;leep was a grand re&s;torer of exhau&s;ted nature; and finally, that it was his opinion, the young lady up &s;tairs would &s;leep the better for Henry's &s;itting by her, and of cour&s;e that his &s;ociety would forward her recovery. To all the&s;e conclu&s;ions, there was not among&s;t the com|pany pre&s;ent one &s;ingle opponent, though Sir Roger, whil&s;t he acquie&s;ced in the&s;e general deductions, cho&s;e to make u&s;e of the word gratitude on the part of his daughter, in place of the broader, and, perhaps, more appo&s;ite term which Zachary had employed on the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>There was indeed one per&s;on in company,
<PB N="111" REF="115">
whom long experience of the fatal power of love, deep &s;en&s;ibility of its effects, and &s;uffi|cient eloquence to have de&s;canted on that topic, qualified to &s;peak what would have been worth the attention of the hearers, had he been &s;o di&s;po&s;ed; but &s;ilence and &s;orrow &s;eemed to have entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of poor Dela|poer; &s;till one ray of hope cheared the gloom of his ideas, and that was derived from the pro&s;pect now given him, by the declared at|tachment of I&s;abella to his &s;on.</P>
<P>Doctor Sandford ob&s;erved to Zachary with a &s;mile, that he did not wonder if he had found &s;ome difficulty, in treating upon love, to pre|&s;erve a due di&s;tinction of ideas, &s;ince it was an affection that &s;hewed it&s;elf under &s;o many &s;ymptoms and de&s;criptions, being in &s;ome ca&s;es an actual di&s;ea&s;e, in others an effectual remedy. The medicines commonly applied for the cure of it, were too often ignorantly admini&s;tered, and few fathers, he believed, were good phy&s;icians in their own families. <Q REND="inline">"Very true,"</Q> cried Zachary, <Q REND="inline">"they deal too much in &s;trong repellants."</Q> A deep &s;igh which e&s;caped from Delapoer, not unperceiv|ed by the company, reminded them they were touching upon too tender a &s;ubject, and at this
<PB N="112" REF="116">
moment, to their general joy, Henry entered with a chearful air, announcing the good news of I&s;abella's amendment; &s;he had waked from &s;leep &s;o recovered and compo&s;ed, that he hoped all effects from her fright would now be done away&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Hold, hold,"</Q> cried Zachary, inter|rupting him, <Q REND="inline">"young phy&s;icians are apt to be too &s;anguine; old ones proceed with cau|tion: we mu&s;t not pronounce upon the cure as perfect, becau&s;e the &s;ymptoms intermit."</Q>&mdash;Sir Roger &s;ubmitted to this doctrine, and though impatient to &s;ee his daughter, &s;uffered Zachary to vi&s;it her without him.</P>
<P>Delapoer now &s;aw a fair opportunity of &s;ounding the parties pre&s;ent, with regard to his wi&s;h of inhabiting the par&s;onage devolved up|on young Sandford; he expre&s;&s;ed his inten|tion, with leave of the incumbent, to purcha&s;e the furniture and effects of the late Mr. Rat|cliffe, re&s;erving an apartment to the u&s;e of the &s;aid Mr. Sandford, a&s;&s;uring him that what|ever he laid out, either in that or any other way upon the premi&s;&s;es, &s;hould remain to his u&s;e and benefit; and as his life would be re|tired and &s;ingle for the re&s;t of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ays, there would not fail to be hou&s;e enough for them both, whil&s;t circum&s;tances remained as they
<PB N="113" REF="117">
were at pre&s;ent.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My motives,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"for wi&s;hing to end my days in this &s;pot of earth which covers all that was dear and va|luable to me in life, are known to Sir Roger Man&s;tock, and I believe I may add, that any promi&s;es I engage for with Mr. Sandford, will be guaranteed by this young gentleman now &s;itting be&s;ide me, who, by deed of gift, is heir irrevocable of all that I am worth. To the head of my hou&s;e, who, with the title, in|herits every thing that appertains to it, I &s;hall bequeath to the full amount of what I have re|ceived, my &s;word and my honour, both un|tainted and no wor&s;e for the wear. Of my great and early di&s;appointment in life I will not &s;peak, for the author of it is gone to his ac|count, and the object of it, alas! is now no more. One wi&s;h remains at my heart, which, if I am indulg'd in, I &s;hall pray for &s;o much life as may &s;uffice for the completion of it; if it is refus'd to me, death cannot come too &s;uddenly. This I will now explain before the pre&s;ent company, hoping they will &s;econd my mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;uit to Sir Roger Man&s;tock; it is, that I may be permitted to rai&s;e &s;ome monument of affection and re&s;pect, to the memory of that beloved per&s;on whom we have lately followed

I have mark'd in my walks about this place, a location, as I think, peculiarly appo&s;ite; and I have work'd upon a plan, (for architecture has been my favourite &s;tudy) which I &s;hall be prepar'd to exhibit to Sir Roger Man&s;tock, when I have his permi&s;|&s;ion for &s;o doing. The workmen and ma|terials are within my reach, the &s;uperinten|dance of the work will be my ta&s;k, the la&s;t melancholy gratification that my &s;orrows will admit of."</Q></P>
<P>A reque&s;t &s;o new and unexpected coming upon the worthy Baronet in this manner, em|barra&s;&s;ed him not a little; he was at no time very quick at a reply, but now was more than ordinarily deliberate in arranging his thoughts. Indeed a &s;u&s;picion had haunted him ever &s;ince his la&s;t conver&s;ation with Delapoer, that grief and di&s;appointment had in &s;ome degree deranged his intellects, and this propo&s;al of the mau&s;oleum very much confirmed him in that notion; he therefore &s;ought rather to evade the &s;uit than to &s;atisfy it, ob&s;erving to him, that the manners
<PB N="115" REF="119">
of the Ea&s;t were different from tho&s;e of Eu|rope; that in &s;ome few in&s;tances edifices of the &s;ort he de&s;cribed had been erected in certain parts of England, but with an effect that did not much recommend them to his ta&s;te; a monument attached to a church he had no ob|jection to, it had a local &s;olemnity, and was &s;eldom vi&s;ited by the ob&s;erver but at religious &s;ea&s;ons, whereas a mau&s;oleum built upon un|con&s;ecrated ground became, like other orna|mental buildings in parks and gardens, a mere &s;pectacle to the curious, and was rarely found to impre&s;s the vi&s;itor with any portion of that mournful re&s;pect, with which the founder of it might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been in&s;pired. Be&s;ides this, it was to be con&s;idered, that Lord Crowbery was &s;till living; and though his in&s;en&s;ibility towards the decea&s;ed, had been &s;uch as to devolve upon her kindred tho&s;e duties and decent attentions towards her remains which properly belonged to him&s;elf, yet this would be an affront that could not fail to provoke his utmo&s;t rancour, and expo&s;e her memory to the wor&s;t in&s;inuations. Upon the whole, he thought it a matter of no &s;mall moment, and therefore &s;hould not wi&s;h to decide upon it ha&s;tily. As for Mr. Sandford's
<PB N="116" REF="120">
par&s;onage hou&s;e, it was a que&s;tion entirely for the parties concerned to &s;ettle between them|&s;elves, he could have no objection to oppo&s;e to a tender of &s;o generous a &s;ort.</P>
<P>The project of the mau&s;oleum being thus adjourned, Delapoer retired with Dr. Sandford and his &s;on, to negociate the treaty for the par&s;onage, when Sir Roger, finding him&s;elf left with Henry, addre&s;&s;ed him as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The &s;ervice you have this day rendered me is of &s;uch magnitude, as no return of thanks on my part can &s;ufficiently expre&s;s, &s;ince there is no object in this world &s;o pre|cious to me as the life, which, under Provi|dence, you have been the means of &s;aving. You cannot therefore tax my gratitude above the value which I put upon your merits, and of cour&s;e I mu&s;t refer it to your own choice and arbitration, to name that favour within my power to grant, which will make you happy to obtain, if any &s;uch there is: con&s;ult your wi&s;hes, Henry, and let me know what it is I can do to recompence the pre&s;erver of my daughter."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The fir&s;t and greate&s;t favour you can be&s;tow upon me,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"is the a&s;|&s;urance of your pardon for the &s;eeming dupli|city
<PB N="117" REF="121">
of my conduct, in keeping &s;ecret the af|finity I have the honour to bear to you, and the pre&s;umptuous love that I have harbour'd in my heart for your adorable daughter. Obe|dience to the injunctions of a tender parent, compell'd me to &s;ilence in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, and nature over-rul'd the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own unworthine&s;s in the latter; for how cou'd I approach Mi&s;s Man&s;tock, and be in&s;en&s;ible to her perfections? how cou'd I &s;ee her and con|ver&s;e with her without &s;urrendering my&s;elf up to love and admiration?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If my pardon,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"be all you have to a&s;k, you wou'd indeed name a very &s;light return for a very weighty obliga|tion: but let us talk in plainer terms; by par|don, I pre&s;ume you mean con&s;ent and appro|bation; when you de&s;ire me to pardon you for loving my daughter, I &s;uppo&s;e I am to under&s;tand it as a mode&s;t way of a&s;king me to give you my daughter."</Q></P>
<P>Henry blu&s;hed and was &s;ilent.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why, truly,"</Q> re&s;umed the Baronet, <Q REND="inline">"your diffidence makes a &s;top without di&s;covering an excu&s;e for it, for whil&s;t you &s;cruple to demand my daughter, you do not he&s;itate to &s;ecure her affections,"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If &s;uch is my happy fortune,"</Q> <PB N="118" REF="122">
replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"the intere&s;t I may have with her is all the merit I can claim with you: to her then I refer my cau&s;e, in her is all my hope."</Q></P>
<P>Here a me&s;&s;age from I&s;abella to her father called him &s;uddenly away, and cut &s;hort a con|ference that was becoming very critically in|tere&s;ting to our agitated hero.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. Love is the grand Specific.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST Sir Roger Man&s;tock attended the &s;ummons of his beloved daughter, Delapoer had brought his bu&s;ine&s;s to a con|clu&s;ion with the Sandfords, and had &s;et out on his return to the par&s;onage: damped and de|pre&s;t in &s;pirit by the chilling reception he had met with from Sir Roger, in the matter of his projected mau&s;oleum, he turned in his thoughts every mode his imagination could &s;ugge&s;t for combating the objections he had heard, and as appearances towards the noble but unworthy widower, &s;eemed the &s;tronge&s;t and be&s;t founded
<PB N="119" REF="123">
bars to his propo&s;al, he brought him&s;elf, after long debate and meditation, to the romantic re&s;olution of &s;etting out forthwith upon a &s;ecret expedition to Crowbery Ca&s;tle, there to demand an interview with the Vi&s;count, and either by rea&s;oning or other means, if rea&s;on|ing would not &s;erve, to return with &s;uch au|thority for commencing his operations, as &s;hould &s;atisfy the delicacy of Sir Roger Man|&s;tock with re&s;pect to oppo&s;ition from that quar|ter. Thus determined, he put him&s;elf in order of march with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, and taking with him a faithful &s;ervant in his po&s;t-chai&s;e, left a note for Henry, &s;imply informing him that he &s;hould he ab&s;ent for a few days upon particular bu&s;ine&s;s, which he would explain to him at his return.</P>
<P>In the mean time Sir Roger vi&s;ited his lovely daughter, and had the happine&s;s to find her in a &s;tate of &s;uch convale&s;cence as pro|mi&s;ed him a &s;peedy and complete recovery. His conver&s;ation with her was tender and gra|tifying in the extreme, for he talked of Henry in terms of the highe&s;t approbation, acknow|ledging his obligations to him with a warmth of gratitude and affection, that encouraged her to throw off all re&s;erve in &s;peaking of her at|tachment.
<PB N="120" REF="124">
To this, in the &s;ame &s;train of can|dour, he replied, that he had &s;een enough to certify the fact, which &s;he confe&s;&s;ed to, and therefore any attempt to vary from it would be highly di&s;ingenuous. It was natural, he owned, that &s;he &s;hould be thus partial to a man &s;o amiable in mind and per&s;on, and what mu&s;t that heart be, he &s;aid, which was not &s;en&s;ible of obligations &s;o important as tho&s;e &s;he owed to Henry? Far be it then from him to oppo&s;e her inclinations: with two &s;uch me|lancholy in&s;tances fre&s;hly impre&s;&s;ed upon his mind, he &s;hould not ri&s;k the fatal con&s;equences of exerting his parental authority to prevent her union with the man of her heart, &s;o long as nothing could be urged to the impeachment of his character. But as time, which was both the friend of prudence and the te&s;t of truth, mu&s;t now of nece&s;&s;ity intervene before their connection could take place, he flatter|ed him&s;elf, that in decency to the decea&s;ed, neither Henry nor her&s;elf would take means to &s;horten it by any abrupt determination: let the &s;ea&s;on of mourning run out its full date, during which he &s;hould impo&s;e no illiberal re&s;traint upon either of them, no le&s;s confiding in Henry's honour than in her di&s;cretion.&mdash;
<PB N="121" REF="125">
<Q REND="inline">"My doors,"</Q> he added, <Q REND="inline">"will never be &s;hut again&s;t the pre&s;erver of my I&s;abella, till I &s;ee, what I hope and tru&s;t will never occur, &s;uf|ficient rea&s;ons for &s;o har&s;h a mea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P>To this I&s;abella made an&s;wer, that her re|collection did not &s;erve as to all that had pa&s;&s;ed, but &s;he well remembered, in the mid&s;t of her terrors, clinging to the brea&s;t of her defender. <Q REND="inline">"In his arms I &s;ought for &s;afety, and I found it; in that terrible moment, the impre&s;&s;ion of who&s;e horrors will never be effac'd from my memory, he oppo&s;ed him&s;elf to the raging phren&s;y of my a&s;&s;ailant, and &s;natcht me from a fate too terrible to think of. Even now my imagination is haunted by vi&s;ions, which no|thing but his pre&s;ence can di&s;pel; when he is ab&s;ent darkne&s;s falls upon my &s;en&s;es, with his appearance light returns; and &s;hou'd he leave us, I &s;hall never know happine&s;s or health again."</Q></P>
<P>The agitation which accompanied the&s;e words &s;o alarmed her father, that he be&s;eeched her to entertain no &s;uch de&s;ponding thoughts, but a&s;&s;ure her&s;elf that Henry would continue where he was till &s;he was in a &s;tate to travel, and &s;hould attend her even to Man&s;tock Hou&s;e, if &s;he wi&s;hed it. With the&s;e a&s;&s;urances

&s;he &s;eemed pacified, and Sir Roger, willing to prevent any further irritation, took the oppor|tunity of Zachary's coming into the room quiet|ly to &s;lip out of it, and retire in good time. Za|chary &s;oon perceived that her &s;pirits had been di&s;turbed, and wi&s;hed to pre&s;cribe &s;omething in his own way to allay them, advi&s;ing her at the &s;ame time to &s;olicit &s;leep, and exclude all com|pany from her chamber.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ah! my good Sir,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"how widely you mi&s;take my ca&s;e: &s;olitude is my terror; I know not when I &s;hall be able to encounter it; I have a horrid image continually before my eyes, and no one but he, who re&s;cued me from the reality, can fortify me again&s;t the &s;hadow. Till I am &s;atisfied that Henry is in the hou&s;e, and that he will not leave it, I can never re&s;t."</Q>&mdash;Zachary a&s;&s;ured her that he was in the hou&s;e, and would have been ere now at the &s;ide of her couch if he had not in the mo&s;t peremptory manner prote&s;ted again&s;t it.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It is not to be told,"</Q> he added, <Q REND="inline">"what difficulty I had to per&s;uade him to &s;tay away from you."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I hope then,"</Q> &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"you will for my &s;ake, as well as your own, never attempt that difficulty any more: why &s;hou'd I re&s;ort to art, when nature tenders me a ready cure?

What I may be brought to in time I know not, but I have not yet lo&s;t my &s;en&s;es, and therefore dark rooms and &s;oporific do&s;es do not apply to my ca&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;he was yet &s;peaking, the room door was gently opened, and a ray of light from one glimmering taper &s;triking on the per&s;on of Henry, pre&s;ented an object to her &s;ight worth all the recipes on Zachary's file.

<P>To this tender petition Henry replied with equal tenderne&s;s, that he was her's, his whole heart was devoted to her, and that he was pre|pared to obey every wi&s;h of her's, though it &s;hould impo&s;e upon him the &s;evere&s;t trial, and, not like the pre&s;ent one, flatter him with a pro&s;pect of the highe&s;t happine&s;s he could re|ceive, that of being allowed to attend upon her in who&s;e pre&s;ence only he could be &s;aid to live. Whil&s;t he repeated this, he gently pre&s;&s;ed her hand, which he &s;till held to his brea&s;t, fondly regarding her with a look of &s;ofte&s;t pity and affection; a &s;ympathetic glow of cha&s;te de|light beamed on her blu&s;hing face; her eyes witne&s;&s;ed the animating plea&s;ure which the&s;e

&s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"that you regard me with pity, as a being depriv'd of rea&s;on, and one who, according to Zachary's regimen, &s;hou'd be kept in &s;olitude and &s;ilence; it may be &s;o, I am &s;en&s;ible I wander in my thoughts beyond the bounds of rea&s;on or di&s;cretion, for grati|tude perhaps betrays me into too much warmth of language, and &s;en&s;ibility in the exce&s;s re|&s;embles madne&s;s; if &s;o, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit, and you mu&s;t treat me as my malady requires; &s;till I will hope that your compa&s;&s;ion &s;ome|times will prevail with you to vi&s;it me in my affliction, and if you find that by your proce&s;s my di&s;order is aggravated, not relieved, per|haps you then will think it time to try what contraries may do, and favour me with more indulgencies."</Q></P>
<P>A deep drawn &s;igh, accompanied by tears, &s;ucceeded to this &s;peech; her head &s;unk upon her brea&s;t, and &s;he &s;eemed &s;urrendering her&s;elf up to an agony of grief, when Henry, no longer ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, and cut to the heart with her con&s;truction of his re&s;erve, ca&s;t him|&s;elf on his knees, and enfolding her in his arms, gave vent to all tho&s;e fond and ardent prote&s;tations, which with difficulty he had hitherto &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: the act and the effect, like

Such was the magical tran&s;mutation love wrought in the mind and per&s;on of our fair heroine! To follow them in their conver&s;ation any further is a ta&s;k we &s;hall not undertake; the language of lovers is apt to be too broken and de&s;ultory for regular detail, and their imaginations a little too vo|latile for &s;ober hi&s;tory; there is al&s;o more of action in the&s;e &s;cenes than can well be brought into de&s;cription, and if attempted to be de|&s;cribed, are they not open to mi&s;con&s;truction, which might wound the purity &s;o characteri&s;tic of tho&s;e per&s;ons, for who&s;e honour we are truly zealous? Let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that though love reigned in both their hearts, honour kept guard over one, and innocence was inherent in the other; re&s;pect tempered the pa&s;&s;ion of Henry, virtue her&s;elf might have acknowledg|ed the &s;en&s;ations of I&s;abella.</P>

<P>WHILST Henry and I&s;abella were thus enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of a vir|tuous mutual pa&s;&s;ion, Delapoer, the melan|choly martyr of an unfortunate attachment, like a wounded veteran worn out in the &s;er|vice of an ungrateful ma&s;ter, was pur&s;uing his pen&s;ive progre&s;s towards the habitation of the Vi&s;count. Deep and dreary were his medi|tations by the way, and not one word e&s;caped him to the humble companion of his journey: his mind continually pondered upon the ob|ject of his expedition, and various were the &s;peeches he compounded and decompounded for the event of their meeting. In all the&s;e re&s;entment was a prevalent ingredient, and the bitter drug of an inveterate aver&s;ion to the worthle&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of his lo&s;t and lamented trea&s;ure, tainted every compo&s;ition he devi&s;ed. Nature had given him, together with a fair and comely per&s;on, a mo&s;t kind and courteous di&s;po&s;ition, but the cruel &s;tings of di&s;appointed
<PB N="129" REF="133">
love had fe&s;tered in his bo&s;om, whil&s;t his travels and campaigns in an unhealthy climate had ha&s;tened on a premature old age, and rendered him feeble and decrepid at a time of life when many others enjoy them&s;elves in full health and vigour of con&s;titution. We have already &s;tated the condition he was found in on board the prize by Henry, and his re&s;cue from that dangerous cri&s;is: grief for the lo&s;s of Lady Crowbery had &s;ince preyed upon him in &s;uch a manner, as not only to reduce his feeble con&s;titution in an alarming degree, but in &s;ome mea&s;ure to impair his mental faculties, of which this chimera of the mau&s;oleum, and the journey he was taking in con&s;equence of it, were no &s;light &s;ymptoms: his thoughts, by dwelling perpetually upon one &s;ingle object, rendered him &s;trange and in&s;en&s;ible to all other matters, and withal &s;o vehement and pertinacious in the pur&s;uit of his favourite meditation, that neither re&s;t, nor food, nor the calls of health, could awaken his attention; and in &s;pite of all the remon&s;trances of his faithful &s;ervant, he pre&s;&s;ed forward on his jour|ney, though he was evidently &s;inking under fatigue, and at the &s;ame time exhibited &s;trong &s;ymptoms of a fever ha&s;tily coming on.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="134">The&s;e indications were no longer dubious at the conclu&s;ion of his journey, and as his chai&s;e entered the village of Crowbery, the delirium had gained upon him to &s;uch a degree, that he was no longer capable of giving orders to the drivers where to go, much le&s;s of executing the purpo&s;es of his expedition. The reader may recollect a certain public hou&s;e on the village green, under the &s;ign of the George and Dragon; this being the only hou&s;e of en|tertainment in the place, thither the drivers conducted our travellers, and there they &s;topt. It &s;o chanced that Ezekiel Daw was at this in&s;tant perambulating the afore&s;aid green, en|joying the fre&s;h breeze of the evening, and his cu&s;tomary pipe, when curio&s;ity led him to the alehou&s;e door to enquire who the &s;trangers might be; and probably the idea that his friend Henry would be found in the chai&s;e had a &s;hare in that curio&s;ity, for &s;ure enough the thoughts of that good creature were at that very time employed in meditating upon our hero, who&s;e ab&s;ence his kind heart very &s;eri|ou&s;ly regretted.</P>
<P>Delapoer was &s;till in the chai&s;e, and Martin his &s;ervant in great di&s;tre&s;s how to di&s;po&s;e of him, when Ezekiel coming up to the door,
<PB N="131" REF="135">
di&s;covered the per&s;on of the reputed Mr. Smith, and no &s;ooner heard, and indeed &s;aw, the &s;ad &s;tate he was in, than with the compa&s;|&s;ion natural to him, he claimed acquaintance with the wretched invalid, and immediately directed the drivers to conduct him to the hou&s;e of Su&s;an May, where he promi&s;ed him a kind reception, and all po&s;&s;ible care and at|tention proper for his &s;ituation. This was gladly accepted by Martin on the part of his ma&s;ter, and executed without delay. Ezekiel &s;trode acro&s;s the green with &s;uch &s;peed, that he was at Su&s;an's door, and had warned her of what was coming, before the carriage got round and drove up to the gate. Benevolence, that glowed in Ezekiel's bo&s;om, was no le&s;s warm in tho&s;e of Su&s;an and her mother; at the call of pity both parties turned out upon the in&s;tant, and as the chai&s;e &s;topt, both with the &s;ame ho&s;pitable voice welcomed the ar|rival of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and &s;ickly gue&s;t. Whil&s;t the women prepared a bed for him, Martin and Ezekiel lifted him out of the chai&s;e, and with the aid of a proper cordial from the &s;tore-clo&s;et of Dame May, &s;aved him from a faint|ing fit.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had got him into bed, and
<PB N="132" REF="136">
provided all things nece&s;&s;ary for his comfort and accommodation, Ezekiel advanced to the bed &s;ide, and having felt his pul&s;e with due &s;olemnity and deliberation, drew Martin a&s;ide, and in a low voice &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Of a truth, friend, I di&s;cover very ugly tokens of a febrile quality in the pul&s;e of this poor gentleman, to whom I pre&s;ume you &s;tand in near degree of friend|&s;hip or affinity, &s;eeing you have exhibited proofs of &s;o much care and &s;olicitude about his per&s;on."</Q>&mdash;Martin replied, that he was the gentleman's &s;ervant, but no le&s;s attached to him than if he had the honour of being his re|lation.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Be it &s;o! be it &s;o!"</Q> quoth Eze|kiel, <Q REND="inline">"there is honour due unto all men, who fulfil the duties of the &s;tation they are in, however humble it may be; and I perceive thou art not one that contenteth him&s;elf with eye-&s;ervice only, as &s;ome are too apt to ren|der.

<P><Q REND="inline">"What then is to become of my poor ma&s;ter,"</Q> replied Martin, <Q REND="inline">"if this is all he is to look to?

a mo&s;t heinous and de&s;picable piece of hypo|cri&s;y.</P>
<P>Ezekiel Daw had now &s;ufficiently develop|ed his own character for Martin no longer to mi&s;take it, &s;o that having heard this harangue without returning any an&s;wer, peace was ef|fectually re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the features of the apo&s;tle relaxed from their rigidity. He then proceeded to enquire what friends or relations Mr. Delapoer might have in tho&s;e parts, whom it might be proper to appri&s;e of his &s;ituation, or if none &s;uch were at hand, what particular call he might have to the village of Crowbery, which cau&s;ed him to travel with &s;uch &s;peed and per&s;everance, to the &s;en&s;ible neglect of his health. To this Martin replied, that he concluded it was bu&s;ine&s;s of no &s;mall importance, which brought his ma&s;ter to that place; but the particular nature of it he was not informed of; however, he under&s;tood &s;o much from what had e&s;caped him by the way, as to believe it had reference to the Lord Crowbery in per&s;on, with whom his ma&s;ter &s;eemed very eager to have an interview.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Enough &s;aid,"</Q> quoth Ezekiel; <Q REND="inline">"his bu&s;i|ne&s;s lieth with the Lord Vi&s;count at the ca&s;tle, and his &s;peed betokeneth the momentous na|ture

of that bu&s;ine&s;s: I do recognize his per|&s;on heretofore in the&s;e parts, when he pa&s;s'd him&s;elf upon me under the name of Smith: there is a my&s;tery at the bottom, that I am not curious to pry into: neverthele&s;s, friend, it &s;eemeth right unto me, that the Lord Vi&s;count &s;hould be appris'd of his arrival, and al&s;o of the malady, with which it hath plea&s;ed God to vi&s;it him, that &s;o the afore&s;aid Lord Vi&s;count may aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t us in this extremity with his coun&s;el, and thereby lighten our re&s;pon&s;ibility in ca&s;e your ma&s;ter &s;hou'd die, which truly I do greatly fear will be the ca&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Having &s;o &s;aid, and no oppo&s;ition being made on the part of Martin, Ezekiel &s;talked away, and with ha&s;ty &s;trides bent his cour&s;e to|wards the ca&s;tle.</P>

<P>THE party we left at the ca&s;tle, con&s;i&s;t|ing of Claypole and his niece, with the Lord of the man&s;ion, had pa&s;&s;ed their time in
<PB N="138" REF="142">
their accu&s;tomed retirement, and received no addition to their number from the curio&s;ity or civility of their neighbours, for the un&s;ocial qualities of the Vi&s;count were well known to all the gentry round about him, and none of them loved or re&s;pected him &s;ufficiently to pay him an uninvited vi&s;it. Among&s;t the various cau&s;es in nature, which tend to corroborate or impair an attachment, we are not curious to &s;earch for that particular motive which had operated to the evident abatement of his Lord&s;hip's pa&s;&s;ion for Mi&s;s Fanny, but &s;o it was, that his ardour had con&s;iderably cooled of late, &s;o as to excite &s;ome unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations in the mind of the &s;agacious uncle, and at certain times emotions of indignation and re&s;entment in the tender bo&s;om even of the lady her&s;elf. Perhaps it would have been prudent in this fair creature, who&s;e per&s;onal charms were her chief, if not her only, recom|mendation, to have hu&s;banded that re&s;ource with a little more oeconomy; but as her uncle had on his part been as prodigal of advice; as &s;he had been of favours, it may be pre&s;umed he overacted his part, &s;o as to force her into mea&s;ures directly contrary to what he recom|mended. Certain it is, that &s;he did not love
<PB N="139" REF="143">
the Lord Crowbery, and therefore we may conclude &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion &s;tood proxy for incli|nation in her connection with that per&s;on|age; whatever this was, &s;he followed it as a guide to matrimony, though by &s;o doing &s;he very much di&s;&s;ented from her uncle's policy, who frequently objected to her in the vulgar phra&s;e of the common &s;aying, that &s;he had put the cart before the hor&s;e.</P>
<P>It &s;o happened, that whil&s;t Ezekiel was on his way to the ca&s;tle, meditating as he walked on the addre&s;s with which he purpo&s;ed to in|troduce him&s;elf and his bu&s;ine&s;s to the noble Vi&s;count, a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te between his Lord&s;hip and Mi&s;s Fanny had taken place, in which &s;ome litle a&s;perity had mixed with matters of a &s;weeter quality, that young lady having taken occa&s;ion to inquire of his Lord&s;hip, what pre|ci&s;e time he had fixed for making good his promi&s;es, by pre&s;enting her with a coronet, hinting in mode&s;t terms, that this was rea|&s;onably to be looked for before &s;he returned the favour, by pre&s;enting him with an heir. Among&s;t various excu&s;es which the Peer had ready at hand to palliate his delay, the recent death of his lady was in&s;i&s;ted on in a manner that provoked Mi&s;s Fanny to advance a few truths upon the meanne&s;s of hypocri&s;y; after
<PB N="140" REF="144">
&s;o public a breach, &s;he ob&s;erved, between him and Lady Crowbery, the world could not ex|pect even the &s;emblance of &s;orrow on his part; that if he had meant to treat her memory with re&s;pect, how came it to pa&s;s that he failed to &s;hew it to her remains, but con&s;igned them to her uncle for burial? She could not therefore regard his plea of her recent death in any other light than as a palpable pretence to evade an act of honour and ju&s;tice, which it would be more manly in him to di&s;avow at once, and boldly face the con&s;equences of his breach of faith, than meanly fritter away both her time and patience with apologies and ex|cu&s;es that were as frivolous as they were fal&s;e. And what was this Lady Crowbery, for whom he held him&s;elf thus bound to &s;acrifice to ap|pearances? Upon what terms did they live? In what temper did they part? Did he &s;tir one foot from his door to accompany her on her way, when &s;he departed from his hou&s;e a dying woman? Had he any love, or re&s;pect, or even pity in his heart towards her, then was the time to &s;hew it; but it was notorious he had not; and it was al&s;o as well known who had; it was no &s;ecret to her at lea&s;t, that Henry the adventurer was the object of her fonde&s;t

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI. An humble Vi&s;itor meets a haughty Reception.</HEAD>
<P>THE terms that fear extorts, cunning commonly finds means to evade. Lord Crowbery had all the di&s;po&s;ition in life to ex|tricate him&s;elf from his embarra&s;&s;ments with Mi&s;s Fanny, and all the regret that heart could feel for having ra&s;hly involved him&s;elf in them. The peace he had patched up was of cour&s;e a dubious one, but at the pre&s;ent moment it was convenient.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant how entered the room, and re|ported to his Lord, that Ezekiel Daw was in waiting, and reque&s;ted to be admitted upon bu&s;ine&s;s of importance. It was one of tho&s;e ill-timed &s;trokes that take a man in the moment of his weakne&s;s. My Lord might certainly have refu&s;ed admi&s;&s;ion to a poor neighbour of Daw's condition, but Mi&s;s Fanny
<PB N="146" REF="150">
had in&s;tantly given her voice in the affirma|tive, and for him to revoke it was to &s;ubject him&s;elf to greater inconveniencies than his confirming it might lead to. It is probable that the idea of Delapoer ru&s;hed upon his mind, when he heard the name of Ezekiel Daw; but a thou&s;and other trifling matters might occur to bring that good apo&s;tle to his door, who was ever bu&s;y in the intere&s;ts of his poor neighbours, and forward to &s;tand forth as their advocate with the rich and mighty. Having therefore put the previous que&s;tion of <Q REND="inline">"What does the fellow want with me?"</Q> and received for an&s;wer from the &s;ervant, that Daw would not communicate his bu&s;ine&s;s; the cau|tious Peer directed his me&s;&s;age fir&s;t to Mr. Claypole, de&s;iring the favour of his attend|ance, and then permitted him to tell Ezekiel that he would &s;ee him for a few moments. In con&s;equence of the&s;e orders, the Reverend Mr. Claypole and the untitled field-preacher entered the audience-chamber, where &s;ate the lord of the ca&s;tle and his lady elect, nearly at the &s;ame moment.</P>
<P>Ezekiel made his reverence, and was told to deliver him&s;elf of his bu&s;ine&s;s in as few words as po&s;&s;ible. <Q REND="inline">"I doubt not,"</Q> replied
<PB N="147" REF="151">
the preacher, <Q REND="inline">"that time is precious to your Lord&s;hip, who &s;o well knows the u&s;es of it; and I &s;hall therefore intrude no further on your patience, than a brief recital of my motives for &s;oliciting the honour of this audience will of nece&s;&s;ity involve. Benevolence, my Lord, as this Reverend Divine can te&s;tify, is a virtue which&mdash;"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"We do not wi&s;h to hear you expatiate upon,"</Q> &s;aid Claypole, interrupting him; <Q REND="inline">"let brevity for once be your virtue, Ezekiel Daw, or patience will not be our's, and you will be di&s;mi&s;s'd without a hearing."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Reverend Sir,"</Q> replied Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"I will be brief, and not put any virtue of your's to a trial, that might perchance be too hard for it. This is my bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;A traveller hath this evening arriv'd in our village, who now &s;o|journeth at the hou&s;e of Su&s;annah May, of who&s;e coming I held it as my duty to adver|ti&s;e the Lord Vi&s;count Crowbery."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And what is that to me?"</Q> cried the Peer, &s;en&s;ibly alarmed.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> replied Daw, <Q REND="inline">"I humbly conceive it is &s;o far forth appertaining to you, fora&s;much as the gentleman, who&s;e name is Delapoer, a per&s;on as it &s;eemeth of high birth and noble family, incontinently &s;eeketh your Lord&s;hip, upon bu&s;ine&s;s perad|venture

of no &s;light importance, &s;eeing he hath travell'd with unremitting &s;peed, to the great detriment of his health, and at the imminent peril of his life; which, if I have any &s;kill in progno&s;tics, now draweth fa&s;t to a conclu|&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P>At the name of Delapoer my Lord turned pale, and was vi&s;ibly in great perturbation: the information with which Ezekiel concluded his &s;peech, was of a more welcome &s;ort. Ral|lying his &s;pirits, he a&s;&s;umed a haughty tone, and demanded of the preacher, if he knew the nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s that Delapoer pre|tended to have with him. To this it was re|plied, that he knew it not, nor was the poor gentleman him&s;elf in a condition to make it known, having arrived in a high &s;tate of fever, which had &s;eized his brain, and deprived him of his &s;en&s;es.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And where are your &s;en&s;es,"</Q> &s;aid Claypole, who knew enough of Delapoer's &s;tory to unravel the whole my&s;tery, <Q REND="inline">"to come on &s;uch an errand? What has my Lord Crow|bery to do with Mr. Delapoer and his deli|rium?

The &s;tranger, who now langui&s;hes on the bed of &s;ickne&s;s, might draw comfort from the pre&s;ence of a noble per&s;on, whom he has &s;ought with &s;uch avidity; and that noble per&s;on (pardon the pre&s;ump|tion with which I &s;peak it in his hearing) might &s;eize the joyful opportunity of &s;uccour|ing a fellow creature in the hour of di&s;|tre&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;aid, and no an&s;wer given, Ezekiel made his humble obedience and retired. Clay|pole, who bore him an ancient grudge, did not &s;pare him on the occa&s;ion, calling him an officious, canting, methodi&s;tical ra&s;cal. Mi&s;s Fanny, who &s;aw her prediction verified &s;o un|expectedly, kept her eyes upon the Peer, &s;e|cretly enjoying his confu&s;ion, whil&s;t he main|tained a &s;ullen &s;ilence, per&s;uaded that the
<PB N="150" REF="154">
whole had been a plot of her devi&s;ing, and more than ever determined to e&s;cape out of her hands: for this purpo&s;e, he &s;oon retired to his library for meditation, where it occurred to him to write to his cou&s;in Captain Crowbery, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he fore&s;aw would be nece&s;&s;ary to him on many accounts, and on who&s;e cou|rage and coun&s;el he could firmly rely. A &s;hort letter, requiring his in&s;tant pre&s;ence, being written and di&s;patched, he found his mind con&s;iderably more at ea&s;e; and to cover his de&s;igns, carried him&s;elf towards Mi&s;s Fanny and her uncle with more than ordinary cordi|ality and good-humour. Claypole, though a cunning man in the general, was &s;o effectually blinded by this fine&s;&s;e, and by the report his niece made of the re&s;ult of her la&s;t alterca|tion with his Lord&s;hip, that he con&s;idered her as Vi&s;counte&s;s elect, and his labours crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. He commended her very highly for her &s;pirit, and ob&s;erved, that fear operated on her lover's nature as the more powerful pa&s;&s;ion of the two; but no matter for that, &s;o long as the object was attained, he would not quarrel with the means. He hoped Delapoer was not ab&s;olutely in a dying &s;tate, but of that he was determined to &s;atisfy him&s;elf very
<PB N="151" REF="155">
&s;peedily, for he regarded him, under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, as a very lucky in&s;trument for quickening his Lord&s;hip's mea&s;ures, which he &s;hould take the fir&s;t fair opportunity of pro|moting, by &s;ugge&s;ting a temporary &s;ece&s;&s;ion from Crowbery, during which the knot might be &s;ecretly tied, and not only the appearances of precipitation avoided, but al&s;o the interview with Delapoer, that he &s;eemed &s;o much to dread: to the&s;e ideas Mi&s;s Fanny on her part very cordially a&s;&s;ented,</P>
<P>When Ezekiel arrived at Su&s;an May's, he had the &s;atisfaction to hear that Mr. Williams, the &s;urgeon, had &s;urprized them with a vi&s;it, and was then in attendance upon the &s;ick per|&s;on. He had obtained his di&s;charge from his &s;hip, and was now come, upon Zachary's in|vitation, to give him the meeting upon the &s;pot, and adju&s;t the preliminaries of their treaty for the &s;hop and trade. Nothing could be more critically fortunate for poor Delapoer, than the arrival of this intelligent young man, who had already rendered him &s;uch &s;ervices, and made him&s;elf &s;o acceptable to his patient. As for Daw, who e&s;teemed Williams, and de|&s;pi&s;ed Kinloch, his joy was exce&s;&s;ive; and it was with &s;ome difficulty Su&s;an May prevented
<PB N="152" REF="156">
him from ru&s;hing into the &s;ick man's room to tell him &s;o. In the mean time, a bed was ap|propriated to Williams in her hou&s;e, that he might be near at hand and within call at all hours, for he had already pronounced upon the ca&s;e of his patient as extremely dangerous. His applications however had &s;uch effect, that before the night was pa&s;t, Williams had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee a change of &s;ymptoms, that augured favourably, and was recognized by Delapoer, with marks of joyful &s;urprize and &s;atisfaction. The meeting between Williams and Ezekiel was very affectionate, nor did his friend Su&s;an fail to give him a reception per|fectly kind and cordial. When he &s;tated to them the object of his coming, they were re|joiced to hear there was &s;o fair a chance of his &s;ettling among&s;t them, to the exclu&s;ion of Kin|loch; and in truth Williams was de&s;ervedly beloved by all that knew him, being a young man of mo&s;t gentle and engaging manners, in per&s;on very agreeable, and of a well-in|formed under&s;tanding, with every thing that could recommend him in the line of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion: at &s;uch times and &s;ea&s;ons as his pa|tient did not need his attendance, he gave the whole detail of his adventures by land
<PB N="153" REF="157">
and &s;ea, &s;ince he had quitted Crowbery; but in a more particular manner he recited every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed from the time that Henry had joined the frigate. This was the mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of his &s;tory to Ezekiel and Su&s;an, who li&s;tened with admiration and delight to the animated picture Williams drew of their heroic friend, and which he coloured to the height, with every warm tint that truth could give, or valour and humanity de&s;erve. Whil&s;t this was in relation, Ezekiel's glowing &s;pirit would break forth into rapture and ex|ultation; ever and anon he would &s;pring from his &s;eat, erect him&s;elf into a martial attitude, and thunder forth his applau&s;es, forgetting &s;ometimes his accu&s;tomed &s;obriety of &s;peech, and launching forth into apo&s;trophes of tri|umph, which, if they did not ab&s;olutely a|mount to a breach of the &s;tatute again&s;t &s;wear|ing, were yet but hair-breadth e&s;capes from the penal letter of the law. Su&s;an's fine eyes meanwhile expre&s;&s;ed the tendere&s;t &s;en&s;ibility of &s;oul, now dropping tears of &s;ympathy, now gli&s;tening bright with tran&s;port, emotions that cannot be thought to have e&s;caped the pene|trating ob&s;ervation of the narrator.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I
<PB N="154" REF="158">
knew,"</Q> exclaimed Ezekiel, in one of his rhap|&s;odies, <Q REND="inline">"that my boy was brave. It was I, and I alone, who fir&s;t di&s;cover'd the innate integrity of his heart; albeit, he was then op|pre&s;s'd under a cloud of accu&s;ations and ap|pearances of guilt: it was I, and I alone, who &s;tept forth in the defence of innocence, and oppos'd my &s;ingle voice in arre&s;t of condem|nation, again&s;t a torrent of overbearing wit|ne&s;&s;es: this good dame, I confe&s;s, took pity on his corporal &s;ufferings, and, like the chari|table Samaritan, pour'd oil and wine into his wounds: I do not aver, take notice, that it was identically oil and wine which &s;he admi|ni&s;ter'd, but it was &s;omething as good, and &s;erved the purpo&s;e &s;he intended by it; the allu&s;ion is not le&s;s appo&s;ite, becau&s;e it is not li|teral; Heaven will con&s;ider the mind, and not &s;crutinize the medicine. He was guiltle&s;s, and we re&s;cued him; friendle&s;s, and we protected him; hungry, and we fed him; had he been in pri&s;on, I wou'd have come unto him even there, for my bowels yearned towards him in chri&s;tian charity and compa&s;&s;ion: and now, behold he is brave, he wieldeth the &s;word again&s;t the enemies and bla&s;phemers of his

faith; he fighteth valiantly in the righteous cau&s;e of his king, his country, and his God. Who wou'd not do the &s;ame? who wou'd not die in &s;uch a glorious conte&s;t?

<P>Here Ezekiel &s;unk down in his chair, con|founded and aba&s;hed, whil&s;t his lips moved and his eyes were turned upwards in &s;ecret ejacu|lation; which Williams ob&s;erving, kept &s;ilence for &s;ome few minutes, and then, watching his opportunity, threw in a few con&s;olatory re|marks, by way of qualifying his &s;elf-reproach, which will be found, by tho&s;e who think it worth their while to &s;earch for them, in the &s;ucceeding chapter.</P>

<P>At the&s;e words Su&s;an &s;hrunk back in her chair, and put her hand before her eyes, whil&s;t Dame May eagerly demanded if poor Tom Weevil was killed, to which Williams an|&s;wered, that it was a mere fle&s;h wound, in no degree dangerous, and which was ju&s;t &s;ufficient to leave an honourable &s;car upon his &s;kin: he then, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Ezekiel, proceeded to &s;ay&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You, Mr. Daw, and the good Dame here pre&s;ent, have &s;ome experience of the&s;e matters, but you can have little if any con|ception of the horrid ca&s;es we have to deal with during the carnage of an action.

<PB N="158" REF="162">
Henry, particularly his humane exertions for Mr. Delapoer, who was found a pri&s;oner on board the enemy's &s;hip, and al&s;o his kindne&s;&s;es to him&s;elf in the negotiation with Doctor Cawdle, he read the heart of Su&s;an in her countenance, and perceived, that whil&s;t he was prai&s;ing Henry, he was recommending him|&s;elf, for this her eyes declared with a &s;en&s;ibility that could not be mi&s;taken. Fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions are not ea&s;ily obliterated; Williams's &s;oft heart had felt tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions early in life for Su&s;an, then in the fir&s;t bud of beauty: time, that had matured her form, had improved her charms, and though there was &s;omething for delicacy to &s;tumble at in the hi&s;tory of her ad|ventures with Blachford, yet there were &s;uch mitigating circum&s;tances to &s;et again&s;t it, that he began to feel in him&s;elf a &s;trong propen&s;ity to wave all refinements, and revert with ar|dour to his fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion. We have already &s;aid, that a more alluring per&s;on than Su&s;an's was hardly to be met with; we may now add, that a more &s;u&s;ceptible heart than Williams's mu&s;t have been a rare di&s;covery in nature; if therefore he was not ea&s;ily revolted by &s;mall dangers, it was a con&s;equence of his being operated upon by &s;trong attractions. When
<PB N="159" REF="163">
they were boy and girl under the &s;ame roof, every minute they could re&s;cue from the duties of their &s;ervice they devoted to each other; at a playful age their love was merely &s;port and playfulne&s;s; as time advanced, op|portunities were more greedily &s;ought, and more ingeniou&s;ly improved; inexperienced youth is prone to curio&s;ity, and the dalliance of the &s;exes is &s;ure to be progre&s;&s;ive; in the path of plea&s;ure there is no pau&s;ing-place, upon which the foot of the novice can re&s;t even for a moment's recollection. So was it with this fond pair; they had no Mentor at hand to break the &s;pell; Jemima was her&s;elf no edi|fying example to Su&s;an; Zachary was no ri|gid moral ma&s;ter to Williams; prudence was not the reigning virtue in Su&s;an's character; &s;elf-denial was not the be&s;t attribute that Wil|liams had to boa&s;t of: as their meetings be|came more delicious, &s;o they contrived to make them more &s;ecret; &s;till they were &s;ub|jected to repeated interruptions, and the inno|cence of Su&s;an was frequently indebted to the petulance of her mi&s;tre&s;s for its timely re&s;cue: but fortune is not &s;uch a friend to virtue, as to work miracles for its &s;ake; and if there is nothing but chance to &s;ave a poor dam&s;el from
<PB N="160" REF="164">
a fal&s;e &s;tep, I am afraid there is but little chance of her being &s;aved at all. In a &s;oft and yielding moment, Su&s;an's protecting ge|nius being a&s;leep on his po&s;t, and love alert and wakeful, Williams <HI>&s;tole unheeded to her chamber,</HI> and, without the church's &s;anction, was admitted to all the privileges of a hu&s;|band.</P>
<P>Furtive enjoyments are &s;eldom le&s;s fleeting than they ought to be. Our lovers were &s;oon di&s;covered in their meetings, and the con&s;e|quence was their in&s;tant &s;eparation. Williams went to &s;eek his fortune at &s;ea, and Su&s;an &s;taid on &s;hore to bewail his ab&s;ence: not that he left her like a man, who runs away from the mi&s;chief he has committed; on the contrary, he tendered to her every recompence in his power, but nothing cannot be divided, and the proferred indemnification was of cour&s;e po&s;tponed till better days &s;hould enable him to invite her to a better &s;ituation. During the whole of his peregrinations, no rival ever detached his heart from its fir&s;t love; he kept in faithful remembrance all his own promi&s;es and Su&s;an's favours, anxious to &s;eize the fir&s;t moment his good fortune might pre&s;ent to him for fulfilling his engagements. Three
<PB N="161" REF="165">
years had now pa&s;&s;ed away whil&s;t he had been beating the round of &s;ervice, with little other gain than of experience in his profe&s;&s;ion. He was now at the age of twenty-three, and Su&s;an had &s;carce completed her nineteenth year, and within that period events had occurred, which &s;tand recorded in this hi&s;tory, that in one &s;en&s;e favoured their union, and in another di&s;|couraged it; but the explanation Henry had given him of Blachford's treachery in the ca&s;e of u&s;an's &s;eduction, had qualified his repug|nance, and converted into pity what would el&s;e have been aver&s;ion and contempt. In the mean time, her per&s;onal attractions were im|proved by years, and his &s;en&s;ibility not abated by ab&s;ence; the only &s;truggle he had now to &s;uffer was his dread of being thought a mer|cenary &s;uitor (for the balance of worldly wealth was &s;trongly on the &s;ide of Su&s;an) and his di&s;covery of an impre&s;&s;ion in Henry's favour, which &s;eemed to him to be paramount to all things el&s;e in her remembrance. Of this, however, time and future ob&s;ervation could alone give him the nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;urance; and in the mean while his attendance upon Mr. De|lapoer would in a manner occupy his whole time, and be a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for his delay
<PB N="162" REF="166">

<P>Whil&s;t matters hung in this &s;u&s;pen&s;e, the Reverend Mr. Claypole, impatient to be in|formed of Delapoer's real &s;ituation, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to gain &s;ome light into his bu&s;ine&s;s, called at Su&s;an May's, and meeting with Wil|liams, was not &s;orry to hear that his patient was no longer in &s;o de&s;perate a &s;tate as was at fir&s;t apprehended. As to the derangement of his &s;en&s;es, concerning which he was particu|larly inqui&s;itive, Williams naturally told him that there was no mental debility in Mr. De|lapoer, except what was incidental to his fever, and even that was con&s;iderably abated. Did he know, Claypole a&s;ked, what particular con|cern he had with the Lord Crowbery, that had brought him in &s;uch ha&s;te into tho&s;e parts?&mdash;To this Williams replied, properly enough, that it was out of his line to pry into tho&s;e matters; but candidly confe&s;&s;ed, that he could collect enough from the rambling di&s;|cour&s;e that his patient would at times &s;tart into, that there was &s;omething on his mind of a very irritative as well as intere&s;ting nature; and it was much to be wi&s;hed that &s;ome com|mon

friend of the parties could &s;ea&s;onably in|terpo&s;e for the prevention of extremities. Claypole, rightly conceiving this to be pointed at him&s;elf, &s;aid, that for his own part he had no commi&s;&s;ion to enter upon the bu&s;ine&s;s; and being a perfect &s;tranger to the gentleman above &s;tairs, as well as to the motives of his di&s;content, he &s;hould by no means chu&s;e to thru&s;t him&s;elf officiou&s;ly into an unwelcome office, but wait till he &s;hould be called upon, when his be&s;t endeavours, as a friend of peace, would not fail to be forthcoming.

Su&s;an together in a moment, and after a man|ner &s;o pointedly commodious for a <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te,</HI> that they mu&s;t have been ingenious indeed to have found means of avoiding it, without be|traying more di&s;inclination towards each other's company, than either of them in reality po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed. The &s;ick man was a&s;leep; Su&s;an had taken up her work; Williams was &s;eated be|&s;ide her; the parlour-door was &s;hut, and the hour was &s;acred from interruption.</P>
<P>Su&s;an kept her eyes upon her work; Wil|liams directed his upon her; both parties were embarra&s;&s;ed, and neither could at once find courage to break &s;ilence. A kind of prepara|tory hum, like the tuning of an in&s;trument, be&s;poke an effort on the part of Williams, this produced a re&s;pon&s;ive note in uni&s;on from Su&s;an, who at the &s;ame time rai&s;ed her eyes from the object they had been fixt upon, and guided them in that direction, as to cla&s;h with his by the way; a &s;oft and almo&s;t impercep|tible relaxation of the mu&s;cles, which none but a lover's &s;en&s;ibility of perception could have con&s;trued into a &s;mile, &s;truck courage into his heart, as an invitation to hope, and the words found way:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"'Tis along age, in my account of time, &s;ince we parted,"</Q> &s;aid Williams.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And

An unmarried mother will never be your object in an ho|nourable light; and neither you nor I have any longer the plea of inexperienc'd youth to excu&s;e our frailties, as once we had."</Q>&mdash;Here &s;he ca&s;t down her eyes, and yielded to a &s;uffu&s;ion of blu&s;hes, that &s;o captivated the enamoured heart of Williams, that by an irre&s;i&s;tible im|pul&s;e he caught her in his arms, and, in a tran&s;port of love, &s;mothered her with care&s;&s;es. A negociation conducted upon the&s;e terms was not likely to be very tedious between parties &s;o tempered as Williams and Su&s;an May.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t to truth,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"that the wrongs you have &s;uffered from that villainous &s;educer only render you more dear to my heart, and more lovely in my eyes, ina&s;much as they add pity to affection, and in&s;pire me with the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire to &s;tand forth as your defender again&s;t all the world, who &s;hall
<PB N="167" REF="171">
dare to breathe a word again&s;t your reputation. By my &s;oul, Su&s;an, if I could flatter my&s;elf that your heart was untoucht by any other pa&s;&s;ion, than that which I fir&s;t planted in it; if I cou'd believe that no happier lover, &s;uperior to me in every point, had effac'd the impre&s;|&s;ion I once made on that dear bo&s;om, it is not all the injuries that Blachford, or a hundred &s;uch as Blachford, cou'd accumulate upon you wou'd hold me back one moment from your arms. No, no, I have no &s;uch principles by nature, nor have I learnt any &s;uch among&s;t my country's brave defenders on the &s;ea, as &s;hou'd induce me to de&s;ert the girl that has favour'd me with her confidence, becau&s;e I found her either plung'd in the extreme&s;t po|verty, or &s;uffering under unde&s;erv'd di&s;grace."</Q></P>
<P>One of the kinde&s;t glances which Su&s;an's fa&s;cinating eyes could be&s;tow, witne&s;&s;ed the ef|fect, which this gallant declaration had upon her heart: it was a &s;ignal of &s;omething more than hope to her happy lover, and produced no common returns of gratitude from him&mdash;but it has been more than once made known to the readers of this hi&s;tory, that we are no dealers in de&s;cription; to recite what is &s;aid, &s;o far, at lea&s;t, as it refers to the elucidation of

events, is all that we undertake for; it mu&s;t be left to imagination to fill up the &s;cenes with action and dumb-&s;hew. After an interval, in which, though the parties were &s;ilent, the bu|&s;ine&s;s did not &s;leep, Su&s;an candidly explained to Williams the nature of her attachment to Henry, giving him a brief but fair account how it aro&s;e, to what length it reached, and where it &s;topt; and this account had a farther claim to his entire belief, ina&s;much as it per|fectly accorded in all points with what our hero him&s;elf had told him in their conver&s;a|tion on the &s;ubject. It was natural that &s;uch a per&s;on as Henry's &s;hould attract attention; it was impo&s;&s;ible that a nature &s;o animated as Su&s;an's &s;hould overlook it. But as honour forbade her to accept his hand, when the hu|mility of his fortune might have tempted him to offer it, &s;o the change in his circum&s;tances, and the attachment he had formed, were now become &s;uch in&s;uperable bars to hope of any &s;ort, that all danger and delu&s;ion were totally at an end: it was clear that nothing had oc|curred which Su&s;an had cau&s;e to regret, and that nothing could occur which Williams had any rea&s;on to fear. Doubt and mi&s;tru&s;t being thus removed, and a mutual good under&s;tand|ing
<PB N="169" REF="173">
e&s;tabli&s;hed with ab&s;olute confidence in each other's honour, Williams renewed his former vows, and Su&s;an &s;crupled not to confe&s;s her former liking: if we had the privilege of the comic poet, who makes marriages a momentary bu&s;ine&s;s, we would couple the&s;e lovers in tho&s;e holy bands without lo&s;s of time, and the rather becau&s;e we are not perfectly &s;ure but that they ought to have been married, or acted as if they had been married; but alas! we hi&s;|torians are tied down to forms, and dare not do them violence, though they might not be &s;o &s;cupulou&s;ly regarded by tho&s;e, whom we have at this moment found occa&s;ion to bring together on the &s;cene. Let it be remembered, however, in the way of palliation, that there is no moment &s;o dangerous to female di&s;cretion, none &s;o favourable to an ardent &s;uitor, as that in which fir&s;t love is renewed.</P>
<P>O Nature, whom alone it is my de&s;tiny to follow, when I attempt to paint the characters of my fellow-creatures, why wilt thou not al|ways lead me through pure and un&s;oiled paths, in the way that I mo&s;t wi&s;h to go, &s;etting up a mark at every re&s;ting place for morality to &s;teer by, and pre&s;enting no one object to my view but what throws a lu&s;tre on the hi&s;tory of

of neighbourly love and cordiality: &s;ee them a&s;&s;embled round the board, hand cla&s;ped by hand, lip &s;ucceeding lip in their &s;alutations to the &s;pirit-&s;tirring tankard, whil&s;t the triumphs of old England, and libations to the health of her brave defenders, circulated round the table, and whil&s;t Williams recounted to the exulting father the gallant actions of his boy, not omit|ting to relate the circum&s;tance of his wound, and the honourable &s;car he would bring home as a trophy of his victory and fame.</P>
<P>A flood of thanks to Williams poured from the hopper of old Weevil's lips, backed with hearty invitations to the mill, and congratu|lations upon his &s;ettling among&s;t them, gar|ni&s;hed with many oaths and prote&s;tations of good will and zeal for his &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"'Sblood! my dear Billy,"</Q> he vociferated in his loude&s;t key, <Q REND="inline">"I wou'd not only be contented to fall &s;ick to bring you cu&s;tom, but damn me if I wou'd not even die to do you credit."</Q></P>

<P>Captain Crowbery, whom my Lord had &s;ummoned to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, obeyed the call, and, having heard the ca&s;e, acted as gentle|men in his predicament mo&s;tly act, and re|commended tho&s;e very mea&s;ures which he found his principal predi&s;po&s;ed to pur&s;ue. It was therefore re&s;olved upon with joint con&s;ent, that it would be advi&s;eable for his Lord&s;hip to take a tour upon the continent, whil&s;t the Captain kept guard upon the ca&s;tle, with full powers at di&s;cretion to get rid of Mi&s;s Fanny and her uncle, upon the be&s;t terms he could make; and here let it be remarked for the edification of my female readers, that tho&s;e very &s;teps, which Mi&s;s Fanny took to &s;ecure her conque&s;t, were urged again&s;t her as the
<PB N="182" REF="186">
fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t impediments to the com|pletion of it.</P>
<P>This commi&s;&s;ion, it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, was not in all re&s;pects the mo&s;t plea&s;ant to the undertaker of it, but it was attended with no &s;mall bribe to his diligence, ina&s;much as in the event of his Lord&s;hip's death without heirs, the Captain was next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to his title and e&s;tate, and it was &s;omething more than probable, on the &s;uppo&s;ition of Mi&s;s Fanny's marriage taking place, that my Lord would not long be childle&s;s. The Captain was a man of &s;pirit and addre&s;s, not naturally di&s;|po&s;ed to put his hand to every mean unworthy job, but too good a politician to oppo&s;e his cou&s;in's will, and not &s;o much his own enemy as to have an unconquerable repugnance again&s;t &s;erving him in a ca&s;e like the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It is not to be expected that his coming at this cri&s;is was the mo&s;t welcome of all events to the uncle and niece, and it certainly required &s;ome management to ma&s;k the plot he had concerted again&s;t them. To Mr. Claypole he talked freely on the rea&s;ons of his invita|tion, a&s;cribing them to the alarm that De|lapoer's arrival had given to his noble cou&s;in, hinting in no very di&s;tant terms at his want of
<PB N="183" REF="187">
&s;pirit, and acknowledging in conformity to his ideas, that the be&s;t thing his Lord&s;hip could do, would be to &s;tep a&s;ide for a time, and leave the matter, whatever it might be, to be made up in his ab&s;ence by deputation, which, he ob|&s;erved, was indeed an unplea&s;ant office, though he was ready to undertake it for the good of all parties, and the re&s;cue of his kin&s;man's re|putation.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;ed tolerably well upon Claypole, who knew enough of Lord Crowbery's want of &s;pirit, to think it perfectly natural that he &s;hould wi&s;h to have the Captain about him, and as this gentleman agreed with his wi&s;hes in advi&s;ing the &s;ame mea&s;ures for a change of place, he &s;aw no immediate danger of his &s;chemes being traver&s;ed, and therefore con|tinued to flatter him&s;elf that the promi&s;ed marriage was in a fair train to take place.</P>
<P>Captain Crowbery had a part al&s;o to act with Mi&s;s Fanny, and upon this he entered with con&s;iderable advantages; for be&s;ides that her character was too open to be mi&s;taken, and her foibles well known to him, he had the requi&s;ites of an agreeable manner, a good per&s;on, great powers of flattery, and a facility of a&s;&s;uming any &s;pecies of di&s;gui&s;e that might
<PB N="184" REF="188">
&s;uit his purpo&s;es. With her he put on a gay and carele&s;s air of a mere &s;oldier of fortune, who con&s;idered her as the lady elect of the head of his hou&s;e, and paid court to her ac|cordingly. This &s;o effectually flattered her vanity, that &s;he &s;eemed never weary of en|couraging his humility with the &s;mile of pro|tection, nor was he deficient in humouring her with opportunities for the di&s;play of tho&s;e graces &s;o conde&s;cendingly be&s;towed. He had enough of that faculty of &s;mall talk to be &s;uf|ficiently eloquent upon in&s;ignificant topics; he could point a compliment, or envelope a double meaning with all the readine&s;s of a practitioner in that commodious art, and in|deed he was not behindhand with any man of modern honour in the true principles of the &s;ect; for he had courage to ju&s;tify &s;eduction, and gallantry to de&s;pi&s;e friend&s;hip, whenever the charms of a wife, of a daughter, or (which is more than either) of a mi&s;tre&s;s came in con|tact with his pa&s;&s;ions, and with opportunity to profit by: with the&s;e accompli&s;hments we need not wonder that he &s;ucceeded in his ef|forts to lull the &s;u&s;picion of a lady not over incredulous; and had his ambition prompted him to higher objects than a little inglorious
<PB N="185" REF="189">
deceit, we may pre&s;ume he would have been no le&s;s fortunate, for Mi&s;s Fanny &s;eemed in a very likely train to overlook both his &s;ituation and her own.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip's preparations in the mean time, were put forward with unremitted di|ligence: as it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to provide him&s;elf for his tour, and &s;ettle his remittances with his banker before he &s;et forward, a jour|ney to town became indi&s;pen&s;ible, and for this he had only to pretend the cu&s;tomary occa&s;ions of con&s;ulting his conveyancer upon the mar|riage &s;ettlement, and providing a licence, to|gether with all other nece&s;&s;ary appendages to a noble bride: The&s;e were plea&s;ant tidings to the parties intere&s;ted, and his Lord&s;hip's pre|parations were cordially &s;econded by the re|verend uncle of the young Lady, who&s;e in|tere&s;t was &s;o much concerned in quickening his departure, that &s;he &s;eemed to have forgot the obvious compliment of lamenting it. There was a concurrence of circum&s;tances, that made it in a manner unavoidable for his Lord&s;hip to invite Mr. Claypole to bear him company on this jaunt; it had its pro and con in point of convenience, but as it was no dif|ficult matter for him to give that reverend
<PB N="186" REF="190">
gentleman the &s;lip in &s;uch a town as London, the offer was made of a place in the chai&s;e with all &s;eeming &s;incerity, and accepted with no other he&s;itation, but as to the point of de|corum towards his niece, who in that ca&s;e would be left to keep hou&s;e with Captain Crowbery alone; but as this &s;cruple was with him&s;elf &s;ingly, and not admitted by my Lord him&s;elf, or the Lady elect, who indeed treated all &s;uch out-of-date ideas with the contempt they merited, it was withdrawn almo&s;t as &s;oon as it was advanced, and the engagement was made.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I think,"</Q> &s;aid my Lord to the Captain on the eve before his departure, <Q REND="inline">"this bu&s;i|ne&s;s will be better manag'd between you and my Madam in the ab&s;ence of the par&s;on, than if he was to &s;tay where he is, and make third-fellow in the fray: two to one is odds in ar|gument, and Claypole is a plaguy pro&s;er, as I &s;hall find to my co&s;t, but I'll keep the wheels going till I have him &s;afe in London, and then I'll &s;oon bequeath him to his meditations: a fellow that has treated his own patron with &s;uch ingratitude, de&s;erves no mercy. As to Mi&s;s Fanny, I don't expect you will find much difficulty in qualifying her anger, for as love
<PB N="187" REF="191">
is out of the que&s;tion, which of all pa&s;&s;ions is the mo&s;t turbulent, you will have only to contend with a little dogged di&s;appointment, and when &s;he has &s;pent her fire in abu&s;ing me, in which I give you free leave to join her, I predict that you will find her as rea&s;onable and as flexible as you can wi&s;h; only let me e&s;cape from her talons, and I have little care what becomes of her afterwards."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's a happy indifference,"</Q> cried the Captain, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"and I can only promi&s;e you I will do my be&s;t to pacify her by every means but marrying her in your &s;tead, which I &s;u&s;pect wou'd not altogether &s;uit her pur|po&s;e, and mine not at all."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ladies of her &s;ort,"</Q> re&s;umed the Peer, <Q REND="inline">"are not intitled to much delicacy, and in my opinion, merit little pity; &s;o that you have full powers from me to u&s;e your own di&s;cre|tion, which, if it de&s;erves the name, will never &s;uffer you to fall into that &s;nare &s;he had &s;pread for me. She has ten thou&s;and charms as a mi&s;tre&s;s, but not one recommendation as a wife: the devil of a temper, and an unbound|ed propen&s;ity to play the devil with it; for whatever &s;he may &s;ay to the contrary, I am in my own mind perfectly per&s;uaded that &s;he
<PB N="188" REF="192">
dealt a foul blow to your antagoni&s;t Henry in the vengeance of her di&s;appointment, and then pretended he had hurt him&s;elf with a knife by accident: therefore have a care of your ribs, George, for if you &s;hou'd fall into the &s;ame fault as he did, 'tis a chance but you meet the fame fate."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"'Tis not ju&s;t the death I &s;hou'd chu&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"nor am I the man in the world to &s;tand out like that young Jo&s;eph, again&s;t ladies who make love with weapons in their hands; I wou'd rather of the two, meet the favour than the puni&s;hment."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Be prepar'd then,"</Q> replied the Peer, <Q REND="inline">"for if I have any gue&s;s, you are not unlikely to en|counter the alternative: for my own part, I am clear in con&s;cience, and &s;hall die in the per&s;ua&s;ion that I am neither the fir&s;t, nor &s;hall be the la&s;t in her good graces."</Q></P>
<P>Here a gentle tap at the door announced the fair &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e in per&s;on. His Lord&s;hip in a moment dre&s;&s;ed his face in its be&s;t trim, to welcome her with looks of love, and with all due regard to truth, de|clared that it was of her and her alone they were conver&s;ing, and that he flattered him&s;elf the tender in&s;tructions he had been giving to

his cou&s;in would be punctually ob&s;erved.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He will tell you, faire&s;t of creatures,"</Q> &s;aid he, fondly taking her hand in his, <Q REND="inline">"for he knows what place you hold in my affections: it is on your account only I &s;ubmit to be a &s;tranger to my own home for a time, but they will be heavy hours of ab&s;ence from my charmer; and Oh! when we meet again&mdash;"</Q> Here his Lord&s;hip thought proper to be much affected, and his voice faultered, whil&s;t the gentle Fanny acted all the ceremonials of a tender blu&s;h, which wanted nothing but change of colour to make it real, and artifice was thus repaid with artifice: meanwhile, a wandering glance &s;tole its way by a &s;ideway pa&s;&s;age towards the Captain, who with infinite gravity of countenance re&s;pectfully liberated her hand, that was then held captive by my Lord's, murmuring in &s;oft accents whil&s;t he &s;ecretly pre&s;&s;ed it in his own.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Come, come, my lovely cou&s;in, you mu&s;t let me part the&s;e hands, &s;o &s;oon to be united for ever: &s;cenes like this will only agonize you both."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI. Breakfa&s;t Table Talk.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning our travellers &s;tarted with the &s;un, whil&s;t &s;leep held the bright eyes of Fanny Claypole in his downy fetters, and &s;pared her the painful ta&s;k of &s;queezing out a parting tear. At the hour of breakfa&s;t, &s;he i&s;&s;ued forth from her chamber, armed for conque&s;t. We have already ob&s;erved, that this young votary of the graces was in the art of undre&s;s eminently &s;ucce&s;sful: on this oc|ca&s;ion &s;he had by no means forgot to employ that art in &s;uch a &s;tile of &s;tudied negligence, as contrived to di&s;play her per&s;on in its mo&s;t at|tractive points, by a &s;eeming carele&s;&s;ne&s;s in tho&s;e articles on which mo&s;t care was in fact be&s;towed; and this we take to be the very fir&s;t excellence, the grand de&s;ideratum of the mo|dern toilet.</P>
<P>A pen&s;ive look, that had an air of &s;orrow for the ab&s;ence of her Lord, was nece&s;&s;arily a&s;&s;umed, and the Captain could do no le&s;s than counterfeit a &s;ympathi&s;ing face of pity
<PB N="191" REF="195">
on the meeting: now we have the experience of human nature to inform us, that when an agreeable young gentleman takes upon him to play the comforter to a tempting young woman in affliction, it is &s;o much like making love to her, that he &s;eldom fails to run one office into the other. The ob&s;ervation was not di&s;credited by the ca&s;e in point, for whil&s;t Mi&s;s Fanny acted her part to admiration, the Captain &s;u&s;tained his &s;hare in the farce of hy|pocri&s;y with no le&s;s &s;pirit and addre&s;s: her &s;orrow was ju&s;t enough to find occupation for his attentions, and not &s;o much as to di&s;courage him from per&s;i&s;ting in them from a de&s;pair of their effects; in &s;hort, &s;he was cheared, and he was flattered by the di&s;covery that his con&s;o|lation was not lo&s;t. In their conver&s;ation, which he took care to regulate according to the point he had in view, he did not &s;cruple to glance at the character of his noble relation, in &s;uch particulars as might &s;erve to pave the way for his purpo&s;e: he &s;tood in admiration at his good fortune, in gaining the affections of a lady &s;o beautiful, &s;o young, and &s;o worthy of a more accompli&s;hed lover: he was &s;orry to confe&s;s, but truth could not be di&s;gui&s;ed, that his cou&s;in did not make the be&s;t hu&s;band
<PB N="192" REF="196">
in the world to his former lady; in fact, his temper was not &s;o good as he could wi&s;h, his heart was narrow, and his di&s;po&s;ition un&s;ocial and moro&s;e: a &s;oul like her's, he &s;aid, wou'd find it&s;elf curb'd and confin'd by rules &s;o rigid as he laid down: what were rank and title if they did not bring happine&s;s with them? and who was there in the kingdom &s;he might not a&s;pire to? In &s;hort, if this was a matter of choice, he begg'd pardon for what he had been &s;aying; if it was a match of prudence, he wi&s;hed it might not deceive her expectations in the i&s;&s;ue of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;inuations, well timed and artfully introduced, had their de&s;ired effect; they &s;aved Mi&s;s Fanny all the pains which hypocri&s;y would have co&s;t her, ina&s;much as they threw Captain Crowbery entirely on her mercy, and put his fate in her hands: had he been guarded in his di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he would certainly have been inexcu&s;ably imprudent to have tru&s;ted him with her real &s;entiments; but when he had &s;o far committed him&s;elf on the &s;ubject, &s;he &s;aw no danger in meeting him with the like candour, and vindicating her ta&s;te at the ex|pence of her &s;incerity, for &s;he was a&s;hamed to be &s;uppo&s;ed guilty of a real liking for &s;o con|temptible
<PB N="193" REF="197">
a per&s;on as Lord Crowbery. Not di&s;cerning what motive he could have for re|po&s;ing &s;o much confidence in her, but that of good opinion and zeal for her happine&s;s, &s;he felt greatly flattered by the turn of his di&s;|cour&s;e, and knowing how ab&s;olutely dependant he was upon his cou&s;in, and that he had been uttering words, which if repeated again&s;t him would never be forgiven, &s;he &s;aid in a &s;tile of mock reproof&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What a giddy thoughtle&s;s &s;oul you are to talk this language to me, and put it in my power to ruin you with my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If ever I de&s;erve to be &s;o puni&s;h'd by you,"</Q> he replied, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hou'd have no right to complain of being betray'd; but if without my de&s;erving you &s;hou'd think fit to do it, the nece&s;&s;ity I &s;hou'd be under of cea&s;ing to e&s;teem you, wou'd be the greate&s;t misfortune I cou'd &s;uffer by the event."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That is very gallant, on my word; but why do you &s;uppo&s;e I am the one woman in the world that can keep a &s;ecret; and what do you think you di&s;cover in me to tru&s;t me with your whole fortune?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Shall I an&s;wer that que&s;tion fully and &s;incerely?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="198"><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"for that perhaps wou'd not be to an&s;wer it favourably; and women, you know, are naturally fond of flat|tery. Don't you &s;ee what mi&s;chief I cou'd make, if I was wickedly inclin'd to it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whatever your inclinations are,"</Q> &s;aid the Captain, looking tenderly upon her, <Q REND="inline">"I wou'd have you gratify them, though my in|&s;ignificant &s;elf was made the &s;acrifice; for after all, what am I but a &s;oldier of fortune, and what is my fortune but the &s;word by my &s;ide? There is my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and that my Lord cannot take from me, or, if he cou'd, he dare not u&s;e it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fie upon you,"</Q> &s;miling, &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"you can't &s;uppo&s;e but he wou'd u&s;e his &s;word in a good cau&s;e."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He wou'd hardly be per|&s;uaded,"</Q> rejoined the Captain, <Q REND="inline">"to think any cau&s;e was good enough for that, I believe. He will never let it &s;ee the light in anger with his good will, el&s;e that young Henry wou'd have brought it out of its hiding-place, for he &s;pelt hard to get a &s;ight of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's a brave lad after all,"</Q> &s;aid Fanny. <Q REND="inline">"I have a right to &s;ay &s;o,"</Q> quoth the man of war; <Q REND="inline">"and now this Delapoer, this man of my&s;tery, hangs over us like a cloud: what

Not the hand&s;ome&s;t woman in the creation, I will boldly &s;ay; not the tran&s;port of being wrapt in tho&s;e arms, which were never meant by na|ture to embrace a coward."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well, well,"</Q> &s;he rejoined, <Q REND="inline">"perhaps it is not the be&s;t u&s;e I cou'd put them to."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What a pity then,"</Q> he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"it &s;hou'd be the only one."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The only one,"</Q> &s;he repeated, breaking into a loud laugh, <Q REND="inline">"&s;urely you draw your infe|rences very nimbly, my good friend, but am I bound to make them good? Do you think that every marriage pre&s;uppo&s;es liking? Can you find no other motives for a connection between a &s;imple Mi&s;s like me, and a titled per&s;onage like your cou&s;in, but a preference that wou'd di&s;grace my judgment, and a pa&s;&s;ion that has no intere&s;t in my heart?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"None, &s;o heaven help me,"</Q> cried the
<PB N="196" REF="200">
Captain, <Q REND="inline">"in your ca&s;e I can find no plea for the &s;acrifice, and I &s;hou'd think my&s;elf bound to congratulate you on your e&s;cape, if you was never more to &s;ee his face."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh! you cruel mon&s;ter!"</Q> &s;he exclaim'd, rallying him, <Q REND="inline">"wou'd you break my heart with the very mention of it? Do you &s;uppo&s;e a married lady is without re&s;ources? is &s;he therefore lo&s;t to all the world, or all the world to her? Are there no happy wives but what are in love with their hu&s;bands? Nay, let me put the que&s;tion clo&s;er, are there no wives in love with any but their hu&s;bands? Come, come, I'll talk with you no longer."</Q>&mdash;So &s;aying, &s;he rolled up a pellet of the bread on the break|fa&s;t-table, and threw it at him in that pretty playful manner, as we have often &s;een it done by many a fair hand with exqui&s;ite addre&s;s and good aim.</P>
<P>If a man knows any thing of modern breed|ing, he knows how to an&s;wer all attacks like this: the Captain made too much of it, for he &s;wore it had wounded him to the heart; there was a little too much of knight-errantry in this, and he did better when he drew a ro&s;e from his button-hole, and gallantly to&s;&s;ed it into her lap, declaring that no &s;oldier ought to
<PB N="197" REF="201">
take a blow without returning it: he had done better &s;till, if he had &s;aid nothing, for at be&s;t this is but the trick and pantomime of coquetry and wantonne&s;s. This is the time when wit is not wanted, and action takes the whole &s;cene upon it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Fanny, with the &s;weete&s;t grace in na|ture, took the ro&s;e and placed it in her bo&s;om, adju&s;ting it with all that pretty difficulty of choice, that rivetted the beholder's eyes upon the charming operation.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ble&s;t flower,"</Q> the Captain cried, <Q REND="inline">"to what a paradi&s;e have I promoted thee?"</Q>&mdash;Then &s;miting his hands to|gether, &s;prung from his chair, and turned to the window, as if to divert &s;ome emotion too violent for his controul.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Come,"</Q> cried the Lady, ri&s;ing al&s;o from her &s;eat, <Q REND="inline">"we have talk'd non&s;en&s;e long enough, let us take a grave walk in the garden, and drive non&s;en&s;e out of our brains."</Q></P>
<P>Her cloak was in the room, the Captain flew to reach it to her, and in a&s;&s;i&s;ting to put it on made &s;o many awkward blunders, and was treated with &s;o many pretty reprimands, that few cloaks perhaps have given room to more raillery, or been le&s;s applied to the pur|po&s;es which cloaks in general are under&s;tood to be made for.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="202">To the garden they went, and here we will leave them to ramble amid&s;t &s;hady bowers and love-in&s;piring grots, not the mo&s;t in|nocent pair that ever took their &s;olitary walk in garden or in grove, yet fairly matched in nature as in art, and fitted for each other. Whither they went, and what they did, we are not careful to recount; for though the ju&s;tice of the hi&s;torian &s;hould be equal towards all characters he is concerned with, yet he mu&s;t be allowed to dwell with more delight, and expatiate with greater felicity upon the ami|able than upon the unamiable; as far as the&s;e prejudices may be deemed excu&s;able, &s;o far I hope I may be indulged in them, and there|fore I &s;hall now drop the curtain upon this &s;cene, as I have upon others of the like de|&s;cription, and clo&s;e the eleventh book of this important hi&s;tory now ha&s;tening to its conclu|&s;ion.</P>

Something there mu&s;t be in every man's view, who commits him&s;elf to the pre&s;s; and as all &s;peculations upon profit are now becoming more and more precarious, there &s;eems little left to animate the adventurer but a di&s;intere&s;t|ed pa&s;&s;ion for fame: I think it is therefore to the credit of the corps, that we &s;till continue to volunteer it with &s;uch &s;pirit, that no abate|ment is yet di&s;cernible either in our numbers
<PB N="200" REF="204">
or exertions. When I &s;earch my own heart for the motives that have operated with &s;uch activity upon me for re&s;orting to my pen, I find my&s;elf impelled by a principle I am not a&s;hamed of, &s;ince it has been uniformly that of doing every thing in my power for keeping alive a general &s;pirit of good humour, and endearing man to man, by bringing characters under re|view, which prejudice has kept at di&s;tance from the ma&s;s of &s;ociety; I have never failed to lend my feeble hand to their's, who are benevolent|ly employed in recommending love and har|mony to mankind: I love my contemporaries, and dete&s;t that language &s;o much in u&s;e, which tends to &s;ink the pre&s;ent age on a compari&s;on with ages pa&s;t; and as I hold this to be an illiberal and ungenerous propen&s;ity, I thank God I have reached that time of life when it is chiefly prevalent, and yet perceive my&s;elf more than ever abhorrent from the practice of it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now &s;end my hero into the world to &s;hift for him&s;elf; I have done what I could for him whil&s;t he was under my care, and have bequeathed him nature for his guide at part|ing. The trials and temptations I have ex|po&s;ed him to, are &s;uch as might befal any
<PB N="201" REF="205">
per&s;on in his &s;ituation, and not greater than every man of &s;teady principles, without any romantic &s;train of virtue or courage, may re|&s;olutely meet. I have not &s;et his character upon &s;tilts for &s;entimental enthu&s;ia&s;ts to gaze at, but kept him on the plain ground with nature's common &s;tock, &s;tudying to endow him with the patient virtues rather than the proud.</P>
<P>To my heroine, I have given as many charms as the reader's imagination &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed to afford her, without being indebted to de&s;criptions, which I reject upon con&s;cience, having &s;o often read them in other noveli&s;ts with &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t; and I flatter my&s;elf, my I&s;abella will appear not the le&s;s attractive for the very few and &s;light demands I have made upon her health and con&s;titution, not having been able to di&s;cover, among&s;t all the numerous examples of &s;ickly and tormented heroines, any peculiar delicacy in their di&s;ea&s;es, or much amu&s;ement in their ca&s;ualties: in one in&s;tance only I have fallen in with the fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>I have kept my narrative free from the perplexities of epi&s;ode and digre&s;&s;ion, and given the &s;cene to my characters without any in|tru&s;ion of my own per&s;on, which I hold to
<PB N="202" REF="206">
be an unpardonable impertinence. Of poetry I have made no u&s;e, and of quotation &s;o very &s;paringly as &s;carce to be perceptible. The incidents, I tru&s;t, are in no ca&s;e improbable; and as to that combination of circum&s;tances, which appears to criminate my hero in the &s;econd book, I have, &s;ince the writing of it, been told of a ca&s;e upon record, which &s;o nearly re&s;embles it as to give my narrative the air of being founded upon fact in that parti|cular, which in reality it was not. In point of &s;tile, I flatter my&s;elf the critic will not find much to reprehend; but in that and every other particular I am fairly before him; let him &s;trike with ju&s;tice, and I will not murmur at the &s;troke.</P>
<P>And now, if this page &s;hall meet the eyes of a certain lady, not le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed for her many amiable qualities than for her exalt|ed rank, &s;he will perceive that I have ful|filled her in&s;tructions, and compo&s;ed a novel, to the be&s;t of my ability, in the form &s;he re|commended and pre&s;cribed. Uncertain of its fate, I forbear to make known who&s;e com|mands I have been honoured with, content if &s;he alone is &s;atisfied with my obedience, and not entirely di&s;appointed with the execution

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. The Hi&s;tory goes back to the Hero.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;udden di&s;appearance of Delapoer, and the &s;tate of mind in which he had departed, cau&s;ed great unea&s;ine&s;s to Henry, and damped tho&s;e joys he would el&s;e have reaped in the unre&s;trained &s;ociety of his beloved I&s;a|bella, to whom every hour of his time was de|voted. Her health was now &s;o nearly re|e&s;tabli&s;hed, that Sir Roger had named a day for his return to Man&s;tock, and that was now &s;o near at hand, that Henry was alarmed le&s;t the time &s;hould not allow for his father's coming back, and till that event took place, or &s;ome intelligence was obtained, duty fixed him to the &s;pot he was in. He knew too well the re&s;entful feelings of his father, and the &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions he had repeatedly thrown out again&s;t Lord Crowbery, to be at any lo&s;s to find a motive for the &s;uddenne&s;s and &s;ecrecy of his
<PB N="204" REF="208">
departure, and tho&s;e conjectures were as pain|ful as they were plau&s;ible; not that he appre|hended any danger to his father's per&s;on from a &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with that unworthy Lord, for he had all po&s;&s;ible contempt for his want of &s;pirit; but it was the impropriety of the thing it&s;elf, and the unfitne&s;s of the under|taker, which &s;truck him &s;o forcibly, and pre|&s;ented &s;o many unplea&s;ant thoughts upon re|flection, that he debated very &s;eriou&s;ly within him&s;elf whether he &s;hould not &s;et out upon a venture, in the hopes of overtaking his father, and di&s;&s;uading him from the interview. The practicability of this, however, was made more than doubtful by the time that had elap&s;ed, before he had intelligence of Mr. Delapoer's departure, &s;o that when he came to confer with Sir Roger upon the idea which had &s;tarted in his mind, that worthy gentleman had &s;o many good rea&s;ons to oppo&s;e again&s;t it, and his own maturer thoughts, prompted withal by an un&s;een advocate, &s;ugge&s;ted &s;o many more, that he re&s;olved upon waiting the i&s;&s;ue of his father's promi&s;ed return; till after &s;ome days anxious expectation, a letter from Wil|liams to Zachary, written after Delapoer's arrival at Crowbery, put an end to all &s;u&s;pen&s;e
<PB N="205" REF="209">
as to the de&s;tination of the ab&s;entee, but gave at the &s;ame time &s;o alarming an account of the illne&s;s he had been &s;eized with, that Henry, apprehending him to be in the utmo&s;t degree of danger, no longer he&s;itated what to do.</P>
<P>He had provided him&s;elf with two excellent riding hor&s;es, and Tom Weevil received or|ders for making ready without delay. The di&s;tance was little more than &s;ixty miles, and it was his purpo&s;e, for expedition &s;ake, to ride part of the way, but there &s;till remained the painful ta&s;k of reconciling I&s;abella to the nece&s;&s;ity of an unexpected parting. This was a di&s;tre&s;sful moment, for though a heart like her's could not &s;cruple to admit the urgency of the call, yet love and tender apprehen&s;ion could not be made to accord, without angui&s;h, to the di&s;appointment. Neither was Sir Roger him&s;elf a di&s;intere&s;ted party in the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of this unwelcome bu&s;ine&s;s; for when he &s;aw the &s;truggle it occa&s;ioned to the fond, yet candid heart of I&s;abella, he offered to &s;et out the next morning with his whole fa|mily, if Henry would bear them company; but as Sir Roger's equipage was in the &s;tile of ancient times, and bore not the lea&s;t &s;imili|tude
<PB N="206" REF="210">
to a mail-coach, a di&s;tance of &s;ixty miles was to him a journey of two days, whil&s;t our hero's impatience did not mean to appropriate more than &s;ix hours to the road; a compromi&s;e was therefore &s;truck upon by Henry, who engaged to come back and give them the meeting at the inn where they re&s;ted for the night, unle&s;s he found his father's &s;ituation &s;uch as to prevent it. This was eagerly em|braced by I&s;abella, who, at parting from him with eyes full of tears, and a look of the tendere&s;t affection, &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"Go, then, and may &s;ucce&s;s attend you! Remember only you have that in charge, which is infinitely dearer to me than the life you have pre|&s;erv'd."</Q></P>
<P>His hor&s;es were at the door, duty pre&s;&s;ed, time was on the wing, he &s;natched a ha&s;ty adieu, and, light as Per&s;eus, or the eque&s;trian &s;on of Leda, &s;prung into the &s;addle, and was out of &s;ight in an in&s;tant&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He is gone,"</Q> cried Zachary, who, with Sir Roger and I&s;a|bella, had attended him to the door," <Q REND="inline">he is off like a &s;hot; 'tis a rare thing to be young and nimble; but after all, I'm afraid his labour will be lo&s;t, and he will come too late, for I augur ill from Williams's account of Mr. De|lapoer's
<PB N="207" REF="211">
ca&s;e."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Heaven forbid!"</Q> cried I&s;a|bella, <Q REND="inline">"that any &s;uch unhappine&s;s as you pre|dict &s;hou'd befal him."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Come, come,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"we will not anticipate mi&s;|fortunes."</Q>&mdash;Then taking I&s;abella's arm under his, walked forth to give his orders to the &s;er|vants without doors for the next day's journey.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I perceive, my dear child,"</Q> &s;aid he as they pa&s;&s;ed along, <Q REND="inline">"tho' your life has been &s;av'd by your friend who has ju&s;t left us, your heart is irrecoverably lo&s;t. It behoves us therefore to con&s;ider what you have &s;ub&s;tituted in its place, that &s;o we may compute and &s;trike the balance between profit and lo&s;s. If I did not think as highly of Henry's virtues, and predict as favourably of his temper, as an old man like me ought in rea&s;on to do of a young one like him, I &s;hou'd contemplate my lovely I&s;abella's &s;ituation with alarm and terror; for tho' I &s;hou'd not de&s;pair but my authority might prevent imprudence, I fear it wou'd not &s;erve to extingui&s;h love: it demands therefore all the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion that I entertain for Henry's character to bring me to acquie&s;ce, as you may now perceive I do, in your decided attach|ment to him. I own to you, my I&s;abella, I once thought no circum&s;tances cou'd have induced
<PB N="208" REF="212">
me to favour a connection with him or any per&s;on under his predicament; but it &s;eems as if Providence had decreed, that, in &s;pite of all my prejudices, I &s;hou'd be compell'd by the force of facts to be the convert of his virtues, and renounce my oppo&s;ition to him. How &s;trongly have events con&s;pir'd to mark this out, &s;ince fortune fir&s;t made him known to us by throwing him in the la&s;t extremity of di&s;tre&s;s upon the unexpected protection of a my&s;terious mother! What an e&s;cape had he from the murderous de&s;igns af Blachford, and the de&s;perate rage of that infuriated wanton! What perils did he incur in the boarding of the Frenchman! and what but the hand of Heaven it&s;elf cou'd &s;o critically conduct him to your re&s;cue in the la&s;t awful in&s;tant, that &s;tood betwixt you and a di&s;a&s;ter too terrible to think upon! How &s;ingular was the chance by which I di&s;cover'd that po&s;thumous and impor|tant writing of Sir Andrew Adamant, addre&s;s'd to me in his behalf, and which &s;eem'd to have lain conceal'd for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of bringing it to light in the happie&s;t moment for his intere&s;t and advantage! The very ca&s;e of that wretched maniac, from who&s;e hands he &s;natch'd you, had a moral in the hi&s;tory of his madne&s;s, that
<PB N="209" REF="213">
applied it&s;elf to my conviction: but when to the&s;e I add, the very &s;triking circum&s;tances that attended his meeting with his father, and reflect upon his uncommon genero&s;ity in the ca&s;e of Blachford's will, and again in that of Lady Crowbery, how can I &s;ay he is not de|&s;erving of your affection, or any longer interpo&s;e between him and the happine&s;s he &s;eems de&s;tin'd to enjoy?"</Q></P>
<P>Here Sir Roger concluded, whil&s;t his at|tentive hearer &s;till waited in re&s;pectful &s;ilence; but perceiving after a pau&s;e that he now ex|pected her reply, &s;he turned upon him the mo&s;t lovely countenance in nature, and&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear father,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"think not that I have been &s;ilent becau&s;e I wanted gra|titude for your goodne&s;s, but becau&s;e I feel it to an exce&s;s that &s;tifles my expre&s;&s;ions. I tru&s;t I never cou'd act in oppo&s;ition to your will; but I wou'd fain not entertain even a wi&s;h in contradiction to your judgment: had you therefore interdicted my attachment to Henry, I mu&s;t, and I wou'd have &s;trove to have torn him from my heart, terrible although the &s;truggle would have been; but when I hear his prai&s;es from your lips, and receive your &s;anction to confirm me in my choice,
<PB N="210" REF="214">
words cannot &s;peak the happine&s;s you be&s;tow upon me, and if I did not &s;ooner make reply, it was becau&s;e I was loth to interrupt you on a &s;ubject I cou'd li&s;ten to for ever."</Q></P>
<P>In the mean time Henry, thus ever pre&s;ent to the thoughts of his I&s;abella, proceeded bri&s;kly towards the de&s;tination where his duty called him. New affections had been &s;tirred within his bo&s;om by the di&s;covery of his parents; but hard fortune, which had already bereft him of a mother, lo&s;t as &s;oon as known, and beloved only to be bewailed, &s;eemed now in the cruel di&s;po&s;ition to deprive him of his father al&s;o. This and his meditations on the dear object he had newly parted from, were his companions by the way, and hone&s;t Wee|vil, who followed him, had full &s;cope to in|dulge his own imagination without let or hin|drance, till our hero, having mea&s;ured more than half the way, found him&s;elf at the inn, where Sir Roger propo&s;ed to take up his re&s;t. Here he left Tom and his hor&s;es, and having delivered to the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e the ne|ce&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions for the reception of his gue&s;ts next day, he took po&s;t and proceeded with all po&s;&s;ible expedition towards Crow|bery.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="215">The day had clo&s;ed when Henry arrived at Su&s;an's ho&s;pitable door, and was received by Williams with a chearful countenance, that be&s;poke the happy report he had to make of his patient's amendment. Delapoer had quitted his &s;ick chamber, and was &s;itting in the par|lour; great was his joy at the &s;ight of Henry, cla&s;ping him in his arms and ble&s;&s;ing his good providence, that he had &s;urvived to &s;ee him once again: of his obligations to Williams, who had now for the &s;econd time re&s;cued him from death, he &s;poke in the warme&s;t terms, and not le&s;s gratefully of hone&s;t Ezekiel and the kind women, who&s;e tender care and &s;oli|citude had contributed to re&s;tore him. He confe&s;t the object of his journey had been a &s;udden re&s;olution of &s;eeking Lord Crowbery, in con&s;equence of the objection &s;tarted by Sir Roger Man&s;tock, with re&s;pect to his projected mau&s;oleum. <Q REND="inline">"And what,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"might have been the con&s;equence of our meeting, had it taken place, I will not pre&s;ume to &s;ay; certain it is, that &s;econd thoughts and a calmer &s;tate of mind, have placed that project in another light from what it fir&s;t appeared in to me, when under the impre&s;&s;ion of a recent di&s;appointment: I have now renounced it, and
<PB N="212" REF="216">
think it a lucky circum&s;tance, that the wretch I came in &s;earch of is out of my reach, and gone from home to prepare, as it is &s;aid, for a &s;econd marriage with the niece of Mr. Clay|pole, now re&s;iding at the ca&s;tle."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Unfeeling, &s;hamele&s;s profligate,"</Q> exclaim|ed Henry, with indignation and a&s;toni&s;hment; <Q REND="inline">"will he &s;o gro&s;sly in&s;ult the virtuous me|mory of his injured wife, as to plot a &s;econd marriage before &s;he is &s;carce cold in her cof|fin; and with the niece of Claypole wou'd he marry? Is Fanny Claypole of all women breath|ing to be the Lady Crowbery, that &s;o ha&s;tily &s;ucceeds to my unhappy mother? be it &s;o! if he is &s;o rank of &s;oul as to &s;et decency at de|fiance, let him couple with a fury, and may his pa&s;&s;ion be his plague! I know her well, and if Providence for his &s;ins &s;hall &s;urrender him into her hands, you and I, my good Sir, may let our vengeance &s;leep; his puni&s;hment is provided for, the ta&s;k is taken out of our hands, and the tyrant over others is his own executioner."</Q></P>
<P>The evening was now in advance, and though Delapoer's &s;pirits were greatly exhi|lerated by the arrival of his &s;on, yet, in con&s;i|deration of his &s;trength, the conver&s;ation was not protracted beyond the time that Williams

<P>AS &s;oon as Delapoer had retired to his chamber, Su&s;an May and her mother pre&s;ented them&s;elves to Henry, and were met by him with all the warmth of former affec|tion. The good dame as u&s;ual was loqua|cious in her joy, and had many que&s;tions and enquiries to be re&s;olved: Su&s;an's &s;en&s;ibility was of a more &s;ilent &s;ort, and whil&s;t &s;he greet|ed him with &s;miles of gratitude and love, the tear gli&s;tened in her eye, and the blu&s;h glowed upon her cheek.</P>
<P>Henry &s;aw her emotion, and perfectly un|der&s;tood the cau&s;e of it, making a plea there|fore of his impatience to &s;ee Ezekiel, he cut &s;hort the interview, ob&s;erving, that the evening ju&s;t &s;erved him to &s;natch a &s;ight of his friend,
<PB N="214" REF="218">
over his concluding pipe, before he turned in to his cockloft. He proceeded to the cottage, and opening the door without ceremony, di&s;|covered the rural apo&s;tle &s;eated in his chair of meditation, with his back towards him, and too deep in thought to be rou&s;ed by &s;o quiet a vi&s;itor. Henry &s;topt and contemplated him for a few moments, with a placid delight: <Q REND="inline">"Kind &s;oul,"</Q> he &s;aid within him&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"thy thoughts are occupied in benevolence, and thy communications are with Heaven!"</Q> Then going up to him, and putting his hands upon his &s;houlders over the back of his wicker throne, called upon him by name, to wake from thought and welcome a friend. Ezekiel &s;tarted at the well-known voice, &s;prung from his chair, and threw him&s;elf upon Henry's neck: <Q REND="inline">"Prai&s;ed be Heaven!"</Q> he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"prai&s;ed be Heaven! I am ble&s;t above my hopes in embracing thee once more, thou child of my affection."</Q> He then took two or three &s;trides acro&s;s the room, rubbing his hands and crying out; <Q REND="inline">"What wilt eat? what wilt drink? I warrant thou art fa&s;ting, fre&s;h from &s;ea."</Q></P>
<P>Henry &s;miled at Ezekiel's want of recollec|tion, and &s;topping him as he was po&s;ting to
<PB N="215" REF="219">
the &s;tore where he kept his provi&s;ions, told him that the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him was all the refre&s;hment he &s;tood in need of for the pre&s;ent. The good man now became a little more collected, but &s;till ran from &s;ubject to &s;ubject, mi&s;taking many things that he might have recollected, and repeating others Henry was already informed of; &s;uch as the death of Jemima Cawdle, the arrival of Williams, the reports about Lord Crowbery, and other anecdotes neither quite new, nor over-intere&s;t|ing in his relation of them; yet our hero had patience for them all, and in the end was re|paid for that patience, by hearing that the wretched Jemima had, by Ezekiel's a&s;&s;iduous remon&s;trances, been brought to a due &s;en&s;e of her condition, and a better train of thoughts in her latter moments: what money &s;he had &s;craped together, &s;he bequeathed to her hu&s;|band, and every thing in which Zachary was intere&s;ted, had been faithfully and di&s;creetly admini&s;tered by Daw him&s;elf, with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of old Tom Weevil the miller.</P>
<P>Ezekiel's &s;pirits were now &s;o thoroughly awake, that Henry would hardly have pre|vailed with him to think it was time to go to re&s;t, had he not pretended that he &s;tood in
<PB N="216" REF="220">
want of it him&s;elf. He found his friends at next door expecting his return, and every thing &s;et in order for his comfort and repo&s;e, that Su&s;an's ho&s;pitable care and attention could provide.</P>
<P>The next morning brought Williams to his bed-&s;ide, with the chearing intelligence, that he could now with confidence pronounce his patient to be out of danger. His apprehen|&s;ions thus allayed, he felt him&s;elf at liberty to make good his conditional engagement to I&s;abella, for which he made the nece&s;&s;ary pre|parations. After devoting the whole fore|noon to his father, and declining his generous offers of an immediate e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;uitable to the heir of an ample fortune, he left him highly &s;atisfied with the errand he was going upon, and much delighted with the happy pro&s;pect it &s;eemed to open on his future hopes.</P>
<P>Relieved from his alarms about the friend he left behind him, and impatient to meet the beloved object towards whom his cour&s;e was now directed, our hero with a joyful heart, whil&s;t the chai&s;e whirled him rapidly along, counted every mile that dimini&s;hed his di&s;tance from I&s;abella. Sir Roger with
<PB N="217" REF="221">
the punctuality that governed all his motions, had calculated to a minutene&s;s the time of his arrival at the inn. It was a full hour before this given time, when Henry's well-feed po&s;tilions drove their panting hor&s;es to the door. His fir&s;t care was to examine if the hou&s;e was in a &s;tate of preparation for their expected gue&s;ts; and it was with &s;atisfaction he &s;aw, that all his in&s;tructions had been punc|tually obeyed; when this was done, and the little derangements of his dre&s;s repaired, he found him&s;elf at lei&s;ure to make the proper enquiries after Tom and his cavalry: the brave lad &s;oon appeared upon the &s;ummons, and gave a good account of his charge; he al&s;o informed his ma&s;ter, that part of Sir Roger's &s;uite were arrived, and that the coach was near at hand with all well within-&s;ide of it.</P>
<P>At length the much-wi&s;hed-for moment arrived, that brought the cavalcade in view, and Henry at the coach-door received a hand in his, who&s;e touch in&s;pired him with delight. All inquiries made and re&s;olved, I&s;abella now, with Henry &s;eated be&s;ide her, all her fond fears di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and greeted with the &s;mile of approbation from her beloved father, felt that tran&s;cendent glow of &s;oul, which is the ex|clu&s;ive
<PB N="218" REF="222">
property of virtuous love, and Hea|ven's be&s;t gift to the thrice-ble&s;&s;ed few that merit it. No traces of her late di&s;order were any longer to be &s;een; her animated counte|nance beamed with &s;uch lu&s;trous beauty, health and joy, as made it dazzling to behold. Henry gazed in &s;peechle&s;s rapture; Sir Roger him&s;elf &s;ate in fixed contemplation, and the very people who attended upon the gue&s;ts, &s;eemed to make errands into the room, for the purpo&s;e of treating them&s;elves with a glimp&s;e of the lovely &s;tranger. Uncon&s;cious of her charms, until &s;he &s;aw them in the gla&s;s of Henry's face, &s;he no &s;ooner perceived the tran&s;port they excited, than &s;he dropped her eyes with mode&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, and was co|vered with blu&s;hes.</P>
<P>Enraptured at the &s;ight, Henry could no longer command him&s;elf, though in the pre|&s;ence of Sir Roger: <Q REND="inline">"Pardon me,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"thou lovelie&s;t of women, for oppre&s;&s;ing thee with my admiration; and you my patron and protector, be my advocate &s;o far, as to confe&s;s that her beauty is irre&s;i&s;tible."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why in very truth, Henry,"</Q> &s;aid the Baronet, <Q REND="inline">"if you could look upon that form without rapture, I mu&s;t think you wou'd not be &s;o worthy as
<PB N="219" REF="223">
you are of an intere&s;t in her heart."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"How generous is that apology!"</Q> exclaimed the hap|py youth; <Q REND="inline">"how flattering to my pre&s;umptu|ous hopes! by Heaven, I wou'd go to death for the father of my I&s;abella!"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You have done more than that for me,"</Q> replied Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"when you pre&s;erved my child: &s;he is, under Providence, your gift to me; what can I do le&s;s than endow you with that ble&s;&s;ing you &s;o gallantly redeemed?"</Q></P>
<P>The gratitude and joy which Henry now felt, were not to be expre&s;&s;ed by words; his fir&s;t impul&s;e was to throw him&s;elf at Sir Ro|ger's feet: a motion on the part of that gen|tleman, which forbade the attempt, and a cer|tain look, which reminded him of the place he was in, brought him to in&s;tant recollection; yet he &s;eized his hand with ardour, and pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips: I&s;abella's beauteous and blu&s;h|ing countenance in the mean while took a deeper tint; &s;he too like Henry was &s;ilent. The good Baronet under&s;tood enough of na|ture to interpret rightly for both parties, and accordingly took an early occa&s;ion to relieve their &s;en&s;ations, by &s;tarting &s;ome topic more appo&s;ite to the place they were in; but a more effectual &s;top was &s;oon put to all conver&s;ation
<PB N="220" REF="224">
on this &s;ubject, by the preparations for &s;up|per, and the bu&s;tle tho&s;e manoeuvres never fail to produce among&s;t the waiters of an inn. The joy, however, which our hero now expe|rienced, was too di&s;coverable to be overlooked by her who was the cau&s;e of it: how far her own &s;en&s;ations accorded with it, was only to be gue&s;&s;ed at by the &s;agacity of a lover; for mode&s;t timidity kept in check all emotions that might lead to ob&s;ervation, and nature only &s;hewed her&s;elf in a complacent &s;mile, and now and then a tender glance, that e&s;caped as it were involuntarily and by &s;urprize.</P>
<P>Sir Roger, meanwhile, was in high good-humour with every body and every thing: exerci&s;e had given him appetite, and he had a heart to partake of the happine&s;s he had be|&s;towed; he declared his entertainment to be excellent, chatted familiarly with the landlord, prai&s;ed his hou&s;e, and promi&s;ed never to pa&s;s it without a call. There is certainly &s;omething in an inn, which, by contra&s;t with other &s;cenes, is oftentimes found highly plea&s;ing; it gives an ea&s;e and relaxation from tho&s;e dome&s;tic at|tentions which, though they may not be irk|&s;ome in general, are &s;ometimes interruptions to occupations more amu&s;ing. It may be
<PB N="221" REF="225">
pre&s;umed Sir Roger felt it at this time, and we agree with him in the following remark&mdash;That the man, who cannot find contentment in a decent Engli&s;h inn, is a four unplea&s;ant fellow, and a companion no one would wi&s;h to travel with.</P>
<P>Moments, pa&s;&s;ed thus happily, pa&s;s quick|ly, and our lovers found them&s;elves &s;ummoned to their repo&s;e, before they were &s;en&s;ible of any wi&s;h for it. The next morning they were early &s;tirring, for Sir Roger propo&s;ed reach|ing home by dinner-time, whil&s;t Henry on, hor&s;eback took a circuit by Crowbery, under promi&s;e of coming to Man&s;tock Hou&s;e in the evening, if he found nothing to prevent him on his vi&s;it to his father. As far as to the point where his road branched off, he accom|panied Sir Roger and his beloved mi&s;tre&s;s; who&s;e look at parting told him how unwel|come the moment was that carried him out of &s;ight: from this intimation he very natu|rally inferred, that the interval of ab&s;ence was not to be lengthened by his voluntary delay; no &s;ooner, therefore, had he uttered the word 'Farewell!' than, giving the reins to his hor&s;e, he put him to a pace that made quick di&s;patch with the &s;olitary remainder of his way.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="226">He was welcomed by Williams on his re|turn, with the &s;ame good news, and had the happine&s;s to find his father advancing fa&s;t in his recovery. Williams was &s;till &s;ole manager in office, though Zachary was arrived. The good man was certainly not apt to under|value his own abilities, but in this ca&s;e he made no attempt to interpo&s;e his advice for any change of &s;y&s;tem, which probably would not have been accepted by Delapoer, from the fir&s;t authority in England. As for Doctor Zachary Cawdle, Surgeon, Apothecary, and Man-Midwife, though his name and titles &s;till glittered on the &s;ky-blue &s;croll, that be|&s;trode the po&s;terns of his gate, yet had he now touched the happy period that clo&s;ed his medical career, and delivered him bodily over to ea&s;e, indolence, and the gout for the re&s;t of his days. The annuity devi&s;ed by Lady Crowbery, and Jemima's beque&s;t, made up a comfortable independency; and it was for the purpo&s;e only of introducing his &s;ucce&s;|&s;or into bu&s;ine&s;s with a better grace, that he kept his name in the firme; as to all money arrangements for &s;tock in hand, good will, or any other de&s;cription of particulars, Delapoer him&s;elf had &s;o generou&s;ly &s;tood forward in
<PB N="223" REF="227">
that e&s;&s;ential part of the negociation, that no|thing was left to the chance and uncertainty of any after-reckoning between the contract|ing parties.</P>
<P>Having thus di&s;po&s;ed of our hone&s;t Doctor, we &s;hall probably find little other occa&s;ion to call upon him, in the further progre&s;s of this hi&s;tory, except with our hearty good wi&s;hes for health and long life, to enjoy the tranquil|lity and repo&s;e, which his good fortune has provided for him.</P>
<P>As for Sawney Kinloch, he by his own choice &s;eceded from the &s;hop, and beat his retreat to his beloved town of Aberdeen, with a fortune which, reduced into Scotch pounds, made no contemptible di&s;play in his own coun|try;&mdash;an example, among&s;t many others, of the very extraordinary things which clo&s;e and per&s;evering oeconomy can effect.</P>

<P>WILLIAMS now found him&s;elf in con|dition to think &s;eriou&s;ly of matrimony, without the painful &s;en&s;ation of con&s;idering
<PB N="224" REF="228">
him&s;elf as the pen&s;ioner of a wife: Su&s;an on her part had all due partiality for him, and there can be little doubt but he was &s;atisfied with the proofs of it; yet the arrival of Henry was an incident of &s;ome importance, and the effects of it had been watched by Williams with all that attention, which wary lovers are apt to be&s;tow upon a new-comer, whom they &s;u&s;pect to be in greater favour than them|&s;elves. Su&s;an's deportment, however, had been &s;uch, that the re&s;ult of this &s;crutiny had not been unfavourable to her, or di&s;couraging to her admirer: the &s;ame &s;mile was re&s;erved for Williams when they met in private; and if occa&s;ionally a cloud was &s;een to pa&s;s over her brow, or a &s;igh to e&s;cape from her bo&s;om, the voice of love &s;oon re&s;tored her to peace; he was therefore firmly bent upon rivetting the nuptial chain, yet a previous word or two with Henry, by way of preface to the awful deed, was anxiou&s;ly &s;ought by him; and as our hero's vi&s;its to his father were daily re|peated, that opportunity &s;oon offered it&s;elf; when the following dialogue took place.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have fully reflected,"</Q> &s;aid Williams, <Q REND="inline">"upon our friend Su&s;an's &s;ituation in life, and I think I may &s;ay truly and without re&s;erve,
<PB N="225" REF="229">
that my feelings are entirely reconciled to put up with the con&s;equences of her involuntary connection with the father of her child. If my mind was not made up upon this point to a perfect acquie&s;cence for all time to come, I wou'd not do her, as well as my&s;elf, &s;o ba&s;e a wrong as to engage with her on any terms; but repre&s;ented as the tran&s;action has been to me, (and I cannot doubt the truth of it) &s;he appears in heart &s;o innocent, that I confe&s;s to you, Sir, I feel no he&s;itation in re&s;olving to propo&s;e to her, and I tru&s;t I never &s;hall find cau&s;e to blu&s;h at the connection."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is no ground to &s;u&s;pect you ever will,"</Q> &s;aid Henry: <Q REND="inline">"you was her fir&s;t love, my friend, and &s;he, I under&s;tand, was your's: a thief indeed &s;tole in, and made &s;ome pillage of your trea&s;ure, but you your&s;elf had fir&s;t unlocked the che&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's true, that's true,"</Q> quoth Williams colouring; <Q REND="inline">"I owe the debt of honour, and will pay it: yet give me leave to &s;ay, I &s;u&s;pect there will be a &s;ort of blank in her heart for a while to come; but what of that? I mu&s;t tru&s;t to her good &s;en&s;e and my own attentions, to fill it up before long."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And how can you doubt of either,"</Q> re|joined
<PB N="226" REF="230">
Henry?&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I will not doubt,"</Q> replied Williams; <Q REND="inline">"nay, I do not doubt, for &s;he has conducted her&s;elf hitherto in a manner to my perfect &s;atisfaction, and it wou'd be inju&s;tice to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he will fail me in future; never|thele&s;s, if I am not a&s;king too great a fa|vour, and intruding on your kindne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion further than I ought, I confe&s;s it wou'd be a very &s;ingular gratification to me, to know the &s;tate of her mind in the&s;e par|ticulars from your examination and report of it."</Q></P>
<P>To this Henry made an&s;wer, that he &s;aw no rea&s;on to doubt of Su&s;an's &s;incerity, neither was he convinced the method he propo&s;ed of putting it to the te&s;t was altogether advi&s;e|able.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Neverthele&s;s,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"if you are re&s;olv'd to put the probe in my hand, and in&s;i&s;t upon my u&s;ing it, as it is your profe&s;&s;ion to under&s;tand the application, &s;o it mu&s;t be your bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;tand to the effects of it."</Q>&mdash;Williams &s;miled, and replied he would abide by the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The&s;e words were &s;carce out of his mouth, when Su&s;an entered the room; and Williams, glancing a &s;ignificant look at Henry, left them together. A leading kind of conver&s;ation
<PB N="227" REF="231">
was &s;tarted by Henry on the &s;ubject of her little boy under his charge, which he contrived to train towards the point he had in purpo&s;e to di&s;cu&s;s.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I think, Su&s;an,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"as bu&s;ine&s;s will gather upon your hands with the growth of your child, it might not be ami&s;s to look out in good time for &s;ome hone&s;t and well-tempered man to be your partner in the ta&s;k."</Q> Su&s;an blu&s;hed, but at the &s;ame time had a certain arch intelligence in her look, whil&s;t &s;he &s;miled upon him, that gave him to under&s;tand &s;he was aware at whom his in|troduction pointed.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee you are before|hand with me,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"but if I am touching upon an unwelcome topic, tell me &s;o with &s;incerity, and I'll &s;ay no more; but if I am &s;till as much in your confidence as I us'd to be, and you are not di&s;inclin'd to open your mind to your friend, why &s;hou'd we not di&s;cu&s;s this &s;ubject together as naturally as any other? and &s;urely none can be more intere&s;ting and important."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly,"</Q> replied Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"none can be &s;o intere&s;ting to a per&s;on in my circum&s;tances, nor have I any friend on earth, to who&s;e opi|nion I &s;hall attach &s;o much attention and re|&s;pect as to your's: yet I know not how, nor
<PB N="228" REF="232">
ought I perhaps, if I knew how to de&s;cribe the &s;en&s;ation it gives me, to find my&s;elf ad|dre&s;s'd by you on this &s;ubject. In every mat|ter I can lay my heart before you without &s;cruple or re&s;erve, in this only I feel a back|wardne&s;s and repugnance, which ought not to be there, nor &s;hall it be, if my utmo&s;t ef|forts can prevent it; therefore I humbly pray you to proceed, and if I mi&s;behave my&s;elf by any &s;udden weakne&s;s I am not able to con|troul, let me rather meet your pity than incur your di&s;plea&s;ure or contempt."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fear not,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"that you can po&s;&s;ibly be expos'd to either one or the other, nor &s;uffer your&s;elf to believe I have any motives but tho&s;e of the pure&s;t friend&s;hip for pre&s;&s;ing this unwelcome explanation upon you. You and I, Su&s;an, have been in certain &s;ituations, for which I mu&s;t remain your ever|la&s;ting debtor in gratitude, and in the cour&s;e of which the benevolent warmth and &s;en&s;i|bility of your heart have been &s;o far intere&s;ted in my favour, that I feel my&s;elf in &s;uch a de|gree re&s;pon&s;ible for your happine&s;s and &s;ecure e&s;tabli&s;hment in life, as to make it a matter of con&s;cience with me, to &s;ee you &s;ettled and content, before I can enjoy with perfect peace
<PB N="229" REF="233">
of mind the happine&s;s I my&s;elf have &s;o flat|tering a pro&s;pect of. You have known my friend Williams longer than I have, and I need not &s;peak to you of his worth; as little need I &s;ay that he loves you to the length of marrying you."</Q></P>
<P>Here Su&s;an demanded if Williams had &s;aid that voluntarily, and of his own accord, or if Henry had urged him to it, in con&s;equence of any thing that had been talked of in con|fidence between them. To this Henry replied, <Q REND="inline">"I am free to confe&s;s to you, that all I have to tell him he already knows; but as I have had nothing to tell, except what makes for your credit and recommendation, he views your character in its be&s;t and faire&s;t light: a &s;oft &s;ide perhaps towards the tender pa&s;&s;ion he may credit you for, but of me he has no right to be jealous, and for him&s;elf he has no rea|&s;on either to glance at what has pa&s;t, or ap|prehend for what may be to come. A hand|&s;ome fellow at all points as he is, can have nothing to fear from an hone&s;t-hearted girl like you, who&s;e very fir&s;t le&s;&s;on of love was of his teaching."</Q>&mdash;Su&s;an ca&s;t her eyes down, and blu&s;hed. Henry proceeded, <Q REND="inline">"He is now e&s;tab|li&s;h'd in a profe&s;&s;ion, where his diligence and

&s;kill will en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s: what can you better determine upon than to join your means with his, and fix for life with an amiable and worthy man, who has a heart to love you, an under&s;tanding to advi&s;e you, and a &s;pirit that will protect and uphold you under all events of life?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Thank you for your good coun&s;el,"</Q> re|plied Su&s;an, keeping her eyes fixt on the floor; <Q REND="inline">"I have a great opinion of Mr. Williams, but&mdash;"</Q>; here &s;he pau&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"if you are &s;o con|de&s;cending as to be his advocate in this mat|ter, you will advi&s;e him not to talk to me on the &s;ubject for &s;ome two or three days to come."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I under&s;tand you,"</Q> &s;aid Henry; and right|ly judging that a longer pleading would not help his client, ha&s;tened out of the room.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V. Some of the principal Characters in this Hi&s;tory are winding up their Parts.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN our hero had concluded his conference with Su&s;an, he repaired to his father, and had the &s;atisfaction to hear him &s;ay he found him&s;elf &s;o well recovered, that he propo&s;ed, with Williams's permi&s;&s;ion, to ac|cept Sir Roger Man&s;tock's kind invitation, and pay him a vi&s;it the very next day. If our reader has not heard of this invitation, we have his pardon to &s;olicit, as well as that of the ho&s;|pitable Baronet, for our neglect to record it. At the bottom of the &s;tairs, as he came down from his father's room, he was met by old Weevil, who came to return thanks for his kindne&s;s to his &s;on: Tom was now returned home, to the great joy of his family, who con|templated his &s;cars with triumph, and heard his tale with rapture and delight. His father propo&s;ed to him to take on with the trade of the mill, and Sir Roger Man&s;tock had offered to put him into a &s;mall farm, but Tom was a
<PB N="232" REF="236">
lad of an enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit, and in his &s;hort cruize had contracted a pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;ea. The cut in his &s;kull had not cooled the courage at his heart, and a &s;ea-faring life was &s;o decid|edly his choice, that Captain Carey, at the &s;uit of our hero, had promi&s;ed him employment: And as we are now more at lei&s;ure to attend to his particular hi&s;tory than we &s;hall probably be when nearer to the conclu&s;ion of our gene|ral one, we &s;hall take the opportunity of in|forming our readers by anticipation, that Thomas Weevil, through Carey's intere&s;t, ob|tained the lucrative employ of pur&s;er to his frigate; and in the cour&s;e of a &s;ucce&s;sful war|fare, earned enough to provide a comfortable retreat for him&s;elf in time of peace.</P>
<P>Henry's conver&s;ation with the Miller was now cut &s;hort by a more con&s;equential vi&s;itor; his late antagoni&s;t, Captain Crowbery, was in the parlour, and reque&s;ted a few words with him in private. He under&s;tood Mr. Dela|poer had intended his noble relation the ho|nour of a vi&s;it, when he was taken &s;uddenly ill; that his Lord&s;hip was now from home, and in his ab&s;ence he wi&s;hed Mr. Delapoer to be informed, that if the bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;uch as he could execute, or was thought worthy to
<PB N="233" REF="237">
be entru&s;ted with, he &s;hould gladly receive his commands.</P>
<P>Henry made an&s;wer, that from what he un|der&s;tood of Mr. Delapoer's mind on the &s;ub|ject, he had no pre&s;ent wi&s;h of troubling Lord Crowbery or any of the family upon the bu|&s;ine&s;s in que&s;tion; it &s;imply related to a de&s;ign which he had laid a&s;ide: at all events, it did not apply to him, the Captain, and if it &s;hould be taken up afre&s;h, he pre&s;umed Lord Crow|bery would be at home again in a few days. To this the Captain replied, he was &s;orry to &s;ay that was not likely to be the ca&s;e, as he mu&s;t confe&s;s it was not a very honourable way he had taken of terminating a ra&s;h en|gagement, by running away from it: it could not be denied that Mi&s;s Claypole was unfairly treated, for matters had gone great lengths, and now my Lord had taken leave of her in a very abrupt fa&s;hion, by going out of England without any warning, either to her or to her uncle, who accompanied him to town upon the pretence of arranging matters for the marriage: that Mr. Claypole was now come back, hav|ing had a letter put into his hand after his Lord&s;hip's departure, in which he avows his re&s;olution of di&s;charging him&s;elf from his en|gagements
<PB N="234" REF="238">
upon prudential rea&s;ons; and &s;ays he has probably taken leave of England for &s;ome years to come.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have &s;ought occa|&s;ion of telling you this,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e I would fain &s;tand clear in your opinion as to my part in the tran&s;action, which is &s;imply that of being left here in a mo&s;t unplea&s;ant predicament; the neare&s;t relation of a man, who&s;e conduct I cannot approve, but who&s;e intere&s;ts at the &s;ame time I mu&s;t not abandon. My &s;ituation will, I tru&s;t, apologize for this; and I prote&s;t to you, upon my honour, I have not been his Lord&s;hip's advi&s;er in the proceeding. I &s;hould have expected that decency alone would have kept him out of an engagement &s;o un&s;eemly and precipitate. Whil&s;t that affair was carrying on, I was bani&s;h'd from the ca&s;tle, to which I am but ju&s;t recall'd, there to be left in tru&s;t of his concerns, with the di&s;tre&s;sful aggra|vation of being made witne&s;s to a &s;cene, that beggars all de&s;cription. And now, having tre&s;pa&s;s'd on your patience with a detail little intere&s;ting perhaps to you, I have only to add, that if Mr. Delapoer, as your friend, has any thing to propo&s;e within the compa&s;s of my power to gratify him in, I &s;hall be happy in the opportunity of &s;hewing my regard to
<PB N="235" REF="239">
you, by the attention I &s;hall pay to his com|mands."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Captain Crowbery,"</Q> &s;aid our hero, <Q REND="inline">"I am much beholden to you for the kindne&s;s of this offer. The candour with which you mark a conduct, that cannot be ju&s;tified by any prin|ciple of honour, leaves me nothing to add to your comments on that proceeding. I am &s;orry for the lady; but as I &s;u&s;pect no other pa&s;&s;ion but ambition has part in the di&s;ap|pointment, I hope &s;he will the &s;ooner forget it. With regard to her uncle, I am afraid it is not in my heart to find much pity for his mor|tification: in the mean time, Sir, I &s;hall im|part to Mr. Delapoer the very hand&s;ome manner you have expre&s;s'd your&s;elf in to|wards him, and I doubt not but he will be duly &s;en&s;ible of your politene&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;aid, Captain Crowbery took his leave, and in a few minutes after, whil&s;t Henry was &s;itting alone pondering on the&s;e events, to his un&s;peakable &s;urprize, the door was thrown open, and Fanny Claypole her&s;elf, without any previous ceremony, ha&s;tily and wildly bur&s;t into the room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was re&s;olv'd,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;ee you once more for the la&s;t time; and if you have
<PB N="236" REF="240">
any pity in your heart for an injur'd woman, you will not refu&s;e to hear me. That mon&s;ter Crowbery, that murderer of his wife, has a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inated my reputation; but I have found out his hiding-place, and I am &s;etting out this moment in pur&s;uit of him: villain as he is, he &s;hall rue my vengeance. After the mo&s;t &s;educing promi&s;es, the mo&s;t &s;acred vows to marry me, he has fled from his engagements out of England; and before I follow him, per&s;uaded it will never be my fate to &s;ee you more, I cannot go in peace till I have declar'd to you my contrition, and implor'd your for|givene&s;s: Oh! Henry, there is one moment of my life I mu&s;t never cea&s;e to think upon without horror! Thank Heaven you &s;urviv'd it! I was mad and de&s;perate to de&s;troy you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Say no more of it,"</Q> replied our hero, <Q REND="inline">"bani&s;h it from your memory, as I &s;hall bury it in &s;ilence; and be a&s;&s;ur'd I cordially forgive you."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I know,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"you are ca|pable of every thing that is great and noble, and I implore of Heaven to reward you in the arms of the be&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful of her &s;ex, your beloved I&s;abella: I only lov'd you; &s;he loves, approves and de&s;erves you."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have heard,"</Q> re&s;umed he, <Q REND="inline">"how ba&s;ely you have

So far from allowing you ought to regret his flight as a misfortune, it appears to me you &s;hou'd rejoice in it, as an e&s;cape out of the hands of a villain, which, to a lady in your &s;ituation, is a mo&s;t providential re&s;cue."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ah! Henry,"</Q> &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"it is my &s;ituation that makes him a villain, and the wor&s;t of villains; but I repeat to you that I will not be injur'd with impunity; and when you hear of me again, you &s;hall hear I am reveng'd. England I &s;hall never vi&s;it more; and now, before we part for ever, if you are &s;incere in your forgivene&s;s of me, you will hear with favour this my la&s;t reque&s;t. My uncle, poor deluded man, is broken-hearted on his own and my account; he repents from his &s;oul his ingratitude to Sir Roger Man|&s;tock, and his enmity to you; he ju&s;tly de&s;pairs of regaining your lo&s;t opinions; but as he has no where to re&s;ort but to his re&s;idence at Man&s;tock, he ardently &s;olicits your good offices to &s;ecure him &s;uch a reception on his return, as may encourage him to re&s;ume his functions with &s;ome degree of comfort, and not entirely di&s;grace him in the eyes of his
<PB N="238" REF="242">
pari&s;hioners. When I am gone, his &s;ituation will be &s;ad indeed; my indi&s;cretion, and his own ambition, have de&s;troy'd his peace; your benevolence may pre&s;erve him from ab&s;olute de&s;pair. Have you the magnanimity to ex|tend it to him, and return good for ill?&mdash;I am &s;atisfied you have."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"we both are capable of returning good for ill. No one, who ever ta&s;ted that &s;weet tran&s;port, can re|gret the &s;acrifice of &s;uch a direful pa&s;&s;ion as revenge. The virtue of forgivene&s;s is in its own nature &s;o lovely, &s;o congenial to man, that if it had not been pre&s;crib'd to us as a duty, we &s;hou'd have practis'd it as an in|dulgence. When we are in&s;tructed to forgive our enemies, knowing them to be &s;uch, it is a precept, that does not take away our &s;en&s;e of injuries, it only abridges us of the privilege of revenging them; and you, who &s;well with rage again&s;t the wretch that has betray'd you, who threaten to pur&s;ue him with your ven|geance, tell me, is it a plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation you now nouri&s;h in your heart? Would it not be a happy reformation, were it po&s;&s;ible, to change the tempe&s;t into a calm with the word of power? Religion has that power, mercy
<PB N="239" REF="243">
can &s;peak that word; &s;he can breathe peace into your bo&s;om, and purify the heart in which &s;he dwells, till nothing evil can ap|proach it&mdash;mercy is that virtue, which offers opportunity to all; for who is there that has not &s;omething to forgive, although he may have nothing to be&s;tow? 'Tis general as the &s;un; no &s;olitude can exclude its emanation. Ca&s;t me upon a de&s;art coa&s;t, an exile from &s;ociety, where animated nature does not draw the breath of life, &s;till I can find &s;ome object to engage my care; the plant that feebly vegetates for want of &s;oil, the rill that &s;truggles for a clearer channel, will demand my help; and mercy, like heaven's general dew, &s;hall fall upon the naked earth, though not an in&s;ect that has life be pre&s;ent to par|take of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t not hear you on this &s;ubject,"</Q> cried the relentle&s;s dam&s;el; <Q REND="inline">"my nerves are brac'd to the undertaking; my wrongs will not be rea&s;on'd with, my heart pants for revenge; the interce&s;&s;ion of an angel cou'd not &s;hake me from my purpo&s;e.

<P>THE &s;cene la&s;t recorded made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;en&s;ibility of our Henry, that when he returned to Man&s;tock Hou&s;e in the evening, the effect was &s;o di&s;|coverable, that he found it nece&s;&s;ary to im|part to the enquiring I&s;abella what had cau&s;ed it.

Alas! I fear &s;he is de&s;perate enough to execute any dreadful act &s;he meditates; but what is to be done with this poor deluded uncle of her's, whom &s;he recommends to our pity? Methinks it wou'd be hard to refu&s;e him that, now he has &s;een his error, and &s;marts for it &s;o &s;everely.

reflect that &s;he has power to ble&s;s me with a word, and will &s;he not pronounce it?"</Q></P>
<P>He accompanied this appeal with a look &s;o touching, and action &s;o tender, that the fond and unoppo&s;ing I&s;abella was di&s;armed and vanqui&s;hed. The dread of &s;eparation on the one hand, and the impul&s;e of all-powerful love on the other, con&s;pired to &s;econd and enforce his &s;uit. As &s;he meditated upon a reply, her colour came and went, as alternate emotions &s;ucceeded one another: delicacy &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome repelling thoughts; the recent death of Lady Crowbery oppo&s;ed a &s;trong impediment to ha&s;ty mea&s;ures; but then &s;he called to mind two months were yet to pa&s;s before her father would be called from home, and then the &s;ame objections of decorum would not remain in the &s;ame force. She perceived that every hour improved her lover's intere&s;t with Sir Roger, and in two long months there were many hours to mature that intere&s;t, till what was Henry's wi&s;h might be her father's al&s;o, and then her precipitation would not &s;tand in need of an excu&s;e: in &s;hort, the&s;e &s;ame intervening months were &s;uch a re&s;ource in her rea&s;onings upon this petition, and love is &s;o ingenious to

<P>Henry replied to this with &s;uch re&s;pectful, but impre&s;&s;ive tenderne&s;s, and though his heart overflowed with gratitude, he tempered it with &s;uch delicacy, that before their intere&s;ting con|ver&s;ation was concluded, every objection I&s;a|bella's timidity had oppo&s;ed was removed, and her fond heart became &s;o complete a convert to the rhetoric of love, that when they broke up their conference, it would have been hard to decide, could their &s;ecret thoughts have been di&s;covered, which of the two was mo&s;t impatient for the happy moment that was to unite them for life.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII. Occurrences upon a Vi&s;it at Man&s;tock Hou&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning Henry rode over to Crowbery, and found his father pre|paring him&s;elf for his vi&s;it to Sir Roger Man|&s;tock.
<PB N="249" REF="253">
&s;tock. It was a bold experiment, but his heart was &s;o much bent upon the undertaking, that Williams no longer oppo&s;ed it. At the hour appointed Sir Roger's hor&s;es came over, and Delapoer &s;tept gaily into his chai&s;e, after taking a mo&s;t grateful leave of the ho&s;pitable women and hone&s;t Ezekiel, who were a&s;&s;embled on the occa&s;ion, and with many kind wi&s;hes at|tended him to the carriage. The day &s;eemed to &s;mile upon his enterprize, and he arrived at the gates of the venerable man&s;ion with &s;trength and &s;pirits recruited by the fre&s;hne&s;s of the air and the gentle exerci&s;e which the vehicle had given him. On the fir&s;t &s;tep before the door the worthy Baronet received his vi&s;itor, and welcomed him with that ho&s;pitable grace which was peculiarly his own. As he entered the &s;tately hall, through two files of dome&s;tics ranged on each &s;ide, he was &s;truck with a pe|culiar delight, in contemplating a &s;cene that &s;o &s;trongly contra&s;ted every thing his eyes had of late been accu&s;tomed to, and carried his imagination back through centuries pa&s;t to the times of feudal &s;tate and chivalry. He &s;eemed never weary of prai&s;ing and admiring every thing he &s;aw, nor was Sir Roger backward in explaining every object of his curio&s;ity; he
<PB N="250" REF="254">
knew the owners of each &s;hield and cor&s;e|let, had the hi&s;tory of their battles by heart, could point out their portraits in the picture-gallery, and elucidate every banner and bear|ing of the family coat; to all which Delapoer, who was an adept in heraldry, gave a willing and attentive ear.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this di&s;cour&s;e, when Sir Roger had brought down his narrative &s;o near to modern times as to be ju&s;t then engaged in relating an anecdote of his great grandmother, very much to the credit of her beauty, Dela|poer's attention was drawn off by the entrance of I&s;abella, in who&s;e per&s;on he beheld a living model of &s;uch exqui&s;ite perfection, that he could not re&s;i&s;t whi&s;pering to the Baronet, that what|ever might have been the charms of the ance&s;|tor, he was per&s;uaded they were outdone by tho&s;e of the de&s;cendant. Sir Roger &s;miled, and pro|bably was not di&s;plea&s;ed with the apo&s;trophe, though he &s;till &s;eemed unwilling to give up his great grandmother&mdash;murmuring, in an under voice, that he could a&s;&s;ure him Lady Rachel was a famous woman in her time. I&s;abella's manners were of that natural and engaging &s;ort, that all the graces which others gain by &s;tudy, &s;he &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s to a &s;uperior de|gree
<PB N="251" REF="255">
by the gift of nature: how then could &s;he fail to charm a man of Delapoer's &s;en&s;i|bility, who at the &s;ame time recognized in her fine per&s;on a family likene&s;s of that be|loved image which &s;ad remembrance had in|delibly impre&s;&s;ed upon his mind? His figure, though in decay, had &s;till a grace and high|born elegance about it, which neither lap&s;e of years in a debilitating climate, nor the more fatal inroads of corroding melancholy, could &s;o efface, but that there &s;till remained the vene|rable ruin of a noble form. His addre&s;s, though certainly not that of the pre&s;ent aera, was not &s;o &s;tiffened by oriental forms as to be trouble|&s;omely ceremonious; it had all the gallantry and good-breeding of the old court, with &s;ome &s;light tints, perhaps, of its pedantry and pre|ci&s;ion: this, in Sir Roger's eye, was the very model of a fine gentleman, and no in&s;truments in uni&s;on ever harmonized more perfectly than the good ho&s;t and his gue&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir Roger's &s;tile, as we before ob&s;erved, was, in point of open ho&s;pitality, that of the feudal ages, and his return to Man&s;tock brought a great re&s;ort of the neighbouring gentry to his hou&s;e, where the board might literally be &s;aid to groan with plenty; but the mo&s;t inte|re&s;ting
<PB N="252" REF="256">
&s;pectacle to Delapoer was that of the dome&s;tics at their dinner, ranged at three di&s;|tinct tables, according to their gradations and degrees. <Q REND="inline">"This is true magnificence,"</Q> he cried; <Q REND="inline">"this is a princely manner of admi|ni&s;tering a great e&s;tate."</Q> Some venerable per|&s;onages at the head of the garri&s;on particularly &s;truck him; when a grey-headed &s;enior, who pre&s;ided at the upper table, giving a &s;ignal for &s;ilence, ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and lifting a can to his lips, proclaimed aloud, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Pro&s;perity to the hou&s;e of Man&s;tock!</HI>"</Q> which was repeated by all with the like action, and in the like po&s;ture; where|upon, the libation being fini&s;hed, the whole company broke up, and di&s;per&s;ed to their &s;e|veral occupations and employs.</P>
<P>In the great parlour, where Sir Roger en|tertained his gue&s;ts, Delapoer was much amu&s;ed by the &s;eries of family portraits, exhibiting cu|rious &s;pecimens of characters and dre&s;&s;es in the &s;everal fa&s;hions of their times; whil&s;t the Gothic windows of painted gla&s;s reflected variegated gleams of the pri&s;matic colours, which played upon the faces of the company with a &s;ingular and whim&s;ical effect: Zachary Cawdle in par|ticular, who was one at the table, &s;ate directly in the &s;tream of &s;o broad a glare of crim&s;on
<PB N="253" REF="257">
light, that he exhibited a mo&s;t ferocious and re&s;plendent ma&s;k of foil, that would not have di&s;credited the hue of Bacchus him&s;elf in the gaye&s;t of his frolics.</P>
<P>When the ladies had retired, after dinner, &s;omething was &s;aid of Lord Crowbery by a gentleman who &s;ate next to Henry. He might have known it was a topic not very acceptable or polite at Sir Roger's table; and as he &s;eemed going into an account of his attachment to Mi&s;s Claypole, Henry, in a whi&s;per, reminded him that there were &s;ome pre&s;ent who would be thankful to him if he would change the &s;ubject he was upon. The young man was proud, ill-mannered, and irritable; he took Henry's hint as an affront, and turning to him with an indignant look, &s;aid, in a tone that marked his purpo&s;e to be heard by every body round him, <Q REND="inline">"I don't know how I have de|&s;erv'd your reprimand, Sir, nor by what right I am &s;topt in my &s;peech, when I was neither addre&s;&s;ing it to you, nor about to &s;peak di&s;re|&s;pectfully of Lord Crowbery, to whom I have the honour of being related, and for whom I entertain a very high regard and e&s;teem."</Q></P>

and Delapoer had drawn him&s;elf up into a martial attitude, when our hero with the mo&s;t perfect compo&s;ure, not elevating his voice, nor retorting the acrimonious tone in which he had been addre&s;&s;ed, replied, that he was not aware of his connection with Lord Crowbery, but &s;ince that was the ca&s;e, he would compromi&s;e the matter without any further interruption to the company&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"For, if you, Sir,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"will be pleas'd to &s;ay nothing more as to your opinion of his Lord&s;hip, I will be perfectly &s;ilent as to mine."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You will do well, Sir,"</Q> replied Mr. Hard|ham (for that was the name of the &s;peaker) <Q REND="inline">"to be &s;ilent in this and every other com|pany, where that noble Lord is nam'd."</Q>&mdash;Then ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, he &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"With your leave, Sir Roger, we will adjourn to the ladies."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Hold, Sir,"</Q> cried Henry, <Q REND="inline">"we are both at i&s;&s;ue before this good company, and if either of us has receiv'd an in&s;ult, let him that gave it deliver an apology: if there is here one gentleman, that pronounces me in fault, I am in&s;tantly prepar'd to make atonement on the &s;pot."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, no, no!"</Q> was echoed by every voice; and one gentle|man added, that he dare &s;ay Mr. Hardham
<PB N="255" REF="259">
would apologize.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If that is your opinion,"</Q> he replied, <Q REND="inline">"you will be pleas'd to tell me, in the fir&s;t place, for what I am to apologize, and next to whom, for to this moment I never heard what name the gentleman chu&s;es to be addre&s;s'd by."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"By mine,"</Q> replied Dela|poer, <Q REND="inline">"by a name which he inherits as my &s;on, and by which he is intitled to exact &s;atis|faction from any gentleman that has the hardi|ne&s;s to in&s;ult him."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e words were calmly, though pointed|ly delivered; Mr. Hardham pau&s;ed for a few moments, then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mr. De|lapoer, &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am an&s;wer'd; and from what I felt as a relation of Lord Crowbery, can al|low for what you mu&s;t feel as &s;o much nearer allied to this gentleman; to you therefore, as his father, I refer my&s;elf implicitly, and whatever you in your candour think proper to dictate, that I will repeat."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir,"</Q> replied Delapoer, <Q REND="inline">"I can be at no lo&s;s to pronounce; you have already &s;aid enough, and all I have further to wi&s;h for my &s;on is, that he may have the honour and happine&s;s of being better known to you."</Q></P>
<P>Thus, by the timely application of a few patient words, an altercation was put a &s;top
<PB N="256" REF="260">
to, which threatened fatal con&s;equences, for Mr. Hardham was a young man of a very forward &s;pirit, and had more than once been engaged in what are called affairs of honour; he had withal a full &s;en&s;e of his own con&s;e|quence, being a man of great property in the county, &s;on of the lately decea&s;ed member, and the very per&s;on whom his party meant to have &s;et up as candidate, had not Sir Roger met the wi&s;hes of the coalition, and prevented a conte&s;t. His petulance nobody wondered at, for that was habitual to him; how he came to be &s;o right-headed in getting out of the quarrel, was matter of welcome &s;urprize to every body; but there was a latent motive, which operated upon him for curbing his temper in the pre&s;ence of Sir Roger; and it was not &s;o much the firm words of Delapoer, as the fair eyes of I&s;abella, that were the peace|makers on this occa&s;ion: he had watched her during the entertainment; her manners charm|ed him, her beauty enchanted him; but there was &s;omething in her looks at times, that di|rected his &s;u&s;picion towards the per&s;on of our hero; and this, together with a report, that had reached his ears, of an attachment in that quarter, threw a &s;park of jealou&s;y upon the
<PB N="257" REF="261">
combu&s;tibles of his frame, which accounts for the explo&s;ion that &s;o &s;uddenly took place: the event, however, &s;hews that this quarrel|&s;ome gentleman, like others of the like qua|lity, had temper at command, when it &s;uited him to make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Few things could have given greater pain to the ho&s;pitable heart of Sir Roger Man&s;tock, than to have had the peace and good order of &s;ociety di&s;turbed beneath the &s;acred pro|tection of his roof: the harmony that now &s;ucceeded, was of cour&s;e grateful to him above all, and he &s;pared no pains to convince Mr. Hardham of this by repeated marks of the mo&s;t pointed attention. After a few chearful and conciliatory gla&s;&s;es, it was again propo&s;ed to adjourn to the drawing-room: here the pa|cified gentleman had a fair opportunity of re|newing his attentions to the lovely I&s;abella, without any interruption from Henry, now clo&s;eted with his friend Williams, who had galloped over from Crowbery, to impart the glad tidings of his approaching nuptials with his fair betrothed, who had con&s;ented to yield (what alone &s;he had withheld) her hand in marriage on the day but one next en&s;uing. Henry was truly rejoiced at the news, but put
<PB N="258" REF="262">
as much gravity into his features as the feli|city of the occa&s;ion would admit of; all which Williams, who read his thoughts, un|der&s;tood without a comment. Mr. Delapoer was likewi&s;e called into conference, not only for the purpo&s;e of congratulation, but to un|dergo certain medical interrogatories, that Williams had to put to him; all which were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed to the mutual &s;atisfaction of both parties, for nothing was now wanting but gen|tle exerci&s;e and cautious regimen on the pa|tient's part to confirm his recovery, and there|by e&s;tabli&s;h the profe&s;&s;ional fame of the bride|groom elect.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII. A certain Gentleman repeats his Vi&s;it.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Henry returned to the drawing-room, he found nobody there but the father and daughter; the company were all gone, and Mr. Hardham the la&s;t. His atten|tion to I&s;abella had been &s;o marked, that when,
<PB N="259" REF="263">
upon taking leave of Sir Roger, he begged permi&s;&s;ion to wait on him the next morning, upon an affair of con&s;equence, there was little doubt to be made but that it had re&s;pect to I&s;abella. This was conveyed to Sir Roger in a whi&s;per, as he pa&s;&s;ed through the hall to his carriage; and the Baronet had now been im|parting it to his daughter, with his comments upon it to the above effect: her own ob&s;erva|tions al&s;o coincided with the &s;ame idea, and the point was not long in debate what &s;hould be the nature of the an&s;wer to the propo&s;al, if it came; for, independant of all prior engage|ments, Mr. Hardham had not the happy fa|culty of recommending him&s;elf to the good graces of either party: Sir Roger, indeed, ac|knowledged that his preten&s;ions were unex|ceptionable in point of fortune and family, but he thought him of a proud imperious nature; and when he came to reflect upon his beha|viour at table towards Henry, he thought he could di&s;cover other motives for his acquie&s;|cence than what re&s;ulted from pure candour and conviction. I&s;abella &s;aid, &s;he had never found her&s;elf &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed by the attentions of any man in her life, his whole addre&s;s &s;eemed artificially put on to cover a character
<PB N="260" REF="264">
and temper very different from what he a&s;|&s;umed; but of all the per&s;ecutions &s;he ever &s;uffered, by being looked out of countenance, none was to be compared with what his eyes had the faculty of inflicting, when &s;he found them for ever fixt upon her; in &s;hort, throw|ing all compari&s;ons out of the que&s;tion, Mr. Hardham was po&s;itively, in her opinion, the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant man &s;he had ever met with.</P>
<P>In this period of their di&s;cour&s;e Henry en|tered the room; and related what had pa&s;&s;ed between him and Williams. A new &s;ubject was now &s;tarted, and of a plea&s;anter nature: Henry &s;poke in the highe&s;t terms of Williams, and as his father was now retired to his cham|ber for the night, he gave an account of all he had done for Williams, and how he had adju&s;ted matters with Zachary on his behalf, by which he had &s;et him out clear in the world, with a fair pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s in his profe&s;&s;ion, and of a happy connection with the girl of his heart, now comfortably e&s;tabli&s;hed. I&s;abella a&s;ked if he was fully appri&s;ed of Su|&s;an's hi&s;tory. Henry a&s;&s;ured her, he was acquainted with every particular of it, and had little difficulty in reconciling him&s;elf to cir|cum&s;tances, more imputable to ill-treatment
<PB N="261" REF="265">
than mi&s;conduct.&mdash;"And was Su&s;an very rea|dily con&s;enting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">  march? had &s;he no &s;ru|ples to overc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> wholly and &s;olely attach'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;miled, and turning to Sir <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> appealed to the court if the&s;e were que&s;tions he was bound to an&s;wer.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I can under&s;tand,"</Q> replied the worthy magi&s;trate, <Q REND="inline">"that they are que&s;tions you wi&s;h to evade; however, as Su&s;an was her own mi&s;tre&s;s, and under no controul, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e &s;he had good rea&s;ons for the choice &s;he has made; and I think I&s;abella her&s;elf will allow that is a fair conclu&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Hardham was mentioned, and Henry, in a kind of whi&s;per, a&s;ked Sir Roger if he did not think it wou'd be right for him to pay that gentleman the compliment of a vi&s;it the next morning. Sir Roger an&s;wered that he &s;hould have thought &s;o, but that Mr. Hard|ham had &s;ignified his intention of coming over to Man&s;tock; and if he conjectured rightly of his bu&s;ine&s;s, the ceremony of a vi&s;it might very well be di&s;pen&s;ed with. Henry took the hint, ca&s;t a tender look upon I&s;abella's blu&s;hing countenance, and immediately gave a turn to the conver&s;ation, by &s;peaking of Mr. Claypole: he had been with him that morn|ing,
<PB N="262" REF="266">
and found him in great affliction, on ac|count of a letter he had received from his niece, by which it appeared &s;he had taken the de&s;perate re&s;olution, of pur&s;uing her ba&s;e deceiver out of England, and was then on the point of embarking in a pacquet for that pur|po&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"Is the girl mad,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"to run after a ra&s;cal that any other woman wou'd think her&s;elf happy to be rid of? what can &s;he propo&s;e to gain by &s;uch a crazy expedi|tion?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Revenge,"</Q> cried Henry, <Q REND="inline">"if I am to believe her own profe&s;&s;ions; and if I may judge from the frantic menaces &s;he vented again&s;t him, when &s;he &s;urpriz'd me with a vi&s;it at Su&s;an May's, I wou'd not en&s;ure his Lord&s;hip's ribs from a &s;tiletto, if once he falls within her reach."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"A wretched cata&s;trophe truly,"</Q> cried Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"that wou'd be, but a &s;triking moral for tyrants: Mr. Hardham will then have to mourn the lo&s;s of his re|&s;pected friend and relation, and this mi&s;guided this unhappy man, poor Claypole, will bring his politics to a mi&s;erable end; 'tis ever thus with over-cunning men."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But he has thoroughly repented of his ingratitude,"</Q> &s;aid I&s;abella, <Q REND="inline">"and is now a real object for your pity and forgivene&s;s."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He is welcome to
<PB N="263" REF="267">
them both,"</Q> rejoined Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"and to every thing that I can &s;ub&s;cribe to his con&s;o|lation and relief; but what I cannot com|mand, my affection and e&s;teem, them I have not in my power to be&s;tow; when once in|gratitude has chill'd the heart that glow'd with friend&s;hip, who can kindle it afre&s;h? I &s;peak &s;trongly and explicitly to you, my dear chil|dren, upon this &s;ubject, becau&s;e I know that both Henry upon this occa&s;ion, and you, I&s;a|bella, upon others as well as this, have pur|po&s;ely introduc'd it with a kind de&s;ign of re|in&s;tating Claypole in my good opinion, by &s;etting forth his &s;ufferings and contrition: the attempt does honour to your hearts; 'tis amiable in the extreme, and I rejoice that you are capable of being advocates for one, that was no advocate for you, but artfully abus'd my confidence, and turn'd what intere&s;t he had in me (and that I own was not a little) in&s;idiou&s;ly again&s;t you both. Baffled in this project, and di&s;appointed of his malice, he betook him&s;elf to a wretch, who&s;e very name is poi&s;on to my ears, and there began an in|famous cabal, which having ended in mi&s;|carriage and di&s;grace, he now repents of; but remember, children, it is repentance after pu|ni&s;hment,
<PB N="264" REF="268">
and therefore, when I &s;ay that I forgive him, I have &s;aid enough;&mdash;I have no|thing more to do with Mr. Claypole."</Q></P>
<P>To this no an&s;wer was attempted, and pro|bably from this time till certain circum&s;tances, hereafter recorded, came to light, neither Hen|ry nor I&s;abella felt in them&s;elves any di&s;po&s;i|tion to revive the &s;ubject. Claypole in the mean time kept him&s;elf retired from all &s;o|ciety, except when Henry occa&s;ionally paid him a charitable vi&s;it, or Sir Roger cheared him with a civil word, which every Sunday he took care to addre&s;s to him after divine &s;ervice, in the &s;ight of the congregation.</P>
<P>The next morning came, and Sir Roger was ob&s;erved to be more than ordinarily thoughtful during breakfa&s;t: his mind was oc|cupied with the expectation of his unwelcome vi&s;itor. When he reflected upon what had fal|len from him at table, where he was interrupt|ed by Henry, he called to mind &s;o many unplea&s;ant marks of a purpo&s;ed affront, &s;o much arrogance in his manner, and &s;uch in|dications of a &s;uppre&s;&s;ed re&s;entment, even in the very act of atoning for his in&s;ult, that he was not without &s;u&s;picion that the flame of his temper would find &s;ome other vent, if
<PB N="265" REF="269">
upon the pre&s;umption of his propo&s;ing for Mi&s;s Man&s;tock, he was to meet him with an in&s;tant and abrupt refu&s;al. On this account he was not a little perplexed how to deport him&s;elf in the conference, &s;o as neither to ir|ritate him again&s;t Henry as a rival, nor en|courage him to con&s;ider I&s;abella as a lady he was warranted to pur&s;ue with his addre&s;&s;es; and the whole re&s;ult of Sir Roger's medita|tions amounted only to this, that he had a clearer &s;ight of his difficulty than of the way to lead him out of it. It was therefore not a little to be regretted, that before he had gained any di&s;tinct perception of the line he was to follow, Mr. Hardham was announced, and of cour&s;e immediately admitted to a private con|ference.</P>
<P>Mr. Hardham prefaced his more material bu&s;ine&s;s, by apologizing for words that had e&s;caped from him ye&s;terday, in the heat of conver&s;ation, which, as far as they alluded to Lord Crowbery, he feared might have con|veyed an impre&s;&s;ion in his disfavour, as &s;eem|ing to imply that he approved of his Lord|&s;hip's conduct in general, when in fact he only alluded to that part of his character, which was uppermo&s;t in his thoughts, the &s;teady &s;up|port
<PB N="266" REF="270">
which he had always given to the county intere&s;ts of his family: that he was not then appri&s;ed of the ju&s;t rea&s;ons Sir Roger had to re&s;ent his treatment of an amiable lady, un|fortunately lo&s;t to the world; neither was he informed of the late di&s;graceful &s;tep he had taken, of flying from engagements, which though ra&s;hly made could not be honourably abandoned;&mdash;the&s;e circum&s;tances, he confe&s;&s;ed, had been candidly explained to him that very morning by Captain Crowbery; and it was but fair to &s;ay, that upon that &s;tatement he felt him&s;elf obliged to give up his noble re|lation as indefen&s;ible on both accounts; and this he hoped would &s;uffice to &s;et him &s;trait in Sir Roger's good opinion, if he had un|fortunately endangered it from any thing he had inadvertently been led to &s;ay the day be|fore.&mdash;Here he came to a &s;top, and &s;eemed to expect &s;ome an&s;wer from Sir Roger.</P>
<P>Sir Roger replied, that it was a point with him to enter into no di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of Lord Crow|bery's conduct, e&s;pecially with Lord Crow|bery's relations: his niece was dead, and what|ever were her &s;ufferings in this life, they were now at an end: as to Mi&s;s Claypole's ca&s;e, he had nothing to do with it; it was a &s;tory he
<PB N="267" REF="271">
did not wi&s;h to lend his ear to; in like man|ner he begged leave to &s;ay, that with re&s;pect to any opinions Mr. Hardham might adopt, in favour or disfavour of the Lord in que&s;tion, he hoped he under&s;tood him&s;elf too well to interfere in any &s;hape with them, much le&s;s was he di&s;po&s;ed to revive the mention of a trifling altercation, which was &s;o completely done away to the honour of both parties, and for that rea&s;on &s;hould be buried in perpetual oblivion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then if I may indulge the hope,"</Q> he re|joined, <Q REND="inline">"that my conde&s;cen&s;ion in accommo|dating my&s;elf to the gentleman's vivacity was acceptable to Sir Roger Man&s;tock, let me pre&s;ume to draw one obvious conclu&s;ion from it, and take for granted that he under&s;tood the &s;acrifice to have been, what it truly was, a mark of my re&s;pect to him, and an ambition &s;o to recommend my&s;elf to his opinion, as to ground &s;ome title to his favour and protec|tion in a &s;uit which I have now to make, and on the i&s;&s;ue of which the happine&s;s of my whole life depends."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Hardham pau&s;ed for a reply, but none being made, he proceeded to explain:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I flatter my&s;elf I need not dwell upon particu|lars
<PB N="268" REF="272">
&s;o much within your knowledge, as my family or fortune; they are &s;uch, I tru&s;t, as will entitle me to credit, when I a&s;&s;ert that neither intere&s;t nor ambition have any &s;hare in the &s;incere and pure attachment which I profe&s;s to have for your mo&s;t amiable daughter: no, Sir, it is by the heart alone I am attracted to Mi&s;s Man&s;tock; and as I hope my cha|racter may boldly face the light, and never need the veil of my&s;tery, I hold it fair and honourable to appri&s;e you of my wi&s;hes, and reque&s;t your &s;anction to the tender of my mo&s;t humble addre&s;&s;es to your lovely daughter."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Roger pau&s;ed a while; and then with much gravity, and in a deliberate tone, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Your preten&s;ions, Mr. Hardham, in point of fortune and family, are, as you &s;ay, too well known to &s;tand in need of any explanation; they are &s;uch as qualify you to propo&s;e for any lady in this kingdom; and certainly, Sir, in the attachment you profe&s;s for my daugh|ter I have every rea&s;on to believe you guided by no other motives than tho&s;e of free choice, and di&s;intere&s;ted inclination. When, therefore, you appeal to me, that I wou'd &s;anction the tender of your addre&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s Man&s;tock, (I believe I u&s;e your own expre&s;&s;ion) I can have
<PB N="269" REF="273">
but one an&s;wer to make, &s;o long as your re|ference is confined to but one point, and that &s;imply to demand a pa&s;&s;port to my daughter: no father, I believe, whatever may be his views for his child, will refu&s;e that to Mr. Hardham."</Q></P>
<P>To this he replied, <Q REND="inline">"If I have explain'd no further to you on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, Sir, I hope you will con&s;ider it as a very na|tural wi&s;h on my part to owe my &s;ucce&s;s, if I am &s;o ble&s;t as to obtain it, wholly and &s;olely to my own intere&s;t in the lady's good opinion, who is to con&s;titute my happine&s;s; and as I cannot doubt but Mi&s;s Man&s;tock is incapable of conde&s;cending to be&s;tow her regards on any man of dubious character, or ju&s;t emerg'd from meanne&s;s and ob&s;curity, I tru&s;t, if I am permitted to approach her, I &s;hall at lea&s;t not have to combat with a heart pre-occupied by any rival, or, if by any, not by one that will di&s;grace her preference, and make me feel my&s;elf degraded by the com|petition."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As you put no que&s;tion to me in the mat|ter,"</Q> replied the Baronet briefly and coldly, <Q REND="inline">"I am not put to any an&s;wer.&mdash;You have free acce&s;s to Mi&s;s Man&s;tock."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="274">This brought the proud &s;uitor to a pau&s;e: he perceived he had gone too far, and carried his language too high; and he &s;aw him&s;elf in the nece&s;&s;ity of qualifying what he had &s;aid with an apology, or throwing up the negotiation at once: <Q REND="inline">"I am afraid,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"that I have expre&s;s'd my&s;elf too warmly and unwarily; but I entreat Sir Roger Man&s;tock will be a&s;&s;ur'd, that I entertain a mo&s;t profound re&s;pect for his per&s;on and character, and if I &s;par'd to &s;o|licit his good favour and protection to my &s;uit, it was &s;olely dictated by an ambition, which I hope will be thought both natural and com|mendable."</Q></P>
<P>Here he turned his eyes upon Sir Roger;&mdash;a &s;ilent bow was all the an&s;wer he obtained.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I perceive,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"I am unfortu|nate in my manner, and deficient perhaps in &s;omething, which in the character of a peti|tioner I ought to carry about with me; but I am new in the predicament, and having failed to conciliate the father's favour, I will not chu&s;e &s;o unlucky a moment for reque&s;ting an audience of the daughter. I am not quite prepar'd to receive two rebuffs in the &s;ame breach."</Q>&mdash;With the&s;e words he quitted his &s;eat, and Sir Roger ri&s;ing at the &s;ame mo|ment,
<PB N="271" REF="275">
they took a &s;ilent leave, and Mr. Hard|ham mounted his curricle in waiting, highly out of humour with his reception, his proud heart &s;welling with vexation to find his &s;elf-importance humbled; and prepared to vent his &s;pite upon two unoffending hor&s;es, who&s;e tender &s;kins &s;oon &s;marted under the cea&s;e|le&s;s la&s;h of their unfeeling tyrant.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX. Why is Earth and A&s;hes proud?</HEAD>
<P>MR. Hardham, in&s;tead of returning to his own hou&s;e, drove to Crowbery Ca&s;tle, to make report to his friend the Captain, and con&s;ult him upon the po&s;ture of affairs at Man&s;tock. The advice he got here was on the whole very prudent, but he was not ju&s;t then in the be&s;t temper to receive it. Captain Crowbery, as we have before ob&s;erved, enter|tained a very high opinion of Henry, and ever &s;ince his rencontre with him had taken all occa&s;ions of doing ju&s;tice to his behaviour, not only in that affair, but in every other that had come to his knowledge, particularly as to the &s;hare he had in Carey's action with the frigate.

contemptuou&s;ly of him as a rival, and &s;eemed to reproach him&s;elf for having &s;tooped to any apology, Crowbery plainly told him that he could by no means be a party in any &s;teps for grafting a &s;erious quarrel on a &s;illy altercation, that had been once fairly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed: for his own part, he had been already flagrantly in the wrong towards Henry, and had turned out with him in con&s;equence of it; it mu&s;t then be a very &s;trong ca&s;e indeed that would call him out again, either as principal or &s;econd.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And was it not a &s;trong ca&s;e,"</Q> Hardham demanded, <Q REND="inline">"when the character of Lord Crowbery was glanc'd at in &s;uch pointed terms, and in a public company, by a fellow who had no right to u&s;e his name, in any place or on any occa&s;ion, but with deference and re&s;pect?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I thought,"</Q> replied Crowbery, <Q REND="inline">"that I had open'd enough to you in our morning's conver&s;ation on this &s;ubject to ju&s;tify the words that Henry us'd, had they been even &s;tronger than you &s;tate them. I can now truly &s;ay, that if you and I, as relations of that unhappy man, have any ground left us to &s;tand upon in his defence, we owe it to the candour of the very per&s;on you complain of. The melancholy news I receiv'd this day, led me to turn &s;ome

papers over, which, at Blachford's death, were honourably deliver'd up by Henry, that in &s;ome hands wou'd have been arms no mortal cou'd have parried. If he open'd them, we are at the mercy of his honour for keeping them &s;ecret; if he return'd them unexamin'd, we are indebted to his delicacy for our po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. You may believe me, Mr. Hardham, that tho&s;e papers, which I have now de&s;troy'd, wou'd have brought to light very dark dealings, and made the title, that has now by a mo&s;t dreadful accident devolv'd on me, a title of di&s;grace and &s;hame."</Q></P>
<P>Hardham eagerly demanded what accident he alluded to?&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The death of Lord Crow|bery,"</Q> he replied. His Lord&s;hip had landed at O&s;tend, and, from the po&s;ition of the armies, had been &s;topt there for &s;ome days; in the mean time, a villain found means to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him in the &s;treets, as he was coming home late at night to his hotel: he was taken up by the patrole, mortally &s;tabbed, and incapable of giving any account of what had pa&s;&s;ed. Every means had been taken by the commandant for di&s;covering the murderer, but hitherto without &s;ucce&s;s, he had &s;trong &s;u&s;picions in his mind, which pointed to a certain per&s;on, who had
<PB N="275" REF="279">
clo&s;ely followed him out of England, but the&s;e he would not make public, being determined to &s;et out the next morning, and pur&s;ue his enquiries on the &s;pot.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am &s;hock'd,"</Q> re|plied Hardham, <Q REND="inline">"at the account; and whil&s;t I congratulate your Lord&s;hip on your acce&s;&s;ion to the title of your family, I mu&s;t deplore the cata&s;trophe, that has devolv'd it upon you under circum&s;tances of &s;o melancholy a ca&s;t.

There is nothing lies &s;o heavy on my heart as the treatment they have met with from the unfor|tunate deceas'd; I am the la&s;t man living that &s;hou'd &s;peak too har&s;hly of Lord Crowbery, my benefactor, but I have been made a pain|ful witne&s;s to &s;uch things, as make me &s;hudder to reflect upon.

<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> cried Henry, ri&s;ing from his chair, and taking his hand, <Q REND="inline">"I thank you; you have ju&s;tified the high opinion I conceiv'd of you, and have greatly honour'd me by this commi&s;&s;ion."</Q>&mdash;Here he &s;topt, for his voice faultered; and glancing his eyes upon a picture of his mother, over the chimney, which gave a &s;triking character of her in youth and beauty, nature forced her way, and putting his hand|kerchief to his eyes, he yielded to the irre|&s;i&s;tible emotion, and &s;aid no more.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We will adjourn to the library,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Crowbery; <Q REND="inline">"where a friend of mine is wait|ing, who wi&s;hes to pay his compliments to you. Suffer me only to a&s;k you, before you go, if you think that picture will be an ac|ceptable

Lord Crowbery then informed him who the per&s;on was that expected him in the library; and, after a few words introduc|tory to their meeting, took him by the hand, and u&s;hered him to Mr. Hardham, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to each in turn with many civil &s;peeches and profe&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem, hoping it might be his good fortune, as common friend to both, to bring forward &s;uch an explanation as might have no grounds for future mi&s;under&s;tanding on the part of either. Mr. Hardham &s;aid, he tru&s;ted the gentleman could not doubt his readine&s;s to do away affronts, whether ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly taken up; and he pre&s;umed it was no &s;mall proof of his continuing in the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition, that he had waited his lei&s;ure for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of paying him his compli|ments in Lord Crowbery's pre&s;ence. Henry,
<PB N="281" REF="285">
on his part, a&s;&s;ured him, that he had devoted that morning to the honour of paying him a vi&s;it at his own hou&s;e, but had been told he would be from home. He hoped Mr. Hard|ham had carried with him no impre&s;&s;ions from their la&s;t meeting that made a &s;econd explana|tion nece&s;&s;ary, re&s;pecting any thing which had there occurred; if it was &s;o, he was perfectly ready on his part to renew the a&s;&s;urances he had then given him of his entire acquie&s;cence in the manner he had taken for terminating that trivial di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Here the Lord Crowbery interpo&s;ed; he hoped there was no intention on either &s;ide of look|ing back to what was pa&s;t, but, on the con|trary, by looking forward, to prevent occa&s;ion of di&s;putes in future: <Q REND="inline">"And this,"</Q> he added, <Q REND="inline">"may be ea&s;ily effected where two men of honour meet, mutually di&s;pos'd to deal can|didly with each other, &s;hou'd they find them|&s;elves competitors in the &s;ame pur&s;uit."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I do not quite pledge my&s;elf to that,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Hardham; <Q REND="inline">"as I wou'd not choo&s;e to engage in any pur&s;uit where I did not &s;ee my&s;elf either fairly pitted again&s;t any that might oppo&s;e me, or well a&s;&s;ured of &s;urmounting competition. Much as I re&s;pect Mi&s;s Man&s;tock, I have no
<PB N="282" REF="286">
ambition to be pointed at as her di&s;carded &s;uitor; and great as my opinion may be of Mr. Delapoer's extraordinary merits, I mu&s;t own I do not covet the honour of being known as his rival in a &s;truggle for that lady's favour, if he has already &s;ecur'd her affections, and been approv'd of by Sir Roger as his &s;on-in-law."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And does Mr. Hardham expect,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"that I &s;hou'd account to him for my proceedings, having no de&s;ire to make enquiries into his? Wou'd it become me to &s;peak out of Sir Roger Man&s;tock's family of what I know or believe to be pa&s;&s;ing in it? That I will never do; the&s;e lips &s;hall never pre&s;umptuou&s;ly profane the name of Mi&s;s Man|&s;tock, nor will I &s;uffer any others &s;o to do in my hearing with impunity."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then I mu&s;t take the liberty to tell you&mdash;"</Q> &s;aid Hardham; and was proceeding, when Lord Crowbery, putting his hand upon his brea&s;t, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Stop, I conjure you, Sir, if it be only for my &s;ake, and let us argue calmly, or di&s;|mi&s;s the &s;ubject. I was the promoter of this interview, and am pledg'd for the i&s;&s;ue of it. Cou'd I have &s;uppos'd that you, my friend and relation, wou'd have expre&s;s'd your&s;elf in
<PB N="283" REF="287">
a &s;tile &s;o lofty and &s;o irritating, I wou'd as &s;oon have burnt this hou&s;e over my head as &s;uffer'd it to have been made a &s;cene of quarrel and contention. What Mr. Delapoer has &s;aid is not one word too much for the occa&s;ion that gave ri&s;e to it. How el&s;e cou'd you expect a man of honour to reply to &s;uch a &s;peech, in which you &s;eem'd to make your own &s;elf-con&s;equence your whole concern? Methinks, of all men living, Mr. Hardham, you &s;hou'd keep a guard upon your&s;elf, and, being &s;o quick to feel in your own per&s;on, &s;hou'd be cautious how you wound the feelings of others. I &s;peak plainly, Sir, but I have the rights of ho&s;pitality to protect; and if you are offended with me for it, I mu&s;t meet the con&s;equences."</Q></P>
<P>All this while Hardham &s;ate with a con|temptuous &s;mile upon his countenance, af|fecting to receive every reproach as a com|pliment, bowing with an air of counterfeited re&s;pect; when perceiving that Lord Crowbery had concluded, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"I am infinitely oblig'd to you, my Lord, for your extraordi|nary politene&s;s, and &s;hall endeavour to con|vince you that I have not lo&s;t one word of your edifying lecture, by the early opportunity I &s;hall take of reque&s;ting you to hear the com|ments

I have made upon it."</Q>&mdash;Lord Crow|bery with quickne&s;s replied, <Q REND="inline">"U&s;e your own plea&s;ure, Sir; I &s;hall be at home for the day: when you are ready with your comments, I &s;hall expect you; and for &s;ecurity's &s;ake you may bring a prompter with you."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"LET him go,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Crowbery, as Hardham bounced out of the room; <Q REND="inline">"he has the pride of Lucifer."</Q>&mdash;Henry ex|pre&s;&s;ed great unea&s;ine&s;s at what had pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;trongly contended that the affair was his own. This Lord Crowbery would not admit, nor did he look to be farther troubled with his angry cou&s;in; he had had many &s;uch &s;parrings with him, which had pa&s;&s;ed off as he &s;uppo&s;ed this would, for he never &s;pared him when he was in that vaunting &s;tile; how|ever, if he &s;hould chance to be ju&s;t then in one of his fighting fits (for his courage came

by &s;tarts, though his petulance was con&s;titu|tional) it would not, he owned, be ami&s;s to be ready for him.</P>
<P>Henry hoped he would have no farther trouble with him, felt great re&s;pon&s;ibility for the con&s;equences, and would hold him&s;elf at his call, either in his Lord&s;hip's hou&s;e or at Williams the &s;urgeon's, &s;o long as there was any chance of his &s;ervices being wanted.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I will intrude upon you no longer than for two hours of your time,"</Q> he replied; <Q REND="inline">"within which, if our angry gentleman does not make his appearance, I &s;hall think no more of him; if in that interval you can amu&s;e your&s;elf in this library, or pre|fer going to Mr. Williams, I will overhawl my artillery in the interim, and put my hand to a few papers not quite &s;o convenient to be left at the i&s;&s;ue of chance and accident."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;aid, they parted, Henry taking his cour&s;e to his friend Su&s;an's, where he found Williams and his betrothed, this being the eve of their wedding-day: here he took the fir&s;t opportunity of telling Williams, in a whi&s;per, the probability there was of an affair taking place, where his attendance would be mo&s;t acceptable, which he readily engaged for; he then, with as much gaiety as he could a&s;&s;ume,

made his congratulations to Su&s;an; and whil&s;t this di&s;cour&s;e was going on, as he &s;tood by the window, Sir Roger Man&s;tock's chai&s;e was dis|covered coming acro&s;s the green, and making directly for the hou&s;e. It was quickly at the door, when he heard him&s;elf joyfully greeted by his beloved I&s;abella, who was &s;eated at the &s;ide of her father. They quitted the carriage, and after a mo&s;t re&s;pectful welcome on the part of Su&s;an, Williams having mode&s;tly re|tired, they were at their own reque&s;t left in private with our hero.</P>
<P>Sir Roger opened the bu&s;ine&s;s, by informing him of Mr. Hardham's propo&s;al, and the anxiety thereby occa&s;ioned not only to I&s;abella, but him&s;elf, from the known impetuo&s;ity of that haughty &s;uitor's temper, and the dread he had of con&s;equences thence re&s;ulting: he would not di&s;gui&s;e from Henry that his &s;udden di&s;appearance that morning, &s;o quickly follow|ing Hardham's un&s;ucce&s;&s;ful vi&s;it, had &s;o alarm|ed his daughter, that at her de&s;ire he had come over thither with her, in hopes of find|ing him, as fortunately they had done.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I let you into this &s;ecret,"</Q> &s;aid he, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"though I&s;abella is here pre&s;ent, and hears her&s;elf betrayed by me, becau&s;e, to &s;ay the

<P>Henry, who was &s;eated between them, took the hand of each, and pre&s;&s;ed it to his heart in &s;peechle&s;s ec&s;tacy. I&s;abella, &s;uffu&s;ed with blu&s;hes of the deepe&s;t dye, and not venturing to rai&s;e her mode&s;t eyes, which &s;en&s;ibility had filled with tears, kept &s;till &s;ilence, which was not interrupted till Sir Roger, re&s;uming his di&s;cour&s;e, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Henry, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Now if you are que&s;tion'd by that haughty interloper, tell him you have my au|thority to &s;ay that I&s;abella Man&s;tock is&mdash;(what &s;hall I bid you &s;ay?) tell him at once, and &s;top his importunity&mdash;&s;he is your wife.&mdash;Now a&s;k her if I've &s;aid a &s;yllable too much."</Q></P>

<P>After a proper portion of time had been devoted to joy and gratitude on the part of
<PB N="288" REF="292">
our hero, Sir Roger began to comment on the circum&s;tances of Lord Crowbery's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation. The deed was horrid, the &s;u&s;picions it involved afflicting, but the removal of &s;uch a worthle&s;s being out of life was providential; he had &s;een that unhappy man, the uncle of a de&s;perate creature, &s;tained, as he greatly feared, with the blood of the decea&s;ed; he comforted him as well as he could, yet he perceived his mind was immer&s;ed in deep de&s;pair and me|lancholy.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Whether he is inform'd,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"of any circum&s;tances that fix the guilt upon his niece, I forbore to enquire, but I &s;hou'd fear he knows more than he thinks proper to reveal."</Q>&mdash;Henry perceived that Clay|pole had been le&s;s communicative to Sir Roger than to him, for he had actually ex|hibited to him in confidence a letter under his niece's hand, exulting in the completion of her revenge, and boa&s;ting that &s;he had found a hand to puni&s;h perfidy; a Frenchman who had been lurking about London for evil pur|po&s;es, and had been warned out of England, took his pa&s;&s;age in the &s;ame pacquet with her to O&s;tend; &s;he &s;ounded him, and found him the fitte&s;t agent for her de&s;perate purpo&s;e, being deep in all the ma&s;&s;acres that had deluged Paris
<PB N="289" REF="293">
with human blood: he had made good his e&s;cape, and was &s;afe among&s;t his brother <HI>&s;ans|culottes</HI>; for her part &s;he defied pur&s;uit; &s;he had lodged her&s;elf where no &s;earch could fol|low her;&mdash;let her uncle therefore &s;et his mind at re&s;t, &s;he &s;hould never be heard of more, and bade him everla&s;tingly farewell.</P>
<P>Time had imperceptibly &s;lipt away during this conver&s;ation, and Sir Roger had ju&s;t re|collected to order his chai&s;e, when Williams came into the room, and whi&s;pered Henry that Lord Crowbery expected him at the ca&s;tle; in &s;pite of all his &s;elf-command, he changed colour at the &s;ummons, and I&s;abella in&s;tantly caught alarm. Honour demanded in&s;tant obedience to the call, yet Henry's in|genuity could hardly &s;ugge&s;t an excu&s;e &s;ufficient to bear him out; the be&s;t apology he could devi&s;e upon the &s;udden was, that Lord Crowbery being on the point of &s;etting out for O&s;tend, and under&s;tanding he had had an interview with Fanny Claypole ju&s;t before her leaving Crowbery, had reque&s;ted him to come to him without delay.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Tell me only,"</Q> &s;aid I&s;abella, <Q REND="inline">"that you are not going to meet that hateful Hardham, and I &s;hall be at peace."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have nothing to &s;ay to Mr. Hardham,"</Q> replied

Henry; <Q REND="inline">"and I conjure you not to think about him."</Q>&mdash;So &s;aying, he hurried out of the room, and bidding Williams follow him as fa&s;t as he could, made the be&s;t of his way to the place of a&s;&s;ignation.</P>
<P>I&s;abella's apprehen&s;ions were by no means quieted, for his agitated looks and impatient motions augured &s;omething on his mind more important and more pre&s;&s;ing than the cau&s;e he had a&s;&s;igned. She ran to Su&s;an May, and a&s;ked for Williams.&mdash;He was gone with Henry.&mdash;This was a circum&s;tance to aggravate her terrors: duels and wounds immediately oc|curred; why el&s;e &s;hould he take a &s;urgeon with him? Even Sir Roger's equanimity was not proof again&s;t this. At one time he would go to the ca&s;tle him&s;elf;&mdash;this I&s;abella would not hear of&mdash;he would &s;end a &s;ervant to &s;py what was going forward&mdash;he would contrive a me&s;&s;age to Lord Crowbery him&s;elf;&mdash;he could neither reconcile his mind to the one, nor invent the other. The chai&s;e was at the door, but I&s;abella could not &s;tir from the &s;pot, her fears had rooted her; and Dame May, who fore&s;aw there would be a demand upon her clo&s;et, was bu&s;ied in providing re&s;ources again&s;t faintings and hy&s;terics: Su&s;an &s;trove to
<PB N="291" REF="295">
admini&s;ter the con&s;olation of rea&s;on; but no &s;ooner did the apprehen&s;ion of Henry's danger &s;eize her fancy, than &s;he cea&s;ed to rea&s;on again&s;t imaginary fears, and, by &s;ub&s;cribing her own to I&s;abella's, aggravated both.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this confu&s;ion, Zachary Cawdle came into the hou&s;e. A new-comer in &s;uch &s;ituations, let him come from whence he will, gives a &s;pring to curio&s;ity, and awakens hope.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Did he know if Mr. Hardham was at the ca&s;tle?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He &s;aw him pa&s;s his door towards Lord Crowbery's not many minutes ago."</Q>&mdash;It was the &s;entence of temporary death to I&s;abella: &s;he fell back in her chair pale as a&s;hes.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Hell and confu&s;ion!"</Q> exclaimed Zachary, <Q REND="inline">"what devil has bewitch'd my tongue, that it &s;hou'd &s;tumble on this mi&s;|chief?"</Q>&mdash;He then be&s;tirred him&s;elf to retrieve the damage he had done, and Dame May was di&s;patched for the requi&s;ites, whil&s;t the father &s;tood motionle&s;s and agha&s;t. Zachary had his fingers on her pul&s;e:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Courage! worthy Sir,"</Q> he cried; <Q REND="inline">"the defection is pa&s;|&s;ing off; the pul&s;ation of the artery is per|ceptible; we begin to revive."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"God be prais'd!"</Q> exclaim'd the father, in a tran&s;port&mdash;When, in the &s;ame in&s;tant, a voice was heard
<PB N="292" REF="296">
from without, calling aloud upon Doctor Cawdle, and in a few moments after, Su&s;an, who had run out upon enquiry, came back with the joyful tidings that Henry was per|fectly &s;afe: Zachary's a&s;&s;i&s;tance was wanted for Mr. Hardham, who was &s;hot by Lord Crowbery in a duel.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Jump into my chai&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"and bid them drive to the wounded man's relief as fa&s;t as they can gal|lop."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Fair and &s;oftly, worthy Sir,"</Q> quoth Zachary; <Q REND="inline">"I can neither jump nor gallop to his re&s;cue: Williams is on the &s;pot, and is well us'd to gun-&s;hot wounds; he only wants me as &s;urgeon's mate."</Q>&mdash;Zachary now with due deliberation &s;eated him&s;elf in the chai&s;e, and the me&s;&s;enger, having mounted behind it, gave directions where to drive. Hardham was found on the ground, and Williams had ju&s;t then &s;ucceeded in &s;taunching the haemor|rhage; the ball had entered a little above the knee, and had lodged it&s;elf by a &s;lanting cour&s;e up his thigh, as he &s;tood in a crouching po&s;ture when he gave his own fire, and re|ceived that of his opponent almo&s;t at the &s;ame moment. He fell, and fainted on the ground; when he came to him&s;elf he was earne&s;t with Williams to be taken to his own hou&s;e, but
<PB N="293" REF="297">
in this he was not indulged: when Zachary arrived they found means to convey him into Lord Crowbery's hou&s;e; and Henry now, at the earne&s;t wi&s;h of his principal, took Zacha|ry's &s;eat in the chai&s;e, and ha&s;tened back to the party at Su&s;an May's. Great was their joy at his return, and every countenance (but chiefly that on which his eyes were fir&s;t fondly fixed) was brightened at his pre&s;ence. To them he related the particulars of the ren|contre, in the event of which the overween|ing pride and in&s;olence of Hardham, who was ob&s;tinate again&s;t all accommodation, was proportionably cha&s;ti&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI. The Drama clo&s;es, and the Curtain falls.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY accompanied the chai&s;e to Man|&s;tock Hou&s;e, and to gratify I&s;abella no le&s;s than him&s;elf, was hardly ever out of &s;ight by the way. Hardham, in the mean time, was depo&s;ited with all po&s;&s;ible care in the hou&s;e of his antagoni&s;t: during &s;ix days Williams, who remained in the clo&s;e&s;t attention, found
<PB N="294" REF="298">
no moment when the operation of extracting the ball could be undertaken with &s;afety to his life, which remained in &s;o precarious a &s;tate, that Lord Crowbery felt him&s;elf obliged to po&s;tpone his intended expedition; and &s;ent his lawyer, properly in&s;tructed, to pur&s;ue all nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures at O&s;tend on his behalf.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventh morning Williams &s;ucce&s;s|fully extracted the ball, and &s;ymptoms became &s;o favourable as to flatter him with a cure. Some time after this, Hardham was carried to his own hou&s;e, and Lord Crowbery's mind was relieved from its weight of anxious &s;u&s;|pence: his journey, however, was now en|tirely laid a&s;ide from the report of his agent, who&s;e attempts to trace the murderer had been entirely fruitle&s;s: the body of the de|cea&s;ed was brought over, and committed to the vault of his ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>Williams was in &s;uch favour with his pa|tient, that no other &s;urgeon was permitted to approach him. One important bu&s;ine&s;s there was, in which the fair Su&s;an had a &s;hare, that &s;uffered a po&s;tponement by his attendance upon Hardham; the matrimonial knot was not yet tied: this indeed, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, was &s;imply the delay of a ceremony; and the
<PB N="295" REF="299">
very fir&s;t lei&s;ure morning Williams could with a &s;afe con&s;cience avail him&s;elf of, that ceremony was effectually performed; and Su&s;an took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that honourable title, which her fidelity and good conduct ever after main|tained, through a &s;eries of many pro&s;perous and happy years.</P>
<P>In Man&s;tock Hou&s;e, Love took his &s;tation undi&s;turbed by any cares or interruptions, &s;ave only tho&s;e cha&s;te tremors, which the gentle brea&s;t of I&s;abella felt, whil&s;t Time, for ever on the wing, was weaving the &s;oft &s;ilken fetters, now almo&s;t complete and ready for the hand of Hymen, that arti&s;t who too often makes but blind and bungling work, coupling ill-&s;orted pairs with coar&s;e and clum&s;y tools. Not &s;uch our hero and his fair betrothed&mdash;lovely in per&s;on, lovelier in their virtues, their &s;oft and tender hearts melted into each other with a coale&s;cence &s;o entire, that &s;oul with &s;oul never more &s;weetly harmonized: yet &s;ometimes, when the ardour of his looks alarmed her, &s;he would chide him with her blu&s;hes; &s;ometimes &s;he would turn away and hide her face, or bid him go from her and join the company; this had he done, he would have mi&s;under&s;tood the &s;pirit of the order
<PB N="296" REF="300">
totally, in&s;tead of which he had a way of mak|ing peace, that nature pointed out, which gained him pardon by repeating the offence.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are incurable,"</Q> &s;he would tell him at the&s;e times, <Q REND="inline">"and I give you up; another time I'll lock my door, and keep you out."</Q>&mdash;The minutes &s;till rolled on, and yet the door was not locked; the offence was &s;till com|mitted, and the menace, though repeated, was never executed.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What are you mu&s;ing upon?"</Q> &s;he &s;aid one day, as he &s;ate rapt in thought.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am reducing days to hours,"</Q> he replied, <Q REND="inline">"and hours to minutes, that I may calculate each fraction of the interval 'twixt this and Monday."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Add to it another year,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"and you'll be nearer to the &s;um. Don't talk of Monday, I'll not hear about it."</Q>&mdash;At that moment the porter's bell announced an arrival. I&s;abella ran to the window, and de&s;cried Doctor Sandford coming up to the door.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"There, there!"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"you are all together in a plot again&s;t me: I'll not go down to Doctor Sandford; much as I e&s;teem him, I'll not quit my chamber this whole day; I know for what he comes."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He comes to ble&s;s your Henry, by entitling him to call the lovelie&s;t object in creation his;
<PB N="297" REF="301">
he comes to ratify the vows that I have made, to honour, love, and &s;erve you with my life; and what is there &s;o terrible in this, that &s;hou'd di&s;turb my I&s;abella's gentle &s;pirits? What does the ruler of my pa&s;&s;ions di&s;cern in her devoted Henry, that &s;he &s;hou'd &s;hrink from with affright? Command me, ta&s;k me as you will, and I'll obey, &s;o you do not forbid me to adore you and to doat upon you as I do this moment, have done ever, and to life's late&s;t period ever mu&s;t.&mdash;Say, I&s;a|bella, are the&s;e arms, thus pre&s;&s;ing, thus en|circling you, bonds that you wi&s;h to break, chains that you fain wou'd fever and ca&s;t from you? Que&s;tion my heart, 'tis your's; a&s;k if there's mercy in it for my I&s;abella; mark if it does not throb with tender pity and compa&s;&s;ion for your virgin fears; and wit|ne&s;s if the drops that fall from it are half &s;o dear as the&s;e which your &s;oft eyes di&s;til. Oh! my &s;oul's trea&s;ure, are you not at re&s;t upon this faithful bo&s;om? Do you not feel a con&s;cious &s;atisfaction, thus to know your|&s;elf belov'd, protected, cheri&s;h'd by a friend, who lives but on your &s;miles, nor has a &s;en&s;e of earthly happine&s;s, but what the contem|plation of your charms be&s;tows upon him?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="302"><Q REND="inline">"Oh! Henry,"</Q> &s;he replied, and &s;unk upon his brea&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"I render you my heart, and all that it contains; even my terrors are fled from me, and nothing now remains but all-&s;ubdu|ing love: your words, your looks, be&s;peak &s;uch mild con&s;ideration for your poor trem|bling I&s;abella; and I well know there is &s;uch mercy in your manly nature, that I am yours this day, this hour, this in&s;tant, and for ever."</Q>&mdash;Silence en&s;ued, what el&s;e their thoughts &s;up|plied, love found expre&s;&s;ions for, more elo|quent than words: the minutes were not few; but, rated to their value, they had outweighed years of common price.</P>
<P>I&s;abella now was not aver&s;e to welcome her late dreaded vi&s;itor, the worthy Doctor Sand|ford&mdash;&s;evered from the arms of her enraptured Henry, with love in every glance, and grace in every motion, &s;he came forth in beauty's riche&s;t bloom, a form to charm all eyes, and captivate all hearts.</P>
<P>Every body was occupied in preparations for the approaching journey: great as was the &s;acrifice Sir Roger made to the peace of the county, when he took upon him&s;elf the pain|ful duty of attending parliament, there were &s;ome circum&s;tances that qualified the di&s;agree|able
<PB N="299" REF="303">
nece&s;&s;ity at the pre&s;ent moment, as he had affairs of great con&s;equence on his hands with re&s;pect to I&s;abella's marriage, which could only be adju&s;ted in London. Mr. Delapoer, the father of our hero, had al&s;o bu&s;ine&s;s not le&s;s important, and agreed to accompany him; and a hou&s;e large enough to receive the whole party, and perfectly commodious, had fortu|nately been &s;ecured for Sir Roger, and was already well aired, and occupied by part of his hou&s;ehold, &s;ent before him for that purpo&s;e. His plan was to have the wedding on the morning of his departure, and as private as po&s;&s;ible. The Rev. Mr. Claypole, in a bad &s;tate of health, was gone to Bath, and Dr. Sandford had been invited from Hagley to perform the ceremony. The bride and bride-groom were to take their departure together, and reach town that evening; Sir Roger, Dela|poer, and Sandford were to follow in the family coach by ea&s;y &s;tages, and &s;leep by the way.</P>
<P>On the morning before the&s;e events were to take place, Henry rode over to Crowbery, and took a friendly leave of the Lord of the Ca&s;tle; he had al&s;o a parting conver&s;ation with Mr. and Mrs. Williams and the good Dame; to Ezekiel he devoted a full hour, which the
<PB N="300" REF="304">
good man filled up, after his manner, with ad|monitory le&s;&s;ons for his conduct in the me|tropolis, that &s;ink, as he pronounced it, of infamy and corruption. Ejaculations, prayers and ble&s;&s;ings in abundance he cordially &s;uper-added; and at la&s;t let him depart with this exhortation&mdash;That if affluence and pro&s;perity &s;hould await him, he would never forget that he had felt the &s;orrows of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s; but, on the contrary, if di&s;appointments and misfortunes (which Heaven avert!) &s;hould prove to be his lot, then let him take religion to his aid, and place his whole reliance on that all-gracious Ma&s;ter, who never fails his &s;ervants in affliction, when they piou&s;ly re&s;ort to him.</P>
<P>The awful morning arrived, and I&s;abella, beautiful as an angel, and fre&s;h as the dew of Heaven, ro&s;e with the dawn; and having attired her&s;elf with a &s;implicity pure as her thoughts, and elegant as her manners, came forth from her chamber, and pre&s;ented her&s;elf to the eyes of her expecting lover: he led her down the &s;tairs to the room where her friends were a&s;&s;embled, and the Rev. Dr. Sandford was in readine&s;s to perform the &s;olemn office, and pro|nounce the nuptial benediction; which &s;ervice being clo&s;ed, turning to her father, whil&s;t Henry
<PB N="301" REF="305">
yet held her trembling hand, &s;he dropt on her knees at his feet, and jointly with her hu&s;band, in the like reverential attitude, received his fatherly ble&s;&s;ing, accompanied with tears of joyful &s;en&s;ibility and tender embraces: the &s;ame &s;uit was preferred to the father of Henry, and the &s;ame affectionate return was made to it by that amiable per&s;on, in a &s;tile peculiarly impre&s;&s;ive and affecting. A few old and faith|ful dome&s;tics were admitted; and hone&s;t Za|chary Cawdle, by claim derived from long attachment, and &s;ervices as old in date as the fir&s;t breath that Henry drew, was pre&s;ent on the occa&s;ion; and now, in his ardent manner, joy boiling over at his eyes, pronounced them to be indi&s;putably the mo&s;t lovely couple that ever plighted their faith to each other&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And, by the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"upon their laudable endeavours, I predict they will give being to others as beautiful as them|&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P>They now &s;ate down to a ha&s;ty breakfa&s;t, which being di&s;patched, Sir Roger again em|braced his daughter, and then re&s;igning her hand to its happy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, attended them to the door, where their chai&s;e with po&s;t-hor&s;es was in waiting, which whirled them in their
<PB N="302" REF="306">
rapid cour&s;e to London; where they arrived, with happy omens, as the evening clo&s;ed, and found all things ready for their reception.</P>
<P>The following day the worthy Baronet, punctual to his appointed hour, arrived with his friends, Mr. Delapoer and Dr. Sandford, the latter of whom took up his abode with a relation at the other end of the town. Sir Roger was well plea&s;ed with the airy &s;ituation of his hou&s;e, and &s;till more delighted with the unremitted attention of his &s;on and daugh|ter, who devoted to him and Delapoer all tho&s;e hours which &s;ome be&s;tow on frivolous amu&s;ements, &s;ome on le&s;s innocent occupa|tions. In the cour&s;e of their re&s;idence here every thing that the &s;age provi&s;ion of the law could do for them and their po&s;terity was completed; and, at Sir Roger's &s;uit, our hero had a grant, by royal licence, to take the name and bear the arms of Man&s;tock, thus becoming the adopted repre&s;entative of that antient and opulent hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When the &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed, and they re|turned to the family &s;eat at Man&s;tock, the fe&s;tivities they had fled from were celebrated with becoming &s;plendor, and the ho&s;pitable doors were thrown open to their neighbours,
<PB N="303" REF="307">
both rich and poor. Heaven ble&s;&s;ed their days with pro&s;perity, and crowned their wi&s;hes with a beauteous offspring. Faithful to Ezekiel's charge, Henry never forgot the le&s;&s;ons of ad|ver&s;ity, nor tho&s;e faithful friends whom his adver&s;ity had tried and approved.&mdash;To Za|chary, to the hou&s;e of Williams, and to Eze|kiel, in his humble cottage, he was ever the &s;ame grateful, cordial and unaltered friend. The charge of young Blachford's affairs he devolved upon Ezekiel, with a proper allow|ance, but &s;till under his own &s;uperintendance; Lord Crowbery al&s;o put the good apo&s;tle into certain offices of tru&s;t, which brought him &s;ome profit, and, what was more grateful to his &s;pirit, a &s;ituation of &s;ome re&s;pectability among&s;t his neighbours. Williams throve in his profe&s;&s;ion, and Su&s;an was not wanting to provide him with tho&s;e that &s;erved to keep his hou&s;e a&s;ide and his indu&s;try alert.</P>
<P>Delapoer retired to his man&s;ion near Hag|ley, where he had every year the plea&s;ure of embracing his children, when they vi&s;ited their maternal man&s;ion and property in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>If perfect happine&s;s was ever dealt to mor|tals, it was &s;urely the peculiar lot of Henry and I&s;abella.&mdash;Dome&s;tic harmony that knew
<PB N="304" REF="308">
no interruption, hearts fondly united, and tem|pers happily matched, the good-will of all who knew them, the abundant gifts of for|tune, and the grateful ble&s;&s;ings of the poor, compounded their enjoyments. Meanwhile the beauteous form of I&s;abella never yielded up one fleeting charm to the wide-wa&s;ting hand of Time, but Heaven re&s;tored the lo&s;s by adding every hour fre&s;h beauties to her mind.</P>
