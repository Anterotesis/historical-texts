<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE State of Conver&s;a|tion and Bu&s;ine&s;s in this Town having been long perplexed with Pretenders in both Kinds, in order to open Men's Eyes again&s;t &s;uch Abu&s;es, it appeared no unprofitable Un|dertaking to publi&s;h a Paper which &s;hould ob&s;erve upon the Manners of the Plea&s;urable, as well as the Bu&s;ie Part of Mankind. To make this generally read, it &s;eemed the mo&s;t proper Method to form it by Way of a Let|ter of Intelligence, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch Parts as might gratify the Curio&s;ity of Per&s;ons of all Conditions, and of each Sex.
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
But a Work of this Nature re|quiring Time to grow into the Notice of the World, it hap|pened very luckily, that a little before I had re&s;olved upon this De&s;ign, a Gentleman had written Predictions, and Two or Three other Pieces in my Name, which had render'd it famous thro' all Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> and by an inimi|table Spirit and Humour, rai&s;ed it to as high a Pitch of Reputation as it could po&s;&s;ibly arrive at.</P>
<P>By this good Fortune, the Name of <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff</HI> gained an Audience of all who had any Ta&s;te of Wit, and the Addition of the ordinary Occurrences of common Journals of News brought in a Multitude of other Readers. I could not, I confe&s;s, long keep up the Opinion of the Town, that the&s;e Lucubrations
<PB N="v" REF="4">
were written by the &s;ame Hand with the fir&s;t Works which were publi&s;hed under my Name; but before I lo&s;t the Participation of that Author's Fame, I had al|ready found the Advantage of his Authority, to which I owe the &s;udden Acceptance which my Labours met with in the World.</P>
<P>The general Purpo&s;e of this Paper, is to expo&s;e the fal&s;e Arts of Life, to pull off the Di&s;gui&s;es of Cunning, Vanity, and Affecta|tion, and to recommend a general Simplicity in our Dre&s;s, our Di&s;|cour&s;e, and our Behaviour. No Man has a better Judgment for the Di&s;covery, or a nobler Spirit for the Contempt of all Impo|&s;ture, than your &s;elf; which Qua|lities render you the mo&s;t proper Patron for the Author of the&s;e E&s;&s;ays. In the general, the De|&s;ign,
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
however executed, has meet with &s;o great Succe&s;s, that there is hardly a Name now eminent a|mong us for Power, Wit, Beauty, Valour, or Wi&s;dom, which is not &s;ub&s;cribed, for the Encourage|ment of the Two Volumes in <HI>Octavo,</HI> on a <HI>Royal</HI> or <HI>Medium</HI> Pa|per. This is indeed an Honour for which it is impo&s;&s;ible to ex|pre&s;s a &s;uitable Gratitude; and there is nothing could be an Ad|dition to the Plea&s;ure I take in it, but the Reflection that it gives me the mo&s;t con&s;picuous Occa&s;ion I can ever have, of &s;ub&s;cribing my &s;elf,</P>

<P>THO' the other Papers which are pub|li&s;hed for the U&s;e of the good People of <HI>England</HI> have certainly very whol&s;om Effects, and are laudable in their parti|cular Kinds, they do not &s;eem to come up to the main De&s;ign of &s;uch Narrations, which I humbly pre&s;ume, &s;hould be principally intended for the U&s;e of politick Per&s;ons, who are &s;o publick-&s;pirited as to neglect their own Affairs to look into Tran&s;|actions of State. Now the&s;e Gentlemen, for the mo&s;t Part, being Per&s;ons of &s;trong Zeal, and weak Intellects, It is both a Charitable and Nece&s;&s;ary Work to offer &s;omething, whereby &s;uch worthy and well-affected Members of the Commonwealth may be in&s;tructed, after their Reading, <HI>what to</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="7">
<HI>think;</HI> which &s;hall be the End and Purpo&s;e of this my Paper: Wherein I &s;hall from Time to Time Report and Con&s;ider all Matters of what Kind &s;o|ever that &s;hall occur to Me, and publi&s;h &s;uch my Advices and Reflections every <HI>Tue&s;day, Thur&s;day,</HI> and <HI>Saturday</HI> in the Week, for the Convenience of the Po&s;t. I re&s;olved al&s;o to have &s;omething which may be of Entertainment to the Fair Sex, in Honour of whom I have taken the Title of this Paper. I therefore earne&s;tly de&s;ire all Per&s;ons, without Di|&s;tinction, to take it in for the pre&s;ent <HI>Gratis,</HI> and hereafter at the Price of One Penny, forbidding all Hawkers to take more for it at their Peril. And I de&s;ire all Per&s;ons to con&s;ider, that I am at a very great Charge for proper Materials for this Work, as well as that before I re&s;olved upon it, I had &s;ettled a Corre&s;pondence in all Parts of the Known and Knowing World. And fora&s;much as this Globe is not trodden upon by meer Drudges of Bu&s;ine&s;s only, but that Men of Spirit and Genius are ju&s;tly to be e&s;teemed as con&s;iderable Agents in it, we &s;hall not, upon a Dearth of News, pre&s;ent you with mu&s;ty Foreign Edicts, or dull Proclamations, but &s;hall divide our Relation of the Pa&s;&s;ages which occur in Action or Di&s;cour&s;e throughout this Town as well as el&s;ewhere, under &s;uch Dates of Places as may prepare you for the Matter you are to expect, in the following Manner:</P>
<P>All Accounts of <HI>Gallantry, Plea&s;ure,</HI> and <HI>En|tertainment,</HI> &s;hall be under the Article of <HI>White</HI>'s <HI>Chocolate-hou&s;e; Poetry</HI> under that of <HI>Will</HI>'s <HI>Coffee-hou&s;e: Learning,</HI> under the Title of <HI>Grae|cian; Foreign</HI> and <HI>Dome&s;tick News,</HI> you will have from <HI>St. James</HI>'s <HI>Coffee-hou&s;e;</HI> and what el&s;e I have to offer on any other Subject &s;hall be dated from my own <HI>Apartment.</HI></P>

<HI>Will</HI>'s, under Twopence each Day mereby for his Charges; to <HI>White</HI>'s, under Sixpence; nor to the <HI>Graecian,</HI> without allowing him &s;ome Plain <HI>Spa|ni&s;h,</HI> to be as able as others at the Learned Table; and that a good Ob&s;erver cannot &s;peak with even <HI>Kidney</HI> at St. <HI>James</HI>'s without clean Linnen. I &s;ay, the&s;e Con&s;iderations will, I hope, make all Per|&s;ons willing to comply with my Humble Reque&s;t (when my <HI>Gratis</HI> Stock is exhau&s;ted) of a Penny a-piece; e&s;pecially &s;ince they are &s;ure of &s;ome pro|per Amu&s;ement, and that it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to want Means to entertain 'em, having, be&s;ides the Force of my own Parts, the Power of Divina|tion, and that I can, by ca&s;ting a Figure, tell you all that will happen before it comes to pa&s;s.</P>

<P>THE deplorable Condition of a very pretty Gentleman, who walks here at the Hours when Men of Quality fir&s;t appear, is what is very much lamented. His Hi&s;tory is, That on the 9th of <HI>September</HI> 1705. being in his One and twentieth Year, he was wa&s;hing his Teeth at a Tavern Window in <HI>Pall-mall,</HI> when a fine Equipage pa&s;&s;ed by, and in it a young Lady who looked up at him; away goes the Coach, and the young Gentleman pulled off his Night|cap, and in&s;tead of rubbing his Gums, as he ought to do out of the Window till about Four a Clock, &s;its him down, and &s;poke not a Word till Twelve at Night; after which, he began to enquire, If any Body knew the Lady&mdash;The Company asked, What Lady? But he &s;aid
<PB N="4" REF="9">
no more, 'till they broke up at Six in the Mor|ning. All the en&s;uing Winter he went from Church to Church every Sunday, and from Play|hou&s;e to Playhou&s;e every Night in the Week, but could never find the Original of the Picture which dwelt in his Bo&s;om. In a Word, his Attention to any Thing but his Pa&s;&s;ion, was utterly gone. He has lo&s;t all the Money he ever played for, and been confuted in every Argument he has enter'd upon &s;ince the Moment he fir&s;t &s;aw her. He is of a Noble Family, has naturally a very good Air, and is of a frank, hone&s;t Temper: But this Pa&s;&s;ion has &s;o extremely mauled him, that his Features are &s;et and uninformed, and his whole Vi&s;age is deaden'd by a long Ab&s;ence of Thought. He never appears in any Alacrity, but when rai&s;ed by Wine; at which Time he is &s;ure to come hither, and throw away a great deal of Wit on Fellows, who have no Sen&s;e fur|ther than ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, That our poor Lover has mo&s;t Under&s;tanding when he is drunk, and is lea&s;t in his Sen&s;es when he is &s;ober.</P>

<P>On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> la&s;t was acted, for the Bene|fit of Mr. <HI>Betterton,</HI> the Celebrated Comedy, called <HI>Love for Love.</HI> Tho&s;e excellent Players, Mrs. <HI>Barry,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dogget,</HI> though not at pre&s;ent concerned in the Hou&s;e, acted on that Occa&s;ion. There has not b en known &s;o great a Concour&s;e of Per&s;ons of Di|&s;tinction as at that Time; the Stage it &s;elf was cover'd with Gentlemen and Ladies, and when the Curtain was drawn, it di&s;covered even there a very &s;plendid Audience. This unu&s;ual Encouragement, which was given to a Play for the Advantage of &s;o great an Actor, gives an undeniable In&s;tance, That the true Reli&s;h for Manly Entertainments and Rational Plea|&s;ures
<PB N="5" REF="10">
is not wholly lo&s;t. All the Parts were acted to Perfection: the Actors were careful of their Carriage, and no one was guilty of the Affection to in&s;ert Wittici&s;ms of his own, but a due Re&s;pect was had to the Audience, for en|couraging this accompli&s;h'd Player. It is not now doubted but Plays will revive, and take their u&s;ual Place in the Opinion of Per&s;ons of Wit and Merit, notwith&s;tanding their late Apo|&s;tacy in Favour of Dre&s;s and Sound. This Place is very much altered &s;ince Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> frequen|ted it; where you u&s;ed to &s;ee <HI>Songs, Epigrams,</HI> and <HI>Satyrs,</HI> in the Hands of every Man you met, you have now only a Pack of Cards; and in|&s;tead of the Cavils about the Turn of the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, the Elegance of the Style, and the like, the Learned now di&s;pute only about the Truth of the Game. But however, the Com|pany is altered, all have &s;hewn a great Re&s;pect for Mr. <HI>Betterton:</HI> And the very Gaming Part of this Hou&s;e have been &s;o much touched with a Sen&s;e of the Uncertainty of Humane Affairs, (which alter with them&s;elves every Moment) that in this Gentleman, they pitied <HI>Mark An|thony</HI> of <HI>Rome, Hamlet</HI> of <HI>Denmark, Mithri|datus</HI> of <HI>Pontus, Theodo&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth of <HI>England.</HI> It is well known, he has been in the Condition of each of tho&s;e illu&s;trious Per&s;onages for &s;everal Hours toge|ther, and behaved him&s;elf in tho&s;e high Sta|tions, in all the Changes of the Scene, with &s;uitable Dignity. For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, we in|tend to repeat this Favour to him on a proper Occa&s;ion, le&s;t he who can in&s;truct us &s;o well in per&s;onating Feigned Sorrows, &s;hould be lo&s;t to us by &s;uffering under Real Ones. The Town is at pre&s;ent in very great Ex|pectation of &s;eeing a Comedy now in Rehear|&s;al,
<PB N="6" REF="11">
which is the 25th Production of my Ho|noured Friend Mr. <HI>Thomas D'Urfey;</HI> who, be|&s;ides his great Abilities in the Dramatick, has a peculiar Talent in the Lyrick Way of Writing, and that with a Manner wholly new and un|known to the Ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> where|in he is but faintly imitated in the Tran&s;lations of the Modern <HI>Italian</HI> Opera's.</P>

<P>Letters from the <HI>Hague</HI> of the 16th &s;ay, That Major-General <HI>Cadogan</HI> was gone to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> with Orders to di&s;per&s;e proper In&s;tructions for a&s;&s;embling the whole Force of the Allies in <HI>Flanders</HI> in the Beginning of the next Month. The late Offers concerning Peace, were made in the Style of Per&s;ons who think them&s;elves upon equal Terms: But the Allies have &s;o ju&s;t a Sen&s;e of their pre&s;ent Advantages, that they will not admit of a Treaty, except <HI>France</HI> of|fers what is more &s;uitable to her pre&s;ent Con|dition. At the &s;ame Time we make Prepara|tions, as if we were alarmed by a greater Force than that which we are carrying into the Field. Thus this Point &s;eems now to be argued Sword in Hand. This was what a Great General al|luded to, when being asked the Names of tho&s;e who were to be Plenipotentiaries for the en&s;u|&s;uing Peace; an&s;wered, with a &s;erious Air, <HI>There are about an Hundred thou&s;and of us.</HI> Mr. <HI>Kid|ney,</HI> who has the Ear of the greate&s;t Politicians that come hither, tells me, There is a Mail come in to Day with Letters, dated <HI>Hague, A|pril</HI> 19. <HI>N. S.</HI> which &s;ay, a De&s;ign of bringing Part of our Troops into the Field at the latter End of this Month, is now altered to a Re&s;olu|tion of marching towards the Camp about the 20th of the next. There happened t'other Day, in the Road of <HI>Scheveling,</HI> an Engagement be|tween
<PB N="7" REF="12">
a Privateer of <HI>Zealand,</HI> and one of <HI>Dun|kirk.</HI> The <HI>Dunkirker,</HI> carrying 33 Pieces of Cannon, was taken and brought into the Texel.

<P>Mr. <HI>Kidney</HI> added, That there were Letters of the 17th from <HI>Ghent,</HI> which give an Ac|count, That the Enemy had formed a De&s;ign to &s;urprize two Battalions of the Allies which lay at <HI>Alo&s;t;</HI> but tho&s;e Battalions received Advice of their March, and retired to <HI>Dendermond.</HI> Lieutenant General <HI>Wood</HI> appeared on this Oc|ca&s;ion at the Head of 5000 Foot, and 1000 Hor&s;e, upon which the Enemy withdrew, without ma|king any further Attempt.</P>

<P>THere has lain all this Evening on the Ta|ble, the following Poem. The Subject of it being Matter very u&s;eful for Families, I thought it de&s;erved to be con&s;idered, and made more publick. The Turn the Poet gives it, is very happy; but the Foundation is from a real Accident which happened among my Acquain|tance. A young Gentleman of a great E&s;tate, fell de&s;perately in Love with a great Beauty, of very high Quality, but as ill-natured, as long Flattery and an habitual Self will could make her. However, my young Spark ventures upon her, like a Man of Quality, without be|ing acquainted with her, or having ever &s;aluted
<PB N="9" REF="14">
her, till it was a Crime to ki&s;s any Woman el&s;e. Beauty is a Thing which palls with Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; and the Charms of this Lady &s;oon wanted the Support of good Humour and Com|plai&s;ancy of Manners. Upon this my Spark flies to the Bottle for Relief from his Satiety. She di&s;dains him for being tired with that for which all Men envied him; and he never came Home, but it was&mdash;Was there no Sot that would &s;tay longer? Would any Man living but you? Did I leave all the World for this U&s;age? To which he&mdash;Madam, Split me, you are very impertinent! In a Word, this Match was Wedlock in its mo&s;t terrible Ap|pearances. She, at la&s;t weary of Railing to no Purpo&s;e, applies to a good Uncle, who gives her a Bottle of Water: The Vertue of this Powerful Liquor (&s;aid he) is &s;uch, that if the Woman you marry proves a Scold, (which, it &s;eems, my dear Neece, is your Misfortune; as it was your good Mother's before you,) let her hold &s;ix Spoonfuls in her Mouth, for a full half Hour after you come Home&mdash;But I find I am not in Humour for telling a Tale, and no|thing in Nature is &s;o ungrateful as Story-Telling again&s;t the Grain, therefore take it as the Author has given it you.</P>

<P>THis Evening, the Comedy, call'd <HI>The Coun|try Wife,</HI> was acted in <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> for the Benefit of Mrs. <HI>Bignall.</HI> The Part which gives Name to the Play was performed by her &s;elf. Through the whole Action, &s;he made a a very pretty Figure, and exactly entered into the Nature of the Part. Her Husband, in the <HI>Drama,</HI> is repre&s;ented to be one of tho&s;e De|bauchees who run through the Vices of the Town, and believe when they think fit they can marry and &s;ettle at their Ea&s;e. His own Knowledge of the Iniquity of the Age, makes him chu&s;e a Wife wholly ignorant of it, and place his Security in her Want of Skill how to abu&s;e him. The Poet, on many Occa&s;ions, where the Propriety of the Character will admit of it, in&s;inuates, That there is no Defence a|gain&s;t Vice, but the Contempt of it: And has, in the natural Ideas of an untainted Innocent, &s;hown the gradual Steps to Ruin and De&s;truction, which Per&s;ons of Condition run into, without the Help of a good Education how to form their Conduct. The Torment of a Jealous Cox|comb, which ari&s;es from his own Fal&s;e Ma|xims, and the Aggravation of his Pain, by the very Words in which he &s;ees her Innocence, makes a very plea&s;ant and in&s;tructive Satyr.
<PB N="16" REF="21">
The Character of <HI>Horner,</HI> and the De&s;ign of it, is a good Repre&s;entation of the Age in which that Comedy was written; at which Time Love and Wenching were the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Life, and the Gallant Manner of pur&s;uing Women was the be&s;t Recommendation at Court. To which only it is to be imputed, that a Gentle|man of Mr. <HI>Wicherly</HI>'s Character and Sen&s;e, conde&s;cends to repre&s;ent the In&s;ults done to the Honour of the Bed, without ju&s;t Reproof; but to have drawn a Man of Probity with Re|gard to &s;uch Con&s;iderations, had been a Mon|&s;ter, and a Poet had at that Time di&s;covered his Want of knowing the Manners of the Court he lived in, by a Virtuous Character in his fine Gentleman, as he would &s;how his Ig|norance, by drawing a Vicious one to plea&s;e the pre&s;ent Audience. Mrs. <HI>Bignall</HI> did her Part very happily, and had a certain Grace in her Ru&s;ticity, which gave us Hopes of &s;eeing her a very Skilful Player, and in &s;ome Parts, &s;upply our Lo&s;s of Mrs. <HI>Verbruggen.</HI> I cannot be of the &s;ame Opinion with my Friends and Fellow-Labourers, the <HI>Reformers of Manners,</HI> in their Severity towards Plays, but mu&s;t allow, that a good Play acted before a well-bred Au|dience, mu&s;t rai&s;e very proper Incitements to good Behaviour, and be the mo&s;t quick and mo&s;t prevailing Method of giving Young Peo|ple a Turn of Sen&s;e and Breeding. But as I have &s;et up for a Weekly Hi&s;torian, I re&s;olve to be a Faithful One; and therefore take this publick Occa&s;ion, to admoni&s;h a Young Noble|man, who came flu&s;tered into the Box la&s;t Night, and let him know, how much all his Friends were out of Countenance for him. The Women &s;ate in Terror of hearing &s;ome|thing that &s;hould &s;hock their Mode&s;ty, and all
<PB N="17" REF="22">
the Gentlemen in as much Pain, out of Com|pa&s;&s;ion to the Ladies, and perhaps Re&s;entment for the Indignity which was offered in coming into their Pre&s;ence in &s;o di&s;re&s;pectful a Man|ner. Wine made him &s;ay nothing that was Rude, therefore he is forgiven, upon Condition he weill never hazard his offending more in this Kind. As I ju&s;t now hinted, I own my &s;elf of the Society for <HI>Reformation of Manners.</HI> We have lower In&s;truments than tho&s;e of the Fa|mily of <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> for puni&s;hing great Crimes, and expo&s;ing the Abanddoned. Therefore, as I di&s;ign to have Notices from all Publick A&s;&s;em|blies, I &s;hall take upon me only Indecorums, Improprieties, and Negligences, in &s;uch as &s;hould give us better Examples. After this De|claration; if a Fine Lady thinks fit to giggle at Church, or a Great Beau come in drunk to a Play, either &s;hall be &s;ure to hear of it in my en|&s;uing Paper: For meerly as a well-bred Man, I cannot bear the&s;e Enormities.</P>
<P>After the Play, we naturally &s;troll to this Coffee-hou&s;e, in Hopes of meeting &s;ome new Poem, or other Entertainment, among the Men of Wit and Plea&s;ure, where there is a Dearth a pre&s;ent. But it is wonderful there &s;hould be &s;o few Writers, when the Art is be|come meerly Mechanick, and Men may make them&s;elves Great that Way, by as certain and infallible Rules, as you may be a Joiner or a Ma&s;on. There happens a good In&s;tance of this, in what the Hawker ju&s;t now has offered to Sale; to wit, <HI>In&s;tructions to Vanderbank; A Sequel to the Advice to the Poets; A poem, oc|ca&s;ioned by the Glorious Succe&s;s of Her Maje&s;ty's Arms, under the Command of the Duke of</HI> Marl|borought, <HI>the la&s;t Tear in</HI> Flanders. Here you are to under&s;tand, that the Author finding the
<PB N="18" REF="23">
Poets would not take his Advice, he troubles him&s;elf no more about 'em; but has met with one <HI>Vanderbank,</HI> who works in Arras, and makes very good Tape&s;try Hangings: There|fore, in order to celebrate the Hero of the Age, he claps me together all that can be &s;aid of a Man that makes Hangings: As,<Q><L>Then, Arti&s;t, who do&s;t Nature's Face expre&s;s</L>
<L>In Silk and Gold, and Scenes of Action dre&s;s;</L>
<L>Do&s;t figur'd Arras animated leave,</L>
<L>Spin a Bright Story, or a Pa&s;&s;ion weave</L>
<L>By mingling Threads; can&s;t mingle Shade and Light,</L>
<L>Delineate Triumphs, or de&s;cribe a Fight?</L></Q></P>
<P>Well, what &s;hall this Work man do? Why? To &s;how how great an Hero the Poet intends, he provides him a very good Hor&s;e:
<Q><L>Champing his Foam, and bounding on the Plain</L>
<L>Arch his High Neck, and Graceful &s;pread his Mane.</L></Q></P>
<P>Now as to the Intrepidity, the calm Cou|rage, the con&s;tant Application of the Hero, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to take that upon your &s;elf; you may, in the Lump, bid him you employ rai&s;e him as High as he can, and if he does it not, let him an&s;wer for di&s;obeying Orders.<Q><L>Let Fame and Victory in inferior Sky,</L>
<L>Hover with ballanc'd Wings, and &s;miling fly</L>
<L>Above his Head, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>A whole Poem of this Kind may be ready again&s;t an en&s;uing Campagne, as well as a Space left in the Canva&s;s of a Piece of Tape|&s;try for the principal Figure, while the Under-Parts are working: So that in Effect, the Ad|vi&s;er copies after the Man he pretends to direct.
<PB N="19" REF="24">
This Method &s;hould, methinks, encourage young Beginners: For the Invention is &s;o fitted to all Capacities, that by the Help of it a Man may make a Receipt for a Poem. A young Man may ob&s;erve, that the Gigg of the Thing is, as I &s;aid, finding out all that can be &s;aid of his Way you employ to &s;et forth your Worthy. <HI>Waller</HI> and <HI>Denham</HI> had worn out the Expe|dient of <HI>Advice to a Painter:</HI> This Author has transferred the Work, and &s;ent his <HI>Advice to the Poets;</HI> that is to &s;ay, to the <HI>Turners of Ver&s;e,</HI> as he calls 'em. Well, that Thought is worn out al&s;o, therefore he directs his Genius to the Loom, and will have a new Set of Hang|ings in Honour of the la&s;t Year in <HI>Flanders.</HI> I mu&s;t own to you, I approve extremely this Invention, and it might be improved for the Benefit of Manufactury: As, &s;uppo&s;e an Inge|nious Gentleman &s;hould write a Poem of Ad|vice to a Callico-Printer: Do you think there is a Girl in <HI>England,</HI> that would wear any Thing but <HI>The Taking of Li&s;le,</HI> or <HI>The Battle of Oudenarde?</HI> They would certainly be all the Fa&s;hion, till the Heroes Abroad had cut out &s;ome more Parterns. I &s;hould fancy &s;mall Skirmi&s;hes might do for Under-Petticoats, pro|vided they had a Siege for the Upper. If our Advi&s;er were well imitated, many Indu&s;trious People might be put to Work. Little Mr. <HI>Dactile,</HI> now in the Room, who formerly writ a Song and a Half, is a Week gone in a very pretty Work, upon this Hint: He is writing an Epi|gram to a young Virgin who knits very well ('tis a Thou&s;and Pities he is a <HI>Jacobite</HI>): But his Epigram is by Way of Advice to this Dam&s;el, to knit all the Actions of the <HI>Pretender</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> la&s;t Campagne in the Clock of a Stocking. It were endle&s;s to enumerate
<PB N="20" REF="25">
the many Hands and Trades that may be em|ployed by Poets, of &s;o u&s;eful a Turn as this Advi&s;er's. I &s;hall think of it; and in this Time of Taxes, &s;hall con&s;ult a great Critick employed in the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, in order to pro|po&s;e what Tax may be proper to put upon Knives, Seals, Rings, Hangings, Wrought-Beds, Gowns and Petticoats, where any of tho&s;e Commodities bear Motto's, or are worked upon Poetical Grounds.</P>

<P>ALL Hearts at pre&s;ent pant for Two La|dies only, who have for &s;ome Time en|gro&s;&s;ed the Dominion of the Town. They are indeed both exceeding Charming, but differ very much in their Excellencies. The Beauty of <HI>Clari&s;&s;a</HI> is Soft, that of <HI>Chloe</HI> Piercing. When you look at <HI>Clari&s;&s;a,</HI> you &s;ee the mo&s;t exact Harmony of Feature, Complexion, and Shape; you find in <HI>Chloe</HI> nothing extraordinary in any one of tho&s;e Particulars, but the whole Wo|man irre&s;i&s;tible. <HI>Clari&s;&s;a</HI> looks Langui&s;hing; <HI>Chloe</HI> Killing. <HI>Clari&s;&s;a</HI> never fails of gaining Admiration; <HI>Chloe</HI> of moving De&s;ire. The Gazers at <HI>Clari&s;&s;a</HI> are at fir&s;t unconcerned, as if they were ob&s;erving a fine Picture. They who behold <HI>Chloe,</HI> at the fir&s;t Glance, di&s;cover Tran&s;port, as if they met their deare&s;t Friend. The&s;e different Perfections are &s;uitably repre|&s;ented by the la&s;t great Painter <HI>Italy</HI> has &s;ent us, Mr. <HI>Jerva&s;e. Clari&s;&s;a</HI> is, by that skilful Hand, placed in a Manner that looks artle&s;s, and innocent of the Torments &s;he gives; <HI>Chloe</HI> drawn with a Liveline&s;s that &s;hows &s;he is con|&s;cious, but not affected, of her Perfections. <HI>Clari&s;&s;a</HI> is a Shepherde&s;s; <HI>Chloe</HI> a Country Girl. I mu&s;t own, the De&s;ign of <HI>Chloe</HI>'s Picture &s;hows, to me, great Ma&s;tery in the Painter; for nothing could be better imagined than the Dre&s;s he has given her, of a Straw-Hat and Ribband, to repre&s;ent that Sort of Beauty which enters the Heart with a certain Familiarity, and cheats it into a Belief, that it has received a Lover as well as an Object of Love. The Force of their different Beauties is &s;een al&s;o in the Effects it makes on their Lovers. The Ad|mirers of <HI>Chloe</HI> are eternally gay and well|plea&s;ed: Tho&s;e of <HI>Clari&s;&s;a,</HI> melancholy and
<PB N="24" REF="29">

<P>Letters from the <HI>Hay-market</HI> inform us, That on <HI>Saturday</HI> Night la&s;t the Opera of <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> and <HI>Demetrius</HI> was performed with great Ap|plau&s;e.

He has communicated his Scheme to the whole Room, and declared in what Manner Things of this Kind were fir&s;t introduced. He has upon this Occa&s;ion con&s;idered the Nature of Sounds in general, and made a very elaborate Digre&s;&s;ion upon the <HI>London Cries,</HI> wherein he has &s;hown from Rea&s;on and Philo&s;ophy, why Oy&s;ters are cried, Card-matches &s;ung, and Turneps and all other Vegetables neither cried, &s;ung, nor &s;aid, but &s;old, with an Accent and Tone neither natu|ral to Man or Bea&s;t.

<P>I have lately been very &s;tudious for Intelli|gence, and have ju&s;t now, by my A&s;trological Flying-Po&s;t, received a Packet from <HI>Felicia,</HI> an I&s;land in <HI>America,</HI> with an Account that gives me great Satisfaction, and lets me under|&s;tand that the I&s;land was never in greater Pro&s;perity, or the Admini&s;tration in &s;o good Hands, &s;ince the Death of their late glorious King.

Tho&s;e Per&s;ons at the Helm are &s;o u&s;eful, and in them&s;elves of &s;uch Weight, that their &s;trict Alliance mu&s;t needs tend to the univer&s;al Pro&s;|perity of the People. <HI>Camillo,</HI> it &s;eems, pre|&s;ides

<Q><L>WHO names that lo&s;t Thing, Love, without a Tear,</L>
<L>Since &s;o debauch'd by ill-bred Cu&s;toms here.</L>
<L>To an exact Perfection they have brought</L>
<L>The Action, Love, the Pa&s;&s;ion is forgot.</L></Q>
<P>This was long ago a witty Author's Lamenta|tion, but the Evil &s;till continues; and if a Man of any Delicacy were to attend the Di&s;cour&s;es of the young Fellows of this Age, they would believe there were none but Pro&s;titutes to make the Objects of Pa&s;&s;ion. So true it is what the Author of the above Ver&s;es &s;aid, a little before his Death, of the modern Pretenders to Gal|lantry: <Q REND="inline">"They &s;et up for Wits in this Age, by &s;aying when they are Sober, what they of the la&s;t &s;poke only when they were Drunk."</Q> But <HI>Cupid</HI> is not only Blind at pre&s;ent, but Dead|drunk; he has lo&s;t all his Faculties: El&s;e how &s;hould <HI>Celia</HI> be &s;o long a Maid with that agreea|ble Behaviour? <HI>Corinna,</HI> with that &s;prightly Wit? <HI>Lesbia,</HI> with that Heavenly Voice? And <HI>Sachari&s;&s;a,</HI> with all tho&s;e Excellencies in one Per&s;on, frequent the Park, the Play, and murder the poor Tits that drag her to publick Places, and not a Man turn pale at her Appearance? But &s;uch is the fallen State of Love, that if it were not for hone&s;t <HI>Cynthio,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="35">
who is true to the Cau&s;e, we &s;hould hardly have a Pattern left of the ancient Worthies that Way: And indeed he has but very little Encourage|ment to per&s;evere; but he has a Devotion, ra|ther than Love, for his Mi&s;tre&s;s; and &s;ays,<Q><L>Only tell her that I love,</L>
<L>Leave the re&s;t to her, and Fate;</L>
<L>Some kind Planet from Above,</L>
<L>May, perhaps, her Pa&s;&s;ion move:</L>
<L>Lovers on their Stars mu&s;t wait.</L></Q></P>
<P>But the Stars I am &s;o intimately acquainted with, that I can a&s;&s;ure him he will never have her: For would you believe it, tho' <HI>Cynthio</HI> has Wit, Good Sen&s;e, Fortune, and his very Being depends upon her, the Termagant for whom he fighs, is in Love with a Fellow, who &s;tares in the Gla&s;s all the Time he is with her, and lets her plainly &s;ee, &s;he may po&s;&s;ibly be his Rival, but never his Mi&s;tre&s;s. Yet <HI>Cynthio,</HI> the &s;ame unhappy Man whom I mentioned in my fir&s;t Narrative, plea&s;es him&s;elf with a vain Imagina|tion, that with the Language of his Eyes, now he has found who &s;he is, he &s;hall conquer her, though her Eyes are intent upon one who looks from her; which is ordinary with the Sex. It is certainly a Mi&s;take in the Ancients, to draw the little Gentleman, <HI>Love,</HI> as a blind Boy; for his real Character is, a little Thief that &s;quints. For ask Mrs. <HI>Meddle,</HI> who is a Confident, or Spy, upon all the Pa&s;&s;ions in Town, and &s;he'll tell you, that the Whole is a Game of Cro&s;s Purpo&s;es. The Lover is generally pur&s;uing one who is in Pur&s;uit of another, and running from one that de&s;ires to meet him. Nay, the Nature of this Pa&s;&s;ion is &s;o ju&s;tly repre&s;ented in a &s;quinting little Thief, (who is always in a Double Action) that do but ob&s;erve <HI>Clari&s;&s;a</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="36">
next Time you &s;ee her, and you'll find, when her Eyes have made their &s;oft Tour round the Company, &s;he makes no Stay on him they &s;ay &s;he is to marry, but re&s;ts Two Seconds of a Mi|nute on <HI>Wildair,</HI> who neither looks nor thinks on her, or any Woman el&s;e. However, <HI>Cynthio</HI> had a Bow from her t'other Day, upon which he is very much come to him&s;elf; and I heard him &s;end his Man of an Errand Ye&s;terday with|out any Manner of He&s;itation; a Quarter of an Hour after which he reckoned Twenty, re|member'd he was to &s;up with a Friend, and went exactly to his Appointment.

<P>This Week being Sacred to Holy Things, and no publick Diver&s;ions allowed, there has been taken Notice of, even here, a little Treati&s;e, called, <HI>A Project for the Advancement of Reli|gion: Dedicated to the Counte&s;s of</HI> Berkeley.

It is written with the Spirit of one who has &s;een the World enough to un|dervalue it with good Breeding.

<P>Letters from <HI>Italy</HI> &s;ay, That the Marquis <HI>de Prie,</HI> upon the Receipt of an Expre&s;s from the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> went immediately to the Pa|lace of Cardinal <HI>Paulucci,</HI> Mini&s;ter of State to his Holine&s;s, and demanded in the Name of his Imperial Maje&s;ty, that King <HI>Charles</HI> &s;hould be forthwith acknowledged King of <HI>Spain,</HI> by a &s;olemn Act of the Congregation of Cardinals appointed for that Purpo&s;e: He declared at the &s;ame Time, That if the lea&s;t He&s;itation were made in this mo&s;t important Article of the late Treaty, he &s;hould not only be obliged to leave <HI>Rome</HI> him&s;elf, but al&s;o tran&s;mit his Ma&s;ter's Orders to the Imperial Troops to face about, and return into the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Dominions. When the Cardinal reported this Me&s;&s;age to the Pope, his Holine&s;s was &s;truck with &s;o &s;en&s;ible an Affliction, that he bur&s;t into Tears. His Sor|row was aggravated by Letters which imme|diately after arrived from the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> wherein his Nuncio acquainted him, That upon the News of his Accommodation with the Em|peror, he had received a Me&s;&s;age to forbear com|ing to Court; and the People were &s;o highly pro|voked, that they could hardly be re&s;train'd from in&s;ulting his Palace. The&s;e Letters add, That the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> was gone from <HI>Florence</HI> to <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> and from <HI>Pi&s;a</HI> to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> where the Go|vernour paid his Maje&s;ty all imaginable Ho|nours.

in 6 Days, brought Advice. That the Fleet com|manded by Admiral <HI>Whitaker</HI> was &s;afely ar|rived at <HI>Barcelona,</HI> with the Troops and Ammu|nition which he had taken in at <HI>Naples.</HI></P>
<P>General <HI>Boneval,</HI> Governo of <HI>Commacchio,</HI> had &s;ummoned the Magi&s;trates of all the Towns near that Place to appear before him, and take an Oath of Fidelity to his Imperial Maje&s;ty, commanding al&s;o the Gentry to pay him Ho|mage, on Pain of Death and Confi&s;cation of Goods. Advices from <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland</HI> inform us, That the Bankers of <HI>Geneva</HI> were utterly rui|ned by the Failure of Mr. <HI>Bernard.</HI> They add, That the Deputies of the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Cantons were returned from <HI>Soleure,</HI> where they were a&s;&s;em|bled at the In&s;tance of the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador; but were very much di&s;&s;atisfied with the Re|ception they had from that Mini&s;ter. 'Tis true, he omitted no Civilities, or Expre&s;&s;ions of Friend&s;hip from his Ma&s;ter, but he took no Notice of their Pen&s;ions and Arrears; what further provoked their Indignation, was, That in&s;tead of 25 Pi&s;toles formerly allowed to each Member for their Charge in coming to the Diet, he had pre&s;ented them with 6 only. They write from <HI>Dre&s;den,</HI> That King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> was &s;till bu&s;ie in recruiting his Cavalry, and that the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Troops, which lately &s;erved in <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> had Orders to be in <HI>Saxony</HI> in the Middle of <HI>May,</HI> and that his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Denmark</HI> was expected at <HI>Dre&s;den</HI> in the Beginning of that Month. King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> makes great Prepara|tions for his Reception, and has appointed Six|ty Coaches, each drawn by Six Hor&s;es, for that Purpo&s;e: The Interview of the&s;e Princes af|fords great Matter for Speculation.

hitherto been hit upon, in order to in&s;pire the Love and Admiration of worthy Actions, you will, Gentle Reader, I hope, accept of it for In|telligence you had not before.

Take it as follows:</P>
<P>At the Siege of <HI>Namur</HI> by the Allies, there were in the Ranks of the Company commanded by Captain <HI>Pincent,</HI> in Colonel <HI>Frederick Hamil|ton</HI>'s Regiment, one <HI>Unnion</HI> a Corporal, and one <HI>Valentine</HI> a private Centinel: There happened between the&s;e Two Men a Di&s;pute about a Mat|ter of Love, which, upon &s;ome Aggravations, grew to an irreconcileable Hatred. <HI>Unnion</HI> be|ing the Officer of <HI>Valentine,</HI> took all Opportuni|ties even to &s;trike his Rival, and profe&s;s the Spite and Revenge which moved him to it. The Centinel bore it without Re&s;i&s;tance, but frequent|ly &s;aid, He would die to be revenged of that Tyrant. They had &s;pent whole Months thus, one injuring, the other complaining; when in the Mid&s;t of this Rage towards each other, they were commanded upon the Attack of the Ca|&s;tle, where the Corporal received a Shot in the Thigh, and fell; the <HI>French</HI> pre&s;&s;ing on, and he expecting to be trampled to Death, called out to his Enemy, Ah, <HI>Valentine!</HI> Can you leave me here? <HI>Valentine</HI> immediately ran back, and in the Mid&s;t of a thick Fire of the <HI>French,</HI> took the Corporal upon his Back, and brought him thro' all that Danger as far as the Abbey of <HI>Sal&s;ine,</HI> where a Cannon-Ball took off his Head: His Bo|dy fell under his Enemy whom he was carrying
<PB N="36" REF="41">
off. <HI>Unnion</HI> immediately forgot his Wound, ro&s;e up, tearing his Hair, and then threw him&s;elf up|on the bleeding Carca&s;s, crying, Ah <HI>Valentine!</HI> Was it for me, who have &s;o barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed thee, that thou ha&s;t died? I will not live after thee. He was not by any Means to be forced from the Body, but was removed with it bleed|ing in his Arms, and attended with Tears by all their Comrades, who knew their Enmity. When he was brought to a Tent, his Wounds were dre&s;&s;ed by Force; but the next Day, &s;till calling upon <HI>Valentine,</HI> and lamenting his Cruel|ties to him, he died in the Pangs of Remor&s;e and De&s;pair.</P>
<P>It may be a Que&s;tion among Men of Noble Sentiments, Whether of the&s;e unfortunate Per|&s;ons had the greater Soul, he that was &s;o gene|rous as to venture his Life for his Enemy, or he who could not &s;urvive the Man that died, in lay|ing upon him &s;uch an Obligation?</P>
<P>When we &s;ee Spirits like the&s;e in a People, to what Heights may we not &s;uppo&s;e their Glory may ari&s;e, but (as it is excellently ob|&s;erved by <HI>Sallu&s;t</HI>) it is not only to the general Bent of a Nation that great Revolutions are owing, but to the extraordinary Genio's that lead 'em. On which Occa&s;ion he proceeds to &s;ay, That the <HI>Roman</HI> Greatne&s;s was neither to be attributed to their &s;uperior Poli y, for in that the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> excelled; nor to their Valour, for in that the <HI>French</HI> were preferable; but to particular Men, who were born for the Good of their Country, and formed for great Attempts. This he &s;ays to introduce the Characters of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Cato.</HI> It would be entring into too weighty a Di&s;cour&s;e for this Place, if I attempted to &s;how, that our Na|tion has produced as great and able Men for
<PB N="37" REF="42">
publick Affairs as any other. But I believe, the Reader outruns me, and fixes his Imagination upon the Duke of <HI>Marlborough.</HI> It is, me|thinks, a plea&s;ing Reflection to con&s;ider the Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence in the Fortune of this Illu&s;trious Man, who, in the Space of Forty Years, has pa&s;&s;ed through all the Grada|tions of Humane Life, till he has a&s;cended to the Character of a Prince, and become the Scourge of a Tyrant, who &s;ate in one of the greate&s;t Thrones of <HI>Europe,</HI> before the Man who was to have the greate&s;t Part in his Downfal had made one Step in the World. But &s;uch Elevations are the Natural Con&s;e|quences of an exact Prudence, a calm Courage, a well governed Temper, a patient Ambition, and an affable Behaviour. The&s;e Arts, as they are the Steps to his Greatne&s;s, &s;o they are the Pillars of it now it is rai&s;ed. To this her Glo|rious Son, <HI>Great Britain</HI> is indebted for the hap|py Conduct of her Arms, in whom &s;he can boa&s;t, She has produced a Man formed by Na|ture to lead a Nation of Heroes.</P>

<P>I AM ju&s;t come from vi&s;iting <HI>Sappho,</HI> a fine Lady, who writes Ver&s;es, &s;ings, dances, and can &s;ay and do whatever &s;he plea&s;es, without the Imputation of any Thing that can injure her Character; for &s;he is &s;o well known to have no Pa&s;&s;ion but Self-Love, or Folly but Affectation, that now upon any Occa&s;ion, they only cry, <HI>'Tis her Way,</HI> and <HI>That's &s;o like her,</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="43">
without further Reflection. As I came into the Room, &s;he cries, Oh! Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> I am utterly undone! I have broke that pretty <HI>Italian</HI> Fan I &s;howed you when you were here la&s;t, wherein were &s;o admirably drawn our Fir&s;t Parents in <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> a&s;leep in each other's Arms. But there is &s;uch an Affinity between Painting and Poetry, that I have been impro|ving the Images which were rai&s;ed by that Picture, by reading the &s;ame Repre&s;entation in Two of our greate&s;t Poets. Look you, here are the Pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Milton</HI> and in <HI>Dryden.</HI> All <HI>Milton</HI>'s Thoughts are wonderfully ju&s;t and na|tural, in this inimitable De&s;cription which <HI>Adam</HI> makes of him&s;elf in the Eighth Book of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</HI> But there is none of them finer than that contained in the following Lines, where he tells us his Thoughts when he was falling a&s;leep a little after his Creation:</P>
<Q><L>While thus I call'd, and &s;tray'd I know not whi|ther,</L>
<L>From whence I fir&s;t drew Air, and fir&s;t beheld</L>
<L>This happy Light; when An&s;wer none return'd,</L>
<L>On a green &s;hady Bank, profu&s;e of Flowers,</L>
<L>Pen&s;ive I &s;ate me down, there gentle Sleep</L>
<L>Fir&s;t found me, and with &s;oft Oppre&s;&s;ion &s;eiz'd</L>
<L>My drowned Sen&s;e, untroubled, though I thought</L>
<L>I then was pa&s;&s;ing to my former State,</L>
<L>In&s;en&s;ible and forthwith to di&s;&s;olve.</L></Q>
<P>But now I can't forgive this odious Thing: This <HI>Dryden,</HI> who, in his <HI>State of Innocence,</HI> has given my Great-Grandmother <HI>Eve</HI> the &s;ame Apprehen&s;ion of Annihilation on a very diffe|rent Occa&s;ion: As <HI>Adam</HI> pronounces it of him&s;elf. when he was &s;eized with a plea&s;ing Kind of Stupor and Deadne&s;s, <HI>Eve</HI> fancies her|&s;elf
<PB N="39" REF="44">
falling away, and di&s;&s;olving in the Hurry of a Rapture. However, the Ver&s;es are very good, and I don't know but it may be natural what &s;he &s;ays. I'll read 'em:</P>
<Q><L>When your kind Eyes look'd langui&s;hing on mine,</L>
<L>And wreathing Arms did &s;oft Embraces join;</L>
<L>A doubtful Trembling &s;eiz'd me fir&s;t all o'er,</L>
<L>Then Wi&s;hes, and a Warmth unknown before:</L>
<L>What follow'd, was all Exta&s;ie and Trance,</L>
<L>Immortal Plea&s;ures round my &s;wimming Eyes did dance;</L>
<L>And &s;peechle&s;s Joys, in who&s;e &s;weet Tumults to&s;t,</L>
<L>I thought my Breath and my New Being lo&s;t.</L></Q>
<P>She went on, and &s;aid a Thou&s;and good Things at Random, but &s;o &s;trangely mixed, that you would be apt to &s;ay, All her Wit is meer good Luck, and not the Effect of Rea&s;on and Judgment. When I made my E&s;cape hi|ther, I found a Gentleman playing the Critick on Two other great Poets, even <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Ho|mer.</HI> He was ob&s;erving, that <HI>Virgil</HI> is more judicious than the other in the Epithets he gives his Hero. <HI>Homer</HI>'s u&s;ual Epithet, &s;aid he, is <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, or <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and his Indi&s;cre|tion has been often rallied by the Criticks, for mentioning the Nimblene&s;s of Foot in <HI>Achilles,</HI> though he de&s;cribes him &s;tanding, &s;itting, lying down, fighting, eating, drinking, or in any other Circum&s;tance, however foreign or repugnant to Speed and Activity. <HI>Virgil</HI>'s common Epi|thet to <HI>Aeneas,</HI> is <HI>Pius,</HI> or <HI>Pater.</HI> I have there|fore con&s;idered, &s;aid he, what Pa&s;&s;age there is in any of his Hero's Actions, where either of the&s;e Appellations would have been mo&s;t im|proper, to &s;ee if I could catch him at the &s;ame Fault with <HI>Homer:</HI> And this, I think, is his Meeting with <HI>Dido</HI> in the Cave, where <HI>Pius</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="45">
<HI>Aeneas</HI> would have been Ab&s;urd, and <HI>Pater Aeneas</HI> a Burle&s;que: The Poet has therefore wi&s;ely dropped 'em both for <HI>Dux Trojanus.</HI><Q><L>Speluncam Dido Dux &amp; Trojanus candem</L>
<L>Deveniunt, &mdash;</L></Q> Which he has repeated twice in <HI>Juno</HI>'s Speech, and his own Narration: For he very well knew, a loo&s;e Action might be con&s;i&s;tent enough with the u&s;ual Manners of a Soldier, tho' it became neither the Cha&s;tity of a Pious Man, nor the Gravity of the Father of a People.</P>

<P>While other Parts of the Town are amu&s;ed with the pre&s;ent Actions, we generally &s;pend the Evening at this Table in Enquiries into An|tiquity, and think any Thing News which gives us new Knowledge. Thus we are ma|king a very plea&s;ant Entertainment to our &s;elves, in putting the Actions of <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Iliad</HI> into an exact Journal.</P>
<P>This Poem is introduced by <HI>Chry&s;es,</HI> King of <HI>Chry&s;eis,</HI> and Prie&s;t of <HI>Apollo,</HI> who comes to re|demand his Daughter, who was carried off at the Taking of that City, and given to <HI>Aga|memnon</HI> for his Part of the Booty. The Refu|&s;al he received enrages <HI>Apollo,</HI> who for Nine Days &s;howered down Darts upon them, which occa&s;ioned the Pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>The 10th Day <HI>Achilles</HI> a&s;&s;embles the Coun|cil, and encourages <HI>Calchas</HI> to &s;peak for the Surrender of <HI>Chry&s;eis</HI> to appea&s;e <HI>Apollo. Aga|memnon</HI> and <HI>Achilles</HI> &s;torm at one another, notwith&s;tanding which <HI>Agamemnon</HI> will not relea&s;e his Pri&s;oner, unle&s;s he has <HI>Bri&s;eis</HI> in her Stead. After long Conte&s;tations, wherein <HI>Aga|memnon</HI> gives a glorious Character of <HI>Achil|les</HI>'s Valour, he determines to re&s;tore <HI>Bri&s;eis</HI> to
<PB N="41" REF="46">
her Father, and &s;ends Two Heralds to fetch away <HI>Chry&s;eis</HI> from <HI>Achilles,</HI> who abandons him|&s;elf to Sorrow and De&s;pair. His Mother <HI>Thetis</HI> came to comfort him under his Affliction, and promi&s;es to repre&s;ent his &s;orrowful Lamenta|tions to <HI>Jupiter:</HI> But he could not attend it; for the Evening before, he had appointed to divert him&s;elf for Two Days beyond the Seas with the harmle&s;s <HI>Aethiopians.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas the 21&s;t Day after <HI>Chry&s;eis</HI>'s Arrival to the Camp, that <HI>Thetis</HI> went very early to demand an Audience of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> The Means he u&s;es to &s;atisfie her were, to per&s;wade the <HI>Greeks</HI> to attack the <HI>Trojans;</HI> that &s;o they might perceive the Con&s;equence of contemning <HI>Achil|les,</HI> and the Mi&s;eries they &s;uffer if he does not head them. The next Night he orders <HI>Aga|memnon,</HI> in a Dream, to attack them; who was deceived with the Hopes of obtaining a Victo|ry, and al&s;o taking the City without &s;haring the Honour with <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>
<P>On the 22d in the Morning, he a&s;&s;embles the Council, and having made a Feint of rai&s;ing the Siege and retiring, he declares to them his Dream; and, together with <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> re&s;olves on an Engagement.</P>
<P>This was the 23d Day, which is full of Inci|dents, and which continues from almo&s;t the Beginning of the Second Canto to the Eighth. The Armies being then drawn up in View of one another, <HI>Hector</HI> brings it about, that <HI>Mene|laus</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> the Two Per&s;ons concerned in the Quarrel, &s;hould decide it by a &s;ingle Com|bat; which tending to the Advantage of <HI>Mene|laus,</HI> was interrupted by a Cowardice infu&s;ed by <HI>Minerva:</HI> Then both Armies engage, where the <HI>Trojans</HI> have the Di&s;advantage; but being afterwards animated by <HI>Apollo,</HI> they repul&s;e
<PB N="42" REF="47">
the Enemy, yet they are once again forced to give Ground; but their Affairs were retrieved by <HI>Hector,</HI> who has a &s;ingle Combat with <HI>Ajax.</HI> The Gods threw them&s;elves into the Battle, Juno and <HI>Minerva</HI> took the <HI>Gracians</HI> Part, and <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI> the <HI>Trojans:</HI> But <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Ve|nus</HI> are both wounded by <HI>Diomedes.</HI></P>
<P>The Truce for burying the Slain ended the 23d Day; after which the <HI>Greeks</HI> threw up a great Intrenchment to &s;ecure their Navy from Danger. Councils are held on both Sides. On the Morning of the 24th Day, the Battle is re|newed, but in a very di&s;advantagious Manner to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who were beaten back to their Retrenchments. <HI>Agamemnon</HI> being in De&s;pair at this ill Succe&s;s, propo&s;es to the Coun&s;el to quit the Enterprize and retire from <HI>Troy.</HI> But by the Advice of <HI>Ne&s;tor,</HI> he is per&s;waded to re|gain <HI>Achilles,</HI> by returning <HI>Chry&s;eis,</HI> and &s;ending him con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents. Hereupon, <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Ajax</HI> are &s;ent to that Hero, who conti|nues inflexible in his Anger. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> at his Return, joins him&s;elf with <HI>Diomedes,</HI> and goes in the Night to gain Intelligence of the Ene|my: They enter into their very Camp, where, finding the Centinels a&s;leep, they made a great Slaughter. <HI>Rhe&s;us,</HI> who was ju&s;t then arrived with Recruits from <HI>Thrace</HI> for the <HI>Trojans,</HI> was killed in that Action. Here ends the 10th Can|to. The Sequel of this Journal will be in&s;erted in the next Article from this Place.</P>

<P>We hear from <HI>Italy,</HI> That notwith&s;tanding the Pope has received a Letter from the Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> demanding of him to explain him&s;elf upon the Affair of acknowledging King <HI>Charles,</HI> his Holine&s;s has not yet thought fit to &s;end any An&s;wer to that Prince. The Court of <HI>Rome</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="48">
appears very much mortified, that they are not to &s;ee his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Denmark</HI> in that City, ha|ving perhaps given them&s;elves vain Hopes from a Vi&s;it made by a Prote&s;tant Prince to that See. The Pope has di&s;patched a Gentleman to com|pliment his Maje&s;ty, and &s;ent the King a Pre|&s;ent of all the Curio&s;ities and Antiquities of <HI>Rome,</HI> repre&s;ented in Seventeen Volumes, very richly bound, which were taken out of the <HI>Vatican</HI> Library. Letters from <HI>Genoa</HI> of the 14th In&s;tant &s;ay, A <HI>Felucca</HI> was arrived there in Five Days from <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> with an Account, That the People of that City had made an In|&s;urrection, by rea&s;on of the Scarcity of Provi|&s;ions; and that the Intendant had ordered &s;ome Companies of Marines, and the Men belonging to the Gallies, to &s;tand to their Arms to pro|tect him from Violence; but that he began to be in as much Apprehen&s;ion of his Guards, as tho&s;e from whom they were to defend him. When that Ve&s;&s;el came away, the Soldiers murmured publickly for Want of Pay; and it was generally believed, they would pillage the Magazines, as the Garri&s;ons of <HI>Grenoble,</HI> and other Towns of <HI>France,</HI> had already done. A Ve&s;&s;el which lately came into <HI>Leghorn</HI> brought Advice, That the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Squadron was arrived at <HI>Port Mahon,</HI> where they were taking in more Troops, in order to attempt the Relief of <HI>Alicant,</HI> which &s;till made a very vigorous Defence. 'Tis &s;aid, Admiral <HI>Bing</HI> will be at the Head of that Expedition. The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> was gone from <HI>Leghorn</HI> towards <HI>Lucca.</HI></P>
<P>They write from <HI>Vienna,</HI> That in ca&s;e the Allies &s;hould enter into a Treaty of Peace with <HI>France,</HI> Count <HI>Zinzendorf</HI> will be appointed Fir&s;t Plenipotentiary, the Count <HI>de Goes</HI> the Se|cond,

<P>We are al&s;o informed, That the Pope u&s;es all imaginable Shifts to elude the Treaty con|cluded with the Emperor, and that he demand|ed the immediate Re&s;titution of <HI>Commacchio,</HI> in&s;i&s;ting al&s;o, That his Imperial Maje&s;ty &s;hould ask Pardon, and de&s;ire Ab&s;olution for what has formerly pa&s;&s;ed, before he would &s;olemnly ac|knowledge King <HI>Charles:</HI> But this was utterly refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>They hear at <HI>Vienna,</HI> by Letters from <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> dated the 22d of <HI>February</HI> la&s;t, That on the 12th of that Month the Grand Signior took Occa&s;ion, at the Celebration of the Fe&s;ti|vals of the <HI>Mu&s;&s;elmen,</HI> to &s;et all the Chri&s;tian Slaves which were in the Galleys at Liberty.</P>
<P>Advices from <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland</HI> import, That the Preachers of the County of <HI>Tockenburg</HI> conti|nue to create new Jealou&s;ies of the Prote&s;tants, and &s;ome Di&s;turbances lately happened there on that Account. The Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts in the Town of <HI>Hamman</HI> go to Divine Service one after another in the &s;ame Church, as is u&s;ual in many other Parts of <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland;</HI> but on <HI>Sunday</HI> the 10th In&s;tant, the Popi&s;h Curate having ended his Service, attempted to hinder the Prote&s;tants from entring into the Church according to Cu&s;tom; but the Prote&s;tants brisk|ly attacked him and his Party, and broke into it by Force.</P>

<P>The pre&s;ent great Captains of the Age, the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> ha|ving been the Subject of the Di&s;cour&s;e of the la&s;t Company I was in, it has naturally led me into a Con&s;ideration of <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> the Two greate&s;t Names which ever appeared before this Century. In order to enter into their Characters, there needs no more but exa|mining their Behaviour in Parallel Circum|&s;tances. It mu&s;t be allowed, That they had an equal Greatne&s;s of Soul; but <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s was more corrected and allayed by a Mixture of Prudence and Circum&s;pection. This is &s;een con&s;picuou&s;ly in one Particular in their Hi&s;to|ries, wherein they &s;eem to have &s;hown exactly the Difference of their Tempers. When <HI>Alex|ander,</HI> after a long Cour&s;e of Victories, would &s;till have led his Soldiers farther from Home, they unanimou&s;ly refu&s;ed to follow him. We meet with the like Behaviour in <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Army in the Mid&s;t of his March again&s;t <HI>Ariovi&s;tus.</HI> Let us therefore ob&s;erve the Conduct of our Two Generals in &s;o nice an Affair: And here we find <HI>Alexander</HI> at the Head of his Army, upbraiding them with their Cowardice, and Meanne&s;s of Spirit; and in the End, telling them plainly, He would go forward him&s;elf, though not a Man followed him. This &s;how|ed indeed an exce&s;&s;ive Bravery; but how would the Commander have come off, if the Speech had not &s;ucceeded, and the Soldiers had taken him at his Word? The Project &s;eems of a Piece with Mr. <HI>Bays</HI>'s in the <HI>Rehear&s;al,</HI> who, to gain a Clap in his Prologue, comes out, with a ter|rible Fellow in a Fur-Cap following him, and
<PB N="46" REF="51">
tells his Audience, If they would not like his Play, he would lie down and have his Head &s;truck off. If this gained a Clap, all was well; but if not, there was nothing left but for the Executioner to do his Office. But <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> would not leave the Succe&s;s of his Speech to &s;uch un|certain Events: He &s;hews his Men the Unrea|&s;onablene&s;s of their Fears in an obliging Man|ner, and concludes, That if none el&s;e would march along with them, he would go him&s;elf with the Tenth Legion, for he was a&s;&s;ured of their Fidelity and Valour, though all the re&s;t for&s;ook him; not but that in all Probability they were as much again&s;t the March as the re&s;t. The Re&s;ult of all was very natural: The Tenth Legion fired with the Prai&s;es of their Ge|neral, &s;end Thanks to him for the ju&s;t Opinion he entertains of 'em; and the re&s;t, a&s;hamed to be outdone, a&s;&s;ure him, That they are as rea|dy to follow where he plea&s;es to lead them, as any other Part of the Army.</P>

<P>Thus far, in as brief and intelligible a Manner as any Will can appear, till it is explained by the Learned, I have di&s;po&s;ed of my Real and Per&s;onal E&s;tate: But, as I am an Adept, I have by Birth an equal Right to give al&s;o an indefea|&s;ible Title to my Endowments and Qualifications; which I do in the following Manner:</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> I give my Cha&s;tity to all Virgins who have with&s;tood their Market.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> I give my Courage among all who are a&s;hamed of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Friends, all Sneakers in A&s;&s;emblies, and Men who &s;how Valour in Com|mon Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> I give my Wit, (as Rich Men give to the Rich) among &s;uch as think they have enough already. And in ca&s;e they &s;hall not accept of the Legacy, I give it to <HI>Bentivolio,</HI> to defend his Works from Time to Time, as he &s;hall think fit to publi&s;h 'em.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> I be&s;tow my Learning upon the Honourary Members of the Royal Society.</P>
<P><HI>Now for the Di&s;po&s;al of this Body.</HI></P>
<P>As the&s;e Eyes mu&s;t one Day cea&s;e to gaze on <HI>Teraminta,</HI> and this Heart &s;hall one Day pant no more for her Indignation: That is to &s;ay, &s;ince this Body mu&s;t be Earth, I &s;hall commit it to the Du&s;t in a Manner &s;uitable to my Character. Therefore, as there are tho&s;e who di&s;pute, Whether there is any &s;uch Real Per&s;on as <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="54">
or not? I &s;hall excu&s;e all Per&s;ons who appear what they really are, from coming to my Funeral. But all tho&s;e who are, in their Way of Life, <HI>Per&s;onae,</HI> as the <HI>Latins</HI> have it, Per&s;ons a&s;&s;umed, and who appear what they really are not, are hereby invited to that Solemnity.</P>
<P>The Body &s;hall be carried by Six Watchmen, who are never &s;een in the Day.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> The Pall &s;hall be held up by the Six mo&s;t known Pretenders to Hone&s;ty, Wealth and Power, who are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any of them. The Two Fir&s;t, an Half Lawyer, a Compleat Ju&s;tice. The Two next, a Chymi&s;t, a Projector. The Third Couple, a Trea&s;ury Solicitor, and a &s;mall Courtier.</P>
<P>To make my Funeral (what that Solemnity, when done to common Men, really is in it &s;elf) a very Farce; and &s;ince all Mourners are meer Actors on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, I &s;hall de&s;ire tho&s;e who are profe&s;|&s;edly &s;uch, to attend me. I humbly therefore be&s;eech Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> to act once more, and be my Widow-When &s;he &s;woons away at the Church-Porch, I ap|point the Merry Sir <HI>John Fal&s;taff,</HI> and the Gay Sir <HI>Harry Wildair,</HI> to &s;upport her. I de&s;ire Mr. <HI>Penkethman</HI> to follow in the Habit of a Cardi|nal, and Mr. <HI>Bullock</HI> in that of a Privy-Councel|lor. To make up the re&s;t of the Appearance, I de&s;ire all the Ladies from the Balconies to weep with Mrs. <HI>Barry,</HI> as they hope to be Wives and Widows them&s;elves. I invite all, who have no|thing el&s;e to do, to accept of Gloves and Scarves.</P>
<P>Thus, with the Great <HI>Charles V.</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> I re&s;ign the Glories of this Tran&s;itory World: Yet, at the &s;ame Time, to &s;how you my Indifference, and that my De&s;ires are not too much fixed upon any Thing, I own to you, I am as willing to &s;tay as go: Therefore leave it in the Choice of my Gen|tle Readers, whether I &s;hall hear from them, or they hear no more from me.</P>

In &s;hort, he was in his whole Per&s;on and Dre&s;s &s;o extremely &s;ou&s;ed, that there did not appear one Inch or &s;ingle Thread about him unmar|ried.

However, we attended to the Chap|pel, where we &s;tay'd to hear the irrevocable Words pronounced upon our old Servant, and made the be&s;t of our Way to Town. I took a Re&s;olution to forbear all married Per&s;ons, or any in Danger of being &s;uch, for Four and twenty Hours at lea&s;t; therefore dre&s;&s;ed, and went to vi&s;it <HI>Florimell,</HI> the vaine&s;t Thing in Town, where I knew would drop in Colonel <HI>Picket,</HI> ju&s;t come from the Camp, her profe&s;&s;ed Admirer.

<P>This Evening the Comedy, called <HI>Ep&s;om-Wells,</HI> was acted for the Benefit of Mr. <HI>Bullock,</HI> who, though he is a Per&s;on of much Wit and Ingenuity, has a peculiar Talent of looking like a Fool, and therefore excellently well qua|lified for the Part of <HI>Bisket</HI> in this Play.

<P>THE Play of <HI>The London Cuckolds</HI> was acted this Evening before a &s;uitable Audience, who were extremely well diverted with that Heap of Vice and Ab&s;urdity. The Indignation which <HI>Eugenio,</HI> who is a Gentleman of a ju&s;t Ta&s;t, has, upon Occa&s;ion of &s;eeing humane Na|ture fall &s;o low in their Delights, made him, I thought, expatiate upon the Mention of this Play very agreeably. Of all Men living, &s;aid he, I pity Players, (who mu&s;t be Men of good Un|der&s;tanding to be capable of being &s;uch) that they are obliged to repeat and a&s;&s;ume proper Ge&s;tures for repre&s;enting Things of which their Rea&s;on mu&s;t be a&s;hamed, and which they mu&s;t di&s;dain their Audience for approving. The A|mendment of the&s;e low Gratifications is only to be made by People of Condition, by encoura|ging the Pre&s;entation of the Noble Characters drawn by <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> and others, from whence it is impo&s;&s;ible to return without &s;trong Impre&s;|&s;ions of Honour and Humanity. On the&s;e Oc|ca&s;ions, Di&s;tre&s;s is laid before us with all its Cau&s;es and Con&s;equences, and our Re&s;entment placed according to the Merit of the Per&s;ons af|flicted. Were <HI>Drama</HI>'s of this Nature more ac|ceptable to the Ta&s;t of the Town, Men who have Genius would bend their Studies to excel in 'em. How forcible an Effect this would have on our Minds, one needs no more than to ob&s;erve
<PB N="57" REF="62">
how &s;trongly we are touched by meer Pictures. Who can &s;ee <HI>Le Brun</HI>'s Picture of the Battle of <HI>Porus,</HI> without entring into the Character of that fierce gallant Man, and being accordingly &s;purred to an Emulation of his Con&s;tancy and Courage? When he is falling with his Wound, the Fea|tures are at the &s;ame Time very terrible and langui&s;hing; and there is &s;uch a &s;tern Faintne&s;s diffu&s;ed through all his Look, as is apt to move a kind of Horrour, as well as Pity in the Be|holder. This, I &s;ay, is an Effect wrought by meer Lights and Shades, con&s;ider al&s;o a Repre|&s;entation made by Words only, as in an Account given by a good Writer: <HI>Catiline</HI> in <HI>Sallu&s;t</HI> makes ju&s;t &s;uch a Figure as <HI>Porus</HI> by <HI>Le Brun.</HI> It is &s;aid of him, Catilina <HI>vero longe a &s;uis inter Ho&s;tium Cadavera repertus e&s;t; paululum etiam &s;pirans, Ferocitatemque Animi quam vivus habue|rat in Vultu retinens.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'<HI>Catiline</HI> was found kill'd far from his own Men among the dead Bo|dies of the Enemy: He &s;eemed &s;till to breath, and &s;till retained in his Face the &s;ame Fierce|ne&s;s he had when he was living."</Q> You have in that one Sentence a lively Impre&s;&s;ion of his whole Life and Actions. What I would in&s;i|nuate from all this, is, That if the Painter and the Hi&s;torian can do thus much in Colours and Language, what may not be performed by an excellent Poet? When the Character he draws is repre&s;ented by the Per&s;on, the Manner, the Look, and the Motion, of an accompli&s;hed Play|er: If a Thing painted or related can irre&s;i&s;ti|bly enter our Hearts, what may not be brought to pa&s;s by &s;eeing generous Things performed be|fore our Eyes? <HI>Eugenio</HI> ended his Di&s;cour&s;e, by recommending the apt U&s;e of a Theatre, as the mo&s;t agreeable and ea&s;ie Method of making a polite and moral Gentry, which would end in rendring the re&s;t of the People regular in their

<P>After the La&s;&s;itude of a Day &s;pent in the &s;trolling Manner, which is u&s;ual with Men of Plea&s;ure in this Town, and with a Head full of a Million of Impertinencies, which had danced round it for Ten Hours together, I came to my Lodging, and ha&s;tened to Bed. My Valet de Chambre knows my Univer&s;ity. Trick of read|ing there; and he being a good Scholar for a Gentleman, ran over the Names of <HI>Horace, Ti|bullus, Ovid,</HI> and others, to know which I would have. Bring <HI>Virgil,</HI> &s;aid I, and if I fall a&s;leep, take Care of the Candle. I read the Sixth Book over with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite De|light, and had gone half through it a &s;econd Time, when the plea&s;ing Idea's of <HI>Ely&s;ian</HI> Fields,
<PB N="60" REF="65">
decea&s;ed Worthies walking in them, &s;incere Lo|vers enjoying their Langui&s;hment without Pain, Compa&s;&s;ion for the unhappy Spirits who had mi&s;pent their &s;hort Day-light, and were exiled from the Seats of Bli&s;s for ever; I &s;ay, I was deep again in my Reading, when this Mixture of Images had taken Place of all others in my Imagination before, and lulled me into a Dream, from which I am ju&s;t awake, to my great Di&s;|advantage. The happy Man&s;ions of <HI>Ely&s;ium</HI> by Degrees &s;eemed to be wafted from me, and the very Traces of my late walking Thoughts began to fade away, when I was ca&s;t by a &s;udden Whirlwind upon an I&s;land, encompa&s;&s;ed with a roaring and troubled Sea, which &s;hak'd its very Centre, and rocked its Inhabitants as in a Cradle. The I&s;landers lay on their Faces with|out offering to look up, or hope for Pre&s;erva|tion; all her Harbours were crowded with Mariners, and tall Ve&s;&s;els of War lay in Dan|ger of being driven to Pieces on her Shores. Ble&s;s me! &s;aid I, why have I lived in &s;uch a Manner, that the Convul&s;ion of Nature &s;hould be &s;o terrible to me, when I feel in my &s;elf, that the better Part of me is to &s;urvive it? Oh! may that be in Happine&s;s. A &s;udden Shriek, in which the whole People on their Faces join|ed, interrupted my Soliloquy, and turned my Eyes and Attention to the Object which had given us that &s;udden Start, in the Mid&s;t of an incon&s;olable and &s;peechle&s;s Affliction. Imme|diately the Winds grew calm, the Waves &s;ub&s;ided, and the People &s;tood up, turning their Faces upon a magnificent Pile in the Mid&s;t of the I&s;land. There we beheld an Hero of a comely and erect A&s;pect, but pale and languid, &s;itting under a Canopy of State. By the Faces and dumb Sorrow of tho&s;e who attended, we thought him in the Article of Death. At a Di&s;tance &s;ate a Lady, who&s;e Life &s;eemed to
<PB N="61" REF="66">
hang upon the &s;ame Thread with his: She kept her Eyes fixed upon him, and &s;eemed to &s;mother Ten Thou&s;and Thou&s;and namele&s;s Things, which urged her Tenderne&s;s to cla&s;p him in her Arms: But her Greatne&s;s of Spirit overcame tho&s;e Sentiments, and gave her Power to forbear di&s;turbing his la&s;t Moment; which immediately approached. The Hero looked up with an Air of Negligence, and Satiety of Be|ing, rather than of Pain to leave it; and leaning back his Head, expired.</P>
<P>When the Heroine, who &s;ate at a Di&s;tance, &s;aw his la&s;t In&s;tant come, &s;he threw her &s;elf at his Feet, and kneeling, pre&s;&s;ed his Hand to her Lips; in which Po&s;ture &s;he continued under the Agony of an unutterable Sorrow, till con|ducted from our Sight by her Attendants. That commanding Awe, which accompanies the Grief of great Minds, re&s;trained the Multitude while in her Pre&s;ence; but as &s;oon as &s;he retired, they gave Way to their Di&s;traction, and all the I&s;landers called upon their decea&s;ed Hero. To him, methought, they cried out, as to a Guar|dian Being, and I gathered from their broken Accents, That it was he who had the Empire over the Ocean and its Powers, by which he had long protected the I&s;land from Shipwreck and Inva|&s;ion. They now give a Loo&s;e to their Moan, and think them&s;elves expo&s;ed without Hopes of Humane or Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance. While the Peo|ple ran wild, and expre&s;&s;ed all the different Forms of Lamentation, methought a Sable Cloud over-&s;hadowed the whole Land, and co|vered its Inhabitants with Darkne&s;s: No Glimp&s;e of Light appeared, except one Ray from Heaven upon the Place in which the He|roine now &s;ecluded her &s;elf from the World, with her Eyes fixed on tho&s;e Abodes to which her Con&s;ort was a&s;cended. Methought a long Period of Time had pa&s;&s;ed away in Mourning
<PB N="62" REF="67">
and in Darkne&s;s, when a Twilight began by Degrees to enlighten the Hemi&s;phere; and look|ing round me, I &s;aw a Boat rowed towards the Shore, in which &s;ate a Per&s;onage adorned with Warlike Trophies, bearing on his left Arm a Shield, on which was engraven the Image of <HI>Victory,</HI> and in his Right Hand a Branch of O|live. His Vi&s;age was at once &s;o winning and &s;o awful, that the Shield and the Olive &s;eemed equally &s;uitable to his Genius.</P>
<P>When this illu&s;trious <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About this Time the D. of <HI>M.</HI> returned from <HI>Holland</HI> with the Preliminaries of a Peace.</NOTE> Per&s;on touched on the Shore, he was received by the Acclamations of the People, and followed to the Palace of the Heroine. No Plea&s;ure in the Glory of her Arms, or the Acclamations of her applauding Subjects, were ever capable to &s;u&s;pend her Sorrow for one Moment, till &s;he &s;aw the Olive Branch in the Hand of that au&s;picious Me&s;&s;enger. At that Sight, as Heaven be&s;tows its Ble&s;&s;ings on the Wants and Importunities of Mortals, out of its Native Bounty, and not to encrea&s;e its own Power or Honour, in Compa&s;&s;ion to the World, the Cele&s;tial Mourner was then fir&s;t &s;een to turn her Regard to Things below; and taking the Branch out of the Warrior's Hand, looked at it with much Satisfaction, and &s;poke of the Ble&s;|&s;ings of Peace, with a Voice and Accent, &s;uch as that in which Guardian Spirits whi&s;per to dy|ing Penitents A&s;&s;urances of Happine&s;s. The Air was hu&s;hed, the Multitude attentive, and all Nature in a Pau&s;e, while &s;he was &s;peaking. But as &s;oon as the Me&s;&s;enger of Peace had made &s;ome low Reply, in which, methought, I heard the Word <HI>Iberia,</HI> the Heroine a&s;&s;uming a more &s;evere Air, but &s;uch as &s;poke Re&s;olution, without Rage, returned him the Olive, and
<PB N="63" REF="68">
again veiled her Face. Loud Cries and Cla&s;hing of Arms immediately followed, which forced me from my charming Vi&s;ion, and drove me back to the&s;e Man&s;ions of Care and Sorrow.</P>

<P>THis Evening we were entertained with <HI>The Old Batchelor,</HI> a Comedy of de&s;erved Re|putation. In the Character which gives Name to the Play, there is excellently repre&s;ented the Reluctance of a battered Debauchee to come into the Trammels of Order and Decency: He neither langui&s;hes nor burns, but frets, for Love. The Gentlemen of more regular Behaviour are drawn with much Spirit and Wit, and the <HI>Dra|ma</HI> introduced by the Dialogue of the fir&s;t Scens with uncommon, yet natural, Conver&s;ation. The Part of <HI>Fondlewife</HI> is a lively Image of the un&s;ea|&s;onable Fondne&s;s of Age and impotence. But in|&s;tead of &s;uch agreeable Works as the&s;e, the Town has this half Age been tormented with In&s;ects, called <HI>Ea&s;ie Writers,</HI> who&s;e Abilities Mr. <HI>Wicherly</HI> one Day de&s;cribed excellently well in one Word: <HI>That,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>among the&s;e Fellows is called</HI> Ea&s;y Writing, <HI>which any one may ea&s;ily write.</HI> Such Jantie Scribblers are &s;o ju&s;tly laughed at for their Sonnets on <HI>Phillis</HI> and <HI>Chloris,</HI> and Fanta&s;tical De&s;criptions in 'em, that an ingenious Kin&s;man of mine, of the Family of the <HI>Staffs,</HI> Mr. <HI>Humphrey Wag&s;taff</HI> by Name, has, to avoid their Strain, run into a Way perfectly new, and de&s;cribed Things exactly as they happen: He never forms Fields, or Nymphs, or Groves, where they are not, but
<PB N="64" REF="69">
makes the Incidents ju&s;t as they really appear. For an Example of it, I &s;tole out of his Manu|&s;cript the following Lines: They are a De&s;crip|tion of the Morning, but of the Morning in Town; nay, of the Morning at this End of the Town, where my Kin&s;man at pre&s;ent lodges.</P>
<Q><L>Now hardly here and there an Hackney-Coach</L>
<L>Appearing, &s;how'd the ruddy Morn's Approach.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Betty</HI> from her Ma&s;ter's Bed had flown,</L>
<L>And &s;oftly &s;tole to di&s;compo&s;e her own.</L>
<L>The Slip&s;hod 'Prentice from his Ma&s;ter's Door,</L>
<L>Had par'd the Street, and &s;prinkled round the Floor.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Moll</HI> had whirl'd her Mop with dextr'ous Airs,</L>
<L>Prepar'd to &s;crub the Entry and the Stairs.</L>
<L>The Youth with broomy Stumps began to trace</L>
<L>The Kennel Edge, where Wheels had worn the Place.</L>
<L>The Smallcoal Man was heard with Cadence deep,</L>
<L>Till drown'd in &s;hriller Notes of Chimney &s;weep.</L>
<L>Duns at his Lord&s;hip's Gate began to meet;</L>
<L>And Brickdu&s;t <HI>Moll</HI> had &s;cream'd through half a Street.</L>
<L>The Turnkey now his Flock returning &s;ees,</L>
<L>Duly let out a' Nights to &s;teal for Fees.</L>
<L>The watchful Bailiffs take their &s;ilent Stands;</L>
<L>And School-boys lag with Satchels in their Hands.</L></Q>
<P>All that I apprehend is, that dear <HI>Numps</HI> will be angry I have publi&s;hed the&s;e Lines; not that he has any Rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of them, but for fear of tho&s;e Rogues, the Bane to all excel|lent Performances, the <HI>Imitators.</HI> Therefore, beforehand, I bar all De&s;criptions of the Even|ing; as, a Medley of Ver&s;es &s;ignifying, Grey-Peas are now cried warm: That Wenches now begin to amble round the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Play|hou&s;e: Or of Noon; as, That find Ladies and great Beaux are ju&s;t yawning out of their Beds and Windows in <HI>Pall-Mall,</HI> and &s;o forth. I forewarn al&s;o all Per&s;ons from encouraging any Draughts after my Cou&s;in; and foretel any
<PB N="65" REF="70">
Man who &s;hall go about to imitate him, that he will be very in&s;ipid. The Family Stock is em|barked in this De&s;ign, and we will not admit of Counterfeits: Dr. <HI>Ander&s;on</HI> and his Heirs enjoy his Pills, Sir <HI>Willium Read</HI> has the Cure of Eyes, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ro&s;elli</HI> can only cure the Gout. We pretend to none of the&s;e Things; but to exa|mine who and who are together, to tell any mi&s;taken Man he is not what he believes he is, to di&s;tingui&s;h Merit, and expo&s;e fal&s;e Pretences to it, is a Liberty our Family has by Law in 'em, from an Inter-Marriage with a Daughter of Mr. <HI>Scoggin,</HI> the famous Droll of the la&s;t Centu|ry. This Right I de&s;ign to make U&s;e of; but will not encroach upon the above-mentioned Adepts, or any other. At the &s;ame Time I &s;hall take all the Privileges I may, as an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and will lay hold of the late Act of Naturaliza|tion to introduce what I &s;hall think fit from <HI>France.</HI> The U&s;e of that Law may, I hope, be extended to people the polite World with new Characters, as well as the Kingdom it &s;elf with new Subjects. Therefore an Author of that Na|tion, called <HI>Le Bruyere,</HI> I &s;hall make bold with on &s;uch Occa&s;ions. The la&s;t Per&s;on I read of in that Writer, was, Lord <HI>Timon. Timon,</HI> &s;ays my Author, is the mo&s;t generous of all Men; but is &s;o hurri|ed away with that &s;trong Impul&s;e of Be&s;towing, that he confers Benefits without Di&s;tinction, and is Munificent without laying Obligations. For all the Unworthy, who receive from him, have &s;o little Sen&s;e of this noble Infirmity, that they look upon them&s;elves rather as Partners in a Spoil, than Partakers of a Bounty. The other Day, coming into <HI>Paris,</HI> I met <HI>Timon</HI> going out on Hor&s;eback, attended only by one Servant. It &s;truck me with a &s;udden Damp, to &s;ee a Man of &s;o excellent a Di&s;po&s;ition, and that under&s;tood making a Figure &s;o very well, &s;o much &s;horten'd
<PB N="66" REF="71">
in his Retinue. But pa&s;&s;ing by his Hou&s;e, I &s;aw his great Coach break to Pieces before his Door, and, by a &s;trange Inchantment, immediately turned into many different Vehicles. The fir&s;t was a very pretty Chariot, into which &s;tep'd his Lord&s;hip's Secretary. The &s;econd was hung a little heavier; into that &s;trutted the Fat Steward. In an In&s;tant follow'd a Chai&s;e, which was enter'd by the Butler. The re&s;t of the Body and Wheels were forthwith changed into Go-carts, and ran away with by the Nur&s;es and Brats of the re&s;t of the Family What makes the&s;e Misfortunes in the Affairs of <HI>Timon</HI> the more a&s;toni&s;hing, is, That he has a better Under&s;tanding than tho&s;e who cheat him; &s;o that a Man knows not which more to wonder at, the Indifference of the Ma|&s;ter, or the Impud nce of the Servant.</P>

<P>It is a Matter of much Speculation among the Beaus and Oglers, what it is that can have made &s;o &s;uddeu a Change, as has been of late ob&s;erved, in the whole Behaviour of <HI>Pa&s;torella,</HI> who never &s;ate &s;till a Moment till &s;he was Eigh|teen, which &s;he has now exceeded by Two Months. Her Aunt, who has the Care of her, has not been always &s;o rigid as &s;he is at this pre&s;ent Date; but has &s;o good a Sen&s;e of the Frailty of Woman, and Fal&s;hood of Man, that &s;he re&s;olved on all Manner of Methods to keep <HI>Pa&s;torella,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, in Safety, again&s;t her &s;elf, and all her Admirers. At the &s;ame Time the good Lady knew by long Experience, that a gay Inclination, curbed too ra&s;hly, would but run to the greater Exce&s;&s;es for that Re&s;traint: Therefore intended to watch her, and take &s;ome Opportunity of engaging her in&s;en&s;ibly in her own Intere&s;ts, without the Angui&s;h of an Admonition. You are to know then, That Mi&s;s, with all her Flirting and Ogling, had al&s;o
<PB N="67" REF="72">
naturally a &s;trong Curio&s;ity in her, and was the greate&s;t Eves-Dropper breathing. <HI>Pari&s;atis</HI> (for &s;o her prudent Aunt is called) ob&s;erved this Humour, and retires one Day to her Clo&s;et, into which &s;he knew <HI>Pa&s;torella</HI> would peep, and li&s;ten to know how &s;he was employed. It happened accordingly, and the young Lady &s;aw her good Governante on her Knees, and after a mental Behaviour, break into the&s;e Words: <HI>As for the dear Child committed to my Care, let her Sobriety of Carriage, and Severity of Behaviour, be &s;uch, as may make that Noble Lord, who is taken with her Beauty, turn his De|&s;igns to &s;uch as are honourable.</HI> Here <HI>Pari&s;atis</HI> heard her Neece ne&s;tle clo&s;er to the Key-Hole: She then goes on; <HI>Make her the joyful Mother of a numerous and wealthy Offspring; and let her Carriage be &s;uch, as may make this Noble Youth expect the Ble&s;&s;ings of an happy Marriage, from the Singularity of her Life, in this loo&s;e and cen|&s;orious Age.</HI> Mi&s;s having heard enough, &s;neaks off for Fear of Di&s;covery, and immediately, at her Gla&s;s, alters the Sitting of her Head; then pulls up her Tucker, and forms her&s;elf into the exact Manner of <HI>Lindamira:</HI> In a Word, be|comes a &s;incere Convert to every Thing that's commendable in a fine young Lady; and Two or Three &s;uch Matches as her Aunt feigned in her Devotions, are at this Day in her Choice. This is the Hi&s;tory and Original Cau&s;e of <HI>Pa&s;to|rella</HI>'s Conver&s;ion from Coquettry. The Pru|dence in the Management of this young Lady's Temper, and good Judgment of it, is hardly to be exceeded. I &s;carce remember a greater In|&s;tance of Forbearance of the u&s;ual peevi&s;h Way with which the Aged treat the Young, than this, except that of our famous <HI>Noy,</HI> who&s;e good Na|ture went &s;o far, as to make him put off his Admonitions to his Son, even till after his Death,
<PB N="68" REF="73">
and did not give him his Thoughts of him, till he came to read that memo able Pa&s;&s;age in his Will: <HI>All the re&s;t of my E&s;tate,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I leave to my Son</HI> Edward <HI>(who is Executor to this my Will) to be &s;quandred as he &s;hall think fit: I leave it him for that Purpo&s;e, and hope no better from him.</HI> A generous Di&s;dain, and Reflection upon how little he de&s;erved from &s;o excellent a Father, reformed the young Man, and made <HI>Edward,</HI> from an errant Rake, become a fine Gentleman.</P>

<P>MY Brother <HI>I&s;aac</HI> having a &s;udden Occa&s;ion to go out of Town, ordered me to take upon me the Di&s;patch of the next Advices from Home, with Liberty to &s;peak it my own Way;
<PB N="70" REF="75">
not doubting the Allowances which would be given to a Writer of my Sex. You may be &s;ure, I undertook it with much Satisfaction: And I confe&s;s, I am not a little plea&s;ed with the Op|portunity of running over all the Papers in his Clo&s;et, which he has left open for my U&s;e on this Occa&s;ion. The fir&s;t that I lay my Hands on, is, A Treati&s;e concerning <HI>The Empire of Beauty,</HI> and the Effects it has had in all Nations of the World, upon the publick and private Actions of Men; with an Appendix, which he calls, <HI>The Batchelor's Scheme for Governing his Wife.</HI> The fir&s;t Thing he makes this Gentleman propo&s;e, is, That &s;he &s;hall be no Woman; for &s;he is to have an Aver&s;ion to Balls, to Opera's, to Vi&s;its: She is to think his Company &s;uffi|cient to fill up all the Hours of Life with great Satisfaction: She is never to believe any other Man Wi&s;e, Learned, or Valiant; or at lea&s;t but in a &s;econd Degree. In the next Place, he in|tends &s;he &s;hall be a Cuckold; but expects, that he him&s;elf mu&s;t live in perfect Security from that Terror. He dwells a great while on In&s;tructions for her di&s;creet Behaviour, in ca&s;e of his Fal&s;hood. I have not Patience with the&s;e unrea&s;onable Expectations, therefore turn back to the Treati&s;e it &s;elf. Here, indeed, my Bro|ther deduces all the Revolutions among Men from the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love; and in his Preface, an&s;wers that u&s;ual Ob&s;ervation again&s;t us, <HI>That there is no Quarrel without a Woman in it;</HI> with a gallant A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>That there is nothing el&s;e worth Quarrelling for.</HI> My Brother is of a Com|plexion truly Amorous; all his Thoughts and Actions carry in 'em a Tincture of that obliging Inclination; and this Turn has opened his Eyes to &s;ee, we are not the incon&s;iderable C eatures which unlucky Pretenders to our Favour would in&s;inuate. He ob&s;erves, That no Man begins to
<PB N="71" REF="76">

It has an immediate Effect upon his Behaviour. There is Colonel <HI>Ranter,</HI> who never &s;poke without an Oath, till he &s;aw the Lady <HI>Betty Modi&s;h;</HI> now never gives his Man an Order, but it is, Pray <HI>Tom,</HI> do it.

<P>Every Temper, except downright in&s;ipid, is to be animated and &s;oftned by the Influence of Beauty: But of this untractable Sort is a life|le&s;s hand&s;ome Fellow that vi&s;its us, whom I have dre&s;&s;ed at this Twelvemonth; but he is as in&s;en&s;ible of all the Arts I u&s;e, as if he conver&s;ed all that Time with his Nur&s;e. He outdoes our whole Sex in all the Faults our Enemies im|pute to us; he has brought Lazine&s;s into an Opi|nion, and makes his Indolence his Philo&s;ophy: In&s;omuch, that no long r ago than Ye&s;terday in the Evening he gave me this Account of him|&s;elf: <HI>I am, Madam, perfectly unmoved at all that pa&s;&s;es among Men, and &s;eldom gives my &s;elf the Fa|tigue of going among 'em; but when I do, I always appear the &s;ame Thing to tho&s;e whom I conver&s;e with. My Hours of Exi&s;tence, or being awake, are from Eleven in the Morning to Eleven at Night; half of which I live to my &s;elf, in picking my Teeth, wa&s;hing my Hands, paring my Nails, and looking in the Gla&s;s. The In&s;ignificancy of my Manners to the re&s;t of the World, makes the Laughers call me a</HI> Quid Nunc, <HI>a Phra&s;e which I neither under|&s;tand, or &s;hall ever enquire what they mean by it. The la&s;t of me each Night is at St.</HI> James<HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e,</HI>

And thus, Madam, have I arrived by Lazine&s;s, to what others pretended to by Philo&s;ophy, a perfect Neglect of the World.</HI> Sure, if our Sex had the Liberty of frequenting Publick Hou&s;es and Con|ver&s;ations, we &s;hould put the&s;e Rivals of our Faults and Follies out of Countenance.

This will be of great Service for us, and I have Authority to promi&s;e an exact Jour|nal of their Deliberations; the Publication of which I am to be allowed for Pin-Money. In the mean Time, I ca&s;t my Eye upon a new Book, which gave me a more plea&s;ing Entertainment, being a &s;ixth Part of Mi&s;cellany Poems, pub|li&s;h'd by <HI>Jacob Ton&s;on;</HI> which, I find, by my Bro|ther's Notes upon it, no Way inferior to the other Volumes. There are, it &s;eems, in this, a Collection of the be&s;t Pa&s;torals that have hi|therto appeared in <HI>England;</HI> but among them, none &s;uperior to that Dialogue between <HI>Sylvia</HI> and <HI>Dorinda,</HI> written by one of my own Sex; where all our little Weakne&s;&s;es are laid open in a Manner more ju&s;t, and with truer Raillery, than ever Man yet hit upon.</P>

<P>A Kin&s;man has &s;ent me a Letter, wherein he informs me, He had lately re&s;olved to write an Heroick Poem; but by Bu&s;ine&s;s has been interrupted, and has only made one Simi|litude, which he &s;hould be afflicted to have wholly lo&s;t, and begs of me to apply it to &s;ome|thing, being very de&s;irous to &s;ee it well placed in the World. I am &s;o willing to help the Di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed, that I have taken it in: But though his greater Genius might very well di&s;tingui&s;h his Ver&s;es from mine, I have marked where his begin. His Lines are a De&s;cription of the Sun in Eclip&s;e, which I know nothing more like than a brave Man in Sorrow, who bears it as he &s;hould, without imploring the Pity of his Friends, or being dejected with the Contempt of his Enemies: As in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Cato:</HI></P>
<Q><L>When all the Globe to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Fortune bow'd,</L>
<L><HI>Cato</HI> alone his Empire di&s;allow'd;</L>
<L><PB N="78" REF="83">
With Inborn Strength alone oppos'd Mankind,</L>
<L>With Heav'n in View, to all below it blind:</L>
<L>Regardle&s;s of his Friend's Applau&s;e, or Moan,</L>
<L>Alone Triumphant, &s;ince he falls alone.</L></Q>
<Q>

<L>' Thus when the Ruler of the Genial Day,</L>
<L>' Behind &s;ome dark'ning Planet forms his Way,</L>
<L>' De&s;ponding Mortals, with officious Care,</L>
<L>' The Concave Drum, and Magick Bra&s;s pre|pare;</L>
<L>' Implore him to &s;u&s;tain th'important Fight,</L>
<L>' And &s;ave depending Worlds from endle&s;s Night.</L>
<L>' Fondly they hope their Labour may avail,</L>
<L>' To ea&s;e his Conflict, and a&s;&s;i&s;t his Toil.</L>
<L>' Whil&s;t he in Beams of Native Splendor bright</L>
<L>' (Tho' dark his Orb appear to Humane Sight)</L>
<L>' Shines to the Gods with more diffu&s;ive Light.</L>
<L>' To di&s;tant Stars with equal Glory burns,</L>
<L>' Inflames their Lamps, and feeds their Gol|den Urns.</L>
<L>' Sure to retain his known &s;uperior Tract,</L>
<L>' And proves the more illu&s;trious by Defect.</L></Q>
<P>This is a very lively Image; but I mu&s;t take the Liberty to &s;ay, My Kin&s;man drives the Sun a little like <HI>Phaeton:</HI> He has all the Warmth of <HI>Phaebus,</HI> but won't &s;tay for his Direction of it. <HI>Avail</HI> and <HI>Toil, Defect</HI> and <HI>Tract,</HI> will ne|ver do for Rhimes. But however, he has the true Spirit in him; for which Rea&s;on I was wil|ling to entertain any Thing he pleas'd to &s;end me. The Subject which he writes upon, naturally rai&s;es great Reflections in the Soul, and puts us in Mind of the mixed Condition which we Mortals are to &s;upport; which, as it varies to Good or Bad, adorns or defaces our Actions to the Beholders: All which Glory and Shame mu&s;t end in what we &s;o much repine at, Death. But Doctrines on
<PB N="79" REF="84">
this Occa&s;ion, any other than that of living well, are the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant and mo&s;t empty of all the Labours of Men. None but a Tragedian can die by Rule, and wait till he di&s;covers a Plot, or &s;ays a fine Thing upon his <HI>Exit.</HI> In real Life, this is a Chimaera; and by Noble Spi|rits, it will be done decently, without the O|&s;tentation of it. We &s;ee Men of all Conditions and Characters go through it with equal Re&s;o|lution: And if we con&s;ider the Speeches of the mighty Philo&s;ophers, Heroes, Law-givers, and Great Captains, they can produce no more in a di&s;cerning Spirit, than Rules to make a Man a Fop on his Death-Bed. Commend me to that natural Greatne&s;s of Soul, expre&s;&s;ed by an in|nocent, and con&s;equently re&s;olute Country Fel|low, who &s;aid in the Pains of the Cholick, <HI>If I once get this Breath out of my Body, you &s;hall hang me before you put it in again.</HI> Hone&s;t <HI>Ned.</HI> and &s;o he died.</P>
<P>But it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, from this Place you may expect an Account of &s;uch a Thing as a New Play is not to be omitted. That acted this Night is the newe&s;t that ever was writ. The Au|thor is my ingenious Friend Mr. <HI>Thomas D&mdash;y.</HI> This Drama is called, <HI>The Modern Prophets,</HI> and is a mo&s;t unan&s;werable Satyr again&s;t the late Spirit of Enthu&s;ia&s;m. The Writer had by long Experience ob&s;erved, That in Company, very grave Di&s;cour&s;es have been followed by Baw|dry; and therefore has turned the Humour that Way with great Succe&s;s, and taken from his Audience all Manner of Super&s;tition, by the A|gitations of pretty Mrs. <HI>Bignall,</HI> whom he has, with great Subtilty, made a Lay-Si&s;ter, as well as a Prophete&s;s; by which Means, &s;he carries on the Affairs of both Worlds with great Suc|ce&s;s. My Friend de&s;igns to go on with another Work again&s;t Winter, which he intends to call,
<PB N="80" REF="85">
<HI>The Modern Poets;</HI> a People no le&s;s mi&s;taken in their Opinions of being in&s;pired, than the other. In order to this, he has by him &s;everal Songs, be&s;ides many Ambiguities, which cannot be mi|&s;taken for any Thing but what he means them. Mr. <HI>D&mdash;y</HI> generally writes State-Plays, and is wonderfully u&s;eful to the World in &s;uch Repre|&s;entations. This Method is the &s;ame that was us'd by the Old <HI>Athenians,</HI> to laugh out of Counte|nance, or promote Opinions among the People. My Friend has therefore, again&s;t this Play is acted for his own Benefit, made Two Dances, which may be al&s;o of an univer&s;al Benefit. In the Fir&s;t, he has repre&s;ented Ab&s;olute Power in the Per|&s;on of a Tall Man with an Hat and Feather, who gives his Fir&s;t Mini&s;ter, that &s;tands ju&s;t be|fore him, an huge Kick; the Mini&s;ter gives the Kick to the next before; and &s;o to the End of the Stage. In the Moral and Practical Je&s;t, you are made to under&s;tand, That there is, in an Ab&s;olute Government, no Gratification, but giving the Kick you receive from one above you, to one below you. This is performed to a grave and melancholy Air; but on a &s;udden the Tune moves quicker, and the whole Company fall into a Circle, and take Hands; then at a certain &s;harp Note, they move round, and kick as kick can. This latter Performance he makes to be the Repre&s;entation of a Free State; where, if you all mind your Steps, you may go round and round very jollily, with a Motion plea&s;ant to your &s;elves and tho&s;e you dance with: Nay, if you put your &s;elves out, at the wor&s;t you only kick and are kicked, like Friends and Equals.</P>

The De&s;cen|dants from <HI>Long&s;taff,</HI> the &s;econd Son, were a raki&s;h di&s;orderly Sort of People, and rambled from one Place to another, till in <HI>Harry II.</HI>'s Time they &s;ettled in <HI>Kent,</HI> and were called <HI>Long-Tails,</HI> from the <HI>Long-Tails</HI> which were &s;ent them as a Puni&s;hment for the Murder of <HI>Thomas a Becket,</HI> as the Legends &s;ay. They have been always &s;eeked after by the Ladies; but whether it be to &s;how their Aver&s;ion to Popery, or their Love to Miracles, I can't &s;ay. The <HI>Wag&s;taffs</HI> are a merry thought|le&s;s Sort of People, who have always been opinio|nated of their own Wit; they have turned them|&s;elves mo&s;tly to Poetry. This is the mo&s;t numerous Branch of our Family, and the poore&s;t. The <HI>Quar|ter&s;taffs</HI> are mo&s;t of them Prize-fighters, or Deer|&s;tealers: There have been &s;o many of them hanged lately, that there are very few of that Branch of our Family left. The <HI>White&s;taffs</HI> are all Courtiers, and have had very con&s;iderable Places. There have been &s;ome of them of that Strength and Dex|terity. That Five hundred of the able&s;t Men in the Kingdom have often tugged in vain to pull a Staff out of their Hands. The <HI>Fal&s;taffs</HI> are &s;trangely given to Whoring and Drinking: There are Abun|dance of them in and about <HI>London.</HI> And one Thing is very remarkable of this Branch, and that
<PB N="83" REF="88">
is, There are ju&s;t as many Women as Men in it. There was a wicked Stick of Wood of this Name in <HI>Harry IV.</HI>'s Time, one Sir <HI>John Fal&s;taff.</HI> As for <HI>Tip&s;taff,</HI> the younge&s;t Son, he was an hone&s;t Fel|low; but his Sons, and his Sons Sons, have all of them been the verie&s;t Rogues living: 'Tis this un|lucky Branch has &s;tock'd the Nation with that Swarm of Lawyers, Attorneys, Serjeants, and Bai|liffs, with which the Nation is over-run. <HI>Tip|&s;taff,</HI> being a Seventh Son, u&s;ed to cure the <HI>King's-Evil;</HI> but his ra&s;cally De&s;cendants are &s;o far from having that healing Quality, that by a Touch upon the Shoulder, they give a Man &s;uch an ill Habit of Body, that he can never come abroad af|terwards. This is all I know of the Line of <HI>Ja|cob&s;taff:</HI> His younger Brother <HI>I&s;aac&s;taff,</HI> as I told you before, had Five Sons, and was married twice; his Fir&s;t Wife was a <HI>Staff,</HI> (for they did not &s;tand upon fal&s;e Heraldry in tho&s;e Days) by whom he had one Son, who in Proce&s;s of Time being a School-ma|&s;ter, and well read in the <HI>Greek,</HI> called him&s;elf <HI>Di&s;taff</HI> or <HI>Twice&s;taff.</HI> He was not very rich, &s;o he put his Children out to Trades; and the <HI>Di&s;taffs</HI> have ever &s;ince been employed in the Woollen and Linen Manufactures, except my &s;elf, who am a Genealogi&s;t. <HI>Pike&s;taff,</HI> the elde&s;t Son by the Se|cond Venter, was a Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s, a downright plodding Fellow, and withal &s;o plain, that he be|came a Proverb. Mo&s;t of this Family are at pre|&s;ent in the Army. <HI>Ragged&s;taff</HI> was an unlucky Boy, and u&s;ed to tear his Clothes a getting Birds Ne&s;ts, and was always playing with a tame Bear his Father kept. <HI>Mop&s;taff</HI> fell in love with one of his Father's Maids, and u&s;ed to help her to clean the Hou&s;e. <HI>Broom&s;taff</HI> was a Chimney-Sweeper. The <HI>Mop&s;taffs</HI> and <HI>Broom&s;taffs</HI> are naturally as civil People as ever went out of Doors; but alas! If they once get into ill Hands, they knock down all before them. <HI>Pilgrim&s;taff</HI> run away from his

Friends, and went &s;trolling about the Country: And <HI>Pipe&s;taff</HI> was a Wine-Cooper. The&s;e Two were the unlawful I&s;&s;ue of <HI>Long&s;taff.</HI></P>

<P>You are to under&s;tand, Sir, That Simplicity of Behaviour, which is the Perfection of good Breeding and good Sen&s;e, is utterly lo&s;t in the World; and in the Room of it, there are &s;tarted a Thou&s;and little Inventions, which Men, barren of better Things, take up in the Place of it. Thus for every Character in Con|ver&s;ation that u&s;ed to plea&s;e, there is an Impo|&s;tor put upon you. Him whom we allow'd for|merly for a certain plea&s;ant Subtilty, and natu|ral Way of giving you an unexpected Hit, cal|led a <HI>Droll,</HI> is now mimick'd by a <HI>Biter,</HI> who is a dull Fellow, that tells you a Lye with a grave Face, and laughs at you for knowing him no better than to believe him. In&s;tead of that Sort of Companion, who could rally you, and keep his Countenance, till he made you fall
<PB N="88" REF="93">
into &s;ome little Incon&s;i&s;tency of Behaviour, at which you your &s;elf could laugh with him, you have the Sneerer, who will keep you Company from Morning to Night, to gather your Follies of the Day, (which perhaps you commit out of Confidence in him) and expo&s;e you in the Even|ing to all the Scorners in Town. For your Man of Sen&s;e and free Spirit, who&s;e Set of Thoughts were built upon Learning, Rea&s;on, and Expe|rience, you have now an impudent Creature made up of Vice only, who &s;upports his Igno|rance by his Courage, and Want of Learning by Contempt of it.</P>

<P>Dear Sir, hold: What you have told me already of this Change in Conver&s;ation, is too mi&s;erable to be heard with any Delight; but, methinks, as the&s;e new Creatures appear in the World, it might give an excellent Field to Wri|ters for the Stage, to divert us with the Repre|&s;entation of them there.</P>

<P>No, No: As you &s;ay, there might be &s;ome Hopes of Redre&s;s of the&s;e Grievances, if there were proper Care taken of the Theatre; but the Hi&s;tory of that is yet more lamentable, than that of the Decay of Conver&s;ation I gave you.</P>

<P>It is now &s;ome Years, &s;ince &s;everal Revolutions in the Gay World had made the Empire of the Stage &s;ubject to very fatal Con|vul&s;ions, which were too dangerous to be cured by the Skill of little King <HI>Oberon,</HI> who then &s;ate in the Throne of it. The Lazine&s;s of this Prince threw him upon the Choice of a Per&s;on who was fit to &s;pend his Life in Contentions, an able and profound Attorney, to whom he mort|gaged his whole Empire. This <HI>Divite</HI> is the mo&s;t skilful of all Politicians: He has a perfect
<PB N="89" REF="94">
Art in being unintelligible in Di&s;cour&s;e, and un|comeatable in Bu&s;ine&s;s. But he having no Un|der&s;tanding in this polite Way, brought in upon us, to get in his Money, Ladder-dancers, Rope-dancers, Jugglers, and Mountebanks, to &s;trut in the Place of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Heroes, and <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s Humouri&s;ts. When the Seat of Wit was thus mortgaged, without Equity of Redemption, an Architect aro&s;e, who has built the Mu&s;e a new Palace, but &s;ecured her no Retinue; &s;o that in|&s;tead of Action there, we have been put off by Song and Dance. This latter Help of Sound has al&s;o began to fail for want of Voices; there|fore the Palace has &s;ince been put into the Hands of a Surgeon, who cuts any Foreign Fellow in|to an Eunuch, and pa&s;&s;es him upon us for a Singer of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>

<P>Things are come to this Pa&s;s; and yet the World will not under&s;tand, that the Theatre has much the &s;ame Effect on the Manners of the Age, as the Bank on the Credit of the Na|tion. Wit and Spirit, Humour and good Sen&s;e, can never be revived, but under the Government of tho&s;e who are Judges of &s;uch Talents, who know, that whatever is put up in their Stead, is but a &s;hort and trifling Expedient, to &s;up|port the Appearance of them for a Sea&s;on. It is po&s;&s;ible, a Peace will give Lei&s;ure to put the&s;e Matters under new Regulations; but at pre|&s;ent all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance we can &s;ee towards our Recovery, is as far from giving us Help, as a Poultice is from performing what can be done only by the Grand Elixir.</P>

<P>MUch Hurry and Bu&s;ine&s;s had to Day per|plex'd me into a Mood too thoughtful for going into Company; for which Rea&s;on, in &s;tead of the Tavern, I went into <HI>Lincoln's Inn-Walks;</HI> and having taken a Round or Two, I &s;ate down, according to the allowed Familia|rity of the&s;e Places, on a Bench; at the other End of which &s;ate a venerable Gentleman, who &s;peaking with a very affable Air, <HI>Mr.</HI> Bicker|&s;taff, &s;aid he, <HI>I take it for a very great Piece of good Fortune that you have found me out. Sir,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>I had never, that I know of, the Honour of &s;eeing you before. That,</HI> replied he, <HI>is what I have often lamented; but I a&s;&s;ure you, I have for many Years done you good Offices, without being ob&s;erved by you; or el&s;e, when you had any little Glimp&s;e of my being concerned in an Affair, you have fled from me, and &s;hunned me like an Ene|my; but however, the Part I am to act in the World is &s;uch, that I am to go on in doing Good, though I meet with never &s;o many Repul&s;es, even from tho&s;e I oblige.</HI> This, thought I, &s;hows a great good Nature, but little Judgment in the Per&s;ons upon whom he confers his Favours. He immediately took Notice to me, That he ob&s;er|ved by my Countenance I thought him indi&s;creet in his Beneficence, and proceeded to tell me his Quality in the following Manner: <HI>I know thee,</HI> I&s;aac, <HI>to be &s;o well vers'd in the Occult Sciences, that I need not much Preface, or make long Pre|parations to gain you Faith that there are Airy Beings, who are employed in the Care and Atten|dance</HI>

<HI>of Men, as Nur&s;es are to Infants, till they come to an Age in which they can act-of them&s;elves. The&s;e Beings are u&s;ually called among&s;t Men,</HI> Guar|dian Angels; <HI>and, Mr.</HI> Bicker&s;taff, <HI>I am to ac|quaint you, that I am to be yours for &s;ome Time to come; it being our Orders to vary our Stations, and &s;ometimes to have me Pationt under our Pro|tection, and &s;ometimes another, with a Power of a&s;&s;uming what Shape we plea&s;e, to en&s;uare our Words unto their own Good. I have of late been upon &s;uch hard Duty, and know you have &s;o much Work for me, that I think fit to appear to you Face to Face, to de&s;ire you would give me as little Oc|ca&s;ion for Vigilance as you can. Sir,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>it will be a great In&s;truction to me in my Behaviour, if you plea&s;e to give me &s;ome Account of your late Employments, and what Hard&s;hips or Satisfactions you have had in them, that I may govern my &s;elf accordingly.</HI> He an&s;wered: To give you an Ex|ample of the Drudgery we go through, I will entertain you only with my Three la&s;t Stations: I was on the Fir&s;t of <HI>April</HI> la&s;t put to mortifie a great Beauty, with whom I was a Week; from her I went to a common Swearer, and have been la&s;t with a Game&s;ter. When I fir&s;t came to my Lady, I found my great Work was to guard well her Eyes and Ears, but her Flatte|rers were &s;o numerous, and the Hou&s;e, after the modern Way, &s;o full of Looking-gla&s;&s;es, that I &s;eldom had her &s;afe but in her Sleep. When|ever we went Abroad, we were &s;urrounded by an Army of Enemies: When a well-made Man appeared, he was &s;ure to have a Side-glance of Ob&s;ervation: If a di&s;agreeable Fellow, he had a full Face, out of meer Inclination to Con|que&s;ts. But at the Clo&s;e of the Evening, on the Sixth of the la&s;t Month, my Ward was fit|ting on a Couch, reading <HI>Ovid's Epi&s;tles;</HI> and as &s;he came to this Line of <HI>Helen</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI>
<Q><PB N="95" REF="102">
<L>She half con&s;ents who &s;ilently denies;</L></Q>
enter'd <HI>Philander,</HI> who is the mo&s;t skilful of all Men in an Addre&s;s to Women. He is arri|ved at the Perfection of that Art which gains them, which is, <HI>To talk like a very mi&s;erable Man, but look like a very happy One.</HI> I &s;aw <HI>Dictinna</HI> blu&s;h at his Entrance, which gave me the Alarm; but he immediately &s;aid &s;omething &s;o agreeable on her being at Study, and the No|velty of finding a Lady employed in &s;o grave a Manner, that he on a &s;udden became very fami|liarly a Man of no Con&s;equence; and in an In|&s;tant laid all her Su&s;picions of his Skill a&s;leep, as he almo&s;t had done mine, till I ob&s;erved him very dangerou&s;ly turn his Di&s;cour&s;e upon the Elegance of her Dre&s;s, and her Judgment in the Choice of that very pretty Mourning. Having had Women before under my Care, I trembled at the Apprehen&s;ion of a Man of Sen&s;e who could talk upon Trifles, and re&s;olved to &s;tick to my Po&s;t with all the Circum&s;pection imaginable. In &s;hort, I prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her again&s;t all he could &s;ay to the Advantage of her Dre&s;s and Per&s;on; but he turned again the Di&s;cour&s;e, where I found I had no Power o ver her, on the abu&s;ing her Friends and Acquaintance. He allowed in|deed, That <HI>Flora</HI> had a little Beauty, and a great deal of Wit; but then &s;he was &s;o ungainly in her Behaviour, and &s;uch a laughing <HI>Hoyden&mdash;Pa&s;torella</HI> had with him the Allowance of being Blamele&s;s: But what was that towards being Prai&s;e-worthy? To be only Innocent, is not to be Virtuous. He afterwards &s;poke &s;o much a|gain&s;t Mrs. <HI>Dipple</HI>'s Forehead, Mrs. <HI>Prim</HI>'s Mouth, Mrs. <HI>Dentifrice</HI>'s Teeth, and Mrs. <HI>Fidget</HI>'s Cheeks, that &s;he grew downright in Love with him: For it is always to be under&s;tood, That a Lady takes all you detract from the re&s;t of her Sex to
<PB N="96" REF="103">
be a Gift to her. In a Word, Things went &s;o far, that I was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and &s;he will remem|ber that Evening Nine Months, from the Sixth of <HI>April,</HI> by a very remarkable Token. The next, as I &s;aid, I went to was a common Swea|rer: Never was a Creature &s;o puzzled as my &s;elf when I came fir&s;t to view his Brain; half of it was worn out, and filled up with meer Exple|tives, that had nothing to do with any other Parts of the Texture; therefore, when he cal|led for his Clothes in a Morning, he would cry, <HI>John?&mdash;John</HI> does not an&s;wer. <HI>What a Plague! No Body there? What the Devil, and rot me!</HI> John, <HI>for a laxy Dog as you are.</HI> I knew no Way to cure him, but by writing down all he &s;aid one Morning as he was dre&s;&s;ing, and lay|ing it before him on the Toilet when he came to pick his Teeth. The la&s;t Recital I gave him of what he &s;aid for half an Hour before, was, <HI>What, a Pox rot me! Where is the Wa&s;hball? Call the Chairmen: Damn 'em, I warrant they are at the Alehou&s;e already! Zounds, and Con|found 'em.</HI> When he came to the Gla&s;s, he takes up my Note&mdash;<HI>Ha! This Fellow is wor&s;e than me: What, Does he &s;wear with Pen and Ink?</HI> But reading on, he found them to be his own Words. The Stratagem had &s;o good an Effect upon him, that he grew immediately a new Man, and is learning to &s;peak without an Oath, which makes him extremely &s;hort in his Phra&s;es; for, as I ob&s;erved before, a Common Swearer has a Brain without any Idea on the Swearing Side; therefore my Ward has yet mighty little to &s;ay, and is forced to &s;ub&s;titute &s;ome other Vehicle of Non&s;ence to &s;upply the Defect of his u&s;ual Expletives. When I left him, he made U&s;e of, <HI>Odsbodikins! Oh me!</HI> and <HI>Never &s;tir alive!</HI> and &s;o forth; which gave me the Hopes of his Recovery. So I went to the next I told you of,
<PB N="97" REF="104">
the Game&s;ter. When we fir&s;t take our Place about a Man, the Receptacles of the <HI>Pericra|nium</HI> are immediately &s;earched. In his, I found no one ordinary Trace of Thinking; but &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ion, violent De&s;ires, and a continued Series of different Changes, had torn it to Pieces. There appeared no middle Condition; the Tri|umph of a Prince, or the Mi&s;ery of a Beggar, were his alternate States. I was with him no longer than one Day, which was Ye&s;terday. In the Morning at Twelve, we were worth Four Thou&s;and Pounds; at Three, we were arrived at Six Thou&s;and; half an Hour after, we were reduced to One Thou&s;and; at Four of the Clock we were down to Two Hundred; at Five, to Fifty; at Six, to Five; at Seven, to One Gui|nea; the next Bet, to Nothing. This Morning, he borrowed Half a Crown of the Maid who cleans his Shoes; and is now gaming in <HI>Lin|colns-Inn-Fields</HI> among the Boys for Farthings and Oranges, till he has made up Three Pieces, and then he returns to <HI>White</HI>'s into the be&s;t Company in Town. This ended our fir&s;t Di&s;|cour&s;e; and it is hoped, you will forgive me that I have picked &s;o little out of my Compa|nion at our fir&s;t Interview. In the next, 'tis po&s;&s;ible he may tell me more plea&s;ing Incidents; for though he is a Familiar, he is not an Evil Spirit.</P>

but the Methods of the Treaty will be publickly known. In the mean Time, the States have declared an Abhorrence of making any Step in this great Affair, but in Concert with the Court of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and other Princes of the Alliance. The Po&s;ture of Affairs in <HI>Franes</HI> does nece&s;&s;arily oblige that Nation to be very much in Earne&s;t in their Offers; and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Torcy</HI> hath profe&s;&s;ed to the Grand Pen&s;ioner, That he will avoid all Occa&s;ions of giving him the lea&s;t Jealou&s;ie of his u&s;ing any Addre&s;s in private Conver&s;ations for accompli&s;hing the Ends of his Emba&s;&s;y. It is &s;aid, That as &s;oon as the Preliminaries are adju&s;ted, that Mini&s;ter is to return to the <HI>French</HI> Court.

The <HI>French</HI> Prote|&s;tants re&s;iding in that Country have applied them&s;elves to their re&s;pective Magi&s;trates, de&s;i|ring that there may be an Article in the Trea|ty of Peace, which may give Liberty of Con|&s;cience to the Prote&s;tants in <HI>France.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bo&s;nage,</HI> Mini&s;ter of the <HI>Walloon</HI> Church at <HI>Rot|terdam,</HI> has been at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and hath had &s;ome Conferences with the Deputies of the States on that Subject.

<P>HAD it not been that my Familiar had ap|peared to me, as I told you in my la&s;t, in Per&s;on, I had certainly been unable to have found even Words, without Meaning, to keep up my Intelligence with the Town: But he has checked me &s;everely for my De&s;pondence, and ordered me to go on in my De&s;ign of ob&s;erving upon Things, and forbearing Per&s;ons; for, &s;aid he, the Age you live in is &s;uch, that a good Pi|cture of any Vice or Virtue will infallibly be
<PB N="100" REF="107">
mi&s;repre&s;ented; and though none will take the kind De&s;criptions you make &s;o much to them|&s;elves, as to wi&s;h well to the Author, yet all will re&s;ent the ill Characters you produce, out of Fear of their own Turn in the Licence you mu&s;t be obliged to take, if you point at particu|lar Per&s;ons. I took his Admonition kindly, and immediately promi&s;ed him to beg Pardon of the Author of the <HI>Advice to the Poets,</HI> for my Rail|lery upon his Work; tho' I aimed at no more, in that Examination, but to convince him, and all Men of Genius, of the Folly of laying them|&s;elves out on &s;uch Plans as are below their Cha|racters. I hope too it was done without Ill-Breeding, and nothing &s;poken below what a Ci|vilian (as it is allowed I am) may utter to a Phy&s;ician. After this Preface, all the World may be &s;afe from my Writings; for if I can find nothing to commend, I am &s;ilent, and will for|bear the Subject: For, though I am a Reformer, I &s;corn to be an Inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>It would become all Men as well as me, to lay before 'em the noble Character of <HI>Verus</HI> the Magi&s;trate, who always &s;ate in Triumph over, and Contempt of Vice; He never &s;earched after it, or &s;pared it when it came before him: At the &s;ame Time, He could &s;ee thro' the Hypocri|&s;y and Di&s;gui&s;e of tho&s;e, who have no Pretence to Virtue them&s;elves, but by their Severity to the Vicious. This &s;ame <HI>Verus</HI> was, in Times long pa&s;t, Chief Ju&s;tice (as we call it among&s;t us) in <HI>Faelicia.</HI> He was a Man of profound Knowledge of the Laws of his Country, and as ju&s;t an Ob|&s;erver of 'em in his own Per&s;on. He con&s;idered Ju&s;tice as a Cardinal Virtue, not as a Trade for Maintenance. Wherever he was Judge, he ne|ver forgot that he was al&s;o Council. The Cri|minal before him was always &s;ure he &s;tood be|fore his Country, and, in a Sort, a Parent of it.
<PB N="101" REF="108">
The Pri&s;oner knew, that tho' his Spirit was bro|ken with Guilt, and incapable of Language to defend it &s;elf, all would be gathered from him which could conduce to his Safety; and that his Judge would wre&s;t no Law to de&s;troy him, nor conceal any that could &s;ave him. In his Time, there were a Ne&s;t of Pretenders to Ju&s;tice, who happen'd to be employed to put Things in a Me|thod for being examined before him at his u&s;ual Se&s;&s;ions: The&s;e Animals were to <HI>Verus,</HI> as Mon|keys are to Men, &s;o like, that you can hardly di&s;own them; but &s;o ba&s;e, that you are a&s;hamed of their Fraternity. It grew a Phra&s;e, <HI>Who would do Ju&s;tice on the Ju&s;tices?</HI> That certainly would <HI>Verus.</HI> I have &s;een an old Trial where he &s;ate Judge on Two of 'em; one was called <HI>Trick-Track,</HI> the other <HI>Tear&s;hift;</HI> one was a learned Judge of Sharpers, the other the quicke&s;t of all Men at finding out a Wench. <HI>Trick-Track</HI> never &s;pared a Pick-pocket, but was a Companion to Cheats: <HI>Tear&s;hift</HI> would make Compliments to Wenches of Quality, but certainly commit poor ones. If a poor Rogue wanted a Lodging, <HI>Trick-Track</HI> &s;ent him to Gaol for a Thief: If a poor Whore went only with one thin Petticoat, <HI>Tear|&s;hift</HI> would impri&s;on her for being loo&s;e in her Dre&s;s. The&s;e Patriots infe&s;ted the Days of <HI>Ve|rus,</HI> while they alternately committed and relea|&s;ed each others Pri&s;oners. But <HI>Verus</HI> regarded them as Criminals, and always look'd upon Men as they &s;tood in the Eye of Ju&s;tice, without re|&s;pecting whether they &s;ate on the Bench, or &s;tood at the Bar.</P>

<P>Ye&s;terday we were entertained with the Tra|gedy of <HI>The Earl of E&s;&s;ex,</HI> in which there is not one good Line, and yet a Play which was never &s;een without drawing Tears from &s;ome Part of the Audience: A remarkable In&s;tance, that the
<PB N="102" REF="109">
Soul is not to be moved by Words, but Things for the Incidents in this <HI>Drama</HI> are laid together &s;o happily, that the Spectator makes the Play for him&s;elf, by the Force which the Circum&s;tance has upon his Imagination. Thus, in &s;pight of the mo&s;t dry Di&s;cour&s;es, and Expre&s;&s;ions almo&s;t ri|diculous with re&s;pect to Propriety, it is impo&s;|&s;ible for one unprejudic'd to &s;ee it untouch'd with Pity. I mu&s;t confe&s;s this Effect is not wrought on &s;uch as examine why they are plea&s;ed; but it never fails to appear on tho&s;e who are not too learned in Nature, to be moved by her fir&s;t Sugge&s;tions. It is certain, the Per|&s;on and Behaviour of Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> has no &s;mall Share in conducing to the Popularity of the Play; and when an hand&s;ome Fellow is going to a more cour&s;e <HI>Exit</HI> than Beheading, his Shape and Countenance makes every tender one re|prieve him with all her Heart, without waiting till &s;he hears his dying Words.</P>
<P>This Evening <HI>The Alchymi&s;t</HI> was played. This Comedy is an Example of <HI>Ben</HI>'s exten&s;ive Ge|nius and Penerration into the Pa&s;&s;ions and Fol|lies of Mankind. The Scene in the Fourth Act, where all the cheated People oppo&s;e the Man that would open their Eyes, has &s;omething in it &s;o inimitably excellent, that it is certainly as great a Ma&s;ter-piece as has ever appeared by any Hand. The Author's great Addre&s;s in &s;howing Covetou&s;ne&s;s the Motive of the Actions of the <HI>Puritan,</HI> the <HI>Epicure,</HI> the <HI>Game&s;ter,</HI> and the <HI>Tra|der;</HI> that all their Endeavours, how differently &s;oever they &s;eem to tend, center only in that one Point of Gain, &s;hows he had to a great Perfection that Di&s;cernment of Spirit, which con&s;titutes a Genius for Comedy.</P>

Deceit in the Pur&s;uit of what we wi&s;h for. A Gentleman here this Evening was giving me an Account of a dumb Fortune-Teller, who out|does Mr. <HI>Partridge,</HI> my &s;elf, or the Unborn-Doctor, for Predictions. All his Vi&s;itants come to him full of Expectations, and pay his own Rate for the Interpretations they put upon his Shrugs and Nods. There is a fine rich City-Widow &s;tole thither the other Day, (though it is not Six Weeks &s;ince her Husband's Departure from her Company to re&s;t) and, with her tru&s;ty Maid, demanded of him, Whether &s;he &s;hould marry again, by holding up Two Fingers, like Horns on her Forehead. The Wizard held up both her Hands forked. The Relict de&s;ired to know, Whether he meant by his holding up both Hands, to repre&s;ent that &s;he had one Hu&s;|band before, and that &s;he &s;hould have another? Or that he intimated, &s;he &s;hould have Two more? The Cunning Man look'd a little &s;our; upon which <HI>Betty</HI> jogged her Mi&s;tre&s;s, who gave t'other Guinea; and he made her under&s;tand, She &s;hould po&s;itively have Two more; but &s;ha|ked his Head, and hinted, that they &s;hould not live long with her. The Widow &s;ighed, and gave him t'other half Guinea. After this Prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, all that &s;he had next to do, was to make Sallies to our End of the Town, and find out who it is her Fate to have. There are Two who frequent this Place, whom &s;he takes for Men of Vogue, and of whom her Imagination has given her the Choice. They are both the Appearances of fine Gentlemen, to &s;uch as do not know when they &s;ee Per&s;ons of that Turn; and indeed, they are indu&s;trious enough to come at that Chara|cter, to de&s;erve the Reputation of being &s;uch. But this Town will not allow us to be the Thing we &s;eem to aim at, and are too di&s;cerning to be fobb'd off with Pretences. One of the&s;e pretty
<PB N="104" REF="111">
Fellows fails by his laborious Exactne&s;s; the o|ther, by his as much &s;tudied Negligence. <HI>Frank Carele&s;s,</HI> as &s;oon as his Valet has helped on and adju&s;ted his Clothes, goes to his Gla&s;s, &s;ets his Wig awry, tumbles his Cravat; and in &s;hort, undre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to go into Company. <HI>Will Nice</HI> is &s;o little &s;atisfied with his Dre&s;s, that all the Time he is at a Vi&s;it, he is &s;till mending it, and is for that Rea&s;on the more in&s;ufferable; for he who &s;tudies Carele&s;ne&s;s, has, at lea&s;t, his Work the &s;ooner done of the Two. The Widow is di&s;tracted whom to take for her fir&s;t Man; for <HI>Nice</HI> is every Way &s;o careful, that &s;he fears his Length of Days; and <HI>Frank</HI> is &s;o loo&s;e, that &s;he has Apprehen&s;ions for her own Health with him. I am puzzled how to give a ju&s;t Idea of them; but in a Word, <HI>Carele&s;s</HI> is a Cox|comb, and <HI>Nice</HI> a Fop: Both, you'll &s;ay, very hopeful Candidates for a gay Woman ju&s;t &s;et at Liberty. But there is a Whi&s;per, her Maid will give her to <HI>Tom Terrour</HI> the Game&s;ter. This Fel|low has undone &s;o many Women, that he'll cer|tainly &s;ucceed if he is introduced; for nothing &s;o much prevails with the vain Part of that Sex, as the Glory of deceiving them who have de|ceived others.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>May 12.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have taken a Re&s;olution hereafter, on any Want of Intelligence, to carry my Familiar abroad with me, who has promi&s;ed to give me very proper and ju&s;t Notices of Per&s;ons and Things, to make up the Hi&s;tory of the pa&s;&s;ing Day. He is wonderfully skilful in the Know|ledge of Men and Manners, which has made me more than ordinary curious to know how he came to that Perfection, and I communicated to him that Doubt. Mr. <HI>Pacolet,</HI> &s;aid I, I am migh|tily &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee you &s;o good a Judge of our Nature and Circum&s;tances, &s;ince you are a meer Spirit, and have no Knowledge of the Bodily Parts of us. He an&s;wered, &s;miling, You are mi|&s;taken, I have been one of you, and lived a Month among&s;t you, which gives me an exact Sen&s;e of your Condition. You are to know, That all who enter into Humane Life, have a certain Date or <HI>Stamen</HI> given to their Being,
<PB N="107" REF="114">
which they only who die of Age may be &s;aid to have arrived at; but it is ordered &s;ometimes by Fate, that &s;uch as die Infants, are after Death to attend Mankind to the End of that <HI>Stamen</HI> of Being in them&s;elves, which was broke off by Sickne&s;s or any other Di&s;after. The&s;e are proper Guardians to Men, as being in&s;en&s;ible of the Infirmity of their State. You are Philo&s;opher enough to know, that the Difference of Men's Under&s;tanding proceeds only from the various Di&s;po&s;itions of their Organs; &s;o that he who dies at a Month old, is in the next Life as knowing (tho' more innocent) as they who live to Fifty; and after Death, they have as perfect a Memory and Judgment of all that pa&s;s'd in their Life-time, as I have of all the Revolutions in that unea&s;ie, turbulent Condition of yours; and, you'd &s;ay, I had enough of it in a Month, were I to tell you all my Misfortunes. A Life of a Month, can't have, one would think, much Variety; but pray, &s;aid I, let us have your Story.</P>
<P>Then he proceeds in the following Manner:</P>
<P>It was one of the mo&s;t wealthy Families in <HI>Great Britain</HI> into which I was born, and it was a very great Happine&s;s to me that it &s;o hap|pen'd, otherwi&s;e I had &s;till, in all Probability, been living: But I &s;hall recount to you all the Occurrences of my &s;hort and mi&s;erable Exi&s;tence, ju&s;t as, by examining into the Traces made in my Brain, they appeared to me at that Time. The fir&s;t Thing that ever &s;truck my Sen&s;es, was a Noi&s;e over my Head of one &s;hrieking; after which, methought I took a full Jump, and found my &s;elf in the Hands of a Sorcere&s;s, who &s;eem'd as if &s;he had been long waking, and em|ployed in &s;ome Incantation: I was throughly frightned, and cried out, but &s;he immediately &s;eem'd to go on in &s;ome Magical Operation, and
<PB N="108" REF="115">
anointed me from Head to Foot. What they meant, I could not imagine; for there gather'd a great Crowd about me, crying, <HI>An Heir, an Heir;</HI> upon which I grew a little &s;till, and be|lieved this was a Ceremony to be u&s;ed only to great Per&s;ons, and &s;uch as made them, what they call'd, <HI>Heirs.</HI> I lay very quiet; but the Witch, for no Manner of Rea&s;on or Provocation in the World, takes me and binds my Head as hard as po&s;&s;ibly &s;he could, then ties up both my Legs, and makes me &s;wallow down an horrid Mixture; I thought it an har&s;h Entrance into Life to begin with taking Phy&s;ick; but I was forced to it, or el&s;e mu&s;t have taken down a great In&s;trument in which &s;he gave it me. When I was thus dre&s;&s;ed, I was carried to a Bed-&s;ide, where a fine young Lady (my Mother I wot) had like to have hugg'd me to Death. From her, they faced me about, and there was a Thing with quite another Look from the re&s;t of the Room, to whom they talk'd about my No&s;e. He &s;eem'd wonderfully pleas'd to &s;ee me; but I knew &s;ince, my No&s;e belong'd to another Fa|mily. That into which I was born, is one of the mo&s;t numerous among&s;t you; therefore Crowds of Relations came every Day to congra|tulate my Arrival; among others, my Cou&s;in <HI>Betty,</HI> the greate&s;t Romp in Nature: She whisks me &s;uch a Height over her Head, that I cry'd out for fear of falling. She pinch'd me, and called me &s;quealing Chit, and threw me into a Girls Arms that was taken in to tend me. The Girl was very proud of the Womanly Employ|ment of a Nur&s;e, and took upon her to &s;trip and dre&s;s me a-new, becau&s;e I made a Noi&s;e, to &s;ee what ailed me: She did &s;o, and &s;tuck a Pin in every Joint about me. I &s;till cri|ed: Upon which, &s;he lays me on my Face in her Lap; and to quiet me, fell a nailing in all
<PB N="109" REF="116">
the Pins, by clapping me on the Back, and skreaming a Lullaby. But my Pain made me exalt my Voice above hers, which brought up the Nur&s;e, the Witch I fir&s;t &s;aw, and my Grandmother. The Girl is turn'd down Stairs, and I &s;tripp'd again, as well to find what ail'd me, as to &s;atisfy my Granam's further Curio&s;i|ty. This good old Woman's Vi&s;it was the Cau&s;e of all my Troubles. You are to under&s;tand, That I was hitherto bred by Hand, and any Body that &s;tood next, gave me Pap, if I did but open my Lips; in&s;omuch, that I was grown &s;o cunning, as to pretend my &s;elf a&s;leep when I was not, to prevent my being cramm'd. But my Grandmother began a loud Lecture upon the Idlene&s;s of the Wives of this Age, who, for Fear of their Shapes, forbear &s;uckling their own Off|&s;pring: And Ten Nur&s;es were immediately &s;ent for; one was whi&s;per'd to have a wanton Eye, and would &s;oon &s;poil her Milk; another was in a Con&s;umption; the Third had an ill Voice, and would frighten me, in&s;tead of lulling me to &s;leep. Such Exceptions were made again&s;t all but one Country Milch-Wench, to whom I was committed, and put to the Brea&s;t. This care|le&s;s Jade was eternally romping with the Foot|men, and downright &s;tarved me; in&s;omuch that I daily pined away, and &s;hould never have been reliev'd, had it not been, that on the Thirtieth Day of my Life, a Fellow of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> who had writ upon <HI>Cold Baths,</HI> came to vi&s;it me, and &s;olemnly prote&s;ted, I was utterly lo&s;t for want of that Method: Upon which he &s;ous'd me Head and Ears into a Pail of Water, where I had the good Fortune to be drowned, and &s;o e&s;cap'd be|ing la&s;h'd into a Lingui&s;t till Sixteen, running after Wenches till Twenty five, and being mar|ried to an ill natured Wife till Sixty: Which had certainly been my Fate, had not the Inchant|ment
<PB N="110" REF="117">
between Body and Soul been broke by this Philo&s;opher. Thus, till the Age I &s;hould have otherwi&s;e liv'd. I am oblig'd to watch the Steps of Men; and if you plea&s;e, &s;hall accompany you in your pre&s;ent Walks, and get you Intelligence from the Aerial Lacquey, who is in Waiting, what are the Thoughts and Purpo&s;es of any whom you enquire for. I accepted his kind Offer, and immediately took him with me in an Hack to <HI>White</HI>'s.</P>

<P>We got in hither, and my Companion threw a Powder round us, that made me as invi&s;i|ble as him&s;elf; &s;o that we could &s;ee and hear all others, our &s;elves un&s;een and un|heard.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing we took Notice of, was a Nobleman of a goodly and frank A&s;pect, with his generous Birth and Temper vi&s;ible in it, playing at Cards with a Creature of a black and horrid Countenance, wherein were plainly de|lineated the Arts of his Mind, Cou&s;enage and Fal&s;hood. They were marking their Game with Counters, on which we could &s;ee In&s;criptions, imperceptible to any but us. My Lord had &s;cor'd with Pieces of Ivory, on which were writ, <HI>Good Fame, Glory, Riches, Honour, and Po|&s;terity.</HI> The Spectre over-again&s;t him had on his Counters the In&s;criptions of <HI>Di&s;honour. Impu|dence, Poverty, Ignorance, and Want of Shame.</HI> Ble&s;s me! &s;aid I; Sure my Lord does not &s;ee what he plays for! As well as I do, &s;ays <HI>Pacolet.</HI> He de&s;pi&s;es that Fellow he plays with, and &s;corns him&s;elf for making him his Companion. At the very In&s;tant he was &s;peaking, I &s;aw the Fellow who play'd with my Lord, hide Two Cards in the Roll of his Stocking: <HI>Pacolet</HI> immediately &s;tole 'em from thence; upon which the Noble|man
<PB N="111" REF="118">
&s;oon after won the Game. The little Tri|umph he appeared in, when he got &s;uch a tri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ing Stock of ready Money, tho' he had ven|tured &s;o great Sums with Indifference, increas'd my Admiration. But <HI>Pacolet</HI> began to talk to me. Mr. <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> This to you looks wonderful, but not at all to us higher Beings: That Noble has as many good Qualities as any Man of his Order, and &s;eems to have no Faults but what, as I may &s;ay, are Excre&s;cencies from Virtues. He is Generous to a Prodigality, more Affable than is con&s;i&s;tent with his Quality, and Coura|gious to a Ra&s;hne&s;s. Yet, after all this, the Source of his whole Conduct is (tho' he would hate him&s;elf if he knew it) meer Avarice. The Ready Ca&s;h laid before the Game&s;ter's Counters makes him venture, as you &s;ee, and lay Di&s;tin|ction again&s;t Infamy, Abundance again&s;t Want; in a Word, all that's de&s;irable again&s;t all that's to be avoided. However, &s;aid I, be &s;ure you di&s;|appoint the Sharpers to Night, and &s;teal from 'em all the Cards they hide. <HI>Pacolet</HI> obey'd me, and my Lord went Home with their whole Bank in his Pocket.</P>

<P>To Night was acted a Second Time a Come|dy, call'd, <HI>The Bu&s;ie Body:</HI> This Play is written by a Lady. In old Times, we us'd to &s;it upon a Play here after it was acted; but now the En|tertainment is turn'd another Way; not but there are con&s;iderable Men appear in all Ages, who, for &s;ome eminent Quality or Invention, de&s;erve the E&s;teem and Thanks of the Publick. Such a Be|nefector is a Gentleman of this Hou&s;e, who is ob&s;erved by the Surgeons with much Envy; for he has invented an Engine for the Prevention of Harms by Love-Adventures, and by great Care and Application, hath made it an Immode&s;ty to name his Name. This Act of Self-denial has
<PB N="112" REF="119">
gain'd this worthy Member of the Common+wealth a great Reputation. Some Law-giver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> have departed from their Abodes for ever, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> commanded the Ob&s;ervation of their Laws til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> their Return; others have u&s;ed other Artifice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> to fly the Applau&s;e of their Merit; but this Per|&s;on &s;huns Glory with greater Addre&s;s, and has, by giving his Engine his own Name, made it ob&s;cene to &s;peak of him more. However, he is rank'd among, and receiv'd by the modern Wits, as a great Promoter of Gallantry and Plea&s;ure. But I fear, Plea&s;ure is le&s;s under|&s;tood in this Age, which &s;o much pretends to it, than in any &s;ince the Creation. 'Twas ad|mirably &s;aid of him who fir&s;t took Notice, That <HI>(Res e&s;t &s;evera Voluptas)</HI> there is a certain Seve|rity in Plea&s;ure. Without that, all Decency is bani&s;hed; and if Rea&s;on is not to be pre&s;ent at our greate&s;t Satisfactions, of all the Races of Creatures, the Humane is the mo&s;t mi&s;erable. It was not &s;o of old; when <HI>Virgil</HI> de&s;cribes a Wit, he always means a virtuous Man; and all his Sentiments of Men of Genius are &s;uch as &s;how Per&s;ons di&s;tingui&s;hed from the common Level of Mankind; &s;uch as placed Happine&s;s in the Contempt of low Fears, and mean Gratifi|cations: Fears, which we are &s;ubject to with the Vulgar; and Plea&s;ures, which we have in common with Bea&s;ts. With the&s;e illu&s;trious Per&s;onages, the wi&s;e&s;t Man was the greate&s;t Wit; and none was thought worthy of that Character, unle&s;s he an&s;wered this excellent De&s;cription of the Poet:</P>

<P>SIR <HI>Thomas,</HI> of this Hou&s;e, has &s;how'd me &s;ome Letters from the <HI>Bath,</HI> which give Accounts of what pa&s;&s;es among the good Com|pany of that Place; and allow'd me to tran|&s;cribe one of them, that &s;eems to be writ by &s;ome of Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>'s particular Acquaintance, and is as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Knight,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I De&s;ire you would give my humble Service to all our Friends, which I &s;peak of to you (out of Method) in the very Beginning of my Epi|&s;tle, le&s;t the pre&s;ent Di&s;orders, by which this Seat of Gallantry and Plea&s;ure is torn to Pieces, &s;hould make me forget it. You keep &s;o good Company, that you know <HI>Bath</HI> is &s;tock'd with &s;uch as come hither to be relieved from luxuri|ant Health, or imaginary Sickne&s;s, and con&s;e|quently is always as well &s;towed with Gallants as Invalids, who live together in a very good
<PB N="114" REF="121">
Under&s;tanding. But the Sea&s;on is &s;o early, that our fine Company is not yet arrived; and the Warm Bath, which in Heathen Times was dedi|cated to <HI>Venus,</HI> is now u&s;ed only by &s;uch as really want it for Health's Sake. There are however a good many Strangers, among whom are Two ambitious Ladies, who being both in the Au|tumn of their Life, take the Opportunity of placing them&s;elves at the Head of &s;uch as we are, before the <HI>Chloe's, Clari&s;&s;a's,</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;torella's</HI> come down. One of the&s;e Two is exce&s;&s;ively in Pain, that the ugly Being called <HI>Time</HI> will make Wrinkles in Spite of the Lead Forehead-Cloth; and therefore hides with the Gaiery of her Air, the Volubility of her Tongue, and Quickne&s;s of her Motion, the Injuries which it has done her. The other Lady is but Two Years behind her in Life, and dreads as much being laid a&s;ide as the former, and con&s;equent|ly has taken the nece&s;&s;ary Precautions to pre|vent her Reign over us. But &s;he is very di&s;|creet, and wonderfully turned for Ambition, being never apparently tran&s;ported either with Affectation or Malice. Thus, while <HI>Florimel</HI> is talking in Publick, and &s;preading her Graces in A&s;&s;emblies, to gain a Popular Dominion over our Diver&s;ions, <HI>Prudentia</HI> vi&s;its very cunningly all the Lame, the Splenatick, and the Superan|nuated, who have their di&s;tinct Cla&s;&s;es of Fol|lowers and Friends. Among the&s;e, &s;he has found that &s;ome Body has &s;ent down printed Certificates of <HI>Florimel</HI>'s Age, which &s;he has read and di&s;tributed to this unjoyful Set of Peo|ple, who are always Enemies to tho&s;e in Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the good Opinion of the Company. This unprovoked Injury done by <HI>Prudentia,</HI> was the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion of our fatal Divi&s;ions here, and a Declaration of War between the&s;e Rivals. <HI>Florimel</HI> has abundance of Wit, which &s;he has
<PB N="115" REF="122">
lavi&s;h'd in decrying <HI>Prudentia,</HI> and giving De|fiance to her little Arts. For an In&s;tance of her &s;uperior Power, &s;he be&s;poke the Play of <HI>Alex|ander the Great,</HI> to be acted by the Company of Strollers, and de&s;ired us all to be there on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> la&s;t. When &s;he &s;poke to me to come, <HI>As you are,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>a Lover, you will not fail the Death of</HI> Alexander: <HI>The Pa&s;&s;ion of Love is wonderfully hit&mdash;</HI>Statira! <HI>Oh that happy Woman&mdash;To have a Conqueror at her Feet&mdash;But you'll be &s;ure to be there.</HI> I, and &s;everal others, re&s;olv'd to be of her Party. But &s;ee the irre&s;i&s;tible Strength of that un&s;u&s;pected Crea|ture, a <HI>Silent Woman. Prudentia</HI> had counter|plotted us, and had be&s;poke on the &s;ame Even|ing the Popper-Show of <HI>The Creation of the World.</HI> She had engaged every Body to be there; and to turn our Leader into Ridicule, had &s;ecretly let 'em know, that the Poppet <HI>Eve</HI> was made the mo&s;t like <HI>Florimel</HI> that ever was &s;een. On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Morning the <HI>Poppet-Drum|mer, Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> and &s;everal others who lived before the Flood, pa&s;s'd thro' the Streets on Hor&s;eback, to invite us all to the Pa&s;time, and the Repre&s;entation of &s;uch Things as we all knew to be true; and Mr. Mayor was &s;o wi&s;e as to prefer the&s;e innocent People the Pop|pets, who, he &s;aid, were to repre&s;ent Chri&s;tians, before the wicked Players, who were to &s;how <HI>Alexander,</HI> an Heathen Philo&s;opher. To be &s;hort, this <HI>Prudentia</HI> had &s;o laid it, that at Ten of the Clock Footmen were &s;ent to take Places at the Poppet-Show, and all we of <HI>Florimel</HI>'s Party were to be out of Fa&s;hion, or de&s;ert her. We cho&s;e the latter. All the World crowded to <HI>Prudentia</HI>'s Hou&s;e, becau&s;e it was given out, no Body could get in. When we came to <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood in the Show, <HI>Punch</HI> and his Wife were introduced dan|cing in the Ark. An hone&s;t plain Friend of <HI>Flori|mel</HI>'s,
<PB N="116" REF="123">
but a Critick withal, ro&s;e up in the mid&s;t of the Repre&s;entation, and made many very good Exceptions to the <HI>Drama</HI> it &s;elf, and told us. That it was again&s;t all Morality, as well as Rules of the Stage, that <HI>Punch</HI> &s;hould be in Je&s;t in the De|luge, or indeed that he &s;hould appear at all. This was certainly a ju&s;t Remark, and I thought to &s;econd him; but he was hi&s;s'd by <HI>Prudentia</HI>'s Party; upon which, really, Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> we who were his Friends hi&s;s'd him too. Old Mrs. <HI>Petulent</HI> de&s;ired both her Daughters to mind the Moral; then whi&s;pered Mrs. Mayo|re&s;s, <HI>This is very proper for young People to &s;ee. Punch</HI> at the End of the Play made Madam <HI>Prudentia</HI> a Compliment, and was very civil to the whole Company, making Bows till his Buttons touch'd the Ground.

<P>I Have the Honour of a Letter from a Friend of yours, relating to an Incivility done to you at the Opera, by one of your own Sex; but I, who was an Eye-witne&s;s of the Accident, can te&s;tify to you, that tho' &s;he pre&s;&s;ed before you, &s;he lo&s;t her Ends in that De&s;ign; for &s;he was taken Notice of for no other Rea&s;on, but her Endeavours to hide a finer Woman than her &s;elf. But indeed, I dare not go further in this Matter, than ju&s;t this bare Mention; for though it was taking your Place of Right, rather than Place of Precedence, yet it is &s;o tender a Point, and on which the very Life of Female Am|bition depends, that it is of the la&s;t Con&s;e|quence to meddle in it: All my Hopes are from your beautiful Sex; and tho&s;e bright Eyes, which are the Bane of others, are my only Sun|&s;hine. My Writings are Sacred to you; and I hope, I &s;hall always have the good Fortune to live under your Protection; therefore take this publick Opportunity to &s;ignify to all the World, That I de&s;ign to forbear any Thing that may in the lea&s;t tend to the Diminution of your In|tere&s;t, Reputation, or Power. You'll therefore

forgive me, that I &s;trive to conceal every wrong Step made by any who have the Honour to wear Petticoats; and &s;hall at all Times do what is in my Power to make all Mankind as much their Slaves as my &s;elf.

After this Interview, the Pen&s;io|nary and the Pre&s;ident returned to the A&s;&s;embly of the States.

We are apt al&s;o to give our &s;elves very hopeful Pro&s;pects from Mon&s;ieur <HI>Torcy</HI>'s being employed in this Negotiation, who has been al|ways remarkable for a particular Way of Think|ing, in his Sen&s;e of the Greatne&s;s of <HI>France;</HI> which he has always &s;aid, <HI>Was to be promoted rather by the Arts of Peace, than tho&s;e of War.</HI> His delivering him&s;elf freely on this Subject, has formerly appeared an un&s;ucce&s;sful Way to Power in that Court; but in its pre&s;ent Circum&s;tan|ces, tho&s;e Maxims are better received; and it is thought a certain Argument of the Since|rity of the <HI>French</HI> King's Intentions, that this Mini&s;ter is at pre&s;ent made u&s;e of.

<P>THE Di&s;cour&s;e has happened to turn this Evening upon the true Nature of Panegy|rick, the Perfection of which was a&s;&s;erted to con&s;i&s;t in a certain artful Way of conveying the Applau&s;e in an indirect Manner. There was a Gentleman gave us &s;everal In&s;tances of it: A|mong others, he quoted (from Sir <HI>Francis Ba|con,</HI> in his <HI>Advancement of Learning</HI>) a very great Compliment made to <HI>Tiberius,</HI> as follows: In a full Debate upon Publick Affairs in the Se|nate, one of the A&s;&s;embly ro&s;e up, and with a very grave Air &s;aid, He thought it for the Ho|nour and Dignity of the Commonwealth, that <HI>Tiberius</HI> &s;hould be declared a God, and have Di|vine Wor&s;hip paid him. The Emperor was &s;urprized at the Propo&s;al, and demanded of him to declare whether he had made any Ap|plication to incline him to that Overture? The Senator an&s;wered, with a bold and haughty Tone, <HI>Sir, In Matters that concern the Common|wealth, I will be governed by no Man.</HI> Another Gentleman mentioned &s;omething of the &s;ame Kind &s;poken by the late Duke of <HI>B&mdash;m,</HI> to the late Earl of <HI>O&mdash;y: My Lord,</HI> (&s;ays the Duke, after his Libertine Way) <HI>you will certain|ly be Damn'd. How, my Lord!</HI> &s;ays the Earl with &s;ome Warmth. <HI>Nay,</HI> &s;ays the Duke, <HI>there's no Help for it, for it is po&s;itively &s;aid, Cur&s;ed is he of whom all Men &s;peak well.</HI> This is taking a Man by Surprize, and being welcome when you have &s;o &s;urprized him. The Per&s;on flattered receives you into his Clo&s;et at once; and the
<PB N="121" REF="128">
&s;udden Change in his Heart, from the Ex|pectation of an Ill-wi&s;her, to find you his Friend, makes you in his full Favour in a Mo|ment. The Spirits that were rai&s;ed &s;o &s;udden|ly again&s;t you, are as &s;uddenly for you. There was another In&s;tance given of this Kind at the Table: A Gentleman who had a very great Favour done him, and an Employment be&s;tow|ed upon him, without &s;o much as being known to his Benefactor, waited upon the Great Man who was &s;o Generous, and was beginning to &s;ay, he was infinitely obliged. <HI>Not at all,</HI> &s;ays the Patron, turning from him to another, <HI>Had I known a more de&s;erving Man in</HI> England, <HI>he &s;hould not have had it.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hould certainly have had more Exam|ples, had not a Gentleman produced a Book which he thought an In&s;tance of this kind: It was a Pamphlet, call'd, <HI>The Naked Truth.</HI> The Idea any one would have of that Work from the Title, was, That there would be much Plain Dealing with People in Power, and that we &s;hould &s;ee Things in their proper Light, &s;tripped of the Ornaments which are u&s;ually given to the Actions of the Great: But the Skill of this Author is &s;uch, that he has, under that rugged Appearance, approved him&s;elf the fine&s;t Gentleman and Courtier that ever writ. The Language is extremely &s;ublime, and not at all to be under&s;tood by the Vulgar: The Senti|ments are &s;uch as would make no Figure in ordinary Words; but &s;uch is the Art of the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, and the Thoughts are elevated to &s;o high a Degree, that I que&s;tion whether the Di&s;|cour&s;e will &s;ell much. There was an ill-na|tured Fellow pre&s;ent, who hates all Panegy|rick mortally. <HI>P&mdash; take him!</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>What the Devil means his</HI> Naked Truth, <HI>in &s;peaking nothing but to the Advantage of all whom he</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="129">
<HI>mentions? This is ju&s;t &s;uch a great Action as that of the Champion's on a Coronation Day, who chal|lenges all Mankind to di&s;pute with him the Right of the Sovereign, &s;urrounded with his Guards.</HI> The Gentleman who produced the Treati&s;e, de&s;ired him to be cautious, and &s;aid, it was writ by an excellent Soldier, which made the Company ob&s;erve it more narrowly: And (as Criticks are the greate&s;t Conjurers at finding out a known <HI>Truth</HI>) one &s;aid, he was &s;ure it was writ by the Hand of his Sword-Arm. I could not perceive much wit in that Expre&s;&s;i|on; but it rais'd a Laugh, and I &s;uppo&s;e, was meant as a Sneer upon valiant Men. The &s;ame Man pretended to &s;ee in the Style, that it was an Hor&s;e-Officer; but &s;ure that's being too nice: For though you may know Officers of the Cavalry by the Turn of their <HI>Feet,</HI> I can't ima|gine how you &s;hould di&s;cern their <HI>Hands</HI> from tho&s;e of other Men. But it is always thus with Pedants; they will ever be carping, if a Gen|tleman or a Man of Honour puts Pen to Paper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> I don't doubt, but this Author will find this A&s;&s;ertion too true, and that Obloquy is not re|pul&s;ed by the Force of Arms.

<P>This Day arrived a Mail from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> with Letters of the 13th In&s;tant, <HI>N.

The latter Commander having an Ambition to ravage the Country, in a Manner in Sight of the <HI>Portu|gueze,</HI> made a Motion with the whole Body f his Hor&s;e toward Fort St. <HI>Chri&s;topher,</HI> near the Town of <HI>Badajos.</HI> The Generals of the <HI>Portu|gueze,</HI> di&s;daining that &s;uch an In&s;ult &s;hould be offered to their Arms, took a Re&s;olution to pa&s;s the River, and oppo&s;e the De&s;igns of the Ene|my. The Earl of <HI>Galway</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">epre&s;ented to them, That the pre&s;ent Po&s;tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e of Affairs wa &s;uch on the Side of the Allies, that there needed no more to be done at pre&s;ent in that Country,

but to carry on a Defen&s;ive Part. But his Ar|guments could not avail in the Council of War. Upon which, a great Detachment of Foot, and the whole of the Hor&s;e of the King of <HI>Portu|gal</HI>'s Army, pa&s;&s;ed the River, and with &s;ome Pieces of Cannon did good Execution on the Enemy. Upon ob&s;erving this, the Marquis <HI>de Bay</HI> advanced with his Hor&s;e, and attacked the Right Wing of the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Cavalry, who faced about, and fled, without &s;tanding the fir&s;t Encounter. But their Foot repul&s;ed the &s;ame Body of Hor&s;e in three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Charges, with great Order and Re&s;olution. While this was tran&s;acting, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> General com|manded the Brigade of <HI>Pearce,</HI> to keep the Enemy in Diver&s;ion by a new Attack. This was &s;o well executed, that the <HI>Portugueze</HI> In|fantry had Time to retire in good Order, and repa&s;s the River. But that Brigade, which re&s;cued 'em, was it &s;elf &s;urrounded by the Ene|my, and Major-General <HI>Sarkey,</HI> Brigadier <HI>Pearce,</HI> together with both their Regiments, and that of the Lord <HI>Galway,</HI> lately rai&s;ed, were taken Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>During the Engagement, the Earl of <HI>Barry|more</HI> having advanced too far to give &s;ome ne|ce&s;&s;ary Order, was hemmed in by a Squadron of the Enemy; but found Means to gallop up to the Brigade of <HI>Pearce,</HI> with which he remains al&s;o a Pri&s;oner. My Lord <HI>Galway</HI> had his Hor&s;e &s;hot under him in this Action; and the Conde <HI>de St. Juan,</HI> a <HI>Portugueze</HI> General, was taken Pri&s;oner. The &s;ame Night the Army encamped at <HI>Aronches,</HI> and on the 9th moved to <HI>Elvas,</HI> where they lay when the&s;e Di&s;|patches came away. Colonel <HI>Stanwix</HI>'s Regi|ment is al&s;o taken. The whole of this Affair has given the <HI>Portugueze</HI> a great Idea of the Capacity and Courage of my Lord <HI>Galway,</HI> a|gain&s;t

who&s;e Advice they entered upon this un|fortunate Affair, and by who&s;e Conduct they were re&s;cued from it. The prodigious Con|&s;tancy and Re&s;olution of that great Man is hard|ly to be parallel'd, who, under the Oppre&s;&s;ion of a maimed Body, and the Reflection of repeated ill Fortune, goes on with an un&s;peak|able Alacrity in the Service of the Common Cau&s;e.

<P>IT is ob&s;erved too often, that Men of Wit do &s;o much employ their Thoughts upon fine Speculations, that Things u&s;eful to Mankind are wholly neglected; and they are bu&s;y in making Emendations upon &s;ome Encliticks in a <HI>Greek</HI> Author, while obvious Things, that e|very Man may have u&s;e for, are wholly overlooked. It would be an happy Thing, if &s;uch as have real Capacities for Pub|lick Service, were employed in Works of general U&s;e; but becau&s;e a Thing is every Body's Bu&s;ine&s;s, it is no Body's Bu&s;ine&s;s: This is for Want of publick Spirit. As for my Part, who am only a Student, and a Man of no great Intere&s;t, I can only remark Things, and recommend the Correction of 'em to high|er Powers. There is an Offence I have a Thou|&s;and Times lamented, but fear I &s;hall never &s;ee remedi d; which is, That in a Nation where Learning is &s;o frequent as in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> there &s;hould be &s;o many gro&s;s Errors as there are in the very Directions of Things, wherein Accuracy is nece&s;&s;ary &s;o the Conduct of Life. This is notoriou&s;ly ob&s;erved by all Men of Letters when they fir&s;t come to Town (at
<PB N="127" REF="134">
which Time they are u&s;ually curious that Way) in the In&s;criptions on Sign-Po&s;ts. I have Cau&s;e to know this Matter as well as any Body; for I have (when I went to Merchant-Taylor's School) &s;uffered Stripes for &s;pelling after the Signs I ob&s;erved in my Way; tho' at the &s;ame Time, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;taring at tho&s;e In&s;crip|tions fir&s;t gave me an Idea and Curio&s;ity for Medals; in which I have &s;ince arrived at &s;ome Knowledge. Many a Man has lo&s;t his Way and his Dinner by this general Want of Skill in Orthography: For, con&s;idering that the Painters are u&s;ually &s;o very bad, that you can|not know the Animal under who&s;e Sign you are to live that Day, How mu&s;t the Stranger be mi&s;&s;ed, if it be wrong &s;pelled, as well as ill painted? I have a Cou&s;in now in Town, who has an&s;wered under <HI>Batchellor</HI> at <HI>Queen</HI>'s College, who&s;e Name is <HI>Humphrey Mop&s;taff:</HI> (He is a Kin to us by his Mother.) This young Man going to &s;ee a Relation in <HI>Barbekin,</HI> wan|dered a whole Day by the Mi&s;take of one Let|ter, for it was written, <HI>This is the BEER,</HI> in&s;tead of, <HI>This is the BEAR.</HI> He was &s;et right at la&s;t, by enquiring for the Hou&s;e, of a Fellow who could not read, and knew the Place mechanically, only by having been often drunk there. But, in the Name of Goodne&s;s, let us make our Learning of U&s;e to us, or not. Was not this a Shame, that a Philo&s;opher &s;hould be thus directed by a Cobler? I'll be &s;worn, if it were known how many have &s;uffered in this Kind by fal&s;e Speeling &s;ince the Union, this Matter would not long lie thus. What makes the&s;e Evils the more in&s;upporta|ble, is, That they are &s;o ea&s;ily amended, and nothing done in it. But it is &s;o far from that, that the Evil goes on in other Arts as well as Orthography. Places are confounded, as well
<PB N="128" REF="135">
for want of proper Di&s;tinctions, as Things for Want of true Characters. Had I not come by the other Day very early in the Morning, there might have been Mi&s;chief done; for a worthy <HI>North-Britain</HI> was &s;wearing at <HI>Stocks-market</HI> that they would not let him in at his Ludg|ings; but I knowing the Gentleman, and ob|&s;erving him look often at the King on Hor&s;e|back, and then double his Oaths, that he was &s;ure he was right, found he mi&s;took that for <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s,</HI> by the Erection of the like Sta|tue in each Place. I grant, private Men may di&s;tingui&s;h their Abodes as they plea&s;e; as one of my Acquaintance who lives at <HI>Marybone,</HI> has put a good Sentence of his own Invention upon his Dwelling-place, to find out where he lives: He is &s;o near <HI>London,</HI> that his Conceit is this, <HI>The Country in Town;</HI> or, <HI>The Town in the Coun|try;</HI> for you know, if they are both in one, they are all one.

<P>This Day a Mail arrived from <HI>Holland,</HI> by which there are Advices from <HI>Paris,</HI> That the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> is in the utmo&s;t Mi&s;ery and Di&s;traction. The Merchants of <HI>Lions</HI> have been
<PB N="129" REF="136">
at Court, to remon&s;trate their great Sufferings by the Failure of their Publick Credit; but have received no other Satisfaction, than Pro|mi&s;es of a &s;udden Peace; and that their Debts will be made good by Funds out of the Re|venue, which will not an&s;wer, but in ca&s;e of the Peace which is promi&s;ed. In the mean Time, the Cries of the common People are loud for Want of Bread, the Gentry have lo&s;t all Spirit and Zeal for their Country, and the King him&s;elf &s;eems to langui&s;h under the An|xiety of the pre&s;&s;ing Calamities of the Nation, and retires from hearing tho&s;e Grievances, which he hath not Power to redre&s;s. In&s;tead of Preparations for War, and the Defence of their Country, there is nothing to be &s;een but evident Marks of a general De&s;pair. Proce&s;&s;i|ons, Fa&s;tings, Publick Mournings, and Humili|ations, are become the &s;ole Employments of a People, who were lately the mo&s;t vain and gay of any in the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>The Pope has written to the <HI>French</HI> King on the Subject of a Peace, and his Maje&s;ty has an|&s;wered in the lowlie&s;t Terms, That he entirely &s;ubmits his Affairs to Divine Providence, and &s;hall &s;oon &s;how the World, that he prefers the Tranquility of his People to the Glory of his Arms, and Extent of his Conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>Letters from the <HI>Hague</HI> of the 24th &s;ay, That his Excellency the Lord <HI>Toxn&s;hend</HI> delivered his Credentials on that Day to the States-Ge|neral, as Plenipotentiary from the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> as did al&s;o Count <HI>Zinzendorf,</HI> who bears the &s;ame Character from the Em|peror.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> intended to &s;et out the next Day for <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and his Grace the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> on the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> following. The Marquis <HI>de Torcy</HI> talks daily of going, but &s;till

continues here. The Army of the Allies is to a&s;&s;emble on the 7th of the next Month at <HI>Hel|chin;</HI> though 'tis generally believed, that the Preliminar es to a Treaty are fully adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>The Approech of a Peace &s;trikes a Pannick thro' ou Armies, tho' that of a Battle could ne|ver do it, and they almo&s;t repent of their Bra|very, that made &s;uch ha&s;t to humble them|&s;elves and the <HI>French</HI> King. The Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> tho' otherwi&s;e the greate&s;t Gene|ral of the Age, has plainly &s;hown him&s;elf un|acquainted with the Arts of Husbanding a War. He might have grown as old as the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> or Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and yet have got Reputation enough every Year for any rea&s;onable Man: For the Command of General in <HI>Flanders</HI> hath been ever looked upon as a Provi&s;ion for Life. For my Pa t, I can't &s;ee how his Grace can an&s;wer it to the World, for the great Eagerne&s;s he hath &s;hown to &s;end a Hundred Thou&s;and of the brave&s;t Fellows in <HI>Europe</HI> a begging. But the pr vate Gentlemen of the Infantry will be able to &s;hift for them&s;elves; a brave Man can never &s;tarve in a Country &s;tock'd with Hen-roo&s;ts. <HI>There is not a Yard of Linnen,</HI> &s;ays my honour|ed P ogenitor, Sir <HI>John Fal&s;taff, in my whole Company; but as for that,</HI> &s;ays this worthy Knight, <HI>I am in no great Pain, we &s;hall find Shirts on every Heage.</HI> There is another Sort of Gentlemen whom I am much more concerned for, and that is, the ingenious Fraternity of which I have the Honour to be an unworthy Member; I mean th <HI>News-Writers of Great Britain,</HI> whe|ther <HI>Po&s;t-Men</HI> or <HI>Po&s;t-Boys,</HI> or by what other Name or Title &s;oever dignified or di&s;tingui&s;hed. The Ca&s;e of the&s;e Gentlemen is, I think, more hard than that of the Soldiers, con&s;idering that they have taken more Towns, and fought more
<PB N="131" REF="138">
Battels. They have been upon Parties and Skirmi&s;hes, when our Armies have lain &s;till; and given the General A&s;&s;ault to many a Place, when the Be&s;iegers were quiet in their Trench|es. They have made us Ma&s;ters of &s;everal &s;trong Towns many Weeks before our Generals could do it; and compleated Victories, when our greate&s;t Captains have been glad to come off with a drawn Battle. Where Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> has &s;lain his Thou&s;ands, <HI>Boyer</HI> has &s;lain his Ten Thou&s;ands. This Gentleman can indeed be never enough commended for his Courage and Intrepidity during this whole War: He has laid about him with an inexpre&s;&s;ible Fury, and like the offended <HI>Marius</HI> of Ancient <HI>Rome,</HI> made &s;uch Havock among his Countrymen, as mu&s;t be the Work of Two or Three Ages to re|pair. It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, the Redoubted Mr. <HI>Buckley</HI> has &s;hed as much Blood as the former; but I cannot forbear &s;aying, (and I hope it will not look like Envy) that we re|gard our Brother <HI>Buckley</HI> as a kind of <HI>Drawcan|&s;ir,</HI> who &s;pares neither Friend or Foe: But gene|rally kills as many of his own Side as the Ene|my's. It is impo&s;&s;ible for this ingenious Sort of Men to &s;ub&s;i&s;t after a Peace: Every one re|members the Shifts they were driven to in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, when they could not furni&s;h out a &s;ingle Paper of News, without lighting up a Comet in <HI>Germany,</HI> or a Fire in <HI>Mo&s;cow.</HI> There &s;carce appeared a Letter without a Paragraph on an Earthquake. Pro|digies were grown &s;o familiar, that they had lo&s;t their Name, as a great Poet of that Age has it I remember Mr. <HI>Dyer,</HI> who is ju&s;tly look'd upon by all the Fox-hunters in the Na|tion as the greate&s;t State&s;man our Country has produced, was particularly famous for dealing in Whales, in&s;omuch that in Five Months Time

<P>THERE is nothing can give a Man of any Con&s;ideration greater Pain, than to &s;ee Or|der and Di&s;tinction laid a&s;ide among&s;t Men, e&s;pecially when the Rank (of which he him&s;elf is a Member) is intruded upon by &s;uch as have no Pretence to that Honour. The Appellation of <HI>E&s;quire</HI> is the mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly abu&s;ed in this Kind of any Cla&s;s among&s;t Men, in&s;omuch that it is become almo&s;t the Subject of Deri&s;ion; but I will be bold to &s;ay, This Behaviour towards it proceeds from the Ignorance of the People in its true Origine. I &s;hall therefore, as briefly as po&s;|&s;ible, do my &s;elf and all true <HI>E&s;quires</HI> the Ju&s;tice to look into Antiquity upon this Subject.</P>
<P>In the Fir&s;t Ages of the World, before the Invention of Jointures and Settlements, when the noble Pa&s;&s;ion of Love had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Hearts of Men, and the Fair Sex were not yet cultivated into the merciful Di&s;po&s;ition which they have &s;howed in latter Centuries, it was natural for Great and Heroick Spirits to retire to Rivulets, Woods, and Caves, to lament their De&s;tiny, and the Cruelty of the fair Per&s;ons who were deaf to their Lamentations. The Hero in this Di&s;tre&s;s was generally in Armour, and in a Readine&s;s to fight any Man he met with, e&s;pecially if di&s;tingui&s;hed by any extra|ordinary Qualifications, it being the Nature of Heroick Love to hate all Merit, le&s;t it &s;hould
<PB N="134" REF="143">
come within the Ob&s;ervation of the Cruel One, by whom its own Perfections are neglected. A Lover of this Kind had always about him a Per|&s;on of a Second Value, and &s;ubordinate to him, who could hear his Afflictions, carry an Inchant|ment for his Wounds, hold his Helmet when he was eating (if ever he did eat); or in his Ab|&s;ence, when he was retired to his Apartment in any King's Palace, tell the Prince him&s;elf, or perhaps his Daughter, the Birth, Parentage, and Adventures, of his valiant Ma&s;ter. This tru&s;ty Companion was &s;tyled his <HI>E&s;quire,</HI> and was al|ways fit for any Offices about him; was as gen|tle and cha&s;t as a Gentleman-U&s;her, quick and active as an Equerry, &s;mooth and eloquent as a Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies. A Man thus qualified was the fir&s;t, as the Ancients affirm, who was called an <HI>E&s;quire;</HI> and none without the&s;e Accompli&s;hments ought to a&s;&s;ume our Or|der: But, to the utter Di&s;grace and Confu&s;ion of the Heralds, every Pretender is admitted into this Fraternity, even Per&s;ons the mo&s;t Foreign to this courteous In&s;titution I have taken an Inventory of all within this City, and looked over every Letter in the <HI>Po&s;t-Office</HI> for my better Information. There are of the <HI>Mid|dle-Temple,</HI> including all in the Buttery-Books, and in the Li&s;ts of the Hou&s;e, 5000. In the <HI>In|ner,</HI> 4000. In the <HI>King's Bench Walks</HI> the whole Buildings are inhabited by E&s;quires only. The adjacent Street of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> from <HI>Morris</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e, and the Turning towards the <HI>Graecian,</HI> you cannot meet one who is not an E&s;quire. 'till you take Water. Every Hou&s;e in <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Arundel</HI> Streets is gove ned al&s;o by a 'Squire, or his Lady. <HI>Soho-Square, Bloomsbury-Square,</HI> and all other Places, where the Floors ri&s;e above Nine Foot, are &s;o many Univer&s;ities, where you enter your &s;elves, and become of our Order.
<PB N="135" REF="144">
However, if this were the wor&s;t of the Evil, it were to be &s;upported, becau&s;e they are generally Men of &s;ome Figure and U&s;e; though I know no Pretence they have to an Honour which had its Ri&s;e from Chivalry. But if you travel into the Counties of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> we are &s;till more impo&s;ed upon by Innovation. We are indeed derived from the Field: But &s;hall that give Ti|tle to all that ride mad after Foxes, that holloo when they &s;ee an Hare, or venture their Necks full Speed after an Hawk, immediately to com|mence E&s;quires? No; our Order is Temperate, Cleanly, Sober, and Cha&s;t; but the&s;e Rural E&s;quires commit Immode&s;ties upon Hay-cocks, wear Shirts half a Week, and are drunk Twice a Day. The&s;e Men are al&s;o to the la&s;t Degree exce&s;&s;ive in their Food: An E&s;quire of <HI>Norfolk</HI> eats Two Pounds of Dumplin every Meal, as if obliged to it by our Order: An E&s;quire in <HI>Hamp|&s;hire</HI> is as ravenous in devouring Hogs-fle&s;h: One of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> has as little Mercy on Calves. But I mu&s;t take the Liberty to prote&s;t again&s;t them, and acquaint tho&s;e Per&s;ons, that it is not the Quantity they eat, but the Manner of eating, that &s;hows a Squire. But above all, I am mo&s;t offended at &s;mall Quill men, and Tran&s;cribing Clerks, who are all come into our Order, for no Rea&s;on that I know of, but that they can ea&s;ily flouri&s;h it at the End of their Name. I'll un|dertake, that if you read the Super&s;criptions to all the Offices in the Kingdom, you will not find Three Letters directed to any but E&s;quires. I have my &s;elf a Couple of Clerks, and the Rogues make nothing of leaving Me&s;&s;ages upon each other's Desk: One directs, <HI>To Degory Goo&s;e|quill</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to which the other replies by a Note, <HI>To Nehemiah Da&s;hwell</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>with Re&s;pect.</HI> In a Word, it is now <HI>Populus Armigerorum,</HI> A Peo|ple of E&s;quires. And I don't know, but, by the
<PB N="136" REF="145">
late Act of Naturalization, Foreigners will a&s;|&s;ume that Title, as Part of the Immunity of be|ing <HI>Engli&s;hmen.</HI> All the&s;e Improprieties flow from the Negligence of the <HI>Heralds-Office.</HI> Tho&s;e Gentlemen in Party-colour'd Habits do not &s;o rightly, as they ought, under&s;tand them|&s;elves; though they are dre&s;s'd Cap-a-pe in Hieroglyphicks, they are inwardly but ignorant Men. I asked an Acquaintance of mine, who is a Man of Wit, but of no Fortune, and is for|ced to appear as Jack-pudding on the Stage to a Mountebank: Prethee, <HI>Jack.</HI> Why is your Coat of &s;o many Colours? He reply'd, I act a Fool, and this &s;potted Dre&s;s is to &s;ignifie, that every Man living has a weak Place about him; for I am Knight of the Shire, and repre&s;ent you all. I wi&s;h the Heralds would know as well as this Man does, in his Way, that they are to act for us in the Ca&s;e of our Arms and Appellations: We &s;hould not then be jumbled together in &s;o promi&s;cuous and ab&s;urd a Manne. I de&s;ign to take this Matter into fu ther Con&s;ideration, and no Man &s;hall be received as an E&s;quire, who cannot bring a Certificate, That he has con|quered &s;ome Lady's obdurate Heart; That he can lead up a Country Dance, or carry a Me&s;|&s;age between her and her Lover, with Addre&s;s, Secrecy, and Diligence.

It would be impious not to acknowledge the Indulgence of Heaven to us; but at the &s;ame Time, as we are to love our Enemies, we are glad to &s;ee 'em mortified enough to mix Chri&s;tianity with their Politicks.

'Tis true, &s;aid I, but Su&s;picions, or Gue&s;&s;es at what you mean, nay, Certainty of it, except you plainly &s;peak it, are no Foundation for a formal Suit. She clap'd her Fan before her Face; My Hu&s;|band, &s;aid &s;he, is no more an Husband <HI>(here &s;he bur&s;t into Tears)</HI> than one of the <HI>Italian</HI> Singers.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid I, the Affliction you complain of, is to be redre&s;&s;ed by Law; but at the &s;ame Time, con&s;ider what Mortifications you are to go through in bringing it into open Court; how you will be able to bear the impertinent Whi&s;|pers of the People pre&s;ent at the Tryal, the li|centious Reflections of the Pleaders, and the In|terpretations that will in general be put upon your Conduct by all the World: How little (will they &s;ay) could that Lady command her Pa&s;&s;ions. Be&s;ides, con&s;ider, that curbing our De&s;ires is the greate&s;t Glory we can arrive at in this World, and will be mo&s;t rewarded in the next. She an&s;wered, like a prudent Matron, Sir, if you plea&s;e to remember the Office of Matrimony, the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of its In&s;titution is that of having Po&s;terity: Therefore, as to the
<PB N="141" REF="150">
curbing De&s;ires, I am willing to undergo any Ab&s;tinence from Food as you plea&s;e to enjoin me; but I cannot, with any Quiet of Mind, live in the Neglect of a nece&s;&s;ary Duty, and an expre&s;s Commandment, <HI>Increa&s;e and Multi|ply.</HI> Ob&s;erving &s;he was learned, and knew &s;o well the Duties of Life, I turned my Ar|guments rather to dehort her from this Pub|lick Procedure by Examples, than Precepts. Do but con&s;ider, Madam, what Crowds of beauteous Women live in Nunneries, &s;eclu|ded for ever from the Sight and Conver&s;a|tion of Men, with all the Alacrity of Spirit imaginable; they &s;pend their Time in Hea|venly Raptures, in con&s;tant and frequent Devotion, and at proper Hours in agreeable Conver&s;ations. Sir, &s;aid &s;he ha&s;tily, Tell not me of Papi&s;ts, or any of their Idolatries. Well then, Madam, con&s;ider how many fine Ladies live innocently in the Eye of the World, and this gay Town, in the mid&s;t of Temptation: There's the Witty Mrs. <HI>W&mdash;</HI> is a Virgin of 44, Mrs. <HI>T&mdash;s</HI> is 39, Mrs. <HI>L&mdash;ce</HI> 33; yet you &s;ee, they laugh and are gay, at the Park, at the Play-hou&s;e, at Balls, and at Vi&s;its; and &s;o much at Ea&s;e, that all this &s;eems hardly a Self-denial. Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, with &s;ome Emotion, you are an excellent Ca&s;ui&s;t; but the la&s;t Word de&s;troyed your whole Argument; if it is not Self-denial, it is no Virtue. I pre&s;ented you with an Half-Guinea, in Hopes not only to have my Con&s;cience eas'd, but my Fortune told. Yet&mdash;Well Madam, &s;aid I, Pray of what Age is your Husband? He is, reply'd my in|jured Client, Fifty, and I have been his Wife Fifteen Years. How happen'd it, you never communicated your Di&s;tre&s;s in all this Time to your Friends and Relations? She an&s;wered, He has been thus but a Fortnight. I am the
<PB N="142" REF="151">
mo&s;t &s;erious Man in the World to look at, and yet could not forbear laughing out. Why, Ma|dam, in ca&s;e of Infirmity, which proceeds on|ly from Age, the Law gives no Remedy. Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I find you have no more Learning that Dr. <HI>Ca&s;e;</HI> and I am told of a young Man, not Five and Twenty, ju&s;t come from <HI>Oxford,</HI> to whom I will communicate this whole Matter, and doubt not but he will appear to have Seven Times more u&s;eful and &s;atisfactory Knowledge than you and all your boa&s;ted Family. Thus I have entirely lo&s;t my Client: But if this te|dious Narrative pre&s;erves <HI>Pa&s;torella</HI> from the intended Marriage with one Twenty Years her Senior&mdash;To &s;ave a Fine Lady, I am content|ed to have my Learning decry'd, and my <HI>Predictions</HI> bound up with <HI>Poor Robin</HI>'s <HI>Alma|nacks.</HI></P>

<P>This Evening was acted, <HI>The Recruiting Of|ficer,</HI> in which Mr. <HI>E&s;tcourt</HI>'s proper Sen&s;e and Ob&s;ervation is what &s;upports the Play. There is not, in my humble Opinion, the Humour hit in <HI>Serjeant Kite;</HI> but it is admirably &s;up|ply'd by his Action. If I have Skill to judge, that Man is an excellent Actor; but the Crowd of the Audience are fitter for Repre&s;entations at <HI>May-Fair,</HI> than a <HI>Theatre-Royal.</HI> Yet that Fair is now broke, as well as the <HI>Theatre</HI> is breaking: But it is allowed &s;till to &s;ell Animals there. Therefore, if any Lady or Gentleman have Occa&s;ion for a tame Elephant, let them enquire of Mr. <HI>Penkethman,</HI> who has one to di&s;|po&s;e of at a rea&s;onable Rate. The Downfal of <HI>May-Fair</HI> has quite &s;unk the Price of this noble Creature, as well as of many other Curio&s;ities of Nature. A Tyger will &s;ell almo&s;t as cheap as an Ox; and I am credibly informed, a Man may purcha&s;e a Cat with Three Legs, for very

I hear like|wi&s;e, That there is a great De&s;olation among the Gentlemen and Ladies who were the Or|naments of the Town, and u&s;ed to &s;hine in Plumes and Diadems; the Heroes being mo&s;t of them pre&s;s'd, and the Queens beating Hemp, Mrs. <HI>Sarabrand,</HI> &s;o famous for her ingenious Puppet-Show, has &s;et up a Shop in the <HI>Exchange,</HI> where &s;he &s;ells her little Troop under the Term of Jointed-Babies. I could not but be &s;olici|tous to know of her, how &s;he had di&s;po&s;ed of that Rake-hell <HI>Punch,</HI> who&s;e lewd Life and Conver&s;ation had given &s;o much Scandal, and did not a little contribute to the Ruin of the Fair. She told me, with a Sigh, That de&s;pair|ing of ever reclaiming him, &s;he would not of|fer to place him in a Civil Family, but got him in a Po&s;t upon a Stall in <HI>Wapping,</HI> where he may be &s;een from Sun-ri&s;ing to Sun-&s;etting, with a Gla&s;s in one Hand, and a Pipe in the other, as Centry to a Brandy-Shop. The great Revolu|tions of this Nature bring to my Mind the Di|&s;tre&s;&s;es of the unfortunate <HI>Camilla,</HI> who has had the ill Luck to break before her Voice, and to di&s;appear at a Time when her Beauty was in the Heighth of its Bloom.

This Greatne&s;s of Soul has reduced that unhap|py Prince&s;s to an involuntary Retirement, where &s;he now pa&s;&s;es her Time among the Woods and Forre&s;ts, thinking on the Crowns and Scepters &s;he has lo&s;t, and often humming over in her Solitude,

<P>A Gentleman has writ to me out of the Country a very civil Letter, and &s;aid Things which I &s;uppre&s;s with great Violence to my Vanity. There are many Terms in my Nar|ratives which he complains want explaining, and has therefore de&s;ired, that, for the Benefit of my Country Readers, I would let him know what I mean by a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> a <HI>Pretty-Fellow,</HI> a <HI>Toa&s;t,</HI> a <HI>Coquet,</HI> a <HI>Critick,</HI> a <HI>Wit,</HI> and all other Appellations of tho&s;e in the gayer World, who are in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e &s;everal Characters; together with an Account of tho&s;e who unfortu|nately pretend to 'em. I &s;hall begin with him we u&s;ually call a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> or Man of Conver|&s;ation.</P>
<P>It is generally thought, That Warmth of Ima|gination, quick Reli&s;h of Plea&s;ure, and a Man|ner of becoming it, are the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Quali|ties for forming this Sort of Man. But any one that is much in Company will ob&s;erve, that the Height of good Breeding is &s;hown rather in ne|ver giving Offence, than in doing obliging Things. Thus he that never Shocks you, tho' he is &s;eldom entertaining, is more likely to keep your Favour, than he who often entertains, and &s;ometimes di&s;plea&s;es you. The mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary Talent therefore in a Man of Conver&s;ation, which is what we ordinarily intend by a Fine Gentleman, is a good Judgment. He that has this in Perfection, is Ma&s;ter of his Companion, without letting him &s;ee it; and has the &s;ame Advantage over Men of any other Qualifications what&s;oever, as one that can &s;ee would have over a blind Man of Ten times his Strength.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="157">
This is what makes <HI>Sophronius</HI> the Darling of all who conver&s;e with him, and the mo&s;t Power|ful with his Acquaintance of any Man in Town. By the Light of this Faculty, he acts with great Ea&s;e and Freedom among the Men of Plea&s;ure, and acquits him&s;elf with Skill and Di&s;patch among the Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s. All which he per|forms with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that, with as much Di&s;cretion in Life as any Man ever had, he neither is, nor appears Cunning. But as he does a good Office, if he ever does it, with Readine&s;s and Alacrity; &s;o he denies what he does not care to engage in, in a Manner that convinces you, that you ought not to have asked it. His Judgment is &s;o good and unerring, and accompanied with &s;o chearful a Spirit, that his Conver&s;ation is a con|tinual Fea&s;t, at which he helps &s;ome, and is helped by others, in &s;uch a Manner, that the Equality of Society is perfectly kept up, and every Man obliges as much as he is obliged: For it is the greate&s;t and ju&s;te&s;t Skill in a Man of Superior Under&s;tanding, to know how to be on a Level with his Companions. This &s;weet Di&s;|po&s;ition runs through all the Actions of <HI>Sophro|nius,</HI> and make his Company de&s;ired by Wo|men, without being envied by Men. <HI>Sophro|nius</HI> would be as ju&s;t as he is, if there were no Law; and would be as di&s;creet as he is, if there were no &s;uch Thing as Calumny.</P>
<P>In Imitation of this agreeable Being, is made that Animal we call a <HI>Pretty Fellow;</HI> who being ju&s;t able to find out, that what makes <HI>Sophro|nius</HI> acceptable, is a Natural Behaviour; in or|der to the &s;ame Reputation, makes his own an Artificial one. <HI>Jack Dimple</HI> is his perfect Mi|mick, whereby he is of Cour&s;e the mo&s;t un|like him of all Men living. <HI>Sophronius</HI> ju&s;t now pa&s;&s;ed into the inner Room directly forward: <HI>Jack</HI> comes as fa&s;t after as he can for the Right

and Left Looking-gla&s;s, in which he had but ju&s;t approved him&s;elf by a Nod at each, and marched on. He will meditate within for Half an Hour, till he thinks he is not carele&s;s enough in his Air, and come back to the Mirror to re|collect his Forgetfulne&s;s.</P>

<P>This Night was acted the Comedy, called, <HI>The Fox;</HI> but I wonder the Modern Writers do not u&s;e their Intere&s;t in the Hou&s;e to &s;uppre&s;s &s;uch Repre&s;entations. A Man that has been at this, will ha dly like any other Play during the Sea|&s;on: Therefore I humbly move, That the Wri|tings, as well as Dre&s;&s;es, of the la&s;t Age, &s;hould give Way to the pre&s;ent Fa&s;hion. We are come into a good Method enough (if we were not in|terrupted in our Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">th by &s;uch an Apparition as a Play of <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s) to be entertained at more Ea&s;e, both to the Spectator and the Writer, than in the Days of Old. It is no Difficulty to get Hats, and Swords, and Wigs, and Shooes, and every Thing el&s;e, from the Shops in Town, and make a Man &s;how him&s;elf by his Habit, without more ado, to be a Coun&s;ellor, a Fop, a Courtier, or a Citizen, and not be obliged to make tho&s;e Characters talk in different Dia|lects to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other. This is certainly the &s;ure&s;t and be&s;t Way of Writing: But &s;uch a Play as this makes a Man for a Month after over-run with Critici&s;m, and enquire, <HI>What every Man on the Stage &s;aid? What had &s;uch a one to do to meddle with &s;uch a Thing? How came t'other, who was bred after this or that Manner, to &s;peak &s;o like a Man conver&s;ant among a different People?</HI> The&s;e Que&s;tions rob us of all our Plea&s;ure; for at this Rate, no Sentence in a Play &s;hould be &s;poken by any one Character which could po&s;&s;ibly enter into the Head of any other Man repre&s;ented in it; but
<PB N="150" REF="159">
every Sentiment &s;hould be peculiar to him only who utters it. Laborious <HI>Ben</HI>'s Works will bear this Sort of Inqui&s;ition; but if the pre&s;ent Wri|ters were thus examined, and the Offences a|gain&s;t this Rule cut out, few Plays would be long enough for the whole Evening's Entertainment.</P>
<P>But I don't know how they did in tho&s;e old Times: This &s;ame <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> has made every one's Pa&s;&s;ion in this Play be towards Money, and yet not one of them expre&s;&s;es that De&s;ire, or endeavour to obtain it any Way but what is peculiar to him only: One &s;acrifices his Wife, another his Profe&s;&s;ion, another his Po&s;terity, from the &s;ame Motive; but their Characters are kept &s;o skilfully apart, that it &s;eems prodigious their Di&s;cour&s;es &s;hould ri&s;e from the Intention of the &s;ame Author.</P>
<P>But the Poets are a Ne&s;t of Hornets, and I'll drive the&s;e Thoughts no farther, but mu&s;t men|tion &s;ome hard Treatment I am like to meet with from my Brother Writers. I am credibly inform|ed, that the Author of a Play, call'd, <HI>Love in a Hollow Tree,</HI> has made &s;ome Remarks upon my late Di&s;cour&s;e on <HI>The Naked Truth.</HI> I cannot blame a Gentleman for writing again&s;t any Er|ror; it is for the Good of the learned World. But I would have the Thing fairly left between us Two, and not under the Protection of Patrons. But my Intelligence is, that he has dedicated his Treati&s;e to the Honourable Mr. <HI>Edw&mdash;d H&mdash;rd.</HI></P>

<P>I Came hither this Evening to &s;ee Fa&s;hions, and who &s;hould I fir&s;t encounter but my old Friend <HI>Cynthio</HI> (encompa&s;&s;ed by a Crowd of young Fellows) dictating on the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love with the gaye&s;t Air imaginable. <Q REND="inline">'Well, &s;ays he, as to what I know of the Matter, there is nothing but Ogling with Skill carries a Wo|man; but indeed it is not every Fool that is capable of this Art: You will find Twenty can &s;peak eloquently, Fifty can fight man|fully, and a Thou&s;and that can dre&s;s gen|teely at a Mi&s;tre&s;s, where there is one that can gaze skilfully. This requires an exqui&s;ite Judgment, to take the Language of her Eyes to yours exactly, and not let yours talk too fa&s;t for hers; as at a Play between the Acts, when Beau <HI>Frisk</HI> &s;tands upon a Bench full in <HI>Linda|mira</HI>'s Face, and her dear Eyes are &s;earching round to avoid that flaring open Fool; &s;he meets the watchful Glance of her true Lover, and &s;ees his Heart attentive on her Charms, and waiting for a &s;econd Twincle of her Eye for its next Motion. Here the good Company &s;neer'd; but he goes on. Nor is this Atten|dance a Slavery, when a Man meets Encou|ragement, and her Eye comes often in his Way: For, after an Evening &s;o &s;pent, and the Repe|tition of Four or Five &s;ignificant Looks at him, the happy Man goes Home to his Lodging, full of Ten thou&s;and plea&s;ing Images: His Brain is dilated, and gives him all the Idea's and Pro|&s;pects which it ever lets in to its Seat of Plea|&s;ure.
<PB N="157" REF="166">
Thus a kind Look from <HI>Lindamira</HI> re|vives in his Imagination all the Beauteous Launs, Green Fields, Woods, Fore&s;ts, Rivers, and Solitudes, which he had ever before &s;een in Picture, De&s;cription, or Real Life: And all with this Addition, That he now &s;ees 'em with the Eyes of an happy Lover, as before only with tho&s;e of a common Man. You laugh, Gentlemen: But con&s;ider your &s;elves, (you common People that were never in Love) and compare your &s;elves in good Humour with your &s;elves out of Humour, and you will then acknowledge, that all External Objects affect you according to the Di&s;po&s;ition you are in to receive their Impre&s;&s;ions, and not as tho&s;e Ob|jects are in their own Nature. How much more &s;hall all that pa&s;&s;es within his View and Ob|&s;ervation, touch with Delight a Man who is prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with &s;ucce&s;sful Love, which is an A&s;&s;emblage of &s;oft Affections, gay De&s;ires, and hopeful Re&s;olutions?'</Q></P>
<P>Poor <HI>Cynthio</HI> went on at this Rate to the Crowd about him, without any Purpo&s;e in his Talk, but to vent an Heart overflowing with Sen&s;e of Suc|ce&s;s. I wondered what could exalt him from the Di&s;tre&s;s in which he had long appear'd, to &s;o much Alacrity. But my Familiar has given me the State of his Affairs. It &s;eems then, that lately coming out of the Play-hou&s;e, his Mi&s;tre&s;s, who knows he is in her Livery, as the Manner of in&s;olent Beauties, is re&s;olved to keep him &s;till &s;o, and gave him &s;o much Wages, as to complain to him of the Crowd &s;he was to pa&s;s through. He had his Wits and Re&s;olution enough about him to take her Hand, and &s;ay, He would attend her to her Coach. All the Way thither, my good young Man &s;tammer'd at every Word, and &s;tumbled at every Step. His Mi&s;tre&s;s, wonderfully plea&s;ed with her Triumph, put him to a Thou&s;and Que&s;ti|ons,

to make a Man of his natural Wit &s;peak with He&s;itation, and let drop her Fan, to &s;ee him recover it aukwardly. This is the whole Foundation of <HI>Cynthio</HI>'s Recovery to the &s;pright|ly Air he appears with at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I grew mighty curious to know &s;omething more of that Lady's Affairs, as being amaz'd how &s;he could dally with an Offer of one of his Merit and Fortune. I &s;ent <HI>Pacolet</HI> to her Lodg|ings, who immediately brought me back the fol|lowing Letter to her Friend and Confident <HI>A|manda</HI> in the Country, wherein &s;he has open'd her Heart and all its Folds.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Amanda,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Town grows &s;o empty, that you mu&s;t ex|pect my Letter &s;o too, except you will allow me to talk of my &s;elf in&s;tead of others: You can|not imagine what Pain it is, after a whole Day &s;pent in Publick, to want your Company, and the Ea&s;e which Friend&s;hip allows in being vain to each other, and &s;peaking all our Minds. An Ac|count of the Slaughter which the&s;e unhappy Eyes have made within Ten Days la&s;t pa&s;t, would make me appear too great a Tyrant to be allowed in a Chri&s;tian Country. I &s;hall therefore confine my &s;elf to my Principal Conque&s;ts, which are the Hearts of Beau <HI>Frisk,</HI> and <HI>Jack Freeland,</HI> be|&s;ides <HI>Cynthio,</HI> who, you know, wore my Fetters before you went out of Town. Shall I tell you my Weakne&s;s? I begin to love <HI>Frisk:</HI> It is the be&s;t humoured Impertinent Thing in the World: He is always too in waiting, and will certainly carry me off one Time or other. <HI>Freeland</HI>'s Father and mine have been upon Treaty without con&s;ulting me; and <HI>Cynthio</HI> has been eternally watching my Eyes, without approaching me, my Friends, my Maid, or any one about me: He hopes to get me, I believe, as they &s;ay the Rattle Snake does
<PB N="159" REF="170">
the Squirrel, by &s;taring at me till I drop into his Mouth. <HI>Freeland</HI> demands me for a Jointure which he thinks de&s;erves me; <HI>Cynthio</HI> thinks nothing high enough to be my Value: <HI>Freeland</HI> therefore will take it for no Obligation to have me; and <HI>Cynthio</HI>'s Idea of me, is what will vani&s;h by know|ing me better. Familiarity will equally turn the Veneration of the one, and the Indifference of the other, into Contempt. I will &s;tick therefore to my old Maxim, To have that Sort of Man, who can have no greater Views than what are in my Power to give him Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. The utmo&s;t of my Dear <HI>Frisk</HI>'s Ambition is, to be thought a Man of Fa|&s;hion; and therefore has been &s;o much in Mode, as to re&s;olve upon me, becau&s;e the whole Town likes me. Thus I choo&s;e rather a Man who loves me becau&s;e others do, than one who approves me on his own Judgment. He that judges for him|&s;elf in Love, will often change his Opinion; but he that follows the Sen&s;e of others, mu&s;t be con|&s;tant, as long as a Woman can make Advances. The Vi&s;its I make, the Entertainments I give, and the Addre&s;&s;es I receive, will be all Argu|ments for me with a Man of <HI>Frisk</HI>'s &s;econd-hand Genius; but would be &s;o many Bars to my Hap|pine&s;s with any other Man. However, &s;ince <HI>Frisk</HI> can wait, I &s;hall enjoy a Summer or Two longer, and remain a &s;ingle Woman, in the &s;ublime Plea|&s;ure of being followed and admired; which no|thing can equal, except that of being beloved by you.</P>

<P>THE Generality of Mankind are &s;o very fond of this World, and of &s;taying in it, that a Man cannot have eminent Skill in any one Art, but they will, in Spite of his Teeth, make him a Phy&s;ician al&s;o, that being the Science the Worldings have mo&s;t need of. I pretended, when I fir&s;t &s;et up, to A&s;trology only; but I am told, I have deep Skill al&s;o in Medecine. I am applied to now by a Gentleman for my Advice in Behalf of his Wife, who, upon the lea&s;t Matri|monial Difficulty, is exce&s;&s;ively troubled with Fits, and can bear no Manner of Pa&s;&s;ion without falling into immediate Convul&s;ions. I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, it is a Ca&s;e I have known before, and re|member the Party was recovered by certain Words pronounced in the mid&s;t of the Fit, by the Learned Doctor who performed the Cure. The&s;e Ails have u&s;ually their Beginning from the Affections of the Mind: Therefore you mu&s;t have Patience to let me give you an In&s;tance, whereby you may di&s;cern the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;temper, and then proceed in the Cure as follows:</P>
<P>A fine Town Lady was married to a Gentle|man of ancient De&s;cent in one of the Counties
<PB N="163" REF="174">
of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who had good Humour to a Weakne&s;s, and was that Sort of Per&s;on, of whom it is u&s;ually &s;aid, He is no Man's Ene|my but his own: One who had too much Ten|derne&s;s of Soul to have any Authority with his Wife; and &s;he too little Sen&s;e to give him Au|thority for that Rea&s;on. His kind Wife ob&s;erved this Temper in him, and made proper U&s;e of it. But knowing it was below a Gentlewoman to wrangle, &s;he re&s;olved upon an Expedient to &s;ave Decorum, and wear her Dear to her Point at the &s;ame Time. She therefore took upon her to go|vern him, by falling into Fits whenever &s;he was repul&s;ed in a Reque&s;t, or contradicted in a Di&s;|cour&s;e. It was a Fi&s;h-Day, when in the mid&s;t of her Husband's good Humour at Table, &s;he bethought her &s;elf to try her Project. She made Signs that &s;he had &s;wallowed a Bone. The Man grew pale as A&s;hes, and ran to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, calling for Drink. No, my Dear, &s;aid &s;he, reco|vering, It is down; don't be frightened. This Accident betrayed his Softne&s;s enough. The next Day &s;he complained, a Lady's Chariot, who&s;e Husband had not half his E&s;tate, had a Crane-Neck, and hung with twice the Air that hers did. He an&s;wered, Madam, You know my Income, you know I have lo&s;t Two Coach-Hor&s;es this Spring.&mdash;Down &s;he fell.&mdash;<HI>Harts|horn!</HI> Betty, Su&s;an, Alice, <HI>throw Water in her Face.</HI> With much Care and Pains &s;he was at la&s;t brought to her &s;elf, and the Vehicle in which &s;he vi&s;ited was amended in the nice&s;t Manner, to prevent Relap&s;es; but they frequently happen'd during that Husband's whole Life, which he had the good Fortune to end in few Years after. The Di&s;con&s;olate &s;oon pitched upon a very agreeable Succe&s;&s;or, whom &s;he very prudently de&s;igned to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> by the &s;ame Method.

She immediately fainted&mdash;He &s;tarts up as amaz'd, and calls for Help&mdash;The Maids ran to the Clo&s;et&mdash;He chafes her Face, bends her forwards, and beats the Palms of her Hands: Her Convul&s;ions increa&s;e, and down &s;he tumbles on the Floor, where &s;he lies quite dead, in Spight of what the whole Fa|mily, from the Nur&s;ery to the Kitchin, could do for her Relief.</P>
<P>While every Servant was thus helping or la|menting their Mi&s;tre&s;s, he, fixing his Cheek to hers, &s;eemed to be following her in a Trance of Sorrow; but &s;ecretly whi&s;pers her, <HI>My Dear, This will never do: What is within my Power and Fortune, you may always command, but none of your Artifices: You are quite in other Hands than tho&s;e you pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e pretty Pa&s;&s;ions upon.</HI> This made her almo&s;t in the Condition &s;he pretended; her Convul&s;ions now come thicker, nor was &s;he to be held down. The kind Man doubles his Care, helps the Servants to throw Water in her Face by full Quarts; and when the &s;inking Part of the Fit came again, <HI>Well, my Dear,</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>I applaud your Action; but I mu&s;t take my Leave of you till you are more &s;incere with me. Farewell for ever: You &s;hall always know where to hear of me, and want for nothing.</HI> With that, he or|dered the Maids to keep plying her with Harts|horn, while he went for a Phy&s;ician: He was &s;carce at the Stair-head when &s;he followed, and pulling him into a Clo&s;et, thank'd him for her Cure; which was &s;o ab&s;olute, that &s;he gave me this Relation her &s;elf, to be communi|cated

<P>THE &s;urpri&s;ing News which arrived this Day, of your Maje&s;ty's having refu&s;ed to &s;ign the Treaty your Mini&s;ters have in a Manner &s;ued for, is what gives Ground to this Application to your Maje&s;ty, from one who&s;e Name, perhaps, is too ob&s;cure to have ever reached your Territories; but one, who with all the <HI>European</HI> World, is affected with your Determinations. Therefore,
<PB N="167" REF="178">
as it is mine and the common Cau&s;e of Man|kind, I pre&s;ume to expo&s;tulate with you on this Occa&s;ion. It will, I doubt not, appear to the Vulgar extravagant, that the Actions of a mighty Prince &s;hould be ballanced by the Cen&s;ure of a private Man, who&s;e Approbation or Di&s;like are equally contemptible in their Eyes, when they regard the Thrones of Sovereigns. But your Maje&s;ty has &s;hown, through the whole Cour&s;e of your Reign, too great a Value for Liberal Arts to be in&s;en&s;ible, that true Fame lies only in the Hands of Learned Men, by whom it is to be tran&s;mitted to Futurity, with Marks of Ho|nour or Reproach to the End of Time. The Date of Humane Life is too &s;hort to recompence the Cares which attend the mo&s;t private Condi|tion: Therefore it is, that our Souls are made as it were too big for it, and extend them&s;elves in the Pro&s;pect of a longer Exi&s;tence, in a good Fame and Memory of worthy Actions after our Decea&s;e. The whole Race of Men have this Pa&s;&s;ion in &s;ome Degree implanted in their Bo|&s;oms, which is the &s;tronge&s;t and noble&s;t Incita|tion to hone&s;t Attempts: But the ba&s;e U&s;e of the Arts of Peace, Eloquence, Poetry, and all the Parts of Learning, have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Souls &s;o unworthy tho&s;e Faculties, that the Names and Appellations of Things have been confounded by the Labours and Writings of pro|&s;tituted Men, who have &s;tamp'd a Reputation upon &s;uch Actions, as are in them&s;elves the Ob|jects of Contempt and Di&s;grace. This is that which has mi&s;led your Maje&s;ty in the Conduct of your Reign, and made that Life, which might have been the mo&s;t imitable, the mo&s;t to be a|voided. To this it is, that the great and excel|lent Qualities of which your Maje&s;ty is Ma&s;ter, are lo&s;t in their Application; and your Maje&s;ty has been carrying on for many Years the mo&s;t
<PB N="168" REF="179">
cruel Tyranny, with all the noble Methods which are u&s;ed to &s;upport a ju&s;t Reign. Thus it is, that it avails nothing that you are a Bountiful Ma&s;ter; that you are &s;o Generous as to reward even the Un&s;ucce&s;sful with Honour and Riches; that no laudable Action pa&s;&s;es unrewarded in your King|doms; that you have &s;earched all Nations for ob&s;cure Merit. In a Word, that you are in your private Character endowed with every Princely Quality, when all this is &s;ubjected to unju&s;t and ill-taught Ambition, which to the Injury of the World, is gilded by tho&s;e Endowments. How|ever, if your Maje&s;ty will conde&s;cend to look into your own Soul, and con&s;ider all its Facul|ties and Weakne&s;&s;es with Impartiality; if you will but be convinced, that Life is &s;upported in you by the ordinary Methods of Food, Re&s;t, and Sleep; you would think it impo&s;&s;ible that you could ever be &s;o much impo&s;ed on, as to have been wrought into a Belief, that &s;o many Thou|&s;ands of the &s;ame Make with your &s;elf were formed by Providence for no other End, but by the Hazard of their very Being to extend the Conque&s;ts and Glory of an Individual of their own Species. A very little Reflection will con|vince your Maje&s;ty, that &s;uch cannot be the In|tent of the Creator; and if not, What Horror mu&s;t it give your Maje&s;ty to think of the va&s;t Deva&s;tations your Ambition has made among your Fellow-Creatures? While the Warmth of Youth, the Flattery of Crowds, and a continual Series of Succe&s;s and Triumph, indulged your Maje&s;ty in this Allu&s;ion of Mind, it was le&s;s to be wondered at, that you proceeded in this mi|&s;taken Pur&s;uit of Grandeur; but when Age, Di&s;appointments, Publick Calamities, Per&s;onal Di&s;tempers, and the Rever&s;e of all that makes Men forget their true Being, are fallen upon you: Heavens! Is it po&s;&s;ible you can live with|out

<P>Your Maje&s;ty will ob&s;erve, I do not bring a|gain&s;t you a railing Accu&s;ation; but as you are a &s;trict Profe&s;&s;or of Religion, I be&s;eech your Ma|je&s;ty to &s;top the Effu&s;ion of Blood, by receiving the Opportunity which pre&s;ents it &s;elf, for the Pre&s;ervation of your di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People.

<P>IN my Paper of the 28th of the la&s;t Month, I mentioned &s;everal Characters which want Explanation to the Generality of Readers: A|mong others, I &s;poke of a Pretty Fellow. I have &s;ince received a kind Admonition in a Letter, to take Care that I do not omit to &s;how al&s;o what is meant by a <HI>very</HI> Pretty Fellow, which is to be allowed as a Character by it &s;elf, and a Per&s;on exalted above the other by a peculiar Sprightli|ne&s;s; as one who, by a di&s;tingui&s;hing Vigour, out&s;trips his Companions, and has thereby de|&s;erved and obtained a particular Appellation, or Nick-name of Familiarity. Some have this Di|&s;tinction from the Fair Sex, who are &s;o generous as to take into their Protection &s;uch as are laugh|ed at by the Men, and place them for that Rea|&s;on in Degrees of Favour.</P>
<P>The chief of this Sort is Colonel <HI>Brunett,</HI> who is a Man of Fa&s;hion, becau&s;e he will be &s;o; and practi&s;es a very janty Way of Behaviour, becau&s;e he is too carele&s;s to know when he offends, and too &s;anguine to be mortified if he did know it. Thus the Colonel has met with a Town ready to receive him, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee why he &s;hould not make u&s;e of their Favour, and &s;et him&s;elf in the Fir&s;t Degree of Conver&s;ation. Therefore he is very &s;ucce&s;sfully loud among the Wits, fami|liar among the Ladies, and di&s;&s;olute among the Rakes. Thus he is admitted in one Place, be|cau&s;e he is &s;o in another; and every Man treats <HI>Brunett</HI> well, not out of his particular E&s;teem
<PB N="171" REF="182">
for him, but in Re&s;pect to the Opinion of others. It is to me a &s;olid Plea&s;ure to &s;ee the World thus mi&s;taken on the good-natur'd Side; for 'tis Ten to One but the Colonel mounts into a General Officer, marries a fine Lady, and is Ma&s;ter of a good E&s;tate, before they come to explain upon him. What gives mo&s;t Delight to me in this Ob|&s;ervation, is, that all this ari&s;es from pure Na|ture, and the Colonel can account for his Suc|ce&s;s no more than tho&s;e by whom he &s;ucceeds. For the&s;e Cau&s;es and Con&s;iderations, I pronounce him a true Woman's Man, and in the fir&s;t De|gree, <HI>A very pretty Fellow.</HI></P>
<P>The next to a Man of this univer&s;al Genius, is one who is peculiarly formed for the Service of the Ladies, and his Merit chiefly is to be of no Con&s;equence. I am indeed a little in Doubt, Whe|ther he ought not rather to be called a <HI>very Happy,</HI> than a <HI>very Pretty</HI> Fellow? For he is admitted at all Hours: All he &s;ays or does, which would of|fend in another, are pa&s;&s;ed over in him; and all Actions and Speeches which plea&s;e, doubly plea&s;e if they come from him: No one wonders or takes Notice when he's wrong; but all admire him when he's in the Right.&mdash;By the Way it is fit to remark, That there are People of better Sen&s;e than the&s;e, who endeavour at this Character; but they are out of Nature; and tho', with &s;ome Indu&s;try, they get the Characters of Fools, they cannot ar|rive to be <HI>very,</HI> &s;eldom to be meerly <HI>Pretty Fel|lows.</HI> But where Nature has formed a Per&s;on for this Station among&s;t Men, he is gifted with a pe|culiar Genius for Succe&s;s, and his very Errors and Ab&s;urdities contribute to it; this Felicity attend|ing him to his Life's End. For it being in a Man|ner nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould be of no Con&s;equence, he is as well in old Age as Youth; and I know a Man, who&s;e Son has been &s;ome Years a pretty Fellow, who is him&s;elf at this Hour a <HI>very</HI> Pretty Fellow.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="183">
One mu&s;t move tenderly in this Place, for we are now in the Ladies Lodgings, and &s;peaking of &s;uch as are &s;upported by their Influence and Fa|vour; again&s;t which there is not, neither ought there to be, any Di&s;pute or Ob&s;ervation. But when we come into more free Air, one may talk a little more at large.</P>
<P>Give me Leave then to mention Three, whom I do not doubt but we &s;hall &s;ee make con&s;iderable Figures; and the&s;e are &s;uch as, for their <HI>Baccha|nalian</HI> Performances, mu&s;t be admitted into this Order. They are Three Brothers lately landed from <HI>Holland:</HI> As yet, indeed, they have not made their publick Entry, but lodge and con|ver&s;e at <HI>Wapping.</HI> They have merited already on the Water-&s;ide particular Titles: The Fir&s;t is cal|led <HI>Hog&s;head;</HI> the Second, <HI>Culverin;</HI> and the Third, <HI>Mu&s;quet.</HI> This Fraternity is preparing for our End of the Town by their Ability in the Ex|erci&s;es of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and mea&s;ure their Time and Merit by Liquid Weight, and Power of Drink|ing. <HI>Hog&s;head</HI> is a prettier Fellow than <HI>Culverin</HI> by Two Quarts, and <HI>Culverin</HI> than <HI>Mu&s;quet</HI> by a full Pint. It is to be feared, <HI>Hog&s;head</HI> is &s;o often too full, and <HI>Culverin</HI> over-loaded, that <HI>Mu&s;quet</HI> will be the only la&s;ting <HI>very</HI> Pretty Fellow of the Three.</P>
<P>A Third Sort of this Denomination are &s;uch as, by very daring Adventures in Love, have pur|cha&s;ed to them&s;elves Renown and new Names; as, <HI>Jo. Carry,</HI> for his exce&s;&s;ive Strength and Vi|gour; <HI>Tom Drybones,</HI> for his generous Lo&s;s of Youth and Health; and <HI>Cancrum,</HI> for his meri|torious Rottenne&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e great and leading Spirits are propo&s;ed to all &s;uch of our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Youth as would arrive at Perfection in the&s;e different Kinds; and if their Parts and Accompli&s;hments were well imi|tated, it is not doubted but that our Nation
<PB N="173" REF="184">
would &s;oon excel all others it Wit and Arts, as they already do in Arms.</P>
<P>[<HI>N. B.</HI> The Gentleman who &s;tole <HI>Betty Pepin,</HI> may own it, for he is allowed to be a <HI>very</HI> Pret|ty Fellow.]</P>
<P><HI>But we mu&s;t proceed to the Explanation of other Terms in our Writings.</HI></P>
<P>To know what a Toa&s;t is in the Country, gives as much Perplexity as &s;he her &s;elf does in Town: And indeed, the Learned differ very much upon the Original of this Word, and the Acceptation of it among the Moderns. However, it is by all agreed to have a joyous and chearful Import. A Toa&s;t in a cold Morning, heightened by Nutmeg, and &s;weeten'd with Sugar, has for many Ages been given to our Rural Di&s;pen&s;ers of Ju&s;tice, before they enter'd upon Cau&s;es, and has been of great and politick U&s;e to take off the Severi|ty of their Sentences; but has indeed been remarkable for one ill Effect, that it inclines tho&s;e who u&s;e it immoderately, to &s;peak <HI>Latin,</HI> to the Admiration, rather than Information, of an Audience. This Application of a Toa&s;t makes it very obvious, that the Word may, without a Metaphor, be under&s;tood as an apt Name for a Thing which rai&s;es us in the mo&s;t &s;overeign De|gree. But many of the Wits of the la&s;t Age will a&s;&s;ert, That the Word, in its pre&s;ent Sen&s;e, was known among them in their Youth, and had its Ri&s;e from an Accident at the Town of <HI>Bath,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>It happened, that on a Publick Day a celebra|ted Beauty of tho&s;e Times was in the <HI>Cro&s;s Bath,</HI> and one of the Crowd of her Admirers took a Gla&s;s of the Water in which the Fair One &s;tood, and drank her Health to the Company. There was in the Place a Gay Fellow, half fuddled, who offered to jump in, and &s;wore, Tho' he liked not
<PB N="174" REF="185">
the Liquor, he would have the Toa&s;t. He was oppo&s;ed in his Re&s;olution; yet this Whim gave Foundation to the pre&s;ent Honour which is done to the Lady we mention in our Liquors, who has ever &s;ince been called a <HI>Toa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' this In&s;titution had &s;o trivial a Beginning, it is now elevated into a formal Order; and that happy Virgin who is received and drank to at their Meetings, has no more to do in this Life, but to judge and accept of the fir&s;t good Offer. The Manner of her Inauguration is much like that of the Choice of a Doge in <HI>Venice:</HI> It is per|formed by Ballotting; and when &s;he is &s;o cho|&s;en, &s;he reigns indi&s;putably for that en&s;uing Year; but mu&s;t be elected anew to prolong her Empire a Moment beyond it. When &s;he is regularly cho|&s;en, her Name is written with a Diamond on a Drinking-gla&s;s. The Hieroglyphick of the Dia|mond is to &s;hew her, that her Value is imaginary; and that of the Gla&s;s to acquaint her, that her Condition is frail, and depends on the Hand which holds her. This wi&s;e De&s;ign admoni&s;hes her, nei|ther to over-rate or depreciate her Charms; as well con&s;idering and applying, that it is perfect|ly according to the Humour and Ta&s;te of the Company, whether the Toa&s;t is eaten, or left as an Offal.</P>
<P>The Foremo&s;t of the whole Rank of Toa&s;ts, and the mo&s;t undi&s;puted in their pre&s;ent Empire, are Mrs. <HI>Gatty</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Frontlet:</HI> The Fir&s;t an Agreeable, the Second an Awful Beauty. The&s;e Ladies are perfect Friends, out of a Knowledge, that their Perfections are too different to &s;tand in Competition. He that likes <HI>Gatty,</HI> can have no Reli&s;h for &s;o &s;olemn a Creature as <HI>Frontlet;</HI> and an Admirer of <HI>Frontlet,</HI> will call <HI>Gatty</HI> a May|pole Girl. <HI>Gatty</HI> for ever &s;miles upon you; and <HI>Frontlet</HI> di&s;dains to &s;ee you &s;mile. <HI>Gatty</HI>'s Love is a &s;hining quick Flame; <HI>Frontlet</HI>'s a &s;low wa&s;t|ing
<PB N="175" REF="186">
Fire. <HI>Gatty</HI> likes the Man that diverts her; <HI>Frontlet</HI> him who adores her. <HI>Gatty</HI> always im|proves the Soil in which &s;he travels; <HI>Frontlet</HI> lays wa&s;te the Country. <HI>Gatty</HI> does not only &s;mile, but laughs at her Lover; <HI>Frontlet</HI> not only looks &s;erious, but frowns at him. All the Men of Wit, (and Coxcombs their Followers) are profe&s;&s;ed Servants of <HI>Gatty:</HI> The Politicians and Pretenders give &s;olemn Wor&s;hip to <HI>Frontlet.</HI> Their Reign will be be&s;t judged of by its Dura|tion. <HI>Frontlet</HI> will never be cho&s;en more; and <HI>Gatty</HI> is a Toa&s;t for Life.</P>

<P>A Letter from a young Lady, written in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Terms, wherein &s;he laments the Misfortune of a Gentleman, her Lover, who was lately wounded in a Duel, has turned my Thoughts to that Subject, and enclined me to examine into the Cau&s;es which precipitate Men into &s;o fatal a Folly. And as it has been propo|&s;ed to treat of Subjects of Gallantry in the Arti|cle from hence, and no one Point in Nature is more proper to be con&s;ider'd by the Company who frequent this Place than that of Duels, it is worth our Con&s;ideration to examine into this Chimaerical groundle&s;s Humour, and to lay every other Thought a&s;ide, till we have &s;trip'd it of all its fal&s;e Pretences to Credit and Reputation among&s;t Men.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t confe&s;s, when I con&s;ider what I am going about, and run over in my Imagination all the endle&s;s Crowd of Men of Honour who will be offended at &s;uch a Di&s;cour&s;e; I am underta|king, methinks, a Work worthy an invulnerable Hero in Romance, rather than a private Gentle|man with a &s;ingle Rapier: But as I am pretty well acquainted by great Opportunities with the Nature of Man, and know of a Truth, that all Men fight <HI>again&s;t their Will,</HI> the Danger vani&s;hes, and Re&s;olution ri&s;es upon this Subject. For this Rea&s;on I &s;hall talk very freely on a Cu&s;tom which all Men wi&s;h exploded, though no Man has Courage enough to re&s;i&s;t it.</P>
<P>But there is one unintelligible Word which I fear will extremely perplex my Di&s;&s;ertation; and
<PB N="179" REF="192">
I confe&s;s to you I find very hard to explain, which is, the Term <HI>Satisfaction.</HI> An hone&s;t Country Gentleman had the Misfortune to fall into Com|pany with Two or Three modern Men of Honour, where he happened to be very ill treated; and one of the Company being con&s;cious of his Of|fence, &s;ends a Note to him in the Morning, and tells him, He was ready to give him Satisfaction. This is fine Doing (&s;ays the plain Fellow). La&s;t Night he &s;ent me away cur&s;edly out of Humour, and this Morning he fancies it would be a Sati&s;|faction to be run through the Body.</P>
<P>As the Matter at pre&s;ent &s;tands, it is not to do hand&s;ome Actions denominates a Man of Honour; it is enough if he dares to defend ill Ones. Thus you often &s;ee a common Sharper in Competition with a Gentleman of the fir&s;t Rank; though all Mankind is convinced, that a fighting Game&s;ter is only a Pick-pocket with the Courage of an Highway-Man. One cannot with any Patience reflect on the unaccountable Jumble of Per&s;ons and Things in this Town and Nation, which oc|ca&s;ions very frequently, that a brave Man falls by a Hand below that of the common Hangman, and yet his Executioner e&s;capes the Clutches of the Hangman for doing it. I &s;hall therefore here|after con&s;ider, how the brave&s;t Men in other Ages and Nations have behaved them&s;elves upon &s;uch Incidents as we decide by Combat; and &s;how, from their Practice, that this Re&s;entment neither has its Foundation from true Rea&s;on, or &s;olid Fame; but is an Impo&s;ture, made up of Cowar|dice, Fal&s;hood, and Want of Under&s;tanding. For this Work, a good Hi&s;tory of Quarrels would be very edifying to the Publick, and I apply my &s;elf to the Town for Particulars and Circum|&s;tances within their Knowledge, which may &s;erve to embelli&s;h the Di&s;&s;ertation with proper Cuts. Mo&s;t of the Quarrels I have ever known,
<PB N="180" REF="193">
have proceeded from &s;ome valiant Coxcomb's per|&s;i&s;ting in the Wrong, to defend &s;ome prevailing Folly, and pre&s;erve him&s;elf from the Ingenuity of owning a Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>By this Means it is called, <HI>Giving a Man Sati&s;|faction,</HI> to urge your Offence again&s;t him with your Sword; which puts me in Mind of <HI>Peter</HI>'s Order to the Keeper, in <HI>The Tale of a Tub: If you neglect to do all this, damn you and your Gene|ration for ever; and &s;o we bid you heartily fare|wel.</HI> If the Contradiction in the very Terms of one of our Challenges were as well explained, and turn'd into downright <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> would it not run after this Manner?</P>

<P>YOur extraordinary Behaviour la&s;t Night, and the Liberty you were plea&s;ed to take with me, makes me this Morning give you this, to tell you, becau&s;e you are an ill-bred Puppy, I will meet you in <HI>Hide-Park</HI> an Hour hence; and becau&s;e you want both Breeding and Hu|manity, I de&s;ire you would come with a Pi&s;tol in your Hand, on Hor&s;eback, and endeavour to &s;hoot me through the Head; to teach you more Manners.

<P>Among the many Employments I am nece&s;&s;a|rily put upon by my Friends, that of giving Ad|vice
<PB N="181" REF="194">
is the mo&s;t unwelcome to me; and indeed, I am forced to u&s;e a little Art in the Matter; for &s;ome People will ask Coun&s;el of you, when they have already acted what they tell you is &s;till un|der Deliberation. I had almo&s;t lo&s;t a very good Friend t'other Day, who came to know how I liked his De&s;ign to marry &s;uch a Lady. I an|&s;wered, By no Means; and I mu&s;t be po&s;itive a|gain&s;t it, for very &s;olid Rea&s;ous, which are not proper to communicate. Not proper to commu|nicate! (&s;aid he with a grave Air) I will know the Bottom of this. I &s;aw him moved, and knew from thence he was already determined; there|fore evaded it by &s;aying, To tell you the Truth, dear <HI>Frank,</HI> Of all Women living, I would have her my &s;elf. <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> &s;aid he, Thou art too late, for we have been both one the&s;e two Months.</P>
<P>I learned this Caution by a Gentleman's con|&s;ulting me formerly about his Son. He railed at his damn'd Extravagance, and told me, In a very little Time, he would beggar him by the exor|bitant Bills which came from <HI>Oxford</HI> every Quar|ter. <HI>Make the Rogue bite upon the Bridle,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>pay none of his Bills, it will but encourage him to further Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</HI> He look'd plaguy &s;owr at me. His Son &s;oon after &s;ent up a Paper of Ver&s;es, for&s;ooth, in Print, on the la&s;t publick Occa&s;ion; upon which, he is convinced the Boy has Parts, and a Lad of Spirit is not to be too much cramp'd in his Maintenance, le&s;t he take ill Cour&s;es. Nei|ther Father nor Son can ever &s;ince endure the Sight of me.</P>
<P>The&s;e Sort of People ask Opinions, only out of the Fulne&s;s of their Heart on the Subject of their Perplexity, and not from a De&s;ire of Infor|mation.</P>
<P>There is nothing &s;o ea&s;y as to find out which Opinion the Per&s;on in Doubt has a Mind to; therefore the &s;ure Way is to tell him, that is cer|tainly
<PB N="182" REF="195">
to be cho&s;en. Then you are to be very clear and po&s;itive; leave no Handle for Scruple. Ble&s;s me! Sir, there's no Room for a Que&s;tion. This rivets you into his Heart; for you at once applaud his Wi&s;dom, and gratify his Inclination. However, I had too much Bowels to be in&s;incere to a Man who came Ye&s;terday to know of me, With which of two eminent Men in the City he &s;hould place his Son? Their Names are <HI>Paulo</HI> and <HI>Avaro.</HI> This gave me much Debate with my &s;elf, becau&s;e not only the Fortune of the Youth, but his Virtue al&s;o, depended upon this Choice. The Men are equally wealthy; but they differ in the U&s;e and Application of their Riches, which you immediately &s;ee upon entring their Doors.</P>
<P>The Habitation of <HI>Paulo</HI> has at once the Air of a Nobleman and a Merchant. You &s;ee the Servants act with Affection to their Ma&s;ter, and Satisfaction in them&s;elves: The Ma&s;ter meets you with an open Countenance, full of Benevo|lence and Integrity: Your Bu&s;ine&s;s is di&s;patched with that Confidence and Welcome which al|ways accompanies hone&s;t Minds: His Table is the Image of Plenty and Genero&s;ity, &s;upported by Ju&s;tice and Frugality. After we had dined here, our Affair was to vi&s;it <HI>Avaro:</HI> Out comes an aukward Fellow with a careful Countenance; Sir, Would you &s;peak with my Ma&s;ter? May I crave your Name? After the fir&s;t Preambles, he leads us into a noble Solitude, a great Hou&s;e that &s;eem'd uninhabited; but from the End of the &s;pacious Hall moves towards us <HI>Avaro,</HI> with a &s;u&s;picious A&s;pect, as if he believed us Thieves; and as for my Part, I approached him as if I knew him a Cut-pur&s;e. We fell into Di&s;cour&s;e of his noble Dwelling, and the Great E&s;tate all the World knew he had to enjoy in it: And I, to plague him, fell a commending <HI>Paulo</HI>'s Way
<PB N="183" REF="196">
of Living. <HI>Paulo,</HI> an&s;wered <HI>Avaro,</HI> is a very good Man; but we who have &s;maller E&s;tates, mu&s;t cut our Coat according to our Cloth. Nay, &s;ays I, Every Man knows his own Circum&s;tance be&s;t; you are in the Right, if you han't where|withal. He look'd very &s;owr; (for it is, you mu&s;t know, the utmo&s;t Vanity of a mean|&s;pi|rited rich Man to be contradicted, when he calls him&s;elf Poor.) But I was re&s;olved to vex him, by con&s;enting to all he &s;aid; the main De&s;ign of which was, that he would have us find out, he was one of the wealthie&s;t Men in <HI>London,</HI> and lived like a Beggar. We left him, and took a Turn on the Change. My Friend was ravi&s;hed with <HI>Avaro:</HI> This (&s;aid he) is cer|tainly a &s;ure Man. I contradicted him with much Warmth, and &s;ummed up their different Characters as well as I could. This <HI>Paulo</HI> (&s;aid I) grows wealthy by being a common Good; <HI>Avaro,</HI> by being a general Evil: <HI>Paulo</HI> has the Art, <HI>Avaro</HI> the Craft of Trade. When <HI>Paulo</HI> gains, all Men he deals with are the better: Whenever <HI>Avaro</HI> profits, another certainly lo&s;es. In a Word, <HI>Paulo</HI> is a Citizen, and <HI>Avaro</HI> a Cit. I convinced my Friend, and carried the young Gentleman the next Day to <HI>Paulo,</HI> where he will learn the Way both to gain, and enjoy a good Fortune. And tho' I cannot &s;ay, I have, by keep|ing him from <HI>Avaro,</HI> &s;aved him from the Gal|lows, I have prevented his de&s;erving it every Day he lives: For with <HI>Paulo</HI> he will be an hone&s;t Man, without being &s;o for Fear of the Law; as with <HI>Avaro,</HI> he would have been a Villain with|in the Protection of it.</P>

I thought Liberal Men would not be &s;uch Time|&s;ervers, as to fall upon a Man becau&s;e his Friends are not in Power. But having &s;ome Concern for what you may tran&s;mit to Po&s;terity con|cerning me, I am willing to keep Terms with you, and make a Reque&s;t to you, which is, That you would give my Service to the Nineteenth Century, (if ever you or yours reach to them) and tell them, That I have &s;ettled all Matters between them and me by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Boileau.</HI> I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee you here.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>It is very odd this Prince &s;hould offer to invite me into his Dominions, or believe I &s;hould accept the Invitation. No, no, I remember too well how he &s;erved an ingenious Gentleman, a Friend of mine, whom he locked up in the <HI>Ba&s;tile</HI> for no Rea&s;on in the World, but becau&s;e he was a Wit, and feared he might mention him with Ju&s;tice in &s;ome of his Writings. His Way is, That all Men of Sen&s;e are preferred, bani&s;hed, or impri&s;oned. He has indeed a Sort of Ju&s;tice in him, like that of the Game&s;ters; for if a Stander-by &s;ees one at Play cheat, he has a Right to come in for Shares, as knowing the My&s;teries of the Game.</P>
<P>This is a very wi&s;e and ju&s;t Maxim; and if I have not left at Mr. <HI>Morphew</HI>'s, directed to me, Bank Bills for 200 <HI>l.</HI> on or before this Day Seven|night, I &s;hall tell how <HI>Tom Ca&s;h</HI> got his E&s;tate.
<PB N="189" REF="202">
I expect Three Hundred Pounds of Mr. <HI>Soilett,</HI> for concealing all the Money he has lent to him|&s;elf, and his Landed Friend bound with him, at Thirty <HI>per Cent.</HI> at his Scrivener's. Ab&s;olute Prin|ces make People pay what they plea&s;e in Defe|rence to their Power: I do not know why I &s;hould not do the &s;ame, out of Fear or Re&s;pect to my Knowledge. I always pre&s;erve Decorums and Civilities to the Fair Sex: Therefore if a cer|tain Lady, who left her Coach at the <HI>New Ex|change</HI> Door in the <HI>Strand,</HI> and whipt down <HI>Dur|ham-Yard</HI> into a Boat with a young Gentleman for <HI>Fox-Hall;</HI> I &s;ay, if &s;he will &s;end me Word, that I may give the Fan which &s;he drop'd, and I found, to my Si&s;ter <HI>Jenny,</HI> there &s;hall be no more &s;aid of it. I expect Hu&s;h-Money to be regu|larly &s;ent for every Folly or Vice any one com|mits in this whole Town; and hope, I may pre|tend to de&s;erve it better than a Chamber-Maid, or Valet de Chambre: They only whi&s;per it to the little Set of their Companions; but I can tell it to all Men living, or who are to live. There|fore I de&s;ire all my Readers to pay their Fines, or mend their Lives.</P>

<P>My Familiar being come from <HI>France,</HI> with an An&s;wer to my Letter to <HI>Lewis</HI> of that Kingdom, in&s;tead of going on in a Di&s;cour&s;e of what he had &s;een in that Court, he put on the imme|diate Concern of a Guardian, and fell to enqui|ring into my Thoughts and Adventures &s;ince his Journey. As &s;hort as his Stay had been, I confe&s;s'd I had had many Occa&s;ions for his A&s;|&s;i&s;tance in my Conduct; but communicated to him my Thoughts of putting all my Force a|gain&s;t the horrid and &s;en&s;ele&s;s Cu&s;tom of Duels; If it were po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, to laugh at Things in them&s;elves &s;o deeply Tragical as the imperti|nent Profu&s;ion of Humane Life, I think I could

divert you with a Figure I &s;aw ju&s;t after my Death, when the Philo&s;opher threw me, as I told you &s;ome Days ago, into the Pail of Water.</P>
<Q>You are to know, That when Men leave the Body, there are Receptacles for them as &s;oon as they depart, according to the Manner in which they lived and died. At the very In&s;tant that I was killed, there came away with me a Spirit which had lo&s;t its Body in a Duel. We were both examined. Me, the whole A&s;&s;em|bly looked at with Kindne&s;s and Pity, but at the &s;ame Time with an Air of Welcome, and Con&s;olation: They pronounced me very happy, who had died in Innocence; and told me, a quite different Place was allotted to me, than that which was appointed for my Companion; there being a great Di&s;tance from the Man&s;ions of Fools and Innocents: Tho' at the &s;ame Time, &s;aid one of the Gho&s;ts, there is a great Affinity between an Idiot who has been &s;o for long Life, and a Child who departs before Maturity. But this Gentleman who has arrived with you is a Fool of his own making, is ignorant out of Choice, and will fare accordingly. The A&s;&s;embly began to flock about him, and one &s;aid to him, Sir, I ob&s;erved you came into the Gate of Per|&s;ons murdered, and I de&s;ire to know, What brought you to your untimely End? He &s;aid, He had been a Second. <HI>Socrates</HI> (who may be &s;aid to have been murdered by the Commonwealth of <HI>Athens</HI>) &s;tood by, and began to draw near him, in order, after his Manner, to lead him into a Sen&s;e of his Error by Conce&s;&s;ions in his own Di&s;cour&s;e. <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid that Divine and Amicable Spirit, <HI>What was the Quarrel?</HI> He an&s;wered, <HI>We &s;hall know very &s;uddenly, when the Princi|pal in the Bu&s;ine&s;s comes, for he was de&s;perately wounded before I fell. Sir,</HI> &s;aid the Sage, <HI>Had you an E&s;tate? Yes, Sir,</HI> the new Gue&s;t an&s;wer|ed,
<PB N="191" REF="204">
<HI>I have left it in a very good Condition, and made my Will the Night before this Occa&s;ion.</HI> Did you read it before you &s;ign'd it? Yes &s;ure, Sir, &s;aid the new Comer. <HI>Socrates</HI> replies, Could a Man, that would not give his E&s;tate without reading the In&s;trument, di&s;po&s;e of his Life with|out asking a Que&s;tion? That illu&s;trious Shade turned from him, and a Crowd of impertinent Goblins, who had been Droles and Para&s;ites in their Life-time, and were knock'd on the Head for their Sawcine&s;s, came about my Fellow-Traveller, and made them&s;elves very merry with Que&s;tions about the Words <HI>Cart</HI> and <HI>Terce,</HI> and other Terms of Fencers. But his Thoughts began to &s;ettle into Reflection upon the Adventure which had robbed him of his late Being; and with a wretched Sigh, &s;aid he, <HI>How terrible are Conviction and Guilt when they come too late for Penitence!</HI></Q>
<P><HI>Pacolet</HI> was going on in this Strain, but he re|covered from it, and told me, <Q>It was too &s;oon to give my Di&s;cour&s;e on this Subject &s;o &s;erious a Turn; you have chiefly to do with that Part of Mankind which mu&s;t be led into Reflection by Degrees, and you mu&s;t treat this Cu&s;tom with Humour and Raillery to get an Audience, before you come to pronounce Sentence upon it. There is Foundation enough for rai&s;ing &s;uch Entertainments from the Practice on this Occa|&s;ion. Don't you know, that often a Man is cal|led out of Bed to follow implicitly a Coxcomb (with whom he would not keep Company on any other Occa&s;ion) to Ruin and Death?&mdash;Then a good Li&s;t of &s;uch as are qualified by the Laws of the&s;e uncourteous Men of Chivalry to enter into Combat (who are often Per&s;ons of Honour without common Hone&s;ty): The&s;e, I &s;ay, ran|ged and drawn up in their proper Order, would give an Aver&s;ion to doing any Thing in com|mon
<PB N="192" REF="205">
with &s;uch as Men laugh at and contemn. But to go through this Work, you mu&s;t not let your Thoughts vary, or make Excur&s;ions from your Theme: Con&s;ider at the &s;ame Time, that the Matter has been often treated by the able&s;t and greate&s;t Writers; yet that mu&s;t not di&s;en|courage you; for the propere&s;t Per&s;on to handle it, is one who has roved into mix'd Conver&s;a|tions, and mu&s;t have Opportunities (which I &s;hall give you) of &s;eeing the&s;e Sort of Men in their Plea&s;ures and Gratifications; among which, they pretend to reckon Fighting. It was plea&s;antly enough &s;aid of a Bully in <HI>France,</HI> when Duels fir&s;t began to be puni&s;hed: The King has taken away Gaming, and Stage-play|ing, and now Fighting too; How does he ex|pect Gentlemen &s;hall divert them&s;elves?</Q></P>

<P><HI>PAcolet</HI> being gone a &s;trolling among the Men of the Sword, in order to find out the &s;ecret Cau&s;es of the frequent Di&s;putes we meet with, and furni&s;h me with Materials for my Treati&s;e on Duelling; I have Room left to go on in my Information to my Country Readers, whereby they may under&s;tand the bright Peo|ple who&s;e Memoirs I have taken upon me to write. But in my Di&s;cour&s;e of the 28th of the la&s;t Month, I omitted to mention the mo&s;t agreeable of all bad Characters; and that is, a <HI>Rake.</HI></P>
<P>A Rake is a Man always to be pitied; and if he lives, is one Day certainly reclaimed; for
<PB N="193" REF="206">
his Faults proceed not from Choice or Inclina|tion, but from &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ions and Appetites' which are in Youth too violent for the Club of Rea&s;on, good Sen&s;e, good Manners, and good Nature: All which he mu&s;t have by Nature and Education, before he can be allowed to be, or have been of this Order. He is a poor un|weildy Wretch, that commits Faults out of the Redundance of his good Qualities. His Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion makes him &s;ometimes a Bub|ble to all his Fellows, let 'em be never &s;o much below him in Under&s;tanding. His De&s;ires run away with him through the Strength and Force of a lively Imagination, which hurries him on to unlawful Plea&s;ures, before Rea&s;on has Power to come in to his Re&s;cue. Thus, with all the good Intentions in the World to A|mendment, this Creature &s;ins on again&s;t Hea|ven, him&s;elf, his Friends, and his Country, who all call for a better U&s;e of his Talents. There is not a Being under the Sun &s;o mi&s;e|rable as this: He goes on in a Pur&s;uit he him|&s;elf di&s;approves, and has no Enjoyment but what is followed by Remor&s;e; no Relief from Remor&s;e, but the Repetition of his Crime. It's po&s;&s;ible I may talk of this Per&s;on with too much Indulgence; but I mu&s;t repeat it, that I think this, a Character which is the mo&s;t the Object of Pity of any in the World. The Man in the Pangs of the Stone, Gout, or any acute Di&s;tem|pers, is not in &s;o deplorable a Condition in the Eye of right Sen&s;e, as he that errs and repents, and repents and errs on. The Fellow with bro|ken Limbs ju&s;tly de&s;erves your Alms for his impotent Condition; but he that can't u&s;e his own Rea&s;on, is in a much wor&s;e State; for you &s;ee him in mi&s;erable Circum&s;tances, with his Remedy at the &s;ame Time in his own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, if he would or could u&s;e it. This is the Cau&s;e
<PB N="194" REF="207">
that, of all ill Characters, the Rake has the be&s;t Quarter in the World; for when he is him&s;elf, and unruffled with Intemperance, you &s;ee his natural Faculties exert them&s;elves, and attract an Eye of Favour towards his Infirmities.</P>
<P>But if we look round us here, how many dull Rogues are there, that would fain be what this poor Man hates him&s;elf for? All the Noi&s;e towards Six in the Evening, is cau&s;ed by his Mimicks and Imitators. How ought Men of Sen&s;e to be careful of their Actions, if it were meerly from the Indignation of &s;eeing them|&s;elves ill drawn by &s;uch little Pretenders? Not to &s;ay, he that leads, is guilty of all the Actions of his Followers: And a Rake has Imitators whom you would never expect &s;hould prove &s;o-Second-hand Vice &s;ure of all is the mo&s;t nau&s;e|ous. There is hardly a Folly more ab&s;urd, or which &s;eems le&s;s to be accounted for, (tho' 'tis what we &s;ee every Day) than that grave and hone&s;t Natures give into this Way, and at the &s;ame Time have good Sen&s;e, if they thought fit to u&s;e it: But the Fatality (under which mo&s;t Men labour) of de&s;iring to be what they are not, makes 'em go out of a Method, in which they might be received with Applau&s;e, and would certainly excel; into one, wherein they will all their Life have the Air of Strangers to what they aim at.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, I have not lamented the Me|tamorpho&s;is of any one I know &s;o much as of <HI>No|bilis,</HI> who was born with Sweetne&s;s of Temper, ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ion, and every Thing el&s;e that might make him a Man fit for his Order. But in&s;tead of the Pur&s;uit of &s;ober Studies, and Ap|plications, in which he would certainly be capa|ble of making a con&s;iderable Figure in the noble&s;t A&s;&s;embly of Men in the World; I &s;ay, in &s;pight of that good Nature, which is his proper Bent,
<PB N="195" REF="208">
he will &s;ay ill-natured Things aloud, put &s;uch as he was, and &s;till &s;hould be, out of Countenance, and drown all the natural Good in him, to re|ceive an artificial ill Character, in which he will never &s;ucceed: For <HI>Nobilis</HI> is no Rake. He may guzzle as much Wine as he plea&s;es, talk Bawdy if he thinks fit; but he may as well drink Wa|ter-gruel, and go twice a Day to Church, for it will never do. I pronounce it again, <HI>Nobilis</HI> is no Rake. To be of that Order, he mu&s;t be vi|cious again&s;t his Will, and not &s;o by Study or Application. All Pretty Fellows are al&s;o excluded to a Man, as well as all Inamaratoes, or Per&s;ons of the Epicene Gender, who gaze at one another in the Pre&s;ence of Ladies. This Cla&s;s, of which I am giving you an Account, is pretended to al&s;o by Men of &s;trong Abilities in Drinking; tho' they are &s;uch whom the Liquor, not the Conver&s;ation, keeps together. But Blockheads may roar, fight, and &s;tab, and be never the nearer; their Labour is al&s;o lo&s;t; they want Sen&s;e: They are no Rakes.</P>
<P>As a Rake among Men is the Man who lives in the con&s;tant Abu&s;e of his Rea&s;on, &s;o a Co|quet among Women is one who lives in con|tinual Mi&s;application of her Beauty. The chief of all, whom I have the Honour to be acquain|ted with, is pretty Mrs. <HI>To&s;s:</HI> She is ever in Practice of &s;omething which disfigures her, and takes from her Charms; tho' all &s;he does, tends to a contrary Effect. She has naturally a very agreeable Voice and Utterance, which &s;he has chang'd for the prettie&s;t Li&s;p imaginable. She &s;ees what &s;he has a Mind to &s;ee, at half a Mile Di&s;tance; but poring with her Eyes half &s;hut at every one &s;he pa&s;&s;es by, &s;he believes much more becoming. The <HI>Cupid</HI> on her Fan and &s;he have their Eyes full on each other, all the Time in which they are not both in Motion. When|ever her Eye is turned from that dear Object,
<PB N="196" REF="209">
you may have a Glance and your Bow, if &s;he is in Humour, returned as civilly as you make it; but that mu&s;t not be in the Pre&s;ence of a Man of greater Quality: For Mrs. <HI>To&s;s</HI> is &s;o throughly well bred, that the chief Per&s;on pre|&s;ent has all her Regards. And &s;he, who gig|gles at Divine Service, and laughs at her very Mother, can compo&s;e her &s;elf at the Approach of a Man of a good E&s;tate.</P>

<P>A fine Lady &s;hewed a Gentleman of this Com|pany, for an eternal An&s;wer to all his Addre&s;&s;es, a Paper of Ver&s;es, with which &s;he is &s;o capti|vated, that &s;he profe&s;s'd, the Author &s;hould be the happy Man in Spite of all other Pretenders. It is ordinary for Love to make Men Poetical, and it had that Effect on this enamour'd Man: But he was re&s;olved to try his Vein upon &s;ome of her Confidents or Retinue, before he ventured upon &s;o high a Theme as her &s;elf. To do other|wi&s;e than &s;o, would be like making an Heroick Poem a Man's fir&s;t Attempt. Among the Fa|vourites to the Fair One, he found her Parrat not to be in the la&s;t Degree: He &s;aw <HI>Poll</HI> had her Ear, when his Sighs were neglected. To write again&s;t him, had been a fruitle&s;s Labour; therefore he re&s;olved to flatter him into his Inte|re&s;ts, in the following Manner:</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>To a Lady on her Parrat.</HEAD>
<L>When Nymphs were coy, and Love could not prevail,</L>
<L>The Gods di&s;guis'd were &s;eldom known to fail,</L>
<L><HI>Leda</HI> was cha&s;t, but yet a Feather'd <HI>Jove</HI></L>
<L>Surpriz'd the Fair, and taught her how to love.</L>
<L>There's no Cele&s;tial but his Heav'n wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d quit,</L>
<L>For any Form which might to thee admit.</L>
<L>See how the wanton Bird, at every Glance,</L>
<L>Swells his glad Plumes, and feels an am'rous Trunce.</L>
<L>The Queen of Beauty has for&s;ook the Dove,</L>
<L>Henceforth the Parrat be the Bird of Love.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P><PB N="197" REF="210">
It is indeed a very ju&s;t Propo&s;ition, to give that Honour rather to the Parrat than the other Volatile. The Parrat repre&s;ents us in the State of making Love: The Dove in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Object beloved. But in&s;tead of turning the Dove off, I fancy it would be better if the Chai&s;e of <HI>Venus</HI> had hereafter a Parrat added, (as we &s;ee &s;ometimes a Third Hor&s;e to a Coach) which might intimate, That to be a Parrat, is the only Way to &s;ucceed; and to be a Dove, to pre&s;erve your Conque&s;ts. If the Swain would go on &s;ucce&s;sfully, he mu&s;t imitate the Bird he writes upon. For he who would be loved by Women, mu&s;t never be &s;ilent before the Favour, or open his Lips after it.</P>

The true Ca&s;t or Mould in which you may be &s;ure to know him is, when his Livelihood or Edu|cation is in the Civil Li&s;t, and you &s;ee him ex|pre&s;s a Vivacity or Mettle above the Way he is in by a little Jerk in his Motion, &s;hort Trip in his Steps, well-fancied Lining of his Coat, or any other Indications which may be given in a vigorous Dre&s;s. Now, What po&s;&s;ible In&s;inuati|on can there be, that 'tis a Cau&s;e of Quarrel for a Man to &s;ay, he allows a Gentleman really to be, what he, his Taylor, his Ho&s;ier, and his Millener, have con&s;pired to make him? I con|fe&s;s, if this Per&s;on who appeals to me had &s;aid, He was <HI>not a Smart Fellow,</HI> there had been Cau&s;e for Re&s;entment; but if he &s;tands to it that he is one, he leaves no Manner of Ground for a Mi&s;under&s;tanding. Indeed, it is a mo&s;t lamentable Thing, that there &s;hould be a Di&s;pure rai&s;ed upon a Man's &s;aying another is, what he plainly takes Pains to be thought.</P>
<P>But this Point connot be &s;o well adju&s;ted, as by enquiring what are the Sentiments of wi&s;e Nati|ons and Communities of the U&s;e of the Sword, and from thence conclude, Whether it is ho|nourable to draw it &s;o frequently or not? An Illu&s;trious Commonwealth of <HI>Italy</HI> has pre&s;er|ved it &s;elf for many Ages, without letting one of their Subjects handle this de&s;tructive, In&s;tru|ment, always leaving that Work to &s;uch of Mankind as under&s;tand the U&s;e of a whole Skin
<PB N="201" REF="214">
&s;o little, as to make a Profe&s;&s;ion of expo&s;ing it to Cuts and Scars.</P>
<P>But what need we run to &s;uch Foreign In&s;tan|ces: Our mo&s;t ancient and well-governed Cities are con&s;picuous Exemples to all Mankind in their Regulation of Military Atchievements. The chief Citizens, like the noble <HI>Italians,</HI> hire Mer|cenaries to carry Arms in their Stead; and you &s;hall have a Fellow of a de&s;perate Fortune, for the Gain of one Half-Crown, go through all the Dangers of <HI>Tuttle-Fields,</HI> or the <HI>Artillery-Ground,</HI> clap his Right Jaw within Two Inches of the Touch-hole of a Mu&s;quet, fire it off, and Huzza, with as little Concern as he tears a Pullet. Thus you &s;ee, to what Scorn of Danger the&s;e Merce|naries arrive, out of a meer Love of &s;ordid Gain: But methinks it &s;hould take off the &s;trong Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion Men have in Favour of bold Actions, when they &s;ee upon what low Mo|tives Men a&s;pire to 'em. Do but ob&s;erve the common Practice in the Government of tho&s;e Heroick Bodies, our Militia and Lieutenancies, the mo&s;t ancient Corps of Soldiers, perhaps, in the Univer&s;e; I que&s;tion, Whether there is one In&s;tance of an Animo&s;ity between any Two of the&s;e illu&s;trious Sons of <HI>Mars</HI> &s;ince their In&s;titu|tion, which was decided by Combat? I remem|ber indeed to have read the Chronicle, of an Ac|cident which had like to have occa&s;iond Blood|&s;hed in the very Field before all the General Offi|cers, tho' mo&s;t of them were Ju&s;tices of the Peace: Captain <HI>Crabtree</HI> of <HI>Birching-Lane,</HI> Haber|da&s;her, had drawn a Bill upon Major-General <HI>Mag|got,</HI> Chee&s;emonger in <HI>Thames-&s;treet. Crabtree</HI> draws this upon Mr. <HI>William Maggot</HI> and <HI>Compa|ny.</HI> A Country Lad receiv'd this Bill, and not under&s;tanding the Word <HI>Company,</HI> us'd in draw|ing Bills on Men in Partner&s;hip, carried it to Mr. <HI>Jeffrey Stitch</HI> of <HI>Crooked-Lane</HI> (Lieutenant of
<PB N="202" REF="215">
the Major-General's Company) whom he had the Day before &s;een march by the Door in all the Pomp of his Commi&s;&s;ion. The Lieutenant accepts it, for the Honour of the Company, &s;ince it had come to him. But Repayment be|ing ask'd from the Major-General, he ab&s;olute|ly refu&s;es. Upon this, the Lieutenant thinks of nothing le&s;s than to bring this to a Rupture, and takes for his Second, <HI>Tobias Arm&s;trong</HI> of the <HI>Counter,</HI> and &s;ends him with a Challenge in a Scrip of Parchment, wherein was written, <HI>Stitch contra Maggot,</HI> and all the Fury vani&s;h'd in a Moment. The Major-General gives Satisfaction to the Second, and all was well.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that the bold Spirits of our City are kept in &s;uch Subjection to the Civil Power. Otherwi&s;e, Where would our Liberties &s;oon be? If Wealth and Valour were &s;uffer'd to exert them|&s;elves with their utmo&s;t Force: If &s;uch Officers as are employed in the terrible Bands above|mentioned, were to draw Bills as well as Swords: The&s;e dangerous Captains, who could victual an Army as well as lead it, would be too powerful for the State. But the Point of Honour ju&s;tly gives Way to that of Gain; and by long and wi&s;e Regulation, the riche&s;t is the brave&s;t Man. I have known a Captain ri&s;e to a Colonel in Two Days by the Fall of Stocks; and a Major, my good Friend, near the <HI>Monu|ment.</HI> a&s;cended to that Honour by the Fall of the Price of Spirits, and the Ri&s;ing of right <HI>Nantz.</HI> By this true Sen&s;e of Honour, that Bo|dy of Warriors are ever in good Order and Di&s;|cipline, with their Colours and Coats all whole: As in other Battalions (where their Principles of Action are le&s;s &s;olid) you &s;ee the Men of Ser|vice look like Spectres, with long Sides, and lank Cheeks. In this Army, you may mea&s;ure a Man's Services by his Wa&s;te, and the mo&s;t
<PB N="203" REF="216">
prominent Belly is certainly the Man who has been mo&s;t upon Action. Be&s;ides all this, there is another excellent Remark to be made in the Di&s;cipline of the&s;e Troops. It being of ab&s;o|lute Nece&s;&s;ity that the People of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould &s;ee what they have for their Money, and be Eye-witne&s;&s;es of the Advantages they gain by it, all Battles which are fought abroad are re|pre&s;ented here. But &s;ince one Side mu&s;t be beaten, and the other conquer, which might create Di&s;putes, the elde&s;t Company is always to make the other run, and the younger retreats, according to the la&s;t News and be&s;t Intelli|gence. I have my &s;elf &s;een Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> make <HI>Catinat</HI> fly from the Back-&s;ide of <HI>Grays-Inn-Lane</HI> to <HI>Hockley in the Hole,</HI> and not give over the Pur&s;uit, till obliged to leave the <HI>Bear-Gar|den</HI> on the Right, to avoid being borne down by Fencers, Wild Bulls and Mon&s;ters, too terri|ble for the Encounter of any Heroes, but &s;uch who&s;e Lives are their Livelihood.</P>
<P>We have here &s;een, that wi&s;e Nations do not admit of Fighting, even in the Defence of their Country, as a laudable Action; and they live within the Walls of our own City in great Ho|nour and Reputation without it. It would be very nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand, by what Force of the Climate, Food, Education, or Employment, one Man's Sen&s;e is brought to differ &s;o e&s;&s;enti|ally from that of another; that one is ridiculous and contemptible for forbearing a Thing which makes for his Safety; and another applauded for con&s;ulting his Ruin and De&s;truction.</P>
<P>It will therefore be nece&s;&s;ary for us (to &s;how our Travelling) to examine this Subject fully, and tell you how it comes to pa&s;s, That a Man of Honour in <HI>Spain,</HI> tho' you offend him never &s;o gallantly, &s;tabs you ba&s;ely; in <HI>England,</HI> tho' you offend never &s;o ba&s;ely, challenges fairly:
<PB N="204" REF="217">
The former kills you out of Revenge; the latter out of good Breeding. But to probe the Heart of Man in this Particular to its utmo&s;t Thoughts and Rece&s;&s;es, I mu&s;t wait for the Return of <HI>Pa|celet,</HI> who is now attending a Gentleman lately in a Duel, and &s;ometimes vi&s;its the Per&s;on, by who&s;e Hand he received his Wounds.</P>

<P>HAving a very &s;olid Re&s;pect for humane Na|ture, however it is di&s;torted from its na|tural Make, by Affectation, Humour, Cu&s;tom, Misfortune, or Vice, I do apply my &s;elf to my Friends to help me in rai&s;ing Arguments for pre&s;erving it in all its Individuals, as long as it is permitted. To one of my Letters on this Sub|ject, I have received the following An&s;wer:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN An&s;wer to your Que&s;tion, Why Men of Sen&s;e, Virtue and Experience are &s;een &s;till to comply with that ridiculous Cu&s;tom of Duelling? I mu&s;t de&s;ire you to reflect, that Cu&s;tom has di&s;b'd up in Ruffs the wi&s;e&s;t Heads of our Ance&s;tors, and put the be&s;t of the pre&s;ent Age into huge Falbala Pe|riwigs. Men of Sen&s;e would not impo&s;e &s;uch In|cumbrances on them&s;elves; but be glad they might &s;how their Faces decently in Publick upon ea&s;ier Terms. If then &s;uch Men app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ar rea&s;onably Slaves to the Fa&s;hion, in what rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ds the Figure of their Per&s;ons, me ought not to wonder, that they are at lea&s;t &s;o in what &s;eems to touch their Reputations. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ides, you can't be ignorant, that Dre&s;s and Chivalry have been always encouraged by the La|dies, as the Two principal Branches of Gallantry. 'Tis to avoid being &s;neer'd at for his Singularity, and from a De&s;ire to appear more agreeable to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, that a wi&s;e, experienced, and polite Man,
<PB N="207" REF="220">
complices with the Dre&s;s commonly received, and is prevailed upon to violate his Rea&s;on and Prin|ciples, in hazarding his Life and E&s;tate by a Tilt, as well as &s;uffering his Plea&s;ures to be con|&s;trained and &s;owred by the con&s;tant Apprehen&s;ion of a Quarrel. This is the more &s;urpri&s;ing, be|cau&s;e Men of the mo&s;t delicate Sen&s;e and Princi|ples have naturally in other Ca&s;es a particular Repugnance in accommodating them&s;elves to the Maxims of the World: But one may ea&s;ily di|&s;tingui&s;h the Man that is affected with Beauetry, and the Reputation of a Tilt, from him who com|plies with both, meerly as they are impo&s;ed upon him by Cu&s;tom; for in the former you'll remark an Air of Vanity and Triumph; whereas when the latter appears in a long Duvillier full of Powder, or has decided a Quarrel by the Sword, you may perceive in his Face, that he appeals to Cu&s;tom for an Excu&s;e. I think it may not be improper to enquire into the Genealogy of this Chimerical Mon&s;ter, called a <HI>Duel,</HI> which I take to be an illegitimate Species of the ancient Knight-Errantry. By the Laws of this Whim, your He|roick Per&s;on, or Man of Gallantry, was indi&s;pen|&s;ibly obliged to &s;tarve in Armour a certain Num|ber of Years in the Cha&s;e of Mon&s;ters, encounter them at the Peril of his Life, and &s;uffer great Hard&s;hips, in order to gain the Affection of the Fair Lady, and qualifie him&s;elf for a&s;&s;uming the <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lle-Air,</HI> that is, of a Pretty Fellow, or Man of Honour according to the Fa&s;hion: But &s;ince the Publi&s;hing of Don <HI>Quixot,</HI> and Extinction of the Race of Dragons, which <HI>Suetonius</HI> &s;ays happen'd in that of <HI>Wantley,</HI> the gallant and heroick Spi|rits of the&s;e latter Times have been under the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of creating new Chimerical Mon&s;ters to en|tertain them&s;elves with, by Way of &s;ingle Com|bat, as the only Proofs they are able to give their own Sex, and the Ladies, that they are in all
<PB N="208" REF="221">
Poin's Men of nice Honour. But to do Ju&s;tice to the ancient and real Mon&s;ters, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that they never mole&s;ted tho&s;e who were not of a Hu|mour to Hunt for them in the Woods and De&s;arts; whereas on the contrary, our modern Mon&s;ters are &s;o familiarly admitted and entertained in all the Courts and Cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> (except <HI>France</HI>) that one can &s;carce be in the mo&s;t humaniz'd Society without ri&s;quing ones Life; the People of the be&s;t Sort, and the fine Gentlemen of the Age, being &s;o fond of 'em, that they &s;eldom appear in any pub|lick Place without one. I have &s;ome further Con|&s;iderations upon this Subject, which as you encou|rage me, &s;hall be communicated to you, by, Sir, a Cou&s;in; but once removed from the be&s;t Family of the <HI>Staffs,</HI> namely,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>It is certain, Mr. <HI>Switch</HI> has hit upon the true Source of this Evil; and that it proceeds only from the Force of Cu&s;tom that we contradict our &s;elves in half the Particulars and Occurrences of Life. But &s;uch a Tyranny in Love, which the Fair impo&s;e upon us, is a little too &s;evere, that we mu&s;t demon&s;trate our Affection for 'em by no certain Proof but Hatred to one another, or come at them (only as one does to an E&s;tate) by Sur|vivor&s;hip. This Way of Application to gain a Lady's Heart, is taking her as we do Towns and Ca&s;tles, by di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the Place, and letting none come near 'em without our Pa&s;s. Were &s;uch a Lover once to write the Truth of his Heart, and let her know his whole Thoughts, he would appear indeed to have a Pa&s;&s;ion for her; but it would hardly be called Love.

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>June 14.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I am ju&s;t come hither at Ten at Night, and have ever &s;ince Six been in the mo&s;t celebrated, though mo&s;t nau&s;eous, Company in Town: The Two Leaders of the Society were a Critick and a Wit. The&s;e Two Gentlemen are great Opponents upon all Occa&s;ions, not di&s;cerning that they are the neare&s;t each other in Temper and Talents of any Two Cla&s;&s;es of Men in the World; for to profe&s;s Judgment, and to profe&s;s Wit, both ari&s;e from the &s;ame Failure, which is Want of Judgment. The Poverty of the Critick this Way proceeds from the Abu&s;e of his Faculty; that of the Wit, from the Neglect of it. It's a particular Ob&s;ervation I have al|ways made, That of all Morrals, a Critick is the &s;illie&s;t; for by inuring him&s;elf to examine all Things, whether they are of Con&s;equence or not, he never looks upon any Thing but with a De&s;ign of pa&s;&s;ing Sentence upon it; by which Means, he is never a Companion,
<PB N="210" REF="223">
but always a Cen&s;or. This makes him earne&s;t upon Trifles; and di&s;pute on the mo&s;t indiffe|rent Occa&s;ions with Vehemence. If he offers to &s;peak or write, that Talent which &s;hould approve the Work of the other Faculties, pre|vents their Operation. He comes upon Action in Armour; but without Weapons: He &s;tands in Safety; but can gain no Glory. The Wit on the other Hand has been hurried &s;o long away by Imagination only, that Judgment &s;eems not to have ever been one of his natural Faculties. This Gentleman takes him&s;elf to be as much obliged to be merry, as the other to be grave. A thorough Critick is a Sort of Puritan in the polite World. As an Enthu&s;ia&s;t in Religion &s;tumbles at the ordinary Occurrences of Life, if he cannot quote Scripture Examples on the Occa&s;ion; &s;o the Critick is never &s;afe in his Speech or Writing, without he has among the celebrated Writers an Authority for the Truth of his Sentence. You will believe we had a very good Time with the&s;e Brethren, who were &s;o far out of the Dre&s;s of their native Country, and &s;o lo&s;t to its Dialect, that they were as much Strangers to them&s;elves, as to their Relation to each other. They took up the whole Di&s;cour&s;e; &s;ometimes the Critick grew pa&s;&s;ionate, and when reprimanded by the Wit for any Trip or He&s;itation in his Voice, he would an&s;wer, Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> makes &s;uch a Cha|racter on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion break off in the &s;ame Manner; &s;o that the Stop was according to Nature, and as a Man in a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould do. The Wit, who is as far gone in Letters as him&s;elf, &s;eems to be at a Lo&s;s to an&s;wer &s;uch an Apology; and concludes only, that though his Anger is ju&s;tly vented, it wants Fire in the Utterance. If Wit is to be mea&s;ured by the Circum&s;tances of Time and Place, there is no
<PB N="211" REF="224">
Man has generally &s;o little of that Talent, as he who is a Wit by Profe&s;&s;ion. What he &s;ays, in&s;tead of ari&s;ing from the Occa&s;ion, has an Occa&s;ion invented to bring it in. Thus he is new for no other Rea&s;on, but that he talks like no Body el&s;e; but has taken up a Method of his own, without Commerce or Dialogue with other People. The lively <HI>Ja&s;per Dactyle</HI> is one of this Character. He &s;eems to have made a Vow to be witty to his Life's End. When you meet him, What do you think, &s;ays he, I have been entertaining my &s;elf with? Then out comes a premeditated Turn; to which 'tis to no Purpo&s;e to an&s;wer, for he goes on in the &s;ame Strain of Thought he de&s;igned without your &s;peaking. Therefore I have a general An&s;wer to all he can &s;ay; as, <HI>Sure there never was any Creature had &s;o much Fire! Spondee,</HI> who is a Critick, is &s;eldom out of this fine Man's Company. They have no Manner of Affection for each other, but keep together, like <HI>Novell</HI> and <HI>Oldfox</HI> in the <HI>Plain-Dealer,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;how each other. I know &s;everal of Sen&s;e who can be diverted with this Couple; but I &s;ee no Curio&s;ity in the Thing, except it be, that <HI>Spondee</HI> is dull and &s;eems dull; but <HI>Da|ctyle</HI> is heavy with a brisk Face. It mu&s;t be own'd al&s;o, that <HI>Dactyle</HI> has almo&s;t Vigour enough to be a Coxcomb; but <HI>Spondee</HI> by the Lowne&s;s of his Con&s;titution, is only a Block|head.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>June 16.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE Vigilance, the Anxiety, the Tender|ne&s;s, which I have for the good People of <HI>England,</HI> I am per&s;waded will in Time be much commended; but I doubt whether they will ever be rewarded. However, I mu&s;t go on chearfully in my Work of Reformation: That being my great De&s;ign, I am &s;tudious to prevent my Labour's increa&s;ing upon me; therefore am particularly ob&s;ervant of the Temper and Incli|nations of Childhood and Youth, that we may not give Vice and Folly Supplies from the grow|ing Generation. It is hardly to be imagined how u&s;eful this Study is, and what great Evils or Benefits ari&s;e from putting us in our tender Years to what we are fit, or unfit: Therefore on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> la&s;t (with a De&s;ign to &s;ound their Incli|nations) I took Three Lads who are under my Guardian&s;hip, a rambling, in a Hackney-Coach, to &s;how them the Town, as the Lions, the Tombs, <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and the other Places which are Entertainments to raw Minds, becau&s;e they &s;trike forcibly on the Fancy. The Boys are Bro|thers, one of Sixteen, the other of Fourteen, the other of Twelve. The Fir&s;t was his Father's Darling, the Second his Mother's, and the Third is mine, who am their Uncle. Mr. <HI>William</HI> is a Lad of true Genius; but being at the upper End of a great School, and having all the Boys below him, his Arrogance is in&s;upportable. If I begin to &s;how a little of my <HI>Latin,</HI> he imme|diately interrupts: Uncle, under Favour, that which you &s;ay is not under&s;tood in that Manner.
<PB N="215" REF="228">
Brother, &s;ays my Boy <HI>Jack,</HI> You do not &s;how your Manners much in contradicting my Unkle <HI>I&s;aac.</HI> You queer Cur, &s;ays Mr. <HI>William,</HI> Do you think my Uncle takes any Notice of &s;uch a dull Rogue as you are? Mr. <HI>William</HI> goes on; He is the mo&s;t &s;tupid of all my Mother's Chil|dren: He knows nothing of his Book: When he &s;hould mind that, he is hiding or hoard|ing his Taws and Marbles, or laying up Far|things. His Way of Thinking is, Four and twen|ty Farthings make Sixpence, and Two Sixpences a Shilling, Two Shillings and Sixpence Half a Crown, and Two Half-Crowns Five Shillings. So within the&s;e Two Months, the clo&s;e Hunks has &s;crap'd up Twenty Shillings, and we'll make him &s;pend it all before he comes Home. <HI>Jack</HI> immediately claps his Hands into both Pockets, and turns as pale as A&s;hes. There is nothing touches a Parent (and &s;uch I am to <HI>Jack</HI>) &s;o near|ly, as a provident Conduct. This Lad has in him the true Temper for a good Husband, a kind Fa|ther, and an hone&s;t Executor. All the great People you &s;ee make con&s;iderable Figures on the Change, in Court, and &s;ometimes in Senates, are &s;uch as in Reality have no greater Faculty than what may be called Humane In&s;tinct, which is a natural Tendency to their own Pre&s;ervation, and that of their Friends, without being capable of &s;triking out of the Road for Adventures. There's Sir <HI>William Scrip</HI> was of this Sort of Capacity from his Childhood: He has bought the Country round him, and makes a Bargain better than Sir <HI>Harry Wildfire</HI> with all his Wit and Humour. Sir <HI>Harry</HI> never wants Money but he comes to <HI>Scrip,</HI> laughs at him half an Hour, and then gives Bond for t'other Thou|&s;and. The clo&s;e Men are incapable of placing Merit any where but in their Pence, and there|fore gain it; while others, who have larger Ca|pacities.
<PB N="216" REF="229">
are diverted from the Pur&s;uit by Enjoy|ments, which can be &s;upported only by that Ca&s;h which they de&s;pi&s;e; and therefore are in the End, Slaves to their Inferiors both in Fortune and Under&s;tanding. I once heard a Man of ex|cellent Sen&s;e ob&s;erve, That more Affairs in the World failed by being in the Hands of Men of too large Capacities for their Bu&s;ine&s;s, than by being in the Conduct of &s;uch as wanted Abili|ties to execute them. <HI>Jack</HI> therefore being of a plodding Make, &s;hall be a Citizen; and I de|&s;ign him to be the Refuge of the Family in their Di&s;tre&s;s, as well as their Je&s;t in Pro&s;perity. His Brother <HI>Will</HI> &s;hall go to <HI>Oxford</HI> with all Speed, where, if he does not arrive at being a Man of Sen&s;e, he will &s;oon be informed wherein he is a Coxcomb. There is in that Place &s;uch a true Spirit of Raillery and Humour, that if they can't make you a wi&s;e Man, they will certainly let you know you are a Fool, which is all my Cou&s;in wants to cea&s;e to be &s;o. Thus ha|ving taken the&s;e Two out of the Way, I have Lei&s;ure to look at my Third Lad. I ob&s;erve in the young Rogue a natural Subtilty of Mind, which di&s;covers it &s;elf rather in forbearing to declare his Thoughts on any Occa&s;ion, than in any vi&s;ible Way of exerting him&s;elf in Di&s;|cour&s;e. For which Rea&s;on I will place him where, if he commits no Faults, he may go fur|ther than tho&s;e in other Stations, though they excel in Virtues. The Boy is well fa&s;hioned, and will ea&s;ily fall into a graceful Manner; wherefore, I have a De&s;ign to make him a Page to a great Lady of my Acquaintance; by which Means he will be well skill'd in the common Modes of Life, and make a greater Progre&s;s in the World by that Knowledge, than with the greate&s;t Qualities without it. A good Mien in a Court will carry a Man greater Lengths than
<PB N="217" REF="230">
a good Under&s;tanding in any other Place. We &s;ee a World of Pains taken, and the be&s;t Years of Life &s;pent, in collecting a Set of Thoughts in a College for the Conduct of Life; and after all, the Man &s;o qualified &s;hall he&s;itate in his Speech to a good Suit of Clothes, and want common Sen&s;e before an agreeable Woman. Hence it is, that Wi&s;dom, Valour, Ju&s;tice, and Learning, can't keep a Man in Countenance that is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the&s;e Excellencies, if he wants that infe|rior Art of Life and Behaviour, call'd Good Breeding. A Man endow'd with great Perfecti|ons without this, is like one who has his Pockets full of Gold, but always wants Change for his ordinary Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Will. Courtly</HI> is a living In&s;tance of this Truth, and has had the &s;ame Education which I am gi|ving my Nephew. He never &s;poke a Thing but what was &s;aid before, and yet can conver&s;e with the wittie&s;t Men without being ridiculous. Among the Learned, he does not appear igno|rant; nor with the Wi&s;e, indi&s;creet. Living in Conver&s;ation from his Infancy, makes him no where at a Lo&s;s; and a long Familiarity with the Per&s;ons of Men, is in a Manner of the &s;ame Ser|vice to him, as if he knew their Arts. As Cere|mony is the Invention of wi&s;e Men to keep Fools at a Di&s;tance, &s;o good Breeding is an Expedient to make Fools and wi&s;e Men Equals.</P>

<P>The Su&s;pen&s;ion of the Playhou&s;e has made me have nothing to &s;end you from hence; but cal|ling here this Evening, I found the Party I u&s;u|ally &s;it with, upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Writing, and examining what was the hand&s;ome&s;t Style in which to addre&s;s Women, and write Letters of Gallantry. Many were the Opinions which were immediately declared on this Subject: Some were for a certain Softne&s;s; &s;ome for I

know not what Delicacy; others for &s;omething inexpre&s;&s;ibly Tender: When it came to me, I &s;aid there was no Rule in the World to be made for writing Letters, but that of being as near what you &s;peak Face to Face as you can; which is &s;o great a Truth, that I am of Opinion, Wri|ting has lo&s;t more Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es than any one Mi|&s;take in the whole Legend of Love. For when you write to a Lady for whom you have a &s;olid and honourable Pa&s;&s;ion, the great Idea you have of her, join'd to a quick Sen&s;e of her Ab&s;ence, fills your Mind with a Sort of Tenderne&s;s, that gives your Language too much the Air of Complaint, which is &s;eldom &s;ucce&s;sful. For a Man may flat|ter him&s;elf as he plea&s;es, but he will find, that the Women have more Under&s;tanding in their own Affairs than we have, and Women of Spirit are not to be won by Mourners. He that can keep hand&s;omely within Rules, and &s;upport the Car|riage of a Companion to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, is much more likely to prevail, than he who lets her &s;ee, the whole Reli&s;h of his Life depends upon her. If po&s;&s;ible therefore divert your Mi&s;tre&s;s, rather than &s;igh to her. The plea&s;ant Man &s;he will de|&s;ire for her own Sake; but the langui&s;hing Lo|ver has nothing to hope from, but her Pity. To &s;hew the Difference, I produced two Letters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lady gave me, which had been writ by two Gen+tlemen, who pretended to her, but were bot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> kill'd the next Day after the Date at the Batt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of <HI>Almonza.</HI> One of them was a mercurial ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> humour'd Man; the other a Man of a &s;erious, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> a great and gallant Spirit.

<P>IN my Di&s;&s;ertation again&s;t the Cu&s;tom of &s;in|gle Combat, it has been objected, that there is not Learning, or much Reading, &s;hown therein, which is the very Life and Soul of all Treati&s;es; for which Rea&s;on, being always ea&s;y to receive Admonitions, and reform my Errors, I thought fit to con&s;ult this learned

Board on the Subject. Upon propo&s;ing &s;ome Doubts, and de&s;iring their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, a very hopeful young Gentleman, my Relation, who is to be called to the Bar within a Year and an half at farthe&s;t, told me, That he had ever &s;ince I fir&s;t mentioned Duelling turned his Head that Way; and that he was principally moved thereto, becau&s;e he de&s;igned to follow the Cir|cuits in the North of <HI>England</HI> and the South of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to re&s;ide mo&s;tly at his own E&s;tate at <HI>Landbadernawz</HI> in <HI>Cardigan&s;hire.</HI> The Nor|thern <HI>Britains</HI> and the Southern <HI>Scots</HI> are a warm People, and the <HI>Wel&s;h a Nation of Gentlemen;</HI> &s;o that it behov'd him to under&s;tand well the Science of Quarrelling. The young Gentleman proceeded admirably well, and gave the Board an Account, that he had read <HI>Fitzherbert</HI>'s <HI>Grand Abridgment,</HI> and had found, that Duelling is a very ancient Part of the Law: For when a Man is &s;ued, be it for his Life or his Land, the Per&s;on that joins the I&s;&s;ue, whether Plaintiff or Defendant, may put the Trial upon the Duel. Further he argued, under Favour of the Court, that when the I&s;&s;ue is joined by the Duel in Trea&s;on or other Capital Crimes, the Parties accu&s;ed and Accu&s;er mu&s;t fight in their own proper Per&s;ons: But if the Di&s;pute be for Lands, you may hire a Champion at <HI>Hockley in the Hole,</HI> or any where el&s;e. This Part of the Law we had from the <HI>Saxons;</HI> and they had it, as al&s;o the Trial by <HI>Ordeal,</HI> from the <HI>Lapland|ers.</HI> It is indeed agreed, &s;aid he, the Southern and Ea&s;tern Nations never knew any Thing of it; for though the ancient <HI>Romans</HI> would &s;cold, and call Names filthily, yet there is not an Ex|ample of a Challenge that ever pa&s;&s;ed among&s;t them.</P>
<P>His quoting the Ea&s;tern Nations, put another Gentleman in Mind of an Account he had from
<PB N="223" REF="236">
a Boat&s;wain of an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Man; which was, that a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> had tricked and bubbled him, and that when he came to demand Satisfaction the next Morning, and like a true Tar of Honour called him Son of a Whore, Lyar, Dog, and o|ther rough Appellatives u&s;ed by Per&s;ons conver|&s;ant with Winds and Waves; the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> with great Tranquility, de&s;ired him not to come Abroad fa&s;ting, nor put him&s;elf in a Heat, for it would prejudice his Health. Thus the Ea&s;t knows no|thing of this Gallantry.</P>
<P>There &s;ate at the Left of the Table a Per&s;on of a venerable A&s;pect, who a&s;&s;erted, That half the Impo&s;itions which are put upon the&s;e Ages, have been tran&s;mitted by Writers who have given too great Pomp and Magnificence to the Ex|ploits of the ancient <HI>Bear-Garden,</HI> and made their Gladiators, by fabulous Tradition, greater than <HI>Gorman</HI> and others of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> He informed the Company, that he had &s;earched Authorities for what he &s;aid, and that a learned Antiquary, <HI>Humphrey Scarecrow</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Hockley in the Hole,</HI> Recorder to the <HI>Bear-Garden,</HI> was then writing a Di&s;cour&s;e on the Subject. It ap|pears by the be&s;t Accounts, &s;ays this Gentle|man, that the high Names which are u&s;ed among us with &s;o great Veneration, were no other than Stage-fighters, and Worthies of the ancient <HI>Bear-Garden.</HI> The renowned <HI>Hercules</HI> always carried a Quarter&s;taff, and was from thence called <HI>Claviger.</HI> A learned Chronolo|gi&s;t is about proving what Wood this Staff was made of, whether Oak, A&s;h, or Crab-Tree. The fir&s;t Trial of Skill he ever performed, was with one <HI>Cacus,</HI> a Deer-Stealer; the next was with <HI>Typhonus,</HI> a Giant of Forty Foot Four Inches. Indeed it was unhappily recorded, that meeting at la&s;t with a Sailor's Wife, &s;he made his Staff of Prowe&s;s &s;erve her own U&s;e, and dwindle
<PB N="224" REF="237">
away to a Di&s;taff: She clapt him on an old Tar-Jacket of her Husband's; &s;o that this great Hero drooped like a &s;cabbed Sheep. Him his Contemporary <HI>The&s;eus</HI> &s;ucceeded in the <HI>Bear-Garden,</HI> which Honour he held for many Years: This grand Duelli&s;t went to Hell, and was the only One of that Sort that ever came back again. As for <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Hector,</HI> (as the Ballads of tho&s;e Times mention) they were pretty Smart Fellows; they fought at Sword and Buckler; but the former had much the better of it; his Mother, who was an Oy&s;ter-Woman, having got a Black-Smith of <HI>Lemnos</HI> to make her Son's Wea|pons. There's a Pair of tru&s;ty <HI>Trojans</HI> in a Song of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s, that were famous for handling their Gauntlets, <HI>Dares,</HI> and <HI>Entellus;</HI> and indeed it does appear, they fought no Sham Prize. What Arms the great <HI>Alexander</HI> u&s;ed, is uncertain; however, the Hi&s;torian mentions, when he at|tack'd <HI>Thale&s;tris,</HI> it was only at &s;ingle Rapier; but the Weapon &s;oon failed; for it was always ob&s;erved, that the <HI>Amazons</HI> had a Sort of En|chantment about them, which made the Blade of the Weapon, though never of &s;o good Metal, at every home Pu&s;h lo&s;e its Edge and grow fee|ble.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman Bear-Garden</HI> was abundantly more magnificent than any Thing <HI>Greece</HI> could boa&s;t of; it flouri&s;hed mo&s;t under tho&s;e Delights of Man|kind, <HI>Nero</HI> and <HI>Domitian:</HI> At one Time it's re|corded, 400 Senators enter'd the Li&s;t, and thought it an Honour to be cudgelled and quarter&s;taffed. I ob&s;erve, the <HI>Lani&s;tae</HI> were the People chiefly em|ployed, which makes me imagine our <HI>Bear-Gar|den</HI> copied much after this, the Butchers being the greate&s;t Men in it.</P>
<P>Thus far the Glory and Honour of the <HI>Bear-Garden</HI> &s;tood &s;ecure, till Fate, that irre&s;i&s;tible Ruler of &s;ublunary Things, in that univer&s;al

<P>I Know not whether you ought to pity or laugh at me; for I am fallen de&s;perately in Love with a profe&s;s'd <HI>Platonne,</HI> the mo&s;t unaccountable Creature of her Sex. To hear her talk Seraphicks, and run over <HI>Norris</HI> and <HI>Moor,</HI> and <HI>Milton,</HI> and the whole Set of Intel|lectual Triflers, torments me heartily; for to a Lover who under&s;tands Metaphors, all this pretty Prattle of Idea's gives very fine Views of Plea&s;ure, which only the dear Declaimer prevents, by under&s;tanding them literally. Why &s;hould &s;he wi&s;h to be a Cherubim, when 'tis Fle&s;h and Blood that makes her adorable? If I &s;peak to her, that's a high Breach of the Idea of Intuition: If I offer at her Hand or Lip, &s;he &s;hrinks from the Touch like a Sen&s;i|tive Plant, and would contract her &s;elf into meer Spirit. She calls her Chariot, Vehicle; her furbelow'd Scarf, Pinnions: Her blue Mant and Petticoat is her Azure Dre&s;s; and her Footman goes by the Name of <HI>Oberon.</HI> 'Tis my Misfortune to be Six Foot and a half high, Two full Spans between the Shoulders, Thirteen Inches Diameter in the Calves; and before I was in Love, I had a noble Stomach, and u&s;ually went to Bed &s;ober with Two Bot|tles. I am not quite Six and twenty, and my No&s;e is marked truly Aquiline. For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, I am in a very particular Manner her Aver&s;ion. What &s;hall I do? Impudence it &s;elf cannot reclaim her. If I write mi&s;erable, &s;he reckons me among the Children of Perdi|tion, and di&s;cards me her Region: If I a&s;&s;ume the Gro&s;s and Sub&s;tantial, &s;he plays the real Gho&s;t with me, and vani&amp;;shes in a Moment.
<PB N="231" REF="244">
I had Hopes in the Hypocri&s;y of her Sex; but Per&s;everance makes it as bad as fixed Aver&s;ion. I de&s;ire your Opinion, Whether I may not law|fully play the Inqui&s;ition upon her, make u&s;e of a little Force, and put her to the Rack and the Torture, only to convince her, &s;he has real|ly fine Limbs, without &s;poiling or di&s;torting them. I expect your Directions, e're I proceed to dwindle and fall away with De&s;pair; which at pre&s;ent I don't think advi&s;able, becau&s;e, if &s;he &s;hould recant, &s;he may then hate me per|haps in the other Extreme for my Tenuity.

<P>My Patient has put his Ca&s;e with very much Warmth, and repre&s;ented it in &s;o lively a Man|ner, that I &s;ee both his Torment and Tormenter with great Per&s;picuity. This Order of <HI>Platonick</HI> Ladies are to be dealt with in a peculiar Manner from all the re&s;t of the Sex. Flattery is the ge|neral Way, and the Way in this Ca&s;e; but it is not to be done gro&s;ly. Every Man that has Wit, and Humour, and Raillery, can make a good Flatterer for Woman in general; but a <HI>Platoune</HI> is not to be touched with Panegyrick: She will tell you, it is a Sen&s;uality in the Soul to be delight|ed that Way. You are not therefore to com|mend, but &s;ilently con&s;ent to all &s;he does, and &s;ays. You are to con&s;ider in her, the Scorn of you is not Humour, but Opinion.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome Years &s;ince a Set of the&s;e Ladies who were of Quality, and gave out, That Virginity was to be their State of Life during this mortal Condition, and therefore re&s;olved to join their Fortunes, and erect a
<PB N="232" REF="245">
Nunnery. The Place of Re&s;idence was pitched upon; and a pretty Situation, full of natural Falls and Ri&s;ings of Waters, with &s;hady Coverts, and flowry Arbours, was approved by Seven of the Founders. There were as many of our Sex who took the Liberty to vi&s;it tho&s;e Man&s;ions of intended Severity; among others, a famous <HI>Rake</HI> of that Time, who had the grave Way to an Excellence. He came in fir&s;t; but upon &s;eeing a Servant coming towards him, with a De&s;ign to tell him, this was no Place for him or his Companions, up goes my grave Impudence to the Maid: Young Woman, &s;aid he, if any of the Ladies are in the Way on this Side of the Hou&s;e, pray carry us on the other Side towards the Gardens: We are, you mu&s;t know, Gen|tlemen that are travelling <HI>England;</HI> after which we &s;hall go into Foreign Parts, where &s;ome of us have already been. Here he bows in the mo&s;t humble Manner, and ki&s;&s;ed the Girl, who knew not how to behave to &s;uch a Sort of Carriage. He goes on: Now you mu&s;t know we have an Ambition to have it to &s;ay, That we have a Prote&s;tant Nunnery in <HI>England:</HI> But pray Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI>&mdash;Sir, &s;he replied, my Name is <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> at your Service. Then I hear|tily beg your Pardon&mdash;No Offence in the lea&s;t (&s;ays &s;he) for I have a Cou&s;in-German who&s;e Name is <HI>Betty.</HI> Indeed, &s;aid he, I pro|te&s;t to you that was more than I knew, I &s;poke at Random: But &s;ince it happens that I was near in the Right, give me Leave to pre&s;ent this Gentleman to the Favour of a civil Salute. His Friend advances, and &s;o on, till that they had all &s;aluted her. By this Means, the poor Girl was in the middle of the Crowd of the&s;e Fellows at a Lo&s;s what to do, without Cou|rage to pa&s;s through 'em; and the <HI>Platonicks,</HI> at &s;everal Peep-holes, pale, trembling, and fret|ting.
<PB N="233" REF="246">
<HI>Rake</HI> perceiv'd they were ob&s;erv'd, and therefore took Care to keep <HI>Suky</HI> in Chat with Que&s;tions concerning their Way of Life; when appeared at la&s;t <HI>Madonella,</HI> a Lady who had writ a fine Book concerning the Reclu&s;e Life, and was the Projectrix of the Foundation. She approaches into the Hall; and <HI>Rake,</HI> knowing the Dignity of his own Mien and A&s;pect, goes Deputy from his Company. She begins; Sir, I am obliged to follow the Servant, who was &s;ent out to know, What Affair could make Stran|gers pre&s;s upon a Solitude which we, who are to inhabit this Place, have devoted to Hea|ven and our own Thoughts? Madam, replies <HI>Rake,</HI> (with an Air of great Di&s;tance, mixed with a certain Indifference, by which he could di&s;&s;emble Di&s;&s;imulation) your great Intention has made more Noi&s;e in the World than you de&s;ign it &s;hould; and we Travellers, who have &s;een many foreign In&s;titutions of this Kind, have a Curio&s;ity to &s;ee, in its fir&s;t Rudiments, this Seat of Primitive Piety; for &s;uch it mu&s;t be called by future Ages, to the Eternal Honour of the Founders. I have read <HI>Madonella</HI>'s excel|lent and &s;eraphick Di&s;cour&s;e on this Subject. The Lady immediately an&s;wers, If what I have &s;aid could have contributed to rai&s;e any Thoughts in you that may make for the Advancement of intellectual and divine Conver&s;ation, I &s;hould think my &s;elf extremely happy. He immediate|ly fell back with the profounde&s;t Veneration; then advancing, Are you then that admired La|dy? If I may approach Lips which have utter|ed Things &s;o &s;acred&mdash;He &s;alutes her. His Friends followed his Example. The Devoted within &s;tood in Amazement where this would end, to &s;ee <HI>Madonella</HI> receive their Addre&s;s and their Company. But <HI>Rake</HI> goes on&mdash;We
<PB N="234" REF="247">
would not tran&s;gre&s;s Rules; but if we may take the Liberty to &s;ee the Place you have thought fit to chu&s;e for ever, we would go into &s;uch Parts of the Gardens as is con&s;i&s;tent with the Severi|tics you have impo&s;ed on your &s;elves. To be &s;hort, <HI>Madonella</HI> permitted <HI>Rake</HI> to lead her into the A&s;&s;embly of Nuns, followed by his Friends, and each took his Fair One by the Hand, after due Explanation, to walk round the Gardens. The Conver&s;ation turned upon the Lillies, the Flow|ers, the Arbors, and the growing Vegetables; and <HI>Rake</HI> had the &s;olemn Impudence, when the whole Company &s;tood round him, to &s;ay, That he &s;incerely wi&s;hed Men might ri&s;e out of the Earth like Plants; and that our Minds were not of Nece&s;&s;ity to be &s;ullied with carnivorous Appetites for the Generation, as well as Sup|port of our Species. This was &s;poke with &s;o ea&s;ie and fixed an A&s;&s;urance, that <HI>Madonella</HI> an|&s;wer'd, Sir, under the Notion of a pious Thought, you deceive your &s;elf in wi&s;hing an In&s;titution foreign to that of Providence: The&s;e De&s;ires were implanted in us for reverend Purpo&s;es, in pre&s;erving the Race of Men, and giving Oppor|tunities for making our Cha&s;tity more Heroick. The Conference was continued in this Cele&s;tial Strain, and carried on &s;o well by the Managers on both Sides, that it created a Second and a Second Interview; and, without entring into further Particulars, there was hardly one of them but was a Mother or Father that Day Twelve|month.</P>
<P>Any unnatural Part is long taking up, and as long laying a&s;ide; therefore Mr. <HI>Sturdy</HI> may a&s;|&s;ure him&s;elf, <HI>Platonica</HI> will fly for ever from a forward Behaviour; but if he approaches her according to this Model, &s;he will fall in with the Nece&s;&s;ities of mortal Life, and conde&s;cend

My Brother and I have at lea&s;t Fif|ty Times quarrell'd upon this Topick. I ever argue, That the Frailties of Women are to be imputed to the fal&s;e Ornaments which Men of Wit put upon our Folly and Coquetry. He lays all the Vices of Men upon Women's &s;ecret Ap|probation of Libertine Characters in them. I did not care to give up a Point; but now he is out of the Way, I cannot but own I believe there is very much in what he a&s;&s;erted: For if you will believe your Eyes, and own, that the wick|ede&s;t and the wittie&s;t of them all marry one Day or other; Is it po&s;&s;ible to believe, that if a Man thought he &s;hould be for ever incapable of being received by a Woman of Merit and Ho|nour, he would per&s;i&s;t in an abandon'd Way, and deny him&s;elf the Po&s;&s;ibility of enjoying the Happine&s;s of well-govern'd De&s;ires, orderly Sa|tisfactions, and honourable Methods of Life? If our Sex were wi&s;e, a Lover &s;hould have a Cer|tificate from the la&s;t Woman he &s;erved, how he was turned away, before he was received into the Service of another: But at pre&s;ent any Va|gabond is welcome, provided he promi&s;es to enter into our Livery. It is wonderful, that we will not take a Footman without Credentials from his la&s;t Ma&s;ter; and in the greate&s;t Con|cern of Life, we make no Scruple of falling into a Treaty with the mo&s;t notorious Offender in his Behaviour again&s;t others. But this Breach of Commerce between the Sexes, proceeds from an unaccountable Prevalence of Cu&s;tom, by which a Woman is to the la&s;t Degree reproach|able
<PB N="239" REF="252">
for being deceived, and a Man &s;uffers no Lo&s;s of Credit for being a Deceiver.</P>
<P>Since this Tyrant Humour has gained Place, Why are we repre&s;ented in the Writings of Men in ill Figures for Artifice in our Carriage, when we have to do with a profe&s;&s;ed Impo&s;tor? When Oaths, Imprecations, Vows, and Adorations, are made u&s;e of as Words of Cour&s;e, What Arts are not nece&s;&s;ary to defend us from &s;uch as glory in the Breach of 'em? As for my Part, I am re|&s;olved to hear all, and believe none of 'em; and therefore &s;olemnly declare, no Vow &s;hall deceive me, but that of Marriage: For I am turned of Twenty, and being of a &s;mall Fortune, &s;ome Wit. and (if I can believe my Lovers and my Gla&s;s) Hand&s;ome, I have heard all that can be &s;aid towards my Undoing, and &s;hall therefore, for Warning-&s;ake, give an Account of the Of|fers that have been made me, my Manner of re|jecting 'em, and my A&s;&s;i&s;tances to keep my Re|&s;olution.</P>
<P>In the Sixteenth Year of my Life, I fell into the Acquaintance of a Lady extremely well known in this Town for the quick Advancement of her Husband, and the Honours and Di&s;tinctions which her Indu&s;try has procured him, and all who belong to her. This excellent Body &s;ate next to me for &s;ome Months at Church, and took the Liberty (which &s;he &s;aid her Years and the Zeal &s;he had for my Welfare gave her Claim to) to a&s;&s;ure me, that &s;he ob&s;erved &s;ome Parts of my Behaviour which would lead me into Errors, and give Encouragement to &s;ome to entertain Hopes I did not think of. What made you (&s;aid &s;he) look through your Fan at that Lord, when your Eyes &s;hould have been turned upward, or clo&s;ed in Attention upon better Objects? I blu&s;hed, and pretended Fifty odd Excu&s;es;&mdash;but confounded my &s;elf the more. She wanted
<PB N="240" REF="253">
nothing but to &s;ee that Confu&s;ion, and goes on: Nay, Child, do not be troubled that I take No|tice of it, my Value for you made me &s;peak it; for though he is my Kin&s;man, I have a near|er Regard to Virtue than any other Con&s;idera|tion. She had hardly done &s;peaking, when this noble Lord came up to us, and lead her to her Coach.</P>
<P>My Head ran all that Day and Night on the exemplary Carriage of this Woman, who could be &s;o virtuou&s;ly impertinent, as to admoni&s;h one &s;he was hardly acquainted with. However it &s;truck upon the Vanity of a Girl that it may po&s;&s;ibly be, his Thoughts might have been as favourable of me, as mine were amorous of him, and as unlikely Things as that have hap|pened, if he &s;hould make me his Wife. She never mentioned this more to me; but I &s;till in all publick Places &s;tole Looks at this Man, who ea&s;ily ob&s;erved my Pa&s;&s;ion for him. It is &s;o hard a Thing to check the Return of a|greeable Thoughts, that he became my Dream, my Vi&s;ion, my Food, my Wi&s;h, my Tor|ment.</P>
<P>That Mini&s;ter of Darkne&s;s, the Lady <HI>Semphro|nia,</HI> perceived too well the Temper I was in, and would one Day after Evening Service needs take me to the Park. When we were there, my Lord pa&s;&s;es by; I flu&s;hed into a Flame. Mrs. <HI>Di|&s;taff,</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) You may very well remember the Concern I was in upon the fir&s;t Notice I took of your Regard to that Lord, and for|give me, who had a tender Friend&s;hip for your Mother (now in her Grave) that I am vigi|lant of your Conduct. She went on with much Severity, and after great Solicitation, prevailed on me to go with her into the Country, and there &s;pend the en&s;uing Summer out of the Way of a Man &s;he &s;aw I loved, and one whom
<PB N="241" REF="254">
&s;he perceived meditated my Ruin, by frequent|ly de&s;iring her to introduce him to me; which &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, except he would give his Honour that he had no other De&s;ign but to marry me. To her Country-Hou&s;e a Week or Two after we went: There was at the far|ther End of her Garden a Kind of Wilderne&s;s, in the Middle of which ran a &s;oft Rivu|let by an Arbour of Je&s;&s;amin. In this Place I u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ed my retired Hours, and read &s;ome Romantick or Poetical Tale till the Clo&s;e of the Evening. It was near that Time in the Heat of Summer, when gentle Winds, &s;oft Murmurs of Water, and Notes of Nightingals had given my Mind an Indolence, which ad|ded to that Repo&s;e of Soul, Twilight and the End of a warm Day naturally throws up|on the Spirits. It was at &s;uch an Hour, and in &s;uch a State of Tranquility I &s;at, when, to my unexpre&s;&s;ible Amazement, I &s;aw my Lord walking towards me, whom I knew not till that Moment to have been in the Country. I could ob&s;erve in his Approach the Perplexity which attends a Man big with De&s;ign; and I had, while he was coming forward, Time to reflect that I was betrayed; the Sen&s;e of which gave me a Re&s;entment &s;uitable to &s;uch a Ba&s;e|ne&s;s: But when he entered into the Bower where I was, my Heart flew towards him, and, I confe&s;s, a certain Joy came into my Mind, with an Hope, that he might then make a Declaration of Honour and Pa&s;&s;ion. This threw my Eye upon him with &s;uch Tender|ne&s;s, as gave him Power, with a broken Ac|cent, to begin. Madam,&mdash;You will won|der&mdash;For it is certain, you mu&s;t have ob|&s;erved&mdash;though I fear you will mi&s;inter|pret the Motives&mdash;But by Heaven, and all that's Sacred! If you could&mdash;Here he
<PB N="242" REF="255">
made a full Stand. And I recovered Power to &s;ay, The Con&s;ternation I am in you will not, I hope, believe&mdash;An helple&s;s innocent Maid&mdash;Be&s;ides that, the Place&mdash;He &s;aw me in as great Confu&s;ion as him&s;elf; which attributing to the &s;ame Cau&s;es, he had the Audaciou&s;ne&s;s to throw him&s;elf at my Feet, talk of the Stilne&s;s of the Evening, and then ran into Deifications of my Per&s;on. Pure Flames, Con&s;tant Love, Eter|nal Raptures, and a Thou&s;and other Phra&s;es drawn from the Images we have of Heaven, which ill Men u&s;e for the Service of Hell, were run over with uncommon Vehemence. After which, he &s;eized me in his Arms: His De&s;ign was too evident. In my utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s, I fell upon my Knees&mdash;My Lord, pity me, on my Knees&mdash;On my Knees in the Cau&s;e of Virtue, as you were lately in that of Wickedne&s;s. Can you think of de&s;troying the Labour of a whole Life, the Purpo&s;e of a long Education, for the ba&s;e Service of a &s;udden Appetite; to throw one that loves you, that doats on you, out of the Com|pany and Road of all that is virtuous and Prai&s;e|worthy? Have I taken in all the In&s;tructions of Piety, Religion and Rea&s;on, for no other End, but to be the Sacrifice of Lu&s;t, and abandoned to Scorn? A&s;&s;ume your &s;elf, my Lord, and do not attempt to vitiate a Temple Sacred to Inno|cence, Honour, and Religion. If I have inju|red you, &s;tab this Bo&s;om, and let me die, but not be ruined by the Hand I love. The Ardency of my Pa&s;&s;ion made me incapable of uttering more; and I &s;aw my Lover a&s;toni&s;hed and re|formed by my Behaviour: When ru&s;hed in <HI>Sem|phronia.</HI> Ha! Faithful ba&s;e Man, could you then &s;teal out of Town, and lurk like a Robber about my Hou&s;e for &s;uch bruti&s;h Purpo&s;es!</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="256">
My Lord was by this Time recovered, and fell into a violent Laughter at the Turn which <HI>Sem|phronia</HI> de&s;igned to give her Villany. He bowed to me with the utmo&s;t Re&s;pect: Mrs. <HI>Di&s;taff,</HI> &s;aid he, be careful hereafter of your Company; and &s;o retired. The Friend <HI>Semphronia</HI> congra|tulated my Deliverance with a Flood of Tears.</P>
<P>This Nobleman has &s;ince very frequently made his Addre&s;&s;es to me with Honour, but I have as often refu&s;ed them; as well knowing, that Fa|miliarity and Marriage will make him, on &s;ome ill-natured Occa&s;ion, call all I &s;aid in the Arbour a Theatrical Action. Be&s;ides that, I glory in con|temning a Man, who had Thoughts to my Di&s;|honour. If this Method were the Imitation of the whole Sex, Innocence would be the only Dre&s;s of Beauty; and all Affectation by any other Arts to plea&s;e the Eyes of Men, would be bani&s;hed to the Stews for ever. The Conque&s;t of Pa&s;&s;ion gives Ten times more Happine&s;s than we can reap from the Gratification of it; and &s;he that has got over &s;uch a one as mine, will &s;tand among Beaux and Pretty Fellows, with as much Safety as in a Summer's Day among Gra&s;s-hoppers and Butterflies.</P>

<P>HAving taken upon me to cure all the Di|&s;tempers which proceed from Affections of the Mind, I have laboured, &s;ince I fir&s;t kept this publick Stage, to do all the Good I could, and have perfected many Cures at my own Lodg|ings; carefully avoiding the common Method of Mountebanks, to do their mo&s;t eminent Opera|tions
<PB N="245" REF="258">
in Sight of the People; but mu&s;t be &s;o ju&s;t to my Patients as to declare, they have te&s;tified under their Hands their Sen&s;e of my poor Abili|ties, and the Good I have done them, which I publi&s;h for the Benefit of the World, and not out of any Thoughts of private Advantage.</P>
<P>I have cured fine Mrs. <HI>Spy</HI> of a great Im|perfection in her Eyes, which made her eter|nally rolling them from one Coxcomb to ano|ther in publick Places, in &s;o langui&s;hing a Man|ner, that it at once le&s;&s;ened her own Power, and her Beholders Vanity. Twenty Drops of my Ink, placed in certain Letters on which &s;he attentively looked for half an Hour, have re|&s;tored her to the true U&s;e of her Sight; which is, to guide, and not mi&s;lead us. Ever &s;ince &s;he took this Liquor, which I call, <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI>'s <HI>Circum&s;pection-Water,</HI> &s;he looks right forward, and can bear being looked at for half a Day without returning one Glance. This Water has a peculiar Vertue in it, which makes it the only true Co&s;metick or Beauty-Wa&s;h in the World: The Nature of it is &s;uch, that if you go to a Gla&s;s, with a De&s;ign to admire your Face, it im|mediately changes it into downright Deformity. If you con&s;ult it only to look with a better Countenance upon your Friends, it immediately gives an Alacrity to the Vi&s;age, and new Grace to the whole Per&s;on. There is indeed a great deal owing to the Con&s;titution of the Per&s;on to whom it is applied: It is in vain to give it when the Patient is in the Rage of the Di&s;temper; a Bride in her fir&s;t Month, a Lady &s;oon after her Husband's being Knighted, or any Per&s;on of either Sex who has lately obtained any new good Fortune or Preferment, mu&s;t be prepared &s;ome Time before they u&s;e it. It has an Ef|fect upon others, as well as the Patient, when it is taken in due Form. Lady <HI>Petulant</HI> has by
<PB N="246" REF="259">
the U&s;e of it cured her Husband of Jealou&s;y, and Lady <HI>Gad</HI> her whole Neighbourhood of Detra|ction.</P>
<P>The Fame of the&s;e Things, added to my being an old Fellow, makes me extreamly acceptable to the Fair Sex. You would hardly believe me, when I tell you there is not a Man in Town &s;o much their Delight as my &s;elf. They make no more of vi&s;iting me, than going to Madam <HI>d'Epingle</HI>'s. There were two of them, namely, <HI>Damia</HI> and <HI>Clidamira,</HI> (I a&s;&s;ure you Women of Di&s;tinction) who came to &s;ee me this Morning in their Way to Prayers, and being in a very diverting Humour, (as Innocence always makes People chea ful) they would needs have me, according to the Di&s;tinction of <HI>pretty</HI> and <HI>very</HI> pretty Fellows, inform them, if I thought either of them had a Title to the <HI>very Pretty</HI> a|mong tho&s;e of their own Sex; and if I did, which was the more de&s;erving of the Two?</P>
<P>To put them to the Tryal, Look ye, &s;aid I, I mu&s;t not ra&s;hly give my Judgment in Matters or this Importance; pray let me &s;ee you dance: I play upon the Kit. They immediately fell back to the lower End of the Room (You may be &s;ure they curt'&s;y'd low enough to me): And began. Never were Two in the World &s;o equally match|ed, and both S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ars to my Name&s;ake <HI>I&s;aac.</HI> Never was Man in &s;o dange ous a Condition as my &s;e f, when they began to expand their Charms. Oh! Ladies, Ladies, cried I, not half that Air, you'll fire the Hou&s;e. Both &s;miled; for by the by, there's no carrying a Metaphor too far, when a Lady's Charms are &s;poke of. Some Body, I think, has called a fine Woman dancing, a Brandi&s;hed Torch of Beauty. The&s;e Rivals moved with &s;uch an agreeable Freedom, that you would believe their Ge&s;ture was the nece&s;|&s;ary Effect of the Mu&s;ick, and not the Product of Skill and Practice. Now <HI>Clidamira</HI> came on
<PB N="247" REF="260">
with a Crowd of Graces, and demanded my Judg|ment with &s;o &s;weet an Air&mdash;And &s;he had no &s;ooner carried it, but <HI>Damia</HI> made her utterly forgot by a gentle &s;inking, and a Rigadoon Step. The Conte&s;t held a full half Hour; and I pro|te&s;t, I &s;aw no manner of Difference in their Per|fections, till they came up together, and expected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Sentence. Look ye Ladies, &s;aid I, I &s;ee no Preference in the lea&s;t in your Performance; but you <HI>Clidamira</HI> &s;eem to be &s;o well &s;atisfied that I &s;hall determine for you, that I mu&s;t give it to <HI>Damia,</HI> who &s;tands with &s;o much Diffidence and Fear, after &s;howing an equal Merit to what &s;he pretends to. Therefore, <HI>Clidamira,</HI> you are a <HI>pretty;</HI> but, <HI>Damia,</HI> you are a <HI>very</HI> pretty Lady. For, &s;aid I, Beauty lo&s;es its Force, if not accom|panied with Mode&s;ty. She that has an humble Opinion of her &s;elf, will have every Body's Ap|plau&s;e, becau&s;e &s;he does not expect it; while the vain Creature lo&s;es Approbation through too great a Sen&s;e of de&s;erving it.</P>

<P>Being of a very &s;pare and hective Con&s;titu|tion, I am forced to make frequent Journies of a Mile or Two for fre&s;h Air; and indeed by this la&s;t, which was no further than the Village of <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> I am further convinced of the Nece&s;&s;ity of travelling to know the World. For as it is u&s;ual with young Voyagers, a&s;&s;oon as they land upon a Shore, to begin their Accounts of the Nature of the People, their Soil, their Go|vernment, their Inclinations, and their Pa&s;&s;ions; &s;o really I fancied I could give you an immedi|ate De&s;cription of this Village, from the Five Fields where the Robbers lie in wait, to the Coffee-hou&s;e where the <HI>Literari</HI> &s;it in Council. A great Ance&s;tor of ours by the Mother's Side, Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Overdo,</HI> (who&s;e Hi&s;tory is
<PB N="248" REF="261">
written by <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI>) met with more Enor|mities by walking <HI>incog.</HI> than he was capable of correcting; and found great Mortifications in ob&s;erving al&s;o Per&s;ons of Eminence, whom he before knew nothing of. Thus it fared with me, even in a Place &s;o near the Town as this. When I came into the Coffee-hou&s;e, I had not Time to &s;alute the Company, before my Eye was diverted by Ten Thou&s;and Gimcracks round the Room and on the Sieling. When my fir&s;t A&s;toni&s;hment was over, comes to me a Sage of a thin and meagre Countenance; which A&s;pect made me doubt, whether Read|ing or Fretting had made it &s;o Philo&s;ophick: But I very &s;oon perceived him to be of that Sect which the Ancients call <HI>Gingivi&s;tae;</HI> in our Language, Tooth-Drawers. I immediately had a Re&s;pect for the Man; for the&s;e practical Phi|lo&s;ophers go upon a very rational Hypothe&s;is, not to cure, but take away the Part affected. My Love of Mankind made me very benevo|lent to Mr. <HI>Salter,</HI> for &s;uch is the Name of this eminent Barber and Antiquary. Men are u&s;ual|ly, but unju&s;tly, di&s;tingui&s;hed rather by their Fortunes, than their Talents, otherwi&s;e this Per|&s;onage would make a great Figure in that Cla&s;s of Men which I di&s;tingui&s;h under the Title of <HI>Odd Fellows.</HI> But it is the Misfortune of Per|&s;ons of great Genius, to have their Faculties di&s;&s;ipated by Attention to too many Things at once. Mr. <HI>Salter</HI> is an In&s;tance of this: If he would wholly give him&s;elf up to the String, in&s;tead of playing Twenty Beginnings to Tunes, he might before he dies play <HI>Roger de Caubly</HI> quite out. I heard him go through his whole Round, and indeed I think he does play the merry <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> Bells pretty ju&s;tly; but he confe&s;s'd to me, he did that rather to &s;how he was Orthodox, than that he valued him&s;elf up|on
<PB N="249" REF="262">
the Mu&s;ick it &s;elf. Or if he did proceed in his Anatomy, Why might not he hope in Time to cut off Legs, as well as draw Teeth? The Particularity of this Man put me into a deep Thought, whence it &s;hould proceed, that of all the lower Order, Barbers &s;hould go further in hitting the Ridicul us, than any other Set of Men. Watermen brawl, Coblers &s;ing: But why mu&s;t a Barber be for ever a Po|litician, a Mu&s;ician, an Anatomi&s;t, a Poet, and a Phy&s;ician? The learned <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius</HI> &s;ays, his Bar|ber u&s;ed to comb his Head in <HI>Iambicks.</HI> And indeed in all Ages, one of this u&s;eful Profe&s;&s;ion, this Order of Co&s;metick Philo&s;ophers, has been celebrated by the mo&s;t eminent Hands. You &s;ee the Barber in Don <HI>Quixot</HI> is one of the princi|pal Characters in the Hi&s;tory, which gave me Satisfaction in the Doubt, why Don <HI>Saltero</HI> writ his Name with a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Termination: For he is de&s;cended in a right Line, not from <HI>John Tra|de&s;can,</HI> as he him&s;elf a&s;&s;erts, but from that me|morable Companion of the Knight of <HI>Mancha.</HI> And I hereby certify all the worthy Citizens who travel to &s;ee his Rarities, that his double|barrelled Pi&s;tols, Targets, Coats of Mail, his Sclopeta, and Sword of <HI>Toledo,</HI> were left to his Ance&s;tor by the &s;aid Don <HI>Quixot,</HI> and by the &s;aid Ance&s;tor to all his Progeny down to Don <HI>Saltero.</HI> Though I go thus far in favour of Don <HI>Saltero</HI>'s great Merit, I cannot allow a Liberty he takes of impo&s;ing &s;everal Names (without my Licence) on the Collections he has made, to the Abu&s;e of the good People of <HI>England;</HI> one of which is particularly calculated to de|ceive Religious Per&s;ons, to the great Scandal of the Well-di&s;po&s;ed, and may introduce Hetero|dox Opinions. He &s;hows you a Straw-Hat, which I know to be made by <HI>Madge Peskad,</HI> within Three Miles of <HI>Bedford;</HI> and tells you.
<PB N="250" REF="263">
<HI>it is</HI> Pontius Pilate<HI>'s Wife's Chambermaid's Si&s;ter's Hat.</HI> To my knowledge of this very Hat, it may be added, that the Covering of Straw was ne|ver u&s;ed among the <HI>Jews,</HI> &s;ince it was deman|ded of them to make Bricks without it. There|fore this is really nothing, but under the &s;peci|ous Pretence of Learning and Antiquity, to im|po&s;e upon the World. There are other Things which I cannot tolerate among his Rarities; as, the <HI>China</HI> Figure of a Lady in the Gla&s;s-Ca&s;e; the <HI>Italian</HI> Engine for the Impri&s;onment of tho&s;e who go Abroad with it: Both which I hereby order to be taken down, or el&s;e he may expect to have his Letters Patents for making Punch &s;uper&s;eded, be debarred wearing his Muff next Winter, or ever coming to <HI>London</HI> without his Wife. It may perhaps be thought I have dwelt too long upon the Affairs of this Operator; but I de&s;ire the Reader to remember, that it is my Way to con&s;ider Men as they &s;tand in Merit, and not according to their Fortune or Figure; and if he is in a Coffee-hou&s;e at the Reading hereof, let him look round, and he will find there may be more Characters drawn in this Account than that of Don <HI>Saltero;</HI> for half the Politicians about him, he may ob&s;erve, are, by their Place in Nature, of the Cla&s;s of Tooth-Drawers.</P>

<P>THere is an Habit or Cu&s;tom which I have put my Patience to the utmo&s;t Stretch to have &s;uffered &s;o long, becau&s;e &s;everal of my in|timate Friends are in the Guilt; and that is, the Humour of taking Snuff, and looking dirty a|bout the Mouth by Way of Ornament.</P>
<P>My Method is to dive to the Bottom of a Sore before I pretend to apply a Remedy. For this Rea&s;on, I &s;at by an eminent Story-teller and Poli|tician who takes half an Ounce in five Seconds, and has mortgaged a pretty Tenement near the Town, meerly to improve and dung his Brains with this prolifick Powder. I ob&s;erved this Gentleman t'other Day in the mid&s;t of a Story diverted from it by looking at &s;omething at a Di&s;tance, and I &s;oftly hid his Box. But he re|turns to his Tale, and looking for his Box, he cries, <HI>And &s;o Sir</HI>&mdash;Then when he &s;hould have taken a Pinch; <HI>As I was &s;aying,</HI> &s;ays he&mdash;<HI>Has no Body &s;een my Box?</HI> His Friend be&s;eeches him to fini&s;h his Narration. Then he proceeds; <HI>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Sir&mdash;Where can my Box be?</HI> Then turn|ing to me; <HI>Pray Sir, Did you &s;ee my Box?</HI> Yes Sir, &s;aid I, I took it to &s;ee how long you could live without it. He re&s;umes his Tale; and I took Notice, that his Dulne&s;s was much more regular and fluent than before. A Pinch &s;up|plied the Place of, <HI>As I was &s;aying, And &s;o Sir;</HI> and he went on currently enough in that Style
<PB N="252" REF="265">
which the Learned call the In&s;ipid. This Ob&s;er|vation ea&s;ily led me into a Philo&s;ophick Rea&s;on for taking Snuff, which is done only to &s;upply with Sen&s;ations the Want of Reflection. This I take to be an <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>a no&s;trum;</HI> upon which I hope to receive the Thanks of this Board. For as it is natural to lift a Man's Hand to a Sore, when you fear any Thing coming at you; &s;o when a Per&s;on feels his Thoughts are run out, and has no more to &s;ay, it is as natural to &s;upply his weak Brain with Powder at the neare&s;t Place of Acce&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> the No&s;trils. This is &s;o evident, that Nature &s;ugge&s;ts the U&s;e according to the Indigence of the Per&s;ons who u&s;e this Medicine, without being prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Force of Fa|&s;hion or Cu&s;tom. For Example; the Native <HI>Hi|bernians,</HI> who are reckoned not much unlike the ancie t <HI>Baeotians,</HI> take this Specifick for Empti|ne&s;s in the Head, in greater Abundance than any other Nation under the Sun. The learned <HI>Sotus,</HI> as &s;paring as he is in his Words, would be &s;till more &s;ilent if it were not for this Powder.</P>
<P>However low and poor, the taking Snuff ar|gues a Man to be in his own Stock of Thought, or Means to employ his Brains and his Fingers, yet there is a poorer Creature in the World than He, and this is a Borrower of Snuff; a Fellow that keeps no Box of his own, but is always ask|ing others for a Pinch. Such poor Rogues put me always in Mind of a common Phra&s;e among School-Boys when they are compo&s;ing their Ex|erci&s;e, who run to an upper Scholar, and cry, <HI>Pray give me a little</HI> Sen&s;e. But of all Things, com|mend me to the Ladies who are got into this pretty Help to Di&s;cour&s;e. I have been this Three Years per&s;wading <HI>Sagi&s;&s;a</HI> to leave it off; but &s;he talks &s;o much, and is &s;o Learned, that &s;he is above Con|tradiction. However, an Accident t'other Day brought that about, which my Eloquence never
<PB N="253" REF="266">
could accompli&s;h: She had a <HI>very pretty Fellow</HI> in her Clo&s;et, who ran thither to avoid &s;ome Company that came to vi&s;it her. She made an Excu&s;e to go in to him for &s;ome Implement they were talking of. Her eager Gallant &s;natched a Ki&s;s; but being unu&s;ed to Snuff, &s;ome Grains from off her upper Lip made him &s;neeze aloud, which alarm'd the Vi&s;itants, and has made a Di&s;|covery, that profound Reading, very much In|telligence, and a general Knowledge of who and who's together, cannot fill up her vacant Hours &s;o much, but that &s;he is &s;ometimes obliged to de&s;cend to Entertainments le&s;s intellectual.</P>

<P>Having taken a Re&s;olution when Plays are acted next Winter by an entire good Company, to publi&s;h Ob&s;ervations from Time to Time on the Performance of the Actors, I think it but ju&s;t to give an Ab&s;tract of the Laws of Action, for the Help of the le&s;s learned Part of the Audience,

that they may rationally enjoy &s;o refined and in|&s;tructive a Plea&s;ure as a ju&s;t Repre&s;entation of humane Life. The great Errors in Playing are admirably well expo&s;ed in <HI>Hamlet</HI>'s Direction to the Actors who are to play in his &s;uppo&s;ed Tra|gedy; by which we &s;hall form our future Judg|ments on their Behaviour, and for that Rea&s;on you have the Di&s;cour&s;e as follows:</P>
<Q>Speak the Speech as I pronounce it to you, trippingly on the Tongue; but if you mouth it as many of our Players do, I had as lieu the Town-Cryer had &s;poke my Lines: Nor do not &s;aw the Air too much with your Hand thus; but u&s;e all gently: For in the very Torrent, Tempe&s;t, and, as I may &s;ay, the Whirlwind of Pa&s;&s;ion, you mu&s;t acquire and beget a Tem|perance that may give it Smoothne&s;s. Oh! It offends me to the Soul, to &s;ee a robu&s;tous Periwig-pated Fellow tear a Pa&s;&s;ion to Tatters, to very Rags, to &s;plit the Ears of the Ground|lings, who (for the mo&s;t Part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb Shews and Noi&s;e.

Now this over|done, or come tardy off, though it make the Unskilful laugh, cannot but make the Judici|ous grieve. The Cen&s;ures of which one mu&s;t, in your Allowance, over&s;way a whole Theatre

Oh! there be Players that I have &s;een play, and heard others prai&s;e, and that highly, (not to &s;peak it prophanely) that nei|ther having the Accent of <HI>Chri&s;tian, Pagan,</HI> or <HI>Norman,</HI> have &s;o &s;trutted and bellowed, that I have thought &s;ome of Nature's Journey men had made Men, and not made them well, they imitated Humanity &s;o abominably.

<P>IT is now almo&s;t Three Weeks &s;ince what you writ about happen'd in this Place: The Quarrel between my Friends did not run &s;o high as I find your Accounts have made it. The Truth of the Fact you &s;hall have very faithfully. You are to under&s;tand, that the Per&s;ons concern'd in this Scene were, Lady <HI>Autumn,</HI> and Lady <HI>Springly: Autumn</HI> is a Per|&s;on of good Breeding, Formality, and a &s;in|gular Way practi&s;ed in the la&s;t Age; and Lady <HI>Springly,</HI> a modern Impertinent of our Sex, who affects as improper a Familiarity, as the other does Di&s;tance. Lady <HI>Autumn</HI> knows to an Hair's Breadth where her Place is in all A&s;|&s;emblies and Conver&s;ations; but <HI>Springly</HI> nei|ther gives nor takes Place of any Body, but under&s;tands the Place to &s;ignify no more, than to have Room enough to be at Ea&s;e wherever &s;he comes. Thus while <HI>Autumn</HI> takes the Whole of this Life to con&s;i&s;t in un|der&s;tanding Punctilio and Decorum, <HI>Springly</HI> takes every Thing to be becoming which con|tributes
<PB N="260" REF="273">
to her Ea&s;e and Satisfaction. The&s;e Heroines have married Two Brothers, both Knights. <HI>Springly</HI> is the Spou&s;e of the elder, who is a Baronet; and <HI>Autumn,</HI> being a rich Widow, has taken the younger, and her Pur&s;e endowed him with an equal Fortune and Knighthood of the &s;ame Order. This Jum|ble of Titles, you need not doubt, has been an aching Torment to <HI>Autumn,</HI> who took Place of the other on no Pretence, but her Carele&s;|ne&s;s and Di&s;regard of Di&s;tinction. The &s;ecret Occa&s;ion of Envy broiled long in the Brea&s;t of <HI>Autumn;</HI> but no Opportunity of Contention on that Subject happening, kept all Things quiet till the Accident, of which you demand an Account.</P>
<P>It was given out among all the gay People of this Place, That on the 9th In&s;tant &s;everal Dam&s;els, &s;wift of Foot, were to run for a Sute of Head-Clothes at the <HI>Old Wells.</HI> Lady <HI>Autumn</HI> on this Occa&s;ion invited <HI>Springly</HI> to go with her in her Coach to &s;ee the Race. When they came to the Place where the <HI>Go|vernour of Ep&s;om</HI> and all his Court of Citizens were a&s;&s;embled, as well as a Crowd of Peo|ple of all Orders, a brisk young Fellow ad|dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the younger of the La|dies, <HI>viz. Springly,</HI> and offers her his Service to conduct her into the Mu&s;ick-Room. <HI>Spring|ly</HI> accepts the Compliment, and is led trium|phantly through a bowing Crowd, while <HI>Au|tumn</HI> is left among the Rabble, and has much ado to get back into her Coach; but &s;he did it at la&s;t: And as it is u&s;ual to &s;ee by the Hor|&s;es my Lady's pre&s;ent Di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he orders <HI>John</HI> to whip furiou&s;ly Home to her Husband; where, when &s;he enters, down &s;he &s;its, be|gan to unpin her Hood, and lament her fool|i&s;h fond Heart to marry into a Family where
<PB N="261" REF="274">
&s;he was &s;o little regarded, &s;he that might&mdash;Here &s;he &s;tops; then ri&s;es up and &s;tamps, and &s;its down again. Her gentle Knight made his Approaches with a &s;upple be&s;eeching Ge|&s;ture. My Dear, &s;aid he,&mdash;Tell me no Dears, replied <HI>Autumn</HI>&mdash;in the Pre&s;ence of the Go|vernour and all the Merchants&mdash;What will the World &s;ay of a Woman that has thrown her &s;elf away at this Rate? Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> withdrew, and knew it would not be long a Secret to him; as well as that Experience told him, He that marries a Fortune, is of Cour&s;e guilty of all Faults again&s;t his Wife, let them be com|mitted by whom they will. But <HI>Springly,</HI> an Hour or Two after, returns from the <HI>Wells,</HI> and finds the whole Company together. Down &s;he &s;at, and a profound Silence en&s;ued. You know a premeditated Quarrel u&s;ually begins and works up with the Words, <HI>Some People.</HI> The Silence was broken by Lady <HI>Autumn,</HI> who began to &s;ay, <HI>There are Some People who fancy, that if Some People&mdash;Springly</HI> imme|diately takes her up; <HI>There are Some People who fancy, if Other People&mdash;Autumn</HI> repar|tees; <HI>People may give them&s;elves Airs; but Other People, perhaps, who make le&s;s ado, may be, perhaps, as agreeable as People who &s;et them&s;elves out more.</HI> All the other People at the Table &s;at mute, while the&s;e Two People, who were quarrelling, went on with the U&s;e of the Word <HI>People,</HI> in&s;tancing the very Ac|cidents between them, as if they kept only in di&s;tant Hints. <HI>Therefore,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Autumn,</HI> red|ning, <HI>There are &s;ome People will go Abroad in other People's Coaches, and leave tho&s;e with whom they went to &s;hift for them&s;elves; and if, perhaps, tho&s;e People have married the youn|ger Brother; yet, perhaps, he may be behol|den to tho&s;e People for what he is.

The Wives immediately fell upon their Husbands, and tore Periwigs and Cravats. The Company interpo|&s;ed; when (according to the Slip-Knot of Ma|trimony, which makes them return to one ano|ther when any put in between) the Ladies and their Husbands fell upon all the re&s;t of the Company; and having beat all their Friends and Relations out of the Hou&s;e, came to them|&s;elves time enough to know, there was no bear|ing the Je&s;t of the Place after the&s;e Adventures, and therefore marched off the next Day. It is &s;aid, the Governour has &s;ent &s;everal Joints of Mutton, and has propo&s;ed divers Di&s;hes very exqui&s;itely dre&s;&s;ed, to bring them down again.

<P>This Day appear'd here a Figure of a Per&s;on, who&s;e Services to the Fair Sex have reduced him to a Kind of Exi&s;tence, for which there is no Name. If there be a Condition between Life and Death, without being ab&s;olutely dead or living, his State is that. His A&s;pect and Complexion in his robu&s;t Days gave him the il|lu&s;trious Title of <HI>Africanus:</HI> But it is not only from the warm Climates in which he has &s;er|ved, nor from the Di&s;a&s;ters in which he has &s;uf|fered, that he de&s;erves the &s;ame Appellation with that renowned <HI>Roman;</HI> but the Magnanimity with which he appears in his la&s;t Moments, is what gives him the undoubted Character of <HI>Hero. Cato</HI> &s;tabbed him&s;elf, and <HI>Hannibal</HI> drank Poi|&s;on; but our <HI>Africanus</HI> lives in the continual Puncture of aching Bones and poi&s;oned Juices. The Old Heroes fled from Torments by Death, and this Modern lives in Death and Torments, with an Heart wholly bent upon a Supply for remaining in them. An ordinary Spirit would &s;ink under his Oppre&s;&s;ions; but he makes an Advantage of his very Sorrow, and rai&s;es an Income from his Di&s;ea&s;es. Long has this Wor|thy been conver&s;ant in Bartering, and knows that when Stocks are lowe&s;t, it is the Time to buy. Therefore, with much Prudence and Tranquility, he thinks, that now he has not a Bone &s;ound, but a Thou&s;and nodous Parts for which the Anatomi&s;t have not Words, and more Di&s;ea&s;es than the College ever heard of, it is the only Times to purcha&s;e an Annuity for Life. Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> told me, it was an Entertain|ment more &s;urprizing and plea&s;ant than can be imagined, to &s;ee an Inhabitant of neither World without Hand to lift, or Leg to move, &s;carce Tongue to utter his Meaning, &s;o keen upon

biting the whole World, and making Bubbles at his Exit. Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> added, that he would have bought Twelve Shillings a Year of him, but that he feared there was &s;ome Trick in it, and belie|ved him already dead: What! Says that Knight, Is Mr. <HI>Partridge,</HI> whom I met ju&s;t now going on both his Legs firmer than I can, allowed to be quire dead; and &s;hall <HI>Africanus,</HI> without one Limb that can do its Office, be pronounced alive.</P>
<P>What heightened the Tragi-Comedy of this Market for Annuities was, that the Ob|&s;ervation of it provoked <HI>Monocalus</HI> (who is the mo&s;t Eloquent of all Men) to many excel|lent Reflections, which he &s;poke with the Vehemence and Language both of a Game|&s;ter and an Orator. <Q REND="inline">"When I ca&s;t (&s;aid that delightful Speaker) my Eye upon thee, thou unaccountable <HI>Africanus,</HI> I cannot but call my &s;elf as unaccountable as thou art; for cer|tainly we were born to &s;hew what Contra|dictions Nature is plea&s;ed to form in the &s;ame Species. Here am I, able to eat, to drink, to &s;leep, and do all Acts of Nature, except begetting my Like; and yet by an unintelligible Force of Spleen and Fancy, I every Moment imagine I am dying. It is utter Madne&s;s in thee to provide for Supper; for I'll bet you Ten to One, you don't live till half an Hour after Four; and yet I am &s;o di&s;tracted as to be in Fear every Moment, though I'll lay Ten to Three, I drink Three Pints of burnt Claret at your Funeral Three Nights hence. After all, I envy thee; thou that ha&s;t no Sen&s;e of Death, art happier than one that always fears it."</Q> The Knight had gone on, but that a Third Man ended the Seene by applauding the Knight's Eloquence

<P>IT may be thought very unaccountable, that I who can never be &s;uppo&s;ed to go to <HI>White</HI>'s, &s;hould pretend to talk to you of Matters proper for, or in the Stile of, that Place. But though I never vi&s;it the&s;e publick Haunts, I conver&s;e with tho&s;e that do; and for all they pretend &s;o much to the contrary, they are as talkative as our Sex, and as much at a Lo&s;s to entertain the pre&s;ent Company, without &s;acrificing the la&s;t, as we our &s;elves. This Reflection has led me into the Con|&s;ideration of the U&s;e of Speech; and made me look over in my Memory all my Acquaintance of both Sexes, to know to which I may more ju&s;tly impute the Sin of &s;uperfluous Di&s;cour&s;e, in Re|gard to Conver&s;ation, without entring into it as it re&s;pects Religion.</P>
<P>I fore&s;ee my Acquaintance will immediately, upon &s;tarting this Subject, ask me, How I &s;hall celebrate Mrs. <HI>Al&s;e Cop&s;wood,</HI> the <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Hun|tre&s;s, who is come to Town lately, and moves as if &s;he were on her Nag, and going to take a Five-Bar Gate; and is as loud as if &s;he were fol|lowing her Dogs? I can ea&s;ily an&s;wer that; for &s;he is as &s;oft as <HI>Damon,</HI> in Compari&s;on of her Brother-in-Law <HI>Tom. Bellfrey,</HI> who is the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Man in this Kingdom for all Gen|tleman-like Activities and Accompli&s;hments. It is allow'd, that he is a profe&s;s'd Enemy to the
<PB N="267" REF="280">
<HI>Italian</HI> Performers in Mu&s;ick. But then for our own native Manner, according to the Cu&s;toms and known U&s;ages of our I&s;land, he is to be pre|ferr'd, for the Generality of the Plea&s;ure he be|&s;tows, much before tho&s;e Fellows, though they &s;ing to full Theatres. For what is a Theatrical Voice to that of a Fox-hunter? I have been at a Mu&s;ical Entertainment in an open Field, where it amaz'd me to hear to what Pitches the chief Ma&s;ters would reach. There was a Meeting near our Seat in <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> and the mo&s;t emine t of all the Counties of <HI>England</HI> were at it. How wonderful was the Harmony between Men and Dogs! <HI>Robin Cartail</HI> of <HI>Bucks</HI> was to an&s;wer to <HI>Jowler;</HI> Mr. <HI>Tinbrea&s;t</HI> of <HI>Cornwal</HI> was appointed to open with <HI>Sweetlips,</HI> and Beaux <HI>Slimber,</HI> a <HI>Lon|doner,</HI> undertook to keep up with <HI>Trips,</HI> a Whelp ju&s;t &s;et in: <HI>Tom. Bellfrey</HI> and <HI>Ringwood</HI> were cou|pled together, to fill the Cry on all Occa&s;ions, and be in at the Death of the Fox, Hare, or Stag; for which both the Dog and the Man were excel|lently &s;uited, and loved one another, and were as much together as <HI>Bani&s;ter</HI> and <HI>King.</HI> When <HI>Jowler</HI> fir&s;t alarm'd the Field, <HI>Cartail</HI> repeated every Note; <HI>Sweetlips</HI>'s Treble &s;ucceeded, and &s;hook the Wood; <HI>Tinbrea&s;t</HI> eccho'd a Quarter of a Mile beyond it. We were &s;oon after all at a Lo&s;s, till we rid up, and found <HI>Trips</HI> and <HI>Slimber</HI> at a Default in Half Notes: But the Day and the Tune was recovered by <HI>Tom. Bellfrey</HI> and <HI>Ring|wood,</HI> to the great Joy of us all, tho' they drown|ed every other Voice: For <HI>Bellfrey</HI> carries a Note Four Furlongs, Three Rood, and Six Paces, fur|ther than any other in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I fear the Mention of this will be thought a Digre&s;&s;ion from my Purpo&s;e about Speech: But I an&s;wer, No. Since this is u&s;ed where Speech rather &s;hould be employ'd, it may come in o Con&s;ideration in the &s;ame Chapter: For Mr. <HI>Bell|frey</HI>
<PB N="268" REF="281">
being at a Vi&s;it where I was, <HI>viz.</HI> his Cou|&s;in's (Lady <HI>Dainty</HI>'s) in <HI>Soho,</HI> was asked, What Entertainments they had in the Country? Now <HI>Bellfrey</HI> is very ignorant, and much a Clown; but confident withal. In a Word, he &s;truck up a Fox-Cha&s;e: Lady <HI>Dainty</HI>'s Dog, Mr. <HI>Sippet,</HI> as &s;he calls him, &s;tarted and jump'd out of his La|dy's Lap, and fell a barking. <HI>Bellfrey</HI> went on, and call'd all the neighbouring Pari&s;hes into the Square. Never was Woman in &s;uch Confu&s;ion as that delicate Lady. But there was no &s;top|ping her Kin&s;man. A Room full of Ladies fell into the mo&s;t violent Laughter: My Lady look'd as if &s;he was &s;hrieking; Mr. <HI>Sippet</HI> in the Mid|dle of the Room, breaking his Heart with bark|ing, but all of us unheard. As &s;oon as <HI>Bell|frey</HI> became &s;ilent, up gets my Lady, and takes him by the Arm to lead him off: <HI>Bellfrey</HI> was in his Boots. As &s;he was hurrying him away, his Spurs takes hold of her Petticoat; his Whip throws down a Cabinet of <HI>China:</HI> He cries, <HI>What! Are your Crocks rotten? Are your Petti|coats ragged? A Man can't walk in your Hou&s;e for Trincums.</HI></P>
<P>Every County of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has One Hun|dred or more of this Sort of Fellows, who Roar in&s;tead of Speaking. Therefore if it be true, that we Women are al&s;o given to greater Flu|ency of Words than is nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ure &s;he that di&s;turbs but a Room or a Family is more to be to|lerated, than one who draws together Pari&s;hes and Counties, and &s;ometimes (with an E&s;tate that might make him the Ble&s;&s;ing and Ornament of the World around him) has no other View and Ambition, but to be an Animal above Dogs and Hor&s;es, without the Reli&s;h of any one En|joyment, which is peculiar to the Faculties of hu|mane Nature. I know it will here be &s;aid, that talking of meer Country Squires at this Rate, is,
<PB N="269" REF="282">
as it were, to write again&s;t <HI>Valentine</HI> and <HI>Or&s;on.</HI> To prove any Thing again&s;t the Race of Men, you mu&s;t take 'em as they are adorn'd with Edu|cation, as they live in Courts, or have received In&s;tructions in Colleges.</P>
<P>But I am &s;o full of my late Entertainment by Mr. <HI>Bellfrey,</HI> that I mu&s;t defer pur&s;uing this Sub|ject to another Day; and wave the proper Ob&s;er|vations upon the different Offenders in this Kind, &s;ome by profound Eloquence on &s;mall Occa|&s;ions, others by degrading Speech upon great Circum&s;tances. Expect therefore to hear of the Whi&s;perer without Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Laugher with|out Wit, the Complainer without receiving In|juries, and a very large Crowd, which I &s;hall not fore&s;tall, who are common (though not com|monly ob&s;erv'd) Impertinents, who&s;e Tongues are too voluble for their Brains, and are the ge|neral De&s;pi&s;ers of us Women, though we have their Superiors, the Men of Sen&s;e, for our Ser|vants.</P>

<P>THE End of all publick Papers ought to be the Benefit and In&s;truction, as well as the Diver&s;ion of the Readers: To which I &s;ee none &s;o truly conducive as your late Perfor|mances; e&s;pecially tho&s;e tending to the root|ing out from among&s;t us that Unchri&s;tian-like and Bloody Cu&s;tom of Duelling; which, that you have already in &s;ome Mea&s;ure perform'd, will appear to the Publick in the following no le&s;s True than Heroick Story.</P>
<P>A Noble Gentleman of this City, who has the Honour of &s;erving his Country as Major in the Train-Bands, being at that General Mart of Stock-Jobbers call'd <HI>Jonathans,</HI> endeavour|ing to rai&s;e him&s;elf (as all Men of Honour ought) to the Degree of Colonel at lea&s;t; it happened that he bought the <HI>Bear</HI> of another Officer, who, though not Commi&s;&s;ioned in the Army, yet no le&s;s eminently &s;erves the Pub|lick than the other, in rai&s;ing the Credit of the Kingdom, by rai&s;ing that of the Stocks. However, having &s;old the <HI>Bear,</HI> and Words ari&s;ing about the Delivery, the mo&s;t Noble Major, no le&s;s &s;corning to be outwitted in the Coffee-hou&s;e, than to run into the Field, according to Method, abu&s;ed the other with the Titles of, <HI>Rogue, Villain, Bearskin-Man,</HI> and the like. Whereupon Satisfaction was demanded, and accepted: So, forth the Major march'd, commanding his Adver&s;ary to fol|low. To a mo&s;t &s;pacious Room in the She|riff's Hou&s;e, near the Place of Quarrel, they come; where, having due Regard to what you have lately publi&s;h'd, they re&s;olved not to &s;hed one another's Blood in that barba|rous Manner you prohibited; yet, not wil|ling
<PB N="272" REF="285">
to put up Affronts without Satisfaction' they &s;tripp'd, and in decent Manner fought full fairly with their wrathful Hands. The Combat la&s;ted a Quarter of an Hour; in which Time Victory was often doubtful, and many a dry Blow was &s;trenuou&s;ly laid on by each Side, till the Major finding his Adver|&s;ary ob&s;tinate, unwilling to give him further Cha&s;ti&s;ement, with mo&s;t &s;hrill Voice cry'd out, <HI>I am &s;atisfied, enough.</HI> Whereupon the Com|bat ceas'd, and both were Friends imme|diately.</P>
<P>Thus the World may &s;ee, how nece&s;&s;ary it is to encourage tho&s;e Men, who make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to in&s;truct the People in every Thing nece&s;&s;ary for their Pre&s;ervation. I am in|formed, a Body of worthy Citizens have a|greed on an Addre&s;s of Thanks to you for what you have writ on the foregoing Subject, whereby they acknowledge one of their highly e&s;teem'd Officers pre&s;erv'd from Death.</P>

<P>I fear the Word <HI>Bear</HI> is hardly to be under|&s;tood among the polite People; but I take the Meaning to be, That one who en&s;ures a Real Value upon an Imaginary Thing, is &s;aid to &s;ell a <HI>Bear,</HI> and is the &s;ame Thing as a Promi&s;e a|mong Courtiers, or a Vow between Lovers.

<P>In Pur&s;uance of my la&s;t Date from hence, I am to proceed on the Accounts I promi&s;ed of &s;everal Per&s;onages among the Men, who&s;e con|&s;picuous Fortunes, or Ambition in &s;hewing their Follies, have exalted them above their Fellows: The Levity of their Minds is vi&s;ible in their every Word and Ge&s;ture, and there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s not a Day pa&s;&s;es but puts me in Mind of Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s Character of a Coxcomb <HI>He is ugly all over with the Affectation of the fine Gentleman.</HI> Now though the Women may put on Softne&s;s in their
<PB N="274" REF="287">
Looks, or affected Severity, or impertinent Gaie|ty, or pert Smartne&s;s, their Self-Love and Admi|ration cannot, under any of the&s;e Di&s;gui&s;es, ap|pear &s;o invincible as that of the Men. You may ea&s;ily take Notice, that in all their Actions there is a &s;ecret Approbation, either in the Tone of their Voice, the Turn of their Body, or Ca&s;t of their Eye, which &s;hows that they are extremely in their own Favour.</P>
<P>Take one of your Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;hall keep you half an Hour with your Hat off, enter|taining you with his Con&s;ideration of that Af|fair you &s;poke of to him la&s;t, till he has drawn a Crowd that ob&s;erves you in this Grimace. Then when he is publick enough, he immediately runs into Secrets, and falls a whi&s;pering. You and he make Breaks with Adverbs; as, <HI>But however, thus far;</HI> and then you whi&s;per again, and &s;o on, till they who are about you are di&s;per&s;ed, and your bu&s;y Man's Vanity is no longer gratified by the Notice taken of what Importance he is, and how incon&s;iderable you are; for your Pretender to Bu&s;ine&s;s is never in Secret, but in Publick.</P>
<P>There is my dear Lord <HI>No-where,</HI> of all Men the mo&s;t gracious and mo&s;t obliging, the Terror of all Valets de Chambre, whom he oppre&s;&s;es with good Breeding, in enquiring for my good Lord, and for my good Lady's Health. This imi|table Courtier will whi&s;per a Privy-Coun&s;ellor's Lacquey with the utmo&s;t Goodne&s;s and Conde|&s;cention, to know when they next &s;it; and is throughly taken up, and thinks he has a Part in a Secret, if he knows that there is a Secret. <HI>What it is</HI> he will whi&s;per you, <HI>that Time will di&s;cover;</HI> then he &s;hrugs, and calls you back a|gain&mdash;<HI>Sir, I need not &s;ay to you. That the&s;e Things are not to be &s;poken of&mdash;And hark'ee, No Names, I would not be quoted.</HI> What adds to the Je&s;t is, that his Emptine&s;s has its Moods and Sea&s;ons,
<PB N="275" REF="288">
and he will not conde&s;cend to let you into the&s;e his Di&s;coveries, except he is in very good Hu|mour, or has &s;een &s;ome Body in Fa&s;hion talk to you. He will keep his <HI>Nothing</HI> to him&s;elf, and pa&s;s by and overlook as well as the be&s;t of 'em; not ob&s;erving that he is in&s;olent when he is gra|cious, and obliging when he is haughty. Show me a Woman &s;o incon&s;iderable as this frequent Character.</P>
<P>But my Mind (now I am in) turns to many no le&s;s ob&s;ervable: Thou dear <HI>Will. Shoe&s;tring!</HI> I profe&s;s my &s;elf in Love with thee? How &s;hall I &s;peak thee? How &s;hall I addre&s;s thee? How &s;hall I draw thee? Thou dear Out&s;ide! Will you be combing your Wig, Playing with your Box, or Picking your Teeth?

Rub 'em no longer, dear <HI>Shoe&s;tring:</HI> Do not premeditate Mur|der: Do not for ever Whiten: Oh! That for my Quiet and his own they were rotten.</P>
<P>But I will forget him, and give my Hand to the courteous <HI>Umbra;</HI> He is a fine Man indeed, but the &s;oft Creature bows below my Apron-String before he takes it; yet after the fir&s;t Ce|remonies, he is as familiar as my Phy&s;ician, and his In&s;ignificancy makes me half ready to com|plain to him of all I would to my Doctor. He is &s;o courteous, that he carries half the Me&s;&s;ages of Ladies Ails in Town to their Midwives and Nur&s;es. He under&s;tands too the Art of Medi|cine as far as to the Cure of a Pimple or a Ra&s;h. On Occa&s;ions of the like Importance, he is the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous of all Men living, in con&s;ulting and &s;earching Precedents from Family to Fami|ly; then he &s;peaks of his Ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s and Diligence in the Style of real Services.

<P>The Approaches before <HI>Tournay</HI> have been car|ried on with great Succe&s;s; and our Advices from the Camp before that Place of the 11th In&s;tant &s;ay, That they had already made a Lodgment on the Glacis. Two Hundred Boats were come up the <HI>Scheld</HI> with the heavy Artillery and Ammu|nition, which would be employed in di&s;mount|ing the Enemy's Defences, and rais'd on the Bat|teries the 15th. A great Body of Miners are &s;um|moned to the Camp to countermine the Works of the Enemy. We are convinced of the Weakne&s;s of the Garri&s;on, by a certain Account, That they call'd a Council of War, to con&s;ult whether it was not advi&s;able to march into the Citadel, and leave the Town defencele&s;s. We are a&s;&s;ured, That when the Confederate Army was advan|cing towards the Camp of Mar&s;hal <HI>Villars,</HI> that General di&s;patch'd a Courier to his Ma&s;ter with a Letter, giving an Account of their Approach, which concluded with the following Words: <HI>The Day begins to break, and your Maje&s;ty's Army is already in Order of Battle.

<P>AS I am call'd forth by the immen&s;e Love I bear to my Fellow Creatures, and the warm Inclination I feel within me, to &s;tem, as far I can, the prevailing Torrent of Vice and Ignorance; &s;o I cannot more properly pur&s;ue that noble Impul&s;e, than by &s;etting forth the Excellence of Virtue and Knowledge in their native and beautiful Colours. For this Rea&s;on I made my late Excur&s;ion to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where tho&s;e Qualities appear in their highe&s;t Lu&s;tre, and are the only Pretences to Honour and Di|&s;tinction. Superiority is there given in Propor|tion to Men's Advancement in Wi&s;dom and Learning; and that ju&s;t Rule of Life is &s;o uni|ver&s;ally received among tho&s;e happy People, that you &s;hall &s;ee an Earl walk bear-headed to the Son of the meane&s;t Artificer, in Re&s;pect to &s;even Years more Worth and Knowledge than the Nobleman is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of. In other Places they bow to Men's Fortunes, but here to their Under&s;tandings. It is not to be expre&s;s'd, how plea&s;ing the Order, the Di&s;cipline, the Regula|rity of their Lives, is to a Philo&s;opher, who has, by many Years Experience in the World, learn'd to contemn every Thing but what is re|ver'd in this Man&s;ion of &s;elect and well-taught Spirits. The Magnificence of their Palaces, the Greatne&s;s of their Revenues, the Sweetne&s;s of their Groves and Retirements, &s;eem equally a|dapted
<PB N="279" REF="292">
for the Re&s;idence of Princes and Philo&s;o|phers; and a Familiarity with Objects of Splen|dour, as well as Places of Rece&s;s, prepares the Inhabitants with an Equanimity for their future Fortunes, whether humble or illu&s;trious. How was I pleas'd when I look'd round at St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, and could, in the Faces of the ingenious Youth, &s;ee Mini&s;ters of State, Chan&s;ellors, Bi&s;hops, and Judges. Here only is Humane Life! Here only the Life of Man is a Rational Being! Here Men under&s;tand and are employed in Works worthy their noble Nature. This tran&s;itory Being pa&s;&s;es away in an Employment not unworthy a future State, the Contemplation of the great Decrees of Providence. Each Man lives as if he were to an&s;wer the Que&s;tions made to <HI>Job, Where wa&s;t thou when I laid the Foundations of the Earth? Who &s;hut up the Sea with Doors, and &s;aid, Hither|to &s;halt thou come, and no further?</HI> Such Specu|lations make Life agreeable, make Death wel|come.</P>
<P>But alas! I was torn from this noble Society by the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this dirty mean World, and the Cares of Fortune: For I was oblig'd to be in <HI>London</HI> again&s;t the 7th Day of the Term, and accordingly govern'd my &s;elf by my <HI>Oxford</HI> Al|manack, and came la&s;t Night; but find, to my great A&s;toni&s;hment, that this ignorant Town began the Term on the 24th of the la&s;t Month, in Oppo&s;ition to all the Learning and A&s;tronomy of the famous Univer&s;ity of which I have been &s;peaking; according to which, the Term cer|tainly was to commence on the 1&s;t In&s;tant. You may be &s;ure, a Man who has turn'd his Studies as I have, could not be mi&s;taken in Point of Time; for knowing I was come to Town in Term, I examin'd the pa&s;&s;ing Moments very narrowly, and called an eminent A&s;tronomer to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance. Upon very &s;trict Ob&s;ervation
<PB N="280" REF="293">
we &s;ound, that the Cold has been &s;o &s;evere this la&s;t Winter, (which is allow'd to have a benum|ming Quality) that it retarded the Earth in mo|ving round from <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> to this Sea&s;on full Seven Days and Two Seconds. My Learned Friend a&s;&s;ured me further, That the Earth had lately received a Shog from a Comet that cro&s;s'd its Vortex, which, if it had come Ten Degrees nearer us, had made us lo&s;e this whole Term. I was indeed once of Opinion, That the <HI>Grego|rian</HI> Computation was the mo&s;t regular, as be|ing Eleven Days before the <HI>Julian;</HI> but am now fully convinc'd, that we ought to be Seven Days after the Chancellor and Judges, and Eighteen before the Pope of <HI>Rome;</HI> and that the <HI>Oxonion</HI> Computation is the be&s;t of the Three.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Rea&s;ons which I have gather'd from Philo&s;ophy and Nature; to which I can add other Circum&s;tances in Vindication of the Account of this Learned Body who publi&s;h'd this Almanack.</P>
<P>It is notorious to Philo&s;ophers, that Joy and Grief can ha&s;ten and delay Time. Mr. <HI>Lock</HI> is of Opinion, That a Man in great Mi&s;ery may &s;o far lo&s;e his Mea&s;ures, as to think a Minute an Hour; or in Joy, make an Hour a Minute. Let us examine the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e by this Rule, and we &s;hall find, that the Cau&s;e of this general Mi|&s;take in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, has been the great Succe&s;s of the la&s;t Campaigne, and the follow|ing Hopes of Peace. Stocks ran &s;o high at the <HI>Change,</HI> that the Citizens had gain'd Three Days of the Courtiers; and we have indeed been &s;o happy this Reign, that it the Univer&s;ity did not rectify our Mi&s;takes, we &s;hould think our &s;elves but in the Second Year of Her pretent Maje&s;ty. It would be endle&s;s to enumerate the many Da|mages that have happened by this Ignorance of

the Vulgar. All the Recognizances within the Dioce&s;e of <HI>Oxford</HI> have been forfeited, for not appearing on the Fir&s;t Day of this Fictitious Term. The Univer&s;ity has been Non&s;uited in their Action again&s;t the Book&s;ellers for printing <HI>Clarendon</HI> in <HI>Quarto.</HI> Indeed what gives me the mo&s;t quick Concern, is the Ca&s;e of a poor Gentleman my Friend, who was t'other Day taken in Execution by a Set of ignorant Bai|liffs. He &s;hould, it &s;eems, have pleaded in the fir&s;t Week of Term; but being a Ma&s;ter of Arts of <HI>Oxford,</HI> he would not recede from the <HI>Oxonian</HI> Computation. He &s;hew'd Mr. <HI>Broad</HI> the <HI>Almanack,</HI> and the very Day when the Term began; but the mercile&s;s ignorant Fel|low, again&s;t all Sen&s;e and Learning, would hur|ry him away. He went indeed quietly enough; but he has taken exact Notes of the Time of Arre&s;t, and &s;ufficient Witne&s;&s;es of his being car|ried into Gaol; and has, by Advice of the Recorder of <HI>Oxford,</HI> brought his Action; and we doubt not but we &s;hall pay 'em off with Da|mages, and blemi&s;h the Reputation of Mr. <HI>Broad.</HI> We have one convincing Proof, which all that frequent the Courts of Ju&s;tices are Witne&s;&s;es of: The Dog that comes con&s;tantly to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> on the Fir&s;t Day of the Term, did not appear till the Fir&s;t Day according to the <HI>Oxford Al|manack;</HI> who&s;e In&s;tinct I take to be a better Guide than Men's erroneous Opinions, which are u&s;ually bya&s;s'd by Intere&s;t.

<P>The Subject of Duels has, I find, been &s;tarted with &s;o good Succe&s;s, that it has been the fre|quent Subject of Conver&s;ation among polite Men; and a Dialogue of that Kind has been tran&s;mit|ted to me <HI>verbatim,</HI> as follows. The Per&s;ons concern'd in it are Men of Honour, and Expe|rience in the Manners of Men, and have fallen upon the true&s;t Foundation, as well as &s;earch'd the Bottom of this Evil.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Sage.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If it were in my Power, every Man that drew his Sword, unle&s;s in the Service, or purely to defend his Life, Per&s;on, or Goods, from Violence, (I mean ab&s;tracted from all Puncto's or Whims of Honour) &s;hould ride the Wooden Hor&s;e in the <HI>Tilt-Yard</HI> for &s;uch Fir&s;t Offence, for the Second &s;tand in the Pillory, and for the Third be Pri&s;oner in <HI>Bedlam</HI> for Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel <HI>Plume.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I remember, that a Rencoun|ter or Duel was &s;o far from being in Fa&s;hion a|mong the Officers that &s;erv'd in the Parliament Army, that on the contrary, it was as di&s;repu|table, and as great an Impediment to Advance|ment in the Service, as being ba&s;hful in Time of Action.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Mark.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yet I have been inform'd by &s;ome old Cavaliers, of famous Reputation for brave and gallant Men, that they were much more in Mode among their Party, than they have been during this la&s;t War.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Plume.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That is true too Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="283" REF="298">
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Sage.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>By what you &s;ay, Gentlemen, one &s;hould think that our pre&s;ent Military Officers are compounded of an equal Proportion of both tho&s;e Tempers; &s;ince Duels are neither quite di&s;countenanc'd, nor much in vogue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Mark.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That Difference of Temper, in Re|gard to Duels, which appears to have been be|tween the Court and Parliament-Men of the Sword, was not (I conceive) for Want of Cou|rage in the latter, nor of a liberal Education, becau&s;e there were &s;ome of the be&s;t Families in <HI>England</HI> engag'd in that Party; but Gallantry and Mode, which glitter agreeably to the Imagi|nation, were encouraged by the Court, as pro|moting its Splendour; and it was as natural that the contrary Party (who were to recommend them&s;elves to the Publick for Men of &s;erious and &s;olid Parts) &s;hould deviate from every Thing Chimerical.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Sage.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have never read of a Duel among the <HI>Romans;</HI> and yet their Nobility u&s;ed more Liberty with their Tongues than one may do now without being challeng'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Mark.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps the <HI>Romans</HI> were of Opi|nion, that ill Language, and brutal Manners, re|flected only on tho&s;e who were guilty of them; and that a Man's Reputation was not at all clear'd by cutting the Per&s;on's Throat who had reflected upon it: But the Cu&s;tom of tho&s;e Times had fixed the Scandal in the Action; whereas now it lies in the Reproach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Sage.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And yet the only Sort of Duel that one can conceive to have been fought upon Mo|tives truly honourable and allowable, was that between the <HI>Horatii</HI> and <HI>Curiatii.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Mark.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Colonel <HI>Plume,</HI> Pray what was the Method of Single Combat in your Time among the Cavaliers? I &s;uppo&s;e, that as the U&s;e of Clothes continues, though the Fa&s;hion of them
<PB N="284" REF="299">
has been mutable; &s;o Duels, tho' &s;till in U&s;e, have had in all Times their particular Modes of Performance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Plume.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We had no con&s;tant Rule, but generally conducted our Di&s;pute and Tilt accord|ing to the la&s;t that had happen'd between Per|&s;ons of Reputation among the very Top Fellows for Bravery and Gallantry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Mark.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If the Fa&s;hion of Quarrelling and Tilting was &s;o often chang'd in your Time, Colonel <HI>Plume,</HI> a Man might fight, yet lo&s;e his Credit for want of under&s;tanding the Fa|&s;hion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Plume.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir <HI>Mark,</HI> in the Beginning of <HI>July,</HI> a Man would have been cen&s;ur'd for want of Courage, or been thought indigent of the true Notions of Honour, if he had put up Words; which in the End of <HI>September</HI> follow|ing, one could not re&s;ent without pa&s;&s;ing for a brutal and quarrel&s;ome Fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Mark.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But Colonel, Were Duels or Ren|counters mo&s;t in Fa&s;hion in tho&s;e Days?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Plume.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your Men of nice Honour, Sir, were for avoiding all Cen&s;ure of Advan|tage which they &s;uppos'd might be taken in a Rencounter; therefore they us'd Seconds, who were to &s;ee that all was upon the Square, and make a faithful Report of the whole Combat; but in a little Time it became a Fa&s;hion for the Seconds to fight, and I'll tell you how it hap|pened.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Sage.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do, Colonel <HI>Plume,</HI> and the Method of a Duel at that Time, and give us &s;ome Notion of the Puncto's upon which your nice Men quarrelled in tho&s;e Days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Plume.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I was going to tell you, Mr. <HI>Sage,</HI> That one Cornet <HI>Modi&s;h</HI> had de&s;ned his Friend, Captain <HI>Smart,</HI>'s Opinion in &s;ome Affair, but did not follow it; upon which Captain <HI>Smart</HI> &s;ent
<PB N="285" REF="300">
Major <HI>Adroit</HI> (a very Topping Fellow of tho&s;e Times) to the Per&s;on that had &s;lighted his Ad|vice. The Major never enquired into the Quar|rel, becau&s;e it was not the manner then among the very Topping Fellows; but got two Swords of an equal Length, and then waited upon Cor|net <HI>Modi&s;h,</HI> de&s;iring him to choo&s;e his Sword, and meet his Friend Captain <HI>Smart.</HI> Cornet <HI>Modi&s;h</HI> came with his Friend to the Place of Combat; there the Principals put on their Pumps, and &s;trip|ed to their Shirts, to &s;how they had nothing but what Men of Honour carry about 'em, and then engag'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Mark.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And did the Seconds &s;tand by Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Plume.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It was a received Cu&s;tom till that Time; but the Swords of tho&s;e Days being pretty long, and the Principals acting on both Sides upon the Defen&s;ive, and the Morning be|ing fro&s;ty, Major <HI>Adroit</HI> de&s;ired that the other Second, who was al&s;o a very Topping Fellow, would try a Thru&s;t or Two only to keep them warm, till the Principals had decided the Mat|ter, which was agreed to by <HI>Modi&s;h</HI>'s Second, who pre&s;ently whipt <HI>Adroit</HI> through the Body, di&s;arm'd him, and then parted the Principals, who had receiv'd no Harm at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Sage.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But was not <HI>Adroit</HI> laugh'd at?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Plume.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>On the Contrary, the very Top|ping Fellows were ever after of Opinion. That no Man who de&s;erved that Character, could &s;erve as a Second, without Fighting; and the Smarts and Modi&s;hes finding their Account in it, the Humour took without Oppo&s;ition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Sage.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pray Colonel, How long did that Fa&s;hion continue?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Plume.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not long neither, Mr. <HI>Sage;</HI> for as &s;oon as it became a Fa&s;hion, the very Top|ping Fellows thought their Honour reflected up|on,
<PB N="286" REF="301">
if they did not proffer them&s;elves as Seconds when any of their Friends had a Quarrel; &s;o that &s;ometimes there were a Dozen of a Side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Mark.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ble&s;s me! If that Cu&s;tom had con|tinued, we &s;hould have been at a Lo&s;s now for our very Pretty Fellows; for they &s;eem to be the proper Men to officer, animate, and keep up an Army: But, pray Sir, How did that &s;ociable Manner of Tilting grow out of Mode?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Plume.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, I'll tell you: It was a Law among the Combatants, That the Party which happen'd to have the fir&s;t Man di&s;arm'd or kill'd, &s;hould yield as vanqui&s;h'd; which &s;ome People thought might encourage the Modi&s;hes and Smarts in quarrelling, to the De&s;truction of only the very Topping Fellows; and as &s;oon as this Reflection was &s;tarted, the very Topping Fellows thought it an Incumbrance upon their Honour to fight at all them&s;elves. Since that Time, the Modi&s;hes and the Smarts, through|out all <HI>Europe,</HI> have extoll'd the <HI>French</HI> King's Edict.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Mark.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Our very pretty Fellows, whom I take to be the Succe&s;&s;ors of the very Topping Fellows, think a Quarrel &s;o little Fa&s;hionable, that they will not be expos'd to it by another Man's Vanity, or Want of Sen&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Sage.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But, Colonel, I have ob&s;erv'd in your Account of Duels, that there was a great Exactne&s;s in avoiding all Advantage that might po&s;&s;ibly be between the Combatants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Plume.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, Sir; for the Wea|pons were always equal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Sage.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; but &s;uppo&s;e an active, adroit, &s;trong Man, had in&s;ulted an aukward, or a feeble, or an unpractis'd Swords-man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Plume.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, they fought with Pi|&s;tols.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="287" REF="302">
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Sage.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, there might be a certain Advantage that Way; for a good Marks-man will be &s;ure to hit his Man at 20 Yards Di&s;tance; and a Man who&s;e Hand &s;hakes (which is com|mon to Men that debauch in Plea&s;ures, or have not us'd Pi&s;tols out of their Hol&s;ters) won't venture to fire, unle&s;s he touches the Per&s;on he &s;hoots at. Now, Sir, I am of Opinion, that one can get no Honour in killing a Man (if one has it all Rug) as the Game&s;ters &s;ay, when they have a Trick to make the Game &s;ecure, though they &s;eem to play upon the Square.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Mark.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In Truth, Mr. <HI>Sage,</HI> I think &s;uch a Fact mu&s;t be Murder in a Man's own private Con&s;cience, whatever it may appear to the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Plume.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have known &s;ome Men &s;o nice, that they would not fight but upon a Cloak without Pi&s;tols.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Sage.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe a Cu&s;tom, well e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, would outdo the Grand Monarch's Edict.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Mark.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And Bullies would then leave off their long Swords; but I don't find that a very Pretty Fellow can &s;tay to change his Sword, when he is in&s;ulted by a Bully with a long Diego, tho' his own at the &s;ame Time be no longer than a Pen-knife; which will certainly be the Ca&s;e, if &s;uch little Swords are in Mode. Pray Colonel, how was it between the Hectors of your Time and the very Topping Fellows?</P>

<P>Much might be &s;aid for the Improvement of this Sy&s;tem; which, for its Style and Invention, may in&s;truct Generals and their Hi&s;torians, both in fighting a Battle, and de&s;cribing it when 'tis over.

<P>Indeed I am extremely concerned for the Lieu|tenant-General, who, by his Overthrow and De|feat, is made a deplorable In&s;tance of the For|tune of War, and Vici&s;&s;itudes of humane Affairs.

The Art of Subdividing fir&s;t, and Dividing afterwards, is new and &s;ur|pri&s;ing; and according to this Method, the Troops are di&s;po&s;ed in <HI>Kings-Head-Court</HI> and <HI>Red-Lion-Market:</HI> Nor is the Conduct of the&s;e Leaders le&s;s con&s;picuous in their Choice of the
<PB N="300" REF="315">Ground or Field of Battle. Happy was it, that the greate&s;t Part of the Atchievements of this Day was to be performed near <HI>Grub-&s;treet,</HI> that there might not be wanting a &s;ufficient Number of faithful Hi&s;torians. who being Eye-Witne&s;&s;es of the&s;e Wonders, &s;hould impartially tran&s;mit them to Po&s;terity: But then it can never be e|nough regretted, that we are left in the Dark as to the Name and Title of that extraordinary Hero who commanded the Divi&s;ions in <HI>Paul's-Alley;</HI> e&s;pecially becau&s;e tho&s;e Divi&s;ions are ju&s;t|ly &s;tyled Brave, and accordingly were to pu&s;h the Enemy along <HI>Bunhill-Row,</HI> and thereby occa|&s;ion a general Battle.

<P>Some Part of the Company keep up the old Way of Conver&s;ation in this Place, which u&s;ual|ly turned upon the Examination of Nature, and an Enquiry into the Manners of Men.

This led my Friend and me to weigh this wandring Manner in many other In|cidents, and he took out of his Pockets &s;everal little Notes or Tickets to &s;ollicit for Votes to Employments: As, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. <HI>John Tapla&s;h</HI> having &s;erved all Offices, and being reduced to great Poverty, de&s;ires your Vote for Singing-Clerk of this Pari&s;h.

<P>LOoking over &s;ome old Papers, I found a little Treati&s;e, written by my Great-Grandfather, concerning <HI>Bribery,</HI> and thought his Manner of treating that Subject not unworthy my Remark. He there has a Digre&s;&s;ion concerning a Po&s;&s;ibi|lity, that in &s;ome Circum&s;tances a Man may re|ceive an Injury, and yet be con&s;cious to him&s;elf that he de&s;erves it. There are abundance of fine Things &s;aid on the Subject; but the whole wrap'd up in &s;o much Jingle and Pun, (which was the Wit of tho&s;e Times) that it is &s;carce in|telligible; but I thought the De&s;ign was well enough in the following Sketch of the old Gen|tleman's Poetry: For in this Ca&s;e, where Two are Rivals for the &s;ame Thing, and propo&s;e to obtain it by Pre&s;ents, he that attempts the Judge's Ho|ne&s;ty, by making him Offers of Reward, ought not to complain when he lo&s;es his Cau&s;e by a bet|ter Bidder.

<P>The Di&s;cour&s;e happen'd this Evening to fall upon Characters drawn in Plays, and a Gentle|man remark'd, That there was no Method in the World of knowing the Ta&s;te of an Age, or Period of Time &s;o good, as by the Ob&s;ervations of the Per&s;ons repre&s;ented in their Comedies. There were &s;everal In&s;tances produced, as <HI>Ben. John&s;on</HI>'s bringing in a Fellow &s;moaking as a Piece of Foppery; but, &s;aid the Gentleman, (who entertain'd us on this Subject) this Matter is no where &s;o ob&s;ervable as in the Difference of the Characters of Women on the Stage in the la&s;t Age, and in this. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that it was a Poverty of Genius in <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> that his Women made &s;o &s;mall a Figure in his Dialogues; but it certainly is, that he drew Women as they then were in Life; for that Sex had not in tho&s;e Days that Freedom in Conver|&s;ation; and their Characters were only, that they were Mothers, Si&s;ters, Daughters, and Wives. There were not then among the Ladies, &s;hining Wits, Politicians, Virtuo&s;ae, Free-Thinkers, and Di&s;putants; nay, there was then hardly &s;uch a Creature ev'n as a Coquet: But Vanity had quite another Turn, and the mo&s;t con&s;picuous
<PB N="306" REF="323">
Woman at that Time of Day was only the be&s;t Hou&s;ewife. Were it po&s;&s;ible to bring into Life an A&s;&s;embly of Matrons of that Age, and intro|duce the learned Lady <HI>Woodby</HI> into their Com|pany, they would not believe the &s;ame Nation could produce a Creature &s;o unlike any Thing they ever &s;aw in it.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Ancients would be as much a&s;toni&s;h'd to &s;ee in the &s;ame Age &s;o illu&s;trious a Pattern to all who love Things Prai&s;e-worthy, as the di|vine <HI>A&s;pa&s;ia.</HI> Methinks, I now &s;ee her walking in her Garden like our fir&s;t Parent, with unaf|fected Charms, before Beauty had Spectators, and bearing cele&s;tial con&s;cious Virtue in her A&s;|pect. Her Countenance is the lively Picture of her Mind, which is the Seat of Honour, Truth, Compa&s;&s;ion, Knowledge, and Innocence.
<Q><L>There dwells the Scorn of Vice and Pity too.</L></Q>
In the Mid&s;t of the mo&s;t ample Fortune, and Veneration of all that behold and know her, without the lea&s;t Affectation, &s;he con&s;ults Re|tirement, the Contemplation of her own Being, and that &s;upreme Power which be&s;towed it. Without the Learning of Schools, or Knowledge of a long Cour&s;e of Arguments, &s;he goes on in a &s;teady Cour&s;e of uninterrupted Piety and Vir|tue, and adds to the Severity and Privacy of the la&s;t Age all the Freedom and Ea&s;e of this. The Language and Mien of a Court &s;he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in the highe&s;t Degree; but the Simplicity and humble Thoughts of a Cottage, are her more welcome Entertainments. <HI>A&s;pa&s;ia</HI> is a Female Philo&s;opher, who does not only live up to the Re&s;ignation of the mo&s;t retired Lives of the ancient Sages, but al&s;o to the Schemes and Plans which they thought beautiful, tho' inimi|table. This Lady is the mo&s;t exact Oeconomi&s;t, without appearing bu&s;ie; the mo&s;t &s;trictly vir|tuous,
<PB N="307" REF="324">
without ta&s;ting the Prai&s;e of it; and &s;huns Applau&s;e with as much Indu&s;try, as others do Reproach. This Character is &s;o particular, that it will very ea&s;ily be fixed on her only, by all that know her: But I dare &s;ay, &s;he will be the la&s;t that finds it out.</P>
<P>But, alas! If we have One or Two &s;uch La|dies, How many Dozens are there like the re&s;t|le&s;s <HI>Poluglo&s;&s;a,</HI> who is acquainted with all the World but her &s;elf; who has the Appearance of all, and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of no one Virtue: She has indeed in her Practice the Ab&s;ence of Vice, but her Di&s;|cour&s;e is the continual Hi&s;tory of it; and it is apparent, when &s;he &s;peaks of the criminal Grati|fications of others, that her Innocence is only a Re&s;traint, with a certain Mixture of Envy. She is &s;o perfectly oppo&s;ite to the Character of <HI>A&s;pa|&s;ia,</HI> that as Vice is terrible to her only as it is the Object of Reproach, &s;o Virtue is agreeable only as it is attended with Applau&s;e.</P>

<P>I Write from hence at pre&s;ent to complain, That Wit and Merit are &s;o little encouraged by People of Rank and Quality, that the Wits of the Age are obliged to run within <HI>Temple-Bar</HI> for Patronage. There is a deplorable In|&s;tance of this in the Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>D&mdash;y,</HI> who has dedicated his inimitable Comedy, called, <HI>The Modern Prophets,</HI> to a worthy Knight, to whom, it &s;eems, he had before communicated his Plan, which was, <HI>To Ridicule the Ridiculers of our e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Doctrine.</HI> I have el&s;ewhere celebrated the Contrivance of this excellent <HI>Drama;</HI> but was

There is however in this Epi&s;tle the true Life of Panegyrical Performance; and I do not doubt but, if the Patron would part with it, I can help him to others with good Preten&s;ions to it; <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Uncommon Under&s;tanding,</HI> who would give him as much as he gave for it.

<Q><P>Your Ea&s;ine&s;s of Humour, or rather your harmo|nious Di&s;po&s;ition, is &s;o admirably mixed with your Compo&s;ure, that the rugged Cares and Di&s;turbance that Publick Affairs brings with it, which does &s;o vexatiou&s;ly affect the Heads of other great Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> does &s;carce ever ruffle your un louded Brow &s;o much as with a Frown.

<P>But I find, Sir, I am now got into a very large Field, where tho' I could with great Ea&s;e rai&s;e a Number of Plants in Relation to your Merit of this plauditory Nature; yet for Fear of an Author's general Vice, and that the plain Ju&s;tice I have done you &s;hould, by my Proceeding and others mi|&s;taken Judgment, be imagined Flattery, a Thing the Bluntne&s;s of my Nature does not care to be con|cern'd with, and which I al&s;o know you abomi|nate.</P></Q>

<P>The Learned have &s;o long laboured under the Imputation of Dryne&s;s and Dulne&s;s in their Ac|counts of their Phaenomena, that an ingenious Gentleman of our Society has re&s;olved to write a Sy&s;tem of Philo&s;ophy in a more lively Method, both as to the Matter and Language, than has been hitherto attempted. He read to us the Plan upon which he intends to proceed. I thought his Account, by Way of Fable of the Worlds about us, had &s;o much Vivacity in it, that I could not forbear tran&s;cribing his Hypothe&s;is, to give the Reader a Ta&s;te of my Friend's Treati&s;e, which is now in the Pre&s;s.</P>
<Q><P>The Inferior Deities having de&s;igned on a Day to play a Game at Football, knead toge|ther a numberle&s;s Collection of dancing Atoms into the Form of Seven rowling Globes: And that Nature might be kept from a dull In|activity, each &s;eparate Particle is endued with a Principle of Motion, or a Power of Attra|ction,
<PB N="313" REF="330">
whereby all the &s;everal Parcels of Mat|ter draw each other proportionably to their Magnitudes and Di&s;tances, into &s;uch a re|markable Variety of different Forms, as to produce all the wonderful Appearances we now ob&s;erve in Empire, Philo&s;ophy, and Re|ligion. But to proceed.</P>
<P>At the Beginning of the Game, each of the Globes being &s;truck forward with a va&s;t Vio|lence, ran out of Sight, and wander'd in a &s;traight Line thro' the infinite Spaces. The nim|ble Deities pur&s;ue, breathle&s;s almo&s;t, and &s;pent in the eager Chace; each of them catched hold of one, and &s;tamped it with his Name; as, <HI>Sa|turn, Jupiter, Mars,</HI> and &s;o of the re&s;t. To prevent this Inconveniene for the future, the Seven are condemned to a Precipitation, which in our inferior Style we call <HI>Gravity.</HI> Thus the Tangential and Centripetal Forces, by their Counter-&s;truggle, make the Cele&s;tial Bodies de&s;cribe an exact Ellip&s;is.</P></Q>

<P>We were upon the Heroick Strain this Even|ing, and the Que&s;tion was, What is the True Sublime? Many very good Di&s;cour&s;es happen'd thereupon; after which a Gentleman at the Table, who is, it &s;eems, writing on that Sub|ject, a&s;&s;um'd the Argument; and tho' he ran thro' many In&s;tances of Sublimity from the an|cient Writers, &s;aid, He had hardly known an Occa&s;ion wherein the true Greatne&s;s of Soul, which animates a General in Action, is &s;o well repre&s;ented, with Regard to the Per&s;on of whom it was &s;poken, and the Time in which it was writ, as in a few Lines in a modern Poem: There is (continued he) nothing &s;o forc'd and con&s;train'd, as what we frequently meet with in Tragedies; to make a Man under the Weight of a great Sorrow, or full of Meditation upon what he is &s;oon to execute, ca&s;t about for a Si|mile to what he him&s;elf is, or the Thing which he is going to act: But there is nothing more proper and natural for a Poet, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s is to de&s;cribe, and who is Spectator of one in that Circum&s;tance when his Mind is working upon a great Image, and that the Idea's hurry upon his Imagination; I &s;ay, there is nothing &s;o natural, as for a Poet to relieve and clear him&s;elf from the Burthen of Thought at that Time, by uttering his Conception in Simile and Metaphor. The highe&s;t Act of the Mind of Man, is to po&s;&s;e&s;s it &s;elf with Tranquility in eminent Danger, and to have its Thoughts &s;o free, as to act at that Time without Perplexity. The ancient Authors have compared this &s;edate Courage to a Rock that remains immoveable
<PB N="315" REF="332">
amid&s;t the Rage of Winds and Waves; but that is too &s;tupid and inanimate a Similitude, and could do no Credit to the Hero. At other Times they are all of 'em wonderfully obliged to a <HI>Lybian</HI> Lion, which may give indeed very agreeable Terrors to a De&s;cription; but is no Compliment to the Per&s;on to whom it is appli|ed: Eagles, Tygers, and Wolves, are made U&s;e of on the &s;ame Occa&s;ion, and very often with much Beauty; but this is &s;till an Honour done to the Brute, rather than the Hero. <HI>Mars, Pal|las, Bacchus,</HI> and <HI>Hercules,</HI> have each of 'em furni&s;h'd very good Similes in their Time, and made, doubtle&s;s, a greater Impre&s;&s;ion on the Mind of a Heathen, than they have on that of a modern Reader. But the &s;ublime Image that I am talking of, and which I really think as great as ever enter'd into the Thought of Man, is in the Poem call'd, <HI>The Campaign;</HI> where the Si|mile of a mini&s;tring Angel &s;ets forth the mo&s;t &s;edate and the mo&s;t active Courage, engaged in an Uproar of Nature, a Confu&s;ion of Ele|ments, and a Scene of Divine Vengeance. Add to all, That the&s;e Lines compliment the General and his Queen at the &s;ame Time, and have all the natural Horrors, heighten'd by the Image that was &s;till fre&s;h in the Mind of every Rea|der.</P>
<Q><L>'Twas then Great <HI>Marlbro</HI>'s mighty Soul was prov'd,</L>
<L>That, in the Shock of charging Ho&s;ts unmov'd,</L>
<L>Amid&s;t Confu&s;ion, Horror, and De&s;pair,</L>
<L>Examin'd all the dreadful Scenes of War;</L>
<L>In peaceful Thought the Field of Death &s;urvey'd,</L>
<L>To fainting Squadrons &s;ent the timely Aid,</L>
<L>In&s;pir'd repuls'd Battalions to engage,</L>
<L>And taught the doubtful Battle where to rage.</L>
<L>So when an Angel by Divine Command,</L>
<L>With ri&s;ing Tempe&s;ts &s;hakes a guilty Land,</L>
<L><PB N="316" REF="333">
Such as of late o'er pale <HI>Britannia</HI> pa&s;t,</L>
<L>Calm and &s;erene he drives the furious Bla&s;t;</L>
<L>And, pleas'd th' Almighty's Orders to perform,</L>
<L>Rides in the Whirl-wind, and directs the Storm.</L></Q>
<P>The whole Poem is &s;o exqui&s;itely Noble and Poetick, that I think it an Honour to our Na|tion and Language. The Gentleman concluded his Critick on this Work, by &s;aying, that he e&s;teemed it wholly new, and a wonderful At|tempt to keep up the ordinary Idea's of a March of an Army, ju&s;t as they happen'd in &s;o warm and great a Style, and yet be at once Familiar and Heroick. Such a Performance is a Chroni|cle as well as a Poem, and will pre&s;erve the Me|mory of our Hero, when all the Edifices and Statues erected to his Honour are blended with common Du&s;t.</P>

<P>THIS Day, pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> I was &s;topp'd in the Piazza by <HI>Pacolet,</HI> to ob&s;erve what he called the Triumph of Love and Youth. I turned to the Object he pointed at; and there I &s;aw a gay gilt Chariot drawn by fre&s;h prancing Hor&s;es; the Coachman with a new Cockade, and the Lacques with In&s;olence and Plenty in their Countenances. I asked im|mediately, What young Heir or Lover own'd that glittering Equipage? But my Companion interrupted: Do not you &s;ee there the mourning <HI>Ae&s;culapius?</HI> The Mourning! &s;aid I. Yes <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Pacolet,</HI> He is in deep Mourning, and is the langui&s;hing hopele&s;s Lover of the divine <HI>Hebe,</HI> the Emblem of Youth and Beauty. The excellent and
<PB N="318" REF="335">
learned Sage you behold in that Furniture, is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tronge&s;t In&s;tance imaginable, that Love is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> mo&s;t powerful of all Things:</P>
<P>You are not &s;o ignorant as to be a Stranger to the Character of <HI>Ae&s;culapius,</HI> as the Patron and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful of all who profe&s;s the Art of Me|dicine. But as mo&s;t of his Operations are owing to a natural Sagacity or Impul&s;e, he has very little troubled him&s;elf with the Doctrine of Drugs; but has always given Nature more Room to help her &s;elf, than any of her learned A&s;&s;i&s;tants; and con&s;equently has done greater Wonders than is in the Power of Art to perform: For which Rea&s;on he is half deify'd by the People; and has ever been ju&s;tly courted by all the World, as if he were a Seventh Son.</P>
<P>It happen'd, that the charming <HI>Hebe</HI> was re|duced, by a long and violent Fever, to the mo&s;t extreme Danger of Death; and when all Skill fail'd, they &s;ent for <HI>Ae&s;culapius.</HI> The renowned Arti&s;t was touch'd with the deepe&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion to &s;ee the faded Charms and faint Bloom of <HI>Hebe;</HI> and had a generous Concern in beholding a Strug|gle, not between Life, but rather between Youth and Death. All his Skill and his Pa&s;&s;ion tended to the Recovery of <HI>Hebe,</HI> beautiful even in Sickne&s;s: But, alas! the unhappy Phy&s;ician knew not, that in all his Care he was only &s;harpening Darts for his own De&s;truction. In a Word, his Fortune was the &s;ame with that of the Statuary, who fell in Love with the Image of his own making; and the unfortunate <HI>Ae&s;culapius</HI> is become the Patient of her whom he lately recovered. Long before this Di&s;a&s;ter, <HI>Ae&s;culapius</HI> was far gone in the unnece&s;|&s;ary and &s;uperfluous Amu&s;ements of old Age, in increa&s;ing unweildy Stores, and providing, in the mid&s;t of an Incapacity of Enjoyment of what he had, for a Supply of more Wants than he had Calls for in Youth it &s;elf. But the&s;e low Con&s;iderations
<PB N="319" REF="336">
are now no more, and Love has taken Place of Avarice, or rather is become an Avarice of ano|ther Kind, which &s;till urges him to pur&s;ue what he does not want. But behold the Matamorpho&s;is; the anxious mean Cares of an U&s;urer are turned into the Langui&s;hments and Complaints of a Lover. Behold, &s;ays the aged <HI>Ae&s;culapius,</HI> I &s;ub|mit, I own, great Love, thy Empire: Pity, <HI>Hebe,</HI> the Fop you have made: What have I to do with Guilding but on Pills? Yet, O Fair! For thee I &s;it amid&s;t a Crowd of painted Deities on my Chariot, button'd in Gold, cla&s;p'd in Gold, with|out having any Value for that beloved Metal, but as it adorns the Per&s;on, and laces the Hat of thy dying Lover. I ask not to live, O <HI>Hebe!</HI> Give me but gentle Death: <HI>Euthana&s;ia, Eutha|na&s;ia,</HI> that is all I implore. When <HI>Ae&s;culapius</HI> had fini&s;hed his Complaint, <HI>Pacolet</HI> went on in deep Morals on the Incertainty of Riches with this remarkable Exclamation; O Wealth! How im|potent art thou? And how little do&s;t thou &s;up|ply us with real Happine&s;s, when the U&s;urer him&s;elf can forget thee for the Love of what is as foreign to his Felicity as thou art?</P>

The Action at both tho&s;e Parts of the Town was very ob&s;tinate, and the Allies lo&s;t a con&s;iderable Number at the Beginning of the Di&s;pute; but the Fight was continued with &s;o great Bravery, that the Enemy ob&s;erving our Men to be Ma&s;ters of all the Po&s;ts which were nece&s;&s;ary for a general Attack, beat the <HI>Cha|made,</HI> and Ho&s;tages were receiv'd from the Town, and others &s;ent from the Befiegers, in order to come to a formal Capitulation for the Surrender of the Place. We have al&s;o this Day received Advice, That Sir <HI>John Leak,</HI> who lies off of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> had intercepted &s;everal Ships la|den with Corn from the <HI>Baltick;</HI> and that the

<P>THE other Day I took a Walk a Mile or Two|out of Town, and &s;trolling wherever Chance led me, I was in&s;en&s;ibly carried into a By-Road, along which was a very agreeable Quick&s;et, of an extraordinary Height, which &s;urrounded a very delicious Seat and Garden. From one Angle of the Hedge, I heard a Voice cry, Sir, Sir&mdash;This rais'd my Curio&s;ity, and I heard the &s;ame Voice &s;ay, but in a gentle Tone, Come forward, come forward. I did &s;o, and one through the Hedge called me by my Name, and bad me go on to the Left, and I &s;hould be admitted to vi&s;it an old Acquaintance in Di&s;tre&s;s. The Laws of Knight Errantry made me obey the Summons without He&s;itation; and I was let in at the Back-Gate of a lovely Hou&s;e by a Maid-Servant, who carried me from Room to Room, till I came into a Gallery; at the End of which, I &s;aw a fine Lady dre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t &s;umptuous Habit, as if &s;he were going to a Ball, but with the mo&s;t abject and di&s;con&s;olate Sorrow in her Face
<PB N="324" REF="341">
that I ever beheld. As I came near, &s;he bur&s;t into Tears, and cry'd, Sir, Do not you know the unhappy <HI>Teraminta?</HI> I &s;oon recollected her whole Per&s;on: But (&s;aid I) Madam, The Sim|plicity of Dre&s;s, in which I have ever &s;een you at your good Father's Hou&s;e, and the Chearful|ne&s;s of Countenance with which you always appeared, are &s;o unlike the Fa&s;hion and Temper you are now in, that I did not ea&s;ily recover the Memory of you. Your habit was then decent and mode&s;t, your Looks &s;erene and beautiful: Whence then this unaccountable Change? No|thing can &s;peak &s;o deep a Sorrow as your pre&s;ent A&s;pect; yet your Dre&s;s is made for Jollity and Re|velling. It is (&s;aid &s;he) an un&s;peakable Plea&s;ure to meet with one I know, and to bewail my &s;elf to any that is not an utter Stranger to Humanity.</P>
<P>When your Friend my Father died, he left me to a wide World, with no Defence again&s;t the In&s;ults of Fortune, but rather, a Thou&s;and Snares to intrap me in the Dangers to which Youth and Innocence are expo&s;ed, in an Age wherein Honour and Virtue are become mere Words, and u&s;ed only as they &s;erve to be|tray tho&s;e who under&s;tand them in their native Sen&s;e, and obey them as the Guides and Mo|tives of their Being. The wickede&s;t of all Men living, the abandoned <HI>Decius,</HI> who has no Know|ledge of any good Art or Purpo&s;e of Humane Life, but as it tends to the Satisfaction of his Ap|petites, had Opportunities of frequently &s;eeing and entertaining me at a Hou&s;e where mixed Company boarded, and where he placed him|&s;elf for the ba&s;e Intention which he has &s;ince brought to pa&s;s. <HI>Decius</HI> &s;aw enough in me to rai&s;e his brural De&s;ires, and my Circum&s;tances gave him Hopes of accompli&s;hing them. But a l the glittering Expectations he could lay be|fore me, joined by my private Terrors of Po|verty
<PB N="325" REF="342">
it &s;elf, could not for &s;ome Months prevail upon me; yet however I hated his Intention, I &s;till had a &s;ecret Satisfaction in his Court&s;hip, and always expo&s;ed my &s;elf to his Solicitations. See here the Bane of our Sex! Let the Flatte|ry be never &s;o apparent, the Flatterer never &s;o ill thought of, his Prai&s;es are &s;till agreeable, and we contribute to our own Deceit. I was there|fore ever fond of all Opportunities and Pretences of being in his Company. In a Word, I was at la&s;t ruined by him, and brought to this Place, where I have been ever &s;ince immur'd; and from the fatal Day after my Fall from Inno|cence, my Wor&s;hipper became my Ma&s;ter and my Tyrant.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee me habited in the mo&s;t gorge|ous Manner, not in Honour of me as a Wo|man he loves, but as this Attire charms his own Eye, and urges him to repeat the Gratifi|cation he takes in me, as the Servant of his bruti&s;h Lu&s;ts and Appetites. I know not where to fly for Redre&s;s; but am here pining away Life in the Solitude and Severity of a Nun, but the Con&s;cience and Guilt of an Harlot. I live in this lewd Practice with a Religious Awe of my Mini&s;ter of Darkne&s;s, upbraided with the Support I receive from him, for the ine&s;timable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Youth, of Innocence, of Honour, and of Con&s;cience. I &s;ee, Sir, my Di&s;cour&s;e grows painful to you, all I beg of you is, to paint in &s;o &s;trong Colours, as to let <HI>Decius</HI> &s;ee I am di&s;covered to be in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that I may be turned out of this dete&s;table Scene of regular Iniquity, and either think no more, or &s;in no more. If your Writings have the good Effect of gaining my Enlargement, I promi&s;e you I will atone for this unhappy Step, by pre|ferring an innocent laborious Poverty, to all the guilty Affluence the World can offer me.</P>

<P>HAD the Family of the <HI>Beadle&s;taffs,</HI> where|of I, tho' unworthy, am one, known of your being lately at <HI>Oxon,</HI> we had in our own Name, and in the Univer&s;ities, (as it is our Office) made you a Compliment: But your &s;hort Stay here robbed us of an Opportunity of paying our due Re&s;pects, and you of re|ceiving an ingenious Entertainment, with which we at pre&s;ent divert our &s;elves and Strangers. A <HI>Puppet-Show</HI> at this Time &s;up|plies the Want of an <HI>ACT.</HI> And &s;ince the Nymphs of this City are di&s;appointed of a lu&s;|cious Mu&s;ick-Speech, and the Country Ladies of hearing their Sons or Brothers &s;peak Ver|&s;es; yet the vocal Machines, like them, by the Help of a Prompter, &s;ay Things as much to the Benefit of the Audience, and almo&s;t as properly their own. The Licence of a <HI>Terra-Filius</HI> is refined to the well-bred Satyr of <HI>Pun|chenella.</HI> Now, Cou&s;in <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> tho' <HI>Punch</HI>

Yet, by &s;ome Indecencies towards the Ladies, he &s;eems to be of a Third Cha|racter, di&s;tinct from any you have yet touch'd upon. A young Gentleman who &s;ate next me (for I had the Curio&s;ity of &s;eeing this Enter|tainment) in a tufted Gown, red Stockings, and long Wig, (which I pronounce to be tantamount to red Heels and a dangling Cane) was enraged when <HI>Punchenello</HI> di&s;tur|bed a &s;oft Love-Scene with his Ribaldry. You would oblige us mightily by laying down &s;ome Rules for adju&s;ting the extravagant Be|haviour of this <HI>Almanzor</HI> of the Play, and by writing a Treati&s;e on this Sort of Dramatick Poetry, &s;o much favoured, and &s;o little un|der&s;tood, by the learned World.</P>
<P>From its being conveyed in a Cart after the <HI>The&s;pian</HI> Manner, all the Parts being recited by one Per&s;on, as the Cu&s;tom was before <HI>Ae&s;|chilus,</HI> and from the Behaviour of <HI>Punch</HI> as if he had won the Goal, you may po&s;&s;ibly deduce its Antiquity, and &s;ettle the Chronology, as well as &s;ome of our Modern Criticks.

<P>I am got hither &s;afe, but never &s;pent Time with &s;o little Satisfaction as this Evening; for you mu&s;t know, I was Five Hours with Three <HI>Merry,</HI> and Two <HI>Hone&s;t Fellows.</HI> The for|mer &s;ang Catches; and the latter even died with laughing at the Noi&s;e they made. Well, (&s;ays <HI>Tom Belfrey</HI>) You Scholars, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> are the wor&s;t Company in the World. Ay, (&s;ays his Oppo&s;ite) You are dull to Night; pri|thee be merry. With that I huzza'd, and took a Jump cro&s;s the Table, then came clever upon my Legs, and fell a laughing. Let Mr. <HI>Bicker|&s;taff</HI> alone (&s;ays one of the <HI>Hone&s;t Fellows</HI>), when he's in a good Humour, he's as good Company as any Man in <HI>England.</HI> He had no &s;ooner &s;poke, but I &s;natched his Hat off his Head, and clap'd it upon my own, and bur&s;t out a laughing again; upon which we all fell a laugh|ing for half an Hour. One of the <HI>Hone&s;t Fel|lows</HI> got behind me in the Interim, and hit me a &s;ound Slap on the Back; upon which he got the Laugh out of my Hands, and it was &s;uch a Twang on my Shoulders, that I confe&s;s he was much merrier than I. I was half angry; but re&s;olved to keep up the good Humour of
<PB N="329" REF="346">
the Company; and after hollowing as loud as I could po&s;&s;ibly, I drank off a Bumper of Cla|ret, that made me &s;tare again. Nay, (&s;ays one of the <HI>Hone&s;t Fellows</HI>) Mr. <HI>I&s;aac</HI> is in the Right, there is no Conver&s;ation in this; What fignifies Jumping, or hitting one another on the Back? Let's drink about. We did &s;o from Seven a Clock till Eleven; and now I am come hither, and, after the Manner of the wi&s;e <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> begin to reflect upon the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Day. I remember nothing, but that I am brui&s;ed to Death; and as it is my Way to write down all the good Things I have heard in the la&s;t Con|ver&s;ation to furni&s;h my Paper, I can from this only tell you my Sufferings, and my Bangs.</P>
<P>I nam'd <HI>Pythagoras</HI> ju&s;t now, and I prote&s;t to you, as he believ'd Men after Death enter'd in|to other Species, I am now and then tempted to think other Animals enter into Men, and could name &s;everal on Two Legs, that never di&s;cover any Sentiment above what is common with the Species of a lower Kind; as we &s;ee in the&s;e bo|dily Wits whom I was with to Night, who&s;e Parts con&s;i&s;t in Strength and Activity; but their boi&s;terous Mirth gives me great Impatience for the Return of &s;uch Happine&s;s as I enjoyed in a Conver&s;ation la&s;t Week. Among others in that Company, we had <HI>Florio,</HI> who never interrupt|ed any Man living when he was &s;peaking; or ever cea&s;ed to &s;peak, but others lamented that he had done. His Di&s;cour&s;e ever ari&s;es from a Fulne&s;s of the Matter before him, and not from O&s;tentation or Triumph of his Under&s;tanding; for though he &s;eldom delivers what he need fear being repeated, he &s;peaks without having that End in View; and his Forbearance of Calumny or Bitterne&s;s, is owing rather to his good Na|ture than his Di&s;cretion; for which Rea&s;on, he is e&s;teem'd a Gentleman perfectly qualified for
<PB N="330" REF="347">
Conver&s;ation, in whom a general Good-will to Mankind takes off the Nece&s;&s;ity of Caution and Circum&s;pection.</P>
<P>We had at the &s;ame Time that Evening the be&s;t Sort of Companion that can be, a good-na|tured old Man. This Per&s;on meets in the Com|pany of young Men, Veneration for his Benevo|lence, and is not only valued for the good Quali|ties of which he is Ma&s;ter, but reaps an Accep|tance from the Pardon he gives to other Men Faults: And the ingenious Sort of Men with whom he conver&s;es, have &s;o ju&s;t a Regard for him, that he rather is an Example, than a Check to their Behaviour. For this Rea&s;on, as <HI>Senecio</HI> never pretends to be a Man of Plea&s;ure before Youth, &s;o young Men never &s;et up for Wi&s;dom before <HI>Senecio;</HI> &s;o that you never meet, where he is, tho&s;e Mon&s;ters of Conver&s;ation, who are grave or gay above their Years. He never conver&s;es but with Followers of Nature and good Sen&s;e, where all that is uttered is only the Effect of a communicable Temper, and not of Emulation to excel their Companions; all De&s;ire of Su|periority being a Contradiction to that Spirit which makes a ju&s;t Conver&s;ation, the very E&s;|&s;ence of which is mutual Good-will. Hence it is, that I take it for a Rule, that the natural, and not the acquired Man, is the Companion. Learning, Wit, Gallantry, and good Breeding, are all but &s;ubordinate Qualities in Society, and are of no Value, but as they are &s;ub&s;ervient to Benevolence, and tend to a certain Manner of being or appear|ing equal to the re&s;t of the Company; for Con|ver&s;ation is compo&s;ed of an A&s;&s;embly of Men, as they are Men, and not as they are di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by Fortune: Therefore he that brings his Qua|lity with him into Conver&s;ation, &s;hould always pay the Reckoning; for he came to receive Homage, and not to meet his Friends.&mdash;But

<P>WE &s;ee every Day Volumes written again&s;t that Tyrant of Humane Life called <HI>Love,</HI> and yet there is no Help found again&s;t his Cruel|ties, or Barrier again&s;t the Inroads he is plea&s;ed to make into the Mind of Man. After this Preface, you will expect I am going to give par|ticular In&s;tances of what I have a&s;&s;erted. That Expectation cannot be rai&s;ed too high for the Novelty of the Hi&s;tory, and Manner of Life, of the Emperor <HI>Aurengezebe,</HI> who has re&s;ided for &s;ome Years in the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> with the Air and Mien indeed of his Imperial Quality, but the Equipage and Ap|pointment only of a private Gentleman. This Potentate, for a long Series of Time, appeared from the Hour of Twelve till that of Two at a Coffee-hou&s;e near the <HI>Change,</HI> and had a Seat (though without a Canopy) &s;acred to him&s;elf,
<PB N="332" REF="349">
where he gave diurnal Audiences concerning Commerce, Politicks, Tare and Tret, U&s;ury and Abatement, with all Things nece&s;&s;ary for helping the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, who are willing to give one Limb for the better Maintenance of the re&s;t; or &s;uch joyous Youths, who&s;e Philo|&s;ophy is confined to the pre&s;ent Hour, and were de&s;irous to call in the Revenue of next half Year to double the Enjoyment of this. Long did this growing Monarch employ him&s;elf after this Manner: And as Alliances are nece&s;&s;ary to all great Kingdoms, he took particularly the Intere&s;ts of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Fourteenth into his Care and Protection. When all Mankind were at|tacking that unhappy Monarch, and tho&s;e who had neither Valour or Wit to oppo&s;e again&s;t him, would be &s;till &s;howing their impotent Ma|lice by laying Wagers in Oppo&s;ition to his In|tere&s;ts, <HI>Aurengezebe</HI> ever took the Part of his Contemporary, and laid immen&s;e Trea&s;ures on his Side in Defence of his important Magazine of <HI>Toulon. Aurengezebe</HI> al&s;o had all this while a con&s;tant Intelligence with <HI>India,</HI> and his Let|ters were an&s;wered in Jewels, which he &s;oon made Brillant, and cau&s;ed to be affixed to his Imperial Ca&s;tor, which he always wears cock'd in Front, to &s;how his Defiance; with an Hear of Imperial Snuff in the Middle of his ample Vi&s;age, to &s;how his Sagacity. The Zealots, for this little Spot called <HI>Great Britain,</HI> fell uni|ver&s;ally into this Emperor's Policies, and paid Homage to his &s;uperior Genius, in forfeiting their Coffers to his Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>But Wealth and Wi&s;dom are Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions too &s;olemn not to give Wearine&s;s to active Minds, without the Relief (in vacant Hours) of Wit and Love, which are the proper Amu&s;ements of the Powerful and the Wi&s;e: This Emperor therefore, with great Regularity, every Day at Five in the
<PB N="333" REF="350">
Afternoon, leaves his Money-Changers, his Pub|licans, and little Hoarders of Wealth, to their low Pur&s;uits, and a&s;cends his Chariot to drive to <HI>Will</HI>'s; where the Ta&s;te is refined, and a Re|li&s;h given to Mens Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, by a polite Skill in gratifying their Pa&s;&s;ions and Appetites. There it is that the Emperor has learned to live and to love, and not, like a Mi&s;er, to gaze only on his Ingots or his Trea&s;ures; but with a nobler Sa|tisfaction, to live the Admiration of others, for his Splendour and Happine&s;s in being Ma&s;ter of them. But a Prince is no more to be his own Caterer in his Love, than in his Food; there|fore <HI>Aurengezebe</HI> has ever in waiting Two Pur|veyors for his Di&s;hes, and his Wenches for his retired Hours, by whom the Scene of his Diver|&s;ion is prepared in the following Manner.</P>
<P>There is near <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> a Street known by the Name of <HI>Drury,</HI> which, before the Days of Chri&s;tianity, was purcha&s;ed by the Queen of <HI>Paphos,</HI> and is the only Part of <HI>Great Britain</HI> where the Tenure of Va&s;&s;alage is &s;till in Being. All that long Cour&s;e of Building is under par|ticular Di&s;tricts or Ladi&s;hips, after the Manner of Lord&s;hips in other Parts, over which Matrons of known Abilities pre&s;ide, and have, for the Support of their Age and Infirmities, certain Taxes paid out of the Rewards of the amorous Labours of the Young. This Seraglio of <HI>Great Britain</HI> is di&s;po&s;ed into convenient Allies and Apartments, and every Hou&s;e, from the Cellar to the Garret, inhabited by Nymphs of diffe|rent Orders, that Per&s;ons of every Rank may be accommodated with an immediate Con&s;ort, to allay their Flames, and partake of their Cares. Here it is, that when <HI>Aurengezebe</HI> thinks fit to give a Loo&s;e to Dalliance, the Purveyors prepare the Entertainment; and what makes it more
<PB N="334" REF="351">
augu&s;t is, that every Per&s;on concerned in the Interlude has his &s;et Part, and the Prince &s;ends before-hand Word what he de&s;igns to &s;ay, and directs al&s;o the very An&s;wer which &s;hall be made to him.</P>
<P>It has been before hinted, that this Emperor has a continual Commerce with <HI>India;</HI> and it is to be noted, that the large&s;t Stone that rich Earth has produced, is in our <HI>Aurengezebe</HI>'s Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But all Things are now di&s;po&s;ed for his Re|ception. At his Entrance into the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> a Servant delivers him his Bever of State and Love, on which is fixed this ine&s;timable Jewel as his Diadem. When he is &s;eated, the Pur|veyors, <HI>Pandarus</HI> and <HI>Nuncio,</HI> marching on each Side of the Matron of the Hou&s;e, intro|duce her into his Pre&s;ence. In the mid&s;t of the Room, they bow all together to the Dia|dem.</P>
<P>When the Matron&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Whoever thou art, (as thy awful A&s;pect &s;peaks thee a Man of Power) be propitious to this Man&s;us of Love, and let not the Severity of thy Wi&s;dom di&s;dain, that by the Repre&s;entation of naked In|nocence, or pa&s;toral Figures, we revive in thee the Memory at lea&s;t of that Power of</HI> Venus, <HI>to which all the Wi&s;e and the Brave are &s;ome Part of their Lives devoted. Aurengezebe</HI> con&s;ents by a Nod, and they go out backward.</P>
<P>After this, an unhappy Nymph, who is to be &s;uppo&s;ed ju&s;t e&s;caped from the Hands of a Ra|vi&s;her, with her Tre&s;&s;es di&s;hevel'd, runs into the Room with a Dagger in her Hand, and falls before the Emperor.</P>
<P><HI>Pity, Oh! pity! whoever thou art, an unhap|py Virgin, whom one of the Train has robbed of her Innocence; her Innocence, which was all her</HI>
<PB N="335" REF="352">
<HI>Portion&mdash;Or rather, let me die like the memora|ble</HI> Lucretia&mdash;Upon which &s;he &s;tabs her &s;elf. The Body is immediately examined after the Manner of our Coroners. <HI>Lucretia</HI> recovers by a Cup of right <HI>Nants;</HI> and the Matron, who is her next Relation, &s;tops all Proce&s;s at Law.</P>
<P>This unhappy Affair is no &s;ooner over, but a naked Mad-woman breaks into the Room, calls for her Duke, her Lord, her Emperor. As &s;oon as &s;he &s;pies <HI>Aurengezebe,</HI> the Object of all her Fury and Love, &s;he calls for Petticoats, is ready to &s;ink with Shame, and is dre&s;&s;ed in all ha&s;te in new Attire at his Charge. This un|expected Accident of the Mad-woman, makes <HI>Aurengezebe</HI> curious to know, whether others who are in their Sen&s;es can gue&s;s at his Quali|ty. For which Rea&s;on the whole Convent is examined one by one. The Matron marches in with a tawdry Country Girl&mdash;Pray <HI>Winifred,</HI> (&s;ays &s;he) Who do you think that fine Man with tho&s;e Jewels and Pearls is?&mdash;I believe (&s;ays <HI>Winifred</HI>) it is our Landlord&mdash;It mu&s;t be the Squire him&s;elf&mdash;The Emperor laughs at her Simplicity&mdash;Go Fool, &s;ays the Matron: Then turning to the Emperor&mdash;Your Greatne&s;s will pardon her Ignorance! After her, &s;everal others of different Characters are in&s;tructed to mi&s;take who he is in the &s;ame Manner: Then the whole Si&s;terhood are called together, and the Em|peror ri&s;es, and cocking his Hat, declares, He is the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and they his Concubines. A general Murmur goes through the A&s;&s;embly, and <HI>Aurengezebe</HI> certifying, that he keeps them for State rather than U&s;e; tells them, they are permitted to receive all Men into their Apart|ments; then proceeds through the Crowd, among whom he throws Medals &s;haped like Half-Crowns, and returns to his Chariot.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="353">
This being all that pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t Day a which <HI>Aurengezebe</HI> vi&s;ited the Women's Apart|ments, I con&s;ulted <HI>Pacolet</HI> concerning the Foun|dation of &s;uch &s;trange Amu&s;ements in old Age: To which he an&s;wer'd; You may remember, when I gave you an Account of my good Fortune in being drowned on the 30th Day of my Humane Life, I told you of the Di&s;a&s;ters I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have met with before I arri|ved at the End of my <HI>Stamen,</HI> which was Sixty Years. I may now add an Ob&s;ervation to you, That all who exceed that Period, except the latter Part of it is &s;pent in the Exerci&s;e of Vir|tue and Contemplation of Futurity, mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily fall into an Indecent old Age, becau&s;e, with Regard to all the Enjoyments of the Years of Vigour and Manhood, Childhood returns upon them: And as Infants ride on Sticks, build Hou&s;es in Dirt, and make Ships in Gut|ters, by a faint Idea of Things they are to act hereafter; &s;o old Men play the Lovers, Po|tentates, and Emperors, from the decaying Image of the more perfect Performances of their &s;tronger Years: Therefore be &s;ure to in|&s;ert <HI>Ae&s;culapius</HI> and <HI>Aurengezebe</HI> in your next Bill of Mortality of the Metaphorically De|funct.</P>

<P>As &s;oon as I came hither this Evening, no le&s;s than Ten People produced the following Poem, which they all reported was &s;ent to each of them by the Penny-Po&s;t from an unknown Hand. All the Battle-Writers in the Room were in Debate, who could be the Author of a Piece &s;o martially written; and every Body ap|plauded the Addre&s;s and Skill of the Author, in calling it a <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript:</HI> It being the Nature of
<PB N="337" REF="354">
a Po&s;t&s;cript to contain &s;omething very Material which was forgotten, or not clearly expre&s;&s;ed in the Letter it &s;elf. Thus, the Ver&s;es being occa|&s;ioned by a March without Beat of Drum, and that Circum&s;tance being no ways taken Notice of in any of the Stanza's, the Author calls it a Po&s;t&s;cript; not that it is a Po&s;t&s;cript, but figura|tively, becau&s;e it wants a Po&s;t&s;cript. Common Writers, when what they mean is not expre&s;&s;ed in the Book it &s;elf, &s;upply it by a Preface; but a Po&s;t&s;cript &s;eems to me the more ju&s;t Way of A|pology; becau&s;e otherwi&s;e a Man makes an Ex|cu&s;e before the Offence is committed. All the Heroick Poets were gue&s;&s;ed at for its Author; but though we could not find out his Name, yet one repeated a Couplet in <HI>Hudibras</HI> which &s;poke his Qualifications:</P>
<Q><L>I'th' mid&s;t of all this Warlike Rabble,</L>

<P>My Brethren of the Quill, the ingenious So|ciety of News-writers, having with great Spi|rit and Elegance already informed the World, that the Town of <HI>Tournay</HI> capitulated on the 28th In&s;tant, there is nothing left for me to &s;ay, but to congratulate the good Company here, that we have Rea&s;on to hope for an Opportu|nity of thanking Mr. <HI>Withers</HI> next Winter in this Place, for the Service he has done his Coun|try.

than that Gentleman, who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing Cha|racter it is, that he gives his Orders with the Familiarity, and enjoys his Fortune with the Genero&s;ity, of a Fellow-Soldier. His Grace the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> had al&s;o an eminent Part in the Reduction of this important Place. That illu|&s;trious Youth di&s;covers the peculiar Turn of Spi|rit and Greatne&s;s of Soul, which only make Men of high Birth and Quality u&s;eful to their Coun|try; and con&s;iders Nobility as an imaginary Di|&s;tinction, unle&s;s accompanied with the Practice of tho&s;e generous Virtues by which it ought to be obtained.

<P>MY Friend Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> has communicated to me his Letters from <HI>Ep&s;om</HI> of the 25th In&s;tant, which give, in general, a very good Account of the pre&s;ent Po&s;ture of Affairs in that Place; but that the Tranquility and Cor|re&s;pondence of the Company begins to be in|terrupted by the Arrival of Sir <HI>Taffety Trippet,</HI> a Fortune-hunter, who&s;e Follies are too gro&s;s to give Diver&s;ion; and who&s;e Vanity is too &s;tu|pid to let him be &s;en&s;ible that he is a publick Offence. If People will indulge a &s;plenatick Humour, it is impo&s;&s;ible to be at Ea&s;e, when &s;uch Creatures as are the Scandal of our Spe|cies, &s;et up for Gallantry and Adventures. It will be much more ea&s;y therefore to laugh Sir <HI>Taffety</HI> into Rea&s;on, than convert him from his Foppery by any &s;erious Contempt. I knew a Gentleman that made it a Maxim to open his Doors, and ever run into the Way of Bullies, to avoid their In&s;olence. The Rule will hold as well with Coxcombs: They are never morti|fied, but when they &s;ee you receive, and de|&s;pi&s;e them; otherwi&s;e they re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that it is your Ignorance makes them out of your good Graces; or, that 'tis only want of Admit|tance prevents their being amiable where they are &s;hun'd and avoided. But Sir <HI>Taffety</HI> is a Fop of &s;o &s;anguine a Complexion, that I fear it will
<PB N="341" REF="358">
be very hard for the fair One he at pre&s;ent pur|&s;ues to get rid of the Chace, without being &s;o tired, as for her own Ea&s;e to fall into the Mouth of the Mungrel &s;he runs from. But the Hi&s;tory of Sir <HI>Taffety</HI> is as plea&s;ant as his Character.</P>
<P>It happened, that when he fir&s;t &s;et up for a Fortune-hunter, he cho&s;e <HI>Tunbridge</HI> for the Scene of Action; where were at that Time Two Si&s;ters upon the &s;ame De&s;ign. The Knight believed of Cour&s;e the Elder mu&s;t be the better Prize; and con&s;equently makes all his Sail that Way. Peo|ple that want Sen&s;e, do always in an egregious Manner want Mode&s;ty, which made our Hero triumph in making his Amour as publick as was po&s;&s;ible. The adored Lady was no le&s;s vain of his publick Addre&s;&s;es. An Attorney with one Cau&s;e is not half &s;o re&s;tle&s;s as a Wo|man with one Lover. Where-ever they met, they talked to each other aloud, cho&s;e each o|ther Partner at Balls, &s;aluted at the mo&s;t con|&s;picuous Parts of the Service at Church, and practi&s;ed in Honour of each other all the re|markable Particularities which are u&s;ual for Per&s;ons who admire one another, and are con|temptible to the re&s;t of the World. The&s;e Two Lovers &s;eem'd as much made for each other as <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> and all pronounced it a Match of Nature's own making; but the Night be|fore the Nuptials, (&s;o univer&s;ally approved) the younger Si&s;ter, envious of the good Fortune even of her Si&s;ter, who had been pre&s;ent at mo&s;t of their Interviews, and had an equal Ta&s;t for the Charms of a Fop (as there are a Set of Women made for that Order of Men); the younger, I &s;ay, unable to &s;ee &s;o rich a Prize pa&s;s by her, di&s;covered to Sir <HI>Taffety,</HI> that a Coquet Air, much Tongue, and Three Suits, was all the Portion of his Mi&s;tre&s;s. His Love vani&s;hed that Moment, him&s;elf and Equipage
<PB N="342" REF="359">
the next Morning. It is uncertain where the Lo|ver has been ever &s;ince engag'd; but certain it is, he has not appeared in his Character as a Fol|lower of Love and Fortune till he arrived at <HI>Ep|&s;om,</HI> where there is at pre&s;ent a young Lady of Youth, Beauty, and Fortune, who has alarmed all the Vain and the Impertinent to infe&s;t that Quarter. At the Head of this A&s;&s;embly, Sir <HI>Taf|fety</HI> &s;hines in the brighte&s;t Manner, with all the Accompli&s;hments which u&s;ually en&s;uare the Heart of Woman; with this particular Merit, (which often is of great Service) that he is laughed at for her Sake. The Friends of the fair One are in much Pain for the Sufferings &s;he goes through from the Per&s;everance of this Hero; but they may be much more &s;o from the Danger of his &s;ucceeding, toward which they give him an helping Hand, if they di&s;&s;wade her with Bitter|ne&s;s; for there is a fanta&s;tical Genero&s;ity in the Sex, to approve Creatures of the lea&s;t Merit ima|ginable, when they &s;ee the Imperfections of their Admirers are become Marks of Deri&s;ion for their Sakes; and there is nothing &s;o frequent, as that he who was contemptible to a Woman in her own Judgment, has won her by being too violently oppo&s;ed by others.</P>

<P>In the &s;everal Capacities I bear, of A&s;trolo|ger, Civilian, and Phy&s;ician, I have with great Application &s;tudied the publick Emolument: To this End &s;erve all my Lucubrations, Specu|lations, and whatever other Labours I under|take, whether nocturnal or diurnal. On this Motive am I induced to publi&s;h a never-failing Medicine for the Spleen: My Experience in this Di&s;temper came from a very remarkable Cure on my ever worthy Friend <HI>Tom Spindle,</HI> who, through exce&s;&s;ive Gaiety, had exhau&s;ted
<PB N="343" REF="360">
that natural Stock of Wit and Spirits he had long been ble&s;&s;ed with: He was &s;unk and flattened to the lower Degree imaginable, &s;it|ting whole Hours over the <HI>Book of Martyrs,</HI> and <HI>Pilgrims Progre&s;s;</HI> his other Contempla|tions never ri&s;ing higher than the Colour of his Urine, or Regularity of his Pul&s;e. In this Condition I found him, accompanied by the learned Dr. <HI>Drachm,</HI> and a good old Nur&s;e. <HI>Drachm</HI> had pre&s;cribed Magazines of Herbs, and Mines of Steel. I &s;oon di&s;covered the Mala|dy, and de&s;canted on the Nature of it, till I con|vinced both the Patient and his Nur&s;e, that the Spleen is not to be cured by Medicine, but by Poetry. <HI>Apollo,</HI> the Author of Phy&s;ick, &s;hone with diffu&s;ive Rays the be&s;t of Poets as well as of Phy&s;icians; and it is in this double Capaci|ty that I have made my Way, and have found &s;weet, ea&s;y, flowring Numbers, are oft &s;uperior to our noble&s;t Medicines. When the Spirits are low, and Nature &s;unk, the Mu&s;e, with &s;pright|ly and harmonious Notes, gives an unexpected Turn with a Grain of Poetry, which I prepare without the U&s;e of Mercury. I have done Wonders in this Kind; for the Spleen is like the <HI>Tarantula,</HI> the Effects of who&s;e malignant Poi&s;on are to be prevented by no other Remedy but the Charms of Mu&s;ick: For you are to un|der&s;tand, that as &s;ome noxious Animals carry Antidotes for their own Poi&s;ons; &s;o there is &s;omething equally unaccountable in Poetry: For though it is &s;ometimes a Di&s;ea&s;e, it is to be cured only by it &s;elf. Now I knowing <HI>Tom Spindle</HI>'s Con&s;titution, and that he is not only a pretty Gentleman, but al&s;o a pretty Poet, found the true Cau&s;e of his Di&s;temper was a violent Grief that moved his Affections too &s;trongly: For during the late Treaty of Peace, he had writ a mo&s;t excellent Poem on that Subject;
<PB N="344" REF="361">
and when he wanted but Two Lines in the la&s;t Stanza for fini&s;hing the whole Piece, there comes News that the <HI>French</HI> Tyrant would not &s;ign. <HI>Spindle</HI> in a few Days took his Bed, and had lain there &s;till, had not I been &s;ent for. I immediately told him, there was great Probabi|lity the <HI>French</HI> would now &s;ue to us for Peace. I &s;aw immediately a new Life in his Eyes; and knew, That nothing could help him forward &s;o well, as hearing Ver&s;es which he would believe wor&s;e than his own; I read him therefore the <HI>Bru&s;&s;els Po&s;t&s;cript.</HI> After which I recited &s;ome Heroick Lines of my own, which operated &s;o &s;trongly on the Tympanum of his Ear, that I doubt not but I have kept out all other Sounds for a Fortnight; and have Rea&s;on to hope, we &s;hall &s;ee him abroad the Day before his Poem.</P>
<P>This you &s;ee, is a particular Secret I have found out, <HI>viz.</HI> That you are not to chu&s;e your Phy&s;ician for his Knowledge in your Di|&s;temper, but for having it him&s;elf. There|fore I am at Hand for all Maladies ari&s;ing from Poetical Vapours, beyond which I never pre|tend. For being called the other Day to one in Love, I took indeed their Three Guinea's, and gave them my Advice; which was, to &s;end for <HI>Ae&s;culapius. Ae&s;culapius,</HI> as &s;oon as he &s;aw the Patient, cries out, 'Tis Love! 'Tis Love! Oh! the unequal Pul&s;e! The&s;e are the Symp|toms a Lover feels; &s;uch Sighs, &s;uch Pangs, at|tend the unea&s;y Mind; nor can our Art, or all our boa&s;ted Skill, avail&mdash;Yet, O Fair! for thee&mdash;Thus the Sage ran on, and owned the Pa&s;&s;ion which he pitied, as well as that he felt a greater Pain than ever he cured: After which he concluded, All I can advi&s;e, is Marriage: Charms and Beauty will give new Life and Vigour, and turn the Cour&s;e of Nature to its better Pro&s;pect. This is the new Way; and
<PB N="345" REF="362">
thus <HI>Ae&s;culapius</HI> has left his beloved Powders, and writes a <HI>Recipe</HI> for a Wife at Sixty. In &s;hort, my Friend followed the Pre&s;cription, and married Youth and Beauty in its perfect Bloom.</P>
<Q><L>Supine in <HI>Silvia</HI>'s &s;nowy Arms he lies,</L>
<L>And all the bu&s;y Care of Life defies:</L>
<L>Each happy Hour is fill'd with fre&s;h Delight,</L>
<L>While Peace the Day, and Plea&s;ure crowns the Night.</L></Q>

<P>Tragical Pa&s;&s;ion was the Subject of the Di&s;|cour&s;e where I la&s;t vi&s;ited this Evening; and a Gentleman who knows that I am at pre&s;ent writing a very deep Tragedy, directed his Di&s;|cour&s;e in a particular Manner to me. It is the common Fault (&s;aid he) of you, Gentlemen, who write in the Buskin Style, that you give us ra|ther the Sentiments of &s;uch who behold Tragi|cal Events, than of &s;uch who bear a Part in 'em them&s;elves. I would advi&s;e all who pre|tend this Way, to read <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> with Care, and they will &s;oon be deterred from putting forth what is u&s;ually called Tragedy. The Way of common Writers in this Kind, is rather the <HI>De&s;cription</HI> than the <HI>Expre&s;&s;ion</HI> of Sorrow. There is no Medium in the&s;e Attempts; and you mu&s;t go to the very Bottom of the Heart, or it is all mere Language; and the Writer of &s;uch Lines is no more a Poet, than a Man is a Phy|&s;ician for knowing the Names of Di&s;tempers, without the Cau&s;es of them Men of Sen&s;e are profe&s;&s;ed Enemies to all &s;uch empty Labours: For he who p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">etends to be &s;orrowful, and is not, is a Wretch yet more contemptible than he who pretends to be me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ry, and is not. Such a Tragedian is only maudlin drunk. The
<PB N="346" REF="363">
Gentleman went on with much Warmth; but all he could &s;ay had little Effect upon me: But when I came hither, I &s;o far ob&s;erved his Coun|&s;el, that I looked into <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI> The Tragedy I dipped into was, <HI>Harry the Fourth.</HI> In the Scene where <HI>Morton</HI> is preparing to tell <HI>Northumber|land</HI> of his Son's Death; the old Man does not give him Time to &s;peak, but &s;ays,<Q><L>The Whitene&s;s of thy Cheeks</L>
<L>Is apter than thy Tongue to tell thy Errand;</L>
<L>Even &s;uch a Man, &s;o faint, &s;o &s;piritle&s;s,</L>
<L>So dull, &s;o dead in Look, &s;o Woe&mdash;Be gone.</L>
<L>Drew <HI>Priam</HI>'s Curtain at the Dead of Night,</L>
<L>And would have told him Half his <HI>Troy</HI> was burnt</L>
<L>But <HI>Priam</HI> found the Fire, e're he his Tongue,</L>
<L>And I my <HI>Percy</HI>'s Death e're thou report'&s;t it.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Image in this Place is wonderfully noble and great; yet this Man in all this is but ri|&s;ing towards his great Affliction, and is &s;till e|nough him&s;elf, as you &s;ee, to make a Simile? But when he is certain of his Son's Death, he is lo&s;t to all Patience, and gives up all the Re|gards of this Life; and &s;ince the la&s;t of Evils is fallen upon him, he calls for it upon all the World.</P>
<Q><L>Now let not Nature's Hand</L>
<L>Keep the wild <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lood confined; let Order die,</L>

Reading but this one Scene has convinced me, that he who de&s;cribes the Concern of great Men, mu&s;t have a Soul as noble, and as &s;u&s;ceptible of high Thoughts, as they whom he repre&s;ents: I &s;hall therefore lay by my <HI>Drama</HI> for &s;ome Time, and turn my Thoughts to Cares and Griefs, &s;ome|what below that of Heroes, but no le&s;s moving.

We cho&s;e to take our Walk on <HI>Tower Hill;</HI> and as we were coming from thence in o der to &s;troll as far as <HI>Garraway</HI>'s, I ob&s;e ved two Men, who had but ju&s;t landed, coming from the Water|&s;ide. I thought there was &s;omething uncom|mon
<PB N="348" REF="365">
in their Mien and A&s;pect; but though they &s;eemed by their Vi&s;age to be related, yet, was there a Warmth in their Manner, as if they differed very much in their Sentiments of the Subject on which they were talking. One of them &s;eem'd to have a natural Confidence, mixed with an ingenuous Freedom in his Ge|&s;ture, his Dre&s;s very plain, but very graceful and becoming: The other, in the mid&s;t of an over-bearing Carriage, betrayed (by frequently looking round him) a Su&s;picion that he was not enough regarded by tho&s;e he met, or that he feared they would make &s;ome Attack upon him. This Per&s;on was much taller than his Companion, and added to that Height the Ad|vantage of a Feather in his Hat, and Heels to his Shoes &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly high, that he had Three or Four Times fallen down, had he not been &s;upported by his Friend. They made a full Stop as they came within a few Yards of the Place where we &s;tood. The plain Gentle|man bowed to <HI>Pacolet;</HI> the other looked on him with &s;ome Di&s;plea&s;ure: Upon which I asked him, Who they both were? When he thus informed me of their Per&s;ons and Circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>You may remember, <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> that I have of|ten told you, there are Beings of a &s;uperior Rank to Mankind, who frequently vi&s;it the Ha|bitations of Men, in order to call them from &s;ome wrong Pur&s;uits in which they are actually engaged, or divert them from Methods which will lead them into Errors for the future. He that will carefully reflect upon the Occurrences of his Life, will find he has been &s;ometimes extricated out of Difficulties, and received Fa|vours where he could never have expected &s;uch Benefits; as well as met with cro&s;s Events from &s;ome un&s;een Hand, which have di&s;ap|pointed
<PB N="349" REF="366">
his be&s;t laid De&s;igns. Such Accidents arrive from the Interventions of Aerial Beings, as they are benevolent or hurtful to the Nature of Man, and attend his Steps in the Tracts of Ambition, of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and of Plea&s;ure. Be|fore I ever appeared to you in the Manner I do now, I have frequently followed you in your Evening Walks, and have often, by throwing &s;ome Accident in your Way, as the pa&s;&s;ing by of a Funeral, or the Appearance of &s;ome other &s;olemn Object, given your Imagination a new Turn, and changed a Night you had de&s;tined to Mirth and Jollity, into an Exerci&s;e of Study and Contemplation. I was the old Soldier who met you la&s;t Summer in <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI>-Fields, and pre|tended that I had broken my Wooden-Leg, and could not get Home; but I &s;nap'd it &s;hort off on purpo&s;e, that you might fall into the Reflections you did on that Subject, and take me into your Hack. If you remember, you made your &s;elf very merry on that Fracture, and asked me, Whether I thought I &s;hould next Winter feel Cold in the Toes of that Leg? As is u&s;ually ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e who lo&s;e Limbs, are &s;en|&s;ible of Pains in the extreme Parts, even after tho&s;e Limbs are cut off. However, my keep|ing you then in the Story of the Battle of the <HI>Boin,</HI> prevented an A&s;&s;ignation, which would have led you into more Di&s;a&s;ters than I then re|lated.</P>
<P>To be &s;hort: Tho&s;e Two Per&s;ons you &s;ee yonder, are &s;uch as I am; they are not real Men, but are mere Shades and Figures: One is named <HI>Alethes,</HI> the other <HI>Veri&s;imilis.</HI> Their Office is to be the Guardians and Repre&s;enta|tives of <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> and <HI>Honour.</HI> They are now going to vi&s;it the &s;everal Parts of the Town, to &s;ee how their Intere&s;ts in the World decay or flouri&s;h, and to purge them&s;elves from the
<PB N="350" REF="367">
many fal&s;e Imputations they daily meet with in the Commerce and Conver&s;ation of Men. You ob&s;erved <HI>Veri&s;imilis</HI> frowned when he fir&s;t &s;aw me. What he is provoked at, is, that I told him one Day, though he &s;trutted and dre&s;&s;ed with &s;o much O&s;tentation, if he kept him&s;elf within his own Bounds, he was but a Lacquey, and wore only that Gentleman's Li|very whom he is now with. This frets him to the Heart; for you mu&s;t know, he has pre|tended a long Time to &s;et up for him&s;elf, and gets among a Crowd of the more unthinking Part of Mankind, who take him for a Per&s;on of the Fir&s;t Quality; though his Introduction into the World was wholly owing to his pre&s;ent Companion.</P>
<P>This Encounter was very agreeable to me, and I was re&s;olved to dog them, and de&s;ired <HI>Pacolet</HI> to accompany me. I &s;oon perceived what he told me in the Ge&s;ture of the Per&s;ons: For when they look'd at each other in Di&s;|cour&s;e, the well-dre&s;s'd Man &s;uddenly ca&s;t down his Eyes, and di&s;covered that the other had a painful Superiority over him. After &s;ome further Di&s;cour&s;e, they took Leave. The plain Gentleman went down towards <HI>Thames-&s;treet,</HI> in order to be pre&s;ent, at lea&s;t, at the Oaths taken at the <HI>Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e;</HI> and the other made directly for the Heart of the City. It is incredible how great a Change there imme|diately appeared in the Man of Honour when he got rid of his unea&s;ie Companion: He ad|ju&s;ted the Cock of his Hat a-new, &s;ettled his Sword-Knot, and had an Appearance that at|tracted a &s;udden Inclination for him and his Intere&s;ts in all who beheld him. For my Part (&s;aid I to <HI>Pacolet</HI>) I cannot but think you are mi&s;taken in calling this Per&s;on, of the Lower Quality; for he looks much more like a Gen|tleman
<PB N="351" REF="368">
than the other. Don't you ob&s;erve all Eyes are upon him as he advances: How each Sex gazes at his Stature, A&s;pect, Addre&s;s, and Motion? <HI>Pacolet</HI> only &s;miled, and &s;haked his Head; as leaving me to be convinced by my own further Ob&s;ervation. We kept on our Way after him till we came to <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> where the plain Gentleman again came up to the other; and they &s;tood together after the Manner of eminent Merchants, as if ready to receive Application; but I could ob&s;erve no Man talk to either of them. The One was laughed at as a Fop; and I heard many Whi&s;|pers again&s;t the other, as a whim&s;ical Sort of Fellow, and a great Enemy to Trade. They cro&s;&s;ed <HI>Cornhill</HI> together, and came into the full <HI>Change,</HI> where &s;ome bowed, and gave them&s;elves Airs in being known to &s;o fine a Man as <HI>Veri&s;imilis,</HI> who, they &s;aid, had great Intere&s;t in all Princes Courts; and the other was taken Notice of by &s;everal as one they had &s;een &s;omewhere long before. One more particularly &s;aid, He had formerly been a Man of Con&s;ideration in the World; but was &s;o un|lucky, that they who dealt with him, by &s;ome &s;trange Infatuation or other, had a Way of cut|ting off their own Bills, and were prodigi|ou&s;ly &s;low in improving their Stock. But as much as I was curious to ob&s;erve the Reception the&s;e Gentlemen met with upon <HI>Change,</HI> I could not help being interrupted by one that came up towards us, to whom every Body made their Compliments. He was of the com|mon Height, and in his Dre&s;s there &s;eemed to be great Care to appear no Way particular, ex|cept in a certain exact and feat Manner of Be|haviour and Circum&s;pection. He was won|derfully careful that his Shoes and Cloathes &s;hould be without the lea&s;t Speck upon them;
<PB N="352" REF="369">
and &s;eem'd to think, that on &s;uch an Ac|cident depended his very Life and Fortune. There was hardly a Man on <HI>Change</HI> who had not a Note upon him; and each &s;eem'd very well &s;atisfied that their Money lay in his Hands, without demanding Payment. I asked <HI>Pacolet,</HI> What great Merchant that was, who was &s;o univer&s;ally addre&s;&s;ed to, yet made too familiar an Appearance to command that extraordinary Deference? <HI>Pacolet</HI> an&s;wer'd, This Per&s;on is the Daemon or Genius of Credit; his Name is <HI>Umbra.</HI> If you ob&s;erve, he follows <HI>Alethes</HI> and <HI>Veri&s;imilis</HI> at a Di&s;tance; and indeed has no Foundation for the Figure he makes in the World, but that he is thought to keep their Ca&s;h; though at the &s;ame Time, none who tru&s;t him, would tru&s;t the other for a Groat. As the Company rolled about, the Three Spe|cters were jumbled into one Place: When they were &s;o, and all thought there was an Alliance between them, they immediately drew upon them the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the whole <HI>Change.</HI> But their Affairs &s;oon encrea&s;ed to &s;uch an unweildy Bulk, that <HI>Alethes</HI> took his Leave, and &s;aid, He would not engage further than he had an immediate Fund to an&s;wer. <HI>Veri&s;imilis</HI> pretend|ed, that though he had Revenues large enough to go on his own Bottom, yet it was below one of his Family to conde&s;cend to trade in his own Name; therefore he al&s;o retired. I was extremely troubled, to &s;ee the glorious Mart of <HI>London</HI> left with no other Guardian, but him of Credit. But <HI>Pacolet</HI> told me, That Traders had nothing to do with the <HI>Honour</HI> or <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> of their Corre&s;pondents, provided they &s;uppor|ted a general Behaviour in the World, which could not hurt their Credit or their Pur&s;es: For (&s;aid he) you may in this one Tract of Building of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> &s;ee the imaginary
<PB N="353" REF="370">
Motives on which the greate&s;t Affairs move, as well as in rambling over the Face of the Earth. For tho' <HI>Alethes</HI> is the real Governour, as well as Legi&s;lator of Mankind, he has very little Bu|&s;ine&s;s but to make up Quarrels, and is only a ge|neral Referree, to whom every Man pretends to appeal; but is &s;atisfied with his Determina|tions no further than they promote his own In|tere&s;t. Hence it is, that the Soldier and the Courtier model their Actions according to <HI>Veri|&s;imilis</HI>'s Manner, and the Merchant according to that of <HI>Umbra.</HI> Among the&s;e Men, Honour and Credit are not valuable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in them|&s;elves, or pur&s;ued out of a Principle of Ju&s;tice; but merely as they are &s;erviceable to Ambition and to Commerce. But the World will never be in any Manner of Order or Tranquility, till Men are firmly convinced, that Con&s;cience, Ho|nour, and Credit, are all in one Intere&s;t; and that without the Concurrence of the former, the latter are but Impo&s;itions upon our &s;elves and others. The Force the&s;e delu&s;ive Words have, is not &s;een in the Tran&s;actions of the bu&s;ie World only, but al&s;o have their Tyranny over the Fair Sex. Were you to ask the un|happy <HI>Lais,</HI> What Pangs of Reflection, prefer|ring the Con&s;ideration of her Honour to her Con&s;cience, has given her? She could tell you, That it has forced her to drink up half a Gal|lon this Winter of <HI>Tom Da&s;&s;apas</HI>'s Potions; That &s;he &s;till pines away for fear of being a Mother; and knows not, but the Moment &s;he is &s;uch, &s;he &s;hall be a Murdere&s;s: But if Con|&s;cience had as &s;trong a Force upon her Mind as Honour, the fir&s;t Step to her unhappy Con|dition had never been made; &s;he had &s;till been innocent, as &s;he's beautiful. Were Men &s;o enlighten'd and &s;tudious of their own Good, as to act by the Dictates of their Rea&s;on and
<PB N="354" REF="371">
Reflection, and not the Opinion of others, Con|&s;cience would be the &s;teady Ruler of humane Life; and the Words, <HI>Truth, Law, Rea&s;on, Equi|ty,</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> would be but Synonymous Terms, for that only Guide which makes us pa&s;s our Days in our own Favour and Approba|tion.</P>

<P>THE Impo ition of hone&s;t Names and Words upon improper Subjects, has made &s;o regu|lar a Confu&s;ion among&s;t us, that we are apt to &s;it down with our Errors, well enough &s;atisfied with the Methods we are fallen into, without at|tempting to deliver ou &s;elves from the Tyranny under which we are reduc'd by &s;uch Innovations. Of all the laudable Motives of humane Life, none has &s;uffered &s;o much in this Kind, as Love; under which rever'd Name, a brutal De&s;ire call'd Lu&s;t is frequently concealed and admitted; tho' they differ as much as a Matron from a Pro&s;ti|ture, or a Companion from a Buffoon. <HI>Philan|der</HI> the other Day was bewailing this Misfortune w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> much Indignation, and upbraided me for hav <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">g &s;ome Time &s;ince quoted tho&s;e excellent Lines of the Satyri&s;t:<Q><L>To an exact Perfection they have brought</L>
<L>The Action Love, the Pa&s;&s;ion is forgot.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="372">
How could you (&s;aid he) leave &s;uch a Hint &s;o coldly? How could <HI>A&s;pa&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Semphronia</HI> en|ter into your Imagination at the &s;ame Time, and you never declare to us the different Reception you gave 'em?</P>
<P>The Figures which the ancient Mythologi&s;ts and Poets put upon Love and Lu&s;t in their Wri|tings, are very in&s;tructive. Love is a beauteous Blind Child, adorn'd with a Quiver and a Bow, which he plays with, and &s;hoots around him, without De&s;ign or Direction; to intimate to us, that the Per&s;on beloved has no Intention to give us the Anxieties we meet with; but that the Beauties of a worthy Object are like the Charms of a lovely Infant: They cannot but attract your Concern and Fondne&s;s, tho' the Child &s;o regard|ed is as in&s;en&s;ible of the Value you put upon it, as it is that it de&s;erves your Benevolence. On the other Side, the Sages figured Lu&s;t in the Form of a Satyr; of Shape, part Humane, part Be&s;tial; to &s;ignify, that the Followers of it pro|&s;titute the Rea&s;on of a Man to pur&s;ue the Appe|tites of a Bea&s;t. This Satyr is made to haunt the Paths and Coverts of the Wood-Nymphs and Shepherde&s;&s;es, to lurk on the Banks of Rivulets, and watch the purling Streams, (as the Re&s;orts of retired Virgins) to &s;how, that lawle&s;s De&s;ire tends chiefly to prey upon Innocence, and has &s;omething &s;o unnatural in it, that it hates its own Make, and &s;huns the Object it lov'd, as &s;oon as it has made it like it &s;elf. Love therefore is a Child that complains and bewails its Inability to help it &s;elf, and weeps for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, without an immediate Reflection or Knowledge of the Food it wants: Lu&s;t, a watchful Thief which &s;eizes its Prey, and lays Snares for its own Relief; and its principal Object being Innocence, it never robs, but it murders at the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="373">
From this Idea of a <HI>Cupid</HI> and a <HI>Satyr,</HI> we may &s;ettle our Notion of the&s;e different De&s;ires, and accordingly rank their Followers. <HI>A&s;pa&s;ia</HI> mu&s;t therefore be allow'd to be the fir&s;t of the beau|teous Order of Love, who&s;e unaffected Freedom, and con&s;cious Innocence, give her the Attendance of the Graces in all her Actions. That awful Di|&s;tance which we bear towards her in all our Thoughts of her, and that chearful Familiarity with which we approach her, are certain In&s;tan|ces of her being the true&s;t Object of Love of any of her Sex. In this accompli&s;h'd Lady, Love is the con&s;tant Effect, becau&s;e it is never the De|&s;ign. Yet, tho' her Mien carries much more Invi|tation than Command, to behold her is an im|mediate Check to loo&s;e Behaviour; and to love her, is a liberal Education: For, it being the Na|ture of all Love to create an Imitation of the be|loved Per&s;on in the Lover, a Regard for <HI>A&s;pa&s;ia</HI> naturally produces Decency of Manners, and good Conduct of Life in her Admirers. If there|fore the giggling <HI>Leucippe</HI> could but &s;ee her Train of Fops a&s;&s;embled, and <HI>A&s;pa&s;ia</HI> move by 'em, &s;he would be mortified at the Veneration with which &s;he is beheld, ev'n by <HI>Leucippe</HI>'s own un|thinking Equipage, who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions have long ta|ken Leave of their Under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>As Charity is e&s;teemed a Conjunction of the good Qualities nece&s;&s;ary to a virtuous Man, &s;o Love is the happy Compo&s;ition of all the Accom|pli&s;hments that make a Fine Gentleman. The Motive of a Man's Life is &s;een in all his Actions; and &s;uch as have the Beauteous Boy for their In&s;pirer, have a Simplicity of Behaviour, and a certain Evenne&s;s of De&s;ire, which burns like the Lamp of Life in their Bo&s;oms; while they who are in&s;tigated by the Satyr, are ever tortu|red by Jealou&s;ies of the Object of their Wi&s;hes; often de&s;ire what they &s;corn, and as often
<PB N="357" REF="374">
con&s;ciou&s;ly and knowingly embrace where they are mutually indifferent.</P>
<P><HI>Florio,</HI> the generous Husband, and <HI>Limberham,</HI> the kind Keeper, are noted Examples of the dif|ferent Effects which the&s;e De&s;ires produce in the Mind. <HI>Amanda,</HI> who is the Wife of <HI>Florio,</HI> lives in the continual Enjoyment of new In&s;tances of her Husband's Friend&s;hip, and &s;ees it the End of all his Ambition to make her Life one Series of Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction; and <HI>Amanda</HI>'s Reli&s;h of the Goods of Life, is all that makes 'em plea|&s;ing to <HI>Florio:</HI> They behave them&s;elves to each other when pre&s;ent with a certain apparent Bene|volence, which tran&s;ports above Rapture; and they think of each other in Ab&s;ence with a Con|fidence unknown to the highe&s;t Friend&s;hip: Their Satisfactions are doubled, their Sorrows le&s;&s;en'd by Participation.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, <HI>Corinna,</HI> who is the Mi&s;tre&s;s of <HI>Limberham,</HI> lives in con&s;tant Tor|ment: Her Equipage is, an old Woman, who was what <HI>Corinna</HI> is now; an antiquated Foot|man, who was Pimp to <HI>Limberham</HI>'s Father; and a Chamber-Maid, who is <HI>Limberham</HI>'s Wench by Fits, out of a Principle of Politicks to make her jealous and watchful of <HI>Corinna.</HI> Under this Guard, and in this Conver&s;ation, <HI>Corinna</HI> lives in State: The Furniture of her Habitation, and her own gorgeous Dre&s;s, make her the Envy of all the &s;trolling Ladies in the Town; but <HI>Corinna</HI> know &s;he her &s;elf is but Part of <HI>Limberham</HI>'s Hou&s;hold-Stuff, and is as capa|ble of being di&s;pos'd of el&s;ewhere, as any other Moveable. But while her Keeper is per&s;waded by his Spies, that no Enemy has been within his Doors &s;ince his la&s;t Vi&s;it, no <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Prince was ever &s;o magnificently bountiful: A kind Look or falling Tear is worth a Piece of Broc|kade, a Sigh is a Jewel, and a Smile is a Cup|board
<PB N="358" REF="375">
board of Plate. All this is &s;har'd between <HI>Co|rinna</HI> and her Guard in his Ab&s;ence. With this great Oeconomy and Indu&s;try does the unhappy <HI>Limberham</HI> purcha&s;e the con&s;tant Tortures of Jea|lou&s;ie, the Favour of &s;pending his E&s;tate, and the Opportunity of enriching one by whom he knows he is hated and de&s;pi&s;ed. The&s;e are the ordinary and common Evils which attend Keepers, and <HI>Corinna</HI> is a Wench but of common Size of Wickedne&s;s, were you to know what pa&s;&s;es un|der the Roof where the fair <HI>Me&s;&s;alina</HI> reigns with her humble Adorer!</P>
<P><HI>Me&s;&s;alina</HI> is the profe&s;s'd Mi&s;tre&s;s of Mankind; &s;he has left the Bed of her Husband and her beauteous Offspring, to give a Loo&s;e to Want of Shame and Fulne&s;s of De&s;ire. Wretched <HI>Nocturuus,</HI> her feeble Keeper! How the poor Creature fribles in his Gate, and skuttles from Place to Place to di&s;patch his nece&s;&s;ary Affairs in painful Day-light, that he may return to the con&s;tant Twilight pre&s;erv'd in that Scene of Wantonne&s;s, <HI>Me&s;&s;alina</HI>'s Bed-chamber! How does he, while he is ab&s;ent from thence, con&s;i|der in his Imagination the Breadth of his Por|ter's Shoulders, the &s;pruce Nightcap of his Va|let, the ready Attendance of his Butler! Any of all whom he knows &s;he admits, and profe&s;|&s;es to approve of. This, alas! is the Gallantry; this the Freedom of our Fine Gentlemen: For this they pre&s;erve their Liberty, and keep clear of that Bugbear, Marriage. But he does not under&s;tand either Vice or Virtue, who will not allow, that Life without the Rules of Morality is a wayward unea&s;ie Being, with Snatches only of Plea&s;ure; but under the Regulation of Vir|tue, a rea&s;onable and uniform Habit of Enjoy|ment. I have &s;een in a Play of old <HI>Haywood</HI>'s, a Speech at the End of an Act, which touch'd this Point with much Spirit. He makes a married
<PB N="359" REF="376">
Man in the Play, upon &s;ome endearing Occa&s;ion, look at his Spou&s;e with an Air of Fondne&s;s, and fall into the following Reflection on his Condition:</P>
<Q><L>Oh Marriage! Happie&s;t, ea&s;ie&s;t, &s;afe&s;t State;</L>
<L>Let Debauchees and Drunkards &s;corn thy Rights,</L>
<L>Who, in their nau&s;eous Draughts and Lu&s;ts, profane</L>
<L>Both thee and Heav'n by whom thou wer't or|dain'd.</L>
<L>How can the Savage call it Lo&s;s of Freedom,</L>
<L>Thus to conver&s;e with, thus to gaze at</L>
<L>A faithful, beauteous Friend?</L>
<L>Blu&s;h not, my fair One, that thy Love applauds thee,</L>
<L>Nor be it painful to my wedded Wife,</L>
<L>That my full Heart o'erflows in Prai&s;e of thee.</L>
<L>Thou art by Law, by Intere&s;t, Pa&s;&s;ion, mine:</L>
<L>Pa&s;&s;ion and Rea&s;on join in Love of thee.</L>
<L>Thus, through a World of Calumny and Fraud,</L>
<L>We pa&s;s both unreproach'd, both undeceiv'd;</L>
<L>While in each other's Intere&s;t and Happine&s;s,</L>

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of <HI>Orlando</HI> the Fair. <HI>Chap. I.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHatever malicious Men may &s;ay of our Lu|cubrations, we have no De&s;ign but to produce unknown Merit, or place in a proper Light the Actions of our Contemporaries who labour to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, whether it be by Vice or Virtue. For we &s;hall never give Accounts to the World of any Thing, but what the Lives and Endeavours of the Per&s;ons (of whom we treat) make the Ba&s;is of their Fame and Repu+tation. For this Rea&s;on it is to be hoped, that our Appearance is reputed a publick Benefit; and tho' certain Per&s;ons may turn what we mean for Panegyrick into Scandal, let it be an&s;wered once for all, That if our Prai&s;es are really de|&s;ign'd as Raillery, &s;uch malevolent Per&s;ons owe their Safety from it only to their being too in|con&s;iderable for Hi&s;tory. It is not every Man who deals in Ratsbane, or is un&s;ea&s;onably amo|rous, that can adorn Story like <HI>Ae&s;culapius;</HI> nor every Stock-Jobber of the <HI>India</HI> Company can a&s;&s;ume the Port, and per&s;onate the Figure of <HI>Aurengezebe.</HI> My noble Ance&s;tor Mr. <HI>Shake|&s;pear,</HI> who was of the Race of the <HI>Staffs,</HI> was not more fond of the memorable Sir <HI>John Fal|&s;taff,</HI> than I am of tho&s;e Worthies; but the <HI>La|tins</HI> have an admirable Admonition expre&s;s'd in two Words, to wit, <HI>Nequid nimis,</HI> which for|bids my indulging my &s;elf on tho&s;e delightful

Subjects, and calls me to do Ju&s;tice to others, who make no le&s;s Figures in our Generation. Of &s;uch, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t renown'd is, that eminent Hero and Lover, <HI>Orlando</HI> the Hand&s;ome, who&s;e Di&s;appointments in Love, in Gallantry, and in War, have bani&s;hed him from publick View, and made him voluntarily enter into a Confinement, to which the ungrateful Age would otherwi&s;e have forced him. Ten <HI>Lu&s;tra</HI> and more are wholly pa&s;s'd &s;ince <HI>Orlando</HI> fir&s;t appeared in the Metropolis of this I&s;land: His De&s;cent noble, his Wit humorous, his Per&s;on charming. But to none of the&s;e Recommenda|tory Advantages was his Title &s;o undoubted as that of his Beauty. His Complexion was fair, but his Countenance manly; his Stature of the talle&s;t, his Shape the mo&s;t exact; and tho' in all his Limbs he had a Proportion as delicate as we &s;ee in the Works of the mo&s;t skilful Statua|ries, his Body had a Strength and Firmne&s;s little inferior to the Marble of which &s;uch Images are form'd. This made <HI>Orlando</HI> the univer&s;al Flame of all the Fair Sex; Innocent Virgins &s;igh'd for him, as <HI>Adonis;</HI> experienced Widows, as <HI>Her|cules.</HI> Thus did this Figure walk alone the Pat|tern and Ornament of our <HI>Species,</HI> but of Cour&s;e the Envy of all who had the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ions, without his &s;uperior Merit and Pretences to the Favour of that enchanting Creature, <HI>Woman.</HI> However, the generous <HI>Orlando</HI> believ'd him&s;elf form'd for the World, and not to be engro&s;s'd by any particular Affection. He &s;igh'd not for <HI>Delia,</HI> for <HI>Chloris,</HI> for <HI>Chloe,</HI> for <HI>Betty,</HI> nor my Lady, nor for the ready Chamber-maid, nor di|&s;tant Barone&s;s: <HI>Woman</HI> was his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and the whole Sex his Seraglio. His Form was al|ways irre&s;i&s;tible: And if we con&s;ider, that not One of Five hundred can bear the lea&s;t Favour from a Lady without being exalted above him|&s;elf;
<PB N="363" REF="380">
if al&s;o we mu&s;t allow, that a Smile from a Side-Box has made <HI>Jack Spruce</HI> half mad, we can't think it wonderful that <HI>Orlando</HI>'s repeated Conque&s;ts touch'd his Brain: So it certainly did, and <HI>Orlando</HI> became an Enthu&s;ia&s;t in Love; and in all his Addre&s;s, contracted &s;omething out of the ordinary Cour&s;e of Breeding and Ci|vility. However, (powerful as he was) he would &s;till add to the Advantages of his Per&s;on, that of a Profe&s;&s;ion which the Ladies always fa|vour, and immediately commenced Soldier. Thus equipp'd for Love and Honour, our Hero &s;eeks di&s;tant Climes and Adventures, and leaves the de&s;pairing Nymphs of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to the Court&s;hip of Beaus and Witlings till his Re|turn. His Exploits in Foreign Nations and Courts, have not been regularly enough com|municated unto us, to report 'em with that Ve|racity which we profe&s;s in our Narrations: But after many Feats of Arms, (which tho&s;e who were Witne&s;&s;es to them have &s;uppre&s;s'd out of Envy, but which we have had faithfully related from his own Mouth in our publick Streets) <HI>Orlando</HI> returns home full, but not loaded with Years. Beaus born in his Ab&s;ence made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to decry his Furniture, his Dre&s;s, his Manner; but all &s;uch Rivalry he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed (as the Philo&s;opher did the Sceptick, who ar|gued there was no &s;uch Thing as Motion) by only moving. The Beauteous <HI>Villar J.</HI> who only was formed for his Paramour, became the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of his Affection. His fir&s;t Speech to he was as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>Madam,</HI> It is not only that Nature has made us Two the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of each Sex, and minted to us to obey her Dictates in becoming One; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> there is al&s;o an Ambition in following the mighty Per&s;ons you have favoured.

<P>Fortune having now &s;upplied <HI>Orlando</HI> with Ne|ce&s;&s;aries for his high Ta&s;te of Gallantry and Plea|&s;ure, his Equipage and Oeconomy had &s;ome|thing in them more &s;umptuous and gallant than could be receiv'd in our degenerate Age; there|fore his Figure (tho' highly graceful) appeared &s;o exotick, that it a&s;&s;embled all the <HI>Britons</HI> un|der the Age of Sixteen, who &s;aw his Grandeur to follow his Chariot with Shouts and Acclama|tions, which he regarded with the Contempt which great Minds affect in the mid&s;t of Applau|&s;es.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving a great deal of more advantagious Bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent on my Hands, I thought to have deferr'd an&s;wering your <HI>Tatler</HI> of the 21&s;t In&s;tant, till the Company was gone, and Sea&s;on over; but having re&s;olved not to re|gard any Impertinences of your Paper, except what relate particularly to me, I am the more ea&s;ily induc'd to an&s;wer you (as I &s;hall find Time to do it): Fir&s;t, pa tly le&s;t you &s;hould think your &s;elf neglected, which I have Rea&s;on to believe you would take heinou&s;ly ill. Se|condly, partly becau&s;e it will increa&s;e my Fame, and con&s;equently my Audience, when all the Quality &s;hall &s;ee with how much Wit and Rail|lery I &s;how you&mdash;I don't care a Farthing for you. Thirdly, partly becau&s;e being <HI>without Books,</HI> if I don't &s;how much Learning, it will not be imputed to my having none.</P>
<P>I have travelled <HI>Italy, France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and fully comprehend whatever any <HI>German</HI> Arri&s;t in the World can do; yet cannot I ima|gine, why you &s;hould endeavour to di&s;turb the Repo&s;e and Plenty which (tho' unworthy) I enjoy at this Place. It cannot be, that you take Offence at my Prologues and Epilogues, which you are pleas'd to mi&s;call Fooli&s;h and
<PB N="366" REF="383">
Abu&s;ive. No, no, until you give a better, I &s;hall not forbear thinking, that the true Rea|&s;on of your picking a Quarrel with me was, becau&s;e it is more agreeable to your Prin|ciples, as well as more to the Honour of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ured Victory, to attack a Governour. Mr. <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> Mr. <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> I can &s;ee into a Mill-&s;tone as far as another (as the Saying is). You <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> for &s;owing the Seeds of Sedition and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">bedience among my Puppets, and your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">eal for the (good old) Cau&s;e would make you per&s;wade <HI>Punch</HI> to pull the String from his Chops, and not move his Jaw when I have a Mind he &s;hould harangue. Now I appeal to all Men, if this is not contrary to that uncontroulable, unaccountable Dominion, which by the Laws of Nature I exerci&s;e over them; for all Sorts of Wood and Wire were made for the U&s;e and Benefit of Man: I have therefore an unque&s;tionable Right to frame, fa&s;hion, and put them together, as I plea&s;e; and having made them what they are, my Puppets are my Property, and there|fore my Slaves: Nor is there in Nature any Thing more ju&s;t, than the Homage which is paid by a le&s;s to a more excellent Being: So that by the Right therefore of a &s;uperior Ge|nius, I am their &s;upreme Moderator, altho' you would in&s;inuate (agreeably to your level|ling Principles) that I am my &s;elf but a great Puppet, and can therefore have but a co-ordi|nate Juri&s;diction with them. I &s;uppo&s;e I have now &s;ufficiently made it appear, that I have a paternal Right to keep a Puppet-Show, and this Right I will maintain in my Prologues on all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>And therefore, if you write a Defence of your &s;elf again&s;t this my Self-Defence, I ad|moni&s;h you to keep within Bounds; for
<PB N="367" REF="384">
every Day will not be &s;o propitious to you as the 29th of <HI>April;</HI> and perhaps my Re&s;ent|ment may get the better of my Genero&s;ity, and I may no longer &s;corn to fight one who is not my Equal with unequal Weapons: There are &s;uch Things as <HI>Scandulums Magnatums;</HI> there|fore take Heed hereafter how you write &s;uch Things as I cannot ea&s;ily an&s;wer, for that will put me in a Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I order you to handle only the&s;e Two Pro|po&s;itions, to which our Di&s;pute may be redu|ced: The Fir&s;t, Whether I have not an Ab|&s;olute Power, whenever I plea&s;e, to light a Pipe with one of <HI>Punch</HI>'s Legs, or warm my Fingers with his whole Carca&s;s? The Second, Whether the Devil would not be in <HI>Punch,</HI> &s;hould he by Word or Deed oppo&s;e my Sove|reign Will and Plea&s;ure? And then, perhaps, I may (if I can find Lei&s;ure for it) give you the Trouble of a &s;econd Letter.</P>
<P>But if you intend to tell me of the Original of Puppet-Shows, and the &s;everal Changes and Revolutions that have happened in them, &s;ince <HI>The&s;pis,</HI> and I don't care who, that's <HI>Noli me tangere;</HI> I have &s;olemnly engaged to &s;ay nothing of what I can't approve. Or, if you talk of certain Contracts with the Mayor and Burge&s;&s;es, or Fees to the Con|&s;tables, for the Privilege of Acting, I will not write one &s;ingle Word about any &s;uch Matters; but &s;hall leave you to be mumbled by the learned and very ingenious Author of a late Book, who knows very well what's to be &s;aid and done in &s;uch Ca&s;es. He is now &s;huffling the Cards, and dealing to <HI>Timothy;</HI> but if he wins the Game; I will &s;end him to play at Backgammon with you; and then he will &s;atisfy you, that Deuce-Ace makes Five.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="385">
And &s;o, &s;ubmitting my &s;elf to be try'd by my Country, and allowing any Jury of 12 good Men, and true, to be that Country; not excepting any (unle&s;s Mr. <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff</HI>) to be of the Pannel, for you are neither good nor true; I bid you heartily farewel; and am,</P>
