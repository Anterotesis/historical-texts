<Q>Which things we &s;peak, not in the words, which man's wi&s;dom teacheth; but which the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth, comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN St. Paul planted the go&s;pel at Corinth, he found his de&s;igns chiefly oppo&s;ed by two kinds of people.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t were men of plea&s;ure. Corinth lay commodiou&s;ly for trade; and trade pro|duces riches; and it had been early ob&s;erved, that it was difficult for <HI>rich men to enter into the kingdom of heaven.</HI> They were more di&s;po&s;ed to the plea&s;ures, which riches furni&s;h; than to the comforts, which religion admini&s;ters: and even they, who had embraced chri&s;tianity, found much work for the apo&s;tle in keeping them pure from the contagion, that was &s;pread abroad.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="5">Be&s;ides the gay, and thoughtle&s;s, the apo&s;tle had another kind of people to contend with. The&s;e were philo&s;ophers: and tho they were a more re&s;pectable &s;et of men, than the other; they were, at the &s;ame time, perhaps more intractable. A &s;tate of learning is in it&s;elf no doubt, favourable to religion, at lea&s;t in a certain degree; and has ever been found &s;o: but the philo&s;opher him&s;elf has &s;ometimes too much wi&s;dom to be taught. The Corinthian philo&s;ophers certainly had; and were in general rather inclined to add &s;omething of their own to amend the go&s;pel; than to accept it in that &s;implicity, in which Paul preached it.</P>
<P>To the latter the text alludes. The&s;e philo&s;ophizing chri&s;tians (many of whom were probably teachers al&s;o) the apo&s;tle endeavours to recall to the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel. He &s;ets before them his own example. He came not, he tells them, <HI>with the excellency of &s;peech, or the inticing words of man's wi&s;dom.</HI> He knew nothing among them, but <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucified:</HI> adding, that he had never preached <HI>the words, which man's wi&s;dom teach|eth; but which the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth; com|paring &s;piritual things with &s;piritual.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="6">In this pa&s;&s;age the apo&s;tle gives us the only true rule of interpreting &s;cripture; which rule I &s;hall endeavour to illu&s;trate, by &s;hewing, <HI>How the apo&s;tles were directed by it;</HI> and <HI>How it &s;eems applicable to us.</HI> The text has, I know, been applied by &s;ome interpreters to <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> rather than <HI>things:</HI> but, I think, the whole context favours the &s;en&s;e, in which I take it,</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, the apo&s;tle tells us, he avoided <HI>the words, which man's wi&s;dom teach|eth.</HI>&mdash;In the apo&s;tle's days indeed man's wi&s;|dom had made only a little progre&s;s in the affairs of religion. We read of Hymeneus, Philetus, and a few others, who &s;eemed de&s;i|rous of being <HI>teachers, before they under&s;tood what they affirmed.</HI> But their number was &s;mall.</P>
<P>Man's wi&s;dom however was a kind of leaven, which made a rapid progre&s;s. We need only cur&s;orily examine eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory to &s;ee it's mi&s;chievous effects. There we find men running &s;uch lengths of folly, extravagance, wildne&s;s, and I may add, of wickedne&s;s, that we may well &s;uppo&s;e, it was in the &s;pirit of <HI>fore&s;ight,</HI> that the apo&s;tle puts us &s;o-much on
<PB N="10" REF="7">
our guard again&s;t man's wi&s;dom. Man's wi&s;|dom hath filled innumerable volumes: the purity of the go&s;pel is comprized in one.</P>
<P>In this ingrateful field we might wander long. The hi&s;tory of man's wi&s;dom is the hi&s;|tory of his opinions; and of the&s;e there is no end. Zeal, and indi&s;cretion; pride, and vani|ty; bad meanings, and good meanings, have all contributed to interpret what the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth by the words of man's wi&s;dom. In|&s;tead therefore of wandering in this wide wil|derne&s;s, let us fix our eyes on tho&s;e great land|marks, which the apo&s;tle has &s;et up to lead us &s;afely through it.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tles were immediately in&s;pired. They taught, as the Holy Gho&s;t in&s;tructed. Immediate in&s;piration, <HI>brought all things to their remembrance, whatever their ble&s;&s;ed Lord had taught them.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, it &s;hould &s;eem, that the in&s;piration of the apo&s;tles was re&s;tricted to what was <HI>new</HI> in the religion they taught&mdash;or if not wholly new, yet &s;o ob&s;curely &s;hadowed out in prophecies, and prophetic types, that it needed certainly a full explanation. The great truths, with regard to the redemption of the world&mdash;the interce&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t&mdash;the con|ditions
<PB N="11" REF="8">
of acceptance&mdash;the univer&s;ality of the chri&s;tian religion&mdash;the motives it holds out&mdash; the purity it hath introduced into morals&mdash;the certainty of a future &s;tate&mdash;and of a la&s;t judg|ment&mdash;were all, no doubt &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on the minds of the apo&s;tles, and properly opened by <HI>immediate in&s;piration.</HI> In any of the&s;e great truths mi&s;takes were dangerous&mdash;memory was frail&mdash;and there were yet no written re|cords.&mdash;At the &s;ame time &s;uch notices, as were already on the records of in&s;piration&mdash; tho&s;e divine truths contained in the books of the Old Te&s;tament&mdash;wanted no farther illu&s;tra|tion from the Holy Gho&s;t. Here nothing more &s;eems to have been nece&s;&s;ary, than the u&s;e of rea&s;on, and common &s;en&s;e. And thus the apo&s;tle di&s;tingui&s;hes between the things, which God had <HI>revealed by the &s;pirit;</HI> and the act of <HI>comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual.</HI> The one he calls <HI>declaring the te&s;timony of God:</HI> the other was plainly the exertion only of rea&s;on. Nothing more than the exertion of rea&s;on was nece&s;&s;ary to prove the connection between the Old Te&s;tament and the New&mdash;or to point out the completion of prophecies&mdash;or to &s;hew, how the types of the law were fulfilled. Of this mode of <HI>rea&s;oning</HI> we find abundant in&s;tan|ces
<PB N="12" REF="9">
among the &s;acred writers&mdash;in the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews e&s;pecially.</P>
<P>Thus then in&s;piration &s;eems to have been nece&s;&s;ary to direct the apo&s;tles in what was <HI>hitherto unknown:</HI> but human rea&s;on &s;eemed &s;ufficient to enable them to <HI>apply</HI> what had been <HI>already</HI> in&s;pired.</P>
<P>Let us then now &s;ee, how this rule, which guided the apo&s;tles, appears applicable to us&mdash; or in what way we are to <HI>&s;peak what the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth, comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual.</HI></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I think, it plainly appears, that we have no rea&s;on to expect immediate direction from <HI>what the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth.</HI> To wait for de&s;ultory illap&s;es of the &s;pirit to lead us into truth, &s;eems to have little countenance from &s;cripture; unle&s;s indeed we apply to our&s;elves &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages, as by the faire&s;t rules of interpre|tation can apply only to the apo&s;tles. And &s;urely the greate&s;t caution is nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ettling a point, which, if it be an error, tends to confirm all other errors. When a man rea&s;ons him&s;elf into a mi&s;take, he may rea&s;on him&s;elf out of it again. But when a man di&s;cards rea&s;on, and &s;ub&s;titutes in it's room a divine in&s;tructor, every enthu&s;ia&s;tic notion becomes then immedi|ately
<PB N="13" REF="10">
&s;tamped with the character of divine truth. The &s;trange effects of &s;uch wildne&s;s we have often &s;een: and are &s;ufficiently guarded again&s;t it by the apo&s;tle's rule.</P>
<P>As far indeed as a <HI>holy life</HI> is concerned, we are a&s;&s;ured every where in &s;cripture, that unle&s;s the endeavours of man are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Holy Spirit of God, which dwells within him, and to who&s;e divine admonitions he ought ever to li&s;ten, <HI>he can do nothing.</HI> Here the divine aid is nece&s;&s;ary. Man, as a <HI>moral agent,</HI> with all the mi&s;chiefs of the fall about him, want|ed &s;upport.</P>
<P>But the <HI>inve&s;tigation of truth</HI> is a different affair. It was not &s;o much his <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> that was di&s;turbed; as his <HI>will and affections,</HI> that were perverted. <HI>Wretched man,</HI> that he was, he knew what was right; but he could not practi&s;e it. To <HI>rectify his knowledge,</HI> enough had been done: in&s;pired truth was on record; and he had a rule given him to under&s;tand it. Farther aid would have rendered that rule un|nece&s;&s;ary; and the expectation of any &s;uch aid, enthu&s;ia&s;tic.</P>
<P>It is true indeed the pious Chri&s;tian will read his bible with the be&s;t effect: and in this &s;en&s;e, no doubt, the Holy Spirit may be
<PB N="14" REF="11">
&s;aid to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in under&s;tanding the truth of &s;cripture: for <HI>he who does the will of God, will know of the doctrine, whether it be of God.</HI> But this is &s;till only the application of &s;cripture to the rectifying of his <HI>affections.</HI> To under|&s;tand it as a <HI>&s;y&s;tem of truth,</HI> the rule given us <HI>to compare &s;piritual things with &s;piritual,</HI> &s;eems abundantly &s;ufficient. The New Te&s;tament is to us preci&s;ely in the &s;tate, in which the Old Te&s;tament was to the apo&s;tles. It is in&s;pi|ration recorded. If farther in&s;piration be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, a written record is more than is nece&s;|&s;ary. If God gave the greater, why &s;hould he give the le&s;s?&mdash;It &s;eems therefore fully &s;uffi|cient for the under&s;tanding of &s;cripture, to take it into our hands; and, in the &s;pirit of &s;inceri|ty, and piety, to compare one part with <HI>another;</HI> or with a <HI>general view</HI> of the whole. This &s;eems in the apo&s;tle's idea the only key to the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>But now, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that a va|riety of cau&s;es have introduced difficulties into the&s;e &s;acred records. Ancient cu&s;toms not well under&s;tood&mdash;ancient modes of &s;peaking, not conformable to our own&mdash;ancient errors, generated in times of ignorance&mdash;modern pre|judices, and opinions, grafted on texts of
<PB N="15" REF="12">
&s;cripture mi&s;applied&mdash;have united with other cau&s;es in disfiguring the plain, and &s;imple truths of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Why God &s;uffered this <HI>blot,</HI> as &s;ome may call it, in the &s;acred record of his truth, we know not. Yet humbly tracing the rea&s;on of it in the analogy of his other works, we may refer it to the general law of a &s;tate of trial. Every thing here bears the marks of the fall. In our moral pur&s;uits we are ex|erci&s;ed with various difficulties: why not in the pur&s;uit of religious truth? In both we may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, if we apply the proper means. In one, the &s;pirit of God will direct our en|deavours: in the other, the great &s;criptural rule of <HI>comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piri|tual.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>hone&s;t application</HI> of this rule, without doubt, would remove all the material difficul|ties of &s;cripture. But in&s;tead of &s;olving them in this way, we too often endeavour to adju&s;t them by the <HI>words of man's wi&s;dom.</HI> Hence ari&s;e all the di&s;putes, that have divided the church.</P>
<P>The opinions, which have occa&s;ioned them, however varied, run commonly in two great channels&mdash;that of enthu&s;ia&s;m, and that of
<PB N="16" REF="13">
libertini&s;m. The enthu&s;ia&s;t reads his bible too literally: the libertine, (I u&s;e the word in it's le&s;s offen&s;ive &s;en&s;e) too laxly. The one utterly di&s;cards rea&s;on: the other thinks no|nothing but rea&s;on worth attending to. The enthu&s;ia&s;t loves a my&s;tery, becau&s;e he does not under&s;tand it: the libertine allows nothing to be a my&s;tery; what he does not under|&s;tand, he rejects.&mdash;Let us in an in&s;tance or two, apply our great &s;criptural rule to them both.</P>
<P>With regard to the jarring doctrine of faith, and works, it can never &s;urely be &s;ettled by the literal application of a few &s;cattered pa&s;|&s;ages of St. Paul: but one &s;hould imagine it might ea&s;ily be &s;ettled by comparing &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages with <HI>other parts</HI> of &s;cripture; and &s;till more by an appeal to the <HI>whole &s;cheme of chri&s;|tianity.</HI> The very fir&s;t book of the bible &s;hews us, that the go&s;pel was meant to re&s;tore us to that purity of life, which we had origi|nally lo&s;t. This indeed &s;eems to be the leading point of chri&s;tianity; the word of God every where exhorting us to clean&s;e our hearts&mdash;to purify our affections&mdash;and to transform our|&s;elves into new creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="14">Now it is certain, all this mu&s;t be done by faith. <HI>Whoever cometh to God through Chri&s;t, mu&s;t believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them, who diligently &s;eek him.</HI> So that in this &s;en&s;e we may be &s;aid to be <HI>ju&s;tified by faith;</HI> becau&s;e without &s;aith, and it's accom|panying virtues, no man can attain that righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the go&s;pel requires as a proper qualification for our receiving the merits of Chri&s;t's death. All chri&s;tians therefore lay a &s;tre&s;s on faith. The great difference is, the <HI>partial</HI> view makes it in it&s;elf an <HI>end</HI>&mdash;the <HI>com|parative</HI> view makes it the <HI>means</HI> only of a purified heart, and a good life.</P>
<P>With regard again to an awful doctrine, which we have lately heard di&s;puted with &s;o much freedom; one &s;hould think, that a <HI>com|pari&s;on of &s;piritual things with &s;piritual</HI> might lead us here al&s;o to one point. The whole bible, Old Te&s;tament and New, prophecies, and completion, &s;eem &s;o full both of the hu|manity and divinity of Chri&s;t, that one &s;hould wonder, how any one, who believes the &s;crip|tures, could &s;eparate the two ideas. If <HI>only</HI> human, how incon&s;i&s;tent! Here is a human being, who engages in the arduous ta&s;k of redeeming his fellow-creatures from &s;in. We
<PB N="18" REF="15">
mu&s;t either therefore give up all idea of redemp|tion, of which the &s;cripture is every where &s;o full&mdash;or we mu&s;t acknowledge the total <HI>di&s;proportion</HI> of the work.</P>
<P>The idea of redemption indeed is &s;ometimes given up: but &s;till what difficulties remain, unle&s;s we give up the &s;criptures al&s;o? This human being &s;hewed every &s;ign of a divine nature. He knew the thoughts of man; which is always con&s;idered as one of the prerogatives of the Almighty. He could forgive &s;in; tho we all know, that <HI>none can forgive &s;in, but God alone.</HI> This human being al&s;o had the power&mdash;not only of working miracles him&s;elf, which many have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed&mdash;but of commi&s;&s;ion|ing others al&s;o to work them, which no one ever attempted before. This human being, tho cautious in the early part of his mini&s;try; yet as he approached the end of it, &s;poke &s;o freely, that tho&s;e around him declared, <HI>he made him&s;elf equal with God;</HI> which was in fact the ca&s;e. This human being al&s;o was endowed with the &s;trange, and wonderful power of rai&s;ing, not only others&mdash;but him&s;elf al&s;o from the dead: and not only profe&s;&s;ed in his lifetime, that he <HI>would</HI> &s;end&mdash;but after his a&s;cen&s;ion to heaven, he actually <HI>did</HI> &s;end, the Holy Gho&s;t upon his faithful followers; com|municating
<PB N="19" REF="16">
to them powers, unheard of before, for the propagation of his religion. In a word, when we take a comprehen&s;ive view of the &s;crip|tures, and draw together the innumerable pa&s;&s;a|ges, in which this great truth &s;eems &s;o plainly to be contained, it is a difficult matter to con|ceive how a denial of it is con&s;i&s;tent with a belief in what we read. Nor is this a matter to be rea&s;oned upon, like a point of mathematics, or natural philo&s;ophy: nor indeed does there &s;eem a nece&s;&s;ity to adduce the opinions of this, or that father of the church. The hone&s;t application of the rule before us, is all that &s;eems really nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>That we do not under&s;tand this great my&s;|tery is certain: how indeed &s;hould we? but we under&s;tand as much of it, as we do of many other things&mdash;of the union of our &s;ouls and bodies particularly; in which we all believe.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture again, which have been thought more refractory&mdash;with regard, for in&s;tance, to the fore-knowledge of God; and &s;uch doctrines, as are &s;uppo&s;ed to be involved in it. For my&s;elf, I own, I find little difficulty in bringing all the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages to the apo&s;tle's te&s;t of compari&s;on. But if any of them &s;hould be thought more un|yielding;
<PB N="20" REF="17">
in&s;tead of rea&s;oning upon them, we might &s;till content our&s;elves with <HI>comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual.</HI> Tho we may not be able to obtain compleat &s;atisfaction from a compari&s;on with <HI>particular pa&s;&s;ages;</HI> we may &s;urely obtain it from a compari&s;on <HI>with the whole &s;cheme</HI> of the go&s;pel. The go&s;pel was intended for the general good of man; and God's arbitrary will, can never run counter to his revealed will.</P>
<P>We act thus in common life. Suppo&s;e we look into a medical book for the remedy of &s;ome particular di&s;order; and &s;hould there find it pre&s;cribed, that we &s;hould mix a cer|tain quantity of &s;ome drug (a quantity which we know would prove fatal) with other ingre|dients&mdash;how &s;hould we receive &s;uch a pre&s;cription? we know well, that the book is intended to admini&s;ter to our health: but here is a pre&s;cription, which would infallibly de&s;troy us. We &s;hould take it for granted therefore&mdash;either that the drug in que&s;tion was put by mi&s;take for &s;ome other drug&mdash;or if the book were foreign, that it was wrongly tran&s;lated&mdash;or that there was &s;ome mi&s;take in the quantity perhaps&mdash;or perhaps that we might not clearly under&s;tand the pre&s;cription&mdash;
<PB N="21" REF="18">
at any rate, we &s;hould certainly never &s;wallow the potion; becau&s;e it was very plain, that the intention of the book, and the pre&s;cription mu&s;t agree.</P>
<P>Thus the apo&s;tle's rule of comparing <HI>&s;piri|tual things with &s;piritual,</HI> will in all ca&s;es direct us right. One part will generally ex|plain another: but if any part happen to be more unyielding, we cannot be far wrong, if we compare the difficulty, whatever it is, with the general &s;cheme and intention of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But there is one difficulty &s;till behind, which is the greate&s;t of all&mdash;and that is, to bring our minds hone&s;tly to the application of this rule. The mind, when we examine a difficulty of &s;cripture, &s;hould be blank paper. Alas! how often is it already &s;cribbled over with <HI>the words of man's wi&s;dom!</HI> Each of us hath his favourite &s;y&s;tem&mdash;the pride of all his &s;tudious hours&mdash;and in nothing does &s;elf-deceit triumph more, than in giving the&s;e favourite &s;y&s;tems the glo&s;s of &s;cripture. It is the mo&s;t difficult thing in the world to take the eye from &s;ome favourite point, and give it a general ca&s;t. And yet without this, no judgment can be formed.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="19">In examining the works of man, as well as of God, we mu&s;t judge from the <HI>whole,</HI> or our judgment will be erroneous. In archi|tecture, for in&s;tance, &s;hould a man &s;tand clo&s;e to a column, and pronounce boldly, that it was too large, or too &s;mall, we &s;ee at once how ab&s;urd a judgment he might pa&s;s. Whereas, if he &s;hould &s;tep back a little&mdash; take a proper &s;tand, and view the whole in one comprehen&s;ive view, he might perhaps find, that the part objected to, was in exact proportion; and the defect not in the object, but in him&s;elf.&mdash;It is often thus in our &s;crip|tural inquiries: we take a doctrine from a text.</P>
<P>And here I cannot help lamenting the &s;in|gular ill-u&s;age, which the &s;criptures have met with in being frittered into chapter, and ver&s;e, with &s;o little attention to the &s;en&s;e. It is a&s;toni&s;hing that the unauthori&s;ed barbari&s;m of a printer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert Stephens, who was printing a concordance, and a bible at the &s;ame time, and took this method of adapting the one to the other.</NOTE> (I cannot give it a &s;ofter name, tho he was certainly an able, and a learned man), &s;hould be received &s;o univer&s;ally through chri&s;tendom. The only advantage, which

this &s;trange interruption of the &s;en&s;e of &s;crip|ture <HI>can</HI> have, might ju&s;t have been an&s;wered as well by marginal references. In the mean time, the mi&s;chief is glaring. The narrative, or the argument, in&s;tead of running on, like other compo&s;itions, in a continued di&s;cour&s;e, is broken into aphori&s;ms. In other books the paragraph ends, where the &s;en&s;e makes a pau&s;e. In the bible, whatever the &s;en&s;e is, it ends at every third or fourth line. Pa&s;&s;ages, thus in&s;ulated, receive an independent form. The &s;en&s;e in each little paragraph, &s;eems drawn to a point; and the <HI>unlettered</HI> reader at lea&s;t is apt to pau&s;e. Whereas, if he went on, and took all together, he would find, he mu&s;t often affix a very different meaning to the words.</P>
<P>I have frequently heard, for in&s;tance, a ver&s;e at the beginning of the 1&s;t epi&s;tle of St. Peter, <HI>Elect according to the fore-knowledge of God,</HI> alledged as an irrefragable argument in favour of prede&s;tination. But if this ver&s;e were added to the preceding one, from which it is violently &s;eparated, it would appear, that the <HI>whole people</HI> of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, A&s;ia, and Bithynia, are all <HI>the elect according to the fore-knowledge of God.</HI> Now it is ab&s;urd in the la&s;t degree, to &s;uppo&s;e, that the <HI>whole
<PB N="24" REF="21">
bulk</HI> of the&s;e &s;everal nations were in a &s;tate of &s;alvation: at the &s;ame time it is perfectly evan|gelical, to conceive them all invited to partake of the privileges of the go&s;pel, <HI>according to the fore-knowledge of God</HI>&mdash;that is, according to the predictions of the prophets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That this is the &s;en&s;e to be affixed to the <HI>fore-knowledge of God,</HI> is evident from the tenth ver&s;e, in which we are told, that the <HI>prophets prophe&s;ied of the grace that &s;hould come unto the Gentiles:</HI> and if, after &s;o many breaks, we may be allowed to bring the &s;eventeenth ver&s;e into the argument, we are there told plainly, that <HI>God without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, judgeth according to every man's work.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Few judicious churchmen, I &s;uppo&s;e, would wi&s;h for a new tran&s;lation of the bible. It could not &s;oon acquire that general reverence, which is paid to the old one. But many per|haps would de&s;ire to &s;ee the errors of the old one corrected; tho with as little alteration as po&s;&s;ible. The &s;everal late collations of MSS. would render this, I &s;hould think, no very difficult work. If however the wi&s;dom of our &s;uperiors &s;ee any in&s;uperable ob&s;tacle in going &s;o far, one &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, at lea&s;t, there could be none in detaching chapters, and ver&s;es into the margin. They are certainly unauthori&s;ed intruders.</P>
<P>Having thus con&s;idered the pa&s;&s;age of &s;crip|ture, I undertook to di&s;cour&s;e on; and touched,
<PB N="25" REF="22">
tho very &s;lightly, a very important &s;ubject&mdash;&s;o important, and &s;o often tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, that frequent hints upon it, can never be out of &s;ea&s;on&mdash;I &s;hall ju&s;t add a few remarks on the difference between <HI>holding</HI> an error, and <HI>teaching</HI> one.</P>
<P>Error is in&s;eparable from the mind of man. <HI>Humanum e&s;t errare,</HI> was the hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion of nature; and a &s;tate of grace points out the melancholy truth with &s;till greater force. We humbly hope therefore, that as man, and error are &s;o clo&s;ely united, God will pardon our innocent errors&mdash;I mean &s;uch errors, as have no connection with guilt.</P>
<P>But yet our errors, tho innocent, as far as we our&s;elves are concerned, may to others be the &s;ource of great mi&s;chief. While they continue our own thoughts, they affect no|body: but when we &s;uffer them to get abroad, they become cloathed in words&mdash;and perhaps in &s;uch words, as the text calls <HI>the words of man's wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>Thus many excellent men, I doubt not, may have carried the doctrine of faith too high. <HI>Them</HI> it injured not; every chri&s;tian virtue perhaps flowing from it. In <HI>their</HI> minds therefore however erroneous the opinion, it
<PB N="26" REF="23">
may &s;till be innocent.&mdash;But they may fall into a very egregious mi&s;take, if they &s;uppo&s;e from their own pious feelings, that this doctrine has always the &s;ame effect on others. It may create &s;elf-delu&s;ion. I &s;hould fear it might have a tendency to it; and may make men &s;atisfied with them&s;elves. Faith is an ea&s;y &s;ub&s;titute for a good life. <HI>Faith,</HI> they are &s;ure, they have; and as to <HI>works,</HI> they hear them always &s;poken of as of no value; which it is po&s;&s;ible they may be too apt to apply in their own way: &s;o all is well. It is cer|tainly a very dangerous thing, to &s;peak &s;lightly of <HI>works,</HI> le&s;t we &s;hould give a handle to the natural pravity of human nature.</P>
<P>Thus again, with regard to the other im|portant &s;ubject, on which I touched, as there are many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture relating to the humanity of Chri&s;t as well as his divinity, I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf, (as &s;ome pious people have done) that an <HI>exact</HI> faith on this head is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation. Numbers, I have no doubt, will be &s;aved through the merits of Chri&s;t, who conceive him only as their law|giver, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly obey his laws; tho they may not have tho&s;e exalted ideas of his divine nature; to which our &s;criptural rule, I
<PB N="27" REF="24">
think, &s;o directly leads. If their holy lives have attained the principal end of a better faith; they ought not &s;urely to be branded with hard names, and con&s;idered among tho&s;e, <HI>who deny Chri&s;t before men.</HI></P>
<P>We are &s;ometimes told they ought; becau&s;e without this exalted faith in the divine nature of a Saviour, the mind cannot attain tho&s;e elevated heights of love, which the go&s;pel pre&s;cribes.</P>
<P>One &s;hould think &s;o indeed: but before we pa&s;s the&s;e har&s;h cen&s;ures on others, let any of us, who do hold that doctrine, a&s;k our own carnal hearts, whether it purify them in this exalted manner?</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, I think, we have good ground to cen&s;ure tho&s;e, who publicly rai&s;e &s;cruples. Why cannot they be &s;atisfied with keeping their opinions at home?</P>
<P>When a man holds a religious opinion with &s;uch con&s;cientious firmne&s;s, that he gives up his temporal intere&s;ts for it's &s;ake; tho the opinion may be erroneous, the man is virtuous: his character re&s;pectable.&mdash;But if, in&s;tead of &s;uffering manfully for his opinion, he &s;hould &s;et it up as a banner, and call people together under it; he &s;hould then, I think, look well to his motives. There may be a touch of
<PB N="28" REF="25">
latent vanity&mdash;there may be an over-weening of him&s;elf&mdash;the pride of being at the head of a &s;ect&mdash;an oblique view to &s;elf-intere&s;t perhaps &mdash;or &s;ome other undue motive, which may in&s;inuate it&s;elf, without well looking after, into his religious views. To <HI>propagate</HI> any error, is dangerous&mdash;but on di&s;putable motives, it is doubly &s;o. A man is no way put upon it: of cour&s;e, he is an&s;werable for the con&s;e|quence. On a que&s;tion of philo&s;ophy indeed, where an air-pump, or a crucible is concerned, it matters little: but where religion is the &s;ubject, it becomes a point of moment. To be &s;ilent, is at lea&s;t &s;afe. There can be no harm&mdash;and I think, no great &s;hare of mode&s;ty &mdash;in keeping an opinion to your&s;elf, which has always been oppo&s;ed by a great majority, and &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t, and be&s;t men, both laymen, and churchmen, that ever lived.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, the examination of truth can do no harm.</P>
<P>None in the world to the truth it&s;elf. None to the candid, and able examiner of it. But to the undi&s;tingui&s;hing many it may often do great harm. Indeed I know nothing of a more delicate nature, than the management of a polemical controver&s;y. To an&s;wer a bold
<PB N="29" REF="26">
charge, &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary. But to <HI>keep up the &s;pirit</HI> of a di&s;pute by continually replying to an opponent, who is determined never to yield, &s;eems more than is nece&s;&s;ary. It may un&s;et|tle the minds of well-meaning people. It may lead them from things of more con&s;e|quence. It may be offen&s;ive to &s;ee churchmen continually wrangling about points of religion. And tho the&s;e points may often be of little moment in them&s;elves; yet they, who know le&s;s, may think e&s;&s;entials concerned; and the go&s;pel it&s;elf of an un&s;table nature.&mdash;Be&s;ides I &s;hould always fear, that what was gained in argument, would be lo&s;t in piety&mdash; in charity mo&s;t undoubtedly. Holy wars have ever been the wor&s;t of wars; and &s;criptural debates, the mo&s;t intemperate.&mdash;And what end is gained? They rarely convince. People generally hold their own opinions; and the matter ends, as it began<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Prie&s;tley very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that, <Q>there is but little rea&s;on to expect, that any man, who has given the public his opinion on any &s;ubject of importance, will ever retract it.</Q> See his Di&s;qui&s;itions, page 206.</NOTE>. And as to any concern for the &s;ouls of men, in pure charity, one &s;hould think, they will not alledge this. If we allow &s;al|vation
<PB N="30" REF="27">
to their faith, they may &s;urely be as conde&s;cending to ours.</P>
<P>After all, the world hath had enough on the&s;e &s;ubjects. There is not one of them, which hath not been over, and over debated. We have only the old argument dre&s;&s;ed up anew. The &s;ceptical inquirer cannot po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;take his way. The road is tracked by many wheels; and needful guide-po&s;ts are every where &s;et up. From the knowledge abroad in the world, he may ea&s;ily find abun|dance to &s;atisfy all his enquiries.</P>
<P>The great conclu&s;ion from the whole, is, that the mini&s;ters of religion cannot be too cautious in avoiding the words, which <HI>man's wi&s;dom teacheth;</HI> nor too careful <HI>in comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual.</HI> Polemical divinity, no doubt hath a tendency to lead us a&s;ide. The great point before us is very different. In&s;tead of employing our time on the difficult topics of the go&s;pel, which con|cern few; it would &s;erve the cau&s;e of the go&s;pel better, to endeavour by every means, as we are be&s;t able, to inculcate the important truths of religion, which &s;o much concern us all&mdash;the intention, and nece&s;&s;ity of it&mdash;it's graces, and high offers&mdash;it's means of puri|fying
<PB N="31" REF="28">
our nature&mdash;it's conditions, and awful &s;anctions. The&s;e are truths which, tho well known, require daily inculcating; and placing in various lights. On examining therefore the whole intention, and tenor of the go&s;|pel&mdash;on <HI>comparing &s;piritual things with &s;pi|ritual,</HI> we mu&s;t be convinced, that the great|e&s;t &s;ervice we can do to religion&mdash;and the be&s;t obedience we can &s;hew to the go&s;pel, con&s;i&s;ts in our uniting in a con&s;cientious en|deavour to draw a corrupt age to the prac|tice of godline&s;s&mdash;<HI>keeping that which is com|mitted to our tru&s;t, and avoiding profane, and vain babblings, and oppo&s;itions of &s;cience, fal&s;ely &s;o called; which too often &s;poil men through philo&s;ophy, and vain deceit, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chri&s;t.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>

<Q>I fear, le&s;t, by any means, as the &s;erpent beguiled Eve through his &s;ubtilty; &s;o your minds &s;hould be corrupted from the &s;implicity, that is in Chri&s;t.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ONE of the fir&s;t great objects of apo&s;to|lical fear, in the matter of religious corruption, was judai&s;m. The earlie&s;t converts were Jews; and they could not at once be brought to acknowledge the <HI>&s;implicity that is in Chri&s;t.</HI> Deep prejudices had taken root: the authority of Mo&s;es&mdash;their peculiar privileges&mdash;the grandeur of their temple&mdash;and &s;plendor of it's wor&s;hip, had gotten po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their earlie&s;t conceptions; and had filled their minds with ideas, which were not ea&s;ily era&s;ed by the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But tho judai&s;m was the primary object of the apo&s;tle's fear; the pa&s;&s;age before us leads
<PB N="38" REF="32">
us to &s;uppo&s;e, his apprehen&s;ions had here taken another turn; and were rather directed to the temptations of the world.&mdash;We may con&s;ider it indeed, if we plea&s;e, as prophecy. It has certainly the mo&s;t genuine mark of prophecy&mdash; it has been exactly fulfilled. The &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, in it's fir&s;t age, could not be more corrupted by judai&s;m; than it has been &s;ince by a concurrence of other mi&s;chievous cau&s;es.</P>
<P>In the following di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall ju&s;t touch upon a few of tho&s;e cau&s;es, pointed out by the apo&s;tle, which have corrupted the <HI>&s;impli|city that is in Chri&s;t;</HI> and I &s;hall then inquire, what part the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel &s;hould take in this matter. It is a &s;ubject neither new, nor curious. But if it be a common &s;ubject; it is, at lea&s;t, a very intere&s;ting one; and can neither be too often reviewed, nor too deeply impre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In order to &s;ee how the &s;implicity that is in Chri&s;t, hath been corrupted, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to inquire fir&s;t, in what it con&s;i&s;ts. But the apo&s;tle hath not defined it; and there|fore
<PB N="39" REF="33">
we may &s;uppo&s;e, we are to gather a de|finition of it for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Whoever reads the holy &s;criptures with the meek &s;pirit of a learner, will feel the meaning of the expre&s;&s;ion better, than any logical di&s;|tinctions can explain it to him. He will feel the <HI>&s;implicity that is in Chri&s;t</HI> growing upon him more, and more, as he becomes more intimately acquainted with the &s;criptures; and by degrees taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his under&s;tand|ing and affections&mdash;he will feel a di&s;po&s;ition forming it&s;elf in his mind, free from the pre|judices of any &s;ect&mdash;yet indulgent to the opi|nions of all&mdash;open to conviction&mdash;and above di&s;ingenuous cavil&mdash;zealous in &s;earching for the truth&mdash;but gentle in maintaining it&mdash;equally ready to correct an error; and to acknowledge it. He will feel that the &s;implicity, which is in Chri&s;t will form his <HI>heart,</HI> as well as his <HI>faith, and opinions.</HI> He will not allow the precepts of religion to be refined by the glo&s;&s;es of the world&mdash;nor accommodated to it's fa&s;hions&mdash;nor con&s;idered as &s;peculative points. His faith will be a directing prin|ciple; which rai&s;es him above the world&mdash; above it's hopes&mdash;above it's fears&mdash;and forms
<PB N="40" REF="34">
him into a chearful pa&s;&s;enger through this &s;tate of trial; animated only by tho&s;e holy hopes, which the go&s;pel in&s;pires.</P>
<P>That there are now, and have been in all ages, many <HI>individuals,</HI> who may, in a certain degree, be thus characterized, we have no doubt. But where &s;hall we find the <HI>national character</HI> of a people under this de&s;cription? In early days, when chri&s;tians were of <HI>one heart, and one &s;oul,</HI> we may &s;uppo&s;e, that heart, and &s;oul were truly chri&s;tian. But it was at a time, when, we read, they had <HI>all things in common.</HI> When the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinc|tions of &s;ociety began to take place; then began al&s;o among chri&s;tians, an oppo&s;ition between the &s;pirit of the world, and the <HI>&s;implicity, that is in Chri&s;t.</HI> This &s;implicity was in a degree tainted, even before the miraculous powers of the church cea&s;ed; and we may be a&s;&s;ured the mi&s;chievous &s;pirit, which then ap|peared, has not been idle through &s;o long a tract of time; but hath continued extending it's influence in &s;ome countries more, in others le&s;s, according to the various circum&s;tances of each. The New Te&s;tament is the record of the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel: and modern
<PB N="41" REF="35">
hi&s;tory, but above all eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, is the record of it's corruption.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle of the text is writing to the converts of a trading, and opulent town; not barbarous, and uninformed; but inlightened by all the philo&s;ophy, and worldly wi&s;dom at that time in e&s;teem. He fore&s;aw what temptations their peculiar circum&s;tances would draw them into. Worldly ideas of various kinds&mdash;vanity, pride, and ambition&mdash;avarice, profu&s;ion, and &s;en&s;uality; in a word, all the arts of rai&s;ing a fortune; and all the arts of con&s;uming one, he knew, would be conti|nually operating before their eyes: and how the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel might be able to oppo&s;e the&s;e fa&s;cinating delu&s;ions, was the object of his fear.</P>
<P>Again, it might be in equal danger from the refinements of philo&s;ophy; and the acute rea&s;onings of learned men; who trying it's &s;imple principles by canons of human inven|tion, and rules of logical exactne&s;s, would from the&s;e pronounce boldly on it's incon&s;i&s;tences, and defects.</P>
<P>The &s;implicity of the go&s;pel might be power|fully oppo&s;ed too by the ridicule of men of
<PB N="42" REF="36">
wit; who taking their topics of compari&s;on from the fa&s;hions, and practices of the world, might di&s;play the folly, and ab&s;urdity of &s;uch doctrines, as they were inclined to di&s;coun|tenance.</P>
<P>All this was perfectly ea&s;y: for as chri&s;ti|anity, and the world were at variance; argu|ments drawn from the world, and addre&s;&s;ed to the world, were &s;ure of being favourably heard.</P>
<P>That the&s;e were the motives of the apo&s;tle's apprehen&s;ion, is very plain: for he tells his converts, he fears, they &s;hould be corrupted, as <HI>the &s;erpent had beguiled Eve.</HI> To know therefore how that matter &s;tood, we need only turn to the record of the fatal deed. <HI>When the woman &s;aw that the tree was good for food; and that it was plea&s;ant to the eye; and a tree to be de&s;ired to make one wi&s;e, &s;he took of the fruit thereof, and did eat.</HI></P>
<P>Short as this account is, we find in it a combination of intere&s;t, plea&s;ure, vanity, and a fal&s;e ta&s;te for knowledge, all co-operating, through the wiles of the devil, to impo&s;e upon our fir&s;t parent. With the&s;e delu&s;ions, &s;he was corrupted; and with the&s;e delu&s;ions we
<PB N="43" REF="37">
conclude the apo&s;tle feared his Corinthian converts might be corrupted al&s;o.</P>
<P>How far our ca&s;e may be &s;imilar to that of the Corinthian converts, I &s;hould rather leave as matter of inference. All I wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h on <HI>this head,</HI> is, that we are a&s;&s;ured, on the authority of an apo&s;tle, that the <HI>&s;impli|city, which is in Chri&s;t,</HI> may be corrupted by &s;uch temptations, as certainly <HI>do</HI> abound among&s;t us&mdash;in our manners&mdash;in our amu&s;ements&mdash;in our literary pur&s;uits; and in our general modes of intercour&s;e with each other.</P>
<P>Some theori&s;ts may amu&s;e them&s;elves with an opinion, that religion is in a progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate. It is at lea&s;t a plea&s;ing theory&mdash;and in one &s;en&s;e, no doubt, a very ju&s;t one. If we believe in prophecy, we mu&s;t believe, that the go&s;pel will not only &s;pread over the face of the earth; but that it's pre&s;ent &s;tate is a kind of preparation for that glorious &s;tate, of which we obtain a <HI>general conception</HI> from the apoca|lyp&s;e of St. John; tho the lofty figures em|ployed in that de&s;cription, leave the <HI>detail</HI> ob|&s;cure.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this <HI>general progre&s;s</HI> of the go&s;pel, we may &s;uppo&s;e it's light to be &s;ome|times
<PB N="44" REF="38">
ob&s;cured in particular countries&mdash;or, in the apo&s;tle's language, it's <HI>&s;implicity corrupted.</HI> On this head I fear the general prevailing manners of our own country will not &s;tand a &s;criptural te&s;t.</P>
<P>As the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel make a part of this tainted ma&s;s, we mu&s;t not flatter our|&s;elves, that we are not, in a degree, corrupted al&s;o. We read, in early days, of <HI>deceitful workers transforming them&s;elves into the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t;</HI> and we cannot conceive, that the&s;e <HI>deceitful workers</HI> are more uncommon now, or the&s;e <HI>transformations</HI> more rare. I mean not however at pre&s;ent to pur&s;ue &s;o ingrateful a theme; I &s;hould rather wi&s;h to inquire, how far we have it in our power to counteract &s;uch corruption.</P>
<P>Even to oppo&s;e this torrent, with any &s;ucce&s;s, no doubt, may be difficult enough. To re|&s;tore the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel is a vain thought. For that great event we mu&s;t wait devoutly for tho&s;e times, to which I have ju&s;t alluded, when all offence &s;hall be done away.</P>
<P>Some things may be wrong, which the legi&s;lature only can rectify: and tho we ac|knowledge
<PB N="45" REF="39">
the difficulty of moving the&s;e &s;acred foundations; yet favourable opportunities may perhaps ari&s;e, in future time, when a few things, which are now rather offen&s;ive, may be brought nearer the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel. Many of our able&s;t churchmen have freely ex|pre&s;&s;ed their wi&s;hes on this head; and as the&s;e wi&s;hes become more general, they will of cour&s;e, obtain more weight. E&s;tabli&s;hments however, after all, nece&s;&s;ary as they are, mu&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> bring on their attendant evils; which &s;erious men may bemoan&mdash;and in <HI>part</HI> may rectify; but, on the <HI>whole,</HI> they will ever have cau&s;e to lament, that the <HI>nature of things,</HI> in this corrupt &s;tate, is mixed with evil&mdash;and that the <HI>nature of man,</HI> will turn even his ble&s;&s;ings into mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o greatly to lament, that the man|ners of the great, are, in general, &s;o far removed from the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel; becau&s;e the manners of the great will ever be the principal &s;ource of national manners. It is a happine&s;s however, that in general the&s;e vitiated &s;cenes are removed from the eyes of the people: and yet enough &s;ometimes gets abroad to a&s;toni&s;h tho&s;e, who happily live at a di&s;tance from them. There is one day
<PB N="46" REF="40">
particularly, on which the great, and little world are, in &s;ome degree, on a level; and one place, in which they meet on an equal footing. We have it ever to lament, that &s;o plea&s;ing a har|mony&mdash;an in&s;titution &s;o delightfully calculated to in&s;ure benevolence by united devotion through the whole ma&s;s of the people, &s;hould be &s;o generally di&s;regarded. Even the very poli|tical u&s;e of this &s;acred in&s;titution, if it had no other, were &s;ufficient to inforce a general ob&s;ervance of it on all, who have a love for public order. But the great &s;hould con&s;ider farther, that if <HI>they</HI> have no need of in&s;truction &mdash;their <HI>inferiors</HI> at lea&s;t have; who are al|ways ready, on this, and every occa&s;ion, to &s;hew their betters, how much they approve, and value the bad examples they &s;et them.</P>
<P>Let things however be wrong in what de|gree they will&mdash;let the great and little world unite in treating the <HI>&s;implicity, that is in Chri&s;t</HI> with what contempt they plea&s;e, it is &s;till our part to do our be&s;t to pre&s;erve it; and to keep the remains of religion, as far as we can, and as long as we can, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among&s;t us. Tho the <HI>whole head is &s;ick, and the heart faint,</HI> and the phy&s;ician's be&s;t &s;kill can only palliate; it is always &s;omething to go &s;o far.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="41">Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour calls the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel <HI>the &s;alt of the earth.</HI> It is a mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive figure. It &s;hews not only that there will be great corruption in the earth; but it &s;hews farther, that the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are the means, which God has appointed to oppo&s;e this corruption. Tho our influence cannot pre&s;erve the whole; yet &s;till it may pre&s;erve a part. Tho we may have no effect on the general bulk of mankind; yet there may be many an individual, who&s;e hone&s;t heart we may retain in the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>We are not legi&s;lators; and things would not go on better, if we were. The only means, which we have to employ in this matter, lie in two ea&s;y words, our <HI>doctrine,</HI> and our <HI>manners;</HI> in both of which it &s;hould be our utmo&s;t endeavour to attain, as far as we can, and to impre&s;s upon others, the <HI>&s;im|plicity that is in Chri&s;t.</HI> The former, we mu&s;t endeavour to pre&s;erve from the corruptions of <HI>worldly wi&s;dom;</HI> the latter from the corrup|tions of <HI>worldly fa&s;hions.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>explain the word of God,</HI> is certainly the mo&s;t arduous bu&s;ine&s;s, in which the rea&s;on of man can engage. Every explanation of the
<PB N="48" REF="42">
&s;acred text, is, in fact, putting our own &s;en&s;e upon the words of &s;cripture: and when we con&s;ider the very &s;upine ignorance of the ge|nerality of the common people, who take their ideas of religion from <HI>what we tell them;</HI> it is certainly a very awful thought, and &s;hould make us endeavour to keep as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ible to the <HI>&s;implicity, that is in Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>It is in vain to attempt this without a thorough acquaintance with &s;cripture; which will always &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages to the me|mory, as, on a compari&s;on with the &s;ubject we are upon, may direct us to the true &s;crip|tural &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The lawyer is obliged to &s;tudy with at|tention a number of books, and to examine a variety of parallel ca&s;es, before he can be qualified to act in his profe&s;&s;ion. The phy&s;i|cian is under the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity. And is it not a mortifying con&s;ideration, that, becau&s;e the common people are obliged to take our pre&s;criptions, ju&s;t as we plea&s;e to pre&s;cribe, we &s;hould for that rea&s;on pre&s;cribe carele&s;ly; and without &s;ufficiently con&s;ulting that book, which alone will enable us to do it pro|perly?</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="43">Some think the <HI>&s;implicity, that is in Chri&s;t,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in cloathing their &s;entiments always in <HI>&s;cripture-phra&s;e.</HI> I &s;ee no more rea&s;on for this, than for going about, as the apo&s;tles did, in &s;andals, with a &s;crip, and a &s;taff. Modes of &s;peech are ju&s;t as much the fa&s;hion of times, and countries, as modes of dre&s;s; and need be as little ob&s;erved. The &s;criptural mode of &s;peech is highly figurative&mdash;very dif|ferent from any mode now in u&s;e; and re|quires tran&s;lation, as much as the original Greek. It is the <HI>&s;criptural idea,</HI> not the <HI>&s;criptural mode of expre&s;&s;ion;</HI> for which I am contending: and this may be lo&s;t in many ways. It may be narrowed to &s;peak the opinions of a &s;ect&mdash;or, it may be widened to &s;peak the opinions of the world&mdash;or it may be lo&s;t in morals; when in&s;tead of preaching plainly, and &s;imply on go&s;pel-&s;ubjects, our di&s;cour&s;es, with &s;criptural mottoes affixed, are &s;hort immethodical e&s;&s;ays; in which the be|ginning can hardly be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the end&mdash;nor indeed what is aimed at, till the book is clo&s;ed, ju&s;t as the audience may &s;up|po&s;e the &s;ubject will open.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="44">There is another thing al&s;o, which often occa&s;ions our erring from the <HI>&s;implicity, which is in Chri&s;t.</HI> As the go&s;pel is a covenant be|tween God and man, it touches, of cour&s;e, on &s;uch things, as relate to both. As far as it relates to God, it is, no doubt, a deep, my&s;terious &s;ubject; but as far as it relates to man, nothing can be more &s;imple, and ea&s;y. Hence it is, that our religion, without any contradiction of terms, (peace be to all &s;cep|tical cavils!) is &s;ometimes called the <HI>my&s;tery of godline&s;s;</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel.</HI> It is the <HI>my&s;tery of godline&s;s,</HI> as it relates to God's part in this gracious plan; and the <HI>&s;implicity of the go&s;pel,</HI> as it relates to us. To the want of &s;ufficient attention to this ea&s;y di&s;tinction perhaps ari&s;e not only many of the di&s;putes, and mi&s;conceptions, and infu|&s;ions of worldly wi&s;dom, which have &s;o often di&s;|graced the go&s;pel: but al&s;o much of that &s;trange, unaccountable confu&s;ion of ideas, that perplexes, and confounds the under&s;tanding of the lower people. If the lo&s;t condition of man&mdash;his re&s;toration, and redemption by Chri&s;t&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ity of a holy life&mdash;the tendency of the
<PB N="51" REF="45">
go&s;pel to make him happy both here, and hereafter&mdash;and other plain points, had gene|rally been the &s;ubjects of popular di&s;cour&s;es, we &s;hould not have had now that gro&s;s ig|norance in matters of religion, and that va|riety of &s;trange notions, and prejudices to com|bat; which we find among&s;t the common people, on all religious &s;ubjects; but e&s;peci|ally on the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper. As nothing is more difficult than to eradicate old prejudices; nothing would have been more ea&s;y than to have prevented their getting ground at fir&s;t. The plain truths of the go&s;pel might have de&s;cended ju&s;t as ea&s;ily as mi&s;conception and error.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be our care then to accommodate our doctrine, as much as we can, to the <HI>&s;im|plicity that is in Chri&s;t</HI>&mdash;not to dwell upon it's <HI>my&s;terious parts</HI>&mdash;not to enter into the in|quiries, how? and why?&mdash;nor to clog it with difficult, or refined que&s;tions; again&s;t which the apo&s;tle to Timothy, long ago, took abun|dant pains to guard us; but to preach it, as we are directed, with plainne&s;s&mdash;to lay the &s;tre&s;s on it's obvious truths&mdash;and when we
<PB N="52" REF="46">
have occa&s;ion to mention a my&s;terious point, (one of tho&s;e great points, which relate to God's part in the covenant of grace, rather than to man's) to be very careful of going too far&mdash;to keep as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ible to &s;crip|ture, le&s;t we make a difficulty more difficult by endeavouring to explain, what cannot be explained. The le&s;s, in general, that is &s;aid on &s;uch points, the better.&mdash;One thing we &s;hould always remember; and that is to adapt our di&s;cour&s;es to the <HI>lower,</HI> rather than the <HI>higher</HI> parts of our audience; that we may, like good mini&s;ters, di&s;pen&s;e that go&s;pel; who&s;e peculiar characteri&s;tic it was, to <HI>be preached to the poor.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this head, with the account, which an ancient heathen of the fourth century gives of the mode of preaching the go&s;pel in his day. <Q>The chri&s;tian philo&s;ophy, &s;ays he, is very &s;imple. It's principal concern is to regulate the manners of men; and to infu&s;e worthy notions of the Deity. Ob|&s;cure que&s;tions, and nice arguments, it avoids. Nor does it enter into the nature and foundation of virtue: but exhorts, in a general way, to the practice of it; which
<PB N="53" REF="47">
experience &s;hews us is more effectual among the vulgar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lardner's Te&s;timonies from Alexander of Lycopolis. Vol. IV. p. 11.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Tho this hone&s;t heathen had not a com|pleat idea of chri&s;tianity, he &s;eems however to have had &s;o good a notion of it, that many chri&s;tian pa&s;tors might take a le&s;&s;on from him.</P>
<P>Our <HI>manners</HI> &s;hould be as &s;imple as our <HI>doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>But you a&s;k, what is &s;implicity of manners? It is a phra&s;e of ambiguous meaning.</P>
<P>Let us not here again, puzzle our&s;elves with definitions. They who &s;eek for clo&s;e definitions on the&s;e &s;ubjects, I &s;hould fear, &s;eek rather for eva&s;ion, than information. The &s;criptures have little to do with definitions. On the&s;e &s;ubjects, they &s;peak to the heart, more than to the head. Whoever reads, with a de&s;ire to learn, the in&s;tructions, which our Saviour, and his apo&s;tles, give to the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, will &s;oon feel&mdash;unle&s;s indeed it be a point, which he wi&s;hes to overlook&mdash;
<PB N="54" REF="48">
not only in what the &s;implicity of our man|ners &s;hould con&s;i&s;t&mdash;but al&s;o, that it &s;hould be our fir&s;t, and mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ible care.</P>
<P>And the rea&s;on of the thing, as we are preachers of the go&s;pel, is plain; becau&s;e the &s;implicity of our manners mu&s;t give force to what we &s;ay. It is not every body, with his be&s;t endeavour, who can get hold of the propere&s;t method of communicating his ideas; or can practice that mode of application in his di&s;|cour&s;es, either publicly, or privately, which may have the be&s;t effect upon the people. But &s;implicity of manners is a mode of preach|ing, which makes up many defects&mdash;it is adapted to every capacity&mdash;every body under|&s;tands it; and it adds a dignity, and con&s;e|quence even to a di&s;cour&s;e of le&s;s weight. Tho the common people are no good rea&s;on|ers, there is however one mode of rea&s;oning, at which they are very ready&mdash;that of inferring <HI>doctrine</HI> from <HI>manners:</HI> and they will not only make the latter a te&s;t of the former; but they will in general pay more attention to it like|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>When the city of Antioch was di&s;po&s;ed to receive the go&s;pel; and the apo&s;tle Barnabas was &s;ent from Jeru&s;alem to promote the good
<PB N="55" REF="49">
work, which was there carrying on, the peo|ple &s;eem to have been particularly influenced by his holy life; <Q>for he was a good man, <HI>&s;ays the apo&s;tolical hi&s;torian,</HI> and full of the Holy Gho&s;t, and of faith&mdash;and much people was added unto the Lord.</Q></P>
<P>On the other hand, the pure&s;t doctrine will lo&s;e it's effect, among the common people at lea&s;t, in proportion as they &s;ee their mi|ni&s;ter pay le&s;s attention to it him&s;elf. That apo&s;tolical apo&s;trophe, <HI>Thou that preache&s;t to others, teache&s;t thou not thy&s;elf?</HI> will ever be the language of popular contempt.</P>
<P>There is another kind of contempt al&s;o, which every con&s;i&s;tent man would particularly wi&s;h to avoid&mdash;and that is his own contempt of him&s;elf. What mu&s;t that man's feelings be, who&s;e life is &s;pent in a continued variance with tho&s;e truths, which he is <HI>obliged to preach?</HI> who mu&s;t tell his hearers of governing their undue affections; and yet lets his own loo&s;e in all the vanities of a di&s;&s;ipated age? who mu&s;t talk of the world as a pilgrimage: while every action of his life &s;hews it to be his carnal home? who is obliged to preach the glories of a future &s;tate, and the joys of heaven: while his own happine&s;s is plainly
<PB N="56" REF="50">
centered in worldly ambition, and worldly attentions?&mdash;Contempt abroad may be borne, if a man feel from the uprightne&s;s of his own heart, that he does not de&s;erve it: but there is no refuge from contempt within&mdash;unle&s;s a man is pa&s;t feeling, and &s;ets at defiance the remon&s;trances even of common decency.</P>
<P><HI>How far</HI> the mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel &s;hould keep at a di&s;tance from the world&mdash;from it's ambitious views&mdash;it's intere&s;ts&mdash;and it's party-contentions&mdash;<HI>how far</HI> he &s;hould &s;tand aloof from it's plea&s;ures; and ab&s;tain from many amu&s;ements, which tho perhaps innocent in them&s;elves, may, (at lea&s;t when countenanced by him,) have a tendency to <HI>break down the fences</HI> of religion, are que&s;tions&mdash;not proper indeed for me to determine: but very proper for every churchman to examine &s;eriou&s;ly in his own con&s;cience. It is becoming &s;urely that the mini&s;ters of a religion, which &s;o in|tirely di&s;claims the world, &s;hould endeavour at lea&s;t not to be much intangled in it. A moro&s;e character is not the alternative. Cheer|fulne&s;s is the natural companion of religion. Sourne&s;s is an alien intruder. Amu&s;ements too are nece&s;&s;ary: but I am not &s;ingular in thinking tho&s;e amu&s;ements &s;hould rather be
<PB N="57" REF="51">
of the retired kind; than &s;ought for amid&s;t the noi&s;e, and bu&s;tle of the world. Riot, and exce&s;s generally attend the amu&s;ements of a number of people a&s;&s;embled with a purpo&s;e of being joyous; and what none would do alone, is not &s;crupled perhaps, where the <HI>im|propriety</HI> (which, by the way, de&s;erves often a &s;everer name) is divided among a multitude. In &s;cenes like the&s;e, the clerical <HI>habit</HI> is a blot: the clerical <HI>character,</HI> a &s;till greater. I would not be thought har&s;h: I would not be thought uncomplying. The world, I know, is often &s;hocked at hearing the precepts of the go&s;pel oppo&s;ed, in all their plainne&s;s, to the elegant fa&s;hions, which it adopts: and we are &s;ometimes almo&s;t afraid, in our popu|lar di&s;cour&s;es, of opening go&s;pel-truths &s;o fully as we might; le&s;t by &s;aying more than the times will bear, we &s;hould injure a cau&s;e, which we wi&s;h to advance. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf was often obliged to &s;peak in parables. But let the world, if it plea&s;e, be the <HI>deaf adder, which &s;toppeth it's ears,</HI> there need be no apology &s;urely for recommending go&s;pel-truths in the plaine&s;t manner to the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="52">But the clerical character may be a check upon improprieties.</P>
<P>I &s;hould fear, not much. As we have the example however of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, who kept company with publicans, and &s;inners with a view to reform them; nothing farther can be &s;aid, if this be the <HI>real motive:</HI> tho to me it appears ri&s;king more, than the pro|bability of advantage will in&s;ure.</P>
<P>After all, my brethren, it may be an ea&s;y matter, in an age of licence, to <HI>&s;atisfy</HI> our|&s;elves&mdash;if we make the <HI>compari&s;on only with others:</HI> but I hope this is a kind of <HI>&s;atisfaction,</HI> and a kind of <HI>compari&s;on,</HI> in which none of us would willingly acquie&s;ce. We talk of &s;ectaries, and novel teachers; and cry, <HI>the people have itching ears.</HI> Would to God, no blame in this matter may re&s;t upon our&s;elves! To &s;peak with truth and candour, there does not &s;eem, in general, to be &s;o much &s;implicity, and propriety of manners among&s;t <HI>us,</HI> as there appears to be among&s;t &s;everal of our <HI>di&s;&s;enting brethren.</HI></P>
<P>But propriety of manners is the di&s;&s;enter's chief &s;upport. It is his worldly engine: and therefore his <HI>motives</HI> may be as worldly as ours.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="53">They may, or may not be, for any thing we know. We have nothing to do with any motives but our own. It concerns us more to con&s;ider, whether certain truths lie not nearer home? Whether the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed churchman declines the <HI>heat of the day,</HI> becau&s;e his wages are double? Whether he &s;pend his &s;uperfluity on the vanities of life, becau&s;e tho&s;e wages are abundant?&mdash;or, whe|ther his manners are more lax, becau&s;e tho&s;e wages are more certain?&mdash;<HI>The harve&s;t truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few,</HI> was a com|plaint of great authority in very early days&mdash; Things are not mended I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, now. It is inconceivable how wrong the &s;piritual affairs of a pari&s;h get in a little time. Habits of vice, and inattention to every thing &s;erious, make a quick progre&s;s. A few carele&s;s pa&s;tors, &s;ucceeding each other, leave a pari&s;h in a &s;tate of heatheni&s;m; and it mu&s;t be a work of time, and labour&mdash;of length of time, of accumu|lated labour, to recover it from it's &s;upinene&s;s. A generation may be lo&s;t; and no hope left but in a ri&s;ing one&mdash;Whereas, if the care of one mini&s;ter &s;ucceeded to that of another, each uniting &s;implicity of doctrine, with &s;im|plicity
<PB N="60" REF="54">
of manners, in a few years a great change might be wrought.</P>
<P>Thus, my brethren, I have given you my thoughts on a &s;ubject&mdash;not very recondite indeed; but very intere&s;ting. It is a &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;a bu&s;ine&s;s too, in which we have all voluntarily engaged. We have all <HI>put our hands to the plough</HI>&mdash;and we know the con&s;e|quence of <HI>looking back.</HI> Let us then cheer|fully proceed; evermore uniting our prayers with our endeavours, that God would, of his infinite mercy grant, we may <HI>both by our</HI> PREACHING, <HI>and</HI> LIVING, SET FORTH <HI>his holy word, and</HI> SHEW <HI>it accordingly.</HI></P>
