</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1485" UNIT="year"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t 22.</NOTE> THE victory, which the
earl of Richmond gained at Bo&s;worth over Richard the third, was entirely
deci&s;ive; being attended, as well with the total rout and di&s;per&s;ion of
the royal army, as with the death of the King him&s;elf. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acce&s;&s;ion of Henry VII.</NOTE> The joy of
&s;o great &s;ucce&s;s &s;uddenly prompted the &s;oldiers, in the field of
battle, to be&s;tow on their victorious general the appellation of King, which
he had not hitherto a&s;&s;umed; and the acclamations of <HI>Long live Henry
the &s;eventh,</HI> by a natural and unpremeditated movement, re&s;ounded from
all quar|ters. To be&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ow &s;ome
appearance of formality on this &s;pecies of military election, Sir William
Stanley brought a crown of ornament, which Richard wore in battle, 
<PB N="2" REF="8"> and which had been found among the &s;poils; and he put it
on the head of the conqueror. Henry him&s;elf remained not in &s;u&s;pen&s;e,
but immediately, without he&s;itation, accepted of the magnificent pre&s;ent,
which was tendered him. He was come to the great cri&s;is of his fortune; and
being obliged &s;uddenly to deter|mine him&s;elf, amid&s;t great difficulties,
which he mu&s;t have frequently revolved in his mind, he cho&s;e that party,
which his ambition &s;ugge&s;ted to him, and to which he &s;eemed to be
conducted by his pre&s;ent pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His title to the crown.</NOTE> THERE were
many titles, on which Henry could found his right to the throne; but no one of
them free from great objections, if con&s;idered, either with re&s;pect to
ju&s;tice or to policy.</P>
<P>DURING &s;ome years, Henry had been regarded as heir to the
hou&s;e of Lanca&s;|ter, by the party attached to that family; but the title of
the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter it&s;elf to the crown was generally e&s;teemed to be
very ill founded. Henry the fourth, who had fir&s;t rai&s;ed that family to
royal dignity, had never clearly deter|mined the foundation of his claim; and
while he plainly invaded the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he had not acknowledged
the election of the people. The Parliament had indeed often recognized the
title of the Lanca&s;trian princes; but the&s;e votes had little authority,
being con&s;idered as in&s;tances of prudent complai&s;ance towards a family in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of pre&s;ent power: And they had accordingly been often
rever&s;ed during the late prevalence of the hou&s;e of York. Prudent men
al&s;o, who had been willing, for the &s;ake of peace, to &s;ubmit to any
e&s;tabli&s;hed authority, de&s;ired not to &s;ee the claims of a family
revived, which mu&s;t produce many con|vul&s;ions at pre&s;ent, and which
disjointed for the future the whole &s;y&s;tem of here|ditary right. Be&s;ides;
allowing the title of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter to be legal, Henry him&s;elf
was not the true heir of that family; and nothing but the ob&s;ti|nacy of
faction, which never, without the utmo&s;t reluctance, will &s;ubmit to their
antagoni&s;ts, could have engaged the partizans of that hou&s;e to adopt the
earl of Richmond as their head. His mother indeed, Margaret, counte&s;s of
Richmond, was &s;ole daughter and heire&s;s of John duke of Somer&s;et,
grand&s;on to John of Gaunt duke of Lanca&s;ter: But the birth of the fir&s;t
of the Somer&s;et line was it&s;elf illegitimate and even adulterous. And tho'
the duke of Lanca&s;ter had obtained the legitimation of his natural children
by a patent of Richard the &s;econd, con|firmed in Parliament; it might
ju&s;tly be doubted, whether this Deed could be|&s;tow any title to the Crown;
&s;ince in the patent it&s;elf all the privileges conferred by it are fully
enumerated, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the kingdom, by being omitted, is
thereby tacitly excluded. In all the &s;ettlements of the crown, made during
the reigns of the Lanca&s;trian princes, the line of Somer&s;et had been
entirely over|looked; and it was not till the failure of the legitimate branch,
that men had paid any attention to their claim. And to add to the general
di&s;&s;atisfaction again&s;t <PB N="3" REF="9"> Henry's title, his mother,
from whom he derived all his right, was &s;till alive; and evidently preceded
him in the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE title of the hou&s;e of York, both from the plain rea&s;on
of the ca&s;e, and from the late popular government of Edward the fourth, had
obtained uni|ver&s;ally the preference in the &s;entiments of the people; and
Henry might engraft his claim on the right of that family, by his intended
marriage with the prince&s;s Elizabeth, the heire&s;s of it; a marriage, which
he had &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to ce|lebrate, and to the expectation of which he
had chiefly owed all his pa&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es. But many rea&s;ons di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">waded Henry from adopting this expedient. Were he to
receive the crown only in right of his &s;pou&s;e, his power, he knew, would be
very limited; and he mu&s;t expect rather to enjoy the bare title of king by a
&s;pecies of courte&s;y, than po&s;&s;e&s;s the real authority which belongs to
it. Should the prince&s;s die before him without i&s;&s;ue, he mu&s;t de&s;cend
from the throne, and give place to the next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: And even, if
his bed &s;hould be ble&s;t with offspring, it &s;eemed dangerous to expect,
that filial piety in his children would prevail over the ambition of obtaining
pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of regal power. An act of Parliament, indeed,
might be ea&s;ily procured to &s;ettle the crown on him during his life, but
Henry knew how much &s;uperior the claim of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by blood was to
the votes of an a&s;&s;embly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon in Kennet's compleat
Hi&s;tory, p. 579.</NOTE>, which had always been overborne by violence in the
&s;hock of contending titles, and which had ever been more governed by the
conjunctures of the times, than by any con&s;iderations derived from rea&s;on
or public intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THERE was yet a third foundation, on which Henry might re&s;t
his claim, the right of conque&s;t, by his victory over Richard, the pre&s;ent
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the crown. But be&s;ides that Richard him&s;elf was deemed
no better than an u&s;urper, the army, which fought again&s;t him,
con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of Engli&s;hmen; and a right of con|que&s;t over England
could never be e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;uch a victory. Nothing al&s;o would give
greater umbrage to the nation than a claim of this nature; which might be
con&s;trued as an abolition of all their rights and privileges, and the
e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of de&s;potic authority in the &s;overeign<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 579.</NOTE>. William him&s;elf, the Nor|man, tho' at the
head of a powerful and victorious army of foreigners, had at fir&s;t declined
the invidious title of conqueror; and it was not till the full
e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of his authority that he had ventured to advance &s;o
violent and de|&s;tructive a preten&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT Henry knew, that there was another foundation of authority,
&s;omewhat re&s;embling the right of conque&s;t, to wit, pre&s;ent
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and that this title, guarded by vigour and ability, would
be &s;ufficient to &s;ecure perpetual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. He had
before him the example of Henry the fourth; who, &s;up|ported by no better
preten&s;ion, had &s;ubdued many in&s;urrections, and had at la&s;t 
<PB N="4" REF="10"> been able to tran&s;mit the crown peaceably to his
po&s;terity. He was &s;en&s;ible, that this title, which had been perpetuated
thro' three &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of the family of Lanca&s;ter, might &s;till have
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted, notwith&s;tanding the preferable claim of the hou&s;e of York;
had not the &s;cepter devolved into the hands of Henry the &s;ixth, which were
too feeble to &s;u&s;tain it. In&s;tructed by the&s;e recent experiences,
Hen|ry was determined to put him&s;elf in pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of regal
authority; and to &s;how all oppo&s;ers, that nothing but force of arms and a
&s;ucce&s;sful war would be able to expel him. His claim as heir to the hou&s;e
of Lanca&s;ter he was re&s;olved to advance; and never allow it to be
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed: And he hoped that this title, fa|voured by the partizans of
that family, and &s;econded by pre&s;ent power, would &s;ecure him a perpetual
and an independant authority.</P>
<P>THESE views of Henry are not expo&s;ed to much blame; becau&s;e
founded on good policy, and even on a &s;pecies of nece&s;&s;ity: But there
entered into all his mea&s;ures and councils another motive, which admits not
of the &s;ame apology. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's preju|dice again&s;t the hou&s;e of
York.</NOTE> The violent contentions, which, during &s;o long a period, had
been maintained between the rival families of York and Lanca&s;ter, and the
many &s;anguinary re|venges which they had mutually exerci&s;ed on each other,
had inflamed the oppo|&s;ite factions into a high pitch of animo&s;ity. Henry
him&s;elf, who had &s;een mo&s;t of his near friends and relations peri&s;h in
the field or on the &s;caffold, and who had been expo&s;ed in his own per&s;on
to many hard&s;hips and dangers, had imbibed a violent antipathy to the York
party, which no time nor experience were ever able to efface. In&s;tead of
embracing the pre&s;ent happy opportunity of aboli&s;hing the&s;e fatal
di&s;tinctions, of uniting his title with that of his &s;pou&s;e, and of
be&s;towing favour indifferently on the friends of both families; he carried
into the throne all the partialities which belong to the head of a faction, and
even the pa&s;&s;ions, which are carefully guarded again&s;t by every true
politician in that &s;ituation. To exalt the Lanca&s;trian party, to depre&s;s
the retainers of the hou&s;e of York, were &s;till the favourite objects of his
pur&s;uit; and thro' the whole cour&s;e of his reign, he never forgot the&s;e
early prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Incapable from his natural temper of a more
enlarged and more benevolent &s;y&s;tem of policy, he expo&s;ed him&s;elf to
many pre&s;ent inconveniencies, by too anxiou&s;ly guarding again&s;t that
future po&s;&s;ible event, which might disjoin his title from that of the
prince&s;s, whom he e&s;pou&s;ed. And while he treated the Yorki&s;ts as
enemies, he &s;oon ren|dered them &s;uch, and taught them to di&s;cu&s;s that
right to the crown, which he &s;o carefully kept &s;eparate; and to perceive
its weakne&s;s and invalidity.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of Henry, as well as to his
&s;u&s;picious politics, we are to a&s;cribe the mea&s;ure, which he embraced
two days after the battle of Bo&s;worth. Edward Plantagenet, earl of Warwic,
&s;on to the unfortunate duke of Clarence, was detained in a &s;pecies of
con&s;inement at Sherif-Hutton in York&s;hire by the <PB N="5" REF="11">
jealou&s;y of his uncle, Richard; who&s;e title to the throne was inferior to
that of the young prince. Warwic had now rea&s;on to expect better treatment,
as he was no ob&s;tacle to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion either of Henry or Elizabeth;
and from a boy of &s;uch tender years no danger could rea&s;onably be
apprehended. But Sir Robert Willoughby was di&s;patched by Henry with orders to
take him from Sherif-Hut|ton, to convey him to the Tower, and to retain him in
clo&s;e cu&s;tody<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 579. Polydore Virgil, p.
565.</NOTE>. The &s;ame me&s;&s;enger carried directions, that the prince&s;s
Elizabeth, who had been confined to the &s;ame place, &s;hould be conducted to
London, in order to meet Henry, and there celebrate her e&s;pou&s;als.</P>
<P>HENRY him&s;elf &s;et out for the capital, and advanced by
&s;low journies. Not to rou&s;e the jealou&s;y of the people, he took care to
avoid all appearance of mili|tary triumph; and &s;o to re&s;train the
in&s;olence of victory, that every thing about him bore the appearance of an
e&s;tabli&s;hed monarch, making a peaceable pro|gre&s;s thro' his dominions,
rather than of a prince who had opened a way to the throne by force of arms. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His joyful re|ception in London.</NOTE> The
acclamations of the people were every whereloud, and no le&s;s &s;incere and
hearty. Be&s;ides the favour, naturally attending a young and victorious prince
on his acce&s;&s;ion, the nation promi&s;ed them&s;elves great felicity from
the new &s;cene, which opened before them. During the cour&s;e of near a whole
century the kingdom had been laid wa&s;te by dome&s;tic wars and convul&s;ions;
and if at any time the noi&s;e of arms had cea&s;ed, the &s;ound of faction and
di&s;content &s;till threatened new di&s;orders. Henry, by his marriage with
Eli|zabeth, &s;eemed to en&s;ure an union of the contending titles of their
families; and having prevailed over a hated tyrant, who had anew disjointed the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion even of the hou&s;e of York, and filled his own family with
blood, an unfeigned favour was ob&s;erved every where to attend him. Numerous
and &s;plendid troops of gentry and nobility accompanied his progre&s;s. The
mayor and companies of London received him as he approached the city: The
crouds of people and citizens were zealous in their expre&s;&s;ions of
&s;atisfaction. But Henry, amid&s;t the&s;e general effu&s;ions of joy,
di&s;covered &s;till the &s;tateline&s;s and re&s;erve of his temper, which
made him &s;corn to court popularity: He entered London in a clo&s;e chariot,
and gratified not the people with the &s;ight of their new monarch. He went
fir&s;t to St. Paul's church, where he offered up the &s;tandards, taken in the
field of battle; and &s;ung ori&s;ons for the victory, which he had there
obtained. He departed thence to the bi&s;hop of London's palace, where lodgings
were pre|pared for him.</P>
<P>BUT Henry did not &s;o much neglect the favour of the people, as
to delay giving them a&s;&s;urance of his marriage with the prince&s;s
Elizabeth, which he <PB N="6" REF="12"> knew to be &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately
de&s;ired by the whole nation. On his leaving Britanny, he had artificially
dropt &s;ome hopes, that, if he &s;hould &s;ucceed in his enterprize, and
obtain the crown of England, he would e&s;pou&s;e Anne, the heire&s;s of that
dutchy; and the report of this engagement had already reached England, and had
begot anxiety in the people, and even in the prince&s;s Elizabeth her&s;elf.
Henry took care to di&s;&s;ipate the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, by &s;olemnly
renewing, before the council and principal nobility, the promi&s;e, which he
had already given, to cele|brate his marriage with Elizabeth. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His corona|tion.</NOTE> But tho' bound by
honour, as well as intere&s;t, to compleat this alliance, he was re&s;olved to
po&s;tpone it, till the ceremony of his own coronation &s;hould be fini&s;hed,
and till his title &s;hould be recognized by the Parliament. Anxious &s;till to
&s;upport his per&s;onal and hereditary right to the throne, he dreaded le&s;t
a preceding marriage with the prince&s;s &s;hould imply a participation of
&s;overeignty in her, and rai&s;e doubts of his own title by the hou&s;e of
Lanca&s;ter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sweating &s;ick|ne&s;s.</NOTE> THERE raged at
that time in London, and other parts of the kingdom, a &s;pecies of Malady,
unknown to any other age or nation, the Sweating &s;ickne&s;s, which
occa&s;ioned a &s;udden death to great multitudes; tho' it was not propagated
by any contagious infection, but aro&s;e from the general di&s;po&s;ition of
the air and of the hu|man body. In le&s;s than twenty-four hours the patient
commonly died or recovered; but when the pe&s;tilence had committed ravages for
a few weeks, it was ob&s;erved, either from alterations in the air, or from a
more proper regimen, which was di&s;|covered, to be con&s;iderably abated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 567.</NOTE>. Preparations were then made
for the ce|remony of Henry's coronation. In order to heighten the &s;plendor of
that appearance, he be&s;towed the rank of knights banneret on twelve
per&s;ons; and he conferred peerages on three. Ja&s;per earl of Pembroke, his
uncle, he created duke of Bedford; Thomas lord Stanley, his father-in-law, earl
of Darby; and Edward Courteney, earl of Devon&s;hire. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of Oc|tober.</NOTE> At the coronation
likewi&s;e there appeared a new in&s;titution, which the king had
e&s;tabli&s;hed for &s;ecurity as well as pomp, a band of fifty archers, who
were denominated yeomen of the guard. But le&s;t the peo|ple &s;hould take
umbrage at this unu&s;ual &s;ymptom of jealou&s;y in the prince, as if it
implied a per&s;onal diffidence of his &s;ubjects, he declared the
in&s;titution to be perpe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ual. The
ceremony of coronation was performed by cardinal Bourchier, archbi&s;hop of
Canterbury.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of No|vember.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> THE Parliament being
a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter, the majority immediately appeared to be
devoted partizans of Henry; all per&s;ons of another di&s;po&s;ition, either
declining to &s;tand in the&s;e dangerous times, or being obliged to
di&s;&s;emble their principles and inclinations. The Lanca&s;trian party had
every where been <PB N="7" REF="13"> &s;ucce&s;sful in the elections; and even
many of them had been returned knights and burge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">es, who, during the prevalence of the hou&s;e of York,
had been expo&s;ed to the rigour of the law, and been condemned by &s;entence
of attainder or outlawry. Their right to take &s;eats in the hou&s;e being
que&s;tioned, the ca&s;e was referred to all the judges, who a&s;&s;embled in
the Exchequer Chamber, in order to deliberate on &s;o delicate a &s;ubject. The
&s;entence pronounced was very prudent, and con|tained a ju&s;t temperament
between law and expediency<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 581.</NOTE>. They
determined, that the members attainted &s;hould forbear taking their &s;eats
till an act were pa&s;&s;ed for the reverfal of their attainder. There was no
difficulty of obtaining this act; and in it were comprehended an hundred and
&s;even per&s;ons of the King's party<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl.
1 Hen. VII. n. 2, 3, 4.&mdash;15, 17, 26-65.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>BUT a difficulty was &s;tarted of a nature &s;till more
important. The King him|&s;elf had been attainted; and his right of
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown might thence be expo&s;ed to &s;ome doubt. The
judges extricated them&s;elves from this dangerous que&s;tion, by a &s;ingular
po&s;ition, which they e&s;tabli&s;hed; 
<Q REND="inline">"That the crown takes away all defects and
&s;tops in Blood; and that from the time the King a&s;&s;umed royal authority,
the fountain was cleared, and all attainders and cor|ruptions of blood
di&s;charged<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p 581.</NOTE>."</Q>
Be&s;ides the urgent nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, which admitted of no
deliberation; the judges probably thought, that no &s;en|tence of a court of
judicature ought to bar the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; that the jea|lou&s;y of
a King towards his heir might readily occa&s;ion &s;tretches of law and
ju&s;|tice again&s;t him; and that a prince might even be engaged in
unju&s;tifiable mea&s;ures during his predece&s;&s;or's reign, without meriting
on that account to be excluded from the throne, which was his birth-right.</P>
<P>WITH a Parliament &s;o ob&s;equious as the pre&s;ent, the King
could not fail to obtain whatever act of &s;ettlement he was plea&s;ed to
require. He &s;eems only to have entertained &s;ome doubts within him&s;elf on
what title he &s;hould found his pre|ten&s;ions. In his fir&s;t addre&s;s
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o the Parliament he mentioned his
ju&s;t title by here|ditary right: But le&s;t that title &s;hould not be
e&s;teemed &s;ufficient, he &s;ubjoined his claim by the judgment of God, who
had given him victory over his enemies in the field of battle. And again,
le&s;t this preten&s;ion &s;hould be interpreted as a&s;&s;uming a right of
conque&s;t, he en&s;ured his &s;ubjects in the entire enjoyment of their former
properties and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Entail of the crown.</NOTE> THE entail of the
crown was drawn, according to the &s;en&s;e of the King, and probably in the
words, dictated by him&s;elf. He made no mention in it of the prince&s;s
Elizabeth, nor any branch of the family of York; but in other re&s;pects the
act was compo&s;ed with &s;ufficient re&s;erve and moderation. He did not
in&s;i&s;t, that it &s;hould contain a declaration or recognition of his
preceding right; as on <PB N="8" REF="14"> the other hand, he avoided the
appearance of a new law or ordinance. He cho&s;e a middle cour&s;e, which, as
is commonly unavoidable in &s;uch ca&s;es&punc; was not en|tirely free from
uncertainty and ob&s;curity. It was voted, 
<Q REND="inline">"That the inheri|tance of the crown &s;hould
re&s;t, remain, and abide in the King<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p.
581.</NOTE>;"</Q> but whe|ther as rightful heir, or only as pre&s;ent
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, was not determined. In like manner, the King was contented
that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould be &s;ecured to the heirs of his body; but
he pretended not, in ca&s;e of their failure, to exclude the hou&s;e of York,
or give the preference to that of Lanca&s;ter: He left that great point
ambiguous for the pre&s;ent; and tru&s;ted, that, if ever its determination
&s;hould become requi&s;ite, future incidents would open the way for the
deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT after all the&s;e precautions, the King was &s;o little
&s;atisfied with his own title to the crown, that, in the following year, he
applied to Rome for a con|firmation of it; and as that court gladly laid hold
of all opportunities, which the imprudence, weakne&s;s, or nece&s;&s;ities of
princes afford it to extend its autho|rity, Innocent the eighth, the reigning
pope, readily granted a bull, in whatever terms the King was plea&s;ed to
de&s;ire. All Henry's titles, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, marriage, parliamentary
choice, even conque&s;t, are there enumerated; and to the whole the &s;anction
of religion is added; excommunication is denounced again&s;t every one who
&s;hould either di&s;turb him in the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or the heirs
of his body in their future &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown; and from this
penalty, no criminal, except in the article of death, can be ab&s;olved but by
the pope him&s;elf, or his &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ioners. It is difficult to
imagine, that the &s;ecurity derived from this bull, could be a compen&s;ation
for the defect which it betrayed in Henry's title, and to the danger of thus
inviting the pope to interpo&s;e in the&s;e concerns.</P>
<P>IT was natural, and even laudable in Henry to rever&s;e the
attainders, which had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the partizans of the hou&s;e of
Lanca&s;ter: But the revenges, which he exerci&s;ed again&s;t the retainers of
the York family, to which he was &s;o &s;oon to be allied, cannot be
con&s;idered in the &s;ame light. Yet the Parliament, at his in&s;tigation,
pa&s;&s;ed an act of attainder again&s;t the late King him&s;elf, again&s;t the
duke of Norfolk, the earl of Surrey, vi&s;count Lovel, the lords Zouche and
Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rars of Chartley, Sir Walter and
Sir James Harrington, Sir William Berkeley, Sir Humphrey Stafford, Cate&s;by,
and about twenty other gentlemen, who had fought on Richard's &s;ide in the
battle of B &s;worth. How men could be guilty of trea&s;on, by &s;upporting the
King in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t the earl of Richmond, who a&s;&s;umed not
the title of King, it was not ea&s;y to deter|mine, and nothing but a &s;ervile
complai&s;ance in the Parliament could have en|gaged them to make this
&s;tretch of ju&s;tice. Nor was it a &s;mall mortification to 
<PB N="9" REF="15"> the people in general, to find, that the King, prompted
either by avarice or re|&s;entment, could, in the very beginning of his reign,
&s;o far violate the cordial union, which had been previou&s;ly concerted
between the parties, and to the ex|pectation of which he had plainly owed his
acce&s;&s;ion to the throne.</P>
<P>THE King, having gained &s;o many points of con&s;equence from
his Parliament, thought it not expedient to demand any &s;upply from them,
which the profound peace enjoyed by the nation, and the late forfeitures of
Richard's adherents, &s;eemed to render &s;omewhat &s;uperfluous. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of De|cember.</NOTE> The Parliament,
however, conferred on him during life the duty of tonnage and poundage, which
had been enjoyed in the &s;ame manner by &s;ome of his immediate predec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ors; and they added, before they
broke up, other lucrative bills of no great moment. The King, on his part, made
&s;ome returns of grace and favour to his people. He publi&s;hed his royal
proclamation, offering pardon to all &s;uch as had taken arms, or formed any
attempts again&s;t him; provided they &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to mercy by a
certain day, and took the u&s;ual oath of fealty and allegiance. Upon this
proclamation many came out of their &s;anctuaries, and the minds of men were
every where much quieted. Henry cho&s;e to take wholly to him&s;elf the merit
of an act of grace, &s;o agreeable to the nation; rather than communicate it
with the Parliament, (as was his fir&s;t intention) by pa&s;&s;ing a bill to
that purpo&s;e. The earl of Surrey, how|ever, tho' he had &s;ubmitted, and
delivered him&s;elf into the King's hands, was &s;ent pri&s;oner to the
tower.</P>
<P>DURING this parliament, the King al&s;o be&s;towed favours and
honours on &s;ome particular per&s;ons, who were attached to him. Edward
Stafford, elde&s;t &s;on to the duke of Buckingham, forfeited in the late
reign, was re&s;tored to all the honours of his family, as well as to all its
fortune, which was very ample. This genero|&s;ity, &s;o unu&s;ual in Henry, was
the effect of his gratitude to the memory of Buckingham, who had fir&s;t
concerted the plan of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, and who by his own
ruin had made way for that great event. Chandos of Bri|tanny was created earl
of Bath, Sir Giles Daubeny lord Daubeny, and Sir Robert Willoughby lord Broke.
The&s;e were all the titles of nobility, conferred by the King<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 566.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the mini&s;ters, whom the King mo&s;t tru&s;ted and
favoured, were not cho&s;en from among the nobility, or even from among the
laity. John Morton, and Richard Fox, two clergymen, per&s;ons of indu&s;try,
vigilance, and capacity, were the men to whom he mo&s;t confided his affairs
and &s;ecret councils. They had &s;hared with him all his former dangers and
di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and he now forgot not to make them participate in his good
fortune. They were both called to the privy <PB N="10" REF="16"> council; and
Morton was created bi&s;hop of Ely, Fox of Exeter. The former &s;oon after,
upon the death of Bourchier, was rai&s;ed to the &s;ee of Canterbury. The
latter was made lord privy &s;eal; and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, bi&s;hop of Bath and
Wells, Durham, and Winche&s;ter. For Henry, as lord Bacon ob&s;erves, loved to
employ and advance prelates, becau&s;e, having rich bi&s;hoprics to be&s;tow,
it was ea&s;y for him to reward their &s;ervices: And it was his maxim to
rai&s;e them by &s;low &s;teps, and make them fir&s;t pa&s;s thro' the inferior
bi&s;hoprics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 582. Bacon adds, that the King's
rea&s;on for the&s;e gradual promotions, was in order to enjoy the more fir&s;t
fruits; not reflecting that the&s;e belonged not to the crown, till after the
reformation.</NOTE>. He probably expected, that as they were naturally more
dependant on him than the nobility, who, dur|ing that age, enjoyed
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and juri&s;dictions dangerous to royal authority; &s;o the
pro&s;pect of &s;ome farther elevation would render them &s;till more active in
his &s;ervice, and more ob&s;equious to his commands.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1486" UNIT="year"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th of Janu|ary.</NOTE> IN pre&s;enting the
bill of tonnage and poundage, the Parliament, anxious topre&s;erve the true and
undi&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, had petitioned Henry, with
demon&s;trations of the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, to e&s;pou&s;e the
prince&s;s Elizabeth; but they covered their real rea&s;on under the dutiful
pretence of their de&s;ire to have heirs of his body. He now thought in
earne&s;t of &s;atisfying the minds of his peo|ple in that particular. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's mar|riage.</NOTE> His marriage was
celebrated at London; and that with greater appearance of univer&s;al joy, than
either his fir&s;t entry or his coronation. Henry remarked with much
di&s;plea&s;ure this general favour which was borne the hou&s;e of York. The
&s;u&s;picions, which aro&s;e from it, not only di&s;turbed his tranquillity
during his whole reign; but bred di&s;gu&s;t towards his &s;pou&s;e her&s;elf,
and poy&s;oned all his dome&s;tic enjoyments. Tho' virtuous, amiable, and
ob&s;e|quious to the la&s;t degree, &s;he never met with a proper return of
affection, or even of complai&s;ance from her hu&s;band; and the malignant
ideas of faction &s;till, in his &s;ullen mind, prevailed over all the
&s;entiments of conjugal tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE King had been carried along with &s;uch a tide of
&s;ucce&s;s ever &s;ince his ar|rival in England, that he thought nothing could
with&s;tand the fortune, and au|thority which attended him. He now re&s;olved
to make a progre&s;s into the North, where the friends of the hou&s;e of York,
and even the partizans of Richard were mo&s;t numerous; in hopes of curing, by
his pre&s;ence and conver&s;ation, the prejudices of the malecontents. When he
arrived at Nottingham, he heard that vi&s;count Lovel, with Sir Humphry
Stafford and Thomas, his brother, had withdrawn them&s;elves &s;ecretly from
their &s;anctuary at Colche&s;ter: But this news appeared not to him of &s;uch
importance as to &s;top his journey; and he proceeded forward to York. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An in&s;urrec|tion.</NOTE> He there heard,
that the Staffords had levied an army in the <PB N="11" REF="17"> county of
Worce&s;ter, and were approaching to be&s;iege that city: And that Lovel, at
the head of an army of three or four thou&s;and men, was marching to attack him
in York. Henry was not di&s;mayed with this intelligence. His active cou|rage,
full of re&s;ources, immediately prompted him to find the proper remedy. Tho'
he knew him&s;elf to be &s;urrounded with enemies in the&s;e di&s;affected
counties, he a&s;&s;embled a &s;mall body of troops, in whom he could confide;
and he put them under the command of the duke of Bedford. He joined to them all
his own at|tendants; but he found that this ha&s;ty armament was more
formidable by their &s;pirit and their zealous attachment to him, than by the
arms or military &s;tores of which they were provided. He therefore gave
Bedford orders not to approach the enemy; but previou&s;ly to try every proper
expedient to di&s;&s;ipate them. Bedford publi&s;hed a general promi&s;e of
pardon to the rebels, which had a greater effect on their leader than on his
followers. Lovel, who had undertaken an enterprize, that exceeded his courage
and capacity, was &s;o terrified with the fears of de&s;ertion among his
troops, that he &s;uddenly withdrew him&s;elf, and, after lurking &s;ome time
in Lanca&s;hire, he made his e&s;cape into Flanders, where he was protected by
the dutche&s;s of Burgundy. His army &s;ubmitted to the King's clemency; and
the other in&s;urgents, hearing of this &s;ucce&s;s, rai&s;ed the &s;iege of
Worce&s;ter, and di&s;|per&s;ed them&s;elves. The Staffords took &s;anctuary in
the church of Colnham, a vil|lage near Abingdon; but as it was found, that that
church had not the privilege of giving protection to rebels, they were taken
thence: The elde&s;t Stafford was executed at Tyburn; the younger, pleading
that he was mi&s;led by his brother, obtained his pardon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 569.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">20th of Sep|tember.</NOTE> HENRY'S joy for
this &s;ucce&s;s was followed, &s;ome time after, with the birth of a prince,
to whom he gave the name of Arthur, in memory of the famous Briti&s;h King of
that name, from whom, it was pretended, the family of Tudor derived their
de&s;cent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;contents of the people.</NOTE> THO'
Henry had been able to di&s;&s;ipate that ha&s;ty rebellion, which was rai&s;ed
by the relicts of Richard's parrizans, his government was become in general
very unpopular: The &s;ource of the public di&s;content aro&s;e chiefly from
his preju|dice again&s;t the hou&s;e of York, which was univer&s;ally beloved
by the nation, and which, for that very rea&s;on, became every day more the
object of his hatred and jealou&s;y. Not only a preference on all occa&s;ions,
it was ob&s;erved, was given to the Lanca&s;trians; but many of the oppo&s;ite
party had been expo&s;ed to great &s;everity, and had been bereaved of their
fortunes by acts of attainder. A general re&s;umption likewi&s;e had pa&s;&s;ed
of all grants made by the princes of the hou&s;e of York; and tho' this rigour
had been covered under the pretence, that the revenue <PB N="12" REF="18"> was
become in&s;ufficient to &s;upport the crown, and tho' the liberalities, during
the latter years of Henry the &s;ixth, were re&s;umed by the &s;ame law, yet
the York|party, as they were the principal &s;ufferers by the re&s;umption,
thought it chiefly levelled again&s;t them. The &s;everity, exerci&s;ed
again&s;t the earl of Warwic, begot compa&s;&s;ion towards youth and innocence,
expo&s;ed to &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion; and his confinement in the tower, the very
place where Edward's children had been mur|dered by their uncle, made the
public expect a like cata&s;trophe for him, and led them to make a compari&s;on
between Henry and that dete&s;ted tyrant. And when it was remarked, that the
queen her&s;elf met with har&s;h treatment, and even after the birth of a
&s;on, was not admitted to the honour of a public coronation, Henry's
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were then concluded to be ab&s;olutely incurable, and
men became equally ob&s;tinate in their di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t his government.
Nor was the manner and addre&s;s of the King calculated to cure the&s;e
prejudices contracted again&s;t his admini&s;tration; but had, in every thing,
a tendency to promote fear, or at be&s;t reverence, rather than good will and
affection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 583.</NOTE>. And while the high
idea, en|tertained of his policy and vigour, retained the nobility and men of
character in obedience; the effects of his unpopular government &s;oon appeared
in the public, by incidents of a very extraordinary nature.</P>
<P>THERE lived in Oxford, one Richard Simon, a prie&s;t, who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;ubtlety, and &s;till more boldne&s;s and temerity.
This man had entertained the de&s;ign of di&s;turbing Henry's government, by
rai&s;ing up a pretender to his crown; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert Sim|nel.</NOTE> and for that
purpo&s;e, he ca&s;t his eyes on Lambert Simnel, a youth of fifteen years of
age, who was &s;on of a baker, and who, being endowed with under|&s;tanding
above his years, and addre&s;s above his condition, &s;eemed well fitted to
per&s;onate a prince of royal extraction. A report had been &s;pread among the
peo|ple, and received with great avidity, that Richard, duke of York, &s;econd
&s;on to Edward the fourth, had, by a &s;ecret e&s;cape, &s;aved him&s;elf from
his uncle's cruelty, and lay &s;omewhere concealed in England. Simon, taking
advantage of this rumour, had at fir&s;t in&s;tructed his pupil to a&s;&s;ume
that name, which he found to be &s;o fondly cheri&s;hed by the public: But
hearing afterwards a new report, that Warwic had made his e&s;cape from the
tower, and ob&s;erving that this news was attended with no le&s;s general
&s;atisfaction, he changed the plan of his impo&s;ture, and made Simnel
per&s;onate that unfortunate prince<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Polydore
Virgil, p. 569, 570.</NOTE>. Tho' the youth was qua|lified by nature for the
part which he was in&s;tructed to act; yet was it remarked, that he was better
informed in circum&s;tances relating to the royal family, and par|ticularly in
the adventures of the earl of Warwic, than he could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have
learned from one of Simon's condition: And it was thence conjectured, that 
<PB N="13" REF="19"> per&s;ons of higher rank, partizans of the hou&s;e of
York, had laid the plan of this con&s;piracy, and had conveyed proper
in&s;tructions to the actors. The queen dow|ager her&s;elf was expo&s;ed to
great &s;u&s;picion; and it was indeed the general opinion, however unlikely it
might &s;eem, that &s;he had &s;ecretly given her con&s;ent to this
impo&s;ture. This woman was of a very re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition. That
character of ambition and intrigue, which &s;he had betrayed during the reign
of her hu&s;band, had not abandoned her during the u&s;urpation of Richard; and
in her clo&s;et was fir&s;t laid the plan of that great confederacy, which
overturned the throne of the ty|rant, and rai&s;ed the earl of Richmond to
royal dignity. Finding, that, in&s;tead of receiving the reward of the&s;e
&s;ervices, &s;he her&s;elf was fallen to ab&s;olute in&s;ig|nificance, her
daughter treated with &s;everity, and all her friends brought under
&s;ub|jection, &s;he had conceived the mo&s;t violent animo&s;ity again&s;t
Henry, and had re|&s;olved to make him feel the effects of her re&s;entment.
The impo&s;tor, &s;he knew, however &s;ucce&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ful, it would be ea&s;y at la&s;t to &s;et a&s;ide; and if a way
could be found at his ri&s;que to &s;ubvert the King's government, &s;he hoped
that a &s;cene would be opened, which, tho' difficult at pre&s;ent exactly to
fore&s;ee, would gratify her revenge, and be on the whole le&s;s irk&s;ome to
her than that &s;lavery and contempt, to which &s;he was reduced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 570.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT whatever care Simon might take to convey in&s;truction to
his pupil, Simnel, he knew, that the impo&s;ture would not bear a cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e in&s;pection; and he was
there|fore determined to open the fir&s;t public &s;cene of it in Ireland. That
i&s;land, which was zealou&s;ly attached to the hou&s;e of York, and bore an
affectionate regard to the memory of Clarence, Warwick's father, who had been
their lieutenant, was improvidently allowed by Henry to remain in the &s;ame
condition, in which he found it; and all the councellors and officers, who had
been appointed by his pre|dece&s;&s;or, &s;till retained their authority. No
&s;ooner did Simnel pre&s;ent him&s;elf to Thomas Fitzgerald, earl of Kildare,
the deputy, and claim his protection, as the unfortunate Warwic, than that
credulous nobleman, not &s;u&s;pecting &s;o bold a fiction, lent attention to
him, and began to con&s;ult &s;ome per&s;ons of rank with regard to this
extraordinary incident. The&s;e he found even more &s;anguine in their zeal and
belief than him&s;elf: And in proportion a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;tory diffu&s;ed it&s;elf among tho&s;e of lower
condition, it became the object of &s;till higher pa&s;&s;ion and credulity;
till the people in Dublin with one con&s;ent tendered their allegiance to
Simnel as to the true Plantagenet. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of Ire|land.</NOTE> Fond of a novelty,
which flattered their natural propen|&s;ion, they overlooked the daughters of
Edward the fourth, who &s;tood before Warwic in the order of Succe&s;&s;ion;
they payed the pretended prince attendance as their &s;overeign, lodged him in
the ca&s;tle of Dublin, crowned him with a diadem taken from a &s;tatue of the
virgin, and publicly proclaimed him King, under the ap|pellation 
<PB N="14" REF="20"> of Edward the &s;ixth. The whole i&s;land followed the
example of the capital; and not a &s;word was any where drawn in Henry's
quarrel.</P>
<P>WHEN this intelligence was conveyed to Henry, it reduced him to
&s;ome per|plexity. Determined always to face his enemies in per&s;on, he yet
&s;crupled at pre|&s;ent to leave England, where he &s;u&s;pected the
con&s;piracy was fir&s;t framed, and where, he knew, many per&s;ons of
condition, and the people in general were much di&s;po&s;ed to lend it
countenance. In order to di&s;cover the &s;ecret &s;ource of the con|trivance,
and take mea&s;ures again&s;t this open revolt, he held frequent
con&s;ulta|tions with his mini&s;ters and coun&s;ellors, and laid plans for a
vigorous defence of his authority, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of his
enemies.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t event, which followed the&s;e deliberations, gave
great &s;urprize to the public: It was the &s;eizure of the queen dowager, the
forfeiture of all her lands and revenue, and the clo&s;e confinement of her
per&s;on to the nunnery of Bermon|de&s;ey. So arbitrary and violent an act of
authority was covered with a very thin pretence. It was alledged, that,
notwith&s;tanding the &s;ecret agreement to marry her daughter to Henry, &s;he
had yet yielded to the &s;ollicitations and menaces of Richard, and delivered
that prince&s;s and her &s;i&s;ters into the hands of the tyrant. This crime,
which was now become ob&s;olete, and might admit of many allevia|tions, was
therefore &s;u&s;pected not to be the real cau&s;e of the &s;everity, with
which &s;he was treated; and men believed, that the King, unwilling to accu&s;e
&s;o near a relation of a con&s;piracy again&s;t him, had cloaked his vengeance
or precaution under the pretext of an offence, known to the whole world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 583. Polydore Virgil, p. 571.</NOTE>. They were
after|wards the more confirmed in this &s;u&s;picion, when they found, that the
unfortunate queen, tho' &s;he &s;urvived this di&s;grace &s;everal years, was
never treated with any more lenity, but was allowed to end her life in poverty,
&s;olitude, and confinement. This woman had been rai&s;ed to the throne from a
very private &s;tation; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great authority during her
hu&s;band's life-time; fell afterwards into the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s; &s;aw
the murder of all her male children; had again the &s;atisfaction of
contributing to the exaltation of her daughter; an event which immediately
in|volved her in vexation, and &s;oon after in mi&s;ery: And on the whole,
&s;he furni&s;hes ample materials for reflections on the in&s;tability of
fortune; reflections, which hi&s;tory, as it relates the adventures of the
great, does more frequently &s;ugge&s;t than even the incidents of common
life.</P>
<P>THE next mea&s;ure of the King was of a le&s;s exceptionable
nature. He ordered that Warwic &s;hould be taken from the Tower, be led in
proce&s;&s;ion through the &s;treets of London, be conducted to St. Paul's, and
there expo&s;ed to the eyes of <PB N="15" REF="21"> the whole people. He even
gave directions, that &s;ome per&s;ons of condition, who were attached to the
hou&s;e of York, and were be&s;t acquainted with the per&s;on of this prince,
&s;hould approach him and conver&s;e with him: And he tru&s;ted, that the&s;e,
being convinced of the ab&s;urd impo&s;ture of Simnel, would put a &s;top to
the credulity of the people. The expedient had its effect in England: But in
Ireland the people &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in their revolt, and zealou&s;ly
retorted on the King the reproach of propagating an impo&s;ture, and of having
&s;hown a counterfeit Warwic to the people.</P>
<P>HENRY had &s;oon rea&s;on to apprehend, that the de&s;ign
again&s;t him was not laid on &s;uch &s;light foundations as the ab&s;urdity of
the contrivance &s;eemed to pro|mi&s;e. John earl of Lincoln, &s;on of John de
la Pole, duke of Suffolk, and of Elizabeth, elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter to Edward the
fourth, was engaged to take part in the con&s;piracy. This nobleman, who
po&s;&s;e&s;t capacity and courage, had entertained very a&s;piring views; and
his ambition was encouraged by the known intentions of his uncle, Richard, who
had formed a de&s;ign, in cafe him&s;elf &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue, of
declaring Lincoln &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown. The King's jealou&s;y again&s;t
all eminent per&s;ons of the York-party, and his rigour towards Warwic, had
far|ther &s;truck Lincoln with apprehen&s;ions, and made him re&s;olve to
&s;eek for &s;afety in the mo&s;t dangerous councils. Having fixed a &s;ecret
corre&s;pondence with &s;ir Thomas Broughton, a man of great intere&s;t in
Lanca&s;hire, he &s;et out for Flan|ders, where Lovel had arrived a little
before him; and he joined the court of his aunt, the dutche&s;s of Burgundy, by
whom he had been invited over.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of the dutche&s;s of
Burgundy.</NOTE> MARGARET, widow of Charles the bold, duke of Burgundy, having
born no children to her hu&s;band, attached her&s;elf with an entire
friend&s;hip to her daughter-in-law, married to Maximilian, archduke of
Au&s;tria; and after the death of that prince&s;s, &s;he per&s;evered in her
affection to Philip and Margaret, her children, and occupied her&s;elf in their
education and in the care of their per&s;ons. By her virtuous conduct and
demeanour, &s;he had acquired great authority among the Flemings; and lived
with much dignity, as well as oeconomy, upon that ample dowry, which &s;he
inherited from her hu&s;band. The re&s;entments of this prince&s;s were no
le&s;s warm than her friend&s;hips; and that &s;pirit of faction, which it is
&s;o difficult for a &s;ocial and &s;anguine temper to guard again&s;t, had
taken &s;trong po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart, and entrenched &s;omewhat on
the probity, which &s;hone forth in other parts of her character. Hearing of
the malignant jealou&s;y, entertained by Henry again&s;t her family, and his
oppre&s;&s;ion of all its partizans; &s;he was moved with the highe&s;t
indignation, and determined to make him repent of that enmity, which he
&s;eemed &s;o wantonly to court. After con&s;ulting with Lincoln 
<PB N="16" REF="22"> <MILESTONE N="1487" UNIT="year"> and Lovel, &s;he hired a
body of two thou&s;and veteran Germans, under the com|mand of Martin Swart, a
brave and experienced officer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 572,
573.</NOTE>; and &s;ent them over, together with the&s;e two noblemen, to join
Simnel in Ireland. The countenance, given by per&s;ons of &s;uch high
condition, and the acce&s;&s;ion of this military force, rai&s;ed extremely the
courage of the Iri&s;h, and made them entertain the re&s;olution of invading
England, where they believed the &s;pirit of di&s;affection to prevail as much
as it had appeared to do in Ireland. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert Sim|nel invades England.</NOTE> The
poverty al&s;o, under which they laboured, made it impo&s;&s;ible for them to
maintain any longer their new court and army, and in&s;pired them with a
&s;trong de&s;ire of enriching them&s;elves by plunder and preferment in
England.</P>
<P>HENRY was not ignorant of the&s;e intentions of his enemies; and
he prepared him&s;elf for re&s;i&s;tance. He ordered troops to be mu&s;tered in
different parts of the kingdom, and put them under the command of the duke of
Bedford, and the earl of Oxford. He confined from jealou&s;y the marquis of
Dor&s;et, who was brother to the queen regent; and who, he &s;u&s;pected, would
revenge the injuries &s;uffered by his &s;i&s;ter. And to allure the people by
an appearance of devotion, he made a pilgrimage to our lady of Wal&s;ingham,
famous for miracles; and there offered up prayers for &s;ucce&s;s and for
deliverance from his enemies.</P>
<P>BEING informed that Simnel and his forces were landed at Foudrey
in Lanca|&s;hire, he drew together his own troops, and advanced towards them as
far as Co|ventry. The rebels had entertained hopes, that the di&s;affected
counties in the North would ri&s;e in their favour: But the people, aver&s;e to
join Iri&s;h and German invaders, convinced of Lambert's impo&s;ture, and kept
in awe by the King's re|putation for &s;ucce&s;s and conduct, either remained
in tranquillity, or gave all a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the royal army. The earl of
Lincoln, therefore, who commanded the rebels, finding no hopes but in &s;peedy
victory, was determined to bring the matter to a deci&s;ion; and the King,
&s;upported by the native courage of his tem|per, and emboldened by a great
acce&s;&s;ion of volunteers, which had joined him, under the earl of
Shrew&s;bury and lord Strange, declined not the combat. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of June.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Stoke.</NOTE> The oppo&s;ite armies
met at Stoke in the county of Nottingham, and fought a battle, which was more
bloody and more ob&s;tinately di&s;puted than could have been ex|pected from
the inequality of their force. All the leaders of the rebels were re|&s;olved
to conquer or to die, and they in&s;pired their troops with a like
re&s;olution. The Germans al&s;o, being veteran and experienced &s;oldiers,
kept the victory long doubtful; and even the Iri&s;h, tho' ill-armed and
almo&s;t defencele&s;s, &s;howed them&s;elves not defective in &s;pirit and
bravery. The King's victory was purcha&s;ed <PB N="17" REF="23"> with lo&s;s,
but was entirely deci&s;ive. Lincoln, Broughton and Swart peri&s;hed in the
field of battle, with four thou&s;and of their troops. Lovel, never having been
heard of more, was believed to have undergone the &s;ame fate. Simnel with his
tutor, Simon, was taken pri&s;oner. Simon, being a prie&s;t, was not tried at
law, and was only committed to clo&s;e cu&s;tody: Simnel was too contemptible
either to ex|cite apprehen&s;ion or re&s;entment in Henry. He was pardoned, and
made a &s;cullion in the King's kitchen; whence he was afterwards advanced to
the rank of a falconer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 586. Pol. Virg. p.
574.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY had now lei&s;ure to revenge him&s;elf of his enemies. He
took a pro|gre&s;s into the northern parts, where he made the people fully
&s;en&s;ible of the rigours of his ju&s;tice. A &s;trict inquiry was made after
tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted or favoured the rebels. The puni&s;hments were
not all &s;anguinary. The King made his revenge &s;ub&s;ervient to his avarice.
Heavy fines were levied from the delin|quents. In giving &s;entence, the
proceedings of the courts, and even the courts them&s;elves, were entirely
arbitrary. Either the criminals were tried by commi&s;|&s;ioners appointed for
that purpo&s;e, or they &s;uffered puni&s;hment by &s;entence of a court
martial. And as a rumour had prevailed before the battle of Stoke, that the
rebels had gained the victory, that the King's army was cut in pieces, and that
the King him&s;elf had e&s;caped by flight, Henry was re&s;olved to interpret
the belief or propagation of this report as a mark of di&s;affection; and he
puni&s;hed many for that pretended crime. But &s;uch, in this age, was the
&s;ituation of the Engli&s;h government, that the royal prerogative, which was
but little re&s;trained during the mo&s;t peaceable periods, was &s;ure, in
tumultuous, or even &s;u&s;picious times, which frequently occurred, to break
all bounds of law and order.</P>
<P>AFTER the King had &s;atisfied his rigour by the puni&s;hment of
his enemies, he re&s;olved to give contentment to the people, in a point,
which, tho' a mere cere|mony, was very pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired by them. The
Queen had been married near two years, but had not yet been crowned; and this
affectation of delay had given great di&s;content to the public, and had been
one principal &s;ource of the di&s;affection which prevailed. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of No|vember.</NOTE> The King,
in&s;tructed by experience, now fini&s;hed the ceremony of her coronation; and
to &s;hew a &s;till more gracious di&s;po&s;ition, he gave liberty to her
uncle, the marqui&s;s of Dor&s;et, who had been able to clear him&s;elf of all
the crimes of which he was accu&s;ed.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1488" UNIT="year"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of fo|reign affairs.</NOTE> THE King
acquired great reputation throughout all Europe by the pro&s;pe|rous and
vigorous conduct of his dome&s;tic affairs; and as &s;ome incidents, about this
time, invited him to look abroad, and exert him&s;elf in behalf of his allies,
it will be nece&s;&s;ary, in order to give a ju&s;t account of his foreign
mea&s;ures, to explain the condition of the neighbouring kingdoms; beginning
with Scotland, which lies mo&s;t contiguous.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Scot|land.</NOTE> THE kingdom of
Scotland had not as yet attained that &s;tate, which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes a
civilized monarchy, and which enables the government, by the force of its laws
and in&s;titutions alone, without any extraordinary capacity in the
&s;ove|reign, to maintain it&s;elf in order and tranquillity. James the third,
who now filled the throne, was a man of little indu&s;try and of a narrow
genius; and tho' it behoved him to yield the reins of government to his
mini&s;ters, he had never been able to make any choice, which could give
contentment both to him&s;elf and to his people. When he be&s;towed his
confidence on any of the principal nobility, he found, that they exalted their
own family to &s;uch a height, as was dangerous to the prince, and gave umbrage
to the &s;tate: When he conferred favour on any per&s;on of meaner birth, on
who&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion he could more depend, the barons of his kingdom,
enraged at the power of an up&s;tart minion, proceeded to the utmo&s;t 
<PB N="19" REF="25"> extremities again&s;t their &s;overeign. Had Henry
entertained the ambition of con|que&s;ts, a tempting opportunity now offered of
reducing that kingdom to &s;ubjec|tion; but as he was probably &s;en&s;ible,
that a warlike people, tho' they might be over-run by rea&s;on of their
dome&s;tic divi&s;ions, could not be retained in obedience without a regular
military force, which was then unknown in England, he rather propo&s;ed the
renewal of the peace with Scotland, and &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to James for that
purpo&s;e. But the Scotch, who never de&s;ired a long peace with England, and
who thought that their &s;ecurity con&s;i&s;ted in pre&s;erving them&s;elves
con&s;tantly in a warlike po&s;ture, would not agree to more than a &s;even
years truce, which was accordingly concluded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polyd.
Virg. p. 575.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE European &s;tates on the continent were then ha&s;tening
fa&s;t to that &s;itua|tion, in which they have remained, without any material
alterations, for near three centuries; and began to unite them&s;elves into one
exten&s;ive &s;y&s;tem of policy, which comprehended the chief powers of
Chri&s;tendom. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Spain.</NOTE> Spain, which had
hi|thertobeen almo&s;t entirely occupied within her&s;elf, now became
formidable by the union of Arragon and Ca&s;tile, in the per&s;ons of Ferdinand
and I&s;abella, who, being princes of great capacity, employed their force in
enterprizes the mo&s;t ad|vantageous to their combined monarchy. The conque&s;t
of Granada over the Moors was then undertaken, and brought near to a happy
conclu&s;ion. And in that expedition the military genius of Spain was revived;
honour and &s;ecurity were attained; and her princes, no longer held in fear by
a dome&s;tic enemy &s;o dangerous, began to enter into all the tran&s;actions
of Europe, and make a great figure in every war and negotiation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Low Countries.</NOTE> MAXIMILIAN, King
of the Romans, &s;on to the emperor Frederic, had, by his marriage with the
heire&s;s of the hou&s;e of Burgundy, acquired an intere&s;t in the low country
provinces; and tho' the death of his &s;pou&s;e had weakened his connexion with
that territory, he &s;till pretended to the government as tutor to his &s;on
Philip, and his authority had been acknowledged by Brabant, Holland, and
&s;everal of the provinces. But as Flanders and Hainault &s;till refu&s;ed to
&s;ubmit to his regency, and even appointed other tutors to Philip, he had been
engaged in long wars again&s;t tho&s;e ob&s;tinate people, and never was able
thoroughly to &s;ubdue their &s;pirit. That he might free him&s;elf from the
oppo&s;ition of France, he had concluded a peace with Lewis the eleventh, and
had given his daughter, Marga|ret, then an infant, in marriage to the Dauphin;
together with Artois, Franche|comt&eacute;, and Charolois as her dowry. But
this alliance had not produced the de&s;ired effect. The dauphin &s;ucceeded to
the crown of France under the appel|lation <PB N="20" REF="26"> of Charles the
eighth; but Maximilian &s;till found the mutinies of the Flemings fomented by
the intrigues of the Court of France.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> FRANCE, during the
two preceding reigns, had made a mighty encrea&s;e in power and greatne&s;s;
and had not other &s;tates of Europe at the &s;ame time received an
acce&s;&s;ion of force, it had been impo&s;&s;ible to have retained her within
her an|tient boundaries. Mo&s;t of the great fiefs, Normandy, Champagne, Anjou,
Dauphiny, Guienne, Provence, and Burgundy had been united to the crown; the
Engli&s;h had been expelled from all their conque&s;ts; the authority of the
prince had been rai&s;ed to &s;uch a condition as enabled him to maintain law
and or|der; a con&s;iderable military force was kept on foot, and the finances
were able to &s;upport them. Lewis the eleventh indeed, from whom many of
the&s;e advantages were derived, was dead, and had left his &s;on, in very
early youth and ill educated, to &s;u&s;tain the weight of the monarchy: But
having entru&s;ted the government to his daughter, Anne Lady of Beaujeu, a
woman of &s;pirit and capacity, the French power &s;uffered no check or
decline. On the contrary, this prince&s;s formed the great project, which at
la&s;t &s;he happily effected, of uniting to the crown Britanny, the la&s;t and
mo&s;t independent fief of the monarchy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Britanny.</NOTE> FRANCIS the &s;econd,
duke of Britanny, was a good, but a weak prince, who, con&s;cious of his own
unfitne&s;s for government, had re&s;igned him&s;elf entirely to the direction
of Peter Landais, a man of very mean birth, more remarkable for his ability
than for his virtue or integrity. The nobles of Britanny, di&s;plea&s;ed with
the great advancement of this favourite, had even proceeded to di&s;affection
again&s;t their &s;overeign; and after many tumults and con&s;piracies, they at
la&s;t united among them&s;elves, and in a violent manner, &s;eized, tried, and
put to death the obnoxious mini&s;ter. Fearing the re&s;entment of the prince
for this inva&s;ion of his authority, many of them retired to France; and
others, for their protection and &s;afety, maintained a corre&s;pondence with
that court. The French mini&s;try, ob&s;erving the great di&s;&s;entions among
the Bretons, thought the opportunity fa|vourable for invading that dutchy; and
&s;o much the more, that they could cover their ambition under the &s;pecious
pretence of providing for dome&s;tic &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>LEWIS, duke of Orleans, fir&s;t prince of the blood, and
pre&s;umptive heir of the monarchy, had di&s;puted the admini&s;tration with
the lady of Beaujeu; and tho' his preten&s;ions had been rejected by the
&s;tates, he &s;till maintained cabals with many of the grandees, and laid
&s;chemes for &s;ubverting the authority of that prince&s;s. Finding his
&s;chemes detected, he took arms, and fortified him&s;elf in Beaugenci; but as
his revolt was precipitate, before his confederates were ready to ri&s;e with
him, he had been obliged to &s;ubmit, and to receive whatever conditions the
French mini&s;try were plea&s;ed to impo&s;e upon him. Actuated however by his
ambition, and even by his fears, he &s;oon retired out of France, and took
&s;helter with the <PB N="21" REF="27"> dexcl=Yke of Britanny, who was
de&s;irous of &s;trengthening him&s;elf again&s;t the de&s;igns of the lady of
Beaujeu by the friend&s;hip and credit of the duke of Orleans. This prince
al&s;o, ob&s;erving the a&s;cendant which he &s;oon acquired over the duke of
Bri|tanny, had engaged many of his partizans to join him at that court, and had
formed the de&s;ign of aggrandizing him&s;elf by a marriage with Anne, the
heire&s;s of that opulent dutchy.</P>
<P>THE barons of Britanny, who &s;aw all favour engro&s;&s;ed by
the duke of Orleans and his train, renewed a &s;tricter corre&s;pondence with
France, and even invited the French King to make an inva&s;ion on their
country. De&s;irous however to pre|&s;erve its independancy, they had regulated
the number of &s;uccours, which France was to &s;end, and had &s;tipulated that
no fortified place in Britanny &s;hould remain in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
that monarchy. A vain precaution, where revolted &s;ubjects treat with a power
&s;o much &s;uperior! 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">French inva|&s;ion of Bri|tanny.</NOTE> The
French invaded Britanny with forces three times more numerous than tho&s;e
which they had promi&s;ed to the barons; and advancing into the heart of the
country, laid &s;iege to Ploermel. To oppo&s;e them, the duke rai&s;ed a
numerous, but ill-di&s;ciplined army, which he put under the command of the
duke of Orleans, the count of Dunois, and others of the French nobility. The
army, di&s;contented with this choice, and jealous of their confederates,
&s;oon di&s;banded, and left their prince with too &s;mall a force to keep the
field again&s;t his invaders. He retired to Vannes; but being hotly pur&s;ued
by the French, who had made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Ploermel, he e&s;caped to
Nantz; and the enemy, having taken and garrifoned Vannes, Dinant, and other
places, laid clo&s;e &s;iege to that city. The barons of Britanny, finding
their country me|naced with total &s;ubjection, began gradually to withdraw
from the French army, and make peace with their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THIS de&s;ertion, however, of the Bretons di&s;couraged not the
court of France from pur&s;uing their favourite project of reducing Britanny to
&s;ubjection. The &s;ituation of Europe appeared very favourable to the
execution of this de&s;ign. Maximilian was engaged in clo&s;e alliance with the
duke of Britanny, and was even in treaty for marrying his daughter; but he was
on all occa&s;ions &s;o nece&s;&s;itous of money, and at that time &s;o
di&s;quieted by the mutinies of the Flemings, that little effectual
a&s;&s;i&s;tance could be expected from him. Ferdinand was entirely occupied in
the conque&s;t of Granada; and it was al&s;o known, that if Franexcl=Ye
re&s;igned to him Rou&s;illon and Cerdagne, to which he had preten&s;ions,
&s;he would at any time engage him to abandon the intere&s;ts of Britanny.
England alone was both enabled by her power, and engaged by her intere&s;ts, to
&s;upport the independency of that dutchy; and the mo&s;t dangerous
oppo&s;ition was therefore, by the French, expected from that quarter. In order
to cover their real de&s;igns, no &s;ooner were they informed 
<PB N="22" REF="28"> of Henry's &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t Simnel and his partizans,
than they di&s;patched amba&s;&s;a|dors to the court of London, and made
profe&s;&s;ions of the utmo&s;t tru&s;t and con|fidence in that monarch.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">French em|ba&s;&s;y to Eng|land.</NOTE> THE
amba&s;&s;adors, after congratulating Henry on the late victory, and
com|municating to him in the mo&s;t cordial manner, as to an intimate friend,
&s;ome &s;ucce&s;&s;es of their ma&s;ter again&s;t Maximilian, came in the
progre&s;s of their di&s;|cour&s;e to mention the late tran&s;actions in
Britanny. They told him that the duke of Britanny having given protection to
French fugitives and rebels, the King had been nece&s;&s;itated, contrary to
his intention and inclination, to carry war into that dutchy: That the honour
of the crown was intere&s;ted not to &s;uffer a va&s;&s;al &s;o far to forget
his duty to his liege lord; nor was the &s;ecurity of the government of France
le&s;s concerned to prevent the con&s;equences of this dange|rous temerity:
That the fugitives were no mean nor ob&s;cure per&s;ons; but, among others, the
duke of Orleans, fir&s;t prince of the blood, who, finding him&s;elf obnoxious
to ju&s;tice for trea&s;onable practices in France, had fled into
Bexcl=Yitanny; where he &s;till per&s;evered in laying &s;chemes of rebellion
again&s;t his &s;overeign: That the war being thus, on the part of the French
moexcl=Yarch, entirely defen&s;ive, it would immedi|ately cea&s;e, when the
duke of Britanny, by returning to his duty, &s;hould remove the cau&s;es of it:
That their ma&s;ter was &s;en&s;ible of the obligations which that duke, in
very critical times, had conferred on Henry; but it was known al&s;o, that, in
times &s;till more critical, he or his mercenary coun&s;ellors had de&s;erted
him, and put his life in the utmo&s;t hazard: That his &s;ole refuge in &s;uch
de&s;perate extremities had been the court of France, which not only protected
his per&s;on, but &s;upplied him with men and money, with which, aided by his
own valour and conduct, he had been enabled to mount the throne of England:
That France, in this tran&s;action, had, from friend&s;hip to Henry, acted
contrary to what, in a narrow view, might be e&s;teemed her own intere&s;t;
&s;ince, in&s;tead of an odious tyrant, &s;he had contributed to e&s;tabli&s;h
on a rival throne a prince endowed with &s;uch virtue and ability: And that as
both the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e and the obli|gations conferred on Henry thus
preponderated on the &s;ide of France, their ma&s;ter expected, that, if the
&s;ituation of Henry's affairs allowed him not to give a&s;&s;i&s;t|aexcl=Yce
to that kingdom, he would at lea&s;t pre&s;erve a neutrality between the
con|tending parties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 589.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;cour&s;e of the French amba&s;&s;adors was
plau&s;ible; and to give it greater weight, they communicated to Henry, as in
confidence, their ma&s;ter's intentexcl=Yon, after he &s;hould have compo&s;ed
the differences with Britanny, to lead an army into Italy, and make good his
preten&s;ions to the kingdom of Naples: A project, <PB N="23" REF="29"> which,
they knew, would give no umbrage to the court of England. But all the&s;e
artifices were in vain employed again&s;t the penetration of the King. He
clearly &s;aw, that France had entertained the view of &s;ubduing Britanny; but
he al&s;o perceived, that &s;he would meet with great, and, as he thought,
in&s;upe|rable difficulties in the execution of her project. The native force
of that dutchy, he knew, had always been con&s;iderable, and had often, without
any foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, re&s;i&s;ted the power of France; the natural
temper of the French nation, he imagined, would make them ea&s;ily abandon
every enterprize, which required per|&s;everance; and as the heir of the crown
was confederated with the duke of Britanny, the courtiers would be &s;till more
remi&s;s in pro&s;ecuting a &s;cheme which mu&s;t draw on them his re&s;entment
and di&s;plea&s;ure. Should even the&s;e internal ob&s;tructions be removed,
Maximilian, who&s;e enmity to France was well known, and who now paid his
addre&s;&s;es to the heire&s;s of Britanny, would be able to make a
di|ver&s;ion on the &s;ide of Flanders; nor could it be expected, that France,
if &s;he pro&s;ecuted &s;uch ambitious projects, would be allowed to remain in
tranquillity by Ferdinand and I&s;abella. Above all, he thought, the French
court could never expect, that England, &s;o deeply intere&s;ted to pre&s;erve
the independancy of Britanny, &s;o able by her power and &s;ituation to give
effectual and prompt a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, would permit &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ion of
force to be made to her rival. He imagined, therefore, that the mini&s;ters of
France, convinced of the impractica|bility of their &s;chemes, would at la&s;t
embrace pacific views, and would abandon an enterprize, &s;o obnoxious to all
the potentates of Europe.</P>
<P>THIS rea&s;oning of Henry was &s;olid, and might very ju&s;tly
engage him in dilatory and cautious mea&s;ures: But there entered into his
conduct another motive, which was apt to draw him beyond the ju&s;t bounds,
becau&s;e founded on a ruling pa&s;&s;ion. His frugality, which by degrees
degenerated into avarice, made him aver&s;e to all warlike enterprizes and
di&s;tant expeditions; and engaged him previou&s;ly to try the expedient of
negotiation. He di&s;patched Ur&s;wic, his almoner, a man of addre&s;s and
ability, to make offer of his mediation to the contending parties: An offer,
which, he thought, if accepted by France, would &s;oon lead to a compo&s;ure of
all differences; if refu&s;ed or eluded, would at lea&s;t di&s;cover the
per&s;everance of that court in their ambitious projects. Ur&s;wic found the
lady of Beaujeu, now dutche&s;s of Bourbon, engaged in the &s;iege of Nantz,
and had the &s;atisfaction to find that his ma&s;ter's mediation was very
readily embraced, and with many expre&s;&s;ions of confidence and moderation. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;&s;imulation of the French Court.</NOTE>
That able prince&s;s concluded, that the duke of Orleans, who governed the
court of Bri|tanny, for&s;eeing that every accommodation mu&s;t be made at his
expence, would u&s;e all his intere&s;t to have Henry's propo&s;al rejected;
and would by that means <PB N="24" REF="30"> make an effectual apology for the
French mea&s;ures, and draw on the Bretons the reproach of ob&s;tinacy and
inju&s;tice. The event ju&s;tified her prudence. When the Engli&s;h
amba&s;&s;ador made the &s;ame applications to the duke of Britanny, he
received for an&s;wer, in name of that Prince, that having &s;o long acted the
part of protector and guardian to Henry, during his youth and adver&s;ity, he
had ex|pected, from a monarch of &s;uch virtue, more effectual
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es, than a barren offer of
mediation, which &s;u&s;pended not the progre&s;s of the French arms: That if
Henry's gratitude was not &s;ufficient to engage him in &s;uch a mea&s;ure, his
prudence, as King of England, &s;hould di&s;cover to him the pernicious
con&s;equences attending the conque&s;t of Britanny, and its annexation to the
crown of France: That that kingdom, already become too powerful, would be
enabled, by &s;o great an acce&s;&s;ion of force, to di&s;play, to the ruin of
England, that ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition, which had always &s;ub&s;i&s;ted
between tho&s;e rival nations: That Britanny, &s;o u&s;eful an ally, which, by
its &s;ituation, gave the Engli&s;h an entrance into the heart of France; being
annexed to that kingdom, would be equally enabled from its &s;ituation to
di&s;turb, either by pyracies or naval arma|ments, the commerce and peace of
England: And that if the duke refu&s;ed Henry's mediation, it proceeded neither
from an inclination to a war, which he experienced to be &s;o ruinous to him,
nor from a confidence in his own force, which he knew to be &s;o much inferior
to that of the enemy; but merely from a &s;en&s;e of his pre&s;ent
nece&s;&s;ity, which mu&s;t engage the King to act the part of his confederate,
not of a mediator.</P>
<P>WHEN this an&s;wer was reported to the King, he abandoned not
the &s;y&s;tem of conduct which he had formed: He only concluded, that &s;ome
more time was requi&s;ite to quell the ob&s;tinacy of the Bretons and make them
&s;ubmit to rea&s;on. And when he learned, that the people of Britanny, anxious
for their duke's &s;afety, had formed a tumultuary army of 60,000 men, and had
obliged the French to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Nantz, he fortified him&s;elf the
more in his opinion, that the court of France would at la&s;t be reduced, by
multiplied ob&s;tacles and difficulties, to abandon the project of reducing
Britanny to &s;ubjection. He con|tinued therefore the &s;cheme of negotiation,
and thereby expo&s;ed him&s;elf to be deceived by the artifices of the French
mini&s;try; who, &s;till pretending pacific intentions, &s;ent lord Bernard
Daubigni, a Scotch man of quality, to London, and pre&s;&s;ed Henry not to be
di&s;couraged in offering his mediation to the court of Britanny. The King on
his part di&s;patched another emba&s;&s;y compo&s;ed of Ur&s;wic, the abbot of
Abingdon and Sir Richard Ton&s;tal, who carried new propo&s;als for an amicable
accommodation. No effectual &s;uccours, mean while, were provided for the
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Bretons. The lord Woodville, brother to the queen dowager, a 
<PB N="25" REF="31"> man of courage and enterprize, having a&s;ked leave to
rai&s;e underhand a body of volunteers and tran&s;port them into Britanny, met
with a refu&s;al from the King, who was de&s;irous of pre&s;erving the
appearance of a &s;trict neutrality. That noble|man, however, &s;till
per&s;i&s;ted in his intentions. He went over to the I&s;le of Wight, of which
he was governor; levied a body of 400 men; and having at la&s;t obtained, as is
&s;uppo&s;ed, the &s;ecret permi&s;&s;ion of Henry, &s;ailed with them to
Britanny. This enterprize proved fatal to the leader, and brought &s;mall
relief to the unhappy Duke. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th of July.</NOTE> The Bretons ra&s;hly
engaged in a general action with the French at St. Aubin, and were totally
di&s;comfited. Woodville and all the Eng|li&s;h were put to the &s;word;
together with a body of Bretons, who had been accouttered in the garb of
Engli&s;hmen, in order to &s;trike a greater terror into the French, to whom
the martial prowe&s;s of that nation was always formidable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Argentr&eacute; Hi&s;t. de Bretagne, Liv. 12.</NOTE>. The duke of
Orleans, the prince of Orange, and many other per&s;ons of rank were taken
pri&s;oners. And the military force of Britanny was totally di&s;&s;ipated. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th Septem|ber.</NOTE> The death of the duke,
which followed &s;oon after, threw affairs into &s;till greater confu&s;ion,
and &s;eemed to threaten the &s;tate with a final &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>THO' the King prepared not again&s;t the&s;e events, &s;o
hurtful to the intere&s;t of England, with &s;ufficient vigour and precaution,
he had not altogether over|looked them. Determined to ob&s;erve a pacific
conduct, as far as the &s;ituation of affairs would permit, he yet knew the
warlike di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;ubjects, and ob&s;erved, that their antient
and inveterate animo&s;ity to France was now revived by the pro&s;pect of this
great acce&s;&s;ion to its power and grandeur. He re&s;olved therefore to make
advantage of tho&s;e humours, and to draw &s;ome &s;upplies of money from the
people, under pretext of giving a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Duke of Bri|tanny. He
had &s;ummoned a Parliament to meet at We&s;tmin&s;ter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">9th November, 1487.</NOTE>; and he &s;oon per&s;waded them to
grant him a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Polydore
Virgil, p. 579, &s;ays that this impo&s;ition was a capitation tax; the other
hi&s;torians &s;ay it was a tax of two &s;hillings on the pound.</NOTE>. But
this &s;upply, tho' voted by Parliament, involved the King in unexpected
difficulties. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An in&s;urrec|tion in the North.</NOTE> The
counties of Durham and York, always di&s;contented with Henry's government, and
far|ther provoked by the late oppre&s;&s;ions, under which they had laboured,
after the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of Simnel's rebellion, re&s;i&s;ted the
commi&s;&s;ioners who were ap|pointed to levy the new tax. The
commi&s;&s;ioners, terrified with this appear|ance of &s;edition, made
application to the Earl of Northumberland, and de&s;ired of him advice and
a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the execution of their office. That nobleman thought the
matter of importance enough to con&s;ult the King; who, unwilling to yield to
the humours of a di&s;contented populace, and fore&s;eeing the per|nicious 
<PB N="26" REF="32"> con&s;equences of &s;uch a precedent, renewed his orders
for a &s;trict levy of the impo&s;ition. Northumberland &s;ummoned together the
ju&s;tices and chief free|holders, and delivered the King's commands in the
mo&s;t imperious terms, which, he thought, would inforce obedience, but which
tended only to provoke the people, and make them believe him the advi&s;er of
tho&s;e orders which he de|livered to them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 595.</NOTE>. They flew to arms, and attacked
Northumberland's hou&s;e, whom they put to death. Having incurred &s;uch deep
guilt, their mutinous humour prompted them to declare again&s;t the King
him&s;elf; and being in&s;tigated by one John Achamber, a &s;editious fellow of
mean birth, they cho&s;e Sir John Egre|mond their leader, and prepared
them&s;elves for a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance. Henry was not di&s;mayed with an
in&s;urrection &s;o precipitant and ill &s;upported. He immediately levied a
force which he put under the command of the earl of Sur|rey, whom he had
delivered from confinement, and re&s;tored to his favour. His intention was to
&s;end down the&s;e troops, in order to check the progre&s;s of the rebels;
while he him&s;elf &s;hould follow with a greater body, which would
ab&s;o|lutely in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. But Surrey thought him&s;elf &s;trong
enough to encounter a raw and unarmed multitude; and he &s;ucceeded in the
attempt. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppre&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> The rebels were
di&s;&s;ipated; John Achamber taken pri&s;oner, and afterwards executed with
&s;ome of his accomplices; Sir John Egremond fled to the dutche&s;s of
Burgundy, who gave him protection; the greater number of the rebels received
their pardon.</P>
<P>HENRY had probably expected, when he obtained this grant from
the Par|liament, that he would be able to terminate the affair of Britanny by
negotiation, and that he might thereby fill his coffers with the money levied
by the impo&s;ition. But as the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Bretons &s;till
multiplied, and became every day more ur|gent; he found him&s;elf under the
nece&s;&s;ity of taking &s;ome mea&s;ures, in order to &s;up|port them. On the
death of the duke, the French had revived &s;ome antiquated claims to the
dominion of the dutchy; and as the duke of Orleans was now captive in France,
their former pretext for ho&s;tilities could no longer &s;erve as a cover to
their ambition. The King re&s;olved therefore to engage as auxiliary to
Britanny; and to con&s;ult the intere&s;t, as well as de&s;ires of his people,
by op|po&s;ing him&s;elf to the progre&s;s of the French power. Be&s;ides
entering into a league with Maximilian, and another with Ferdinand, which were
di&s;tant re|&s;ources, he levied a body of troops, to the number of 6000 men,
with an in|tention of tran&s;porting them into Britanny.
<MILESTONE N="1489" UNIT="year"> Still anxious, however, for the pay|ment of
his expences, he concluded a treaty with the young dutch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s, by which &s;he was engaged to deliver into his
hands two &s;ea-port towns, there to remain till &s;he &s;hould entirely refund
the charges of the armament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Tillet, Recueil des

intere&s;t to protect her. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">King &s;end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> forces into Britanny.</NOTE> The forces arrived under the command
of lord Willoughby of Broke; and made the Bretons, during &s;ome time,
ma&s;ters of the field. The French retired into their garri&s;ons; and
propo&s;ed by dilatory mea&s;ures to wa&s;te the fire of the Engli&s;h, and
di&s;gu&s;t them with their enterprize. The &s;cheme was well laid, and met
with &s;ucce&s;s. Lord Broke found &s;uch di&s;cord and confu&s;ion in the
councils of Bri|tanny, that no mea&s;ures could be concerted for any
undertaking; no &s;upply ob|tained; no provi&s;ions, carriages, ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">illery, or military &s;tores procured.
The whole court was rent into factions: No one mini&s;ter had acquired the
a&s;cendant: And whatever project was formed by one, was &s;ure to be
traver&s;ed by another. The Engli&s;h, di&s;concerted in every enterprize, by
the&s;e animo&s;ities and uncertain councils, returned home as &s;oon as the
time of their &s;ervice was elap&s;ed; leaving only a &s;mall garri&s;on in
tho&s;e towns which had been put into their hands. During their &s;tay in
Britanny, they had done nothing but contributed &s;till far|ther to wa&s;te the
country; and by their departure, they left it entirely at the mercy of the
enemy. So feeble was the &s;uccour, which Henry in this impor|tant conjuncture
afforded his ally, whom the inva&s;ion of a foreign enemy, concur|ring with
dome&s;tic di&s;&s;en&s;ions, had reduced to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>THE great object of di&s;&s;en&s;ion among the Bretons was the
di&s;po&s;al of the young dutche&s;s in marriage. The mare&s;chal Rieux
&s;econded the &s;uit of the lord Albert, who led &s;ome forces to her
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The chancellor Montauban, ob&s;erving the aver&s;ion of the
dutche&s;s to this &s;uitor, in&s;i&s;ted, that a petty prince, &s;uch as
Al|bert, was unable to &s;upport Anne in her pre&s;ent extremities; and he
recommended &s;ome more powerful alliance, particularly that of Maximilian,
King of the Ro|mans. <MILESTONE N="1490" UNIT="year"> This party at la&s;t
prevailed; the marriage with Maximilian was celebrated by proxy; and the
dutche&s;s thenceforth a&s;&s;umed the title of queen of the Ro|mans. But this
magnificent appellation was all &s;he gained by her marriage. Maximili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n, de&s;titute of troops and money, and embarra&s;&s;ed
with the continual revolts of the Flemings, could give no a&s;&s;i&s;tance to
his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed con&s;ort: While Albert, enraged at the preference given
his rival, de&s;erted her cau&s;e, and received the French into Nantz, the
mo&s;t important place in the dutchy, both for &s;trength and riches.</P>
<P>THE French court began now to change their &s;cheme with regard
to the &s;ub|ject on of Britanny. Charles had formerly been a&s;&s;ianced to
Margaret daughter of Maximilian; who, tho' too young to con&s;ummate her
marriage, had been <PB N="28" REF="34"> &s;ent to Paris to be educated, and
bore at this time the title of queen of France. Be&s;ides the rich dowry, which
&s;he brought the King, &s;he was, after her brother, Philip, then in early
youth, heire&s;s to the whole dominions of the hou&s;e of Bur|gundy; and
&s;eemed in many re&s;pects the mo&s;t proper match, which could be cho&s;en
for the young monarch. The&s;e circum&s;tances had &s;o blinded the councils
both of Maximilian and Henry, that they never &s;u&s;pected any other
intentions in the French court; nor were able to di&s;cover, that engagements,
&s;o advantageous and &s;o &s;olemnly entered into, could be infringed and
&s;et a&s;ide. But Charles be|gan to perceive, that the conque&s;t of Britanny,
in oppo&s;ition to the natives, and to all the great powers in Chri&s;tendom,
would prove a very difficult enterprize; and that even, if he &s;hould over-run
the country and make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the fortre&s;&s;es, it would be
impo&s;&s;ible for him long to retain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. The marriage
alone of the dutche&s;s could fully re-annex that fief to the crown; and the
pre&s;ent and certain enjoyment of &s;o con&s;iderable a territory &s;eemed
preferable to the pro&s;pect of inheriting the dominions of the hou&s;e of
Burgundy; a pro|&s;pect which became every day more di&s;tant and precarious.
Above all, the marriage of Maximilian and Anne appeared de&s;tructive to the
grandeur and even &s;ecurity of the French monarchy; while that prince &s;hould
po&s;&s;e&s;s Flanders on the one hand, and Britanny on the other, and might
thus from both quarters make inroads into the heart of the country. The only
remedy for the&s;e evils was therefore concluded to be the di&s;&s;olution of
the two marriages, which had been celebrated, but not con&s;ummated; and the
e&s;pou&s;als of the dutche&s;s of Britanny, and the King of France.</P>
<P>THIS expedient, which had not been fore&s;een by any court of
Europe, and which they were, all of them, &s;o much engaged in point of
intere&s;t to oppo&s;e, it was requi&s;ite to keep a profound &s;ecret, and
only to di&s;cover to the world by the full execution of it. The mea&s;ures of
the French mini&s;try were in the conduct of this delicate enterprize very
wi&s;e and political. While they pre&s;&s;ed Britanny with all the rigours of
war, they &s;ecretly gained the count of Dunois, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great
authority with the Bretons; and having al&s;o engaged in their intere&s;ts the
prince of Orange, cou&s;in-german to the dutche&s;s, they gave him his liberty,
and &s;ent him into Britanny. The&s;e per&s;ons, &s;upported by other
emi&s;&s;aries of France, prepared the minds of men for the great revolution
projected, and di&s;played, tho' &s;till with many precautions, all the
advantages of an union with the French monarchy. They repre&s;ented to the
Briti&s;h barons, that their country, harra&s;&s;ed during &s;o many years with
perpetual war, had need of &s;ome repo&s;e, and of a &s;olid and la&s;ting
peace with the only power that was formidable to them: That their alliance with
Maximilian was not able to afford them even pre&s;ent protection; and by 
<PB N="29" REF="35"> uniting them clo&s;ely with a power, which was rival to
the greatne&s;s of France, fixed them in perpetual enmity with that powerful
monarchy: That their near neighbourhood expo&s;ed them fir&s;t to the inroads
of the enemy; and the happie&s;t event, which in &s;uch a &s;ituation could
befal them, would be to attain peace, tho' by a final &s;ubjection to France,
and by the lo&s;s of that liberty, tran&s;mitted them from their ance&s;tors:
And that any other expedient, compatible with the honour of the &s;tate, and
their duty to their &s;overeign, was preferable to a &s;cene of &s;uch
di&s;order and deva&s;tation.</P>
<P>THESE &s;ugge&s;tions had influence on the Bretons: But the
chief difficulty lay in &s;urmounting the prejudices of the young dutche&s;s
her&s;elf. That prince&s;s had imbibed in her education a &s;trong prejudice
again&s;t the French nation, and par|ticularly again&s;t Charles, who had been
the author of all the calamities, which, from her earlie&s;t infancy, had
befallen her family. She had al&s;o fixed her affec|tions on Maximilian; and as
&s;he now deemed him her hu&s;band, &s;he could not, &s;he thought, without
incurring the greate&s;t guilt, and violating the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements,
contract a marriage with another per&s;on. <MILESTONE N="1491" UNIT="year"> In
order to overcome her ob&s;tinacy, Charles gave the duke of Orleans his
liberty, who, tho' formerly a &s;uitor of the dutche&s;s, was now contented to
ingratiate him&s;elf with the King, by employing in his favour all the
intere&s;t which he &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Britanny. The mare&s;chal
Rieux and chancellor Montauban were reconciled by his negoti|ations; and
the&s;e rival mini&s;ters now concurred with the prince of Orange, and the
count of Dunois, in pre&s;&s;ing the conclu&s;ion of a marriage with Charles.
From their &s;ugge&s;tion, Charles advanced with a powerful army and inve&s;ted
Rennes, at that time the re&s;idence of the dutche&s;s; who, a&s;&s;ailed on
all hands, and finding none to &s;upport her in her inflexibility, at la&s;t
opened the gates of the city, and agreed to e&s;pou&s;e the King of France. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annexation of Britanny to France.</NOTE> She
was married at Langey in Touraine; conducted to St. Denis, where &s;he was
crowned; and thence made her entry into Paris, amid&s;t the joyful acclamations
of the people, who regarded this marriage as the mo&s;t pro&s;perous event that
could have befallen their monarchy.</P>
<P>THE triumph and &s;ucce&s;s of Charles was the mo&s;t
&s;en&s;ible mortification to the King of the Romans. He had lo&s;t a
con&s;iderable territory, which he thought he had acquired, and an
accompli&s;hed prince&s;s whom he had e&s;pou&s;ed; he was affronted in the
per&s;on of his daughter Margaret, who was &s;ent back to him, after being
treated during &s;ome years as queen of France; he had rea&s;on to re|proach
him&s;elf with his own &s;upine &s;ecurity, in neglecting the con&s;ummation of
his marriage, which was ea&s;ily practicable for him, and which would have
ren|dered <PB N="30" REF="36"> the tye indi&s;&s;oluble: The&s;e
con&s;iderations threw him into the mo&s;t violent rage, which he vented in
very indecent expre&s;&s;ions; and he threatened France with an inva&s;ion from
the united arms of Au&s;tria, Spain, and England.</P>
<P>THE King of England had al&s;o ju&s;t rea&s;on to reproach
him&s;elf with mi&s;con|duct in this important tran&s;action; and tho' the
affair had terminated in a manner which he could not preci&s;ely fore&s;ee, his
negligence, in leaving &s;o long his mo&s;t u&s;eful&punc; ally expo&s;ed to
the inva&s;ion of &s;uperior power, could not but appear on reflection the
re&s;ult of timid caution and narrow politics. As he valued him&s;elf very much
on his exten&s;ive fore&s;ight and profound judgment, the a&s;cendant ac|quired
over him, by a raw youth, &s;uch as Charles, could not but give him the
highe&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, and prompt him to &s;eek vengeance, after all remedy
for his mi&s;carriage was become ab&s;olutely impracticable. But he was farther
actuated by avarice, a motive &s;till more predominant with him than either
pride or re|venge; and he &s;ought even from his pre&s;ent di&s;appointments,
the gratification of this ruling pa&s;&s;ion. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th July.</NOTE> Under pretext of a French
war, he i&s;&s;ued a commi&s;&s;ion for levying a <HI>Benevolence</HI> on his
people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, Vol. XII. p. 446. Bacon &s;ays that the
benevolence was levied with con&s;ent of Parlia|ment, which is a
mi&s;take.</NOTE>; an arbitrary taxation, which had been aboli&s;hed by a
recent law of Richard the third, and which was the more provok|ing, that, tho'
really rai&s;ed by menaces and extortion, it was neverthele&s;s pre|tended to
be given by the voluntary con&s;ent of the people. This violence fell chiefly
on the commercial part of the nation, who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the ready
money. London alone contributed to the amount of near 10,000 pounds.
Arch|bi&s;hop Morton, the chancellor, in&s;tructed the commi&s;&s;ioners to
employ a dilemma, in which every one might be comprehended: If the per&s;ons
applied to lived frugal|ly, they were told, that their par&s;imony mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily have enriched them: If their method of living was &s;plendid
and ho&s;pitable, they were concluded opulent on account of their expences.
This device was by &s;ome called chancellor Mor|ton's fork, and by others his
crutch.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">27th October.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> SO little apprehen&s;ive
was the King of a Parliament, on account of his levy|ing this arbitrary
impo&s;ition, that he &s;oon after &s;ummoned that a&s;&s;embly to meet at
We&s;tmin&s;ter; and he even expected to enrich him&s;elf farther by working on
their pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices. He knew the re&s;entment, which the
Engli&s;h had con|ceived again&s;t France, by rea&s;on of the conque&s;t of
Britanny; and he took care to in&s;i&s;t on that topic, in the &s;peech, which
he him&s;elf pronounced to the Parliament. He told them, that France, elevated
with her late &s;ucce&s;&s;es, had even proceeded to a cont mpt of England, and
had refu&s;ed to pay that tribute, which Lewis the eleventh had &s;tipulated to
Edward the fourth: That it became &s;o warlike a <PB N="31" REF="37"> nation as
the Engli&s;h to be rouzed with this indignity, and not to limit their
preten&s;ions merely to repre&s;&s;ing the pre&s;ent injury: That for his part,
he was determined to lay claim to the crown of France it&s;elf, and to maintain
by force of arms &s;o ju&s;t a title tran&s;mitted to him by his gallant
ance&s;tors: That Cre&s;&s;y, Poictiers, and Agincourt were &s;ufficient to
in&s;truct them in their &s;uperiority over the enemy; nor did he de&s;pair of
adding new names to the glorious catalogue: That a King of France had been
pri&s;oner at London, and a King of England had been crowned at Paris; events
which &s;hould animate them to an emulation of like glory with that enjoyed by
their forefathers: That the dome&s;tic di&s;&s;en&s;ions of England had been
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">le cau&s;e of her lo&s;ing
the&s;e foreign dominions; and her pre&s;ent union and harmony would be the
effectual means of recovering them: That where &s;uch la&s;ting honour was in
view, and &s;uch an important acqui&s;ition, it became not brave men to repine
at the advance of a little trea&s;ure: And that for his part, he was determined
to make the war maintain it&s;elf, and hoped, by the inva&s;ion of &s;o opulent
a kingdom as France, to encrea&s;e, rather than dimini&s;h, the riches of the
nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 601.</NOTE></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1492" UNIT="year"> NOTWITHSTANDING the&s;e
magnificent vaunts of the King, all men of pene|tration concluded, from the
per&s;onal character of the man, and &s;till more, from the &s;ituation of his
affairs, that he had no &s;erious intention of pu&s;hing the war to &s;uch
extremity as he pretended. France was not now in the &s;ame condition as when
&s;uch &s;ucce&s;sful inroads had been made into her by the former Kings of
England. The great fiefs were united to the crown; the princes of the blood
were de&s;irous of peace and tranquility; the kingdom abounded with able
cap|tains and veteran &s;oldiers; and the general a&s;pect of its affairs
&s;eemed more to threaten its neighbours, than to &s;ubject it to any in&s;ults
from them. The levity and vain glory of Maximilian were &s;upported by his
pompous titles; but were ill &s;econded by military power, and &s;till le&s;s,
by any revenue, proportioned to them. The politic Ferdinand, while he made a
&s;how of war, was actually nego|tiating for peace; and rather than expo&s;e
him&s;elf to any hazard, would accept of very moderate conce&s;&s;ions from
France. Even England was not free from do|me&s;tic di&s;contents; and in
Scotland, the death of Henry's friend and ally, James the third, who had been
murdered by his rebellious &s;ubjects, had made way for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
his &s;on, James the fourth, who was devoted to the French intere&s;t, and
would &s;urely be alarmed with any progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h arms. But all
the&s;e obvious con&s;iderations had no influence with the Parliament. Inflamed
by the ideas of &s;ubduing France, and of inriching them&s;elves with the
&s;poils of that <PB N="32" REF="38"> kingdom, they gave into the &s;nare
prepared for them, and voted the &s;upply which the King demanded. Two
fifteenths were granted him; and the better to enable his va&s;&s;als and
nobility to attend him, an act was pa&s;&s;ed, empowering them to &s;ell their
e&s;tates, without paying any fines for alienation.</P>
<P>THE nobility were univer&s;ally &s;eized with a de&s;ire of
military glory; and hav|ing credulou&s;ly &s;wallowed all the boa&s;ts of the
King, they dreamed of no le&s;s than carrying their triumphant arms to the
gates of Paris, and putting the crown of France on Henry's head. Many of them
borrowed large &s;ums or &s;old off manors, that they might appear in the field
with greater &s;plendour, and lead out their followers in more compleat order. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> The king cro&s;&s;ed
the &s;eas, and arrived at Calais on the &s;ixth of October, with an army of
twenty-five thou&s;and foot and &s;ixteen hundred hor&s;e, which he put under
the command of the duke of Bedford and the earl of Oxford: But as &s;ome
inferred, from his opening the campaign in &s;o late a &s;ea&s;on, that peace
would &s;oon be concluded between the crowns, he was de&s;irous of
&s;ugge&s;ting a contrary inference. 
<Q REND="inline">"He had come over," he &s;aid, "to make an
entire conque&s;t of France, which was not the work of one &s;ummer. It was
therefore of no con&s;equence at what &s;ea&s;on he began the inva&s;ion;
e&s;pe|cially as he had Calais ready for winter quarters."</Q> As if he had
&s;eriou&s;ly in|tended this enterprize, he in&s;tantly marched with his army
into the enemy's coun|try, and laid &s;iege to Bulloigne: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion of France.</NOTE> But
notwith&s;tanding this appearance of a ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition, there had
been &s;ecret advances made towards a peace above three months before; and
commi&s;&s;ioners had been appointed to treat of the terms. The better to
reconcile the minds of men to this unexpected mea&s;ure, the king's
amba&s;&s;adors arrived in the camp from the Low Countries, and informed him,
that Maximilian was in no readine&s;s to join him; nor was any a&s;&s;i&s;tance
to be hoped for from that quarter. Soon after, me&s;&s;engers came from Spain,
and brought news of a peace concluded between that kingdom and France, in which
Charles had made a ce&s;&s;ion of the counties of Rou&s;&s;illon and Cerdagne
to Ferdinand. Tho' the&s;e articles of intelligence were carefully
di&s;per&s;ed thro' the army, the King was &s;till apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t a
&s;udden peace, after &s;uch magnificent promi&s;es and high expectations,
would expo&s;e him to great reproach. That he might more effectually cover the
intended mea&s;ures, he &s;ecretly engaged the marqui&s;s of Dor|&s;et,
together with twenty three per&s;ons of condition, to pre&s;ent him a petition
for his agreeing to a treaty with France. The pretence was founded on the late
&s;ea|&s;on of the year, the difficulty of &s;upplying the army at Calais
during winter, the ob&s;tacles which aro&s;e in the &s;iege of Bulloigne, the
de&s;ertion of tho&s;e allies who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance had been mo&s;t relied
on: Events which might, all of them, have been fore&s;een before the
embarkation of the forces.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="39"> IN con&s;equence of the&s;e preparatory
&s;teps, the bi&s;hop of Exeter and the lord Daubeney were &s;ent to confer at
E&s;taples with the mare&s;chal of Cordes, and to put the la&s;t hand to the
treaty. A few days &s;ufficed for this purpo&s;e: The demands of Henry were
wholly pecuniary; and the King of France, who e&s;teemed the peaceable
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Britanny an equivalent for any money, and who was all on
fire for his projected expedition into Italy, readily agreed to the propo&s;als
made him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of No|vember.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France.</NOTE> He engaged to pay
Henry &s;even hundred and forty-five thou&s;and crowns, about one hundred and
eighty-&s;ix thou&s;and two hundred and fifty pounds &s;terling; partly as a
reimbur&s;ement of the &s;ums advanced for Britanny, partly as arrears of the
pen&s;ion due to Edward the fourth. And he &s;tipulated a yearly pen&s;ion to
Henry and his heirs of twenty-five thou&s;and crowns. Thus the King, as
remarked by his hi&s;torian, made profit upon his &s;ubjects for the war; and
upon his enemies for the peace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 605. Pol.
Virg. p. 586.</NOTE>. And the people agreed, that he had fulfilled his
promi&s;e, when he &s;aid to the parliament, that he would make the war
maintain it&s;elf. Maximilian was comprehended in Henry's treaty, if he
plea&s;ed to accept of it; but he di&s;dained to be in any re&s;pect beholden
to an ally, of whom, he thought, he had rea&s;on to complain: He made a
&s;eparate peace with France, and obtained re&s;titution of Artois,
Franchecomte and Charolois, which had been given as the dowry of his daughter,
when &s;he was affianced to the King of France.</P>
<P>THE peace, concluded between England and France, was the more
likely to continue, that Charles, full of ambition and youthful hopes, bent all
his atten|tion to the &s;ide of Italy, and &s;oon after undertook the
conque&s;t of Naples; an enterprize, which Henry regarded with the greater
indifference, that Naples lay remote from him, and France had never, in any
age, been &s;ucce&s;sful on that quarter. The King's authority was fully
e&s;tabli&s;hed at home; and every rebellion, which had been attempted
again&s;t him, had hitherto tended only to confound his enemies, and
con&s;olidate his power and influence. His reputation for policy and conduct
was every day augmenting; his trea&s;ures had encrea&s;ed even from the mo&s;t
unpro&s;perous events; the hopes of all pretenders to his throne were cut off,
as well by his marriage, as by the i&s;&s;ue which it had brought him. In this
pro|mi&s;ing &s;ituation, the King had rea&s;on to flatter him&s;elf with the
pro&s;pect of a durable peace and tranquillity: But his inveterate and
indefatigable enemies, whom he had wantonly provoked, rai&s;ed up to him an
adver&s;ary, who kept him long in inquietude, and &s;ometimes even brought him
into danger.</P>
<P>THE dutche&s;s of Burgundy, full of re&s;entment for the
depre&s;&s;ion of her family and its partizans, rather irritated than
di&s;couraged with the bad &s;ucce&s;s of her pa&s;t <PB N="34" REF="40">
enterprizes, was determined at lea&s;t to di&s;turb that government, which
&s;he found it &s;o difficult to &s;ubvert. By means of her emi&s;&s;aries,
&s;he propagated the report, that her nephew, Richard Plantagenet, duke of
York, had e&s;caped&punc; from the Tower when his elder brother was murdered,
and that he lay &s;till &s;omewhere concealed: And finding this rumour, however
improbable, to be greedily re|ceived by the people, &s;he had been looking out
for &s;ome young man, proper to per&s;onate that unfortunate prince.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perkin War|bec.</NOTE> THERE was one O&s;bec
or Warbec, a renegado Jew of Tournay, who had been carried by &s;ome
bu&s;ine&s;s to London in the reign of Edward the fourth, and had there a &s;on
born to him. Having had opportunities of being known to the King, and obtaining
his favour, he prevailed with that prince, who&s;e manners were very affable,
to &s;tand godfather to his &s;on, to whom he gave the name of Peter,
cor|rupted after the Flemi&s;h manner into Peter-kin, or Perkin. It was by
&s;ome be|lieved, that Edward, among his other amorous adventures, had had a
&s;ecret corre&s;pondence with Warbec's wife; and from this incident people
accounted for that re&s;emblance, which was afterwards remarked between young
Perkin and that monarch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 606.</NOTE>. Some
years after the birth of this child, Warbec returned to Tour|nay; where Perkin
his &s;on remained not long, but by different accidents was car|ried from place
to place, and his birth and fortunes became thereby unknown, and difficult to
be traced by the mo&s;t careful enquiry. The variety of his adven|tures had
happily favoured the natural ver&s;atility and &s;agacity of his genius; and he
&s;eemed to be a youth perfectly fitted to act any part, or a&s;&s;ume any
character. In this light he had been repre&s;ented to the dutche&s;s of
Burgundy, who, &s;truck with the concurrence of &s;o many circum&s;tances
&s;uited to her purpo&s;e, de&s;ired to be made acquainted with the per&s;on,
on whom &s;he began already to ground her hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His impo&s;ture.</NOTE> She found him to
exceed her mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations; &s;o beautiful did he appear in his
per&s;on, &s;o graceful in his air, &s;o courtly in his ad|dre&s;s, &s;o full
of docility and good &s;en&s;e in his behaviour and conver&s;ation. The
le&s;&s;ons, which were nece&s;&s;ary to be taught him, in order to his
per&s;onating the duke of York, were &s;oon learned by a youth of &s;uch quick
comprehen&s;ion; but as the &s;ea&s;on &s;eemed not then favourable for his
enterprize, Margaret, in order the better to conceal him, &s;ent him, under the
care of Lady Brampton, into Por|tugal, where he remained a year, unknown to all
the world.</P>
<P>THE war, which was then ready to break out between France and
England, &s;eemed to afford a proper opportunity for the di&s;covery of this
new phaenomenon; and Ireland, which &s;till retained its attachments to the
hou&s;e of York, was pitched on as the proper place for his fir&s;t
appearance<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 589.</NOTE>. He
landed at Corke; and im|mediately <PB N="35" REF="41"> a&s;&s;uming the name of
Richard Plantagenet, drew to him partizans among that ignorant and credulous
people. He wrote letters to the earls of De&s;|mond and Kildare, inviting them
to join his party: He di&s;per&s;ed every where the &s;trange intelligence of
his e&s;cape from his uncle Richard's cruelty; and men, fond of every thing new
and wonderful, began to make him the general &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e,
and even the object of their favour.</P>
<P>THE news &s;oon reached France; and Charles, prompted by the
private &s;ollici|tations of the dutche&s;s of Burgundy, and the intrigues of
one Frion, a &s;ecretary of Henry, who had de&s;erted his &s;ervice, &s;ent
Perkin an invitation to repair to him at Paris. He received him with all the
marks of regard due to the duke of York; &s;ettled on him a hand&s;ome
pen&s;ion, a&s;&s;igned him magnificent lodgings, and in order to provide at
once for his dignity and &s;ecurity, gave him a guard for his per&s;on, of
which lord Congre&s;all accepted the office of captain. The French courtiers
readily embraced a fiction, which their &s;overeign thought it his intere&s;t
to adopt: Perkin, both by his deportment and per&s;on, &s;upported the
prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, which was &s;pread abroad of his royal pedigree: And
the whole kingdom was full of the accompli&s;hments, as well as &s;ingular
adventures and misfortunes, of the young Plantagenet. Wonders of this nature
are commonly augmented at a di&s;tance. From France, the admiration and
credulity diffu&s;ed them&s;elves into Eng|land: Sir George Neville, Sir John
Taylor, and a hundred gentlemen more came to Paris, in order to offer their
&s;ervice to the &s;uppo&s;ed duke of York, and to &s;hare his fortunes: And
the impo&s;tor had now the appearance of a court at|tending him, and began to
entertain hopes of final &s;ucce&s;s in his undertakings.</P>
<P>WHEN peace was concluded between France and England at
E&s;taples, Henry applied to have Perkin put into his hands; but Charles,
re&s;olute not to betray a young man, of whatever birth, whom he had invited
into his kingdom, would agree only to di&s;mi&s;s him. The pretended
Plantagenet retired to the dutche&s;s of Burgundy in Flanders, and craving her
protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, offered to lay before her all the proofs of
that birth, to which he laid claim.

embraced him as her nephew, the true image of Edward, the &s;ole heir of the
Plantagenets, and the legitimate &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the Engli&s;h throne. She
imme|diately <PB N="36" REF="42"> <MILESTONE N="1493" UNIT="year">

England.</HI> The Flemings, moved by the authority, which Margaret, both from
her rank and per&s;onal character, enjoyed among them, readily adopted the
fiction of Perkin's royal de&s;cent: No &s;urmize of his true birth was as yet

Engli&s;h, from their great communication with the natives of the Low

<P>IT was not the populace alone of England, that gave credit to
Perkin's preten|&s;ions. Men of the highe&s;t birth and quality, di&s;gu&s;ted
with Henry's government, by which they found the nobility depre&s;&s;ed, began

by the dutche&s;s of Burgundy to his acquaintance. Clifford wrote back to
Eng|land, that he knew perfectly the per&s;on of Richard duke of York, that
this young man was undoubtedly that prince him&s;elf, and that no
circum&s;tance of his &s;tory was expo&s;ed to the lea&s;t difficulty. Such
po&s;itive intelligence, conveyed by a per|&s;on of &s;uch high rank and
character, was &s;ufficient with many to put the matter beyond all que&s;tion,
and excited the wonder and attention even of the mo&s;t indif|ferent. The whole
nation were held in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; a regular con&s;piracy was formed again&s;t
the King's authority; and a corre&s;pondence &s;ettled between the
malecon|tents in Flanders and tho&s;e in England.</P>
<P>THE King was well informed of all the&s;e particulars; but
agreeable to his cha|racter, which was both cautious and re&s;olute, he
proceeded very deliberately, but &s;teadily, in counter-working the projects of
his enemies. His fir&s;t object was to a&s;certain the death of the real duke
of York, and to confirm the opinion, which had always prevailed with regard to
that event. Four per&s;ons had been em|ployed by Richard in the murder of his
nephews; Sir James Tirrel, to whom he had committed the government of the Tower
for that purpo&s;e, and who had &s;een the dead princes; Miles Forre&s;t and
John Dighton, who perpetrated the action; and the prie&s;t who buried the
bodies. Tirrel and Dighton alone were alive, and they agreed in the &s;ame
&s;tory; but as the prie&s;t was dead, and as the bodies had 
<PB N="37" REF="43"> been removed by Richard's orders from the place where they
were fir&s;t interred, and could not now be found, it was not in Henry's power
to put the fact, &s;o much as he wi&s;hed, beyond all doubt and
controver&s;y.</P>
<P>HE met at fir&s;t with more difficulty, but was in the end more
&s;ucce&s;sful, in detecting who this wonderful per&s;on was that thus boldly
advanced preten&s;ions to his crown. He di&s;per&s;ed his &s;pies all over
Flanders and England; he engaged many to pretend that they had embraced
Perkin's party; he directed them to in|&s;inuate them&s;elves into the
con&s;idence of his friends; in proportion as they con|veyed intelligence of
any con&s;pirator, he bribed his retainers, his dome&s;tic &s;ervants, nay
&s;ometimes his confe&s;&s;or, and by the&s;e means traced up &s;ome other
confederate; Clifford him&s;elf he engaged by hopes of reward and pardon, to
betray the &s;ecrets committed to him; the more tru&s;t he gave any of his
&s;pies, the higher re&s;entment did he feign again&s;t them; &s;ome of them he
even cau&s;ed to be excommunicated and publicly anathematized, in order the
better to procure them the confidence of his enemies: And in the i&s;&s;ue, the
whole plan of the con&s;piracy was laid clearly before him; and the whole
pedigree, adventures, life and conver&s;ation of the pretended duke of York.
This latter &s;tory was im|mediately publi&s;hed for the &s;atisfaction of the
nation: The con&s;pirators he re&s;erved for a flower and more &s;ecure
vengeance.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1494" UNIT="year"> MEANWHILE, he remon&s;trated
with the archduke Philip, on account of the countenance and protection, which
was afforded in his dominions to &s;o infamous an impo&s;ture; contrary to
treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the &s;overeigns, and to the mutual amity,
which had &s;o long been maintained by the &s;ubjects of both &s;tates.
Margaret had intere&s;t enough to get his applications rejected; under pretence
that Philip had no authority over the deme&s;nes of the dutche&s;s dowager. And
the King, in re&s;entment of this injury, cut off all commerce with the Low
Countries, bani&s;hed the Flemings from England, and recalled his own
&s;ubjects from the&s;e provinces. Philip retaliated by like edicts; but Henry
knew, that &s;o mutinous a people as the Flemings would not long bear, in
compliance with the humours of their prince, to be deprived of &s;o beneficial
a branch of commerce as that which they carried on with England.</P>
<P>HE had it in his power to inflict more effectual puni&s;hment on
his dome&s;tic enemies; and when his projects were &s;ufficiently matured, he
failed not to make them feel the effects of his re&s;entment. Almo&s;t in the
&s;ame in&s;tant, he arre&s;ted Fitzwater, Mountfort, and Thwaites, together
with William Daubeney, Robert Ratcliff, Thomas Cre&s;&s;enor, and Thomas
A&s;twood. All the&s;e were arraigned, convicted, and condemned for high
trea&s;on, in adhering and promi&s;ing aid to Per|kin. <PB N="38" REF="44">
Mountfort, Ratcliff, and Daubeney were immediately executed: Fitzwater was
&s;ent over to Calais, and retained in cu&s;tody; but having practi&s;ed on his
keeper for an e&s;cape, he &s;oon after underwent the &s;ame fate. The re&s;t
were par|doned, together with William Wor&s;eley, dean of St. Paul's, and
&s;ome others, who had been accu&s;ed and examined, but not brought to public
trial<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 592.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>GREATER and more &s;olemn preparations were e&s;teemed
requi&s;ite for the trial of Stanley, lord chamberlain, who&s;e authority in
the nation, who&s;e dome&s;|tic connexions with the King, as well as his former
great &s;ervices, &s;eemed to &s;ecure him again&s;t any accu&s;ation or
puni&s;hment. Clifford was directed to come over privately to England, and to
throw him&s;elf at the King's feet, while placed at the council table; craving
pardon for his pa&s;t offences, and offering to attone for them by any
&s;ervices, which &s;hould be required of him. Henry told him, that the be&s;t
proof he could give of penitence, and the only &s;ervice he could now render
him, was the full confe&s;&s;ion of his guilt, and the di&s;covery of all his
ac|complices, however di&s;tingui&s;hed by rank or character. Encouraged by
this exhortation, Clifford accu&s;ed Stanley then pre&s;ent, as his chief
abettor; and offered to lay before the council the whole proofs of his guilt.
Stanley him&s;elf could not di&s;cover more &s;urprize than was affected by
Henry on this occa&s;ion. He received the intelligence as ab&s;olutely fal&s;e
and incredible; that a man, to whom he was, in a great mea&s;ure, beholden for
his crown, and even for his life; a man, to whom, by every honour and favour,
he had endeavoured to expre&s;s his gratitude; who&s;e brother, the earl of
Derby, was the King's father-in-law; to whom he had even committed the tru&s;t
of his per&s;on, by creating him lord cham|berlain: That this man, enjoying his
full confidence and affection, not actuated by any motive of di&s;content or
apprehen&s;ion, &s;hould engage in a con&s;piracy again&s;t him. Clifford was
therefore exhorted to weigh well the con&s;equences of this accu&s;ation; but
as he per&s;i&s;ted in the &s;ame po&s;itive a&s;&s;everations, Stanley was
committed to cu&s;tody, and &s;oon after examined before the council<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 611. Polyd. Virg. p. 593.</NOTE>. He denied
not the guilt imputed to him by Clifford; he did not even endeavour much to
extenuate it; whether he thought that a frank and open confe&s;&s;ion would
&s;erve for an atonement, or tru&s;ted to his pre&s;ent connexions, and his
former &s;ervices, for pardon and &s;ecurity. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and ex|ecution of Stanley.</NOTE> But
princes are often apt to regard great &s;ervices as a ground of jealou&s;y,
e&s;pecially if accompanied with a craving and re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition, in
the per&s;on who has performed them. The general di&s;content al&s;o, and
mutinous humour of the people, &s;eemed to require &s;ome great example of
&s;everity. And as Stanley was one of the mo&s;t opulent &s;ubjects in the
kingdom, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <PB N="39" REF="45">
<MILESTONE N="1495" UNIT="year"> of above three thou&s;and pounds a year in
land, and forty thou&s;and merks in plate and money, be&s;ides other property
of great value, the pro&s;pect of &s;o rich a forfeiture was deemed no &s;mall
motive in Henry for proceeding to extremity again&s;t him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th of Fe|bruary.</NOTE> After &s;ix weeks
delay, which was interpo&s;ed in order to &s;hew that the King was re&s;trained
by doubts and &s;cruples; he was brought to his trial, condemned, and
pre&s;ently after beheaded. Hi&s;torians are not well agreed with regard to the
crime which was proved again&s;t him. The general report is, that he &s;hould
have &s;aid in confidence to Clifford, that, if he was &s;ure the young man,
who appeared in Flanders, was really &s;on to King Edward, he never would bear
arms again&s;t him. This &s;entiment might di&s;gu&s;t Henry as implying a
preference of the hou&s;e of York to that of Lanca&s;ter, but could &s;carcely
be the ground, even in tho&s;e arbitrary times, of a &s;entence of high
trea&s;on again&s;t Stanley. It is more probable, therefore, what is
a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome hi&s;torians, that he had expre&s;sly engaged to
a&s;&s;i&s;t Perkin, and had actually &s;ent him &s;ome &s;upply of money.</P>
<P>THE fate of Stanley made great impre&s;&s;ion on the whole
kingdom, and &s;truck all Perkin's retainers with the deepe&s;t di&s;may. From
Clifford's de&s;ertion, they found that all their &s;ecrets were di&s;covered;
and as it appeared, that Stanley, even while he &s;eemed to live in the
greate&s;t confidence with the King, had been continually &s;urrounded by
&s;pies, who reported and regi&s;tered every action which he committed, nay,
every word which fell from him, a general di&s;tru&s;t took place, and all
mutual confidence was de&s;troyed, even among the mo&s;t intimate friends and
acquaintance. The jealous and &s;evere temper of the King, together with his
great reputation for &s;agacity and penetration, kept men in awe, and quelled
not only the movements of &s;edition, but the very murmurs of faction. Libels,
however, crept out again&s;t Henry's per&s;on and admini&s;tration; and being
greedily propagated, by every &s;ecret art, &s;howed that there &s;till
remained among the people a con&s;iderable root of di&s;content, which wanted
only a proper opportunity to di&s;cover it&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT Henry continued more intent on increa&s;ing the terrors of
his people, than on gaining their affections. Tru&s;ting to the great
&s;ucce&s;s which attended him in all his enterprizes, he gave every day, more
and more, a loo&s;e to his ra|pacious temper, and employed the arts of
perverted law and ju&s;tice, in order to exact fines and compo&s;itions from
his people. Sir William Capel, alderman of London, was condemned on &s;ome
penal &s;tatutes to pay the &s;um of 2743 pounds, and was obliged to compound
for &s;ixteen hundred and fifteen. This was the fir&s;t noted ca&s;e of that
nature; but it became a precedent, which prepared the <PB N="40" REF="46"> way
for many others. The management, indeed, of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive arts was the
great &s;ecret of the King's admini&s;tration. While he depre&s;&s;ed the
nobility, he exalted, and honoured and care&s;&s;ed the lawyers; and by that
means both be&s;towed authority on the laws, and was enabled, whenever he
plea&s;ed, to per|vert them to his own advantage. His government was
oppre&s;&s;ive; but it was &s;o much the le&s;s burthen&s;ome, that, by
extending his own authority, and curbing the nobles, he became in reality the
&s;ole oppre&s;&s;or in his kingdom.</P>
<P>AS Perkin found, that the King's authority gained ground daily
among the people, and that his own preten&s;ions were becoming ob&s;olete, he
re&s;olved to attempt &s;omething, which might revive the hopes and
expectations of his partizans. Hav|ing gathered together a band of outlaws,
pirates, robbers, and nece&s;&s;itous per&s;ons of all nations, to the number
of 600 men, he put to &s;ea with a re&s;olution of mak|ing a de&s;cent in
England; and of exciting the common people to arms, &s;ince all his
corre&s;pondence with the nobility was cut off by Henry's vigilance and
&s;e|verity. Information being brought him, that the King had made a progre&s;s
to the north, he ca&s;t anchor on the coa&s;t of Kent, and &s;ent &s;ome of his
retainers a&s;hore, who invited the country to join him. The gentlemen of Kent
gathered together &s;ome troops to oppo&s;e him; but they propo&s;ed to do more
e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice than by repelling the inva&s;ion: They carried the
&s;emblance of friend&s;hip to Perkin, and invited him to come him&s;elf
a&s;hore, in order to take the command over them. But the wary youth,
ob&s;erving that they had more order and regu|larity in their movements than
could be &s;uppo&s;ed in new levied forces, who had taken arms again&s;t
e&s;tabli&s;hed authority, refu&s;ed to commit him&s;elf into their hands; and
the Kenti&s;h troops de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s in their &s;tratagem, &s;et
upon &s;uch of his retainers, as were already landed; and be&s;ides &s;ome who
were &s;lain and &s;ome who e&s;caped, they took an hundred and fifty
pri&s;oners. The&s;e were tried and condemned; and all of them executed, by
order from the King, who was re&s;olved to u&s;e no mixture of lenity towards
men of &s;uch de&s;perate fortunes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p.
595.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> THIS year a Parliament
was &s;ummoned in England, and another in Ireland; and &s;ome remarkable laws
were pa&s;&s;ed in both countries. The Engli&s;h Parlia|ment enacted, that no
per&s;on who &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t in arms or otherwi&s;e the King for the time
being &s;hould ever afterwards, either by cour&s;e of law or act of
Parlia|ment, be attainted for &s;uch an in&s;tance of obedience. This &s;tatute
might be ex|po&s;ed to &s;ome blame, as favourable to u&s;urpers; were there
any preci&s;e rules, which always, even during the mo&s;t factious times, could
determine the true &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, and render every one inexcu&s;able, who
did not &s;ubmit to him. But as the titles of princes are then the great
&s;ubject of di&s;pute, and each party pleads <PB N="41" REF="47"> topics in
their own favour, it &s;eems but equitable to &s;ecure tho&s;e who act in
&s;up|port of e&s;tabli&s;hed tranquillity, an object at all times of undoubted
benefit and importance. Henry, con&s;cious of his di&s;puted title, promoted
this law in order to &s;ecure his partizans again&s;t all events; but as he had
him&s;elf ob&s;erved a dif|ferent practice with regard to Richard's adherents,
he had rea&s;on to apprehend, that, during the violence which u&s;ually
en&s;ues on public convul&s;ions, his example, rather than his law, would, in
ca&s;e of a new revolution, be followed by his enemies. And the attempt to bind
the legi&s;lature it&s;elf, by pre&s;cribing rules to future Parliaments, was
plainly contradictory to the fundamental principles of political
government.</P>
<P>THIS Parliament al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed an act, impowering the King to
levy by cour&s;e of law, all the &s;ums which any per&s;on had agreed to pay by
way of benevolence: A &s;tatute, by which that arbitrary method of taxation was
directly authorized and ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>THE King's authority appeared equally prevalent and
uncontrolable in Ireland. Sir Edward Poynings had been &s;ent over with &s;ome
troops into that country, with an intention of quelling the partizans of the
hou&s;e of York, and of reducing the natives to &s;ubjection. He was not
&s;upported with forces &s;ufficient for that important enterprize: The
Iri&s;h, by flying into their woods, and mora&s;&s;es, and mountains, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, eluded his efforts: But Poynings &s;ummoned a par|liament at Dublin,
where he was more &s;ucce&s;sful. He pa&s;&s;ed that memorable &s;tatute, which
&s;till bears his name, and which e&s;tabli&s;hes the authority of the
Engli&s;h government in Ireland. By this &s;tatute, the Parliament of England
were empowered to make laws for Ireland; and no bill can be introduced into the
Iri&s;h parliament, unle&s;s it previou&s;ly receive the &s;anction of the
council of England.</P>
<P>WHILE Henry's authority was thus e&s;tabli&s;hed throughout his
dominions, and general tranquillity prevailed, the whole continent was thrown
into combu&s;tion by the French inva&s;ion of Italy, and by the rapid
&s;ucce&s;s which attended Charles in that ra&s;h and ill-concerted enterprize.
The Italians, who had entirely lo&s;t the u&s;e of arms, and who, in the
mid&s;t of continual wars, had become every day more unwarlike, were
a&s;toni&s;hed to meet with an enemy, that made the field of battle, not a
pompous tournament, but a &s;cene of blood, and &s;ought at the hazard of their
own lives the death of their enemy. Their e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">eminate troops were di&s;&s;ipated every where on the approach of
the French army: Their be&s;t fortified cities opened their gates: Kingdoms and
&s;tates were in an in&s;tant over|turned: And thro' the whole length of Italy,
which the French penetrated with|out <PB N="42" REF="48"> re&s;i&s;tance, they
&s;eemed rather to be taking quarters in their own country, than making
conque&s;ts over an enemy. The maxims, which the Italians, during that age,
followed in negotiations, were as ill calculated to &s;upport their &s;tates,
as the habits to which they were addicted in war. A treacherous, deceitful, and
incon&s;tant &s;y&s;tem of politics prevailed; and even tho&s;e &s;mall remains
of fidelity and honour, which were pre&s;erved in the councils of the other
European princes, were ridiculed in Italy, as proofs of ignorance and
ru&s;ticity. Ludovico, duke of Milan, who invited the French to invade Naples,
had never de&s;ired nor ex|pected their &s;ucce&s;s; and was the fir&s;t
alarmed at the pro&s;perous i&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e projects, which he him&s;elf
had concerted. By his intrigues a league was formed among &s;everal potentates
to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of Charles's conque&s;ts and &s;ecure their own
independency. This league was compo&s;ed of Ludovico him&s;elf, the pope,
Maximilian King of the Romans, Ferdinand of Spain, and the republic of Venice.
Henry too entered into the confederacy; but was not put to any ex|pence or
trouble in con&s;equence of his engagements. The King of France, terrified by
&s;o powerful a combination, retired from Naples with the greate&s;t part of
his army, and returned to France. The forces, which he left in his new
conque&s;ts, partly by the revolt of the inhabitants, partly by the inva&s;ion
of the Spaniards, were &s;oon after &s;ubdued; and the whole kingdom of Naples
&s;uddenly returned to its allegiance under Ferdinand, &s;on to Alphon&s;o, who
had been &s;uddenly expelled by the irruption of the French. Ferdinand died
&s;oon after; and left his uncle, Frederic, in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the throne.</P>

<P>AFTER Perkin was repul&s;ed from the coa&s;t of Kent, he retired
into Flan|ders; but as he found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ub&s;i&s;t him&s;elf
and his followers, while he remained in tranquillity, he &s;oon after made an
attempt upon Ireland, which had always appeared forward to join every invader
of Henry's authority. But Poinings had now put the affairs of that i&s;land in
&s;o good a po&s;ture, that Perkin met with little &s;ucce&s;s; and being tired
of the &s;avage life, which he was obliged to lead, while &s;kulking among the
wild Iri&s;h, he bent his cour&s;e towards Scotland, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf
to James the fourth, who then governed that kingdom. He had been previou&s;ly
recommended to that prince by the King of France, who was di&s;gu&s;ted that
Henry had entered into the league again&s;t him; and this recommendation was
even &s;econded by Maximilian, who, tho' one of the confederates, &s;tood on
ill terms with the King, on account of his prohibition of commerce with the Low
Countries.

The in&s;inuating addre&s;s and plau&s;ible behaviour of the youth him&s;elf
&s;eem even to have gained him credit and authority. James, whom years had not
yet taught di&s;tru&s;t and caution, was &s;educed to believe the &s;tory of
Perkin's birth and adventures; and he carried his confidence &s;o far as to
give him in marriage the lady Catherine Gordon, daughter of the Farl of
Huntley, and a near kin&s;woman of his own; a young woman too, eminent for
virtue as well as beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="50"> <MILESTONE N="1496" UNIT="year"> THERE
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted at that time a great jealou&s;y between the courts of England
and Scotland; and James was probably the more forward on that account to adopt
any fiction, which, he thought, might reduce his enemy to di&s;tre&s;s or
difficulty. He &s;uddenly re&s;olved to make an inroad into England, attended
with &s;ome of the borderers; and he carried Perkin along with him, in hopes,
that the appearance of the pretended prince might rai&s;e an in&s;urrection in
the northern counties. Perkin him&s;elf di&s;per&s;t a manife&s;to, where he
&s;et forth his own &s;tory, and craved the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all his
&s;ubjects in expelling the u&s;urper, who&s;e tyranny and
mal-admini&s;tration, who&s;e depre&s;&s;ion of the nobility by the elevation
of mean per&s;ons, who&s;e oppre&s;&s;ion of the people by multiplied
impo&s;itions and vexations, had ju&s;tly, he &s;aid, rendered him odious to
all men. But Perkin's preten&s;ions, attended by repeated di&s;appointments,
were now become &s;tale in the eyes even of the populace; and the ho&s;tile
di&s;po&s;itions, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the king|doms, rendered a
prince, &s;upported by the Scotch, but an unwelcome pre&s;ent to the Engli&s;h
nation. The ravages al&s;o, committed by the borderers, accu&s;tomed to licence
and di&s;order, &s;truck a terror into all men; and made the people pre|pare
rather for repelling the invaders than for joining them. Perkin, that he might
&s;upport his preten&s;ions to royal birth, feigned great compa&s;&s;ion for
the mi&s;ery of his plundered &s;ubjects; and publickly remon&s;trated with his
ally again&s;t the de|predations exerci&s;ed by the Scotch army<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 598.</NOTE>: But James told him, that he
doubted his concern was employed only in behalf of his enemy, and that he was
anxious to pre&s;erve what never would belong to him. That prince now began to
per|ceive, that his attempt would be fruitle&s;s; and hearing of an army, which
was on its march to attack him, he thought proper to retreat into his own
country.</P>
<P>THE King di&s;covered little anxiety to procure either
reparation or vengeance for this in&s;ult committed on him by the Scotch
nation: His chief concern was to draw advantage from it, by the pretence which
it would afford him to levy impo&s;itions on his own &s;ubjects. He &s;ummoned
a Parliament, to whom he made bitter complaints again&s;t the irruption of the
Scotch, the ab&s;urd impo&s;ture which was countenanced by that nation, the
cruel deva&s;tation which they had &s;pread over the northern counties, and the
complicated affront which had thus been offered both to the King and kingdom of
England. The Parliament made the expected return to this di&s;cour&s;e of the
King, by granting him a &s;ub&s;idy to the amount of 120,000 pounds, together
with two fifteenths. After making this grant, they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="51"> <MILESTONE N="1497" UNIT="year"> THE vote
of parliament for impo&s;ing the tax was ea&s;ily procured by the au|thority of

The people, who were acquainted with the immen&s;e trea&s;ures ama&s;&s;ed by
the King, could ill brook the new impo&s;itions rai&s;ed on every &s;light
occa&s;ion; and it is probable, that the flaw, which was univer&s;ally known to
lie in his title, made his reign the more &s;ubject to in&s;urrections and
rebellions. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrection in the We&s;t.</NOTE> When the
&s;ub|&s;idy began to be levied in Cornwal, the inhabitants, numerous and poor,
robu&s;t and courageous, murmured again&s;t a tax, occa&s;ioned by a &s;udden
inroad of the Scotch, from which they e&s;teemed them&s;elves entirely
&s;ecure, and which had commonly been repelled by the force of the northern
counties. Their ill humour was farther incited by one Michael Jo&s;eph, a
farrier of Bodmin, a notable, talking fellow, who, by thru&s;ting him&s;elf
forward on every occa&s;ion, and being loude&s;t in every complaint again&s;t
the government, had acquired an authority among the&s;e rude people. Thomas
Flammoc too, a lawyer, who had become the ora|cle of the neighbourhood,
encouraged the &s;edition, by informing them, that the tax, tho' impo&s;ed by
Parliament, was entirely illegal; that the northern nobility, by their tenures,
were obliged to defend the nation again&s;t the Scotch; and that if the&s;e new
impo&s;itions were tamely &s;ubmitted to, the avarice of Henry and of his
courtiers would &s;oon render the burthen intolerable upon the nation. A
petition, he &s;aid, mu&s;t be delivered to the King, &s;econded by &s;uch
force as would give it authority; and in order to procure the concurrence of
the re&s;t of the kingdom, care mu&s;t be taken, by their orderly deportment,
to &s;hew that they had nothing in view but the public good, and the redre&s;s
of all tho&s;e grievances, under which the people had &s;o long laboured.</P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by the&s;e &s;peeches, the multitude flocked
together, and armed them&s;elves with axes, bills, bows, and &s;uch weapons as
country people are u&s;ually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. Flammoc and Jo&s;eph were
cho&s;en their leaders. They &s;oon conducted the Corni&s;h through the county
of Devon, and reached that of Somer&s;et. At Taunton the in&s;urgents killed in
their fury an officious and eager commi&s;&s;ioner for the &s;ub&s;idy, whom
they called the provo&s;t of Perin. When they reached Wells, they were joined
by lord Audley, a nobleman of an antient family, popular in his deportment, but
vain, ambitious, and re&s;tle&s;s in his temper. He had from the beginning
entertained a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the fir&s;t movers of the
in&s;urrection; and was now joyfully re|ceived by them as their leader. Proud
of the countenance given them by &s;o con|&s;iderable a nobleman, they pu&s;hed
on their march; breathing de&s;truction to the King's mini&s;ters and
favourites, particularly Morton, now a cardinal, and Sir Reginald Bray, who
were deemed his mo&s;t active in&s;truments in all his oppre&s;&s;ions.
Amid&s;t their rage again&s;t the admini&s;tration, they carefully followed the
di|rections <PB N="46" REF="52"> given them by their leaders; and as they met
with no re&s;i&s;tance, they committed, during their march, no violence or
di&s;order.</P>
<P>THE in&s;urgents had been told by Flammoc, that the inhabitants
of Kent, as they had ever, during all ages, remained un&s;ubdued, and had even
maintained their independancy during the Norman conque&s;t, would &s;urely
embrace their party, and declare them&s;elves for a cau&s;e, which was no other
than that of public good and general liberty. But the Kenti&s;h people had very
lately di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by repelling Perkin's inva&s;ion; and
having received from the King many gracious acknowledgments for this &s;ervice,
their affections were, by that means, much conciliated to his government. It
was ea&s;y therefore, for the earl of Kent, lord Abergavenny, and lord Cobham,
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great authority in tho&s;e parts, to retain the people in
obedience; and the Corni&s;h rebels, though they pitched their camp near
Eltham, at the very gates of London, and invited all the people to join them,
got reinforcement from no quarter. There wanted not di&s;content every where,
but no one would take part in &s;o ra&s;h and ill-concerted an enterprize; and
the &s;ituation in which the King's affairs then &s;tood, di&s;cou|raged even
the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t daring.</P>
<P>HENRY, in order to oppo&s;e the Scotch, had already levied an
army, which he put under the command of lord Daubeney, the chamberlain; and
&s;o &s;oon as he heard of the Corni&s;h in&s;urrection, he ordered it to march
&s;outhwards, and &s;up|pre&s;s the rebels. Not to leave the northern frontier
defencele&s;s, he di&s;patched thither the earl of Surry, who &s;ummoned out
the forces on the borders, and made head again&s;t the enemy. Henry found here
the concurrence of the three mo&s;t fatal incidents, which can befal a
monarchy; a foreign enemy, a dome&s;tic rebellion, and a pretender to his
throne; but he enjoyed great re&s;ources in his army and trea&s;ure, and
&s;till more, in the intrepidity and courage of his own temper. He gave not,
however, immediately full &s;cope to his military &s;pirit. On other
occa&s;ions, he had always ha&s;tened to a deci&s;ion, and it was an u&s;ual
&s;aying with him, <HI>that he de&s;ired but to &s;ee his rebels:</HI> But as
the Corni&s;h in&s;urgents behaved in an inoffen&s;ive manner, and committed no
&s;poil on the country, as they received no acce&s;&s;ion of force on their
march or in their encampment, and as &s;uch ha&s;ty and popular tumults might
be expected to dimini&s;h every moment by delay, he took po&s;t in London, and
carefully prepared the means of en&s;uring the victory.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Blackheath.</NOTE> AFTER all his
forces were collected, he divided them into three bodies, and marched out to
a&s;&s;ail the enemy. The fir&s;t body, commanded by the earl of Oxford, and
under him by the earls of E&s;&s;ex and Suffolk, were appointed to place
them&s;elves behind the hill on which the rebels were encamped: The &s;econd 
<PB N="47" REF="53"> and mo&s;t con&s;iderable Henry put under the command of
lord Daubeney, and or|dered him to attack the enemy in front, and bring on the
action. The third, he kept as a body of re&s;erve about his own per&s;on, and
took po&s;t in St. George's field; where he &s;ecured the city, and could
ea&s;ily, as occa&s;ion &s;erved, either re&s;tore the fight or fini&s;h the
victory. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of June.</NOTE> To put the enemy off their
guard, he had &s;pread a report that he was not to attack them till &s;ome days
after; and the better to confirm them in this opinion, he began not the action
till near the evening. Dau|beney beat a detachment of the rebels from
Deptford-bridge; and before the main body could be in order to receive him, he
had gained the a&s;cent of the hill, and placed him&s;elf in array before them.
They were very formidable for their numbers, being &s;ixteen thou&s;and
&s;trong, and were not defective in valour; but being tumultuary troops, ill
armed, and unprovided of cavalry or artillery, they were but an une|qual match
for the King's forces. Daubeney began the attack with courage, and even with a
contempt of the enemy, which had almo&s;t proved fatal to him. He ru&s;hed into
the mid&s;t of them, and was taken pri&s;oner; but &s;oon after was re|lieved
by his own troops. After &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, the rebels were broke, and put
to flight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 601.</NOTE>. Lord Audley,
Flammoc, and Jo&s;eph, their leaders, were taken, and all three executed. The
latter &s;eemed even to exult in his end, and boa&s;ted, with a prepo&s;terous
ambition, that he would make a figure in hi&s;tory. The rebels, being
&s;urrounded on every &s;ide by the King's troops, were almo&s;t all made
pri&s;oners; and immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without farther puni&s;hment.
Whe|ther, that Henry was &s;atisfied with the victims who had fallen in the
field, and who amounted to near two thou&s;and, or that he pitied the ignorance
and &s;implicity of the multitude, or favoured them on account of their
inoffen&s;ive behaviour, or was plea&s;ed that they had never, during their
in&s;urrection, di&s;puted his title, and had &s;hewn no attachment to the
hou&s;e of York, the mo&s;t capital crime of which in his eyes they could have
been guilty.</P>
<P>THE Scotti&s;h King was not idle during the&s;e commotions in
England. He levied a con&s;iderable army, and &s;at down before the ca&s;tle of
Norham in North|umberland; but found that place, by the precaution of Fox,
bi&s;hop of Durham, &s;o well provided both in men and ammunition, that he made
little or no progre&s;s in the &s;iege. Hearing that Surrey had collected
&s;ome forces and was advancing upon him, he retreated backwards into his own
country, and left the frontiers expo&s;ed to the inroads of the Engli&s;h
general, who be&s;ieged and took Aiton, a &s;mall ca&s;tle that lies a few
miles beyond Berwic. The&s;e un&s;ucce&s;sful or frivolous attempts on both
&s;ides progno&s;ticated a &s;peedy end to the war; and Henry,
not|with&s;tanding his &s;uperior force, was no le&s;s de&s;irous than James of
terminating the <PB N="48" REF="54"> differences between the nations. Not to
depart, however, from his dignity, by making the fir&s;t advances towards
peace, he employed in this friendly office Peter Hialas, a man of addre&s;s and
learning, who had come to him as amba&s;&s;ador from Ferdinand and I&s;abella,
and who was charged with a commi&s;&s;ion of nego|tiating the marriage of the
infanta Catherine, their daughter, with Arthur prince of Wales<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 603.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HIALAS took a journey northwards, and offered his mediation
between James and Henry, as mini&s;ter of a prince, who was in alliance with
both potentates. Commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;oon appointed to meet, and confer of
the terms of accom|modation. The fir&s;t demand of the Engli&s;h was, that
Perkin &s;hould be put into their hands; but James replied, that he him&s;elf
was no judge of Perkin's pre|ten&s;ions, but having received him as a
&s;upplicant, and promi&s;ed him protection, he was determined not to betray a
man, whatever he was, who had tru&s;ted to his good faith and his genero&s;ity.
The next demand of the Engli&s;h met with no bet|ter reception: They required
reparation for the ravages committed by the late inroads into England: The
Scotch commi&s;&s;ioners replied, that the &s;poils were like water &s;pilt
upon the ground, which never could be recovered, and that Henry's &s;ubjects
were better able to bear the lo&s;s than their ma&s;ter's to repair it. Henry's
commi&s;&s;ioners next propo&s;ed, that the two Kings &s;hould have an
inter|view at Newca&s;tle, in order to adju&s;t all differences; but James
&s;aid, that he meant to treat of a peace, not to go a begging for it. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Truce with Scotland.</NOTE> Le&s;t the
conferences &s;hould break off altogether without effect, a truce was concluded
for &s;ome months; and James perceiving, that while Perkin remained in
Scotland, he never would enjoy a &s;olid peace with Henry, privately de&s;ired
him to depart the Kingdom.</P>
<P>ACCESS was now barred Perkin into the low countries; his u&s;ual
retreat in all his di&s;appointments. The Flemi&s;h merchants, who felt
&s;everely the lo&s;s re&s;ult|ing from their want of commerce with England,
had made &s;uch intere&s;t in the arch-duke's council, that commi&s;&s;ioners
were &s;ent to London, in order to treat of an accommodation. The Flemi&s;h
court agreed that all Engli&s;h rebels &s;hould be excluded the low countries;
and in this prohibition the deme&s;nes of the dutche&s;s dowager were
expre&s;sly comprehended. When this principal article was agreed to, all the
other terms were ea&s;ily adju&s;ted. A treaty of com|merce was fini&s;hed,
which was favourable to the Flemings, and to which they gave long the
appellation of <HI>Intercur&s;us magnus,</HI> the great treaty. And when the
Engli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">h merchants returned to their
u&s;ual man&s;ion at Antwerp, they were pub|licly received, as in
proce&s;&s;ion, with great joy and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;tivity.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="55"> PERKIN was a Fleming by de&s;cent, tho'
born in England; and it might there|fore be doubted, whether he was
comprehended in the treaty between the two nations: But as he mu&s;t
di&s;mi&s;s all his Engli&s;h retainers if he took &s;helter in the low
countries, and as he was &s;ure of a cold reception, if not bad u&s;age, among
a people who were determined to keep on terms of friend&s;hip with the court of
England; he thought fit rather to hide him&s;elf, during &s;ome time, in the
wilds and fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of Ireland. Impatient however of a retreat, which
was both di&s;agreeable and dangerous, he held con&s;ultations with his
followers, Herne, Skelton, and A&s;tley, three broken trade&s;men; and by their
advice, re&s;olved to try the affec|tions of the Corni&s;h, who&s;e mutinous
di&s;po&s;ition, notwith&s;tanding the King's lenity, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted,
after the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of their rebellion. No &s;ooner did he appear at
Bodmin in Cornwal, than the populace, to the number of three thou|&s;and men,
flocked to his &s;tandard; and Perkin, elated with this appearance of
&s;ucce&s;s, took on him, for the fir&s;t time, the appellation of Richard the
fourth, King of England. Not to &s;uffer the expectations of his followers to
langui&s;h, he pre&s;ented him&s;elf before Exeter; and by many fair
promi&s;es, invited that city to join his cau&s;e. Finding that the inhabitants
&s;hut their gates again&s;t him, he laid &s;iege to the place; but being
unprovided of artillery, ammunition, and of every thing requi&s;ite for that
attempt, he made no progre&s;s in his undertaking. Me&s;|&s;engers were &s;ent
to the King, informing him of this in&s;urrection; and the citizens meanwhile
were determined to hold out to the la&s;t extremity, in expectation of
receiving &s;uccour from the known vigilance of that monarch.</P>
<P>WHEN Henry was informed, that Perkin was landed in England, he
expre&s;&s;ed great joy, and prepared him&s;elf with alacrity to attack him, in
hopes of being able, at la&s;t, to put a period to a preten&s;ion, which had
&s;o long given him vex|ation and inquietude. All the courtiers, &s;en&s;ible
that their activity on this occa|&s;ion would be the mo&s;t acceptable
&s;ervice which they could render the King, prepared them&s;elves for the
enterprize, and forwarded his preparations. The lords Daubeney, and Broke, with
Sir Rice ap Thomas, ha&s;tened forward with a &s;mall body of troops to the
relief of Exeter. The earl of Devon&s;hire, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
gentlemen in the country of that name, took arms of them|&s;elves, and marched
to join the King's generals. The duke of Buckingham put him&s;elf at the head
of a troop of young nobility and gentry, who &s;erved as vo|luntiers, and who
longed for an opportunity of di&s;playing their courage and their loyalty. The
King him&s;elf prepared to follow with a con&s;iderable army; and thus all
England &s;eemed united again&s;t a pretender, who had at fir&s;t engaged their
attention, and divided their affections.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="56"> PERKIN, informed of the&s;e great
preparations&punc; immediately broke up the &s;iege of Exeter, and retired to
Taunton. Tho' his followers now amounted to the number of near &s;even
thou&s;and men, and &s;eemed &s;till re&s;olute to defend his cau&s;e, he
him&s;elf de&s;paired of &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;ecretly withdrew to the
&s;anctuary of Beuley in the new fore&s;t. The Corni&s;h rebels &s;ubmitted
them&s;elves to the King's mercy, and found that it was not yet exhau&s;ted in
their behalf. Except a few per&s;ons of de&s;perate fortunes, who were
executed, and &s;ome others who were &s;everely fined, all the re&s;t were
di&s;mi&s;t with impunity. The Lady Catherine Gordon, wife to Perkin, fell into
the conqueror's hands, and was treated with a genero&s;ity, which does him
honour. He &s;oothed her mind with many tokens of regard, placed her in a
reputable &s;tation about the queen, and a&s;&s;igned her a pen&s;ion, which
&s;he enjoyed even under his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>HENRY next deliberated what cour&s;e to take with Perkin
him&s;elf. Some coun|&s;elled him to make the privileges of the church yield to
rea&s;ons of &s;tate, to take him by violence from the &s;anctuary, to inflict
on him the puni&s;hment due to his temerity, and thus at once to put an end to
an impo&s;ture which had long di&s;turbed the government, and which the
credulity of the people and the artifices of male-contents were &s;till capable
of reviving. But the King deemed not the matter of &s;uch importance as to
merit &s;o violent a remedy. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perkin taken pri&s;oner.</NOTE> He employed
&s;ome per&s;ons to deal with Perkin, and per&s;wade him, under promi&s;e of
pardon, to deliver him&s;elf into the King's hands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 606.</NOTE>. The King conducted him in a
&s;pecies of mock triumph to London. As Perkin pa&s;&s;ed along the road, and
through the &s;treets of that city, men of all ranks flocked about him, and the
populace treated with the highe&s;t deri&s;ion his fallen fortunes. They
&s;eemed de&s;irous of revenging them|&s;elves by their in&s;ults for the
&s;hame which their former belief of his impo&s;tures had thrown upon them.
<MILESTONE N="1498" UNIT="year"> Tho' the eyes of the nation were generally
opened with re|gard to Perkin's real parentage and &s;tation, Henry thought
proper to require of him a confe&s;&s;ion of his life and adventures; and he
ordered the account of the whole to be publi&s;hed &s;oon after for the
&s;atisfaction of the public. But as his re|gard to decency made him
&s;uppre&s;s entirely the &s;hare which the dutche&s;s of Bur|gundy had had in
contriving and conducting the impo&s;ture, the people, who knew that &s;he had
been the chief in&s;trument in the whole affair, were inclined, on account of
the &s;ilence on that head, to pay le&s;s credit to the authenticity of the
narrative.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1499" UNIT="year"> BUT Perkin, tho' his life was
granted him, was &s;till retained in cu&s;tody; and keepers were appointed to
guard him. Impatient of confinement, he broke loo&s;e from his keepers, and
flying to the &s;anctuary of Shyne, put him&s;elf into the hands 
<PB N="51" REF="57"> of the prior of that mona&s;tery. The prior had obtained
great credit by his cha|racter of &s;anctity; and he prevailed with the King
again to grant a pardon to Per|kin. But in order to reduce him to &s;till
greater contempt, he was &s;et in the &s;tocks We&s;tmin&s;ter and at
Cheap&s;ide, and obliged in both places to read aloud to the people the
confe&s;&s;ion which had been formerly publi&s;hed in his name. He was thrown
into the Tower, where his habits of re&s;tle&s;s intrigue and enterprize
&s;till followed him. He in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the intimacy of four
&s;ervants of Sir John Digby, lieutenant of the Tower; and by their means,
opened a corre&s;pon|dence with the earl of Warwic, who was confined to the
&s;ame pri&s;on. That un|fortunate prince, who had from his earlie&s;t infancy
been &s;hut up from the com|merce of men, and who was ignorant even of the
mo&s;t common affairs of life, had fallen into a &s;implicity which made him
&s;u&s;ceptible of any impre&s;&s;ions. The continued dread al&s;o of the more
violent effects of Henry's tyranny, joined to the natural love of liberty,
engaged him to embrace a project for his e&s;cape, by the murder of the
lieutenant; and Perkin offered to conduct the whole enterprize. The
con&s;piracy e&s;caped not the King's vigilance: It was even very generally
be|lieved, that the &s;cheme was laid by him&s;elf, in order to draw Perkin and
Warwic into the &s;nare: But the &s;ub&s;equent execution of two of Digby's
&s;ervants for the contrivance &s;eems to clear the King of that imputation,
which was indeed founded more on the general idea entertained of his character,
than on any po&s;itive evidence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perkin exe|cuted.</NOTE> PERKIN, by this new
attempt, after &s;o many enormities, had rendered him&s;elf totally unworthy of
mercy; and he was accordingly arraigned, condemned, and &s;oon after hanged at
Tyburn, per&s;i&s;ting &s;till in the confe&s;&s;ion of his impo&s;ture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stow, Baker, Speed, Biondi, Holing&s;hed, Bacon&punc; Some
late writers have been &s;o whim&s;ical as to doubt, whether Perkin was an
impo&s;tor, and even to a&s;&s;ert him to be the real Richard Plantagenet, duke
of York. But to refute this fancy, we need but reflect on the few following
particulars. 1. Had not the queen mother, and the other heads of the York
party, been fully a&s;&s;ured of the death of both the young princes, would
they have agreed to call over the earl of Richmond, the head of the
Lanca&s;trian party, and marry him to the prince&s;s Flizabeth? 2. The &s;tory
told con&s;tantly by Perkin of his e&s;cape is ut|terly incredible, that
tho&s;e who were &s;ent to murder his brother took pity on him, and granted him
his liberty. 3. What became of him during the cour&s;e of &s;even years, from
his &s;uppo&s;ed death till his appearance in Ireland in 1491? Why was not the
queen mother, the dutche&s;s of Burgundy, and the other friends of the family
applied to, during that time, for his &s;upport and education? 4. Tho' the
dutche&s;s of Burgundy at la&s;t acknowledged him for her nephew, &s;he had
lo&s;t all pretence to authority by her former acknowledgment and &s;upport of
Lambert Simnel, an avowed impo&s;tor. It is remarkable, that Mr. Carte, in
order to pre&s;erve the weight of the dutche&s;s's te&s;timony, in favour of
Perkin, &s;up|pre&s;&s;es entirely this material fact. A remarkable effect of
party prejudices, and the author's de&s;ire of blackening Henry the &s;eventh,
who&s;e hereditary title to the crown was defective. 5. Perkin him&s;elf
con|fe&s;&s;ed his impo&s;ture more than once, and read his confe&s;&s;ion
before the whole people. It is pretended that this confe&s;&s;ion was drawn
from him by torture; but no antient hi&s;torian gives any ground for this
&s;urmi&s;e. 6. He renewed his confe&s;&s;ion at the foot of the gibbet on
which he was executed. 7. After Henry the eighth's acce&s;&s;ion, the titles of
the hou&s;e of York and Lanca&s;ter were fully confounded, and there was no
longer any nece&s;&s;ity for defending Henry the &s;eventh and his title; yet
all the hi&s;torians of that time, when the events were recent, &s;ome of
the&s;e hi&s;torians too, &s;uch as Sir Thomas More, of the highe&s;t
authority, agree in treating Perkin as an impo&s;tor.</NOTE>. 
<PB N="52" REF="58"> It happened about that very time, that one Wilford, a
cordwainer's &s;on&punc; encou|raged by the &s;urprizing credit which had been
given to other impo&s;tures, had undertaken to per&s;onate the earl of Warwic;
and a prie&s;t had even ventured from the pulpit to recommend his cau&s;e to
the people, who &s;eemed &s;till to retain a propen&s;ity to adopt it. This
incident &s;erved Henry as an apology for his &s;everity towards that
unfortunate prince. He was brought to trial, and accu&s;ed, not of contriving
his e&s;cape, (for as he was committed for no crime, the de&s;ire of liberty
mu&s;t have been regarded as natural and innocent) but of forming de&s;igns to
di&s;turb the government, and rai&s;e an in&s;urrection among the people. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of Warwic exe|cuted.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">21&s;t of No|vember.</NOTE> Warwic
confe&s;&s;ed the indictment, was condemned, and the &s;entence was executed

<P>THIS violent tyranny, the great &s;tain of Henry's reign, by
which he de&s;troyed the la&s;t remaining male of the line of Plantagenet,
begot great di&s;content among the people, who &s;aw an unhappy prince, that
had long been deprived of all the privileges of his high birth, even cut off
from the common benefits of nature, now at la&s;t deprived of life it&s;elf,
merely for re&s;i&s;ting that oppre&s;&s;ion under which he laboured. In vain
did Henry endeavour to alleviate the odium of this guilt, by &s;haring it with
his ally, Ferdinand of Arragon, who, he &s;aid, had &s;crupled to give his
daughter Catherine in marriage to Arthur, while any prince of the hou&s;e of
York remained alive. Men, on the contrary, felt higher indignation at &s;eeing
a young prince &s;acrificed, not to law and ju&s;tice, but to the jealous
politics of two &s;ubtle and crafty tyrants.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the&s;e di&s;contents fe&s;tered in the minds of men,
they were &s;o checked by Henry's watchful policy and &s;teady &s;everity, that
they appeared not to weaken his government; and foreign princes, deeming his
throne now entirely &s;ecure, payed him rather the greater court&s;hip and
attention. The arch-duke Philip, in particular, de&s;ired an interview with the
King; and this monarch, who had pa&s;&s;ed over to Calais, agreed to meet him
at St. Peter's church near that city. The arch-duke, on his approaching the
King, made ha&s;te to alight, and offered to hold Henry's &s;tirrup; a mark of
conde&s;cen&s;ion, which that prince would not admit of. He called the King
<HI>father, patron, protector;</HI> and by his whole be|haviour expre&s;&s;ed a
&s;trong de&s;ire of conciliating the friend&s;hip of England. The 
<PB N="53" REF="59"> duke of Orleans had &s;ucceeded to the kingdom of France
under the appellation of Lewis the twelfth; and having carried his arms into
Italy, and &s;ubdued the dutchy of Milan, his progre&s;s begot jealou&s;y in
Maximilian, Philip's father, as well as in Ferdinand, his father-in-law. By the
council, therefore, of the&s;e monarchs, the young prince endeavoured by every
art to acquire the amity of Henry, whom they regarded as the chief counterpoize
to the greatne&s;s of France. No particu|lar plan however of alliance &s;eems
to have been concerted between the&s;e two prin|ces in their interview: All
pa&s;&s;ed in general profe&s;&s;ions of affection and regard; at lea&s;t, in
remote projects of a clo&s;er union, by the future intermarriages of their
children, who were then in a &s;tate of infancy.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1500" UNIT="year"> THE pope too, Alexander the
&s;ixth, neglected not the friend&s;hip of a monarch, who&s;e reputation was
&s;pread all over Europe. He &s;ent a nuntio to England, who exhorted the King
to take part in the great alliance projected for the recovery of the Holy Land,
and to lead in per&s;on his forces again&s;t the Turk. The gene|ral frenzy for
croi&s;adoes was now entirely exhau&s;ted in Europe; but it was &s;till thought
a nece&s;&s;ary piece of decency to pretend zeal for tho&s;e pious enterprizes.
Henry regreted the di&s;tance of his &s;ituation, which rendered it
inconvenient for him to expo&s;e his per&s;on in defence of the chri&s;tian
cau&s;e. He promi&s;ed, how|ever, his utmo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance by aids and
contributions; and rather than the pope &s;hould go alone to the holy wars,
unaccompanied by any monarch, he even pro|mi&s;ed to overlook all other
con&s;iderations, and to attend him in per&s;on. He only required as a
nece&s;&s;ary condition, that all differences &s;hould be previou&s;ly
compo&s;ed among chri&s;tian princes, and that &s;ome &s;ea-port towns in Italy
&s;hould be put into his hands for his retreat and &s;ecurity. It was ea&s;y to
conclude from this an&s;wer, that Henry had determined with him&s;elf not to
intermeddle in any wars again&s;t the Turk: But as a great name, without any
real a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is &s;ometimes of &s;ervice, the knights of Rhodes, who
were at that time e&s;teemed the bulwark of Chri&s;tendom, cho&s;e the King
protector of their order.</P>
<P>BUT the prince, who&s;e alliance Henry valued the mo&s;t, was
that of Ferdinand of Arragon, who&s;e vigorous and &s;teddy policy, always
attended with &s;ucce&s;s, had rendered him, in many re&s;pects, the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable monarch in Europe. There was al&s;o a remarkable &s;imilarity of
character between the&s;e two princes: Both were full of craft, intrigue, and
de&s;ign; and tho' a re&s;emblance of this na|ture be a &s;lender foundation of
confidence and friend&s;hip, where the intere&s;ts of the parties in the
lea&s;t interfere; yet &s;uch was the &s;ituation of Henry and Ferdi|nand, that
no jealou&s;y ever on any occa&s;ion aro&s;e between them.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of prince Arthur with Catherine of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th of No|vember.</NOTE> The King had now the
&s;atisfaction of compleating a marriage, which had been projected and

and <PB N="54" REF="60"> <MILESTONE N="1502" UNIT="year"> the infanta
Catherine, fourth daughter of Ferdinand and I&s;abella; he near &s;ixteen years

<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of April.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His death.</NOTE> The young prince, a few

Henry, de&s;irous to continue his alliance with Spain, and al&s;o unwilling to
re&s;tore Catherine's dowry, which was two hundred thou&s;and ducats, obliged
his &s;econd &s;on, Henry, whom he created prince of Wales, to be contracted to
the prince&s;s. The prince made all the oppo&s;ition which a youth of twelve
years of age was capable of; but as the King per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution,
the e&s;pou&s;als were at la&s;t, by means of the pope's di&s;pen&s;ation,
concluded between the parties: An event, which was afterwards attended with the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the prince&s;s Margaret with the

was al&s;o, in the next age, productive of great events: The marriage of
Margaret, the King's elde&s;t daughter, with James King of Scotland. This
alliance had been negotiated during three years, tho' interrupted by &s;everal
broils; and Henry hoped, from the completion of it, to remove all &s;ource of
di&s;cord with that neighbouring king|dom, by who&s;e animo&s;ity England had
been &s;o often infe&s;ted. When this marriage was deliberated on in the
Engli&s;h council, &s;ome objected, that England might, by means of that
alliance, fall under the dominion of Scotland. 
<Q REND="inline">"No;" replied Henry, "Scotland, in that event,
would only become an acce&s;&s;ion to England."</Q>
<MILESTONE N="1503" UNIT="year"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of Fe|bruary.</NOTE> Amid&s;t the&s;e
pro&s;perous events, the King met with a dome&s;tic calamity, which made not
&s;uch impre&s;&s;ion on him as it merited. His queen died in child-bed; and
the infant lived not long after. This prince&s;s was de&s;ervedly a great
favourite of the nation; and the general affection for her encrea&s;ed, on
account of the har&s;h treatment, which, it was thought, &s;he met with from
her con&s;ort.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation of the King's affairs, both at home and abroad,
was now, in every re&s;pect, very de&s;irable. All the efforts of the European
princes, both in war and negotiation, were turned to the &s;ide of Italy; and
the various events, which there aro&s;e, made Henry's alliance be courted by
every party, and yet intere&s;ted him &s;o little as never to touch him with
concern or anxiety. His clo&s;e connexions with Spain and Scotland en&s;ured
his tranquillity; and his continued &s;ucce&s;&s;es over dome&s;tic enemies,
owing to the prudence and vigour of his conduct, had reduced the people to
entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oppre&s;&s;ions of the people.</NOTE> Henry
therefore, uncontrouled by apprehen&s;ion or oppo&s;ition of any kind, gave
full &s;cope to his natural propen&s;ity; and avarice, which had ever been his
predominant pa&s;&s;ion, being encr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ed by age, and encouraged by ab&s;olute authority, broke all
re&s;traints of &s;hame or ju&s;tice. He had found two mini&s;ters, Emp&s;on
and Dudley, perfectly qualified to &s;econd his rapacious and tyrannical
inclinations, and prey <PB N="55" REF="61"> upon his defencele&s;s people.
The&s;e In&s;truments of oppre&s;&s;ion were both lawyers, the fir&s;t of mean
birth, of brutal manners, of an unrelenting temper; the &s;e|cond better born,
better educated, and better bred, but equally unju&s;t, &s;evere, and
inflexible. By their knowledge in the law, the&s;e men were qualified to
per|vert the forms of ju&s;tice to the oppre&s;&s;ion of the innocent; and the
formidable authority of the King &s;upported them in all their iniquities.</P>
<P>IT was their u&s;ual practice to ob&s;erve &s;o far the
appearance of law as to give indictments to tho&s;e whom they intended to
oppre&s;s: Upon which the per&s;ons were committed to pri&s;on, but never
brought to trial; and were at la&s;t obliged to recover their liberty, by
paying heavy fines and ran&s;oms, which were called mitigations and
compo&s;itions. By degrees, the very appearance of law was ne|glected: They
&s;ent forth their precepts to attach men, and &s;ummon them before
them&s;elves and &s;ome others, at their private hou&s;es, in a court of
commi&s;&s;ion; where, in a &s;ummary manner, without trial or jury, arbitrary
decrees were i&s;&s;ued, both in pleas of the crown and controver&s;ies between
private parties. Juries them&s;elves, when &s;ummoned, proved but &s;mall
&s;ecurity to the &s;ubject; being brow-beat by the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ors; nay,
fined, impri&s;oned, and puni&s;hed, if they gave &s;entence again&s;t the
inclination of the mini&s;ters. The whole &s;y&s;tem of the feudal law, which
then prevailed, was turned into a &s;cheme of oppre&s;&s;ion. Even the King's
wards, after they came to full age, were not &s;uffered to enter in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their lands without paying exorbitant fines. Men were
al&s;o hara&s;&s;ed with informations of intru&s;ion upon &s;carce colourable
titles. When an outlawry in a per&s;onal action was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t any
man, he was not allowed to purcha&s;e his charter of pardon, except on the
payment of a great &s;um; and if he refu&s;ed the compo&s;ition required of
him, the &s;trict law, which, in &s;uch ca&s;es, allows for|feiture of goods,
was rigorou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on. Nay, without any colour of law, the half of
men's lands and rents were &s;eized during two years, as a penalty in ca&s;e of
outlawry. But the chief in&s;trument of oppre&s;&s;ion, employed by the&s;e
mini&s;ters, were the penal Statutes, which, without con&s;ideration of rank,
quality, or &s;ervices, were &s;trictly put in execution again&s;t all men:
Spies, informers, and inqui&s;itors were rewarded and encouraged in every
corner of the kingdom: And no difference was made whether the &s;tatute was
beneficial or hurtful, recent or ob&s;olete, po&s;&s;ible or impo&s;&s;ible to
be executed. The &s;ole end of the King and his mini&s;ters was to ama&s;s
money, and bring every one under the la&s;h of their authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, 629, 30. Holling&s;hed, p. 504. Polyd. Virg. p. 613,

<P><PB N="56" REF="62"> BY the prevalence of &s;uch an arbitrary

were con&s;iderable lo&s;ers by the ancient privilege, which &s;ecured them
from all taxations and impo&s;itions, except &s;uch as were levied by their own
con&s;ent. Had the King been empowered to lay on general taxes at his
plea&s;ure, he would naturally have ab&s;tained from the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive
expedients, which de&s;troyed all &s;ecurity in private property, and begot an
univer&s;al diffi|dence thro' the nation. In vain did the people look for
protection from the Parliament, which was pretty frequently &s;ummoned during
this reign. <MILESTONE N="1504" UNIT="year"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th January.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> That a&s;&s;embly was

was the chief in&s;trument of his oppre&s;&s;ions. And tho' the King was known
to be immen&s;ely opulent, and had no pretence of wars or expen&s;ive
enterprizes of any kind, they granted him the &s;ub&s;idy, which he demanded.
<MILESTONE N="1505" UNIT="year"> But &s;o in&s;atiable was his avarice, that
the next year he levied a new benevolence, and renewed that arbitrary and

to a rigid frugality in his expence, he &s;o filled his coffers, that he is
&s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in ready money the &s;um of 1,800,000 pounds:
An in|credible trea&s;ure, if we con&s;ider the &s;carcity of money in tho&s;e
days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Silver was during this reign at 37 &s;hillings and
&s;ix pence a pound, which makes Henry's trea&s;ure above 2,750&punc;000 pounds

appear very great; and may lead us to conceive the oppre&s;&s;ions of his
government.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT while Henry was enriching him&s;elf with the &s;poils of his
oppre&s;&s;ed people, there happened an event abroad, which engaged his
attention, and was even the object of his anxiety and concern. I&s;abella,
queen of Ca&s;tile, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed about this
time; and it was fore&s;een, that by this incident the fortunes of Ferdi|dand,
her hu&s;band, would be much affected. The King was not only attentive to the
&s;ate of his ally, and watchful le&s;t the general &s;y&s;tem of Europe
&s;hould be affected by &s;o important an event: He al&s;o con&s;idered the
&s;imilarity of his own &s;ituation with that of Ferdinand, and regarded the
i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e tran&s;actions as a precedent for him&s;elf. Joan, the
daughter of Ferdinand by I&s;abella, was married to the archduke Philip, and
being, in right of her mother, heire&s;s of Ca&s;tile, &s;eemed entitled to
di&s;pute with Ferdinand the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration of that kingdom. Henry
knew, that, notwith&s;tanding his own preten&s;ions by the hou&s;e of
Lanca&s;ter, the greate&s;t part of the nation were convinced of the
&s;upe|riority of his wife's title; and he dreaded le&s;t the prince, who was
daily advanc|ing towards manhood, might be tempted by ambi ion to lay immediate
claim to <PB N="57" REF="63"> the throne. By his perpetual attention to
depre&s;s the partizans of the York family, he had more clo&s;ely united them
into one party, and encrea&s;ed their de&s;ire of &s;haking off that yoke,
under which they had &s;o long laboured, and of taking every advantage, which
his oppre&s;&s;ive government would give his enemies again&s;t him. And as he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no independent force like Ferdinand, and go|verned a kingdom
more turbulent and unruly, which he him&s;elf, by his narrow politics, had
confirmed in factious prejudices; he apprehended that his &s;ituation would
prove in the i&s;&s;ue &s;till more precarious.</P>
<P>NOTHING could turn out more contrary to the King's inclination
than the tran&s;actions in Spain. Ferdinand had become very unpopular in
Ca&s;tile, chiefly by rea&s;on of his former exactions and impo&s;itions; and
the &s;tates of the kingdom di&s;|covered an evident re&s;olution of preferring
the title of Philip and Joan. <MILESTONE N="1506" UNIT="year"> In order to
take advantage of the&s;e favourable di&s;po&s;itions, the archduke, now King
of Ca&s;tile, attended with his con&s;ort, embarked for Spain during the winter
&s;ea&s;on; and meeting with a violent tempe&s;t in the channel, was obliged to
take &s;helter in the harbour of Weymouth. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A rival of the King of Ca&s;|tile.</NOTE> Sir
John Trenchard, a gentleman of authority in the county of Dor&s;et, hearing of
a fleet upon the coa&s;t, had a&s;&s;embled &s;ome forces; and being joined by
Sir John Cary, who was al&s;o at the head of an armed body, he came to that
town. Finding, that Philip, in order to relieve his &s;ickne&s;s and fatigue,
was already come a&s;hore, he invited him to his hou&s;e; and immediately
di&s;patched an expre&s;s to inform the court of this important incident. The
King &s;ent in all ha&s;te the earl of Arundel to congratulate the archduke on
his arrival in England, and to inform him, that he intended to pay him a
vi&s;it in per&s;on, and give him a &s;uitable reception in his kingdom. Philip
knew, that he could not now depart without the King's con&s;ent; and therefore,
for the &s;ake of di&s;patch, he re&s;olved to anticipate his vi&s;it, and to
have an interview with him at Wind&s;or. Henry received him with all the
magnificence po&s;&s;ible, and with all the &s;eeming cordiality; but he
re&s;olved, notwith&s;tanding, to extract &s;ome advantage from this

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of the Earl of Suffolk.</NOTE>
EDMOND de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, nephew to Edward the fourth, and bro|ther
to the earl of Lincoln, &s;lain at the battle of Stoke, had &s;ome years before
killed for a man in a &s;udden fit of pa&s;&s;ion, and had been obliged to
apply to the King for a remi&s;&s;ion of his crime. The King had granted his
reque&s;t; but being little indulgent to all per&s;ons connected with the
hou&s;e of York, he obliged him to appear openly in court and plead his pardon.
Suffolk more re&s;enting the affront, than grateful for the favour, had fled
into Flanders, and taken &s;helter with his aunt, the dutche&s;s of Burgundy:
But being promi&s;ed forgivene&s;s by the King, he returned into England, and
obtained a new pardon. Actuated, however, by the <PB N="58" REF="64"> natural
inquietude of his temper, and unea&s;y from debts which he had contracted by
his expences at prince Arthur's marriage, he again made an elopement into
Flanders. The King, well acquainted with the general di&s;content which
pre|vailed again&s;t his admini&s;tration, neglected not this incident, which
might be|come of importance; and he employed his u&s;ual artifices to elude the
efforts of his enemies. He directed Sir Robert Cur&s;on, governor of the
ca&s;tle of Hammes, to fly from his charge, and to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into
the confidence of Suffolk, by making him a tender of his &s;ervices. Upon
information &s;ecretly conveyed by Cur&s;on, the King &s;eized William
Courtney, earl of Devon&s;hire, his brother in law, married to the lady
Catherine, daughter of Edward the fourth; Wil|liam de la Pole, brother to the
earl of Suffolk; Sir James Tirrel, and Sir James Windham, with &s;ome per&s;ons
of inferior quality; and he committed them all to cu&s;tody. The lord
Abergavenny and Sir Thomas Green were al&s;o appre|hended; but were &s;oon
after freed from their confinement. William de la Pole was retained in pri&s;on
during a long time: And the earl of Devon&s;hire recovered not his freedom
during the King's life. But Henry's chief &s;everity fell upon Sir James
Windham, and Sir James Tirrel, who were both brought to their trial, condemned,
and executed: The fate of the latter gave univer&s;al &s;ati&s;|faction, on
account of his participation in the murther of the young princes, &s;ons to
Edward the fourth. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;coveries and executions,
Cur&s;on was &s;till able to maintain his credit with the earl of Suffolk; and
Henry, in order to remove all &s;u&s;picions, had ordered him to be
excommunicated, to|gether with Suffolk him&s;elf, for his pretended rebellion.
But after that traitor had performed all the &s;ervices expected from him, he
&s;uddenly de&s;erted the earl, and came over to England, where the King
received him with unu&s;ual marks of favour and confidence. Suffolk,
a&s;toni&s;hed at this in&s;tance of perfidy, finding even that the dutche&s;s
of Burgundy, tired with &s;o many fruitle&s;s attempts, had become indifferent
to his cau&s;e, fled &s;ecretly into France, thence into Germany, and returned
at la&s;t into the Low Countries; where he was protected, tho' not
countenanced, by the archduke Philip, then in clo&s;e alliance with the
king.</P>
<P>HENRY neglected not the pre&s;ent opportunity of compliaining to
Philip of the reception, which Suffolk had met with in his dominions. 
<Q REND="inline">"I really thought," replied the King of
Ca&s;tile, "that your greatne&s;s and felicity had &s;et you far above

Ca&s;tile found him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of complying; but he fir&s;t
exacted Henry's promi&s;e that he would &s;pare Suffolk's life. That nobleman
was invited over to England by Philip; as if the King would grant him a pardon,
by the interce&s;&s;ion of his friend and ally. Upon his appearance, he was
committed to the Tower; and the King of Ca&s;tile, having fully &s;atisfied
Henry, as well by this conce&s;&s;ion, as by &s;igning a treaty of commerce

<P>THE King &s;urvived the&s;e tran&s;actions two years; but little

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sickne&s;s of the King.</NOTE> But the decline
of his health put an end to all &s;uch thoughts; and he began to ca&s;t his eye
towards that future exi&s;tence, which the iniquities and &s;everities of his
reign rendered a very di&s;mal pro&s;pect to him. To allay the terrors, under
which he laboured, he endeavoured, by di&s;tributing of alms and founding of
religious hou&s;es, to make attonement for his crimes, and to purcha&s;e, with
the &s;acrifice of part of his ill-gotten trea&s;ures, a recon|cilement to his
offended Maker. Remor&s;e even &s;eized him by intervals for the abu&s;es of
his authority by Emp&s;on and Dudley; but not &s;ufficient to make him &s;top
the repacious hand of tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ors. Sir William Capel was again fined
two thou&s;and pounds under &s;ome frivolous pretences, and was committed to
the Tower for daring to murmur again&s;t that iniquity. Harris, an alderman of
London, was indicted, and died of vexation before his trial came to an
i&s;&s;ue. Sir Lawrence Ailmer, who had been mayor, and his two &s;heriffs,
were condemned in heavy fines, and &s;ent to pri&s;on till they made payment.
The King gave coun|tenance to all the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions; till death, by its

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And character</NOTE> THE reign of Henry the
&s;eventh was, in the main, fortunate for his people at home, and honourable
abroad. He put an end to the civil wars with which the nation had been long
harra&s;&s;ed, he maintained peace and order in the &s;tate, he depre&s;&s;ed
the former exorbitant power of the nobility, and, together with the
friend&s;hip of &s;ome foreign princes, he acquired the con&s;ideration and
regard of all. He loved peace without fearing war; tho' agitated with continual
&s;u&s;picions of his &s;ervants and mini&s;ters, he di&s;covered no timidity
either in the conduct of his affairs, or in the day of battle; and tho' often
&s;evere in his puni&s;hments, he was commonly le&s;s actuated by revenge than
by the maxims of policy. The &s;ervices, which he rendered the people, were
derived from his views of private intere&s;t, rather than the motives of public
&s;pirit; and where he deviated from &s;elfi&s;h regards, it was unknown to
him&s;elf, and ever from the malignant pre|judices of faction or the mean
projects of avarice; not from the &s;allies of pa&s;|&s;ion, or allurements of
plea&s;ure; &s;till le&s;s, from the benign motives of friend&s;hip and
genero&s;ity. His capacity was excellent, but &s;omewhat contracted, by the
narrowne&s;s of his heart; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in&s;inuation and addre&s;s,
but never em|ployed the&s;e talents, except where &s;ome great point of
intere&s;t was to be gained; and while he neglected to conciliate the
affections of his people, he often felt the danger of re&s;ting his authority
on their fear and reverence alone. He was always extremely attentive to his
affairs, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not the faculty of &s;eeing far into futurity;
and was more expert at providing a remedy for his mi&s;takes than judi|cious in
avoiding them. Avarice was on the whole his ruling pa&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As a proof of Henry's attention to the &s;malle&s;t profits,
Bacon tells us, that he had &s;een a book of Accompts kept by Emp&s;on, and
&s;ub&s;cribed in almo&s;t every leaf by the King's own hand. Among other
articles was the following. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Item,</HI> Received of &s;uch a one five
marks for a pardon, which, if it do not pa&s;s, the money to be repayed, or the
party otherwi&s;e &s;atisfied."</Q> Oppo&s;ite to this memo|randum, the King
had wrote with his own hand, 
<Q REND="inline">"otherwi&s;e &s;atisfied."</Q> Bacon, p.
630.</NOTE>; and he remains an in&s;tance, almo&s;t &s;ingular, of a man,
placed in a high &s;tation, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of talents for great affairs,
in whom that pa&s;&s;ion predominated above ambition. Even among private
per&s;ons, avarice is commonly nothing but a &s;pecies of ambition, and is
chiefly incited by the pro&s;pect of that regard, di&s;|tinction and
con&s;ideration which are derived from riches.</P>
<P>THE power of the Kings of England had always been &s;omewhat
irregular or di&s;cretionary; but was &s;carce ever &s;o ab&s;olute during any
reign as during that of <PB N="61" REF="67"> Henry. Be&s;ides the per&s;onal
character of the man, full of vigour, indu&s;try, and &s;everity, deliberate in
all projects, &s;teady in every purpo&s;e, and attended with caution, as well
as good fortune, in each enterprize; became to the throne after long and bloody
civil wars, which had de&s;troyed all the great nobility, who alone could
re&s;i&s;t the encroachments of his authority: The nation was tired with
di&s;cord and inte&s;tine convul&s;ions, and willing to &s;ubmit to
u&s;urpations, and even injuries, rather than plunge them&s;elves anew into
like mi&s;eries: The fruitle&s;s efforts made again&s;t him &s;erved always, as
is u&s;ual, to confirm his authority: As he ruled by a faction, and the
le&s;&s;er faction, all tho&s;e on whom he conferred offices, &s;en&s;ible that
they owed every thing to his protection, were content to &s;upport his power,
tho' at the expence of ju&s;tice and national privileges: The&s;e &s;eem the
chief cau&s;es which at this time be&s;towed on the crown &s;o con&s;iderable
an addition of prerogative, and rendered the pre&s;ent reign a kind of epoch in
the Engli&s;h con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THIS prince, tho' he exalted his own prerogative above law, is
celebrated by his hi&s;torian for many good laws, which he cau&s;ed to be
enacted for the govern|ment of his &s;ubjects. Several con&s;iderable
regulations, indeed, are found among the &s;tatutes of this reign, both with
regard to the police of the kingdom, and its commerce: But the former are
commonly contrived with much better judge|ment than the latter. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His laws.</NOTE> The more &s;imple ideas of
order and equity are &s;ufficient to guide a legi&s;lator in every thing that
regards the internal admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice: But the principles of
commerce are much more complicated, and require long experience and deep
reflection to be well under&s;tood in any &s;tate. The real con&s;equence of a
law or practice is there often contrary to fir&s;t appearances. No wonder, that
during the reign of Henry the &s;eventh, the&s;e matters were often
mi&s;under&s;tood; and it may &s;afely be affirmed, that even in the age of
lord Bacon, very imperfect and erroneous ideas were formed on that
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>EARLY in Henry's reign, the authority of the Star Chamber, which
was be|fore founded on common law and very ancient practice, was in &s;ome
ca&s;es con|firmed by act of Parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl. 3.
H. 7. n. 17.</NOTE>: Lord Bacon extols the u&s;e of this court; but men began,
during the age of that hi&s;torian, to feel that &s;o arbitrary a
juri&s;|diction was totally incompatible with liberty; and in proportion as the
&s;pirit of independance ro&s;e &s;till higher in the nation, the aver&s;ion
again&s;t it increa&s;ed, till it was entirely aboli&s;hed by act of Parliament
in the reign of Charles the fir&s;t, a little before the commencement of the
civil wars.</P>
<P>LAWS were pa&s;&s;ed in this reign, ordering the King's &s;uit
for murder to be car|ried on within a year and day<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">3. H. 7. cap. 1.</NOTE>. Formerly, it did not u&s;ually commence
till <PB N="62" REF="68"> after that term; and as the friends of the per&s;on
murdered, in the interval, often compounded matters with the criminal, that
crime was apt to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed. Suits were given to the poor <HI>in forma
pauperis,</HI> as it is called: That is, without paying dues for the writs, or
any fees to the council<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">11 H 7. cap. 12.</NOTE>:
A good law at all times, e&s;pecially in that age, when the people laboured
under the oppre&s;&s;ion of the great; but a law very difficult to be reduced
to execution. A law was made again&s;t carrying off any woman by force<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 2.</NOTE>. The benefit of clergy was
abridged<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">4 H 7. cap. 13.</NOTE>, and the criminal,
on the fir&s;t offence, was ordered to be burned in the hand with a letter
marking his crime; after which, he was puni&s;hed capitally for every new
offence. This law was much too indulgent, yet was in tho&s;e days regarded as a
violation of the rights of the church. Sheriffs were no longer allowed to fine
any per&s;on, without previou&s;ly &s;ummoning him before their court<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 15.</NOTE>. It is &s;trange, that
&s;uch a practice &s;hould ever have prevailed. Attaint of juries was granted
in ca&s;es which exceeded forty pounds value<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7.

con&s;pired again&s;t the life of the &s;teward, trea&s;urer, or comptroller of
the King's hou&s;e, this de&s;ign, tho' not followed by any execution, was made
liable to the puni&s;hment of felony<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">3

&s;tatute was procured by the jealou&s;y of archbi&s;hop Morton, who found
him&s;elf expo&s;ed to the enmity of great numbers.</P>
<P>THERE &s;carce pa&s;&s;ed any &s;e&s;&s;ion during this reign
without &s;ome &s;tatute again&s;t engaging retainers, and giving them badges
or liveries<NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 1. &amp; 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. 11 H. 7. cap. 3. 19 H 7. cap.

&s;ome great lord, and were kept in readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in all
wars, in&s;urrections, riots, violences, and even in bearing evidence for him
in courts of ju&s;tice<NOTE N="&sect;&sect;" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 12. 11
H. 7. cap. 25.</NOTE>. This di&s;order, which had ari&s;en during turbulent
times, when the law could give little protection to the &s;ubject, was then
deeply rooted in England; and it required all the vigilance and rigour of Henry
to extirpate it. There is a &s;tory of his &s;everity again&s;t that abu&s;e;
which &s;eems to merit prai&s;e, tho' it is commonly cited as an in&s;tance of
his avarice and rapacity. The earl of Oxford, his favourite general, to whom he
always gave great and de&s;erved tru&s;t, having &s;plendidly entertained him
at his ca&s;tle of Heningham, was de&s;irous of making a &s;how of his
magnificence at the departure of his royal gue&s;t; and ordered all his
retainers, with their liveries and badges, to be drawn up in two lines, that
their appearance might be more ga lant and &s;plendid. 
<Q REND="inline">"My lord," &s;aid the King, "I have heard much
of your ho&s;pitality; but the truth far exceeds the report. The&s;e hand&s;ome
gentlemen <PB N="63" REF="69"> and yeomen, whom I &s;ee on both &s;ides of me,
are &s;urely your menial &s;ervants."</Q> The earl &s;miled, and confe&s;&s;ed
that his fortune was too narrow for &s;uch magnifi|cence. 
<Q REND="inline">"They are mo&s;t of them," &s;ubjoined he, "my
retainers, who are come to do me &s;ervice at &s;uch a time, when they knew I
was honoured with your maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence."</Q> The King &s;tarted a
little, and &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"By my faith, my lord, I thank you for my good
cheer, but I mu&s;t not allow my laws to be broken in my &s;ight. My attorney
mu&s;t &s;peak with you."</Q> Oxford is &s;aid to have payed no le&s;s than
fifteen thou&s;and marks, as a compo&s;ition for his offence.</P>
<P>THE encrea&s;e of the arts, more effectually than all the
&s;everities of laws, put an end to this pernicious practice. The nobility,
in&s;tead of vying with each other, in the number and boldne&s;s of their
retainers, acquired a more civilized &s;pecies of emulation, and endeavoured to
excell in the &s;plendour and elegance of their equi|page, hou&s;es, and
tables. The common people, no longer maintained in a vi|cious idlene&s;s by
their &s;uperiors, were obliged to learn &s;ome calling or indu&s;try, and
became u&s;eful both to them&s;elves and others. And it mu&s;t be acknowledged,
in &s;pite of tho&s;e who declaim &s;o violently again&s;t the refinement of
the art, or what they are plea&s;ed to call luxury, that, as much as an
indu&s;trious trade&s;man is both a better man and a better citizen that one of
tho&s;e idle retainers, who fo merly de|pended on the great families; as much
is the life of a modern nobleman more lau|dable than that of an antient
baron.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t important law in its con&s;equences, which was
enacted during the reign of Henry, was that by which the nobility and gentry
acquired a power of breaking the antient entails, and of alienating their
e&s;tates<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 24.</NOTE>. By means of
this law, joined to the beginning luxury and refinements of the age, the great
fortunes of the barons were gradually di&s;&s;ipated, and the property of the
commons en|crea&s;ed in England. It is probable, that Henry fore&s;aw and
intended this con&s;e|quence; becau&s;e the con&s;tant &s;cheme of his policy
con&s;i&s;ted in depre&s;&s;ing the great, and exalting churchmen, lawyers, and
men of new families, who were more dependant on him.</P>
<P>THIS King's love of money naturally led him to encourage
commerce, which encrea&s;ed his cu&s;toms; but, if we may judge by mo&s;t of
the laws enacted during his reign, trade and indu&s;try were rather hurt than
promoted by the care and attention which were given to them. Severe laws were
made again&s;t taking in|tere&s;t for money, which was then denominated
u&s;ury<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 5.</NOTE>. Even the profits
of ex|change were prohibited, as &s;avouring of u&s;ury<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 6.</NOTE>, which the &s;uper&s;tition of that age
zealou&s;ly pro&s;cribed. All eva&s;ive contracts, by which profits could be
made from the loan of money, were al&s;o carefully guarded again&s;t<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">7. H. 7. cap. 8.</NOTE>. It is needle&s;s to
ob&s;erve how unrea&s;onable and iniquitous the&s;e laws, how impo&s;&s;ible to
be exe|cuted, and how hurtful to trade, if they could take place. We may
ob&s;erve, <PB N="64" REF="70"> however, to the prai&s;e of this King, that
&s;ometimes, in order to promote com|merce, he lent to merchants &s;ums of
money, without intere&s;t; when he knew, that their &s;tock was not
&s;ufficient for tho&s;e enterprizes, which they propo&s;ed to undertake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LAWS were made again&s;t the exportation of money, plate, or
bullion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 23.</NOTE>: A precaution,
which &s;erves no other purpo&s;e than to make more be exported. But &s;o far
was the anxiety on this head carried, that merchant aliens, who im|ported
commodities into the kingdom, were obliged to inve&s;t, in Engli&s;h
com|modities, all the money acquired by their &s;ales, in order to prevent
their convey|ing away the money in a clande&s;tine manner<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HORSES were forbid to be exported; as if that exportation did
not encourage the breed, and render them more plentiful<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 13.</NOTE>. To promote archery, no bows were to be
&s;old at a higher price that &s;ix &s;hillings and four pence<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 12.</NOTE>, reducing money to the
denomination of our time. The only effect of this regulation mu&s;t be either
that the people would be &s;upplied with bad bows or none at all. Prices were
al&s;o affixed to woollen cloath<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap.
8.</NOTE>, to caps and hats<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap.
9.</NOTE>: And labourers wages were regulated by law<NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 22.</NOTE>. It is evident, that the&s;e
circum&s;tances ought always to be left free, and mu&s;t be tru&s;ted to the
common cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s and com|merce. To &s;ome it may appear
&s;urprizing, that the price of a yard of &s;carlet cloth &s;hould be limited
to &s;ix and twenty &s;hillings, that of a yard of coloured cloth to eighteen;
higher prices than the&s;e commodities bear at pre&s;ent: And that the wages of
a trade&s;man, &s;uch as a ma&s;on, bricklayer, tyler, &amp;c. &s;hould be
regulated at near ten pence a day; which is not much inferior to the pre&s;ent
wages given in &s;ome places of England. There is a vulgar error in imagining,
that the price of labour and commodities has in general ri&s;en extremely
&s;ince the di&s;covery of the We&s;t-Indies. The greater indu&s;try of the
pre&s;ent times has encrea&s;ed the number of trade&s;men and labourers, &s;o
as to keep wages nearer a par than could be ex|pected from the great encrea&s;e
of gold and &s;ilver. And the additional art em|ployed in the finer
manufactures, has even made &s;ome of the&s;e commodities fall below their
former value. Not to mention, that merchants and dealers, being contented with
le&s;s profit than formerly, afford the goods cheaper to their cu&s;tom|ers. It
appears by a &s;tatute of this reign<NOTE N="&sect;&sect;" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7.
cap. 9.</NOTE>. that goods bought for &s;ixteen pence would &s;ometimes be
&s;old by the merchants for three &s;hillings. The commodities, who&s;e price
has chiefly ri&s;en, are butcher-meat, fowl, and fi&s;h, (e&s;pecially the
latter) which cannot be much augmented in quantity by the encrea&s;e of art and
indu&s;try. The profe&s;&s;ion which then abounded mo&s;t, and was embraced by
per&s;ons of the lowe&s;t rank, was the church: By a clau&s;e of a &s;tatute,
all clerks or &s;tudents of the univer&s;ity were forbid to beg, without a
permi&s;&s;ion from the vice-chancellor<NOTE N="&Verbar;&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="71"> ONE great cau&s;e of the low &s;tate of
indu&s;try during this period, was the ridiculous re&s;traints put upon it; and
the parliament, or rather the King, (for he was the prime mover in every thing)
enlarged a little &s;ome of the&s;e limitations; but not to the degree that was
requi&s;ite. A ridiculous law had been enacted during the reign of Henry the
fourth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">7 H. 7. cap. 17.</NOTE>, that no man could bind
his &s;on or daughter to an apprentice&s;hip, unle&s;s he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of twenty &s;hillings a year in land; and Henry the &s;eventh, becau&s;e the
decay of manufactures was complained of in Norwich from the want of hands,
exempted that city from the penalties of this law<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 11.</NOTE>. Afterwards, the whole county of Norfolk
obtained a like exemption with regard to &s;ome branches of the woollen
manufacture<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">12 H. 7. cap 1.</NOTE>. The&s;e
ab&s;urd limita|tions proceeded from a de&s;ire of promoting hu&s;bandry, which
however is never more effectually encouraged than by the encrea&s;e of
manufactures. For a like rea&s;on, the law enacted again&s;t inclo&s;ures, and
for the keeping up farm hou&s;es<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap.
19.</NOTE>, &s;carce de&s;erves the high prai&s;es be&s;towed on it by lord
Bacon. If hu&s;bandmen under&s;tand agriculture, and have a ready vent for
their commodities, we need never dread a diminution of the people, employed in
the country. All me|thods of &s;upporting populou&s;ne&s;s, except by the
intere&s;t of the proprietors, are violent and ineffectual. During a century
and a half after this period, there was a continual renewal of laws and edicts
again&s;t depopulation; whence we may infer, that none of them were ever
executed. The natural cour&s;e of improvement at la&s;t provided a remedy.</P>
<P>ONE great check to indu&s;try in England was the erecting
corporations; an abu&s;e which is not yet entirely corrected. A law was
enacted, that corporations &s;hould not pa&s;s any by-laws without the
con&s;ent of three of the chief officers of &s;tate<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">19 H. 7. cap. 7.</NOTE>. They were prohibited to impo&s;e tolls at
their gates<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">19 H. 7. cap. 8.</NOTE>. The cities of
Gloce&s;ter and Wor|ce&s;ter had even impo&s;ed tolls on the Severne, which
were aboli&s;hed<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">19 H. 7. cap.
18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is a law of this reign<NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">12 H. 7. cap. 6.</NOTE>, containing a preamble, from which it
ap|pears, that the company of merchant adventurers in London, had, by their own
proper authority, debarred all the other merchants of the kingdom, from trading
to the great marts in the low countries, unle&s;s each trader previou&s;ly
payed them the &s;um of near &s;eventy pounds. It is &s;urpri&s;ing that &s;uch
a by-law (if it de&s;erves that name) could ever be carried into execution, and
that the authority of Parliament &s;hould be requi&s;ite to abrogate it.</P>
<P>IT was during this reign, on the &s;econd of Augu&s;t 1492, a
little before &s;un &s;et, that Chri&s;topher Columbus, a Florentine, &s;et out
from Cadiz on his memorable voyage for the di&s;covery of the we&s;tern world;
and a few years after, Va&s;quez de <PB N="66" REF="72"> Gama, a Portugue&s;e,
pa&s;&s;ed the cape of Good Hope, and opened a new pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t
Indies. The&s;e great events were attended with the mo&s;t important
con&s;equences to all the nations of Europe, even to &s;uch as were not
immediately concerned in tho&s;e naval enterprizes. The enlargement of commerce
and naviga|tion encr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ed
indu&s;try and the arts every where: The nobles di&s;&s;ipated their fortunes
in expen&s;ive plea&s;ures: Men of an inferior rank both acquired a &s;hare in
the landed property, and created to them&s;elves a con&s;iderable property of a
new kind, in &s;tock, commodities, art, credit, and corre&s;pondence. In &s;ome
nations the privileges of the commons encrea&s;ed, by this encrea&s;e of
property: In mo&s;t nations, the Kings, finding arms to be dropt by the barons,
who could no longer endure their former rude manner of life, e&s;tabli&s;hed
&s;tanding armies, and &s;ubdued the liberties of the kingdom: But in all
places, the condition of the people, from the depre&s;&s;ion of the petty
tyrants, by whom they had formerly been oppre&s;&s;ed, rather than governed,
received great improvement, and they acquired, if not entire liberty, at
lea&s;t the mo&s;t con&s;iderable advantages of it. And as the gene|ral
cour&s;e of events thus tended to depre&s;s the nobles and exalt the people,
Henry the &s;eventh, who al&s;o embraced that &s;y&s;tem of policy, has
acquired more prai&s;e, than his in&s;titutions, &s;trictly &s;peaking, &s;eem
of them&s;elves to de&s;erve, on account of any profound wi&s;dom attending
them.</P>
<P>IT was by accident only, that the King had not a con&s;iderable
hand in tho&s;e great naval di&s;coveries, by which the pre&s;ent age was &s;o
much di&s;tingui&s;hed. Columbus, after meeting many repul&s;es from the courts
of Portugal and Spain, &s;ent his brother Bartholomew into England, in order to
explain his projects to Henry, and crave his protection for the execution of
them. Henry invited him to England; but his brother, in returning to Spain,
being taken by pyrates, was detained in his voyage; and Columbus, mean-while,
having obtained the coun|tenance of I&s;abella, was equipped with a &s;mall
fleet, and happily executed his enterprize. Henry was not di&s;couraged with
this di&s;appointment: He fitted out Seba&s;tian Cabot, a Venetian, dwelling in
Bri&s;tol; and &s;ent him we&s;twards in 1498 in &s;earch of new countries.
Cabot di&s;covered the main land of America towards the &s;ixtieth degree of
northern latitude: He &s;ailed &s;outhwards along the coa&s;t, and di&s;covered
Newfoundland, and other countries: But returned to England without making any
conque&s;t or &s;ettlement. Elliot and other merchants in Bri&s;|tol made a
like attempt in 1502<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. XIII. p. 37.</NOTE>.
The King expended fourteen thou&s;and pounds in building one &s;hip called the

was properly &s;peak|ing the fir&s;t &s;hip in the Engli&s;h navy. Before this

and the di&s;covery of both the Indies, was the mo&s;t memorable incident that
happened during this or any other period, it was not the only great event by
which the age was di&s;tingui&s;hed. In 1453 Con&s;tantinople was taken by the
Turks; and the Greeks, among whom &s;ome remains of learning were &s;till

became fa&s;hion|able, and the e&s;teem for literature gradually propagated
it&s;elf through every nation of Europe. The art of printing, invented about
that time, facilitated extremely the progre&s;s of all the&s;e improvements:

were &s;oon after made in reli|gion, &s;uch as not only affected tho&s;e

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE death of Henry the &s;eventh had been attended with as open
and vi|&s;ible a joy as decency would permit; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Popularity of the new King.</NOTE> and the
acce&s;&s;ion and coronation of his &s;on, Henry the eighth, &s;pread
univer&s;ally a declared and unfeigned &s;atisfaction. In&s;tead of a monarch,
jealous, &s;evere, and avaritious, who, in proportion as he advanced in years,
was &s;inking &s;till deeper in tho&s;e unpopular vices; a young prince of
eighteen had &s;ucceeded to the throne, who, even in the eyes of men of
&s;en&s;e, gave very promi&s;ing hopes of his future conduct, much 
<PB N="70" REF="75"> more in tho&s;e of the people, always enchanted with
novelty, youth, and royal dignity. The beauty and vigour of his per&s;on,
accompanied with dexterity in every manly exerci&s;e, was farther adorned with
a blooming and ruddy counte|nance, with a lively air, with the appearance of
&s;pirit and activity in all his de|meanour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">T. Mori,
Lucubr. p. 182.</NOTE>. His father, in order to remove him from the knowledge
of public bu&s;ine&s;s, had hitherto occupied him entirely in the &s;tudy of
literature; and the proficiency, which he made, gave no bad progno&s;tic of his
parts and capacity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>.
Even the vices of vehemence, ardour, and impatience, to which he was &s;ubject,
and which afterwards degenerated into tyranny, were interpreted only as faults,
incident to unguarded youth, which would be corrected, when time had brought
him to greater moderation and maturity. And as the contending titles of York
and Lanca&s;ter were now at la&s;t fully united in his per&s;on, men ju&s;tly
expected from a prince, obnoxious to no party, that impartiality of
admini&s;tration, which had &s;o long been unknown in England.</P>
<P>THE favourable prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the public were
encouraged by the mea&s;ures, which Henry embraced in the commencement of his
reign. His grandmother, the counte&s;s of Richmond and Derby, was &s;till
alive; and as &s;he was a woman much celebrated for prudence and virtue, he
very wi&s;ely &s;hewed great deference to her opinion in the e&s;tabli&s;hment
of his new council. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His mini&s;ters.</NOTE> The members were,
Warham, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and chancellor; the earl of Shrew&s;bury,
&s;teward&punc; lord Herbert, chamberlain; Sir Thomas Lovel, ma&s;ter of the
wards and con&s;ta|ble of the Tower; Sir Edward Poynings, knight of the garter,
comptroller; Sir Henry Marney, afterwards lord Marney; Sir Thomas Darcy,
afterwards lord Darcy; Thomas Ruthal, doctor of laws; and Sir Henry Wyat<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Stow, p. 486. Holling|&s;hed, p. 799.</NOTE>. The&s;e men
had been long accu&s;tomed to affairs under the late King, and were the lea&s;t
un|popular of all the mini&s;ters employed by that monarch.</P>
<P>BUT the chief competitors for favour and authority under the new
King were the earl of Surrey, trea&s;urer, and Fox, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter,
&s;ecretary and privy &s;eal. This prelate, who had enjoyed great credit during
all the former reign, had acquired &s;uch habits of caution and frugality as he
could not ea&s;ily lay a&s;ide; and he &s;till oppo&s;ed, by his
remon&s;trances, tho&s;e &s;chemes of di&s;&s;ipation and ex|pence, which the
youth and pa&s;&s;ions of Henry rendered agreeable to him. But Surrey was a
more dextrous courtier; and tho' few had borne a greater &s;hare in the frugal
politics of the la&s;t King, he knew how to conform him&s;elf to the hu|mours
of his new ma&s;ter; and no one was &s;o forward in promoting that libera|lity,
plea&s;ure, and magnificence, which began to prevail under the young
mo|narch<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert.</NOTE>. By this policy he
ingratiated him&s;elf with Henry; he made profit, as <PB N="71" REF="76"> well
as the other courtiers, of the lavi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition of his ma&s;ter; and he
en|gaged him in &s;uch a cour&s;e of play and idlene&s;s as rendered him
negligent of af|fairs, and willing to entru&s;t the government of the &s;tate
entirely into the hands of his mini&s;ters. The immen&s;e trea&s;ures,
ama&s;&s;ed by the late King, were gra|dually di&s;&s;ipated in the giddy
expences of Henry. One party of plea&s;ure &s;uc|ceeded another: Tilts,
tournaments and carou&s;els were exhibited with all the magnificence of that
age: And as the pre&s;ent tranquillity of the public permitted the court to
indulge it&s;elf in every amu&s;ement, &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s was but little
attended to. Or if the King intermitted the cour&s;e of his fe&s;tivity, he
employed him&s;elf chiefly in an application to mu&s;ic and literature, which
were his favourite pur&s;uits, and which were well adapted to his genius. He
had made &s;uch pro|ficiency in the former art, as even to compo&s;e &s;ome
pieces of church mu&s;ic which were &s;ung in his chapel<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert.</NOTE>. He was initiated in the elegant learning of
the antients. And tho' he was &s;o unfortunate as to be &s;educed into a
&s;tudy of the barren controver&s;ies of the &s;chools, which were then
fa&s;hionable, and had cho&s;en Thomas Aquinas for his favourite author, he
&s;till di&s;covered a capacity fitted for more u&s;eful and entertaining
knowledge.</P>
<P>THE frank and carele&s;s humour of the King, as it led him to
di&s;&s;ipate the trea&s;ures, ama&s;&s;ed by his father, rendered him
negligent in protecting the in&s;tru|ments, whom that prince had employed in
his extortions. A proclamation be|ing i&s;&s;ued to encourage complaints, the
rage of the people was let loo&s;e on all the delators and informers, who had
&s;o long exerci&s;ed an unbounded tyranny over the nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Stow, p. 486. Holling&s;hed, p. 799. Pol. Virg. lib.
27.</NOTE>: They were thrown into pri&s;on, condemned to the pillory, and
mo&s;t of them lo&s;t their lives from the violence of the populace. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Puni&s;hment of Emp&s;on and Dudley.</NOTE>
Emp&s;on and Dudley, who were mo&s;t expo&s;ed to public hatred, were
immediately cited before the council, in order to an&s;wer for their conduct,
which had rendered them &s;o ob|noxious. Emp&s;on made a &s;hrewd apology for
him&s;elf, as well as for his a&s;&s;ociate. He told the council, that &s;o far
from his being ju&s;tly expo&s;ed to cen&s;ure for his pa&s;t conduct, his
enemies them&s;elves grounded their clamour on actions, which &s;eemed rather
to merit reward and approbation: That a &s;trict execution of law was the
crime, of which he and Dudley were accu&s;ed; tho' that law had been
e&s;tabli&s;hed by the voluntary con&s;ent of the people, and tho' they had
acted in obedience to the King, to whom the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice was
entru&s;ted by the con&s;titution: That it belonged not to them, who were
in|&s;truments in the hands of the &s;upreme power, to determine what laws were
re|cent or ob&s;olete, expedient or hurtful; &s;ince they were all alike valid,
&s;o long <PB N="72" REF="77"> as they remained unrepealed by the
legi&s;lature: That it was natural for a licentious populace to murmur
again&s;t the re&s;traints of authority; but all wi&s;e &s;tates had ever made
their glory to con&s;i&s;t in the ju&s;t di&s;tribution of reward and
puni&s;hment, and had annexed the former to the ob&s;ervance and enforcement of
the laws, the latter to their violation and infraction: And that a &s;udden
over|throw of all government might be expected; where the judges were committed
to the mercy of the criminals, the rulers to that of the &s;ubjects<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Holling&s;hed, p. 804.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this defence, Emp&s;on and Dudley were &s;ent to
the Tower; and &s;oon after brought to their trial. The &s;trict execution of
laws, however ob&s;olete, could never be imputed to them as a crime in a court
of ju|dicature; and it is likely, that even where they had exerci&s;ed
arbitrary power, the King, as they had acted by the &s;ecret commands of his
father, was not willing to have their conduct expo&s;ed to too &s;evere a
&s;crutiny. In order, there|fore, to gratify the people with the puni&s;hment
of the&s;e obnoxious mini&s;ters, crimes very improbable, or indeed
ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, were charged upon them, that they had entered into
a con&s;piracy again&s;t the King, and had intended, on the death of the late
King, to have &s;eized by force the admini&s;tration of the government. The
jury were &s;o far moved by popular prejudices, joined to court influence, as
to give &s;entence again&s;t them; which was afterwards con|firmed by a bill of
attainder in Parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Parliament met on the
21&s;t January, 1510. A law was there enacted, in order to prevent &s;ome
abu&s;es which had prevailed during the late reign. The forfeiture upon the
penal &s;tatutes was reduced to the term of three years. Co&s;ts and damages
were given again&s;t informers upon acquital of the accu&s;ed: More &s;evere
puni&s;hments were enacted again&s;t perjury: the fal&s;e inqui&s;itions
procured by Emp&s;on and Dudley were declared null and invalid. Traver&s;es
were allowed; and the time of tendering them enlarged. 1. H. 8. c. 8, 10, 11,

warrant from the King. Thus, in tho&s;e arbitrary times, ju&s;tice was equally
violated, whether the King &s;ought power and riches, or courted
popularity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King's mar|riage.</NOTE> THE King, while he
puni&s;hed the in&s;truments of pa&s;t tyranny, had yet &s;uch deference to
former engagements as to deliberate, immediately after his acce&s;&s;ion,
concerning the con&s;ummation of his marriage with the infanta Catherine, to
whom he was affianced during his father's lifetime. Her former marriage with
his brother, and the inequality of their years, were the chief objections,
which were urged again&s;t the e&s;pou&s;ing her: But on the other hand, the
advantages of her known virtue, mode&s;ty, and &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition
were in&s;i&s;ted on; the affection which &s;he bore the King; the large dowry
to which &s;he was entitled as prince&s;s of Wales; the intere&s;t of cementing
a clo&s;e alliance with Spain; the <PB N="73" REF="78"> nece&s;&s;ity of
finding &s;ome confederate to counterballance the power of France; the
expediency of fulfilling the engagements of the late King. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 3.</NOTE> When the&s;e con&s;iderations
were weighed, they determined the council, tho' contrary to the opinion of the
primate, to give Henry their advice for compleating the marriage; which was
done accordingly. The counte&s;s of Richmond, who had concurred in the &s;ame
&s;entiments, died &s;oon after the marriage of her grand&s;on.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1510" UNIT="year"> THE popularity of Henry's
government, his indi&s;puted title to the throne, his exten&s;ive authority,
his large trea&s;ures, the tranquillity of his &s;ubjects, were circum&s;tances
which rendered his dome&s;tic admini&s;tration ea&s;y and pro&s;perous: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign af|fairs.</NOTE> The &s;ituation of
foreign affairs was no le&s;s happy and de&s;irable. Italy continued &s;till,
as during the late reign, to be the center of all the wars and negotiations of
the European princes; and Henry's alliance was courted by both &s;ides; at the
&s;ame time, that he was not engaged by any immediate intere&s;t or
nece&s;&s;ity to take part with either. Lewis the twelfth of France, after the
conque&s;t of Milan, was the only great prince who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any
territory in Italy; and could he have remained in tranquillity, he was enabled
by his &s;ituation to pre&s;cribe laws to all the Italian princes and
republics, and to hold the ballance among them. But the de&s;ire of making a
conque&s;t of Naples, to which he had the &s;ame title or pre|ten&s;ion with
his predece&s;&s;or, &s;till engaged him in new enterprizes; and as he
fore&s;aw oppo&s;ition from Ferdinand, who was connected both by treaties and
affinity with Frederic of Naples, he endeavoured, by the offers of intere&s;t,
to which the ears of that monarch were ever open, to engage him in an
oppo&s;ite confederacy. He &s;ettled with him a plan for the partition of the
Kingdom of Naples and the expul&s;ion of Frederic: A plan, which the
politicians of that age regarded as the mo&s;t egregious imprudence in the
French monarch, and the ba&s;e&s;t treachery in the Spani&s;h. Frederic,
&s;upported only by &s;ubjects, who were either di&s;contented with his
government, or indifferent about his fortunes, was unable to re&s;i&s;t &s;o
powerful a confederacy, and was deprived of his dominions: But he had the
&s;atisfaction to &s;ee Naples immediately prove the &s;ource of con|tention
among his enemies. Ferdinand gave &s;ecret orders to his general, Gon&s;alvo,
whom the Spaniards honour with the appellation of the <HI>great captain,</HI>
to attack the armies of France, and make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of all the
dominions of Naples. Gon&s;alvo prevailed in every enterprize, defeated the
French in two pitched battles, and en&s;ured to his prince the entire
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that fine kingdom. Lewis, unable to procure redre&s;s by
force of arms, was obliged to enter into a fruitle&s;s negotiation with
Ferdinand for the recovery of his &s;hare of the partition; <PB N="74" REF="79"> and all Italy, during &s;ome time, was held in &s;u&s;pence between
the&s;e two power|ful monarchs.</P>
<P>THERE &s;carce has been any period, when the ballance of power
was better &s;ecured in Europe, and &s;eemed more able to maintain it&s;elf,
without any anxious concern or attention of the princes. Several great
monarchies were e&s;tabli&s;hed; and no one &s;o far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t
as to give any foundation, or even pretence, for jealou&s;y. England was united
in dome&s;tic peace, and by its &s;ituation happily &s;ecured from the
inva&s;ion of foreigners. The coalition of the &s;everal kingdoms of Spain, had
formed one powerful monarchy, which Ferdinand admini&s;tered with arts,
fraudulent indeed and deceitful, but full of vigour and ability. Lewis the
twelfth of France, a gallant and generous prince, by e&s;pou&s;ing Anne of
Britanny, widow to his predece&s;&s;or, had pre&s;erved the union with that
princi|pality, on which the &s;afety of his kingdom &s;o much depended.
Maximilian, the emperor, be&s;ides the hereditary dominions of the Au&s;trian
family, main|tained authority in the empire, and notwith&s;tanding his levity
of di&s;po&s;ition, was able to unite the German princes in any great plan of
intere&s;t, at lea&s;t, of de|fence. Charles, prince of Ca&s;tile, grand&s;on
to Maximilian and Ferdinand, had already &s;ucceeded to the rich dominions of
the hou&s;e of Burgundy; and being as yet in early youth, the government was
entru&s;ted to Margaret of Savoy, his aunt, a prince&s;s endowed with &s;ignal
prudence and virtue. The internal force of the&s;e &s;everal powerful &s;tates,
which ballanced each other, might long have maintained general tranquillity,
had not the active and enterprizing genius of an ambitious pontiff fir&s;t
excited the flames of war and di&s;cord among them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Julius the 2d.</NOTE> ALEXANDER the &s;ixth
was dead; a man of a &s;ingular character, and, except|ing his &s;on Cae&s;ar
Borgia, almo&s;t the only man who ever joined great capacity with the

&s;hort interval, Julius the &s;econd had &s;ucceeded to the papal throne, who,
tho' endowed with many virtues, gave almo&s;t as much &s;candal to the world as

of Arragon; and the object of this great confederacy was to overwhelm, by their
united arms, the commonwealth of Venice.</P>
<P>THIS illu&s;trious commonwealth, the great bulwark of Europe
again&s;t the Bar|barians, and the admired model of civil poli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y, had ri&s;en to a con&s;iderable
power, and began to make a figure, which during that age bore &s;ome proportion
to that of the great monarchies. Her riches &s;urpa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e of any
European city, her finances were great, her commerce exten&s;ive, her naval
power formidable, her armies numerous and well &s;upplied. Tru&s;ting only to
her own power, &s;he had neglected to maintain a cordial friend&s;hip with any
other &s;tate; and by the endle&s;s political &s;u&s;picions, which &s;he
entertained even of her allies, &s;he had taught them to regard her progre&s;s
with like jealou&s;y. No &s;tate could rea&s;onably complain of any inju&s;tice
and u&s;urpations in her mea&s;ures: But as great monarchs never &s;ee with|out
di&s;plea&s;ure a republic nearly on a level with them&s;elves, it was ea&s;y
for Julius, by his negotiations among the European princes, to compleat his
&s;cheme of a confederacy again&s;t her. Ferdinand de&s;ired to wre&s;t from
the Venetians &s;ome towns on the coa&s;t of Naples, which his predece&s;&s;or
had voluntarily, for money, con&s;igned into their hand: Lewis propo&s;ed to
recover a part of the territory of Milan, which he him&s;elf had delivered to
them by treaty: Maximilian laid claim to great part of their dominions, which
they had acquired from petty princes or tyrants, that had formerly, as he
pretended, in &s;ome di&s;tant period, u&s;urped them from the empire: The
pope, from like pretences, challenged ano|ther part of their dominions, as the
patrimony of the church. In order to cover the &s;ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">me of this confederacy, the cardinal d'Amboi&s;e, prime
mini&s;ter of France, had met at Cambray with Margaret of Savoy, under colour

Louis XII. St. Gelais, Guicciard. lib. 8.</NOTE>. Di&s;mayed with this lo&s;s,
the Venetians took a ha&s;ty re&s;olution of abandoning all their dominions on
the continent of Italy; and they accordingly withdrew their garri&s;ons from
every place, and freed their &s;ubjects from their oaths of allegiance. Lewis
immediately put him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cremona, Bergamo, Bre&s;cia,
Creme, and all the places which had been di&s;membered from the Milane&s;e.
Even Verona, Padua, Vicenza, and other towns, which, by the treaty of Cambray,
fell under the partition of Maximilian, offered to open their gates to the
French monarch. Had Maximilian, in&s;tead of wa&s;ting his time at Trent, led
his forces early into Italy, an end had been put for ever to the power and
dominion of Venice. But Lewis, well acquainted with the ficklene&s;s and
incon&s;tancy of that prince, was determined to give him no pretext for
de&s;erting his alliance; and therefore ordered the magi&s;trates of tho&s;e
towns to make their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the emperor, whom, he told them, they

<P>BUONAVISO, an agent of the pope at London, had been corrupted by
the court of France, and had previou&s;ly revealed to Lewis all the mea&s;ures
which Henry was concerting again&s;t him. But this infidelity did the King
incon&s;ide|rable prejudice, in compari&s;on of what he experienced from the
&s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es of the ally, to whom he chiefly tru&s;ted for
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Ferdinand, his father-in-law, had &s;o long per&s;evered in a
cour&s;e of crooked politics, that he began even to value him&s;elf on his
dexterity in fraud and artifice; and he made a boa&s;t of tho&s;e &s;hame|ful
&s;ucce&s;&s;es. Being told one day, that Lewis the twelfth, a prince of a very
different character, had complained that he had once cheated him: 
<Q REND="inline">"He lies, the drunkard!" &s;aid he, "I have
cheated him above twenty times."</Q> This prince con&s;idered his clo&s;e
connexion with Henry, only as the means which ena|bled him the better to take
advantage of his want of experience. He ad|vi&s;ed him not to invade France by
the way of Calais, where he him&s;elf would not have it in his power to
a&s;&s;i&s;t him: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expedition to Fontarabia.</NOTE> He exhorted
him rather to &s;end forces to Fon|tarabia, whence he could ea&s;ily make a
conque&s;t of Guienne, a province, in which, it was imagined, the Engli&s;h had
&s;till &s;ome adherents. He promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t this conque&s;t by the
junction of a Spani&s;h army. And &s;o forward did he &s;eem to promote the
intere&s;t of his &s;on-in-law, that he even &s;ent ve&s;&s;els into England,
to tran&s;port over the forces which Henry had levied for that purpo&s;e. The
marque&s;s of Dor&s;et commanded the&s;e troops, which con&s;i&s;ted of ten
thou&s;and men, mo&s;tly infantry; the lord Howard, &s;on to the earl of
Surrey, the lord Broke, lord Fer|rars, and many others of the young gentry and
nobility, accompanied him in this &s;ervice. All were on fire to
di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by military atchievements, and to make a
conque&s;t of importance for their ma&s;ter. The &s;ecret purpo&s;e of

<P><PB N="80" REF="85"> THE &s;mall kingdom of Navarre lies on the

favourable to Ferdinand, while the Engli&s;h forces were conjoined with his
own, and while all adherents to the council of Pi&s;a lay under the &s;entence
of excommunication, to put him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e

opened the way into Guienne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Holling&s;hed, p

the kingdom of Navarre, which, being in clo&s;e alliance with France, could
ea&s;ily give admittance to the enemy, and cut off all communication between
Spain and the combined armies. To provide again&s;t &s;o dangerous an event, he
required, that John &s;hould &s;tipulate a neutrality in the pre&s;ent war; and
when that prince expre&s;&s;ed his willingne&s;s to enter into any engagement
for that purpo&s;e, he al&s;o required that he &s;hould give &s;ecurity for his
&s;trict ob&s;ervance of it. John having likewi&s;e agreed to this condition,
Ferdinand demanded, that he &s;hould deliver into his hands &s;ix of the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable places of his dominions, together with his elde&s;t &s;on as a
ho&s;tage. The&s;e were not conditions to be propo&s;ed to a &s;overeign; and
as the Spani&s;h monarch expected a refu&s;al, he gave immediate orders to the
duke of Alva, his general, to make an inva&s;ion of Navarre, and to reduce the
whole kingdom to &s;ubjection. Alva &s;oon made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of all the
&s;maller towns; and being ready to form the &s;iege of Pampeluna, the capital,
he &s;ummoned the marquis of Dor&s;et to join him with the Engli&s;h army, and
to concert together all their operations.</P>
<P>DORSET began to &s;u&s;pect, that his ma&s;ter's intere&s;ts
were very little regarded in all the&s;e tran&s;actions; and having no orders
to invade the kingdom of Navarre, or make war any where but in France, he
refu&s;ed to take any part in that enter|prize .<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deceit of
Fer|dinand.</NOTE> He remained therefore in his quarters at Fontarabia; but
&s;o politic was the contrivance of Ferdinand, that even while the Engli&s;h
army lay in that &s;itu|ation, it was almo&s;t equally &s;erviceable to his
purpo&s;es, as if it had acted in con|junction with his own. It kept the French
army in awe, and prevented it from advancing to &s;uccour the kingdom of
Navarre; &s;o that Alva, having full lei&s;ure to conduct the &s;iege, made
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Pampeluna, and obliged John to &s;eek for &s;helter in
France. The Spani&s;h general applied again to Dor&s;et, and pro|po&s;ed to
conduct with united councils the operations of the <HI>holy league,</HI> &s;o
it was called, again&s;t Lewis: But as he &s;till declined forming the &s;iege
of Bayonne, and rather in&s;i&s;ted on the inva&s;ion of the principality of
Bearne, a part of the King <PB N="81" REF="86"> of Navarre's dominions, which
lies on the French &s;ide of the Pyrences, Dor&s;et, ju&s;tly &s;u&s;picious of
his &s;ini&s;ter intentions, repre&s;ented, that, without new orders from his
ma&s;ter, he could not concur in &s;uch an undertaking. In order to pro|cure
&s;uch orders, Ferdinand di&s;patched Martin de Ampios, as his envoy, to
Lon|don; and per&s;waded Henry, that, by the refractory and &s;crupulous humour
of the Engli&s;h general, the mo&s;t favourable opportunities were lo&s;t, and
that it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould, in all things, act in concert with the
Spani&s;h commander, who was be&s;t acquainted with the &s;ituation of the
country, and the rea&s;ons of every operation. But before orders to this
purpo&s;e reached Spain, Dor&s;et had become extremely impatient; and
ob&s;erving that his farther &s;tay &s;erved not to promote the main
undertaking, and that his army was daily peri&s;hing by want and &s;ickne&s;s,
he demanded &s;hipping from Ferdinand to tran&s;port them back into England.
Ferdinand, who was bound by treaty to furni&s;h him with this &s;upply,
whenever demanded, was at la&s;t, after many delays, obliged to yield to his
im|portunity; and Dor&s;et embarked his troops, and prepared him&s;elf for the
voyage. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Return of the Engli&s;h.</NOTE> Mean while, a

<P>HENRY, all on fire for military
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ame, was little di&s;couraged by
this appearance of a diver&s;ion from the North; and &s;o much the le&s;s, that
he flattered him&s;elf with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all the con&s;iderable
potentates of Europe in his inva&s;ion of France. The pope &s;till continued to
thunder out his excommunications again&s;t Lewis, and all the adherents to the
&s;chi&s;matical council: The Swi&s;s cantons made profe&s;&s;ions of the
mo&s;t violent animo&s;ity again&s;t France: The amba&s;&s;adors of Ferdinand
and Maximilian had &s;igned with tho&s;e of Henry a treaty of alliance
again&s;t that power, and had &s;tipulated the time and place of their intended
inva|&s;ion: And though Ferdinand di&s;avowed his amba&s;&s;ador, and even
&s;igned a truce for a twelvemonth with the common enemy; Henry was not yet
fully con|vinced of his &s;elfi&s;h and &s;ini&s;ter intentions, and &s;till
hoped for his concurrence after the expiration of that term. He had now got a
mini&s;ter who complied with all his inclinations, and flattered him in every

&s;atisfaction, and obtained the prai&s;e both of diligence and dexterity in
his conduct<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cavendi&s;h, Fiddes's life of

&s;uppo&s;ing that he had protracted his departure, he began to reprove him for
the dilatory execution of his orders. Wol&s;ey informed him, that he was ju&s;t
returned from Bru&s;&s;els, and had &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully fulfilled all his
maje&s;ty's commands.

him as one, who might be &s;erviceable to him in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Brit. Ecle&s;. p. 309. Polydore Virgil, lib.

eclip&s;ed him in favour, re&s;olved to introduce Wol&s;ey into the young

in&s;inuating arts, and yet be contented to act in the cabinet a part
&s;ubordinate to Fox him&s;elf, who had promoted him. In a very little time,
Wol&s;ey gained &s;o much on Henry's good graces, that he &s;upplanted both
Surrey in his favour, and Fox in his tru&s;t and confidence. Being admitted to
the King's parties of plea&s;ure, he took the lead in every jovial
conver&s;ation, and promoted all that frolic and entertainment, which he found
&s;uitable to the age and inclination of the young monarch. Nei|ther his own
years, which were near forty, nor his character of a clergyman, were any
re&s;traint upon him, or engaged him to check, by any u&s;ele&s;s &s;everity,
the gaiety, in which Henry, who had &s;mall propen&s;ion to debauchery,
pa&s;&s;ed his carele&s;s hours. During the intervals of amu&s;ement he
introduced bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;tate affairs, and in&s;inuated tho&s;e maxims of
conduct, which he was de&s;irous his ma&s;ter &s;hould adopt. He ob&s;erved to
him, that, while he entru&s;ted his affairs into the hands of his father's
coun&s;ellors, he had the advantage of employing men of wi&s;dom and
experience, but men who owed not their promotion to his fa|vour, and who
&s;carce thought them&s;elves accountable to him for the exerci&s;e of their
authority: That by the factions, and cabals, and jealou&s;ies, which pre|vailed
among them, they more ob&s;tructed the advancement of his affairs, than they
promoted it by the knowledge which age and practice had conferred upon them:
That while he thought proper to pa&s;s his time in tho&s;e plea&s;ures, to
which his age and royal fortune invited him, and in tho&s;e &s;tudies, which
would in time enable him to &s;way the &s;cepter with ab&s;olute authority, his
be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment would be to intru&s;t his authority into the
hands of &s;ome one per&s;on, who was the creature of his will, and who could
entertain no view but of promoting his &s;ervice: And that if this mini&s;ter
had al&s;o the &s;ame reli&s;h for plea&s;ure with him|&s;elf, and the &s;ame
ta&s;te for &s;cience; he could the more ea&s;ily account to him for his whole

<P><PB N="86" REF="91"> HENRY entered into all the views of
Wol&s;ey; and finding no one &s;o capable of executing this plan of

favourite, from being the companion of his carele&s;s hours, to be a member of
his council; and from being a member of his council, to be his &s;ole and
ab&s;olute mini&s;ter. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His character.</NOTE> By this rapid
advancement and uncontrouled autho|rity, the character and genius of Wol&s;ey
had full opportunity to di&s;play it&s;elf. In&s;atiable in his acqui&s;itions,
but &s;till more magnificent in his expence: Of ex|ten&s;ive capacity, but
&s;till more unbounded enterprize: Ambitious of power, but &s;till more
de&s;irous of glory: In&s;inuating, engaging, per&s;ua&s;ive; and, by turns,
lofty, elevated, commanding: Haughty to his equals, but affable to his

generous than grateful; le&s;s moved by injuries than by contempt; he &s;eemed
framed to take the a&s;cendant in every intercour&s;e with others, but exerted
this &s;uperiority of <HI>nature</HI> with &s;uch o&s;tentation as expo&s;ed
him to envy, and made every one willing to recal the original inferiority or
rather meanne&s;s of his <HI>fortune.</HI></P>
<P>THE branch of admini&s;tration, in which Henry mo&s;t exerted
him&s;elf, while he gave his entire confidence to Wol&s;ey, was the military,
which, as it &s;uited the natural gallantry and bravery of his temper, as well
as the ardour of his youth, was the principal object of his attention. Finding,
that Lewis had made great preparations both by &s;ea and land to re&s;i&s;t
him, he was no le&s;s careful to rai&s;e a formidable army and equip a
con&s;iderable fleet for the inva&s;ion of France. The command of the fleet was
entru&s;ted to Sir Edward Howard; who, after &s;couring the channel &s;ome
time, pre&s;ented him&s;elf before Bre&s;t, where the French navy then lay; and
he challenged them to a combat. The French admiral, who ex|pected from the
Mediterranean a reinforcement of &s;ome Gallies under the com|mand of Prejeant
de Bidoux, kept within the harbour, and &s;aw with patience the Engli&s;h burn
and de&s;troy the country in the neighbourhood. At la&s;t Prejeant arrived with
&s;ix gallies, and put into Conquet, a place within a few leagues of Bre&s;t,
where he &s;ecured him&s;elf behind &s;ome batteries, which he had planted on
rocks, that lay on each &s;ide of him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th April.</NOTE> Howard was
notwith&s;tanding determined to make an attack; and as he had but two gallies,
he took him&s;elf the command of one, and gave the other to Devereux lord
Ferrars. He was followed by &s;ome row-barges and &s;ome crayers under the
command of Sir Thomas Cheyney, Sir William Sidney, and other officers of
di&s;tinction. He immediately fa&s;tened on Prejeant's &s;hip, and leaped on
board of her, attended with one Carroz, a Spa|ni&s;h cavalier, and &s;eventeen
Engli&s;h more. The cable, meanwhile, which fa&s;tened his &s;hip to that of
the enemy, being cut, the admiral was thus left in the hands of the French; and
as he &s;till continued the fight with great gallantry, he was 
<PB N="87" REF="92"> pu&s;hed overboard by their pikes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was a maxim of Howard's, that no admiral was good for any
thing, that was not brave even to a degree of madne&s;s. As the &s;ea-&s;ervice
requires much le&s;s plan and contrivance and capacity than the land, this
maxim has great plau&s;ibility and appearance of truth: Tho' the fate of Howard
him&s;elf may &s;erve as a proof that even there courage ought to be tempered
with di&s;cretion.</NOTE>. Lord Ferrars, &s;eeing the admiral's galley fall
off, followed with the other ve&s;&s;els; and the whole fleet was &s;o
di&s;couraged by the lo&s;s of their admiral, that they retired from before
Bre&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 491. Herbert, Holling&s;hed,

invade the coa&s;t of Su&s;&s;ex. They were repul&s;ed, and Prejeant, their
admiral, lo&s;t an eye by the &s;hot of an arrow. Lord Howard, brother to the
decea&s;ed admiral, received the command of the Engli&s;h fleet; and little
memorable pa&s;&s;ed at &s;ea during this &s;ummer.</P>
<P>GREAT preparations had been making at land, during the whole
winter, for an inva&s;ion of France by the way of Calais; but the &s;ummer was
well advanced before every thing was in &s;ufficient readine&s;s for the
intended enterprize. The long peace, which the kingdom had enjoyed, had
&s;omewhat unfitted the Engli&s;h for military expeditions; and the great
change, which had lately been introduced in the art of war, had rendered it
&s;till more difficult to inure them to the u&s;e of the weapons now employed
in action. The Swi&s;s, and after them the Spaniards, had &s;hown the advantage
of a &s;table infantry, who fought with pike and &s;word, and were able to
repul&s;e even the heavy-armed cavalry, in which the great force of the armies
formerly con&s;i&s;ted. The practice of fire-arms was become very common; tho'
the caliver, which was the weapon now u&s;ed, was &s;o inconvenient, and
attended with &s;o many di&s;advantages, that it had not entirely di&s;credited
the u&s;e of bows, a weapon in which the Engli&s;h excelled all European
nations. The Engli&s;h archers &s;till maintained their reputation; and even
during the pre&s;ent reign, the king's allies had &s;ollicited him for
&s;upplies of this kind. The &s;econd year after his acce&s;&s;ion, he &s;ent a
thou&s;and archers, under the command of lord Dacres, to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of Ferdinand, his father-in-law, in his projected expe|dition again&s;t the
Moors of Barbary; but as that prince turned his arms again&s;t the French in
Italy, Darcy was &s;ent back without being employed in any &s;ervice. The King
had al&s;o &s;ent fifteen hundred archers under the command of Sir Edward
Poinings to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Margaret, dutche&s;s of Savoy, who made
u&s;e of them with great advantage again&s;t the duke of Guelders, the great
di&s;turber of the Netherlands. A con&s;iderable part of the forces, which
Henry now levied for the inva&s;ion of France, con&s;i&s;ted al&s;o of archers;
and &s;o &s;oon as affairs were in readine&s;s, the vanguard of the army,
amounting to 8000 men, under the com|mand of the earl of Shrew&s;bury, &s;ailed
over to Calais. Shrew&s;bury was accom|panied <PB N="88" REF="93"> with the
earl of Derby, the lords Fitzwater, Ha&s;tings, Cobham, and Sir Rice ap Thomas,
captain of the light hor&s;e. Another Body of 6000 men &s;oon after followed
under the command of lord Herbert, the chamberlain, attended with the earls of
Northumberland and Kent, the lords Audley and Delawar, together with Carew,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ur&s;on, and other gentlemen.</P>
<P>THE King him&s;elf prepared to follow with the main body and
rear of the army; and he appointed the queen regent of the kingdom during his
ab&s;ence. That he might &s;ecure her admini&s;tration from all di&s;turbance,
he ordered Edmond de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, to be beheaded in the Tower, the
nobleman who had been attainted and impri&s;oned during the late reign. The
King was led to com|mit this act of violence by the dying commands, as is
imagined, of his father, who told him, that he never would be free from danger,
while a man of &s;o tur|bulent a di&s;po&s;ition as Suffolk was alive. And as
his brother, Richard de la Pole, had accepted of a command in the French
&s;ervice, and attempted very fooli&s;hly to revive the York faction, and to
animate them again&s;t Henry, he probably drew more &s;uddenly the King's
vengeance on the unhappy Suffolk.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of June.</NOTE> AT la&s;t, Henry,
attended with the duke of Buckingham and many others of the nobility, arrived
in Calais, and entered upon his French expedition, whence he fondly expected
&s;o much &s;ucce&s;s and glory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib.

a&s;&s;i&s;tance he &s;o much relied, the Swi&s;s alone fully performed their
engagements. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion of France.</NOTE> Being put in
motion by a &s;um of money &s;ent them by Henry, and incited by their victories
obtained in Italy, and by their animo&s;ity again&s;t France, they were
prepar|ing to enter that kingdom with an army of twenty-five thou&s;and men;
and no equal force could be oppo&s;ed to their incur&s;ion. Maximilian had
received an advance of 120,000 crowns from Henry, and had engaged to reinforce
the Swi&s;s with 8000 men, but failed in his engagements. That he might make
atone|ment to the King, he him&s;elf appeared in the Low Countries, and joined
the Engli&s;h army with &s;ome German and Flemi&s;h &s;oldiers, who were
u&s;eful in giving an example of di&s;cipline to Henry's new-levied forces.
Ob&s;erving the di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h monarch to be more bent on
glory than on intere&s;t, he inli&s;ted him&s;elf in his &s;ervice, wore the
cro&s;s of St. George, and received pay, a hundred crowns day, as one of his
&s;ubjects and captains. But while he exhibited this ex|traordinary
&s;pectacle, of an emperor of Germany &s;erving under a King of Eng|land, he
was treated with the highe&s;t re&s;pect by Henry, and really directed all the
operations of the combined army.</P>
<P>BEFORE the arrival of Henry and Maximilian in the camp, the earl
of Shrew&s;|bury and lord Herbert had formed the &s;iege of Tero&uuml;ane, a
town &s;ituate on <PB N="89" REF="94"> the frontiers of Picardy; and they began
to attack the place with vigour. Teligini and Crequi commanded in the town, and
had a garri&s;on, which exceeded not a thou&s;and men; yet made they &s;uch
&s;tout re&s;i&s;tance as protracted the &s;iege a month; and they found
them&s;elves at la&s;t more in danger from want of pro|vi&s;ions and ammunition
than from the a&s;&s;aults of the be&s;iegers. Having con|veyed intelligence of
their &s;ituation to Lewis, who had advanced to Amiens with his army, that
prince gave orders to throw relief into the place. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th Augu&s;t.</NOTE> Fontrailles appeared at
the head of 800 hor&s;emen, each of whom carried a &s;ack of gun|powder behind
him, and two quarters of bacon. With this &s;mall force he made a &s;udden and
unexpected irruption into the Engli&s;h camp, and &s;urmounting all
re&s;i&s;tance, advanced&punc; to the fo&s;&s;ee of the town, where each
hor&s;eman threw down his burthen. They immediately returned at the gallop, and
were &s;o fortunate as again to break thro' the Engli&s;h, and to receive
little or no lo&s;s, in this dan|gerous attempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Gui|negate.</NOTE> BUT the
Engli&s;h had, &s;oon after, full revenge for that in&s;ult. Henry had
re|ceived intelligence of the approach of the French Hor&s;e, who had advanced
to protect this incur&s;ion of Fontrailles; and he ordered &s;ome troops to
pa&s;s the Lis, in order to oppo&s;e them. The cavalry of France, tho' they
con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of gentlemen, who had behaved with great valour in many
de&s;perate actions in Italy, were, on &s;ight of the enemy, &s;eized with &s;o
unaccountable a panic, that they immediately took to flight, and were pur&s;ued
by the Engli&s;h. The duke of Longueville, who commanded the French, Bu&s;&s;i
d'Amboi&s;e, Clermont, Im|bercourt, the chevalier Bayard, and many other
officers of di&s;tinction were taken pri&s;oners<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Bellai&punc; liv. 1. Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.
Holling&s;hed, p. 822. Herbert.</NOTE>. This action, or rather rout, is
&s;ometimes called the battle of Guinegate, from the place where it was fought;
but more commonly the <HI>battle of Spurs,</HI> becau&s;e the French, that day,
made more u&s;e of their &s;purs than of their &s;words or military
weapons.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;o con&s;iderable an advantage, the King, who was at the
head of a compleat army of above 50,000 men, might have made incur&s;ions to
the gates of Paris, and &s;pread confu&s;ion and de&s;olation every where. It
gave Lewis great joy, when he heard, that the Engli&s;h, in&s;tead of pu&s;hing
their victory, and at|tacking the di&s;mayed troops of France, returned to the
&s;iege of an incon&s;iderable place like Tero&uuml;ane. The governors were
obliged &s;oon after to &s;urrender the town; and Henry found his acqui&s;ition
of &s;o little con&s;equence, tho' gained at the expence of &s;ome blood, and
what, in his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, was more important, of much valuable
time, that he immediately demoli&s;hed the fortifi|cations. <PB N="90" REF="95"> The anxieties of the French were again renewed with regard to the
motions of the Engli&s;h. The Swi&s;s at the &s;ame time had entered Burgundy
with a very formidable army, and laid &s;iege to Dijon, which was in no
condition to re&s;i&s;t them. Ferdinand him&s;elf, tho' he had made a truce
with Lewis, &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to lay hold of every advantage which fortune
&s;hould pre&s;ent to him. Scarce ever was the French monarchy in greater
danger, or le&s;s in a condition to defend it&s;elf again&s;t tho&s;e powerful
armies, which on every &s;ide a&s;&s;ailed or threatened it. Even many of the
inhabitants of Paris, who believed them&s;elves expo&s;ed to the rapacity and
violence of the enemy, began to di&s;lodge, without knowing what place could
afford them greater &s;afety and protection.</P>
<P>BUT Lewis was extricated from his pre&s;ent difficulties by the
manife&s;t blunders of his enemies. The Swi&s;s allowed them&s;elves to be
&s;educed into a negotiation by Tremo&uuml;ille, governor of Burgundy; and
without making enquiry, whether he had any powers to treat, they accepted of
the conditions which he offered them. Tremo&uuml;ille, who knew, that he would
be di&s;avowed by his ma&s;ter, &s;tipulated whatever they were plea&s;ed to
demand; and thought him&s;elf happy, at the expence of &s;ome payments, and
very large promi&s;es, to get rid of &s;o for|midable an enemy<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Memoires du mare&s;chal de Fleuranges Beliarius, lib.

<P>THE mea&s;ures of Henry &s;howed equal ignorance in the art of
war with tho&s;e of the Swi&s;s in negotiation. Tournay was a great and rich
city, which, tho' it lay within the frontiers of Flanders, belonged entirely to
France, and afforded the troops of that kingdom a pa&s;&s;age into the middle
of the Netherlands. Maximi|lian, who was de&s;irous to free his grand&s;on from
&s;o trouble&s;ome a neighbourhood, advi&s;ed Henry to lay &s;iege to this
place; and the Engli&s;h monarch, not con|&s;idering that &s;uch an
acqui&s;ition no way advanced his conque&s;ts in France, was &s;o imprudent as
to follow this intere&s;ted council. The city of Tournay, by its an|tient
charters, being exempted from the burthen of a garri&s;on, the burghers, even
again&s;t the remon&s;trance of their &s;overeign, &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted
on maintain|ing this dangerous privilege; and they engaged, by them&s;elves, to
make a vigo|rous defence again&s;t the enemy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires

extremity; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th Septem|ber.</NOTE> and after a few days
&s;iege, the place was &s;urrendered to the Eng|li&s;h. Henry &s;o little
regarded its privileges, that he immediately quartered a garri&s;on in it,
under the command of Sir Edward Poinings. The bi&s;hop of Tournay was lately
dead; and as a new bi&s;hop was already elected by the chapter, but not
in&s;talled in his office, the King be&s;towed the admini&s;tration of the
&s;ee on his favourite, Wol&s;ey, and put him in immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the <PB N="91" REF="96"> revenues, which were con&s;iderable<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memorials, vol. 1. p. 5, 6.</NOTE>. Hearing
of the retreat of the Swi&s;s, and ob&s;erving the &s;ea&s;on to be far

greate&s;t part of his army with him. Succe&s;s had at|tended him in every
enterprize; and his youthful mind was much elated with this &s;eeming
pro&s;perity; but all men of judgment, comparing the advantages of his
&s;ituation with his progre&s;s, his expences with his acqui&s;itions, were
convinced, that this campaign, &s;o much vaunted, was, in reality, both ruinous
and in|glorious<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cuicciardini.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s, which, during this &s;ummer, had attended
Henry's arms in the north, was much more deci&s;ive. The King of Scotland had
&s;ummoned out the whole force of his kingdom; and having pa&s;&s;ed the Tweed
with a brave, tho' a tumultuary army of above 50,000 men, he ravaged tho&s;e
parts of Northum|berland which lay neare&s;t that river, and employed him&s;elf
in taking the ca&s;tles of Norham, Etal, Werke, Ford, and other places of
little importance. The lady Ford, a woman of great beauty, being taken
pri&s;oner in her ca&s;tle, was pre&s;ented to James, and &s;o gained on the
affections of that monarch, that he wa&s;ted in idle plea&s;ure that critical
time, which, during the ab&s;ence of his enemy, he &s;hould have employed in
pu&s;hing his conque&s;ts. His troops, lying in a barren country, where they
&s;oon con&s;umed all the provi&s;ions, began to be pinched with nece&s;&s;ity;
and as the authority of the prince was feeble, and mili|tary di&s;cipline,
during that age, extremely relaxed, many of them had &s;tolen from the camp,
and retired to their hou&s;es. Mean while, the earl of Surrey, having collected
a force of 26,000 men, of which 5000 had been &s;ent over from the King's army
in France, marched to the defence of the country, and approached the Scotch,
who lay on &s;ome high ground near the hills of Cheviot. The river Till ran
between the armies, and prevented an engagement: Surrey therefore &s;ent a
herald to the Scotch camp, challenging them to de&s;cend into the plain of
Milfield, which lay towards the &s;outh; and there, appointing a day for the
combat, try their valour on equal ground. As he received no &s;atisfactory
an|&s;wer, he made a feint of marching towards Berwic; as if he intended to
enter Scotland, to lay wa&s;te the borders, and cut off the provi&s;ions of the
enemy. The Scotch army, in order to prevent his purpo&s;e, put them&s;elves in
motion; and having &s;et fire to the huts in which they had quartered, they
de&s;cended from the hills. Surrey, taking advantage of the &s;moke, which was
blown towards him, and which covered his movements, pa&s;&s;ed the Till with
his artillery and vanguard at the bridge of Twi&s;el, and &s;ent the re&s;t of
his army to find a &s;ord farther up the river.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Flou|den.</NOTE> The Engli&s;h
divided their army into two lines: Lord Howard led the main body of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;t line, Sir Edmond Howard the
right wing, Sir Marmaduke Con&s;table the left. The earl of Surrey him&s;elf
commanded the main body of the &s;econd line, lord Dacres the right wing, Sir
Edward Stanley the left. The Scotch front pre&s;ented three divi&s;ions to the
enemy: The middle was led by the King him&s;elf: The right by the earl of
Huntley, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by lord Hume: The left by the earls of Lenox and
Argyle. A fourth divi&s;ion under the earl of Bothwel made a body of
re|&s;erve. Huntley began the battle; and after a &s;harp conflict, put to
flight the left wing of the Engli&s;h, and chaced them off the field: But on
returning from the pur&s;uit, he found the whole Scotch army in great
di&s;order. The divi&s;ion under Lenox and Argyle, elated with the &s;ucce&s;s
of the other wing, had broke their ranks, and notwith&s;tanding the
remon&s;trances and entreaties of La Motte, the French amba&s;&s;ador, had
ru&s;hed headlong upon the enemy. Not only Sir Edmond Howard, at the head of
his divi&s;ion, received them with great valour; but Dacres, who commanded in
the &s;econd line, wheeling about during the action, fell upon their rear, and
put them to the &s;word without re&s;i&s;tance. The divi&s;ion under the King
him&s;elf and that under Bothwel, animated by the valour of their leaders,
&s;till made head again&s;t the Engli&s;h, and throwing them&s;elves into a
circle, protracted the action till night &s;eparated the combatants. The
victory &s;eemed yet uncertain, and the numbers which fell on each &s;ide were
nearly equal, amounting to above 5000 men: But the morning di&s;covered
evi|dently where the advantage lay. The Engli&s;h had lo&s;t only per&s;ons of
&s;mall note; but the flower of the Scotch nobility had fallen in battle, and
the King him&s;elf, after the mo&s;t diligent enquiry, could no where be found.
In &s;earching the field, the Engli&s;h met with a dead body, which re&s;embled
him, and was arrayed in a &s;imilar habit; and they put it in a lead coffin and
&s;ent it to London. Dur|ing &s;ome time it was kept unburied; becau&s;e James
died under &s;entence of ex|communication, on account of his confederacy with
France, and his oppo&s;ition to the holy &s;ee<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Buchannan, lib. 13. Herbert.</NOTE>: But upon Henry's application,
who pretended that that prince, in the in&s;tant before his death, had
di&s;covered &s;igns of repentance, ab&s;olution was given him, and his body
was interred. The Scotch, however, &s;till a&s;&s;erted, that it was not
James's body, which was found in the field of battle, but that of one
Elphin&s;ton, who had been arrayed in arms re&s;embling the King's, in or|der
to divide the attention of the Engli&s;h, and &s;hare the danger with his
ma&s;ter. <PB N="93" REF="98"> It was believed that James had been &s;een
cro&s;&s;ing the Tweed at Kel&s;o; and &s;ome imagined that he had been killed
by the clients of lord Hume, whom that noble|man had in&s;tigated to commit
&s;o enormous a crime. But the populace enter|tained the opinion, that he was
&s;till alive, and having gone &s;ecretly in pilgrimage to the holy land, would
&s;oon return, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. This fond conceit was
long entertained in Scotland.</P>
<P>THE King of Soots and mo&s;t of the chief nobility being killed
in the field of Flouden, &s;o this battle was called, a very inviting
opportunity was offered to Henry of gaining advantages over that kingdom,
perhaps of reducing it to &s;ubjection. But he di&s;covered on this occa&s;ion
a mind truly great and generous. When the queen of Scotland, Margaret, who was
created regent during the infancy of her &s;on, applied for peace, he readily
granted it; and took compa&s;&s;ion of the helple&s;s condition of his
&s;i&s;ter and nephew. <MILESTONE N="1514" UNIT="year"> The earl of Surrey,
who had gained him &s;o great a victory, he re&s;tored to the title of Duke of
Norfolk, which had been forfeited by his father, for engaging on the &s;ide of
Richard the third. His &s;on, lord Howard, was honoured with the title of earl
of Surrey. Sir Charles Brandon, his favourite, whom he had before created
vi&s;count Li&s;le, was now rai&s;ed to the dignity of duke of Suffolk.
Wol&s;ey, who was both his favourite and his mini&s;ter, was created bi&s;hop
of Lincoln. Lord Herbert ob|tained the title of earl of Worce&s;ter. Sir Edward
Stanley, that of lord Mont|eagle.</P>
<P>THO' peace with Scotland gave Henry &s;ecurity towards the
north, and enabled him to pro&s;ecute in tranquility his enterprize again&s;t
France, &s;ome other inci|dents had happened, which more than counterballanced
this fortunate event, and &s;erved to open his eyes with regard to the
ra&s;hne&s;s of an undertaking, into which his youth and high fortune had
betrayed him.</P>
<P>LEWIS, fully &s;en&s;ible of the dangerous &s;ituation to which
his kingdom had been reduced during the former campaign, was re&s;olved, by
every expedient, to prevent the return of like perils, and to break the
confederacy of his enemies. The pope was no way di&s;po&s;ed to pu&s;h the
French to extremity; and provided they returned not to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Milan, his intere&s;t rather led him to pre|&s;erve the ballance among the
contending parties. He accepted therefore of Lewis's offer to renounce the
council of Lyons; and he took off the excommu|nication which his
predece&s;&s;or and him&s;elf had denounced again&s;t that King and his
kingdom. Ferdinand was now fa&s;t declining in years, and as he entertained no
farther ambition than that of keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Navarre, which he
had &s;ubdued by his arms and policy, he readily hearkened to the propo&s;als
of Lewis for prolonging the truce another year; and he even &s;howed an
inclination of <PB N="94" REF="99"> forming a more intimate connexion with that
monarch. Lewis had dro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t hints of
his intention to marry his &s;econd daughter, Ren&eacute;e, either to Charles,
prince of Spain, or his brother, Ferdinand, both of them grandchildren to the
Spani&s;h monarch; and he declared his re&s;olution of be&s;towing on her, as
her portion, his claim to the dutchy of Milan. Ferdinand not only embraced
the&s;e &s;chemes with avidity; but al&s;o engaged the emperor, Maximilian, in
the &s;ame views, and procured his con&s;ent to a treaty, which opened &s;o
inviting a pro&s;pect of aggran|dizing their common grandchildren.</P>
<P>WHEN Henry was informed of Ferdinand's renewal of the truce with
Lewis, he fell into the mo&s;t violent rage, and loudly complained, that his
father-in-law had fir&s;t, by the highe&s;t promi&s;es and profe&s;&s;ions,
engaged him in enmity with France, and afterwards, without giving him the
lea&s;t warning, had now again &s;acrificed his intere&s;t to his own
&s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es, and had left him expo&s;ed alone to all the dangers and
expences of the war. In proportion to his ea&s;y credulity and un&s;u&s;pecting
reliance on Ferdinand, was the vehemence with which he ex|claimed again&s;t the
treatment, which he met with; and he threatened revenge for this egregious
treachery and breach of Faith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria,
Epi&s;. 545, 546.</NOTE>. But he lo&s;t all patience when informed of the other
negotiation, where Maximilian was al&s;o &s;educed from his alliance, and where
propo&s;als had been hearkened to, for the marriage of the prince of Spain with
the daughter of France. Charles, during the life-time of the late King, had
been affianced to Mary, Henry's &s;econd &s;i&s;ter; and as the prince now
approached the age of puberty, the King had expected the immediate completion
of the marriage, and the honourable &s;ettlement of a fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">er, for whom he had entertained a very tender affection.
Such a complication, there|fore, of injuries gave him the highe&s;t
di&s;plea&s;ure, and in&s;pired him with a de&s;ire of expre&s;&s;ing his
di&s;dain towards tho&s;e who had taken advantage of his youth and
inexperience, and had abu&s;ed his too great facility.</P>
<P>THE duke of Longueville, who had been made pri&s;oner at the
battle of Guine|gate, and who was &s;till detained in England, was ready to
take advantage of all the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of Henry, in order to procure a
peace and even an alliance, which he knew to be &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired
by his ma&s;ter. He repre&s;ented to the King, that Anne, queen of France,
being lately dead, a door was thereby opened for an affinity, which might tend
to the advantage of both kingdoms, and which would &s;erve to terminate
honourably all the differences between them: That &s;he had left Lewis no male
children; and as he had ever entertained a &s;trong de&s;ire of having heirs to
the crown, no marriage &s;eemed more &s;uitable to him than that with the 
<PB N="95" REF="100"> prince&s;s of England, who&s;e youth and beauty afforded
the mo&s;t flattering hopes in that particular: That tho' the marriage of a
prince&s;s of &s;ixteen, with a King of fifty three, might &s;eem un&s;uitable;
yet the other advantages, attending the alliance, were more than a &s;ufficient
compen&s;ation for this inequality: And that Henry, in loo&s;ening his
connexions with Spain, whence he had never experienced any advantage, would
contract a clo&s;e affinity with Lewis, a prince, who, thro' his whole life,
had invariably maintained the character of probity and honour.</P>
<P>AS Henry &s;eemed to hearken to this di&s;cour&s;e with very
willing ears, Longue|ville informed his ma&s;ter of the probability, which he
di&s;covered, of bringing this matter to a happy conclu&s;ion; and he received
full powers for negotiating the treaty. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of Augu&s;t.</NOTE> The articles were
ea&s;ily adju&s;ted between the monarchs. Lewis agreed that Tournay &s;hould
remain in the hands of the Engli&s;h; that Richard de la Pole &s;hould be
bani&s;hed to Metz, there to live on a pen&s;ion a&s;&s;igned him by Lewis;
that Henry &s;hould receive payment of a million of crowns, being the arrears
due by treaty to his father and him&s;elf; and that the prince&s;s Mary
&s;hould bring four hundred thou&s;and crowns as her portion, and enjoy as
large a jointure as any queen of France, even the former, who was heire&s;s of
Britanny. The two princes al&s;o &s;tipulated the &s;uccours, with which they
&s;hould mutually &s;upply each other, in ca&s;e either of them was attacked by
any enemy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Tillet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of Octo|ber.</NOTE> IN con&s;equence of
this treaty, Mary was &s;ent over to France with a &s;plendid retinue, and
Lewis met her at Abbeville, where the e&s;pou&s;als were celebrated. He was
enchanted with the beauty, grace, and numerous accompli&s;hments of the young
prince&s;s; and being naturally of an amorous di&s;po&s;ition, which his
advanced age had not entirely cooled, he was &s;educed into &s;uch a cour&s;e
of gaiety and plea|&s;ure, as proved very un&s;uitable to his declining &s;tate
of health<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Brantome Eloge de Louis XII.</NOTE>.
<MILESTONE N="1515" UNIT="year"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t of Janu|ary.</NOTE> He died in le&s;s

<P>FRANCIS, duke of Angouleme, a youth of one and twenty, who had
married Lewis's elde&s;t daughter, &s;ucceeded him on the throne; and by his
activity, valour, genero&s;ity, and other virtues, gave progno&s;tics of a
happy and glorious reign. This young monarch had been extremely &s;truck with
the charms of the Engli&s;h prince&s;s; and even during his predece&s;&s;or's
life-time, had payed her &s;uch clo&s;e attendance, as made &s;ome of his
friends apprehend that he had entertained views of gallantry towards her. But
being warned, that, by indulging him&s;elf in this pa&s;&s;ion, he might
readily exclude his own title to the throne, he fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">bore all <PB N="96" REF="101"> farther addre&s;&s;es;
and even watched the young dowages with a very careful eye during the fir&s;t
months of her widowhood. Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, was at that time in
the court of France, the mo&s;t comely per&s;onage of his time, and the mo&s;t
accompli&s;hed in all the exerci&s;es, which were then thought to be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">t a courtier and a &s;oldier. He was
Henry's chief favourite; and that monarch had even once entertained thoughts of
marrying him to his &s;i&s;ter, and had given indul|gence to that mutual
pa&s;&s;ion, which took place between them. The queen a&s;ked Suffolk, whether
he had now the courage, without farther reflection, to e&s;pou&s;e her; and
&s;he told him, that her brother would more ea&s;ily forgive him for not
a&s;king his con&s;ent, than for acting contrary to his orders. Suffolk
declined not &s;o inviting an offer; and the marriage was &s;ecretly compleated
at Paris. Francis, who was plea&s;ed with this marriage, as it prevented Henry
from forming any powerful alliance by means of his &s;i&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria, Epi&s;t. 544.</NOTE>, interpo&s;ed his good
offices in appealing him: And even Wol&s;ey, having entertained no jealou&s;y
of Suffolk, who was content to participate in the King's plea&s;ures, and had
no ambition to interpo&s;e in &s;tate affairs, was active in reconciling the
King to his &s;i&s;ter and brother-in-law; and he obtained them permi&s;&s;ion
to return to England.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wol&s;ey's ad|mini&s;tration.</NOTE> THE
numerous enemies, whom Wol&s;ey's &s;udden elevation, his a&s;piring character,
and his haughty deportment had rai&s;ed, &s;erved only to rivet him fa&s;ter in
Henry's confidence; who placed a pride in &s;upporting the choice, which he had
made, and who was incapable of yielding either to the murmurs of the people or
the di&s;contents of the great. That artful prelate likewi&s;e, well 
<PB N="97" REF="102"> acquanted with the King's imperious temper, concealed
from him the ab&s;olute a&s;cendant, which he acquired; and while he &s;ecretly
directed all public councils, he ever pretended a blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the
will and authority of his ma&s;ter. By entering into the King's plea&s;ures, he
&s;till pre&s;erved his affections; by conducting his bu&s;ine&s;s, he
gratified his indolence; and by his unlimited complai&s;ance in both
capacities, he prevented all that jealou&s;y, to which his exorbitant
acqui&s;i|tions, and his &s;plendid, o&s;tentatious train of life &s;hould
naturally have given birth. The archbi&s;hoprick of York falling vacant by the
death of Bambrige, Wol&s;ey was promoted to that &s;ee, and re&s;igned the
bi&s;hoprick of Lincoln. Be&s;ides en|joying the admini&s;tration of Tournay,
he got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, at very low lea&s;es, of the revenues of Bath,
Worce&s;ter, and Hereford, bi&s;hopricks filled by Italians, who were allowed
to re&s;ide abroad, and who were glad to compound for this in|dulgence, by
parting with a con&s;iderable &s;hare of their profits. He held in com|mendam
the abbey of St. Albans, and many other church preferments. He was even allowed
to unite with the &s;ee of York, fir&s;t that of Durham, next that of
Winche&s;ter; and there &s;eemed to be no end of his acqui&s;itions. His
advance|ment in eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignity &s;erved him as a pretence for
engro&s;&s;ing &s;till more revenues: The pope, ob&s;erving his great influence
over the King, was de&s;irous of engaging him in his intere&s;t, and had
created him a cardinal. Never church|man, under colour of exacting regard to
religion, carried to a more exorbitant height, the &s;tate and dignity of that
character. His train con&s;i&s;ted of eight hun|dred &s;ervants, of whom many
were knights and gentlemen: Some even of the nobility put their children into
his family as a place of education; and in order to ingratiate them with their
patron, allowed them to bear offices as his &s;ervants. Whoever was
di&s;tingui&s;hed by any art or &s;cience payed court to the cardinal; and none
payed court in vain. Literature, which was then in its infancy, found in him a
generous patron; and both by his public in&s;titutions and private bounty, he
gave encouragement to every branch of erudition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Era&s;m. Epi&s;t lib. 2. Epi&s;t. 1. lib. 16. Epi&s;t. 3.</NOTE>.
Not content with this munificence, which gained him the approbation of the
wi&s;e, he &s;trove to dazzle the eyes of the populace, by the &s;plendour of
his equipage and furniture, the co&s;tly embroidery of his liveries, the
lu&s;tre of his apparel. He was the fir&s;t cler|gyman in England who wore
&s;ilk and gold, not only on his habit, but al&s;o on his &s;addles and the
trappings of his hor&s;es<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib.
27. Stowe, p. 501. Hollig&s;hed, p. 847.</NOTE>. He cau&s;ed his cardinal's hat
to be borne aloft by a per&s;on of rank; and when he came to the King's chapel,
would permit it to be laid on no place but the altar. A prie&s;t, the talle&s;t
and mo&s;t comely <PB N="98" REF="103"> he could find, carried before him a
pillar of &s;ilver, on who&s;e top was placed a cro&s;s: But not content with
this parade, to which he thought him&s;elf intitled as cardinal, he provided
another prie&s;t of equal &s;tature and beauty, who marched along, bearing the
cro&s;s of York, even in the dioce&s;e of Canterbury; contrary to the antient
rule and agreement between the prelates of the&s;e rival &s;ees.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>. The people made merry with the
cardinal's o&s;tentation; and &s;aid they were now &s;en|&s;ible, that one
cro&s;s alone was not &s;ufficient for the expiation of his &s;ins and
offences.</P>
<P>WARHAM, chancellor and archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, a man of a
very mode|rate temper, aver&s;e to all di&s;pute, cho&s;e rather to retire from
public employment, than maintain an unequal conte&s;t with the haughty
cardinal. He re&s;igned his office of chancellor; and the &s;eals were
immediately intru&s;ted to Wol&s;ey. If this new accumulation of dignity
encrea&s;ed his enemies, it al&s;o &s;erved to exalt his per|&s;onal character,
and prove the extent of his capacity. A &s;trict admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice
took place during his enjoyment of this high office; and no chancellor ever
di&s;covered greater impartiality in his deci&s;ions, deeper penetration of
judg|ment, or more enlarged knowledge of law and equity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir Thomas More. Stowe, p. 504.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Norfolk, finding the King's money almo&s;t all
exhau&s;ted by projects and plea&s;ures, while his inclination for expence
&s;till continued, was glad to re&s;ign his office of trea&s;urer, and retire
from court. His rival, Fox, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, profited not by his
ab&s;ence; but partly overcome by years and infir|mities, partly di&s;gu&s;ted
at the a&s;cendant acquired by Wol&s;ey, withdrew him&s;elf entirely to the
care of his dioce&s;e. The duke of Suffolk had al&s;o taken offence, that the
King, by the cardinal's per&s;wa&s;ion, had refu&s;ed to pay a debt, which he
had contracted during his abode in France; and he thenceforth affected to live
in privacy. The&s;e incidents left Wol&s;ey to enjoy without a rival the whole
power and favour of the King; and put into his hands every &s;pecies of
authority. In vain, did Fox, before his retirement, warn the King 
<Q REND="inline">"not to &s;uffer the &s;ervant to be greater

&s;overeign. Albany, though fir&s;t prince of the blood, had never been in
Scotland, was totally unacquainted with the manners of the people, ignorant of
their &s;ituation, unprac|ticed in their language; yet &s;uch was the favour
attending the French alliance, and &s;o great the authority of Hume, that this
prince was invited to accept the reins of government. Francis, careful not to
give offence to the King of England, detained Albany &s;ome time in France; but
at la&s;t, &s;en&s;ible how im|portant it was to keep Scotland in his
intere&s;ts, he permitted him to go over, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
regency: He even renewed the antient league with that kingdom, tho' it implied
&s;uch a clo&s;e connexion, as might be thought &s;omewhat to infringe his
alliance with England.</P>
<P>WHEN the regent arrived in Scotland, he made enquiries
concerning the &s;tate of the country, and character of the people; and
di&s;covered a &s;cene, with which he was hitherto but little acquainted. That
turbulent kingdom, he found, was rather to be con&s;idered as a confederacy,
and that not a clo&s;e one, of petty princes, than a regular &s;y&s;tem of
civil polity; and even the King, much more the regent, po&s;&s;e&s;t an
authority very uncertain and precarious. Arms, more than laws, prevailed; and
courage, pre&s;erably to equity or ju&s;tice, was the virtue mo&s;t valued and
re&s;pected. The nobility, in whom the whole power re&s;ided, were &s;o
connected by hereditary alliances, or &s;o divided by inveterate enmiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s, that it was impo&s;&s;ible, without
employing force, either to puni&s;h the mo&s;t

the mo&s;t entire innocence. Rapine and violence, when <PB N="100" REF="105">

recommended him to e&s;teem and approbation, and by rendering him u&s;eful to
the chieftain, entitled him to a preference above his fellows. And tho' the
nece&s;&s;ity of mutual &s;upport &s;erved as a clo&s;e cement of friend&s;hip
among tho&s;e of the &s;ame kindred, the &s;pirit of revenge again&s;t enemies,
and the de&s;ire of pro&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|cuting
the deadly feuds, (&s;o they were called) &s;till appeared to be pa&s;&s;ions
the mo&s;t predominant among that uncultivated people.</P>
<P>THE per&s;ons, to whom Albany fir&s;t applied for information
with regard to the &s;tate of the country, happened to be inveterate enemies of
Hume<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14. Drummond.</NOTE>; and they
repre&s;ented that powerful nobleman as the chief &s;ource of public
di&s;orders, and the great ob&s;tacle to the execution of the laws, and
admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. Before the authority of the magi&s;trate could
be e&s;tabli&s;hed, it was nece&s;&s;ary, they &s;aid, to make an example of
this great offender; and by the terror of his puni&s;h|ment, teach all
le&s;&s;er criminals to pay re&s;pect to the power of their &s;overeign.
Albany, moved by the&s;e rea&s;ons, was induced to forget Hume's pa&s;t
&s;ervices, to which he had been, in a great mea&s;ure, beholden for the
regency; and he no longer bore towards him that favourable countenance, with
which he was wont to receive him. Hume perceived the change, and was incited,
both by views of his own &s;ecurity and his revenge, to take mea&s;ures in
oppo&s;ition to the regent. He applied him&s;elf to Angus and the queen
dowager, and repre&s;ented to them the danger to which the infant prince was
expo&s;ed, from the ambition of Albany, the next heir to the crown, to whom the
&s;tates had imprudently entru&s;ted the whole authority of government. By his
per&s;wa&s;ion, &s;he formed the de&s;ign of carrying off the young King, and
putting him under the protection of her bro|ther; and when that con&s;piracy
was di&s;covered, &s;he her&s;elf, accompanied with Hume and Angus, withdrew
into England, where &s;he was &s;oon after delivered of a daughter.</P>
<P>HENRY, in order to check the authority of Albany and the French
party, gave encouragement to the&s;e malecontents, and a&s;&s;ured them of his
protection. Matters being afterwards in appearance accommodated between Hume
and the regent, that nobleman returned into his own country; but mutual
&s;u&s;picions and jealou&s;ies &s;till prevailed. He was committed to
cu&s;tody, under the care of the earl of Arran, his brother-in-law; and was,
for &s;ome time, detained pri&s;oner in his ca&s;tle. But having per&s;waded
Arran to enter into the con&s;piracy with him, he was allowed to make his
e&s;cape; and he openly made war upon the regent. A new accommodation en&s;ued,
no more &s;incere than the foregoing; and Hume was &s;o imprudent as to put
him&s;elf, together with his brother, into the hands of <PB N="101" REF="106">
the regent. They were immediately &s;eized, committed to cu&s;tody, brought to
their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">al, condemned, and executed.
No legal crime was proved again&s;t the&s;e brothers: It was only alleged,
that, at the battle of Flouden, they had not done their duty in &s;upporting
the King; and as this backwardne&s;s could not, from the whole cour&s;e of
their pa&s;t life, be a&s;cribed to cowardice, it was com|monly imputed to a
more criminal motive. The evidences, however, of guilt produced again&s;t them,
were far from being valid or convincing; and the people, who hated them while
alive, were very much di&s;&s;atisfied with their execution.</P>
<P>SUCH violent remedies often produce, for &s;ome time, a
deceitful tranquillity; but as they de&s;troy mutual confidence, and beget the
mo&s;t inveterate animo&s;ities, their con&s;equences are commonly very &s;atal
both to the public, and to tho&s;e who make trial of them. The regent, however,
took advantage of the pre&s;ent calm which prevailed; and being invited by the
French king, who was, at that time, willing to gratify Henry, he went over into
France; and was detained there during five years. A great part of his authority
he entru&s;ted into the hands of Darcy, a Frenchman, whom he created warden of
the marches, and who was extremely vigilant in the di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice,
and the puni&s;hment of crimes and oppre&s;&s;ion. But Sir David Hume, a
kin&s;man of the nobleman lately executed, de&s;irous of revenging his friend's
death on the friend of the regent, way-laid Darcy near Dun&s;e; and after
reproaching him with that execution, made an attack upon him. Darcy finding
him&s;elf too weak to re&s;i&s;t, and tru&s;ting to the &s;wiftne&s;s of his
hor&s;e, fled towards Dunbar; but being ignorant of the roads, he ran into a
bog, was overtaken by the pur&s;uers, and put to death. As he wore long flowing
hair, Hume, exulting in this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination as a gallant exploit, cut
out the&s;e locks, and pleating them into a wreath, wore them ever after at the
pummel of his &s;addle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14.

<P>AFTER this great victory, the conque&s;t of the Milaneze was
ea&s;y and open. Francis, &s;en&s;ible how important the alliance of the
cantons was, even in their lowe&s;t fortune, gave them all the conditions,
which they could have demanded, had they been ever &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful; and he
courted their friend&s;hip by every po&s;|&s;ible conde&s;cen&s;ion. The
Venetians were in alliance with France; and as they tru&s;ted entirely to the

&s;ole fault was too great fine&s;&s;e and artifice, a fault, which, both as a

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jealou&s;y of Henry.</NOTE> THE &s;ucce&s;s

rapid progre&s;s, tho' in &s;o di&s;tant a country, was not regarded without
apprehen&s;ions by the Engli&s;h mini&s;try. Italy was during that age the
&s;eat of religion, of literature, and of commerce; and as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
alone that lu&s;tre, which has &s;ince been &s;hared among other nations, it
fixed the attention of all Europe, and every acqui&s;ition which was made
there, appeared more impor|tant than its weight in the ballance of power
&s;hould, &s;trictly &s;peaking, have de|manded. Henry al&s;o thought, that he

Te|ro&uuml;enne was al&s;o regarded as a breach of treaty. But above all, what
tended to alienate the court of England, was the di&s;gu&s;t which Wol&s;ey had
taken again&s;t the French monarch.</P>
<P>HENRY, on the conque&s;t of Tournay, had refu&s;ed to admit
Lewis Gaillart, the bi&s;hop elect, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
temporalities, becau&s;e that prelate de|clined taking the oath of allegiance
to his new &s;overeign; and Wol&s;ey was appointed, in his room,
admini&s;trator of the bi&s;hoprick. As the cardinal wi&s;hed to obtain free
and undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he applied to Francis, and de&s;ired him
to be&s;tow on Gaillart &s;ome &s;ee of equal value in France, and to obtain
his re&s;ignation of Tournay. Francis, who &s;till hoped to recover
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that city, and who feared that the full &s;ettlement of
Wol&s;ey in the bi&s;hopric would prove an ob&s;tacle to his purpo&s;e, had
hitherto neglected to gratify the haughty prelate; and the bi&s;hop of Tournay,
by applying to the court of Rome, had obtained a bull for his &s;ettlement in
that &s;ee. Wol&s;ey, who expected to be com|plied with in every reque&s;t, and
who exacted re&s;pect even from the greate&s;t monarchs, re&s;ented the
&s;light put upon him by Francis; and he pu&s;hed his ma&s;ter to &s;eek an

<P>MAXIMILIAN the emperor was ready to embrace every propo&s;al of
a new en|terprize, e&s;pecially if attended with an offer of money, of which he
was ex|tremely greedy, extremely prodigal, and extremely nece&s;&s;itous.
Richard Pace, formerly &s;ecretary to cardinal Bambrige, now &s;ecretary of
&s;tate, was di&s;patched <PB N="104" REF="109">
<MILESTONE N="1516" UNIT="year"> to the court of Vienna, and had a
commi&s;&s;ion to propo&s;e &s;ome con&s;iderable payments to Maximilian<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria, epi&s;t. 568.</NOTE>: He thence made a journey
into Switzerland; and by like motives engaged &s;ome of the cantons to
furni&s;h troops to the emperor. That prince invaded Italy with a
con&s;iderable army; but being repul&s;ed from before Milan, he retreated with
his army into Germany, made peace with France and Venice, delivered Verona to
that republic for a &s;um of money, and thus excluded him&s;elf, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, from all future acce&s;s into Italy. And Henry found, that, after
expending five or &s;ix hundred thou&s;and ducats, in order to gratify the
cardinal's re&s;entment, he had only loo&s;ened his alliance with Francis,
without dimini&s;hing the power of that prince.</P>
<P>THERE were many rea&s;ons, which engaged the King not to proceed
farther at pre&s;ent in his enmity again&s;t France. He could hope for
a&s;&s;i&s;tance from no power in Europe. Ferdinand, his father in law, who had
often deceived him, was now declining fa&s;t from age and infirmities; and a
&s;peedy end was looked for to the long and pro&s;perous reign of that great
monarch. Charles, prince of Spain, &s;overeign of the Low Countries, de&s;ired
nothing but peace with Francis, who had it &s;o much in his power, if provoked,
to ob&s;truct his peaceable acce&s;&s;ion to that rich inheritance, which was
waiting him. The pope was overawed by the power of France, and Venice was
engaged in a clo&s;e alliance with that mo|narchy<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 12.</NOTE>. Henry therefore remained in
tranquillity during &s;ome time; and &s;eemed to give him&s;elf no concern with
regard to the affairs of the continent. In vain did Maximilian endeavour to
allure him into &s;ome expence, by offering to make a re&s;ignation of the
imperial crown in his favour. That artifice was too gro&s;s to &s;ucceed even
with a prince &s;o little political as Henry; and Pace, his envoy, who was
perfectly well acquainted with the emperors motives and cha|racter, gave him
warning, that the &s;ole view of that prince in making him &s;o liberal an
offer, was to draw money from him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15th January.</NOTE> WHILE an univer&s;al
peace prevailed in Europe, that event happened, which had &s;o long been looked
for, and from which &s;uch important con&s;equences were expected, the death of
Ferdinand, the catholic, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his grand|&s;on, Charles,
to his exten&s;ive dominions. No commotion, however, or alte|ration followed
immediately upon that great incident. This young prince, who had not yet
reached his &s;ixteenth year, was already a great &s;tate&s;man, from the
excellent education which he had received, and from the mature and &s;olid
judgment, with which nature had endowed him. He was &s;en&s;ible how im|portant
it was to pre&s;erve peace with foreigners, till he &s;hould have
e&s;tabli&s;hed <PB N="105" REF="110"> his authority in his new dominions; and
finding Francis de&s;irous to take ad|vantage of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, he
made him an offer of &s;uch terms as gained the friend&s;hip and alliance of
that monarch. He engaged to marry Francis's daughter, tho' only an infant of a
year old; to receive as her dowry all her father's preten&s;ions on the kingdom
of Naples; to pay him a hundred thou&s;and crowns a year, till the
con&s;ummation of the marriage; and to give the King of Navarre &s;atisfaction
with regard to his dominions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Recueil de Trait&eacute;s

fini&s;hed this treaty at Noyon by his mini&s;ters, and having thus left every

&s;ucce&s;&s;ion lay in his mother, Joan, who was &s;till alive; but as &s;he
was u&s;ually di&s;|ordered in her judgment, Ferdinand had left the
admini&s;tration to his grand&s;on, Charles; and the &s;tates, both of
Ca&s;tile and Arragon, gave their con&s;ent to this de&s;tination.</P>
<P>THE more Charles advanced in power and authority, the more was
Francis &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity he lay under of gaining the

&s;ucceeded in his purpo&s;e, he took an opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing his

<P>WHEN matters &s;eemed &s;ufficiently prepared, Bonnivet opened
to the cardinal his ma&s;ter's de&s;ire of recovering Tournay; and Wol&s;ey
immediately, without he&s;itation, engaged to effectuate his purpo&s;e. He took
an opportunity of re|pre&s;enting <PB N="106" REF="111"> to the King and
council, that Tournay lay &s;o remote from Calais, that it would be very
difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, in ca&s;e of a war, to keep the communication
open between tho&s;e two places: That as it was &s;ituate on the frontiers both
of France and the Netherlands, it was expo&s;ed to the attacks of both the&s;e
powers, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, either by force or famine, fall into the
hands of the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ailant: That even in time of peace, it could not be
pre&s;erved without a large garri&s;on, to re&s;train the numerous and mutinous
inhabitants, ever di&s;contented with the Engli&s;h government: And that the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Tournay, as it was thus precarious and expen&s;ive, &s;o
was it entirely u&s;ele&s;s, and gave little or no acce&s;s to annoy, on
occa&s;ion, the dominions either of Charles or of Francis.</P>
<P>THESE rea&s;ons were of them&s;elves very convincing, and were
&s;ure of meeting with no oppo&s;ition, when they came from the mouth of the
cardinal. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tournay de|livered to France.</NOTE> A treaty
there|fore was entered into for the delivering up of Tournay; and in order to
give to that mea&s;ure a more graceful appearance, it was agreed, that the
Dauphin and the prince&s;s Mary, both of them infants, &s;hould be betrothed,
and that this city &s;hould be con&s;idered as the dowry of the prince&s;s.
Such kinds of agreement were then common among &s;overeigns, tho' it was very
rare, that the intere&s;ts and views of the parties continued &s;o &s;teady as
to render the intended marriages effectual. But as Henry had been at
con&s;iderable expence in building a citadel at Tournay, Francis agreed to pay
him 600,000 crowns at twelve yearly pay|ments, and to put into his hands eight
ho&s;tages, all of them men of quality, for the performance of the article<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires du Bellay, liv. 1.</NOTE>. And le&s;t the cardinal
&s;hould think him&s;elf neglected in the&s;e &s;tipulations, he promi&s;ed him
a yearly pen&s;ion of twelve thou|&s;and livres, as an equivalent for his
admini&s;tration of the bi&s;hopric of Tournay. He al&s;o engaged to recall
Albany from Scotland.</P>
<P>FRANCIS having &s;ucceeded &s;o well in this negotiation, began
to enlarge his views, and to hope for more con&s;iderable advantages, by
practi&s;ing on the vanity and &s;elf conceit of this haughty favourite. He
redoubled his flatteries to the cardinal, con&s;ulted him more frequently in
every doubt or difficulty, called him in each letter, <HI>father, tutor,

it; and if we may credit Polydore Virgil, who bears a particular &s;pite to
Wol&s;ey, on ac|count of his being di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his employment and
thrown into pri&s;on by that mini&s;ter, &s;o extravagant a propo&s;al met with

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wol&s;ey ap|pointed le|gate.</NOTE> THE
enormous pride of Wol&s;ey was now farther encrea&s;ed by a great acce&s;&s;ion
of dignity and power which he had received. Cardinal Campeggio had been &s;ent
as legate into England, in order to procure a tythe from the clergy, for
enabling the pope to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of the Turks; a danger which was
real, and was formidable to all chri&s;tendom, but which had been &s;o often
made u&s;e of to &s;erve the intere&s;ted purpo&s;es of the court of Rome, that
it had lo&s;t all influence on the minds of the people. The Clergy refu&s;ed to
comply with Leo's demand: Campeggio was recalled; and the King de&s;ired of the
pope, that Wol&s;ey, who had been joined in this commi&s;&s;ion, might alone be
inve&s;ted with the legantine power, together with the right of vi&s;it|ing all
the clergy and mona&s;teries, and even with &s;u&s;pending the whole laws of
the church during a twelve month. Wol&s;ey, having obtained this new dig|nity,
made a new di&s;play of that &s;tate and parade, to which he was &s;o much
addicted. On &s;olemn fea&s;t-days, he was not contented without &s;aying
ma&s;s after the manner of the pope him&s;elf: Not only he had bi&s;hops and
abbots to &s;erve him; he even engaged the fir&s;t nobility to give him water
and the towel. He affected a rank &s;uperior to what had ever been claimed by
any churchman in England. Warham, the primate, having wrote him a letter, where
he &s;ub|&s;cribed him&s;elf, <HI>your loving brother,</HI> Wol&s;ey complained
of his pre&s;umption, in thus challenging an equality with him. When Warham was
told what offence he had given, he made light of the matter. 
<Q REND="inline">"Know ye not," he &s;aid, "that this man is

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His manner of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> that office.</NOTE> BUT
Wol&s;ey carried the matter much farther than vain pomp and o&s;tentation. He
erected an office, which he called the legantine court; and as he was now, by
means of the pope's commi&s;&s;ion and the King's favour, inve&s;ted with all
power, both eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil, no man knew what bounds were to be
&s;et to the authority of this new tribunal. He conferred on it a &s;pecies of
inqui&s;itorial and cen&s;orial powers even over the laiety, and directed it to
examine into all matters of con&s;cience; into all conduct which had given
&s;candal; into all actions, which, though they e&s;caped the law, might appear
contrary to good morals. Offence was ju&s;tly taken at this commi&s;&s;ion,
which was really unbounded; and <PB N="108" REF="113"> the people were the more
di&s;g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ted, when they &s;aw a man,

licences of plea&s;ure, &s;o &s;evere in repre&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t appearance
of immo|rality in others. But to render his court more obnoxious, Wol&s;ey made
one John Allen the judge in it, a per&s;on of &s;candalous life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memorials, vol. 1. p. 125.</NOTE>, whom he him&s;elf, as
chancellor, had condemned for perjury: And as this man either exacted fines
from every one whom he was plea&s;ed to find guilty, or took bribes to drop
pro|&s;ecutions, men concluded, and with &s;ome appearance of rea&s;on, that he
&s;hared with the cardinal the&s;e wages of iniquity. The clergy, and in
particular the monks, were expo&s;ed to this tyranny; and as the libertini&s;m
of their lives often gave a ju&s;t handle again&s;t them, they were obliged to
buy an indemnity, by paying large &s;ums of money to the legate or his judge.
Not contented with this authority, Wol&s;ey pretended, by virtue of his
commi&s;&s;ion, to a&s;&s;ume the power of all the bi&s;hops courts;
particularly that of judging of Wills and Te&s;taments; and his deci&s;ions in
the&s;e important points were e&s;teemed not a little arbitrary. As if he
him&s;elf were pope, and as if the pope could di&s;po&s;e ab&s;olutely of every
eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment, he pre&s;ented to whatever priories or
benefices he plea&s;ed, without regard to the right of election in the monks,

<P>NO one dur&s;t carry to the King any complaint again&s;t the&s;e

<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th of Janu|ary.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the emperor Max|imilian.</NOTE>
Maximilian the emperor died, a man, who, of him&s;elf, was indeed of little
con&s;equence; but as his death left vacant the fir&s;t &s;tation among
chri&s;tian princes, it put all men's &s;pirits into agitation, and proved a
kind of aera in the general &s;y&s;tem of Europe. The Kings of France and Spain
immediately declared them&s;elves candidates for the imperial throne; and
employed every expedient of money or intrigue, which promi&s;ed them
&s;ucce&s;s in &s;o great a point of ambition. Henry al&s;o was encouraged to
put in his preten|&s;ions; but his mini&s;ter, Pace, who was di&s;patched to
the electors, found that he began to &s;ollicit too late, and that the votes of
all the&s;e princes were already pre engaged either on the one &s;ide or the
other.</P>
<P>FRANCIS and Charles made profe&s;&s;ion from the beginning of
carrying on this rival&s;hip with emulation, but without enmity; and Francis in
particular de|clared, that his brother Charles and he were, fairly and openly,
&s;uitors to the &s;ame mi&s;tre&s;s: The more fortunate, added he, will carry
her; and the other mu&s;t re&s;t contented<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belcario,

extreme moderation, however rea&s;onable, would not be of long duration; and
that incidents would certainly occur to &s;harpen the minds of the candidates
again&s;t each other. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charles, King of Spain, cho&s;en
empe|ror.</NOTE> It was Charles who at la&s;t prevailed, to the great
di&s;appointment of the French monarch, who &s;till continued in the belief,
that the majority of the electoral college was engaged in his favour. And as he
was &s;ome years &s;uperior in age to his rival, and, after his victory at
Marignan, and conque&s;t of the Milane&s;e, much &s;uperior in renown, he could
not &s;uppre&s;s his indignation, at being thus, in the face of all mankind,
after long and anxious expectation, po&s;t-poned in &s;o important a
pre|ten&s;ion. From this concurrence, as much as from oppo&s;ition of
intere&s;t, aro&s;e that emulation between tho&s;e two great monarchs, which,
while it kept their whole age in agitation, &s;ets them in &s;o remarkable a
contra&s;t to each other: Both of them princes endowed with talents and
abilities; brave, a&s;piring, active, indu&s;trious; beloved by their
&s;ervants and &s;ubjects, dreaded by their enemies, and re&s;pected by all the
world: Francis, open, frank, liberal, munificent, car|rying the&s;e virtues to
an exce&s;s which prejudiced his affairs: Charles, political, clo&s;e,
artificial, frugal; better calculated to obtain &s;ucce&s;s in wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s and in nego|tiations, e&s;pecially
the latter. The one, the more amiable man; the other, the greater monarch. The
King, from his over&s;ights and indi&s;cretions, naturally expo&s;ed to
misfortunes; but qualified, by his &s;pirit and magnanimity, to extri|cate
him&s;elf from them with honour: The emperor, by his de&s;igning, intere&s;ted 
<PB N="110" REF="115"> character, fitted, in his greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es to
excite jealou&s;y and oppo&s;ition even among his allies, and to rouze up a
multitude of enemies, in the place of one whom he had &s;ubdued. And as the
per&s;onal qualities of the&s;e princes thus counterpoi&s;ed each other, &s;o
did the advantages and di&s;advantages of their dominions. Fortune alone,
without the concurrence of prudence or valour, never reared up of a &s;udden
&s;o great a power as that which centered in the emperor Charles. He reaped the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Ca&s;tile, of Arragon, of Au&s;tria, of Burgundy: He
inherited the conque&s;t of Naples, of Granada: Election entitled him to the
empire: Even the bounds of the globe &s;eemed to be enlarged a little before
his time, that he might po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole trea&s;ures, as yet entire and
unrifled, of the new world. But tho' the concur|rence of all the&s;e advantages
formed an empire greater and more exten&s;ive than any known in Europe &s;ince
that of the Romans, the kingdom of France alone, being clo&s;e, compact,
united, rich, populous, and being interpo&s;ed between all the provinces of
Charles's dominions, was able to make a vigorous oppo&s;ition to his
progre&s;s, and maintain the conte&s;t again&s;t him.</P>
<P>HENRY po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that felicity, of being able, both by
the native force of his kingdom and its &s;ituation, to hold the ballance
between tho&s;e two powers; and had he known to improve, by policy and
prudence, this &s;ingular and ine&s;timable advantage, he was really, by means
of it, a greater prince than either of tho&s;e mighty monarchs, who &s;eemed to
&s;trive for the dominion of Europe. But the character of this King was
heedle&s;s, incon&s;iderate, capricious, impolitic; guided by his pa&s;&s;ion
or his favourite; vain, imperious, haughty; &s;ometimes actuated by
friend&s;hip for foreign powers, oftener by re&s;entment, &s;eldom by his true
in|tere&s;t. And thus, tho' he triumphed in that &s;uperiority which his
&s;ituation in Europe gave him, he never employed it to the e&s;&s;ential and

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Interview be|tween Henry and Francis at

endeavoured to ac|commodate his conduct to it. He &s;ollicited an interview
near Calais; in expec|tation of being able, by familiar conver&s;ation, to gain
upon his friend&s;hip and confidence. Wol&s;ey earne&s;tly &s;econded this

riches, his &s;plendour, and his influence over both monarchs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>. And as Henry him&s;elf loved

<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of May.</NOTE> WHILE Henry was preparing
to depart for Calais, he was &s;urprized to hear that the emperor was arrived
at Dover; and he immediately ha&s;tened thither with the queen, in order to
give a &s;uitable reception to his royal gue&s;t. That great prince, politic
tho' young, having heard of the intended interview between Francis and Henry,
was apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;equences, and was re&s;olved to take the
opportunity, in his pa&s;&s;age from Spain to the Low Countries, to make the
King &s;till a higher compliment, by paying him a vi&s;it in his own dominions.
Be&s;ides the marks of regard and attachment which he gave to Henry, he
&s;trove, by every te&s;timony of friend&s;hip, by flatteries, prote&s;tations,
promi&s;es and pre&s;ents, to gain on the vanity, the avarice, and the ambition
of the cardinal. He here in|&s;tilled into this a&s;piring prelate the hope of
attaining the papacy; and as that was the &s;ole point of elevation, beyond his
pre&s;ent greatne&s;s, it was &s;ure to attract his wi&s;hes with the &s;ame
ardour, as if fortune had never, as yet, favoured him with any of her
pre&s;ents. In hopes of reaching this dignity by the emperor's
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he &s;ecretly devoted him&s;elf to that monarch's
intere&s;ts; and Charles was perhaps the more liberal of his promi&s;es, that
Leo was a very young man; and it was not likely, that, for many years, he would
be called upon to fulfil his engagements. Henry ea&s;ily ob&s;erved this
court&s;hip payed to his mini&s;ter; but in&s;tead of taking umbrage at it, he
only made it a &s;ubject of vanity; and believed, that, as Wol|&s;ey's &s;ole
&s;upport was his favour, the obei&s;ance of &s;uch mighty monarchs to his
&s;ervant, was in reality a more con&s;picuous homage to his own grandeur.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of May.</NOTE> THE day of Charles's
departure, Henry went over to Calais with the queen and his whole court; and
from thence proceeded to Gui&s;nes, a &s;mall town near the frontiers. Francis,
attended in like manner, came to Andres, a few miles di&s;tant; and the two
monarchs met, for the fir&s;t time, in the fields, at a place &s;ituate between
the&s;e two towns, but &s;till within the Engli&s;h pale: For Francis agreed to
pay that compliment to Henry, in con&s;ideration of that prince's pa&s;&s;ing
the &s;ea, that he might be pre&s;ent at the interview. Wol&s;ey, to whom both
Kings had entru&s;ted the regulation of the ceremonial, contrived this
circum&s;tance, in order to do honour to his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="117"> THE two monarchs, after &s;aluting each
other in the mo&s;t cordial manner, retired into a sent which had been erected
on purpo&s;e, and they held a &s;ecret con|ference together. Henry here
propo&s;ed to make &s;ome amendments on the arti|cles of their former alliance;
and he began to read the treaty, <HI>I Henry King:</HI> The&s;e were the
fir&s;t words; and he &s;topt a moment. He &s;ubjoined only the words, <HI>of
England,</HI> without adding, <HI>France,</HI> the u&s;ual of the Engli&s;h
mo|narchs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Fleuranges.</NOTE>. Francis
remarked this delicacy, and expre&s;&s;ed by a &s;mile his approba|tion of
it.</P>
<P>HE took an opportunity &s;oon after of paying a compliment to
Henry of a more e&s;&s;ential nature. That generous prince, full of honour
him&s;elf, and inca|pable of di&s;tru&s;ting others, was &s;hocked at all the
precautions which were ob|&s;erved, whenever he had an interview with the
Engli&s;h monarch: The number of their guards and attendants was carefully
counted on both &s;ides: Every &s;tep was &s;crupulou&s;ly mea&s;ured and
adju&s;ted: And if the two Kings propo&s;ed to pay a vi&s;it to the queens,
they departed from their &s;everal quarters at the &s;ame in&s;tant, which was
marked by the firing of a culverin; they pa&s;&s;ed each other in the mid|dle
point between the places; and at the &s;ame in&s;tant that Henry entered
Ardres, Francis put him&s;elf into the hands of the Engli&s;h at Gui&s;nes. In
order to break off this tedious ceremony, which contained &s;o many
di&s;honourable implications, Francis, one day, took with him two gentlemen and
a page, and rode directly into Gui&s;nes. The guards were &s;urprized at the
pre&s;ence of the monarch, who called aloud to them, <HI>You are all my
pri&s;oners: Carry me to your ma&s;ter.</HI> Henry was equally a&s;toni&s;hed
at the appearance of Francis; and taking him in his arms, 
<Q REND="inline">"My brother," &s;aid he, "you have here played
me the mo&s;t agreeable trick in the world, and have &s;howed me the full
confidence I may place in you: I &s;ur|render my&s;elf your pri&s;oner from

angels<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">An angel was then e&s;timated at &s;even
&s;hillings, or near twelve of our pre&s;ent money.</NOTE>; and putting it
about Francis's, begged him to wear it, for the &s;ake of his pri&s;oner.
Francis agreed, but on condition that Henry &s;hould wear a bracelet, of which
he made him a pre&s;ent, and which was double in value to the collar<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Fleuranges.</NOTE>. The King went next
day to Ardres, with|out guards or attendants; and confidence being now fully
e&s;tabli&s;hed between the monarchs, they employed the re&s;t of the time
entirely in tournaments and fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P>A DEFIANCE had been &s;ent by the two Kings to each others
court, and thro' all the chief cities of Europe, importing, that Henry and
Francis, with fourteen aids, would be ready, in the plains of Picardy, to
an&s;wer all comers, that were <PB N="113" REF="118"> gentlemen, at tilt,
tourney, and barriers. The monarchs, in order to fulfil this challenge,
advanced into the field on hor&s;eback, Francis &s;urrounded with Henry's
guards, and Henry with tho&s;e of Francis. They were gorgiou&s;ly apparelled;
and were both of them the mo&s;t comely per&s;onages of the age, as well as the
mo&s;t expert in every military exerci&s;e. They carried away the prize at all
trials in tho&s;e rough and dangerous pa&s;times; and &s;everal hor&s;es and
riders were over|thrown by their vigour and dexterity. The ladies were the
judges in the&s;e &s;eats of chivalry, and put an end to the rencounter
whenever they judged it expedient. Henry erected a &s;pacious hou&s;e of wood
and canvas, which had been framed in London; and he here fea&s;ted the French
monarch. He had placed a motto on this fabric, under the figure of an Engli&s;h
archer embroidered on it, <HI>Cui adhaereo praee&s;t. He prevails whom I

<P>HENRY, after his return to Calais, paid a vi&s;it to the emperor
and Margaret of Savoy at Gravelines, and engaged them to go along with him to
Calais, and pa&s;s &s;ome days in that fortre&s;s. The artful and politic
Charles here compleated the impre&s;&s;ion, which he had begun to make on Henry
and his favourite, and effaced all the friend&s;hip, to which the frank and
liberal nature of Francis had given birth. As the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria began
&s;en&s;ibly to take the a&s;cendant over the French monarchy, the intere&s;ts
of England required that &s;ome &s;upport &s;hould be given to the latter, and
above all, that any important wars &s;hould be prevented, which might be&s;tow
on either of them a deci&s;ive &s;uperiority over the other. But the jealou&s;y
of the Engli&s;h again&s;t France has ever prevented a cordial union between
the&s;e nations: And Charles, &s;en&s;ible of this hereditary animo&s;ity, and
de&s;irous farther to flatter Henry's vanity, had made him an offer, (an offer
in which Francis was afterwards obliged to concur) that he &s;hould be entire
arbiter in any di&s;pute or difference that &s;hould ari&s;e between the
monarchs. But the great ma&s;terpiece of Charles's politics was the &s;ecuring
Wol&s;ey in his intere&s;ts, by very important &s;ervices, and &s;till higher
promi&s;es. He renewed a&s;&s;urances of a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in obtaining the
papacy; and he put him in pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the revenues,
belonging to the &s;ees of Badajox and Palencia in Ca&s;tile. The
acqui|&s;itions of Wol&s;ey were now become &s;o exorbitant, that, joined to
the pen&s;ions from foreign powers, which Henry allowed him to po&s;&s;e&s;s,
his revenues were computed nearly to equal tho&s;e which belonged to the crown
it&s;elf; and he &s;pent <PB N="114" REF="119"> them with a magnificence, or

demands in the conference were &s;o unrea&s;onable, as plainly proved him
con&s;cious of this advantage. He required the re&s;titution

before by treaty, and which would have given him acce&s;s into the mid&s;t of

Noyon, pro|mi&s;ed to renew. On Francis's rejecting the&s;e terms, the

</ARGUMENT>
<P>DURING &s;ome years, many parts of Europe had been agitated with
tho&s;e religious controver&s;ies, which produced the reformation, one of the
greate&s;t events in hi&s;tory: But as it was not till this time, that the King
of England pub|lickly took part in the quarrel, we had no occa&s;ion to give
any account of its ri&s;e and progre&s;s. It will now be nece&s;&s;ary to
explain the&s;e theological di&s;putes; or what is more material, to trace from
their origin tho&s;e abu&s;es, which &s;o ge|nerally diffu&s;ed the opinion,
that a reformation of the church or eccle&s;ia&s;tical order was become highly
expedient, if not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. We &s;hall be better enabled to
comprehend the &s;ubject, if we take the matter a little higher, and reflect a
moment on the rea&s;ons, why there mu&s;t be an eccle&s;ia&s;tical order, and a
public e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion in every civilized community. The
im|portance of the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion will, I hope, excu&s;e this &s;hort
digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Digre&s;&s;ion concerning the
eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal &s;tate.</NOTE> MOST of the arts and profe&s;&s;ions in a
&s;tate are of &s;uch a nature, that, while they promote the intere&s;ts of the
&s;ociety, they are al&s;o u&s;eful or agreeable to &s;ome individuals; and in
that ca&s;e, the con&s;tant rule of the magi&s;trate, except, per|haps, on the
fir&s;t introduction of any art, is, to leave the profe&s;&s;ion to it&s;elf,
and tru&s;t its encouragement to the individuals, who reap the benefit of it.
The arti|zans, finding their profits to ri&s;e by the favour of their
cu&s;tomers, encrea&s;e, as <PB N="117" REF="122"> much as po&s;&s;ible, their
&s;kill and indu&s;try; and as matters are not di&s;turbed by any injudicious
tampering, the commodity is always &s;ure to be at all times ex|actly
proportioned to the demand.</P>
<P>BUT there are al&s;o &s;ome callings, which, tho' u&s;eful and
even nece&s;&s;ary in a &s;tate, bring no advantage nor plea&s;ure to any
individuals; and the &s;upreme power is obliged to alter its conduct with
regard to the retainers of tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions. It mu&s;t give them public
encouragement in order to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance; and it mu&s;t provide
again&s;t that negligence, to which they will naturally be &s;ubject, either by
annexing particular honour to the profe&s;&s;ion, by e&s;tabli&s;hing a long
&s;ubordination of ranks and a &s;trict dependance, or by &s;ome other
expedient. The per&s;ons employed in the finances, armies, fleets, and
magi&s;tracy are in|&s;tances of this order of men.</P>
<P>IT may naturally be thought, at fir&s;t view, that the
eccle&s;ia&s;tics belong to the fir&s;t cla&s;s, and that their encouragement,
as well as that of lawyers and phy&s;i|cians, may &s;afely be tru&s;ted to the
liberality of individuals, who are attached to their doctrines, and who find
benefit or con&s;olation from their &s;piritual mini&s;try and
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Their indu&s;try and vigilance will, no doubt, be whetted by
&s;uch an additional motive; and their &s;kill in the profe&s;&s;ion, as well
as their addre&s;s in governing the minds of the people, mu&s;t receive daily
encrea&s;e, from their encrea&s;ing practice, &s;tudy, and attention.</P>
<P>BUT if we con&s;ider the matter more clo&s;ely, we &s;hall find,
that this intere&s;ted diligence of the clergy is what every wi&s;e
legi&s;lator will &s;tudy to avoid; becau&s;e in every religion, except the
true, it is highly pernicious, and has even a natural tendency to pervert the
true, by infu&s;ing into it a &s;trong mixture of &s;uper&s;tition, folly, and
delu&s;ion. Each gho&s;tly practitioner, in order to render him&s;elf more
precious and &s;acred in the eyes of his retainers, mu&s;t in&s;pire them with
the mo&s;t violent abhorrence again&s;t all other &s;ects, and continually
endeavour, by &s;ome novelty, to excite the languid devotion of his audience.
No regard will be paid to truth, morals, or decency in the doctrines
inculcated. Every tenet will be adopted, that be&s;t &s;uits the di&s;orderly
affections of the human frame. Cu&s;tomers will be drawn to each conventicle by
new indu&s;try and addre&s;s in practi&s;ing on the pa&s;&s;ions and credulity
of the populace. And in the end, the civil magi&s;trate will find, that he has
paid dearly for his pretended frugality, in &s;aving a &s;ettled foundation for
the prie&s;ts; and that in reality the mo&s;t decent and advantageous
compo&s;ition, which he can make with the &s;piritual guides, is to bribe their
in|dolence, by affixing &s;tated &s;allaries to their profe&s;&s;ion, and
rendering it &s;uper|fluous for them to be farther active, than merely to
pre&s;erve their flock from &s;traying in que&s;t of new pa&s;tures. And in
this manner eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, <PB N="118" REF="123"> tho'
commonly they aro&s;e at fir&s;t from religious views, prove in the end
advantageous to the political intere&s;ts of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BUT we may ob&s;erve, that few eccle&s;ia&s;tical
establi&s;hments have been fixed upon a wor&s;e foundation than that of the
church of Rome, or have been at|tended with circum&s;tances more hurtful to the
peace and happine&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P>THE large revenues, privileges, immunities, and powers of the
clergy ren|dered them formidable to the civil magi&s;trate, and armed with too
exten&s;ive authority an order of men, who always adhere clo&s;ely together,
and who never want a plau&s;ible pretence for their encroachments and
u&s;urpations. The higher dignities of the church &s;erved, indeed, to the
&s;upport of gentry and nobility; but by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of
mona&s;teries, many of the lowe&s;t vulgar were taken from the u&s;eful arts,
and maintained in tho&s;e receptacles of &s;loth and ignorance. The &s;upreme
head of the church was a foreign potentate, who was guided by intere&s;ts,
always different, &s;ometimes contrary to tho&s;e of the community. And as the
hierarchy was nece&s;&s;arily &s;olicitous to pre&s;erve an unity of faith,
rites and ceremonies, all liberty of thought ran a manife&s;t ri&s;que of being
extingui&s;hed; and violent per&s;ecutions, or what was wor&s;e, a &s;tupid and
abject credulity, took place every where.</P>
<P>TO encrea&s;e the&s;e evils, the church, tho' &s;he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed large revenues, was not contented with her acqui&s;itions,
but retained a power of practi&s;ing farther on the ignorance of mankind. She
even be&s;towed on each individual prie&s;t a power of enriching him&s;elf by
the voluntary oblations of the faithful, and left him &s;till a powerful motive
for diligence and indu&s;try in his calling. And thus, that church, tho' an
expen&s;ive and burthen&s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hment, was liable to many of the
inconveniencies, which belong to an order of prie&s;ts, tru&s;ted entirely to
their own art and invention for attaining a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>THE advantages, attending the Romi&s;h hierarchy, were but a
&s;mall compen|&s;ation for its inconveniencies. The eccle&s;ia&s;tical
privileges, during barbarous times, had &s;erved as a cheque to the
de&s;poti&s;m of Kings. The union of all the we&s;tern churches under the
&s;upreme pontiff facilitated the intercour&s;e of nations, and tended to bind
Europe into an immen&s;e republic. And the pomp and &s;plendour of wor&s;hip,
which belonged to &s;o opulent an e&s;tabli&s;hment, contri|buted, in &s;ome
re&s;pects, to the encouragement of the fine arts, and began to diffu&s;e a
general elegance of ta&s;te, by uniting it with religion.</P>
<P>IT will ea&s;ily be conceived, that, tho' the ballance of evil
prevailed in the Romi&s;h church, this was not the chief rea&s;on, which
produced the reformation. A concurrence of incidents mu&s;t have contributed to
forward that great work.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="124"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin of the reformation.</NOTE> POPE Leo the
tenth, by his generous and enterprizing temper, had very much ex|hau&s;ted the
trea&s;ury, and was obliged to make u&s;e of every invention, which might yield
money, in order to &s;upport his projects, plea&s;ures, and liberalities. The
&s;cheme of &s;elling indulgences was &s;ugge&s;ted to him, as an expedient
which had often &s;erved in former times to draw money from the chri&s;tian
world, and make devout people willing contributors to the grandeur and riches
of the court of Rome. The church, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
a great &s;tock of merit, as being intitled to all the good works of the
&s;aints, beyond what were employed in their own ju&s;tification; and even to
the merits of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, which were infinite and unbounded: And from
this unexhau&s;ted trea&s;ury, the pope might retail particular portions, and
by that traffic acquire money, to be employed in pious purpo&s;es, the
re&s;i&s;ting the Turk, or &s;ubduing &s;chi&s;matics. When the money came into
his trea&s;ury, the greate&s;t part of it was u&s;ually diverted to other
purpo&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul and Sleidan.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is commonly believed, that Leo, from the penetration of his
genius, and his familiarity with literature, was fully acquainted with the
ridicule and fallacy of the doctrines, which, as &s;upreme pontiff, he was
obliged by his intere&s;t to promote: And it is the le&s;s wonder, therefore,
that he employed for his profit tho&s;e pious frauds, which his
predece&s;&s;ors, the mo&s;t ignorant and credulous, had always, under
plau&s;ible pretexts, made u&s;e of for their &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es. He
publi&s;hed the &s;ale of a general indulgence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In 1517.</NOTE>; and as his expences had not only exhau&s;ted his
u&s;ual revenue, but even anticipated the income of this extraordinary
expedient, the &s;everal branches of it were openly given away to particular
per|&s;ons, who were entitled to levy the impo&s;ition. The produce
particularly of Saxony and the countries bordering on the Baltic was
a&s;&s;igned to his &s;i&s;ter, Mag|dalene, married to Cibo, natural &s;on of
Innocent the eighth; and &s;he, in order to enhance her profit, had farmed out
the revenue to one Arcemboldi, a Genoe&s;e, now a bi&s;hop, formerly a
merchant, who &s;till retained all the lucrative arts of his former
profe&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, Sleidan.</NOTE>. The
Au&s;tin friars had u&s;ually been employed in Saxony to preach the
indulgences, and from this tru&s;t had derived both profit and
con&s;i|deration: But Arcemboldi, fearing, le&s;t practice might have taught
them means to &s;ecret the money<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib.
1.</NOTE>, and expecting no extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s from the ordinary methods
of collection, gave this occupation to the dominicans. The&s;e monks, in order
to prove them&s;elves worthy of the di&s;tinction conferred on them,
exag|gerated the benefit of indulgences by the mo&s;t unbounded panegyrics; and
ad|vanced doctrines on that head, which, tho' not more ridiculous than tho&s;e
al|ready received, were &s;uch as the ears of the people were not yet fully
accu&s;tomed <PB N="120" REF="125"> to. To add to the &s;candal, the collectors
of this revenue are &s;aid to have lived very licentious lives, and to have
&s;pent in taverns, gaming hou&s;es, and places &s;till more infamous, the
money, which devout per&s;ons had &s;aved from their u&s;ual expences, in order
to purcha&s;e a remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father
Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e circum&s;tances might have given offence, but would
have been at|tended with no event of any importance, had there not ari&s;en a
man, qualified to take advantage of the incident. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin Lu|ther.</NOTE> Martin Luther, an
Au&s;tin friar, profe&s;&s;or in the univer&s;ity of Wirtemberg, re&s;enting
the affront put upon his order, began to preach again&s;t the&s;e abu&s;es in
the &s;ale of indulgences; and being naturally of a fiery temper, and being
provoked by oppo&s;ition, he proceeded even to decry indulgences them&s;elves;
and was thence carried, by the heat of di&s;pute, to que&s;tion the authority
of the pope, from which his adver&s;aries derived their chief arguments
again&s;t him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, Sleidan.</NOTE>.
Still as he enlarged his reading, in order to &s;upport the&s;e tenets, he
di&s;covered &s;ome new abu&s;e or error in the church of Rome; and finding his
opinions greedily hearkened to, he promulgated them by writing, di&s;cour&s;es,
&s;ermons, conferences; and daily encrea&s;ed the number of his di&s;ciples.
All Saxony, all Germany, all Europe were in a very little time filled with the
voice of this daring innovator; and men, rouzed from that lethargy, in which
they had &s;o long &s;lept, began to call in que&s;tion the mo&s;t antient and
mo&s;t re|ceived opinions. The elector of Saxony, favourable to Luther's
doctrine, pro|tected him from the violence of the papal juri&s;diction: The
republic of Zuric even reformed their church according to the new model: Many
&s;overeigns of the empire, and the imperial diet it&s;elf, &s;howed a
favourable di&s;po&s;ition towards it: And Luther, a man naturally inflexible,
vehement, opinionative, was be|come incapable, either from promi&s;es of
advancement, or terrors of &s;everity, to relinqui&s;h a &s;ect, of which he
was him&s;elf the founder, and which brought him a glory, &s;uperior to all
others, the glory of dictating the religious faith and prin|ciples of
multitudes.</P>
<P>THE rumour of the&s;e innovations &s;oon reached England; and as
there &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in that kingdom great remains of the Lollards,
who&s;e principles re&s;embled tho&s;e of Luther, the new doctrines gained
&s;ecretly many partizans among the laiety of all ranks and denominations.
Henry had been educated in a &s;trict at|tachment to the church of Rome, and he
bore a particular prejudice again&s;t Luther, who, in his writings, &s;poke
with contempt of Thomas Aquinas, the King's favourite author: He oppo&s;ed
him&s;elf therefore to the progre&s;s of the Lutheran tenets, by all the
influence which his exten&s;ive and almo&s;t ab&s;olute au|thority 
<PB N="121" REF="126"> conferred upon him: He even undertook to combat them
with weapons not u&s;ually employed by monarchs, e&s;pecially tho&s;e in the
flower of their age, and force of their pa&s;&s;ions. He wrote a book in Latin
again&s;t the principles of Luther; a performance, which, if allowance be made
for the &s;ubject and the age, does no di&s;credit to his capacity. He &s;ent a
copy of it to Leo, who re|ceived &s;o magnificent a pre&s;ent with great
te&s;timony of regard; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry re|ceives the title of defender of the
faith.</NOTE> and conferred on him, the title of <HI>defender of the
faith;</HI> an appellation &s;till retained by the Kings of England. Luther,
who was in the heat of controver&s;y, &s;oon wrote an an&s;wer to Henry; and
without regard to the dignity of his antagoni&s;t, treated him with all the
acrimony of &s;tyle, to which, in the cour&s;e of his polemics, he had &s;o
long been accu&s;tomed. The King, by this ill u&s;age, was &s;till more
preju|diced again&s;t the new doctrines; but the public, who naturally favour
the weaker party, were inclined to attribute to Luther the victory in the
di&s;pute<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>. And as
the controver&s;y became more illu&s;trious, by Henry's entering the li&s;ts,
it drew more the attention of mankind; and the Lutheran doctrine acquired daily
new converts in every part of Europe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cau&s;es of the progre&s;s of the
reformation.</NOTE> THE quick and &s;urprizing progre&s;s of this bold &s;ect
may ju&s;tly in part be a&s;cribed to the late invention of printing, and
revival of learning: Not that rea&s;on bore any con&s;iderable part, in opening
men's eyes with regard to the im|po&s;tures of the Romi&s;h church: For of all
branches of literature, philo&s;ophy had, as yet, and till long afterwards,
made the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable progre&s;s; neither is there any in&s;tance
where argument has been able to free the people from that enormous load of
ab&s;urdity, with which &s;uper&s;tition has every where over|whelmed them: Not
to mention, that the rapid advance of the Lutheran doc|trine, and the violence,
with which it was embraced, prove &s;ufficiently, that it owed not its
&s;ucce&s;s to rea&s;on and reflection. The art of printing and the revival of
learning forwarded its progre&s;s in another manner. By means of that art, the
books of Luther and his &s;ectaries, full of vehemence, declamation and a rude
eloquence, were propagated more quickly, and in greater numbers. The minds of
men, &s;omewhat awakened from a profound &s;leep of &s;o many centuries, were
prepared for every novelty, and &s;crupled le&s;s to tread in any unu&s;ual
path, which was opened to them. And as copies of the &s;criptures and other
antient monu|ments of the chri&s;tian faith became more common, men perceived
the innova|tions, which were introduced after the fir&s;t centuries; and though
argument and rea&s;oning could not give conviction, an hi&s;torical fact, well
&s;upported, was able to make impre&s;&s;ion on their under&s;tandings. Many of
the powers, indeed, a&s;&s;umed by the church of Rome, were very antient, and
were prior to almo&s;t every <PB N="122" REF="127"> political government
e&s;tabli&s;hed in Europe: But as the eccle&s;ia&s;tics would not &s;ubmit to
po&s;&s;e&s;s their privileges as matters of civil right, which time could
ren|der valid, but appealed &s;till to a divine origin, men were tempted to
look into their primitive charter; and they could, without much difficulty,
perceive its defect in truth and authenticity.</P>
<P>IN order to be&s;tow on this topic the greater influence, Luther
and his followers, not &s;atisfied with oppo&s;ing the pretended divinity of
the Romi&s;h church, and di&s;playing the temporal inconveniencies of that
e&s;tabli&s;hment, carried matters much farther, and treated the religion of
their ance&s;tors, as abominable, dete&s;t|able, damnable; foretold by &s;acred
writ it&s;elf as the &s;ource of all wickedne&s;s and pollution. They
denominated the pope antichri&s;t, called his communion the &s;carlet whore,
and gave to Rome the appellation of Babylon; expre&s;&s;ions, which, however
applied, were to be found in &s;cripture, and which were better calculated to
operate on the multitude than the mo&s;t &s;olid arguments. Excited by
conte&s;t and per&s;ecution on the one hand, by &s;ucce&s;s and applau&s;e on
the other, many of the reformers carried their oppo&s;ition to the greate&s;t
extremity again&s;t the church of Rome; and in contradiction to the multiplied
&s;uper&s;titions, with which that communion was loaded, they adopted an

rites or ceremonies, but placed all merit in a my&s;terious &s;pecies of faith,
in inward vi&s;ion, rapture, and extacy. The new &s;ectaries, &s;eized with
this &s;pirit, were indefatigable in the propagation of their doctrine, and
&s;et at defiance all the anathemas and puni&s;hments, with which the Roman

<P>THAT the civil power, however, might afford them protection
again&s;t the eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, the Lutherans advanced
doctrines favourable, in &s;ome re&s;pects, to the temporal authority of
&s;overeigns. They inveighed again&s;t the abu&s;es of the court of Rome, with
which men were at that time generally di&s;|contented; and exhorted princes to
rein&s;tate them&s;elves in tho&s;e powers, of which the incroaching &s;pirit
of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and e&s;pecially of the &s;overeign pontiff, had &s;o
long bereaved them. They condemned celibacy and mona&s;tic vows, and thereby
opened the doors of the convents to tho&s;e who were either tired of the
obedience and cha&s;tity, or di&s;gu&s;ted with the licence, in which they had
hitherto lived. They blamed the exce&s;&s;ive riches, the idlene&s;s, the
libertin|i&s;m of the clergy; and pointed out their trea&s;ures and revenues as
lawful &s;poil to the fir&s;t invader. And as the eccle&s;ia&s;tics had
hitherto conducted a willing and a &s;tupid audience, and were totally
unacquainted with controver&s;y, and even every &s;pecies of literature; they
were unable to defend them&s;elves again&s;t men, armed with authorities,
citations, and popular topics, and qualified to triumph in every 
<PB N="123" REF="128"> altercation or debate. Such were the advantages, with
which the reformers be|gan their attack of the Roman hierarchy; and &s;uch were
the cau&s;es of their rapid and a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> THE King declared war
again&s;t France; and this mea&s;ure was founded on &s;o little rea&s;on, that
he could allege nothing as a ground of quarrel, but Francis's refu&s;al to
&s;ubmit to his arbitration, and his &s;ending Albany into Scotland. This
la&s;t &s;tep had not been taken by the French King, till he was quite
a&s;&s;ured of Henry's re&s;olution to attack him. Surrey landed &s;ome troops
at Cherbourg in Normandy; and after laying wa&s;te the country, he
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ailed to Morlaix, a rich town in
Britanny, which he took and plundered. The Engli&s;h merchants had great
property in that place, which was no more &s;pared by the &s;oldiers, than the
goods of the French. Surrey then left the charge of the fleet to the
vice-admi|ral; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ailed to
Calais, where he took the command of the Engli&s;h army, de&s;tined for the
inva&s;ion of France. This army, when joined by forces from the Low Countries
under the command of the count of Buren, con&s;i&s;ted in the whole of 18,000
men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion of France.</NOTE> THE French had
made it a maxim in all their wars with the Engli&s;h, &s;ince the reign of
Charles the fifth, never, without great nece&s;&s;ity, to hazard a general
engagement; and the duke of Vendome, who commanded the French army, now
embraced this wi&s;e policy. He &s;upplied the towns mo&s;t expo&s;ed,
e&s;pecially Boulogne, Montreuil, Tero&uuml;enne, Hedin, with &s;trong
garri&s;ons and plenty of provi&s;ions: He him&s;elf took po&s;t at Abbeville,
with &s;ome Swi&s;s and French in|fantry, and a body of cavalry: The count of
Gui&s;e encamped under Montreuil with &s;ix thou&s;and men. The&s;e two bodies
were in a &s;ituation to join upon oc|ca&s;ion; to throw &s;uccour into any
town, that was threatened; and to harra&s;s the Engli&s;h in every movement.
Surrey, who was not &s;upplied with magazines, fir&s;t divided his army for the
convenience of &s;ubli&s;ting them; but finding that his quarters were every
moment beaten up by the activity of the French gene|rals, he drew together the
forces, and laid &s;iege to Hedin. But neither did he &s;ucceed in this
enterprize. The garri&s;on made vigorous &s;allies upon his army: The French
forces a&s;&s;aulted them from without: Great rains fell: Fatigue and bad
weather threw the &s;oldiers into dy&s;enteries: And Surrey was obliged to
rai&s;e the &s;iege, and put his troops into winter quarters about the end of
October. His rear guard was attacked at Pas in Artois; and five or &s;ix
hundred men were cut off; nor could all his efforts make him ma&s;ter of one
place within the French frontier.</P>
<P>THE allies were more &s;ucce&s;sful in Italy. Lautrec, who
commanded the French, lo&s;t a bloody battle at Bicocca near Milan; and was
obliged to retire with the remains of his army. This misfortune, which
proceeded from Francis's negligence in not &s;upplying Lautrec with money<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 14.</NOTE>, was followed by the lo&s;s of
<PB N="125" REF="130"> Genoa. The ca&s;tle of Cremona was the &s;ole fortre&s;s

<P>EUROPE was now in &s;uch a &s;ituation, and &s;o connected by
alliances and intere&s;t, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for war to be
kindled in one part, and not diffu&s;e it&s;elf thro' the whole: But of all the
leagues among kingdoms, the clo&s;e&s;t was that which had &s;o long

and prepared to pa&s;s the borders at Solway-Firth. But many of the nobility
were di&s;gu&s;ted with the regent's admini&s;tration; and ob&s;erving, that
his connexions with his native country were very feeble in compari&s;on of
tho&s;e with France, they murmured, that for the &s;ake of foreign

their King's minority, be wantonly entered into with a neighbouring nation,
&s;o much &s;uperior in force and riches. The Gordons, in particular, refu&s;ed
to advance any farther; and Albany, ob&s;erving a general di&s;content to
prevail, was obliged to conclude a truce with lord Dacres, warden of the
Engli&s;h we&s;t marches. Soon after, he departed for France; and le&s;t the

too long been &s;acrificed to tho&s;e of the French nation, who, whenever they
found them&s;elves reduced to difficulties, called for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
their allies, but were ready to abandon them, &s;o &s;oon as they found their
advantage in making peace with England: That where a &s;mall &s;tate entered
into &s;o clo&s;e a confederacy with a greater, it mu&s;t always expect this
treatment, as a con&s;equence of the unequal alliance; but that there were
peculiar circum&s;tances in the &s;ituation of the king|doms, which, in the
pre&s;ent ca&s;e, rendered it inevitable: That France was &s;o di&s;tant and
&s;o divided from them by &s;eas, that &s;he &s;carce could by any means, and
never could in time, &s;end &s;uccours to the Scotch, &s;ufficient to protect
them again&s;t ravages from the neighbouring kingdom: That nature had, in a
manner, framed an alliance between the two Briti&s;h nations; having enclo&s;ed
them in the &s;ame i&s;land; given them the &s;ame manners, language, laws, and
form of govern|ment; and prepared every thing for an intimate union between
them: And that, if national antipathies were aboli&s;hed, which would &s;oon be
the effect of peace, the&s;e two kingdoms, &s;ecured by the ocean and by their
dome&s;tic force, could &s;et at defiance all foreign enemies, and remain for
ever &s;ecure and unmole&s;ted.</P>
<P>THE partizans of the French alliance &s;aid, on the other hand,
that the very rea&s;ons, which were urged in favour of a league with England,
the clo&s;e neigh|bourhood of the kingdom and its &s;uperior force, were the
real cau&s;es, why a &s;incere and durable confederacy could never be framed
with that ho&s;tile nation: That among neighbouring &s;tates, occa&s;ions of
quarrel were frequent; and the more powerful people would be &s;ure to &s;eize
every frivolous pretence for oppre&s;&s;ing the weaker, and reducing them to
&s;ubjection: That as the near neighbourhood of France and England had kindled
a war almo&s;t perpetual between them, it was the intere&s;t of the Scotch, if
they wi&s;hed to maintain their independancy, to pre&s;erve their league with
the former kingdom, which balanced the force of the latter: That if they
de&s;erted that old and &s;alutary alliance, on which their importance in
Europe chiefly depended, their antient enemies, &s;timulated both by intere&s;t
and by pa&s;&s;ion, would &s;oon invade them with &s;uperior force, and reduce
them to &s;ub|jection: Or if they delayed the attack, the in&s;idious peace, by
making the Scotch lo&s;e the u&s;e of arms, would only prepare the way for a
&s;lavery more certain and more irretrieveable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchannan, lib. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE arguments employed by the French party, being &s;econded by
the natural prejudices of the people, &s;eemed rather to prevail: And when the
regent him&s;elf, who had been long detained beyond his appointed time by the
terror of the Engli&s;h <PB N="127" REF="132"> fleet, at la&s;t appeared among
them, he was able to throw the balance entirely on that &s;ide. By the
authority of the convention of &s;tates, he a&s;&s;embled an army, with a view
of avenging the ravages committed by the Engli&s;h in the beginning of the
campaign; and he led them &s;outhwards towards the borders. But when they were
pa&s;&s;ing the Tweed at the bridge of Melro&s;s, the Engli&s;h party were
again able to rai&s;e &s;uch oppo&s;ition, that Albany thought proper to make a
retreat. He marched downwards, along the banks of the Tweed, keeping that river
on his right; and fixed his camp oppo&s;ite to Werk-Ca&s;tle, which Surrey had
lately repaired. He &s;ent over &s;ome troops to be&s;iege that fortre&s;s, who
made a breach in it, and &s;tormed &s;ome of the outworks: But the regent,
hearing of the ap|proach of an Engli&s;h army, and di&s;couraged by the
advanced &s;ea&s;on, thought proper to di&s;band his forces and retire to
Edinburgh. Soon after he went over to France, and never again returned to
Scotland. The Scotch nation, agitated by their dome&s;tic factions, were not,
during &s;everal years, in a condition to give any more di&s;turbance to
England; and Henry had full lei&s;ure to pro&s;ecute his de&s;igns on the
continent.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on, why the war again&s;t France proceeded &s;o
&s;lowly on the part of England was the want of money. All Henry the
&s;eventh's trea&s;ures were long &s;ince di&s;&s;ipated; the King's habits of
expence &s;till remained; and his revenues were unequal even to the ordinary
&s;upport of his government, much more to his military enterprizes. He had
la&s;t year cau&s;ed a general &s;urvey to be made of the kingdom; the numbers
of men, their years, profe&s;&s;ion, &s;tock, revenue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Stowe, 514.</NOTE>; and expre&s;&s;ed great
&s;atisfaction on finding the nation &s;o opulent. He then i&s;&s;ued out privy
&s;eals to the mo&s;t wealthy, demanding loans of particular &s;ums; and this
act of power, tho' &s;omewhat irregular and tyrannical, had been formerly
practi&s;ed by the Kings of England; and the people were now familiarized to
it. But Henry carried his authority much farther on this occa&s;ion. He
i&s;&s;ued an edict for a general tax upon his &s;ubjects, which he &s;till
called a loan; and he levied five &s;hillings in the pound from the clergy, two
&s;hillings from the laity. This pre|tended loan, as being more regular, was
really more dangerous to the liberties of the people; and was a precedent for
the King's impo&s;ing taxes without con&s;ent of Parliament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15th of April.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> HENRY &s;ummoned a
Parliament this year, together with a convocation; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ound neither of them in a
di&s;po&s;ition to complain of the infringement of their privileges. It was
only doubted, how far they would carry their liberality to the King. Wol&s;ey,
who had undertaken the management of this affair, began with 
<PB N="128" REF="133"> the convocation; in hopes, that their example would
influence the Parliament to grant a large &s;upply. He demanded a moiety of
their eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues to be levied in five years, or two
&s;hillings in the pound during that time, and tho' he met with oppo&s;ition,
he reprimanded &s;o &s;everely the refractory members, that his reque&s;t was
at la&s;t complied with. The cardinal afterwards, attended by &s;everal of the
nobility and prelates, came to the hou&s;e of commons; and in a long and
elaborate &s;peech laid before them the public nece&s;&s;ities, the dangers of
an inva&s;ion from Scotland, the affronts received from France, the league in
which the King was engaged with the pope and the emperor; and he demand|ed a
grant of 800,000 pounds, divided into four yearly payments; a &s;um, com|puted
from the late &s;urvey or valuation, to be equivalent to four &s;hillings in
the pound of one year's revenue, or one &s;hilling in the pound yearly,
according to the divi&s;ion propo&s;ed. So large a grant was unu&s;ual from the
commons; and tho' the cardinal's demand was &s;econded by Sir Thomas More the
&s;peaker, and &s;everal other members attached to the court, the hou&s;e could
not be prevailed with to comply<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Stowe,
518. Parliamentary Hi&s;tory. Strype, vol. I. p. 49, 50.</NOTE>. They only
voted two &s;hillings in the pound on all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of twenty pounds a
year and upwards, one &s;hilling on all between twenty pounds and forty
&s;hillings a year; and on all the re&s;t of the &s;ubjects above &s;ixteen
years of age a groat a-head. This la&s;t &s;um was divided into two yearly
payments; the former into four yearly payments, and was not therefore at the
outmo&s;t above &s;ix-pence in the pound. The grant of the commons was but the
moiety of the &s;um demanded; and the cardinal, therefore, much mortified with
the di&s;appointment, came again to the hou&s;e, and de&s;ired to rea&s;on with
&s;uch as refu&s;ed to comply with the King's reque&s;t. He was told, that it
was a rule of the hou&s;e never to rea&s;on but among them&s;elves; and his
de&s;ire was rejected. The commons, however, enlarged a little their former
grant, and voted an impo&s;ition of three &s;hillings in the pound on all
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of fifty pounds a year, and upwards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;aid, that when Henry heard that the commons made a great

irregularities were commonly a&s;cribed to the cardinal's coun|&s;els, who,
tru&s;ting to the protection, afforded him by his eccle&s;ia&s;tical character,
was le&s;s &s;crupulous in his encroachments on the civil rights of the
nation.</P>
<P>THAT ambitious prelate received this year a new di&s;appointment
in his a&s;piring views. The pope, Adrian the &s;ixth, died; and Clement the
&s;eventh, of the family of Medici, was elected in his place, by the
concurrence of the imperial party. Wol&s;ey began now to perceive the
in&s;incerity of the emperor, and concluded that that prince would never
&s;econd his preten&s;ions to the papal chair. This injury was highly
re&s;ented by the cardinal; and he began thenceforth to e&s;trange him|&s;elf
from the imperial court, and to pave the way for an union between his ma&s;|ter
and the French King. Meanwhile, he di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entment; and after
congratulating the new pope on his promotion, applied for a continuation of the
legantine powers, which the two former popes had conferred upon him. Clement,
knowing the importance of gaining his friend&s;hip, granted him a
commi&s;&s;ion for life; and by this unu&s;ual conce&s;&s;ion, he in a manner
transferred to him the whole papal authority in England. In &s;ome particulars,
Wol&s;ey made a good u&s;e of this exten&s;ive power. He erected two colleges,
one at Oxford, another at Ip&s;wich, the place of his nativity: He &s;ought,
all over Europe, for learned men to &s;upply the chairs of the&s;e colleges:
And in order to be&s;tow endowments on them, he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;ome
&s;maller mona&s;teries, and di&s;tributed the monks into other con|vents. The
execution of this project became the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s difficult for him, that the Romi&s;h church began to perceive,
that &s;he over-abounded in monks, and that &s;he wanted &s;ome &s;upply of
learning, in order to oppo&s;e the inqui&s;itive, or rather di&s;putative,
humour of the new reformers.</P>

the mo&s;t &s;hining merit; and, be&s;ide di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf in many
military enterprizes, he was adorned with every accompli&s;hment, which became
a per&s;on of his high &s;tation. His virtues, embelli&s;hed with the graces of
youth, had made &s;uch im|pre&s;&s;ion on Loui&s;e of Savoy, Francis's mother,
that, without regard to the in|equality of their years, &s;he made him
propo&s;als of marriage; and meeting with a refu&s;al, &s;he formed &s;chemes
of unrelenting vengeance again&s;t him. She was a woman, fal&s;e, deceitful,
vindictive, malicious; but, unhappily for France, had by her capacity, which
was con&s;iderable, acquired an ab&s;olute a&s;cendant over her &s;on. By her
in&s;tigation, Francis put many affronts on the con&s;table, which it was
difficult for a gallant &s;pirit to endure; and at la&s;t he permitted Loui&s;e
to pro&s;ecute a law&s;uit again&s;t him, by which, under the mo&s;t frivolous
pretences, he was deprived of his ample po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and inevitable
ruin was brought upon him.</P>
<P>BOURBON, provoked at all the&s;e indignities, and thinking,
that, if any in|juries could ju&s;tify a man in rebelling again&s;t his prince
and country, he mu&s;t &s;tand acquitted, had entered into a &s;ecret
corre&s;pondence with the emperor and the King of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires du Bellay, liv. 2.</NOTE>. Francis, pertinacious in his
de&s;ign of recovering the the Milane&s;e, had propo&s;ed to lead his army in
per&s;on into Italy; and Bourbon, who feigned &s;ickne&s;s, in order to have a
pretence for &s;taying behind, intended, &s;o &s;oon as the King had pa&s;&s;ed
the Alps, to rai&s;e an in&s;urrection among his nu|merous va&s;&s;als, by whom
he was extremely beloved, and to introduce foreign enemies into the heart of
the kingdom. Francis got intimation of his de&s;ign; but not being prompt
enough in &s;ecuring &s;o dangerous a foe, the con&s;table made his
e&s;cape<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Belcarius, lib. 17.</NOTE>; and putting
him&s;elf in the emperor's &s;ervice, did all the injuries to his native
country, which his enterprizing &s;pirit and his great talents for war enabled
him to perform. Charles profe&s;&s;ed &s;uch regard for him, that he promi&s;ed
him his &s;i&s;ter in marriage, Eleonora, widow to Emanuel, King of Portugal;
and when the con&s;table came to Madrid, &s;ome time after, the emperor
received him with all the demon&s;trations of friend&s;hip. He &s;aid to a
Spani&s;h grandee, that he mu&s;t <PB N="131" REF="136"> de&s;ire him, while
Bourbon re&s;ided in that city, to allow him to take up his re|&s;idence in his
hou&s;e, as mo&s;t &s;uitable to his rank and quality. The nobleman replied,
with a Ca&s;tilian dignity, that his maje&s;ty's de&s;ire was to him a
&s;ufficient rea&s;on; but he mu&s;t tell him beforehand, that &s;o &s;oon as
Bourbon departed he would raze to the ground the hou&s;e which had been
polluted by the pre&s;ence of &s;uch a traitor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gulcciardini</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King of England, de&s;irous that Francis &s;hould undertake
his Italian ex|pedition, did not openly threaten Picardy this year with an
inva&s;ion; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th Augu&s;t.</NOTE> and it was late before
the duke of Suffolk, who commanded the Engli&s;h forces, pa&s;&s;ed over to
Calais. He was attended with the lords Montacute, Herbert, Ferrars, Morney,
Sandys, Berkeley, Powis, and many other noblemen and gentlemen<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>. The Engli&s;h army, reinforced by
&s;ome troops, drawn from the garri&s;on of Calais, amounted to about 12,000
men; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion of France.</NOTE> and having joined
an equal number of Flemings under the count of Buren, they prepared for an
inva&s;ion of France. The &s;iege of Boulogne was fir&s;t propo&s;ed; but that
enterprize appearing difficult, it was thought more advi&s;eable to leave this
town behind them. The frontier of Picardy was very ill provided of troops; and
the only defence of that pro|vince was the activity of the French officers, who
infe&s;ted the allied army in their march, and threw garri&s;ons, with great
expedition, into every town, which was threatened by them. After coa&s;ting the
Somme, and pa&s;&s;ing Hedin, Montreuil, Dourlens, the Engli&s;h and Flemings
pre&s;ented them&s;elves before Bray, a place of &s;mall force, which commanded
a bridge over the Somme. Here they were re&s;olved to pa&s;s, and, if
po&s;&s;ible, to take up winter quarters in France; but Crequi threw him&s;elf
into the town, and &s;eemed determined to defend it. The allies attacked him
with vigour and &s;ucce&s;s; and when he retreated over the bridge, they
pur&s;ued him &s;o hotly, that they allowed him not time to break it down, but
pa&s;&s;ed it along with him, and put him to route. They next advanced to
Montdidier, which they be&s;ieged and took by capitulation. Meeting with no
oppo&s;ition, they proceeded to the river Oi&s;e, within eleven leagues of
Paris, and threw that city into great con&s;ternation; till the duke of Vendome
ha&s;tened with &s;ome forces to its relief. The confederates, then, afraid of
being &s;urrounded, and reduced to extremities during &s;o advanced a
&s;ea&s;on, thought proper to retire. Montdidier was abandoned: And the
Engli&s;h and Flemings went each into their own country.</P>
<P>FRANCE defended her&s;elf from the other inva&s;ions with equal
facility and equal good &s;o tune. Twelve thou&s;and Lan&s;quenets broke into
Burgundy under the command of the count of Fu&s;temberg. The count of Gui&s;e,
who defended <PB N="132" REF="137"> that frontier, had nothing to oppo&s;e to
them but &s;ome militia, and about nine hundred heavy-armed cavalry. He threw
the militia into the garri&s;on-towns; and with his cavalry, he kept the field,
and &s;o harra&s;&s;ed the Germans, that they were glad to make their retreat
into Lorraine. Gui&s;e attacked them as they pa&s;&s;ed the Meu&s;e, put them
into di&s;order, and cut off the greate&s;t part of their rear.</P>
<P>THE emperor made great preparations on the &s;ide of Navarre;
and, tho' that frontier was well guarded by nature, it &s;eemed now expo&s;ed
to great danger from this powerful inva&s;ion which threatened it. Charles
be&s;ieged Fontarabia, which had fallen a few years before into Francis's
hands; and when he had drawn thither Lautrec, the French general, he rai&s;ed
the &s;iege of a &s;udden, and &s;at down before Bayonne. Lautrec, aware of
that &s;tratagem, made a &s;udden march and threw him&s;elf into Bayonne, which
he defended with &s;uch vigour and courage, that the Spaniards were
con&s;trained to rai&s;e the &s;iege. The emperor would have been totally
unfortunate on this &s;ide, had he not turned back upon Fon|tarabia, and,
contrary to the advice of all his generals, &s;at down, in the winter
&s;ea&s;on, before that city, well fortified and &s;trongly garri&s;oned. The
cowardice or mi&s;conduct of the governor &s;aved him the &s;hame of a new
di&s;appointment. The place was &s;urrendered in a few days; and the emperor,
having fini&s;hed this enterprize, put his troops into winter quarters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Italian wars.</NOTE> SO ob&s;tinate was
Francis in pro&s;ecuting his Italian expedition, that, notwith|&s;tanding
the&s;e dangerous inva&s;ions, with which his kingdom was menaced on every
&s;ide, he had determined to lead in per&s;on a powerful army to the conque&s;t
of Milan. The intelligence of Bourbon's revolt and e&s;cape &s;topped him at
Lyons; and fearing &s;ome in&s;urrection in the kingdom from the intrigues of a
man &s;o powerful and &s;o beloved, he thought it prudent to remain in France;
and to &s;end for|ward his army, under the command of admiral Bonnivet. The
dutchy of Milan had been purpo&s;ely left in a condition &s;omewhat
defencele&s;s, with a view of al|luring Francis to attack it; and no &s;ooner
had Bonnivet pa&s;&s;ed the Te&s;in, than the army of the league, and even
Pro&s;per Colonna, who commanded it, a very prudent general, were in the
utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. It is agreed, that if Bonnivet had immediately advanced
to Milan, that great city, on which the whole dutchy depends, would have opened
its gates without re&s;i&s;tance: But as he wa&s;ted his time in frivolous
enterprizes, Colonna had opporunity to reinforce the garri&s;on, and to put the
place in a po&s;ture of defence. Bonnivet was now obliged to attempt reducing
the city by blockade and famine; and he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the
po&s;ts, which commanded the pa&s;&s;ages to it. But the army of the league,
mean-while, was not inactive; and they &s;o &s;traitened and harra&s;&s;ed the
quarters of the French, that it &s;eemed more likely the latter would
them&s;elves peri&s;h by famine, than <PB N="133" REF="138">
<MILESTONE N="1524" UNIT="year"> reduce the city to that extremity. Sickne&s;s
and fatigue and want had wa&s;ted them to &s;uch a degree, that they were ready
to rai&s;e the blockade; and their only hopes con&s;i&s;ted in a great body of
Swi&s;s, which was levied for the &s;ervice of the French king, and who&s;e
arrival was every day expected.</P>
<P>THE Swi&s;s had in that age &s;o great a &s;uperiority in the
field above almo&s;t every other nation, and had been &s;o much courted by all
the great potentates of Europe, that they were become extremely capricious and
haughty, and thought that the fate of kingdoms depended entirely on their
a&s;&s;i&s;tance or oppo&s;ition. Francis had promi&s;ed to this body of
mercenaries, whom he had hired to join Bonnivet, that &s;o &s;oon as they
arrived in the plains of Piedmont, the duke of Longueville &s;hould join them
with four hundred lances, and conduct them to the French camp: But by &s;ome
accident Longueville's march had been retarded, and the Swi&s;s had been
obliged to march, without the honour of being e&s;corted by him. Offended at
this neglect, as they interpreted it, they no &s;ooner came within &s;ight of
the French camp, than they &s;topped, and in&s;tead of joining Bon|nivet, they
&s;ent orders to a great body of their countrymen, who then &s;erved under him,
immediately to begin their march, and to return home in their company<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 15. Memoires du Bellay, liv.
2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this de&s;ertion of the Swi&s;s, Bonnivet had no other
choice, than that of making his retreat, as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, into
France. He accordingly put him&s;elf in motion for that purpo&s;e; but the
allies, who fore&s;aw this mea&s;ure, were ready to fall upon his rear. The
French army, however, after a &s;harp action, made good their retreat, tho' not
without con&s;iderable lo&s;s both in officers and pri|vate men. Among the
re&s;t, fell in this action the brave chevalier Bayard, e&s;teemed in that age
the model of &s;oldiers and men of honour, and denomi|nated the <HI>knight
without fear and without reproach.</HI> When this gallant gentleman felt his
wounds to be mortal, and could no longer &s;upport him&s;elf on hor&s;e|back,
he ordered his attendants to &s;et him under a tree, and turn his face to|wards
the enemy, that he might die in that po&s;ture. The generals of the al|lies,
and among the re&s;t the duke of Bourbon, came about him, and expre&s;&s;ed
their concern for his pre&s;ent condition. 
<Q REND="inline">"Pity not me," cried he to Bourbon; "I die in
the di&s;charge of my duty: They are to be pitied alone, who fight again&s;t
their prince and country<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel, vol. 3. p.
152.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THE French being thus expelled Italy, the pope, the Venetians,
the Flo|rentines were &s;atisfied with the advantage obtained over them, and
were re|&s;olved to pro&s;ecute their victory no farther. All the&s;e powers,
e&s;pecially Clement, had entertained a violent jealou&s;y of the emperor's
ambition; and <PB N="134" REF="139"> their jealou&s;y was extremely augmented,
when they &s;aw him refu&s;e the in|ve&s;titure of Milan, a fief of the empire,
to Francis Sforza, who&s;e title he had acknowledged, and who&s;e defence he
had embraced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 15.</NOTE>. They all
concluded, that he intended to put him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
important dutchy, and re|duce Italy to &s;ubjection: Clement in particular,
actuated by this jealou&s;y, pro|ceeded &s;o far in oppo&s;ition to the
emperor, that he &s;ent orders to his nuncio at London to mediate a
reconciliation between France and England. But affairs were not yet fully ripe
for this change. Wol&s;ey, di&s;gu&s;ted with the emperor, but &s;till more
actuated by vain-glory, was determined, that he him&s;elf &s;hould have the
renown of bringing about that great alteration; and he engaged the King to
reject the pope's mediation. A new treaty was even concluded between Henry and
Charles for the inva&s;ion of France. Charles &s;tipulated to &s;upply the duke
of Bourbon with a powerful army, in order to conquer Provence and Dauphiny:
Henry agreed to pay him a hundred thou&s;and crowns for the fir&s;t month;
after which, he might either chu&s;e to continue the &s;ame monthly pay|ments,
or invade Picardy with a powerful army. Bourbon was to po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e
provinces with the title of King; but to hold them in fief of Henry as King of
France. The dutchy of Burgundy was to be given to Charles: The re&s;t of the
Kingdom to Henry.</P>
<P>THIS chimerical partition immediately failed of execution in the
article, which was mo&s;t ea&s;ily performed: Bourbon refu&s;ed to acknowledge
Henry as King of France. His enterprize, however, again&s;t Provence &s;till
took place. A nu|merous army of imperiali&s;ts invaded that country under his
command and that of the marquis of Pe&s;cara. They laid &s;iege to
Mar&s;eilles, which, being weakly garri&s;oned, they expected to carry in a
little time: But the burge&s;&s;es defended them&s;elves with &s;uch valour and
ob&s;tinacy, that Bourbon and Pe&s;cara, who heard of the French King's
approach with a numerous army, found them&s;elves under a nece&s;&s;ity of
rai&s;ing the &s;iege; and they led their forces, much weakened, baffled, and
di&s;heartened, into Italy.</P>
<P>FRANCIS might now have enjoyed in &s;afety the glory of
repul&s;ing all his ene|mies, in every attempt which they had hitherto made of
breaking into his king|dom: But as he received intelligence, that the King of
England, di&s;couraged with his former fruitle&s;s enterprizes, and
di&s;gu&s;ted with the emperor, was mak|ing no preparations for the inva&s;ion
of Picardy, his antient ardour &s;eized him for the conque&s;t of Milan; and,
notwith&s;tanding the advanced &s;ea&s;on, he was immediately determined,
contrary to the advice of his wi&s;e&s;t coun&s;ellors, to lead his army into
Italy.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="140"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of France n|vades Italy.</NOTE> HE
pa&s;&s;ed the Alps at Mount Cenis, and no &s;ooner appeared in Piedmont, than
he threw the whole Milane&s;e into con&s;ternation. There was no army in the
field able to oppo&s;e him; and Milan it&s;elf, tho' affectionate to its duke,
was not in the &s;ame po&s;ture of defence as la&s;t year, when blockaded by
admiral Bonnivet. It was almo&s;t wholly de&s;titute of inhabitants: Great
numbers had died of the plague; and the re&s;t had fled into the country for
&s;afety. Francis immediately marched to that city, which opened its gates to
receive him. The forces of the emperor and Sforza fled to Lodi; and had Francis
been &s;o fortunate as to pur&s;ue them, they had abandoned that place, and had
been totally di&s;&s;ipated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardin, lib. 15. Du
Bellay, lib. 2.</NOTE>. But his ill fate led him to be&s;iege Pavia, a town of
con&s;iderable &s;trength, well-garri&s;oned, and de|fended by Leyva, one of
the brave&s;t officers in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice. Every at|tempt, which the
French king made to gain this important place, proved fruitle&s;s. He battered
the walls, and made breaches; but by the vigilance of Leyva, new retrenchments
were in&s;tantly thrown up behind the breaches: He attempted to divert the
cour&s;e of the Te&s;in, which ran by one &s;ide of the city, and defended it;
but an inundation of the river de&s;troyed in one night all the mounds which
the &s;oldiers, during a long time, and with infinite pains, had been erecting.
Fa|tigue and the bad &s;ea&s;on (for it was now the depth of winter) had
wa&s;ted the French army. <MILESTONE N="1525" UNIT="year"> And the more to
dimini&s;h its force, Francis, at the pope's &s;olli|citation, who now
declared, almo&s;t openly, for him, had detached a con&s;iderable body, under
the duke of Albany, to invade the kingdom of Naples. The im|perial generals
mean while were not idle. Pe&s;cara and Lannoy, viceroy of Na|ples, gathered
forces from all quarters. Bourbon, having pawned his jewels for money, went
into Germany, and by his per&s;onal intere&s;t, levied twelve thou&s;and
Lan&s;quenets, with which he joined the imperiali&s;ts. This army was advancing
to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Pavia; and the danger to the French became every day
more imminent.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of Europe was &s;uch, during that age, that, partly
from the want of commerce and indu&s;try every where, except in Italy and the
Low Countries, partly from the exten&s;ive privileges &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
by the people in all the great monarchies, and their frugal maxims in granting
money, the revenues of the princes were extremely narrow, and even the &s;mall
armies, which they kept on foot, could not be regularly paid by them. The
imperial forces, commanded by Bourbon, Pe&s;cara, and Lannoy, exceeded not
twenty thou&s;and men; they were the only body of troops maintained by the
emperor (for he had not been able to levy any army for the inva&s;ion of
France, either on the &s;ide of Spain or <PB N="136" REF="141"> Flanders). Yet
&s;o poor was that mighty monarch, that he could tran&s;mit no money for the
payment of this army; and it was chiefly the hopes of &s;haring the plunder of
the French camp, which had made them advance, and kept them to their
&s;tandards. Had Francis rai&s;ed the &s;iege before their approach, and
retired to Milan, they mu&s;t immediately have di&s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">t them&s;elves; and he had obtained a compleat victory,
without danger or blood&s;hed. But it was the character of this monarch, to
become ob&s;tinate in proportion to the difficulties which he encountered; and
having once &s;aid, that he would take Pavia or peri&s;h before it, he was
re&s;olved rather to endure the utmo&s;t extremities than depart from this
re&s;olution.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25 February.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Pa|via, and cap|tivity of
Francis.</NOTE> THE imperial generals, after cannonading the French camp for
&s;everal days, at la&s;t gave a general a&s;&s;ault, and broke into the
entrenchments. Leyva &s;allied from the town, and threw the be&s;iegers into
&s;till greater confu&s;ion. The Swi&s;s infantry, contrary to their u&s;ual
practice, behaved in a da&s;tardly manner, and de|&s;erted their po&s;t.
Francis's whole army was put to rout, and he him&s;elf, &s;ur|rounded by his
enemies, after fighting with the mo&s;t heroic valour, and killing &s;even men
with his own hand, was at la&s;t obliged to &s;urrender him&s;elf pri&s;oner.
Almo&s;t the whole army, full of nobility and brave officers, either peri&s;hed
by the &s;word, or were drowned in the river. The few, who e&s;caped with their
lives, fell into the hands of the enemy. The imperial generals had &s;o little
authority over their own troops, even after this &s;ignal victory, that Lannoy,
apprehen&s;ive left the Lan&s;quenets &s;hould &s;eize Francis as &s;ecurity
for the pay due to them, im|mediately removed him from the camp, and &s;ent him
to Pizzighitone. And taking advantage of the terrors, which had &s;eized the
pope, the Florentines, the Duke of Ferrara, and other Italian &s;tates, he
obliged them, tho' &s;ecretly ene|mies, to advance money for the
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence of his army.</P>
<P>THE emperor received this news by Pennalo&s;a, who pa&s;&s;ed
thro' France, by means of a &s;afe-conduct, which he received from the captive
King. The moderation, which he di&s;played on this occa&s;ion, had it been
real, would have done him great honour. In&s;tead of rejoicing, he
expre&s;&s;ed &s;ympathy with Francis's ill fortune, and di&s;covered his

expo&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vera.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. de Charle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> V.</NOTE>. He refu&s;ed the city of

&s;aid that he re&s;erved all his exultation till he &s;hould be able to obtain
&s;ome victory over the infidels. He &s;ent orders to his frontier garri&s;ons
to commit to ho&s;tilities upon France. He &s;poke of concluding immediately a
peace on rea&s;onable terms. But all this &s;eeming equity was only
hypocri&s;y, &s;o much the more dangerous, that it was profound. And his &s;ole
occupation was <PB N="137" REF="142"> the forming &s;chemes, how, from this
great incident, he might draw the utmo&s;t advantage, and gratify that
exorbitant ambition, by which, in all his actions, he was wholly governed.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Pennalo&s;a, in pa&s;&s;ing thro' France, carried
al&s;o a letter from Fran|cis to his mother, whom he had left regent, and who
then re&s;ided at Lyons. It contained only the&s;e few words, <HI>Madam, all is
lo&s;t, except our honour.</HI> The prince&s;s was &s;truck with the
greatne&s;s of the calamity. She &s;aw the kingdom without a &s;overeign,
without an army, without generals, without money; &s;ur|rounded on every hand
by implacable and victorious enemies: And her &s;ole re|&s;ource, in her
pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es, was the hope, which &s;he entertained, of peace and
even of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the King of England.</P>
<P>HAD the King entered into the war again&s;t France from any
concerted political views, it is evident, that the victory of Pavia, and the
captivity of Francis, were the mo&s;t fortunate incidents which could have
befallen him, and the only ones which could render his &s;chemes effectual.
While the war was carried on in the former feeble manner, without any
deci&s;ive advantage, he might have been able to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of
&s;ome frontier towns, or perhaps of a &s;mall territo|ry, which he could not
keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, without expending much more than its value. By
&s;ome great calamity alone, which annihilated the power of France, could he
hope to acquire the dominion of con&s;iderable provinces, or di&s;member that
mighty monarchy, &s;o affectionate to its own government and its own
&s;overeigns. But as it is probable, that Henry had never before carried his
reflections &s;o far; he was &s;tartled at this important event, and became
&s;en&s;ible of his own danger, as well as that of all Europe, from the lo&s;s
of a proper counterpoi&s;e to the great power of Charles. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry em|braces the al|liance of

after the victory of Pavia, gave him occa&s;ion to revive the King's jealou&s;y
and &s;u&s;picions of his ally. The emperor &s;upported &s;o ill the appearance
of moderation, which he at fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed, that he had already changed his

care&s;&s;es and profe&s;&s;ions, with which the emperor's letters to him were

<P>HENRY, tho' determined to embrace new mea&s;ures, was careful to
&s;ave appear|ances in the change; and he cau&s;ed rejoicings to be every where
made on account of the victory of Pavia, and the captivity of Francis. He
publicly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed a French envoy, whom he had formerly allowed,
notwith&s;tanding the war, to re|&s;ide at London<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Du Bellay, Liv. 3. Stow. p. 221. Baker, p. 273.</NOTE>: But upon
the regent's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive applications to him, he again opened a
corre&s;pondence with her; and be&s;ides a&s;&s;uring her of his friend|&s;hip
and protection, he exacted a promi&s;e, that &s;he never would con&s;ent to the
di&s;membering any province of the monarchy for her &s;on's ran&s;om. With the
emperor, however, he put on the appearance of vigour and enterprize; and in
order to have a pretence for breaking with him, he di&s;patched Ton&s;tal,
bi&s;hop of London, to Madrid, with propo&s;als for a powerful inva&s;ion of
France. He required, that Charles &s;hould immediately enter Guienne at the
head of a great army, in order to put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
province; and he demanded the payment of large &s;ums of money, which that
prince had borrowed from him in his la&s;t vi&s;it at London. He knew, that the
emperor was in no condition of exe|cuting either of the&s;e conditions; and
that he had as little inclination to make him ma&s;ter of &s;uch con&s;iderable
territories upon the frontiers of Spain.</P>
<P>TONSTAL likewi&s;e informed him, that Charles, on his part,
wanted not com|plaints again&s;t England; and in particular was di&s;plea&s;ed
with Henry, becau&s;e la&s;t year he had neither continued his monthly payments
to Bourbon, nor invaded Picardy, according to his &s;tipulations; that,
in&s;tead of expre&s;&s;ing his intentions to e&s;pou&s;e Mary, when &s;he
&s;hould be marriageable, he had hearkened to propo&s;als, for marrying his
niece I&s;abella, prince&s;s of Portugal; and that he had entered into a
&s;eparate treaty with Francis, and &s;eemed determined to reap alone all the
advantages of the &s;ucce&s;s, with which fortune had crowned his arms.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30 Augu&s;t.</NOTE> THE King, influenced by

Herbert.</NOTE>: The regent al&s;o, in another treaty, acknowledged the kingdom
to be Henry's debtor for one million eight hundred thou&s;and crowns, to be
di&s;charged in half yearly payments of fifty thou&s;and crowns: After which,
Henry was to re|ceive <PB N="139" REF="144"> during his own life, a yearly
pen&s;ion of a hundred thou&s;and crowns&punc; Not|with&s;tanding his
genero&s;ity, he could not for bear taking advantage of the cala|mitous
&s;ituation of France, in order to exact this lucrative condition from her. A
large pre&s;ent of a hundred thou&s;and crowns was al&s;o made Wol&s;ey, for
his good offices, but covered under the pretence of arrears due on the
pen&s;ion grant|ed him for relinqui&s;hing the admini&s;tration of Tournay.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, as Henry fore&s;aw, that this treaty with France
might involve him in a war with the emperor, he was al&s;o determined to fill
his trea&s;ury by im|po&s;itions upon his own &s;ubjects; and as the parliament
had di&s;covered &s;ome re|luctance in complying with his demands, he followed
the advice of Wol&s;ey, and re&s;olved to make u&s;e of his prerogative alone
for that purpo&s;e. He i&s;&s;ued out commi&s;&s;ions to all the counties of
England, for levying four &s;hillings in the pound from the clergy, three
&s;hillings and four pence from the laity; and &s;o un|controulable did he deem
his authority, that he took no care to cover, as former|ly, this arbitrary
exaction, even under the &s;lender pretence of a loan. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;contents of the Engli&s;h.</NOTE> But he
&s;oon found, that he had pre&s;umed too far on the pa&s;&s;ive
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of his &s;ubjects. The people, di&s;plea&s;ed with an exaction
beyond what was u&s;ually levied in tho&s;e days, but &s;till more
di&s;gu&s;ted with the illegal method of impo&s;ing it, broke out in murmurs,
complaints, oppo&s;ition to the commi&s;&s;ioners; and their refractory
di&s;|po&s;ition even threatened a general in&s;urrection. Henry had the
prudence to &s;top &s;hort, in that dangerous path, into which he had entered.
He &s;ent letters to all the counties; declaring, that he meant no force by
this la&s;t impo&s;ition, and that he would take nothing of his &s;ubjects but
by way of <HI>benevolence.</HI> He flatter|ed him&s;elf, that his
conde&s;cen&s;ion in employing that di&s;gui&s;e would &s;atisfy the people,
and that no one would dare to render him&s;elf obnoxious to royal autho|rity,
by refu&s;ing any payment required of him in this manner. But the &s;pirit of
oppo&s;ition was once rou&s;ed, and could not &s;o ea&s;ily be quieted at
plea&s;ure. A lawyer in the city objecting the &s;tatute of Richard the third,
by which benevo|lences were for ever aboli&s;hed, it was replied by the court,
that Richard being an u&s;urper, and his Parliaments factious a&s;&s;emblies,
his &s;tatutes could not bind a law|ful and <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> monarch, who
held his crown by hereditary right, and needed not to court the favour of a
licentious populace<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>. The judges even went &s;o
far as to affirm po&s;itively, that the King might exact by commi&s;&s;ion any
&s;um which he plea&s;ed; and the privy council gave a ready a&s;&s;ent to this
decree, which anni|hilated the mo&s;t valuable privilege of the people, and
rendered all their other privileges precarious. Armed with &s;uch formidable
authority, of royal preroga|tive and a pretext of law, Wol&s;ey &s;ent for the
mayor of London, and de&s;ired to <PB N="140" REF="145"> know what he was
willing to give for the &s;upply of his maje&s;ty's nece&s;&s;ities. The mayor
&s;eemed de&s;irous, before he &s;hould declare him&s;elf, to con&s;ult the
common council; but the cardinal required, that he and all the aldermen
&s;hould &s;eparately confer with him&s;elf about the benevolence; and he
eluded by that means the danger of formed oppo&s;ition. Matter, however, went
not &s;o &s;mooth|ly in the country. An in&s;urrection was begun in &s;ome
places; but as the people were not headed by any con&s;iderable per&s;on, it
was ea&s;y for the duke of Suffolk, and the earl of Surrey, now duke of
Norfolk, by employing per&s;ua&s;ion and au|thority, to induce the ringleaders
to lay down their arms, and &s;urrender them|&s;elves pri&s;oners. The king,
finding it dangerous to puni&s;h criminals, engaged in &s;o popular a cau&s;e,
was determined, notwith&s;tanding his violent, imperious temper, to grant them
a general pardon; and he very prudently imputed their guilt, not to their want
of loyalty or affection, but to their poverty. The offen|ders were brought
before the &s;tar-chamber; where, after a &s;evere charge laid again&s;t them
by the King's council, the cardinal &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"That, notwith&s;tanding their grievous
offences, the King, in con&s;ideration of their nece&s;&s;ities, had granted
them his gracious pardon, upon condition, that they would give in &s;ureties
for their future good behaviour."</Q> But they replying, that they had no
&s;ureties, the cardinal fir&s;t, and after him the duke of Norfolk, &s;aid,
that they would &s;tand bound for them. Upon which they were di&s;charged<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Hall, Stow, 525. Hollin&s;hed, p.
891.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE arbitrary impo&s;itions, being generally imputed to the
cardinal's coun|&s;els, increa&s;ed the general odium, under which he laboured;
and the clemency of the pardon, being a&s;cribed to the King, was con&s;idered
as an atonement on his part for the illegality of the mea&s;ure. But Wol&s;ey,
&s;upported both by royal and papal authority, proceeded, without &s;cruple, to
violate all eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges, which, during that age, were much
more &s;acred than civil; and having once pre|vailed in that unu&s;ual attempt
of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;ome mona&s;teries, he kept all the re&s;t in awe, and
exerci&s;ed over them the mo&s;t arbitrary juri&s;diction. By his
commi&s;|&s;ion as legate, he was impowered to vi&s;it them, and reform them,
and cha&s;ti&s;e their irregularities; and he employed his u&s;ual agent,
Allen, in the exerci&s;e of this authority. The religious hou&s;es were obliged
to compound for their guilt, real or pretended, by giving large &s;ums to the
cardinal or his deputy; and this oppre&s;&s;ion was carried &s;o far, that it
reached at la&s;t the King's ears, which were not commonly open to complaints
again&s;t his favourite. He reproved Wol&s;ey in &s;evere terms, which rendered
him, if not more innocent, at lea&s;t more cauti|ous for the future. That
haughty mini&s;ter had built a &s;plendid palace at Hamp|ton court, which he
probably intended, as well as that of York place in We&s;t|min&s;ter, 
<PB N="141" REF="146"> mini&s;ter, for his own u&s;e; but fearing the
increa&s;e of envy on account of this magnificence, and de&s;irous to appea&s;e
the King, he made him a pre&s;ent of that building, and told him, that, from
the fir&s;t, he had erected it for his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>THE ab&s;olute authority, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the King,
rendered his dome&s;tic go|vernment, both over his people and his mini&s;ters,
ea&s;y and expeditious: The conduct of foreign affairs alone required effort
and application; and they were now brought to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that it was no
longer &s;afe for England to be entirely neutral. The feigned moderation of the
emperor was of very &s;hort date; and it was &s;oon obvious to all the world,
that his great dominions, far from gra|tifying his ambition, were only regarded
as the means of acquiring an empire more exten&s;ive. The terms, propo&s;ed by
him to his pri&s;oner, were &s;uch as mu&s;t have for ever annihilated the
power of France, and de&s;troyed the ballance of Europe. He required, that that
monarch &s;hould re&s;tore to him the dutchy of Burgundy, u&s;urped, as he
pretended, by Lewis the eleventh upon his ance&s;tors; that he &s;hould yield
Provence and Dauphiny to the duke of Bourbon, to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by him in
full &s;overeignty, without fief or homage to the crown of France; that he
&s;hould &s;atisfy the King of England with regard to the provinces, which that
prince claimed as his inheritance; and that he &s;hould re|nounce all title to
Naples, Milan, Genoa, or any territory in Italy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE demands were propo&s;ed to Francis, &s;oon after the
battle of Pavia, while he was detained in Pizzighitone; and as he had hitherto
tru&s;ted &s;omewhat to the emperor's genero&s;ity, the di&s;appointment
excited in his brea&s;t the mo&s;t lively indignation. He &s;aid, that he would
rather live and die a pri&s;oner than agree to di&s;member, his kingdom; and
that, even were he &s;o ba&s;e as to &s;ubmit to &s;uch terms, his &s;ubjects
would never permit him to carry them into execution. The offers which he made
for obtaining his liberty, were, that he would renounce all claims in Italy,
that he would a&s;&s;i&s;t the emperor in recovering the territories u&s;urped
upon the empire by the Venetians, that he &s;hould relinqui&s;h the homage due
by the emperor for Artois and Flanders, that he would marry Eleonora, the
emperor's &s;i&s;ter, (for he was now a widower) and acknowledge the dutchy of
Burgundy to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as her dowry; and to be inherited by her
children<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De Vera Hi&s;t. de Charles
V.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FRANCIS was encouraged to per&s;i&s;t in the&s;e offers, by the
favourable accounts, which he heard of Henry's di&s;po&s;itions towards him,
and of the alarms which had &s;eized all the chief powers in Italy, upon his
defeat and captivity. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Francis re|moved to Madrid.</NOTE> He was
unea&s;y, however, to be &s;o far di&s;tant from the emperor with whom he
mu&s;t treat; and he de&s;ired to be removed to Madrid, in hopes that a
per&s;onal interview would operate much in his favour, and that Charles, if not
influenced by his mini&s;ters, <PB N="142" REF="147"> might be found
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame frankne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition; by which he
him|&s;elf was di&s;tingui&s;hed. He was &s;oon convinced of his mi&s;take. The
emperor, under pretence of an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates at Toledo, kept,
during &s;ome time, at a di&s;tance from him; and even after they broke up,
delayed his vi&s;it to the captive King; feigning a del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cacy in that particular, as if his company, in the
pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, before any terms were agreed on, would be
regarded as an in&s;ult upon the royal pri&s;oner. Francis, partly from want of
exerci&s;e, partly from reflections on his pre&s;ent melancholy &s;ituation,
fell into a langui&s;hing illne&s;s; which begot apprehen&s;ions in Charles,
left the death of his captive &s;hould bereave him of all tho&s;e advantages,
which he propo&s;ed to extort from him. He then paid him a vi&s;it in the
ca&s;tle of Madrid; and as he approached the bed in which Francis was laid, the
&s;ick monarch called to him, 
<Q REND="inline">"You come, Sir, to vi&s;it your pri&s;oner."</Q>

<Q REND="inline"> "No," replied the emperor, "I come to vi&s;it
my brother, and my friend, who &s;hall &s;oon obtain his liberty."</Q> He
&s;oothed his affliction with many &s;peeches of a like nature, which had &s;o
good an effect, that the King daily recovered<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">bert, De V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ra, Sandoval.</NOTE>; and thenceforth
employed him&s;elf in concert|ing with the mini&s;ters of the emperor, the
terms of his treaty.</P>
<P>WHILE this negociation advanced &s;lowly, fortune threw into the
emperor's hands a new opportunity of aggrandizing his dominions in Italy.
Francis Sforza, impatient that his inve&s;titure of Milan &s;hould &s;o long be
delayed, and that even after it was granted, it &s;hould be encumbered with
many exorbitant conditions, had endeavoured to &s;educe Pe&s;cara, the imperial
general, from his fidelity, and to engage him in a con&s;piracy again&s;t his
ma&s;ter. Pe&s;cara feigned to enter into the de&s;ign; but having revealed the
whole contrivance, he received orders to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
Milane&s;e; and Charles made no &s;ecret of his intention to try Sforza and
forfeit his fief, on account of the trea&s;on, which he had committed again&s;t
his liege-lord and &s;overeign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ni, lib. 16.</NOTE>. This incident
retained the Italian powers in clo&s;er union with France; and the emperor, by
gra&s;ping too much, found him&s;elf in danger of lo&s;ing all his advantages.
His apprehen&s;ions were in|crea&s;ed, when he heard, that Francis had &s;ent a
re&s;ignation of his crown to the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, and had de&s;ired that the dauphin might be crowned King;
orders, which, tho' they were not obeyed, &s;hewed his determined re&s;olution
never to &s;ubmit to the unrea&s;onable t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rms required of him. The chief difficulty of the treaty was now
reduced to the dutchy of Burgundy; and even that territory, Francis had agreed
to yield, but he &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on fir&s;t recovering his liberty. All
mutual confidence was lo&s;t between the princes; and each feared, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t ad|vantage <PB N="143" REF="148">
&s;hould be taken of his &s;implicity, &s;hould he fir&s;t execute his part of
the treaty.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1526" UNIT="year"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 January.</NOTE> AT la&s;t the emperor was
willing to relax of his rigour in this particular; and the treaty of Madrid was
&s;igned, by which, it was hoped, an end would be fi|nally put to the
differences between the&s;e two great monarchs. The principal con|dition was
the re&s;toring of Francis's liberty, and the delivery of his two elde&s;t
&s;ons as ho&s;tages to the emperor for the re&s;titution of Burgundy: If any
difficulty &s;hould afterwards occur in the execution of this article, with
regard to Burgundy, from the oppo&s;ition of the &s;tates, either of France or
of that pro|vince, Francis &s;tipulated, that in &s;ix weeks time, he &s;hould
return to his pri&s;on, and remain there till the full performance of the
treaty. There were many other articles in this famous convention, all of them
rigorous and &s;evere to the la&s;t de|gree again&s;t the captive monarch; and
Charles di&s;covered evidently his intention of reducing Italy, as well as
France, to &s;ubjection and dependence.</P>
<P>MANY of Charles's mini&s;ters fore&s;aw, that Francis, however
&s;olemn the oaths, promi&s;es, and prote&s;tations exacted of him, never would
execute a treaty, which was &s;o di&s;advantageous, or rat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er ruinous and de&s;tructive, to him&s;elf, his
po&s;te|rity, and his country. By putting Burgundy into the emperor's hands, he
gave his powerful enemy an entrance into the heart of the kingdom: By
&s;acrificing his allies in Italy, he deprived him&s;elf of all foreign
a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and arming his oppre&s;&s;or with the whole force and riches
of that opulent country, rendered him ab&s;olutely irre&s;i&s;table. To the&s;e
great views of intere&s;t, were added the motives, no le&s;s cogent, of
pa&s;&s;ion and re&s;entment; while Francis, a prince, who piqued him&s;elf on
genero&s;ity, reflected on the rigor with which he had been treated dur|ing his
captivity, and the cruel terms which had been exacted of him for the re|covery
of his freedom. It was al&s;o fore&s;een, that the emulation and rival&s;hip,
which had &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the&s;e two monarchs, would make
him feel the &s;tronge&s;t reluctance on yielding the &s;uperiority to an
antagoni&s;t, who, by the whole tenor of his conduct, he would be apt to think,
had &s;hown him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o little
worthy of that advantage, which fortune, and fortune alone, had put into his
hands. His mini&s;ters, his friends, his &s;ubjects, his allies, with one
voice, would be &s;ure to &s;ugge&s;t to him, that the fir&s;t object of a
prince, was the pre|&s;ervation of his people; and that the laws of honour,
which with a private man ought to be ab&s;olutely &s;upreme, and &s;uperior to
all intere&s;ts, were with a &s;overeign &s;ubordinate to the great duty of
en&s;uring the &s;afety of his country. Nor could it be imagined, that Francis
would be &s;o romantic in his principles, as not to hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ken to a ca&s;ui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ry, which was &s;o plau&s;ible in it&s;elf, and which &s;o much
flat|tered <PB N="144" REF="149"> all the pa&s;&s;ions, by which, both as a
prince and a man, he was &s;trongly ac|tuated.</P>
<P>SUCH was the rea&s;oning of &s;everal of Charles's mini&s;ters,
particularly of Gat|tinara, his chancellor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 16.</NOTE>, who coun&s;elled him to treat
Francis with more gene|ro&s;ity, and to give him his liberty on &s;uch terms,
as would engage him, not by the feeble band of treaties, but by the more
forcible tye of honour, to a &s;trict and faithful performance. But the
emperor's avidity prevented him from following this wi&s;er and more honourable
council; at the &s;ame time, that the pro&s;pect of a general combination of
Europe hindered him from detaining Francis in captivity, and taking advantage
of the confu&s;ions, which his ab&s;ence mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily oc|ca&s;ion in
his kingdom. Still &s;u&s;picious, however, of the &s;incerity of his
pri&s;oner, he took an opportunity, before they parted, of a&s;king him,
privately and as a friend, whether he &s;eriou&s;ly intended to execute the
treaty of Madrid; prote&s;t|ing, that, in all ca&s;es, he was firmly determined
to re&s;tore him to his liberty, and that the pro&s;pect of obtaining this
advantage needed no longer engage him to di&s;&s;emble. Francis was too well
acquainted with Charles's character to tru&s;t to the &s;incerity of this
prote&s;tation; and therefore renewed his a&s;&s;urances of fide|lity, and a
&s;trict ob&s;ervance of his word. The emperor replied, that Francis was now
his be&s;t friend and ally; but if he &s;hould afterwards break his
engage|ments, which he could not &s;u&s;pect, he &s;hould think him&s;elf
entitled to reproach him with a conduct &s;o ba&s;e and unworthy: And on
the&s;e terms the two monarchs parted.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Francis re|covers his liberty.</NOTE> FRANCIS,
on entering into his own dominions, delivered his two elde&s;t &s;ons as

cried aloud &s;everal times, <HI>I am yet a King.</HI> He &s;oon reached
Bayonne, where he was joyfully received by the regent and his whole court. He

<P>THE pope, the Venetians, and other Italian &s;tates, who were
deeply intere&s;ted in the&s;e events, had been held in the mo&s;t anxious
&s;u&s;pence with regard to the re&s;olutions, which Francis &s;hould take,
after the recovery of his liberty; and Clement, who &s;u&s;pected, that that
prince would never execute a treaty &s;o hurtful to his intere&s;ts, and even
de&s;tructive of his independancy, had very frankly of|fered him a
di&s;pen&s;ation from all his oaths and engagements. Francis remained not in
&s;u&s;pence; but entered immediately into the confederacy propo&s;ed to him.
It was &s;tipulated, between that King, the pope, the Venetians, the Swi&s;s,
the Florentines, the duke of Milan, among other articles, that they would
oblige the emperor to deliver up the two young princes of France on receiving a
&s;uitable &s;um of money; and that he would re&s;tore Milan to Sforza, without
farther con|ditions or incumbrances. The King of England was invited to accede,
not only as a contracting party, but al&s;o as protector of the holy league,
&s;o it was called: And if Naples &s;hould be conquered from the emperor, in
pro&s;ecution of this confederacy, it was agreed, that Henry &s;hould enjoy a
principality of the yearly revenue of 30,000 ducats: And that cardinal
Wol&s;ey, in con&s;ideration of the &s;ervices, which he had rendered to
chri&s;tendom, &s;hould al&s;o, in &s;uch an event, be put in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a yearly revenue of 10,000 ducats.</P>
<P>FRANCIS was extremely de&s;irous, that the appearance of this
great confederacy &s;hould engage the emperor to relax &s;omewhat of the
extreme rigour of the treaty of Madrid; and while he entertained the&s;e hopes,
he was the more remi&s;s in his warlike preparations, nor did he &s;end in due
time reinforcements to his allies in Italy. <MILESTONE N="1527" UNIT="year">
Bourbon had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole Milane&s;e, of which the
emperor intended to grant him the inve&s;titure; and having levied a
con&s;iderable army in Germany, he became formidable to all the Italian
potentates; and not the le&s;s &s;o, that Charles, de&s;titute of money, had
not been able to remit any pay to the forces. The general was extremely beloved
by his troops; and in order to pre|vent tho&s;e mutinies which were ready to
break out every moment, and which their affection alone for him had hitherto
re&s;trained, he led them to Rome, and promi&s;ed to enrich them by the plunder
of that opulent city. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th May.</NOTE> He was him&s;elf killed, as he
was planting a ladder to &s;cale the walls; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sack of Rome.</NOTE> but his &s;oldiers,
rather enraged than di&s;couraged by his death, mounted to the a&s;&s;ault with
the utmo&s;t valour, and entering the city, &s;word in hand, exerci&s;ed all
tho&s;e brutalities, <PB N="146" REF="151"> which may be expected from ferocity
excited by re&s;i&s;tance, and from in&s;olence which takes place when that
re&s;i&s;tance is no more. That renowned city, expo&s;ed by her renown alone to
&s;o many calamities, never endured in any age, even from the barbarians, by
whom &s;he was often &s;ubdued, &s;uch indignities as &s;he was now
con&s;trained to &s;uffer. The unre&s;trained ma&s;&s;acre and pillage, which
continued for &s;everal days, were the lea&s;t ills, to which the unhappy
Romans were ex|po&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardiani, lib. 18. Bellay.

Virgins &s;uffered violation in the arms of their parents, and upon tho&s;e
very altars, to which they had fled for protection. Aged prelates, after
enduring every indignity, and even every torture, were thrown into dungeons,
and menaced each moment with the mo&s;t cruel death, in order to engage them to
reveal their &s;ecret trea&s;ures, or purcha&s;e liberty by exorbitant
ran&s;oms. Clement him&s;elf, who had tru&s;ted for protection to the
&s;acredne&s;s of his character, and neglected to make his e&s;cape in time,
was taken captive, and found that his dignity, which procured him no regard
from the Spani&s;h &s;oldiers, did but draw on him the in&s;olent moquery of
the German, who, being generally attached to the Lutheran principles, were
plea&s;ed to gratify their animo&s;ity by the aba&s;ement of the &s;overeign
pontiff.</P>
<P>WHEN intelligence of this great event was conveyed to the
emperor, that young prince, habituated to hypocri&s;y, expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t
profound &s;orrow for the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his arms: He put him&s;elf and all
his court into mourning: He &s;topped the rejoicings for the birth of his &s;on
Philip: And knowing that every artifice, however gro&s;s, is able, when
&s;econded by authority, to impo&s;e upon the people, he ordered prayers,
during &s;everal months, to be put up in all the churches for the Pope's
liberty; an event, which, all men knew, a letter under his hand could in a
moment have procured.</P>
<P>THE concern, expre&s;&s;ed by Henry and Francis for the calamity
of their ally, was much more &s;incere. The&s;e two monarchs, a few days before
the &s;ack of Rome, had concluded a treaty<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">30th
April.</NOTE>at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in which, be&s;ides renewing former alliances,
they agreed to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to Charles, requiring him to accept of
two millions of crowns as the ran&s;om of the French princes, and to repay the
money, borrowed of Henry; and in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, the amba&s;&s;adors,
attended with heralds, were to denounce war again&s;t him. This war, it was
agreed to pro&s;ecute in the Low Countries, with an army of thirty thou&s;and
in|fantry and fifteen hundred men at arms, two thirds to be &s;upplied by
Francis, the re&s;t by Henry. And in order to &s;trengthen the alliance between
the princes, it was &s;tipulated, that either Francis or his &s;on, the duke of
Orleans, as &s;hould <PB N="147" REF="152"> afterwards be agreed on, &s;hould
e&s;pou&s;e the prince&s;s Mary, Henry's daughter. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> No &s;ooner did the monarchs
receive intelligence of Bourbon's enterprize, than they changed, by a new
treaty, the &s;cene of the projected war from the Netherlands to Italy; and
hearing of the pope's captivity, they were farther &s;timulated to undertake
the war with vigour for the re&s;toring his liberty. Wol&s;ey him&s;elf
cro&s;&s;ed the &s;eas, in order to have an interview with Francis, and to
concert mea&s;ures for that purpo&s;e; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th July.</NOTE> and he di&s;played all that
grandeur and magnificence, with which he was intoxicated. He was attended with
a train of a thou&s;and hor&s;e. The cardinal of Lorraine, and the chancellor
Alan&ccedil;on, met him at Bou|logne: Francis him&s;elf, be&s;ides granting to
that haughty prelate the power of giving in every place, where he came, liberty
to all pri&s;oners, made a journey as far as Amiens to meet him, and even
advanced &s;ome miles from the town, the more to honour his reception. It was
here &s;tipulated, that the duke of Orleans &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the prince&s;s
Mary; and as the emperor &s;eemed to be taking &s;ome &s;teps towards
a&s;&s;embling a general council, the two monarchs agreed not to acknow|ledge
it, but, during the interval of the pope's captivity, to govern the churches in
their dominions, each by his own authority. Wol&s;ey made &s;ome attempts to
get his legantine power extended into France, and even into Germany; but
find|ing his efforts fruitle&s;s, he was obliged, tho' with great reluctance,
to de&s;i&s;t from the&s;e ambitious enterprizes<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, book 3. coll. 12, 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">18th Septem|ber.</NOTE> THE more to cement
the union between the&s;e princes, a new treaty was, &s;ome time after,
concluded at London; in which Henry agreed to renounce for ever all claims upon
the crown of France; claims, which might now indeed be e&s;teemed chimerical,
but which often &s;erved as a pretence for exciting the un|wary Engli&s;h to
wage war upon the French monarchy. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">League with France.</NOTE> As a return for
this conce&s;&s;ion, Francis bound him&s;elf and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to pay
for ever fifty thou&s;and crowns a year to Henry and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; and
that a greater &s;olemnity might be given to this treaty, it was agreed, that
the Parliaments and great nobility of both kingdoms &s;hould give their
con&s;ent to it. The mare&s;chal Montmorency, accompanied with many per&s;ons
of di&s;tinction, and attended by a pompous equi|page, was &s;ent over to
ratify the treaty; and was received at London with all the parade, which
&s;uited the &s;olemnity of the occa&s;ion. The terror of the emperor's
greatne&s;s had entirely extingui&s;hed the antient animo&s;ity between the
nations; and Spain, during more than a century, became, tho' a more di&s;tant
power, the chief object of jealou&s;y to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>THIS appearance of a cordial union between France and England,
tho' it added influence to the joint emba&s;&s;y which they &s;ent to the
emperor, was not <PB N="148" REF="153"> able to bend that ambitious monarch to
&s;ubmit entirely to the conditions in&s;i&s;ted on by the allies. He departed
indeed from his demand of Burgundy as the ran&s;om of the French princes; but
he required, previou&s;ly to their recovery of liberty, that Francis &s;hould
evacuate Genoa, and all the fortre&s;&s;es held by him in Italy: And he
declared his intention of bringing Sforza to a trial, and confi&s;cating the
dutchy of Milan, on account of his pretended trea&s;on. The Engli&s;h and
French he|ralds, therefore, according to agreement, declared war again&s;t him,
and &s;et him at defiance. Charles an&s;wered the Engli&s;h herald with
moderation; but to the French, he reproached his ma&s;ter with breach of faith,
remembered him of the private conver&s;ation which had pa&s;&s;ed between them
at Madrid before their &s;e|paration, and offered to prove by &s;ingle combat,
that that monarch had acted di&s;honourably. Francis retaliated this challenge
by giving Charles the lie; and, after demanding &s;ecurity of the field, he
offered to maintain his cau&s;e by &s;ingle combat. Many me&s;&s;ages
pa&s;&s;ed to and fro between them; but tho' both the princes were undoubtedly
brave, the intended duel never took place. The French and Spaniards, during
that age, di&s;puted zealou&s;ly which of the monarchs incurred the blame of
this failure; but all men of moderation every where la|mented the power of
fortune, that the prince the more candid, generous, and &s;incere, &s;hould, by
unhappy incidents, have been reduced to that cruel &s;ituation, that nothing
but the breach of his word could pre&s;erve his people, and that he mu&s;t ever
after, without being able to make a proper reply, bear to be reproached with
this infidelity by a rival, inferior to him both in honour and in virtue.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this famous challenge between Charles and Francis had
no imme|diate con&s;equences with regard to the&s;e monarchs them&s;elves, it
produced a con|&s;iderable alteration on the manners of the age. The practice
of challenges and duels, which had been part of the antient barbarous
juri&s;prudence, which was &s;till pre&s;erved on very &s;olemn occa&s;ions,
and which was even countenanced by the civil magi&s;trate, began thenceforth to
prevail on the mo&s;t trivial occa&s;ions; and men, on any affront or injury,
thought them&s;elves entitled, or even required in honour, to take private
revenges on their enemies, by vindicating their right in &s;ingle combat.
The&s;e ab&s;urd, tho' generous maxims, &s;hed much of the be&s;t blood in
chri&s;tendom during more than two centuries; and notwith&s;tanding the
&s;everity of law, &s;uch is the prevailing force of cu&s;tom, they are far
from being as yet en|tirely exploded.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scruples con|cerning the King's
mar|riage.</NOTE> NOtwith&s;tanding the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive deference, paid to the
papal authority be|fore the reformation, the marriage of Henry the eighth with
Catherine of Arragon, his brother's widow, had not pa&s;&s;ed, without much
&s;cruple and difficulty. The prejudices of the people were in general bent
again&s;t a conjugal union between &s;uch near relations; and the late King,
tho' he had &s;olemnized the e&s;pou&s;als, when his &s;on was but twelve years
of age, gave evident proofs of his intention to take afterwards a proper
opportunity of annulling them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mori&s;on's Apomaxis, p.
13.</NOTE>. He ordered the young prince, &s;o &s;oon as he came of age, to
enter a prote&s;tation again&s;t the marriage<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mori&s;on, p. 13. Heylin's Queen Mary, p. 2.</NOTE>; and on his
death-bed he charged him, as his la&s;t injunc|tion, not to fini&s;h an
alliance, &s;o unu&s;ual and expo&s;ed to &s;uch in&s;uperable ob|jections.
After the King's acce&s;&s;ion, &s;ome members of the Privy Council,
par|ticularly Warham, the primate, openly declared again&s;t the re&s;olution
taken, of compleating the marriage; and tho' Henry's youth and di&s;&s;ipation
kept him, during &s;ome time, from entertaining any &s;cruples with regard to
the mea&s;ure which he had embraced, there happened incidents, &s;ufficient to
rouze his at|tention, and to inform him of the &s;entiments, generally
entertained on that &s;ub|ject. The &s;tates of Ca&s;tile had oppo&s;ed the
emperor, Charles's, e&s;pou&s;als with Mary, Henry's daughter; and among other
objections, had much in&s;i&s;ted on the illegitimate birth of the young
prince&s;s<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert, Fiddes's life of
Wol&s;ey.</NOTE>. And when the negotiations were afterwards opened with France,
and mention was made of betrothing her to Francis or the duke of Orleans, the
bi&s;hop of Tarbe, the French amba&s;&s;ador, <PB N="150" REF="155"> revived
the &s;ame objection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIV. 192, 203. Heylin, p.
3.</NOTE>. But tho' the&s;e events naturally rai&s;ed &s;ome doubts in Henry's
mind, there concurred other cau&s;es, which tended much to fortify his
remor&s;e, and render his con&s;cience more &s;crupulous.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King en|ters into the&s;e
&s;cruples.</NOTE> THE queen was older than the King by no le&s;s than &s;ix
years; and the decay of her beauty, together with particular infirmities and
di&s;ea&s;es, had contributed, notwith&s;tanding her blamele&s;s character and
deportment, to render her per&s;on unacceptable to him. Tho' &s;he had borne
him &s;everal children, they all died in early infancy, except one daughter;
and he was the more &s;truck with this mi&s;|fortune, that the cur&s;e of being
childle&s;s is the very threatening, contained in the Mo&s;aical law again&s;t
tho&s;e who e&s;pou&s;e their brother's widow. The King was actuated by a
&s;trong de&s;ire of having male i&s;&s;ue: With a view to that end, it is
believed, more than from de&s;ire towards other gratification, he had, a few
years before this period, made addre&s;&s;es to a young lady, Catherine,
daughter of Sir John Blount; and when &s;he bore him a &s;on, he expre&s;&s;ed
the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction, and immediately created him duke of Richmond. The
&s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of the crown too was a con&s;ideration, that occurred to
every one, when|ever the lawfulne&s;s of Henry's marriage was que&s;tioned; and
it was apprehended, that, if doubts of Mary's legitimacy concurred with the
weakne&s;s of her &s;ex, the King of Scots, the next heir, would certainly
advance his own preten&s;ions, and throw the kingdom into confu&s;ion. The
evils, as yet recent, of civil wars and convul&s;ions, ari&s;ing from a
di&s;puted title, made great impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of men, and rendered
the people univer&s;ally de&s;irous of any event, which might obvi|ate &s;o
irreparable a calamity. And the King was thus impelled, both by his private
pa&s;&s;ions, and by motives of public intere&s;t, to &s;eek the
di&s;&s;olution of his inau&s;picious, and, as it was e&s;teemed, unlawful
marriage with Catherine.</P>
<P>HENRY afterwards affirmed, that his &s;cruples of con&s;cience
aro&s;e entirely from private reflection; and that on con&s;ulting his
confe&s;&s;or, the bi&s;hop of Lincoln, he found that prelate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
with the &s;ame doubts and difficulties. The King him&s;elf, being &s;o great a
ca&s;ui&s;t and a divine, proceeded then to examine the que&s;tion more
carefully by his own learning and &s;tudy; and having had recour&s;e to Thomas
of Aquine, he ob&s;erved that this celebrated doctor, who&s;e authority was
great in the church and ab&s;olute with him, had treated of that very ca&s;e,
and had expre&s;sly declared again&s;t the lawfulne&s;s of &s;uch
marriages<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Fiddes.</NOTE>. The
pro|hibitions, &s;aid Thomas, contained in Leviticus, and among the re&s;t,
that of marrying a brother's widow, are moral, eternal, and founded on a divine
&s;anction; and tho' the pope may di&s;pen&s;e with the rules of the church,
the laws of God cannot be &s;et a&s;ide by any authority le&s;s than that which
enacted them. The <PB N="151" REF="156"> archbi&s;hop of Canterbury was next
applied to; and he was required to con&s;ult his brethren: All the prelates of
England, except Fi&s;her, bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, declared unanimou&s;ly,
under their hand and &s;eal, that they deemed the King's marriage unlawful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 38. Stowe, p. 548.</NOTE>. Wol&s;ey
al&s;o fortified the King's &s;cruples<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le Grand,
vol. 3. p. 46, 166, 168. Saunders. Heylin, p. 4.</NOTE>, partly with a view of
promoting a total breach with the emperor, Catherine's nephew, partly
de&s;irous of connecting the King more clo&s;ely with Francis, by marrying him
to the dutche&s;s of Alen&ccedil;on, &s;i&s;ter to that monarch; and perhaps
too &s;omewhat di&s;gu&s;ted with the queen her&s;elf, who had reproved him for
certain freedoms, unbefitting his character and &s;tation<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 38. Strype, vol. 1. p. 88.</NOTE>. But Henry
was carried forward, tho' per|haps not at fir&s;t excited, by a motive more
forcible than even the &s;ugge&s;tions of that powerful favourite.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Anne Boleyn.</NOTE> ANNE Boleyn, who lately
appeared at court, had been created maid of honour to the queen; and having had
frequent opportunities of being &s;een by the King, and of conver&s;ing with
him, &s;he had acquired an entire a&s;cendant over his affections. This young
lady, who&s;e grandeur and misfortunes have rendered her &s;o celebrated, was
daughter to Sir Thomas Boleyn, who had been employed by the King in &s;everal
emba&s;&s;ies, and who was allied to all the principal nobility of the kingdom.
His wife, mother to Anne, was daughter of the duke of Norfolk; his own mother
was daughter of the earl of Ormond; his grandfather Sir Geoffrey Boleyn, who
had been mayor of London, had e&s;pou&s;ed one of the daughters and co-heirs of
the lord Ha&s;tings<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Camden's preface to the life
of Elizabeth. Burnet, vol. 1. p. 44.</NOTE>. Anne her&s;elf, tho' then in very
early youth, had been carried over to Paris by the King's &s;i&s;ter, when
&s;he e&s;pou&s;ed Lewis the twelfth of France; and upon the decea&s;e of that
monarch, and the return of his dowager into England, Anne, who&s;e
accompli&s;hments even in her tender years were always much admired, was
retained in the &s;ervice of Claude, queen of France, &s;pou&s;e to Francis;
and after her death, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed into the family of the dutche&s;s of
Alan&ccedil;on, a prince&s;s of &s;ingular merit. The exact time, when &s;he
returned to England, is not certainly known; but it was after the King had
entertained doubts with regard to the lawfulne&s;s of his mar|riage with
Catherine; if the account is to be credited, which he him&s;elf after|wards
gave of that tran&s;action. Henry's &s;cruples had made him break off all
conjugal commerce with the queen; but as he &s;till &s;upported an
intercour&s;e of civility and freind&s;hip with her, he had occa&s;ion, in the
vi&s;its, which he paid her, to ob&s;erve the beauty, the youth, the charms of
Anne Boleyn. Find|ing the accompli&s;hments of her mind no way inferior to her
exterior graces, he <PB N="152" REF="157"> even entertained the de&s;ign of
rai&s;ing her to the throne; and was the more con|firmed in this re&s;olution,
when he found that her virtue and mode&s;ty prevented all hopes of gratifying
his pa&s;&s;ion after any other manner. And as every motive of inclination and
policy, &s;eemed thus to concur in making the King de&s;irous of a divorce from
Catherine, and as his pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s was inviting, he re&s;olved to
make applications to Clement, and he &s;ent Knight, his &s;ecretary, to Rome
for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry applies to the pope for a
divorce.</NOTE> THAT he might not &s;hock the haughty claims of the pontiff, it
was re&s;olved not to found the application on any general doubts of the papal
power to per|mit marriage in the nearer degrees of con&s;anguinity; but only to
in&s;i&s;t on parti|cular grounds of invalidity in the bull, which Julius had
granted for the mar|riage of Henry and Catherine. It was a maxim in the court
of Rome, that, if the pope be &s;urprized into any conce&s;&s;ion, or grant any
indulgence upon fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, the bull may afterwards be annulled;
and this pretence had u&s;ually been employed, wherever one pope had recalled
any deed, executed by any of his predece&s;&s;ors. But Julius's bull, when
examined, afforded plentiful matter of this kind; and any tribunal, favourable
to Henry, needed not want a &s;pecious colour for gratifying him in his
applications for a divorce. It was &s;aid in the preamble, that the bull had
been granted upon his &s;ollicitation; tho' it was known, that, at that time,
he was below twelve years of age: It was al&s;o affirmed, as another motive for
the bull, that the marriage was requi&s;ite, in order to pre&s;erve peace
between the two crowns; tho' it is certain, that there was not then any ground
or appearance of quarrel between them. The&s;e fal&s;e premi&s;es in Julius's
bull, &s;eemed to afford Clement a &s;ufficient rea&s;on or pretence for
annulling it, and granting Henry a di&s;pen&s;ation for a &s;econd
marriage<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Collier, Eccle&s;. Hi&s;t. vol. II. p.
25. from the Cott. Lib. Vitell. B. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pope favourable.</NOTE> BUT tho' the
pretext for this indulgence had been le&s;s plau&s;ible, the pope was in &s;uch
a &s;ituation, that he had the &s;tronge&s;t motive to embrace every
oppor|tunity of gratifying the Engli&s;h monarch. He was then a pri&s;oner in
the hands of the emperor, and had no hopes of recovering his liberty on any
rea&s;onable terms, unle&s;s by the efforts of the league, which Henry had
formed with Fran|cis and the Italian powers, in order to oppo&s;e the
exorbitant ambition of Charles. When the Engli&s;h Secretary, therefore, made
private applications to him, he received a very favourable an&s;wer; and a
di&s;pen&s;ation was forthwith promi&s;ed to be expeded to his ma&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 47.</NOTE>. Soon after, the march of a
French army into Ita|ly, under the command of Lautrec, obliged the
imperiali&s;ts to give Clement his liberty; and he retired to Orvietto, where
the Secretary, with Sir Gregory Cu&s;|&s;ali, the King's re&s;ident at Rome,
renewed their applications to him. They <PB N="153" REF="158"> found him
&s;till full of high profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, gratitude, and attachment
to the King; but not &s;o expeditious in granting his reque&s;t as they
expected. The emperor, who had got intelligence of Henry's application to Rome,
had exacted a promi&s;e of the pope, to take no &s;teps in that affair before
he com|municated them to the imperial mini&s;ters; and Clement, confined by
this pro|mi&s;e, and &s;till more overawed by the emperor's forces in Italy,
&s;eemed willing to po&s;tpone tho&s;e conce&s;&s;ions de&s;ired of him by
Henry. Importuned, however, by the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters, he at la&s;t put into
their hands a <HI>commi&s;&s;ion</HI> to Wol&s;ey, as legate, in conjunction
with the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, or any other Eng|li&s;h prelate, to
examine the validity of the King's marriage, and of Julius's

he conjured them not to publi&s;h tho&s;e papers, or make any further u&s;e of

<P><MILESTONE N="1528" UNIT="year"> WHEN Henry received the
commi&s;&s;ion and di&s;pen&s;ation from his amba&s;&s;adors, and was informed
of the pope's advice, he laid the whole matter before his mi|ni&s;ters, and
a&s;ked their opinion in &s;o delicate a &s;ituation. The Engli&s;h
coun&s;el|lors con&s;idered the danger of proceeding in the manner pointed out
to them. Should the pope refu&s;e to confirm a deed, which he might ju&s;tly
call precipitate and irregular, and &s;hould he di&s;avow the advice which he
gave in &s;o clande&s;tine a manner, the King would find his &s;econd marriage
totally invalidated; any chil|dren, which it might bring him, declared
illegitimate; and his marriage with Catherine more firmly rivetted than
ever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 51.</NOTE>. And Henry's
apprehen&s;ions of the po&s;|&s;ibility, or even probability, of &s;uch an
event, were much confirmed, when he reflected on the character and &s;ituation
of the &s;overeign pontiff.</P>
<P>CLEMENT the &s;eventh was a prince of excellent judgment,
whenever his timi|dity, to which he was extremely &s;ubject, allowed him to
make full u&s;e of tho&s;e <PB N="154" REF="159"> talents, and that
penetration, with which he was endowed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul,
lib. 1&punc; Guicciardini.</NOTE>. The captivity, and other misfortunes, which
he had undergone, by entering into a league again&s;t Charles, had &s;o
affected his imagination, that he never afterwards exerted him&s;elf with
vigour in any public mea&s;ures, e&s;pecially if the intere&s;ts or
inclinations of that potentate &s;tood in oppo&s;ition to him. The imperial
forces were, at pre&s;ent, powerful in Italy, and might return to the attack of
Rome, which was &s;till de|fencele&s;s, and expo&s;ed to the &s;ame calamities
with which it had already been over|whelmed. And be&s;ides the&s;e dangers,
Clement found or fancied him&s;elf expo&s;ed to perils, which threatned,
&s;till more immediately, his per&s;on and dignity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The emperor threatens him.</NOTE> CHARLES,
apprized of the timid di&s;po&s;ition of the holy father, threw out perpetual
menaces of &s;ummoning a general council; which, he repre&s;ent|ed, as
nece&s;&s;ary to reform the church, and correct tho&s;e exorbitant abu&s;es,
which the ambition and avarice of the court of Rome had introduced into every
branch of eccle&s;ia&s;tical admini&s;tration. The power of Clement him&s;elf,
he &s;aid, the &s;overeign pontiff, required limitation; his conduct called
aloud for amend|ment; and even his title to the throne, which he filled, might
ju&s;tly be brought in que&s;tion. That pope had always pa&s;&s;ed for the
natural &s;on of Julian of Me|dici, who was of the &s;overeign family of
Florence; and tho' Leo the tenth, his cou&s;in, had declared him legitimate,
upon a pretended promi&s;e of marriage be|tween his father and mother, few
per&s;ons believed that declaration to be founded on any ju&s;t rea&s;on or
authority<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>. The canon
law, indeed, had been entirely &s;ilent with regard to the promotion of
ba&s;tards to the papal throne; but, what was &s;till dangerous, the people had
entertained a violent prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that that &s;tain in the birth of
any per&s;on was &s;ufficient to incapacitate him for &s;o holy an office. And
in another point, the canon law was expre&s;s and po&s;itive, that no man,
guilty of &s;imony, could attain that dignity. A &s;evere bull of Julius the
&s;econd had added new &s;anctions to this law, by declaring, that a
&s;imoniacal elec|tion &s;hould not be rendered valid, even by a po&s;terior
con&s;ent of the cardinals. But unfortunately Clement had given to cardinal
Colonna a billet, containing promi&s;es of advancing that cardinal, in ca&s;e
he him&s;elf &s;hould attain the papal dignity by his concurrence: And this
billet, Colonna, who was in entire de|pendance on the emperor, threatned every
moment to expo&s;e to public view<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE Charles terrified the pope with the&s;e menaces, he al&s;o
allured him by hopes, which were no le&s;s prevalent over his affections. At
the time that the em|peror's forces &s;acked Rome, and reduced Clement to
captivity, the Florentines, pa&s;&s;ionate for their ancient liberty, had taken
advantage of his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and re|volting <PB N="155" REF="160">
again&s;t the family of Medici, had entirely aboli&s;hed their authority in
Florence, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the former democracy. The better to protect
them|&s;elves in their freedom, they had entered into the alliance with France,
England, and Venice, again&s;t the emperor; and Clement found, that, by this
intere&s;t, the hands of his confederates were tied from a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in
the re&s;toration of his fa|mily; the event, which, of all others, he mo&s;t
pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired. The empe|ror alone, he knew, was able to effectuate
this purpo&s;e; and therefore, what|ever profe&s;&s;ions he made of fidelity to
his allies, he was always, on the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of hope, ready to embrace
every propo&s;al of a cordial reconcilement with that monarch<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Father Paul.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE views and intere&s;ts of the pope were well known in
England; and as the oppo&s;ition of the emperor was fore&s;een to Henry's
divorce, both on account of the honour and intere&s;ts of Catherine, his aunt,
and the obvious motive of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing an enemy, it was e&s;teemed
dangerous to take any mea&s;ure of con&s;e|quence, in expectation of the
&s;ub&s;equent concurrence of a man of Clement's character, who&s;e behaviour
contained always &s;o much duplicity, and who was at pre&s;ent &s;o little at
his own di&s;po&s;al. The &s;afe&s;t mea&s;ure &s;eemed to con&s;i&s;t in
pre|viou&s;ly engaging him &s;o far, that he could not afterwards recede, and
in making u&s;e of his pre&s;ent ambiguity and uncertainty, to extort the
mo&s;t important con|ce&s;&s;ions from him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 February.</NOTE> For this purpo&s;e,

not merited other treatment, than to be thus, after &s;o long a time, thrown

<P>AFTER her departure, the King did her the ju&s;tice to
acknowledge, that &s;he had ever been a dutiful and affectionate wife, and that
the whole tenor of her behaviour had been conformable to the &s;tricte&s;t

when they in&s;i&s;ted on &s;uch di&s;agreeable topics. The trial was &s;pun
out till the 23d of July; and Campeggio chiefly took on him the part of
conducting it. Wol&s;ey, tho' the elder cardinal, per|mitted him to act as

<P>DURING the time, that the trial was carried on before the

terror, which could operate either on the pa&s;&s;ion or timidity of the

the French, had been no le&s;s earne&s;t in their applications, that the
legates &s;hould be allowed to fini&s;h the trial; but, tho' they employed the
&s;ame engines of promi&s;es and menaces, the objects, which they could &s;et
before the pope, were not &s;o in&s;tant nor immediate as tho&s;e which were
held up to him by the emperor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 1. p.

&s;o con&s;iderable an acce&s;&s;ion, made &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion on Clement's
mind, in compari&s;on of the anxiety for his own per&s;onal &s;afety, and the
fond de&s;ire of re&s;toring the Medici to their dominion in Florence. So
&s;oon, therefore, as he had adju&s;ted all terms with the emperor, he laid
hold of the pretence of ju&s;tice, which required him, he &s;aid, to pay regard
to the queen's appeal; and &s;u&s;pending the commi&s;&s;ion of the legates, he
evoked the cau&s;e to Rome. The legate, Campeggio, had beforehand received
private orders, de|livered by Campana, to burn the decretal bull, with which he
was entru&s;ted.</P>
<P>WOLSEY had long fore&s;een this mea&s;ure as the &s;ure

unpro&s;perous event, which the pope's partiality had produced. But he had
&s;ufficient experience of the extreme ardour and impatience of Henry's

Anne Boleyn al&s;o, who was prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t him, had imputed to
him the failure of her hopes; and as &s;he was newly re|turned to court, whence
&s;he had been removed, from a regard to decency, during the trial before the

tended to ha&s;ten his downfal; while he imputed the bad &s;ucce&s;s of that
mini&s;ter's undertakings, not to fortune or mi&s;take, but to the ma|lignity
or infidelity of his intentions. The blow, however, fell not in&s;tantly on his

without a more expre&s;s warrant, Henry wrote him a letter, upon which it was
&s;urren|dered, and was delivered by the King to Sir Thomas More, a man, who,

<P>WOLSEY was ordered to depart from York Place, a palace which he
had built in London, and which, tho' it really belonged to the &s;ee of York,
was &s;eized by Henry, and became afterwards the re&s;idence of the Kings of
England, under the title of Whitehall. All his furniture and plate were
converted to the King's u&s;e. Their riches and &s;plendour be&s;itted rather a
royal than a private fortune. The walls of his palace were covered with cloth
of gold or cloth of &s;ilver: He had a cupboard of plate of ma&s;&s;y gold:
There were found a thou&s;and pieces of &s;ine holland belonging to him. All
the re&s;t of his riches and furniture was in pro|portion; and his opulence was
probably no &s;mall inducement to this violent per&s;ecution again&s;t him.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="166"> THE cardinal was ordered to retire to
A&s;her, a country &s;eat which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed near Hampton-Court. The
world, who had paid him &s;uch abject court during his pro&s;perity, now
entirely de&s;erted him, on this fatal rever&s;e of all his fortunes. He
him&s;elf was much dejected with the change; and from the &s;ame turn of mind,
which had made him be &s;o vainly elated with his grandeur, he felt the blow of
adver&s;ity with double rigour<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. 1.
p. 114, 115. App. N^o 31, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The &s;malle&s;t appearance of his
return to favour threw him into tran&s;ports of joy, unbecoming a man. The King
had &s;eemed willing, during &s;ome time, to intermit the blows, which
over|whelmed him. He granted him his protection, and le&s;t him in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ees of York and Winche&s;ter. He even &s;ent him a

affection. Wol&s;ey, who was on hor&s;e|back when the me&s;&s;enger met him,
immediately alighted; and throwing him&s;elf on his knees in the dirt, received
in that humble po&s;ture the&s;e marks of his maje&s;ty's gracious
di&s;po&s;ition towards him<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p.

<P>BUT his enemies, who dreaded his return to court, never cea&s;ed
plying the King with accounts of his &s;everal offences; and Anne Boleyn in
particular, who bore him no kindne&s;s, contributed her endeavours, in
conjunction with her uncle the duke of Norfolk, to exclude him from all hopes
of ever being rein&s;tated in his former authority. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
therefore his numerous retinue; and as he was a kind and beneficent ma&s;ter,
the &s;eparation pa&s;&s;ed not without a plentiful effu&s;ion of tears on both

King's heart, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome gleams of kindne&s;s, &s;eemed now
totally hardened again&s;t his old favourite. He ordered him to be indicted in
the Star Chamber, where a &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed upon him. And not contented
with this &s;everity, he abandoned him to all the rigour of the Parliament,
which now, after a long interval, was again a&s;&s;embled. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d November.</NOTE> The hou&s;e of lords voted
a long charge again&s;t Wol&s;ey, con&s;i&s;ting of forty-four articles; and
accompanied it with an application to the King for his puni&s;hment, and his
removal from all authority. Little oppo&s;ition was made to this charge in the
upper hou&s;e: No evidence of any part of it was &s;o much as called for; and
as it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of general accu&s;ations, it was &s;carce

charge again&s;t the cardinal is his procuring the legantine power, which,
however, as it was certainly done with the King's con&s;ent and permi&s;&s;ion,
could be no wi&s;e criminal. Many of the other articles al&s;o regard the mere
exerci&s;e of that power. Some articles impute to him as crimes, particular
actions, which were natural or unavoidable to any man, that was prime
mini&s;ter with &s;o unlimited an authority; &s;uch as receiving fir&s;t all

been his fellow, <HI>the King and I:</HI> It is reported that &s;ometimes he
even put his own name before the King's, <HI>ego et rex meus.</HI> But this
mode of expre&s;&s;ion is ju&s;tified by the Latin idiom. It is remarkable,
that his whi&s;pering in the King's

affected with venereal di&s;tempers, is an article again&s;t him. Many of the

affirm, that no man ever fell from &s;o high a &s;tation, who had &s;o few real

Yet the refutation of the articles by Cromwel, and their being rejected by a
hou&s;e of commons even in this arbitrary reign, is almo&s;t a demon&s;tration
of Wol&s;ey's innocence. Henry was, no doubt, entirely bent on his
de&s;truction, when, on his failure by a par|liamentary impeachment, he
attacked him upon the &s;tatute of provi&s;ors, which afforded him &s;o little
ju&s;t hold on that mini&s;ter. For that this indictment was &s;ub&s;equent to
the attack in parliament, ap|pears by Cavendi&s;h's life of Wol&s;ey, Stowe, p.

<P>WOLSEY'S enemies, finding that either his innocence or his

recour&s;e to a very ex|traordinary expedient. An indictment was lodged
again&s;t him; that, contrary to a &s;tatute of Richard the &s;econd, commonly
called the &s;tatute of provi&s;ors, he had procured bulls from Rome,

exerci&s;ed with very exten&s;ive authority. He con|fe&s;&s;ed the indictment,
pleaded ignorance of the &s;tatute, and threw him&s;elf on the King's mercy. He
was perhaps within reach of the law; but be&s;ides that this &s;tatute was
fallen altogether into di&s;u&s;e, nothing could be more rigorous and &s;evere
than to impute to him as a crime, what he had openly, during a cour&s;e of &s;o
many years, practi&s;ed with the con&s;ent and approbation of the King, and the
acquie&s;cence of the Parliament and kingdom. Not to mention, what he always
a&s;&s;erted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cavendi&s;h, page 72.</NOTE>, and what we
can &s;carce doubt of, that he had obtained the royal licence in the mo&s;t

any oppo&s;ition to Henry's lawle&s;s will, he might have pleaded in his own

<P>HENRY was not di&s;plea&s;ed, that the court of Rome and the
clergy &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible, that they were entirely dependant on him, and
that his Parliament, if he were willing to &s;econd their inclinations, were
&s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to reduce the power and privileges of the
eccle&s;ia&s;tics. The commons gratified the King in another particular of
moment: They granted him a di&s;charge of all tho&s;e debts, which he had
contracted &s;ince the beginning of his reign: And they grounded this bill,
which occa&s;ioned many complaints, on a pretence of the King's great care of
the nation, and of his employing regularly all the money, which he had
borrowed, in the public &s;ervice. Mo&s;t of the King's creditors con&s;i&s;ted
of friends to the cardinal, who had been engaged by their patron to contribute
to the &s;upply of Henry's demands; and the pre&s;ent courtiers were well
plea&s;ed to take the opportunity of mulcting them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 83.</NOTE>. Several al&s;o approved of an
expedient, which, they hoped, would ever after di&s;credit a method of
&s;upply, &s;o irregular and &s;o unparliamentary.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign affairs.</NOTE> THE dome&s;tic
tran&s;actions of England were at pre&s;ent &s;o intere&s;ting to the King,
that they chiefly engaged his attention; and he regarded foreign affairs only
in &s;ubordination to them. He had declared war again&s;t the emperor; but the
mutual advantages reaped by the commerce between England and the Ne|therlands
had engaged him to &s;tipulate a neutrality with tho&s;e provinces; and except
by money contributed to the Italian wars, he had in effect exerci&s;ed no
ho&s;tilities again&s;t any of the imperial dominions. A general peace was this
&s;um|mer e&s;tabli&s;hed in Europe. Margaret of Au&s;tria and Loui&s;e of
Savoy met at Cambray, and &s;ettled the terms of pacification between the
French King and the emperor. Charles accepted of two millions of crowns in lieu
of Burgundy; and he delivered up the two princes of France, whom he had
retained as ho&s;tages. Henry was &s;o generous to his friend and ally Francis,
that he &s;ent him an ac|quital of near 600,000 crowns, which that prince owed
him. Francis's Italian confederates were not &s;o well &s;atisfied as the King
with the peace of Cambray: They were there almo&s;t wholly abandoned to the
will of the emperor; and &s;eemed to have no other means of &s;ecurity left,
but his equity and moderation. Flo|rence, after a brave re&s;i&s;tance, was
&s;ubdued by the imperial arms, and finally deli|vered over to the dominion of
the family of Medici. The Venetians were better <PB N="165" REF="170"> treated:
They were only obliged to relinqui&s;h &s;ome acqui&s;itions, which they had
made on the coa&s;t of Naples. Even Francis S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">orza obtained the inve&s;titure of Milan, and was pardoned all his
pa&s;t offences. The emperor in per&s;on pa&s;&s;ed over into Italy with a
magnificent train, and received the imperial crown from the hands of the pope
at Bologna. He was but twenty nine years of age; and having already, by his
vigour and capacity, &s;ucceeded in every enterprize, and reduced to captivity
the two greate&s;t potentates in Europe, the one &s;piritual, the other
temporal, he attracted the eyes of all men; and many progno&s;tications were
formed of his growing empire.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Charles &s;eemed to be pro&s;perous on every &s;ide,
and the conque&s;t of Mexico and Peru now began to prevent that &s;earcity of
money, under which he had hitherto laboured, he found him&s;elf threatened with
difficulties in Germany; and his de&s;ire of remedying them was the chief
cau&s;e of his granting &s;uch mode|rate conditions to the powers in Italy.
Sultan Solyman, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t accompli&s;hed prince, that ever
&s;at on the Ottoman throne, had almo&s;t entirely &s;ubdued Hungary, had
be&s;ieged Vienna, and, tho' repul&s;ed, &s;till menaced the hereditary
dominions of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria with conque&s;t and &s;ubjection. The
Lutheran princes in the empire, finding, that liberty of con&s;cience was
denied them, had combined in a league for their own defence at Smalcalde; and
be|cau&s;e they prote&s;ted again&s;t the votes of the imperial diet, they
thenceforth re|ceived the appellation of <HI>prote&s;tants.</HI> Charles had
undertaken to reduce them to obedience; and under pretence of &s;ecuring the
purity of religion, he had laid a &s;cheme of aggrandizing his own family, by
extending its dominions over all Germany.</P>
<P>THE friend&s;hip of Henry was one material circum&s;tance yet
wanting to Charles, in order to render his ambitious projects fea&s;ible; and
the King was &s;ufficiently acquainted, that the concurrence of that prince
would at once remove all the difficulties, which lay in the way of his divorce;
that point, which had long been the object of his mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;hes.
But be&s;ides that the intere&s;ts of his kingdom &s;eemed to require a
confederacy with France, his haughty &s;pirit could not brook a friend&s;hip
impo&s;ed on him by con&s;traint; and as he had ever been accu&s;tomed to
receive court&s;hip, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ollicitation from the greate&s;t
potentates, he could ill bear that dependance, to which this unhappy affair
&s;eemed to have reduced him. Amid&s;t the anxieties with which he was
agitated, he was often tempted to break off all connexion with the court of
Rome; and tho' he had been educated in a &s;uper&s;titious reverence to the
papal authority, it is likely, that his per&s;onal experience of the duplicity
and &s;elfi&s;h politics of Cle|ment, had &s;erved much to open his eyes in
that particular. He found his royal <PB N="166" REF="171"> prerogative firmly
e&s;tabli&s;hed at home: He ob&s;erved that his people were in general much
di&s;gu&s;ted with clerical u&s;urpations, and di&s;po&s;ed to reduce the
powers and privileges of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical order: He knew, that they had
cordially taken part with him in his pro&s;ecution of a divorce, and highly
re&s;ented that un|worthy treatment, which, after &s;o many &s;ervices and
&s;uch devoted attachment, he had received from the court of Rome. Anne Boleyn
al&s;o could not fail, by her in&s;inuations, to engage him into extremities
with the pope, both as it was the readie&s;t way to her attaining royal
dignity, and as her education in the court of the dutche&s;s of Alan&ccedil;on,
a prince&s;s inclined to the reformers, had already di&s;po&s;ed her to a
belief of the new doctrines. But notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e in|ducements,
Henry had &s;trong motives &s;till to de&s;ire a good agreement with the
&s;overeign pontiff. He apprehended the danger of &s;uch great innovations: He
dreaded the reproach of here&s;y: He abhorred all connexions with the
Luthe|rans, the chief opponents of papal power: And having once exerted
him&s;elf with &s;uch applau&s;e, as he imagined, in defence of the Romi&s;h
communion, he was a&s;hamed to retract his former opinions, and betray from
pa&s;&s;ion &s;uch a palpable incon&s;i&s;tency. While he was agitated by
the&s;e contrary motives, an expedient was propo&s;ed, which, as it promi&s;ed
a &s;olution of all difficulties, was embraced by him with the greate&s;t joy
and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The univer&s;i|ties con&s;ulted about the

Cambridge, was a man remarkable in that univer&s;ity for his learning, and
&s;till more, for the candour and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of his temper. He
fell one evening by accident into com|pany with Gardiner, now &s;ecretary of
&s;tate, and Fox the King's almoner; and as the bu&s;ine&s;s of the divorce
became the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation, he ob&s;erved, that the readie&s;t way
either to quiet Henry's con&s;cience or extort the pope's con|&s;ent, would be
to con&s;ult all the univer&s;ities of Europe with regard to this con|troverted
point: If they agreed to approve the King's marriage with Cathe|rine, his
remor&s;es would naturally cea&s;e; if they condemned it, the pope would find
it difficult to re&s;i&s;t the &s;ollicitations of &s;o great a monarch,

Heylin, p. 5.</NOTE>. When the King was informed of this propo&s;al, he was
delighted with it; and &s;wore, with more alacrity than delicacy, that Cranmer
had got the right &s;ow by the ear: He &s;ent for that di|vine: Entered into
conver&s;ation with him: Conceived a high opinion of his virtue and
under&s;tanding: Engaged him to write in defence of the divorce: And
immediately, in pro&s;ecution of the &s;cheme propo&s;ed, employed his agents
to collect the judgment of all the univer&s;ities in Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="172"> HAD the que&s;tion of Henry's marriage
with Catherine been examined by the principles of &s;ound philo&s;ophy, exempt
from &s;uper&s;tition, it &s;eemed not liable to much difficulty. The natural
rea&s;on, why marriage in certain degrees is prohi|bited by the civil laws, and
condemned by the moral &s;entiments of all nations, is derived from men's care
to pre&s;erve purity of manners; while they reflect, that if a commerce of love
were authorized between the neare&s;t relations, the frequent opportunities of
intimate conver&s;ation, e&s;pecially during early youth, would in|troduce an
univer&s;al di&s;&s;olutene&s;s and corruption. But as the cu&s;toms of
coun|tries vary con&s;iderably, and open an intercour&s;e, more or le&s;s
re&s;trained, between different families, or between the &s;everal members of
the &s;ame family, &s;o we find, that the moral precept, varying with its
cau&s;e, is &s;u&s;ceptible, without any incon|venience, of very different
latitude in the &s;everal ages and nations of the world. The extreme delicacy
of the Greeks, permitted no conver&s;e between per&s;ons of the two fexes,
except where they lived under the &s;ame roof; and even the apartments of a
&s;tep-mother, and her daughters, were almo&s;t as much &s;hut up again&s;t
vi&s;its from the hu&s;band's &s;ons, as again&s;t tho&s;e from any &s;trangers
or more remote relations: Hence in that nation it was lawful for a man to
marry, not only his niece, but his half&punc;&s;i&s;ter by the father: A
liberty unknown to the Romans, and other nations, where a more open
intercour&s;e was authori&s;ed be|tween the &s;exes. Rea&s;oning from this
principle, it would appear, that the ordi|nary commerce of life among great
princes, is &s;o ob&s;tructed by ceremony, and numerous attendants, that no ill
con&s;equence would re&s;ult among them, from the marriage of a brother's
widow; e&s;pecially if the di&s;pen&s;ation of the &s;ove|reign prie&s;t is
previou&s;ly required, in order to ju&s;tify what may in common ca&s;es be
condemned, and to hinder the precedent from becoming too common and familiar.
And as &s;trong motives of public intere&s;t and tranquillity may frequently
require &s;uch alliances between the &s;overeign families, there is le&s;s
rea&s;on for extending towards them the full rigour of that rule which has
place among individuals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Even judging of this que&s;tion
by the &s;cripture, to which the appeal was every moment made, the arguments
for the King's cau&s;e appear but lame and imperfect. Marriage in the degree of
affi|nity which had place between Henry and Catherine, is, indeed, prohibited
in Leviticus; but it is na|tural to interpret that prohibition as a part of the
Jewi&s;h ceremonial or municipal law: And tho' it is there &s;aid, in the
conclu&s;ion, that the gentile nations, by violating the&s;e degrees of

the patriarchs: And the marriage of a brother's widow was, in certain ca&s;es,
not only permitted, but even enjoined as a po&s;itive precept by the
Mo|&s;aical law. It is in vain to &s;ay, that this precept was an exception to
the rule; and an exception con|fined merely to the Jewi&s;h nation. The
inference is &s;till ju&s;t, that &s;uch a marriage can contain no na|tural or
moral turpitude; otherwi&s;e God, who is the author of all purity, would never,
in any ca&s;e, have enjoined it.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE extremities to which Henry was pu&s;hed, both again&s;t the
pope and the eccle&s;ia&s;tical order, were naturally very di&s;agreeable to
cardinal Wol&s;ey; and as Henry fore&s;aw his oppo&s;ition, it is the mo&s;t
probable rea&s;on which can be a&s;&s;igned for his continuing to per&s;ecute
with &s;o much rigour his ancient favourite. After Wol&s;ey had remained &s;ome
time at A&s;her, he was allowed to remove to Rich|mond, a palace which he had
received as a pre&s;ent from Henry, in return for Hampton-Court: But the
courtiers, dreading &s;till his near neighbourhood to the King, procured an
order for him to remove to his &s;ee of York. The car|dinal knew it was vain to
re&s;i&s;t: He took up his re&s;idence at Cawood in York|&s;hire, where he
rendered him&s;elf extremely popular to the neighbourhood, by his affability
and ho&s;pitality<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cavendi&s;h. Stowe, p.

retreat. The earl of Northumberland received orders, without regard to
Wol&s;ey's eccle&s;ia&s;tical character, to arre&s;t him for high trea&s;on,
and to conduct him to London, in order to his trial. The cardinal, partly from
the fatigues of the journey, partly from the agitation of his anxious mind, was
&s;eized with a di&s;order which turned into a dy&s;entery; and he was able,
with &s;ome difficulty, to reach Leice&s;ter-abbey. When the abbot and monks
advanced to receive him with much re&s;pect and ceremony, he told them, that he
was come to lay his bones among them; and he immediately took his bed, whence
he ne|ver ro&s;e more.

of the King's temper may alleviate much of the blame which &s;ome of his

&s;ub&s;e|quent part of Henry's reign was much more unfortunate and criminal
than that which was directed by Wol&s;ey's councils, we &s;hall be inclined to
&s;u&s;pect of par|tiality tho&s;e hi&s;torians, who have endeavoured to load
his memory with &s;uch vio|lent reproaches. If in foreign politics, he
&s;ometimes employed his influence over the King for his private purpo&s;es,
rather than his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t, which, he boa&s;ted, he had &s;olely at
heart; we mu&s;t remember, that he had in view the papal throne; a dignity,
which, had he attained it, would have enabled him to make Henry a &s;uitable
return for all his favours. The cardinal d'Amboi&s;e, who&s;e memory is
precious in France, always made this apology for his own conduct, which was, in
&s;ome re&s;pects, &s;imilar to Wol&s;ey's; and we have rea&s;on to think, that
Henry was well acquainted with the motives by which his mini&s;ter was
in|fluenced. He regreted very much his death, when informed of it; and always
&s;poke favourably of his memory: A proof, that humour more than rea&s;on, or

have been the certain con&s;equence of not &s;ubmitting to Wol&s;ey's

men to make &s;uch &s;ettlements, or tru&s;t deeds, of their land by will, that
they defrauded, not only the King, but all other lords, of their wards,
marriages, and reliefs; and by the &s;ame artifice the King was de|prived of
his primier &s;ei&s;in, and the profits of the livery, which were no
in|con&s;iderable branches of the revenue. Henry made a bill be drawn to
mode|rate, not remedy altogether, this abu&s;e: He was contented, that every
man <PB N="172" REF="177"> &s;hould have the liberty of di&s;po&s;ing in this

might &s;ee, that his power and authority, tho' exten&s;ive, had yet &s;ome
boundaries. The commons, however, found rea&s;on to repent of their victory.

to the pope, when their proceedings were &s;uddenly &s;topped by the breaking
out of the plague at We&s;tmin&s;ter, which occa&s;ioned a prorogation. It is
remarkable, that one Tem&s;e ventured this &s;e&s;&s;ion to move, that the

pro&s;ecution of his divorce. This motion occa&s;ioned the King to &s;end for
Audley, the Speaker; and to explain to him the &s;cruples with which his
con&s;cience had &s;o long been agitated; &s;cruples, he &s;aid, which had
proceeded from no wanton appetite, which had ari&s;en after the fervours of
youth were over, and which were confirmed by the concurring &s;enti|ments of
all the learned &s;ocieties in Europe. Except in Spain and Portugal, he added,
it was never heard of, that any man had e&s;pou&s;ed two &s;i&s;ters; but he

who had ever married his brother's widow<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Hall, fol. 205.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the prorogation, Sir Thomas More, the chancellor,
fore&s;eeing that all the mea&s;ures of the King and Parliament tended to a
breach with the church of Rome, and to an alteration of religion, which his
principles would not permit him to concur with, de&s;ired leave to re&s;ign the
&s;eals; and he de&s;cended from this high &s;tation with more joy and alacrity
than he had mounted up to it. The au&s;terity of this man's virtue, and the
&s;anctity of his manners, had no way en|croached on the gentlene&s;s of his
temper, nor even dimini&s;hed that frolic and gaity to which he was naturally
inclined. He &s;ported with all the varieties of fortune into which he was
thrown; and neither the pride naturally attending a <PB N="173" REF="178"> high
&s;tation, nor the melancholy incident to poverty and retreat, could ever lay
hold of his &s;erene and equal &s;pirit. While his family di&s;covered
&s;ymptoms of &s;orrow on laying down the grandeur and magnificence to which
they had been accu&s;tomed, he drew a &s;ubject of mirth from their
di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and made them a&s;hamed of lo&s;ing even a moment's
chearfulne&s;s, on account of &s;uch trivial mi&s;|fortunes. The King, who had
entertained a high opinion of his virtue, admit|ted his re&s;ignation with
&s;ome difficulty; and he be&s;towed the &s;eals &s;oon after on Sir Thomas
Audley.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions in England, and the&s;e
inva&s;ions of the papal and eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority, the court of Rome
were not without &s;olicitude; and they entertained very ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions
of lo&s;ing entirely their authority in Eng|land; the kingdom, which, of all
others, had long been mo&s;t devoted to the holy &s;ee, and which had yielded
it the mo&s;t ample revenue. While the im|perial cardinals pu&s;hed Clement to
proceed to extremities again&s;t the King, his more moderate and impartial
coun&s;ellors repre&s;ented to him the indignity of his proceedings; that a
great monarch, who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf, both by his pen and his &s;word,
in the pope's cau&s;e, &s;hould be refu&s;ed a favor, which he de|manded on
&s;uch ju&s;t grounds, and which had &s;carce ever before been denied to any
per&s;on of his rank and &s;tation. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e remon&s;trances,
the Queen's appeal was received at Rome; the King was cited to appear; and
&s;everal con|&s;i&s;tories were held, to examine the validity of their
marriage. Henry was de|termined not to &s;end any proxy to plead his cau&s;e
before this court: He only di&s;patched Sir Edward Karne and Dr. Bonner, in
quality of excu&s;ators, &s;o they were called, to carry his apology, for not
paying that deference to the papal au|thority. The prerogative of his crown, he
&s;aid, mu&s;t be &s;acrificed, if he allow|ed of appeals from his own kingdom;
and as the que&s;tion regarded con&s;cience, not power or intere&s;t, no proxy
could &s;upply his place, or convey that &s;atisfaction which the dictates of
his own mind could alone confer. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 October.</NOTE> In order to &s;upport
him&s;elf in this mea&s;ure, and add greater &s;ecurity to his defection from
Rome, he procured an interview with Francis at Boulogne and Calais, where he
renewed his per&s;onal friend&s;hip, as well as public alliance, with that
monarch, and con|certed all mea&s;ures for their mutual defence. He even
employed arguments, by which, he believed, he had per&s;uaded Francis to
imitate his example in withdraw|ing his obedience from the bi&s;hop of Rome,
and admini&s;tering eccle&s;ia&s;tical af|fairs without having farther
recour&s;e to that &s;ee. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 November.</NOTE> And being now fully

he had totally forborne all vi&s;its and intercour&s;e with her; and had

bull&punc; directed to the King, he is, upon the royal nomination, made
archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. By a &s;econd, directed to him&s;elf, he is made
archbi&s;hop. By a third, he is ab&s;olved from all cen&s;ures. A fourth, is to

An eighth to all that held lands of it. By a ninth he was ordained to be

pall was &s;ent him. By an ele|venth, the archbi&s;hop of York, and the
bi&s;hop of London, were required to put it on him. The&s;e were &s;o many
artifices to draw fees to offices, which the popes had erected, and
di&s;po&s;ed of for money. It may be worth ob&s;erving, that Cranmer, before he
took the oath to the pope, made a prote&s;tation, that he did not intend
thereby to re&s;train him&s;elf from any thing that he was bound to, either by
his duty to God, the King, or the country; and that he renounced every thing in
it that was contrary to any of the&s;e. This device was the invention of &s;ome
ca&s;ui&s;t, and not very compatible with that &s;trict &s;incerity, and that
&s;crupulous con&s;cience, of which Cranmer made profe&s;&s;ion. Collier, vol.

open his <PB N="175" REF="180"> court for examining the validity of her
marriage. The near neighbourhood of the place was cho&s;en in order to deprive
her of all plea of ignorance; and as &s;he made no an&s;wer to the citation,
neither by her&s;elf nor proxy, &s;he was declared <HI>contumacious;</HI> and
the primate proceeded to the examination of the cau&s;e. The evidences of
Arthur's con&s;ummation of the marriage were produced; the opi|nions of the
univer&s;ities were read; together with the judgment pronounced two years
before by the convocations both of Canterbury and York; and after the&s;e
preparatory &s;teps, Cranmer proceeded to a &s;entence, and annulled the King's
marriage with Catherine as unlawful and invalid. By a &s;ub&s;equent
&s;entence, he ratified the marriage with Anne Boleyn, who &s;oon after was
publicly crowned Queen, with all the pomp and dignity &s;uited to that
ceremony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 6.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 September.</NOTE> To compleat the King's
&s;atisfaction, on the conclu&s;ion of this intricate and vexatious affair,
&s;he was &s;afely delivered of a daughter, who received the name of Elizabeth,
and who afterwards &s;wayed the &s;cepter with &s;uch renown and felicity.
Henry was &s;o much delighted with the birth of this child, that &s;oon after
he conferred on her the title of prince&s;s of Wales<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 134.</NOTE>; a &s;tep &s;omewhat irregular, as
&s;he was only pre&s;umptive, not apparent heir of the crown. But he had,
during his former marriage, thought proper to honour his daughter Mary with
that title; and he was determined to be&s;tow on the offspring of his pre&s;ent
marriage, the &s;ame marks of di&s;tinction, as well as exclude Mary from all
hopes of the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion. His regard for the new Queen &s;eemed rather to
increa&s;e than dimini&s;h by his marriage; and all men expected to &s;ee the
entire a&s;cendant of one who had mount|ed a throne, from which her birth had
&s;et her at &s;o great a di&s;tance, and who, by a proper mixture of
&s;everity and indulgence, had long managed &s;o intractable a &s;pirit as that
of Henry. In order to efface, as much as po&s;&s;ible, all marks of his fir&s;t
marriage, Lord Mountjoy was &s;ent to the unfortunate and divorced Queen, to
inform her, that &s;he was henceforth to be treated only as prince&s;s dowager
of Wales; and all means were employed to make her acquie&s;ce in that
determination. But &s;he continued ob&s;tinate in maintaining the validity of
her marriage; and &s;he would admit of no &s;ervice from any per&s;on, who did
not ap|proach her with the accu&s;tomed ceremonial. Henry, forgetting his
wonted ge|nero&s;ity towards her, employed menaces again&s;t &s;uch of her
&s;ervants as com|plied <PB N="176" REF="181"> with her commands in this
particular; but was never able to make her relinqui&s;h her title and

<P>WHEN intelligence was conveyed to Rome of the&s;e
tran&s;actions, &s;o injurious to the authority and reputation of the holy
&s;ee, the conclave were in a rage, and all the cardinals of the imperial
faction urged the pope to proceed to a definitive &s;entence, and to emit his
&s;piritual thunders again&s;t Henry. But Clement pro|ceeded no farther than to
declare the nullity of Cranmer's &s;entence, as well as that of Henry's
&s;econd marriage; threatening him with excommunication, if, before the fir&s;t
of November en&s;uing, he did not replace every thing in the con|dition, in
which they formerly &s;tood<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le Grand, vol. 3. p.
566.</NOTE>. An event had happened, from which the pontiff expected a more
amicable conclu&s;ion of the difference, and which hindered him from carrying
matters to extremity again&s;t the King.</P>
<P>THE pope had claims upon the dutchy of Ferrara for the
&s;overeignty of Reg|gio and Modena<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 2. p.
133. Guicciardini.</NOTE>; and having &s;ubmitted his preten&s;ions to the
arbitration of the emperor, he was &s;urprized to find a &s;entence pronounced
again&s;t him. En|raged at this di&s;appointment, he hearkened to propo&s;als
of amity from Francis; and when that monarch made overtures of marrying the
duke of Orleans, his &s;econd &s;on, with Catherine of Medici, niece to the
pope, Clement gladly em|braced an alliance, by which his family was &s;o much
honoured. An interview was even appointed of the pope and French King at
Mar&s;eilles; and Francis, as a common friend, employed his good offices in
mediating an agreement between his new ally and the King of England.</P>
<P>HAD this connexion of France with the &s;ee of Rome taken place
a few years &s;ooner, there had been little difficulty in compo&s;ing the
quarrel with Henry. The King's reque&s;t was an ordinary one; and the &s;ame
plenary power of the pope, which had granted a di&s;pen&s;ation for his
e&s;pou&s;ing Catherine, could ea&s;ily have annulled the marriage. But in the
progre&s;s of the quarrel, the &s;tate of affairs was much changed on both
&s;ides. Henry had &s;haken off much of that reverence with which he had been
early imbued for the apo&s;tolical &s;ee; and finding, that his &s;ubjects of
all ranks had taken part with him, and willingly complied with his movements
for breaking foreign dependance, he had taken a reli&s;h for his &s;piritual
authority, and would &s;carce, it was apprehended, be induced to renew his
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the Roman pontiff. The pope, on the other hand, ran now a
manife&s;t ri&s;que of infringing his authority by a compliance with the King;
and <PB N="177" REF="182"> as a &s;entence of divorce could no longer be
re&s;ted on nullities in Julius's bull, but would be con&s;trued as an

u&s;urpations, it was fore|&s;een, that the Lutherans would thence take
occa&s;ion of triumph, and would per&s;evere more ob&s;tinately in their
pre&s;ent principles. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e ob&s;tacles, Francis did
not de&s;pair of mediating an agreement. He &s;till ob&s;erved that the King
had &s;ome remains of prejudice in favour of the apo&s;tolic &s;ee, and was
apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;equences, which might on&s;ue from too violent
inno|vations. He &s;aw plainly the intere&s;t, that Clement had in pre&s;erving
the obedience of England, which was one of the riche&s;t jewels in the papal
crown. And he hoped, that the&s;e motives on both &s;ides would facilitate a
mutual agreement, and would forward the effects of his good offices.</P>
<P>FRANCIS fir&s;t prevailed on the pope to promi&s;e, that, if the
King would &s;end a proxy to Rome, and thereby &s;ubmit his cau&s;e to the holy
&s;ee, he would appoint commi&s;&s;ioners to meet at Cambray, and form the
proce&s;s; and he would imme|diately afterwards pronounce the &s;entence of
divorce, required of him. Bellay, bi&s;hop of Paris, was next di&s;patched to
London, and obtained a promi&s;e of the King, that he would &s;ubmit his
cau&s;e to the Roman con&s;i&s;tory, provided the cardinals of the imperial
faction were excluded from it. <MILESTONE N="1534" UNIT="year"> The prelate
carried this verbal promi&s;e to Rome; and the pope agreed, that, if the King
would &s;ign a written agreement to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, his demands &s;hould
be fully complied with. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's final breach with Rome.</NOTE> A day
was appointed for the return of the me&s;&s;engers; and all the world re|garded
this affair, which had threatened a violent rupture between England and the
Romi&s;h church, as drawing towards an amicable conclu&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>. But the greate&s;t affairs often
depend on the mo&s;t frivolous incidents. The courier, who carried the King's
written promi&s;e, was detained beyond the day appointed: News are brought to
Rome that a libel had been publi&s;hed in England again&s;t the court of Rome,
and a farce acted before the King in deri&s;ion of the pope and cardinals<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d March.</NOTE> The pope and cardinals enter
into the con&s;i&s;tory enflamed with anger; and by a precipitate &s;entence,
the marriage of Henry and Catherine was pronounced valid, and Henry declared to
be excommunicated if he refu&s;ed to adhere to it. Two days after, the courier
arrived; and Clement, who had been hurried from his u&s;ual prudence, found,
that, tho' he repented heartily of this ha&s;ty mea&s;ure, it would be
difficult for him to retract it, or replace affairs on the &s;ame footing as
before.</P>
<P>IT is not probable, that the pope, had he conducted him&s;elf
with ever &s;o great moderation and temper, could hope, during the life-time of
Henry, to have regained much authority or influence in England. That monarch
was both im|petuous <PB N="178" REF="183"> and ob&s;tinate in his character;
and having proceeded &s;o far in throwing off the papal yoke, he never could
again have been induced tamely to bend his neck to it. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 January.</NOTE> Even at the time, when he
was negotiating a reconcilement with Rome, he either entertained &s;o little
hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, or was &s;o indifferent about the event, that he had
a&s;&s;embled a Parliament; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> and continued to enact
laws totally de&s;tructive of the papal authority. The people had been prepared
by degrees for this great innovation. Each preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion had
retrenched &s;ome|thing from the power and profit of the pontiff. Care had been
taken, during &s;ome years, to teach the nation, that a general council was
much &s;uperior to the pope. But now a bi&s;hop preached every Sunday at Paul's
Cro&s;s, in order to inculcate the doctrine, that the pope was intitled to no
authority at all be|yond the bounds of his own dioce&s;e<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 144.</NOTE>. The proceedings of the Parliament
&s;howed that they had entirely adopted this opinion; and there is rea&s;on to
believe, that the King, after having procured a favourable &s;entence from
Rome, which would have removed all the doubts with regard to his &s;econd
marriage and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, might indeed have lived on terms of civility
with the apo&s;tolic &s;ee, but never would have &s;urrendered to it any
con&s;iderable &s;hare of his a&s;&s;umed prero|gative. The nature and
importance of the laws, pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, even before news arrived
of the violent re&s;olutions taken at Rome, is &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify this
opinion.</P>
<P>ALL payments made to the apo&s;tolic chamber; all provi&s;ions,
bulls, di&s;pen&s;a|tions, were aboli&s;hed: Mona&s;teries were &s;ubjected to
the vi&s;itation and govern|ment of the King alone: The law for puni&s;hing
heretics was moderated; the ordinary was prohibited to impri&s;on or try any
per&s;on upon &s;u&s;picion alone, without pre&s;entment by two lawful
witne&s;&s;es; and it was declared, that to &s;peak again&s;t the pope's
authority was no here&s;y: Bi&s;hops were to be appointed, by a

commi&s;&s;ioners, in order to examine the old canons, and abrogate &s;uch as

An appeal was al&s;o allowed from the bi&s;hop's court to the King in
Chancery.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t important law pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was
that which regulated the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown: The marriage of the
King with Catherine was declared unlawful, void, and of no effect: The
primate's &s;entence, annulling it, was ra|tified: And the marriage with Queen
Anne was e&s;tabli&s;hed and confirmed. The crown was appointed to de&s;cend to
the i&s;&s;ue of that marriage, and failing them to the King's heirs for ever.
An oath likewi&s;e was ordered to be taken in favour of this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
under penalty of impri&s;onment during the King's plea&s;ure, and forfeiture of
goods and chattels. And all &s;lander again&s;t the King, Queen, or their
i&s;&s;ue, was &s;ubjected to the penalty of mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on. After
the&s;e compliances, the Parliament was prorogued; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th March.</NOTE> and tho&s;e acts, &s;o
contemptuous towards the pope, and &s;o de&s;tructive of his authority, were
pa&s;&s;ed at the very time that Clement pronounced his ha&s;ty &s;entence
again&s;t the King. Henry's re&s;entment again&s;t Queen Catherine, on account
of her ob&s;tinacy, was the rea&s;on why he excluded her daughter from all
hopes of &s;ucceeding to the crown; con|trary to his fir&s;t intention, when he
began the &s;uit of divorce, and of di&s;pen&s;a|tion for a &s;econd
marriage.</P>
<P>THE King found his eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ubjects as compliant as
the laity. The con|vocation ordered, that the act again&s;t appeals to Rome,
together with the King's appeal from the pope to a general council, &s;hould be
affixed to the doors of all the churches in the kingdom: And they voted, that
the bi&s;hop of Rome had, by the law of God, no more juri&s;diction in England
than any other foreign bi&s;hop; and that the authority, which he and his
predece&s;&s;ors had exerci&s;ed there, was only by u&s;urpation and the
&s;ufferance of Engli&s;h princes. Four per&s;ons only oppo&s;ed this vote in
the lower hou&s;e, and one doubted. It pa&s;&s;ed unanimou&s;ly in the upper.
The bi&s;hops went &s;o far in their complai&s;ance, that they took out new
commi&s;&s;ions from the crown, where all their &s;piritual and epi&s;copal
authority was expre&s;sly affirmed to be derived ultimately from the civil
magi&s;trate, and to be entirely dependent on his good plea&s;ure<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Collier's Eccl. Hi&s;t. vol. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE oath regarding the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was generally &s;worn
throughout the king|dom. Fi&s;her, bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, and Sir Thomas
More, were the only per|&s;ons of note, who entertained &s;cruples with regard
to its legality. Fi&s;her was obnoxious on account of &s;ome practices, into
which his credulity, rather than any bad intentions, &s;eems to have betrayed
him. But More was the per&s;on of greate&s;t reputation in the kingdom for
virtue and integrity; and as it was be|lieved, <PB N="180" REF="185"> that his
authority would have influence on the &s;entiments of others, great pains were
taken to convince him of the lawfulne&s;s of the oath. He declared, that he had
no &s;cruple with regard to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and thought that the
Par|liament had full power to &s;ettle it: He offered to draw an oath
him&s;elf, which would a&s;&s;ure his allegiance to the heir appointed; but he
refu&s;ed the oath pre|&s;cribed by law; becau&s;e the preamble of that oath
a&s;&s;erted the legality of the King's marriage with Anne, and thereby
implied, that his former marriage with Catherine was unlawful and invalid.
Cranmer, the primate, and Cromwel, now &s;ecretary of &s;tate, who highly loved
and e&s;teemed More, earne&s;tly &s;ollicited him to lay a&s;ide his
&s;cruples; and their friendly entreaties &s;eemed to weigh more with him, than
all the penalties attending his refu&s;al<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol.
1. p. 156.</NOTE>. He per&s;i&s;ted however, in a mild, tho' firm manner, to
maintain his re&s;olution; and the King, irritated again&s;t him as well as
Fi&s;her, ordered them both to be indicted upon the &s;latute, and committed
pri&s;oners to the Tower.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3d Novem|ber.</NOTE> THE Parliament, being
again a&s;&s;embled, conferred on the King the title of the only &s;upreme
<HI>head</HI> on earth of the church of England; as they had already inve&s;ted
him with all the real power belonging to it. In this memorable act, the
Parliament granted him power, or rather acknowledged his inherent power, 
<Q REND="inline">"to vi&s;it, and repre&s;s, redre&s;s, reform,
order, correct, re&s;train, or amend all errors, here&s;ies, abu&s;es,

or juri&s;diction<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">26 H. 8. c. 1.</NOTE>."</Q>
They al&s;o declared it trea&s;on to attempt, imagine, or &s;peak evil
again&s;t the King, Queen, or his heirs, or to endeavour the depriving them of
their dignities or titles. They gave him a right to all the annates and tythes
of benefices, which had formerly been paid to the court of Rome. They granted
him a &s;ub&s;idy and a fifteenth. They attainted More and Fi&s;her for
mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on. And they united England and Wales together, by
giving to that principality all the benefit of the Engli&s;h laws.</P>
<P>THUS the authority of the popes, like all exorbitant power, was
ruined by the exce&s;s of its acqui&s;itions, and by &s;tretching its
preten&s;ions beyond what it was po&s;|&s;ible for any human principles or
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to &s;u&s;tain. The right of granting indulgences had in
former ages contributed extremely to enrich the holy &s;ee; but being openly
abu&s;ed, &s;erved to excite the fir&s;t commotions and oppo&s;itions in
Germany. The prerogative of granting di&s;pen&s;ations had al&s;o contributed
much to attach all the &s;overeign princes and great families in Europe to the
papal authority; but meeting with an unlucky concurrence of circum&s;tances,
was now the cau&s;e, why England &s;eparated her&s;elf from the Romi&s;h
communion. The acknowledgment of the King's &s;upremacy introduced there a
greater &s;implicity into <PB N="181" REF="186"> the government, by uniting the
&s;piritual with the civil power, and preventing di&s;|putes about limits,
which never could be exactly determined between the con|tending parties. A way
was al&s;o prepared for checking the exorbitancy of &s;u|per&s;tition, and
breaking tho&s;e &s;hakles, by which all human rea&s;on, policy, and indu&s;try
had &s;o long been incumbered. The prince, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, being head
of the religion, as well as of the temporal juri&s;diction of the kingdom, tho'
he might &s;ometimes employ the former as an engine of government, had no
intere&s;t, like the Roman pontiff, in nouri&s;hing its exce&s;&s;ive growth;
and, ex|cept when blinded by ignorance or bigotry, would be &s;ure to retain it
within tolerable limits, and prevent its abu&s;es. And on the whole, there
followed from the&s;e revolutions very beneficial con&s;equences; tho' perhaps
neither fore&s;een nor intended by the per&s;ons who had the chief hand in
conducting them.</P>
<P>WHILE Henry proceeded with &s;o much order and tranquillity in
changing the antient religion, and while his authority &s;eemed entirely
&s;ecure in Eng|land, he was held in &s;ome inquietude by the &s;tate of
affairs in Ireland and in Scotland.</P>
<P>THE earl of Kildare was deputy of Ireland, under the duke of
Richmond, the King's natural &s;on, who bore the title of lieutenant; and as
Kildare was accu&s;ed of &s;ome violences again&s;t the family of O&s;&s;ory,
his hereditary enemy, he was called over to an&s;wer for his conduct. He left
his authority in the hands of his &s;on, who hearing that his father was thrown
into pri&s;on, and was in danger of his life, immediately took up arms, and
joining him&s;elf to Oneale, Ocarrol, and other Iri&s;h nobility, committed
many ravages, murdered Allen, archbi&s;hop of Dublin, and laid &s;iege to that
city. Old Kildare mean-while died in pri&s;on, and his &s;on, per&s;evering in
his revolt, made applications to the em|peror, who promi&s;ed him
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The King was obliged to &s;end over &s;ome forces to Ireland,
which &s;o harra&s;&s;ed the rebels, that Kildare, finding the emperor backward
in fulfilling his promi&s;es, was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of
&s;urrendering him&s;elf pri&s;oner to lord Leonard Gray, the new deputy,
brother to the marquis of Dor&s;et. He was &s;ent over to England, together
with his five uncles; and after trial and conviction, they were all brought to
public ju&s;tice; tho' two of the uncles, in order to &s;ave the family, had
pretended to join the King's party.</P>
<P>THE earl of Angus had acquired the entire a&s;cendant in
Scotland, and hav|ing got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the King's per&s;on, then in
early youth, he was able, by means of that advantage, and by employing the
power of his own family, to retain the reins of government. The queen dowager,
however, his &s;pou&s;e, bred him great di&s;turbance: For having &s;eparated
her&s;elf from him, on account of &s;ome jealou&s;ies and di&s;gu&s;ts, and
having procured a divorce, &s;he had married <PB N="182" REF="187"> another man
of quality of the name of Stuart; and &s;he joined all the di&s;con|tented
nobility, who oppo&s;ed Angus's authority. James him&s;elf was di&s;&s;atisfied
with the &s;lavery, to which he was reduced; and by &s;ecret corre&s;pondence,
he excited fir&s;t Walter Scot, then the earl of Lenox, to attempt, by force of
arms, to free him from the hands of Angus. Both enterprizes failed of
&s;ucce&s;s; but James, impatient of re&s;traint, found means at la&s;t of
flying to Stirling, where his mother then re&s;ided; and having &s;ummoned all
the nobility to attend him, he overturned the authority of the Dougla&s;&s;es,
and obliged Angus and his brother to fly into England, where they were
protected by Henry. The King of Scotland, being now arrived at years of
majority, took the government into his own hands; and employed him&s;elf with
great &s;pirit and valour, in repre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e feuds, ravages, and
di&s;orders, which, tho' they di&s;turbed the cour&s;e of public ju&s;tice,
&s;erved to &s;upport the martial &s;pirit of the Scotch, and contributed, by
that means, to maintain national independancy. He was de&s;irous of renew|ing
the antient league with the French nation; but finding Francis in clo&s;e union
with England, and on that account &s;omewhat cold in hearkening to his
pro|po&s;als, he received the more favourably the advances of the emperor, who
hoped, by means of &s;uch an ally, to breed di&s;turbance to England. He
offered the Scotch King the choice of three prince&s;&s;es, his near relations,
and all of the name of Mary; his &s;i&s;ter the dowager of Hungary, his niece a
daughter of Portugal, or his cou&s;in, the daughter of Henry; whom he pretended
to di&s;|po&s;e of unknown to her father. James was more inclined to the latter
propo&s;al, had it not, upon reflection, been found impracticable; and his
natural propen&s;ity to France at la&s;t prevailed over all other
con&s;iderations. The alliance with Francis nece&s;&s;arily engaged James to
agree to terms of peace with England. But tho' invited by his uncle, Henry, to
confer with him at Newca&s;tle, and con|cert common mea&s;ures for
repre&s;&s;ing the eccle&s;ia&s;tics in both kingdoms, and &s;haking off the
yoke of Rome, he could not be prevailed with to put him&s;elf in the King's
power. In order to have a pretext for refu&s;ing the conference, he applied to
the pope, and obtained a brief, forbidding him to engage in any per|&s;onal

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Religious principles of the people.</NOTE>
THE antient and almo&s;t uninterrupted oppo&s;ition of intere&s;t between the
laity and clergy in England, and between the Engli&s;h Clergy and the court of
Rome, had &s;ufficiently prepared the nation for a breach with the Roman
pontiff; and men had penetration enough to di&s;cover abu&s;es, which were
plainly calculated for the temporal advantages of the hierarchy, and which they
found de&s;tructive of their own. The&s;e &s;ubjects &s;eemed proportioned to
human under|&s;tanding; and even the people, who felt the power of intere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t in their own brea&s;ts, could
perceive the purpo&s;e of tho&s;e numerous inventions, which the in|tere&s;ted
&s;pirit of the &s;overeign pontiff had introduced into religion. But when the
reformers proceeded thence to di&s;pute concerning the nature of the
&s;acra|ments, the operations of grace, the terms of acceptance with the
dei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y, men were thrown into
amazement, and were, during &s;ome time, at a lo&s;s how to chu&s;e their
party. The profound ignorance, in which both the clergy and laity formerly
lived, and their freedom from theological altercations, had produced a
&s;incere, but indolent acquie&s;cence in received opinions; and the multitude
were neither attached to them by topics of rea&s;oning, nor by tho&s;e
prejudices and antipathies again&s;t opponents, which have ever a more natural
and powerful influence over them. As &s;oon as a new opinion therefore was
advanced, &s;up|ported by &s;uch an authority as to call up their attention,
they felt their capacity totally unfitted for &s;uch di&s;qui&s;itions; and
they perpetually fluctuated between the contending parties. Hence the &s;udden
and violent movements by which the <PB N="184" REF="189"> people were agitated,
even in the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite directions: Hence their &s;eeming pro&s;titution
in &s;acrificing to pre&s;ent power the mo&s;t &s;acred principles: And hence
the rapid progre&s;s during &s;ome time, and the &s;udden as well as entire
check given afterwards to the new doctrines. When men were once &s;ettled in
their particular &s;ects, and had fortified them&s;elves in a habitual
dete&s;tation again&s;t tho&s;e e&s;teemed heretics, they adhered with more
ob&s;tinacy to the principles of their education; and the limits of the two
religions remained thenceforth fixed and unchangeable.</P>
<P>NOTHING forwarded more the fir&s;t progre&s;s of the reformers,
than the offer, which they made, of &s;ubmitting all religious doctrines to
private judgment, and the &s;ummons given every one to examine the principles
formerly impo&s;ed upon him. Tho' the multitude were totally unqualified for
this undertaking, they yet were highly plea&s;ed with it. They fancied that
they were exerci&s;ing their judg|ment; while they oppo&s;ed to the prejudices
of ancient authority more powerful prejudices of another kind. The novelty
it&s;elf of the doctrines; the plea&s;ure of an imaginary triumph in di&s;pute;
the fervent zeal of the reformed preachers; their patience, and even alacrity,
in &s;uffering per&s;ecution, death, and torments; a di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t the
re&s;traints of the old religion; an indignation again&s;t the tyranny and
intere&s;ted &s;pirit of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics; the&s;e motives were prevalent
with the people, and by &s;uch con&s;iderations were men &s;o generally induced
during that age, to throw off the religion of their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>BUT in proportion as the practice of &s;ubmitting religion to
private judgment was acceptable to the people, it appeared, in &s;ome
re&s;pects, dangerous to the rights of &s;overeigns, and &s;eemed to de&s;troy
that implicit obedience on which the authority of the civil magi&s;trate is
chiefly founded. The very precedent of &s;hak|ing &s;uch an ancient and deep
founded e&s;tabli&s;hment as that of the Roman hierar|chy might, it was
apprehended, prepare the way for new innovations. The re|publican &s;pirit,
which naturally took place among the reformers, increa&s;ed this jealou&s;y.
The furious in&s;urrections of the populace, excited by Muncer and other
anabapti&s;ts in Germany<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sleidan, lib. 4. &amp;
5.</NOTE>, furni&s;hed a new pretence for decrying the re|formation. Nor
&s;hould we conclude, becau&s;e prote&s;tants in our time prove as dutiful
&s;ubjects as tho&s;e of any other religion, that therefore &s;uch
apprehen&s;ions were altogether without any appearance or plau&s;ibility. Tho'
the liberty of pri|vate judgment be tendered to the di&s;ciples of the
reformation, it is not in reality accepted of; and men are generally contented
to acquie&s;ce in tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, however new, into which their
early education has thrown them.</P>
<P>NO prince in Europe was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch ab&s;olute
authority as Henry, not even the pope him&s;elf, in his own capital, where he
united both the civil and <PB N="185" REF="190"> eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Here are the terms in which the King's mini&s;ter

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the King.</NOTE> But be&s;ides this
political jealou&s;y, there was another rea&s;on which in&s;pired this
imperious monarch with an aver&s;ion to the reformers. He had early declared
his &s;entiments again&s;t Luther; and having entered the li&s;ts in tho&s;e
&s;chola&s;tic quarrels, he had received, from his courtiers and theologians,
infinite applau&s;e for his performance. Elated by this imaginary &s;ucce&s;s,
and blinded by a natural arrogance and ob&s;tinacy of temper, he had
entertained the mo&s;t lofty opinion of his own erudition, and he received with
impatience, mixed with contempt, any contradiction to his &s;entiments. Luther
al&s;o had been &s;o imprudent, as to treat in a very indecent manner his royal
antagoni&s;t; and tho' he afterwards made the humble&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to
Henry, and apologized for the vehemence of his former expre&s;&s;ions, he never
could efface the hatred which the King had conceived again&s;t him and his
doctrines. The idea of here&s;y &s;till appear|ed dete&s;table as well as
formidable to that prince; and whil&s;t his re&s;entment again&s;t the &s;ee of
Rome had removed one con&s;iderable part of his early prejudices, he had made
it a point of honour never to relinqui&s;h the re&s;t. Separate as he &s;tood
from the catholic church, and from the Roman pontiff, the head of it, he
&s;till valued him&s;elf on maintaining the catholic doctrine, and on guarding,
by fire and &s;word, the imagined purity of his &s;peculative principles.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the mini|&s;ters.</NOTE> HENRY'S
mini&s;ters and courtiers were of as motley a character as his conduct; and
&s;eemed to waver, during this whole reign, between the ancient and the new
religion. The Queen, engaged by intere&s;t as well as inclination, favoured the
cau&s;e of the reformers: Cromwel, who was created &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and
who was every day advancing in the King's confidence, had embraced the &s;ame
views; and as he was a man of prudence and ability, he was able, very
effectually, tho' in a covert manner, to promote the late innovations: Cranmer,
archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, had &s;ecretly adopted the prote&s;tant tenets; and
he had gained Henry's friend&s;hip by his candour and &s;incerity; virtues
which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in as eminent a degree as tho&s;e times, equally
di&s;tracted with faction and oppre&s;&s;ed with tyran|ny, could ea&s;ily
permit. On the other hand, the duke of Norfolk adhered to <PB N="186" REF="191"> the ancient faith; and by the greatne&s;s of his rank, as well as by
his talents, both for peace and war, he had great weight in the King's council:
Gardiner, lately created bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, had inli&s;ted him&s;elf in
the &s;ame party; and the &s;upplene&s;s of his character, as well as the
dexterity of his conduct, had ren|dered him extremely u&s;eful to it.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e mini&s;ters, while they &s;tood in the mo&s;t
irreconcilable oppo&s;ition of principles, were obliged to di&s;gui&s;e their
particular opinions, and to pretend an entire agreement with the &s;entiments
of their ma&s;ter. Cromwel and Cranmer &s;till carried the appearance of a
conformity to the ancient &s;peculative tenets; but they artfully made u&s;e of
Henry's re&s;entment to widen the breach with the &s;ee of Rome. Norfolk and
Gardiner feigned an a&s;&s;ent to the King's &s;upremacy, and to his
renounciation of the &s;overeign pontiff; but they encouraged his pa&s;&s;ion
for the catholic faith, and in&s;tigated him to puni&s;h tho&s;e daring
heretics, who had pre&s;umed to reject his theological principles. Both &s;ides
hoped, by their unli|mited compliance, to bring him over to their party: The
King mean while, who held the ballance between the factions, was enabled, by
the court&s;hip payed him both by prote&s;tants and catholics, to a&s;&s;ume an
immea&s;urable authority: And tho' in all the&s;e mea&s;ures he was really
driven by his ungoverned humour, he ca&s;ually held a cour&s;e, which led more
certainly to arbitrary power, than any which the mo&s;t profound politics could
have traced out to him. Artifice, refinement, and hypocri&s;y, in his
&s;ituation, would have put both parties on their guard again&s;t him, and
would have taught them re&s;erve in complying with a monarch, whom they could
never hope thoroughly to have gained: But while the frankne&s;s, &s;incerity,
and openne&s;s of Henry's temper were generally known, as well as the dominion
of his furious pa&s;&s;ions; each &s;ide dreaded to lo&s;e him by the
&s;malle&s;t oppo&s;ition, and flattered them&s;elves that a blind compliance
with his will, would throw him, cordially and fully, into their
intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE ambiguity of the King's conduct, tho' it kept the courtiers
in awe, &s;erv|ed to encourage the prote&s;tant doctrine among his &s;ubjects,
and promoted that &s;pirit of innovation with which the age was generally
&s;eized, and which nothing but an entire uniformity, as well as a &s;teddy
&s;everity in the admini&s;tration, could be able to repre&s;s. There were
&s;ome Engli&s;hmen, Tindal, Joye, Con&s;tantine, and others, who, dreading the
exertion of the King's authority, had fled to Ant|werp<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 159.</NOTE>; where the great privileges

they did not exclude from this appel|lation the &s;ocial virtues, it was
&s;till the &s;uper&s;titions, gainful to the church, which they chiefly
extolled and recommended. The books, compo&s;ed by the&s;e fugi|tives, being
&s;tole over to England, began to make converts every where; but it was a
tran&s;lation of the &s;criptures by Tindal, that was e&s;teemed mo&s;t
dangerous to the e&s;tabli&s;hed faith. The fir&s;t edition of this work,
compo&s;ed with little ac|curacy, was found liable to con&s;iderable
objections; and Tindal, who was poor, and could not afford to lo&s;e a great
part of the impre&s;&s;ion, was longing for an op|portunity of correcting his
errors, of which he had been made &s;en&s;ible. Ton|&s;tal, then bi&s;hop of
London, &s;oon after of Durham, a man of great modera|tion, being de&s;irous to

orders for buying up all the copies, which could be found at Antwerp; and he
burnt them publicly in Cheap&s;ide. By this contrivance, he &s;upplied Tin|dal
with money, enabled him to print a new and correct edition of his work, and
gave occa&s;ion to great &s;candal and reproach, in thus committing to the
flames the word of God<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 186. Fox, vol.

<P>THE di&s;ciples of the reformation met with little &s;everity
during the mini&s;try of Wol&s;ey, who, tho' him&s;elf a clergyman, bore too
&s;mall regard to the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical order, to &s;erve as an in&s;trument
of their tyranny: It was even an article of impeachment again&s;t him<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Articles of impeach|ment in Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE>,
that by his connivance he had encouraged the growth of here&s;y, and that he
had protected and acquitted &s;ome notorious offend|ers. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Thomas More.</NOTE> Sir Thomas More, who
&s;ucceeded Wol&s;ey as chancellor, is at once an ob|ject de&s;erving our
compa&s;&s;ion, and an in&s;tance of the u&s;ual progre&s;s of men's
&s;en|timents during that age. This man, who&s;e elegant genius and familiar
acquaint|ance with the noble &s;pirit of antiquity, had given him very enlarged
&s;entiments, and who had in his early years advanced principles, which even at
pre&s;ent would <PB N="188" REF="193"> be e&s;teemed &s;omewhat libertine, had,
in the cour&s;e of events, been &s;o irritated by polemics, and thrown into
&s;uch a &s;uper&s;titious attachment to the ancient faith, that few
inqui&s;itors have been guilty of greater violence in their pro&s;ecutions of
here&s;y. Tho' adorned with the gentle&s;t manners, and the pure&s;t integrity,
he carried to the utmo&s;t height his aver&s;ion to heterodoxy; and one James
Bain|ham, in particular, a gentleman of the temple, experienced from him the
high|e&s;t &s;everity. Bainham, accu&s;ed of favouring the new opinions, was
carried to More's hou&s;e, and having refu&s;ed to di&s;cover his accomplices,
the chancellor or|dered him to be whipt in his pre&s;ence, and afterwards
&s;ent him to the Tower, where he him&s;elf &s;aw him put to the torture. The
unhappy gentleman, over|come by all the&s;e &s;everities, abjured his opinions;
but feeling afterwards the deepe&s;t compunction for this apo&s;tacy, he openly
returned to his former tenets, and even courted the crown of martyrdom. He was
condemned as an ob&s;tinate and relap&s;ed heretic, and was burned in
Smithfield<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox. Burnet, vol. I. p. 165.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MANY were brought into the bi&s;hops courts for offences, which
appear very trivial, but which were regarded as &s;ymbols of the party: Some
for teaching their children the Lord's prayer in Engli&s;h; others for reading
the new te&s;ta|ment in that language, or for &s;peaking again&s;t pilgrimages.
To harbour the per&s;ecuted preachers, to neglect the fa&s;ts of the church, to
declaim again&s;t the vices of the clergy, were capital offences. One Thomas
Bilney, a prie&s;t, who had embraced the new doctrine, had been terrified into
an abjuration; but was &s;o haunted by remor&s;e, that his friends dreaded
&s;ome fatal effects of his de&s;pair. At la&s;t, his mind &s;eemed to be more
compo&s;ed; but this appearing calm pro|ceeded only from the re&s;olution which
he had taken, of expiating his pa&s;t offence, by an open confe&s;&s;ion of the
truth, and by dying a martyr to it. He went thro' Norfolk, teaching every where
the people to beware of idolatry, and of tru&s;ting either to pilgrimages, or
to the cowle of St. Francis, to the prayers of the &s;aints, or to images. He
was &s;oon &s;eized, tried in the bi&s;hop's court, and condemn|ed as a
relap&s;e; and the writ was &s;ent down to burn him. When brought to the
&s;take, he di&s;covered &s;uch patience, fortitude, and devotion, that the
&s;pecta|tors were much affected with the horrors of his puni&s;hment; and
&s;ome mendi|cant friars, who were pre&s;ent, fearing that his death would be
imputed to them, and make them lo&s;e tho&s;e alms, which they received from
the charity of the peo|ple, de&s;ired him publicly to acquit them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 164.</NOTE>of having any hand in his death.
He very willingly complied; and by this meekne&s;s gained the more on the
&s;ympa|shy of the people. Another per&s;on, &s;till more heroic, being brought
to the &s;take for denying the real pre&s;ence, &s;eemed almo&s;t in a
tran&s;port of joy; and he <PB N="189" REF="194"> tenderly embraced the
faggots, which were to be the in&s;truments of his puni&s;h|ment, as the means
of procuring him eternal re&s;t. In &s;hort, the tide turning towards the new
doctrine, tho&s;e &s;evere executions, which, in another di&s;po&s;ition of
men's minds, would have &s;ufficed to &s;uppre&s;s it, now &s;erved only the
more to diffu&s;e it among the people, and to in&s;pire them with horror
again&s;t the unre|lenting per&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Henry neglected not to puni&s;h the prote&s;tant
doctrine, which he e&s;teemed here&s;y, his mo&s;t formidable enemies, he knew,
were the zealous ad|herents to the ancient religion, chiefly the monks, who,
having their immediate dependance on the Roman pontiff, apprehended their own
ruin to be the cer|tain con&s;equence of aboli&s;hing his authority in England.
Peyto, a friar, preach|ing before the King, had the a&s;&s;urance to tell him, 
<Q REND="inline">"That many lying prophets had deceived him, but
he, as a true Micajah, warned him, that the dogs would lick his blood, as they
had done Ahab's<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p.
167.</NOTE>."</Q> The King took no notice of this in&s;ult; but allowed the
preacher to depart in peace. Next Sunday, he employed Dr. Corren to preach
before him; who ju&s;tified the King's proceed|ings, and gave Peyto the
appellations of a rebel, a &s;landerer, a dog, and a tray|tor. El&s;ton,
another friar of the &s;ame hou&s;e, interrupted the preacher; and told him,
that he was one of the lying prophets, who &s;ought by adultery to
e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown; but that he him&s;elf would
ju&s;tify all that Peyto had &s;aid. Henry &s;ilenced this petulant friar; but
&s;howed no other mark of re&s;ent|ment than ordering Peyto and him to be
&s;ummoned before the council, and to be rebuked for their offence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p. 86. Burnet, vol. I. p.
151.</NOTE>. He even bore patiently &s;ome new in&s;tances of their ob&s;tinacy
and arrogance. For when the earl of E&s;&s;ex, a privy coun&s;ellor, told them,
that they de&s;erved for their offence to be thrown into the Thames; El&s;ton
replied, that the road to heaven lay as near by water as by land<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Stow, p. 562.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT &s;everal monks were detected in a con&s;piracy, which, as
it might have proved more dangerous to the King, was attended with more fatal
con&s;equences to them&s;elves. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Maid of Kent.</NOTE> Elizabeth Barton, of
Aldington in Kent, commonly called the <HI>holy Maid of Kent,</HI> had been
&s;ubject to hy&s;terical fits, which threw her body into unu&s;ual
convul&s;ions; and having produced an equal di&s;order in her mind, made her
utter &s;trange &s;ayings, which, as &s;he was &s;carce con&s;cious of them
during the time, had &s;oon after entirely e&s;caped her memory. The &s;illy
people in the neighbourhood were &s;truck with the&s;e appearances, which they
imagined to be &s;upernatural; and Richard Ma&s;ters, vicar of the pari&s;h, a
de&s;igning fellow, <PB N="190" REF="195"> founded on them a project, by which
he hoped to draw both profit and con&s;idera|tion to him&s;elf. He went to
Warham, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who was at that time alive; and having
given him an account of Elizabeth's revelations, he &s;o far wrought on that
prudent, but &s;uper&s;titious prelate, as to receive orders from him to watch
her in her-trances, and to note down carefully all her future &s;peeches. The
regard paid her by a per&s;on of &s;o high a rank, &s;oon rendered her &s;till
more the object of attention to the neighbourhood; and it was ea&s;y for
Ma&s;ters to per&s;uade them, as well as the maid her&s;elf, that her ravings
were in&s;pirations of the Holy Gho&s;t. Knavery, as is u&s;ual, &s;oon after
&s;ucceeding to illu&s;ion, &s;he learned to counterfeit trances; and &s;he
then uttered, in an unu&s;ual tone of voice, &s;uch &s;peeches as were dictated
to her by her &s;piritual director. Ma&s;ters a&s;&s;ociated with him Dr.
Bocking, a canon of Canterbury; and their de&s;ign was to rai&s;e the credit of
an image of the virgin, which &s;tood in a chapel belonging to Ma|&s;ters, and
to draw &s;uch pilgrimages to it as u&s;ually frequented the more famous images
and relicts. In pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign, Elizabeth pretended
revela|tions, which directed her to have recour&s;e to that image for a cure;
and being brought before it, in the pre&s;ence of a great multitude, &s;he fell
anew into convul|&s;ions; and after di&s;torting her limbs and countenance
during a competent time, &s;he affected to have obtained a perfect recovery by
the interce&s;&s;ion of the virgin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 570.

of more important enterprizes. They taught their peni|tent to declaim again&s;t
the new doctrines, which &s;he denominated here&s;y; again&s;t innovations in
eccle&s;ia&s;tical government; and again&s;t the King's divorce from Catherine.
She went &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ert, that, if he pro&s;ecuted that de&s;ign, and
married another, he would not be a King a month longer, and would not an hour
longer po&s;&s;e&s;s the favour of the Almighty, but &s;hould die the death of
a villain. Many monks throughout England, either from folly, or roguery, or
from faction, which is often a complication of both, entered into this
delu&s;ion; and one Deering, a friar, wrote a book of the revelations and
prophecies of Eli|zabeth<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol I. p.
181.</NOTE>. Miracles were daily added, to encrea&s;e the wonder; and the
pulpit every where re&s;ounded with accounts of the &s;anctity and
in&s;pirations of this new prophete&s;s. Me&s;&s;ages were carried from her to
Queen Catherine, by which that prince&s;s was exhorted to per&s;i&s;t in her
oppo&s;ition to the divorce; the pope's am|ba&s;&s;adors gave encouragement to
the popular credulity; and even Fi&s;her, bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, tho' a man
of &s;en&s;e and learning, was carried away with an opinion 
<PB N="191" REF="196"> &s;o favourable to the party, which he had embraced<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p. 87.</NOTE>. The King at la&s;t
began to think the matter worthy of his attention; and having ordered Elizabeth
and her accomplices to be arre&s;ted, he brought them before the
&s;tar-chamber, where they freely, without being put to the torture, made
confe&s;&s;ion of their guilt. The Parliament, in the &s;e&s;&s;ion held the
beginning of this year, pa&s;&s;ed an act of at|tainder again&s;t &s;ome who
were engaged in this trea&s;onable impo&s;ture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">25 Hen.

her&s;elf, Ma&s;ters, Bocking, Deering, Rich, Ri&s;by, Gold, &s;uffered for
their crime. The bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, Abel, Addi&s;on, Laurence, and &s;ome
others, were condemned for mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on; becau&s;e they had not
di&s;covered &s;ome cri|minal &s;peeches which they heard from Elizabeth<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Godwin's Annals, p. 53.</NOTE>: And they were thrown into
pri&s;on. The better to undeceive the multitude, the forgery of many of the
pro|phete&s;s's miracles was detected; and even the &s;candalous pro&s;titution
of her man|ners was laid open to the public. Tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;o
naturally in&s;inuate them&s;elves amid&s;t the warm intimacies maintained by
the devotees of different &s;exes, had taken place between Elizabeth and her
confederates; and it was found, that a door to her dormitory, which was &s;aid
to have been miraculou&s;ly opened, in order to give her acce&s;s to the
chapel, for the &s;ake of frequent conver&s;e with heaven, had been contrived
by Bocking and Ma&s;ters for le&s;s refined purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1535" UNIT="year"> THE detection of an
impo&s;ture, attended with &s;o many odious circum&s;tances, hurt much the
credit of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, particularly of the monks, and in&s;tigated
the King to take vengeance on them. He &s;uppre&s;&s;ed three mona&s;teries of
the Ob&s;ervantine friars; and finding that little clamor was excited by this
act of power, he was the more encouraged to lay his rapacious hands on the
re&s;t. Mean|while, he exerci&s;ed puni&s;hment on individuals, who were
obnoxious to him. The Parliament had made it trea&s;on to endeavour the
depriving the King of his dignity or titles: They had lately added to his other
titles, that of &s;upreme head of the church: It was inferred, that to deny his
&s;upremacy was trea&s;on; and many priors and eccle&s;ia&s;tics lo&s;t their
lives for this new &s;pecies of crime. It was certainly a high in&s;tance of
tyranny to make the mere delivery of a political opi|nion, e&s;pecially one
that no way affected the King's temporal right, to be a capi|tal offence, tho'
attended with no overt act; and the Parliament, in pa&s;&s;ing this law, had
overlooked all the principles by which a civilized, much more a free people,
&s;hould be governed: But the violence of changing &s;o &s;uddenly the whole
&s;y&s;tem of government, and the making it trea&s;on to deny what, during many
ages, it had been here&s;y to a&s;&s;ert, is an event which may appear
&s;omewhat extra|ordinary. Even the &s;tern, unrelenting mind of Henry was, at
fir&s;t, &s;hocked <PB N="192" REF="197"> with the&s;e &s;anguinary mea&s;ures;
and he went &s;o far as to change his garb and dre&s;s, pretending &s;orrow for
the nece&s;&s;ity, by which he was pu&s;hed to &s;uch extremi|ties. Still
impelled, however, by his violent temper, and de&s;irous of &s;triking a terror
into the whole nation, he proceeded, by making examples of Fi&s;her and More,
to con&s;ummate his lawle&s;s tyranny.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and ex|ecution of Fi&s;her, bi|&s;hop

King. When he was thrown into pri&s;on, on account of his refu&s;ing the oath
of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and his concealment of Elizabeth Barton's trea&s;onable
&s;peeches, he had not only been deprived of all his revenues, but &s;tripped
of his very cloaths, and, without con&s;ideration of his extreme age, was
allowed nothing but rags, which &s;carce &s;ufficed to cover his
nakedne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuller's Church Hi&s;t. book 5. p.

the pope, wil|ling to recompen&s;e the &s;ufferings of &s;o faithful an
adherent, created him a cardi|nal; tho' Fi&s;her was &s;o carele&s;s of that
dignity, that even if the purple were lying on the ground, he declared that he
would not &s;toop to take it. This pro|motion of a man, merely for his
oppo&s;ition to royal authority, rouzed the in|dignation of the King; and he
re&s;olved to make the innocent per&s;on feel the effects of his re&s;entment. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of June.</NOTE> Fi&s;her was indicted for

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Sir Tho|mas More.</NOTE> THE execution of
this prelate was intended as a warning to More, who&s;e com|pliance, on account
of his great authority both abroad and at home, and his high reputation for
learning and virtue, was anxiou&s;ly de&s;ired by the King. That prince al&s;o
bore as great per&s;onal affection and regard to More, as his im|perious mind,
the &s;port of pa&s;&s;ions, was &s;u&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eptible of towards a man, who in any particular, oppo&s;ed his
violent inclinations. But More could never be pre|vailed on, contrary to his
principles, to acknowledge the King's &s;upremacy; and tho' Henry exacted that
compliance from the whole nation, there was, as yet, no law obliging any one to
take an oath to that purpo&s;e. Rich, the &s;ollicitor general, was &s;ent to
confer with More, then a pri&s;oner, who kept a cautious &s;ilence with regard
to the &s;upremacy: He was only inveigled to &s;ay, that any que&s;tion with
regard to the law, which e&s;tabli&s;hed that prerogative, was like a two-edged
&s;word: If a per&s;on an&s;wer one way, it will confound his &s;oul; if
ano|ther, it will de&s;troy his body. No more was wanted to found an indictment
of high trea&s;on again&s;t the pri&s;oner. His &s;ilence was called malicious,
and made a part of his crime; and the&s;e words, which had ca&s;ually dropped
from him, <PB N="193" REF="198"> were interpreted as a denial of the
&s;upremacy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">More's Life of Sir Thomas More. Herbert, p.

&s;entence again&s;t More, who had long expected this fate, and who needed no

con&s;tancy, but even his cheerfulne&s;s, nay, his u&s;ual face|tiou&s;ne&s;s,
never for&s;ook him; and he made a &s;acrifice of his life to his integrity

<P>WHEN the execution of Fi&s;her and More was reported at Rome,
e&s;pecially that of the former, who was inve&s;ted with the dignity of
cardinal, every one di&s;|covered the mo&s;t violent rage again&s;t the King;
and numerous libels were pub|li&s;hed, by the wits and orators of Italy,
comparing him to Caligula, Nero, Do|mitian, and all the mo&s;t unrelenting
tyrants of antiquity. Clement the &s;eventh had died about &s;ix months after
he pronounced &s;entence again&s;t the King; and Paul the third, of the name of
Farne&s;e, had &s;ucceeded to the papal throne. This pontiff, who had always
favoured Henry's cau&s;e while a cardinal, had hoped, that, per&s;onal
animo&s;ities being buried with his predece&s;&s;ors, it might not be
impo&s;&s;ible to form an agreement with England: And Henry him&s;elf was &s;o
de&s;irous of accommodating matters, that in a negotiation, which he entered
into with Francis a little before this time, he required, that that monarch
&s;hould con|ciliate a friend&s;hip between him and the court of Rome. But
Henry was ac|cu&s;tomed to pre&s;cribe, not to receive terms; and even while he
was negotiating peace, his u&s;ual violence often carried him to commit
offences, which rendered the quarrel totally incurable. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th Augu&s;t.</NOTE> The execution of
Fi&s;her was regarded by Paul, as &s;o capital an injury, that he immediately
pa&s;&s;ed cen&s;ures again&s;t the King, citing him and all his adherents to
appear in Rome within ninety days, in order to an&s;wer for their crimes: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">King excom|municated.</NOTE> If they failed,

the nobility to take arms again&s;t him; freed <PB N="194" REF="199"> his
&s;ubjects from all oaths of allegiance; cut off their commerce with foreign
&s;tates; and declared it lawful for any one to &s;eize them, to make &s;laves

pa&s;&s;ed, they were not at that time openly denounced: The pope delayed the

de&s;perate; and till the emperor, who was at pre&s;ent pre&s;&s;ed by the
Turks and the prote|&s;tant princes in Germany, &s;hould be in a condition to
execute the cen&s;ures.</P>
<P>THE King knew, that he might expect any injury, which it
&s;hould be in Charles's power to inflict; and he therefore made it the chief
object of his policy to incapacitate that monarch from wreaking his
re&s;entment upon him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 350,

for marrying his infant-daughter, Elizabeth, with the duke of Angouleme, third

league in Germany, who were ever jealous of the emperor's ambition: And Henry,
be&s;ides remit|ing them &s;ome money, &s;ent Fox, bi&s;hop of Hereford, as
Francis did Bellay, lord of Langey, to treat with tho&s;e princes. But during
the fir&s;t fervours of the reformation, an agreement in theological tenets was
held, as well as an union of intere&s;t, to be e&s;&s;ential to a good
corre&s;pondence among &s;tates; and tho' both Francis and Henry flattered the
German princes with hopes of their embracing the confe&s;&s;ion of Au&s;bourg,
it was looked upon as a bad &s;ymptom of their &s;incerity, that they
exerci&s;ed &s;uch extreme rigour again&s;t all preachers of the reformation in
their re&s;pective dominions<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sleidan, lib.

the fir&s;t theologian in the world, he yet invited over Melancthon, Bucer,
Sturmius, Draco, and other German divines, in order to confer with him, and to
in&s;truct him in the foundation of their tenets. The&s;e theologi|ans were now
of great importance in the world; and no poet or philo&s;opher, even in antient
Greece, where they were treated with mo&s;t re&s;pect, had ever reached equal
applau&s;e and admiration with the&s;e wretched compo&s;ers of meta|phy&s;ical
polemics. The German princes told the King, that they could not &s;pare their
divines; and as Henry had no hopes of agreement with &s;uch zealous
di&s;putants, and knew that in Germany the followers of Luther would not
a&s;&s;o|ciate with the di&s;ciples of Zuinglius, becau&s;e, tho' they agreed
in every thing el&s;e, they differed in &s;ome particulars with regard to the
euchari&s;t, he was the more indifferent on account of this refu&s;al. He could

<P><MILESTONE N="1536" UNIT="year"> DURING the&s;e negotiations an
incident happened in England, which promi&s;ed a more amicable conclu&s;ion of

told him, that as the hour of her death was now approaching, &s;he laid hold of
this la&s;t opportunity to inculcate on him the importance of his religious

<P>THE emperor thought, that as the decea&s;e of his aunt had
removed all foun|dation for per&s;onal animo&s;ity between him and Henry, it
might not now be impo&s;&s;ible to detach him from the alliance of France, and
renew that confederacy with England from which he had formerly reaped &s;o much
advantage. He &s;ent Henry propo&s;als for a return to ancient amity, upon
the&s;e conditions<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Du Bellay, liv&punc; 5.
Herbert. Burnet, vol. 3. in Coll. N^o 50.</NOTE>; that he &s;hould be
reconciled to the pope, that he &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his war with the
Turk, and that he &s;hould take party with him again&s;t Francis, who now
threatened the dutchy of Milan. The King replied, that he was willing to be on
good terms with the emperor, provided he would acknowledge, that the for|mer
breach of friend&s;hip came entirely from him&s;elf: As to the conditions
pro|po&s;ed; the proceedings again&s;t the bi&s;hop of Rome were &s;o ju&s;t,
and &s;o fully ratified by the Parliament of England, that they could not now
be revoked; when chri&s;tian princes &s;hould have &s;ettled peace among
them&s;elves, he would <PB N="196" REF="201"> not fail exert that vigour, which
became him, again&s;t the enemies of the faith; and after amity with the
emperor was once fully re&s;tored, he would then be in a &s;ituation, as a
common friend both to him and Francis, either to medi|ate an agreement between
them, or to a&s;&s;i&s;t the injured party.</P>
<P>WHAT rendered Henry more indifferent to the advances made by the
emperor, was his experience of the u&s;ual duplicity and in&s;incerity of that
monarch, and the intelligence which he received of the pre&s;ent tran&s;actions
in Europe. Francis Sforza, duke of Milan, was dead without i&s;&s;ue; and the
em|peror maintained, that the dutchy, being a fief of the empire, was devolved
to him, as the head of the Germanic body: Not to give umbrage, however, to the
&s;tates of Italy, he profe&s;&s;ed his intention of be&s;towing that
principality on &s;ome prince, who &s;hould be obnoxious to no party, and he
even made offer of it to the duke of Angouleme, third &s;on to Francis. The
French monarch, who pretended that his own right to Milan was now revived upon
Sforza's death, was contented to &s;ub&s;titute his &s;econd &s;on, the duke of
Orleans, in his place; and the emperor pretended to clo&s;e with this
propo&s;al. But his &s;ole intention in that liberal conce&s;&s;ion was to gain
time, till he &s;hould put him&s;elf in a warlike po&s;ture, and be able to
carry an inva&s;ion into Francis's dominions. The antient enmity between
the&s;e princes broke out anew in bravadoes, and in per&s;onal in|&s;ults on
each other, not becoming per&s;ons of their rank, and &s;till le&s;s &s;uitable
to men of &s;uch unque&s;tioned bravery. Charles &s;oon after invaded Provence
in per&s;on, with an army of fifty thou&s;and men; but met with no &s;ucce&s;s.
His army peri&s;hed with &s;ickne&s;s, fatigue, famine, and other
di&s;a&s;ters; and he was obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Mar&s;eilles, and
retire into Italy with the broken re|mains of his forces. An army of
imperiali&s;ts, near 30,000 &s;trong, which in|vaded France on the &s;ide of
the Netherlands, and laid &s;iege to Peronne, made no greater progre&s;s, but
retired upon the approach of a French army. And Henry had thus the
&s;atisfaction to find, both that his ally, Francis, was likely to &s;upport
him&s;elf without foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that his own tranquillity was
fully en&s;ured by the&s;e violent wars and animo&s;ities on the continent.</P>
<P>IF any inquietude remained with the Engli&s;h court, it was
&s;olely occa&s;ioned by the &s;tate of affairs in Scotland. James, hearing of
the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of his ally, Francis, very generou&s;ly levied
&s;ome forces; and embarking them on board ve&s;&s;els, which he had hired for
that purpo&s;e, landed them &s;afely in France. He even came over in per&s;on;
and making ha&s;te to join the French King's camp, which then lay in Provence,
and to partake of his danger, he met that prince at Lyons, who, having
repul&s;ed the emperor's inva&s;ion, was now return|ing to his capital.
Recommended by &s;o agreeable and &s;ea&s;onable an in&s;tance of 
<PB N="197" REF="202"> friend&s;hip, the King of Scots made &s;uit to Magdalen,
daughter to the French monarch, who had no other &s;cruple in agreeing to the
match, than what was de|rived from the infirm &s;tate of his daughter's health,
which &s;eemed to threaten her with an approaching end. But James having gained
the affections of the prince&s;s, and obtained her con&s;ent, the father would
no longer oppo&s;e the united de&s;ires of his daughter and friend; and they
were accordingly married, and &s;oon after &s;et &s;ail for Scotland, where the
young Queen, as was fore&s;een, died in a little time after her arrival.
Francis, however, was afraid, le&s;t his ally, Henry, whom he likewi&s;e looked
on as his friend, and who lived with him on a more cordial footing than is
u&s;ual among great princes, &s;hould be di&s;plea&s;ed that this clo&s;e
confederacy between France and Scotland was concluded without his
par|ticipation. He therefore di&s;patched Pommeraye to London, in order to
apolo|gize for this mea&s;ure; but Henry, with his u&s;ual openne&s;s and
freedom, ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;uch di&s;plea&s;ure, that he refu&s;ed even to
confer with the amba&s;&s;ador; and Francis was apprehen&s;ive of a rupture
with a prince, who regulated his mea&s;ures more by humour and pa&s;&s;ion than
by the rules of political prudence. But Henry was &s;o fettered by the
oppo&s;ition, in which he was engaged again&s;t the pope and the emperor, that
he pur&s;ued no farther this di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t Francis; and in the end
every thing remained in tranquillity both on the &s;ide of France and
Scotland.</P>
<P>THE dome&s;tic peace of England &s;eemed to be expo&s;ed to more
hazard, by the violent innovations in religion; and it may be affirmed, that,
in this dangerous conjuncture, nothing en&s;ured public tranquillity &s;o much
as the deci&s;ive authority acquired by the King, and his great a&s;cendant
over all his &s;ubjects. Not only the devotion paid the crown, was profound
during that age: The per&s;onal re|&s;pect, in&s;pired by Henry, was
con&s;iderable; and even the terrors, with which he over-awed every one, were
not attended with any con&s;iderable degree of hatred. His frankne&s;s, his
&s;incerity, his magnificence, his genero&s;ity, were vir|tues which
counterballanced his violence, cruelty, and impetuo&s;ity. And the important
rank, which his vigour, more than addre&s;s, acquired him in all foreign
negotiations, flattered the vanity of Engli&s;hmen, and made them the more
willingly endure tho&s;e dome&s;tic hard&s;hips, to which they were expo&s;ed.
The King, con&s;cious of his advantages, was now proceeding to the mo&s;t
dangerous trial of his authority; and after paving the way for that mea&s;ure
by &s;everal expe|dients, he was at la&s;t determined to &s;uppre&s;s the
mona&s;teries, and to put him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ample
revenues.</P>
<P>THE great encrea&s;e of mona&s;teries, if matters be
con&s;idered merely in a politi|cal light, will appear the radical
inconvenience of the catholic religion; and every <PB N="198" REF="203"> other
di&s;advantage, attending that communion, &s;eems to have an in&s;eparable
con|nection with the&s;e religious in&s;titutions. Papal u&s;urpations, the
tyranny of the in|qui&s;ition, the multiplication of holidays; all the&s;e
letters on liberty and indu&s;try, were ultimately derived from the authority
and in&s;inuation of monks, who being &s;cattered every where, proved &s;o many
colonies of &s;uper&s;tition and of folly. This order of men were extremely
enraged again&s;t Henry; and regarded the abolition of the papal authority in
England, as the removal of the &s;ole protec|tion which they enjoyed again&s;t
the rapacity of the crown and of the courtiers. They were now &s;ubjected to
the King's vi&s;itation; the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;acredne&s;s of their bulls from
Rome was rejected; the progre&s;s of the reformation abroad, which had every
where been attended with the abolition of the mona&s;tic &s;tate, gave them
rea&s;on to expect like con&s;equences in England; and tho' the King &s;till
maintained the ancient doctrine of purgatory, to which mo&s;t of the convents
owed their origin and &s;upport, it was fore&s;een, that, in the progre&s;s of
the con|te&s;t, he would every day be led to depart wider from antient
in&s;titutions, and be drawn nearer the tenets of the reformers, with whom his
political intere&s;ts natu|rally induced him to ally him&s;elf. Moved by
the&s;e con&s;iderations, the friars made u&s;e of all their influence to
enflame the people again&s;t the King's government; and Henry, finding their
&s;afety irreconcilable with his own, was determined to &s;eize the pre&s;ent
opportunity, and utterly de&s;troy his declared enemies.</P>
<P>CROMWEL, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, had been appointed
vicar-general, or vicege|rent, a new office, by which the King's &s;upremacy,
or the ab&s;olute, uncontroul|able power a&s;&s;umed over the church, was
delegated to him. He employed Lay|ton, London, Price, Gage, Petre, Bella&s;is,
and others, as commi&s;&s;ioners, who carried on, every where, a rigorous
enquiry with regard to the conduct and de|portment of all the friars. During
times of faction, e&s;pecially of the religious kind, no equity is to be
expected from adver&s;aries; and as it was known, that the King's intention in
this vi&s;itation, was to find a pretence for aboli&s;hing mo|na&s;teries, we
may naturally conclude, that the reports of the commi&s;&s;ioners are very
little to be relied on. Friars were encouraged to bring in informations
again&s;t their brethren; the &s;lighte&s;t evidence was credited; and even the
calum|nies &s;pread abroad by the friends to the reformation, were regarded as
grounds of proof. Mon&s;trous di&s;orders are therefore &s;aid to have been
found in many of the religious hou&s;es: Whole convents of women abandoned to
lewdne&s;s: Signs of abortions procured, of infants murdered, of unnatural
lu&s;ts between per&s;ons of the &s;ame &s;ex. It is indeed probable, that the
blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the people, during tho&s;e ages, would render the
friars and nuns more unguarded, and more di&s;&s;olute, than they are in any
roman catholic country at pre&s;ent: But &s;till, the <PB N="199" REF="204">
reproaches, which it is &s;afe&s;t to credit, are &s;uch as point at vices,
naturally con|nected with the very in&s;titution of convents, and with the
mona&s;tic life. The cruel and inveterate factions and quarrels therefore which
the commi&s;&s;ioners mentioned, are very credible, among men, who, being
confined together within the &s;ame walls, never can forget their mutual
animo&s;ities, and who, being cut off from all the mo&s;t endearing connections
of nature, are commonly cur&s;ed with hearts more &s;elfi&s;h, and tempers more
unrelenting, than fall to the &s;hare of other men. The pious frauds,
practi&s;ed to increa&s;e the devotion and liberality of the people, may be
regarded as certain, in an order founded on illu&s;ions, lies, and
&s;uper&s;tition. The &s;upine idlene&s;s, al&s;o, and its attendant, profound
ignorance, with which the convents were reproached, admit of no que&s;tion; and
tho' monks were the true pre&s;ervers, as well as inventors, of the dreaming
and captious philo&s;ophy of the &s;chools, no manly or elegant knowledge could
be expected among men, who&s;e life, condemned to a tedious uniformity, and
deprived of all emulation, afforded nothing to rai&s;e the mind, or cultivate
the genius.</P>
<P>SOME few mona&s;teries, terrified with this rigorous
inqui&s;ition carried on by Cromwel and his commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;urrendered
their revenues into the King's hands; and the monks received &s;mall pen&s;ions
as the reward of their ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s. Orders were given to di&s;mi&s;s
&s;uch nuns and friars as were below four and twenty, and who&s;e vows were, on
that account, &s;uppo&s;ed not to be binding. The doors of the convents were
opened, even to &s;uch as were above that age; and all tho&s;e recovered their
liberty who de&s;ired it. But as all the&s;e expedients did not fully an&s;wer
the King's purpo&s;e, he had recour&s;e to his u&s;ual in&s;trument of power,
the Parliament; and in order to prepare men for the innovations projected, the
report of the vi&s;itors was publi&s;hed, and a general horror was endeavoured
to be excited in the nation again&s;t in&s;titutions which, to their
ance&s;tors, had been the objects of the mo&s;t profound veneration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4 February.</NOTE>

<P>THE act formerly pa&s;&s;ed, empowering the King to name

<P>THE commons, &s;en&s;ible that they had gained nothing by
oppo&s;ing the King's will, when he formerly endeavoured to &s;ecure the
profits of ward&s;hips and li|veries, were now contented to frame a law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">27 Hen. VIII. c. 10.</NOTE>, &s;uch as he dictated to them.
It was enacted, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of land &s;hall be adjudged to be

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14 April.</NOTE> AFTER all the&s;e laws were
pa&s;&s;ed, the King di&s;&s;olved the Parliament; a Par|liament memorable, not
only for the great and important innovations which it introduced, but al&s;o
for the long time it had &s;at, and the frequent proroga|tions which it had
undergone. Henry had found it &s;o ob&s;equious to his will, that he did not
chu&s;e, during the&s;e religious ferments, to hazard a new election; and he
continued the &s;ame Parliament above &s;ix years: A practice, at that time,
quite unprecedented in England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A convoca|tion.</NOTE> THE convocation, which
&s;at during this &s;e&s;&s;ion, were engaged in a very im|portant work, the
deliberating on the new tran&s;lation which was projected of the &s;criptures.
Tindal had formerly given a tran&s;lation, and it had been greedily read by the
people; but as the clergy complained of it, as very inaccurate and unfaithful,
it was now propo&s;ed that they &s;hould them&s;elves publi&s;h a
tran&s;lation, which would not be liable to tho&s;e objections. The friends of
the reformation a&s;&s;erted, that nothing could be more ab&s;urd than to
conceal, in an unknown <PB N="201" REF="206"> tongue, the word it&s;elf of God,
and thus to counteract the will of heaven, which, for the purpo&s;e of
univer&s;al &s;alvation, had publi&s;hed that &s;alutary doctrine to all
nations: That if this practice was not very ab&s;urd, the artifice at lea&s;t
was very barefaced, and proved a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that the glo&s;&s;es and
traditions of the cler|gy &s;tood in direct oppo&s;ition to the original text,
dictated by Supreme Intelli|gence: That it was now nece&s;&s;ary for the
people, &s;o long abu&s;ed by intere&s;ted preten&s;ions, to &s;ee with their
own eyes, and to examine whether the claims of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics were
founded on that charter, which was on all hands acknow|ledged to be derived
from heaven: And that as a &s;pirit of re&s;earch and curio&s;ity was happily
revived, and men were now obliged to make a choice among the preten&s;ions of
different &s;ects, the proper materials for deci&s;ion, and above all, the holy
&s;criptures, &s;hould be &s;et before them, and the revealed will of God,
which the change of language had &s;omewhat ob&s;cured, be again, by their
means, re|vealed to mankind.</P>
<P>THE favourers of the ancient religion maintained, on the other
hand, that the pretence of making the people &s;ee with their own eyes, was a
mere cheat, and was it&s;elf a very barefaced artifice, by which the new
preachers hoped to obtain the guidance of them, and &s;educe them from tho&s;e
pa&s;tors, whom the laws, whom ancient e&s;tabli&s;hments, whom heaven it&s;elf
had appointed for their &s;piri|tual direction: That the people were, by their
ignorance, their &s;tupidity, their nece&s;&s;ary avocations, totally
unqualified to choo&s;e their own principles, and it was a mocquery to &s;et
materials before them, of which they could not po&s;&s;ibly make any proper
u&s;e: That even in the affairs of common life, and in their temporal concerns,
which lay more within the compa&s;s of human rea&s;on, the laws had, in a great
mea&s;ure, deprived them of the right of private judgment, and had, happily,
for their own and the public intere&s;t, regulated their conduct and behaviour:
That theological que&s;tions were placed much beyond the &s;phere of vulgar
comprehen&s;ion; and eccle&s;ia&s;tics them&s;elves, tho' a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all
the advantages of education, erudition, and an a&s;&s;iduous &s;tudy of the
&s;cience, could not be fully a&s;&s;ured of a ju&s;t deci&s;ion; except by the
promi&s;e made them in &s;crip|ture, that God would be ever pre&s;ent with his
church, and that the gates of hell &s;hould not prevail again&s;t her: That the
gro&s;s errors adopted by the wi&s;e&s;t heathens, proved how unfit men were to
grope their own way, thro' this pro|found darkne&s;s; nor would the
&s;criptures, if tru&s;ted to every man's judgment, be able to remedy; on the
contrary, they would much augment, the&s;e fatal illu|&s;ions: That &s;acred
writ it&s;elf was involved in &s;o much ob&s;curity, was expo&s;ed to &s;o many
difficulties, contained &s;o many appearing contradictions, that it was the
mo&s;t dangerous weapon which could be intru&s;ted into the hands of the
ignorant <PB N="202" REF="207"> and giddy multitude: That the poetical
&s;pirit, in which a great part of it was compo&s;ed, at the &s;ame time that
it occa&s;ioned uncertainty in the &s;en&s;e, by its multi|plied tropes and
figures, was &s;ufficient to kindle the zeal of fanatici&s;m, and there|by
throw civil &s;ociety into the mo&s;t furious combu&s;tion: That a thou&s;and
&s;ects mu&s;t ari&s;e, which would pretend, each of them, to derive its tenets
from the &s;cripture; and would be able, by &s;pecious arguments, or even
without &s;pecious arguments, to &s;educe &s;illy women, and ignorant
mechanics, into a belief of the mo&s;t mon&s;trous principles: And that if ever
this di&s;order, dangerous to the magi&s;trate him&s;elf, received a remedy, it
mu&s;t be from the tacit acquie&s;cence of the people in &s;ome new authority;
and it was evidently better, without farther conte&s;t or enquiry, to adhere
peaceably to ancient, and therefore the more &s;ecure e&s;tabli&s;hments.</P>
<P>THESE latter arguments being more agreeable to
eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, would probably have prevailed in the
convocation, had it not been for the autho|rity of Cranmer, Latimer, and &s;ome
other bi&s;hops, who were &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak the King's &s;en&s;e of the
matter. A vote was pa&s;&s;ed for publi&s;hing a new tran&s;la|tion of the
&s;criptures; and in three years time this great work was fini&s;hed, and
printed at Paris. This was deemed a great point gained by the reformers; and a
con&s;iderable advancement of their cau&s;e. Farther progre&s;s was &s;oon
expected, after &s;uch important &s;ucce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT while the retainers to the new religion were triumphing in
their pro&s;pe|rity, they met with a mortification, which &s;eemed to bla&s;t
all their hopes: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;grace of Q. Anne.</NOTE> Their
patrone&s;s, Anne Boleyn, lo&s;t the King's favour, and &s;oon after her life,
from the rage of that furious monarch. Henry had per&s;evered con&s;tantly in
his love to this lady, during &s;ix years that his pro&s;ecution of the divorce
la&s;ted; and the more ob&s;tacles he met with to the gratification of his
pa&s;&s;ion, the more deter|mined zeal did he exert in pur&s;uing his
purpo&s;e. But the affection which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;o long under
difficulties, had no &s;ooner attained &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its
object, than it langui&s;hed from &s;atiety; and the King's heart was
apparently ali|enated from his con&s;ort. Anne's enemies &s;oon perceived this
fatal change; and they were very forward to widen the breach, when they found
that they incurred no danger by interpo&s;ing in tho&s;e delicate concerns. She
had brought forth a dead &s;on; and Henry's extreme fondne&s;s for male
i&s;&s;ue being thus, for the pre|&s;ent, di&s;appointed, his temper, equally
violent and &s;uper&s;titious, was di&s;|po&s;ed to make the innocent mother
an&s;werable for this misfortune<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol I. p.
19<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. But the chief means
which Anne's enemies employed to enflame the King again&s;t her, was his
jealou&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="208"> ANNE, tho' &s;he appears to have been
entirely innocent, and even virtuous, in her conduct, had a certain gaiety, if
not levity, of character, which threw her off her guard, and made her le&s;s
circum&s;pect than her &s;ituation required. Her education in France rendered
her the more prone to the&s;e freedoms; and it was with difficulty &s;he
conformed her&s;elf to that &s;trict ceremonial which was practi&s;ed in the
court of England. More vain than haughty, &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ee the
in|fluence of her beauty on all around her, and &s;he indulged her&s;elf in an
ea&s;y fa|miliarity with per&s;ons, who were formerly her equals, and who might
then have pretended to her friend&s;hip and good graces. Henry's dignity was
offended with the&s;e popular manners; and tho' the lover had been entirely
blind, the hu&s;band po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but too quick di&s;cernment and
penetration. Wicked in&s;truments interpo|&s;ed, and put a malignant
interpretation on the harmle&s;s liberties of the Queen: The vi&s;counte&s;s of
Rocheford, in particular, who was married to the Queen's brother, but who lived
on bad terms with her &s;i&s;ter-in-law, in&s;inuated the mo&s;t cruel
&s;u&s;|picions into the King's mind; and as &s;he was a woman of a very
profligate cha|racter, &s;he paid no regard either to truth or humanity in
tho&s;e calumnies which &s;he &s;ugge&s;ted. She pretended, that her own
hu&s;band was engaged in a criminal corre&s;pondence with his &s;i&s;ter; and
not contented with this imputation, &s;he poi|&s;oned every action of the
Queen, and repre&s;ented each in&s;tance of favour which &s;he conferred on any
one, as a token of affection. Henry Norris, groom of the &s;tole, We&s;ton, and
Brereton, gentlemen of the King's chamber, together with Mark Smeton, groom of
the chamber, were ob&s;erved to po&s;&s;e&s;s much of the Queen's friend&s;hip;
and they &s;erved her with a zeal and attachment which, tho' chiefly derived
from gratitude, might not improbably be &s;ea&s;oned with &s;ome mixture of
tenderne&s;s for &s;o amiable a prince&s;s. The King's jealou&s;y laid hold of
the &s;light|e&s;t circum&s;tance; and finding no particular object on which it
could fa&s;ten, it vented it&s;elf equally on every one who came within the
verge of its fury.</P>
<P>HAD Henry's jealou&s;y been derived from love, tho' it might on
a &s;udden have proceeded to the mo&s;t violent extremities, it would have been
&s;ubject to many re|mor&s;es and contrarieties; and might at la&s;t have
&s;erved only to augment that af|fection, on which it was founded. But it was a
more &s;tern jealou&s;y, fo&s;tered en|tirely by pride: His love was wholly
transferred to another object. Jane Sey|mour, daughter of Sir John Seymour, and
maid of honour to the Queen, a young lady of &s;ingular beauty and merit, had
obtained an entire a&s;cendant over him; and he was determined to &s;acrifice
every thing to the gratification of this new appetite. Unlike to mo&s;t
monarchs, who judge lightly of the crime of gal|lantry, and who deem the young
dam&s;els of their court rather honoured than di&s;|graced by their
pa&s;&s;ion, he never thought of any other attachment than that of mar|riage; 
<PB N="204" REF="209"> and in order to attain this end, he underwent more
difficulties and com|mitted greater crimes than tho&s;e which he &s;ought to
avoid by forming that legal connexion. And having thus entertained the de&s;ign
of rai&s;ing his new mi&s;tre&s;s to his bed and throne, he more willingly
hearkened to every &s;ugge&s;tion, which threw any imputation of guilt on the
unfortunate Anne Boleyn.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t May.</NOTE> THE King's jealou&s;y
fir&s;t appeared openly in a tilting at Greenwich, where the Queen happened to
drop her handkerchief; an incident probably ca|&s;ual, but interpreted by him
as an in&s;tance of gallantry to &s;ome of her para|mours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 198.</NOTE>. He immediately retired from the
place; &s;ent orders to confine her to her chamber; arre&s;ted Norris,
Brereton, We&s;ton, and Smeton, together with her brother, Rocheford; and threw
them into pri&s;on. The Queen, a&s;toni&s;hed at the&s;e in&s;tances of his
fury, thought that he meant only to try her; but finding him in earne&s;t,
&s;he reflected on his ob&s;tinate unrelenting &s;pirit, and &s;he prepared
her&s;elf for that melancholy doom, which was awaiting her. Next day, &s;he was
&s;ent to the Tower; and on her way thither, &s;he was informed of her
&s;uppo&s;ed offences, of which &s;he had been hitherto ignorant: She made
earne&s;t prote&s;tations of her innocence; and when &s;he entered the
pri&s;on, &s;he fell on her knees, and prayed God &s;o to help her, as &s;he
was not guilty of the crime imputed to her. Her &s;urprize and confu&s;ion
threw her into hi&s;terical di&s;orders; and in that &s;ituation, &s;he thought
that the be&s;t proof of innocence was to make an entire confe&s;&s;ion, and
&s;he di&s;covered &s;ome indi&s;cretions and levities, which her &s;implicity
had equally be|trayed her to commit and to avow. She owned, that &s;he had once
rallied Norris on his delaying his marriage, and had told him, that he probably
expected her, when &s;he &s;hould be a widow: She had reproved We&s;ton, &s;he
&s;aid, for his af|fection to a kin&s;woman of hers, and his indifference
towards his wife: But he told her, that &s;he had mi&s;taken the object of his
affection, for it was her&s;elf: Upon which, &s;he defied him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. 1. p. 281.</NOTE>. She affirmed, that Smeton had
never been in her chamber but twice when he played on the harp&s;icord: But
&s;he acknowledged, that he had once had the boldne&s;s to tell her, that a
look &s;ufficed him. The King, in&s;tead of being &s;atisfied with the candour
and &s;incerity of her confe&s;&s;ion, regarded the&s;e indi&s;cretions only as
preludes to greater and more criminal intimacies.</P>
<P>OF all tho&s;e multitudes, whom the beneficence of the Queen's
temper had obliged, during her pro&s;perous fortune, no one dur&s;t interpo&s;e
between her and the King's fury; and the per&s;on, who&s;e advancement every
breath had favoured, and every countenance had &s;miled upon, was now left
neglected and abandoned. Even her uncle the duke of Norfolk, preferring the
connexions of party to the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">es of
blood, was become her mo&s;t dangerous enemy; and all the retainers to the 
<PB N="205" REF="210"> catholic religion hoped, that her death would terminate
the King's quarrel with Rome, and leave him again to his natural and early
bent, which had inclined him to &s;upport the mo&s;t intimate connexions with
the apo&s;tolic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ee. Cranmer alone,
of all the Queen's adherents, &s;till retained his friend&s;hip for her; and,
as far as the King's impetuo&s;ity permitted him, he endeavoured to moderate
the violent prejudices, entertained again&s;t her.</P>
<P>THE Queen her&s;elf wrote Henry a letter from the Tower, full of
the mo&s;t tender expo&s;tulations, and of the warme&s;t prote&s;tations of
innocence. It contains &s;o much nature and even elegance, as to de&s;erve to
be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, without any alteration of the expre&s;&s;ion.
It is as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>SIR, your grace's di&s;plea&s;ure, and my impri&s;onment are
things &s;o &s;trange unto me, as what to write, or what to excu&s;e, I am
altogether ignorant. Whereas you &s;end unto me (willing me to confe&s;s a
truth, and &s;o obtain your favour) by &s;uch an one, whom you know to be mine
antient profe&s;&s;ed enemy, I no &s;ooner received this me&s;&s;age by him,
than I rightly conceived your mean|ing; and, if, as you &s;ay, confe&s;&s;ing a
truth indeed may procure my &s;afety, I &s;hall with all willingne&s;s and duty
perform your command.</P>
<P>BUT let not your grace ever imagine, that your poor wife will
ever be brought to acknowledge a fault, where not &s;o much as a thought
thereof pre|ceded. And to &s;peak a truth, never prince had wife more loyal in
all duty, and in all true affection, than you have ever found in Anne Boleyn:
With which name and place I could willingly have contented my&s;elf, if God and
your grace's plea&s;ure had been &s;o plea&s;ed. Neither did I at any time &s;o
far forget my&s;elf in my exaltation or received queen&s;hip, but that I always
looked for &s;uch an alteration as I now find; for the ground of my preferment
being on no &s;urer foundation than your grace's fancy, the lea&s;t alteration
I knew was fit and &s;ufficient to draw that fancy to &s;ome other object. You
have cho&s;en me from a low e&s;tate to be your Queen and companion, far beyond
my de&s;ert or de&s;ire. If then you found me worthy of &s;uch honour, good
your grace let not any light fancy, or bad coun&s;el of mine enemies, withdraw
your princely favour from me; neither let that &s;tain, that unworthy &s;tain,
of a di&s;loyal heart towards your good grace, ever ca&s;t &s;o foul a blot on
your mo&s;t dutiful wife, and the infant prince&s;s your daughter. Try me, good
King, but let me have a lawful trial, and let not my &s;worn enemies &s;it as
my accu&s;ers and judges; yea let me receive an open trial, for my truth
&s;hall fear no open &s;hame; then &s;hall you &s;ee either mine innocence
cleared, your &s;u&s;picion and <PB N="206" REF="211"> con&s;cience
&s;atisfied, the ignominy and &s;lander of the world &s;topped, or my guilt
openly declared. So that what&s;oever God or you may determine of me, your
grace may be freed from an open cen&s;ure, and mine offence being &s;o
law|fully proved, your grace is at liberty, both before God and man, not only
to execute worthy puni&s;hment on me as an unlawful wife, but to follow your
af|fection, already &s;ettled on that party, for who&s;e &s;ake I am now as I
am, who&s;e name I could &s;ome good while &s;ince have pointed unto, your
grace not being ignorant of my &s;u&s;picion therein.</P>
<P>BUT if you have already determined of me, and that not only my
death, but an infamous &s;lander mu&s;t bring you the enjoying of your
de&s;ired happine&s;s; then I de&s;ire of God, that he will pardon your great
&s;in there|in, and likewi&s;e mine enemies, the in&s;truments thereof, and
that he will not call you to a &s;trict account for your unprincely and cruel
u&s;age of me, at his general judgment-&s;eat, where both you and my&s;elf
mu&s;t &s;hortly ap|pear, and in who&s;e judgment I doubt not (what&s;oever the
world may think of me) mine innocence &s;hall be openly known, and
&s;ufficiently cleared.</P>
<P>MY la&s;t and only reque&s;t &s;hall be, that my&s;elf may
only bear the burden of your grace's di&s;plea&s;ure, and that it may not touch
the innocent &s;ouls of tho&s;e poor gentlemen, who (as I under&s;tand) are
likewi&s;e in &s;trait impri&s;on|ment for my &s;ake. If ever I have found
favour in your &s;ight, if ever the name of Anne Boleyn hath been plea&s;ing in
your ears, then let me obtain this reque&s;t, and I will &s;o leave to trouble
your grace any further, with mine earn|e&s;t prayers to the Trinity to have
your grace in his good keeping, and to di|rect you in all your actions. From my

</LETTER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Her trial.</NOTE> THIS letter had no
influence on the unrelenting mind of Henry, who was de|termined to pave the way
for his new marriage by the death of Anne Boleyn. Norris, We&s;ton, Brereton,
and Smeton, were tried; but no legal evidence was produced again&s;t them. The
chief proof of their guilt con&s;i&s;ted in a hear-&s;ay report from one lady
Wingfield, who was dead. Smeton was prevailed on, by the vain hope of life, to
confe&s;s a criminal corre&s;pondence with the Queen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 202.</NOTE>; but even her enemies expected
little advantage from this confe&s;&s;ion: For they never dared to confront him
with her; and he was immediately executed; as were <PB N="207" REF="212">
al&s;o Brereton and We&s;ton. Norris had been much in the King's favour; and an
offer was made him of life, if he would confe&s;s his crime, and accu&s;e the
Queen: But he generou&s;ly rejected that propo&s;al; and &s;aid, that in his
con&s;cience he be|lieved her entirely guiltle&s;s: But, for his part, he could
accu&s;e her of nothing, and he would die a thou&s;and deaths rather than
calumniate an innocent per&s;on.</P>
<P>THE Queen and her brother were tried by a jury of peers,
con&s;i&s;ting of the duke of Suffolk, the Marquis of Exeter, the earl of
Arundel, and twenty-three more: Their uncle, the duke of Norfolk, pre&s;ided as
lord high &s;teward. Upon what proof or pretext the crime of ince&s;t was
imputed to them is unknown: The chief evidence, it is &s;aid, amounted to no
more than that Rocheford had been &s;een to lean on her bed before &s;ome
company. Part of the charge again&s;t her was, that &s;he had affirmed to her
minions, that the King never had her heart; and had &s;aid to each of them
apart, that &s;he loved him better than any per&s;on what&s;oever: <HI>Which
was to the &s;lander of the i&s;&s;ue begot between the King and her:</HI> By
this &s;trained interpretation, her guilt was brought under the &s;tatute of
the 25th of this reign; in which it was declared criminal to throw any
&s;lander upon the King, Queen, or their i&s;&s;ue. Such palpable ab&s;urdities
were, at that time, admitted, and they were regarded by the peers of England as
a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for &s;acri|ficing an innocent Queen to the cruelty of
their tyrant. Tho' una&s;&s;i&s;ted by coun|&s;el, &s;he defended her&s;elf
with great judgment and pre&s;ence of mind; and the &s;pectators could not
forbear pronouncing her entirely innocent. Judgment, how|ever, was given by the
court, both again&s;t the Queen and lord Rocheford; and her verdict contained,
that &s;he &s;hould be burned or beheaded at the King's plea|&s;ure. When this
dreadful &s;entence was pronounced, &s;he was not terrified, but lifting up her
hands to heaven, &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"O! Father, O! Creator, thou who art the way,
the truth, and the life, thou knowe&s;t that I have not de&s;erved this
death."</Q> And then turning to the judges, made the mo&s;t pathetic
decla|rations of her innocence.</P>
<P>HENRY, not &s;atisfied with this cruel vengeance, was re&s;olved
entirely to annul his marriage with Anne Boleyn, and to declare her i&s;&s;ue
illegitimate: He recalled to his memory, that, a little after her appearance in
the Engli&s;h court, &s;ome attach|ment had been acknowledged between her and
the earl of Northumberland, then lord Piercy; and he now que&s;tioned the
nobleman with regard to the&s;e engage|ments. Northumberland took an oath
before the two archbi&s;hops, that no con|tract nor promi&s;e of marriage had
ever pa&s;&s;ed between them: He received the &s;acrament upon it, before the
duke of Norfolk and others of the privy council; and this &s;olemn act he
accompanied with the mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tations of his ve|racity. 
<PB N="208" REF="213"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, page 384.</NOTE>. The
Queen, however, was &s;haken by menaces of executing the &s;en|tence again&s;t
her in its greate&s;t rigour, and was prevailed on to confe&s;s in court,
&s;ome lawful impediment to her marriage with the King<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 94.</NOTE>. The afflicted primate, who &s;at as judge,
thought him&s;elf obliged by this confe&s;&s;ion, to pronounce the marriage
null and invalid. Henry, in the tran&s;ports of his fury, did not perceive that
his proceedings were totally incon&s;i&s;tent, and that if her marriage was,
from the beginning, invalid, &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly be guilty of
adultery.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And execu|tion.</NOTE> THE Queen now prepared
for &s;uffering that death to which &s;he was &s;en|tenced. She &s;ent her
la&s;t me&s;&s;age to the King, and acknowledged the obligations which &s;he
owed him, in continuing thus uniformly his endeavours for her ad|vancement:
From a private gentlewoman, &s;he &s;aid, he had fir&s;t made her a
marchione&s;s, then a queen, and now, &s;ince he could rai&s;e her no higher in
this world, he was &s;ending her to be a &s;aint in heaven: She then renewed
the pro|te&s;tations of her innocence, and recommended her daughter to his
care. Before the lieutenant of the Tower, and all who approached her, &s;he
made the like de|clarations; and continued to behave her&s;elf with her u&s;ual
&s;erenity, and even with chearfulne&s;s. 
<Q REND="inline">"The executioner," &s;he &s;aid to the
lieutenant, "is, I hear, very expert; and my neck is very &s;lender:"</Q> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> Upon which &s;he gra&s;ped it
in her hand, and laughed heartily. When brought, however, to the &s;caffold,
&s;he &s;oftened her tone a little with regard to her prote&s;tations of
innocence. She reflected, that the ob&s;tinacy of Queen Catherine, and her
re&s;i&s;tance to the King's will, had much alienated him from the lady Mary;
and her maternal concern, therefore, for Elizabeth, prevailed in the&s;e la&s;t
moments over that indignation, which the unju&s;t &s;entence, by which &s;he
&s;uffered, naturally excited in her. She &s;aid, that &s;he was come to die,
as &s;he was &s;entenced, by the law: She would ac|cu&s;e none, nor &s;ay any
thing of the ground upon which &s;he was judged. She prayed heartily for the
King; and called him a mo&s;t merciful and gentle prince, and acknowledged,
that he had always been to her a good and gracious &s;overeign; and if any one
&s;hould think proper to canva&s;s her cau&s;e, &s;he de&s;ired him to judge
the be&s;t<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">5.</NOTE>. She was beheaded by the
executioner of Calais, who was brought over as more expert than any in England.
Her body was negligently thrown into a common che&s;t of elm-tree, made to hold
arrows; and was buried in the Tower.</P>
<P>THE innocence of this unfortunate Queen cannot rea&s;onably be
called in que&s;|tion. Henry him&s;elf, in the violence of his rage, knew not
whom to accu&s;e as her lover; and tho' he imputed guilt to her brother, and
four per&s;ons more, he <PB N="209" REF="214"> was able to bring proof
again&s;t none of them. The whole tenour of her con|duct forbids us to
a&s;cribe to her an abandoned character, &s;uch as is implied in the King's
accu&s;ation; and had &s;he been &s;o lo&s;t to all prudence and &s;en&s;e of
&s;hame; &s;he mu&s;t have expo&s;ed her&s;elf to detection, and afforded her
enemies the cleare&s;t evidence again&s;t her. But the King made the mo&s;t
effectual apology for her, by marrying Jane Seymour the very day after her
execution<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Burnet vol I. p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">7.</NOTE>. His im|patience to gratify
this new pa&s;&s;ion, cau&s;ed him to forget all regard to decency; and his
cruel heart was not &s;oftened a moment by the bloody cata&s;trophe of a
per&s;on, who had &s;o long been the object of his mo&s;t tender
affections.</P>
<P>THE lady Mary thought the death of her &s;tep-mother a proper
opportunity for reconciling her&s;elf with the King, who, be&s;ides other
cau&s;es of di&s;gu&s;t, had been offended with her, on account of the part
which &s;he had taken in her mother's quarrel. Her advances were not at fir&s;t
received; and Henry exacted from her &s;ome further proofs of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
and obedience: He required this young prin|ce&s;s, then about twenty years of
age, to adopt his theological tenets; to acknow|ledge his &s;upremacy; to
renounce the pope; and to own her mother's marriage to be ince&s;tuous and
unlawful. The&s;e points were of hard dige&s;tion with the prince&s;s; but
after &s;ome delays, and even refu&s;als, &s;he was at la&s;t prevailed with to
write a letter to her father<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

a&s;&s;ent to the articles required of her: Upon which &s;he was received into
favour. But notwith&s;tanding the return of the King's affection to the
i&s;&s;ue of his fir&s;t marriage, he dive&s;ted not him&s;elf of kindne&s;s
towards the lady Elizabeth; and the new Queen, who was ble&s;t with a
&s;ingular &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, di&s;covered &s;trong proofs of
attachment to that young prince&s;s.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8th June.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> THE trial and conviction
of Queen Anne, and the &s;ub&s;equent events, made it nece&s;&s;ary for the
King to &s;ummon a new Parliament; and he here, in his &s;peech, made a merit
to his people, that, notwith&s;tanding his misfortunes in his two former
marriages, he had been induced, for their good, to venture on a third. The
&s;peaker received this profe&s;&s;ion with a &s;uitable gratitude; and he took
thence oc|ca&s;ion to prai&s;e the King for his wonderful gifts of grace and
nature: He com|pared him, for ju&s;tice and prudence, to Solomon; for
&s;trength and fortitude to Samp&s;on; and for beauty and comeline&s;s to
Ab&s;alom. The King very humbly replied, by the mouth of his chancellor, that
he di&s;avowed the&s;e prai&s;es; &s;ince, if he was really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of &s;uch virtues, they were the gifts of Almighty God only. Henry found that
the Parliament were equally &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive in deeds as
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> in their expre&s;&s;ions; and
that they would go the &s;ame lengths as the

attainted; the i&s;&s;ue of both the two former marriages were declared
illegitimate, and it was even made trea&s;on to a&s;&s;ert the legitimacy of
either of them; to throw any &s;lander upon the pre&s;ent King, Queen, or their
i&s;&s;ue, was &s;ubjected to the &s;ame penalty; the crown was &s;ettled on
the King's i&s;&s;ue by Jane Seymour, or any &s;ub&s;equent wife; and in ca&s;e

be guilty of trea&s;on; and by this clau&s;e a &s;pecies of political
inqui&s;i|tion was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the kingdom, as well as the accu&s;ations
of trea&s;on multi|plied to an unrea&s;onable degree. The King was al&s;o
empowered to confer on any one, by his will, or letters patent, any ca&s;tles,
honours, liberties, or franchi&s;es; words which might have been extended to
the di&s;membring the kingdom, by the erection of principalities and
independant juri&s;dictions. It was al&s;o, by another act, made trea&s;on to
marry, without the King's con&s;ent, any prince&s;s related in the fir&s;t
degree to the crown. This act was occa&s;ioned by the di&s;covery of a
de|&s;ign, formed by Thomas Howard, brother to the duke of Norfolk, to
e&s;pou&s;e the lady Margaret Douglas, niece to the King by his &s;i&s;ter the
Queen of Scots and the earl of Angus. Howard, as well as the young lady, was
committed to the Tower. She recovered her liberty &s;oon after; but he died in
that confine|ment. An act of attainder pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t him this
&s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament.</P>
<P>A NEW acce&s;&s;ion was likewi&s;e gained to the authority of
the crown: The King or any of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors was empowered to repeal or
annul, by letters patent, whatever acts of parliament had been pa&s;&s;ed
before he was four and twenty years of age. Whoever maintained the authority of
the bi&s;hop of Rome, by word or writ, or endeavoured in any manner to
re&s;tore it in England, was &s;ubjected to the penalty of a premunire; that
is, his goods were forfeited, and he was put out of the protection of the laws.
And any per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any office, eccle|&s;ia&s;tical or
civil, or received any grant or charter from the crown; and yet re|fu&s;ed to
renounce the pope by oath, was declared to be guilty of trea&s;on. The

death, hoped that the door was opened to a reconciliation, and had been making
&s;ome ad|vances <PB N="211" REF="216"> to Henry: But this was the reception he
met with. Henry was now become ab&s;olutely indifferent with regard to papal
cen&s;ures; and finding a great increa&s;e of authority, as well as revenue, to
accrue from his quarrel with Rome, he was determined to per&s;evere in his
pre&s;ent mea&s;ures. This Parliament al&s;o, even more than any foregoing,
convinced him how much he commanded the re&s;pect of his &s;ubjects, and what
confidence he might repo&s;e in them. Tho' the elections had been made of a
&s;udden, without any preparation or in|trigue, the members di&s;covered an
unlimited attachment to his per&s;on and go|vernment<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 212.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A convoca|tion.</NOTE> THE extreme
complai&s;ance of the convocation, which &s;at at the &s;ame time with the
Parliament, encouraged him in his re&s;olution of breaking entirely with the
court of Rome. There was a divi&s;ion of &s;entiments in the minds of this
a&s;&s;embly; and as the zeal of the reformers had been augmented by &s; me
late &s;ucce&s;&s;es, the re&s;entment of the catholics was no le&s;s excited
by their fears and lo&s;&s;es: But the authority of the King kept every thing
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and &s;ilent; and the new a&s;&s;umed prerogative, the
&s;upremacy, who&s;e limits no one was fully acquainted with, re&s;trained even
the mo&s;t furious movements of theological ran|cour. Cromwel &s;at as
vicar-general; and tho' the catholic party expected, that, on the fall of Queen
Anne, his authority would receive a great check, they were &s;urprized to find
him &s;till maintain equal credit as before. With the vicar-general concurred
Cranmer the primate, Latimer bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, Shaxton of Sa|li&s;bury,
Hil&s;ey of Roche&s;ter, Fox of Hereford, Barlow of St. David's. The oppo&s;ite
party were led by Lee archbi&s;hop of York, Stoke&s;ley bi&s;hop of Lon|don,
Ton&s;tal of Durham, Gardiner of Winche&s;ter, Longland of Lincoln, Sher|borne
of Chiche&s;ter, Nix of Norwich, and Kite of Carli&s;le. The former party, by
their oppo&s;ition to the pope, &s;econded the King's ambition and love of
power: The latter party, by maintaining the ancient theological tenets, were
more con|formable to his &s;peculative principles: And both of them had
alternately the ad|vantage of gaining on his humour, by which he was more
governed than by ei|ther of the&s;e motives.</P>
<P>THE church in general was aver&s;e to the reformation; and the
lower hou&s;e framed a li&s;t of opinions, in the whole &s;ixty &s;even, which
they pronounced er|roneous, and which was a collection of principles, &s;ome
held by the ancient Lol|lards, others by the modern prote&s;tants, or
Go&s;pellers, as they were &s;ometimes called. This catalogue they &s;ent to
the upper hou&s;e to be cen&s;ured; but in the preamble of their
repre&s;entation, they di&s;covered the &s;ervile &s;pirit by which they were
governed. They &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"that they intended not to do or &s;peak any
thing <PB N="212" REF="217"> which might be unplea&s;ant to the King, whom they
acknowledge their &s;u|preme head, and who&s;e commands they were re&s;olved to

<P>THE convocation came at la&s;t, after &s;ome debate, to decide
articles of reli|gion; and their tenets were of as compounded a nature as the
a&s;&s;embly it&s;elf, or rather as the King's &s;y&s;tem of theology, by which
they were re&s;olved entirely to &s;quare their principles. They determined the
&s;tandard of faith to con&s;i&s;t in the &s;criptures and the three creeds,
the Apo&s;tolic, the Nicene, and the Athana&s;ian; and this article was a
&s;ignal victory to the reformers: Auricular confe&s;&s;ion and pennance were
admitted, a doctrine agreeable to the catholics: No mention was made of
marriage, extreme unction, confirmation, or holy orders, as &s;acraments; and
in this omi&s;&s;ion the influence of the prote&s;tants appeared. The real
pre&s;ence was a&s;&s;erted, conformable to the ancient doctrine: The terms of
acceptance were e&s;ta|bli&s;hed to be the merits of Chri&s;t, and the mercy
and good plea&s;ure of God, &s;uitable to the new principles.</P>
<P>SO far the two &s;ects &s;eem to have made a fair partition, by
&s;haring alternately the &s;everal clau&s;es. In framing the &s;ub&s;equent
articles, each of them &s;eems to have thrown in their ingredient. The
catholics prevailed in a&s;&s;erting, that the u&s;e of images was warranted by
&s;cripture; the prote&s;tants, in warning the peo|ple again&s;t idolatry, and
the abu&s;e of the&s;e &s;en&s;ible repre&s;entations. The ancient faith was
adopted in maintaining the expediency of praying to &s;aints; the late
in|novations in rejecting the peculiar patronage of &s;aints to any trade,
profe&s;&s;ion, or cour&s;e of action. The former rites of wor&s;hip, the u&s;e
of holy water, the ceremonies practi&s;ed on A&s;h-wedne&s;day, Palm-&s;unday,
and Good-friday, &amp;c. were &s;till maintained; but the new re&s;inements
were al&s;o adopted, which made light of the&s;e in&s;titutions, by the
convocation's denying that they had any imme|diate power of remitting &s;in,
and by its a&s;&s;erting that their &s;ole merit con&s;i&s;ted in promoting
pious and devout di&s;po&s;itions in the mind.</P>
<P>BUT the article with regard to purgatory, contains the mo&s;t
curious jargon, ambiguity, and he&s;itation, ari&s;ing from the mixture of
oppo&s;ite tenets. It was to this purpo&s;e: 
<Q REND="inline">"Since according to due order of charity, and
the book of Maccabees, and divers ancient authors, it is a very good and
charitable deed to pray for &s;ouls departed; and &s;ince &s;uch a practice has

&s;hould in&s;truct the people not to be grieved for the continuance of the

<P>THESE articles, when framed by the convocation, and corrected by
the King, were &s;ub&s;cribed by every member of that a&s;&s;embly; while,
perhaps, neither there nor throughout the whole kingdom, could one man be
found, except the King him&s;elf, who had adopted preci&s;ely the&s;e very
doctrines and opinions. For tho' there be not any contradiction in the tenets
here advanced, it had happened in England, as in all other &s;tates where

oppo&s;ition to Rome farther than the&s;e articles: None of the catholics went
&s;o far: And the King, by being able to retain the nation in &s;uch a delicate

any hi&s;tory furni&s;hes an example. To change the religion of a country, even
when &s;econded by a party, is one of the mo&s;t perilous enterprizes, which
any &s;overeign can attempt, and often proves the mo&s;t de&s;tructive to royal
authority. But Henry was able to &s;et that furious machine in movement, and
yet regulate and even &s;top its career: He could &s;ay to it, thus far &s;halt
thou go and no farther: And he made every vote of his parliament and
convocation &s;ub&s;ervient, not only to his intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, but

prohibited &s;everal &s;uper&s;titions, gainful to the clergy, &s;uch as

again&s;t the King's reply was the chief cau&s;e, which retained the
malecontents in arms, and that a milder an&s;wer would probably di&s;|&s;ipate

preparing to march again&s;t the rebels; and being &s;o well fortified with
power, he thought, that, without lo&s;ing his dignity, he might now &s;how them

to re|turn to their obedience, with &s;ecret a&s;&s;urances of pardon. This
expedient had its effect: The populace were di&s;&s;ipated: Mackrel and &s;ome

part of the multitude retired peaceably to their u&s;ual occupations: A few of
the more ob&s;tinate fled into the North, where they joined the in&s;urrection,
that was rai&s;ed in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>THE northern in&s;urgents, as they were more numerous, were

Scotland, which might make advantage of the&s;e di&s;orders. One A&s;ke, a

governing the populace. Their enterprize they called the <HI>Pilgrimage of

their care of the King's per&s;on and i&s;&s;ue&punc; their de&s;ire of
purifying the nobility, of driving ba&s;e-born per&s;ons from about the King,
of re&s;toring the church, and of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing here&s;y. Allured by
the&s;e fair pretences, about 40,000 men from the counties of York, Durham,
Lanca&s;ter, and tho&s;e northern pro|vinces, flocked to their &s;tandard; and

<P>THE Earl of Shrew&s;bury, moved by his zeal for the King's

fa|voured the cau&s;e, &s;eemed to yield to the force impo&s;ed on them, and
joined the rebels.</P>
<P>THE duke of Norfolk was named general in chief of the King's
forces again&s;t the northern in&s;urgents; and as he headed the party, which
&s;upported the antient religion, he was al&s;o &s;u&s;pected of bearing &s;ome
favour to the cau&s;e, which he was &s;ent to oppo&s;e. His prudent conduct,
however, &s;eems to acquit him of this im|putation. He encamped at Donca&s;ter,
together with the earl of Shrew&s;bury; and as his army was &s;mall, &s;carce
exceeding five thou&s;and men, he made choice of a po&s;t, where he had the
river in front, the ford of which he propo&s;ed to de&s;end again&s;t the
rebels. They had intended to attack him in the morning; but dur|ing the night,
there fell &s;uch violent rains as rendered the river utterly impa&s;&s;i|ble;
and Norfolk very wi&s;ely laid hold of the opportunity to enter into treaty
with them. In order to open the door for negotiation, he &s;ent them a herald;
whom A&s;ke, their leader, received with great ceremony; he him&s;elf &s;itting
in a chair of &s;tate, with the archbi&s;hop of York on one hand, and lord
Darcy on the other. It was agreed that two gentlemen &s;hould be di&s;patched
to the King with propo&s;als from the in&s;urgents; and Henry protracted giving
an an&s;wer, and allured them with hopes of entire &s;atisfaction, in
expectation that nece&s;&s;ity would &s;oon oblige them to di&s;per&s;e
them&s;elves. Being informed, that his artifice had in a great mea&s;ure
&s;ucceeded, he required them in&s;tantly to lay down their arms and &s;ubmit
to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rcy; promi&s;ing a pardon to
all except &s;ix whom he named, and <PB N="217" REF="222"> four whom he
re&s;erved to him&s;elf the power of naming. But tho' the greate&s;t part of
the rebels had gone home for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, they had entered into
the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements to return to their &s;tandards, in ca&s;e the
King's an|&s;wer &s;hould not prove &s;atisfactory. Norfolk, therefore, &s;oon
found him&s;elf in the &s;ame difficulty as before; and he opened again a
negotiation with the leaders of the multitude. He engaged them to &s;end three
hundred per&s;ons to Donca&s;ter, with propo&s;als for an accommodation; and he
hoped to be able, by intrigue and &s;eparate intere&s;ts, to throw
di&s;&s;en&s;ion among &s;o great a number. A&s;ke him&s;elf had propo&s;ed to
be one of the deputies, and he required a ho&s;tage for his &s;ecu|rity: But
the King, when con&s;ulted, replied, that he knew no gentleman or other, whom
he e&s;teemed &s;o little as to put him in pledge for &s;uch a villain. The
demands of the in&s;urgents were &s;o exorbitant, that Norfolk rejected them;
and they prepared again to decide the conte&s;t by force of arms. They were as
formidable as ever both by their numbers and &s;pirit; and notwith&s;tanding a
&s;mall river, which lay between them and the royal army, Norfolk had great
rea|&s;on to dread the effects of their fury. But while they were preparing to
pa&s;s the ford, rain fell a &s;econd time in &s;uch abundance, as made it
impracticable for them to execute their de&s;ign; and the populace, partly
reduced to nece&s;&s;ity by the want of provi&s;ions, partly &s;truck with
&s;uper&s;tition at being thus again di&s;appointed by the &s;ame accident,
&s;uddenly di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves. The duke of Norfolk, who had received
powers for that end, forwarded the di&s;per&s;ion, by the promi&s;e of a
general amne&s;ty; and the King ratified this act of clemency. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of De|cember.</NOTE> He publi&s;hed,
how|ever, a manife&s;to again&s;t the rebels, and an an&s;wer to their
complaints; where he employed a very lofty &s;tyle, &s;uited to &s;o haughty a
monarch. He told them, that they ought no more to pretend giving a judgment
with regard to govern|ment, than a blind man with regard to colours: 
<Q REND="inline">"And we," he added, "with our whole council
think it right &s;trange, that ye, who be but brutes and in|expert folk, do
take upon you to appoint us, who be meet or not for our council."</Q></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1537" UNIT="year"> As this pacification was not
likely to be of long continuance, Norfolk was or|dered to keep his army
together, and to go into the northern parts, in order to ex|act a general
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Lord Darcy as well as A&s;ke were &s;ent for to court; and
the former, upon his refu&s;al or delay to appear, was thrown into pri&s;on.
Every place was full of jealou&s;y and complaints. A new in&s;urrection broke
out, headed by Mu&s;grave and Tilby; and the rebels be&s;ieged Carli&s;le with
8000 men. Being repul&s;ed by that town, they were encountered in their retreat
by Norfolk, who put them to flight; and having made pri&s;oners of all their
officers, except <PB N="218" REF="223"> Mu&s;grave, who e&s;caped, he
in&s;tantly put them to death by martial law, to the number of &s;eventy
per&s;ons. An attempt made by Sir Francis Bigot and Halam to &s;urprize Hull,
met with no better &s;ucce&s;s; and &s;everal other ri&s;ings were
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the vigilance of Norfolk. The King, enraged by the&s;e
multiplied revolts, was determined not to adhere to the general pardon, which
he had granted; and from a movement of his u&s;ual violence, he made the
innocent &s;uffer for the guilty. Norfolk, by command from his ma&s;ter,
&s;pread the royal banner, and, wherever he thought proper, executed martial
law in the puni&s;hment of offenders. Be&s;ides A&s;ke, leader of the fir&s;t
in&s;urrection, Sir Robert Con&s;table, Sir John Bulmer, Sir Thomas Piercy, Sir
Stephen Hamilton, Nicholas Tempe&s;t, William Lumley, and many others, were
thrown into pri&s;on; and mo&s;t of them were condemned and executed. Lord
Huffey was found guilty as an accomplice in the in&s;urrection of
Lincoln&s;hire, and was executed at Lincoln. Lord Darcy, tho' he pleaded
compul&s;ion, and appealed to a long life, pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ervice of the
crown, was beheaded on Tower-hill. Before his execution, he accu&s;ed Nor|folk
of having &s;ecretly encouraged the rebels; but Henry, either &s;en&s;ible of
that nobleman's great &s;ervices and convinced of his fidelity, or afraid to
offend one of &s;uch exten&s;ive power and great capacity, rejected the
information. Being now &s;atiated with puni&s;hing the rebels, he publi&s;hed
anew a general pardon, to which he faithfully adhered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 428.</NOTE>; and he erected by patent a court of
ju&s;tice at York, for deciding law&s;uits to the northern counties: A demand

however, a neutrality in the wars, which were carried on, with various
&s;ucce&s;s, and without any deci&s;ive event, between Charles and Francis; and
tho' inclined more to favour the latter, he was determined not to incur,
without nece&s;&s;ity, either hazard or expence in his behalf. A truce,

articles in their confe&s;&s;ion which Henry di&s;liked; and they &s;ent new

endeavoured to convince the King, that he was guilty of a mi&s;take, in

to &s;o great a monarch and theologian. He found arguments and &s;yllogi&s;ms
enough to defend his cau&s;e; and he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the amba&s;&s;adors
without coming to any conclu&s;ion. Jealous al&s;o le&s;t his own &s;ubjects
&s;hould become &s;uch theologians as to que&s;tion his tenets, he u&s;ed great

intere&s;t was made to pre&s;erve &s;ome convents of women, who, as they lived
in the mo&s;t irreproach|able manner, ju&s;tly merited, it was thought, that
their hou&s;es &s;hould be &s;aved from the general de&s;truction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 328.</NOTE>. There appeared al&s;o great
difference between the ca&s;e of nuns and friars; and the one in&s;titution
might be very laudable, while the other was expo&s;ed to much blame. The males
of all ranks, if endowed with indu&s;try, might be of &s;ervice to the public;
and none of them could want em|ployment, &s;uited to his &s;tation and
capacity. But a woman of family, who failed of a &s;ettlement in the married
&s;tate, an accident to which &s;uch per&s;ons were more liable than women of
lower &s;tation, had really no rank which &s;he properly filled; and a convent
was a retreat both honourable and agreeable, from the inutility and often want,
which attended her &s;ituation. But the King was determined to abo|li&s;h
mona&s;teries of every denomination; and probably thought, that the&s;e antient
e&s;tabli&s;hments would be the &s;ooner forgot, that no remains of them, of
any kind, were allowed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE better to reconcile the people to this great innovation,
&s;tories were pub|li&s;hed of the dete&s;table lives of the friars in many of
the convents; and great care was taken to defame tho&s;e whom the court was
determined to ruin. The relicts al&s;o, and &s;uper&s;titions, which had &s;o
long been the object of the people's venera|tion, were expo&s;ed to their
ridicule; and the religious &s;pirit, now le&s;s bent on ex|terior
ob&s;ervances and &s;en&s;ible objects, was encouraged in this new direction.
It is needle&s;s to be particular in &s;uch an enumeration: Prote&s;tant
hi&s;torians mention on this occa&s;ion with great triumph the &s;acred
repo&s;itories of convents; the par|ings <PB N="221" REF="226"> of St. Edmond's
toes; &s;ome of the coals that roa&s;ted St. Laurence; the girdle of the Virgin
&s;hown in eleven &s;everal places; two or three heads of St. Ur&s;ula; the
felt of St. Thomas of Lanca&s;ter, an infallible cure for the headach; part of
St. Thomas of Canterbury's &s;hirt, much reverenced by big bellied wo|men;
&s;ome relicts, an excellent preventive again&s;t rain; others, a remedy to
weeds in corn. But &s;uch fooleries, as they are to be found in all ages and
na|tions of the world, and even took place during the mo&s;t refined periods of
an|tiquity, form no peculiar nor violent reproach on the catholic religion.</P>
<P>THERE were al&s;o di&s;covered in the mona&s;teries &s;ome
impo&s;tures of a more ar|tificial nature. At Hales, in the county of
Glouce&s;ter, had been &s;hown, during &s;everal ages, the blood of Chri&s;t
brought from Jeru&s;alem; and it is ea&s;y to ima|gine the veneration, with
which &s;uch a relict was regarded. A miraculous cir|cum&s;tance al&s;o
attended this miraculous relict; the &s;acred blood was not vi&s;ible to any
one in mortal &s;in, even when &s;et before him; and till he had performed good
works &s;ufficient for his ab&s;olution, it would not deign to di&s;cover
it&s;elf to him. At the di&s;&s;olution of the mona&s;tery, the whole
contrivance was di&s;covered. Two of the monks, who were let into the &s;ecret,
had taken the blood of a duck, which they renewed every week: They put it into
a phial, one &s;ide of which con&s;i&s;ted of thin and tran&s;parent
chry&s;tal, the other of thick and ob&s;cure. When any rich pilgrim arrived,
they were &s;ure to &s;how him the dark &s;ide of the phial, till ma&s;&s;es
and offerings had expiated his offences; and then finding his money, or
patience, or faith, near exhau&s;ted, they made him happy by turning the
phial<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 431, 432. Stowe, p. 575.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A MIRACULOUS crucifix had been kept at Boxley in Kent, and bore
the appella|tion of the <HI>Rood of Grace.</HI> The lips, and eyes, and head of
the image moved on the approach of its votaries. Hil&s;ey, bi&s;hop of
Roche&s;ter, broke the crucifix at St. Paul's cro&s;s, and &s;hewed the whole
people the &s;prings and wheels by which it had been &s;ecretly moved. A great
wooden idol of Wales, called Darvel Ga|therin, was al&s;o brought to London,
and cut in pieces: And by a cruel refine|ment of vengeance, it was employed as
fuel to burn fryar Fore&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals.
Stowe, p. 575. Herbert. Baker, p. 286.</NOTE>, who was puni&s;hed for denying
the &s;upremacy, and for &s;ome pretended here&s;ies. A finger of St. Andrew's,
covered with a thin plate of &s;ilver, had been pawned by a con|vent for a debt
of forty pounds; but as the King's commi&s;&s;ioners refu&s;ed to re|lea&s;e
the pawn, people made them&s;elves very merry with the poor creditor, on
account of his &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>BUT of all the in&s;truments of antient &s;uper&s;tition, no-one
was &s;o zealou&s;ly de&s;troyed as the &s;hrine of Thomas a Becket, commonly
called St. Thomas of <PB N="222" REF="227"> Canterbury. This &s;aint owed his
canonization to the zealous defence, which he had made for the apo&s;tolic
&s;ee; and on that account al&s;o, the monks had ex|tremely encouraged the
devotion of pilgrimages towards his tomb, and number|le&s;s were the miracles,
which, they pretended, his relicts wrought on his devout votaries. They
rai&s;ed his body once a year; and the day, on which this cere|mony was
performed, which was called the day of his tran&s;lation, was a general
holyday: Every fiftieth year there was celebrated a jubilee to his honour,
which la&s;ted fifteen days: Plenary indulgences were then granted to all that
vi&s;ited his tomb; and a hundred thou&s;and pilgrims have been regi&s;tered at
a time in Can|terbury. The devotion towards him had quite effaced in that town
the adora|tion of the Deity; nay, even that of the Virgin. At God's altar, for
in&s;tance, there was offered in one year three pounds two &s;hillings and
&s;ix-pence; at the Virgin's, &s;ixty three pounds five &s;hillings and
&s;ix-pence; at St. Thomas's, eight hundred and thirty two pounds twelve
&s;hillings and three-pence. But next year, the di&s;proportion was &s;till
greater: There was not a penny offered at God's altar; the Virgin's gained only
four pounds one &s;hilling and eight-pence; but St. Tho|mas had got for his
&s;hare nine hundred and fifty four pounds &s;ix &s;hillings and
three-pence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 244.</NOTE>. Lewis the
&s;eventh of France had made a pilgrimage to this miraculous tomb, and had
be&s;towed on the &s;hrine a jewel, which was e&s;teemed the riche&s;t in
Chri&s;tendom. It is obvious, how obnoxious to Henry a &s;aint of this
character mu&s;t appear, and how much contrary to all his projects for
degrading the autho|rity of the court of Rome. He not only pillaged the rich
&s;hrine, dedicated to St. Thomas: He made the &s;aint him&s;elf be cited to
appear in court, and be tried and condemned as a traitor: He ordered his name
to be &s;truck out of the ca|lender; the office for his fe&s;tival to be
expunged from all breviaries; and his bones to be burned, and the a&s;hes to be
di&s;&s;ipated.</P>
<P>ON the whole, the King, at different times, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
&s;ix hundred and forty five mona&s;teries: Of which twenty eight had abbots,
who enjoyed a &s;eat in par|liament. Ninety colleges were demoli&s;hed in
&s;everal counties; two thou&s;and three hundred and &s;eventy four chantries
and free chappels: A hundred and ten ho&s;pitals. The whole revenue of the&s;e
e&s;tabli&s;hments amounted to one hun|dred and &s;ixty one thou&s;and one
hundred pounds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert, Camden,
Speed.</NOTE>. It is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that the whole lands and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of England had, a little before this period, been rated at
three millions a year; &s;o that the revenues of the mona&s;teries did not
really much exceed the twentieth part of the national income: A &s;um va&s;tly
inferior to what is commonly apprehended. The lands belonging to the con|vents,
<PB N="223" REF="228"> were commonly let at very low lea&s;es; and the farmers,
who regarded them&s;elves as a &s;pecies of proprietors, took always care to
renew their lea&s;es be|fore they expired.</P>
<P>GREAT murmurs were every where excited again&s;t the&s;e
violences; and men much que&s;tioned, whether priors and monks, who were only
tru&s;tees or tenants for life, could by any deed, however voluntary, transfer
to the King the entire pro|perty of their e&s;tates. In order to reconcile the
people to &s;uch mighty inno|vations, they were told, that the King would never
henceforth have occa&s;ion to levy taxes, but would be able, from the abbey
lands alone, to bear, during war as well as peace, the whole charges of the
government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coke's 4th In&s;t. fol. 44.</NOTE>. While
&s;uch topics were employed to pacify the populace, the King took an effectual
method of en|gaging the nobility and gentry to take part with his
mea&s;ures<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Warwick&s;hire, p.
800.</NOTE>: He either made a gift of the revenues of convents to his
favourites and courtiers, or &s;old them at low prices, or exchanged them for
other lands on very di&s;advantageous terms. He was &s;o profu&s;e in the&s;e
liberalities, that he is &s;aid to have given a woman the whole revenues of a
convent, as a reward for making a pudding, which hap|pened to gratify his
palate<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fuller.</NOTE>. He al&s;o &s;ettled
&s;allaries on the abbots and priors, proportioned to their former revenues or
to their merits; and gave each monk a yearly pen&s;ion of eight marks: He
erected &s;ix new bi&s;hoprics, We&s;tmin&s;ter, Oxford, Peterborow, Bri&s;tol,
Che&s;ter, and Glouce&s;ter; of which the la&s;t five &s;ub&s;i&s;t at this
day: And by all the&s;e means of expence and di&s;&s;ipation, the profit which
the King reaped by the &s;eizure of church lands, fell much &s;hort of vulgar
opinion. As the ruin of convents had been fore&s;een &s;ome years ere it
hap|pened, the monks had taken care to di&s;&s;ipate beforehand mo&s;t of their
&s;tock, furniture, and plate; &s;o that the &s;poils of the great
mona&s;teries bore not, in the&s;e re&s;pects, any proportion to tho&s;e of the
le&s;&s;er.</P>
<P>BESIDE the lands, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the mona&s;teries, the
regular clergy enjoyed a con&s;iderable part of the benefices of England, and
of the tythes, annexed to them; and the&s;e were al&s;o at this time
transferred to the crown, and by that means came into the hands of laymen: An
abu&s;e which many zealous churchmen re|gard as the mo&s;t criminal
&s;acrilege. The monks were formerly much at their ea&s;e in England, and
enjoyed revenues, which much exceeded the regular and &s;tated expence of the
hou&s;e. We read of the abbey of Chert&s;ey in Surrey, which po&s;&s;e&s;t 744
pounds a year, tho' it contained only fourteen monks: That of Fur|ne&s;s, in
the county of Lincoln, was valued at 960 pounds a year, and contained but
thirty monks<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 237.</NOTE>. In
order to di&s;&s;ipate their revenues, and &s;upport popularity, the
mona&s;teries lived in a very ho&s;pitable manner; and be&s;ides the poor,
main|tained <PB N="224" REF="229"> from their offals, there were many decayed
gentlemen, who pa&s;&s;ed their lives in travelling from convent to convent,
and were entirely &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at the ta|bles of the friars. By this
ho&s;pitality, as much as by their own inactivity, did the convents prove
nur&s;eries of idlene&s;s; but the King, not to give offence by too &s;udden an
innovation, bound the new proprietors of abbey lands, to &s;upport the ancient
ho&s;pitality. But this engagement was fulfilled in very few places, and for a
very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to imagine the indignation with which intelligence
of all the&s;e vio|lences was received at Rome; and how much the
eccle&s;ia&s;tics of that court, who had &s;o long kept the world in
&s;ubjection by big &s;ounding epithets, and by holy execrations, would now
vent their rhetoric again&s;t the character and conduct of Henry. The pope was
provoked at la&s;t to publi&s;h the bull, which he had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t
that monarch; and in a public manner delivered over his &s;oul to the de|vil,
and his dominions to the fir&s;t invader. Libels were di&s;per&s;ed, where he
was compared to the mo&s;t furious per&s;ecutors in antiquity; and the
preference was even given on their &s;ide: He had declared war with the dead,
whom the pagans them&s;elves re&s;pected; was at open enmity with heaven; and
had engaged in pro|fe&s;&s;ed ho&s;tility with the whole ho&s;t of &s;aints and
angels. Above all, he was often reproached with his re&s;emblance to the
emperor Julian, whom, it was &s;aid, he imitated in his apo&s;tacy and
learning, tho' he fell &s;hort of him in his morals. Henry could
di&s;tingui&s;h in many of the&s;e libels the &s;tile and animo&s;ity of his
kin&s;man, Pole; and he was thence anew incited to vent his rage, by every
po&s;|&s;ible expedient, on that famous cardinal.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cardinal Pole.</NOTE> REGINALD de la Pole, or
Reginald Pole, was de&s;cended of the royal family, being fourth &s;on of the
counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, daughter of the duke of Clarence. He di&s;covered in
very early youth evident &s;ymptoms of that fine genius, and ge|nerous
di&s;po&s;ition, by which, during his whole life, he was &s;o much
di&s;tingui&s;h|ed; and Henry having conceived great friend&s;hip for him,
propo&s;ed to rai&s;e him to the highe&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities; and,
as a pledge of future favours, he con|ferred on him the deanry of Exeter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals.</NOTE>, in order to help him to bear the
expences of his education. Pole was carrying on his &s;tudies in Paris, at the
time when the King &s;ollicited the &s;uffrages of that univer&s;ity in favour
of his divorce; but tho' applied to by the Engli&s;h agent, he declined taking
any part in that affair. Henry bore this neglect with more temper than was
natural to him; and he ap|peared unwilling, on that account, to renounce
friend&s;hip with a per&s;on, who&s;e virtues and talents, he hoped, would
prove u&s;eful, as well as ornamental, to his court and kingdom. He allowed him
&s;till to po&s;&s;e&s;s his deanry, and gave him <PB N="225" REF="230">
permi&s;&s;ion to fini&s;h his &s;tudies at Padua: He even paid him &s;ome
court, in order to bring him into his mea&s;ures; and wrote to him, while in
Italy, de&s;iring him to give his opinion freely, with regard to the late
mea&s;ures taken in England, for aboli&s;hing the papal authority. Pole had now
entered into an intimate friend&s;hip with whatever was eminent for dignity or
merit in Italy; Sadolet, Bembo, and other revivers of true ta&s;te and
learning; and he was moved by the&s;e connections, as well as by religious
zeal, to forget, in &s;ome re&s;pect, the duty which he owed to Henry, his
benefactor, and his &s;overeign. He replied, by writing a treati&s;e of <HI>the
unity of the church,</HI> where he inveighed again&s;t the King's &s;upremacy,
his divorce, his &s;econd marriage; and even exhorted the em|peror to revenge
on him the injury done to his family, and to the catholic cau&s;e. Henry, tho'
provoked beyond mea&s;ure at this outrage, di&s;&s;embled his re&s;ent|ment;
and &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Pole, de&s;iring him to return to England, in order
to explain certain pa&s;&s;ages in his book, which he found &s;omewhat
ob&s;cure and difficult: But Pole was on his guard again&s;t this in&s;idious
invitation; and was determined to remain in Italy, where he was extremely
beloved and e&s;teemed by all the world.</P>
<P>THE pope and emperor thought them&s;elves obliged to provide for
a man of Pole's eminence and dignity, who, in &s;upport of their cau&s;e, had
&s;acrificed all his preten&s;ions to fortune in his own country. He was
created a cardinal; and tho' he never took higher orders than tho&s;e of a
deacon, he was &s;ent legate into Flanders about the year 1536<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>. Henry was &s;en&s;ible, that Pole's chief
intention in choo&s;ing that employment, was to foment the mutinous
di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h catholics; and he therefore remon&s;trated in
&s;uch a vigorous manner with the queen of Hungary, regent of the Low
Countries, that &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the legate, without allowing him to
exerci&s;e his commi&s;&s;ion. The enmity which he bore Pole, was now open, as
well as violent; and the cardinal, on his part, kept no farther mea&s;ures in
his intrigues again&s;t Henry. He is even &s;u&s;pected of a&s;piring to the
crown, by means of a marriage with the lady Mary; and the King was every day
alarmed by informations, which he received, of the corre&s;pondence maintain|ed
in England by that fugitive. Courtney, marquis of Exeter, had entered into a
con&s;piracy with him; Sir Edward Nevil, brother to the lord Abergavenny, Sir
Nicholas Carew, ma&s;ter of hor&s;e, and knight of the garter; Henry de la
Pole, lord Montacute, and Sir Geoffrey de la Pole, brothers to the cardinal.
The&s;e per&s;ons were indicted, and tried, and convicted, before lord Audley,
who pre|&s;ided in the trial, as lord high &s;teward. They were all executed,
except Sir Geoffrey de la Pole, who was pardoned; and he owed this grace to his

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE rough hand of Henry &s;eemed well adapted for rending
a&s;under tho&s;e bands, by which the ancient &s;uper&s;tition had fa&s;tened
it&s;elf on the king|dom; and tho', after renouncing the pope's &s;upremacy,
and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing mona&s;te|ries, mo&s;t of the political ends of a
reformation were already attained, few people expected, that he would &s;top at
tho&s;e innovations. The &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition, it was thought, would carry
him to the utmo&s;t extremity again&s;t the church of Rome; and lead him to
declare war again&s;t the whole doctrine and wor&s;hip, as well as
di&s;cipline, of that mighty hierarchy. He had formerly appealed from the pope
to a general council; but now, that a general council was &s;ummoned to meet at
Mantua, he previou&s;ly renounced all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to it, as being
&s;ummon|ed by the pope, and lying entirely under &s;ubjection to that
&s;piritual u&s;urper. He engaged his clergy to make a declaration to the like
purpo&s;e; and he had pre|&s;cribed to them many other alterations on ancient
tenets and practices. Cranmer took advantage of every opportunity to carry him
on in this cour&s;e; and while Queen Jane lived, who favoured the reformers, he
had, by means of her in&s;inua|tion and addre&s;s, been very &s;ucce&s;sful in
his endeavours. After her death, Gar|diner, <PB N="227" REF="232"> who was
returned from his emba&s;&s;y to France, kept the King more in &s;u&s;|pence;
and by feigning an unlimited &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will, he was frequently
able to guide him to his own purpo&s;es. Fox, bi&s;hop of Hereford, had
&s;upported Cran|mer in his &s;chemes for a more entire reformation; but his
death had made way for the promotion of Bonner, who, tho' he had hitherto
&s;eemed a furious enemy to the &s;ee of Rome, was determined to &s;acrifice
every thing to pre&s;ent intere&s;t, and had joined the confederacy of Gardiner
and the partizans of the old religion. Gar|diner him&s;elf, it was believed,
had &s;ecretly entered into mea&s;ures with the pope, and even with the
emperor; and in concert with the&s;e powers, he endeavoured to pre&s;erve, as
much as po&s;&s;ible, the ancient faith and wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>HENRY was &s;o much governed by pa&s;&s;ion, that nothing could
have retarded his animo&s;ity and oppo&s;ition again&s;t Rome, but &s;ome other
pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;topped his career, and rai&s;ed him new &s;ubjects of
animo&s;ity. Tho' he had gradually, &s;ince he came to years of maturity, been
changing the tenets of that theological &s;y&s;tem, in which he had been
educated, he was equally po&s;itive and dogmatical in the few articles which
remained to him, as if the whole fabric had continued entire and un&s;haken:
And tho' he &s;tood alone in his opinion, the flattery of courtiers had &s;o
enflamed his tyrannical arrogance, that he thought him&s;elf enti|tled to
regulate, by his own particular &s;tandard, the religious faith of the whole
nation. The point, where he chiefly placed his orthodoxy, happened to be the
real pre&s;ence; that very doctrine, in which, among the numberle&s;s victories
of &s;uper&s;tition over common &s;en&s;e, her triumph is the mo&s;t &s;ignal
and egregious. All departure from this principle he held to be heretical and
dete&s;table; and no|thing, he thought, would be more honourable for him, than,
while he broke off all connections with the Roman pontiff, to maintain, in this
e&s;&s;ential article, the purity of the catholic faith.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;putation with Lam|bert.</NOTE> THERE was
one Lambert<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. II. p. 396.</NOTE>, a
&s;chool-ma&s;ter in London, who had been que&s;|tioned for un&s;ound opinions
by archbi&s;hop Warham; but, upon the death of that prelate, and the changing
of councils at court, he had been relea&s;ed. Not terrified with the danger
which he had incurred, he &s;till continued to pro|mulgate his tenets; and
having heard Dr. Taylor, afterwards bi&s;hop of Lin|coln, defend in a &s;ermon
the corporal pre&s;ence, he could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing to Taylor his
di&s;&s;ent from that doctrine; and he drew up his objections under ten
&s;everal head. Taylor carried the paper to Dr. Barnes, who happened to be a
Lutheran, and who maintained, that, tho' the &s;ub&s;tance of bread and wine
remained in the &s;acrament, yet the real body and blood of Chri&s;t were there
al&s;o, and were, in a certain my&s;terious manner, incorporated with the
material ele|ments. <PB N="228" REF="233"> By the pre&s;ent laws and practice,
Barnes was no le&s;s expo&s;ed to the &s;take than Lambert; yet &s;uch was the
per&s;ecuting rage which prevailed, that he was determined to bring this man to
condign puni&s;hment; becau&s;e, in their common departure from the ancient
faith, he had dared to go one &s;tep farther than him|&s;elf. He engaged Taylor
to delate Lambert to Cranmer and Latimer, who, whatever their private opinion
might be on the&s;e points, were obliged to conform them&s;elves to the
&s;tandard of orthodoxy, e&s;tabli&s;hed by Henry. When Lambert was cited
before the&s;e prelates, they endeavoured to bend him to a recantation; and
they were &s;urprized, when, in&s;tead of compliance, he ventured to appeal to
the King.</P>
<P>THE King, not di&s;plea&s;ed with an opportunity, where he could
at once exert his &s;upremacy, and di&s;play his learning, accepted the appeal;
and was deter|mined to mix, in a very unfair manner, the di&s;putant with the
judge. Public notice was given, that he intended to enter the li&s;ts with this
&s;chool-ma&s;ter: Scaffolds were erected in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, for the
accommodation of the audi|ence: Henry appeared on his throne, accompanied with
all the en&s;igns of ma|je&s;ty: The prelates were placed on his right hand:
The temporal peers on his left. The judges and mo&s;t eminent lawyers had a
place a&s;&s;igned them behind the bi&s;hops: The courtiers of greate&s;t
di&s;tinction behind the peers: And in the mid&s;t of this &s;plendid
a&s;&s;embly was produced the unhappy Lambert, and he was required to defend
his opinions again&s;t his royal antagoni&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. II. p. 426.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter opened the conference, by &s;aying,
that Lambert, being charged with heretical pravity, had appealed from his
bi&s;hop to the King; as if he expected more favour from this application, and
as if the King could ever be induced to protect a heretic: That tho' his
maje&s;ty had thrown off the u&s;ur|pations of the &s;ee of Rome; had
di&s;incorporated &s;ome idle monks, who lived like drones in a beehive; had
remedied the idolatrous wor&s;hip of images; had publi&s;hed the bible in
Engli&s;h, for the in&s;truction of all his &s;ubjects; and had made &s;ome
le&s;&s;er alterations, which every one mu&s;t approve of; yet was he
de|termined to maintain the purity of the catholic faith, and to puni&s;h with
the ut|mo&s;t &s;everity all departure from it: And that he had taken the
pre&s;ent opportu|nity, before &s;o learned and grave an auditory, of
convincing Lambert of his er|rors; but if he &s;till per&s;evered ob&s;tinately
in them, he mu&s;t expect the mo&s;t con|dign puni&s;hment<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this preamble, which was not very encouraging, the King
a&s;ked Lam|bert, with a &s;tern countenance, what his opinion was of
Chri&s;t's corporal pre|&s;ence in the &s;acrament of the altar; and when
Lambert began his di&s;cour&s;e with <PB N="229" REF="234"> &s;ome compliment
to his maje&s;ty, he rejected the prai&s;e with di&s;dain and indigna|tion. He
afterwards pre&s;&s;ed Lambert with &s;ome arguments, drawn from &s;crip|ture
and the &s;choolmen: The audience applauded the force of his rea&s;oning, and
the extent of his erudition: Cranmer &s;econded his proofs by &s;ome new
topics: Gardiner entered the li&s;ts as a &s;upport to Cranmer: Ton&s;tal took
up the argument after Gardiner: Stoke&s;ley brought fre&s;h aid to Ton&s;tal:
Six bi&s;hops more appeared &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the field after Stocke&s;ley.
And the di&s;putation, if it de&s;erves the name, was prolonged for five hours;
till Lambert, fatigued, con|founded, brow-beaten, and aba&s;hed, was at la&s;t
reduced to &s;ilence. The King then, returning to the charge, a&s;ked him
whether he was convinced; and he propo&s;ed, as a concluding argument, this
intere&s;ting que&s;tion, whether he was re&s;olved to live or die? Lambert,
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that courage which con&s;i&s;ts in ob&s;tinacy, replied,
that he ca&s;t him&s;elf wholly on his maje&s;ty's clemency: The King told him,
that he would be no protector of heretics; and therefore, if that was his final
an&s;wer, he mu&s;t expect to be committed to the flames. Cromwel, as
vicegerent, read the &s;entence again&s;t him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier,

<Q REND="inline">"The King's maje&s;ty," &s;ays Cromwel, "for

<P>LAMBERT, who&s;e vanity had probably incited him the more to
per&s;evere on account of the greatne&s;s of this public appearance, was not
daunted by the ter|rors of that puni&s;hment, to which he was condemned. His
executioners took care to make the &s;ufferings of a man who had per&s;onally
oppo&s;ed the King, as cruel as po&s;&s;ible: He was burned at a &s;low fire;
his legs and thighs were con|&s;umed to the &s;tumps; and when there appeared
no end of his tortures, &s;ome of the guards, more merciful than the re&s;t,
lifted him on their halberts, and threw him into the flames, where he was
con&s;umed. While they were employed in this <PB N="230" REF="235"> friendly
office, he cried aloud &s;everal times, <HI>None but Chri&s;t, none but
Chri&s;t,</HI> and the&s;e words were in his mouth when he expired<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fox's acts and monuments, p. 427. Burnet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME few days before this execution, four Dutch anabapti&s;ts,
three men and a woman, had faggots tied to their backs at Paul's cro&s;s&punc;
and were burned in that manner. And a man and a woman of the &s;ame &s;ect and

<P><MILESTONE N="1539" UNIT="year"> IT was the unhappy &s;ituation
of the Engli&s;h, during that age, that when they laboured under any grievance,
they had not the &s;atisfaction of expecting redre&s;s from Parliament: On the
contrary, they had rea&s;on to dread each meeting of that a&s;&s;embly, and
were then &s;ure of having tyranny converted into law, and ag|gravated,
perhaps, with &s;ome circum&s;tance, which the arbitrary prince and his
mini&s;ters had not hitherto devi&s;ed, or did not think proper, of
them&s;elves, to carry into execution. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th April.</NOTE> This abject &s;ervility
never more eminently appeared than in a new Parliament, which the King now
a&s;&s;embled, and which, if he had &s;o plea&s;ed, might have been the la&s;t
that ever &s;at in England. But he found them too u&s;eful in&s;truments of
dominion ever to entertain thoughts of giving them a total exclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE chancellor opened the Parliament by informing the hou&s;e of
Lords, that it was his maje&s;ty's earne&s;t de&s;ire, to extirpate from his
kingdom all diver&s;ity of opinions with regard to religion; and as this
enterprize was difficult and impor|tant, he de&s;ired them to chu&s;e a
committee among them&s;elves, who might frame certain articles, and communicate
them afterwards to the Parliament. The lords named the vicar-general, Cromwel,
now created a peer, the archbi&s;hops of Can|terbury and York, the bi&s;hops of
Durham, Carli&s;le, Worce&s;ter, Bath and Wells, Bangor, and Ely. The hou&s;e
might have &s;een what a hopeful ta&s;k they were undertaking: This &s;mall
committee it&s;elf was agitated with &s;uch diver&s;ity of opi|nions, that it
could come to no conclu&s;ion. The duke of Norfolk then moved in the hou&s;e,
that, &s;ince there were no hopes of having a report from the com|mittee, the
articles of faith, propo&s;ed to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;hould be reduced to
&s;ix; and new committees be appointed to frame an act with regard to them. As
this peer was under&s;tood to &s;peak the King's mind, his motion was
immediately a&s;|&s;ented to; and, after a &s;hort prorogation, the bill of the
<HI>&s;ix articles,</HI> or the bloody bill, as the prote&s;tants ju&s;tly
termed it, was introduced, and having pa&s;&s;ed the two hou&s;es, had the
King's a&s;&s;ent affixed to it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Law of the &s;ix articles.</NOTE> IN this
law, the real pre&s;ence was e&s;tabli&s;hed, the communion in one kind, the
perpetual obligation of vows of cha&s;tity, the utility of private ma&s;&s;es,
the <PB N="231" REF="236"> celibacy of the clergy, the nece&s;&s;ity of
auricular confe&s;&s;ion. The denial of the fir&s;t article, with regard to the
real pre&s;ence, &s;ubjected the per&s;on to death by fire, and to the &s;ame
forfeiture as in ca&s;es of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rea&s;on; and admitted not the pri|vilege of abjuring: An unheard
of &s;everity, and unknown to the inqui&s;ition it|&s;elf. The denial of any of
the other five articles, even tho' recanted, was pu|ni&s;hable by the
forfeiture of goods and chattels, and impri&s;onment during the King's
plea&s;ure: An ob&s;tinate adherence to error, or a relap&s;e, was adjudged to
be felony, and puni&s;hable with death. The marriage of prie&s;ts was
&s;ubjected to the &s;ame puni&s;hment: Their commerce with women, for the
fir&s;t offence, was forfeiture and impri&s;onment; for the &s;econd, death.
Ab&s;taining from confe&s;|&s;ion, and from receiving the euchari&s;t at the
accu&s;tomed times, &s;ubjected the per&s;on to fine and impri&s;onment, during

was puni&s;hable by death and for&s;eiture, as in ca&s;es of felony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">31 Hen. VIII. c. 14. Herbert in Kennet, p. 219.</NOTE>.
Commi&s;&s;ioners were to be appointed by the King, for en|quiring into the&s;e
here&s;ies and irregular practices, and the criminals were to be tried by a
jury.</P>
<P>THE King, in framing this law, laid his oppre&s;&s;ive hand on
both parties; and even the catholics had rea&s;on to complain, that the friars
and nuns, tho' di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed their convent, &s;hould be capriciou&s;ly
re&s;trained to the practice of celibacy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There
is a &s;tory, that the duke of Norfolk, meeting, &s;oon after this act was
pa&s;&s;ed, one of his chaplains, who was &s;u&s;pected of favouring the

<Q REND="inline">"Now, Sir, what think you of the law to hinder

to the &s;everity of the act, the mi&s;ery of adver&s;aries, according to the
u&s;ual maxims of party, was regarded by the adherents to the ancient religion,
as their own pro&s;perity and triumph. Cran|mer had the courage to oppo&s;e
this bill in the hou&s;e; and tho' the King de&s;ired him to ab&s;ent
him&s;elf, he could not be prevailed on to give this proof of com|pliance<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 249, 270. Fox, vol. II. p.

being convinced of the general rectitude of his intentions, gave him an
unu&s;ual indulgence in that particular, and never allowed even a whi&s;per
again&s;t him. That prelate, however, was now obliged, in obedience to the
&s;tatute, to di&s;mi&s;s his wife, the niece of O&s;iander, a famous divine of
Nuremburg<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Herbert in Kennet, p. 210</NOTE>; and
Henry, &s;atisfied with this proof of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;howed him his former
countenance and favour. La|timer and Shaxton threw up their bi&s;hoprics, on
account of this law, and were committed to pri&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="237"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proclamations made equal to laws.</NOTE> THE
Parliament having thus re&s;igned all their eccle&s;ia&s;tical liberties,
proceeded to an entire &s;urrender of their civil; and without &s;cruple or
deliberation they made by one act a total &s;ubver&s;ion of the Engli&s;h
con&s;titution. They gave to the King's proclamations the &s;ame force as to a
&s;tatute enacted by Parliament; and to render the matter wor&s;e, if
po&s;&s;ible, they framed this law as if it were only declarative, and were
intended to explain the natural extent of the regal authority. The preamble
contains, that the King had formerly &s;et forth &s;everal proclamations, which
froward per&s;ons had wilfully contemned, not con&s;idering what a King by his
royal power may do; that this licence might encourage offen|ders not only to
di&s;obey the laws of Almighty God, but al&s;o to di&s;honour the King's mo&s;t
royal maje&s;ty, <HI>who may full ill bear it;</HI> that &s;udden emergencies
often occur, which require &s;peedy remedies, and cannot await the &s;low
a&s;&s;em|bling and deliberations of Parliament; and that, tho' the King was
empowered, by his authority, derived from God, to con&s;ult the public good on
the&s;e occa&s;i|ons, yet the oppo&s;ition of refractory &s;ubjects might
pu&s;h him to extremity and violence: For the&s;e rea&s;ons, the Parliament,
that they might remove all occa|&s;ion of doubt, a&s;certained by a &s;tatute
this prerogative of the crown, and en|abled his maje&s;ty, with the advice of
his council, to &s;et forth proclamations, en|joining obedience under whatever
pains and penalties he &s;hall think proper: And the&s;e proclamations were to
have the force of perpetual laws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">31 Hen. VIII.

<P>WHAT &s;hows either a &s;tupid or wilful blindne&s;s of the
Parliament; they pre|tended, even after this &s;tatute, to maintain &s;ome
limitations in the government; and they enacted, that no proclamation &s;hould
deprive any per&s;on of his lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, liberties,
inheritances, privileges, franchi&s;es; nor yet infringe any common law or
laudable cu&s;tom of the realm. They con&s;idered not, that no pains could be
inflicted on the di&s;obedience of proclamations, without invading &s;ome
liberty or property of the &s;ubject; and that the power of enacting new laws,
joined to the di&s;pen&s;ing power, then exerci&s;ed by the crown, amounted to
a full legi&s;lative authority. It is true, the Kings of England had been
always ac|cu&s;tomed, from their own authority, to i&s;&s;ue proclamations, and
to exact obedi|ence to them; and this prerogative was, no doubt, a &s;trong
&s;ymptom of ab&s;o|lute government: But &s;till there was a difference between
a power, which was exerci&s;ed on a particular emergence, and which mu&s;t be
ju&s;tified by the pre&s;ent expediency or nece&s;&s;ity; and an authority
conferred by a po&s;itive &s;tatute, which could no longer admit of controul or
limitation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>
COULD any act be more oppo&s;ite to the &s;pirit of liberty than this law, it
would have been another of the &s;ame parliament. They pa&s;&s;ed attainders,
not only <PB N="233" REF="238"> again&s;t the Marque&s;s of Exeter, the Lords
Montacute, Darcy, Hu&s;&s;ey, and others, who had been legally tried and
condemned; but al&s;o again&s;t &s;ome per&s;ons, of the highe&s;t quality, who
had never been accu&s;ed, or examined, or convicted. The violent hatred, which
Henry bore to cardinal Pole, had extended it&s;elf to all his friends and
relations; and his mother in particular, the counte&s;s of Sali&s;|bury, had,
on that account, become extremely obnoxious to him. She was al&s;o accu&s;ed of
having employed her authority with her tenants, to hinder them from peru&s;ing
the new tran&s;lation of the Bible; of having procured bulls from Rome, which,
'tis &s;aid, were found at Coudray, her country &s;eat; of having kept a
cor|re&s;pondence with her &s;on, the cardinal: But Henry found, either that
the&s;e of|fences could not be proved, or that they would not by law be
&s;ubject to &s;uch &s;e|vere puni&s;hment as he de&s;ired to inflict upon her.
He re&s;olved, therefore, to pro|ceed again&s;t her in a more &s;ummary and
more tyrannical manner; and for that purpo&s;e, he &s;ent Cromwel, who was but
too ob&s;equious to his will, to demand of the judges, whether the Parliament
could attaint a per&s;on, who was forth|coming, without giving him any trial,
or citing him to appear before them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coke's 4th In&s;t.
p. 37, 38.</NOTE>. The judges replied, that it was a dangerous que&s;tion, and
that the high court of Parliament ought to give examples to inferior courts of
proceeding according to ju&s;tice: No inferior court could act in that
arbitrary manner, and they thought that the parliament never would. Being
pre&s;&s;ed to give a more explicite an&s;wer, they replied, that, if a
per&s;on were attainted in that manner, the attainder could never after be
brought in que&s;tion, but mu&s;t remain good in law. Henry learned by this
deci&s;ion, that &s;uch a method of proceeding, tho' directly contrary to all
the principles of equity, was yet practicable; and this being all he was
anxious to know, he re&s;olved to employ it again&s;t the counte&s;s of
Sali&s;bury. Cromwel &s;howed to the hou&s;e of peers a banner, on which was
embroidered the five wounds of Chri&s;t, the &s;ymbol, cho&s;en by the northern
rebels; and this banner, he af|firmed, was found in the Counte&s;s's
hou&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer xiv. 652.</NOTE>. No other proof
&s;eems to have been produced, in order to a&s;certain her guilt: The
Parliament, without farther en|quiry, pa&s;&s;ed a bill of attainder again&s;t
her; and they involved in the &s;ame act, without any better proof, as far as
appears, Gertrude Marchione&s;s of Exeter, Sir Adrian Forte&s;cue, and Sir
Thomas Dingley. The&s;e two gentlemen were executed: The marchione&s;s was
pardoned, and &s;urvived the King; the counte&s;s received a reprieve.</P>
<P>THE only beneficial act, pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was that
by which the parliament confirmed the &s;urrender of the mona&s;teries; and yet
even this act contains much fal&s;hood, much tyranny, and were it not that all
private rights mu&s;t &s;ubmit to <PB N="234" REF="239"> public intere&s;t,
much inju&s;tice and iniquity. The &s;cheme of engaging the abbots&punc; to
make a &s;urrender of their mona&s;teries had been conducted, as may ea&s;ily
be imagined, with many invidious circum&s;tances: Arts of all kinds had been
em|ployed upon them; every motive, that could work on the frailty of human
nature, had been &s;et before them; and it was with great difficulty that
the&s;e dignified con|ventuals were brought to a conce&s;&s;ion, which mo&s;t
of them regarded as de&s;tructive of their intere&s;ts, as well as &s;acr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">legious and criminal in it&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier,
vol. ii. p. 158. &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>. Three abbots had &s;hown more con&s;tancy
than the re&s;t, the abbot of Colche&s;ter, of Reading, and of Gla&s;&s;enbury;
and in order to puni&s;h them for their oppo&s;ition, and make them an example
to others, means had been found to convict them of trea&s;on; they had
peri&s;hed by the hands of the executioner, and the revenues of the con|vents
had been forfeited<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">31 II. VIII. c. 10.</NOTE>.
Be&s;ides, tho' none of the&s;e violences had had place, the King knew, that a
&s;urrender made by men, who were only tenants for life, would not bear
examination; and he was therefore re&s;olved to make all &s;ure by his u&s;ual
expedient, an act of parliament. In the preamble to this act, the par|liament
a&s;&s;erts, that all the &s;urrenders, made by the abbots, had been, 
<Q REND="inline">"without con&s;traint, of their own accord, and
according to the due cour&s;e of common law."</Q> And in con&s;equence, the
parliament confirms the &s;urrenders, and a&s;cer|tains the property of the
abbey lands to the King and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors for ever<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">31 H. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>&punc; It is remarkable, that all the
mitred abbots &s;till &s;at in the hou&s;e of peers; and that none of them made
any prote&s;tation again&s;t this &s;tatute.</P>
<P>IN this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the rank of all the great officers of
&s;tate was fixed: Cromwel, as vicegerent, had the precedency a&s;&s;igned him
above all of them. It was thought &s;ingular, that a black-&s;mith's &s;on, for
he was no other, &s;hould have precedence next the royal family; and that a man
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no manner of literature, &s;hould be placed at the head of
the church.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the act of the &s;ix articles had pa&s;&s;ed, the
catholics were extremely vigilant to inform again&s;t offenders; and no le&s;s
than five hundred per&s;ons were in a little time thrown into pri&s;on. But
Cromwel, who had not had intere&s;t enough to prevent that act, was able, for
the pre&s;ent, to elude its execution. Seconded by the Duke of Suffolk, and
lord chancellor Audley, as well as Cranmer, he remon&s;trated again&s;t the
cruelty of puni&s;hing &s;o many delinquents; and he obtained permi&s;&s;ion to
&s;et them at liberty. The uncertainty of the King's humour gave each party an
opportunity of triumphing in its turn. No &s;ooner had Henry pa&s;&s;ed this
law, which &s;eemed to give &s;o deep a wound to the reformers, than he granted
a general permi&s;&s;ion, for every one to have the new tran&s;lation of the 
<PB N="235" REF="240"> Bible in his family: A conce&s;&s;ion regarded by that
party, as a mo&s;t important victory.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry's pro|jects of mar|riage.</NOTE> BUT as
Henry was ob&s;erved to be much governed by his wives, while he retained his
fondne&s;s for them, the final prevalence of either party, &s;eemed to depend
much on the choice of the future Queen. Immediately after the death of Jane
Seymour, the mo&s;t beloved of all his wives, he began to think of a new
marriage. He fir&s;t ca&s;t his eye on the dutche&s;s dowager of Milan, niece
to the Emperor; and he made propo&s;als for obtaining that alliance. But
meeting with difficulties in this de&s;ign, he was carried, by his friend&s;hip
for Francis, rather to think of a French prince&s;s. He demanded the dutche&s;s
dowager of Longueville, daughter of the Duke of Gui&s;e, a prince of the
hou&s;e of Lorraine; but Francis told him, that that lady was already betrothed
to the King of Scotland. The King, however, would not take a repul&s;e: He had
&s;et his heart extremely on the match: The information, which he had received,
of the dutche&s;s's accompli&s;hments and beauty, had prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him
in her favour; and having privately &s;ent over Meautys to examine her
per&s;on, and get certain intelligence of her conduct, the accounts, which that
agent brought him, &s;erved farther to inflame his de&s;ires. He learned, that
&s;he was big made; and he thought her, on that account, the more proper match
for him, who was now become &s;omewhat corpulent. The plea&s;ure too of
mortifying his nephew, whom he did not love, was a farther incitement to his
pro&s;ecution of this match; and he in&s;i&s;ted, that Francis &s;hould give
him the pre|ference to the King of Scots. But Francis, tho' &s;en&s;ible that
the alliance of Eng|land was of much greater importance to his intere&s;t,
would not affront his friend and ally; and to prevent farther &s;ollicitation,
he immediately &s;ent the Prince&s;s to Scotland. Not to &s;hock, however,
Henry's humour, Francis made him an offer of Mary of Bourbon, daughter of the
Duke of Vendome; but as the King was in|formed, that James had formerly
rejected this Prince&s;s, he would not hear any farther of &s;uch a propo&s;al.
The French monarch then offered him the choice of the two younger &s;i&s;ters
of the new Queen of Scots; and he a&s;&s;ured him, that they were no way
inferior either in merit or &s;ize to their elder &s;i&s;ter, and that one of
them was even &s;uperior in beauty. The King was as &s;crupulous with regard to
the per&s;on of his wives, as if his heart had been really &s;u&s;ceptible of a
deli|cate pa&s;&s;ion; and he was unwilling to tru&s;t any relations, or even
pictures, with regard to this important particular. He propo&s;ed to Francis,
that they &s;hould have a conference at Calais on pretence of bu&s;ine&s;s; and
that that monarch &s;hould bring along with h m the two Prince&s;&s;es of
Gui&s;e, together with the fine&s;t ladies of quality in France, that he might
make a choice among them. But the gal|lante &s;pirit of Francis was &s;hocked
with this propo&s;al; and he was impre&s;&s;ed with <PB N="236" REF="241"> too
much regard for the fair &s;ex, to carry ladies of the fir&s;t quality, like
geldings, to a market, there to be cho&s;en or rejected by the humour of the
merchant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Grand, vol. iii. p. 638.</NOTE>. Henry
would hearken to none of the&s;e niceties, but &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on his
propo&s;al; which, however, notwith&s;tanding Francis's earne&s;t de&s;ire of
continuing a good corre&s;pondence with him, was at la&s;t finally
rejected.</P>
<P>THE King began then to turn his thoughts towards a German
alliance; and as the princes of the Smalcaldic league were extremely
di&s;gu&s;ted again&s;t the Emperor on account of the per&s;ecution of their
religion, he hoped, by matching him&s;elf into one of their families, to renew
an amity, which he regarded as &s;o u&s;eful to him. Cromwel joyfully
&s;econded this intention; and propo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to him Anne of Cleves, who&s;e father, the duke of that name,
had great intere&s;t among the Lutheran prin|ces, and who&s;e &s;i&s;ter,
Sibylla, was married to the elector of Saxony, the head of the prote&s;tant
alliance. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He marries Anne of Cleves.</NOTE> A flattering
picture, drawn for the Prince&s;s by Hans Holben, determined Henry to apply to
her father; and after &s;ome negotiations, the marriage, notwith&s;tanding the
oppo&s;ition of the elector of Saxony, was at la&s;t concluded; and the
Prince&s;s was &s;ent over into England. The King, impatient to be &s;atisfied
with regard to the per&s;on of his bride, came privately to Roche&s;ter, and
got a &s;ight of her. He found her big, indeed, and tall, as he could wi&s;h;
but utterly devoid both of beauty and grace; very unlike the pictures and
re|pre&s;entations, which he had received: He &s;wore &s;he was a great
Flanders-mare; and declared, that he never could po&s;&s;ibly bear her any
affection. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;likes her.</NOTE> The matter was wor&s;e,
when he found, that &s;he could &s;peak no language but Dutch, of which he was
entirely ignorant; and that the charms of her conver&s;ation were not likely to
compen&s;ate for the homeline&s;s of her per&s;on. He returned to Greenwich
very melancholy; and much lamented his hard fate to Cromwel, as well as to Lord
Ru&s;&s;el, Sir Anthony Brown, and Sir Anthony Denny. This la&s;t gentle|man,
in order to give him comfort, told him, that his misfortune was common to
Kings, who could not, like private per&s;ons, choo&s;e for them&s;elves; but
mu&s;t receive their wives from the judgment and fancy of others.</P>
<P>IT was the &s;ubject of debate among the King's coun&s;ellors,
whether the mar|riage could not yet be broke; and the Prince&s;s be &s;ent back
to her own country. Henry's &s;ituation &s;eemed at that time very critical.
After the ten years truce, concluded between the Emperor and the king of
France, a good under&s;tanding &s;eemed to have taken place between the&s;e
rival monarchs; and &s;uch marks of union appeared, as gave great jealou&s;y to
the court of England. The Emperor, who knew the generous nature of Francis,
even put a confidence in him, which is rare, to that degree, among great
princes. An in&s;urrection had been rai&s;ed in the Low <PB N="237" REF="242">
Countries by the inhabitants of Ghent, and &s;eemed to threaten the mo&s;t
danger|ous con&s;equences. Charles, who re&s;ided at that time in Spain,
re&s;olved to go in per&s;on to Flanders, in order to appea&s;e the&s;e
di&s;orders; but he found great difficulties in contriving the manner of his
pa&s;&s;age thither. The road by Italy and Germany was tedious: The voyage
thro' the Channel dangerous, by rea&s;on of the Engli&s;h naval power: He
a&s;ked Francis's permi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s thro' his dominions; and he
entru&s;ted him&s;elf into the hands of a rival, whom he had &s;o mortally
offended. The French monarch received him at Paris, with great magnificence and
cour|te&s;y; and tho' prompted both by revenge and intere&s;t, as well as by
the advice of his mi&s;tre&s;s and favourites, to make advantage of the
pre&s;ent opportunity, he conducted the Emperor &s;afely out of his dominions;
and would not &s;o much as &s;peak to him of bu&s;ine&s;s during his abode in
France, le&s;t his demands &s;hould bear the air of violence upon his royal
gue&s;t.</P>
<P>HENRY, who was informed of all the&s;e particulars, believed
that an entire and cordial union had taken place between the&s;e two great
monarchs; and that their religious zeal might prompt them to fall with combined
arms upon Eng|land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 579.</NOTE>. An alliance
with the German princes &s;eemed now, more than ever, re|qui&s;ite for his
intere&s;t and &s;afety; and he knew, that, if he &s;ent back the Prin|ce&s;s
of Cleves, &s;uch an affront would be highly re&s;ented by her friends and
fa|mily. <MILESTONE N="1540" UNIT="year"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 January.</NOTE> He was therefore re&s;olved,
notwith&s;tanding his aver&s;ion to her, to com|plete the marriage; and he told
Cromwel, that, &s;ince matters had gone &s;o far, he mu&s;t put his neck into
the yoke. Cromwel, who knew how much his own intere&s;t was concerned in this
affair, was very anxious to learn from the King, next morning after the
marriage, whether he now liked his &s;pou&s;e any better. The King told him,
that he hated her wor&s;e than ever; and that her per&s;on was more loth&s;ome
on a near approach: He was re&s;olved never to meddle with her; and even
&s;u&s;pected her not to be a true maid: A point, about which he had
entertained an extreme delicacy. He continued however to be civil to Anne; he
even &s;eemed to repo&s;e his u&s;ual confidence in Cromwel; but tho' he
exerted this command over his temper, a di&s;content lay lurking in his
brea&s;t, and was ready to bur&s;t out on the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">12 April.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> A &s;e&s;&s;ion of
Parliament was held; and none of the abbots were now allowed a place in the
hou&s;e of peers. The King, by the mouth of the chancellor, com|plained to the
Parliament of the great diver&s;ity of religions, which &s;till pre|vailed
among his &s;ubjects: A grievance, he &s;aid, which ought the le&s;s to be
en|dured; becau&s;e the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">riptures were now publi&s;hed in Engli&s;h, and ought
uni|ver&s;ally to be the &s;tandard of belief to all mankind. But he had
appointed, he <PB N="238" REF="243"> &s;aid, &s;ome bi&s;hops and divines to
draw up a li&s;t of tenets, to which his people were to a&s;&s;ent; and he was
determined, that Chri&s;t, the doctrine of Chri&s;t, and the truth &s;hould
have the victory. The King &s;eems to have expected more effect in
a&s;certaining truth, from this new book of his doctors, than had en&s;ued from
the publication of the &s;criptures. Cromwel, as vicar general, made al&s;o in
the King's name a &s;peech to the upper hou&s;e; and the peers, in return,
be&s;towed &s;uch flattery on him, that they &s;aid he was worthy, by his
de&s;ert, to be vicar ge|neral of the univer&s;e. That mini&s;ter &s;eemed to
be no le&s;s in his ma&s;ter's good graces: He received, &s;oon after the
&s;itting of the Parliament, the title of Earl of E&s;&s;ex, and was
in&s;talled knight of the garter.</P>
<P>THERE remained only one religious order in England; the knights
of St. John of Jeru&s;alem, or the knights of Malta, as they are commonly
called. This or|der, partly eccle&s;ia&s;tical, partly military, had, by their
valour, done great &s;er|vice to Chri&s;tendom; and had very much retarded, at
Jeru&s;alem, Rhodes, and Malta, the rapid progre&s;s of the barbarians. During
the general &s;urrender of the religious hou&s;es in England, they had exerted
their &s;pirit, and had ob&s;ti|nately refu&s;ed to yield up their revenues to
the King; and Henry, who would endure no &s;ociety that profe&s;&s;ed obedience
to the pope, was obliged to have re|cour&s;e to the Parliament for the
di&s;&s;olution of this order. Their revenues were large; and formed an
addition no way contemptible to the many acqui&s;itions, which the King had
already made. But he had very ill hu&s;banded the great revenue obtained by the
plunder of the church: His profu&s;e genero&s;ity di&s;&s;i|pated fa&s;ter than
this rapacity could &s;upply; and the Parliament were &s;urprized this
&s;e&s;&s;ion to find a new demand made upon them of four tenths and a
&s;ub&s;idy of one &s;hil ing in the pound during two years: So ill were the
people's expec|tations an&s;wered, that the crown was never more to require any
&s;upply from the people. The commons, tho' lavi&s;h of their liberty, and of
the blood of their fellow &s;ubjects, were extremely frugal of their money; and
it was not without difficulty that that grant could be obtained by this
ab&s;olute and dreaded monarch. The convocation gave the King four &s;hillings
in the pound to be levied in two years. The pretext for the&s;e grants was the
great expence, which Henry had been put to for the defence of the nation, in
building forts along the &s;ea coa&s;t, and in equipping a navy. As he had at
pre&s;ent no ally on the Continent, in whom he repo&s;ed much confidence, he
relied only on his dome&s;tic &s;trength, and was on that account obliged to be
more expen&s;ive in his preparations again&s;t the dangers of an
inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE King's favour to Cromwel, and his acquie&s;cence in the
marriage of Anne of Cleves, were b th of them deceitful appearances: His
aver&s;ion to the Queen &s;ecretly encrea&s;ed every day; and having at la&s;t
broke all re&s;traint, it prompted <PB N="239" REF="244"> him at once to &s;eek
the di&s;&s;olution of a marriage &s;o odious to him, and to in|volve his
mini&s;ter in ruin, who had been the author of it. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fall of Crom|well.</NOTE> The fall of Cromwel
was ha&s;tened by other cau&s;es. All the nobility hated a man, who, being of
&s;uch ba&s;e extraction, had not only mounted above them by his &s;tation of
vicar ge|neral, but had engro&s;&s;ed many of the other con&s;iderable offices
of the kingdom: Be&s;ides that commi&s;&s;ion, which gave him a high, and
almo&s;t ab&s;olute authority over the clergy, and even over the laity, he was
Lord privy &s;eal, Lord cham|berlain, and Ma&s;ter of the wards: He had al&s;o
obtained the order of the garter, a dignity which had ever been conferred only
on the mo&s;t illu&s;trious families, and which &s;eemed to be profaned by its
being communicated to &s;o mean a per|&s;on. The people were aver&s;e to him,
as the &s;uppo&s;ed author of the violences on the mona&s;teries;
e&s;tabli&s;hments, which were &s;till revered and beloved by the commonalty.
The catholics regarded him as the concealed enemy of their reli|gion: The
prote&s;tants, ob&s;erving his exterior concurrence with all the
per&s;ecu|tions exerci&s;ed again&s;t them, were inclined to bear him as little
favour; and re|proached him with the timidity, if not treachery, of his
conduct. And the King, who found, that great clamours had on all hands arifen
again&s;t the admini&s;tra|tion, was not di&s;plea&s;ed to throw on Cromwel the
load of public hatred, and he hoped, by &s;o ea&s;y a &s;acri&s;ice, to regain
the affections of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>BUT there was another cau&s;e, which &s;uddenly &s;et all
the&s;e motives in action, and brought about an unexpected revolution in the
mini&s;try. The King had fixed his affection on Catherine Howard, niece to the
Duke of Norfolk; and be|ing determined to gratify this new pa&s;&s;ion, he
could find no other expedient but by procuring a divorce from his pre&s;ent
con&s;ort, to rai&s;e Catherine to his bed and throne. The Duke, who had long
been engaged in enmity with Cromwel, made the &s;ame u&s;e of her
in&s;inuations, to ruin that mini&s;ter, that he had formerly done of Anne
Boleyn's again&s;t Wol&s;ey: And when all engines were prepared, he obtained a
commi&s;&s;ion from the King, to arre&s;t Cromwel at the council-board on the
accu&s;ation of high trea&s;on, and to commit him to the Tower. Immediately
after, a bill of attainder was framed again&s;t him; and the hou&s;e of peers
thought proper, without trial, examination, or evidence, to condemn to death a
man, whom, a few days before, they had declared worthy to be vicar general of
the univer&s;e. The hou&s;e of commons pa&s;&s;ed the bill, tho' not without
&s;ome oppo|&s;ition. Cromwel was accu&s;ed of here&s;y and trea&s;on; but the
in&s;tances of his trea&s;onable practices are utterly improbable, or even
ab&s;olutely ridiculous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 278.</NOTE>.
The only circum&s;tance of his conduct, by which he &s;eems to have merited
this fate, <PB N="240" REF="245"> was his being the in&s;trument of the King's
tyranny, in conducting like iniquitous bills, in the former &s;e&s;&s;ion,
again&s;t the counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury and others.</P>
<P>CROMWEL endeavoured to &s;often the King by the mo&s;t humble
&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">pplications; but all to no
purpo&s;e: It was not the practice of that Prince to ruin his mini&s;ters and
favourites by halves; and tho' the unhappy pri&s;oner wrote once in &s;o moving
a &s;train as even to draw tears from his eyes, he hardened him&s;elf again&s;t
all move|ments of pity, and refu&s;ed his pardon. The conclu&s;ion of Cromwel's
letter ran in the&s;e words. 
<Q REND="inline">"I a mo&s;t woful pri&s;oner, am ready to
&s;ubmit to death when it &s;hall plea&s;e God and your maje&s;ty; and yet the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">His execution.</NOTE> When brought to
exe|cution, he avoided all earne&s;t prote&s;tations of his innocence, and all
complaints again&s;t the &s;entence pronounced upon him. He knew that Henry
would re&s;ent on his &s;on the&s;e &s;ymptoms of oppo&s;ition to his will, and
that his death alone would not terminate that monarch's vengeance. He was a man
of prudence, indu&s;try, and ability; worthy of a better ma&s;ter and of a
better fate. Tho' rai&s;ed to the &s;ummit of power from a very low origin, he
betrayed no in&s;olence or contempt of his inferiors; and was careful to
remember all the obligations, which, during his lower fortune, he had owed to
any one. He had &s;erved as a private &s;entinel in the Italian wars, where he
received &s;ome good office from a Lucque&s;e merchant, who had entirely forgot
his per&s;on, as well as the &s;ervice, which he had rendered him. Cromwel, in
his grandeur, happened, at London, to ca&s;t his eye on his benefactor, now
reduced to poverty, by misfortunes. He immediately &s;ent for him, put him in
mind of their antient friend&s;hip, and by his grateful a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
re-in&s;tated him in his former pro&s;perous circum&s;tances<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 172</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King's di|vorce from Anne of Cleves.</NOTE>
THE mea&s;ures for divorcing the King from Anne of Cleves, were carried on at
the &s;ame time with the bill of attainder again&s;t Cromwel. The hou&s;e of
peers, in conjunction with the commons, applied to him by petition, de&s;iring
that he would allow his marriage to be examined; and orders were immediately
given to lay the matter before the convocation. Anne had been formerly
con|tracted by her father to the Duke of Lorrain; but &s;he, as well as the
Duke, were at that time under age, and the contract had been afterwards
annulled by the con&s;ent of both parties. The King, however, pleaded this
contract as a ground of divorce; and he added two rea&s;ons more, which may
&s;eem a little extraor|dinary; that, when he e&s;pou&s;ed Anne, he had not
inwardly given his con&s;ent, <PB N="241" REF="246"> and that he had not
con&s;ummated the marriage. The convocation were &s;atisfied with the&s;e
rea&s;ons, and &s;olemnly annulled the marriage between the King and Queen: The
Parliament ratified the deci&s;ion of the clergy<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">To &s;how how much Henry &s;ported with law and common &s;en&s;e;

Anne Boleyn and Anne of Cleves. But the King's intention in this law is &s;aid
to be a de&s;ign of re&s;toring the prince&s;s Elizabeth to her right of
le|gitimacy; and it was his character never to look farther than the pre&s;ent

<P>ANNE was ble&s;t with a happy in&s;en&s;ibility of temper, even
in the points which the mo&s;t nearly affect her &s;ex; and the King's
aver&s;ion towards her, as well as his pro&s;ecution of the divorce, had never
given her the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s. She willingly hearkened to terms of
compo&s;ition with him; and when he offered to adopt her as his &s;i&s;ter, to
give her place next the Queen, and his own daughter, and to make a &s;ettlement
of three thou&s;and pounds a year upon her; &s;he accept|ed the conditions, and
gave her con&s;ent to the divorce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 458,

&s;he had been very well u&s;ed in England, and de&s;ired him to live on good

that &s;he refu&s;ed to return into her own country after the affront which
&s;he had received; and &s;he lived and died in England.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING Anne's moderation, this incident produced a
great cold|ne&s;s between the King and the German princes; but as the
&s;ituation of Europe was now much altered, Henry was the more indifferent to
their re&s;entment. The clo&s;e intimacy which had taken place between Francis
and Charles, had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted during a very &s;hort time: The
di&s;&s;imilarity of their characters &s;oon renewed, with greater violence
than ever, their former jealou&s;y and hatred. While Charles re|mained at
Paris, Francis had been imprudently engaged, by his open temper, and by that
&s;atisfaction which a noble mind naturally feels in performing generous
actions, to make &s;ome very dangerous confidences to that intere&s;ted
monarch; and having now lo&s;t all &s;u&s;picion of his rival, he hoped, that
the emperor and he, &s;upporting each other, might neglect every other
alliance. He not only communicated to his gue&s;t the &s;tate of his
negociations with Sultan Solyman and the Venetians: He al&s;o laid open the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ollicitations which he had
received from <PB N="242" REF="247"> the court of England, to enter into a
confederacy again&s;t him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel, Du
Tillet.</NOTE>. Charles had no &s;ooner reached his own dominions, than he
&s;hewed him&s;elf unworthy of the friendly reception which he had met with. He
flatly refu&s;ed to execute his pro|mi&s;e, and put the duke of Orleans in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Milane&s;e: He informed So|lyman, and the &s;enate of
Venice, of the treatment which they had received from their ally: And he took
care that Henry &s;hould not be ignorant how willingly Francis had abandoned
his ancient friend, to whom he owed &s;uch important ob|ligations, and had
&s;acrificed him to a new confederate: He even poi&s;oned and
mi&s;repre&s;ented many things, which the un&s;u&s;pecting heart of the French
mo|narch had di&s;clo&s;ed to him. Had Henry po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed true judgment
and genero&s;ity, this incident alone had been &s;ufficient to guide him in the
choice of his allies. But his domineering pride carried him immediately to
renounce the friend&s;hip of Francis, who had &s;o unexpectedly given the
emperor the preference: And as Charles invited him to a renewal of ancient
amity, he willingly accepted the offer; and thinking him&s;elf &s;ecure in this
alliance, he neglected the friend&s;hip both of France and of the German
princes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8th Augu&s;t.</NOTE> THE new turn which Henry
had taken with regard to foreign affairs, was ex|tremely agreeable to his

their antagoni&s;ts. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His marriage with Cathe|rine Howard.</NOTE>
The marriage of the King with Catherine Howard, which followed &s;oon after his
divorce from Anne of Cleves, was al&s;o regarded as a very favourable incident
to their cau&s;e; and the &s;ub&s;e|quent events corre&s;ponded perfectly to
their expectations. The King's councils being now directed by Norfolk and
Gardiner, a &s;urious per&s;ecution commenced again&s;t the prote&s;tants; and
the law of the &s;ix articles was executed with rigour. Dr. Barnes, who had
been the cau&s;e of Lambert's execution, felt, in his turn, the &s;everity of
the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit; and, by a bill which pa&s;&s;ed in parliament,
without trial, he was condemned to the flames, together with Jerome and
Ger|rard. He di&s;cu&s;&s;ed theological que&s;tions even at the &s;take; and
as the debate be|tween him and the &s;heriff, turned upon the invocation of
&s;aints, he &s;aid, that he doubted whether the &s;aints could pray for us;
but if they could, he hoped in half an hour, to be praying for the &s;heriff

&s;ubjection, and infu&s;ed terror into every brea&s;t. Barnes, Gerrard, and
Jerome had been carried to the place of execution on three hurdles; and along
with them there was placed on each hurdle a catholic, who was al&s;o exe|cuted
for his religion. The&s;e catholics were Abel, Fether&s;tone, and Powel, who
declared, that the mo&s;t grievous part of their puni&s;hment was the being
coupled to &s;uch heretical mi&s;creants as &s;uffered with them<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Saunders de &s;chi&s;m. Angl.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h &s;eemed to be totally &s;unk
under the de&s;potic power of Henry, there appeared &s;ome &s;ymptoms of
di&s;content: An incon|&s;iderable in&s;urrection broke out in York&s;hire,
headed by Sir John Nevil; but it was &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and Nevil, with
the other ringleaders, was executed. The rebels were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been
in&s;tigated by the intrigues of cardinal Pole; and the King was in&s;tantly
determined to make the counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury &s;uffer for her &s;on's
offences. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">27 May.</NOTE> He ordered her to be carried to
the place of execution, and this venerable matron maintained &s;till, in
the&s;e di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances, the &s;pirit of that long race of
monarchs from whom &s;he was de&s;cended<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> p

her head on the block, or &s;ubmit to a &s;entence where &s;he had received no
trial. She told the executioner, that, if he would have her head, he mu&s;t win
it the be&s;t way he could: And thus &s;haking her venerable grey locks, &s;he
ran about the &s;caffold; and the executioner followed her with his ax, aiming
many fruitle&s;s blows at her neck, before he was able to give her the fatal
&s;troke. Thus peri&s;hed the la&s;t of the line of Plantagenet, which, with
great glory, but &s;till greater crimes and misfortunes, had governed England
for the &s;pace of three hundred years. The lord Leonard Grey, a man who had
formerly rendered great &s;ervice to the crown, was al&s;o beheaded for
trea&s;on, &s;oon after the counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury. We know little of the
grounds of his pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>THE in&s;urrection in the North engaged Henry to make a
progre&s;s thither, in order to quiet the minds of his people, to reconcile
them to his government, and to aboli&s;h the ancient &s;uper&s;titions, to
which tho&s;e parts were much addicted. He had al&s;o another motive for this
journey: <MILESTONE N="1541" UNIT="year"> He propo&s;ed to hold a conference
at York with his nephew the King of Scotland, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to cement a

&s;ame &s;pirit of religious innovation, which had &s;eized the other parts of
Europe, had made its way into Scotland, and had begun, long before this period,
to exci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> the same jealou&s;ies,
fears, and per&s;ecutions. About the year 1527, Patrick Hamilton, a young man
of a noble family, having been created abbot of Ferne, was &s;ent abroad for
his education; but had fallen into company with &s;ome reformers, and he
returned into his own country very ill di&s;po&s;ed to|wards that church, of
which his birth and his merit entitled him to attain the highe&s;t honours. The
fervour of youth, and his zeal for novelty, made it impo&s;&s;ible for him to
conceal his &s;entiments; and Campbel, prior of the Domi|nicans, who, under
colour of friend&s;hip, and a &s;ympathy in opinion, had in&s;i|nuated
him&s;elf into his confidence, delated him to Beaton, archbi&s;hop of St.
An|drews. Hamilton was invited to St. Andrews, in order to maintain, with
&s;ome of the clergy, a di&s;pute concerning the controverted points; and after
much rea|&s;oning with regard to ju&s;tification, freewill, original
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">in, and other topics of that
nature, the conference ended with their condemning Hamilton to be burnt for his
errors. The young man, who had been deaf to the in&s;inuations of ambition, was
le&s;s likely to be &s;haken with the fears of death, while he propo&s;ed to
him&s;elf both the glory of bearing te&s;timony to the truth, and the immediate
reward at|tending his martyrdom. The people, who compa&s;&s;ionated his youth,
his virtue, and his noble birth, were much moved with the con&s;tancy of his
end; and the event &s;till more confirmed them in their favourable &s;entiments
towards him. He cited Campbel, who &s;till in&s;ulted him at the &s;take, to
an&s;wer before the judg|ment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t; and as that per&s;ecutor,
either a&s;toni&s;hed with the&s;e events, or overcome with remor&s;e, or,
perhaps, &s;eized with a di&s;temper, &s;oon after lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es, and
fell into a fever, of which he died; the people regarded Hamil|ton as a
prophet, as well as a martyr<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood's
Hi&s;t, church of Scotland, p. 62.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMONG the di&s;ciples converted by Hamilton, was one friar
Forre&s;t, who became a zealous preacher; and who, tho' he did not openly
di&s;cover his &s;entiments, was &s;u&s;pected to lean towards the new
opinions. His dioce&s;an, the bi&s;hop of Dunkel, enjoined him, when he met
with a good epi&s;tle or good go&s;pel, which favoured the liberties of holy
church, to preach on it, and let the re&s;t alone. Forre&s;t an|&s;wered, that
he had read both old and new re&s;tament, and had not found an ill epi&s;tle,
or ill go&s;pel in any part of them. The extreme attachment to the
&s;crip|tures was regarded in tho&s;e days as a &s;ure characteri&s;tic of
here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y; and Forre&s;t was &s;oon
after brought to his trial, and condemned to the flames. While the prie&s;ts

<P>THE clergy were at that time reduced to great difficulties, not
only in Scot|land, but all over Europe. As the reformers aimed at a total
&s;ubver&s;ion of anci|ent e&s;tabli&s;hments, which they repre&s;ented as
idolatrous, impious, dete&s;table, the prie&s;ts, who found both their honours
and properties at &s;take, thought that they had a right to re&s;i&s;t, by
every extremity, the&s;e dangerous invaders, and that the &s;ame &s;imple
principles of equity, which ju&s;tified a man in killing a pyrate or a robber,
would acquit them for the execution of &s;uch heretics. A toleration, tho' it
is never acceptable to ecclefia&s;tics, might, they &s;aid, be admitted in
other ca&s;es; but &s;eemed an ab&s;urdity where fundamentals were &s;haken,
and where the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and even the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the
e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy were brought in danger. But tho' the church was thus
carried by policy, as well as inclination, to kindle the fires of
per&s;ecution, they found the &s;ucce&s;s of this remedy very precarious, and
ob&s;erved, that the enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal of the reformers, inflamed by
puni&s;h|ment, was apt to prove very contagious on the compa&s;&s;ionate minds
of the &s;pectators. The new doctrine, amid&s;t all the dangers to which it was
expo&s;ed, &s;pread it&s;elf &s;ecretly every where; and the minds of men were
gradually di&s;|po&s;ed to a revolution in religion.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ymptom for the clergy in Scotland
was, that the no|bility, moved by the example of England, had ca&s;t a
wi&s;tful eye on the church revenues, and hoped, if a reformation took place,
to enrich them&s;elves by the plunder of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics. James
him&s;elf, who was very poor, and was &s;omewhat inclined to magnificence,
particularly in building, had been &s;wayed by like motives; and began to
threaten the clergy with the &s;ame fate which at|tended them in the
neighbouring country. Henry al&s;o, never cea&s;ed exhorting his nephew to
imitate his example; and being moved both by the pride of mak|ing pro&s;elytes,
and the pro&s;pect of &s;ecurity, if Scotland &s;hould embrace a clo&s;e union
with him, he &s;ollicited the King of Scots to meet him at York; and he
obtained a promi&s;e to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE eccle&s;ia&s;tics were extremely alarmed with this
re&s;olution of James; and they employed every expedient, in order to prevent
it. They repre&s;ented the dangers of innovation; the pernicious con&s;equences
of aggrandizing the nobility, already too powerful; the hazard of putting
him&s;elf into the hands of the Engli&s;h, his hereditary enemies; the
dependance which mu&s;t en&s;ue upon lo&s;ing the friend|&s;hip of France, and
all foreign potentates. To the&s;e con&s;iderations, they added the pro&s;pect
of pre&s;ent intere&s;t, by which they found the King to be much go|verned: 
<PB N="246" REF="251"> They offered him a pre&s;ent gratuity of fifty
thou&s;and pounds Scots: They promi&s;ed him, that the church &s;hould always
be ready to contribute to his &s;upply: And they pointed out to him, the

adding a hundred thou&s;and pounds a year to the crown revenues<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. XIV. Drummond in Ja. 5. Pit&s;coti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, ibid. Knox.</NOTE>. The
in&s;inuations of his new Queen, to whom youth, beauty, and addre&s;s had given
a powerful influence over him, &s;econded all the&s;e rea&s;ons; and James was
at la&s;t engag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d, fir&s;t to delay
his journey, then to &s;end excu&s;es to the King of England, who had already
come to York, in order to be pre&s;ent at the conference.</P>
<P>HENRY, vexed with the di&s;appointment, and enraged at the
affront, vowed vengeance again&s;t his nephew; and he began, by permitting
pyracies at &s;ea, and incur&s;ions at land, to put his threats in execution.
But he received &s;oon after, in his own family, an affront to which he was
much more &s;en&s;ible, and which touch|ed him in a point where he had always
&s;hewn an extreme delicacy. He had thought him&s;elf very happy in his new
marriage: The youth, beauty, and agreeable di&s;po&s;ition of Catherine, had
entirely captivated his affections; and he made no &s;ecret of his devoted
attachment to her. He had even put up a prayer in his chappel, returning thanks
to heaven for the felicity which the conjugal &s;tate afforded him; and he
de&s;ired the bi&s;hop of Lincoln to compo&s;e a form of thank&s;|giving for
that purpo&s;e. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;covery of the Queen's crimes.</NOTE> But
the Queen very little merited this tenderne&s;s which he bore her: She had
abandoned her&s;elf to lewdne&s;s. One La&s;celles brought in|telligence of her
di&s;&s;olute life to Cranmer, and told him, that his &s;i&s;ter, formerly a
&s;ervant in the old dutche&s;s of Norfolk's family, with whom Catherine was
edu|cated, had given him a particular a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">count of all her di&s;orders. Derham and Mannoc, both of them
&s;ervants of the dutche&s;s, had been admitted to her bed; and &s;he had even
taken little care to conceal her &s;hame from the other &s;ervants of the
family. The primate, &s;truck with this intelligence, which it was equally
dangerous to conceal or to di&s;cover, communicated the matter to the earl of
Hert|ford and to the chancellor. They agreed, that the matter &s;hould by no
means be buried in &s;ilence; and the archbi&s;hop him&s;elf &s;eemed the
mo&s;t proper per&s;on to di&s;clo&s;e it to the King. Cranmer, unwilling to
&s;peak on &s;o delicate a &s;ubject, wrote a narrative of the whole, and
conveyed it to Henry, who was infinitely a&s;toni&s;hed at the intelligence. So
confident was he of the fidelity of his con&s;ort, that he gave at fir&s;t no
credit to the information; and he &s;aid to the lord privy|&s;eal, to lord
Ru&s;&s;el, high admiral, Sir Anthony Brown, and Wriothe&s;ley, that he
regarded the whole as a forgery. Cranmer was now in a very perilous
&s;itua|tion; and had not full proofs been found, certain and inevitable
de&s;truction hung <PB N="247" REF="252"> over him. The King's impatience,
however, and jealou&s;y prompted him to &s;earch the matter to the bottom: The
privy-&s;eal was ordered to examine La&s;|celles, who per&s;i&s;ted in the
information he had given; and &s;till appealed to his &s;i&s;ter's te&s;timony.
That nobleman made next a pretence of hunting, and went to Su&s;&s;ex, where
the woman at that time re&s;ided: He found her both con&s;tant in her former
intelligence, and particular as to the facts; and the whole bore but too much
the face of probability. Mannoc and Derham, who were arre&s;ted at the &s;ame
time, and examined by the chancellor, made the Queen's guilt entirely certain
by their confe&s;&s;ion; and di&s;covered other particulars, which redounded
&s;till more to her di&s;honour. Three ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ds of the family were admitted into her &s;ecrets; and &s;ome of
them had even pa&s;t the night in bed with her and her lovers. All the
examinations were laid before the King, who was &s;o deeply affected, that he
remained a long time &s;peechle&s;s, and at la&s;t bur&s;t into tears. The
Queen be|ing now que&s;tioned, denied her guilt; but when informed, that a full
di&s;covery was made, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;he had been criminal before
her marriage; and only in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;he had never been fal&s;e to the
King's bed. But as there was evidence, that one Colepeper had pa&s;&s;ed the
night with her alone &s;ince her mar|riage; and as it appeared, that &s;he had
taken Derham, her old paramour, into her &s;ervice; &s;he &s;eemed to de&s;erve
very little credit in this a&s;&s;everation; and the King be&s;ides, was not of
a di&s;po&s;ition to make any difference between the&s;e de|grees of guilt.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1542" UNIT="year"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 January.</NOTE> HENRY found, that he could
not &s;o fully or expeditiou&s;ly &s;atiate his vengeance on all the&s;e
criminals as by a&s;&s;embling a Parliament, the u&s;ual in&s;trument of his
tyranny. The two hou&s;es, having received the Queen's confe&s;&s;ion, began by
an addre&s;s to the King; which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal particulars. They
entreated him not to be vexed with this untoward accident, to which all men
were &s;ubject; but to con&s;ider the frailty of human nature, and the
mutability of human affairs; and from the&s;e views to derive a &s;ubject of
con&s;olation. They de&s;ired leave to frame a bill of attainder again&s;t the
Queen and her accomplices; and they begg|ed him to give his a&s;&s;ent to this
bill, not in per&s;on, which would renew his vexa|tion, and might endanger his
health, but by commi&s;&s;ioners appointed for that purpo&s;e. And as there was
a law in force, making it trea&s;on to &s;peak ill of the Queen, as well as
King, they craved his royal pardon, if any of them &s;hould, on the pre&s;ent
occa&s;ion, have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed any part of that &s;tatute.</P>
<P>HAVING obtained a gracious an&s;wer to the&s;e reque&s;ts, the
Parliament proceeded to an act of attainder for trea&s;on again&s;t the Queen,
and the vi&s;counte&s;s of Rocheford, who had conducted her &s;ecret amours;
and in this act Colepeper, <PB N="248" REF="253"> and Derham, were al&s;o
comprized. At the &s;ame time, they pa&s;&s;ed a bill of attainder for
mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on again&s;t the old dutche&s;s of Norfolk,
Ca|therine's grandmother, her uncle, lord William Howard, and his lady,
toge|ther with the counte&s;s of Bridgewater, and nine per&s;ons more;
becau&s;e they knew the Queen's vicious life before her marriage, and yet
concealed it. This was an effect of Henry's u&s;ual extravagance, to expect
that parents &s;hould &s;o far forget the ties of natural affection, and the
&s;entiments of &s;hame and decency, as to reveal to him the mo&s;t &s;ecret
di&s;orders of their family. He him&s;elf &s;eems to have been &s;en&s;ible of
the cruelty of this &s;entence: For he pardoned the dutche&s;s of Norfolk, and
mo&s;t of the others, condemned for mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to &s;ecure him&s;elf for the future, as well as his
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors, from this fatal accident, he engaged the Parliament to frame
a law, equally full of extra|vagance. It was enacted, that any one, who knew,
or vehemently pre&s;umed any guilt in the Queen, and did not, within twenty
days, di&s;clo&s;e it to the King or council, &s;hould be guilty of trea&s;on;
prohibiting every one, at the &s;ame time, from &s;preading the matter abroad,
or even privately whi&s;pering it to others. It was al&s;o enacted, that if the
King married any woman, who had been incontinent, taking her for a true maid,
&s;he &s;hould be guilty of trea&s;on, in ca&s;e &s;he did not previou&s;ly
reveal her guilt to him. The people made merry with this extra|ordinary
clau&s;e, and &s;aid, that the King mu&s;t henceforth look out for a widow; for
no reputed maid would ever be per&s;waded to incur the penalty of the
&s;tatute<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 314.</NOTE>. After all
the&s;e laws were pa&s;&s;ed, the Queen was beheaded on Tower-hill, toge|ther
with the lady Rocheford. They behaved in a manner &s;uitable to their
di&s;|&s;olute life; and as the lady Rocheford was known to be the chief
in&s;trument, who had brought Anne Boleyn to her end, &s;he died unpitied; and
men were farther confirmed, by the di&s;covery of this woman's guilt, in the
favourable &s;en|timents which they had entertained of that unfortunate
Queen.</P>
<P>THE King made no demand of any &s;ub&s;idies from this
Parliament; but he found means of enriching his exchequer from another quarter:
He took far|ther &s;teps towards the di&s;&s;olution of colleges, ho&s;pitals,
and other foundations of that nature. The courtiers had been practi&s;ing on
the pre&s;idents and governors, to make a &s;urrender of their revenues to the
King; and they had been &s;ucce&s;sful with eight of them. But there was an
ob&s;tacle to their farther progre&s;s: It had been provided, by the local
&s;tatutes of mo&s;t of the&s;e foundations, that no pre&s;i|dent, nor any
fellows, could make &s;uch a deed without the unanimous vote of all the
fellows; and this con&s;ent was not ea&s;ily obtained. All &s;uch &s;tatutes
were now annulled by Parliament; and the revenues of the&s;e hou&s;es, &s;o
u&s;eful to the <PB N="249" REF="254"> <MILESTONE N="1541" UNIT="year">
public, were now laid open to the rapacity of the King and his favourites<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was enacted by this Parliament, that there &s;hould be
trial of trea&s;on in any country where the King &s;hould appoint by
commi&s;&s;ion. The &s;tatutes of trea&s;on had been extremely multiplied in
this reign; and &s;uch an expedient &s;aved trouble and charges in trying that
crime. The &s;ame Parliament erected Ireland into a kingdom; and Henry
henceforth annexed the title of King of Ireland to his other titles. This
&s;e&s;&s;ion, the commons fir&s;t began the practice of freeing any of their
members, who were arre&s;ted, by a writ i&s;&s;ued by the &s;peaker. Formerly
it was u&s;ual for them to apply for a writ from chancery to that purpo&s;e.

had been &s;o long their prey, that nobody was &s;urprized at any new inroads
made upon it. From the regular, Henry now proceeded to make de|va&s;tations on
the &s;ecular clergy. He extorted from many of the bi&s;hops a &s;ur|render of
chapter lands; and by this devi&s;e he pillaged the &s;ees of Canterbury, York,
and London, and enriched his greedy para&s;ites and flatterers with their
&s;poils.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs.</NOTE> THE clergy
have been commonly &s;o fortunate as to make a concern for their temporal
intere&s;ts go hand in hand with a jealou&s;y for orthodoxy; and both the&s;e
pa&s;&s;ions be regarded, by the people, ignorant and &s;uper&s;titious, as a
zeal for religion: But the violent and head&s;trong character of Henry now
disjoined the&s;e objects. His rapacity was gratified by plundering the church;
his bi|gotry and arrogance by per&s;ecuting heretics. Tho' he engaged the
Parliament to mitigate the penalties of the &s;ix articles, &s;o far as regards
the marriage of prie&s;ts, which was now only &s;ubjected to a forfeiture of
goods, chattles, and lands during life; he was &s;till equally bent on
maintaining a rigid purity in &s;peculative principles. He had appointed a
commi&s;&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of the two archbi&s;hops and &s;everal bi&s;hops
of both provinces, together with a con&s;iderable number of doctors of
divinity; and by virtue of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;upremacy he had given them
in charge to choo&s;e a religion for his people. Before the com|mi&s;&s;ioners
had made any progre&s;s in this arduous undertaking, the Parliament, in 1541,
had pa&s;&s;ed a law, by which they ratified all the tenets, which the&s;e
di|vines &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h with the King's con&s;ent: And they were not
a&s;hamed of expre&s;sly declaring that they took their religion upon tru&s;t,
and had no other rule, in religious as well as temporal concerns, than the
arbitrary will of their ma&s;ter. There is only one clau&s;e of the &s;tatute,
which may &s;eem to &s;avour &s;ome|what of the &s;pirit of liberty: It was
enacted, that the eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h
nothing repugnant to the laws and &s;tatutes of the realm. But in reality this
provi&s;o was in&s;erted by the King, to &s;erve his own purpo&s;es. By
introducing a confu&s;ion and contradiction into the laws, he became more the 
<PB N="250" REF="255"> ma&s;ter of every one's life and property. And as the
antient independance of the church &s;till gave him jealou&s;y, he was well
plea&s;ed, under cover of &s;uch a clau&s;e, to introduce appeals from the
&s;piritual to the civil courts. It was for a like rea&s;on, he would never
promulgate a body of canon law&punc; and encouraged the judges on all
occa&s;ions to interpo&s;e in eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es wherever they thought
the law or royal prerogative concerned. A happy innovation; tho' at fir&s;t
invented for arbitrary purpo&s;es!</P>
<P>THE King, armed by the authority of Parliament, or rather by
their acknow|legement of that &s;piritual &s;upremacy, which he believed
inherent in him, em|ployed his commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;elect a &s;y&s;tem of
tenets for the a&s;&s;ent and belief of the nation. A &s;mall volume was &s;oon
after publi&s;hed, called, the <HI>In&s;titution of a Chri&s;tian Man,</HI>
which was received by the convocation, and voted to be the in|fallible
&s;tandard of orthodoxy. All the delicate points of ju&s;tification, faith,
free|will, good works, and grace, are there defined, with a leaning towards the
opi|nion of the reformers: The &s;acraments, which a few years before were only
al|lowed to be three, are now encrea&s;ed to the number of &s;even, conformable
to the &s;entiments of the catholics. The King's caprice is di&s;cernible thro'
the whole; and the book is in reality to be regarded as his compo&s;ition. For
Henry, while he made his opinion a rule for the nation, would tye his own hands
by no canon or authority, not even by any which he him&s;elf had formerly
e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE people had occa&s;ion &s;oon after to &s;ee a farther
in&s;tance of the King's in|con&s;tancy. He was not long &s;atisfied with his
In&s;titution of a Chri&s;tian Man: He ordered a new book to be compo&s;ed,
called, the <HI>Erudition of a Chri&s;tian Man;</HI> and without a&s;king the
a&s;&s;ent of the convocation, he publi&s;hed, by his own au|thority, and that
of the Parliament, this new model of orthodoxy. It differs from the
in&s;titution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 190.</NOTE>; but the
King was no le&s;s po&s;itive in his new creed than he had been in the old; and
he required the belief of the nation to veer about at his &s;ignal. In both
the&s;e books, he was particularly careful to inculcate the doctrine of
pa&s;&s;ive obedience; and he was no le&s;s careful to retain the nation in the
practice.</P>
<P>WHILE the King was &s;preading his own books among the people,
he &s;eems to have been extremely perplexed, as well as the clergy, what
cour&s;e to take with the &s;criptures. A review had been made by the
eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ynod of the new tran&s;lation of the Bible; and Gardiner
had propo&s;ed, that, in&s;tead of em|ploying Engli&s;h expre&s;&s;ions
throughout, &s;everal Latin words &s;hould &s;till be pre|&s;erved, becau&s;e
they contained, as he pretended, &s;uch peculiar energy and &s;igni|ficance,
that they had no corre&s;pondent terms in the vulgar tongue<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 315.</NOTE>. Among the&s;e were <HI>ecle&s;ia,
paenitentia, pontifex, contritus, holocau&s;ta, &s;acramentum, elementa,</HI> 
<PB N="251" REF="256"> <HI>ceremonia, mu&s;terium, pre&s;byter, &s;acrificium,
humilitas, &s;atisfactio, peccatum, gratia, ho&s;tia, charitas,</HI> &amp;c.
But as this mixture would have appeared extremely bar|barous, and was plainly
calculated for no other purpo&s;e than to retain the people in their antient
ignorance, the propo&s;al was rejected. The knowledge of the peo|ple, however,
at lea&s;t their di&s;putative turn, &s;eemed to be an inconvenience &s;till
more dangerous; and the King and Parliament<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Which met on the 22d of January, 1543.</NOTE>, &s;oon after the
publication of the &s;criptures, retracted the conce&s;&s;ion, which they had
formerly made; and prohibited all but gentlemen and merchants to peru&s;e
them<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">33 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>. Even that
liberty was not granted, without an apparent he&s;itation, and a dread of the
con&s;equences: The&s;e per&s;ons were allowed to read, <HI>&s;o it be done
quietly and with good order.</HI> And the preamble to the act &s;ets forth, 
<Q REND="inline">"that many &s;editious and ignorant per&s;ons
had abu&s;ed the liberty granted them for reading the Bible, and that great
diver&s;ity of opinions, animo&s;ities, tumults, and &s;chi&s;ms had been
occa&s;ioned by perverting the &s;en&s;e of the &s;criptures."</Q> It &s;eemed
very difficult to reconcile the King's model for uniformity, with the
permi&s;&s;ion of free enquiry.</P>
<P>THE ma&s;s book al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed under the King's cognizance;
and little alteration was as yet made in it: Some doubtful or fictitious
&s;aints only were &s;truck out; and the name of the pope was erazed. This
latter precaution was likewi&s;e u&s;ed with regard to every new book, that was
printed, or even old book that was &s;old. The word, Pope, was carefully
omitted or blotted out<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary Hi&s;tory,
vol. iii. p. 113.</NOTE>; as if that precaution could aboli&s;h the term from
the language, or as if &s;uch a per&s;ecution of it did not rather imprint it
more &s;trongly in the memory of the people.</P>
<P>THE King took care about this time to clear the churches of
another abu&s;e, which had crept into them. Plays, interludes, and farces were
there often acted in deri&s;ion of the former &s;uper&s;titions; and the
reverence of the multitude for their antient principles and modes of wor&s;hip,
was thereby gradually effaced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p.
318.</NOTE>. We do not hear, that the catholics attempted to retaliate by
employing this powerful engine again&s;t their adver&s;aries, or endeavoured by
like arts to expo&s;e that fana|tical &s;pirit, by which, it appears, the
reformers were often actuated. Perhaps the people were not di&s;po&s;ed to
reli&s;h a je&s;t on that &s;ide: Perhaps the greater &s;implicity and the more
&s;piritual ab&s;tract wor&s;hip of the prote&s;tants, gave le&s;s hold to
ridicule, which is commonly founded on &s;en&s;ible repre&s;entations. It was,
therefore, a very agreeable conce&s;&s;ion, which Henry made the catholic
party, to &s;uppre&s;s entirely the&s;e religious comedies.</P>
<P>THUS Henry laboured ince&s;&s;antly, by arguments, creeds, and
penal &s;tatutes, to bring his &s;ubjects to an uniformity in their religious
&s;entiments: But as he en|tered, <PB N="252" REF="257"> him&s;elf, with the
greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, into all the&s;e &s;chola&s;tic rea&s;onings, he
encouraged the people, by his example, to apply them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of
theology; and it was in vain afterwards to expect, however pre&s;ent fear might
re|&s;train their tongues or pens, that they would cordially agree in any &s;et
of tenets or opinions pre&s;cribed to them.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1542" UNIT="year"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> HENRY, being
determined to avenge him&s;elf of the King of Scots for flighting the advances,
which he made for his friend&s;hip, would gladly have ob|tained a &s;upply from
the Parliament, to enable him to pro&s;ecute that enterprize; but as he did not
think it prudent to di&s;cover his intentions, the Parliament, con|formable to
their frugal maxims, would under&s;tand no hints; and the King was
di&s;appointed in his expectations. He continued, however, to make preparations
for war; and &s;o &s;oon as he thought him&s;elf in a condition to invade
Scotland, he publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, by which he endeavoured to ju&s;tify
his ho&s;tilities. He complained of James's di&s;appointing him in the
promi&s;ed interview; which was the real ground of the quarrel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14. Drummond in James the fifth.</NOTE>: But
in order to give a more &s;pecious co|louring to the enterprize, he mentioned
other injuries; that his nephew had given protection to &s;ome Engli&s;h rebels
and fugitives, and had detained &s;ome territory, which, Henry pretended,
belonged to England. He even revived the old claim of the dependance of the
crown of Scotland, and he &s;ummoned James to do ho|mage to him as his liege
lord and &s;uperior. He employed the duke of Norfolk, whom he called the
&s;courage of the Scots, to command in the war; and tho' James &s;ent the
bi&s;hop of Aberdeen, and Sir James Learmont of Dar&s;ay, to ap|pea&s;e his
uncle, he would hearken to no terms of accommodation. While Nor|folk was
a&s;&s;embling his army at Newca&s;tle, Sir Robert Bowes, attended with 
<PB N="253" REF="258"> Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Ralph Evers, Sir Brian Latoun, and
others, made an in|cur&s;ion into Scotland, and advanced towards Jedburgh, with
an intention of pil|laging and de&s;troying that town. The earl of Angus, and
George Douglas, his brother, who had been &s;o many years bani&s;hed their
country, and had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by Henry's bounty, joined the Engli&s;h army
in this incur&s;ion; and the forces, commanded by Bowes, exceeded four
thou&s;and men. James had not been ne|gligent in his preparations for defence,
and had po&s;ted a con&s;iderable body, un|der the command of the earl of
Huntley, for the protection of the borders. Lord Hume, at the head of his
clients, was ha&s;tening to join Huntley, when he met with the Engli&s;h army;
and a battle immediately en&s;ued. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th Augu&s;t.</NOTE> While they were engaged,
the forces under Huntley began to appear; and the Engli&s;h, afraid of being
overpowered and &s;urrounded, took to flight, and were pur&s;ued by the enemy.
Evers, Latoun, and &s;ome other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, were taken
pri|&s;oners. A few only of &s;mall note fell in this &s;kirmi&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Norfolk, mean while, began to move from his camp at
New|ca&s;tle; and being attended by the earls of Shrew&s;bury, Derby,
Cumberland, Surrey, Hertford, Rutland, with many others of the nobility, he
advanced to the borders. His army amounted to above twenty thou&s;and men; and
it re|quired the utmo&s;t efforts of Scotland to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch formidable
preparations. James had a&s;&s;embled his whole military force at Fala and
Sautrey, and was ready to advance &s;o &s;oon as he &s;hould be informed of
Norfolk's invading his kingdom. The Engli&s;h pa&s;&s;ed the Tweed at Berwic,
and advanced along the banks of the river as far as Kel&s;o; but hearing that
James had gathered together near thirty thou&s;and men, they repa&s;&s;ed the
river at that village, and retreated into their own country<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14.</NOTE>. The King of Scots, inflamed with a
de&s;ire of military glory, and of revenge on his invaders, gave the &s;ignal
for pur&s;uing them, and carrying the war into England. He was &s;urprized to
find, that his nobility, who were generally di&s;affected on account of the
preference, which he had given the clergy, oppo&s;ed this re&s;olution, and
refu&s;ed to attend him in his projected enterprize. Enraged at this defection,
he reproached them with cowardice, and threatened vengeance; but &s;till
re&s;olved, with the forces which adhered to him, to make an impre&s;&s;ion on
the enemy's country. He &s;ent ten thou&s;and men to the we&s;tern borders, who
entered England at Solway firth; and he him&s;elf followed them at a &s;mall
di&s;tance, ready to join them upon occa&s;ion. Di&s;gu&s;ted, however, with
the refractory di&s;po&s;ition of his nobles, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to the
army, depriv|ing lord Maxwel, their general, of his commi&s;&s;ion, and
conferring the com|mand on Oliver Sinclair, a private gentleman, who was his
favourite. The <PB N="254" REF="259"> army were extremely di&s;plea&s;ed with
this alteration, and were ready to di&s;band; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 November. Victory at Solway.</NOTE> when a
&s;mall body of Engli&s;h appeared, not exceeding 500 men, under the com|mand
of Dacres and Mu&s;grave. A panic &s;eized the Scotch, who immediately took to
flight, and were pur&s;ued by the enemy. Few were killed in this rout; for it
was no action; but a great many were taken pri&s;oners, and &s;ome of the
prin|cipal nobility. Among the&s;e were the earls of Ca&s;&s;ilis and
Glencairn; the lords Maxwel, Fleming, Sommerville, Oliphant, Grey, who were all
&s;ent to London, and given in cu&s;tody to different noblemen.</P>
<P>THE King of Scots, hearing of this di&s;a&s;ter, was confounded
to the la&s;t de|gree; and being naturally of a melancholy di&s;po&s;ition, as
well as endowed with a high &s;pirit, he lo&s;t all command of his temper on
this di&s;mal occa&s;ion. Rage again&s;t his nobility, who, he believed, had
betrayed him; &s;hame for a defeat by &s;uch unequal numbers; regret of the
pa&s;t, fear of the future; all the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions &s;o wrought upon him,
that he would admit of no con&s;olation, but aban|doned him&s;elf wholly to
de&s;pair. His body was wa&s;ted by &s;ympathy with his anxious mind; and even
his life began to be thought in danger. He had no child living; and hearing
that his Queen was &s;afely delivered, he a&s;ked whether &s;he had brought him
a male or female? Being told, the latter; he turned about in his bed: 
<Q REND="inline">"The crown came with a woman," &s;aid he, "and
it will go with one: Many mi&s;eries await this poor kingdom: Henry will make
it his own either by force of arms or by marriage."</Q> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th of De|cember.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of James the fifth.</NOTE>A few days
after, he expired, in the flower of his age; a prince of con&s;iderable virtues
and talents, well fitted, by his vigilance and per&s;onal courage, for
repre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e di&s;orders, to which his king|dom, during that age, was
&s;o much expo&s;ed. He executed ju&s;tice with the greate&s;t impartiality and
rigour; but as he &s;upported the commonalty and the church again&s;t the
rapine of the nobility, he e&s;caped not the hatred of that order. The
prote&s;tants al&s;o, whom he repre&s;&s;ed, have endeavoured to throw many
&s;tains on his memory; but have not been able to fix any con&s;iderable
imputation on him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The per&s;ecutions, exerci&s;ed
during James's reign, are not to be a&s;cribed to his bigotry, a vice of which
he &s;eems to have been as free as Francis the fir&s;t or the emperor Charles,
both of whom, as well as James, &s;hewed, in different periods of their lives,
even an inclination to the new doctrines. The extremities to which all the&s;e
princes were carried, proceeded entirely from the &s;ituation of affairs,
during that age, which rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for them to act with greater
temper or moderation, after they had embraced the re&s;olution of &s;upporting
the antient e&s;tabli&s;hments. So violent was the propen&s;ity of the times
towards innovation, that a toleration of the new preachers was equivalent to a
formed de&s;ign of changing the national religion. And even the greate&s;t
friends to liberty of con&s;cience have admitted, that tho' a &s;ect, which has
already diffu&s;ed it&s;elf, has a ju&s;t claim to indulgence, yet may it often
be con&s;i&s;tent with equity as well as found policy, to repre&s;s by
&s;everity the fir&s;t beginnings of &s;chi&s;m and new &s;y&s;tems of
theology.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="260"> <MILESTONE N="1543" UNIT="year"> HENRY
was no &s;ooner informed of his victory and of the death of his ne|phew, than
he projected, as James had fore&s;een, the &s;cheme of uniting Scotland to his
own dominions, by marrying his &s;on, Edward, to the heire&s;s of that
king|dom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 584. Herbert, Burnet,

pri&s;oners; and af|ter reproaching them, in &s;evere terms, for their breach
of treaty, as he pretended, he began to &s;often his tone, and propo&s;ed to
them this expedient, by which, he hoped, tho&s;e di&s;orders, &s;o prejudicial
to both &s;tates, would for the future be pre|vented. He offered to be&s;tow on
them their liberty without ran&s;om; and only required of them engagements to
favour the marriage of the Prince of Wales with their young mi&s;tre&s;s. They
were ea&s;ily prevailed on to give their a&s;&s;ent to a propo&s;al, which
&s;eemed &s;o natural, and &s;o advantageous to both kingdoms; and being
conducted to Newca&s;tle, they delivered to the duke of Norfolk, ho&s;ta|ges
for their return, in ca&s;e the intended nuptials were not compleated: And they
thence proceeded to Scotland, where they found affairs in &s;ome
confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE pope, finding his authority in Scotland expo&s;ed to danger
from the &s;pread|ing of the new opinions, had be&s;towed on Beaton, the
primate, the dignity of cardinal; and that prelate had been long regarded as
prime mini&s;ter to James, and as the head of that party, which defended the
antient privileges and proper|ties of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics. Upon the death of
his ma&s;ter, this man, apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;equences both to his party
and him&s;elf, endeavoured to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the power; and for
that purpo&s;e, he is accu&s;ed of executing a deed which re|quired a high
degree of temerity. He forged, it is &s;aid, a will for the King, appointing

<P>JAMES earl of Arran, of the name of Hamilton, was next heir to
the crown by his grandmother, daughter to James the third; and on that account
&s;eemed be&s;t entitled to po&s;&s;e&s;s that high office, into which the

was able to turn the ballance in his favour. The earl of Angus, and his
brother, having taken the pre&s;ent opportunity of returning into their own
country, oppo&s;ed the cardinal with all the force of that powerful family; and
the majority of the conven|tion had now embraced oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts to
tho&s;e which formerly prevailed. Arran was declared governor; the cardinal was
committed to cu&s;tody under the care of lord Seton; and a negotiation was
commenced with Sir Ralph Sadler, the Eng|li&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, for the
marriage of the infant Queen with the Prince of Wales. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty with Scotland.</NOTE> The following
conditions were quickly agreed on; that the Queen &s;hould remain in Scotland
till &s;he was ten years of age; that &s;he &s;hould then be &s;ent to England

&s;uch di&s;mal calamities, &s;eemed to be fully compo&s;ed, and to be changed
into perpetual concord and unanimity.</P>
<P>BUT the cardinal-primate, having prevailed on Seton to re&s;tore
him to his liberty, was able, by his intrigues, to confound all the&s;e
mea&s;ures, which ap|peared to be &s;o well concerted. He a&s;&s;embled the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable eccle&s;ia&s;tics; and having repre&s;ented to them the
imminent danger, to which their revenues and privileges were expo&s;ed, he
per&s;waded them to collect privately from the clergy a large &s;um of money,
by which, if entru&s;ted to his management, he promi&s;ed to overturn the
&s;chemes of their enemies<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib.
15.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides the partizans, whom he acquired by pecuniary motives, he
rouzed up the zeal of tho&s;e, who were attached to the catholic wor&s;hip; and
he repre&s;ented the union with Eng|land as the &s;ure forerunner of ruin to
the church and the antient religion. The national antipathy of the Scotch
again&s;t the Engli&s;h nation, was al&s;o an infallible engine, by which the
cardinal wrought upon the people; and tho' the terror of Henry's arms, and
their inability to make re&s;i&s;tance, had procured a temporary a&s;&s;ent to
the alliance and marriage propo&s;ed, the &s;ettled habits of the nation
pro|duced an extreme aver&s;ion to tho&s;e mea&s;ures. The Engli&s;h
amba&s;&s;ador and his train received many in&s;ults from per&s;ons whom the
cardinal had incited to commit tho&s;e indignities, in hopes of bringing on a
rupture. But Sadler very prudently di&s;|&s;embled <PB N="257" REF="262"> the
matter, and waited patiently till the day appointed for the delivery of the
ho&s;tages. He then demanded of the regent the performance of that im|portant
article; but received for an&s;wer, that his authority was very precari|ous,
that the nation had now taken a different impre&s;&s;ion, and that it was not
in his power to compel any of the nobility to deliver them&s;elves as
ho&s;tages to the Engli&s;h. Sadler, fore&s;eeing the con&s;equence of this
refu&s;al, &s;ent a &s;ummons to all tho&s;e who had been pri&s;oners in
England, and required them to fulfil the pro|mi&s;e which they had given of
returning into cu&s;tody. None of them &s;howed &s;o much &s;entiment of
honour, as to perform their engagements, except Gilbert Kennedy, earl of
Ca&s;&s;ilis. Henry was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the behaviour of this
nobleman, that he not only received him graciou&s;ly, but honoured him with
pre&s;ents, gave him his liberty, and &s;ent him back to Scotland, with his two
brothers, whom he had left as ho&s;tages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib.
XV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New rupture.</NOTE> THIS behaviour of the
Scotch nobles, tho' it reflected di&s;honour on the na|tion, was not
unacceptable to the cardinal, who fore&s;aw, that all the&s;e per&s;ons would
now be deeply intere&s;ted to maintain their enmity and oppo&s;ition to the
Engli&s;h. And as a war was &s;oon expected with that kingdom, he found it
nece&s;&s;ary immediately to apply to France, and to crave the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of that ancient ally, during the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Scotch
nation. Tho' Francis was fully &s;en|&s;ible of his intere&s;t in &s;upporting
Scotland, a demand of aid could not have been made on him at a more
un&s;ea&s;onable juncture. His preten&s;ions on the Milane&s;e, and his
re&s;entment again&s;t Charles, had engaged him in a war with that potentate;
and having made very great, tho' fruit'e&s;s efforts during the preceding
campaign, he was the more di&s;abled at pre&s;ent from defending his own
dominions, much more from granting any &s;uccour to the Scotch. Mathew Stuart,
earl of Lenox, a young nobleman of a great family, was at that time in the
French court; and Francis, being informed, that he was engaged in ancient and
hereditary enmity with the Hamiltons, who had murdered his father, &s;ent him
over to his native country, as a &s;upport to the cardinal and the Queen
mother: And he promi&s;ed, that a &s;upply of money, and, if nece&s;&s;ary,
even military &s;uccours, &s;hould &s;oon be di&s;patched after him. Arran, the
governor, &s;eeing all the&s;e preparations again&s;t him, a&s;&s;embled his
friends, and made an attempt to get the per&s;on of the infant Queen into his
cu&s;tody; but being repul&s;ed, he was obliged to come to an accommodation

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupture with France.</NOTE> THE oppo&s;ition
which Henry met with in Scotland from the French intrigues, excited his
re&s;entment, and farther confirmed the re&s;olution which he had before taken,
of breaking with France, and of uniting his arms with tho&s;e of the emperor.
He had other grounds of complaint again&s;t the French King; which, tho' they
were not of great importance, yet being recent, were able to overballance
tho&s;e great injuries which he had formerly received from Charles. He
pretended, that Francis had engaged to imitate his example in &s;eparating
him&s;elf entirely from the &s;ee of Rome, and that he had broke his promi&s;e
in that particular. He was di&s;|&s;atisfied, that James, his nephew, had been
allowed to marry, fir&s;t Magdalene of France, then a prince&s;s of the hou&s;e
of Gui&s;e; and he con&s;idered the&s;e alliances as pledges which Francis gave
of his intentions to &s;upport the Scotch again&s;t the power of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel.</NOTE>. He had been informed of &s;ome railleries,
which the French King had thrown out again&s;t his conduct with regard to his
wives. He was di&s;|gu&s;ted, that Francis, after &s;o many obligations which
he owed him, had &s;acri|ficed him to the emperor; and, in the confidence of
friend&s;hip, had ra&s;hly re|vealed his &s;ecrets to that &s;ubtle and
intere&s;ted monarch. And he complained, that regular payments were never made
of the &s;ums due to him by France, and of the pen&s;ion which had been
promi&s;ed. Impelled by all the&s;e motives, he alienated him&s;elf from his
ancient friend and confederate, and formed a league with the emperor, who very
earne&s;tly courted his alliance. This league, be&s;ides &s;tipulations for
mutual defence, contained a plan for invading France; and the two monarchs
agreed to enter Francis's dominions with an army, each of twenty|five
thou&s;and men; and to require that prince to pay Henry all the &s;ums which he
owed him, and to con&s;ign Boulogne, Montreuil, Terouenne, and Ardres, as a
&s;ecurity for the regular payment of his pen&s;ion for the future: In ca&s;e
the&s;e conditions were rejected, the confederate princes agreed, to challenge,
for Henry, the crown of France, and the dutchies of Normandy, Aquitaine, and
Guienne; for Charles, the dutchy of Burgundy, and &s;ome other territories<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIV. p. 768. XV. 2.</NOTE>. That they might
have a pretence for enforcing the&s;e claims, they &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to
Francis, requiring him to renounce his alliance with Sultan Solyman, and to
make repa|ration for all the prejudice which Chri&s;tendom had &s;uffered from
that unnatural confederacy. Upon the French King's refu&s;al, war was declared
again&s;t him by the confederates. It may be proper to ob&s;erve, that the
partizans of France object|ed to Charles his alliance with the heretical King
of England, as no le&s;s odious <PB N="259" REF="264"> than that which Francis
had contracted with Solyman: And they ob&s;erved, that this league was a breach
of that &s;olemn promi&s;e which he had given to Cle|ment the &s;eventh, never
to make peace or alliance with England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">22 January.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> WHILE the treaty with the
emperor was negociating, the King &s;ummoned a new &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament,
in order to obtain &s;upplies for his projected war with France. The Parliament
granted him a &s;ub&s;idy to be paid in three years: It was levied in a
peculiar manner; but exceeded not three &s;hillings in the pound upon any
individual<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">They who were worth in goods twenty
&s;hillings and upwards to five pounds, paid four pence of every pound; from
five pounds to ten pounds, eight pence; from ten pounds to twenty pounds,
&s;ix|teen pence; from twenty and upwards, two &s;hillings. Lands, fees, and
annuities, paid eight pence in the pound from twenty &s;hillings to five
pounds; from five pounds to ten pounds, &s;ixteen pence; from ten pounds to
twenty pounds, two &s;hillings; from twenty pounds and upwards, three
&s;hillings.</NOTE>. The convocation gave the King &s;ix &s;hillings in the
pound, to be levied in three years. Greater &s;ums were always, even during the
e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the catholic religion, exacted from the clergy than the
laity: Which made the emperor Charles &s;ay, when Henry di&s;&s;olved the
mona&s;teries, and &s;old their revenues, or be&s;towed them on his nobility
and courtiers, that he had killed the hen which brought him the golden
eggs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p. 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament al&s;o facilitated the execution of the former
law, by which the King's proclamations were made equal to &s;tatutes: They
appointed, that any nine coun&s;ellors &s;hould form a legal court for
puni&s;hing all di&s;obedience to pro|clamations. The total abolition of juries
in criminal cau&s;es, as well as of all Parliaments, &s;eemed, if the King had
&s;o plea&s;ed, the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of this enormous law. He might
i&s;&s;ue proclamations, for the execution of any penal &s;tatutes, and
afterwards try the criminals, not for breach of the law, but for di&s;obedience
to his proclamation. It is remarkable, that the lord Mountjoy en|tered a
prote&s;t again&s;t this &s;tatute; and it is equally remarkable, that that
pro|te&s;t is the only one which was entered again&s;t any public bill during
this whole reign<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 322.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE have taken notice, in the end of the former chapter, of
&s;ome laws re|garding religion, which the Parliament pa&s;&s;ed this
&s;e&s;&s;ion, in order to gratify the King's humour. It was farther
enacted<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">34 &amp; 35 Hen. VIII. c. 1</NOTE>, that
every &s;piritual per&s;on, who preached or taught contrary to the doctrine
contained in the King's book, the <HI>Erudition of a chri&s;tian man,</HI> or
contrary to any doctrine which he &s;hall hence|forth promulgate, was to be
admitted on the fir&s;t conviction to renounce his errors; on the &s;econd, he
was required to carry a faggot; which if he refu&s;ed to do, or fell into a
third offence, he was to be burnt. But the laity, for the third of|fence, were
only to forfeit their goods and chattels, and to be liable to perpetual

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o bring witne&s;&s;es for his
p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">gation. The&s;e penalties were
lighter than tho&s;e formerly impo&s;ed on a denial of
tran&s;ub&s;tantiation&punc; It was, however, &s;ubjoined in this &s;tatute,
that the act of the &s;ix articles was &s;till in force. But in order to make
the King more entirely ma&s;ter of his people, it was en|acted, that he might
hereafter, at his plea&s;ure, change this act, or any provi&s;ion in it. By
this clau&s;e, both parties were retained in &s;ubjection&punc; &s;o far as
regarded religion, the King was inve&s;ted, in the fulle&s;t manner, with the
&s;ole legi&s;lative autho|rity in his kingdom; and all his &s;ubjects were,
under the &s;evere&s;t penalties, ex|pre&s;sly bound to receive implicitly,
whatever doctrine he &s;hould plea&s;e to recom|mend to them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">12th July.</NOTE> THE reformers began to
entertain hopes, that this exorbitant power would be employed in their favour.
The King married Catherine Par, widow to Nevil lord Latimer; a woman of virtue,
and &s;omewhat inclined to the new doctrine. By this marriage, Henry made good
what had formerly been foretold in je&s;t, that he would be obliged to
e&s;pou&s;e a widow. The King's league with the emperor, &s;eemed to be a
circum&s;tance no le&s;s favourable to the catholic party; and thus matters
remained &s;till nearly ballanced between the factions.</P>
<P>THE advantages gained by this powerful confederacy between Henry
and Charles, were very incon&s;iderable, during the pre&s;ent year. The
campaign was opened with a victory, gained by the duke of Cleves, Francis's
ally, over the forces of the emperor<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Memoires du
Bellay, lib. X.</NOTE>: Francis, in per&s;on, took the field early; and made
him&s;elf ma&s;ter, without re&s;i&s;tance, of the whole dutchy of Luxembourg:
He afterwards took Landrecy, and added &s;ome fortifications to it. Charles,
having at la&s;t a&s;&s;embled a powerful army, appeared in the Low Countries;
and after taking almo&s;t every fortre&s;s in the dutchy of Cleves, he reduced
the duke to &s;ub|mit to the terms which he was plea&s;ed to pre&s;cribe to
him. Being then joined by a body of &s;ix thou&s;and Engli&s;h, he &s;at down
before Landrecy, and covered the &s;iege with an army of above forty thou&s;and
men. Francis advanced at the head of an army not much inferior; as if he
intended to give the emperor battle, or oblige him to abandon the &s;iege: But
while the&s;e two rival monarchs were facing each other, and all the world
&s;tood in expectation of &s;ome great event; the French found means to throw
&s;uccours into Landrecy, and having thus ef|fected their purpo&s;e, they
&s;kilfully made a retreat. Charles, finding the &s;ea&s;on far advanced,
de&s;paired of &s;ucce&s;s in his enterprize, and found it nece&s;&s;ary to
rai&s;e the &s;iege.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="266"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> THE vanity of
Henry was flattered, by the figure which he made in the great tran&s;actions on
the continent: But the intere&s;ts of his kingdom were much more deeply
concerned in the event of affairs in Scotland. Arran, the governor, was of &s;o
indolent and unambitious a character, that had he not been &s;timulated by his
friends and dependants, he never had a&s;pired to any &s;hare in the
admini&s;tration; and when he found him&s;elf overpowered by the party of the
Queen dowager, the cardinal, and the earl of Lenox, he was glad to accept of
any terms of accom|modation, however di&s;honourable. He even gave them a
&s;ure pledge of his &s;in|cerity, by renouncing the principles of the
reformers, and reconciling him&s;elf to the Romi&s;h communion in the
Franci&s;can church at Stirling. By this weakne&s;s and levity he lo&s;t his
credit with the whole nation, and rendered the prote&s;tants, who were hitherto
the chief &s;upport of his power, his mo&s;t mortal enemies. The cardinal
acquired the entire a&s;cendant in the kingdom: The Queen dowager put implicit
confidence in him: The governor was obliged to yield to him in every
preten&s;ion: Lenox alone was become an ob&s;tacle to his mea&s;ures, and
re|duced him to &s;ome difficulty.</P>
<P>THE inveterate enmity which had taken place between the families
of Lenox and Arran, made the intere&s;ts of the&s;e two noblemen entirely
incompatible; and as the cardinal and the French party, in order to engage
Lenox the more in their cau&s;e, had flattered him with the hopes of
&s;ucceeding to the crown after their infant &s;overeign, this rival&s;hip had
tended &s;till farther to rouze the animo&s;ity of the Hamiltons. Lenox too had
been encouraged to a&s;pire to the marriage of the Queen dowager, which would
have given him &s;ome preten&s;ions to the regency; and as he was become
a&s;&s;uming, on account of the &s;ervices which he had render|ed the party,
the cardinal found, that, &s;ince he mu&s;t choo&s;e between the friend|&s;hip
of Lenox and Arran, the latter nobleman, who was more ea&s;ily governed, and
who was inve&s;ted with pre&s;ent authority, was in every re&s;pect preferable.
In order to remove the former, after the ea&s;ie&s;t and lea&s;t obnoxious
manner, he wrote to Francis, with whom he had entire credit, by means of the
duke of Gui&s;e, father to the Queen dowager; and after prai&s;ing Lenox for
his pa&s;t &s;er|vices, he repre&s;ented the pre&s;ent difficulties and
ob&s;tructions, which he occa&s;ioned in the admini&s;tration, and de&s;ired
that he might be recalled to France, where he enjoyed great credit and large
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. But the impatience of Lenox to at|tain his purpo&s;es,
allowed not this political artifice lei&s;ure to operate. Finding that he was
not likely to &s;ucceed in his preten&s;ions to the Queen dowager, and that
Arran prevailed in every conte&s;t, he retired to Dunbarton, the governor of
which was entirely in his intere&s;ts; he entered into a &s;ecret negociation
with the <PB N="262" REF="267"> Engli&s;h court; and he &s;ummoned his clients
and par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">izans to attend him. All
tho&s;e who were inclined to the prote&s;tant religion, or were on any account
di&s;|contented with the cardinal's admini&s;tration, now regarded Lenox as the
head of their party, and they readily made him a tender of their &s;ervices. In
a little time, he had collected an army of ten thou&s;and men, and he threatned
his ene|mies with immediate de&s;truction. The cardinal had no equal force to
oppo&s;e to him; but as he was a prudent man, he fore&s;aw that Lenox could not
long &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;o great an army, and he endeavoured to protract time, by
opening a negocia|tion with him. He &s;educed his followers, by various
artifices; he engaged the Dougla&s;&s;es in his intere&s;ts; he repre&s;ented
to the whole nation the danger of civil wars and commotions. And Lenox, finding
him&s;elf engaged in an unequal conte&s;t, was at la&s;t obliged to lay down
his arms, and to accept of terms of accom|modation with the governor and the
cardinal. Pre&s;ent peace was re&s;tored; but no confidence took place between
the parties. Lenox, fortifying his ca&s;tles, and putting him&s;elf in a
po&s;ture of defence, waited the &s;uccours of the Engli&s;h, from who&s;e
a&s;&s;i&s;tance alone he expected to obtain the &s;uperiority over his
ene|mies.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1544" UNIT="year"> WHILE the winter &s;ea&s;on
re&s;trained Henry from military operations, he &s;um|moned a new Parliament;
where a law was pa&s;&s;ed, &s;uch as he was plea&s;ed to dictate, with regard
to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown. After declaring, that the prince of
Wales, or any of the King's male i&s;&s;ue, were fir&s;t and immediate heirs to
the kingdom, the Parliament re&s;tored the two prince&s;&s;es, Mary and
Elizabeth, to their right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This &s;eemed a rea&s;onable
piece of ju&s;tice, and corrected what the King's former violence had thrown
into confu&s;ion; but it was impo&s;&s;ible for Henry to do any thing, however
laudable, without betraying, in &s;ome circum|&s;tances, his u&s;ual caprice
and extravagance: Tho' he opened the way for the&s;e two prince&s;&s;es to
mount the throne, he would not allow the act to be rever&s;ed which had
declared them both illegitimate; he made the Parliament con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er on him a power of &s;till excluding
them, if they refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to any conditions which he &s;hould be
plea&s;ed to impo&s;e; and he required them to enact, that, in default of his
own i&s;&s;ue, he might di&s;po&s;e of the crown, as he plea&s;ed, by will or
letters patent. He did not probably fore&s;ee, that in proportion as he
degraded the Parliament, by rendering them the pa&s;&s;ive in&s;trument of his
variable and violent inclinations, he taught the people to regard all their
acts as invalid, and thereby defeated even the purpo&s;es which he was &s;o
bent to attain.</P>
<P>AN act was pa&s;&s;ed, that the King's u&s;ual &s;tile &s;hould
be 
<Q REND="inline">"King of England, France, and Ireland, defender
of the faith, and on earth the &s;upreme head <PB N="263" REF="268"> of the
church of England and Ireland."</Q> It &s;eemed a palpable incon&s;i&s;tency,
to retain the title of defender of the faith, which the &s;ee of Rome had
conferred on him for maintaining its cau&s;e again&s;t Luther; and yet
&s;ubjoin his eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;upremacy, in oppo&s;ition to the claims of
that &s;ee.</P>
<P>AN act was al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed, for the remi&s;&s;ion of a loan of
money, which the King had lately rai&s;ed. It will ea&s;ily be believed, that,
after the former act of this kind, the loan was not entirely voluntary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">35 Hen. VIII. c. 12.</NOTE>. But there was a peculiar
circum|&s;tance attending the pre&s;ent &s;tatute, which none but Henry would
have thought of: That tho&s;e who had already got payment, either in whole or
in part, &s;hould re|fund the &s;ums to the exchequer.</P>
<P>THE oaths which Henry e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;ecurity of his
eccle&s;ia&s;tical model, were not more rea&s;onable than his other mea&s;ures.
All his &s;ubjects of any di&s;|tinction had already been obliged to renounce
the pope's &s;upremacy; but as the clau&s;es which they &s;wore to, had not
been e&s;teemed entirely &s;atisfactory, another oath was impo&s;ed, and it was
added, that all tho&s;e who had taken the former oaths, &s;hould be
under&s;tood to have taken the new one<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">35 Hen.
VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>. A &s;trange &s;uppo&s;i|tion! to repre&s;ent men as bound
by an oath which they had never con&s;ented to take.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t commendable act to which the Parliament gave their
&s;anction, was that by which they mitigated the law of the &s;ix articles, and
ordained, that no per&s;on &s;hould be put to his trial upon any accu&s;ation
concerning any of the of|fences comprized in that &s;anguinary &s;tatute,
except on the oath of twelve per|&s;ons before commi&s;&s;ioners authorized for
that purpo&s;e; and that no per&s;on &s;hould be arre&s;ted or committed to
ward for any &s;uch offence before he was indicted. Any preacher, accu&s;ed of
&s;peaking in his &s;ermon contrary to the&s;e articles, mu&s;t be indicted
within forty days.</P>
<P>THE King always experienced the limits of his exorbitant
authority whenever he demanded &s;ub&s;idies, however moderate, from the
Parliament; and, therefore, not to hazard a refu&s;al, he made no mention this
&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;upply: But as his wars both with France and Scotland, as
well as his u&s;ual prodigality, had involv|ed him in great expence, he had
recour&s;e to other methods of filling his trea&s;ury: Notwith&s;tanding the
former abolition of his debts, he yet required new loans from his &s;ubjects:
And he enhanced gold from forty-five &s;hillings to forty-eight an ounce; and
&s;ilver from three &s;hillings and nine pence to four &s;hillings. His
pretence for this innovation, was to prevent the money from being exported; as
if that expedient could any way &s;erve the purpo&s;e. He even coined &s;ome
ba&s;e <PB N="264" REF="269"> money, and ordered it to be current by his
proclamation. He named commi&s;|&s;ioners for levying a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nevolence, and he extorted about &s;eventy thou&s;and
pounds by that expedient. Read, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">derman of London<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Stowe, p.

The&s;e powers of the prerogative, (which at that time pa&s;&s;ed for
unque&s;|tioned) of the King's compelling any man to &s;erve in any office, and
of impri|&s;oning any man during plea&s;ure, not to mention the practice of
extorting loans, rendered the &s;overeign, in a manner, ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of
the per&s;on and property of every individual.</P>
<P>EARLY this year the King &s;ent a fleet and army to invade
Scotland. The fleet con&s;i&s;ted of near two hundred ve&s;&s;els, and carried
on board ten thou&s;and men. Dudley lord Li&s;le commanded the &s;ea forces;
the earl of Hertford the land. The troops were di&s;embarked near Leith; and
after di&s;&s;ipating a &s;mall body which oppo&s;ed them, they took that town
without re&s;i&s;tance, and then marched to Edinburgh. The gates were &s;oon
beat down (for little or no re&s;i&s;tance was made); and the Engli&s;h fir&s;t
pillaged, and then &s;et fire to the city. The regent and cardinal were not
prepared to oppo&s;e &s;o great a force, and they fled to Stirling. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th May.</NOTE> Hertford marched ea&s;tward;
and being joined by a new body under Evers, warden of the ea&s;t marches, he
laid wa&s;te the whole country, burned and de&s;troyed Hadington and Dunbar,
and then retired into England; having lo&s;t only forty men in the whole
expedition. The earl of Arran collected &s;ome forces; but finding that the
Engli&s;h were already departed, he turned them again&s;t Lenox, who was
ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected of a corre&s;pondence with the enemy. That nobleman,
after making &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, was obliged to fly into England; where
Henry &s;ettled a pen&s;ion on him, and even gave him his niece, the lady
Margaret Douglas, in marriage. In return, Lenox &s;tipulated conditions, by

invade France with forces amount|ing to above a hundred thou&s;and men: Henry
engaged to &s;et out from Calais; Charles from the Low Countries: They were to
enter on no &s;iege, but leaving all the frontier towns behind them, to march
directly to Paris, where they were to join their forces, and thence to proceed
to the entire conque&s;t of the kingdom. Francis could not oppo&s;e to the&s;e

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14th July. Campaign in France.</NOTE> HENRY,

Paulet lord St. John, lord Ferrers of Chartley, lord Mountjoy, lord Grey of

to the &s;ide of Champagne, in order to oppo&s;e the imperiali&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE emperor, with an army of near &s;ixty thou&s;and men, had
taken the field much earlier than Henry; and not to lo&s;e time, while he
waited for the march of his confederate, he &s;at down before Luxembourg, which
he took: He thence proceeded to Commercy on the Meu&s;e, which was
&s;urrendered to him: Ligny met with the &s;ame fate: He next laid &s;iege to
St. Di&s;ier on the Marne, which, tho' a weak place, made a brave

had fir&s;t broke engage|ments by forming &s;ieges, or, perhaps, fore&s;eeing
the dangerous con&s;equences of de&s;troying entirely the French power,
in&s;tead of marching forward to Paris, &s;at down before Montreuil and
Boulog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e. The duke of Norfolk
commanded the army before Montreuil: The King him&s;elf that before Boulogne.
Vervin was governor of Boulogne, and under him Philip Cor&s;e, a brave old
&s;oldier, who encouraged the garri&s;on to defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t
extremity again&s;t the Engli&s;h.

di&s;honourable capitulation.</P>
<P>DURING the cour&s;e of this &s;iege, Charles had taken St.
Di&s;ier; and finding the &s;ea&s;on much advanced, he began to hearken to a
treaty of peace with France, &s;ince all his &s;chemes for &s;ubduing that
kingdom were likely to prove abortive. In order to have a pretence for
de&s;erting his ally, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to the Eng|li&s;h camp,
requiring Henry immediately to fulfil his engagements, and to meet him with his
army before Paris. Henry replied, that he was too far engaged in the &s;iege of
Boulogne to rai&s;e it with honour, and that the emperor him&s;elf had fir&s;t
broke the concert by forming &s;ieges. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th Septem|ber.</NOTE> This an&s;wer &s;erved
Charles as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for concluding a peace with Francis at
Crepy, where no mention was made of the Engli&s;h. He &s;tipulated to give
Flanders as a dowry to his daugh|ter, whom he agreed to marry to the duke of
Orleans, Francis's &s;econd &s;on; and Francis, in return, withdrew his troops
from Piemont and Savoy, and re|nounced all claim to Milan, Naples, and other
territories in Italy. This peace, &s;o advantageous to Francis, was procured
partly by the deci&s;ive victory obtained in the beginning of the campaign by
the count of Anguyen over the imperiali&s;ts at Ceri&s;olles in Piemont, partly
by the emperor's great de&s;ire to turn his arms again&s;t the prote&s;tant
princes in Germany. Charles ordered his troops to &s;epa|rate from the
Engli&s;h in Picardy; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th Septem|ber.</NOTE> and Henry, finding
him&s;elf obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Montreuil, returned into England.
This campaign &s;erved, to the populace, as matter of great triumph; but all
men of &s;en&s;e concluded, that the King had, as in all his former military
enterprizes, made, at an infinite charge, an acqui&s;ition which was of no
manner of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>THE war with Scotland, meanwhile, was conducted feebly, and with
various &s;ucce&s;s. Sir Ralph Evers, now lord Evers, and Sir Bryan Latoun,
made an in|road into that kingdom; and having laid wa&s;te the counties of
Tiviotdale and the Mer&s;e, they proceeded to the abbey of Coldingham, which
they took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and fortified. The regent a&s;&s;embled an
army of eight thou&s;and men, in order to di&s;lodge them from this po&s;t; but
he had no &s;ooner opened his bat|teries before the place, than a &s;udden
panic &s;eized him, and he fled to Dunbar. He complained of the mutinies of his
army, and pretended to be afraid le&s;t they &s;hould deliver him into the
hands of the Engli&s;h: But his own unwarlike &s;pirit was generally believed
to have been the motive of this di&s;honourable re|treat. The Scotch army, upon
the departure of their general, immediately fell into confu&s;ion; and had not
Angus, with a few of his retainers, brought off the cannon, and protected their
rear, the Engli&s;h might have gained great ad|vantages over them. Evers,
elated with this &s;ucce&s;s, boa&s;ted to Henry, that he <PB N="267" REF="272"> had conquered all Scotland to the Forth; and he claimed a reward for
this im|portant &s;ervice. The duke of Norfolk, who knew with what difficulty
&s;uch acqui&s;itions would be maintained again&s;t a warlike people, advi&s;ed
the King to grant him, as his reward, the conque&s;ts of which he &s;o highly
boa&s;ted. <MILESTONE N="1545" UNIT="year"> The next inroad made by the
Engli&s;h, &s;hewed the vanity of Evers's hopes. This gene|ral led about five
thou&s;and men into Tiviotdale, and was employed in ravaging that country; when
intelligence was brought him, that &s;ome Scotch forces ap|peared near the
abbey of Melro&s;s. Angus had excited the regent to more acti|vity; and a
proclamation being i&s;&s;ued for a&s;&s;embling the troops of the neighbouring
counties, a con&s;iderable body had repaired to his &s;tandard. Norman Le&s;ly,
&s;on to the Earl of Rothes, had al&s;o joined the army with &s;ome volunteers
from Fife; and he in&s;pired courage into the whole, as well by this
acce&s;&s;ion of force, as by his per&s;onal bravery and intrepidity. In order
to bring their troops to the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;teddy defence, the Scotch
leaders ordered all their cavalry to di&s;mount; and they re&s;olved to wait,
on &s;ome high grounds at Ancram, the a&s;|&s;ault of the Engli&s;h. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of Fe|bruary.</NOTE> The Engli&s;h,
who&s;e pa&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es had taught them too much to de&s;pi&s;e the
enemy, thought, when they &s;aw the Scotch hor&s;es led off the field, that the
whole army was retiring; and they ha&s;tened to attack them. The Scotch
received them in good order; and being favoured by the advantage of the ground,
as well as by the &s;urprize of the Engli&s;h, who expected no re|&s;i&s;tance,
they &s;oon put them to flight, and pur&s;ued them with a con&s;iderable
flaughter. Evers and Latoun were both killed, and above a thou&s;and men were
made pri&s;oners. In order to &s;upport the Scotch in this war, Francis, &s;ome
time after, &s;ent over a body of auxiliaries, to the number of three
thou&s;and five hun|dred men, under the command of Montgomery, lord of
Lorges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. XV. Drummond.</NOTE>. Reinforced
by the&s;e &s;uccours, the regent a&s;&s;embled an army of fifteen thou&s;and
men at Had|ington, and marched thence to ravage the ea&s;t borders of England.
They laid all wa&s;te wherever they came; and having met with no con&s;iderable
re&s;i&s;tance, they retired into their own country, and di&s;per&s;ed
them&s;elves. The earl of Hertford, in revenge, committed ravages on the middle
and we&s;t marches; and the war on both &s;ides was &s;ignalized rather by the
ills inflicted on the enemy, than by any con&s;iderable advantage gained by
either party.</P>
<P>THE war likewi&s;e between France and England was not
di&s;tingui&s;hed this year by any memorable events. Francis had equipped a
fleet of above two hundred fail, be|&s;ides gallies; and having embarked &s;ome
land forces on board, he &s;ent them to make a de&s;cent in England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Beleair. Memoires du Bellay.</NOTE>. They failed to
the I&s;le of Wight, where they found the <PB N="268" REF="273"> Engli&s;h
fleet lying at anchor in St. Helens. It con&s;i&s;ted not of above an hundred
fail; and the admiral thought it mo&s;t advi&s;eable to remain in that road, in
hopes of drawing the French into the narrow pa&s;&s;ages and rocks, which were
unknown to them. The two fleets cannonaded one another for two days; and except
the &s;inking of the Mary Ro&s;e, one of the large&s;t &s;hips of the
Eng|li&s;h fleet, the damage on both &s;ides was incon&s;iderable. The French
landed troops in the I&s;le of Wight, and committed ravages; but being
repul&s;ed by the militia of the country, they retired to their &s;hips, which
&s;oon after &s;et &s;ail for France. They were again driven by the wind on the
coa&s;t of England, where they met with the Engli&s;h fleet; and a new
cannonading en&s;ued, which proved no more deci&s;ive than the foregoing. It
was indeed &s;carce po&s;&s;ible, that a fleet at that time could, without
boarding, gain any con&s;iderable advantage over the enemy. The cannon were
commonly &s;o ill &s;erved, that a French writer of me|moirs<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De Langey.</NOTE>ob&s;erves, as a circum&s;tance &s;ome what
&s;ingular, that each of the&s;e nume|rous fleets in a two hours engagement,
fired full three hundred &s;hot. One large &s;hip in our time could, without
difficulty, do as much.</P>
<P>FRANCIS'S chief intention, in equipping &s;o great a fleet, was
to prevent the Engli&s;h from throwing &s;uccours into Boulogne, which he
intended to be&s;iege; and for that purpo&s;e, he ordered a fort to be built,
by which he propo&s;ed to block up the harbour. After a con&s;iderable lo&s;s
of money and time, the fort was found &s;o ill con&s;tructed, that he was
obliged to abandon it; and tho' he had brought together, on that frontier, an
army of near forty thou&s;and men, he was not able to effect any con&s;iderable
enterprize. He broke into the territory of Oye, an extent of country which lies
near Calais, and which &s;erved commonly to &s;upply the garri&s;on with
provi&s;ions; and he laid it entirely wa&s;te by fire and &s;word. Several
&s;kirmi&s;hes en&s;ued between the French and Engli&s;h, in one of which the
duke of Aumale received a remarkable wound. A lance was run into his head
between his eye and no&s;e; and notwith&s;tanding that the lance broke and the
head of it remained in the wound, he was not di&s;mounted by &s;o violent a
&s;hock, and the head of the lance being extracted by a &s;kilful &s;urgeon, he
afterwards recovered, and rendered him&s;elf extremely famous by the name of
the duke of Gui&s;e. Henry, in order to defend his dominions in France, had
levied fourteen thou&s;and Germans; who, having marched to Fleurines in the
bi&s;hopric of Liege, found they could advance no farther. The Emperor would
not allow them a pa&s;&s;age through his dominions: They received intelligence
of a &s;uperior army on the &s;ide of France ready to intercept them:
Idlene&s;s and want of pay &s;oon bred a mutiny among them: And having &s;eized
the Engli&s;h <PB N="269" REF="274"> commi&s;&s;aries as a &s;ecurity for
arrears, they retreated into their own country. There &s;eems to have been
&s;ome want of fore&s;ight and contrivance in this expen|&s;ive armament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">23 November.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> THE great expence of
the&s;e two wars, maintained by Henry, obliged him to &s;um|mon a new
Parliament. The commons granted him a &s;ub&s;idy, payable in two years, of two
&s;hillings a pound on land<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed goods or money, above five pound and below ten, were to pay

apprehen&s;ive le&s;t more demands &s;hould be made upon them, thought to
&s;ave them&s;elves by a very extraordinary libe|rality of other people's
property; and by one vote they be&s;towed on the King the whole revenues of the
univer&s;ities, as well as of the chauntries, free chappels<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">A chauntry was a little church, chappel, or particular altar in

Henry was plea&s;ed with this conce&s;&s;ion, as it encrea&s;ed his power; but
he had no intention of de&s;poiling learning of all her endowments; and he
&s;oon took care to inform the univer&s;ities, that he meant not to touch their
re|venues. Thus the&s;e antient and celebrated e&s;tabli&s;hments owed their
&s;ub&s;i&s;tance to the genero&s;ity of the King, not to the protection of
this &s;ervile and pro&s;titute Parliament.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">24 December.</NOTE> THE King made in per&s;on
a &s;peech to the Parliament on proroguing them; where, after thanking them for
their loving attachment to him, which, he &s;aid, equalled what was ever paid
by their ance&s;tors to any King of England, he com|plained of their
di&s;&s;en&s;ions, di&s;putes and animo&s;ities in religion. He told them, 
<PB N="270" REF="275"> that the &s;everal pulpits were become a kind of
batteries again&s;t each other; and that one preacher called another heretic
and anabapti&s;t, which was retaliated by the op|probious terms of papi&s;t and
hypocrite: That he had permitted his people the u&s;e of the &s;criptures, not
in order to furni&s;h them materials for di&s;pute and railing, but that he
might enable them to inform their con&s;ciences and in&s;truct their children
and families: That it grieved his heart to find how that precious jewel was
pro|&s;tituted, by being introduced into the conver&s;ation of every alehou&s;e
and tavern, and employed as a pretence for decrying the &s;piritual and legal
pa&s;tors: And that he was &s;orry to ob&s;erve, that the word of God, while it
was the object of &s;o much anxious &s;peculation, had very little influence on
their practice; and that tho' an imaginary knowlege &s;o much abounded, charity
was daily going to decay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol 261. Herbert, p.

&s;peculation and di&s;pute, was ill qualified to promote that peaceable
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of opinion, which he recommended.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1546" UNIT="year"> HENRY employed in military
preparations the money granted by Parliament; and he &s;ent over the earl of
Hertford, and lord Li&s;le the admiral, to Calais with a body of nine
thou&s;and men, two thirds of which con&s;i&s;ted of foreigners. Some
&s;kirmi&s;hes en&s;ued of &s;mall con&s;equence; and no hopes of any
con&s;iderable pro|gre&s;s could be entertained by either &s;ide. Henry,
who&s;e animo&s;ity again&s;t Francis was not violent, had given &s;ufficient
vent to his humour by this &s;hort war; and finding, that from his great
encrea&s;e in corpulence and decay in &s;trength, he could not hope for much
longer life, he was de&s;irous of ending a quarrel, which might prove dangerous
to his kingdom during a minority. Francis likewi&s;e, on his part, was not
aver&s;e to peace with England; becau&s;e, having lately lo&s;t his &s;on, the
duke of Orleans, he revived his antient claim upon Milan, and fore&s;aw, that
ho&s;tilities mu&s;t &s;oon, on that account, break out between him and the
Em|peror. Commi&s;&s;ioners therefore having met at Campe, a place between
Ardres and Gui&s;nes, the articles were &s;oon agreed, and the peace &s;igned
by them. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of June. Peace with France and

This debt was &s;ettled at two millions of livres, be&s;ides a claim of 500,000
livres, which was afterwards to be adju&s;ted. Francis took care to comprehend
Scotland in the treaty. Thus all that Henry obtained by a war, which co&s;t him
above one million three hun|dred and forty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Stowe.</NOTE>, was a bad &s;ecurity for a

<P><PB N="271" REF="276"> THE King, being now freed from all
foreign wars, had lei&s;ure to give his at|tention to dome&s;tic affairs; and
particularly to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of uniformity of opinion, on which he was
&s;o intent. Tho' he allowed an Engli&s;h tran&s;lation of the Bible, he had
hitherto been very careful to keep the ma&s;s in Latin; but he was at la&s;t
prevailed with to permit, that the Litany, a con&s;iderable part of the public
wor|&s;hip, &s;hould be celebrated in the vulgar tongue; and by this
innovation, he excited anew the hopes of the reformers, who had been &s;omewhat
di&s;couraged by the &s;e|verity of the &s;tatute of the &s;ix articles. One
petition of the new Litany was a prayer to &s;ave us <HI>from the tyranny of
the bi&s;hop of Rome, and from all his dete&s;table en|ormities.</HI> Cranmer
was employing his authority to engage Henry to farther inno|vations, and he
took advantage of Gardiner's ab&s;ence, who was employed in an emba&s;&s;y to
the emperor; but Gardiner, having wrote to the King, that, if he carried his
oppo&s;ition again&s;t the catholic religion to greater extremities, Charles
threatened to break off all commerce with him, the &s;ucce&s;s of Cranmer's
projects was for the time retarded. Cranmer lo&s;t this year the mo&s;t
&s;incere and mo&s;t powerful friend, whom he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at court;
Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk: The Queen dowager of France, &s;pou&s;e to
Suffolk, had died &s;ome years before. This nobleman is one in&s;tance, that
Henry was not altogether incapable of a cordial and &s;teady friend&s;hip; and
Suffolk &s;eems to have been entirely worthy of that favour, which, from his
earlie&s;t youth, he had enjoyed with him. The King was &s;itting in council
when informed of Suffolk's death; and he took that occa&s;ion both to expre&s;s
his own &s;orrow for the lo&s;s, and to celebrate the merits of the decea&s;ed.
He de|clared, that, during the whole cour&s;e of their corre&s;pondence, he had
not made any attempt to injure an adver&s;ary, and had never whi&s;pered a word
to the di&s;|advantage of any one.

<P>CRANMER him&s;elf, when bereaved of this &s;upport, was the more
expo&s;ed to tho&s;e cabals of the courtiers, which the oppo&s;ition of party
and religion, joined to the u&s;ual motives of intere&s;t, rendered &s;o eager
among Henry's mini&s;ters and coun&s;ellors. The catholics took advantage of
the King's pa&s;&s;ion for orthodoxy; and they repre&s;ented to him, that, if
his laudable zeal for inforcing the truth met with no greater &s;ucce&s;s, it
was owing altogether to the primate, who&s;e example and encouragement were, in
reality, the &s;ecret &s;upports of here&s;y. Henry, &s;ee|ing the point to
which they tended, feigned a compliance, and de&s;ired the coun|cil to make
enquiry into Cranmer's conduct; promi&s;ing that, if he was found guilty, he
&s;hould &s;end him to the Tower, and bring him to condign puni&s;hment. 
<PB N="272" REF="277"> All the world now gave the primate for lo&s;t; and his
old friends, from merce|nary views, as well as the oppo&s;ite party, from
animo&s;ity, began to &s;how him marks of neglect and di&s;regard. He was
obliged to &s;tand &s;everal hours among the lacqueys at the door of the
council-chamber, before he could be admitted; and when he was at la&s;t called
in, he was told, that they had determined to &s;end him to the Tower. Cranmer
&s;aid, that he appealed to the King him&s;elf; and finding his appeal
di&s;regarded, he produced a ring, which Henry had given him as a pledge of
favour and protection. The council were confounded; and when they came before
the King, he reproved them in the &s;evere&s;t terms, and told them, that he
was well acquainted with Cranmer's merit, as well as with their malignity and
envy: But he was determined to cru&s;h all their cabals, and to teach them, by
the &s;evere&s;t di&s;cipline, &s;ince gentle methods were vain, a more dutiful
concurrence in promoting his &s;ervice. Norfolk, who was Cranmer's capi|tal
enemy, apologized for their conduct, by &s;aying, that their only intention was
to &s;et the primate's innocence in a full light by bringing him to an open
trial: And Henry obliged them all to embrace him, as a &s;ign of their cordial
reconcile|ment. The mild temper of Cranmer rendered this reconcilement more

delicate article; and Henry, in&s;tead of having indulgence to the weakne&s;s
of her &s;ex and age, was but the more provoked, that a woman &s;hould dare to
oppo&s;e his theological &s;entiments. She was prevailed on by Bonner's
me|naces to make a &s;eeming recantation; but &s;he qualified it with &s;ome
re&s;erves, which did not &s;atisfy that zealous prelate. She was thrown into
pri&s;on, and there employed her&s;elf in compo&s;ing prayers and
di&s;cour&s;es, by which &s;he forti|fied her re&s;olution to endure the
utmo&s;t extremity rather than relinqui&s;h her reli|gious principles. She even
wrote to the King, and told him, that as to the Lord's Supper, &s;he believed
as much as Chri&s;t him&s;elf had &s;aid of it, and as much of his divine
doctrine as the catholic church had required: But while &s;he could not be
brought to acknowlege an a&s;&s;ent to the King's explications, this
declaration availed her nothing, and was rather regarded as a fre&s;h in&s;ult.
The chancellor, Wriothe&s;ely, who had &s;ucceeded Audley, and who was much

con&s;tancy &s;till &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the barbarity of her per&s;ecutors, and
they found all their efforts to be baffled. She was then condemned to be burned
alive; and being &s;o di&s;located by the rack, that &s;he could not &s;tand,
&s;he was carried to the &s;take in a chair. Together with her, were brought
Nicholas Belenian, a prie&s;t, John La&s;&s;els of the King's family, and John
Adams a taylor, who had been condemned for the &s;ame crime to the &s;ame
puni&s;hment. They were all tied to the &s;take; and in that dreadful
&s;ituation, the chancellor &s;ent to inform them, that their pardon was ready
drawn and &s;igned, and &s;hould in&s;tantly be given them, if they would merit
it by a recantation. They only regarded this offer as a new ornament to their
crown of martyrdom; and they &s;aw with tranquillity the executioner kindle the
flames which con&s;umed them. Wriothe&s;ely did not con&s;ider, that this
public and noted &s;ituation intere&s;ted their honour the more to maintain a
&s;teady per&s;everance.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the &s;ecrecy and fidelity of Anne A&s;cue &s;aved the
Queen from this peril, &s;he &s;oon after fell into a new danger, from which
&s;he very narrowly e&s;caped. There was an ulcer broke out in the King's leg,
which, joined to his extreme corpulency and his bad habit of body, began both
to threaten his life, and to render him, even more than u&s;ual, peevi&s;h and
pa&s;&s;ionate. The Queen, during this time, attended him with the mo&s;t
tender and dutiful care, and endeavoured, by every &s;oothing art and
compliance, to allay tho&s;e gu&s;ts of humour, to which he was become &s;o
&s;ubject. His favourite topic of conver&s;ation was theology; and Catherine,
who&s;e good &s;en&s;e made her capable of di&s;cour&s;ing on any &s;ubject,
was frequently engaged into the argu|ment; and being &s;ecretly inclined to the
principles of the reformers, &s;he un|warily di&s;covered too much of her mind
on the&s;e occa&s;ions. Henry, highly pro|voked <PB N="274" REF="279"> that
&s;he &s;hould pre&s;ume to differ from him, made complaints of her
ob|&s;tinacy to Gardiner, who gladly laid hold of the opportunity to inflame
the quar|rel. He prai&s;ed the King's anxious care of pre&s;erving the
orthodoxy of his &s;ub|jects; and repre&s;ented, that the more elevated the
per&s;on was who was cha&s;ti&s;ed, and the more near to his per&s;on, the
greater terror would the example &s;trike into every one, and the more glorious
would the &s;acrifice appear to all po&s;terity. The chancellor, being
con&s;ulted, was engaged by religious zeal to &s;econd the&s;e to|pics; and
Henry, hurried by his own impetuous temper, and encouraged by his
coun&s;ellors, went &s;o far as to order articles of impeachment to be drawn up
again&s;t his con&s;ort. Wriothe&s;ely executed his commands; and &s;oon after
brought the paper to him to be &s;igned: For as it was high trea&s;on to throw
&s;lander upon the Queen, he might otherwi&s;e have been que&s;tioned for his
temerity. In going home, he chanced to drop this important paper from his
pocket; and as &s;ome per&s;on of the Queen's party found it, it was
immediately carried to her. She was &s;en&s;ible of the extreme danger to which
&s;he was expo&s;ed; but did not de|&s;pair of being able, by her prudence and
addre&s;s, &s;till to elude the efforts of her enemies. She paid her u&s;ual
vi&s;it to the King, and found him in a more &s;erene di&s;po&s;ition than
&s;he had rea&s;on to expect. He entered on the &s;ubject which was &s;o
familiar to him, and he &s;eemed to challenge her to an argument in divinity.
She gently declined the conver&s;ation, and ob&s;erved, that &s;uch profound
&s;pecula|tions were ill &s;uited to the natural imbecillity of her &s;ex.
Women, &s;he &s;aid, by their fir&s;t creation, were made &s;ubject to men: The
male was created after the image of God; the female after the image of the
male: It belonged to the hu&s;|band to choo&s;e principles for his wife; the
wife's duty was, in all ca&s;es, to adopt implicitely the &s;entiments of her
hu&s;band: And as to her&s;elf, it was doubly her duty, being ble&s;t with a
hu&s;band, who was qualified, by his judgment and learn|ing, not only to
choo&s;e principles for his own family, but for the mo&s;t wi&s;e and knowing
of every nation. 
<Q REND="inline">"Not &s;o! by St. Mary," replied the King, "you
are now become a doctor, Kate; and better fitted to give than receive
in|&s;tructions."</Q> She meekly replied, that &s;he was &s;en&s;ible how
little &s;he was in|titled to the&s;e prai&s;es; that tho' &s;he u&s;ually
declined not any conver&s;ation, how|ever &s;ublime, when propo&s;ed by his
maje&s;ty, &s;he well knew, that her concep|tions could &s;erve to no other
purpo&s;e than to give him a little momentary amu&s;e|ment; that &s;he found
the conver&s;ation apt to langui&s;h when not revived by &s;ome oppo&s;ition,
and had ventured &s;ometimes to feign a contrariety of &s;entiments, in order
to give him the plea&s;ure of refuting her; and that &s;he al&s;o propo&s;ed,
by this innocent artifice, to engage him into topics, whence, &s;he had
ob&s;erved, by her frequent experience, that &s;he reaped profit and
in&s;truction. 
<Q REND="inline">"And is it &s;o, <PB N="275" REF="280">
&s;weet-heart?" replied the King, "then are we perfect friends again."</Q> He
embraced her with great affection, and &s;ent her away with a&s;&s;urances of
his pro|tection and kindne&s;s. Her enemies, who knew nothing of this turn,
pre|pared next day to convey her to the Tower, pur&s;uant to the King's
warrant. Henry and Catherine were conver&s;ing amicably in the garden, when the
chancel|lor appeared with forty of the pur&s;uivants. The King &s;poke to him
at &s;ome di&s;|tance from her; and &s;eemed to expo&s;tulate with him in the
&s;evere&s;t manner: She even overheard the terms of <HI>knave, fool,</HI> and
<HI>bea&s;t,</HI> which he very liberally be&s;towed upon that magi&s;trate;
and then ordered him to depart his pre&s;ence. She afterwards interpo&s;ed to
mitigate his anger: He &s;aid to her, 
<Q REND="inline">"Poor &s;oul! you know not how little intitled
this man is to your good offices."</Q> From thenceforth, the Queen, having
narrowly e&s;caped &s;o great a danger, was careful not to offend Henry's
humour by any contradiction; and Gardiner, who&s;e ma|lice had endeavoured to
widen the breach, could never afterwards recover his fa|vour and good
opinion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 344. Herbert, p. 560. Speed,

<P>BUT Henry's tyrannical di&s;po&s;ition, &s;oured by ill health,
bur&s;t out &s;oon after to the de&s;truction of a man, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a
much &s;uperior rank to Gardi|ner. The duke of Norfolk and his father, during
this whole reign, and even a great part of the foregoing, had been regarded as
the greate&s;t &s;ubjects in the king|dom, and had rendered very con&s;iderable
&s;ervices to the crown. The duke him&s;elf had in his youth di&s;tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf by naval enterprizes: He had much contri|buted to the victory over
the Scotch at Flouden: He had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a dangerous rebellion in the
North: And he had always done his part with honour in all the expeditions
again&s;t France. Fortune &s;eemed to con&s;pire with his own indu&s;try, in
rai&s;ing him to the highe&s;t elevation. By the favours heaped on him from the
crown, he had acquired an immen&s;e e&s;tate: The King had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively
been mar|ried to two of his nieces; and the King's &s;on, the duke of Richmond,
had mar|ried his daughter: Be&s;ides his de&s;cent from the antient family of
the Moubrays, by which he was allied to the throne, he had e&s;pou&s;ed a
daughter of the duke of Buckingham, who was de&s;cended by a female from Edward
the third: And as he was believed &s;till to adhere &s;ecretly to the antient
religion, he was regarded, abroad and at home, as the head of the catholic
party. But all the&s;e circum|&s;tances, in proportion as they exalted the
duke, provoked the jealou&s;y of Henry; and he &s;ore&s;aw danger, during his
&s;on's minority, both to the public tranquil|lity, and to the new
eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;y&s;tem, from the attempts of &s;o potent a &s;ub|ject.
But nothing tended more to expo&s;e Norfolk to the King's vengeance, 
<PB N="276" REF="281"> than the prejudices, which Henry had entertained
again&s;t the earl of Surrey, &s;on to that nobleman.</P>
<P>SURREY was a young man of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing hopes, and had
di&s;tingui&s;h|ed him&s;elf by every accompli&s;hment, which became a
&s;cholar, a courtier, and a &s;oldier. He excelled in all the military
exerci&s;es, which were then in reque&s;t: He encouraged the fine arts by his
patronage and example: He had made &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful attempts in poetry;
and being &s;mit with the romantic gallantry of that age, he celebrated his
mi&s;tre&s;s's prai&s;e by his pen and his lance, in every ma&s;que and
tournament. His &s;pirit and ambition were equal to his talents and his
quality; and he did not always regulate his conduct by that caution and
re&s;erve, which his &s;ituation required. He had been left governor of
Boulogne, when that town was taken by Henry; but tho' his per&s;onal bravery
was unque&s;tioned, he had been unfortunate in &s;ome rencounters with the
French. The King, &s;ome|what di&s;plea&s;ed with his conduct, had &s;ent over
Hertford to command in his place; and Surrey was &s;o imprudent as to drop
&s;ome menacing expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the mini&s;ters, on account of this
affront, which was put upon him. And as he had refu&s;ed to marry Hertford's
daughter, and even waved every pro|po&s;al of marriage, which were made him;
Henry imagined, that he had enter|tained views of e&s;pou&s;ing the lady Mary;
and he was in&s;tantly determined to re|pre&s;s, by the mo&s;t &s;evere
expedients, &s;o dangerous an ambition.</P>
<P>ACTUATED by all the&s;e motives, and perhaps too influenced by
that old di&s;gu&s;t, with which the ill conduct of Catherine Howard had
in&s;pired him again&s;t all her family, he gave private orders to arre&s;t
Norfolk and Surrey; and they were on the &s;ame day confined to the Tower.

His <PB N="277" REF="282"> dutche&s;s, with whom he lived on bad terms, had
been &s;o ba&s;e as to carry intel|ligence to his enemies of all &s;he knew

&s;ub&s;ervient to the de&s;igns of the court: Yet with all the&s;e advantages
his accu&s;ers di&s;covered no greater crime, than that he had once &s;aid,
that the King was &s;ickly, and could not hold out long, and the king|dom was
likely to fall into di&s;orders, thro' the diver&s;ity of religious opinions.
He wrote a m &s;t pathetic letter to the King, pleading his pa&s;t &s;ervices,
and pro|te&s;ting his innocence: Soon after he embraced a more proper expedient
for ap|pea&s;ing Henry, by making a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and confe&s;&s;ion, &s;uch
as his enemies re|quired: But nothing could mollify the unrelenting temper of
the King. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th January.</NOTE> He a&s;&s;embled the

trial or evidence, pa&s;&s;ed a bill of attainder again&s;t him, and &s;ent it
down to the com|mons. Cranmer, tho' engaged for many years in an oppo&s;ite
party to Norfolk, and tho' he had received many and great injuries from him,
would have no hand in &s;o unju&s;t a pro&s;ecution, and retired to his &s;eat
at Croydon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 348. Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. The King was now approaching
fa&s;t towards his end; and&punc; fearing le&s;t Norfolk &s;hould e&s;cape him,
he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the commons, by which he de&s;ired them to ha&s;ten
the bill, under pretence, that Norfolk enjoyed the dignity of earl mar&s;hal,
and it was nece&s;&s;ary to appoint another, who might officiate at the
en&s;uing ceremony of in&s;talling his &s;on, prince of Wales. The ob&s;equious
commons obeyed his di|rections, tho' founded on &s;o frivolous a pretence; and
the King, having affixed the royal a&s;&s;ent to the bill by commi&s;&s;ioners,
i&s;&s;ued orders for the execution of Norfolk on the morning of the twenty
ninth of January. But news being car|ried to the Tower, that the King him&s;elf
had expired that night, the lieutenant deferred the execution of the warrant,
and it was not thought advi&s;able by the council, to begin a new reign by the
death of the greate&s;t nobleman in the king|dom, who had been condemned by a
&s;entence &s;o unju&s;t and tyrannical.</P>
<P>THE King's health had been long in a very declining condition;
but for &s;everal days all tho&s;e near him plainly &s;aw his death
approaching. He was become &s;o froward, that no one dur&s;t inform him of his
condition; and as &s;ome per&s;ons, during this reign, had been puni&s;hed as
traitors for foretelling the King's death<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lanquet's Epitome of chronicles in the year 1541.</NOTE>, every
one was afraid, left, in the tran&s;ports of his fury, he might, on this
pre|tence, inflict puni&s;hment on the author of &s;uch friendly intelligence.
At la&s;t, Sir Anthony Denny ventured to di&s;clo&s;e to him the fatal
&s;ecret, and exhorted him to prepare for the fate which was awaiting him. He
expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;igna|tion; <PB N="278" REF="283"> and de&s;ired that
Cranmer might be &s;ent for: But before that prelate ar|rived, he was
&s;peechle&s;s, tho' he &s;till &s;eemed to retain his &s;en&s;es. Cranmer
de|&s;ired him to give &s;ome &s;ign of his dying in the faith of Chri&s;t: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the King.</NOTE> He &s;queezed his
hand, and immediately expired, after a reign of&punc; thirty-&s;even years and
nine months; and in the fifty-&s;ixth year of his age.</P>
<P>THE King had made his will near a month before his decea&s;e;
where he con|firmed the de&s;tination of Parliament, in leaving the crown
fir&s;t to prince Edward, then to the lady Mary, next to the lady Elizabeth:
The two prince&s;&s;es he ob|liged, under the penalty of forfeiting their title
to the crown, not to marry with|out the con&s;ent of the council, which he
appointed for the government of his minor &s;on. After his own children, he
&s;ettled the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion on Frances Bran|don, marchione&s;s of Dor&s;et,
elde&s;t daughter to his &s;i&s;ter, the French Queen; then on Eleonor,
counte&s;s of Cumberland, the &s;econd daughter. In pa&s;&s;ing over the
po&s;terity of the Queen of Scots, his elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, he made u&s;e of
the power obtained from Parliament; but as he &s;ubjoined, that after the
failure of the French Queen's po&s;terity, the crown &s;hould de&s;cend to the
next lawful heir, it afterwards became a que&s;tion, whether the&s;e words
could be applied to the Scotti&s;h line. It was thought, that the&s;e princes
were not the next heirs after the hou&s;e of Suffolk, but before that hou&s;e,
and that Henry, by expre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf in this manner, meant entirely to
exclude them. The late injuries which he had received from the Scotch, had
irritated him extremely again&s;t that nation; and he maintained to the la&s;t
the character of violence and caprice, by which his life had been &s;o much
di&s;tingui&s;hed. Another circum&s;tance of his will may &s;ugge&s;t the
&s;ame reflection with regard to the &s;trange contrarieties of his temper and
conduct: He left money for ma&s;&s;es to be &s;aid for delivering his &s;oul
from pur|gatory; and tho' he de&s;troyed all tho&s;e in&s;titutions,
e&s;tabli&s;hed by his ance&s;tors, and others, for the benefit of
<HI>their</HI> &s;ouls, and had even left the doctrine of pur|gatory doubtful
in all the articles of faith which he publi&s;hed during his latter years, he
was yet determined, when matters came to the la&s;t, to take care, at lea&s;t,
of his own future repo&s;e, and to adhere to the &s;afer &s;ide of the
que&s;tion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See his will in Fuller, Heylin, and
Rymer, p. 110. There is no rea&s;onable ground to &s;u&s;pect its
authenticity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His character.</NOTE> IT is difficult to give
a ju&s;t &s;ummary of this prince's qualities: He was &s;o different from
him&s;elf in different parts of his reign, that, as is well remarked by lord
Herbert, his hi&s;tory is his be&s;t character and de&s;cription. The
ab&s;olute, uncontrouled authority which he maintained at home, and the regard
which he acquired among foreign nations, are circum&s;tances which entitle him
to the ap|pellation of a <HI>great</HI> prince; while his tyranny, and cruelty,
&s;eem to exclude him <PB N="279" REF="284"> from the character of a
<HI>good</HI> one. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, indeed, great vigour of mind, which
qualified him for exerci&s;ing dominion over men; courage, intrepidity,
vigilance, inflexibility: And tho' the&s;e qualities lay not always under the
guid|ance of a regular and folid judgment, they were accompanied with good
parts, and an exten&s;ive capacity; and every one dreaded a conte&s;t with a
man who was known never to yield, or to forgive, and who, in every
controver&s;y, was deter|mined, either to ruin him&s;elf or his antagoni&s;t. A
catalogue of his vices would comprehend many of the wor&s;t qualities incident
to human nature: Violence, cruelty, profu&s;ion, rapacity, inju&s;tice,
ob&s;tinacy, arrogance, bigotry, pre&s;ump|tion, caprice: But neither was he
&s;ubject to all the&s;e vices in the mo&s;t extreme degree, nor was he, at
intervals, altogether devoid of virtues: He was &s;incere, open, gallant,
liberal, and capable at lea&s;t of a temporary friend&s;hip and attach|ment. In
this re&s;pect he was unfortunate, that the incidents of his times &s;erved to
di&s;play his faults in their full light: The treatment which he met with from
the court of Rome, provoked him to violence; the danger of a revolt from his
&s;uper&s;titious &s;ubjects, &s;eemed to require the mo&s;t extreme
&s;everity. But it mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, be acknowledged, that his
&s;ituation tended to throw an additi|onal lu&s;tre on what was great and
magnanimous in his character: The emulation between the emperor and the French
King, rendered his alliance, notwith&s;tand|ing his impolitic conduct, of great
importance in Europe: The exten&s;ive powers of his prerogative, and the
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, not to &s;ay &s;lavi&s;h, di&s;po&s;ition of his Par|liament,
made it the more ea&s;y for him to a&s;&s;ume and maintain that entire
domi|nion by which his reign is &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed in the Engli&s;h
hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>IT may &s;eem a little extraordinary, that notwith&s;tanding his
cruelty, his ex|tortion, his violence, his arbitrary admini&s;tration, this
prince not only acquired the regard of his &s;ubjects; but never was the object
of their hatred: He &s;eems even in &s;ome degree to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to
the la&s;t, their love and affection<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol
I. p. 389.</NOTE>. His exterior qualities were advantageous, and fit to
captivate the multitude: His magnificence and per&s;onal bravery rendered him
illu&s;trious in vulgar eyes: And it may be &s;aid, with truth, that the
Engli&s;h in that age, were &s;o thoroughly &s;ub|dued, that, like ea&s;tern
&s;laves, they were inclined to admire even tho&s;e acts of violence and
tyranny, which were exerci&s;ed over them&s;elves, and at their own
expence.</P>
<P>WITH regard to foreign &s;tates, Henry appears long to have
&s;upported an in|tercour&s;e of friend&s;hip with Francis, more &s;incere and
di&s;intere&s;ted than u&s;ually takes place between neighbouring princes.
Their common jealou&s;y of the em|peror Charles, and &s;ome re&s;emblance in
their characters, (tho' the compari&s;on is <PB N="280" REF="285"> extremely to
the advantage of the French monarch) &s;erved as the cement of their mutual
amity. Francis is &s;aid to have been affected with the King's death, and to
have expre&s;&s;ed much regret for the lo&s;s. His own health began to decline:
He foretold, that he would not long &s;urvive his friend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Thou.</NOTE>: And he died in about two months after him.</P>
<P>THERE were ten Parliaments &s;ummoned by Henry the eighth, and
twenty|three &s;e&s;&s;ions held. The whole time in which the&s;e Parliaments
&s;at during this long reign, exceeded not three years and a half. It amounted
not to a year dur|ing the fir&s;t twenty years. The innovations in religion
obliged him afterwards to call the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies more frequently: But tho'
the&s;e were the mo&s;t important tran&s;actions that ever fell under the
cognizance of Parliament, their devoted at|tachment to Henry's will, joined to
their earne&s;t de&s;ire of returning &s;oon to their country &s;eats, produced
a very quick di&s;patch of the bills, and made the &s;e&s;&s;ions of &s;hort
duration. All the King's caprices were&punc; indeed, blindly complied with, and
no regard was payed to the &s;afety or liberty of the &s;ubject. Be&s;ides the
vio|lent pro&s;ecution of whatever he was plea&s;ed to call here&s;y, the laws
of trea&s;on were multiplied beyond all former precedent. Even words to the
di&s;paragement of the King, Queen, or royal i&s;&s;ue, were &s;ubjected to
that penalty; and &s;o little care was taken in framing the&s;e rigorous
&s;tatutes, that they contain obvious con|tradictions; in&s;omuch, that, had
they been &s;trictly executed, every man, with|out exception, mu&s;t have
fallen under the penalty of trea&s;on. By one &s;tatute<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">28 Hen. VIII. c. 7.</NOTE>, for in&s;tance, it was
declared trea&s;on to a&s;&s;ert the validity of the King's marriage, either
with Catherine of Arragon, or Anne Bo'eyn: By another<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">34, 35 Hen. VIII. c 1.</NOTE>, it was trea|&s;on to &s;ay any
thing to the di&s;paragement or &s;lander of the prince&s;&s;es, Mary and
Elizabeth; and to call them &s;purious would, no doubt, be con&s;trued to their
&s;lander. Nor would even a profound &s;ilence with regard to the&s;e delicate
points, be able to &s;ave a per&s;on from &s;uch penalties. For by the former
&s;tatute, whoever refu&s;ed to an&s;wer upon oath to any point contained in
that act, was &s;ubjected to the pains of trea&s;on. The King, therefore,
needed only to propo&s;e to any one a que&s;tion with regard to the legality of
either of his fir&s;t marriages: If the per|&s;on was &s;ilent, he was a
traytor by law: If he an&s;wered, either in the negative or in the affirmative,
he was no le&s;s a traytor. So mon&s;trous were the incon&s;i&s;tencies, which
aro&s;e from the furious pa&s;&s;ions of the King, and the &s;lavi&s;h
obedience of his Par|liaments. It is hard to &s;ay, whether the&s;e
contradictions were owing to Henry's precipitancy, or to a formed de&s;ign of
tyranny.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His laws.</NOTE> IT may not be improper to

with regard to police or commerce: Nothing can better <PB N="281" REF="286">
&s;how the genius of the age than &s;uch a review of the laws. The abolition of
the ancient religion contributed much to the regular execution of ju&s;tice.
While the catholic &s;uper&s;tition &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, there was no
po&s;&s;ibility of puni&s;hing any crimes in the clergy: The church would not
allow the magi&s;trate to try the offences of her members, and &s;he could not
her&s;elf inflict any civil penalties upon them. But Henry re&s;trained the&s;e
pernicious exemptions: The privilege of clergy was aboli&s;hed for the crimes
of petty trea&s;on, murder, and felony, to all under the degree of a
&s;ubdeacon<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">23 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>. But the
former &s;uper&s;tition not only protected crimes in the clergy: It exempted
al&s;o the laity from puni&s;hment, by affording them &s;helter in the churches
and &s;anctuaries. The Parliament re&s;trained the&s;e abu&s;es. It was fir&s;t
declared, that no fanctuaries were allowed in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">26 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>; next, in tho&s;e of

particulars<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">22 Hen. VIII. c. 14.</NOTE>. The only
expedient employed to &s;upport the military &s;pirit during this age, was the
reviving and extending &s;ome old laws, enacted for the encouragement of
archery, on which the defence of the kingdom was &s;uppo&s;ed very much to
depend. Every man was ordered to have a bow<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">3 Hen. VIII. c. 3.</NOTE>: Buts were ordered to be erected in
every pari&s;h<NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>: And every

prohibited<NOTE N="&sect;&sect;" PLACE="foot">3 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>. What
rendered the Engli&s;h bowmen more formidable was, that they carried halberts
with them, by which they were enabled, upon occa&s;ion, to engage in clo&s;e
fight with the enemy<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>. Frequent
mu&s;ters or ar|rays were al&s;o made of the people, even during time of peace;
and all men of &s;ub&s;tance were obliged to have a compleat &s;uit of armour
or harne&s;s, as it was called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 234. Stowe,
p. 515. Holling&s;hed, p. 947.</NOTE>. The martial &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h,
during that age, rendered this precaution, it was thought, &s;ufficient for the
defence of the nation; and as the King had then an ab&s;olute power of
commanding the &s;ervice of all his &s;ubjects, he could pre&s;ently, in ca&s;e
of danger, appoint new officers, and levy regiments, and collect an army as
numerous as he plea&s;ed. Where no faction or divi&s;ion prevailed among the
people, there was no foreign power that ever dared to think of invading
England. There is a &s;aying of Francis the fir&s;t, which &s;hows the
e&s;ti|mation in which the nation was held in Europe. That magnanimous prince
boa&s;ted, that, notwith&s;tanding the combination of Charles and Henry
again&s;t him, in the year 1524, he would be able to defend him&s;elf. Spain,
&s;ays he, has no money; the Low Countries have no &s;oldiers: And as to
England, my fron|tier <PB N="282" REF="287"> is &s;trong on that &s;ide<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. Daniel.</NOTE>. The city of London alone could

permission was granted to di&s;po&s;e of land by will<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">34 and 35 Hen. VIII. c. 5.</NOTE>. The Parliament were &s;o little
jealous of their privileges, (which indeed were &s;carce worth pre&s;erving)
that there is an in&s;tance of one Strode, who, becau&s;e he introduced into
the lower hou&s;e &s;ome bill regarding tin, was very &s;everely treated by the
Stannery courts of Cornwal: Heavy fines were impo&s;ed on him; and upon his
refu&s;al to pay, he was thrown into a dungeon, loaded with irons, and u&s;ed
in &s;uch a manner as brought his life in danger: Yet all the notice which the
Parliament took of this enormity, even in &s;uch an inferior court, was to
enact, that no man could be que&s;tioned afterwards for his conduct in
Parliament<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">4 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</NOTE>.
This prohibition, how|ever, mu&s;t only be extended to the inferior courts: For
as to the King and privy council, and &s;tar-chamber, they were &s;carce bound
by any law. There is a bill of tonnage and poundage, which &s;hows what
uncertain ideas the Parliament had formed both of their own privileges and of
the rights of the &s;overeign<NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">6 Hen.
VIII. c. 14.</NOTE>. This duty had been voted to every King &s;ince Edward the
fourth, during the term of his own life: Yet Henry had already been allowed to
levy it &s;ix years without any law; and tho' there had been four Parliaments
a&s;&s;embled, no at|tention had been given either to grant it to him
regularly, or re&s;train him from levying it. At la&s;t, they re&s;olved to
give him that &s;upply; but even in this conce&s;&s;ion, they &s;how
them&s;elves plainly at a lo&s;s to determine whether they grant it, or whether
he has a right of him&s;elf to levy it. They &s;ay, that the im|po&s;ition was
made to endure during the natural life of the late King, and no longer: They
yet blame the merchants who had not paid to the pre&s;ent King that duty: They
ob&s;erve, that the law for tonnage and poundage was expired; yet make no
&s;cruple to call that impo&s;ition the King's due: They affirm, that he had
&s;u&s;tained great and manifold lo&s;&s;es by tho&s;e who had defraud|ed him
of this duty: And to provide a remedy, they vote him that &s;upply dur|ing his
life, and no longer. It is remarkable, that notwith&s;tanding this la&s;t
clau&s;e, all his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, for more than a century, continued in the
like irregular practice: If a practice may de&s;erve that epithet, which all
the world acquie&s;ced in, and which gave no offence. But when Charles the
fir&s;t attempted to con|tinue <PB N="283" REF="288"> in the &s;ame cour&s;e,
which had now received the &s;anction of many genera|tions, &s;o much were the
opinions of men altered, that a furious tempe&s;t was ex|cited by it, and
hi&s;torians, partial or ignorant, &s;till repre&s;ent that mea&s;ure as a
mo&s;t violent and unprecedented enormity in that unhappy prince.</P>
<P>THE foreign commerce of England, during this age, was mo&s;tly
confined to the Netherlands. The inhabitants of the Low Countries bought the
Engli&s;h commodities, and di&s;tributed them into the other parts of Europe.
Hence the mutual dependance of the&s;e countries on each other; and the great
lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by both, in ca&s;e of a rupture. During all the variations
of politics, the &s;ove|reigns always avoided the coming to this extremity; and
tho' the King bore a much greater friend&s;hip to Francis, the propen&s;ity of
the nation always lay to|wards the emperor.</P>
<P>IN 1528, ho&s;tilities commenced between England and the Low
Countries; but were &s;oon &s;topt by mutual agreement. While the Flemi&s;h
were not allowed to purcha&s;e cloth in England, the Engli&s;h merchants could
not buy it of the cloathiers, and the cloathiers were obliged to di&s;mi&s;s
their workmen, who began to be tumultuous for want of bread. The cardinal, to
appea&s;e them, &s;ent for the merchants, and ordered them to buy cloth as
u&s;ual: They told him, that they could not di&s;po&s;e of it as u&s;ual; and
notwith&s;tanding all his menaces, he could get no other an&s;wer from
them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">olio 174.</NOTE>. An agreement was at la&s;t made to con|tinue the
commerce between the &s;tates, even during war.</P>
<P>THE foreign artificers much &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the Engli&s;h in
dexterity, indu&s;try, and frugality; and hence the violent animo&s;ity, which
the latter, on many occa&s;ions, expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t any of the former who
were &s;ettled in England. They had the a&s;&s;urance to complain, that all
their cu&s;tomers went to foreign trade&s;men; and in the year 1517, being
moved by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">editious &s;ermons of
one Dr. Bele, and the intrigues of Lincoln, a broker, they rai&s;ed an
in&s;urrection. The appren|tices, and others of the poorer &s;ort, in London,
began by breaking up the pri|&s;ons, where &s;ome per&s;ons were confined for
in&s;ulting foreigners. They next pro|ceeded to the hou&s;e of Meutas, a
Frenchman, much hated by them; where they committed great di&s;orders; killed
&s;ome of his &s;ervants, and plundered his goods. The mayor could not
appea&s;e them; nor Sir Thomas Moore, late under &s;heriff, tho' extremely
re&s;pected in the city. They al&s;o threatned cardinal Wol&s;ey with &s;ome
in&s;ult; and he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to fortify his hou&s;e, and put
him&s;elf on his guard. Tired at la&s;t with the&s;e di&s;orders, they
di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves; and the earls of Shrew&s;bury and Surrey &s;eized
&s;ome of them. A proclamation was <PB N="284" REF="289"> i&s;&s;ued, that
women &s;hould not meet together to babble and talk, and that all men &s;hould
keep their wives in their hou&s;es. Next day the duke of Norfolk came into the
city, at the head of thirteen hundred armed men, and made enquiry into the
tumult. Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e and Lincoln, and
&s;everal others, were &s;ent to the Power, and condemned for trea&s;on.
Lincoln, and thirteen more were executed. The other per&s;ons, to the number of
four hundred, were brought before the King with ropes about their necks, fell
on their knees, and cried for mercy. Henry knew at that time to pardon; he
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them all without further puni&s;h|ment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, 505. Holling&s;hed, 840.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SO great was the number of foreign artizans in the city, that at
lea&s;t fifteen thou&s;and Flemi&s;h alone were at one time obliged to leave
it, by an order from the council, when Henry became jealous of their favour for
Queen Catherine<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le Grand, vol. III. p.
232.</NOTE>. Henry him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es, in an edict of the &s;tar-chamber,
printed among the &s;tatutes, that the foreigners &s;tarved the natives; and
obliged them from idle|ne&s;s to have recour&s;e to theft, murder, and other
enormities<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">21 Hen. VIII.</NOTE>. He al&s;o
a&s;&s;erts, that the va&s;t multitudes of the foreigners rai&s;ed the price of
grain and bread<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. And to prevent the
increa&s;e of the evil, all foreign artificers were prohibited to have above
two foreigners in their hou&s;e, either journeymen or apprentices. A like
jealoufy aro&s;e again&s;t the foreign merchants; and to comply with it, a law
was enacted obliging all denizons to pay the duties impo&s;ed upon aliens<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">22 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</NOTE>. The Parliament had done
better to have encouraged foreign merchants and artizans to come over to
England; which might have excited the emulation of the natives, and improved
their &s;kill. The pri&s;oners in the kingdom, for debts and crimes, are
a&s;&s;erted, in an act of parliament, to be &s;ixty thou&s;and per&s;ons and
above<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">3 Hen. VIII. c. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is a remarkable clau&s;e in a &s;tatute pa&s;&s;ed near
the beginning of this reign<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">3 Hen. VIII.
c. 8.</NOTE>, by which we might be induced to believe, that England was
ex|tremely decayed from the flouri&s;hing condition which it had attained in
former times. It had been enacted in the reign of Edward the &s;econd, that no
magi|&s;trate in town or borough, who by his office ought to keep a&s;&s;ize,
&s;hould, dur|ing the continuance of his magi&s;tracy, fell either in
whole&s;ale or retail, any wine or victuals. This law &s;eemed very equitable,
in order to prevent fraud or bye|ends in fixing the a&s;&s;ize: Yet the law is
repealed in this reign. The rea&s;on a&s;|&s;igned is, that 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;ince the making of that &s;tatute and
ordinance, many and the mo&s;t part of all the cities, boroughs, and towns
corporate, within the realm of England, are fallen in ruin and decay, and are
not inhabited by merchants, <PB N="285" REF="290"> and men of &s;uch
&s;ub&s;tance as at the time of making that &s;tatute: For at this day, the
dwellers and inhabitants of the &s;ame cities and boroughs are commonly bakers,
vintners, fi&s;hmongers, and other victualers, and there remain few others to
bear the offices."</Q> Men have &s;uch a propen&s;ity to exalt pa&s;t times
beyond the pre&s;ent, that it &s;eems dangerous to credit this rea&s;oning of
the Parlia|ment, without further evidence to &s;upport it. So different are the
views in which the &s;ame object appears, that &s;ome may be inclined to draw
an oppo&s;ite inference from this fact. A more regular police was establi&s;hed
in the reign of Henry the eighth, and a &s;tricter admini&s;tration of
ju&s;tice; and advantage which induced the men of property to leave the
provincial towns, and to retire into the country. Cardinal Wol&s;ey, in a
&s;peech to the Parliament, repre&s;ented it as a proof of the increa&s;e of
riches, that the cu&s;toms had increa&s;ed beyond what they were for|merly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall, folio 110.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT if there was really a decay of commerce and indu&s;try, and
population in England, the &s;tatutes of this reign, except by aboli&s;hing
mona&s;teries, and re|trenching holidays, a circum&s;tance of con&s;iderable
moment, were not in other re&s;pects well calculated to revive them. The fixing
the wages of artificers was attempted<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">6 Hen.

&s;tatutes<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Hen. VIII. c. 14. 6 Hen. VIII. c.

and other mini&s;ters were empowered to fix the price of poultry, chee&s;e, and
butter<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">25 Hen. VIII. c. 2.</NOTE>. A &s;tatute
was even pa&s;&s;ed to fix the price of beef, pork, mutton, and veal<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">24 Hen. VIII. c. 3.</NOTE>. Beef and pork were ordered
to be &s;old at a halfpenny a pound: Mutton and veal at a halfpenny half a

butcher's meat were the food of the poorer &s;ort. This act was afterwards
repealed<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">33 Hen. VIII. c. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE practice of depopulating the country, by abandoning tillage,
and throw|ing the lands into pa&s;turage, &s;till continued<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 392.</NOTE>; as appears by
the new laws which were enacted again&s;t that practice. The King was entitled
to half the rents of the land, where any farm hou&s;es were allowed to go to
decay<NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">6 Hen. VIII. c. 5. 7 Hen. VIII. c.
1.</NOTE>. The un&s;kilful hu&s;bandry was probably the cau&s;e why the
proprietors found no profit in tillage. The number of &s;heep allowed to be
kept in one flock, was re&s;trained to two thou&s;and<NOTE N="&Verbar;&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">25 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>. Sometimes, &s;ays the &s;tatute, one
proprietor or farmer would keep a flock of twenty-four thou&s;and. It is
remarkable, that the Parliament a&s;cribes the increa&s;ing price of &s;heep
and mutton, to this increa&s;e of &s;heep: Be|cau&s;e, &s;ay they, the
commodity being got into few hands, the price of it is rai&s;ed 
<PB N="286" REF="291"> at plea&s;ure<NOTE N="&sect;&sect;" PLACE="foot">25 Hen.

monopolized. Intere&s;t was fixed during this reign at ten per cent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">37 Hen. VIII. c 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME laws were made with regard to beggars and vagabonds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">22 Hen. VIII. c. 12. 22 Hen. VIII. c. 5.</NOTE>; one

recom|mend to a benevolent legi&s;lator; which &s;eems, at fir&s;t fight, the

in &s;uch a manner, as to at|tain the end without de&s;troying indu&s;try. The
convents formerly were a &s;upport to the poor; but at the &s;ame
time&punc;tended to encourage idlene&s;s and beggary.</P>
<P>HENRY, as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;ome talents for
letters, was an encourager of them in others. He founded Trinity college in
Cambridge, and gave it very ample endowments. Wol&s;ey founded Chri&s;t Church
in Oxford, and intended to call it Cardinal college: But upon his fall, which
happened before he had en|tirely fini&s;hed his &s;cheme, the King &s;eized all
the revenues; and this violence, above all the other misfortunes of that great
mini&s;ter, is &s;aid to have given him the greate&s;t anxiety and concern<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 117.</NOTE>. But Henry afterwards
re&s;tored the revenues of the college, and only changed the name. The cardinal
founded in Oxford the fir&s;t chair for teaching Greek; and this novelty rent
that univer&s;ity into the mo&s;t violent factions, which frequently came to
blows. The whole &s;tudents di|vided them&s;elves into parties, which bore the
names of Greeks and Trojans, and &s;ometimes fought with as great animo&s;ity
as was formerly exerci&s;ed by tho&s;e ho&s;tile nations. The ri&s;e of the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the regency.</NOTE> THE late King,
by the regulations, which he impo&s;ed on the govern|ment of his infant &s;on,
as well as by the limitations of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, had projected to reign
even after his decea&s;e; and he imagined, that his mini&s;ters, who had always
been &s;o ob&s;equious to him during his life-time, would never afterwards
depart from the plan, which he had traced out to them. He fixed the majority of
the Prince at the completion of his eigh|teenth year; and as Edward was at
pre&s;ent only a few months pa&s;t nine, he ap|pointed &s;ixteen executors; to
whom, during the minority, he entru&s;ted the go|vernment <PB N="288" REF="293"> of the King and kingdom. Their names were, Cranmer, archbi&s;hop of
Canterbury; lord Wriothe&s;ley, chancellor; lord St. John, great ma&s;ter; lord
Ru&s;&s;el, privy &s;eal; the earl of Hertford, chamberlain; vi&s;count
Li&s;le, admiral; Ton&s;tal, bi&s;hop of Durham; Sir Anthony Brown, ma&s;ter of
hor&s;e; Sir William Paget, &s;ecretary of &s;tate; Sir Edward North,
chancellor of the court of aug|mentations; Sir Edward Montague, chief ju&s;tice
of the common pleas; judge Bromley, Sir Anthony Denny, and Sir William Herbert,
chief gentlemen of the privy chamber; Sir Edward Wotton, trea&s;urer of Calais;
Dr. Wotton, dean of Canterbury. To the&s;e &s;ixteen executors, with whom was
entru&s;ted the whole regal authority, were added twelve coun&s;ellors, who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no immediate power, and could only a&s;&s;i&s;t with their
advice, when any affair was laid before them. The council was compo&s;ed of the
earls of Arundel and E&s;&s;ex; Sir Thomas Cheyney, trea&s;urer of the
hou&s;ehold; Sir John Gage, comptroller; Sir Anthony Wingfield, vice
chamberlain; Sir William Petre, &s;ecretary of &s;tate; Sir Richard Rich, Sir
John Baker, Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Thomas Seymour, Sir Richard Southwel, and Sir
Edmund Peckham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memor. vol. ii. p. 457.</NOTE>.
The u&s;ual caprice of Henry appears &s;omewhat in this nomination; while he
appointed &s;everal per&s;ons of inferior &s;ta|tion among his executors, and
gave only the place of coun&s;ellor to a per&s;on of &s;uch high rank as the
earl of Arundel, and to Sir Thomas Seymour, the King's uncle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Innovations in the regency.</NOTE> BUT the
fir&s;t act of the executors and coun&s;ellors was to depart from the
de&s;tination of the late King in a material article. No &s;ooner were they
met, than it was &s;ugge&s;ted, that the government would lo&s;e its dignity,
for want of &s;ome head, who might repre&s;ent the royal maje&s;ty, who might
receive addre&s;&s;es from foreign amba&s;&s;adors, to whom di&s;patches from
Engli&s;h mini&s;ters abroad might be carried, and who&s;e name might be
employed in all orders and proclamations: And as the King's will &s;eemed to
contain a defect in this particular, it was concluded ne|ce&s;&s;ary to
&s;upply it, by choo&s;ing a protector; who, tho' he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s all
the exterior &s;ymbols of royal dignity, &s;hould yet be bound, in every
exerci&s;e of power, to follow the opinion of the executors<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 5.</NOTE>. This propo&s;al was very
di&s;agreeable to chancellor Wriothe&s;ely. That magi&s;trate, a man of an
active &s;pirit and high ambition, found him&s;elf, by his office, entitled to
the fir&s;t rank in the regency after the primate; and as he knew, that that
prelate had no talent nor inclination for &s;tate affairs, he hoped, that the
direction of public bu&s;ine&s;s would of cour&s;e devolve in a great mea&s;ure
upon him&s;elf. He oppo&s;ed, therefore, this propo&s;al of choo&s;ing a
protector; and repre&s;ented that innovation as an infringe|ment of the King's
will, which, being corroborated by act of parliament, ought 
<PB N="289" REF="294"> in every thing to be a law to them, and could not be
altered but by the &s;ame authority, which had e&s;tabli&s;hed it. The
executors and coun&s;ellors were mo&s;tly courtiers, who had been rai&s;ed by
Henry's favour, not men of high birth or great dependances; and as they had
been &s;ufficiently accu&s;tomed to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion during the reign of the
late monarch, and had no preten&s;ions to govern the na|tion by their own
authority, they acquie&s;ced the more willingly in a propo&s;al, which &s;eemed
calculated for pre&s;erving public peace and tranquillity. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somer&s;et pro|tector.</NOTE> It being
therefore agreed to name a protector, the choice fell of cour&s;e on the earl
of Hartford, who, as he was the King's maternal uncle, was &s;trongly

could never have any &s;eparate intere&s;t, which might engage him to endanger

their former commi&s;|&s;ions, and took out new ones in the name of the young
King. The bi&s;hops them&s;elves were con&s;trained to make a like
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Care was taken to in&s;ert in their new commi&s;&s;ions, that

<P>THE executors &s;howed, in their next mea&s;ure, a more
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive deference to Henry's will; becau&s;e many of them found their
own account in it. The late King had intended, before his death, to make a new
creation of nobility, in or|der to &s;upply the place of tho&s;e who had fallen
by former attainders, or the fai|lure of i&s;&s;ue; and that he might enable
the per&s;ons to &s;upport their new dig|nity, he had re&s;olved either to
be&s;tow e&s;tates on them, or advance them to higher offices. He had even gone
&s;o far as to inform them of this re&s;olution; and in his will, he charged
his executors to make good all his promi&s;es<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Fuller, Heylin, and Rymer.</NOTE>. That they might a&s;certain his
intentions in the mo&s;t authentic manner, Sir William Paget, Sir Anthony
Denny, and Sir William Herbert, with whom Henry had always conver&s;ed in a
familiar manner, were called before the board of regency; and having given
evidence of what they knew concerning the King's promi&s;es, their te&s;timony
was relied on, and the executors proceeded to the fulfilling the&s;e
en|gagements. Hartford was created duke of Somer&s;et, mar&s;chal and lord

e&s;tates on the&s;e new noblemen, was deferred till a more convenient
op|portunity. Some of them, however, particularly Somer&s;et the protector,
were, in the mean time, endowed with &s;piritual preferments, deanories and
preben|daries. For among many other inva&s;ions of eccle&s;ia&s;tical
privileges and properties, this irregular practice, of be&s;towing &s;piritual
benefices on laymen, began now to prevail.</P>
<P>THE earl of Southampton had always been engaged in an oppo&s;ite
party to Somer&s;et; and it was not likely that factions, which had &s;ecretly
prevailed, even during the arbitrary reign of Henry, &s;hould be
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed in the weak admini&s;tra|tion, which u&s;ually attends a
minority. The former nobleman, that he might have the greater lei&s;ure for
attending to &s;tate-affairs, had, of him&s;elf and from his own authority, put
the great &s;eal in commi&s;&s;ion, and had empowered four lawyers, Southwel,
Tregonel, Oliver, and Bella&s;is, to execute in his ab&s;ence the office of
chancellor. This mea&s;ure &s;eems very exceptionable; and the more &s;o, that
two of the commi&s;&s;ioners being canoni&s;ts, the lawyers &s;u&s;pected,
that, by this nomination, the chancellor had intended to di&s;credit the common
law. Com|plaints were made to the council; who, influenced by the protector,
gladly laid hold of this opportunity to depre&s;s Southampton. They con&s;ulted
the judges with regard to &s;o unu&s;ual a ca&s;e, and received for an&s;wer,
that the commi&s;&s;ion was illegal, and that the chancellor, by his
pre&s;umption in granting it, had ju&s;tly forfeited the &s;eals, and was even
liable to puni&s;hment. The council &s;ummoned him to appear before them; and
tho' he maintained, that he held his office by the late King's will, founded on
an act of parliament, and could not lo&s;e it with|out a trial before the
Parliament; that if the commi&s;&s;ion, which he had granted, was found
illegal, it might be declared null and void, and all the ill con&s;equences of
it be ea&s;ily remedied; and that the depriving him of the &s;eals for an error
of this nature, was a precedent by which any other innovation might be
authorized; the council, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e topics of defence,
declared that he had forfeited his office; that a fine &s;hould be impo&s;ed
upon him; and that he &s;hould be confined to his own hou&s;e during
plea&s;ure<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 979.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' the removal of Southampton encrea&s;ed the protector's
authority, and tended to &s;uppre&s;s factions in the regency; yet was not
Somer&s;et contented with this advantage: His ambition carried him to &s;eek
&s;till farther acqui&s;itions. Un|der pretence, that the vote of the
executors, choo&s;ing him protector, was not a &s;uffi|cient 
<PB N="291" REF="296"> foundation for his authority, he procured a patent from
the young King, by which he entirely overturned the will of Harry the eighth,
produced a total revolution in the government, and may &s;eem even to have
&s;ubverted all the laws of the kingdom. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 March.</NOTE> He named him&s;elf protector
with full regal power, and appointed a council, con&s;i&s;ting of all the
former coun&s;ellors, and all the execu|tors except Southampton: He re&s;erved
a power of naming any other coun&s;ellors at plea&s;ure: And he was bound to
con&s;ult with &s;uch only as he thought proper. The protector and his council
were likewi&s;e empowered to act at di&s;cretion, and to execute whatever they
thought &s;erviceable to the government, without incur|ring any penalty or
forfeiture from any law, &s;tatute, proclamation, or ordinance
what&s;oever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. Records, No. 6.</NOTE>.
Even had this patent been le&s;s exorbitant in its conce&s;&s;ions, and had it
been drawn by directions from the executors appointed by Henry, its le|gality
might ju&s;tly be que&s;tioned; &s;ince it &s;eems e&s;&s;ential to a tru&s;t
of this na|ture to be exerci&s;ed by the per&s;ons entru&s;ted, nor can it be
delegated to others: But as the patent, by its very tenor, where the executors
are not &s;o much as mentioned, appears to have been &s;urreptitiou&s;ly
obtained from a minor King, the protector&s;hip of Somer&s;et was a plain
u&s;urpation, which it is impo&s;&s;ible by any ar|guments to ju&s;tify. The
connivance, however, of the executors, and their pre|&s;ent acquie&s;cence in
the new e&s;tabli&s;hment, made it be univer&s;ally &s;ubmitted to; and as the
young King di&s;covered an extreme attachment to his uncle, who was al&s;o in
the main a man of moderation and probity, no objections were made to his power
and title. All men of &s;en&s;e, likewi&s;e, as they &s;aw the nation divided
by the religious zeal of the oppo&s;ite &s;ects, thought it the more
nece&s;&s;ary to entru&s;t the government to one per&s;on, who might check the
exorbitancies of party, and en&s;ure the public tranquillity. And tho' &s;ome
clau&s;es of the patent &s;eemed to imply a formal &s;ubver&s;ion of all
liberty or limited government, &s;o little jealou&s;y was then u&s;ually
entertained on that head, that no exception was ever taken at bare claims or
preten&s;ions of this nature, advanced by any per&s;on, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of
&s;overeign power. The actual exerci&s;e alone of arbitrary admini&s;tration,
and that in many and great and flagrant and unpopular in&s;tances, was able
&s;ome|times to give &s;ome umbrage to the nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reformation compleated.</NOTE> THE
exten&s;ive authority and imperious character of Henry, had retained the
par|tizans of both religions in &s;ubjection; but upon his decea&s;e, the hopes
of the prote&s;|tants and the fears of the catholics began to revive, and the
zeal of the&s;e parties pro|duced every where di&s;putes and animo&s;ities, the
u&s;ual preludes of more fatal divi&s;ions. The protector had long been
regarded as the &s;ecret partizan of the reformers; and being now freed from
re&s;traint, he &s;crupled not to expre&s;s his intention of 
<PB N="292" REF="297"> correcting all the abu&s;es of the antient religion, and
of adopting &s;till more of the prote&s;tant innovations. He took care, that
all the per&s;ons, to whom he entru&s;ted the King's education, &s;hould be
attached to the &s;ame principles&punc; and as the young Prince di&s;covered a
zeal for every kind of literature, e&s;pecially the theological, far beyond his
tender years, all men fore&s;aw, in the cour&s;e of his reign, the total
abo|lition of the catholic faith; and they early began to declare them&s;elves
in favour of tho&s;e tenets, which were likely to become in the end entirely
prevalent. Af|ter Southampton's fall, few members of the council &s;eemed to
retain any attach|ment to the Romi&s;h communion; and mo&s;t of the
coun&s;ellors appeared even &s;anguine in forwarding the progre&s;s of the
reformation. The riches which mo&s;t of them had acquired from the &s;poils of
the clergy, induced them to widen the breach between England and Rome; and by
e&s;tabli&s;hing a contra|riety of &s;peculative tenets, as well as of
di&s;cipline and wor&s;hip, to render a coali|tion with the mother church
altogether impracticable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals,
Heylin.</NOTE>. Their rapacity al&s;o, the chief &s;ource of their reforming
&s;pirit, was excited by the pro&s;pect of pillaging the &s;ecular, as they had
already done the regular clergy; and they knew, that, while any &s;hare of the
old principles remained, or any regard to the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, they never
could hope to &s;ucceed in their preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE numerous and burthen&s;ome &s;uper&s;titions, with which the
Romi&s;h church was loaded, had thrown many of the reformers, by the &s;pirit
of oppo&s;ition, into an enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;train of devotion; and all rites,
ceremonies, pomp, order, and exterior ob&s;ervances were zealou&s;ly
aboli&s;hed by them, as hindrances of their &s;pi|ritual contemplation, and
ob&s;tructions to their immediate conver&s;e with heaven. Many circum&s;tances
concurred to enflame this daring &s;pirit; the novelty it&s;elf of their
doctrines, the triumph of making pro&s;elytes, the furious per&s;ecutions to
which they were expo&s;ed, their animo&s;ity again&s;t the antient tenets and
practices, and the nece&s;&s;ity of procuring the concurrence of the laity, by
depre&s;&s;ing the hier|archy, and by tendering to them the plunder of the
eccle&s;ia&s;tics. Wherever the re|formation prevailed over the oppo&s;ition of
civil authority, this genius of religion appeared in its full extent, and was
attended with con&s;equences, which, tho' le&s;s durable, were, for &s;ome
time, no le&s;s dangerous than tho&s;e which were con|nected with the antient
&s;uper&s;tition. But as the magi&s;trate took the lead in Eng|land, the
tran&s;ition was more gradual; much of the antient religion was &s;till
pre|&s;erved; and a rea&s;onable degree of &s;ubordination was retained in
di&s;cipline, as well as &s;ome pomp, order, and ceremony in public
wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>THE protector, in his &s;chemes for advancing the reformation,
had always recour&s;e to the councils of Cranmer, who, being a man of
moderation and pru|dence, <PB N="293" REF="298"> was aver&s;e to all violent
changes, and was determined to bring over the people, by in&s;en&s;ible
innovations, to that &s;y&s;tem of doctrine and di&s;cipline, which he
e&s;teemed the mo&s;t pure and perfect. He probably al&s;o fore&s;aw, that a
&s;y&s;tem, which carefully avoided the extremes of reformation, was likely to
be mo&s;t la&s;t|ing; and that a devotion, merely &s;piritual, was fitted only
for the fir&s;t fervours of a new &s;ect, and upon the relaxation of the&s;e
naturally gave place to the inroads of &s;uper&s;tition. He &s;eems therefore
to have intended the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a hierarchy, which, being &s;uited to
a great and &s;ettled government, might &s;tand as a perpetual barrier
again&s;t Rome, and might retain the reverence of the people, even after their
enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal was dimini&s;hed or entirely evaporated.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardiner's oppo&s;ition.</NOTE> THE per&s;on,
who oppo&s;ed, with greate&s;t authority, any farther advances towards
reformation, was Gardiner, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; who, tho' he had not
ob|tained a place in the coun&s;el of regency, on account of &s;ome late
di&s;gu&s;ts, which he had given to Henry, was entitled, by his age,
experience, and capacity, to the highe&s;t tru&s;t and confidence of his party.
This prelate continued &s;till to magnify the great wi&s;dom and learning of
the late King, which were generally and &s;incerely admired by the nation; and
he in&s;i&s;ted on the prudence of per&s;e|vering, at lea&s;t till the young
King's majority, in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical model, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by that
great monarch. He defended the u&s;e of images, which were now very openly
attacked by the prote&s;tants; and he repre&s;ented them as &s;erviceable in
maintaining a &s;en&s;e of religion among the illiterate multitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 712.</NOTE>. He even deigned to write an apology
for <HI>holy water,</HI> which bi&s;hop Ridley had decried in a &s;ermon; and
he maintained, that, by the power of the Almighty, it might be rendered an
in&s;trument of doing good; as much as the &s;hadow of St. Peter, the hem of
our Saviour's garment, or the &s;pittle and clay laid upon the eyes of the
blind<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 724.</NOTE>. Above all,
he in&s;i&s;ted, that the laws ought to be ob&s;erved, that the con&s;titution
ought to be pre&s;erved inviolate, and that it was dangerous to follow the will
of the &s;overeign, in oppo&s;ition to an act of parliament<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 228. Fox, vol. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' there remained at that time in England an idea of laws
and a con&s;ti|tution, &s;ufficient at lea&s;t to furni&s;h a topic of argument
to &s;uch as were di&s;con|tented with the pre&s;ent exerci&s;e of authority;
this plea could &s;carcely, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, be maintained with any
plau&s;ibility by Gardiner. An act of par|liament had inve&s;ted the crown with
a legi&s;lative power; and royal proclama|tions, even during a minority, were
armed with the force and authority of laws. The protector, finding him&s;elf
&s;upported by this &s;tatute, was determined to em|ploy his influence in
favour of the reformers; and having &s;u&s;pended, during the interval, the
authority of the bi&s;hops, he appointed a general vi&s;itation to be 
<PB N="294" REF="299"> made in all the dioce&s;es of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. Cranm. p. 146, 147, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The vi&s;itors
con&s;i&s;ted of a mixture of clergy and laity, and had &s;ix circuits
a&s;&s;igned them. The chief purpo&s;e of their in&s;tructions was, be&s;ides
correcting immoralities and irregularities in the clergy, to aboli&s;h the
antient &s;uper&s;titions, and to bring the di&s;cipline and wor&s;hip
&s;ome|what nearer the practice of the reformed churches. The moderation of
Somer&s;et and Cranmer is apparent in the conduct of this delicate affair. The
vi&s;itors were enjoined to retain for the pre&s;ent all images which had not
been abu&s;ed to idolatry; and to in&s;truct the people not to de&s;pi&s;e
&s;uch ceremonies as were not yet abrogated, but only to beware of &s;ome
particular &s;uper&s;titions, &s;uch as the &s;prinkling their beds with holy
water, the ringing of bells, or u&s;ing of ble&s;&s;ed candles, in order to
drive away the devil<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p.
28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT nothing required more the correcting hand of authority, than
the abu&s;e of preaching, which was now generally employed, throughout England,
in de|fending the antient practices and &s;uper&s;titions. The court of
augmentations, in order to ea&s;e the King of the annuities paid to monks, had
commonly placed them in the vacant churches; and the&s;e men were led by
intere&s;t, as well as in|clination, to &s;upport tho&s;e principles, which had
been invented for the profit of the clergy. Orders therefore were given to
re&s;train the topics of their &s;ermons: Twelve homilies were publi&s;hed,
which they were enjoined to read to the people: And all of them were
prohibited, without expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion, to preach any where but in their
pari&s;h churches. The de&s;ign of this injunction was to throw a re&s;traint
on the catholic divines; while the prote&s;tant, by the grant of particu|lar
licences, &s;hould be allowed unbounded liberty.</P>
<P>BONNER made &s;ome oppo&s;ition to the&s;e mea&s;ures; but
&s;oon after retracted and acquie&s;ced. Gardiner was more high-&s;pirited and
more &s;teddy. He repre|&s;ented the peril of perpetual innovations, and the
nece&s;&s;ity of adhering to &s;ome &s;y&s;tem. 
<Q REND="inline">"'Tis a dangerous thing," &s;aid he, "to u&s;e
too much freedom, in re&s;earches of this kind. If you cut the old canal, the
water is apt to run fur|ther than you have a mind to. If you indulge the humour
of novelty, you cannot put a &s;top to people's demands, nor govern their
indi&s;cretions at plea|&s;ure. For my part," &s;aid he, on another occa&s;ion,
"my &s;ole concern is to manage the third and la&s;t act of my life with
decency, and to make a hand|&s;ome exit off the &s;tage. Provided this point is
&s;ecured, I am not &s;ollicitous about the re&s;t. I am already by nature
condemned to death: No man can give me a pardon from this &s;entence; nor &s;o
much as procure me a reprieve. To &s;peak my mind, and to act as my
con&s;cience directs, are two branches of liberty, which I can never part with.
Sincerity in &s;peech, and integrity in <PB N="295" REF="300"> action, are
entertaining qualities: They will &s;tick by a man, when every thing el&s;e
takes its leave; and I mu&s;t not re&s;ign them upon any con&s;ideration. The
be&s;t on it is, if I do not throw them away my&s;elf, no man can force them
from me: But if I give them up, then am I ruined by my&s;elf, and de&s;erve to
lo&s;e all my preferments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p. 228. ex

This oppo&s;ition of Gardiner drew on him the in|dignation of the council; and
he was &s;ent to the Fleet, where he was u&s;ed with &s;ome har&s;hne&s;s and
&s;everity.</P>
<P>ONE of the chief objections, urged by Gardiner again&s;t the new
homilies, was that they defined with the mo&s;t metaphy&s;ical preci&s;ion the
doctrine of grace, and of ju&s;tification by faith; points, he thought, which
it was &s;uperfluous for any man to know exactly, and which certainly exceeded
much the comprehen&s;ion of the vulgar. A famous martyrologi&s;t calls
Gardiner, on account of this opinion, 
<Q REND="inline">"an in&s;en&s;ible a&s;s, and one that had no
feeling of God's &s;pirit in the matter of ju&s;tification<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. II.</NOTE>."</Q> The meane&s;t prote&s;tant imagined at
that time, that he had a full comprehen&s;ion of all tho&s;e my&s;terious
doctrines, and he heartily de&s;pi&s;ed the mo&s;t learned and knowing per&s;on
of the antient religion. It is indeed certain, that the reformers were very
fortunate in their doctrine of ju&s;tification, and might venture to promi&s;e
on its &s;ucce&s;s, in oppo&s;ition to all the ceremonies, &s;hows, and
&s;uper&s;titions of popery. By exalting Chri&s;t and his &s;ufferings, and
renounc|ing all claim to independent merit in our&s;elves, it was calculated to
become po|pular, and coincided with tho&s;e principles of panegyric and of
&s;elf-aba&s;ement, which generally have place in religion.</P>
<P>TONSTAL, bi&s;hop of Durham, having, as well as Gardiner, made
&s;ome op|po&s;ition to the new regulations, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the
council-board; but no farther &s;everity was, for the pre&s;ent, exerci&s;ed
again&s;t him. He was a man of perfect moderation, and of the mo&s;t
unexceptionable character in the kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign af|fairs.</NOTE> THE &s;ame religious
zeal which engaged Somer&s;et to promote the reformation at home, led him to
carry his attention to foreign countries; where the intere&s;ts of the
prote&s;tants were now expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent danger. The Roman
pontiff, with much reluctance and after long delays, had at la&s;t &s;ummoned a
ge|neral council, which was a&s;&s;embled at Trent, and was employed in
correcting the abu&s;es of the church, and in a&s;certaining her doctrines. The
emperor, who de|&s;ired to repre&s;s the power of the court of Rome, as well as
gain over the prote|&s;tants, promoted the former object of the council; the
pope, who found his own greatne&s;s &s;o deeply intere&s;ted, de&s;ired rather
to employ them in the latter. He <PB N="296" REF="301"> gave in&s;tructions to
his legates, who pre&s;ided in the council, to protract the de|bates, and to

<P>THE emperor, no le&s;s than the pope, had learned to make
religion &s;ub&s;ervient to his ambition and policy. He was re&s;olved to
employ the imputation of here&s;y as a pretence for &s;ubduing the prote&s;tant
princes, and oppre&s;&s;ing the liberties of Germany; but found it requi&s;ite
to cover his intentions under a deep artifice, and to prevent the combination
of his adver&s;aries. He &s;eparated the Palatine and the elector of
Brandenburgh from the prote&s;tant confederacy: He took arms again&s;t the
elector of Saxony, and the landgrave of He&s;&s;e: By the fortune of war he
made the former pri&s;oner: He employed treachery and prevarication again&s;t
the latter, and detained him captive, by breaking a &s;afe-conduct which he had
granted him. He &s;eemed to have reached the &s;ummit of his ambition; and the
German princes, who were a&s;toni&s;hed with his &s;ucce&s;s, were farther
di&s;|couraged by the intelligence, which they had received, of the death

the mo&s;t rigorous puni&s;h|ments again&s;t the reformers, brought matters to
a quick deci&s;ion. There was one Wi&s;hart, a gentleman by birth, who employed

great di&s;pute in the univer&s;ity of St. Andrews, whether the <HI>pater</HI>
&s;hould be &s;aid to God or the &s;aints. The friars, who knew in general that
the reformers neglected the &s;aints, were determined to maintain their honour
with great ob&s;tinacy, but they knew not upon what topics to found their
doctrine. Some held that the <HI>pater</HI> was &s;aid to God

with regard to tho&s;e e&s;timable qualities a&s;cribed to Wi&s;hart, he was
&s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a de&s;ire of innovation; and he enjoyed
tho&s;e talents, which qualified him for be|coming a popular preacher, and for
&s;eizing the attention and affections of the multitude. The magi&s;trates of
Dundee, where he exerci&s;ed his mi&s;&s;ion, were alarmed with his progre&s;s;
and being unable or unwilling to treat him with rigour, they contented
them&s;elves with denying him the liberty of preaching, and with
di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him the bounds of their juri&s;diction. Wi&s;hart, moved with
indig|nation, that they had dared to reject the word of God, menaced them, in
imita|tion of the antient prophets, with &s;ome imminent calamity; and he
withdrew to the we&s;t country, where he daily increa&s;ed the number of his
pro&s;elytes. Mean|while, a plague broke out in Dundee; and all men exclaimed,
that the town had drawn down the vengeance of Heaven by bani&s;hing the pious
preacher, and that the pe&s;tilence would never cea&s;e till they had made him

to them, and made them a new tender of his doctrine: But le&s;t he &s;hould
&s;pread the contagion by bringing multitudes together, he erected his pulpit
on the top of a gate: The infected &s;tood within; the others without. And the

<P>THE a&s;&s;iduity and &s;ucce&s;s of Wi&s;hart became an object
of attention to cardinal Beaton; and he re&s;olved, by the puni&s;hment of &s;o
celebrated a preacher, to &s;trike a terror into all other innovators. He
engaged the earl of Bothwel to arre&s;t him in his retirement; and to deliver
him into his hands, contrary to a promi&s;e given by Bothwel to that unhappy
man: And being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his prey, he conducted him to St. Andrew's
where, after a trial, he condemned him to the flames for here&s;y. Arran, the
regent, was very irre&s;olute in his temper; and the cardinal, tho' he had
gained him to his party, found, that he would not concur in the condemnation
and execution of Wi&s;hart. He was therefore determined, without the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;ecular arm, to bring that heretic to puni&s;hment;
and he him&s;elf beheld from his windows the di&s;mal &s;pectacle&punc;
Wi&s;hart &s;uffered with the u&s;ual patience; but could not forbear remarking
the triumph of his in&s;ulting enemy. He foretold, that in a few days he would

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of cardinal

formed a con&s;piracy again&s;t the cardinal; and having a&s;&s;ociated to them
Norman Le&s;ly, who was di&s;gu&s;ted on account of &s;ome private quarrel,
they conducted their enterprize with great &s;ecrecy and &s;ucce&s;s. Early in
the morning they entered the cardinal's palace, which he had &s;trongly
fortified; and though they were not above &s;ixteen per&s;ons, they thru&s;t
out an hundred trade&s;men and fifty &s;ervants, whom they &s;eized
&s;eparately, before any &s;u&s;picion aro&s;e of their intentions; and having
&s;hut the gates, they proceeded very deliberately to execute their purpo&s;e
on the car|dinal. That prelate had been alarmed with the noi&s;e which he heard
in the ca&s;tle; and had barricadoe'd the door of his chamber: But finding that
they had brought fire in order to force their way, and having obtained, as is
believed, a promi&s;e of life, he opened the door; and reminding them, that he
was a prie&s;t, be conjured them to &s;pare him. Two of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins
ru&s;hed upon him with drawn &s;words; but a third, James Melvil, more calm and
more con&s;iderate in <PB N="299" REF="304"> villany, &s;topped their carreer,
and reminded them, that this &s;acrifice was the work and judgment of God, and
ought to be executed with the utmo&s;t reflection and gravity. Then turning the
point of his &s;word towards Beaton, he called to him, 
<Q REND="inline">"Repent thee, thou wicked cardinal, of all thy

which now cries vengeance upon thee: We are &s;ent by God to inflict the

the 28th of May 1546. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins being reinforced by their friends

defence of the ca&s;tle, and &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to London, craving
a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Henry. That prince, tho' Scotland was comprehended in his
peace with France, would not re|ject this opportunity of di&s;turbing the
government of that kingdom; and he agreed to take them under his
protection.</P>
<P>IT was the peculiar misfortune of Scotland, that five &s;hort
reigns had been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively followed by as many long minorities; and the
execution of ju&s;tice, which the prince was beginning to introduce, had been
continually interrupted by the cabals, factions, and animo&s;ities of the
great. But be&s;ides the&s;e invete|rate and antient evils, a new &s;ource of
di&s;order had ari&s;en, the di&s;putes and con|tentions of theology, which
were &s;ufficient to di&s;turb the mo&s;t &s;ettled govern|ment; and the death
of the cardinal, who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ability and vigour, &s;eemed much
to weaken the hands of the admini&s;tration. But the Queen dow|ager was a woman
of uncommon talents and virtues; and &s;he did as much to &s;upport the
government, and &s;upply the weakne&s;s of Arran, the governor, as could be
expected in her &s;ituation. A &s;tipulation was made with the garri&s;on of
St. Andrews, that they &s;hould &s;urrender the ca&s;tle upon receiving a
pardon, to|gether with an ab&s;olution from the pope; and that they &s;hould
never afterwards <PB N="300" REF="305"> be called in que&s;tion for Beaton's

arrive, &s;he applied to France for &s;uccours; and Henry &s;ent her &s;ome
gallies, with a train of artillery, commanded by Strozzi, prior of Capua.
Be|fore the &s;iege of St. Andrews was opened, the ab&s;olution was &s;ent to

among other exagge|rations of the cardinal's murder, had &s;aid, that he

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the war with Scotland.</NOTE> THE
protector of England, &s;o &s;oon as the government was brought to &s;ome
compo&s;ure, made preparations for the attack of Scotland; and he was
determined to execute, if po&s;&s;ible, that project, of uniting the two
kingdoms by marriage, on which the late King had been &s;o intent, and which he
had recommended with his dying breath to his executors. He rai&s;ed an army of
18000 men, and equipped a fleet of &s;ixty &s;ail, one half of which were
&s;hips of war, the other loaded with provi&s;ions and ammunition. He gave the
command of the fleet to lord Clinton: He him&s;elf marched at the head of the
army, attended by the earl of Warwic. The&s;e ho&s;tile mea&s;ures were covered
with a pretence of revenging &s;ome depredations committed by the borderers;
but be&s;ides, that the protector revived the antient claim of the
&s;uperiority of the Engli&s;h crown over that of Scotland, he refu&s;ed to
enter into negotiation on any other conditions than the marriage of the young
Queen with Edward.</P>
<P>THE protector publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, in which he inforced
all the arguments for that mea&s;ure. He &s;aid, that nature &s;eemed
originally to have intended this i&s;land for one empire; and having cut it off
from all communication with foreign &s;tates, and guarded it by the ocean,
&s;he had pointed out to the inhabitants the road to happine&s;s and
&s;ecurity: That the education and cu&s;toms of the people concurred with
nature; and by giving them the &s;ame language, and laws, and manners, had
invited them to a thorough union and coalition: That fortune had at la&s;t
removed all ob&s;tacles, and had prepared an expedient, by which they might
be|come one people, without leaving any place for that jealou&s;y either of
honour or of intere&s;t, to which rival nations are naturally &s;o much
expo&s;ed: That the crown of Scotland had devolved to a female; that of England
to a male; and happily the two &s;overeigns, as of a rank, &s;o were they
al&s;o of an age, the mo&s;t &s;uitable <PB N="301" REF="306"> to each other:
That the ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition, which prevailed between the nations, and
which aro&s;e from pa&s;t injuries, would &s;oon be extingui&s;hed, after a
long and &s;ecure peace had e&s;tabli&s;hed confidence between them: That the
me|mory of former mi&s;eries, which at pre&s;ent enflamed their mutual
animo&s;ity, would then &s;erve only to make them cheri&s;h, with more
pa&s;&s;ion, a &s;tate of hap|pine&s;s and tranquillity, &s;o long unknown to
their ance&s;tors: That when ho&s;tilities had cea&s;ed between the kingdoms,
the Scotch nobility, who were at pre&s;ent obliged to remain perpetually in a
warlike po&s;ture, would learn to cultivate the arts of peace, and would
&s;often their minds to a love of dome&s;tic order and obe|dience: That as this
&s;ituation was de&s;irable to both kingdoms, &s;o particularly to Scotland,
which had been expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t mi&s;eries from inte&s;tine and
fo|reign wars, and &s;aw her&s;elf every moment in danger of lo&s;ing her
independency, by the efforts of a richer and more powerful people: That tho'
England had claims of &s;uperiority, &s;he was willing to re&s;ign every
preten&s;ion for the &s;ake of future peace, and de&s;ired an union, which
would be the more &s;ecure, as it would be concluded on terms entirely equal:
And that be&s;ides all the&s;e motives, po&s;itive engagements had been taken
for the compleating this alliance, and the honour and good faith of the nation
were pledged to fulfil what her intere&s;t and &s;afety &s;o loudly
demanded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir John Hayward in Kenneth, p. 279. Heylin,

con&s;train the Scotch by nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ubmit to a mea&s;ure, for which

<P>THE governor of Scotland had &s;ummoned together the whole force
of the kingdom; and his army, double the number of the Engli&s;h, had taken
po&s;t on very advantageous ground, guarded by the banks of the E&s;ke, about
four miles from Edinburgh. The Engli&s;h came within &s;ight of them at
Fa&s;ide; and after a &s;kirmi&s;h between the hor&s;e, where the Scotch were
wor&s;ted, and lord Hume dangerou&s;ly wounded, Somer&s;et prepared him&s;elf
for a more deci&s;ive action. But <PB N="302" REF="307"> having taken a view of
the Scotch camp with the earl of Warwic, he found it difficult to make any
attempt upon it with a probability of &s;ucce&s;s. He wrote therefore another
letter to Arran; and offered to retire out of the kingdom, as well as to repair
all damages which he had committed, provided that the Scotch would &s;tipulate
not to contract the Queen to any foreign prince, but to keep her at home, till
&s;he reached the age of choo&s;ing a hu&s;band for her&s;elf. Such mo|derate
terms were rejected by the Scotch merely on account of their moderation; and
begot an opinion, that the protector mu&s;t either be reduced to great
di&s;tre&s;s or be influenced by fear, that he was now contented to abate &s;o
much of his former preten&s;ions. Actuated al&s;o by their prie&s;ts, who had
come to the camp in great numbers, they believed, that the Engli&s;h were
dete&s;table heretics, abhorred of God, and expo&s;ed to divine vengeance; and
that no &s;ucce&s;s could ever crown their arms. They were confirmed in this
fond conceit, when they &s;aw the pro|tector change his ground, and move
towards the &s;ea; nor did they any longer doubt that he intended to embark his
army, and make his e&s;cape on board the &s;hips, which at that very time moved
into the bay, oppo&s;ite to him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p.

camp; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Septem|ber.</NOTE> and pa&s;&s;ing the
river E&s;ke, advanced into the plain. They were divided into three bodies:
Angus commanded the vanguard; Arran the main body; Huntley the rear: Their
cavalry con&s;i&s;ted only of light hor&s;e, which were placed on their left
flank, &s;trengthened by &s;ome Iri&s;h archers, whom Argyle had brought over
for this &s;ervice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The battle of Pinkey.</NOTE> SOMERSET was
plea&s;ed when he &s;aw this movement of the Scotch army; and as the Engli&s;h
had u&s;ually been &s;uperior in pitched battles, he conceived great hopes of
&s;ucce&s;s. He arranged his van on his left, farthe&s;t from the &s;ea; and
ordered them to remain on the high grounds on which he placed them, till the
enemy &s;hould approach: He placed his main battle and his rear towards the

and ordered him to take the Scotch van in &s;lank, but not till they &s;hould
be engaged in clo&s;e fight with the van of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>WHILE the Scotch were advancing on the plain, they were galled
with the artillery from the Engli&s;h &s;hips: The ma&s;ter of Graham was
killed: The Iri&s;h archers were thrown into di&s;order: and even the other
troops began to &s;tagger: When the lord Gray, perceiving their &s;ituation,
neglected his orders, left his ground, and at the head of his heavy-armed
hor&s;e made an attack on the Scotch infantry, in hopes of gaining all the
honour of the victory. On advancing, he <PB N="303" REF="308"> found a &s;lough
and ditch in his way; and behind were ranged the Scotch infantry armed with
&s;pears, and the field, on which they &s;tood, was fallow ground, broken with
ridges, which lay cro&s;s their front, and di&s;ordered the movements of the
Engli&s;h cavalry. From all the&s;e accidents, the &s;hock of this body of
hor&s;e was feeble and irregular; and as they were received on the points of
the Scotti&s;h &s;pears, which were longer than the lances of the Engli&s;h
hor&s;emen, they were in a moment pierced, overthrown, and di&s;comfited. Gray
him&s;elf was dangerou&s;ly wounded: Lord Edward Seymour, &s;on to the

ply the Scotch infantry with their &s;hot. They marched to the &s;lough, and
di&s;charged their pieces full in the face of the enemy: The &s;hips galled
them from the flank: The artillery, planted on a height, infe&s;ted them from
the front: The Engli&s;h archers poured in a &s;hower of arrows upon them: And
the vanguard, de&s;cending from the hill, ad|vanced, lei&s;urely and orderly,
towards them. Di&s;mayed with all the&s;e circum|&s;tances, the Scotch van
began to retreat: The retreat &s;oon changed into a flight; which was begun by
the Iri&s;h archers. The panic of the van communicated it&s;elf to the main
body, and pa&s;&s;ing thence to the rear, rendered the whole field a &s;cene of
confu&s;ion, terror, flight and con&s;ternation. The Engli&s;h army per|ceived
from the heights the condition of the Scotch, and began the pur&s;uit with loud
&s;houts and acclamations, which added &s;till more to the di&s;may of the
van|qui&s;hed. The hor&s;e in particular, eager to revenge the affront, which
they had received in the beginning of the day, committed the mo&s;t bloody
execution on the flying enemy; and from the field of battle to Edinburgh, for
the &s;pace of five miles, the whole ground was &s;trowed with dead bodies. The
prie&s;ts above all, and the monks received no quarter; and the Engli&s;h made
&s;port of &s;laugh|tering men, who, from their extreme zeal and animo&s;ity,
had engaged in an enterprize &s;o ill &s;uited to their profe&s;&s;ion. Few
victories have been more de|ci&s;ive, or gained with &s;maller lo&s;s to the
conquerors. There fell not two hun|dred of the Engli&s;h; and according to the
mo&s;t moderate computation, there <PB N="304" REF="309"> peri&s;hed above ten
thou&s;and of the Scotch. About fifteen hundred were taken pri&s;oners. This
action was called the Battle of Pinkey, from a nobleman's &s;eat of that name
in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>THE Queen dowager and Arran fled to Stirling, and were &s;carce
able to col|lect &s;uch a body of forces as could check the incur&s;ions of
&s;mall parties of the Engli&s;h. About the &s;ame time, the earl of Lenox and
lord Wharton entered the We&s;t Marches, at the head of five thou&s;and men,
and after taking and plun|dering Annan, they &s;pread deva&s;tation over all
the neighbouring counties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p.
992.</NOTE>. Had Somer&s;et pro&s;ecuted his advantage, he might have impo&s;ed
what terms he plea&s;ed on the Scotch nation: But he was impatient to return to
England, where he heard, &s;ome coun&s;ellors, and even his own brother, the
admiral, were carry|ing on cabals again&s;t his authority. Having taken the
ca&s;tles of Hume, Dun|gla&s;s, Eymouth, Fa&s;tca&s;tle, Roxborough, and &s;ome
other &s;mall places; and hav|ing received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome
counties on the borders, he retired out of Scotland. The fleet, be&s;ides
de&s;troying all the &s;hips along the coa&s;t, took Broughty in the Firth of
Tay, and having fortified it, they left there a garri&s;on. Arran de&s;ired
leave to &s;end commi&s;&s;ioners in order to treat of a peace; and
So|mer&s;et, having appointed Berwic for the place of meeting, left Warwic with
full powers to negociate: But no commi&s;&s;ioners from Scotland ever appeared.
The overture of the Scotch was an artifice, to gain time, till &s;uccours
&s;hould arrive from France.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Novemb.</NOTE> THE protector, on his

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> But if Somer&s;et gave
offence by a&s;&s;uming too much &s;tate, he de&s;erves the highe&s;t prai&s;e

former &s;tatutes was much mitigated, and &s;ome &s;ecurity given to the

None were to be accu&s;ed of words but within a month after they were &s;poken.
By the&s;e repeals &s;everal of the mo&s;t rigorous laws that ever were
pa&s;&s;ed in England, were an|nulled, and &s;ome dawnings, both of civil and
religious liberty, began to appear <PB N="305" REF="310"> to the people.
Here&s;y, however, was &s;till a capital crime by the common law, and was
&s;ubjected to the penalty of burning. There only remained no preci&s;e
&s;tandard by which that crime could be defined or determined: A circum&s;tance
which might either be advantageous or hurtful to public &s;ecurity, according
to the di&s;po&s;ition of the judges.</P>
<P>A REPEAL al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed of that law, the de&s;truction of all

<P>SOME &s;tatutes too were pa&s;&s;ed which were of the utmo&s;t

material con&s;equences to civil &s;ociety. The cup was re&s;tored to the
laity; private ma&s;&s;es were aboli&s;hed; the King was empowered to create
bi&s;hops by letters patent, without any &s;ham elec|tion of the chapter; the
bi&s;hops were ordered to i&s;&s;ue their writs, and hold their courts in the

<P>THE chantries and free chappels had been given by act of
parliament to the late King; and he had appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the reve|nues; but as they had not proceeded far in the
execution of their office, it was found nece&s;&s;ary to make a renewal of the
grant. The preamble to the &s;tatute promi&s;es, that the&s;e funds &s;hould be
employed to good and godly u&s;es, in erect|ing grammar &s;chools, in farther
augmenting the univer&s;ities, and in making better provi&s;ion for the poor

courtiers had already de|voured the prey in their imaginations; and it was not
long before it was &s;hared out among them.</P>
<P>IT was al&s;o enacted, that all who denied the King's
&s;upremacy, or a&s;&s;erted the pope's, &s;hould, for the fir&s;t offence,

if any, after the fir&s;t of March next, endeavoured, by writing, printing, or
any overt act or deed, to deprive the King of his e&s;tate or titles,
particularly of his &s;upremacy, or to confer them on any other, he was to be
adjudged guilty of trea&s;on. If any of the heirs of the crown &s;hould u&s;urp
upon another, or endeavour to break the <PB N="306" REF="311"> order of
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, it was declared trea&s;on in them, their aiders and abetters.
The&s;e were the mo&s;t con&s;iderable acts pa&s;&s;ed during this
&s;e&s;&s;ion. The members di&s;covered a very pa&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition with
regard to religion: Some few appeared zealous for the reformation: Others
harboured &s;ecretly a &s;trong inclination to the catholic faith: But the
greate&s;t part appeared willing to take any impre&s;&s;ion which they &s;hould
receive from intere&s;t, authority, or the reigning fa&s;hion<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heylin. p 48.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE convocation met at the &s;ame time with the Parliament; and
as it appear|ed, that their debates were at fir&s;t cramped by the rigour of
the &s;tatute of the &s;ix articles, the King granted them a di&s;pen&s;ation
from that law, before it was re|pealed by Parliament<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Britan. p. 339.</NOTE>. The lower hou&s;e of convocation
applied to have liberty of &s;itting with the commons in Parliament; or if this
privilege was refu&s;ed them, which they claimed as their ancient right, they
de&s;ired that no law regard|ing religion, might pa&s;s in Parliament without
their con&s;ent and approbation. But the principles which now prevailed, were
more advantageous to the civil than the eccle&s;ia&s;tical power; and tho'
there is rea&s;on to think, that the lower clergy &s;ent, during &s;ome time,
repre&s;entatives to the hou&s;e of commons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See
Atterbury's Rights, &amp;c. of an Engli&s;h convocation, p. 73.</NOTE>; yet
that practice had been aboli&s;hed for above two centuries; and the pre&s;ent
juncture was very little favourable for attempting to revive it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1548" UNIT="year"> THE protector had permitted
the repeal of that law, which gave to the King's proclamations the authority of
&s;tatutes; but he did not intend to renounce that arbitrary or di&s;cretionary
exerci&s;e of power, which had ever been a&s;&s;umed by the crown, and which it
is difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h exactly from the power of making laws. He even
continued to exert this authority in &s;ome particulars, which were regarded as
the mo&s;t momentuous. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Farther pro|gre&s;s of the reformation.</NOTE>
Orders were i&s;&s;ued by council, that candles &s;hould no longer be carried
about on Candlemas-day, a&s;hes on A&s;h-wedne&s;day, palmes on
Palm-&s;unday<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 59. Collier,

practices, now deno|minated &s;uper&s;titions; tho' it is very fortunate for
mankind, when &s;uper&s;tition hap|pens to take a direction &s;o innocent and
inoffen&s;ive. The &s;evere di&s;po&s;ition which naturally attends all
reformers, prompted likewi&s;e the council to aboli&s;h &s;ome gay and &s;howy
ceremonies, which belonged to the ancient religion<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN order was al&s;o i&s;&s;ued by the council for the removal of
all images from the churches: An innovation which was much de&s;ired by all the
reformers, and which alone, with regard to the populace, amounted almo&s;t to a
total change of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 60. Collier, vol. II. p. 241.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> p
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>. An attempt had been made
to &s;eparate the u&s;e of images <PB N="307" REF="312"> from their abu&s;e,
the reverence from the wor&s;hip of them; but the execu|tion of this de&s;ign
was found, upon trial, very difficult, if not wholly imprac|ticable.</P>
<P>AS private ma&s;&s;es were aboli&s;hed by law, it became
nece&s;&s;ary to frame a new communion-office; and the council went &s;o far,
in the preface which they had prefixed to this work, as to leave the practice
of auricular confe&s;&s;ion wholly in|different<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. This was a prelude to the entire abolition of that
invention, one of the mo&s;t powerful engines that ever was contrived for
degrading the laity, and giving their &s;piritual guides an entire a&s;cendant
over them. And it may ju&s;tly be &s;aid, that tho' the prie&s;t's
ab&s;olution, which attends confe&s;&s;ion, &s;erves &s;omewhat to ea&s;e weak
minds from the immediate agonies of &s;uper&s;titious terror, it operates only
by &s;trongly enforcing &s;uper&s;tition it&s;elf, and thereby preparing the
mind for a more violent relap&s;e into the &s;ame di&s;orders.</P>
<P>THE people were at that time extremely di&s;tracted, by the
oppo&s;ite opinions of their preachers; and as they were totally incapable to
judge of the rea&s;ons ad|vanced on either &s;ide, and naturally regarded every
thing which they heard at church, as of equal authority, a great confu&s;ion
and fluctuation re&s;ulted from this uncertainty. The council fir&s;t
endeavoured to remedy that inconvenience, by lay|ing &s;ome re&s;traints on
preaching; but finding this expedient ineffectual, they im|po&s;ed a total
&s;ilence on the preachers, and thus put an end at once to all the po|lemics of
the pulpit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuller, Heylin, Burnet.</NOTE>. By the
nature of things, this re&s;traint could only be temporary. For in proportion
as the ceremonies of public wor&s;hip, its &s;hows and exterior ob&s;ervances,
were retrenched by the reformers, the people were in|clined to contract a
&s;tronger attachment to &s;ermons, whence alone they received any occupation
or amu&s;ement. The ancient religion, by giving its votaries &s;ome|thing to
do, freed them from the trouble of knowing: Sermons were only deli|vered in the
principal churches, and at &s;ome particular fa&s;ts and fe&s;tivals: And the
practice of haranguing the populace, which, if abu&s;ed, is &s;o powerful an
incitement to faction and &s;edition, had much le&s;s &s;cope and influence
during tho&s;e ages.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affair of Scotland.</NOTE> THE greater
progre&s;s was made towards a reformation in England, the further did the
protector find him&s;elf from all pro&s;pect of compleating the union with
Scotland; and the Queen-dowager, as well as the clergy, became the more
aver&s;e to all alliance with a nation which had departed &s;o far from all
ancient principles. Somer&s;et, having taken the town of Haddington, had
ordered it to be &s;trongly garri&s;oned and fortified, by lord Gray: He al&s;o
erected &s;ome &s;ortifica|tions <PB N="308" REF="313"> at Lauder: And he
hoped, that the&s;e two places, together with Broughty and &s;ome &s;maller
for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;&s;es, which were in the
hands of the Engli&s;h, would &s;erve as a curb to Scotland; and would give him
acce&s;s into the heart of the country.</P>
<P>ARRAN, being di&s;appointed in &s;ome attempts on Broughty,
relied chiefly on the &s;uceours expected from France, for the recovery of
the&s;e places; and they ar|rived at la&s;t in the Firth, to the number of
&s;ix thou&s;and men; one half of whom were Germans. They were commanded by
De&s;&s;&eacute;, and under him by Andelot, Strozzi, Meilleraye, count
Rhingrave. The Scotch were at that time &s;o &s;unk by their misfortunes, that
five hundred Engli&s;h hor&s;e were able to ravage the whole country without
re&s;i&s;tance; and make inroads to the gates of the ca|pital<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Beagu&eacute;, hi&s;t. of the Campagnes, 1548 and 1549, p.
6.</NOTE>: But on the appearance of the French &s;uccours, they collected more
courage; and having joined De&s;&s;&eacute; with a con&s;iderable
reinforcement, they laid &s;iege to Haddington<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 993.</NOTE>. This was an undertaking for which
they were them&s;elves totally unfit; being only practi&s;ed in a kind of
de&s;ultory war, where they &s;erved without pay, and with a few weeks
provi&s;ions, which they brought along with them. Even with the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the French, they placed their chief hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in
&s;tarving the garri&s;on; and after &s;ome vain attempts to take the place by
a regular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">iege, the blockade of
Haddington was formed. The garri&s;on were re|pul&s;ed with lo&s;s in &s;everal
&s;allies which they made upon the be&s;iegers.</P>
<P>THE ho&s;tile attempts which the late King and the protector had
made again&s;t Scotland, not being &s;teedy, regular, nor pu&s;hed to the
la&s;t extremity, had &s;erved only to irritate the nation, and to in&s;pire
them with the &s;tronge&s;t aver&s;ion to that confederacy which was courted in
&s;o violent a manner. Even tho&s;e who were inclined to the Engli&s;h
alliance, were di&s;plea&s;ed to have it impo&s;ed on them by force of arms;
and the earl of Huntley in particular, &s;aid plea&s;antly, that he di&s;liked
not the match, but he hated the manner of wooing<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 46. Patten.</NOTE>. The Queen|dowager, finding the&s;e
&s;entiments to prevail, called a Parliament, in an abbey near Haddington; and
it was there propo&s;ed, that the young Queen, for her greater &s;ecurity,
&s;hould be &s;ent to France, and be committed to the protection of that
ancient ally. Some objected, that this mea&s;ure was de&s;perate, allowed no
re&s;ource in ca&s;e of mi&s;carriage, expo&s;ed the Scotch to be &s;ubjected
by foreigners, involved them in perpetual war with England, and left them no
expedient by which they could conciliate the friend&s;hip of that powerful
nation. It was an|&s;wered, on the other hand, that the Queen's pre&s;ence was
the very cau&s;e of war with England; that that nation would de&s;i&s;t when
they found that their views <PB N="309" REF="314"> of forcing a marriage had
become altogether impracticable; and that Henry, being engaged by &s;o high a
mark of confidence, would take their &s;overeign un|der his guardian&s;hip, and
u&s;e his utmo&s;t efforts to defend the kingdom. The&s;e arguments were aided
by French gold, which was plentifully di&s;tributed among the nobles. The
governor had a pen&s;ion conferred on him of twelve thou&s;and livres a year,
received the title of duke of Chatelrault, and obtained for his &s;on the
command of an hundred men at arms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p.
83. Buchan. lib. XV. Keith, p. 55. Thuanus, lib. V. c. 15.</NOTE>. And as all
the clergy dreaded the con&s;equences of the Engli&s;h alliance, they
&s;econded this mea&s;ure with all the zeal and indu&s;try which either
principles or intere&s;t could in&s;pire. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Young Queen of Scots &s;ent into

<P>SOMERSET, pre&s;&s;ed by many difficulties at home, and
de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s in his enterprize again&s;t Scotland, was
de&s;irous of compo&s;ing the differences with that kingdom, and he offered the
Scotch a ten years truce; but as they in&s;i&s;ted on his re&s;toring all the
places which he had taken, the propo&s;al came to nothing. The Scotch took the
fortre&s;&s;es of Hume and Fa&s;t-ca&s;tle, by &s;urprize, and put the
garri&s;on to the &s;word: They repul&s;ed, with lo&s;s, the Engli&s;h, who,
under the command of lord Seymour, made a de&s;cent, fir&s;t in Fife, and then
at Mon|tro&s;e: In the former action, James Stuart, natural brother to the
Queen, ac|quired great honour; in the &s;econd action, Are&s;kine of Dun. An
attempt was made by Sir Robert Bowes and Sir Thomas Palmer, at the head of a
con&s;iderable body, to throw relief into Haddington; but the&s;e troops
falling into an ambu&s;cade, were almo&s;t wholly cut in pieces<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 595. Holling&s;hed, p. 994.</NOTE>. And
tho' a &s;mall body of two hundred men e&s;caped all the vigilance of the
French, and arrived &s;afely in Haddington, with &s;ome ammunition and
provi&s;ions, the garri&s;on was reduced to &s;uch difficulties, that the
protector found it nece&s;&s;ary to provide more effectu|ally for their relief.
He rai&s;ed an army of eighteen thou&s;and men, and adding three thou&s;and
Germans, who, on the di&s;&s;olution of the prote&s;tant alliance, had offered 
<PB N="310" REF="315"> their &s;ervice to England, he gave the command of the
whole to the earl of Shrew&s;bury<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p.

Engli&s;h; and with great difficulty made good his retreat to Edinburgh, where
he po&s;ted him&s;elf advantageou&s;ly. Shrew&s;bury, who had lo&s;t the
opportunity of attack|ing him on his march, dur&s;t not give him battle in his
pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and contenting him&s;elf with the advantage already
gained of &s;upplying Haddington, he retired into England.</P>
<P>DURING the abode of the French troops many complaints had
ari&s;en between them and the Scotch; and a &s;mall accident<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Beaagu&eacute;, p. 68. Knox, p. 81.</NOTE>having excited a tumult
in Edin|burgh, the provo&s;t and his &s;on were unfortunately killed by the
French &s;oldiers. This event increa&s;ed the animo&s;ity between the two
nations: But D'E&s;&s;e, in order to make atonement for that act of violence,
led his troops ha&s;tily to Haddington, and in the night-time attempted to
&s;urprize the town. He found the garri&s;on un|prepared to re&s;i&s;t him; and
had already entered the outer court: But a French de&s;erter firing a cannon,
which pointed towards the gates, the &s;hot fell among the thicke&s;t of the
enemy, and made &s;uch havoc as threw the whole into confu&s;ion, and enabled
the Engli&s;h to repul&s;e them. It is pretended, that no le&s;s than a hundred
per&s;ons fell by this &s;ingle &s;hot.</P>
<P>THE French general was a man of ability and experience; but as
he had not the good fortune to be acceptable to the Scotch nation, it was
thought proper to recall him, and to &s;end over De Thermes in his place.
D'E&s;&s;&eacute;, before his de|parture, fortified Leith, which, from a
&s;mall village, &s;oon became a con&s;iderable town, by the concour&s;e of
inhabitants, who found there a &s;ecurity, which they could no where el&s;e
enjoy in Scotland. He al&s;o attacked an Engli&s;h garri&s;on in Inch-keith, an
i&s;land oppo&s;ite to that harbour, and made them pri&s;oners. After the&s;e
exploits, he re&s;igned his command to De Thermes, who brought over with him
Monluc, bi&s;hop of Valence, a man celebrated for wi&s;dom and capacity. This
prelate was named chancellor of the kingdom; and it was probably intend|ed, by
his means, to in&s;pire the nation with &s;ome greater attachment to the
prin|ciples of law and equity: But the Scotch, impatient of re&s;traint, and

<P>THO' the protection of France was of great con&s;equence to the
Scotch, in &s;up|porting them again&s;t the inva&s;ions of England, they reaped
&s;till more benefit from the di&s;tractions and divi&s;ions which had crept
into the councils of that latter <PB N="311" REF="316"> kingdom. Even the two
brothers, the protector and admiral, not contented with the high &s;tations
which they &s;everally enjoyed, and the great eminence to which they had
ri&s;en, had entertained the mo&s;t violent jealou&s;y of each other's
authority; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabals of lord Seymour.</NOTE> and they
divided the whole court and kingdom, by their oppo&s;ite cabals and
pre|ten&s;ions. Lord Seymour was a man of in&s;atiable ambition, arrogant,
a&s;&s;uming, implacable; and tho' e&s;teemed of &s;uperior capacity to the
protector, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not to the &s;ame degree the confidence and
regard of the people. By his flattery and addre&s;s, he had &s;o in&s;inuated
him&s;elf into the good graces of the Queen|dowager, that, forgetting her
u&s;ual prudence and decency, &s;he married him im|mediately upon the decea&s;e
of the late King: In&s;omuch, that, had &s;he &s;oon proved pregnant, it might
have been doubtful to which hu&s;band the child be|longed. The credit and
riches of this alliance &s;upported the ambition of the admiral; but gave
umbrage to the dutche&s;s of Somer&s;et, who, unea&s;y that the younger
brother's wife &s;hould have the precedency, employed all her intere&s;t with
her hu&s;band, which was too great, fir&s;t to create, and then to widen a
breach between the two brothers<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 301.

<P>THE fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of this mi&s;under&s;tanding appeared
when the protector commanded the army in Scotland. The &s;ecretary, Paget, a
man entirely devoted to Somer&s;et, remarked, that Seymour was forming
&s;eparate intrigues among the coun&s;ellors; was corrupting, by pre&s;ents,
the King's &s;ervants; and even endeavouring, by improper indulgencies and
liberalities, to captivate the affections of the young monarch. Paget
repre&s;ented to him the danger of this conduct; de&s;ired him to reflect on
the numerous enemies whom the &s;udden elevation of their family had created;
and warned him that any di&s;|&s;en&s;ion between him and the protector, would
be greedily laid hold of, to draw on the ruin of both. Finding his
remon&s;trances ineffectual, he convey|ed intelligence of the danger to
Somer&s;et, and engaged him to leave the enter|prize again&s;t Scotland
unfini&s;hed, in order to guard again&s;t the attempts of his dome&s;tic
enemies. In the en&s;uing Parliament, the admiral's projects appeared &s;till
more hazardous to public tranquillity; and as he had acquired many partizans
and retainers, he made a direct attack upon his brother's autho|rity. He
repre&s;ented to his friends, that formerly, during a minority, the office of
protector of the kingdom had been kept &s;eparate from that of governor of the
king's per&s;on; and that the pre&s;ent union of the&s;e two important
tru&s;ts, con&s;erred on Somer&s;et an authority which could not &s;afely be
lodged in any &s;ub|ject<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, 90.</NOTE>. He even prevailed on the
young King, to write a letter to the Parlia|ment, <PB N="312" REF="317">
de&s;iring that Seymour might be appointed his governor; and he had formed a
party in the two hou&s;es, by which he hoped to have effected his pur|po&s;e.
The de&s;ign was di&s;covered before its execution; and &s;ome common friends
were &s;ent to remon&s;trate with him, but had &s;o little influence, that he
threw out many menacing expre&s;&s;ions, and ra&s;hly threatened, that, if he
was thwarted in his attempt, he would make this Parliament the blacke&s;t that
ever was in Eng|land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 75.</NOTE>. The council
&s;ent for him, to an&s;wer for his conduct; but he refu&s;ed to attend: They
then began to threaten in their turn, and informed him, that the King's letter,
in&s;tead of availing him any thing to the execution of his pur|po&s;e, would
be imputed to him as a criminal enterprize, and be con&s;trued a de|&s;ign to
di&s;turb the government, by forming a &s;eparate intere&s;t with a child and
minor. They even let fall &s;ome menaces of &s;ending him to the Tower for his
temerity; and the admiral finding him&s;elf prevented in his de&s;ign, was
ob|liged to &s;ubmit, and to de&s;ire a reconcilement with his brother.</P>
<P>THE mild and moderate temper of Somer&s;et made him willing to
forget the&s;e enterprizes of the admiral; but the ambition of that turbulent
&s;pirit could not be &s;o ea&s;ily appea&s;ed. His &s;pou&s;e, the
Queen-dowager, died in child-bed; but &s;o far from regarding this event as a
check to his a&s;piring views, he founded on it the &s;cheme of a more
extraordinary elevation. He made his addre&s;&s;es to the lady Elizabeth, then
in the &s;ixteenth year of her age; and that prince&s;s, whom even the hurry of
bu&s;ine&s;s, and the pur&s;uits of ambition, could not, in her more advanced
years, di&s;engage entirely from the tender pa&s;&s;ions, &s;eems to have
li&s;tened to the in&s;inuations of a man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every talent
proper to captivate the affections of the fair<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">bid. 95, 96, 107,
108.</NOTE>. But as Henry the eighth had excluded his daughters from all hopes
of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, if they married without the con&s;ent of his executors,
which Seymour could never hope to obtain; it was concluded, that he propo&s;ed
to effectuate his purpo&s;e by expedients &s;till more ra&s;h and more
criminal. All the other mea&s;ures of the admiral tended to confirm this
&s;u&s;picion. He continued to attack, by pre&s;ents, the fidelity of all
tho&s;e who had more imme|diate acce&s;s to the King's per&s;on: He endeavoured
to &s;educe that young prince into his intere&s;t: He found means of holding a
private corre&s;pondence with him: He publicly decried his brother's
admini&s;tration; and a&s;&s;erted, that by enli&s;ting Germans, and other
foreigners, he intended to form a mercenary army, which endangered the King's
aughority, and the liberty of the people: By promi&s;es and per&s;ua&s;ion he
brought over to his party many of the principal nobility; and had di&s;tributed
his intere&s;t all over England: He neglected not even the mo&s;t 
<PB N="313" REF="318"> popular per&s;ons of inferior rank; and had computed,
that he could, on occa&s;ion, command the &s;ervice of ten thou&s;and men,
among his &s;ervants, tenants, and re|tainers<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 105, 106.</NOTE>: He had already provided arms for
their u&s;e; and having engaged in his intere&s;ts Sir John Sharington, a very
corrupt man, ma&s;ter of the mint at Bri&s;tol, he flattered him&s;elf that
money would not be wanting. Somer&s;et was well informed of all the&s;e
alarming circum&s;tances, and endeavoured by the mo&s;t friendly expedients, by
intreaty, rea&s;on, and even by heaping new favours upon him, to make him
depart from his precipitant councils: But finding all his en|deavours
ineffectual, he began to think of more &s;evere remedies. The earl of Warwic
was an ill in&s;trument between the brothers; and had formed the de&s;ign, by
inflaming the quarrel, to rai&s;e his own fortune on both their ruins.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dudley, earl of Warwic.</NOTE> DUDLEY, earl
of Warwic, was the &s;on of that Dudley, mini&s;ter to Henry the &s;eventh, who
having, by rapine, extortion, and perver&s;ion of law, incurred the hatred of
the public, had been &s;acrificed to popular animo&s;ity, in the be|ginning of
the &s;ub&s;equent reign. The late King, &s;en&s;ible of the iniquity, at
lea&s;t illegality of the &s;entence, had afterwards re&s;tored young Dudley's
blood by act of parliament; and finding him endowed with ability, indu&s;try,
and enter|prize, he had entru&s;ted him with many important commands, and had
ever found him &s;ucce&s;sful in all his undertakings. He rai&s;ed him to the
dignity of vi&s;count Li&s;le, conferred on him the office of admiral, and gave
him by his will a place among his executors. Dudley made &s;till farther
progre&s;s during the mi|nority; and having obtained the title of earl of
Warwic, and undermined the credit of Southampton, he bore the fir&s;t rank
among the protector's coun&s;ellors. The victory, gained at Pinkey, was much
a&s;cribed to his courage and conduct; and he was univer&s;ally regarded as a
man equally endowed with the talents of peace and war. But all the&s;e virtues
were ob&s;cured by &s;till greater vices; an exorbitant ambition, an
in&s;atiable avarice, a neglect of decency, a contempt of ju&s;tice: And as he
found, that lord Seymour, who&s;e ability and enterprize he chiefly dreaded,
was involving him&s;elf in ruin, by his ra&s;h councils, he was determined to
pu&s;h him to the precipice; and thereby remove the chief ob&s;tacle to his own
projected greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN Somer&s;et found that the public peace was expo&s;ed by his
brother's &s;edi|tious, if not rebellious, &s;chemes, he was the more ea&s;ily
per&s;uaded, by Warwic, to employ the extent of royal authority again&s;t him;
and after depriving him of the office of admiral, he &s;igned a warrant for
committing him to the Tower. Some of his accomplices were al&s;o taken into
cu&s;tody; and three privy coun&s;ellors, being &s;ent to examine them, made a
report, that they had met with very full <PB N="314" REF="319"> and important
di&s;coveries. Yet &s;till the protector &s;u&s;pended the blow, and &s;howed a
reluctance to ruin his brother. He offered to depart from the pro&s;ecu|tion,
if Seymour would promi&s;e him a cordial reconcilement; and relinqui&s;hing all
ambitious hopes, be contented with a private life, and retire into the country.
But as Seymour made no other an&s;wer to the&s;e friendly offers than menaces
and defiances, he ordered a charge to be drawn up again&s;t him, con&s;i&s;ting
of thirty-three articles<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. Coll.
31. 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. c. 18.</NOTE>; and the whole to be laid before the
privy-council. It is pre|tended, that every particular was &s;o inconte&s;tibly
proved, both by witne&s;&s;es and his own hand-writing, that there was no room
for doubt; yet did the council think proper to go in a body to the Tower, in
order more fully to examine the pri&s;oner. He was not daunted by the
appearance; but boldly demanded a fair trial; required to be confronted with
the witne&s;&s;es; de&s;ired that the charge might be left with him, in order
to be con&s;idered; and refu&s;ed to an&s;wer any interroga|tories, by which he
might en&s;nare him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT is apparent, that notwith&s;tanding what is pretended, there
mu&s;t have been &s;ome deficiency in the evidence again&s;t Seymour, when
&s;uch demands, founded on the plaine&s;t principles of law and equity, were
ab&s;olutely rejected. We &s;hall indeed conclude, if we carefully examine the
charge, that many of the articles were general, and &s;carce capable of any
proof; many of them, if true, &s;u&s;|ceptible of a more favourable
interpretation; and that, tho' on the whole, Sey|mour appears to have been a
very dangerous &s;ubject, yet he had not advanced far in tho&s;e trea&s;onable
projects imputed to him. The chief part of his guilt &s;eems to have
con&s;i&s;ted in &s;ome unwarrantable practices in the admiralty, by which
pyrates were protected, and illegal impo&s;itions laid upon the merchants.</P>
<P>BUT the admini&s;tration had, at that time, an ea&s;y
in&s;trument of vengeance, to wit, the Parliament; and needed not give
them&s;elves any concern with regard either to the guilt of the per&s;ons whom
they pro&s;ecuted, or the evidence which could be produced again&s;t them. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Novem|ber.</NOTE> A &s;e&s;&s;ion of
Parliament being held, it was propo&s;ed to proceed again&s;t Seymour by bill
of attainder; and much per&s;ua&s;ion being employed to engage the young King
to con&s;ent to it, a con&s;iderable weight was put on his approbation.
<MILESTONE N="1549" UNIT="year"> The matter was fir&s;t laid before the upper
hou&s;e; and &s;everal peers, ri&s;ing up in their places, gave an account of
what they knew concerning lord Seymour's conduct, and his criminal words or
actions. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attainder of lord Seymour.</NOTE> The&s;e
narratives were received for undoubted evidence; and tho' the pri&s;oner had
for|merly engaged many friends and partizans among the nobility, no one had
either the courage or equity to move, that he might be heard in his own
defence, that the te&s;timony again&s;t him &s;hould be delivered in a legal
manner, and that he <PB N="315" REF="320"> &s;hould be confronted with the
witne&s;&s;es. A little more &s;cruple was made in the hou&s;e of commons:
There were even &s;ome members who objected again&s;t the whole method of
proceeding by bills of attainder, pa&s;&s;ed in ab&s;ence; and required, that a
formal trial &s;hould be given to every man before his condemnation. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th March.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His execu|tion.</NOTE> But upon receiving a
me&s;&s;age from the King, requiring them to proceed, and offering that the
&s;ame narratives &s;hould be laid before them which had &s;atisfied the peers,
they were ea&s;ily prevailed on to acquie&s;ce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 &amp;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Edw. VI. c. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. The bill pa&s;&s;ed in a very
full hou&s;e. Near four hundred voted for it; and not above nine or ten
again&s;t it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> vol II. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE>. The &s;entence was &s;oon after executed, and the
pri&s;oner was beheaded on Tower|hill. The warrant was &s;igned by Somer&s;et,
who was expo&s;ed to much blame, on account of the violence of the&s;e
proceedings. The attempts of the admiral &s;eemed chiefly to be levelled
again&s;t his brother's u&s;urped authority; and tho' his ambitious,
enterprizing character, encouraged by a marriage with the lady Eli|zabeth,
might have proved dangerous to public tranquillity, the prudence of
fore&s;eeing dangers at &s;uch a di&s;tance, was e&s;teemed too great, and the
remedy was plainly illegal. It could only be &s;aid, that this bill of
attainder was &s;ome|what more tolerable than the preceding ones, to which the
nation had been ac|cu&s;tomed. For here, at lea&s;t, &s;ome &s;hadow of
evidence was produced.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs.</NOTE> ALL the
other con&s;iderable bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;acted this &s;e&s;&s;ion, be&s;ides
the attainder of lord Seymour, regarded eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters; which were
now the chief concern of the nation. A committee of bi&s;hops and divines had
been appointed by the council, to frame a liturgy for the &s;ervice of the
church; and they had executed the work committed to them. They proceeded with
great moderation in this delicate undertaking: They retained as much of the
ancient ma&s;s as the principles of the reformers would permit: They indulged
nothing to the &s;pirit of contradiction, which &s;o naturally takes place in
all great innovations: And they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lattered them&s;elves, that they had framed a &s;ervice, in which
every denomination of Chri&s;tians might, without &s;cruple, concur. The ma&s;s
had been always celebrat|ed in Latin; a practice which might have been
e&s;teemed ab&s;urd, had it not been found u&s;eful to the clergy, by
impre&s;&s;ing the people with an idea of &s;ome my&s;te|rious unknown virtue
in tho&s;e rites, and by checking all their preten&s;ions to be familiarly
acquainted with their religion. But as the reformers pretended in &s;ome few
particulars to encourage private judgment in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ity, the tran&s;lation of the
liturgy, as well as of the &s;criptures, into the vulgar tongue, &s;eemed more
con|formable to the genius of their &s;ect; and this innovation, with the
retrenchment of prayers to &s;aints, and of &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious
ceremonies, was the chief differ|ence <PB N="316" REF="321"> between the old
ma&s;s and the new liturgy. The Parliament e&s;tabli&s;hed this form of
wor&s;hip in all the churches, and ordered an uniformity to be ob|&s;erved in
all the rites and ceremonies<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI.
cap. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE was another very material act, which pa&s;&s;ed this
&s;e&s;&s;ion. The former canons had e&s;tabli&s;hed the celibacy of the
clergy; and though this practice be u&s;ually a&s;cribed to the policy of the
court of Rome, who thought, that the eccle|&s;ia&s;tics would be more devoted
to their &s;piritual head, and le&s;s dependant on the civil magi&s;trate, when
freed from the powerful tyes of wives and children; yet was this in&s;titution
much forwarded by the principles of &s;uper&s;tition inherent in human nature.
The&s;e principles had rendered the panegyrics of an inviolate cha&s;tity &s;o
frequent among the antient fathers, long before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of
celibacy. And even the Engli&s;h parliament, though they framed a law,
permitting the marriages of prie&s;ts, yet confe&s;s, in the preamble, 
<Q REND="inline">"that it were better for prie&s;ts and the
mini&s;ters of the church to live cha&s;te and without marriage, and it were
much to be wi&s;hed they would of them&s;elves ab&s;tain."</Q> The
inconveni|ences, which had ari&s;en from compelling cha&s;tity and prohibiting
marriage, are the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for indulging a liberty in this
particular<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 21.</NOTE>.
The ideas of pen|nance al&s;o were &s;o much retained in other particulars,
that an act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed, prohibiting the u&s;e of fle&s;h, during
Lent and the other times of ab&s;ti|nence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 19. Another act, pa&s;&s;ed this
&s;e&s;&s;ion, takes notice in the preamble, that the city of York, formerly
well inhabited, was now much decayed: In&s;omuch that many of the cures could
not afford a competent maintenance to the incumbents. To remedy this
inconvenience, the magi&s;trates were empowered to unite as many pari&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> as they thought proper. An
eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;torian, Collier, vol. ii. p. 230, thinks, that this
decay of York is chiefly to be a&s;cribed to the di&s;&s;olution of
mona&s;teries, by which the revenues fell into the hands of per&s;ons who lived
at a di&s;tance.</P> 
<P>A very grievous tax was impo&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion upon
the whole &s;tock and monied intere&s;t of the king|dom, and even upon its
indu&s;try. It was a &s;hilling in the pound yearly, during three years, on
every per&s;on worth ten pounds or upwards: The double on aliens and denizons.
The&s;e la&s;t, if above twelve years of age, and if worth le&s;s than twenty
&s;hillings, were to pay eight pence yearly. Every wether was to pay two pence
yearly; every ewe three pence. The woolen manufacturers were to pay eight pence
a pound on the value of all the cloth they made. The&s;e exorbitant taxes on
money are a proof, that few people lived on the money lent out at intere&s;t:
For this tax amounts to the half of the yearly income of all money-holders,
during three years, e&s;timating their intere&s;t at the rate allowed by law;
and was too grievous to be born, if many per&s;ons had been affected by it. It
is remarkable, that no tax at all was laid upon land this &s;e&s;&s;ion. The
profits of merchandi&s;e were commonly &s;o high, that it was &s;uppo&s;ed it
could bear this impo&s;ition. The mo&s;t ab&s;urd part of the law &s;eems to be
the tax upon the woolen manufacture. See 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 36. The
&s;ub&s;equent Parliament repealed the tax on &s;heep and woolen cloth. 3 &amp;
4 Edw. VI. cap. 23. But they continued the other tax a year longer. Ibid.</P> 
<P>The clergy taxed them&s;elves at &s;ix &s;hillings in the
pound to be paid in three years. This taxation was ratified in Parliament,
which had been the common practice &s;ince the reformation, as if the clergy
had no legi&s;lative power, even over them&s;elves. See 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap.
35.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="322"> THE principal tenets and practices of the
catholic religion were now aboli&s;hed, and the reformation, &s;uch as we enjoy
it at pre&s;ent, was almo&s;t entirely compleated in England. But the doctrine
of the real pre&s;ence, though tacitly condemned by the new communion-&s;ervice
and by the prohibition of many antient rites, &s;till retained &s;ome hold of
the minds of men; and it was the la&s;t doctrine of popery, which was wholly
abandoned by the people<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. cap.
104.</NOTE>. The extreme attachment of the late King to that tenet might be
&s;ome ground for this ob&s;tinacy; but the chief cau&s;e was really the
extreme ab&s;urdity of the principle it&s;elf, and the profound vene|ration,
which of cour&s;e it impre&s;&s;ed on the under&s;tanding. The prie&s;ts
likewi&s;e were much inclined to favour an opinion, which attributed to them
&s;o miracu|lous a power; and the people, who believed that they participated
of the very body and blood of their Saviour, were loth to renounce &s;o
extraordinary, and as they imagined, &s;o &s;alutary a privilege. The general
attachment to this dogma was &s;o violent, that the Lutherans,
notwith&s;tanding their &s;eparation from Rome, had thought proper, under
another name, &s;till to retain it: And the catholic preachers, in England,
when re&s;trained in every other particular, could not forbear, on every
occa&s;ion, from inculcating that tenet. Bonner, for this offence among others,
had been tried by the council, had been deprived of his &s;ee, and had been
committed to cu&s;tody. Gardiner al&s;o, who had recovered his liberty,
appeared anew refractory to the authority, which e&s;tabli&s;hed the late
innovations; and he &s;eemed willing to countenance that opinion, much favoured
by all the Engli&s;h catholics, that the King was indeed &s;upreme head of the
church, but not the council, during a minority. Having declined giving full
&s;ati&s;|faction on this head, he was &s;ent to the Tower, and threatened with
farther effects of the council's di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THESE &s;everities, being exerci&s;ed again&s;t men,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of office and autho|rity, &s;eemed a nece&s;&s;ary policy, in
order to inforce an uniformity in public wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline: But there
were other in&s;tances of per&s;ecution, which were derived from no other
origin than the bigotry of theologians; a malady, which &s;eems almo&s;t
incurable. Tho' the prote&s;tant divines had ventured to renounce opinions,
deemed certain during &s;o many centuries, they regarded, in their turn, the
new &s;y&s;tem as &s;o certain, that they could bear no contradiction 
<PB N="318" REF="323"> with regard to it; and they were ready to burn in the
&s;ame flames, from which they them&s;elves had &s;o narrowly e&s;caped, every
one who had the a&s;&s;urance to oppo&s;e them. A commi&s;&s;ion by act of
council was granted to the primate and &s;ome others, to examine and &s;earch
after all anabapti&s;ts, heretics, or contemners of the book of common
prayer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">
III. Rymer, tom. XV. p. 181.</NOTE>. They were enjoined to reclaim them, if
po&s;&s;ible; to impo&s;e pennance on them; and to give them ab&s;olution: Or
if they were ob&s;tinate, to excommunicate and impri&s;on them, and to deliver
them over to the &s;ecular arm: And in the execution of this charge, the
commi&s;&s;ioners were not bound to ob&s;erve the ordinary methods of trial;
the forms of law were di&s;pen&s;ed with, and if any &s;tatutes happened to
interfere with the powers in the commi&s;&s;ion, they were over-ruled and
abrogated by the council. Some trade&s;men in London were brought before
the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, and were accu&s;ed of maintaining, among other
opinions, that a man regenerate could not &s;in, and that though the outward
man might offend, the inward was incapable of all guilt. They were prevailed on
to abjure and were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. But there was a woman accu&s;ed of
heretical pravity, called Joan Bocher, or Joan of Kent, who was &s;o extremely
ob&s;tinate, that the commi&s;&s;ioners could gain nothing upon her. Her
doctrine was, 
<Q REND="inline">"that Chri&s;t was not truly incarnate of the
virgin, who&s;e fle&s;h, being the outward man, was &s;infully begotten and

would &s;eem, is not orthodox; and there was a nece&s;&s;ity for delivering the
woman to the flames for maintaining it. But the young King, tho' in &s;uch
tender years, had more &s;en&s;e than all his coun&s;ellors and preceptors; and
he long refu&s;ed to &s;ign the warrant for her execution. Cranmer was employed
to per&s;wade him to compliance; and he &s;aid, that there was a great
difference between errors in other points of divinity, and tho&s;e which were
directly contradictory to the Apo&s;tles creed: Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e latter were impieties again&s;t God, which the
prince, being God's deputy, ought to repre&s;s; in like manner, as the King's
deputies were bound to puni&s;h offences again&s;t the King's per&s;on. Edward,
overcome by importunity more than rea&s;on, at la&s;t &s;ubmit|ted, tho' with
tears in his eyes; and he told Cranmer, that, if any wrong was done, the guilt
&s;hould lie entirely on his head. The primate, after making a new effort to
reclaim the woman from her errors, and finding her ob&s;tinate again&s;t all
his arguments, at la&s;t committed her to the flames. Some time after, a
Dutchman, called Van Paris, accu&s;ed of the here&s;y which has received the
name of Ariani&s;m, was condemned to the &s;ame puni&s;hment. He 
<PB N="319" REF="324"> &s;uffered with &s;o much &s;atisfaction, that he hugged

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;contents of the people.</NOTE> THERE is
no abu&s;e &s;o great, in civil &s;ociety, as not to be attended with a great
variety of beneficial con&s;equences; and in the beginnings of re|formation,
the lo&s;s of the&s;e advantages is always felt very &s;en&s;ibly, while the
benefit, re&s;ulting from the change, is the &s;low effect of time, and is
&s;eldom per|ceived by the bulk of a nation. Scarce any in&s;titution can be
imagined le&s;s fa|vourable, in the main, to the intere&s;ts of mankind than
that of monks and friars; yet was it followed by many good effects, which,
having cea&s;ed by the &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion of mona&s;teries, were very much
regreted by the people of England. The monks, re&s;iding always in their
convents, in the heart of their e&s;tates, &s;pent their money in the provinces
and among their tenants, afforded a ready market for commodities, were a &s;ure
re&s;ource to the poor and indigent; and though their ho&s;pitality and charity
gave but too much encouragement to idlene&s;s, and pre|vented the encrea&s;e of
public riches, yet did it provide to many a remedy again&s;t 
<PB N="320" REF="325"> the extreme pre&s;&s;ures of want and nece&s;&s;ity. It
is al&s;o ob&s;ervable, that, as the friars were limited by the rules of their
in&s;titution, to a certain train of life, they had not equal motives for
avarice with other men; and they were acknow|ledged to have been in England, as
they &s;till are in Roman catholic countries, the be&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent
landlords. The abbots and priors were allowed to give lea&s;es at an
under-value, and to receive, in return, a large pre&s;ent from the tenant; in
the &s;ame manner as is &s;till practi&s;ed by the bi&s;hops and colleges. But
when the abbey-lands were di&s;tributed among the great nobility and courtiers,
they fell under a different management: The rents of farms were rai&s;ed, while
the tenants found not the &s;ame facility in di&s;po&s;ing of the produce; the
money was &s;pent in the capital; and the farmers, living at a di&s;tance, were
expo&s;ed to all the oppre&s;&s;ions of their new ma&s;ters, or to the &s;till
greater rapacity of the &s;tewards.</P>
<P>THESE complaints of the common people were at that time
heightened by other cau&s;es. The arts of manufacture were much more advanced
in other Eu|ropean countries than in England; and even in England the&s;e arts
had made greater progre&s;s than the knowledge of agriculture; a
profe&s;&s;ion, which of all mechanical employments, requires the mo&s;t
reflection and experience. A great demand aro&s;e for wool both abroad and at
home: Pa&s;turage was found more profitable than un&s;kilful tillage: Whole
e&s;tates were laid wa&s;te by inclo&s;ures: The tenants, regarded as a
u&s;ele&s;s burthen, were expelled their habitations: Even the cottagers,
deprived of the commons, on which they fed their cattle, were reduced to
mi&s;ery: And a great decay of people, as well as diminution of the former
plenty, was remarked in the kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. II.
Repo&s;itory Q.</NOTE>. This grievance was now of an old date; and Sir Thomas
More, alluding to it, ob&s;erves in his Utopia, that a &s;heep had become in
England a more rapacious animal than a lion or wolf, and devoured whole
villages, cities, and provinces.</P>
<P>THE general encrea&s;e al&s;o of gold and &s;ilver in Europe,
after the di&s;covery of the We&s;t Indies, had a tendency to inflame the&s;e
complaints. The growing de|mand, in the more commercial countries, had
heightened every where the price of commodities, which could ea&s;ily be
tran&s;ported thither; but in England, the labour of men, who could not &s;o
ea&s;ily change their habitation, &s;till remained nearly at the antient rates;
and the poor people complained that they could no longer gain a
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence by their indu&s;try. It was by an addition alone of toil and
application they were enabled to provide a maintenance; and tho' this
en|crea&s;e of indu&s;try was at la&s;t the effect of the pre&s;ent
&s;ituation, and an effect <PB N="321" REF="326"> very beneficial to &s;ociety,
yet was it difficult for the people to &s;hake off their former habits of
indolence; and nothing but nece&s;&s;ity could compel them to that exertion of
their faculties.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t al&s;o be remarked, that the profu&s;ion of Henry the
eighth, had re|duced him, notwith&s;tanding his rapacity, to &s;uch
difficulties, that he had been obliged to remedy a pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity, by
the pernicious expedient of deba&s;ing the coin; and the wars, in which the
protector had been involved, had induced him to carry &s;till farther the
&s;ame abu&s;e. The u&s;ual con&s;equences en&s;ued: The good coin was hoarded
or exported; ba&s;e metal was coined at home or imported from abroad in great
abudance; the common people, who received their wages in it, could not
purcha&s;e commodities at the u&s;ual rates; an univer&s;al diffidence and
&s;tagnation of commerce took place; and loud complaints were heard in every
part of England.</P>
<P>THE protector, who loved popularity, and compa&s;&s;ionated the
condition of the people, encouraged the&s;e complaints by his endeavours to
remedy them. He appointed a commi&s;&s;ion for making enquiry concerning
inclo&s;ures; and i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, ordering all late inclo&s;ures to
be laid open by a day a&s;&s;igned. The populace, meeting with &s;uch
countenance from the government, began to ri&s;e in &s;everal places, and to
commit di&s;orders; but were quieted by remon&s;trances and per&s;ua&s;ion. In
order to give them greater &s;atisfaction, Somer&s;et appointed new
commi&s;&s;ioners, whom he &s;ent every where, with an unlimited power to hear
and determine all cau&s;es about inclo&s;ures, high-ways, and cottages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 115. Strype, vol. II. p. 171.</NOTE>. As
the object of this commi&s;&s;ion was very di&s;agreeable to the gentry and
nobility, they called the commi&s;&s;ion arbitrary and illegal; and the common
people, fearing it would be eluded, and being impatient for immediate
redre&s;s, could no longer contain their &s;ury, but &s;ought for a remedy by
force of arms. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrections.</NOTE> The ri&s;ing began at
once in &s;everal parts of England, as if an univer&s;al con&s;piracy had been
formed by the commonalty. The in&s;urgents in Wilt&s;hire were di&s;per&s;ed by
Sir William Her|bert: Tho&s;e in the neighbouring counties, Oxford and
Gloce&s;ter, by lord Gray of Wilton. Many of the rioters were killed in the
field: Others were executed by martial law. The commotions in Hamp&s;hire,
Su&s;&s;ex, Kent, and other coun|ties, were quieted by gentler methods; but the
di&s;orders in Devon&s;hire and Nor|folk threatened the mo&s;t fatal
con&s;equences.</P>
<P>THE commonalty in Devon&s;hire began with the u&s;ual pretence
of inclo&s;ures and of oppre&s;&s;ions from the gentry; but the pari&s;h
prie&s;t of Sampford-Courtenay, had the addre&s;s to give their di&s;contents a
direction towards religion; and the delicacy of this &s;ubject, in the
pre&s;ent emergence, made the in&s;urrection imme|diately <PB N="322" REF="327"> appear dangerous. In other counties, the gentry had kept clo&s;ely
united with the government; but here many of them took part with the populace;
among others, Humphrey Arundel, governor of St. Michael's Mount. The rioters
were brought to the form of a regular army, and amounted to the number of
10,000 men. Lord Ru&s;&s;el had been &s;ent again&s;t them at the head of a
&s;mall force; but finding him&s;elf too weak to encounter them in the field,
he kept at a di&s;|tance, and began to treat and negotiate with them; in hopes
of eluding their fury by delay, and of di&s;per&s;ing them by the difficulty of
their &s;ub&s;i&s;ting to|gether. Their demands were, that the ma&s;s &s;hould
be re&s;tored, half of the abbey-lands re&s;umed, the law of the &s;ix articles
executed, holy water and holy bread re&s;pected, and all other particular
grievances redre&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 292.

an&s;wer; exhorted the rebels to di&s;per&s;e; and promi&s;ed them pardon upon
their immediate &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Enraged at this di&s;appointment, they
marched to Exeter; carrying before them cro&s;&s;es, banners, holy water,
candle&s;ticks, and other implements of the antient &s;uper&s;tition; together
with the ho&s;te, which they covered with a canopy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 76.</NOTE>. The inhabitants of Exeter &s;hut their
gates; and the in&s;urgents, as they had no can|non, endeavoured to take the
place, fir&s;t by &s;calade, then by mining, but were repul&s;ed in all their
attempts. Ru&s;&s;el meanwhile lay at Honiton, till reinforced by Sir William
Herbert, and lord Gray, with &s;ome German hor&s;e, and &s;ome Italian
arquebu&s;iers under Batti&s;ta Spinola. He then re&s;olved to attempt the
relief of Exeter, which was now reduced to extremities. He attacked the
re|bels, drove them from all their po&s;ts, committed great &s;laughter upon
them both in the action and pur&s;uit<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stow's

<P>THE in&s;urrection in Norfolk ro&s;e &s;till to a greater
height, and was attended with greater violences. The populace were at fir&s;t
excited, as in other places, by the complaints again&s;t inclo&s;ures; but
finding their numbers amount to twenty thou|&s;and men, they grew in&s;olent on
their force, and proceeded to more exorbitant preten&s;ions. They required the
&s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the gentry, the placing new coun|&s;ellors about the King,
and the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the antient rites. One Ket, a tanner, had
a&s;&s;umed the government of them; and he exerci&s;ed his authority 
<PB N="323" REF="328"> with the utmo&s;t in&s;olence and outrage. Having taken
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mou&s;hold-Hill near Norwich, he erected his tribunal
under an old oak, thence called the oak of reformation; and &s;ummoning the
gentry to appear before him, he gave &s;uch decrees as might be expected from
his character and &s;ituation. The mar|quis of Northampton was fir&s;t ordered
again&s;t him; but met with a repul&s;e, in an action, where lord Sheffield was
killed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 597. Holling&s;hed, 1030-31.

protector affected popu|larity, and cared not to appear in per&s;on again&s;t
the in&s;urgents: He therefore &s;ent next the earl of Warwic at the head of
6000 men, levied for the wars again&s;t Scotland; and he thereby afforded his
mortal enemy an opportunity of augment|ing his reputation and character.
Warwic, having tried &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes with the rebels, at la&s;t made a
general attack upon them, and put them to flight. Two thou&s;and of them fell
in the fight and pur&s;uit: Ket was hanged at Nor|wich ca&s;tle; nine of his
followers on the boughs of the oak of reformation; and the in&s;urrection was
entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Some rebels in York&s;hire, hearing of the fate of
their companions, accepted the offers of pardon, and threw down their arms. A
general indemnity was &s;oon after publi&s;hed by the protector<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 297, 298, 299.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the war with Scotland.</NOTE>BUT
tho' the in&s;urrections were thus quickly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in England, and no
traces of them &s;eemed to remain, they were attended with very bad
con&s;equences with regard to the foreign intere&s;ts of the nation. The forces
of the earl of Warwic, which might have made a great impre&s;&s;ion on
Scotland, were diverted from that enterprize; and De Thermes had leizure to
reduce that country to &s;ome &s;ettlement and compo&s;ure. He took the
fortre&s;s of Broughty, and put the garri&s;on to the &s;word. He &s;traitened
the Engli&s;h at Haddington; and though lord Dacres found means to throw relief
into the place, and to reinforce the gar|ri&s;on, it was found very
expen&s;ive, and even impracticable to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
fortre&s;s. The whole country in the neighbourhood was laid wa&s;te by the
inroads both of the Scotch and Engli&s;h, and could afford no &s;upply to the
gar|ri&s;on: The place lay above thirty miles from the borders; &s;o that a
regular army was nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;cort thither any provi&s;ions: And as the
plague had broke out among the troops, they peri&s;hed daily, and were reduced
to a &s;tate of great weakne&s;s. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, orders were given to
di&s;mantle Haddington, and to convoy the artillery and garri&s;on to Berwic;
and the earl of Rutland, now created warden of the ea&s;t marches, executed the
orders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">With France.</NOTE> THE King of France al&s;o
took advantage of the di&s;tractions of the Engli&s;h, in order to recover
Boulogne, and that territory, which Henry the eighth had con|quered from

thinking the place tenable after the lo&s;s of the other fortre&s;&s;es,
de&s;troyed the works, and retired to Boulogne. The rains, which fell in great
abundance during the autumn, and a pe&s;tilential di&s;temper, which broke out
in the French camp, depriv|ed Henry of all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t
Boulogne it&s;elf; and he retired to Paris<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 300.</NOTE>. He left the command of the army to
Ga&s;par de Coligny, lord of Chatillon, &s;o famous afterwards under the name

event<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le Thou, King Edward's Journal, Stow, p.

<P>AS &s;oon as the French war broke out, the protector endeavoured
to fortify him&s;elf with the alliance of the emperor; and he &s;ent over
&s;ecretary Paget to Bru&s;&s;els, where Charles then re&s;ided, in order to
a&s;&s;i&s;t Sir Philip Hobby, the or|dinary amba&s;&s;ador, in this
negotiation. But that prince had formed a de&s;ign of extending his dominions
by acting the part of champion to the catholic religion; and tho' extremely
de&s;irous of fortifying him&s;elf by the Engli&s;h alliance again&s;t France,
his capital enemy, he thought it un&s;uitable to his other preten&s;ions to
enter into &s;trict confederacy with a nation, which had broke off all
connexions with the church of Rome. He therefore declined all advances of
friend&s;hip from England; and eluded the applications of the amba&s;&s;adors.
An exact ac|count is pre&s;erved of this negotiation in a letter of Hobby; and
it is remark|able, that the emperor, in a conver&s;ation with the Engli&s;h
mini&s;ters, a&s;&s;erted, that the prerogatives of a King of England were more
exten&s;ive than tho&s;e of a King of France<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 132, 175.</NOTE>. Burnet, who pre&s;erves this
letter, &s;ubjoins, as a parallel in&s;tance, that one objection which the
Scotch made to marrying their Queen with Edward, was that all their privileges
would be &s;wallowed up by the great prerogative of the Kings of England<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 133.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOMERSET, finding no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the emperor, was
inclined to conclude a peace with France and Scotland; and be&s;ides that he
was not in a condition to maintain &s;uch ruinous wars, he thought, that there
no longer remained any ob|ject <PB N="325" REF="330"> of ho&s;tilities. The
Scotch had &s;ent away their Queen; and could not, if ever &s;o much inclined,
compleat the marriage contracted with Edward: And as Henry the eighth had
&s;tipulated to re&s;tore Boulogne in 1554, it &s;eemed a matter of &s;mall
con&s;equence to anticipate a few years, the term of the treaty. But when he
propo&s;ed the&s;e rea&s;ons to the council, he met with &s;trong oppo&s;ition
from his enemies, who, &s;eeing him unable to &s;upport the war, were
determined, for that very rea&s;on, to oppo&s;e all propo&s;als for a
pacification. The factions ran very high in the court of England; and matters
were drawing to an i&s;&s;ue, fatal to the authority of the protector.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Factions in the council.</NOTE>AFTER
Somer&s;et obtained the patent, inve&s;ting him with regal authority, he no
longer paid any attention to the opinion of the other coun&s;ellors; and being
elated with his high dignity, as well as with his victory at Pinkey, he
thought, that every one ought, in every thing, to yield to his &s;entiments.
All tho&s;e who were not entirely devoted to him, were &s;ure to be neglected;
whoever oppo&s;ed his will received marks of anger or contempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol&punc; II. p. 181.</NOTE>; and while he &s;howed
a re&s;olution to govern every thing, his capacity appeared not, in any
re&s;pect, proportioned to his ambition. Warwic, more &s;ubtle and artificial,
covered more exorbitant views under fairer appearances; and having
a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf with Southampton, who had been readmitted into the
council, he formed a &s;trong party, who were de|termined to free them&s;elves
from the &s;lavery, impo&s;ed on them by the protector.</P>
<P>THE malecontent coun&s;ellors found the di&s;po&s;ition of the
nation very favourable to their de&s;igns. The nobility and gentry were in
general di&s;plea&s;ed with the preference, which Somer&s;et &s;eemed to have
given the people; and as they a&s;cribed all the in&s;ults to which they had
been lately expo&s;ed, to his procra&s;tination, and to the encouragement given
the multitude, &s;o they apprehended a renewal of the &s;ame di&s;orders from
his pre&s;ent affectation of popularity. He had erected a court of reque&s;ts
in his own hou&s;e for the relief of the people<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">b. p. 183.</NOTE>,
and he inter|po&s;ed with the judges in their behalf; a mea&s;ure which might
be denominated illegal, if any exertion of prerogative, at that time, could
with certainty de&s;erve that appellation. And this attempt, which was a
&s;tretch of power, &s;eemed the more unpolitic, that it di&s;gu&s;ted the
nobility, the &s;ure&s;t &s;upport of monarchical authority.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Somer&s;et courted the people, the intere&s;t, which he
had formed with them, was in no degree an&s;werable to his expectations. The
catholic party, who retained influence with the multitude, were his declared
enemies; and took ad|vantage of every opportunity to decry his conduct. The
attainder and execution of his brother bore an odious a&s;pect: The
introduction of foreign troops into the <PB N="326" REF="331"> kingdom, was
repre&s;ented in very invidious colours: The great e&s;tate which he had

the&s;e imprudences were remarked by Somer&s;et's enemies, who re&s;olved to
take advantage of them. The lord St. John, pre&s;ident of the council, the
earls of Warwic, Southampton, and Arundel, with five coun&s;ellors more, met at
Ely-hou&s;e; and a&s;&s;uming to them&s;elves the whole power of the council,
began to act independent of the protector, whom they repre&s;ented as the
author of every public grievance and misfortune. They wrote letters to the
chief nobility and gentry in England, informing them of the pre&s;ent
mea&s;ures, and requiring their a&s;&s;i&s;tance: They &s;ent for the mayor and
aldermen of London, and enjoin|ed them to obey their orders, without regard to
any contrary orders which they &s;hould receive from the duke of Somer&s;et.
They laid the &s;ame injunctions on the lieutenant of the tower, who
expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;olution to comply with them. Next day, Rich, lord
chancellor, the marquis of Northampton, the earl of Shrew&s;bury, Sir Thomas
Cheney, Sir John Gage, Sir Ralph Sadler, and the lord chief ju&s;tice Montague,
joined the malecontent coun&s;ellors; and every thing bore a bad a&s;pect for
the protector's authority. Secretary Petre, whom he had &s;ent to treat with
the council, cho&s;e rather to remain with them; and the com|mon council of the

<P>THE protector had no &s;ooner heard of the defection of the
coun&s;ellors, than he removed the King from Hampton-court, where he then
re&s;ided, to the ca&s;tle <PB N="327" REF="332"> of Wind&s;or; and, arming his
friends and &s;ervants, &s;eemed re&s;olute to defend him&s;elf again&s;t all
his enemies. But finding, that no man of rank, except Cran|mer and Paget,
adhered to him, that the people did not ri&s;e at his &s;ummons, that the City
and Tower had declared again&s;t him, that even his be&s;t friends and
confidents had de&s;erted him, he lo&s;t all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, and began to
apply to his enemies for pardon and forgivene&s;s. No &s;ooner was this
de&s;pondency known, than lord Ru&s;&s;el, Sir John Baker, &s;peaker of the
hou&s;e of commons, and three coun&s;ellors more, who had hitherto remained
neuters, joined Warwic's party, whom every body now regarded as ma&s;ters. The
council informed the public, by proclamation, of their actions and intentions;
they wrote to the prince&s;&s;es Mary and Elizabeth, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e;
they made addre&s;&s;es to the King, in which, after the humble&s;t
prote&s;tations of duty and obedience, they informed him, that they were the
council appointed by his father, for the government of the kingdom during his
minority; that they had cho&s;en the duke of Somer&s;et protector, with the
expre&s;s condition that he &s;hould guide him&s;elf by their advice and
direction; that he had u&s;urped the whole authority to him&s;elf, and had
ne|glected, and even in every thing oppo&s;ed, their advice; that he had
proceeded to that height of pre&s;umption, as to levy forces again&s;t them,
and place the&s;e forces about his maje&s;ty's per&s;on: They therefore begged,
that they might be admitted to his royal pre&s;ence, that he would be plea&s;ed
to re&s;tore them to his confidence, and that Somer&s;et's &s;ervants might be
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.

chief, at lea&s;t the be&s;t founded, is his u&s;urpation of the government,

&s;entiments of tho&s;e times, that power was, in &s;ome degree, involved in
the very idea of regal authority.</P>
<P>THE catholics were extremely elevated with this revolution; and
as they had a&s;cribed all the late innovations to Somer&s;et's councils, they
hoped, that his fall would prepare the way for the return of the ancient
religion. But Warwic, who now bore chief &s;way in the council, was entirely
indifferent with regard to all the&s;e points of controver&s;y; and finding,
that the principles of the reformation <PB N="328" REF="333"> had &s;unk deeper
into the young prince's mind than to be ea&s;ily eradicated, he was determined
to comply with his inclinations, and not to hazard his new acquired power by
any hazardous councils. He took care very early to expre&s;s his inten|tions of
&s;upporting the reformation; and he threw &s;uch di&s;couragements on
Southampton, who &s;tood at the head of the Romani&s;ts, and whom he
con&s;idered as a dangerous rival, that the high-&s;pirited nobleman retired
from the council, and &s;oon after died of vexation and di&s;appointment. The
other coun&s;ellors, who had concurred in bringing about the revolution,
received their reward, by pro|motions and new honours. Ru&s;&s;el was created
earl of Bedford: The marquis of Northampton obtained the office of great
chamberlain; and lord Wentworth, be&s;ides the office of chamberlain of the
hou&s;hold, got two large manors, Step|ney and Hackney, which were torne from

members who had formerly been ap|pointed by Somer&s;et, and who derived their

Warwic earl mar&s;hal. The pro&s;ecution again&s;t him was carried no farther.

<P>THE intention of marrying the King to a daughter of Henry, who
was a vio|lent per&s;ecutor of the prote&s;tants, was no wi&s;e acceptable to
that party in Eng|land: But, in all other re&s;pects, the council was very
&s;teady in promoting the reformation, and in enforcing the laws again&s;t the
Romani&s;ts. Many of the prelates were &s;till addicted to that communion; and
tho' they made &s;ome com|pliances, in order to &s;ave their bi&s;hoprics, they
retarded, as much as they &s;afely could, the execution of the new laws, and
gave countenance to &s;uch as were ne|gligent or refractory. A re&s;olution was
therefore taken to &s;eek pretences for depriving them; and the execution of
this intention was the more ea&s;y, that they had all of them been obliged to
take commi&s;&s;ions, in which it was declared, that they held their &s;ees
only during the King's plea&s;ure. It was thought proper to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro&s;ecution of Gardiner.</NOTE>begin with Gardiner, in order to
&s;trike a terror into the re&s;t. The method of proceeding again&s;t him was
extremely violent, and had &s;carce any colour of law or ju&s;tice. It had been
pre&s;cribed him, to inculcate in a &s;ermon, the duty of obedience to a King
even during his minority; and becau&s;e he had neglected this topic, he had
been thrown into pri&s;on, and had been there detained during two years,
without being accu&s;ed of any crime, except di&s;obedience to this arbitrary
command. The duke of Somer&s;et, &s;ecretary Petre, and &s;ome others of the
council, were now &s;ent, in order to try his temper, and endeavour to find
&s;ome <PB N="331" REF="336"> ground for depriving him: He profe&s;&s;ed to
them his intention of conforming to the government, of &s;upporting the King's
laws, and of officiating by the new liturgy. This was not the di&s;po&s;ition
which they expected or de&s;ired<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p.

articles to &s;ub&s;cribe. He was to acknowlege his former mi&s;behaviour, and
confe&s;s the ju&s;tice of his confinement: He was likewi&s;e to own, that the
King was &s;upreme head of the church; that the power of making and
di&s;pen&s;ing with holidays, was part of the prerogative; that the
common-prayer book was a godly and commendable form; that the King was a
compleat &s;overeign in his minority; that the act of the &s;ix articles was
ju&s;tly repealed; and that the King had full authority to cor|rect and reform
what was ami&s;s in eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline, government, or doc|trine.
The bi&s;hop was willing to put his hand to all the articles except the
fir&s;t: He maintained his conduct to have been inoffen&s;ive; and declared,
that he would not own him&s;elf guilty of faults which he had never
committed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p. 305. from the council

<P>THE council, finding that he had gone &s;uch lengths, were
determined to pre|vent his full compliance, by multiplying the difficulties
upon him, and &s;ending him new articles to &s;ub&s;cribe. A li&s;t was
&s;elected of &s;uch points as they thought would be mo&s;t hard of
dige&s;tion; and not content with the&s;e, they in&s;i&s;ted &s;till on his

&s;ub&s;cription more mortifying, they required a promi&s;e, that he would
recom|mend and publi&s;h all the&s;e articles from the pulpit: But Gardiner,
who &s;aw, that they intended either to ruin or di&s;honour him, or perhaps
both, was deter|mined not to gratify his enemies by any farther compliances: He
&s;till in&s;i&s;ted on his innocence; de&s;ired a fair trial; and refu&s;ed to
&s;ub&s;cribe more articles, till he &s;hould recover his liberty. For this
pretended offence his bi&s;hopric was put under &s;eque&s;tration for three
months; and as he then appeared no more com|pliant than at fir&s;t, a

appealed from the commi&s;&s;ioners to the King. His appeal was not regarded:

overwhelm the evangelical faith, and de&s;troy its partizans by fire and

divi&s;ions among them&s;elves, which afterwards became the object of &s;uch
furious quarrels and animo&s;ities, and threw the whole kingdom into
confu&s;ion. Several Lutheran divines, who had reputation in tho&s;e days,
Bucer, Peter Martyr, and others, were engaged to take &s;helter in Eng|land,
from the per&s;ecutions which the emperor exerci&s;ed in Germany; and they
received protection and encouragement. John A-la&s;co, a nobleman, uncle to the

&s;ome time, at Embden in Ea&s;t-Friezland, where he became preacher to a
congregation of the reformed. Fore&s;eeing the per&s;ecutions which en&s;ued,
he removed to England, and brought his congregation along with him. The
council, who regarded them as indu&s;trious, u&s;eful people, and de&s;ired to
invite over others of the &s;ame character, not only gave them Augu&s;tine
friars church for the exerci&s;e of their religion, but granted them a charter,
by which they were erected into a corporation, con&s;i&s;ting of a
&s;uper-intendant and four a&s;&s;i&s;ting mini&s;ters. This eccle&s;ia&s;tical

<P>THE theological zeal of the council, tho' &s;eemingly fervent,
went not &s;o far as to make them neglect their own temporal concerns, which
&s;eem to have been ever uppermo&s;t in their thoughts: They even found
lei&s;ure to attend to the pub|lic intere&s;t; nay, to the commerce of the
nation, which was, at that time, very little the object of general &s;tudy or
attention. The trade of England had anci|ently been carried on altogether by
foreigners, chiefly the inhabitants of the Han&s;e-towns, or Ea&s;terlings, as
they were called; and in order to encourage the&s;e merchants to &s;ettle in
England, they had been erected into a corporation by Henry the third, had
obtained a patent, were endowed with privileges, and were exempted from
&s;everal heavy duties paid by aliens. So ignorant were the Engli&s;h of
commerce, that this company, commonly denominated the merchants of the
Steel-yard, engro&s;&s;ed almo&s;t the who'e foreign trade of the kingdom; and
as they naturally employed the &s;hipping of their own country, the naviga|tion
of England was al&s;o in a very langui&s;hing condition. It was therefore
thought proper by the council to find pretences for annulling the privileges of
this corporation, privileges which put them nearly on an equal footing with
Eng|li&s;hmen in the duties which they paid; and as &s;uch patents were, during
that are granted by the ab&s;olute power of the King, men were the le&s;s

innovation, by Lubec, Hamburgh, and other Han&s;e towns; but the coun|cil
per&s;evered in their re&s;olution, and the good effects of it became &s;oon
vi&s;ible to the nation. The Engli&s;h, by their very &s;ituation as na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ives, had advantages

not contented with the &s;tation which he had at|tained, carried farther his

Northumberland, Northampton, and Pem|broke at a banquet, which was to be given
them by lord Paget. Crane and his wife confirmed Palmer's te&s;timony with

committed, were owing to weakne&s;s, not to any bad intentions. His virtues
were better calculated for private than for public life; and by his want of

he was, for the fir&s;t offence, to be held a traitor<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">5 &amp; 6 Edw. VI. cap. 2.</NOTE>. It may be worthy of notice,
that the King and his next heir, the lady Mary, were profe&s;&s;edly of

of here&s;y, &s;chi&s;m, idolatry, prophanene&s;s, bla&s;phemy, wickedne&s;s,

<P>THE commons annexed to this bill a clau&s;e which was of much

any kind of trea&s;on, unle&s;s the crime was proved by the oaths of two
witne&s;&s;es, who were confronted with the pri&s;oner. The lords &s;crupled to
pa&s;s this clau&s;e; tho' required by the mo&s;t obvious principles of equity,
and tho' their own intere&s;t was fully as much concerned as that of the
commons. But the members of that hou&s;e tru&s;ted for protection to their

<P>A BILL was introduced into the hou&s;e of peers for making a

By this bill, the church-wardens were empowered to collect charitable
contributions for the poor, and if any re|fu&s;ed to contribute, or
di&s;&s;waded others from that charity, the bi&s;hop of the dio|ce&s;e was
empowered to proceed again&s;t them. Such a large di&s;cretionary power,

<P>THERE was another occa&s;ion in which the Parliament repo&s;ed
an unu&s;ual confidence in the bi&s;hops. They empowered them to proceed
again&s;t &s;uch as neglected the Sundays and holydays<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. cap. 3.</NOTE>. But the&s;e were unguarded conce&s;&s;ions
granted to the church: The general humour of the times led men to bereave the
eccle&s;ia&s;tics of all their power, and even to pillage them of all their
property: Many clergymen were obliged for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance to turn
carpenters or taylors, and &s;ome kept alehou&s;es<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>. The bi&s;hops
them&s;elves were generally reduced to po|verty, and held both their revenues
and &s;piritual office by a very precarious and uncertain tenure.</P>
<P>TONSTAL, bi&s;hop of Durham, was one of the mo&s;t eminent
prelates of that age, &s;till le&s;s for the dignity of his &s;ee, than for his
own per&s;onal merit, his learning, moderation, humanity, and bene&s;icence. He
had oppo&s;ed, by his vote and authority, all the innovations in religion; but
&s;o &s;oon as they were enacted, he had always &s;ubmitted, and had paid
conformity to each &s;y&s;tem of religion, which was e&s;tabli&s;hed. The known
probity of his mind had made this compli|ance be a&s;cribed, not to an
intere&s;ted or time &s;erving &s;pirit, but to a &s;en&s;e of duty, which led
him to think that all private opinions ought to be &s;acrificed to the great
concerns of public peace and tranquillity. That general regard which 
<PB N="340" REF="345"> was paid his character, had pre&s;erved him from any
&s;evere treatment during the protector&s;hip of Somer&s;et; but when
Northumberland gained the a&s;cendant, he was thrown into pri&s;on; and as that
rapacious nobleman had formed a de&s;ign of appropriating the revenues of the
&s;ee of Durham, and of forming to him&s;elf a principality in the northern
counties, he was re&s;olved, in order to effectuate his purpo&s;e, to deprive
Ton&s;tal of his bi&s;hopric. A bill of attainder, therefore, under pretence of
mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, was introduced into the hou&s;e of peers again&s;t
that prelate; and it pa&s;&s;ed with the oppo&s;ition only of lord Stourt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n, a zealous catholic, and of Cranmer,
who always bore a cordial and &s;incere friend|&s;hip to the bi&s;hop of
Durham. But when the bill was &s;ent down to the commons, they required that
witne&s;&s;es &s;hould be examined, that Ton&s;tal &s;hould be allowed to
defend him&s;elf, and that he &s;hould be confronted with his accu&s;ers: And
when the&s;e demands were refu&s;ed, they rejected the bill.</P>
<P>THIS equity, &s;o unu&s;ual in the Parliament during that age,
was a&s;cribed by Northumberland and his partizans, not to any regard for
liberty and ju&s;tice, but to the prevalence of Somer&s;et's faction in a
hou&s;e of commons, which, being cho&s;en during the admini&s;tration of that
nobleman, had been almo&s;t entirely filled with his creatures. They were
confirmed in this opinion, when they &s;ound, that a bill confirming the
attainder of Somer&s;et and his complices was al&s;o rejected by the commons,
tho' it had pa&s;&s;ed the upper hou&s;e. A re&s;olution was<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th April.</NOTE>therefore taken to di&s;&s;olve the Parliament,

<P>IT is remarkable, that this attempt was made during the reign of
a minor King, when the royal authority is u&s;ually weake&s;t; that it was

Northumberland's expectations. As Ton&s;tal had in the interval been deprived

to try him, the &s;ee of Durham was by act of Parliament divided into two
bi&s;hoprics, which had certain portions of the revenue a&s;&s;igned them. The
regalities of the &s;ee, which included the juri&s;diction of a count palatine,
were given by the King to Northumberland; and it was not to be doubted but that

the u&s;ual practice of the courtiers, whenever a bi&s;hopric fell vacant.</P>
<P>THE commons gave the mini&s;try another mark of attachment,
which was at that time the mo&s;t &s;incere, the mo&s;t cordial, and the mo&s;t

<P>THE debts of the crown were at this time very con&s;iderable.
The King had received from France 400,000 crowns on delivering Boulogne; he had
reaped profits from the &s;ale of &s;ome chantry lands; the churches had been
de&s;poiled of all their plate and rich ornaments, which, by a decree of

were, at the &s;ame time, made of the royal deme&s;nes. The young prince
&s;howed, among other virtues, a di&s;po&s;ition to frugality, which, had he
lived, would &s;oon have retrieved the&s;e lo&s;&s;es: But as his health was
declining very fa&s;t, the pre&s;ent emptine&s;s of the exchequer was a 
<PB N="342" REF="347"> &s;en&s;ible ob&s;tacle to the execution of tho&s;e
projects, which the ambition of North|umberland had founded on the pro&s;pect
of Edward's approaching end.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Succe&s;&s;ion changed.</NOTE> THAT nobleman
repre&s;ented to the prince, whom youth and an infirm &s;tate of health made
&s;u&s;ceptible of every impre&s;&s;ion, that his two &s;i&s;ters, Mary and
Eli|zabeth, had both been declared illegitimate by act of Parliament, and tho'
Henry by his will had re&s;tored them to a place in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the
nation would never bear to &s;ee the throne of England filled by a ba&s;tard:
That they were only the King's &s;i&s;ters by the half-blood; and even if they
were legitimate, could not enjoy the crown as his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors:
That the Queen of Scots &s;tood excluded by the king's will; and being an
alien, lo&s;t all right of inheriting by the law; not to mention, that, as
&s;he was betrothed to the dauphin, &s;he would, by her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
render England, as &s;he had already done Scotland, a province to France: That
the certain con&s;equence of his &s;i&s;ter Mary's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or that of
the Queen of Scots, was the abolition of the prote&s;tant religion, the repeal
of tho&s;e laws enacted in favour of the reformation, and the
re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the u&s;urpations and idolatry of the church of Rome:
That fortunately for England, the &s;ame order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which
ju&s;tice required, was al&s;o the mo&s;t conform|able to public intere&s;t;
and there was not on any &s;ide any ju&s;t ground for doubt or deliberation:
That when the&s;e three prince&s;&s;es were excluded by &s;uch &s;olid
rea&s;ons, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion devolved to the marchione&s;s of Dor&s;et,
elde&s;t daughter to the French Queen and the duke of Suffolk: That the next
heir of the marchio|ne&s;s was the lady Jane Gray, a lady of the mo&s;t amiable
virtue, accompli&s;hed by the be&s;t education, both for literature and for
religion; and every way worthy of a throne: And that even, if her title by
blood &s;hould be doubtful, which there was no ju&s;t rea&s;on to pretend, the
King was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame power, which his father enjoyed; and
might leave her the crown by letters patent. The&s;e rea&s;onings made
impre&s;&s;ion on the young prince; and above all, his zea|lous affection for
the prote&s;tant religion made him apprehend the con&s;equences, if &s;o
bigotted a catholic as his &s;i&s;ter Mary &s;hould &s;ucceed to the throne.
And tho' he bore a tender affection to the lady Elizabeth, who was liable to no
&s;uch objection, means were found to per&s;wade him, that he could not exclude
the one &s;i&s;ter, on account of illegitimacy, without al&s;o giving an
exclu&s;ion to the other.</P>
<P>NORTHUMBERLAND, finding that his arguments were likely to
operate on the King, began to prepare the other parts of that political fabric,
which he in|tended to rai&s;e. Two &s;ons of the duke of Suffolk by a &s;econd
venter having died, this &s;ea&s;on, of the &s;weating &s;ickne&s;s, that title
was extinct; and Northum|berland engaged the King to be&s;tow it on the marquis
of Dor&s;et. By means of <PB N="343" REF="348"> this favour and of others,
which he conferred upon him, he per&s;uaded the new duke of Suffolk and the
dutche&s;s, to give their daughter, the lady Jane, in marriage to his fourth
&s;on, the lord Guilford Dudley. In order to fortify him&s;elf by farther
alliances, he negotiated a marriage between the lady Catherine Gray, &s;econd
daughter to Suffolk, and lord Herbert, elde&s;t &s;on to the earl of Pembroke.
He al&s;o married his own daughter to lord Ha&s;tings, elde&s;t &s;on to the
earl of Huntingdon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 109. Stowe, 609.</NOTE>.
The&s;e marriages were &s;olemnized with great pomp and fe&s;tivity; and the
people, who hated Northumberland, could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing their
indignation at &s;eeing the&s;e public demon&s;trations of joy, during the
langui&s;hing &s;tate of the young prince's health.</P>
<P>EDWARD had been &s;eized in the foregoing year, fir&s;t with the
mea&s;les, then with the &s;mall pox; but having perfectly recovered both
the&s;e di&s;tempers, the nation entertained hopes, that they would only
&s;erve to confirm his health; and he had afterwards made a progre&s;s thro'
&s;ome parts of the kingdom. It was &s;u&s;pected, that he had there
over-heated him&s;elf in exerci&s;es: He was &s;eized with a cough,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's &s;icknets.</NOTE>which proved ob&s;tinate, and gave
way neither to regimen nor medicines: Seve|ral fatal &s;ymptoms of a
con&s;umption appeared; and tho' it was hoped, that, as the &s;ea&s;on of the
year advanced, his youth and temperance might get the better of the malady, men
&s;aw with great concern his bloom and vigour in&s;en&s;ibly de|cay. The
general attachment to the young prince, joined to the hatred borne the Dudleys,
made it be remarked, that Edward had every moment declined in health, from the
time that lord Robert Dudley had been put about him, in the quality of
gentleman of the bedchamber.</P>
<P>THE langui&s;hing &s;tate of Edward's health made Northumberland
the more in|tent on the execution of his project. He removed all, except his
own emi&s;&s;aries, from about the King: He him&s;elf attended him with the
greate&s;t a&s;&s;iduity: He pretended the mo&s;t anxious concern for his
health and welfare: And by all the&s;e artifices, he prevailed on him to give
his final con&s;ent to the &s;ettlement projected. Sir Edward Montague, chief
ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, Sir John Baker and Sir Thomas Bromley, two
judges, with the attorney and &s;ollicitor general were &s;ent for to the
council; where, after the minutes of the intended deed were
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ad to them, the King required them
to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters"> them up in the form of
letters patent. They he&s;itated in obeying this order; and de&s;ired time to
con&s;ider of it. The more they reflected, the greater dang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> they &s;ound in compliance. The
&s;ettlement of the crown by Henry the eighth had been made in con&s;equence of
an art of Parliament; and by another act, pa&s;&s;ed in the beginning of this
reign, it was declared trea&s;on in any of the heirs, their aiders or abettors,
to attempt on the <PB N="344" REF="349"> right of another, or change the order
of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The judges pleaded the&s;e rea&s;ons before the council.
They urged, that &s;uch a patent as was intended would be entirely invalid;
that it would &s;ubject, not only the judges who drew it, but every
coun&s;ellor who &s;igned it, to the pains of trea&s;on; and that the only
proper expedient, both to give force to the new &s;ettlement, and free its
partizans from danger, was to &s;ummon a Parliament, and obtain the con&s;ent
and &s;anction of that a&s;&s;embly. The King &s;aid, that he intended
afterwards to follow that method, and would call a Parliament, in which he
propo&s;ed to have his &s;ettlement ratified; but in the mean time, he required
the judges, on their allegiance, to draw the patent in the form required. The
council told the judges, that their refu&s;al would &s;ubject them all to the
pains of trea&s;on. Northumberland gave to Mon|tague the appellation of
traitor; and &s;aid that he would fight in his &s;hirt with any man in &s;o
ju&s;t a quarrel as that of the lady Jane's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The judges were
reduced to great difficulties between the dangers of the law, and tho&s;e
ari&s;|ing from the violence of pre&s;ent power and authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuller, book VIII. p. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE arguments were canva&s;&s;ed in &s;everal different meetings
between the council and the judges; and no &s;olution could be found of the
pre&s;ent difficulties. At la&s;t, Montague propo&s;ed an expedient, which
&s;atisfied both his brethren and the coun&s;ellors. He de&s;ired, that a
&s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed by the King and council,
requiring the judges to draw a patent for the new &s;ettlement of the crown;
and that a pardon &s;hould immediately after be granted them for any offence
which they might have committed by their compliance. When the pa|tent was drawn
and brought to the bi&s;hop of Ely, chancellor, in order to pa&s;s the great
&s;eal, that prelate required, that all the judges &s;hould &s;ign it.
Go&s;nald at fir&s;t refu&s;ed; and it was with much difficulty, that he was
prevailed on, by the violent menaces of Northumberland, to comply; but the
con&s;tancy of Sir James Hales, who, tho' a zealous prote&s;tant, preferred
ju&s;tice on this occa&s;ion to the prejudices of his party, could not be
&s;haken by any expedient. The chan|cellor next required, for his greater
&s;ecurity, that all the privy councellors &s;hould &s;et their hands to the
patent: The intrigues of Northumberland or the fears of his vio|lence<NOTE PLACE="marg">21&s;t June.</NOTE>were &s;o prevalent, that the coun&s;ellors
complied with this demand. Cranmer alone he&s;itated during &s;ome time, but
yielded at la&s;t to the earne&s;t and pathetic entreaties of the King<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">anm.
Mem. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>. Cecil, at
that time &s;ecretary of &s;tate, pretended alter|wards that he only &s;igned
as a witne&s;s to the King's &s;ub&s;cription. And thus, by the King's letters
patent, the two prince&s;&s;es, Mary and Elizabeth, were &s;et a&s;ide; and the
crown was &s;ettled on the heirs of the dutche&s;s of Suffolk: For the
dutche&s;s her&s;elf was content to be po&s;tponed to her daughters.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="350"> AFTER this &s;ettlement was made, with
&s;o many inau&s;picious circum&s;tances, Edward declined vi&s;ibly every day
in his health; and &s;mall hopes were entertained of his recovery. To make the
matter wor&s;e, his phy&s;icians were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by Northumberland's
advice and by an order of council; and he was put into the hands of an ignorant
woman, who undertook, in a little time, to re&s;tore him to his former &s;tate
of health. After the u&s;e of her medicines, all the bad &s;ymp|toms
encrea&s;ed to the mo&s;t violent degree: He felt a difficulty of &s;peech and
breathing; his pul&s;e failed, his legs &s;welled, his colour became livid; and
many<NOTE PLACE="marg">And death&punc; 6th July.</NOTE>other &s;ymptoms
appeared of his approaching end. He expired at Greenwich in the &s;ixteenth
year of his age, and the &s;eventh of his reign.</P>
<P>ALL the Engli&s;h hi&s;torians dwell with plea&s;ure on the
excellencies of this young prince; whom the flattering promi&s;es of hope,
joined to many real virtues, had made an object of the mo&s;t tender affections
of the public. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed mild|ne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, application
to &s;tudy and bu&s;ine&s;s, a capacity to learn and judge, and an attachment
to equity and ju&s;tice. He &s;eems only to have con|tracted from his education
and from the age in which he lived, too much of a narrow prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
in matters of religion, which made him incline &s;omewhat to bigotry and
per&s;ecution: But as the bigotry of prote&s;tants, le&s;s governed by
prie&s;ts, lies under more re&s;traints than that of catholics, the effects of
this ma|lignant quality were the le&s;s to be apprehended, if a longer life had

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE title of the prince&s;s Mary to the crown, after the
decea&s;e of her brother, was not liable to any con&s;iderable difficulty; and
the objections &s;tarted by the lady Jane's partizans, were new and unheard-of
by the nation. Tho' all the prote&s;tants, and even many of the catholics,
believed the marriage of Henry the eighth with Catherine of Arragon to be
un|lawful and invalid; yet as it had been contracted by the parties without any
criminal intention, had been avowed by their parents, recognized by the nation,
and &s;eemed &s;ounded on tho&s;e principles of law and religion, which then
prevailed, very few imagined, that their i&s;&s;ue ought on that account to be
regarded as ille|gitimate. A declaration to that purpo&s;e had indeed been
extorted from the Par|liament by the u&s;ual violence and caprice of Henry; but
as that monarch had afterwards been induced to re&s;tore his daughter to the
right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, her <PB N="348" REF="352"> title was now become as
legal and parliamentary as it was ever e&s;teemed ju&s;t and natural. The
public had been long familiarized to the&s;e &s;entiments: During all the reign
of Edward, the prince&s;s was con&s;idered as his lawful &s;ucce&s;&s;or: And
tho' the prote&s;tants dreaded the effects of her prejudices, the extreme
hatred, univer&s;ally entertained again&s;t the Dudleys<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sleidan&punc; lib. 25.</NOTE>, who, men fore&s;aw, would, under
the name of Jane, be the real &s;overeigns, was more than &s;ufficient to
counterbal|lance, even with that party, the attachment to religion. This la&s;t
attempt, to violate the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, had di&s;played
Northumberland's ambition and inju&s;tice in a full light; and when the people
reflected on the long train of fraud, iniquity and cruelty, by which that
project had been conducted; that the lives of the two Seymours, as well as the
title of the prince&s;&s;es, had been &s;acrificed to it; they were moved by
indignation to exert them&s;elves in oppo&s;ition to &s;uch criminal
enterprizes. The general veneration al&s;o, paid to the memory of Henry the
eighth, prompted the nation to defend the rights of his po&s;terity; and the
mi&s;eries of the antient civil wars were not &s;o entirely forgotten, that men
were willing, by a departure from the lawful heir, to incur the danger of the
like blood|&s;hed and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>NORTHUMBERLAND, &s;en&s;ible of the oppo&s;ition he mu&s;t
expect, had carefully concealed the de&s;tination made by the King; and in
order to bring the two prince&s;&s;es into his power, he had had the precaution
to engage the council, before Edward's death, to write to them in that prince's
name, de&s;iring their attendance, under pretext, that his infirm &s;tate of
health required the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their coun&s;el and the con&s;olation
of their company<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 154.</NOTE>. Edward
expired before their arrival; but Northumberland, in order to make the
prince&s;&s;es fall into the &s;hare, kept the King's death &s;till &s;ecret;
and the lady Mary had already reached Hodde&s;den, within half a day's journey
of the court. Happily, the earl of Arundel &s;ent her private intelligence,
both of her brother's death and of the con&s;piracy formed again&s;t her<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 233.</NOTE>: She immediately made ha&s;te to
retire; and ar|rived by quick journeys, fir&s;t at Kenning-hall in Norfolk,
then at Framlingham in Suffolk; where &s;he propo&s;ed to embark and retire to
Flanders, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould find it impo&s;&s;ible to defend her right
of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. She wrote letters to the nobility and mo&s;t
con&s;iderable gentry in every county of England; com|manding them to
a&s;&s;i&s;t her in the defence of her crown and per&s;on. And &s;he
di&s;|patched a me&s;&s;age to the council; by which &s;he notified to them,

the lady Jane, who re&s;ided there, with all the re&s;pect u&s;ually paid to
the &s;overeign. Jane was, in a great mea&s;ure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lady Jane

the mo&s;t engaging di&s;po&s;ition, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed parts; and being
of an equal age with the late King, &s;he had received all her education with
him, and &s;eemed even to po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater facility in acquiring every
part of manly and po|lite literature. She had attained a knowlege of the Roman
and Greek languages, be&s;ide modern tongues; had pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of her time
in an application to learning; and expre&s;&s;ed a great indifference for other
occupations and amu&s;ements u&s;ual with her &s;ex and &s;tation. Roger
A&s;cham, tutor to the lady Elizabeth, having at one time paid her a vi&s;it,
found her employed in the reading of Plato, while the re&s;t of the family were
engaged in a party of hunting in the park; and upon his admiring the
&s;ingularity of her choice, &s;he told him, that &s;he received more
plea&s;ure from that author than the others could reap from all their &s;port
and gaity. Her heart, full of this pa&s;&s;ion for literature and the elegant
arts, and of tenderne&s;s towards her hu&s;band, who was de&s;erving of her
affection, had never opened it&s;elf to the flattering allurements of ambition;
and the information of her advancement to the throne was by no means agreeable
to her. She even re|fu&s;ed to accept the pre&s;ent; pleaded the preferable
right of the two prince&s;&s;es; expre&s;&s;ed her dread of the con&s;equences
attending an enterprize &s;o dangerous, not to &s;ay &s;o criminal; and
de&s;ired to remain in that private &s;tation in which &s;he was born. Overcome
at la&s;t with the entreaties, rather than rea&s;ons, of her fa|ther and
father-in-law, and above all of her hu&s;band, &s;he &s;ubmitted to their will,
and was prevailed on to relinqui&s;h her own judgment. It was then u&s;ual for
the Kings of England, after their acce&s;&s;ion, to pa&s;s the fir&s;t days in

repre&s;enting the inju&s;tice and cruelty of Northumberland, the exorbitancy
of his ambition, the criminal enterprize which he had projected, and the guilt
in which he had involved the whole council; and he a&s;&s;erted, that the only
method of making atonement for their pa&s;t offence, was by a prompt return to
the duty which they owed their lawful &s;overeign<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 331, 332. Thuanus, lib. xiii.</NOTE>. This motion was

and becau&s;e the coun&s;ellors pleaded con&s;traint, as an excu&s;e for their

recovered his liberty; and he owed this indulgence, in a great mea&s;ure, to
the contempt entertained of his capacity. But the guilt of Northumberland was
too great, as well as his ambition and courage too dangerous, to permit him to
entertain any rea&s;onable hopes of life. When brought to his trial, he only

from being agitated with great anxiety concerning the &s;tate of religion; and
as the bulk of the nation in|clined to the prote&s;tant communion,
apprehen&s;ions were generally entertained of the principles and prejudices of
the new Queen. The legitimacy of Mary's birth had appeared to be &s;omewhat
connected with the papal authority; and as that prince&s;s was educated with
her mother, &s;he had imbibed the &s;tronge&s;t attachment to the catholic
communion, and the highe&s;t aver&s;ion to tho&s;e new tenets, whence, &s;he
believed, all the misfortunes of her family had originally &s;prung. The
di&s;|couragements which &s;he lay under from her father, tho' at la&s;t they
brought her to comply with his will, tended &s;till more to increa&s;e her
di&s;gu&s;t to the reformers; and the vexations which the protector and the
council gave her, during Edward's reign, had no other effect than to confirm
her farther in her prejudices. Natu|rally of a four and ob&s;tinate temper, and
irritated by contradictions and mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or|tunes, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the qualities fitted to

nation, therefore, had great rea&s;on to dread, not only the abolition, but the
per&s;ecution of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion from the zeal of Mary; and it was

<P>THE merits of Cranmer towards the Queen, during the reign of

the active part which he bore in promoting her mother's divorce, as well as in

&s;till remained &s;uch numbers devoted, by opinion or affection,

authority of the crown was able to give &s;uch candidates the prevalence in

religion, rather declined taking a &s;eat in the hou&s;e, which, while it
rendered them obnoxious to the Queen, could afterwards afford them no
protection again&s;t the violence of prerogative. It &s;oon appeared,
therefore, that a majority of the commons would be ob&s;equious to Mary's
de|&s;igns; and as the peers were mo&s;tly attached to the court, from
intere&s;t or ex|pectation, little oppo&s;ition was expected from that
quarter.</P>
<P>IN opening the Parliament, the court &s;howed a very &s;ignal
contempt of the laws, by celebrating, before the two hou&s;es, a ma&s;s of the

The Queen, however, &s;till retained the title of &s;upreme head of the church

only to re&s;tore religion to the &s;ame condition in which it had been left by
Henry; but that the other abu&s;es of popery, which were chiefly grievous to
the nation, would never be revived.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t bill pa&s;&s;ed by the Parliament, was of a very
popular nature, and aboli&s;hed every &s;pecies of trea&s;on which was not

mention, however, is made of the pope's authority, as any ground of the

by one vote<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 Mariae, &s;e&s;&s;. 2. c.

foot|ing on which it &s;tood at the death of Henry. The attainder of the duke
of Nor|folk was rever&s;ed; and this act of ju&s;tice was much more
rea&s;onable than the declaring that attainder invalid, without farther
authority. Mo&s;t of the clau&s;es of the riot act, pa&s;&s;ed in the late

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the compliance of the two hou&s;es with the

of a hu&s;band was, in <PB N="357" REF="361"> particular, of &s;uch importance

&s;uppo&s;ed that Mary deliberated after her acce&s;&s;ion to the crown. The
fir&s;t per&s;on propo&s;ed to her, was Courtney, earl of Devon&s;hire, who,
being an Engli&s;hman, nearly allied to the crown, could not fail to be
acceptable to the nation; and as he was of an engaging per&s;on and addre&s;s,
he had gained vi&s;ibly on the Queen's affections, and hints were dropt him of

towards Devon&s;hire; and made her break out in a declared animo&s;ity
again&s;t Elizabeth. The ancient quarrel between their mothers had &s;unk deep
into the malignant heart of the Queen; and after the declaration made by
Parliament in favour of Catherine's marriage, &s;he wanted not a pretence for
repre&s;enting the birth of her &s;i&s;ter as illegitimate. The attachment of
Elizabeth to the reformed religion of|fended Mary's bigotry; and as the young
prince&s;s had made &s;ome difficulty of di&s;gui&s;ing her &s;entiments, very
violent menaces had been employed to bring her to compliance. But when the
Queen found that Elizabeth had ob&s;tructed her views in a point, which,
perhaps, touched her &s;till more nearly, her re&s;entment, excited by pride,
knew no longer any bounds; and the prince&s;s was vi&s;ibly ex|po&s;ed to the
greate&s;t danger<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 31. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">net, vol II. p. 255.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CARDINAL Pole, who had never taken any but deacon's orders, was
another party propo&s;ed to the Queen; and there appeared many rea&s;ons to
induce her to make choice of this prelate. The high character of Pole for
virtue and gene|ro&s;ity; the great regard paid him by the catholic church, of
which he had near|ly reached the highe&s;t dignity on the death of Paul the
third<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, book iii.</NOTE>; the Queen's
af|fection for the counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, his mother, who had once been her
gover|ne&s;s; the violent animo&s;ity to which he had been expo&s;ed on account
of his attachment to the Romi&s;h communion; all the&s;e con&s;iderations had a
pow|erful influence on Mary. But the cardinal was now in the decline of life;
and having contracted habits of &s;tudy and retirement, he was repre&s;ented as
un|qualified for the bu&s;tle of a court, and the hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 31.</NOTE>. The Queen, therefore, dropt all
views of that alliance: But as &s;he entertained a great regard for Pole's
wi&s;dom and virtue, &s;he &s;till propo&s;ed to reap the benefit of his advice
<PB N="358" REF="362"> in the admini&s;tration of her government. She
&s;ecretly entered into a negociation with Commendone, an agent of cardinal
Dandino, legate at Bru&s;&s;els; &s;he &s;ent a&s;&s;urances to the pope, then
Julius the third, of her earne&s;t de&s;ire to reconcile her&s;elf and her
kingdoms to the holy &s;ee; and &s;he de&s;ired that Pole might be appointed
legate for the performance of that pious office<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet,

<P>THESE two marriages being rejected, the Queen ca&s;t her eye
towards the em|peror's family, from which her mother was de&s;cended, and
which, during her greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es, had always afforded her
countenance and protection. Charles the fifth, who a few years before was
almo&s;t ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of Germany, had exerci&s;ed his power in &s;uch an
arbitrary manner, that he gave extreme di&s;gu&s;t to the nation, who
apprehended the total extinction of their liberties and privileges from the
encroachments of that monarch<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib. iv.
c. 17.</NOTE>. Religion had &s;erved him as a pre|tence for his u&s;urpations;
and from the &s;ame principle he met with that oppo&s;i|tion which overthrew
his grandeur, and da&s;hed all his ambitious hopes. Mau|rice, elector of
Saxony, enraged that the landgrave of He&s;&s;e, who, by his ad|vice, and on
his a&s;&s;urances, had put him&s;elf into the emperor's hands, &s;hould be
unju&s;tly detained pri&s;oner, formed a &s;ecret con&s;piracy among the
prote&s;tant princes; and covering his intentions with the mo&s;t artificial
di&s;gui&s;es, he &s;uddenly march|ed his forces again&s;t Charles, and
narrowly mi&s;&s;ed becoming ma&s;ter of his per|&s;on. The prote&s;tants flew
to arms in every quarter; and their in&s;urrection, aid|ed by an inva&s;ion
from France, reduced the emperor to &s;uch extremity, that he was obliged to
&s;ubmit to articles of peace, which en&s;ured the independency of Germany. To
retrieve his honour, he made an attack on France; and laying &s;iege to Metz,
with an army of an hundred thou&s;and men, he conducted the enterprize in
per&s;on, and &s;eemed determined, at all hazards, to &s;ucceed in an
undertaking which had attracted the attention of all Europe. But the duke of
Gui&s;e, who defended M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tz, with a
garri&s;on compo&s;ed of the brave&s;t nobility of France, exerted &s;uch
vigilance, conduct, and valour, that the &s;iege was pro|tracted to the depth
of winter; and the emperor found it dangerous to per&s;e|vere any longer. He
retired with the remains of his army, into the Low Coun|tries, much dejected
with that rever&s;e of fortune which, in his declining years, had &s;o fatally
overtaken him.</P>
<P>NO &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ner did
Charles hear of the death of Edward, and the acce&s;&s;ion of his kin&s;woman,
Mary, to the crown of England, than he formed the &s;cheme of ac|quiring that
kingdom to his family; and he hoped, by this incident, to com|pen&s;ate all the
lo&s;&s;es which he had &s;uffered in Germany. His &s;on, Philip, who 
<PB N="359" REF="363"> was a widower, had but one &s;on by his former marriage;
and tho' he was only twenty-&s;even years of age, eleven years younger than the
Queen, this objection, it was thought, might ea&s;ily be overlooked, and there
was no rea&s;on to de&s;pair of her having &s;till a numerous i&s;&s;ue. The
emperor, therefore, immediately &s;ent over an agent to &s;ignify his
intentions to Mary, who, plea&s;ed with the &s;upport of &s;o power|ful an
alliance, and glad to unite her&s;elf more clo&s;ely with her mother's fami|ly,
to which &s;he was ever &s;trongly attached, readily embraced the propo&s;al.
Norfolk, Arundel, and Paget, gave their advice for the match: And Gardiner, who
was become prime mini&s;ter, and who had been promoted to the office of
chancellor, finding how Mary's inclinations lay, &s;econded the project of the
Spa|ni&s;h alliance; and repre&s;ented, both to her and the emperor, the
nece&s;&s;ity of &s;topping all farther innovations in religion, till the
completion of the marriage. He ob&s;erved, that the Parliament, amid&s;t all
their compliances, had di&s;covered evident &s;ymptoms of jealou&s;y, and
&s;eemed at pre&s;ent determined, to grant no further conce&s;&s;ions in favour
of the catholic religion: That tho' they might make a &s;acrifice to their
&s;overeign of &s;ome &s;peculative principles, which they did not well
comprehend, or of &s;ome rites, which &s;eemed not of any immediate
im|portance, they had imbibed &s;uch &s;trong prejudices again&s;t the
pretended u&s;urpa|tions and exactions of the court of Rome, that they would
with great difficulty be again brought to &s;ubmit to its authority: That the
danger of making a re|&s;umption of the abbey lands, would alarm the nobility
and gentry, and induce them to encourage the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which were
but too general among the peo|ple, again&s;t the doctrine and wor&s;hip of the
catholic church: That much pains had been taken to prejudice the nation
again&s;t the Spani&s;h alliance; and if that point was urged, at the &s;ame
time with further changes in religion, it would ha|zard a general revolt and
in&s;urrection: That the marriage, being once compleat|ed, would give authority
to the Queen's mea&s;ures, and enable her afterwards to forward that pious
work, in which &s;he was engaged: And that it was even ne|ce&s;&s;ary
previou&s;ly to reconcile the people to the marriage, by rendering the
con|ditions extremely favourable to the Engli&s;h, and &s;uch as would &s;eem

their ancient laws and pri|vileges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p.

<P>THE emperor, well acquainted with the prudence and experience of
Gardiner, a&s;&s;ented to all the&s;e rea&s;ons; and he endeavoured to temper
the zeal of Mary, by repre&s;enting the nece&s;&s;ity of proceeding gradually
in the great work of con|verting the nation. Hearing that cardinal Pole, more
&s;incere in his religious opinions, and le&s;s guided by the maxims of civil
policy, after having &s;ent oppo|&s;ite <PB N="360" REF="364"> advice to the
Queen, had &s;et out on his journey to England, where he was to exerci&s;e his
legantine commi&s;&s;ion; he thought proper to &s;top him at Dilling|hen, a
town on the Danube; and he afterwards obtained Mary's con&s;ent for this
detention. The negociation for the marriage mean-while proceeded apace; and
Mary's intentions to e&s;pou&s;e Philip became generally known to the nation.
The commons, who hoped that they had gained the Queen by the conce&s;&s;ions
which they had already made, were alarmed to hear, that &s;he was re&s;olved to
contract a<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of De|cember.</NOTE>foreign alliance; and they
&s;ent a committee to remon&s;trate again&s;t that dangerous mea&s;ure. To
prevent farther applications of the &s;ame kind, &s;he thought proper to
di&s;&s;olve them.</P>
<P>A CONVOCATION had been &s;ummoned at the &s;ame time with the
Parliament; and the majority here al&s;o appeared to be of the court religion.
An offer was very frankly made by the Romani&s;ts, to di&s;pute concerning the
points controvert|ed between the two communions; and as tran&s;ub&s;tantiation
was the article which, of all others, they e&s;teemed the cleare&s;t, and
founded on the mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible ar|gument, they cho&s;e to try their
&s;trength by defending it. The prote&s;tants pu&s;h|ed the di&s;pute as far as
the clamour and noi&s;e of their antagoni&s;ts would permit; and they fondly
imagined, that they had obtained &s;ome advantage, when, in the cour&s;e of the
debate, they obliged the catholics to avow, that, according to their doctrine,
Chri&s;t had, in his la&s;t &s;upper, held him&s;elf in his hand, and had
&s;wal|lowed and eat him&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p.
356. Fox, vol. III. p. 22.</NOTE>. This triumph, however, was confined only to
their own party: The Romani&s;ts maintained, that their champions had clearly
the better of the day; that their adver&s;aries were blind and ob&s;tinate
heretics; that no|thing but the mo&s;t extreme depravity of heart could induce
men to di&s;pute &s;uch &s;elf-evident principles; and that the &s;evere&s;t
puni&s;hments were due to their per|ver&s;e wickedne&s;s. So plea&s;ed were
they with their &s;uperiority in this favorite point, that they &s;oon after
renewed the di&s;pute at Oxford; and to &s;how, that they feared no force of
learning or capacity, where rea&s;on was &s;o evidently on their &s;ide, they
&s;ent thither Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley, under a guard, to try whether
the&s;e renowned controver&s;iali&s;ts could find any appearance of argu|ment
to defend their baffled principles<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mem. of
Cranm. p. 334. Heylin, p. 50.</NOTE>. The i&s;&s;ue of the debate was very
dif|ferent from what it appeared to be a few years before, in a famous
conference held at the &s;ame place during the reign of Edward.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1554" UNIT="year"> AFTER the Parliament and
convocation were broke up, the new laws with re|gard to religion, tho' they had
been anticipated, in mo&s;t places, by the zeal of <PB N="361" REF="365"> the
catholics, countenanced by the government, were &s;till more openly put in
execution: The ma&s;s was every where re-e&s;tabli&s;hed; and marriage was
declared to be incompatible with any &s;piritual office. It has been
a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome writers, that three fourths of the clergy&punc; were, at
this time, deprived of their livings; tho' other hi&s;torians, more

e&s;teemed the number of &s;ufferers far &s;hort of this proportion. Could any
principles of law, ju&s;tice or rea&s;on be at|tended to, where
&s;uper&s;tition predominates; the prie&s;ts would never have been expelled for
their pa&s;t marriages, which at that time were permitted by the laws of the
kingdom. A vi&s;itation was appointed, in order to re&s;tore more perfectly the
ma&s;s and the antient rites. Among other articles the commi&s;&s;ioners were
enjoined to forbid the oath of &s;upremacy to be taken by the clergy on their
receiving any benefice<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p

ob&s;erved, that this oath had been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the laws of Henry the

<P>THIS violent and &s;udden change of religion in&s;pired the
prote&s;tants with great di&s;content; and even affected indifferent
&s;pectators with concern, by the hard|&s;hips, to which &s;o many individuals
were on that account expo&s;ed. But the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen's mar|riage
with Philip.</NOTE>Spani&s;h match was a point of more general concern, and
diffu&s;ed univer&s;al ap|prehen&s;ions for the liberty and independance of the
nation. To obviate all cla|mour, the articles of marriage were drawn as
favourable as po&s;&s;ible for the intere&s;t and &s;ecurity, and even grandeur
of England. It was agreed, that tho' Philip &s;hould have the title of King,
the admini&s;tration &s;hould be entirely in the Queen; that no foreigner
&s;hould be capable of enjoying any office in the kingdom; that no innovation
&s;hould be made in the Engli&s;h laws, cu&s;toms and privileges; that Philip
&s;hould not carry the Queen abroad without her con&s;ent, nor any of her
children without the con&s;ent of the nobility; that &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds
a year &s;hould be &s;ettled on her as her jointure; that the male i&s;&s;ue of
this marriage &s;hould inherit, together with England, both Burgundy and the
Low Countries; and that, if Don Carlos, Philip's &s;on by his former marriage,
&s;hould die and his line be extinct, the Queen's i&s;&s;ue, whether male or
female, &s;hould inherit Spain, Sicily, Milan, and all the other dominions of
Philip<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XV. p. 377.</NOTE>. Such was the treaty
of<NOTE PLACE="marg">1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">th

amba&s;&s;adors &s;ent over to England by the emperor.</P>
<P>THESE articles, when publi&s;hed, gave no &s;atisfaction to the
nation: It was univer&s;ally &s;aid, that the emperor, in order to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of England, would
verbally agree to any terms; and the greater advantage there appeared in the 
<PB N="362" REF="366"> conditions which he granted, the more certainly might it
be concluded, that he had no &s;erious intention of ob&s;erving them: That the
u&s;ual fraud and ambition of that monarch might a&s;&s;ure the nation of
&s;uch a conduct; and his &s;on Philip, while he inherited the&s;e vices from
his father, added to them tyranny, &s;ullenne&s;s, pride, and barbarity, more
dangerous vices of his own: That England would become a province, and a
province to a kingdom which u&s;ually exerci&s;ed the mo&s;t violent authority
over all her dependant dominions: That the Netherlands, Milan, Sicily, Naples
groaned under the burthen of Spani&s;h tyranny; and throughout all the new
conque&s;ts in America there had been di&s;played &s;cenes of unrelenting
cruelty, hitherto unknown in the hi&s;tory of mankind: That the inqui|&s;ition
was a tribunal invented by that tyrannical nation; and would infallibly, with
all their other laws and in&s;titutions, be introduced into England: And that
the divided &s;entiments of the people with regard to religion would &s;ubject
mul|titudes to this iniquitous tribunal, and would reduce the whole nation to
the mo&s;t abject &s;ervitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 32. Burnet,

<P>THESE complaints, being diffu&s;ed thro' the whole people,
prepared the nation for a rebellion; and had any foreign power given them
encouragement, or any great man appeared to head them; the con&s;equences might
have proved fatal to the Queen's authority. But the King of France, tho'
engaged in ho&s;tilities with the emperor, refu&s;ed to concur in any
propo&s;al for an in&s;urrection; le&s;t he &s;hould afford Mary a pretence for
declaring war again&s;t him. And the more prudent part of the nobility thought,
that, as the evils of the Spani&s;h alliance were only dreaded at a di&s;tance,
matters were not yet fully prepared for a general revolt. Some per&s;ons,
however, more turbulent than the re&s;t, believed, that it would be &s;afer to
prevent than to redre&s;s grievances; and they framed a con&s;piracy to
ri&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wiat's in&s;ur|rection.</NOTE>in arms, and declare
again&s;t the Queen's marriage with Philip. Sir Thomas Wiat propo&s;ed to
rai&s;e Kent, Sir Peter Carew, Devon&s;hire; and they engaged the duke of
Suffolk, by the hopes of recovering the crown for the lady Jane, to attempt
rai&s;ing the midland counties<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 33.
Godwin, p. 340.</NOTE>. Carew's impatience or apprehen&s;ions engaged him to
break the concert, and to ri&s;e in arms before the day appointed: He was
&s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the earl of Bedford, and obliged to fly into France.
On this intelligence, Suffolk, dreading an arre&s;t, &s;uddenly left the town,
with his brothers, the lord Thomas, and lord Leonard Gray; and endeavoured to
rai&s;e the people in the counties of Warwic and Leice&s;ter; where his
intere&s;t lay: But he was &s;o clo&s;ely followed by the earl of Huntingdon,
at the head of 300 hor&s;e, that he was obliged to di&s;per&s;e his retainers,
and being di&s;covered in his retreat, he was <PB N="363" REF="367"> led
pri&s;oner to London<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. III. p.
30.</NOTE>. Wiat was at fir&s;t more &s;ucce&s;sful in his attempt; and having
publi&s;hed a declaration at Maid&s;tone in Kent, again&s;t the Queen's evil
coun&s;ellors and again&s;t the Spani&s;h match, without any mention of
religion, the people began to gather under his &s;tandard. The duke of Norfolk
with Sir Henry Jernegan was &s;ent again&s;t him, at the head of the guards and
&s;ome other troops, reinforced with 500 Londoners commanded by Bret: And he
came within &s;ight of the rebels at Roche&s;ter, where they had fixed their
head quarters. Sir George Harper here pretended to de&s;ert from them; but
having &s;ecretly gained Bret, the&s;e two per&s;ons &s;o wrought on the
Londoners, that that whole body de&s;erted to Wiat, and declared that they
would not contribute to en&s;lave their native country. Norfolk, dreading the
contagion of this example, imme|diately retreated with his troops and took
&s;helter in London<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 33. Godwin, p. 341.

<P>AFTER this proof of the di&s;po&s;itions of the people,
e&s;pecially of the Lon|doners, who were mo&s;tly prote&s;tants, Wiat was
encouraged to proceed; and he led his forces to Southwark, where he required of
the Queen, that &s;he &s;hould put the Tower into his hands, &s;hould deliver
four coun&s;ellors as ho&s;tages, and in order to en&s;ure the liberty of the
nation, immediately marry an Engli&s;hman. Finding that the bridge was
&s;ecured again&s;t him, and that the city was over|awed, he marched up to
King&s;ton, where he pa&s;&s;ed the river with 4000 men; and returning towards
London, hoped to encourage his partizans, who had en|gaged to declare for him.
He had imprudently wa&s;ted &s;o much time at South|wark, and in his march from
King&s;ton, that the critical &s;ea&s;on, on which all popular commotions
depend, was entirely lo&s;t; and tho' he entered We&s;tmin&s;ter without
re&s;i&s;tance, his followers, finding that no per&s;on of note joined him,
in|&s;en&s;ibly &s;ell off, and he was at la&s;t &s;eized near Temple-Bar by

Wiat was condemned and exe|cuted; and as it had been reported, that, at his
examination, he had accu&s;ed the lady Elizabeth and the earl of Devon&s;hire,
he took care on the &s;caffold, before the whole people, fully to acquit them
of having any &s;hare in the rebellion.</P>
<P>THE lady Elizabeth had been, during &s;ome time, treated with
great har&s;hne&s;s by her &s;i&s;ter; and many &s;tudies in&s;tances of
di&s;couragement and di&s;re&s;pect had been practi&s;ed again&s;t her. She was
ordered to take place at court after the counte&s;s of L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nox and the dutche&s;s of Suffolk, as if &s;he were not
legitimate, of the <PB N="364" REF="368"> royal blood: Her friends were
di&s;countenanced on every occa&s;ion: And while her virtues, which were now
become very eminent, drew to her the attendance of all the young nobility, and
rendered her the favourite of the nation, the malevolence of the Queen &s;till
di&s;covered it&s;elf every day by fre&s;h &s;ymptoms, and obliged the
prince&s;s to retire into the country. Mary &s;eized the opportunity of this
rebellion; and hoping to involve her &s;i&s;ter in &s;ome appearance of guilt,
&s;ent for her under a &s;trong guard, committed her to the Tower, and ordered
her to be very &s;trictly examined by the council. But the public declaration
made by Wiat rendered it impracticable to employ again&s;t her any fal&s;e
evidence, which might have offered; and the prince&s;s made &s;o good a
defence, that the Queen found her&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of
di&s;mi&s;&s;ing her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 343. Burnet, vol. II.

order to &s;end her out of the kingdom, a marriage was propo&s;ed to her with
the duke of Savoy; and when &s;he declined giving her con&s;ent, &s;he was
committed to cu&s;tody, under a very &s;trong guard, at Wode&s;toke. The earl
of Devon&s;hire, tho' equally inno|cent, was confined in Fortheringay
ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>BUT this rebellion proved &s;till more fatal to the lady Jane
Gray, as well as to her hu&s;band: The duke of Suffolk's guilt was imputed to
her; and tho' the in&s;urgents and malecontents &s;eemed chiefly to re&s;t
their hopes on the lady Eliza|beth and the earl of Devon&s;hire, the Queen,
incapable of genero&s;ity or clemency, was determined to remove every per&s;on,
from whom the lea&s;t danger could be apprehended. Warning was given the lady
Jane to prepare for death; a doom which &s;he had long expected, and which the
innocence of her life, as well as the misfortunes to which &s;he had been
expo&s;ed, rendered no unwelcome news to her. The Queen's bigotted zeal, under
colour of tender mercy to the pri&s;oner's &s;oul, induced her to &s;end
divines, who mole&s;ted her with perpetual di&s;putation; and even a reprieve
of three days was granted her, in hopes that &s;he would be per|&s;uaded,
during that time, to pay, by a timely conver&s;ion, &s;ome regard to her
eternal welfare. The lady Jane had pre&s;ence of mind, in tho&s;e melancholy

her to exe|cution, de&s;ired her to be&s;tow on him &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ent,
which he might keep as a perpetual memorial of her: She gave him her

hu&s;band's dead body; one in Greek, another in Latin, a third in
Engli&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 167.</NOTE>. The purport of them

youth at lea&s;t, and her imprudence were worthy of excu&s;e; and that God and
po&s;terity, &s;he tru&s;ted, would &s;how her favour. On the &s;caffold, &s;he
made a &s;peech to the bye-&s;tanders, where the mildne&s;s of her
di&s;po&s;ition led her to take the blame entirely on her&s;elf, without
uttering one complaint again&s;t the &s;everity, with which &s;he had been
treated. She &s;aid, that her offence was not the having laid her hand upon the
crown, but the not rejecting it with &s;ufficient con&s;tancy: That &s;he had
le&s;s erred thro' am|bition than thro' reverence to her parents, whom &s;he
had been taught to re&s;pect and obey: That &s;he willingly received death, as
the only &s;atisfaction which &s;he could now make to the injured &s;tate; and
tho' her infringement of the laws had been con&s;trained, &s;he would &s;how,
by her voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their &s;entence, that &s;he was
de&s;irous to attone for that di&s;obedience, into which too much &s;ilial
piety had betrayed her: That &s;he had ju&s;tly de&s;erved this puni&s;hment
for being made the in&s;trument, tho' the unwilling in&s;trument, of the
ambition of others: And that the &s;tory of her life, &s;he hoped, might at
lea&s;t be u&s;eful, by proving that inno|cence excu&s;es not great mi&s;deeds,
if they tend any way to the de&s;truction of the commonwealth. After uttering
the&s;e words, &s;he cau&s;ed her&s;elf to be di&s;robed by her women; and with

<P>THO' the government laboured under &s;o general an odium, the

The emperor al&s;o, in order to facilitate the<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.

which he had &s;ent over to England, to be di&s;tributed in bribes and
pen&s;ions among the members: A pernicious practice, of which there had not
hitherto been any in&s;tance in England. And not to give the public any alarm
with regard to the church lands, the Queen, notwith&s;tanding her bigotry,
re&s;umed her legal title of &s;u|preme head of the church, which &s;he had
dropped three months before. Gar|diner, the chancellor, opened the
&s;e&s;&s;ion by a &s;peech; in which he a&s;&s;erted the Queen's hereditary
title to the crown; maintained her right to choo&s;e a hu&s;band for her&s;elf;
he ob&s;erved how proper an u&s;e &s;he had made of that right, by pre|ferring
an old ally, de&s;cended from the hou&s;e of Burgundy; and remarked the failure
of Henry the eighth's po&s;terity, of whom there now remained none but the
Queen and the lady Elizabeth. He added, that, in order to obviate the
in|conveniences, <PB N="367" REF="371"> conveniences, which might ari&s;e from

<P>THE Parliament were much di&s;po&s;ed to gratify the Queen in
all her de&s;ires; but when the liberty, independency, and very being of the
nation were brought into &s;uch vi&s;ible danger, they could not by any means
be brought to compli|ance. They knew both the inveterate hatred which &s;he
bore the lady Elizabeth, and her devoted attachment to the hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria: They were acquainted with her extreme bigotry, which would lead her
to po&s;tpone all con&s;iderations of ju&s;tice or national intere&s;t to the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of the catholic religion: They remarked, that Gardiner had
carefully avoided, in his &s;peech, the giving to Elizabeth the appellation of
the Queen's &s;i&s;ter; and they thence concluded, that a de&s;ign was formed
of excluding her as illegitimate: They expected, that Mary, if inve&s;ted with
&s;uch a power as &s;he required, would make a will in her hu&s;band's favour,
and thereby render England for ever a province of the Spani&s;h monarchy: And
they were the more alarmed with the&s;e projects, when they heard, that
Philip's de&s;cent from the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter was carefully in&s;i&s;ted
on, and that he was publickly repre&s;ented as the true and only heir by right
of inheritance.</P>
<P>THE Parliament, therefore, aware of their danger, were
determined to keep at a di&s;tance from the precipice, which lay before them.
They could not avoid ratifying the articles of marriage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Mar. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">l. 2. cap.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>, which were drawn very
favourable for Eng|land; but they declined pa&s;&s;ing any &s;uch law as the
chancellor pointed out to them: They would not &s;o much as declare it
trea&s;on to imagine or attempt the death of the Queen's hu&s;band, while &s;he
was alive; and a bill introduced for that purpo&s;e was laid a&s;ide after the
fir&s;t reading. The more effectually to cut off Philip's hopes of exerting any
authority in England, they pa&s;&s;ed a law, where they declared, 
<Q REND="inline">"that her maje&s;ty as their only Queen,
&s;hould &s;olely and as a &s;ole Queen, enjoy the crown and &s;overeignty of

<P>A LAW pa&s;&s;ed in this Parliament for re-er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cting the bi&s;hopric of Durham, which
had been di&s;&s;olved by the la&s;t Parliament of Edward<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ib. cap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. The Queen had <PB N="368" REF="372"> already, by an
exertion of her ab&s;olute power, put Ton&s;tal in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
&s;ee: But tho' it was u&s;ual at that time for the crown to a&s;&s;ume
authority which might &s;eem entirely legi&s;lative, it was always e&s;teemed
more &s;afe and &s;atisfactory to procure the &s;anction of Parliament. Bills
were introduced for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing erro|neous opinions contained in books,
and for reviving the law of the &s;ix articles, together with tho&s;e again&s;t
the Lollards, again&s;t here&s;y and erroneous preaching: But none of the&s;e
laws could pa&s;s the two hou&s;es. A proof, that the Parliament had re&s;erves
even in their conce&s;&s;ions with regard to religion; about which they &s;eem
to have been le&s;s &s;crupulous. The Queen, therefore, finding that they<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th May.</NOTE>would not &s;erve all her purpo&s;es, fini&s;hed
the &s;e&s;&s;ion by di&s;&s;olving them.</P>
<P>MARY'S thoughts were now entirely employed about receiving Don
Philip, who&s;e arrival &s;he hourly expected. This prince&s;s, who had lived
&s;o many years in a very re&s;erved and private manner, without any pro&s;pect
or hopes of a hu&s;|band, was &s;o &s;mit with affection for her young
&s;pou&s;e, whom &s;he had never &s;een, that &s;he waited with the utmo&s;t
impatience for the completion of the marriage; and every ob&s;tacle was to her
a &s;ource of anxiety and di&s;content<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol.

could not conceal her vexation, that, tho' &s;he brought him a kingdom for a
dowry, he treated her with &s;uch ne|glect, that he had never yet favoured her
with a &s;ingle letter. Her fondne&s;s was but the more encrea&s;ed by this
&s;upercilious treatment; and when &s;he found that her &s;ubjects had
entertained the greate&s;t aver&s;ion for the event, to which &s;he directed
her fonde&s;t wi&s;hes, &s;he made the whole Engli&s;h nation the object of her
re&s;entment. A &s;quadron, under the command of lord Effingham, had been
fitted out to convoy Philip from Spain, where he then re&s;ided; but the
admiral informing her, that the di&s;contents ran very high among the &s;eamen,
and that it was not &s;afe for Philip to entru&s;t him&s;elf into their hands,
&s;he gave orders to di&s;mi&s;s them. She then dreaded, that the French fleet,
being ma&s;ters of the &s;ea, might intercept her hu&s;band; and every rumour
of danger, every bla&s;t of wind, threw her into panics and convul&s;ions. Her
health, and even her under&s;tanding, were vi&s;ibly impaired by this extreme
impatience; and &s;he was &s;truck with a new apprehen&s;ion, left her
per&s;on, impaired by time, and bla&s;ted by &s;ickne&s;s, &s;hould render her
le&s;s acceptable to her future &s;pou&s;e. Her gla&s;s di&s;covered to her how
hagard &s;he was become, and when &s;he remarked the decay of her per&s;on,
&s;he knew not whether &s;he ought more to de&s;ire or apprehend the arrival of
Philip.</P>

nothing was more agreeable to the nation than his protection of the lady

the nation re|mained &s;till &s;omewhat incredulous; and men were per&s;uaded,
that the Queen laboured under infirmities, which rendered her incapable of
having children. Her infant proved only the commencement of a drop&s;y, which
the di&s;or|dered &s;tate of her health had brought upon her. The belief,
however, of her pregnancy was &s;till maintained with all po&s;&s;ible care;

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s which Gardiner, from his cautious and prudent
conduct, had met with in governing the Parliament, and engaging them both to
ap|prove of the Spani&s;h alliance, and the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the ancient
religion, two points, to which, it was believed, they bore an extreme
aver&s;ion, had &s;o rai&s;ed his character for wi&s;dom and policy, that his
opinion was received as an oracle in the Queen's councils; and his authority,
as it was always great in his own party, no longer &s;uffered any oppo&s;ition
or controul. Cardinal Pole him&s;elf, tho' more beloved on account of his
virtue and candour, and tho' &s;upe|rior in birth and &s;tation, had not equal
weight in public deliberations; and while his learning, piety, and humanity
were extremely re&s;pected, he was repre&s;ented more as a good man than a
great mini&s;ter. A very important que&s;tion was fre|quently debated, before
the Queen and council, by the&s;e two eccle&s;ia&s;tics; whe|ther the laws
lately revived again&s;t heretics &s;hould be put in execution, or &s;hould
only be employed to re&s;train, by terror, the bold attempts of the&s;e
zealots. Pole was very &s;incere in his religious principles; and tho' his
moderation had made <PB N="374" REF="378"> him be &s;u&s;pected at Rome of a
tendency towards Lutherani&s;m; he was &s;eriou&s;ly per&s;uaded of the
catholic doctrines, and thought that no con&s;ideration of human policy ought
ever to come in competition with &s;uch important intere&s;ts. Gar|diner, on
the contrary, had always made his religion &s;ub&s;ervient to his &s;chemes of
&s;afety or advancement; and by his unlimited complai&s;ance to Henry, he had
&s;hown, that had he not been pu&s;hed to extremity under the late minority, he
was &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to make a &s;acrifice of his principles to the
e&s;tabli&s;hed theo|logy. This was the well-known character of the&s;e two
great coun&s;ellors; yet &s;uch is the prevalence of temper above &s;y&s;tem,
that the benevolent di&s;po&s;ition of Pole led him to advi&s;e a toleration of
the heretical tenets which he highly blamed; while the &s;evere manners of
Gardiner inclined him to &s;upport, by per&s;ecution, that religion which, at
the bottom, he regarded with great indifference<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> p 17.</NOTE>. This circum&s;tance
of public conduct was of the highe&s;t importance; and from being the object of
deliberation in the council, it &s;oon became the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e
throughout the nation. We &s;hall repre&s;ent, in a few words, the topics by
which each &s;ide &s;upported, or might have &s;upported, their &s;cheme of
policy; and &s;hall di&s;play the oppo&s;ite rea&s;ons which have been
employed, with regard to an ar|gument that ever has been, and ever will be &s;o
much canva&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons for and again&s;t
toleration.</NOTE> THE practice of per&s;ecution, &s;aid the defenders of
Pole's opinion, is the &s;can|dal of all religion; and the theological
animo&s;ity, &s;o fierce and violent, far from being an argument of men's
conviction in their oppo&s;ite tenets, is a certain proof, that they have never
reached any &s;erious per&s;ua&s;ion with regard to the&s;e remote and
&s;ublime &s;ubjects. Even tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t impatient of
contradiction in other controver&s;ies, are mild and moderate in compari&s;on
of polemical divines; and wherever a man's knowlege and experience give him a
perfect a&s;&s;urance of his own opinion, he regards with contempt, rather than
anger, the oppo&s;ition and mi&s;takes of others. But while men zealou&s;ly
maintain what they neither clearly comprehend, nor entirely believe, they are
&s;haken in their imagined &s;aith, by the oppo&s;ite per&s;ua&s;ion, or even
doubts of other men; and vent on their an|tagoni&s;ts that impatience which is
the natural re&s;ult of &s;o di&s;agreeable a &s;tate of the under&s;tanding.
They then embrace ea&s;ily any pretence for repre&s;enting op|pon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ts as impious and prophane; and if they
can al&s;o find a colour for co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nect|ing this violence with the intere&s;ts of civil government,
they can no longer be re&s;trained from giving uncont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ouled &s;cope to vengeance and re&s;entment. But
&s;urely never enterprize was more unfortunate than that of founding per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e|cution upon policy, or endeavouring,
for the &s;ake of peace, to &s;ettle an entire uni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ormity of opinion, in que&s;tions which, of all others,
are lea&s;t &s;ubjected to <PB N="375" REF="379"> the criterion of human
rea&s;on. The univer&s;al and uncontradicted prevalence of one opinion in
religious &s;ubjects, can only be owing at fir&s;t to the &s;tupid igno|rance
and barbari&s;m of the people, who never indulge them&s;elves in any
&s;pecula|tion or enquiry; and there is no other expedient for maintaining that
uniformity, &s;o fondly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ought
after, but by bani&s;hing for ever all curio&s;ity and all improvement in
&s;cience and cultivation. It may not, indeed, appear difficult to ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ck, by a &s;teddy &s;everity, the
fir&s;t beginnings of controver&s;y; but be&s;ides that this policy expo&s;es
for ever the people to all the abject terrors of &s;uper&s;tition, and the
magi|&s;trate to the endle&s;s encroachments of ecc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ia&s;tics, it al&s;o renders men
&s;o delicate, that they can never endure to hear of oppo&s;ition; and they
will &s;ometime pay dearly for that fal&s;e tranquility in which they have been
&s;o long indulged. As healthful bodies are ruined by too nice a regimen, and
are thereby rendered inca|pable of bearing the unavoidable incidents of human
life; a people who never were allowed to imagine, that their principles could
be conte&s;ted, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly out into the
mo&s;t outrageous violence when any event (and &s;uch events are common)
produces a faction among their clergy, and gives ri&s;e to any difference in
tenet or opinion. But whatever may be &s;aid in favour of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing, by
per&s;ecution, the fir&s;t be|ginnings of here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y, no &s;olid argument can be alledged for extending &s;everity
to|wards multitudes, or endeavouring, by capital puni&s;hments, to extirpate an
opi|nion, which has diffu&s;ed it&s;elf thro' men of every rank and &s;tation.
Be&s;ides the extreme barbarity of &s;uch an attempt, it proves commonly
ineffectual to the pur|po&s;e intended; and &s;erves only to make men more
ob&s;tinate in their per&s;ua&s;ion, and to encrea&s;e the number of their
pro&s;elytes. The melancholy with which the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ear of death, torture, and
per&s;ecution in&s;pires the &s;ectaries, is the proper di&s;po|&s;ition for
fo&s;tering religious zeal: The pr &s;pect of eternal reward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, when brought near, overpowers the
dread of temporal puni&s;hment: The glory of martyrdom &s;timulates all the
more furious zealots, e&s;pecially the leaders and preachers&punc; Where a
violent animo&s;ity is excited by oppre&s;&s;ion, men pa&s;s naturally from
hat|ing the per&s;ons of their tyrants, to a more violent abhorrence of their
doctrine&punc; And the &s;pectat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, moved with pity towards the &s;uppo&s;ed martyrs, are naturally
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">educed to embrace tho&s;e
principles which can in&s;pire men with a con&s;tancy that appears almo&s;t
&s;upernatural. Open the door to toleration, the mutual hatred re|laxes among
the &s;ectaries; their attachment to their particular religion decays&punc; the
common occupations and plea&s;ures of life &s;ucceed to the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rimony of di&s;putation; and the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ame man, who, in other
circum&s;tances, would have braved &s;lames and tortures, is engaged to change
his religion from the &s;malle&s;t pro&s;pect of favour and advancement, or
even from the frivolous hopes of becom|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">g more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;hionable in
his principles. If any exception can be admitted to this <PB N="376" REF="380">
maxim of toleration, it will only be where a theology altogether new, no way
connected with the ancient religion of the &s;tate, is imported from foreign
coun|tries, and may ea&s;ily, at one blow, be eradicated, without leaving the
&s;eeds of future innovations. But as this in&s;tance would involve &s;ome
apology for the an|cient pagan per&s;ecutions, or for the extirpation of
Chri&s;tianity in China and Ja|pan; it ought &s;urely, on account of this
dete&s;ted con&s;equence, to be rather bu|ried in eternal &s;ilence and
oblivion.</P>
<P>THO' the&s;e arguments appear entirely &s;atisfactory, yet
&s;uch is the &s;ubtilty of human wit, that Gardiner, and the other enemies to
toleration, were not reduced to &s;ilence, and they &s;till found topics on
which to &s;upport the controver&s;y. The doctrine, &s;aid they, of liberty of
con&s;cience is founded on the mo&s;t flagrant im|piety, and &s;uppo&s;es
&s;uch an indifference among all religions, &s;uch an ob&s;curity in
theological doctrines, as to render the church and magi&s;trate incapable of
di&s;tin|gui&s;hing, with certainty, the dictates of Heaven from the mere
fictions of hu|man imagination. If the Divinity reveals principles to mankind,
he will &s;urely give a criterion by which they may be a&s;certained; and a
prince, who knowingly allows the&s;e principles to be perverted, or
adulterated, is infinitely more criminal than if he gave permi&s;&s;ion for the
vending of poi&s;on, under the &s;hape of bread, to all his &s;ubjects.
Per&s;ecution may, indeed, &s;eem better calculated to make hy|pocrites than
converts; but experience teaches us, that the habits of hypocri&s;y often turn
into reality; and the children at lea&s;t, ignorant of their parents
di&s;&s;i|mulation, may happily be educated in more orthodox tenets. It is
ab&s;urd, in op|po&s;ition to con&s;iderations of &s;uch un&s;peakable
importance, to plead the temporal and frivolous intere&s;ts of civil &s;ociety;
and if matters be thoroughly examined, even that topic will not appear &s;o
certain and univer&s;al in favour of toleration as by &s;ome i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> is repre&s;ented. Where &s;ects
ari&s;e, who&s;e fundamental principle on all &s;ides, is to execr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">te, and abhor, and damn, and extirpate
each other; what choice has the magi&s;trate left but to take party, and by
rendering one &s;ect entirely prevalent, re&s;tore, at lea&s;t for a time, the
public tranquillity? The political body, being here &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">ly, mu&s;t not be treated as if it were in a &s;tate of
found health; and an affected neutrality in the prince, or even a cool
preference, may &s;erve only to en|courag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the hopes of all the &s;ects, and keep alive their animo&s;ity.
The pro|te&s;tants, far from tol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rating the religion of their ance&s;tors, regard it as an impi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters"> and dete&s;table idolatry; and during

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Violent per|&s;ecution in England.</NOTE> THE
per&s;ecutors began with Rogers, who was prebendary of St. Paul's, and a man
eminent in his party for virtue as well as for learning. Gardiner's plan was
fir&s;t to attack men of that character, whom, he hoped, terror would bend to
&s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, and who&s;e example, either of puni&s;hment or recantation,
would natu|rally have influence on the multitude: But he found a per&s;everance

very powerful temptations to compliance: He had a wife, whom he tenderly loved,
and ten children; yet &s;uch was his &s;erenity after his condemnation, that
the jailors, it is &s;aid, waked him from a &s;ound &s;leep, when the hour of
his execution approached. He had de&s;ired to &s;ee his wi&s;e before he died;

on the mouth, and bid him &s;peak Latin: Another, in a rage, gave him a blow on
the head with his halbert, which happily put an end to his&punc;torments.</P>
<P>THERE was one Philpot, archdeacon of Winche&s;ter,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch zeal for orthodoxy, that having been engaged in a
di&s;pute with an Arian, he &s;pit in his adver&s;ary's face, to &s;how the
great dete&s;tation which he had entertained again&s;t that here&s;y. He
afterwards wrote a treati&s;e to ju&s;tify this unmannerly expre&s;&s;ion of
zeal; and he &s;aid, that he was led to it, in order to relieve the &s;orrow
con|ceived from &s;uch horrid bla&s;phemy, and to &s;ignify how unworthy &s;uch
a mi&s;|creant was of being admitted into the company of any chri&s;tian<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 261. and Coll. N^o 58.</NOTE>. Philpot was a

Smithfield.</P>
<P>THE article upon which almo&s;t all the prote&s;tants were
condemned, was, their refu&s;al to acknowlege the real pre&s;ence. Gardiner,
who had vainly expected, that a few examples would &s;trike a terror into the
reformers, finding the work daily multiply upon him, devolved the invidious
office on others, chiefly on Bon|ner, a man of profligate manners, and of a

<P>IT is needle&s;s to be particular in enumerating all the horrid
cruelties practi&s;ed in England during the cour&s;e of three years that
the&s;e per&s;ecutions la&s;ted: The &s;avage barbarity on the one hand, and
the patient con&s;tancy on the other, are &s;o &s;imilar in all the&s;e
martyrdoms, that the narration, very little agreeable in it&s;elf, would never
be relieved by any variety. Human nature appears not, on any oc|ca&s;ion, &s;o
dete&s;table, and at the &s;ame time &s;o ab&s;urd, as in the&s;e religious
per&s;ecu|tions, which &s;ink men below infernal &s;pirits in wickedne&s;s, and
below the bea&s;ts in folly. A few in&s;tances only may be worth pre&s;erving,
in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to warn zealous bigots, for ever to avoid &s;uch
odious and &s;uch fruitle&s;s barbarity.</P>
<P>FERRAR, bi&s;hop of St. David's, was burned in his own

may more naturally be a&s;cribed to them than to the religious zealots) as to
tye bags of gunpowder about the&s;e prelates, in order to put a &s;peedy period

<P>ONE Hunter, a young man of nineteen, an apprentice, having been
&s;educed by a prie&s;t into a di&s;pute, had unwarily denied the real
pre&s;ence. Sen&s;ible of his danger, he immediately concealed him&s;elf; and
Bonner laying hold of his fa|ther, threatened him with the greate&s;t
&s;eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ties, if he did not produce
the young man to &s;tand his tryal. Hunter, hearing the vexations to which his
father was expo&s;ed, voluntarily delivered him&s;elf to Bonner, and was
condemned to the flames by that barbarous prelate.</P>
<P>THOMAS Haukes, when conducted to the &s;take, agreed with his
friends, that if he found the torture tolerable, he would make them a &s;ignal
to that purpo&s;e in the mid&s;t of the flames. His zeal for the cau&s;e in
which he &s;uffered, &s;o &s;upport|ed him, that he &s;tretched out his arms,
the &s;ignal agreed on; and in that po&s;ture <PB N="380" REF="384"> he
expired<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. III. p. 265.</NOTE>. This example,
with many others of like con&s;tancy, encouraged multitudes, not only to
&s;uffer, but even to a&s;pire to martyrdom.</P>
<P>THE tender &s;ex it&s;elf, as they have commonly a greater
propen&s;ity to religion, produced many in&s;tances of the mo&s;t inflexible
courage in &s;upporting the profe&s;|&s;ion of it, again&s;t all the fury of
the per&s;ecutors. One execution in particular was attended with
circum&s;tances which, even at that time, excited a&s;toni&s;hment, by rea&s;on
of their unu&s;ual barbarity. A woman in Guern&s;ey, being near the time of her
labour when brought to the &s;take, was thrown into &s;uch agitation by the
torture, that her belly bur&s;t, and &s;he was delivered in the mid&s;t of the
flames. One of the guards immediately &s;natched the infant from the fire, and
attempted to &s;ave it: But a magi&s;trate who &s;tood by, ordered it to be
thrown back; being determined, he &s;aid, that nothing &s;hould &s;urvive which

<P>THE per&s;ons condemned to the&s;e puni&s;hments were not
convicted for teaching, or dogmatizing, contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed
religion: They were &s;eized merely on &s;u&s;picion; and articles being
offered them to &s;ub&s;cribe, they were immediately, upon their refu&s;al,
condemned to the flames<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 306.</NOTE>.
Tho&s;e in&s;tances of barbarity, &s;o unu&s;ual in the nation, excited horror;
the con&s;tancy of the martyrs was the object of admiration; and as men have a
principle of equity engraven in their minds, which even fal&s;e religion is not
able totally to obliterate, they were &s;hock|ed to &s;ee per&s;ons of probity,
of honour, of pious di&s;po&s;itions, expo&s;ed to pu|ni&s;hments more &s;evere
than were inflicted on the greate&s;t ruffians, for crimes &s;ub|ver&s;ive of
civil &s;ociety. To exterminate the whole prote&s;tant party, was known to be
impo&s;&s;ible; and nothing could appear more iniquitous, than to &s;ubject to
torture, the mo&s;t con&s;cientious and courageous among them; and allow the
cowards and hypocrites to e&s;cape. Each martyrdom, therefore, was equivalent
to a hundred &s;ermons again&s;t popery; and men either avoided &s;uch horrid
&s;pec|tacles, or returned from them full of a violent, tho' &s;ecret,
indignation again&s;t the per&s;ecutors. Repeated orders were &s;ent from the
council, to quicken the dili|gence of the magi&s;trates in &s;earching after
heretics; and, in &s;ome places, the gentry were obliged to countenance, by
their pre&s;ence, the&s;e barbarous executi|ons. The violences tended only to
render the Spani&s;h government daily more odious; and Philip, &s;en&s;ible of
the hatred which he incurred, endeavoured to remove the reproach from him&s;elf
by a very gro&s;s artifice: He ordered his con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;or to deliver in his pre&s;ence a &s;ermon in favour of
toleration: a doctrine <PB N="381" REF="385"> &s;omewhat extraordinary in a

court, finding that Bonner, however &s;hamele&s;s and &s;avage, would not bear
alone the whole infamy, &s;oon threw off the ma&s;k; and the unrelenting temper
of the Queen, as well as of the King, appeared without controul. A bold &s;tep
was even taken towards the intro|duction of the inqui&s;ition into England. As
the bi&s;hops' courts, tho' extremely arbitrary, and not bound by any ordinary
forms of law, appeared not to be inve&s;ted with &s;ufficient power, a
commi&s;&s;ion was appointed by authority of the Queen's prerogative, more
effectually to extirpate here&s;y. Twenty-one per&s;ons were named; but any
three were armed with the powers of the whole. The com|mi&s;&s;ion runs in
the&s;e terms; 
<Q REND="inline">"That &s;ince many fal&s;e rumours were

mi&s;behaviours or negligences, in any church or chap|pel; and to try all
prie&s;ts that did not preach the &s;acrament of the altar; all per&s;ons that
did not hear ma&s;s, or come to their pari&s;h church to &s;ervice, that would
not go in proce&s;&s;ions, or did not take holy bread or holy water: And if
they found any that did ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in &s;uch here&s;ies, they
were to put them into the hands of their ordinaries, to be puni&s;hed according
to the &s;piri|tual laws: Giving the commi&s;&s;ioners full power to proceed,
as their di&s;cre|tions and con&s;ciences &s;hould direct them, and to u&s;e
all &s;uch means as they would invent for the &s;earching of the premi&s;es;
empowering them al&s;o to call before them &s;uch witne&s;&s;es as they

this tyrannical edict even exceeded the oppre&s;&s;ion of the inqui&s;ition; by

&s;ome mea&s;ure, nece&s;&s;ary, wherever that end is earne&s;tly

<P>BUT the court had devi&s;ed a more expeditious and &s;ummary

as their violence and their pernicious tendency, which ought to be the object

<P>WE have thrown together almo&s;t the whole tran&s;actions
again&s;t heretics, tho' carried on during a cour&s;e of three years; that we
may be obliged, as little as po&s;&s;ible, to return to &s;uch &s;hocking
violences and barbarities. It is computed, that in that time two hundred and
&s;eventy-&s;even per&s;ons &s;uffered by fire; be&s;ides tho&s;e puni&s;hed by
impri&s;onment, fines, and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;cations. Among tho&s;e who &s;uffered by fire, were five
bi&s;hops, twenty-one clergymen, eight lay gentlemen, eighty-four trade&s;men,
one hundred hu&s;bandmen, &s;ervants, and labourers, fifty-five women, and four
children. This per&s;evering cruelty appears a&s;toni&s;hing; yet is it much
inferior to what has been practi&s;ed in other countries. A great au|thor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib&punc; 5.</NOTE>computes, that in the Low
Countries alone, from the time that the edict of Charles the fifth was
promulgated again&s;t the reformers, there had been fifty thou&s;and per&s;ons
hanged, beheaded, buried alive, or burnt, on account of reli|gion; 
<PB N="383" REF="387"> and that in France the number had al&s;o been
con&s;iderable. Yet in both countries, as the &s;ame author &s;ubjoins, the
progre&s;s of the new opinions, in&s;tead of being checked, was rather
forwarded by the&s;e per&s;ecutions.</P>
<P>THE burning of heretics was a very natural method of reconciling
the king|dom to the church of Rome, and little &s;ollicitation was requi&s;ite
to engage the pope to receive the &s;trayed flock, from which he reaped &s;uch
profit: Yet was there a &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y &s;ent to Rome, con&s;i&s;ting of
Sir Anthony Brown, created vi&s;count Montacute, the bi&s;hop of Ely, and Sir
Edward Carne; in order to carry the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of England, and beg to be
readmitted into the bo&s;om of the catholic church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 45.</NOTE>. Paul the fourth, after a &s;hort interval,
now filled the papal chair; the mo&s;t haughty pontiff, that during &s;everal
ages had been elevated to that dignity. He was offended, that Mary &s;till
retained among her titles, that of Queen of Ireland; and he affirmed that it
belonged to him alone, as he &s;aw proper, either to erect new kingdoms or
aboli&s;h the old: But to avoid all di&s;pute with the new converts, he thought
proper to erect Ireland into a king|dom, and then admitted the title, as if it
had been his own conce&s;&s;ion. This was an u&s;ual artifice of the popes to
give allowance to what they could not pre|vent<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 45. Father Paul, lib. 5.</NOTE>, and then pretend, that
per&s;ons, while they exerci&s;ed their own power, were only acting by
authority from the papacy. And tho' Paul had at fir&s;t in|tended to oblige
Mary formally to recede from this title, before he would be|&s;tow it upon her;
he found it wi&s;er to proceed in a more political, and le&s;s haughty
manner<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib 5</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE other point of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion between the pope and the
Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors was not &s;o ea&s;ily terminated. Paul in&s;i&s;ted,
that the property and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the church &s;hould be re&s;tored
even to the uttermo&s;t farthing: That whatever be|longed to God, could never
by any law be converted to profane u&s;es, and every per&s;on who detained
&s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions was in a &s;tate of eternal damnation: That he would
willingly, in con&s;ideration of the humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of England, make
them a pre&s;ent of the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues; but &s;uch a
conce&s;&s;ion ex|ceeded his power, and the people might be certain that &s;o
great a profanation of holy things would be a perpetual anathema upon them, and
would bla&s;t all their future felicity: That if they would truly &s;how their
filial piety, they mu&s;t re|&s;tore all the privileges and emoluments of the
Roman church, and Peter's pence among the re&s;t; nor could they expect, that
that apo&s;tle would open to them the gates of Paradi&s;e, while they detained
from them his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on earth<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Father

&s;till in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown; and the more to expre&s;s her

revenue was di&s;membered, the dignity of the crown would fall to decay: But
the Queen replied, that &s;he pre|ferred the &s;alvation of her &s;oul to ten
&s;uch kingdoms as England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 53, 65.

impropriations which remained in the hands of the crown; but tho' this matter
directly concerned none but the Queen her&s;elf, great oppo&s;ition was made to
the bill in the hou&s;e of commons. An application being made for a &s;ub&s;idy
during two years, and for two fifteenths, the latter was refu&s;ed by the
commons; and many members &s;aid, that while the crown was thus de&s;poiling
it&s;elf of its revenues, there was no end of be&s;tow|ing riches upon it. The
Parliament rejected a bill for obliging the exiles to return under certain
penalties, and another for incapacitating &s;uch as were remi&s;s in the
pro&s;ecution of here&s;y from being ju&s;tices of peace. The Queen
finding<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th Decem|ber.</NOTE>the intractable humour of the
commons, thought proper to di&s;&s;olve the Par|liament.</P>
<P>THE &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition, which began to prevail in
Parliament, was likely to be the more vexatious to Mary, as &s;he was
otherwi&s;e in very bad humour on ac|count of her hu&s;band's ab&s;ence, who,
tired of her importunate love and jealou&s;y, and finding his authority
extremely limited in England, had laid hold of the fir&s;t opportunity to leave
her, and had gone over la&s;t &s;ummer to the emperor in Flan|ders. The
indifference and neglect of her hu&s;band, added to the di&s;appoint|ment in
her imagined pregnancy, threw her into a deep melancholy; and &s;he 
<PB N="385" REF="389"> gave vent to her &s;pleen by enforcing daily the
per&s;ecutions again&s;t the prote&s;tants, and even by expre&s;&s;ions of rage
again&s;t all her &s;ubjects, by whom &s;he knew her|&s;elf to be hated, and
who&s;e oppo&s;ition, in refu&s;ing an entire compliance with Philip, was the
cau&s;e, &s;he believed, why he had alienated his affections from her, and
afforded her &s;o little of his company. The le&s;s return her love met with,
the more it increa&s;ed; and &s;he pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of her time in &s;olitude,
where &s;he gave vent to her pa&s;&s;ion, either in tears, or in writing fond
epi&s;tles to Philip, who &s;eldom returned her any an&s;wer, and &s;carce
deigned to counterfeit any &s;entiment of love or even of gratitude towards
her. The chief part of government, to<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's
extortions.</NOTE>which &s;he attended, was the extorting money from her
people, in order to &s;atisfy his demands; and as the Parliament had granted
her but a &s;mall &s;upply, &s;he had recour&s;e to expedients the mo&s;t
violent and mo&s;t irregular. She levied a loan of 60,000 pounds upon a
thou&s;and per&s;ons, of who&s;e compliance, either on account of their riches
or their affections to her, &s;he held her&s;elf be&s;t a&s;&s;ured: But that
&s;um not &s;ufficing, &s;he exacted a general loan of an hundred pounds
a|piece on every one who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed twenty pounds a year. This grievous
impo|&s;ition lay very heavy on the gentry, who were obliged, many of them, to
re|trench their expences, and di&s;mi&s;s their &s;ervants, in order to enable
them to comply with her commands: And as the&s;e &s;ervants, accu&s;tomed to
idlene&s;s, and having no means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, betook them&s;elves very
commonly to theft and robbery, the Queen publi&s;hed a proclamation, by which
&s;he obliged their former ma&s;ters to take them back to their &s;ervice. She
levied 60,000 marks from 7000 yeomen, who had not contributed to the former
loan; and &s;he exacted 36,000 pounds more from the merchants. In order to
engage &s;ome Londoners to comply the more willingly with her multiplied

ab&s;olved them from all oaths of allegiance, and devolving his authority on
Philip, told him, that his paternal tender|ne&s;s made him weep, when he
reflected on the burthen which he impo&s;ed upon him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thuan. lib. XVI. c. 20.</NOTE>. He inculcated to him the great and
only duty of a prince, the &s;tudy of his people's happine&s;s; and
repre&s;ented how much preferable it was to govern, by affection rather than
fear, the nations &s;ubjected to his dominion. The cool reflections of age now
di&s;covered to him the emptine&s;s of his former pur&s;uits; and he found,
that the vain &s;chemes of extending his empire had been the &s;ource of
endle&s;s oppo&s;ition and di&s;appointment, had kept him&s;elf, his
neighbours, and his &s;ubjects in perpetual inquietude, and had fru&s;trated
the &s;ole end of government, the felicity of the nations committed to his

greate&s;t beauties of nature, he had cho&s;en for the place of his retreat. 
<PB N="387" REF="391"> When he arrived at Burgos, he found, by the thinne&s;s
of his court, and the ne|gligent attendance of the Spani&s;h grandees, that he
was no longer emperor; and tho' this ob&s;ervation might convince him &s;till
more of the vanity of the world, and make him more heartily de&s;pi&s;e what he
had renounced, he &s;ighed to find that all the former adulation and
obei&s;ance had been paid to his fortune, not to his per&s;on. With better
rea&s;on, was he &s;truck with the ingratitude of his &s;on Philip, who allowed
him to wait a long time for the payment of the &s;mall pen&s;ion which he had
re&s;erved; and this di&s;appointment in his dome&s;tic enjoy|ments gave him a
very &s;en&s;ible concern. He pur&s;ued however his re&s;olution with
inflexible con&s;tancy; and &s;hutting him&s;elf up in his retreat, he exerted
&s;uch &s;elf|command, that he re&s;trained even his curio&s;ity from any
enquiry concerning the tran&s;actions of the world, which he had entirely
abandoned. The fencing again&s;t the pains and infirmities under which he
laboured, occupied a great part of his time; and during the intervals, he
employed his lei&s;ure either in examin|ing the controver&s;ies of theology,
with which his age had been &s;o much agitated, and which he had hitherto
con&s;idered only in a political light, or in imitating the works of renowned
arti&s;ts, particularly in mechanics, of which he had always been a great
admirer and encourager. He is &s;aid to have here di&s;covered a propen&s;ity
to the new doctrines; and to have frequently dropped hints of this unexpected
alteration in his &s;entiments. Having amu&s;ed him&s;elf with the
con|&s;truction of clocks and watches, he thence remarked how impracticable the
ob|ject was, in which he had &s;o much employed him&s;elf during his grandeur;
and how impo&s;&s;ible that he, who never could frame two machines that would
go exactly alike, could ever be able to make all mankind concur in the &s;ame
belief and opinion. He &s;urvived his retreat two years.</P>
<P>THE emperor Charles had very early, in the beginning of his
reign, found the difficulty of governing &s;uch di&s;tant dominions; and he had
made his brother Ferdinand be elected King of the Romans; with a view of his
&s;ucceeding to the imperial dignity, as well as to his German dominions. But
having afterwards enlarged his views, and formed plans of aggrandizing his
family, he regreted, that he mu&s;t di&s;member &s;uch con&s;iderable &s;tates;
and he endeavoured to engage Ferdinand, by the mo&s;t tempting offers, and
mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;ollicitations, to yield up his preten&s;ions in favour of
Philip. Finding his attempts fruitle&s;s, he had re&s;igned the imperial crown
with his other dignities; and Ferdinand, according to common form, applied to
the pope for his coronation. The arrogant pontiff refu&s;ed the demand; and
pretended, that, tho', on the death of an emperor, he was obliged to crown the
prince elected, yet in the ca&s;e of a re&s;ignation, the right devolved to the
holy &s;ee, and it belonged to the pope alone to appoint an 
<PB N="388" REF="392"> emperor. The conduct of Paul was in every thing
conformable to the&s;e lofty preten&s;ions. He thundered always in the ears of
all amba&s;&s;adors, that he &s;tood in no need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any
prince, that he was above all pote tates of the earth, that he would not
accu&s;tom monarchs to pretend to a familiarity or equality with him, that it
belonged to him to alter and regulate kingdoms, that he was &s;ucce&s;&s;or of
tho&s;e who had depo&s;ed kings and emperors, and that, rather than &s;ubmit to
any thing below his dignity, he would &s;et fire to the four corners of the
world. He went &s;o far, that at table, in the pre&s;ence of many per&s;ons,
and even openly, in a public con&s;i&s;tory, he &s;aid, that he would not admit
any Kings for his companions; they were all his &s;ubjects, and he would hold
them under the&s;e feet: So &s;aying, he &s;tamped the ground with his old and
infirm limbs: For he was now pa&s;t four&s;core years of age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE world could not forbear making a compari&s;on between
Charles the fifth, a prince, who, tho' educated amid&s;t wars and intrigues of
&s;tate, had prevented the decline of age, and had de&s;cended from the throne,
in order to &s;et apart an interval for thought and reflection, and a prie&s;t,
who in the extremity of old age exulted in his dominion, and from re&s;tle&s;s
ambition and revenge was throwing all nations into combu&s;tion. Paul had
entertained the mo&s;t inveterate animo&s;ity again&s;t the hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria; and tho' a truce of five years had been concluded between France and
Spain, he excited Henry by his &s;ollicitations to break it, and promi&s;ed to
a&s;&s;i&s;t him in recovering Naples and the dominions to which he laid claim
in Italy; a project which had ever proved fatal to his prede|ce&s;&s;ors. He
him&s;elf engaged in ho&s;tilities with the duke of Alva, viceroy of Naples;
and the duke of Gui&s;e being &s;ent with forces to &s;upport him, the re|newal
of war between the two crowns &s;eemed almo&s;t inevitable. Philip, tho' le&s;s
warlike than his father, was no le&s;s ambitious; and he tru&s;ted, that by the
in|trigues of the cabinet, where, he believed, his caution and &s;ecrecy and
prudence gave him the &s;uperiority, he &s;hould be able to &s;ubdue all his
enemies, and extend his authority and dominion. For this rea&s;on, as well as
from the de&s;ire of &s;et|tling his new empire, he was de&s;irous to maintain
peace with France; but when he found, that, without &s;acrificing his honour,
it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to over|look the ho&s;tile attempts of Henry, he
prepared for war with great indu&s;try. In order to give him&s;elf the more
advantage, he was de&s;irous to embark England in the quarrel; and tho' the
Queen was of her&s;elf extremely aver&s;e to that de|&s;ign, he hoped, that the
devoted fondne&s;s, which, notwith&s;tanding repeated in|&s;tances of his
indifference, &s;he &s;till bore him, would effectually &s;econd his
applica|tions. Had the matter indeed depended &s;olely on her, &s;he was
incapable of re|&s;i&s;ting <PB N="389" REF="393"> her hu&s;band's commands;
but &s;he had little weight with her council, &s;till le&s;s with her people;
and her government, which was every day becoming more odious, &s;eemed unable
to &s;upport it&s;elf even during the mo&s;t profound tranquillity, much more
if a war was kindled with France, and what &s;eemed an inevitable
con&s;equence, with Scotland, &s;upported by that powerful kingdom.</P>
<P>AN act of barbarity was this year exerci&s;ed in England, which,
added to many other in&s;tances of the &s;ame kind, tended to render the
government extremely unpopular. Cranmer had long been detained a pri&s;oner;
but the Queen was now<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of Cranmer.</NOTE>determined
to bring him to puni&s;hment; and in order the more fully to &s;atiate her
vengeance, &s;he re&s;olved to puni&s;h him for here&s;y, rather than for
trea&s;on. He was cited by the pope to &s;tand his trial at Rome; and tho' he
was known to be kept in clo&s;e cu&s;tody at Oxford, he was, upon his not
appearing, condemned as contumacious. Bonner, bi&s;hop of London, and Thirleby
of Ely, were &s;ent down to Oxford to degrade him; and the former executed that
melancholy ceremony with all the joy and exultation, which &s;uited his
&s;avage nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. of Cranm p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>. The revenge of the
Queen, not &s;atisfied with the eternal damnation of Cranmer, which &s;he
believed inevitable, and with the execution of that dreadful &s;entence to
which he was condemned, prompted her al&s;o to &s;eek the ruin of his honour,
and the infamy of his name. Per&s;ons were employed to attack him, not in the
way of di&s;putation, again&s;t which he was &s;ufficiently armed; but by
flattery, in&s;inuation and addre&s;s; by repre&s;enting the dignities to which
his character &s;till entitled him, if he would merit them by a recantation; by
giving hopes of long enjoying tho&s;e powerful friends, whom his beneficent
di&s;po&s;ition had attached to him during the cour&s;e of his
pro&s;perity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p

pro&s;pect of tho&s;e tortures which awaited him; he allowed, in an unguarded
hour, the &s;entiments of nature to prevail over his re&s;olution, and he
agreed to &s;ign a paper, in which he acknowledged the doctrines of the papal
&s;upre|macy and of the real pre&s;ence. The court, equally per&s;idious and
cruel, were deter|mined, that this recantation &s;hould avail him nothing; and
they &s;ent orders, that he &s;hould be required to acknowledge his errors in
church before the whole people, and that he &s;hould thence be immediately led
to execution. Cranmer, whether, that he had received a &s;ecret intimation of
their de&s;ign, or had repented<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t March.</NOTE>of his weakne&s;s, &s;urprized the
audience by a contrary declaration. He &s;aid, that he was well apprized of the
obedience which he owed his sovereign and the laws, but this duty extended no
farther than to &s;ubmit patiently to their commands, and to bear without
re&s;i&s;tance whatever hard&s;hips they &s;hould impo&s;e upon him: That a
&s;uperior duty, the duly which he owed his Maker, obliged him to &s;peak 
<PB N="390" REF="394"> truth on all occa&s;ions, and not to relinqui&s;h, by a
ba&s;e denial, the holy doctrine which the &s;upreme being had revealed to
mankind: That there was one mi&s;car|riage in his life, of which, above all
others, he &s;everely repented; the in&s;incere declaration of faith to which
he had the weakne&s;s to con&s;ent, and which the fear of death alone had
extorted from him: That he took this opportunity of attoning for his error, by
a &s;incere and open recantation; and was willing to &s;eal with his blood that
doctrine which he firmly believed to be communicated from heaven: And that as
his hand had erred by betraying his heart, it &s;hould fir&s;t be puni&s;hed,
by a &s;evere but ju&s;t doom, and &s;hould fir&s;t pay the forfeit of its
of|fences. He was thence led to the &s;take amid&s;t the in&s;ults of the
catholics; and hav|ing now &s;ummoned up all the force of his mind, he bore
their &s;corn as well as the torture of his puni&s;hment with &s;ingular
fortitude. He &s;tretched out his hand, and without betraying, either by his
countenance or motions, the lea&s;t &s;ign of weakne&s;s or even of feeling, he
held it in the flames till it was entirely con&s;umed. His thoughts &s;eemed
entirely occupied with reflections on his former fault; and he called aloud
&s;everal times, <HI>This hand has offended.</HI> Satisfied with that
attonement, he then di&s;co|vered a &s;erenity in his countenance; and when the
fire attacked his body, he &s;eemed to be wholly in&s;en&s;ible of his outward
&s;ufferings, and by the force of hope and re&s;o|lution to have collected his
mind altogether within it&s;elf, and to repel the fury of the flames. It is
pretended, that, after his body was con&s;umed, his heart was found entire and
untouched among the a&s;hes; an event, which, as it was the emblem of his
con&s;tancy, was fondly believed by the zealous prote&s;tants. He was
undoubtedly a man of merit; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of learning and capacity; and
adorned with candour, &s;in|cerity and beneficence, and all tho&s;e virtues,
which were fitted to render him u&s;eful and amiable in &s;ociety. His moral
qualities procured him univer&s;al re|&s;pect; and the courage of his
martyrdom, tho' he fell &s;hort of the rigid inflexi|bility ob&s;erved in many,
made him the hero of the prote&s;tant party<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet,

<P>AFTER Cranmer's death, cardinal Pole, who had now taken

this office, as well as his commi&s;&s;ion of legate, placed at the head of the
church of England. But tho' he was aver&s;e to all the &s;anguinary methods of
converting heretics, and e&s;teemed the reformation of the clergy the more
effectual, as the more laudable expedient for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. 324, 325.</NOTE>; he found his authority too weak
to oppo&s;e the barbarous and bigot|ted di&s;po&s;ition of the Queen and of her
coun&s;ellors. He him&s;elf, he knew, had been &s;u&s;pected of Lutherani&s;m;
and as Paul, the reigning pope, was a furious per|&s;ecutor and his per&s;onal
enemy, he was prompted, by the mode&s;ty of his di&s;po|&s;ition,

<P><MILESTONE N="1557" UNIT="year"> THE great object of the Queen
was to engage the nation in the war, which was kindled between France and
Spain; and cardinal Pole, with many other coun&s;ellors, very openly and
zealou&s;ly oppo&s;ed this mea&s;ure. Be&s;ides in&s;i&s;ting on the marriage
articles, which provided again&s;t &s;uch an attempt, they repre&s;ented the
violence of the dome&s;tic factions in England, and the di&s;ordered &s;tate of
the finances; and they foreboded, that the tendency of all the&s;e mea&s;ures
was to re|duce the kingdom to a total dependance on Spani&s;h councils. Philip
had come to London in order to &s;upport his partizans; and he told the Queen,
that, if he was not gratified in &s;o rea&s;onable a reque&s;t, he never more
would &s;et foot in England. This declaration heightened extremely her zeal for
promoting his intere&s;ts, and overcoming the inflexibility of her council.
After employing other menaces of a more violent nature, &s;he threatened to
di&s;mi&s;s them all from the board, and to appoint coun&s;ellors more
ob&s;equious; yet could &s;he not procure a vote for declaring war with France.
At la&s;t, one Stafford and &s;ome other con&s;pirators were de|tected in a
de&s;ign of &s;urprizing Scarborow<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p.
72. Burnet, vol II. p 351. Sir James Melvil's Memoirs.</NOTE>; and a
confe&s;&s;ion being extorted from them, that they had been encouraged by Henry
in that attempt, the Queen's importunity prevailed; and it was determined to
make this act of ho&s;tility, with others of a like &s;ecret and doubtful
nature, the ground of the quarrel. War<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with
France.</NOTE>was accordingly declared again&s;t France; and preparations were
every where made for attacking that kingdom.</P>
<P>THE revenue of England at that time little exceeded 300,000
pounds<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ro&s;&s;e, Succe&s;&s;i d'Inglulte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ra.</NOTE>. Any con&s;iderable
&s;upplies could &s;carce be expected from Parliament, con&s;idering the
pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the nation; and as the war would &s;en&s;ibly
dimini&s;h the branch of the cu&s;toms, the finances, it was fore&s;een, would
fall &s;hort even of the ordinary charges of the government; much more, prove
unequal to the va&s;t expences of war. But tho' the Queen owed great arrears to
all her &s;ervants, be&s;ides the loans extorted from her &s;ubjects; the&s;e
con&s;iderations had no influ|ence on her, and &s;he continued to levy money in
the &s;ame arbitrary and violent manner, which &s;he had formerly practi&s;ed.
She obliged the city of London to &s;upply her with 60,000 pounds on her
hu&s;band's entry; &s;he levied before the legal time the &s;econd year's
&s;ub&s;idy voted by Parliament; &s;he i&s;&s;ued anew many privy &s;eals, by
which &s;he procured loans from her people; and having equiped 
<PB N="392" REF="396"> a fleet, which &s;he could not victual by rea&s;on of
the dearne&s;s of provi&s;ions, &s;he &s;eized all the corn &s;he could find in
Suffolk and Norfolk, without paying any price to the owners. By all the&s;e
expedients, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the power of pre&s;&s;ing, &s;he levied an army
of ten thou&s;and men, which &s;he &s;ent over to the Low Coun|tries, under the
command of the earl of Pembroke. Meanwhile, in order to prevent any
di&s;turbance at home, many of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable gentry were thrown
into the Tower; and le&s;t they &s;hould be known, the Spani&s;h practice was
followed: They were either carried thither in the night-time, or were
hood|winked and muffled by the guards who conducted them<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Strype's Eccle&s;. Memorials, vol. III. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King of Spain had a&s;&s;embled together an army, which,
after the junction of the Engli&s;h, amounted to above &s;ixty thou&s;and
&s;trong, commanded by Philibert, duke of Savoy, one of the greate&s;t captains
of the age. The con&s;table, Montmo|rency, who commanded the French army, had
not half the number to oppo&s;e him. The duke of Savoy, after menacing
Mariembourg and Rocroy, &s;at down &s;uddenly before St. Quintin; and as the
place was weak, and ill provided of a garri&s;on, he expected in a few days to
become ma&s;ter of it. But the admiral Coligny, governor of the province,
thinking his honour intere&s;ted to &s;ave &s;o im|portant a fortre&s;s, threw
him&s;elf into St. Quintin, with &s;ome troops of French and Scotch
gen&s;darmes; and by his exhortation and example animated the &s;ol|diers to a
vigorous defence. He di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to his uncle, the
con|&s;table, de&s;iring a &s;upply of men; and that general approached the
place with his<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Augu&s;t.</NOTE>whole army, in order to
facilitate the entry of the&s;e &s;uccours. But the duke of Savoy falling on
the reinforcement, committed &s;uch &s;laughter upon them, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of St. Quintin.</NOTE>not above five hundred men got into
the place. He next made an attack on the French army, and put them to a total
rout, killing four thou&s;and men, and di&s;per&s;ing the re&s;t. In this
unfortunate action many of the chief nobility of France were either &s;lain or
taken pri&s;oners: Among the latter was the old con|&s;table him&s;elf, who
fighting valiantly, and re&s;olute to die rather than &s;urvive his defeat, was
&s;urrounded by the enemy, and thus fell alive into their hands. The whole
kingdom of France was thrown into con&s;ternation. Paris was attempted to be
fortified in a hurry: And had the Spaniards pre&s;ently marched thither, it
could not fail to have fallen into their hands. But Philip was very little
enter|prizing in his character; and he was determined fir&s;t to take St.
Quintin, in or|der to &s;ecure a communication with his own dominions. A very
little time, it was expected, would fini&s;h this enterprize; but the bravery
of Coligny &s;till pro|longed the &s;iege &s;eventeen days, which proved the
&s;afety of France. Some <PB N="393" REF="397"> troops were levied and
a&s;&s;embled. Couriers were &s;ent to call the duke of Gui&s;e and his army
from Italy: And the French having recovered from their fir&s;t alarm, put
them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence. Philip, after taking Ham and
Ca&s;telet, found the &s;ea&s;on &s;o far advanced, that he could attempt no
farther en|terprize, and he broke up his camp and retired to winter
quarters.</P>
<P>BUT the vigilant activity of Gui&s;e, not &s;atisfied with
&s;ecuring the frontiers, prompted him, in the depth of winter, to attempt an
enterprize which France, during her greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es, had always
regarded as impo&s;&s;ible, and had never thought of undertaking. Calais was,
in that age, e&s;teemed an impregnable for|tre&s;s; and as it was known to be
the favourite of the Engli&s;h nation, by whom it could ea&s;ily be
&s;uccoured, the recovery of that place by France, was con&s;idered as totally
de&s;perate. But Coligny had remarked, that, as the town of Calais was
&s;urrounded with mar&s;hes, which, during the winter, were impa&s;&s;able,
except<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calais taken by the French.</NOTE>over a dyke guarded
by two ca&s;tles, St. Agatha and Newnam bridge, the Eng|li&s;h were of late
accu&s;tomed, on account of the lowne&s;s of their finances, to di&s;|mi&s;s a
great part of the garri&s;on at the end of autumn, and to recall them in the
&s;pring, at which time alone they judged their attendance nece&s;&s;ary. On
this circum&s;tance he had founded his de&s;ign of making a &s;udden attack on
the place; he had cau&s;ed it to be &s;ecretly &s;urveyed by &s;ome engineers;
and a plan of the whole enterprize being found among his papers, it &s;erved,
tho' he him&s;elf was made pri|&s;oner on the taking of St. Quintin, to
&s;ugge&s;t the project of that undertaking, and to direct the conduct of the
duke of Gui&s;e.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1558" UNIT="year"> SEVERAL bodies of troops
defiled towards the frontiers under various pre|tences; and the whole being
&s;uddenly a&s;&s;embled, formed an army with which the duke of Gui&s;e made an
unexpected march towards Calais. At the &s;ame time a great number of French
&s;hips, being ordered&punc; into the channel, under colour of cruizing on the
Engli&s;h, compo&s;ed a fleet which made an attack by &s;ea on the
fortifications. The French a&s;&s;aulted St. Agatha with three thou&s;and
harquebu|&s;iers; and tho' the garri&s;on made a vigorous defence, they were
&s;oon obliged to abandon the place, and retreat towards Newnam bridge. The
&s;iege of this latter place was immediately undertaken, and at the &s;ame time
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">leet battered the ri&s;bank,
which guarded the entry of the harbour; and both the&s;e ca&s;tles &s;eemed
expo&s;ed to imminent danger. The governor, lord Wentworth, was a brave
officer, but finding that the greater part of his weak garri&s;on was
enclo&s;ed in Newnam or the ri&s;bank, he ordered them to capitulate, and to
join him in Calais, which, without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he was utterly
unable to defend. The garri&s;on of Newnam bridge were &s;o happy as to
effectuate this purpo&s;e; but that of the ri&s;|bank <PB N="394" REF="398">
could not obtain &s;uch favourable conditions, and were obliged to &s;urrender
them&s;elves pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>THE duke of Gui&s;e, now holding the place blockaded by &s;ea
and land, thought him&s;elf &s;ecure of &s;ucceeding in his enterprize; but in
order to prevent all acci|dents, he delayed not a moment the attack of the
place. He pointed his batteries towards the ca&s;tle, where he made a large
breach; and having ordered Andelot, Coligny's brother, to drain the
fo&s;&s;&eacute;e, he commanded an a&s;&s;ault, which &s;ucceeded, and the
French made a lodgment in the ca&s;tle. On the night following Went|worth
attempted to recover this po&s;t; but having lo&s;t two hundred men in a
fu|rious attack which he made upon it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thuan, lib. xx.
c. 2.</NOTE>, he found his garri&s;on &s;o weak, that he was obliged to
capitulate. Ham, and Gui&s;nes fell &s;oon after; and thus the duke of Gui&s;e,
in eight days, during the depth of winter, recovered this important place, that
had co&s;t Edward the third a &s;iege of eleven months, at the head of a
numerous army, which had that very campaign been victorious in the battle of
Cre&s;&s;y. The Engli&s;h had held it above two hundred years; and as it gave
them, whenever they plea&s;ed, an entry into France, it was regarded as the
mo&s;t important po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion belonging to the crown. The joy of the
French was extreme, as well as the glory acquired by the duke of Gui&s;e, who,
at the time that all Europe ima|gined France to be &s;unk by the unfortunate
battle of St. Quintin, had, in oppo|&s;ition to the Engli&s;h, and their allies
the Spaniards, acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a place which no former King of
France, even during the di&s;tractions of the civil wars between the hou&s;es
of York and Lanca&s;ter, had ever ventured to attempt. The Engli&s;h, on the
other hand, bereaved of this valuable fortre&s;s, murmured loud|ly again&s;t
the imprudence of the Queen and her council; who, after engaging in a
fruitle&s;s war, for the &s;ake of foreign intere&s;ts, had thus expo&s;ed the
nation to &s;o &s;evere a di&s;grace. A trea&s;ury exhau&s;ted by expences, and
burthened with debts; a people divided and dejected; a &s;overeign negligent of
her people's welfare; were circum&s;tances which, notwith&s;tanding the fair
offers made by Philip, gave them &s;mall hopes of recovering Calais. And as the
Scotch, in&s;tigated by French councils, began to move on the borders, they
were now nece&s;&s;itated rather to look to their defence at home, than to
think of foreign conque&s;ts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> AFTER the peace,
which, in con&s;equence of King Edward's treaty with Henry, took place between
Scotland and England, the Queen-dowager, under pretence of vi&s;iting her

with her the earls of Huntley, Sutherland, Mari&s;chal, and many of the
principal nobility. Her &s;ecret de&s;ign was to take mea&s;ures for engaging
the earl of Arran to re&s;ign to her the government of the kingdom; and as her 
<PB N="395" REF="399"> brothers, the duke of Gui&s;e, the cardinal of Lorraine,
and the duke d'Aumale, had uncontrouled authority in the court of France, &s;he
ea&s;ily per&s;uaded Henry, and by his means the Scotch nobles, to enter into
her mea&s;ures. Having al&s;o gained over Carnegy of Kinnaird, Panter, bi&s;hop
of Ro&s;s, and Gavin Hamilton, com|mendator of Kilwinning, three creatures of
the governor's, &s;he per&s;uaded him, by their means, to con&s;ent to this

and when every thing was thus prepared for her purpo&s;e, &s;he took her
journey to Scotland, and pa&s;&s;ed thro' England in her way thither. Edward
received her with great re&s;pect and civility; tho' he could not forbear
attempting a renewal of the old treaty for his marriage with her daughter: A
marriage, he &s;aid, &s;o happily calculated for the tranquillity, intere&s;t,
and &s;ecurity of both kingdoms, and the only means of en&s;uring a durable
peace between them. For his part, he added, he never could entertain a cordial
amity for any other hu&s;band whom &s;he &s;hould choo&s;e; nor was it ea&s;y
for him to forgive a man, who, at the &s;ame time that he di&s;appointed &s;o
natural an alliance, had bereaved him of a bride, to whom his affections, from
his earlie&s;t infancy, had been entirely engaged. The Queen eluded the&s;e
applications, by telling him, that if any mea&s;ures had been taken
di&s;agreeable to him, they were entirely owing to the imprudence of the duke
of Somer&s;et, who, in&s;tead of employing courte&s;y, care&s;&s;es, and gentle
offices, the proper means of gaining a young prince&s;s, had had recour&s;e to
arms and violence, and had con&s;trained the Scotch nobility to &s;end their

<P>WHEN the Queen-dowager arrived in Scotland, &s;he found the
governor very unwilling to fulfil his engagements; and it was not till after
many delays that he could be per&s;uaded to re&s;ign his authority. But finding
that the majority of the young prince&s;s was approaching, and that the
Queen-dowager had gained the affections of all the principal nobility, he
thought it more prudent to &s;ubmit; and having &s;tipulated, that he &s;hould
be declared next heir to the crown, and &s;hould be fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d from giving any account of his pa&s;t
admini&s;tration, he placed her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the power; and &s;he
thenceforth a&s;&s;umed the name of regent<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> April 1554.</NOTE>. It was an
u&s;ual &s;aying of this prince&s;s, that provided &s;he could render her
friends happy, and could en&s;ure to her&s;elf a good reputation, &s;he was
entirely indifferent what be&s;el her; and tho' this &s;entiment is greatly
cen&s;ured by the zealous reformers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> p. 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>, as being founded wholly on &s;ecular motives,
it di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">overs a mind well
calculated for the admini&s;tration of kingdoms. D'Oi&s;el, a Frenchman,
celebrated for capacity, had attended her as amba&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">dor from Henry, but in <PB N="396" REF="400"> reality to
a&s;&s;i&s;t her with his coun&s;els in &s;o delicate an undertaking as the
govern|ment of Scotland; and this man had formed a &s;cheme for laying a
general tax on the kingdom, in order to &s;upport a &s;tanding military force,
which might at once repul&s;e the inroads of foreign enemies, and check the
turbulence of the Scotch nobility. But tho' &s;ome of the courtiers were gained
over to this project, it gave great and general di&s;content to the nation; and
the Queen-regent, after ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ing, that it would prove
pernicious to the kingdom, had the prudence to de&s;i&s;t from it, and to
tru&s;t entirely for her &s;ecurity to the good|will and affections of her
&s;ubjects<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 70. Buchan. lib.

<P>THIS laudable purpo&s;e &s;eemed to be the chief object of her
admini&s;tration; yet was &s;he &s;ometimes drawn from it by her connections
with France, and by the influence which her brothers had acquired over her.
When Mary declared war again&s;t that kingdom, Henry required the Queen-regent
to take part in the quarrel; and &s;he &s;ummoned a convention of &s;tates at
Newbottle, and reque&s;ted them to concur in a declaration of war again&s;t
England. The Scotch nobles, who were as jealous of French as the Engli&s;h were
of Spani&s;h influence, refu&s;ed their a&s;&s;ent; and the Queen was obliged
to have recour&s;e to artifice, in order to effectuate her purpo&s;e. She
ordered d'Oi&s;el to begin &s;ome fortifications at Eymouth, a place which had
been di&s;mantled by the la&s;t treaty with Edward; and when the garri&s;on of
Berwic, as &s;he fore&s;aw, made an inroad to prevent the undertaking, &s;he
effectually employed this pretence to inflame the Scotch nation, and to engage
them in ho&s;tilities again&s;t England<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Buchan.
lib. xvi. Thuan. lib. xix. c. 7.</NOTE>. The enterprize, however, of the Scotch
proceeded no farther than &s;ome inroads on the borders; and when d'Oi&s;el, of

he was recalled, and very &s;harply rebuked by the council<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 93.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the dauphin and the Queen of
Scots.</NOTE> IN order to connect Scotland more clo&s;ely with France, and to
increa&s;e the influence of the latter kingdom, it was thought proper by Henry
to compleat the marriage between the young Queen and the dauphin; and a
deputation was &s;ent by the Scotch Parliament, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at this
ceremony, and to &s;ettle the terms of the contract. This deputation
con&s;i&s;ted of the archbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, the bi|&s;hops of Ro&s;s and
the Orkneys, the earls of Rothes, and Ca&s;&s;ilis, the lords Fleming and
Seton, James Stuart, prior of St. Andrews, natural brother to the Queen, and
Er&s;kine of Dun. The principal conditions recommended to the&s;e
commi&s;&s;ioners, was to obtain a &s;olemn engagement from the Queen and
dauphin, that they would pre&s;erve the laws and privileges of Scotland, and to
procure a renewal of the French King's promi&s;e, to &s;upport, in ca&s;e of
the Queen's death, <PB N="397" REF="401"> the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the earl of
Arran, now created duke of Chatolraut. Both the&s;e conditions were ea&s;ily
obtained; but the court of France took a very perfidious &s;tep, directly
contrary to the&s;e &s;tipulations: They &s;ecretly engaged the young Queen to
&s;ign three papers; by one of which &s;he made over the kingdom of Scotland in
gift to the King of France, in ca&s;e of her decea&s;e without children; by
another &s;he mortgaged it to him for a million of crowns of gold, or &s;uch
greater &s;um as he &s;hould have expended for her maintenance and &s;upport;
and by a third &s;he declared, that whatever deed &s;he had been obliged, or
&s;hould hereafter be obliged to perform, relative to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
the crown, it &s;hould be entirely invalid, and that her real &s;en&s;e and
intention was contained in the fir&s;t paper. The marriage was
&s;o|lemnized<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 April.</NOTE>at Paris: The
commi&s;&s;ioners, in the name of the &s;tates of Scotland, &s;wore allegiance
to the Queen, and, during the continuance of the marriage, to the King-dauphin,
&s;o he was called: And every thing &s;eemed to proceed with great unanimity
and concord. But the commi&s;&s;ioners being required to deli|ver up the crown,
and other en&s;igns of royalty, made an&s;wer, that they had received no
authority for that purpo&s;e; and they &s;oon after &s;et out on their journey
for Scotland. It is remarkable, that before they embarked, four of the
commi&s;&s;ioners died, within a few days of each other; and a violent, tho'
ab&s;urd &s;u&s;picion prevailed, that they had been poi&s;oned by orders from
the family of Gui&s;e, on account of this refu&s;al<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchan. lib. xvi. Keith, p. 75. Spot&s;wood, p. 95.</NOTE>. It was
not con&s;idered, that that accident, however rare, might have happened by the
cour&s;e of nature; and that the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on, tho' not attended with
any pe&s;tilential di&s;order, was, to a &s;ingular degree, unhealthy all over
Europe.</P>
<P>THE clo&s;e alliance between France and Scotland threatned very
nearly the re|po&s;e and &s;ecurity of England; and it was fore&s;een, that,
tho' the factions and di&s;or|ders which might naturally be expected in the
Scotch government during the ab&s;ence of their &s;overeign, made its power
le&s;s formidable, that kingdom would at lea&s;t af|ford to the French a means
of invading England. The Queen, therefore, found it<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th
January&punc;</NOTE>nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ummon a Parliament, and to demand of
them &s;ome &s;upplies to her ex|hau&s;ted<NOTE PLACE="marg">A
Parliament.</NOTE>exchequer. As &s;uch an emergency u&s;ually gives great
advantage to the people, and as the Parliaments, during this reign, had
&s;hewn, that, where the liberty and independency of the kingdom were menaced
with imminent danger, they were not entirely overawed by the court; we &s;hall
naturally expect, that the late arbi|trary methods of extorting money &s;hould,
at lea&s;t, be cen&s;ured, and, perhaps, &s;ome remedy be for the future
provided again&s;t them. But &s;uch an exorbitant prerogative was at this time
acknowleged to belong to the crown, that, tho' men might complain of its
pre&s;ent abu&s;es, all attempts to retrench it would have been 
<PB N="398" REF="402"> regarded as the mo&s;t criminal enterprize; and as that
prerogative involved a large di&s;cretionary power, any parliamentary enquiry
into its exerci&s;e, would have pa&s;&s;ed for in&s;olent and pre&s;umptuous.
The commons, therefore, without making any reflections on the pa&s;t, voted,
be&s;ides a fifteenth, a &s;ub&s;idy of four &s;hillings in the pound on land,
and two &s;hillings and eight pence on goods. The clergy granted eight
&s;hillings in the pound, payable in four years by equal portions.</P>
<P>THE Parliament al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed an act, confirming all the
&s;ales and grants of crown lands, which were either made already by the Queen,
or &s;hould be made during the &s;even en&s;uing years. It was ea&s;y to
fore&s;ee, that, in the Queen's pre&s;ent di&s;|po&s;ition and &s;ituation,
this power would be followed by a great alienation of the crown lands; and
nothing could be more contrary to the principles of good go|vernment, than a
prince armed with very exten&s;ive authority, and yet reduced to beggary. This
act met with oppo&s;ition in the hou&s;e of commons. One Copley expre&s;&s;ed
his fears le&s;t the Queen, under colour of the power there granted, might
alienate the crown from the lawful heir: But his words were thought
<HI>irreverent</HI> to her maje&s;ty: He was committed to the cu&s;tody of the
&s;erjeant at arms; and tho' he expre&s;&s;ed &s;orrow for his offence, he was
not relea&s;ed till the Queen was applied to for his forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h nation, during this whole reign, were in continual
apprehen&s;ions with regard not only to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but the life of
the lady Elizabeth. The violent hatred which the Queen bore her, broke out on
every occa&s;ion; and it required all the authority of Philip, as well as her
own great prudence, to prevent the fatal effects of it. The prince&s;s retired
into the country; and knowing that &s;he was &s;urrounded with &s;pies, &s;he
pa&s;t her time wholly in reading and &s;tudy, intermed|dled in no
bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;aw very little company. While &s;he remained in this
&s;itua|tion, which was for the pre&s;ent very melancholy, but which prepared
her mind for tho&s;e great actions by which her life was afterwards &s;o much
di&s;tingui&s;hed; pro|po&s;als of marriage were made her by the Swedi&s;h
amba&s;&s;ador, in his ma&s;ter's name. As her fir&s;t que&s;tion was, whether
the Queen had been informed of this propo&s;al; the amba&s;&s;ador told her,
that his ma&s;ter thought, as he was a gentle|man, it was his duty fir&s;t to
make his addre&s;&s;es to her&s;elf; and having obtained her con&s;ent, he
would next, as a King, apply to her &s;i&s;ter. But the prince&s;s would allow
him to proceed no further; and the Queen, after thanking her for this
in&s;tance of duty, de&s;ired to know how &s;he &s;tood affected to the
Swedi&s;h pro|po&s;al. Elizabeth, tho' expo&s;ed to many pre&s;ent dangers and
mortifications, had the magnanimity to re&s;erve her&s;elf to better fortune;
and &s;he covered her refu&s;al with profe&s;&s;ions of a pa&s;&s;ionate
attachment to a &s;ingle life, which, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he <PB N="399" REF="403"> infinitely preferred before any other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. Collect. N^o 37.</NOTE>. The prince&s;s &s;howed
like prudence in concealing her &s;entiments of religion, in complying with the
pre&s;ent modes of wor&s;hip, and in eluding all que&s;tions with regard to
that delicate &s;ubject<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">

<P>THE money granted by Parliament, enabled the Queen to fit out a
fleet of a hundred and forty &s;ail, which, being joined by thirty Flemi&s;h
&s;hips, and carry|ing &s;ix thou&s;and land forces on board, was &s;ent to
make an attempt on the coa&s;t of Brittany. The fleet was commanded by lord
Clinton; the land forces by the earls of Huntingdon and Rutland. But the
equipment of the fleet and army was &s;o dilatory, that the French got
intelligence of the de&s;ign, and were prepared to receive them. The Engli&s;h
found Bre&s;t too well guarded to make an attempt on that place; but landing at
Conquet, they plundered and burnt the town with &s;ome adjoining villages, and
were proceeding to commit greater di&s;orders, when Ker&s;imon, a Breton
gentleman, at the head of &s;ome militia, fell upon them, put them to rout, and
drove them to their &s;hips with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. But a &s;mall
&s;quadron of ten Engli&s;h &s;hips, had an opportunity of amply revenging this
di&s;grace upon the French. The Mare&s;chal de Thermes, governor of Calais, had
made an irruption into Flanders, with an army of fourteen thou&s;and men; and
having forced a pa&s;&s;age over the river Aa, had taken Dunkirk, and Berg St.
Winoc, and had advanced as far as Newport. But count Egmont coming &s;ud|denly
upon him, with &s;uperior forces, he was obliged to retire; and being
over|taken by the Spaniards near Gravelines, he cho&s;e very &s;kilfully his
ground for the engagement. He fortified his left wing with all the precautions
po&s;&s;ible; and po&s;ted his right along the river Aa, which, he rea&s;onably
thought, gave him a full &s;ecurity from that quarter. But the Engli&s;h
&s;hips, which were accidentally on the coa&s;t, being drawn by the noi&s;e of
the firing, &s;ailed up the river, and flanking the French, 
<PB N="400" REF="404"> did &s;uch execution by their artillery, that they put
them to flight; and the Spaniards gained a compleat victory<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Holing&s;hed&punc; p. 1150.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE the principal army of France, under the duke of
Gui&s;e, and that of Spain, under the duke of Savoy, approached very near each
other on the frontiers of Picardy; and as the two Kings had come into their
re&s;pective camps, attended by the flower of their nobility, men expected that
&s;ome great and important event would follow, from the emulation of the&s;e
warlike nations. But Philip, tho' actuated by the ambition, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
not the enterprize, of a con|queror; and he was willing, notwith&s;tanding the
&s;uperiority of his numbers, and the two great victories which he had gained
at St. Quintin and Gravelines, to put a period to the war by a treaty.
Negociations were entered into for that purpo&s;e; and as the terms offered by
the two monarchs were &s;omewhat wide of each other, the armies were put into
winter quarters, till the princes could come to better agreement. Among other
conditions, Henry demanded the re&s;titution of Navarre to its lawful owner;
Philip that of Calais and its territory to England: But in the mid&s;t of
the&s;e negociations and debates, news arrived of the death of Queen Mary; and
Philip, no longer connected with England, began to relax in his in&s;tances on
that capital article. This was the only circum&s;tance which could have made
the death of that prince&s;s a lo&s;s to the kingdom.</P>
<P>MARY had been long in a very declining &s;tate of health; and
having mi&s;taken her drop&s;y for a pregnancy, &s;he had made u&s;e of an
improper regimen, and her malady daily augmented. Every reflection now
tormented her: The con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of being hated by her &s;ubjects, the
pro&s;pect of Elizabeth's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, apprehen&s;ions of the danger to
which the catholic religion &s;tood expo&s;ed, dejection for the lo&s;s of
Calais<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The lo&s;s of Calais &s;o much affected
her, that &s;he &s;aid to her attendant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, that when &s;he was dead, they would find Calais at her
heart.</NOTE>, concern for the ill &s;tate of her affairs, and, above all,
anxiety for the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band, who, &s;he knew, intended &s;oon to
depart for Spain, and to &s;ettle there during the re&s;t of his life: All
the&s;e melancholy circum&s;tances preyed upon her mind, and threw her into a
lingering fever, of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the Queen.</NOTE>which &s;he
died, after a &s;hort and unfortunate reign of five years, four months,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17 November.</NOTE>and eleven days.</P>
<P>IT is not nece&s;&s;ary to employ many words in drawing the
character of this prin|ce&s;s. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed few qualities, either
e&s;timable or amiable; and her per&s;on was as little engaging as her
behaviour and addre&s;s. Ob&s;tinacy, bigotry, vio|lence, cruelty, malignity,
revenge, tyranny; every circum&s;tance of her cha|racter took a tincture from
her bad temper and narrow under&s;tanding. And <PB N="401" REF="405"> amid&s;t
that complication of vices, which entered into her compo&s;ition, we &s;hall
&s;carce find any virtue but &s;incerity; a quality, which &s;he &s;eems to
have main|tained throughout her whole life; except in the beginning of her
reign, when the nece&s;&s;ity of her affairs obliged her to make &s;ome
promi&s;es to the prote&s;tants, which &s;he certainly never intended to
perform. But in the&s;e ca&s;es a weak bi|gotted woman, under the government of
prie&s;ts, ea&s;ily finds ca&s;ui&s;try &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify to her&s;elf
the violation of an engagement. She appears al&s;o, as well as her father, to
have been &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;ome attachments of friend&s;hip; and that
without the caprice and incon&s;tancy which were &s;o remarkable in the conduct
of that monarch. To which we may add, that, in many circum&s;tances of her
life, &s;he gave indications of re&s;olution and vigour of mind; a quality,
which &s;eems to have been inherent in her family.</P>
<P>CARDINAL Pole had been long in a declining &s;tate of health
from an intermit|ing fever; and he died the &s;ame day with the Queen, about
&s;ixteen hours after her. The benign character of this prelate, the mode&s;ty
and humanity of his deport|ment, made him be univer&s;ally beloved; in&s;omuch
that in a nation, where the mo&s;t furious per&s;ecution was carried on, and
the mo&s;t violent religious factions pre|vailed, entire ju&s;tice, even by
mo&s;t of the reformers, has been done to his merit. The haughty pontiff, Paul
the fourth, had entertained &s;ome prejudices again&s;t him; and when England
declared war again&s;t Henry, the ally of that pope, he &s;eized the
opportunity of revenge, and revoking Pole's legantine commi&s;&s;ion, appointed
in his room cardinal Peyto, an ob&s;ervantine friar and confe&s;&s;or to the
Queen. But Mary would never permit the new legate to exerci&s;e his power; and
Paul was afterwards obliged to re&s;tore cardinal Pole to his authority.</P>
<P>THERE occur few general remarks, be&s;ides what have been taken
notice of in the cour&s;e of our narration, with regard to the general &s;tate
of the kingdom during this reign. The naval power of England was then &s;o
incon&s;iderable, that fourteen thou&s;and pounds being ordered to be applied
to the fleet by the trea&s;urer and admiral, both for repairing and victualling
it, they computed, that, when that money was expended, ten thou&s;and pounds a
year would afterwards an&s;wer a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">
nece&s;&s;ary charges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. III. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">9.</NOTE>. The arbitrary
proceedings of the Queen, abovementioned, j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">in|ed to many monopolies granted by this prince&s;s, as well as by
her father, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> very much the
growth of trade; and &s;o much the more, that all other princes in Europe
either were not permitted or did not find it nece&s;&s;ary to act in &s;o
tyran|ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">al a manner. Acts of
Parliament, both in the la&s;t reign and in the beginning of the pre&s;ent, had
laid the &s;ame impo&s;itions on the merchants of the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ll yard as on other aliens: Yet the Queen, immediately
after her marriage, comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ied with
the <PB N="402" REF="406"> &s;ollicitations of the emperor, and, by her
prerogative, &s;u&s;pended the&s;e acts of Parliament<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. XV. p. 364.</NOTE>. No body in that age pretended to
que&s;tion this exerci&s;e of the prerogative. The hi&s;torians are entirely
&s;ilent with regard to it; and it is only by the collection of public papers
that it is handed down to us.</P>
<P>AN ab&s;urd law had been made in the preceding reign, by which
every one was prohibited from making cloth unle&s;s he had &s;erved an
apprentice&s;hip for &s;even years. This law was repealed in the fir&s;t year
of the Queen's reign; and this plain rea&s;on given, that it had occa&s;ioned
the decay of the woolen manufac|tory, and had ruined &s;everal towns<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Mar. Parl. 2. cap. 7.</NOTE>. It is &s;trange that
Edward's law &s;hould have been revived during the reign of Elizabeth; and
&s;till more &s;trange, that it &s;hould &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>A PASSAGE to Archangel, by the north of Nova Zembla, had been
di&s;covered by the Engli&s;h during the la&s;t reign; and a beneficial trade
with Mu&s;covy had been e&s;tabli&s;hed. A &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y was &s;ent by
the Czar to Queen Mary. The amba&s;&s;adors were &s;hipwrecked on the coa&s;t
of Scotland; but being ho&s;pitably en|tertained there, they proceeded on their
journey, and were received at London with great pomp and &s;olemnity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 732. Heylin, p. 71.</NOTE>. This &s;eems to have
been the fir&s;t intercour&s;e, which that empire had with any of the we&s;tern
potentates of Europe.</P>
<P>A LAW was pa&s;&s;ed in this reign<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">4 &amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar. cap. 2.</NOTE>, by which the number of
hor&s;es, arms, and furniture, was e&s;tabli&s;hed, which each per&s;on,
according to the extent of his property, &s;hould be provided of for the
defence of the kingdom. A man of a thou&s;and pounds a year, for in&s;tance,
was obliged to maintain at his own charges &s;ix hor&s;es fit for demi-lances,
of which three at lea&s;t to be furni&s;hed with &s;uf|ficient harne&s;&s;es,
&s;teel &s;addles, and weapons proper for the demi-lances; and ten light
hor&s;es fit for light hor&s;emen, with furniture and weapons requi&s;ite for
them: He was al&s;o obliged to have forty cor&s;lets furni&s;hed; fifty almain
rivets, or in&s;tead of them, forty coats of plate, cor&s;lets or brigandines
furni&s;hed; forty pikes, thirty long bows, thirty &s;heafs of arrows, thirty
&s;teel caps or &s;kulls, twenty black bills or halberts, twenty haquebuts, and
twenty morions or &s;allets. We may remark, that a man of a thou&s;and merks of
&s;tock was rated equal to one of two hundred pounds a year: A proof that few
or none at that time lived on their &s;tock in money, and that great profits
were made by the merchants in the cour&s;e of their trade. There is no cla&s;s
above a thou&s;and pounds a year.</P>
