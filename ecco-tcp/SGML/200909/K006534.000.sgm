<HEAD>A <HI>LETTER,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE liberty which I take of addre&s;&s;ing you on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, very naturally ari&s;es from that indulgence which you have always &s;hewn to me, and from the opportu|nity which, both as Pre&s;ident of the College of Phy&s;icians and as a private gentleman, you have con&s;tantly granted for freedom of communication. Ea&s;y acce&s;s very often in|vites intru&s;ion; and, therefore, if your doors have been open and I have not denied my|&s;elf the &s;atisfaction of walking in, you mu&s;t lay to that account the vi&s;its which I have &s;ometimes made you, and blame your&s;elf alone for the interruption. I know not, however, whether at this time I ought to
<PB N="4" REF="3">pre&s;ume to con&s;ider my&s;elf as a welcome vi&s;itor, &s;ince the &s;ubject which I &s;hall pro|po&s;e for your examination (and on which I &s;hall ultimately hope for your approbation) will be an attack upon old opinions&mdash;in which, perhaps, I &s;hall find you fortified by numbers again&s;t me; but which I conceive to have been defended by a &s;uppo&s;ed imprac|ticability of the approach, rather than by the real &s;trength of the fortre&s;s.</P>
<P>The opinions to which I allude, are &s;uch which the world in general, medical as well as other men, have hitherto held concerning tho&s;e two very frequent di&s;ea&s;es, rheumati&s;m and gout; and which floating, as it were, in the minds of mankind, without any compa&s;s to direct, or rudder to &s;teer their cour&s;e, have been to&s;&s;ed about by prejudices, and at la&s;t lo&s;t in uncertainty. It is no argument to &s;ay, that in one of them &s;ometimes, and in the other often, we &s;ail on pro&s;perou&s;ly and reach the expected coa&s;t, &s;ince this is more the effect of chance than of any well concerted plan, and is owing rather to the nature of the ve&s;&s;el it&s;elf, than to the regular management of the pilot&mdash;which being well
<PB N="5" REF="4">built is blown over &s;hoals by &s;trong popular gales, and is driven, not conducted into har|bour.</P>
<P>Our ideas on the di&s;ea&s;es of rheumati&s;m and gout, have long, indeed, been very vague and very indeterminate; for although each practitioner might be guided in the treatment of them by a particular theory of his own, yet I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that every one of us has ob&s;erved phenomena, both in one and in the other, which he was unable to reconcile either to any preconceived opi|nion of the di&s;ea&s;e, or rationally and &s;atis|factorily to deduce from the laws of the ani|mal machine. For my&s;elf I will candidly confe&s;s that I have always con&s;idered rheu|mati&s;m as a di&s;ea&s;e as little under&s;tood, and as great a reproach to the faculty of phy&s;ic, as the gout&mdash;having been equally at a lo&s;s to ac|count for facts as they occurred in both: for although I have now pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal years of medical life, and have had the honour (I will al&s;o &s;ay the plea&s;ure) of &s;pending &s;ome of them in the large&s;t ho&s;pital of this me|tropolis, as one of its phy&s;icians, where there is annually admitted a number exceeding 10,000 patients; and although I have been,
<PB N="6" REF="5">and (I mention it with pride) am &s;till con|nected with gentlemen of the fir&s;t rank in their profe&s;&s;ion; yet the&s;e opportunities have merely been &s;ufficient to convince me that all the notions concerning the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, are almo&s;t as un&s;ettled and precarious, as the &s;ymptoms of them are anomalous and irre|gular.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat &s;ingular amid&s;t the contra|riety of opinions which have been held con|cerning the&s;e two di&s;ea&s;es, that all practi|tioners &s;hould hitherto have agreed in one point, that both of them are inflammations: but notwith&s;tanding the ma&s;s of a&s;&s;ertion which we may find indu&s;triou&s;ly collected in the earlie&s;t, as well as in later writers, I feel my&s;elf not only altogether unwilling to allow it, but mu&s;t contend decidedly and unequi|vocally again&s;t it. We know the &s;everal ways in which inflammatory action termi|nates, and when uninterrupted by art, we generally find that it ends in &s;uppuration or in gangrene, for the &s;low kind of inflamma|tion which now and then ends in &s;chirrus, may here be left out of the account; but I believe none of us ever &s;aw the rheumati&s;m
<PB N="7" REF="6">or the gout terminate either in the &s;uppurative or the gangrenous proce&s;s. It may, however, be told me that the termination of every rheu|matic and gouty ca&s;e may be by re&s;olution, the other only remaining way in which in|flammation is known to cea&s;e; and, there|fore, that every argument in &s;upport of a contrary doctrine mu&s;t become unnece&s;&s;ary: but (to &s;ay nothing of the improbability of every ca&s;e, though una&s;&s;i&s;ted and left to it&s;elf, nece&s;&s;arily and uniformly ending by re&s;olu|tion, when the very great majority of real inflammations, treated by every means which &s;kill can dictate, are known to terminate otherwi&s;e) if meeting the que&s;tion fairly I &s;hall &s;hew what may be the &s;eat and natural progre&s;s of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;ucceeding as I hope I &s;hall be found to do in tho&s;e parti|culars, I tru&s;t I &s;hall then be thought to have e&s;tabli&s;hed a more direct theory, however in|dependent it may prove to be on the doctrine of inflammations.</P>
<P>Although in the &s;equel of this letter I &s;hall produce arguments for a clo&s;e analogy be|tween the two di&s;ea&s;es, yet I will, to avoid confu&s;ion, con&s;ider them di&s;tinctly from each
<PB N="8" REF="7">other, as what I &s;hall advance concerning rheumati&s;m will then more ea&s;ily apply, and perhaps be better under&s;tood in the explana|tion of gout which will afterwards follow.</P>
<P>I need not bring to your recollection that the &s;y&s;tem of arterial ve&s;&s;els has a two-fold termination, and that it very gradually dimi|ni&s;hes by branching fir&s;t from the trunk, and by ramifying again from the branches, until it ends, either in mo&s;t minute capillary tubes which convey the blood into continuous veins, or in &s;ecerning extremities, which pre|pare and depo&s;it the matter of which the body is compo&s;ed, and which like &s;piracles give vent as it were to a portion of fluid &s;e|parated from the common ma&s;s, which, as a kind of irriguous exhalation, bedews and &s;oftens every inter&s;tice of the animal ma|chine. The&s;e from their office have properly enough attained the name of exhalants, and would very &s;oon di&s;tribute throughout the whole cellular texture, as well as every other cavity of the body &s;uch a quantity of moi&s;|ture as, when collected, would nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion drop&s;y, were not this extrava&s;ation almo&s;t immediately corrected by another &s;et
<PB N="9" REF="8">of ve&s;&s;els which have been denominated ab|&s;orbents or inhalants, and which at their ori|gin are of inconceivable exility: for if, as Arbuthnot has &s;tated, ten capillary arteries are not equal in &s;ize to the fine&s;t hair, and the lea&s;t lymphatic ve&s;&s;el be more than an hundred times le&s;s than the &s;malle&s;t capillary artery, the inhalant or ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t, at its commencement, be minute almo&s;t be|yond computation. But we need not at all go to the extent of &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;ince it will be &s;ufficient for our purpo&s;e to con&s;ider the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, as beginning by innumera|ble orifices leading directly to tubes, which in their capacities, are collectively equal at lea&s;t to the exhaling extremities of the arteries, and which may be con&s;idered together as forming a &s;eries of ve&s;&s;els, which in their turn are al&s;o collected into another &s;eries, and &s;o on until we are able to trace them into a di&s;tinct and regular arrangement, convey|ing fluid back again into the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem: It is in the&s;e exqui&s;itely fine and &s;lender radicles of the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els that I place the &s;eat of rheumati&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">I think we may be allowed to a&s;&s;ume it as an incontrovertible fact, that any ob&s;tacle to the free pa&s;&s;age of a fluid through a ca|nal, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity occa&s;ion an accumula|tion in the &s;everal &s;treams from which the canal is &s;upplied; and that the&s;e al&s;o, having their current interrupted, mu&s;t thereby as ne|ce&s;&s;arily impede the cour&s;e of the numberle&s;s rivulets which &s;hould otherwi&s;e ordinarily flow into them. And this we find univer&s;ally to be the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the lymphatic &s;y&s;|tem: for whatever may be the ob&s;tructing cau&s;e, every ve&s;&s;el immediately leading to the part ob&s;tructed mu&s;t be filled, and con&s;e|quently the ve&s;&s;els forming the next &s;eries mu&s;t be al&s;o di&s;tended; a &s;welling and tur|ge&s;cence mu&s;t therefore always ari&s;e in ex|tent proportionate to the &s;ize and number of collateral and ana&s;tomo&s;ing branches which may for a certain &s;pace divert the fluid, and then circuitou&s;ly convey it into the regular trunk again.</P>
<P>Every body knows what u&s;ually happens when a gland in the axilla has been &s;o great|ly enlarged (no matter from what cau&s;e) as
<PB N="11" REF="10">to prevent the fluid not only from pa&s;&s;ing through it, but al&s;o by pre&s;&s;ing upon the neighbouring lymphatics from pa&s;&s;ing through them al&s;o; that the arm &s;wells, and for a time remains in almo&s;t intolerable pain until the &s;wollen gland &s;ub&s;ides, or until the fluid finds a pa&s;&s;age by other more indirect cour&s;es. If it be objected that the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem is here al&s;o ob&s;tructed from the &s;ame cau&s;e, and that thence alone may ari&s;e the painful di&s;ten&s;ion of the limb, I would an&s;wer, that where lymphatic glands have been cut out by the knife, as mu&s;t be the ca&s;e when in the removal of a cancerous brea&s;t they have been found to be di&s;ea&s;ed from the ab&s;orbed &s;anies, that then where there is no tumor, but a con&s;iderable vacuity from an actual lo&s;s of &s;ub&s;tance, an interruption takes place from the de&s;truction of the u&s;ual pa&s;&s;ages, tumefaction is produced, and pain equally excruciating follows. When a di&s;ea&s;ed gland is extirpated from the groin, as now and then has been practi&s;ed in &s;ome &s;yphilitic ca&s;es, the leg and thigh will long afterwards continue in a painfully tume&s;ied &s;tate, until
<PB N="12" REF="11">the collateral canals &s;hall be capable of con|veying forwards the accumulated fluid. We have all of us &s;een, after &s;ome difficult ca&s;es of parturition, that one or both of the lower extremities have become oedema|tous and exce&s;&s;ively painful during a very con&s;iderable length of time, until the lym|phatic ve&s;&s;els of the pelvis, which have &s;uf|fered by the difficulty of the labour, &s;hall have recovered from the injury then &s;u&s;tained, or until others in their vicinity &s;hall, by gradual enlargement, be fully competent to di&s;charge their office for them. I know how|ever that there are in&s;tances where the pain is not &s;o great as I have generally &s;tated it to be in the examples which I have here ad|duced of ob&s;tructed lymphatics; but I be|lieve tho&s;e will only be found to happen in very debilitated &s;y&s;tems, where there mu&s;t con&s;equently al&s;o be a very dimini&s;hed energy in the action of the ab&s;orbents.</P>
<P>The ca&s;es which I have ju&s;t enumerated will be &s;ufficient to &s;hew not only the ge|neral effect produced by any ob&s;truction in the cour&s;e of a lymphatic ve&s;&s;el, but will very
<PB N="13" REF="12">much tend to elucidate the doctrine which I am now about to deliver concerning rheu|mati&s;m. I have already &s;aid that I con&s;ider the &s;eat of this di&s;ea&s;e as e&s;tabli&s;hed in the minuter &s;eries of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, which after|wards may more vi&s;ibly be demon&s;trated to be lymphatics. I &s;uppo&s;e that the common cau&s;es producing rheumati&s;m, &s;uch as the &s;udden application of &s;evere cold to the body when greatly heated, and more e&s;pe|cially of cold and moi&s;ture at the &s;ame time, affect all the different &s;eries of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, by occa&s;ioning a preternatural con|&s;triction of the ve&s;&s;els, and con&s;equently di|mini&s;hing their diameters. I need but men|tion the ready communicability of heat in bodies of unequal temperatures (as it is a law &s;o univer&s;ally under&s;tood), to &s;hew that a part po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a given degree of warmth, may &s;uddenly be deprived of it, and con|tracted in its dimen&s;ions (according to an|other general law), by expo&s;ing it to a me|dium inten&s;ely cold: for as the lymphatics about the joints u&s;ually run more &s;uperfi|cially than in other parts, and as there we generally find fewer collateral branches, ob|&s;truction
<PB N="14" REF="13">&s;truction may perhaps really happen more frequently from cold in tho&s;e parts than in others; but &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e, yet from the paucity of ve&s;&s;els, and the con&s;equent difficulty in the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of their fluid, when tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els have been con&s;tricted, ob&s;truction mu&s;t from any common cau&s;e be oftener there produced, accumulation mu&s;t take place, and tumor, heat, redne&s;s, and pain mu&s;t follow. When any &s;et of ve&s;|&s;els have thus had their natural arrangement altered, and their u&s;ual offices interrupted, the di&s;ten&s;ion may have been &s;o great as not only to have weakened them for the pre&s;ent, but to have deprived them of the power of di&s;charging their duty afterwards. In &s;ome in&s;tances indeed even actual rupture of a lymphatic, as I have occa&s;ionally &s;een in rheumati&s;m, may be the con&s;equence of di&s;|ten&s;ion; for as the fluid which is ab&s;orbed cannot po&s;&s;ibly regurgitate (notwith&s;tanding the doctrine of retrograde ab&s;orbents in a late popular work), becau&s;e ab&s;olutely pre|vented by the intervention of valves, and as the extremities of the ab&s;orbing ve&s;&s;els are here in a con&s;tant &s;tate of activity &s;till taking
<PB N="15" REF="14">up fre&s;h matter, the lymphatic mu&s;t either bur&s;t and di&s;charge it&s;elf into the neighbour|ing cellular membrane, or the ana&s;tomo&s;ing and collateral ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t adapt their capaci|ties to the reception and tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the increa&s;ed quantity of fluid. In either ca&s;e, however, whether of rupture, or of &s;uch preternatural di&s;ten&s;ion, we may ea&s;ily ob|&s;erve, that if the part it&s;elf be not de&s;troyed, yet the economy of it mu&s;t be extremely di&s;turbed, and in con&s;equence of &s;uch di&s;|turbance, that there will always be a liability to &s;imilar attacks in future, although the cau&s;e &s;hould even be le&s;s forcibly applied. I would even venture to &s;ay, that whenever either of tho&s;e ca&s;es (rupture or di&s;ten&s;ion) has happened, that almo&s;t any increa&s;ed ac|tion of the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem, whether ac|companied by expo&s;ure of the body to cold or not, may produce rheumati&s;m more or le&s;s violent, according to the continuance of that action, and according to the previous injury which may have been done to the lymphatic. Here then we &s;ee the preci&s;e difference between acute and chronic rheu|mati&s;m: The fir&s;t always depending upon
<PB N="16" REF="15">the operation of external and evident cau&s;es, which, when powerfully applied, produce a proportionate con&s;triction of the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, and con&s;equently an accumulation of fluid in them; the other ari&s;ing from cau&s;es le&s;s evident indeed, yet not le&s;s certain, but connected already with circum&s;tances which now always nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;ting mu&s;t con&s;ti|tute a predi&s;po&s;ition in the &s;y&s;tem to be af|fected by &s;uch cau&s;es, and &s;ubject it at all times to the effect of their immediate action.</P>
<P>I hope I may pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that the &s;udden alteration both of the &s;tate and &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e, as well as its tendency to frequent and unexpected recurrence, cannot militate again&s;t the doctrine which I have ju&s;t ad|vanced. The very incon&s;i&s;tent idea of me|ta&s;ta&s;is, or tran&s;ition of humor from one place to another, where there is no actual communication of ve&s;&s;els, ought not certainly to be adduced in argument to the contrary, unle&s;s it can be proved by &s;omething more than a&s;&s;ertion: for whoever can &s;uppo&s;e a lymphatic capable of being &s;uddenly con|&s;tricted, may rea&s;onably al&s;o imagine that con&s;triction may &s;ometimes be as &s;uddenly
<PB N="17" REF="16">removed, and that the ten&s;ion of the joint may therefore &s;ub&s;ide; and if an enlarge|ment even of the oppo&s;ite limb &s;hould then take place, with all the u&s;ual concomitants of heat, and pain, and redne&s;s, I &s;hould think it much more likely to have happened from the general di&s;po&s;ition to contractibility, which then particularly exi&s;ts in the lym|phatic &s;y&s;tem, and which may po&s;&s;ibly have been aided by the concurrent though un|heeded circum&s;tance of an unguarded expo|&s;ure to cold, than that the fluid &s;hould &s;o &s;uddenly have pa&s;&s;ed to a di&s;tant part of the body through ve&s;&s;els hitherto unob&s;erved; and &s;urely there can be nothing very ab|&s;urd in the &s;uppo&s;ition of an increa&s;ed con|tractibility, if we allow that the fever, as it is u&s;ually called, which attends rheumatic ca&s;es, can be &s;o propagated as to affect the &s;y&s;tem generally; &s;ince that very affection in the then very irritable &s;tate of the body, may carry along with it, even into the re|mote&s;t lymphatic ve&s;&s;el, a greater contractile tendency: for every body knows that there are circum&s;tances in which there is almo&s;t an exclu&s;ive affection of &s;ome parts of the ani|mal
<PB N="18" REF="17">machine, without much di&s;turbing the re&s;t; that opium, for example, &s;hall more e&s;pe|cially affect the nerves, mercury the ab&s;or|bents, and antimony the exhalants, that fat &s;hall be generally depo&s;ited in the cellular membrane, o&s;&s;eous matter in arteries, ve|nereal virus in bones, impetiginous acrimony on the &s;kin: there is nothing therefore very wonderful that under certain circum&s;tances al&s;o the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem &s;hould be more liable to be affected than at other times; and if we can believe it ever to be brought into that &s;ort of inactive or languid &s;tate, which we generally denominate relaxed, we &s;hall find no difficulty in allowing that it may &s;ometimes be influenced by an unu&s;ual de|gree of energy, and thence deviate into that morbid exce&s;s of it, which I have called, I know not whether properly or not, its con|tractibility.</P>
<P>From this general view which I have taken of the lymphatics, the frequent re|currence of the di&s;ea&s;e may ea&s;ily be ex|plained; and if we al&s;o recollect what I have &s;aid above re&s;pecting their rupture and di&s;ten|&s;ion, the probability of that explanation will be placed beyond all po&s;&s;ible doubt, whether
<PB N="19" REF="18">it be applied to the acute or to the chronic rheumati&s;m.</P>
<P>It will be told me perhaps that as tumor, heat, pain and redne&s;s, rigor, thir&s;t, occa|&s;ional vomiting, quickened circulation, and other &s;ymptoms of inflammatory action are pre&s;ent, that the rheumati&s;m is an inflamma|tion of a peculiar kind, having its own di&s;|tinct and particular termination; but &s;trong as the&s;e &s;igns certainly are, and characteri&s;tic as they may be thought to be of the pre|&s;ence of actual inflammation, yet who can|not, almo&s;t immediately, produce the whole of them by the application of a tight band|age? The limb &s;hall &s;well, feel hot, look red, throb, and be exceedingly painful; and yet although the pul&s;e &s;hall beat more fre|quently, &s;hivering come on, &s;ickne&s;s &s;ome|times &s;upervene, and the tongue and fauces even become dry, the&s;e &s;ymptoms of inflam|mation &s;hall immediately cea&s;e by the mere removal of the bandage. But here, by the way, it may be &s;aid, that &s;omething more than ob|&s;tructed lymphatics are concerned, and that the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem is ob&s;tructed al&s;o: but if where a general ob&s;truction has taken
<PB N="20" REF="19">place, as to produce at once &s;uch a powerful combination of &s;ymptoms &s;o &s;trongly indica|tory of inflammation, and yet without in|flammation actually ari&s;ing, the argument taken &s;ingly, with re&s;pect to the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, will certainly go to prove that in|flammation is not very likely to be the con|&s;equence of an ob&s;truction there, &s;ince it is not at all produced when we make the ap|plication to both of them together. I might go on to &s;ay, that even the very &s;igns of in|flammation, which I have mentioned, are &s;ometimes very ambiguous; for the pa&s;&s;ing of a &s;tone from the kidney into the bladder, or of a biliary calculus into the duodenum, will be accompanied with mo&s;t of them: The &s;pa&s;modic colic from lead, and cholera, and &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;es which might be in|&s;tanced, are attended al&s;o by &s;everal, and yet none of us ever dream of any thing like actual inflammation: and with re&s;pect to the idea of the rheumati&s;m having its inflam|matory action terminated in a manner pe|culiar only to it&s;elf, the &s;ame might, with equal propriety, be &s;aid of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which I have ju&s;t enumerated, and where
<PB N="21" REF="20">we know for certain that inflammation never happens: Neither will the buffy and &s;izy &s;tate of the blood, I &s;uppo&s;e, be now in&s;i&s;ted upon as an infallible proof of inflammation, &s;ince we all know that in any of the di&s;ea&s;es to which I am alluding, and in others where the &s;y&s;tem is acting &s;trongly, the very &s;ame appearance will undoubtedly occur. But the truth exactly is, that the rheu|mati&s;m can only terminate, as I have before &s;tated, by the lymphatic recovering its u&s;ual office, or by neighbouring branches perform|ing its duty for it, or by its rupture and the con&s;equent effu&s;ion of fluid into the cellular membrane; terminations &s;ufficiently di&s;tinct (except that of re&s;olution, which I have above con&s;idered) from tho&s;e of inflammation.</P>
<P>It may be needle&s;s for me to enter into the hi&s;tory of the &s;ymptoms of this di&s;ea&s;e, as it is in general &s;o well de&s;cribed by others, and, as I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, known almo&s;t to all. There is no &s;ea&s;on of the year in which the rheumati&s;m does not very frequently occur; but tho&s;e in which the vici&s;&s;itudes of temperature are mo&s;t &s;udden produce it of|tener than others. Expo&s;ure to cold and
<PB N="22" REF="21">moi&s;ture after violent exerci&s;e, &s;itting in a &s;trong current of air when the body is heat|ed, going into a damp bed, wearing wet clothes, or any &s;uch &s;imilar cau&s;e, will ge|nerally produce it. Rigor, heat, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, thir&s;t, and all the common &s;ymptoms of fever u&s;ually precede a &s;en&s;e of &s;orene&s;s and &s;tiffne&s;s, which in a day or two are followed by pain and &s;welling all over, but more e&s;|pecially about the joints of the body. The&s;e &s;wellings, increa&s;ing in &s;ize, look red, and become &s;mooth and glo&s;&s;y; they now and then &s;uddenly &s;ub&s;ide, and &s;ometimes as &s;ud|denly appear again in the &s;ame or in other joints: they do not receive the impre&s;&s;ion of the finger like ana&s;arcous tumors, except to|wards the termination of the complaint when they will occa&s;ionally recede a little upon pre&s;&s;ure. The tongue is commonly white through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;|ea&s;e. The bowels are u&s;ually co&s;tive, and the urine is of a pali&s;h amber colour, with a floating &s;emipellucid cloud. The fever, after an uncertain duration, dimini&s;hes by degrees, the water becomes turbid, and depo&s;its a pink-coloured &s;ediment, the &s;kin feels cool
<PB N="23" REF="22">and moi&s;t, and the pain irregularly abates, al|though it does not often entirely cea&s;e; and the &s;welling dimini&s;hes in the order in which it aro&s;e, fir&s;t in the larger branches of the lym|phatics, then in the &s;maller, fir&s;t, for example, in the wri&s;t, then in the hand, and afterwards in the fingers; but di&s;tor&s;ion, with little knotty protuberances, containing a glary fluid, and &s;ometimes an indurated cretaceous-like mat|ter, too frequently continues. The patient remains weak, and recovers very &s;lowly from a &s;evere attack of this di&s;ea&s;e, and which, from its aptitude to recur both with and without fever, generally hara&s;&s;es him more or le&s;s through the re&s;t of his life.</P>
<P>The different appellations, which have been given to this di&s;ea&s;e, &s;eem only to be of con&s;e|quence, as pointing out to us the part af|fected; for under whatever name it may be known, the method which we employ for its cure, after we have exactly a&s;certained its nature, is commonly the &s;ame. There are &s;ome indeed who think that a particular re|medy is more proper in one variety of rheu|mati&s;m than in another, and will u&s;e that in lumbago, which they never think of in &s;cia|tica;
<PB N="24" REF="23">but if there is general fever throughout the &s;y&s;tem, and great pain, with tumor of a part, it is not material with re&s;pect to the curative intention, whether it may be &s;eated in the loins or the &s;houlders, in an arm or a leg, an upper or a lower extremity. The thing mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary therefore for us to deter|mine in the method of cure, is the &s;imple di&s;|tinction of the di&s;ea&s;e into acute and chronic rheumati&s;m; and when that is once exactly known, we &s;hould employ that mode which rea&s;on and experience tell us to be the be&s;t: and if the ca&s;e be rendered &s;ometimes ob&s;cure, by being as it were blended, and by partak|ing of the nature both of one and of the other, we mu&s;t be guided by &s;ymptoms, and regulate our conduct accordingly: for if merely the part affected was to determine the remedy, and nothing more than ju&s;t know|ing it to be rheumati&s;m was judged nece&s;&s;ary for its cure, I am afraid that lamene&s;s and deformity would but too frequently be the re&s;ult of &s;uch irregular and un&s;cientific prac|tice.</P>
<P>One would &s;uppo&s;e, from the preci&s;ion with which men &s;peak and write upon this
<PB N="25" REF="24">di&s;ea&s;e, that there was nothing &s;o ea&s;y as the di&s;tinction of it into the acute and chronic &s;tate; and that putting the patient to bed, and increa&s;ing the external heat by covering him with a great number of blankets, would at once determine it; but although in the ge|nerality of ca&s;es we can from circum&s;tances certainly declare which is of one kind, and which of the other, yet I can by no means either allow that the application of external heat is the be&s;t criterion by which we are to be directed, or that it always increa&s;es the pain in the acute, whil&s;t it dimini&s;hes it in chronic rheumati&s;m.</P>
<P>It nece&s;&s;arily falls to my lot, in the di&s;|charge of my public duty (for I would not be thought vain and o&s;tentatious by arguing from what I may ob&s;erve in private practice), to &s;ee annually a great number of patients afflicted with this di&s;ea&s;e; but I do not find their pains &s;o regularly increa&s;ed by external heat as common opinion would have us to &s;uppo&s;e: nay, I will even venture to affirm, that where heat can be applied without pre&s;|&s;ure, as in warm and vapour baths, and &s;weating rooms, the rever&s;e is the fact, and
<PB N="26" REF="25">that not only chronic rheumati&s;m (as is al|lowed by all) will be thereby relieved, but that the acute al&s;o will be con&s;iderably miti|gated. The idea of comfort which we at|tach to a warm bed, has become &s;o habitual to us, that when the accu&s;tomed re&s;t does not follow, it is no wonder in our di&s;ap|pointment that we &s;hould &s;ometimes con|found terms together, and deduce an effect from a cau&s;e incapable of producing it: for I think it much more rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that a patient who cannot bear the pre&s;&s;ure of the hand, as is almo&s;t always the ca&s;e in acute rheumati&s;m, &s;hould experience pain equally intolerable by pre&s;&s;ure upon him in bed, than that warmth which under other circum&s;tances undoubtedly relieves, &s;hould here act otherwi&s;e:&mdash;but if I &s;hould be told that external pre&s;&s;ure is &s;o guarded again&s;t in many ca&s;es that increa&s;ed pain cannot thence be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e, I would rather hazard the opinion, that from the patient being placed in a reclined and horizontal po&s;ition, the mu&s;cles mu&s;t be put into other &s;tates than they were in before, and that in this devia|tion from their ordinary po&s;ture, pre&s;&s;ure
<PB N="27" REF="26">more or le&s;s mu&s;t con&s;equently be produced upon the di&s;tended lymphatic, than to allow any thing to the agency of external heat: during this mu&s;cular alteration al&s;o, we are impre&s;&s;ed with the idea that rheumatic pain pur&s;ues the cour&s;e of the mu&s;cle, when, in reality, it is felt in the direction of the lym|phatics, and is no farther connected with mu&s;cle, than water is with mu&s;cle in drop&s;i|cal &s;wellings of the cellular membrane; which lies indeed contiguous to it, but does not oc|cupy it as the actual &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It has generally been the fate of tho&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es, which have not been well under&s;tood, to have been treated in very different and even very contradictory methods; and as nature often prevails over the mo&s;t irrational practice, each of the&s;e &s;everal methods has at one time or other &s;ucceeded: we need not therefore wonder that men &s;hould &s;ometimes err in referring that to art which is the effect of cau&s;es purely natural. I might in&s;tance di&s;ea&s;es, not a few, in which either fal&s;e ob|&s;ervation, or ob&s;tinacy of opinion, or wrong deduction, or indolence, or &s;uper&s;tition has introduced &s;uch confu&s;ion and incongruity,
<PB N="28" REF="27">that it is extremely difficult for a phy&s;ician, who puts too much faith in what he has read, to form a proper deci&s;ion from what he &s;ees; for he finds it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;hake off the authoritative opinions of others, although the evidence of his own &s;en&s;es would lead him to a fairer and more obvious conclu&s;ion: whoever but even &s;uperficially con&s;iders the treatment of rheumati&s;m, will ob&s;erve one &s;trong example of the truth of the general remark which I have ju&s;t now made; for he will find phlebotomy, and bli&s;ters, and purges, and fomentations, and bark, and opium, and mercury, and antimony, and guaiacum, and volatile alkali, and turpentine, and a variety of other remedies applied indi&s;criminately in any &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, and which too have all of them in their turns, at one time or other, appeared to be u&s;eful; but he will not, if he has not lo&s;t his rea&s;oning faculties, ea&s;ily believe that from &s;uch a di&s;cordant collection of remedies, it is a matter of indifference which he &s;hall chu&s;e to employ, notwith|&s;tanding he might be told by this or that author, that each and all of them would cer|tainly cure the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">What I &s;hall deliver concerning the cure of rheumati&s;m, will be taken as, I think, every curative indication ought to be, from comparing the circum&s;tances as they gene|rally &s;ucceed each other, with tho&s;e which in the natural &s;tate of the body are known to con&s;titute health; and without being influ|enced either by the plau&s;ibility of a theory, where facts &s;eem not to accord with it, or by the authority of great names, which &s;ome|times we know can &s;tamp a value upon in|con&s;i&s;tency, I will ju&s;t &s;tate the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, and follow it as well as I am able, with the appropriate means of relief.</P>
<P>When a patient fir&s;t complains of &s;tiffne&s;s and &s;orene&s;s, and the&s;e are accompanied by the common &s;ebrile &s;ymptoms, we know not exactly what di&s;ea&s;e is about to &s;ucceed: for it may turn out to be ague, or any other &s;pecies of fever &s;trictly &s;o called, it may po&s;&s;ibly be one of the exanthematous di&s;ea&s;es, or it may be any one of &s;everal other di&s;orders, ju&s;t as likely as it may be rheumati&s;m:&mdash;but we know &s;uch an at|tack to be a deviation from the natural &s;tate of the body; and, therefore, immediately employ tho&s;e means which a proper con&s;ide|ration
<PB N="30" REF="29">of the concurrent &s;ymptoms &s;eems to require.&mdash;The patient is, perhaps, accordingly advi&s;ed to go to bed, and to u&s;e tho&s;e remedies which are calculated to promote an evacua|tion from the bowels, and produce an increa&s;|ed per&s;piration&mdash;but the choice of the&s;e reme|dies is certainly not a matter of indifference; a di&s;ea&s;e of con&s;iderable activity, as we judge from the previous and then exi&s;ting circum|&s;tances, is now approaching, and, therefore, in our endeavour to regulate the di&s;ordered &s;tate of the animal economy, we &s;hould be careful le&s;t our attempt &s;hould be the cau&s;e of much greater confu&s;ion. In &s;uch ca&s;es I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e phy&s;icians would rather &s;im|ply employ the neutral &s;alts, than purge with calomel, or jalap, or colocynth, or any of the re&s;inous articles of the Materia Medica, notwith&s;tanding it might appear to the patient, and to his friends, as a thing of very little moment how the evacuation was procured, or whether a cooling or a &s;timulating medi|cine had produced it: and for the &s;ame rea|&s;on would bath the legs in warm water, and u&s;e antimony, and ipecacuanha, and &s;aline mixtures, and all the milder kinds of diluent
<PB N="31" REF="30">and diaphoretic remedies, in preference to guaiacum or contrayerva, or &s;pice, or alko|hol, or volatile alkali; for if by relaxing the excretories, per&s;piration can by the common and the natural power of the &s;y&s;tem be more copiou&s;ly produced, there is no need of quickening the circulation, and con&s;equently of &s;timulating any &s;et of ve&s;&s;els to produce the &s;ame effect, when an increa&s;ed action of the &s;y&s;tem is not only not de&s;irable but is even hurtful.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, for the &s;ake of ar|gument, that the di&s;ea&s;e does not in a day or two yield to this method of treat|ment, but (as is then always the ca&s;e) &s;hews it&s;elf by more evident &s;ymptoms actually to be rheumati&s;m: we may then, if we plea&s;e, certainly proceed with &s;trict propriety to phlebotomy as another powerful means of dimini&s;hing the activity of the &s;y&s;tem, we may urge our relaxant plant with greater energy, we may &s;upply our diluents plenti|fully, we may u&s;e fomentations, or the warm bath, we may apply leeches, and we may give opiates: by this time, perhaps, the di&s;|ea&s;e may have been mitigated, and as the &s;y&s;tem may probably have been much weak|ened,
<PB N="32" REF="31">by the nece&s;&s;ary evacuations, &s;omething more cordial as well as tonic may now be allowed along with the relaxant remedies; but we &s;hould be well convinced that the rheumati&s;m has very much &s;ub&s;ided before we hazard the u&s;e of wine, or &s;teel, or bark &s;ingly.&mdash;Irregular pains will now, perhaps, occupy different parts, although the febrile &s;ymptoms &s;hall have cea&s;ed altogether; and, therefore, in this latter &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e we may apply cupping gla&s;&s;es, and bli&s;ters, and &s;timulating pla&s;ters, and liniments; and we may u&s;e calomel, or volatile alkali, or turpentine, or guaiacum, or any other re|medy of that cla&s;s, which we may then more particularly approve.</P>
<P>This we may con&s;ider as the general out|line of the cure of rheumati&s;m, which it is &s;ufficiently ea&s;y for any of us to fill up ac|cording as the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e may vary, or as circum&s;tances may require.&mdash;I will further, however, endeavour to &s;hew as briefly as I can, how the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of remedies into which I have thought it right to divide the Materia Medica can be applied, and of which I &s;hall more e&s;pecially mention
<PB N="33" REF="32">tho&s;e medicines who&s;e u&s;e has commonly ob|tained in this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The cla&s;s of a&s;tringents &s;eems but of little u&s;e in the commencement of rheumati&s;m; for where there is too much ob&s;truction al|ready, one would not hazard any remedy which might po&s;&s;ibly dimini&s;h the area of ve&s;&s;els&mdash;and although it might be &s;aid that the ob&s;tructed ve&s;&s;els cannot admit of further con&s;triction, from the impo&s;&s;ibility of receiv|ing the a&s;tringent remedy into them, yet no one will doubt that it may find admi&s;&s;ion into the neighbouring ve&s;&s;els, and con&s;e|quently deny to the collateral branches that ready communication with the ob&s;tructed part, by which it u&s;ually experiences relief: and here I will ob&s;erve, once for all, that I con&s;ider every medicine as carried through the &s;y&s;tem, and as capable of acting upon the containing ve&s;&s;els; for although it may be a&s;ked, how can we conceive it probable that a grain or two of an a&s;tringent medicine can be &s;o divided as to affect every part of the body; I would an&s;wer, that perhaps on this very divi&s;ibility of it depends its greater efficacy, and that if by the common te&s;ts of
<PB N="34" REF="33">chemical experiments, we can certainly di&s;|cover a &s;ingle grain of vitriolated iron mi|nutely diffu&s;ed through every drop of &s;everal gallons of water, there is no good rea&s;on to reject the &s;uppo&s;ition that the &s;ame, or any other medicine, may be equally divided and diffu&s;ed through the whole animal machine. I am well aware of opinions to the contrary; but it is unnece&s;&s;ary to make any further di|gre&s;&s;ion upon a &s;ubject which is not immedi|ately before us. But although in the early &s;tages of rheumati&s;m, an a&s;tringent remedy cannot be employed with advantage, yet when the pain and &s;welling have &s;ub&s;ided, and the &s;trength of the patient has nece&s;&s;arily been greatly dimini&s;hed by the continuance, as well as by the treatment of the di&s;ea&s;e, it may then be given with con&s;iderable benefit. It does not belong to this place to &s;hew how a&s;tringents may &s;econdarily produce a tonic effect: otherwi&s;e I might &s;tate that a gentle a&s;trictive power con&s;tantly applied to the &s;imple fibre, mu&s;t increa&s;e the cohe&s;ion of its parts, and con&s;equently render it &s;tronger; and that whil&s;t this application is made (as I conceive it may be made univer&s;ally, whether
<PB N="35" REF="34">by acids, or by metallic or vegetable matters) a greater energy is given to the whole &s;y&s;tem, by which it is enabled to di&s;charge its &s;everal functions more and more perfectly, until at la&s;t the regular and natural tone of it is com|pletely re&s;tored.</P>
<P>Emollients from affecting the &s;imple fibre, in a manner directly the rever&s;e of a&s;trin|gents, I need not &s;ay ought to be u&s;ed when the ten&s;ion is great, and heat and pain con|&s;equently very urgent; for under contrary circum&s;tances every one thinks the mollify|ing power of oil, or mucilage, or water, either applied &s;eparately or in the form of liniments, poultices, or fomentations, not only unnece&s;&s;ary but &s;ometimes hurtful.</P>
<P>I have before taken occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that every thing which &s;timulates the &s;y&s;tem in &s;ome &s;tages of the acute rheumati&s;m mu&s;t be improper; the cla&s;s of &s;timulants therefore, which increa&s;es the action of the living &s;olid, can only be employed under particular cir|cum&s;tances of this di&s;ea&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the frequent and indi&s;criminate u&s;e which is made of &s;ome of the remedies which are therein contained. If anatomi&s;ts are right
<PB N="36" REF="35">in &s;aying that there is a &s;ecerning extremity of an artery, who&s;e &s;ecretion may be aug|mented in proportion as the circulation is increa&s;ed, and if I am right al&s;o in fixing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat of rheumati&s;m, as I have already done, in tho&s;e &s;maller ve&s;&s;els which con&s;titute the fir&s;t orders of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, &s;urely no remedy can be proper which tends to pro|mote the &s;ecretion of a larger quantity of a fluid, which is at pre&s;ent in too great abun|dance, and who&s;e ab&s;orption mu&s;t undoubt|edly add to the exi&s;ting difficulties; for here I &s;uppo&s;e &s;trong ab&s;orptive efforts always to take place, &s;ince in rheumati&s;m the extremi|ties of the lymphatics are active and vigor|ous, and the body not otherwi&s;e in a &s;tate of di&s;ea&s;e, than as it may be induced by the ob&s;truction and di&s;tention in the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els&mdash;far different from that &s;tate where the energy of the animal machine has been de&s;troyed by previous di&s;ea&s;e, where the fluid is permitted as it were to e&s;cape from the ar|tery through its &s;ecerning extremity, where it is collected in every cavity, where it is dif|fu&s;ed every where throughout the cellular membrane, and where the ab&s;orbents are as it &s;hould almo&s;t &s;eem in a &s;tate of flaccidity,
<PB N="37" REF="36">and have not force &s;ufficient either to expand their orifices, or power to imbibe the extra|va&s;ated humidity.</P>
<P>As the&s;e ob&s;ervations will abundantly &s;uf|fice to elucidate the idea which I have enter|tained both of the abu&s;e of &s;timulants in rheumatic ca&s;es, and of the time al&s;o when they may occa&s;ionally be given with advan|tage, I will only ob&s;erve, that the nearer the &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e is to that which we com|monly call chronic, and of cour&s;e the le&s;s connected it may be with pain, and heat, and tumor, the more rationally will this cla&s;s of remedies be applied. Although the guaia|cum is chiefly u&s;ed, yet any of the re&s;ins, or the bal&s;ams, may properly enough be em|ployed with &s;imilar intentions&mdash;for when the &s;y&s;tem is languid, the circulation feeble, the pains irregular, and the lymphatic wea|kened by di&s;tention, we want &s;omething to promote a &s;teady uniform action&mdash;for as de|bility will equally operate in occa&s;ioning conge&s;tion in the lymphatics as in other places; &s;o any thing which increa&s;es the activity of the living &s;olid may remove it, and by producing an uniformity of action
<PB N="38" REF="37">afterwards prevent its recurrence. I know very well that my opinion re&s;pecting the u&s;e of &s;timulants in acute rheumati&s;m, will be attacked by the argument of volatile alkali (which we all allow to be one of the mo&s;t active medicines of this cla&s;s) being very fre|quently given with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s, and promoting an ea&s;y and a copious diaphore&s;is; but that I may not &s;hrink from the opinion, and de&s;ert it as ill-founded, I beg leave to urge in favour of it, that in nine ca&s;es out of ten, the &s;timulant power of ammonia is de&s;troyed, before it can po&s;&s;ibly act upon the &s;y&s;tem in general. Every one who knows any thing about chemical affinities will agree with me when I a&s;&s;ert, that the mucus of the &s;tomach will immediately unite with it into a kind of &s;aponaceous ma&s;s, and as &s;uch directly render its &s;timulant effect very doubtful; but if it be allowed that acrid, or acid matters ever exi&s;t in the &s;tomach, the ammonia which was given under the impre&s;|&s;ion of its &s;timulating power will be con|verted into a neutral &s;alt, into a kind of <HI>&s;piri|tus mindereri,</HI> and act upon the &s;y&s;tem with a truly <HI>relaxant power.</HI> I have no he&s;itation
<PB N="39" REF="38">in &s;aying, that &s;uch is my opinion al&s;o with re&s;pect to the two fixt alkalies, the kali and natron, which I con&s;ider as &s;timulants in le&s;s degree, but which are convertible into very different medicines, by the means above|mentioned: if likewife, as is u&s;ual, the pa|tient dilutes plentifully with &s;imple watery fluids, the fact will be more obvious, and the relaxation much more compleat. Al|though I &s;hall not, perhaps, be allowed by &s;ome to reckon calomel, and other mercu|rial preparations, as belonging to the cla&s;s of &s;timulants; yet experience will bear me out in &s;aying, that mercury is as hurtful in the acute, as it is u&s;eful in the chronic rheuma|ti&s;m: I do not mean to &s;ay, that an occa|&s;ional mercurial purge can do any particular mi&s;chief in the mo&s;t acute &s;tage of the di&s;|ea&s;e; but wi&s;h my ob&s;ervation, re&s;pecting this mineral, to be applied only to its regu|larly repeated do&s;e, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, given after certain intervals, like any other &s;timu|lant medicine, and which, I believe, in acute ca&s;es always aggravates the di&s;ea&s;e. All acrid matters taken from the vegetable king|dom as &s;timulants, mu&s;t not for the &s;ame
<PB N="40" REF="39">rea&s;ons be indi&s;criminately employed; for the arum, cochlearia, na&s;turtium, raphanus, and &s;uch like, cannot be proper, except in chronic ca&s;es: in the &s;ame kind of general ob&s;erva|tion I might include the aromata, which are &s;ometimes given, as well as tho&s;e other more &s;trictly medicinal articles contrayerva, &s;erpen|taria, and ca&s;carilla: there are others &s;uch as &s;ar&s;aparilla and &s;a&s;&s;afras, which might al&s;o be included in the above remark; but the effects, which I &s;hould otherwi&s;e expect from their &s;timulant power, are often obviated by the watery vehicle with which they are diluted, when given, as they u&s;ually are, in the form of decoctions: I need not add that vinous liquors of every kind mu&s;t, however they may be diluted, be con&s;idered as very highly improper in acute rheumati&s;m, whether ad|mini&s;tered under the denomination of &s;pirits, tinctures, wines or ales. The tepid &s;prings of Buxton, and of Bath, when taken inter|nally, &s;eem to me to produce that gently continued &s;timulant effect which I have con|ceived to be &s;o very e&s;&s;ential towards obtain|ing the cure of chronic rheumati&s;m.&mdash;I know very well that ca&s;es al&s;o of the acute kind
<PB N="41" REF="40">are relieved by both of tho&s;e waters (by tho&s;e of Buxton more e&s;pecially); but, I &s;up|po&s;e, in tho&s;e in&s;tances that the good effects produced, have ari&s;en rather from the emolli|ent and relaxant power of the external appli|cation, than from their internal exhibition; I will not, however, pretend to deny that as diluents al&s;o, they may &s;ometimes be &s;ervice|able in acute rheumati&s;m, and that, when u&s;ed as baths, they likewi&s;e very con&s;tantly relieve the chronic &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>If what I have &s;aid re&s;pecting &s;timulants be founded in rea&s;on, very little argument will be nece&s;&s;ary to prove, that the cla&s;s of &s;eda|tives mu&s;t, in almo&s;t every &s;tage of the di&s;|ea&s;e, be proper. I would beg, however, to be under&s;tood, that I call tho&s;e remedies &s;e|dative, which, without weakening the &s;y&s;tem, dimini&s;h its activity, and which may from a &s;tate of motion, bring it under certain cir|cum&s;tances entirely to re&s;t: all medicines, therefore, of the narcotic kind, will be in|cluded under that di&s;tinction which I intend by the cla&s;s of &s;edatives; for the great vari|ety of remedies, which are &s;aid to produce a &s;edative effect, produce it &s;econdarily only
<PB N="42" REF="41">through the intervention of &s;ome primarily acting cau&s;e: thus will a&s;afoetida, or ammo|niacum, or amber, or ca&s;tor, or mu&s;k, which we every day &s;ee given in &s;ome &s;pa&s;modic affections, overcome irregularity, or inequa|lity of action, by means of their &s;timulant power, indirectly producing, with re&s;pect to the exi&s;ting &s;ymptoms, a compleat &s;edative ef|fect. Opium and cicuta are the &s;edatives which I have more e&s;pecially employed in this di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;uch as may boldly be given every three or four hours, when the circum&s;tances of ten&s;ion and pain, and watchfulne&s;s, &s;eem to require them&mdash;Aconitum, hyo&s;cyamus, digi|talis, and &s;ome others may, perhaps, like|wi&s;e be found occa&s;ionally &s;erviceable; but cu&s;tom has not yet &s;ufficiently familiari&s;ed the&s;e even within the &s;phere of medical practice. I think from the effects ob&s;ervable after a large do&s;e of camphor, that I am au|thorized in con&s;idering it al&s;o as a powerful &s;edative&mdash;as &s;uch I have very frequently given it, and as &s;uch al&s;o, from the benefit generally obtained, I cannot but very &s;trongly recommend it.</P>
<P>Tonics which may be &s;aid to maintain the
<PB N="43" REF="42">power of the &s;y&s;tem, without increa&s;ing its action, may certainly very often be given with great advantage; but when the body is already &s;trong, when the circulation is power|ful, the mu&s;cles firm, and the &s;ecretions re|gular, they cannot, I believe, do any good whatever. For in acute rheumati&s;m, where the &s;y&s;tem in point of &s;trength deviates little or nothing from its natural &s;tate, we u&s;ually, among&s;t other modes of relief, attempt the recovery of our patient by means al&s;o which have a tendency to dimini&s;h both its force and its activity; and, therefore, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e when in the cour&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e the body becomes exhau&s;ted, the circulation weak, the mu&s;cular power enfeebled, and the functions imperfectly di&s;charged, that bark, and &s;teel, and bitters, and &s;uch like remedies, were then only admi&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The benefit which may be traced from the u&s;e of relaxants, in the acute &s;tage of this di&s;ea&s;e, will always attach a very con&s;idera|ble value to this cla&s;s of remedies. If we examine the opinions of tho&s;e who are the be&s;t informed upon this &s;ubject, we &s;hall at lea&s;t find the majority of them favouring and
<PB N="44" REF="43">recommending a relaxant plan; for bleeding, purging, and &s;weating are, as it were, the three great cardinal pivots on which both the ancient and modern practice &s;eems to turn. That the lo&s;s of blood will dimini&s;h the acutene&s;s of this di&s;ea&s;e, experience abun|dantly confirms; but if we keep in view the account which I have above given, of its nature, and of its &s;eat, we &s;hall then mo&s;t clearly &s;ee, that the dimini&s;hed quantity of circulating fluids mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion a diminution in the quantity to be &s;eparated by the &s;ecerning extremity of the artery, and con&s;equently afford proportionally le&s;s to the active and healthy operation of the orifices of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els: hence, if any part of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem be over|charged and di&s;tended, it hereby acquires time to accommodate it&s;elf to the ob&s;truct|ing cau&s;e; for as a depletion has been made in the blood ve&s;&s;els, it is neither equally pre&s;&s;ed upon from behind by the acce&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h fluid, nor meets an equal ob&s;tacle to the regular di&s;charge of its burthen into the veins, but then more readily propels its contents, and contracts it&s;elf to its u&s;ual dimen&s;ions.
<PB N="45" REF="44">The advantages to be derived from purging in acute rheumati&s;m do not merely depend upon the excrementitious matter evacuated, but upon the lo&s;s of a large quantity of fluid poured from the different excretories into the inte&s;tinal canal during the operation; for the &s;udden evacuation of any fluid, tends directly to dimini&s;h the quantity in the cir|culating ve&s;&s;els, and mu&s;t con&s;equently pro|duce a proportionate degree of general relaxa|tion. The remedies which will promote a determination, as it is called, to the &s;urface, have always been held to be proper both in the acute and in the chronic rheumati&s;m; but the choice of them is not, as I have before ob&s;erved, a matter of &s;mall moment; for there is a manife&s;t difference, whether the diaphore&s;is be produced by &s;timulant or by relaxant remedies. I need not again go over arguments to prove that the chronic rheuma|ti&s;m, which is more e&s;pecially confined to a part, owes its very exi&s;tence to the debility there produced by previous injury, either from di&s;ten&s;ion or from rupture&mdash;in either of the&s;e ca&s;es, a regularly exhibited &s;timulant, by giving a little more energy to the whole
<PB N="46" REF="45">&s;y&s;tem, promotes a more uniform action of the di&s;ea&s;ed part, and often completely effects a cure: but it is not nece&s;&s;ary, I think, that <HI>actual &s;weating</HI> &s;hould be produced; for the cure depends, as I &s;uppo&s;e, not upon ex|ce&s;s of action, but upon its uniformity: for the exce&s;s either with, but more particularly without &s;weating, often aggravates the di&s;|ea&s;e. In the acute rheumati&s;m, however, where the &s;y&s;tem is in general acting pow|fully, and where the part di&s;ea&s;ed has really become &s;o from cau&s;es of ob&s;truction, which are entirely independent of debility, the dia|phore&s;is mu&s;t be produced by very different means: and here the neutral mixture of acid and alkali would hold a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed place, were it given in large and proper do&s;es; but as the prejudices of mankind will not often allow them to get out of a beaten path, we are too frequently obliged either to exhibit this milde&s;t and very efficacious re|laxant in a manner &s;o inert as almo&s;t to di&s;|grace its character as a medicine, or to call in the aid of other remedies, which are ac|tive in &s;maller do&s;es: for if it is intended to produce the full effect of a relaxant, I think
<PB N="47" REF="46">it &s;hould be given as an ordinary drink, in the way in which we would direct barley|water, lemonade, imperial, or any other com|mon or medicated diluent. In this mode of admini&s;tration it would operate upon the bowels al&s;o as a gentle laxative, and render the u&s;e of kali vitriolatum, kali tartari&s;atum, natron vitriolatum, and others of this cla&s;s, which we u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;h by the general name of neutral &s;alts, almo&s;t altogether un|nece&s;&s;ary; &s;ome of which however, by the bye, and perhaps all of them, if given in &s;maller do&s;es, than tho&s;e in which they are commonly exhibited as purgatives, would be little if at all inferior to the celebrated draught of Riverius.</P>
<P>In the cla&s;s of relaxants, u&s;eful in acute rheumati&s;m, I mu&s;t very particularly reckon the antimonials. I need not &s;ay that all of them may be &s;o managed, as to produce their proper effect; and that even in the chronic &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, they may be &s;o combined with calomel, guaiacum, or other &s;timulants, as to form a remedy often very highly &s;erviceable. Ipecacuanha, and per|haps &s;ome other remedies which in certain
<PB N="48" REF="47">do&s;es provoke nau&s;es, belong al&s;o to this cla&s;s of relaxants: The pulvis ipecacuanhae com|po&s;itus (Dover's powder) has long been con|&s;idered as a medicine of very great utility in acute rheumati&s;m; and is one of tho&s;e hap|py compounds, where the relaxant effects derived from two of its ingredients, &s;eem to be improved by the &s;edative power of the opium.</P>
<P>Water, milk and water, milk-whey, but|ter-milk, barley-water, and &s;uch others as may alter the &s;tate of the fluids &s;imply by <HI>diluting</HI> them, are very proper, both in the acute and in the chronic rheumati&s;m; but indeed I do not know whether I ought to have &s;tated any thing as <HI>diluent</HI> be&s;ides water; for the others which I have enumerated, together with all the various mucilaginous decoctions, mixtures, and emul&s;ions, which might be mentioned, &s;eem more particularly to belong to the cla&s;s of <HI>demulcents,</HI> which in rheumati&s;m, as we do not &s;uppo&s;e any acri|mony pre&s;ent in the &s;y&s;tem, as its cau&s;e, we need not particularly con&s;ider.</P>
<P>The remaining cla&s;&s;es of remedies which merely promote the di&s;charge of matters from the body which have become oppre&s;&s;ive or
<PB N="49" REF="48">excrementitious, without affecting (or affect|ing but little) the general economy of the animal machine, are but in a &s;mall degree applicable in the cure of rheumati&s;m. Thus <HI>apophlegmatics</HI> or tho&s;e remedies which clean&s;e the mouth and fauces, are not at all nece&s;&s;arily employed in this di&s;ea&s;e. <HI>Emetics</HI> indeed may indirectly promote the action of the ab&s;orbents, and may or may not, as cir|cum&s;tances happen to combine, be u&s;eful in &s;ome ca&s;es; and if they are given only in &s;uch &s;mall do&s;es as to create a con&s;tant nau|&s;ea, they may certainly produce a relaxant effect. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation may al&s;o be extended to <HI>purgatives,</HI> which be&s;ides eva|cuating the inte&s;tinal canal may, as I have above ob&s;erved, be followed by other very beneficial effects: but until we &s;hall be con|vinced that there is &s;ome morbific matter to be expelled, which is the cau&s;e of rheuma|ti&s;m, or granting that, until we can bring our&s;elves to &s;uppo&s;e that by means of glan|dular &s;ecretion, &s;uch a matter can be &s;eparated from the general ma&s;s of fluids, and more|over that the kidnies are the glands more di|rectly appropriated to that purpo&s;e, we &s;hall
<PB N="50" REF="49">not, I think, completely tru&s;t the cure of this di&s;ea&s;e to the very fallacious and uncertain action of <HI>diuretics.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH, dear Sir, are the opinions which I have long entertained re&s;pecting rheumati&s;m: I have been led towards them by no blind guides; for in this, as well as in mo&s;t other things which bear any relation to our profe&s;|&s;ion, I have endeavoured to follow rea&s;on and experience. I may indeed have mi&s;|taken my conductors, and been impo&s;ed upon by the meretricious charms of fancy and hypothe&s;is; but unle&s;s you who are &s;o well qualified to be my judge, convict me of error, I mu&s;t &s;till continue to advance and to maintain them. Influenced therefore by the &s;ame &s;entiments, and guided, as I believe, by the &s;ame directors, I will now proceed to con&s;ider the principal phenomena attendant upon gout; and to point out, as con&s;i&s;tently as I am able, &s;ome of tho&s;e almo&s;t unintel|ligible circum&s;tances which have always ac|companied this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="50">As I have endavoured, in the former part of this letter, to make it appear that neither gout nor rheumati&s;m are at all con|nected with the doctrine of inflammation, it will be unnece&s;&s;ary for me here to repeat the arguments, which I then adduced in &s;upport of an opinion, which was intended to be di&s;tinct|ly and unequivocally under&s;tood. The ana|logy which thence I think exi&s;ts between the two di&s;ea&s;es will become however much more obvious when we &s;hall have con&s;idered that the &s;eat of both is preci&s;ely the &s;ame, that their progre&s;s is not much unlike, and their termination not very di&s;&s;imilar.</P>
<P>Flatulence, eructation, nau&s;ea, coldne&s;s in the region of the &s;tomach, dy&s;pep&s;ia, borbo|rygmi, languor, vertigo, palpitation, dy&s;|pnaea, quick &s;mall and interrupted pul&s;e, &s;light rigors, with irregular and clammy &s;weats, all or &s;ome of them u&s;ually accom|pany the gout; and if pain be con&s;tant and exce&s;&s;ive, either in the hands or feet, wri&s;ts, elbows, ancles or knees, attended with the common febrile &s;ymptoms, and increa&s;ing for &s;everal hours with heat, redne&s;s, and tumor, and, in the cour&s;e of a few days, gradually
<PB N="52" REF="51">again &s;ub&s;iding with itching and &s;weating of the part, the patient is &s;aid to have had a re|gular &s;it of the gout; but if the pain &s;hould be equally violent, and in&s;tead of the extre|mities &s;hould affect the head, or lungs, or &s;tomach, or bowels, or kidnies, or bladder, the gout is denominated <HI>mi&s;placed;</HI> but if the pain &s;hould be incon&s;tant, with re&s;pect to its duration, and attack one place, and then an|other, without producing any very con&s;ider|able heat or tumor, it generally obtains the name of an <HI>irregular</HI> fit. To the&s;e may, I think, be referred all the varieties of gout which we meet with either in books or in practice; and the&s;e again, as we &s;hall pre|&s;ently &s;ee, might, I believe, be more properly di&s;tingui&s;hed, like rheumati&s;m, into the acute and chronic.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ations which patients experience during a fit of the gout, are &s;o different|ly de&s;cribed by them, that we cannot col|lect any thing very accurately from their de&s;criptions, except one circum&s;tance, and in that they all agree, that the pain is exqui|&s;ite. In one it gnaws, in another it lacerates, in this it burns like red hot iron, in that it chills him like ice, this feels the bones &s;crewed
<PB N="53" REF="52">out of their &s;ockets, and that declares them to be brui&s;ed to a jelly. In &s;hort, in this as in other di&s;ea&s;es where there is exce&s;s of pain, the &s;en&s;es mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be di&s;turbed; and as &s;en&s;ation has thus con&s;equently been rendered imperfect, we may very naturally expect a diver&s;ity in their de&s;criptions.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved of gout, that it &s;el|dom attacks any per&s;ons but tho&s;e of adult age&mdash;and of the&s;e more particularly, perhaps only, &s;uch as have indulged in tho&s;e kinds of exce&s;&s;es, which have done violence to the &s;y&s;tem, by di&s;turbing or de&s;troying its func|tions. And here, in the very foremo&s;t rank, mu&s;t I place that mo&s;t pernicious of all po&s;&s;i|ble habits, which con&s;i&s;ts in the u&s;e of vinous and &s;pirituous liquors: for not only gout, but drop&s;y, pal&s;y, apoplexy, and in&s;anity, in a manner mo&s;t evident and incontrovertible, are too frequently derived from the abu&s;e of them. I need not endeavour to make the picture more horrible, by filling it up with groupes of mi&s;erable wretches, who deduce their di&s;ea&s;es from the &s;ame undoubted cau&s;e; otherwi&s;e I might &s;tate it as a fact, that at lea&s;t the half of all their infirmities is &s;o produced, and that there is not perhaps more
<PB N="54" REF="53">than one fourth of the catalogue unconnected with it. I might al&s;o extend my ob&s;ervation to the influence which this mo&s;t fatal cu&s;tom has upon the morals of the world, were I not likely to be con&s;idered as &s;traying a little beyond the line of my profe&s;&s;ion: I cannot however help mentioning, that in one of the ho&s;pitals, where I have the honour of having my &s;ervices accepted as the phy&s;ician, that not one in &s;ix of tho&s;e unhappy females, who have been addicted to intemperance in drinking, is reclaimed, although more than two thirds of the <HI>whole number</HI> there ad|mitted are eventually reformed. But let not the argument, again&s;t the abu&s;e of liquors, be &s;uppo&s;ed only to be applied to tho&s;e in the lowe&s;t ranks of &s;ociety, for it will be found ju&s;t and applicable to all; as well to tho&s;e who are in a &s;tation below mediocrity, as to tho&s;e who are very much removed above it: one may indeed di&s;patch his bu&s;i|ne&s;s &s;ooner than the other, but both of them are found at la&s;t to have done it &s;urely and effectually: but as it will naturally enough occur as a que&s;tion, what may really be the abu&s;e of wines or of &s;pirits, I will not he&s;itate to declare, that whenever it di&s;turbs the
<PB N="55" REF="54">animal economy, it mu&s;t be improper, and that the u&s;e of it at all will then con&s;titute its abu&s;e. I know very well, that in a &s;tate of health there are &s;ometimes certain condi|tions which require the u&s;e of wine or of &s;pirit; but if tho&s;e conditions frequently oc|cur, the occupation which produced them ought rather to be changed, than that the nece&s;&s;ity for the remedy &s;hould, by its repe|tition, by degrees at la&s;t convert it into a poi&s;on: For the natural antidote of languor and fatigue is re&s;t, and if we &s;ub&s;titute a re|medy, which by its &s;timulant powers com|pels the &s;y&s;tem to do more than in its ordi|nary &s;tate it is accu&s;tomed to perform, the con&s;titution mu&s;t at la&s;t break down, and di&s;|ea&s;e of &s;ome kind or other mu&s;t inevitably follow. The very con&s;tant cu&s;tom of drink|ing wine and &s;pirits has now indeed &s;o very much obtained, that one would almo&s;t think that they were equally nece&s;&s;ary to life as food; and that they were as conducive to ea&s;y and complete dige&s;tion, as they are in reality in the end de&s;tructive of it. I may very po&s;&s;ibly be told that there are numbers in the regular habit of taking all &s;orts of li|quors,
<PB N="56" REF="55">and who are living to a good old age, without experiencing any bad effects from them&mdash;but I would a&s;k, in return, whether they actually experience any good effects; whether one, who may thus be &s;aid to be fortunate, has not outlived an hundred in|&s;tances to the contrary&mdash;and whether the &s;in|gle example, which has thus happily re&s;i&s;ted injury, ought to be admitted as a fair argu|ment to prove the innocence of a cu&s;tom, when it is in the power of every medical practitioner to point out numbers who are daily becoming martyrs to it.</P>
<P>During this habitual and pernicious prac|tice, which might produce any of tho&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es which I have &s;aid mo&s;t commonly fol|low as the effects of it, the indulgence with re&s;pect to food determines it rather to be gout than any other. For the &s;tomach, al|ready enfeebled by being accu&s;tomed to the mo&s;t powerful &s;timulants, &s;eems now to re|li&s;h or to bear only that &s;ort of aliment which is immoderately &s;piced and &s;ea&s;oned, and which, if it yields any nutriment at all, mu&s;t afford it in con&s;equence of a hurried and in|complete dige&s;tion, from which there mu&s;t
<PB N="57" REF="56">nece&s;&s;arily be prepared a crude and vitiated chyle: and although probably in the natural and regular di&s;charge of the functions of the body any little error may, by the powers of the &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf, be corrected, yet where any organ has lo&s;t its energy, and the means which de&s;troyed it are &s;till continually ap|plied to it, we mu&s;t not expect that nature can any longer re&s;i&s;t &s;uch reiterated violence. But the&s;e indulgencies are often unavoidably connected with another circum&s;tance, which is almo&s;t equally injurious to the regular economy of the animal machine; the u&s;ual hours of re&s;t are generally encroached upon by a debauch; and when an opportunity of retiring at la&s;t arrives, &s;leep, which ought to renew his &s;trength for the various employ|ments of the &s;ucceeding day, if it comes at all, generally vi&s;its him in all the horrors of apoplectic &s;tertor, oppre&s;&s;ive colliquation, &s;ickne&s;s, dreams, and incubus.</P>
<P>From the ob&s;ervations which I have already made, it will ea&s;ily be &s;een that I con&s;ider a preternatural degree of irritability to be ge|nerated in the &s;y&s;tem as the effect of exce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus; and that the dige&s;tive faculties be|ing
<PB N="58" REF="57">thereby al&s;o deranged, chyle in an im|perfect &s;tate, is con&s;tantly forced upon the lacteals, and thence into the circulation, in a greater quantity than the ordinary offices of the intervening glands, and of the lungs are able to correct. An incongruous una&s;|&s;imilated fluid mu&s;t therefore every where be circulated, and expo&s;ed to the action of the &s;ecerning extremities of the arteries. Here indeed it may be modified and rendered more fit to enter by the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, where it is further modified before it is ultimately conveyed into the circulation again; but the body may be in &s;uch an extreme &s;tate of ir|ritability that the lymphatics, upon receiving this imperfect fluid, may thence immediately be di&s;turbed, their functions interrupted, con&s;triction produced, and pain, heat, red|ne&s;s and ten&s;ion follow. Gout therefore, ac|cording to this idea, may, as the common expre&s;&s;ion has it, be flying all over the body, for every lymphatic throughout the &s;y&s;tem may more or le&s;s be affected. If &s;ituated in a patient's extremities it is generally at|tended by the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms, which in an active &s;tate of the body con&s;titute it a re|gular
<PB N="59" REF="58">fit; but if <HI>mi&s;placed,</HI> or &s;eated in parts very e&s;&s;ential to life, the &s;ame activity of &s;y&s;tem immediately produces &s;uch imminent di&s;tre&s;s, that death, too frequently unexpect|ed, &s;uddenly de&s;troys him. I need not &s;ay that this is the gout which may rea&s;onably enough be denominated acute, &s;ince it is quick in its acce&s;&s;ion, and &s;peedy in its pro|gre&s;s. The &s;ame common cau&s;es which were enumerated as tending to bring on an attack of rheumati&s;m, may here al&s;o very likely co-operate, and &s;ix a man at once with a fit of the gout, which might other|wi&s;e have deferred its vi&s;it to a more di&s;tant period&mdash;for the con&s;titution &s;ometimes &s;uf|fers long under a variety of &s;ymptoms pro|ceeding from indige&s;tion and the want of a proper a&s;&s;imilation, until &s;uch occa&s;ional cau&s;es, concurring with the increa&s;ing irrita|bility of the &s;y&s;tem, at la&s;t render the di&s;ea&s;e more manife&s;t.</P>
<P>I might, perhaps, with more propriety of arrangement, have added above to the ex|ce&s;&s;es which become the foundation of an irritable and depraved &s;tate of the body, that any thing &s;uperadded to tho&s;e irregularities
<PB N="60" REF="59">which in its con&s;equences dimini&s;hes the vigour of the &s;y&s;tem, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily in|crea&s;e that irritability and deprativity: thus it has always been maintained that immoderate venery, and inten&s;e &s;tudy, as they are two principal cau&s;es of debility mu&s;t very con&s;i|derably augment any previou&s;ly exi&s;ting di&s;|po&s;ition to a gouty affection: but, I think al&s;o, that independent of &s;uch a previous di&s;|po&s;ition they may eventually produce the di&s;ea&s;e; for whatever debilitates the general frame mu&s;t debilitate its functions, and by that means ultimately induce not only pre|ternatural irritability of the &s;olids, but &s;uch a depravity of the humours, that may or may not terminate, as occa&s;ional cau&s;es may con&s;pire, in a fit of gout: I think too, that a con&s;tant anxiety of mind, accompanied with daily bodily fatigue (as, for example, mu&s;t inevitably happen in the profe&s;&s;ions of phy&s;ic and of law) may for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, even in early life, create &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, as when the frame grows old, and the powers of the &s;y&s;tem become weaker, may end, ac|cording to circum&s;tances, in actual gout: I know very well that &s;ome of my friends will
<PB N="61" REF="60">here &s;mile, and &s;ay, that in &s;peaking of cau&s;es, I have purpo&s;ely omitted to mention all the good living which profe&s;&s;ional men have the credit of enjoying with the world in general; but be that as it may, there cer|tainly are to be found &s;ome in&s;tances in both of them, as well as in &s;everal other very active employments, where from cau&s;es not at all connected with any &s;uch &s;ort of enjoy|ment, the gout torments a man who really does not &s;eem to have de&s;erved it: and, I believe al&s;o, that a &s;olitary in&s;tance may even now and then ari&s;e in per&s;ons of advanced age and irritable fibre, where from merely an alteration in the &s;tate of the lymphatic, by induration or o&s;&s;ification, the hands and feet &s;uddenly become &s;woln and painful, and a&s;&s;ume every appearance of a regular fit: But the gout which &s;eizes a patient under the &s;everal circum&s;tances which I have ju&s;t been endeavouring to de&s;cribe, is &s;eldom very violent in its attack, or very quick in its pro|gre&s;s. As it appears in debilitated habits, and is irregular in its acce&s;&s;ion, it has been u&s;ually called atonic gout, but as it is gene|rally of long duration, I would rather wi&s;h
<PB N="62" REF="61">to follow the analogy, and give it the appel|lation of chronic; for the &s;eat of it is the &s;ame with its kindred di&s;ea&s;e of rheumati&s;m, and like it too it continues through the remainder of life at uncertain intervals to di&s;tre&s;s the mi&s;erable &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>I have above mentioned, that the gout may be <HI>mi&s;placed,</HI> as it is commonly termed, and by &s;eizing upon &s;ome of the nobler parts immediately de&s;troy life; but I beg leave here to a&s;&s;ert it as my opinion, that either in the acute or chronic &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, the patient may &s;uddenly die without any attack of actual gout upon tho&s;e parts, without any mi&s;placement, without any retroce&s;&s;ion. I believe it will be admitted by all that there is both in health and in di&s;ea&s;e, a particular con&s;ent throughout the &s;y&s;tem, and a &s;ort of &s;ympathy exi&s;ting between di&s;tant parts, that when one is affected, another, without any direct communication, &s;hall be affected al&s;o. The di&s;location of a joint &s;hall be attended with &s;yncope; and an inflammation of the kidnies with vomiting:&mdash;an overcharged &s;tomach &s;hall produce headach, cholera &s;hall be accompanied with &s;pa&s;ms of the legs, and
<PB N="63" REF="62">a wound of the toe or &s;inger be followed by a locked-jaw, or even univer&s;al tetanus; and why may we not &s;uppo&s;e that in the exqui|&s;ite irritability of &s;y&s;tem which always ac|companies gout, that from cau&s;es which mu&s;t probably for ever remain inexplicable, the head, the lungs, the &s;tomach, or the inte&s;|tines, may al&s;o &s;ympathi&s;e with the di&s;tantly affected part in a &s;imilar manner?</P>
<P>It I were not afraid of entering into a conte&s;t about a matter of mere opinion (for which I have but little lei&s;ure, and le&s;s incli|nation) I &s;hould almo&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;pute the doctrine of hereditary gout: I will allow that it has attacked father and &s;on, from one generation to another, through a long &s;eries of years; but unle&s;s it can be &s;hewn that the education of the child has been correctly proper, and unle&s;s it can be proved that the &s;on has not lived as the father, I have a right to maintain that the gout might originate with the &s;on, as well as with the father be|fore him: and if it can be proved (as it may in a thou&s;and in&s;tances) that a gouty family by change of fortune&mdash;from a &s;tate of affluence to that of an inferior condition,
<PB N="64" REF="63">has ever lo&s;t the di&s;ea&s;e, we may then very ju&s;t|ly doubt the truth of the opinion. We hear every day from patients that their bilious di&s;orders are hereditary; but every phy|&s;ician knows that the &s;ecretion of the bile is di&s;turbed by cau&s;es evidently more rea&s;onable than the &s;uppo&s;ed inherent di&s;po&s;ition de|rived from their ance&s;tors: The drop&s;y, too, and &s;tone, and other di&s;ea&s;es which might be enumerated, have been reckoned heredi|tary for no better rea&s;ons: As well perhaps might the ague in the Hundreds of E&s;&s;ex be called hereditary, which ari&s;es from the very &s;ame general cau&s;e operating upon all; or the itch, which in &s;ome families &s;eems to be handed down as an heir-loom from generation to generation.</P>
<P>There is another very generally received opinion, which I cannot admit to be founded in fact, notwith&s;tanding it may be &s;tated upon the authority of almo&s;t every gouty per&s;on, that a paroxy&s;m of the gout is &s;alutary to the &s;y&s;tem, and relieves it from every other di&s;order. No one of the medical profe&s;&s;ion will doubt the veracity of Sydenham, who
<PB N="65" REF="64">tells us, that his repeated fits of the gout were at la&s;t accompanied with a di&s;ea&s;e equal|ly, or more deplorable, the &s;tone, and each of us might al&s;o, from our own ob&s;ervation, enumerate others; but a le&s;s temperate man than this our Engli&s;h Hippocrates, &s;trangely &s;uffers him&s;elf to become the dupe of a fan|ciful delu&s;ion, and boldly ru&s;hes amid&s;t pre|cipices, until he &s;uddenly tumbles down head-long: for he does not blu&s;h, by daily irre|gularity, to build upon that foundation which he has &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly been laying, and where &s;tructures, very different to that which he had intended, ari&s;e along with it. But there cannot, in any view of the matter, be the lea&s;t excu&s;e for his intemperance; for by this time he may a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf, if he has any reflexion, that he has unadvi&s;edly embraced what he now knows to be an error, and that the pernicious con&s;equences of the cu&s;tom are as certain as the plea&s;ures attending its commi&s;&s;ion are tran&s;ient. One would &s;up|po&s;e too that the gout, even if it really was the cure of every other di&s;order, afforded not, in the mi&s;ery which it brings along with it, any very great cau&s;e of exultation; and would rather heartily pity a man, than wi&s;h him
<PB N="66" REF="65">joy of the remedy in which he thus prides him&s;elf, and which he &s;ometimes has the hap|pine&s;s of trying, at lea&s;t, nine months out of the year. But the plan of admini&s;tering this remedy, although it be generally &s;o exactly &s;uited to his inclinations, does not &s;o well ac|cord with his con&s;titution: for wine and brandy, and &s;uch like &s;timulants, which in|variably con&s;titute the chief part of his regi|men, not only give the full effect to his fa|vourite di&s;ea&s;e, but undoubtedly very often produce other di&s;orders: vertigo, dy&s;pep&s;ia, tremor, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and all the inde&s;cribable marks of nervous and bilious affections, &s;oon begin to &s;hew them&s;elves, which being too frequently mi&s;taken for wandering and mi&s;|placed gout, call again, in the opinion of the mi&s;guided &s;ufferer, for fre&s;h quantities of the&s;e baneful cordials, which, in&s;tead of proving the antidote for tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, tend only the more to fix and to confirm them: jaundice, drop&s;y, mara&s;mus, haemorrhagy, hectic fever, and colli|quative &s;weats, teach him, too late, that to ob&s;tinacy in his error his life mu&s;t &s;oon be|come an inevitable &s;acrifice. Cordials then fail him, his &s;tomach nau&s;eates the &s;corching do&s;es, and none but the milde&s;t means, which
<PB N="67" REF="66">he has hitherto reprobated and neglected, can only now a little while unkindly prolong that mi&s;ery which death is anxiou&s;ly waiting to terminate.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of a fit of the gout, as I believe I have above mentioned, is quick or &s;low, according as it may be influenced by particular circum&s;tances; for if the &s;y&s;tem be acting &s;trongly and vigorou&s;ly, the limb (as in rheumati&s;m) will &s;well, become red, and exce&s;&s;ively painful, and, in the cour&s;e of a few days, again &s;ub&s;ide, and recover gra|dually its proper functions: but if the con|&s;titution has already been much impaired by repeated attacks, or has previou&s;ly been debi|litated from other cau&s;es, the gout, though attended with &s;ymptoms &s;ufficiently painful, does not proceed with that rapidity which would characteri&s;e it as the acute gout, but &s;lowly and irregularly, like a truly chronic di&s;ea&s;e, advances towards its termination: And here I mu&s;t take occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve&mdash; that whether in its acute or chronic &s;tate, this di&s;ea&s;e, like the rheumati&s;m, mu&s;t end either by the lymphatic recovering its proper of|fice, or by collateral channels vicariou&s;ly di&s;|charging its duty, or by the fluid being ef|fu&s;ed
<PB N="68" REF="67">into the adjacent cellular texture in con&s;equence of its rupture&mdash;where, from the di&s;&s;ipation of its thinner parts, it concretes into an indurated ma&s;s, and is vulgarly called a chalk &s;tone.</P>
<P>Upon the cure of a di&s;ea&s;e, which com|mon opinion almo&s;t &s;uppo&s;es to be incurable, you mu&s;t not expect me to deliver any thing very deci&s;ive. The prejudices of the multi|tude are always oppo&s;ed to the experience of the few; and therefore what you and others of the medical profe&s;&s;ion may concur with me in con&s;idering as proper and cor|rect, the world in general will very probably di&s;regard as trifling and hypothetical. Whil&s;t I profe&s;s my&s;elf therefore to be one of tho&s;e who think that the gout may be often alle|viated by other means than patience and flannel, I do not expect to be implicitly be|lieved: and when the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of a patient have induced him to entertain the idea that nothing el&s;e can be done for him, I would rather give him up to his own remedies, which will often undoubtedly afford him very great a&s;&s;i&s;tance, than pre&s;s any method upon him in which he had not a rea&s;onable confidence, and con&s;equently in which he
<PB N="69" REF="68">could not be expected unremittingly to per|&s;erve.</P>
<P>During a fit of the gout it is in vain to at|tempt any thing more than a mitigation of the exi&s;ting di&s;tre&s;s: it is only after the pa|roxy&s;m has cea&s;ed that the expectation of a complete cure can rationally be entertain|ed.</P>
<P>For the &s;ake of arrangement we will &s;up|po&s;e a man ju&s;t &s;eized, for the fir&s;t time, with a regular fit of the gout in his hand or foot, accompanied with the u&s;ual &s;ymp|toms attendant upon pain and tumefaction: Although it may not be &s;o very exactly mark|ed as to di&s;tingui&s;h it at once from rheuma|ti&s;m, or from rheumatic gout, a name, by the bye, which &s;eems to have been invented to cover the difficulty of nicer di&s;crimination; yet if the circulation be found quick, the &s;kin hot, the mouth dry or clammy, and the mind, as well as body, in a &s;tate of re&s;tle&s;&s;|ne&s;s and agitation, there will be a &s;ufficient a&s;&s;emblage of &s;ymptoms to determine a phy&s;i|cian in his method of cure. I &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e that nothing very materially different from the plan which was laid down as u&s;eful in the active &s;tate of acute rheumati&s;m could
<PB N="70" REF="69">here be thought wrong, and that relaxant and diluent remedies, aided by moderate external heat, could not be improper: The general irritability of the &s;y&s;tem will demand al&s;o a proportionate do&s;e of a &s;edative medi|cine, and con&s;tipation mu&s;t be prevented by the &s;ea&s;onable u&s;e of purgatives. The pro|per admini&s;tration of &s;uch a method will com|monly produce an alleviation of all the &s;ymp|toms, and a little time, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of proper tonics, will u&s;ually complete the cure. But by the frequent repetition of &s;uch at|tacks, as the &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t now be con&s;iderably debilitated, we will &s;uppo&s;e its uniformity greatly interrupted, and in&s;tead of the re|gular &s;welling, and the commonly continued degree of torture, the appearance of the tu|mefaction &s;hall be ambiguous, and the pain variable and incon&s;tant. And here, in this irregular &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, with a body almo&s;t worn out, and a mind equally &s;hat|tered and enervated, what concurrence of &s;ymptoms &s;hall I de&s;cribe, from which we may rea&s;onably deduce any curative inten|tion? What Sydenham calls an unconnected and di&s;orderly &s;et of phenomena, <HI>(farrago quoedam <GAP DESC="foreign"> incompo&s;ita atque inordinata)</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="70">and which he applies &s;o properly to hy&s;teri|cal affections, may give &s;ome idea of that contrariety of &s;ymptoms which very often appears in a fit of irregular and chronic gout. If indeed this very confu&s;ion it&s;elf does not afford us the be&s;t indication of the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, I am at lea&s;t &s;ure that &s;ome phy|&s;icians, and tho&s;e of no mean account, are di&s;po&s;ed to think that a better characteri&s;tic of it is &s;till wanting, and therefore do not he&s;itate to call it gout, becau&s;e they cannot with certainty &s;o develope the &s;ymptoms as to denominate it any other di&s;ea&s;e. The dy&s;peptic condition of the &s;tomach, the pa|ralytic tremors of the limbs, the convul&s;ive twitchings of the mu&s;cles, the relaxed joints, the frequent &s;yncope, the interrupted re&s;pi|ration, the apoplectic vertigo, the oedematous extremities, the univer&s;al mara&s;mus, and the de&s;pondency of mind, are all of them, (and more indeed might be added to the ca|talogue) the genuine marks of the chronic &s;tate of this di&s;ea&s;e; and as they mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily call for their own appropriate remedies, no general method of cure can be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed as applicable to them all. I cannot there|fore attempt to introduce any certain and
<PB N="72" REF="71">&s;pecific plan for the relief of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;o accompanied, but will con&s;ider the &s;everal circum&s;tances as they ari&s;e according to my own therapeutic cla&s;&s;ification.</P>
<P>The a&s;tringent order of medicines, ina&s;|much as it may &s;ometimes indirectly an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of tonics, as I have above en|deavoured to explain when treating of rheu|mati&s;m, may occa&s;ionally be u&s;ed when the &s;y&s;tem is labouring under the evident effects of debility, when the dige&s;tive organs tar|dily perform their functions, and the bodily &s;trength is &s;till wa&s;ting by colliquative per|&s;pirations. I will not unnece&s;&s;arily extend this letter by mentioning particular remedies, as the choice of each mu&s;t be directed by circum&s;tances not only depending upon the period of the di&s;ea&s;e and the con&s;titution of the patient, but upon a variety of others which can only be known as they are com|bined with, and ari&s;e out of, the occa&s;ion of admini&s;tering them: and in this I am confi|dent, that every phy&s;ician who practi&s;es upon a rational and comprehen&s;ive &s;cale will agree with me, whatever may be the opinion of tho&s;e who con&s;ult their memorandum-book,
<PB N="73" REF="72">rather than their judgment, and look for a no&s;trum ready prepared and manufactured, in&s;tead of examining the ca&s;e, and then adopt|ing a formula from the plain dictates of a common under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The emollient cla&s;s may certainly be very well employed, whenever there may be ten|&s;ion and con&s;equent pain, whether the di&s;ea&s;e be of the acute or chronic kind&mdash;and any of tho&s;e external means which are calculated to &s;often the part without impeding per&s;pi|ration, or any other office of the &s;kin, will be proper.</P>
<P>Stimulants in the acute &s;tate of gout, notwith&s;tanding their u&s;e has &s;o very com|monly obtained, both in the practice of al|mo&s;t every patient, and in the recommenda|tion of almo&s;t every phy&s;ician, cannot &s;urely be entitled to &s;uch a general approbation from the actual experience of either. They have adopted the remedy becau&s;e it is plea&s;ant and cu&s;tomary, not becau&s;e it is good and &s;er|viceable. For if they practi&s;e upon the old idea, that gout is a di&s;ea&s;e highly inflam|matory, one would &s;uppo&s;e it impo&s;&s;ible that Brandy and Madeira could be cho&s;en as the proper remedies to dimini&s;h its activity; and
<PB N="74" REF="73">if the opinion which I have entertained of the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e be thought by them in anywi&s;e con&s;onant to rea&s;on, they will ea&s;ily al&s;o agree with me in thinking, that the indi&s;criminate u&s;e of &s;timulants cannot mitigate it: but in the chronic &s;tate of this di&s;ea&s;e, where the debility is extreme, where dy&s;pep&s;ia greatly oppre&s;&s;es the patient, and where there is a general tardine&s;s in the per|formance of the ordinary functions, I am very far from &s;uppo&s;ing that a regularly and properly admini&s;tered &s;timulant, which pro|duces a con&s;tant, equal, and uniform action throughout the &s;y&s;tem, can be wrong, when innumerable examples of the contrary are occurring every day: Upon this principle, I &s;uppo&s;e, that bli&s;ters and &s;inapi&s;ms, which are commonly applied to the extremities, may be u&s;eful; for &s;o long as they contri|bute towards promoting a greater degree of energy in the habit, they may be of ad|vantage to it.</P>
<P>I think there can be very little doubt about the propriety of admitting the cla&s;s of &s;eda|tives into the method of cure for the gout, whether it be acute or chronic: for pain mu&s;t in either ca&s;e be mitigated; and as we know
<PB N="75" REF="74">that in the mo&s;t active &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, opium and the re&s;t may be very well com|bined with tho&s;e medicines which are cal|culated to dimini&s;h the power and force of the &s;y&s;tem, &s;o may they al&s;o, with an equal degree of fitne&s;s, be joined with tho&s;e which correct its irregularity, and re&s;tore to it its firmne&s;s and its &s;tability. In the common at|tack therefore upon the &s;tomach, and indeed upon other parts where the idea of mi&s;placed gout has u&s;ually called for the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ti|mulants in very immoderate quantities, I would rather tru&s;t to a &s;edative for imme|diate relief, either alone or in conjunction with other medicines, as circum&s;tances might then indicate and &s;eem to require.</P>
<P>The weak and debilitated &s;tate to which patients are &s;ometimes reduced by a long continued fit of the gout, and in which we generally find them during the tedious lin|gering attack of it in its chronic form, de|mands the u&s;e of tonics&mdash;and therefore the Peruvian bark, and bitters, and other &s;trength|ening remedies, will here maintain their place and character as very u&s;eful.</P>
<P>The relaxant cla&s;s will always merit con|&s;iderable attention in the fir&s;t attack of the
<PB N="76" REF="75">acute gout. The vigor and activity which then prevail in the &s;y&s;tem&mdash;the quickened circulation, the general heat and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, the thir&s;t, and other febrile &s;ymptoms, all require the immediate exhibition of relax|ants: and the neutralized &s;aline remedies, an|timonials, and others which relax the &s;y&s;|tem without heating it, will be given with manife&s;t advantage. I have no great doubt upon my mind, that under the above circum|&s;tances, phlebotomy might very often be pro|ductive of con&s;iderable benefit to the patient, notwith&s;tanding its u&s;e appears not yet &s;ufficient|ly to have obtained in practice&mdash;for in all the doubtful ca&s;es where it has not been exactly determined whether the di&s;ea&s;e was gout or rheumati&s;m, and where phlebotomy has been employed as the cure, it has evidently re|lieved; and it would be ridiculous to allow, in matters of ambiguity, that the chance has always fallen on the right di&s;ea&s;e, and that bleeding, which we &s;ometimes judge proper in rheumati&s;m, has invariably (and although we found it &s;o very difficult to di&s;criminate) been performed in one, and never in the other. I will not however pre&s;s the opinion,
<PB N="77" REF="76">which both rea&s;on and analogy have thus induced me to &s;upport, &s;ince no one will &s;uppo&s;e that there are not many ca&s;es of gout in which its u&s;e may be very hazard|ous, and many in which it would be ab&s;o|lutely hurtful; for it is only in the very acute &s;tage of this di&s;ea&s;e, where the body has not been previou&s;ly reduced by general irregularity, but is &s;trong and vigorous, that I &s;hould ever con&s;ider the nece&s;&s;ity of venae|&s;ection: in all ca&s;es, otherwi&s;e circum&s;tanced, there cannot po&s;&s;ibly be a doubt about its im|propriety.&mdash;The topical application of leeches, where the limb is greatly loaded and di&s;tend|ed, I have never found injurious; but on the contrary, I might perhaps &s;ay, that I have always found it beneficial.</P>
<P>Diluents and demulcents, whether we con|&s;ider them merely as vehicles for more effica|cious remedies, or as capable them&s;elves of correcting or altering the &s;tate of the circu|lating fluids, cannot in any &s;tage of the di&s;|ea&s;e be improper.</P>
<P>As to the other cla&s;&s;es of remedies which may or may not be requi&s;ite, as the &s;tate of the con&s;titution may or may not be influenced by the di&s;ea&s;e under which it labours, I do
<PB N="78" REF="77">not think it of any importance to endeavour to call your particular attention towards them; for every one readily knows when there is any nece&s;&s;ity for their exhibition.</P>
<P>The protuberances which often appear upon the extremities in con&s;equence of a &s;evere fit of the gout, and which, I have before ob&s;erved, have been denominated chalk-&s;tones, as they &s;ometimes degenerate into ulcers very difficult of cure, will frequently require the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ur|gery. I have no opinion of the utility of the marine acid bath in &s;uch ca&s;es, notwith&s;tanding it has been much employed upon the Continent, and lately recommended here: for unle&s;s the&s;e protuberances can be proved to con&s;i&s;t of un|combined calcareous earth, as their name would import, but of which as detached from pho&s;|phoric acid I believe there exi&s;ts not a &s;ingle particle, the marine acid cannot ea&s;ily affect them without equally de&s;troying the interme|diate and connecting animal fibres.</P>
<P>When the paroxy&s;m has completely cea&s;ed, if the patient has the re&s;olution to enter upon a very &s;trict regimen, he may generally prevent its recurrence. I mu&s;t be under&s;tood to &s;peak of &s;uch ca&s;es only where the gout has properly &s;ub|&s;ided, and where the parts being entire are again performing their functions perfectly: Herethen,
<PB N="79" REF="78">if he determines upon ab&s;tinence from every thing which &s;timulates, and which in the end mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly produces a morbid irritability of the &s;y&s;tem; if he is moderate in his plea&s;ures, his bu&s;ine&s;s and his exerci&s;e; if he &s;trictly denies him&s;elf every kind of &s;pirituous, vinous, or other fermented liquor; if he &s;teadily adheres to a milk and vegetable diet; if he ob&s;erves early hours, &s;upports a regular warmth of body, and keeps the pa&s;&s;ions of the mind equal and undi&s;turbed, he will, I have no doubt, not only de&s;erve a cure, but find it: and in the chronic &s;tate like|wi&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e it might be well for him to con&s;ider, whether a general plan of forbearance and moderation might not better alleviate the mi&s;eries which always accompany it, than the contrary habit, which too commonly prevails; and whether a di&s;ea&s;e, which when thus fixed affords us but little hope of eradicating it, may not however be rendered much more &s;evere and intolerable by the many additional evils which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e from intemperance.</P>
<P>After having thus brought my letter to its conclu&s;ion, I have only to hope that in the cour&s;e of it I have not manife&s;ted an inde|corous pre&s;umption in delivering particular
<PB N="80" REF="79">opinions, nor betrayed an unrea&s;onable confi|dence in maintaining them. What I have written has been &s;ugge&s;ted entirely by ca&s;es which have fallen under my own care: and if any ob&s;ervations have been made which do not exactly accord with former theories, I can only &s;ay, that they are the re&s;ult of reflexions which have been faithfully copied from prac|tice: I may be wrong, but I am not con&s;cious of my error. Let me therefore tru&s;t, if better information than that which I have hitherto acquired &s;hould detect my mi&s;takes, that it will be advanced with temper, and urged again&s;t me with liberality; for the cau&s;e of &s;cience is be&s;t promoted by candid di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and calm inve&s;tigation.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honour to be, DEAR SIR, With the greate&s;t re&s;pect, Your very obedient, And much obliged humble &s;ervant, J. LATHAM.</SIGNED>
