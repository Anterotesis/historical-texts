<P>_AMONG the &s;everal degrees of authors, there are none perhaps,
who have more ob&s;tacles to &s;urmount at their &s;etting out, than the
writers of periodical e&s;&s;ays. Talk with a modern critic, and he will tell
you, that to &s;et up a new paper is a vain attempt after the inimitable
SPECTATORS and others; that the &s;ubjects are already pre|occupied, and that
it is equally impo&s;&s;ible to find out a new field for ob&s;ervation, as to
di&s;cover a new world. With the&s;e prejudices the public are prepared to
receive us; and while they expect to be cloyed with the &s;tale repetition of
the &s;ame fare, though to&s;&s;ed up in a different manner, they have but
little reli&s;h for the entertainment.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="3">THAT the SPECTATOR fir&s;t led the way,
mu&s;t undoubt|edly be acknowledged: but that his followers mu&s;t for that
rea&s;on be always &s;uppo&s;ed to tread in his &s;teps, can by no means be
allowed. In the high road of life there are &s;everal exten&s;ive walks, as
well as bye-paths, which we may &s;trike into, without the nece&s;&s;ity of
keeping the &s;ame beaten track with tho&s;e that have gone before us. New
objects for ridicule will continually pre&s;ent them&s;elves; and even the
&s;ame characters will appear different by being differently di&s;po&s;ed, as
in the &s;ame pack of cards, though ever &s;o often &s;huffled, there will
never be two hands exactly alike.</P>
<P>AFTER this introduction I hope to be pardoned, if I in|dulge
my&s;elf in &s;peaking a word or two concerning my own endeavours to entertain
the public; which I imagine I could never do with &s;o good a grace, as at the
beginning of my &s;econd volume. And fir&s;t, whatever objections the reader
may have had to the &s;ubjects of my papers, I &s;hall make no apology for the
manner in which I have cho&s;e to treat them. The dread of falling into (what
they are plea&s;ed to call) colloquial barbari&s;ms has induced &s;ome
un&s;kilful writers to &s;well their bloated diction with uncouth phra&s;es and
the affected jargon of pedants. For my own part, I never go out of the common
way of expre&s;&s;ion, merely for the &s;ake of introducing a more &s;ounding
word with a <HI>Latin</HI> termination. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> language is
&s;ufficiently co|pious and expre&s;&s;ive without any further adoption of new
terms; and the native words &s;eem to me to have far more force than any
foreign auxiliaries, however pompou&s;ly u&s;hered in: as <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
&s;oldiers fight our battles better than the troops taken into our pay.</P>
<P><PB N="423" REF="4">THE &s;ubjects of my e&s;&s;ays have been
chiefly &s;uch, as I thought might recommend them&s;elves to the public notice
by being new and uncommon. For this rea&s;on I purpo&s;ely avoided the worn out
practice of retailing &s;craps of mora|lity, and affecting to dogmatize on the
common duties of life. In this point, indeed, the SPECTATOR is inimitable; nor
could I hope to &s;ay any thing new upon the&s;e topics after &s;o many
excellent moral and religious e&s;&s;ays, which, are the principal ornament of
his work. I have therefore contented my&s;elf with expo&s;ing vice and folly by
painting the actors in their natural colours, without a&s;&s;uming the
rigidne&s;s of a preacher, or the moro&s;ene&s;s of a philo&s;opher. I have
oftener cho&s;e to undermine our fa&s;hionable exce&s;&s;es by &s;ecret
&s;apping, than to &s;torm them by open a&s;&s;aults. In a word, upon all
occa&s;ions I have endeavoured to laugh peo|ple into a better behaviour; as I
am convinced, that the &s;ting of reproof is not le&s;s &s;harp for being
concealed; and advice never comes with a better face, than when it comes with a
laughing one.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome points in the cour&s;e of this work, which
perhaps might have been treated of with a more &s;erious air. I have thought it
my duty to take every opportunity of ex|po&s;ing the ab&s;urd tenets of our
modern free-thinkers and enthu&s;ia&s;ts. The enthu&s;ia&s;t is, indeed, much
more difficult to cure than the free-thinker; becau&s;e the latter, with all
his bravery, cannot but be con&s;cious that he is wrong; whereas the former has
perhaps deceived him&s;elf into a be|lief, that he is certainly in the right,
and the more he is op|po&s;ed, the more he con&s;iders him&s;elf as 
<Q REND="inline">"patiently &s;uffer|ing for the truth's
&s;ake."</Q> Ignorance is too &s;tubborn to yield to conviction; and on the
other hand tho&s;e, whom <PB N="424" REF="5"> 
<Q REND="inline">"a little learning has made mad,"</Q> are too
proud and &s;elf|&s;ufficient to hearken to the &s;ober voice of rea&s;on. The
only way left us, therefore, is to root out &s;uper&s;tition, by making its
followers a&s;hamed of them&s;elves: and as for our free-thinkers, it is but
right to turn their boa&s;ted weapons of ridicule again&s;t them; and as they
them|&s;elves endeavour to banter all others out of their &s;erious and
virtuous notions, we too (in the language of the P&s;almi&s;t) &s;hould 
<Q REND="inline">"laugh them to &s;corn, and have them in
deri&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P>BUT whatever merit I may a&s;&s;ume to my&s;elf from my
writings, I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time confe&s;s my&s;elf indebted to &s;everal
corre&s;pondents for many excellent pieces; and more particularly to the
gentlemen, who have &s;igned them&s;elves A. B. and G. K. As I know not the
real names of any of my corre&s;pondents, I am not without &s;ome hopes, that I
have been honoured by an Earl or a Right Honourable at lea&s;t: for to &s;ay
the truth, I cannot at pre&s;ent apply to my&s;elf the known boa&s;t of
<HI>Terence,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;Homines nobiles</L> 
<L>Eum adjutare, a&s;&s;idu&egrave;que un&agrave;
&s;cribere.</L></Q></P>
<P>IT is with infinite plea&s;ure, that I find my&s;elf &s;o much
encouraged to continue my labours, by the kind reception which they have
hitherto met with from the public: and Mr. <HI>Baldwin</HI> with no le&s;s
plea&s;ure informs me, that as there are but few numbers left of the pre&s;ent
edition, he intends to collect them into Two Pocket Volumes. The reader cannot
conceive, how much I already pride my&s;elf on the charming figure, which my
works will make in this new <PB N="425" REF="6"> form: and I &s;hall endeavour
to render the&s;e volumes as complete as I po&s;&s;ibly can, by &s;everal
con&s;iderable additions and amendments. Though contracted into the &s;mall
&s;pace of a twelves volume, I &s;till hope to maintain my former dignity; like
the Devils in <HI>Milton's Pandaemonium,</HI> who, 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;To &s;malle&s;t forms</L> 
<L>Reduc'd their &s;hapes immen&s;e, and were at
large.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE SPECTATOR has very elegantly compared his &s;ingle papers,
as they came out, to 
<Q REND="inline">"cherries on a &s;tick,"</Q> of the dearne&s;s
of which the purcha&s;ers cannot complain, who are willing to gratify their
ta&s;te with choice fruit at its earlie&s;t production. I have con&s;idered my
own papers as &s;o many flowers, which joined together would make up a pretty
no&s;egay; and though each of them, &s;ingly taken, may not be equally admired
for their odours, they may receive an additional fragrance by an happy union of
their &s;weets.</P>
<P>CUSTOM hath lately introduced a new fa&s;hion among
e&s;&s;ay-writers, of giving tran&s;lations of the mottos for the benefit of
the ladies. But (as <HI>Denham</HI> has remarked of tran&s;lation in general) 
<Q REND="inline">"the &s;pirit of the original is evapo|rated in
the transfu&s;ion, and nothing is left behind but a mere <HI>caput
mortuum.</HI>"</Q> Tran&s;lations, however, mu&s;t be given; and it has been
the u&s;ual way to copy them pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly from <HI>Dryden</HI> or
<HI>Francis:</HI> though they are gene|rally very wide of the intended
&s;en&s;e of the original, and not unfrequently nothing to the purpo&s;e. For
this rea&s;on I de|&s;ign to give new tran&s;lations, or rather imitations, of
all the mottos and quotations, adapted to the pre&s;ent times. Some of the&s;e
will admit of epigrammatic turns; and many of <PB N="426" REF="7"> them will
afford room for lively and picture&s;que allu|&s;ions to modern manners. In
this dre&s;s they will at lea&s;t appear more of a piece with the e&s;&s;ays
them&s;elves; and not like the patch-work of random tran&s;lations.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, I &s;hall only add, that if any Noble|man,
Gentleman, or Rich Citizen, is ambitious to have his name prefixed to either of
the&s;e volumes, he is de&s;ired to &s;end in propo&s;als, together with a
li&s;t of his virtues and good qualities, to the publi&s;her; and the
Dedications &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed of to the be&s;t bidder.</P>
<P>&dtristar;None but principals will be treated with.</P>

<P>_THE managers of our Public Gardens, willing to make their
&s;ummer diver&s;ions as com|plete as po&s;&s;ible, are not content with laying
out beautiful walks, and providing an excel|lent band of mu&s;ic, but are
al&s;o at much expence to amu&s;e us with the old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
entertainment of Ballad-&s;inging. For this end they not only retain the be&s;t
voices that can be procured, but each of them al&s;o has a poet in ordinary,
who is allowed a &s;tated &s;alary, and the run of the Gardens. The productions
of the&s;e petty lau|reats naturally come within my notice as CRITIC; and,
indeed, whether I am at <HI>Vauxhall, Ranelagh, Marybone,</HI> or even
<HI>Sadler's Wells,</HI> I indulge my&s;elf in many remarks on the poetry of
the place; and am as attentive to the &s;ongs as to the Ca&s;cade, the
Fireworks, or Mi&s;s <HI>I&s;abella Wilkin&s;on.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="9">BALLADS &s;eem peculiarly adapted to the
genius of our people; and are a &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, in which we are
&s;uperior to all other nations. Many of our old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Songs have
in them an affecting &s;implicity; and it is re|markable, that our be&s;t
writers have not been a&s;hamed to cultivate this branch of poetry. <HI>Cowley,
Waller; Rofcommon, Rowe, Gay, Prior,</HI> and many others, have left behind
them very elegant Ballads; but it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, to the honour of the
pre&s;ent age, that it was re&s;erved for our modern writers to bring this kind
of poetry to perfection. Song-writing is now reduced to certain rules of art,
and the Ballad-maker goes to work by a method as regular and me|chanical, as a
carpenter or a black&s;mith.</P>
<P>SWIFT, in his "Voyage to <HI>Laputa,</HI>" de&s;cribes a
ma|chine to write books in all arts and &s;ciences: I have al&s;o read of a
mill to make ver&s;es; and remember to have &s;een a curious table, by the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which the mo&s;t illiterate might amu&s;e them&s;elves in
compo&s;ing hexameters and pentameters in <HI>Latin:</HI> Inventions
wonderfully calculated for the promotion of literature. Whatever gentlemen of
<HI>Grub-&s;treet</HI> or others are ambitious to inli&s;t them&s;elves as
hackney &s;onetteers, are de&s;ired to attend to the following rules, drawn
from the practice of our modern &s;ong-writers: a &s;et of geniu&s;&s;es
excellent in their manner, and who will probably be hereafter as much known and
admired as Garden-Poets, as the celebrated <HI>Taylor</HI> is now famous under
the denomination of Water-Poet.</P>
<P>I MUST beg leave po&s;&s;itively to contradict any reports,
in&s;inuating that our Ballad-makers are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a
machine, mill, or table as above-mentioned; and believe <PB N="429" REF="10">
it to be equally fal&s;e, that it is their practice to hu&s;tle certain quaint
terms and phra&s;es together in a hat, and take them out at random. It has,
indeed, been a&s;&s;erted on &s;ome ju&s;t ground, that their productions are
totally void of &s;en&s;e and expre&s;&s;ion, that they have little rhyme and
le&s;s rea&s;on, and that they are from beginning to end nothing more than
non&s;en&s;ical rhap&s;odies to a new tune. This charge I do not mean to deny:
though I cannot but lament the deplorable want of ta&s;te, that mentions it as
a fault. For it is this very circum&s;tance, which I, who am profe&s;&s;edly a
CONNOISSEUR, particularly admire. It is a received maxim with all compo&s;ers
of mu&s;ic, that nothing is &s;o melodious as non&s;en&s;e. Manly &s;en&s;e is
too har&s;h and &s;tubborn to go through the numberle&s;s divi&s;ions and
&s;ub|divi&s;ions of modern mu&s;ic, and to be trilled forth in crotchets and
demiquavers. For this rea&s;on, thought is &s;o cautiou&s;ly &s;prinkled over a
modern &s;ong; which it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;inger to warble into
harmony and &s;entiment.</P>
<P>OUR Ballad-makers for the mo&s;t part &s;lide into the familiar
&s;tile, and affect that ea&s;y manner of writing, which (accord|ing to
<HI>Wycherley)</HI> is ea&s;ily written. Seeing the dangerous con&s;equence of
meaning, in words adapted to mu&s;ic, they are very frugal of &s;entiment: and
indeed they hu&s;band it &s;o well, that the &s;ame thoughts are adapted to
every &s;ong. The only variation requi&s;ite in twenty ballads is, that the
la&s;t line of the &s;tanza be different. In this ingenious line the wit of the
whole &s;ong con&s;i&s;ts; and the author, whether <HI>he &s;hall die if he has
not the la&s;s of the mill,</HI> or <HI>de&s;erves to be reckon'd an
a&s;s,</HI> turns over his dictionary of rhymes for words of a &s;imilar
&s;ound, and every ver&s;e jingles to the &s;ame word <PB N="430" REF="11">
with all the agreeable variety of a &s;et of bells eternally ring|ing the
&s;ame peal.</P>
<P>THE authors of love-&s;ongs formerly wa&s;ted a great deal of
poetry in illu&s;trating their own pa&s;&s;ion and the beauty of their
mi&s;tre&s;s; but our modern poets content them&s;elves with falling in love
with her name. There cannot be a greater misfortune to one of the&s;e rhymers
than a mi&s;tre&s;s with a hard name; &s;uch a misfortune &s;ends them all over
the world and makes them run through all arts, &s;ciences, and languages for
corre&s;pondent terms: and after all per|haps the name is &s;o har&s;h and
untractable, that our poet has as much difficulty to bring it into ver&s;e, as
the cele|braters of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> were puzzled to reduce to
rhyme the uncouth names of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Towns taken in Queen
<HI>Anne</HI>'s wars. <HI>Valentine</HI> in <HI>Love for Love,</HI> when he
talks of turning poet, orders <HI>Jeremy</HI> to get the maids together of an
evening to Crambo: no contemptible hint to our Ballad|makers, and which, if
properly made u&s;e of, would be of as much &s;ervice to them as <HI>By&s;he's
Art of Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>FEARING le&s;t this method of &s;ong-writing &s;hould one day
grow ob&s;olete, in order to pre&s;erve to po&s;terity &s;ome idea of it, I
have put together the following dialogue as a &s;pecimen of the modern manner.
I mu&s;t, however, be in|genuous enough to confe&s;s, that I can claim no
farther me|rit in this elegant piece than that of a compiler. It is a Canto
from our mo&s;t celebrated new &s;ongs; from which I have carefully culled all
the &s;weete&s;t flowers of poetry, and bound them up together for the delight
and wonder of the world. As all the lines are taken from different &s;ongs
&s;et to different tunes, I would humbly propo&s;e that this curious 
<PB N="431" REF="12"> performance &s;hould be &s;ung jointly by all the be&s;t
voices, in the manner of a <HI>Dutch</HI> concert, where every man &s;ings his
own tune. I had once &s;ome thoughts of affixing mar|ginal references to each
line, to inform the reader by note at what place the &s;ong whence it is taken
was fir&s;t &s;ung. But I &s;hall &s;pare my&s;elf that trouble by de&s;iring
the reader to look on the whole piece as ari&s;ing from a coalition of our
mo&s;t eminent &s;ong-writers at <HI>Vauxhall, Ranelagh, Mary|bone,</HI> and
<HI>Sadler's Wells:</HI> a&s;&s;uring him, that this &s;hort dia|logue contains
the pith and marrow, or rather (to borrow an expre&s;&s;ion from the Fine Lady
in <HI>Lethe)</HI> the <HI>Quin&s;etence</HI> and <HI>Emptity</HI> of all our

<P>_WALKING the other, day in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Abbey, among
the many oftentatious monu|ments erected to kings and warriors, I could not
help ob&s;erving a little &s;tone, on which was this pompous
in&s;cription&mdash;<HI>Aeternae Memoriae Sacrum</HI>&mdash;Sacred to the
Eternal Memory of &mdash;. The name of the per&s;on, to whom immortality was
thus &s;ecured, is almo&s;t obliterated; and perhaps, when alive, he was little
known, and as &s;oon forgot by the &s;mall circle of his friends and
acquaintance.</P>
<P>I HAVE been u&s;ed to look upon epitaphs as a kind of flattering
dedications to the dead; in which is &s;et down a long catalogue of virtues,
(that nobody knew they were <PB N="434" REF="15"> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of while
living) and not a word of their vices or follies. The veracity of the&s;e
po&s;thumous encomiums may, indeed, be fairly &s;u&s;pected, as we are
generally told, that the di&s;con&s;olate widow, or weeping &s;on, erected the
monu|ment in te&s;timony of their affliction for the lo&s;s of the kind|e&s;t
hu&s;band, or mo&s;t affectionate father. But what dowager, who gets a
comfortable jointure by her good man's decea&s;e, would refu&s;e to &s;et her
hand to it on his tomb-&s;tone, that he was the be&s;t of hu&s;bands; though
perhaps they had parted beds? or what heir would be &s;o ba&s;e and ungrateful,
as not to give a few good words to a crabbed parent after his death, in return,
for his e&s;tate?</P>
<P>BY the extravagant prai&s;es, which are indi&s;criminately
lavi&s;hed on the a&s;hes of every per&s;on alike, we entirely pervert the
original intent of epitaphs, which were contrived to do honour and ju&s;tice to
the virtuous and the good: But by the pre&s;ent practice the reputations of men
are equally con|founded with their du&s;t in the grave, where there is no
di&s;|tinction between the good and the bad. The law has ap|pointed &s;earchers
to enquire, when any one dies, into the cau&s;e of his death: in the &s;ame
manner I could wi&s;h, that &s;earchers were appointed to examine into his way
of living, before a character be given of him upon the tomb-&s;tone.</P>
<P>THE flatteries, that are paid to the decea&s;ed, are
un|doubtedly owing to the pride of their &s;urvivors, which is the &s;ame among
the lowe&s;t as the highe&s;t &s;et of people. When an ob&s;cure grocer or
tallow-chandler dies at his lodg|ings at <HI>I&s;lington,</HI> the news-papers
are &s;tuffed with the &s;ame parade of his virtues and good qualities, as when
a duke, goes out of the world: and the petty over&s;eer of a little 
<PB N="435" REF="16"> hamlet has a painted board with the initials of his name
&s;tuck up at the end of his wicker'd turf, while the noblemen repo&s;es under
a grand mau&s;oleum erected to his memory, with a long li&s;t of his titles and
heroic deeds.</P>
<P>THE Great, indeed, have found means to &s;eparate them|&s;elves
even in their graves from the vulgar, by having their a&s;hes depo&s;ited in
churches and cathedrals, and covered by the mo&s;t &s;uperb monuments. In my
late vi&s;it to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Abby, I could not but remark the
difference of Ta&s;te, which has prevailed in &s;etting up the&s;e edifices for
the dead. In former times, we find, that they were content to clap up the
bu&s;t or &s;tatue of the decea&s;ed, &s;et round perhaps with the emblems of
his merits, his employment, or &s;tation of life. If any per&s;on was
remarkable for his virtue and piety, it was pointed out by two or three little
chubby-faced che|rubims, who were crying for his death, or holding a crown over
his head. The warriour was &s;pread along at full length in a complete &s;uit
of armour, with the trophies of war hung round about him; and the bi&s;hop was
laid flat upon his back, with his coifed head re&s;ting on a &s;tone bible, and
his hands joined together in the po&s;ture of praying.</P>
<P>IF <HI>Socrates,</HI> or any other of the ancient Philo&s;ophers
could revive again, and be admitted into <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Abby, he
would be induced to fancy him&s;elf in a <HI>Pantheon</HI> of the Heathen Gods.
The Modern Ta&s;te, (not content with introducing <HI>Roman</HI> temples into
our Churches, and repre|&s;enting the Virtues under allegorical images) has
ran&s;acked all the fabulous accounts of the Heathen Theology to &s;trike out
new embelli&s;hments for our <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> monuments. We are not in the
lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee <HI>Mercury</HI> attending <PB N="336" REF="17">
the tomb of an orator, and <HI>Pallas</HI> or <HI>Hercules</HI> &s;upporting
that of a warriour. <HI>Milton</HI> has been blamed for his frequent
allu&s;ions to the Heathen Theology in his Sacred Poem: but &s;urely we are
more to be condemned, for admitting the whole cla&s;s of their fictitious
deities into the Hou&s;e of God it&s;elf.</P>
<P>IF there is not a &s;top put to this Ta&s;te, we may &s;oon
expect to &s;ee our churches, in&s;tead of being dedicated to the &s;ervice of
religion, &s;et apart for the reception of the Heathen Gods. A decea&s;ed
admiral will be repre&s;ented like <HI>Neptune,</HI> with a trident in his
hand, drawn in a &s;hell by dolphins, preceded by <HI>Tritons,</HI> and
followed by <HI>Nereids</HI> la&s;hing the marble waves with their tails. A
general will be habited like <HI>Mars,</HI> bearing an helmet and &s;pear in
poli&s;hed &s;tone; and a celebrated toa&s;t will be &s;tuck up naked, like the
<HI>Ve|nus de Medicis,</HI> cut in alaba&s;ter.</P>
<P>IT has been propo&s;ed (on a different account) to have a
&s;eparate place di&s;tinct from our churches, for the reception of our
monuments. I could wi&s;h to &s;ee &s;uch a &s;cheme put in execution: for the
pre&s;ent ab&s;urd mixture of the &s;everal objects of <HI>Pagan</HI> and
<HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> belief, as repre&s;ented on the tombs lately &s;et up in
compliance of the modern ta&s;te, mu&s;t be &s;hocking to every &s;erious
beholder. Our pious fore|fathers were content with exhibiting to us the u&s;ual
em|blems of death, the hour-gla&s;s, the &s;kull, and the cro&s;s-marrow-bones:
but the&s;e are not &s;ufficient for our pre&s;ent more refined age: The Three
Fatal Si&s;ters, mentioned in the Heathen Mythology, mu&s;t be introduced
&s;pinning, draw|ing, and cutting the thread of life. Could one of the la&s;t
century &s;ee a winged figure blowing a trumpet on the top <PB N="337" REF="18"> of a modern monument, he would be apt to mi&s;take it for an
arch-angel, and be naturally put in mind of that awful time, 
<Q REND="inline">"when the trumpet &s;hall &s;ound, and the dead
&s;hall ri&s;e."</Q> But the de&s;ign, we are told, is very different; and this
winged me&s;&s;enger is no other than the ancient per&s;onage of Fame, who is
proclaiming the virtues of the defunct round the world.</P>
<P>SHOULD any one propo&s;e to take down from St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s
Ca|thedral tho&s;e paintings of Sir <HI>James Thornhill</HI> repre&s;enting the
tran&s;actions of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and in their place to &s;et up
<HI>Titian</HI>'s pictures of the amours of the Heathen Gods and Godde&s;&s;es,
every one would be &s;hocked at the impiety of the propo&s;al. Nor is the
fa&s;hion of introducing Heathen Deities into our monuments much le&s;s
ab&s;urd: for while any of tho&s;e are &s;uffered to remain in our Churches,
the reproof of our Sa|viour concerning the Temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> may
perhaps be|come applicable to the pre&s;ent times&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"My Hou&s;e is an Hou&s;e of Prayer; but ye have
made it a DEN OF THIEVES."</Q></P>
<P>I HOPE I &s;hall not be thought too grave or whim&s;ical, if I
earne&s;tly recommend it to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e whom it may concern,
whether a reformation is not nece&s;&s;ary in our Churches, to purge them from
the&s;e prophane images; which, though not the objects of our idolatry, have no
more pretence to be &s;et up in the Temple of the Living Lord, than tho&s;e of
the canonized Saints of the <HI>Roman Catholics.</HI></P>
<P>MODERN Ta&s;te is continually &s;triking out new improve|ments.
We may therefore conclude, that when our &s;tatu|aries <PB N="338" REF="19">
have travelled through the ancient <HI>Pantheon,</HI> and ex|hau&s;ted all the
&s;ubjects of the <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Mytho|logy, we &s;hall
have recour&s;e to the &s;uper&s;titions of other nations for the de&s;igns of
our monuments. They will then probably be adorned with <HI>Aegyptian</HI>
Hieroglyphics, and the tomb of &s;ome future hero may be built according to the
model of the Prophet's tomb at <HI>Mecca.</HI> It is not to be doubted, but
that the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Ta&s;te, which has been already introduced into our
gardens, our buildings, and our furni|ture, will al&s;o &s;oon find its way
into our Churches; and how elegant mu&s;t a monument appear, which is erected
in the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Ta&s;te, and embelli&s;hed with dragons, bells,
Pagods, and Mandarins!</P>

<P>_THERE is no method of reproof more in vogue, than the drawing
invidious parallels between the pre&s;ent times and the pa&s;t. The grumbling
politician rails over his coffee at the pre&s;ent mini&s;try, and reminds you
with a &s;igh of the golden Days of Queen <HI>Be&s;s:</HI> while, in mat|ters
of le&s;s con&s;equence, the critic &s;hakes his head at Mr. TOWN, and mentions
BICKERSTAFF. But the mo|rali&s;ts are above all others devoted to this
practice. The&s;e wi&s;e gentlemen are continually looking backwards, and
con|demning what lays immediately before them by retro&s;pect. They are for
ever harping on this jarring chord, and have <PB N="440" REF="21"> &s;carce
more words in their mouths than the &s;olemn &s;entences &s;aid to be delivered
by Fryar <HI>Bacon's</HI> Brazen Head, <HI>Time is&mdash;Time was&mdash;Time is
pa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>NO compari&s;ons of this &s;ort are &s;o frequently repeated,
and &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on, as tho&s;e drawn between the An|cients and
Moderns. If an eloquent member of the Hou&s;e of Commons is cruelly
&s;u&s;pected of bellowing for a place, no|thing rings in his ears but
<HI>Tully</HI> and <HI>Demo&s;thenes.</HI> If a gen|tleman or perhaps a
nobleman, with a heavy mortgage on his e&s;tate, di&s;encumbers it by &s;elling
his intere&s;t at a county election, he is immediately upbraided with one
<HI>Roman</HI> that was not a&s;hamed to follow the plough-tail, and another
who could refu&s;e large bribes, and content him&s;elf with a cottage and
turnips. If a lady makes an unfortunate &s;lip, &s;he is told again and again
of <HI>Lucretia,</HI> and fifty other &s;chool-boy tales of honour and
cha&s;tity. In a word, there is not one fa&s;hiona|ble frailty but has &s;ome
&s;tubborn antiquated virtue &s;et in oppo|&s;ition to it; and our unhappy
metropolis is every day threaten|ed with de&s;truction for its degeneracy from
the rigid maxims of <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Sparta.</HI></P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of all the&s;e &s;evere reflections, it gives me
infinite plea&s;ure, that I can with ju&s;tice take notice of the
inconte&s;table &s;uperiority of the Moderns in point of Mode&s;ty. The
arrogance of the Ancients was &s;o remarkable, that, in their idea of a perfect
character, they included every public and private virtue. They aimed at a
&s;trict ob&s;ervance of all the duties of life: and if &s;ome old
<HI>Romans</HI> had been &s;tiled Gods while living, it would not have been
&s;uch gro&s;s flattery as was afterwards practi&s;ed, in honouring the
Emperors with an <HI>Apotheo&s;is.</HI> Their inflexible hone&s;ty was their
perpetual <PB N="441" REF="22"> boa&s;t, and their virtue was their pride. This
high idea of a Perfect Character among the Ancients naturally urged them to
lift them&s;elves to an invidious &s;uperiority above the re&s;t of the world:
while the mode&s;t Moderns, by taking all the vices in&s;tead of the virtues
into their notion of a Fine Gentle|man, endeavour to let them&s;elves down to a
level with the lowe&s;t of their &s;pecies, and have laid the &s;ure&s;t
foundation for humility. Fine Gentlemen are &s;o far from being proud, that
they are never guilty of any thing which gives them the lea&s;t rea&s;on to be
&s;o: and our Fine Ladies have none of the di&s;gu&s;ting haughtine&s;s of
virtue, though indeed they are &s;el|dom known to be a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to devi&s;e one method of lowering the good
opinion a man might po&s;&s;ibly conceive of him&s;elf, that has not been put
in practice. No Fine Gentleman ever aimed at acquiring any excellence, and if
any natural perfections might give &s;ome little occa&s;ion for pride, the
greate&s;t pains have been taken to de&s;troy them. Good parts have been often
drowned in drunkenne&s;s, and a &s;trong con&s;titution &s;weated away in
bagnios: and in the mean time learning has been totally neglected, le&s;t
improvement &s;hould bring on pedantry and literary pride. The mo&s;t &s;hining
parts in the character of a Fine Gentleman are, that he drinks deep,
dre&s;&s;es gen|teelly, rides well, can &s;hoe his own hor&s;e, and is
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome few other qualifications, which nobody can ever
&s;u&s;|pect a mind the lea&s;t given to ambition would ever labour to acquire.
For my part I am &s;o far from agreeing with our famous &s;atiri&s;t that love
of fame is the univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ion, that when I ob&s;erve the behaviour of
our Fine Gentlemen, I am apt to think it proceeds from the lowe&s;t and
humble&s;t turn of mind: indeed their &s;ingular mode&s;ty appears to me the 
<PB N="442" REF="23"> only means of accounting for their actions, which
commonly tend to place them in the meane&s;t and mo&s;t contemp|tible
light.</P>
<P>NOTHING but this invincible Mode&s;ty, and fear of &s;eeming to
aim at excellence, could ever give ri&s;e to certain habits, not only
ridiculous, but ungraceful. Good eyes, for in&s;tance, are univer&s;ally
acknowledged to give lu&s;tre to the whole coun|tenance, yet fa&s;hion and
humility have blinded the whole town. The beau draws his eyes out of his
pocket, and the beauties kill us through &s;pying-gla&s;&s;es. It has been
known to be the vogue for per&s;ons of fa&s;hion to lo&s;e the u&s;e of their
legs, and limp along as if they were crippled: this practice I daily expect to
be revived, for I take it for granted that the tall &s;taves now carried about
mu&s;t naturally dwindle into crutches. An inarticulate li&s;p even now infects
the delivery in polite conver&s;ation. It is not at all unfa&s;hionable to
pre|tend deafne&s;s; and unle&s;s the ladies object to it, I do not de&s;pair
of &s;eeing the time when the whole modi&s;h world &s;hall affect to be
dumb.</P>
<P>THIS humble way of thinking has been carried &s;o far, that it
has even introduced a new &s;pecies of hypocri&s;y. Fine Gen|tlemen, fearing
le&s;t their good qualities &s;hould in their own de&s;pite overbalance their
bad ones, claim &s;everal vices to which they have no title. There is
&s;omething very admirable and ingenuous in this di&s;po&s;ition among our
young people, who not only candidly di&s;cover all their frailties, but
accu&s;e them|&s;elves of faults, which they never intended to commit. I know a
young fellow who is almo&s;t every morning complain|ing of the head-ache, and
cur&s;ing the la&s;t night's champagne at the St. <HI>Alban</HI>'s, when I am
well a&s;&s;ured he pa&s;&s;ed his evening <PB N="441" REF="24"> very &s;oberly
with his maiden aunts in <HI>Cheap&s;ide.</HI> I am al&s;o acquainted with
another gentleman, who is very fond of con|fe&s;&s;ing his intrigues, and often
mode&s;tly takes &s;hame to him|&s;elf for the great mi&s;chief he does among
the women; though I well know he is too ba&s;hful even to make love to his
laun|dre&s;s. He &s;ometimes laments publickly the unlucky conse|quences of an
amour, and has more than once been di&s;cover|ed to &s;end pill-boxes and
gallipots directed for him&s;elf, to be left at the bar of neighbouring
coffee-hou&s;es. The &s;ame humble turn of mind induces the frugal to appear
extravagant: and makes many a religious young fellow deny his principles, brave
his con&s;cience, and affect the character and conver&s;ation of an Athei&s;t.
To &s;ay the truth, the generality of the gay world are arrant hypocrites in
their vices, and appear to be wor&s;e than they really are. Many of our
pretended Bloods are, in fact, no more drunkards, whorema&s;ters, or infidels,
than a bully is a man of courage: and are as &s;incere in their boa&s;ts of
vice, as &s;tate&s;men or beauties in their mutual pro|fe&s;&s;ions of
friendship.</P>
<P>THAT part of the female world, which compo&s;es the order of
Fine Ladies, have as much humility as their counterparts, the Fine Gentlemen.
There is &s;omething &s;o charming in the fair &s;ex that we &s;hould almo&s;t
adore them, if they did not lay a&s;ide all the pride of reputation, and by
&s;ome good-natured familiarities reduce them&s;elves to an equality with us.
It is indeed wonderful to &s;ee with what diligence our polite ladies pare off
the excellencies from their characters. When we &s;ee them almo&s;t as naked as
the <HI>Graces,</HI> it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e them as warmly devoted to
<HI>Venus</HI>; and when we hear them talk loo&s;ely, and encourage double
meanings in conver&s;ation, we are apt to imagine their notions of honour not
very &s;trict <PB N="444" REF="25"> or &s;evere. But after all this is
frequently mere hypocri&s;y, and the effect of humility. Many a lady very
wanton in appear|ance, is in reality very mode&s;t; and many a coquet has
lo&s;t her reputation, without lo&s;ing her virtue. I make no doubt but that
&s;everal ladies of &s;u&s;picious characters are not &s;o bad as they &s;eem,
and that there are honourable per&s;ons among the gaye&s;t of our women of
quality.</P>
<P>TO return whence I &s;ee &s;et out, the extraordinary Mode&s;ty
of the Moderns, &s;o aver&s;e to the arrogant pride of the Ancients claiming
all virtues and good qualities what&s;oever, is the only key to their
behaviour. Thus vice, or at lea&s;t the appear|ance of vice, becomes
ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to pa&s;s through the world with tolerable decency,
and the character of a man of &s;pirit. As Sir <HI>John Brute</HI> &s;ays, 
<Q REND="inline">"they were &s;neaking dogs, and afraid of being
damned in tho&s;e days,"</Q> but we are better informed, and fear nothing but
the appearance of too much virtue. To &s;ecure the nobility, gentry, and others
from &s;o &s;hocking an imputation, I &s;hall &s;peedily pre&s;ent the world
with a curious piece, compiled from the practice and principles of the
pre&s;ent times, entitled <HI>A New Treati&s;e on Ethicks; or, a Sy&s;tem of
Immoral Philo&s;ophy.</HI> In this treati&s;e I have treated at large of Modern
Mode&s;ty, &s;hewn the excel|lence and utility of Immorality, and con&s;idered
Drinking, Whoring, Fighting, and Gaming, as the four Cardinal Vices, or in
other words, the principal con&s;tituents of Bucks, Bloods and Fine
Gentlemen.</P>

<P>_GOOD-NATURE is to the mind, what beauty is to the body; and an
agreeable di&s;|po&s;ition creates a love and e&s;teem for us in the re&s;t of
mankind, as an hand&s;ome per&s;on recommends us to the good graces of the
fair-&s;ex. To &s;ay the truth, any little defect in point of figure is
&s;ooner overlooked than a &s;ourne&s;s in the temper; and we conceive a more
la&s;ting di&s;gu&s;t at a moro&s;e chur|li&s;hne&s;s of manners than at a
hump-back or a pair of bandy legs. Good-Nature is, indeed, &s;o amiable a
qualification, that every man would be thought to po&s;&s;e&s;s it: and the
ladies them&s;elves would no more like to be accu&s;ed of a perver&s;e turn of
mind than of an unhappy ca&s;t of features. Hence it proceeds, that tho&s;e
unfortunate &s;tale virgins, u&s;ually call'd Old Maids, have both the&s;e
heavy cen&s;ures <PB N="446" REF="27"> thrown upon them; and are at once
condemned, as ugly and ill-natured.</P>
<P>SOME per&s;ons are (according to the &s;trict import of the
phra&s;e it&s;elf) born Good-Natured. The&s;e fortunate people are ea&s;y in
them&s;elves, and agreeable to all about them. They are, as it were,
con&s;titutionally plea&s;ing, and can no more fail of being affable and
engaging in conver&s;ation, than a <HI>Hamilton</HI> or a <HI>Coventry</HI> can
be otherwi&s;e than beautiful and charming. Yet it is the duty even of the&s;e,
who are naturally endowed 
<Q REND="inline">"with the &s;oft parts of conver&s;ation."</Q>
to be careful not to deprave or abu&s;e them. They mu&s;t not rely too
confidently on their native agreeablene&s;s of temper: for we &s;hould no more
e&s;teem a man, who di&s;covered a negligence of plea&s;ing, than we &s;hould
admire a beauty, who was an intolerable &s;lattern. Nor on the other hand,
&s;hould they let their Good-Nature run to an exce&s;s of com|pliment and
extravagant civility: for an engaging temper has been as often &s;poiled by
this trouble&s;ome politene&s;s, as a fine &s;hape has been &s;queezed into
frightful di&s;tortions by bad &s;tays, and a fine complexion entirely ruined
by paint.</P>
<P>BUT if this care is requi&s;ite even in tho&s;e few, who are
ble&s;t with this native complacency and good humour, how nece&s;&s;ary is it
for the generality of mankind to labour at rectifying the irregularities in
their temper. For this pur|po&s;e it would be fully &s;ufficient, if they would
employ half the art to cultivate their minds, that is daily made u&s;e of to
&s;et off their per&s;ons. To this important end not only the female delicacies
of paint and e&s;&s;ence are called in as auxi|liaries to the embroidered
&s;uits and <HI>French</HI> perukes, but this anxiety to &s;upply any
per&s;onal defect has &s;et the invention of <PB N="447" REF="28"> artificers
to work with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s, that there is &s;carce any external
blemi&s;h, which may not be removed or con|cealed: and however unkindly nature
may have dealt with you, you may by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance be made a model for
a &s;tatuary, or a pattern for a painter to &s;tudy. If you want an inch in
height, your &s;hoemaker can &s;upply it, and your ho&s;ier can furni&s;h you
with a pair of calves that may put an <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI> to the blu&s;h. An
irregularity in your &s;hape can be made invi&s;ible by your taylor, or at
lea&s;t by the arti&s;t near the <HI>Hay-market,</HI> who daily gives notice,
that he makes &s;teel &s;tays for all tho&s;e who are INCLINED <HI>to be
crooked.</HI> There are various compounds and co&s;metics that will cure
&s;pots and freckles in the complexion, and combs and oint|ments that will
change red hair to the fine&s;t brown. Do you want an eye? <HI>Taylor</HI> will
fill the vacant &s;ocket with as bright a piercer as the family of the
<HI>Pentweazles</HI> can boa&s;t: or is your mouth <HI>deficient</HI> for want
of teeth, <HI>Paul Jullion</HI> (to u&s;e his own phra&s;e) will <HI>rectify
your head,</HI> and fix a &s;et in your gums as even and beautiful as ever
adorned the mouth of a chimney-&s;weeper. The&s;e and many other inven|tions as
curious and extraordinary have been devi&s;ed; and there are no operations,
however painful, which have not been &s;ubmitted to with patience to conquer
per&s;onal defor|mities. I know a gentleman who went through the agony of
having his leg broke a &s;econd time, becau&s;e it had been &s;et awry; and I
remember a lady, who died of a cancer in her brea&s;t, occa&s;ioned by the
application of repelling plai&s;ters to keep back her milk, that the beauty of
her neck might not be de&s;troyed. I mo&s;t heartily wi&s;h the &s;ame
resolution was di&s;covered in improving the di&s;po&s;ition. Half the care
that is taken of the body would have happy effects upon the 
<PB N="448" REF="29"> temper. <HI>Tully</HI> in that part of his
<HI>Offices,</HI> where he &s;peaks of Grace, tells us, 
<Q REND="inline">"that it is de&s;troyed by any violent
per|turbations either of the body or mind."</Q> It is a pity that mankind
cannot be reconciled to this opinion; &s;ince it is likely, they would &s;pare
no pains in cultivating their minds if it tended to adorn their per&s;ons. Yet
it is certain that a man makes a wor&s;e figure with an ignorant pate than an
un|powdered peruke, and that knowledge is a greater ornament to the head than a
bag or a &s;mart cocked hat; that anger &s;ets like a blood-&s;hot in the eyes,
while good-nature lights them up with &s;miles, and makes every feature in the
face charming and agreeable. There is a certain &s;weetne&s;s of
di&s;|po&s;ition, which is &s;ure to procure to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it
the good-will of their acquaintance; but it is as ridiculous for a man to hope
to be beloved, while he neglects to be amiable, as it would be in a lady, who
expects a multitude of admi|rers, to appear always in a dirty di&s;habille.</P>
<P>THE difficulty of being convinced that we want this &s;ocial
turn, is the grand rea&s;on that &s;o little pains are taken to acquire and
perfect it. Would a man once be per&s;uaded of any irregularity in his temper,
he would find the blemi&s;hes of the mind more ea&s;ily corrected and amended
than the de|fects and deformities of the body; but alas! every man is in his
own opinion &s;en&s;ible and good-humour'd. It is, indeed, po&s;&s;ible to
convince us, that we have a bad complexion or an aukward deportment, which we
endeavour to amend by wa&s;hes and a dancing-ma&s;ter; but when the mind is in
fault, &s;elf-adulation, the mo&s;t fatal &s;pecies of flattery, makes us
cajole our&s;elves into a belief, that the fault is not in our own
di&s;po&s;ition, but in that of our companions: as the mad <PB N="449" REF="30"> inhabitants of <HI>Moor-fields</HI> conclude all, that come to
vi&s;it them, out of their &s;en&s;es. A whim&s;ical per&s;on complains of the
perver&s;ene&s;s of his acquaintance, and con&s;tantly ac|cu&s;es them of fancy
and caprice: and there never was an in&s;tance of a po&s;itive untoward man,
that did not continu|ally rail at the &s;tubbornne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy of the
re&s;t of the world. A modern Buck damns you for a &s;ullen fellow, if you
refu&s;e a pint bumper, and looks upon you as a &s;neaking &s;coundrel if you
decline entering into any of his wild pranks, and do not chu&s;e to lay all
night in the round-hou&s;e. It was the &s;aying of an old philo&s;opher, that 
<Q REND="inline">"the eye &s;ees not it&s;elf:"</Q> but when this
blind partiality is carried &s;o far, as to make us think tho&s;e guilty of the
folly who make us &s;en&s;ible of it, it is &s;urely as ab&s;urd as to imagine,
that the hair-lip or carbuncled no&s;e, a man &s;ees in the gla&s;s, belongs to
the figure in the mirror, and not to his own face. This fooli&s;h flattery it
is, that makes us think our&s;elves inflexibly right, while we are
ob&s;tinately wrong, and prevents our receiving or communicating, any
plea&s;ure in &s;ociety. The untractable humouri&s;t, while he di&s;gu&s;ts all
that are about him, conceives him&s;elf to be the per&s;on affronted, and
la|ments that there is no harmony in the conver&s;ation, though he is him&s;elf
the only one out of tune.</P>
<P>PERFECTION is no more to be expected in the minds of men than in
their per&s;ons: Natural defects and irregularities in both mu&s;t be
overlooked and excu&s;ed. All I de&s;ire at pre&s;ent is, that they would
endeavour with equal earne&s;tne&s;s to cultivate their minds, as they do to
adorn their per&s;ons. To this end we &s;hould examine our&s;elves impartially,
and not erect our&s;elves into judges, and treat all the re&s;t; of man|kind
like criminals. Would it not be mighty ridiculous in <PB N="450" REF="31"> a
per&s;on of quality to go to court in a ruff, a cloak, a pair of trunk
breeches, and the habit worn in the days of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and while
he &s;trutted about in this antiquated garb, to accu&s;e all the re&s;t of the
world of being out of the fa&s;hion? As we are compo&s;ed of a body and mind,
equal attention &s;hould be paid to both; and we &s;hould not be anxious to
cloath the per&s;on, and at the &s;ame time let the mind go naked. We &s;hould
be equally a&s;&s;iduous to obtain knowledge and virtue as to put on lace and
velvet: and when our minds are completely dre&s;&s;ed, we &s;hould take care
that good-nature and complacency influence and direct the whole; which will
throw the &s;ame grace over our virtues and good qualities, as fine cloaths
receive from being cut according to the fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>I CANNOT conclude better than with a pa&s;&s;age from
<HI>Swift</HI>'s <HI>Tale of a Tub,</HI> where the &s;trict analogy between the
cloathing of the mind and the body is humourou&s;ly pointed out. 
<Q REND="inline">"Man (&s;ays he) is a <HI>Micro-coat.</HI> As to
his body there can be no doubt; but examine even the acquirements of his mind,
you will find them all contribute in their order towards furni&s;hing out an
exact dre&s;s. To in&s;tance no more; is not <HI>religion</HI> a cloak,
<HI>hone&s;ty</HI> a pair of &s;hoes worn out in the dirt, <HI>&s;elf-love</HI>
a &s;urtout, <HI>vanity</HI> a &s;hirt, and <HI>con&s;cience</HI> a pair of
breeches, which though a cover for lewdne&s;s as well as na&s;tine&s;s, is
ea&s;ily &s;lipt down for the &s;ervice of both."</Q></P>

<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WAR, though it has not laid our fields wa&s;te or made our
cities de&s;olate, engro&s;&s;es almo&s;t all the at|tention of this place.
Every farm-hou&s;e &s;warms with poli|ticians, who lay their wi&s;e heads
together for the good of the nation, and at every petty chandler's &s;hop in
town, while the half quarterns of tea are weighed out, the balance of
<HI>Europe</HI> is adju&s;ted. The preparations now making by &s;ea and land
are as popular &s;ubjects as the price of hay or the Broad-Wheel-Act. Succe&s;s
to our noble admirals, and a &s;peedy war, are al&s;o as common toa&s;ts over a
mug of ale as a good harve&s;t: though it mu&s;t be owned, that &s;ome
&s;el|fi&s;h farmers, who have not an equal &s;hare of public &s;pirit and love
of their country with their fellow ru&s;tics, are &s;omewhat apprehen&s;ive of
the influence, which a war may have upon the Land-tax.</P>
<P>I AM at pre&s;ent on a vi&s;it to Sir <HI>Politic Hearty,</HI>
who is one of tho&s;e country gentlemen, that are continually athir&s;t for
news, and are more anxious about the affairs of the nation, than the care of
their own e&s;tates. Sir <HI>Politic</HI> is mi&s;erable three days in the week
for want of fre&s;h in|telligence; but his &s;pirits revive at the &s;ound of
the po&s;t|horn, <PB N="454" REF="35"> when the mail brings him the <HI>Lomdon
Evening Po&s;t,</HI> and a long letter of news from his nephew at the
<HI>Temple.</HI> The&s;e Sir <HI>Politic</HI> him&s;elf reads after dinner to
me, the cu|rate of the pari&s;h, and the town-apothecary, whom he indulges with
the run of his table for their deep in&s;ight into the proceedings of the
government. He makes many &s;hrewd remarks on every paragraph, and frequently
takes the opinion of the two Doctors (for he honours both the curate and
apothecary with that title) on the a&s;teri&s;ks, da&s;hes, and italics. He has
al&s;o di&s;covered &s;everal my&s;teries in his Maje&s;ty's vi&s;it to
<HI>Hanover,</HI> has elected a king of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and laid a better
plan for di&s;charging the national debt, than has ever yet been propo&s;ed by
<HI>Jacob Henriques.</HI> Many of his reflections have given me great
entertainment but I was never more diverted than at the following droll
incident at one of our late privy councils. Sir <HI>Politic</HI>'s nephew, who,
it &s;eems, has made as great a proficiency in the &s;tudy of the Humbug as of
the law, &s;ent him down, as a &s;erious prophecy, a new pamphlet humourou&s;ly
foretelling the de&s;|truction of the <HI>French</HI> from <HI>Ezekiel.</HI>
This the un&s;u&s;picious Baronet read very gravely over, and then turning to
the cu|rate, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Rare news, doctor!&mdash;Come fill a bumper
to <HI>Old England</HI>&mdash;We have the bible of our &s;ide, you &s;ee, and
hark ye, Doctor, I'd advi&s;e you as a friend to preach a &s;ermon upon
<HI>Thou &s;halt be de&s;olate,</HI> O MOUNT SEIR!"</Q></P>
<P>NOTHING at fir&s;t puzzled the hone&s;t baronet, and the
re&s;t of our country politicians &s;o much as the new &s;eat of war. They were
pretty tollerably acquainted with <HI>Bru&s;&s;els, Ghent, Antwerp,</HI> and
the other &s;cenes of action in <HI>Flanders,</HI> but <HI>Virginia,</HI> the
<HI>Ohio,</HI> the Lake <HI>Ontario,</HI> &amp;c. (to u&s;e a common phra&s;e)
were quite out of their latitude. This <PB N="455" REF="36"> difficulty was
however at length &s;urmounted by the tem|plar's tran&s;mitting to his uncle
one of <HI>D' Anville</HI>'s maps, which has enabled the baronet &s;ometimes to
delineate the progre&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> up the <HI>Ohio</HI> in
meanders of port winding along the table, and &s;ometimes to demoli&s;h the
forts lately rai&s;ed by the enemy behind <HI>Pen&s;ylvania</HI> and at
<HI>Crown Point.</HI> Sir <HI>Politic</HI> has indeed &s;tudied Mon&s;ieur
<HI>D' Anville</HI> very thoroughly, and I dare &s;ay is better ac|quainted
with his plan of <HI>North America,</HI> than with the map of his own
e&s;tate.</P>
<P>WAR never fails of producing &s;everal groundle&s;s and
contradictory reports; but if Fame is a lying jade in town, &s;he is the
idle&s;t go&s;&s;ip that ever &s;poke in the country. It is impo&s;&s;ible for
you, Cou&s;in, or any of your readers, who re&s;ide con&s;tantly in
<HI>London,</HI> to form any tolerable idea of a country news-paper. There is
in this town a petty printer who &s;ets his pre&s;s to work once a week by
publi&s;hing a journal, which contains advices more extraordinary, if not
authentic, than the gazette. It has been his cu&s;tom for &s;ome years pa&s;t
to rai&s;e apparitions in country churches, to give accounts of battles fought
in the air, comets, and &s;everal other preternatural phoenomena: but &s;ince
the rumour of a war, he has dealt in nothing but &s;kirmi&s;hes and
engage|ments. He gave the <HI>French</HI> fleet &s;everal furious broad&s;ides
before it &s;ailed from <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> and has gained us &s;everal
vic|tories in <HI>Virginia</HI>; though in his la&s;t journal he &s;hot off
both <HI>Bo&s;cawen</HI>'s legs, and made him fight, like
<HI>Wither|ington,</HI> on his &s;tumps; and it was but ye&s;terday that Sir
<HI>Politic,</HI> on the authority of a letter from his nephew, confuted this
intelligence, and &s;et the Admiral on his legs again.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="37">THIS, Cou&s;in, is the pre&s;ent &s;tate
of politics at &mdash;, which I think, in the &s;tile of our news-papers, might
cau&s;e you much &s;peculation. You would be of great &s;ervice, if you could
per&s;uade our country &s;tate&s;men that they would be better employed at
their ru&s;tic occupations than in mana|ging the affairs of the nation, and
that many a man would make a &s;curvy figure at the helm of the &s;tate, who is
of great u&s;e at the plough-tail. As to my friend Sir <HI>Politic,</HI> I
&s;hould be very glad if he would leave the conduct of the war, and the
de&s;tination of our fleets and armies to the mi|ni&s;try, who will, I doubt
not, adju&s;t matters as prudently as him&s;elf, the curate, and apothecary:
and I think his thoughts might be more properly exerci&s;ed in contriving
&s;ome method of redeeming two heavy mortgages that in|cumber his e&s;tate,
than in laying plans for the di&s;charge of the national debt.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I READ your late paper, &s;hewing the clo&s;e analogy which
cloathing the body bears to adorning the mind, with great attention: and am
thoroughly per&s;uaded, that the generality of mankind would be as glad to
embelli&s;h their minds as to &s;et off their per&s;ons, if they could procure
knowledge, virtue, and good-nature, with the &s;ame ea&s;e that they can
furni&s;h them&s;elves with the ornaments of the body. The clown in rug or
duffel can, at a moment's warning, be furni&s;hed with a complete &s;uit of
lace or embroidery <PB N="458" REF="39"> from <HI>Monmouth-&s;treet</HI>: his
long lank grea&s;y hair may be exchanged in <HI>Middle Row</HI> for a &s;mart
bag or a jemmy &s;cratch; and his clouted &s;hoes, with the rough hobnails in
the heel and &s;ole clumping at every &s;tep, may be transformed into a pair of
dancing pumps at the <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Warehou&s;e, or the <HI>Old
Cri&s;pin</HI> in <HI>Cranbourn Alley.</HI> The draggled &s;treet walker can
rig her&s;elf with a clean &s;mock, a linen gown, and a hat &s;martly cocked up
behind and before, in <HI>Broad St. Giles</HI>'s; or if &s;he can afford it,
every pawn-broker will let out a gold watch with coronets, a ti&s;&s;ue or
brocaded &s;ack, and all the <HI>paraphernalia</HI> of a counte&s;s. But where,
Mr. TOWN, can the&s;e people go to cloath their minds, or at what &s;hops are
retailed &s;en&s;e and virtue? Honour and hone&s;ty are not to be purcha&s;ed
in <HI>Monmouth-&s;treet</HI>: Know|ledge is not infu&s;ed into the head
through the powder-puff; and, as good wine needs no bu&s;h, &s;en&s;e is not
derived from the full-bottomed periwig. The woman of the town, vamped up for
&s;how with paint, patches, plumpers, and every external ornament that art can
&s;ugge&s;t, knows no me|thod to beautify her mind. She cannot for any price
buy cha&s;tity in <HI>Broad St. Giles</HI>'s, or hire hone&s;ty from the
pawn|broker's.</P>
<P>SEEING therefore at one view the difficulty in obtaining the
accompli&s;hments of the mind, and the exact analogy they bear to dre&s;s, I
have been labouring this week pa&s;t to remedy that inconvenience, and have at
length devi&s;ed a &s;cheme which will fully an&s;wer that purpo&s;e. In a word
then, I &s;hall next winter open a &s;hop or warehou&s;e in the mo&s;t public
part of the town, under the name of a MIND-AND BODY-CLOTHIER: two trades which,
though never yet united, are &s;o far from being incompatible, that they are in
<PB N="459" REF="40"> their nature in&s;eparable. I &s;hall not only &s;upply
my friends with a &s;uit or a &s;ingle virtue, but furni&s;h them with
com|plete habits of mind and body from head to foot: and by a certain &s;ecret
art in the form and texture of the things &s;old, the required virtues &s;hall
be as inherent in them, as the materials of which they are compo&s;ed. That
&s;uch virtues may be transfu&s;ed by cloaths is evident from experience. In
the narrow extent of my reading, Mr. TOWN, I remem|ber to have met with an
account of <HI>Fortunatus</HI>'s <HI>Wi&s;hing-Cap,</HI> by which he could
tran&s;port him&s;elf in an in&s;tant from one place to another: It is al&s;o
well known, that the famous <HI>Jack</HI> the Giant-killer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a
&s;word of &s;harpne&s;s, &s;hoes of &s;wiftne&s;s, and a coat of
invi&s;ibility. Why then may not I &s;ell a &s;uit of patrioti&s;m, a &s;word
of honour, and retail mode&s;ty and cha&s;tity to fine ladies in tuckers and
aprons. My &s;cheme is already in great forwardne&s;s; and I &s;hall be able to
accommodate my cu&s;tomers by the next birth-day: wherefore, as Me&s;&s;ieurs
<HI>Paris</HI> and others daily adverti&s;e in the news-papers, I al&s;o
chu&s;e to give the world public notice of my &s;cheme, and &s;hall be proud to
&s;ee them fir&s;t appri&s;ed of it by means of your paper.</P>
<P>NO one, who duly con&s;iders the natural influence, which
cloaths commonly have upon their wearers, will object to my &s;cheme as utterly
impracticable. That a per&s;on can put on or throw off the internal habits of
his mind together with his coat or his perriwig, is plain in very numerous
in&s;tances. The young coun&s;ellor, who every morning in term time takes the
mea&s;ure of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall</HI> with the importance of a judge upon
the circuit, at once dive&s;ts him&s;elf of his gravity with the &s;tarched
band and long robe, and re&s;umes the &s;pirit of a buck together with the 
<PB N="460" REF="41"> &s;word and bag-wig. In the &s;ame manner the orthodox
vicar once a week wraps him&s;elf up in piety and virtue with his canonicals;
which qualities are as ea&s;ily ca&s;t off again as his &s;urplice; and for the
re&s;t of the week he wears the dre&s;s as well as the manners of his
fox-hunting patron. We may learn the di&s;po&s;ition of a man by his apparel,
as we know the trade of a carpenter by his leathern apron, or a &s;oldier by
his red coat. When we &s;ee a &s;nuff-coloured &s;uit of <HI>ditto</HI> with
the bolus buttons, a metal headed cane, and an enormous bu&s;hy grizzle, we as
readily know the wearer to be a di&s;pen&s;er of life and death, as if we had
&s;een him pounding a mortar or brandi&s;hing a cly&s;ter-pipe. The different
affections of the mind have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by different colours; as
&s;carlet has been made to repre&s;ent valour, yellow to denote jealou&s;y, and
true blue to &s;ignify integrity: but we may likewi&s;e di&s;cover all the
virtues and vices lurking in the different parts of the apparel. When at a city
fea&s;t I &s;ee the gue&s;ts tucking their napkins into their &s;hirt-collars,
as if they were all of them going to be &s;haved, I very well know that their
thoughts wear a different dre&s;s than in the Alley: and when the antiquated
toa&s;t is laying on her complexion at the toilette, and repairing the ruins of
beauty, what is &s;he doing but patching her mind with pride and conceit? In a
word, I can di&s;cover impudence &s;taring from the bold cock of a
<HI>Kevenhuller,</HI> frugality &s;kulk|ing in a darned &s;tocking, coquetry
&s;pread out in a hoop|petticoat, and &s;oppery dangling from a
&s;houlder-knot. I often plea&s;e my&s;elf with thus remarking the various
dre&s;&s;es of the mind; and by the clue you have already given us I have been
able to unfold the inmo&s;t linings of the heart, and di&s;cover 
<Q REND="inline">"the very &s;tuff of the thoughts."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="42">IT mu&s;t, however, be owned, that in
the&s;e matters the nice&s;t penetration may be impo&s;ed on; &s;ince in the
pre&s;ent random method of dre&s;&s;ing, many per&s;ons appear in
ma&s;|querade. This inconvenience, among many others, will be remedied by my
project; for, as whoever deals with me will at once cloath his mind and his
body, the whole town will be dre&s;&s;ed in character. Thus if a
chimney-&s;weeper or a plough-boy put on a &s;uit of embroidery, a &s;word,
bag-wig, &amp;c. they will at the &s;ame time inve&s;t them&s;elves with the
inter|nal dignity of a per&s;on of quality: my lady's younge&s;t &s;on may buy
courage with his regimentals, and orthodoxy may be purcha&s;ed at the &s;ame
time with a gown and ca&s;&s;ock by the young &s;marts from the univer&s;ities.
My &s;cheme al&s;o further recommends it&s;elf, by laying open the only path to
virtue and knowledge, that the world will chu&s;e to follow: and as my cloaths
will always be cut according to the newe&s;t and mo&s;t elegant manner, the&s;e
qualifications of the mind, inherent in them, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily come into
fa&s;hion. Thus our fine gentlemen will learn morality under their valet de
chambre; and a young lady of fa&s;hion will acquire new ac|compli&s;hments with
every new ribband, and become virtu|ous as well as beautiful at her toilette. I
depend on your readine&s;s to promote my &s;cheme; but what I mo&s;t
earne&s;tly intreat of you, Mr. TOWN, is to u&s;e your utmo&s;t intere&s;t with
the polite world, but e&s;pecially with the ladies, not to di&s;card cloaths
entirely; as by &s;uch a re&s;olution my &s;cheme mu&s;t be defeated: and
indeed it will not be in the power of man to give them virtue, if they
determine to go naked.</P>
<P>AS knowledge and virtue can never be &s;ufficiently
dif|fu&s;ed, my warehou&s;e will be calculated for general u&s;e, and &s;tored
with large a&s;&s;ortments of all kinds of virtues and dre&s;&s;es, that I may
&s;uit per&s;ons of whatever denomination. Phy&s;icians may be furni&s;hed from
my &s;hop with gravity and learning in the tyes of a perriwig; &s;erjeants at
law may be fitted with a competent knowledge of reports under a coif; 
<PB N="460" REF="43"> and young coun&s;ellors may be endued with a &s;ufficient
fund of eloquence for the circuits, in a &s;mart tye between a bob and a flow,
contrived to cover a toupee. I &s;hall &s;ell religion to country par&s;ons in
pudding-&s;leeves, and to young town curates ju&s;t come from the univer&s;ity,
in doctors &s;carfs and cut grizzles: I &s;hall have &s;ome pious ejaculations,
whi|nings, and groans, ready cut out in leathern aprons and blue frocks, for
the preaching fraternity of carpenters, brick|layers, tallow-chandlers, and
butchers, at the Tabernacle and Foundery in <HI>Moor-fields.</HI> For our
military gentlemen de|&s;igned to go abroad, I &s;hall have &s;everal parcels
of true <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> courage woven in a variety of cockades and
&s;word-knots: and for our fine gentlemen, who &s;tay at home, I have pro|vided
a proper quantity of <HI>French Bagatelle,</HI> in cut velvet, lace and
embroidery, neat as imported.</P>
<P>AS the ladies, I &s;uppo&s;e, will all of them to a woman be
de&s;irous of purcha&s;ing beauty with every branch of the fe|male apparel, I
am afraid I &s;hall not be able to an&s;wer their demands: but I &s;hall have
&s;everal dre&s;&s;es, which will make up for the want of it. I &s;hall have
neatne&s;s done up in a great variety of plain linnen; decency and di&s;cretion
in &s;everal patterns for mobs, hoods, and nightgowns; together with mode&s;ty
di&s;po&s;ed into tuckers, kerchiefs for the neck, &s;tays that almo&s;t meet
the chin, and petticoats that touch the ground. I &s;hall al&s;o have a &s;mall
portion of cha&s;tity knit into garters, and laces for the &s;tays, very proper
to be worn at ma&s;querades and a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>I HAD almo&s;t forgot to mention, that authors, who are often
in equal want of &s;en&s;e and cloaths, &s;hall be fitted out by me with both
at once on very rea&s;onable rates. As for your&s;elf, Mr. TOWN, I &s;hall beg
leave to pre&s;ent you with an entire &s;uit of &s;uperfine wit and humour,
warranted to wear well, and appear creditable, and in which no author would be
a&s;hamed to be &s;een.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_NOTHING appears to me to be more nece&s;|&s;ary in order to
wear off any particularities in our behaviour, or to root out any
per|ver&s;ene&s;s in our opinions, than mixing with per&s;ons of ages and
occupations different from our own. Who&s;oever confines him&s;elf entirely to
the &s;ociety of tho&s;e who are engaged in the &s;ame per&s;uits, 
<PB N="464" REF="45"> and who&s;e thoughts naturally take the &s;ame turn with
his own, acquires a certain &s;tiffne&s;s and pedantry of behaviour, which is
&s;ure; to make him di&s;agreeable, except in one particular &s;et of company.
In&s;tead of cramping the mind by keeping it within &s;o narrow a circle, we
&s;hould endeavour to enlarge it by every worthy notion and accompli&s;hment;
and temper each qualification with its oppo&s;ite, as the four elements are
compounded in our natural frame.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of this free conver&s;ation, to open and
im|prove the mind, is evident from the con&s;equences, which always follow a
neglect of it. The employment each man follows, wholly engro&s;&s;es his
attention, and tinges the mind with a peculiar die, which &s;hews it&s;elf in
all the operations of it, unle&s;s prevented by natural good &s;en&s;e and
liberal education. The phy&s;ician, the lawyer, and the trade&s;man will appear
in company, though none of tho&s;e occupations are the &s;ubject of
di&s;cour&s;e; and the clergyman will grow moro&s;e and &s;evere, who &s;eldom
or never conver&s;es with the laity. But if no particular profe&s;&s;ion has
this influence over us, &s;ome darling pa&s;&s;ion or amu&s;ement gives a
colour to our thoughts and actions, and makes us odious, or at lea&s;t
ridiculous. Fine ladies for in&s;tance, by de&s;pi&s;ing the con|ver&s;ation of
&s;en&s;ible men, can talk of nothing but routes, balls, a&s;&s;emblies,
birth-day &s;uits, and intrigues; and fine gentlemen, for the &s;ame rea&s;on,
of almo&s;t nothing at all. In like manner, the furious partizan, who has not
been weaned from a mad attachment to particular principles, is weak enough to
imagine every man of a different way of thinking a fool and a &s;coundrel; and
the &s;ectary or zealot devotes to eternal damnation all tho&s;e, who will not
go to heaven in the &s;ame road with him&s;elf, under the guidance 
<PB N="465" REF="46"> of <HI>Whitefield, We&s;ley,</HI> or <HI>Count
Zinzendorff.</HI> To the &s;ame cau&s;e we owe the rough country &s;quire,
who&s;e ideas are wholly bent on guns, dogs, hor&s;es, and game; and who has
every thing about him of a piece with his diver&s;ions. His hall mu&s;t be
adorned with &s;tags heads in&s;tead of bu&s;ts and &s;tatues, and in the room
of family pictures, you will &s;ee prints of the mo&s;t famous &s;tallions and
race-hor&s;es: all his doors open and &s;hut with foxes feet, and even the
buttons of his cloaths are impre&s;&s;ed with the figures of dogs, foxes,
&s;tags, and hor&s;es. To this ab&s;urd practice of culti|vating only one &s;et
of ideas, and &s;hutting our&s;elves out from any intercour&s;e with the re&s;t
of the world, is owing that narrowne&s;s of mind which has infected the
conver&s;ations of the polite world with in&s;ipidity, made roughne&s;s and
bruta|lity the characteri&s;tics of a mere country gentleman, and pro|duced the
mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences in politics and religion.</P>
<P>BUT if this commerce with the generality of mankind is &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary to remove any impre&s;&s;ions, which we may be liable to receive
from any particular employment or darling amu&s;ement, what precautions ought
to be u&s;ed, in order to remedy the inconveniences naturally brought on us by
the different ages of life! It is not certain that a per&s;on will be engaged
in any profe&s;&s;ion, or given up to any peculiar kind of plea&s;ure, but the
mind of every man is &s;ubject to the inclinations ari&s;ing from the &s;everal
&s;tages of his exi&s;tence, as well as his body to chronical di&s;tempers.
This indeed, Mr. TOWN, is the principal cau&s;e of my writing to you, for it
has often given me great concern to &s;ee the pre&s;ent divi&s;ion between the
young and the old; to ob&s;erve elderly men forming them&s;elves into clubs and
&s;ocieties, that they may be more &s;ecurely &s;eparated from youth; and to
&s;ee <PB N="466" REF="47"> young men running into di&s;&s;ipation and
debauchery, rather than a&s;&s;ociate with age. If each party would labour to
conform to the other, from &s;uch a coalition many advanta|ges would accrue to
both. Our youth would be in&s;tructed by the experience of age, and lo&s;e much
of that &s;everity, which they retain too long: while at the &s;ame time the
wrinkled brow of the aged would be &s;moothed by the &s;prightly chearfulne&s;s
of youth; by which they might &s;upply the want of &s;pirits, forget the lo&s;s
of old friends, and bear with ea&s;e all their worldly misfortunes. It is
re|markable, that tho&s;e young men are the mo&s;t worthy and &s;en&s;ible, who
have kept up any intercour&s;e with the old; and that tho&s;e old men are of
the mo&s;t chearful and amiable di&s;po&s;ition, who have not been a&s;hamed to
con|ver&s;e with the young.</P>
<P>I WILL not pretend to decide which party is mo&s;t blame|able
in neglecting this nece&s;&s;ary commerce between each other, which, if
properly managed, would be at once &s;o beneficial and delightful: but it
undoubtedly ari&s;es from a certain &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy in both,
which will not &s;uffer them to make a mutual allowance for the natural
difference of their di&s;po&s;itions. Their inclinations are indeed as
diffe|rent as their years; yet each expects the other to comply, though neither
will make any advances. How rarely do we &s;ee the lea&s;t degree of &s;ociety
pre&s;erved between a father and &s;on! a &s;hocking reflection, when we
con&s;ider that na|ture has endeavoured to unite them by parental affection on
one &s;ide, and filial gratitude on the other. Yet a father and &s;on as
&s;eldom live together with any tolerable harmony as a hu&s;band and wife; and
chiefly for the &s;ame rea&s;on: for though they are both joined under the
&s;ame yoke, yet they <PB N="467" REF="48"> are each tugging different ways. A
father might as well expect his &s;on to be as gouty and infirm as him&s;elf,
as to have the di&s;po&s;ition which he has contracted from age: and a &s;on
might as rea&s;onably de&s;ire the vigour and vivacity of five and twenty, as
his own love of gaiety and diver&s;ions in his father. It is therefore plainly
evident, that a mutual endeavour of conforming to each other is ab&s;olutely
requi|&s;ite to keep together the cement of natural affection, which the want
of it &s;o frequently di&s;&s;olves: or at at lea&s;t, if it does not di&s;turb
the affection, it con&s;tantly de&s;troys the &s;ociety between father and
&s;on.</P>
<P>THIS unhappy and unnatural divi&s;ion is often the &s;ubject
of complaint in per&s;ons of both ages, but is &s;till unremedied becau&s;e
they neither reflect on the cau&s;e whence it proceeds. Old men are perpetually
commenting on the extreme levity of the times, and blaming the young, becau&s;e
they do not admire and court their company: which indeed is no wonder, &s;ince
they generally treat their youthful companions as mere children, and expect
&s;uch a &s;lavi&s;h deference to their years, as de&s;toys that equality by
which chearfulne&s;s and &s;ociety &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. Young men do not like to be
chid by an ill-natur'd proverb, or reproved by a wrinkle: but though they do
not chu&s;e to be corrected by their grave &s;eniors, like &s;chool-boys, they
would be proud to con&s;ult them as friends; which the injudicious &s;everity
of old age &s;eldom will permit, not deigning to indulge them with &s;o great a
degree of freedom and familiarity. Youth, on the other hand, &s;hun the company
of age, complaining of the &s;mall regard and re&s;pect paid to them, though
they often act with &s;o little re&s;erve and &s;uch unbecoming confidence as
not to de&s;erve it. Suppo&s;e the old were plea&s;ed with the natu|ral 
<PB N="468" REF="49"> flow of &s;pirits and lively conver&s;ation of youth,
&s;till &s;ome re&s;pect may be challenged as due to them: nor &s;hould the
decency and &s;obriety of their characters ever be in&s;ulted by any improper
or immode&s;t conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I AM an old man my&s;elf, Mr. TOWN, and I have an only boy,
who&s;e behaviour to me is unexceptionable: per|mit me therefore to dwell a
moment longer on my favourite &s;ubject, and I will conclude. With what harmony
might all parents and children live together, if the father would &s;trive to
&s;often the rigour of age, and remember that his &s;on mu&s;t naturally
po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e qualities, which ever ac|company youth; and if the &s;on
would in return endeavour to &s;uit him&s;elf to tho&s;e infirmities which his
Father received from old age! If they would reciprocally &s;tudy to be
agree|able to each other, the father would in&s;en&s;ibly &s;ub&s;titute
affection in the room of authority, and lo&s;e the churli&s;h &s;everity and
peevi&s;hne&s;s incident to his years: while the &s;on would curb the
unbecoming impetuo&s;ity of his youth, change his reluctance to obey into a
con&s;tant attention to plea&s;e, and remit much of his extreme gaiety in
conformity to the gra|vity of his father. Wherever &s;uch a turn of mind is
en|couraged there mu&s;t be happine&s;s and agreeable &s;ociety; and the
contrary qualities of youth and age, thus com|pounded, compo&s;e the &s;ure&s;t
cement of affection, as colours of the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite tints by a &s;kilful
mixture, each giving and receiving certain &s;hades, will form a picture, the
mo&s;t heightened and exqui&s;ite in it's colouring.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I HAVE been very much diverted with your ob&s;ervations on
our hone&s;t trade&s;men, who make weekly excur&s;ions into the neigh|bouring
villages; and I agree with you, that the generality of our citizens &s;eldom
dare tru&s;t them&s;elves out of the &s;ight of <HI>London</HI> &s;moke, or
extend their travels further than with their wives and chil|dren in the
<HI>Wand&s;worth</HI> double po&s;t-chai&s;e, or the <HI>Hampton</HI> long
coach. But we may now and then pick up a &s;tray citizen, whom bu&s;ine&s;s has
dragged beyond the bills of <PB N="470" REF="51"> mortality, as it happened to
my&s;elf the other day about twenty miles from <HI>London:</HI> and as I was
mightily plea&s;ed with his behaviour and conver&s;ation, I have taken the
liberty to &s;end you an account of it.</P>
<P>BEING caught in a &s;hower upon the road, I was glad to take
&s;helter at the fir&s;t inn I came to; which, if it had been called the NEW
INN, I &s;hould have thought, from its antique appearance, that it had been an
hou&s;e of entertain|ment in the time of our great grandfathers. I had &s;carce
alighted, when a &s;trange figure (driven thither, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, on the
&s;ame account with my&s;elf,) came &s;oberly jogging into the yard, dripping
wet. As he waited for the &s;teps, before he would venture to get off his
hor&s;e, I had the opportu|nity of &s;urveying his whole appearance. He was
wrapped up in an old thread-bare weather-beaten &s;urtout, which I believe had
once been &s;carlet; the cape was pulled over his head, and buttoned up clo&s;e
round his face; and his hat was flapped down on each &s;ide, and fa&s;tened
about his ears with a li&s;t garter tyed under his chin. He wore upon his legs
&s;omething that re&s;embled &s;platterda&s;hes, which (as I afterwards
learned) were cut out of an old pair of boots; but his right &s;hoe was
con&s;iderably larger than the other, and had &s;everal &s;lits in the upper
leather. He had &s;purs on, indeed, but without rowels; and by way of whip a
worm-eaten cane, with a bone head &s;tudded with bra&s;s pins, hung from his
wri&s;t by a &s;tring of grea&s;y black leather.</P>
<P>I SOON found I was nobody: for the GENTLEMAN, it &s;eems, took
up the whole attention of the maid, mi&s;tre&s;s, and o&s;tler, who all of them
got round him, and with much difficulty, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
&s;teps, helped him down. <PB N="471" REF="52"> My landlady, (after the u&s;ual
welcome) before it was po&s;|&s;ible for her to &s;ee any part of him but his
no&s;e, told him 
<Q REND="inline">"he looked brave and jolly;"</Q> and when
&s;he had led him into the kitchen, &s;he fetched a large gla&s;s of what &s;he
called 
<Q REND="inline">"her own water,"</Q> which (&s;he &s;aid)
would keep the cold out of his &s;tomach. All hands were now bu&s;ied in
drawing off his &s;urtout, which di&s;covered underneath a full-trimmed white
coat, and a black velvet wai&s;tcoat with a broad gold lace very much
tarni&s;hed. The &s;urtout was hung to dry by the fire as well as his coat, the
place of which was &s;up|plied by a long riding-hood of my landlady; and as the
gentleman complained of having &s;uffered by a lo&s;s of leather, the maid was
di&s;patched to the doctor's for &s;ome <HI>diachylon.</HI> The u&s;ual
que&s;tion now &s;ucceeded, concern|ing dinner; and as he ob&s;erved I was all
alone, he very courteou&s;ly offered me to join company, which I as rea|dily
accepted.</P>
<P>THE important bu&s;ine&s;s of dinner being &s;ettled, we
ad|journed into a private room; when my fellow-gue&s;t told me of his own
accord, that he lived in <HI>London</HI>; that for the&s;e twenty years he had
always come to the town we were now in, once a year, to receive money, and take
orders for goods; and that he had always put up at this hou&s;e. He then run on
in the prai&s;es of the landlady; and tipping me a wink, 
<Q REND="inline">"ay, &s;ays he, &s;he has been a clever woman
in her time, before &s;he bore children."</Q> He added, that for his part he
did not like your great inns; for that they never looked upon any thing under a
coach and &s;ix. He fur|ther informed me, that he was married to his pre&s;ent
wife in the fir&s;t mayoralty of Alderman <HI>Par&s;ons,</HI> and in the very
wai&s;tcoat he had on: 
<Q REND="inline">"but, &s;ays he, I now wear it only 
<PB N="472" REF="53"> on a journey; becau&s;e, you know, a bit of lace
com|mands re&s;pect upon the road."</Q> Upon enquiring about his family, I
found he had three boys; one of whom was bound prentice to him&s;elf; the other
was &s;ent to &s;ea, be|cau&s;e he was a wild one; and the third he de&s;igned
to make a par&s;on of, becau&s;e he was grave, and his play-fellows at
<HI>Poule</HI>'s &s;chool u&s;ed to call him 
<Q REND="inline">"bi&s;hop."</Q></P>
<P>ALL this while he had &s;at in my landlady's riding-hood, with
a linen nightcap on his head tyed on the top with a piece of black ribband,
which (he told me) he always rode in, becau&s;e it was cooler than a wig. But
the &s;addle-bags were now ordered in; and out of one of them he drew a large
flowing grizzle carefully buckled, which he combed out him&s;elf, borrowing
&s;ome flour from the kitchen drudger. His &s;platterda&s;hes were next taken
off, his &s;hoes wiped with a wi&s;p of hay; and being a&s;&s;ured by the
landlady her&s;elf, that his coat was dry enough to put on, he completely
equipped him&s;elf, in order to wait on &s;everal trade&s;men, with whom he had
dealings, after dinner. As this was not quite ready, we took a walk to the
&s;tables to &s;ee his mare: and though the bea&s;t &s;eemed as lean and
harmle&s;s as <HI>Sancho</HI>'s a&s;s, he a&s;&s;ured me he had much ado to
ride her, &s;he was &s;o fri&s;ky; 
<Q REND="inline">"for &s;he had not run in the chai&s;e the&s;e
two &s;undays pa&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>BEING &s;ummoned in to dinner, we &s;at down to a repa&s;t of
mutton chops and &s;heeps hearts, which la&s;t he declared to be the
whol&s;ome&s;t eating in the world. He objected to wine, becau&s;e there was
not a drop good for any thing to be got upon the road; but he va&s;tly
recommended my landlady's home-brewed, which he affirmed to be better 
<PB N="473" REF="54"> than <HI>Hog&s;den</HI> ale, or the thatch beer at
<HI>I&s;lington.</HI> Our meal being ended, my companion took his pipe; and we
laid our heads together for the good of the nation, when we mauled the
<HI>French</HI> terribly both by land and &s;ea. At la&s;t, among other talk,
he happened to a&s;k me, if I lived in the City? As I was de&s;irous of hearing
his remarks, I an&s;wered, that I had never &s;een <HI>London.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Never &s;een it? (&s;ays he) Then you have
never &s;een one of the fine&s;t &s;ights in the whole world. <HI>Paris</HI> is
but a dog-hole to it."</Q> There luckily hung a large Map of <HI>London</HI>
over the chimney-piece, which he immediately made me get from my chair to look
at. 
<Q REND="inline">"There, &s;ays he, there's <HI>London</HI> for
you.&mdash;You &s;ee it is bigger than the Map of all <HI>England.</HI></Q> He
then led me about, with the end of his pipe, through all the principal
&s;treets from <HI>Hyde-Park</HI> to <HI>White-Chapel.</HI>&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"That, &s;ays he, is the River
<HI>Thames</HI>;&mdash;There's <HI>London</HI> Bridge&mdash;There my Lord Mayor
lives&mdash;That's <HI>Poule</HI>'s&mdash;There the <HI>Mo|nument</HI>
&s;tands: And now, if you was but on the top of it, you might &s;ee all the
hou&s;es and churches in <HI>London.</HI>"</Q> I expre&s;&s;ed my
a&s;toni&s;hment at every particular: but I could hardly refrain laughing, when
pointing out to me <HI>Lincoln's Inn Fields</HI>&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"There, &s;aid he, there all the noblemen
live."</Q> At la&s;t, after having tran&s;ported me all over the town, he &s;et
me down in <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"which (he &s;aid) was the big|ge&s;t &s;treet
in the City."&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"And now, &s;ays he, I'll &s;how you where I
live.&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"That's <HI>Bow-Church</HI>&mdash;and
there|abouts&mdash;where my pipe is&mdash;there&mdash;ju&s;t there my &s;hop
&s;tands."</Q> He concluded with a kind invitation to me to come and &s;ee him;
and pulling out a book of patterns from his coat-pocket, a&s;&s;ured me, that
if I wanted any thing in his way, he could afford to let me have a bargain.</P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="55">I PROMISED to call upon him; and the
weather now clearing up, after &s;ettling the ballance of our reckoning with

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IF polygamy was allowed in this country, I am &s;ure I might
maintain a &s;eraglio of wives at le&s;s expence than I have brought upon
my&s;elf by marrying one woman. One did I &s;ay? Alas! I find it to my co&s;t,
that a wife, like a polypus, has the power of dividing and multi|plying
her&s;elf into as many bodies as &s;he plea&s;es. You mu&s;t know, Mr. TOWN, I
took a woman of &s;mall fortune and made her my own fle&s;h and blood: but I
never thought that all her relations would likewi&s;e fa&s;ten on me with as
little ceremony as a colony of fleas. I had &s;carce brought 
<PB N="476" REF="57"> her home, before I was obliged to marry her mother: then
I was prevailed on to marry her two maiden &s;i&s;ters; after that I married
her aunts; then her cou&s;ins&mdash;In &s;hort, I am now married to the whole
generation of them. I do not exaggerate matters, when I &s;ay that I am married
to them all: for they claim as much right to every thing that is mine, as the
per&s;on whom the world calls my wife. They eat, drink, and &s;leep with me:
Every room in my hou&s;e is at their command, except my bedchamber: They
bor|row money of me:&mdash;and &s;ince I have the whole family quartered upon
me, what &s;ignifies which of them takes upon her my name,&mdash;my wife, her
&s;i&s;ter, or her twen|tieth cou&s;in?</P>
<P>O Mr. TOWN! I never &s;it down to table without the lamentable
pro&s;pect of &s;eeing as much victuals con&s;umed, as would dine a whole
ve&s;try. So many mouths con&s;tantly going at my expence! And then there is
&s;uch variety of provi|&s;ions! for cou&s;in <HI>Biddy</HI> likes one di&s;h;
my aunt <HI>Rachel</HI> is fond of another; &s;i&s;ter <HI>Molly</HI> cannot
abide this; and mother could never touch that:&mdash;though I find they are all
of them unanimous in liking the be&s;t of every thing in &s;ea&s;on. Be&s;ides,
I could entertain a &s;et of jolly topers at a le&s;s rate than it co&s;ts me
in light wines for the women. One of them drinks nothing but <HI>Li&s;bon</HI>;
with another nothing goes down but <HI>Rheni&s;h</HI> and <HI>Spa</HI>; a third
&s;wallows me an ocean of <HI>Bri&s;tol Milk,</HI> with as little remor&s;e as
&s;he would &s;o much &s;mall beer: my elde&s;t aunt likes a gla&s;s of dry
<HI>Mountain,</HI> while the other thinks nothing helps dige&s;tion &s;o well
as <HI>Madeira.</HI> 'Twas but the other day, that my wife expre&s;&s;ed a
de&s;ire of ta&s;ting &s;ome <HI>Claret,</HI> when im|mediately all my
good-natured relations had a mighty <PB N="477" REF="58"> longing for it: but
with much ado I at la&s;t prevailed on them to compound with me for a che&s;t
of <HI>Florence.</HI></P>
<P>YOU may imagine, that my hou&s;e cannot be a very &s;mall one:
and I a&s;&s;ure you there are as many beds in it, as in a country inn. Yet I
have &s;carce room to turn my&s;elf about in it; for one apartment is taken up
by this relation, another by that; and the mo&s;t di&s;tant cou&s;in mu&s;t
have more re&s;pect &s;hewn her than to be clapped up in a garret with the
maid-&s;ervants: &s;o that poor I have no more liberty in my own hou&s;e than a
lodger. Once, indeed, I in vain endeavoured to &s;hake them off, and took a
little box in the neighbourhood of town, &s;carce big enough to hold my own
family. But alas! they &s;tuck as clo&s;e to it, as a &s;nail to her &s;hell:
and rather than not lie under the &s;ame roof with their relation, they
contrived to litter together like &s;o many pigs in a &s;tye. At another time,
thinking to clear my hou&s;e at once of the&s;e vermin, I packed up my wife and
mother, and &s;ent them to her uncle's in the country for a month. But what
could I do? there was no getting rid of tho&s;e left behind: my wife had made
over to them the care of the hou&s;ehold, allotting to each of them her
particular employment during her ab&s;ence. One was to pickle walnuts, another
to pre&s;erve &s;weetmeats, another to make Morella brandy; all which they
executed with the notablene&s;s peculiar to good hou&s;ewives, who &s;poil and
wa&s;te more than they &s;ave, for the &s;atisfaction of making the&s;e things
at home. At la&s;t my wife returned; and all that I got by her journey, was the
importation of two new cou&s;ins fre&s;h out of the country, who &s;he never
knew before were the lea&s;t related to her:&mdash;but they have been &s;o kind
as to claim kindred with me by hanging upon me ever &s;ince.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="59">ONE would imagine, that it were
&s;ufficient for the&s;e loving relations to have the run of my table, and to
make my hou&s;e in every re&s;pect their own: but not content with this, they
have the cunning to oblige me in a manner to find them in cloaths likewi&s;e. I
&s;hould not repine, if any of my worthy relations were humble enough to put up
with a ca&s;t-off &s;uit of my wife's; but that would be robbing the maid of
her ju&s;t dues, and would look more like a dependant than a relation: Not but
that they will con|de&s;cend now and then to take a gown, before it is half
worn out, (when they have talked my wife into a di&s;like of
it)&mdash;becau&s;e it is too good for a common &s;ervant. They have more
&s;pirit than to <HI>beg</HI> any thing: but&mdash;if my wife has a fancy to
<HI>part</HI> with it&mdash;they will wear it, purely for her &s;ake. A cap, an
apron, or an handkerchief, which looks hideous upon her, I always find is very
becoming on any other of the family: and I remember, &s;oon after we were
married, happening to find fault with the pattern of a &s;ilk brocade my wife
had ju&s;t bought, one of her &s;i&s;ters took it from her, and told me &s;he
would have it made up for her&s;elf, and wear it on purpo&s;e to &s;pite
me.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t know, Mr. TOWN, that upon my marriage I was
indi&s;creet enough to &s;et up my chariot: and &s;ince my family has
increa&s;ed &s;o prodigiou&s;ly, this has given them a handle to have a coach
likewi&s;e, and another pair of hor&s;es, for them to take an airing in. This
al&s;o furni&s;hes them with a pretence for running about to public
diver&s;ions, where I am forced to treat them all: for they are &s;o very fond
of each others company, that one will hardly ever &s;tir out without the other.
Thus, at home or abroad, they con|&s;tantly herd together: and what is &s;till
more provoking, <PB N="479" REF="60"> though I had rather have a route every
week at my hou&s;e, my wife makes a merit of it, that &s;he keeps little or no
company.</P>
<P>SUCH is the &s;tate of my family within doors: and though you
would think this &s;ufficient for one man, I can a&s;&s;ure you that I have
other calls on me from relations no le&s;s dear to me, though I have never yet
had the happine&s;s to &s;ee them. A third cou&s;in by my wife's father's
&s;ide was &s;et up in the country in a very good way of bu&s;ine&s;s; but by
mi&s;|fortunes in trade mu&s;t have gone to jail, if my wife had not teized me
into being bound for him, and for which I was &s;oon after arre&s;ted, and
obliged to pay the money. Ano|ther, a very promi&s;ing youth, was ju&s;t out of
his time, and only wanted a little &s;um to &s;et him up; which as &s;oon as I
had lent him, he run away, and is gone to &s;ea. One of the aunts, who is now
with me, (a widow lady) has an only daughter, a &s;ober di&s;creet body, who
lived as a com|panion with an old gentlewoman in the country: but the poor
innocent girl being drawn a&s;ide by a vile fellow that ruined her, I have been
forced to &s;upport the unhappy mother and child ever &s;ince, to prevent any
reproach falling on our family. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the various
pre&s;ents, which have travelled down to my wife's uncle, in return for one
turkey and chine received at <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI>; nor &s;hall I put to account
the charge I have been at, in the go&s;&s;ips fees, and in buying corals,
&amp;c. for half a dozen little ne|phews, neices, and cou&s;ins, to which I had
the honour of &s;tanding godfather.</P>
<P>AND now, Mr. TOWN, the mention of this la&s;t circum|&s;tance
makes me reflect with an heavy heart on a new ca|lamity, <PB N="480" REF="61">
which will &s;hortly befal me. My wife, you mu&s;t know, is very near her time:
and they have provided as great a &s;tore of caps, clouts, biggens,
belly-bands, whittles, and all kinds of childbed-linnen, as would &s;et up a
Lying-in Ho&s;pital. You will conclude that my family wants no fur|ther
increa&s;e: Yet, would you believe it? I have ju&s;t re|ceived a letter, that
another aunt, and another cou&s;in, are coming up in the &s;tage coach to &s;ee
their relation, and are re&s;olved to &s;tay with her the month. Indeed I am
afraid, when they have once got footing in my hou&s;e, they will re&s;olve to
&s;tay with her till &s;he has another and another child.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_A MERE Country Squire, who pa&s;&s;es all his time among dogs
and hor&s;es, is now become an uncommon character; and the mo&s;t aukward
loobily inheritor of an old man&s;ion-hou&s;e is a fine gentleman in
compari&s;on to his forefathers. The principles of a town education for|merly
&s;carce &s;pread them&s;elves beyond the narrow limits of the bills of
mortality: but now every <HI>London</HI> refinement travels to the remote&s;t
corner of the kingdom, and the polite families from the town duly import to
their di&s;tant &s;eats the cu&s;toms and manners of <HI>Pall-mall</HI> and
<HI>Gro&s;venor-Square.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="482" REF="63">I HAVE been for this fortnight pa&s;t at
Lord <HI>Courtley</HI>'s, who for about four months in every year leads a town
life at the di&s;tance of above two hundred miles from <HI>London.</HI> He
never ri&s;es till twelve or one o'clock; though indeed he often &s;ees the
&s;un ri&s;e; but then that only happens, when, as the old &s;ong &s;ays, he
has 
<Q REND="inline">"drank down the moon."</Q> Drinking is the
only rural amu&s;ement he per&s;ues, but even that part of his diver&s;ions is
conducted entirely in the <HI>Lon|don</HI> fa&s;hion. He does not &s;will
country ale, but gets drunk with Champagne and Burgundy; and every di&s;h at
his table is &s;erved up with as much elegance as at <HI>White</HI>'s or
<HI>Ryan</HI>'s. He has an excellent pack of hounds: but, I believe, was never
in at the death of a fox in his life: yet &s;trangers never want a chace, for
the hounds are out three times a week with a younger brother of Lord
<HI>Courtley</HI>'s, who never &s;aw <HI>London</HI> in his life; and who, if
he was not indulged with a place at his lord&s;hip's table, might naturally be
con&s;idered as his whipper-in, or his game-keeper.</P>
<P>THE evening-walk is a thing unknown and unheard of at Lord
<HI>Courtley</HI>'s: for, though &s;ituated in a very fine country, he knows no
more of the charms of purling &s;treams and &s;hady groves, than if they never
exi&s;ted but in poetry or romance. As &s;oon as the daily debauch after
dinner, and the ceremonies of coffee and tea are over, the company is conducted
into a magnificent apartment illuminated with wax-candles, and &s;et but with
as many card-tables, as the route of a foreign amba&s;&s;ador's lady. Here
Faro, Whi&s;t, Brag, Lan&s;quenet, and every other fa&s;hionable game make up
the evening's entertainment. This piece of politene&s;s has &s;ometimes fallen
heavy on &s;ome hone&s;t country gentlemen, who have found dining with his
lord&s;hip turn out a very dear ordinary; and many a good lady has had
occa&s;ion to <PB N="483" REF="64"> cur&s;e the cards, and her ill-&s;tarred
connections with per|&s;ons of quality: though his lord&s;hip is never at a
lo&s;s for a party, for as &s;everal people of fa&s;hion have &s;eats near him,
he often &s;its down with &s;ome of his friends of the club at
<HI>White</HI>'s. I had almo&s;t forgot to mention that her lady&s;hip
<HI>keeps a day,</HI> which is Sunday.</P>
<P>THIS, Dear Cou&s;in, is the genteel manner of living in the
country; and I cannot help ob&s;erving, that per&s;ons polite enough to be fond
of &s;uch exqui&s;ite refinements, are partly in the &s;ame ca&s;e with the
mechanic at his du&s;ty villa. They both, indeed, change their &s;ituation; but
neither find the lea&s;t alteration in their ideas. The trade&s;man, when at
his box, has all the notions that employ him in his compting-hou&s;e: and the
nobleman, though in the far|the&s;t part of <HI>England,</HI> may &s;till be
&s;aid to breath the air of St. <HI>James</HI>'s.</P>
<P>I WAS chiefly induced to &s;end you this &s;hort account of
the refined manner, in which per&s;ons of fa&s;hion pa&s;s their time at Lord
<HI>Courtley</HI>'s, becau&s;e I think it a very &s;triking contra&s;t to the
character de&s;cribed in the inclo&s;ed paper. I hope your readers will not do
either you or me the honour to think this natural de&s;cription a mere creature
of the ima|gination. The picture of the extraordinary gentleman here
de&s;cribed is now at the &s;eat of Lord <HI>Shaft&s;bury</HI> at St.
<HI>Giles</HI>'s near <HI>Cranborn</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> and this
lively character of him was really and truly drawn by <HI>Anthony A&s;hly
Cowper,</HI> fir&s;t Earl of <HI>Shaft&s;bury,</HI> and is in&s;cribed on the
picture. I doubt not but you will be glad of being able to communicate it to
the public, and that they will receive it with their u&s;ual candour.</P>

<HEAD>The Character of the Honourable W. HASTINGS of
<HI>Woodlands</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire;</HI> Second Son of FRANCIS Earl of
<HI>Huntingdon.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1638 lived Mr. <HI>Ha&s;tings</HI>; by his
Quality Son, Brother, and Uncle to the Earls of <HI>Huntingdon.</HI> He was
peradventure an original in our Age; or rather the Copy of our ancient
Nobility, in hunting, not in warlike times.</P>
<P>He was low, very &s;trong and very active; of a
reddi&s;h flaxen Hair. His Cloaths always green Cloth, and never all worth
(when new) five Pounds.</P>
<P>His Hou&s;e was perfectly of the old Fa&s;hion, in the
mid&s;t of a large Park well &s;tocked with Deer; and near the Hou&s;e Rabits
to &s;erve his Kitchen; many Fi&s;hponds; great &s;tore of Wood and Timber; a
Bowling Green in it, long but narrow, full of high Ridges, it being never
levell'd &s;ince it was plough'd. They u&s;ed round Sand Bowls; and it had a
Banquetting Hou&s;e like a Stand, built in a Tree.</P>
<P>He kept all Manner of Sport Hounds, that ran Buck, Fox,
Hare, Otter, and Badger. And Hawks, long and &s;hort winged. He had all Sorts
of Nets for Fi&s;h. He had a Walk in the <HI>New Fore&s;t,</HI> and the Manor
of <HI>Chri&s;t-Church.</HI> This la&s;t &s;upply'd him with Red Deer, Sea and
River Fi&s;h. And indeed all his Neighbours Grounds and Royalties were free to
him, who be&s;tow'd all his Time on the&s;e Sports, but what he borrow'd to
care&s;s his Neighbours Wives and Daughters; there being not a Woman in all his
Walks, of the Degree of a Yeoman's Wife or under, and under the Age of forty,
but it was extremely her Fault, if he was not intimately acquainted with her.
This made him very po|pular; always &s;peaking kindly to the Hu&s;band, Brother
or Father: who was to boat, very welcome to his Hou&s;e, whenever he came.
There he found Beef, Pudding, and <PB N="485" REF="66"> &s;mall Beer in great
plenty. A Hou&s;e not &s;o neatly kept as to &s;hame <HI>Him</HI> or his dirty
&s;hoes: the great Hall &s;trow'd with Marrow-bones, full of Hawks-Perches,
Hounds, Spaniels and Terriers: the upper Side of the Hall hung with Fox-&s;kins
of this and the la&s;t Year's kiiling; here and there a Pole-Cat intermixt;
Game-keepers and Hunter's Poles in great Abundance.</P>
<P>The Parlour was a large Room as properly furni&s;hed. On
a great Hearth paved with Brick lay &s;ome Terriers, and the choice&s;t Hounds
and Spaniels. Seldom but two of the great Chairs had litters of young Cats in
them; which were not to be di&s;turbed; he having always three or four
attend|ing him at Dinner; and a little white round Stick of fourteen Inches
lying by his Trencher, that he might defend &s;uch Meat as he had no mind to
part with to them. The Win|dows (which were very large) &s;erved for Places to
lay his Arrows, Cro&s;s-Bows, Stone-Bows, and other &s;uch like Ac|coutrements.
The Corners of the Room full of the be&s;t-cho&s;e Hunting and Hawking Poles.
An Oy&s;ter Table at the lower End, which was of con&s;tant U&s;e twice a Day
all the Year round. For he never failed to eat Oy&s;ters, before Dinner and
Supper, through all Sea&s;ons; the neighb'ring Town of <HI>Pool</HI> &s;upply'd
him with them.</P>
<P>The upper part of the Room had two &s;mall Tables and a
De&s;k, on the one &s;ide of which was a Church Bible, and on the other the
Book of Martyrs. On the Table were Hawks-Hoods, Bells, and &s;uch like; two or
three old green Hats, with their Crowns thru&s;t in &s;o as to hold ten or a
dozen Eggs, which were of a Phea&s;ant kind of Poultry he took much care of and
fed him&s;elf. Tables, Dice, Cards, and Boxes were not wanting. In the Hole of
the De&s;k were &s;tore of Tobacco Pipes that had been u&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="486" REF="67">On one Side of this End of the Room
was the Door of a Clo&s;et wherein &s;tood the Strong Beer and the Wine, which
never came thence but in &s;ingle Gla&s;&s;es; that being the Rule of the
Hou&s;e exactly ob&s;erv'd. For he never exceeded in Drink or permitted it.</P>
<P>On the other Side was the Door into an old Chapel, not
u&s;ed for Devotion. The Pulpit, as the &s;afe&s;t Place, was never wanting of
a cold Chine of Beef, Veni&s;on Pa&s;ty, Gammon of Bacon, or great Apple-pye
with thick Cru&s;t, extremely baked.</P>
<P>His Table co&s;t him not much; though it was good to eat
at. His Sports &s;upplied all but Beef and Mutton, except Fridays, when he had
the be&s;t Saltfi&s;h (as well as other Fi&s;h) he could get; and was the Day
his Neighbours of be&s;t Quality mo&s;t vi&s;ited him. He never wanted a
<HI>London</HI> Pudding, and always &s;ung it in with <HI>My Part lies
therein-a.</HI> He drank a Gla&s;s or two of Wine at Meals; very often Sy|rup
of Gilly-flower in his Sack; and had always a Tun Gla&s;s, without Feet,
&s;tood by him, holding a Pint of Small-Beer which he often &s;tirr'd with
Ro&s;emary.</P>
<P>He was well natured but &s;oon angry, calling his
Servants, Ba&s;tards and cuckoldy Knaves, in one of which he often &s;poke
Truth to his own Knowledge; and &s;ometimes in both, though of the &s;ame Man.
He lived to be an hundred; never lo&s;t his Eye-&s;ight, but always wrote and
read without Spectacles; and got on Hor&s;eback without Help. Until pa&s;t
four&s;core he rode to the Death of a Stag as well as any.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you are now going to the Univer&s;ity, I would not be
thought to pay &s;o ill a compliment to your own natural good &s;en&s;e, as to
&s;uppo&s;e, that you will not (like many young gentlemen of fortune) in &s;ome
mea&s;ure apply your&s;elf to &s;tudy: otherwi&s;e the time you &s;pend there 
<PB N="494" REF="69"> will be entirely lo&s;t; for (as the SPECTATOR very
ju&s;tly remarks) 
<Q REND="inline">"all ornamental parts of education are better
taught in other places."</Q> At the &s;ame time I do not mean, that you
&s;hould commence Pedant, and be continu|ally poring on a book; &s;ince that
will rather puzzle than inform the under&s;tanding. Though I know many
&s;prightly young gentlemen of lively and quick parts affect to de&s;pi&s;e it
altogether, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to learn &s;omething of Lo|gic; I mean in
the &s;ame manner one would learn Fencing&mdash;not to attack others, but to
defend one's &s;elf. In a word, you will find it a great unhappine&s;s, when
you return hither, if you do not bring with you &s;ome ta&s;te for reading: for
a mere Country Gentleman, who can find no &s;ociety in books, will have little
el&s;e to do, (be&s;ides following his &s;ports,) but to &s;it (as &s;quire of
the company) tippling among a parcel of idle wretches, who&s;e under&s;tandings
are nearly on a level with his dogs and hor&s;es.</P>
<P>IT has been an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, that the world will
always form an opinion of per&s;ons according to the company they are known to
keep. In the Univer&s;ity, as well as in other places, there are people, whom
we ought to avoid, as we would the plague: and as it is of the utmo&s;t
con&s;e|quence, whether you plunge at once into extravagance and debauchery, or
&s;ink gradually into indolence and &s;tupidity, I &s;hall point out &s;ome of
the&s;e pe&s;ts of &s;ociety in as few words as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t per&s;on I would caution you again&s;t, is the
wretch that takes a delight to turn religion into ridicule: one that employs
that &s;peech, which was given him by God to celebrate his prai&s;e, in
que&s;tioning his very being. This, as it is impious in it&s;elf, is likewi&s;e
the height of <PB N="495" REF="70"> ill-manners. It is hoped there are but few
of them to be met with in a place of &s;ound doctrine and religious education:
but wherever they are, they ought as much as po&s;&s;ible to be avoided: and if
they will force them&s;elves into our com|pany, they &s;hould be u&s;ed with
the &s;ame contempt, with which they have the hardine&s;s to treat their Maker.
And this, I can a&s;&s;ure you, may be done &s;afely: for I never knew any
body, who pretended to be above the fear of God, but was under the mo&s;t
terrible apprehen&s;ions, whenever attacked by man.</P>
<P>THE next character whom I would advi&s;e you to &s;hun, is the
GAMESTER, in &s;ome re&s;pects not unlike the former. The gaming-table is his
&s;hrine, and fortune his deity; nor does he ever &s;peak or think of any
other, unle&s;s by way of bla&s;phemy, oaths and cur&s;es, when he has had a
bad run at cards or dice, He has not the lea&s;t notion of friend|&s;hip; but
would ruin his own brother, if it might be of any advantage to him&s;elf. He,
indeed, profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf your friend; but that is only with a de&s;ign
to draw you in: for his trade is incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of honour
or ju&s;tice, without which there can be no real friend&s;hip. It &s;hould
therefore be the care of every gentleman not to hold any commerce with &s;uch
people, who&s;e acquaintance he cannot enjoy, without giving up his
e&s;tate.</P>
<P>THE next per&s;on, whom you ought to beware of, is a DRUNKARD;
one that takes an unaccountable plea&s;ure in &s;apping his con&s;titution, and
drowning his under&s;tanding. He con&s;tantly goes &s;en&s;ele&s;s to bed, and
ri&s;es mauki&s;h in the morning: nor can he be ea&s;y in body or mind, 'till
he has renewed his do&s;e, and again put him&s;elf beyond the reach of
reflection. I would therefore entreat you by all <PB N="142" REF="71"> means to
avoid an habit, which will at once ruin your health, and impair your
intellects. It is a misfortune, that &s;ociety &s;hould be e&s;teemed dull and
in&s;ipid without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the bottle to enliven it; &s;o that a
man cannot entirely refrain from his gla&s;s, if he keeps any company at all.
But let it be remembered, that in drinking, as well as in talking, we ought
always to keep a 
<Q REND="inline">"watch over the doors of our lips."</Q></P>
<P>A LOWNGER is a creature, that you will often &s;ee lolling in
a coffee-hou&s;e, or &s;auntering about the &s;treets, with great calmne&s;s,
and a mo&s;t inflexible &s;tupidity in his coun|tenance. He takes as much pains
as the Sot, to fly from his own thoughts, and is at length happily arrived at
the highe&s;t pitch of indolence both in mind and body. He would be as
inoffen&s;ive, as he is dull, if it were not that his idlene&s;s is contagious;
for, like the <HI>torpedo,</HI> he is &s;ure to benumb and take away all
&s;en&s;e of feeling from every one, with whom he happens to come in
contact.</P>
<P>IT were al&s;o be&s;t to forbear the company of a WRANG|LER,
or a per&s;on of a litigious temper. This &s;ometimes ari&s;es, not from any
great &s;hare of ill-nature, but from a vain pride of &s;howing one's parts, or
&s;kill in argumentation. It is frequently ob&s;erved of young Academics in
particular, that they are very apt impertinently to engage people in a
di&s;pute whether they will or not. But this is contrary to all the rules of
good-breeding, and is never practi&s;ed by any man of &s;en&s;e, that has
&s;een much of the world. I have &s;ome|times known a per&s;on of great
&s;aucine&s;s, and volubility of expre&s;&s;ion, confuted by the <HI>Argumentum
Baculinum,</HI> and both his head and his &s;yllogi&s;m broken at the &s;ame
time.</P>
<P><PB N="497" REF="72">I NEED not point out to you the
profligate RAKE or the affected COXCOMB, as per&s;ons from who&s;e company you
can reap no &s;ort of benefit. From the fir&s;t the good principles, already
in&s;tilled into you, will doubtle&s;s pre&s;erve you; and I am &s;ure you have
too much real &s;en&s;e, not to de&s;pi&s;e the ab&s;urd fopperies of the
latter. Noted LYARS are no le&s;s to be avoided, as the common pe&s;ts of
&s;ociety. They are often of a mi&s;chievous di&s;po&s;ition, and by their
calumnies and fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions take a plea&s;ure in &s;etting the mo&s;t
intimate friends at variance. But if they only deal in harmle&s;s and
improbable lies, their acquaintance mu&s;t fre|quently be out of countenance
for them: and if we &s;hould venture to repeat after them, I am &s;ure it is
the way to be out of countenance for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>BUT above all I mu&s;t advi&s;e you never to engage, at
lea&s;t not with any degree of violence, in any PARTY. Be not tran&s;ported by
the clamorous jollity of talking patriots be|yond the &s;ober dictates of
rea&s;on and ju&s;tice; nor let the in&s;inuating voice of corruption tempt you
to barter your integrity and peace of mind for the paultry &s;ati&s;faction of
improving your fortune. If you behave with honour and prudence, you will be
regarded and courted by all parties; but if otherwi&s;e, you will certainly be
de&s;pi&s;ed by all. Per|haps indeed, if you &s;hould hereafter engage in
elections, and &s;pend your own money to &s;upport another's cau&s;e, the
per&s;on, in who&s;e intere&s;t you are, may &s;hake you by the hand, and
&s;wear you are a very hone&s;t gentleman:&mdash;ju&s;t as butchers treat their
bull-dogs, who &s;pit in their mouths, clap them on the back, and then halloo
them on to be to&s;&s;ed and torn by the horns of their antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>AFTER having guarded you again&s;t the evil influence of your
own &s;ex, I cannot conclude without throwing in a <PB N="198" REF="73"> word
or two concerning the Ladies. But that I may not be thought unmannerly to the
fair, I &s;hall pa&s;s over their faults; only hoping, that their excellencies
will not tempt you to precipitate a match with one much your inferior in birth
and fortune, though 
<Q REND="inline">"endowed with every accom|pli&s;hment
requi&s;ite to make the marriage &s;tate happy."</Q> In the&s;e ha&s;ty and
unequal matches it &s;ometimes happens, that mutual love gives way to mutual
reproaches. We may per|haps too late repent of our bargain: and though
Repentance be an excellent vi&s;iting friend, when &s;he reminds us of our
pa&s;t mi&s;carriages, and pre&s;cribes rules how to avoid them for the future,
yet &s;he is a mo&s;t trouble&s;ome companion, when fixed upon us for life.</P>

<P>_SINCE genius is the chief requi&s;ite in all kinds of poetry,
nothing can be more con|trary to the very e&s;&s;ence of it, than the adopting,
as beauties, certain arts, which are merely mechanical. There are daily
ari&s;ing many whim&s;ical excellencies which have no foun|dation in nature,
but are only countenanced by the pre&s;ent mode of writing: with the&s;e it is
as ea&s;y to fill our compo|&s;itions as to dre&s;s our&s;elves in the
fa&s;hion; but the writer, who puts his work together in this manner, is no
more a poet than his taylor. Such productions often betray great labour and
exactne&s;s, but &s;hew no genius: for tho&s;e who &s;it down to write by rule,
and follow 
<Q REND="inline">"dry receipts how <PB N="500" REF="75"> poems
&s;hould be made,"</Q> may compo&s;e their pieces with|out the lea&s;t
a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the imagination; as an apothe|cary's prentice; though
unable to cure any di&s;ea&s;e, can make up medicines from the phy&s;ician's
pre&s;cription, with no more knowledge of phy&s;ic than the names of the drugs.
Thus the Mu&s;e that ought to fly, and 
<Q REND="inline">"a&s;cend the brighte&s;t heaven of
invention,"</Q> walks in leading-&s;trings, or is &s;up|ported by a
go-cart.</P>
<P>AMONG the many poetical tricks of this &s;ort, none has been
more &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed, or had more advocates and admirers, than a
certain fanta&s;tical conceit called ALLITERA|TION: which is nothing more than
beginning two, three, or perhaps every word in a line with the &s;ame letter.
This method of running divi&s;ions upon the alphabet, and pre&s;&s;ing
particular letters into the &s;ervice, has been accounted one of the fir&s;t
excellencies in ver&s;ification, and has indeed received the &s;anction of
&s;ome of our be&s;t poets; but wherein the beauty of it con&s;i&s;ts, is
&s;omething difficult to di&s;cover: &s;ince <HI>Quarles</HI> or
<HI>Withers</HI> might practi&s;e it with as much adroit|ne&s;s as
<HI>Dryden</HI> or <HI>Spen&s;er.</HI> It is one of tho&s;e modern arts in
poetry which require no fancy, judgment, or learning in the execution: for an
author may huddle the &s;ame letters on each other again and again, as
mechanically as the printer &s;elects his types, and ranges them in
what&s;oever order he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>THIS partial attachment to particular letters is a kind of
contra&s;t to the famous Ody&s;&s;ey of <HI>Tryphiodorus,</HI> where every
letter in the alphabet was in its turn excluded: and the Al|literator mu&s;t be
as bu&s;ily employed to introduce his favou|rite vowel or con&s;onant, as the
<HI>Greek</HI> poet to &s;hut out the let|ter he had pro&s;cribed. Nothing is
e&s;teemed a greater beauty <PB N="501" REF="76"> in poetry than a happy choice
of epithets; but Alliteration reduces all the elegancies of expre&s;&s;ion to a
very narrow com|pa&s;s. Epithets are culled indeed with great exactne&s;s, but
the clo&s;e&s;t relation they are intended to bear to the word to which they
are joined, is that the initials are the &s;ame. Thus the <HI>fields</HI>
mu&s;t be <HI>flowry, beauty</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>beaming, ladies</HI> mu&s;t be
<HI>lovely,</HI> and in the &s;ame manner mu&s;t the 
<Q REND="inline">"waves wind their watry way,"</Q> the 
<Q REND="inline">"blu&s;tring bla&s;ts blow,"</Q> and 
<Q REND="inline">"locks all loo&s;ely lay,"</Q> not for the
&s;ake of the poetry, but the elegance of the Alliteration. This beauty has
al&s;o taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of many of our tragedies, and I have &s;een
ladies wooed and heroes killed in it: though I mu&s;t own I never hear an actor
dying with deadly darts and fiery flames &amp;c. but it always puts me in mind
of the celebrated pippin-woman in <HI>Gay</HI>'s <HI>Trivia,</HI> who&s;e head,
when it was &s;evered from her body, rolled along the ice crying <HI>pip, pip,
pip,</HI> and expired in Alliteration.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame fal&s;e ta&s;te in writing that 
<Q REND="inline">"wings di&s;play'd and altars rais'd,"</Q>
al&s;o introduced Alliteration; and Acro&s;|tics in particular are the &s;ame
kind of &s;pelling-book poetry. It is therefore &s;omewhat extraordinary that
tho&s;e &s;ublime writers, who have di&s;graced their pages with it, did not
leave this as well as the other barbarous parts of literature to the
<HI>Goths</HI> in poetry: &s;ince it is a whim&s;ical beauty, below the
practice of any writer, &s;uperior to him who turned the <HI>Aencid</HI> into
Monki&s;h ver&s;es. <HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> who was more indebted to nature
than art, has ridiculed this low trick with great humour in his burle&s;que
tragedy of <HI>Pyramus</HI> and <HI>Thi&s;be.</HI> Be&s;ides that noted
pa&s;&s;age of 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;With blade, with bloody, blameful blade</L> 
<L>He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody brea&s;t,</L></Q> 
<PB N="502" REF="77"> He before introduces a mock rant, which <HI>Bottom</HI>
calls <HI>Ercles'</HI> vein, which is not only rank fu&s;tian, but is al&s;o
remarkable for its Alliteration. <HI>To make all &s;plit the raging rocks, and
&s;hivering &s;hocks &s;hall break the locks of pri&s;on gates&mdash;and</HI>
Phibbus <HI>car &s;hall &s;hine from far, and make and mar the fooli&s;h
fates.</HI> In this &s;trange &s;tile have whole poems been written, and every
learned reader will recollect on this occa&s;ion the <HI>Pugna Porcorum per P.
Porcium Poetam,</HI> which I wi&s;h &s;ome of our poeta&s;ters would
tran&s;late, in the true &s;pirit of the original, and prai&s;e pigs and pork
with all the beauties of Alliteration.</P>
<P>THE advocates and admirers of this practice have a&s;&s;ert|ed,
that it adds &s;ignificance and &s;trength of expre&s;&s;ion to their ver&s;es,
but I fear this boa&s;ted energy &s;eldom appears to the reader. The
Alliteration either remains unregarded, or, if it is very &s;triking,
di&s;gu&s;ts tho&s;e who perceive it, and is often in it&s;elf, from &s;uch a
di&s;agreeable clu&s;ter of the &s;ame letters, har&s;h and uncouth. There are
very many in&s;tances where Alliteration, though &s;tudiou&s;ly introduced,
renders the ver&s;ification rough and inharmonious; and I will appeal to the
greatest lovers of it, whether the following line, where the repetition was
&s;carce intended, is one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing in all <HI>Virgil</HI>'s
works. 
<Q> 
<L>Neu patriae Validas in Vi&s;cera Vertite Vires.</L></Q></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be acknowledged, that there is &s;omething very
mechanical in the whole con&s;truction of the numbers in mo&s;t of our modern
poetry. Sound is more attended to than &s;en&s;e, and the words are expected to
expre&s;s more than the &s;entiment. There are &s;et rules to make ver&s;es run
off glibly, or drawl &s;lowly on, &amp;c. and I have read many a 
<PB N="502" REF="78"> poem with &s;carce one tolerable thought in it, that has
con|tained all the&s;e excellencies of ver&s;ification: for which rea&s;on I
mu&s;t confe&s;s my&s;elf no friend to tho&s;e critics, who analy&s;e words and
&s;yllables, and di&s;cover latent beauties in every letter, when the author
intended that the whole &s;hould be taken together. Poetry &s;hould &s;eem at
lea&s;t to flow freely from the imagination, and not to be &s;queezed from the
droppings of the brain. If we would endeavour to acquire a full idea of what we
mean to de&s;cribe, we &s;hould then of cour&s;e expre&s;s our&s;elves with
force, elegance, and per&s;pi|cuity: and this native &s;trength of
expre&s;&s;ion would have more true energy than elaborate phra&s;es, and a
quaint and &s;tudied combination of words and letters. Fine numbers are
undoubtedly one of the chief beauties in poetry; but to make the &s;ound echo
to the &s;en&s;e, we &s;hould make the &s;en&s;e our chief object. This appears
to me to have been the manly practice of the Ancients, and of our own
<HI>Shake|&s;peare, Milton,</HI> &amp;c. who breathed the true &s;pirit of
poetry, without having recour&s;e to little tricks and mean artifices, which
only &s;erve to di&s;grace it. A good writer, who would be above triffling even
with a thought, would never per&s;ue words, and play with letters, but leave
&s;uch a childi&s;h em|ployment for the &s;mall fry of rhimers who amu&s;e
them|&s;elves with anagrams and crambo. The true poet tru&s;ts to his natural
ear and &s;trong conception, and knows that the ver&s;ification is adapted to
the &s;entiment without culling particular letters, and &s;tringing them on his
lines; as he is &s;ure that his ver&s;es are ju&s;t mea&s;ure, without
&s;canning them on his fingers.</P>
<P>THERE are almo&s;t daily publi&s;hed certain Lilliputian
volumes, entitled <HI>Pretty Books for Children.</HI> A friend of mine 
<PB N="503" REF="79"> who con&s;iders the little rhimers of the age as only 
<Q REND="inline">"children of a larger growth,"</Q> who amu&s;e
them&s;elves with rhimes in&s;tead of rattles, propo&s;es to publi&s;h a
&s;mall pocket volume for the u&s;e of our Poeta&s;ters. It will be a
treati&s;e on the art of poetry <HI>adapted to the meane&s;t capacities,</HI>
for which &s;ub|&s;criptions will be taken, and &s;pecimens may be &s;een, at
<HI>George</HI>'s and the <HI>Bedford</HI> coffee-hou&s;es. It will contain
full directions how to modulate the numbers on every occa|&s;ion, and will
in&s;truct the young &s;cribbler in all the modern arts of ver&s;ification. He
will here meet with infallible rules how to &s;often a line and lull us to
&s;leep with liquids and dipthongs; to roughen the ver&s;e and make it roar
again with reiteration of the letter R; to &s;et it hi&s;&s;ing with
&s;emi|vowels; to make it pant and breathe short with a hun|dred heavy
a&s;pirates; or clog it up with the thicke&s;t double con&s;onants and
mono&s;yllables: with a particular table of Al|literation, containing the
choice&s;t epithets for any words that can be wanted. To be illu&s;trated with
examples from the modern poets. The whole to be publi&s;hed about the mid|dle
of the winter under the title of <HI>The Rhimer's Play-thing,</HI> or,
<HI>Poeta&s;ter's Horn-book;</HI> &s;ince there is nothing nece&s;&s;ary to
form &s;uch a poet, except teaching him his letters.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_YOU obliged the world &s;ome time ago with a few reflections
on the Gentlemen of the Army: at the pre&s;ent juncture, a word or two on our
Sea-Officers would not be un|&s;ea&s;onable. I do not mean that you &s;hould
pre&s;ume to direct them how to behave in their &s;everal &s;tations, but
rather to remark on their conduct and conver|&s;ation in private life, as far
as they are influenced by their maritime characters. There is a certain
unfa&s;hionable dye, which their manners often take from the &s;alt-water, that
tinctures their whole behaviour on &s;hore. If you could <PB N="506" REF="81">
a&s;&s;i&s;t in blotting out the&s;e &s;tains, and give a new colour to their
conduct, you would add grace and politene&s;s to their ordinary conver&s;ation,
and would be of as much &s;ervice to our naval commanders in this point, as he
was to navigation in general, who fir&s;t invented the compa&s;s.</P>
<P>AS the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e fair-weather foplings, many
of whom may be met with in the three regiments of guards, is u&s;ually flat and
in&s;ipid, that of our &s;ea-officers is turbulent and boi&s;terous: and as a
trip to <HI>Paris</HI> has perhaps over-refined the coxcomb in red, a voyage
round the world fre|quently brutalizes the &s;eaman, who comes home &s;o rough
and unpoli&s;hed, that one would imagine he had not vi&s;ited any nation in the
world except the Savages, the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> or the <HI>Hottentots.</HI>
The many advantages he has received from having &s;een the cu&s;toms and
manners of &s;o many different people, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, would
render his conver|&s;ation very de&s;irable, as being in it&s;elf particularly
in&s;tructive and entertaining: but this roughne&s;s, which clings to the
&s;eaman's behaviour like tar to his trow&s;ers, makes him un|fit for all civil
and polite &s;ociety. He behaves at an a&s;&s;embly as if he was upon deck; and
his whole deportment mani|fe&s;tly betrays, that he is, according to the common
phra&s;e, quite out of his element. Nor can you collect any more from him
concerning the &s;everal nations he has vi&s;ited, than if he had been during
the whole time confined to his cabin: and he &s;eems to know as little of them,
as the fine gentleman of his travels after the polite tour, when he has, for
the &s;ake of improvement, rid po&s;t through all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>THAT our ordinary &s;eamen, who are, many of them draughted
from the very lowe&s;t of the populace, &s;hould be thus uncivilized, is no
wonder. The common &s;ailor's <PB N="507" REF="82"> education in <HI>Broad St.
Giles's, Tottenham Court,</HI> or at <HI>Hock|ley in the Hole,</HI> has not
qualified him to improve by ju&s;t reflections on what he &s;ees during his
voyage; and going on board a man of war is a kind of univer&s;ity education,
&s;uitably adapted to the principles imbibed in the polite &s;emi|naries, which
he came from. A common &s;ailor too is full as polite as a common &s;oldier;
and behaves as genteely to a <HI>Wapping</HI> landlady as the gentleman
&s;oldier at a &s;uttling-hou&s;e. But &s;urely there ought to be as much
difference in the behaviour of the commander and his crew, as there is in their
&s;ituation: and it is beneath the dignity of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Flag to
have an Admiral behave as rudely as a Swabber, or a Commodore as foul-mouthed
as a Boat&s;wain.</P>
<P>IT may perhaps be alledged in excu&s;e, that the being placed
among &s;uch a boi&s;terous &s;et of people, as our com|mon &s;ailors, mu&s;t
unavoidably wear off all politene&s;s and good-manners: as it is remarkable,
that all tho&s;e who are employed in the care of hor&s;es, grow as mere brutes
as the animals they attend; and as we may often ob&s;erve tho&s;e ju&s;tices,
who&s;e chief bu&s;ine&s;s is the examination of high|waymen, hou&s;e-breakers,
and &s;treet-walkers, grow at lea&s;t as vulgar and foul-mouthed as a
pick-pocket. As there may be &s;ome truth in this, the commander &s;hould
therefore be &s;till more on his guard to pre&s;erve the gentleman in his
behaviour, and like the &s;ea it&s;elf, when the &s;torm is over, grow &s;mooth
and calm. It is accounted a piece of humour on the <HI>Thames</HI> to abu&s;e
the other pa&s;&s;engers on the water; and there are certain &s;et terms of
abu&s;e, which fly to and fro from one boat to another on this occa&s;ion. A
wag might perhaps amu&s;e him&s;elf with this water-language in his voyage to
<HI>Vaux-Hall,</HI> but mu&s;t be a very &s;illy fellow indeed, to think of
carrying the joke on &s;hore with him. In <PB N="508" REF="83"> the &s;ame
manner &s;ome roughne&s;s may perhaps be nece&s;&s;ary to keep the crew in
order; but it is ab&s;urd for an officer to retain his har&s;hne&s;s in polite
company: and is in a manner tying his friends up to the yard-arm, and
di&s;ciplining all his acquaintance with the cat-of-nine-tails.</P>
<P>BUT the wor&s;t part of this maritime character is a certain
invincible contempt, which they often contract for all man|kind, except their
fellow-&s;eamen. They look on the re&s;t of the world as a &s;et of
fre&s;h-water wretches, who could be of no &s;ervice in a &s;torm or an
engagement; and from an unaccountable ob&s;tinacy are particularly deaf to any
propo&s;als of new improvements in navigation: though experience daily teaches
them the great u&s;e of the di&s;coveries already made, and how much room there
is for more. They have no notion, how &s;tudious men can &s;it in their
clo&s;ets, and devi&s;e charts and in&s;truments to direct them in their
cour&s;e; and de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e ingenious per&s;ons, who would a&s;&s;i&s;t
them in their undertakings; while they con&s;ider them with the utmo&s;t
contempt, as going round the world in their clo&s;ets, and &s;ailing at &s;ea
in their elbow-chairs. It is no le&s;s &s;hameful than true, that the
Ventilator, one of the mo&s;t beneficial inventions that ever was devi&s;ed,
was fir&s;t offered to the &s;ervice of our men of war, and rejected. It was
fir&s;t u&s;ed in foreign &s;hips, then by our merchantmen, and la&s;t of all
among our men of war, to who&s;e u&s;e it was fir&s;t recom|mended. This is a
&s;trong proof of that fatal ob&s;tinacy, which our Sea-Commanders are too apt
to contract; and as a further in&s;tance of it, I have been told of an
Admiral's indignation on this &s;ubject, venting it&s;elf in the following
manner. 
<Q REND="inline">"A pack of blockheads, (&s;aid he,) &s;it
poring, and pretend to make improvements for our u&s;e. They 
<PB N="509" REF="84"> tell you that they di&s;cover this, and di&s;cover that;
but I tell you they are all fools.&mdash;For in&s;tance now, they &s;ay the
world is round; every one of them &s;ays the world is round;&mdash;but I have
been all round the world, and it is as flat as this table."</Q></P>
<P>THE chief rea&s;on of their unpoli&s;hed behaviour is owing to
their being often &s;ent to &s;ea very young with little or no education,
beyond what they have received perhaps at the academy of <HI>Woolwich</HI> or
<HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> A lad of good family, but untoward parts, or
mi&s;chievous di&s;po&s;ition, who has been flogged for a while at the
grammar-&s;chool, or &s;nubbed by his parents and friends at home, is
frequently clapped on board a &s;hip in order to tame him, and to teach him
better manners. Here perhaps he at fir&s;t me&s;&s;es with the lowe&s;t of the
&s;eamen: and all that the young gentle|man can learn from his jolly me&s;mates
in the cour&s;e of two or three voyages, is to drink flip, &s;ing a bawdy
catch, and dance an horn-pipe. The&s;e genteel accompli&s;hments he is &s;ure
to retain, as he grows old in the &s;ervice; and if he has the good fortune to
ri&s;e to a command, he is as &s;urly and brutal when advanced to the cabin, as
when he was tugging before the ma&s;t.</P>
<P>AFTER all it is but ju&s;tice to confe&s;s, that there are
many among our Sea-Officers, who de&s;ervedly bear the character of gentlemen
and &s;cholars; and it is ea&s;y to perceive, with how much better grace they
appear in the world than the re&s;t of their brethren, who (when laid up and
taken out of &s;ervice) are as mere logs as the main-ma&s;t. An officer, who
has any reli&s;h for reading, will employ the many vacant hours (in which he is
relieved from duty) much more to his improve|ment <PB N="510" REF="85"> and
&s;atisfaction, than in &s;auntering between the decks, or muddling over a bowl
of punch. I would therefore &s;eri|ou&s;ly recommend it to tho&s;e young
&s;ailors, who have the hap|pine&s;s to launch forth with a genteel and liberal
education, not to &s;uffer every trace of it to be wa&s;hed away, like words
written on the &s;ands; but that, when they return from &s;ea, they may be fit
to be admitted at St. <HI>James</HI>'s, as well as at <HI>Wapping</HI> or
<HI>Rotherhithe.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, I mu&s;t beg leave to &s;ay a word or two
concerning our Sea-Chaplains. The common &s;ailors are known to have, when on
board, a very &s;erious regard for religion; and their decent behaviour at
prayers, and &s;edate attention to the &s;ermon upon quarter-deck, might
&s;hame a more polite audience at St. <HI>James</HI>'s Church. For this
rea|&s;on a truly religious Chaplain of good morals and &s;ober con|ver&s;ation
will nece&s;&s;arily have as much influence on their be|haviour, as a mild and
prudent Commander: Nor can a clergyman be too circum&s;pect in this point;
&s;ince, if he does not act in every re&s;pect conformable to his function, his
place for ought I know might be as well &s;upplied by any one of the
unbeneficed Doctors of the Fleet. In a word, if a Chaplain will &s;o far
dive&s;t him&s;elf of his &s;acred character, as to drink, &s;wear, and behave
in every re&s;pect like a com|mon &s;ailor, he &s;hould be obliged to work in
the gang-way all the re&s;t of the week, and on &s;undays be inve&s;ted with a
jacket and trow&s;ers in&s;tead of his canonicals.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P>_SO long ago as my fourth number (the reader perhaps may not
remember) I made men|tion of a FEMALE THERMOMETER, con&s;tructed by my
ingenious friend Mr. <HI>James Ay&s;cough,</HI> Optician, on
<HI>Ludgate-Hill</HI>; and I then informed the public, that 
<Q REND="inline">"the liquor contained within the tube was a
chymical mixture, which being acted upon by the circulation of the blood and
animal &s;pirits, would ri&s;e and fall according to the de&s;ires and
affections of the wearer."</Q> But I have now the further &s;atisfaction to
acquaint my fair readers, that after &s;everal repeated trials and improvements
we have at length brought <PB N="512" REF="87"> the in&s;trument to &s;o great
a degree of perfection, that any common by-&s;tander may, by a proper
application of it, know the exact temperature of any lady's pa&s;&s;ions. The
liquor, among other &s;ecret ingredients, is di&s;tilled <HI>&s;ecund&uacute;m
artem</HI> from the herbs lady's love, and maiden-hair, the wax of virgin-bees,
and the five greater hot and cold &s;eeds: and the properties of it are &s;o
&s;ubtle and penetrating, that immediately on its coming within the
atmo&s;phere of a lady's affections, it is actuated by them in the &s;ame
manner, as the &s;pirits are by the impul&s;e of the air in the common
Ther|mometer.</P>
<P>IT was not without &s;ome difficulty, that we could &s;ettle the
different degrees of heat and cold in a lady's de&s;ires, which it would be
proper to delineate on our Thermometer: but at la&s;t we found, that the whole
&s;cale of female characters might be reduced to one or other of the
fol|lowing; <HI>viz.</HI> 
<LIST>
<ITEM>Abandoned IMPUDENCE.</ITEM>
<ITEM>&mdash; GALLANTRY.</ITEM>
<ITEM>&mdash; LOOSE BEHAVIOUR.</ITEM>
<ITEM>&mdash; INNOCENT FREEDOMS.</ITEM>
<ITEM>&mdash; INDISCRETIONS.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Inviolable MODESTY.</ITEM>
</LIST> </P>
<P>FROM the&s;e degrees, which we have accurately marked on the
&s;ide of the tube, we have been able to judge of the characters of &s;everal
ladies, on whom we have made the experiment. In &s;ome of the&s;e we have found
the grada|tions very &s;udden; and that the liquor has ri&s;en very fa&s;t from
the lowe&s;t point to the highe&s;t. We could likewi&s;e di&s;cover, that it
was differently affected according to the <PB N="513" REF="88"> different
&s;tation and quality of the &s;ubject: &s;o that the &s;ame actions, which in
a lady of fa&s;hion &s;carce rai&s;ed the liquor beyond INDISCRETIONS, in
another cau&s;ed it to mount almo&s;t to IMPUDENCE. Much al&s;o depended upon
the air and temperature of the place, where we made our trials: and even the
dre&s;s had &s;ome influence on our Thermo|meter; as we frequently ob&s;erved,
that the ri&s;e and fall of the liquor in the tube bore an exact proportion to
the ri&s;e and fall of the &s;tays and petticoat.</P>
<P>I SHALL now proceed to give a &s;uccinct account of the many
repeated experiments, which we have made on differ|ent &s;ubjects in different
places. During the winter &s;ea&s;on we had frequent opportunities of trying
the effects, which the play-hou&s;e, the opera, and other places of
diver&s;ion, might have on the Thermometer. At the play-hou&s;e we always found
the liquor ri&s;e in proportion, as the drama was more or le&s;s indecent or
immoral: at &s;ome comedies, and particularly the <HI>Chances,</HI> its
elevation kept pace exactly with the lu&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the dialogue and the
ripening of the plot; &s;o that it has often happened, that with &s;ome
&s;ubjects, at the opening of the play, the liquor has &s;truggled a-while, and
ro&s;e and &s;unk about the degrees ju&s;t above MODESTY; but before the third
act it has &s;tood &s;u&s;pended at the middle point between MODESTY and
IMPUDENCE; in the fourth act it has advanced as far as LOOSE BEHA|VIOUR; and at
the conclu&s;ion of the play it has &s;ettled at downright IMPUDENCE. At public
concerts, and the opera e&s;pecially, we ob&s;erved that the Thermometer
con&s;tantly kept time (if I may &s;ay &s;o) with the mu&s;ic and &s;inging:
and both at the opera and the play-hou&s;e, it always regulated its motions by
the dancer's heels. We have frequently <PB N="514" REF="89"> made trials of our
in&s;trument at the ma&s;querades in the <HI>Hay-Market</HI>: but the
temperature of that climate has proved &s;o exceeding hot, that on the moment
of our coming into the room the liquor has boiled up with a &s;urpri&s;ing
effer|ve&s;cence to ABANDONED IMPUDENCE.</P>
<P>DURING the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on we have not failed to make our
ob&s;ervations on the company at the public gardens. Here we found, indeed,
that with &s;ome raw unpoli&s;hed females, who came only to eat chee&s;e-cakes
and &s;ee the fire-works, the liquor did not &s;tir beyond MODESTY; with many
it has crept up to INDISCRETIONS; and with &s;ome it has advanced to LOOSE
BEHAVIOUR. We had no opportunity to try our Thermometer in the dark walks: but
with &s;ome &s;ubjects we have plainly perceived the liquor ha&s;tening up
towards INNOCENT FREEDOMS, as they were retiring to the&s;e walks from the
re&s;t of the company; whil&s;t with others, who have gone the &s;ame way, it
has only con|tinued to point (as it did at the beginning of our
ob&s;er|vations) at GALLANTRY. One young lady in particular we could not help
remarking, whom we followed into <HI>Vaux-Hall,</HI> gallanted by an officer;
we were glad to &s;ee, at her fir&s;t going in, that the liquor, though it now
and then faintly a&s;pired towards INDISCRETIONS, &s;till gravitated back again
to MODESTY: after a turn or two in the walks we perceived it fluctuating
between INNOCENT FREEDOMS and LOOSE BEHAVIOUR: after this we lo&s;t &s;ight of
them for &s;ome time; and at the conclu&s;ion of the entertainment (as we
followed them out) we could not without concern ob&s;erve, that the liquor was
ha&s;tily bubbling up to a degree next to IMPUDENCE.</P>
<P><PB N="515" REF="90">BESIDES the experiments on tho&s;e ladies,
who frequent the public places of diver&s;ion, we have been no le&s;s careful
in making remarks at &s;everal private routs and a&s;&s;emblies. We were here
at fir&s;t very much &s;urpri&s;ed at the extreme degree of <HI>Cold</HI> which
our Thermometer &s;eemed to indicate in &s;everal ladies, who were &s;eated
round the card-tables; as we found not the lea&s;t alteration in it either from
the young or old: but we at la&s;t concluded, that this was owing to their love
of play, which had totally ab&s;orbed all their other pa&s;&s;ions. We have,
indeed, more than once perceived, that when a lady has ri&s;en from cards after
&s;o much ill luck as to have involved her&s;elf in a debt of honour to a
gentle|man, the Thermometer has been &s;urpri&s;ingly effected; and as &s;he
has been handed to her chair, we have known the liquor, which before was quite
&s;tagnate, run up in&s;tantane|ou&s;ly to the degree of GALLANTRY. We have
al&s;o been at the trouble to try its efficacy in the long rooms at <HI>Bath,
Tun|bridge, Cheltenham</HI> &amp;c. as it is well known, that the&s;e places
have brought about &s;urpri&s;ing changes in the con&s;titutions of tho&s;e
SICK ladies, who go thither for the benefit of the waters.</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;ufficiently proved the perfection of our
Thermometer, it only remains to acquaint my readers, that Mr,
<HI>Ay&s;cough</HI> will be ready to &s;upply the public with the&s;e u&s;eful
in&s;truments, as &s;oon as the town fills. In the mean time I would advi&s;e
tho&s;e ladies, who have the lea&s;t regard for their characters, to reflect
that the gradations, as marked on our Thermometer, naturally lead to each
other; that the tran&s;itions from the lowe&s;t to the highe&s;t are quick and
obvious; and that though it is very ea&s;y to advance, it is impo&s;&s;ible to
recede back again, Let them, therefore, be <PB N="516" REF="91"> careful to
regulate their pa&s;&s;ions in &s;uch manner, as that their conduct may be
always con&s;i&s;tent with decency and honour; and (as <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>
&s;ays) 
<Q REND="inline">"not &s;tepping o'er the bounds of MODESTY."</Q>
I &s;hall conclude with ob&s;erving, that the&s;e Thermometers are de&s;igned
only for the ladies: for though we imagined at fir&s;t, that they might &s;erve
equally for the men, we have found rea&s;on to alter our opinion; &s;ince, in
the cour&s;e of &s;everal fruitle&s;s experiments on our own &s;ex, there has
&s;carce appeared any medium in them between MODESTY and IMPUDENCE.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT has been generally imagined, that learn|ing is only to be
acquired in the clo&s;et, and by turning over a great number of pages; for
which rea&s;on men have been a&s;&s;iduous to heap together a parcel of du&s;ty
volumes, and our youth have been &s;ent to &s;tudy at the univer&s;ities: as if
knowledge was &s;hut up in a library, and chained to the &s;helves together
with the folios. This prejudice has made every one overlook the mo&s;t obvious
and ready means of coming at literature; while (as the wi&s;e man has
re|marked) <PB N="518" REF="93"> 
<Q REND="inline">"Wi&s;dom crieth without; &s;he uttereth her
voice in the &s;treets; &s;he crieth in the chief place of concour&s;e, in the
openings of the gates: in the city &s;he uttereth her words,"</Q> and no man
regardeth her. Every lane teems with in&s;truction, and every alley is big with
erudition: though the ignorant or incurious pa&s;&s;er-by &s;huts his eyes
again&s;t that univer&s;al volume of arts and &s;ciences, which con&s;tantly
lies open before him in the highways and bye-places; like the laws of the
<HI>Romans,</HI> which were hung up in the public &s;treets.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t know, Mr. TOWN, that I am a very hard &s;tudent,
and have perhaps gleaned more knowledge from my reading, than any of your
poring fellows of colleges, though I was never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much
as an horn-book. In the cour&s;e of my &s;tudies I have followed the example of
of the ancient <HI>Peripatetics,</HI> who u&s;ed to &s;tudy walking: and as I
had not the advantage to be brought up a &s;cholar, I have been obliged, like
the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> children, to the public for my education. My fir&s;t
reli&s;h for letters I got by conning over tho&s;e elegant mono&s;yllables,
which are chalked out upon walls and gates, and which (as pretty books for
children are adorned with cuts) are generally en|forced and explained by
curious hieroglyphics in <HI>caricatura.</HI> I &s;oon made a further
progre&s;s in the alphabet by &s;taring up at the large letters upon
play-bills, &amp;c. 'till at length I was enabled to make out the
in&s;criptions upon &s;igns, bills on empty hou&s;es, and the titles on
rubric-po&s;ts. From the&s;e I proceeded gradually to higher branches of
literature, and went through a complete cour&s;e of phy&s;ic by peru&s;ing the
learned treati&s;es of Dr. <HI>Rock</HI> and other eminent practi|tioners.
Having thus laid in the rudiments of literature, my <PB N="519" REF="94">
method has &s;ince been to vi&s;it the <HI>Philobiblian</HI> libraries, and
other learned &s;talls, and the noble collections at <HI>Moor-fields</HI>; in
which choice repo&s;itories I have with infinite plea&s;ure and advantage ran
over the elaborate &s;y&s;tems of ancient divines, politicians, and
philo&s;ophers, which have e&s;caped the fury of pa&s;try-cooks and
trunk-makers. As for the modern writings of pamphletteers and
magazine-compilers, I make it my bu&s;ine&s;s to take my rounds every morning
at the open &s;hops about the <HI>Royal Exchange</HI>; where I never fail to
run through every thing, fre&s;h as it comes out. Thus, for example, I make a
&s;hift to &s;quint over the fir&s;t page of the <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur,</HI> as
it lies before me, at Mrs. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s; at the next &s;hop I &s;teal a
peep at the middle pages, at another proceed on to the fourth or fifth, and
perhaps return again to conclude it at Mrs. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s. By the &s;ame
means I am my&s;elf become a <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur</HI> likewi&s;e; and you will
be &s;ur|pri&s;ed when I a&s;&s;ure you, that I have a great variety of the
fine&s;t prints and paintings, and am ma&s;ter of a more curious &s;et of
nicknacks, than are to be found in Sir <HI>Hans Sloane</HI>'s
<HI>Collection:</HI> for, as I con&s;tantly &s;urvey the windows of every
print&s;hop, and attend every auction, I look upon every curio&s;ity as
actually in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and you will agree with me, that while I
have the opportunity of &s;eeing them, the real owners cannot have more
&s;atisfaction in locking them up in cabinets and mu&s;aeums.</P>
<P>YOU will conclude, that the knowledge, which I have thus
picked out of the &s;treets, has been very exten&s;ive: I have learned at every
corner, that the &s;curvy is a popular di&s;ea&s;e,&mdash;that the bloody flux
cannot be cured by any of the faculty, except the gentlewoman at the blue
po&s;ts in <HI>Haydon Yard,</HI>&mdash;that nervous di&s;ea&s;es were never
&s;o frequent, <PB N="520" REF="95"> &mdash;and that the royal family and
mo&s;t of our nobility are troubled with corns;&mdash;and many other curious
particulars of the &s;ame kind: I have al&s;o got a &s;mattering of the
<HI>French</HI> language from the adverti&s;ements of taylors and &s;taymakers,
and of Mrs. <HI>Dubois</HI>'s portable &s;oop, in <HI>French</HI> and
<HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I was completely grounded in politics by &s;topping at
<HI>Temple Bar</HI> every morning to read the <HI>Gazzetteer,</HI> which u&s;ed
to be pa&s;ted up there to the great emolument of the hackney-coachmen upon
their &s;tands. But above all, I have acquired the mo&s;t &s;ublime notions of
religion by li&s;tening attentively to the &s;pirited harangues of our mo&s;t
eminent field-preach|ers: and I confe&s;s my&s;elf highly obliged to the
itinerant mi&s;&s;ionaries of <HI>We&s;lley, Whitefield,</HI> and
<HI>Zinzendorf,</HI> who have in&s;tructed us in the New Light from empty
barrels and joint-&s;tools. Next to the&s;e, I have received great
im|provements from the vociferous retailers of poetry; as I con&s;tantly u&s;ed
to thru&s;t my&s;elf into the circle gathered round them, and li&s;ten to their
ditties, till I could carry away both words and tune. I have likewi&s;e got
&s;ome notion of the drama by attending the theatres; though my finances were
too &s;canty for me ever to get admittance into them. I therefore had
recour&s;e to the following practice: I would contrive to hear one act at the
out&s;ide of one of the pit-doors; the next act I took my &s;tand at the other;
and as the author generally ri&s;es in the middle, I could catch the mo&s;t
tearing parts during the third act in the pa&s;&s;age to the two-&s;hilling
gallery: in the fourth act the rants came tole|ably loud to my ear at the
entrance of the upper gallery; and I very attentively li&s;tened to the
pathetic at the con|clu&s;ion of the play with the footmen in the lobby.</P>
<P><PB N="521" REF="96">ENDOWED with &s;o much learning, you will
doubtle&s;s be curious to know to what purpo&s;es I have turned it. Al|mo&s;t
before I could read at all, I got into the &s;ervice of a very eminent doctor
of phy&s;ick, who employed me in &s;tick|ing up his bills, and &s;lipping them
&s;lily into the hands of &s;pindle-&s;hanked young fellows, as they pa&s;&s;ed
by. After this, by clo&s;ely &s;tudying the&s;e elegant compo&s;itions, I got
together a &s;ufficient &s;et of medical phra&s;es, which (by the help of
<HI>Bayley</HI>'s dictionary) enabled me to draw up bills and affidavits for
tho&s;e doctors, who were not &s;o happy as to be able to write or read. I was
next promoted to the gar|ret of a printer of bloody murders, where my
bu&s;ine&s;s was to invent terrible &s;tories, write <HI>York&s;hire</HI>
tragedies, or Chri&s;t|mas carrols, and occa&s;ionally to put the Ordinary of
<HI>New|gate</HI>'s Account of Dying Speeches into lamentable rhyme. I was
afterwards concerned in works, that required a greater fund of erudition,
&s;uch as bog-hou&s;e mi&s;cellanies, and little books for children; and I was
once engaged as the principal compiler of a two-penny magazine. Since that I
followed the occupation of an Eves-dropper, or Collector of News for the daily
papers; in which I turned a good penny by hunting after marriages and deaths,
and inventing lyes for the day. Once indeed, being out of other bu&s;ine&s;s, I
de|&s;cended to the mean office of a ballad-&s;inger, and hawked my own
ver&s;es; but not having a good ear for mu&s;ic, and the tone of my voice being
rather inclined to whining, I con|verted my ballads into penitential hymns, and
took up the vocation of Methodi&s;t Preacher. In this &s;tation I made new
converts every day among the old women by my &s;ighs and groans, who in return
contributed their half-pence, which I di&s;po&s;ed of in charity&mdash;to
my&s;elf: but I was at la&s;t beat off the field by a journeyman &s;hoe-maker,
who fairly out-whined <PB N="522" REF="97"> me; and finding my&s;elf de&s;erted
by my u&s;ual audi|ence, I became Setter to a Fleet-par&s;on.</P>
<P>MY employment now was to take my &s;tand at the end of
<HI>Fleet-Market,</HI> and whenever I &s;aw any gaping young couple &s;taring
about them, to whi&s;per them &s;oftly in the ear, and a&s;k them whether they
wanted to be married; a&s;&s;uring them withal, that ours was the only
marriage-booth in the fair. Whenever the ceremony was performed, I officiated
as clerk: and when my ma&s;ter the doctor died, I made a &s;hift to purcha&s;e
his entire &s;tock in trade, (con&s;i&s;ting of a ru&s;ty ca&s;&s;ock, an old

<P>_EATING and drinking being ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to keep our
crazy frames together, we are obliged to attend to the calls of na|ture, and
&s;atisfy the regular cravings of the appetite: Though it is, in truth, but a
very &s;mall part of the world, that eat becau&s;e they are hungry, or drink
becau&s;e they are dry. The common day-labourer may, indeed, be glad to
&s;natch an ha&s;ty meal with his wife and children, that he may have
&s;trength to return to his work; and the porter finds it nece&s;&s;ary to
refre&s;h him&s;elf with a full pot of entire butt, while he re&s;ts his load
upon the bulk at the ale-hou&s;e door: but tho&s;e, who have more lei&s;ure to
&s;tudy what they &s;hall eat and drink, require &s;ome|thing 
<PB N="524" REF="99"> more in their food, than what is barely whol&s;ome or
nece&s;&s;ary; their palates mu&s;t be gratified with rich &s;auces and
high-&s;ea&s;oned delicacies; and they frequently have re|cour&s;e to whetters
and provocatives, to anticipate the call of hunger, and to enable their
&s;tomachs to bear the load they lay on it. There are a &s;ort of men, who&s;e
chief pride is a good ta&s;te (as they call it) and a great &s;tomach: and the
whole bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives is included in their breakfa&s;t, dinner and
&s;upper. The&s;e people, of whatever rank and denomination, whether they
regale with turtle, or devour &s;houlders of mutton and peck-loaves for wagers,
whether a duke at <HI>White</HI>'s, or a chairman at the <HI>Blue-Po&s;ts,</HI>
are cer|tainly of the number of tho&s;e, 
<Q REND="inline">"whom nature, (as <HI>Sallu&s;t</HI> tells us,)
has made like the brutes, obedient to their bellies;"</Q> and, indeed, partake
in &s;ome mea&s;ure of the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed on the Serpent, 
<Q REND="inline">"to be cur&s;ed <HI>above</HI> all cattle, and
to go for ever on their bellies."</Q></P>
<P>THERE are many follies and vices, which men endeavour to hide
from the re&s;t of the world: but this, above all others, they take a pride in
proclaiming; and &s;eem to run about with the cap and bells, as if they were
ambitious to be ranked among the Sons of Folly. Indeed, as the politene&s;s of
the <HI>French</HI> language has di&s;tingui&s;hed every glutton by the title
of <HI>Bon Vivant,</HI> and the courte&s;y of our own has honoured their
bea&s;tly gluttony by the name of <HI>Good Living,</HI> the epi|cure thinks to
eat and drink him&s;elf into your good opinion, and recommend him&s;elf to your
e&s;teem by an exqui&s;ite bill of fare. However this may be, it is remarkable,
that as the fox-hunter takes delight in relating the incidents of the chace,
and kills the fox again over a bowl of punch at night, &s;o the <HI>Bon
Vivant</HI> enjoys giving an account of a de|licious <PB N="525" REF="100">
dinner, and chews the cud of reflection on &s;uch ex|qui&s;ite
entertainment.</P>
<P>I HAVE been led into the&s;e thoughts by an acquaintance which I
have lately made with a per&s;on, who&s;e whole con|ver&s;ation is, litterally
&s;peaking, <HI>Table-Talk.</HI> His brain &s;eems to be &s;tuffed with an
hodge-podge of ideas, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal di&s;hes, which he is
perpetually &s;erving up for the en|terainment of the company. As it was &s;aid
of <HI>Longinus,</HI> that he was a Walking Library, in the &s;ame manner I
con|&s;ider this gentleman as a Walking Larder: and as the ora|tions of
<HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> were &s;aid to &s;mell of the lamp, &s;o my friend's
whole conver&s;ation &s;avours of the kitchen. He even makes u&s;e of his
&s;tomach as an artificial memory; and recol|lects every place he has been at,
and every per&s;on he has &s;een, by &s;ome circum&s;tances relating to the
entertainment he met with. If he calls to mind any inn, he adds, 
<Q REND="inline">"for there the cook &s;poiled a fine
turbot:"</Q> another hou&s;e is recollected, 
<Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e the par&s;on took all the fat of the
haunch of veni&s;on:"</Q> he remembers a gentleman you mention, 
<Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e he had the &s;malle&s;t &s;tomach he
ever knew;"</Q> or one lady, 
<Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e &s;he drank a great deal of wine at
&s;upper;"</Q> and another, 
<Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e &s;he has the be&s;t receipt for
making her pickled cu|cumbers look green."</Q></P>
<P>HIS pa&s;&s;ion for eating al&s;o influences all his actions,
diver&s;ions, and &s;tudies. He is fond of hare-hunting, as he &s;ays his
per&s;uit is animated by the hopes of &s;eeing pu&s;s &s;moking on the table;
but he wonders how any man can venture his neck in a chace after a fox, which,
when it is got, is not worth eating. He has had occa&s;ion to vi&s;it the 
<PB N="526" REF="101"> &s;everal Wells in this kingdom, which he con&s;iders,
not as places where per&s;ons go to drink the waters, but where they go to eat;
and in this light he gives a character of them all. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Bath,</HI> &s;ays he, is one of the be&s;t
markets in the world: At <HI>Tunbridge</HI> you have fine mutton, and mo&s;t
exqui&s;ite wheat-ears: But at <HI>Cheltenham,</HI> pox take the place, you
have nothing but cow-beef, red veal, and white bacon."</Q> He looks upon every
part of <HI>England</HI> in the &s;ame light; and would as &s;oon go to
<HI>Che&s;hire</HI> for butter, and <HI>Suffolk</HI> for chee&s;e, as mi&s;s
eating what each particular town or county is famous for having the mo&s;t
excellent in its kind. He does not grudge to ride twenty miles to dine on a
favourite di&s;h; and it was but la&s;t week, that he appointed a friend in
<HI>Buckingham&s;hire</HI> to meet him at <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"which (&s;ays he in his letter) is the be&s;t
place we can &s;ettle our bu&s;ine&s;s at, on account of tho&s;e excellent
rolls we may have for breakfa&s;t, and the delicious trout we are &s;ure to
have at dinner."</Q></P>
<P>MR. CRAMWELL (for that is his name) is &s;o unfortunate as to
want a pur&s;e adequate to his ta&s;te; &s;o that he is put to &s;everal
&s;hifts, and obliged to have recour&s;e to &s;everal arti|fices, to gratify
his appetite. For this purpo&s;e he has with great pains con&s;tituted a Club,
con&s;i&s;ting of per&s;ons mo&s;t likely to promote Good Living. This Society
is compo&s;ed of members, who are all of them of &s;ome trade that can
furni&s;h it with provi&s;ions, (except one country &s;quire, who &s;upplies it
with game,) and they are obliged to &s;end in the be&s;t of whatever their
trade deals in, at prime co&s;t: by which wi&s;e management the Club is
&s;upplied with every delicacy the &s;ea&s;ons affords, at the mo&s;t
rea&s;onable rates. Upon any vacancy much care and deliberation is u&s;ed in 
<PB N="527" REF="102"> electing a new member. A candidate's being able to
de|vour a whole turkey with an equal proportion of chine, or eat one haunch of
veni&s;on with the fat of another as &s;auce to it, would be no recommendation:
On the contrary; there was never more caution u&s;ed, at the death of a Pope,
to elect a &s;ucce&s;&s;or who appears the mo&s;t likely to be &s;hort-lived,
than by this Society of <HI>Epicurean</HI> Hogs to admit nobody of a &s;tomach
&s;uperior to their own. Mr. CRAMWELL, on account of his extraordinary
profici|ency in the Science of Eating, is honoured with the office of Caterer;
and has arrived to &s;uch a pitch of accuracy in the calculation of what is
&s;ufficient, that he &s;eems to gage the &s;tomachs of the Club, as an
Exci&s;eman does a ca&s;k: and when all the members are pre&s;ent, they
&s;eldom &s;end away three ounces of meat from the table. A Captain of a &s;hip
trading to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> has been admitted an hono|rary member,
having contracted to bring over as a pre&s;ent to them a &s;ufficient cargo of
turtle every voyage; and a few days ago I met CRAMWELL in prodigious high
&s;pirits, when he told me, that he was the happie&s;t man in the world: 
<Q REND="inline">"for now, &s;ays he, we &s;hall have Ortolans as
plenty as pidgeons; for it was but ye&s;terday, that we balloted into our
&s;ociety one of the <HI>Flanderkin-Bird-Merchants.</HI>"</Q> This
a&s;&s;ociation for the pre&s;ervation of elegant fare gratifies my friend
CRAMWELL's luxury at a cheap rate: and that he may make as many good meals as
po&s;&s;ible, he often con|trives to introduce him&s;elf to the tables of
per&s;ons of quality. This he effects by &s;ending my lord or her lady&s;hip a
pre&s;ent of a <HI>Bath Chee&s;e,</HI> a <HI>Ruff</HI> or <HI>Land-Rail</HI>
from his friends in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> or <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI>
which &s;eldom fails to procure him an invitation to dinner. It once happened,
that dining <PB N="528" REF="103"> with an Alderman his appetite got the better
of his good-breeding, when he &s;haved off all the out&s;ide of a
plumb-pudding; and he has ever &s;ince been talked of in the city by the name
of SKIN-PUDDING.</P>
<P>AS all his joy and mi&s;ery con&s;tantly ari&s;es from his
belly, he thinks it is the &s;ame with others; and I heard him a&s;k a perfect
&s;tranger to him, who complained that he was &s;ick, whether he had over-eat
him&s;elf. It is no wonder, that CRAMWELL &s;hould be &s;ometimes troubled with
the gout: I called upon him the other morning, and found him with his legs
wrapped up in flannel, and a book lying open before him upon the table. On
a&s;king him what he was reading, he told me he was <HI>taking phy&s;ic</HI>;
and on enquiring who&s;e advice he had, 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh, &s;ays he, nobody can do me &s;o much good
as Mrs. <HI>Hannah Gla&s;&s;e.</HI> I am here going through a cour&s;e of her
<HI>Art of Cookery,</HI> in hopes to get a &s;tomach: for indeed, my dear
friend, (added he, with tears in his eyes) my appetite is quite gone; and I am
&s;ure I &s;hall die, if I do not find &s;omething in this book, which I think
I can eat."</Q></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P>_HORACE, in the pa&s;&s;age quoted at the head of my paper,
tells us (after <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>) of a man, who u&s;ed to &s;it in the
empty theatre, and fancy that he &s;aw real exhi|bitions on the &s;tage. We
have the like account in another ancient author, of a per&s;on that u&s;ed to
wait with great &s;ollicitude the coming in of &s;hips into 
<PB N="530" REF="105"> the harbour, believing them to be his own property. The
end of the&s;e madmen was al&s;o &s;imilar: they were both cured; and both
complained, that they were deprived of the &s;atisfaction which they before
enjoyed from a plea&s;ing error of their minds.</P>
<P>THAT the happine&s;s and mi&s;ery of the far greate&s;t part of
mankind depends upon the fancy, need not be in&s;i&s;ted on: <HI>Crede
qu&ograve;d habes et babes,</HI> Think that you have and you have, is a maxim
not confined to tho&s;e only within the walls of <HI>Bedlam.</HI> I remember an
humouri&s;t, who would fre|quently divert him&s;elf in the &s;ame manner with
the mad|men above-mentioned, and &s;upply his real wants by the force of his
imagination. He would go round the markets, and &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf to be
cheapening the mo&s;t dainty provi&s;ions; and when he came home to his
&s;canty meal, by the &s;ame ideal contrivance he would convert his trotters
into turbot, and his &s;mall beer into the mo&s;t delicious Burgundy. As he was
a barber by trade, he would put on the air and manners of his cu&s;tomers,
while he combed out their wigs: with every bag he would conceive him&s;elf
going to court or a ridotto; and once, when he was &s;ick, he got together
three or four of the large&s;t tyes, placed them upon blocks round his
bed-&s;ide, and called them a con&s;ultation of phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>BUT of all others, there are none perhaps, who are more obliged
to the imagination for their ideal happine&s;s, than the fraternity of which I
am an unworthy member. There is no &s;et of people, who are more ambitious to
appear grand in the world, and yet have le&s;s means, than tho&s;e gentlemen
whom the world has &s;tiled Authors. Wit and pride as often 
<PB N="531" REF="106"> go hand in hand together as wit and poverty: but though
the generality of writers are by the frowns of fortune de|barred from
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a profu&s;e &s;hare of the good things of this world, they
are abundantly recompenced by enjoying them in &s;peculation. They indulge in
golden dreams, at the time that they have not &s;ixpence in their pockets, and
conjure up all the luxuries of <HI>Pontac</HI>'s before them, though they are
at a lo&s;s perhaps where to get a dinner. Thus a Critic by a kind of magic
will tran&s;port him&s;elf to the thea|tres in an imaginary gilt chariot, and
be &s;eated at once in the front-boxes; when in reality he has waited for two
hours in <HI>Vinegar-Yard</HI> before the opening of the doors, to &s;ecure to
him&s;elf a corner in the twelve-penny gallery. Hence it al&s;o happens to
mo&s;t Authors, that though their way of life be ever &s;o mean, their writings
favour of the mo&s;t unbounded magnificence; and as they have nothing to
be&s;tow, a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing genero&s;ity always accompanies every action
of the quill. Thus a Novelli&s;t, for example, is remarkably lavi&s;h of his
ca&s;h on all occa&s;ions; and &s;pares no expence in carrying on the de&s;igns
of his per&s;onages through ever &s;o many volumes. Nothing, indeed, is more
ea&s;y than to be very profu&s;e upon paper: An author, when he is about it,
may erect his airy ca&s;tles to what height he plea&s;es, and with a wave of
his pen may command the mines of <HI>Peru:</HI> and as he deals about his money
without once untying his pur&s;e-&s;trings, it will co&s;t him the &s;ame
whether he throws away a mite or a million; and another dip of ink, by the
addition of two or three <HI>gratis</HI> cyphers, may in an in&s;tant convert a
&s;ingle ten into as many thou|&s;ands. We mu&s;t not therefore be
&s;urpri&s;ed, that the heroes of our modern novels &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s the
Pur&s;e of <HI>Fortu|natus,</HI> <PB N="532" REF="107"> as their writers have
all of them the power of his Wi&s;hing-cap.</P>
<P>BUT it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that we E&s;&s;ay-writers, as we
are the greate&s;t <HI>Egoti&s;ts,</HI> are con&s;equently mo&s;t vain and
o&s;tentatious. As we frequently find occa&s;ion to prate about our&s;elves, we
take abundant care to put the reader con|&s;tantly in mind of our importance.
It is very well known, that we keep the be&s;t company, are pre&s;ent at the
mo&s;t expen&s;ive places of diver&s;ion, and can talk as familiarly of
<HI>White</HI>'s, as if we had been admitted to the honour of lo|&s;ing an
e&s;tate there. Though the nece&s;&s;aries as well as the luxuries of life may
perhaps be denied us, we readily make up for the want of them by the creative
power of the imagination. Thus, for in&s;tance, I remember a bro|ther
E&s;&s;ayi&s;t, who took a particular pride in dating his lu|cubrations,
<HI>From my own Apartment</HI>; which he repre&s;ented as abounding with every
convenience: though at the &s;ame time he was working three &s;tories from the
ground, and was often forced to &s;cribble upon wrappers of tobacco for want of
other paper. As to my&s;elf, I make no doubt but the reader has long ago
di&s;covered without my telling him, that I loll at my ea&s;e in a crim&s;on
velvet chair, re&s;t my elbow on the poli&s;hed &s;urface of a mahogany table,
write my e&s;&s;ays upon gilt paper, and dip my pen into a &s;ilver
&s;tandi&s;h.</P>
<P>Indeed, though I have taken upon me the Title of a CONNOISSEUR,
I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to boa&s;t, that I am po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a
<HI>Mu&s;aeum</HI> like <HI>Sloane</HI>'s, or a Library equal to
<HI>Mead</HI>'s. But as <HI>Pliny,</HI> and after him our countryman Mr.
<HI>Pope,</HI> have left us a de&s;cription of their elegant <HI>Villa,</HI> I
hope <PB N="533" REF="108"> it will not be thought arrogance in me (after what
I have &s;aid,) if I &s;et before the reader an account of my own STUDY. This
is a little edifice &s;ituated at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the re&s;t of the
hou&s;e, for the &s;ake of privacy and re|tirement. It is an ancient pile of
building, and hangs over a &s;mall rivulet, which runs underneath it; and as
the entrance into it is &s;haded by a thick hedge of ever-greens, which ca&s;t
a kind of awful gloom about it, &s;ome learned antiquarians have been led to
conjecture, that it was formerly a Temple (or rather Chapel of Ea&s;e,)
dedicated to one of the heathen Godde&s;&s;es. This Godde&s;s, they inform me,
was wor&s;hipped by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and was probably held in no le&s;s
veneration by the <HI>Aegyptians, Chaldees, Syrians,</HI> and other nations.
However this be, the walls on the in&s;ide are deco|rated with various
in&s;criptions alluding to the religious rites performed there, and hung round
with the rude rhymes of ancient bards.</P>
<P>TO this STUDY I retire con&s;tantly every morning after
breakfa&s;t, and at other parts of the day, as occa&s;ions call. Here I am at
liberty to indulge my meditations unin|terrupted, as I &s;uffer no one to break
in upon my privacy; and (what will perhaps &s;urpri&s;e my readers) I find in
my&s;elf the greate&s;t inclination to vi&s;it it after an hearty meal. In this
place I have made a very rapid progre&s;s in literature, and have gone through
&s;everal very learned volumes, which otherwi&s;e I &s;hould never have looked
into. I have here travelled leaf by leaf through the works of many worthy, but
neglected ancient divines, critics, and politicians; and have turned over many
a modern pamphlet or poem with equal &s;atisfaction. I mu&s;t not forget to
mention, that (like the &s;crupulous <HI>Mahometans)</HI> I have often picked
up the <PB N="534" REF="109"> fragments of &s;everal learned writers, which
have come from the chandlers, and lodged them, among others no le&s;s
valu|able, in my STUDY.</P>
<P>I MAY &s;afely boa&s;t, that I am indebted for many of my be&s;t
thoughts in the cour&s;e of the&s;e papers to the reflections I have had the
lei&s;ure to make in this STUDY; which pro|bably has the &s;ame influence on my
mind, as the &s;tew'd prunes, which <HI>Bayes</HI> tells us he always took when
he wrote. But if my STUDY &s;erves to in&s;pire me &s;ometimes with agre|eable
ideas, it never fails on the other hand to remind me of the mortality of
writers; as it affords repeated proofs, that we may ju&s;tly &s;ay of our
works, as well as of our&s;elves,

<P>_GOING the other day to vi&s;it Mrs. <HI>Penelope Doat,</HI>
after I had waited &s;ome time in the parlour, the maid returned with her

with a grey parrot perched on one arm of the &s;ettee where &s;he &s;at, a
monkey on the back, and a tabby cat with half a dozen kittens in the other
corner. The whole room, which was a very large one, was indeed a Nur&s;ery for
all kinds of animals, except tho&s;e of the human &s;pecies: It was hung every
where with cages, containing parrots, mackaws, ca|nary birds, nightingales,
linnets, goldfinches, &amp;c. on the chairs were &s;everal cats repo&s;ing on
&s;oft cu&s;hions; and there were little kennels, in the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>
ta&s;te, in almo&s;t every corner of the room, filled with Pugs, Fidos, and
King <HI>Charles</HI>'s breed. As &s;oon as the chattering of the birds, the
barking of the dogs, and the mewing of the cats, which my entrance
oc|ca&s;ioned, began to cea&s;e, 
<Q REND="inline">"You find me here, Sir, (&s;aid the lady)
tending my little family, the only joy of my life: Here's a dear pretty
creature (holding up the dog &s;he was combing) a beauty! &s;ir, a fine
long-eared &s;nub-no&s;ed beauty! Lady <HI>Faddle</HI> adverti&s;ed three
quarters of a year, and cold not get the fellow to it. Ah, ble&s;s it, and love
it, &s;weet &s;oul!"</Q>&mdash;And then &s;he &s;troaked it, and ki&s;&s;ed it
for near two minutes, uttering the whole time all tho&s;e inarticulate
&s;ounds, which cannot be committed to paper, and which are only addre&s;&s;ed
to Dogs, Cats, and Children, and may be &s;tiled the language of the Nur&s;ery.
Upon ob|&s;erving me &s;mile, at the embraces &s;he be&s;towed on her little
motley darling, 
<Q REND="inline">"I am afraid (&s;aid &s;he) you don't love
the&s;e pretty creatures. How can you be &s;o cruel? Poor <HI>dumb</HI> things!
I would not have them hurt for all the world: nor do I &s;ee why a lady
&s;hould not indulge her&s;elf in having &s;uch &s;weet little company about
her, as well as you men run out e&s;tates in keeping a pack of filthy 
<PB N="357" REF="112"> hounds."</Q> Then &s;he laid <HI>Pompey</HI> on his
cu&s;hion by the fire-&s;ide, and railed at the barbarity of the human
&s;pecies to the re&s;t of the creation, and entered into a long
di&s;&s;ertation on tenderne&s;s and humanity.</P>
<P>A HUMANE di&s;po&s;ition is, indeed &s;o amiable either in man
or woman, that it ought always to be cheri&s;hed and kept alive in our
bo&s;oms; but at the &s;ame time we &s;hould be cautious not to render the
fir&s;t virtue of our nature ridi|culous. The mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate temper
may be &s;ufficiently gratified by relieving the wretches of our own &s;pecies:
but who would ever boa&s;t of their genero&s;ity to a lap-dog, and their
conferring eternal obligations on a monkey? or would any per&s;on de&s;erve to
be celebrated for their charity, who &s;hould deny &s;upport to a relation or a
friend, becau&s;e he maintains a litter of kittens? For my part, before I would
treat a <HI>Dutch</HI> puppy with &s;uch ab&s;urd fondne&s;s, I mu&s;t be
brought to wor&s;hip dogs, as the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> did of old; and e'er I
would &s;o extravagantly doat upon a monkey, I would (as <HI>Iago</HI> &s;ays
on a different occa&s;ion) 
<Q REND="inline">"change my huma|nity with a baboon."</Q></P>
<P>YET there have been many in&s;tances, be&s;ides my female
friend, of this fondne&s;s for the brute creation being carried to very
ridiculous lengths. The grave doctors of the faculty have been called in to
feel the pul&s;e of a lap-dog, and in&s;pect the urine of a &s;quirrel: nay, I
am my&s;elf acquainted with a lady, who carried this matter &s;o far, as to
di&s;charge her chaplain, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to bury her monkey. But the
mo&s;t &s;olemn piece of mummery on the&s;e occa&s;ions is the making
provi&s;ions for the&s;e animals by will; which ab&s;urd legacies as little
de&s;erve the title of humanity, as tho&s;e people <PB N="538" REF="113"> merit
being called charitable, who in a death-bed fright &s;tarve their relations, by
leaving their e&s;tates to found an ho&s;|pital. It were indeed to be wi&s;hed,
that money left in tru&s;t for &s;uch u&s;es were &s;ubject to &s;ome &s;tatute
of <HI>Mortmain</HI>; or at lea&s;t that the gentlemen of the long robe, would
contrive &s;ome &s;cheme to cut off the entail from Monkeys, Mackaws,
<HI>Italian</HI> Greyhounds, and Tabby Cats.</P>
<P>THAT a &s;tage coachman &s;hould love his cattle better than his
wife and children, or a country &s;quire be fond of his hounds and hunters, is
not &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, becau&s;e the rea&s;on of their regard for them is
ea&s;ily accounted for; and a &s;ea|captain has, upon the &s;ame principles,
been known to con|tract an affection for his &s;hip: but no coachman would,
like <HI>Caligula,</HI> tye his hor&s;es to a golden rack, but thinks he
&s;hews &s;ufficient kindne&s;s by filling them with good whole&s;ome
provender; and the country &s;port&s;man takes care to provide his hounds with
a good kennel and hor&s;e|fle&s;h, but would never think of placing them on
cu&s;hions before the fire, and feeding them with frica&s;ees, or breed them
with as much care as the heir to his e&s;tate. This irre|gular pa&s;&s;ion (if
I may &s;o call it) is mo&s;t frequently to be met with among the ladies. How
often has the &s;lighted gallant envied the care&s;&s;es given to a lap-dog, or
ki&s;&s;es be|&s;towed on a &s;quirrel! and 
<Q REND="inline">"I would I were thy bird!"</Q> has been the fond
exclamation of many a <HI>Romeo.</HI> But it is remarkable, that this affection
for birds and bea&s;ts generally wears off after marriage, and that the ladies
di&s;card their four-footed darlings and feathered favourites, when they can
be&s;tow their endearments on an hu&s;band. Wherefore, the&s;e dry nur&s;es to
Puggs and Grimalkins are mo&s;tly to be met with among tho&s;e females, who
have been di&s;appointed <PB N="539" REF="114"> in the affairs of love, and
have again&s;t their will retained the flower of virginity till it has withered
in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It often happens, that there is &s;ome kind of
analogy between the gallant they once loved, and the animal on which they
afterwards fix their affections: and I my&s;elf remember an in&s;tance of a
lady's pa&s;&s;ion for a lawyer being converted into dotage on a parrot; and
have an old maiden aunt, who once langui&s;hed for a beau, who&s;e heart is now
devoted to a monkey.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hould not &s;o much quarrel with the&s;e humane ladies,
who chu&s;e to &s;ettle their affections on the brute &s;pe|cies, if they were
not trouble&s;ome to others, who are not &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the charms of a
&s;nub no&s;e, or can di&s;cover any beauty in the grey eyes of a cat. A
doating mother would never forgive you, if you did not call her brat a fine
child, and dangle it about, and prattle with it, with as much &s;eeming rapture
as her&s;elf: and in like manner, a lady would take it as an affront to her own
per&s;on, if you did not pay your adre&s;&s;es equally to her pug or her
parroquet. I know a young fellow, that was cut off with a &s;hilling by an old
maiden aunt, becau&s;e he gave poor <HI>Veny</HI> a kick only for lifting up
his leg again&s;t the gentleman's &s;tocking: and I have heard of another, who
might have carried off a very rich widow, but that he could not prevail upon
him&s;elf to extend his care&s;&s;es to her dormou&s;e. Indeed, I cannot help
thinking, that the embraces and endearments be&s;towed on the&s;e rivals of the
human &s;pecies &s;hould be as private as the mo&s;t &s;ecret intrigues; and I
would have lap-dogs, like fretful and &s;qualling children, confined to bark
and growl only in the Nur&s;ery. We may often &s;ee a footman following his
lady to church with a common prayer-book under one arm <PB N="540" REF="115"> a
dog under the other: I have al&s;o known a grave divine forced to &s;top
&s;hort in the middle of a prayer, while the whole congregation has been
rai&s;ed from their knees to attend to the howling of a lap-dog: and I once
&s;aw a tragedy monarch di&s;turbed in his la&s;t moments, as he lay expiring
on the car|pet, by a little black dog of king <HI>Charles</HI>'s breed, who
jumped out of the &s;tage-box, and &s;eizing upon the hero's perriwig, brought
it off in his mouth, and lodged it in his lady's lap.</P>
<P>IT will not appear &s;trange, after what has been &s;aid, that
the&s;e ladies (or lady-like gentlemen) &s;hould be as &s;ollicitous to
pre&s;erve the breed of their favourite animals, as a &s;port&s;|man of his
hounds and hor&s;es. I have known a gentleman in St. <HI>James</HI>'s &s;treet
&s;end his little <HI>Cupid</HI> in a &s;edan chair as far as
<HI>Gro&s;venor</HI> &s;quare to wait upon a lady's <HI>Veny</HI> for this very
purpo&s;e: and I &s;hall never forget a Card, which was &s;ent to another lady
on a like occa&s;ion, expre&s;&s;ed in the fol|lowing terms.&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"Mr. &mdash;'s compliments to Lady <HI>Betty
&mdash;,</HI> is glad to hear Mi&s;s <HI>Chloe</HI> is &s;afely delivered, and
begs it as a particular favour, that her lady&s;hip would be plea&s;ed to SET
HIM DOWN FOR A PUPPY."</Q></P>

<P>_IF we con&s;ider that part of our acquaintance, whom we
remember from their infancy, we &s;hall find, that the expectations we once
en|tertained of their future abilities are in many in&s;tances di&s;appointed.
Tho&s;e, who were accounted heavy dull boys, have by diligence and application
made their way to the fir&s;t honours, and become eminent for their learning
and knowledge of the world; while others who were regarded as bright lads, and
imagined to po&s;&s;e&s;s parts equal to any &s;cheme of life, have turned out
di&s;&s;olute and ignorant; and quite unworthy the title of a Genius, except in
the modern acceptation of the word, by which <PB N="542" REF="117"> it
&s;ignifies a very &s;illy young fellow, who from his extrava|gance and
debauchery has obtained the name of a Genius, (like <HI>lucus a non
lucendo)</HI> becau&s;e he has no Genius at all.</P>
<P>IT is a &s;hocking draw-back from a father's happine&s;s, when
he &s;ees his &s;on ble&s;&s;ed with &s;trong natural parts and quick
conception, to reflect that the&s;e very talents may be his ruin. If vanity
once gets into his head and gives it a wrong turn, the young coxcomb will
neglect the means of improvement, tru&s;t entirely to his native abilities, and
be as ridiculou&s;ly proud of his parts, as the brats of quality are taught to
be of their family. In the mean time tho&s;e, whom nature threw far behind him,
are by application enabled to leave him at a di&s;tance in their turn; and he
continues boa&s;ting of his Genius, till it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts no longer, but dies
for want of cultivation. Thus vanity and indolence prevents his improvement,
and if he is to ri&s;e in the world by his merit, takes away the means of
&s;ucce&s;s, and perhaps reduces him to very mi&s;erable di&s;tre&s;&s;es. I
know one of the&s;e early Geniu&s;es, who &s;carce &s;upports him&s;elf by
writing for a book&s;eller; and another, who is at lei&s;ure to contem|plate
his extraordinary parts in the Fleet-pri&s;on.</P>
<P>IF we look into the world, we &s;hall find that the mere Genius
will never rai&s;e him&s;elf to any degree of eminence without a clo&s;e and
unwearied application to his re&s;pective bu&s;ine&s;s or profe&s;&s;ion. The
Inns of Court are full of the&s;e men of parts, who cannot bear the drudgery of
turning over dry Ca&s;es and Reports; but, though they appear ever &s;o
eloquent in taverns and coffee-hou&s;es, not the neare&s;t relation will
tru&s;t them with a Brief: And many a &s;prightly phy&s;ician has walked on
foot all his life, with no more <PB N="543" REF="118"> knowledge of his
profe&s;&s;ion than what lies in his perriwig. For whatever opinion they
them&s;elves may have of their own parts, other per&s;ons do not chu&s;e to be
bantered out of their e&s;tates, or joked out of their lives: And even in
trade, the plodding men of the Alley would foretell the bankruptcy of any wit
among them, who &s;hould laugh at the labour of Accounts, or de&s;pi&s;e the
<HI>Italian</HI> Method of Book-keeping. Thus we &s;ee, that parts alone are
not &s;uf|ficient to recommend us to the good opinion of the world: and even
the&s;e, if not rou&s;ed and called forth by &s;tudy and application, would
become torpid and u&s;ele&s;s: as the race|hor&s;e, though not put to drag a
dray or carry a pack, mu&s;t yet be kept in exerci&s;e. But I &s;hall enlarge
no further on this &s;ubject, as I would not anticipate the thoughts con|tained
in the following elegant little Fable; which (as my corre&s;pondent informs me)
is written by the &s;ame ingenious hand, that obliged the public with the

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE explanation which you gave us &s;ome time ago of GOOD
COMPANY, has led me to con&s;ider the import and extent of the epithet GOOD;
which, in the modern &s;en&s;e of the word, is indi&s;crimi|nately applied to
things very bad in their nature, and is &s;ometimes u&s;ed only as a term of
reproach.</P>
<P><PB N="548" REF="123">To begin, fir&s;t, with what is called a
GOOD MAN. By this, one would imagine, &s;hould be under&s;tood an hone&s;t,
virtuous, and religious per&s;on: but to look for a GOOD MAN, in this &s;trict
acceptation of the phra&s;e, among the men of fa&s;hion, would be as vain a
&s;earch as that of <HI>Diogenes</HI> with his lanthorn in open day-light. This
appellation is, indeed, very familiarly u&s;ed among the gentlemen of
<HI>'Change Alley:</HI> but there it is meant only to &s;ignify a <HI>Rich</HI>
man. He is there called a GOOD MAN, who is able to an&s;wer a bill at &s;ight,
though he is known to be ever &s;o great a cheat. So by the &s;ame
unaccountable phra&s;eology, a &s;coundrel with a large e&s;tate is entitled a
<HI>Man of Worth</HI>: as among rakes the HONEST fellow may be the mo&s;t
abandoned debauchee and great|e&s;t villain upon earth.</P>
<P>BY the &s;ame figure, the GOOD FELLOW is he, who at a Country
Wake can &s;oil the be&s;t wre&s;tler, break mo&s;t heads, and challenge the
ring; take <HI>Broughton</HI> by the no&s;e; bid defiance to the
<HI>Clare-Market</HI> butchers; knock down the con&s;tables and watch, in
beating the rounds in <HI>Covent-Garden</HI>; bilk the waiter, and kick the
bully out of doors in the hundreds of <HI>Drury</HI>; carry off his &s;ix
bottles of port at a &s;itting; or drink October, till he leaves the country
&s;quire and the par&s;on on the floor.</P>
<P>AS to the other &s;ex, the term GOOD WOMAN is applied, as a
mere expletive without any meaning, to the poor only, or perhaps to get rid of
the importunity of a beggar. In the country, indeed, a GOOD LADY is &s;ometimes
mentioned with a &s;neer or as a term of reproach; and means one, who is &s;o
old-fa&s;hioned, as to go to church, &s;ay her prayers, <PB N="549" REF="124">
and convert her dre&s;&s;ing room into an apothecary's &s;hop. But I would
a&s;k any well-bred lady, if &s;he would be content to bani&s;h her&s;elf from
the delights of the theatre, opera|hou&s;e, ma&s;querades, routs, drums,
a&s;&s;emblies, and the dear card-table, to be confined to the country, have
prayers in her own hou&s;e twice a day, and do charitable offices to her poor
neighbours, merely to acquire the ridiculous reputation of a GOOD LADY.</P>
<P>I SHALL proceed next to con&s;ider what is generally
under|&s;tood by a GOOD EDUCATION. This is not to be found in either of our
Univer&s;ities: nor is any learning or know|ledge implied in it, except what is
called the <HI>Knowledge of the World,</HI> which cannot be attained among
pedants, or gathered from mu&s;ty books. Common lads may be la&s;hed through a
grammar-&s;chool, and afterwards locked up in colleges: but young fellows of
ta&s;te and &s;pirit have better opportunities of improving them&s;elves by
mixing with the town and the <HI>beau monde.</HI> For this rea&s;on they are
intro|duced very early into tho&s;e excellent Seminaries of GOOD EDUCATION
about <HI>Covent Garden,</HI> and placed under the tuition of <HI>Haddock,
Dougla&s;s, Harris,</HI> &amp;c. It is al&s;o nece&s;|&s;ary, to ground them in
the genteel principles of infidelity and free-thinking, that they &s;hould
attend the di&s;putations at the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> and the lectures of the
<HI>Clare-market</HI> Orator: and it would not be ami&s;s, if they were to get
a little notion of the modern Art of Critici&s;m by frequenting the
<HI>Bedford</HI> and <HI>George</HI>'s coffee-hou&s;es. After this it is
proper, to compleat their education, that they &s;hould make the tour of
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI>; which will not fail to in&s;pire them with
the laudable love of every thing that is foreign, and a thorough contempt for
their own country. <PB N="550" REF="125"> Nothing now remains but to in&s;truct
them in the noble Science of Gaming; for which purpo&s;e it has been found
expedient to con&s;titute an Academy at <HI>White</HI>'s; where it is taught in
all it's branches. The con&s;equences of &s;uch a GOOD EDUCATION, as is here
&s;et down, may be &s;een in many in&s;tances: Some have been enabled by it to
ruin their con&s;titutions, and others to run out their e&s;tates. Some have
received the fini&s;hing &s;troke of a GOOD EDU|CATION at <HI>Tyburn,</HI>
while others have given &s;ufficient proofs of it by being gallantly run
through the body in a duel, or genteelly &s;hooting them&s;elves through the
head.</P>
<P>LET us now take a view of the GOOD EDUCATION, which is at
pre&s;ent in vogue among the fair &s;ex. As the GOOD LADIES of former days were
de&s;irous, that their daughters &s;hould make GOOD WIVES, they thought the
fir&s;t &s;tep towards it was to make them GOOD HOUSE|WIVES. They therefore
bred them up in the dome&s;tic arts of pickling, pre&s;erving, di&s;tilling
&s;imple waters, and the like: they al&s;o taught them to work at their needle,
write, ca&s;t accounts, and read a chapter in the Bible or &s;ome other Good
BOOK, as they are ridiculou&s;ly oalled. But this method of education has been
found to be fit only for low girls de&s;igned to go to &s;ervice, or poor
par&s;ons daugh|ters that mu&s;t come to be milliners, or &s;omething wor&s;e.
As to ladies of fa&s;hion, to learn <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would only ob&s;truct
their advancement in the <HI>French</HI> language, which they are taught to
<HI>&s;peak</HI> from their infancy, but never to read: be&s;ides, they will
get a better knowledge of their mother tongue from the peculiar dialects u&s;ed
at routes and a&s;&s;em|blies, and the &s;pirited conver&s;ations carried on at
ma&s;querades and other public places, than they could po&s;&s;ibly do from 
<PB N="551" REF="126"> books. All the writing required is to be able to
&s;crawl out a billet-doux; for which we mu&s;t al&s;o own, that
&s;pelling-books are of no &s;ervice: and working we know would hurt their eyes
no le&s;s than reading: As to religion, honour, virtue, charity, and the like
old-fa&s;hioned cant, nobody would think of &s;tuffing any girl's head with it,
above the degree of a chambermaid.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent notion of a GOOD Education was, there|fore,
unknown to the females of former ages; as, be&s;ides the u&s;ual
accompli&s;hments of dancing, or the like, it will be found to con&s;i&s;t in
the knowledge of Intriguing, Dre&s;s, and (I may add too) the Card-table. In
the fir&s;t of the&s;e particulars they con&s;tantly receive le&s;&s;ons from
the milli|ners, mantua-makers, and maid-&s;ervants; and by being carried about
to all public places of diver&s;ion, they &s;oon become proficients in the
&s;ciences. The &s;ame tutors like|wi&s;e take care to in&s;truct their young
pupils in the Art of Dre&s;s; and I have known a little mi&s;s, by the time
&s;he was arrived at her teens, &s;o nice an adept in face-painting, as to
apply the <HI>rouge</HI> to her pretty cheeks with as much elegance and
propriety as her mamma. To conclude, when a young lady has got <HI>Hoyle</HI>'s
rules by heart, and is qua|lified to play a rubbers at a Sunday route, it is a
&s;ure mark of her having had a compleat GOOD EDUCATION.</P>
<P>THERE are many other in&s;tances, in which this word GOOD is
perverted to a very prepo&s;terous &s;en&s;e. Thus GOOD LIVING is made to
&s;ignify the practice of no other excellence, but what con&s;i&s;ts in Good
Eating and Drinking: but as you have formerly given us the character of one of
the&s;e GOOD LIVERS, I &s;hall only take notice, that the ill 
<PB N="552" REF="127"> humours con&s;equent of their luxury and intemperance,
which &s;hew them&s;elves in blotches and breakings out on their faces, are
emphatically called their <HI>Goodne&s;s.</HI> In like manner, by GOOD BLOOD we
are taught to under&s;tand a gentility of birth: and though a nobleman be ever
&s;o noto|rious for his vices, or though his ance&s;tors have been rai&s;ed by
the vile&s;t means, his po&s;terity always pride them&s;elves on the GOOD BLOOD
of the family. I would not be thought to quibble about words, when I ob&s;erve,
that the mo&s;t &s;hocking and bla&s;phemous ridicule on the &s;acred tenets of
our religion (though without the lea&s;t &s;hadow of wit) is by the pre&s;ent
&s;hallow race of free-thinkers applauded as a GOOD JOKE. The mo&s;t cruel and
unmanly actions are by our Bucks and Bloods &s;et down under the &s;ame
denomination: and if bla&s;phemy and profanene&s;s is a GOOD JOKE, a rape or a
murder is upon the &s;ame pinciples e&s;teemed a very GOOD THING.</P>

<P>_DRINKING is one of tho&s;e popular vices, which mo&s;t people
reckon among their venial failings, and it is thought no great blot on a man's
character, to &s;ay he takes his gla&s;s rather too freely. But as tho&s;e
vices are mo&s;t dangerous and likely to prevail, which if not approved are at
lea&s;t excu&s;ed by mo&s;t people, I have been tempted to examine, whether
Drinking really de&s;erves that quarter it receives from the generality of
mankind: and I <PB N="554" REF="129"> mu&s;t own, that after a &s;trict
attention to the principal mo|tives that induce men to become hard-drinkers, as
well as to the con&s;equences which &s;uch exce&s;&s;es produce, I am at a
lo&s;s to account for the received maxim that 
<Q REND="inline">"in good wine there is truth;"</Q> and &s;hould
no more expect happine&s;s in a full bowl, than cha&s;tity in the bar of a
tavern.</P>
<P>THE incentives to this practice are &s;ome of them very
&s;hocking, and &s;ome very ridiculous; as will perhaps appear from the
following characters. Poor <HI>Heartly</HI> was ble&s;t with every noble
qualification of the head and heart, and bade fair for the love and admiration
of the world, but was unfortunately bound in a very large &s;um for a friend,
who di&s;appeared, and left him to the mercy of the law. The di&s;tre&s;&s;es,
thus brought upon him by the treachery of another, threw him into the deepe&s;t
de&s;pair, and he had at la&s;t re|cour&s;e to drinking, to benumb (if
po&s;&s;ible) the very &s;en&s;e of reflection. He is mi&s;erable when &s;ober,
and when drunk &s;tupified and muddled: His misfortunes have robbed him of all
the joys of life, and he is now endeavouring wilfully to put an end to them by
a &s;low death.</P>
<P>TOM BUCK, from the fir&s;t day that he was put into breeches,
was always accounted a boy of &s;pirit: and before he reached the top of
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> &s;chool, knew the names and faces of the mo&s;t noted
girls upon town, to&s;&s;ed off his claret with a &s;mack, and had a long tick
at the ta|vern. When he went to <HI>Oxford,</HI> he e&s;pou&s;ed the Tory
party, becau&s;e they drank deepe&s;t; and he has for &s;ome years been
accounted a four-bottle man. He drank for fame, and has &s;o well
e&s;tabli&s;hed his character, that he was never known to &s;end a man from his
chambers &s;ober, but gene|rally laid his whole company under the table. Since
his <PB N="555" REF="130"> leaving the univer&s;ity, nobody ever acquired more
reputa|tion by Electioneering; for he can <HI>&s;ee out</HI> the &s;toute&s;t
free|holder in <HI>England</HI>: He has, indeed, &s;wallowed many a tun in the
&s;ervice of his country, and is now a &s;ounder pa|triot by two bottles than
any man in the county.</P>
<P>POOR <HI>Wou'd-be</HI> became a debauch&eacute;e through mere
ba&s;h|fulne&s;s, and a fooli&s;h &s;ort of mode&s;ty, that has made many a man
drunk in &s;pite of his teeth. He contracted an acquaintance with a &s;et of
hard drinkers, and though he would as &s;oon chu&s;e to &s;wallow a do&s;e of
phy&s;ic, has not courage to refu&s;e his bumper. He is drunk every night, and
always &s;ick to death the next morning, when he con|&s;tantly re&s;olves, to
drink nothing &s;tronger than &s;mall beer for the future; but at night the
poor fellow gets drunk again through downright mode&s;ty. Thus
<HI>Wou'd-be</HI> &s;uffers him&s;elf to be pre&s;t into the &s;ervice; and
&s;ince he has com|menced a jolly fellow is become one of the mo&s;t
mi&s;erable wretches upon earth.</P>
<P>HONEST <HI>Ned Brimmer</HI> is at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t di&s;mal
object that ever fell a &s;acrifice to liquor. It was unluckily his fir&s;t
ambition to promote what is u&s;ually called Good Fellow&s;hip: In this
undertaking he has in a very few years entirely ruined his con&s;titution, and
now &s;talks up and down in &s;o piteous a condition, as might in&s;pire his
companions with more melan|choly reflections than an empty bottle. He has quite
lo&s;t all appetite; and he is now obliged to keep up a weak arti|ficial heat
in his body, by the &s;ame means that de&s;troyed the natural warmth of his
con&s;titution. Rum, brandy, and u&s;|quebaugh are his diet-drinks, and he may
perhaps linger a few months, before he falls a martyr to Good Fellow&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="556" REF="131">HAVING thus taken a &s;hort view of the
unhappy mo|tives, that induce men to become hard-drinkers, few perhaps will
think &s;uch rea&s;ons any recommendation to Drunkenne&s;s: nor can I imagine
they will grow more fond of it, by ob|&s;erving what &s;trange creatures they
are during their intoxi|cation. <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> calls it 
<Q REND="inline">"putting a devil into their mouths to &s;teal
away their brains;"</Q> and indeed a cup too much turns a man the wrong &s;ide
out; and wine, at the &s;ame time it takes away the power of &s;tanding from
the legs, de|prives the mind of all &s;en&s;e and reflection. It is whim&s;ical
enough to con&s;ider the different effects, which wine produces on different
tempers. Sometimes, like love, it makes a fool &s;en&s;ible, and a wi&s;e man
an a&s;s; and &s;eems to imbibe a new quality from every different body, as
water takes a tincture from the ground it runs through.</P>
<P>HORACE has with great plea&s;antry recapitulated the various
effects of wine in a &s;tanza, which I have placed at the head of this paper.
One man grows maudlin and weeps; ano|ther becomes merry and facetious; a third
quarrels, throws a bottle at his companion's head, and could run his deare&s;t
friend through the body; a fourth is mad for a girl, and falls in love with a
&s;treet-walker, or an old woman roa&s;ting che&s;nuts; while to a fifth, the
liquor &s;erves as an opiate, and lulls him to &s;leep. <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>
has al&s;o &s;hewn this vari|ety of characters with great humour.
<HI>Ca&s;&s;io</HI> crys, 
<Q REND="inline">"let's to bu&s;ine&s;s,"</Q> and immediately
begins to hiccup out his prayers, and belches out his hopes of &s;alvation:
Ju&s;tice <HI>Silence,</HI> who does not &s;peak a word while he is &s;ober,
has no &s;ooner &s;wal|lowed the rouzing cup, than he roars out a catch, and
grows the noi&s;ie&s;t man in the company. It is reported to have been one of
the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite entertainments to the <PB N="557" REF="132"> choice
&s;pirits in the beginning of this century, to get <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> and
<HI>Steele</HI> together in company for the evening. <HI>Steele</HI>
enter|tained them till he was tip&s;y; when the &s;ame wine that &s;tu|pified
him, only &s;erved to elevate <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> who took up the ball ju&s;t
as <HI>Steele</HI> dropt it, and kept it up for the re&s;t of the evening. They
who have never been pre&s;ent at a &s;cene of this kind may &s;ee the whole
group of drunken characters, di&s;played at one view with infinite humour, in
<HI>Hogarth's Modern Midnight Conver&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P>THUS exce&s;s of drinking verifies all the transformations
recorded in the fable of <HI>Circe</HI>'s cup; and perhaps the true rea&s;on
why <HI>Bacchus</HI> is always painted with horns, is to in|timate that wine
turns men into bea&s;ts. Indeed, if none were to indulge them&s;elves in
drinking, except tho&s;e who, like <HI>Steele</HI> and <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI>
could be witty and agreeable in their cups, the number of hard-drinkers would
be very hap|pily dimini&s;hed. Mo&s;t men have &s;o little right to plead an
excu&s;e of this &s;ort in vindication of their drunkenne&s;s, that wine either
makes them very rude, very &s;tupid, or very mad. It is a vulgar error to
&s;uppo&s;e that liquor only &s;hews ill qualities, &s;ince it al&s;o
frequently creates them; and engen|ders notions in the mind quite foreign to
its natural di&s;po&s;i|tion, which are the mere effects of wine, and break
out, like blotches and carbuncles on the face. The di&s;gu&s;tful appearance,
which mo&s;t people make when they are drunk, was what induced the
<HI>Spartans</HI> to intoxicate their &s;laves, and &s;hew them to their
children, in order to deter them from &s;o odious a vice: In like manner let
the Choice Spirit, who is often &s;een hanging his head over the pot, or
&s;noring in an armed-chair in a tavern, reflect what a &s;hocking figure he
mu&s;t have made, when he &s;ees the drunken beggar &s;leeping on a bulk, or
rolling in the kennel.</P>
<P><PB N="558" REF="133">WHOEVER thus con&s;iders the motives that
generally in|duce men to give into the&s;e exce&s;&s;es, and how ridiculous and
unhappy they are often rendered by the effects, will hardly be tempted by the
charms of a bottle: and, indeed, Hard-Drinking is frequently one, among the
many evils, that ari&s;e from want of education. The dull &s;quire, &s;ettled
in the country, who has no ta&s;te for literary amu&s;ements, has nothing,
except his dogs and hor&s;es, but his bumper to divert him: and the town
&s;quire fits &s;oaking for the &s;ame rea&s;ons in a tavern. The&s;e are the
common herd of <HI>Bacchus</HI>'s &s;wine: but nothing is more &s;hocking, than
to &s;ee a man of &s;en&s;e thus de&s;troying his parts and con&s;titution. It
not only makes a terrible innovation in his whole frame and intellects; but
al&s;o robs him of the &s;ociety of tho&s;e like him&s;elf, with whom he
&s;hould a&s;&s;ociate, and reduces him to the level of a &s;et of wretches;
&s;ince all may be admitted to his com|pany and conver&s;ation, who are able to
to&s;s off a bumper.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations are &s;ufficient to convince us of the
evils which re&s;ult from hard-drinking: but it will &s;hock us &s;till more,
if we reflect how much it will influence our life and conduct. Whoever is
engaged in a profe&s;&s;ion will never apply to it with &s;ucce&s;s, while he
&s;ticks &s;o clo&s;e to his bottle; and the trade&s;man, who endeavours to
make bu&s;ine&s;s and plea|&s;ure compatible, will never be able to make both
ends meet. Thus whether health, fame, or intere&s;t is regarded, Drunken|ne&s;s
&s;hould be avoided; and we may &s;ay with <HI>Ca&s;&s;io,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Every inordinate cup is unble&s;t, and the
ingredient is a Devil."</Q></P>

<P>_I CANNOT but admire the ingenious device prefixed to the
adverti&s;ements of <HI>Hazard</HI>'s Lottery-Office, in which Fortune is
repre|&s;ented hovering over the heads of a number of people, and &s;cattering
down all kinds of Prizes among them. What Mr. <HI>Hazard</HI> has here
delineated, every adventurer in the late Lottery had pictured to him&s;elf: the
ten thou&s;and con&s;tantly floated before his eyes, and each per&s;on had
already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it in imagination. But alas! all our expectations are
now at an end; the golden dream is at length vani&s;hed; and tho&s;e, who were
kept giddy all the while that the wheel of For|tune <PB N="560" REF="135"> was
turning round, have now lei&s;ure &s;oberly to reflect on their
di&s;appointment. How many unhappy trade&s;men mu&s;t now trudge on foot all
their lives, who de&s;igned to loll in their chariots! how many poor maidens,
of good family but no fortune, mu&s;t langui&s;h all their days with|out the
comforts of an hu&s;band and a coach and fix! Every lo&s;er thinks him&s;elf
ill u&s;ed by Fortune: and even Mrs. <HI>Betty,</HI> the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a
&s;ingle &s;ixteenth, flies to the Office, pays her penny, and receives the
tidings of her ill luck with &s;urprize; goes to another Office, pays her
penny, hears the &s;ame di&s;agreeable information, and can hardly, very hardly
per&s;uade her&s;elf, that Fortune &s;hould have doom|ed her &s;till to wa&s;h
the di&s;hes and &s;crub down the &s;tairs.</P>
<P>THUS the views of every adventurer are directed to the &s;ame
point, though their motives for engaging in the Lot|tery may be different. One
man puts in, becau&s;e he is willing to be in Fortune's way; another, becau&s;e
he had good luck in the la&s;t; and another, becau&s;e he never got any thing
before. This indulges in the pro&s;pect of making a fortune, and that buoys
him&s;elf up with the hopes of retrieving his de&s;perate circum&s;tances.
Every one, however, thinks him&s;elf as &s;ure of the ten thou&s;and, as if he
had it in his pocket; and his only concern is, how to di&s;po&s;e of it. In
this light we may con&s;ider every adventurer, as having been in actual
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this trea&s;ure; and out of fifty thou&s;and people, who
have been ble&s;t within this fortnight with &s;uch ideal good fortune, I
&s;hall &s;elect the fol|lowing in&s;tances, which fell within my own
notice.</P>
<P>JOSEPH WILKINS of <HI>Thames Street</HI> E&s;quire, Oilman and
Chee&s;emonger, got the 10,000 l. He could not bear <PB N="561" REF="136"> the
foggy air and dingy &s;ituation of the City: he therefore re&s;olved to take an
hou&s;e at the St. <HI>James</HI>'s end of the town, and intended to fit up a
&s;nug box at <HI>Hamp&s;tead</HI> in the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> ta&s;te, for his
retirement on Sundays. A Chariot was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to carry him
to and from <HI>'Change</HI> every morning: but he de&s;igned to have it made
accord|ing to the modern fa&s;hion, that it might occa&s;ionally be con|verted
into a Po&s;t-Chai&s;e, to wheel him on a Saturday night to his Country-&s;eat,
and back again on the Monday morning. Nothing was now wanting but a careful
plod|ding partner, who &s;hould take upon him&s;elf the whole drudgery of the
&s;hop; &s;o that the Squire might have no farther trouble than to receive his
dividend of the profits. But while he was con&s;idering on whom this important
favour &s;hould be conferred, his ticket was drawn&mdash;blank: and Squire
<HI>Wilkins</HI> is contented with his grea&s;y employment of mea&s;uring out
lamp-oil, and cutting out penny-worths of <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> Chee&s;e.</P>
<P>JOHN JONES of <HI>Ludlow</HI> in the county of <HI>Salop</HI>
E&s;quire, Dealer and Chapman, got the 10,000 l. This gentleman was fore-warned
of his &s;ucce&s;s by &s;everal undeniable to|kens. His lady had dreamt of a
<HI>particular Number</HI> four nights together; and while the bells were
ringing upon his being cho&s;e Bailiff of the Corporation, they &s;poke in as
plain words, as ever <HI>Whittington</HI> heard, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Mr. John Jones will get ten thou&s;and
pound&mdash;Mr. John Jones will get ten thou&s;and pound.</HI>"</Q> He and his
lady therefore came up to <HI>London:</HI> and not being able to meet with the
<HI>particular Number</HI> at <HI>Hazard</HI>'s or <HI>Wil&s;on</HI>'s or any
other Office always remarkable for &s;elling the ten thou&s;ands, they
advertized it <PB N="562" REF="137"> in the papers, and got the great Prize,
for only paying a guinea more for their ticket than the market-price. As Mrs.
<HI>Jones</HI> knew a good deal of the world, (having lived for &s;ome years in
quality of an upper &s;ervant in a great hou&s;e,) &s;he was determined that
Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> &s;hould take the opportunity, now they were in town, of
learning how to behave him&s;elf as he &s;hould do, when he came to his
fortune. She therefore introduced him into the be&s;t com|pany in all the
hou&s;e-keepers and &s;tewards rooms in the be&s;t families, where &s;he was
acquainted: and as Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was &s;o deficient in politene&s;s, as
not even to know how to make a bow in coming into a room, he had private
le&s;&s;ons from Mr. <HI>Dukes,</HI> who undertakes to teach Grown Gentle|men
to dance. Mrs. <HI>Jones</HI> her&s;elf was very bu&s;y in con|&s;ulting with
the milliner and mantua-maker about the newe&s;t fa&s;hions, when the long
looked-for ten thou&s;and came up: and directly after the <HI>Hey-Ge-Ho</HI>
carried them down again to <HI>Salop</HI> with this only con&s;olation, that
their ticket was within one of the fortunate Number.</P>
<P>JONATHAN WILDGOOSE of <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> Silk Mercer, had too
much ta&s;te to be confined to dirty bu&s;ine&s;s, which he neglected for the
more agreeable per&s;uits of plea&s;ure. Having therefore met with great
lo&s;&s;es in trade, he was obliged to embark the remains of his &s;hattered
fortune in the Lottery, and by purcha&s;ing a number of tickets &s;ecured to
him&s;elf the 10,000 l. He had determined to keep his &s;ucce&s;s &s;ecret,
bilk his creditors by becoming bankrupt, turn the whole into an annuity for his
life, and live abroad like a gentleman upon the income. But unluckily his
creditors came upon him too quickly; and before he could know that he had
<HI>not</HI> got the ten thou&s;and, hurried him <PB N="563" REF="138"> to
jail, where he now lies, lamenting that the <HI>Act of In&s;ol|vency</HI> was
not po&s;tponed 'till after the Lottery.</P>
<P>SIR HUMPHRY OLDCASTLE, having greatly dipt his e&s;tate by being
cho&s;en into Parliament on the Tory intere&s;t, mortgaged all he had left, to
put him&s;elf in the way of the the 10,000l. for the good of his country. This
&s;ea&s;onable recruit fixed him a &s;taunch patriot: and he declared he would
&s;tand another election again&s;t all oppo&s;itions. But, however it happened,
the fini&s;hing of the lottery has induced him to change his &s;entiments; and
Sir <HI>Humphry</HI> in lieu of the 10,000 l. has accepted a place.</P>
<P>JEMMY LISTER, an Attorney's Clerk, was carried into the Lottery
by pure di&s;intere&s;ted love. He had conceived a violent pa&s;&s;ion for his
ma&s;ter's daughter; but the prudent old gentleman could not be prevailed on to
give her away to an hand&s;ome young fellow without a penny. This enra|ged him
&s;o much, that he was in doubt whether he &s;hould be&s;tow his 10,000 l. on
the young lady, or employ it more fa&s;hionably in keeping a girl. However, his
hopes &s;oon &s;unk to one of the 5,000 l. prizes, which he at once deter|mined
to &s;ettle upon her together with his per&s;on. But in this too he was
di&s;appointed, as al&s;o of the other inferior prizes; and having received a
po&s;itive refu&s;al from his mi&s;tre&s;s, out of mere &s;pite he directly
married the maid.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN MAC MULLEN, a decayed Game&s;ter, made a &s;hift to
purcha&s;e the <HI>Chance</HI> of a Ticket, which came up 10,000l. He
immediately flew to <HI>Arthur</HI>'s (late <HI>White</HI>'s,) ri&s;ked it all
at Hazard, &s;et the whole table, and &s;tript the company of their la&s;t
&s;hilling. After this he bought running-hor&s;es, made matches, carried off
the be&s;t plates, and took in all the Knowing-Ones on the Turf. But &s;o
fluctuating is the &s;ituation of a Game&s;ter, that at the end of the Lottery 
<PB N="564" REF="139"> he found that Fortune had left him in the lurch, without
&s;o much as a groat to buy an halter.

<P>I NEED not point out any particular in&s;tances among the other
&s;ex, with re&s;pect to their di&s;po&s;al of the 10,000 l. which every lady
had &s;ecured by chu&s;ing the ticket her&s;elf, taking particular care that
the number be an odd one. The married ladies have &s;ufficient calls for even
double this &s;um, to &s;upply them with the nece&s;&s;aries of dre&s;s, and to
an&s;wer the expences of frequenting public diver&s;ions: and as to the
unmarried ladies, they very well know the truth of that maxim in the ballad,
that 
<Q REND="inline">"in ten thou&s;and pounds ten thou&s;and charms
are center'd."</Q> Some ancient maiden ladies, who could never be brought to
think of an hu&s;band, or to give into the vanities of the world, were
re&s;olved to live retired upon their Prize in the country, and leave proofs of
their good di&s;po&s;itions behind them, by &s;welling out their Wills with a
long li&s;t of <HI>Items</HI> to this or that charity or ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, I cannot but take notice of the great
genero&s;ity of my own PUBLISHER upon getting the 10,000 l. As his &s;ucce&s;s
was owing to his laying out in the Lottery all the profits, which had already
ri&s;en from the publication of this Paper, he had determined to circulate my
future numbers <HI>gratis</HI>; and had even de&s;igned to keep open hou&s;e
for the re|ception of poor authors. Unhappily for the public, as well as my
brother-writers, Fortune has fru&s;trated his di&s;intere&s;ted &s;cheme: Even
I my&s;elf am admitted to eat his mutton but once a week; and (in&s;tead of
giving away my papers) he has adverti&s;ed, that the <HI>Twelves</HI> edition
of the CONNOISSEUR will be publi&s;hed on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 25th of this
in&s;tant <HI>No|vember,</HI> in <HI>Two Pocket Volumes, Price</HI> Six

<P>_AS I was going through <HI>Smithfield</HI> the other day, I
ob&s;erved an old fellow with a wooden leg, dre&s;t in a &s;ailor's habit, who
courte|ou&s;ly invited the pa&s;&s;er-by to peep into his raree-&s;how, for the
&s;mall price of an half|penny. His exhibitions, I found, were very well
&s;uited to the times, and quite in character for him&s;elf: for among other
particulars, with which he amu&s;ed the little audience of children that
&s;urrounded his box, I was mightily plea&s;ed to hear the following, 
<Q REND="inline">"&mdash;there you &s;ee the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
fleet per&s;uing the <HI>French</HI> &s;hips, which are running
away&mdash;there you &s;ee Major-General <HI>John&s;on</HI> beating the
<HI>French</HI> &s;oldiers in <HI>America,</HI> and taking Count
<HI>Die&s;kau</HI> pri|&s;oner&mdash;there you &s;ee the <HI>Grand
Monarque,</HI> upon his <PB N="566" REF="141"> knees before King
<HI>George,</HI> begging his life."</Q> As the thoughts of the public are now
wholly turned upon war, it is no wonder that every method is taken to in&s;pire
us with a love of our country, and an abhorrence of the <HI>French</HI> king:
and not only the old &s;eaman with his raree-&s;how, but the public theatres
have likewi&s;e had a view to the &s;ame point. At <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> we have
already been enter|tained with the <HI>Humours of the Navy</HI>; and I am
a&s;&s;ured, that at <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Mr. <HI>Barry</HI> will make an
entire con|que&s;t of <HI>France</HI> in the per&s;on of that renowned hero
<HI>Henry the fifth.</HI> And as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are naturally fond of
bloody exhibitions on the &s;tage, I am told that a new Pantomime, entitled the
<HI>Ohio,</HI> is preparing at this la&s;t hou&s;e, more terrible than any of
it's <HI>Hells, Devils,</HI> and <HI>fiery Dragons;</HI> in which will be
introduced the <HI>Indian Manner of Fighting,</HI> to conclude with a
repre&s;entation of the Grand <HI>Scalping Dance with all its Horrors.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE this warlike di&s;po&s;ition prevails in the nation, I am
under &s;ome apprehen&s;ions, le&s;t the attention of the public &s;hould be
called off from the weighty concerns of the&s;e papers. I already perceive,
that the common news|papers are more eagerly &s;natched up in the public
coffee-hou&s;es than my e&s;&s;ays; and the <HI>Gazette</HI> is much oftener
called for than the <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur.</HI> For the&s;e rea&s;ons I find it
nece&s;&s;ary to lay open my own importance before the public, to &s;hew that I
my&s;elf am acting (as it were) in a military capacity, and that
Cen&s;or-General TOWN has done his country no le&s;s &s;ervice as a valiant and
&s;kilful com|mander at home, than Major-General <HI>John&s;on</HI> in
<HI>America.</HI> Authors may very properly be &s;aid to be engaged in a
&s;tate of literary warfare; many of whom are taken into <PB N="567" REF="142">
pay by tho&s;e great and mighty potentates the book&s;ellers: and it will be
allowed, that they undergo no le&s;s hard&s;hips in the &s;ervice, than the
common &s;oldiers who are contented to be &s;hot at for a groat a day.</P>
<P>IT has been my province to repell the daily inroads and
encroachments made by vice and folly, and to guard the nation from an
inva&s;ion of foreign fopperies and <HI>French</HI> fa&s;hions. The town has
been principally the &s;cene of action; where I have found enemies to encounter
with, no le&s;s formidable than the <HI>Tquattotquaws</HI> or the
<HI>Chickchimuckchis</HI> of <HI>North-America.</HI> But as the curio&s;ity of
the public is &s;o much engaged in attending to the enterprizes of Old
<HI>Hendrick</HI> the <HI>Sachem,</HI> and the incur&s;ions of <HI>Indians</HI>
who have taken up the hatchet again&s;t our Colonies, I am afraid that my
exploits again&s;t the Savages, which infe&s;t this metropolis, will be wholly
over-looked. I have therefore re&s;olved to give my readers fre&s;h advices
from time to time of what pa&s;&s;es here, drawn up in the &s;ame warlike
&s;tile and manner as tho&s;e very alarming articles of news, which are
commonly to be met with in our public papers.</P>
<P>WE hear from <HI>White</HI>'s, that the forces under Major
General <HI>Hoyle,</HI> which u&s;ed to encamp at that place, are removed from
thence, and have fixed their winter quarters at <HI>Arthur</HI>'s. The &s;ame
letters &s;ay, that an ob&s;tinate engage|ment was fought there a few nights
ago, in which one party gained a great booty, and the other &s;uffered a
con&s;i|derable lo&s;s. We are al&s;o informed, that an epidemical di&s;temper
rages among them, and that &s;everal of the chiefs have been carried off by a
&s;udden death.</P>
<P><PB N="568" REF="143">THEY write from <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI>
that la&s;t week a Body of <HI>Irregulars</HI> &s;allied out at midnight,
&s;tormed &s;everal forts in that neighbourhood, and committed great outrages;
but being attacked by a detachment from the allied army of watchmen,
con&s;tables, and ju&s;tices, they were put to flight, and &s;everal of them
taken pri&s;oners. The plague &s;till rages there with great violence, as well
as in the neigh|bouring territories of <HI>Drury.</HI></P>
<P>WE hear from the &s;ame place, that the <HI>Company</HI>
com|manded by Brigadier <HI>Rich</HI> has been reinforced with &s;everal
new-rai&s;ed recruits to &s;upply the place of &s;ome de&s;erters, who had gone
over to the enemy: but his chief dependance is on the light-armed troops, which
are very active, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed, like the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> by
their party-coloured dre&s;s. The enemy, on the other hand, have taken
&s;everal <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> into pay; though they were at
fir&s;t under terrible apprehen&s;ions of their being &s;et upon by the
<HI>Critics.</HI> The&s;e are a rude, ignorant, &s;avage people, who are always
at war with the nation of <HI>Authors.</HI> Their con&s;tant manner of fighting
is to begin the on&s;et with &s;trange hi&s;&s;ings and noi&s;es, accompanied
with an horrid in&s;trument, named the <HI>Cat-call</HI>; which, like the
<HI>War-hoop</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> has &s;truck a panic into the hearts
of the &s;toute&s;t heroes.</P>
<P>WE have advice from the <HI>Butcher Row,</HI> that on monday
night la&s;t the <HI>Infidels</HI> held a grand Council of war at their head
quarters in the <HI>Robin Hood,</HI> at which their good friend and ally, the
<HI>Mufti</HI> of <HI>Clare-market,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted in per&s;on. After many
debates, they re&s;olved to declare war again&s;t the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI>
and never to make peace, till they had pulled <PB N="569" REF="144"> down all
the Churches in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;hed the
<HI>Alcoran</HI> of <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> in lieu of the Bible.</P>
<P>ALL our advices from the City of <HI>London</HI> agree in their
accounts of the great havock and &s;laughter made there on the Fe&s;tival,
commonly called <HI>My Lord Mayor's Day.</HI> All the <HI>Companies</HI> in
their black uniform, and the trained bands in their regimentals, made a general
forage. They carried off va&s;t quantities of chickens, gee&s;e, ducks, and all
kinds of provi&s;ions. Major <HI>Guzzledown</HI> of <HI>Ba&s;&s;i&s;haw</HI>
di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf greatly, having with &s;word in hand gallantly
attacked the out-works, &s;caled the walls, mounted the ramparts, and forced
through the covert-way of a large fortified Cu&s;tard, which &s;eemed
impregnable.</P>
<P>THE Inhabitants of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> have lately been alarmed
with the apprehen&s;ions of an Inva&s;ion; as the <HI>French</HI> have been
very bu&s;y in fitting out &s;everal &s;mall ve&s;&s;els laden with &s;tores of
wine and brandy, with which it is thought they will attempt to make a de&s;cent
&s;omewhere on our coa&s;ts. The Independant Companies of <HI>Smugglers</HI> in
the &s;ervice of <HI>France</HI> are to be &s;ent on this expedition: but if
the fleet of Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e &s;macks, &amp;c. do not intercept them at &s;ea,
we are preparing to receive them as &s;oon as they are landed.</P>
<P>FROM divers parts of the country we have advice, that the roads
are every where crowded with Ladies, who (not|with&s;tanding the &s;everity of
the weather) are hurrying up to <HI>London,</HI> to be pre&s;ent at the meeting
of the <HI>Female Parli|ament.</HI> At this critical juncture the fate of the
nation de|pends entirely on the deliberations of this wi&s;e and augu&s;t
A&s;&s;embly: and as there are known to be many di&s;intere&s;ted 
<PB N="570" REF="145"> patriots in the Hou&s;e, it is not to be doubted but
that proper mea&s;ures will be per&s;ued for the good of their country. Many
&s;alutary laws are already talked of, which we could wi&s;h to &s;ee put in
execution; &s;uch as&mdash;A Bill for prohibiting the importation of
<HI>French</HI> Milliners, Hair|cutters, and Mantua-makers.&mdash;A Bill for
the exportation of <HI>French</HI> Cooks and <HI>French</HI> Valets de
Chambres.&mdash;A Bill to re&s;train Ladies from wearing <HI>French
Dre&s;&s;es.</HI>&mdash;And la&s;tly, a Bill to re&s;train them from wearing
<HI>French Faces.</HI></P>

<P>_AS every marriage is a kind of family fe&s;tival, the
wedding-day is honoured with various celebrities, and di&s;tingui&s;hed like
the fifth of <HI>November,</HI> the birth-days of the Royal Family, or any
other public day, with many demon&s;trations of joy: The happy couple are
dre&s;t in their riche&s;t &s;uits, the bells ring all day, and the evening is
con|cluded with the merry ceremony of throwing the Stocking. But the&s;e
fe&s;tivities are not always &s;o religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved in Town, where many
a pair of quality are tacked together with the utmo&s;t privacy, and
immediately after &s;neak out of town, as if they were a&s;hamed to &s;hew
their faces after what they had done. In the Country, when the &s;quire, or 
<PB N="572" REF="147"> any other per&s;on of di&s;tinction is married, the
Honey-Moon is almo&s;t a continued Carnival: and every marriage is ac|counted
more or le&s;s likely to be pro&s;perous, in proportion to the number of deer,
oxen, and &s;heep, that are killed on the occa&s;ion, and the hog&s;heads of
wine and tuns of ale, with which they are wa&s;hed down. By the la&s;t po&s;t I
received an account from my Cou&s;in VILLAGE, of the wedding of a near
relation, with a particular detail of the magnificence of the entertainment,
the &s;plendor of the ball, and the uni|ver&s;al joy of the whole manour. At
the &s;ame time I received compliments from the new-married couple, with a
large &s;lice of the BRIDE-CAKE; the virtues of which are well known to every
girl of thirteen. I was never in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of this nuptial charm
before: but I was &s;o much delighted with this matrimonial token, and it
excited in my mind &s;o many reflections on conjugal happine&s;s, that (though
I did not lay it under my pillow,) it gave oc|ca&s;ion to the following
Dream.</P>
<P>I FOUND my&s;elf in the middle of a &s;pacious building, which
was crouded with a variety of per&s;ons of both &s;exes; and upon enquiry was
told, that it was the Temple of the God of Marriage; and that every one who had
an incli|nation to &s;acrifice to that Deity, was invited to approach a large
altar which was covered with a great number of CAKES of different &s;hapes and
appearance. Some of the&s;e were moulded into the form of hearts; and others
were woven into true-lovers-knots: &s;ome were &s;trewed with &s;ugar, and
&s;tuck about with &s;weet-meats; &s;ome were covered with gold; &s;ome were
&s;tamped with coronets; and others had their tops embelli&s;hed with
glittering toys, that repre&s;ented a fine hou&s;e, a &s;et of jewels, a coach
and <PB N="573" REF="148"> &s;ix or the like. <HI>Plutus</HI> and
<HI>Cupid</HI> were bu&s;ily employed in di&s;tributing the&s;e Cakes (which
were all of them marked with the word MATRIMONY, and called BRIDE-CAKES) to
different per&s;ons, who were allowed to chu&s;e for them|&s;elves, according
to their different views and inclinations.</P>
<P>I OBSERVED &s;everal ha&s;ten to the altar, who all appeared to
be differently affected by their choice. To &s;ome the Cakes &s;eemed of &s;o
delicious a flavour, that they imagined they &s;hould never be &s;urfeited;
while others who found the ta&s;te very agreeable at fir&s;t, in a &s;hort time
declared it to be flat and in&s;ipid: However, I could not help remark|ing,
that many more (particularly among the quality) ad|dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to
<HI>Plutus,</HI> than to <HI>Cupid.</HI></P>
<P>BEING de&s;irous to take a nearer view of the company, I
pu&s;hed through the croud, and placed my&s;elf clo&s;e by the altar. A young
couple now advanced, and applying to <HI>Cupid,</HI> de&s;ired him to reach
them one of the Cakes, in the &s;hape of a double heart pearced through with
darts; but ju&s;t as they were going to &s;hare it betwixt them, a crabbed old
fellow, whom I found to be the girl's father, &s;tepped up, broke the cake in
two, and obliged the young lady to fix upon another which <HI>Plutus</HI>
picked out for her, and which repre&s;ented the figure of a fine gentleman in
gilt ginger-bread.</P>
<P>AN old fellow of &s;ixty-two, who had &s;tolen one day from the
bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>'Change</HI> and the <HI>Alley,</HI> next came towards
the altar, and &s;eemed to expre&s;s a &s;trong de&s;ire for a Cake.
<HI>Plutus,</HI> who recollected him at fir&s;t &s;ight, immedi|ately offered
him one, which, though very mouldy and <PB N="574" REF="149"> coar&s;e, was
gilt all over; but he was a&s;toni&s;hed at the old gentleman's refu&s;ing it,
and petitioning <HI>Cupid</HI> for a Cake of the mo&s;t elegant form and
&s;weete&s;t ingredients of any on the altar. The little God at fir&s;t
repul&s;ed him with indig|nation, but afterwards <HI>&s;old</HI> it to him for
a large &s;um of money; a circum&s;tance which amazed me beyond
expre&s;|&s;ion, but which I &s;oon found was very commonly practi&s;ed in this
Temple. The old fellow retired with his purcha&s;ed prize: and though I
imagined he might &s;till have a colt's tooth remaining, after having for
&s;ome time mumbled it be|tween his old gums in vain, it lay by him untouched
and unenjoyed.</P>
<P>I WAS afterwards very much di&s;gu&s;ted with the many
in&s;tances that occurred, of the&s;e delicate mor&s;els being &s;et up to
&s;ale: and I found, that their price ro&s;e and fell, like that of beef or
mutton, according to the glut or &s;carcity of the market. I was particularly
affected with the di&s;po&s;al of the two following. A young gentleman and lady
were ap|proaching the altar, and had agreed to take between them a Cake of a
plain form but delicious flavour, marked <HI>Love and Competence</HI>; but a
per&s;on of quality &s;tepping forward per&s;uaded the fal&s;e female to join
with him, and receive from <HI>Plutus</HI> a glittering dainty, marked
<HI>Indifference and a large Settlement.</HI> Another lady was coming up with a
Knight of the Bath, being tempted by a Cake with a red ribbon &s;treaming from
it, like the flags on a Twelfth-Cake; but was prevailed on by a per&s;on of
greater rank and di&s;|tinction to accept a more &s;howy Cake, adorned with a
blue ribbon and a coronet.</P>
<P>A BUXOM dame of an amourous complexion came next, and begged
very hard for a Cake. She had before received <PB N="575" REF="150"> &s;everal
which &s;uited her tooth, and plea&s;ed her palate &s;o exce&s;&s;ively, that
as &s;oon as &s;he had di&s;patched one, &s;he con&s;tantly came to
<HI>Cupid</HI> for another. She now &s;eized her Cake with great tran&s;port,
and retiring to a corner with it, I could di&s;cern her greedily mumbling the
delicious mor&s;el, though &s;he had fairly worn out &s;ix and twenty of her
teeth in the &s;ervice. After this an ancient lady came tottering up to the
altar, &s;upported by a young fellow in a red coat with a &s;houlder-knot.
<HI>Plutus</HI> gave him a &s;tale Cake marked with the word JOINTURE in large
golden capitals, which he received with &s;ome reluctance, while the old lady
eagerly &s;natched another from <HI>Cupid,</HI> (who turned his head a&s;ide
from her,) on which I could plainly di&s;cover the word DOTAGE.</P>
<P>A RICH ru&s;ty batchelor of the la&s;t century then came
bu&s;tling through the croud. He brought with him a red|cheeked country girl of
nineteen. As he approached the altar, he met &s;everal coming from it with
Cakes, which he had refu&s;ed: &s;ome of which were marked <HI>Riches,</HI>
&s;ome <HI>Family,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Beauty,</HI> and one or two
<HI>Affection.</HI> The girl he brought with him proved to be his dairy-maid,
whom he had for &s;ome time pa&s;t been in vain attempting to bring over to his
wi&s;hes; but at la&s;t finding his de&s;ign impracticable, he came with her to
the altar. He &s;eemed, indeed, a little a&s;hamed of his undertaking, and
betrayed a good deal of aukwardne&s;s in his manner and deportment. However, as
&s;oon as he had taken his Cake, he retired; and determined to &s;pend the
re&s;t of his days with his milch-cow in the country.</P>
<P>TO &s;atisfy a mode&s;t longing, there now advanced a mai|den
lady in the bloom of three&s;core. She had, it &s;eems, heretofore refu&s;ed
&s;everal offers from <HI>Cupid</HI> and <HI>Plutus</HI>; but 
<PB N="576" REF="151"> being enraged to find, that they had now given over all
thoughts of her, &s;he &s;eized by the hand a young En&s;ign of the Guards, and
carried him to the altar, whence &s;he her|&s;elf &s;natched up a Cake, and
divided it with her gallant. She was highly delighted with the ta&s;te of it at
fir&s;t, but her partner being very &s;oon cloyed, &s;he too late di&s;covered
that the half which &s;he held in her hand was &s;igned <HI>Folly,</HI> and
that which &s;he had forced upon her paramour was marked
<HI>Aver&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>A LITTLE, pert, forward Mi&s;s in a frock and hanging &s;leeves
bri&s;kly ran up to <HI>Cupid,</HI> and begged for a Cake: what it was &s;he
did not care; but a Cake &s;he mu&s;t and would have, of one kind or another.
She had ju&s;t &s;tretched out her hand to receive one from <HI>Cupid,</HI>
when her mamma interpo&s;ed, &s;ent the child back again blubbering to the
boarding-&s;chool, and carried off the Cake her&s;elf.</P>
<P>AN old woman, fanta&s;tically dre&s;t, then bur&s;t into the
Temple, and run raving up to the altar, crying out that her name was MARY
SINGLETON, and &s;he would have an hu&s;|band. But the poor lady &s;eemed
likely to be di&s;appointed; for as &s;he could prevail on no one to join hands
with her, both <HI>Cupid</HI> and <HI>Plutus</HI> refu&s;ed to favour her with
a Cake. Furious with rage and de&s;pair, &s;he &s;natched one off the altar;
and &s;eizing on the fir&s;t man that came in her way, (which unfortunately
happened to be my&s;elf,) &s;he would have crammed it forcibly down my throat.
As the lea&s;t crumb of it was as di&s;agreeable as a drench to an hor&s;e, I
began to &s;pawl and &s;putter and keck; and though the flurry of &s;pirits,
which it occa&s;ioned, awaked me, I thought I had the nau&s;eous ta&s;te of it
&s;till in my mouth.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AMONG the many <HI>Regi&s;ter Offices</HI> erected within
the&s;e few years pa&s;t, I am &s;urprized that no &s;cheme of the like nature
has been thought of for the &s;ervice of literature; and that no place has been
&s;et apart, where Literary Commodities of every &s;ort might be di&s;po&s;ed
of; where men of learning might meet with employment, and where others, who
want their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, might be &s;ure to <PB N="578" REF="153"> meet
with men of learning. There is nothing of this kind in being at pre&s;ent,
except among the book&s;ellers; who have made a monopoly of the trade, and
engro&s;&s;ed the whole market to them&s;elves. To remedy this inconvenience,
my de&s;ign is to &s;et up a LITERARY REGISTER OFFICE: for which purpo&s;e I
intend to hire the now u&s;ele&s;s theatre in <HI>Lincolns Inn Fields,</HI> and
convert it into a mart for the &s;taple commodities of the literary
commonwealth. I &s;hall here fit up apartments for the reception of my authors,
who will be employed from time to time in &s;upplying the public with the
requi&s;ite manufactures. This &s;cheme, will, I doubt not, meet with great
encouragement, as it is of general utility: and I do not remember any de&s;ign
of the &s;ame nature, except at a barber's on the other &s;ide the water, who
has hung out a board over his &s;hop with the following
in|&s;cription&mdash;<HI>Letters read and written for Servants and
others.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL always have a fre&s;h a&s;&s;ortment of goods in the
be&s;t ta&s;te and newe&s;t fa&s;hion: as of Novels for example, while the
humour of reading them is prevalent among all ranks of people. For this branch
I &s;hall retain a very emi|nent ma&s;ter-novelli&s;t, to cut out adventures
and intrigues; and &s;hall employ a proper number of hands to fini&s;h the work
with all po&s;&s;ible care and expedition: and if any ladies of quality, or
others, chu&s;e to furni&s;h their own materials for Memoirs and Apologies,
they may have them done up, and be fitted exactly, at my Office. Be&s;ides
&s;everal others, which my men &s;hall get up with the greate&s;t di&s;patch, I
can a&s;&s;ure you I have my&s;elf worked night and day, and have already
fini&s;hed &s;ix and thirty &s;heets of the Hi&s;tory of Mi&s;s <HI>Sukey
Sapling,</HI> Written by Her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="579" REF="154">PAMPHLETS of all &s;orts &s;hall be
compo&s;ed, whenever any popular &s;ubject &s;tarts up, that is likely to
engage the attention of the public. Every new play &s;hall be followed by an
<HI>Examen</HI> or <HI>Remarks:</HI> all riots at either play-hou&s;e will
afford &s;cope for <HI>Letters to the Managers</HI>; and every new actor or
actre&s;s produce theatrical critici&s;ms. Poetry, you know, Mr. TOWN, is a
mere drug; but I &s;hall always have a number of ready-made Odes by me, which
may be &s;uited to any Great Man, dead or alive, in place or out of place. I
&s;hall al&s;o have a large bundle of <HI>Poems on &s;everal Occa&s;ions,</HI>
very proper for any gentleman or lady, who chu&s;es to publi&s;h by
&s;ub&s;cription; be&s;ides a more ordinary &s;ort of Hymns to the Morning,
Ver&s;es on the Death of &mdash;, Odes to Mi&s;s <HI>A. B. C.</HI> Acro&s;tics
and Re|bu&s;&s;es, for the u&s;e of the Magazines: to be &s;old a penny|worth,
with allowance to tho&s;e who take a great quantity.</P>
<P>WITH regard to Law matters, as they have no &s;ort of
connexion with wit or learning, I &s;hall not concern my&s;elf with their
unintelligible jargon; nor pre&s;ume to interfere with tho&s;e authors in
parchment, who mea&s;ure their words by the foot-rule, and &s;ell their
writings at &s;o much <HI>per</HI> line. How|ever, I &s;hall furni&s;h young
Students of the &s;everal Inns of Court with complete Canons of Critici&s;m,
and Opinions on any new theatrical Ca&s;es; on which they may argue very
learnedly at a tavern, or plead at the bar of a coffee-hou&s;e. For Medical
&s;ubjects, I &s;hall procure a learned Graduate by <HI>Diploma</HI> from
abroad, who&s;e practice will not &s;o much take up his time as to prevent his
being at lei&s;ure to write oc|ca&s;ional treati&s;es, &s;etting forth the
virtues of any newly-invented Powder, or newly-di&s;covered Water. He &s;hall
al&s;o draw up the adverti&s;ements for medicines, that remove 
<PB N="580" REF="155"> all di&s;ea&s;es, and are never known to fail; he
&s;hall compile the wonderful accounts of their &s;urpri&s;ing cures; and
fur|ni&s;h ca&s;es that never happened, and affidavits that were never made.
With re&s;pect to Divinity, as I have rea&s;on to believe that controver&s;ial
writings will be often called for, I intend to bargain with the <HI>Robin
Hood</HI> Society to undertake in the lump to furni&s;h my Office with Defences
of Lord <HI>Bo|lingbroke,</HI> &amp;c. and till I can procure &s;ome poor
curate out of the country, or &s;ervitor from the univer&s;ity, to write the
<HI>Manu&s;cript Sermons of eminent Divines lately decea&s;ed, war|ranted
originals,</HI> I mu&s;t make &s;hift with the <HI>Fleet Par&s;ons</HI> now out
of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THOUGH I &s;hall not keep any dramatic works ready made by me,
(as the&s;e commodities are apt to grow &s;tale and out of fa&s;hion,) yet
either of the theatres may be &s;erved with tragedy, comedy, farce, or the
like, by be&s;peaking them, and giving but three days notice. For the comic
pieces I &s;hall employ a poet, who has long worked for the drolls at
<HI>Bar|tholomew</HI> and <HI>Southwark</HI> fairs, and has printed a comedy as
it was <HI>half</HI> acted at <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI> My tragedies will be
furni&s;hed by a <HI>North Briton,</HI> who walked up to <HI>London</HI> from
his native country la&s;t winter with a mo&s;t &s;ublime tragedy in his
coat-pocket, and which is now to be di&s;po&s;ed of to the be&s;t bidder. Any
old play of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> or <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> &s;hall be pieced
with modern ones according to the pre&s;ent ta&s;te, or cut out in airs and
recitative for an <HI>Engli&s;h Opera.</HI> Rhymes for Pantomimes may be had,
to be &s;et to the clack of a mill, the tinkling of a tin ca&s;cade, or the
&s;laps of <HI>Harlequin</HI>'s wooden &s;word. The proprietors of our public
Gardens, during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, may be al&s;o <PB N="581" REF="156">
&s;upplied from my Office with Love-Songs to a new burthen, or comic Dialogues
in <HI>Crambo</HI>; and words &s;hall, at any time be fitted to the mu&s;ic,
after the tunes are compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>AS I propo&s;e to make my Office of general utility, every
thing that bears the lea&s;t affinity to literature will be natu|rally
comprehended in my Scheme. Members of Parliament may be &s;upplied with
Speeches on any political &s;ubject; and Country Ju&s;tices may, on directing a
letter to the Office po&s;t paid, have Charges to the Jury at the Quarter
Se&s;&s;ions &s;ent down to them by the fir&s;t coach or waggon. Addre&s;&s;es
on particular occa&s;ions &s;hall be drawn up for the wor&s;hipful mayor and
aldermen of any city or corporation: Laws, Rules, Regulations, or Orders,
&s;hall be formed for the <HI>Anti-Gallicans, Ubiquarians, Gregorians,</HI> or
any private clubs and &s;ocieties. <HI>N. B.</HI> The <HI>Free Ma&s;ons</HI>
may depend upon &s;ecre&s;y.</P>
<P>MANY advantages may likewi&s;e accrue to the polite world from
the e&s;tabli&s;hment of my Office. Gentlemen and ladies may have
<HI>Billet-doaux</HI> written for them with the mo&s;t &s;oft and langui&s;hing
expre&s;&s;ions: Me&s;&s;age Cards, and Invitations to Routs, &s;hall be filled
up and cir|culated at &s;o much <HI>per</HI> hundred, or undertaken in the
gro&s;s at a fixed price all the year round. Beaux may be accommodated with
letters of gallantry to &s;end to their laundre&s;&s;es, or have them copied
out in a fa&s;hionable female &s;crawl, and directed to them&s;elves; which
they may &s;hew about as coming from ladies of quality in love with them.
Gentlemen who love fighting, but cannot write, may have challenges pen'd for
them in the true &s;tile and &s;pirit of a modern Blood.</P>
<P><PB N="582" REF="157">THERE are many other conveniencies
ari&s;ing from &s;uch an Office, which it would be too tedious to enume|rate:
and it will be found to be no le&s;s beneficial to you authors, Mr. TOWN, than
tho&s;e other <HI>Regi&s;ter Offices</HI> are to men and maid-&s;ervants. If an
author (for example) wants employment, or is out of place, he has nothing to do
but to enter his name with me, and I &s;hall pre&s;ently get him work: or if a
book&s;eller wants an hand for any particular job, (as a
tran&s;lation-&s;pinner, a novel-weaver, a play-wright, a ver&s;e-turner, or
the like) upon &s;earching my books he will be &s;ure to meet with a man fit
for the bu&s;ine&s;s. In &s;hort, any compo&s;ition, in pro&s;e or rhyme, and
on any &s;ubject, may be procured at a minute's warning, by ap|plying to my
Office: and I dare &s;ay, you your&s;elf, Mr. TOWN, will be very glad now and
then to purcha&s;e a <HI>Con|noi&s;&s;eur</HI> of me, whenever the idle fit
&s;eizes you. If that &s;hould happen to come upon you this week, and you have
nothing better, you will oblige me by laying the &s;cheme here &s;ent before
your readers; and in return, you &s;hall have the credit of publi&s;hing your
papers at my Office, as &s;oon as it is opened, and welcome.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P>_I REMEMBER to have heard a cou&s;in of mine, who was formerly
at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> often men|tion a &s;ect of Philo&s;ophers
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the re&s;t of the collegians by the appellation of
<HI>Tuft-Hunters.</HI> The&s;e were not the di&s;ciples of the <HI>Stoics</HI>
or <HI>Epicureans,</HI> or the advocates for the old or new philo&s;ophy, but
the followers, literally &s;peaking, of the fellow-commoners, noblemen, and
other rich &s;tudents, whom, it &s;eems, the courte&s;y of the Univer|&s;ity
has honoured with a cap adorned with a gold to&s;&s;el. The&s;e few gold
threads have almo&s;t as much influence in the Univer&s;ity as a red or blue
ribband at court, and always draw after the wearer a train of humble
companions, who <PB N="584" REF="159"> will be at his call to breakfa&s;t,
dine, or &s;up with him whenever he plea&s;es, will go with him any where,
drink with him, wench with him, borrow his money, or let him pay their
reckoning. They are, I am told, a &s;ort of di&s;ea&s;e of the place, which a
man of fortune is &s;ure to catch as &s;oon as he arrives there: and the&s;e
fa&s;t friends &s;tick &s;o clo&s;e to him, that he can never &s;hake them off,
while he keeps his gown on his back.</P>
<P>THE Univer&s;ity of <HI>London</HI> is not without its
<HI>Tuft-Hunters,</HI> who fa&s;ten, like leeches, on a young man of fortune at
his fir&s;t coming to town. They be&s;et him as &s;oon as he arrives, and when
they have once &s;urrounded him, &s;eldom fail of &s;e|curing him to
them&s;elves; for no per&s;ons of character care to have any connections with
him, when he has been fre|quently &s;een in &s;uch bad company. It is a great
misfortune for any young gentleman to fall into their hands: though indeed, as
a fool is the natural prey of knaves, the wealthy maintainers of this
fraternity are generally none of the wi|&s;e&s;t: And as at the Univer&s;ity, 
<Q REND="inline">"where the learned pate ducks to the golden
fool,"</Q> the gentleman-&s;tudent is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a cap with a gold
tuft, I always con&s;ider the&s;e &s;ons of folly in town as adorned with a
&s;howy cap hung with bells, which &s;erve at once to denote the depth of their
parts, and to call their train about them.</P>
<P>THE dialect of the town has very expre&s;&s;ively
charac|teri&s;ed the&s;e humble dependants on men of fortune by the name of
<HI>Hangers-on.</HI> They will, indeed, take &s;uch &s;ure hold, and hang on a
man &s;o con&s;tantly, that it is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible to drop them.
Whenever the gentleman appears, the <HI>Hanger-on</HI> is &s;ure to be at his
elbow. They will &s;queeze <PB N="585" REF="160"> them&s;elves into every party
that is formed; and I have known in&s;tances of their thru&s;ting them&s;elves
into &s;trange families, by &s;ticking to their patron's &s;kirts, and
impu|dently introducing them&s;elves where he has been invited to dinner:
which, indeed, I think would not be an im|proper cu&s;tom, provided they would
&s;ubmit to &s;tand behind his chair. They will &s;tick &s;o clo&s;ely, that
all the adhe&s;ive quality of burs, pitch, &amp;c. &s;eem to be collected in
them; and the line in <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> &s;o often
ridiculed, may rather be con&s;idered as empha&s;is than tautology in
&s;peaking of Them. The <HI>Hanger-on</HI> clings to his fool, as
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> did to the rock, and in <HI>Pope</HI>'s words, 
<Q> 
<L>They STICK ADHERENT, and SUSPENDED HANG.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE tenaciou&s;ne&s;s of a <HI>Hanger-on</HI> is &s;o very
&s;trong, that whoever is drawn into their &s;nares, is &s;o firmly limed he
can hardly ever loo&s;e him&s;elf from them. For as nothing but the lowe&s;t
meanne&s;s of &s;pirit could ever prevail on a man to &s;ubmit to &s;uch
dependance on another, it is in vain to think of getting rid of &s;uch abject
wretches by treating them with contempt. They will take as much beating,
provided you will allow them an equal degree of familiarity, as a &s;paniel.
They will al&s;o &s;ubmit to do any little offices, and are glad to make
them&s;elves u&s;eful, whenever they have an opportunity. They will go among
the brokers to borrow money for you, pimp for you, or &s;ubmit to any other
&s;uch gentleman-like employment to &s;erve their friend.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t here be noted, that every <HI>Hanger-on</HI> is a
per&s;on of &s;trict honour and a gentleman; for though his fortune is (to be
&s;ure) &s;omewhat inferior to yours, and he &s;ubmits to <PB N="586" REF="161"> make him&s;elf convenient on &s;everal occa&s;ions, yet on that
account you are indebted to his infinite good-nature; and all his endeavours to
&s;erve you proceed from his great friend|&s;hip and regard for you. I remember
one of the&s;e friendly gentlemen, who carried his e&s;teem &s;o far, that in a
quarrel with his rich companion, in which he was favoured with &s;everal tweaks
by the no&s;e and kicks on the breech, he received all the&s;e injuries with
patience, and only &s;aid with tears in his eyes, 
<Q REND="inline">"Dear <HI>Jack,</HI> I never expected this
u&s;age from you. You know I don't mind fighting; but I &s;hould never have a
moment's peace, if I was to do you the lea&s;t injury. Come, <HI>Jack,</HI> let
us bu&s;s and be friends."</Q> Their gentility is unque&s;tionable, for they
are &s;eldom of any trade, though they are &s;ometimes (being younger-brothers
perhaps) of a profe&s;&s;ion. I know one, who is a nominal lawyer; but though
his friend has often fee'd him, our Coun&s;ellor could never with any propriety
con|&s;ider him as a client; and I know another, who (like <HI>Gibbet</HI> in
the play) is called Captain, who&s;e elegant manner of living mu&s;t be
&s;upported by his being on full pay with his patron, &s;ince he does not
receive even the common &s;oldier's groat a day from his commi&s;&s;ion.
However, con|&s;idering at one view the gentility of their profe&s;&s;ion, and
the &s;hortne&s;s of their finances, I often look on them as a band of decayed
gentlemen, the honourable pen&s;ioners of tho&s;e they follow. The great men
among the <HI>Romans</HI> had a number of the&s;e <HI>Hangers-on,</HI> which
attended them where-ever they went, and were emphatically called
<HI>Umbrae,</HI> or <HI>Shadows</HI>; and, indeed, this appellation conveys a
very full idea of the nature of the&s;e humble retainers to the wealthy,
&s;ince they not only follow them like their &s;hadows, but 
<Q REND="inline">"like a &s;hadow prove the &s;ub&s;tance
true:"</Q> for whenever <PB N="587" REF="162"> you ob&s;erve one or more of
the&s;e <HI>Umbrae</HI> perpetually at the heels of any gentleman, you may
fairly conclude him to be a man of fortune.</P>
<P>THESE faithful friends are &s;o careful of every thing that
concerns you, that they always enquire with the greate&s;t exactne&s;s into
your affairs, and know almo&s;t as well as your &s;teward the income of your
e&s;tate. They are al&s;o &s;o fond of your company, and &s;o de&s;irous of
pre&s;erving your good opi|nion, that a <HI>Hanger-on</HI> will take as much
pains to keep you entirely to him&s;elf, and to prevent a rival in your
af|fections, as a mi&s;tre&s;s: and as a convenient female is a very
nece&s;&s;ary part of the equipage of a per&s;on of fa&s;hion, the&s;e male
companions mu&s;t be a very agreeable part of the retinue of tho&s;e
high-&s;pirited young gentlemen, who are fond of being the head of their
company. It is only a more refined ta&s;te in expence to pay a man for laughing
at your wit, and in|dulging your humour: and who will either drink his bottle
with you at the tavern, or run to the end of the town for you on an errand.</P>
<P>I MIGHT al&s;o take notice of an humbler &s;ort of
<HI>Hangers-on,</HI> who fix them&s;elves to no one particular, but fa&s;ten
upon all their friends in their turns. Their views, indeed, are &s;eldom
extended beyond a pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and their utmo&s;t aim perhaps
is to get a dinner. For this purpo&s;e they keep a regi&s;ter of the hours of
dining of all their acquaintance; and though they contrive to call in upon you
ju&s;t as you are &s;itting down to table, they are always with much difficulty
prevailed upon to take a chair. If you dine abroad, or are gone into the
country, they will eat with your family to prevent their being melancholy on
account <PB N="588" REF="163"> of your ab&s;ence; or if your family is out,
they will break|fa&s;t, dine, and &s;up with you out of charity, becau&s;e you
&s;hould not be alone. Every hou&s;e is haunted with the&s;e di&s;turbers of
our meals: and perhaps the be&s;t way to get rid of them, would be to put them,
with the re&s;t of your &s;ervants, upon board-wages.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides the&s;e danglers after men of fortune, and
in|truders on your table in town, the country breeds a race of lowly retainers,
which may properly be ranked among the &s;ame &s;pecies. Almo&s;t every family
&s;upports a poor kin&s;man, who happening to be no way related to the
e&s;tate, was too proud of his blood to apply him&s;elf in his youth to any
profe&s;&s;ion, and rather cho&s;e to be &s;upported in lazine&s;s at the
family-&s;eat. They are, indeed, known perhaps to be cou|&s;ins to the
&s;quire, but do not appear in a more creditable light than his &s;ervants out
of livery; and &s;ometimes actually &s;ubmit to as mean offices of drudgery as
the groom or whipper-in. The whole fraternity of <HI>Hangers-on,</HI> whether
in town or country, or under whatever denomination, are the &s;ons of
idlene&s;s: for it will be found upon examina|tion, that whenever a man,
who&s;e bread depends on his indu&s;try, gives him&s;elf up to indolence, he
becomes capable of any meanne&s;s whatever: and if <HI>they cannot dig,</HI>
yet like our <HI>Hangers-on, to beg they are not a&s;hamed.</HI></P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I HAVE been &s;ome years married to one of the be&s;t women
in the world. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the virtues that can be named: but
alas! &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome of them to exce&s;s. Tho&s;e which I

<P>IT is a little difficult perhaps to a&s;certain what are, or
ought to be, the exact bounds of Good-nature; which, of all virtues, &s;eems to
me mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be confined, or at lea&s;t mitigated in &s;uch a
manner, as to hinder it from de|&s;troying <PB N="590" REF="165"> its own
excellence and utility. On the one hand, if it is re&s;trained too clo&s;e, the
world will &s;ay, that it mu&s;t entirely lo&s;e its e&s;&s;ence: But fatal
experience has convinced me, that if it is permitted to enjoy a full unlimited
&s;way, this amiable virtue becomes a ridiculous vice; and brings with it, as
in my wife's ca&s;e, fruitle&s;s expences, ill-judged conce&s;&s;ions, and a
kind of blind folly, that is always liable to contempt.</P>
<P>GENEROSITY is the daughter of Good-nature. She is very fair
and lovely when under the tuition of Judgment and Rea&s;on; but when &s;he
e&s;capes from her tutors, and acts in|di&s;criminately, according as her fancy
allures her, &s;he &s;ubjects her&s;elf, like her mother, to the bla&s;ts of
&s;neer, ridicule, and di&s;dain.</P>
<P>TO illu&s;trate the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions by &s;ome examples,
from among the many mi&s;haps, lo&s;&s;es, and embara&s;&s;ments, which have
accrued to us in the cour&s;e of our dome&s;tic affairs, give me leave to tell
you, that &s;ome years ago, we had a footboy who acted as butler, and had the
cu&s;tody of all the little plate which our &s;mall fortune could afford us.
The fellow was aukward, and unfit for the &s;tation; but my wife very
good-naturedly was determined to keep him in our &s;er|vice, becau&s;e he
intended to marry the nur&s;ery-maid, and would undoubtedly make an excellent
hu&s;band. The ra&s;cal was a thief; but as it is ill-natured to &s;u&s;pect
people, before we have full proof of their knavery, &s;everal of his tricks,
and petty larcenies, were attributed to the itinerant Jews and higlers (we then
living at <HI>Newington)</HI> who frequently called at our door. Flu&s;hed with
&s;ucce&s;s, and relying on my wife's credulity and Good-nature, he began to
form deeper de&s;igns; and (as he lay in the kitchen) pretended to have &s;een
a man breaking in at the window, and to have hid him&s;elf with a chopping
knife in his hand, &s;o as to have felled the villain to the ground as &s;oon
as he had put his body through the ca&s;e|ment. <PB N="591" REF="166"> A
noi&s;e from without was &s;aid to have given an alarm to the hou&s;ebreaker,
and to have interrupted him in his at|tempt; but &s;ome whole panes of gla&s;s
being di&s;located from their lead, and &s;ome hacks and &s;cratches of a
chi&s;el (marks all made by our own &s;ervant) being vi&s;ible next morning, my
wife very generou&s;ly <HI>rewarded</HI> her <HI>Jemmy,</HI> whom &s;he
jocularly called <HI>Scrub,</HI> for his diligence and courage in defending us
from having our throats cut. This terrible tale was doubtle&s;s formed in order
to remove all &s;u&s;picions, when he &s;hould pillage the hou&s;e him&s;elf;
but precautions being taken by us, in con&s;equence of this alarm, to fortify
our bed-chamber, where he knew our current trea&s;ure was repo&s;ited,
<HI>Jemmy</HI> thought it time to decamp; &s;o that in about a week after he
had received the reward, I hinted at, of a crown piece from his lady, he
&s;tole her gold repeating watch, and a pair of our be&s;t &s;ilver
candle&s;ticks, with which he voluntarily tran|&s;ported him&s;elf, as we have
been &s;ince told, to the <HI>We&s;t-In|dies,</HI> leaving his mi&s;tre&s;s the
nur&s;ery-maid, big with child, and thereby giving great licence to the
neighbourhood to animadvert upon my wife's amazing pre&s;cience in fore&s;eeing
his excellencies as an hu&s;band.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t further be told, Sir, that my dear con&s;ort, in
the full glow of her goodne&s;s, is never contented unle&s;s her &s;ervants
marry each other. All I can urge again&s;t &s;o impo|litic a cu&s;tom has been
to no purpo&s;e: Marriage (&s;he &s;ays) prevents vice, and &s;aves &s;ouls
from de&s;truction. Perhaps it may; but are no unmarried &s;ervants to be found
in Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI>'s Regi&s;ter Office, or el&s;ewhere, but what are
vicious? At lea&s;t I am &s;ure, that this piece of &s;anctity is very
expen&s;ive in its effects, and is attended with many inconve|niences. One of
her maids about two years ago was di&s;co|vered to be very intimate with my
footman; my wife, to prevent ill con&s;equences, ha&s;tened to have them
married, and was pre&s;ent her&s;elf at the ceremony. She admired the
mo|de&s;ty of the woman and the decent gravity of the man during 
<PB N="592" REF="167"> the holy rites, and &s;he was entirely convinced that no
harm could have happened from &s;o decent a couple. In little more than three
months after the marriage, <HI>Patty</HI> brought forth a &s;winging girl; but
as it was born almo&s;t &s;ix months before its time, my wife advi&s;ed them to
keep it the remain|ing half year in cotton. She did this purely from a motive
of good-nature, to try to &s;hield the new married woman's re|putation; but
finding our neighbours fleer at the incident, and &s;mile contemptuou&s;ly at
the pre&s;cription of cotton, &s;he contented her&s;elf in believing
<HI>Patty</HI>'s own account, that 
<Q REND="inline">"in truth &s;he had been married eight months
before by a <HI>Fleet-par&s;on,</HI> but was afraid to own it."</Q></P>
<P>BUT if my wife's indulging her dome&s;tics in matrimony was
productive of no other ill con&s;equence than merely their being married, it
might indeed &s;ometimes rather prove a bene|fit than a detriment: but the
cha&s;ter and more &s;ober they have been before marriage, the greater number
of children are pro|duced in matrimony; and my wife looks upon her&s;elf as in
duty obliged to take care of the poor helple&s;s offspring, that have been
begotten under her own roof; &s;o that I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, my hou&s;e is
&s;o well filled with children, that it would put you immediately in mind of
the <HI>Foundling Ho&s;|pital</HI>; with this difference however, that in
<HI>my Ho&s;pital</HI> not only the children are provided for, whether
ba&s;tards or legi|timate, but al&s;o the fathers and mothers.</P>
<P>YOUR high office, Mr. CENSOR, requires and leads you to hear
dome&s;tic occurrences, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould &s;carce have troubled you with
the records of a private family, almo&s;t ruined by excre&s;cencies of virtue.
The &s;ame overflowing humanity runs through the whole conduct of the dear
wo|man whom I have mentioned. Even in trifles &s;he is full of works of
&s;upererogation. Our doors are perpetually &s;ur|rounded with beggars, where
the halt, the maimed and the blind a&s;&s;emble in as great numbers, as at the
door of the <PB N="593" REF="168"> <HI>Roman</HI> Catholic Chapel in
<HI>Lincoln's Inn-Fields.</HI> She not only gives them money, but &s;ends them
out great quantities of bread, beer, and cold victuals; and &s;he has her
different <HI>pen&s;ioners</HI> (as &s;he her&s;elf calls them) for every day
in the week. But the expence attending the&s;e out-door petitioners (many of
whom have from time to time been di&s;covered to be im|po&s;tors) is nothing in
compari&s;on to the &s;ums that are almo&s;t daily drawn from her by begging
letters. It is impo&s;&s;ible to imagine a calamity, by which &s;he has not
been a &s;ufferer, in relieving tho&s;e who have extorted money from her, by
pretended misfortunes. The poor lady has been much hurt by lo&s;&s;es in trade,
has been a great &s;ufferer by fire, under|gone many hard&s;hips from
&s;ickne&s;s and other unfore&s;een ac|cidents, and it was but ye&s;terday that
&s;he paid a long apothe|cary's bill brought on by a violent fever. Thus, Sir,
though my wife goes into but little company, and the family-expences are to all
appearance very &s;mall, yet my wife's &s;uperabundant Good-nature is &s;uch
perpetual drawback on her oeconomy, that we run out con&s;iderably. This
extravagant and ill-judged Genero&s;ity renders all her numerous excellencies
of none effect: and I have often known her almo&s;t de&s;titute of cloaths,
becau&s;e &s;he had di&s;tributed her whole wardrobe among lyars, &s;ycophants,
and hypocrites.</P>
<P>THUS, Sir, as briefly as I can I have &s;et before you my
un|happy ca&s;e. I am peri&s;hing by degrees, not by any real extravagance, any
de&s;igned ruin, or any indulgence of luxury and riot in the per&s;on who
de&s;troys me. On the contrary, no woman can exceed my wife in the &s;implicity
of her dre&s;s, the humility of her de&s;ires, or the contented ea&s;ine&s;s of
her nature. What name, Sir, &s;hall I give to my misfortunes? They proceed not
from vice, nor even from folly: they proceed from too tender a heart; a heart
that hurries away, or ab&s;orbs all judgment and reflection. To call the&s;e
errors the fruits of Good-nature is too mild a definition: 
<PB N="594" REF="169"> and yet to give them an har&s;her appellation, is
unkind. Let me &s;uffer what I will, I mu&s;t ki&s;s the dear hand that ruins
me.</P>
<P>IN my tender hours of &s;peculation I would willingly im|pute
my wife's faults to our climate, and the natural di&s;|po&s;ition of our
natives. When the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are Good-natured, they are generally &s;o
to exce&s;s: and as I have not &s;een this particular character delineated in
any of your papers, I have endeavoured to paint it my&s;elf: and &s;hall draw
to the conclu&s;ion of my letter by one piece of ad|vice, <HI>Not to be</HI>
GENEROUS <HI>overmuch.</HI> The highe&s;t acts of Genero&s;ity are &s;eldom
repaid in any other coin, but ba&s;e|ne&s;s and ingratitude: and we ought ever
to remember, that out of ten lepers cleaned, one only came back to return
thanks; the re&s;t were made whole, and went their way.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AT this &s;ea&s;on of the year, while the &s;treets re&s;ound
with the cry of <HI>New Almanacks,</HI> and every &s;tall is covered with News
from the Stars, Diaries, Predictions, Complete Ephemeris, &amp;c. drawn up by
<HI>Partridge, Parker, Vincent Wing,</HI> and the re&s;t of the &s;agacious
body of Philomaths and A&s;trologers, give me leave to acquaint you of my
intentions of appearing annually in a like capacity. You mu&s;t know, Sir, that
having ob&s;erved, that among the great variety of Almanacks now publi&s;hed,
there is not one contrived for the u&s;e of people of fa&s;hion, I have
re&s;olved to remedy this defect by publi&s;hing one every year 
<PB N="596" REF="171"> under the title of the <HI>Court Calendar,</HI>
calculated for the Meridian of St. <HI>James</HI>'s.</P>
<P>THE plan, which has been hitherto followed by our
Almanack-makers, can be of no u&s;e whatever to the polite world, who are as
widely &s;eparated in their manner of living from the common herd of people as
the inhabitants of the <HI>Antipodes.</HI> To know the exact Ri&s;ing and
Setting of the Sun may &s;erve to direct the vulgar trade&s;man and mechanic
when to open &s;hop or go to work: but per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, who&s;e hours
are not marked by the cour&s;e of that planet, are indifferent about its
motions; and like tho&s;e who live under the Equinoctial Line, have their days
and nights of an equal degree of length all the year round. The Red-letter days
pointed out in our common Almanacks may perhaps be ob&s;erved by &s;ome formal
ladies, who regulate their going to church by them: but people of quality
percieve no difference between the Moveable or Immoveable Fea&s;ts and Fa&s;ts,
and know no u&s;e of Sunday, but as it &s;erves to call them to the card-table.
What advantage can a beau reap from <HI>Rider</HI>'s Li&s;t of the Fairs, which
can only be of &s;ervice to his groom? or what u&s;e can any gentleman or lady
make of tho&s;e Diaries now in&s;cribed to them; which are filled with Algebra
and the Mathematics? In a word, the pre&s;ent uncouth way of dividing the
months into Saints Days, Sundays, and the like, is no more adapted to the
pre&s;ent modes of polite life, than the <HI>Roman</HI> divi&s;ion into
<HI>Ides, Nones,</HI> and <HI>Calends.</HI></P>
<P>INSTEAD of &s;uppo&s;ing, with the vulgar tribe of
a&s;tro|nomers, that the day begins at &s;unri&s;e, my day, which will commence
at the time that it u&s;ually breaks in fa&s;hion|able <PB N="597" REF="172">
apartments, will be determined by the Ri&s;ing of people of quality. Thus the
morning dawns with early ri&s;ers be|tween eleven and twelve; and noon
commences at four, when, at this time of the year, the dinner and wax-lights
come in together. For want of a thorough knowledge of the di&s;tribution of the
day, all who have any connection with the polite world might be guilty of many
mi&s;takes: and when an hone&s;t man from <HI>Cornhill</HI> intended a nobleman
a vi&s;it after dinner, he would perhaps find him &s;ipping his morning
chocolate. The inconveniences of the old &s;tyle in our manner of reckoning the
days were &s;o manife&s;t, that it was thought proper to amend them by act of
parli|ament. I am re&s;olved in like manner, to introduce the new &s;tyle of
dividing the hours al&s;o into my Almanack: for can any thing be more ab&s;urd
than to fix the name of morning, noon, and evening, &amp;c. at pre&s;ent on the
&s;ame hours, which bore them in the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth?</HI> A
Dutche&s;s is &s;o far from dining at eleven, that it often happens that Her
Grace has not then opened her eyes on the tea-table; and a Maid of Honour would
no more ri&s;e at five or &s;ix in the morning, as it was called by the early
dames of Queen <HI>Be&s;s</HI>'s court, than &s;he would, in imitation of
tho&s;e dames, breakfa&s;t upon &s;trong beer and beef-&s;teaks. Indeed in
tho&s;e hou&s;es, where the hours of quality are ob&s;erved by only one part of
the family, the impolite irre|gularity of the other, in adhering to the old
&s;tyle, occa|&s;ions great di&s;turbance, for as Lady <HI>Townly</HI> &s;ays, 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;uch a hou&s;e is wor&s;e than an inn with
ten &s;tage coaches. What between the impertinent people of bu&s;ine&s;s in a
morning, and the intolerable thick &s;hoes of footmen at noon, one has not a
wink of &s;leep all night."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="598" REF="173">THE reformation which I have al&s;o made
in re&s;pect to the Red-letter-days is no le&s;s con&s;iderable. I have not
only wiped away that immen&s;e catalogue of Saints which croud the
<HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Calendar, but have al&s;o blotted out all the other Saints
that &s;till retain their places in our common Alma|macks: well-knowing that
per&s;ons of fa&s;hion pay as little attention to the Apo&s;tles and
Evangeli&s;ts, as to St. <HI>Mildred,</HI> St. <HI>Bridget,</HI> or St.
<HI>Winifred.</HI> Indeed I retain the old name of St. <HI>John,</HI> becau&s;e
I am &s;ure, that people of quality will not think of any body's being
de&s;igned under that title, except the late Lord <HI>Bolingbroke.</HI> Having
thus di&s;carded the Saints, <HI>people whom nobody knows,</HI> I have taken
care to introduce my readers into the be&s;t company: for the Red-Letters in my
Calendar will &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e days on which the ladies of
the fir&s;t fa&s;hion keep their routes and vi&s;iting days: a work of infinite
u&s;e as well to the per&s;ons of di&s;tinction them&s;elves, as to all tho&s;e
who have any occa|&s;ional intercour&s;e with the polite world. That &s;ea&s;on
of the year commonly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of <HI>Lent,</HI>
which implies a time of fa&s;ting, I &s;hall con&s;ider, according to its real
&s;ignification in the <HI>Beau Monde,</HI> as a yearly <HI>fe&s;ti|val</HI>;
and &s;hall therefore mention it under the denomination of <HI>The
Carnival.</HI> The propriety of this will be evident at fir&s;t &s;ight,
&s;ince nothing is &s;o plain, as that at this &s;ea&s;on all kinds of
diver&s;ion and jollity are at the height in this metro|polis. In&s;tead of the
<HI>Man in the Almanack,</HI> I at fir&s;t in|tended (in imitation of Mr.
<HI>Dod&s;ley</HI>'s Memorandum Book) to delineate the figure of a fine
gentleman dre&s;t <HI>&agrave; la mode:</HI> but I was at length determined, by
the advice of &s;ome inge|nious friends, to &s;uffer the old picture to remain
there; &s;ince as it appears to be run through the body in &s;everal places, it
may not improperly repre&s;ent that fa&s;hionable character a Duelli&s;t.</P>
<P>IN the place which is allotted in other Almanacks for the
change of weather, (as hail, fro&s;t, &s;now, cloudy, and <PB N="599" REF="174"> the like) I &s;hall &s;et down the change of dre&s;s, adapted to
different &s;ea&s;ons, and ranged under the titles of hats, capu|chins,
cardinals, &s;acks, negligees, gau&s;e handkerchiefs, ermine tippets, muffs,
&amp;c. and in a parallel column (according to the cu&s;tom of other Almanacks)
I &s;hall point out the &s;everal parts of the body, affected by the&s;e
changes; &s;uch as head, neck, brea&s;t, &s;houlders, face, hands, feet, legs,
&amp;c. And as Mr. <HI>Rider</HI> accompanies every month with &s;ea&s;onable
cau|tions about &s;owing turnips, rai&s;ing cabbages, blood-letting, and &s;uch
other important articles, I &s;hall give &s;uch direc|tions, as are mo&s;t
&s;uitable to the beau-monde: as a &s;pecimen of which I &s;hall beg leave to
lay before you the following Ob&s;ervations on the month of May.</P>
<Q> 
<P>IF the &s;ea&s;on proves favourable, it will be proper at the
beginning of this month to attend to the cultivation of your public gardens.
Trim your trees, put your walks in order, look after your lamps, have ballads
written, and &s;et to mu&s;ic, for the en&s;uing &s;ummer. Ladies and gentlemen
mu&s;t be careful not to catch cold in cro&s;&s;ing the water, or by
expo|&s;ing them&s;elves to the damp air in the dark walk at
<HI>Vaux-hall.</HI></P> 
<P>Towards the middle of this month the air at both play|hou&s;es
will begin to be too clo&s;e and &s;ultry for ladies, that paint, to ri&s;k the
lo&s;s of their complexion in them.</P> 
<P>About the end of this month it will be expedient for tho&s;e
ladies, who are apt to be hy&s;terical when the town empties, to prepare for
their removal to <HI>Tunbridge, Cheltenham,</HI> and <HI>Scarborough,</HI> for
the benefit of the waters.</P> </Q>

<P>&dtristar;I did not think of ever mentioning the old woman who

letter by the penny-po&s;t, I cannot &s;o far affront the young lady, by whom

<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my Aunt <HI>Singleton</HI> has publickly given her
honour, that &s;he will never read any of your future papers, I think I may
venture to &s;end you a letter without fear of her di&s;covery: an incident,
which might per|haps be of cruel con&s;equence to me, as I know &s;he can never
forgive. I am not under any apprehen&s;ions of being betrayed by her friends.
She has but few, and tho&s;e are a &s;ort that rather chu&s;e to &s;ooth her
weakne&s;&s;es than to rai&s;e her choler; not knowing whether, in her hours of
peevi&s;hne&s;s, &s;ome of her bile may not fall upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I OWN I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to find my name in print, and
to &s;ee my picture drawn at full length. I ob&s;erve that my guardian Aunt,
like all painters whether male or female, has dipped her pencil in the colours
of flattery: and accordingly &s;he has drawn me, if not entirely perfect, at
lea&s;t only with &s;uch faults, as are rather commendable, than otherwi&s;e. 
<Q REND="inline">"A &s;i|lence in company, and too much
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to judgments not &s;o good as my own,"</Q> are failings
natural to my youth and want of experience, which time, and an introduction
into proper company, very different from &s;uch as I &s;ee at my Aunt's
tea-table, will &s;oon cure: but I am &s;till con|&s;cious that neither the
progre&s;s of time, the gifts of fortune, nor the &s;ucce&s;s of improvement,
can render me, what &s;he has already painted me, 
<Q> 
<L>A faultle&s;s mon&s;ter whom the world ne'er
&s;aw.</L></Q></P>
<P>SHE affirms, 
<Q REND="inline">"that I &s;ing and play to great
perfection."</Q> Upon my word, Sir, I have no voice. She teizes me &s;ometimes
to &s;quall forth a Solo, and I obey, becau&s;e as &s;he ju&s;tly tells you, 
<Q REND="inline">"I tremble at her look,"</Q> which, if it
had the family power of one of her antient ance&s;tors, mu&s;t long &s;ince
have turned me into &s;tone. But what is the effect of my &s;ong? Alas it
generally proves, only an incantation to rou&s;e the lapd-og out of a &s;ound
&s;leep upon his cu&s;hion, or to &s;et the parrot and the mackaw into a chorus
of &s;creaming, that would if po&s;&s;ible, awaken our neighbours the dead, in
<HI>St. Giles's Church Yard.</HI></P>
<P>SHE hints, that 
<Q REND="inline">"I am in love with a certain military
Gentleman of no fortune,"</Q> and &s;he adds that 
<Q REND="inline">"he is mode&s;t, brave, &s;tudious, and
polite."</Q> That an officer comes often to our hou&s;e is &s;trictly true.
That he has no fortune is no le&s;s &s;o. But that I am in love with him is
ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, nor are his vi&s;its to me. They are to my Aunt, whom he
certainly 
<Q REND="inline">"would prefer to any dowager whatever
without a jointure;"</Q> and who, to my knowledge, would be highly plea&s;ed,
notwith&s;tanding her family pride, to change the name of <HI>Singleton</HI>
into <HI>O-Kelly.</HI></P>
<P>THIS leads me to let you into the real cau&s;e, why &s;he
prefers <HI>The</HI> WORLD to all other weekly e&s;&s;ays whatever. The
partiality does not ari&s;e from the merit of the performance in general, but
from the &s;ubject of one parti|cular paper, (N^o. 28.) which con&s;tantly lies
upon her table, hid under the work-ba&s;ket, and which &s;trongly recommends by
various precepts and ex|amples the admiration and love of OLD WOMEN.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I AM one of tho&s;e idle people, (of whom you have lately
given an account) who not being bred to any bu&s;ine&s;s, or able to get a
livelihood by work, have taken up the more &s;ervile trade of an
<HI>Hanger-on.</HI></P>
<P>I FIRST &s;erved my time with an old nobleman in the country;
and as I was a di&s;tant relation of his lord&s;hip's, I was 
<PB N="602" REF="177"> admitted to the honour of attending him in the double
ca|pacity of valet, and apothecary. My bu&s;ine&s;s in a morn|ing was to wait
on him at dre&s;&s;ing time; to hold the ba&s;on while he wa&s;hed his hands,
buckle his &s;hoes, and tye on his neck-cloth. Be&s;ides this, his lord&s;hip
had &s;uch a regard for me, that nobody but my&s;elf was ever tru&s;ted with
cut|ting his corns, or paring his toe-nails: and whenever he was &s;ick, it was
always my office to hold his head during the operation of an emetic, to attend
him in the water-clo&s;et when he took a cathartic, and &s;ometimes to
admini&s;ter a cly&s;ter. If his lord&s;hip had no company, I was, indeed,
permitted to &s;it at table with him: but when he received any vi&s;iters more
grand than ordinary, I was equipped (toge|ther with &s;ome of the
be&s;t-looking tenants) in a tye-wig, full-trimmed coat and laced-wai&s;tcoat,
in order to &s;well the retinue of his &s;ervants out of livery. I bore my
&s;lavery with the greate&s;t degree of patience; as my lord would often hint
to me, that I was provided for in his will. However, I had the mortification to
find my&s;elf &s;upplanted in his good graces by the Chaplain, who had always
looked upon me as his rival, and contrived at length to out-wheedle, out-fawn,
and out-cringe me. In a word, my lord died:&mdash;and while the Chaplain (who
con&s;tantly prayed by him du|ring his la&s;t illne&s;s) had the con&s;olation
of having a good benefice &s;ecured to him in the will, my name was huddled
among tho&s;e of the common &s;ervants, with no higher le|gacy than twenty
guineas to buy mourning.</P>
<P>WITH this &s;mall pittance (be&s;ides what I had made a
&s;hift to &s;queeze out of the tenants and trade&s;men, as fees for my good
word, when I had his lord&s;hip's ear) I came up to town; and embarked all I
was worth in fitting my|&s;elf <PB N="603" REF="178"> out as a gentleman. Soon
after, as good luck would have it, the nephew and heir of my old lord came from
abroad: when I contrived to wind me into his favour by abu&s;ing his decea&s;ed
uncle, and fattened my|&s;elf upon him. It is true, he &s;upported me; admitted
me into an equal &s;hare of his pur&s;e: but con&s;idering the dan|gers to
which I was con&s;tantly expo&s;ed on his account, I regarded his bounties as
only plai&s;ters to my &s;ores. My head, back and ribs have received many a
payment, which &s;hould have been placed to his lord&s;hip's account: and I
once narrowly e&s;caped being hanged for murdering a poor fellow, whom my lord
in a frolick had run through the body. My patron, among other marks of his
ta&s;te, kept a mi&s;|tre&s;s; and I, as his particular crony and a man of
honour, was allowed to vi&s;it her. It happened one evening he un|luckily
&s;urpri&s;ed us in &s;ome unguarded familiarities together. But my lord was
&s;o far from being enraged at it, that he only turned madam out of the room,
and very coolly kicked me down &s;tairs after her.</P>
<P>I WAS now thrown upon the wide world again: but as I never
wanted a&s;&s;urance, I &s;oon made my&s;elf very familiarly acquainted with a
young gentleman from <HI>Ireland,</HI> who was ju&s;t come over to
<HI>England</HI> to &s;pend his e&s;tate here. I mu&s;t own, I had &s;ome
difficulty in keeping on good terms with this new friend; as I had &s;o many of
his own countrymen to contend with, who all claimed a right of acquaintance
with him, and &s;ome of them even pretended to be related to him. Be&s;ides,
they all per&s;uaded the young &s;quire, that they had fortunes in different
parts of <HI>Ireland</HI>; though not one of them had any real e&s;tate any
more than my&s;elf: though, indeed, I al&s;o had a nominal 1500<HI>l. per
Ann.</HI> in <PB N="604" REF="179"> the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> The&s;e furious
fellows (for, Sir, they would all fight) gave me much trouble: however, I found
out my young friend's foible, and in &s;pite of his countrymen became his
in&s;eparable companion. He was not only very fond of women, but had a
particular pa&s;&s;ion for new faces; and to humour this inclination, I was
perpetually on the look-out to di&s;cover fre&s;h pieces for him. I brought him
mantua-makers, milliners, and &s;ervant-maids in abundance; and at length grew
&s;o great a favourite by having prevailed on one of my own cou&s;ins to comply
with his propo&s;als, that I verily believe he would &s;oon have made me ea&s;y
for life in an hand&s;ome annuity, if he had not been unfortunately run through
the body in a duel by one of his own countrymen.</P>
<P>I NEXT got into favour with an old colonel of the guards, who
happened to take a fancy to me one evening at the <HI>Tilt Yard</HI>
coffee-hou&s;e, for having carried off a pint bumper more than a lieutenant of
a man of war, that had challenged my toa&s;t. As his &s;ole delight was
centered in the bottle, all he required of me was to drink gla&s;s for gla&s;s
with him; which I readily complied with, as he always paid my reckon|ing. When
&s;ober he was the be&s;t-humoured man in the world: but he was very apt to be
quarrel&s;ome and extremely mi&s;chievous when in liquor. He has more than once
flung a bottle at my head, and emptied the contents of a bowl of punch in my
face: &s;ometimes he has diverted him&s;elf by &s;etting fire to my ruffles,
&s;haking the a&s;hes of his pipe over my perriwig, or making a thru&s;t at me
with the red-hot poker: and I remember he once &s;ou&s;ed me all over with the
urine of the whole company, by clapping a large pewter Jordan top&s;y-turvy
upon my head. All the&s;e indignities <PB N="605" REF="180"> I very patiently
put up with, as he was &s;ure to make me double amends for them the next
morning: and I was very near procuring a commi&s;&s;ion in the army through his
intere&s;t, when to my great di&s;appointment he was &s;uddenly carried off by
an apoplexy.</P>
<P>YOU will be &s;urpri&s;ed when I tell you, that I next
con|trived to &s;queeze my&s;elf into the good opinion of a rich old
curmudgeon, a city-merchant, and one of the circumci&s;ed. He could have no
objection to my religion, as I u&s;ed to &s;pend every Sunday with him at his
country-hou&s;e, where I pre|ferred playing at cards to going to church. Nor
could I, indeed, get any thing out of him beyond a dinner: but I had higher
points in view. As he had nobody to inherit his fortune but an only daughter,
(who was kept always in the country) I became &s;o de&s;perately in love with
her, that I would even have turned <HI>Jew</HI> to obtain her. In&s;tead of
that, I very fooli&s;hly made a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> of her, and we were
privately married at the <HI>Fleet.</HI> When I came to break the matter to the
father, and to make an apology for having converted her, he received me with a
loud laugh. 
<Q REND="inline">"Sir, &s;ays he, if my child had married the
DEVIL, he &s;hould have had every penny that was her due. But&mdash;as &s;he is
only my Ba&s;tard, the law cannot oblige me to give her a farthing."</Q></P>
<P>THIS I found to be too true: and very happily for me my
<HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> wife had &s;o little regard for her new religion, that
&s;he again became an apo&s;tate, and was taken into keep|ing (to which I
readily gave my con&s;ent) by one of her own tribe and complexion. I &s;hall
not tire you with a particular detail of what has happened to me &s;ince: I
&s;hall only ac|quaint <PB N="606" REF="181"> you, that I have exactly followed
the precept of 
<Q REND="inline">"becoming all things to all men."</Q> I was
once &s;upported very &s;plendidly by a young rake of quality for my wit in
talking bla&s;phemy and ridiculing the bible, till my patron &s;hot him&s;elf
through the head: and I lived at bed and board with an old Methodi&s;t lady for
near a twelve-month on ac|count of my zeal for the New Doctrine, till one of
the maid-&s;ervants wickedly laid a child to me. At pre&s;ent, Mr. TOWN, I am
quite out of employ; having ju&s;t lo&s;t a very profitable place, which I held
under a great man in quality of his Pimp. My di&s;grace was owing to the
ba&s;ene&s;s of an old <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> acquaintance, whom I palmed upon
his honour for an innocent creature ju&s;t come out of the coun|try: but the
hu&s;&s;y was &s;o ungrateful, as to be&s;tow on both of us convincing marks of
her thorough knowledge of the town.</P>

<P>_AS the appointed time of our publication now happens to fall on
New-year's-day, I cannot open the bu&s;ine&s;s of the year with a better grace,
than by taking the pre&s;ent hour for the &s;ubject of this paper: a &s;ubject,
which plea&s;es me the more, as it al&s;o gives me an opportunity of paying my
readers the compliments of the &s;ea&s;on, and mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;hing
them all <HI>a happy new year, and a great many of them.</HI> But in order to
make the&s;e civilities of more con&s;equence than a bare compliment, I will
al&s;o endeavour to give them a little <PB N="608" REF="183"> whole&s;ome
advice, by which they may be mo&s;t likely to en&s;ure to them&s;elves that
happine&s;s, and to go through the en&s;uing year with ea&s;e and
tranquility.</P>
<P>No God in the heathen <HI>Pantheon</HI> was expre&s;&s;ed by
properer emblems, or more &s;ignificantly repre&s;ented, than <HI>Janus,</HI>
whom we may fairly &s;tile, in our language, the God of the New Year. The
medals on which the image of this Deity was engraved bore two faces, not ogling
each other like tho&s;e on the &s;hillings of <HI>Philip</HI> and
<HI>Mary,</HI> nor cheek by jowl like the double vi&s;age on the coin of
<HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> but turned from each other, one looking
forwards, as it were, into futurity, and the other taking a retro&s;pective
view of what was pa&s;t. There can|not &s;urely be devi&s;ed a &s;tronger, or
more &s;en&s;ible le&s;&s;on of moral in&s;truction, than this figure teaches
us. This double view comprehends in it&s;elf the &s;um of human prudence; for
the mo&s;t perfect rea&s;on can go no higher than wi&s;ely to gue&s;s at the
future, by reflecting on the pa&s;t; and morality is never &s;o likely to
per&s;evere in a &s;teady and uniform cour&s;e, as when it &s;ets out with a
fix'd determination of mutually regulating the New Year by a recollection of
the Old, and at the &s;ame time making the &s;ucceeding a critique on the
la&s;t.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the faults in the general conduct of mankind, and
their frequent mi&s;carriages in their mo&s;t favourite en|terprizes, will be
found, upon examination, to re&s;ult from an imperfect and partial view of what
relates to their duty or undertakings. Some regulate their actions by blind
gue&s;s, and ra&s;hly pre&s;uming on the future, without the lea&s;t attention
to the pa&s;t. With the&s;e the impe|tuo&s;ity of the pa&s;&s;ions gives their
rea&s;on no &s;cope to exert it&s;elf, but, neglecting the premi&s;es, they
jump to a con|clusion. Others, who are often taken for men of deep 
<PB N="609" REF="184"> reflection and marvellous under&s;tanding, meditate &s;o
profoundly on the pa&s;t, that they &s;carce take any notice either of the
pre&s;ent or the future. To the&s;e two cha|racters, who&s;e mi&s;conduct
ari&s;es from two &s;uch contrary &s;ources, may indeed be added a third,
who&s;e wild irre|gular behaviour is founded on no fix'd principles, but
proceeds from a total ab&s;ence of thought and reflection. The&s;e ea&s;y
creatures act entirely at random, neither troubling them&s;elves with what has
been, what is, or what will be; and, as the image of <HI>Janus</HI> &s;eems to
bear two heads, the&s;e thoughtle&s;s vacant animals may almo&s;t be &s;aid to
have no head at all.</P>
<P>But that the nece&s;&s;ity of taking this comprehensive view of
our affairs may appear in the &s;tronger light, let us con&s;ider the many
difficulties in which men of any of the above characters are involved from a
total neglect or partial &s;urvey of matters that &s;hould influence their
conduct. The fir&s;t &s;ort of men, who nouri&s;h great expectations from the
future, and &s;uffer hope to lay their prudence to &s;leep, are very common:
Indeed almo&s;t every man, like the dairy-maid with her pail of milk, plea&s;es
him&s;elf with calculating the advantages he &s;hall reap from his
undertakings. There is &s;carce a &s;ervitor at either univer&s;ity, who, when
he takes orders, does not think it more than po&s;&s;ible he may one day be a
bi&s;hop, or at lea&s;t head of a college, though perhaps at fir&s;t he is glad
to &s;nap at a curacy. Every walking attendant on our ho&s;pitals flatters
him&s;elf that a few years will &s;ettle him in high practice and a chariot:
and among tho&s;e few gentlemen of the inns of court, who really de&s;erve the
name of &s;tudents, there is hardly one who &s;its down to Lord <HI>Coke</HI>
without imagining that he may him&s;elf, &s;ome time or other, be Lord
Chancellor. At this early period <PB N="610" REF="185"> of life the&s;e vain
hopes may perhaps &s;erve as &s;purs to dili|gence and virtue; but what &s;hall
we &s;ay to tho&s;e people, who in &s;pite of experience and repeated
di&s;appointments, &s;till place their chief dependance on groundle&s;s
expecta|tions from their future fortune? This Town &s;warms with people who
rely almo&s;t &s;olely on contingencies: and our goals are often filled with
wretches who brought on their own poverty and misfortunes, by promi&s;ing
them&s;elves great profit from &s;ome darling &s;cheme, which has at la&s;t
been attended with bankruptcy. The pre&s;ent extra|vagance of many of our
&s;pend-thrifts is built on &s;ome ideal riches of which they are &s;oon to be
in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; and which they are laying out as freely, as the girl in
the farce &s;quanders the ten thou&s;and pounds &s;he was to get in the
lottery. I am my&s;elf acquainted with a young fellow who had great
expectations from an old uncle. He had ten thou&s;and pounds of his own in
ready money; and as the old gentleman was a good deal turned of &s;ixty, the
nephew very con&s;iderately computed, that his uncle could hardly la&s;t above
five years, during which time he might go on very genteely at the rate of
2000<HI>l. per ann.</HI> However the old gentleman held toge|ther above &s;even
years, the two la&s;t of which our young &s;park had no con&s;olation but the
daily hopes of his uncle's death. The happy hour at length arrived; the will
was tore open with rapture; when, alas! the fond youth di&s;covered, that he
had never once reflected, that though he had a ticket in the wheel, it might
po&s;&s;ibly come up a blank, and had the mortification to find him&s;elf
disin|herited.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not dwell &s;o particularly on the ridiculous folly of
tho&s;e profound &s;peculati&s;ts, who fix their attention en|tirely on what is
pa&s;t, without making their reflections of &s;ervice either for the pre&s;ent
or the future, becau&s;e it is not a very common or tempting &s;pecies of
ab&s;urdity: <PB N="611" REF="186"> but &s;hall rather advi&s;e the reader to
con&s;ider the time pa&s;t, as the &s;chool of experience, from which he may
draw the mo&s;t u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons for his future conduct. This kind of
retro&s;pect would teach us to provide with fore|&s;ight again&s;t the
calamities to which our inexperience has hitherto expo&s;ed us, though at the
&s;ame time it would not throw us &s;o far back, as to keep us lagging, like
the Old Stile, behind the re&s;t of the world. To &s;ay the truth, tho&s;e
&s;age per&s;ons who are given to &s;uch deep re|flection, as to let to-day and
to-morrow pa&s;s unregarded by meditating on ye&s;terday, are as ridiculous in
their con|duct, as country beaux in their dre&s;s, who adopt the town modes,
ju&s;t after they are become unfa&s;hionable in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>But there is no ta&s;k &s;o difficult as to infu&s;e ideas into
a brain hitherto entirely unaccu&s;tomed to thinking: for how can we warn a man
to avoid the misfortunes which may hereafter befal him, or to improve by the
calamities he has already &s;uffered, who&s;e actions are not the re&s;ult of
thought, or guided by experience? The&s;e per&s;ons are, indeed, of all others,
the mo&s;t to be pitied. They are prodigal and abandoned in their conduct, and
by vi|cious exce&s;&s;es ruin their con&s;titution, till at length poverty and
death &s;tare them in the face together; or if, unfortu|nately, their crazy
frame holds together after the utter de&s;truction of their fortune, they
fini&s;h a thoughtle&s;s life by an act of de&s;peration, and a pi&s;tol puts
an end to their mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>Since then good fortune cannot be expected to fall into our
laps, and it requires &s;ome thought to en&s;ure to our|&s;elves a likelihood
of &s;ucce&s;s in our undertakings, let us look back with attention on the old
year, and gather in&s;truc|tions from it in what manner to conduct our&s;elves
through <PB N="612" REF="187"> the New. Let us al&s;o endeavour to draw from it
a le&s;&s;on of morality: and I hope it will not be thought too &s;olemn a
conclu&s;ion of this paper, if I advi&s;e my readers to carry this reflection
even into religion. This train of thought, that teaches us at once to reflect
on the pa&s;t, and look forward to the future, will al&s;o naturally lead us to
look up with awe and admiration towards that Being who has exi&s;ted from all
eternity, and &s;hall exi&s;t world with|out end. No idea can give us a more
exalted idea of the Power who fir&s;t created us, and who&s;e providence is
always over us. Let us then con&s;ider with attention this pagan image, by
which we may add force to our morality, and prudence to our ordinary conduct;
nor let us blu&s;h to receive a le&s;&s;on from Heathens, which may animate our
zeal and reverence for the Author of Chri&s;tianity.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT has been my good fortune to be born of a family, that is
recorded in the Herald's Dictionary, as one of the mo&s;t antient in the
kingdom: We are &s;uppo&s;ed to have come into <HI>England</HI> with
<HI>William</HI> the Con|queror. Upon my acce&s;&s;ion &s;ome years ago to my
elder brother's e&s;tate and title of a Baronet, I received a vi&s;it from
<HI>Rouge Dragon,</HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Pur&s;uivant at Arms, to congratulate
me upon my new rank of a <HI>Vava&s;our,</HI> and to know whether I &s;hould
chu&s;e to bear the <HI>dexter ba&s;e points of the Lady I&s;a|bel's Saltire in
chief,</HI> or only her <HI>Sini&s;ter corners</HI>; &s;he being one of the
&s;eventeen coheire&s;&s;es of my great great great <PB N="614" REF="189">
great great grandfather's fourth wife <HI>Dorothy,</HI> the daughter and &s;ole
heire&s;s of <HI>Simon de la Frogpool</HI> of <HI>Croakham</HI> in
<HI>Suf|folk.</HI> This unexpected vi&s;it mu&s;t have di&s;concerted me to an
invincible degree, if upon recollection I had not only re|membered Mr.
<HI>Rouge Dragon</HI> as a con&s;tant companion to my late brother, but as a
kind of tutor in initiating him into the Science of Heraldy, and the Civil and
Military Atchievements, to which our nobility and gentry are entitled. As
&s;oon, therefore, as I could recover my&s;elf from my fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e in
hearing an unknown <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> language, I hum|bly thanked Mr.
<HI>Dragon</HI> for the pains he had taken in con|&s;idering my Coat of Arms
&s;o minutely, but hoped he would give him&s;elf no farther trouble upon my
account: becau&s;e I was fully determined to <HI>bear</HI> the plain
<HI>Shield</HI> of my grand|father Sir <HI>Peter,</HI> without taking the
lea&s;t notice of Lady <HI>I&s;abel's Saltire in chief,</HI> or even of her
<HI>Sini&s;ter corners.</HI></P>
<P>BE it to my &s;hame or not, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that Heraldry
is a &s;cience, which I have never much cultivated: nor do I find it very
prevalent among the fa&s;hionable &s;tudies of the age. Arms, and Armorial
tokens, may, I &s;uppo&s;e, be regu|larly di&s;tingui&s;hed, and properly
emblazoned, upon the family plate to which they belong: but I have ob&s;erved
of late, that the&s;e honorable en&s;igns are not confined entirely to their
proper owners, but are u&s;urped by every body, who thinks fit to take them;
in&s;omuch that there is &s;carce an hackney coach in <HI>London,</HI> which is
not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Ducal Cre&s;t, an Earl's Coronet, or a Baronet's
Bloody Hand. This has often given me great offence, as it reflects a &s;candal
on our nobility and gentry: and I cannot but think it very indecent for a
Duke's coach to be &s;een waiting at a night-cellar while the coach|man 
<PB N="615" REF="190"> is tipping off a gla&s;s of gin, or for a Counte&s;s's
landau to &s;et down ladies at the door of a common bawdy-hou&s;e. I remember I
was one morning di&s;turbed at my breakfa&s;t by a fa&s;hionable rap at my
door; when looking out of my window I &s;aw the coach of the lady dowager
&mdash; drawn up before it. I was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;o early and
un|expected a vi&s;it from her lady&s;hip; and while I was pre|paring to
receive her, I over-heard her lady&s;hip at high words with her coachman in my
entry; when &s;tepping to the &s;tair-ca&s;e I found that they were
&s;quabbling together about &s;ixpence, and &s;oon perceived that her
lady&s;hip was dwindled into one of my hou&s;e-maids. This badge of nobility,
a&s;&s;u|med at random according to the fancy of the coach-painter, I have
found inconvenient on other occa&s;ions: for I once travelled from
<HI>London</HI> to <HI>Derby</HI> in an hired chariot finely or|namented with a
Vi&s;count's cypher and coronet; by which noble circum&s;tance I was compelled
in every inn to pay as a Lord, though I was not at that time even a &s;imple
Baronet, or (in the language of my friend Mr. <HI>Dragon)</HI> arrived to the
dignity of a <HI>Vava&s;our.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE, indeed, &s;ometimes doubted, whether nobility and high
rank are of that real advantage, which they are generally e&s;teemed to be: and
I am almo&s;t inclined to think, that they an&s;wer no other de&s;irable end,
than as far as they indulge our vanity and o&s;tentation. A long roll of
ennobled ance&s;tors makes, I confe&s;s, a very alluring appearance: To &s;ee
coronet after coronet pa&s;&s;ing before our view in an uninterrupted
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is the mo&s;t &s;oothing pro&s;pect, that perhaps can
pre&s;ent it&s;elf to the eye of human pride: The exaltation that we feel upon
&s;uch a review takes ri&s;e in a vi&s;ionary and &s;ecret piece of flattery,
that as glorious, and as <PB N="616" REF="191"> long, or even a longer line of
future coronets may &s;pring from our&s;elves, as have depended from our
ance&s;tors. We read in <HI>Virgil,</HI> that <HI>Anchi&s;es,</HI> to in&s;pire
his &s;on with the propere&s;t incitement to virtue, &s;hews him a long race of
kings, emperors, and heroes, whom <HI>Aeneas</HI> is fore-doomed to give ri&s;e
to: and the mi&s;ery of <HI>Macbeth</HI> is made by <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> to
proceed, le&s;s from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, than from the
di&s;appointed pride, that none of his own race &s;hall &s;ucceed him in the
throne.</P>
<P>THE pride of ance&s;try, and the de&s;ire of continuing our
lineage, when they tend to an incitement of virtuous and noble actions, are
undoubtedly laudable; and I &s;hould per|haps have indulged my&s;elf in the
plea&s;ing reflection, had not a particular &s;tory in a <HI>French</HI> Novel,
which I lately met with, put a &s;top to all vain glories, that can
po&s;&s;ibly be deduced from a long race of progenitors.</P>

<P>I MUST agree with my corre&s;pondent, that the &s;tudy of
Heraldry is at pre&s;ent in very little repute among us; and our nobility are
more anxious about pre&s;erving the genealogy of their hor&s;es, than of their
own family. Whatever value their progenitors may have formerly &s;et upon their
Blood, it is now found to be of no value, when put into the &s;cale and weighed
again&s;t &s;olid <HI>plebeian</HI> gold: Nor would the mo&s;t illu&s;trious
de&s;cendant from <HI>Cadwallader,</HI> or the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Kings,
&s;cruple to deba&s;e his lineage by an alliance with the daughter of a
city-plumb, though all her ance&s;tors were yeomen, and none of her family ever
<HI>bore arms.</HI> Titles of quality, when the owners have no other merit to
recommend them, are of no more e&s;timation, than tho&s;e which the courte&s;y
of the vulgar have be&s;towed on the deformed: and when I look over a long Tree
of De&s;cent, I &s;ometimes fancy I can di&s;cover the real characters of
<HI>Sharpers, Repro|bates,</HI> and <HI>Plunderers of their Country,</HI>
concealed under the titles of <HI>Dukes, Earls,</HI> and
<HI>Vi&s;counts.</HI></P>
<P>IT is well known, that the very &s;ervants, in the ab&s;ence of
their ma&s;ter, a&s;&s;ume the &s;ame titles; and <HI>Tom</HI> or
<HI>Harry,</HI> the butler or groom of his Grace, is always <HI>my Lord
Duke</HI> <PB N="618" REF="193"> in the kitchen or &s;tables. For this rea&s;on
I have thought proper to pre&s;ent my reader with the Pedigree of a Footman,
drawn up in the &s;ame &s;ounding titles, as are &s;o pompou&s;ly di&s;played
on the&s;e occasions: and I dare &s;ay it will appear no le&s;s illu&s;trious,
than the pedigrees of many families, which are neither celebrated for their
actions, nor di&s;tingui&s;hed by their virtues.</P>
<P>THE Family of the SKIPS, or SKIP-KENNELS, is very antient and
noble. The founder of it <HI>Maitre Jaques</HI> came into <HI>England</HI> with
the Dutche&s;s of Mazarine. He was &s;on of a Prince of the Blood, his mother
one of the <HI>Me&s;dames</HI> of <HI>France:</HI> This family is therefore
related to the mo&s;t illu&s;|trious <HI>Maitres d' Hot&egrave;l</HI> and
<HI>Valets de Chambre</HI> of that kindgom. <HI>Jaques</HI> had i&s;&s;ue two
Sons, <HI>viz. Robert</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI>; of whom <HI>Paul</HI> the
younge&s;t was inve&s;ted with the purple before he was eighteen, and made a
Bi&s;hop, and &s;oon after became an Archbi&s;hop. <HI>Robert,</HI> the elder,
came to be a Duke, but died without i&s;&s;ue: <HI>Paul,</HI> the Archbi&s;hop,
left behind him an only daughter, <HI>Barbara,</HI> ba&s;e-born, who was
afterwards Maid of Honour; and inter-marrying with a Lord of the Bed-chamber,
had a very numerous i&s;&s;ue by him; <HI>viz. Re|becca,</HI> born a week after
their marriage, and died young; <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> fir&s;t a Squire, afterwards
Knighted, High Sheriff of a County, and Colonel of the Militia; <HI>Peter,</HI>
rai&s;ed from a Cabin-Boy to a Lord of the Admiralty; <HI>William,</HI> a
Faggot in the Fir&s;t Regiment of the Guards, and a Brigadier;
<HI>Tho|mas,</HI> at fir&s;t an Earl's Elde&s;t Son, and afterwards Lord Mayor
of the City of <HI>London.</HI> The &s;everal branches of this family were no
le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed for their illu&s;trious progeny. <HI>Jaques</HI> the
founder, fir&s;t quartered lace on his coat, and <HI>Robert</HI> added the
&s;houlder-knot. Some of them, indeed, met with great trouble: Archbi&s;hop
<HI>Paul</HI> lo&s;t his See for getting a cook-maid with child;
<HI>Barbara,</HI> the Maid of Honour, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a big belly;
Brigadier <HI>William</HI> was killed by a Chairman in a pitched battle at an

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is my fortune to be married to a lady, who is an
extraordinary good hou&s;ewife, and is cried up by all the good women of her
acquaintance, for being the <HI>neate&s;t body in her hou&s;e</HI> they ever
knew. This, Sir, is my grievance: This &s;uperabundant Neatne&s;s is &s;o very
trouble&s;ome and di&s;gu&s;ting to me, that I prote&s;t I had rather lodge in
a carrier's inn, or take up my abode with the hor&s;es in the &s;tables.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that a due regard to Neatne&s;s
and Cleanline&s;s is as nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved in our habitations 
<PB N="620" REF="195"> as our per&s;ons: But though I &s;hould not chu&s;e to
have my hands begrimed like a chimney-&s;weeper's, I would not, as among the
&s;uper&s;titious <HI>Mahometans,</HI> wa&s;h them &s;ix times a day: And
though I &s;hould be loth to roll in a pig-&s;tye, yet I do not like to have my
hou&s;e rendered u&s;ele&s;s to me under the pretence of keeping it clean.</P>
<P>FOR my own part, I cannot &s;ee the difference between having
an hou&s;e that is always dirty, and an hou&s;e that is always to be cleaned. I
could very willingly compound to be wa&s;hed out of my home, with other
ma&s;ters of families, every Saturday night: But my wife is &s;o very notable,
that the &s;ame clean&s;ing work mu&s;t be repeated every day in the week. All
the morning long I am &s;ure to be entertained with the domestic concert of
&s;crubbing the floors, &s;couring the irons, and beating the carpets; and I am
con&s;tantly hunted from room to room, while one is to be du&s;ted, ano|ther
dry-rubbed, another wa&s;hed, and another run over with a dry mop. Thus,
indeed, I may be &s;aid to live in continual dirtine&s;s, that my hou&s;e may
be clean: For during the&s;e nice operations every apartment is &s;towed with
&s;oap, brickdu&s;t, &s;and, &s;crubbing-bru&s;hes, hair-brooms, rag-mops, and
di&s;hclouts.</P>
<P>YOU may &s;uppo&s;e, that the greate&s;t care is taken to
pre|vent the lea&s;t &s;peck of dirt from &s;oiling the floors: For this
rea&s;on all that come to our hou&s;e, (be&s;ides the ceremony of &s;craping at
the door,) are obliged to rub their &s;hoes for half an hour on a large ragged
mat at the entrance; and then they mu&s;t &s;traddle their way along &s;everal
le&s;&s;er mats, ranged at due di&s;tances from each other in the pa&s;&s;age,
and (like boys at play) come into the room with a hop, a &s;tep, and a 
<PB N="621" REF="196"> jump. The like caution is u&s;ed by all the family: I
my|&s;elf am &s;carce allowed to &s;tir a &s;tep without &s;lippers: my wife
creeps on tip-toe up and down &s;tairs: the maid-&s;ervants are continually
&s;tumping below in clogs or pattens; and the footman is obliged to &s;neak
about the hou&s;e bare-footed, as if he came with a &s;ly de&s;ign to &s;teal
&s;omething.</P>
<P>AFTER what has been &s;aid you will naturally conclude, that
my wife mu&s;t be no le&s;s nice in other particulars. In|deed, &s;he cannot
conceive that any thing, which is done by &s;o neat a woman, can po&s;&s;ibly
give offence: I have there|fore been in pain for her &s;everal times, when I
have &s;een her, before company, du&s;t the tea-cups with a foul apron or a
wa&s;hing-gown; and I have more than once blu&s;hed for her, when through her
extreme cleanline&s;s &s;he has not been con|tented without breathing into our
drinking-gla&s;&s;es, and after|wards wiping them with her pocket handkerchief.
People, Mr. TOWN, who are very intimate with families, &s;eldom &s;ee them
(e&s;pecially the female part) but in di&s;gui&s;e: and it will be readily
allowed, that a lady wears a very different a&s;pect, when &s;he comes before
company, than when &s;he fir&s;t &s;ets down to her toilette. My wife appears
decent enough in her apparel, to tho&s;e who vi&s;it us in the after|noon: but
in the morning &s;he is quite another figure. Her u&s;ual di&s;habille then is,
an ordinary &s;tuff jacket and petticoat, a double clout thrown over her head
and pinned under her chin, a black grea&s;y bonnet, and a coar&s;e dowlas
apron; &s;o that you would rather take her for a chair-woman. Nor, indeed does
&s;he &s;cruple to &s;toop to the meane&s;t drudgery of one: for &s;uch is her
love of Cleanline&s;s, that I have often &s;een her on her knees whitening an
hearth, or &s;preading dabs of vinegar and fullers earth over the boards.</P>
<P><PB N="622" REF="197">IT is ob&s;erved by <HI>Swift,</HI> that

<Q REND="inline">"a nice man is a man of na&s;ty ideas:"</Q> In
like manner we may affirm, that your very neat people are the mo&s;t &s;lovenly
on many occa&s;ions. I have told you my wife's morning trim: but be&s;ides
this, &s;he has another cu&s;tom, which creates the greate&s;t di&s;gu&s;t in
me. You mu&s;t know, Sir, that among other charms &s;he prides her&s;elf
va&s;tly in a fine &s;et of teeth: and &s;omebody has told her, that nothing is
&s;o good for them as to rub them every morning with <HI>Scotch</HI> &s;nuff
and fa&s;ting &s;pittle. As an hu&s;|band is no &s;tranger, this recipe is
con&s;tantly admini&s;tered in my pre&s;ence before breakfa&s;t; and after this
delicate appli|cation, her pretty mouth, (which is afterwards wiped for
<HI>me</HI> to ki&s;s,) in order to pre&s;erve her gums from the &s;curvy,
mu&s;t be rinced&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;with her own water.</P>
<P>I SHALL dwell no longer on this &s;ubject, as I fear it may
prove &s;urfeiting both to you and your readers: I &s;hall there|fore conclude
with telling you, that this &s;crupulous delicacy of my wife in the Neatne&s;s
of her hou&s;e was the means of our lo&s;ing a very good fortune. A rich old
uncle, on whom we had great dependance, came up to town la&s;t &s;ummer on
purpo&s;e to pay us a vi&s;it: but though he had rode above &s;ixty miles that
day, he was obliged to &s;tand in the pa&s;&s;age till his boots were pulled
off, for fear of &s;oiling the <HI>Turkey</HI> carpet. After &s;upper the old
gentleman, as was his con&s;tant practice, de&s;ired to have his pipe: but this
you may be &s;ure could by no means be allowed, as the filthy &s;tench of the
to|bacco would never be got out of the furniture again; and it was with much
ado, that my wife would even &s;uffer him to go down and &s;moke in the
kitchen. We had no room <PB N="623" REF="198"> lodge him in except a garret
with nothing but bare walls; becau&s;e the Chints bed-chamber was, indeed, too
nice for a dirty country &s;quire. The&s;e &s;lights very much chagrined my
good uncle: but he had not been with us above a day or two, before my wife and
he came to an open quarrel; and the occa&s;ion of it was this. It happened,
that he had brought a favourite pointer with him, who at his fir&s;t co|ming
was immediately locked up in the coal-hole: but the dog having found means to
e&s;cape, had crept &s;lily up &s;tairs, and (be&s;ides other marks of his want
of delicacy) had very calmly &s;tretched him&s;elf out upon a crim&s;on
dama&s;k &s;ettee. My wife not only &s;entenced him to the di&s;cipline of the
whip, but in&s;i&s;ted upon having the criminal hanged up after|wards; when the
ma&s;ter interpo&s;ing in his behalf, it pro|duced &s;uch high words between
them, that my uncle or|dered his hor&s;e, and &s;wore he would never <HI>darken
our doors</HI> again as long as he breathed. He went home, and about two months
after died: but as he could not forgive the ill treatment, which both he and
his dog had met with at our hou&s;e, he had altered his will, which before he
had made entirely in our favour.</P>

<P>IT may not be improper, as my corre&s;pondent has but &s;lightly
touched upon this topic, to add a word or two, by way of po&s;tcript to his
letter, on the extraordinary &s;ollici|tude of many notable hou&s;ewives in the
care and pre&s;erva|tion of their furniture. In middling genteel families it is
not uncommon to have things more for &s;hew than u&s;e: <PB N="624" REF="199">
and I cannot but applaud the ingenious thought of a friend of mine, who has
contrived to furni&s;h his hou&s;e in the mo&s;t elegant ta&s;te at a very
&s;mall expence. He is plea&s;ed, it is true, to eat off your common &s;tone
ware, becau&s;e it looks &s;o clean; but you &s;ee his beaufet crowded with a
variety of curious enamelled China plates, which are ranged in &s;uch manner as
to conceal the &s;treaks of white paint that cement the broken pieces together:
he likes to drink his porter out of the original ale-hou&s;e pewter pot; but a
large &s;ilver tan|kard always &s;tands upon the &s;ide-board, which the mo&s;t
curious eye cannot at that di&s;tance di&s;cover to be <HI>French</HI> plate.
The whole range of rooms in his middle &s;tory is mo&s;t grandly fitted up: but
as it would be pity to &s;oil &s;uch good furniture, his curtains, which we
mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e to be made of the riche&s;t dama&s;k, are carefully pinned
up in paper-bags; and the chairs, of which the &s;eats and backs are
undoubtedly of the &s;ame &s;tuff, are no le&s;s cautiou&s;ly &s;kreened with
ordinary-checked linnen. Thus does he an|&s;wer, by the appearance of finery,
all the purpo&s;es of pride and o&s;tentation:&mdash;Like many families, who
being really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ornamental and u&s;eful furniture, make no
more u&s;e of it than the beau blockhead does of his library; which, though it
contains many books finely bound and gilt, is de&s;igned merely for &s;hew, and
it would &s;poil the backs or rumple the leaves to look into the contents of
them.</P>

<P>_THE u&s;e of language is the ready communi|cation of our
thoughts to one another. As we cannot produce the objects which rai&s;e ideas
in our minds, we u&s;e words which are made &s;igns of tho&s;e objects
them&s;elves. No man could convey to another the idea of a table or chair,
without pointing to tho&s;e pieces of furniture: as children are taught to
remember the names of things by looking at their pictures. Thus if I wanted to
mention King <HI>Charles</HI> on hor&s;e-back, I mu&s;t carry my companion to
<HI>Charing-Cro&s;s</HI>; and would I next tell him of the &s;tatue of Sir
<HI>John Barnard,</HI> we mu&s;t trudge back again, and he mu&s;t wait for my
mean|ing 'till we got to the <HI>Royal Exchange.</HI> We &s;hould be like the
&s;ages of <HI>Laputa,</HI> who (as <HI>Gulliver</HI> tells us) having
&s;ub&s;tituted <HI>things</HI> for <HI>words,</HI> u&s;ed to carry about them 
<PB N="626" REF="201"> &s;uch <HI>things</HI> as were nece&s;&s;ary to
expre&s;s the particular bu&s;ine&s;s they were to di&s;cour&s;e on. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have often beheld (&s;ays he) two of tho&s;e
&s;ages almo&s;t &s;inking under the weight of their packs, like pedlars among
us: who, when they met in the &s;treets, would lay down their loads, open their
&s;acks, and hold conver&s;ation for an hour together; then put up their
implements, help each other to re&s;ume their burthens, and take their
leave."</Q> In the&s;e circum&s;tances a man of the fewe&s;t words could not,
indeed, talk without carrying about him a much larger apparatus of
conver&s;ation, than is contained in the bag of the noted <HI>Yeates,</HI> or
any other &s;light-of-hand arti&s;t: he could not &s;peak of a chicken or an
owl, but it mu&s;t be ready in his pocket to be produ|ced. In &s;uch a ca&s;e
we could not &s;ay we heard, but we &s;aw the conver&s;ation of a friend; as in
the epi&s;tolary corre&s;pond|ence carried on by tho&s;e pretty
<HI>hieroglyphic</HI> letters (as they are called), where the picture of a
<HI>deer</HI> and a <HI>woman finely dre&s;t</HI> is made to &s;tand for the
expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>dear lady.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the invention of words has removed the&s;e difficulties; and
we may talk not only of any thing we have &s;een, but what neither we, nor the
per&s;ons to whom we &s;peak, ever &s;aw. Thus we can convey to another the
idea of a battle, without being reduced to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of
learn|ing it 
<Q REND="inline">"from the cannon's mouth:"</Q> and we can talk
of the people in the world of the moon, without being obliged to make u&s;e of
Bi&s;hop <HI>Wilkins</HI>'s artificial wings to fly thither. Words, therefore,
in the ordinary cour&s;e of life, are like the paper-money among merchants;
invented as a more ready conveyance, by which the large&s;t &s;um can be
tran&s;|mitted to the mo&s;t di&s;tant places with as much ea&s;e as a let|ter;
while the &s;ame in &s;pecie would require bags and che&s;ts, and even carts or
&s;hips to tran&s;port it. But, however great the&s;e advantages are, the u&s;e
of language has brought along with it &s;everal inconveniences, as well as
paper-money: for as this latter is more liable to mi&s;carry, more ea&s;ily
concealed, <PB N="627" REF="202"> carried off, or counterfeited than bullion,
merchants have frequent cau&s;e to complain, that the convenience of this
&s;ort of ca&s;h is not without &s;ome alloy of evil; and we find, that in the
u&s;e of language there is &s;o much room for deceit and mi&s;take, that though
it does not render it u&s;ele&s;s, it is much to be wi&s;hed &s;ome remedy
could be contrived.</P>
<P>MEN are &s;o apt to u&s;e the &s;ame words in different
&s;en&s;es, and to call the &s;ame thing by different names, that they can|not
oftentimes under&s;tand or be under&s;tood. If one calls that thing black which
another calls green, or that prodigality which another calls genero&s;ity, they
mi&s;take each other's meaning; and can never come to agree, 'till they explain
the words. It is to this we owe &s;o much wrangling in di&s;|cour&s;e, and &s;o
many volumes of controver&s;y on almo&s;t every part of literature. I have
known a di&s;pute carried on with great warmth, and when the di&s;putants have
come to explain what each meant, it has been di&s;covered they were both of a
&s;ide: like the men in the Play, who met and fought fir&s;t, and after each
had been heartily beat found them&s;elves to be friends. What &s;hould we
&s;ay, if this practice of calling things by their wrong names was to obtain
among trade&s;men? If you was to &s;end to your haberda&s;her for an hat, you
might receive a pair of &s;tockings; or in&s;tead of a cordial julep from your
apothecary, be furni&s;hed with a cathartic or a cly&s;ter.</P>
<P>IT would be needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t on the inconveniences
ari|&s;ing from the mi&s;u&s;e or mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of terms in all ver|bal
combats; whether they be fought on the &s;pot by word of mouth, or (like a game
of Che&s;s) maintained, even tho' lands and &s;eas interpo&s;e, by the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the pre&s;s. In our ordinary conver&s;ation it is
notorious, that no le&s;s confu|&s;ion has ari&s;en from the wrong application
or perver&s;ion of the original and mo&s;t natural import of words. Thus, for
in&s;tance, the word <HI>Devil,</HI> is u&s;ed at pre&s;ent only as a bug|bear
for children; nor will it rai&s;e in the mo&s;t vulgar minds 
<PB N="628" REF="203"> the idea even of a cloven foot or the &s;mell of
brim&s;tone: and all we can under&s;tand by it are, the errand-boy of a
printing-hou&s;e, the name of a tavern, and the broiled giz|zard of a turkey.
The no le&s;s tremendous words, <HI>damned</HI> and <HI>helli&s;h,</HI> are
u&s;urped equally to &s;ignify any thing &s;uperla|tively good, as well as bad:
and I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed to mention, that we cannot wonder a particular
liquor &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>bi&s;hop,</HI> when the
title of the highe&s;t dignitary of our church has been pro&s;tituted to a more
&s;candalous purpo&s;e. A mere country put might be &s;tartled (at this
juncture e&s;pecially) at the warlike &s;ound of a <HI>route,</HI> a
<HI>drum,</HI> or a <HI>drum-major</HI>; which, we know, have been long adopted
by the fa&s;hionable world without any de|&s;ign to alarm us with the notion of
a campaign or a battle, but only to call us (without a pun) to more peaceful
engage|ments: and he would be very much &s;urpri&s;ed to receive a card from a
lady of quality inviting him to an <HI>Hurricane,</HI> or perhaps an
EARTHQUAKE.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER, when I commenced author, I publi&s;hed a little
pamphlet, which I flattered my&s;elf had &s;ome merit, though I mu&s;t
confe&s;s it did not &s;ell. Con&s;cious of my grow|ing fame, I re&s;olved to
&s;end the fir&s;t fruits of it to an aunt in the country, that my relations
might judge of the great ho|nour I was likely to prove to the family: but how
was I mortified, when the good lady &s;ent me word, 
<Q REND="inline">"that &s;he was &s;orry to find I had
<HI>ruined</HI> my&s;elf, and had wrote a book; for the par&s;on of the
pari&s;h had a&s;&s;ured her, that authors were never worth a farthing, and
always died in a goal."</Q> Notwith&s;tanding this remon&s;trance I have
&s;till per&s;i&s;ted in my <HI>ruin</HI>; which at pre&s;ent I cannot &s;ay is
quite compleated, as I can make three meals a day, have yet a coat to my back,
with a clean &s;hirt for Sundays at lea&s;t, and am lodged &s;omewhat below a
garret. However, this pre|diction of my aunt has often led me to con&s;ider, in
how many &s;en&s;es different from its general acceptation the word 
<PB N="629" REF="204"> RUINED is frequently made u&s;e of. When we hear this
ap|plied to another, we &s;hould naturally imagine the per&s;on is reduced to a
&s;tate wor&s;e than he was in before, and &s;o low that it is &s;carce
po&s;&s;ible for him to ri&s;e again: but we &s;hall often find, in&s;tead of
his being undone, that he has rather met with &s;ome extraordinary good
fortune; and that tho&s;e who pronounce him <HI>ruined,</HI> either mean you
&s;hould under&s;tand it in &s;ome other light, or el&s;e call him undone,
becau&s;e he differs from them in his way of life, or becau&s;e they wi&s;h him
to be in that &s;ituation. I need not point out the extreme cruelty, as well as
inju&s;tice, in the mi&s;applica|tion of this term; as it may litterally
<HI>ruin</HI> a man, by de|&s;troying his character: according to the old
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> proverb, <HI>give a dog an ill name, and hang him.</HI></P>
<P>MOST people are, indeed, &s;o entirely taken up with their own
narrow views, that, like the jaundiced eye, every thing appears to them of the
&s;ame colour; and it is no wonder, that they &s;hould &s;ee ruin &s;taring
every man in the face, who happens not to think as they do. From this
&s;elfi&s;h preju|dice we are led to make a wrong judgment of the motives and
actions of others: I &s;hall, therefore, here &s;et down a catalogue of &s;ome
of my own acquaintance, whom the cha|rity and good-nature of the world have not
&s;crupled to pro|nounce ab&s;olutely <HI>ruined.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<P>A young clergyman of <HI>Cambridge</HI> might have had a good
college living in about thirty years time, or have been head of the hou&s;e:
but he cho&s;e to quit his fellow&s;hip for a &s;mall cure in town with a view
of recommending him&s;elf by his preaching&mdash;<HI>Ruined.</HI></P> 
<P>A fellow of another college refu&s;ed to quit his books and his
retirement, to live as chaplain with a &s;moking, drinking, &s;wearing,
fox-hunting country &s;quire, who would have pro|vided for
him&mdash;<HI>Ruined.</HI></P> 
<P>Dr. <HI>Cla&s;&s;ic,</HI> a young phy&s;ician from
<HI>Oxford,</HI> might have had more practice than <HI>Radcliffe</HI> or
<HI>Mead:</HI> but having &s;tudied <PB N="630" REF="205"> <HI>Ari&s;totle's
Poetics,</HI> and read the <HI>Greek</HI> Tragedies as well as <HI>Galen</HI>
and <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> he was tempted to write a play, which was
univer&s;ally applauded&mdash;<HI>Ruined.</HI></P> 
<P>A Student of the <HI>Temple</HI> might have made &s;ure of a
Judge's Robes or the Chancellor's Seals: but being tired of &s;aunter|ing in
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall</HI> without even getting half a guinea for a motion,
he has accepted of a commi&s;&s;ion in one of the new-rai&s;ed regiments, and
is&mdash;<HI>Ruined.</HI></P> 
<P>A younger brother of a good family threw him&s;elf away upon an
ob&s;cure widow with a jointure of 500<HI>l. per annum</HI> by which he
is&mdash;<HI>Ruined.</HI>&mdash;Another, a man of fortune, fell in love with,
and married a genteel girl without a farthing; and though &s;he makes him an
excellent wife, he is univer&s;ally allowed to have&mdash;<HI>Ruined
him&s;elf.</HI></P></Q>
<P>BEFORE I conclude I cannot but take notice of the &s;trange
&s;en&s;e, in which a friend of mine once heard this word u&s;ed by a girl of
the town. The young creature, being all life and &s;pirits, engro&s;&s;ed all
the conver&s;ation to her&s;elf; and her|&s;elf indeed was the &s;ubject of all
the conver&s;ation: But what mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed him, was the manner, in which
&s;he u&s;ed this word <HI>Ruined</HI>; which occurred frequently in her
di&s;cour&s;e, though never intended by her to convey the meaning gene|rally
affixed to it. It &s;erved her &s;ometimes as an aera to determine the date of
every occurrence&mdash;&s;he bought &s;uch a gown ju&s;t after &s;he was
<HI>ruined</HI>&mdash;the fir&s;t time &s;he &s;aw <HI>Garrick</HI> in
<HI>Ranger,</HI> &s;he was in doubt whether it was before or after &s;he was
<HI>ruined.</HI>&mdash;Having occa&s;ion to mention a young gen|tleman, &s;he
bur&s;t into raptures&mdash;O he is a dear creature!&mdash;He it was that
<HI>ruined</HI> me.&mdash;O he is a dear &s;oul!&mdash;He car|ried me to an inn
ten miles from my father's hou&s;e in the country, where he <HI>ruined</HI>
me.&mdash;If he had not <HI>ruined</HI> me, I &s;hould have been as mi&s;erable
and as moping as my &s;i&s;ters. But the dear &s;oul was forced to go to &s;ea,
and I was obliged to come upon the town, three weeks after I was
<HI>ruined</HI>&mdash;no, not &s;o much as three weeks after I was
<HI>ruined</HI>&mdash;yes, it was full three weeks after I was
<HI>ruined.</HI></P>

<DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 14th, 1756.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM ju&s;t arrived here, after having paid a vi&s;it to our
old acquaintance <HI>Jack Quick&s;et,</HI> who is now become the Reverend Mr.
<HI>Quick&s;et,</HI> Rector of &mdash; pari&s;h in the North-Riding of this
county, a living worth upwards of three hundred pounds <HI>per annum.</HI> As
the ceremonies of ordination have occa&s;ioned no alteration in <HI>Jack</HI>'s
morals or behaviour, the Figure he makes in the church is &s;ome|what
remarkable; but as there are many other incumbents of country livings, who&s;e
clerical characters will be found to tally with his, perhaps a &s;light
&s;ketch, or, as I may &s;ay, <HI>rough draught</HI> of him, with &s;ome
account of my vi&s;it, will not be unentertaining to your readers.</P>
<P>JACK, hearing that I was in this part of the world, &s;ent me
a very hearty letter, informing me that he had been <HI>double-japanned</HI>
(as he called it) about a year ago, and was the pre&s;ent incummbent of
&mdash;; where if I would favour him with my company, he would give me a cup of
the be&s;t <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Stingo, and would engage to &s;hew me a noble
day's &s;port, as he was in a fine open country with plenty of foxes. I
rejoiced to hear he was &s;o comfortably &s;ettled, and &s;et out immediately
for his living. When I arrived within the gate, my ears were alarmed with
&s;uch a loud chorus of <HI>No mortals on earth are &s;o happy as we,</HI> that
I began to think I had made a mi&s;take; till ob&s;erving its clo&s;e
neighbourhood to the church convinced me, that this could be no other than the
Par&s;onage-Hou&s;e. On my entrance my friend (whom <PB N="633" REF="208"> I
found in the mid&s;t of a room-full of fox-hunters in boots and bob wigs) got
up to welcome me to &mdash;, and em|bracing me, gave me the full flavour of his
Stingo by belching in my face, as he did me the honour of &s;aluting me. He
then introduced me to his friends, and placing me at the right hand of his own
elbow chair, a&s;&s;ured them that I was a very <HI>hone&s;t Cock,</HI> and
loved a chace of five and twenty miles an end as well as any of them: to
pre&s;erve the credit of which character, I immediately complied, with an
injunction (though I mu&s;t confe&s;s with le&s;s real rapture than a &s;taunch
foxhunter) to to&s;s off a pint bumper of Port, with the foot of the fox dipped
and &s;queezed into it to give a ze&s;t to the liquor.</P>
<P>BUT the whole oeconomy of <HI>Jack</HI>'s life is very
different from that of his brethren. In&s;tead of having a wife and a
hou&s;e-full of children, (the mo&s;t common family of a country clergyman,) he
is &s;ingle, unle&s;s we credit &s;ome idle whi&s;pers in the pari&s;h that he
is married to his hou&s;ekeeper. The calm amu&s;ement of piquet, che&s;s, and
back-gammon have no charms for <HI>Jack,</HI> who &s;ees 
<Q REND="inline">"his deare&s;t action in the field,"</Q> and
boa&s;ts that he has a brace of as good hunters in his &s;table, as ever leg
was laid over. Hunting and &s;hoot|ing are the only bu&s;ine&s;s of his life,
foxhounds and pointers lay about in every parlour, and he is him&s;elf like
<HI>Pi&s;tol,</HI> al|ways in boots. The e&s;timation in which he holds his
friends is rated according to their excellence as &s;port&s;men; and to be able
to make a good &s;hot or hunt a pack of hounds well, are admirable qualities.
His pari&s;hioners often earn a &s;hil|ling and a cup of ale at his hou&s;e, by
coming to acquaint him, that they have found a hare &s;itting, or a fox in
cover. One day, while I was alone with my friend, the &s;ervant 
<PB N="634" REF="209"> came in to tell him that the Clerk wanted to &s;peak
with him. He was ordered in; but I could not help &s;miling when (in&s;tead of
giving notice of a burying, chri&s;tening, or &s;ome other church bu&s;ine&s;s,
as I expected) I found the ho|ne&s;t clerk only come to acquaint his reverend
&s;uperior, that there was a covey of partridges, of a dozen brace at lea&s;t,
not above three fields from the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>JACK's elder brother Sir <HI>Thomas Quick&s;et,</HI> who
pre&s;ented him with the benefice he now enjoys, is lord of the manor: &s;o
that <HI>Jack</HI> has full power to beat up the game unmole&s;ted. He goes out
three times a week with his brother's hounds, whether Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> hunts
or not; and has be&s;ides a deputation from him as lord of the manor,
con&s;igning the game to his care, and empowering him to take away all guns,
nets, and dogs from per&s;ons not duly qualified. <HI>Jack</HI> is more proud
of this office than many other country clergymen are of being in the
commi&s;&s;ion for the peace. Poaching is in his eye the mo&s;t heinous crime
in the two tables; nor does the cure of &s;ouls appear to him half &s;o
important a duty as the pre&s;ervation of the Game.</P>
<P>SUNDAY, you may &s;uppo&s;e, is as dull and tedious to this
ordained &s;port&s;man, as to any fine lady in town: not that he makes the
duties of his function any fatigue to him but as this day is nece&s;&s;arily a
day of re&s;t from the u&s;ual toils of the cha&s;e. It happened, that the
fir&s;t Sunday after I was with him he had engaged to take care of a Church, in
the ab&s;ence of a neighbouring clergyman, which was about twenty miles off. I
engaged to accompany him: and the more to encourage me, he had a&s;&s;ured me,
that we &s;hould ride over as fine a champaign open country as any in the 
<PB N="635" REF="210"> <HI>North.</HI> Accordingly I was rouzed by him in the
morning before day-break by a loud hollowing of <HI>hark to Merriman,</HI> and
the repeated &s;macks of his half-hunter; and after we had fortified our
&s;tomachs with &s;everal &s;lices of hung beef and a horn or two of &s;tingo,
we &s;allied forth. <HI>Jack</HI> was mounted upon a hunter, which he
a&s;&s;ured me was never yet <HI>thrown out</HI>: and as we rode along, he
could not help lament|ing that &s;o fine a <HI>&s;oft</HI> morning &s;hould be
thrown away upon a Sunday; at the &s;ame time remarking, that the dogs might
run brea&s;t high.</P>
<P>THOUGH we made the be&s;t of our way over hedge and ditch, and
<HI>took</HI> every thing, we were often delayed by trying if we could prick a
hare; or by leaving the road to examine a piece of cover; and he frequently
made me &s;top, not to look at the pro&s;pect, but while he pointed out the
particular cour&s;e that <HI>Reynard</HI> took, or the &s;pot where he had
<HI>earth'd.</HI> At length we arrived on full gallop at the Church, where we
found the congregation waiting for us: but as <HI>Jack</HI> had no|thing to do
but to alight, pull his band out of the &s;ermon|ca&s;e, give his brown
&s;cratch bob a &s;hake, and clap on the &s;urplice, he was pre&s;ently
equipped for the &s;ervice. In &s;hort he behaved him&s;elf both in the de&s;k
and pulpit to the entire &s;atisfaction of all the pari&s;h as well as the
&s;quire of it, who after thanking <HI>Jack</HI> for his excellent
di&s;cour&s;e, very cor|dially took us home to dinner with him.</P>
<P>I SHALL not trouble you with an account of our enter|tainment
at the &s;quire's, who being him&s;elf as keen a &s;port&s;|man as ever
followed a pack of dogs, was hugely delighted with <HI>Jack</HI>'s
conver&s;ation. <HI>Church and King,</HI> and another particular toa&s;t, were
(in compliment I &s;uppo&s;e to my friend's <PB N="636" REF="211"> clerical
character) the fir&s;t drank after dinner; but the&s;e were directly followed
by a pint bumper to <HI>Hor&s;es &s;ound, Dogs hearty. Earth &s;topt, and Foxes
plenty.</HI> When we had run over again, with great joy and vociferation, as
many chaces as the time would permit, the bell called us to even|ing prayers:
after which, (though the &s;quire would fain have had us &s;tay and take an
hunt with him) we mounted our hor&s;es at the church-door, and rode home in the
dark; becau&s;e <HI>Jack</HI> had engaged to meet &s;everal of his
brother-&s;port&s;men, who were to lie all night at his own hou&s;e, to be in
readine&s;s to make up for the lo&s;s of Sunday, by going out a cock-&s;hooting
very early the next morning.</P>
<P>I MUST leave it to you, Cou&s;in, to make what reflec|tions
you plea&s;e on this character; only ob&s;erving, that the country can
furni&s;h many in&s;tances of the&s;e ordained &s;port&s;|men, who&s;e thoughts
are more taken up with the &s;table or the dog-kennel than the church: and
indeed, it will be found that our friend <HI>Jack</HI> and all of his &s;tamp
are regarded by their pari&s;hioners, not as Par&s;ons of the Pari&s;h, but
rather as Squires in Orders.</P>

<P>_IT is with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure that I have ob&s;erved an
article in the news-papers, &s;ig|nifying that the magi&s;trates of this city
will oblige all taverns, ale-hou&s;es, &amp;c. to be &s;hut up to-morrow, which
is appointed to be &s;et apart as a day of &s;olemn fa&s;t and humiliation, on
account of tho&s;e dreadful Earthquakes from which we have been &s;o
providentially pre&s;erved. Without &s;uch a re&s;triction it is to be feared,
that too many of the vulgar will ob&s;erve this day in the &s;ame manner as
they are wont to ob&s;erve the or|dinary <PB N="638" REF="213"> Sundays; which
they have been long accu&s;tomed to look upon as dedicated to Idlene&s;s and
Intemperance; to which deities they very devoutly pour their libations
(accord|ing to their own phra&s;e) in a <HI>church with a chimney in
it.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if the common herd are to be thus compelled to their duty,
per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, who are above the law, will I doubt pay as little
regard to this nominal fa&s;t-day, as to <HI>A&s;h-Wedne&s;day,
Good-Friday,</HI> or the long-exploded 30th of <HI>January.</HI> Nor can we
expect, that it will work any greater reformation of manners in them, than the
ab&s;urd panic oc|ca&s;ioned formerly by the ridiculous predictions of a
<HI>Swi&s;s</HI> madman. Therefore, as they are not to be frightened into a
&s;en&s;e of virtue and religion, we &s;hould rather try to wean them gradually
from their darling vices; which may be kept under by &s;oftening methods,
though we cannot hope wholly to eradicate them. For this purpo&s;e, the fir&s;t
&s;tep to be previou&s;ly taken, as it appears to me, &s;hould be to decoy
people of quality into coming to church, by making it as fa&s;hionable to be
&s;een there, as it was &s;ome time ago to meet at <HI>Ranelagh</HI> on a
Sunday. They mu&s;t, therefore, be al|lowed to curte&s;y, bow, nod, &s;mile,
ogle, whi&s;per, or even bawl to one another, before the &s;ervice is begun;
and that churches may re&s;emble other public places of diver&s;ion, ladies and
gentlemen may be permitted to &s;end their &s;ervants to keep places in the
pews: but it &s;hall on no con&s;ideration be lawful for them (as is their
cu&s;tom at the opera or play-hou&s;e) to di&s;turb the congregation by
dropping in while the prayers are reading or to, interrupt the par&s;on by
talking loud in the middle of the &s;ermon.</P>
<P><PB N="639" REF="214">THIS point being once gained, it might be
po&s;&s;ible to bring about &s;ome other reformations in the polite
amu&s;e|ments. Perhaps to bani&s;h all &s;uch moral plays as the
<HI>Chances</HI> for ever from our theatres, would be in effect to &s;hut them
up, or condemn them to empty boxes: the polite world may, therefore, be
&s;ometimes indulged with them <HI>at the particular de&s;ire of &s;everal
per&s;ons of quality</HI>; or for the be|nefit of &s;ome ho&s;pital, when their
appearance may be attri|buted to a motive of charity. Nor would I be &s;o
&s;crupu|lous as to aboli&s;h Ma&s;querades entirely; though I would have them
put under new regulations: and no lady &s;hould be &s;uffered to go there
half-naked under the pretence of being better di&s;gui&s;ed; nor &s;hould any
one be allowed to per&s;onate <HI>Eve,</HI> though with a fig-leaf. As to the
darling amu&s;ement of Gaming, I fear it would be a vain attempt to think of
re&s;training it within any bounds at pre&s;ent: nor is it po&s;&s;ible to
expell the card-table from the routes of per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, even upon a
Sunday. I would therefore pro|po&s;e, that &s;ince they mu&s;t play, the
winnings on that day &s;hould be given to the poor of the pari&s;h; and that
they &s;hould u&s;e a particular &s;ort of cards (like tho&s;e contrived for
the amu&s;ement and in&s;truction of children) &s;trewed with texts of
&s;cripture and other religious and moral &s;entences.</P>
<P>GALLANTRY and intrigue may be likewi&s;e reckoned among the
fa&s;hionable amu&s;ements of the pre&s;ent age: and I confe&s;s I am at a
lo&s;s to know under what re&s;trictions to confine them. Married people may
perhaps be allowed to indulge them&s;elves in any freedoms, by the mutual
con&s;ent of each party; provided always, that they are per&s;ons of
di&s;tinction, and that the match between them was made merely on account of
family or fortune, in conformity to <PB N="640" REF="215"> the true &s;en&s;e
and &s;pirit of the late Marriage Act. With re&s;pect to tho&s;e, who take a
plea&s;ure in debauching raw country girls and common trade&s;mens daughters, I
had once a thought, that a clau&s;e &s;hould be added to the above|mentioned
Act, to oblige the offenders to do penance in a white &s;heet; but I have
&s;ince con&s;idered, that our modern bucks and bloods would probably take as
much pride in this badge of honour, as a young officer in his &s;carf and
cockade. As to the genteel practice of keeping mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, no one
&s;hould be allowed to take a girl into keeping, but tho&s;e who are already
pa&s;t their grand climacteric, and may be &s;uppo&s;ed to want a nur&s;e:
except it &s;hould be thought expedient to extend this privilege to tho&s;e
&s;pirited young fellows, who at the age of five and twenty have worn down
their con&s;titutions to three&s;core.</P>
<P>WE cannot but admire the extreme courage and &s;en&s;e of
honour, which characteri&s;es our modern heroes, and in&s;pires them
&s;ometimes with a de&s;ire of killing their friends, and &s;ometimes of
killing them&s;elves. But as this noble &s;pirit &s;hould be only exerted
again&s;t the common enemy, the honour of the Duelli&s;t might be &s;atisfied,
I &s;hould think, by a mock-combat without blood&s;hed; and the courage of the
Suicide might be confined to a bare <HI>attempt</HI> on his own life, without
the lo&s;s of it. Duels, therefore, &s;hould be fought with guarded &s;oils, as
in tragedy-rencounters; and any gentleman (or even mechanic) who finds an
inclination to make away with him&s;elf, may be allowed to try the expe|riment,
by drawing a knife or razor acro&s;s his throat &s;o as not to cut the
wind-pipe, or by running a &s;word through the &s;kin without piercing the
ribs; or he may fla&s;h a pi&s;tol in his face charged with powder only, or be
tucked up in his <PB N="641" REF="216"> own garters with a wad of cotton about
his neck, and his neare&s;t relation &s;tanding by, ready to cut him down (if
he plea&s;es) before he be quite dead.</P>
<P>I am prevented from per&s;uing this &s;ubject any farther, in
order to make room for the following letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Mr. TOWN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the day appointed, for a General Fa&s;t in the&s;e
king|doms is now at hand, I &s;hall beg leave to touch upon &s;ome laxities in
the u&s;ual manner of ob&s;erving a Fa&s;t; which though they are not of
&s;ufficient dignity to be taken notice of from the pulpit, &s;hould yet be
pointed out, as the vio|lation of the Fa&s;t in the&s;e particulars is almo&s;t
univer&s;al.</P>
<P>THE very name of a Fa&s;t implies a day of ab&s;tinence, of
mortification and &s;elf-denial; which has always been in|joined as a
nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;ubduing irregular de&s;ires, and fitting us for holy
meditations. For this rea&s;on, in former days, when people of quality ro&s;e
earlier than even mecha|nics now open their &s;hops, when the Court it&s;elf
dined at eleven, that meal was deferred till four o'clock in compliance with
this religious exerci&s;e, which was in tho&s;e times a real ab&s;tinence, a
true piece of mortification and &s;elf-denial. But if the ob&s;ervance of a
Fa&s;t con&s;i&s;ts in not dining till four o'clock, our per&s;ons of fa&s;hion
may be &s;aid to fa&s;t every day of their lives. In truth, the &s;everal hours
of the day are adapted to &s;uch very different employments to what they were
formerly, that our four o'clock &s;tands in the place of their eleven: and
nothing can be more ab&s;urd (to u&s;e no har&s;her term) than to adhere to the
form in the performance of a religious act, when by the alteration of
circum&s;tances, <PB N="642" REF="217"> that form flatly contradicts the very
meaning of its original in&s;titution. I would al&s;o a&s;k tho&s;e rigid
devotees, who ob|&s;erve this day in all the &s;trictne&s;s of the letter, and
would be &s;hocked at &s;ight of a leg of mutton or beef-&s;teak on their
tables, whether the dining upon &s;alt or other fi&s;h, may not be con&s;idered
rather as fea&s;ting than fa&s;ting, if (as is often the ca&s;e) it &s;hould
happen to be a di&s;h they are remarkably fond of. All the&s;e methods of
keeping a Fa&s;t without ab&s;ti|nence, mortification, or &s;elf-denial, are
mere quibbles to evade the performance of our duty, and entirely fru&s;trate
the de&s;ign of appointing this &s;olemnity. There is &s;ome|thing of this
nature very commonly practi&s;ed in <HI>France:</HI> where there are many
families who keep the whole Lent with great &s;trictne&s;s; but the la&s;t
night of it invite a great deal of company to &s;upper. The moment the clock
&s;trikes twelve, a magnificent entertainment, con&s;i&s;ting of all &s;orts of
rich fare, is &s;erved up, and the&s;e mo&s;t Chri&s;tian debauchees &s;it down
to indulge in luxury, without &s;inning again&s;t the Canon.</P>

<DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 30<HI>th</HI> 1756.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I HAVE ju&s;t now, with near an hundred more, taken the
fir&s;t degree, which this Univer&s;ity confers on her &s;ons; and begin to
con&s;ider within my&s;elf, in what manner we have &s;pent our time for the&s;e
four years pa&s;t, and what profit we are likely to receive hereafter from
the&s;e our academical &s;tudies: But upon retro&s;pection I find that
in&s;tead of having laid up a &s;tore of learning, which might have been of
&s;ervice to us in our future connections and intercour&s;e with mankind, we
have been confounding our heads with a mi&s;cellaneous heap of non&s;en&s;e,
which mo&s;t of us, I am certain, are endeavouring to unlearn as 
<PB N="644" REF="219"> fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible we can: in&s;tead of having
acquired &s;uch a &s;hare of common &s;en&s;e, as might have been of &s;ervice
to our&s;elves and acquaintance, we mu&s;t entirely &s;ell off our old &s;tock,
and begin the world of literature anew. This re|flection cannot be very
plea&s;ing to tho&s;e, who I mu&s;t &s;ay have &s;quandered away &s;o very
precious a time of life; a time of life, when, though judgment perhaps is not
come to maturity, yet imagination and invention, tho&s;e noble off|&s;prings of
a promi&s;ing mind, are in the very flower and bloom of perfection.</P>
<P>THIS &s;eat of learning (for it undoubtedly de&s;erves that
name) has drawn and kept us together for &s;ome years; our manners,
conver&s;ation, and &s;tudies bear a great &s;imilitude: but now either chance
or choice is going to di&s;per&s;e us over the whole kingdom; and our places of
abode will &s;carcely be more widely different, than our &s;chemes of life.
Notwith&s;tanding this, the &s;ame plan of &s;tudy has been im|po&s;ed on all:
Whether agreeable, or contrary to the bent of inclination, has never been
regarded. Mathematics is the &s;tandard, to which all merit is referred; and
all the excellencies, without the&s;e, are quite overlooked and neg|lected: the
&s;olid learning of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> is a trifling
acqui&s;ition; and much more &s;o, every polite accompli&s;hment: in &s;hort,
if you will not get all <HI>Euclid</HI> and his diagrams by heart, and pore
over <HI>Saunder&s;on</HI> 'till you are as blind as he was him&s;elf, they
will &s;ay of you, as in the motto to one of your late papers, <HI>actum e&s;t,
ilicet, peri&s;ti.</HI> Not that I would depreciate this kind of learning; it
is certainly a mo&s;t noble &s;cience, and reflects the greate&s;t honour on
human wit and invention: all that I complain of, is the unrea&s;on|able
&s;tre&s;s that is laid upon it; nay even the more ab&s;tru&s;e 
<PB N="645" REF="220"> parts of it: which is &s;till more ab&s;urd, as there
are &s;o very few heads able to perceive and retain the nice chain of
rea&s;oning and deduction, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be made u&s;e of, and
as a &s;mall number of mathematical geniu&s;&s;es would be &s;ufficient for the
&s;ervice of his Maje&s;ty's dominions.</P>
<P>I TAKE it for granted, that your &s;agacity has by this time
di&s;covered, that you have been addre&s;&s;ed by a young man, who&s;e
too-overweening conceit of him&s;elf has, perhaps, in|duced him to imagine,
that the Univer&s;ity has not &s;uffi|ciently rewarded his de&s;erts. If &s;o,
you are not deceived: but though this di&s;appointment may at pre&s;ent &s;et a
little unea&s;y upon me, yet I think I can fore&s;ee, that it will be the
mo&s;t fortunate mortification that could po&s;&s;ibly have befallen me. For,
in the fir&s;t place, it has &s;ufficiently abated that up&s;tart pride, which
mo&s;t young men are apt to take in their own abilities; than which nothing can
be more in&s;ufferable to all their acquaintance, or a greater impediment to
their own real improvement. A pert &s;cholar, whenever he enters a room of
company, immediately a&s;&s;umes a &s;uperiority in di&s;cour&s;e, and thinks
him&s;elf obliged to correct all impro|prieties in thought or expre&s;&s;ion.
You mu&s;t 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;peak by the card,"</Q> as <HI>Hamlet</HI>
&s;ays, or expect the cen&s;ure of this &s;uper|ficial coxcomb. If, according
to the common form of &s;peech, you &s;ay that there is either heat in fire, or
coldne&s;s in ice, he will inform you, that you deliver your&s;elf very
inaccurately, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> has fully demon&s;trated; he will tell you,
you cannot prove, that two and two make four, or that you are alive your&s;elf.
The&s;e, and a thou&s;and other equally impertinent ob&s;ervations, he is
continually making, to the no &s;mall unea&s;ine&s;s and perplexity of the
ladies, and hone&s;t country gentlemen.</P>
<P><PB N="646" REF="221">WHAT is &s;till a greater misfortune, is
that a man of this ca&s;t is never likely to know any better: for having raked
together a few metaphy&s;ical di&s;tinctions and &s;chola&s;tic re|finements,
he thinks, he has laid up a &s;ufficient fund of knowledge for his whole life:
he de&s;pi&s;es all common &s;en&s;e (which is the be&s;t &s;en&s;e) through an
ambition of appearing particular; and as for the advice or opinion of others,
tho&s;e he thinks him&s;elf indi&s;pen&s;ably bound to di&s;regard; ina&s;|much
as &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion implies &s;ome inferiority, which he would by no
means be thought to labour under. Such a di&s;po&s;ition as this, I take to be
the &s;ure and infallible token of confirmed ignorance: a melancholy in&s;tance
of the de|pravity of human nature, that the le&s;s we know, the more we
pre&s;ume; and the fewer advances we have made to|wards true knowledge, the
le&s;s occa&s;ion we think we have of any further improvement.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, if I may be allowed to judge of what I
cannot po&s;&s;ibly have experienced, I take it to be the greate&s;t benefit to
a young per&s;on to meet with early di&s;ap|pointments in life: for &s;ooner or
later every one mu&s;t have his &s;hare of them; and the &s;ooner we meet with
&s;ome of them, the better: for by this means the mind is ea&s;ily made
familiar with cro&s;&s;es and vexations, and is not thrown off its balance by
every thwarting and wayward accident. By this means, we &s;ubmit to ills and
troubles, as the nece&s;&s;ary attendants on mankind; ju&s;t as on a rainy day
we make our&s;elves quiet and contented, but hope for &s;un&s;hine on the
morrow. And, indeed, there &s;eems to be a &s;trong analogy between the
inclemency of the weather attacking our bo|dies, and the &s;torms of
afflictions which batter our minds. <PB N="647" REF="222"> The rain will beat,
and the wind will roar, let us u&s;e our utmo&s;t endeavours to the contrary;
but by enuring our per|&s;ons to the vici&s;&s;itudes of the &s;ea&s;ons, and
u&s;ing other pro|per methods, we &s;hall feel no very &s;en&s;ible
inconvenience from them: In like manner all our &s;kill and art cannot prevent
or elude the rubs and di&s;a&s;ters to which we are lia|ble; but if by degrees,
and early in life, we are hardened and accu&s;tomed to them, and if by the help
of rea&s;on and &s;ound philo&s;ophy we arm and fortify our&s;elves again&s;t
them, they may &s;till perhaps reach us; but their &s;hocks will be quite weak
and languid, and we may &s;ay of Fortune, as <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;ays of

<P>I Am &s;o great an admirer of the fair &s;ex, that I never let
a tittle of their vendible writings e&s;cape me. I bought this year the
<HI>Lady</HI>'s <HI>Diary,</HI> merely becau&s;e it was adver|ti&s;ed as the
<HI>Woman</HI>'s <HI>Almanack,</HI> which I con&s;trued, the Al|manack
compo&s;ed by a Woman: but I find I have been mi&s;taken in my &s;uppo&s;ition.
It is not the work of a female. The Chri&s;tian name of the author, I have
rea&s;on to believe, is <HI>Marmaduke</HI>; unle&s;s I mi&s;under&s;tand a
mo&s;t curious copy of ver&s;es, de&s;cribing a mo&s;t &s;uperb entertainment,
of fi&s;h, fle&s;h, pies, and tarts, exhibited upon New Year's Day 1755. His
Sirname remains as great an Aenigma as any in his book. His coadjutors,
contributers, or a&s;&s;i&s;tants are Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Walter Trott, Timothy
Nabb, Patrick Ocavannah, John Honey,</HI> <PB N="648" REF="223"> <HI>Henry
Sea&s;on,</HI> and others. I honour the&s;e gentlemen, and their works; but I
own my chief delight is in reading over the Riddles, and Unriddles, the
Que&s;tions, and the An&s;wers of Mi&s;s <HI>Sally We&s;t, Caelia,</HI> Mi&s;s
<HI>Nancy Evelyn,</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>E. S.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Atkin&s;on, Enira,</HI>
and other choice little feminine &s;pirits of the age. Riddles are &s;o
becoming, and appear &s;o pretty, when dandled about by ladies, that they may
be compared to &s;oft, &s;mooth, painted waxen babbies, dre&s;&s;ed up in a
pro|per manner for Mi&s;&s;es to play with, from eighteen to four|&s;core. But
above all I mu&s;t take this opportunity of congra|tulating dear Mi&s;s
<HI>Fanny Harris,</HI> who, I find, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>has given an elegant Solution to a Prize
Problem by a Fluxionary Cal|culus founded on the Properties of
Tangents,</HI>"</Q> and by that means has run away with no le&s;s than twelve
Diaries for this important year 1756. As this young lady is ju&s;tly called the

<Q REND="inline">"honour of her &s;ex,"</Q> and deals entirely
in the Properties of Tangents, I fear &s;he will never de&s;cend &s;o low as
<HI>Riddleme Riddlemeree,</HI> and therefore I mu&s;t humbly offer, by the
vehi|cle of your paper, Mr. TOWN, a &s;mall Riddle, invented with much pains
and thought by my&s;elf, to the &s;olution of tho&s;e three ingenious
Spin&s;ters, Mi&s;s <HI>Polly Walker,</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Grace Tetlow,</HI> and

<SALUTE>Mr. TOWN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU mu&s;t know, Sir, in my younger days I was very
&s;u&s;ceptible of the pa&s;&s;ion of love: my heart was al|ways fluttering,
jumping, and &s;kipping, when a female object was in view: and being a pretty
good ma&s;ter of that <PB N="650" REF="225"> kind of romantic non&s;en&s;e,
with which the fair are too often captivated; being fond of dancing,
fri&s;king, capering, and fidgeting to all public places; I gained the
affections of many, but could &s;ettle to none: and my heart con&s;tantly
returned to its owner with the wound healed.</P>
<P>IN this manner I lived till I grew pa&s;t forty; and think|ing
&s;uch kind of life not &s;o agreeable, but rather fatiguing, I came to a
re&s;olution to marry, and &s;ettle quietly in the world the remainder of my
days. You may gue&s;s from my general acquaintance, I could not be a great
while before I had an opportunity offered of meeting &s;omething &s;uitable to
my inclinations: accordingly I fixed my mind on a widow lady about ten years
younger than my&s;elf; to whom I made known my intentions as &s;oon as I could.
I was received in &s;uch a manner as all happy lovers would wi&s;h to be: and
at la&s;t got her promi&s;e for the completion: but when I pre&s;|&s;ed the
day, was told it could not be &s;o &s;oon as I de&s;ired; for to &s;urrender on
&s;o &s;hort a court&s;hip, the world might impute as an indecorum in her
character.</P>
<P>I MUST tell you, I &s;oon found (like <HI>Malvolio</HI> in the
play) that &s;he had a great pa&s;&s;ion for white &s;ilk &s;tockings; and you
may be &s;ure I always dre&s;&s;ed my legs in that colour: but as ill luck
would have it, &s;ome little time &s;ince, having &s;tayed with her pretty
late, and not being able to get either coach or chair, I was forced to trudge
home in the rain, my cur&s;ed white &s;tockings were wet from top to bottom;
the next morning the rheumati&s;m took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of my knees,
which not only cau&s;ed an hobble in my gait, but obliged me to cloath my legs
with thick ribb'd wor&s;ted for the &s;ake of warmth.</P>
<P><PB N="651" REF="226">THUS hobbling and cloathed, I went to
vi&s;it my charmer, who as I entered the room was &s;itting in her chair more
grave than u&s;ual; which I imputed to her attention to do|me&s;tic affairs,
and &s;at down by her. I took hold of her hand, and was going to intrude on her
lips for a ki&s;s&mdash;But would you think it, Mr. TOWN! in&s;tead of
&s;uffering my &s;a|lute, &s;he reclined her head on the chair; drew her hand
from mine; held it up as a bar between us; aro&s;e; and told me I mu&s;t take
no &s;uch liberties in future. I expo&s;tulated; and was for attempting again,
imagining it was only a whim, (for you well know they all have their whims) but
to my great misfortune found it was real. She re&s;umed her place; and in a
grave manner told me, I mu&s;t think no more of what had pa&s;&s;ed between us;
that &s;he &s;hould al|ways have a regard for me, but was determined not to
marry; and therefore expected I &s;hould from that time for|bear all further
preten&s;ion. I earne&s;tly (as you can make no doubt) pre&s;&s;ed for
rea&s;ons, but could get none except broken hints; &s;uch as&mdash;I would not
have you marry&mdash;It may hurt your con&s;titution, which &s;eems to be very
delicate&mdash;I cannot turn Nur&s;e&mdash;We &s;hall not an&s;wer each others
expectations&mdash;and without any further or other ceremony, &s;he quitted the
room with all the haughty airs of a fine lady, who knows &s;he has the man
totally in her power.</P>
<P>OH Mr. TOWN! imagine what a confu&s;ed &s;ituation I was in: I
was thunder-&s;truck: I was over-whelmed with horror and a&s;toni&s;hment: I
&s;tood like the Soldier when he beheld the &s;hocking condition of his General
<HI>Belli&s;arius.</HI> After being a long time in that condition, I a little
recovered my &s;en&s;es; and with much difficulty prevailed on her maid, to 
<PB N="652" REF="227"> follow her to her retreat; and to beg the favour only to
&s;peak to her. That was denied me; I was told her determination was fixed;
&s;he expected I would obey it; and that &s;he &s;hould be ab&s;ent when I came
again.</P>
<P>I AM at pre&s;ent uncertain what to do: I &s;hall therefore be
obliged to you, if you will advi&s;e me, (as I can prove a promi&s;e of
marriage) whether I &s;hall put the affair into the hands of my attorney: or
whether I &s;hall &s;tay till the warm weather comes (which I imagine will
carry off my rheu|mati&s;m) and attack her again: or whether I &s;hall pocket
the di&s;appointment, and think no more of matrimony. Give me &s;ome
con&s;olation if you can: but if you have none, I de&s;ire, for the good of
young batchelors like my&s;elf, you would ad|vi&s;e them all between forty and
fifty not to wear white &s;tock|ings in winter.</P>

<P>AS there are &s;ome vices, which the vulgar have pre|&s;umed
to copy from the great, &s;o there are others, which the great have
conde&s;cended to borrow from the vul|gar. Among the&s;e I cannot but &s;et
down the black-guard practice (for &s;o I mu&s;t call it) of Cur&s;ing and
Swearing: a practice, which (to &s;ay nothing at pre&s;ent of its
profanene&s;s) is low and indelicate, and places a man of quality on the &s;ame
level with the chairman at his door. For my own part I cannot &s;ee the
difference between a <HI>By Gad</HI> or a <HI>Dem-me</HI> minced and &s;oftened
by a gentle pronunciation from well-bred lips, and the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion
bluntly bolted out from the broad mouth of a carman or an oy&s;ter-wench.</P>
<P><PB N="653" REF="228">YOUR predece&s;&s;or the SPECTATOR has
given us an account of a &s;elect party of Swearers, who were extremely
&s;urpri&s;ed at their own common talk, which was taken down in &s;hort|hand,
and afterwards repeated to them. In like manner, if we were to draw out a
catalogue of fa&s;hionable Oaths and Cur&s;es in pre&s;ent u&s;e at
<HI>Arthur</HI>'s or any other polite a&s;&s;embly, would not the company
them&s;elves be led to imagine, that the conver&s;ation had been carried on
between the lowe&s;t of the mob? Would they not blu&s;h to find, that they had
gleaned their choice&s;t phra&s;es from &s;treets and allies, and en|riched
their di&s;cour&s;e by the elegant dialect of <HI>Wapping</HI> or <HI>Broad
Saint Giles</HI>'s?</P>
<P>I SHALL purpo&s;ely wave making any reflections on the
im|piety of this practice, as I am &s;atisfied they would have but little
weight either with the <HI>beau-monde</HI> or the <HI>canaille.</HI> The
Swearer of either &s;tation devotes him&s;elf piece-meal (as it were) to
de&s;truction; pours out anathemas again&s;t his eyes, his heart, his &s;oul,
and every part of his body; and extends the &s;ame good wi&s;hes to the limbs
and joints of his friends and acquaintance. This they both do with the &s;ame
fearle&s;s unconcern; but with this difference only, that the
Gentle|man-Swearer damns him&s;elf and others with the greate&s;t ci|vility and
good-breeding imaginable.</P>
<P>I KNOW it will be pleaded in excu&s;e for this practice, that
Oaths and Cur&s;es are intended only as mere expletives, to fill up and give a
grace to conver&s;ation: but as there are &s;till &s;ome old-fa&s;hioned
creatures, who adhere to their common acceptation, it would be proper to
&s;ub&s;titute &s;ome other un|meaning terms in their room, and at the &s;ame
time remote from the vulgar Cur&s;ing and Swearing. A worthy clergy|man 
<PB N="654" REF="229"> (who&s;e name I cannot recollect) being chaplain of a
regiment, is &s;aid to have reclaimed the officers, who were much addicted to
the vulgar idiom of &s;wearing, by taking occa&s;ion to tell them a &s;tory, in
which he introduced the words <HI>bottle and gla&s;s,</HI> in&s;tead of the
u&s;ual expletives of <HI>God, Devil,</HI> and <HI>damn,</HI> which he did not
think quite &s;o becoming for one of <HI>his cloth</HI> to make free with. The
&s;ame method might, I imagine, be followed by our people of fa&s;hion,
whenever they are obliged to have recour&s;e to the like &s;ub&s;ti|tutes for
thought. <HI>Bottle and gla&s;s</HI> might be u&s;ed with great energy in the
table-talk at the <HI>King's Arms</HI> or <HI>Saint Alban's</HI> ta|verns: the
game&s;ter might be indulged in &s;wearing by the <HI>Knave of Clubs,</HI> or
the <HI>Cur&s;e of Scotland;</HI> or he might with &s;ome propriety retain the
old execration of <HI>the Deuce take it:</HI> the beau &s;hould be allowed to 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;wear by his gracious &s;elf, which is the
god of his idolatry;"</Q> and the common ex|pletives of conver&s;ation &s;hould
con&s;i&s;t only of <HI>upon my word,</HI> or <HI>upon my honour</HI>; which,
whatever &s;en&s;e they might for|merly bear, are at pre&s;ent under&s;tood

<P>_IT is not ea&s;y for the mind of man to recover it&s;elf from
any extraordinary panic which has once &s;eized it: for this rea&s;on we
can|not be &s;urpri&s;ed, that many well-meaning people, who have not yet
&s;hook off the ap|prehen&s;ions occa&s;ioned by the late dreadful earthquakes,
&s;hould be led to conjure up new terrors, and alarm them|&s;elves with
imaginary dangers. Their fears interpret every common incident, and even the
change of weather, as &s;igns of approaching de&s;truction: if the day be calm
and &s;erene, &s;uch (they &s;ay) is the u&s;ual fore-runner of a &s;hock; or
if the <PB N="656" REF="231"> night prove tempe&s;tuous, they can hardly
per&s;uade them|&s;elves that it is only the wind which rocks their hou&s;es.
With this propen&s;ity to entertain any unrea&s;onable dread about future
events, it is no wonder, that weak minds &s;hould be further worked upon by
little dablers in philo&s;o|phy; who having gleaned a few barren &s;craps from
the Magazines, pre&s;ume even to foretell the di&s;&s;olution of the world by
the Comet which will appear in 1758. <HI>Swift,</HI> in his <HI>Voyage to
Laputa,</HI> has a pa&s;&s;age &s;o very appo&s;ite to the&s;e idle pretenders
to &s;cience, that I &s;hall beg leave to tran&s;cribe it.</P>
<Q> 
<P> THESE people (&s;ays he) are under continual di&s;qui|etudes,
never enjoying a minute's peace of mind; and their di&s;turbances proceed from
cau&s;es, which very little affect the re&s;t of mortals. Their apprehen&s;ions
ari&s;e from &s;everal changes they dread in the cele&s;tial bodies. For
in&s;tance, that the earth by the continual approaches of the &s;un towards it
mu&s;t in cour&s;e of time be ab&s;orbed, or &s;wallowed up. That the face of
the &s;un will by degrees be encru&s;ted with its own effluvia, and give no
more light to the world. That the earth very narrowly e&s;caped a bru&s;h from
the la&s;t comet, which would have infallibly reduced it to a&s;hes; and that
the next, which they have calculated for one and thirty years hence, will
probably de|&s;troy us. For, if in its perihelion it &s;hould approach with|in
a certain degree of the &s;un (as by their calculations they have rea&s;ons to
dread) it will receive a degree of heat ten thou&s;and times more inten&s;e,
than that of red hot glowing iron; and, in its ab&s;ence from the &s;un carry a
blazing tail ten hundred thou&s;and and fourteen miles long; through which if
the earth &s;hould pa&s;s at the di&s;tance of one hun|dred thou&s;and miles
from the <HI>nucleus,</HI> or main body of <PB N="657" REF="232"> the comet, it
mu&s;t in its pa&s;&s;age be &s;et on fire, and re|duced to a&s;hes. That the
&s;un, daily &s;pending its rays without any nutriment to &s;upply them, will
at la&s;t be wholly con&s;umed and annihilated; which mu&s;t be attend|ed with
the de&s;truction of this earth and of all the planets that receive their light
from it.</P> 
<P> THEY are &s;o perpetually alarmed with the apprehen&s;ions of
the&s;e, and the like impending dangers, that they can neither &s;leep quietly
in their beds, nor have any reli&s;h for the common plea&s;ures or amu&s;ements
of life. When they meet an acquaintance in the morning, the fir&s;t que&s;tion
is about the &s;un's health, how he looked at his &s;etting and ri&s;ing, and
what hopes they have to avoid the &s;troke of an approaching comet. This
conver&s;ation they are apt to run into with the &s;ame temper, that boys
di&s;cover to hear terrible &s;tories of &s;pirits and hobgoblins, which they
greedily li&s;ten to, and dare not go to bed for fear.</P></Q>
<P>LET us therefore bani&s;h from our thoughts all &s;uch vain
notions, and let us fortify our minds with a true &s;en&s;e of religion, which
will teach us to rely on the protection of that providence, which has hitherto
pre&s;erved us. It is with great plea&s;ure, that I remarked the unanimous
concur|rence of all ranks of people, in ob&s;erving the late &s;olemn Fa&s;t,
as a nece&s;&s;ary act of humiliation, to avert the wrath and vengeance of
heaven, and to call down its mercies upon us: nor do I doubt, but the
approaching Sea&s;on will awaken in us the &s;ame &s;erious attention to our
duty; that we may not &s;eem to have barely complied with a &s;tated form, or
to have been affected with the &s;hort-lived piety of a &s;ingle day.</P>
<P><PB N="658" REF="233">IT is true, indeed, that no per&s;ons do
more prejudice to the cau&s;e of religion, than they who cloud its genuine
chearfulne&s;s with the gloom of &s;uper&s;tition, and are apt to con&s;ider
every common accident that befalls us, as a judg|ment. They cloath religion in
the mo&s;t terrifying habit, and (as it were, dre&s;s it up in all the horrors
of the Inqui&s;ition. The&s;e people are much to be pitied; and it is to be
wi&s;hed, that their mi&s;taken piety could be better regulated. But there is
another &s;et of men of a different turn, more nume|rous and much more
dangerous to the community, who treat every act of religion as a je&s;t, and
hold its mo&s;t &s;acred ordinances in contempt. Set forms and ceremonies,
though they have no e&s;&s;ential virtue in them&s;elves, are yet
indi&s;pen|&s;ably requi&s;ite to keep alive in us a quick &s;en&s;e of our
duty. It mu&s;t be allowed, indeed, that if a man could con&s;tantly employ his
mind in holy meditations, exerci&s;e the virtues, and believe the my&s;teries
of our religion, he would be a true Chri&s;tian, though he never complied with
any outward forms, or &s;o much as repeated a &s;ingle prayer. But it is
manife&s;t from experience, that tho&s;e who neglect the ordi|nances, neglect
al&s;o the duties of a Chri&s;tian; and the lea&s;t reflection on the human
mind will convince us, that &s;ome external rites are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ettle
the wandering ideas, and to fix the attention on its proper object. The fervent
re|petition of a prayer is apt to in&s;pire us with love and gra|titude towards
the DEITY, and kindles the &s;parks of devo|tion within us: and it is ea&s;y to
conceive, that if the cele|bration of public wor&s;hip was neglected among us
only for one year, it would be a more fatal blow to religion than all the weak
attacks of infidels and free-thinkers. No argu|ments, therefore, could be more
ill-grounded than the ob|jections <PB N="659" REF="234"> of tho&s;e people, who
con&s;idered the appointment of the late &s;olemn fa&s;t as u&s;ele&s;s and
unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>BUT though forms may be &s;aid to compo&s;e the body, a good
life is the &s;oul of religion, without which the re&s;t is but a dead ma&s;s.
The mo&s;t rigid compliance with every ordinance of the Church, if it has no
influence on our con|duct, is rather a &s;olemn mockery than an attonement for
our offences: as they, who receive the bread and wine without a firm
re&s;olution to lead a new life, are &s;aid to eat and drink their own
damnation: Wherefore, a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of this or that particular day is
not a &s;ufficient di&s;charge of our duty, except it &s;erve to rouze us from
the lethargy of &s;in, to awaken in us a de&s;ire of becoming worthy the
protection of the ALMIGHTY, by animating our faith, amending our lives, and
working in us a repentance of our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. Thus the Lord's Day is
not merely &s;et apart for devotion, with an unlimited licence to wickedne&s;s
all the re&s;t of the week; but our being particularly exerci&s;ed in acts of
piety for one day, is calculated to &s;trengthen our virtue, and to give a
tincture of religion to our whole conduct through the other &s;ix.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations I have thought fit to lay before the
reader, as preparatory to another &s;olemn Fa&s;t ordained by the Church: and
if the ob&s;ervance of this &s;hould be neg|lected or &s;lightly pa&s;&s;ed
over, may we not conclude, that our &s;en&s;e of religion is only in proportion
to our &s;en&s;e of danger? As for tho&s;e, who require con&s;tantly to be
fright|ened into their duty, I will for once venture to commence prophet: and
let them be a&s;&s;ured that my predictions will in|fallibly come to pa&s;s.
There is a danger, more certain than an <PB N="660" REF="235"> Earthquake or a
Comet, which will inevitably overwhelm us; from which we cannot po&s;&s;ibly
guard our&s;elves, and which perhaps is even now at our doors. This danger I
cannot better &s;et forth, than in the alarming words of a ce|lebrated
<HI>French</HI> preacher. 
<Q REND="inline">"I know a man (and I will point him out
pre&s;ently) who is now in this church; a man, in perfect health; a man, in the
flower of his age: And yet this man, perhaps before next Sunday, perhaps by
to-morrow, will be in his grave. This man, my dear brethren, is My&s;elf who
&s;peak to you, it is You who hear me."</Q></P>

<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_EVERY <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who has the good of his country
at heart, mu&s;t lament the per|plexity which our mini&s;ters labour under, in
contriving ways and means to rai&s;e money for the pre&s;ent exigence of
affairs. I have with plea&s;ure hearkened to the &s;everal projects propo&s;ed
in the debates of patriots in our coffee-hou&s;es and private clubs: but though
I find they are unanimous in allowing the nece&s;|&s;ity of levying new taxes,
every one is willing to &s;hift off the burthen from him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="662" REF="237">I WAS introduced the other night into a
&s;et of worthy citi|zens, who very zealou&s;ly took this &s;ubject into
con&s;ideration over their evening pipe. One of them a grave gentleman, pulling
the <HI>Evening Po&s;t</HI> out of his pocket, and putting on his &s;pectacles,
read aloud to us the &s;everal methods already propo&s;ed; to which many wi&s;e
objections were immediately &s;tarted by the company. 
<Q REND="inline">"What's that? &s;ays an old don, (who I
afterwards found had a &s;mall e&s;tate in hou&s;es) An additional duty upon
bricks, and pan-tiles, and plain-tiles, I &s;uppo&s;e they will lay a tax upon
plain-tile-pegs by and bye?"</Q> This &s;peech was received with an hearty
chuckle of applau&s;e from the re&s;t of the company; when another took
occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he very much approved the &s;cheme for
laying a larger tax upon cards and dice; one of which he called the <HI>devil's
books,</HI> and the other his <HI>bones.</HI>"</Q> The duty upon plate might
perhaps have pa&s;&s;ed into a law in this a&s;&s;embly, if it had not been
vehe|mently oppo&s;ed by one member, (whom I di&s;covered to be a
&s;ilver-&s;mith,) in which he was &s;econded by the landlord of the hou&s;e,
who had a &s;eat in this meeting, and told us, 
<Q REND="inline">"that it would lye very hard upon publicans,
as nobody would now drink their porter out of a pewter-pot."</Q> The&s;e and
the like arguments induced us to &s;et a&s;ide all the pro|jects, that had been
offered hitherto and to con&s;ult together in order to find new ones in their
room; among which I could not but &s;mile at the propo&s;al of an hone&s;t
peruke-ma|ker, who advi&s;ed the levying of a poll-tax upon all that wore their
own hair, 
<Q REND="inline">"For, &s;ays he, we have never had good times,
&s;ince wigs were out of fa&s;hion. What rare days were tho&s;e in Queen
<HI>Anne</HI>'s reign, when the nobility and gentry wore large flaxen flows of
thirty guineas price! And <PB N="663" REF="238"> as you may &s;ee in my lord
<HI>Godolphin</HI>'s monument in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI> Abby, a prime
mini&s;ter's wig, could not be made, I am &s;ure, under fifty guineas."</Q></P>
<P>THE di&s;cour&s;e that pa&s;&s;ed at this &s;ociety of
politicians has led me to turn my thoughts on devi&s;ing &s;ome method, that
might an&s;wer the pre&s;ent demands for a &s;upply, with the lea&s;t injury to
the community. On this account I am of Opinion that private vices (according to
the favourite tenet of <HI>Maun|derville)</HI> may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be
converted into public benefits, by laying a certain tax or duty on the
fa&s;hionable amu&s;ements of the gay and polite world. For this purpo&s;e I
have with great pains and labour contrived a plan, a few heads of which,
without further preface, I &s;hall (with your leave) &s;ubmit to the
con&s;ideration of tho&s;e whom it may concern.</P>
<P>FIRST then, I would propo&s;e, that no per&s;ons of quality,
or others, &s;hould be allowed to keep any route, drum, a&s;|&s;embly,
vi&s;iting-day, (or whatever other name it may here|after be called by,) at
which more than one hundred per&s;ons &s;hall be found a&s;&s;embled, without
paying a certain rate for every &s;uch route, drum, &amp;c. The number of
the&s;e meet|ings, which are held in this town, (including the city of
<HI>London</HI> and the &s;uburbs thereof) I have computed, upon an exact
calculation, to amount annually to eight thou&s;and three hundred and upwards;
&s;o that if a duty, at only &s;ix-pence <HI>per</HI> head, were to be levied
upon the company, it would bring in a prodigious income to the government;
deducting for the decrea&s;e con&s;equent of this tax, as al&s;o for tho&s;e
which we may expect will be &s;muggled or carried on clande&s;|tinely. And as
gaming is an e&s;&s;ential diver&s;ion at all the&s;e meetings, I would further
advi&s;e, that every card-table be <PB N="664" REF="239"> marked and numbered,
in the &s;ame manner as waggons and coaches, and a proportionable rate fixed on
them according to the degree and quality of the owners. Be it enacted moreover,
that extraordinary licences &s;hall be taken out for playing at cards on the
Sabbath-day; but that the&s;e be granted only to per&s;ons of the highe&s;t
rank and fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>AT the pre&s;ent juncture of affairs every one will agree with
me, that if an ab&s;olute prohibition be impracticable, an heavy duty &s;hould
be laid on the importation of <HI>French</HI> fa&s;hions and fopperies into
this kingdom. It is therefore but rea&s;onable, that all <HI>French</HI> cooks,
valets de chambre, mil|liners, mantua-makers, hair-cutters, &amp;c. &s;hould be
at lea&s;t doubly taxed, as it is notorious that they exact from the dupes, who
employ them, more than double the wages or price for their labours, that our
own mode&s;t countrymen would re|quire. This tax I make no doubt, would produce
no incon|&s;iderable &s;um for the public u&s;e: and as our ladies, though I
would not &s;u&s;pect that they have <HI>French</HI> hearts, are ambi|tious of
wearing <HI>French</HI> complexions, a further &s;um might al&s;o be rai&s;ed
by fixing an high duty upon <HI>rouge</HI> and <HI>carmine.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL not dwell on other particulars, which might be turned
in the &s;ame manner to the public good; &s;uch as a tax on kept
mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, for example, which practice is now become &s;o generally
fa&s;hionable, that I que&s;tion not but a duty properly levied on them would
be &s;ufficient to maintain all the widows of our &s;oldiers and &s;ailors, who
&s;hall happen to be killed in the &s;ervice. But as it is incumbent on every
<HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> to expo&s;e his life in defence of his country again&s;t
the common enemy, I mu&s;t particularly re|commend, that &s;ome means may be
devi&s;ed, that the gallant <PB N="665" REF="240"> feats of tho&s;e men of
honour, who rather chu&s;e to ri&s;k their lives in the modi&s;h way of
duelling, may be attended with &s;ome advantage to their countrymen. I would
therefore ad|vi&s;e, that &s;words and pi&s;tols of a &s;ettled length and
bore, with the Tower-&s;tamp, be provided by the government for the u&s;e of
Duelli&s;ts, and that they &s;hall not pre&s;ume to make u&s;e of any other,
under pain of incurring the guilt of murder. The&s;e weapons may be let out at
a certain price; and if one of the parties happen to kill the other, the
&s;ur|vivor &s;hall be &s;ubject to a fine according to his rank and &s;tation,
and a jury &s;hall be directed to bring in the ver|dict, <HI>Self-Defence.</HI>
In like manner, per&s;ons of quality may have leave granted them to put an end
to their own lives, after an ill luck at cards, or the like emergent
occa|&s;ions; when, upon paying a certain rate, they may be in|dulged in a
private execution from the hands of <HI>Jack Ketch,</HI> and the Coroner's
inque&s;t &s;hall be directed to bring in their verdict, <HI>Lunacy.</HI></P>

<P>_THE generality of the young unmarried ladies of the pre&s;ent
age di&s;like no company &s;o much as the elderly per&s;ons of their own &s;ex,
whether married or unmarried. Go|ing with an old maiden aunt, a mamma, or
grand-mamma to the play, or to <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> is &s;o in&s;ipid an
amu&s;ement, that it robs their entertainment of the very name of a party of
plea&s;ure. To be handed into a box, walk in the public gardens, or make one at
a card-table at a route, with a &s;prightly young nobleman, or gallant colonel
of the guards, has &s;ome life in it; but to be kept perpetually under the wing
of an old lady, can have no charms for a woman of &s;pirit. The pre&s;ence of
the&s;e antiquated females impo&s;es a con&s;traint on their behaviour: they
are, indeed, like the <PB N="668" REF="243"> <HI>Duennas</HI> in
<HI>Spain,</HI> &s;pies on the conduct of the gay and young; and a good old
gentlewoman with a young beauty by her &s;ide watches her every motion, and is
as much frighted, if the pretty creature makes any advances to a man, as a hen,
who has been fo&s;ter-mother to a brood of duck|lings, is alarmed at their
taking to the water.</P>
<P>BUT though a loo&s;e coquet behaviour is &s;o much in vogue, a
mode&s;t deportment is mo&s;t natural and becoming in the fair &s;ex; and I am
always glad to &s;ee a young lady of &s;ufficient &s;en&s;e and di&s;cretion,
to behave with an innocent chearfulne&s;s, in&s;tead of apparent unea&s;ine&s;s
and con&s;traint, before her more aged female friends and relations. But though
a daughter &s;hould prefer no company to her mother, a &s;on would appear as
ridiculous, if he always dangled at the &s;ide of his mamma, as if he wore his
&s;i&s;ter's petticoats: and however amiable this maidenly demeanor might
&s;eem in a young girl, I cannot view it with equal approbation in the
character of a Male-Virgin;&mdash;a character, with which I &s;hall here
pre&s;ent the reader, as drawn by one of my cor|re&s;pondents.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have already given us &s;everal in&s;tances of tho&s;e
am|biguous creatures among the men, who are both male and female: permit me to
add to them an account of tho&s;e lady-like gentlemen, whom we may
di&s;tingui&s;h by the title of <HI>their mother's own &s;ons</HI>; who have in
vain changed the bib and leading-&s;trings for the breeches, and &s;tick as
clo&s;e to their mammas, as a great calf to the &s;ide of an old cow. I am
intimately acquainted with one of the&s;e over-grown ba|bies; 
<PB N="669" REF="244"> who is indeed too big to be dandled in lap, or fed with
a pap-&s;poon, though he is no more weaned from his mother, than if he had not
yet quitted the nur&s;ery.</P>
<P>THE delicate BILLY SUCKLING is the contempt of the men, the
je&s;t of the women, and the darling of his mamma. She doats on him to
di&s;traction; and is in perpetual admi|ration of his wit, and anxiety for his
health. The good young gentleman, for his part, is neither undutiful nor
un|grateful: &s;he is the only woman, that he does not look on with
indifference; and &s;he is his tutore&s;s, his phy&s;ician, and his nur&s;e.
She provides his broth every evening, will not &s;uffer him to look into a book
by candle-light, le&s;t he &s;hould hurt his eyes; and takes care to have his
bed warmed: nay, I have known him &s;it with his mamma's white hand|kerchief
round his neck through a whole vi&s;it, to guard him from the wind of that
<HI>ugly door,</HI> or that <HI>terrible chink in the wain&s;cot.</HI></P>
<P>BUT however familiarly he may behave in his addre&s;&s;es to
his mother, and whatever little acts of gallantry may pa&s;s between them, no
encouragement can prevail on him to treat other women with the &s;ame freedom.
Being once de|&s;ired at a ball to dance a minuet, in&s;tead of taking out any
of the young ladies, he could pitch upon no partner &s;o agree|able, to whom he
might offer the compliment of his hand, as his mother; and I remember, when he
was once called upon in a large company at a tavern to give a lady in his turn,
he plainly &s;hewed who was the &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of his affections, by
toa&s;ting his mother. The gallant cu&s;tom of challenging a lady to drink a
bumper, by leaving it to her option whether &s;he will have <HI>hob</HI> or
<HI>nob,</HI> frequently gives a <PB N="670" REF="245"> delicious flavour to
the liquor, e&s;pecially when, as I have known it happen, joining the lips of
the gla&s;&s;es has made the prelude to a meeting between the lips of the
parties: but he could not be prevailed on to accept a gla&s;s of claret from
the faire&s;t hand, though a ki&s;s were &s;ure to follow it. I have known him
&s;o very nice, as to refu&s;e a gla&s;s of &s;ack filled with walnuts, which
had been peeled by the &s;nowy fingers of a beautiful young lady; though I have
&s;een him &s;mack his lips after a gla&s;s of rai&s;in wine, in which his
prudent mother had been dabbling with her &s;nuffy finger, in order to fi&s;h
out the &s;mall particles of cork, which might po&s;&s;ibly have choaked him.
If a lady drops her fan, he &s;its without any emotion, and &s;uffers her to
&s;toop for it her&s;elf; or if &s;he &s;trikes her tea-cup again&s;t the
&s;aucer to give notice that it is empty, he pays no regard to the &s;ignal,
but &s;ees her walk up to the tea-table, without &s;tirring from his chair. He
would rather leave the mo&s;t celebrated beauty, in cro&s;&s;ing the &s;treet,
to the mercy of a drayman, than tru&s;t her with his little finger: though at
the &s;ame time &s;hould his mother be &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, he would not
&s;cruple to bear as much of her weight as he could &s;tand under, and to
redeem her &s;ilk &s;tockings from jeopardy would even expo&s;e his own.</P>
<P>ONE would imagine, that this extreme coyne&s;s and re|&s;erve,
in which he &s;o remarkably differs from the generality of his own &s;ex, would
in another re&s;pect as effectually di&s;tin|gui&s;h him from the generality of
women: I mean, that being le&s;s polite in his addre&s;s than a footman, we
&s;hould hardly ex|pect to find him more loquacious than a chambermaid. But
this is really the ca&s;e. Suffer him to take the lead in conver|&s;ation, and
there are certain topicks, in which the mo&s;t <PB N="671" REF="246"> prating
go&s;&s;ip at a chri&s;tening would find it difficult to cope with him. The
&s;trength of his con&s;titution is his favourite theme: he is con&s;tantly
attempting to prove, that he is not &s;u&s;ceptible of the lea&s;t injury from
cold; though a hoar&s;e|ne&s;s in his voice, and the continual interruptions of
a con|&s;umptive cough, give him the lye in his throat at the end of every
&s;entence. The in&s;tances, indeed, by which he endeavours to prove his
hardine&s;s, unluckily rather tend to convince us of the delicacy of his frame,
as they &s;eldom amount to more, than his having kicked off the bed-choaths in
his &s;leep, laid a&s;ide one of his flannel wai&s;tcoats in a hot day, or
tried on a new pair of pumps before they had been &s;ufficiently aired. For the
truth of the&s;e facts he always appeals to his mamma, who vouches for him with
a &s;igh, and prote&s;ts that his carele&s;&s;ne&s;s would ruin the
con&s;titution of a hor&s;e.</P>
<P>I AM now coming to the mo&s;t extraordinary part of his
character. This pu&s;illanimous creature thinks him&s;elf, and would be
thought, a Buck. The noble fraternity of that order find, that their reputation
can be no otherwi&s;e main|tained, than by prevailing on an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>
chairman now and then to favour them with a broken head, or by conferring the
&s;ame token of their e&s;teem on the unarmed and defence|le&s;s waiters at a
tavern. But the&s;e exploits are by no means &s;uited to the di&s;po&s;ition of
our hero: and yet he always looks upon his harmle&s;s exploits as the bold
frolicks of a Buck. If he e&s;capes a nervous fever a month, he is quite a
Buck: if he walks home after it is dark, without his mamma's maid to attend
him, he is quite a Buck: if he &s;its up an hour later than his u&s;ual time,
or drinks a gla&s;s or two of wine without water, he calls it a debauch; and
becau&s;e his <PB N="672" REF="247"> head does not ache the next morning, he is
quite a Buck. In &s;hort, a woman of the lea&s;t &s;pirit within the precincts
of <HI>St. James</HI>'s would demoli&s;h him in a week, &s;hould be pretend to
keep pace with her in her irregularities: and yet he is ever dignifying
him&s;elf with the appellation of a Buck.</P>
<P>NOW might it not be giving this gentleman a u&s;eful hint, Mr.
TOWN, to a&s;&s;ure him, that while milk and water is his darling liquor, a
Bamboo cane his Club, and his mother the &s;ole object of his affections, the
world will never join in denominating him a Buck: That if he fails in this
attempt, he is ab&s;olutely excluded from every order in &s;ociety; for
whatever his de&s;erts may be, no a&s;&s;embly of antiquated virgins can ever
acknowledge him for a &s;i&s;ter, nature having as deplorably di&s;qualified
him for that rank in the commu|nity, as he has di&s;qualified him&s;elf for
every other: And that, though he never can arrive at the dignity of leading
apes in hell, he may po&s;&s;ibly be condemn'd to dangle in that capacity, at
the apron-&s;tring of an old maid in the next world, for having &s;o abominably
re&s;embled one in this.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT has for a long time been ob&s;ervable that the ladies
heads have run much upon wheels, but of late there has appeared a &s;trange
kind of inver&s;ion, for the wheels now run upon the ladies heads. As this
a&s;&s;ertion may probably puzzle many readers, who pay no attention to the
rapid and whim&s;ical revolutions of modern ta&s;te, it will be nece&s;&s;ary
to inform them that in&s;tead of a cap, the pre&s;ent mode is for every female
of fa&s;hion to load her head <PB N="674" REF="249"> with &s;ome kind of
carriage; whether they are made with broad wheels or not I cannot determine,
however, as they are undoubtedly excluded the Turnpike Act, it is by no means
material. Tho&s;e heads which are not able to bear a coach and &s;ix (for
vehicles of this &s;ort are very apt to crack the brain) &s;o far act
con&s;i&s;tently with prudence as to make u&s;e of a po&s;t chariot, or a
&s;ingle hor&s;e chai&s;e with a beau perching in the middle.</P>
<P>THE curio&s;ity I had of knowing the purport of this
inven|tion, and the general name of the&s;e machines led me to make enquiry
about them of a fa&s;hionable milliner at the court end of the town. She
obliged me with the &s;ight of one of the&s;e equipages, de&s;igned for the
head of a lady of quality, which I &s;urveyed with much admiration; and
pla|cing it on the palm of my hand, could not help fancying my&s;elf like
<HI>Gulliver</HI> taking up the Empre&s;s of <HI>Lilliput</HI> in her
&s;tate-coach. The vehicle it&s;elf was con&s;tructed of gold threads, and was
drawn by &s;ix dapple greys of blown gla&s;s, with a coachman, po&s;tilion, and
gentleman within, of the &s;ame brittle manufacture. Upon further enquiry, the
milli|ner told me with a &s;mile, that it was difficult to give a rea&s;on for
inventions &s;o full of whim, but that the name of this ornament (if it may be
called &s;uch) was a <HI>Capriole</HI> or <HI>Ca|briole</HI>; which we may
trace from the &s;ame original with our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> word
<HI>Caprice,</HI> both being derived from the <HI>French</HI> word
<HI>cabrer,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>to prance like an hor&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not to be doubted, but that this fa&s;hion took its
ri&s;e among the ladies from their fondne&s;s for equipage; and I dare &s;ay,
that every fair one, who carries a coach and &s;ix upon her head, would be glad
to be carried with equal &s;plen|dor <PB N="675" REF="250"> in a coach of her
own. I would, therefore propo&s;e a &s;cheme, which might render this
whim&s;ical mode of &s;ome kind of &s;ervice to both &s;exes; by which the
ladies may give a tacit hint of their inclinations without the lea&s;t breach
of mode&s;ty, the men may prevent the danger and inconvenience attending the
pre&s;ent method of advertising for wives, and the whole cour&s;e of a modern
court&s;hip may be carried on by means of this new head-dre&s;s.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of a <HI>Capriole</HI> &s;uppo&s;e this capital
decoration was called a <HI>Scutcheon</HI> of <HI>Pretence,</HI> which mu&s;t
not here be un|der&s;tood as a Term of <HI>Heraldry,</HI> but as an invitation
to ma|trimony. Thus if a lady pre&s;umes that &s;he has a right either from her
wit, beauty, merit, or fortune, to pretend to a &s;et of hor&s;es, let &s;ix
bright bays, blacks, or greys prance down one &s;ide of her head, and according
to the rank &s;he in&s;i&s;ts upon, let a ducal, or an earl's coronet, or a
bloody hand be di&s;tingui&s;hed upon her <HI>Capriole.</HI> The females of
le&s;s ambition may likewi&s;e expre&s;s their inclinations by a po&s;t|chariot
and pair; and even tho&s;e who, from a due con&s;i|deration of the low
condition of the funds, are &s;o con|de&s;cending as to &s;toop to a plain cit,
have nothing to do but to fix upon their heads a &s;ingle hor&s;e chai&s;e,
filled with a loving couple, &s;ticking as clo&s;e together as two dried figs.
As to tho&s;e who have ra&s;hly vowed virginity, if their great pronene&s;s to
cen&s;ure the re&s;t of their &s;ex, and the fretfulne&s;s of their a&s;pect,
be not &s;ufficient indications to keep the men at a di&s;tance, they may erect
upon their noddles a formal female &s;eated in a Sulky, fooli&s;hly plea&s;ed
with having the whole vehicle to her&s;elf, and awkwardly exerci&s;ing the
imaginary power of having the &s;ole command of the reins.</P>
<P><PB N="676" REF="251">AS a farther means of facilitating this
new method of court&s;hip, I mu&s;t beg leave to propo&s;e, that every lady's
bo&s;om &s;hould, in&s;tead of a pendent cro&s;s, which &s;avours of popery, be
ornamented with a chain and locket, &s;omething like tho&s;e bottle-tickets
which direct us to port, claret, or burgundy, upon which might be curiou&s;ly
engraved the numbers two hundred, five hundred, or a thou&s;and, accord|ing to
the &s;ettlement expected. But to tho&s;e female <HI>Quixotes</HI> who &s;corn
the <HI>Capriole,</HI> and erect <HI>Windmills</HI> upon their heads in&s;tead
of it, I &s;hall offer a word of advice worthy their atten|tion; which is, that
they would provide a pipe of commu|nication, to be conveyed from the&s;e
machines to the brain, and con&s;tituted upon the model of the ingenious Dr.
<HI>Hale</HI>'s ventilators, that, whenever the &s;ails of the Windmill are put
into motion by the external air, they may draw off all pernicious vapours which
may occa&s;ion a vertigo in the in&s;ide, as well as on the out&s;ide of their
heads.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, your humble &s;ervant,
H.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I AM much plea&s;ed with the propo&s;al of my ingenious
corre&s;pondent, and think it particularly well adapted to the pre&s;ent
di&s;po&s;ition of the ladies. A fondne&s;s for &s;howy equipages is now become
one of their darling pa&s;&s;ions; and the &s;plendor in which they are to be
maintained &s;eems to be one of the chief con&s;iderations in modern matches.
If a fine lady can be carried to court in a chair richly ornamented, or roll to
the opera in a gilt chariot, &s;he little considers with how di&s;agreeable a
companion &s;he goes through the journey of life: and a polite female would no
more fix her affections on a man, who drives but a beggarly pair, than &s;he
could be content to be tumbled down to his country &s;eat, like
<HI>Punch</HI>'s wife to <HI>Rumford,</HI> in a wheel-borrow.</P>
<P><PB N="677" REF="252">BUT as the ladies have &s;trongly
manife&s;ted this pa&s;&s;ion for equipage, the gentlemen, I &s;uppo&s;e out of
mere gal|lantry, and in order to further the gratification of their de|&s;ires,
have taken great pains to convert them&s;elves into coachmen, grooms, and
jockies. The flapped hat, the jemmy frock with plate buttons and a leathern
belt, and the pride which &s;ome young men of quality take in driving, are all
calculated the better to qualify them for being the ladies humble &s;ervants. I
am therefore for extending my corre|&s;pondent's &s;cheme: and as the ladies
now adorn their heads with the &s;ign of a coach and &s;ix, like the door of a
<HI>Meu&s;e</HI> alehou&s;e, I would have the gentlemen al&s;o bear the&s;e
emble|matical vehicles; by which the other &s;ex may, by a &s;ingle glance at a
lover's head, &s;ee in what &s;tate they will be &s;up|ported; as we know a
clergyman by his ro&s;e, or an officer by his cockade.</P>
<P>THE pretty fellows, who &s;tudy dre&s;s, might &s;hew a great
deal of invention in &s;uiting their <HI>Caprioles</HI> to their
circum|&s;tances. Any nobleman or gentleman, who has the honour to be a
<HI>Knowing one,</HI> might &s;hew his affection for the turf by carrying the
hor&s;e and jockey; another, who is an excellent driver, might bear his own
figure exalted in a <HI>Phaeton</HI>; and a third, who thinks of picking up a
partner for life, that can be plea&s;ed with a <HI>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</HI>
or &s;ober picpuet party with her hu&s;band, may bear a
<HI>vis-&agrave;-vis.</HI> In a word, all the different propo&s;als of various
&s;uitors might be made by means of the&s;e ornaments, which might be worn over
the foreheads of the beaux, like the white hor&s;e in the grenadiers caps; and
the ladies might be as much &s;mitten with a promi&s;ing <HI>Capriole</HI> on
the head of a lover, as heretofore with an elegant perriwig.</P>
<P><PB N="678" REF="253">IF this mode &s;hould prevail, the
concluding a treaty of marriage between two per&s;ons of quality might be
con&s;idered in the &s;ame light, and expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame terms as
<HI>making a match</HI> at <HI>New-market</HI>; and in&s;tead of the hackneyed
phra&s;es at pre&s;ent u&s;ed by our news-writers, we might perhaps &s;ee the
important articles in the public papers, concerning mar|riages drawn up after
the following manner.</P>
<Q> 
<P>We hear that a match will be &s;hortly made between the mourning
coach and &s;ix of a merchant's widow with a great jointure, and an hunter, in
fine order, belonging to a younger brother of a noble family.</P> 
<P>A running hor&s;e, highly valued for his blood, is expected to
&s;tart &s;oon with a young filly from York&s;hire. Many thou&s;and pounds are
depending on this match.</P> 
<P>A few days ago a young fellow from <HI>Ireland,</HI> mounted on
a &s;ingle hor&s;e, attacked an heire&s;s in her coach and &s;ix. The lady made
little or no re&s;i&s;tance, and &s;uffered her&s;elf to be taken out of the
coach, and carried off behind him.</P> 
<P>A gay coach and &s;ix, belonging to a young heir ju&s;t of age,
came to town la&s;t week in great &s;plendor, and was in|tended to be matched
with an equipage of the &s;ame kind: but having unfortunately run again&s;t
<HI>Arthur</HI>'s chocolate-hou&s;e, it broke down, and the owner was very much
hurt.</P> 
<P>We hear from <HI>Bath,</HI> that the po&s;t-chai&s;e of a young
lady of great beauty lately made its appearance in the long room, and &s;oon
after went off with the landau of a neighbouring country &s;quire.</P> 
<P>We are al&s;o informed from the &s;ame place, that an
old|fa&s;hioned two-wheel chai&s;e with a &s;ingle hor&s;e, contrived to hold
only one per&s;on, had drove about the walks for &s;ome time; but having
jo&s;tled again&s;t the Sulky of an old batchelor in his grand climacteric, it
was judged expedient to join them together; when they formed a mo&s;t agreeable
<HI>vis-a-vis,</HI> for the mutual accommodation of both parties.</P> </Q>

St. <HI>Paul's</HI> church and <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> playhou&s;e, or a
full-trimmed &s;uit and a <HI>French</HI> frock.</P>
<P>BUT the full di&s;play of modern polite learning is exhi|bited
in the decorations of parks, gardens, &amp;c. and centered in that important
mono&s;yllable, Ta&s;te. Ta&s;te comprehends the whole circle of the polite
arts, and &s;heds its influence on every lawn, avenue, gra&s;s-plat, and
parterre. Ta&s;te has peopled the walks and gardens of the great with more
nu|merous inhabitants than the ancient Satyrs, Fauns and Dry|ads. While
infidelity has expunged the Chri&s;tian Theology from our creed, Ta&s;te has
introduced the heathen Mytho|logy into our gardens. If a pond is dug,
<HI>Neptune,</HI> at the command of Ta&s;te, emerges from the ba&s;on, and
pre&s;ides in the middle; or if a vi&s;ta is cut through a grove, it mu&s;t be
terminated by a <HI>Flora</HI> or an <HI>Apollo.</HI> As the ancients held that
every &s;pot of ground had its guardian Genius, and that woodland deities were
pegged in the knotty entrails of every tree, &s;o in the gardens laid out by
modern Ta&s;te every walk is peopled with gods and godde&s;&s;es, and every
corner of it has its tutelar-deity. Temples are erected to all the train of
gods and godde&s;&s;es mentioned in <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Ovid,</HI> which
edifices as well as their &s;everal &s;tatues are adorned with <HI>Latin</HI>
or <HI>Greek</HI> in&s;criptions; while the learned owner won|ders at his own
&s;urpri&s;ing &s;tock of literature, which he &s;ees drawn out at large before
him, like the whole knowledge of an apothecary in&s;cribed upon his
gallipots.</P>
<P>THESE per&s;ons of Ta&s;te may be con&s;idered as a &s;ort of
learned idolaters, &s;ince they may be almo&s;t &s;aid to adore the&s;e graven
images, and are quite enthu&s;ia&s;tic in their veneration 
<PB N="681" REF="256"> of them. The following letter may po&s;&s;ibly give them
&s;ome offence; but as I have my&s;elf no extravagant fondne&s;s for a
<HI>Jupiter Tonans</HI> or a <HI>Belvidere Apollo,</HI> I heartily wi&s;h the
&s;cheme propo&s;ed by my corre&s;pondent may take place, though it &s;hould
reduce the price of heathen godheads.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT a time when all wi&s;e heads are con&s;idering of ways and
means to rai&s;e taxes, that may prove the lea&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive to indigence,
and mo&s;t effectually re&s;trictive of luxury, permit me to propo&s;e (as a
&s;upplement to the thoughts of one of your corre&s;pondents on this &s;ubject)
a national tax upon Gods.</P>
<P>IT is a &s;trange but an undeniable truth, Mr. TOWN, that if
you and I were to travel through <HI>England,</HI> and to vi&s;it the citizen
in his country box, the nobleman at his &s;eat, the e&s;quire at the
hall-hou&s;e, and even the divine at his par&s;onage, we &s;hould find the
gardens, avenues, and groves, belonging to each man&s;ion, &s;tuffed and
ornamented with Heathen Gods.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent declining &s;tate of our e&s;tabli&s;hed
religion, I almo&s;t tremble to con&s;ider what may be the con&s;equences of
the&s;e ready-made deities. Far be it from me to &s;uppo&s;e that the great and
the rich will wor&s;hip any God what|&s;oever, but &s;till I am induced to fear
that the poor and the vulgar, when they find all other wor&s;hip ridiculed and
laid a&s;ide, may fooli&s;hly take to the&s;e molten images, and adore every
leaden godhead they can find. If a tax on wheels has put down &s;ome hundreds
of coaches, by a parity of rea&s;on, a tax upon gods may pull down an equal, if
not a greater <PB N="682" REF="257"> number of &s;tatues. I would al&s;o offer
another propo&s;al; which is this: That an oak be immediately planted,
where-ever a &s;tatue has been taken away, by which means tho&s;e va&s;t woods,
which of late years have been cut down in <HI>England,</HI> to &s;upply the
immediate nece&s;&s;ities of the illu&s;trious <HI>Arthurites</HI> in St.
<HI>James</HI>'s-&s;treet, may be in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;upplied to future
generations.</P>
<P>AMONG our pre&s;ent taxes &s;ome of them fall upon branches of
&s;plendor not totally luxurious. Wheel carriages may be nece&s;&s;ary: want of
health or lamene&s;s of limbs may require them: but what nece&s;&s;ities can we
pretend for &s;tatues in our gardens, <HI>Penates</HI> in our libraries, and
<HI>Lares</HI> on every chimney-piece? I have remarked many wild whims of this
kind, that have appeared &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, if not attachments, to idolatry. A
gentleman of my acquaintance has de&s;troyed his chapel, merely becau&s;e he
could not put up &s;tatues in it, and has filled his garden with every god,
that can be found in <HI>Spence</HI>'s <HI>Polymetis:</HI> Another of my
friends, after having placed a <HI>Belvidere Apollo</HI> very con&s;picuou&s;ly
and na|ked upon the top of a mount, has erected an Obeli&s;k to the Sun: and
this expence he has not put him&s;elf to for the beauty of the Obeli&s;k, for
it is not beautiful, nor again for the &s;plendor of the planet, which is of
pewter double gilt, but only becau&s;e being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of copies or
originals of every deity that <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Italy</HI> could boa&s;t,
he was re&s;olved to have the God of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to compleat his
collection. A poll-tax therefore upon gods and godde&s;&s;es, be their
repre|&s;entation what it will, Suns, Dogs, Moons, or Monkies, is ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary, and would infallibly bring in a large re|venue to the
&s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="683" REF="258">HAPPENING to be the other day at
<HI>Slaughter</HI>'s coffee|hou&s;e in St. <HI>Martin's Lane,</HI> I &s;aw two
very fine &s;tatues of <HI>Fame</HI> and <HI>Fortune,</HI> brought out of Mr.
<HI>Roubilliac</HI>'s gate, and expo&s;ed to view before they were nailed up,
and carted. The boy of the hou&s;e told us, they were to be placed upon the top
of Sir <HI>Thomas &mdash;</HI>'s chapel in <HI>Hamp&s;hire.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Is it for &s;uch as the&s;e, ob&s;erved a
&s;neering papi&s;t who &s;tood near me, that crucifixes have been removed, and
that re|verend &s;aints and martyrs have been de&s;troyed, and pounded into
du&s;t? Is it for the&s;e, that St. <HI>Peter</HI> has been broken to pieces,
and St. <HI>Paul</HI> melted down into water pipes? Mu&s;t <HI>Our Lady</HI>
make room for <HI>Pro&s;erpine?</HI> And the holy giant St.
<HI>Chri&s;topher</HI> fall a victim to the <HI>Farne&s;ian Hercules?</HI> Will
you not agree with me, Sir, continued he, that as men are induced and almo&s;t
con&s;trained to judge of others by their own manners and inclinations, we who
are &s;up|po&s;ed to wor&s;hip the images of chri&s;tians, mu&s;t naturally
conclude that the prote&s;tants of the Church of <HI>England</HI> wor&s;hip the
images of heathens?"</Q> I confe&s;s I was at a lo&s;s how to an&s;wer the
acutene&s;s of his que&s;tions; and mu&s;t own that I cannot help thinking St.
<HI>Anthony</HI> preaching to the fi&s;hes, or St. <HI>Dun&s;tan</HI> taking
the Devil by the no&s;e, as pro|per ornaments for a chapel, as any Pagan
deities whatever.</P>
<P>HITHERTO I have kept you entirely among the molten images
without doors, but were we to enter the &s;everal man&s;ions who&s;e avenues
and deme&s;nes are adorned in the manner I de&s;cribe, we &s;hould find every
chamber a pagod, filled with all the mon&s;trous images that the idolatry of
<HI>India</HI> can produce. I will not pre&s;ume to infer that the ladies
addre&s;s <HI>Kitoos</HI> (prayers which the <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> make u&s;e of
in <PB N="684" REF="259"> time of public di&s;tre&s;s) to their
<HI>Ingens,</HI> but I am apt to &s;ur|mi&s;e, that in times of danger and
inva&s;ion, &s;ome of your fair readers would be more alarmed at the
<HI>French</HI> approach to their china than to their chapels, and would
&s;ooner give up a favourite lap-dog, than a grote&s;que chimney-piece figure
of a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> &s;aint with numberle&s;s heads and arms. I have not
yet dige&s;ted my thoughts in what manner the fair &s;ex ought to be taxed. It
is a tender point, and requires con&s;i|deration. At pre&s;ent, I am of
opinion, they ought to be &s;pared, and the whole burthen entirely laid upon
tho&s;e <HI>Bramins</HI> and <HI>Imams,</HI> who&s;e idolatrous temples lie
publickly open to our &s;treets.</P>

<P>_I REMEMBER when I was very young, a re|lation carried me to
vi&s;it a gentleman who had wrote &s;ome pieces that had been very well
received, and made me very happy by promi&s;ing to introduce me to an Author.
As &s;oon as I came, I &s;urveyed his whole per&s;on from top to toe with the
&s;tricte&s;t attention, &s;at open-mouthed to catch every &s;yllable that he
uttered, and noticed his voice, manner, and every word and ge&s;ture with the
minute&s;t ob&s;ervation. I could not help whi&s;pering to my&s;elf the whole
evening, 
<Q REND="inline">"I am in company with an Author,"</Q> and waited
with the mo&s;t anxious impatience to hear him deliver &s;omething that 
<PB N="686" REF="261"> might di&s;tingui&s;h him from the re&s;t of mankind.
The gentleman behaved with great chearfulne&s;s and politene&s;s; but he did
not at all an&s;wer the idea which I had conceived of an Author, and I went
away exceedingly di&s;appointed, becau&s;e I could not find any &s;triking
difference between him and the re&s;t of my acquaintance.</P>
<P>THERE is no character in human life, which is the &s;ub|ject of
more frequent &s;peculation among the vulgar, than an Author. Some look on him
with contempt, and others with admiration; but they all agree in believing him
to be &s;omething different from all other people: and it is re|markable with
what greedine&s;s they attend to any little an|ecdotes, which they can pick up
concerning his life and con|ver&s;ation. He is, indeed, a kind of an ideal
being, of which people conceive very different notions. By &s;ome he is
&s;uppo&s;ed never to &s;tir out of a garret, to wear a ru&s;ty black coat,
dirty &s;hirt, and darned &s;tockings, and to want all the nece&s;&s;aries as
well as conveniences of life; while others regard him as a creature &s;uperior
to the re&s;t of mortals, and endowed with &s;omething more than rea&s;on. One
part therefore is &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him walk abroad, and appear as well
dre&s;&s;ed as other people; and another is di&s;appointed, when they find him
talk and act, and fill the offices of life, no better than any other common
man.</P>
<P>NOR is it le&s;s curious to con&s;ider the different ideas they
conceive of the manner in which the bu&s;ine&s;s of writing is executed. The
novice in literature, &s;mit with the love of &s;acred &s;ong, but not yet dipt
in ink, &s;uppo&s;es it all rapture and enthu&s;ia&s;m, and in imagination
&s;ees the Author running wildly about his room, talking poetry to the chairs
and ta|bles; <PB N="687" REF="262"> while the mechanick con&s;iders him as
working at his trade, and thinks he can &s;et down to write whenever he
plea&s;es, as ea&s;ily as the &s;mith can labour at his forge, or a carpenter
plane a board. Indeed he regards the Author with &s;ome veneration as a
&s;cholar; but writing appears to him a mighty ea&s;y bu&s;ine&s;s, and he
&s;miles whenever he hears any body mention the labour of it; nor has he the
lea&s;t concep|tion of the mind's being fatigued with thinking, and the fancy
harra&s;&s;ed with per&s;uing a long train of ideas.</P>
<P>AS people are led frequently to judge of a man from his ordinary
conver&s;ation, &s;o it is common for them to form an idea of the author's
di&s;po&s;ition from the peculiar turn and colour of his writings: they expect
a gloom to be &s;pread over the face of a mathematician; a controver&s;ial
writer mu&s;t be given to wrangling and di&s;pute; and they imagine that a
&s;atiri&s;t mu&s;t be made up of &s;pleen, envy, and ill-nature. But this
criterion is by no means certain and determinate: I know an author of a
tragedy, who is the merrie&s;t man living; and one who has wrote a very witty
comedy, though he will &s;it an hour in company without &s;peaking a word. Lord
<HI>Buckhur&s;t</HI> is celebrated for being 
<Q REND="inline">"the be&s;t good man with the wor&s;t-natured
mu&s;e;"</Q> and Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> was remarkably &s;hy and re&s;erved in
conver&s;ation. I remember I once fell into company with a painter, a poet, a
divine, and a phy&s;ician, who were no le&s;s famous for their wit and humour,
than for their excellence in their &s;everal profe&s;&s;i|ons. After the
u&s;ual common topics were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the phy&s;ician and the poet fell
into a di&s;pute concerning pre|de&s;tination, the divine &s;moked his pipe
quietly without put|ting in a word, while the painter and my&s;elf formed a
privy <PB N="688" REF="263"> council for the good of the nation. Thus were it
po&s;&s;ible to conjure up the &s;pirits of the mo&s;t eminent wits in former
ages, and put them together, they would perhaps appear to be very dull company.
<HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> would probably &s;it &s;taring at each
other without opening their mouths; <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Steele</HI> would
perhaps join in commendation of the liquor; and <HI>Swift</HI> would in all
likelihood divert him|&s;elf with &s;ucking his cheeks, drawing figures in the
wine &s;pilt upon the table, or twirling the cork-&s;crew round his finger.</P>
<P>THE &s;trange prejudices which &s;ome per&s;ons conceive
again&s;t Authors, deter many a youth from drawing his pen in the &s;ervice of
literature: or if he ventures to commit a favourite work to the pre&s;s, he
&s;teals to the printer's with as much caution and privacy, as he would
perhaps, on ano|ther occa&s;ion, to a &s;urgeon. He is afraid that he &s;hall
in|jure his character by being known to have written any thing, and that the
genteel part of his acquaintance will de&s;pi&s;e him as a low wretch, as
&s;oon as they di&s;cover him to be an Author: as if merely the appearing in
print was a di&s;|grace to a gentleman, and the <HI>imprimatur</HI> to his
works was no more than a &s;tamp of &s;hame and ignominy. The&s;e are the
terrors, which at fir&s;t di&s;turb the peace of almo&s;t every Au|thor, and
have often put me in mind of the exclamation of that writer, who cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"O, that mine enemy had writ|ten a
book!"</Q></P>
<P>THESE fearful apprehen&s;ions are perhaps no unlucky drawback on
the vanity natural to all Authors, which un|doubtedly they often conceal or
&s;uppre&s;s, out of deference to the world: but if this fal&s;e mode&s;ty is
too much che|ri&s;hed, <PB N="689" REF="264"> it mu&s;t of cour&s;e damp all
genius, and di&s;courage every literary undertaking. Why &s;hould it be
di&s;graceful to exert the noble&s;t faculties given us by nature? and why
&s;hould any man blu&s;h at acquitting him&s;elf well in a work, which there is
&s;carce one in five hundred has a capacity to perform? Even &s;uppo&s;ing an
Author to &s;upport him&s;elf by the profit ari&s;ing from his works, there is
nothing more di&s;|hone&s;t, &s;candalous or mean in it, than an officer in the
army (the polite&s;t of all profe&s;&s;ions) living on his commi&s;&s;ion.
Sen&s;e and genius are as proper commodities to traffick in as courage, and an
Author is no more to be condemned as an hackney &s;cribbler, though he writes
at the rate of &s;o much <HI>per</HI> &s;heet, than a Colonel &s;hould be
de&s;pi&s;ed as a mercenary and a bravo, for expo&s;ing him&s;elf to be
&s;la&s;hed, &s;tuck, and &s;hot at for &s;o much <HI>per</HI> day. The truth
is, that Authors them&s;elves often create the evils they complain of, and
bring a di&s;grace on the &s;ervice of literature, by being a&s;hamed to wear
the badge of it. <HI>Voltaire,</HI> in his <HI>letters on the</HI> Engli&s;h,
relates a remarkable in&s;tance of this kind of fal&s;e pride in our own
<HI>Congreve. Voltaire,</HI> when he was in <HI>England,</HI> waited on
<HI>Congreve,</HI> and told him that he was glad of an opportunity of paying
his re&s;pects to a writer &s;o much cele|brated for his wit and humour.
<HI>Congreve</HI> received him po|litely enough, but told him that he &s;hould
be glad to &s;ee him as a common gentleman, but would not be con&s;idered or
conver&s;ed with as an Author. The <HI>French</HI> writer was a good deal
&s;urpri&s;ed at &s;uch a ridiculous piece of delicacy, and could not help
telling him, that he thought this nicety &s;ome|thing extraordinary, for that
if he had been no more than a common gentleman, he &s;hould never have had any
de&s;ire of &s;eeing him.</P>
<P>I HAVE often plea&s;ed my&s;elf with reflecting on the
differ|ent opinions, which my readers mu&s;t have formed of me, &s;ince my
fir&s;t appearance as an Author. As poverty is one of the general
characteri&s;tics of our brotherhood, tho&s;e who indulge them&s;elves in a
contempt of writers, have, I doubt <PB N="690" REF="265"> not, often painted me
to their own imagination in a very grote&s;que ta&s;te. Their ideal caricatures
have perhaps often re|pre&s;ented me lodged at lea&s;t three &s;tories from the
ground, compo&s;ing di&s;&s;ertations on the modern ta&s;te in architecture: at
another time I may have been delineated &s;itting in a tat|tered night-gown and
the breeches of a heathen philo&s;opher, writing &s;atires on the pre&s;ent
modes in dre&s;s: and &s;ometimes perhaps they have figured me half &s;tarved
for want of a hearty meal, penning invectives again&s;t luxury and
de|bauchery.</P>
<P>BUT while the&s;e have reduced me to this low condition, and 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;teeped me in poverty to the very lips,"</Q>
I flatter my|&s;elf that &s;ome few have be&s;towed on me an extraordinary
&s;hare of virtue and under&s;tanding. After &s;o many grave le&s;|&s;ons
again&s;t the vices and luxury of the pre&s;ent age, they will naturally
&s;uppo&s;e, that I never ri&s;ked a farthing at the gaming-table, never kept a
mi&s;tre&s;s, would decline an invitation to a turtle-fea&s;t, and rather than
be provoked to fight a duel, would take a kick on the breech, or tweak by the
no&s;e, with all the calmne&s;s and re&s;ignation imaginable. As to my wit and
humour, I &s;hould blu&s;h to &s;et down the many com|pliments I have had from
&s;everal unknown corre&s;pon|dents on that head: and I once received a note
from a very hone&s;t gentleman, who de&s;ired to &s;pend an evening with me,
promi&s;ing him&s;elf great diver&s;ion in cracking a bottle with the facetious
Mr. TOWN.</P>
<P>THESE various opinions of me as an Author, I &s;hall never
labour to reconcile, but &s;hall be equally contented with in|&s;tructing or
amu&s;ing the gentle reader, whether he con&s;iders my papers as favours
&s;howered down upon him from a book|&s;eller's garret in <HI>Grub Street,</HI>
or i&s;&s;uing from my own apart|ment. However this may be, I &s;hall never
think it a di&s;grace to have written, or be a&s;hamed to be con&s;idered as an
Au|thor; and if ever Mr. <HI>Voltaire</HI> &s;hould think proper to vi&s;it
<HI>England</HI> again, I &s;hall be very glad of a literary chat with him, and
will give him a very gracious reception.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_NO man is a &s;incerer friend to innocent plea|&s;antry, or
more de&s;irous of promoting it, than my&s;elf. Raillery of every kind,
pro|vided it be confined within due bounds, is in my opinion an excellent
ingredient in conver&s;ation; and I am never di&s;plea&s;ed if I can contribute
to the harmle&s;s mirth of the company, by being my&s;elf the &s;ubject of it;
but in good truth, I have neither a fortune, a con&s;titution, nor a temper
that will enable me to chuckle and &s;kake my &s;ides, while I &s;uffer more
from the fe&s;tivity of my friends, than the &s;pleen or malice of my enemies
could po&s;&s;ibly inflict upon me: nor do I &s;ee any rea&s;on why 
<PB N="692" REF="267"> I &s;hould &s;o far move the mirthful indignation of the
ladies, as to be teized and worried to death in mere &s;port, for no earthly
rea&s;on, but that I am what the world calls, an Old Bachelor.</P>
<P>THE female part of my acquaintance entertain an odd opinion,
that a Bachelor is not in fact a rational creature, at lea&s;t that he has not
the &s;en&s;e of feeling in common with the re&s;t of mankind; that a Bachelor
may be beat like a &s;tock-fi&s;h, that you may thru&s;t pins into his legs,
and wring him by the no&s;e; in &s;hort that you cannot take too many liberties
with a Bachelor. I am at a lo&s;s to conceive on what foundation the&s;e
romping philo&s;ophers have grounded their hypothe&s;is, though at the &s;ame
time I am a melancholy proof of it's exi&s;tence, as well as of it's
ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>A FRIEND of mine whom I frequently vi&s;it, has a wife and
three daughters, the younge&s;t of which has per&s;ecuted me the&s;e ten years.
The&s;e ingenious young ladies have not only found out the &s;ole end and
purpo&s;e of my being them|&s;elves, but have likewi&s;e communicated their
di&s;covery to all the girls in the neighbourhood. So that if they happen at
any time to be apprized of my coming (which I take all po&s;&s;ible care to
prevent) they immediately di&s;patch half a dozen cards to their faithful
allies, to beg the favour of their company to drink coffee, and <HI>help
teaze</HI> Mr. <HI>Iron&s;ide.</HI> Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, my entry into the
room is &s;ometimes ob&s;tructed by a cord fa&s;tened acro&s;s the bottom of
the door|ca&s;e, which as I am a little near-&s;ighted, I &s;eldom di&s;cover
till it has brought me upon my knees before them. While I am employed in
bru&s;hing the du&s;t from my black rollers, or cha&s;ing my broken &s;hins, my
wig is &s;uddenly conveyed <PB N="693" REF="268"> away, and either &s;tuffed
behind the looking-gla&s;s, or to&s;&s;ed from one to the other &s;o
dextrou&s;ly and with &s;uch velocity, that after many a fruitle&s;s attempt to
recover it, I am obliged to &s;it down bare-headed, to the great diver&s;ion of
the &s;pec|tators. The la&s;t time I found my&s;elf in the&s;e di&s;tre&s;sful
circum&s;tances, the elde&s;t girl, a &s;prightly mi&s;chievous jade, &s;tepped
bri&s;kly up to me, and promi&s;ed to re&s;tore my wig, if I would play her a
tune on a &s;mall flute &s;he held in her hand. I in&s;tantly applied it to my
lips, and blowing lu&s;tily into it, to my inconceiveable &s;urpri&s;e, was
immediately choked and blinded with a cloud of &s;oot that i&s;&s;ued from
every hole in the in&s;trument. The younger part of the company declared I had
not executed the conditions, and refu&s;ed to &s;urrender my wig; but the
father who had a rough kind of facetiou&s;ne&s;s about him, in&s;i&s;ted on
it's being delivered up, and prote&s;ted that he never knew the <HI>Black
Joke</HI> better performed in his life.</P>
<P>I AM naturally a quiet inoffen&s;ive animal, and not ea&s;ily
ruf|fled, yet I &s;hall never &s;ubmit to the&s;e indignities with patience,
'till I am &s;atisfied I de&s;erve them. Even the old maids of my acquaintance,
who one would think might have a fellow-feeling for a brother in di&s;tre&s;s,
con&s;pire with their nieces to harra&s;s and torment me. And it is not many
nights &s;ince Mi&s;s <HI>Diana Grizzle</HI> utterly &s;poiled the only
&s;uperfine &s;uit I have in the world, by pinning the &s;kirts of it together
with a red-hot poker. I own my re&s;entment of this injury was &s;o &s;trong,
that I determined to puni&s;h it by ki&s;&s;ing the offender, which in cool
blood I &s;hould never have attempted. The &s;atisfac|tion however which I
obtained by this imprudent revenge, was much like what a man of honour feels on
finding him|&s;elf <PB N="694" REF="269"> run through the body by the
&s;coundrel who had offended him. My upper lip was transfixed with a large
corkin pin, which in the &s;cuffle &s;he had conveyed into her mouth, and I
doubt not that I &s;hall carry the <HI>memorem labris natam</HI> from an old
maid to the grave with me.</P>
<P>THESE misfortunes, or others of the &s;ame kind, I en|counter
daily; but at the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons of the year which give a &s;anction to this
kind of practical wit, and when every man thinks he has a right to entertain
him&s;elf at his friend's ex|pence, I live in hourly apprehen&s;ions of more
mortifying adventures. No mi&s;erable dunghill-cock, devoted a victim to the
wanton cruelty of the mob, would be more terrified at the approach of a
<HI>Shrove-Tue&s;day,</HI> were he endued with human rea&s;on and foreca&s;t,
than I am at the approach of a merry <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> or the Fir&s;t of
<HI>April.</HI> No longer ago than la&s;t <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> which was the
latter of the&s;e fe&s;tivals, I was pe&s;tered with mortifying pre&s;ents from
the ladies; obliged to pay the carriage of half a dozen oy&s;ter-barrels
&s;tuffed with brick-bats, and ten pacquets by the po&s;t containing nothing
but old news-papers. But what vexed me the mo&s;t was the being &s;ent fifty
miles out of town on that day by a counter|feit expre&s;s from a dying
relation.</P>
<P>I COULD not help reflecting with a &s;igh, on the
re&s;em|blance between the imaginary grievance of poor <HI>Tom</HI> in the
tragedy of <HI>Lear,</HI> and tho&s;e which I really experienced. I, like him,
was led through ford and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire; and though knives
were not laid under my pil|low, minced hor&s;e-hair was &s;trewed upon my
&s;heets; like him I was made to ride on a hard trotting hor&s;e, through the
mo&s;t dangerous ways, and found at the end of my jour|ney, that I had only
been cour&s;ing my own &s;hadow.</P>
<P><PB N="695" REF="270">AS much a &s;ufferer as I am by the
behaviour of the women in general, I mu&s;t not forget to remark, that the
pertne&s;s and &s;aucine&s;s of an old maid, is particularly offen|&s;ive to
me. I cannot help thinking that the virginity of the&s;e ancient mi&s;&s;es, is
at lea&s;t as ridiculous as my own celibacy. If I am to be condemned for having
never made an offer, they are as much to blame for having never accepted one.
If I am to be derided for having never married, who never attempted to make a
conque&s;t; they are more properly the objects of deri&s;ion, who are &s;till
unmarried after having made &s;o many. Numberle&s;s are the propo&s;als they
have rejected according to their own account; and they are eter|nally
boa&s;ting of the havock they have formerly made among the knights, baronets,
and &s;quires, at <HI>Bath, Tun|bridge</HI> and <HI>Ep&s;om</HI>; while a
tattered madrigal perhaps, a &s;nip of hair, or the portrait of a
cherry-cheeked gentleman in a milk-white periwig, are the only remaining proofs
of tho&s;e beauties which are now withered like the &s;hort-lived ro&s;e, and
have only left the virgin thorn remaining.</P>
<P>BELIEVE me, Mr. TOWN, I am almo&s;t afraid to tru&s;t you with
the publication of this epi&s;tle; the ladies whom I la&s;t mentioned will be
&s;o exa&s;perated on reading it, that I mu&s;t expect no quarter at their
hands for the future, &s;ince they are generally as little inclined to
forgivene&s;s in their old age, as they were to pity and compa&s;&s;ion in
their youth. One expedient however is left me, and which, if put in execution,
will effectually &s;creen me from their re&s;entment.</P>
<P>I SHALL be happy therefore, if by your means I may be
permitted to inform the ladies, that as fu&s;ty an animal as they think me, it
is not impo&s;&s;ible but by a little gentler <PB N="696" REF="271"> treatment
than I have hitherto met with, I may be huma|nized into a hu&s;band. As an
inducement to them to relieve me from my pre&s;ent unea&s;y circum&s;tances,
you may a&s;&s;ure them I am rendered &s;o exceeding tractable by the very
&s;e|vere di&s;cipline I have undergone, that they may mould and fa&s;hion me
to their minds with ea&s;e; and con&s;equently that by marrying me, a woman
will &s;ave her&s;elf all that trouble which a wife of any &s;pirit is obliged
to take with an unruly hu&s;band, who is ab&s;urd enough to expect from her a
&s;trict performance of the marriage vow, even in the very minute article of
obedience: that &s;o far from contradicting a lady, I &s;hall be mighty well
&s;atisfied if &s;he contents her&s;elf with contradicting me: that if I happen
at any time inadvertently to thwart her inclinations, I &s;hall think my&s;elf
rightly &s;erved if &s;he boxes my ears, &s;pits in my face, or treads upon my
corns. That if I approach her lips when &s;he is not in a ki&s;&s;ing humour, I
&s;hall expect &s;he will bite me by the no&s;e; or if I take her by the hand
at an improper &s;ea&s;on, that &s;he will in&s;tantly begin to pinch,
&s;cratch, and claw, and apply her fingers to tho&s;e purpo&s;es which they
were certainly in|tended by nature to fulfil. Add to the&s;e accompli&s;hments,
&s;o requi&s;ite to make the married &s;tate happy, that I am not much turned
of fifty, can tie on my cravat, fa&s;ten a button, or mend a hole in my
&s;tocking without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P>_THOSE parents, who are unable to give their &s;ons an e&s;tate,
regard the educating them to one of the three great profe&s;&s;ions of Law,
Phy&s;ic, and Divinity, as putting them in the high road to acquire one. Hence
it happens, that nineteen parts out of twenty of our young men are brought up
with a view to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> the <HI>Seals,</HI> or <HI>Warwick-Lane.</HI>
But alas! their hopes and ex|pectations of ri&s;ing by their profe&s;&s;ions
are often fru&s;trated, and the &s;urprizing numbers engaged in running the
&s;ame race nece&s;&s;arily jo&s;tle one another. For though the courts of
ju&s;tice are tolerably &s;upplied with matters of litigation; 
<PB N="698" REF="273"> though there are many invalids and valetudinarians; and
though great part of <HI>England</HI> is laid out into church pre|ferments; yet
there is not in all the kingdom &s;ufficient matter for legal contention to
employ a tenth part of tho&s;e who have been trained to engro&s;s deeds in
their chambers, or to harangue at the bar: the number of patients bears no
proportion to the &s;warms of the Faculty, nor would it, though a
con&s;ultation were to &s;it on every &s;ick man, like carrion-flies upon a
carca&s;e: and the prodigious number of reverend Divines infinitely exceeds
that of tho&s;e bi&s;hopricks, deaneries, prebends, rectories, vicarages,
&amp;c. which, when they are ordained, they conceive it to be part of their
holy office to fill. From the&s;e frequent failures in each of the
profe&s;&s;ions, the younger &s;ons of great men often wi&s;h they had been
permitted to di&s;grace the family by &s;ome mer|cantile, or more plebeian
occupation; while the &s;on of the mechanic cur&s;es the pride of his father,
who in&s;tead of &s;ecuring him a livelihood in his own bu&s;ine&s;s, has
con|demned him to &s;tarve in pudding-&s;leeves, that he might do honour to his
relations by being a gentleman.</P>
<P>THE Three Profe&s;&s;ions being thus crouded with more
candidates for bu&s;ine&s;s and preferment, than can po&s;&s;ibly be employed
or promoted, has occa&s;ioned &s;everal irregula|rities in the conduct of the
followers of each of them. The utter impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;upporting
them&s;elves in the u&s;ual method of practi&s;ing Law, Phy&s;ic, or Divinity,
without clients, patients, or pari&s;hioners, has induced the labourers in each
of tho&s;e vocations to &s;eek out new veins and branches. The young Solicitor,
who finds he has nothing to do, now he is out of his clerk&s;hip, offers his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in the tran&s;action of all law affairs, by the public
papers, and <PB N="699" REF="274"> like the adverti&s;ing taylors promi&s;es to
work cheaper than any of his brethren: while the young Barri&s;ter, after
having exhibited his tye-wig in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> during &s;everal
terms, to no purpo&s;e, is obliged to forego the hope of ri|valling
<HI>Murray</HI> and <HI>Coke,</HI> and content him&s;elf with being the oracle
of the courts of <HI>Jamaica.</HI> The graduate in me|dicine, finding him&s;elf
un&s;olicited for pre&s;cription or advice, and likely to &s;tarve by
practi&s;ing Phy&s;ic <HI>&s;ecund&ugrave;m artem,</HI> flies in the face of
the college, and profe&s;&s;es to cure all di&s;|ea&s;es by <HI>no&s;trums</HI>
unmentioned in the di&s;pen&s;atory. He com|mences a thriving quack, and &s;oon
makes his way through the important medical degrees of walking on foot, riding
on hor&s;eback, di&s;pen&s;ing his drugs from an one-hor&s;e-chai&s;e, and
la&s;tly lolling in a chariot. The Divine, without living, cure, or
lecture&s;hip, may perhaps incur tran&s;portation for illegal marriages, &s;et
up a theatrical-oratorical-<HI>Billing&s;gate</HI>-chapel under the &s;helter
of the toleration-act and the but|chers of <HI>Clare-Market,</HI> or kindle the
<HI>inward light</HI> in the bo&s;oms of the Saints of <HI>Moor-Fields,</HI>
and the <HI>Magdalens</HI> of <HI>Broad</HI> St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding the&s;e &s;hoots ingrafted, as it were,
into the main body of the profe&s;&s;ions, it is &s;till impo&s;&s;ible for the
va&s;t multitude of Divines, Lawyers, and Phy&s;icians to maintain them&s;elves
at any rate within the pale of their re&s;pective employments. They have often
been compelled, at lea&s;t to call in adventitious ones, and have &s;ometimes
to|tally abandoned their original undertakings. They have frequently made
mutual tran&s;itions into the occupations of each other, or have perhaps
embraced other employments; which, though di&s;tinct from all three, and not
u&s;ually dig|nified with the title of Profe&s;&s;ions, may fairly be
con&s;idered <PB N="700" REF="275"> in that light: &s;ince they are the &s;ole
means of &s;upport to many thou&s;ands, who toiled in vain for a
&s;ub&s;i&s;tance in the three Capital Ones. On the&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions, and
their various followers, I &s;hall here make &s;ome ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions is an Author. The mart of
literature is indeed one of the chief re&s;orts of unbeneficed Divines, and
Lawyers and Phy&s;icians without practice. There are at pre&s;ent in the world
of Authors, Doctors of Phy&s;ic who (to u&s;e the phra&s;e of one of them) have
no great fatigue from the bu&s;ine&s;s of their profe&s;&s;ion: many Clergymen,
who&s;e &s;ermons are the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable part of their compo&s;itions:
and &s;everal Gentlemen of the Inns of Court who, in&s;tead of driving the
quill over &s;kins of parch|ment, lead it through all the mazes of modern
novels, cri|tiques, and pamphlets. Many al&s;o have embraced this
Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, who were never bred to any other: and I might al&s;o mention
the many bankrupt trade&s;men and broken artificers, who daily enter into this
new way of bu&s;ine&s;s, if by per&s;uing it in the &s;ame mechanical manner as
their former occupati|ons, they might not rather be regarded as following a
trade than a Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd of the&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions is a Player. The
inge|nious gentlemen, who a&s;&s;ume the per&s;ons of the Drama, are compo&s;ed
of as great a variety of characters as tho&s;e they repre&s;ent. The hi&s;tory
of the &s;tage might afford many in|&s;tances of tho&s;e who <HI>in the trade
of</HI> death <HI>might have &s;lain men,</HI> who have conde&s;cended to deal
counterfeit &s;laughter from their right hands, and admini&s;ter harmle&s;s
phials and bowls of poi&s;on. We might read al&s;o of per&s;ons who&s;e fi&s;ts
were intended to beat the 
<Q REND="inline">"drum eccle&s;ia&s;tic,"</Q> who have 
<PB N="701" REF="276"> them&s;elves become theatrical voluntiers. In regard to
the Law, many who were originally de&s;igned to manife&s;t their talents for
elocution in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> have di&s;played them in
<HI>Drury-Lane</HI>; and it may be added on theatrical authority, that 
<Q> 
<L>Not even <HI>Attorneys</HI> have this rage with&s;tood,</L> 
<L>But chang'd their pens for truncheons, ink for blood,</L> 
<L>And, &s;trange rever&s;e!&mdash;died for their country's
good.</L></Q> I will not &s;o far affront tho&s;e gentlemen, who were at any
time engaged in the &s;tudy of the three honourable profe&s;|&s;ions of Law,
Phy&s;ic, and Divinity, as to &s;uppo&s;e that any of them, have ever taken up
the more fa&s;hionable employment of a Pimp. Yet it is certain, that this is a
very common and lucrative Profe&s;&s;ion, and that very many provide
them&s;elves with the nece&s;&s;aries of life, by admini&s;tering to the
plea&s;ures of others. A convenient cou&s;in, &s;i&s;ter, or wife, has
&s;ome|times proved the chief means of making a fortune; and the tongue of
&s;lander has often ventured to affirm, that the price of procuration has been
paid with a place or a bi&s;hoprick.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t advantageous and genteel of all Profe&s;&s;ions is
Gaming. Whoever will make this &s;cience his &s;tudy will find it the
readie&s;t way to riches, and mo&s;t certain pa&s;&s;port to the be&s;t
company: for the polite world will always admit any one to their &s;ociety, who
will conde&s;cend to win their money. The followers of this Profe&s;&s;ion are
very nume|rous; which is indeed no wonder, when we reflect on the numbers it
&s;upports in ea&s;e and affluence, at no greater pains than packing the cards
or cogging the dice, and no more ri&s;k than being &s;ometimes tweaked by the
no&s;e, or kicked out of company: be&s;ides which, this Profe&s;&s;ion daily
re|ceives <PB N="702" REF="277"> new lu&s;tre from the many per&s;ons of
quality that follow it, and croud into it with as much eagerne&s;s, as into the
army. Among Game&s;ters may al&s;o be found Lawyers, who get more by being
ma&s;ters of all the Ca&s;es in <HI>Hoyle,</HI> than by their knowledge of
tho&s;e, recorded in the report|books; Phy&s;icians, the chief object of
who&s;e attention is the circulation of the E. O. table; and Divines, who, we
may &s;uppo&s;e, were hinted at by a famous wit in a certain a&s;&s;embly, when
among the other benefits re&s;ulting from a double tax upon dice, he thought
fit to enumerate, that it might po&s;&s;ibly prevent the Clergy from playing at
back-gammon.</P>
<P>BUT the more danger the more honour: and therefore no
Profe&s;&s;ion is more honourable than that of a Highwayman. Who the followers
of this Profe&s;&s;ion are, and with what &s;uc|ce&s;s they practi&s;e it, I
will not pretend to relate; as the memoirs of &s;everal of them have been
already penned by the Ordinary of <HI>Newgate,</HI> and as it is to be hoped
that the lives of all the pre&s;ent practitioners will be written here|after by
that faithful hi&s;torian. I &s;hall therefore only &s;ay, that the pre&s;ent
&s;pirit of di&s;&s;olutene&s;s and freethinking mu&s;t unavoidably bring this
honourable Profe&s;&s;ion more and more into vogue, and that every Se&s;&s;ions
may &s;oon be expected to afford an in&s;tance of a
<HI>Gentleman</HI>-Highwayman.</P>

<P>_I Have often amu&s;ed my&s;elf with con&s;i|dering the mean and
ridiculous &s;hifts, to which the extravagant are &s;ometimes re|duced. When
the certain &s;upplies of a regular income are exhau&s;ted, they are obliged to
ca&s;t about for ready ca&s;h, and &s;et the invention to work in order to
devi&s;e the means of repairing their finances. Such attempts to enlarge their
revenue have frequently driven tho&s;e, who&s;e great &s;ouls would not be
curbed by the &s;traitne&s;s of their circum&s;tances, into very uncommon
undertakings: they have &s;ent lords to <HI>Arthur</HI>'s, and ladies to
a&s;&s;emblies, or &s;ometimes wor&s;e places. We may &s;afely conclude, that
whoever breaks through all oeconomy, will &s;oon di&s;card hone&s;ty; though
perhaps it might be deemed <HI>Scandalum Magnatum</HI> to aver, that prodigal
men of quality have often &s;old their <PB N="704" REF="279"> country to redeem
their e&s;tates, and that extravagant ladies have been known to make up the
deficiencies of their pin-money by pilfering and larceny.</P>
<P>But one of the fir&s;t and chief re&s;ources of extravagance,
both in high and low life, is the Pawnbroker's. I never pa&s;s by one of
the&s;e &s;hops without con&s;idering them as the repo&s;itories of half the
jewels, plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in town. It is true, indeed, that the hone&s;t
and indu&s;trious are &s;ometimes forced to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ities by
this method: but if we were to enquire, to whom the &s;everal articles in
the&s;e mi&s;cellaneous warehou&s;es belong, we &s;hould find the greate&s;t
part of them to be the pro|perty of the idle and infamous among the vulgar, or
the prodigal and luxurious among the great: and if, in imi|tation of the
antients, who placed the Temple of Honour behind the Temple of Virtue,
propriety &s;hould be at|tempted in the &s;ituation of Pawnbrokers' &s;hops,
they would be placed contiguous to a gin-&s;hop, as in the in|genious print of
<HI>Hogarth,</HI> or behind a tavern, gaming-hou&s;e, or bagnio.</P>
<P>Going home late la&s;t Saturday night, I was witne&s;s to a
curious dialogue at the door of one of the&s;e hou&s;es. An hone&s;t journeyman
carpenter, who&s;e wife, it &s;eems, had pawned his be&s;t cloaths, having
ju&s;t received his week's pay, was come to redeem them, that he might appear
as fine as he u&s;ually did on Sunday: but it being pa&s;t twelve o'clock, the
man of the hou&s;e, who kept up the conver&s;ation by means of a little grate
in the door, re|fu&s;ed to deliver them; though the poor carpenter begged hard
for his holiday cloaths, as the morrow was <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Sunday. This
accident led me to reflect on the various per&s;ons in town, who carry on this
kind of commerce with the Pawnbrokers, and gave occa&s;ion to the fol|lowing
Dream.</P>
<P>I was &s;carce a&s;leep, before I found my&s;elf at the entrance
of a blind alley, which was terminated by a little hatch; where I &s;aw a
va&s;t concour&s;e of people, of different ages, &s;ex, and condition, going in
and coming out. Some of the&s;e, I ob&s;erved, as they went up, very 
<PB N="705" REF="280"> richly dre&s;t; and others were adorned with jewels and
co&s;tly trinkets: but I could not help remarking, that at their return they
were all dive&s;ted of their finery; and &s;everal had even their gowns and
coats &s;tript off their backs. A lady, who &s;trutted up in a rich brocaded
&s;uit, &s;neaked back again in an ordinary &s;tuff night-gown; a &s;econd
retreated with the lo&s;s of a diamond &s;olitaire and pearl necklace; and a
third, who had bundled up her whole &s;tock of linen, &s;carce e&s;caped with
what &s;he had upon her back. I ob&s;erved &s;everal gentlemen, who brought
their &s;ideboards of plate, to be melted down, as it were, into current
&s;pecie: many had their pockets di&s;|burthened of their watches; and &s;ome,
even among the military gentlemen, were obliged to deliver up their &s;words.
Others of the company marched up, heavy laden with pictures, hou&s;ehold goods,
and dome&s;tic uten&s;ils: one carried a &s;pit; another brandi&s;hed a
gridiron; a third flouri&s;hed a frying-pan; while a fourth brought to my
remembrance the old &s;ign of the Dog's Head in the Porridge-pot. I &s;aw
&s;everal trot up merrily with their chairs, tables, and other furniture: but I
could not help pitying one poor creature among the re&s;t, who, after having
&s;tript his whole hou&s;e, even to his feather-bed, &s;talked along like a
Lock-Patient, wrapt up in the blankets, while his wife accompanied him, doing
pe|nance in the &s;heets.</P>
<P>As I was naturally curious to &s;ee the in&s;ide of the
re|ceptacle, where all the&s;e various &s;poils were depo&s;ited, I &s;tept up
to the hatch; and meeting a grave old gentleman at the thre&s;hold, I de&s;ired
him to inform me what place it was, and what bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted
there. He very courteou&s;ly took me by the hand, and, leading me through a
dark pa&s;&s;age, brought me into a &s;pacious hall, which he told me was the
Temple of U&s;ury, and that he him&s;elf was the chief prie&s;t of it. One part
of this building was hung round with all kinds of apparel, like the
&s;ale-&s;hops in <HI>Monmouth Street</HI>; another was &s;trew'd with a
variety of goods, and re&s;embled the brokers' &s;hops in <HI>Harp Alley</HI>;
and another part was furni&s;hed with &s;uch an immen&s;e quantity of jewels
and rich plate, that I &s;hould rather have fancied my&s;elf in the Church of
the <PB N="706" REF="281"> Lady of <HI>Loretto.</HI> All the&s;e, my guide
informed me, were the offerings of that croud, which I had &s;een re|&s;orting
to this Temple. The Churches in Roman-Catholic countries have commonly a
cro&s;s fixed upon them; the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> erect dragons and hang bells
about their Pagods; and the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Mo&s;ques have their peculiar
hieroglyphics: but I could not help taking particular notice, that this Temple
of U&s;ury had its ve&s;tibule adorned with three wooden balls painted blue;
the my&s;tery of which, I was told, was as dark and unfathomable as the
<HI>Pythagorean</HI> number, or the &s;ecret doctrines of
<HI>Tri&s;megi&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>When I had in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;atisfied my curio&s;ity in
taking a general &s;urvey of the Temple, my in&s;tructor led me to an interior
corner of it, where the mo&s;t &s;plendid offerings were &s;pread upon a large
altar. This bauble, &s;aid he, &s;hewing me an elegant &s;prig of diamonds, is
an aigret, &s;ent in la&s;t week by a lady of quality, who has ever &s;ince
kept home with her head muffled up in a double clout for a pretended fit of the
tooth-ache. She has at different times made an offering of all her jewels: and
be&s;ides the&s;e, her whole wardrobe was very lately lodged here, which threw
her into an hy&s;teric fever, and con|fined her to her bed-gown for upwards of
a month. Tho&s;e ear-rings and other jewels are the <HI>parapher|nalia</HI> of
a young bride; who was &s;o con&s;tant a votary to this place, that, when
nothing el&s;e remained for an offering, &s;he even brought in her
wedding-ring. You may be &s;urpri&s;ed, perhaps, to behold &s;uch a variety of
necklaces, girdle-buckles, &s;olitaires, and other female ornaments, as are
here collected: but it is ob&s;ervable, that their devotions in the Temple of
U&s;ury have been chiefly encouraged and kept alive by their a&s;&s;i&s;ting at
the midnight orgies of Avarice.</P>
<P>Nor are the gentlemen, continued he, le&s;s encouragers of our
rites. That gold watch laid &s;nug, for a con&s;i|derable time, in the fob of a
young man of quality; but it was one night jerked out by a &s;ingle throw of
the dice at a gaming-table, and made its way into the pocket of a &s;tranger,
who placed it here, to keep company with &s;everal others, which have been
brought hither on a <PB N="707" REF="282"> &s;imilar occa&s;ion. Tho&s;e
brilliant buckles once glittered on the &s;hoes of a very pretty fellow, who
&s;et out la&s;t winter on his travels into foreign parts, but never got
further than <HI>Boulogne:</HI> and that &s;word with the rich fillagree hilt,
and elegantly-fancied &s;word-knot with gold ta&s;&s;els, once dangled at the
&s;ide of a &s;pirited Buck, who left it here two years ago, when he went off
in a great hurry to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large e&s;tate in his native
country, <HI>Ireland,</HI> whence he is not yet returned. You may &s;ee many
others of the&s;e in&s;truments of death, which ru&s;t peacefully in their
&s;cabbards, as being of no u&s;e whatever to their owners: that, which
commonly hangs upon the vacant peg there, belongs, you mu&s;t know, to a noble
captain: it is called upon duty once a month, and is at this in&s;tant mounting
guard at St. <HI>James</HI>'s.</P>
<P>Not far from the&s;e rich ornaments hung &s;everal em|broidered
coats, laced wai&s;tcoats, <HI>Point d'E&s;pagne</HI> hats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
This &s;uit, &s;aid my venerable in&s;tructor, pointing to one richly
embroidered, was made up for a noble lord on the la&s;t Birth-day, and was
conveyed hither the very next morning after it had appeared at court. That
jemmy wai&s;tcoat with the gold-worked button-holes, on the next peg, was the
property of a &s;mart templar, who, having &s;pent a night out of his chambers,
&s;ent his wai&s;t|coat hither in the morning, as a penitential offering, by
his landlady. As to that heap of camblet gowns, checked aprons, and coloured
handkerchiefs, which you &s;ee &s;trung together a little further off, they are
oblations made here by a &s;ect of maudlin votaries, who re&s;ort to this
Temple to pay their devotions to a Godde&s;s, whom they have chri&s;tened Madam
<HI>Gin,</HI> but whom they &s;ometimes honour with the more proper appellation
of <HI>Strip me Naked.</HI></P>
<P>While my conductor was thus relating the hi&s;tory of the
various offerings, and the per&s;ons who had made them, he was &s;uddenly
called a&s;ide to a dark clo&s;et, &s;e|veral of which were erected near the
entrance, and ap|peared not unlike the confe&s;&s;ionals of the
<HI>Romi&s;h</HI> prie&s;ts. The&s;e little boxes, I found, were appointed to
receive the votaries, who came to pay their devotions, and make their
offerings: but the nece&s;&s;ary rites and ceremonies <PB N="708" REF="283">
were commonly &s;olemnized with as much caution and privacy, as the my&s;teries
of the <HI>Bona Dea</HI> among the <HI>Romans.</HI> At pre&s;ent, however,
there was a greater noi&s;e and hubbub than u&s;ual. A per&s;on of the fir&s;t
rank in the kingdom, who had made &s;ome very con&s;iderable oblations of gold
and &s;ilver plate, was now about to celebrate a fea&s;t in honour of
<HI>Bacchus,</HI> in which the&s;e rich uten&s;ils would be requi&s;ite, on
which occa&s;ion he prayed to have the u&s;e of them. The chief prie&s;t, after
having received the cu&s;tomary fee, granted a di&s;pen|&s;ation for this
purpo&s;e, and loaded the me&s;&s;engers with a number of wrought ewers,
va&s;es, and chargers, at the &s;ame time commi&s;&s;ioning two or three of the
inferior officials of the Temple to attend the celebration of the fea&s;t, and
to take care that the plate was duly returned, and &s;afely lodged again in the
Temple.</P>
<P>The&s;e matters were &s;carce adju&s;ted, before an unex|pected
incident filled the whole Temple with confu&s;ion and di&s;turbance. A rude
tribe of officers broke in upon us, put a &s;top to the rites, and &s;eized the
chief prie&s;t him&s;elf, charging him with having prophaned the place by a
crime almo&s;t as infamous as &s;acrilege. He was accu&s;ed of having
encouraged robbers to &s;trip the citizens of their mo&s;t valuable effects,
and for a &s;mall reward to depo&s;it them as offerings. The clamour on this
occa&s;ion was very great, and at la&s;t one of the officers, methought,
&s;eized me, as a party concerned; when endeavouring to clear my&s;elf, and
&s;truggling to get out of his clutches, I awoke.</P>

<P>_THERE is no race of people, that has been more con&s;picuous in
almo&s;t every relation of life, than the illu&s;trious fa|mily of NONSENSE. In
every age of the world they have &s;hone forth with uncommon lu&s;tre, and have
made a wonderful progre&s;s in all the Arts and Sciences. They have at
different &s;ea&s;ons delivered &s;peeches from the throne, harangued at the
bar, debated in parlia|ment, and gone amazing lengths in philo&s;ophical
enqui|ries and metaphy&s;ical di&s;qui&s;itions. In a word, the whole hi&s;tory
of the world, moral and political, is but a <HI>Cyclo|paedia of</HI> NONSENSE.
For which rea&s;on, con&s;idering the dignity and importance of the family, and
the infinite &s;ervice it has been of to me and many of my cotemporaries, 
<PB N="710" REF="285"> I have re&s;olved to oblige the public with a kind of
ab&s;tract of the Hi&s;tory of NONSENSE.</P>
<P>NONSENSE was the daughter of IGNORANCE, begot on FALSEHOOD many
ages ago in a dark cavern in BOEOTIA. As &s;he grew up, &s;he inherited all the
qualities of her parents: &s;he di&s;covered too warm a genius to re|quire
being &s;ent to &s;chool; but while other dull brats were poring over an
horn-book, &s;he amu&s;ed her&s;elf with &s;preading fanta&s;tical lies, taught
her by her mamma, and which have in later ages been familiarly known to us
under the names of <HI>Sham, Banter,</HI> and <HI>Humbug.</HI> When &s;he grew
up, &s;he received the addre&s;&s;es, and &s;oon became the wife, of IMPUDENCE.
Who he was, or of what profe&s;&s;ion, is uncertain: Some &s;ay he was the
&s;on of IGNORANCE by another <HI>venter,</HI> and was &s;uffered to become the
hu&s;band of NONSENSE in tho&s;e dark ages of the world, as the
<HI>Ptolemies</HI> of <HI>Aegypt</HI> married their own &s;i&s;ters. Some
record, that he was in the army; others, that he was an interpreter of the
laws; and others, a divine. However this was, NONSENSE and IM|PUDENCE were
&s;oon in&s;eparably united to each other, and became the founders of a more
noble and nume|rous family, than any yet pre&s;erved on any tree of de&s;cent
what&s;oever; of which ingenious device they were &s;aid to have been the
fir&s;t inventors.</P>
<P>It is my chief intent at pre&s;ent to record the great exploits
of that branch of the family, who have made them&s;elves remarkable in
<HI>England</HI>; though they began to &s;ignalize them&s;elves very early, and
are &s;till very flouri&s;hing in mo&s;t parts of the world. Many of them were
<HI>Aegyptian</HI> Prie&s;ts four thou&s;and years ago, and told the people,
that it was religion to wor|&s;hip dogs, monkeys, and green leeks: and their
de&s;cen|dants prevailed on the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> to build
tem|ples in honour of &s;uppo&s;ed deities, who were, in their 
<PB N="711" REF="286"> own e&s;timation of them, whores and whore-mongers,
pickpockets and drunkards. Others ro&s;e up &s;ome ages after in
<HI>Turky,</HI> and per&s;uaded the people to embrace the doctrine of
blood&s;hed and the &s;word, <HI>in the name of the mo&s;t merciful God:</HI>
and others have manife&s;ted their lineal de&s;cent from NONSENSE and
IMPU|DENCE, by affirming that there is no God at all. There were al&s;o among
them many &s;hrewd philo&s;ophers; &s;ome of whom, though they were racked with
a fit of the &s;tone, or laid up with a gouty toe, declared that they felt not
the lea&s;t degree of pain; and others would not tru&s;t their own eyes, but
when they &s;aw an hor&s;e or a dog, could not tell whether it was not a chair
or a table, and even made a doubt of their own exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>We have no certain account of the progre&s;s of NON|SENSE here
in <HI>England,</HI> till after the Reformation. All we hear of her and her
progeny before that period of time is, that they led a lazy life among the
monks in cloy&s;ters and convents, dreaming over old legends of &s;aints,
drawing up breviaries and ma&s;s-books, and &s;tring|ing together &s;ome
barbarous <HI>Latin</HI> ver&s;es in rhyme. In the days of Queen
<HI>Elizabeth,</HI> &s;o little encouragement was given to her family, that it
&s;eemed to have been almo&s;t extinct: but in the &s;ucceeding reign it
flouri&s;hed again, and filled the mo&s;t con&s;iderable offices in the nation.
NONSENSE became a great favourite at court, where &s;he was highly care&s;&s;ed
on account of her wit, which con&s;i&s;ted in puns and quibbles; and the bonny
monarch him&s;elf was thought to take a more than or|dinary delight in her
conver&s;ation. At this time, many of her progeny took orders, and got
them&s;elves preferred to the be&s;t livings, by turning the Evangeli&s;ts into
pun|&s;ters, and making St. <HI>Paul</HI> quibble from the pulpit. Among the
re&s;t, there was a bi&s;hop, a favourite &s;on of NONSENSE, of whom it is
particularly recorded, that he u&s;ed to tickle his courtly audience, by
telling them that <PB N="712" REF="287"> <HI>matrimony</HI> was become a
<HI>matter of money,</HI> with many other right reverend je&s;ts recorded in
<HI>Joe Miller.</HI> Several bro|thers of this family were likewi&s;e bred to
the bar, and very gravely harangued again&s;t old women &s;ucked by devils in
the &s;hape of ram-cats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As an in&s;tance of their profound
wi&s;dom and &s;agacity, I need only men|tion that ju&s;t and truly pious act
of parliament made again&s;t the crying &s;in of witchcraft. 
<Q REND="inline"><BIBL>1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. chap. 12.</BIBL>
<HI>Such as &s;hall u&s;e invocation or conjuration of any evil &s;pirit, or
&s;hall con&s;ult, covenant with, entertain, employ, feed or reward any evil
&s;pirit to any intent, or take up any dead per&s;on, or part thereof, to be
u&s;ed in witchcraft, or have u&s;ed any of the &s;aid arts, whereby any
per&s;on &s;hall be killed, con&s;umed, or lamed in his or her body, they,
together with their ac|ce&s;&s;ories before the fact, &s;hall &s;uffer as
felons, without benefit of clergy.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In the trouble&s;ome times of King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t,
NONSENSE and her family &s;ided with the Parliament. The&s;e &s;et up new
&s;ects in religion: &s;ome of them cropt their hair &s;hort, and called
them&s;elves the <HI>enlightened</HI>; &s;ome fell into trances, and pretended
to &s;ee holy vi&s;ions; while others got into tubs, and held forth, with many
whinings, and groans, and &s;nuffling through the no&s;e. In the merry days of
King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd, NONSENSE a&s;&s;umed a more gay and
libertine air; and her progeny, from fana|tics, became downright infidels.
Several courtiers of the family wrote lewd plays, as well as lu&s;cious
love-&s;ongs, and other loo&s;e ver&s;es, which were collected together, and
greedily bought up in mi&s;cellanies. In the &s;ucceeding reign, &s;ome of the
kindred, who had received their edu|cation at St. <HI>Omers,</HI> thought
them&s;elves on the point of e&s;tabli&s;hing NONSENSE in church and &s;tate,
and were preparing to make bonfires on the occa&s;ion in <HI>Smithfield,</HI>
when they were obliged to leave the kingdom.</P>
<P>Since the Revolution, the field of Politics has afforded large
&s;cope for NONSENSE and her family to make <PB N="713" REF="288"> them&s;elves
remarkable. Hence aro&s;e the various &s;ects in party, di&s;tingui&s;hed by
the names of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory, Mini&s;terial</HI> and <HI>Jacobite,
Sunderlandians, Oxfordians, Go|dolphinians, Bolingbrokians, Walpolians,
Pelhamians, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> names, which have kindled as hot a war
in pamphlets and journals, as the <HI>Guelphs</HI> and <HI>Gibilines</HI> in
<HI>Italy,</HI> or the <HI>Big</HI> and <HI>Little-Endians</HI> in the kingdom
of <HI>Lilliput.</HI></P>
<P>I have here endeavoured to give a &s;hort abridgement of the
Hi&s;tory of NONSENSE; though a very &s;mall part of the exploits of the family
can be included in &s;o com|pendious a chronicle. Some of them were very deep
&s;cho|lars, and filled the Profe&s;&s;ors' Chairs at the Univer&s;ities. They
compo&s;ed many elaborate di&s;&s;ertations to convince the world, that two and
two make four; and di&s;covered by dint of &s;yllogi&s;m, that white is not
black. Their enquiries in Natural Philo&s;ophy were no le&s;s extraordi|nary:
many &s;pent their lives and their fortunes in at|tempting to di&s;cover a
wonderful Stone, that &s;hould turn every ba&s;er metal into gold; and others
employed them|&s;elves in making artificial wings, by the help of which they
&s;hould fly up into the world of the moon. Another branch of the family took
to the <HI>Belles Lettres,</HI> and were the original founders of the learned
Society of <HI>Grub-Street.</HI></P>
<P>Never was any aera in the annals of NONSENSE more illu&s;trious
than the pre&s;ent; nor did that noble family ever more &s;ignally
di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf in every occupation. In Oratory, who are greater
proficients than the progeny of NONSENSE? Witne&s;s many long and eloquent
&s;peeches delivered in St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Chapel, in
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Hall, at A&s;&s;izes and Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions, at
<HI>Clare-Market,</HI> and the <HI>Robin-Hood.</HI>&mdash;In Philo&s;ophy, what
marvellous things have not been proved by NONSENSE? The &s;ometime
Profe&s;&s;or of A&s;tronomy at <HI>Gre&s;ham</HI> College &s;hewed Sir
<HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> to be a mere a&s;s, and wire|drawed 
<PB N="714" REF="289"> the books of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> into a complete &s;y&s;tem
of Natural Philo&s;ophy: Life-guard-men have with the ut|mo&s;t certainty of
NONSENSE foretold Earthquakes; and others have penned curious e&s;&s;ays on
Air-quakes, Water|quakes, and Comets.&mdash;In Politics, how &s;ucce&s;sfully
have the &s;ons of NONSENSE bandied about the terms of Court and Country? How
wi&s;ely have they debated upon Taxes; and with what amazing penetration did
they but lately fore&s;ee an Inva&s;ion?&mdash;In Religion, their domain is
particularly exten&s;ive: for, though NONSENSE is ex|cluded at lea&s;t from the
fir&s;t part of the &s;ervice in all regular churches, yet &s;he often occupies
the whole cere|mony at the Tabernacle and Foundery in <HI>Moorfields,</HI> and
the Chapel in <HI>Long-Acre.</HI> But for the credit of &s;o po|lite an age, be
it known, that the children of NON|SENSE, who are many of them people of
fa&s;hion, are as often &s;een at the Play-hou&s;e as at Church: and it is
&s;omething &s;trange, that the family of NONSENSE is now divided again&s;t
it&s;elf, and in high conte&s;t about the management of their favourite
amu&s;ement&mdash;the OPERA.</P>

<P>_THERE is no mark of our confidence taken more kindly by a
friend, than the intru&s;ting him with a &s;ecret; nor any which he is &s;o
likely to abu&s;e. Confidantes in general are like crazy fire-locks, which are
no &s;ooner charged and cocked, than the &s;pring gives way, and the report
immediately follows. Happy to have been thought worthy the confidence of one
friend, they are impatient to manife&s;t their importance to another; 'till
between them and their friend, and their friend's friend, the whole matter is
pre&s;ently known to <HI>all our friends round the Wrekin.</HI> The &s;ecret
catches as it were by contact, and like electrical matter breaks forth from
every link in the chain, almo&s;t at the <PB N="716" REF="291"> &s;ame
in&s;tant. Thus the whole Exchange may be thrown into a buz to morrow, by what
was whi&s;pered in the middle of <HI>Marlborough Downs</HI> this morning; and
in a week's time the &s;treets may ring with the intrigue of a woman of
fa&s;hion, bellowed out from the foul mouths of the hawkers, though at
pre&s;ent it is known to no creature living but her gallant and her
waiting-maid.</P>
<P>AS the talent of &s;ecrecy is of &s;o great importance to
&s;ociety, and the nece&s;&s;ary commerce between individuals cannot be
&s;ecurely carried on without it, that this deplorable weakne&s;s &s;hould be
&s;o general is much to be lamented. You may as well pour water into a funnel,
or a &s;ieve, and expect it to be retained there, as commit any of your
concerns to &s;o &s;lippery a companion. It is remarkable, that in tho&s;e men
who have thus lo&s;t the faculty of retention, the de&s;ire of being
communicative is always mo&s;t prevalent where it is lea&s;t to be ju&s;tified.
If they are intru&s;ted with a matter of no great moment, affairs of more
con&s;equence will perhaps in a few hours &s;huffle it entirely out of their
thoughts: but if any thing be delivered to them with an air of earne&s;tne&s;s,
a low voice, and the ge&s;ture of a man in terror for the con|&s;equence of
it's being known; if the door is bolted, and every precaution taken to prevent
a &s;urpri&s;e; however they may promi&s;e &s;ecrecy, and however they may
intend it, the weight upon their minds will be &s;o extremely oppre&s;&s;ive,
that it will certainly put their tongues in motion.</P>
<P>THIS breach of tru&s;t &s;o univer&s;al among&s;t us, is perhaps
in great mea&s;ure owing to our education. The fir&s;t le&s;&s;on our little
ma&s;ters and mi&s;&s;es are taught, is to become blabs and tell-tales; they
are bribed to divulge the petty intrigues <PB N="717" REF="292"> of the family
below &s;tairs to pappa and mamma in the parlour, and a doll or a hobby-hor&s;e
is generally the encou|ragement of a propen&s;ity which could &s;carcely be
attoned for by a whipping. As &s;oon as children can li&s;p out the little
intelligence they have picked up in the hall or the kit|chen, they are admired
for their wit: if the butler has been caught ki&s;&s;ing the hou&s;ekeeper in
his pantry, or the foot|man detected in romping with the chambermaid, away
flies little <HI>Tommy</HI> or <HI>Bet&s;y</HI> with the news; the parents are
lo&s;t in admiration of the pretty rogue's under&s;tanding, and reward &s;uch
uncommon ingenuity with a ki&s;s and a &s;ugar-plumb.</P>
<P>NOR does an inclination to &s;ecrecy meet with le&s;s
encou|ragement at &s;chool. The governantes at the boarding-&s;chool teach
mi&s;s to be a good girl, and tell them every thing &s;he knows: thus, if any
young lady is unfortunately di&s;covered eating a green apple in a corner, if
&s;he is heard to pronounce a naughty word, or is caught picking the letters
out of another mi&s;s's &s;ampler, away runs the chit who is &s;o happy as to
get the &s;tart of the re&s;t, &s;creams out her information as &s;he goes, and
the prudent matron chucks her under the chin, and tells her that &s;he is a
good girl, and every body will love her.</P>
<P>THE management of our young gentlemen is equally ab&s;urd: In
mo&s;t of our &s;chools if a lad is di&s;covered in a &s;crape, the impeachment
of an accomplice, as at the <HI>Old Bailey,</HI> is made the condition of a
pardon. I remember a boy, engaged in robbing an orchard, who was unfortunately
taken pri&s;oner in an apple-tree, and conducted under a &s;trong guard of the
farmer and his dairy-maid, to the ma&s;ter's hou&s;e. Upon his ab&s;olute
refu&s;al to di&s;cover his a&s;&s;ociates, <PB N="718" REF="293"> the
pedagogue undertook to la&s;h him out of his fidelity, but finding it
impo&s;&s;ible to &s;courge the &s;ecret out of him, he at la&s;t gave him up
for an ob&s;tinate villain, and &s;ent him to his father, who told him he was
ruined, and was going to di&s;|inherit him for not betraying his
&s;chool-fellows. I mu&s;t own I am not fond of thus drubbing our youth into
treachery, and am much more plea&s;ed with the reque&s;t of
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> when he went to <HI>Troy,</HI> who begged of tho&s;e who
were to have the charge of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> that they would above all
things teach him to be ju&s;t, &s;incere, faithful, and to keep a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>EVERY man's experience mu&s;t have furni&s;hed him with
in&s;tances of confidantes who are not to be relied on, and friends who are not
to be tru&s;ted; but few perhaps have thought it a character &s;o well worth
their attention, as to have marked out the different degrees into which it may
be di|vided, and the different methods by which &s;ecrets are communicated.</P>
<P>NED TRUSTY is a tell-tale of a very &s;ingular kind. Ha|ving
&s;ome &s;en&s;e of his duty, he he&s;itates a little at the breach of it. If
he engages never to utter a &s;yllable, he mo&s;t punctually performs his
promi&s;e; but then he has the knack of in&s;inuating by a nod and a &s;hrug
well-timed, or a &s;ea|&s;onable leer, as much as others can convey in
expre&s;s terms. It is difficult, in &s;hort, to determine, whether he is more
to be admired for his re&s;olution in not mentioning, or his in|genuity in
di&s;clo&s;ing a &s;ecret. He is al&s;o excellent at a 
<Q REND="inline">"doubtful phra&s;e"</Q> as Hamlet calls it, or
an 
<Q REND="inline">"ambiguous giving out,"</Q> and his
conver&s;ation con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of &s;uch broken innuendos 
<Q><PB N="719" REF="294"> 
<L>As, well, I know&mdash;or, I could&mdash;an if I
would&mdash;</L> 
<L>Or, if I li&s;t to &s;peak&mdash;or, there be, an if there
might &amp;c.</L></Q> Here he generally &s;tops; and leaves it to his hearers
to draw proper inferences from the&s;e piece-meal premi&s;es. With due
encouragement however, he may be prevailed on to &s;lip the padlock from his
lips, and immediately overwhelms you with a torrent of &s;ecret hi&s;tory,
which ru&s;hes forth with more violence for having been &s;o long confined.</P>
<P>POOR MEANWELL, though he never fails to tran&s;gre&s;s, is
rather to be pitied than condemned. To tru&s;t him with a &s;ecret, is to
&s;poil his appetite, to break his re&s;t, and to deprive him for a time of
every earthly enjoyment. Like a man who travels with his whole fortune in his
pocket, he is terrified if you approach him, and immediately &s;u&s;pects that
you come with a felonious intent to rob him of his charge. If he ventures
abroad, it is to walk in &s;ome unfre|quented place, where he is lea&s;t in
danger of an attack. At home, he &s;huts him&s;elf up from his family, paces it
to and fro' in his chamber, and has no relief but from muttering over to
him&s;elf, what he longs to publi&s;h to the world; and would gladly &s;ubmit
to the office of town cryer, for the li|berty of proclaiming it in the market
place. At length however, weary of his burthen, and re&s;olved to bear it no
longer, he con&s;igns it to the cu&s;tody of the fir&s;t friend he meets, and
returns to his wife with a cheerful a&s;pect, and wonderfully altered for the
better.</P>
<P>CARELESS is perhaps equally unde&s;igning, though not equally
excu&s;able. Intru&s;t him with an affair of the utmo&s;t importance, on the
concealment of which your fortune and happine&s;s depend: he hears you with a
kind of half-atten|tion; <PB N="720" REF="295"> whi&s;tles a favourite air, and
accompanies it with the drumming of his fingers upon the table. As &s;oon as
your narration is ended, or perhaps in the middle of it, he a&s;ks your opinion
of his &s;word-knot, damns his taylor for having dre&s;&s;ed him in a
&s;nuff-colour'd coat in&s;tead of a <HI>pompadour,</HI> and leaves you in
ha&s;te to attend an auction; where, as if he meant to di&s;po&s;e of his
intelligence to the be&s;t bidder, he divulges it with a voice as loud as the
auctioneer's; and when you tax him with having played you fal&s;e, he is
hear|tily &s;orry for it, but never knew that it was to be a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e I might add the character of the open and
un|re&s;erved, who thinks it a breach of friend&s;hip to conceal any thing from
his intimates; and the impertinent, who ha|ving by dint of ob&s;ervation made
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of your &s;ecret, imagines he may lawfully publi&s;h the
knowledge it has co&s;t him &s;o much labour to obtain, and con&s;iders that
privilege, as the reward due to his indu&s;try. But I &s;hall leave the&s;e
with many other characters, which my reader's own experience may &s;ugge&s;t to
him, and conclude with pre|&s;cribing, as a &s;hort remedy for this
evil,&mdash;That no man may betray the coun&s;el of his friend, let every man
keep his own.</P>

<P>_TASTE is at pre&s;ent the darling idol of the polite world, and
the world of letters; and, indeed, &s;eems to be con&s;idered as the
quin|te&s;&s;ence of almo&s;t all the arts and &s;ciences. The fine ladies and
gentlemen dre&s;s with Ta&s;te; the architects, whether <HI>Gothic</HI> or
<HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> build with Ta&s;te; the painters paint with Ta&s;te; the
poets write with Ta&s;te; critics read with Ta&s;te; and in &s;hort, fidlers,
players, &s;ingers, dancers, and mechanics them&s;elves, are all the &s;ons and
daughters of Ta&s;te. Yet in this amazing &s;uper|abundancy of Ta&s;te few can
&s;ay what it really is, or what the word it&s;elf &s;ignifies. Should I
attempt to define it in the &s;tile of a <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur,</HI> I mu&s;t run
over the names of all the famous poets, painters, and &s;culptors, ancient and
mo|dern; <PB N="722" REF="297"> and after having pompou&s;ly harangued on the
excel|lencies of <HI>Apelles, Phidias, Praxiteles, Angela, Rubens,
Pou&s;&s;in,</HI> and <HI>Dominichino,</HI> with a word or two on all
<HI>ta&s;te|ful</HI> compo&s;itions, &s;uch as tho&s;e of <HI>Homer, Virgil,
Ta&s;&s;o, Dante,</HI> and <HI>Ario&s;to,</HI> I &s;hould leave the reader in
wonder of my profound erudition, and as little informed as before. But as deep
learning, though more flaming and pompous, is perhaps not always &s;o u&s;eful
as common &s;en&s;e, I &s;hall endeavour to get at the true meaning of the word
Ta&s;te, by con&s;idering what it u&s;ually imports in familiar writings and
ordinary conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>IT is &s;uppo&s;ed by <HI>Locke</HI> and other clo&s;e
rea&s;oners, that words are intended as &s;igns of our ideas: but daily
expe|rience will convince us, that words are often u&s;ed to expre&s;s no ideas
at all. Thus many per&s;ons, who talk perpetually of Ta&s;te, throw it out as a
mere expletive, without any meaning annexed to it. <HI>Bardolph,</HI> when
demanded the meaning of the word <HI>accommodated,</HI> wi&s;ely explains it by
&s;ay|ing that 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>accommodated,</HI> &s;ir,
is&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;<HI>accommodated,</HI> &s;ir, is as if one
&s;hould &s;ay&mdash;a&mdash;<HI>accommodated:</HI>"</Q> and if in like manner,
you a&s;k one of the&s;e people <HI>What is Ta&s;te?</HI> they will tell you
that "Ta&s;te is a kind of a &s;ort of a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;, in &s;hort 
<Q REND="inline">"Ta&s;te is Ta&s;te."</Q> The&s;e talkers mu&s;t
be con|&s;idered as ab&s;olute blanks in conver&s;ation, &s;ince it is
im|po&s;&s;ible to learn the explanation of a term from them, as they affix no
determinate meaning to any expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>AMONG men of &s;en&s;e, who&s;e words carry meaning in their
&s;ound, Ta&s;te is commonly u&s;ed in one of the&s;e two &s;ignifications.
Fir&s;t, when they give any per&s;on the ap|pellation of a Man of Ta&s;te, they
would intimate that he <PB N="723" REF="298"> has a turn for the polite arts,
as well as the le&s;&s;er elegancies of life; and that from his natural bent to
tho&s;e &s;tudies, and his acquired knowledge in them, he is capable of
di&s;tin|gui&s;hing what is good or bad in any thing of that kind &s;ubmitted
to his judgment. The meaning at other times implied by a Man of Ta&s;te is,
that he is not only &s;o far an adept in tho&s;e matters as to be able to judge
of them ac|curately, but is al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the faculty of
executing them gracefully. The&s;e two &s;ignifications will perhaps be more
ea&s;ily conceived, and clearly illu&s;trated, when applied to our Sen&s;ual
Ta&s;te. The Man of Ta&s;te, according to the fir&s;t, may be con&s;idered as a
<HI>Bon Vivant,</HI> who is fond of the di&s;hes before him, and
di&s;tingui&s;hes nicely what is &s;avoury and delicious, or flat and in&s;ipid
in the ingredients of each: according to the &s;econd, he may be regarded as
the Cook, who from knowing what things will mix well together, and
di&s;tingui&s;hing by a nice ta&s;te when he has arrived at that happy mixture,
is able to compo&s;e &s;uch exqui&s;ite di&s;hes.</P>
<P>BOTH the&s;e &s;ignifications of the word will be found
agree|able to the following definition of it, which I have &s;ome|where &s;een,
and is the only ju&s;t de&s;cription of the term, that I ever remember to have
met with. 
<Q REND="inline">"Ta&s;te con&s;i&s;ts in a nice harmony between
the Fancy and the Judgment."</Q> The mo&s;t cha&s;ti&s;ed judgment, without
genius, can never con&s;titute a Man of Ta&s;te; and the mo&s;t luxuriant
Imagina|tion, unregulated by Judgment, will only carry us into wild and
extravagant deviations from it. To mix oil, vinegar, butter, milk, eggs,
&amp;c. incoherently together, would make an Olio not to be reli&s;hed by any
palate; and the man who has no go&ucirc;t for delicacies him&s;elf will never
compo&s;e a good <PB N="724" REF="299"> di&s;h, though he &s;hould ever &s;o
&s;trictly adhere to the rules of <HI>La Chapelle, Hannah Gla&s;&s;e,</HI> and
<HI>Martha Bradley.</HI> I con|fine my&s;elf at pre&s;ent chiefly to that
&s;ignification of the word, which implies the capacity of exerting our own
facul|ties in the &s;everal branches of Ta&s;te, becau&s;e That always includes
the other.</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;ettled what Ta&s;te is, it may not be
unen|tertaining to examine modern Ta&s;te by the&s;e rules: and perhaps it will
appear, that on the one hand its mo&s;t plea&s;ing flights and ravi&s;hing
elegancies are extravagant and ab&s;urd, and that on the other hand tho&s;e who
affect a correct Ta&s;te in all their undertakings, proceed mechanically
without ge|nius. The fir&s;t &s;pecies of Ta&s;te, which gives a loo&s;e to the
imagination, indulges it&s;elf in caprice, and is perpetually &s;triking new
&s;trokes, is the chief regulator of the fa&s;hion. In dre&s;s, it has put
hunting-poles into the hands of our gentlemen, and erected coaches and
windmills on the heads of our ladies. In equipage, it has built chariots of
<HI>papier mach&eacute;,</HI> and by putting &s;potted <HI>Dani&s;h</HI>
hor&s;es into the harne&s;s, has made our beaux look like <HI>Bacchus</HI> in
his car drawn by leopards. The ornaments, both on the out&s;ide and in&s;ide of
our hou&s;es, are all <HI>Gothic</HI> or <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>; and whoever makes
a pagod of his parlour, throws a plank or two with an irre|gular cro&s;s-barred
paling over a dirty ditch, or places battle|ments on a root-hou&s;e or a
&s;table, fits up his hou&s;e and garden entirely in Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd &s;ort of Men of Ta&s;te are to be found chiefly
among the Literati, and are tho&s;e, who de&s;pi&s;ing the mo|dern whims to
which fa&s;hion has given the name of Ta&s;te, pretend to follow with the
mo&s;t &s;crupulous exactne&s;s the <PB N="725" REF="300"> cha&s;te models of
the antients. The&s;e are the poets who favour us with correct, epithetical,
and <HI>ta&s;teful</HI> compo&s;itions; who&s;e works are without blemi&s;h,
and conformable to the preci&s;e rules of <HI>Quintilian, Horace,</HI> and
<HI>Ari&s;totle:</HI> and as they are intended merely for the peru&s;al of
per&s;ons of the mo&s;t refined Ta&s;te, it is no wonder that they are above
the level of common under&s;tandings. The&s;e too are the Critics, who in their
comments upon authors, embarra&s;s us with repeated allu&s;ions to the &s;tudy
of <HI>Virt&ugrave;:</HI> And the&s;e too are the Connoi&s;&s;eurs in
Architecture, who build ruins after <HI>Vi|truvius,</HI> and nece&s;&s;aries
according to <HI>Palladio.</HI> One gentle|man of this ca&s;t has built his
villa upon a bleak hill, with four &s;pacious porticos, open on each &s;ide to
court the four winds; becau&s;e, in the &s;ultry regions of <HI>Italy,</HI>
this model has been thought mo&s;t convenient; and another has, in great
mea&s;ure, &s;hut out the light from his apartments, and cut off all pro&s;pect
from his windows, by erecting an high wall be|fore his hou&s;e, which in
<HI>Italy</HI> has been judged nece&s;&s;ary to &s;creen them from the
&s;un.</P>
<P>ARCHITECTURE &s;eems indeed to be the main article, in which the
efforts of Ta&s;te are now di&s;played. Among tho&s;e who are fond of exerting
their fancies in capricious innova|tions, I might in&s;tance the many pretty
whims, of which an infinite variety may be &s;een within ten miles of
<HI>London.</HI> But us a proof of the noble and judicious Ta&s;te among us, I
&s;hall beg leave to de&s;cribe, in the &s;tile of a Connoi&s;&s;eur, a mo&s;t
amazing curio&s;ity, erected in a very polite quarter of this town.</P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of a noble and &s;pacious area &s;tands a grand
Obeli&s;k. The Ba&s;e forms a perfect &s;quare with right <PB N="726" REF="301"> angles; the Body of it is cylindrical; but the Capital is an
Heptagon, and has &s;everal curious lines and figures de&s;cribed on each of
its &s;even flat &s;ides or &s;uperfices, which &s;erve to terminate as many
mo&s;t magnificent and &s;triking Vi&s;tas. This &s;uperb Column, no le&s;s
remarkable than the famous Pillar of <HI>Trajan,</HI> &s;eems (from the
&s;everal Gnomons and other Hieroglyphics &s;tuck about it) to have been
originally dedicated to the Sun; but is now known among the vulgar by the more
common name of <HI>The Seven Dials.</HI></P>

<P>_THOUGH I &s;hall not as yet vouch&s;afe to let the reader &s;o
far into my &s;ecrets, as to inform him whether I am married or &s;ingle, it
may not be ami&s;s to ac|quaint him, that &s;uppo&s;ing I &s;till remain a
batchelor, it has not been the fault of my friends or relations. On the
contrary, as &s;oon as I was what they call &s;ettled in the world, they were
&s;o a&s;&s;iduous in looking out for a wife for me, that nothing 
<PB N="728" REF="303"> was required on my part, but immediately to fall in love
with the lady they had pitched upon: and could I have complied with their
&s;everal choices, I &s;hould have been married at the &s;ame time to a tall
and a &s;hort, a plump and a &s;lender, a young and an old woman; one with a
great deal of money, and another with none at all: each of whom were
&s;eparately recommended by them as the propere&s;t per&s;on in the world for
me.</P>
<P>I know not how it happens, but it is notorious, that mo&s;t
people take a plea&s;ure in making matches; either thinking matrimony a &s;tate
of bli&s;s, into which they would charitably call all their friends and
acquaintance; or perhaps &s;truggling in the toils, they are de&s;irous of
catching others in the net that en&s;nared them. Many matches have been brought
about between two per&s;ons ab&s;olute &s;trangers to each other, through this
kind mediation of our friends, who are always ready to take upon them the
office of an honourable go-between. Some have come together merely from having
been talked of by their acquaintance as likely to make a match; and I have
known a couple, who have met by accident at an hor&s;e-race, or danced together
at an a&s;&s;embly, that in le&s;s than a fortnight have been driven into
matrimony in their own defence, by having been fir&s;t paired in private
conver&s;ations, and afterwards in the common news-papers.</P>
<P>As we cannot in&s;ure happine&s;s to our friends, at the &s;ame
time that we help them to hu&s;bands or wives, one would imagine that few would
care to run the ha|zard <PB N="729" REF="304"> of be&s;towing mi&s;ery, where
they meant a kindne&s;s. I know a good-natured lady, who has officiou&s;ly
brought upon her&s;elf the ill-will and the cur&s;es of many of her deare&s;t
and mo&s;t intimate friends on this very account. She has a &s;i&s;ter, for
whom &s;he provided a mo&s;t excellent hu&s;band, who has &s;hewn his affection
for her by &s;pend|ing her whole fortune upon his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es: &s;he
con|trived, that another near relation &s;hould &s;nap up a rich widow, who was
arre&s;ted for her debts within a week after marriage; and it co&s;t her a
whole twelvemonth to bring two doating lovers of her acquaintance together, who
parted beds before the honey-moon was expired.</P>
<P>But if our friends will thus conde&s;cend to be Match-makers
from a &s;pirit of benevolence, and for our own ad|vantage only, there are
others who have taken up the pro|fe&s;&s;ion from le&s;s di&s;intere&s;ted
motives; who bring beauty and fortune to market, and traffick in all the
accompli&s;h|ments that can make the marriage &s;tate happy. The&s;e traders
di&s;po&s;e of all &s;orts of rich heirs and heire&s;&s;es, ba|ronets, lords,
ladies of fa&s;hion, and daughters of country &s;quires with as much coolne&s;s
as drovers &s;ell bullocks. They keep complete regi&s;ters of the condition and
quali|fications of all the marriageable per&s;ons within the king|dom; and it
is as common to apply to them for an hu&s;band or wife, as to the
regi&s;ter-offices for a man or maid-&s;ervant. They may, indeed, be
con&s;idered as fa|thers and guardians for the greate&s;t part of our youth of
both &s;exes, &s;ince in marriage they may be mo&s;t properly &s;aid to give
them away.</P>
<P><PB N="730" REF="305">It is &s;omething comical to con&s;ider
the various per&s;ons, to whom men of this profe&s;&s;ion are u&s;eful. We may
naturally &s;uppo&s;e, that a young fellow, who has no e&s;tate, but what, like
<HI>Tin&s;el</HI>'s in the <HI>Drummer,</HI> is merely <HI>per&s;onal,</HI>
would be glad to come down hand&s;omely after con&s;ummation with a woman of
fortune; and a &s;mart girl, who has more charms than wealth, would give round
poundage on being taken for better for wor&s;e by a rich heir. Many a
trade&s;man al&s;o wants a wife to manage his family, while he looks after the
&s;hop; and thinks it better to recommend him&s;elf by this convenient friend,
than by means of the <HI>Daily Adverti&s;er.</HI> There are al&s;o &s;everal
young people, who are indifferent as to any per&s;on in particular, and have no
pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;tate it&s;elf, yet want to be married, becau&s;e it will
deliver them from the re&s;traint of parents. But the mo&s;t unnatural, though
very common applications of this &s;ort are from the rich and the noble; who
having immen&s;e e&s;tates to be&s;tow on their children, will make u&s;e of
the meane&s;t in&s;truments to couple them to another of the &s;ame over|grown
fortune.</P>
<P>I have known many droll accidents happen from the mi&s;takes of
the&s;e mercenary Match-makers, and remem|ber one in particular, which I
&s;hall here &s;et down for the entertainment of my readers. A careful old
gen|tleman came up from the North on purpo&s;e to marry his &s;on, and was
recommended by one of the&s;e couplers to a twenty thou&s;and pounder. He
accordingly put on his be&s;t wig, be&s;t beaver, and gold-buttoned coat, and
went to pay his re&s;pects to the lady's mamma: He told her, 
<PB N="731" REF="306"> that he had not the plea&s;ure of being known to her;
but as his &s;on's quiet depended on it, he had taken the liberty of waiting on
her: in &s;hort, he at length broke the matter to her, and informed her, that
his boy had &s;een her daughter at church, and was violently in love with her;
concluding, that he would do very hand|&s;omely for the lad, and would make it
worth her while to have him. The old lady thanked him for the ho|nour he
intended her family; but &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, to be &s;ure, as he appeared to be
a prudent and &s;en&s;ible gentle|tleman he would expect a fortune
an&s;werable. 
<Q REND="inline">"Say nothing of that, madam, &s;ay nothing of

<Q REND="inline">"I have heard&mdash;but if it was le&s;s, it

<Q REND="inline">"Pray, &s;ir, how much does the world

<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Not &s;o much, &s;ir;</HI>"</Q> &s;aid the

<P>_I MENTIONED in a former paper, that a friend of mine was
writing <HI>A New Treati&s;e on Ethics,</HI> or, <HI>A Sy&s;tem of Immoral
Philo&s;ophy,</HI> compiled from the principles and practice of the pre&s;ent
age; in which the extraordinary mode&s;ty of the Mo|derns would be enlarged on,
which has induced them to comprehend all the vices, in&s;tead of virtues, in
their idea of a Fine Gentleman. The work is now fini&s;hed; and the Author has
&s;ent me the following letter concerning the Dedication, with leave to
&s;ubmit it to the public.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="734" REF="309">
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>DEAR TOWN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE flatne&s;s and ful&s;om in&s;ipidity of Dedications has
often been the &s;ubject of our conver&s;ation; and we have always agreed, that
Authors have mi&s;carried in the&s;e pieces of flattery, by injudiciou&s;ly
affronting, when they meant to compliment their patrons. The humble Dedicator
loads his Great Man with virtues totally foreign to his nature and
di&s;po&s;ition, which &s;it as aukwardly upon him, as lace or embroidery on a
chimney-&s;weeper: and &s;o overwhelms him with the huge ma&s;s of learning,
with which he graciou&s;ly dubs him a &s;cholar, that he makes as ridiculous a
figure as the A&s;s in the <HI>Dunciad.</HI> After having thus beprai&s;ed his
patron, till the new <HI>Maecenas</HI> is heartily a&s;hamed of him&s;elf, he
wonders that no notice is taken of &s;o pompous an eulogium, and that a
Dedi|cation &s;hould be as mere a drug as a &s;ermon.</P>
<P><HI>Lory</HI> in the <HI>Relap&s;e</HI> advi&s;es
<HI>Fa&s;hion</HI> to get into the good graces of Lord <HI>Foppington</HI> by
falling in love with his coat, being in raptures with his peruke, ravi&s;hed
with the gen|teel dangle of his &s;word-knot; and, in &s;hort, to recom|mend
him&s;elf to his noble elder brother, by &s;eeming to be captivated with his
favourites. In like manner, the au|thor, who would make his Dedication really
valuable, &s;hould not talk to his patron of his honour, and virtue, and
integrity, and a pack of unfa&s;hionable qualities, which only &s;erve to
di&s;grace a Fine Gentleman, but boldly paint him what he really is, and at the
&s;ame time convince him of his merit in being a fool, and his glory in being a
&s;coundrel. This mode of Dedication, though proper at all times, will appear
with a particular good grace, before a <HI>Sy&s;tem of Immoral
Philo&s;ophy:</HI> where|fore, <PB N="735" REF="310"> as my book is now
fini&s;hed, I have here &s;ent you a rough draught of the Epi&s;tle Dedicatory,
and &s;hall be glad to hear your opinion of it.</P>
<Q><HI>May it plea&s;e your Grace!</HI> or, <HI>My Lord!</HI> or,
<HI>Sir!</HI></Q>
<P>YOU are in every point &s;o complete a Fine Gentle|man, that
the following treati&s;e is but a faint tran&s;cript of your accompli&s;hments.
There is not one qualification, requi&s;ite in the character of a man of
&s;pirit, which you do not po&s;&s;e&s;s. Give me leave therefore, on the
pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to point forth your ine&s;timable qualities to the world,
and hold up to the public view &s;o glorious an example.</P>
<P>YOU di&s;tingui&s;hed your&s;elf &s;o early in life, and
exalted your&s;elf &s;o far above the common pitch of vulgar Bucks, that you
was di&s;tingui&s;hed, before the age of twenty, with the noble appellation of
STAG. And when I con|&s;ider the many gallant exploits you have performed, the
number of ra&s;cally poltroons you have &s;ent out of the world, the number of
pretty little foundlings you have brought into it, how many girls you have
debauched, how many women of quality you have intrigued with, and how many
hog&s;heads of <HI>French</HI> wine have run through your body, I cannot help
contemplating you as a STAG of the fir&s;t head.</P>
<P>WHAT great rea&s;on have you to value your&s;elf on your noble
Atchievements at <HI>Arthur</HI>'s! the &s;ums you formerly lo&s;t, and tho&s;e
you have lately won, are amazing in&s;tances of your &s;pirit and addre&s;s;
fir&s;t, in venturing &s;o deeply before you was let into the &s;ecret, and
then, in manag|ing it with &s;o much adroitne&s;s and dexterity, &s;ince you 
<PB N="736" REF="311"> have been acquainted with it. Nobody cogs the dice, or
packs the cards half &s;o &s;kilfully; you hedge a bet with uncommon nicety;
and are a mo&s;t incomparably &s;hrewd judge of the odds.</P>
<P>NOR have your exploits on the Turf rendered you le&s;s famous.
Let the annals of <HI>Pond</HI> and <HI>Heber</HI> deliver down to po&s;terity
the glorious account of what plates you have won, what matches you made, and
how often the Knowing Ones have been taken in, when, for private rea&s;ons, you
have found it nece&s;&s;ary that your hor&s;e &s;hould run on the wrong &s;ide
of the po&s;t, or be di|&s;tanced, after winning the fir&s;t heat. I need not
mention your own &s;kill in Hor&s;eman&s;hip, and in how many matches you have
conde&s;cended to ride your&s;elf; for in this particular it mu&s;t be
acknowledged that you cannot be outdone even by your groom or jockey.</P>
<P>ALL the world will witne&s;s the many in&s;tances of your
Courage, which has been often tried and exerted in <HI>Hyde-Park,</HI> and
behind <HI>Montague-Hou&s;e:</HI> nay, you have &s;ometimes been known to draw
your &s;word mo&s;t heroicly at the opera, the play, and even at private routes
and a&s;&s;emblies. How often have you put to flight a whole army of watchmen,
con&s;tables, and beadles, with the ju&s;tices at their head! You have cleared
a whole bawdy-hou&s;e before you, and taken many a tavern by &s;torm: you have
pinned a waiter to the ground, and have be&s;ides proved your&s;elf an
ex|cellent mark&s;man, by &s;hooting a po&s;t-boy flying. With &s;o much valour
and firmne&s;s, it is not to be doubted, but that you would behave with the
&s;ame intrepidity, if occa&s;ions called, upon <HI>Houn&s;low-Heath,</HI> or
in <HI>Maiden-head-Thicket:</HI> <PB N="737" REF="312"> and, if it were
nece&s;&s;ary, you would as boldly re&s;ign your&s;elf up to the hands of
<HI>Jack Ketch,</HI> and &s;wing as genteely as <HI>Maclean</HI> or
<HI>Gentleman Harry.</HI> The &s;ame noble &s;pirit would likewi&s;e enable you
to aim the pi&s;tol at your own head, and go out of the world like a man of
honour and a gentleman.</P>
<P>BUT your Courage has not rendered you in&s;u&s;ceptible of the
&s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions, for which your heart has been ever inclined. To &s;ay
nothing of your gallantries with women of fa&s;hion, your intrigues with
milliners and mantua-makers, or your &s;educing of raw country girls, and
innocent trade&s;mens daughters, you have formerly been &s;o con&s;tant in your
devoirs to Mrs. <HI>Dougla&s;s,</HI> and the whole &s;i&s;ter-hood, that you
&s;acrificed your health and con&s;titution in their &s;ervice. But above all,
witne&s;s that &s;weet delicate creature, whom you have now in keeping; and for
whom you entertain &s;uch a &s;trong and faithful pa&s;&s;ion, that for her
&s;ake you have tenderly and affectionately de&s;erted your wife and
family.</P>
<P>THOUGH from your elegant ta&s;te for plea&s;ures you appear
made for the gay world, yet the&s;e polite Amu&s;e|ments have not called off
your attention from the more &s;erious &s;tudies of Politics and Religion. In
Politics you have made &s;uch a wonderful proficiency, both in theory and
practice, that you have di&s;covered the good of your country to be a mere
joke, and confirmed your own intere&s;t, as well as e&s;tabli&s;hed your
con&s;e|quence in the proper place, by &s;ecuring half a dozen Boroughs. As to
Religion, you &s;oon unravelled every my&s;tery of that, and not only know the
Bible to be as romantic as the Alcoran, but have al&s;o written &s;everal 
<PB N="738" REF="313"> volumes to make your di&s;coveries plain to meaner
capa|cities. The ridiculous prejudices of a fooli&s;h world un|happily prevent
your publi&s;hing them at pre&s;ent; but you have wi&s;ely provided that they
&s;hall one day &s;ee the light, when I doubt not they will be deemed
invaluable, and be as univer&s;ally admired as the po&s;thumous works of Lord
<HI>Bolingbroke.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, May it plea&s;e your Grace, <HI>or,</HI> My
Lord, <HI>or,</HI> Sir, in humble admiration of your excellencies, <HI>&amp;c.

<P>_THE notices in the public papers that the Foundling Ho&s;pital
will be open for the reception of all infants in general under a certain age,
have, I find, given uni|ver&s;al &s;atisfaction. The con&s;equences of a big
belly do not appear &s;o dreadful as heretofore: and it was but ye&s;terday
that a young fellow of intrigue told me, he was happy that his children would
no longer be thrown out of the Ho&s;pital, as he him&s;elf was out of
<HI>Arthur</HI>'s, by black balls. For my part, though I have no lady in
keeping, no child by my hou&s;e-keeper, nor any other affair of gallantry on my
<PB N="740" REF="315"> hands, which makes me wi&s;h to &s;well the number of
infants maintained by that charity, I mu&s;t own my&s;elf to be exceedingly
rejoiced at the exten&s;ion of &s;o benevo|lent a de&s;ign. I look upon it as
the certain pre&s;ervation of many hundreds in embryo: nor &s;hall we now hear
of &s;o many helple&s;s babes birth-&s;trangled in a nece&s;&s;ary, or
&s;mothered by the ditch-delivered drab. As a ba&s;tard is accounted in law,
<HI>qua&s;i nullius filius,</HI> the child of no|body, and related to nobody,
and yet is ble&s;t with as fair proportions, and capable of an equal degree of
per|fection with 
<Q REND="inline">"hone&s;t madam's i&s;&s;ue,"</Q> it is &s;urely
an act of great humanity thus to re&s;cue them from untimely deaths and other
mi&s;eries, which They do not merit, whatever may be the guilt of their
parents.</P>
<P>THOUGH it is obvious, that this Ho&s;pital will be made the
receptacle of many legitimate children, it is no le&s;s certain that the rich,
as well as the poor, will often &s;end their ba&s;e-born bantlings to this
general nur&s;ery. The wealthy man of quality, or &s;ub&s;tantial cit, may have
their private family-rea&s;ons for not owning the fruits of their &s;ecret
amours, and be glad to put the little living witne&s;s of their intrigues out
of the way. For this rea&s;on, an hi&s;tory of the Foundlings received there
would be very curious and entertaining, as it would contain many anec|dotes not
to be learned from any Pari&s;h Regi&s;ter. The reflections that pa&s;&s;ed in
my mind on this &s;ubject, gave occa&s;ion the other evening to the following
Dream.</P>
<P>Methought, as I was &s;tanding at the private door of the
Ho&s;pital, where a croud of females (each of them with a child in her arms)
were pre&s;&s;ing to get in, an elderly gentleman, whom from his white &s;taff
I took to <PB N="741" REF="316"> be a governour of the charity, very
courteou&s;ly invited me to come in. I accepted his offer; and having &s;eated
my&s;elf next him&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"Mr. TOWN, &s;ays he, I am con|&s;cious that you
look upon mo&s;t the&s;e little infants as the offsprings of &s;o many
unmarried fathers, and maiden-mothers, which have been clande&s;tinely
&s;muggled into the world. Know then that I am one of tho&s;e guar|dian Genii,
appointed to &s;uperintend the fortunes of Ba&s;tards: therefore, as this
Ho&s;pital is more immedi|ately under my tuition, I have put on this
di&s;gui&s;e; and, if you plea&s;e, will let you into the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of
tho&s;e babes, who are my wards, and their parents."</Q></P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured him, his intelligence would be highly agree|able;
and &s;everal now coming up to offer their children, he re&s;umed his
di&s;cour&s;e&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"Ob&s;erve, &s;aid he, that jolly little rogue,
with plump cheeks, a florid com|plexion, blue eyes, and &s;andy locks. We have
here already &s;everal of his brethren by the mother's &s;ide; &s;ome fair,
&s;ome brown, and &s;ome black: and yet they are all &s;uppo&s;ed to have come
by the &s;ame father. The mother has for many years been hou&s;ekeeper to a
gentleman who cannot &s;ee that her children bear the marks of his own
&s;ervants, and that this very brat is the exact re&s;emblance of his
coachman.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"THAT puling whining infant there, with a pale
face, emaciated body, and di&s;torted limbs, is the forced pro|duct of
viper-broth and cantharides. It is the offspring of a worn-out buck of quality,
who at the &s;ame time he debauched the mother, ruined her con&s;titution by a
filthy di&s;ea&s;e; in con&s;equence of which, &s;he with much 
<PB N="742" REF="317"> difficulty brought forth this ju&s;t picture of
him&s;elf in miniature.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"THE next that offers is the i&s;&s;ue of a
careful cit; who, as he keeps an hor&s;e for his own riding on &s;undays, which
he lets out all the re&s;t of the week, keeps al&s;o a mi&s;tre&s;s for his
recreation on the &s;eventh day, who lets her&s;elf out on all the other &s;ix.
That other babe owes his birth likewi&s;e to the city, but is the joint
product, as we may &s;ay, of two fathers; who being great oeconomi&s;ts in
their plea&s;ures as well as in their bu&s;ine&s;s, have &s;et up a whore and
an one hor&s;e-chai&s;e in partner&s;hip together.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"THAT pert young baggage there, who &s;o boldly
pre&s;&s;es forward with her brat, is not the mother of it, but is maid to a
&s;ingle lady of the &s;tricte&s;t honour and unblemi&s;hed reputation. About a
twelve month, ago her mi&s;tre&s;s went to <HI>Bath</HI> for the benefit of her
health; and ten months after, &s;he travelled into <HI>North Wales</HI> to
&s;ee a relation; from whence &s;he is ju&s;t returned. We may &s;uppo&s;e,
that &s;he took a fancy to that pretty babe while in the country, and brought
it up to town with her, in order to place it here; as &s;he did a few years ago
to another charming boy, which being too old to be got into this Ho&s;pital, is
now at a &s;chool in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> where young gentlemen are boarded,
cloath|ed, and educated, and found in all nece&s;&s;aries, for ten pounds a
year.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"THAT chubby little boy, which you &s;ee in the
arms of yonder &s;trapping wench in a camblet gown and red cloak, is her own
&s;on. She is by profe&s;&s;ion a bed-maker <PB N="743" REF="318"> in one of
the univer&s;ities, and of the &s;ame college, in which the father (a grave
tutor) holds a fellow&s;hip under the u&s;ual condition of not marrying. Many
&s;ober gentlemen of the cloth, who are in the &s;ame &s;crape, are glad to
take the benefit of this charity: And if all of the &s;ame reverend order, like
the prie&s;ts abroad, were laid under the &s;ame re&s;trictions, you might
expect to &s;ee a particular Ho&s;pital, erected for the reception of the Sons
of the Clergy.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"THAT next child belongs to a &s;ea-captain's
lady, who&s;e hu&s;band is expected to return every moment from a long voyage;
the fears of which have happily ha&s;tened the birth of this infant a full
month before its time. That other is the po&s;thumous child of a wealthy old
gentleman, who had married a young girl for love, and dyed in the honey-moon.
This his &s;on and heir was not born till near a twelve month after his
decea&s;e, becau&s;e its birth was retarded by the ex|ce&s;&s;ive grief of his
widow; who on that account ra|ther cho&s;e to lye-in privately, and to lodge
their only child here, than to have its legitimacy and her own honour called in
que&s;tion by her hu&s;band's relations."</Q></P>
<P>MY companion pointed out to me &s;everal others no le&s;s
extraordinary; among which I remember he told me, one was the unhallowed brood
of a Methodi&s;t teacher, and another the premature &s;pawn of a Maid of
honour. A poor author ea&s;ed him&s;elf of a very heavy load of two
twin-daughters, which in an evil hour he begot on an hawker of pamphlets, after
he had been writing a lu&s;cious novel: but I could not help &s;miling at the
marks &s;ent in with the&s;e new Mu&s;es, &s;ignifying, that one had been 
<PB N="744" REF="319"> chri&s;tened <HI>Terp&s;ichore,</HI> and the other
<HI>Polyhymnia.</HI> Several bantlings were imported from <HI>I&s;lington,
Hoxton,</HI> and other villages within the &s;ound of <HI>Bow Bell:</HI> many
were tran&s;planted hither out of the country; and a whole litter of brats were
&s;ent in from two or three pari&s;hes in particular, for which it is doubtful
whether they were mo&s;t indebted, to the par&s;on or the &s;quire.</P>
<P>A mode&s;t-looking woman now brought a very fine babe to be
admitted; but the governors rejected it, as it appeared to be above two months
old. The mother on the contrary per&s;i&s;ted in affirming, that it was but
ju&s;t born, and addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to me, de&s;ired me to look at it. I
accordingly took it in my arms; and while I was to&s;&s;ing it up and down, and
prai&s;ing its beauty, the &s;ly hu&s;&s;y contrived to &s;lip away, leaving
the precious charge to my care. The efforts which I made to bawl after her, and
the &s;qualling of the brat which rung pite|ou&s;ly in my ears, luckily awaked
me; and I was very happy to find, that I had only been dandling my pillow
in&s;tead of a bantling.</P>

<P>_ALMOST every man is or has been, or at lea&s;t thinks that he
is or has been a Lover. One has fought for his mi&s;tre&s;s, another has drank
for her, another wrote for her, and another has done all three: and yet perhaps
in &s;pite of their duels, poetry, and bumpers, not one of them ever
entertained a &s;incere pa&s;&s;ion. I have lately taken a &s;urvey of the
numerous tribe of <HI>Enamoratos,</HI> and after having ob&s;erved the various
&s;hapes they wear, think I <PB N="746" REF="321"> may &s;afely pronounce, that
though all profe&s;s to have been in Love, there are very few who are really
capable of it.</P>
<P>IT is a maxim of <HI>Rochefoucault</HI>'s, that, 
<Q REND="inline">"many men would never have been in Love, if they
had never heard of Love."</Q> The ju&s;tice of this remark is equal to its
&s;hrewdne&s;s. The ridiculous prate of a family has frequently great influence
on young minds, who learn to Love, as they do every thing el&s;e, by imitation.
Young crea|tures, almo&s;t mere children, have been con&s;umed with this
&s;econd-hand flame lighted up at another's pa&s;&s;ion; and in con&s;equence
of the loves of the footman and chambermaid, I have known little ma&s;ter fancy
him&s;elf a dying &s;wain at the age of thirteen, and little mi&s;s pining away
with Love in a bib and hanging &s;leeves.</P>
<P>THAT va&s;t heap of volumes, filled with Love, and &s;uffi|cient
in number to make a library, are great inflamers, and &s;eldom fail to produce
that kind of pa&s;&s;ion de&s;cribed by <HI>Rochefoucault.</HI> The chief of
the&s;e literary &s;educers are the old romances, and their degenerate &s;pawn,
the modern no|vels. The young &s;tudent reads of the emotions of Love, till he
imagines that he feels them throbbing and fluttering in his little brea&s;t; as
valetudinarians &s;tudy the hi&s;tory of a di&s;ea&s;e, till they fancy
them&s;elves affected with every &s;ymp|tom of it. For this rea&s;on, I am
always &s;orry to &s;ee any of this tra&s;h in the hands of young people: I
look upon <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra</HI> and <HI>Cleopatra</HI> as well as <HI>Betty
Barnes, Polly Willis,</HI> &amp;c. as no better than bawds; and con&s;ider Don
<HI>Bellianis</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> and Sir <HI>Amadis de Gaul,</HI> with
<HI>George Edwards, Loveill,</HI> &amp;c. as arrant pimps. But though romances
and novels are both equally &s;timulatives, yet their operations are very
different. <PB N="747" REF="322"> The romance-&s;tudent becomes a fond
<HI>Corydon</HI> of <HI>Sicily,</HI> or a very <HI>Damon</HI> of
<HI>Arcadia,</HI> and is in good truth &s;uch a dying &s;wain, that he believes
he &s;hall hang him&s;elf on the next willow, or drown him&s;elf in the next
pond, if he &s;hould lo&s;e the object of his wi&s;hes: but the young
noveli&s;t turns out more a man of the world, and after having gained the
affections of his mi&s;tre&s;s, forms a hundred &s;chemes to &s;ecure the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her, and to bam her relations.</P>
<P>THERE are, among the tribe of Lovers, a &s;ort of luke|warm
gentlemen, who can hardly be &s;aid, in the language of Love, to entertain a
<HI>flame</HI> for their mi&s;tre&s;s. The&s;e are your men of &s;uperlative
delicacy and refinement, who loath the gro&s;s ideas annexed to the amours of
the vulgar, and aim at &s;omething more &s;piritualized and &s;ublime. The&s;e
philo&s;ophers in Love doat on the mind alone of their mi&s;tre&s;s, and would
fain &s;ee her naked &s;oul, diverted of its material incumbrances. Gentlemen
of this complexion might per|haps not improperly be ranged in the romantic
cla&s;s, but they have a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the name of <HI>Platonic
Lovers.</HI></P>
<P>PLATONISM, however, is in the&s;e days very &s;carce; and there
is another cla&s;s, infinitely more numerous, compo&s;ed of a &s;ort of Lovers,
whom we may ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;h by the title of <HI>Epicureans.</HI> The
principles of this &s;ect are diametri|cally oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of the
<HI>Platonics.</HI> They think no more of the &s;oul of their mi&s;tre&s;s,
than a mu&s;&s;ulman, but are in raptures with her per&s;on. A Lover of this
&s;ort is in perpetual exta&s;ies: his pa&s;&s;ion is &s;o violent that he even
&s;corches you with his flame; and he runs over the perfec|tions of his
mi&s;tre&s;s in the &s;ame &s;tile that a jockey prai&s;es his 
<PB N="748" REF="323"> hor&s;e. 
<Q REND="inline">"Such limbs! &s;uch eyes! &s;uch a neck and
brea&s;t! &s;uch&mdash;oh, &s;he's a rare piece."</Q> Their ideas go no farther
than mere external accompli&s;hments; and as their wounds may be &s;aid to be
only &s;kin deep, we cannot allow their brea&s;ts to be &s;mitten with Love,
though perhaps they may rankle with a much gro&s;&s;er pa&s;&s;ion. Yet it
mu&s;t be owned that nothing is more common, than for gentlemen of this ca&s;t
to be involved in what is called a Love-match: but then it is owing to the
&s;ame cau&s;e with the marriage of Sir <HI>John Brute,</HI> who &s;ays, 
<Q REND="inline">"I married my wife, becau&s;e I wanted to lie
with her, and &s;he would not let me."</Q></P>
<P>OTHER gentlemen of a gay di&s;po&s;ition and warm
con&s;ti|tution, who go in the catalogue for Lovers, are adorers of almo&s;t
every woman they &s;ee. The flame of Love is as ea&s;ily kindled in them, as
the &s;parks are &s;truck out of a flint, and it al&s;o expires as &s;oon. A
Lover of this &s;ort dances one day with a lady at a ball, and lo&s;es his
heart to her in a minuet; the next another carries it off in the mall; and the
next day perhaps he goes out of town, and lodges it in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of all the country beauties &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, till at la&s;t he brings it
back to town with him, and pre&s;ents it to the fir&s;t woman he meets. This
cla&s;s is very numerous; but ought by no means to hold a place among the tribe
of true Lovers, &s;ince a gentleman who is thus in Love with every body, may
fairly be &s;aid not to be in Love at all.</P>
<P>LOVE is univer&s;ally allowed to be whim&s;ical; and if whim is
the e&s;&s;ence of Love, none can be accounted truer Lovers, than tho&s;e who
admire their mi&s;tre&s;s for &s;ome particular charm, which enchains them,
though it would &s;ingly never captivate any body el&s;e. Some gentlemen have
been won <PB N="749" REF="324"> to conjugal embraces by a pair of fine arms;
others have been held fa&s;t by an even white &s;et of teeth; and I know a very
good &s;cholar, who was en&s;nared by a &s;et of golden tre&s;&s;es, becau&s;e
it was the ta&s;te of the antients, and the true cla&s;&s;ical hair. Tho&s;e
ladies, who&s;e lovers are &s;uch piecemeal admirers, are in perpetual danger
of lo&s;ing them. A ra&s;h, or a pimple may abate their affection: All tho&s;e,
the object of who&s;e adoration is merely a pretty face or a fine per&s;on, are
in the power of the like accidents; and the &s;mall pox has occa&s;ioned many a
poor lady the lo&s;s of her beauty and her Lover at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>BUT after all the&s;e &s;purious <HI>Enamoratos,</HI> there are
&s;ome few, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion is &s;incere and well-founded. True, ge|nuine
Love is always built upon e&s;teem: not that I would mean that a man can
rea&s;on and argue him&s;elf into Love; but that a con&s;tant intercour&s;e
with an amiable woman will lead him into a contemplation of her excellent
qualities, which will in&s;en&s;ibly win his heart before he is him&s;elf aware
of it, and beget all tho&s;e hopes, fears, and other extrava|gances, which are
the natural attendants on a true pa&s;&s;ion. Love has been de&s;cribed ten
thou&s;and times: but that I may be &s;ure that the little picture I would draw
of it is taken from nature, I will conclude this paper with the &s;tory of
hone&s;t WILL EASY and his amiable wife. WILL EASY and Mi&s;s &mdash; became
very early acquainted, and from being familiarly intimate with the whole
family, WILL might be almo&s;t &s;aid to live there. He dined and &s;upped with
them perpetually in town, and &s;pent great part of the &s;ummer with them at
their &s;eat in the country. WILL and the lady were both univer&s;ally allowed
to have &s;en&s;e, and their fre|quent conver&s;ations together gave them
undoubted proofs of <PB N="750" REF="325"> the goodne&s;s of each other's
di&s;po&s;ition. They delighted in the company, and admired the perfections of
each other, and gave a thou&s;and little indications of a growing pa&s;&s;ion,
not unob&s;erved by others, even while it was yet unknown and un&s;u&s;pected
even by them&s;elves. However, after &s;ome time WILL, by mutual agreement,
demanded the lady of her father in marriage. But alas! 
<Q REND="inline">"the cour&s;e of true Love never yet run
&s;mooth:"</Q> the ill-judged ambition of a parent induced the father, out of
mere love to his daugh|ter, to refu&s;e her hand to the only man in the world
with whom &s;he could live happily, becau&s;e he imagined that he might in the
<HI>Smithfield</HI> phra&s;e, do <HI>better</HI> for her. But Love, grounded on
ju&s;t principles, is not ea&s;ily &s;haken; and as it appeared that their
mutual pa&s;&s;ion had taken too deep root ever to be extirpated; the father at
la&s;t reluctantly half-con&s;ented to their union. They enjoy a genteel
competency, and WILL by his integrity and abilities is an honour to a learned
profe&s;&s;ion, and a ble&s;&s;ing to his wife; who&s;e greate&s;t prai&s;e is,
that her virtues de&s;erve &s;uch an hu&s;band. She is plea&s;ed with having 
<Q REND="inline">"left dro&s;s to duche&s;&s;es."</Q> He
con&s;iders her happine&s;s as his main in|tere&s;t, and their example every
day gives fre&s;h conviction to the father, that where two per&s;ons of
&s;trong &s;en&s;e and good hearts, conceive a reciprocal affection for each
other, their pa&s;&s;ion is genuine and la&s;ting, and their union is perhaps
the true&s;t &s;tate of happine&s;s under the &s;un.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR E&s;&s;ay on the abu&s;e of words was very well received
here, but more e&s;pecially that part of it, which contained the modern
definition of the word RUINED. You mu&s;t know, Sir, that in the language of
our old Dons, every young man is <HI>ruined,</HI> who is not an arrant
<HI>Tycho Brahe,</HI> or <HI>Erra Pater.</HI> Yet it is re|markable, that
though the &s;ervants of the Mu&s;es meet with more than ordinary
di&s;couragement at this place, yet <HI>Cambridge</HI> has produced many
celebrated poets: witne&s;s <HI>Spen&s;er, Milton, Cowley, Dryden,</HI> &amp;c.
not to men|tion &s;ome admired writers of the pre&s;ent times. I my|&s;elf,
Sir, am grievou&s;ly &s;u&s;pected of being better ac|quainted with
<HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> than <HI>Euclid</HI> or
<HI>Sander|&s;on;</HI> and am univer&s;ally agreed to be <HI>ruined</HI> for
having concerned my&s;elf with Hexameter and Pentameter more than Diameter. The
equity of this deci&s;ion I &s;hall not <PB N="755" REF="330"> di&s;pute, but
content my&s;elf at pre&s;ent with &s;ubmitting to the publick, by means of
your paper, the following lines on the import of another favourite word,
occa&s;ioned by the e&s;&s;ay above mentioned.</P>
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>WORDS are, &s;o <HI>Wolla&s;ton</HI> defines,</L>
<L>Of our ideas merely &s;igns,</L>
<L>Which have a pow'r at will to vary,</L>
<L>As being vague and arbitrary.</L>
<L>Now <HI>damn'd,</HI> for in&s;tance&mdash;All agree</L>
<L><HI>Damn'd</HI>'s the <HI>&s;uperlative Degree</HI>;</L>
<L>Means <HI>that</HI> alone, and nothing more,</L>
<L>However taken heretofore.</L>
<L><HI>Damn'd</HI> is a word can't &s;tand alone,</L>
<L>Which has no meaning of its own;</L>
<L>But &s;ignifies or bad or good,</L>
<L>Ju&s;t as its neighbour's under&s;tood.</L>
<L>Examples we may find enough,</L>
<L><HI>Damn'd</HI> high, <HI>damn'd</HI> low, <HI>damn'd</HI>
fire, <HI>damn'd</HI> &s;tuff.</L>
<L>So fares it too with its relation,</L>
<L>I mean its &s;ub&s;tantive <HI>damnation.</HI></L>
<L>The wit with metaphors makes bold,</L>
<L>And tells you he's <HI>damnation</HI> cold:</L>
<L>Perhaps, that metaphor forgot,</L>
<L>The &s;elf-&s;ame wit's <HI>damnation</HI> hot.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>AND here a fable I remember&mdash;</L>
<L>Once in the middle of <HI>December,</HI></L>
<L>When ev'ry mead in &s;now was lo&s;t,</L>
<L>And ev'ry river bound with fro&s;t,</L>

<L>When&mdash;pox of the de&s;criptive rhime&mdash;</L>
<L>In &s;hort, it was the winter time.</L>
<L>It was a pedlar's happy lot</L>
<L>To fall into a <HI>Satyr</HI>'s cot:</L>
<L>Shiv'ring with cold and almo&s;t froze,</L>
<L>With pearly drop upon his no&s;e,</L>
<L>His fingers ends all pinch'd to death,</L>
<L>He blew upon them with his breath.</L>
<L><PB N="756" REF="331">Friend, quoth the <HI>Satyr,</HI>
what intends</L>
<L>That blowing on thy fingers ends?</L>
<L>"It is to warm them, thus I blow,</L>
<L>"For they are froze as cold as &s;now;</L>
<L>"And &s;o inclement has it been,</L>
<L>"I'm like a cake of ice within."</L>
<L>Come, quoth the <HI>Satyr,</HI> comfort, then!</L>
<L>I'll chear thy in&s;ide, if I can;</L>

<LG>
<L>THIS &s;aid, the <HI>Satyr</HI> nothing loth</L>

<L>What can be done?&mdash;with gentle puff</L>

<P>_I Remember a rector of a pari&s;h at the court end of the town,
who was gene|rally accounted a very fine preacher, that u&s;ed to aim at
delivering him&s;elf in the mo&s;t bold and animated &s;tile of oratory. The
tone of his voice was nicely accommodated to the different branches of his
di&s;|cour&s;e, and every thing was pronounced with uncommon energy and
empha&s;is; he al&s;o indulged him&s;elf in equal freedom of action, and
abounded in various extraordi|nary ge&s;ticulations; his &s;ermons them&s;elves
were &s;own thick with tropes, metaphors, and &s;imilies, and every where
enriched with <HI>apo&s;trophe</HI> and <HI>pro&s;opopaeia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="758" REF="333">AS I knew that this reverend gentleman had
been abroad with a young nobleman in the capacity of a tra|velling tutor, I did
not wonder at the violent exertion of his voice, and the vehemence of his
action; as this is a piece of clerical foppery, which an itinerant clergyman is
apt to adopt, while his pupil is gleaning all the other follies of
<HI>Paris:</HI> at which place it is very common to &s;ee a <HI>capuchine</HI>
&s;o heated with his &s;ubject, that he often &s;eems in danger of throwing
him&s;elf out of the pulpit. But I was at a lo&s;s how to account for the
glowing &s;tile of his di&s;cour&s;es, till happening to turn over the works of
a celebrated <HI>French</HI> preacher, I found that the oratorical performances
of my friend were no other than faithful tran&s;lations of them.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ort of pulpit plagiari&s;m may perhaps be more adapted
to the ta&s;te of &s;ome of our fa&s;hionable de|claimers, than the more
hackneyed method of tran|&s;cribing a page from <HI>Barrow, Tillot&s;on,</HI>
or <HI>Atterbury:</HI> but although &s;uch practices may be le&s;s liable to
de|tection, it is certainly more orthodox to rifle the works of our own
Divines, than to ran&s;ack the trea&s;ures of <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> prie&s;ts; and
their inflamed orations are undoubt|edly le&s;s adapted to the genius of our
people, than the &s;ober rea&s;onings of our own preachers. It mu&s;t be owned
indeed that &s;ome of our clergy are greatly want|ing in that life and
&s;pirit, which would render their in&s;tructions more affecting as well as
more plea&s;ing. Their &s;ermons are frequently drawn out in one continued
drawl, without any variation of voice or ge&s;ture: &s;o that it is no wonder,
if &s;ome of the congregation &s;hould be caught napping, when the preacher
him&s;elf hardly <PB N="759" REF="334"> &s;eems to be awake. But though this
drow&s;y delivery is not to be commended, yet a &s;erious earne&s;tne&s;s is
mo&s;t likely to engage the attention, and convince the rea&s;on. This manner,
as it is mo&s;t decent in it&s;elf, is be&s;t &s;uited to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
audience; though it is no wonder that a different &s;train of oratory &s;hould
prevail in <HI>France,</HI> &s;ince a <HI>Frenchman</HI> accompanies almo&s;t
every word in ordinary conver&s;ation with &s;ome fanta&s;tic ge&s;ture, and
even enquires concerning your health, and talks of the weather, with a
thou&s;and &s;hrugs and grimaces.</P>
<P>BUT though I do not like to &s;ee a preacher lazily lolling on
the cu&s;hion, or dozing over his &s;ermon-ca&s;e, and haranguing his audience
with an unchri&s;tian apathy; yet even this unanimated delivery is perhaps
le&s;s offen&s;ive, than to ob&s;erve a clergyman le&s;s a&s;&s;iduous to
in&s;truct his audience, than to be admired by them. A &s;ober divine &s;hould
not a&s;cend the pulpit with the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions that a public orator
mounts the <HI>ro&s;trum:</HI> much le&s;s &s;hould he a&s;&s;ume the voice,
ge&s;ture, and de|portment of a player, and the language of the theatre. He
&s;hould pre&s;erve a temperance in the mo&s;t earne&s;t parts of his
di&s;cour&s;e, and go through the whole of it in &s;uch a manner, as be&s;t
agrees with the &s;olemn place in which it is uttered. Pompous non&s;en&s;e,
bellowed out with a thundering accent, comes with a wor&s;e grace from the
pulpit, than bomba&s;t and &s;u&s;tian injudiciou&s;ly ranted forth by a 
<Q REND="inline">"periwig-pated fellow"</Q> on the &s;tage. I
can|not better illu&s;trate the ab&s;urdity and indecency of this manner, than
by a familiar, though &s;hameful, in&s;tance of it. Whoever has occa&s;ionally
joined with the butchers in making up the audience of the <HI>Clare-Market</HI>
<PB N="760" REF="335"> Orator will agree with me, that the impropriety of his
&s;tile and the extravagance of his action become &s;till more &s;hocking and
intolerable by the day which they pro|phane, and the eccle&s;ia&s;tical
appearance of the place in which the declaimer harangues. Thus while tho&s;e
who thunder out damnation from pari&s;h pulpits, may, from a&s;&s;uming the
manners of the theatre, be re&s;embled to ranting players; the
<HI>Clare-Market</HI> Orator, while he turns religion into farce, mu&s;t be
con&s;idered as exhibiting &s;hews and interludes of an inferior nature, and
him&s;elf regarded as a Jack-pudding in a gown and ca&s;&s;ock.</P>
<P>A BLOATED &s;tile is perhaps of all others lea&s;t to be
commended. It is more frequently made a &s;helter for non&s;en&s;e, than a
vehicle of truth: but though improper on all occa&s;ions, it more especially
deviates from the cha&s;te plainne&s;s and &s;implicity of Pulpit Eloquence.
Nor am I le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ed with tho&s;e who are admired by &s;ome as
<HI>pretty</HI> preachers; as I think a clergyman may be a coxcomb in his
&s;tile and manner, as well as a prig in his appearance. Flowers of rhetoric
injudiciou&s;ly &s;cattered over a &s;ermon are as di&s;gu&s;ting in his
di&s;cour&s;e, as the &s;nug wig and &s;cented white handkerchief in his
dre&s;s. The <HI>pretty</HI> preacher aims al&s;o at politene&s;s and
good-breeding, takes the ladies to ta&s;k in a genteel vein of raillery, and
handles their modi&s;h foibles with the &s;ame air that he gallants their fans:
but if he has a mind to put his abili|ties to the &s;tretch, and indulge
him&s;elf in a more than ordinary flow of rhetoric, he fritters away the
&s;olemnity of &s;ome &s;criptural &s;ubject; and I have heard a flourishing
declaimer of this ca&s;t take off from the awful idea of the Pa&s;&s;ion by
dwelling principally on the gracefulne&s;s of per&s;on, &s;weetne&s;s of voice,
and elegance of deportment <PB N="761" REF="336"> in the Divine Sufferer; and
at another time in &s;peaking of the Fall, I have known him enter into a
picture&s;que de&s;cription of the woods, groves, and rivulets, pan&s;ies,
pinks, and violets, that threw a perpetual gaiety over the face of nature in
the garden of <HI>Eden.</HI></P>
<P>AFFECTED oratory and an extravagant delivery were fir&s;t
practi&s;ed by tho&s;e who vary from the regular e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church: nor
is there any manner &s;o unbecoming and indecent, which has not at one time or
another been accounted truly &s;piritual and graceful. Snuffling through the
no&s;e with an harmonious twang has been regarded as a kind of church-mu&s;ic
be&s;t calculated to rai&s;e devo|tion, and a piteous chorus of &s;ighs and
groans has been thought the mo&s;t effectual call to repentance. Irregular
tremblings of the voice and contortions of the per&s;on have long been the
eloquence of Quakers and Pre&s;byterians; and are now the favourite mode of
preaching practi&s;ed by tho&s;e &s;elf-ordained teachers, who &s;trike out new
lights in religion, and pour forth their extempore rhap&s;odies in a torrent of
enthu&s;ia&s;tical oratory. An in&s;pired cobler will thunder out anathemas,
with the tone and ge&s;ture of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> from a joint-&s;tool; and an
enlightened brick|layer will work him&s;elf up to &s;uch a pitch of vehemence,
as &s;hall make his audience quake again. I am &s;orry to &s;ee our regular
divines rather copying than reforming this hot and extravagant manner of
preaching; and have with pain been witne&s;s to a wild intemperate delivery in
our pari&s;h-churches, which I &s;hould only have expected at the chapel in
<HI>Long-Acre,</HI> or at the Foundery and Ta|bernacle in
<HI>Moor-Fields.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="762" REF="337">AS a &s;erious earne&s;tne&s;s in the
delivery, and a nervous &s;implicity in the &s;tile of a di&s;cour&s;e, are the
mo&s;t becom|ing ornaments of the pulpit, &s;o an affectation of elo|quence is
no where &s;o offen&s;ive. The delivery of a preacher as well as his diction
&s;hould, like his dre&s;s, be plain and decent. Inflamed eloquence and wild
ge&s;tures are un&s;uitable to the place and his function; and though &s;uch
vehement heat may perhaps kindle the zeal of a few enthu&s;ia&s;tic old beldams
in the i&s;le, it has a very dif|ferent effect on the more rational part of the
congrega|tion. I would therefore recommend it to our fa&s;hion|able divines to
aim at being Preachers rather than Orators or Actors, and to endeavour to make
their di&s;cour&s;es ap|pear like Sermons rather than Orations.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WE are told, that in <HI>Spain</HI> it is the cu&s;tom for
hu&s;bands never to let their wives go abroad without a watchful old woman to
attend them; and in <HI>Turkey</HI> it is the fa&s;hion to lock up their
mi&s;tre&s;&s;es under the guard of a tru&s;ty eunuch: but I never knew, that
in any country the men were put under the &s;ame re&s;trictions. Alas! Sir, my
wife is to me a very <HI>Duena;</HI> &s;he is as careful of me, as the
<HI>Kei&s;ler Aga,</HI> or Chief Eunuch, is of the Grand Signior's favourite
Sultana: <PB N="764" REF="339"> and whether &s;he believes, that I am in love
with every woman, or that every woman is in love with me, &s;he will never
tru&s;t me out of her &s;ight; but &s;ticks as clo&s;e to me, as if &s;he
really was, without a figure, bone of my bone, and fle&s;h of my fle&s;h. I am
never &s;uffered to &s;tir abroad without her, le&s;t I &s;hould go a&s;tray;
and at home &s;he follows me up and down the hou&s;e like a child in
leading-&s;trings: nay, if I do but &s;tep down &s;tairs on any ordinary
occa&s;ion, &s;he is &s;o afraid I &s;hall give her the &s;lip, that &s;he
always &s;creams after me, 
<Q REND="inline">"my dear, you are not going out;"</Q> though
for better &s;ecurity &s;he generally locks up my hat and cane together with
her own gloves and cardinal, that one might not &s;tir out without the
other.</P>
<P>I CANNOT flatter my&s;elf, that I am hand&s;omer or better
made than other men: nor has &s;he, in my eyes at lea&s;t, fewer charms than
other women. Need I add, that my complexion is not over-&s;anguine, nor my
con&s;titution very robu&s;t? Be&s;ides, we have not been married above a
month. And yet &s;he is &s;o very doubtful of my con|&s;tancy, that I cannot
&s;peak, or even pay the compliment of my hat, to any young lady, though in
public, without giving new alarms to her jealou&s;y. Such an one, &s;he is
&s;ure from her flaunting airs, is a kept madam; another is no better than
&s;he &s;hould be; and &s;he &s;aw another tip me the wink, or give me a nod,
as a mark of &s;ome private a&s;&s;ignation between us. A nun, Sir, might as
&s;oon force her way into a convent of monks, as any young woman get admittance
into our hou&s;e: &s;he has therefore affronted all her acquaintance of her own
&s;ex, that are not, or might not have been, the grandmothers 
<PB N="765" REF="340"> of many generations; and is at home to nobody, but
maiden ladies in the bloom of three&s;core, and beauties of the la&s;t
century.</P>
<P>SHE will &s;carce allow me to mix even with per&s;ons of my
own &s;ex; and &s;he looks upon batchelors in particular, as no better than
pimps and common &s;educers. One evening &s;he, indeed, vouch&s;afed to tru&s;t
me out of doors at a tavern with &s;ome of my male-friends: but the fir&s;t
bottle had &s;carce gone round, before word was brought up, that my boy was
come with the lanthorn to light me home. I &s;ent him back with orders to call
in an hour; when pre&s;ently after the maid was di&s;patched, with no|tice that
my dear was gone to bed very ill, and wanted me directly. I was preparing to
obey the &s;ummons; when to our great &s;urprize the &s;ick lady her&s;elf
bolted into the room, complained of my cruel heart, and fell into a fit, from
which &s;he did not recover, till the coach had &s;et us down at our own
hou&s;e. She then called me the ba|&s;e&s;t of hu&s;bands, and &s;aid that all
taverns were no better than bawdy-hou&s;es, and that men only went thither to
meet naughty women: at la&s;t &s;he declared it to be her firm re&s;olution,
that I &s;hould never &s;et my foot again in any one of them, except her&s;elf
be allowed to make one of the company.</P>
<P>YOU will &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, that while my wife is thus cautious
that I &s;hould not be led a&s;tray when abroad, &s;he takes particular care
that I &s;hould not &s;tumble on tempta|tions at home. For this rea&s;on, as
&s;oon as I had brought her to my hou&s;e, my two maid-&s;ervants were
imme|diately turned away at a moment's warning, not with|out 
<PB N="766" REF="341"> out many covert hints and &s;ome open accu&s;ations of
too near an intimacy between us: though I prote&s;t to you one was a feeble old
wrinkled creature, as haggard and frightful as mother <HI>Shipton</HI>; and the
other, a &s;trapping wench, as coar&s;e and brawny as the Female
<HI>Sam&s;on.</HI> Even my man <HI>John,</HI> who had lived in the family for
thir|ty years, was packed off, as being too well acquainted with his ma&s;ter's
&s;ly ways. A chair-woman was forced to do our work for &s;ome time, before
madam could &s;uit her&s;elf with maids for her purpo&s;e. One was too pert an
hu&s;&s;y; another went too fine; another was an impudent forward young
baggage. At pre&s;ent our hou&s;ehold is made up of &s;uch beautiful
mon&s;ters, as <HI>Caliban</HI> him&s;elf might fall in love with: my lady's
own waiting-woman has a mo&s;t inviting hump-back, and is &s;o charmingly
pa|ralytic, that &s;he &s;hakes all over like a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> figure; the
hou&s;e-maid &s;quints mo&s;t delightfully with one &s;oli|tary eye, which
weeps continually for the lo&s;s of its fel|low; and the cook, be&s;ides a
mo&s;t captivating red face and protuberant wai&s;t, has a mo&s;t graceful
hobble in her gait, occa&s;ioned by one leg being &s;horter than the other.</P>
<P>I NEED not tell you, that I mu&s;t never write a letter, but
madam mu&s;t &s;ee the contents before it is done up; and that I never dur&s;t
open one till &s;he has broke the &s;eal, or read it till &s;he has fir&s;t run
it over. Every rap from the po&s;t-man at the door makes her tremble; and I
have known her ready to bur&s;t with &s;pleen at &s;eeing a &s;uper&s;cription
written in a fair <HI>Italian</HI> hand, though perhaps it only comes from my
aunt in the country. She can pick out an intrigue even from the impre&s;&s;ion
on the wax: and a cupid, or two hearts joined <PB N="767" REF="342"> in union,
or a wafer pricked with a pin, or &s;tamped with a thimble, &s;he interprets as
the certain tokens of a billet|doux. The other week I received a letter from
<HI>Derby-&s;hire,</HI> which awakened all her mi&s;tru&s;t. She knew from the
&s;crawl and &s;trange &s;pelling on the out&s;ide, that it mu&s;t come from a
woman: &s;he therefore tore it open in a violent rage, in hopes of making a
mo&s;t ma|terial di&s;covery; but to her great di&s;appointment the con|tents
were perfectly illegible. She was now convinced that it came from &s;ome
na&s;ty creature, whom I maintained in the country; and that we corre&s;ponded
together in cypher. I was obliged to confe&s;s the truth; that it was, indeed,
drawn up in cypher, and that I had the key to it. At length, with much ado, I
explained the whole matter to her; telling her, that it was a letter from my
farmer, who not having been bred at a writing-&s;chool expre&s;&s;ed his
meaning by characters of his own invention. However, this a&s;&s;urance did not
at all pacify her, till &s;he had di&s;patched a tru&s;ty me&s;&s;enger to be
certified of the truth.</P>
<P>THIS loving creature happened to be taken ill lately, when
&s;he thought that &s;he was going to die. She called me to her bed-&s;ide, and
with tears in her eyes told me, that &s;he &s;hould not be able to die in
peace, except I would promi&s;e her one thing. I a&s;&s;ured her, I would
promi&s;e any thing to make her ea&s;y&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"O my dear, &s;ays &s;he, I cannot bear the
thought of your being another's; and therefore I &s;hall not re&s;t in my
grave, if you do not &s;wear to me, that you will never marry again, or think
of another woman, as long as you <PB N="768" REF="343"> live."</Q> My poor dear
is, however, recovered, with|out putting my faith to &s;o hard a trial: though
I may venture to &s;ay, that I have already had &s;o much of matrimony, I could
&s;ubmit to any conditions to part with her.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_MY wife is mad, &s;tark mad; and unle&s;s you can pre&s;cribe
&s;ome remedy for that &s;trange phrenzy that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es her, my peace
of mind mu&s;t be for ever broken, and my fortune in|evitably ruined. You
mu&s;t know, &s;ir, that &s;he is afflicted with a di&s;order exactly
oppo&s;ite to the bite of a <HI>Tarantula:</HI> for as that is &s;aid to admit
of no cure but mu&s;ic, there is not a note in the <HI>Gamut,</HI> but what
tends to heighten and inflame my wife's lunacy. I find it is the fa&s;hion in
this age for &s;ingers and fidlers to publi&s;h Appeals to the public:
wherefore, as you have hitherto li&s;tened to the complaints of hu&s;bands, I
mu&s;t beg you now to con&s;ider <PB N="770" REF="345"> mine, and to &s;uffer
me al&s;o to Appeal to the public by means of your paper.</P>
<P>A FEW years ago bu&s;ine&s;s called me over to <HI>Italy</HI>;
where this unfortunate woman received the fir&s;t, touches of this di&s;order.
She &s;oon conceived a violent pa&s;&s;ion for Ta&s;te in general, which
&s;ettled at la&s;t in an unquenchable rage after mu&s;ical compo&s;itions.
Solos, Sonatas, Operas, and Con|certos, became her &s;ole employment and
delight, and &s;ingers and mu&s;icians her only company. At length full of
<HI>Italian</HI> airs &s;he returned to <HI>England,</HI> where al&s;o her
whole happine&s;s has been centered in the orche&s;tra, and it has been her
whole pride to be thought a <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur</HI> in mu&s;ic. If there is an
opera, oratorio, or concert, to be performed within the bills of mortality, I
do not believe that the riches of the <HI>Indies</HI> could prevail on her to
be ab&s;ent. Two, and only two good con&s;equences attend this madne&s;s, and
tho&s;e are, that &s;he con&s;tantly attends St. <HI>James</HI>'s chapel for
the &s;ake of the anthem and the re&s;t of the mu&s;ic: and out of the many
pounds idly &s;quandered on minums and &s;emi|quavers, &s;ome few are dedicated
to charities, which are pro|moted by mu&s;ical performances.</P>
<P>BUT what makes this rage after catgut more irk&s;ome and
intolerable to me is, that I have not my&s;elf the lea&s;t idea of what they
call Ta&s;te, and it almo&s;t drives me mad to be pe&s;tered with it. I am a
plain man, and have not the lea&s;t &s;pice of a <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur</HI> in my
compo&s;ition, yet nothing will &s;atisfy my wife unle&s;s I appear as fond of
&s;uch non&s;en&s;e as her&s;elf. About a month ago &s;he prevailed on me to
attend her to the Opera, where every dying fall made her expire, as well as
Lady <HI>Townly.</HI> She was ravi&s;hed with one air, in <PB N="771" REF="346"> exta&s;ies at another, applauded <HI>Ricciarelli,</HI> encored
<HI>Mingotti,</HI> and in &s;hort acted like an ab&s;olute madwoman; while the
performance and her behaviour had a quite different effect upon me, who &s;at
dumb with confu&s;ion, 
<Q REND="inline">"mo&s;t mu&s;ical, mo&s;t melancholy,"</Q> at
her elbow. When we came home again, &s;he &s;eemed as happy as harmony could
make her, but I mu&s;t own, that I was all di&s;cord, and mo&s;t heartily vexed
at being made a fool in public. 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, my dear, &s;aid &s;he, how do you like
the opera?"&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Zouns, madam, I would as &s;oon be dragged
through a hor&s;epond, as go to an opera with you again."&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"O fie! but you mu&s;t be delighted with
<HI>The Mingotti.</HI>"&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"The Mingotti! <HI>The Devil.</HI>"&mdash;</Q>

<Q REND="inline">"Well, I am &s;orry for it, Sir
<HI>Aaron,</HI> but I find you have no Ear."&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Ear, madam? I had rather cut off my ears,
than &s;uffer them to make me an ideot."</Q> To this &s;he made me no reply,
but began a favourite opera tune, and after taking a tour round the room like
one of the &s;ingers, left me alone.</P>
<P>IF my wife could be &s;atisfied, like other mu&s;ical ladies,
with attending public performances, and now and then thrumming on her
harp&s;icord the tunes &s;he hears there; I &s;hould be content. But &s;he has
al&s;o a concert of her own con&s;tantly once a week. Here &s;he is in &s;till
greater raptures than at the opera, as all the mu&s;ic is cho&s;en and
appointed by her&s;elf. The expence of this whim is mon&s;trous, for not one of
the&s;e people will open their mouths, or ro&s;in a &s;ingle &s;tring, without
being very well paid for it. Then &s;he mu&s;t have all the be&s;t hands and
voices, and has almo&s;t as large a &s;et of performers in pay as the manager
of the opera. It puts me quite out of patience to &s;ee the&s;e fellows
&s;trutting about my hou&s;e dre&s;t up like lords and gentlemen. Not a 
<PB N="772" REF="347"> &s;ingle fiddler or &s;inger but what appears in lace or
embroidery, and I once mi&s;took my wife's chief mu&s;i|cian for a foreign
amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to recount the numberle&s;s follies to
which this ridiculous pa&s;&s;ion for Mu&s;ic expo&s;es her. Her devotion to
the art, makes her almo&s;t adore the profe&s;&s;ors of it. A mu&s;ician is a
greater man in her eye than a duke, and &s;he would &s;ooner oblige an
opera-&s;inger than a counte&s;s. She is as bu&s;y in promoting their benefits
as if &s;he was to have the receipts of the hou&s;e; and quarrels with all her
ac|quaintance, who will not permit her to load them with tick|ets. Every fidler
in town makes it his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;crape an acquaintance with her, and an
<HI>Italian</HI> is no &s;ooner imported than &s;he becomes a part of my wife's
band of performers. In the late Opera di&s;putes &s;he has been a mo&s;t
furious parti|zan, and it is impo&s;&s;ible for any patriot to feel more
anxiety for the danger of <HI>Blakeney</HI> and <HI>Minorca,</HI> than &s;he
has &s;uffered on account of the Opera, and the lo&s;s of
<HI>Mingotti.</HI></P>
<P>I DO not believe my wife has a &s;ingle idea except
recita|tive, airs, counter-tenor, thorough-ba&s;s, &amp;c. which are
perpetually &s;inging in her head. When we &s;it together, in&s;tead of joining
in any agreeable conver&s;ation, &s;he is always either humming a tune, or 
<Q REND="inline">"di&s;cour&s;ing mo&s;t eloquent mu&s;ic."</Q>
Nature has denied her a voice, but as <HI>Italy</HI> has given her Ta&s;te and
a graceful manner, &s;he is continually &s;queaking out &s;trains le&s;s
melodious, than the harmony of ballad-&s;inging in our &s;treets, or
p&s;alm-&s;inging in a country church. To make her &s;till more ridiculous,
&s;he learns to play on that ma&s;culine in&s;trument the ba&s;s-viol; the
plea&s;ure of which nothing can prevail on her to forego, as the 
<PB N="773" REF="348"> ba&s;s-viol, &s;he daily tells me, contains the whole
power and very &s;oul of harmony.</P>
<P>WHAT method, Mr. TOWN, &s;hall I per&s;ue to cure my wife of
this mu&s;ical phrenzy? I have &s;ome thoughts of holding weekly a burle&s;que
<HI>Rorotorio,</HI> compo&s;ed of mock-airs with grand accompanyments of the
Jew's Harp, Wooden Spoons, and Marrowbones and Cleavers on the &s;ame day with
my wife's concert; and have actually &s;ent to two of Mrs. <HI>Midnight</HI>'s
hands to teach me the art and my&s;tery of playing on the Broom&s;tick and
Hurdy-Gurdy, at the &s;ame time that my wife learns on the ba&s;s-viol. I have
al&s;o a &s;trong rough voice, which will enable me to roar out <HI>Bumper</HI>
Squire Jones, <HI>Roa&s;t Beef,</HI> or &s;ome other old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
ballad, whenever &s;he begins to trill forth her melodious airs in
<HI>Italian.</HI> If this has no effect, I will learn to beat the drum, or wind
the po&s;t-horn: and if I &s;hould &s;till find it impo&s;&s;ible for noi&s;e
and clamour to overcome the &s;ound of her voices and in&s;truments, I have
half-re&s;olved peremptorily to &s;hut my doors again&s;t &s;ingers and
fidlers, and even to demoli&s;h her harp&s;ichord and ba&s;s-viol.</P>
<P>BUT this, alas! is coming to extremities, which I am almo&s;t
afraid to venture, and would endeavour to avoid. I have no aver&s;ion to
mu&s;ic, but I would not be a fidler: nor do I di&s;like company, but I would
as &s;oon keep an inn, as convert my hou&s;e into a theatre for all the idle
things of both &s;exes to a&s;&s;emble at. But my wife's affections are &s;o
wedded to the <HI>Gamut,</HI> that I cannot devi&s;e any means to wean her from
this folly. If I could make her fond of dre&s;s, or teach her to love cards,
plays, or any thing but mu&s;ic I &s;hould be happy. This method of
de&s;troying <PB N="774" REF="349"> my peace with harmony, is no better than
tickling me to death; and to &s;quander away &s;uch &s;ums of money on a parcel
of bawling &s;craping ra&s;cals in laced coats and bag-wigs, is ab&s;olutely
giving away my e&s;tate for an old &s;ong. You, Mr. TOWN, are a profe&s;&s;ed
<HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur,</HI> therefore either give me a little Ta&s;te, or teach
my wife to abandon it: for at pre&s;ent we are but a jangling pair, and there
is not the lea&s;t harmony between us, though, like ba&s;s and treble, we are
obliged to join in concert.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I AM a rich old bachelor, and like other an|tient gentlemen
of that order, and very fond of being indulged in all my odd humours, and
always having my own way. This is one rea&s;on I never married, for if my wife
had been a &s;hrewi&s;h termagant, &s;he would have killed me, and if &s;he had
been a tame dome&s;tic animal I &s;hould have killed her: but the way of life I
have now fallen into is of all others the be&s;t calculated to gratify my
fanta&s;tical temper. I have no near relation indeed to treat as an humble
cou&s;in all my life, in hopes of being happy at my death; yet I abound in
&s;ycophants and followers, all whom I delude, <PB N="776" REF="351"> like
another <HI>Volpone,</HI> with the expectations of being made my heir. The
abject &s;pirit of the&s;e wretches flatters me, and amu&s;es me. I am indolent
and hate contradiction, and can &s;afely &s;ay that not one of my acquaintance
has contra|dicted me for the&s;e &s;even years. There is not one of them but
would be glad if I would &s;pit in his face, or rejoice at a kick of the breech
from me, if they thought I meant it as a token of my familiarity. When I am
grave, they appear as dull as mutes at a funeral; when I &s;mile, they grin
like monkies; when I tell a &s;illy &s;tory, they chuckle over every ridiculous
particular, and &s;hake their &s;ides in admiration of my wit. Sometimes I
pretend to be &s;hort-&s;ighted, and then not one of them &s;ees farther than
his no&s;e. They &s;wallow &s;our wine, eat mu&s;ty victuals, and are proud to
ride in my old boots.</P>
<P>I HAVE been told of a certain prelate, who brought his
chaplains to &s;uch a degree of &s;ervility, that after every deal at whi&s;t,
they would a&s;k him, what he would chu&s;e to have for trumps next deal? I
keep my fellows in equal good order. They all think me a clo&s;e old hunks, and
imagining that winning their money will put me in good humour with them, they
practice all the arts of &s;harping to cheat them|&s;elves. I have known them
pack the cards at Whi&s;t, that I might hold all the four honours in my own
hand; they will load the dice in my favour at Hazard; pocket them&s;elves on
purpo&s;e at Billiards; and at Bowls if any one is near win|ning the game, he
never fails in the next ca&s;t to mi&s;take his bia&s;s. It is impo&s;&s;ible
for the mo&s;t de&s;potic monarch to be more ab&s;olute over his &s;ubjects,
than I am over the&s;e &s;laves and &s;ycophants. Yet in &s;pite of all their
endeavours to oblige me, I mo&s;t heartily de&s;pi&s;e them, and have al|ready 
<PB N="777" REF="352"> drawn up a will, in which I have bequeathed to each of
them a &s;hilling and a dog-collar.</P>
<P>BUT though I have &s;ettled in my mind what legacies I &s;hall
leave them, I have not thoroughly re&s;olved in what manner I &s;hall
di&s;po&s;e of the bulk of my e&s;tate. Indeed I am fully determined, like
mo&s;t other wealthy bachelors, either to leave my fortune to &s;ome
o&s;tentatious pious u&s;es, or to per&s;ons, whom I have never &s;een, and for
who&s;e cha|racters I have not the lea&s;t regard or e&s;teem. To &s;peak
&s;in|cerely, o&s;tentation carries away my whole heart: but then it is a
little difficult to find out a new object to indulge my va|nity, whil&s;t I am
on this &s;ide the grave; by &s;ecuring to me a certain pro&s;pect of
po&s;thumous fame, which is always &s;o agreeable to living pride.</P>
<P>THE ho&s;pitals are &s;o numerous that my name will be lo&s;t
among tho&s;e more known and e&s;tabli&s;hed of <HI>Guy, Morden, Bancroft,</HI>
and I know not who. Be&s;ides in the &s;pace of four or five centuries perhaps
it may be thought, notwith&s;tanding my whole length picture and &s;tatue, that
I had a&s;&s;i&s;tance from parliament. If I order my money to be laid out in
churches, they will never be built. If in temple, gardens, lakes, obeli&s;ks,
and &s;erpentine rivers; the next generation of the &s;ons of Ta&s;te will
demoli&s;h all my works, turn my rounds into &s;quares, and my &s;quares into
rounds, and not leave even my bu&s;t, although it were ca&s;t a plai&s;ter of
<HI>Paris</HI> by Mr. <HI>Rac&s;trow,</HI> or worked up in wax by Mr.
<HI>Goupy.</HI> Or &s;uppo&s;ing in imitation of &s;ome of my predece&s;&s;ors,
I were to bequeath my fortune to my hou&s;ekeeper, and recommend her in my will
as a pattern of virtue, diligence, and every good quality, what will be the
effect? In three weeks <PB N="778" REF="353"> after my death &s;he will marry
an <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> and I &s;hall not even enjoy my monument and marble
perriwig in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abby.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING perplexes me &s;o much as the di&s;po&s;al of my money
by my la&s;t will and te&s;tament. While I am living, it procures the mo&s;t
&s;ervile compliance with all my whims from my &s;ycophants, and &s;everal
other conveniences: but I would fain buy fame with it after my death. Do but
in|&s;truct me, how I may lay it out in the mo&s;t valuable pur|cha&s;es of
this &s;ort, only di&s;cover &s;ome new object of charity, and perhaps I may
bequeath you a round &s;um of money for your advice.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, SIR, Your humble Servant, THOMAS
VAINALL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>IT is &s;aid by an old poet, that no man's life can be called
happy or unhappy till his death: in like manner I have often thought that no
words or actions are a better comment on a per&s;on's temper and
di&s;po&s;ition, than his la&s;t will and te&s;tament. This is a true
portraiture of him&s;elf drawn at full length by his own hand, in which the
painting is com|monly very lively, and the features very &s;trongly marked. In
the di&s;charge of this &s;olemn act, people &s;ign and &s;eal them&s;elves,
either wi&s;e and good characters, or villains and &s;ools: and any per&s;on
that makes a ridiculous will, and be|queaths his money to frivolous u&s;es,
only takes a great deal of pains, like <HI>Dogberry</HI> in the play, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he may be &s;et down and a&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="779" REF="354">THE love of fame governs our actions more
univer&s;ally than any other pa&s;&s;ion. All the re&s;t gradually drop off,
but this runs through our whole lives. This perhaps is one of the chief
inducements that influences wealthy per|&s;ons to bequeath their
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to o&s;tentatious u&s;es, and they would as willingly lay
out a con&s;iderable &s;um in buying a great name (if po&s;&s;ible) at their
deaths, as they would be&s;tow it on the purcha&s;e of a coat of heraldry
during their lives. They are plea&s;ed with leaving &s;ome memorial of their
exi&s;tence behind them, and to perpetuate the remembrance of them&s;elves by
the application of their money of &s;ome vain-glorious purpo&s;es; though the
good gentlemen never did one act to make them&s;elves remarkable, laid out a
&s;ingle &s;hilling in a laudable manner, while they lived. If an
<HI>Apotheo&s;is</HI> were to be bought, how many rich &s;coundrels would be
deified after their deaths! not a plumb in the city but would purcha&s;e this
imaginary god&s;hip, as readily as he paid for his freedom at his fir&s;t
&s;etting up; and I doubt not but this fanta&s;tical di&s;tinction would be
more frequent on an e&s;cutcheon, than a coronet.</P>
<P>THE di&s;po&s;al of our fortunes by our la&s;t will &s;hould be
con&s;idered as the di&s;charge of a &s;acred tru&s;t, which we &s;hould
endeavour to execute in a ju&s;t manner; and as we have had the enjoyment of
rich po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, we ought care|fully to provide that they may devolve
to tho&s;e, who have the mo&s;t natural claim to them. They who may fir&s;t
de|mand our favour, are tho&s;e who are allied to us by the ties of blood: next
to the&s;e &s;tand tho&s;e per&s;ons to whom we are connected by friend&s;hip:
and next to our friends and rela|tions, mankind in general. But the humanity of
a te&s;|tator will not be thought very exten&s;ive, though it reaches 
<PB N="780" REF="355"> to po&s;terity, or includes the poor in general, if it
neg|lects the objects of charity immediately under his eye, or tho&s;e
individuals who have the be&s;t title to his benevolence. <HI>Virgil</HI> has
placed tho&s;e rich men, who be&s;towed none of their wealth on their
relations, among the chief per&s;onages in his Hell. Wherefore I would advi&s;e
my good corre&s;pondent Mr. <HI>Vainall</HI> fir&s;t to con&s;ider, whether he
has not &s;ome poor relation, &s;tarving perhaps in &s;ome di&s;tant part of
the king|dom: after that let him look round, whether he has not &s;ome friends,
whom he may po&s;&s;ibly relieve from mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s. But if he has
no relation, nor no per&s;on in the world that has any regard for him, before
he begins to en|dow a college or found an ho&s;pital, I &s;hould take it as a
par|ticular favour if he would leave his money to me, and will promi&s;e to
immortalize his memory in the <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur.</HI></P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Mr. TOWN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_PRAY hear both &s;ides fairly, before you judge; for (to
u&s;e a vulgar expre&s;&s;ion) one &s;tory is good, till the other is told. I
am, &s;ir, the unfortunate wife of that <PB N="782" REF="357"> inelegant (I had
almo&s;t &s;aid in&s;en&s;ible) hu&s;band, who in your paper of the eighth
in&s;tant pronounces and pub|li&s;hes me to be mad, &s;tark mad.</P>
<P>I CONFESS and glory in my pa&s;&s;ion for mu&s;ic: and can
there be a nobler or a more generous one? My nerves are naturally &s;trung to
harmony, and variou&s;ly affected by the various combinations of the
<HI>Gamut.</HI> Some &s;tay in <HI>Italy</HI> added &s;kill and ta&s;te in
compo&s;ition to my natural happy di&s;po&s;ition to mu&s;ic; and the be&s;t
judges, as well as the be&s;t performers in that country, allowed me to have an
uncommon &s;hare of <HI>virt&ugrave;.</HI> I both compo&s;e and per|form,
&s;ir: and though I &s;ay it, perhaps few even of the profe&s;&s;ion
po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>contra-punto</HI> and the <HI>cromatic</HI> bet|ter; and
I have had the un&s;peakable plea&s;ure, of hearing my compo&s;itions and my
performances dignified in <HI>Italy</HI> with the unanimous appellations of
<HI>&s;qui&s;ito, divino,</HI> and <HI>adorevole.</HI></P>
<P>IS there any madne&s;s in this? Does not he better de|&s;erve
that imputation, who&s;e brea&s;t is in&s;en&s;ible and im|penetrable to all
charms and powers of harmony? To be plain, I mean my hu&s;band; whom I have
frequently &s;een yawn, nay leave the room, in the middle of the mo&s;t
touching pathetic, &s;ung by the mo&s;t affecting <HI>Sig|nora Mingotti,</HI>
accompanied by the divine <HI>Signor di Giar|dino.</HI> And yet,&mdash;pardon
this digre&s;&s;ive tran&s;port,&mdash;how irre&s;i&s;tible is the
expre&s;&s;ion, the melody, the cadences, the <HI>appogyraturas</HI> of that
incomparable <HI>virtuo&s;a!</HI> What energy, what delicacy, and what variety
are in the in|imitable <PB N="783" REF="358"> compo&s;itions and execution of
the charming <HI>Sig|nor di Giardino!</HI> What an <HI>arpeggio</HI> he has,
what a <HI>&s;tacca|to,</HI> what an <HI>andante!</HI> In &s;hort, I may I am
&s;ure with truth a&s;&s;ert, that whether in the <HI>allegro</HI> or the
<HI>piano,</HI> the <HI>adagio,</HI> the <HI>largo,</HI> or the <HI>forte,</HI>
he never had his equal. O, Mr. TOWN, what an irretrievable lo&s;s has this
coun|try &s;u&s;tained! My good man, among his other qualifi|cations, is a
politician, you mu&s;t know; and one of his principal objections again&s;t
the&s;e <HI>virtuo&s;i</HI> is, that they are foreigners. He flew into a
violent pa&s;&s;ion with me la&s;t <HI>Sunday</HI> night, becau&s;e I had a
concert at my hou&s;e, when (he &s;aid) &s;uch bad news were received from
abroad. I know not what he, and other muddy-headed politicians may think: but
let him talk what he will of THE <HI>Blakeney,</HI> THE Governor, THE Admiral,
I am &s;ure the nation cannot &s;u&s;tain a greater evil than the lo&s;s of THE
<HI>Mingotti;</HI> who, as the public prints will inform you, 
<Q REND="inline">"is gone to <HI>Holland,</HI> till her affairs
in <HI>England</HI> can be &s;ettled."</Q></P>
<P>BUT however gothic my hu&s;band may be, I am fully determined
to di&s;charge the duty of a good wife. Ac|cordingly, whenever he comes into my
room, I &s;it down to my harp&s;ichord, and &s;ing and play the mo&s;t
&s;oothing pieces of mu&s;ic, in hopes &s;ome time or other of hitting his
uni&s;on, but hitherto to no purpo&s;e; and, to &s;ay the truth, I fear he has
not one harmonic nerve in his whole &s;y&s;tem, though otherwi&s;e a man of
good plain &s;en&s;e. When he interrupts my performances, (as in his letter he
owns that he does) with wi&s;hing for the men from <PB N="784" REF="359">
<HI>Mother Midnight's,</HI> with their wooden &s;poons, &s;alt-boxes,
jews-harps, and broom-&s;ticks, to play in concert with me; I an&s;wer him with
all gentlene&s;s and calmne&s;s ima|ginable.&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"Indeed, my dear, you have not the lea&s;t
no|tion of the&s;e things. It would be impo&s;&s;ible to bring tho&s;e
ridiculous in&s;truments into a concert, and to adapt a thorough ba&s;s to
them: they have not above three notes at mo&s;t, and tho&s;e cannot be

<Q REND="inline">"for all that, an&s;wers he, that they were

le&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>THIS article of <HI>expence</HI> he often dwells upon, and
&s;ometimes even with warmth; to which I reply with all the mildne&s;s that
becomes a good wife, 
<Q REND="inline">"My dear, you have a good fortune of your own,
and I brought you &s;till a better. Of what u&s;e is money, if not em|ployed?
and how can it be better employed, than in encouraging and rewarding
di&s;tingui&s;hed <HI>gu&s;to</HI> and merit? The&s;e people, that you call
ballad-&s;ingers and pipers, are people of birth, though for the mo&s;t part of
&s;mall fortunes; and they are much more con&s;i|dered, as you know, in
<HI>Italy,</HI> than all the greate&s;t antient <HI>Roman</HI> heroes, if
revived, would now be. Many of them, who would perhaps make a figure in the
church or the &s;tate, have been con&s;iderable lo&s;ers by devoting
them&s;elves to the plea&s;ures of mankind. They leave their own country, where
they are infinitely e&s;teemed for their moral as well as their mu&s;ical
characters, and generou&s;ly &s;acrifice all <PB N="785" REF="360"> the&s;e
advantages to our diver&s;ion. Be&s;ides, my dear, what &s;hould we do wi&s;h
our money? would you lavi&s;h it away, upon foundling ba&s;tards, lying-in
women who have either no hu&s;bands or too many, importunate beggars, all
who&s;e cries and complaints are the mo&s;t &s;hocking di&s;cords? or
&s;uppo&s;e that we were to &s;ave our money, and leave our children better
fortunes, who knows but they might, as too many do, &s;quander them away idly?
whereas what we give to the&s;e <HI>virtuo&s;i,</HI> we know is given to merit.
For my own part, my dear, I have infinite plea&s;ure, when I can get any of
them to accept of fifty or an hundred guineas, which by the way cannot always
be brought about without &s;ome art and contri|vance; for they are mo&s;t
exceedingly nice and de|licate upon the point of honour, e&s;pecially in the
article of money. And I look upon &s;uch trifling pre&s;ents as a debt due to
&s;uperior talents and merit; and I endeavour to in&s;inuate them in a way that
the receiver may not blu&s;h."</Q> &mdash;Here my hu&s;band breaks out into a
violent pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;ays,&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"Oons, madam, &s;how me a <HI>virtuo&s;o</HI>
or a <HI>virtuo&s;a,</HI> (as you call them) who ever blu&s;hed in their lives,
and I will give them the fee &s;imple of my e&s;tate."</Q> You &s;ee, Mr. TOWN,

<HI>divertimenti,</HI> and when he is &s;o violently in <HI>alt,</HI> I will
leave you to judge who it is that is mad, &s;tark mad.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, &s;ir, my hu&s;band is in&s;en&s;ible, untuneable,
to the mo&s;t noble, generous, and &s;tronge&s;t of all hu|man

le&s;&s;er and vulgar cares; for you mu&s;t certainly have ob|&s;erved, Mr.

is fit for no one other thing. Thus truly informed of my ca&s;e, I am &s;ure

<P>_NO other di&s;po&s;ition or turn of mind &s;o totally unfits a

the world in a &s;tate of perfection, but has left us in a capacity of
improvement: which &s;hould &s;eem to intimate that we &s;hould labour to
render our&s;elves excellent. Very few are &s;uch ab&s;olute ideots, as not to
be able to become at lea&s;t decent, if not eminent, in their &s;everal
&s;tations, by unwearied and keen application: nor are there any po&s;&s;e&s;t
of &s;uch tran&s;cendant genius and abilities, as to render all pains and
diligence unnece&s;&s;ary. Per&s;everance will over|come difficulties, which at
fir&s;t appear in&s;uperable; and it is amazing to con&s;ider, how great and
numerous ob&s;tacles may be removed by a continual attention to any particular
point. I will not mention here the trite example of <HI>De|mo&s;thenes,</HI>
who got over the greate&s;t natural impediments to oratory, but content
my&s;elf with a more modern and fami|liar in&s;tance. Being at <HI>Sadler's
Wells</HI> a few nights ago, I could not but admire the &s;urprizing feats of
activity there exhibited, and at the &s;ame time reflected what incredible
pains and labour it mu&s;t have co&s;t the performers, to ar|rive at the art of
writhing their bodies into &s;uch various and unnatural contortions. But I was
mo&s;t taken with the ingenious arti&s;t, who after fixing two bells to each
foot, the &s;ame number to each hand, and with great propriety placing a cap
and bells on his head, played &s;everal tunes, and went through as regular
triple peals <PB N="789" REF="364"> and <HI>Bob Majors</HI> as the boys at
<HI>Chri&s;t Church</HI> Ho&s;pital; all which he effected by the due jerking
of his arms and legs, and nodding his head backward and forward. If this
arti&s;t had taken equal pains to employ his head in another way, he might
perhaps have been as deep a proficient in numbers as <HI>Jedediah Buxton,</HI>
or at lea&s;t a tolerable modern rhimer, of which he is now no bad emblem: and
if our fine ladies would u&s;e equal diligence, they might fa&s;hion their
minds as &s;ucce&s;sfully as Madam <HI>Catharina</HI> di&s;torts her body.</P>
<P>THERE is not in the world a more u&s;ele&s;s idle animal, than
he who contents him&s;elf with being merely a Gentle|man. He has an e&s;tate,
therefore he will not endeavour to acquire knowledge: he is not to labour in
any vocation, therefore he will do nothing. But the misfortune is that there is
no &s;uch thing in nature as negative virtue, and that ab&s;olute idlene&s;s is
impracticable. He who does no good, will certainly do mi&s;chief; and the mind,
if it is not &s;tored with u&s;eful knowledge, will nece&s;&s;arily become a
magazine of non&s;en&s;e and trifles. Wherefore a Gentleman, though he is not
obliged to ri&s;e to open his &s;hop or work at his trade, may always find
&s;ome ways of employing his time to advantage. If he makes no advances in
wi&s;dom, he will become more and more a &s;lave to folly; and he that does
nothing becau&s;e he has nothing to do, will become vicious and abandoned, or
at be&s;t ridiculous and contemptible.</P>
<P>THERE is not a more melancholy object, than a man of an hone&s;t
heart and fine natural abilities who&s;e good quali|ties are thus de&s;troyed
by Indolence. Such a per&s;on is a con&s;tant plague to all his friends and
acquaintance, with all the means in his power of adding to their happine&s;s;
and <PB N="790" REF="365"> &s;uffers him&s;elf to rank among the lowe&s;t
characters, when he might render him&s;elf con&s;picuous among the highe&s;t.
Nobody is more univer&s;ally beloved, and more univer&s;ally avoided than my
friend <HI>Carele&s;s.</HI> He is a humane man, who never did a beneficent
action; and a man of un&s;haken integrity, on whom it is impo&s;&s;ible to
depend. With the be&s;t head, and the be&s;t heart, he regulates his conduct in
the mo&s;t ab&s;urd manner, and frequently injures his friends; for whoever
neglects to do ju&s;tice to him&s;elf, mu&s;t in|evitably wrong tho&s;e with
whom he is connected; and it is by no means a true maxim, that an idle man
hurts nobody but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>VIRTUE then is not to be con&s;idered in the light of mere
innocence, or ab&s;taining from harm, but as the exertion of our faculties in
doing good: as <HI>Titus,</HI> when he had let a day &s;lip,
undi&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome act of virtue, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"I have lo&s;t a day."</Q> If we regard our time
in this light, how many days &s;hall we look back upon as irretrievably lo&s;t?
and to how narrow a compa&s;s would &s;uch a method of cal|culation frequently
reduce the longe&s;t life? If we were to number our days, according as we have
applied them to virtue, it would occa&s;ion &s;trange revolutions in the manner
of reckoning the ages of men. We &s;hould &s;ee &s;ome few men arrived to a
good old age in the prime of their youth, and meet with &s;everal young fellows
of four&s;core.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE to this way of thinking, I remember to have met with
the epitaph of an aged man, four years old: dating his exi&s;tence, from the
time of his reformation from evil cour&s;es. The in&s;criptions on mo&s;t
tomb-&s;tones commemo|rate no acts of virtue performed by the per&s;ons who lie
under <PB N="791" REF="366"> them, but only record that they were born one day
and died another. But I would fain have tho&s;e people, who&s;e lives have been
u&s;ele&s;s, rendered of &s;ome &s;ervice after their deaths, by affording
le&s;&s;ons of in&s;truction and morality to tho&s;e they leave behind them.
Wherefore I could wi&s;h, that in every pari&s;h &s;everal acres were marked
out for a new and &s;pacious Burying-Ground: in which every per&s;on, who&s;e
remains are there depo&s;ited, &s;hould have a &s;mall &s;tone laid over them,
reckon|ing their age according to the manner in which they have improved or
abu&s;ed the time allotted them in their lives. In &s;uch circum&s;tances, the
plate on a coffin might be the high|e&s;t panegyric which the decea&s;ed could
receive; and a lit|tle &s;quare &s;tone, in&s;cribed with <HI>Ob. Ann.
Aetat.</HI> 80. would be a nobler eulogium than all the lapidary adulation of
mo|dern epitaphs. In a Burying-Ground of this nature, allow|ing for the
partiality of &s;urvivors, which would certainly point out the mo&s;t brilliant
actions of their dead friends, we might perhaps &s;ee &s;ome in&s;criptions,
not much unlike the following.</P>
<Q>Here lie the remains of a celebrated Beauty, aged 50, who died
in the fifth year of her age. She was born in her eighteenth year, and was
untimely killed by the &s;mall pox in her twenty third.</Q>
<Q> Here re&s;ts in eternal &s;leep the mortal part of L.
<HI>B.</HI> a Free|thinker, aged 88, an Infant. He came into the world by
chance in the year &mdash; and was <HI>annihilated</HI> in the fir&s;t year of
his age.</Q>
<Q> Here continue to rot the bones of a noted Buck, an em|bryo, who
never &s;hewed any &s;igns of life, and after twenty <PB N="792" REF="367">
three years was &s;o totally putrified, that it could not be kept above ground
any longer.</Q>
<Q> Here lies the &s;woln carca&s;e of a Boon Companion, who was
born in a drop&s;y in the 40th year of his age: He lin|gered in this condition,
till he was obliged to be tapped, when he relap&s;ed into his former condition,
and died in the &s;econd year of his age, and the 23d of his drinking.</Q>
<Q> Here lies <HI>I&s;aac Da-Co&s;ta,</HI> a convert from
Judai&s;m, aged 64. He was born and chri&s;tened in his 61&s;t year, and died
in the true Faith in the third year of his age.</Q>
<Q> Here is depo&s;ited the body of the celebrated Beau
<HI>Tawdry,</HI> who was born at court in the year &mdash; on a
<HI>Birthnight,</HI> and died of grief in his &s;econd year upon the court's
going into mourning.</Q>
<Q> Here rots A. <HI>B. Still</HI>-born, who died of a fright on
the twentieth of May, 1756.</Q>
<Q> Here re&s;ts from his labours the Brave General <HI>B.</HI> who

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P>_I KNOW not any greater misfortune that can happen to a young
fellow at his fir&s;t &s;etting out in life, than his falling into Low Company.
He that &s;inks to a familiarity with per&s;ons much below his own level, will
be con&s;tantly weighed down by his ba&s;e connections: and though he may
ea&s;ily plunge &s;till lower, he will find it impo&s;&s;ible ever to ri&s;e
again. We cannot give a liberal <PB N="794" REF="369"> turn of mind to a vulgar
by introducing him to genteel company, any more than we can make a beau of him
by dre&s;&s;ing him in embroidery: but a gentlemen will as na|turally catch the
manners of a blackguard by mixing with blackguards, as he would daub his
cloaths with foot by running again&s;t a chimney-&s;weeper.</P>
<P>BY Low Company I would not be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean the be&s;t
and mo&s;t valuable part of mankind, which have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the
name of Middling &s;ort of people: though I am not ignorant, that the&s;e are
de&s;pi&s;ed by all, who would be thought to keep the Be&s;t Company. The apes
of quality affect to look upon all others, who have no reli&s;h for the
amu&s;ements of high life, or do not chu&s;e to pay a guinea for their
ordinary, as downright vulgars: and it was with the utmo&s;t contempt I once
heard a young coxcomb of fa&s;hion &s;peak of a mo&s;t inti|mate friend, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he &s;hould be forced to drop his
ac|quaintance, becau&s;e he kept &s;uch low company."</Q> Nei|ther would I
confine this appellation &s;olely to the inferior order of trade&s;men and
mechanics, or the whole body of the mobility in general: for although this rank
of people may be literally &s;aid to be in low life, a right honourable, who
lets him&s;elf down to the manners of a porter or a hackney-coachman, differs
from them in nothing but his title.</P>
<P>A PROPENSITY to Low Company is either owing to an original
meanne&s;s of &s;pirit, a want of education, or <PB N="795" REF="370"> an
ill-placed pride, commonly ari&s;ing from both the fore-mentioned cau&s;es.
Tho&s;e, who are naturally of a grovelling di&s;po&s;ition, &s;hew it even at
&s;chool, by chu&s;ing their play-mates from the &s;cum of the cla&s;s; and are
never &s;o happy, as when they can &s;teal down to romp with the &s;ervants in
the kitchen. But the mo&s;t frequent cau&s;e is the de&s;ire of being, as it is
called, the head of the company; and a per&s;on of this humble ambition will be
very well content to pay the reckoning, for the honour of being
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of The Gentle|man. It &s;ometimes happens, that
a man of genius and learning will &s;toop to receive the incen&s;e of mean and
illiterate flatterers in a porter-hou&s;e or a cyder-cellar: and I remember to
have heard of a poet, who was once caught in a bawdy-hou&s;e in the very fact,
of reading his ver&s;es to the good old mother and a circle of her
daughters.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome, who have been led into Low Company, merely
from an affectation of Humour; and from a notion of &s;eeing life, and a
de&s;ire of being ac|counted men of humour, have de&s;cended to a&s;&s;ociate
with the meane&s;t of the mob, and picked their cronies from
<HI>White-Chapel</HI> and <HI>Broad St. Giles</HI>'s. Of the&s;e cha|racters
the mo&s;t remarkable is a young fellow of family and fortune, who was born and
bred a gentleman, but has taken great pains to degrade him&s;elf; and is now as
complete a blackguard as tho&s;e whom he has cho&s;en for his companions. He
will drink purl in a <PB N="796" REF="371"> morning, &s;moke his pipe in a
night-cellar, and eat black puddings at <HI>Bartholomew Fair,</HI> for the
Humour of the thing. All the while, he is reckoned by his friends to be a
mighty good-natured gentleman, and without the lea&s;t bit of pride in him.</P>
<P>IN order to qualify him&s;elf for the &s;ociety of the vulgar,
<HI>Bob</HI> has &s;tudied and practi&s;ed all the vulgar arts under the be&s;t
ma&s;ters. He has therefore cultivated an intimacy with <HI>Buckhor&s;e,</HI>
and is very proud of being &s;ometimes admitted to the honour of conver&s;ing
with the great <HI>Broughton</HI> him&s;elf. He is al&s;o very well known among
the hackney-coachmen, as a brother|whip: but his greate&s;t excellence is
cricket-playing, in which he is reckoned as good a bat as either of the
<HI>Bennets</HI>; and is at length arrived at the &s;upreme dig|nity of being
di&s;tingui&s;hed among his brethren of the wicket by the title of <HI>Long
Robin.</HI></P>
<P>IT is diverting enough to con&s;ider the fate of many of
<HI>Bob</HI>'s intimate friends and acquaintance. It mu&s;t be owned, that
&s;ome of the&s;e have come to an untimely end; that &s;ome have been &s;ent
abroad, and others been &s;et in the pillory, or whipt in <HI>Bridewell.</HI>
One of <HI>Bob</HI>'s favourite amu&s;ements is attending the executions at
<HI>Tyburn:</HI> and it once happened, that one of his com|panions was
unfortunately brought thither; when <HI>Bob</HI> carried his regard for his
decea&s;ed friend &s;o far, as to <PB N="797" REF="372"> get him&s;elf knocked
down in endeavouring to re&s;cue the body from the &s;urgeons.</P>
<P>As <HI>Bob</HI> con&s;tantly affects to mimic the air and
man|ners of the vulgar, he takes care to enrich his conver|&s;ation with the
emphatical oaths and expre&s;&s;ive dialect of <HI>Billing&s;gate</HI> and
<HI>St. Giles</HI>'s; which never fails to re|commend him as a man of excellent
humour among the <HI>Choice Spirits</HI> and the <HI>Sons of &s;ound &s;en&s;e
and &s;atis|faction,</HI> and frequently promotes him to the chair in the&s;e
facetious &s;ocieties. But he is particularly famous for &s;inging tho&s;e
<HI>Cant Songs,</HI> drawn up in the lingo of &s;harpers and pick-pockets; the
humour of which he greatly &s;ets off and heightens, by &s;crewing up his
mouth, and rolling about a large quid of tobacco be|tween his jaws.</P>
<P><HI>BOB</HI> has indulged the &s;ame notions of humour even in
his amours: and he is well known to every &s;treet-walker between
<HI>Charing-Cro&s;s</HI> and <HI>Cheap-Side.</HI> This has ruined his
con&s;titution, and often involved him in &s;everal unluckly &s;crapes. He has
been fre|quently brui&s;ed, beat, and kicked by the bullies in
<HI>Fleet-Ditch</HI> and <HI>Blood-Bowl Alley</HI>; and he was once &s;oundly
drubbed by a &s;oldier for engaging with his trull in St. <HI>James</HI>'s
Park. The la&s;t time I &s;aw him, he was laid up with two black eyes, and a
broken pate, which he got in a midnight &s;kirmi&s;h about a mi&s;tre&s;s in a
night-cellar. He had carried down a <PB N="798" REF="373"> bunter which he had
picked up in the &s;treets, in order to treat her with a quartern of gin royal;
when a &s;turdy chairman attempting to take away his doxy, a battle en&s;ued
between them, and he was &s;everely handled, amid the univer&s;al cry of the
whole company, of&mdash;kick him <HI>up</HI> &s;tairs&mdash;kick him

<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IF we look into the &s;everal inns of court, the profe&s;t
&s;tudents of the law compo&s;e a very numerous body: but if we afterwards turn
our eyes on tho&s;e few, who are employed in exerci&s;ing their talents in
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> this prodigious army of lawyers &s;hrinks to a
very thin and incon&s;iderable corps. Thou&s;ands, it &s;eems, are
di&s;gu&s;ted with the unplea&s;ing dryne&s;s of the &s;tudy, as it is now
ma|naged, and conceive an unconquerable aver&s;ion to the white 
<PB N="800" REF="375"> leaves and the old black letter. This early di&s;like to
legal enquiries certainly proceeds from the fatal mi&s;takes in the plan of
&s;tudy hitherto marked out. According to all &s;y&s;tems now extant, it is
ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to be at once a lawyer and a fine gentleman. Seeing
with concern the many evils ari&s;ing from the&s;e erroneous principles, I have
at length devi&s;ed a method to remedy all the&s;e inconveniences; a method,
now very &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed by &s;everal young gentlemen. Wherefore I
mu&s;t beg leave to &s;ubmit my thoughts to the public by means of your paper,
and to chalk out the out|lines of a treati&s;e, now ready for the pre&s;s,
intitled <HI>The Com|plete Barri&s;ter,</HI> or, <HI>a New In&s;titute of the
Laws of England.</HI></P>
<P>MY Lord <HI>Coke</HI> pre&s;cribes to our &s;tudent to follow
the ad|vice given in the ancient ver&s;es, prefixed to this letter, for the
good &s;pending of the day. 
<Q REND="inline">"Six hours to &s;leep, &s;ix to the &s;tudy of
the law, four to prayer, two to meals, and the re&s;t to the Mu&s;es."</Q> But
what an ab&s;urd and un|fa&s;hionable di&s;tribution of the four and twenty
hours! I will venture a thou&s;and pounds to a &s;hilling, that not one
&s;tudent in the kingdom divides his time in this manner. Here is not a
&s;ingle word of <HI>Vauxhall, Ranelagh,</HI> the theatres, or other public
diver&s;ions; not to mention that nobody but a methodi&s;t would ever think of
praying four hours, and that it would be impo&s;&s;ible, though we were content
with &s;nap|ping up a chop every day at <HI>Betty</HI>'s, to di&s;patch even
dinner in two. How then &s;hall we reconcile the&s;e precepts, &s;carce
practicable by a hermit, to the life of a young gentleman who keeps the be&s;t
company? Or how can the&s;e rules for &s;evere application be made
con&s;i&s;tent with the practice of tho&s;e, who divide their whole time
between eating, drink|ing, &s;leeping, and amu&s;ements? Well knowing that the 
<PB N="801" REF="376"> volatile di&s;po&s;itions of the young gentlemen of the
pre&s;ent age can never &s;ubmit the ordering of their lives to any
pre|&s;cribed rules, I have endeavoured to &s;quare my precepts to their lives;
and have &s;o contrived the matter, that amid&s;t the keene&s;t per&s;uit of
their plea&s;ures, they &s;hall be engaged in the mo&s;t improving cour&s;e of
the law.</P>
<P>AS laws are chiefly nothing el&s;e but rules of action, what
can be more cruel and ab&s;urd, than to coop up a bri&s;k young man to learn in
his chambers, what he can &s;o much better teach him&s;elf by going abroad into
the world? I propo&s;e to do&s;e gentlemen with &s;tudy, as Dr. <HI>Rock</HI>
does with phy&s;ic, to be taken at home or abroad without lo&s;s of time or
hindrance of bu&s;ine&s;s. This, I am convinced, is not only the be&s;t
me|thod, but al&s;o the only &s;cheme which &s;everal inhabitants of the inns
of court would ever follow. I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent fore&s;tall the contents
of my treati&s;e by pre&s;enting you with a dry ab&s;tract of it, but rather
endeavour to give you an idea of the &s;pirit and manner in which it is
written, by delineating the plan diligently per&s;ued by one of my favourite
pupils: and I cannot but congratulate the bar, that &s;o many young men,
in&s;tead of blinding their eyes and bewildering their under|&s;tandings with
<HI>Coke, Plowden, Salkeld,</HI> &amp;c. have &s;en&s;e enough to follow the
&s;ame cour&s;e of &s;tudy.</P>
<P>TOM RIOT, the principal ornament of my cla&s;s of &s;tu|dents,
was &s;ent to the <HI>Temple,</HI> not with any intention that he &s;hould
become a great lawyer, but merely becau&s;e, for a few years, his father did
not know how to di&s;po&s;e of him other|wi&s;e: but &s;o unwearied has been
his application to the new method, that his father and the re&s;t of his
friends will, I doubt not, be &s;urprized at his wonderful proficiency. As 
<PB N="802" REF="377"> nothing is of more con&s;equence to tho&s;e gentlemen,
who in|tend to harangue at the bar, than the acquiring a ready elo|cution, and
an ea&s;y habit of delivering their thoughts in pub|lic, to this I paid
particular attention. For this purpo&s;e, I advi&s;ed him to a diligent
attendance on the theatres, and I a&s;&s;ure you, Mr. TOWN, he never fails to
take notes at a new play, and &s;eldom or never mi&s;&s;es appearing at one
hou&s;e or the other in the green boxes. He has al&s;o gathered many beautiful
flowers of rhetorick, unblown upon by all other orators ancient or modern, from
the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society; and at the &s;ame place he has collected the
&s;tronge&s;t argu|ments on every &s;ubject, and habituated him&s;elf to modes
of rea&s;oning never hitherto introduced into courts of ju&s;tice. But what has
been of more than ordinary &s;ervice to him, and is particularly recommended by
Lord <HI>Coke</HI> him&s;elf, who calls 
<Q REND="inline">"conference the life of &s;tudy,"</Q> is his
&s;o frequent atten|dance at <HI>George</HI>'s and the other coffee-hou&s;es
about the <HI>Tem|ple,</HI> where every &s;tudent has &s;o many opportunities
of bene|fiting him&s;elf by daily conver&s;ation with coun&s;ellors,
attor|nies, clerks to attornies, and other &s;ages of law.</P>
<P>THE law is intended to take cogni&s;ance of all our actions,
wherefore my pupil, who is fond of exerting his faculties in polite life, has
already dige&s;ted almo&s;t all the grand lead|ing points of the law into a
journal of his tran&s;actions, which I &s;hall lay before my readers at large
in my treati&s;e, as the be&s;t method for a common-place-book. Thus for
in&s;tance, having been frequently employed, after leaving the
<HI>Shake|&s;peare,</HI> in what is called <HI>beating the rounds,</HI> it has
happened to him to be taken into cu&s;tody by the magi&s;trate of the night,
and carried the next morning before a ju&s;tice, by which means he has attained
as full a knowledge of certain parts of the duty of a con&s;table and ju&s;tice
of peace, as could be collected from <HI>Dalton, Blackerby,</HI> or
<HI>Burn.</HI> Certain impertinences of his taylor and other trade&s;men have
given him a very clear notion of the laws of arre&s;t, and been of as 
<PB N="803" REF="378"> much &s;ervice to him as the be&s;t treati&s;es on bail
and main-prize. Be&s;ides which, the &s;everal &s;ums of money which he has
taken up at different times payable on his father's death, have opened to him
&s;ome difficult points in conveyancing, by teaching him the nature of bonds,
deeds, &amp;c. and have at the &s;ame time &s;hewn him what Lord <HI>Coke</HI>
calls, 
<Q REND="inline">"the ami|able and admirable &s;ecrets of the
common law,"</Q> by un|ravelling to him the intricate doctrines of rever&s;ion
and re|mainder, as well as the general nature of e&s;tates. Thus he is
continually improving, and whenever he &s;hould happen to commit a rape or a
genteel murder, it will &s;erve him for matter of in&s;truction as well as any
hi&s;tory of the pleas of the crown, and give him an in&s;ight into the nature
of the prac|tice and extent of the juri&s;diction of our courts of
ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>BY this plan of &s;tudy no time is lo&s;t; &s;o that while
other &s;tudents are idling away their vacation in the country, my pupil is
daily improving there. As he is a member of the a&s;&s;ociation, he is very
conver&s;ant in all the laws enacted for the pre&s;ervation of the game; and he
picks up all the learning of the circuit by dancing at the Balls at the
a&s;&s;izes. As his father has a place, he is employed in canva&s;&s;ing for
votes at the time of an election, which in&s;tructs him in all the points of
law touching tho&s;e matters. He was principally concerned in di&s;covering the
<HI>Cu&s;tomary Tenants,</HI> the new &s;pecies of freeholders unknown to
<HI>Littleton, Coke,</HI> and all the lawyers of antiquity: and he is &s;o
intimately acquainted with all the doctrine contained in the &s;everal
clau&s;es of the bribery act, that I propo&s;e publi&s;hing in the body of my
treati&s;e <HI>Les Read|ings Del Mon Seignior</HI> RIOT <HI>Sur L'E&s;tatute
de</HI> 2 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. &amp;c.</P>
<P>BY this time, Mr. TOWN, you mu&s;t perceive that the ground of
my &s;cheme is in &s;hort no more than this, <HI>viz.</HI> that the &s;tudent
&s;hould regard his life as a kind of commentary on the law, as it is
recommended to the clergy to become examples of the doctrine they teach. Or to
bring my illu&s;|tration more home to the&s;e gentlemen, let them learn the law
by being occa&s;ionally intere&s;ted in different parts of it, 
<PB N="804" REF="379"> as they become in &s;ome mea&s;ure doctors of phy&s;ic
from fre|quent need of it, and can cure them&s;elves in certain ca&s;es as well
as <HI>Rock</HI> him&s;elf. In&s;tead of poring over books, a gen|tleman need
only ob&s;erve, how far the law and his actions tally with each other; and as
it is &s;aid by Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"that the knowledge of the law is like a deep
well, out of which each man draweth according to the &s;trength of his
under&s;tanding,"</Q> &s;o in per&s;uance of my plan, the &s;tudent will
improve according to the eagerne&s;s with which he engages in his plea&s;ures:
and this, no doubt, was intended by Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> as it is the mo&s;t
obvious inter|pretation of his words, when he concludes the compari&s;on by
&s;aying, that 
<Q REND="inline">"when the profe&s;&s;or of the law can dive
into the depth, it is <HI>delightful, ea&s;y,</HI> and <HI>without any heavy
bur|then,</HI> &s;o long as he keep him&s;elf <HI>in his own proper
element.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>WHAT plan, Mr. TOWN, can be more <HI>delightful, ea&s;y,</HI>
and <HI>without any heavy burthen</HI> than In&s;titutes of this nature? I have
indeed often looked with concern upon tho&s;e unhappy gentlemen who have
impaired their health by the old me|thod of &s;tudy, and con&s;idered them as
martyrs to huge vo|lumes of reports and &s;tatutes at large: my pupils will be
in no danger of the&s;e misfortunes. It is recorded of an emi|nent coun&s;ellor
of the <HI>North</HI> family, who being one of the able&s;t practitioners at
the bar, was &s;o overloaded with bu&s;ine&s;s, that &s;ometimes chu&s;ing to
retire awhile from hurry and per|plexity, he would &s;ay to his clerk 
<Q REND="inline">"Tell the people I do not practi&s;e this
term."</Q> This proper relaxation I always recommend to my pupils, and have
&s;ome rea&s;on to think they are prudent enough to embrace it; for as I am
ac|quainted with &s;everal &s;tudents on the new plan, and do not remember to
have &s;een them doing any bu&s;ine&s;s in the courts for &s;ome time. I
&s;uppo&s;e they had given notice to their clerks

<LETTER>
<HEAD>Mr. VILLAGE to Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Cou&s;in,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE country at pre&s;ent, no le&s;s than the metropolis,
abounding with politicians of every kind, I begun to de&s;pair of picking up
any intelligence, that might po&s;&s;ibly be entertaining to your readers.
However, I have made a tour to &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the
kingdom with a clergy|man of my acquaintance; and &s;hall not trouble you with
an account of the improvements that have been made in the &s;eats we &s;aw
according to the modern ta&s;te, but pro|ceed <PB N="806" REF="381"> to give
you &s;ome reflections, which occurred to us on ob&s;erving &s;everal country
churches, and the behaviour of their congregations.</P>
<P>THE ruinous condition of &s;ome of the&s;e churches gave me
great offence; and I could not help wi&s;hing, that the hone&s;t vicar,
in&s;tead of indulging his genius for im|provements, by inclo&s;ing his
goo&s;eberry bu&s;hes with a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> rail, and converting half an
acre of his glebe-land into a bowling-green, would have applied part of his
in|come to the more laudable purpo&s;e of &s;heltering his pa|ri&s;hioners from
the weather during their attendance on divine &s;ervice. It is no uncommon
thing to &s;ee the par|&s;onag -hou&s;e well thatched, and in exceeding good
re|pair, while the church perhaps has no better roof than the ivy that grows
over it. The noi&s;e of owls, bats and magpies makes a principal part of the
church mu&s;ick in many of the&s;e ancient edifices; and the walls, like a
large map, &s;eem to be portioned out into capes, &s;eas, and pro|montories by
the various colours with which the damps have &s;tained them. Sometimes it has
happened, that the foundation being too weak to &s;upport the &s;teeple any
longer, it has been found expedient to pull down that part of the building, and
to hang the bells under a wooden &s;hed on the ground be&s;ide it. This is the
ca&s;e in a pari&s;h in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> through which I lately pa&s;&s;ed,
and where the clerk and the &s;exton, like the two figures at St.
<HI>Dun|&s;tan</HI>'s, &s;erve the bells in capacity of clappers, by &s;triking
them alternately with a hammer.</P>
<P>IN other churches I have ob&s;erved, that nothing un|&s;eemly
or ruinous is to be found, except in the clergyman, and in the appendages of
his per&s;on. The &s;quire of the pa|ri&s;h, <PB N="807" REF="382"> or his
ance&s;tors perhaps, to te&s;tify their devotion, and leave a la&s;ting
monument of their magnificence, have adorned the altar-piece with the riche&s;t
crim&s;on velvet, embroidered with vine-leaves and ears of wheat, and have
dre&s;&s;ed up the pulpit with the &s;ame &s;plendour and expence; while the
gentleman who fills it is exalted in the mid&s;t of all this finery with a
&s;urplice as dirty as a farmer's frock, and a periwig that &s;eems to have
tran&s;|ferred its faculty of curling to the band, that appears in full-buckle
beneath it,</P>
<P>BUT if I was concerned to &s;ee many of our country churches
in a tottering condition, I was more offended with the indecency of wor&s;hip
in others. I could wi&s;h that the pa&s;tors would inform their hearers, that
there is no occa&s;ion to &s;cream them&s;elves hoar&s;e in making the
re&s;pon&s;es, that the town-cryer is not the only per&s;on qualified to pray
with due devotion, and that he who bawls the loude&s;t may neverthele&s;s be
the wickede&s;t fellow in the pari&s;h. The old women too in the ayle might be
told that their time would be better employed in attending to the &s;ermon,
than in fumbling over their tattered te&s;taments till they have found the
text, by which time the di&s;cour&s;e is near drawing to a conclu|&s;ion; while
a word or two of in&s;truction might not be thrown away upon the younger part
of the congregation to teach them, that making po&s;ies in &s;ummer-time, and
cracking nuts in autumn, is no part of the religious ceremony.</P>
<P>THE good old practice of p&s;alm-&s;inging is, indeed,
wonderfully improved in many country churches &s;ince the days of
<HI>Sternhold</HI> and <HI>Hopkins</HI>; and there is &s;carce a 
<PB N="808" REF="383"> pari&s;h-clerk, who has &s;o little ta&s;te as not to
pick his &s;taves out of the New Ver&s;ion. This has occa&s;ioned great
complaints in &s;ome places, where the clerk has been forced to bawl by
him&s;elf, becau&s;e the re&s;t of the congregation cannot find the p&s;alm at
the end of their prayer-books; while others are highly di&s;gu&s;ted at the
innovation, and &s;tick as ob&s;tinately to the Old Ver&s;ion as to the Old
Stile. The tunes them&s;elves have al&s;o been new-&s;et to jiggi&s;h
mea&s;ures; and the &s;ober drawl, which u&s;ed to accompany the two fir&s;t
&s;taves of the hundredth p&s;alm with the <HI>gloria patri,</HI> is now
&s;plit into as many quavers as an <HI>Italian</HI> air. For this purpo&s;e
there is in every county an itinerant band of vocal mu&s;icians, who make it
their bu&s;ine&s;s to go round to all the churches in their turns, and, after a
prelude with the pitch-pipe, a&s;toni&s;h the audience with hymns &s;et to the
new <HI>Win|che&s;ter</HI> mea&s;ure and anthems of their own compo&s;ing. As
the&s;e new-fa&s;hioned p&s;almodi&s;ts are nece&s;&s;arily made up of young
men and maids, we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e, that there is a perfect concord
and &s;ymphony between them: and, indeed, I have known it happen, that the&s;e
&s;weet &s;ingers have been brought more than once into di&s;grace, by too
clo&s;e an uni&s;on between the thorough-ba&s;e and the treble.</P>
<P>IT is a difficult matter to decide, which is looked upon to be
the greate&s;t man in a country church, the par&s;on or his clerk. The latter
is mo&s;t certainly held in higher veneration, where the former happens to be
only a poor curate, who rides po&s;t every &s;abbath from village to village,
and mounts and di&s;mounts at the church-door. The clerk's office is not only
to tag the prayers with an <HI>Amen,</HI> or u&s;her in the &s;ermon with a
&s;tave; but he is al&s;o the univer&s;al <PB N="809" REF="384"> father to give
away the brides, and the &s;tanding god|father to all the new-born brats. But
in many places there is a &s;till greater man belonging to the church, than
either the par&s;on or the clerk him&s;elf. The per&s;on I mean is the
&s;quire; who, like the King, may be &s;tiled Head of the Church in his own
pari&s;h. If the benefice be in his own gift, the vicar is his creature, and of
con|&s;equence entirely at his devotion: or, if the care of the church is left
to a curate, the Sunday fees of roa&s;t beef and plumb pudding, and a liberty
to &s;hoot in the manor, will bring him as much under the &s;quire's command as
his dogs and hor&s;es. For this rea&s;on the bell is often kept tolling, and
the people waiting in the church-yard, an hour longer than the u&s;ual time;
nor mu&s;t the &s;ervice begin, till the &s;quire has &s;trutted up the ayle,
and &s;eated him&s;elf in the great pew in the chancel. The length of the
&s;ermon is al&s;o mea&s;ured by the will of the &s;quire, as formerly by the
hour-gla&s;s: and I know one pari&s;h where the preacher has always the
complai&s;ance to break off to a conclu&s;ion, the minute that the &s;quire
gives the &s;ignal by ri&s;ing up after his nap.</P>
<P>IN a village church, the &s;quire's lady or the vicar's wife
are perhaps the only females that are &s;tared at for their finery: but in the
larger cities and towns, where the newe&s;t fa&s;hions are brought down weekly
by the &s;tage-coach or waggon, all the wives and daughters of the mo&s;t
topping trade&s;men vie with each other every Sunday in the elegance of their
apparel. I could even trace the gradations in their dre&s;s according to the
opu|lence, the extent, and the di&s;tance of the place from <HI>London.</HI> I
was at church in a populous city in the north, where the mace-bearer cleared
the way for Mrs. Mayore&s;s, <PB N="810" REF="385"> who came &s;idling after
him in an enormous fan-hoop, of a pattern which had never been &s;een before in
tho&s;e parts. At another church in a corporation-town, I &s;aw &s;everal
Neglige&egrave;s, with furbelow'd aprons, which had long di&s;|puted the prize
of &s;uperiority: but the&s;e were mo&s;t woe|fully eclip&s;ed by a burge&s;s's
daughter ju&s;t come from <HI>London,</HI> who appeared in a Trolloppe&egrave;
or Slammerkin, with treble ruffles to the cuffs, pinked and gymped, and the
&s;ides of the petticoat drawn up in fe&s;toons. In &s;ome le&s;&s;er borough
towns the conte&s;t, I found, lay between three or four black and green bibs
and aprons: at one a grocer's wife attracted our eyes by a new-fa&s;hioned cap
called a Joan; and at another they were wholly taken up by a mercer's daughter
in a Nun's Hood.</P>
<P>I NEED not &s;ay any thing of the behaviour of the
con|gregations in the&s;e more polite places of religious re&s;ort; as the
&s;ame genteel ceremonies are practi&s;ed there as at the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable
churches at the court end of the town. The ladies immediately on their entrance
breathe a pious ejaculation through their fan-&s;ticks, and the beaus very
gravely addre&s;s them&s;elves to the Haberda&s;hers' Bills glewed upon the
linings of their hats. This pious duty is no &s;ooner performed, than the
exerci&s;e of bowing and curt&s;ying &s;ucceeds; the locking and unlocking of
the pews drowns the reader's voice at the beginning of the &s;ervice, and the
ru&s;tling of &s;ilks, added to the whi&s;pering and tittering of &s;o much
good company, renders him totally unintelligible to the very end of it.</P>

<P>_I Am &s;orry to have provoked the re&s;ent|ment of many of our

<P>_WE, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to write loo&s;e e&s;&s;ays, and
who never talk above a quarter of an hour together on any one &s;ubject, are
not expected to enter into philo&s;ophical di&s;qui&s;itions, or en|gage in
ab&s;tract &s;peculations: but it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be our principal aim to
amu&s;e and in&s;truct the reader by a lively repre&s;entation of what
pa&s;&s;es round about him. Thus, like tho&s;e painters who delineate the 
<PB N="818" REF="393"> &s;cenes of familiar life, we &s;ometimes give a
&s;ketch of a Marriage <HI>&agrave; l&agrave; mode,</HI> &s;ometimes draw the
outlines of a Modern Midnight conver&s;ation, at another time paint the comical
di&s;tre&s;&s;es of itinerant Tragedians in a barn, and at another give a full
draught of the Rake's or Harlot's progre&s;s. Sometimes we divert the public by
exhibiting &s;ingle portraits; and when we meet with a &s;ubject where the
features are &s;trongly marked by nature, and there is &s;omething peculiarly
characteri&s;tic in the whole manner, we employ our&s;elves in drawing a full
length. In a word, we con&s;ider all mankind as &s;itting for their pictures,
and endeavour to work up our pieces with lively traits, and embelli&s;h them
with beautiful colouring: and though perhaps they are not always highly
fini&s;hed, yet they &s;eldom fail of plea&s;ing &s;ome few at lea&s;t of the
va&s;t multitude of Critics and Con|noi&s;&s;eurs, if we are &s;o happy as to
hit off a &s;triking likene&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE is perhaps no knowledge more requi&s;ite, and certainly
none at pre&s;ent more ardently &s;ought after, than the Knowledge of the
World. In this &s;cience we are more particularly expected to be adepts, as
well as to ini|tiate, or at lea&s;t improve our readers in it. And though this
knowledge cannot be collected altogether from books, yet (as <HI>Pope</HI>
&s;ays) 
<Q REND="inline">"Men may be read as well as books too much;"</Q>
and it is to be lamented, that many, who have only con&s;ulted the volume of
life as it lay open be|fore them, have rather become wor&s;e than better by
their &s;tudies. They, who have lived wholly in the world <PB N="819" REF="394"> without regarding the comments on it, are generally taint|ed with
all its vices; to which the gathering part of their in&s;tructions from books
would perhaps have proved an antidote. There indeed, though they would have
&s;een the faults and foibles of mankind fairly repre&s;ented, yet vice would
appear in an odious, and virtue in an amiable light; but tho&s;e, who unwarned
go abroad into the world, are often dazzled by the &s;plendor with which wealth
gilds vice and infamy, and being accu&s;tomed to &s;ee bare|foot hone&s;ty
treated with &s;corn, are them&s;elves induced to con&s;ider it as
contemptible. For this rea&s;on I am a good deal offended at the ingenious
contrivance of our modern novelli&s;ts and writers of comedy, who often glo&s;s
over a villainous character with the &s;ame fal&s;e varni&s;h, that lackers
&s;o many &s;coundrels in real life; and while they are exhibiting a fellow,
who debauches your daugh|ter or lies with your wife, repre&s;ent him as an
agreeable creature, a man of gallantry, and a fine gentleman.</P>
<P>THE world, even the gaye&s;t part of it, may be paint|ed like
it&s;elf, and yet become a le&s;&s;on of in&s;truction. The pieces of
<HI>Hogarth</HI> (to recur to the illu&s;tration I fir&s;t made u&s;e of) are
faithful delineations of certain &s;cenes of life, and yet vice and folly
always appear odious and contem|ptible. I could wi&s;h it were po&s;&s;ible to
learn the know|ledge of the world without being 
<Q REND="inline">"hackney'd in the ways of men;"</Q> but as that
is impracticable, it is &s;till our duty &s;o to live in it, as to avoid being
corrupted by our intercour&s;e with mankind. We &s;hould endeavour to guard
again&s;t fraud, without becoming our&s;elves deceit|ful; <PB N="820" REF="395"> and to &s;ee every &s;pecies of vice and folly practi&s;ed round
about us, without growing knaves and fools. The villainy of others is but a
poor excu&s;e for the lo&s;s of our own integrity; and though, indeed, if I am
attacked on <HI>Houn&s;low-Heath,</HI> I may lawfully kill the highwayman in my
own defence, yet I &s;hould be very de&s;ervedly brought to the gallows, if I
took a pur&s;e from the next per&s;on I met, becau&s;e I had been robbed
my&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE Knowledge of the World, as it is generally un|der&s;tood,
con&s;i&s;ts not &s;o much in a due reflection on its vices and follies, as in
the practice of them; and tho&s;e, who con&s;ider them&s;elves as be&s;t
acquainted with it, are either the dupes of fa&s;hion, or &s;laves of
intere&s;t. It is al|&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed to lie within the narrow compa&s;s of
every man's own &s;phere of life, and receives a different interpre|tation in
different &s;tations. Thus, for in&s;tance, the man of fa&s;hion &s;eeks it
no-where but in the polite circle of the <HI>beau-monde,</HI> while the man of
bu&s;ine&s;s looks no farther for it than the <HI>Alley.</HI> I &s;hall beg
leave to illu&s;trate this by two characters; each of whom, though
diametrically op|po&s;ite to the other, has acquired a thorough Knowledge of
the World.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Harry Fla&s;h</HI> had the good luck to be born be|fore
his brother <HI>Richard:</HI> con&s;equently the heir to the e&s;tate was bred
a gentleman, and the other condemned to plod in the dull drudgery of
bu&s;ine&s;s. The merchant was &s;ent to learn accompts at the Academy upon
<HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> and the baronet had the fini&s;hing of his education in 
<PB N="821" REF="396"> <HI>France.</HI> Sir <HI>Harry</HI> is now a mo&s;t
accompli&s;hed fine gentleman, is an excellent judge of fa&s;hions, and can
cal|culate the odds at any game as readily as <HI>Hoyle</HI> or
<HI>De|moivre:</HI> the Alderman is the mo&s;t knowing man upon
<HI>'Change,</HI> and under&s;tands the ri&s;e and fall of Stocks bet|ter than
any <HI>Jew.</HI> Both of them know the world; but with this difference, that
one by his con&s;ummate know|ledge has run out a large e&s;tate, while the
other has rai&s;ed a plumb by it.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, it will be proper to take notice of the great
improvements made by our modern ladies in this part of their education. The
pretty creatures were formerly kept at home, and employed in the dome&s;tic
cares of good hou&s;ewifery: they were taught as much as po&s;&s;ible to &s;hun
the company of the men, and knew no more of the world than a cloi&s;tered Nun.
But the&s;e re&s;traints are now happily removed by the pre&s;ent mode of
education. The little lady, in&s;tead of being &s;ent to the boarding-&s;chool
to learn needle-work, is introduced to the polite&s;t routs and a&s;&s;emblies,
and taught to make one at the card-table: &s;he is carried about to
<HI>Vauxhall, Rane|lagh,</HI> and other genteel places of amu&s;ement; and
be&s;ides the&s;e, if we add a trip to <HI>Bath</HI> or <HI>Cheltenham,</HI>
there is no doubt but &s;he is completely ver&s;ed in the Knowledge of the
World. This, we mu&s;t own, is very nece&s;&s;ary to be attained by ladies of
fa&s;hion: but it is with great concern that I have ob&s;erved the inferior
rank of females fre|quenting the &s;ame &s;chools, and learning the &s;ame
le&s;&s;ons. Some have purcha&s;ed their knowledge very dearly at the 
<PB N="822" REF="397"> expence of their reputation, while others have laid out
their whole fortunes to acquire it; and I could not but &s;mile the other day
at reading an adverti&s;ement in the public papers, begging our charity for a
poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed gentlewoman, who had formerly lived well, and &s;een a
great deal of the World.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">_WHAT cloying meat is love, when ma|trimony is
the &s;auce to it!"</Q> &s;ays Sir <HI>John Brute.</HI> But if he had been
joined to &s;uch an <HI>Epicurean</HI> con&s;ort as I, tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions
that favour of the kitchen would have been real, in&s;tead of metaphorical. We
live in a land really flowing with milk and honey, and keep a hou&s;e of
entertainment for all comers and goers. We <PB N="824" REF="399"> hardly ever
&s;it down to table le&s;s in number than twenty or thirty, and very often to
above double that number of di&s;hes. In &s;hort, &s;ir, &s;o much fea&s;ting
has given me a &s;urfeit.</P>
<P>THERE are, I &s;ee, &s;cattered up and down your pa|pers,
&s;everal accounts of the petty di&s;tre&s;&s;es and dome&s;tic concerns of
private families. As you have li&s;tened to many complaints from hu&s;bands, I
flatter my&s;elf you will not refu&s;e your attention to the humble
remon&s;trance of a wife; being a&s;&s;ured, that my only rea&s;on for thus
&s;erv|ing up my dear lord as a new di&s;h to gratify the public ta&s;te, is to
check (if po&s;&s;ible) his violent pa&s;&s;ion for give|ing his friends
entertainments of another kind; which, if indulged much longer, mu&s;t eat us
out of hou&s;e and home.</P>
<P>THE magnificent fea&s;ts of <HI>Timon</HI> of <HI>Athens,</HI>
or the &s;to|ries of old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ho&s;pitality, would give you but a
faint idea of the perpetual riot and luxury of our family. Our hou&s;e is
always &s;tored with as large a quantity of provi&s;i|ons as a garri&s;on in
expectation of a &s;iege, and tho&s;e too of the deare&s;t and mo&s;t
extravagant kind. Ortolans and woodcocks are as plenty as &s;parrows, and red
mullets are &s;carce a greater rarity with us than gudgeons or &s;prats; while
turtle and veni&s;on are regarded as branches of ci|tizen-luxury, which
&s;carce de&s;erve notice among the ma|ny other delicacies in which we abound.
Authors, they &s;ay, (you will pardon me, Mr. TOWN,) are &s;eldom ad|mitted to
great entertainments; and I can a&s;&s;ure you, that it is not ea&s;y for any,
but tho&s;e who are pre&s;ent, to conceive the parade and extravagance
di&s;played in our hou&s;e. I my&s;elf am condemned to &s;it at the head of the
<PB N="825" REF="400"> table, while my lord is placed at the other end, in pain
and unea&s;ine&s;s at my aukward mi&s;takes in <HI>doing the ho|nours.</HI> You
mu&s;t know, &s;ir, that I was bred up under an hou&s;ewifely aunt in the
country, who taught me to pickle and pre&s;erve, and gave me, as I thought, a
tole|rable notion of cookery. But, alas! though I under|&s;tand plain boiled
and roa&s;t, and have a very good notion of a pudding, I am often totally
ignorant of the names and compo&s;itions of the delicacies before me, and have
imagined fi&s;h to be fowl, and mi&s;taken a <HI>petit pate&egrave;</HI> for a
plebeian mince-pie. In the mean time my lord is di&s;|playing his exqui&s;ite
ta&s;te by deciding upon every di&s;h, and pronouncing with a critical &s;mack
upon the flavour of the wines; all the while not a little &s;olicitous about
the exactne&s;s of the Removes, and the duly adju&s;ting the
<HI>entremets.</HI> Claret, Burgundy, and Champagne are as common as ale or
&s;mall-beer; and even Hermitage and Tokay are &s;wallowed with as little
remor&s;e as Port of Li&s;|bon. To add to all this, is mo&s;t ab&s;urdly
introduced the <HI>French</HI> cu&s;tom of &s;erving in <HI>les Liqueurs,</HI>
which con&s;i&s;t of almo&s;t as many &s;orts as are contained in the
adverti&s;ements from the Rich Cordial Warehou&s;e. In a word, every common
dinner with us is a fea&s;t; and when we have what my lord calls an
entertainment, it is an ab&s;olute de|bauch.</P>
<P>BUT there is no part of this mon&s;trous expence af|fects me
&s;o much as the va&s;t &s;ums ridiculou&s;ly lavi&s;hed on a De&s;ert. This
piece of folly and extravagance could be nothing but the joint product of a
<HI>Frenchman</HI> and a con|fectioner. After the gratification of the appetite
with more &s;ub&s;tantial fare, this whipt-&s;yllabub raree-&s;hew is &s;erved
up chiefly to feed the eye; not but that the mate|rials, <PB N="826" REF="401">
of which the De&s;ert is compo&s;ed, are as expen&s;ive as the &s;everal
ingredients in the dinner: and I will leave you to your own method of rating
the re&s;t, after telling you that my lord thinks him&s;elf an excellent
oecono|mi&s;t, by having reduced the expence of the Hot-Hou&s;e to a thou&s;and
<HI>per ann.</HI> which perhaps the admirers of exotic fruits will not think
dear, as we have pine-apples as plenty as golden-pippins or nonpareils.</P>
<P>ONE would think, that the fir&s;t requi&s;ite in eating was
extravagance, and that in order to have any thing very good, it mu&s;t be eat
at a time that it is out of &s;ea&s;on. Therefore one of the principal u&s;es
of our Hot-Hou&s;e is to invert the order of nature, and to turn winter into
&s;ummer. We &s;hould be a&s;hamed to &s;ee peas upon our table, while they are
to be had at a common market; but we never &s;pare any co&s;t to provide a good
crop by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our hot-beds at <HI>Chri&s;tmas.</HI> We have
no reli&s;h for cucumbers during the &s;ummer months, when they are no rarity;
but we take care to have them forced in <HI>November.</HI> But my lord mo&s;tly
prides him&s;elf on the improvements that he has made in his Mu&s;hroom-Beds,
which he has at length brought to &s;o great perfection, that by the help of
hor&s;e-dung, and throwing artificial &s;un-beams through a burning-gla&s;s, we
can rai&s;e any quantity of Mu&s;hrooms of the right <HI>Italian</HI> kind at
two hours warning.</P>
<P>FROM the Hot-Hou&s;e we may make a very natural tran&s;ition
to the Kitchen; and as in the former every thing mu&s;t be produced out of
&s;ea&s;on, &s;o every thing in the latter mu&s;t undergo a &s;trange
metamorpho&s;is. The ordinary di&s;tinctions of fi&s;h, fle&s;h, and fowl are
quite <PB N="827" REF="402"> de&s;troyed; and nothing comes upon table under
its proper form and appellation. It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive what va&s;t
&s;ums are melted down into &s;auces! We have a cargo of hams every year from
<HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> only to ex|tract the <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of them for
our &s;oups; and we kill a brace of bucks every week, to make a <HI>Cullis</HI>
of the haunches. Half a dozen turkies have been killed in one day merely for
the &s;ake of the pinions; and I have known a whole pond dragged to furni&s;h a
di&s;h of Carps' Palates, and ten legs of mutton mangled raw to make out a
di&s;h of Pope's Eyes.</P>
<P>THE concomitant charges of the cellar, you will ima|gine, are
no le&s;s extravagant; and, indeed, it is not enough that we abound in the
be&s;t <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> wines, (which by the bye are
purcha&s;ed on the &s;pot at an extraordinary price,) but we mu&s;t have
&s;everal other kinds of the highe&s;t value, and con&s;equently a mo&s;t
delicious flavour. And though but a ta&s;te of each has been &s;ipped round by
the company, the &s;ame bottles mu&s;t never be brought a &s;econd time upon
table, but are &s;ecured as perqui&s;ites by the butler, who fells them to the
merchant, who &s;ells them back again to my lord. Be&s;ides the&s;e, his
lord&s;hip has lately been at an immen&s;e charge in rai&s;ing a Pinery, in
order to try the experiment of making Cyder of Pine-apples; which he hopes to
do at little more than treble the expence of Champagne. To this article I might
al&s;o add the charge of his Ice-Hou&s;es: for although the&s;e are &s;tored
with an home-commodity originally of no value, yet I may
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> to &s;ay, that every drop of
water comes as dear to us as the mo&s;t co&s;tly of our wines.</P>
<P><PB N="828" REF="403">AS all our liquors, I have told you, are
of foreign growth, and all our di&s;hes di&s;tingui&s;hed by foreign titles,
you will readily conceive, that our hou&s;hold is chiefly compo&s;ed of
foreigners. The butler out of livery, and his two under-butlers, are
<HI>Frenchmen:</HI> the clerk of the kitchen is a <HI>Frenchman:</HI> and
<HI>Mon&s;ieur Fri|cando,</HI> the head-cook, to be &s;ure is a
<HI>Frenchman.</HI> This gentleman never &s;oils his fingers in touching the
lea&s;t bit of any thing, but gives his orders (like a general) to four
&s;ubalterns, who are likewi&s;e <HI>Frenchmen.</HI> The baker, the
confectioner, the very &s;cullions, and even the fellow that looks after the
poultry, are all of them <HI>Frenchmen.</HI> The&s;e, you may be &s;ure, are
maintained at very high &s;alaries: and though <HI>Mon&s;ieur Fricando</HI> had
the pay of a captain in a marching regiment, my lord was forced to double his
wages at the beginning of the war, and allow him the free exerci&s;e of his
<HI>religion,</HI> to prevent his leaving the kingdom.</P>
<P>I AM &s;orry to add, that this pride of keeping a table has
vi&s;ibly impaired my lord's fortunes: and this very &s;ummer he has been
obliged to fell all the timber on his e&s;tate, as I may &s;ay, to keep up his
kitchen fire. The only &s;atisfaction he can po&s;&s;ibly reap from all this
ex|pence is the vanity of having it &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"that no-body treats &s;o elegantly as his
lord&s;hip,"</Q> and now and then perhaps reading in the news-papers, 
<Q REND="inline">"that &s;uch a day the right honourable
&mdash; gave a grand entertainment at his hou&s;e in &mdash;, at which were

<P>_IN the comedy of the <HI>Frenchman in Lon|don,</HI> which we
are told was acted at <HI>Paris</HI> with univer&s;al applau&s;e for &s;everal
nights together, there is a character of a rough <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who is
repre&s;ented as quite un&s;killed in the graces of conver&s;ation; and his
dialogue is made up of almo&s;t nothing but a repetition of the common
&s;alutation of <HI>how do you do, how do you do?</HI> Our nation has, indeed,
been generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be of a &s;ullen and uncommunicative
di&s;po&s;ition; while, on <PB N="830" REF="405"> the other hand, the
loquacious <HI>French</HI> have been allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the art of
conver&s;ing beyond all other people. The <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> requires to be
wound up frequently, and &s;tops as &s;oon as he is down; but the
<HI>Frenchman</HI> runs on in a continued alarum. Yet it mu&s;t be
acknow|ledged, that as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;i&s;t of very different
hu|mours, their manner of di&s;cour&s;e admits of great variety: but the whole
<HI>French</HI> nation conver&s;e alike; and there is no difference in their
addre&s;s between a <HI>Marquis</HI> and a <HI>Valet de Chambre.</HI> We may
frequently &s;ee a couple of <HI>French</HI> barbers acco&s;ting each other in
the &s;treet, and paying their compliments with the &s;ame volubility of
&s;peech and grimace of action, as two courtiers in the
<HI>Thuilleries.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL not attempt to lay down any particular rules for
conver&s;ation, but point out &s;uch faults in the di&s;cour&s;e and behaviour,
as render the company of half mankind rather tedious than amu&s;ing. It is in
vain, indeed, to look for conver&s;ation, where we might expect to find it in
the greate&s;t perfection, among per&s;ons of fa&s;hion; where it is almo&s;t
annihilated by univer&s;al card-playing: in&s;omuch that I have heard it given
as a rea&s;on, why it is impo&s;&s;ible for our pre&s;ent writers to &s;ucceed
in the dialogue of genteel comedy, that our people of quality &s;carce ever
meet but to game. All their di&s;cour&s;e turns upon the odd trick and the four
honours: and it is no le&s;s a maxim with the votaries of Whi&s;t than with
tho&s;e of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> that talking &s;poils company. Every one
endeavours to make him&s;elf as agreeable to &s;ociety as he can: but it often
happens, that tho&s;e, who mo&s;t aim at &s;hining in conver&s;ation,
over-&s;hoot their mark: and though a man &s;ucceeds, he &s;hould not (as is
frequently <PB N="831" REF="406"> the ca&s;e) engro&s;s the whole talk to
him&s;elf; for that de&s;troys the very e&s;&s;ence of conver&s;ation, which is
talk|ing together. We &s;hould try to keep up conver&s;ation like a ball
bandied to and fro from one to the other, rather than &s;eize it all to
our&s;elves, and drive it before us like a foot-ball. We &s;hould likewi&s;e be
cautious to adapt the matter of our di&s;cour&s;e to our company; and not talk
<HI>Greek</HI> before the ladies, or of the la&s;t new furbelow to a meeting of
country ju&s;tices.</P>
<P>THE pe&s;ts and nui&s;ances of &s;ociety, which are com|monly to
be met with, may be ranged in the following manner. And fir&s;t, the
Attitudinarians and Face-makers. The&s;e accompany every word with a peculiar
grimace or ge&s;ture: they a&s;&s;ent with a &s;hrug, and contradict with a
twi&s;ting of the neck; are angry with a wry mouth, and plea&s;ed in a caper or
a minuet &s;tep. They may be con&s;idered as &s;peaking Harlequins; and their
rules of eloquence are taken from the po&s;ture-ma&s;ter. The&s;e &s;hould be
condemned to conver&s;e only in dumb &s;hew with their own per&s;ons in the
looking-gla&s;s; as al&s;o the Smirkers and Smilers, who &s;o prettily &s;et
off their faces together with their words by a <HI>je ne &s;&ccedil;ai
quoi</HI> between a grin and a dimple. With the&s;e we may likewi&s;e rank the
affected tribe of Mimics, who are con&s;tantly taking off the peculiar tone of
voice or ge&s;ture of their ac|quaintance: though they 
<Q REND="inline">"imitate humanity &s;o abomi|nably,"</Q> that
(like bad painters) they are frequently forced to write the name under the
picture, before we can di&s;cover any likene&s;s.</P>
<P>NEXT to the&s;e, who&s;e elocution con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the
action, we may con&s;ider the profe&s;t &s;peakers. And fir&s;t, 
<PB N="832" REF="407"> of the Emphatical; who &s;queeze, and pre&s;s, and beat
down every &s;yllable with as much vehemence, as a paviour thumps the pebbles
with his rammer. The&s;e energetic orators are remarkable for the force of
expre&s;&s;ion, with which they utter the particle <HI>the</HI> and conjunctive
<HI>and</HI>; which they &s;eem to hawk up with much difficulty out of their
own throats, and to cram them with no le&s;s pain in|to the ears of their
auditors. The&s;e &s;hould be &s;uffered only to &s;yringe (as it were) the
ears of a deaf man through an hearing trumpet: and with the&s;e we may join the
Whi&s;perers or Low Speakers, who come up &s;o clo&s;e to you, that they may be
&s;aid to mea&s;ure no&s;es with you, and have frequently a &s;tinking breath.
I would have the&s;e oracular gentry obliged to talk at a di&s;tance through a
&s;peaking trumpet, or apply their lips to the walls of a whi&s;pering gallery.
The Wits, who will not conde&s;cend to utter any thing but a <HI>bon mot,</HI>
and the Whi&s;tlers or Tune-hummers, who never articulate at all, may be joined
very agreeably together in concert: and to the&s;e tinkling cymbals I would
al&s;o add the &s;ounding bra&s;s; the Bawler, who inquires after your health
with the bellowing of a town-cryer.</P>
<P>THE Tatlers, who&s;e pliable pipes are admirably adapt|ed to the

<Q REND="inline">"&s;oft parts of conver&s;ation,"</Q> and
&s;weetly 
<Q REND="inline">"prattling out of fa&s;hion,"</Q> make very
pretty mu&s;ick from a beautiful face and a female tongue: but from a rough
manly voice and coar&s;e features it is as har&s;h and di&s;&s;onant as a jig
from a bagpipe. The Half-Swearers, who &s;plit, and mince, and fritter their
oaths into <HI>gad's bud, ad's fi&s;h</HI> and <HI>demmee,</HI> and the
Humbuggers, and tho&s;e who nickname God's creatures, who call a man a
cab|bage, a crab, a queer cub, an odd fi&s;h, and an unac|countable 
<PB N="833" REF="408"> mu&s;kin, &s;hould never come into company with|out an
interpeter. But I &s;hall not tire my reader's pa|tience by pointing out
others, no le&s;s de&s;tructive of &s;o|ciety: &s;uch as the Sen&s;ibles, who
pronounce dogmatical|ly on the mo&s;t trivial points, and &s;peak in
&s;entences; the Wonderers, who are always <HI>wondering</HI> what o'clock it
is, or <HI>wondering</HI> whether it will rain or no, or <HI>wondering</HI>
when the moon changes; and la&s;tly, the Silent Men, who &s;eem afraid of
opening their mouths for fear of catch|ing cold, and literally ob&s;erve the
precept of the go&s;pel, by letting their conver&s;ation be only <HI>yea
yea,</HI> and <HI>nay nay.</HI></P>
<P>THE rational intercour&s;e, which is mutually kept up among men
by conver&s;ing with each other, is one of our principal di&s;tinctions from
brutes: and it is imagined by &s;ome philo&s;ophers, that birds and bea&s;ts
(though with|out the power of articulation) perfectly under&s;tand one another
by the &s;ounds they utter; and that dogs, cats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have each a
particular language to them&s;elves, like different nations. Thus it may be
&s;uppo&s;ed, that the nightingales of <HI>Italy</HI> have as fine an ear for
their own na|tive wood-notes, as any <HI>Signor</HI> or <HI>Signora</HI> for an
<HI>Italian Air;</HI> that the boars of <HI>We&s;tphalia</HI> gruntle as
expre&s;&s;ively through the no&s;e, as the inhabitants in
<HI>High-German</HI>; and that the frogs in the dykes of <HI>Holland</HI> croak
as intelligibly as the natives jabber their <HI>High-Dutch.</HI> However this
may be, we may con&s;ider tho&s;e, who let their tongues always vibrate as
their hearts beat, and do not keep up the proper conver&s;ation of human
creatures, as imitating the language of different animals. Thus, for
in&s;tance, the affinity between Chatterers and Monkeys, and Praters and
Parrots, is too obvious not to occur at once: Grunters <PB N="834" REF="409">
and Growlers may be ju&s;tly compared to Hogs: Snarlers are Curs, that
continually &s;hew their teeth, but never bite; and the Spitfire Pa&s;&s;ionate
are a &s;ort of wild Cats, that will not bear &s;troaking, but will purr when
they are plea&s;ed. Complainers are Scriech-Owls; and Story-tel|lers, who are
always repeating the &s;ame dull note, are Cuckows. Poets, that prick up their
ears at their own hideous braying, are no better than A&s;&s;es: Critics in
gene|ral are venomous &s;erpents, that delight in hi&s;&s;ing; and &s;ome of
them, who have got by heart a few technical terms without knowing their
meaning, are no other than Magpies. I my&s;elf, who have crowed to the whole
town for near three years pa&s;t, may perhaps put my readers in mind of a
Dunghill Cock: but as I mu&s;t acquaint them, that they will hear the la&s;t of
me on this day fortnight, I hope they will then con&s;ider me as a Swan, who is
&s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ing &s;weetly at his dying moments.</P>

<P>_I WROTE to my Cou&s;in VILLAGE, informing him of my de&s;ign to
fini&s;h with the next number; and I have re|ceived the following an&s;wer from
him, which I &s;hall lay before my readers.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was not without &s;ome regret, that I received advice of
your intentions to bid adieu to the public: for as you had been &s;o kind as to
introduce me to their notice, I began to indulge all the weakne&s;s and vanity
of a young author; and had almo&s;t per&s;uaded my&s;elf, that I was the
principal &s;upport of your papers. Con&s;cious of my own importance, I expect
that you will do me the ju&s;tice to acknowledge, how much you are indebted to
the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance <PB N="836" REF="411"> of your very ingenious Cou&s;in;
and I care not how many compliments you pay me on my wit and learning: but at
the &s;ame time I mu&s;t beg leave to put in a caveat again&s;t your
di&s;po&s;ing of me in what manner you your&s;elf plea&s;e. Writers of
e&s;&s;ays think them&s;elves at liberty to do what they will with the
characters they have introduced into their works: as writers of tragedy, in
order to heighten the plot, have brought their heroes to an untimely end, when
they have died quietly many years before in their beds; or as our chroniclers
of daily occurrences put a duke to death, give away an heire&s;s in marriage,
or &s;hoot off an admiral's legs, whenever they plea&s;e. Mr. ADDISON, while he
was carrying on the SPECTATOR, &s;aid 
<Q REND="inline">"he would kill Sir <HI>Roger de Coverly,</HI>
that nobody el&s;e might murder him:"</Q> In like manner, my dear Cou&s;in, you
may perhaps take it into your head to cut me off: you may make an end of me by
a cold caught in partridge-&s;hooting, or break my neck in a &s;tag|hunt. Or
you may rather chu&s;e to &s;ettle me perhaps with a rich old country dowager,
or pre&s;s me into the army, or clap me on board of a man of war. But I
de&s;ire that you will not get rid of me by any of the&s;e means: but permit me
to a&s;&s;ure your readers, that I am alive and merry; and this is to let them
know, that I am in good health at this pre&s;ent writing.</P>
<P>YOUR papers, I a&s;&s;ure you, have made a great noi&s;e in
the country; and the mo&s;t intelligent among us read you with as much
&s;atisfaction as the <HI>Evening Po&s;ts</HI> or the <HI>Weekly Journals.</HI>
I know more than one &s;quire, who who takes them in con&s;tantly with the
<HI>Magazines</HI>; and I was told by the po&s;t-ma&s;ter of a certain town,
that they came down every week under cover to the but|ler of a member of
parliament. There is a club of country par&s;ons, who meet every
<HI>Saturday</HI> at a neigh|bouring market-town, to be &s;haved and exchange
&s;er|mons: they have a &s;ub&s;cription for books and pamphlets; and the only
periodical works ordered in by them are <PB N="837" REF="412"> the
<HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur,</HI> and the <HI>Critical</HI> and <HI>Monthly
Reviews.</HI> I was lately introduced to this &s;ociety, when the
conver|&s;ation happened to turn upon Mr. TOWN. A young curate, ju&s;t come
from <HI>Oxford,</HI> &s;aid he knew you very well at <HI>Chri&s;t Church,</HI>
and that you was a comical dog: but a <HI>Cantab.</HI> declared no le&s;s
po&s;itively, that you was either a pensioner of <HI>Trinity</HI> or a commoner
of <HI>Bennet</HI>'s. People, indeed, are very much perplexed about the real
author: &s;ome affirm, that you are a nobleman; and others will have it, that
you are an actor: &s;ome &s;ay you are a young lawyer, &s;ome a par&s;on, and
&s;ome an old woman.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubjects of your papers have often been wre&s;ted to
various interpretations by our penetrating geniu&s;&s;es; and you have hardly
drawn a character, that has not been fixed on one or other of the greate&s;t
per&s;onages in the nation. I once heard a country ju&s;tice expre&s;s his
won|der, that you was not taken up, and &s;et in the pillory; and I my&s;elf,
by &s;ome of my rural intelligence, have brought upon you the re&s;entment of
&s;everal hone&s;t &s;quires, who long to hor&s;e-whip the &s;coundrel for
putting them in print. Others again are quite at a lo&s;s how to pick out your
meaning, and in vain turn over their <HI>Bailey</HI>'s dictio|nary for an
explanation of &s;everal fa&s;hionable phra&s;es; which, though they have
enriched the town-language, have not yet made their way into the dialect of the
coun|try. Many exqui&s;ite &s;trokes of humour are al&s;o lo&s;t upon us, on
account of our di&s;tance from the &s;cene of action; and the wit, which is
very bri&s;k and lively upon the &s;pot, lo&s;es much of its &s;pirit in the
carriage, and &s;ometimes wholly evaporates in the po&s;t-bag.</P>
<P>YOU morali&s;ts are very apt to flatter your&s;elves, that you
are doing a va&s;t deal of good by your labours: but whatever reformation you
may have worked in town, give me leave to tell you, that you have &s;ometimes
done us harm in the country, by the bare mention of the vices 
<PB N="838" REF="413"> and follies now in vogue. From your intelligence &s;ome
of our mo&s;t polite ladies have learned, that it is highly genteel to have a
route; and &s;ome have copied the fa&s;hion &s;o exactly, as to play at cards
on <HI>Sundays.</HI> Your papers upon dre&s;s &s;et all our belles at work in
following the mode: you no &s;ooner took notice of the cocked hats, but every
hat in the pari&s;h was turned up behind and be|fore; and when you told us,
that the town-beauties went naked, our rural dam&s;els immediately began to
throw off their cloaths. Our gentlemen have been al&s;o taught by you all the
new arts of betting and gaming: and the only coffee-hou&s;e in one little town,
where the mo&s;t topping inhabitants are u&s;ed to meet to play at draughts and
back-gammon, has, from the great increa&s;e of game&s;ters who re&s;ort to it,
been elegantly chri&s;tened by the name of <HI>White</HI>'s.</P>
<P>AS to the &s;mall &s;hare, which I my&s;elf have had in your
work, you may be &s;ure every body here is hugely delighted with it; at lea&s;t
you may be &s;ure, that I will &s;ay nothing to the contrary. I have done my
be&s;t to contribute to the entertainment of your readers: and as the name of
<HI>Steele</HI> is not forgot in the SPECTATOR, though <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> has
run away with almo&s;t all the honour, I am in hopes that whenever the great
Mr. TOWN is mentioned, they may po&s;&s;ibly think at the &s;ame time on</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your affectionate Cou&s;in and Coadjutor,
VILLAGE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>AFTER this account, which my Cou&s;in has &s;ent me, of the
reception I have met with in the country, it will be proper to &s;ay
&s;omething of my reception here in town. I &s;hall therefore con&s;ider
my&s;elf in the threefold capacity of CONNOISSEUR, CRITIC, and CENSOR-GENERAL.
As a CONNOISSEUR, in the confined &s;en&s;e of the word, I mu&s;t own I have
met with &s;everal mortifications. I have neither been made F. R. S. nor even a
member of the Academy of <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> or <HI>Peter&s;burgh.</HI> They
have left <PB N="839" REF="414"> me out of the li&s;t of Tru&s;tees to the
<HI>Briti&s;h Mu&s;aeum</HI>; and his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Naples,</HI> though he
pre&s;ented an "Account of the Curio&s;ities found in <HI>Herculaneum</HI>" to
each of the univer&s;ities, never &s;ent one to me. I have not been celebrated
in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, or in any of our Magazines of Arts and
Sciences; nor have I been &s;tiled <HI>tres-illu&s;tre</HI> or
<HI>tres-&s;&ccedil;avant</HI> in any of the fo|reign <HI>Mercures</HI> or
<HI>Journals Literaires.</HI> Once indeed, I &s;oothed my&s;elf in the vain
thought of having been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the great <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI>
Botani&s;t, <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> under the title of <HI>Eruditi&s;&s;imus
Urbanus,</HI> which I conceited to be the name of TOWN latinized; but to my
great di&s;ap|pointment I afterwards di&s;covered, that this was no other than
the learned Naturali&s;t, Mr. <HI>Silvanus Urban,</HI> author of the
<HI>Gentleman's Magazine.</HI> This neglect of me, as a CONNOISSEUR, I can
attribute to no other cau&s;e, than to my not having made my&s;elf known by my
<HI>Mu&s;aeum</HI> or Cabinet of Curio&s;ities: and to &s;ay the truth, I am
not worth a farthing in antique coins; nor have I &s;o much as one &s;ingle
&s;hell or butterfly. All my complaints again&s;t the modern innovations of
Ta&s;te have been therefore di&s;regarded: and with concern I &s;till &s;ee the
Villas of our citizens fanta&s;tically adorned with <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> palings,
and our &s;treets encumbered with &s;uperb colonnades, porticos,
<HI>Gothic</HI> arches, and <HI>Venetian</HI> windows, before the &s;hops of
our trade&s;men.</P>
<P>NOR have I, as a CRITIC, met with greater &s;ucce&s;s or
encouragement in my endeavours to reform the pre|&s;ent Ta&s;te in literature.
I expected to have the priviledge of eating beef <HI>gratis</HI> every night at
<HI>Vauxhall,</HI> for advi&s;ing the garden-poets to put a little meaning into
their &s;ongs: but though I was there &s;everal nights this &s;ummer, I could
not &s;ay (with <HI>Ca&s;&s;io</HI>) of any of their productions, 
<Q REND="inline">"this is a more exqui&s;ite &s;ong than
t'other."</Q> I have not been able to write the operas out of the kingdom: and
though I have more than once &s;hewed my contempt for Harlequin, I am
a&s;&s;ured there are no le&s;s than three <PB N="840" REF="415"> Pantomimes to
be brought on this &s;ea&s;on. As I &s;et my|&s;elf up for &s;upreme judge in
theatrical matters, I was in hopes, that my Lord Chamberlain would at lea&s;t
ap|pointed me his Deputy-Licen&s;er; but he has not even con&s;ult me on any
one new play. I made no doubt, but the managers would pay their court to me:
but they have not once &s;ent for me to dinner; and &s;o far from having the
freedom of the hou&s;e, I declare I have not had &s;o much as a &s;ingle order
from any of the under-actors.</P>
<P>IN my office of CENSOR-GENERAL, though I cannot boa&s;t of
having over-turned the card-tables at routs and a&s;&s;emblies, or broke up the
club at <HI>Arthur</HI>'s, I can &s;afely boa&s;t, that I have routed the
many-headed mon&s;ter at the Di&s;putant Society at the <HI>Robin-hood,</HI>
and put to &s;ilence the great <HI>Clare-market</HI> Orator. In a word, I have
la|boured to prevent the growth of vice and immorality; and with as much effect
as the Ju&s;tices at the Quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions. For this rea&s;on I expected
to have been put into commi&s;&s;ion, and to have had the power of licen&s;ing
all places of public diver&s;ion ve&s;ted &s;olely in my hands. But as I find
my merits have been hitherto overlooked, I am determined to lay down my office;
and in my next num|ber I &s;hall take my final leave of the public, when I
&s;hall give them an account or my corre&s;pondents, together with a full and
particular account of MYSELF.</P>

but be now flatters him&s;elf, that they will look upon him as an old

with; and, as they will &s;ee him no more after this time, will now and then
perhaps mi&s;s their u&s;ual vi&s;iter.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this may be, the Authors of the CON|NOISSEUR now think
proper to clo&s;e the undertaking, in which they have been engaged for near
three years pa&s;t: and among their general thanks to the indulgent readers of
their papers, they mu&s;t include in a particular manner their acknowledgments
to tho&s;e, who have been plea&s;ed to appear in them as writers. They have,
there|fore, at the clo&s;e of their work brought Mr. TOWN and all his
a&s;&s;ociates on the &s;cene together, like the <HI>dra|matis per&s;onae</HI>
at the end of the la&s;t act.</P>
<P>OUR earlie&s;t and mo&s;t frequent corre&s;pondent is only known
to us by the initials G. K. and we are &s;orry, that he will not put it in our
power to mention his name; which (if we are not mi&s;taken in our gue&s;s)
would reflect as much credit on our work, as we are &s;ure will redound to it
from his contributions. To him we are proud to own our&s;elves indebted for
mo&s;t part of N^o. 14 and 17; for the letter, &s;igned <HI>Goliah
Engli&s;h,</HI> in N^o. 19; for a great part of N^o. 33 and 40; and for the
letters, &s;igned <HI>Reginald Fitzworm, Michael Krawbidge, Mo&s;es
Orthodox,</HI> and <HI>T. Vainall,</HI> in N^o. 102, 107, 113, and 129.</P>
<P>THE next, in priority of time, is a gentleman of
<HI>Cam|bridge,</HI> who &s;igned him&s;elf A. B. and we cannot but re|gret
that he withdrew his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, after having obliged us with the be&s;t
part of the letters in N^o. 46, 49, and 52; and of the e&s;&s;ays in N^o. 62
and 64.</P>
<P>THE letters in N^o. 82, 98, 112, and 130, came from various
hands, equally unknown to us. The Imi|tation of <HI>Horace,</HI> in N^o. 11,
was written (as we are in|formed) by a gentleman of <HI>Oxford:</HI> the Ode to
Friend|&s;hip, in N^o. 125, was &s;ent to us by a gentleman of
<HI>Cam|bridge</HI>; and from two other gentlemen of that Univer&s;ity we
received the letter, &s;igned <HI>W. Manly,</HI> in N^o. 65, and another,
&s;igned B. A. in N^o. 107.</P>
<P><PB N="843" REF="418">THESE unexpected marks of favour,
conferred on us by &s;trangers, demand our highe&s;t gratitude: but we are no
le&s;s happy in being able to boa&s;t of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome other
gentlemen, whom we are proud to call friends, though we are not at liberty to
introduce them to the acquaintance of our readers. From a friend, en|gaged in
the Law, we had the fir&s;t &s;ketches and mo&s;t &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages in
N^o. 75, 78, 87, and 104; though it may be regretted by the public as well as
our&s;elves, that his lei&s;ure would not permit him to put the fini&s;hing
hand to them. From a friend, a gentleman of the <HI>Temple,</HI> we received
N^o. 111, 115, and 119. To a friend, a member of <HI>Trinity College,
Cambridge,</HI> we are indebted for the Song in N^o. 72, and the Ver&s;es in
N^o. 67, 90, 125, and 135. The li&s;t of contributions from &s;uch capable
friends would doubtle&s;s have been much larger, had they been &s;ooner let
into the &s;ecret: but as Mr. TOWN, like a great prince, cho&s;e to appear
<HI>incog.</HI> in order to avoid the impertinence of others, he did not even
make him&s;elf known to tho&s;e about his per&s;on, till at la&s;t they
them&s;elves found him out through his di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;till remaining two corre&s;pondents, who mu&s;t
&s;tand by them&s;elves; as they have wrote to us, not in an a&s;&s;umed
character, but <HI>in propri&acirc; per&s;on&acirc;.</HI> The fir&s;t is no
le&s;s a per&s;onage than the great Orator HENLY, who obliged us with that
truly original letter, printed in N^o. 37. The other, who favoured us with a
letter no le&s;s original in N^o. 70, we have rea&s;on to be|lieve, is a
Methodi&s;t Teacher and a mechanic; but we do not know either his name or his
trade.</P>
<P>WE now come to the mo&s;t important di&s;covery of Our&s;elves,
and to an&s;wer the often-repeated que&s;tion of; <HI>Who is Mr.</HI> TOWN? it
being the cu&s;tom for periodical writers, at the &s;ame time that they &s;end
the hawkers abroad with their la&s;t dying &s;peech like the malefactors, like
them al&s;o to couple it with a confe&s;&s;ion. The general method of
unravelling this my&s;tery is by de|claring, to whom the different &s;ignatures
affixed to dif|ferent papers are appropriated. For ever &s;ince the days of the
inimitable SPECTATOR, it has been u&s;ual for a <PB N="844" REF="419"> bold
Capital to &s;tand, like a &s;entry, at the end of our e&s;&s;ays, to guard the
author in &s;ecre&s;y: and it is com|monly &s;uppo&s;ed, that the writer, who
does not chu&s;e to put his name to his work, has in this manner, like the
painters and &s;tatuaries of old, at lea&s;t &s;et his mark. But the Authors of
the CONNOISSEUR now confe&s;s, that the &s;everal letters, at fir&s;t pitched
upon to bring up the rear of their e&s;&s;ays, have been annexed to different
papers at random, and &s;ometimes omitted, on purpo&s;e to put the &s;agacious
reader on a wrong &s;cent. It is particularly the intere&s;t of a writer, who
prints him&s;elf out week by week, to remain unknown during the cour&s;e of
this piece-meal publication. The be&s;t method, therefore, to prevent a
di&s;covery is to make the road to it as intricate as po&s;&s;ible; and,
in&s;tead of &s;eeming to aim at keeping the reader entirely in the dark, to
hang out a kind of wan|dering light, which only &s;erves to lead him a&s;tray.
The de&s;ire of giving each writer his due, according to the &s;ignatures, has
in the cour&s;e of this undertaking often confu&s;ed the curious in their
inquiries. Soon after the publication of our fir&s;t papers, &s;ome ingenious
gentlemen found out, that T, O, W, N, being the letters that form|ed the name
of TOWN, there were four authors, each of whom &s;heltered him&s;elf under a
particular letter; but no paper ever appearing with an N affixed to it, they
were obliged to give up this notion. But, if they had been more able
decypherers, they would have made out, that though T, O, W, will not compo&s;e
the name of TOWN, yet by a different arrangement of the letters it will form
the word TWO; which is the grand my&s;tery of our &s;ignatures, and couches
under it the true and real number of the Authors of the CONNOISSEUR.</P>
<P>HAVING thus declared Mr. TOWN to con&s;i&s;t of two &s;eparate
individuals, it will perhaps be expected that, like two trade&s;men, who have
agreed to di&s;&s;olve their part|ner&s;hip, we &s;hould exactly ballance our
accounts, and a&s;&s;ign to each his due parcel of the &s;tock. But our
ac|counts are of &s;o intricate a nature, that it would be im|po&s;&s;ible for
us to adju&s;t them in that manner. We have not only joined in the work taken
altogether, but almo&s;t every &s;ingle paper is the joint product of both:
and, as we have laboured equally in erecting the fabric, we can|not 
<PB N="845" REF="420"> pretend, that any one particular part is the &s;ole
work|man&s;hip of either. An hint has perhaps been &s;tarted by one of us,
improved by the other, and &s;till further heigh|tened by an happy coalition of
&s;entiment in both; as fire is &s;truck out by a mutual colli&s;ion of flint
and &s;teel. Sometimes, like <HI>Strada</HI>'s lovers conver&s;ing with the
&s;ym|pathetic needles, we have written papers together at fifty miles
di&s;tance from each other: the fir&s;t rough draught or loo&s;e minutes of an
e&s;&s;ay have often travelled in the &s;tage-coach from town to country, and
from country to town; and we have frequently waited for the po&s;tman (whom we
expected to bring us the precious remainder of a CONNOISSEUR) with the &s;ame
anxiety, as we &s;hould wait for the half of a bank note, without which the
other half would be of no value. The&s;e our joint labours, it may ea&s;ily be
imagined, would have &s;oon broke off ab|ruptly, if either had been too fondly
attached to his own little conceits; or if we had conver&s;ed together with the
jealou&s;y of a rival, or the complai&s;ance of a formal ac|quaintance, who
&s;miles at every word that is &s;aid by his companion. Nor could this work
have been &s;o long car|ried on, with &s;o much chearfulne&s;s and good-humour
on both &s;ides, if the Two had not been as clo&s;ely united, as the two
Students, whom the SPECTATOR mentions as recorded by a <HI>Terrae Filius</HI>
at <HI>Oxford,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"to have had but one mind, one pur&s;e, one
chamber, and one hat."</Q></P>
<P>IT has been often remarked, that the reader is very de&s;irous
of picking up &s;ome little particulars concerning the author of the book,
which he is peru&s;ing. To gratify this pa&s;&s;ion, many literary anecdotes
have been publi&s;h|ed, and an account of their life, character, and behaviour,
has been prefixed to the works of our mo&s;t celebrated writers.
E&s;&s;ayi&s;ts are commonly expected to be their own Biographers: and perhaps
our readers may require &s;ome further intelligence concerning the Authors of
the CONNOISSEUR. But, as they have all along ap|peared as a &s;ort of
<HI>Sofias</HI> in literature, they cannot now de&s;cribe them&s;elves any
otherwi&s;e, than as one and the &s;ame per&s;on; and can only &s;atisfy the
curio&s;ity of the pub|lic, by giving a &s;hort account of that re&s;pectable
per&s;onage Mr. TOWN, con&s;idering him as of the plural, or rather (according
to the <HI>Grecians</HI>) of the dual number.</P>
<P><PB N="846" REF="421">Mr. TOWN is a fair, black, middle-&s;ized,
very &s;hort man. He wears his own hair, and a perriwig. He is about thirty
years of age, and not more than four and twenty. He is a Student of the Law,
and a Batchelor of Phy&s;ic. He was bred at the Univer&s;ity of
<HI>Oxford;</HI> where having taken no le&s;s than three degrees, he looks down
on many learned Profe&s;&s;ors, his inferiors: yet having been there but little
longer than to take the fir&s;t degree of Batchelor of Arts, it has more than
once happened, that the CEN|SOR-GENERAL of all <HI>England</HI> has been
reprimanded by the Cen&s;or of his College, for neglecting to furni&s;h the
u&s;ual E&s;&s;ay, or (in the collegiate phra&s;e) the Theme of the week.</P>
<P>This joint de&s;cription of our&s;elves will, we hope,
&s;a|tisfy the reader without any further information. For our own parts, we
cannot but be plea&s;ed with having rai&s;ed this monument of our mutual
friend&s;hip and e&s;teem: and if the&s;e e&s;&s;ays &s;hall continue to be
read, when they will no longer make their appearance as the fugitive pieces of
the week, we &s;hall be happy in con|&s;idering, that we are mentioned at the
&s;ame time. We have all the while gone on, as it were, hand in hand together:
and white we are both employed in furni&s;hing matter for the paper now before
us, we cannot help &s;miling at our thus making our <HI>exit</HI> together,
like the two Kings of <HI>Brentford</HI> &s;melling at one no&s;egay.</P>
