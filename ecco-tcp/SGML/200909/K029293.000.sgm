<HEAD>PROLOGUE, WRITTEN BY MR. TAYLOR.</HEAD>
<SP>
<STAGE>SPOKEN BY MR. BETTERTON.</STAGE>
<L>A Well-known Mu&s;e, who labours once a-year,</L>
<L>And oft has found a &s;afe A&s;ylum here,</L>
<L>Though Critic &s;torms a Mother's fears excite,</L>
<L>With her new Offspring ventures forth to-night.</L>
<L>Con&s;cious the features mu&s;t betray the Sire,</L>
<L>She &s;eeks for no di&s;gui&s;e of vain attire;</L>
<L>What hone&s;t Nature gave &s;he brings to view,</L>
<L>And for a kind adoption re&s;ts on you.</L>
<L>Yet haply now with rea&s;on &s;he appears</L>
<L>Oppre&s;s'd with more than e'en maternal fears.</L>
<L>For &s;ince &s;he la&s;t enjoy'd your fo&s;t'ring &s;mile,</L>
<L>A German Rival's charms have caught our I&s;le.</L>
<L>And though &s;he knows that Rival's favor'd race,</L>
<L>With daring force combine a &s;oft'ning grace,</L>
<L>She knows, be&s;ides, that one of native breed</L>
<L>May always hope with Britons to &s;ucceed:</L>
<L>And hence, though fa&s;hion call her bigot-&s;ool,</L>
<L>She takes no le&s;&s;ons from a foreign &s;chool&mdash;</L>
<L>But with a patriot pride &s;he lets you know,</L>
<L>"'Tis Engli&s;h! Engli&s;h, Sirs! from top to toe!"</L>
<L>While on your liberal candour we rely,</L>
<L>And Fa&s;hion's rage with patriot zeal defy,</L>
<L>Think not our Author &s;ees with jealous pain</L>
<L>Exotic merit Briti&s;h laurels gain&mdash;</L>
<L>No&mdash;when to ALBION'S ho&s;pitable &s;hore</L>
<L>MISFORTUNE flies protection to implore;</L>
<L>Or GENIUS darting from a di&s;tant &s;phere,</L>
<L>That mental Comet &s;preads its radiance here;</L>
<L>May Britons glow with philanthropic fire,</L>
<L>Eager alike to cheri&s;h and admire!</L>

<P>Good morning, good old Geoffry.&mdash; I have once more eluded the vigilance of my per|&s;ecutor&mdash;once more &s;tolen forth from the ca&s;tle, pur|po&s;ely to vi&s;it this &s;pot; and if my father hears of it, I hope he won't be angry with me:&mdash;though he denies me his protection, &s;urely he will not pre|clude me from contemplating &s;cenes that remind me of him and my dear Mother!&mdash;why, what's the matter? you &s;eem agitated.</P>

<P>Well I may, Mi&s;s Juliana&mdash;your father

<P>Expect my father!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; after an ab&s;ence of thirteen years, I expect Sir Hervey once more at Sutherland-hou&s;e: &mdash;look, here's his letter.</P>

<P>Oh, I'm &s;o happy!&mdash;I &s;hall at la&s;t behold, perhaps embrace him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I fear otherwi&s;e; Sir Hervey is of a mo&s;t unforgiving di&s;po&s;ition, and the wrongs your mother put upon him were of a nature not ea&s;ily to be forgotten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Wrongs!&mdash;what wrongs, Geoffry? is the dark tale for ever to be concealed from me?&mdash; I am de&s;erted by my father, and not to know the cau&s;e!&mdash;Come, good old man! remember, you pro|mi&s;ed you would one day tell me, and &s;ince we are alone, and may not have another opportunity, come now&mdash;unveil the my&s;tery&mdash;how, how did my mother wrong him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, to keep my word&mdash;Sir Hervey ever was, and I fear ever will be, a dupe to fa&s;hion and its follies:&mdash;he gamed, he intrigued&mdash;and though in his heart devoted to Lady Sutherland, he for&s;ook her and his home for &s;cenes of riot and di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unfortunate infatuation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Sutherland a long while bore this with fortitude and re&s;ignation; but young, beautiful, and accompli&s;hed, &s;urrounded by admirers and neglected by her hu&s;band, &s;he at la&s;t li&s;tened to the addre&s;&s;es of an artful and de&s;igning villain, who convinced her of Sir Hervey's infidelity, and, by means of forged letters and other artifices, per&s;uaded her to elope with him.</P>

<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis too true, madam;&mdash;but her guilt was of &s;hort duration:&mdash;in a few days &s;he came back to that hou&s;e, all penitence and &s;hame.&mdash;I &s;hall never forget the day.&mdash;I told Sir Hervey of her return, and he in a fit of rage and madne&s;s bid me &s;hut the door again&s;t her; this &s;he overheard: 'twas too much for a tender nature like hers:&mdash;&s;he fled, and &s;oon after died&mdash;died of a broken heart!</P>

<P>You were then but eight years old, and till that hour the idol of Sir Hervey:&mdash;but your likene&s;s to your mother &s;oon making him wi&s;h to avoid you, you were removed to the ca&s;tle; where he inve&s;ted Mrs. Dazzle with the unlimited power of a guardian over you, and which I fear &s;he has exerted like a tyrant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.&mdash;Sir Hervey could not mean that I &s;hould be her pri&s;oner!&mdash;But go on: he went abroad&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did &mdash; to Naples, where he has ever &s;ince re&s;ided: and now, what think you, madam? do you blame the living or the dead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no right to condemn either&mdash;but in my mind the hu&s;band who neglects an amiable wife is re&s;pon&s;ible for all the evils that en&s;ue.&mdash; Died of a broken heart!&mdash;oh, that he had but par|doned her!&mdash;then he had had a wife, and I a mo|ther to con&s;ole me!&mdash;but now&mdash;Do I indeed re&s;emble her?</P>

<L>A &s;turdy farmer bought the walls:&mdash;why then,</L>
<L>What was a barn will be a barn again.</L>
<L>Corn on the &s;tage, not mummers will be &s;een;</L>
<L>And oats be thre&s;h'd where actors &s;hould have been;</L>
<L>Wheat &s;trew the boards where er&s;t did heroes tread,</L>
<L>To make&mdash;what heroes never made there&mdash;bread.</L>

<L>Stage-&s;truck, but hen-peck'd, hone&s;t Ju&s;tice Dunder</L>
<L>Has all my clouds,&mdash;his lady has my thunder.</L>
<L>Dick Drench, the &s;nug apothecary, means</L>
<L>To give a private play, &s;o buys my &s;cenes:</L>
<L>Drench, "&s;melling of the &s;hop," and <HI>idem &s;emper,</HI></L>
<L>Could not re&s;i&s;t &s;cenes painted in di&s;temper.</L>

<L>The Member for the town bought all my coats;</L>
<L>There he was wi&s;e&mdash;for I command two votes;</L>
<L>And playhou&s;e coats (again he &s;hew'd di&s;cerning)</L>
<L>Will &s;uit a Member, for they're us'd to turning.</L>

<L>My wigs the women quarrell'd for, &s;weet &s;ouls!</L>
<L>My daggers &s;tuck in &s;elling; but my bowls</L>
<L>Mine ho&s;t of the Red Lion clapp'd his eyes on,</L>
<L>And bought 'em, as I did, to &s;erve up poi&s;on.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus all my country &s;tock, as Shak&s;peare &s;ays,</L>
<L>"My cloud-capt towers, my gorgeous palaces,</L>
<L>"Yea, my great globe," (the barn,) &s;o much involv'd,</L>

<L>My "&s;olemn temple," which I now for&s;ake;</L>

<L>That I have left a cur&s;ed "wreck behind."</L>

<L>Here then I come, by rural &s;chemes half undone,</L>
<L>But country &s;tumps appear new brooms in London.</L>
<L>Egad I'll &s;weep all clean&mdash;look to't&mdash;ne'er doubt me&mdash;</L>
<L>A London Manager, I'll lay about me;</L>

<L>"A five act play la&s;t night was repre&s;ented,</L>
<L>"By an amazing <HI>Dramati&s;t</HI> invented!</L>
<L>"Author's and Actors' merits were immen&s;e,</L>
