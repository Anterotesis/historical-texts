<HEAD>TO <HI>Her Grace the Dutche&s;s</HI> OF RICHMOND and LENOX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO fly to the BEAU|TIFUL, the GOOD, and the GREAT, as to GUARDIAN-ANGELS, for Protection, has been the Practice of <HI>humble</HI> Adven|turers for Fame in all Ages;
<PB N="ii" REF="4">but which of <HI>the&s;e</HI> Virtues out &s;hines the other in your GRACE, requires a nicer Judgment than mine to de|termine. I can only di|&s;tingui&s;h, that they give a kind of Glory and Lu&s;tre to each other: I can only &s;ay, they are &s;o eminently con&s;picuous together, as to make your GRACE'S Per&s;on <HI>&s;eem</HI> to the wondering Eye like a Paradi&s;e, and your Soul a Cherubim within to guard it. I can only
<PB N="iii" REF="5">di&s;cover to the World a Part of your GRACE'S Ex|cellencies, and that too ac|cording to the Mea&s;ure of my own Weakne&s;s. Like tho&s;e who have &s;urvey'd &s;ome Cele&s;tial Luminary or Con&s;tellation, I can on|ly tell of a new and &s;hining World above me, but not all the Riches and Glories of the Place.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome of your GRACE'S Virtues, of
<PB N="iv" REF="6">a publick Nature, &s;uch as Candour, Benevolence, and Genero&s;ity, which di&s;play them&s;elves in &s;uch an ami|able Variety of Lights, that not to perceive them, or to deny them to be YOUR'S, would be as ungrateful as not to perceive, or to deny the SUN'S Exi&s;tence, at the &s;ame Time that we feel its beneficial and exten&s;ive In|fluence. The noble Man|ner in which your GRACE &s;eems to enjoy Riches,
<PB N="v" REF="7">would almo&s;t tempt one to think, that FORTUNE, if I may &s;o &s;peak, had con|&s;ulted REASON when &s;he be&s;tow'd them on YOU, &s;ince the World has more Cau&s;e to wi&s;h you the Ad|dition, than envy you the Abundance.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; For Merit hence is heard</L>
<L>Amid&s;t its Blu&s;hes; dawning Arts ari&s;e;</L>
<L>The gloomy Clouds, which Ignorance or Fear</L>
<L>Spread o'er the Paths of Virtue, are di&s;pell'd;</L>
<L><PB N="vi" REF="8">Servility retires, and ev'ry Heart</L>
<L>With <HI>publick</HI> Cares is warm'd.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>YOUR GRACE'S Encou|ragement of Learning is the more extraordinary at a Time when many think they but too well recom|pence an Author, if they honour him with a barren Prai&s;e.&mdash;I have the publick Voice to atte&s;t what I have now advanced concerning your GRACE, and there|fore, I hope, I &s;hall not be &s;u&s;pected of uttering tho&s;e
<PB N="vii" REF="9">obliging Fal&s;hoods, which many of our Moderns can do without blu&s;hing.</P>
<P>AND here, MADAM, I am proud that I cannot flatter, if I &s;ay YOUR pri|vate Virtues have de&s;erv'd to be &s;et as an Example to a le&s;s-degenerate, le&s;s-taint|ed Age. They approach &s;o near to Singularity in ours, that I can hardly make a Panegyrick to your GRACE, without a Satyr
<PB N="viii" REF="10">on many others: And therefore this is a Theme that I mu&s;t ca&s;t in Shades, and leave your GRACE to the Te&s;timony and Sati&s;|faction of your own Mind, which, tho' a &s;ilent Enco|mium, is &s;till the be&s;t. This epi&s;tolary Addre&s;s keeps its Di&s;tance, and goes no farther than my Heart. There it is I feel all the Tran&s;port and Joy imaginable, when I &s;ee Virtue encourag'd, and
<PB N="ix" REF="11">Learning patronis'd and re|warded by your GRACE'S noble Family. &mdash; That it may long enjoy the full Vintage of its flowing Ho|nours, is the &s;incere and earne&s;t Wi&s;h of,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>Written by a</HI> FRIEND.</BYLINE>
<P>THE Author of the&s;e Vo|lumes is too well convinc'd of his own Weakne&s;s, to be pleas'd with any thing he has writ|ten; and he has &s;o little of the Self-Opinion of a Writer in him, that he has impos'd the Task upon another to &s;ay &s;omething concern|ing
<PB N="ii" REF="13">his Work. After a Review of &s;o con&s;iderable a Body of Men as the Clergy, he has mode&s;tly at|tempted to &s;hew, why the Number of good Orators among them is &s;o incon&s;iderable; why &s;o few, &s;o very few, of tho&s;e who are bred to the Church, become Ma&s;ters of the Force and Charms of Eloquence.</P>
<P>THO' he may not have pointed out all the &s;everal Rea&s;ons that might be a&s;&s;ign'd for it, yet in Obe|dience to a young Gentleman's Com|mands, who de&s;ign'd to go into HOLY ORDERS, he has very freely let him into his Sentiments about every Particular relating to
<PB N="iii" REF="14">this Subject. And he enter'd the more boldly upon the Enquiry, from this Con&s;ideration, that no Embelli&s;hment of Stile could be expected from him in a Letter. Epi&s;tolary Writing mu&s;t re&s;emble a natural Conver&s;ation, tho' it may be a little better than what the Generality of People are &s;uppos'd to &s;peak Extempore, as a PICTURE may be like, tho' hand&s;omer than the Original.</P>
<P>IN a Di&s;qui&s;ition of &s;o much Im|portance, he thought it no ill Me|thod to exhibit the mo&s;t material Accompli&s;hments requir'd in a DI|VINE, and the Blemi&s;hes he ought
<PB N="iv" REF="15">carefully to beware of, and to &s;et in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous Point of View obvious Examples for Illu&s;tration|&s;ake. He has endeavour'd to pro|duce &s;uch In&s;tances of Offenders, both in Eloquence and Morals, as may convince any impartial Per&s;on, that, by proper Means, Coxcomb after Coxcomb may be gently led off the &s;acred Stage, and per&s;uaded to part with every glaring Particu|larity which drew them into the Mini&s;try or the Pulpit to be laugh'd at. Some Men have a &s;trange In|clination to branch out into Ex|tremes, and will be dilating them|&s;elves into the Ridiculous, unle&s;s &s;ome benevolent Hand takes the
<PB N="v" REF="16">Trouble to prune their Luxurian|ces, to pare away the Redundancies of Fancy, till they are left in the becoming Simplicity of Action and Delivery.</P>
<P>HAD &s;ome of our modern Preach|ers but the lea&s;t Spark of Emula|tion in them, they would blu&s;h to find the little Progre&s;s they have made in the Study of Eloquence, at an Age in which many others have &s;ucceeded &s;o well, as to be able to give Sweetne&s;s to the Eye, Charm to the Tongue, and Grace to Mo|tion, and to point their Arguments with all the Life and Spirit, with all the Edge and Flame, that Wit,
<PB N="vi" REF="17">or Judgment, or Example, could give them.</P>
<P>'TIS &s;trange, indeed, to &s;ee how differently the VANITY of Preach|ers runs. 'Tis the Boa&s;t of many a one, of but a raw Fancy, and un|taught unpractis'd Ear, which has not had an Opportunity to form it&s;elf, and become truly mu&s;ical, that by his Genius alone, and a na|tural Rapidity of Stile and Thought, and an elaborate Freedom and Faci|lity of Action, he is able to carry all the Affections of his Hearers be|fore him: Others again, with a wonderous affected Air, li&s;p in the Pulpit as in their Cradles; and their
<PB N="vii" REF="18">pretty &s;tammering Tongues, which nothing be&s;ides their Ignorance can excu&s;e, &s;peak continually in wretch|ed Pun and Quibble: And even a later Race, &s;carce free of this In|firmity, and aiming at a fal&s;e Su|blime, with crowded Simile and mix'd Metaphor, become rather ri|diculous in endeavouring to di&s;co|ver the Pains they have taken to be oratorical.</P>
<P>THE Way of Form and Method in many of the Sermons we hear preach'd, has &s;o little Force towards the winning our Attention, that 'tis apter to tire us, than the Metre of the old Ballad of <HI>The Children in
<PB N="viii" REF="19">the Wood.</HI> We no &s;ooner hear the Text given out, the Subject divided and &s;ubdivided, (with <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and &s;o forth, as Order requires than in&s;tantly we begin a Strife with Nature, which otherwi&s;e might &s;urprize us in the &s;oft Fetters of Sleep; to the great Di&s;grace of the Preacher, and Scandal of the Au|dience.</P>
<P>THE Manner of dividing a Di&s;|cour&s;e into plain FIRSTS and SE|CONDS only, is of late grown &s;o much out of Fa&s;hion, I think, that 'tis the unpoli&s;h'd Country-Orator alone almo&s;t, who pre&s;ents his Au|dience with a DIVISIBLE DIS|COURSE
<PB N="ix" REF="20">The well-bred Court-Divine exhorts in POLITE ESSAY, and is a&s;ham'd to bring his &s;imple TWOS and THREES concerning HELL-TORMENTS before a fa|&s;hionable A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>THE Truth of all this may ea&s;ily be apprehended by tho&s;e who know any thing of the pre&s;ent State of Pulpit-Eloquence, or are in the lea&s;t fitted to judge of the Manner of the common Preachers of the Times.</P>
<P>WHOEVER has been an Ob&s;er|ver of Action and Grace in Preach|ing, mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity have di&s;co|ver'd
<PB N="x" REF="21">the great Difference in this Re&s;pect, between &s;uch Per&s;ons as have had the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Nature and a &s;imple rude Education only, and &s;uch as have had the Advantage of forming them&s;elves under the be&s;t Ma&s;ters at OXFORD or CAM|BRIDGE. There are &s;ome Men, indeed, &s;o happily form'd by Na|ture her&s;elf, that with the greate&s;t Simplicity or Rudene&s;s of Educa|tion, they have &s;till &s;omething of a natural Grace and Comeline&s;s in their Action and Delivery: And there are others of a better Educa|tion, who by a wrong Aim, and in|judicious Affectation of Grace, are of all People the farthe&s;t remov'd
<PB N="xi" REF="22">from it. 'Tis undeniable, however, that the Perfection of Grace in Preaching can be found only among the People of a liberal Education. And even among the graceful of this kind, tho&s;e &s;till are found the gracefulle&s;t, who early in their Youth have learn'd their Exerci&s;es under the be&s;t and able&s;t Ma&s;ters, &s;uch as a<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">An eminent Tutor at QUEEN's College, OXON.</NOTE> FOTHERGILL or a<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">A Tutor at St JOHN's College, CAMBRIDGE.</NOTE> RUTHERFORTH.</P>
<P>'TIS remark'd, that by the Help of Imitation, and the Force of Example merely, &s;uch a Comeli|ne&s;s
<PB N="x" REF="23">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="xi" REF="24">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="xii" REF="25">of Language and Delivery is acquir'd, with &s;uch apt Motions and Freedom of Action, as on all ordinary Occa&s;ions may enable a Man to de|mean him&s;elf prettily enough in the Pulpit: But when, upon farther Occa&s;ion, Trial is made in an extra|ordinary Way; when Sermons of the genteeler kind are to be preach|ed, 'twill ea&s;ily appear who of the Preachers have been form'd by the mo&s;t excellent Rudiments and Ma|&s;ters; and who, on the other Side, have wanted the Opportunity and Means of forming them&s;elves after the better Models. Methinks, I can di&s;tingui&s;h the Man of liberal Education, and pregnant Genius,
<PB N="xiii" REF="26">by the fine Drapery, and beautiful Colouring of his Stile, which al|ways has a certain Fullne&s;s without Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s, is gentle, yet lively and &s;trong, and &s;uch that its Excellency lies in its equally partaking a mo|derate Share of both kinds: I ob|&s;erve 'tis attended with a Colouring which appears hand&s;ome, not from the Daubing of Paint, but the Flu&s;h of Health.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible that other Topicks, than what my Friend's Letters are upon, would have been more to the Liking of &s;ome People. For Hu|man Nature is &s;o form'd, that he
<PB N="xiv" REF="27">who flatters Men for his own In|tere&s;t, plea&s;es more, than he who has no View but Publick Benefit. And &s;ome Men there are of &s;o con|fus'd a Thought, and &s;o irregularly form'd within them&s;elves, that 'tis no more than natural for them to be di&s;pleas'd, and to find Fault with the be&s;t-natur'd and mo&s;t benevo|lent Performances; but about &s;uch our Author need not be under the lea&s;t Concern, as to what their Sen|timents of him may be, &s;o long as he has the Countenance and En|couragement of the mo&s;t worthy of his Profe&s;&s;ion.&mdash;A Man that &s;hould pur&s;ue Learning even with the di&s;|intere&s;ted

<BIBL><HI>Vide Mr</HI> GLOVER'<HI>'s</HI> LEONIDAS, <HI>L.</HI> 5.</BIBL></NOTE> TERIBAZUS, would need more than all the Abi|lities
<PB N="xvi" REF="29">of that noble PERSIAN to con|vince the worthle&s;s Part of the
<PB N="xvii" REF="30">World of his Di&s;cretion, unle&s;s he had made &s;ome Improvement in the Plea&s;ures of the Palate, in Wealth and Luxury.</P>
<P>IT will evidently appear, that from the Beginning of this epi&s;to|latory Work he has vary'd his Stile according to the Nature of the Sub|ject
<PB N="xviii" REF="31">he is upon, and has taken the Liberty now and then to depart a little from the Cour&s;e of it, that he might introduce a greater Variety of Sentiments, indulge his Corre|&s;pondent with agreeable Digre&s;&s;ions, to entertain and relieve his Juvenile Mind, who&s;e Improvement, Plea|&s;ure, and In&s;truction, he had &s;olely in View.</P>
<P>WHATEVER &s;ome Men may think, the Letters are real, and not preci&s;e and formal Treati&s;es, de|&s;ign'd for the Pre&s;s; tho' 'tis be|come indeed &s;o common a Prac|tice among Authors, to feign a Cor|re&s;pondency, and give the Title of
<PB N="xix" REF="32">Private Letters, to Pieces addre&s;s'd to the Publick, that I &s;hould not at all wonder, if &s;ome People look'd upon the&s;e Epi&s;tles merely as fictitious; like tho&s;e of SENECA to his Friend LUCILIUS, or tho&s;e of ancient Sophi&s;ts, Grammarians, or Rhetoricians.</P>
<P>IT will be expected, perhaps, that I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething with re|gard to the POEM of THE ROYAL PENITENT, and THE EXHORTA|TION: The De&s;ign of the&s;e is to &s;hew the Advantage that SACRED has over PROPHANE POETRY. The Trea&s;ures of it are almo&s;t in|finite; and it fares with tho&s;e that
<PB N="xx" REF="33">&s;tudy it, as with a Traveller, when he a&s;cends a ri&s;ing Ground: every new Step enlarges his Horizon, and pre&s;ents new Countries, new Plea|&s;ures to his Eye. Our Northern I&s;land will in Time, I hope, burn with as many Altars to the SACRED MUSE, as did formerly in CYPRUS, DELPHOS, or any of tho&s;e warmer GRECIAN Climates, to VENUS and APOLLO.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I AM glad to hear of your Re&s;olu|tion to enter into the Service of GOD; you could not po&s;&s;ibly chu&s;e a better Ma&s;ter, provided you are but &s;ufficiently qualified to &s;erve &s;uch a Ma&s;ter well, and to acquit your&s;elf with Honour in the Exerci&s;e of the mini&s;terial Office. All the Duties and Qualifications which are requi&s;ite to the Pa&s;toral Charge, &s;eem to me to be &s;ummon'd up in the&s;e few Words of the Apo&s;tle St PAUL to
<PB N="2" REF="53">TIMOTHY;&mdash; <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 15.</NOTE> Study to &s;hew thy&s;elf ap|prov'd unto GOD, a WORKMAN that needeth not be a&s;hamed, rightly dividing the WORD of TRUTH.</Q>&mdash;For by being approved unto GOD, does not probably &s;ignify more than the <HI>plea&s;ing</HI> him, <HI>fearing, loving,</HI> and <HI>honouring</HI> him does; that is, by leading a religious and virtuous Life, according to the Rules of the Go&s;pel; thus<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xvi. 10.</NOTE> APELLES is &s;aid to be <HI>approv'd in</HI> CHRIST, and he is &s;aid to be the <GAP DESC="foreign">, the good, the upright, or approv'd Man; not he who commendeth him&s;elf, but whom the LORD<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. x. 18.</NOTE> commendeth. By being <HI>a Workman that needeth not be a&s;hamed,</HI> I take to be meant &s;uch an one who is &s;kilful in his Profe&s;&s;ion, one that is qualify'd with compe|tent Learning and Skill for the Di&s;charge of the Pa&s;toral Office; for a Mini&s;ter that wants the&s;e Qualifications <HI>had need to be a&s;hamed,</HI> becau&s;e 'tis a very great Shame for any Workman what&s;oever to work or practi&s;e in that Profe&s;&s;ion or Calling which he does not under&s;tand; for a Man cannot
<PB N="3" REF="54">have the Face &s;o much as to excu&s;e his Ignorance in that Matter which he profe&s;&s;es to know. By <HI>rightly dividing the Word of Truth,</HI> I under&s;tand the teaching &s;ound and orthodox Doctrine, the interpreting the Scripture truly and genuinely, without heretical, fal&s;e, erroneous, or whim&s;ical Glo&s;&s;es, which St PAUL does &s;o often caution again&s;t in many Places of his EPISTLES. For <HI>dividing</HI> the WORD &s;ignifies teaching or inter|preting it, being a Metaphor probably taken from the JEWISH Sections or Divi&s;ions of the LAW, one Divi&s;ion of which was read and commented upon every Sabbath-Day; &s;o that to <HI>divide</HI> the WORD, came to &s;ignify the interpreting, commenting, or preaching upon &s;uch a Divi&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>A GOOD Life then, according to the APOSTLE, is a Duty which is particularly incumbent upon us of the Clergy;&mdash;we mu&s;t &s;tudy to approve our|&s;elves unto GOD. Colours artfully &s;pread upon Canvas may entertain the Eye, but never affect the Heart; and he, who takes no Care to add to the natural Graces of his Eloquence any excellent
<PB N="4" REF="55">Qualities, may be allow'd &s;till to amu&s;e, as a PICTURE, but not to triumph over the Affec|tions of his Auditors. The Eloquence of a bad Man is &s;o involv'd in Smoke, that it does not ap|pear in half its Beauty; but that of a good Man &s;hews it&s;elf in &s;uch a Variety of corre&s;ponding a|greeable Lights, that it &s;hines, as it were, in an univer&s;al Blaze; his Sermons receive a Lu&s;tre from his Life, and his Delivery, tho' not &s;o graceful as that of a TILLOTSON, has however the Power of charming. Without this irradiating Power, the proude&s;t Divine ought to know, whatever he may think to the contrary, that his fine&s;t Sentiments, both in his Pulpit-Harangues, and in common Conver&s;ation, are uninform'd and dead. 'Tis the good, the upright, the approved Man only can deliver his Di&s;cour&s;e or his Opinion with Dignity, can rou&s;e a de&s;ponding, or check an outrageous Sinner; can cha&s;ti&s;e the Enormities of the Age, or applaud Virtue, Innocence, and Integrity. For how can the vicious Preacher be warm in exhort|ing to Devotion? How can he be vehement in re|claiming the Reprobate? How can be gracefully
<PB N="5" REF="56">recommend Piety and Virtue? How can he be &s;ucce&s;sful in &s;oothing the afflicted or de&s;ponding Chri&s;tian? 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible that a Hearer &s;hould ever be impre&s;s'd with Sorrow, with Hatred, with Dete&s;tation of Sin, with Dread of Puni&s;hment; 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to move him to Penitence, to Tears, and Contrition, unle&s;s the Preacher &s;hall appear po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of all the&s;e good Di&s;po&s;itions which he aims to awaken in others. A wicked Clergyman is a ridiculous Character; there is never a SUNDAY he goes to Church, but his Congregation are Wit|ne&s;&s;es of his Folly and Impudence; he never a&s;cends the ROSTRUM, but he undergoes a &s;evere Trial, and every Time he reads PRAYERS 'tis renew'd. For there is &s;carcely any one who hears him that has not a quicker, a more piercing Eye to the Defects of his Life, than the Beauties of his Delivery; &s;o that of what&s;oever Complection his Immoralities may be, they ca&s;t a Cloud over all his Excellencies. I mu&s;t own, indeed, he that hath made but one fal&s;e Step, or committed one &s;ingle Error in Life, is not immediately pronounc'd a Stranger to Virtue and Goodne&s;s; the good-natured
<PB N="6" REF="57">World always throws the Mantle of Cha|rity over it, becau&s;e 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for frail Man to be free from all Fault. I have known it an Advantage to many that they have committed Mi&s;takes in their fir&s;t &s;etting out in the World, becau&s;e they have thus improv'd their Caution and Prudence; and the Remembrance of former Mi&s;|carriages, has put them upon repairing little Slips with extraordinary Succe&s;s. To de&s;ire, indeed, to be free from all Fault, whil&s;t we are frail Men, is an extravagant Pitch of Arrogance; and as often to &s;tumble again&s;t the &s;ame Stone, and not to learn Caution, even when the Event cha&s;ti&s;es our Ra&s;hne&s;s, is even far beneath the Character of a Man.</P>
<P>As there is nothing &s;o di&s;ta&s;teful to an Au|dience as a bad Clergyman, &s;o there is nothing they &s;o much adore as a good one. They are &s;truck with the Beauty of INWARD CHARACTER, the Harmony and Numbers of the HEART, the ju&s;t Regulation of the AFFECTIONS, which form the Manners of an ORATOR.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="58">I SHALL therefore enter into a more particular Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Virtues, or moral Qualifications, which the ROMAN Orator &s;tiles the HAND|MAIDS of ELOQUENCE; and which we of this Profe&s;&s;ion are under an indi&s;pen&s;ible Obligation to practi&s;e, if we would approve our&s;elves unto GOD, or our Hearers, as eloquent DIVINES.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Virtue I &s;hall mention, as more par|ticularly nece&s;&s;ary for us to practi&s;e, is HUMI|LITY. There is not, indeed, any Degree of Meanne&s;s in the Pa&s;toral Office which &s;hould en|gage Clergymen to be more conde&s;cen&s;ive than others; for they have rather Rea&s;on to value them|&s;elves upon the Dignity of it. But &s;uch is the Na|ture of their Employ, that it being their Bu&s;ine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t and in&s;truct Per&s;ons of all Ranks and Qua|lities, as well the POOR as the RICH, 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible, without a con&s;iderable Degree of Humi|lity and Conde&s;cen&s;ion, that they &s;hould, in any tolerable Mea&s;ure, perform their Duty. We mu&s;t with as much Sincerity and Application in&s;truct the poore&s;t Child in our Pari&s;h in the Principles of
<PB N="8" REF="59">Religion, as if we had in Charge the Son of CAESAR. We mu&s;t with as great Readine&s;s vi&s;it in their Sickne&s;s the poor Alm&s;man and Beggar in their &s;qualid Cotrage, as we do tho&s;e great Per|&s;ons that lie expiring in Pomp and Splendor. 'Tis an intolerable Arrogance for us, upon a great Preferment, to put on a Mein of Grandeur and a &s;upercilious Carriage, and to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e poorer Labourers in the Go&s;pel, who have met with a le&s;s bountiful Reward. If any Clergyman were to &s;et a Value upon him&s;elf, it &s;hould be upon the con&s;cientious Di&s;charge of his Office, for the ELDER only <HI>that ruleth well is worthy of</HI> DOUBLE HONOUR; for the Church mu&s;t never value her&s;elf upon her Patrimony, becau&s;e her be&s;t and pure&s;t Ages were when &s;he inherited nothing but Per&s;ecution; and we find in Scripture an Abun|dance of Commendations and Ble&s;&s;ings upon good and faithful Pa&s;tors, but it is for <HI>feeding</HI> the SHEEP, and not for the WEIGHT of their FLEECE. And it is as great a Fault in a Clergy|man to be proud of great Parts and Learning, not only becau&s;e the&s;e are the Gi&s;ts of GOD as well
<PB N="9" REF="60">as other Things, but becau&s;e the&s;e Qualifications, when accompanied with Pride, do very little good, nay, commonly a great deal of Mi&s;chief in GOD's Church; for the learnede&s;t Men, tho' good, are not always the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful Pa&s;tors; tho' PAUL plants, and APOLLOS waters, yet it is GOD that gives the Increa&s;e; a painful and indu&s;trious, tho' le&s;s learned Mini&s;ter, may gain more Souls to CHRIST than the mo&s;t learned GAMALIELS; for oftentimes poor ignorant Wretches, which &s;tand unaffected by all the rational Strength of &s;ome great Doctors of the Law, are rous'd up to Repentance, and a Sen&s;e of Religion, by the weak Performances of &s;ome of the meane&s;t of the Sons of the Prophets.</P>
<P>THERE is a pretty remarkable Story of a COUNTRY CLERGYMAN, which, as perhaps you have not heard, I &s;hall here in&s;ert, and for a Matter of Fact. This Gentleman had a Son who, being deficient in point of Learning, was refu&s;ed DEACON'S ORDERS by a certain worthy PRE|LATE a few Years ago; it was &s;uch a Grief to
<PB N="10" REF="61">him, that he went per&s;onally to his Lord&s;hip, and begg'd hard that his Son might not return with &s;uch a Slur to the Univer&s;ity, and be di&s;couraged from making better U&s;e of his Time. <Q>MY LORD, &s;aid the Clergyman, be pleas'd but to admit my Son to DEACON'S ORDERS, and I will engage that he &s;hall appear before your Lord&s;hip the next Time with a better Stock of Learning, and approve him&s;elf not unworthy of your future Favour. When I was about his Age, I got into ORDERS, tho' but indifferently furni&s;h'd with Learning; for I had been very remi&s;s in my Studies. A few Years after, be|ing promoted to a Living, I found my Pa|ri&s;hioners mo&s;tly DISSENTERS, which, for a while, made me a little di&s;&s;atisfy'd. Now your Lord&s;hip may, perhaps, wonder how I did to manage them, being not over-burthen'd, at my fir&s;t &s;etting out, with Divinity. Why, my LORD, I took this Method, which effectually an&s;wer'd my De&s;ire. Whenever I had any Oc|ca&s;ion of &s;peaking with them, either at my own Hou&s;e, or any other Place, my Carriage
<PB N="11" REF="62">towards them was never dive&s;ted of good Man|ners, and I never made my Company di&s;ta&s;teful to them on the Score of Opinion. I frequent|ly had them to &s;pend an Evening with me, and our Di&s;cour&s;e was chiefly confin'd to &s;uch Things as fall in Countrymens' Way. By the&s;e Means, and doing them all the good Turns in my Power, I had much of their Company; and can now, with Comfort, &s;ay, that of all the DISSENTERS in my Pari&s;h that went to the MEETING, I have not one now that goes to it; they all come as duly to Church as the re&s;t of my People.&mdash;This, my LORD, was my Ca&s;e, and I leave it to your Lord&s;hip's Candour and Con&s;ideration.</Q> The good Bi&s;hop, I have been told, was &s;o plea&s;ed with this Country Clergyman's hone&s;t Simplicity and plain Dealing, that he obliged him, and ordain'd his Son.</P>
<P>THIS STORY, if duly con&s;ider'd, is enough to quell the Pride of tho&s;e Clergymen who un|mea&s;urably value them&s;elves upon their Learning and great Preferment, and look upon others only
<PB N="12" REF="63">as the Caterpillars in the Vineyard. Such Endow|ments, &s;ingle of them&s;elves, are no Qualifications for a Chri&s;tian Mini&s;try, and they may as well be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the proud Prie&s;ts of BAAL or BAC|CHUS, by Pagan FLAMENS, or Mahometan MUFTIES.</P>
<P>So true is it, that Men who excel in other Re|&s;pects, nay, &s;hine in other Lights of Life, are fre|quently more deficient in that Addre&s;s, that mild Humanity, which wins the Affections of Mankind, than in Talents to rai&s;e them&s;elves to honourable Stations. The <HI>haughty</HI> and <HI>dogmatical</HI> are often &s;ub&s;tituted in the Room of the <HI>friendly, benevolent,</HI> and <HI>obliging.</HI> As to the Objection, that we might perhaps be over-bold with GREATNESS, and make Acquaintance with it in too familiar a Man|ner, if it was <HI>humble</HI> and <HI>conde&s;cen&s;ive;</HI> I an&s;wer, it may be ju&s;t with re&s;pect to tho&s;e Gentlemen who&s;e only Qualifications lie in Form and Di&s;tance, but not to tho&s;e of real Merit. A becoming Freedom, Simplicity, and Openne&s;s of Behaviour, methinks, when extended to Men of Sen&s;e and Prudence, will
<PB N="13" REF="64">never le&s;&s;en Greatne&s;s at all; but rather, like the regular APERTURES of a BUILDING, add Beauty to the WHOLE, without dimini&s;hing the Strength of any PART of it.</P>
<P>THE &s;uperior Clergy &s;hould be the Support and Ornament of the Prie&s;thood; they are placed in higher Orbs, not that, like METEORS, their ominous Blaze &s;hould be the Gaze and Terror of their le&s;s happy Brethren; but that, like STARS, they may illuminate and beautify, animate and impregnate the inferior World: For they, like THEM, &s;hould have an enlarg'd Pro&s;pect, a &s;wift and con&s;tant Motion, a bountiful and benign In|fluence.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;<HI>BUT</HI> Man, proud Man,</L>
<L>Dre&s;t in a little brief Authority,</L>
<L>Mo&s;t ignorant of what he's mo&s;t a&s;&s;ur'd,</L>

<P><PB N="14" REF="65">
A LARGE Share of this INDECORUM of Behaviour belongs to tho&s;e, I believe, who have contracted the Rever&s;e of Affability and civil Manners in their INFANCY. For PRIDE is a Pa&s;&s;ion which, in&s;tead of being re&s;train'd, is u&s;ually indulged in Children: So that 'tis indeed no Wonder if the Effects of it are very unfortu|nately felt in SOCIETY. For it will be hard, perhaps, for one to give a Rea&s;on why that Tem|per which was u&s;ed to delight in In&s;ult over Ser|vants or Inferiors, in a Kitchen or a Nur&s;ery, &s;hould not afterwards be the Occa&s;ion of equal Mi&s;chief in the Publick it&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT has been known likewi&s;e to be perfectly reigning in tho&s;e, who have long indulg'd them|&s;elves in an habitual Moro&s;ene&s;s in a COLLEGE|LIFE. There are certain Negligences or PEC|CADILLOS in Behaviour towards Inferiors con|tracted <HI>there,</HI> which &s;ometimes reduce Gentlemen into a perfect Apathy towards others that are not their Equals in Birth, or Fortune, or Learning, or Preferments, ever afterwards. When we go to an
<PB N="15" REF="66">Univer&s;ity, we find that, as FORTUNE holds the GLASS, Things have quite different Faces in the Imaginations of many of the graver &s;ort of Academicks: We find that there is &s;carce one in five of the FELLOWS of a COLLEGE can be tolerably civil to any Gentleman of le&s;s Rank than a NOBLEMAN, a GENTLEMAN-COMMONER, or a GRADUATE. Hence 'tis, that others catch the Infection; Noblemen, or Gentlemen-Com|moners, will only keep Company with the FEL|LOWS, or with one another; a Graduate with a Graduate, or Men of the &s;ame &s;tanding. So that by the&s;e fooli&s;h Di&s;tinctions, the poor SCHOLAR or SERVITOR in a tatter'd Gown, tho' of ever &s;o much Merit, has rarely, but very rarely, the Benefit of keeping Company with his Superiors; which, I mu&s;t own, I mention with Concern, as 'tis a great Di&s;advantage to Youth when they fir&s;t go to an Univer&s;ity, and would gladly learn MANNERS, as well as SCIENCES. If a poor Scholar &s;hould happen to neglect or forget the Ceremony of putting off his CAP in pa&s;&s;ing one of the FELLOWS in the COLLEGE-QUADRANGLE,
<PB N="16" REF="67">'tis a thou&s;and to one but he is made to fa&s;t that Day by being put out of COMMONS, or el&s;e he perceives his Mi&s;take not only <HI>in</HI> his Dinner, but <HI>at</HI> it likewi&s;e. For if the proud Gentleman that thinks him&s;elf &s;lighted, &s;hould happen to &s;it PROVOST-PLACE, as they call it, he &s;its at the Head of his Table in all the Agonies of conceal'd Ill-nature, and his Di&s;cour&s;e is made up of half Sentences, and dark Allu&s;ions, both di&s;agreeable and unintelligible to all pre&s;ent; &s;o that the Scholars that wait at Table, can only &s;tare each other wildly in the Face, and &s;tand with a mali|cious Sneer, wi&s;hing the Dinner was over, and in|wardly commi&s;erating the Condition of one ano|ther. When Gentlemen of &s;uch a &s;aturnine Com|plection retire from the Exerci&s;e of magi&s;terial Authority over a few poor Scholars, and enter in|to Life, their Behaviour is commonly attended with a great many di&s;agreeable Sullenne&s;&s;es towards their Inferiors, or Dependants, upon the &s;lighte&s;t Di&s;plea&s;ure; nay, whether in or out of Humour, they have contracted &s;uch an Aver&s;ion to tatter'd Robes, that, for the mo&s;t part, they fly the Society
<PB N="17" REF="68">of the POOR. Such Men forget, that they give the World the &s;ame Advantage over their RE|PUTATION, which a more criminal Conduct would do.&mdash;</P>
<Q>&mdash; Hae Nugoe &s;eria ducunt in Mala.</Q>
<P>THE young Gentleman therefore that goes to an Univer&s;ity has great Need of Coun&s;el and Di|rection. I would have him con&s;ult GOD in the fir&s;t Place, and next, the mo&s;t humble, the mo&s;t devout, and experienc'd Tutor and Companions he can find out. For he &s;tands in a Place where many Ways meet; and if he takes the Wrong, he will certainly wander far, and it may be, never re|cover the right. He may float a long, long while, upon the BILLOWS of PRIDE and FOLLY, before he recovers the Haven of WISDOM and HUMILITY.</P>
<P>How con&s;iderable a Part of Happine&s;s is lo&s;t by tho&s;e, who &s;eem by the Eminence of their Condition to be above <HI>ordinary</HI> human Commerce,
<PB N="18" REF="69">and who affect a &s;ort of di&s;tant Strangene&s;s towards their Inferiors, will be ea&s;ily apprehended by one who is not exceedingly ill-natur'd. Such a re|ferv'd, uncommunicative, unfriendly Greatne&s;s, mu&s;t, of all others, be the mo&s;t di&s;ta&s;teful and gloomy State. Nor can it po&s;&s;ibly be e&s;teem'd other than &s;ound and thorough Wretchedne&s;s, a grating and di&s;gu&s;tful Feeling, without the lea&s;t Mixture of any thing &s;oft, gentle, or agreeable. How great mu&s;t be the Shocks of Di&s;appointment, the Stings of Affront, and the Agonies of a work|ing Antipathy, again&s;t the multiply'd Objects of Offence, to the haughty proud Man, who with a &s;evere A&s;pect, and a pompous lofty Tone of Au|thority, guards his Greatne&s;s, as a gruff Bully does a Mi&s;tre&s;s? Wherever &s;uch a Creature turns him|&s;elf, which ever Way he ca&s;ts his Eye, every thing around him mu&s;t appear gha&s;tly and horrid; every thing ho&s;tile, and, as it were, <HI>bent</HI> again&s;t a private and &s;ingle Being, who is thus divided by PRIDE from every thing <HI>beneath</HI> him, and has nothing &s;oft or plea&s;ing from the Side of FRIEND|SHIP in the INFERIOR WORLD. How little
<PB N="19" REF="70">does &s;uch a Mortal know the Extent, and Power, and Plea&s;ure of HUMILITY, and to what an heroick Pitch a Soul may ri&s;e, which feels the thorough Force of it? Never was Humility prac|ti&s;ed but with increa&s;ing Joy, which makes the Practi&s;er &s;till more in Love with the fair Act. It leaves behind it the Perception of a delicious Ea&s;e, and an Overflowing of &s;oft and plea&s;ing Sen&s;ation. I would to GOD, that enormous Pride and Di&s;tance did never appear among us, that Humi|lity and a ju&s;t Reverence for Mankind, and Civi|lity and affable Manners, did alway take place. We &s;hould then feel nothing but the enlivening Influence of the benevolent and obliging, the cour|teous and unre&s;erv'd Temper, which is a perfect Stranger to the untoward Delights of a di&s;&s;ocial Community.</P>

<P>ANOTHER Virtue we are particularly to practi&s;e is PATIENCE; for, I am &s;ure, no Order of Men in the World have more Occa&s;ion to exerci&s;e it. If we &s;hould give way to Pa&s;&s;ion and Peevi&s;hne&s;s, our whole Life would be one continual Fret. We had need of a great deal of Patience in the In&s;truction and Admonition of tho&s;e that are under our Care; to &s;ee what &s;low Progre&s;s they make in the Know|ledge of divine Truths; how perver&s;e the younger
<PB N="22" REF="73">&s;ort are to learn their Duty, and how refractory and &s;tubborn the elder are to retain their vicious Habits; with how great a Facility even Chil|dren can apprehend any thing that is lewd and wicked, and how dull and &s;tupid their very Parents are whil&s;t we are preaching to them what is good; how that when we &s;peak to them in Demon&s;tra|tion and Power, making out to them as clear as the SUN, the Agreeablene&s;s, the Plea&s;ure and Happine&s;s of a virtuous Cour&s;e of Life, and the inevitable Mi&s;ery of a bad one; and when to this, we farther add the Efforts of a pious Zeal, and the Charms of a grateful Eloquence; and yet, not|with&s;tanding all this, to make no more Impre&s;&s;ion upon their Hearts, than the STROKES do upon the harden'd ANVIL.&mdash;We had need be con|&s;iderable Ma&s;ters of this Virtue, when we find how many Men are become our Enemies, becau&s;e we tell them the Truth; that when we preach up Re|ligion and Virtue, we are look'd upon as &s;o many knavi&s;h Cheats and Impo&s;tors by the Athei&s;tical and Prophane; whil&s;t we endeavour to maintain the Unity and Apo&s;tolick Government of our
<PB N="23" REF="74">Church, whil&s;t we warn Men of the great Danger of an unrea&s;onable Separation, we are traduced by the re&s;olv'd Schi&s;matick as the Agents of ROME, and the Advocates only of a more covert and di&s;|guis'd Popery; that when we teach the Quiet and Peaceablene&s;s of Primitive Chri&s;tianity, the Guilt and Danger of Faction and Rebellion, to think we &s;hould be cen&s;ur'd, for the Mi&s;carriages of &s;ome this Way, as the Mercenaries of Government, and the Promoters of a de&s;potick Power. To think farther yet, how the INFERIOR CLERGY &s;hould be &s;et up as the Mark of Ridicule and Contempt; that they &s;hould have Rea&s;on to complain of more Grievances, than their Superiors can boa&s;t of Im|munities; that no Inju&s;tices are &s;o frequently com|mitted, nor &s;o hardly redre&s;s'd, as what are done to them; that they &s;hould, in many Places, be the Sport of the Gentry, and be liable to all the un|mannerly Mirth of the Commonalty; that their very Name &s;hould pa&s;s for a Je&s;t, and every thing, tho' never &s;o nau&s;eou&s;ly &s;illy, when they are the Subject, pre&s;ently commence Wit, and go for a Thing that is well &s;aid.&mdash;Now to be able to con|flict
<PB N="24" REF="75">with the&s;e and many more Grievances and Difficulties in the Exerci&s;e of our Office, we mu&s;t be arm'd with a great deal of PATIENCE, and wait for a Recompence in another World for our SUFFERINGS here: THIS, and this only, has kept up the Spirits of my Neighbour EULALIUS.</P>
<P>EULALIUS may be &s;aid now to be one of your very rich Clergymen not worth a Groat; who is little known, and much e&s;teem'd by his few Friends; thankful for what Mercies he receives, and humble under Cha&s;ti&s;ement: He is de&s;pis'd by the World for his Poverty; and pities the World for its Weakne&s;s; is a Friend to Mankind, and an Enemy to nothing but Vice. A LADY of his Acquaintance told him one Day &s;he was &s;orry he had the Misfortune of being &s;o <HI>poorly</HI> provided for in the Church, and a&s;k'd him if he had no better <HI>Chance</HI> for Preferment? <Q>CHANCE, MISFOR|TUNE, and <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad</HI> Luck, MADAM, re|plied he, are Words without a Meaning, or they &s;ignify the Direction of PROVIDENCE. If you have no Meaning in the&s;e Words, you
<PB N="25" REF="76">tell me you are &s;orry for nothing; if you have, 'tis impious; for 'tis thinking the Source of MERCY cruel. But, as I think better of you, I take them to be Words of Cour&s;e. He who depends on Providence can never want a Support: But &s;ay we are neglected, and all our Endeavours for a decent Support prove fruitle&s;s. He who con&s;iders that Death will &s;oon relieve him, will by that Reflection not be di&s;may'd, but find his Con&s;tancy &s;upported.</Q></P>

<P><Q>WERE the good and virtuous of Mankind, MADAM, wholly pro&s;perous in this Life; did Goodne&s;s never meet with Oppo&s;ition, or Merit lie under a Cloud, where would be the Trial, Victory, or Crown of VIRTUE? Where would the Virtues have their Theatre, or whence their
<PB N="26" REF="77">Names? Where would be TEMPERANCE or SELF-DENIAL? Where PATIENCE, MEEKNESS, MAGNANIMITY? Whence would the&s;e have their Being? What Merit ex|cept from Hard&s;hip? What VIRTUE without a Conflict?</Q></P>
<P>EULALIUS, tho' in the&s;e low Circum&s;tances, is often telling his Friends that he is very <HI>happy,</HI>&mdash;

and that he looks upon his Condition to be for the <HI>be&s;t;</HI> which puts me in mind of a Gentleman who, coming from IRELAND to ENGLAND, and go|ing into the Packet-Boat, and the Entering-Rope breaking, fell into the Pinnace, and broke his Leg. "Well, &s;aid he, 'tis all for the better." His Friends a&s;k'd him, how he could think break|ing his Leg, attended with the Lo&s;s of his Voyage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> could be for the better? <Q>PRO|VIDENCE,
<PB N="27" REF="78">VIDENCE, replied he, knows be&s;t: I am &s;till of Opinion, 'tis for the better.</Q> He was car|ried back, the Packet-Boat &s;ail'd, founder'd in her Pa&s;&s;age, and but one Man was &s;av'd.</P>
<P>AND here 'tis plea&s;ant to ob&s;erve, that tho' the Pavilion of the ALMIGHTY be thick Clouds, and he walks upon the Wings of the Wind; tho' his Providence be a great Aby&s;s, and the Swiftne&s;s and Secrecy of his Actings elude our Search, and baffle our Enquiries, &s;o that we cannot di&s;cern when he acts by PREROGATIVE, when by LAW; yet, as is plain from this Relation, he does frequently exert a &s;upernatural Force and Virtue for our Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>A LOW Condition in the World &s;eems to all (my Friend!) a terrible Misfortune; its Sound is &s;o, and that's all. Life, methinks, is various enough, and if one Livelihood fails, another may &s;ucceed: If one Rank of Life cannot be &s;upported, a Clergyman may flouri&s;h very well in another. 'Tis but de&s;cending a Step lower, and the Event
<PB N="28" REF="79">would abundantly atone for the Conde&s;cen&s;ion. 'Tis well known the MERCANTILE WORLD is indebted to an ingenious poor Clergyman, to his neglected Merit, for the curious Invention of the STOCKING FRAME; being out of Bread, and ignorant of any Means of Sub&s;i&s;tence by DI|VINITY, he liv'd for &s;ome Time upon what his Wife got by KNITTING; and by curiou&s;ly ob|&s;erving the playing of the Needles whil&s;t &s;he was at Work, he framed in his Mind the famous Mo|del of the Frame, which has &s;ince prov'd of &s;uch &s;ingular Advantage to that Branch of the BRITISH Manufactures, that it affords good Bread to Thou|&s;ands.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER a little Story of a Gentleman of GASCOIGNE, who inherited two thou&s;and Crowns a-year from his Father, commenced MAR|QUIS at PARIS, and, being a very volatile Ge|nius, &s;oon got the better of his Fortune, and was reduced to the lowe&s;t Ebb of Wretchedne&s;s. Yet, in the Mid&s;t of it, he never lo&s;t his Spirit and Courage, or impotently repin'd at what was not
<PB N="29" REF="80">to be remedy'd: But, with the &s;mall Pittance he had left, purcha&s;ed a MULE, and turn'd WA|TER-CARRIER. Some Time after which, as he was trafficking his Merchandize up and down the Streets, he happened to meet two of his old Companions, who would have avoided him for fear of giving him Pain, at being caught in &s;uch an Equipage. But he prevented them, &s;prung forward to &s;alute them with his u&s;ual Freedom, and when they &s;eem'd to pity his ill Fortune, bri&s;kly interrupted them by &s;aying,&mdash;That he had Forty thou&s;and Crowns Worth of Water in the SEYNE, but, for want of Servants, he was obli|ged to &s;ell it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I AM afraid very few among us in Di&s;tre&s;s di&s;|play &s;uch a Fortitude and Greatne&s;s of Soul; our Pride will not &s;uffer us to do it; and we rather chu&s;e to have that very Pride wounded every Day in our Lives, by laying our&s;elves open to the rich Man's Contumely, to In&s;ults and new Grievance, in intreating Obligations; to endure which with PATIENCE &s;hould be beneath the Spirit of the
<PB N="30" REF="81">SACRED ORATOR. As to all other Sufferings we may rejoice in them with EULALIUS, and, with our BLESSED LORD, endure the CROSS and de&s;pi&s;e the SHAME.</P>

Becau&s;e I am per&s;uaded that nothing can be more worthy my princely Station and Fortune than relieving the oppre&s;&s;ive Poverty of Men of Merit, who have preferred Glory to the heaping up of Riches. I look upon this as a mo&s;t glorious Act; as an Act by which a Prince rai&s;es the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Monuments of his Royal Magnificence, and offers the mo&s;t &s;olemn and acceptable Sacrifice to the Gods. Therefore, if you will allow me to a&s;&s;i&s;t you with my Riches, I &s;hall e&s;teem it as a Benefit receiv'd rather than be&s;tow'd.</Q></P>
<P>To which C. FABRICIUS, after a &s;hort Si|lence, an&s;wered,&mdash; <Q>MY POVERTY is &s;o far
<PB N="42" REF="93">from being a Burthen or Inconvenience to me, that, on the contrary, whenever I compare my|&s;elf to the Rich, my Condition &s;eems to be in|finitely happier; and I number my&s;elf among&s;t tho&s;e few, who&s;e Lot it is to enjoy all the Fe|licity po&s;&s;ible in this Life; and when thus rank'd, I feel the greate&s;t inward Delight, and am thankful for my Poverty. For while I deem it idle and fooli&s;h to covet Superfluity, and my little Field, when well cultivated and laid out, affords me all Nece&s;&s;aries, I know not for what Purpo&s;e I ought to be &s;olicitous about greater Wealth. For all Nouri&s;hment is mo&s;t plea&s;ant to me when &s;ea&s;on'd with Hunger; and all Drink grateful when I am a-dry. I procure my&s;elf ea&s;y and quiet Sleep by Labour. If my Cloaths keep out Cold I am &s;atisfied with them: In Hou&s;hold-Furniture I like that be&s;t, which is mo&s;t fit and convenient for the U&s;e to which it is applied, and at the &s;ame Time cheape&s;t. Wherefore I &s;hould be doubly un|ju&s;t, if I &s;hould accu&s;e FORTUNE for not having afforded me more Riches, than my
<PB N="43" REF="94">NATURE requires, which neither in&s;pires me with a De&s;ire of Superfluities, or Dexterity to procure them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEREFORE with this Indigence of mine, I look upon my&s;elf as richer than the mo&s;t opu|lent of other Men, nay, than even you your&s;elf; for I have &s;o much, that I can de&s;ire no more; as to you, would you have come over to ITALY, if you had not thought your&s;elf poor, notwith|&s;tanding you po&s;&s;e&s;s EPIRUS and other Do|minions? Ay, but &s;ay you, Wealth fairly en|ables us to do Good to others! and my Poverty puts it out of my Power to help any one! But truly this gives me no more Trouble, than that I am not more than ordinary furni&s;h'd with other Things; that GOD hath not granted me un|common KNOWLEDGE, nor the Art of PRO|PHECY, for the Benefit of tho&s;e who want them; nor many other excellent Endowments. And if I employ the Talents I po&s;&s;e&s;s for the Intere&s;t of my native State and Friends, if by a&s;&s;i&s;ting every Man in every re&s;pect that I am
<PB N="44" REF="95">capable, I &s;uffer my good Offices to extend to all, I think hitherto I am free from Crime on this Score.

<P>WE mu&s;t likewi&s;e, DEAR SIR, be extreamly delicate in our Choice of DIVERSIONS; we mu&s;t often tread in the rugged Tract even when there is little Occa&s;ion for it; DESIRE mu&s;t be fre|quently confin'd within the Circle pre&s;crib'd by CUSTOM only, when there would be really no Harm with Decency to indulge it. For, tho' in the very Road to Virtue, there are &s;everal PRIM|ROSE-PATHS, (to u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion of LAERTES in SHAKESPEARE) which may invite the Step, without leading ab&s;olutely out of the Road it&s;elf,
<PB N="61" REF="112">or offering any indecent Pro&s;pect to the View; yet the World expects a CLERGYMAN &s;hould tread the direct Road, without going to the Right or Left, for fear he &s;hould wander too far, or trip in the Circumflex.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH a Fondne&s;s for the Entertain|ments of the STAGE is the prevailing Temper of the Age we live in, yet it would but ill become us to give any Encouragement to them. For the fal&s;e Notions of Honour there propagated, the agreeable Shade which is ca&s;t over unlawful Love, and the Ridicule and Contempt with which all Se|riou&s;ne&s;s and Religion is generally treated, makes me think it too dangerous for the young, and un|becoming the old. The Gay, the Polite, and the Witty, may perhaps run the Rigg upon us, the Toupees may laugh at us, and the Ladies frown upon us, if we do not make a Party with them to the Play-hou&s;e, but we mu&s;t not regard that. I am, indeed, a&s;ham'd to tell you, that a Man may read the COMEDIES of the ancient HEATHENS with le&s;s Offence to his Mode&s;ty and Virtue, than
<PB N="62" REF="113">tho&s;e of modern CHRISTIANS. A vicious Sen|timent in a theatrical Performance at ATHENS would have co&s;t the Poet his Liberty or Life. When EURIPIDES made one of his Actors &s;ay, &mdash; <Q>Riches are the &s;upreme Good, and with Rea&s;on excite the Admiration of Gods and Men;</Q>&mdash;the whole Theatre ro&s;e upon him, and he had been bani&s;hed immediately, if he had not de&s;ired Patience till the End of the Play, where the Speaker of this Sentence peri&s;hes mi&s;erably. Were the Stage under proper Regulations, it would be a rational and agreeable Entertainment, and I cannot &s;ee why a Clergyman, as well as ano|ther Per&s;on, might not then go to a Play; it might then as much help, as it now hinders the the Cau&s;e of VIRTUE.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t never frequent GAMING-HOUSES, to play at BILLIARDS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but fly from the Infection of them with Horror; 'tis really my Opinion, that this &s;ingle Depravity puts Thou&s;ands of People in the Kingdom to greater Expence,
<PB N="63" REF="114">than would maintain the SCIENCES in all their Glory.</P>
<P>GAMING was &s;o much di&s;-e&s;teem'd among the greate&s;t of Men formerly, that the King of PARTHIA is reported to have &s;ent a Bale of golden Dice to DEMETRIUS, on Purpo&s;e to upbraid his Incon&s;tancy. And COBILON, the LACEDEMONIAN, being &s;ent to CORINTH for obtaining a mutual League and Friend&s;hip between tho&s;e two Cities, when he &s;aw the Captains and Senators of CORINTH playing at Dice, returned without doing any Thing; &s;aying, that he would not &s;o much as tarni&s;h the Glory of the SPAR|TANS, as that it &s;hould be &s;aid, they had made a League with GAMESTERS.</P>
<P>I AM far from being an Enemy to the Enter|tainment of a CONCERT; I even think Mu&s;ick a Science peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary among&s;t us, to &s;often our rugged Genius, to prepare the Way to Polite|ne&s;s and Good-breeding. In HOMER we read of a HARPER to whom ALCINOES and
<PB N="64" REF="115">ULYSSES willingly lent their Ears. In VIR|GIL, JOPAS both &s;ings and plays, while DIDO and AENEAS give Attention. Such is the Force of Mu&s;ick, that ORPHEUS a&s;&s;uaged the Tem|pe&s;t of the ARGONAUTS with a Song; and, if there be any Authority in FABLES, we find that tho' ARGUS had his Head guarded with a hundred Eyes, yet they were all charm'd a&s;leep with the Sound of one &s;ingle PIPE.

But we may &s;ometimes, by our imprudent Free|doms, betray weaker Chri&s;tians into real Sin; they, for In&s;tance, by keeping the &s;ame Com|pany, or the &s;ame Hours, which we do, may act very wickedly; for 'tis not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that they &s;hould have &s;o much Metaphy&s;icks as to di|&s;tingui&s;h between an un&s;ea&s;onable Sitting for Di&s;|cour&s;e-&s;ake, or for Drink. We mu&s;t therefore abridge our&s;elves of many little Liberties which other Men lawfully take, both in our Words and Behaviour in Company. We mu&s;t avoid not only Guilt, but Scandal too; becau&s;e Scandal may do
<PB N="68" REF="119">as much Mi&s;chief in our Profe&s;&s;ion as Guilt, and Men will be as far from imitating our Practice, or practi&s;ing our Doctrines, if they believe us to be immoral, as if we were really &s;o. We mu&s;t at|temper our Di&s;cour&s;e over a GLASS with a de|cent Chearfulne&s;s, and, as it were, a plea&s;ant un|affected Seriou&s;ne&s;s. For by this we may even then, probably, obtain the Conver&s;ion of &s;ome mi&s;-guided Per&s;ons, who are aver&s;e to our Com|munion only for the general Neglect of this; or, at lea&s;t, we &s;hall gain their better Opinion, and we our&s;elves &s;hall not be the wor&s;e Men for it. I confe&s;s, the wicked Hypocri&s;y of tho&s;e pretended godly Mini&s;ters in CROMWELL'S Days, that were carrying on Rebellion and Sacrilege with &s;o much &s;anctimonious Preci&s;ene&s;s, has entailed &s;uch a la&s;ting Scandal upon the outward Form of GODLINESS, as hath made good Men ever &s;ince very cautious of u&s;ing it; but, in Oppo&s;ition to them, we have, perhaps, carried the Point too far on the other Side, we have given them Occa|&s;ion to cen&s;ure &s;ome of our FREEDOMS, as we have done their PRECISENESS. Very worthy
<PB N="69" REF="120">of our Attention is the Behaviour of ARISTIP|PUS.

<P>BECAUSE 'tis always expected, DEAR SIR, that Men of a liberal Education &s;hould be no Strangers to GOOD BREEDING, we mu&s;t, by no Means, neglect the Culture of that &s;ocial Vir|tue. &mdash;A VIRTUE that has all the Heightening of Embelli&s;hment and Gracefulne&s;s: 'Tis Bene|volence brought into Action with all the A&s;&s;em|blage of Propriety and Excellence: 'Tis the Friend of Society, and the Poli&s;h of Science: It regulates Life and Conduct, refines upon Happine&s;s, en|larges the Circle of Enjoyment, and is the Im|provement of Plea&s;ure: It obliges us to behave with Decency and Elegance, and quickens our At|tention
<PB N="70" REF="121">to the good Qualities of others. COM|PLAISANCE is, indeed, its Re&s;emblance; but only as a SHADOW is of a SUBSTANCE. It is only the Varni&s;h, the Ma&s;que of it. GOOD BREEDING is the real Ornament of the Soul, made vi&s;ible and &s;et in the faire&s;t Point of Light. Our modern Complai&s;ance, like fal&s;e WIT, has &s;omething glaring in it which &s;trikes the Injudici|ous with a kind of Admiration; but, like fal&s;e WIT, has no other Effect on People of Sen&s;e than to produce Ridicule and Contempt.</P>
<P>THE De&s;ign of SCHOOLS, the U&s;e of UNI|VERSITIES, the Benefit of CONVERSATION, &s;hould all, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, centre in this great Point&mdash;GOOD BREEDING. No one can be properly call'd a Gentleman, who has not made U&s;e of every Opportunity to enrich his own Ca|pacity, and &s;ettle the Elements of good Behaviour, which he may improve at Lei&s;ure. There are Numbers of Per&s;ons of our Profe&s;&s;ion, who may ju&s;tly claim Reputation for a &s;ingle Excellence, that in all others are defective and incon&s;iderable,
<PB N="71" REF="122">for the Want of this general Accompli&s;hment.&mdash; A Variety of Incidents agree to make the Want of it very common. Bad Principles of Education when at SCHOOL; an ill Choice of Acquaintance at entering into the UNIVERSITY; the unhappy Bluntne&s;s of TUTORS who undertake to inform us, and an untoward Di&s;po&s;ition of our own. But the Frequency or Confirmation of an Evil, &s;hould never di&s;courage us from endeavouring to &s;ur|mount it; and if it is grown quite de&s;perate, there is the more Nece&s;&s;ity for oppo&s;ing it with the greater Vigour. I mu&s;t own, that little Od|dities and Singularities of Behaviour in a Gentle|man of a liberal Education, who&s;e Mind is very much accu&s;tom'd to a Habit of Study and Thoughtfulne&s;s, may be &s;ometimes excu&s;ed with Candour and Indulgence; they may be only like Spots, perhaps, in the SUN, or A&s;perities in a DIAMOND; or may be as MOLES and DIMPLES, which hinder not a Face from being beautiful, tho' that Beauty be not regular; or of the Number of tho&s;e amiable Imperfections which we &s;ee in the

<P>THERE is another Particular, in my Opinion, DEAR SIR, of no &s;mall Con&s;equence to the Sup|port of our Character, and that is, to retain in our Memory our poor KINDRED and RELATIONS, tho' never &s;o remote; for nothing is more unbe|coming a Clergyman than a Forgetfulne&s;s either of his poor Friends or his Parents, which is always imputed to an affected, di&s;dainful Superiority and Pride.</P>

<PB N="73" REF="124">was Ma&s;ter of the Ship) in Company; the Son knew the Father, but the Father (who had lo&s;t him when a Youth many Years) knew not the Son, having given him up as dead long before, not hearing any thing of him. The Son &s;oon made him&s;elf known to the Father, who em|braced him with great Tenderne&s;s; but their Un|happine&s;s to meet in that Place was grievous to them both. The young Man addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to his Father in this Manner:&mdash; <Q>The Slavery you are going into will be in&s;upportable to you, and &s;oon put an End to your Life, the Thoughts of which is Death to me; I have been here a great many Years, and know the Country, the People, and their Work; if they will accept of me in your Room, I will go back into Slavery, and you &s;hall go Home again; I know, if it &s;hould plea&s;e GOD to enable you, I &s;hall be re|deem'd; if not, GOD'S Will be done.</Q> The Moors readily accepted the Exchange; &s;o the Fa|ther returned Home, and the Son back in his Stead into Slavery.</P>

The&s;e Fellows, without any Rea&s;on, took Offence at the generous Creature, and had once or twice attempted to wound his PROBOSCIS with their Awls. The noble Animal, who knew it was beneath him to cru&s;h them, did not di&s;dain to cha&s;ti&s;e them. He fill'd his large Mu&s;cular Trunk with a con&s;iderable Quantity of Water, not the cleane&s;t, and advancing to them, as u&s;ual, cover'd them at once with a dirty Flood.

<P>I SHALL now touch upon &s;ome general Qua|lifications which all that are of the Body of the Clergy, e&s;pecially in the&s;e Ages of Li|terature, ought to be furni&s;h'd with. And fir&s;t, a moderate Skill in PHILOSOPHY is requi&s;ite in our Profe&s;&s;ion. LOGICK, I think, is undeniably nece&s;&s;ary for every one who pretends to Learning, and Skill in the Arrangement and Di&s;po&s;ition of his Sentiments or Ideas. And if we would become Ma&s;ters of fine Rea&s;oning, we mu&s;t not only ap|ply
<PB N="94" REF="147">our&s;elves clo&s;ely to the Study of LOGICK, but al&s;o take Care that the Ari&s;totelian Authors we read be of the right &s;ort. This Country never produced a more mode&s;t, u&s;eful, or entertaining one to begin with, in my Opinion, than Dr WATTS. He &s;teers to the Coa&s;ts of this kind of Philo&s;ophy with as much Caution, as if he was afraid of &s;plitting upon the Rock of &s;ome unwar|rantable De&s;ire. And what I reckon is very much to his Prai&s;e, he never grows trifling, or troubles us with what is of no Importance; and has this Excellency be&s;ide, which few Authors of this Rank have, he writes in a Manner that is very taking and intelligible to young Gentlemen, and furni&s;hes them with all the nece&s;&s;ary Materials for their Improvement.</P>
<P>I HAVE always thought, that LOGICK would go down more glibly with mo&s;t of our young Students, e&s;pecially in &s;ome Colleges, if they were not cramm'd &s;o much with it. I am &s;en&s;ible it would &s;uit more with their Inclinations, and they would not &s;o often mutiny and declare War again&s;t

But, as to this Matter, I re&s;ign my Judgment, with entire Conde&s;cen&s;ion, to my Superiors. I &s;hall only add, that to me there appears to be a great Deal of Difference between the Practice of ARISTOTLE and our modern Schoolmen. He, by the &s;ame mental Eye with which he took in the Power and Quality of every Object in Nature, likewi&s;e &s;urvey'd the Properties of ELOQUENCE, which at the &s;ame Time had but a &s;econd Place in his E&s;teem; but the others, who are &s;uch dear Lovers of Di&s;putation, dwell almo&s;t upon that &s;ingle Province; they want the Prudence and good Sen&s;e of ARISTOTLE, tho' in this &s;ingle Point, they out-do him in Practice and Application.</P>

The vulgar METAPHYSICKS is e&s;&s;ential to Divinity as 'tis handled in later Ages; without &s;ome Portion of it, we cannot be able to di&s;pute, or write, or talk Divinity in pro|per Terms.

<P>WE of this Profe&s;&s;ion ought al&s;o to be qualify'd with a con&s;iderable Knowledge in the HOLY SCRIPTURES.

The Sounds of any mu&s;ical In&s;trument are in them&s;elves in&s;ig|nificant, yet by the Changes of the Air, the Agree|ment of the Chords, and Symphony of the Parts, they give extraordinary Plea&s;ure, as we daily ex|perience, to the Minds of an Audience.

But tho' fine Words are indeed the peculiar Light in which our Thoughts mu&s;t &s;hine, yet they &s;hould not every where &s;well and look big. For vulgar Terms are &s;ometimes much more &s;ignificant than the mo&s;t ornamental
<PB N="122" REF="178">can po&s;&s;ibly be. They are ea&s;ily under&s;tood, be|cau&s;e borrowed from common Life; and what is mo&s;t familiar to us, &s;oone&s;t engages our Belief. Some Writers very frequently make U&s;e of com|mon and vulgar Terms that have not the lea&s;t Air of Elegance to recommend them, yet by mu|&s;ically di&s;po&s;ing, and artfully connecting &s;uch Terms, they cloath their Periods in a kind of Pomp and Exaltation, and dexterou&s;ly conceal their intrin&s;ick Lowne&s;s.</P>
<P>'TIS ob&s;ervable, that &s;ome of our modern Preachers are more happy in the Stile, than in the Sentiments of their Sermons. Their Language is very often noble and &s;onorous, but the Sen&s;e either very trifling, or el&s;e &s;o ob&s;cur'd by the &s;ounding Phra&s;es, hard Metaphors, and forced Expre&s;&s;ions in which 'tis cloathed, that 'tis difficult to find it out. For my Part, I &s;hould prefer a noble Sentiment, that is depre&s;s'd with homely Language, infinitely before a vulgar one, that is blown up with all the Sound and Pomp of Expre&s;&s;ion. Sublime Thoughts, either by Means of a great Affinity they bear to
<PB N="123" REF="179">the Springs and Movements of our Souls, or by their own &s;uperlative Lu&s;tre, always out-&s;hine the Artifices of Rhetorick, who&s;e Appearance they cover with a Veil of &s;uperior Beauties. For as the STARS are quite dimm'd and ob&s;cur'd, when the SUN breaks out in all its blazing Rays, &s;o pompous Phra&s;es, and towering lofty Expre&s;&s;ions, are entirely over&s;hadowed by the &s;uperior Splen|dor of noble Sentiments.</P>
<P>To the Formation of a Stile, our Reading and Imitation, if they be of the right &s;ort, mu&s;t prin|cipally contribute. Whatever Sermons we hear, or however polite and agreeable their Characters may be who preach them, if the Authors we read or imitate are of another kind, we &s;hall find our Pa|late &s;trangely turn'd their Way. We are unhap|pier in this re&s;pect, for being Scholars and Imi|tators, if our Studies and Patterns be ill cho&s;en. Nor can I, for this Rea&s;on, think it proper to call a Man <HI>well-read,</HI> who reads and imitates many Authors; &s;ince he mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity have more ill Models than good, and be more &s;tuffed with
<PB N="124" REF="180">Bomba&s;t, ill Fancy, and wry Thought, than fill'd with &s;olid Sen&s;e, and ju&s;t Imagination.</P>
<P>THO' to pa&s;s a right Judgment upon Compo|&s;itions is generally the Effect of a long Experi|ence, and the la&s;t Improvement of Study and Ob|&s;ervation, yet, &s;ince you reque&s;t it, I &s;hall give you my Opinion concerning as many Authors in our Profe&s;&s;ion, as I think it needful for you to read at pre&s;ent, and you may &s;ingle out which you plea&s;e for your Imitation.</P>
<P>IF you would have your Under&s;tanding charm|ed, your Affections captivated, and your Pa&s;&s;ions directed and re&s;trained by the Powers of Rheto|rick, you mu&s;t read DR TILLOTSON. There is Gracefulne&s;s, there is Strength, there is Spirit, there is Dignity in all he &s;ays. Such a divine Power and Energy, I think, never di&s;play'd it&s;elf in &s;o ea&s;y and genteel a Flow, and Command of Sentiment and Expre&s;&s;ion, as the Sermons of this excellent Prelate.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="181">DR SOUTH has brought in a Species of Elo|quence in his Sermons, that is almo&s;t peculiar to him&s;elf, and rarely to be met with among our Di|vines. He abounds with Turns of Wit, which are inexpre&s;&s;ibly fine; and is prodigiou&s;ly dextrous at Irony or Sneer. His Strokes of Raillery are va&s;tly genteel, appo&s;ite and proper. In Matters of Controver&s;y, with what Humour does he ri|dicule his Adver&s;aries, and with what Dexterity does he &s;ting in the Mid&s;t of a Smile! How &s;kil|ful at managing an Argument!

His Stile particu|larly excells in Smoothne&s;s, and an ea&s;y and peace|able Flow of the Words, and yet it has &s;uch an Elevation as to excite an extraordinary Emotion in tho&s;e e&s;pecially who are to be brought over by &s;oft and gentle In&s;inuation.</P>
<P>BISHOP PEARSON'S Book on the CREED is a compleat and delicate Performance; tho' he launches out into the Depths of Divinity, and &s;oars to the &s;ublime&s;t Eminence, yet he never drops, like many others, unfortunately down, but &s;till pre&s;erves his own intrin&s;ick Grandeur. His Arguments run rapidly along, immediately &s;trike the Imagination, inflame us with the Warmth and Fire of his own Genius, and carry all before them by the Weight and Solemnity of Thought and Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;omething extraordinary, &s;omething
<PB N="127" REF="185">more than humanly great in Dr ATTERBURY's Sermons. And for this Rea&s;on has the inimi|table and godlike Mr POPE, unmov'd by Par|tiality and unbia&s;s'd by Envy, awarded the Law|rels to this great Author, which flouri&s;h &s;till green, and will flouri&s;h as long as the Name of POPE has an harmonious Sound to an ENGLISH Ear. To write in a Language that is graceful and proper, that is di&s;tingui&s;h'd by certain ma&s;terly Touches, and an artful Poli&s;h, that would have &s;hone in the Days of ATTICK Elegance, is the peculiar Cha|racter of Dr ATTERBURY.</P>
<P>IN pa&s;&s;ing their Judgment of Dr CLARK'S Sermons, Men commonly mu&s;ter his Imperfec|tions, &s;o that the Remembrance of his Faults &s;ticks indelibly in their Minds, and that of his Ex|cellencies is quickly worn out. For my Part, tho' I cannot by any Means be blind or partial to his Faults, I have always thought that his Sermons are very grand and beautiful Compo&s;itions: not like tho&s;e of a low and grov'ling Genius, who
<PB N="128" REF="186">never endangers him&s;elf by aiming at Grandeur, but &s;till goes on in the &s;ame uniform &s;ecure Track. The whole Univer&s;e is &s;carce &s;ufficient for the ex|ten&s;ive Reach and piercing Speculation of Dr CLARK'S Under&s;tanding. His lofty Genius is frequently a&s;piring to prodigious and amazing Heights, which expo&s;e him to &s;udden Falls; and &s;uch Falls &s;ometimes work the Good of Men. And be&s;ides, in the Judgment of the be&s;t Cri|ticks, what is truly grand in the Mid&s;t of &s;ome Faults, is preferable to that, which has nothing extraordinary in its be&s;t Parts, correct however throughout, and faultle&s;s.</P>
<P>FOR a &s;mooth and polite Stile Mr SEED is very much admir'd. That Theology of the Schools which he found undower'd, as it were, unattended, and in a Di&s;habille, he has enrich'd with all the Wealth, the Pride and Ornament of Language.

<P>I DO not know of an Author that meets with more general Applau&s;e than<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Archdeacon of <HI>Carli&s;le.</HI></NOTE> Mr LAW. Per|&s;ons

<P>WHEN you have a competent Share of ac|quir'd as well as natural Ta&s;te, my Friend, you may ea&s;ily di&s;cover the Value of any Performance your&s;elf from a bare Recital of it. For if it is in|trin&s;ically good, the Mind is naturally elevated by it, and &s;o &s;en&s;ibly affected with its lively Strokes, that it &s;wells with Tran&s;port and an inward Pride, as if what had been only heard had been the Pro|duct of its own Invention. But if we find that it tran&s;ports not the Soul, nor exalts our Thoughts, that it calls not up into our Minds Ideas more en|larged than what the mere Sound of the Words convey, but on attentive Examination its Dignity le&s;&s;ens and declines, we may conclude, that what|ever pierces no deeper than the Ears, can never de&s;erve our Applau&s;e or Imitation.</P>
<P>THESE few Authors I have named to you, ac|cording
<PB N="131" REF="189">to their Time and Age, have provided us with the riche&s;t ORE. To their eternal Honour they have attempted to throw off the horrid Di&s;|cord of antiquated Pro&s;e, fal&s;e Grandeur, Impo|tence and Puerility of Sentiments. They have happily broken the Ice for tho&s;e who are to follow them, and who treading in their Foot&s;teps, may at Lei&s;ure heighten and poli&s;h the ENGLISH Language, lead the Ear and Under&s;tanding to finer Plea&s;ure, and find out the true, perma|nent, harmonious Idiom, which alone can &s;atisfy a ju&s;t Judgment, and godlike Apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>WHENEVER we are engaged in Compo&s;itions of the genteeler kind, &s;uch as require Grandeur of Stile and exalted Sentiments, it will then be of excellent U&s;e to rai&s;e in our&s;elves &s;uch Reflections as the&s;e.&mdash;How in this Ca&s;e would Dr TILLOT|SON, or Dr SOUTH, have rais'd their Thoughts? &mdash;How would Dr SHARP, Dr PEARSON, or Dr ATTERBURY? For the&s;e celebrated Preach|ers, being propos'd by us for our Pattern and Imitation, will in &s;ome Degree lift up our Souls to

Or what Judgment would they pa&s;s upon it? How would they have expre&s;s'd them&s;elves? It is really a noble Enterprize to frame &s;uch a Theatre and Tribunal to &s;it on our own Compo&s;itions, and &s;ubmit them to a Scrutiny, in which &s;uch eminent Writers mu&s;t pre&s;ide as our Judges, and be at the &s;ame Time our Evidence. By this Method we mu&s;t inevitably arrive at &s;uch a Perfection of Stile, as to be able to give the ENGLISH Language its due MUSCLING, as the PAINTERS &s;ay of a good PIECE, its due Body and Proportion, and al&s;o the natural Orna|ments of Correctne&s;s, Simplicity, and Grace.&mdash; But of this more in my next Letter.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO give Maje&s;ty, Sweetne&s;s, Politene&s;s to a Di&s;cour&s;e, to make it &s;trike, to give it the fini&s;hing Touches of Eloquence, to work it up with as much of the Pathetick as is needful, we mu&s;t have a moderate Skill in POE|TRY. A Man mu&s;t be &s;o much of a Poet at lea&s;t, as to be able to diver&s;ify his Stile with the fine&s;t FLOWERS of Sentiment and Expre&s;&s;ion. But they mu&s;t not run thro' the whole of a Di&s;cour&s;e, but only &s;uch particular Places as that they may
<PB N="134" REF="192">&s;erve, like JEWELS and DISTINCTIONS in DRESS. For the finical Ornaments of a Di&s;|cour&s;e, and a continued Affectation of Excellence, gives Di&s;gu&s;t; 'tis not only unplea&s;ant to the Ear, but al&s;o to the Intellectual Faculties. The &s;ame Ob&s;ervation holds as to our other Sen&s;es; we are le&s;s pleas'd with tho&s;e FLOWERS and PLANTS that have too high a Perfume and Fragrance, than tho&s;e that have but a moderate Scent; and one would rather chu&s;e to &s;mell at the ROSE, than the MUSK-CRANESBILL. Even in the hand|ling FRUIT there is a Degree of Softne&s;s and Smoothne&s;s. So a Sermon or Di&s;cour&s;e, if it has an undiver&s;ify'd Height'ning and Embelli&s;hment of Stile, affords no la&s;ting Plea&s;ure. Be&s;ides, if it have all the Advantage of Poetical Colouring, it ought to have &s;ome Shade, that that which is illuminated may ca&s;t a greater Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>IF we would embelli&s;h our Stile by the Sub|&s;tance as it were, and Ground-colouring of Poe|tical Sublimity and Grandeur, we mu&s;t apply our|&s;elves diligently to the Study of the HOLY SCRIP|TURES.
<PB N="135" REF="193">It would be worth our while to dige&s;t them &s;o in our Minds, as to have them almo&s;t by Heart. For we &s;hould have both nobler Senti|ments and Expre&s;&s;ions if we apply'd &s;acred to prophane Eloquence.</P>
<P>THE Effect and Beauty of SACRED POE|TRY you will perceive, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, tho' im|perfectly, from the two following SPECIMENS. I have cho&s;e the Pathetick Kind, and &s;tudy'd to re|pre&s;ent the Amiablene&s;s of Virtue, by &s;uch Foils and Contrarieties as DAVID, the Man after GOD'S own Heart, furni&s;hes us with, and which &s;erve as Graces, if I may &s;o &s;peak, in poetical Limning, and render this Mu&s;ick of the Pa&s;&s;ions more &s;era|phick, powerful and enchanting. Had this been attempted by &s;ome abler Hand, you would have been led with Delight and Rapture, Anxiety and Concern, by Turns, thro' the Labyrinth of the Affections, and intere&s;ted, whether you would or no, in the Pa&s;&s;ions of the ROYAL PENITENT: And in the EXHORTATION annexed, you would pre&s;ently have under&s;tood the Reality of
<PB N="136" REF="194">tho&s;e Charms in the SACRED WRITINGS, which by my weak Endeavours, perhaps, you will imagine not to be half &s;o commanding, natural, and &s;o powerful, or capable of plea&s;ing a judicious polite Ear, and Mu&s;e-like Under&s;tanding.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE of this Profe&s;&s;ion ought to have a becoming Smoothne&s;s of Deli|very, and a lively &s;pirited Man|ner of Expre&s;&s;ion. There are &s;ome Men &s;o har&s;h, &s;o clowni&s;h, &s;o effeminate in their Tone of Voice, &s;o &s;tuttering, &s;o drawling, and &s;piritle&s;s in their Expre&s;&s;ion, &s;o ungraceful, aukward, and &s;lovenly in their Manner of &s;peaking, that they can never be heard di&s;cour&s;ing even on the mo&s;t important Subjects with Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="244">AND here we may perceive the Capital Mi&s;take of tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the Education of Youth; they frequently advi&s;e Parents to breed up their Sons to the Church, without ever con&s;ulting their Abilities or Inclinations. The forming of Youth was reckon'd a Matter of that Con&s;equence by the polite ATHENIANS, that the Education of their Children was under the Direction of particu|lar INSPECTORS and CENSORS, accountable to the STATE. And indeed it requires the great|e&s;t Delicacy and Strength of Mind to perform &s;o difficult and arduous a Ta&s;k as it ought. 'Tis exceedingly hard, in the Beginning e&s;pecially, to pry into the Souls of young Per&s;ons, and di&s;cover the different Bent of Genius in each; not to &s;ay that the DAWN of Genius is often as flattering as the SERENITY of an APRIL MORNING, or the Bloom of a forward FLOWER, &s;een and admired one Moment, and lo&s;t in the next.</P>
<P>A Ma&s;ter or Tutor ought above all Things to have a &s;pecial Attention to the Ca&s;t of Genius with which Nature has endow'd his Pulpils or
<PB N="191" REF="245">Scholars. For we perceive that in the ARTS, the &s;ame Schools, as it were, furni&s;h, and the &s;ame CRAFTSMEN and MECHANICKS form, Scholars in the &s;everal Arts, each unlike the one to the other, yet all of them excellent in their Kind; therefore the Tutor or Teacher ought to accom|modate his Manner to the &s;everal Capacities of Youth. He mu&s;t try what becomes them be&s;t, what Lenghts they can go with regard to their Voice, their Strength, their Lungs; and if he finds they have any thing downright aver&s;e in their Natures for the Attainments nece&s;&s;ary in our Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, or any thing &s;hocking in their Manner of &s;peaking, which the Refinements of Art and Study cannot remedy, he &s;hould advi&s;e them to turn their Views to &s;ome other Way of Life, and not unmercifully beat and flog out of them, as is the Practice of but too many, the few Grains of Ge|nius Nature has given them. An ingenuous Mind will &s;ooner be wrought upon by mild Treat|ment, than by Violence and Rigour; which rather &s;eem a Di&s;charge of the Ma&s;ter's Spleen and Pa&s;|&s;ion, than intended for the Scholar's Advantage.
<PB N="192" REF="246">There is a certain He&s;itancy and Ba&s;hfulne&s;s in &s;ome Natures which mu&s;t not be check'd, but pu&s;h'd forward with as much Care and Diligence, as a &s;kilful ARTIST in GARDENING would the Circulation of an EXOTICK PLANT in his GREEN-HOUSE, or a TREE in his ORCHARD that is a ba&s;hful Bearer. SEVERITY &s;hould never be made U&s;e of till all gentler Me|thods have been tried, and found un&s;ucce&s;sful; then indeed it may be practis'd as the ultimate Remedy, but then too with Di&s;cretion, &s;o as to carry nothing of Revenge along with it, &s;o as to be no greater than Nece&s;&s;ity requires, and to con|tinue no longer than till it produces either Amend|ment, or di&s;covers an utter Incapacity for Learn|ing.</P>
<P>I MUST own, the Ma&s;ter is not always to blame for recommending Youth that are a little thick|&s;kull'd, have &s;lender Parts, and &s;low Apprehen|&s;ions, to go into our Profe&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e, I be|lieve, 'tis &s;ometimes the Parents' Fault, their take a particular Liking to it, and therefore de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e their
<PB N="193" REF="247">Sons may be of it. But in &s;o great, &s;o important, and weighty an Affair of Life, Parents ought to con&s;ider the Capacities of their Children, more than their own Inclinations. Yet Ma&s;ters are &s;o far to blame, as when they cannot keep their Tem|per, and bear the Tediou&s;ne&s;s of learning tho&s;e with Patience who have none of the quicke&s;t Parts. They ought to wait the I&s;&s;ue of their Hopes, how|ever long it may be deferr'd. There are many excellent Tempers, &s;ays an ingenious Per&s;on, which are worthy to be nouri&s;hed and cultivated with all po&s;&s;ible Diligence and Care, that were never de&s;ign'd to be acquainted with ARISTOTLE, TULLY, or VIRGIL; and there are as many who have Capacities for under&s;tanding every Word tho&s;e great Per&s;ons have writ; and yet were not born to have any Reli&s;h of their Writings. Such therefore (as I intimated before) &s;hould be &s;ent to &s;ome Mechanick Way of Life, without re&s;pect to their Birth, if Nature de&s;ign'd them for nothing higher, for 'tis no Guilt to be an hone&s;t plain TRADESMAN or MECHANICK. But before they go to what they have the mo&s;t natural Pro|pen&s;ity
<PB N="194" REF="248">to, let them be allur'd to Habits of Virtue, and their Minds train'd to a Sen&s;e of Honour and Religion, whil&s;t they are in the Simplicity of their native Innocence, full of Shame, and capable of any Impre&s;&s;ion from that Grace of Soul; and let not the Sparks of Virtue be extingui&s;h'd in them for Want of Patience, Care, and Culture; the mo&s;t excellent Natures are &s;oon depreciated and &s;poil'd by Negligence and Impatience, and Want of proper Application to exalt them into good Habits.</P>
<P><Q>PLANTS and VEGETABLES are cultivated into the Production of finer Fruit than they would yield without that Care. NATURAL HISTORIANS tell us, that no Fruit grew originally among us, be&s;ides HIPS and HAWS, ACORNS and PIG-NUTS, with other Deli|cacies of the like Nature; that our Climate of it&s;elf, and without Culture, can make no farther Advances towards a PLUMB than to a SLOE, and carries an APPLE to no greater Perfection than a CRAB; that our MELONS, our PEACHES,
<PB N="195" REF="249">our FIGS, our APRICOCKS, and CHERRIES, are Strangers among us, imported in different Ages, and naturaliz'd in our ENGLISH GAR|DENS by Culture; and that they would all de|generate and fall away into the Tra&s;h of our own Country, if they were wholly neglected by the PLANTER, and not cultivated, but left to the Mercy of our SUN and SOIL. Nei|ther, I think, can we hope to model a ten|der con&s;cious Spirit into Acts of Virtue, with|out the &s;ame Method as is u&s;ed to improve the VEGETABLE WORLD, to cut TIMBER, or give new Shape to a Piece of STONE or MARBLE.</Q></P>
<P>OUR modern forward SLIPS of Quality put forth nothing but BLOSSOMS, and continue a kind of overgrown Children all their Lifetime. The Rea&s;on is, YOUNG MASTER is not &s;uffer'd by the FOND MAMMA to be too much plagued with going to SCHOOL, for fear of breaking his Spirits, making him booki&s;h, and &s;o fit for nothing but to make a PARSON.&mdash;How do the&s;e Sparks
<PB N="196" REF="250">behave them&s;elves in the Prime of Life? In RE|LIGION, they are generally FREE-THINKERS (in the wor&s;t Sen&s;e of the Word) from the want of an early pious Education; in POLITICKS, they are Slaves to the Party who&s;e Principles they were brought up in; in MORALS, they are loo&s;e; and above all other Evils, dete&s;t SOLITUDE and MATRIMONY: the fir&s;t, becau&s;e it would make them conver&s;e with them&s;elves; and the latter, be|cau&s;e it might lead them into the Company of a Per&s;on, towards whom they know not how to be|have, <HI>viz.</HI> that of A MODEST WOMAN.</P>
<P>As to a PUBLICK or PRIVATE EDUCATION, 'tis not yet determined, I think, which is mo&s;t eli|gible; &s;ometimes the one, and &s;ometimes the other is preferr'd, according to the Fancy of People of fine Ta&s;te. As in ancient PERSIA the Youth of Quality was put to a polite MEDE for Education, &s;o the Child of Di&s;tinction about ********* is happy in having his ************** for his publick or private Tutor. As young Ma&s;ter is only de&s;ign'd for a fine Gentleman, it
<PB N="197" REF="251">would give an unhappy Bia&s;s to his Infant-Mind, to make a good found PROTESTANT, an orthodox CHRISTIAN, or a loyal SUBJECT of him; the Child, to be &s;ure, is too young to imbibe the Prin|ciples of Di&s;obedience to his GOD, or his PRINCE, from the Policies and Maxims of a ******** Teacher; there is no Need to make LOYALTY of either Kind habitual to it, or to take Care that DISLOYALTY do not become &s;o in its Stead.</P>
<P>BUT if you were to demand my Opinion con|cerning a publick or private Education, which ought to have the Preference, I &s;hould tell you, that the Youth who is like a weak BARK, which in boi&s;terous SEAS and WINDS carries too much SALL, and too little Balla&s;t, who&s;e JUDGMENT is weak and un&s;teady, and who&s;e PASSIONS are light and violent as HURRICANES, ought un|que&s;tionably to have a private Education; but &s;e|dater Tempers a publick one. It ought no more to derogate from the Excellency of the latter, be|cau&s;e of the Mi&s;carriages of &s;ome unhappy Na|tures, than &s;ome few SHIPWRECKS ought to
<PB N="198" REF="252">di&s;credit NAVIGATION, or the failing of &s;ome few TRADERS di&s;parage ART and INDUS|TRY; 'tis enough that the experienced and &s;kilful, the careful and diligent, do generally &s;ail &s;ucce&s;s|fully. What valuable Trea&s;ures have been deriv'd to Po&s;terity from tho&s;e famous Schools of PY|THAGORAS, SOCRATES, ZENO, PLATO, ARISTOTLE, in&s;tituted at ATHENS; and tho&s;e of POLYBIUS, CARNEADES, DIOGE|NES, CRITOLAUS, and others, &s;et up at ROME; by who&s;e noble Precepts and In&s;tructions were formed the learned and eminent Heroes of Anti|quity, that have done Honour to Human Nature, and left &s;uch Tracts of Glory behind them, as di&s;tingui&s;h the Years in which they acted their Parts from the ordinary Cour&s;e of Time?</P>
<P>BUT to re&s;ume. As there is a Manner of &s;peaking in which nothing &s;hocks an Audience, nothing can di&s;gu&s;t, nothing can di&s;plea&s;e it; a Manner in which there is nothing that is uncouth, har&s;h, or untunable, nothing that is aukward, ru&s;|tick, or &s;lovenly, nothing that is drow&s;y, dry,
<PB N="199" REF="253">and &s;piritle&s;s; we mu&s;t follow that, and endeavour to &s;peak quickly, &s;moothly, and gently. For an Audience of all Things cannot endure to hear a SERMON drawlingly preached, or the Divine Ser|vice negligently &s;lubber'd over, read in a lifele&s;s, cool, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Manner, or yet &s;poke with puf|fing and &s;welling. Such is the Effect of a feeling Manner of &s;peaking, that it becomes, as it were, the PICTURE of our own Minds, and conciliates the E&s;teem and Attention of our Hearers. The COMMON PRAYER e&s;pecially makes a deeper Impre&s;&s;ion upon them, when they perceive in us a proper Fervour and Emotion of Soul. For as no MATTER is &s;o combu&s;tible as to kindle with|out the Application of Fire; &s;o no one's Mind is &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of the Power of DEVOTION, as to catch its Blaze, unle&s;s we, when we read Pray|ers, appear to be &s;o affected, as to be all of a Flame our&s;elves. In &s;hort, a becoming PATHOS and Energy of Diction animates an Audience with uncommon Life and Spirit, and gives mere Words the Force, as it were, of In&s;piration.</P>
<Q><PB N="200" REF="254"><P>How pathetick and beautiful is URANIUS'S Manner of reading the COMMON PRAYER! HE reads the whole Service &s;o di&s;tinctly, &s;o emphatically, &s;o fervently, that 'tis next to an Impo&s;&s;ibility to be unattentive. Peoples' Eyes and Thoughts cannot wander as they u&s;ually do when &s;ome others read, but are con|fin'd to their Prayers; their Minds are really affected, and fervent Wi&s;hes accompany their Words. For HE reads the CONFESSION with &s;uch a re&s;ign'd Humility, the ABSOLU|TION with &s;uch a comfortable AUTHORITY, the THANKSGIVINGS with &s;uch a religious JOY, as makes his HEARERS feel tho&s;e Af|fectons of the Mind that HE him&s;elf does, they &s;eem tran&s;ported in their Addre&s;&s;es to the ALMIGHTY, and, as it were, in HEAVEN.</P>
<P>I would propo&s;e this Clergyman as a Pattern to all tho&s;e of our Profe&s;&s;ion, who murder the DIVINE Service by their Manner of reading it. The EXAMPLE of &s;uch an excellent Reader would make tho&s;e that are afraid of
<PB N="201" REF="255">&s;tretching their Mouths, and &s;poiling their Lungs, learn to read with Clearne&s;s, Loudne&s;s, and Strength; and others that affect a raki&s;h negligent Air, by folding their Arms, and lol|ling on their Book, would be taught by HIM a decent Behaviour, and a comely Erection of Body: Tho&s;e that read &s;o fa&s;t, as if im|patient of their Work, may learn by HIM to &s;peak deliberately. There are another Sort of Per&s;ons whom we may call PINDARICK READERS, as being confin'd to no &s;et Mea|&s;ure; the&s;e pronounce five or &s;ix Words with great Deliberation, and the five of &s;ix &s;ub&s;equent ones with as great Celerity: The fir&s;t Part of a Sentence with a loud exalted Voice, and the latter Part with a low &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive one: Some|times again with one &s;ort of Tone, and imme|diately after with a very different one. The&s;e Gentlemen might learn of my admir'd READ|ER URANIUS, an Evenne&s;s of Voice and Delivery; and all who are innocent of the&s;e Af|fectations, but read with &s;uch an Indifferency, as if they did not under&s;tand the Language, or
<PB N="202" REF="256">were reading a BALLAD or NEWS PAPER, may be inform'd by HIS EXAMPLE of the Art of reading Prayers movingly and fervently, how to place the Empha&s;is, and give the pro|per Accent to each Word, and how to vary the Voice according to the Nature of the Sentence.</P>
<P>How great an Influence would the Service of our Church have on the People, containing the be&s;t Prayers that ever were compos'd, and that in Terms mo&s;t affecting, mo&s;t humble, and mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of our Wants, and Depen|dance on the Subject of our Wor&s;hip, di&s;pos'd in a mo&s;t proper Order; and void of all Con|fu&s;ion; what Influence, I &s;ay, would the&s;e Prayers have, were their exalted Sen&s;e not de|preciated by the di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Indolence of the Readers here complain'd of, but deliver'd in the Manner that URANIUS does, with a due Empha&s;is, and appo&s;ite ri&s;ing and Variation of Voice, the Sentence concluded with a gentle Ca|dence, and, in a Word, with &s;uch an Accent and Turn of Speech as is peculiar to Prayer.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="203" REF="257">WE of this Profe&s;&s;ion, my Friend, ought to keep clear of the INDECENCIES of AFFEC|TATION in Preaching. For Affectation fills the Mouths of Men with Bomba&s;t and Fu&s;tian, and gives them &s;uch Sentiments as proceed rather from a lofty Swelling and Tumor, than a true Greatne&s;s of Mind, and &s;uch an ungraceful Action, Dre&s;s, and Delivery, as makes them perfectly ridiculous. GERYO has furni&s;hed him&s;elf with a well comb'd Toupee, and an immutable Countenance, has got a Jauntee Air, oppo&s;es his Front to the Ladies, &s;tares &s;edately between every Sentence, nor will he give over this his &s;urprizing Rhetorick, till he has &s;tar'd every one of his fair Audience out of Countenance.</P>
<P>DIABLINTES has got it into his Head that the WHITE GLOVE is a great Help to a po|lite Preacher, if u&s;ed with Skill and Judgment. The di&s;playing a fine Glove as white as Lilly, when the Hand waves gently along with a &s;oft &s;mooth Period, adds an irre&s;i&s;table Force, &s;ays, DIABLINTES, to whatever you deliver, gives
<PB N="204" REF="258">it the Stamp of Sublime, and makes it appear with an inimitable Grace and Elegance. In&s;tead of pu&s;hing your Adver&s;ary Home in a Contro|ver&s;ial Sermon, continues he, with MODE and FIGURE, MAJOR and MINOR, there is no more nece&s;&s;ary, but to make an Exten&s;ion of that Hand on which you wear your Preaching Glove, and you'll infallibly be adjudged Victor, by your Auditors.</P>
<P>SANDROCOTUS holds the thumping the CUSHION as a powerful Auxiliary in the Pulpit. The thumping it every now and then, may &s;up|ply a Pau&s;e, &s;ays he, expre&s;s JOY, ANGER, or &s;everal other Pa&s;&s;ions, according to the Action or Manner you u&s;e in thumping it. A late celebra|ted Preacher, adds he, who generally had the good Fortune to plea&s;e, on any Emergency in the Pulpit had immediate Recour&s;e to the EXPRES|SIVE THUMP, and &s;eldom without Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>CYZICENUS thinks he charms both the great and &s;mall Vulgar with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a beauti|ful
<PB N="205" REF="259">WHITE HANDKERCHIEF. Whenever he is like to be at a Lo&s;s, he never makes a HUM or HA, but whips from under his Gown his DE|CLAMATORY HANDKERCHIEF in &s;o pretty, genteel, and elegant a Manner, that it immedi|ately cau&s;es a Redundancy of Wit, he tells you, Fluency of Words, Propriety of Expre&s;&s;ion, and Impetuo&s;ity of Diction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall now &s;hew you, by way of POSTCRIPT, what is requir'd to make a CLERGYMAN an ORTHODOX TEACHER,&mdash; "right|ly dividing the WORD of TRUTH." &mdash; Now to do this, he mu&s;t be lawfully called to the MI|NISTRY. He cannot divide the WORD rightly if he have a wrong Title to do it, if he do it upon his own Head, or upon in&s;ufficient Authority. Now, I think, 'tis &s;ufficiently prov'd, even to the &s;ilencing GAINSAYER, that the only ordinary
<PB N="216" REF="269">lawful Call into the Mini&s;try is by EPISCOPAL ORDINATION. For we find no Ordination in Scripture but what was made by the APOSTLES, and whom they had before ordain'd Bi&s;hops, as is clear by the Example of PAUL, BARNABAS, and TITUS; and never any Ordination by PRESBYTERS was ever &s;o much as dreamt of till of late Years, and that was only to &s;erve a Turn at GENEVA. Therefore all that come rightly into the Clergy, mu&s;t come this Way. 'Tis not the being of a pert confident Humour, or a popular noi&s;y Eloquence, that gives a Man a Commi&s;&s;ion to divide the WORD of TRUTH, but this lawful Means which CHRIST has in&s;ti|tuted; this is the only DOOR which our BLES|SED LORD has made to come into the CHURCH, and then he has made the Con&s;equence, that they who come in otherwi&s;e are THIEVES and ROB|BERS. Without a lawful ORDINATION a Man has no more Title to the PRIESTHOOD than he has to the CROWN, and the Crime of each Pre|&s;umption is equally great, only the Laws are more fevere again&s;t the one than the other. But when
<PB N="217" REF="270">GOD took the Execution into his Hands, the Ca&s;e was otherwi&s;e; for when KORAH, DATHAN, and ABIRAM, u&s;urp'd the Prie&s;thood, they found as dreadful a Puni&s;hment as ever any Trai|tor &s;ince.</P>
<P>LIVY in his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>LIVY</HI>'s Hi&s;t. Vol. <HI>2.</HI> L. <HI>9.</HI></NOTE> Hi&s;tory tells us, that the Fa|mily of the POTITII, who had the Privilege of performing the Prie&s;tly Office at the Altar of HERCULES, called the ARA MAXIMA, ha|ving by the Advice of APPIUS the Cen&s;or, in|&s;tructed &s;ome publick Servants in the &s;olemn Rites of their Function with a De&s;ign to commit the Ex|erci&s;e of their Office to them as their Delegates, an amazing Effect en&s;ued, and one, &s;ays the Hi|&s;torian, that may ju&s;tly deter from making any Alteration in Religion, for tho' there were at that Time twelve Families of the POTITII, and thirty Per&s;ons above the Age of fourteen Years, they all dy'd within the Space of one Year thereafter, and the whole Race became extinct. Nor is it only
<PB N="218" REF="271">ob&s;erv'd, continues he, that the Name of the POTITII peri&s;h'd upon this Occa&s;ion, but al&s;o that APPIUS the Cen&s;or, &s;ome Years after, by the la&s;ting Re&s;entment of HEAVEN, entirely lo&s;t the Sight of his Eyes.</P>
<P>HE mu&s;t be no SCHISMATICK. If a Man comes into the Church ever &s;o regularly, yet if he &s;chi&s;matically makes a Separation from it, he is no orthodox Teacher, he does not righty divide the Word of Truth, becau&s;e he takes wrong Mea&s;ures to do it; he has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o Commi&s;&s;ion to be a Teacher out of the Church, his Orders do not qualify him to &s;et up Altar again&s;t Altar, but he acts as hei|nou&s;ly as if he preach'd the Go&s;pel without any Orders at all. Our BLESSED SAVIOUR in the whole Tenour of his Doctrine preaches up Peace and Unity; in his dying Speech to his Di&s;ciples, he &s;ays, <Q>Peace I leave with you, my Peace I give unto you.</Q> The APOSTLE does, with all the pathetical Endearments imaginable, engage us to UNITY, <Q>If there be any CONSOLATION in CHRIST, &s;ays he, if there be any COMFORT
<PB N="219" REF="272">in LOVE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> fulfill ye my Joy, that ye be all like-minded.</Q></P>
<P>NOBLE was that ANSWER of a certain PRE|LATE, and worthy of a Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hop, to a PRIME MINISTER'S Letter, containing a Re|proof for holding &s;ome orthodox Opinions which the Mini&s;ter did not like.&mdash;A BISHOP, who&s;e <Q>Con&s;cience cannot reproach him, who likes the Place of his Re&s;idence, and has no Ambition to live within the Sun-&s;hine of a Court, need fear nothing of what your LORDSHIP can write to him. As a NOBLEMAN, I pay you Re&s;pect; as a MINISTER of State, I have nothing to do with you; as a CHRISTIAN, I am ac|countable to GOD alone. 'Tis before his TRI|BUNAL I hope to render my&s;elf acceptable, where we mu&s;t both of us appear &s;hortly: And it behoves you, my LORD, to take heed, le&s;t you &s;hould not find there the &s;ame Favour as in the COURTS of MEN.</Q></P>
<P>HE mu&s;t not be an HERETICK, one that
<PB N="220" REF="273">holds an erroneous FAITH concerning the funda|mental Parts of Religion, concerning the DIVI|NITY, the INCARNATION, SATISFACTION of our LORD; concerning the DEITY of the HOLY GHOST, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of his GRACE; &s;uch an one is &s;o far from being a right Divider of the Truth, that he teaches a fal&s;e Religion, and another Go&s;pel; &s;uch an one ought not to con|tinue a Member of CHRIST'S Flock, much le&s;s a Teacher and Pa&s;tor of it.</P>
<P>HE mu&s;t not be an ob&s;tinate Defender of any fal&s;e or erroneous Doctrine of le&s;&s;er Moment. For let the Doctrine be of ever &s;o &s;mall Moment, 'tis &s;till an Oppo&s;ition again&s;t the Truth, 'tis a con|fronting of GOD's WORD, and an innovating in the Doctrine of the CATHOLICK CHURCH. Be&s;ides, 'tis very dangerous to have a Teacher of &s;uch erroneous Opinions; becau&s;e 'tis very natural for the People to imbibe them from him, and they may be tempted in Time, for the E&s;teem they have for their Pa&s;tor, to make a formal Schi&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="274">FOR a MINISTER to be an ORTHODOX TEACHER, he mu&s;t not teach uncertain Truths. The APOSTLE bids us exhort with &s;ound Doc|trine, not to build with HAY and STUBBLE; and he him&s;elf came with DEMONSTRATION, as well as POWER; and the other Apo&s;tles taught what they had heard and &s;een; which ought to be well con&s;ider'd by tho&s;e Divines, who value them|&s;elves upon their new-fangled NOSTRUMS in DIVINITY, and fine-&s;pun Inventions in this Science. For Divinity is a Thing which is recom|mended mo&s;t by Antiquity. Our FAITH was but once delivered to the SAINTS, and &s;o leaves no Room for the Wits of later Ages. But if Men mu&s;t be &s;hewing their Parts, and giving the World a Ca&s;t of their rare Inventions, they have a large Scope for it el&s;ewhere, but, by all Means, they ought to &s;pare DIVINITY.</P>
<P>HE ought to ground his Doctrine upon SCRIP|TURE, and the EXPLICATION of the CA|THOLICK CHURCH. TO teach Doctrines with|out the Confirmation of Scripture, is to teach the
<PB N="222" REF="275">Doctrines of Men; and to explain Scripture other|wi&s;e than the Church of GOD has done in all Ages, is always Pre&s;umption, and frequently Here&s;y, All Doctrines, and Explications of Faith e&s;pe|cially, were &s;uperabundantly &s;ifted by ancient Councils and Writers, when they were Matter of Debate for &s;o many Ages; and therefore we ought to &s;tick to their Notions and Expre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e facred Truths, who are &s;uppos'd to under&s;tand them better than any &s;ingle modern Divine, who has only convers'd with his own Thoughts. Now to remedy this, we ought to &s;tudy DIVI|NITY fir&s;t out of the HOLY SCRIPTURE, and next out of the FATHERS, who, let &s;ome Men &s;ay what they will, were Men of very good Sen&s;e, and talk very intelligibly: and tho' the SOCI|NIANS and REMONSTRANTS may have more of Method, Clo&s;ene&s;s, and Subtilty, they have that which makes Alloy for all this, a great deal more of HERESY.</P>
<P>AND now, (my Friend!) I can perceive 'tis Time to put an End to <HI>this</HI> Epi&s;tolary Corre&s;pon|dence.
<PB N="223" REF="276">I have taken the Liberty, you &s;ee, to laugh upon &s;ome Occa&s;ions; and if I have either laugh'd wrong, or been impertinently &s;erious, I can be content to be laugh'd at in my Turn; for my Humour does not very much incline me to melan|cholly Reflections. I have very freely, and with|out the lea&s;t Re&s;erve, given you my Sentiments concerning the nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications of a Mini|&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, as he is a CHRISTIAN, a PASTOR, and a CATHOLICK; and I pray GOD, if you go into HOLY ORDERS, you may do your Duty in all the&s;e Re&s;pects. But a Good Life ought to be the Principal of your Aim, for a wicked Life is the wor&s;t of HERESIES, and a Mini&s;ter may do more Mi&s;chief to Religion by one ill Action, than Good by a Hundred fine Sermons. Nay, we undo all we preach by an ill Practice, for Men have Rea&s;on to think that That Doctrine &s;hould not have any Influence upon their Lives, which they &s;ee has none upon our own. To me, indeed, it &s;eems &s;urprizing, that an im|moral Clergyman can have the Con&s;idence to ap|pear or preach in Publick; for all his Declamati|ons
<PB N="224" REF="277">again&s;t Vice, are but &s;o many Libels again&s;t him&s;elf, and every Time he gets up into the Pul|pit, he is but doing a PUBLICK PENANCE to the whole Congregation. Let me intreat you therefore &s;teadily to adhere to the Practice of Vir|tue; dare to oppo&s;e your&s;elf to the licentious Cu&s;toms of a degenerate Age, wherever you go; and by a good Example, endeavour to &s;tem the Torrent of Vice. Don't blu&s;h to own your Obli|gations daily and hourly to that great Being, who fills the Univer&s;e with the wondrous Exertions of his Wi&s;dom and Power; give him your highe&s;t E&s;teem, your highe&s;t Reverence, and &s;upreme Regard. Let your Devotion to him &s;pring from Love and Gratitude, and never mention his Name without a re&s;pectful and humble Awe; regard his Favour as the highe&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing; and endeavour to imitate and follow the bright Example, which the BLESSED AUTHOR of our Religion has &s;et before us. Believe me, my DEAR FRIEND; there is no Compari&s;on between a wicked and a good Life: A good Life, &s;tor'd with every moral and religious
<PB N="225" REF="278">Virtue, re&s;embles HEAVEN, methinks, its CAN|NOPY &s;tuck with STARS and CONSTELLATI|ONS.

<P>'TIS the Part of a Man to melt in &s;uch Ca&s;es, of a Brute not to be mov'd at all, of a Chri&s;tian to be moderate in his Regret. Methinks, SIR, the Experience you have had of the World, and hu|man Chances, &s;hould &s;teel you enough again&s;t the like Strokes. How many Funeral-Matches had your Eyes &s;een, ere Death knock'd at your Friend's Door? But he might (you will &s;ay) have liv'd longer. True! &s;o he might have dy'd &s;ooner. What Rea&s;on have we to think that too ha&s;tily taken away, which was payable as &s;oon as we receiv'd it? If his Mortality di&s;pleas'd you, you &s;hould have mourn'd when it began, not when it ends. Why do we grieve for a Wound which no Grief can relieve or remedy? Why bear we not that in another which we mu&s;t come to our&s;elves? 'Tis for none but our MAKER to be eternal. Lie we not all under an unchangeable
<PB N="240" REF="290">Law, under an eternal Ordinance, to be <HI>born</HI> and <HI>die?</HI></P>
<P>THE SNOW and ICE of WINTER may lie crowded together a While, and hold out for a Month or two, but the SPRING will be &s;ure to melt it all: Should we chance to pa&s;s over our Youth and Virility &s;afe, yet OLD AGE will con|&s;ume us at la&s;t.</P>
<P>WE come into this World as CHILDREN are &s;ent to SCHOOL, not to live there alway, but to learn &s;omewhat, and then be gone. We &s;cramble up from lower to higher Forms, from our Childhood to an Age of Con&s;tancy and Gra|vity; but we mu&s;t be gone when we have learn'd enough to fit and prepare us for Heaven; and the &s;ooner we grow fit, the &s;ooner we are taken away. Virtue protects not the Body, but glorifies the Soul. As Flowers of the faire&s;t Hue, and Gla&s;&s;es of the fine&s;t Mould, wither and break &s;oon|e&s;t: So we commonly &s;ee them that excell in Virtue to be &s;horte&s;t liv'd, when the ungodly and di&s;&s;olute

When the MOWER or REAPER cometh, Weeds and Flowers, Corn and Cockle, high and low Spires, ripe and unripe Ears, are cut down alike: So deals the SICKLE of DEATH with us, of what Age, of what Rank &s;oever, it makes bold to pare us away. The GREAT LORDS of the Earth, after all their painted Glory, and &s;tern ruffling, are brought down to the Gha&s;tline&s;s and Du&s;t of Death: Nay, mighty States and Kingdoms expire, tho&s;e awful Monarchies that &s;pread &s;o far, are &s;hrunk to nothing: Heaven and Earth look for a Day of Di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>WHEN all are rated for POLL-MONEY, what Pride, what Partiality, nay, what Folly were it to grumble, and &s;eek Exemption? Death is a Tri|bute which all pay; why then &s;hould we grieve and whine when we are called upon for it? Why &s;hould we think to &s;lip the COLLAR alone? The only Salve for a Nece&s;&s;ity is a willing Compliance with it. What &s;hould we do but give up a

<P>AND as it avails not to quarrel with a Law of Nece&s;&s;ity, &s;o it becomes us not to to quarrel with the Will of GOD. <Q>We mu&s;t, &s;ays a RABBIN, be as bold as LEOPARDS, as &s;wift as EAGLES, as nimble as HARTS, and as valiant as LYONS, to do the Will of our Father which is in Hea|ven.</Q> And is it not HE that kills and maketh alive, that brings us down to the Grave, and that rai&s;es us up? Shall Sun, and Moon, and Stars, and Elements &s;ubmit to that high CREATOR, and &s;hall Man alone, who owes him mo&s;t Service, &s;purn at his Decrees? As that CENTURION in Sacred Writ could &s;ay of his Dome&s;ticks, <Q>If he call'd a Servant, he came pre&s;ently, if he &s;ent him forth, he went;</Q> &s;o &s;hould we behave our|&s;elves to our heavenly Ma&s;ter.

What fearful Judgments were pronounced on ELI and all his Hou&s;e, yet
<PB N="243" REF="293">he puts them up with this mild Acknowledgment, <Q>It is the LORD, let him do what &s;eemeth him good; what &s;hould a Servant do but fulfill his Lord's Plea&s;ure?</Q> Nay, 'tis not only a Lord, but a FATHER that determineth of us. Even Children are many Times handled more &s;everely of their loving Parents than they would be; 'tis for their Good, tho' they di&s;cern it not. The Cour&s;e which our heavenly Father takes with us is no le&s;s beneficial, however it may <HI>gripe</HI> and &s;tartle our &s;en&s;ual Part. Had a STONE or a STAFF hit us, we would look angrily about, and prepare to revenge our&s;elves on the A&s;&s;aulter; but &s;hould we find the Blow given us by a Friend, or by a great Man we depended upon, and that it was rather given in Love and Familiarity, than Spleen or Grudge, we would be calm immediately, and excu&s;e our Choler, and count it a Courte&s;y, not a Wrong: So when temporal Cro&s;&s;es annoy us, the Death of our dear A&s;&s;ociates, the Lo&s;s of our Goods, the Blemi&s;hes of our good Name, in all this would we call to Mind that 'tis but a Friend's Blow, but the fatherly Stroke of a merciful GOD,

<P>THE Savage INDIANS that were demanded by our late Di&s;coverers what they mean't in wor|&s;hipping the SUN, had this Rea&s;on at Hand,&mdash; "Becau&s;e it brought DEATH upon them." They thought it a Device and Ordinance that could &s;uit with none but the Power and Goodne&s;s of a Deity.</P>
<P>YOU, Sir, are depriv'd of one that was de&s;er|vedly dear to you, but let GOD be dearer, who&s;e high Plea&s;ure it was to take him from this World to him&s;elf. What hath HE taken but what HE once gave you? Why &s;hould HE not receive for ever what HE lent you but for a Time? Ah, how fond are we of our own Vexation! Like <HI>ulcerous</HI> Limbs, how do we &s;hrink at every Touch! Many Comforts cannot erect us &s;o much as one
<PB N="245" REF="295">Grief is able to ca&s;t us down. We are greedy of that which we want, and as unthankful for that which we have. Something is gone we once had, and we afflict our&s;elves for it when there were more Rea&s;on it &s;hould quiet than heighten our Grief that we once had it. For that we had it was a Benefit for which we are owing to GOD, and it would be&s;t become us to think of paying our Debt to our bountiful LORD. Lo! he a&s;keth nothing but our PATIENCE, but our PEACE; Peace with our|&s;elves, and Peace with HIM. There is more left us than we have lo&s;t, and why will we lo&s;e what|&s;oever we have, becau&s;e we have not a Thing that we have lo&s;t? For that which we have left is wil|fully lo&s;t while we take no Joy in it. What In|jury do we to our own Happine&s;s if we place it in Things which we want? Never &s;hall we want Matter of Dejection if we go to Work thus. Every MISER'S Coffer, and every MERCHANT'S Ship, every full Table, and every well-furni&s;h'd Hou&s;e we come &s;hort of, will bring us in a plen|tiful Harve&s;t of Perplexity.

<PB N="246" REF="296">hath done for you, to bethink your&s;elf how many Comforts are left you to &s;ea&s;on this particular Lo&s;s. How can you think him dead who in the bright Echo of his Reputation is &s;till remaining with you. LAELIUS could cheer him&s;elf that his SCIPIO was to him alive &s;till,&mdash;alive in his glo|rious Virtues, alive in his renowned Name! 'Twas not the INNOCENT'S Death DAVID bemoan'd, but the REBEL'S. When SOCRATES &s;aw his WIFE &s;torming that &s;uch a <HI>good</HI> Man &s;hould die unju&s;tly, what, &s;ays he, Would'&s;t thou rather have me die a Malefactor?</P>

How unthankful is he, who &s;o remembereth the Lo&s;s of a Benefit, that he forgets the Receit. Shall we receive Good at
<PB N="247" REF="297">GOD'S Hand, and not Evil too? Were it not far better we &s;hould &s;ubmit our&s;elves to the Will of GOD, than the Will of GOD &s;hould be &s;quar'd to ours? Do we fondly pre&s;ume that we know what is better for us, or wi&s;h our&s;elves better than GOD doth? How oft have we delighted in hurtful and perilous Things? How oft have our vain Long|ings brought Mi&s;chief upon us? On the other Side, what gracious Tokens of his Good-will hath GOD &s;hewn us? When HE took our Fle&s;h and liv'd among us, and died for us, was not his Good-will towards Men proclaim'd aloud? And is not his Will the &s;ame in laying the Cro&s;s on us, as in bearing it for us? Had HE not the &s;ame tender Love and gracious Aim in both of doing us good? If we reckon it for our Good that GOD would &s;uffer &s;o much for us, we may believe it for our Good too, that HE would have our&s;elves &s;uffer a little. All HIS Attributes are va&s;t and infinite, HIS Power, Wi&s;dom, and Love; nor is He thus alone in HIMSELF, but this to us; HE loves us better than we love our&s;elves, &mdash; infinitely better! And HE &s;eeks our Good more, and is more able
<PB N="248" REF="298">and &s;kilful to effect it,&mdash;infinitely more! What therefore comes in our Heads when we bemoan our Mi&s;haps? Do we think GOD deceiv'd, or &s;piteful? Do we think HIS Arm &s;horten'd that HE cannot prevent an Evil? Far be &s;uch Thoughts from a Chri&s;tian's Heart. It comes not from any Weakne&s;s, Malice, or Imprudence in HIM that we are vex'd thus, but from HIS infinite Power, Wi&s;dom, and Goodne&s;s; and who are we that, like the old GIANTS, we &s;hould fight with Heaven, and attempt to pull GOD from his Throne, and wring his Sceptre out of his Hand?&mdash; Oh, let us give HIM Leave who made us for his Glory, to rule us at his Will! To that Glory HE will a&s;&s;uredly bring us, if we be guided by his Will and Coun&s;el in the Way to it. A Pa&s;&s;enger at SEA takes not upon him to &s;teer and order the SHIP that wafts him, but leaves that to the Pilot and Ma&s;ter, and in a Storm obeys his Direction mo&s;t, and &s;tirs not a Foot again&s;t his Will, but ca&s;ts out the deare&s;t Things that he has at his Bid|ding. What think you, (my Friend!) hath GOD le&s;s Skill to govern the WORLD, than the SHIP|MAN
<PB N="249" REF="299">his Bark? That which we would do for a Man who is to land us on Earth, &s;hall we not do for a GOD who would bring us to Heaven? Our Cro&s;&s;es are &s;ent us either by an angry GOD or a favouring one; if they are &s;ent in Favour, why do we &s;purn at a Benefit? If in Di&s;plea&s;ure, what &s;hould we do but appea&s;e it with an humble Sub|mi&s;&s;ion? GOD'S Anger will be the &s;ooner ap|peas'd, if we can meet his cha&s;t'ning Hand not only with Silence and Sufferance, but even with Con&s;ent, and Joy, and Thank&s;giving. The old GERMANS well under&s;tood this, who taught their Children, when their Fingers were cut or &s;corch'd, to cry, "GOD be thanked." What heard we from our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed LORD in the Garden of GETH|SEMANI? "Not my Will, O Father, but thine "be done!" And &s;hould not this affect us as much as the rueful Spectacle did that HEBREW Ho&s;t, which were be&s;ieging the MOABITES? They no &s;ooner &s;aw the King's Son offer'd up for a Sa|crifice, but they departed, amaz'd and vex'd. When the Son of GOD him&s;elf becometh a Burnt|offering, and &s;acrificeth his Will to the Will of
<PB N="250" REF="300">his Father, &s;hall it not work as fierce an Indigna|tion within us again&s;t our own Stubbornne&s;s? We &s;olace our&s;elves in all our Extremities to &s;ee other Men &s;uffering with us; and &s;hould we not think it a more abundant Comfort to &s;ee our ble&s;&s;ed LORD a Sharer with us in Sorrow and Sufferance? Shall we leave HIM to climb up to his CROSS alone, and &s;hall we &s;uffer nothing at all with him, but run away from the very Shadow of a threaten|ing Affliction, of a &s;eeming Di&s;tre&s;s?</P>
<P>WHY, SIR, &s;hould we grieve immoderately to &s;ee our Friends going from hence, who have the ANGELS to convey their Souls, and to gather up their Bodies at the la&s;t Day; nay, CHRIST him&s;elf bearing them Company in all their Way? Why went he down to the Grave with us, but to &s;ave us from the Danger and Horror of it? If 'tis an unplea&s;ant Thing to follow the SON of GOD, yet in any ca&s;e let us not fly from him. If we dare not imitate, how dare we re&s;i&s;t him? When we might be like him, why do we thus abhor his Re&s;emblance? Oh, wretched Ingratitude! GOD
<PB N="251" REF="301">&s;tampeth upon us the Image of his beloved Son; and we that will not be like CHRIST in Sufference, become like LUCIFER in Pride; nay, methinks, we become wor&s;e, for LUCIFER thought not him&s;elf better than his GOD. And we, as if we were faultle&s;s, refu&s;e the Stripes which our innocent JESUS bore.</P>
<P>HOWEVER we find our&s;elves &s;tated, indeed, it becomes us to bear our Cro&s;&s;es contentedly. For if we &s;ee a deep Stain of Guilt within us, wer't not an high In&s;olence to be loth to &s;uffer ju&s;tly when CHRIST had tho&s;e bitter Storms of Sorrow upon him who never did ami&s;s? On the other Side, if we find no Indictments in our own Hearts, nothing to implead or accu&s;e us, we are the more encouraged to be like him, who was crucify'd, without a Cau&s;e. If our own Guilt brought not our Affliction upon us, let not Impatience bring any Guilt on our Affliction?</P>
<P>SHOULD we have met our SAVIOUR, as that CIRENIAN did, fainting under his CROSS, and
<PB N="252" REF="302">de&s;iring us to carry it a while for him, nay, &s;hould he have laid that precious Burthen upon our Shoulders with his own Hands, would we churli&s;hly have put it from us, would we have pleaded Excu&s;e or Impatience, would we not have carried it away in Joy and Triumph, and have thought our&s;elves happy to have been cru|cify'd on the &s;ame Tree with the SON of GOD? Lo! this very Honour we may come to, without going to Mount CALVARY for it. GOD puts our Strength to a Trial, with his own Hand im|po&s;eth this or that particular Cro&s;s on us, a Cro&s;s far lighter than that our LORD bore; why do we refu&s;e and abhor it?</P>
<P>THE SON of GOD was wounded and pierced for me by the bloody Hands of ungodly Ruffians; why &s;hould not I &s;uffer a gracious GOD to touch me, why &s;hould I not be &s;truck by &s;o good and gentle a Hand?</P>
<P>WHEN the Di&s;ciples were to&s;&s;ed at SEA, and felt a new Tempe&s;t within them&s;elves, to &s;ee a

<P>'TIS true, SIR, you have lo&s;t an excellent Friend. &mdash; But what, is the Almighty Hand of your heavenly Father any whit &s;horten'd?

You never &s;aw the Righteous for&s;aken; of Men oft enough, but never, never of GOD.</P>
<P>BUT you are not, I hope, &s;o fix'd on the Me|ditation of your own Lo&s;s, but you remember al&s;o, that to him, to die, was Gain. Yes, it was inexpre&s;&s;ible Felicity to be taken away from a

That very Period of Life which we long for, which we are &s;o glad to arrive at, our OLD AGE, what is it el&s;e but a loath&s;ome Pri&s;on?

<P><PB N="255" REF="305">WISELY therefore did GOD and Nature ap|point that Souls, as yet rude and ignorant, &s;hould be infus'd into our Bodies, and kept &s;en&s;ele&s;s in the clos'd Womb, for fear of loathing &s;o har&s;h a Pri|&s;on; which ORPHEUS thought was nothing el&s;e but a Puni&s;hment laid upon us, like that the old Tyrants u&s;ed when they tied the Dead and Living together; for thus, &s;ays he, the pure and immortal Soul is &s;erv'd, when &s;he is yoked with a rotten, corruptible, and crazy Body.

<P><Q>I WISH, &s;ays Dr LUCAS, in his excellent E&s;&s;ay upon Happine&s;s, that whatever Men talk of a Trea&s;ure in <HI>another</HI> World, they do not now and then think it wi&s;e&s;t to have their Por|tion in <HI>this.</HI> How many are there, who making a Profe&s;&s;ion of living by Faith, and looking for the ble&s;&s;ed Hope and Appearance of CHRIST, do yet live as if all the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Life were to get and enjoy as much of <HI>this</HI> World as they can; who profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves the Di&s;ciples of the Son of GOD, who&s;e Heart
<PB N="263" REF="313">was lowly, his Fortune mean, and his Ap|pearance humble, do yet lay out their Time, their Labour, their Wealth on this one De&s;ign, to make &s;uch a Shew, &s;uch a Figure in the World, as may render them the Gaze, the Envy of the Neighbourhood they live in.&mdash; Such a tender Concern for, &s;uch an eager Pur|&s;uit after temporal Things, cannot flow from, nay, nor con&s;i&s;t with Purity of Heart, and Po|verty of Spirit, the Love of GOD, and a De|&s;ire of Heaven.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT an excellent Thing mu&s;t we think that to be which frees us from &s;uch a degenerate World, which even rectifies the crooked Partialities of For|tune, and makes us as good as tho&s;e that trode upon us? We are not therefore to reckon it as an Injury of Fortune, but as a Degree of Grace and Favour unto us, that our Cour&s;e is fini&s;h'd a little &s;ooner than we were aware of. For 'tis as if a TRAVELLER in a rainy wintry Day &s;hould get &s;afe and well to his Journey's End or his Inn ere
<PB N="264" REF="314">Sun-&s;et, which others cannot attain till the dark Night hath overtaken them.</P>
<P>IN a cold &s;evere WINTER we think long till it be pa&s;s'd over, till the warm SPRING and SUM|MER arrive; and why &s;hould not we be as glad to have the Hard&s;hips of this Life exchang'd for the Joys of a better?</P>
<P>WERE a Man nece&s;&s;arily to cro&s;s a deep and dangerous RIVER, what Madne&s;s were it in him to grieve or complain that he had met with a BRIDGE or a BOAT to waft him over? They are, methinks, as fooli&s;h who quarrel with Death; for what is it el&s;e but a Bridge or Boat to waft us to the oppo&s;ite Shore, o'er a Flood we mu&s;t needs pa&s;s, from a brittle and frail Life to a glo|rious and immortal one.</P>
<P>WE are not to judge of Death by that which it carries us from, but by that which it brings us to. To get a Kingdom or poorer Territory we venture our Lives; and what is a Spot of Earth to the
<PB N="265" REF="315">Kingdom of Heaven? What can we reckon Death but our gainfulle&s;t Hour, that adds &s;o much to our Felicity as it takes from our Life. The &s;ooner we die, the longer we are happy.</P>
<P>SEE you not how the poor KINE, that are turn'd out in Winter, will be clinging to the STABLE or BARN-DOOR where they know there is better Food. The World &s;tarves and pines us, and why run we from Death's Door, where Fulne&s;s of Joy lies ready for us? Why mourn we hopele&s;sly for a mouldering Body, which is in &s;o &s;ure a Hope of a Re&s;urrection?</P>
<P>WE &s;ee that tho&s;e Men, who are any thing &s;kill'd in the Nature and Motion of heavenly Bo|dies, are not amaz'd or troubled at the yearly ECLIPSES of the SUN and MOON, becau&s;e they know all the&s;e ob&s;cur'd Planets will quickly re|cover their Light, and &s;hine out as clearly as ever they did. And we, why &s;hould we &s;hrink or &s;hudder to &s;ee the Eyes of our Friends clos'd up in Darkne&s;s, who know the&s;e &s;ullen Eclip&s;es are to la&s;t but a While, that, after a little Interpo&s;ition
<PB N="266" REF="316">of Du&s;t, the&s;e hid and ob&s;cure Bodies &s;hall &s;hine out as the STARS in Heaven.</P>
<P>WHEN that huge PERSIAN Army we read of in Story was &s;etting forward to invade GREECE, MILTIADES, the ATHENIAN General, cal|ling his thin Troops together, pre&s;ented them with a Cock-&s;ight, imagining that would put Courage into them; and the Device took as he wi&s;h'd, for they (&s;eeing &s;uch an invincible Stoutne&s;s and eager Combat in a Couple of Birds, that they would never yield till both lay dead on the Ground) &s;natch'd up their Weapons, and march'd on de|&s;pi&s;ing Danger and Death. WE CHRISTIANS have not Birds and Bea&s;ts, but rea&s;onable Men to give us an Example of Fortitude in bearing the Lo&s;s of our Friends,&mdash;our Relatives,&mdash;our other &s;elves. We &s;ee DAVID wiping his Eyes when his Child was dead; we &s;ee JOB breathing out the Prai&s;es of GOD when a violent Wind had blown all his Sons and Daughters away; we &s;ee that brave DAME in the Book of MACCABEES hearing the Cries of her murder'd Sons with as much Delight as a mu&s;ical Song. Nay, PAGANISM is able to
<PB N="267" REF="317">&s;hew us a TIBERIUS, a PAULUS, a MARTIUS, a CATO, a GALLIENUS at ROME, a PERICLES, a XENOPHON, an ANAXAGORAS in other Places, &s;o manfully bearing the Death of their dome&s;tick Friends and Children, that they have gone pre&s;ently about their Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;at in the Senate-Hou&s;e, and kept their Garlands upon their Heads, and told the World they knew they were mortal Men they had begotten. And we that know more, &s;hall we bear le&s;s? Will not the&s;e Heathens be eternal Monuments of our Shame if we lie groveling in Sorrow, and rai&s;e not up our dejected Hearts?</P>
<P>THE &s;weet and long Acquaintance you had, Dear Sir, with him who&s;e Lo&s;s you lament, the upright and innocent Cour&s;e of his Life, as it gives you the more Hope of his pre&s;ent Happine&s;s, &s;o it gives you the le&s;s Rea&s;on to bewail his Di&s;&s;olu|tion. His Life was not a mere Calm, but a gentle Breeze; it did not con&s;i&s;t in mere Re&s;t and Quiet, but a delightful Motion. Even in his Retirement he could employ all the Vigour of his Mind u&s;e|fully
<PB N="268" REF="318">and delightfully; nay, that very Solitude which would have been the Pri&s;on and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ani&s;h|ment of the bu&s;y Worldling, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aradi&s;e.
