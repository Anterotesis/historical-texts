<P>THESE home-travels are the fir&s;t part of an account of my own country; and were actually performed in the year mentioned in the title page. The world ju&s;tly loves the reality; therefore, this is mentioned to &s;atisfy the public, that they are not formed out of tours undertaken at different periods.</P>
<P>THESE make of them&s;elves a complete tour of the tamer parts of our country. In a future volume, the wild and romantic &s;cenery will be pre&s;ented, inter|mixed with the rich vallies &s;o frequently inter&s;per&s;ed. To this will be added an Appendix, containing the &s;ub|jects referred to in this volume, with variety of other mat|ter. I implore the aid of my countrymen to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in the attempt; and to favor me with the nece&s;&s;ary mate|rials. They will &s;ee, that great part of <HI>Denbigh&s;hire,</HI> and all parts of the four remaining counties of our principality, are &s;till to be de&s;cribed. My frequent

<P>AMONG the gentlemen I am chiefly indebted to for information re&s;pecting the pre&s;ent work, I cannot pa&s;s unthanked:</P>

<HEAD>THE TOUR IN NORTH WALES, MDCCLXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>I NOW &s;peak of my native country, celebrated in our ear|lie&s;t hi&s;tory for its valour and tenacity of its liberty; for the &s;tand it made again&s;t the <HI>Romans;</HI> for its &s;laughter of the legions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vita Agricolae.</NOTE>; and for the &s;ubjection of the nation by <HI>Agricola,</HI> who did not dare to attempt his <HI>Caledonian</HI> expedition, and leave behind him unconquered &s;o tremendous an enemy.</P>
<P>WHEN our fir&s;t invaders landed in <HI>Great Britain, North Wales</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Ordovices,</HI> a name derived from the language of the country, &s;ignifying the &s;ituation; being almo&s;t entirely bounded by the river <HI>Deva,</HI> or the modern <HI>Dee,</HI> and another river of the name of <HI>Dyvi</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Llwyd</HI> in <HI>Cambden</HI> II. 778.</NOTE>. The one flows into the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> &s;ea below <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> the other into the &s;ame &s;ea on the borders of <HI>Cardi|gan&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;pirit which the people &s;hewed at the beginning, did not de&s;ert them to the la&s;t. Notwith&s;tanding they were obliged
<PB N="2" REF="10">
to &s;ubmit to the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s power of the <HI>Romans,</HI> they never fell a prey to the enervating charms of luxury, as the other nations of this i&s;land did. They never, with womani&s;h invocations, reque&s;ted the aid of the de&s;erting conquerors, or &s;unk beneath the pre&s;&s;ure of the new invaders; they pre&s;erved an undaunted courage amid&s;t their native rocks, and received among them the gallant fugitives, happy in congenial &s;ouls. The hardy <HI>Saxons,</HI> for above three centuries, could not make an impre&s;&s;ion even on our low lands. <HI>Offa</HI> was the fir&s;t; who extended his kingdom for &s;ome miles within our borders. His conque&s;t was but temporary; for we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> the capital of the <HI>Cornavii,</HI> till the year 883, when it was wre&s;ted from us by the united force of the Heptarchy beneath the able <HI>Egbert.</HI> This indeed reduced our confines; but did not &s;ubdue our &s;pirit. With obdurate valour we &s;uftained our independency for another four centuries, again&s;t the power of a kingdom more than twelve times larger than it&s;elf: and at length had the glory of falling, when a divided country, beneath the arms of the mo&s;t wi&s;e, and mo&s;t warlike of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mo|narchs.</P>
<P>I NATURALLY begin my journey from the place of my nativity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FLINTSHIRE.</NOTE> <HI>Downing</HI> in the county of <HI>Flint.</HI> To give a general idea of this &s;hire, the reader mu&s;t learn, that it is le&s;t of the twelve <HI>Welch.</HI> Its northern &s;ide is wa&s;hed by the e&s;tuary of the <HI>Dee,</HI> the <HI>Seteia E&s;tuarium</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy.</HI> The land ri&s;es &s;uddenly from the &s;hore in fine inequalities, clayey, and plenteous in corn and gra&s;s, for two, three or four miles, to a montanous tract that runs parallel to it for a confiderable way.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="11">THE lower part is divided by picture&s;que dingles, which run from the mountains, and open to the &s;ea, filled with oaks. The inferior parts abound with coal and free&s;tone; the upper with minerals of lead and calamine, and immen&s;e &s;trata of lime|&s;tone and chert. The principal trade of the country is mining and &s;melting.</P>
<P>The northern part of the county is flat, and very rich in corn, e&s;pecially wheat, which is generally exported to <HI>Liverpool.</HI> The &s;hire, in mo&s;t places, rai&s;es more than is &s;ufficient for the u&s;e of the inhabitants. It is extremely populous; and in the mine|ral parts compo&s;ed of a mixed people, who&s;e fathers and grand|fathers had re&s;orted here for &s;ake of employ out of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mine counties; many of who&s;e children, born of <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> mothers, have quite lo&s;t the language of their fathers.</P>
<P>A LOFTY range of mountains ri&s;e on the we&s;t, and form a bold frontier. Our county is watered by &s;everal &s;mall rivers; &s;uch as the <HI>Allen,</HI> the <HI>Terrig,</HI> and the <HI>Wheeler;</HI> part of its we&s;tern boundary by the <HI>Clwyd;</HI> and <HI>Maelwr,</HI> a disjoined part of the country, by the DEE.</P>
<P>WE are ignorant of the cla&s;&s;ical name of this little province. The <HI>Ordovices,</HI> of which all we&s;t of <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> was part, were &s;ubdivided in the time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> in all probability, as the re&s;t of the country was. They had <HI>Reguli</HI> or Lords who ruled over little di&s;tricts, and united under a common leader when the exigencies of the time required. The&s;e factions weakened the &s;tate, &s;eparated their intere&s;t, and facilitated their conque&s;t by the fir&s;t invaders.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12">THE names of the&s;e di&s;tricts are now unknown. <HI>Gwynedd</HI> is the mo&s;t antient we are acquainted with for the country of <HI>North Wales.</HI> The portion I inhabit was called <HI>Tegangle,</HI> which com|prehends the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hree modern hundreds of <HI>Cole&s;hill, Pre&s;tatyn,</HI> and <HI>Rudland.</HI> The name is pre&s;erved in the montanous parts of this pari&s;h, and &s;ome others, to this day called <HI>Mynnydd Tegang.</HI> I reject the tran&s;lation of <HI>Tegangle</HI> into <HI>Fair England,</HI> as a mongrel compound. The word is of a much more antient date; it be|ing derived from <HI>Cangi</HI> or <HI>Ceangi,</HI> a &s;et of people, according to the learned <HI>Baxter,</HI> belonging to every <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> nation; who at|tended the herds and re&s;ided with them in different grazing grounds at different times of the year. The neighboring <HI>Cornavii</HI> had their <HI>Ceangi,</HI> who wintered in <HI>Wiral,</HI> and took their &s;ummer re&s;idence in <HI>Tegangle;</HI> a word to be properly derived on that account from <HI>Teg,</HI> fair, <HI>Cang,</HI> the name of the people, and <HI>Lle,</HI> a place. To corroborate which, at this very day is a plain in the pari&s;h of <HI>Caerwys,</HI> a part of the old <HI>Tegangle,</HI> adjoining to this mountain, that &s;till retains the title of <HI>Maes can havod,</HI> or the plain of the hundred &s;ummer re&s;idences. For this rea&s;on I pre&s;ume to differ from Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> in his notion of the &s;um|mer re&s;idence of the&s;e <HI>Cangi.</HI> He places it near the <HI>Canganorum Promontorium,</HI> or <HI>Braich y pwll</HI> head in <HI>Caernarvon&s;hire;</HI> but tho&s;e were the <HI>Cangi</HI> of the <HI>Ordovices,</HI> the&s;e of the <HI>Cornavii.</HI></P>
<P>IT may be remarked, that, contrary to what happens to mo&s;t &s;ubdued nations, our country pre&s;erved its own language: and the conquerors even deigned to adopt the names of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> towns and people, latinizing them from the original words. Thus <HI>Londinium</HI> from LUNDEIN, <HI>i. e.</HI> LLONG DIN or
<PB N="5" REF="13">
DINAS, <HI>the city of &s;hips</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cambden I. 370.</NOTE>, from its con&s;iderable commerce; DEVA from its &s;ituation on the river <HI>Deva</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Or</HI> Dy&s;i.</NOTE>; DUNMONII from <HI>Dun|mnyn,</HI> or <HI>the hill of ore;</HI> BRIGANTES from <HI>Brig,</HI> choice or chief men; <HI>Coritani,</HI> or rather <HI>Coitani,</HI> from <HI>Coed,</HI> a wood<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pegge.</NOTE>. On the retreat of their <HI>Roman</HI> ma&s;ters, the latinized names were dropt, except in a very few in&s;tances, and their own re&s;umed; but the re&s;t of the <HI>Britons,</HI> who &s;ubmitted to the <HI>Saxon</HI> yoke, uni|ver&s;ally received with it the names of places from their con|querors.</P>
<P>THE whole of <HI>Flint&s;hire</HI> was &s;ubdued by the <HI>Saxons</HI> immediately after the taking of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> by <HI>Egbert.</HI> It was an open country, de&s;titute of inacce&s;&s;ible rocks and mountains, like the re&s;t of <HI>North Wales;</HI> and con&s;equently incapable of defence again&s;t &s;o potent an enemy. The conquerors, as u&s;ual, new-named the towns, villages, and hamlets; but could not cancel the antient. Thus <HI>Hawarden</HI> &s;till is known to the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> by the name of <HI>Pen|nardd L&acirc;g,</HI> or <HI>Halawg; Mold</HI> by that of <HI>Wyddgryg;</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> by that of <HI>E&s;tyn;</HI> which (with the continuance of our language to this day) proves that even at that time it mixed but little with our conquerors. Numbers of <HI>Saxons</HI> were &s;ettled among us, who held their lands from the <HI>Mercian</HI> governors or earls: we find in the Doom&s;day book many of their names who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in this tract; &s;uch as <HI>Ulbert, O&s;mer,</HI> and <HI>Elmer.</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t notice of any &s;ub-divi&s;ion of the tract called <HI>Flint|&s;hire,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">DOOMSDAY BOOK.</NOTE> appears in the <HI>Doom&s;day</HI> book. When that &s;urvey was taken, it was made a part of <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> to which it was con&s;idered as
<PB N="6" REF="14">
an appendage, by conque&s;t. Old records affirm, that <HI>the county of</HI> FLINT <HI>appertaineth to the dignity of the &s;word of</HI> CHESTER. It was &s;oon &s;ubdued by <HI>Robert de Rothelent,</HI> commander in chief under <HI>Hugh Lupus,</HI> who carried his arms far into <HI>Wales;</HI> and &s;ecured his conque&s;ts in the marches by building, or rather by adding new works to the ca&s;tle of <HI>Rudland,</HI> which he had wre&s;ted from one of our princes.</P>
<P>THE tract from <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> to the <HI>Clwyd</HI> was then con&s;idered as a hundred of <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> and called in the Doom&s;day Book <HI>Ati&s;cros</HI> hundred. Numbers of places &s;till exi&s;ting are mentioned in it, di&s;gui&s;ed often by the <HI>Norman</HI> &s;pelling. <HI>Whiteford,</HI> the place in que&s;tion, is called <HI>Widford:</HI> notice is al&s;o taken of &s;ome of the pre&s;ent town&s;hips, &s;uch as <HI>Tre-mo&s;tyn, Tre-bychton,</HI> and <HI>Merton,</HI> under the names of <HI>Mo&s;tone, Wid&s;ord, Putecaine,</HI> and <HI>Meretone.</HI> MOSTONE was then a <HI>plough-land, terra unius Carucae.</HI> It had on it four villeyns and eight boors; (<HI>Bordarii</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Borda &s;ignifies a cottage, with a &s;mall piece of land annexed, held by the &s;ervice of finding for the lord, poultry, eggs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for his <HI>bwrdd,</HI> or table.</NOTE>,) a wood a league long, and forty perches, <HI>particatae,</HI> broad, and was valued at twenty &s;hillings.</P>
<P>WIDFORD is joined with <HI>Putecaine:</HI> The fir&s;t &s;eems to have com|prehended our pre&s;ent <HI>Trelan,</HI> or the place where the church-village now &s;tands. The&s;e had one plough-land, two villeyns, and twelve others between men and maid &s;ervants, fi&s;heries, and a wood half a league long and forty perches broad; the value was the &s;ame with that of <HI>Mo&s;tone.</HI></P>
<P>WITH <HI>Meretone</HI> is joined the third part of <HI>Widford;</HI> and the <HI>Berewicha</HI> or hamlet of <HI>Caldecote,</HI> the la&s;t at pre&s;ent a town&s;hip

As piety gained &s;trength, other churches, for the conveniency of the devout, were erected by the no|bility and men of property, who were de&s;irous of &s;piri|tual a&s;&s;i&s;tance within their precincts; and to this were owing the churches, which, at the period in que&s;tion, were &s;o &s;par|ingly &s;cattered over the land.

At one end of the gallery is a great room, remarkable for a &s;ingular event. During the time that <HI>Henry</HI> earl of <HI>Richmond</HI> was &s;ecretly laying the foundation of the overthrow of the hou&s;e of <HI>York,</HI> he pa&s;&s;ed concealed from place to place, in order to form an intere&s;t among the <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> who favored his cau&s;e on account of their re|&s;pect to his granfather, <HI>Owen Tudor,</HI> their countryman.

It is ob&s;ervable, that none of our hi&s;torians account for a certain period of <HI>Henry</HI>'s life, previous to his acce&s;&s;ion.

<P>THERE is little more remarkable about the hou&s;e than what is common to others built at different times.

<P>HENRY II. in 1157, after his e&s;cape from the ambu&s;cade of <HI>Eulo,</HI> left <HI>Ba&s;ingwerk</HI> re&s;tored, well fortified, and manned<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M.Paris, 129.</NOTE>, in order to &s;ecure a retreat on any future di&s;a&s;ter.

After his defeat he never tru&s;ted him&s;elf among our woods; but made his marches along the open &s;hores.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame monarch left another &s;pecies of garri&s;on<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Powel, 208.</NOTE>; for he e&s;tabli&s;hed here a hou&s;e of knights templars, a military order introduced into <HI>England</HI> in the preceding reign. They were fir&s;t in&s;tituted in the Holy Land for the protection of pilgrims; and po&s;&s;ibly <HI>Henry</HI> might have, the &s;ame view in fixing them here, to &s;ecure the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> devotees in performing their vows to our neighboring &s;aint, who &s;eems about this time to have come into reputation. It is &s;ingular, that the&s;e religious knights were allowed at their in&s;titution only one hor&s;e between two; yet &s;o greatly did they flouri&s;h, that about the year 1240, or a hundred and fifty years after their in&s;titution, the order had acquired, in different parts of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> nineteen thou&s;and manors.</P>
<P>THIS ca&s;tle was but of very &s;hort duration; for in 1165, the gallant prince <HI>Owen Gwynedd</HI> laid &s;iege to it, took<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame, 223.</NOTE> and levelled it to the ground; after which the name occurs no more as a

For my part, I believe it to be of greater antiquity; but do not pretend to derive its origin. No light into the matter can be collected from the charters pre&s;erved by Sir <HI>William Dugdale.</HI>
There are three of them, either &s;erving to confirm the antient donations, or confer new: in each is mention of the earl as a benefactor; but there is not the left hint of his having been the founder. I mu&s;t attribute that honor to one of the princes of <HI>Wales;</HI> for both <HI>Lhewelyn ap Jor|werth,</HI> and his &s;on <HI>David,</HI> in their re&s;pective charters recite, that they give and confirm the &s;everal donations to GOD, St.<HI>Mary,</HI> the mona&s;tery of <HI>Ba&s;ingwerk,</HI> and the monks, which had been be&s;towed on them by their predece&s;&s;ors for the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>RANDAL was certainly a great benefactor; for it appears, that before his days the monks had only a chapel here. From that period it became con&s;iderable; and about that time part of the pre&s;ent buildings were erected, for the conveniency of its inhabit|ants, who were of the <HI>Ci&s;torcian</HI> order.</P>
<P>THE architecture is mixed. Here appears what is called <HI>Saxon;</HI> having the round arches and &s;hort columns in &s;ome parts; and the</P>

<P>THE church lay on the ea&s;t &s;ide; but is now totally de|&s;troyed. The refectory is pretty entire; and on one &s;ide has a great rece&s;s, with two round arches and a plain in front.</P>

<P>THE chapel of the knights templars is a &s;pacious building. The windows are long, narrow, and pointed; the pila&s;ters be|tween them on the in&s;ide &s;lender and elegant.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome remains of offices, u&s;ed at pre&s;ent by a tanner. Within le&s;s than fifty years, much of the habitable part was &s;tanding; and &s;ometimes u&s;ed by the worthy family, the <HI>Mo&s;tyns</HI> of <HI>Trelacre:</HI> a lady now living was born within the walls.</P>

<P>OVER one of the le&s;&s;er arches, on each &s;ide of the well, are the dragon and gre-hound, the &s;upporters of the arms of <HI>Eng|land</HI> during the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. and part of that of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. The fir&s;t was born by <HI>Henry</HI> VII. as a badge of the hou&s;e of <HI>Tudor,</HI> which derived it&s;elf from <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> la&s;t king of <HI>Britain,</HI> who bore on his en&s;ign a red dragon. <HI>Henry,</HI> in imitation of him, at the battle of <HI>Bo&s;worth</HI> carried on his &s;tandard a red dragon, painted on white and green &s;ilk; which afterwards gave ri&s;e to the office of <HI>Rouge dragon</HI> among the heralds.</P>
<P>ON one &s;ide of a wall that &s;upports the roof, was painted the tale of the tutelar &s;aint; at pre&s;ent almo&s;t defaced: over it is in&s;cribed, <HI>in honorem Sanctae Wenefredae,</HI> V. &amp; M.</P>
<P>IN another wall is an elegant nich, in which &s;tood a &s;tatue of the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> pulled down, as I have been informed, in the year 1635.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o heard, that there had been another of St. <HI>Wene|frede.</HI> To grace the image on high fe&s;tivals, it is probable, that <HI>I&s;abel,</HI> counte&s;s of <HI>Warwick,</HI> widow to the great <HI>Richard Beauchamp,</HI> left to St. <HI>Wenefrede,</HI> in 1439, her gown of ru&s;&s;et velvet<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Warwick&s;hire, I. 414.</NOTE>.</P>

The chapel is the property of <HI>John Davies</HI> e&s;quire, of <HI>Llanerch.</HI> The well is common; for I find by a deci&s;ion of the court of chancery, on a law-&s;uit re&s;pecting the lord&s;hip of <HI>Holywell,</HI> between Sir <HI>John Egerton</HI> knight, and <HI>John Eldred;</HI> chancellor <HI>Elle&s;mere</HI> decrees, <Q>That on calling to mind, that within the &s;aid manor there is a fountain or well of antient and worthy memory, he doth not think fit that the petitioner, or any other, &s;hould have the property thereof, notwith&s;tanding the general words of the grant of the manor: and therefore his lord&s;hip doth order, that notwith&s;tanding the &s;aid grant, that the well &s;hall continue as now it is, or heretofore hath been; &s;aving to the petitioner, and his heirs and a&s;&s;igns, the benefit of the &s;tream and watercour&s;e, with the appertainances.</Q></P>
<P>THERE are two different opinions about the origin of this &s;tream. One party makes it miraculous: the other a&s;&s;ert it to be owing only to natural cau&s;es. The advocates for the fir&s;t, deliver their tale thus:</P>
<P>IN the &s;eventh century lived a virgin of the name of <HI>Wene&s;rede,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">OF SAINT WING FREDE.</NOTE> of noble parents; her father's name was <HI>Thewith,</HI> a potent lord in the parts where <HI>Holywell</HI> now &s;tands; her mother's, <HI>Wenlo,</HI> de|&s;cended from an antient family in <HI>Montgomery&s;hire,</HI> and &s;i&s;ter to

<P>ST. BEUNO took up the head, carried it to the corps, and, offering up his devotions, joined it nicely to the body, which in&s;tantly re-united.

<P>A FRATERNITY and gild was e&s;tabli&s;hed in honor of our faint at <HI>Shrew&s;bury.</HI> It had its common &s;eal, which, through the kindne&s;s of my friend, Mr. <HI>Henry Leving&s;ton,</HI> is now in my po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. It is of copper, of the form expre&s;&s;ed in the plate. In the centre is a repre&s;entation of the martyrdom; above is a cro&s;s in form of a T, placed between the letters <HI>T. m.</HI> which mark the time when the fraternity was in&s;tituted, during the abbacy of <HI>Thomas Mynde;</HI> who was elected in 1459, and died in 1499, a period in which the&s;e religious &s;ocieties were much in fa&s;hion. The T or cro&s;s refers to the church of <HI>St. Cro&s;s</HI> within this mona&s;tery. Beneath are probably the arms of the hou&s;e, a &s;word and a key, &s;ymbols of its tutelar apo&s;tles; and round the mar|gin is this in&s;cription:</P>

<P>A bell belonging to the church was al&s;o chri&s;tened in honor of her. I cannot learn the names of the go&s;&s;ips, who, as u&s;ual, were doubtle&s;sly rich per&s;ons.

which the prie&s;t received in behalf of the bell. Thus ble&s;&s;ed, it was endowed with great powers; allayed (on being rung) all &s;torms; diverted the thunder-bolt; drove away evil &s;pi|rits. The&s;e con&s;ecrated bells were always in&s;cribed. The in|&s;cription on that in que&s;tion ran thus:</P>
<Q><L>Sancta <HI>Wenefreda,</HI> Deo hoc commendare memento,</L>
<L>Ut pietate &s;ua, nos &s;ervet ab ho&s;te cruento.</L></Q>
<P>And a little lower was another addre&s;s:</P>
<Q>Protege Prece pia, quos convoco, virgo <HI>Maria.</HI></Q>
<P>AFTER her death, her &s;anctity, &s;ays her hi&s;torian, was proved by numberle&s;s miracles. The waters were almo&s;t as &s;anative as tho&s;e of the pool of <HI>Bethe&s;da:</HI> all infirmities incident to the human body met with relief; the votive crutches, the barrows, and other proofs of cures, to this moment remain as evidences pen|dent over the well.

<P>WE, who&s;e ance&s;tors, between two and three centuries ago, abridged our faith to the mere contents of the Old and New Te&s;tament, and to the creed called the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> do not think
<PB N="37" REF="51">
the belief in the above, and other legends, requi&s;ite. I refer the reader to the arguments u&s;ed by the antiquary Doctor <HI>Powel,</HI> in his notes on the Itinerary of <HI>Giraldus Cambren&s;is,</HI> and to bi&s;hop <HI>Fleetwood</HI>'s annotations on the life of the &s;aint, for proofs again&s;t the truth of the tale: but with Prote&s;tants, and temperate Catho|lics, it carries with it &s;elf-confutation.</P>
<P>THE waters are indi&s;putably endowed with every good quality attendant on cold baths; and multitudes have here experienced the good effects that thus re&s;ult from natural qualities, implanted in the &s;everal parts of matter by the divine Providence in order to fulfil his will. Heaven for a &s;hort period deigned to convince a dark and obdurate age with a &s;eries of miracles; which were de|livered down to &s;ucceeding times, as inconte&s;tible proofs of the reality of the divine mi&s;&s;ion. Without them, a &s;ufficient ground of tru&s;t and reliance upon the Supreme Being has long &s;ince been e&s;tabli&s;hed. Second cau&s;es innumerable are di&s;per&s;ed throughout the univer&s;e, &s;ubordinate to the FIRST. Every element proves to us a medicine or a bane, as &s;uits His unerring di&s;pen&s;a|tion. We cannot want, we cannot have the mediation of poor departed mortals. The &s;uppo&s;ition would be be&s;tow|ing on them the attributes of the Deity; omnipre&s;ence and omni&s;cience.</P>
<P>SOME eminent botani&s;ts of my acquaintance have reduced the &s;weet mo&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOSSES</NOTE> and the bloody &s;tains, to mere vegetable produc|tions, far from being peculiar to our fountain. The fir&s;t is that kind of mo&s;s called a <HI>Jungermannia,</HI> imperfectly de&s;cribed and figured by <HI>Dillenius,</HI> in his hi&s;tory of mo&s;&s;es; which has induced us to give a new engraving of it.

<P><PB N="39" REF="53">IT is &s;ingular, that no mention is made in the Doom&s;day book of either chapel, church, or well; yet town&s;hips now of le&s;s note are named; &s;uch as <HI>Brunford Caldecote,</HI> and others. Notwith&s;tanding bi&s;hop <HI>Fleetwood</HI>'s opinion, I think the legend of St. <HI>Wenefrede</HI> was known previous to that &s;urvey; for the very name of <HI>Holywell</HI> is <HI>Saxon,</HI> probably be&s;towed on it before the Conque&s;t, on account of the imputed &s;anctity of the well.</P>
<P>THE &s;pring is certainly one of the fine&s;t in the&s;e kingdoms; and, by the two different trials and calculations lately made for my information, is found to fling out about twenty-one tons of water in a minute. It never freezes; or &s;carcely varies in the quantity of water, in droughts or after the greate&s;t rains. After a violent fall of wet, it becomes di&s;colored by a wheyey tinge.</P>
<P>THE &s;tream formed by this fountain runs with a rapid cour&s;e to the &s;ea, which it reaches in little more than a mile's di&s;tance. The indu&s;try of this century hath made its waters of much com|mercial utility. The principal works on it at this time are bat|tering mills for copper; a wire-mill, coar&s;e paper mill, &s;nuff|mill, a foundery for bra&s;s; and at this time, a cotton manu|factory is e&s;tabli&s;hing, the &s;ucce&s;s of which will be an exten&s;ive ble&s;&s;ing to the neighborhood.</P>
<P>DURING the reign of pilgrimages, nothing but a corn-mill or two, the property of the monks, found employ for this bene|ficial &s;tream.</P>
<P>THE town was al&s;o very incon&s;iderable till the beginning of this century; the hou&s;es few, and tho&s;e for the mo&s;t part
<PB N="40" REF="54">
thatched; the &s;treets unpaved; and the place de&s;titute of a mar|ket. The flouri&s;hing mines, that for &s;ome time were di&s;covered in the neighborhood, made a great change in the appearance, and introduced the effects of wealth. The town, or rather town&s;hip, contains &s;omewhat more than two thou&s;and &s;ouls.</P>
<P>THE monks of <HI>Ba&s;ingwerk</HI> obtained for it the grant of a fair and a market. The fir&s;t has been dropt beyond the memory of man. The market was al&s;o lo&s;t, till it was renewed by letters patent, dated <HI>Jan.</HI> 20th, 1703, granted to Sir <HI>John Egerton</HI> baronet. The patent al&s;o contains a grant of three fairs, <HI>viz.</HI> on the 23d of <HI>April,</HI> the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> in <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> week, and the 2d of <HI>September.</HI> The market has been the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing in <HI>North Wales;</HI> but the fairs never could be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation of the town is plea&s;ant and healthy. On the back is a lofty hill, at times extremely productive of lead ore. Towards the &s;ea is a pretty valley, bounded by woods: the end fini&s;hes on one &s;ide with the venerable abby.

<P>MY next vi&s;it was to <HI>Flint.</HI> I took the lower road, by the &s;hore, blackened with the &s;moke of &s;melting-hou&s;es; and, in the more flouri&s;hing times of the collieries, with va&s;t &s;tacks of coal.

I cannot a&s;&s;ign any derivation of the word: our county is totally de&s;titute of the fo&s;&s;il u&s;ually &s;o called. I can only remark, that it is purely <HI>Saxon;</HI> and, not|with&s;tanding it is not mentioned in the Doom&s;day book, was called &s;o before the Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS place al&s;o &s;eems to me to have been the &s;ame with what was named <HI>Col&s;ul</HI> or <HI>Cole&s;hill.</HI> I can find no other &s;ite for the chapel of <HI>Col&s;ul,</HI> granted by <HI>David ap Llewelyn</HI> to the abby of <HI>Ba&s;ingwerk.</HI> The pre&s;ent <HI>Flint</HI> probably went at this period under both names. There is no trace of any chapel in the neighborhood excepting this; nor any other place of con&s;equence enough to tempt our princes to live at. It was called in the Doom&s;day book <HI>Cole&s;elt;</HI> and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Rudland. Edwin</HI> held it from him, and as a free-man. Here was one hide of land taxable.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="56">THE whole place appears to have been founded in times of dan|ger; and every provi&s;ion made again&s;t an attack from a people recently &s;ubdued, and who had &s;ubmitted reluctantly to a foreign yoke. The town is formed on the principle of a <HI>Roman</HI> en|campment, being rectangular, and &s;urrounded with a va&s;t ditch and two great ramparts, with the four regular <HI>portae,</HI> as u&s;ual with that military nation. I &s;hall hereafter give a conjecture of the probability of its having been a <HI>Roman</HI> &s;tation.</P>
<P>THE public buildings within this precinct are the church, the town-hall, and the jail; not one of which is any ornament to this little capital. The church, or rather chapel, is dedi|cated to St. <HI>Mary;</HI> and is only a perpetual curacy under <HI>Nor|thop.</HI> I imagine this to have been the <HI>capella de Col&s;ul</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale Mona&s;t. I. 720.</NOTE>, belong|ing to the abby of <HI>Ba&s;ingwerk,</HI> mentioned in the charter of <HI>David ap Llewelyn;</HI> at le&s;t, I can trace no other. <HI>Flint,</HI> in that time, was probably comprehended under the name of <HI>Col&s;ul.</HI></P>
<P>THE ca&s;tle &s;tands on a low free-&s;tone rock that juts into the &s;ands, a little north-ea&s;t of the town; and was once joined to it by a bridge which led to the outwork, called the <HI>Barbican;</HI> a &s;quare tower, with a gateway, now entirely demoli&s;hed. Within was a court &s;urrounded with a ditch faced with a wall, that joined by means of a drawbridge to the main fortre&s;s; who&s;e entrance, for better &s;ecurity, was little more than a po&s;tern.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;tle is a &s;quare building, with a large round tower at three of the corners, and a fourth a little disjoined from the other, and much larger than the re&s;t. This is called the <HI>double tower.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="57"><FIGURE>

<P><PB N="43" REF="58">
It had been joined to the ca&s;tle by a drawbridge, and is of great thickne&s;s. It has a circular gallery beneath, vaulted, with four arched openings into a central area, a little more than twenty-two feet in diameter. In one part, the gallery is &s;uddenly low|ered, and goes &s;loping towards the ca&s;tle; and then ri&s;ing upwards, makes a &s;ort of communication with an upper gallery.</P>
<P>THIS was the Keep, or &s;trong part of the ca&s;tle, and the &s;ame that the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>le Dongeon;</HI> to which, as <HI>Froi&s;&s;art</HI> informs us, the unfortunate <HI>Richard</HI> II. retired, as the place of greate&s;t &s;ecurity, when he was taken by <HI>Bolingbroke.</HI></P>
<P>THE channel of the <HI>Dee</HI> at pre&s;ent is at &s;ome di&s;tance from the walls; but formerly flowed beneath. There are &s;till in &s;ome parts rings, to which &s;hips were moored.</P>
<P>THE founder of this ca&s;tle is uncertain. <HI>Cambden</HI> attributes it to <HI>Henry</HI> II. and his noble hi&s;storian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord <HI>Lyttelton.</HI></NOTE> is of the &s;ame opinion. After his e&s;cape at <HI>Euloe,</HI> it is po&s;&s;ible that he might have begun a fortre&s;s here for &s;ecurity in future times; that he might have left it incomplete; and that it was fini&s;hed by <HI>Edward</HI> I. The rolls of the la&s;t reign mention the place &s;everal times.</P>
<P>IN the year 1277, there was an order for proclaming a mar|ket and fair to be held at <HI>Flint;</HI> and the &s;ame was afterwards done through <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> and the cantreds of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>IN 1280, appears an order for the cu&s;tody of the gate of the ca&s;tle of <HI>Flint.</HI> Perhaps this might have been the year in which it was fir&s;t garri&s;oned.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="59">
IN 1283, the town received its fir&s;t charter; was made a free borough; and the mayor &s;worn faithfully to pre&s;erve its liberties. This is dated at <HI>Flint</HI> on the 8th of <HI>September:</HI> it was confirmed again in the 2d and 3d years of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> and afterwards in the 12th of <HI>William</HI> III.</P>
<P>IN 1283, the burge&s;&s;es al&s;o received a grant from <HI>Edward,</HI> of timber out of the woods of <HI>Northop, Ledebroke</HI> the greater and le&s;&s;er, <HI>Keldre&s;ton, Wol&s;ynton, Weper,</HI> and <HI>Sutton,</HI> in order to &s;melt their lead ore; and at the &s;ame time a right of pa&s;turage in the &s;ame woods.</P>
<P>IN 1290, there is an order for &s;uperintending the works of this ca&s;tle, and tho&s;e of <HI>Rudland</HI> and <HI>Che&s;ter;</HI> places of the fir&s;t importance, on the borders of a new-conquered country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rotuli <HI>Walliae,</HI> 98</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t great event that occurs to me re&s;pecting this for|tre&s;s is in the year 1280, when the <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> wearied with the reitera|tion of oppre&s;&s;ion, as a &s;ignal of general in&s;urrection, &s;urprized the place<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">76.</NOTE>; at the &s;ame time that <HI>David,</HI> brother of <HI>Llewelyn;</HI> took <HI>Hawarden;</HI> and <HI>Rees</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Malgon,</HI> and <HI>Griffith ap Meredeth ap Owen,</HI> &s;eized the ca&s;tle of <HI>Abery&s;twyth</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Powel, 337.</NOTE>.</P>

In 1643, it was clo&s;ely be&s;ieged by Sir <HI>Wil|liam Brereton</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas Middleton;</HI> and was defended by the governor till all provi&s;ions, even to hor&s;es, failing, he then &s;urren|dered it upon honorable terms.</P>

<P>FLINT fell afterwards into the hands of the loyali&s;ts; for, under the year 1646, I find in the &s;ame hi&s;torian, that the garri&s;on &s;eemed inclinable to come to a treaty.

<P>ABOUT a mile from the town, on the lower road to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> &s;tood a cro&s;s, who&s;e pede&s;tal I remember, which was called <HI>Atis-cro&s;s,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ATIS-CROSS.</NOTE> and the land around is &s;till called Croes-ati. This probably was a place of note; for, at the Conque&s;t, it gave name to a very con&s;iderable hundred, at that time con&s;idered as part of <HI>Che&s;hire. Exe&s;tan</HI> was another, now given to <HI>Flint&s;hire;</HI> which will be noticed in its place.</P>
<P>THERE is a tradition, that in very old times there &s;tood a large town at this place; and it is &s;aid the foundations of build|ings have been frequently turned up by the plough. But what is mo&s;t remarkable, is the great quantities of &s;coria of lead, bits of lead ore, and fragments of melted lead, di&s;covered in &s;everal &s;pots here, and along the country, ju&s;t above the &s;hore, in the adjoining pari&s;h of <HI>Northop.</HI> The&s;e have of late been di&s;|covered to contain &s;uch quantities of lead, as to encourage the wa&s;hers of ore to farm the &s;pots. In this tract, numbers of tons have been gotten within a &s;mall time, e&s;pecially at <HI>Pentre</HI> FFWRN-DAN, or the <HI>place of the fiery furnace;</HI> a name it was al|ways known by, and which evinces the antiquity of &s;melting in

<P>In page 42 I mentioned my &s;u&s;picion, that the precinct of <HI>Flint</HI> town once &s;erved to inclo&s;e a &s;mall <HI>Roman</HI> &s;tation: I am confirmed in my opinion, from the multitudes of <HI>Roman</HI> coins, <HI>Fibulae,</HI> and variety of antique in&s;truments, lately di&s;covered by the workmen in the old wa&s;hes of this and the next pari&s;h; which prove that the <HI>Romans</HI> made this their port for exporting the metal, after it was fu&s;ed from the ore of the adjacent mountains. Here might be placed a &s;mall garri&s;on to protect the antient &s;melters, or to collect the duties, or to receive the tribute of metal. Previous to the &s;ettlement of the <HI>Romans</HI> in <HI>Britain, Strabo</HI> &s;peaks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. iv. p. 307.</NOTE> &s;o &s;lightly of our articles of commerce, as to &s;ay, they were not worth the expence of one legion and a few hor&s;e.

<P>IN a &s;mall time after the <HI>Romans</HI> had carried their arms through our i&s;land, they began to apply with vigor to the working of the mines. At fir&s;t, the ore of lead was got with ea&s;e: it offered it&s;elf on the &s;urface. In <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Gaul,</HI> much labor was required to dig it up; in <HI>Britain</HI> it was found near the common &s;oil<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plinii,</HI> Hi&s;t.

<P>OF &s;uch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROMAN PIGS OF LEAD</NOTE> I have &s;een three, found in different parts of Bri|tain: the one in <HI>Hints,</HI> common, in the manor of <HI>Ralph Floyer</HI> e&s;quire, in the county of Stafford, in the year 1771.

<PB N="56" REF="71">
is twenty-two inches and a half; the weight a hundred and fifty-two pounds, about two pounds heavier than our common pigs of lead. On the upper &s;urface is a rim; within that, in rai&s;ed capitals, &s;truck when the metal was hot, is this in&s;cription: IMP.x.VESP+<ABBR>VII</ABBR>xTxIMPx<ABBR>V</ABBR>xCOS. or <HI>Imperatore</HI> VES|PASIANO <HI>Septim&ugrave;m</HI> TITO <HI>Imperatore quint&ugrave;m Con&s;ule:</HI> which an&s;wers to the year 75 or 76.</P>
<P>ON one &s;ide is the word DECEA, and at a di&s;tance the letter G.

For my part, I am of opinion, that DECEA had once between it and the G, the letter N; which will render it DECEANG, or <HI>de Ceangis,</HI> the place which produced the ore; but by &s;ome accident that letter was defaced, and the G left &s;eemingly un|connected. This explanation will fling light on certain pieces of lead de&s;cribed by <HI>Cambden,</HI> to be taken notice of a few lines lower.</P>

<P>IN the time of <HI>Cambden,</HI> twenty pieces of lead, &s;imilar to the above, were found near <HI>Halton</HI> in <HI>Che&s;hire;</HI> &s;ome in&s;cribed, IMP. DOMIT. AUG. C.

The&s;e have been &s;uppo&s;ed to commemorate a victory over the <HI>Cangi;</HI> but it is evident that they were nothing more than pigs of lead brought here for u&s;e, or for tran&s;portation: and I am farther &s;atisfied, that the ore which produced this lead was dug and &s;melted, either in that part of <HI>Flint&s;hire</HI> an|tiently called <HI>Tegangle,</HI> or the &s;ummer's re&s;idence of the <HI>Cangi,</HI> or <HI>Ceangi;</HI> or from the re&s;idence of the &s;ame order of people either in <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> or &s;ome neighboring county. This gives rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that the&s;e <HI>Cangi,</HI> during their long vacant time, might &s;ometimes engage in mineral concerns; and then the ore, when &s;melted, might receive the mark of the people from whom it was received. The pig of lead in Mr. <HI>Green</HI>'s cabinet, certain|ly came from the <HI>Cangi</HI> of <HI>Derby&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the regulation mentioned by <HI>Pliny,</HI> and all the&s;e impe|rial in&s;criptions, it is clear, that the public took the mineral concerns into its own hands; and had their &s;tamp-ma&s;ters in proper places.

<P>THE <HI>Romans</HI> found &s;uch plenty of &s;ilver in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> mines, that for &s;ome time they never thought it worth their labor to extract it from lead<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strabo, <HI>lib.</HI> iii. p. 221.</NOTE>. In later times, they di&s;covered an ore that contained &s;ilver, tin, and lead; and the&s;e three metals were &s;melted from it. It appears, that the fir&s;t product was the tin; the &s;econd, the &s;ilver; and what <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Galaena,</HI> which was left behind in the furnace, and &s;eems to be the &s;ame with our <HI>litharge,</HI> and being melted again, became lead, or, as the antients called it (to di&s;tingui&s;h it from white lead or tin) <HI>black lead</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plinii, <HI>lib.</HI> xxxiv. c. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> name of lead is lo&s;t. The only word we have to expre&s;s an ore is <HI>mwyn;</HI> but the &s;pecies is expre&s;&s;ed by an ad|junct, as <HI>mwyn aur,</HI> gold, <HI>mwyn plwm,</HI> lead ore; both which were probably derived from the <HI>Latin.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> made u&s;e of the word <HI>metallum</HI> to expre&s;s ore, as well as the metal fu&s;ed from it: the word <HI>minera</HI> is a word of a barbarous age, and pro|bably derived from our <HI>mwyn.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL fini&s;h this account of the <HI>Roman</HI> &s;tate of the lead concerns, with ob&s;erving, that they appeared to have been well ver&s;ed in metallurgy, and to have had their &s;melting-hou&s;es. The ruder <HI>Britons,</HI> before their conque&s;t by the <HI>Romans,</HI> had a very &s;imple proce&s;s. They placed the ore in a hole in the ground, and mixed it with wood; which being fired, proved
<PB N="59" REF="74">
sufficient to melt the lead out of the &s;oft and kindly ores of this country; a &s;mall gutter communicated with a &s;econd hole, into which the metal ran from the fir&s;t. The&s;e artle&s;s &s;lag-hearths are very frequent in our county, di&s;covered by the quantity of <HI>&s;coria</HI> mixed with charcoal. Some of our modern &s;melters have endeavoured to extract the remaining part of the metal from the&s;e &s;lags, but in vain; the antient &s;melters having &s;o effectually done their bu&s;ine&s;s, as not to have left behind &s;ufficient to pay the expences of a &s;econd operation: the mo&s;t that could be procured from a ton of &s;lags, amounting only to about a hundred and fifty pounds weight.</P>
<P>I CANNOT tell what u&s;e the <HI>Britons</HI> made of the metal, except|ing as an article of commerce. I mu&s;t not dare to a&s;&s;ent to the tale of the venerable <HI>Bede</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. i. c. 2. p. 42.</NOTE>, who &s;ays, that the &s;takes driven in|to the <HI>Thames,</HI> to ob&s;truct the pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> were wrapped round with lead. The project was u&s;ele&s;s, This expedient of the <HI>Britons</HI> was temporary; the &s;takes did not require &s;uch a covering to pre&s;erve them; and the metal of lead was &s;urely very improper to point them with.</P>
<P>I am of opinion, that there had been in our country a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of founderies of lead, from the time of the <HI>Romans</HI> to the pre&s;ent, at every period in which the civil commotions would permit them to be carried on. The <HI>Saxons</HI> worked the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> mines as well as the <HI>Romans,</HI> and made frequent u&s;e of the lead in all works of eccle&s;ia&s;tial magnificence.

<P>I &s;hall take this opportunity of mentioning incidentally the other minerals of <HI>Greet Britain,</HI> taken notice of by the antients, either as articles of trade or matters of curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>TIN was aot only the fir&s;t metal in the&s;e i&s;lands which we read of;<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIN</NOTE> but al&s;o the greate&s;t object of commerce; and which originally led to the di&s;covery of <HI>Great Britain</HI> by the <HI>Romans.</HI> The mercantile <HI>Phoenicians</HI> traded to the <HI>Silley</HI> i&s;lands, the <HI>Ca&s;&s;i|terides,</HI> or land of tin, from the port of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> four hundred years before CHRIST. The <HI>Romans,</HI> for a con&s;iderable &s;pace, could not di&s;cover the place from whence the former procured the precious, metal. They attempted to detect the trade, by following the cour&s;e of a <HI>Phoenician</HI> ve&s;&s;el; but the ma&s;ter, faithful to the in|tere&s;t of his country, voluntarily run his &s;hip a&s;hore in another, place; preferring the lo&s;s of all, rather than &s;uffer a foreign na|tion to become partakers of &s;o profitable a &s;ecret. The public immediately compen&s;ated his lo&s;s out of its trea&s;ury. This did
<PB N="61" REF="76">
but make the <HI>Romans</HI> more eager after the di&s;covery; and after many trials, &s;ucceeded. <HI>Publius Cra&s;&s;us</HI> (father of <HI>Marcus Cra&s;&s;us</HI> the <HI>Triumvir)</HI> who was praetor, and governed <HI>Spain</HI> for &s;everal years, landed in the <HI>Ca&s;&s;iterides,</HI> and found the report of their riches verified<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strabo,</HI> lib. iii. p. 265. to 309</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the <HI>Romans</HI> made a conque&s;t of the country, they formed in the tin province camps and roads, &s;till vi&s;ible; and left behind va&s;es, urns, &s;epulchres, and money, that exhibit daily proofs of their having been a &s;tationary people in tho&s;e parts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Borla&s;e, Antiq.

<P>IT is not to be imagined, that they could neglect a corner of our i&s;land, productive of a metal &s;o u&s;eful in mechanics as tin, and which it yielded in &s;uch plenty, as to receive from that circum&s;tance the name.

that aro&s;e in con&s;equence.

The civil wars, which broke out immediately after, fru&s;trated this wi&s;e mea&s;ure. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> re&s;umed it, being too quick-&s;ighted not to &s;ee into the defects and wants of her kingdom. She not only adopted it, but improved on the plan. Our knowlege of minerals was almo&s;t extingui&s;hed, and of cour&s;e the manufactures which depended on them. We imported our &s;words, our knives, &s;tir|rups, bits, and even our pins, out of <HI>Germany,</HI> through the channel of the <HI>Netherlands.</HI> Our works of bra&s;s, and even our wire, excepting a &s;mall quantity which was worked by hand, were of foreign fabrick. The fir&s;t &s;tep taken by this politic prince&s;s, was to forbid the importation of the&s;e and &s;everal other articles, from parts beyond &s;ea<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Statute 5th <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> c. 7.</NOTE>: the next, was to invite into her kingdom foreign miners, foreign &s;melters, and foreign arti|ficers of metallic productions.</P>
<P>SHE next formed a corporation, under the title of THE SOCIETY FOR THE MINES ROYAL. The fir&s;t governor was <HI>William</HI> earl of <HI>Pembroke:</HI> &s;everal men of rank were joined in the commi&s;|&s;ion as a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and &s;everal citizens, and &s;ome foreigners of known experience in the&s;e matters.

The&s;e corporations were founded on <HI>May</HI> the 28th 1567.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="96">SOME progre&s;s had been made, a few years before, for the procuring materials for the&s;e new manufactures; for in 1563, &s;he had granted the mines of eight counties, be&s;ides tho&s;e in <HI>Wales,</HI> to <HI>Daniel Hough&s;etter:</HI> in 1564, &s;he made another grant to <HI>Cornelius Devo&s;&s;e;</HI> and a third in the &s;ame year, more com|prehen&s;ive than all, to <HI>Chri&s;topher Shutz,</HI> of all mines, minerals, and &s;ubterraneous trea&s;ures, (except copperas and allum) which &s;hall be found in all other parts of <HI>England</HI> (not mentioned in the former patent) or within the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pale in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by the name of gold, &s;ilver, copper, tin, lead, quick&s;ilver, <HI>cadmian</HI> ore, or <HI>lapis calaminaris;</HI> and all manner of ewres or oares, &s;imple or pure, mixt or compounded for latten wire or &s;teel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To each of the&s;e patentees an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> was joined.</P>
<P>IT is worth ob&s;erving, that the crown, in mo&s;t of the&s;e grants, lays ab&s;olute clame to all mines what&s;oever, under a notion that they are royal mines; yet the prerogative could only be entitled to &s;uch which yielded gold and &s;ilver. The ori|gin of this pretence aro&s;e from the king's right of coinage, in order that he might have the requi&s;ite materials; which would have confined him to the two noble metals. But until the happy period arrived when our con&s;titution was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the royal and the private property ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed, the &s;ubject was too weak to a&s;&s;ert his rightful clame. ELIZABETH her&s;elf was too fond of the darling prerogative (even with all her boa&s;ted love to her people) to re&s;ign this part. Her pa|tent to <HI>William Humfrey</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;topher Shutz</HI> is worded in the mo&s;t unlimited manner; for it not only gave them power to &s;ink &s;hafts where&s;oever they plea&s;ed (gardens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> excepted),

but to build hou&s;es requi&s;ite to carry on the works, not only upon the royal deme&s;nes, but in the grounds of any of her &s;ubjects. The &s;pirited <HI>Percies,</HI> in the per&s;on of <HI>Thomas</HI> earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> fir&s;t with&s;tood this inva&s;ion of his right. He conte&s;ted with the crown the title to the copper mines in his manor of <HI>Ke&s;wick;</HI> but the lawyers decided again&s;t him, al|leging, that although the crown had a power to grant away its manors, it had not the power to alienate the mineral, being per|fectly linked to the prerogative of the crown.</P>
<P>BUT, as u&s;ual, the gentlemen of the long robe had two opinions re&s;pecting this point: &s;ome a&s;&s;erting, that if any gold or &s;ilver was found in the mines of ba&s;er metal, the whole would belong to the king; which, in fact, was be&s;towing all the mineral property on the crown, there being &s;carcely any ba&s;e metal but what holds &s;ome particles of the nobler: others again, in a future reign, qualified this by &s;aying, <Q>That although the gold or &s;ilver contained in the ba&s;e metal of a mine, in the hands of a &s;ubject, be of le&s;s value than the ba&s;e metal, yet if the gold or &s;ilver do countervail the charge of re&s;ining it, or be of more worth than the ba&s;e metal &s;pent in re&s;ining it, THIS IS A ROYAL MINE; and as well the ba&s;e metal as the gold and &s;ilver in it, belong to the prerogative of the crown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This opinion was given in 1640, 1641, and &s;ub&s;cribed by <HI>Maynard, Glaw ville,</HI> and others, the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vers of the time.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>SUCH was the &s;tate of the royal clame; &s;o di&s;couraging to the indu&s;try of the &s;ubject, till the great event of the REVO|LUTION,
<PB N="81" REF="98">
when the crown, in the fir&s;t year of <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> fully gave up all preten&s;ions to the mines of copper, tin, iron, and lead, notwith&s;tanding gold or &s;ilver may be extracted from them in any quantities. By a following act, this right was again confirm|ed; only the crown re&s;erved to it&s;elf a power of purcha&s;ing, within thirty days after rai&s;ing, all ores made merchantable, at the fol|lowing rates: copper at 16 <HI>l. per</HI> ton, tin at 40 <HI>l.</HI> lead at 9 l.; and in default of &s;uch payment, the owners were at liberty to di&s;po&s;e of their ore as they plea&s;ed. Thus, as Mr. BLACKSTON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">COMMENTARIES, 4 to, i. 294.</NOTE> ob|&s;erves, the private owners were not di&s;couraged from working mines, through a fear that they may be clamed as royal; neither does the king depart from the ju&s;t rights of his revenue, &s;ince he may have all the precious metal contained in the ore, paying no more for it than the value of the ba&s;e metal is &s;uppo&s;ed to be; to which ba&s;e metal the land-owner is by rea&s;on and law entitled.</P>

The whole was valued at forty &s;hillings; yet on all this were but four vil|leyns, &s;ix boors, and four &s;laves: &s;o low was the &s;tate of popu|lation.</P>
<P>IT is probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROMAN</NOTE> that this place had been a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> po&s;t, oppo&s;ed to the country of the <HI>Cornavii,</HI> and to the invading <HI>Romans.</HI> To the we&s;t of the church, in a field adjoining to the road, is a mount called <HI>Truman</HI>'s hill, within a piece of ground which appears to have been &s;quared, and nicely &s;loped.

<P>ON the death of <HI>Margaret, Hawarden</HI> de&s;ended to <HI>Thomas</HI> earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> gran&s;on to the late earl; and continued in his fa|mily till the execution of the gallant <HI>James</HI> earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> in 1651: &s;oon after his death, it was purcha&s;ed from the agents of &s;eque&s;tration, by &s;erjeant <HI>Glynne.</HI> On the re&s;toration, the Lords made an order, on the 17th of <HI>July</HI> 1660, that the earl of <HI>Derby</HI>'s. and &s;everal other lords e&s;tates, which had been &s;old in the late u&s;urpation, without their con&s;ents, &s;hould be re-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them without mole&s;tation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Drake</HI>'s Parlem.

The propo&s;al was either rejected, or not imme|diately accepted: the con&s;equence of which was, the lo&s;s of the whole to the <HI>Derby</HI> family.

<P>IT appears by the&s;e proceedings, as if the parlement was fearful of the con&s;equences of even an act of ju&s;tice; for, during the long troubles, there had been &s;uch va&s;t change of property, effected by fuch variety of means, that it was apprehended, that the enquiry into the cau&s;es, and the di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of numbers who had quietly enjoyed &s;uch property from their fathers, might be attended with the mo&s;t inflammatory con&s;equences. It is likewi&s;e probable, that many of the members might be intere&s;ted in the event; therefore, were determined to &s;top at once any proceeding that might tend to affect the fortunes of them&s;elves or friends. Numbers of &s;ales were made by the loyali&s;ts them|&s;elves, under the influence of fear. They were content to receive a trifle for the purcha&s;e, rather than lo&s;e the whole by violence; for there were very few who had not incurred a premunire under the ruling powers; which they were glad to get clear of by a &s;eemingly voluntary &s;ale. When they were thus di&s;appointed in the hope of re-enjoyment of their fortunes, they laid the blame on the king, and invented the calumny of his rejecting this bill, after it had been pa&s;&s;ed unanimou&s;ly by both hou&s;es.</P>
<P>DURING the civil wars, this cattle &s;uffered the u&s;ual vici&s;&s;i|tudes of fortune.

I hear you have &s;ome of our late <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> army in your company: they very well know me; and that my Firelocks u&s;e not to parley. Be not unadvi&s;ed; but think of your liberty; for I vow all hopes of relief are taken from you; and our intents are not to &s;tarve you, but to batter and &s;torm you, and then hang you all, and follow the re&s;t of that rebellious crew. I am no bread-and-chee&s;e rogue, but, as ever, a loyali&s;t, and will ever be, while I can write or name</P>

<P>ALL this eloquence would have been flung away, had not more forces on the &s;ide of the king, and want of provi&s;ions on that of the garri&s;on, co-operated with this valiant epi&s;tle. So, as <HI>Ru&s;hworth</HI> &s;ays, <Q>after a fortnight's &s;iege, and much ink and little blood &s;pilt, the ca&s;tle being in want of provi&s;ions, was &s;urrendered to Sir <HI>Michael Earnley,</HI> on condition to march out with half arms and two pair of colors, one flying, and the other furled; and to have a convoy to <HI>Wem</HI> or <HI>Nantwyche.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE royali&s;ts Kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;on or it till after the &s;urrender of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> to Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI> in 1645;<NOTE PLACE="marg">AGAIN IN 1645.</NOTE> when, on <HI>March</HI> 17th, O.

<P>THE remains are a fine circular tower or keep,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DESCRIBED.</NOTE> on the &s;ummit of a mount. This alone is pretty entire. Nothing except this,

and a few walls, and the foundations of &s;ome rooms, exi&s;t at pre|&s;ent; which Sir <HI>John Glynne</HI> has, with great pains, laid open by the removal of the rubbi&s;h. In one place was di&s;covered a long flight of &s;teps, at the bottom of which was a door, and for|merly a draw-bridge, which cro&s;&s;ed a deep long cha&s;m (nicely faced with free&s;tone) to another door leading to two or three &s;mall rooms. Probably they were places of confinement, where pri|&s;oners might be lodged with the utmo&s;t &s;ecurity, after pulling up the bridge over the deep cha&s;m that intervened between them and open day.</P>
<P>THE &s;everal parts of this fortre&s;s &s;eem to have been built at different times. It is &s;urrounded with deep fo&s;&s;es, now filled with trees. In 1665, the timber of the park and deme&s;ne was valued at five thou&s;and pounds, and was &s;old in that century; but the pre&s;ent owner will have the merit of re&s;toring it many|fold to the next, by the va&s;t plantations he has made.</P>
<P>THE living is in the gift of the lord; who pre&s;ents;<NOTE PLACE="marg">RECTORY.</NOTE> and the bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> inducts. The rector does all epi&s;copal acts, ex|cept tho&s;e of ordination and confirmation; and has a peculiar exempt juri&s;diction: grants licences, regi&s;ters and proves wills; and has his court and his proctors.</P>
<P>THE living is at pre&s;ent eleven hundred pounds a year; and, in proportion as the &s;ubjacent lands are cultivated, will experi|ence a far greater improvement.</P>
<P>THE church is a plain but hand&s;ome building, kept in neat and decent repair. The par&s;onage-hou&s;e is new, and &s;uitable to the revenue. The garden is very prettily layed out, upon a high and commanding ground.</P>

He was grateful to his patron; for, being appointed of the committee to receive the protector's &s;cruples about being made king, he urged the acceptance with the utmo&s;t zeal. It is amu&s;ing to compare the change of &s;entiment, from the year 1648, when the kingly office was voted to be unnece&s;&s;ary, burthen&s;ome, and dangerous, with the opinion of 1657, when the learned &s;erjeant tells <HI>Cromwel,</HI> that it is e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ettlement of the nation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Parliament Hi&s;t. xxi. 90.</NOTE>.

The prudent lawyer maintained his ground till the year of the re&s;toration, when, by a ma&s;ter-piece of cunning, he publi&s;hed in octavo, the arguments he had u&s;ed to prevale with his former ma&s;ter to mount the throne, under the title of MONARCHY <HI>a&s;&s;erted to be the be&s;t, the mo&s;t antient, and</HI>

<P>WHETHER this recommended him to the new government, or whether he had made his peace before, is not certain. He was received by <HI>Charles</HI> with di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of favor, who not only knighted him, but be&s;towed on him the honor of prime &s;er|jeant, and even created his elde&s;t &s;on a baronet.

<P>THE &s;tructure of the four principal &s;treets is without parallel.

<P>OF the four gates of the city,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EAST GATE, ROMAN.</NOTE> one of them, the <HI>Ea&s;t gate,</HI> continued till of late years; of <HI>Roman</HI> architecture, and con&s;i&s;t|ed of two arches, much hid by a tower, erected over it in the later days.

<P>THE gate in que&s;tion faced the great <HI>Watling &s;treet road,</HI> and near the place where other military ways united. Through this was the greate&s;t conflux of people; which rendered the u&s;e of the double portal more requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Roman</HI> bath beneath the <HI>Feathers Inn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HYPOCY</NOTE> in <HI>Bridge &s;treet,</HI> is probably &s;till entire; but the only part which can be &s;een, by rea&s;on of the more modern &s;uper&s;tructures, is the <HI>Hypocau&s;t.</HI> This is of a rectangular figure, &s;upported by thirty-two pillars, two feet ten inches and a half high, and about eighteen inches di&s;tant from each other. Upon each is a tile eighteen inches
<PB N="112" REF="133">
&s;quare, as if de&s;igned for a capital; and over them a perforated tile two feet &s;quare. Such are continued over all the pillars. Above the&s;e are two layers; one of coar&s;e mortar, mixed with &s;mall red gravel, about three inches thick; and the other of finer materials, between four and five inches thick: the&s;e &s;eem to have been the floor of the room above. The pillars &s;tand on a mortar-floor, &s;pread over the rock. On the &s;outh &s;ide, between the middle pillars, is the vent for the &s;moke, about &s;ix inches &s;quare, which is at pre&s;ent open to the height of &s;ixteen inches. Here is al&s;o an anti-chamber, exactly of the &s;ame extent with the <HI>Hypocau&s;t,</HI> with an opening in the middle into it. This is &s;unk near two feet below the level of the former, and is of the &s;ame rectangular figure; &s;o that both together are an exact &s;quare. This was the room allotted for the &s;laves who attended to heat the place; the other was the receptacle of the fuel de|&s;igned to heat the room above, the <HI>concamerata &s;udatio</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vitruvius,</HI> lib. v. c.

Such was the object of this Hypocau&s;t; for there were others of different forms, for the purpo&s;es of heating the waters de&s;tined for the u&s;e of the bathers.</P>
<P>I MUST now de&s;cend towards the bridge, in &s;earch of the few further reliques of the antient coloni&s;ts. After pa&s;&s;ing through the gate, on the right, near &s;ome &s;kinners hou&s;es, is a &s;mall flight of &s;teps, which lead to a large round arch, &s;eemingly of <HI>Roman</HI> workman&s;hip.

And immediately beyond, in the field called <HI>Ed|gar</HI>'s, are the ve&s;tiges of a road pointing up the hill;<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROMAN ROAD.</NOTE> and which we &s;hall have hereafter occa&s;ion to &s;ay, was continued toward <HI>bonium,</HI> the pre&s;ent <HI>Bangor.</HI></P>

<P>HAVING had occa&s;ion to mention the name of a departed an|tiquary, I think fit to acknowlege my obligations for the many hints I have benefitted by, from the travels of that great and lively genius; but at the &s;ame time lament, that I mu&s;t &s;ay, I often find him <HI>Plus beau que la</HI> VERITE. His rapid fancy led him too frequently to paint things as he thought they ought to be, not what they really were.

On the &s;ummit is a head included in a circular garland. I fogot to remark, that immediately over the in&s;cription is a globe overtopped with palm-leaves.

<P>THIS was found in digging for a cellar near the <HI>Ea&s;t-gate,</HI> on the antient pavement, which con&s;i&s;ted of great &s;tones.

<P>ON the re&s;toring of the <HI>Saxon</HI> line, it reverted, with the re&s;t of the <HI>Mercian</HI> province, to its old ma&s;ters. <HI>Leofric,</HI> a munifi|cent nobleman, was at that time governor of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and earl of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> The&s;e earls were not created, but merely official.

<P>ENGLAND now experienced a total change of ma&s;ters.

<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Lupus</HI> was firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, he began to exert his regal prerogatives. He formed his parlement by the crea|tion of eight barons, <HI>viz. Nigel</HI> baron of <HI>Halton; Robert,</HI> of <HI>Montalt; William Malbedeng</HI> baron of <HI>Nantwich; Vernon,</HI> of <HI>Shipbrook; Fitzhugh,</HI> of <HI>Malpas; Hamon de Ma&s;&s;ie Venables,</HI> of <HI>Kinderton;</HI> and <HI>Nicholas,</HI> of <HI>Stockport.</HI> The&s;e were to a&s;&s;i&s;t the earl with their advice: <HI>Ego comes</HI> HUGO <HI>et mei</HI> BARONES, was the form of his writs. They were obliged to pay him attend|ance, and to repair to his court to give it the greater dignity. They were bound, in time of war with <HI>Wales,</HI> to find for every knight's-fee a hor&s;e with capari&s;on and furniture, or two with|out furniture, in the divi&s;ion of <HI>Che&s;hire.</HI> Their knights and freeholders were to have cor&s;elets and habergeons, and were to defend their lands with their own bodies. Every baron had al&s;o four e&s;quires; every e&s;quire one gentleman; and every gen|tleman one valet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Erde&s;wicke</HI>'s MSS. quoted by Doctor <HI>Gower,</HI> p. 22.</NOTE>. Each of the&s;e barons had al&s;o their free courts of all pleas and &s;uits, and all plaints, except what be|longed to the earl's <HI>&s;word.</HI> They had be&s;ides power of life and death. The la&s;t in&s;tance of the exertion of this power was in the per&s;on of <HI>Hugh Stringer,</HI> who was tried for murder in the baron of <HI>Kinderton</HI>'s court, and executed in 1597<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Doctor <HI>Gower</HI>'s materials, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE earls had their chamberlain, which &s;upplied the place of chancellor; an office continued to this day. The fir&s;t we
<PB N="126" REF="147">
know of was <HI>Philippus Camerarius,</HI> who took his name from his office, in the time of <HI>Randle Gernouns</HI> earl of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> Here is a baron of the exchequer, and other officers conformable to tho&s;e of the crown at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter:</HI> al&s;o ju&s;tices, before whom the cau&s;es which of their nature &s;hould otherwi&s;e belong re&s;pectively to the courts of king's-bench and common-pleas, are triable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leice&s;ter, 152.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN imitation of regal power, the earls appointed a high con|&s;table of <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> corre&s;pondent to the high con&s;table of <HI>Eng|land;</HI> which was held in fee by the baron of <HI>Halton,</HI> who by virtue of this office took place of the other barons; and the baron of <HI>Montalt</HI> had precedency (after him) by virtue of his office in fee, of high &s;teward.</P>
<P>ROBERT DE ROTHELENT was another baron, who was com|mander in chief of the forces in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> and prime governor of the county under his cou&s;in <HI>Hugh Lupus.</HI> As his office and rank dropt with him, he is not reckoned among the barons. Probably the office was found unnece&s;&s;ary, and cla&s;hing with the priveleges of the high con&s;table.</P>
<P>THIS &s;pecies of government continued from the Conque&s;t till the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. a period of about 174 years; when, in 1237, on the death of <HI>John Scot</HI> (the &s;eventh earl of the <HI>Norman</HI> line) without i&s;&s;ue male, <HI>Henry</HI> took the earldom into his own hands, and gave the daughters of the late earl other lands in lieu; unwilling, as we &s;aid, that &s;o great an inheritance &s;hould <HI>be parcelled out among di&s;taffs.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE EARLDOM RESUMED BY THE CROWN.</NOTE> The king be&s;towed the coun|ty

<P>AFTER the re&s;umption of the earldom by the crown, the government of the city a&s;&s;umed a new form; for in the year 1242, the 26th of <HI>Henry</HI> III. it appears to have fir&s;t been under the directions of a mayor and &s;heriffs. The mayor &s;eems to have been the &s;ub&s;titute for the con&s;table; an office which, during the period of the <HI>Norman</HI> earls, was, under them, &s;upreme in all matters military and civil, in both city and county. The &s;heriffs &s;eem to have been a new name for bailiffs, who acted under the former<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vale royal, 161.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER giving a general idea of the &s;tate of this place and county to the time of <HI>Henry</HI> III. I &s;hall return to the time of <HI>Hugh Lupus,</HI> and give, to the be&s;t of my power, a brief chronolo|gical account of its hi&s;tory; leaving the eccle&s;ia&s;tical part to be treated apart.</P>
<P>IN the days of that potent earl, and probably long before he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this city, it enjoyed by pre&s;cription divers priveleges.<NOTE PLACE="marg">GUILD MIRCA|TORY.</NOTE> It had a <HI>guild mercatory</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 157.</NOTE>, analogous to a modern corporation; &s;o that no per&s;on who was not of that &s;ociety could exerci&s;e any trade or carry on any commerce within its pre|cinct. Such was the &s;tate in which the <HI>Normans</HI> found it; which the earls afterwards confirmed under their &s;eals.</P>
<P>Two over&s;eers, &s;elected out of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable citizens, were appointed to maintain the rights of this <HI>guild.</HI> They re|ceived,
<PB N="128" REF="149">
for the u&s;e of the city, all the cu&s;toms paid by &s;trangers, unle&s;s at the fairs, which in tho&s;e days were &s;aid to have been held three times in the year. The&s;e officers were probably of the &s;ame nature as the deans of <HI>guild</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI> It appears al&s;o from the Doom&s;day book, that here was a &s;upreme officer, called the <HI>Prape&s;itus Regis,</HI> or provo&s;t, who had the care both of the civil and commercial intere&s;ts.</P>

<P>IN this year the city was honored with the pre&s;ence of <HI>James</HI> I. where he was received with a magnificence that did honor to the place.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> The mayor. <HI>Edward Button,</HI> pre&s;ented his maje&s;ty with a fair &s;tanding cup, with a cover double gilt, and in it a hundred jacobins or gold.

The city did not confine its munificence to crowned heads; I find, that in 1583, <HI>Robert</HI> earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> chamberlain of the county palatine, met with a mo&s;t honorable reception; was received at the high-cro&s;s by the whole cor|poration, entertained by the mayor, and pre&s;ented with a cup containing forty angels.

He was pre|&s;ented with the like &s;um; but in a cup of the &s;ame kind as that which was afterwards pre&s;ented to <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>FROM 1617, I di&s;cover nothing very particular for a con&s;i|derable &s;pace; till the city was involved in the calamities of a &s;iege in 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">45-6, in con&s;equence of its un&s;haken loyalty to <HI>Charles</HI> I. At the beginning of the civil war, immediate attention was paid to this important city, by the royal party. The fortifications were put into the be&s;t repair, and outworks extended from the alcove on the north part of the walls, to the brink of the river near <HI>Boughton;</HI> and in con&s;equence, numbers of hou&s;es were pulled down, to prevent them from giving &s;helter to the enemy. The fir&s;t attempt made on the place by the parlement army was
<PB N="149" REF="170">
on the 20th of <HI>July</HI> 1643, when Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI> gave a violent a&s;&s;ault on the works; but met with a repul&s;e. In the &s;ame year he &s;ent a &s;ummons to Sir <HI>Abraham Shipman,</HI> then go|vernor, to &s;urrender: the gallant commander bid him come and win it and wear it.</P>
<P>AFTER the repul&s;e of Lord <HI>Biron</HI> before <HI>Namptwich,</HI> the county of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> was almo&s;t entirely in the hands of Sir <HI>Wil|liam Brereton,</HI> and the city &s;uffered from that time a &s;ort of blockade, from the quarters the enemy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the neighbor|hood, even as near as the village of <HI>Chri&s;tleton.</HI> Sallies and excur|&s;ions were frequently made; and, according to the diary of the &s;iege with advantage to the loyali&s;ts.</P>
<P>ON <HI>September</HI> the 19th 1645, the parlement gained an advan|tage irrecoverable by the be&s;ieged. Colonel <HI>Jones</HI> and adjutant-|general <HI>Lothian,</HI> who were employed in the reduction of <HI>Bee&s;ton</HI> ca&s;tle, drew from before that place, in a &s;ecret manner, a large body of forces, and in the night &s;tormed the outworks, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of every thing, even to the city walls. His maje&s;ty, immediately after this misfortune, pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Wales,</HI> and got into the city, in hopes of animating the garri&s;on, and was lodged at Sir <HI>Francis Gamul</HI>'s, near the bridge. He ar|rived only time enough to be a &s;pectator, from the leads of the <HI>Phoenix</HI> tower, of the fatal battle on <HI>Rowton</HI> heath, on <HI>September</HI> 24; when his forces, under Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> then on their march to rai&s;e the &s;iege, after a well-di&s;puted action, &s;unk under the &s;uperior fortune of general <HI>Pointz.</HI></P>
<P>THE king continued that night in <HI>Che&s;ter;</HI> and on quitting it the next day, gave orders to the governor, lord <HI>Biron,</HI> that
<PB N="150" REF="171">
in ca&s;e there was no appearance of relief within eight days, he was to treat of a &s;urrender. The king took the route of <HI>Den-|high,</HI> attended to that town by the three re&s;pectable citizens, Sir <HI>Francis Gamul,</HI> alderman <HI>Cooper,</HI> and captain <HI>Thropp.</HI> The &s;iege was continued with the utmo&s;t vigour by Sir <HI>William Brereton;</HI> notwith&s;tanding which, the gallant garri&s;on held out for twenty weeks, beyond the expectation of every body: and, after having been reduced to live on hor&s;es, dogs, and cats, yielded, on the 3d of <HI>February</HI> 1645-6, on terms that did honor to the &s;pirit of the be&s;ieged. The city was evacuated by the royali&s;ts; and received from the parlement, as governor, colonel <HI>Jones.</HI> But the mi&s;eries of the citizens did not terminate with the &s;iege: a dreadful pe&s;tilence broke out in 1647: two thou&s;and inhabi|tants peri&s;hed, and the city became almo&s;t a de&s;ert.</P>
<P>IN order to give a further hi&s;tory of the military,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BRIDGE.</NOTE> civil, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical architecture of this antient city, I return to the bridge. This pa&s;&s;age was prior to the Conque&s;t; at which pe|riod it &s;eems to have been either de&s;troyed, or found to be &s;o much out of repair, that I find in <HI>Doom&s;day book</HI> an or|der for the provo&s;t to &s;ummon one man from each hide of land in the county, in order to re-build the bridge and the walls; and, in ca&s;e of neglect of appearance, the lord of the per|&s;on &s;o &s;ummoned was to forfeit to the king and earl forty &s;hillings.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to a MS. quoted by Mr. <HI>Gro&s;e,</HI> it was begun by the great re&s;torer of the city, <HI>Ethelfieda,</HI> and after her death completed by her brother <HI>Edward.</HI> Before that time, the pa&s;|&s;age was by a ferry that plied between the po&s;tern, called the
<PB N="151" REF="172">
<HI>Ship-gate,</HI> and <HI>Edgar</HI>'s field. It does not appear to me that any part of the <HI>Saxon</HI> bridge remains; &s;o frequently has it been re|paired &s;ince that di&s;tant period.</P>
<P>BENEATH the arch next to the city,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAUSEWAY AND MILLS.</NOTE> is a current, which, by means of a great dam or cau&s;eway that cro&s;&s;es the river obliquely, &s;upplies the city mills with water. The&s;e mills and the cau&s;e|way were originally founded by <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harleian</HI> MSS. 2082. 10. 2003. 41. 43.</NOTE>, and retained by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and afterwards by the earls of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> of the royal line. I find them often lea&s;ed by the crown; <HI>Edward</HI> the black prince, in particular, in 1355, grants them, the fi&s;hing, &s;uit, court, and cal&s;ey, for three years, to <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Bredone,</HI> par&s;on of St. <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and others, at the annual rent of 190 <HI>l.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem, 2081. 21.</NOTE>. This rent was very con&s;iderable in tho&s;e days; and aro&s;e from the obligation every inhabitant of the city then lay under to grind at the&s;e mills, excepting the tenants of the abbot and monks of St. <HI>Werburgh,</HI> and, in after times, tho&s;e of the dean and chapter, inhabiting without the <HI>North-gate,</HI> who had a mill of their own at <HI>Bachpool.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST not omit, that a grant of the&s;e mills for life was the reward of valor to my countryman Sir <HI>Howel y Fwyall,</HI> for his bravery in taking pri&s;oner <HI>John</HI> king of <HI>France,</HI> in the battle of <HI>Poitiers.</HI> This grant was al&s;o made by the black prince, who not only knighted <HI>Howel,</HI> but allowed a me&s;s of meat to be &s;erved before his battle ax, in memory of the good u&s;e he made of it in that day; from which he acquired the name of <HI>Fwyall,</HI> or <HI>Howei</HI> or the ax<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. <HI>Gwedir</HI> family.

<P>THIS and the other city gates were placed under the pro|tection of certain great men, who held lands within the county palatine. The earl of <HI>Shrew&s;hury</HI> had the care of the <HI>Bridge-|gate;</HI> the earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> of the <HI>Ea&s;t-gate;</HI> the earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> of the <HI>Water-gate.</HI> But the <HI>North-gate,</HI> belonging peculiarly to the city, was intru&s;ted only to its chief magi&s;trates.

guard; and, notwith&s;tanding the cau&s;e has long &s;ince cea&s;ed, are &s;till demanded at the <HI>Bridge-gate.</HI></P>
<P>ABOVE the gate is a lofty octagonal tower,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WATER-WORKS.</NOTE> begun in 1600, by permi&s;&s;ion of the corporation, by <HI>John Tyrer</HI> of this city, containing the works which for a long time rai&s;ed water out of the <HI>Dee</HI> to a ci&s;tern in the top, whence it was conveyed in pipes to almo&s;t all parts of the city. Po&s;&s;ibly the&s;e did not an&s;wer their purpo&s;e effectually; for in 1622, <HI>Tyrer</HI> had a new grant of a tower erected for a water-work and a well-place, ten feet &s;quare, near <HI>Spittle Boughton,</HI> with full powers for the conveyance of the water to the ci&s;tern or conduit near the high-cro&s;s. This work (which was fir&s;t begun by the <HI>black friers</HI> in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> I.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De aquaeductu per ip&s;os (the black friers) faciendo a fonte prope furcas. Vide <HI>Tanner,</HI> 65.</NOTE>) fell to decay. In 1692, the works undertaken by <HI>Tyrer</HI> being found to be ruinous and u&s;ele&s;s, <HI>John Hopkins</HI> and <HI>John Hadley,</HI> by the encouragement of the corporation, began new works for &s;upplying the city with water from the river <HI>Dee:</HI> for this purpo&s;e, they purcha&s;ed the grant made to <HI>Tyrer,</HI> and al&s;o one of the corn-mills, for the conveniency of placing their engine. The city confirmed to them all the powers formerly ve&s;ted in <HI>Tyrer,</HI> and particularly that of &s;etting up a ci&s;tern oppo&s;ite to the abby court, as a con&s;tant receptacle for fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>NEAR the <HI>Bridge-gate</HI> is one a&s;cent to the city walls;<NOTE PLACE="marg">WALLS.</NOTE> which are the only entire &s;pecimen of antient fortification now in <HI>Great Britain.</HI> They are a mile and three quarters, and a hun|dred

and one yards in circumference; and, being the principal walk of the inhabitants, are kept in excellent repair, by certain impo&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MURRACE</NOTE> called murage duties, collected at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, upon all goods and merchandize brought into the port of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> from parts beyond the &s;eas, belonging to per&s;ons not freemen of the city. The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> linen adds con&s;iderably to the fund, be|ing nearly two-thirds of the whole: the duty on this article is two pence on every hundred yards. The annual receipt of the different duties, on the average of the la&s;t &s;even years, is about 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0<HI>l..</HI> An officer, called a murenger, is cho&s;en out of the body of the aldermen, to in&s;pect the repairs; generally an old member, to whom the duty affords amu&s;ement and health. This fund is now permanent: in old times, the murage was only occa&s;ional. Thus, in the 14th of <HI>Edward</HI> II. there was a grant for two years of a half-penny for every cranock of corn; and a farthing of ale, meal, and malt; and for commodities not expre&s;&s;ed in the grant, a farthing out of every two &s;hillings-worth.</P>
<P>I CANNOT di&s;cover any ve&s;tige of the original walls, &s;uch as tho&s;e which are &s;aid to have been re&s;tored by the warlike <HI>Ethelfleda.</HI> I would not willingly detract from the lady's merit; but I mu&s;t deny her that of being the foundre&s;s of the forti|fications, and of enlarging the city beyond the <HI>Roman</HI> precincts. The form at pre&s;ent is &s;o entirely <HI>Roman,</HI> that any addition &s;he could make would have de&s;troyed the peculiar figure that wi&s;e people always pre&s;erved in their &s;tations or ca&s;trametations, where|&s;oever the nature of the ground would permit. The antiquities which di&s;tingui&s;h their re&s;idence are not found confined to any one quarter: they are met in digging on every &s;ide within the walls.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="176">THE military architecture is &s;till entirely on the <HI>Roman</HI> plan; it is probable, that after their retreat it fell into ruin, in the empoveri&s;hed, turbulent, and barbarous ages that &s;ucceeded, yet never was &s;o totally demoli&s;hed, but that it might &s;till yield a defence to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.

<P>AT the extreme angle of the city, beyond this gate, is a &s;alient tower, exactly round,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WATER-TOWER.</NOTE> unle&s;s where interrupted by a &s;mall &s;quared projection at the entrance. This tower is joined to the walls by a deep open gallery, embattled on each &s;ide, beneath is a large arch for the pa&s;&s;age of the tide, before the late inclo|&s;ures, which al&s;o are within my remembrance. This tower is at pre&s;ent called the <HI>Water-tower.</HI> It jutted into the antient chan|nel or the river, where the &s;hips lay, which fa&s;tened their cables

to its &s;ides by the great iron rings infixed in the &s;tone. This tower was formerly called the new; yet was founded in 1320; for there exi&s;ts a contract for that purpo&s;e, between the mayor and citizens of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> and one <HI>John de Help&s;ton,</HI> ma&s;on, for building <HI>quandam turrem rotundum,</HI> &amp;c. a round tower <Q>of the thickne&s;s of ten yards and a half, with a cavity within; twenty-four yards high, and &s;o &s;trong as to be defen&s;ible;</Q> and all this for the &s;um of one hundred pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harleian MSS.

<P>THE next remarkable outlet is the <HI>North-gate,</HI> beyond which is a large &s;uburb.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Phoenix</HI> tower &s;tands on the angle of the walls beyond this gate. The pre&s;ent tower was built in 1613, and was u&s;ed by &s;ix of the companies of the city as a chamber for bu&s;ine&s;s. It took its name from the fabulous bird, the cre&s;t of the painter-&s;tainers company, which was placed in front.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ea&s;t-gate</HI> is the next entrance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">EAST-GATE.</NOTE> Here &s;tood a lofty &s;quare tower, with many apartments, erected (according to tradi|tion) by <HI>Edward</HI> III. This had been a <HI>Porta principalis,</HI> was the grand entrance into the town, and was the termination of the great <HI>Watling-&s;treet</HI> road, which cro&s;&s;ed the i&s;land from <HI>Dover,</HI> and was the great road from that port to this place. In 1769, this gate, being found too narrow and inconvenient, was pulled down, and a magnificent arch aro&s;e in its room, at the &s;ole ex|pence of <HI>Richard</HI> lord <HI>Gro&s;venour.</HI> Beyond this is a va&s;t &s;ub|urb, called the <HI>Fore&s;t-&s;treet;</HI> who&s;e lower part was defended by a gate, demoli&s;hed as a nu&s;ance within the&s;e few years.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="179">AFTER pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Ea&s;t-gate,</HI> the traveller will ob&s;erve, without the walls, a va&s;t fo&s;s cut through the live rock, now a common road to the water; but which appears to me to have been a work of the <HI>Romans,</HI> as a defence on this &s;ide, and which con|tinues the rectangular &s;hape of the &s;tation.</P>

<P>ON the Conque&s;t, as has been before related, the king vi&s;ited this city in per&s;on, and re&s;tored the fortifications, It is probable that he only repaired the walls, but that he entirely re-built the ca&s;tle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ordericus Vitalis, 516.</NOTE> on the <HI>Norman</HI> model, and en|larged it far beyond the dimen&s;ions of that of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> which occupied the &s;ummit of the mount or little hill on which the fortre&s;s &s;tands. That part is artificial, in order to give a great elevation, as was cu&s;tomary in the <HI>Saxon</HI> keeps; and the portion &s;o flung up appears here to have been a mixture of &s;tones and exceedingly hard clay.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;tle is compo&s;ed of two parts, an upper and a lower: each with a &s;trong gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> defended by a round ba&s;tion on each &s;ide, with a ditch, and formerly with draw-bridges. Within the precincts of the upper <HI>Ballium</HI> are to be &s;een &s;ome towers of <HI>Norman</HI> architecture, &s;quare, with &s;quare projections at each
<PB N="159" REF="180">
corner, very &s;lightly &s;alient. The hand&s;ome&s;t is that called <HI>Ju|lius Cae&s;ar</HI>'s. Its entrance is through a large Gothic door, pro|bably of later workman&s;hip. The lowe&s;t room has a vaulted roof, &s;trengthened with ordinary &s;quare couples. The upper had been a chapel, as appears by the holy-water pot, and &s;ome figures, almo&s;t ob&s;olete, painted on the walls. Its dimen&s;ions are nineteen feet four inches, by &s;ixteen &s;ix, the height al&s;o &s;ix|teen feet &s;ix. The roof is vaulted; but the couples, which are rounded, &s;lender, and elegant, run down the walls, and re&s;t on the cornuted capitals of five &s;hort but beautiful round pillars, in the &s;ame &s;tyle with tho&s;e in the chapter-hou&s;e of the cathe|dral; probably the work of the &s;ame architect. The ar&s;enal, &s;ome batteries, and certain habitable buildings, occupy the re|maining part.</P>
<P>ON the &s;ides of the lower court &s;tands the noble room called <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI>'s hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LUPUS'S HALL.</NOTE> in which the courts of ju&s;tice for the county are held. The length is very near ninety-nine feet; the breadth forty-five; the height very aweful, and worthy the &s;tate-apartment of a great baron. The roof &s;upported by wood|work, in a bold &s;tyle, carved; and placed on the &s;ides, re&s;ting on &s;tout brackets.</P>
<P>THIS magnificent building probably retains its original dimen|&s;ions. The character of the fir&s;t <HI>Norman</HI> earl required a hall &s;uited to the greatne&s;s of his ho&s;pitality; which was confined to no bounds. 'He was,' &s;ays <HI>Ordericus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib, iv. p 522.</NOTE>, <Q>not only liberal, but pro&s;u&s;e. He did not carry a family with him, but an army.
<PB N="160" REF="181">
He kept no account of receits or di&s;bur&s;ements. He was per|petually wa&s;ting his e&s;tates: and was much fonder of falconers and hunt&s;men, than of cultivators of the land and holy men: and by his gluttony he grew &s;o exce&s;&s;ively fat, that he could hardly crawl about.</Q></P>
<P>ADJOINING to the end of this great hall is the court of ex|chequer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXCHEQUER</NOTE> or the chancery of the county palatine of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> The earl of <HI>Cholmondely</HI> is the pre&s;ent chamberlain; Sir <HI>Richard Perrin,</HI> my worthy countryman, &s;its and di&s;charges the office of vice-chamberlain. In re&s;pect to matters of equity, he here acts as lord chancellor. The chamberlain was one of the an|tient earl's great officers, and had a fee of twenty-two pounds a year. This very building is &s;aid to have been the parlement|hou&s;e of the little kings of the palatinate. It &s;avors of anti|quity in the architecture; and within are a number of &s;eats de&s;cribed by Gothic arches and neat pillars; at the upper end are two; one for the earl, the other for the abbot. The eight others were allotted to his eight barons, [and occupy one &s;ide of the room.</P>
<P>UNDER the vice-chamberlain is a baron, who holds a weekly court, in which appearances are entered for bringing cau&s;es to a trial. Writs and &s;ubpoenas are al&s;o here made out, as well for the great &s;e&s;&s;ions for this county, as for tho&s;e of the county of <HI>Flint.</HI> Here is, be&s;ides, an examiner; and a &s;eal-keeper, who has the charge of the records.</P>
<P>THE judges have lodgings within the ca&s;tle, during their circuit, by antient cu&s;tom. The&s;e are furni&s;hed by the &s;heriffs of the city. The &s;heriffs of the county take care of their hor&s;es; but
<PB N="161" REF="182">
are allowed the expences when they bring in their accounts at the audit.</P>
<P>THE county jail for felons and debtors is the la&s;t place to be de&s;cribed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">JAIL</NOTE> I can do little more than confirm the account of it by the humane <HI>Howard.</HI> Their day-confinement is in a little yard, &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by lofty buildings, imper|vious to the air, excepting from above, and ever unvi&s;ited by the purifying rays of the &s;un. Their nocturnal apartments are in cells &s;even feet and a half by three and a half; ranged on one &s;ide of a &s;ubterraneous dungeon; in each of which are often lodged three or four per&s;ons. The whole is rendered more (whole&s;omely) horrible, by being pitched over three or four times in the year. The &s;canty air of their &s;treight pri&s;on-yard is to travel through three pa&s;&s;ages to arrive at them: through the window of an adjacent room; through a grate in the floor of the &s;aid room into the dungeon; and finally, through the dungeon, through a little grate above the door of each of their kennels. In &s;uch places as the&s;e are the innocent and the guilty permitted to be lodged, till the law decides their fate. I am &s;ure the humane keeper, Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> mu&s;t feel many a pang at the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;charge of his duty. Mr. HOWARD compares the place to the black-hole at <HI>Calcutta.</HI> The view I had of it, a&s;&s;i&s;ted to rai&s;e the idea of a much wor&s;e pri&s;on where</P>

<P>WITHIN the walls of this fortre&s;s, was an in&s;tance of a felon &s;uffering <HI>pri&s;on forte et dure,</HI> for &s;tanding mute on his trial, till he died of hunger.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRISON FORTE IT DURE.</NOTE> One <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;on of <HI>John,</HI> of the <HI>Woodhou&s;es,</HI> was, in 1310, the 4th of <HI>Edward</HI> II. committed for burning his own hou&s;es, and carrying away the goods.

This was the origin of the puni&s;hment of pre&s;&s;ing to death, or the <HI>peine forte et dure,</HI> which &s;eems a &s;ort of merciful ha&s;tening of death; for it mu&s;t have been much more horrible, as well as tedious, in the manner pre&s;cribed by the law of the fir&s;t <HI>Edward,</HI> in who&s;e reign it ori|ginated.

<P>THE term <HI>ad dietam</HI> was ironical, expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ad &s;u&s;te|nance the &s;ufferer was allowed; <HI>viz.</HI> on the fir&s;t day, three mor&s;els of the wor&s;t bread; on the &s;econd, three draughts of water out of the next puddle: and this was to be alternately his daily diet till he died.</P>
<P>MR. RYMER records a &s;trange in&s;tance of a woman at <HI>Not|tingham,</HI> who underwent this puni&s;hment, and lived forty days
<PB N="163" REF="184">
without meat or drink. This happened in 1357, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. who, <Q>ad laudem Dei et glorio&s;ae virginis MA|RLAe matris &s;uae, unde dictum miraculum proce&s;&s;it, <HI>at credi|tur</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The woman's name was <HI>Caecilia,</HI> indicted for the murder of her hu&s;band, <HI>John de Rygeway, Rymer</HI>'s Foedera, vi. 13.</NOTE>,</Q> granted the &s;ufferer a free pardon. After mentioning, that it is probable that the miracle was a little a&s;&s;i&s;ted by natural means, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that, according to this in&s;tance, the con|demned were, in &s;ome ca&s;es, ab&s;olutely denied any &s;pecies of food; in others, it &s;eems probable, from the name of the pu|ni&s;hment of <HI>Adam,</HI> that they &s;ometimes were allowed that wretched diet which was continued when the puni&s;hment changed into the <HI>peine dure et forte.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is a &s;ingularity in the manner of the treatment of the pri&s;oners who are relea&s;ed by capital puni&s;hment out of their dreadful cells, which merits mention. They are delivered by the con&s;table or his deputy, at a &s;tone called <HI>Glover's-&s;tone,</HI> about ninety yards di&s;tant from the outward gate, into the hands of the &s;heriffs of the city; who receive them at that &s;tone, which is the extreme limit of the ca&s;tle precincts, and from thence convey them to the place of execution, which they al&s;o have the charge of. This cu&s;tom is not accounted for, any more than by tradition, that a felon was formerly re&s;cued in his way to the gallows by the citizens of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and perhaps by the connivance of the magi&s;trates, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to have had the di&s;agreeable duty inflicted on them of executing all criminals, whether they are of the county or the city.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="185">THE city was &s;eparated from the ca&s;tle, and made a county of it&s;elf, by the charter of <HI>Henry</HI> VII: the ca&s;tle was left as an ap|pertance to the &s;hire; and has the &s;mall outlet of a little &s;treet called <HI>Glover's-&s;tone,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GLOVER'S STONE.</NOTE> which is al&s;o independent of the city; and in which non-freemen may &s;et up any trade unmole&s;ted by the corporation.</P>

<P>I IMAGINE that this building,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRAETORIUM.</NOTE> St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s church, and a few hou&s;es to the north and we&s;t, occupy the &s;ite of the <HI>Roman Prae|torium;</HI> for they not only fill the very &s;ituation of that part of the old ca&s;trametations, but account for the di&s;continuance of the <HI>Bridge &s;treet,</HI> which cea&s;es oppo&s;ite to the&s;e edifices.

<PB N="169" REF="190">
points directly towards the former; but is interrupted by the &s;pace occupied by the&s;e buildings. The limit of the <HI>Praetorium</HI> on the ea&s;t, was the narrow portion of <HI>North-gate &s;treet;</HI> on the &s;outh, part of the pre&s;ent <HI>Bridge, Ea&s;t-gate,</HI> and <HI>Water-gate &s;treets;</HI> on the we&s;t <HI>Go&s;s lane;</HI> and on the north, the &s;pace now occupied by the fi&s;h-market. The <HI>praetorium,</HI> with its attendants, de|manded no &s;mall &s;pace; for, be&s;ides the &s;pot po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the general, were the apartments of the <HI>imperatoris contubernales,</HI> or the young nobility immediately under his care; the <HI>augurale,</HI> where prayers, &s;acrifices, and other religious rites were performed, which might have &s;tood on the &s;ite of the modern church; and the general might have had his tribunal on the very &s;pot where the wor&s;hipful corporation at pre&s;ent &s;it for the redre&s;s of grievances.</P>
<P>THE courts of ju&s;tice are held in the common hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXCHANGE.</NOTE> a large and commodious room over the exchange, adorned with the portraits of &s;everal popular per&s;ons: among them is a full-length of Sir <HI>William Williams,</HI> recorder of this city, &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of commons in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. and &s;olicitor-general in that of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. In this place are held a crown-mote court, portmote court, and court of &s;e&s;&s;ions. The mayor, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the recorder, is judge of the crownmote court.

<P>THE only remains of any <HI>hotel,</HI> and that of no antient date, &s;tood in <HI>Old Common-ball lane;</HI> which, when entire, &s;urrounded a &s;quare, and communicated with <HI>Water-gate &s;treet.</HI> It was founded by Sir <HI>Thomas Egerton,</HI> chamberlain of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> afterwards lord chan|cellor of <HI>England,</HI> and de&s;igned by him for a dwelling-hou&s;e. The &s;mall remainder, which faced the lane, and was occupied by a poor family, on the 5th of <HI>November</HI> 1772, was the &s;cene of a dreadful calamity. The fir&s;t floor was engaged by a puppet-&s;how man; and at the moment he was exhibiting to a very full audience, by &s;ome unknown accident 800 pounds weight of gunpowder, which was lodged in a warehou&s;e beneath, took fire, and blew up three &s;tories. Twenty-three people pe|ri&s;hed, and eighty-three were much burnt, brui&s;ed, and received broken and di&s;located limbs; of which number only three died, and tho&s;e with locked jaws. The remedy found mo&s;t efficacious for the burnt, was <HI>Goulard</HI>'s extract of lead.</P>
<P>THE external effects of this explo&s;ion were the&s;e: the win|dows and broken gla&s;s of &s;everal of the neighboring hou&s;es fell outwards; from which it appears, that they were not broken by the &s;hock of the gunpowder, but by the pre&s;&s;ure of the air within the apartments, which ru&s;hed out into the <HI>vacuum</HI> oc|ca&s;ioned by the explo&s;ion. A &s;imilar phaenomenon has been remarked from an explo&s;ion from the inflammable vapor of a mine, when the neighboring trees fell towards the bla&s;t. How&s;o|ever,
<PB N="171" REF="192">
where the force of the powder was confined by narrow pa&s;&s;ages, its centrifugal effect took place; for two boys, walk|ing along the rows in <HI>Water-gate &s;treet,</HI> oppo&s;ite to a pa&s;&s;age leading to the building, were blown, one again&s;t the rails, the other into the &s;treet; and the roof of a hou&s;e was blown off, op|po&s;ite a pa&s;&s;age into <HI>Common-hall lane.</HI></P>
<P>IT is much to be wi&s;hed, that the ea&s;y magi&s;tracy of this city would, from this dire accident, take into con&s;ideration the &s;afety of the whole, in preference to the conveniency of a few lazy individuals; and either compel them to keep by them only the legal quantity, or at their &s;e&s;&s;ion appoint proper places for lodging gunpowder. This is the &s;econd tremendous warning of the &s;ame nature which the city hath been vi&s;ited with. On the fir&s;t of <HI>April</HI> 1726, the &s;hop of Mr. <HI>Thomas Murray</HI> in <HI>Bridge &s;treet,</HI> and the hou&s;e, were blown up; and him&s;elf and a young gentleman killed. Notwith&s;tanding this double admoni|tion, I fear its attention &s;till continues lethargic.</P>
<P>THE &s;urviving &s;ufferers of this calamity were relieved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">630 <HI>l.</HI> was al&s;o immediately collected from the humane inhabitants of the city, to be di&s;tributed among the&s;e mi&s;erable maimed objects.</NOTE> in the well-regulated infirmary e&s;tabli&s;hed here, and &s;upported by the voluntary contributions from the city, county, and neigh|boring parts of <HI>Wales.</HI> It is a hand&s;ome building, in an airy &s;ituation, and detached from the &s;treets. This charity was founded in 1756, and originated from a beque&s;t of 300 <HI>l.</HI> left by Dr. <HI>Stratford,</HI> commi&s;&s;ary of <HI>Richmond,</HI> towards the com|mencing of a public ho&s;pital in this city. Sub&s;criptions were
<PB N="172" REF="193">
circulated, and a &s;um equal to the de&s;ign &s;oon rai&s;ed. Before the pre&s;ent building could be ready for the reception of patients, a temporary infirmary was prepared for them, in 1756, in <HI>North|gate &s;treet.</HI> The new infirmary was opened on the 17th of <HI>March</HI> 1761; and has been &s;upported with a &s;pirit that does honor to the environs; which has enabled the managers to receive, &s;ince its in&s;titution, not fewer than thirteen thou&s;and &s;ix hun|dred and thirty-&s;ix objects of relief. The portrait of the founder is placed in the council-room of the infirmary; a three-quarters piece, &s;itting, in a long wig and civilian's gown.</P>
<P>I SHALL now take a &s;hort view of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate of this antient city. It is nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Mercian</HI> kingdom was divided into five bi&s;hopricks; <HI>Lichfield, Che&s;ter, Worce&s;ter, Lydnece&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Dorche&s;ter;</HI> which la&s;t was afterwards removed to <HI>Lincoln. Lichfield</HI> was made, about the year 785, metropolitan, by order of <HI>Offa,</HI> and afterwards, for a long &s;pace, incorporated into it&s;elf its &s;uffragan, <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> How greatly the la&s;t flouri&s;hed is evident from an account of its annual payment to the pope in very early times; for, when <HI>Lichfield</HI> payed only three thou&s;and florins, our &s;ee advanced five thou&s;and. No wonder that its jealou&s;y &s;hould be excited! Very little is known of the &s;tate of this church in the <HI>Saxon</HI> period. Let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that a bi&s;hop of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> of the name of <HI>Peter,</HI> in the year 1075, removed his epi&s;copal &s;eat to <HI>Che&s;ter;</HI> and during his life made u&s;e of the church of St. <HI>John</HI>'s for his cathedral. This tran&s;lation was of very &s;hort date; for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf in the former dioce&s;e, and <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> continued without a bi&s;hop till the di&s;&s;olution of mona&s;teries; when, in 1541,
<PB N="173" REF="194">
<HI>Henry</HI> VIII. re&s;tored it to its former honor, by creating it one of the &s;ix<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We&s;tmin&s;ter, Oxford, Bri&s;tol, Glo&s;ter, Peterborough, <HI>and</HI> Che&s;ter. <HI>The fir&s;t was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in the reign of queen</HI> Mary.</NOTE> new &s;ees formed on that great event; and converted the church of the late abby of St. <HI>Werburgh</HI> into the ca|thedral.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the new bi&s;hops was <HI>John Bird,</HI> a <HI>Carmelite,</HI> and provincial of the order; a man &s;ub&s;ervient to the court; who, by preaching again&s;t the pope's &s;upremacy, &s;o recom|mended him&s;elf to the king as to obtain the bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Bangor;</HI> from whence he was removed to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> as a fit per|&s;on to &s;uit the rapacity of the times. In 1546, he granted away the whole of the manors and deme&s;nes of the &s;ee, and, accepting impropriation in&s;tead of them, left his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors not a &s;ingle acre, excepting that on which the palace &s;tands, and the court before it; another hou&s;e, adjacent; a little orchard called the <HI>Woodyard;</HI> two hou&s;es near St. <HI>John</HI>'s church; and a few &s;mall tenements in the city of <HI>York.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding the &s;um he ama&s;&s;ed, he was found, at the acce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Mary,</HI> in debt to the crown 1087 <HI>l.</HI> 18 <HI>s.</HI> for tenths and &s;ub&s;idies; a va&s;t &s;um for the times! His intere&s;t with bi&s;hop <HI>Bonner</HI> &s;till would have &s;aved him, had he not committed (in tho&s;e days) the heinous crime of matrimony, for which he was deprived in 1554.</P>

<P>THE abby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ABBY.</NOTE> out of which this &s;ee was formed, was of great antiquity. Hi&s;tory relates, that it had been originally a nunnery, founded about the year 660, by <HI>Wulpherus,</HI> king of the <HI>Mer|cians,</HI> in favor of his daughter's indi&s;po&s;ition to a married life. This was the celebrated St. <HI>Werburgh,</HI> who took the veil after living immaculate for three years with her hu&s;band <HI>Ceolredus,</HI> after the example of her aunt, the great <HI>Ethelreda;</HI> who coha|bited for three years with no le&s;s purity with her fir&s;t &s;pou&s;e <HI>Tonberctus,</HI> and for twelve with her &s;econd, the pious prince <HI>Eg|frid.</HI> St. <HI>Werburgh</HI> pre&s;ided over &s;everal <HI>Mercian</HI> mona&s;teries, died at <HI>Tricengham,</HI> and by her own order was interred at <HI>Heanburge;</HI> but on the approach of the <HI>Danes,</HI> in 875, her body was con|veyed to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> as a place of &s;ecurity from the in&s;ults of tho&s;e pagans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hiden <HI>in</HI> Gale, iii. 240.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is uncertain how long this community exi&s;ted. It probably was ruined by the ravages of the barbarians in 895, and finally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; for we are told<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, that from the reign of king <HI>Athel&s;tan,</HI> in 925, to the coming of the <HI>Normans,</HI> a &s;et of canons &s;ecular were e&s;tabli&s;hed in the place of the nuns. This pious deed was that of <HI>Ethel&s;leda;</HI> who re&s;tored the buildings; which afterwards were repaired by earl <HI>Leofric,</HI> hu&s;band to the famous <HI>Go|diva.</HI> The hou&s;e was richly endowed by the kings <HI>Edmund</HI> and

<HI>Edgar,</HI> and by <HI>Leofric. Edgar</HI>'s charter begins in a &s;train equally pious and &s;ublime<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale,</HI> Mona&s;t. i. 200.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ON the acce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> to this earldom, he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the canons &s;ecular, and e&s;tabli&s;hed in their place a colony of his countrymen, <HI>Benedictines,</HI> from <HI>Bec</HI> in <HI>Normandy;</HI> for pro|bably he did not care to tru&s;t his &s;alvation to the prayers of the <HI>Saxon</HI> religious. It is &s;aid, that this piece of piety was owing to a fit of illne&s;s which the earl was &s;eized with; when he took the u&s;ual way in tho&s;e days of &s;oothing a troubled con&s;cience. <HI>An&s;elm,</HI> abbot of <HI>Bec,</HI> and afterwards archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> regulated the new foundation; and appointed his chaplain <HI>Richard</HI> to be the fir&s;t abbot. <HI>Lupus</HI> and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors were very liberal in their endowments<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem, 985, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>; and the place flou|ri&s;hed till its di&s;&s;olution; which was effected by the &s;urrender of the la&s;t abbot, <HI>Thomas Clerk;</HI> who received in reward the of|fice of the new deanry, which he enjoyed only &s;ix weeks. The revenues of this great abby were, according to <HI>Dugdale,</HI> 1003 <HI>l.</HI> 5 <HI>s.</HI> II <HI>d.</HI> to Speed, 1073 <HI>l.</HI> 17 <HI>s.</HI> 7 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>ACCORDING to a &s;urvey of this abby, pre&s;erved in the <HI>Harleian</HI> collection, its extent was very con&s;iderable; &s;urrounding the pre&s;ent &s;quare, and covering &s;everal parts of the adjacent ground. The old abby-court is adorned on two &s;ides by very hand&s;ome modern hou&s;es, built between the years 1750 and 1754, on lea&s;es granted by the dean and chapter.

<P>THE beautiful edifice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAPTER-HOUSE.</NOTE> the chapter-hou&s;e, &s;tands in the &s;ame walk, of the cloi&s;ter. The ve&s;tibule is arched, &s;upported by four columns, each &s;urrounded with eight &s;lender pila&s;ters with|out capitals, which converge near the top of the column, and &s;pread over the roof. The dimen&s;ions of this room are thirty-|three feet four inches, by twenty-&s;even four; the height twelve feet nine. On the &s;ides is a &s;tone-feat for the attendants on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the chapter.</P>
<P>THE chapter-hou&s;e is fifty feet long, twenty-&s;ix feet broad, end thirty-five feet high; at the upper end is a window, con|&s;i&s;ting of five lancet-&s;haped divi&s;ions; and on each &s;ide is ano|ther of three. At the height of eight feet and a half from the floor, a narrow gallery runs along three parts of the room, divided from the windows by a triplet of mo&s;t elegant, lofty, &s;lender pillars. The roof is of &s;tone; the &s;prings of the arches which &s;ecure it, are &s;upported by neat pila&s;ters with palmy capitals.</P>
<P>THE modern book-ca&s;es deform the lower parts of the room, as high as the bottoms of the windows. The walls, 1 conjecture, had been ornamented with pila&s;ters, and had a &s;tone-&s;eat like that of the ve&s;tibule. The entrance, both from the cloi&s;ters and between the ve&s;tibule and the chapter-hou&s;e, are Gothic; but apparently of a later &s;pecies of architecture than either of tho&s;e rooms.</P>
<P>THE chapter-hou&s;e was built, in all probability, in the time of <HI>Rendle the fir&s;t,</HI> earl of <HI>Che&s;ler,</HI> who died in 1128, after en|joying

his earldom eight years. The great earl, <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> uncle to <HI>Randle,</HI> had been interred in the church-yard of the abby: the fir&s;t care of the nephew was to remove the body into this building<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leice&s;ter's Hi&s;t.</HI> Antiq. 127.</NOTE>, as the mo&s;t honorable place; a re&s;pect which would certainly have been payed to it, had this edifice exi&s;ted at the time of his death.

Other coffins were di&s;covered beneath the two rooms, of earls, their counte&s;&s;es, or of abbots; but the great leveller death had reduced them to du&s;t indi&s;tingui&s;hable.</P>

<P>THE church bounds the north &s;ide of the cloi&s;ters.

I beg leave to di&s;&s;ent from the notion of this having been the &s;hrine of St. <HI>Werbugh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. WERBURCH'S SHRINE</NOTE> as it is po|pularly called.

Thus, in 1180, the &s;hrine of St. <HI>Werburgh</HI> was brought out to &s;top the rage of a fire in the city, which for a long time was invincible by every other means; but the approach of the holy remains in&s;tantly proved their &s;anctity, by putting an end to its furious de&s;olation.</P>

<P>A STANDARD was the prize of emulation in the &s;ports cele|brated on the <HI>Rood-eye</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which was won in 1578 by &s;heriff <HI>Montford,</HI> on <HI>Shrove-Tue&s;day.</HI></NOTE>: but in the year 1609 the amu&s;ements took a new form; and under the reign of the peaceful <HI>James,</HI> the youthful cavaliers layed a&s;ide their mimic war, and began that &s;pecies of hor&s;eman&s;hip which the romantic philo&s;opher, lord <HI>Herbert,</HI> thought unworthy of a man of honor; "for," &s;ays he, 'the exerci&s;e I do not approve, is the running of hor&s;es, there 'being much cheating in that kind.</P>

<P>AN act of parlement was obtained for the recovering and pre&s;erving the navigation of the river, for &s;ettling the duties on &s;hips, and for the e&s;tabli&s;hing two ferries for the conve|niency of travellers into the county of <HI>Flint.</HI> Other acts were pa&s;&s;ed in the years 1732, 1740, 43, 1752; and the works were begun with vigor.

Much land has been gained from the &s;ea; and good farms now appear in places not long &s;ince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the unruly element.</P>

<P>I SHALL now take a &s;hort view of the trade of this city,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRADE.</NOTE> as it &s;tood in the years 1771 and 1776. I bring the la&s;t into &s;ight, in order to &s;hew how far this port has been affected by the commotions of our <HI>American</HI> &s;ubjects; and oppo&s;e it to the commerce of 1771, when it appears to have been in its meri|dian, &s;ince the re&s;toration of the channel. In that year were entered inwards</P>
<P>297 coa&s;ting-ve&s;&s;els; 19 of which were laden with groceries, and other goods from <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>526 coa&s;t &s;hips outwards; of the&s;e 23 came from the port of <HI>London,</HI> and were laden here with lead, iron cannon, two thou&s;and tons of chee&s;e, and other goods.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame year, 95 ve&s;&s;els were entered inwards from foreign parts; and 216 entered inwards from <HI>Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy,</HI> and <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>FROM <HI>Norway</HI> and the <HI>Baltic,</HI> are imported timber, flax, tal|low, hemp, iron, and deals.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Leghorn,</HI> large quantities of kid and lamb &s;kins; which are manufactured by the glovers, after being dre&s;&s;ed here.
<PB N="197" REF="220">
This, in fact, is the only manufacture which the city can boa&s;t of. I find, that in the reigns of queen <HI>Elizabeth, James</HI> I. and the be|ginning of that of <HI>Charles</HI> I. here was a va&s;t trade in calves &s;kins. In the fir&s;t of tho&s;e monopolizing times, the queen grants one <HI>Arthur Bal&s;ano</HI> a licence to export 6000 dickers of leather of calves &s;kins, ten dozens to every dicker, for &s;even years, paying five &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> dicker. <HI>James</HI> I. granted to <HI>James Maxwel</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a licence to export 18,000 dickers, for the &s;ame duty, and for twenty-one years; and this was afterwards confirmed to him by <HI>Charles</HI> I<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harleian</HI> MSS.

The fir&s;t grant might be made to him by <HI>James,</HI> to make amends for the mortifications he had un|dergone.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> are imported great quantities of cork, fruit, oil of olives, nuts, <HI>Barilla</HI> a&s;hes, and rai&s;ins; and &s;everal hundred tons of wine from <HI>Portugal;</HI> which la&s;t form the greate&s;t foreign import of this city.</P>
<P>WHILE the trade with <HI>America</HI> was open, fi&s;h and oil were brought from <HI>Newfoundland;</HI> and a &s;mall trade was carried on with <HI>Caroling.</HI></P>
<P>THE exports this year were upwards of 6000 chaldrons of coal from the <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Flint&s;hire</HI> collieries (which lie within this port); 1000 tons of lead; 300 of lead ore; 300 of oak

<P>FROM the table of entries it appears, that the great trade of this city is with <HI>Ireland;</HI> which receives annnally from hence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="199" REF="222">
a magazine) large quantities of hops, woollen cloths, wor&s;ted &s;tuffs, ho&s;iery, fu&s;tians, <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> goods, chee&s;e, wrought-iron, iron great guns, hardware, bound and unbound books, carpets, flint-gla&s;s, wrought &s;ilks, and great quantities of foreign goods &s;ent from <HI>London</HI> by land, and &s;hipped from this port.</P>
<P>IN return, it imports from <HI>Ireland,</HI> at the <HI>Mid&s;ummer</HI> and <HI>Michaelmas</HI> fairs, upwards of 1000 boxes and packs of linen cloth, containing 25,000 pieces at le&s;t: be&s;ides 300 boxes or packs imported into <HI>Leverpool,</HI> and &s;ent acro&s;s the <HI>Mer&s;ey</HI> to <HI>Ince,</HI> from whence they are conveyed in carts to <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> The&s;e form all together a million of yards each fair. This trade began no longer ago than the year 1736, in which 449, 654. yards were imported. The importations continually increa&s;ed till the la&s;t year of the late war; from which period it has been on a par.</P>
<P>IRELAND al&s;o &s;ends con&s;iderable quantities of lamb-&s;kins, wool, linen and bay-yarn, tallow, hides, butter, feathers, and quills, ox bones and hoofs, glue, &s;heep and cat guts; calve-velves, pro|vi&s;ions, and live cattle.</P>
<P>THE number of &s;hips belonging to this port &s;hew the uncom|mercial genius of its inhabitants; there being only twenty-two in the foreign trade, containing in all 1449 tons, and 169 men: and 13 in the coa&s;t-trade, who&s;e tonnage is 680 tons, and num|ber of men 58: yet the port extends, on the <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> &s;ide of the e&s;tuary, as far as the end of <HI>Wiral;</HI> and on the <HI>Flint&s;hire,</HI> to the <HI>Ver-r&yacute;d,</HI> or the mouth of the <HI>Clwyd.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was lately a very fair pro&s;pect of adding much to the trade of the city, by an i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">land navigation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CANAL.</NOTE> which was begun
<PB N="200" REF="223">
with great &s;pirit a few years ago. It was to run through the county beneath <HI>Bee&s;ton</HI> ca&s;tle, and to terminate near <HI>Middlewich.</HI> Another branch was to extend to <HI>Namptwich.</HI> One mouth opens into the <HI>Dee,</HI> below the water-tower. A fine ba&s;on is formed, into which the boats are to de&s;cend, by means of five &s;ucce&s;&s;ive locks, beneath the northern walls of the city, cut in the live rock. A few miles of this de&s;ign are completed: but, by an unhappy mi&s;calculation of expence, and by unfore&s;een difficul|ties occurring in the execution, &s;uch enormous charges were in|curred, as to put a &s;top for the pre&s;ent to all proceedings. The other branch, which was to extend towards <HI>Middlewich,</HI> was to end within a limited di&s;tance from the great canal between the <HI>Trent</HI> and <HI>Mer&s;ey</HI> navigation. The great objects were the &s;alt and chee&s;e trade; and coal for the &s;upply of the interior parts of <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> from the va&s;t collieries in <HI>Stafford&s;hire.</HI> Share al&s;o in the exportation of hard-ware, earthen-ware, and all the manu|factures of the internal part of the kingdom within its reach, might have been rea&s;onably expected.</P>
<P>THE idea of a canal along the dead flat between <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Ince</HI> has been long &s;ince conceived, by per&s;ons very conver&s;ant in the nature of the trade of this city. One mouth might have opened into the <HI>Dee</HI> in the place of the pre&s;ent; another near <HI>Ince,</HI> which would create a ready intercour&s;e with <HI>Leverpool,</HI> the <HI>Weever,</HI> and the &s;alt-works and great dairies on that river; with <HI>Warrington,</HI> and with the flouri&s;hing town of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> and a numerous &s;et of places within reach of the <HI>Mer&s;ey,</HI> and of the canal belonging to that u&s;eful Peer, the duke of <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> to which the greate&s;t of our inland navigations is connected.
<PB N="201" REF="224">
This little cut the city might, and &s;till may, enjoy unenvied, un|rivalled; and, what is a material con&s;ideration, the di&s;tance is trifling (&s;even miles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to <HI>Burdet</HI>'s map.</NOTE>); the expences &s;mall, and the profits to the undertakers great.</P>
<P>ON leaving the city, I repa&s;&s;ed <HI>Hanbridge;</HI> and at the may pole took the left-hand road, which is a continuation of the <HI>Roman</HI> road from the river. The &s;trait direction is the only proof of its antiquity, till it falls into the fields on the left, where its tract is often di&s;tingui&s;hable by certain ridges or ele|vated &s;pots.

<P>THE village of <HI>Eccle&s;ton</HI> is prettily &s;eated near the <HI>Dee,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ECCLESTON.</NOTE> and commands a view of the towers and &s;pires of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> ri&s;ing above the wooded banks.

<P>ECCLESTON retains the &s;ame name which it had at the Conque&s;t. It was held at that time by <HI>Gilbert de Venables,</HI> from <HI>Hag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lupus;</HI> before that event, by <HI>Edwin</HI> a freeman. On the deme&s;ne land were two &s;ervants, four villeyns, and a boor, a boat and a net.

He was met on the confines of this by 5000 hor&s;emen, among which were the fir&s;t fortunes of <HI>Shrop&s;hire.</HI> He met with re&s;pect, in every town, little &s;hort of adoration.

<P>FROM hence I ha&s;tened towards <HI>Chirk</HI> ca&s;tle, keeping a lower road between the two dikes.

The inner dike is made of loo&s;e &s;tones, with a wall of va&s;t thickne&s;s on the top. Within the area are many ve&s;tiges of buildings, the habitations of the old po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. It lies between the <HI>Offa</HI>'s and the <HI>Wat</HI>'s dike.

Along one &s;ide of the bank runs the dike; and at the end, between the two vales, impending over them, are &s;mall but &s;trong entrenchments. One &s;urrounds a work of a pentagon form; beyond which, at the very verge, is a mount that &s;eems to have been a <HI>dernier re&s;ort</HI> to the garri&s;on, in ca&s;e they had been beaten out of the former.

Above the pillars is abundance of grote&s;que carv|ing, in ridicule of the regular clergy, and the female religious, abbe&s;&s;es and nuns; and over the arches of the nave, are many of the arms of the old <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> princes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMBS.</NOTE> The tombs are numerous. The mo&s;t antient is of a knight all armed: at his feet is a dog, and beyond that a dragon, who&s;e tail ter|minates in a &s;erpent's head. On his &s;hield is a lion rampant.

<P>SUCH was the &s;tate of the dome&s;tic affairs of <HI>Glyndwr</HI> at the change of government in 1399. His re&s;entment again&s;t the u&s;urper was whetted by wrongs public and private: by the murder of the unhappy <HI>Richard,</HI> to whom he was &s;trongly attach|ed by being a per&s;onal favorite; and by the &s;trong partiality the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> had for their late king.</P>

<P>THIS in&s;ult was aggravated by another injury. When <HI>Henry</HI> went on his expedition again&s;t the <HI>Scots, Owen</HI> was to have been &s;ummoned, among other barons, to attend the king with his va&s;&s;als. The writ for that purpo&s;e was delivered to <HI>Reginald</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vi&s;a Ricardi, ii. 171.</NOTE>, who de&s;ignedly neglected to deliver it till the time was nearly

<P>THE danger of driving into de&s;perate mea&s;ures a per&s;on of his intere&s;t, &s;pirit, and abilities, was fore&s;een by <HI>John Trevor</HI> bi&s;hop of St. <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> who advi&s;ed more temperate proceedings; that <HI>Owen</HI> was by no means a de&s;picable enemy; and that the <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l&s;h</HI> would certainly be provoked into a general in&s;urrection.

<P>IT does not appear that <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> till this period, had any &s;ettled de&s;ign of flinging off the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> yoke.

<P>THE <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">OWEN REPUTED A MAGICIAN.</NOTE> willing to cover their &s;hame, attributed the cau&s;e of their di&s;grace to the incantations of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> chieftain; 'who,' as an old hi&s;torian expre&s;&s;es, <Q>through art magike (as was thought) cau&s;ed &s;uch foule weather of winds, tempe&s;t, raine, &s;now, and haile, to be rai&s;ed for the annoiance of the king's armie, that the like had not beene heard of.</Q> Perhaps <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> as well to infu&s;e terror into his foes, as to give his people a more exalted notion of him, might politically in&s;i|nuate his &s;kill in &s;pells and charms, that they might &s;uppo&s;e him aided by more than mortal power.

<P>HENRY quickly received news from the north, that &s;erved to alleviate the ill &s;ucce&s;s of his inva&s;ion.

<P>THIS battle was productive of great events; and proved in the end the de&s;truction of the <HI>Percy</HI> family.

<P>FORTUNE now began to frown upon <HI>Glyndwr.</HI> The fir&s;t experience he had of her mutability was on the 11th of <HI>March:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BATTLE OF USKE;</NOTE> a body of his partizans, to the amount of eight thou|&s;and, had a&s;&s;embled out of <HI>Glamorgan&s;hire, U&s;ke, Netherwent,</HI> and <HI>Overwent.</HI> As u&s;ual, they began their march with de&s;olat|ing the country; and burnt part of the town of <HI>Gro&s;mont,</HI> in the county of <HI>Monmouth.

ready to open the campaign.

He begins with imploring Heaven for its favor towards his father: <HI>Je &s;upplie vraiement que</HI> DIEU <HI>vous montre graciou&s;ment pour vous &s;on miracle on toutes parties, loez &s;oit il en toutes &s;es ocures.&mdash;Il e&s;t bien voirs, que la victoire n'e&s;t pas en le multitude de people mes en la pui&s;&s;ance de</HI> DIEU.</P>

<P>AFTER the&s;e defeats, all <HI>Glamorgan&s;hire</HI> &s;ubmitted to the king, a few faithful friends only excepted; who, on di&s;covering that <HI>Owen</HI> was alive, fled and joined him. It was at this time that he &s;uffered tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> attribute to the latter part of his life. During this di&s;per&s;ion of his friends, he was obliged to &s;eek protection from a few tru&s;ty partizans; and often to conceal him&s;elf in caves and de&s;ert places. A cavern near the &s;ea-&s;ide, in the pari&s;h of <HI>Llangelynin,</HI> in the county of <HI>Merioneth,</HI> is &s;till called <HI>Ogof Owain,</HI> in which he was &s;ecretly &s;upported by <HI>Ednyfed ap Aaron,</HI> of the tribe of <HI>Ednowain ap Bradwen.</HI></P>
<P>THE bard <HI>Jolo G&ocirc;ch</HI> deplores his ab&s;ence; and calls him home from different parts of the globe, to re-po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of

<P>ABOUT this time the earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> began another con&s;piracy; which was detected, and &s;everal of his adherents were executed. Among others, one Sir <HI>John Griffith,</HI> a <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> knight; which makes it probable, that the earl and <HI>Glyndwr</HI> &s;till acted in concert. The king, by his activity, quickly fru&s;|trated this plot; &s;eized on the earl's ca&s;tles, and obliged him to fly into <HI>Scotland</HI> for protection. With him fled the bi&s;hops of St. <HI>A&s;aph</HI> and <HI>Bangor</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ferdun.

<P>HENRY then returned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HENRY MARCHRS AGAIN INTO WALES</NOTE> and marched into <HI>Wales</HI> with an army of 37,000 men.

<P>FROM the latter end of la&s;t year, the affairs of <HI>Glyndwr</HI> began to decline.

&s;o precarious &s;eemed the tenure, even in the declining &s;tate of our chie&s;tain. I may remark, that he &s;till had &s;trength enough to give protection to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fugitives.

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this o&s;tentation of regal power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HIS AFFAIRS DE|CLINE.</NOTE> the affairs of <HI>Glyndwr</HI> evidently declined.

<P>FROM this period <HI>Owen</HI> never made any attempts worthy of hi&s;toric notice.

from <HI>Tacitus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De moribus German.</NOTE>. The <HI>Druids</HI> ob&s;erved the &s;ame, with the wild addition of what&s;oever was of u&s;e in this life, under the notion that they would be wanted by the decea&s;ed in the world below; and in confirmation of this, arms, and many &s;ingular things, of unknown u&s;e, are to this day di&s;covered beneath the places of antient &s;epulture<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mela, lib. iii. c. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE remote <HI>Sarmatae,</HI> and all the <HI>Scandinavian</HI> nations, agreed in the burning of the dead; and the <HI>Danes</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed by this, and the different funeral ceremonies, three &s;everal epochs<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wormii Mon. Danic. 40.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t, which was the &s;ame with that in que&s;tion, was called <HI>Roi&s;old</HI> and <HI>Brende-tiide,</HI> or the age of burning.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd was &s;tyled <HI>Hoigold,</HI> and <HI>Hoiel&s;e-tiide,</HI> or the age of <HI>tumuli,</HI> or hillocks. The corp&s;e at this period was placed entire, with all the ornaments which graced it during life. The bracelets, or arms, and even the hor&s;e of the departed hero, were placed beneath the heap. Money, and all the rich property of the decea&s;ed, u&s;ed to be buried with him, from the per&s;ua&s;ion that the &s;oul was immortal<NOTE N="&verbar;" PLACE="foot">Pomponius Mela, <HI>lib.</HI> iii. c. 2.</NOTE> and would &s;tand in need of the&s;e things in the other life. Such was the notion both of the <HI>Gauls</HI> and of the northern nations. Among the la&s;t, when py|racy was e&s;teemed honorable, the&s;e illu&s;trious robbers directed that all their rich plunder &s;hould be depo&s;ited with their re|mains<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Bartholinus <HI>Antiq.</HI> Dan. 438.</NOTE>, in order to &s;timulate their offspring to &s;upport them|&s;elves, and the glory of their name, by deeds of arms. Hence it is we hear of the va&s;t riches di&s;covered in &s;epulchres, and of
<PB N="383" REF="425">
the frequent violation of the remains of the dead, in expecta|tion of trea&s;ures, even for centuries after this cu&s;tom had cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE third age was called <HI>Chri&s;tendoms-old,</HI> when the introduc|tion of Chri&s;tianity put a &s;top to the former cu&s;toms: for 'Chri&s;tians,' as the learned phy&s;ician of <HI>Norwich</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>ab|horred this &s;pecies of ob&s;equies; and though they &s;tickt not to give their bodies to be burnt in their lives, dete&s;ted that mode after death; affecting rather depo&s;iture than ab&s;umption, and properly &s;ubmitted unto the &s;entence of GOD, to return not unto a&s;hes, but to du&s;t again.</Q></P>
<P>FROM the remarks of the&s;e able writers, we may learn the time of the abolition of the cu&s;tom of burning among the &s;e|veral nations; for it cea&s;ed with pagani&s;m. It therefore fell fir&s;t into di&s;u&s;e with the <HI>Britons;</HI> for it was for &s;ome time retained by the <HI>Saxons</HI> after their conque&s;t of this king|dom; but was left off on their receiving the light of the go|&s;pel. The <HI>Danes</HI> retained the cu&s;tom of urn-burial the la&s;t of any: for of all the northern nations who had any footing in the&s;e kingdoms, they were the late&s;t who embraced the doc|trines of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>I CANNOT e&s;tabli&s;h any criterion by which a judgment may be made of the people to whom the different &s;pecies of urns and tumuli belonged, whether they are <HI>Briti&s;h, Roman, Saxon,</HI> or <HI>Dani&s;h.</HI></P>

<P>FROM <HI>Llanarmon</HI> I continued my journey along the bad roads of that pari&s;h. The country now grows more contracted, by the approximation of the hills. On one &s;ide are the rocky ledges of lime&s;tone, in the town&s;hip of <HI>Tre'r Yrys,</HI> rich in lead-ore; and which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have taken its name from <HI>Gyrys,</HI> who made the fir&s;t collection of <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> proverbs, known by the name of <HI>Mad-waith b&eacute;n Gyrys o Jal,</HI> or the good work of old Gyrys of <HI>Yale.</HI></P>
<P>ON the left are the <HI>Clwydian</HI> hills, which divide this country from the vale of <HI>Clwyd.</HI> The&s;e are cultivated pretty high; are free from rocks, covered with heath.</P>
<P>THERE is a <HI>Bwlch,</HI> or pa&s;s through the&s;e hills, of a mo&s;t re|markable name, lying between the &s;ummits called <HI>Moel Eithinen,</HI> and <HI>Moel Fenlli,</HI> in this pari&s;h. This is called <HI>Bwlch Agricla,</HI> or the pa&s;s of <HI>Agriccla;</HI> and, &s;ince there is no other tran&s;lation to be given of the <HI>wel&s;h</HI> word, we may conjecture this to have been his pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Mona.</HI> That the <HI>Romans</HI> were in after-times re&s;ident in the&s;e parts, is evident from the number of coins found
<PB N="389" REF="431">
in the neighborhood, particularly in the pari&s;h of <HI>Llanverres,</HI> where abundance of <HI>Denarii</HI> have been met with.</P>
<P>MOEL FENLLI, or <HI>Benlli</HI>'s hill, is remarkable for having on it a &s;trong <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> po&s;t, guarded as u&s;ual by dikes and fo&s;&s;es. This probably was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a chieftain of that name; for <HI>Nen|nius</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">C. xxx. xxxi</NOTE> &s;peaks of &s;uch a <HI>regulus</HI> of the country of <HI>Yale;</HI> but, as too u&s;ual with our antient hi&s;torians, blends &s;o ridiculous a legend with the mention of him, as would de&s;troy belief of his exi&s;tence, did not the hill remain a po&s;&s;ible evidence. St. <HI>Ger|manus,</HI> &s;ays the abbot, de&s;igned to make this <HI>Benlli</HI> a vi&s;it; but meeting with a mo&s;t inho&s;pitable reception, was kindly enter|tained by a &s;ervant of the king in his humble cottage; who killed his only calf, dre&s;&s;ed, and placed it before the &s;aint and his companions. This goodne&s;s met with its reward; for lo! the next morning the identical calf was found alive and well with its mother.</P>
<P>A LITTLE beyond this pa&s;s, entered the pari&s;h of <HI>Llanverres,</HI> rich in mineral. Pa&s;s through the village, and by the church. The la&s;t is dedicated to St. <HI>Berres (Britius)</HI> di&s;ciple of St. <HI>Mar|tin</HI> the <HI>Hungarian,</HI> and his &s;ucce&s;or in the bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Tours,</HI> the latter end of the fourth century.

<P>THE ea&s;t end of the old church was repaired in 1650, by Dr. <HI>John Davies,</HI> the author of the <HI>Wel&s;h-Latin</HI> dictionary, a mo&s;t &s;kilful antiquary; native of this pari&s;h.</P>

adorned with a very hand&s;ome &s;teeple built of late years. Before the Reformation, it belonged to the abby of <HI>Bu&s;tle&s;ham,</HI> or <HI>By|&s;ham,</HI> in <HI>Berk&s;hire.</HI> The living is a vicarage, and has dependent on it the chapelries of <HI>Nerquys</HI> and <HI>Treuddyn.</HI></P>
<P>THE architecture of the church is of the gothic of that pe|riod, the windows large, and their arches obtu&s;e. Within and without, is a row of animals carved, as u&s;ual at that period.

Between the &s;prings of every arch is an angel holding a &s;hield, on which are either the arms of benefactors, or the in&s;truments of the Pa&s;&s;ion. The arms of the <HI>Stanlies,</HI> who long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this manor, are very frequent. Among the other &s;culptures, is the <HI>Veronica,</HI> or face of our Saviour impre&s;&s;ed on a handkerchief given to him by a woman on his way to the place of crucifixion. He took it, wiped his face, and returned it with the miraculous impre&s;&s;ion.

<P>MUCH of the ore obtained in our country is &s;melted in the &s;everal furnaces belonging to different companies: much al&s;o is exported in the form of ore.

<P>THE reader need not be told, that the former were the years of mineral plenty; and &s;uch, which I mu&s;t &s;ay, are &s;eldom known.

<P>CALAMINE is found in great abundance in the veins of lime|&s;tone and chert, in the &s;ame manner as the ores of lead. Where there is plenty of the former, there is little or none of the lat|ter. The calamine is al&s;o entirely confined to the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the country. About a thou&s;and tons of this mineral is an|nually exported. I have mentioned, in p. 62. how little it was known in <HI>Flint&s;hire</HI> till within the&s;e &s;ixty years; and may here add, that we were indebted to <HI>John Barrow,</HI> a native of <HI>Somer&s;et|&s;hire,</HI> who being well acquainted with that mineral in his own country, pointed out to us its u&s;es.</P>
<P>CALAMINE a&s;&s;umes various &s;hapes and colors. Green, yellow, red, and black, often has a &s;tony appearance, and often like the lattice work of bones. The riche&s;t looks like bees-wax; but that &s;pecies is not common any more than the curious cry|&s;tallized &s;pecimens.</P>

<Q><P>The damp had been perceived for &s;ome time before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">IN MOSTYN COLLIERY.</NOTE> re&s;em|bling fiery blades darting and cro&s;&s;ing each other from both &s;ides of the pit. The u&s;ual methods were taken to free the pit from this evil. After a ce&s;&s;ation of work for three days, the &s;teward thinking to fetch a compa&s;s about from the eye of the pit that came from the day, and to bring wind by a &s;ecure way along with him, that, if it bur&s;t again, it might be done without danger of men's lives, went down, and took two men along with him, which &s;erved his turn for this purpo&s;e. He was no &s;ooner down, but the re&s;t of the work|men that had wrought there, di&s;daining to be left behind in &s;uch a time of danger, ha&s;ted down after them; and one of them, more indi&s;creet than the re&s;t, went headlong with his candle over the eye of the damp-pit, at which the damp im|mediately catched, and flew to and fro over all the hollows of the work, with a great wind, and a continual fire; and, as it went, keeping a mighty great roaring noi&s;e on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>THE men, at fir&s;t appearance of it, had mo&s;t of them fallen upon their faces, and hid them&s;elves as well as they could, in

the loo&s;e, &s;lack, or &s;mall-coal, and under the &s;helter of po&s;ts; yet, neverthele&s;s, the damp returning out of the hollows, and drawing towards the eye of the pit, it came up with incredible force; the wind and fire tore mo&s;t of their clothes off their backs, and &s;inged what was left, burning their hair, faces, and hands; the bla&s;ts falling &s;o &s;harp on their &s;kin, as if they had been whipt with cords. Some, that had le&s;t &s;helter, were carried fifteen or &s;ixteen yards from their fir&s;t &s;tation, and beaten again&s;t the roof of the coal, and &s;ides of the po&s;t, and lay afterwards a good while &s;en&s;ele&s;s; &s;o that it was long be|fore they could hear or find one another. As it drew up to the day-pit, it caught one of the men along with it, that was next to the eye; and up it comes, with &s;uch a terrible crack, not unlike, but more &s;hrill, than a cannon, that was heard fif|teen miles off, with the wind; and &s;uch a pillar of &s;moak, as darkened all the &s;ky over-head for a good while. The brow of the hill above the pit was eighteen yards high, and on it grew trees of fourteen or fifteen yards long; yet the man's body, and other things from the pit, were &s;een above the tops of the highe&s;t trees, at lea&s;t 100 yards. On this pit &s;tood a hor&s;e-engine of &s;ub&s;tantial timber, and &s;trong iron work; on which lay a trunk, or barrel, for winding the rope up and down, of above 1000 pounds weight; it was then in motion, one bucket going down, and the other coming up full of wa|ter. This trunk was fa&s;tened to that frame with locks and bolts of iron; yet it was thrown up, and carried a good way from the pit; and pieces of it, though bound with iron-hoops and &s;trong nails, blown into the woods about: &s;o likewi&s;e were
<PB N="244" REF="466">
the two buckets; and the ends of the rope, after the buckets were blown from them, &s;tood a while upright in the air like pikes, and then came lei&s;urely drilling down. The whole frame of the engine was &s;tirred, and moved out of its place; and tho&s;e mens clothes, caps, and hats, that e&s;caped, were afterwards found &s;hattered to pieces, and thrown among&s;t the woods a great way from the pit.</P></Q>
<P>FROM <HI>Nannerch,</HI> I continued my journey along the narrow vale, picture&s;quely ornamented with hanging woods. Leave the church of <HI>Skeiviog</HI> on the right.

<P>AT the junction of the vales of <HI>Nannerch</HI> and <HI>Bodvari,</HI> I a&s;|cended to <HI>Caerwys;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAERWYS.</NOTE> a town mouldering away with age. It con&s;i&s;ts of four &s;treets, cro&s;&s;ing each other at right angles, an|&s;wering to the four points of the compa&s;s. The name, as <HI>Camden</HI> has long &s;ince ob&s;erved, &s;avors of great antiquity.
<PB N="425" REF="467"><HI>Caer,</HI> the fortre&s;s and <HI>Gw&ycirc;s,</HI> a &s;ummon, which &s;hews it had been in early times, the place of judicature; and it certainly had that honor long before it was removed to the county-town of <HI>Flint.</HI> I will not a&s;&s;ert that it had been a <HI>Roman</HI> &s;tation, notwith&s;tanding I am credibly informed, that in the pre&s;ent century, a number of copper coins were found in a bottom below the town; and there &s;till remains in the pari&s;h, a Latin in&s;cription, cut in rude letters, on an unhewn upright &s;tone to this effect: HIC JACIT MULI ERBO . . . .

Whether this in&s;cription referred to any heroine that fell on this place, I will not dare to affirm.

<P>CAERWYS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 360.</NOTE>, with a neighboring town now lo&s;t, called <HI>Tref Edwyn,</HI> and <HI>Rhuddlan,</HI> had been, from very early time, the &s;eats of the judicature for the&s;e parts of <HI>Wales.</HI> In 1281, the noble|men of <HI>Tegengl</HI> layed before the archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> (who came down on the Chri&s;tian de&s;ign of reconciling the differ|ences between <HI>Edward</HI> I. and <HI>Llewelyn</HI>) the infringement of their liberties in this particular; a&s;&s;erting, that it was the tenor of their privilege to be judged according to the laws of <HI>Wales,</HI> at tho&s;e three places; and that the be&s;t men of the country were taken becau&s;e they de&s;ired to be judged at <HI>Tref Edwyn</HI> by the laws of <HI>Wales</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. How far their complaints were remedied does

not appear: but when ju&s;ticiary courts were in after times ap|pointed, <HI>Caerwys</HI> recovered its antient honors. In this town were held the great &s;e&s;&s;ions. It had its town-hall, and its jail; and was the place of execution. It remained the place of ju|dicature till &s;ometime pa&s;t the middle of the la&s;t century, when the courts were removed to <HI>Flint.</HI></P>
<P>IN the year 1241, or the 26th of <HI>Henry</HI> III. that prince granted to the inhabitants of <HI>Tegengl,</HI> a charter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mo&s;tyn</HI> MSS.</NOTE>, exempting them from the <HI>amobr;</HI> but at the &s;ame time, impo&s;es on them an obliga|tion to find twenty-four people, who were to keep the peace of the country: and obliges this town, <HI>Picton, Axton,</HI> and other hamlets, to find three men each, to work three days in the harve&s;t, as they were wont in the days of the two preceding <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> princes. This &s;eems during &s;ome temporary advantage which <HI>Henry</HI> had over the <HI>Wel&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>CAERWYS has the mo&s;t con&s;iderable fairs for cattle, &s;heep and hor&s;es, in all the county. They are of great antiquity. The fir&s;t <HI>John Trevor,</HI> bi&s;hop of St. <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> appears among the &s;ub|&s;cribers to a charter for a market in 1356; but the markets have now failed entirely, &s;ince the increa&s;e of <HI>Holywell.</HI></P>

<P>BUT what gave a particular glory to the town of <HI>Caerwys,</HI> was the honor it had of being the place of the <HI>Ei&s;teddfod,</HI> or the
<PB N="427" REF="469">
&s;e&s;&s;ions of the bards and min&s;trels for many centuries. It was the re&s;ort of tho&s;e of a certain di&s;trict; as <HI>Aberfraw</HI> in <HI>Angle&s;ea</HI> was of tho&s;e of that i&s;land, and the neighboring county; and <HI>Mathraval</HI> of tho&s;e of the land of <HI>Powys.</HI> The rea&s;on that the&s;e places were thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, was, becau&s;e the two la&s;t were the re&s;idence of princes; and <HI>Caerwys,</HI> on account of the royal palace that &s;tood below the town, the re&s;idence of <HI>Llewelyn ap Gryffydd.</HI></P>
<P>THESE <HI>Ei&s;teddfods</HI> were the <HI>Briti&s;h Olympics.</HI> Fired at fir&s;t with generous emulation, our poets crowded into the li&s;t, and carried off the prize, contented with the mere honor of vic|tory. At length, when the competitors became numerous, and the country became oppre&s;&s;ed with the multitude, new regula|tions of cour&s;e took place. The di&s;appointed candidates were no longer &s;uffered to torture the ears of the principality with their wretched compo&s;itions. None but bards of merit were &s;uffered to rehear&s;e their pieces; and min&s;trels of &s;kill, to perform. The&s;e went through a long probation: judges were appointed to decide on their re&s;pective abilities; and degrees &s;uitable were conferred, and permi&s;&s;ions granted for exerci&s;ing their ta|lents, in the manner that will be related in the following pages. The judges were appointed by commi&s;&s;ion from our princes; and after the conque&s;t of <HI>Wales,</HI> by the kings of <HI>England,</HI> notwith&s;tanding, <HI>Edward</HI> I. exerci&s;ed a political cruelty over the generation of bards of his time; yet future princes thought fit to revive an in&s;titution &s;o likely to &s;often the manners of a fierce people. The crown had the power of nominating the judges, who decided not only on the merit, but the &s;ubject of
<PB N="428" REF="470">
the poems; and, like our modern lord chamberlains, were cer|tain of licen&s;ing only tho&s;e which were agreeable to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> court.</P>
<P>BEFORE I enter on the account of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Briti&s;h Ei&s;tedd&s;fods,</HI> I &s;hall ju&s;t mention the high antiquity of the cha|racter that made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT BARDS.</NOTE> in after times, the principal figure in the&s;e meetings.

<P>AFTER the times of the princes, the great men, their de&s;cen|dants, took the&s;e people under their care and protection, allow|ing

<P>THE bards were in the highe&s;t repute. I cannot give a &s;trong|er idea of the e&s;teem they were in, than by citing from the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> laws, the account of their rank in the prince's court, and the various rewards and fees they were entitled to, and the &s;evere penalties that were enacted to pre&s;erve their per&s;ons from in&s;ult. They were &s;uppo&s;ed to be endowed with powers equal to in&s;pi|ration. They were the oral hi&s;torians of all pa&s;t tran&s;actions, public and private. They related the great events of the &s;tate; and, like the <HI>&s;calds</HI> of the northern nations, retained the memo|ry of numberle&s;s tran&s;actions, which otherwi&s;e would have pe|ri&s;hed in oblivion. They were likewi&s;e thoroughly acquainted with the works of the three primary bards, <HI>viz.</HI> MYRDDYN AP MORFRYN, MYRDDYN EMRYS, and TALIESIN BEN BEIRDD. But they had another talent, which probably endeared them more than all the re&s;t to the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> nobility; that of being mo&s;t accom|pli&s;hed genealogi&s;ts, and flattering their vanity, in &s;inging the deeds of an ance&s;try derived from the mo&s;t di&s;tant period.</P>

<P>WHEN a &s;ong is called for, the <HI>Cadeir-fardd,</HI> or the bard who has got the <HI>badge of the chair,</HI> is fir&s;t to &s;ing a hymn in glory of GOD; after that, another in honor of the prince.

<P>No public fe&s;tivity, great fea&s;t, or wedding could be duly &s;olemnized without the pre&s;ence of the bards and min&s;trels. A glorious emulation aro&s;e among them; and prizes were be&s;towed on the mo&s;t worthy. In 1176, the lord <HI>Rhys</HI> prince of <HI>South Wales,</HI> made a great fea&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Powel, 237.</NOTE> at <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> on account of the fini&s;h|ing his new ca&s;tle at <HI>Aberteifi;</HI> of which he proclamed notice through all <HI>Britain</HI> a year and a day before; great was the re&s;ort of &s;trangers, who were nobly entertained; &s;o that none departed un&s;atisfied. Among deeds of arms, and variety of <HI>&s;pectacles,</HI> RHYS invited all the bards of <HI>Wales,</HI> and provided <HI>chairs</HI> for them, which were placed in his hall, where they fat and di&s;|puted, and &s;ang, to &s;hew their &s;kill in their re&s;pective faculties, and be&s;towed great rewards, and rich gifts on the victors. The bards of <HI>North Wales</HI> won the prizes; but the min&s;trels of <HI>Rhys</HI>'s hou&s;hold, excelled in their faculty. On this occa&s;ion the <HI>Brawdwr Llys,</HI> or <HI>judge of the court,</HI> an officer fifth in rank, declared aloud the victor, and received from the bard, for his fee, a mighty

<P>THE bards of tho&s;e times often accompanied their voices with the harp, as they were wont of old, in the manner de&s;cribed by <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. xv. 9.</NOTE>. There was al&s;o another &s;pecies of mu&s;i|cian, of an inferior kind, called <HI>Datceiniad,</HI> who accompanied the mu&s;ical in&s;truments of others with his &s;ong. He was infe|rior to both bard and min&s;trel; yet it was requi&s;ite he &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con&s;iderable degree of knowledge in both &s;ci|ences: he ought to be able to tune the harp and <HI>crwth:</HI> to &s;hew his &s;kill in playing &s;everal notes and keys, and to be perfectly conver&s;ant in what are called the twenty-four mea&s;ures of in&s;tru|mental &s;ong; and to be able to &s;ing with judgment and melody. He was likewi&s;e to be ma&s;ter of reading ju&s;tly, and writing correctly. He was not only to under&s;tand the twenty|four modes of metrical compo&s;itions; but to exhibit &s;pecimens of his own, at left in three of them; and if he met with any old &s;ong faultily tran&s;cribed, he was to rectify it. He was al&s;o to carry with him a harp or a <HI>crwth</HI> in a white ca&s;e. He was further required, not only to be a ready waiter at table, but to be an expert carver of every &s;pecies of fowl. At the weddings of any of the royal family, his office was to wait on the bride.</P>
<P>ON tho&s;e occa&s;ions, I am reminded of another cu&s;tom in which the bards were concerned. After their nuptial fea&s;t, a <HI>Pencerdd</HI> was con&s;tituted CYFF CLER, or <HI>pillar of the cl&ecirc;r,</HI> and
