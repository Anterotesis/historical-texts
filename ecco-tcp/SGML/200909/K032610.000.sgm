<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>opinion</HI> of Mr. Hat&s;ell, (in his <Q><HI>Precedents of Pro|ceedings in the Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI></Q> under the title of <Q><HI>King calls the Parliament,</HI></Q>) as compendiou&s;ly &s;tated by my worthy and very learn|ed friend, Mr. Lofft, in p. 5 of his Ob&s;ervations, is a much more fa|vourable con&s;truction than Mr. Hat&s;ell's <HI>own words</HI> can really warrant; though all per&s;ons, who are acquainted with that gentleman's very a|miable character, (including the writer of this remark,) have rea&s;on to wi&s;h, for his &s;ake, that his <HI>opinion</HI> (whatever it may be) had been &s;o expre&s;&s;ed as to be really limited by the moderate and very friendly con|&s;truction which Mr. Lofft has put upon it. Mr. Lofft &s;uppo&s;es the <HI>opi|nion</HI> of Mr. Hat&s;ell to be, that <Q><HI>the intent of the &s;tatutes of Edward, and the ancient law and con&s;titution of the kingdom, require parliaments to</HI> SIT <HI>once at lea&s;t in every year, but</HI> NOT <HI>that they &s;hould be</HI> ANNUALLY, OR OFTENER, ELECTED;</Q> but Mr. Hat&s;ell him&s;elf, if we may judge by his manner of writing, is far from admitting that <HI>the con&s;titution requires parliaments</HI> even <HI>to</HI> SIT once a year, or that <Q><HI>the king is obli|ged to call a parliament once at lea&s;t in every year;</HI></Q> for this he has contemptuou&s;ly treated merely as <HI>'a notion'</HI> (that) <Q><HI>has been &s;ome|times entertained;</HI></Q> (p. 196, n.) and he, a&s;&s;erts, that <Q><HI>tho&s;e per&s;ons, who maintain</HI> THIS DOCTRINE,</Q> (i. e. the doctrine la&s;t cited in his own words, as a <HI>general</HI> doctrine, having two different accep|tations, ari&s;ing from the 4th and 36th Edward III.) <HI>'do not mean'</HI> (&s;ays he) <Q><HI>that, according to the&s;e &s;tatutes,</HI> A SESSION <HI>of parliament &s;hall be hol|den every year, but that</HI> A NEW ELECTION &s;hall be had, &amp;c.</Q>&mdash; In an|&s;wer to which, it may be &s;ufficient to oppo&s;e one eminent example for all: viz. that the learned commentator, Judge Black&s;tone, notoriou&s;|ly denied, as well as him&s;elf, that the <HI>latter</HI> doctrine <HI>'ever was'</HI> the <HI>mean|ing</HI> of tho&s;e ancient &s;tatutes, though he actually was one of <Q><HI>tho&s;e per|&s;ons who maintained</HI></Q> the <HI>former</HI> general con&s;truction of the &s;aid &s;ta|tutes (the only operative con&s;truction they are <HI>now</HI> capable of bearing &s;ince the traver&s;e of the modern acts for <HI>triennial</HI> and <HI>&s;eptennial</HI> elections) as being &s;till in force to <HI>bind the king.</HI> See 1 Com. c. 2, p. 152 &amp; 153: where the learned writer, having mentioned that <Q><HI>the king only can con|voke a parliament,</HI></Q> immediately adds, <Q><HI>and</HI> THIS, <HI>by the ancient &s;ta|tutes of the realm,</HI> HE IS BOUND TO DO EVERY YEAR, <HI>or oftener if need be;</HI></Q> for which, in a note, he expre&s;sly cites the&s;e &s;tatutes of K.

Edward III. he did not (it &s;eems) think them worthy even to be named in his <HI>text,</HI> but only in a <HI>note,</HI> (to &s;hew that he had not forgot them,) where he has treated even their <HI>general</HI> con&s;truction merely as "<HI>a notion,</HI> &amp;c." See p. 196-199.</P>
<P>But, though the original meaning and force of the&s;e ancient &s;tatutes are materially affected and injured by the modern acts for <HI>triennial</HI> and <HI>&s;eptennial</HI> parliaments, yet they are certainly &s;till in force (as Judge
<PB N="5" REF="4">Black&s;tone has allowed) to <HI>oblige</HI> the king <HI>'to permit a parliament to &s;it annually for the redre&s;s of grievances and di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s;'</HI> and this, without impediment from the words <HI>'if need be'</HI> in the <HI>'loo&s;e and vague'</HI> manner that the Judge has applied them, contrary to the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>gram|matical</HI> con&s;truction of the whole &s;entence: (&s;ee 'Declaration of the 'People's Rights, p. 166 to 169, n.)&mdash;For our right to an <HI>annual &s;e&s;|&s;ion of parliament</HI> is founded on the ancient con&s;titution of the kingdom, &mdash; on laws that are almo&s;t coeval with our national exi&s;tence in this i&s;land. See the <HI>'u&s;age perpetual'</HI> ordained by K. Alfred, and cited by Lord Coke, 1 In&s;t. p. 110. viz. <HI>'Le Roy Alfred'</HI> (fi&s;t) <Q><HI>a&s;&s;em|bler les Counties, &amp;c. et ordeina, pur</HI> USAGE PERPETUEL, <HI>que deux foitz par an, ou pluis &s;ovent, pour mi&s;ter</HI></Q> (me&s;tier) <Q><HI>in temps de peace, &s;e a&s;&s;emblerent a Londres, a parliamenter &s;ur le guidament del people de Dieu, &amp;c.</HI></Q>&mdash; The te&s;timony of Knighton, (<Q>one of our be&s;t hi&s;|torians,</Q> as Mr. Petyt calls him in his preface to the Ancient Right of the Commons, p. 41.) <Q><HI>that, by an ancient</HI> STATUTE <HI>and</HI> CUSTOM, <HI>laudable and approved, which nobody could deny, the king was</HI> ONCE IN A YEAR <HI>to convene his</HI> LORDS <HI>and</HI> COMMONS <HI>to his Court of Parlia|ment,</HI></Q> &amp;c.

Clau&s; 10 Edw. II. m. 28, intus; that <HI>"upon a petition to the king,"</HI> (K. Edw. II.) '<HI>he granted that</HI> "SEMEL IN ANNO TENEATUR <HI>parliamentum,"</HI> &amp;c. whence it is evident, that the act of 4 Edw. III. c. 14, was not a <HI>new</HI> law, but a declaration of the <HI>old</HI> con&s;titution, viz. <Q><HI>That a parliament &s;hall be holden every year once, and more often if need be;</HI></Q> which was again confirmed by &s;tatute in the 36 Ed. III. c. 10. And the USAGE of tho&s;e times (proved by the <HI>writs i&s;&s;ued for general elections</HI> frequently <Q>MORE OFTEN</Q> than 'ONCE' in a year) excludes all <HI>'doubtful'</HI>-ne&s;s from the&s;e ancient &s;tatutes; &s;o that <HI>new</HI> parliaments mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been under&s;tood, until (by the traver&s;e of modern acts) they became applicable only to the <HI>annual &s;itting</HI> of parliament.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ers of the original meaning (viz for <HI>annual elections,</HI> and <HI>more often</HI>) have rendered that con&s;truction &s;till more obvious by their own mi&s;erable &s;hifts to evade it! One &s;ays, &mdash; the words are <Q><HI>loo&s;e and vague,</HI></Q> though &s;uch a charge is applicable only to his own <HI>un|grammatical</HI> con&s;truction; and another would render the acts <HI>doubt|ful,</HI> by boldly excluding the only ju&s;t criterion for <Q><HI>clearing up doubts</HI></Q> in &s;uch a ca&s;e, viz. the USAGE <HI>of the times in which the acts were made;</HI> and, in&s;tead of it, would have us refer ONLY to <Q><HI>the practice</HI></Q> and to <HI>'the opinion'</HI> of per&s;ons who lived from 200 to 400 years after tho&s;e times! But the propo&s;er &s;eems not to be aware, that this mode of <HI>'explaining ancient &s;tatutes'</HI> is exactly &s;imilar to one of the mo&s;t gro&s;s and delu&s;ive practices of <HI>popery!</HI> The apo&s;tate church of Rome, for obvious rea&s;ons, cannot &s;ubmit the determination of what ought to be e&s;teemed <HI>apo&s;tolic doctrine</HI> to the evidence of <HI>apo&s;tolic
<PB N="6" REF="5">times;</HI> and, of cour&s;e, &s;he is driven to this wretched &s;ubterfuge of re|ferring for evidence (in favour of her <HI>innovations</HI> and un&s;criptural prac|tices) to the traditions of <HI>more modern times,</HI> and to the <HI>practices</HI> and <HI>opinions</HI> of per&s;ons who lived from 200 to 400 years afterwards; in or|der to invalidate <HI>all cotemporary evidence</HI> of <HI>facts</HI> and <HI>primitive u&s;ages.</HI> &mdash; And &s;urely this di&s;hone&s;t and arbitrary mode of <HI>'&s;ettling doubts'</HI> is e|qually unju&s;tifiable in <HI>legal</HI> and <HI>political,</HI> as in <HI>religious,</HI> que&s;tions. Yet Mr. Hat&s;ell boldly ventures to tell us that, <Q><HI>where the expre&s;&s;ions of acts of parliament,</HI></Q> (&s;peaking of the acts of Edward,) <Q><HI>pa&s;&s;ed above</HI> FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO, <HI>are</HI> DOUBTFUL,</Q> (&s;ays he, though the contrary is evident,) <Q><HI>nothing can clear up and &s;ettle the&s;e</HI> DOUBTS <HI>but the</HI> OPINION <HI>of all the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t-informed per&s;ons,</HI></Q> &amp;c. <Q><HI>from the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth to the pre&s;ent time.</HI></Q> (P. 198, n.) Thus, even the commencement of the time, here propo&s;ed as <HI>the be&s;t</HI> for afford|ing information, is actually more than two hundred years AFTER <HI>the times</HI> in which the acts were made; and he cuts off all <HI>cotemporary,</HI> as well as <HI>intermediate, evidence,</HI> by a &s;ingle bold a&s;&s;ertion, that <Q><HI>nothing can clear up &mdash;but,</HI></Q> &amp;c. taking care to &s;ecure to him&s;elf the ample &s;pace of ano|ther two hundred years, (&s;till more di&s;tant from <HI>the times</HI> in que&s;tion,) that he may range more &s;ecurely in his &s;earch for <HI>precedents</HI> of innova|tions both in <HI>practice</HI> and <HI>opinion.</HI> And indeed he has mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;played the <HI>practices</HI> of the Stuarts, reminding us, in the cour&s;e of argument, even of <HI>'intermi&s;&s;ions of parliaments'</HI> for &s;everal years toge|ther: &mdash; <HI>'an intermi&s;&s;ion of Parliament of &s;ix years,'</HI> by K.

The&s;e were &s;urely mo&s;t unpropitious times for <HI>parliamentary knowledge;</HI> and Mr. Hat&s;ell does not &s;eem to be aware, that the fear of &s;imilar <HI>intermi&s;&s;ions</HI> was probably the principal cau&s;e which withheld the patriots of tho&s;e days from urging their <HI>election-rights</HI> at a time when the &s;um total of all their <HI>rights</HI> was at &s;take, even <HI>the right to have any parliament at all!</HI> &s;o that their <HI>&s;ilence</HI> re&s;pecting <HI>annua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> elections</HI> does not at all a&s;&s;i&s;t Mr. Hat&s;ell's argument again&s;t them. &mdash; The people of England, in tho&s;e times, were rendered &s;o deplorably <HI>abject,</HI> by the <HI>unlimited,</HI> and therefore <HI>illegal,</HI> rule of <HI>Tudors</HI> and <HI>Stuarts</HI> that it was con&s;idered as a crime, in the preceding reign of James I even to urge the expediency of calling a parliament at all: &mdash; <Q><HI>I would fain know the man that dur&s;t per&s;uade the king unto it,</HI></Q> &mdash; &s;ays THE MI+NISTER OF STATE in Sir Walter Rawleigh's Dialogue on the <HI>Prero+gative of Parliaments,</HI> (p. 2.) &s;o that this was undoubtedly the language of <HI>tho&s;e times</HI> to which Mr. Hat&s;ell has referred us for <HI>acts, opinions</HI> and <HI>&s;peeches,</HI> whereby (with the addition of &s;ome &s;till more modern in formation) he thinks <Q><HI>the true intent and meaning of the words u&s;ed in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tatutes of Edward</HI> III,</Q> (though made almo&s;t 300 years before) <Q><HI>migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be be&s;t explained:</HI></Q> but, to look for explanatory <HI>'opinions'</HI> and <HI>'&s;peeche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;</HI> in &s;uch arbitrary times, when men dared not to <HI>&s;peak</HI> their <HI>opinions</HI> upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;ubject, is too great an ab&s;urdity! &s;o that Mr. Hat&s;ell is peculiarl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unfortunate in fixing his aera for <HI>parliamentary information.</HI> And ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> if <HI>'the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t-informed men'</HI> of tho&s;e times had &s;hewn a littl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P>I am far more willing to attribute &s;uch an unaccountable argument to <HI>inattention,</HI> and a <HI>&s;uperficial manner of writing,</HI> than to &s;u&s;pect any <HI>rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de&s;ign</HI> of the ingenious author to promote a mode of <HI>explaining ancient &s;tatutes</HI> &s;o dangerou&s;ly pre&s;umptuous and arbitrary! And, to ju&s;tify the more moderate conclu&s;ion of the two, he has luckily furni&s;hed me with an ea&s;y and obvious proof of it in the very next chapter but one, to which he has given the running title of&mdash; <Q><HI>King adjourns the Parlia|ment,</HI></Q> &mdash; <HI>'King adjourns the Parliament,'</HI> &mdash; for &s;everal pages together, (i. e. from 204 to 211.) &s;o that that one would naturally &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>he really meant what he had &s;o often written:</HI> but, at length, (though not till the very la&s;t page of that head,) he kindly guards us again&s;t that baneful error by an explicit &s;tating of what HE HIMSELF believes to be <Q><HI>the true parliamentary doctrine,</HI></Q> viz. <Q><HI>That the king has no authority to adjourn the parliament;</HI></Q> and, of cour&s;e, his <HI>'&s;uperficial manner'</HI> of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf (I mean on this particular head) mu&s;t be corrected, in his next edition, to <HI>'the true parliamentary doctrine,'</HI> &mdash; <Q><HI>King does</HI> NOT <HI>adjourn the Parliament:</HI> &mdash;</Q> &s;o that he mu&s;t put <HI>a negative</HI> upon his pre&s;ent <HI>title</HI> throughout all the&s;e pages!</P>
<P>But, to return to my &s;ubject, I tru&s;t that the nece&s;&s;ity of at lea&s;t ONE SITTING of the parliament every year, and of our <HI>national right</HI> to &s;uch SITTING, is &s;o &s;ufficiently under&s;tood and acknowledged, by the majo|rity even of <HI>all parties,</HI> that THE CONTRARY DOCTRINE, which ari&s;es too apparently from Mr. Hat&s;ell's <HI>manner of treating</HI> the king's prerogative on that &s;ubject, will need no particular refutation: and yet &s;o re&s;pectable is the authority of the writer, (not only by his office of <HI>clerk of the hou&s;e of commons,</HI> but al&s;o by the per&s;onal e&s;teem which is certainly due to him from a very numerous and re&s;pectable body of friends and acquaintance,) that I thought my&s;elf obliged to take &s;ome notice of <HI>his manner of treating</HI> the &s;ubject before us, in order to warn the public again&s;t <HI>a po&s;&s;ible</HI> con&s;truction of it which might hereaf|ter (if not &s;ea&s;onably cen&s;ured) have dangerous con&s;equences. At the &s;ame time I &s;incerely profe&s;s, that my cen&s;ure is aimed more at this gentleman's <HI>manner of writing</HI> than his <HI>intention,</HI> and that I am much more willing to believe that <HI>the opinion he intended</HI> to expre&s;s was truly what Mr. Lofft has <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed;</HI> or that I my&s;elf may perhaps be mi&s;ta|ken in conceiving that his words are liable to a different con&s;truction; rather than to &s;u&s;pect that the worthy clerk of the hou&s;e of com|mons could <HI>really intend</HI> to favour a doctrine which is repugnant to the e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>u&s;age of parliament</HI> for near a century, and is <HI>equally</HI> inimical to the ju&s;t privileges of the <HI>Lords</HI> as to tho&s;e of the <HI>Commons,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, to the welfare of the <HI>whole nation.</HI></P>
