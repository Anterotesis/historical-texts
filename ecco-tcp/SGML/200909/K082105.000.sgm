<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE History, and Present State of China, as far as relates to its government, its sciences, and its arts, has long been considered worthy of the deepest research; and much information has been collected on these subjects, with considerable labour and expence, under the auspices of several of the most powerful courts in Europe. If the natural productions of that country have attracted less attention, it is only because their value and importance are less generally known; upon better acquaintance they would at once excite our astonishment, and convince us of their utility.</P>
<P>General readers are sometimes disposed to consider the Insect World as too minute and fri|volous to deserve investigation. Let them remember, however, that to a foreign Insect the staple commodity of this kingdom is indebted for its richest dye; that from another we derive the most costly articles of dress, and splendid ornaments of luxury; and the utility of many others is appa|rent in various branches of medicine, the arts, and domestic economy.</P>
<P>Prompted by these reflections, the Author determined to submit to the Public a Series of En|gravings illustrative of the Entomology of China.&mdash;But flattering as the prospect of encourage|ment to his project appeared, he would not presume to publish his Work till the result of the late Embassy of Earl Macartney to that country was fully known: of that the public are now in pos|session; and, though, in common with every friend to the commercial advantages and scientific inquiries of this country, the Author must regret its issue, it is perhaps, on the whole, more favourable to the present Publication than if the event had been different. If indeed a more general intercourse had been established between the two nations, and the language of China had been better understood, it is impossible to calculate the advantages which Entomology, amongst other sciences, might have derived; for the Chinese, like their neighbours the Japanese, are well acquainted with the natural productions of their empire, and Zoology and Botany, in particular, are favourite studies amongst them. To what degree of excellence they have arrived in their scientific researches we are not informed, but we must not affect to despise the instruction of a people amongst whom the most useful arts, and sciences, first dawned and acquired a high degree of perfection, when "Europe had scarcely a few savages scattered over her forests."</P>
<P>The few, but interesting hints, which Sir George Staunton has given on the practical Ento|mology of China, induces us to look forward to a period when some of the Insects, as well as Plants, of that vast empire may be no less objects of curiosity, than of national utility and im|portance; the Chinese Cochineal Insect<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dr. Anderson has found eight species of Cocci at Madras. One of these, he says, was found on a young citron-tree, Citrus Sinensis, just landed from China; it was more deeply intersected between the alxlominal rings than any of tho&s;e of the coast, and he names it therefore C. Diacopeis.&mdash;<HI>Collection of Letters from Madras, Jan.</HI> 28, 1788.&mdash;The Cactus Cochinilifer has lately been found by Mr. Kincaid, at Canton; its Chine&s;e name is <HI>Pau wang.</HI>&mdash;This has been transmitted to the <HI>Nopalry</HI> of the Hon. East India Company, at Madras, and promises to be of future advantage to the commercial concerns of Great Britain. We have been unable to procure any of the Chinese Cochineal insects, and purposely omit that species which Sir G. Staunton has noticed, because it has no relation to the productions of China.</NOTE> and that from which the wax of the cast is procured, 
<PB REF="3">are two species that deserve particular attention. The medical precepts of the Chinese will cer|tainly find few votaries in Europe, but as articles of medicine, amongst others, the Meloe Ci|chorei, which were the cantharides of the ancients, and are now used by the Chinese, may be of importance, as it possesses more virtues than the Meloe Vesicatorius used in our pharmacy: the Curculio regalis, Buprestis vittata, and many others, are also employed in articles of jewellery in the eastern parts of the world, and may vie with the richest gems in beauty and splendour.</P>
<P>These observations we presumed to offer on the Entomology of China, in submitting the Design of this undertaking to the public. We have solicitously endeavoured to gratify the cu|riosity and expectation such observations were calculated to excite, and trust not altogether un|successfully. On the economical purposes of the Chinese Insects we can offer little except con|jectures; those may, however, assist the inquiries of future observers; and the general reader will not be disposed to regard it with less favour, if novelty and beauty supply the deficiency of useful information. It embraces, in one view, a variety of the most uncommon and brilliant species of that fertile region, portrayed in an elegant and faithful manner; and classically arranged accord|ing to the favourite system of <HI>Linnaeus.</HI> Thus, whilst our Epitome of the Chinese Insects ex|hibits a splendid display of this beauteous race, it may insensibly lead to a comprehensive survey of the system itself; and, by conveying instruction in its most pleasing form, facilitate the study of this charming, but much neglected science.</P>
<P>From its commencement, the Author has been encouraged by the liberal attention of several persons, whose names would reflect honour on this undertaking, were he at liberty to mention them. He has already observed that his own collection includes several thousand specimens, collected by amateurs of the first celebrity<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The late Duchess Dowager of Portland, &mdash;Tunstall, Esq. Governor Holford, Smeethman, Ellis, Keate, Yeats, Forster, Baily, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></NOTE>. To this he may add, that every other collection he was desirous of consulting, has been kindly open to his inspection; and every information com|municated with a readiness that merits his warmest thanks. Amongst these, he cannot refrain noticing the valuable collection of Drawings and MSS before alluded to; the specimens of In|sects collected in the journey of his Excellency Earl MACARTNEY, in the late embassy to China; and the very magnificent collections of Mr. FRANCILLON and Mr. DRURY, from both of whom he had unreserved permission to figure and describe whatever his own cabinet could not furnish. And, finally, he must own himself particularly indebted to the favours of the Right Hon. Sir J. BANKS, Bart. K. B. whose invaluable cabinet and library have afforded him every assistance in completing his design, and for which he begs leave to testify his most grate|ful acknowledgments.</P>

<P>S. Molo&s;&s;us and S. Bucephalus are very common in China. The fir&s;t &s;eems a local &s;pecies, the latter is &s;aid to be found in other parts of the Ea&s;t Indies. <HI>Olivier</HI> has given three varieties of Scarabaeus Molo&s;&s;us. The &s;pecimen figured in the annexed plate is the <HI>var. c.</HI> of that author.</P>
<P>The larvae of the larger kinds of coleopterous in&s;ects, abounding in unctuous moi&s;ture, are not le&s;s e&s;teemed as food among &s;ome modern nations, than they were by the epicures of antiquity. In Jamaica, and other i&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies, the Macokko<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prionus damicornis. <HI>Fab. Ent. Sy&s;t.</HI>&mdash; Cerambyx damicornis. <HI>Linn. Mant.</HI></NOTE> larva is an article of luxurious food; and in China mo&s;t in&s;ects in that &s;tate are appropriated to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Thus al&s;o the Romans introduced the larvae of the Lucani<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Stag beetles.</NOTE> and Cerambyes<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Capricorn, or Goat beetles.</NOTE> in their voluptuous repa&s;ts; previou&s;ly feeding them on farinaceous &s;ub&s;tances to give con&s;i&s;tence to the animal juices.</P>
<P>The learned author of the la&s;t account we have of China, &s;ays, "Under the roots of the canes is found a large white grub, which being fried in oil is eaten as a dainty by the Chine&s;e." Perhaps this is the larva of Scarabaeus Molo&s;&s;us, which, like many other of the Scarabaei,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The larvae of the Scarabaei live in the trunks of decayed trees, in putrid and filthy animal &s;ub&s;tances, or in the earth. The la&s;t are the mo&s;t injurious, becau&s;e they de&s;troy the roots of plants. All the known kinds of the&s;e larvae are of an unwieldy form, and whiti&s;h colour, the &s;kin free from hairs, and only the head and &s;ore feet defended with a &s;helly covering.</NOTE> may live &s;edentary in the ground, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the roots of plants: the general de&s;cription and abundance of this in&s;ect in China favours &s;uch opinion. The &s;ame author ob&s;erves, in another part of his work, that "the aurelias of the &s;ilk worm which is cultivated in China, after the &s;ilk is wound off, furni&s;h an article for the table." This al&s;o is a very ancient cu&s;tom among the A&s;iatics, and even Europeans, before the &s;ixteenth century, if we may credit Aldrovandus:<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The German &s;oldiers &s;ometimes fry and eat &s;ilk worms. <HI>Aldrov.</HI></NOTE> it is certain the worms, if not the aurelias, were admini&s;tered in medicine in early ages,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Silk worms dried, powdered, and put on the crown of the head, help the <HI>vertigo</HI> and <HI>convul&s;ions;</HI> mundify or clean&s;e the blood, &amp;c. &amp;c. <HI>Schroderus, Serapio, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>Scarabaeus Sacer is a native of China; it is al&s;o found in other parts of the Ea&s;t Indies, in Egypt, Bar|bary, the Cape of Good Hope, and other countries of Africa, and throughout the &s;outh of Europe.</P>
<P>A few remains of ancient monuments, and &s;ome fragments of hi&s;toric information, pre&s;erved from an early period of the world, afford certain and intere&s;ting details of this incon&s;iderable creature. Tho&s;e remains evince indeed but the fir&s;t dawning of natural and moral philo&s;ophy on the human mind, but, connected with the hi&s;tory of the in&s;ect before us, are too important to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The Scarabaeus was held in profound veneration by the people of Egypt.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The &s;pecies wor&s;hipped by the Egyptians is preci&s;ely noted by Linnaeus. <HI>Scarabaeus &s;acer:</HI> and al&s;o by Olivier. <HI>Scarab&eacute; &s;acr&eacute;.</HI> "Cet in&s;ecte &eacute;toit autrefois en veneration en Egypt." <HI>Oliv.</HI></NOTE> They regarded it as a vi&s;ible deity; but a more refined &s;y&s;tem of religious wor&s;hip prevailed in their temples among the prie&s;ts and &s;ages.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">E&s;chenbach, Jablou&s;ki, Savary, &amp;c.</NOTE> They deemed it only the &s;ymbol of their god, and, a&s;cribing both &s;exes to the <HI>Scarab,</HI> it became a &s;triking emblem of a &s;elf-created and &s;upreme fir&s;t cau&s;e.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">"The father, mother, male and female art thou." <HI>Syne&s;ius. Hymn. Phtha.</HI>&mdash;"The Egyptian &s;pirit <HI>Phtha</HI> gave chaos form, and then created all things." <HI>Jamblichus de My&s;teriis, &s;ect.</HI> 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>This in&s;ect was more e&s;pecially the &s;ymbol of their god Neith,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neith.</HI> The di&s;po&s;er of all things, &amp;c. <HI>Jablon&s;ki.</HI> "Sais," of the Delta, "the capital of its di&s;trict, is a con&s;iderable city, of which Ama&s;is was king. <HI>Neith,</HI> the Minerva of the Greeks, is the titular divinity." <HI>Plato in Timaeo.</HI>&mdash; "On the door of the temple of <HI>Neith</HI> was engraved in hieroglyphics, 'I am what is, what was, what &s;hall be; mortal has never rai&s;ed my veil; the &s;un is the fruit of my womb." <HI>Proclus Commentary on the Timaeus of Plato,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages demon&s;trate Neith and Phtha to be two attributes of one &s;pirit. The third attribute is Cneph, or divine goodne&s;s. <HI>Savary.</HI></NOTE> who&s;e attribute was power &s;upreme in governing the works of creation, and who&s;e glory was increa&s;ed, rather than dimini&s;hed, by the pre&s;ence of a &s;uperior being, <HI>Phtha,</HI> the creator. The theological definition of the two powers being independent, yet centering in one &s;pirit, is implied by the figurative union of two &s;exes in the Scarab. In the latter &s;en&s;e it &s;ignified therefore but one omnipotent power. The Scarab, typifying Neith, was carved or painted on a
<PB REF="7">ring, and worn by the &s;oldiers, as a token of homage to that power who di&s;po&s;ed of the fate of battles;<NOTE N="l">Authors quote a doubtful pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Herapollo Hieroglyph. lib.</HI> 1. to &s;upport this opinion. That &s;uch rings were worn by the ancient Egyptians is beyond conjecture, many remains of them, and &s;ome very perfect, have been found in the &s;ubterranean caverns and &s;epulchres in the Plain of Mummies near Saccara and Giza. Tho&s;e which we have examined, are remarkable for the convexity, or full <HI>relievo</HI> of the figure &s;culptured on them, in &s;ome it is of the natural &s;ize of the in&s;ect, but generally &s;maller; the &s;tone, cornelian, without a rim, and turning on a &s;wivel ring of gold.</NOTE> and &s;culptured on a&s;tronomical tables, or on columns,<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus &s;ays the Scarabaeus facer is &s;culptured on the antique Egyptian columns in Rome. "Hic in columnis antiquis Romae ex&s;culptus ab Aegyptiis." <HI>Sy&s;t. Nat.</HI> Does Linnaeus allude to any remains of tho&s;e colo&s;&s;al obeli&s;ks, which Augu&s;tus tran&s;|ported to Rome when he &s;ubjugated Egypt, or others of more recent date? It would increa&s;e the intere&s;t of our enquiries, to learn, that the Scarabaeus was among the hieroglyphics, on the two very ancient obeli&s;ks, carried from Heliopolis, the city of the Sun.
<P>The indefinite and vi&s;ionary interpretations, impo&s;ed on mo&s;t Egyptian hieroglyphics through a long &s;eries of ages, will barely &s;upport a few conjectures on their original &s;ignification. Tho&s;e which related to local incidents, hi&s;tory, or the arts, are veiled in profound ob&s;curity. The phaenomena of nature, and a&s;tronomical calculations, in&s;cribed in tho&s;e characters, are &s;carcely better under&s;tood, though the knowledge of tho&s;e &s;ciences have been in part handed down to us from the learned Egyptians in remote ages. We are informed by ancient writers, that the Scarabaeus engraved on the a&s;tronomical tables of the&s;e people, implied the divine Wi&s;dom which governed the motion and order of the cele&s;tial bodies; that tho&s;e tables were huge and ma&s;&s;y &s;tones, or columns of granite, with the characters and figures, large, and highly embo&s;&s;ed; in &s;hort, &s;uch as were &s;uppo&s;ed capa|ble of long re&s;i&s;tance to the corroding hand of time. Among tho&s;e the Scarab was probably the mo&s;t con&s;picuous, its &s;ize gigantic, and the figure frequently repeated; for this we have ob&s;erved, even on &s;mall Egyptian antiques.</P>
<P>Various valuable remains of tablets, with figures of the <HI>Scarabaeus &s;acer,</HI> are pre&s;erved in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum and other col|lections of antiquities in this country. Tho&s;e we have examined are of various de&s;criptions, &s;ome &s;maller than the in&s;ect it&s;elf, others of a mon&s;trous &s;ize. The &s;tones on which they are &s;culptured generally <HI>green nephritic</HI> or <HI>jade &s;tone,</HI> or a kind of <HI>ba&s;altes,</HI> and black marble; the figure <HI>ba&s;&s;o relievo,</HI> on a tablet or &s;lab, but oftener in <HI>relievo,</HI> with the prominent characters of the in&s;ect very accurately defined, particularly the &s;ix dentations of the clypeo, and tho&s;e of the tibiae. The rever&s;e of the embo&s;&s;ed &s;ide is flat and &s;mooth, and abounds in characters altogether unknown, though, from the number of religious objects of wor&s;hip occa&s;ionally inter&s;per&s;ed, we may pre&s;ume they contain an ample &s;tore of the ancient &s;acerdotal language: the mo&s;t remarkable were the &s;carab, the &s;ceptre and eye,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>O&s;yris,</HI> or the &s;un.</NOTE> the human figure with a dog's head,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Anubis.</NOTE> the hawk,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Horus,</HI> a famous deity, had three cities dedicated, called by the Greeks the cities of <HI>Apollo.</HI></NOTE> and the Ibis,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The mummies of the&s;e birds are found in urns, in the &s;ubterranean galleries called the well of birds near <HI>Sacc..ra,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed from the &s;ize to be the Tantalus Ibis of Linnaeus.</NOTE> or &s;acred bird. On the thorax of one fine &s;pecimen we remarked four elegant figures. One of them is holding a <HI>cornucopia</HI> in the left hand, and a branch in the right: this is perhaps a &s;ubordinate deity of the Nile, that river having been once found depictured on an an|tique Alexandrian coin, like an aged man, holding the cornucopia, and a branch of the Papyrus; denoting its abundance and produce.</P>
<P>The digre&s;&s;ion on the mythological hi&s;tory of this in&s;ect may be con&s;idered by &s;ome as a tedious deviation from the pur&s;uit of the naturali&s;t; with others we tru&s;t it will be more favourably received; for it proves to the unprejudiced mind how deeply the hi&s;tory of nature, and in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance the &s;cience of Entomology, involves a mo&s;t important enquiry into the fir&s;t philo&s;ophical opinions of the human race. The means, however trifling, mu&s;t not be contemned, which illumine the mo&s;t &s;ublime of all human re&s;earches,&mdash;<HI>The Study of Mankind.</HI></P></NOTE> it expre&s;&s;ed the divine wi&s;dom which regulates the uni|ver&s;e and enlightens man.</P>

<P>The Bupre&s;tides form an exten&s;ive, and mo&s;t brilliant tribe of coleopterous in&s;ects. Bra&s;il and New Holland produce &s;ome gigantic &s;pecies, but none more beautiful than tho&s;e of India. We need adduce no other proof of this, than Bupre&s;tis chry&s;is, &s;ternicorus, attenuata, ocellata, and vittata.

The Bupre&s;tis vittata in particular, is much admired among them. It is, we believe, entirely peculiar to China, where it is found in va&s;t abundance, and di&s;tributed from thence at a low price among the other Indians. The Chine&s;e, who always profit by the curio&s;ity of Europeans, collect va&s;t quantities of this Bupre&s;tis, and other gay in&s;ects, in the interior of the country, and traffic with them.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable error &s;eems to have ari&s;en concerning this &s;pecies, and the true Bupre&s;tis ignita of Lin|naeus. All authors, except Fabricius and Olivier, have con&s;idered the Bupre&s;tis vittata, and ignita, the &s;ame. Fabricius, in his <HI>Species In&s;ectorum,</HI> refers to <HI>Mu&s;. Dom. Banks</HI> only, for the Bupre&s;tis vittata; and to the 14th figure, plate 6, in <HI>Sulzer</HI>'s work, for a figure of Bupre&s;tis ignita. In the <HI>Entomologia Sy&s;tematica</HI> we however find the &s;ame reference to the figure of <HI>Sulzer,</HI> for B. vittata<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Vol. 1. part 2. p. 186. 5.</NOTE>; and, to increa&s;e the perplexity, preci&s;ely the &s;ame reference under that of B. ignita<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Vol. 1. part 2. p. 192. 28.</NOTE> al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB REF="24">The Bupre&s;tis ignita of Linnaeus, we imagined, was unknown in the cabinets of the curious in this country, till we di&s;covered an in&s;ect nearly corre&s;ponding in character with it, in the collection of Mr. Drury, and which we pre&s;ume is the B. ignita, or at lea&s;t a variety of it. It has not the brilliance of colours that &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hes B. vittata, but in form and &s;ize it agrees with it. The only figure of that &s;pecies is given by Olivier, from a &s;pecimen formerly in the cabinet of Gigot d'Orcy, of Paris. We have exa|mined the &s;pecimen in the cabinet of Sir J.

<P>Fabricius has given as a part of the &s;pecific di&s;tinction of the&s;e in&s;ects, that B. ignita has <HI>three &s;pines</HI> at the end of each wing ca&s;e, or elytron, and B. vittata no more than <HI>two.</HI> This may form a &s;ufficient cha|racteri&s;tic in tho&s;e &s;pecies; but we mu&s;t remark, that it is not &s;o in Bupre&s;tis ocellata.

As the characters of the&s;e Fabrician genera are taken from the palpi, maxilla, and labium, we prefer the more obvious characters of the Linnaean genus.</P>
<P>The figures quoted by Fabricius differ, in &s;ome re&s;pects, from the Chine&s;e, &s;pecimens. Sulzer repre|&s;ents it of a green colour, without a tinge of red purple, or copper colour, &s;o predominant in every &s;pe|cimen we have &s;een. Our in&s;ects are of two kinds: one is of a glowing purple, re&s;plendent as metal, and changeable to green or yellow; the other is purple al&s;o, but not quite &s;o vivid, being tinged with green.</P>

<P>The Cantharides of the ancients, are by no means to be confounded with tho&s;e of medical writers in the la&s;t century. By the term Cantharides, in an European <HI>Pharmacopeia,</HI> we under&s;tand the Meloe ve&s;icatorius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Geoffroy calls this a Cantharis. The Linnaean Cantharis is a di&s;tinct genus.</NOTE> of Linnaeus, an in&s;ect who&s;e medicinal properties are very generally known<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Applied externally to rai&s;e bli&s;ters. It is a violent poi&s;on taken inwardly, except in &s;mall portions.</NOTE>. The Cantharides of the ancients can &s;carcely be a&s;certained; it was a term indi&s;criminately applied to &s;everal kinds of in&s;ects, and too often without regard to their phy&s;ical virtues. Pliny &s;peaks of the Cantharis as a &s;mall beetle that eats and con&s;umes corn; and of another that breeds in the tops of a&s;hes and wild olives, and &s;hines like gold.

<P>This Mantis is de&s;cribed by Fabricius only. Stoll has given the figure of an in&s;ect not unlike it in his publication; and we have &s;een a &s;pecimen &s;imilar to it, which was found by Profe&s;&s;or Pallas near the Ca&s;pian &s;ea. It is allied to Mantis Gongyloides, a native of Africa and A&s;ia, but bears a clo&s;er affinity to Mantis Pauperata<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Figured by Stoll under the name of <HI>La Mante Goutteu&s;e Brune?</HI></NOTE> from Java, Molucca, and perhaps other i&s;lands in the Indian &s;ea.</P>
<P>Fabricius enumerates fifty-one &s;pecies of this genus in his la&s;t &s;y&s;tem; a con&s;iderable portion of the&s;e are from A&s;ia: had he included the lately di&s;covered kinds in America and New Holland, his genus would have been far more comprehen&s;ive. Few naturali&s;ts have had the opportunity of ob&s;erving the manners of the&s;e creatures in di&s;tant countries; nor can we always rely on the information tho&s;e few have given. Of the European &s;pecies we can &s;peak with more preci&s;ion, becau&s;e &s;ome indefatigable naturali&s;ts have at|tended minutely to them; Roe&s;el in particular has treated at con&s;iderable length on the manners of the Mantis Religio&s;a of Linnaeus.</P>
<P>De&s;criptions can only convey an imperfect idea of the extraordinary appearance of many creatures in|cluded in the Mantis and Locu&s;ta genera. Among them are found &s;pecies that bear a &s;imilitude to the u&s;ual forms of other in&s;ects; but, from the&s;e we almo&s;t imperceptibly de&s;cend to others, bearing as &s;trong a &s;imi|litude to the vegetable part of creation; &s;eeming as if Nature de&s;igned them to unite the appearance of a vegetable with the vital functions of an animal, to pre&s;erve them from the ravages of voracious creatures, or to connect that chain of progre&s;&s;ive and univer&s;al being, which</P>
<Q>" The great directing MIND of ALL ordains."</Q>
<P>Many of the&s;e creatures a&s;&s;ume &s;o exactly the appearance of the leaves of different trees, that they fur|nish
<PB REF="33">the entomologi&s;t with unerring &s;pecific di&s;tinctions; thus we have <HI>L. citrifolia, laurifolia, myrtifolia, oleifolia, graminifolia,</HI> and others, equally expre&s;&s;ive of their re&s;emblance in form, and colours, to the leaves of tho&s;e re&s;pective plants. Travellers in countries that produce the&s;e creatures, have been &s;truck with the phaenomenon, as it mu&s;t appear, of animated vegetable &s;ub&s;tances; for the manners of the Mantis, in addition to its &s;tructure, are very likely to impo&s;e on the &s;en&s;es of the uninformed. They often remain on the trees for hours without motion, then &s;uddenly &s;pring into the air, and, when they &s;ettle, again appear lifele&s;s. The&s;e are only &s;tratagems to deceive the more cautious in&s;ects which it feeds upon; but &s;ome travellers who have ob&s;erved it, have declared they &s;aw the leaves of tho&s;e trees become living crea|tures, and take flight.</P>
<P>M. Merian informs us of a &s;imilar opinion among the Indians, who believed the&s;e in&s;ects grow like leaves on the trees, and when they were mature, loo&s;ened them&s;elves and crawled, or flew; away. From the credulous, and un&s;cientific, marvellous reports of &s;uch extraordinary creatures may be expected; but, to the&s;e we mu&s;t add the authority of a naturali&s;t, who&s;e works are a valuable addition to our pre&s;ent knowledge of the hi&s;tory of nature: the&s;e are the works of Pi&s;o<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gulielmi Pi&s;onis, Am&s;terl. <HI>1657.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e little animals," &s;ays that author, "change into a green and tender plant, which is of two hands breadth. The feet are fixed into the ground fir&s;t; from the&s;e, when nece&s;&s;ary humidity is attracted, roots grow out, and &s;trike into the ground; thus they change by degrees, and in a &s;hort time become a perfect plant. Sometimes only the lower part takes the nature and form of a plant, while the upper part remains as before, living and moveable: after &s;ome time the animal is gradually converted into a plant. In this Nature &s;eems to operate in a circle, by a continual retrograde motion."</P>
<P>Has the father of inventive romance outdone this account of Pi&s;o in his well-known extravagant poetical effu&s;ions<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Luna quater junctis impl&ecirc;rat cornibus orbem, &amp;c. OVIDII Metamorph. &mdash;<HI>Sorores Pha&euml;thontis in Arbores.</HI>

<P>We quote this part of the poem at length; for as we peru&s;e it, every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive line, bears a &s;tronger &s;imilitude to the wonderful transformation of the Mantis as related by <HI>Pi&s;o;</HI> we might be almo&s;t tempted to condemn the de&s;cription of the naturali&s;t as a &s;ervile copy of Ovid's ver&s;es, if the &s;imilar transformation of other in&s;ects above noticed, had not occurred to the knowledge of every entomologi&s;t.</P></NOTE>? It may be imagined he has not; but before we di&s;mi&s;s his account with a ha&s;ty
<PB REF="34">cen&s;ure, let us attend to the opinion of a few authors, nearly contemporary with him&s;elf: we find the&s;e collected in the critici&s;ms of Roe&s;el on that pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>From the&s;e it appears that the works of Pi&s;o were much admired when fir&s;t publi&s;hed, but we rely le&s;s implicitly on the information it contains, than his readers in the la&s;t century. Roe&s;el treats his account with more than merited &s;everity; not becau&s;e he could contradict the relation of Pi&s;o, but, becau&s;e he had never ob&s;erved the &s;ame circum&s;tance attend the Wandering Leaf, or Mantis Oratoria, in Europe<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Among the annotations on the la&s;t edition of Roe&s;el's <HI>In&s;ecten Bellu&s;tigung</HI> we find one relating to this part of the works of Pi&s;o. "<HI>Der &s;eel Her geheime Rath Trew, &amp;c.</HI> Coun&s;. Trew a&s;&s;ures Mr. Roe&s;el that <HI>Pi&s;o</HI> not only very often gave out the credible ob&s;ervations of others, as his own, but him&s;elf believed the mo&s;t incredible relations, and pretended to be an eye witne&s;s thereof." We quote this in ju&s;tice to the remarks of Roe&s;el. <HI>Note in page</HI> 10, <HI>&s;ection Das Wandlende Blat.</HI></NOTE>. This rea&s;oning is neither &s;o conclu&s;ive, or liberal, as we &s;hould expect from Roe&s;el; and more e&s;pecially as he afterwards de&s;cribes even the fir&s;t &s;ymptom of the transformation as related by Pi&s;o. When he &s;peaks of the death of the European &s;pecies his words are, "As their di&s;&s;olution approaches, their green eyes become brown, and they unavoidably lo&s;e their &s;ight: they remain a long while on the &s;ame &s;pot, till at la&s;t they fall quite exhau&s;ted and powerle&s;s, as if a&s;leep." What is this but &s;ub&s;tantiating part of the evi|dence of Pi&s;o, which he has laboured before to di&s;credit? As to the change after they remained long on the ground, &s;uch as &s;ending forth fibres, roots, and &s;tems, from the body of the in&s;ect, it is only a&s;toni&s;hing &s;uch a well-informed naturali&s;t &s;hould have deemed it matter of &s;urpri&s;e. Could he be ignorant of the many in&s;tances that occur, of animal &s;ub&s;tances producing plants<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Such as Mucor cru&s;taceus, &amp;c.</NOTE>? or was lie not informed that the pupa which commonly &s;ends forth a bee, a wa&s;p, or cicada; has &s;ometimes become the nidus of a plant, thrown up &s;tems from the fore part of the head, and changed in every re&s;pect into a vegetable, though &s;till re|taining the &s;hell and exterior appearance of the parent in&s;ect at the root<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Specimens of the&s;e vegetated animals, are frequently brought from the We&s;t Indies; we have one of the cicada from the pupa, as well as others produced from wa&s;ps and bees in the perfect or winged &s;late. Mr. Drury has a beetle in the perfect &s;late, from every part of which, &s;mall &s;talks and &s;ibies have &s;prouted forth; they are very different from the tufts of hair that are ob&s;erved on a few coleopterous in&s;ects, &s;uch as the Bupre&s;tis &s;a&s;cicularis, of the Cape of Good Hope; they are certainly a vegetable production.</NOTE>? We own at fir&s;t &s;ight with Roe&s;el that the account of Pi&s;o &s;eems " an inattentive and confounded ob&s;ervation," but that an in&s;ect may &s;trike root into the earth, and, from the co-operation of heat, and moi&s;ture, congenial to vegetation, produce a plant of the <HI>cryptogamia</HI> kind, cannot be di&s;puted. We have &s;een &s;pecies of <HI>clavaria</HI> both of the undivided and branched kinds, four times larger than the in&s;ect from which they &s;prang; and can we then deny that the in&s;ect mentioned by Pi&s;o might not produce a plant of a proportionate magnitude? In &s;hort, are we &s;o well acquainted with the productions of Bra&s;il as to contradict any of his a&s;&s;ertions, concerning this transformation? Pi&s;o does not &s;ay of what kind this vegetable was; it mu&s;t &s;urely be of the fungi
<PB REF="35">kind: rea&s;oning then from analogy, it might be an unknown &s;pecies of <HI>clavaria</HI> with numerous and &s;preading branches; and, finally, the colour of his plant, on which authors lay much &s;tre&s;s, might be green, though a colour not &s;o predominant in that tribe of vegetables as &s;ome others.</P>
<P>The large&s;t and mo&s;t intere&s;ting of the Indian &s;pecies of Mantis is found in the i&s;le of Amboyna. Stoll contradicts the account of <HI>Renard</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Poi&s;&s;ons des Molucques par M. Renard, Am&s;terl. 1754.</NOTE>, who &s;ays the&s;e creatures are &s;ometimes thirteen inches in length; but we have a &s;pecimen almo&s;t of that &s;ize. It is related by Renard, and others, that the larger kinds of Mantes go in va&s;t troops, cro&s;s hills, rivers, and other ob&s;tacles that oppo&s;e their march, when they are in que&s;t of food. If they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted entirely on vegetables, a troop of the&s;e voracious creatures would de&s;olate the land in their excur&s;ions; but they prefer in&s;ects, and clear the earth of myriads that infe&s;t it: if the&s;e become &s;carce from their ravages, they fight and devour one another. When they attack the plants, they do great mi&s;chief. It is &s;aid of &s;ome Locu&s;ts and Mantes that the plants they bite wither, and appear as if &s;corched with fire: we have not heard of this pe&s;tilential property in any of the larger &s;pecies of Mantes.</P>
<P>Of the &s;maller kinds, the Mantis Oratoria is the mo&s;t widely diffu&s;ed, being found in Africa and A&s;ia as well as in all the warmer parts of Europe. The&s;e creatures are e&s;teemed &s;acred by the vulgar in many countries, from their devout or &s;upplicating po&s;ture. The Africans wor&s;hip them; and their trivial names in many European languages imply a &s;uper&s;titious re&s;pect for them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Louva Dios by the Portugue&s;e. Pre&s;que Dieu by the French.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>England produces no &s;pecies of this tribe. The entomologi&s;ts in this country mu&s;t con&s;equently rely on the accounts of tho&s;e, who have ob&s;erved them in other parts of the world. We &s;hall &s;elect a few remarks from Roe&s;el's exten&s;ive de&s;cription of Mantis Oratoria and Gongyloides, becau&s;e, if we may pre|&s;ume from the analogy they bear in form to Mantis Flabellicornis, the hi&s;tory of one will clearly elucidate that of the other.</P>
<P>Roe&s;el &s;ays, &s;ome of the Mantes are local in Germany; they are found chiefly in the vintages at Moedting in <HI>Moravia,</HI> where they are called <HI>Weinhandel</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Probably a provincial term for a dealer in wine.</NOTE>. The males die in October, the females &s;oon after<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Goetz, in his Beytrage, ob&s;erves, that they live &s;ometimes ten years.</NOTE>. The young brood are pre&s;erved in the egg &s;tate, in a kind of oblong bag, of a thick &s;pongy &s;ub&s;tance; this bag is imbricated on the out&s;ide; it is fa&s;tened lengthwi&s;e to the branch of &s;ome plant<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">To that of the vine in Mantis Oratoria.</NOTE>. As the eggs ripen they are protruded through the thick &s;ub&s;tance of the bag, and the larva, which are about half an inch in length, bur&s;t from them. Roe&s;el, wi&s;hing to ob&s;erve the gradual progre&s;s of the&s;e creatures, to the winged &s;tate, placed the bag containing the eggs in a large gla&s;s, which he clo&s;ed, to prevent their e&s;cape. From the time they were fir&s;t hatched they exhibited marks of a &s;avage di&s;po&s;ition. He put different &s;orts of plants into the gla&s;s, but they refu&s;ed them, to prey on one another: this determined him to &s;upply them with other in&s;ects to eat: he put <HI>ants</HI> into the gla&s;s to them, but they then betrayed as much cow|ardice,
<PB REF="36">as they had barbarity before; for the in&s;tant the Mantes &s;aw the ants they tried to e&s;cape in every direction. By this Roe&s;el found the ants were the greate&s;t per&s;ecutors of the Mantes. He next gave them &s;ome of the common mu&s;ca (hou&s;e flies), which they &s;eized with eagerne&s;s in their fore claws, and tore in pieces: but, though the&s;e creatures &s;eemed very fond of the flies, they continued to de&s;troy one another through &s;avage wantonne&s;s. De&s;pairing at la&s;t, from their daily decrea&s;e, of rearing any to the winged &s;tate, he &s;eparated them into &s;mall parcels in different gla&s;&s;es; but, here, as before, the &s;tronge&s;t of each community de&s;troyed the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Another time, he received &s;everal pair of Mantes in the winged &s;tate; profiting by his former ob&s;er|vation, he put each pair [a male and female] into a &s;eparate gla&s;s, but they &s;till &s;hewed &s;igns of an eternal enmity towards one another, which neither &s;ex nor age could &s;often; for the in&s;tant they were in &s;ight of each other, they threw up their heads, brandi&s;hed their fore legs, and waited the attack: they did not remain long in this po&s;ture, for the bolde&s;t throwing open its wings, with the velocity of lightning, ru&s;hed at the other, and often tore it in pieces with the crockets and &s;pines of the fore claws. Roe&s;el compares the attack of the&s;e creatures to that of two hu&s;&s;ars; for they dexterou&s;ly guard and cut with the edge of the fore claws, as tho&s;e &s;oldiers do with their &s;abres, and &s;ometimes at a &s;troke, one cleaves the other through, or &s;evers its head from the thorax. After this the conqueror devours his vanqui&s;hed antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>We learn from Roe&s;el al&s;o, the manner in which this creature takes its prey, in which re&s;pect we find it agrees with what is related of the extra European &s;pecies. The patience of this Mantis is remarkable, and the po&s;ture to which &s;uper&s;tition has attributed devotion, is no other, than the means it u&s;es to catch it. When it has fixed its eyes on an in&s;ect, it very rarely lo&s;es &s;ight of it, though it may co&s;t &s;ome hours to take. If it &s;ees the in&s;ect a little beyond its reach, over its head, it &s;lowly erects its long thorax, by means of the moveable membranes that connect it to the body at the ba&s;e; then, re&s;ting on the four po&s;terior legs, it gradually rai&s;es the anterior pair al&s;o; if this brings it near enough to the in&s;ect, it throws open the la&s;t joint, or crocket part, and &s;naps it between the &s;pines, that are &s;et in rows on the &s;econd joint. If it is un&s;ucce&s;sful, it does not retract its arms, but holds them &s;tretched out, and waits again till the in&s;ect is within its reach, when it &s;prings up and &s;eizes it. This is the uncommon po&s;ture before alluded to. Should the in&s;ect go far from the &s;pot, it flies, or crawls after it, &s;lowly on the ground like a cat, and when the in&s;ect &s;tops, erects it&s;elf as before. They have a &s;mall black pupil or &s;ight which moves in all directions within the parts we u&s;ually term the eyes, &s;o that it can &s;ee its prey in any direction without having occa&s;ion to di&s;turb it, by turning its head.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t prevalent colour of this tribe of in&s;ects is fine green, but many of the&s;e fade or become brown after the in&s;ect dies: &s;ome are finely decorated with a variety of vivid hues; the mo&s;t beautiful of the&s;e, that we have &s;een, are from the Moluccas.</P>

<P>The Gryllus morbillo&s;us appears in the early addition of the <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae,</HI> and the works of Roe&s;el, as an Indian &s;pecies: Mr. Drury a&s;&s;ures us he has received it &s;everal times from China. Another &s;ort is
<PB REF="44">al&s;o found at the Cape of Good Hope, which is rather larger and deeper in colour than the Chine&s;e variety.</P>
<P>When this in&s;ect is at re&s;t, the wings are folded, and much of its beauty is concealed: but when the&s;e are expanded, its appearance is altogether magnificent. It has nothing of the &s;hining and metallic &s;plen|dour of the Coleopterae, for its colours are tran&s;lucent, and a&s;&s;ume their riche&s;t hues when they pa&s;s before the light. The elytra are purple, variegated with yellow: the wings of a glowing crim&s;on, &s;potted with black. The abdomen is &s;urrounded with alternate zones of black and yellow, and the legs are throughout of an elegant &s;carlet, inferior only in brightne&s;s to the coral red of the head and thorax. Upon the whole, this &s;pecies is embelli&s;hed with &s;uch a profu&s;ion of various and beautiful colours, that it may be con&s;idered as a mo&s;t &s;plendid example of the Hemipterous order of in&s;ects. It is repre&s;ented on the <HI>Iris Chinen&s;is</HI> in a flying po&s;ition.</P>
<P>This is not &s;uppo&s;ed to be a numerous &s;pecies in China; on the contrary, it is probably uncommon.

<P>The phenomena re&s;ulting from the properties and effects of light, having engaged the attention of the earlie&s;t philo&s;ophers, we mu&s;t conclude, that pho&s;phorical appearances, and tho&s;e e&s;pecially of animated bodies, could not fail to attract their particular notice. Indeed it is evident, from the writings of the ac|curate ob&s;ervers of nature in remote ages, that they were acquainted with certain in&s;ects that have the property of &s;hining in the night. The&s;e were known only by general terms, expre&s;&s;ive of that property; yet it is probable that &s;ome of the Linnaean lampyrides, which are abundant in the &s;outh of Europe, as well as in A&s;ia, and &s;ome parts of Africa, were the fir&s;t of the illuminated in&s;ects known to them<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The lampyris of <HI>Pliny</HI> is expre&s;sly the in&s;ect with a &s;hining tail.</NOTE>. Some of the males which are furni&s;hed with wings, and are illuminated like the &s;emales, were &s;triking objects of natural hi&s;tory, and could &s;carcely have e&s;caped their notice. The Greeks included all &s;hining in&s;ects under the name lampyris; and the Latins called them cicindela, noctiluca, luciola. lucernata, &amp;c. Whether any of the <HI>Fulgorae,</HI> were known to the ancients is uncertain: probably they were not, the mo&s;t remarkable &s;pecies being peculiar to the warme&s;t parts of America.

This brings us to the period in which <HI>Fulgora Candelaria,</HI> our Chine&s;e &s;pecies, was fir&s;t known in Europe: a circum&s;tance of much importance to naturali&s;ts at that time, becau&s;e the fir&s;t mentioned &s;pecies was a &s;olitary example of its &s;ingular genus. The tran&s;actions of the Stockholm academy includes the earlie&s;t figure and de&s;cription of this extraordinary in&s;ect; from the&s;e Linnaeus de&s;cribed it in his <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae;</HI> but his arrangement has undergone many alterations &s;ince that time. At fir&s;t he included it among the Coleopterous in&s;ects; then he called them Lanternariae; and again, they were cla&s;&s;ed with the Cicadae;. The&s;e have been &s;ince corrected, and a new genus formed of in&s;ects with elongated trunks on their foreheads exclu&s;ively, under the name Fulgora, a name that has been adopted by later authors, and finally by Fabricius.</P>
<P>Roe&s;el has given three figures and a de&s;cription of the <HI>Fulgora Candelaria;</HI> from his account we learn that it was known in England before he was acquainted with it. On its peculiar qualities, he ob&s;erves he mu&s;t be entirely &s;ilent, becau&s;e he had been unable to derive any information concerning it; his de&s;cription is notwith&s;tanding extremely prolix, and occupies four quarto pages; as he notices every trifling particular of the &s;pots, colours, &amp;c. of the in&s;ect. We have &s;elected the mo&s;t intere&s;ting pa&s;&s;age, becau&s;e it clearly marks the progre&s;&s;ive advancement of the knowledge of natural hi&s;tory in Europe, &s;o late as the middle of the pre&s;ent century.</P>

Roe&s;el being a re&s;pectable entomological writer of his time, we mu&s;t infer that <HI>Fulgora Candelaria</HI> was extremely &s;carce in Europe when his plate and de&s;criptions were publi&s;hed. The commercial concerns of Europeans with the Chine&s;e having greatly increa&s;ed &s;ince that period, has facilitated many inquiries con|cerning the natural productions of China; and a mong&s;t a variety of other in&s;ects that are now u&s;ually brought from that country, &s;pecimens of Fulgora Candelaria are not uncommon.

<P>Having noticed the &s;everal authors who have treated on this in&s;ect, we come to con&s;ider the peculiar properties of its fingular genus; and among the&s;e we find the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing that in&s;ects can po&s;&s;e&s;s, that of emanating light: not merely a momentary &s;hining appearance, as is produced by many vi&s;cous &s;ub&s;tances, but a clear and con&s;tant re&s;emblance to the element, fire; and capable of diffu&s;ing light to &s;ur-rounding objects, though totally de&s;titute of every principle that can do mi&s;chief.

<P>"Once," &s;ays Madame Merian, "when the Indians brought me a number of the&s;e Lantern carriers, I put them into a wooden box, without being aware of their &s;hining at night; but one night, being awakened by an unu&s;ual noi&s;e, and much frightened, I jumped out of bed, and ordered a light, not knowing whence this noi&s;e proceeded. We &s;oon perceived that it originated in the box, we opened with &s;ome inquietude, but were &s;till more alarmed, after opening it, and letting it fall on the ground, for a <HI>flame</HI> appeared to i&s;&s;ue from it, which &s;eemed to receive additional lu&s;tre, as often as another in&s;ect &s;lew out of it. When we ob&s;erved this &s;ome time, we recovered from our terror, and admired the &s;plendour of the&s;e little animals." <HI>Di&s;&s;ert. de generatione et metamorphibus In&s;ectorum Surinamen&s;is.</HI></P></NOTE> was greatly di&s;credited, though Dr. Grew had related &s;ome &s;urpri&s;ing particulars of a &s;pecimen of it

It is admitted, that the <HI>Chine&s;e Fulgora</HI> has an illuminated appearance in the night. "The foreheads of many Fulgorae (e&s;pecially tho&s;e found in China) emit a lively &s;hining light in the night time, which, according to &s;ome authors, is &s;ufficient to read by."&mdash; <HI>Yeats</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Yeats. In&s;titutions of Entomology.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The light of the Fulgorae is generally imagined to i&s;&s;ue from the trunk, or elongated projection of the forehead; but Roe&s;el offers a conjecture on the light of the Fulgora Lanternaria, which, on further inve&s;|tigation, may enable naturali&s;ts to determine whether the light is entirely produced by an innate property of the trunk, or receives additional &s;plendour from &s;ome external cau&s;e. He notices a white farinaceous &s;ub&s;tance on &s;everal parts of the wings and body, as well as the trunk, which, he ob&s;erves, looks like the decayed wood which &s;hines at night. We mention this conjecture of Roe&s;el, though the &s;ame occurred to us before we peru&s;ed his ob&s;ervations. We have invariably found a &s;imilar white powder on other in&s;ects of this genus, but u&s;ually upon the trunk only. The remarks of Roe&s;el were nece&s;&s;arily very limited, two &s;pecies of the Fulgorae only being then known. We po&s;&s;e&s;s twelve di&s;tinct &s;pecies, and have made di&s;&s;ections and ob&s;ervations on &s;everal others; from all which we are inclined to imagine, that the white powder has a pho&s;phoric appearance in the living in&s;ect, and increa&s;es the light, when the end of the trunk is illu|minated.</P>
<P>One of the Fulgorae of con&s;iderable magnitude, from the interior of India, enabled us to make many ob&s;ervations, The trunk is of the &s;ame form as that of the <HI>Fulgora Candelaria.</HI> The colour is a dark but beautiful purple: the apex &s;carlet, of a perfectly pellucid appearance, and &s;till retains a reddi&s;h glare. The &s;pots of while, &s;prinkled on the purple colour of the trunk, exhibit al&s;o a &s;light appear|ance of pho&s;phoric matter. On the trunk of the Fulgora Candelaria the&s;e white &s;pots are very con&s;pi|cuous.</P>
<P>Though the generic name Fulgora &s;eems to imply &s;ome effulgent property in the in&s;ects that compo&s;e the genus, it is uncertain whether all po&s;&s;e&s;s that property. They are indeed furni&s;hed with a trunk, but it is &s;maller in proportion, in &s;everal &s;pecies, than in F. Lanternaria, Candelaria, Flammea, Pho&s;pho|rea,
<PB REF="50">and &s;ome others. It has not been determined whether any of the European Fulgorae &s;hine in the night time. The genus is very limited, including the di&s;coveries of modern naturali&s;ts. Fabricius de|&s;cribes only twenty-five &s;pecies; of the&s;e, &s;even are European, and eighteen extra-European. Two &s;pecies are found in England.</P>
<P>Chry&s;anthemum Indicum.&mdash;Indian Chry&s;anthemum.</P>
<P>This is a very lately introduced &s;pecies in England. It is mentioned by Sir G. Staunton among the plants collected in the provinces of <HI>Shan-tung</HI> and <HI>Kiang-nan.</HI> Thunberg de&s;cribes it as a native of Japan in the <HI>Flora Japonica.</HI> A variety of it is figured in the <HI>Hortus Malabaricus;</HI> and in the <HI>Herbarium Amboinen&s;e</HI> is another. We ob&s;erve a great di&s;&s;imilarity between the figures of this plant in different works. That figured in the <HI>Herb. Amb.</HI> has very &s;mall flowers, &s;carcely broader than our large dai&s;y<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chry&s;anthemum Leucanthemum.</NOTE>: the leaves in clu&s;|ters, &s;ome very large, and others &s;mall. In the <HI>Hort. Malab.</HI> the flowers are twice the &s;ize of the former, and the leaves are placed much a&s;under. The flowers of our &s;pecimen are con&s;iderably larger than either of the&s;e; yet not of the magnitude repre&s;ented in the plate of Mr. Curtiss Botanical Magazine.</P>
<P>This Chry&s;anthemum is not peculiar to China, though it has been long cultivated in that country. It grows &s;pontaneou&s;ly in &s;ome parts of Japan; and from the name it bears in the Arabic, Per&s;ic, and other languages, is probably known in mo&s;t parts of A&s;ia.</P>

<P>Though the ob&s;ervations that Sir G. Staunton has made on the natural production of China, in his late publication, were nece&s;&s;arily very general, the &s;cience of in&s;ects appears to have engaged his particular attention; and on that account we mu&s;t lament, that untoward events, precluded him from ob&s;erving more minutely, the peculiarities of &s;ome kinds, and the economical purpo&s;es of others.</P>
<P>In the general hi&s;tories of unknown countries, (and we can &s;carcely con&s;ider China in any other view) the entomologi&s;t mu&s;f expect to find his favourite &s;cience neglected, or treated in a manner more likely to excite curio&s;ity than reward enquiry. The work of this learned writer is an exception to our remark; though a few inaccuracies occur in it. We peru&s;e the following account of an unknown &s;pecies of Cicada with particular regret, becau&s;e, it withholds information intere&s;ting to the naturali&s;t, and, from its air of novelty, is likely to promote an erroneous opinion concerning that &s;ingular tribe of in&s;ects.</P>
<P>"The low and &s;ometimes mar&s;hy country, through which the river<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Pei-ho.</NOTE> pa&s;&s;es, is favourable to the pro|duction of in&s;ects; and many of them were trouble&s;ome, &s;ome principally by their &s;ting; and others by their con&s;tant &s;tunning noi&s;e. The mu&s;ic emitted by <HI>a &s;pecies of Cicada</HI> was not of the vocal kind; but produced by the motion of two flaps or lamellae which cover the abdomen or belly of the in&s;ect. It is the &s;ignal of invitation from the male of <HI>that &s;pecies</HI> to allure the female, which latter is quite unprovided with the&s;e organs of court&s;hip<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chap. 3. Vol. II. octavo.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Again, when de&s;eribing a town higher up the river, that author &s;ays, "The &s;hops of Hai-tien, in addi|tion to nece&s;&s;aries, abounded in toys and trifles, calculated to amu&s;e the rich and idle of both &s;exes, even to cages containing in&s;ects, &s;uch as the <HI>noi&s;y Cicada,</HI> and a large &s;pecies of the Gryllus<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Chap. 4. Vol. II.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The reader may imagine from the fir&s;t account, that the mu&s;ic of every other &s;pecies of Cicada is of the vocal kind, or that it is peculiar to this Chine&s;e in&s;ect to be furni&s;hed with lamellae that cau&s;e a &s;ound. The latter account confirms &s;uch conjecture, by alluding in a &s;pecific manner to the <HI>noi&s;y Cicada,</HI> as to an in&s;ect de&s;cribed in a former part of the work. We mu&s;t remark, that not only the males of the &s;pecies mentioned by that author, are furni&s;hed with tho&s;e lamellae, but the whole of that &s;ection of the Linnaean Cicadae which Fabricius has called Tettiogonia<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">This includes all the larger &s;pecies of Linnaean Cicadae, &s;uch as <HI>C. Orni, Tibicien, reticulata, haematodes, &s;tridula,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. for in &s;ome editions of the Sy&s;tema Naturae of Linnaeus we find <HI>Cicada Noctilucae,</HI> which in later editions are the <HI>Fulgorae,</HI> and al&s;o the <HI>C. cruciatae, mannifera, &s;pumantes</HI> and <HI>deflexae</HI> included in one genus.</NOTE>. The males of the &s;pecies included in the other &s;ections of that genus are certainly furni&s;hed with them al&s;o; though &s;ome of them are too minute to be ob&s;erved without a gla&s;s. The&s;e lamellae vary in &s;ize in different &s;pecies; but the accounts we have of them from travellers in foreign countries, and naturali&s;ts both ancient and modern, prove they all emit a certain &s;ound to allure the female. As we are unable to a&s;certain the Chine&s;e &s;pecies Sir George mentions, neither figure or de&s;cription accompanying his account of it, we mu&s;t therefore, &s;peak generally of the whole genus, and then confine our remarks to tho&s;e &s;pecies we are acquainted with from China. Among the&s;e are C. <HI>&s;pendidula, &s;anguinea,</HI> and <HI>atrata.</HI> The latter, we believe, is the large&s;t &s;pecies of the Chine&s;e Ci|cadae known in Europe.</P>
<P>Some &s;pecies of this tribe were known to the ancients. With them it was the emblem of happine&s;s and eternal youth<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Probably becau&s;e it was &s;uppo&s;ed to live only a &s;hort time. The renewal of youth is illu&s;trated by the &s;tory of the Tithonus transformed by Aurora into a Cicada.</NOTE>; and if we examine the legends of pagan mythology, we find they were deemed a race of creatures beloved by gods<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><L><HI>Phaebus</HI> is thy &s;ire divine;</L>

</TEXT></Q></NOTE><HI>&amp; l'arbre qui porte le &s;uif.</HI> His relations are, perhaps, too prolix, but they are evidently the re&s;ult of attentive ob&s;ervation, and &s;erve to illu&s;trate the Natural Hi&s;tory, and economical purpo&s;es, of the &s;ubjects we are noticing: they are briefly the&s;e. The white wax of China is called <HI>Tchang pe la;</HI> it is not the &s;ame as the white wax of bees, but is the produce of a &s;ort of in&s;ect that feeds on a tree called <HI>Tong t&ccedil;in:</HI> the&s;e in&s;ects form a kind of white grea&s;e which attaches to the branches of the tree, hardens, and becomes wax. It is &s;craped from the branches of the trees in autumn, melted on the fire, &s;trained; then poured into cold water, where it coagulates and forms it&s;elf into cakes. This wax is very white and glo&s;&s;y; it is mixed with oil and made into candles, and is much &s;uperior to the wax of bees for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB REF="61"><HI>Chi tchin,</HI> a Chine&s;e writer, &s;ays, it was not till the dyna&s;ty of <HI>Yuen</HI> that the wax made by the&s;e in&s;ects began to be known; the cu&s;tom then became very general to employ it both in medicine and making candles. Its medicinal virtues are highly extolled by the Chine&s;e phy&s;icians, and particularly by <HI>Tchi hen.</HI> It is &s;aid to be a drug ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;urgeons, that it makes the fle&s;h clo&s;e, &s;tops bleeding, appea&s;es pain, unites the nerves, rejoints the bones, and taken in pills, kills the worms that occa&s;ion con&s;umptions. It is found in mo&s;t of the &s;outh-ea&s;t provinces of China; but the be&s;t is brought from <HI>Sc tchuen</HI> and <HI>Yunnan,</HI> and from the territories of <HI>Hen tcheou,</HI> and <HI>Yung tcheou.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;ects are white when young, and it is then they make their wax. When old, they are of a blacki&s;h che&s;nut colour, and form little pelotons on the branches of trees. The&s;e pelotons, at fir&s;t, are about the &s;ize of a grain of millet; towards the beginning of the &s;pring they increa&s;e in bulk and &s;pread; they are attached to the branches like grapes, and at fir&s;t &s;ight, the trees that bear them, appear loaded with fruit. About the beginning of May, they gather them, and having enveloped them in the leaves of <HI>Yo</HI> (a &s;pecies of broad-leaved gra&s;s), they are &s;u&s;pended to the trees. At the end of June, and in July, the pelotons open, and the in&s;ects come forth, crawl about the leaves, and form their wax.</P>
<P>Sir G. Staunton, in his learned work, has al&s;o de&s;cribed the Wax in&s;ect; he found it at Turon Bay, in Cochin China, and has cau&s;ed it to be repre&s;ented in a vignette plate, with the following de&s;cription. "Among other objects of natural curio&s;ity, accident led to the ob&s;ervation of &s;ome &s;warms of uncommon
<PB REF="62">in&s;ects bu&s;ily employed upon &s;mall branches of a &s;hrub, then neither in fruit or flower, but in its general habit bearing &s;omewhat the appearance of a privet. The&s;e in&s;ects, each not much exceeding the &s;ize of the dome&s;tic fly, were of a curious &s;tructure, having pectinated appendages ri&s;ing in a curve, bending to|wards the head, not unlike the form of the tail feathers of the common fowl, but in the oppo&s;ite direction. Every part of the in&s;ect was, in colour, of a perfect white, or at lea&s;t completely covered with a white powder. The particular &s;tem frequented by tho&s;e in&s;ects, was entirely whitened by a &s;ub&s;tance or powder of that colour, &s;trewed upon it by them. The &s;ub&s;tance or powder was &s;uppo&s;ed to form the white wax of the Ea&s;t. This &s;ub&s;tance is a&s;&s;erted, on the &s;pot, to have the property, by a particular manipulation, of giving in certain proportions, with vegetable oil, &s;uch &s;olidity to the compo&s;ition as to render the whole equally capable of being moulded into candles. The fact is a&s;certained, indeed, in &s;ome degree, by the &s;imple experiment of di&s;&s;olving one part of this wax in three parts of olive oil made hot. The whole, when cold, will coagulate into a ma&s;s, approaching to the firmne&s;s of bees wax."</P>
<P>From the accurate de&s;cription and figures of the latter author, it is evident, the creature that produces the white wax of China, is an imperfect in&s;ect, or, technically &s;peaking, the pupa of an in&s;ect, which, in its mature &s;tate, is furni&s;hed with wings. This is clearly the fact, for the rudiments of wings are vi&s;ible in the figures alluded to<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">This may account for a pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Gordon</HI>'s de&s;cription of China, where he &s;ays, "In the plains" of Houquang "are va&s;t numbers of little <HI>worms</HI> that produce wax, in the &s;ame manner as bees do honey," if we under&s;tand by <HI>worms,</HI> in&s;ects not arrived at maturity; for the larva of Bombyx Mori, is al&s;o termed a &s;ilk worm, though it belongs to the moth tribe when perfect.</NOTE>. The metamorpho&s;e of in&s;ects are &s;o various, and their appearance &s;o changed in pa&s;&s;ing from one &s;tate to another, that the identity of any &s;pecies in the larva or pupa can only be proved by actual ob&s;ervation; neither do the larva or pupa po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e characteri&s;tic differences by which naturali&s;ts determine one &s;pecies from another; and this con&s;ideration deters us from deciding on the preci&s;e &s;pecies, to which the pupa before us &s;hould be referred.</P>
<P>STOHL, a Dutch author, has been more fortunate; he has a&s;certained this identical creature to be the pupa of Cicada Limbata, and in his work on <HI>Cimices</HI> and <HI>Cicades,</HI> gives a figure of it under the title of <HI>De Waldraag&s;ter</HI> (Nymphe) or <HI>La Cigale Porte Laine,</HI> fig. 144, together with the winged in&s;ect at fig. 145; and it is on this authority Cicada Limbata is introduced in the annexed plate.</P>
<P>We are &s;trongly inclined to credit the accuracy of Stohl in this in&s;tance; there is much &s;imilarity be|tween the pupa and the cicada, and &s;ome &s;triking characteri&s;tics are common to both. They agree in the &s;tructure of the antennae, and probo&s;cis, or &s;ucking trunk; the abdomen of the winged in&s;ect is al&s;o loaded with a fine white powder, and is furni&s;hed at the extremity with a tuft of down and hairs, &s;imilar to that &s;o eminently con&s;picuous in the pupa &s;tate. We have, however, ob&s;erved the white powder, and tuft on the abdomen of Cicada lanata, and have rea&s;on to imagine it al&s;o forms a white wax, &s;imilar to that of the pre&s;ent &s;pecies.</P>
<P><PB REF="63">The Cicada limbata is of a light green colour, with a red margin; that which Stohl has figured is of a pale brown, with a black margin. The&s;e are the <HI>&s;pecies</HI> and <HI>variety</HI> Fabricius de&s;cribes, for the &s;pecimens he refers to, in the collection of Sir Jo&s;eph Banks, agree preci&s;ely with our in&s;ects. Fabricius notes the <HI>habitat</HI> Africa. Stohl received the green &s;pecimen from the I&s;land of Ceylon; the pale &s;ort from Africa. The larva we have repre&s;ented is from China; and the Cicada was brought from the Ea&s;t Indies, by the late Mr. Ellis.</P>
<P><HI>Croton Sebiferum&mdash;Poplar-leaved Croton, or Tallow-tree.</HI></P>
<P>The Tallow-tree is not the natural food of the Wax in&s;ect, but as they mutually illu&s;trate the &s;ame in|quiry, they are repre&s;ented in the &s;ame plate; and it is further pre&s;umed, that a &s;hort account of this u&s;e|ful plant, will be deemed a proper &s;equel to the hi&s;tory of the in&s;ect.</P>
<P>Du Halde, when de&s;cribing the Tallow-tree, &s;ays, "Il e&s;t de la hauteur d'une grande cerifier. Le fruit e&s;t renferm&eacute;e dans un &eacute;corce qu'on appelle <HI>Yen Kiou,</HI> et qui s'ouvre par le milieu quand il e&s;t m&ucirc;r, comme celle de la ch&acirc;taigne. Il con&s;i&s;te en des grains blancs de la gro&s;&s;eur d'un noi&s;ette, dont la chair a les qualitez du &s;uif; au&s;&s;i en fait-on des chandelles, apr&egrave;s l'avoir fait fondre, en y m&ecirc;lant &s;ouvent un pen d'huile ordinaire, et trempant les chandelles dans la cire qui vient fur l'arbre dont je vais parler: il s'en forme autour du &s;uif une e&s;p&eacute;ce de cro&ucirc;te qui l'emp&ecirc;che de couler<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">"It is of the height of a large cherry-tree; the fruit is inclo&s;ed in a &s;hell, called <HI>Yen Kiou,</HI> which, when ripe, opens in the middle like the che&s;nut. The fruit con&s;i&s;ts of white kernels of the &s;ize of a &s;mall, or hazel nut, who&s;e &s;ub&s;tance has all the qualities of tallow; &s;o that they make candles of it, after having melted and mixed it with a &s;mall portion of common oil, and then dipping the candles into the wax before mentioned, it forms a kind of cru&s;t round the tallow that prevents its run|ning, or wa&s;ting.</NOTE>. Page 18. Vol. I.</P>
<P>Sir G. Staunton &s;peaks nearly to the &s;ame effect: "From the fruit of the <HI>Croton &s;ebiferum,</HI> of Lin|naeus, the Chine&s;e obtain a kind of vegetable fat, with which they make a great proportion of their candles. This fruit, in its external appearance, bears &s;ome re&s;emblance to the berries of the ivy. As &s;oon as it is ripe, the cap&s;ule opens and divides into two, or, more frequently, three divi&s;ions, and falling off, di&s;covers as many kernels, each attached by a &s;eparate foot-&s;talk, and covered with a fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance of a &s;nowy whitene&s;s, contra&s;ting beautifully with the leaves of the tree, which, at this &s;ea&s;on, are of a tint between a purple and a &s;carlet. The fat, or fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance, is &s;eparated from the kernels by cru&s;hing and boiling them in water. The candles made of this fat are firmer than tho&s;e of tallow, as well as free
<PB REF="64">from all offen&s;ive odour. They are not, however, equal to tho&s;e of wax or &s;permaceti." This author further adds, "The wax for candles, is generally the produce of in&s;ects, feeding chiefly on the privet, as is mentioned in the chapter of Cochin China. It is naturally white, and &s;o pure as to produce no &s;moke; but is collected in &s;uch &s;mall quantities, as to be &s;carce and dear. Cheap candles are al&s;o made of tal|low, and even of grea&s;e of too little con&s;i&s;tence to be u&s;ed, without the contrivance of being coated with the firmer &s;ub&s;tance of the tallow-tree or of wax." <HI>Vide Chapter on Sou-choo foo.</HI></P>
<P>The tallow-tree is now cultivated in the We&s;t Indies, where it thrives well, and produces fruit, and by proper attention may hereafter become u&s;eful.</P>

It is true, authors agree that the &s;ounds of &s;ome kinds are exceeding loud and harmonious, and in the early ages of the world the&s;e might have a powerful influence on the human mind.

Reaumur ob&s;erves, that although the <HI>lamellae</HI> have a kind of moveable hinge, they have al&s;o a &s;tiff and pointed tooth, or &s;pine, that prevents them from being li&s;ted far back; and, if &s;trained, are very liable to be broken.</P>
<P>From the anatomical de&s;cription of Roe&s;el, we find that, within the two hollows that are &s;een when the lamellae are li&s;ted up, two very &s;mooth &s;kins are vi&s;ible; the&s;e are highly poli&s;hed, of nearly a &s;emicircular &s;hape, and re&s;lect pri&s;matic colours: there is between tho&s;e a hard brown projection, or corner which unites with another piece above them in a longitudinal direction, to the under part of the brea&s;t. This longitudinal piece divides a triangular red &s;pace or field into two parts, one on the right &s;ide, and the other on the left. Above the&s;e, in a tran&s;ver&s;e direction, is &s;een two &s;mall yellow &s;kins; the lamellae in their natural po&s;ition conceal the&s;e organs becau&s;e they fold exactly over them.</P>
<P>Reaumur, in the exterior appearance of the&s;e parts, could di&s;cover nothing that could lead to determine the organs of the &s;ound; and he was not &s;atisfied that the &s;light motion of the lamellae on the&s;e parts could produce the loud &s;inging noi&s;e of the Cicada. He opened a few cicadae on the back part of the body, &s;o that the inner &s;tructure of the under &s;ide was di&s;played, and e&s;pecially the parts connected to the curious organs he had di&s;covered under the lamellae. At la&s;t he di&s;covered two large mu&s;cles, which at their point of union formed a &s;pace almo&s;t &s;quare, and were connected with the red triangular fields he had ob&s;erved on the under &s;ide: as he concluded the&s;e formed a material part of the organs he wi&s;hed to di&s;cover, he examined them attentively, and found that, by moving them backwards and forwards, he could make a cicada &s;ing that had been dead many months. Although the &s;ound was not &s;trong, it tended to prove that he had di&s;covered the in&s;trument that produced it.&mdash;In another part he &s;ays it is evident the &s;ound is cau&s;ed by the little &s;kins connected to the mu&s;cles, becau&s;e when they were rubbed: with a bit of paper they emitted that kind of &s;ound.</P>
<P>Roe&s;el has di&s;covered two little pieces of horny &s;ub&s;tance that arc connected by a &s;ort of fibre within the &s;kins, in the body, and he &s;uppo&s;es when this is in motion, it &s;trikes again&s;t the before-mentioned thin &s;kins, and produces a &s;ound, by the &s;ame means as a hollow body, or drum, when &s;truck with a &s;tick: and al&s;o that this noi&s;e may be varied or modulated by a &s;light motion of the lamellae, but cannot be produced without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the internal nerves and mu&s;cles connected with the organs fir&s;t de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Authors agree that the Cicadae of hot countries emit the loude&s;t &s;ound. It appears from the papers of Mr. Smeethman (who re&s;ided it con&s;iderable time in Africa) publi&s;hed by Mr. Drury, that the &s;ound of &s;ome kinds peculiar to that part of the world is &s;o loud as to be heard at half a mile di&s;tance; and that the &s;inging of one within doors, &s;ilences a whole company.&mdash; The &s;ame attentive ob&s;erver &s;ays, the open parts of the country are never without their mu&s;ic, &s;ome &s;inging in the evening and others only in the day.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;itions of the&s;e authors &s;eem well founded; we have examined many &s;pecies that were un|known to them, and find the &s;pine before mentioned, &s;o placed in many in&s;ects, as to prevent the motion
<PB REF="67">of the lamellae. We have a &s;pecimen from America, which, in addition to the u&s;ual organs of &s;ound, have two large hollow protuberances or drums; one on each &s;ide of the abdomen; and mu&s;t, we imagine, produce a louder &s;ound than any yet di&s;covered: a &s;pecies very &s;imilar to this is al&s;o brought from New Holland.</P>
<P>The probo&s;cis of tho&s;e in&s;ects is a hard or horny tube, in which a very acute; &s;lender &s;ucking-pipe is con|cealed. The horny tube is not unlike a gimlet in form, and is u&s;ed by tho&s;e creatures to bore through the bark of trees, to extract the juices, on which it feeds. Linnaeus has named the &s;pecies of one divi&s;ion in his Sy&s;tem, <HI>Mannifera,</HI> becau&s;e they had been ob&s;erved to fly among a&s;h trees, bore many holes in them, and when the manna had oozed out, return and carry it off.</P>
<P>With this probo&s;cis they bore holes in the &s;mall twigs of the extreme branches of trees, and depo&s;it their eggs in them, &s;ometimes to the amount of &s;ix or &s;even hundred. As each cell contains no more than from twelve to twenty eggs, it does great damage to the trees they frequent. Stohl &s;ays, "the common one<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Lu Cigale Vicilleu&s;e. Cicad. Tibicien.</NOTE>, which is &s;ound at Surinam in the coffee plantations, greatly injures tho&s;e trees; the females depo&s;it|ing their eggs in the young &s;hoots, and in holes they bore with their &s;heath. They live on the juices of the trees."</P>
<P><PB REF="68">M. Merian gives a figure and account of the metamorpho&s;e of a cicada found in Surinam. She has mi&s;taken the winged in&s;ect to be only the pupa of the <HI>Fulgora Lanternaria,</HI> which is too ab&s;urd to de&s;erve contradiction; in other re&s;pects her account is intere&s;ting, and particularly that part which relates to the pupa &s;tate, or chafer, as it is termed. "The pomegranate tree," &s;ays Merian, "&s;o well known in all other countries, grows al&s;o in the fields of Surinam. On them I have found a &s;pecies of chafer, which is naturally very lazy, and con&s;equently very ea&s;y to be caught. It carries underneath the head a long trunk, with which it ea&s;ily penetrates the flowers, in order to extract the honey from them. On the 20th of May, when they were laying quite quiet, the &s;kin of the back bur&s;t open, and green flies, with tran&s;parent wings, i&s;&s;ued from them. The&s;e flies are found in abundance in Surinam, and have &s;uch a rapid flight, that it took me many hours to catch one."</P>
<P>The pupa we received from China with our Cicada atrata, very much re&s;embles that figured by Merian. It has the long &s;ucking trunk or probo&s;cis; but the mo&s;t formidable of its weapons &s;eem to be the fore feet, which are thick, &s;trong, and armed with &s;pines or teeth; with the&s;e it may do more injury to the plants, by tearing off the tender &s;hoots, than by wounding the trunk to extract the moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>We have repre&s;ented the upper and under &s;ide of a male of this intere&s;ting &s;pecies, Cicada atrata, not only to illu&s;trate our preceding remarks, but becau&s;e we believe no figure has been given of it by any author, unle&s;s <HI>De Zwarte Chinee&s;che cicade</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">La Cigale Chinoi&s;e noire, pres de Canton en Chine.

<P>The general appearance of both &s;exes of Cicada atrata is very &s;imilar, except that the female is fur|ni&s;hed with a &s;heath, and the male with lamellae. The &s;heath of the female is partly concealed within a valve at the extremity of the abdomen, and is only protruded when the creature lays her eggs. In the figure of the under &s;urface of a male in&s;ect, exhibited in the annexed plate, the lamellae are di&s;tingui&s;hed by two &s;tars: the &s;ingle &s;tar denotes the &s;ituation of the &s;pine, mentioned by Roe&s;el and Reaumur.</P>
<P><HI>Laurus Camphora.&mdash;Camphor-tree.</HI></P>
<P>The tree which produces the u&s;eful drug <HI>camphor</HI> is very abundant in Japan and China. Sir G. Staunton &s;ays it is the only &s;pecies of the laurel genus growing in China, where it is a large and valuable timber, and is never cut up for the &s;ake of the drug; but that &s;ub&s;tance is obtained by decocting the &s;mall branches, twigs, and leaves, and &s;ubliming the camphor in luted earthen ve&s;&s;els. A purer &s;ort is brought from the i&s;land of Borneo and Japan, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a natural exudation from the tree when the bark is wounded. Sir G. Staunton &s;ays the Camphor-tree is felled in tho&s;e countries for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of finding the drug in &s;ub&s;tance among the &s;plinters.</P>

<P>M. Merian has given a plate and de&s;cription of this &s;pecies in her work on the In&s;ects of Surinaim. We learn from that account, that in the larva and pupa &s;tate it lives in the water; that it is a voracious creature, and feeds not only on the weaker kinds of aquatic in&s;ects, but on &s;ome animals much larger than it&s;elf. The pupat<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are <HI>&s;emi-completa:</HI> unlike the pupa of the Lepidoptera, &amp;c. the&s;e &s;carcely di&s;&s;er in appearance or manners of life from the complete in&s;ect, but have only the rudiments of the wings.</NOTE> is repre&s;ented on the back of a large frog in the water, and is de&s;igned to pourtray the manner in which it fa&s;tens on tho&s;e creatures, holds them between its &s;trong curved fore feet<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">If the&s;e corre&s;pond with the antennae of other in&s;ects, the Nepa has only &s;our feet.</NOTE>, and extracts the juices of their bodies, through its &s;ingularly con&s;tructed beak.

<P>Every writer on this in&s;ect &s;ince M.

<P>In&s;ects in general di&s;cover an extraordinary degree of care, and ingenuity, in depo&s;iting their eggs in the mo&s;t &s;ecure &s;ituations, or places where the infant brood, when hatched, may be provided with proper &s;u&s;tenance. Tho&s;e of the aquatic kind u&s;ually lay them in rece&s;&s;es in the mud or &s;and, or under loo&s;e &s;tones that lie at the bottom of the water: others, with as much care, and more ingenuity, hollow out the interior &s;ub&s;tance of the large &s;talks of water plants, and depo&s;it their eggs in them; or, ri&s;ing out of the water, lay them in the extreme branches of tho&s;e plants, to &s;ecure them from other aquatic depredators. The Nepa ru&s;tica di&s;plays even more &s;agacity, or attachment for its eggs, than tho&s;e creatures; for it never leaves them. Till they are hatched, it bears them on its back, in a clu&s;ter of an oval &s;hape; the&s;e eggs are of an oblong form, and are fa&s;tened by the narrowe&s;t end to a thin film, or plate of cement, that cau&s;es them to adhere to the poli&s;hed &s;urface of the wing ca&s;es; when the&s;e eggs, about an hundred in number, are hatched, it ca&s;ts off the exuviae of the clu&s;ter, and differs no longer in general appearance from the male of the &s;ame &s;pecies.</P>

<P>The &s;imile propo&s;ed by Linnaeus for the arrangement of Butterflies, is gleaned from ancient and fabulous hi&s;tory. The &s;pecies are divided into &s;ections of Trojan and Greek princes, heroes, deities, nymphs, and plebeians: this allegorical &s;y&s;tem, which is well conducted, &s;eems liable to le&s;s objection, than the cha|racters a&s;&s;igned to each &s;ection: for many &s;pecies placed among the Equites, and a more con&s;iderable num|ber with the Plebeii, are incon&s;i&s;tent with the e&s;&s;ential criterion Linnaeus has given. This arrangement has undergone &s;ome material alterations in the <HI>Entomologia Sy&s;tematica</HI> of Fabricius; alterations, perhaps ju&s;tified, by the comprehen&s;ive view, its author has taken of this plea&s;ing branch of Entomology. The Equites, with many additions, and a few exceptions, are the &s;ame as tho&s;e in the two Linnaean &s;ections: Papilio Priamus, is however, removed from the head of the <HI>Equites Trojani,</HI> and the precedence given to Papilio Paris.</P>
<P>Papilio Paris is an in&s;ect of con&s;iderable beauty. The general colour on the upper &s;urface ob&s;cure brown, nearly approaching black, but finely contra&s;ted with brilliant green atoms, that are profu&s;ely &s;prinkled over it. The po&s;terior wings are adorned with a large blue &s;pot, which derives additional lu&s;tre from the du&s;ky colour &s;urrounding it. Another &s;pecies, very &s;imilar to Papilio Paris, but without this &s;pot, is al&s;o found in China. It is the &s;uppo&s;ed female of our &s;pecies.

<P>The &s;ingular delicacy and beauty of this Papilio is not the only claim it has to the particular attention of Entomologi&s;ts: it is clearly an unde&s;cribed &s;pecies; and perhaps the only &s;pecimen of it yet brought to Europe, is that from which our figure is copied.

<P>Mo&s;t naturali&s;ts are undetermined whether Papilio Menelaus and the &s;uppo&s;ed variety, Papilio Rhetenor, &s;hould not be con&s;idered di&s;tinct &s;pecies. The colour of the upper &s;ide is nearly the &s;ame in both in&s;ects; but the under &s;ides are very different. The Linnaean de&s;cription of the male, P. Menelaus, agrees with Papilio Rhetenor, and probably he con&s;idered them the two &s;exes of one in&s;ect. Fabricius would certainly have made a new &s;pecies of it, if he had not been of the &s;ame opinion. We have both in&s;ects before us, and &s;hould mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly make a new &s;pecies of P. Rhetenor, as Cramer and Sulzer have done, if the authority of the la&s;t work of Fabricius were not oppo&s;ed to us.</P>
<P>Papilio Menelaus is a native of South America. Sulzer's &s;pecimen of Papilio Rhetenor came from China. Foreign Entomologi&s;ts, for this and other rea&s;ons, have con&s;idered them di&s;tinct &s;pecies. The curious in in&s;ects, &s;ays Cramer, call this butterfly <HI>Le Satir&eacute; bleu oblong,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from P. Menclaus, or <HI>Le Satin&eacute; bleu vulgaire.</HI>&mdash;Cramer has al&s;o given a third and much &s;maller kind of the&s;e blue butterflies, <HI>Pap. Adonis,</HI> which Fabricius al&s;o con&s;iders a variety of Menclaus.</P>
<P>Whatever effect the arti&s;t can produce by a combination of the mo&s;t brilliant colours employed in painting, he mu&s;t &s;hrink from compari&s;on of it with this &s;plendid creature. It is impo&s;&s;ible to find in any part of the animal creation colours more beautiful or changeable. Pale blue is the principal colour, but new tints meet the eye in every direction, varying from a &s;ilvery green to the deepe&s;t purple; and the whole &s;urface glittering with the re&s;plendence of highly poli&s;hed metal.</P>

<P>Sir G. Staunton &s;ays the bohea tea is &s;upplied in China from the province of Fochen: the green tea from Kiang-nan.

<P>The number of Chine&s;e &s;pecies of this genus, already de&s;cribed, is very limited: our pre&s;ent in&s;ect is the large&s;t of them; but, as this is inferior in &s;ize to &s;everal kinds found in Europe, we conceive there mu&s;t remain many larger &s;pecies of the genus unknown to collectors of foreign in&s;ects, and yet very com|mon in China. In the latter part of Sir G. Staunton's work, that author mentions the larva of a <HI>Sphinx Moth</HI> which furni&s;h an article for the table of the Chine&s;e. We regret that the indefinite expre&s;&s;ion can|not not a&s;&s;i&s;t us to determine the &s;pecies, and &s;carcely the genus, of the in&s;ect alluded to<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">European naturali&s;ts are entirely ignorant of the Chine&s;e in&s;ects in the &s;tate of larva and pupa, if we except a &s;ew &s;pecies of the Cimices, Cicada, and &s;ome altogether unintere&s;ting in&s;ects, that have been accidentally brought among others from that country. Hence it mu&s;t remain undetermined whether they corre&s;pond in form with tho&s;e of other parts of the world. It is, however, highly probable, from their great affinity to tho&s;e, in the perfect &s;tate, that in the &s;tate of larva they may al&s;o agree. The exten&s;ive collection of the larva of &s;phinges made by Mr. Abbot in North America affords no &s;ingularly con&s;tructed animal di&s;tinct from tho&s;e &s;ound in Europe; they vary indeed in their colours, but pre&s;erve uniformly the characters found on the &s;ame genus in other countries. We noticed among the drawings of the late Mr. Brad&s;haw the figure of a Chine&s;e &s;phinx, apparently <HI>S. Hylas,</HI> together with a larva &s;imilar to that of the Sphinx Stellatarum: it was green, and, like all the known larva of the genus, (except the <HI>Ad&s;citae</HI> divi&s;ion) was perfectly free from hairs: it was al&s;o furni&s;hed with a horn at the po&s;terior part of the body.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>It is altogether perplexing, and my&s;terious to us, that Fabricius, throughout all his works, and even in his la&s;t enlarged and corrected &s;y&s;tematic arrangement, has given a Papilio Thallo in the <HI>Heliconii</HI> divi&s;ion of that genus, when it is clear no &s;uch Papilio has exi&s;tence. Linnaeus has, undoubtedly, &s;o named an in|&s;ect figured in a plate of Edwards's birds, tab. 226, with a reference to that work; yet it is certain the in&s;ect there figured is not a butterfly, but a lepidopterous In&s;ect, to which antennae of dubious &s;tructure have been added, to perfect its appearance<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Coincident ob&s;ervations on perfect &s;pecimens of &s;everal in&s;ects, nearly allied to this &s;pecies, tend to convince us, that the arti&s;t had only a mutilated &s;pecimen to copy from. Indeed, though the antennae in his figure are terminated in a kind of capi|tulum, like that of the butterflies, the filaments are &s;omewhat jagged, as if intended to appear &s;lightly pectinated. Cramer notices the very clo&s;e affinity between his in&s;ect, <HI>P. Tiberina,</HI> and that in Edwards's work; which, he ob&s;erves, differs neither in form nor colour, but only in having clubbed antennae: tho&s;e parts of his in&s;ect being pectinated or feathered.&mdash;"Mr. Edwards a repr&eacute;&s;ent&eacute; un Papillon, qui ne differe de celui-ci, ni pour la coleur, ni pour la de&s;&s;ein, mais qui a des antennes &agrave; boutons. Celui que nous donnons ici e&s;t grav&eacute; d'apres une Phal&ecirc;ne qui a des antennes plumac&eacute;es," &amp;c. <HI>Cram.</HI> C. D. Pl. 32.
<P>Edwards calls this in&s;ect the little black and white Butcher fly, becau&s;e it is figured on a plate with the black and white Butcher bird.</P></NOTE>. No later author has figured the &s;ame &s;pecies; and &s;pecimens of it being extremely &s;carce, it is probable Fabricius has been unable to detect the error. In admitting this, however, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily notice the &s;ynonyms of <HI>Sphinx pectinicornis,</HI> where he al&s;o quotes the &s;ame figure in the works of Edwards. Thus we find, throughout all the editions of the Fabrician Sy&s;tem, a <HI>Papilio Thallo</HI> and <HI>Sphinx pectinicornis</HI> formed of the &s;olitary figure of one in&s;ect. Cramer has finally increa&s;ed the ambiguity of its genera, by making an in&s;ect of clo&s;e affinity, perhaps the &s;ame &s;pecies, a Phalaena. <HI>Vide P. Tiberina.</HI></P>

<P>The Phalaenae are a tribe of in&s;ects remarkable for the neatne&s;s and &s;implicity of their colours. Their elegancies con&s;i&s;t in the infinite variety, and delicacy of intermingled tints: the contra&s;t of &s;pots, &s;peck|lings, and lineations, which con&s;titute the minutiae of in&s;ect beauty. Some &s;pecies are to be excepted in this remark; the larger kinds are often gaudy, and the &s;malle&s;t exhibit a di&s;play of the riche&s;t colours, fancifully di&s;po&s;ed, and mo&s;t elegantly diver&s;ified.</P>
<P>The European &s;pecies are numerous, and pretty well a&s;certained: tho&s;e of remote countries remain in great ob&s;curity. The &s;pecies inhabiting China are almo&s;t unknown<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fab. Ent. Sy&s;t.</HI> The&s;e are chiefly de&s;cribed from in&s;ects in the collection of <HI>Mon&s;on Londini,</HI> of which no figures are extant, and the collection unknown.</NOTE>; for the late&s;t &s;y&s;tematic writer de&s;cribes not more than twenty &s;pecies in all the cabinets in Europe. From this &s;canty number a few are &s;elected to illu&s;trate the genus, and if the&s;e appear deficient in point of intere&s;t or variety, it may &s;timu|late others to collect new &s;pecies, whenever an opportunity occurs. The Phalaena tribe, not only of China, but every country, except of Europe, are a <HI>de&s;ideratum</HI> of entomology. In Europe the number of this tribe exceeds that of any other: on the contrary, the extra European &s;pecies are comparatively the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable of our acqui&s;itions. The Papiliones, or Butterflies, are a &s;howy and lively race: they &s;port in the open fields in day, and attract the traveller's curio&s;ity; hence our cabinets abound with them. But the moth, infinitely more numerous, and not le&s;s plea&s;ing, is &s;eldom &s;een; in the gloomine&s;s of its di&s;po|&s;itions,
<PB REF="125">it &s;eeks the ob&s;curity of the fore&s;t in the day, and only ventures on the wing when the &s;un is down. In Europe we vi&s;it its nocturnal haunts without difficulty or dread; but in hotter climates the&s;e are often|times impenetrable, or the lurking places of ferocious animals; and few will expo&s;e them&s;elves to their attacks, to increa&s;e the catalogue of exotic Phalaenae<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">The far greater number of Phalaenae can only be taken in the woods at night. This is termed <HI>mothing</HI> by collectors. The moths begin to &s;tir about twilight, and when almo&s;t dark, commence their flight. The collector is furni&s;hed with a large gauze folding-net, in which the in&s;ects are caught indi&s;criminately, for it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h one &s;pecies from another, and often is &s;o dark, that the object it&s;elf can barely be di&s;cerned. Different &s;pecies have their favourite haunts, &s;ome the lanes, and &s;kirts of woods, but many of them prefer the open breaks in the mo&s;t retired places. As it would be un&s;afe, or im|po&s;&s;ible, to penetrate the woods in many countries, it it better to collect the larva, or caterpillar, for the&s;e may be found on the trees in day-time, and if kept in little gauze cages, and carefully fed, will change into chry&s;alis, and produce the fly. This is certainly tedious, and few travellers will divert their attention from more important ob&s;ervations; but were they to appropriate their lei&s;ure to this branch of &s;cience, they would materially improve entomology. Mr. Abbot has inve&s;tigated a &s;mall di&s;trict of Georgia, in North America, in this manner, and our cabinet is indebted to his labours for &s;everal hundred &s;pecies, altogether new in Europe. The reader may e&s;timate the importance of the&s;e di&s;coveries, by referring to the two expen&s;ive volumes of North American In&s;ects, lately publi&s;hed; and reflecting, that the originals of all the &s;pecies included in that work, are but a &s;mall &s;election from tho&s;e he has furni&s;hed us with. Viewing the&s;e as the re&s;ult of one man's re&s;earch, in an incon&s;iderable portion of North America, what a variety of new and &s;plendid kinds would be the reward of tho&s;e, who &s;hould explore the more genial regions of A&s;ia, Africa, and South America, with equal diligence and information!
<P>We have hazarded an a&s;&s;ertion which may &s;eem inadmi&s;&s;ible, that the Phalaenae are infinitely more numerous than the Papiliones, or any other tribe of in&s;ects. Not that we po&s;&s;e&s;s more; but becau&s;e, in every country that has been inve&s;tigated, experience ju&s;tifies &s;uch opinion. For in&s;tance, in Great Britain, we have only &s;ixty Papiliones, and by mere accident two or three local &s;pecies have lately been added; of the Phalaenae we have more than 900. The &s;ame comparative proportion is ob&s;erved throughout the countries of the European continent; and it is &s;ingularly analogous, that our opinion is confirmed, by the recent di&s;coveries of Mr. Abbot in America al&s;o.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Phalaena Atlas is the fir&s;t &s;pecies we have to notice. It is the large&s;t of the moth tribe<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">When Linnaeus de&s;cribed it, few of the very large &s;pecies of Phalaena were known. We have two &s;pecies from the interior of Africa, that are larger than the Chine&s;e <HI>var.</HI> of Atlas, and &s;everal others &s;carcely inferior in magnitude.</NOTE>, and is, in|deed, gigantic creature. The &s;pecies is common, but not peculiar to China, being found in other parts of A&s;ia, and in America. The influence of climate is ea&s;ily traced in the <HI>varicties</HI> from different countries; that from Surinam is the large&s;t, and of the deepe&s;t colours. The Chine&s;e kind is the next in &s;ize; the colours incline to orange, and the anterior wings are more falcated or hooked at the ends. We have two other A&s;iatic <HI>varieties</HI> &s;till &s;maller, with the wings extremely falcated.</P>
<P>The larva of Phalaena Atlas is figured by <HI>M. Merian,</HI> in the <HI>In&s;ecta Surinamen&s;ia,</HI> plate 52: it is about four inches in length, green, with a yellow &s;tripe di&s;po&s;ed longitudinally. Upon each &s;egment are four di&s;tinct round tubercles of a coral-like orange colour, which are &s;urrounded with very delicate hairs. The pupa is large, and is inclo&s;ed in a web of an ochre colour. The &s;ilk of this web is of a &s;trong texture, and it has been imagined, if woven, would be &s;uperior in durability to that of the common &s;ilk worm. <HI>Seba</HI> has al&s;o repre&s;ented the larva at fig. 1. plate 57. vol. 4. <HI>The&s;aurus Naturae.</HI> It is nearly &s;ix inches in length, and bulky in proportion; the Phalaena is al&s;o larger than that figured by Merian, which is a
<PB REF="126">&s;mall &s;pecimen of the Surinam kind. According to Merian, there are three broods of this in&s;ect in a year; they are very common, and feed on the orange trees. Linnaeus &s;ays, they adhere &s;o tenaciou&s;ly to the leaves, that they can &s;carcely be taken off<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Larva verticillata verrucis pilo&s;is nec folliculos grandes, tenaces, vix extricandos. <HI>Linn. Sy&s;t. Nat.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The common &s;ilk worm, or Phalaena Mori, is of this family, and merits ob&s;ervation as a native of China. The art of weaving its threads into &s;ilk is of the earlie&s;t date. The di&s;covery is attributed to the <HI>Seres,</HI> a people of the Ea&s;t Indies, &s;uppo&s;ed the Chine&s;e<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Velleraque ut foliis depectant tenuia Seres. <HI>Virg. Georg.</HI> II. 122.</NOTE>. In the days of Solomon, we are told, a woman named Pamphilia, of the I&s;land of Co, was &s;killed in the art of making cloth, of the &s;ilk brought from the country of the Seres. The mo&s;t ancient of the Chine&s;e writers a&s;cribe the invention to one of the women of the emperor <HI>Hoang ti,</HI> named <HI>Si ling,</HI> and in honour <HI>Yuen fei</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">DU HALDE, <HI>Des Soycries.</HI> Les plus anciens &eacute;crivans de cet Empire, en attribuent la d&eacute;couverte &agrave; une des femmes de l'Empereur <HI>Hoang ti,</HI> nomm&eacute;e <HI>Si ling,</HI> et furnomm&eacute;e par honneur <HI>Yuen fei.</HI></NOTE>. When Rome degenerated into voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, Per&s;ia, its dependency, furni&s;hed this article of luxury; but it is &s;uppo&s;ed they were in|debted to the Chine&s;e for it, and being &s;upplied only in &s;mall quantities, it was con&s;equently dear. In Rome it was &s;o &s;carce, as to be worn only by per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e hi&s;torians affirm, that the di&s;covery was con&s;idered at fir&s;t of &s;uch importance, that all the women in the palace of the emperor were engaged in rearing the in&s;ect, and weaving its &s;ilk. In after times, the &s;ilk of China was a principal article of commerce, but latterly its value has been materially le&s;&s;ened, by the culture and fabrication of &s;ilk in other countries. As the Chine&s;e know little of the u&s;e of linen, the &s;ilk is a &s;taple article of their own con&s;umption. The je&s;uit mi&s;&s;ionaries mention &s;everal &s;orts of it, in u&s;e among the Chine&s;e; &s;ome admired for beauty, and others for durability. It is gene|rally &s;uppo&s;ed the&s;e are not merely the effect of different manufacture, but are the produce of di&s;|tinct in&s;ects<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">M. Merian &s;ays, in the de&s;cription of the Surinam variety of Phalaena Atlas: "Telam ducunt fortem, quare bonum fore &s;ericum rata, i&s;tius aliquam collegi copiam &amp; in Belgium tran&s;mi&s;i, ubi eadem optima judicata e&s;t: ut itaque, &s;i quis Erucas i&s;tas congregandi laborem non detrectaverit, et bonae notae bombycem, et maximum hinc lucrum &s;ibi comparare po&s;&s;et." The thread of which this coccon's web is compo&s;ed, is &s;o &s;trong, that it has been imagined it would make good &s;ilk. I have brought &s;ome of it into Holland, which has been e&s;teemed &s;uch. So that if any one would take the trouble to collect a number of the&s;e caterpillars, they would be found good &s;ilk worms, and produce great profit. MERIAN.&mdash;Abbot informs us, the Moths of the Emperor tribe, in general, are called Silk worms by the people of Georgia, and in the de&s;cription of Phalaena cecropia, is &s;till more explicit: for he &s;ays, "the caterpillar &s;pins on a twig. The out&s;ide web is coar&s;e, the inner covered with &s;ilk, like a &s;ilk worm's coccon. It is &s;aid this &s;ilk has been carded, &s;pun, and made into &s;tockings, and that it will wa&s;h like linen." <HI>Abbot's In&s;. by Dr. J. E. Smith.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e in&s;ects are all of the &s;ame natural order, P. Cecropia is rather &s;maller, but very &s;imilar to P. Atlas, and this information at lea&s;t corroborates the a&s;&s;ertion of Merian.
<P>An opinion, that the Chine&s;e rear &s;everal kinds of in&s;ects for the &s;ake of their &s;ilk, has long been prevalent. Dr. Lett&s;om propo&s;es a query on this &s;ubject, "Which &s;pecies of moth or butterfly is it, the caterpillar of which, in China, affords that &s;trong grey kind of &s;ilk, and how is it manufactured or wore? How are the&s;e &s;ilk worms or caterpillars pre&s;erved, fed, and managed? The introduction of &s;uch a new &s;ilk into England would be it u&s;eful acqui&s;tion, and redeem entomology from the cen&s;ure it is now branded with, of being a mere curio&s;ity, void of any real utility<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Naturali&s;t and Traveller's Companion, 1774.</NOTE>." If <HI>Le&s;&s;er</HI> and <HI>Lyonet</HI> are to be relied on, The <HI>Theologie des In&s;ectes</HI> an&s;wers this query. "At this day there are to be found in China, in the province of Canton, &s;ilk worms in a wild &s;tate, which, without any care being taken of them, make in the woods a kind of &s;ilk which the inhabitants afterwards gather from the trees. It is grey, without lu&s;tre, and is u&s;ed to make a very thick and &s;trong cloth, named there Kien Tcheon. It may be wa&s;hed like linen cloth, and does not &s;tain." A Gentleman re&s;ident in the Ea&s;t Indies, &s;peaks of a large Phalaena, producing &s;ilk in that country. "We have a beautiful &s;ilk worm north-ea&s;t of Bengal, that feeds on the Ricinus, whence I call it Phalaena Ricini: it is &s;ea green, with &s;oft &s;pines, very large, and voracious, and &s;pins a coar&s;e, but &s;trong and u&s;eful &s;ilk. The moth is of great &s;ize, with elegant dark plumage.&mdash;Is it known to European Naturali&s;ts?"&mdash;<HI>In a collection of papers published by</HI> Dr. ANDERSON, <HI>in</HI> MADRAS, 1788, 1789.&mdash;M. Le Bon, Reaumur, Roe&s;el, and &s;everal others, have attempted to weave the &s;ilk of &s;piders, as a &s;ub&s;titute for that of &s;ilk worms, but their experiments rather amu&s;e, and point out the ingenuity of the propo&s;ers, than promi&s;e to be u&s;eful; for after many trials, it appears that the &s;ilk of &s;piders would be inferior in lu&s;tre, and far more expen&s;ive than that of &s;ilk worms. Sir G. Staunton alludes to the&s;e experiments in his de&s;crip|tion of the Java fore&s;ts. "In &s;ome open &s;pots were found webs of &s;piders, woven with threads of &s;o &s;trong a texture, as not ea&s;ily to be divided without a cutting in&s;trument; they &s;eemed to render fea&s;ible the idea of him, who, in the &s;outhern provinces of Europe, propo&s;ed a manufacture from &s;piders' threads; which is &s;o ridiculous to the eyes of tho&s;e who have only viewed the flim&s;y webs &s;uck in&s;ects &s;pin in England."&mdash;Many other &s;ub&s;tances of a &s;oft texture have al&s;o been wrought into a variety of trifling articles, as gloves, &s;tockings, &amp;c. of the fibres of A&s;be&s;tos earth, or mountain flax, beard of the large <HI>Pinna</HI> &s;hell, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P></NOTE>. Sir. G. Staunton &s;peaks of the culture of &s;ilk worms in China, but only of the common &s;ort. It will gratify curio&s;ity, if not prove advantageous, &s;hould future obververs a&s;certain what kind of
<PB REF="127">in&s;ect the Chine&s;e appropriate to making &s;ilk, and whether P. Atlas is of the number, as has been conjectured.</P>

<P>This in&s;ect is de&s;cribed by Fabricius, and in conformity with his new &s;y&s;tem, is termed <HI>Ac&s;hna cla|vata</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fabricius divides the&s;e two families of Linnaean Libellulae into three di&s;tinct genera; the fir&s;t retains the Linnaean name, the &s;econd and third are called Ae&s;hna and Agrion. Their mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential chara&s;ters are taken from the form and &s;ituation of the mouth, and therefore require a deep magnifier to determine then with accuracy. We have examined tho&s;e parts in the greater number of the &s;pecies Fabricius has de&s;cribed, and find his characters agree, except in one in&s;tance; but, which alone proves the impracticability of adopting the whole of his &s;y&s;tem: he de&s;cribes <HI>Libellula Chinen&s;is,</HI> and refers to the only figure that has been given of it, in one of the plates of Edwards's Natural Hi&s;tory of Birds, 1745. Had he ever &s;een and examined this rare &s;pecies, he mu&s;t have referred it to his genus <HI>Agrion,</HI> each of the lips being bi&s;id, or two-cle&s;t, as in Libellula virgo and puella,&mdash;the e&s;&s;ential characteristic of the genus Agrion; for the mouths of the Libellulae of Fabricius differ altogether in &s;tructure, and are not notched in the &s;lighte&s;t degree, as Libellula clavata, ferruginea, 6 maculata, and the European &s;pecies Libellula depre&s;&s;a, will &s;ufficiently illu&s;trate.</NOTE>.

<P>This remarkable creature is peculiar to &s;ome parts of the Chine&s;e empire. It is not the large&s;t of the genus, known; yet it is of &s;ufficient magnitude to excite terror and di&s;gu&s;t. To an European, who has &s;een only the indigenous &s;piders of his own country, a &s;pecies five or &s;ix inches in length, and nearly the &s;ame in breadth, mu&s;t appear a frightful creature: Aranea Maculata &s;ometimes exceeds that &s;ize; but it has not the forbidding a&s;pect of mo&s;t in&s;ects of the &s;ame genus. The legs are unu&s;ually long, and the body &s;lender. In its general appearance, it re&s;embles &s;ome kinds of the <HI>Phalangiae</HI> that are known in Eng|land by the vulgar name <HI>Harve&s;t men,</HI> being generally &s;een about that time of the year.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that nature oftentimes adorns the mo&s;t deformed and loath&s;ome of her creatures in the riche&s;t di&s;play of colours; and this is e&s;pecially noticed in many &s;orts of &s;nakes, toads, lizards, &mdash;c. Spiders &s;eem al&s;o of this de&s;cription: to a form the mo&s;t hideous we frequently find united a brilliance of colours, and elegance of marking, that is &s;carcely excelled by any of the butterfly tribe,&mdash;the mo&s;t beautiful of all lepidopterous in&s;ects. Our pre&s;ent &s;ubject is a &s;triking proof of the latter part of this ob&s;ervation. The three figures in our plate of Aranca Maculata exhibit a front and a profile view of the in&s;ect, together with the front of the head at the third figure. The head is furni&s;hed with two very &s;trong black mandi|bles, each terminated in an extremely acute point. The fore part of the thorax, which is wholly of a fine &s;ilky appearance, and the colour of &s;ilver, bending over the mandibles in the form of an arch, or circular head-piece, give it the re&s;emblance of a black head with a crown of &s;ilver on the brow. This appearance is heightened in no &s;mall degree by three rugged prominences, one in the centre, and another on each &s;ide, on the upper part; and by the minute black eyes, which, like tho&s;e of mo&s;t &s;piders, &s;parkle with the lu&s;tre
<PB REF="138">of &s;mall gems. The&s;e eyes are eight in number, four are placed immediately in the front of the &s;ilver-coloured circular front piece, and on each &s;ide are two more at equal di&s;tances, but rather in oblique positions.</P>
<P>The body is really beautiful, the chief colour is deep brown, &s;trongly tinged with bright purple; a broad &s;tripe of orange colour pa&s;&s;es down the abdomen from the thorax to the apex: the whole is elegantly marked with a variety of cream-coloured lines and &s;pots inter&s;ecting each other. Very little hair is found on any part of this &s;pider except on the thorax, which being rubbed off, di&s;covers a hard te&s;taceous black &s;ub&s;tance beneath.</P>
<P>Fabricius is the only author who has de&s;cribed this in&s;ect: it has never been figured in any work what|ever, as appears by the late&s;t works of Fabricius, and our own ob&s;ervation. It is not always the mo&s;t deci&s;ive method to determine the &s;pecies from a conci&s;e de&s;cription; but this is &s;ometimes unavoidable, and in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance the de&s;cription given by Fabricius accords in every re&s;pect with our &s;pecimen. The only in&s;ect with which it could po&s;&s;ibly be confounded is Aranea Pilipes, which al&s;o has never been figured; it differs however from Aranea Maculata in the very hairy clothing of the legs, and it has al&s;o two &s;ilver &s;tripes down the back: a &s;triking &s;pecific di&s;tinction to &s;eparate it from our in&s;ect. It is al&s;o a native of the Ea&s;t Indies, but not of China, that we are informed.</P>

<P>The Linnaean <HI>Cancri</HI> are numerous, and include many &s;pecies not le&s;s &s;ingular in appearance than the extraordinary creature before us. Indeed, &s;ome &s;pecies are &s;o extremely different from the re&s;t, both in &s;tructure and manners of life, that we cannot he&s;itate in concluding the Linnaean character of the genus defective and indefinite. This may be ob&s;erved in &s;everal of the &s;pecies Linnaeus him&s;elf de&s;cribed, and throughout a more exten&s;ive number of tho&s;e di&s;covered &s;ince the time of that author. It is evident Linnaeus could never reconcile the &s;ubdivi&s;ions of the two principal families; the <HI>Brachyuri</HI> and <HI>Macrouri;</HI> or crabs with &s;hort and long tails; and later naturali&s;ts have ventured, with propriety, to alter this part of his arrangement. The <HI>Pagarus, Hippa, Scyllaris, A&s;tacus, Squilla,</HI> and <HI>Gammarus,</HI> are &s;o many new genera, formed of the Linnaean tribes of <HI>Cancri</HI> in the la&s;t Sy&s;tem of Fabricius. The genus, to which Fabricius retains the name <HI>Cancer,</HI> is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t, by having four &s;hort filiform antennae; with the extreme articulation bifid, as we ob&s;erve in the preceding &s;pecies. This author follows Degeer in de&s;cribing the Cancer Mantis, and alters the generic name to Squilla: he ob&s;erves, that this genus is entirely di&s;tinct from the <HI>Cancri,</HI> and we are of the &s;ame opinion, but adhere to the Linnaean genera, be|cau&s;e the &s;pecies, <HI>Mantis,</HI> was de&s;cribed by Linnaeus, and it may be improper therefore to remove it, to a new genus, in any partial &s;urvey of his &s;y&s;tem.

<P>Travellers agree that the temperate parts of A&s;ia would be a terre&s;trial paradi&s;e, were it not for the multitude of trouble&s;ome in&s;ects and reptiles with which they are infe&s;ted. In a well cultivated country, like China, many of the&s;e creatures can &s;scarcely find &s;helter; but &s;uch as harbour in the walls or furniture of human dwellings are as abundant in that, as any other country that lies within or near the tropics. Among&s;t the latter, none produce more terrible effects than the Centipede, who&s;e poi&s;on is as venomous as that of the &s;corpion, which al&s;o is a native of China.</P>
<P>Sir G. Staunton mentions a remarkable circum&s;tance that occurred during the late emba&s;&s;y to China. The amba&s;&s;ador and his &s;uite were accommodated in a temple near the &s;uburbs of Tong-choo-foo. "In &s;ome of the apartments the prie&s;ts had &s;uffered &s;corpions and &s;colopendras to harbour through neglect. The&s;e noi&s;ome creatures were known only by de&s;cription to &s;ome of the gentlemen in the emba&s;&s;y, who had not vi&s;ited the &s;outhern parts of Europe: the &s;ight of &s;uch, for the fir&s;t time, excited a degree of hor|ror in their minds; and it &s;eemed to them to be a &s;ufficient objection to the country, that it produced the&s;e animals." Sir George however adds, that no accident happened in that in&s;tance.&mdash;The &s;pecies of Scolopendra he alludes to, is probably <HI>Mor&s;itans,</HI> which is common in many parts of the world, but is par|ticularly &s;ound of a frightful &s;ize, and in va&s;t abundance, in the two Indies.</P>
<P><PB REF="145">Many authors have de&s;cribed this creature. In the voluminous works of Seba we find &s;everal &s;peci|mens of it from different countries, differing materially in &s;ize, and &s;ome trifling particulars, but all po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing the di&s;tingui&s;hing characters of Scolopendra Mor&s;itans. The large&s;t of the&s;e exceed our figure in magnitude, being near fourteen inches in length: this he calls <HI>Millepeda major</HI> ex nova Hi&s;pania. His figure of <HI>Millepeda Africanae</HI> is about the &s;ize of our Chine&s;e &s;pecimen. He has al&s;o a third and fourth figure, <HI>Millepeda Orientalis</HI> and <HI>Millepeda Celonica, mas:</HI> the latter is the &s;ame length as our figure, but the body is very narrow. Millepeda Orientalis is al&s;o the &s;ame length, but the body is very broad. Some of the&s;e in&s;ects are not four inches in length.</P>
<P>Authors agree that they vary exceedingly in &s;ize<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">The&s;e creatures differ from mo&s;t in&s;ects in their manner of growth, in&s;omuch that it it impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain when they are of their full &s;ize. The &s;egments of the body increa&s;e as they advance in age, which circum&s;tance renders it difficult oftentimes to determine the &s;pe|cies, without a minute examination of its other characters.</NOTE> and colour. De Geer de&s;cribes them to be &s;ome|times deep reddi&s;h brown; at others the colour of yellow ochre. The figure in Cate&s;by's Natural Hi&s;tory of Carolina is light brown; we have &s;pecimens of a livid yellow, and have &s;een others &s;trongly tinged with red.</P>
<P>The la&s;t pair of legs are con&s;iderably larger than the others, and are armed with &s;mall black &s;pines. The legs terminate in very &s;harp hooks or nails of a &s;hining black colour. All the other legs are al&s;o fur|ni&s;hed with a &s;maller nail of the &s;ame &s;hape and colour.</P>
<P>M. Gronovius &s;ays that all its feet are very venemous; but the mo&s;t formidable of its weapons are the two &s;harp, hooked in&s;truments that are placed under the mouth, and with which it de&s;troys its prey.</P>
<P>Lewenhoeck having examined the&s; in&s;truments with a micro&s;cope, he found a &s;mall opening at the extremity of each, and a channel from them into the body of the creature. Through this channel he &s;up|po&s;ed po&s;es the Scolopendra emits the poi&s;onous fluid into the wound it makes with the hooked in&s;trument. That author further remarks, that he has &s;een a liquor on that part of living &s;colopendras. A figure of the&s;e in&s;truments on the under &s;ide of the head, is repre&s;ented in one of the di&s;&s;ections in our plate.</P>
<P>The &s;ame author, wi&s;hing to a&s;certain the influence of the poi&s;on of Scolopendra mor&s;itans, placed a large fly within its reach. The Scolopendra at fir&s;t took it between a pair of its middle feet, then pa&s;&s;ed it from one pair of feet to the next, till the fly was brought under the &s;harp pointed in&s;trument or crotchets at the head, which it plunged into the fly, and it died in&s;tantly. Notwith&s;tanding this experi|ment, De Geer, Cate&s;by, and other authors, a&s;&s;ert, that its bite &s;eldom proves fatal to larger animals; but all agree that its poi&s;on is as dangerous as that of the &s;corpion.</P>
<P>This Scolopendra has eight eyes: they are very &s;mall; four are placed on each &s;ide of the head near the antennae. In the di&s;&s;ections a figure is given to exhibit the manner in which the four eyes are placed on one &s;ide.</P>
