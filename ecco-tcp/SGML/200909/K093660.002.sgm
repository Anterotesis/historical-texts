<HEAD>N^o XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>MELISSA was the daughter of a weak indulgent mother, who was left a young widow with two children; &s;he had a hand&s;ome per&s;on, a tolerable fortune and good natural parts; uncontrouled in her education, &s;he was permitted to indulge her&s;elf in &s;tudies of a ro|mantic turn, and before &s;he compleated her &s;ix|teenth year was to be found in all the circles of prating &s;entimentali&s;ts, who fill the &s;illy heads of young women with female friend&s;hip and pla|tonic love.</P>
<P>The ordinary plea&s;ures and accompli&s;hments of her own &s;ex were below the notice of Meli&s;&s;a; from the tumult of a noi&s;y country-dance &s;he revolted with horror, as from the orgies of Bac|chus; a &s;oul of her &s;eraphic ca&s;t could not de|&s;cend to the vulgar employment of the needle,
<PB N="2" REF="7">
and the ornaments of dre&s;s claimed no &s;hare in the attention of a being &s;o engaged in &s;tudies of a &s;ublimer &s;ort: She loved mu&s;ic, but they were plaintive Lydian airs with dying cadences, war|bled by &s;ome female friend at the &s;ide of a rivu|let, or under the &s;hade of an arbour; and if the &s;ummer zephyrs murmured to the melody, it was &s;o much the better for Meli&s;&s;a; then &s;he would &s;it rapt in pen&s;ive plea&s;ure with the hand of her friend fa&s;t clo&s;ed in her's, and call it the &s;oul's harmony: To the&s;e nymph-like retirements that filthy &s;atyr man was never admitted; he was not thought or &s;poken of but with terror and aver|&s;ion: When the &s;train was fini&s;hed, &s;he would break out into &s;ome poetic rhap&s;ody upon <HI>friend|&s;hip, contemplation, night,</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch &s;ubject, which her memory &s;upplied her with very rea|dily on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the mean time the impertinence of &s;uitors occa&s;ionally interrupted the more refined enjoy|ments of Meli&s;&s;a's &s;oul: One of the&s;e was a gentleman of good birth, con&s;iderable fortune, and an unexceptionable character; but the florid health of the robu&s;t creature was an in&s;uperable objection, and having ca&s;ually let fall a hint that he was fond of hunting, &s;he di&s;mi&s;t him to his vulgar &s;ports with a becoming di&s;dain: Her &s;e|cond &s;uitor was a hand&s;ome young officer the
<PB N="3" REF="8">
cadet of a noble hou&s;e; this attack was carried on very bri&s;kly, and Meli&s;&s;a was only &s;aved from the horrors of matrimony by luckily di&s;covering that her lover was &s;o devoid of ta&s;te and under|&s;tanding, as to profe&s;s a preference for that rake Tom Jones before the moral Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on; &s;uch a &s;in again&s;t &s;entiment would have been enough to have undone him for ever with Meli&s;&s;a, if no other objection had ari&s;en; but this being followed up with many like in&s;tances of bad ta&s;te in the belles-lettres, he was peremp|torily di&s;carded: A third offer came from a man of high rank and fortune, and was pre&s;&s;ed upon her by her mother with much earne&s;t &s;olicita|tion; for in fact it was a very advantageous pro|po&s;al; the lover was polite, good-natured, ge|nerous and of an amiable character, but in the unguarded warmth of his heart he let fall the di&s;tant expre&s;&s;ion of a hope, that he might have an heir to his e&s;tate and titles; the &s;en&s;uality of which idea was &s;uch a gro&s;s affront to the deli|cate Meli&s;&s;a, that he, like the others, was &s;ent off with a refu&s;al.</P>
<P>The report of the&s;e rebuffs &s;et Meli&s;&s;a free from any future &s;olicitations, and it appeared as if &s;he was de&s;tined to enjoy a &s;abbath of virginity for the re&s;t of her days: So many years elap&s;ed, that &s;he now began to tread the down-hill path
<PB N="4" REF="9">
of life, grew &s;latternly and took &s;nuff: Still the gentle pa&s;&s;ion of friend&s;hip did not abate, her at|tachment for Partheni&s;&s;a grew clo&s;er than ever, and if by evil accident the&s;e tender companions were &s;eparated for a day, eight &s;ides of letter-paper could not contain the effu&s;ions of their affection.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have told the reader that Meli&s;&s;a had a &s;i&s;ter &s;ome years younger than her&s;elf, brought up from her childhood by a maiden aunt, who was what the polite world calls in contempt a good &s;ort of woman, &s;o that poor Maria was educated accordingly, and ju&s;tly held in &s;ove|reign contempt for her vulgar endowments by Meli&s;&s;a; there were other trifling rea&s;ons which helped to put her out of favour with her more accompli&s;hed &s;i&s;ter; for, as I have already hint|ed, &s;he was &s;everal years younger, and in &s;ome opinions rather hand&s;omer; they &s;eldom met however and never corre&s;ponded, for Maria had no &s;tile and little &s;entiment; &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her own caps, mended her own linen, and took charge of her aunt's hou&s;ehold: It was therefore with &s;ome degree of &s;urprize, that Meli&s;&s;a received the news of Maria's being on the point of marrying a nobleman, and that &s;urprize was probably en|hanced upon hearing, that this noble per&s;on was the very man, who &s;ome years ago had vainly
<PB N="5" REF="10">
a&s;pired to &s;olicit the impregnable Meli&s;&s;a her&s;elf: If &s;he turned pale upon the receipt of this intel|ligence, eat no dinner that day and took no &s;leep that night, candour will impute it to the exce&s;s of Meli&s;&s;a's &s;en&s;ibility and the kind intere&s;t &s;he took in the happy pro&s;pect of her &s;i&s;ter's mar|riage; but a cen&s;orious world gives &s;trange interpretations, and &s;ome people were ready enough to &s;ay ill-natured things on the occa|&s;ion; the behaviour of that amiable lady &s;oon confuted &s;uch in&s;inuations, for &s;he immediately &s;et out for her aunt's, where Maria was receiv|ing his lord&s;hip's vi&s;its every day, and where Meli&s;&s;a's pre&s;ence mu&s;t have greatly added to the felicity of both parties.</P>
<P>Her preparations for this vi&s;it were &s;uch as &s;he had never made before, for though in gene|ral &s;he was rather negligent of her dre&s;s, &s;he put her art to the utmo&s;t &s;tretch on this occa&s;ion, and left no effort untried that might do credit to her &s;i&s;ter by &s;etting off her own appearance in his lord&s;hip's eyes upon the meeting: Whil&s;t &s;he gave her per&s;on full di&s;play &s;he did not &s;pare her wit, and to make up for the taciturnity of Maria kept my lord in full di&s;cour&s;e all the time he &s;taid; &s;he likewi&s;e from her love of information &s;et Maria right in many particulars, which that young lady through want of education was igno|rant
<PB N="6" REF="11">
of, and plainly &s;hewed the lover, that there was &s;ome under&s;tanding in the family on her part at lea&s;t, whatever the deficiency might be where he had fixt his choice.</P>
<P>Whether it was owing to the&s;e &s;i&s;terly en|deavours of Meli&s;&s;a, or to what other cau&s;e does not appear, but it &s;hould &s;eem as if my lord's attention to Maria grew &s;tronger in proportion as Meli&s;&s;a &s;trove to attract it towards her&s;elf; and upon her hinting with &s;ome degree of rail|lery at what had formerly pa&s;&s;ed between them, his lord&s;hip looked her &s;teadily in the face for &s;ome moments, then turned his eyes upon her &s;i&s;ter, and &s;ilently walked out of the room.</P>
<P>As it is not to be &s;u&s;pected, that Meli&s;&s;a, with a &s;oul &s;uperior to all vulgar pa&s;&s;ions, could be envious of &s;o mean a rival as Maria, it is not ea&s;y to account for the &s;udden change of her be|haviour to the noble &s;uitor on his next vi&s;it to her &s;i&s;ter: In&s;tead of tho&s;e &s;tudied attentions &s;he had paid him at their fir&s;t meeting, &s;he now in|du&s;triou&s;ly took no notice of him, and &s;ate rapt in her own happy meditations; till upon his pre&s;enting to her &s;i&s;ter a magnificent &s;uit of jewels, the lu&s;tre of tho&s;e &s;parkling gems &s;o daz|zled her &s;ight, that the tears &s;tarted in her eyes, the colour fled from her cheeks, and &s;he hurried
<PB N="7" REF="12">
out of the room in evident perturbation of &s;pi|rit.</P>
<P>Upon entering her bedchamber &s;he di&s;covered on her toilette a pacquet from her beloved Par|theni&s;&s;a; nothing was ever &s;o &s;ea&s;onable; &s;he &s;natched it up with eagerne&s;s, ha&s;tily broke it open, ki&s;&s;ed it, and began to read. This valu|able manu&s;cript was rather of the longe&s;t; it &s;et out with a great deal of ingenious ridicule at the expence of the fond couple on the point of mar|riage; then digre&s;&s;ed into an animated de&s;crip|tion of the more refined enjoyments of female friend&s;hip, and concluded as follows:
<LETTER>
<P>After all I have been &s;aying, how &s;hall I gain credit with Meli&s;&s;a, and what will &s;he think of her friend, when I tell her, that I have at la&s;t met with one of the male &s;ex, who is not ab&s;olutely di&s;agreeable! perhaps I might even add, that Count Ranceval is &s;o amiable a man, that were I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Meli&s;&s;a's charms&mdash;but whither am I running? He is rich, generous, and of noble rank.&mdash;And what are the&s;e but feathers, you will &s;ay?&mdash;True, yet &s;uch feathers have their weight in the world's &s;cale.&mdash;Well, but Meli&s;&s;a is above the world.&mdash;No matter; &s;till it is a galling thing to yield precedence to a chit like Maria: What, tho' nature has endowed you with pre-eminence of
<PB N="8" REF="13">
talents, tho' your &s;oul moves in a &s;uperior &s;phere to her's, &s;till you know re&s;pect will fol|low rank; but Counte&s;s Ranceval would &s;et all to rights, and keep your natural &s;uperiority unque&s;tioned&mdash;So now the mi&s;chief's out; you have my heart upon my paper.</P>
<P>You will wonder what &s;hould bring a noble &s;tranger into &s;o ob&s;cure a corner of the world as ours: Health, my dear, is the Count's pre|tence: He may give Meli&s;&s;a probably a better rea&s;on, but this is the often&s;ible one; and cer|tainly he is of a &s;lim and delicate habit; he &s;eems to be all &s;oul and &s;entiment; nothing earthy or corporeal about him: A compleat ma&s;ter of the Engli&s;h language, and well ver&s;ed in our Engli&s;h authors, particularly the dramatic ones, of who&s;e works he is pa&s;&s;ion|ately fond. If our Dor&s;et&s;hire downs and gen|tle exerci&s;e re&s;tore his health, he is &s;oon to leave us, unle&s;s Meli&s;&s;a's company &s;hould de|tain him, for his father, the old Count, writes pre&s;&s;ing letters for him to return to Stra&s;bourg, of which city he is a native, and of the fir&s;t family in it. He lodges in our hou&s;e with my uncle with one valet-de-chambre only, having left his &s;ervants in town, as our family could not receive his &s;uite.</P>
<P>He is impatient to be known to you, and I
<PB N="9" REF="14">
&s;uppo&s;e you think I have &s;aid all the fine things in the world to make him &s;o; not I, believe me; on the contrary I have not &s;pared for abu&s;e, whenever you was talked of, for I have let him fully into your character; I have fairly warned him what he is to look for, if he pre|&s;umes to make love to you; for that you are the mo&s;t inexorable, exceptious, determined &s;pin&s;ter in England. Now as I know you love a little contradiction at your heart, you have a fair opportunity to come hither without delay and di&s;prove all I have been &s;aying of you: But if you had rather be the bride-maid to Lady L. than the bride of Count Ranceval, &s;tay where you are, and enjoy the elegant pa&s;|time of throwing the &s;tocking and drawing plumb-cake through the wedding-ring.</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Farewell.</SALUTE>

</LETTER></P>
<P>If the gentle &s;pirits of Meli&s;&s;a were &s;omewhat fluttered by what had pa&s;&s;ed before &s;he took up this letter from her friend, they were con&s;iderably more &s;o, when &s;he laid it down: After ponder|ing for a time in deep meditation on its contents, &s;he &s;tarted up, took &s;everal turns in her chamber, &s;ate down again, then adju&s;ted her dre&s;s, then ran to the gla&s;s, looked at her&s;elf, put her cap in order, and at la&s;t rang the bell with great vio|lence
<PB N="10" REF="15">
for her &s;ervant; her fir&s;t re&s;olution had been to order her chai&s;e in&s;tantly to be made ready and return home; the&s;e were the natural dictates of friend&s;hip; but upon her woman's entering the room a &s;econd thought &s;truck her and alarmed her delicacy, le&s;t Partheni&s;&s;a &s;hould impute her immediate compliance to any other, than the pure motives of affection and good-nature: This thought exceedingly embarra&s;&s;ed her; however after &s;everal contradictory re&s;olu|tions, &s;he finally directed her &s;ervant to order the equipage and put things in train for her depar|ture without delay.</P>
<P>The bu&s;tle, which this &s;udden order of Me|li&s;&s;a occa&s;ioned in the family, &s;oon brought Ma|ria into her chamber, who with much anxiety enquired into the cau&s;e of her ha&s;ty departure; Meli&s;&s;a having again fallen into a profound re|verie gave no an&s;wer to this enquiry; upon which Maria repeated it, adding that &s;he hoped her mo|ther was well and that the letter brought no bad news from home.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My mother is well and the letter brings no bad news from home,"</Q>
an&s;wered Meli&s;&s;a.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then I hope, &s;i&s;ter,"</Q> &s;ays Maria,<Q REND="inline">"nothing has happened here to give you any offence."</Q>&mdash;Meli&s;&s;a looked her &s;teadily in the face, and after &s;ome time relaxed her features into that &s;ort of &s;mile, which con&s;cious &s;uperi|ority
<PB N="11" REF="16">
&s;ometimes deigns to be&s;tow upon impor|tunate in&s;ignificance. Maria, in who&s;e compo|&s;ition the inflammable particles did not predo|minate, an&s;wered this &s;mile of in&s;ult no otherwi&s;e than by a blu&s;h of &s;en&s;ibility, and with a faulter|ing voice &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If it is I, who am in the fault, &s;i&s;ter, I am heartily &s;orry for it, and entreat you to believe that nothing can be further from my intentions, than to give you ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence at any time."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Lord, child,"</Q> re|plied Meli&s;&s;a with infinite compo&s;ure,<Q REND="inline">"how vanity has turned thy poor head up&s;ide down: I dare &s;ay you think it mighty pretty to prac|ti&s;e the airs of a great lady and to be gracious to your inferiors; but have the goodne&s;s to &s;tay till I am your inferior; perhaps that may never be the ca&s;e; perhaps&mdash;but I &s;hall &s;ay no more upon the &s;ubject; it is not your childi&s;h triumph in di&s;playing a parcel of baubles, that can move me; no&mdash;you might recollect me|thinks that tho&s;e diamonds had been mine, if I would have taken them with the incum|brance appertaining to them&mdash;but I look higher, be a&s;&s;ured, &s;o I wi&s;h your lady&s;hip a good morning, for I &s;ee my chai&s;e is waiting."</Q>&mdash;Having thus &s;aid, the accompli&s;hed Meli&s;&s;a without &s;taying for an an&s;wer, flounced out of the room, took a ha&s;ty leave of her aunt below
<PB N="12" REF="17">

<P>THE amiable Meli&s;&s;a having performed the duties of a &s;i&s;ter in the manner above re|lated, eagerly flew to enjoy the delights of a friend, and upon her return home immediately betook her&s;elf to her beloved Partheni&s;&s;a. It &s;o happened that &s;he found that young lady <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> with Count Ranceval; Meli&s;&s;a, upon di&s;|covering a &s;tranger with her friend, &s;tarted back, blu&s;hed and ha&s;tily exclaimed&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ble&s;s me!

She was now retiring, when Partheni&s;&s;a by gentle compul&s;ion obliged her to return: The conver|&s;ation &s;oon grew intere&s;ting, in the cour&s;e of which many fine things were &s;aid by the Count, of which nothing was original but the applica|tion, for they were mo&s;tly to be found in the prompter's library. Whil&s;t Meli&s;&s;a was amu&s;ing her friend with an account of what had pa&s;&s;ed at her aunt's, the Count &s;ate for &s;ome time &s;ilent

<P>This rhap&s;ody was &s;econded by another em|brace more ardent than the former: Partheni&s;&s;a then took her turn, and &s;aluting her friend, cried out&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Joy to you, my deare&s;t Counte&s;s; all joy befall you both."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Now,"</Q> &s;ays Count Ran|ceval,<Q REND="inline">"my beloved Meli&s;&s;a has a right in every thing I po&s;&s;e&s;s, and her friend will no longer oppo&s;e the tender of that trifling &s;um; it is an earne&s;t, that &s;eals our engagement; the form, that is to follow, cannot make us one more firmly, than honour now unites us; and con&s;i|dering you now already as the daughter-in-law of this noble father, I mu&s;t beg leave to &s;hew you what his letter further contains."</Q>&mdash;He then produced bills of exchange, which the old Count had remitted for very con&s;iderable &s;ums.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The purpo&s;e of this remittance,"</Q> &s;ays he,<Q REND="inline">"is to purcha&s;e a &s;et of jewels in addition to the family &s;tock of a newer fa&s;hion with a recommendation to be&s;tow them upon &s;ome Engli&s;h woman, if I &s;hould be happy enough to engage the affection of &s;uch an one in this kingdom, and behold how the de&s;cription of my father's wi&s;h tallies with the adorable per&s;on, who has now honoured me with her hand!"</Q>&mdash;He then read the following paragraph

<P>The union of this happy couple being thus decided upon, no time was to be lo&s;t in carrying it into effect, for the Count was ha&s;tening home|wards,
<PB N="20" REF="25">
and Meli&s;&s;a had no objection to be before|hand with her &s;i&s;ter: Of her mother there was no doubt to be had, or, if there was, her fortune was in her own power, and &s;he of full age to chu&s;e for her&s;elf. Secrecy however was re&s;olved upon for various rea&s;ons, and the joy of &s;urpriz|ing Maria was not among&s;t the lea&s;t. The uncle of Partheni&s;&s;a, who was an attorney, was in|&s;tructed to make a &s;hort deed, referring it to the old Count at Stra&s;bourg to compleat Meli&s;&s;a's &s;ettlement, when &s;he arrived at that city; this worthy gentleman was accordingly let into the &s;ecret, and at the &s;ame time undertook to get the licence and to prepare the par&s;on of Meli&s;&s;a's pari&s;h for the ceremony. The adju&s;ting &s;o many particulars drew the bu&s;ine&s;s into &s;uch length, that the evening was now far &s;pent, and as Me|li&s;&s;a was in the habit of &s;haring occa&s;ionally the bed of her beloved friend, &s;he di&s;patched a me&s;|&s;enger to her mother, &s;ignifying that &s;he &s;hould &s;leep at Partheni&s;&s;a's that night.</P>
<P>When this matter was &s;ettled, Partheni&s;&s;a quitted the room to give her orders for &s;upper, and the happy lovers were left to them&s;elves for no incon&s;iderable time. The enamoured Count lo&s;t not a moment of this precious interval, and with the help of Dryden, Otway, and Rowe kept up his rhap&s;odies with great &s;pirit: Now
<PB N="21" REF="26">
it was that love, which Meli&s;&s;a had &s;o long kept at di&s;tance, took full revenge, and, like a griping creditor, exacted his arrears with ample intere&s;t from his vanqui&s;hed debtor. When Partheni&s;&s;a returned &s;he &s;trove to make her pre&s;ence as little interruption as po&s;&s;ible to the&s;e tender endear|ments, by rallying Meli&s;&s;a on her prudery, and frequently reminding her, that contracted lovers were in effect man and wife; in &s;hort, nothing could be more con&s;iderate and accommodating than this amiable friend.</P>
<P>An elegant but &s;mall repa&s;t was now &s;erved, at which no dome&s;tic was admitted; the Count was in the happie&s;t flow of &s;pirits; Meli&s;&s;a's heart could not re&s;i&s;t the fe&s;tivity of the moment, and all was love and gaiety, till night was far &s;pent and the hour reminded them of &s;epara|ting. Partheni&s;&s;a again retired to prepare her chamber, and Meli&s;&s;a was again left with her lover. How it came to pa&s;s that Partheni&s;&s;a omitted &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a point of ceremony, as that of informing Meli&s;&s;a when her chamber was rea|dy, I cannot pretend to account, but &s;o it was, and that young lady, with a negligence, which friend&s;hip is &s;ometimes apt to contract, retired to her repo&s;e, and never thought more of poor Meli&s;&s;a, who was left in a &s;ituation very new to her, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it, but who had &s;weetne&s;s
<PB N="22" REF="27">
of temper neverthele&s;s to let her friend off with a very gentle reproof, when after a long time pa&s;t in expectation of her coming, &s;he was at length obliged to &s;ubmit to the impropriety of &s;uffering Count Ranceval to conduct her to her bed-chamber door.</P>
<P>The next day produced the licence and Me|li&s;&s;a was, or appeared to be, as impatient to con|clude the ceremony as Count Ranceval him&s;elf. This is to be imputed to the timid &s;en&s;ibility of her nature, which rather wi&s;hed to precipitate an awful act, than to remain in terror and &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Awful as it was to Meli&s;&s;a, it was au&s;picious to the happy Count, for it put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his amiable bride. The mother was let into the &s;ecret and with joy con&s;ented to give Meli&s;&s;a away, and receive Counte&s;s Ranceval in return. The matter pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ecret as to the neighbour|hood, and Partheni&s;&s;a's uncle, to accommodate the parties, &s;ate up all night to compleat the deed, which gave the Count po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lady's fortune, and referred her for a &s;ettlement to be made at Stra&s;bourg in the barony of La|va&s;ques.</P>
<P>A very happy company were now a&s;&s;embled at dinner, con&s;i&s;ting of the bride and bride|groom, Partheni&s;&s;a, her uncle and the old lady, when a coach and &s;ix drove to the door, and, as
<PB N="23" REF="28">
if fortune had determined to compleat the do|me&s;tic felicity of this family in the &s;ame mo|ment, Maria, who was now Lady L&mdash;, fol|lowed by her aunt and his lord&s;hip, ran into the room, and falling on her knee, a&s;ked ble&s;&s;ing of her mother, whil&s;t Lord L&mdash; pre&s;ented him|&s;elf as her &s;on-in-law, having driven from the church door to her hou&s;e to pay his duty on this occa&s;ion, meaning to return directly, for which purpo&s;e the equipage was ordered to wait.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Maria approached to embrace Meli&s;&s;a and to pre&s;ent to her a very fine bridal favour, embroidered with pearls, Count Ranceval whi&s;|pered his lovely bride, that he mu&s;t ha&s;tily retire; being &s;uddenly &s;eized with a violent attack of the tooth-ach; being a perfect man of fa&s;hion, he contrived to retire without di&s;turbing the com|pany, and putting up his handkerchief to his face to prevent the cold air affecting the part in pain, ran up to his lady's bed-chamber, whil&s;t Partheni&s;&s;a and her uncle very con&s;iderately re|tired from a family party, in which they were no longer intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>Meli&s;&s;a received the bridal favour from Maria with a conde&s;cending inclination of her body, without ri&s;ing from her &s;eat.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t per|mit me, &s;i&s;ter,"</Q>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Good heavens!"</Q> exclaimed Maria,<Q REND="inline">"how delighted am I to hear you have married a man of &s;uch rank and fortune! What a ble&s;|&s;ing to my mother, to me, to my lord!"</Q>&mdash;So &s;aying, &s;he threw her arms round her neck and embraced her, &s;he next embraced her mother, and turning to Lord L&mdash;, &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My lord, you will congratulate the Counte&s;s."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I hope &s;o,"</Q>
replied Lord L&mdash;,<Q REND="inline">"every thing that contributes to the happine&s;s of this hou&s;e will be matter of congratulation for me; but let me a&s;k where Count Ranceval is; I &s;hall be proud to pay my compliments to him, and by the glimp&s;e I had of his per&s;on think I have had the honour of &s;eeing him before."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Very likely,"</Q> an&s;wered Meli&s;&s;a,<Q REND="inline">"the Count has been &s;ome time in London."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I think

<P>So &s;aying, he followed Meli&s;&s;a up &s;tairs, and was accompanied by the whole party.

turning to Lord L&mdash;, with a look of horror, exclaimed&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What do I hear? Count Rance|val a footman!

to the divine benevolence of Maria, I will charitably drop the curtain over the fall of pride.

filtres, was the fir&s;t, who practi&s;ed &s;orcery; that from her time the Samaritans were &s;o addicted to &s;orcery, that a Samaritan and a &s;orcerer be|came one and the &s;ame term; which opinion he is confirmed in by that pa&s;&s;age in &s;cripture, where the Phari&s;ees accu&s;e Chri&s;t of being <HI>a Sa|maritan, and having a devil</HI>; a charge, &s;ays he, implied in the very fir&s;t po&s;ition of his being a Samaritan: He admits jointly with St. Au&s;tin, that Pythoni&s;&s;a, or the Witch of Endor, actually rai&s;ed the &s;pirit of Samuel, not by magic incan|tations, but by expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion of God, for the puni&s;hment of Saul's impiety, and to provoke him to immediate repentance by the denuncia|tion of his impending fate; whil&s;t other autho|rities in the church of early date maintain that it was not the &s;pirit of Samuel, but a daemon that appeared in his likene&s;s: He admits al&s;o, that the rods of the Egyptian &s;orcerers were like that of Mo&s;es turned into &s;erpents by the art and contrivance of the devil; in like manner the &s;aid magicians turned the rivers into blood and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt; but though they kept pace with Mo&s;es in producing the&s;e plagues, their power, he ob&s;erves, did not reach, as his did, to the &s;ub&s;equent extirpation of them.</P>
<P>As to Simon the magician, whom Philip con|verted
<PB N="31" REF="36">
in Samaria, wonderful things are &s;aid of him by the fathers of the Chri&s;tian church; this man, Ju&s;tin Martyr informs us, was born in the city of Gitta in Samaria, travelled to Rome in the time of Claudius, and by the aid of the devil performed &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing feats, as cau&s;ed him to be believed and wor&s;hipped as a god, the Ro|mans erecting a &s;tatue to him on the banks of the Tiber between the bridges, with this in|&s;cription, <HI>Simoni Deo Sancto.</HI> The &s;acred hi&s;to|rians record no particulars of Simon's &s;orceries; but if the reader has curio&s;ity to con&s;ult <HI>lib.</HI> 2. <HI>recognition: &amp; lib.</HI> 6. <HI>con&s;tit. Apo&s;t. in Clem. Rom.</HI> he will find many &s;trange &s;tories of this &s;orcerer, viz. That he created a man out of the air; that he had the power of being invi&s;ible; that he could render marble as penetrable as clay; animate &s;tatues; re&s;i&s;t the force of fire; pre&s;ent him&s;elf with two faces, like Janus; me|tamorpho&s;e him&s;elf into a &s;heep or a goat; fly through the air at plea&s;ure; create va&s;t &s;ums of gold in a moment and upon a wi&s;h; take a &s;cythe in his hand and mow a field of &s;tanding corn almo&s;t at a &s;troke, and bring the dead, un|ju&s;tly murdered, into life: He adds that as a fa|mous courte&s;an named Selene was looking out of a certain ca&s;tle, and a great croud had col|lected to gaze at her, he cau&s;ed her fir&s;t to ap|pear,
<PB N="32" REF="37">
and afterwards to fall down from every window at one and the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Ana&s;ta&s;ius Nicenus's account agrees in many particulars with the above, and adds, that Simon was frequently preceded by &s;pectres, which he &s;aid were the &s;pirits of certain per&s;ons decea&s;ed. I &s;hall make no further remark upon the&s;e ac|counts, except in the way of caution to readers of a certain de&s;cription, to keep in mind that the &s;criptural hi&s;tory &s;ays only&mdash;<HI>That Simon u&s;ed &s;orcery and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that him&s;elf was &s;ome great one.</HI> The eviden|ces of holy writ are &s;imple and in general terms, but the accounts of the fathers of the church go much beyond them, and the &s;uper&s;tition of the dark ages was &s;o extravagant and unbounded, that there is no end to the tales invented, or in|&s;erted in the Roman legends.</P>
<P>Though it appears from the &s;criptural ac|count that Simon was converted by Philip, the arts he had imparted to his &s;cholars did not cea&s;e in the world, but were continued by Me|nander, one of his &s;aid &s;cholars, and a Samaritan al&s;o, who practi&s;ed &s;orceries and went to An|tioch, where he deluded many people: Irenaeus relates that Marcus, another of Simon's &s;cholars, was a very powerful magician and drew many followers; that Anaxilaus pretended to cure
<PB N="33" REF="38">
madne&s;s by the &s;ame art, turned white wine into red, and prophecied by the help of a familiar; and that Carpocrates and his pupils practi&s;ed magical incantations and love-charms, and had ab&s;olute power over men's minds by the force of &s;uper&s;tition. The charge of &s;orcery became in after times &s;o &s;trong a weapon in the hands of the church of Rome, that they employed it again&s;t all in their turns, who &s;eparated them|&s;elves from the e&s;tabli&s;hed communion. When Pri&s;cillian carried the here&s;y of the Gno&s;ties into Spain he was twice brought to trial and con|victed of &s;orcery, which Severus Sulpitius in his epi&s;tle to Cte&s;iphon &s;ays he confe&s;&s;ed to have learned of Marcus the Egyptian abovemention|ed; this Pri&s;cillian was a great adept in Zoro|a&s;trian magic, and though a magician was pro|moted to the epi&s;copacy. The &s;ame Severus in his life of Saint Martin relates that there was a young man in Spain, who by fal&s;e miracles im|po&s;ed upon the people to believe he was the pro|phet Elias, afterwards he feigned him&s;elf to be Chri&s;t, and drew Rufus, though a bi&s;hop, to give credit to his bla&s;phemous impo&s;ition, and to pay him wor&s;hip accordingly. Paul the dea|con al&s;o relates that there were three other P&s;eudo-Chri&s;ts in France, one of which was a Briton, whom Gregory of Tours calls Eun
<PB N="34" REF="39">
(probably Evan) of whom Robert the Chrono|loger and William of Newberry record many miracles; all the&s;e Paul tells us were heretics.</P>
<P>In the pontificate of Innocent VI. there was one Gon&s;alvo a Spaniard in the dioce&s;e of Con|cha, who wrote a book, which he intitled <HI>Vir|ginalem,</HI> with a daemon vi&s;ibly &s;tanding at his el|bow, and dictating to him as he copied it from his mouth; in which book he announced him&s;elf to be Chri&s;t, the immortal &s;aviour of the world; this man was put to death as a heretic and bla&s;|phemer. Sergius, the author of the Armenian here&s;y, was charged with keeping a daemon in the &s;hape of a dog con&s;tantly attending upon him; and Berengarius, chief of the Sacramenta|rian here&s;y, was in like manner accu&s;ed of being a magician: Many more in&s;tances might be ad|duced, but Tertullian takes a &s;horter cour&s;e, and fairly pronounces that all heretics were ma|gicians, or had commerce with magicians.</P>
<P>The Infidels e&s;caped no better from this charge than the Heretics; for the Moors who brought many arts and inventions into Spain, of which the natives were in utter ignorance, univer&s;ally fell under the &s;ame accu&s;ation, and Martin Delrius the Je&s;uit, who taught theology in Salamanca at the clo&s;e of the &s;ixteenth cen|tury, &s;ays he was &s;hewn the place where a great
<PB N="35" REF="40">
cave had been &s;topped up in that city by order of Queen I&s;abella, which the Moors had u&s;ed for the purpo&s;es of necromancy; that the Hu&s;&s;ites in Bohemia and the followers of the arch-heretic Luther in Germany confounded men's &s;en&s;es by the power of magic and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the devil, to whom they had devoted them&s;elves; that &s;ome of them voluntarily recanted and con|fe&s;&s;ed their evil practices, and others, being &s;eiz|ed and examined at the tribunal of Treves, made like public confe&s;&s;ion, at which time, he adds&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That terrible and tartarean prop of Luther|ani&s;m, Albert of Brandeburgh, him&s;elf a no|torious magician, was in the act of laying wa&s;te that very country with fire and &s;word."</Q>&mdash;<HI>Tetrum illud et tartareum Lutherani&s;mi ful|crum, ip&s;e quoque magicae nomine famo&s;us, Albertus Brandeburgicus, provinciam illam flamm&acirc; ferro&abque; praedabundus va&s;tabat.</HI>&mdash;He adds, that wherever the here&s;y of Calvin went, whether to England, France or Holland, the black and diabolic arts of necromancy kept pace with it. That the daemons take their abode in heretics as naturally as they did in heathen idols, or in the herd of &s;wine, when commanded; nay Hieronymus de|clares that they got into wor&s;e quarters by the exchange; Ca&s;&s;ian, (<HI>Collat.</HI> 7. <HI>cap.</HI> 31.) an an|cient writer of great gravity, affirms that he had
<PB N="36" REF="41">
him&s;elf interrogated a daemon, who confe&s;&s;ed to him that he had in&s;pired Arius and Eunomius with the fir&s;t ideas of their &s;acrilegious tenets: That it is demon&s;trable by rea&s;on, that all here|tics mu&s;t in the end be either athei&s;ts or &s;orce|rers; becau&s;e here&s;y can only proceed from the pa&s;&s;ion of pride and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, which lead to athei&s;m; or from curio&s;ity and love of novelty, which incline the mind to the &s;tudy of magical arts: That &s;orcery follows here&s;y, as the plague follows famine; for here&s;y is nothing el&s;e but a famine, as de&s;cribed by the prophet Amos, chap. viii. ver&s;e 11. <HI>Not a famine of bread, nor a thir&s;t of water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.</HI>&mdash;Moreover here&s;y is a harlot, as I&s;aiah expre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf&mdash;<HI>How is the faithful city become a harlot?</HI>&mdash;And as harlots, when pa&s;t their beauty, take up the trade of procure&s;&s;es, &s;o daemons, (as the&s;e good catholics inform us) turn old and obdurate heretics into &s;orcerers: Father Maldonatus &s;ees the heretics again in the ninth chapter of the Apocalyp&s;e come out of the &s;moke in form of locu&s;ts upon the earth, and as Joel the prophet writes in the fourth ver&s;e of his fir&s;t chapter&mdash;<HI>That which the palmer-worm hath left, hath the locu&s;t eaten; and that, which the locu&s;t hath left, hath the canker-worm eaten; and that, which the canker-worm hath left, hath the caterpillar eaten.</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="37" REF="42">
So in the&s;e gradations of vermin may be &s;een the &s;tages of here&s;y, for what the heretics have left the &s;orcerers by the devil's aid have de&s;troy|ed; and what the &s;orcerers have left the athei&s;ts have de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Having &s;tated the charge, which my heretical readers will perceive is pretty general again&s;t them, I &s;hall proceed to &s;ome facts in proof. One of the mo&s;t &s;tubborn among&s;t the&s;e is the ca&s;e of an heretical woman in the town of Pa|derborn, who brought forth a male infant in a par&s;on's gown and beaver&mdash;<HI>palliatum et pileatum, modo eccle&s;ia&s;ticorum</HI>&mdash;who from his natural anti|pathy to papi&s;ts always reviled them wherever he met them; this Father Delrius a&s;&s;ures us was a fact of general notoriety, and a ju&s;t judgment from God on the here&s;y of the mother. Nide|rius in the chapter upon witches <HI>in Formicario</HI> &s;ays that an heretical young witch at Cologn, by the help of a daemon, took a handkerchief and in pre&s;ence of a great company of noble &s;pectators tore it into pieces, and immediately afterwards produced it whole and entire; this wicked jade then took up a gla&s;s, threw it again&s;t the wall, broke it into a thou&s;and fragments, and in&s;tantly &s;hewed it to the company as whole as at fir&s;t: Niderius concludes, with ju&s;t indignation again&s;t &s;uch diabolical practices, that this girl was well
<PB N="38" REF="43">
handled by the Fathers of the Inqui&s;ition, where her tricks could &s;tand her in no &s;tead; which indeed is not to be wondered at, as the devil him&s;elf would not chu&s;e to venture before that tribunal. Bodinus in his treati&s;e upon daemons relates that a conjurer named Tri&s;calinus per|formed &s;ome tricks before Charles the ninth of France, and by the black art contrived to draw into his hand &s;everal rings from the fingers of a courtier, who &s;tood at a di&s;tance from him, and that every body &s;aw the&s;e rings fly through the air to the conjurer, whereupon the whole company ri&s;ing up again&s;t him for the performance of &s;uch diabolical feats <HI>(quae nec arte, nec actu hu|mano, nec natur&acirc; fieri poterant)</HI> fell upon him and by force brought him to confe&s;s that he con|&s;pired with the devil, which at fir&s;t this hardened &s;inner was very unwilling to do; Bodinus with great candour ob&s;erves, that this was indeed a blot in the fame of Charles the ninth, who in all other re&s;pects was a prai&s;e-worthy monarch; <HI>(ali&agrave;s laudato rege.)</HI> When my readers recollect the meritorious part that Charles the ninth acted in the ma&s;&s;acre of Paris, he will own with me that the candour of Bodinus is extraordinary in producing a &s;tory &s;o much to the di&s;credit of a prai&s;e-worthy prince.</P>
<P>There was one Zedekiah a Jew phy&s;ician,

<P>HAVING in my preceding paper &s;tated &s;ome of the proofs, by which the ortho|dox theologicians make good their charge of &s;orcery again&s;t Heretics, Jews and Mahometans, and &s;hewn from their authorities, faithfully and correctly quoted, how naturally the devil and his agents take to all tho&s;e, who &s;eparate from
<PB N="42" REF="47">
the mother church of Rome; having al&s;o briefly deduced the hi&s;tory of magic from its origin and invention, and taken &s;ome notice of tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages in holy writ, where &s;orcerers and magici|ans are made mention of, I &s;hall now proceed to a more intere&s;ting part of my &s;ubject, in which I &s;hall lay open the arcana of the art magic, and &s;hew what that wicked and my&s;terious compact is, on which it depends, and explain the nature of tho&s;e diabolical engagements, which a man mu&s;t enter into before he can become an adept in &s;orcery.</P>
<P>This compact or agreement, as grave and learned authors inform us, is &s;ometimes made expre&s;sly with the great devil him&s;elf in per&s;on, corporally pre&s;ent before witne&s;&s;es, who takes an oath of homage and allegiance from his va&s;&s;al, and then endows him with the powers of magic: This was the ca&s;e with a certain Arragone&s;e nobleman, which Hei&s;terback in his treati&s;e upon miracles tells us he was a witne&s;s to, al&s;o of the Vidame Theophylus in the year 537, as related by Sigi&s;bert: Sometimes it is done by memorial or addre&s;s in writing, in the manner of certain Norman heretics, who wrote a petition to the Sybills, as chief of the necromancers: This pe|tition &s;ets forth that,
<Q>WHEREAS the parties under&s;igning had entered into certain articles
<PB N="43" REF="48">
and conditions and by &s;olemn engagement bound them&s;elves faithfully to perform the &s;ame, they now pray in the fir&s;t place the rati|fication of tho&s;e articles and conditions on the part of the Sybills; and that they would be plea&s;ed in conformity thereunto to order and direct their under-agents and familiars to do &s;uit and &s;ervice to the contracting parties agreeably to condition; and that when they were &s;ummoned and invoked to appear, they would be promptly forth-coming, not in their own &s;hapes, to the annoyance and offence of the contracting parties, but &s;prucely and hand|&s;omely, like per&s;onable gentlemen; al&s;o that the petitioners might be di&s;charged from the ceremony of compelling them by the drawing of a circle, or of confining them&s;elves or their familiars within the &s;ame.<P>Secondly, That the Sybills would be plea&s;ed to affix &s;ome &s;eal or &s;ignature to the conven|tion, by which its power and efficacy with their &s;ub&s;ervient familiars might be rendered more &s;ecure and permanent.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the petitioners may be ex|empted from all danger, which might other|wi&s;e accrue to them, from the civil authority of magi&s;trates or the inqui&s;itorial power of the church.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="49">
Fourthly, that all the temporal underta|kings and pur&s;uits of the petitioners in the courts and councils of princes may pro&s;per and &s;ucceed; and that good luck may attend them in all kinds of gaming to their &s;uitable profit and advantage.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, That their enemies of all &s;orts may have no power over them to do them hurt.</P>
<P>That the&s;e conditions being granted and performed, the petitioners on their part &s;olemn|ly promi&s;e and vow perpetual fealty and alle|giance to their &s;overeigns, the Sybills, as in the convention it&s;elf is more fully &s;et forth; and that they will faithfully, and &s;o long as they &s;hall live, make a &s;acrifice and oblation of one human &s;oul, every year to be offered up on the day and hour of the day, in which this con|vention &s;hall be ratified and confirmed by the Sybilline powers; Provided always, That the &s;aid high and mighty powers &s;hall fully and <HI>bona fide</HI> perform what is therein &s;tipulated and agreed to on their parts in the premi&s;|es.</P></Q></P>
<P>This document is faithfully tran&s;lated from Father Delrius's Latin treati&s;e <HI>Di&s;qui&s;itionum Magicarum, Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 4: He &s;ays that it was publicly burned at Paris together with the books of magic it refers to, and he quotes the
<PB N="45" REF="50">
authority of <HI>Cre&s;petus de odio Satanae Di&s;cur&s;u</HI> 15. for a more particular account; but as Cre&s;petus's book is not in my reach I can trace the &s;tory no further.</P>
<P>In both the&s;e ca&s;es, whether the parties con|tract <HI>viva voce,</HI> or proceed by petition, the con|ditions are the &s;ame and con&s;i&s;t, as we are told, in an expre&s;s renunciation of the Chri&s;tian creed; the bapti&s;mal rites are rever&s;ed, and the devil, or his repre&s;entative, &s;cratches out the cro&s;s from the forehead with his nails, and re-baptizes his va&s;&s;al by a name of his own devi&s;ing; the&s;e are indi&s;pen&s;able conditions: The devil al&s;o ex|acts &s;ome rag or remnant of his va&s;&s;al's gar|ment, as a badge of allegiance, and compels him to make the oath within a circle drawn upon the ground, (which being a figure without begin|ning or end is a &s;ymbol of divinity) in this circle the figure of a cro&s;s is to be traced out, on which the magician elect tramples and kicks with di&s;|dain; he then reque&s;ts the devil to &s;trike his name out of the book of life, and in&s;cribe it in the book of death; he next promi&s;es to make monthly or quarterly &s;acrifices to the devil, which female magicians or witches perform by &s;ucking out the breath of a new-born male infant; he proceeds to put &s;ome &s;ecret mark upon him&s;elf with the point of a needle, as the &s;ign of the
<PB N="46" REF="51">
Bea&s;t or Antichri&s;t, in which mark there is great potency, and in &s;ome ca&s;es, according to Irenaeus, it appears that the devil in&s;i&s;ts upon cauterizing his di&s;ciples in the upper membrane of the right ear; in others, according to Ter|tullian, in the forehead; this being done the magician elect vows eternal enmity again&s;t the Euchari&s;t, the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, the Saints, the Holy Relics and Images, and for&s;wears confe&s;|&s;ion for ever; upon which the devil ratifies his part of the compact, and the magic ceremony is complete.</P>
<P>On the&s;e conditions the devil &s;eldom, if ever, takes a terrific form, for fear of deterring his votaries, and oftentimes appears in great beau|ty and with a very winning addre&s;s, as he did to Theodore Maillot, deputy governor of Lorraine, vi&s;iting him in the &s;hape of a very pretty girl, <HI>(lepid&acirc; et liberali form&acirc; puella)</HI> and promi&s;ing him a certain great lady in marriage, with whom Maillot was di&s;tractedly in love; the conditions &s;tipulated by the devil on this vi&s;it were of a piece with the lovely form he a&s;&s;umed, for they con&s;i&s;ted in injunctions only to perform all the Chri&s;tian and moral duties, to ob&s;erve his meagre days, to &s;ay his ma&s;&s;es, and be regular in his confe&s;&s;ions: The&s;e unexpected &s;tipulations threw Maillot into &s;o deep a melancholy, that his do|me&s;tic
<PB N="47" REF="52">
chaplain, ob&s;erving it, extorted from him a confe&s;&s;ion of all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and piou&s;ly di&s;&s;uaded him from any further interviews of that &s;ort: Remigius, who relates the &s;tory in his Daemonolatria, gravely ob&s;erves the judg|ment of heaven &s;oon overtook him in a very ex|traordinary manner, for his hor&s;e fell down upon &s;mooth ground, and Maillot broke his neck by the fall.</P>
<P>As to the magic powers, which the devil im|parts in return for the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions of his vota|ries, theologicians have different opinions, &s;ome giving more and &s;ome le&s;s credit to the miracle; but the general opinion among&s;t them is that they are performed by the devil and his daemons by the celerity of art and motion with which one thing is &s;ub&s;tituted for another, but that there is no new creation in the ca&s;e. They do not doubt but that there are certain figures, names and characters, which have a magical power, as the nine cauldrons, the names of the four principal hinges of the world, the three|times-&s;even characters of Mahometan device and many others; that there are rings and &s;eals, which are amulets and charms, in&s;cribed with the names of Raphael, Salomon, Zachariah, Eli|zeus, Con&s;tantine, The Maccabees and others; that certain &s;igns in the Zodiac engraved upon
<PB N="48" REF="53">
gems have good or evil properties, for in&s;tance, Aries, Leo and Sagittarius make a man be|loved; Virgo, Taurus and Capricornus make him religious; Gemini, Libra and Aquarius produce friend&s;hip; whil&s;t Cancer, Scorpio and Pi&s;ces create fal&s;ehood: The character of Sa|turn gives &s;trength; Jupiter good fortune; Mars victory; Sol riches; Venus prevents drowning, and Luna has the &s;ame virtue with Venus: The figure of an a&s;s, engraved on a chry&s;olite, im|parts the gift of prophecy; that of a dragon gives riches, and that of a frog gives friend&s;hip: It was the prevailing opinion in Flanders that a man born on Ea&s;ter-eve had the gift of curing fevers; &s;o had the &s;eventh &s;on, where no daugh|ter interpo&s;ed; whereas the gift, which the kings of England had of touching for the evil, expired upon the here&s;y of Henry the eighth, though William Tooker wrote books to prove that Queen Elizabeth, then on the throne, inherited this virtue with the crown; this doctrine of Tooker is &s;trenuou&s;ly controverted by Delrius the Je&s;uit of Salamanca, and his argument is very logical and deci&s;ive: <HI>Miracula propria &s;unt eccle&s;iae Catholicae; &s;ed Elizabetha e&s;t extra eccle|&s;iam Catholicam, et nulli dantur qui &s;it extra eccle|&s;iam Catholicam; ergo Elizabethae non dantur mi|racula.</HI> Q.

<P>Though heretics have ob&s;tinately denied the copulation of wizards with the female daemons called Succubae; and of witches with the males, or Incubi, yet the whole authority of the Catho|lic church with the bull of Pope Innocent VIII. expre&s;sly affirms it for a fact&mdash;<HI>(Communis tamen haec e&s;t &s;ententia Patrum, Theologorum et Philo|&s;ophorum doctorum&mdash;et pro e&acirc;dem pugrat bulla In|nocentii</HI> VIII. <HI>Pontificis contra maleficos).</HI>&mdash;It is al&s;o an orthodox opinion, that children may be begotten by this diabolical commerce, and

<P>I &s;hould be loth to have it &s;uppo&s;ed that I have &s;elected the&s;e anecdotes and quotations for the purpo&s;e merely of ca&s;ting a ridicule on the &s;uper&s;tition of the Catholic church; I can truly declare I did not take up the &s;ubject with any &s;uch de&s;ign, and hold the principle of religious animo&s;ity in as much abhorrence as any man living. When I have &s;aid this in my own de|fence, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to add, that all the ac|counts I have turned over, which are pretty vo|luminous, are replete with the &s;ame or greater ab&s;urdities, than the&s;e I have produced; all the rea&s;oning is nothing but a ma&s;s of ignorance,

refined upon by &s;ubtlety, in&s;pired by &s;uper&s;tition, and edged with acrimony again&s;t &s;chi&s;matics and heretics, upon whom this terrible engine of &s;or|cery has been turned with a &s;pirit of per&s;ecution, that does no credit to the parties who employed it.</P>
<P>The fact is that the Chri&s;tian church in the early ages &s;oon di&s;covered two important mat|ters of faith in the &s;acred writings, which might be made u&s;eful weapons in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; I mean miracles and &s;orceries; the one &s;he re&s;erved to her&s;elf, the other &s;he be&s;towed upon her ene|mies; and though there is every rea&s;on to con|clude that both had cea&s;ed in the world, &s;he found her own intere&s;t was concerned in pro|longing their exi&s;tence: The ages that &s;ucceed|ed to the introduction of Chri&s;tianity were &s;oon ca&s;t into the profounde&s;t ignorance by the irrup|tions of the barbarous nations, and credulity na|turally follows ignorance: the terrors of magic in tho&s;e dark times readily took hold of &s;uper&s;ti|tious minds; every thing that the dawnings of &s;cience &s;truck out in that night of rea&s;on, every thing that reviving art invented, even the little juggling tricks and deceptions, that &s;light of hand performed to &s;et the crowd agape and &s;upport a vagrant life in idlene&s;s, were charged to &s;orcery, and tortures were employed to force out con|fe&s;&s;ions
<PB N="53" REF="58">
of &s;ecret dealings and compacts with the devil and his agents. Tho&s;e confe&s;&s;ions were undoubtedly made, and as full and circum&s;tantial as the inqui&s;itor cho&s;e to pre&s;cribe, and being publi&s;hed with the authority of office had their influence with mankind and were believed; nay, it is but fair to &s;uppo&s;e that the fathers and doc|tors of the church them&s;elves believed them, and were &s;incere in their endeavours to extirpate &s;orcery, thinking that they did God &s;ervice.</P>
<P>When we read of people being thrown alive into the flames for playing a few juggling tricks, which now would not pa&s;s upon the vulgar at a country fair, and the devil him&s;elf brought in to father the performance, it is &s;hocking to huma|nity and a violence to rea&s;on; but we &s;hall cru|elly err again&s;t both by a&s;cribing all the&s;e acts to per&s;ecution, when ignorance and credulity are entitled to &s;o great a &s;hare of them: The churchmen of tho&s;e ages were not exempt from the errors and darkne&s;s of the time they lived in, and very many of them not only believed the &s;orceries of the heretics, but &s;wallowed the mi|racles of the &s;aints: The genius of the Catholic religion in this illuminated and liberal period is of a different complexion from what the nature of my &s;ubject has obliged me to di&s;play; of the enlarged and truly Chri&s;tian principles, which now
<PB N="54" REF="59">
prevail among&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of that &s;y&s;tem of faith, the world abounds with examples, and I am per&s;uaded, that if the tribunal of the Inqui&s;i|tion was put a&s;ide, (a tribunal &s;o directly adver&s;e to the religion of Chri&s;t) the hateful tenet of in|tolerancy would &s;oon be done away, and a &s;pirit of meekne&s;s and mercy, more con&s;entaneous to the principles of the pre&s;ent Catholics, would univer&s;ally prevail.</P>

<P>BY revi&s;ing what hi&s;tory has delivered of the fir&s;t poets of Greece we &s;hall be able to form a very tolerable conjecture of the authors, who&s;e works Pi&s;i&s;tratus collected at the time he in&s;tituted his library in Athens; but before I undertake this, it is proper to remark that &s;ome authorities, ancient as well as modern, have a&s;cribed the honour of compiling Homer's rhap|&s;odies to Hipparchus the &s;on of Pi&s;i&s;tratus, and not to Pi&s;i&s;tratus him&s;elf: I am not willing therefore to pa&s;s over the que&s;tion without &s;ome explanation of it.</P>
<P>The ancient authorities I allude to are tho&s;e of Plato in his Hipparchus, and Aelian in the
<PB N="55" REF="60">
&s;econd article of his eighth book: The fir&s;t is a naked a&s;&s;ertion; the &s;econd &s;ets forth more cir|cum&s;tantially&mdash;<HI>That Hipparchus the &s;on of Pi&s;i|&s;tratus was the fir&s;t, who brought Homer's poems to Athens and made the rhap&s;odi&s;ts rehear&s;e them in the general a&s;&s;embly of the Grecian &s;tates</HI>&mdash;But this author, who is generally a faithful though a minute collector of anecdotes, expre&s;sly contra|dicts him&s;elf in the fourteenth article of the thir|teenth book, and tells us that Pi&s;i&s;tratus com|piled the Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey of Homer: Cicero in the quotation from his Orator mentioned in a preceding paper gives the credit of the work to Pi&s;i&s;tratus; Suidas under the article of Homer &s;ays&mdash;<HI>That various per&s;ons were at the pains of collecting and arranging the&s;e books in &s;ucceeding times, but of the&s;e Pi&s;i&s;tratus of Athens was the fir&s;t.</HI>&mdash;Eu&s;tathius in his commentary on the Iliad concurs in the &s;ame te&s;timony; he &s;ays&mdash;<HI>That the grammarians who compiled the Iliad, did it, as it is &s;aid, by command of Pi&s;i&s;tratus; that they cor|rected it at di&s;cretion, and that the principal of the&s;e was Ari&s;tarchus, and next to him Zenodotus.</HI> (<HI>Comm. ad Iliad, lib.</HI> 1.) In this latter particular the learned commentator has fallen into an er|ror; for it is well known that the celebrated critic Ari&s;tarchus, as well as Zenodotus, lived many years after the time of Pi&s;i&s;tratus: I &s;hall
<PB N="56" REF="61">
mention only one authority more on the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion, which I take to be more deci&s;ive than any of the foregoing, and this is an ancient epigrammati&s;t, who in a di&s;tich upon a &s;tatue of Pi&s;i&s;tratus celebrates him on this very account, and gives a very probable conjecture, that this &s;tatue was erected in commemoration of the great work of the above-mentioned com|pilation. (<HI>Anthol. lib.</HI> iv. <HI>cap.</HI> iv.)</P>
<P>From the&s;e authorities, as well as from &s;trength of circum&s;tance, it &s;eems highly probable that the founder of the fir&s;t public library &s;hould be &s;tu|dious to enrich his collection with the poems of the Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey.</P>
<P>This important work was both extremely dif|ficult to execute, and attended with very con|&s;iderable expence in the progre&s;s of it. The rhap&s;odies of Homer were &s;cattered up and down among&s;t the cities of Greece, which the itine|rant poet had vi&s;ited, and were nece&s;&s;arily in a very mutilated &s;tate or recorded in men's me|mories after an imperfect manner and by piece|meal only: In &s;ome places the&s;e ine&s;timable re|liques had been con&s;umed by fire; and in the lap&s;e of time it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e they had &s;uffered many injuries by accident, and not a few by interpolation. Solon him&s;elf is accu&s;ed of having made in&s;ertions in favour of the Atheni|ans
<PB N="57" REF="62">
for political purpo&s;es. Nothing but the mo&s;t timely exertions could have re&s;cued them from oblivion, and Pi&s;i&s;tratus by re&s;toring Homer has ju&s;tly made his own name the companion of the poet's in immortality: To his ardour we are indebted for their pre&s;ent exi&s;tence. Under|&s;tanding that there were rhap&s;odi&s;ts, who went about the &s;everal Grecian &s;tates reciting, &s;ome an hundred, &s;ome a thou&s;and lines in detached pa&s;&s;ages of the Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey, he cau&s;ed pub|lic proclamation to be made of his de&s;ign to collect tho&s;e famous poems, offering a reward to every man, who &s;hould bring him any fragment to a&s;&s;i&s;t his intended compilation, and appointing proper per&s;ons to receive their re&s;pective contributions. The re&s;ort on this occa&s;ion &s;oon became prodi|gious; Pi&s;i&s;tratus however, &s;till intent upon the work, adhered to his conditions, and let no man go away without his reward, though the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ages had been furni&s;hed ever &s;o often by others before him: The in&s;pectors of the work by the&s;e means had an opportunity of collating one with the other, and rejecting what appeared &s;purious upon collation: This was an office of great delicacy, and the able&s;t men of the time were &s;elected for that purpo&s;e, with liberal allow|ances for their trouble; they were many in number, and when each had made his &s;eparate
<PB N="58" REF="63">
collection, and the rhap&s;odi&s;ts cea&s;ed to come in, Pi&s;i&s;tratus cau&s;ed them all to a&s;&s;emble and pro|duce their &s;everal copies for general review: The whole was now arranged according to the natural order of the poems, and in that order &s;ubmitted to the final &s;upervi&s;ion of two per&s;ons, who were judged mo&s;t competent: The poem, thus compiled and corrected according to their judgment and di&s;cretion, was fairly tran&s;cribed and the copy with great &s;olemnity depo&s;ited in the library: Had the like care been extended to the <HI>Margites</HI> and the re&s;t of Homer's poems, the world would probably have now been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them al&s;o; and it is fair to conclude from the circum&s;tance of their extinction, that both the Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey would have &s;hared the &s;ame fate, had not this event &s;o happily taken place under the patronage of Pi&s;i&s;tratus. Let us mark this aera therefore as the mo&s;t important in the annals of literature, and let every man, who admires the genius of Homer, revere the memory of Pi&s;i&s;tratus.</P>
<P>Lycurgus we know brought Homer's poems out of A&s;ia, and di&s;per&s;ed them among&s;t his countrymen at Lacedaemon; but Lycurgus con|&s;idered the&s;e poems as a collection of maxims moral and political; he knew the influence, which poetry has over rude uncivilized tempers,
<PB N="59" REF="64">
and the &s;ame rea&s;ons, that engaged him to em|ploy the &s;ongs of Thales the Cretan in his fir&s;t preludes towards a con&s;titution of government, led him to adopt and import the epic poems of the Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey: He &s;aw they were of a &s;ublime and animating ca&s;t, in&s;piring principles of religion, love of our country, contempt of death and every heroic virtue, that can dignify man's nature; that they manife&s;ted to Greece what misfortunes attended the di&s;union of her powers, and what tho&s;e powers were capable of performing, when united; he wi&s;hed to &s;ee an indi&s;&s;oluble alliance and compact of all the &s;tates of Greece for their common glory and defence, but he wi&s;hed to &s;ee the &s;tate of Sparta, like the &s;ons of Atreus, at the head of the league: In all the&s;e particulars the poems of Homer fully met his wi&s;hes and fell in with his views, and as he had made his ob&s;ervations on the manners and characters of the A&s;iatics during his travels among&s;t them, he per&s;uaded him&s;elf the time might come, when the united arms of Greece would again prevail over the nations of the Ea&s;t, e&s;pecially when the natural bravery of the Greeks was &s;timulated by an heroic poem &s;o flattering to their country and &s;o encouraging to their hopes.</P>
<P>Pi&s;i&s;tratus on the other hand was actuated by
<PB N="60" REF="65">
no &s;uch public principles; but, though he had not a patriotic, yet he had an elegant mind, and the &s;ame love of learning, which had dictated the thought of erecting a public repo&s;itory for &s;uch works of genius as were worthy to be pre|&s;erved, in&s;pired him with the ambition of being the editor of Homer's &s;cattered remains: This never once occurred to the Spartan legi&s;lator, who valued them not as poems, but as precepts, in which light they were no le&s;s beneficial in their &s;eparated &s;tate than when complete.</P>
<P>The Athenian tyrant contemplated them with the eye of a critic, and perceiving they would make the &s;ublime&s;t and mo&s;t perfect compilation the world had ever &s;een, he u&s;hered them into it with all the pa&s;&s;ion of an enthu&s;ia&s;t: As he evi|dently perceived they inculcated no doctrines inimical to monarchy, on the contrary that they recommended acquie&s;cence under rule and obe|dience to di&s;cipline, he obliged the rhap&s;odi&s;ts to rehear&s;e them publicly in the ears of Greece at the great fe&s;tival of the Panathenaea.</P>
<P>The publication of Homer's poems in this &s;tate of perfection was the cau&s;e that produced &s;uch a flow of compo&s;itions, e&s;pecially in the dramatic line; for, as I before ob&s;erved, it ope|rated to the di&s;couragement of epic writing, and few in&s;tances of any poems under that de&s;crip|tion
<PB N="61" REF="66">
occur after the compilation of the Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey: Men of genius are not ea&s;ily di&s;po&s;ed to imitate what they de&s;pair of equalling, and the contemplation of a perfect work in any branch of compo&s;ition will of cour&s;e deter other adventurers from inferior attempts.</P>
<P>The drama was now in its dawn and had made &s;ome advances before the compilation of the Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey, but it received &s;uch im|provement from tho&s;e poems, that it is generally a&s;&s;erted, and by Ari&s;totle among&s;t others, to have derived its origin from Homer; in the further progre&s;s of the&s;e papers I &s;hall fully examine how that que&s;tion &s;tands, for the pre&s;ent it will be my purpo&s;e to take a review of the &s;tate of literature in Greece at this remarkable period, when Pi&s;i&s;tratus founded his library in Athens; a di&s;qui&s;ition, which, although it will carry us into times of very remote antiquity and of doubt|ful hi&s;tory, will I hope prove not devoid of entertainment even to &s;uch of my readers, as have not habituated them&s;elves to &s;tudies of this nature.</P>
<P>It is for the &s;ake of &s;uch, and in ju&s;tice to the opinion I would wi&s;h to impre&s;s of the amiable character of Pi&s;i&s;tratus, that I &s;ubjoin to this paper &s;ome explanation of the term <HI>Tyrant,</HI> by which in conformity to hi&s;tory I have been
<PB N="62" REF="67">
obliged to denominate him: The word accord|ing to our con&s;truction of it conveys the mo&s;t odious idea, but when it was applied to Pi&s;i|&s;tratus it was a title of royalty and not a term of reproach: In the age of Homer, He&s;iod and the Greek poets of that date the word was not in u&s;e; they u&s;ed no term but <HI>Ba&s;ileus,</HI> which they applied even to the cruele&s;t of de&s;pots, as the learned reader may be convinced of, if he will con&s;ult the Ody&s;&s;ey, (<HI>Rhap. E.</HI> 84.) This is a point of critici&s;m &s;o well agreed upon by all philologi&s;ts, that the Hymn to Mars, which &s;ome have attributed to Homer, is by internal evidence now fully convicted of being po&s;terior to him, becau&s;e the term <HI>Tyrannus</HI> is found in it. The word is &s;aid to be derived from the Tyrrhenians and to have come into u&s;e about the age of Archilochus, who flouri&s;hed in the eighteenth Olympiad, many years &s;ub&s;equent to Homer and prior to Pi&s;i&s;tratus, at which time, (viz. the age of Archilochus) Gyges, Tyrant of Lydia, was the fir&s;t &s;o intitled: For this we have the authority of Euphorion, a writer born in the cxxvi Olympiad, and librarian to Anti|ochus the Great, king of Syria; al&s;o of Clemens the hi&s;torian, (<HI>Strom.</HI> 1.)</P>

<P>I NOW propo&s;e to review the &s;tate of litera|ture in Greece antecedent to the time when Pi&s;i&s;tratus founded his library in Athens.</P>
<P>Letters, or the alphabet, were probably im|ported into Greece from Phoenicia: This is a&s;cribed to the poet <HI>Linus</HI>; this poet, according to the fabulous ta&s;te of the times, was of divine origin, being reputed the &s;on of Apollo by Terp&s;ichore, according to other accounts of either Mercury, or Amphimarus, by Urania: If in a pedigree &s;o doubtful we may chu&s;e for our&s;elves, Mercury, as inventor of the lyre, &s;eems to have a preferable claim to Amphimarus or Apollo, for Linus is &s;aid to have been the father of lyric poetry; he is al&s;o recorded as the in&s;tructor of Hercules in letters, but if the elder Orpheus was al&s;o his di&s;ciple, he mu&s;t have been of too early an age to have been contemporary with Hercules, for Orpheus is placed eleven ages before the &s;iege of Troy. Hercules may have been in&s;tructed by the Theban Linus, who was con&s;iderably junior to this of Chalcedon; Linus of Thebes was the &s;on of the poet Eu|molpus, and imparted to Greece the knowledge of the globes; he al&s;o before the time of He&s;iod
<PB N="64" REF="69">
compo&s;ed a poem, in which he gives the gene|alogy of the deities; all we know re&s;pecting it is that it differs in &s;ome particulars from He&s;iod's Theogony: He paid dearly for the honour of being Hercules's preceptor, for that deified hero put Linus to death; though he gave the genealogy of the heathen gods, he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have taught a &s;ublimer doctrine of the Unity of the Supreme Being.</P>
<P>Of the name of <HI>Orpheus</HI> grammarians reckon no fewer than five epic poets; their hi&s;tories are involved in fable, and their di&s;tinctions uncertain and ob&s;cure. The Thracian Orpheus, who is the elder of the name, is &s;aid to have been the di&s;ciple of Linus and to have lived before the Trojan war eleven ages: He was a prophet as well as a poet, and in&s;tituted many ceremonies in the Pagan theology; he delivered precepts in ver&s;e relative to the modes of initiation: The my&s;terious rites of Ceres and Bacchus are &s;up|po&s;ed to have originated with him, but as it is pretty clear that the&s;e rites were Egyptian, they might be introduced, but not invented, by Or|pheus.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Orpheus was &s;irnamed Ciconaeus or Arcas, and was al&s;o of Thracian extraction; he is &s;aid to have flouri&s;hed two generations be|fore the &s;iege of Troy; he al&s;o was an heroic
<PB N="65" REF="70">
poet and wrote fables and hymns addre&s;&s;ed to the deities. Orpheus Odry&s;ius and Orpheus Camarinaeus were epic poets, but he, who was &s;irnamed Crotoniates, was contemporary with Pi&s;i&s;tratus and lived in great favour and famili|arity at the Athenian court; he is &s;aid to have written the Argonautics, the hymns and the poems <HI>de Lapidibus</HI> now in our hands.</P>
<P>The antients, in the true &s;pirit of fable, a&s;cribed miraculous powers to the harmony of Orpheus's lyre, and almo&s;t all the Roman poets have echoed his prai&s;es in the &s;ame fanciful &s;train.

<P>Of the name of <HI>Mu&s;aeus</HI> there were al&s;o &s;eve|ral poets; the elder, or Athenian Mu&s;aeus, &s;on of Antiphemus, was the &s;cholar of Orpheus. The poetry of the&s;e antient bards was chiefly addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;ervices of religion; their hymns were chaunted as parts of divine wor&s;hip, and the power of divination was a&s;cribed to them, as the natural tribute of a barbarous multitude to men of &s;uperior and enlightened talents: The knowledge of &s;imples and their u&s;e in healing di&s;ea&s;es or wounds was among&s;t the arts, by which the&s;e early benefactors to mankind at|tracted the reverence of the vulgar, and Mu&s;aeus is &s;aid to have compo&s;ed a poem on the cure of di&s;ea&s;es: This Mu&s;aeus was the father of Eu|molpus, and it will be found by them, who have curio&s;ity to &s;earch into the records of the&s;e an|tient bards, that the great prerogatives of pro|phet and poet de&s;cended regularly through cer|tain families after the manner of the Ea&s;tern and Jewi&s;h ca&s;ts. <HI>Eumolpus,</HI> who was of this family, be&s;ides the hymns and ver&s;es he compo&s;ed upon the my&s;teries of Ceres and Bacchus, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the art of divination by in&s;pection of the human palm; an art of Egyptian origin.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="72"><HI>Thamyris,</HI> the &s;on of Philammon, is reckoned among&s;t the epic poets, who flouri&s;hed before the time of Homer: He compo&s;ed a long poem, con&s;i&s;ting of nearly three thou&s;and lines, intitled The Theology; but as this could not be deno|minated an epic poem, and as no record remains of any compo&s;ition of his in that branch of po|etry, it is a great doubt whether it is not owing to the fictions of the early grammarians, who were indu&s;trious to detract from the originality of Homer's epic, that Thamyris and &s;o many others are enumerated under that de&s;cription of poets antecedent to Homer; for &s;ome accounts make Thamyris the eighth epic poet prior to Homer, an authority to which no credit &s;eems due.</P>
<P><HI>Mar&s;yas</HI> and <HI>Olympus</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to have lived in the time of the Argonautic expedition, but they, as well as <HI>Amphion,</HI> are more cele|brated for their mu&s;ical talents and inventions, than for their &s;kill in poetry: Of <HI>Demodocus, Phemius</HI> and <HI>A&s;bolus</HI> the Centaur, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been poets antecedent to Homer, I find no particulars.</P>
<P>The exact time, in which <HI>He&s;iod</HI> lived, as re|ferring to the age of Homer, remains a point of controver&s;y in the chronology of the poets: They, who give credit to the ver&s;es he is by

&s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed to have written in competition with Homer, mu&s;t place him as his contempo|rary; the be&s;t authorities fix him in a period &s;omewhat antecedent to Homer's; Aulus Gel|lius inclines to the opinion of He&s;iod being po&s;|terior to Homer, but Ari&s;tophanes in his comedy of The Frogs places Homer in order of time after He&s;iod: He introduces the poet Ae&s;chylus reciting the prai&s;es of Orpheus in the fir&s;t place, &s;econdly of Mu&s;aeus, thirdly of He&s;iod, and la&s;tly of Homer, which order of placing them the old &s;cholia&s;t interprets to apply to the times, in which they lived; the pa&s;&s;age is as follows:

<P>The bards of the Orphean family and others of high antiquity employed their talents in com|po&s;ing hymns and offices of devotion; and it is natural that &s;uch &s;hould be the fir&s;t u&s;e and ap|plication
<PB N="69" REF="74">
of the powers of poetry; the rea&s;on is good on both &s;ides why there &s;hould in all times have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted an alliance between poetry and prayer. Metre aids and is adapted to the me|mory; it accords to mu&s;ic and is the vehicle of enthu&s;ia&s;m; it makes the moral doctrines of re|ligion more &s;ublime, and the my&s;terious ones more profound; it can render truth more awful and &s;uper&s;tition more impo&s;ing: If the ea&s;tern nations have &s;et apart a language for their prie&s;ts and dedicated it as &s;acred to the purpo&s;es of prayer, we may well believe that the antient heathen bards, who were chiefly A&s;iatic Greeks, performed religious rites and ceremonies in me|tre, with accompaniments of mu&s;ic, to which they were devoted in the extreme: The hymns of David and the patriarchal prophecies were in metre, and &s;peak for them&s;elves; we have the &s;ame authority for knowing that the Chaldean wor&s;hip was accompanied with mu&s;ic; the fact does not need illu&s;tration; the divinations of Mu&s;aeus and the hymns of Orpheus were of the &s;ame character; initiations were performed, ora|cles were delivered and even laws promulgated in ver&s;e: The influence of poetry over the hu|man heart is coeval with it, not limited by time or country, but univer&s;al to the world in all its parts and all its periods; it is the language of
<PB N="70" REF="75">
rapture, &s;prings with invention and flows with devotion; the enthu&s;ia&s;t in love or glory breaks forth into it &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and the voice of la|mentation, attuned by &s;en&s;ibility, falls naturally into numbers.</P>
<P>When I am &s;peaking of the Oracular Poets, or Diviners, it is not po&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s over the <HI>Sybills,</HI> the mo&s;t extraordinary in this order of bards; their oracles have been agitated by the learned in all ages, and received with the utmo&s;t veneration and re&s;pect by the Greeks fir&s;t, and afterwards by the Romans: Heathen writers and &s;ome of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectable fathers of the Chri&s;tian Church refer to them without he|&s;itation, and the fact of their exi&s;tence re&s;ts upon &s;uch &s;trength of te&s;timony, as &s;eems to amount to hi&s;torical demon&s;tration and univer&s;al a&s;&s;ent. It appears that the Delphic and Erythrean Sybills, who were the olde&s;t of the name, lived before the Trojan war: The ver&s;es of the Erythrean Sybill, foretelling the coming of Chri&s;t, are &s;eri|ou&s;ly referred to by Eu&s;ebius and St. Au&s;tin; they are thirty-three in number, and now in our hands. She, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have offered the nine volumes of oracles to Tarquinius Pri&s;|cus at Rome, was the Cumaean; the Chaldaean, Per&s;ic or Hebrew Sybill prophe&s;ied of Alexan|der of Macedon; the Helle&s;pontic was coeval
<PB N="71" REF="76">
with Solon; the Samian and others lived in later periods.</P>
<P>Of the Capitoline Oracles there is ample room to doubt; &s;uch a political engine in the hands of the prie&s;ts and to a certain degree under the direction of the Patrician order, offer|ed opportunities for abu&s;e too tempting to be with&s;tood in a con&s;titution &s;o &s;ubject to popular commotions; it is true they were &s;paringly ap|plied to, and never brought out but in pre&s;&s;ing exigencies, yet tho&s;e exigencies and the blind idolatry of the people encouraged the abu&s;e by its practicability as well as by its expedience. There is a pa&s;&s;age in Cicero's private letters, which makes confe&s;&s;ion to this very point. The original oracles were de&s;troyed by fire together with the Capitol it&s;elf, in which they were de|po&s;ited; the &s;ub&s;titutes, which were collected in Greece and many other parts of the world to re|place them, were finally burned by Stilicho in the reign of the emperor Honorius.</P>
<P>The lines, which have come down to us un|der the character of Sybilline Oracles, mu&s;t be cautiou&s;ly admitted; their authenticity is dubi|ous in mo&s;t parts, evidently fictitious in many, but &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages have by great authorities been con&s;idered as genuine: The great critic Bentley, &s;peaking of them generally in his di&s;&s;ertations
<PB N="72" REF="77">
on Phalaris, calls the Sybilline Oracles now extant <HI>clum&s;y cheats:</HI> The learned profe&s;&s;or Whi&s;ton has inve&s;tigated them with much indu&s;try and &s;ome addre&s;s; he &s;eparates certain parts, which he believes to be genuine, and his argument merits &s;erious con&s;ideration: I am aware that this author mu&s;t be heard with re&s;erve in matters of prediction, fora&s;much as he lived long enough to &s;ee two completions of his own Milennium: He traces the interpolated pa&s;&s;ages however with con&s;iderable &s;agacity and imputes them with good appearance of rea&s;on to the heretical &s;ectaries of the fourth century; tho&s;e, which he adopts as genuine, he tran&s;lates into literal pro&s;e, and they are curious records. External te&s;timonies make &s;trongly in favour of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, and it is re|markable that the &s;agacity of critics have urged no internal characters in evidence again&s;t them. The elder Sybill has predictions of Homer and the Trojan war; their &s;tile much re&s;embles that of Homer him&s;elf, and antient writers do not &s;cruple to &s;ay that Homer borrowed &s;everal of the&s;e Sybilline lines and in&s;erted them in his po|em, as the Sybill her&s;elf foretells he would do in the following words, viz.&mdash;<HI>Then an old lying writer &s;hall appear in that time again, counter|feiting his country, being al&s;o dim-&s;ighted: He &s;hall have much wit and eloquence, and &s;hall com|po&s;e</HI>

Or. lib.</HI> viii. <HI>v.</HI> 357 <HI>ad</HI> 368.)</P>
<P>This is among&s;t the pa&s;&s;ages which Mr. Whi&s;ton thinks genuine; it is curious at lea&s;t, and the reader mu&s;t &s;ub&s;cribe as much or little of his belief to it, as he thinks it de&s;erves; but of the actual exi&s;tence of the&s;e antient prophete&s;&s;es he will find &s;ufficient te&s;timony, and if he chu&s;es to clo&s;e with the tran&s;lator in his deductions, he will conclude that&mdash;<HI>Whil&s;t God &s;ent his Jewi&s;h prophets to the nation of the Jews from Mo&s;es to Malachi, he &s;eems al&s;o to have &s;ent all along the&s;e Gentile prophete&s;&s;es to the Gentiles, for their guid|ance and direction and caution in religious mat|ters.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall ob&s;erve in general, that the&s;e Sybilline oracles are illuminated and &s;upported by the fourth Eclogue of Virgil, which by the be&s;t opinions is decided not to allude to He&s;iod's poems, as &s;ome have interpreted it. The Sybill chaunted her oracles, &s;tanding on a &s;tone, in a wild manner and with the voice of one that was
<PB N="74" REF="79">
frantic: The&s;e oracles declare the de&s;olation of empires, and the various convul&s;ions of nature by earthquakes, inundations and volcanoes: Some revolutions are di&s;tinctly pointed out, other things are &s;hadowed di&s;tantly and in ob|&s;curity; but what is mo&s;t extraordinary upon the whole is, that certain events in times, that mu&s;t have been po&s;terior to the compo&s;ition of the&s;e ver&s;es, even admitting them to be &s;purious, &s;eem to fulfil the&s;e predictions in a very &s;ingular manner. The following pa&s;&s;age, relative to the conflagration, re&s;urrection and renovation of all things is &s;elected from the fourth book of ora|cles, which Mr. Whi&s;ton judges to be genuine; I give the tran&s;lation in his words, viz. <HI>If you will not be per&s;uaded by me, O men of an evil heart! but love unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and receive the&s;e advices with a perver&s;e mind, a fire &s;hall come into the world, and the&s;e &s;igns &s;hall appear in it, &s;words and the &s;ound of a trumpet, when the &s;un ri&s;es, and all the world &s;hall hear a bellowing and vehement noi&s;e, and the earth &s;hall burn; and after the fire hath de&s;troyed all mankind, and all cities and rivers and &s;eas &s;hall be &s;oot and a&s;hes, and God &s;hall extin|gui&s;h this immen&s;e fire, which he had kindled, out of tho&s;e bones and a&s;hes God &s;hall again form men; and when he hath made them as they were before, then &s;hall the judgment be; in which God &s;hall act ju&s;tly,</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="80">
<HI>judging the world again; and tho&s;e men, who have lived wickedly, the earth &s;hall cover them; but they who are righteous &s;hall live again on the earth, God giving the pious &s;pirit and life and &s;ufficient provi&s;ions; and then all men &s;hall &s;ee them&s;elves. Mo&s;t happy is that man! who &s;hall be in being at that time.</HI></P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion I think it a fair remark to be made upon the&s;e famous Sybilline ver&s;es, that the evidence there is of interpolations in &s;everal parts of them makes &s;trongly for the pre&s;ump|tion, that there did really exi&s;t certain antient and genuine ver&s;es, uttered by true or pretended prophete&s;&s;es, called Sybills, whereupon the&s;e &s;e|veral forgeries were grounded: The a&s;&s;ent of the learned, both Heathen and Chri&s;tian, cor|roborates this opinion; but whether the copy now in our hand does or does not contain any genuine lines of the&s;e Sybills, is a que&s;tion I will not now take on my&s;elf to di&s;cu&s;s; all that need be &s;aid on this point at pre&s;ent is, that there are &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, who&s;e antiquity is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the references and quotations of the old Hea|then writers, and again&s;t which no objections can be drawn from the internal characters and marks of the text.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t effu&s;ions of poetry having been addre&s;&s;ed to prayer and wor&s;hip, to the my&s;teries and genealogies of the deities, to reli|gious rites, &s;acrifices and initiations, and to the awful promulgation of oracles by enthu&s;ia&s;tic Sybills, chaunting forth to the a&s;toni&s;hed multi|tude their tremendous denunciations, the time was now in approach, when that portion of di|vine in&s;piration, which &s;eems to be the moving &s;pring of poetry, &s;hould branch into a new de|partment.</P>
<P>When the human genius was more matured and better qualified by judgment and experience, and the thoughts, in&s;tead of being hurried along by the furious impul&s;e of a heated fancy, began to take into &s;ober contemplation the worldly actions of men, and the revolutions and changes of human events, operating upon &s;ociety, the poet began to prepare him&s;elf by forethought and arrangement of ideas for the future purpo&s;es of compo&s;ition: It became his fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s to contrive a plan and ground-work for the &s;truc|ture of his poem; he &s;aw that it mu&s;t have uni|formity, &s;implicity and order, a beginning, a middle and an end; that the main object mu&s;t
<PB N="77" REF="82">
be intere&s;ting and important, that the incidents and acce&s;&s;ary parts mu&s;t hinge upon that object, and not wander from the central idea, on which the whole ought to re&s;t; that a &s;ubject corre|&s;ponding thereto, when elevated by language, &s;uperior to the phra&s;e and dialogue of the vulgar, would con&s;titute a work more orderly and bet|ter con&s;tructed, than what aro&s;e from the &s;udden and abrupt effu&s;ions of unpremeditated ver&s;e.</P>
<P>In this manner <HI>Homer,</HI> the great poet of anti|quity, and the father and founder, as I mu&s;t think, of epic poetry, revolving in his capacious mind the magnificent events of the Grecian a&s;|&s;ociation for the de&s;truction of Troy, then fre&s;h in the tradition, if not in the memories of his contemporaries, planned the great de&s;ign of his immortal Iliad. With this plan arranged and &s;ettled in his thoughts beforehand, he began to give a loo&s;e to the force and powers of his ima|gination in &s;trains and rhap&s;odies, which by fre|quent recitation fixed upon his memory, and, as he warmed with the advancing compo&s;ition, he &s;allied forth in &s;earch of hearers, chaunting his ver&s;es in the a&s;&s;emblies and cities, that re|ceived him; his fancy working out tho&s;e won|derful examples of the &s;ublime, as he took his &s;olitary migrations from place to place: When he made his pa&s;&s;ages by &s;ea, and committed
<PB N="78" REF="83">
him&s;elf to the terrors of the ocean, the grande&s;t &s;cenes in nature came under his view, and his pla&s;tic fancy, &s;eizing every object that accorded to its purpo&s;es, melted and compounded it into the ma&s;s and matter of the work, on which his brain was labouring: Thus with nature in his eye, in&s;piration at his heart and contemplation ever active, &s;ecured by &s;olitude again&s;t external interruption, and undi&s;turbed by worldly cares and concerns from within, the wandering bard performed what time has never equalled and what to all po&s;terity will remain the &s;tandard of perfection.&mdash;<HI>Hunc nemo in magnis &s;ublimitate, in parvis proprietate, &s;uperaverit: Idem latus ac pre&s;&s;us, jucundus et gravis, tum copia tum brevitate mirabilis; nec poetic&acirc; modo &s;ed oratori&acirc; virtute eminenti&s;&s;imus.</HI> (<HI>Quint. lib.</HI> x.)<Q REND="inline">"Him no one ever excelled in &s;ublimity on great topics, in propriety on &s;mall ones; whether diffu&s;ed or compre&s;&s;ed, gay or grave, whether for his abundance or his brevity, he is equally to be admired, nor is he &s;upereminent for poetical talents only but for oratorical al&s;o."</Q></P>
<P>There is no doubt but Homer compo&s;ed other poems be&s;ides his Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey: Ari&s;totle in his Poetics decidedly a&s;cribes The Margites to Homer; but as to the Ilias Minor and the Cypriacs, though it is evident the&s;e poems were
<PB N="79" REF="84">
in his hands, yet he &s;eems ignorant of their au|thor; the pa&s;&s;age I allude to will be found in the twenty-third chapter of his Poetics; he is com|paring the&s;e two poems with the Iliad and Ody&s;|&s;ey, as furni&s;hing &s;ubjects for the drama, and ob|&s;erves that the &s;tage could not properly draw above one or at mo&s;t two plots for tragedy from the Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey re&s;pectively, whereas many might be taken from the Cypriacs, and he enu|merates to the amount of ten, which might be found in the Ilias Minor: It is evident by the context, that he does not think either of the&s;e poems were compo&s;ed by Homer, and no le&s;s evident that he does not know to whom they are to be a&s;cribed; their high antiquity therefore is the only point, which this celebrated critic has put out of doubt.</P>
<P>The Ilias Minor appears to have been a poem, which includes the taking of Troy and the return of the Greeks: The incidents of the Aeneid, as far as they refer to the Trojan &s;tory, &s;eem to have been taken from this poem, and in particular the epi&s;ode of Sinon, which is among&s;t the dramatic &s;ubjects mentioned by Ari&s;totle: The controver&s;y between Ajax and Uly&s;&s;es for the armour of Achilles was copied by Ovid from the &s;ame poem. If this work is not to be given to Homer, we mu&s;t believe it was written &s;ince
<PB N="80" REF="85">
the Iliad, from the evidence of its title; but if the author's name was lo&s;t in Ari&s;totle's time, his antiquity is probably little &s;hort of Ho|mer's: Some &s;cholia&s;ts have given this poem to Le&s;ches, but when Le&s;ches lived and of what country he was I find no account.</P>
<P>The Cypriacs are &s;uppo&s;ed to contain the love-adventures of the Trojan ladies during the &s;iege, and probably was a poem of fiction. He|rodotus has an ob&s;ervation in his &s;econd book upon a pa&s;&s;age in this poem, in which Paris is &s;aid to have brought Helen from Sparta to Troy in the &s;pace of three days, whereas Homer &s;ays they were long driven about on their voyage from place to place; from this want of corre|&s;pondence in a fact of &s;uch con&s;equence, Hero dotus concludes upon fair grounds of critici&s;m, that Homer was not author of the Cypriacs, though Pindar a&s;cribes it to him: Some give the Cypriacs to Hege&s;ias of Salamis, others to Sta&s;inus a poet of Cyprus, and by &s;ome Homer is &s;aid to have given this poem, written by him|&s;elf, by way of portion to his daughter married to Sta&s;inus; this daughter of Homer was called Ar&s;ephone, and his &s;ons Theriphon and Theo|laus: Naevius tran&s;lated the Cypriacs into Latin ver&s;e: Many more poems are a&s;cribed to Ho|mer, which would be tedious to particularize,
<PB N="81" REF="86">
they are enumerated by Suidas, whom the reader, if his curio&s;ity &s;o inclines him, may readily con|&s;ult.</P>
<P>As to any other information per&s;onally re|&s;pecting this great poet, it has been given to the world &s;o ably by the late Mr. Wood in his e&s;&s;ay <HI>on the original genius and writings of Homer,</HI> that I can add nothing on the occa&s;ion, except the humble recommendation of my judgment in its favour. The internal evidence which this e&s;&s;ayi&s;t adduces to fix the birth-place and early re&s;idence of his poet in Ionia, is both learnedly collected and &s;atisfactorily applied: He ob&s;erves that Ho|mer in his general manner of de&s;cribing the geography of countries, &s;peaks of them as more or le&s;s di&s;tant in proportion to their bearing from Ionia; he de&s;cribes Zephyrus as a rude and boi&s;terous wind, blowing from Thrace; this circum&s;tance had been urged again&s;t Homer as a proof of his error in geography, and the &s;oft and gentle quality of Zephyrus, &s;o often cele|brated by poets in all times, is quoted in aid of the charge; but the &s;agacity and local know|ledge of Mr. Wood divert the accu&s;ation, and turn it into an argument for a&s;certaining the &s;pot of Homer's nativity and re&s;idence, by reminding us, that when the poet de&s;cribes the wind blow|ing from the Thracian mountains upon the
<PB N="82" REF="87">
Aegean &s;ea, it mu&s;t of cour&s;e be a We&s;t wind in re&s;pect to Ionia, from which circum&s;tance he draws his con&s;equence that Homer was an Ioni|an. This argument mu&s;t &s;urely be &s;atisfactory as to the place, in which the poem was written; and when we have located Homer in Ionia, whil&s;t he was employed in writing his poem, we have one point of doubt at lea&s;t cleared up in his hi&s;|tory to our conviction, and his accuracy in one branch of knowledge vindicated from the cavils of critics.</P>
<P>Having e&s;tabli&s;hed this point, viz. that Homer was an A&s;iatic Greek, inhabiting the &s;ea coa&s;t, or an i&s;land on the coa&s;t of Ionia, and having vindicated his accuracy in geographical know|ledge, the ingenious author of the e&s;&s;ay proceeds to &s;hew, by way of corollary from his propo&s;ition thus demon&s;trated, that Homer mu&s;t have been a great traveller; that geographical knowledge was in tho&s;e days no otherwi&s;e to be acquired; that he appears to have been thoroughly con|ver&s;ant in the arts of building and navigating &s;hips, as then under&s;tood and practi&s;ed; and that his map of Greece, which both Strabo, Apol|lodorus the Athenian, Menogenes and Demetri|us of Scep&s;is illu&s;trated in &s;o diffu&s;ive a man|ner, puts it out of doubt, that he mu&s;t have vi&s;ited the &s;everal countries and &s;urveyed them

with attention, before he could have laid them down with &s;uch geographical accuracy: Certain it is, that &s;o great was the authority of Homer's original chart, that it was a law in &s;ome cities that the youth &s;hould learn it by heart; that So|lon appealed to it for e&s;tabli&s;hing the right of Athens to Salamis in preference to the claims of the Megaren&s;ians; and that territorial property and dominion were in &s;everal in&s;tances decided by referring to this Homeric chart: Another evidence of Homer's travels he derives from his lively delineations of national character, which he ob&s;erves are marked with &s;uch preci&s;ion and &s;upported throughout with &s;uch con&s;i&s;tency, as not to allow us to think that he could have ac|quired this knowledge of mankind from any other &s;ource but his own ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>It is more than probable Homer did not com|mit his poems to writing; it is mere conjecture whether that invention was actually in exi&s;tence at the time he lived; there is nothing in his works that favours this conjecture, and in &s;uch a ca&s;e &s;ilence is &s;omething more than negative: The retention of &s;uch compo&s;itions is certainly an a&s;toni&s;hing effort of the human memory, but in&s;tances are not wanting of the like nature in early and uncivilized &s;tates, and the memory is capable of being expanded by habit and exerci&s;e
<PB N="84" REF="89">
to an extraordinary and almo&s;t unlimited com|pa&s;s. Unwritten compo&s;itions were always in ver&s;e; and metre was certainly u&s;ed in aid of memory. It mu&s;t not however be taken for a con&s;equence, that writing fir&s;t came into u&s;e when Pherecydes and Cadmus fir&s;t compo&s;ed in pro&s;e, as &s;ome have imagined; for it undoubtedly obtained before their time, and was probably brought into Greece from Phoenicia.</P>
<P>The engraving of the laws of Draco is &s;up|po&s;ed to have been the fir&s;t application of that art; but it was a work of labour, and required the tool of the arti&s;t, rather than the hand of the penman. Thales and Pythagoras left us no writings behind them, though they &s;pread their learning over Greece and from their &s;chools peopled it with philo&s;ophers. The unwritten drama was long in exi&s;tence before any compo|&s;itions of that &s;ort were committed to writing. Solon's laws were engraved in wood or &s;tone, and there appears to have been but one table of them. Of Lycurgus's regulations there was no written record; the mind of the judge was the depo&s;itary of the law. Draco publi&s;hed his laws in Olymp. xxxix; Pi&s;i&s;tratus died in Olymp. lxiii: A century had nearly pa&s;&s;ed between the publication of the&s;e laws and the fir&s;t in&s;titution of a public library at Athens; great advances

no doubt were made within that period in the art of writing; neverthele&s;s it was by no means an operation of facility in Pi&s;i&s;tratus's time, and his compilation of Homer's Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey was a work of va&s;t labour and of royal expence: The book remained at Athens as a princely mo|nument of his munificence and love of letters; his library was re&s;orted to by all men of &s;cience in Greece, but copies of the work were not circulated till the time of the Ptolemies; even Alexander of Macedon, when he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of a compleat copy of his favorite poet, locked it up in the rich che&s;t, of which he had de&s;poiled King Darius, as the mo&s;t worthy ca&s;e, in which he could inclo&s;e &s;o ine&s;timable a trea|&s;ure: When a copy of Homer was con&s;idered by a prince as a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;o rare, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed his written works were in many hands: As for the detached rhap&s;odies, which Lycurgus in more early times brought with him out of A&s;ia, they mu&s;t have been exceeding imperfect, though it is to be pre&s;umed they were in wri|ting.</P>

<P>FROM the &s;carcity of tran&s;cribers in the time of Pi&s;i&s;tratus, and the difficulties of collecting and compiling poems, which exi&s;ted only in the memories of the rhap&s;odi&s;ts, we are led to con&s;ider the in&s;titution of the Athenian Library, as a mo&s;t noble and important work; at the &s;ame time, when we reflect how many compo&s;itions of the earlie&s;t poets depended on the fidelity of memory, we cea&s;e to wonder that we have &s;o many more records of names than of works. Many poets are enumerated antecedent to the time of Homer; &s;ome of the&s;e have been already mentioned, and very few indeed of their fragments are now in exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Conjecture, and even fiction, have been envi|ou&s;ly &s;et to work by grammarians and others within the Chri&s;tian aera to found a charge of plagiari&s;m again&s;t Homer, and to di&s;pute his title to originality. We are told that Corinnus, who was a &s;cholar of Palamedes, inventor of the Doric letters, compo&s;ed a poem called the Iliad, whil&s;t Troy was &s;tanding, in which he celebrates the war of Dardanus again&s;t the Paphlagonians, and that Homer formed him&s;elf upon his model,
<PB N="87" REF="92">
clo&s;ely copying him: It is a&s;&s;erted by others, that he availed him&s;elf of the poems of Dictys the Cretan, who was of the family of Idomeneus, and lived in the time of the Trojan war: But the&s;e fables are &s;till le&s;s probable than the &s;tory of his conte&s;t with He&s;iod, and of the prize being decreed again&s;t him; Orpheus, Mu&s;aeus, Eu|molpus and Thamyris, all of Thrace; Mar&s;yas, Olympus, and Midas, all of the Ionian &s;ide of the Meander, were poets antecedent to Homer; &s;o were Amphion, Demodocus, Philammon, Phemius, Ari&s;taeus author of the Arima&s;pia, I&s;a|tides, Drymon, A&s;bolus the Centaur, Eumiclus the Cyprian, Horus of Samos, Pro&s;nautis of Athens, and the celebrated Sybill.</P>
<P>The five poets, who are generally &s;tiled the ma&s;ters of epic poetry, are Homer, Antimachus the Colophonian, Panya&s;is of Halicarna&s;&s;us, Pi|&s;ander of Camirus, and He&s;iod of Cumae: And all the&s;e were natives of the A&s;iatic coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Before I cea&s;e &s;peaking of Homer, I cannot excu&s;e my&s;elf from &s;aying &s;omething on the &s;ub|ject of Mr. Pope's tran&s;lation, which will for ever remain a monument of his excellence in the art of ver&s;ification: It was an arduous un|dertaking, and the tran&s;lator entered upon it with a candid confe&s;&s;ion that he was&mdash;<HI>utterly in|capable of doing ju&s;tice to Homer:</HI> he al&s;o &s;ays&mdash;
<PB N="88" REF="93">
<HI>That if Mr. Dryden had tran&s;lated the whole work, he would no more have attempted Homer after him than Virgil, his ver&s;ion of whom (not|with&s;tanding &s;ome human errors) is the mo&s;t noble and &s;pirited tran&s;lation he knows in any language.</HI> This is a declaration, that reflects as much ho|nour on Mr. Pope, as it does on Mr. Dryden; great as his difficulties were, he has neverthele&s;s executed the work in &s;uch a manner as to leave &s;tronger rea&s;ons why no man &s;hould attempt a like tran&s;lation of Homer after him, than there were why he &s;hould not have undertaken it after Mr. Dryden. One thing above all &s;urprizes me in his execution of it, which is <HI>The Catalogue of the &s;hips</HI>; a difficulty that I &s;hould el&s;e have thought infurmountable in rhime; this however he has accompli&s;hed in the &s;moothe&s;t metre, and a very curious poem it is: No further attempt therefore remained to be made upon Homer, but of a tran&s;lation in blank ver&s;e or in literal pro&s;e; a contemporary of eminence in the republic of letters has lately given a pro&s;e tran&s;lation of the Iliad, though Mr. Pope had declared in his pre|face that <HI>no literal tran&s;lation can be ju&s;t to an excellent original in a &s;uperior language.</HI>&mdash;It is ea&s;y to &s;ee what Mr, Pope aims to obtain by this po&s;ition, and we mu&s;t interpret the expre&s;|&s;ion of the word <HI>ju&s;t</HI> to mean that no &s;uch literal
<PB N="89" REF="94">
tran&s;lation can be equal to the &s;pirit, though it &s;hall be <HI>ju&s;t</HI> to the &s;en&s;e of its original: He knew full well, that no tran&s;lation in rhime could be literal, and he was therefore intere&s;ted to premi&s;e that no literal tran&s;lation could be <HI>ju&s;t</HI>; whether he has hereby vindicated his own deviations from the &s;en&s;e of his author and tho&s;e pleona&s;ms, which the &s;hackles of rhime have to a certain degree driven him into, and probably would have driven any other man much more, mu&s;t be left with the cla&s;&s;ical reader to judge for him&s;elf; &s;ome of this de&s;cription, and in particu|lar a learned Lecturer in Rhetoric, who has lately favoured the public with a collection of e&s;&s;ays, pronounce of Mr. Pope's poem <HI>that it is no tran&s;lation of Homer:</HI> The &s;ame author points out the advantages of Miltonic ver&s;e; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that Miltonic ver&s;e &s;eems to be that happy medium in metre, which &s;tands the be&s;t chance of giving the compre&s;&s;ed &s;en&s;e of Homer without deba&s;ing its &s;pirit: It is a &s;tern critici&s;m to &s;ay that Mr. Pope's <HI>is no tran&s;lation of Homer</HI>; his warme&s;t admirers will admit that it is not a clo&s;e one, and probably they will not di&s;pute but that it might be as <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> if it had a clo&s;er re&s;emblance to its original, notwith&s;tand|ing what he &s;ays in the pa&s;&s;age I have quoted from his preface. It is agreed therefore that
<PB N="90" REF="95">
an opening is &s;till left between literal pro&s;e and &s;ettered rhyme; I &s;hould conceive it might be a plea&s;ant exerci&s;e for men of talents to try a few &s;pecimens from &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages in the Iliad, as they might like be&s;t, and the&s;e perhaps might engage &s;ome one or more to proceed with the work, publi&s;hing a book at a time (as it were experimentally) by which means they might avail them&s;elves of the critici&s;ms of their candid judges, and make their final compilation more correct: If this was ably executed, a very &s;plendid work might in time be compleated to the honour of our nation and language, embel|li&s;hed with engravings of de&s;igns by our emi|nent ma&s;ters from &s;elect &s;cenes in each rhap&s;ody, according to the judgment of the arti&s;t.</P>
<P>Small engines may &s;et great machines in mo|tion, as weak advocates &s;ometimes open &s;trong cau&s;es; in that hope, and with no other pre|&s;umption whatever, I &s;hall conclude this paper with a few lines tran&s;lated from the out&s;et of the Iliad, which the reader, who&s;e patience has hitherto kept company with me, may or may not peru&s;e as he thinks fit.</P>

His contemporaries gave judgment in his favour, but po&s;terity revokes the decree: Quintilian, who probably had all his works be|fore him, pronounces of He&s;iod,&mdash;<HI>That he rarely &s;oars; that great part of his works are nothing el&s;e but catalogues and &s;trings of names, intermixed however with u&s;eful precepts gracefully delivered and appo&s;itely addre&s;&s;ed; in fine, that his merit con&s;i&s;ts in the middle &s;tile of writing.</HI>&mdash;Talents of this &s;ort probably recommended him to the un|re&s;erved applau&s;e of all, whom &s;uperiority of ge|nius in another affects with envy and provokes to detraction. Many &s;uch, be&s;ides the gram|marian Daphidas, were found to per&s;ecute the name of Homer with malevolence, whil&s;t he ro&s;e &s;uperior to their attacks: The rhap&s;odi&s;ts, who&s;e vocation it was in public and private to entertain the company with their recitations, were &s;o con&s;tantly employed in repeating Homer's poems preferably to all others, that in time they were univer&s;ally called Homeri&s;ts; Demetrius Phalereus at length introduced them into the theatres and made them chaunt the poems of his favorite author on the &s;tage: The poet Si|monides, celebrated for his memory, repeated long pa&s;&s;ages of Homer, &s;itting in the public theatre on a &s;eat erected for him on the &s;tage

for that purpo&s;e; Ca&s;&s;ander, king of Macedonia, had the whole Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey by heart, and was continually repeating, not in company only, but in his private hours to him&s;elf: Ste&s;ichorus al&s;o, the &s;ublime&s;t of all poets next to Homer and his greate&s;t imitator, was remarkably fond of chaunting forth pa&s;&s;ages in the Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey; it is related al&s;o that he u&s;ed frequently to repeat ver&s;es of He&s;iod, Archilochus, Mimnermus, and Phocylides the Mile&s;ian, who is the &s;uppo&s;ed author of the poem intitled <HI>Paraene&s;is,</HI> yet extant. We are obliged to the grammarians for many &s;craps or fragments from the wrecks of authors, but in the ca&s;e of He&s;iod's Eoics meet with one remnant only pre&s;erved by Pau&s;anias, and this relates to Iphigenia, who, by He&s;iod's account, was by the favour of Diana reprieved from ex|tinction and immortalized in the per&s;on of the godde&s;s Hecate.</P>

<P><HI>Ti&s;ias,</HI> commonly called <HI>Ste&s;ichorus</HI> from his invention of the chorus, which he &s;ung to the accompaniment of his harp, was contemporary with Solon, and born at Himera in the i&s;land of Sicily; as a lyric poet he was unequalled by any of the Greeks but Pindar; his &s;ubjects were all of the epic ca&s;t, and he oftentimes ro&s;e to a &s;ublimity, that rivalled Homer, upon who&s;e model he formed him&s;elf; this he would have done throughout according to the opinion of Quintilian, if his genius had not led him into a redundancy, but his characters are drawn with great dignity and pre&s;erved ju&s;tly.

<P><HI>Epimenides</HI> of Crete, the epic poet, was con|temporary with Solon, and there is a letter in the life of that great man in&s;erted by the &s;ophi&s;ts, which is feigned to have been written by Solon in his exile to Epimenides: This poet as well as his contemporary Ari&s;taeas is &s;aid to have had the faculty of &s;topping the functions of life and recalling them at plea&s;ure: <HI>Ari&s;taeas</HI> wrote a poem intitled Arima&s;pea, containing the hi&s;tory of the northern Arima&s;peans, a people of Scythia, whom he de&s;cribes as the fierce&s;t of all human beings and pretends that they have only one eye; he al&s;o compo&s;ed an heroic poem on the gene|alogy of the deities: Strabo &s;ays, if ever there was a quack in the world, this Ari&s;taeas was one. <HI>Simonides</HI> the poet lived in the court of Hipparchus and was much care&s;&s;ed by that elegant prince; he was a plea&s;ing courtly writer, and excelled in the pathetic. <HI>Alcaeus</HI> was poet, mu&s;ician and warrior; Quintilian gives him

<P>THERE is a con&s;iderable fragment in Athenaeus of a love-poem written by <HI>Herme&s;ianax</HI> of Colophon to his mi&s;tre&s;s Leon|tium; the poet recommends his pa&s;&s;ion by tel|ling her how love has triumphed over all the great geniu&s;es in their turns, and begins with the in&s;tances of Orpheus and Mu&s;aeus, and brings them down to Sophocles, Euripides, Py|thagoras, and Socrates.

<P>This di&s;tribution was well calculated to in|&s;pire emulation among&s;t rival &s;tates, and to that emulation Greece was indebted for the con|&s;picuous
<PB N="110" REF="115">
figure &s;he made in the world of letters. The Ionic and Italian &s;chools of philo&s;ophy were e&s;tabli&s;hed under Thales and Pythagoras; the fir&s;t was &s;upported by Anaximander the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Thales, by Socrates, Plato, Xenophon, Ari&s;totle, Diogenes, Zeno and other illu&s;trious men; Pytha|goras's &s;chool devolved upon Empedocles, He|raclitus, Zenophanes, Democritus, Pyrrho and Epicurus. The original tenets of the fir&s;t ma&s;|ters were by no means adhered to by their de|&s;cendants; the wanderings of error are not to be re&s;trained by &s;y&s;tem; hypothe&s;is was built upon hypothe&s;is, and the labyrinth at length be|came too intricate to be unravelled: Sparks of light were in the mean time &s;truck out by the active colli&s;ion of wit; noble truths occa&s;ionally broke forth, and &s;ayings, worthy to be regi&s;tered among&s;t the doctrines of Chri&s;tian revelation, &s;ell from heathen lips: in the lofty &s;pirit of phi|lo&s;ophy they in&s;ulted pain, re&s;i&s;ted plea&s;ure, and &s;et at defiance death it&s;elf. Re&s;pect is due to &s;o much dignity of character; the meek forgiving tenets, which Chri&s;tianity inculcates, were touched upon but lightly and by few; &s;ome however by the force of intellect followed the light of rea&s;on into a future &s;tate of immor|tality; they appear to have contemplated the Divine E&s;&s;ence, as he is, &s;imple and &s;upreme,
<PB N="111" REF="116">
and not filtered into attributes corruptly per&s;on|ified by a &s;ynod of divinities. Of &s;uch men we mu&s;t think and &s;peak with admiration and af|fection.</P>
<P><HI>Thales,</HI> the founder of the Ionic &s;chool, was a great man and a good citizen; he &s;tudied geo|metry under Egyptian ma&s;ters, and introduced &s;ome new di&s;coveries in a&s;tronomy and the ce|le&s;tial &s;phere, regulating and correcting the Greek calendar, which Solon, about the &s;ame time, made &s;ome attempts to reform at Athens. This he did by bringing it to a conformity with the Hebrew calendar, except that his year began with the &s;ummer &s;ol&s;tice, and that of the He|brews with the vernal. Now the Hebrew calendar compri&s;ed twelve months, and each month &s;everally compri&s;ed the &s;ame, or nearly the &s;ame, number of days as our's. This ap|pears by an examination of Mo&s;es's account of the deluge in the &s;eventh chapter of Gene&s;is.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other nations the calendar was ex|ceedingly vague and un&s;ettled: The Egyptians mea&s;ured their year by four months; the Arca|dians by three; the Carians and Acarnanians by &s;ix, and the people of Alba by ten; at the &s;ame time all the&s;e nations were in the practice of making up the year to its natural completion by intercalendary months or days. In the time
<PB N="112" REF="117">
of Romulus the Romans followed the calendar of the Albanians; and of the ten months, which their year con&s;i&s;ted of, four comprized thirty-one days each, viz. Martius, Maius, Quintilis, October; the &s;ix other con&s;i&s;ted of thirty days, and were named Aprilis, Junius, Sextilis, Sep|tember, November, December. By this calen|dar Romulus's year regularly con&s;i&s;ted of only 304 days, and to compleat the natural period he was obliged to re&s;ort to the expedient of in|tercalendary days.</P>
<P>Numa was too much of a philo&s;opher not to &s;eek a remedy for the&s;e deficiencies, and added two months to his year: The former of the&s;e he named Januarius from bifrons Janus, one of who&s;e faces was &s;uppo&s;ed to look towards the pa&s;t, and the other towards the &s;ucceeding year; the other new month he called Februarius, from Februus, the deity pre&s;iding over lu&s;trations; this being the month for the religious rites of the Dii Manes, it was made to con&s;i&s;t of twenty-eight days, being an even number; all the others, conformably to the &s;uper&s;tition of the times, con|&s;i&s;ted of odd numbers as more propitious, and accordingly Martius, Maius, Quintilis, October, had each thirty-one days, and the other &s;even, twenty-nine days, &s;o that the year, thus regula|ted, had 355 days, and it was left to the prie&s;ts
<PB N="113" REF="118">
to make up the re&s;idue with &s;upplementary days.</P>
<P>This commi&s;&s;ion became a dangerous prero|gative in the hands of the &s;acerdotal order, and was executed with much irregularity and abu&s;e; they lengthened and &s;hortened the natural period of the year, as intere&s;t influenced them to accord to the prolongation or abbreviation of the annual magi&s;tracies dependant thereupon. In this &s;tate things were &s;uffered to remain till Julius Cae&s;ar &s;ucceeded to the pontificate; he then undertook a reform of the calendar, being in his third con&s;ulate, his colleague being Oemilius Lepidus. A&s;&s;i&s;ted by the be&s;t a&s;tronomers of the time, particularly the philo&s;opher So&s;igenes, he ex|tended the year of his reform to 442 days, and thenceforward ordained that the year &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of 365 days, di&s;tributed into months as it now &s;tands, except that he added one day to February every fifth year, and not every third.</P>
<P>Thales died in the fifty-eighth Olympiad in extreme old age: The famous philo&s;opher Phe|recydes died a few years before him of that hor|rible di&s;temper called the <HI>Morbus Pediculo&s;us,</HI> and in his la&s;t illne&s;s wrote, or is &s;uppo&s;ed to have written, to Thales as follows:&mdash;</P>

<P>HAVING carried down the hi&s;tory of Athens to that period, when a new &s;pe|cies of poetry made its appearance, I propo&s;e in this place to treat of the origin and introduction of the drama; in doing this, my chief &s;tudy will be to methodize and arrange the matter, which other writers have thrown out, &s;en&s;ible that in a &s;ubject &s;o often exhau&s;ted very little el&s;e can now remain to be done.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle &s;ays&mdash;<HI>That Homer alone properly de|&s;erves the name of poet, not only as being &s;uperior to all others &s;o called, but as the fir&s;t who prepared the way for the introduction of the drama; and this he did, not merely by the di&s;play of his powers on grave and tragic &s;ubjects, but ina&s;much as he &s;ug|ge&s;ted the fir&s;t plot and device for comedy al&s;o; not founding it upon coar&s;e and opprobrious invective, but upon whole&s;ome and facetious ridicule: So that his Margites bears the &s;ame analogy to comedy, as his Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey do to tragedy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="121">This a&s;&s;ertion in favour of Homer coming from &s;uch high authority has been adopted by the &s;cholia&s;ts, critics and commentators, who have treated either of that great poet or of the drama from the time when it was made to the pre&s;ent: But it &s;hould be ob&s;erved that Ari&s;totle is not here &s;peaking of the drama profe&s;&s;edly as a chronologi&s;t, but reviewing it as an object of critici&s;m, and under this view it can no other|wi&s;e come into contemplation than in its more advanced and perfect &s;tate, when built upon the model of Homer's fables and characters; after it had thrown off the barbarous traces of its real origin, and had quitted Bacchus and the Satyrs. Of tragedy, as a written and con&s;i&s;tent poem, Homer may well be &s;tiled the father; for when Phrynichus and Ae&s;chylus introduced on the &s;cene <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, the &s;tories and calamities of heroes, tragedy became Homeric, or in other words a&s;&s;umed a dignity of tone and character, that was copied from the epic of Homer, as co|medy was from his iambic; and agreeably to this Ari&s;totle names Epicharmus as the fir&s;t co|mic poet, who was profe&s;&s;edly a copyi&s;t of the Margites.</P>
<P>Now by &s;ettling the dates of a few well-e&s;tabli&s;hed facts we &s;hall bring this que&s;tion into clo&s;er view. Pi&s;i&s;tratus after a broken reign of
<PB N="117" REF="122">
thirty-three years died in Olymp. lxiii. whereas the Marmor Chronicon records, that the fir&s;t tragedy at Athens was made my The&s;pis, and acted on a waggon in Olymp. lxi. Suidas confirms this record: From the &s;ame authority (viz. Mar. Chron.) we collect that Su&s;arion made the fir&s;t comedy at Athens, and acted it on a move|able &s;caffold in the middle of Olymp. liv. being one year before Pi&s;i&s;tratus e&s;tabli&s;hed his ty|ranny. By the&s;e dates it appears that comedy was made and acted at Athens &s;everal years before the compilation of Homer's epic poems, and tragedy before or at that time, admitting for the pre&s;ent that The&s;pis was the fir&s;t who made tragedies, and that the record above cited was the date of his fir&s;t tragedy.</P>
<P>I am aware that the&s;e facts alone will not prove that the inventors of the drama did not copy from Homer; for it cannot be denied that The&s;pis and even Su&s;arion might have re&s;orted to his poems, before they were compiled by Pi&s;i&s;tratus; and as for The&s;pis, if we were to admit the tragedies, which Suidas a&s;cribes to him, to be genuine, it is evident from their titles that &s;ome of them were built upon Ho|meric fables; but good critics find &s;trong rea&s;ons to object to this li&s;t, which Suidas has given us, and I mu&s;t think it a fair pre&s;umption again&s;t
<PB N="118" REF="123">
their authenticity, that Ari&s;totle, who gives Ho|mer the credit of furni&s;hing the fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;tions of the drama, does not in&s;tance The&s;pis's trage|dies; for had they been what Suidas reports, it can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed that Ari&s;totle would have overlooked an in&s;tance &s;o much to his purpo&s;e, or failed to have quoted The&s;pis, as the fir&s;t tragic writer, when he names Epicharmus as the fir&s;t comic one, who copied from Homer.</P>
<P>Plutarch in his Sympo&s;ia &s;ays&mdash;<HI>That when Phrynichus and Ae&s;chylus fir&s;t turned the &s;ubject of tragedy to fables and doleful &s;tories, the people &s;aid, What's this to Bacchus?</HI>&mdash;According to this anecdote how could The&s;pis, who was an|terior to Phrynichus and Ae&s;chylus, be a writer of &s;uch tragedies, as Suidas has a&s;cribed to him.</P>
<P>Another very ingenious argument for their confutation is drawn from a &s;hort fragment, which the &s;ame author has quoted from the <HI>Pentheus,</HI> one of tho&s;e tragedies which Suidas gives to The&s;pis: This fragment purports that&mdash;<HI>The Deity is &s;ituated remote from all plea&s;ure or pain</HI>: A pa&s;&s;age of this ca&s;t can never have been part of a Judicrous drama belonging to Bacchus and the Satyrs, and therefore either Plutarch mu&s;t be mi&s;taken in his anecdote above cited, or Suidas in his author of <HI>The Pentheus</HI>;
<PB N="119" REF="124">
but it is further urged by a &s;agacious critic that this fragment bears internal evidence of a for|gery, being doctrine of a later date than The&s;pis, and plainly of the fabrication of Plato's academy: In confirmation of this remark, circum&s;tances of a more po&s;itive nature are adduced, and Di|ogenes Laertius is brought forward, who actu|ally charges Heraclides of writing certain tra|gedies and fathering them upon The&s;pis, and this charge Laertius grounds upon the authority of Ari&s;toxenus the mu&s;ician: The credit of Ari&s;toxenus as a philo&s;opher, hi&s;torian, and faithful relater of facts, is as well e&s;tabli&s;hed with the learned world, as the character of He|raclides is notorious for plagiari&s;m, fal&s;ehood and affectation; he was a vain rich man, a great juggler in literature, a&s;piring to rival Plato in his writings, and one who was detected in bribing the Pythia, to decree a crown of gold and divine honours to him after his decea&s;e; a man as apt to palm his own productions upon others, as he was to a&s;&s;ume other men's productions to him|&s;elf, which he was convicted of by Chamaeleon in his &s;purious treati&s;e upon Homer and He|&s;iod.</P>
<P>This practice of fathering tragedies upon great names obtained in more in&s;tances than one; for Diony&s;ius wrote a tragedy called Par|thenopaeus
<PB N="120" REF="125">
and palmed it upon Sophocles, a bolder forgery than this of Heraclides; and it is remarkable, that Heraclides him&s;elf was caught by this forgery, and quotes the Parthenopaeus as genuine.</P>
<P>Plato &s;peaking of The Diety u&s;es the&s;e words&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">&mdash;<HI>The Deity is &s;ituated remote from all plea&s;ure and pain:</HI> A &s;entiment &s;o coincident with the frag|ment quoted by Plutarch from the Pentheus a&s;cribed to The&s;pis, &s;eems to warrant the re|mark before made, which &s;uppo&s;es it to have been fabricated in the academy of Plato: This with the authority of Ari&s;toxenus for the general forgery, and Plutarch's a&s;&s;ertion that tragedy was &s;atyric before Phrynichus and Ae&s;chylus, will have its weight again&s;t the titles of The&s;|pis's tragedies, as they are given in Suidas; and accordingly I find that the editor of Suidas, commenting upon this very article, in effect ad|mits the error of his author: This argument moreover accounts for the &s;ilence of Ari&s;totle as to The&s;pis's tragedies.</P>
<P>I am aware that it has been a que&s;tion with &s;ome critics, whether tragedy originated with The&s;pis, notwith&s;tanding the record of the Mar|mor Chronicon, and Suidas &s;tates the preten|&s;ions of Epigenes the Sicyonian prior to The&s;|pis;
<PB N="121" REF="126">
but in this he is &s;ingle and un&s;upported by any evidence, except what Plato a&s;&s;erts generally in his Minos&mdash;<HI>That tragedy was extremely antient at Athens, and that it is to be dated neither from The&s;pis, nor from Phrynichus</HI>;&mdash;Some authorities al&s;o place The&s;pis's fir&s;t tragedy in a higher period than Olymp. lxi. as it &s;tands in the Mar|mor; for Laertius &s;ays&mdash;<HI>That Solon hindered The&s;pis from acting his tragedies, believing tho&s;e feigned repre&s;entations to be of no u&s;e.</HI>&mdash;And Plu|tarch tells us&mdash;<HI>That Solon &s;aw one of The&s;pis's plays, but di&s;liking the manner of it, forbade him to act any more.</HI>&mdash;I need not ob&s;erve that this mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed before Pi&s;i&s;tratus e&s;tabli&s;hed his ty|ranny, which did not take place till the la&s;t year of Olymp. liv. but if the&s;e facts be admitted, they &s;eem to be deci&s;ive as to the tragedy's being allu&s;ive to Bacchus and the Satyrs in its fir&s;t in&s;tance at lea&s;t; becau&s;e it can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;o profe&s;t an admirer of Homer as Solon was known to be, and him&s;elf a poet, would have objected to any drama formed upon his model.</P>
<P>As to Plato's general a&s;&s;ertion with re&s;pect to the high antiquity of the Athenian tragedy, it &s;eems thrown out as a paradox, which he does not attempt to illu&s;trate or &s;upport, and I cannot think it &s;tands in the way of The&s;pis's preten&s;ions to
<PB N="122" REF="127">
be con&s;idered as the father of tragedy, confirmed by &s;o many authorities.</P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;eeming difficulties will be recon|ciled, if we concur with the be&s;t opinions in the following particulars, viz. That tragedy, which was concerned about Bacchus and the Satyrs, was in no in&s;tance committed to writing: That The&s;pis's fir&s;t tragedy, which Solon &s;aw and di&s;liked, was of this unwritten and &s;atyric &s;ort: That in proce&s;s of time the &s;ame author actually wrote tragedy, and fir&s;t acted it on a waggon in Olymp. lxi. within the aera of Pi&s;i&s;tratus, and according to the record of the Marmor Chronicon, &s;o often referred to.</P>
<P>I will not di&s;gui&s;e that Dr. Bentley, who&s;e critici&s;m is &s;o conclu&s;ive for the forgery of tho&s;e tragedies quoted by Plutarch and enumerated by Suidas, Julius Pollux and Clemens of Alex|andria, is of opinion <HI>The&s;pis him&s;elf publi&s;hed no|thing in writing</HI>; but as there are &s;o many te&s;ti|monies for his being the father of tragedy in general, and &s;ome which expre&s;sly &s;ay he was the fir&s;t <HI>writer</HI> of tragedy, I hope I &s;hall not tre&s;pa&s;s too far on my reader's patience, if I lay the chief of the&s;e authorities before him.</P>
<P>The Arundel Marble, which is of date as high as Olymp. cxxix. &s;ets forth that <HI>The&s;pis was the fir&s;t, who gave being to tragedy.</HI> The epigram
<PB N="123" REF="128">
of Dio&s;corides, printed in Mr. Stanley's edition of Ae&s;chylus, gives the invention to The&s;pis. In the Anthologia there are two epigrams, which expre&s;sly &s;ay the &s;ame; one begins&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">&mdash;the other&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">. Plutarch in his Solon &s;ays&mdash;<HI>That The&s;pis gave ri&s;e and beginning to the very rudiments of tragedy.</HI> Cle|mens of Alexandria makes The&s;pis the contriver of tragedy, as Su&s;arion was of comedy. Athe|naeus &s;ays both comedy and tragedy were &s;truck out at Icarius, a place in Attica, where The&s;pis was born. Suidas records to the &s;ame effect, and Donatus &s;peaks expre&s;sly to the point of written tragedy&mdash;<HI>The&s;pis autem primas</HI> haec &s;cripta <HI>in omnium notiti&acirc; protulit.</HI>&mdash;What Horace &s;ays of The&s;pis in his Art of Poetry, and more particularly in the Epi&s;tle to Augu&s;tus, where he cla&s;&s;es him with Ae&s;chylus and Sophocles, certainly implies that he was a <HI>writer</HI> of tragedy, and is &s;o interpreted by Cruquius and the old commentator pre&s;erved in his edition. I &s;hall add one circum&s;tance to the above authorities, which is, that the Chorus alone performed the whole drama, till The&s;pis introduced one actor to their relief; this reform could hardly be made, much le&s;s be recorded by Ari&s;totle, unle&s;s The&s;|pis
<PB N="124" REF="129">
had <HI>written</HI> tragedies and publi&s;hed them to the world.</P>
<P>Upon the whole I incline to con&s;ider The&s;pis as the fir&s;t author of the written tragedy and to place him in Olymp. lxi. From him tragedy de&s;cended through Pratinas, Carcinus and Phry|nichus to Ae&s;chylus, and this is the fir&s;t age of the tragic drama.</P>

<P>ABOUT two centuries had elap&s;ed from the date of The&s;pis's tragedy to the time when Ari&s;totle wrote his poetics; which mu&s;t have been after he quitted the &s;ervice of Alex|ander, to whom he &s;ent a copy of that treati&s;e: The chain of dramati&s;ts from The&s;pis to Euri|pedes had been continued in regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, but that he might have given a more particular and methodical account of the fir&s;t inventors of tragedy, if it had fallen within the &s;cope of his work; but this being merely critical, he takes his account of tragedy and comedy from Ae&s;chylus and Epi|charmus, contenting him&s;elf with a brief detail
<PB N="125" REF="130">
of &s;uch vague and dubious traditions relative to the fir&s;t inventors, as common fame &s;eems to have thrown in his way.</P>
<P>He loo&s;ely ob&s;erves&mdash;<HI>That the people of Me|garis claim the invention of comedy; that there is rea&s;on to think it took its origin in a popular and free form of government, which that of Megaris then was: That Epicharmus the Sicilian was far &s;enior to Chionides and Magnes, the fir&s;t Athe|nian writers of comedy</HI>:&mdash;He al&s;o throws out an idle &s;ugge&s;tion from the etymology of the words <HI>comedy</HI> and <HI>drama,</HI> the former of which he de|rives from <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, villages, and the latter from the verb <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">.&mdash;Now the people of Peloponne&s;us he tells us u&s;e the words <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in their dialect, whereas the Athenians expre&s;s them&s;elves by tho&s;e of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and upon this re&s;ts the Peloponne|&s;ians' preten&s;ions to be con&s;idered as the inventors of the drama: He then refers to what he con&s;iders as the true &s;ource and foundation of the drama, the works of Homer; and throwing a&s;ide all others, as tales not worth relating, proceeds to the execution of his plan, viz. The definition and elucidation of the tragic poem.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions were thrown out by Ari|&s;totle for no other purpo&s;e, as it &s;hould &s;eem,
<PB N="126" REF="131">
but to ca&s;t a ridicule upon every other account of the di&s;covery of the drama, but his own; for he might as well have given the invention of comedy to the Megaren&s;ians for their being no|torious laughers; <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>to laugh like a Megaren&s;ian</HI> being a phra&s;e in vulgar u&s;e with the Athenians; nay indeed he might have gone a &s;tep further and given them tragedy al&s;o, for <HI>Megaren&s;ian tears</HI> were as proverbial as <HI>Mega|ren&s;ian laughter</HI>; but a true Athenian would have an&s;wered, that the former alluded only to the onions, which their country abounded in, and was applied in ridicule of tho&s;e who counterfeited &s;orrow: In &s;hort the Megaren&s;ians &s;eem to have been the butts and buffoons of the Athenians, and held in &s;overeign contempt by them. As for the Peloponne&s;ian etymologies, Ari&s;totle mu&s;t have known that neither the one nor the other had the lea&s;t foundation; and that there is not a comedy of Ari&s;tophanes, in which he does not u&s;e the verb <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> frequently and in the mouths of Athenian &s;peakers; in his <HI>Birds</HI> I find it within a few lines of the verb <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and u&s;ed by one and the &s;ame &s;peaker; I have no doubt the like is true of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, but I did not think the &s;earch worth following.</P>
<P>Bacchus and the Satyrs were both &s;ource and
<PB N="127" REF="132">
&s;ubject of the fir&s;t drama, and the jocund rites of that deity were celebrated at all times and under all governments with the &s;ame unre&s;trained fe&s;|tivity: This celebration was too clo&s;ely inter|woven with popular &s;uper&s;tition to be checked by the mo&s;t jealous of tyrants; the privileged &s;ea&s;ons of Bacchus were out of the reach of the magi&s;trate; nor was the old &s;atyrical ma&s;que of the Athenians in Pi&s;i&s;tratus's time le&s;s licentious than that of the Megaren&s;ians in their free&s;t &s;tate; though it &s;oon happened that the republic of Megara became an oligarchy, and the mo|narchy of Athens was converted into a repub|lic.</P>
<P>The manner in which the drama was &s;truck out may naturally be accounted for. The Greeks from early time were in the habit of chanting &s;ongs and extemporary ver&s;es in the villages in prai&s;e of Bacchus at the <HI>Trina Dyoni|&s;ia,</HI> which times an&s;wer to March, April, and January; afterwards they performed the&s;e &s;ongs or dithyrambs at the Panathenaea, which were celebrated in the month of Augu&s;t. The Athe|nians were of all people living the mo&s;t addicted to raillery and invective; the&s;e village-&s;ongs and fe&s;tivities of Bacchus gave a &s;cope to the wilde&s;t extravagancies of mummery and grimace, mixt with coar&s;e but keen raillery from the
<PB N="128" REF="133">
labourers and pea&s;ants concerned in the vintage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> The women from their carts, ma&s;ked and di&s;|gui&s;ed with lees of wine, and men accoutred in rude grote&s;que habits like &s;atyrs, and crowned with garlands of ivy and violets, vented &s;uch prompt and irregular &s;allies, as their inebriated fancies furni&s;hed on the in&s;tant, or el&s;e rehear&s;ed &s;uch little traditional and local ballads in iambic metre, as were in fa&s;hion at the time; accom|panying them with extravagant ge&s;ticulations and dances incidental to the &s;ubject, and &s;uitable to the character of the deity they were cele|brating.</P>
<P>The drunken fe&s;tivities of the antient Danes, when they &s;acrificed to their rural deities&mdash;<HI>An|nuae ut ip&s;is contingeret felicitas, frugumque et an|nonae uberrimus proventus</HI>&mdash;and the Highland ce|remonies and libations of the <HI>Bel-tein</HI> are of this character.</P>
<P>The Athenian calendar was crowded with the&s;e fea&s;ts: Drinking-matches were rewarded with prizes and even crowns of gold; their phallic ceremonies were of this de&s;cription: They u&s;ed vehement ge&s;ticulations in reading and &s;peaking; their rhap&s;odi&s;ts carried this habit to exce&s;s, and in the dithyrambie hymn every outragious ge&s;ture, which enthu&s;ia&s;m in&s;pires, was put in practice: The dithyramb was con|ceived
<PB N="129" REF="134">
in a metaphorical inflated &s;tile, &s;tuffed with an ob&s;cure jargon of &s;ounding phra&s;es and performed in honour of Bacchus.</P>
<P>In the&s;e dithyrambic ver&s;es and phallic &s;ongs we have the foundation of tragedy and comedy; the &s;olemn and &s;welling tone of the fir&s;t and the petulant vivacity of the latter appo&s;itely point to the re&s;pective character of each. The &s;atire and &s;currility they indulged from their vintage wag|gons, their ma&s;ks and di&s;gui&s;es in the hairy habits of &s;atyrs, their wanton &s;ongs and dances at the Phallic ceremonies, and the dark bomba&s;t of the dithyramb chanted by the rhap&s;odi&s;ts with every tumid and extravagant action, all together form a compleat outline of the fir&s;t drama: As &s;oon as dialogue and repartee were added, it became to all intents a ma&s;que, and in this &s;tate it is di&s;|covered in very early times throughout the vil|lages of Greece. When it had reached this pe|riod and got &s;omething like the &s;hape of a dra|ma, it attracted the curio&s;ity of the villagers, who in reward for their amu&s;ement in the &s;pec|tacle decreed a prize to the performance agree|able to the object in view and the means of the &s;pectators; this prize con&s;i&s;ted of a ca&s;k of wine, and the performance before named &s;imply <HI>Comoe|dia</HI> or the <HI>village-&s;ong,</HI> was thenceforward called
<PB N="130" REF="135">

<P>The&s;e names are de&s;criptive of the drama in its progre&s;&s;ive &s;tages from a &s;imple <HI>village-&s;ong,</HI> till it took a more complicated form by intro|ducing the &s;atyrs and employing the chorus in recitation through a whole fable, which had a kind of plot or con&s;truction, though certainly not committed to writing. In this &s;tage, and not before, the prize of <HI>the ca&s;k of wine</HI> was given, and thence it proceeded to attract not the hu&s;bandmen and labourers only but the neigh|bours of better degree. The drama under the de&s;ignation of <HI>Trugoedia</HI> was &s;atyric, and wholly occupied in the prai&s;e of Bacchus; it was un|written, joco&s;e, and confined to the villages at the &s;ea&s;ons of the <HI>Trina Diony&s;ia</HI>; but after a prize however incon&s;iderable had been given, that prize created emulation, and emulation &s;ti|mulated genius.</P>
<P>The village bards now attempted to enlarge their walk, and not confining their &s;pectacles merely to Bacchus and the Satyrs began to give their drama a &s;erious ca&s;t, diverting it from lu|dicrous and la&s;civious &s;ubjects to grave and doleful &s;tories, in celebration of illu&s;trious cha|racters among&s;t their departed heroes; which were recited throughout by a chorus, without
<PB N="131" REF="136">
the intervention of any other characters than tho&s;e of the &s;atyrs with the dances proper there|unto.</P>
<P>This &s;pur to emulation having brought the drama a &s;tep forward, that advance produced fre&s;h encouragement, and a new prize was now given, which &s;till was, in conformity to the ru&s;tic &s;implicity of the poem and its audience, a <HI>Goat,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, a new prize created a new name, and the &s;erious drama became di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Tragoedia,</HI> or <HI>the &s;ong for the goat:</HI> Thus it appears that <HI>Tragedy,</HI> properly &s;o called, was po&s;terior in its origin to comedy; and it is worthy of remark that <HI>Trugoedia</HI> was never ap|plied to the tragic drama, nor <HI>Tragoedia</HI> to the comic: After this comedy lo&s;t its general de|&s;ignation of <HI>Trugoedia,</HI> and was called by its original name of <HI>the village-&s;ong</HI> or <HI>Comoedia.</HI></P>
<P>The next &s;tep was a very material one in point of advance, for the village-poets having been excited by emulation to bring their exhibi|tions into &s;ome &s;hape and con&s;i&s;tence, meditated an excur&s;ion from the villages into the cities, and particularly into Athens: Accordingly in Olymp. liv. <HI>Su&s;arion,</HI> a native of Icarius, pre|&s;ented him&s;elf and his comedy at that capital, rehear&s;ing it on a moveable &s;tage or &s;caffold, pre&s;uming on the hope that what had given &s;uch
<PB N="132" REF="137">
delight to the villagers would afford &s;ome amu&s;e|ment to the more refined &s;pectators in Athens: This was the fir&s;t drama there exhibited, and we &s;hould naturally expect that a compo&s;ition to be acted before the citizens of the capital &s;hould be committed to writing, if we did not know that the author was on the&s;e occa&s;ions the actor of his own piece; the rude interludes of Bacchus and the Satyrs being introduced upon the &s;cene according to their old extemporary manner by the <HI>Sileni</HI> and <HI>Tityri,</HI> who&s;e &s;ongs and dances were epi&s;odical to the drama: It continued to be the cu&s;tom for authors to act their own plays in the times of Phrynichus and Ae&s;chylus, and I therefore think it probable Su|&s;arion's comedy was not a <HI>written</HI> drama; and I clo&s;e with the authorities for Epicharmus being the fir&s;t <HI>writer</HI> of comedy, who, being re|tained in an elegant court at Syracu&s;e, chu&s;ing his plots from the <HI>Margites,</HI> and rejecting the mummeries of the &s;atyrs, would naturally com|po&s;e his drama upon a more regular and elabo|rate plan.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is an old gentleman of my ac|quaintance who annoys me exceedingly with his predictions: I have rea&s;on to believe he bears me good will in the main, and does not know to what a degree he actually di&s;turbs my peace of mind, I would therefore fain put up with his hu|mour if I could; but when he is for ever ringing his knell in my ears, he &s;ometimes provokes me to retort upon him, oftentimes to laugh at him, and never fails to put me out of patience or out of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>I have read your account of the <HI>Dampers</HI> with great fellow-feeling, and perceive that my old gentleman is very deep in that philo&s;ophy; but as I unfortunately have very little philo&s;ophy of any &s;ort to &s;et again&s;t it, I find my&s;elf frequently at his mercy and without defence.</P>
<P>I do not think this proceeds &s;o much from any radical vice in his nature, as from a fooli&s;h vanity to &s;eem wi&s;er than his neighbours, and to put him&s;elf off for a man who knows the world: The fact is he is an old bachelor, lives in ab&s;o|lute
<PB N="134" REF="139">
retirement, and has &s;carcely &s;tept out of the precincts of his own village three times in his life; yet he is ever telling me of his experience and his ob&s;ervations: If I was to put implicit faith in what he &s;ays, common hone&s;ty in man|kind would be a miracle, and happine&s;s a di&s;ap|pointment; as for hope, that moon&s;hine diet as he calls it, which is &s;o plentifully &s;erved up in the fanciful repa&s;ts of the poets, and which is too often the only &s;tanding di&s;h at their tables, I &s;hould never get a ta&s;te of it; and yet if ruin|ing a merchant's credit is tantamount to robbing him of his property, I mu&s;t think the <HI>Damper,</HI> who bla&s;ts my hope, is in fact little better than a thief.</P>
<P>I have a natural prejudice for certain people at fir&s;t &s;ight, where a countenance impre&s;&s;es me in its favour, for I am apt to fancy that hone&s;ty &s;ets a mark upon its owners; there is not a weakne&s;s incident to human nature, for which he could hold my under&s;tanding in more &s;ove|reign contempt: If I was to be advi&s;ed by him, I &s;hould not tru&s;t my wife out of my &s;ight, for it is a maxim with him, that no love-matches can be happy; mine was of that &s;ort and I am happy; &s;till I am out of credit with my <HI>Damper.</HI> I was bound for a relation in public tru&s;t &s;ome years ago; there I confe&s;s his augury &s;ometimes &s;tag|gered
<PB N="135" REF="140">
me, and he urged me with proverbs out of holy writ, which I was rather puzzled to par|ry; my friend however has done well in the world, di&s;charged his obligation, and repaid it with grateful returns; &s;till I am out of credit with my <HI>Damper.</HI> I inve&s;ted a &s;mall &s;um in a venture to the Ea&s;t Indies; he de&s;canted upon the ri&s;que of the &s;ea; I in&s;ured upon the &s;hip, he denounced bankruptcy again&s;t the underwriter, the &s;hip came home and I doubled the capital of my inve&s;tment; &s;till I am out of credit with my <HI>Damper,</HI> and he &s;hakes his head at my folly.</P>
<P>I can plainly perceive that his predictions oftentimes are as trouble&s;ome to him&s;elf as to me; he lo&s;es many a fine morning's walk by fore&s;eeing a change of weather; he never goes to church becau&s;e he has had a &s;uit with the par&s;on; and part of his e&s;tate remains untenant|ed, becau&s;e a farmer &s;ome time ago broke in his debt.</P>
<P>Though I am no philo&s;opher, I am not &s;uch a &s;impleton, as not to know how little we ought to depend upon worldly events in general; yet it appears to me that what a man has already enjoyed, he can no longer be &s;aid to depend upon: If therefore I have had real plea&s;ure in any innocent and agreeable ex|pectation, di&s;appointment can at wor&s;t do no
<PB N="136" REF="141">
more than remove the meat after I have made my meal.</P>
<P>Though I do not know how to define hope as a metaphy&s;ician, I am inclined to &s;peak of it with re&s;pect, becau&s;e I find it has been a good friend to me in my life; it has given me a thou|&s;and things, which malice and misfortune would have ravi&s;hed from me, if I had not fairly worn them out before they could lay their fingers upon them: <HI>Spe pa&s;cit inani</HI>&mdash;&s;ays the poet, and contradicts him&s;elf in the &s;ame breath; for my part, if it was not for the fear of appearing para|doxical, I &s;hould &s;ay upon experience that hope, though called a &s;hadow, is together with that other phantom death, the &s;ole reality beneath the &s;un; the unfaithfulne&s;s of friends, from whom I had the claim of gratitude, can never rob me of tho&s;e plea&s;ures I enjoyed, when I &s;erved them, loved them, and confided in them; and, in &s;pite of all my friend the <HI>Damper</HI> can &s;ay to the con|trary, it is not on my own account I am &s;orry to have thought better of mankind than they de&s;erve.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honour to belong to a club of gentlemen of public &s;pirit and talents, who make it a rule to meet every Sunday evening, in a hou&s;e of entertainment behind St. Clement's, for the regulation of literature in this metropolis. Our fraternity con&s;i&s;ts of two di&s;tinct orders, <HI>The Dampers</HI> and <HI>The Puffers</HI>; and each of the&s;e are again cla&s;&s;ed into certain interior &s;ubdivi&s;ions. We take notice that both the&s;e de&s;criptions of per|&s;ons have in turn been the objects of your feeble raillery; but I mu&s;t fairly tell you, we neither think wor&s;e of our&s;elves nor any better of you for tho&s;e attempts. We con&s;ider the republic of letters under obligations to us for its very ex|i&s;tence, for how could it be a republic, unle&s;s its members were kept upon an equality with each other? Now this is the very thing which our in&s;titution profe&s;&s;es to do.</P>
<P>We have an ingenious member of our &s;ociety, who has invented a machine for this purpo&s;e, which an&s;wers to admiration: He calls it&mdash;<HI>The Thermometer of Merit:</HI> This machine he has &s;et in a frame, and laid down a very accurate &s;cale of gradations by the &s;ide of it: One glance of the eye gives every author's altitude to a minute.
<PB N="138" REF="143">
The middle degree on this &s;cale, and which an|&s;wers to <HI>temperate</HI> on a common thermometer, is that &s;tandard, or common level of merit, to which all contemporaries in the &s;ame free community ought to be confined; but as there will always be &s;ome eccentric beings in nature, who will either &s;tart above &s;tandard heighth, or drop below it; it is our duty by the operation of the daily <HI>pre&s;s</HI> either to &s;crew them down, or to &s;crew them up, as the ca&s;e requires; and this brings me to explain the u&s;es of the two grand departments of our fraternity: Authors above par fall to the province of the <HI>Dampers,</HI> all be|low par appertain to the <HI>Puffers.</HI> The daily pre&s;s being common to all men, and both the one cla&s;s and the other having open acce&s;s thereto, we can work either by <HI>forcers</HI> or <HI>repel|lers,</HI> as we &s;ee fit; and I can &s;afely a&s;&s;ure you our proce&s;s &s;eldom fails in either ca&s;e, when we apply it timely, and e&s;pecially to young poets in their <HI>veal-bones,</HI> as the &s;aying is: With this view we are always upon terms with the con|ductors of the &s;aid pre&s;s, who are fully &s;en&s;ible of the benefits of our in&s;titution, and live with us in the mutual interchange of friendly offices, like Shake&s;pear's Zephyrs&mdash;

<P>THERE is a great &s;overeign now upon earth, who, though an infant, is the olde&s;t of all &s;ouls alive by many centuries.</P>
<P>This extraordinary per&s;onage is a living evi|dence of the &s;oul's immortality, or at lea&s;t has advanced &s;o far in proof, as to convince the world by his own example, that it is not nece&s;|&s;arily involved in the extinction of the body. Though he is the greate&s;t genealogi&s;t living, and can with certainty make out the longe&s;t and cleare&s;t pedigree of any potentate now reigning, yet he is properly &s;peaking without ance&s;tors. As I cannot doubt but that &s;o &s;triking an event as the general deluge mu&s;t be fre&s;h in his memo|mory, though a pretty many years have &s;ince
<PB N="141" REF="146">
elap&s;ed, he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have been none other than Noah him&s;elf; for as he has always been his own &s;on, and that &s;on can never have been living at the &s;ame moment with his father, it is plain he mu&s;t have been that very identical patriarch, when he &s;urvived the flood.</P>
<P>As he was but eighteen months old according to his corporeal computation, when he was la&s;t vi&s;ited, he was not very communicative in con|ver&s;ation, but I have hope upon the next meet|ing he will have the goodne&s;s to &s;et us right about Pythagoras, who I am per&s;uaded &s;unk &s;ome part of his travels upon us, and was actu|ally in his court, where he acted the part of a plagiary, and in the &s;chool-boy's phra&s;e <HI>cribb'd</HI> a foul copy of his holine&s;s's tran&s;migration; but with &s;uch &s;trong marks of a counterfeit, that after a &s;hort trip to the Trojan war, and a few others not worth relating, it is to be pre&s;umed he has given up the frolic; for I do not hear that he is at pre&s;ent among&s;t us, at lea&s;t not among&s;t us of this kingdom, where to &s;ay the truth I do not &s;ee any thing that re&s;embles him. In the mean time the religious &s;overeign of Ti|bet (for the reader perceives I have been &s;peak|ing of <HI>Te&eacute;&s;hoo Lama</HI>) in the &s;pirit of an original keeps his &s;eat upon the Mu&s;nud of Terp&acirc;ling,
<PB N="142" REF="147">
which throne he has continued to pre&s;s ever &s;ince his de&s;cent from Mount Ararat.</P>
<P>After all we mu&s;t acknowledge this was a bold creed for prie&s;tcraft to impo&s;e, but credulity has a wide &s;wallow, and if the doctrine pa&s;&s;ed upon a nation &s;o philo&s;ophical and inqui&s;itive as the Greeks, it may well obtain unque&s;tioned by Calmuc Tartars; and &s;uper&s;tition, now retiring from Rome, may yet find refuge in the moun|tains of Tibet. This may be &s;aid for the &s;y&s;tem of Te&eacute;&s;hoo Lama, that impo&s;ition cannot be put to a fairer te&s;t, than when committed to the &s;implicity of a child; and the <HI>Gylongs,</HI> or prie&s;ts, attendant upon this extraordinary infant, paid no &s;mall compliment to the faith of their followers, when they &s;et him upon the Mu&s;nud.</P>
<P>I forbear entering into a further account of this infant pontiff, becau&s;e I hope the very in|genious traveller, who has already circulated &s;ome curious particulars of his audiences and interviews at the mona&s;tery of Terp&acirc;ling, will indulge the public with a more full and circum|&s;tantial narrative of his very intere&s;ting expedi|tion into a country &s;o little vi&s;ited by Euro|peans, and where the manners and habits of the people, no le&s;s than the &s;acred character of the &s;overeign, furni&s;h a &s;ubject of &s;o new and enter|taining a nature.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="148">When a genius like that, which actuates the illu&s;trious character, who lately admini&s;tered the government of Bengal, is carried into the re|mote&s;t regions of the earth, it diffu&s;es an illumi|nation around it, which reaches even to tho&s;e nations, where arts and &s;ciences are in their highe&s;t cultivation; and we accordingly find that be&s;ides this emba&s;&s;y, &s;o curious of its kind, the &s;ame pervading &s;pirit has penetrated into the &s;acred and till now inacce&s;&s;ible my&s;teries of the Brahmins, and by the attainment of a language which religion has interdicted from all others but the &s;acerdotal ca&s;t, has already began to lay open a volume, &s;uperior in antiquity, and per|haps in merit not inferior, to Homer him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Happy inhabitants of Tibet! If happine&s;s can ari&s;e from error, your innocent illu&s;ion mu&s;t be the &s;ource of it; for prie&s;tcraft, which has plun|ged our portion of the globe in wars and per|&s;ecutions, has kept you in perpetual peace and tranquillity; &s;o much more wi&s;e and &s;alutary is your religious &s;y&s;tem of pontifical identity, than ours of pontifical infallibility. The &s;ame un|changeable, indivi&s;ible object of faith &s;ecures univer&s;al acquie&s;cence under the commodious impo&s;ition: No Anti-Lama can di&s;tract your attention or divide your duty, for individuality is his e&s;&s;ence; no councils can rever&s;e his de|crees

or over-rule his &s;upremacy, for he is coeval with religion, nay he is religion it&s;elf. Such as he was in his praeterient body, &s;uch he mu&s;t be in his pre&s;ent; the &s;ame mona&s;tic, peaceful, un|offending, pious being; a living idol, drawn forth upon occa&s;ional &s;olemnities to give his ble&s;&s;ing to adoring pro&s;trate hordes of Tartars, and to receive their offerings; and whether this ble&s;&s;ing be given by the hands of unrea&s;oning infancy, or &s;uperannuated age, it matters little at which degree the moment points, when the &s;cale is undeterminable. <HI>You &s;ee me here</HI> (&s;aid the Lama in his praeterient body to one of our countrymen, whom he admitted to a conver&s;a|tion) <HI>a mere idol of &s;tate: You are of a more active nation; take your wonted exerci&s;e without re&s;erve: Walk about my chamber: I am &s;edentary by nece&s;|&s;ity, and the habit of indolence is become to me a &s;econd nature<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>&mdash;This is a true anecdote, and &s;hews how mild a &s;oul it is, which has now tran&s;migrated into the body of this infant.</P>

<P>I HAVE now the &s;atisfaction to inform my countrymen, that after long and diligent &s;earch I have at la&s;t di&s;covered a very extraordi|nary per&s;on in this metropolis, at pre&s;ent in &s;ome ob&s;curity; but if I &s;hall luckily be the means of drawing him into more notice by pub|li&s;hing what has come to my knowledge of his talents and performances, I &s;hall think my&s;elf happy not only in &s;erving a meritorious indivi|dual, but al&s;o in furni&s;hing a &s;ugge&s;tion through the mode I &s;hall recommend for his employ, that may be of the greate&s;t benefit to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The gentleman, in who&s;e favour I would fain intere&s;t my candid readers, is <HI>Mr. Jedediah Fi&s;h,</HI> of who&s;e hi&s;tory I &s;hall recount a few particulars. He was bred to the law, and many years ago went over to New England, where he practi&s;ed in the courts at Bo&s;ton: Upon the breaking out of the troubles he came over to England, tho'
<PB N="146" REF="151">
from his prudent deportment he might &s;afely have remained where he was, for Mr. Fi&s;h made it a rule never to lend any thing but an ear to either &s;ide of the que&s;tion: I cannot &s;peak with certainty as to his real motives for leaving Ame|rica, as he has not been communicative on that head, but I could collect from hints he has dropt of the extraordinary length and protraction of the pleadings in tho&s;e provincial courts, that his health was a good deal impaired by his attend|ance upon cau&s;es, though I cannot di&s;cover that he was actually employed as an advocate in any. This may &s;eem &s;ingular to &s;uch as are unac|quainted with tho&s;e proceedings, but Mr. Fi&s;h, though no pleader, was of indi&s;pen&s;able u&s;e to his clients during the &s;omnolency of the court; for by means of his vigilance the efficient coun&s;el could indulge them&s;elves in their natural re&s;t, and recruit their &s;pirits for a reciprocal exertion of prolixity, when the oppo&s;ite party had come to a conclu&s;ion: This happy faculty of wake|fulne&s;s in Mr. Jedediah Fi&s;h was accompanied with the further very u&s;eful talent of abridge|ment, by which in a very few words he could convey into the ear of a pleader, when he had once thoroughly wakened him, the whole marrow of an argument, though it had been &s;pread out ever &s;o widely.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="152">When he came over to his native country, he threw him&s;elf in the way of preferment, and regularly attended the &s;ittings at We&s;tmin&s;ter, Guildhall, and el&s;ewhere; but being a mode&s;t man, and one who made no acquaintance, he was no otherwi&s;e taken notice of, than as being the only per&s;on in court, who did not yawn, when a certain learned &s;erjeant got beyond his u&s;ual quota of ca&s;es in point. Nothing offering here, Mr. Fi&s;h pre&s;ented him&s;elf during the &s;itting of Parliament both at the bar of the Peers, and in the gallery of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons; he gave great attention to the clerks, when they were reading Acts of Parliament in the upper hou&s;e, and never quitted his po&s;t in the lower, when certain gentlemen were on their legs, and gave the &s;ignal to others to get on theirs and go to dinner: By being thus left alone this mode&s;t attendant lo&s;t his labour, and remained unnoticed through a whole &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Defeated in all the&s;e efforts he began to fre|quent Coffee-hou&s;es, where he ob&s;erved mo&s;t talking prevail, and few or no hearers to be found: Fortune now began to &s;mile upon his patient endeavours, and he particularly recom|mended him&s;elf to a circle at Saint Paul's, where by his addre&s;s in po&s;ting him&s;elf between two parties, one of which was very circum&s;tantially
<PB N="148" REF="153">
explaining a will, and the other going &s;tep by &s;tep through a bill of enclo&s;ure, where the glebe lands of the rector were in great peril of infringement, he &s;o contrived as to lend one ear to the divine and the other to the civilian, by which he got a dinner at each of their hou&s;es; and as they found him a mo&s;t agreeable companion, and one who&s;e chearing &s;mile enlivened their own conver&s;ation, he &s;oon became free of their families under a &s;tanding invitation.</P>
<P>It was in one of the&s;e hou&s;es I fir&s;t became acquainted with Mr. Fi&s;h, and as it &s;eemed to me a great pity that a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch companionable talents (for I can &s;afely aver I had never heard the tone of his voice) &s;hould be any longer buried in ob&s;curity, or at be&s;t confined to a narrow circle of admirers, I began to reflect within my&s;elf what amazing improve|ments &s;ociety might receive, if he could be in|duced to &s;tand forth in the public character of <HI>A Ma&s;ter of Silence,</HI> or in other words <HI>A Teacher of the Art of Hearing.</HI></P>
<P>As I knew my friend was not a man to &s;peak for him&s;elf, I took a convenient occa&s;ion one day of breaking my propo&s;al to him, which I in|troduced by &s;aying I had &s;omething to di&s;clo&s;e to him, which I conceived would not only be of public benefit, but might al&s;o be turned to his

<P>A NOVEL, conducted upon one uniform plan, containing a &s;eries of events in fa|miliar life, in which no epi&s;odical &s;tory is inter|woven, is in effect a protracted comedy, not divi|ded into acts. The &s;ame natural di&s;play of cha|racter, the &s;ame facetious turn of dialogue and agreeable involution of incidents are e&s;&s;ential to each compo&s;ition. Novels of this de&s;cription are not of many years &s;tanding in England, and &s;eem to have &s;ucceeded after &s;ome interval to romance, which to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it is a mo&s;t unnatural and mon&s;trous production. The <HI>Don Quixote</HI> of Cervantes is of a middle &s;pecies; and the <HI>Gil Blas,</HI> which the Spaniards claim and the French have the credit of, is a &s;eries of adven|tures rather than a novel, and both this and Don
<PB N="153" REF="158">
Quixote abound in epi&s;odical &s;tories, which &s;e|parately taken are more properly novels than the mother work.</P>
<P>Two authors of our nation began the fa&s;hion of novel-writing, upon different plans indeed, but each with a degree of &s;ucce&s;s, which perhaps has never yet been equalled: Richard&s;on di&s;po&s;ed his fable into letters, and Fielding pur&s;ued the more natural mode of a continued narration, with an exception however of certain mi&s;cel|laneous chapters, one of which he prefixed to each book in the nature of a prologue, in which the author &s;peaks in per&s;on: He has executed this &s;o plea&s;antly, that we are reconciled to the interruption in his in&s;tance; but I &s;hould doubt if it is a practice in which an imitator would be wi&s;e to follow him.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have ob&s;erved, that modern noveli&s;ts have not confined them&s;elves to comic fables or &s;uch only as have happy endings, but &s;ometimes, as in the in&s;tance of <HI>The Clari&s;&s;a,</HI> wind up their &s;tory with a tragical cata&s;trophe; to &s;ubjects of this &s;ort perhaps the epi&s;tolary mode of writing may be be&s;t adapted, at lea&s;t it &s;eems to give a more natural &s;cope to pathetic de&s;criptions; but there can be no doubt that fables replete with humorous &s;ituations, characteri&s;tic dialogue and bu&s;y plot are better &s;uited to the mode,
<PB N="154" REF="159">
which Fielding has pur&s;ued in his inimitable novel of <HI>The Foundling,</HI> univer&s;ally allowed the mo&s;t perfect work of its &s;ort in ours, or probably any other, language.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;o attractive to readers of all de&s;criptions in the&s;e books, and they have been &s;ought with &s;uch general avidity, that an incredible number of publications have been produced, and the &s;cheme of circulating libraries lately e&s;tabli&s;hed, which the&s;e very publications &s;eem to have &s;ugge&s;ted, having &s;pread them through the kingdom, novels are now become the amu&s;ing &s;tudy of every rank and de&s;cription of people in England.</P>
<P>Young minds are &s;o apt to be tinctured by what they read, that it &s;hould be the duty of every per&s;on, who has the charge of education, to make a proper choice of books for tho&s;e who are under their care; and this is particularly nece&s;&s;ary in re&s;pect to our daughters, who are brought up in a more confined and dome&s;tic manner than boys. Girls will be tempted to form them&s;elves upon any characters, whether true or fictitious, which forcibly &s;trike their imaginations, and nothing can be more point|edly addre&s;&s;ed to the pa&s;&s;ions than many of the&s;e novel heroines. I would not be under&s;tood to accu&s;e our modern writers of immoral de&s;igns;
<PB N="155" REF="160">
very few I believe can be found of that de&s;crip|tion; I do not therefore object to them as cor|rupting the youthful mind by pictures of im|morality, but I think &s;ome among&s;t them may be apt to lead young female readers into affecta|tion and fal&s;e character by &s;tories, where the manners, though highly charged, are not in na|ture; and the more intere&s;ting &s;uch &s;tories are, the greater will be their influence: In this light a novel heroine, though de&s;cribed without a fault, yet, if drawn out of nature, may be a very unfit model for imitation.</P>
<P>The novel, which of all others is formed upon the mo&s;t &s;tudied plan of morality, is <HI>Clari&s;&s;a,</HI> and few young women I believe are put under re&s;triction by their parents or others from grati|fying their curio&s;ity with a peru&s;al of this au|thor; guided by the be&s;t intentions, and con|&s;cious that the moral of his book is funda|mentally good, he has taken all po&s;&s;ible pains to weave into his &s;tory incidents of &s;uch a tragical and affecting nature, as are calculated to make a &s;trong and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on the youthful heart. The unmerited &s;ufferings of an innocent and beautiful young lady, who is made a model of patience and purity; the unnatural obduracy of her parents; the infernal arts of the wretch, who violates her, and the &s;ad cata&s;trophe of her
<PB N="156" REF="161">
death, are incidents in this affecting &s;tory better conceived than executed: Failing in this mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential point, as a picture of human nature, I mu&s;t regard the novel of Clari&s;&s;a as one of the books, which a prudent parent will put under in|terdiction; for I think I can &s;ay from ob&s;ervation, that there are more artificial pedantic characters a&s;&s;umed by &s;entimental Mi&s;&s;es in the vain de&s;ire of being thought <HI>Clari&s;&s;a Harlows,</HI> than from any other &s;ource of imitation what&s;oever: I &s;u&s;pect that it has given food to the idle pa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e eternal &s;cribblings, which pa&s;s between one fe|male friend and another, and tend to no good point of education. I have a young lady in my eye, who made her will, wrote an in&s;cription for the plate of her own coffin, and for&s;wore all man|kind at the age of &s;ixteen. As to the charac|ters of Lovelace, of the heroine her&s;elf, and the heroine's parents, I take them all to be beings of another world. What Clari&s;&s;a is made to do, and what &s;he is allowed to omit, are equally out of the regions of nature. Fathers and mothers, who may oppo&s;e the inclinations of their daugh|ters, are not likely to profit from the examples in this &s;tory, nor will tho&s;e daughters be di&s;po&s;ed to think the wor&s;e of their own rights, or the better of their parents, for the black and odious colours in which the&s;e unnatural characters are
<PB N="157" REF="162">
painted. It will avail little to &s;ay, that Clari&s;&s;a's mi&s;eries are derivable from the fal&s;e &s;tep of her elopement, when it is evident that elopement became nece&s;&s;ary to avoid compul&s;ion. To &s;peak with more preci&s;ion my opinion in the ca&s;e, I think Clari&s;&s;a dangerous only to &s;uch young per&s;ons, who&s;e characters are yet to be formed, and who from natural &s;u&s;ceptibility may be prone to imitation, and likely to be turned a&s;ide into errors of affectation. In &s;uch hands, I think a book, &s;o addre&s;&s;ed to the pa&s;&s;ions, and wire-drawn into &s;uch prolixity, is not calculated to form either natural manners or natural &s;tile; nor would I have them learn of Clari&s;&s;a to write long pedantic letters <HI>on their bended knees,</HI> and beg <HI>to ki&s;s the hem of their ever-honoured Mam|ma's garment,</HI> any more than I would wi&s;h them to &s;purn at the addre&s;&s;es of a worthy lover with the pert in&s;ult of a <HI>Mi&s;s How.</HI></P>
<P>The natural temper and talents of our chil|dren &s;hould point out to our ob&s;ervation and judgment the particular mode, in which they ought to be trained: The little tales told to them in infancy, and the books to be put into their hands in a forwarder age, are concerns highly worth attending to. Few female hearts in early youth can bear being &s;oftened by pa|thetic
<PB N="158" REF="163">
and affecting &s;tories without prejudice. Young people are all imitation, and when a girl a&s;&s;umes the pathos of Clari&s;&s;a without experi|encing the &s;ame afflictions, or being put to the &s;ame trials, the re&s;ult will be a mo&s;t in&s;ufferable affectation and pedantry.</P>
<P>Whatever errors there may be in our pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of education, they are not the errors of neglect; on the contrary perhaps they will be found to con&s;i&s;t in over-diligence and too great &s;olicitude for accompli&s;hment; the di&s;tribution of a young lady's hours is an analy&s;is of all the arts and &s;ciences; &s;he &s;hall be a philo&s;opher in the morning, a painter at noon, and a mu&s;ician at night; &s;he &s;hall &s;ing without a voice, play without an ear, and draw without a talent. A variety of ma&s;ters di&s;tract the attention and overwhelm the genius; and thus an indi&s;crimi|nate zeal in the parent &s;tops the cultivation and improvement of tho&s;e particular branches, to which the talents of the child may more imme|diately be adapted. But if parents, who thus pre&s;s the education of their children, fall into mi&s;takes from too great anxiety, their neglect is without excu&s;e, who, immer&s;ed in di&s;&s;ipation, delegate to a hireling the mo&s;t &s;acred and mo&s;t natural of all duties: To the&s;e unprofitable and
<PB N="159" REF="164">

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THOUGH I do not like paradoxes, and can readily acknowledge the re&s;pect due to general opinions, yet I am bold to aver to the face of all tho&s;e fine gentlemen, who, if they think as they act, will laugh me to &s;corn for the notion, that marriage is a mea&s;ure of &s;ome con&s;equence. I do not mean to &s;ay that it is nece&s;&s;ary, in the choice of a wife, that &s;he &s;hould be of any particular &s;tature or complexion, brown or fair, tall or &s;hort; neither do I think a man of family need ab&s;olutely to in&s;i&s;t upon as many clear de&s;cents, as would &s;atisfy a German Count, before he quarters arms with a lady; nor do I article for fortune, or connection, or any other worldly recommendation as indi&s;pen&s;able; &s;atisfied only if it will be granted to me that the parties ought not to unite without &s;ome mutual explanation, &s;ome previous under&s;tanding of
<PB N="163" REF="168">
each other's temper, and &s;ome rea&s;onable ground of belief, that the contract they are about to enter into for life is likely to hold good to the end of the term, for which it is made.</P>
<P>I am not &s;o ignorant of the world as not to know how many &s;pecious rea&s;ons may be given on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion; and being &s;en&s;ible I have a hard point to drive, I am willing to conciliate my opponents by all rea|&s;onable conce&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Faro</HI> married to pay off a mortgage, that encumbered his e&s;tate, and to di&s;charge certain debts of honour, that encumbered his mind &s;till more: His match therefore was a match of principle; and though a run of bad luck defeated his good intentions towards his creditors, and though the vulgar manners of his lady &s;melt &s;o &s;trong of the city, that &s;he became in&s;upportable, yet all the world allowed that the mea&s;ure was judicious, ju&s;tifiable, and in his lord&s;hip's &s;itua|tion indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P><HI>Lady Bab Petti&s;h</HI> married <HI>Colonel Spectre</HI> becau&s;e he haunted her in all a&s;&s;emblies, was for ever at her back in the Opera-hou&s;e, glided into the church when &s;he was at her devotions, and de|clared in all companies that he was determined to have her. Lady Bab married to be revenged
<PB N="164" REF="169">
of him; nobody denied but &s;he took the right method, and all the world allowed that &s;he had her revenge: The colonel is literally a <HI>&s;pectre</HI> at this moment.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Harry Blu&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;s Hornet</HI> were fir&s;t cou&s;ins, and though brought up together in the &s;ame hou&s;e like brother and &s;i&s;ter, &s;quabbled and fought like dog and cat: Sir Harry's face bore the marks of her nails, and Mi&s;s's head-dre&s;s was the frequent victim of his fury. This young pair made a match in the laudable expectation of a better agreement after wedlock: All the world applauded their motives, and the event fully an&s;wered their expectation&mdash;for they parted <HI>by con&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>Old <HI>Lady Lucy Lumbago</HI> was told by a for|tune-teller that &s;he &s;hould die a maid: When &s;he was at lea&s;t &s;ixty years in advance towards fulfilling the prediction, &s;he drew a piece of wedding cake through a bride's gold ring, and dreamt of her own footman: She married him the next week to thwart the De&s;tinies: The footman went off with her &s;trong-box, and left her behind to compleat the prophecy.</P>
<P><HI>Lord Calomel</HI> had a plentiful e&s;tate and a very &s;canty con&s;titution, but he had two rea&s;ons for marrying, which all the world gave him credit for; the fir&s;t was to get an heir, which he want|ed,
<PB N="165" REF="170">
and the &s;econd was to get rid of a mi&s;tre&s;s he was tired of: He made his choice of <HI>Mi&s;s Frolick,</HI> and every body allowed the odds were in his favour for an heir: The lady brought him a full-grown boy at five months end; his lord|&s;hip drove his wife out of his hou&s;e and rein|&s;tated his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Jack Fanciful</HI> had a blind-&s;ide towards a fine eyebrow.

<P>IN the plan, which I have laid down for treating of the literature of the Greeks, and to which I have devoted part of the&s;e papers, I have thought it advi&s;eable for the &s;ake of per|&s;picuity to preface the account with an ab&s;tract
<PB N="170" REF="175">
of the Athenian hi&s;tory within tho&s;e &s;eparate periods, which I mean to review. In con|formity to this plan I have already brought down my narration to the death of Pi&s;i&s;tratus, and this has been followed with a &s;tate of the drama at that period: I now propo&s;e to proceed with the hi&s;tory to the battle of Marathon inclu&s;ive, beyond which I &s;hall have no occa&s;ion to follow it, and &s;hall then re&s;ume my account of the lite|rature of the Greeks, which will comprehend all the dramatic authors, both tragic and comic, to the death of Menander.</P>
<P>At the decea&s;e of Pi&s;i&s;tratus the government of Athens devolved quietly upon Hipparchus, who a&s;&s;ociated his brother Hippias with him in power. Pi&s;i&s;tratus had two other &s;ons by a &s;e|cond wife, who were named Jophon and The&s;|&s;alus; the elder died in his father's life time, and the other, who was of a turbulent and unruly &s;pirit, did not long &s;urvive him.</P>
<P>Hipparchus was no le&s;s devoted to &s;cience and the liberal arts than his father had been: The famous Phaea, who had per&s;onated Miner|va, &s;hared his throne, and though he commu|nicated with his brother Hippias on matters of government, and imparted to him &s;o great a portion of authority, that they were jointly &s;tiled Tyrants of Athens, yet it &s;eems evident that the
<PB N="171" REF="176">
&s;upreme power was actually ve&s;ted in Hippar|chus; and it is extraordinary, for the &s;pace of fourteen years until his death, his government was undi&s;turbed by any di&s;agreement with his brother or complaint from his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t virtuous citizens of Athens, in the free&s;t hours of their republic, look back upon this reign as the mo&s;t enviable period in their hi&s;tory. Plato him&s;elf a&s;&s;erts that all the fabu|lous felicity of the golden reign of Saturn was realized under this of Hipparchus: Thucydides gives the &s;ame te&s;timony, and &s;ays that his go|vernment was admini&s;tered without envy or re|proach: The tradition of the golden days of Hipparchus was delivered down through many generations, and became proverbial with the Athenians. A prince, who had de&s;erved &s;o well of letters, was not likely to be forgotten by poets, hi&s;torians, or philo&s;ophers; but &s;uch was the public tranquillity under his admini&s;tration, that the patriots and declaimers for freedom in the mo&s;t popular times have not &s;crupled to acknowledge and applaud it.</P>
<P>Hipparchus not only augmented the collection of books in the public library, but engaged &s;eve|ral eminent authors to re&s;ide at Athens: He took Simonides of Ceos into his pay at a very high &s;tipend, and &s;ent a fifty-oared galley for
<PB N="172" REF="177">
Anacreon to Teos, inviting him with many princely gifts to live at his court: He cau&s;ed the poems of Homer to be publicly recited at the great a&s;&s;embly of the Panathenaea, and is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ugge&s;ted the plan of collecting the &s;cattered rhap&s;odies of the Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey, &s;o happily executed by his father. His private hours he devoted to the &s;ociety of men of letters, and on the&s;e occa&s;ions was ac|companied by Simonides the lyric poet, Ono|macritus, Anacreon and others. He did not confine his attention to the capital of his empire, but took a method, well adapted to the times he lived in, of reforming the under&s;tandings of his more di&s;tant and le&s;s enlightened &s;ubjects in the villages, by erecting in con&s;picuous parts of their &s;treets or market-places &s;tatues of the god Mer|cury, placed upon terms or pede&s;tals, on which he cau&s;ed to be in&s;cribed &s;ome brief &s;entence or maxim, &s;uch as&mdash;<HI>Know thy&s;elf&mdash;Love ju&s;tice&mdash;Be faithful to thy friend</HI>&mdash;and others of the like general utility.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to devi&s;e a project better calcu|lated for the edification of an ignorant people than the&s;e &s;hort but comprehen&s;ive &s;entences, &s;o ea&s;y to be retained in the memory, and which, being recommended both by royal and divine
<PB N="173" REF="178">
authority, claimed univer&s;al attention and re|&s;pect.</P>
<P>This excellent and mo&s;t amiable prince was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by Harmodius and Ari&s;togiton, and a revolution being in the end effected favourable to the popular government of Athens, the a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins were celebrated to all po&s;terity as the a&s;|&s;erters of liberty and the deliverers of their country. Of all the rulers of mankind, who have fallen by the hand of violence, how few have been &s;acrificed in the public &s;pirit of ju&s;tice, and how many have fallen by the private &s;tab of revenge! When we contemplate the elder Brutus brandi&s;hing the dagger of Lucretia, we cannot help recollecting that Tarquinius Superbus had murdered his brother. Hippar|chus is &s;aid to have put an affront upon Har|modius's &s;i&s;ter by di&s;mi&s;&s;ing her from a religious proce&s;&s;ion, in which &s;he was walking at the fe&s;|tival of the Panathenaea: Harmodius was the hand&s;ome&s;t youth in Attica, and the prince is by the &s;ame account charged with having con|ceived an unnatural pa&s;&s;ion for him, in which he was repul&s;ed. If this account were to be credit|ed in the whole, it would be an incident of &s;o unmanly a &s;ort on the part of Hipparchus, as to leave an everla&s;ting mark of di&s;grace upon a character, otherwi&s;e meritorious.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="179">The general prevalence of a turpitude, which neither the religion nor the laws of Greece actually prohibited, may induce our belief of the charge again&s;t Hipparchus, as far as concerns Harmodius; but the &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;ult to the &s;i&s;ter is irreconcileable to his character. It were far more natural to &s;uppo&s;e his re&s;entment &s;hould have been pointed again&s;t Ari&s;togiton, who was the favorite of Harmodius; &s;uch circum&s;tances as we have now related would have carried their own con&s;utation upon the face of them, even though hi&s;torians had not greatly varied in their accounts of the tran&s;action; but when &s;o re&s;pect|able an author as Plato gives the narrative a turn entirely oppo&s;ite to the above, whil&s;t modern hi&s;torians have only retailed vulgar errors with|out examining te&s;timonies of better credit, I hope I may be allowed the equitable office of &s;umming up the evidences in this my&s;terious tran&s;action, for the purpo&s;e of re&s;cuing a mo&s;t amiable character from mi&s;repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>Plato in his Hipparchus &s;ays&mdash;<HI>That the current account above given was not the account believed and adopted by people of the be&s;t condition and re|pute; that the in&s;ult vulgarly &s;uppo&s;ed to have been put upon the &s;i&s;ter of Harmodius by Hipparchus was ridiculous and incredible upon the face of it; that Harmodius was the di&s;ciple of Ari&s;togiton, a</HI>
<PB N="175" REF="180"><HI>man of ordinary rank and condition; that there was a mutual affection between the pupil and his ma&s;ter; that they had admitted into their &s;ociety a young Athenian of di&s;tinction, who&s;e name had e&s;caped his memory, of whom they were very fond, and whom they had by their conver&s;ation and in&s;tructions im|pre&s;&s;ed with high ideas of their talents and crudition; that this young Athenian having found acce&s;s to the per&s;on of Hipparchus, attached him&s;elf to his &s;ociety and began to fall off from his re&s;pect for his former preceptors, and even treated their inferiority of un|der&s;tanding with contempt and ridicule; that there|upon they conceived &s;uch hatred and re&s;entment again&s;t the prince for this preference &s;hewn by their pupil for his company, and for the method he had taken of mortifying their vanity, that they determin|ed upon di&s;patching Hipparchus by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, which they accordingly effected.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;tin gives a different account and &s;ays&mdash;<HI>That the affront was put upon the &s;i&s;ter of Harmo|dius not by Hipparchus but by his brother Diocles; that Harmodius with his friend Ari&s;togiton entered into a con&s;piracy for cutting off all the reigning family at once, and pitched upon the fe&s;tival of the Panathenaea as a convenient time for the execution of their plot, the citizens being then allowed to wear arms; that the complete execution of their de&s;ign was fru&s;trated by one of their party being ob&s;erved in</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="181">
<HI>earne&s;t di&s;cour&s;e with Hippias, which occa&s;ioned them to &s;u&s;pect a di&s;covery, and &s;o precipitated their attack before they were ready; that in this attack however they chanced upon Hipparchus, and put him to death.</HI></P>
<P>There are other accounts &s;till differing from the&s;e, but they have no colour of probability, and only prove an uncertainty in the general &s;tory.</P>
<P>Plutarch relates&mdash;<HI>That Venus appeared to Hip|parchus before his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination in a dream, and from a phial, which &s;he held in her hand, &s;prinkled his face with drops of blood.</HI> Herodotus al&s;o &s;ays&mdash;<HI>That he was warned by a vi&s;ion on the eve of his murder, being addre&s;&s;ed in &s;leep by a man of extra|ordinary &s;tature and beauty, in ver&s;es of an enig|matical import, which he had thoughts of con&s;ulting the interpreters upon next morning, but afterwards pa&s;&s;ed it off with contempt as a vapour of the imagi|nation, and fell a &s;acrifice to his incredulity.</HI></P>
<P>This at lea&s;t is certain, that he governed the capricious inhabitants of Attica with &s;uch perfect temper and di&s;cretion, that their tranquillity was without interruption; nor does it appear that the people, who were erecting &s;tatues and tro|phies to his murderers, in commemoration of the glorious re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of their freedom, could charge him with one &s;ingle act of oppre&s;|&s;ion;
<PB N="177" REF="182">
and perhaps if Hippias, who &s;urvived him, had not galled them with the yoke of his tyranny during the few years he ruled in Athens after the death of Hipparchus, the public would not have joined in &s;tiling th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins the deliverers of their country, who were known to be guided by no other motives than private malice and re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Harmodius was killed on the &s;pot; Ari&s;to|giton fled and was &s;eized in his flight. The part, which Hippias had now to act, was delicate in the extreme; he was either to puni&s;h with &s;uch rigour, as might &s;ecure his authority by terror, or endear him&s;elf to the people by the virtue of forbearance: He had the experience of a long admini&s;tration conducted by his brother on the milde&s;t and mo&s;t merciful principles; and, if the&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins had been without accom|plices, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e he would not have rever&s;ed a &s;y&s;tem of government, which had been found &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful; but as it appeared that Harmodius and Ari&s;togiton were joined by others in their plot, he thought the Athenians were no longer to be ruled by gentle means, and that no other alternative remained, but to re&s;ign his power, or enforce it with rigour.</P>

<P>HIPPIAS began his mea&s;ures by putting Ari&s;togiton to the torture; he &s;eized the per&s;on of Leaena a courtezan, who was in the &s;ecret of the con&s;piracy, but whil&s;t he was at|tempting to force her to a confe&s;&s;ion, &s;he took the re&s;olute method of preventing it by biting off her tongue. Ari&s;togiton with revengeful cunning impeached &s;everal courtiers and inti|mates of the tyrant. Athens now became a &s;cene of blood; executions were multiplied, and many principal citizens &s;uffered death, till the informer having &s;atiated his vengeance upon all, who were obnoxious to him or friendly to Hip|pias, at length told the tyrant that he had been made the dupe of fal&s;e accu&s;ations, and tri|umphed in the remor&s;e that his confe&s;&s;ion oc|ca&s;ioned: Some accounts add that he de&s;ired to whi&s;per to Hippias, and in the act &s;uddenly &s;eized his ear with his teeth, and tore it from his head.</P>
<P>Hippias henceforward became a tyrant in the wor&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word; he racked the people with taxes, ordered all the current coin into the royal coffers upon pretence of its deba&s;ement, and for the period of three years continued to

oppre&s;s the &s;tate by many grievous methods of exaction and mi&s;rule. His expul&s;ion and e&s;cape at length &s;et Athens free, and then it was that the Athenians began to celebrate the action of Harmodius and Ari&s;togiton with rapture and applau&s;e; from this period they were regarded as the &s;aviours of their country; a public edict was put forth, directing that no &s;lave, or per&s;on of &s;ervile condition, &s;hould in future bear the names of the&s;e illu&s;trious citizens; a&s;&s;ignments were made upon the Prytaneum for the mainte|nance of their de&s;cendants, and order was given to the magi&s;trate &s;tiled Polemarchus to &s;uperin|tend the i&s;&s;ue of the public bounty; their po&s;|terity were to rank in all public &s;pectacles and proce&s;&s;ions as the fir&s;t members of the &s;tate, and it was delivered in charge to the &s;uperintendants of the Panathenaea, that Harmodius and Ari&s;to|giton &s;hould be celebrated in the recitations chaunted on that &s;olemnity. There was a po|pular ode or &s;ong compo&s;ed for this occa&s;ion, which was con&s;tantly performed on that fe&s;tival, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been written by Calli|&s;tratus: It grew &s;o great a favourite with the Athenians, that it became a general fa&s;hion to &s;ing it at their private entertainments; &s;ome fragments of the comic poets are found to allude to it, and &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the plays of Ari&s;to|phanes.

<P>The four la&s;t lines of this ode are quoted by Athenaeus, and I al&s;o find among&s;t the adulatory ver&s;es made in commemoration of the&s;e illu&s;tri|ous tyrannicides a di&s;tich written by Simonides of Ceos, congratulating with the Athenians on their delivery from the tyranny of Hipparchus: This poet is made famous to po&s;terity for his memory, which was almo&s;t miraculous; it is to be lamented that it &s;hould fail to remind him of &s;uch a patron and benefactor. The lines are not worth tran&s;lating; the author and the &s;ubject re|flect no honour upon each other.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tatues, which the Athenian arti&s;ts ever ca&s;t in metal, were the brazen &s;tatues erect|ed in honour of Harmodius and Ari&s;togiton, in the fir&s;t year of Olymp. lxviii. thirteen years after the murder of Hipparchus, when I&s;agoras was archon, and the memorable aera of Rome, when Tarquinius Superbus was dethroned and expelled: They were con&s;picuou&s;ly placed in the forum of Athens, and it was a curious event, after the revolution of five centuries, that the &s;tatue of the younger Brutus, when he had killed Cae&s;ar, was placed between the&s;e very &s;tatues,
<PB N="182" REF="187">
erected in the year when his ance&s;tor expelled the Tarquins: They were the workman&s;hip of Antenor; and Xerxes, when he plundered Athens, removed them out of Greece from other motives probably than of re&s;pect to their intrin&s;ic merit: They were in &s;ucceeding time re&s;tored to the city, but whether by Alexander after his defeat of Darius, by Antiochus, or by the munificence of Seleucus, authorities are not agreed; I am inclined to think they were given back by Seleucus. There were two others of the &s;ame materials afterwards ca&s;t by Critias, and again two others, the workman&s;hip of the celebrated Praxiteles. Pliny &s;ays the&s;e la&s;t-men|tioned &s;tatues were of con&s;ummate beauty and excellence, and there is rea&s;on to think they were the fir&s;t performances of that great ma&s;ter in metal. The honour of a &s;tatue in bra&s;s was rarely decreed by the Athenians to any of their mo&s;t illu&s;trious citizens, and few other in&s;tances occur, except one to Solon, and one to Conon for his &s;ervices again&s;t the Lacedaemonians. The expedient made u&s;e of to perpetuate the heroic con&s;tancy of Leaena was ingenious, for as it was not fitting to erect a public &s;tatue to a courte|zan, they devi&s;ed the figure of a lione&s;s in allu|&s;ion to her name, which they ca&s;t in bra&s;s, and without a tongue in memory of the re&s;olute

The mea&s;ures of Hippias during the time he reigned alone, which &s;carce exceeded three years, bla&s;ted the merits of his predece&s;&s;ors, and embittered the minds of the Athenians again&s;t his family to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>

and of its alliances, was at this time in condition to a&s;&s;ume a leading &s;hare in the affairs of Greece, and it was the fir&s;t object of Cli|&s;thenes and I&s;agoras to engage the Lacedaemo|nians in their party for the emancipation of Athens; to carry this point with a people, &s;o jealous of the Athenian greatne&s;s, required &s;ome engine of per&s;ua&s;ion more powerful than philan|thropy or the dictates of common ju&s;tice; the Temple of Delphi opened a re&s;ource to them, and by a &s;ea&s;onable bribe to the Pythia they en|gaged her to give &s;uch re&s;pon&s;es to her Lace|daemonian clients on all occa&s;ions, as &s;hould work upon their &s;uper&s;tition to accord to their wi&s;hes.</P>

<P>CLISTHENES and I&s;agoras had now ef|fected a complete revolution in favour of liberty, but being men of ambitious &s;pirit and of equal preten&s;ions, the &s;tate was &s;oon thrown into fre&s;h convul&s;ion by their factions. Cli|&s;thenes made his court to the people, I&s;agoras again had recour&s;e to the Lacedaemonians.</P>
<P>Lacedaemon, always di&s;po&s;ed to controul the growing con&s;equence of her neighbours, and &s;en&s;ible of the bad policy of her late mea&s;ures, had opened her eyes to the folly of expelling Hippias upon the forged re&s;pon&s;es of the Pythia, of who&s;e corruption and fal&s;e dealing &s;he had now the proofs: She complied with the requi|&s;itions of I&s;agoras &s;o far as related to her inter|ference at large, but in the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e of that inter|ference &s;he by no means met his wi&s;hes, for it was immediately re&s;olved to invite Hippias into Sparta, where he was publicly acknowledged

and received, and a herald &s;ent to Athens with a haughty me&s;&s;age to Cli&s;thenes and his party. The Athenians, intimidated and divided, threw them&s;elves upon new and de&s;perate re&s;ources, &s;ending an emba&s;&s;y, or rather petition, to the Per&s;ian &s;atrap Artaphernes, brother of the reign|ing king Darius, and governor of Lydia.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ian had not at this time ever heard the name of Athens, and peremptorily demanded homage; the amba&s;&s;adors yielded to the demand, but the &s;tate revoked it at their return with in|dignation; for the Corinthians had in the mean time taken mea&s;ures very favourable to their intere&s;ts, by &s;eparating from the Lacedaemonian alliance and prote&s;ting &s;trongly again&s;t the pro|po&s;al of re&s;toring Hippias; their oppo&s;ition &s;eems to have been founded in principle, having lately experienced a tyranny of the &s;ame &s;ort in their own per&s;ons, and they carried their point by compelling Hippias to return in de&s;pair to Si|geum, from whence he betook him&s;elf to Lamp|facus, where he began to cabal in the court of Aeantides the tyrant, who was in great favour with the Per&s;ian monarch. By this channel Hippias introduced him&s;elf to Darius, and with all the inveteracy of an exiled &s;overeign, not abated by age or length of ab&s;ence, became a principal in&s;trument for promoting his expedi|tion
<PB N="187" REF="192">
into Greece, which concluded in the me|morable battle of Marathon, at which he was pre&s;ent, twenty years after his expul&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was fortunate for the liberties of Athens, that, when &s;he &s;ent her emba&s;&s;y to Artaphernes, he required as an indi&s;pen&s;able condition of his aid that Hippias &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in his tyranny. A more dangerous &s;tep could not have been re&s;olved upon than this of inviting the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Per&s;ian, and in this applaud|ed aera of liberty it is curious to remark &s;uch an in&s;tance of deba&s;ement, as this emba&s;&s;y into Lydia: The memory however of pa&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion was yet too fre&s;h and poignant to &s;uffer the Athenians to &s;ubmit to the condition required, and nothing remained but to prepare them&s;elves to face the re&s;entment of this mighty power: With this view they gave a favourable reception to Ari&s;togaras the Mile&s;ian, who was canva&s;&s;ing the &s;everal &s;tates of Greece to &s;end &s;upplies to the Ionians, then on the point of falling under the dominion of Per&s;ia: Lacedaemon had refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to him, and peremptorily di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him out of their territory: From Athens he obtain|ed the &s;uccours he &s;olicited, in twenty gallies well manned and appointed: The Athenian forces, after &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful operations, &s;uffered a defeat by &s;ea, and the breach with Per&s;ia became
<PB N="188" REF="193">
incurable. Before the &s;torm broke immediately upon Athens, the Per&s;ian armies were employed again&s;t the frontier colonies and i&s;lands of Greece with uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s: They de|feated the Phoenician fleet and reduced Cyprus; many cities on the Helle&s;pontic coa&s;t were added to their empire; in the confines of the Troade &s;everal places were taken; impre&s;&s;ions were made upon Ionia and Aeolia by the forces of Artamenes and Otanes, and in further proce&s;s of the war the rich and beautiful city of Miletus was be&s;ieged and taken, and the inhabitants of both &s;exes removed into the Per&s;ian territery, and colonized upon new lands: The i&s;les of Chios, Le&s;bos and Tenedos &s;hared the &s;ame fate, and not a city in Ionia, that had been in|volved in the defection, but was &s;ubjected in its turn: In the Helle&s;pont and Propontis every thing on the European &s;hore was reduced, toge|ther with the important &s;tation of Chalcedon; the like &s;ucce&s;s followed their arms in the Thra|cian Cher&s;one&s;us. The&s;e operations were &s;uc|ceeded by the next year's campaign under the conduct of Mardonius, the &s;on of a &s;i&s;ter of Darius, a young and inexperienced general; and the check, which the power of Per&s;ia re|ceived this year by the wreck and di&s;per&s;ion of their fleet off the coa&s;t of Macedonia, under
<PB N="189" REF="194">
Mount Athos, in the Singitic bay, afforded the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;onable re&s;pite from the ill-fortune of the war.</P>
<P>At length the formidable torrent, which had &s;o long threatened Athens at a di&s;tance, &s;eemed ready to bur&s;t upon her, and &s;urely a more un|equal conte&s;t never occupied the attention of mankind. Mardonius, who had been &s;o un&s;uc|ce&s;sful in his fir&s;t campaign, was now &s;uper&s;e|ded, and the va&s;t army of Per&s;ia was put under the joint command of Datis a Mede, and the younger Artaphernes, nephew to king Darius and &s;on to the Prefect of Lydia. The&s;e com|manders pur&s;ued a different route by &s;ea from what Mardonius had taken, avoiding the un|lucky coa&s;t of Macedonia, and falling upon Euboea in the neighbourhood of Attica by a &s;trait cour&s;e through the Aegean Sea. Having reduced the city of Cary&s;tus, they laid &s;iege to Eretria the capital of Euboea; the Athenians had reinforced the garri&s;on with four thou&s;and troops; but although the Eretrians for a time &s;tood re&s;olutely to the defence of their city, it was given up by treachery on the &s;eventh day and pillaged and de&s;troyed in a mo&s;t barbarous manner, the very temples being involved in the common ruin and conflagration.</P>
<P>Having &s;truck this &s;troke of terror under the
<PB N="190" REF="195">
very eye of Athens, the Per&s;ians embarked their troops, and pa&s;&s;ing them over the narrow chan|nel, which &s;eparates Attica from Euboea, landed for the fir&s;t time on Athenian ground, and en|camped their va&s;t army upon the &s;andy plain of Marathon.</P>
<P>Hippias, who had been now twenty years in exile, and in who&s;e aged bo&s;om the fires of am|bition were not yet extingui&s;hed, accompanied the Per&s;ian forces into his native country, and according to the mo&s;t probable accounts was &s;lain in action. If any death can be glorious in a guilty cau&s;e, this of Hippias may be &s;o account|ed; to have brought three hundred thou&s;and men in arms, after a career of victory, landed them on the Athenian territory, and there to have put the very exi&s;tence of his country to the i&s;&s;ue of a combat, was an a&s;toni&s;hing effort both of mind and body, at a period of life which hu|man nature rarely attains to. Ten thou&s;and Greeks under the command of Miltiades di&s;|comfited this overgrown ho&s;t in a pitcht battle upon an open plain, where all the Per&s;ian num|bers could act; but it has often happened that a &s;mall band of di&s;ciplined warriors have wor&s;ted an irregular multitude, how great &s;oever. The army of Darius was broken and repul&s;ed; &s;ix thou&s;and were left on the field, and the fugitives
<PB N="191" REF="196">
returned into A&s;ia overwhelmed with &s;hame and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>This memorable day e&s;tabli&s;hed the liberty and the glory of Athens, and from this we are to look forward to the mo&s;t illuminated age in the annals of mankind. Though Hippias had &s;everal children, who &s;urvived him, yet as his de&s;cendants never gave any further di&s;turb|ance to the liberties and con&s;titution of Athens, we are henceforward to con&s;ider the race of Pi|&s;i&s;tratus as hi&s;torically extinct.</P>
<P>The friend of freedom, who reviews them as tyrants, will di&s;mi&s;s them with reproach; we, who have regarded them only as patrons of lite|rature, may take leave of them with a &s;igh.</P>

Bacchus and his Satyrs were expelled, and a new &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, built upon &s;hort fables &s;elected from the poems of Homer, &s;ucceeded to the village ma&s;que, and numbers of ingenious competitors began to apply them&s;elves to the work.</P>

<P><HI>Phrynichus,</HI> the tragic poet, was the &s;on of Melanthus and the di&s;ciple of The&s;pis: Suidas thinks there was another of the name, &s;on of Chorocles, who al&s;o wrote tragedies, but there is rea&s;on to think he is an error. This Phryni|chus fir&s;t introduced the mea&s;ure of tetrametres; this he did becau&s;e the trochaic foot is mo&s;t pro|per for dancing, and the drama of this age was
<PB N="195" REF="200">
accompanied with dances characteri&s;tic and ex|planatory of the fable. There were ma&s;ters pro|fe&s;&s;edly for the purpo&s;e of compo&s;ing and teach|ing the&s;e dances, and in &s;ome in&s;tances the author performed in per&s;on; hence it was that the early dramati&s;ts were called <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, or <HI>Dancers.</HI> When tragedy was in a more im|proved &s;tate, and the bu&s;ine&s;s was no longer conducted by dance and &s;pectacle, but commit|ted to dialogue, they changed the tetrametres to iambics, which Ari&s;totle ob&s;erves were fit for declamation rather than &s;inging with the accom|paniment of the dance.</P>
<P>This author was the fir&s;t who produced the female ma&s;k upon the &s;cene; he took upon him|&s;elf the ta&s;k of in&s;tructing the dancers and per|formed in per&s;on; accordingly we find him bur|le&s;qued by Ari&s;tophanes in his la&s;t &s;cene of <HI>The Wa&s;ps,</HI> on account of his extravagant ge&s;ticula|tions&mdash;<HI>He &s;trikes and flutters,</HI> &s;ays the old hu|mouri&s;t Philocleon, <HI>like a cock; he capers into the air, and kicks up his heels to the &s;tars:</HI> Whil&s;t Philocleon is capering on the &s;tage after this fa&s;hion, the &s;on, who is on the &s;cene, ob&s;erves&mdash;<HI>This is not agility, it is in&s;anity. It is either the plot of a tragedy,</HI> replies the &s;ervant, <HI>or the caprice of a madman; give him hellebore; the man's be&s;ide him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="201">Dancing was &s;o e&s;&s;ential a part of the fir&s;t &s;cenic &s;pectacle, and the people were &s;o attached to their old Bacchanalian cu&s;toms, that the early reformers of the tragic drama found it no ea&s;y ta&s;k to make the dance accord to the &s;ubject of the &s;cene and weave it into the fable. This was generally under&s;tood to be done under the di|rection of the poet, and in many ca&s;es he was principal performer in per&s;on; but where an au|thor was not competent to this part of his duty, he called in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a profe&s;t ballet-ma&s;ter, who formed dances upon the incidents of the drama, and in&s;tructed the chorus how to perform them. There is a very eminent profe&s;|&s;or of this art upon record, named <HI>Tele&s;tes,</HI> who had the honour of a &s;tatue decreed to him, which was con&s;picuou&s;ly placed within the theatre, whil&s;t tho&s;e of the mo&s;t celebrated poets were not admitted to a nearer approach than the &s;teps or portico. The&s;e dances prevailed till after the time of Ae&s;chylus, when they were finally laughed out of fa&s;hion by the parody of the &s;a|tyrical comedy.</P>
<P>Though the fate of Phrynichus's tragedy on the <HI>Siege of Milctus</HI> has been frequently men|tioned, I cannot here omit the &s;tory. This beautiful city had been lately &s;acked by the Per|&s;ian troops; it was the capital and pride of
<PB N="197" REF="202">
Ionia, a very antient colony of the Athenians, &s;ettled by Neleus, &s;on of Codrus, the la&s;t and mo&s;t beloved of their kings: Of its riches and renown Strabo tells us the account would ex|ceed belief; it had given birth to men illu&s;trious for &s;cience and for military fame: Thales, Anaximander and Anaximenes in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion had been natives of Miletus; Hecataeus the hi&s;torian was born there, as were his contemporaries Hi&s;|tiaeus and Ari&s;togaras, celebrated men, who took &s;o great a lead in the affairs of the Ionians introductory to the inva&s;ion of the Per&s;ians, and to who&s;e con&s;picuous talents even Darius him|&s;elf, when exulting at their death, gave the ho|nourable tribute of his applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Such was the city, upon who&s;e deplorable fate Phrynichus founded his tragedy; the &s;pecta|cle di&s;&s;olved his audience into tears; the na|tional and affecting &s;cene operated on the &s;en&s;i|bility of the Athenians in &s;o &s;erious a manner, that the magi&s;tracy thought it a ca&s;e fit for their interference, and by public edict prohibited any author in future to touch upon that melan|choly &s;ubject: Nor was this all, they put a hea|vy fine upon the poet. His judgment certainly wanted correction; but it &s;hould have been the correction of an indi&s;cretion rather than of a crime: As the trag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">dy, like its &s;ubject, is long
<PB N="198" REF="203">
&s;ince peri&s;hed, we cannot properly decide upon the &s;everity of the edict; it mu&s;t be owned the event was too recent and dome&s;tic; the idea of &s;uch a city in flames, the de&s;truction of its tem|ples and the ma&s;&s;acre of its inhabitants, many of whom perhaps had friends and relations pre|&s;ent at the &s;pectacle, was not to be &s;upported. It is not the province of the drama to attack the human heart with &s;uch realities; the whole re|gion of invention is open to its choice, free to work its moral purpo&s;es by pity or by terror; but if a plot is to be con&s;tructed upon truth, the tragic hi&s;tory is to be taken from time far di&s;|tant, or from &s;cenes out of the &s;pectator's know|ledge. <HI>Plectere non frangere</HI> is the poet's motto; if he terrifies, let him not rend the heart; if he &s;oftens, let him not &s;educe it: The man, who is melted with pity, becomes as a child, but he is the child of his poet, and has a claim upon him for the protection of a parent.</P>
<P>This author exhibited a famous tragedy, in|titled <HI>Pyrrhici&s;tae,</HI> or <HI>the Dance of armed Soldiers:</HI> The Athenians were charmed with the martial manner, in which he conducted this &s;pectacle, and Aelian &s;ays they made him their general, and put him at the head of their army for his &s;kill and addre&s;s in the performance: If it were &s;o, it would &s;eem to have been the fate of Phry|nichus
<PB N="199" REF="204">
to be puni&s;hed without mercy, and re|warded without merit; but the anecdote does not obtain with good critics, and it is clear that the poet lived in a more early period than Phry|nichus the general, for the lowe&s;t date we have of him, whom we are &s;peaking of, is the cir|cum&s;tance given by Plutarch in his Themi&s;|tocles, viz. That in Olymp. lxxv.4. Phryni|chus bore away the prize with his tragedy (pro|bably <HI>The Phaeni&s;&s;ae</HI>) in compliment to Themi&s;|tocles, who was at the charge of the repre&s;enta|tion, and who in commemoration thereof &s;et up the following in&s;cription&mdash;<HI>Themi&s;tocles of the pa|ri&s;h of Phreari was at the charge; Phrynichus made the tragedy, and Adimantus was archon.</HI></P>

<P>Ae&s;chylus, though he had ju&s;t rea&s;on to value him&s;elf highly on his poetical talents, yet, like Alcaeus and Archilochus, continued through life to hold his military character more at heart than his literary one, and directed to be engraved on his tomb-&s;tone a di&s;tich in long and &s;hort ver&s;e, in which he appeals <HI>to the field of Marathon and the long-haired Mede</HI> to witne&s;s to his valour; by the Mede he probably means the general Datis. The per&s;onal gallantry, for which Ae&s;chylus and his brethren were &s;o con&s;picuous, gives a &s;trong and manly colouring to his com|po&s;itions; it is the characteri&s;tic of his genius, and his pen, like his &s;word, is a weapon of terror: The &s;pectacle, which his drama exhibits, is that of one &s;ublime, &s;imple &s;cene of awful magnificence; his &s;entiment and &s;tile are in uni&s;on with his &s;ubject, and though he is charged with having written his tragedies in a &s;tate of ebriety, to which he was in general ad|dicted, &s;till they do not betray the traces of a confu&s;ed imagination, as Sophocles in&s;inuated, though occa&s;ionally they may of an in&s;lated one; and it was a weakne&s;s in Sophocles (to give his motive no wor&s;e a name) to pronounce of Ae&s;chylus, <HI>that he did not know what he did,</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="207">
<HI>although he did things well</HI>; as if he had written in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute intoxication and mental di&s;ability; an imputation, which convicts it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Ae&s;chylus's exce&s;s was the vice of his time and nation, I might add of his profe&s;&s;ion al&s;o as a &s;oldier; and one &s;hould almo&s;t &s;u&s;pect that he con&s;idered it as a becoming quality in a hero, &s;eeing that he had the hardine&s;s to exhibit Ja&s;on drunk upon the &s;cene, an attempt which &s;tands recorded as the fir&s;t of the &s;ort, though after|wards he was followed in it by Epicharmus and Crates, comic poets, and in later times even by the &s;ententious Euripides him&s;elf: In &s;hort the literary annals of Greece are deeply &s;tained with this exce&s;s, and the &s;tage at one period was far from di&s;couraging it.</P>
<P>Ae&s;chylus not only in&s;tructed his chorus in the dances incidental to the piece, but &s;uperin|tended al&s;o and arranged the dre&s;&s;es of the per|formers with the mo&s;t correct preci&s;ion; and this he did in a ta&s;te &s;o dignified and character|i&s;tic, that the prie&s;ts and &s;acrificing mini&s;ters of the temples did not &s;cruple to copy and adopt his fa&s;hions in their habiliments: He did not in|deed perform on the &s;tage as Phrynichus did, but he never permitted the intervention of a ma&s;ter, as many others did: The dances, which
<PB N="203" REF="208">
he compo&s;ed for his tragedy of <HI>The Seven Chiefs,</HI> were particularly appo&s;ite to the &s;cene, and were performed with extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s and ap|plau&s;e: He brought fifty furies at once on the &s;tage in the chorus of his <HI>Eumenides,</HI> and di&s;|played them with &s;uch accompaniments and force of effect, that the whole theatre was petri|fied with horror, pregnant women mi&s;carried on the &s;pot, and the magi&s;tracy interpo&s;ed for the prevention of &s;uch &s;pectacles in future, and limit|ed the number of the dancers, annexing a penal|ty to the breach of the re&s;triction. Ari&s;tophanes has an allu&s;ion to the Eumenides of Ae&s;chyius in his comedy of the <HI>Plutus,</HI> (Act ii.

<P><PB N="204" REF="209">That the poet Ae&s;chylus was of a candid mind appears from his well-known declaration, viz. <HI>That his tragedies were but &s;craps from the magnificent repa&s;ts of Homer</HI>; that he was of a lofty mind is from nothing more evident, than from his celebrated appeal upon a certain occa|&s;ion, when the prize was voted to his compe|titor evidently again&s;t ju&s;tice&mdash;<HI>I appeal to po&s;te|rity,</HI> &s;ays Ae&s;chylus, <HI>to po&s;terity I con&s;ecrate my works, in the a&s;&s;urance that they will meet that reward from time, which the partiality of my contemporaries refu&s;es to be&s;tow.</HI></P>
<P>Though the candour of Ae&s;chylus called his tragedies fragments or &s;craps from Homer, and &s;eemed to think it &s;ufficient honour to be able to wield with tolerable grace one weapon out of the armoury of this gigantic &s;pirit, yet I would &s;ubmit to the reader's judgment, whether the tragic poem does not demand a &s;tronger ex|ertion of the mental faculties within the com|pa&s;s of its compo&s;ition than the epic poem. In a drama, where every thing mu&s;t be in action, where characters mu&s;t be &s;trongly marked and clo&s;ely compre&s;&s;ed, the pa&s;&s;ions all in arms, and the heart alternately &s;eized by terror and &s;ub|dued by pity, where the diction mu&s;t never &s;leep in detail, nor langui&s;h in de&s;cription, but be lofty yet not dilated, eloquent but not loqua|cious,
<PB N="205" REF="210">
I have no conception how the human ge|nius can be &s;trained to greater energy: At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be admitted that the continu|ation of exertion, which the epic requires, in|ferior though it may be in force, falls heavie&s;t on the poet of that department; the &s;cope of his work is much more diffu&s;ed, and hi&s;tory perhaps pre&s;ents &s;o few fit &s;ubjects to his choice, that we cannot wonder at the general predilection of the literary world for dramatic compo&s;ition; lea&s;t of all can we want a rea&s;on why the Greeks, an animated and ingenious race of writers, addicted to &s;pectacle and devoted to mu&s;ic and dancing, &s;hould fall with &s;uch avidity upon the flowery province of the drama.</P>
<P>But when they made it a conte&s;t as well as a &s;tudy, when they hung up wreaths and crowns as the reward of victory, and turned dramatic &s;pectacles into a kind of Olympic games, they brought a crowd of competitors to the li&s;ts. The magi&s;trate generally, and private citizens in particular ca&s;es, furni&s;hed the exhibition at an immen&s;e expence, and with a degree of &s;plendor we have little conception of. The happy poet crowned with the wreath of triumph, pre&s;enting him&s;elf to the acclamations of a crowded theatre, felt &s;uch a flood of triumph, as in &s;ome in&s;tances to &s;ink under the ec&s;tacy and expire on the &s;pot;
<PB N="206" REF="211">
whil&s;t on the other hand di&s;appointment operat|ing upon &s;u&s;ceptible and &s;anguine minds, has been more than once productive of effects as fatal: Such minds, though they claim our pity, do not merit our re&s;pect, and it is a con&s;olation to reflect, that where there is a genius like that of Ae&s;chylus, there is generally found a conco|mitant magnanimity, which can di&s;regard with con&s;cious dignity the fal&s;e misjudging decrees of the vulgar.</P>
<P>The appeal, which Ae&s;chylus made to po&s;te|rity, was &s;oon verified, for after his death the Athenians held his name in the highe&s;t venera|tion, and made a decree for furni&s;hing the ex|pence of repre&s;enting his tragedies out of the public pur&s;e; he carried away many prizes du|ring his life, and many more were decreed to his tragedies after his death: A &s;tatue was erected in memory of him at Athens, and a picture was painted de&s;criptive of his valour in the fight at Marathon.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other rea&s;ons &s;ugge&s;ted for his leaving Athens, &s;ome a&s;&s;ert that he retired in di&s;gu&s;t at being &s;uper&s;eded in a prize by So|phocles, who was a very young competitor; but a vague a&s;&s;ertion of this invidious &s;ort is readily confuted by the character of Ae&s;chylus, to which it is not reconcileable upon any other

than the &s;tronge&s;t authority. It is agreed that he removed to Sicily to the court of king Hiero, where he was very honourably received, and after three years re&s;idence died and was buried in a &s;umptuous and public manner: The fable of the eagle dropping a tortoi&s;e on his head, and his being killed by the blow, was probably allegorical, and emblematical of his genius, age and decay. Valerius Maximus however gives the &s;tory for truth, and refers to the authorities of Ari&s;to|phanes, Pliny, and Suidas, concluding his ac|count with the following expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;<HI>Eoque ictu origo et principium fortioris tragoediae extinctum e&s;t.</HI> He died at the age of &s;ixty-nine years, after a life &s;pent alternately in great labour and great exce&s;s. This event took place in the fir&s;t year of Olymp. lxxxi. In Olymp. lxx. when he was between twenty and thirty years old, he conte&s;t|ed the prize with Pratinas and Chaerilus, when Myrus was archon; <HI>Chaerilus</HI> was an Athenian, and wrote tragedies to the amount of one hun|dred and fifty, of all which not even a fragment &s;urvives. At the battle of Marathon Ae&s;chylus was thirty-&s;even years old; twelve years after this celebrated action Xerxes pa&s;&s;ed into Greece at the head of his armies, burnt Athens, and carried off the library collected by Pi&s;i&s;tratus and his &s;ons. When Ae&s;chylus was turned of
<PB N="208" REF="213">
fifty he carried away the prizes with his trage|dies of <HI>Phineus, The Per&s;ae, Glaucus Potnien&s;is,</HI> and <HI>The Prometheus.</HI> Three years before his death he performed his <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and bore away the prize with that, with <HI>The Choephoris, The Eumenides</HI> and <HI>The Proteus,</HI> a &s;atyric drama, the charges of the theatre being defrayed by Xenocles Aphidneus. If he pa&s;&s;ed into Sicily therefore he mu&s;t have left Athens immediately after this &s;ucce&s;s, and this is another circum|&s;tance, which makes again&s;t the &s;tory of his di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>At the death of Ae&s;chylus, Sophocles was in his twenty-&s;eventh year, and Euripides in his twenty-fir&s;t: Chionides and Dinolochus, writers of the old comedy, flouri&s;hed in his time; as did the philo&s;ophers Zeno Eleates, Anaxagoras and Parmenides: Socrates was in his twenty-&s;econd year, when Ae&s;chylus died, and Pindar died two years before him.</P>

<P>The decree, which Ari&s;tophanes makes Bac|chus pronounce in favour of Ae&s;chylus, is by implication as deci&s;ive again&s;t Sophocles as again&s;t Euripides, for Sophocles declares his ac|quie&s;cence under the judgment, if it &s;hall be given for Ae&s;chylus, but if otherwi&s;e he avows him&s;elf ready to conte&s;t the palm with Euri|pides:

A circum&s;tance which &s;ufficiently di&s;|criminates the mode&s;t complacency of his cha|racter from the peevi&s;h di&s;putatious temper of Euripides: It is at the &s;ame time an implied confirmation of the pre-eminence of the&s;e three tragic poets over all other competitors in that department of the drama, and puts Ae&s;chylus at the head of the triumvirate.

<P>It appears therefore, that, although we have few remains of the Greek tragedy, yet they are remains of the be&s;t ma&s;ters. There are autho|rities which &s;ay that Ae&s;chylus wrote above one hundred tragedies, and the titles of all the&s;e have been collected and publi&s;hed by Meur&s;ius; &s;even only &s;urvive; the like number of Sophocles and a few more of Euripides comprize all the re|mains of the Greek tragedy now in our po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion: But although the&s;e are highly valuable
<PB N="212" REF="217">
as being &s;pecimens of the be&s;t ma&s;ters, it does not follow that they are the be&s;t, or among&s;t the be&s;t, performances of their re&s;pective au|thors: At all events we can judge but in part from &s;o &s;mall a proportion, and as the&s;e authors were in the habit of forming their dramas upon plots that were a continuation of the &s;ame &s;tory, it mu&s;t be to the di&s;advantage of any one piece, that happens to come down to us disjunctively, as in the in&s;tance of the <HI>Prometheus</HI> of Ae&s;chylus, and more which might be named among&s;t the remains of the two other &s;urviving poets.</P>
<P>We have now Engli&s;h tran&s;lations of all the Greek tragedies, and without carrying my re|marks any farther than appertains to the poet of whom I am &s;peaking, I &s;hould feel it as an in|ju&s;tice to the merit of a very able and ingenious contemporary, if I could mention Ae&s;chylus and overlook his tran&s;lator: A work &s;o arduous as that, which Mr. Potter has executed, might claim much more indulgence, than his perform|ance will ever &s;tand in need of; but the&s;e tran&s;la|tions, could they be executed up to the full &s;pi|rit of their originals, can never intere&s;t an Eng|li&s;h reader like his native drama: To the poet they afford a great &s;ubject for di&s;play in odes and choru&s;&s;es, and relieve him at the &s;ame time from the heavie&s;t part of his work, the labour
<PB N="213" REF="218">
of the plot; but with the reader, who cannot judge of their orche&s;tral accompaniments, they will never &s;tand in competition with the activity of the Engli&s;h drama, its warm and rapid inci|dent, tran&s;ition of &s;cene, variety of character, brevity of dialogue, bu&s;y plot and dome&s;tic fable. A man of genius, who writes for the clo&s;et, may have a curio&s;ity to build a drama upon Greek con&s;truction, but he will hardly &s;ucceed in an attempt to naturalize it on our &s;tage.</P>
<P>No tran&s;lator can engage with a more difficult original than Ae&s;chylus: Time has thrown &s;ome &s;ublimities out of our &s;ight, and many difficulties in our way by the injuries of the text: The &s;tile of his tragedy be&s;peaks a fiery and inflated imagination; the time in which he wrote and his own martial habits doubtle&s;s give a colour and character to his diction; perhaps the intem|perance in which he indulged may &s;ometimes give a heat to his fancy more than natural, and there are &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, of &s;o figurative and me|taphorical a &s;ort, that I have been often tempted to &s;uppo&s;e that his campaigns again&s;t the Per|&s;ians might have tinctured his language with &s;omething of the Oriental tone of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sophocles in times more pacific has a &s;ofter ver&s;ification, and a &s;tile more &s;weet and feeble; of habits and education more effeminate, of a

<P>The tragedies of Ae&s;chylus have all the marks of an original genius; his &s;cene is ca&s;t with an awful and maje&s;tic grandeur, and he de&s;igns in the bolde&s;t &s;tile; in &s;ome &s;ituations his principal figures are painted with &s;uch terrible effect, that I can only liken them to a compo&s;ition, where Spagnolet had drawn the per&s;ons of the damned in tortures, and Salvator Ro&s;a had filled up the &s;cenery of Hell in his &s;tronge&s;t manner. No poet introduces his character on the &s;cene with

more dignity and &s;tage-effect: He is in the practice of holding the &s;pectator in &s;u&s;pen&s;e by a preparatory &s;ilence in his chief per&s;on, which is among&s;t the mo&s;t refined arts of the dramatic poet: This was well under&s;tood by our Shake|&s;pear and &s;ome others of the old &s;chool; on the French &s;tage I conceive it is very little in u&s;e.</P>
<P>In the introductory &s;cene of the <HI>Prometheus</HI> the principal character pre&s;erves a dignified &s;ilence for a con&s;iderable &s;pace of time, during which all the tremendous machinery incidental to his tortures is going forward under the &s;uper|intendance of imaginary beings, and the venge|ance of almighty Jupiter in chaining him to a rock, there to langui&s;h for innumerable ages, is in actual execution. This is a prelude infinite|ly more dramatic, &s;ublime and affecting, than if the &s;cene had been interwoven with lamenta|tions, cries and complaints, though ever &s;o well expre&s;&s;ed; the picture tells its own tale and the &s;pectacle &s;peaks to the heart without the vehicle of words: It is well ob&s;erved by Mr. Potter the tran&s;lator of Ae&s;chylus, that<Q REND="inline">"there is a dignity and even &s;ublimity in this &s;ilence of Prome|theus beyond the expre&s;&s;ion of words; but as &s;oon as the in&s;truments of tyranny have left him, he bur&s;ts into a &s;train of pathetic lamen|tation,

<P>I need not be reminded that incredulity was annexed by Apollo to the predictions of Ca&s;&s;an|dra, and that the plot and cata&s;trophe would not admit of precipitation; for I mu&s;t &s;till contend that incredulity it&s;elf is a good dramatic engine, and if the chorus had not &s;tood in his way, would have been otherwi&s;e managed by the author; but I take the character of a true Greek chorus to be &s;uch, that if Apollo him&s;elf had come in per&s;on to tell them, that the earth would open and &s;wallow them up, if they did not in&s;tantly remove from the &s;pot on which they &s;tood, they would have &s;topt to moralize, or hymn an ode, in &s;trophe and anti&s;trophe, to Jupiter, or Venus, or the gods below to whom they were de&s;cend|ing, though the ground was cleaving under their feet&mdash;provided, as I before premi&s;ed, that they had the true &s;pirit of a Greek chorus in them.

<P>The number of the chorus being limited by public edict after the exhibition of this tragedy, it is clear that the tragedy of the <HI>Supplicants</HI> mu&s;t have been &s;ub&s;equent to it, ina&s;much as the chorus of Danaides con&s;i&s;ted of fifty per&s;ons; and as the whole tenor of this &s;oft and pathetic drama bears an air of atonement to the &s;uper|&s;tition of the vulgar, and is full of pious &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to the will of Jupiter and religious venera|tion for the gods, it &s;eems to me very probable that the poet had a view in this tragedy of the <HI>Supplicants,</HI> of reconciling the people after the offence he had given them on a former occa&s;ion by making too free with the deities, and for which he narrowly e&s;caped their re&s;entment.</P>
<P>As to the tragedy of <HI>The Seven Chiefs again&s;t Thebes,</HI> it is &s;aid to have been the favourite of its author, and we know it has the te&s;timony of the critic Longinus.

<P>THERE are two very &s;triking characters delineated by our great dramatic poet, which I am de&s;irous of bringing together under one review, and the&s;e are <HI>Macbeth</HI> and <HI>Richard the Third.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="231">The parts, which the&s;e two per&s;ons &s;u&s;tain in their re&s;pective dramas, have a remarkable co|incidence: Both are actuated by the &s;ame guilty ambition in the opening of the &s;tory; both mur|der their lawful &s;overeign in the cour&s;e of it; and both are defeated and &s;lain in battle at the conclu&s;ion of it: Yet the&s;e two characters, under circum&s;tances &s;o &s;imilar, are as &s;trongly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed in every pa&s;&s;age of their dramatic life by the art of the poet, as any two men ever were by the hand of nature.</P>
<P>Let us contemplate them in the three follow|ing periods; viz. The premeditation of their crime; the perpetration of it; and the cata|&s;trophe of their death.</P>
<P>Duncan the reigning king of Scotland has two &s;ons: Edward the fourth of England has al&s;o two &s;ons; but the&s;e kings and their re&s;pective heirs do not affect the u&s;urpers Macbeth and Richard in the &s;ame degree, for the latter is a prince of the blood royal, brother to the king and next in con&s;anguinity to the throne after the death of his elder brother the duke of Clarence: Macbeth on the contrary is not in the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion&mdash;
<Q><SP>
<L>And to be king</L>
<L>Stands not within the pro&s;pect of belief.</L>
</SP></Q>
<PB N="227" REF="232">
His views therefore being further removed and more out of hope, a greater weight of cir|cum&s;tances &s;hould be thrown together to tempt and encourage him to an undertaking &s;o much beyond <HI>the pro&s;pect of his belief.</HI> The art of the poet furni&s;hes the&s;e circum&s;tances, and the en|gine, which his invention employs, is of a pre|ternatural and prodigious &s;ort. He introduces in the very opening of his &s;cene a troop of &s;ybills or witches, who &s;alute Macbeth with their divinations, and in three &s;olemn prophetic gra|tulations hail him <HI>Thane of Glamis, Thane of Cawdor,</HI> and <HI>King hereafter!</HI><Q><SP>
<L>By Sinel's death I know I'm thane of Glamis;</L>
<L>But how of Cawdor?</L>
</SP></Q> One part of the prophecy therefore is true; the remaining promi&s;es become more de&s;erving of belief. This is one &s;tep in the ladder of his ambition, and mark how artfully the poet has laid it in his way: No time is lo&s;t; the won|derful machinery is not &s;uffered to &s;tand &s;till, for behold a verification of the &s;econd prediction, and a courtier thus addre&s;&s;es him from the king&mdash;
<Q><SP>
<L>And for an earne&s;t of a greater honour,</L>
<L>He bade me from him call thee <HI>Thane of Cawdor.</HI></L>
</SP></Q>
<PB N="228" REF="233">
The magic now works to his heart, and he cannot wait the departure of the royal me&s;&s;enger before his admiration vents it&s;elf a&s;ide&mdash;
<Q><SP>
<L>Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!</L>
<L>The greate&s;t is behind.</L>
</SP></Q>
A &s;econd time he turns a&s;ide, and unable to repre&s;s the emotions, which this &s;econd con|firmation of the predictions has excited, repeats the &s;ame &s;ecret ob&s;ervation&mdash;
<Q><SP>
<L>Two truths are told</L>
<L>As happy prologues to the &s;welling act</L>
<L>Of the imperial theme.</L>
</SP></Q>
A &s;oliloquy then en&s;ues, in which the poet judiciou&s;ly opens enough of his character to &s;hew the &s;pectator that the&s;e praeternatural agents are not &s;uperfluou&s;ly &s;et to work upon a di&s;po&s;ition prone to evil, but one that will have to combat many compunctious &s;truggles before it can be brought to yield even to oracular in|fluence. This alone would demon&s;trate (if we needed demon&s;tration) that Shake&s;pear, without re&s;orting to the antients, had the judgment of ages as it were in&s;tinctively. From this in&s;tant we are appri&s;ed that Macbeth meditates an at|tack upon our pity as well as upon our horror, when he puts the following que&s;tion to his con|&s;cience&mdash;

<P>Now let us turn to <HI>Richard,</HI> in who&s;e cruel heart no &s;uch remor&s;e finds place; he needs no tempter: There is here no <HI>dignus vindice nodus,</HI> nor indeed any <HI>knot</HI> at all, for he is already prac|ti&s;ed in murder: Ambition is his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, and a crown is in view, and he tells you at his very fir&s;t entrance on the &s;cene&mdash;

The barriers of con&s;cience are broken down, and the &s;oul, hardened again&s;t &s;hame, avows its own depravity&mdash;
<Q><SP>

his brother Clarence with all the unfeeling tranquillity of a Nero or Caligula. Richard, having no longer any &s;cruples to manage with his own con&s;cience, is exactly in the predica|ment, which the dramatic poet <HI>Diphilus</HI> has de|&s;cribed with &s;uch beautiful &s;implicity of ex|pre&s;&s;ion&mdash;

of ambition at bay, affords the noble&s;t theme for the drama, and puts the creative fancy of our poet upon a re&s;ource, in which he has been rivalled only by the great father of tragedy Ae&s;chylus in the prophetic effu&s;ions of Ca&s;&s;andra, the incantations of the Per&s;ian Magi for rai&s;ing the gho&s;t of Darius, and the imaginary terrific forms of his furies; with all which our country|man probably had no acquaintance, or at mo&s;t a very ob&s;cure one.</P>
<P>When I &s;ee the names of the&s;e two great luminaries of the dramatic &s;phere, &s;o di&s;tant in time but &s;o nearly allied in genius, ca&s;ually brought in contact by the nature of my &s;ubject, I cannot help pau&s;ing for a while in this place to indulge &s;o intere&s;ting a contemplation, in which I find my mind balanced between two objects, that &s;eem to have equal claims upon me for my admiration. Ae&s;chylus is ju&s;tly &s;tiled the father of tragedy, but this is not to be inter|preted as if he was the inventor of it: Shake|&s;pear with equal ju&s;tice claims the &s;ame title, and his originality is qualified with the &s;ame exception: The Greek tragedy was not more rude and undige&s;ted when Ae&s;chylus brought it into &s;hape, than the Engli&s;h tragedy was when Shake&s;pear began to write: If therefore it be granted that he had no aids from the Greek
<PB N="232" REF="237">
theatre (and I think this is not likely to be di&s;|puted) &s;o far the&s;e great ma&s;ters are upon equal ground. Ae&s;chylus was a warrior of high re|pute, of a lofty generous &s;pirit, and deep as it &s;hould &s;eem in the erudition of his times: In all the&s;e particulars he has great advantage over our countryman, who was humbly born, of the mo&s;t menial occupation, and, as it is generally thought, unlearned. Ae&s;chylus had the whole epic of Homer in his hands, the Iliad, Ody&s;&s;ey, and that prolific &s;ource of dramatic fable, the Ilias Mi|nor; he had al&s;o a great fabulous creation to re&s;ort to among&s;t his own divinities, characters ready defined, and an audience, who&s;e &s;uper&s;ti|tion was prepared for every thing he could offer; he had therefore a firmer and broader &s;tage, (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) under his feet, than Shake&s;pear had: His fables in general are Homeric, and yet it does not follow that we can pronounce for Shake&s;pear that he is more ori|ginal in his plots, for I under&s;tand that late re|&s;earches have traced him in all, or nearly all: Both poets added &s;o much machinery and in|vention of their own in the conduct of their fables, that whatever might have been the &s;ource, &s;till their &s;treams had little or no ta&s;te of the &s;pring they flowed from. In point of character we have better grounds to decide, and yet it is
<PB N="233" REF="238">
but ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve that it is not fair to bring a mangled poet in compari&s;on with one who is entire: In his divine per&s;onages Ae&s;chylus has the field of heaven, and indeed of hell al&s;o, to him&s;elf; in his heroic and military characters he has never been excelled; he had too good a model within his own bo&s;om to fail of making tho&s;e delineations natural: In his imaginary beings al&s;o he will be found a re&s;pectable, though not an equal, rival of our poet; but in the va|riety of character, in all the nicer touches of na|ture, in all the extravagancies of caprice and humour, from the bolde&s;t feature down to the minute&s;t foible, Shake&s;pear &s;tands alone; &s;uch per&s;ons as he delineates never came into the contemplation of Ae&s;chylus as a poet; his tra|gedy has no dealing with them; the &s;implicity of the Greek fable, and the great portion of the drama filled up by the chorus, allow of little va|riety of character, and the mo&s;t which can be &s;aid of Ae&s;chylus in this particular is, that he never offends again&s;t nature or propriety, whether his ca&s;t is in the terrible or pathetic, the elevated or the &s;imple. His ver&s;ification with the inter|mixture of lyric compo&s;ition is more various than that of Shake&s;pear; both are lofty and &s;ublime in the extreme, abundantly metaphorical and &s;ometimes extravagant:&mdash;
<Q><PB N="234" REF="239"><L>&mdash;Nubes et inania captat.</L></Q>
This may be &s;aid of each poet in his turn; in each the critic, if he is in &s;earch for defects, will readily enough di&s;cover&mdash;

Both were &s;ubject to be hurried on by an uncontroulable impul&s;e, nor could nature alone &s;uffice for either: Ae&s;chylus had an apt creation of imaginary beings at command&mdash;

and they <HI>would come</HI>&mdash;Shake&s;pear, having no &s;uch creation in re&s;ource, boldly made one of his own; if Ae&s;chylus therefore was invincible, he owed it to his armour, and that, like the ar|mour of Aeneas, was the work of the gods; but the una&s;&s;i&s;ted invention of Shake&s;pear &s;eized all and more than &s;uper&s;tition &s;upplied to Ae&s;chy|lus.</P>

<P>The part which Lady Macbeth fills in the drama has a relative as well as po&s;itive im|portance, and &s;erves to place the repugnance of Macbeth in the &s;tronge&s;t point of view; &s;he is in fact the auxiliary of the witches, and the na|tural influence, which &s;o high and predominant a &s;pirit a&s;&s;erts over the tamer qualities of her hu&s;band, makes tho&s;e witches but &s;econdary agents for bringing about the main action of the drama. This is well worth a remark; for if they, which are only artificial and fanta&s;tic in|&s;truments, had been made the &s;ole or even prin|cipal movers of the great incident of the murder, nature would have been excluded from her &s;hare in the drama, and Macbeth would have become the mere machine of an uncontroulable nece&s;|&s;ity, and his character, being robbed of its free agency, would have left no moral behind: I mu&s;t take leave therefore to anticipate a remark, which I &s;hall hereafter repeat, that when Lady Macbeth is urging her Lord to the murder, not a word is dropt by either of the witches or their predic|tions. It is in the&s;e in&s;tances of his conduct that Shake&s;pear is &s;o wonderful a &s;tudy for the dramatic poet. But I proceed&mdash;</P>

He convenes the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and in a conference of &s;ome length works round to his point, by in|&s;inuations calculated to per&s;uade them to di&s;|patch Banquo for injuries done to them, rather than from motives which re&s;pect him&s;elf; in which &s;cene we di&s;cover a remarkable pre&s;erva|tion of character in Macbeth, who by this arti|fice &s;trives to blind his own con&s;cience and throw the guilt upon theirs: In this as in the former action there is nothing kingly in his cru|elty; in one he acted under the controuling &s;pirit of his wife, here he plays the &s;ycophant with hired a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf under awe of the &s;uperior genius of Banquo&mdash;

The critic of language will ob&s;erve that here is a redundancy and crowd of metaphors, but the critic of nature will acknowledge that it is the very truth of character, and join me in the remark which points it out.</P>
<P>In a tragedy &s;o replete with murder, and in the di&s;play of a character &s;o tortured by <HI>the &s;cor|pions of the mind,</HI> as this of Macbeth, it is natu|rally to be expected that a genius like Shake|&s;pear's will call in the dead for their &s;hare in the horror of the &s;cene. This he has done in two &s;everal ways; fir&s;t, by the apparition of Banquo, which is invi&s;ible to all but Macbeth; &s;econdly, by the &s;pells and incantations of the witches, who rai&s;e &s;pirits, which in certain aenigmatical predictions &s;hadow out his fate; and the&s;e are followed by a train of unborn revelations, drawn by the power of magic from the womb of futu|rity before their time.</P>
<P>It appears that Lady Macbeth was not a party
<PB N="252" REF="257">
in the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of Banquo, and the gho&s;t, though twice vi&s;ible to the murderer, is not &s;een by her. This is another incident highly worthy a particular remark; for by keeping her free from any participation in the horror of the &s;ight, the poet is enabled to make a &s;cene a&s;ide between Macbeth and her, which contains &s;ome of the fine&s;t &s;peakings in the play. The gho&s;t in Hamlet, and the gho&s;t of Darius in Ae&s;chylus are introduced by preparation and prelude, this of Banquo is an object of &s;urprize as well as terror, and there is &s;carce an incident to be named of more &s;triking and dramatic effect: it is one among&s;t various proofs, that mu&s;t con|vince every man, who looks critically into Shake|&s;pear, that he was as great a ma&s;ter in art as in nature: How it &s;trikes me in this point of view I &s;hall take the liberty of explaining more at length.</P>
<P>The murder of Duncan is the main incident of this tragedy; that of Banquo is &s;ubordinate: Duncan's blood was not only the fir&s;t &s;o &s;hed by Macbeth, but the dignity of the per&s;on murdered, and the aggravating circum&s;tances attending it, con&s;titute a crime of the very fir&s;t magnitude: For the&s;e rea&s;ons it might be ex|pected that the &s;pectre mo&s;t likely to haunt his imagination, would be that of Duncan; and the
<PB N="253" REF="258">
rather becau&s;e his terror and compunction were &s;o much more &s;trongly excited by this fir&s;t mur|der, perpe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ated with his own hands, than by the &s;ub&s;equent one of Banquo, palliated by eva&s;ion and committed to others. But when we re|collect that Lady Macbeth was not only his ac|complice, but in fact the fir&s;t mover in the mur|der of the king, we &s;ee good rea&s;on why Dun|can's gho&s;t could not be called up, unle&s;s &s;he, who &s;o deeply partook of the guilt, had al&s;o &s;hared in the horror of the appearance; and as vi&s;itations of a peculiar &s;ort were re&s;erved for her in a later period of the drama, it was a point of con&s;ummate art and judgment to exclude her from the affair of Banquo's murder, and make the more &s;u&s;ceptible con&s;cience of Macbeth figure this apparition in his mind's eye without any other witne&s;s to the vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>I per&s;uade my&s;elf the&s;e will appear very na|tural rea&s;ons, why the poet did not rai&s;e the gho&s;t of the king in preference, though it is rea|&s;onable to think it would have been a much more noble incident in his hands, than this of Banquo. It now remains to examine whether this is more fully ju&s;tified by the peculiar &s;itua|tion re&s;erved for Lady Macbeth, to which I have before adverted.</P>
<P>The intrepidity of her character is &s;o marked,
<PB N="254" REF="259">
that we may well &s;uppo&s;e no waking terrors could &s;hake it, and in this light it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged a very natural expedient to make her vent the agonies of her con&s;cience in &s;leep. Dreams have been a dramatic expedient ever &s;ince there has been a drama; Ae&s;chylus recites the dream of Clytemne&s;tra immediately before her &s;on Ore&s;tes kills her; &s;he fancies &s;he has given birth to a dragon&mdash;
<Q><SP>
<L>This new-born dragon, like an infant child,</L>

<L>And in her dream &s;he held it to her brea&s;t:</L>
<L>The milk he drew was mixt with clotted blood.</L>
</SP>
<BIBL>(POTTER.)</BIBL></Q>
This which is done by Ae&s;chylus, has been done by hundreds after him; but to introduce upon the &s;cene the very per&s;on, walking in &s;leep, and giving vent to the horrid fancies, that haunt her dream, in broken &s;peeches expre&s;&s;ive of her guilt, uttered before witne&s;&s;es, and accompanied with that natural and expre&s;&s;ive action of wa&s;h|ing the blood from her defiled hands, was re|&s;erved for the original and bold genius of Shake|&s;pear only. It is an incident &s;o full of tragic horror, &s;o daring and at the &s;ame time &s;o truly characteri&s;tic, that it &s;tands out as a prominent feature in the mo&s;t &s;ublime drama in the world,
<PB N="255" REF="260">
and fully compen&s;ates for any &s;acrifices the poet might have made in the previous arrangement of his incidents.</P>

<P>Let us now approach the tent of <HI>Richard:</HI> It is matter of admiration to ob&s;erve how many incidents the poet has collected in a &s;mall com|pa&s;s, to &s;et the military character of his chief per&s;onage in a brilliant point of view. A &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of &s;couts and me&s;&s;engers report a variety of intelligence, all which, though generally of the mo&s;t alarming nature, he meets not only with his natural gallantry, but &s;ometimes with plea&s;antry and a certain archne&s;s and repartee, which is peculiar to him throughout the drama.</P>
<P>It is not only a curious, but delightful ta&s;k to examine by what &s;ubtle and almo&s;t impercep|tible touches Shake&s;pear contrives to &s;et &s;uch marks upon his characters, as give them the
<PB N="260" REF="265">
mo&s;t living likene&s;&s;es that can be conceived. In this, above all other poets that ever exi&s;ted, he is a &s;tudy and a model of perfection: The great di&s;tingui&s;hing pa&s;&s;ions every poet may de&s;cribe; but Shake&s;pear gives you their humours, their minute&s;t foibles, tho&s;e little &s;tarts and caprices, which nothing but the mo&s;t intimate familiarity brings to light: Other authors write characters like hi&s;torians; he like the bo&s;om friend of the per&s;on he de&s;cribes. The following extracts will furni&s;h an example of what I have been &s;aying.</P>

<SPEAKER>K. Rich.</SPEAKER>
<L>There let him &s;ink, and be the &s;eas on him!</L>
<L>White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?</L>
</SP></Q>
This reply is pointed with irony and invective: There are two cau&s;es in nature and character for this; fir&s;t, Richard was before informed of the news; his pa&s;&s;ion was not taken by &s;urprize, and he was enough at ea&s;e to make a play upon Stanley's words&mdash;<HI>on the &s;eas</HI>&mdash;and retort&mdash;<HI>be the &s;eas on him!</HI>&mdash;Secondly, Stanley was a &s;u&s;pected &s;ubject, Richard was therefore intere&s;ted to &s;hew a contempt of his competitor before a man of &s;uch doubtful allegiance. In the &s;pirit of this impre&s;&s;ion he urges Stanley to give an explicit
<PB N="262" REF="267">
an&s;wer to the que&s;tion&mdash;<HI>What doth he there?</HI> Stanley endeavours to evade by an&s;wering that he <HI>knows not but by gue&s;s:</HI> The eva&s;ion only &s;trengthens Richard's &s;u&s;picions, and he again pu&s;hes him to di&s;clo&s;e what he only gue&s;&s;es&mdash;<HI>Well, as you gue&s;s</HI>&mdash;Stanley replies&mdash;

<SPEAKER>K. Rich.</SPEAKER>
<L>Is the chair empty? Is the &s;word un&s;way'd?</L>

<L>And who is England's king but great York's heir?</L>
<L>Then tell me what makes he upon the &s;ea?</L>
</SP></Q>
What a clu&s;ter of characteri&s;tic excellencies are here before us? All the&s;e interrogatories are <HI>ad hominem</HI>; they fit no man but Stanley, they can be uttered by no man but Richard, and they can flow from the conceptions of no poet but the poet of nature.</P>
<P>Stanley's whole &s;cene ought to be inve&s;ti|gated, for it is full of beauties, but I confe&s;s my&s;elf exhau&s;ted with the ta&s;k, and language does not &s;uffice to furni&s;h fre&s;h terms of ad|miration, which a clo&s;er &s;crutiny would call forth.</P>
<P>Other me&s;&s;engers &s;ucceed Lord Stanley, Richard's fiery impatience does not wait the telling, but taking the out&s;et of the account to
<PB N="263" REF="268">
be ominous, he &s;trikes the courier, who pro|ceeding with his report concludes with the good tidings of Buckingham's di&s;per&s;ion&mdash;Richard in|&s;tantly retracts and &s;ays&mdash;
<Q><SP>
<L>Oh! I cry thee mercy.</L>
<L>There is my pur&s;e to cure that blow of thine.</L>
</SP></Q>
This is another trait of the &s;ame ca&s;t with that of <HI>Good Cate&s;by.</HI></P>
<P>Battles are of the growth of modern tragedy; I am not learned enough in the old &s;tage to know if Shake&s;pear is the inventor of this bold and bu&s;tling innovation; but I am &s;ure he is unrivalled in his execution of it, and this of Bo&s;worth-field is a ma&s;ter-piece. I &s;hall be le&s;s particular in my pre&s;ent de&s;cription of it, becau&s;e I may probably bring it under general review with other &s;cenes of the like &s;ort.</P>
<P>It will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that in the ca|ta&s;trophe of Richard nothing can be more glow|ing than the &s;cene, nothing more brilliant than the conduct of the chief character: He exhibits the character of a perfect general, in whom how|ever ardent courage &s;eems the ruling feature; he performs every part of his office with minute attention, he enquires if certain alterations are made in his armour and even orders what par|ticular hor&s;e he intends to charge with: He is
<PB N="264" REF="269">
gay with his chief officers, and even gracious to &s;ome he confides in: His gallantry is of &s;o daz|zling a quality, that we begin to feel the pride of Engli&s;hmen, and, overlooking his crimes, glory in our courageous king: Richmond is one of tho&s;e civil, con&s;cientious gentlemen, who are not very apt to captivate a &s;pectator, and Richard, loaded as he is with enormities, ri&s;es in the compari&s;on, and I &s;u&s;pect carries the good wi&s;hes of many of his audience into action, and dies with their regret.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he retires to his tent the poet be|gins to put in motion his great moral machinery of the gho&s;ts. Trifles are not made for Shake|&s;pear; difficulties, that would have plunged the &s;pirit of any other poet, and turned his &s;cenery into inevitable ridicule, are nothing in his way; he brings forward a long &s;tring of gho&s;ts, and puts a &s;peech into each of their mouths without any fear of con&s;equences. Richard &s;tarts from his couch, and before he has &s;haken off the ter|rors of his dream, cries out&mdash;
<Q><SP>
<L>Give me another hor&s;e!&mdash;Bind up my wounds!&mdash;</L>
<L>Have mercy, Je&s;u!&mdash;Soft, I did but dream&mdash;</L>
<L>O coward con&s;cience&mdash;&amp;c.</L>

<P>AMONGST the various orders and ranks of men in civilized &s;ociety, &s;ome are enti|tled to our re&s;pect for the dignity and utility of their profe&s;&s;ion; but as there are many more than merely natural wants to be provided for in a &s;tate of high refinement, other arts and occu|pations will occur, which though not &s;o highly to be re&s;pected for their utility, will yet be valued and care&s;&s;ed for the plea&s;ures they be&s;tow. In this light there is perhaps no one order of men, who contribute more largely to the plea&s;ing and moral amu&s;ements of the age, than our actors. As I mean to devote this paper to their u&s;e and &s;ervice, I &s;hall begin it with a &s;hort pa&s;|&s;age extracted from Mr. Dow's Hi&s;tory of Hin|do&s;tan.</P>
<Q>During all the&s;e tran&s;actions the gates of Delhi were kept &s;hut. Famine began to rage every day more and more; but the Shaw was deaf to the mi&s;eries of mankind. The public &s;pirit of <HI>Tucki, a famous actor,</HI> de&s;erves to be
<PB N="266" REF="271">
recorded upon this occa&s;ion. He exhibited a play before Nadir Shaw, with which that mo|narch was &s;o well plea&s;ed, that he commanded Tucki to a&s;k, and what he wi&s;hed &s;hould be done for him. Tucki fell upon his face, and &s;aid, <HI>O King, command the gates to be opened, that the poor may not peri&s;h!</HI> His reque&s;t was granted, and half the city poured into the country; and the place was &s;upplied in a few days with plenty of provi&s;ions.</Q>
<P>Though it is not every actor's lot to &s;ave a city, yet it is his province to drive an enemy out of it, almo&s;t as formidable as famine.</P>
<P>There is &s;uch a combination of natural gifts requi&s;ite to the formation of a compleat actor, that it is more a ca&s;e of wonder how &s;o many good ones are to be found, than why &s;o few in|&s;tances of excellence can be produced. Every thing, that re&s;ults from nature alone, lies out of the province of in&s;truction, and no rules that I know of will &s;erve to give a fine form, a fine voice, or even tho&s;e fine feelings, which are among&s;t the fir&s;t properties of an actor. The&s;e in fact are the tools and materials of his trade, and the&s;e neither his own indu&s;try, nor any man's a&s;&s;i&s;tance can be&s;tow. But the right u&s;e and application of them is another que&s;tion, and there
<PB N="267" REF="272">
he mu&s;t look for his directions from education, indu&s;try and judgment.</P>
<P>A cla&s;&s;ical education, if it be not in&s;i&s;ted on as indi&s;pen&s;able to a great actor, is yet &s;o advan|tageous to him in every branch of his art, that it is a mo&s;t happy circum&s;tance in their lot, who can avail them&s;elves of it.</P>
<P>Be this as it may, it behoves him in the very fir&s;t place to be thoroughly ver&s;ed in all the chief dramatic writers of his own country. Of all the&s;e Shake&s;pear is &s;o out of &s;ight the principal, that for di&s;tinction &s;ake I will confine my&s;elf to him only. This author therefore mu&s;t be &s;tudied in the mo&s;t critical and &s;crutinizing manner; not by parts, but in whole; for it is the verie&s;t folly in any young &s;tudent for the &s;tage to read by <HI>character,</HI> or attach him&s;elf to any one pre|dominant part, in which he aims at a di&s;play, until he has po&s;&s;e&s;t him&s;elf in the compleate&s;t manner of the whole drama, in which he is to &s;tand. Every movement of the author's mind &s;hould be unravelled, all tho&s;e &s;mall but delicate incidents, which &s;erve to announce or di&s;crimi|nate a leading character, every thing &s;aid to him, or of him, as well as by him, are to be carefully gathered up; for Shake&s;pear in particular paints &s;o very clo&s;e to nature, and with &s;uch marking
<PB N="268" REF="273">
touches, that he gives the very look an actor ought to wear, when he is on his &s;cene.</P>
<P>When an actor has done this, he will find his under&s;tanding &s;o enlightened by the ta&s;k, and his mind po&s;&s;e&s;t with &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion for what is na|tural, that he will &s;corn the &s;orry practice of tricks, and that vain &s;tudy of &s;etting him&s;elf off by this or that preconcerted attitude, in which &s;ome handicraft-men, who were more like tum|blers than tragedians, have in times pa&s;t di&s;|graced their profe&s;&s;ion: In &s;hort, if he &s;tudies his author he will have no need to &s;tudy his looking-gla&s;s: Let him feel and he will be &s;ure to expre&s;s; Nature, that gave him limbs and organs of &s;peech, will be &s;ure to give him action, and he need not mea&s;ure the board he is to fall upon, as if he was to make his exit down a trap.</P>
<P>There is one thing in particular I would wi&s;h him to avoid, which is a repugnance again&s;t ap|pearing in characters of an unamiable &s;ort; (the ladies will ob&s;erve I addre&s;s my&s;elf to both &s;exes throughout:) It is a narrow notion to &s;uppo&s;e that there can be any adhe&s;ion either of vice or virtue to the real character; or that revenge, cruelty, perfidiou&s;ne&s;s or cowardice can be tran&s;|po&s;ed into a man's nature, becau&s;e he profe&s;|&s;ionally repre&s;ents the&s;e evil qualities. If I had
<PB N="269" REF="274">
not determined again&s;t particularizing any per|&s;on in this paper, I &s;hould here quote the exam|ple of an actor, who&s;e untimely death every friend of the drama mu&s;t deplore, and who&s;e good &s;en&s;e I might appeal to in confirmation of my advice.</P>
<P>Of this above all things every actor may a&s;|&s;ure him&s;elf, that there is no calling or profe&s;&s;ion in life, that can le&s;s endure the di&s;tractions of intemperance and di&s;&s;ipation. A knowledge of the world no doubt is nece&s;&s;ary to him, and he mu&s;t therefore take his &s;hare in &s;ociety, but there is no other introduction into the be&s;t company, but by meriting a place in it; and as for vulgar fellow&s;hips and connections, where a man is to act the <HI>plea&s;ant fellow</HI> and &s;et the table in a roar, if he has not the &s;pirit and di&s;cretion to decline them, he will &s;oon find his profe&s;&s;ional talents &s;acrificed to his convivial ones; if he does not re&s;erve all his exertions for his art, nature mu&s;t &s;ink under double duty, and the mo&s;t that he can obtain in return will be pity.</P>
<P>An eminent actor &s;hould re&s;olve to fortify him&s;elf again&s;t the many per&s;onal attacks, which in the pre&s;ent times he is to expect from friends as well as foes: by the former I mean tho&s;e friends, who&s;e ill-judged applau&s;es are as dan|gerous to his repo&s;e as calumny it&s;elf. That
<PB N="270" REF="275">
proper &s;en&s;e of him&s;elf, which holds a middle place between diffidence and arrogance, is what he mu&s;t oppo&s;e to the&s;e attacks of extravagant applau&s;e or illiberal defamation; for gentlemen of wit and plea&s;antry find &s;o much amu&s;ement in &s;porting with the feelings of actors, that they will write; and there is a figure called <HI>hyperbole</HI> much in fa&s;hion among&s;t them, the excellent property of which figure is that it cuts both ways&mdash;<HI>virtus ejus ex diver&s;o par augendi atque minuendi</HI>&mdash;Now although the <HI>hyperbole</HI> is a figure of freedom, and has certain privileges, that go beyond credibility, yet I have the authority of <HI>Quintilian</HI> to &s;ay that it has bounds; on the out|&s;ide of truth, I confe&s;s, but &s;till within rea&s;on&mdash;<HI>Quam vis enim e&s;t omnis hyperbole ultra fidem; non tamen e&s;&s;e debet ultra modum.</HI>&mdash;An actor therefore will do wi&s;ely to put no faith in &s;uch a double-tongued figure, nor form any ac|quaintance with tho&s;e who are in the daily u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>If he would have better authority for the ad|vice I give him, let him turn to his books, and he will not find a writer of eminence, either an|tient or modern, that will not tell him &s;lander is a tax on merit. I &s;hall in&s;tance only one of each, becau&s;e I will not burthen him with quo|tations. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is <HI>Tacitus,</HI> a writer
<PB N="271" REF="276">
of unque&s;tionable authority, and one who has left as good receipts for whole&s;ome judgment in all worldly affairs as any man whatever: His maxim indeed is &s;hort, for he makes no wa&s;te of words on any occa&s;ion; &s;peaking of certain li|bellous publications, he ob&s;erves&mdash;<HI>Spreta exo|le&s;cunt; &s;i ira&s;care, agnita videntur:</HI>&mdash;Which may be thus rendered&mdash;<HI>Contempt di&s;arms abu&s;e; re&s;ent, and you adopt it.</HI>&mdash;The other which I &s;hall adduce, is the judicious and amiable Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> who is rather more diffu&s;ive on the &s;ubject, but con|cludes his opinion with this recommendation of the pre&s;cription above mentioned&mdash;<HI>That it is a piece of fortitude, which every man owes to his own innocence, and without which it is impo&s;&s;ible for a man of any merit or figure to live at peace with him&s;elf, in a country that abounds with wit and liberty.</HI> (<HI>Spect.</HI> N^o 355.)</P>
<P>When I have &s;aid this, I am free to own, that it is an act of aggravated cruelty to attack a man, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion lays him &s;o continually at mercy, and who has fewer defences than other men to re&s;ort to. An actor has a claim upon the public for their protection, who&s;e &s;ervant he is; and he ought to be dear to every man in particular, who&s;e heart he has dilated with bene|volence, or lightened with fe&s;tivity; if we are grateful to the &s;urgeon who a&s;&s;uages the pain of
<PB N="272" REF="277">
a fe&s;tering &s;ore, or draws even a thorn from our fle&s;h, &s;hould we not remember him with kind|ne&s;s, who heals our heart of its inquietude, and chears tho&s;e hours with gaiety and innocence, which we might el&s;e have devoted to gloomine&s;s or guilt?</P>
<P>If an actor has the&s;e claims upon the world at large, what ought he not to expect from the poet in particular? The poet's arms &s;hould be his natural a&s;ylum, a &s;hield from the arrows of envy and detraction. An actor is in the capa|city of a &s;teward to every living mu&s;e, and of an executor to every departed one: The poet digs up the ore; he &s;ifts it from the dro&s;s, refines and purifies it for the mint; the actor &s;ets the &s;tamp upon it, and makes it current in the world.</P>

<P>THERE is no period of antient hi&s;tory would afford a more u&s;eful &s;tudy to a young prince, than an accurate delineation of the whole life of Tiberius: This ought to be done with great care and ability, for it is a
<PB N="273" REF="278">
character extremely difficult to develope, and one that by a continued chain of incidents fur|ni&s;hes a le&s;&s;on in every link of its connexion highly intere&s;ting to all pupils, but mo&s;t to tho&s;e who are on the road to empire. To trace the conduct of Tiberius from his fir&s;t appearance in hi&s;tory to his death, is as if we &s;hould begin with the la&s;t acts of Augu&s;tus and read his &s;tory backwards to its commencement in the civil wars; each narration would then begin with honour and conclude with infamy. If Augu&s;tus had never attained to empire, he would have had a mo&s;t di&s;graceful page in hi&s;tory; on the other hand, had Tiberius died with Germanicus, he would have merited a very glorious one: It &s;hould &s;eem therefore that he was by nature a better man than his predece&s;&s;or. The cautious timid character of Augu&s;tus kept him under con&s;tant awe of tho&s;e he governed, and he was diligent to &s;ecure to him&s;elf the opinions of mankind; but there are rents and fi&s;&s;ures enough in the veil, which adulation has thrown over him, through which to &s;py out the impurities and meanne&s;&s;es of his natural di&s;po&s;ition. Tibe|rius &s;eems on his part al&s;o to have had a jealous holding and re&s;pect towards Germanicus, which had an influence over the early part of his reign; but it was a &s;elf-re&s;traint, founded in emulation,
<PB N="274" REF="279">
not in fear. It is hinted that Augu&s;tus had in mind to re&s;tore the commonwealth, and give back her liberties to Rome; and the&s;e may very po&s;&s;ibly have been his meditations; but they never aro&s;e in his mind till he found his life in the la&s;t &s;tage of decay, when, having no heir of his own body, he would willingly have had the empire cea&s;e with him, and left po&s;terity to draw the conclu&s;ion, that no &s;ucce&s;&s;or could be found fit to take it after him; this I can readily be|lieve he would have done in his la&s;t moments, if he could, and even before his la&s;t moments if he dared; but the &s;hock, which &s;uch a re&s;olution might po&s;&s;ibly have occa&s;ioned, alarmed his fears, and he was too tenacious of power to quit it upon any other motives than tho&s;e of ab&s;olute conviction that he could hold it no longer. This is &s;o much in character, that I think it very pro|bable he might have tried it upon Tiberius in his long death-bed conver&s;ation with him at Nola&mdash;<HI>Revocatum ex itinere Tiberium diu &s;ecret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ermone detinuit, neque po&s;t ulli majori negotio animum accommodavit.</HI> (<HI>Suetonius.</HI>) This pa&s;&s;age is very curious, and &s;ome important conjectures may fairly be grounded upon it. Suetonius &s;ays that the conference was <HI>long,</HI> and al&s;o that it was <HI>private</HI>; and he adds that Augu&s;tus, after his conver&s;ation with his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, never turned his
<PB N="275" REF="280">
thoughts to any important bu&s;ine&s;s, or in other words, any matter of &s;tate whatever. The <HI>&s;e|crecy</HI> of this conference very much favours my conjecture, that he made an attempt to di&s;&s;uade Tiberius from holding on the empire, and the <HI>length</HI> of time it took up corroborates the pro|bability of that conjecture; and I further incline to think it likely that it might make &s;erious im|pre&s;&s;ions on Tiberius's mind, as to the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed; for I can never believe that the re|pugnance, with which Tiberius took the charge of the government upon him, was wholly feigned, though hi&s;torians agree in giving it that turn; his long and voluntary exile in the i&s;land of Rhodes, where he &s;eemed for a time to have renounced all de&s;ire of &s;ucceeding to the empire, might be a rea&s;on with Augu&s;tus for making this experiment upon a man of his cold and &s;e|que&s;tered habits. At all events I think it high|ly natural to &s;uppo&s;e that Augu&s;tus would not have clo&s;etted him in this manner, if it were only for the purpo&s;e of giving him le&s;&s;ons and in&s;tructions in the arts of government; for in that ca&s;e his vanity, which made him act a part for applau&s;e even in his expiring moments, would have opened his doors to his family and attendants, that they might have been pre&s;ent to record his &s;ayings; and we &s;hould have had as
<PB N="276" REF="281">
many fine maxims in his dying &s;peech, as So|crates uttered in his pri&s;on, or Seneca in his bath: Add to this, that he certainly bore no good-will to Tiberius, who was not a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his mind, nor could he wi&s;h to elevate the Claudian family to the throne: It is not likely however that he altogether &s;ucceeded with Ti|berius, or brought him to make any ab&s;olute promi&s;e of abdication; for in that ca&s;e he would not have failed to have taken credit with the people about him, for having been the means of re&s;toring the liberties of his country, and he would have made as great a parade of patrioti&s;m, as would have become a Cato or a Solon; but the author above quoted &s;ays he took no further account of public bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore we may conclude the conference, if it took that turn, did not come to any &s;atisfactory conclu&s;ion on the point.</P>
<P>Tiberius on his acce&s;&s;ion found the empire in a critical &s;ituation, for be&s;ides the movements which Clemens on one part and Scribonius Libo on another were making, the Pannonian and German armies were in ab&s;olute revolt. This was no time for making any change in the con|&s;titution of the imperial power, had he been &s;o di&s;po&s;ed; as he was a man of deep mea&s;ures, he held him&s;elf on the re&s;erve with the &s;enate, and
<PB N="277" REF="282">
&s;ueffred them to &s;olicit his acceptance of the &s;o|vereign power upon their knees: He wi&s;hed to have a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors in the government; he would take his &s;hare, and whatever department in the &s;tate they &s;hould recommend to his charge, he would readily undertake. Had he per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing the empire, or had he attempted to throw the con&s;titution back to its fir&s;t principles of freedom, the mutinous legions would have forced the &s;overeignty upon Germanicus; but by this &s;ugge&s;tion of a partition he artfully &s;ounded the temper of the &s;enate, where there were &s;ome leading men of very doubtful cha|racters, whom Augu&s;tus had marked out in his la&s;t illne&s;s; from two of the&s;e, A&s;inius Gal|lus and L. Aruntius, Tiberius's propo&s;al drew an an&s;wer, in which they demanded of him to declare what particular department of the &s;tate he would chu&s;e to have committed to him. This was opening enough for one of his pene|tration, and he drew his conclu&s;ions upon the &s;pot, evading for the time the &s;nare that was laid for him.</P>
<P>The &s;ervile and exce&s;&s;ive adulation of the &s;e|nate &s;oon convinced him, that the Roman &s;pirit had &s;uffered a total change under the reign of Augu&s;tus, and that the &s;tate might indeed be thrown into convul&s;ions by any attempt at a
<PB N="278" REF="283">
change in favour of freedom, but that &s;lavery and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion under a de&s;potic ma&s;ter was their determined choice, and if the alternative was to lie between him&s;elf and any other there was little room for he&s;itation: Who more fit than the adopted heir of Augu&s;tus, and a de&s;cendant of the Claudian hou&s;e, which ranked &s;o high in the Patrician nobility, and &s;o &s;uperior in preten|&s;ions of ance&s;try and merit to the Julian and Octavian gentry, from whom his predece&s;&s;ors were ignobly de&s;cended?</P>
<P>When the German and Pannonian mutinies were appea&s;ed, there &s;eems to have been a period of repo&s;e, when he might have new-modelled the con&s;titution, had he been &s;o di&s;po&s;ed; but this I take to be appearance only, for tho&s;e mu|tinies had been quelled by Germanicus and Dru&s;us, and both the&s;e princes were in the adoption; and the latter of a very turbulent and ambitious &s;pirit.</P>
<P>For the &s;pace of two compleat years Tiberius never &s;tirred out of the doors of his palace, devoting his whole time to the affairs of go|vernment. In this period he certainly did many excellent things, and though his manners were not calculated for popularity, yet his reputa|tion through the empire was univer&s;al; he regulated all dome&s;tic matters with con&s;ummate
<PB N="279" REF="284">
prudence, and on &s;ome occa&s;ions with a libe|ral and courteous &s;pirit: In the di&s;tant pro|vinces, where wars and di&s;turbances were more frequent, public mea&s;ures were more indebted for their &s;ucce&s;s to the good policy of his in|&s;tructions, than to the courage and activity of his generals, though Germanicus was of the number.</P>
<P>The death of that mo&s;t amiable and excellent prince, which was imputed to the machinations of Cneius Pi&s;o, involved Tiberius in &s;ome de|gree in the &s;ame &s;u&s;picion; but as Tacitus in his account of the event gives admi&s;&s;ion to an idle &s;tory of &s;orceries and incantations practi&s;ed by Pi&s;o for compa&s;&s;ing the death of Germanicus, and &s;tates no circum&s;tance that can give any rea&s;onable ground for belief that he actually poi&s;oned him, I am not inclined to give credit to the tran&s;action, even in re&s;pect to Pi&s;o's being guilty of the murder, much le&s;s with regard to Tiberius. Tacitus indeed hints at &s;ecret orders &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to have been given by the em|peror to Pi&s;o; but this, which at be&s;t is mere matter of report, does not go to the affair of the poi&s;oning, but only to &s;ome private intima|tions, in which the empre&s;s was chief mover, for mortifying the pride of Agrippina. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, when Pi&s;o openly returned to
<PB N="280" REF="285">
Rome, and &s;tood a public trial, that the&s;e orders, had any &s;uch exi&s;ted, could have been &s;o totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, that neither the guilty per&s;on &s;hould avail him&s;elf of them, nor any one member of &s;o great and numerous a family produce them in vindication of him when yet living, or of his memory after death; and this in no period of time, not even when the Claudian family were &s;uper&s;eded in the empire, and anecdotes were indu&s;triou&s;ly collected to blacken the character of Tiberius.</P>
<P>The death of Dru&s;us followed that of Ger|manicus, and the &s;ame groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picions were levelled at the emperor; but the&s;e are rejected by Tacitus with contempt, and the words he u&s;es, which are very &s;trong, are a proper an&s;wer to both imputations&mdash;<HI>Neque qui&s;quam &s;criptor tam infen&s;us ex&s;titit, ut Tiberio objectaret, cum omniae conquirerent, intenderent|que.</HI></P>
<P>It would have been mo&s;t happy for the me|mory of Tiberius had his life been terminated at this fatal period; henceforward he &s;eems to have been &s;urrendered to de&s;peration and di&s;|gu&s;t; he retired to the Campania, and devolved the government upon his mini&s;ter Sejanus; there were times, in which &s;ome marks of his former &s;pirit appeared, but they were &s;hort and tran&s;ient
<PB N="128" REF="286">
emanations; the ba&s;e&s;t of mankind had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul, and whether he was drugged by Se|janus and his agents, or that his brain was affect|ed by a revul&s;ion of that &s;crophulous humour, which broke out with &s;uch violence in his face and body, it &s;eems highly natural to conjecture, that he was never in his &s;ound mind during his &s;ece&s;&s;ion in the i&s;land of Caprea. A number of circum&s;tances might be adduced in &s;upport of this conjecture; it is &s;ufficient to in&s;tance his extraordinary letter to the &s;enate; can words be found more expre&s;&s;ive of a di&s;tracted and de&s;pe|rate &s;tate of mind than the following?&mdash;<HI>Quid &s;cribam vobis, Patres Con&s;cripti, aut quomodo &s;cri|bam, aut qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">omnino non &s;cribam hoc tempore, Dii me deaeque pejus perdant, quam perire quotidie &s;entio, &s;i &s;cio.</HI></P>
<P>I beg leave now to repeat what I advanced in the out&s;et of this paper, and which alone led me to the &s;ubject of it, that a detail comprizing all the great and intere&s;ting events within the life of Tiberius, with rea&s;onings and remarks judiciou&s;ly inter&s;per&s;ed, as the&s;e occurrences ari&s;e in the cour&s;e of the narration, would compound &s;uch a body of u&s;eful precepts and in&s;tructions, as would apply to every &s;pecies of example, which a prince &s;hould be taught either to imi|tate
<PB N="282" REF="287">
or avoid; and the&s;e le&s;&s;ons would carry the greater force and recommendation with them, and have an advantage over all fabulous morals, by being incorporated with a real hi&s;tory of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ort.</P>
