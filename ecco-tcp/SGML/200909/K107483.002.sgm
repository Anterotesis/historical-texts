<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I AM an unhappy Young Woman, that want a little of your
<HI>Plain Dealing,</HI> and good <HI>Advice,</HI> to help me out in an Affair
of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence to my Peace. I am in too much pain, to make a
long In|troduction; therefore hope you will excu&s;e me, if I only &s;end a
&s;hort Sketch of my Misfortune, without &s;taying to pay my grateful Thanks,
for your agreeable Week|ly Entertainments; which I can never enough Admire. I
hope you won't think me trouble&s;ome, if I relate the exact Situ|ation of
Life, I at pre&s;ent am in. I live in a fine Old Seat in <HI>Surrey,</HI> which
wants nothing to render it delightful, to a Per&s;on of my Temper. Our Family
con&s;i&s;ts of my Father (who is a Widower) an old Maiden Aunt, two Si&s;ters,
and my Self. My Father is a very good Man, and em|ploys him&s;elf mo&s;tly in
his Study. My Aunt is of a re&s;erv'd Temper, therefore &s;uffers us to keep
but little Company, e&s;|pecially with Gentlemen. There is only one Per&s;on
allow'd that fatal Liberty! Who&s;e Character I mu&s;t make you acquaint|ed 
<PB N="3" REF="4"> with: But how, alas! &s;hall I do that? Yet if there is
&s;uch a Thing as Perfection in Mankind, he certainly is Ma&s;ter of it. He has
&s;o fine an Under&s;tanding in all Arts and Sciences (allow'd by his own Sex)
&s;o great a Knowledge in every thing that is Polite and Agreeable, and,
withal, &s;o &s;weet a Di&s;po&s;ition, that I only wonder, I kept my Heart
&s;o long free from his irre&s;i&s;table Charms! I have been pretty intimate
with him the&s;e Three Years, but did not know, 'till within the&s;e Three
Months, that my Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery, depended intirely up|on him. In
&s;hort, I feel &s;o violent a Pa&s;|&s;ion in my Brea&s;t, that unle&s;s I
have &s;ome &s;peedy Relief, Death will &s;oon put a Pe|riod to my Sorrow! How
often have I &s;ate contemplating his Virtues and Charms, 'till my Soul has
almo&s;t di&s;&s;olv'd away in Ten|derne&s;s and Love! I &s;igh, I die for him;
while he views me with Cold Indifference, or, at be&s;t, but Luke-warm
Friend&s;hip: Tyrant Cu&s;tom, and innate Mode&s;ty, for|bid my Tongue to utter
the Tortures of my Heart. He &s;ometimes laughs, and &s;ays, I am all Charms;
Oh! what wou'd I give to have him really think &s;o! He behaves exactly alike
to my &s;elf, and Si&s;ters, and yet I can't help being jealous, if he &s;peaks
or looks at them. I am all Madne&s;s and De|&s;pair! I han't the Vanity to
think I can ever plea&s;e a Man of his Sen&s;e and Judg|ment, and yet I go on
to love! Sometimes <PB N="4" REF="5"> I think my con&s;tant Pa&s;&s;ion will be
re|warded, and that he will like me for my good Nature, which &s;ome People
flatter me, and tell him, I have a great Share of: And as it is a Qualification
he very much admires, I &s;trive every Day, to improve it, and to command all
tho&s;e little Pa&s;&s;ions that are incident to our Sex. Was I &s;uf|fer'd to
plead for my &s;elf, I cou'd tell him, What an obedient Wife I'd make him! How
my Duty and Inclinations wou'd both concur, to plea&s;e him in all Actions of
my Life! When he was ab&s;ent, I wou'd enter|tain my &s;elf with his dear Idea!
and when he return'd, meet him with inexpre&s;&s;ible Raptures! I cou'd dwell
for ever on the in|chanting Subject: But fear I &s;hould grow tire&s;ome. This
opening of my Grief has been &s;ome Relief. I almo&s;t fear to have this
publi&s;hed: I wi&s;h, yet dread, he &s;hould di&s;cover me. I don't know what
to do: Therefore rely wholly upon your Advice. If you print it, correct the bad
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; if you burn it, Remember and Pity</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>The poor</HI> LUCINDA!</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>WHAT con&s;tant Companions are <HI>Merit</HI> and
<HI>Humility?</HI> How does this Lady conclude a Letter that mu&s;t charm
<HI>every Reader. If you print it, correct the bad Engli&s;h.</HI> It is too
good to be corrected. Sincerity, and everla&s;t|ing Tenderne&s;s &s;hine forth,
in every Sentence. That Per&s;on who does not plainly perceive, 
<PB N="5" REF="6"> that what <HI>Lucinda</HI> has written, flow'd from her
Heart, mu&s;t have his own Heart ill pla|ced, and removed out of the Way of
<HI>Nature.</HI> If Men could write thus, no Woman of Sen&s;e would be ever
courted in vain: When &s;he &s;ignifies &s;o <HI>plainly</HI> that &s;he loves
him from her Heart; how cordially does &s;he labour to make that
<HI>Plainne&s;s</HI> &s;till <HI>plainer,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, as &s;he
proceeds &s;till <HI>farther</HI> in her Letter. The&s;e plain Phra&s;es are
the Ma&s;ter-touches of <HI>Nature,</HI> and put <HI>Art</HI> out of
Countenance. This is the natural Simplicity, that makes the <HI>proud</HI>
Scholar's Ornaments look <HI>poor.</HI> Any body, that knows what Love is, will
not barely <HI>read,</HI> but <HI>feel</HI> this Lady's Letter. Old as I am, my
&s;elf, how am I warm'd, when, &s;he expre&s;&s;es her Tenderne&s;s. And, if
every <HI>unconcerned</HI> Per&s;on be her <HI>Well-wi&s;her,</HI> what
<HI>Emotions</HI> mu&s;t this Letter be able to rai&s;e in the Bo&s;om of that
happy Man, whom it <HI>concerns.</HI> Will not her Prudence, her vow'd
Obedience, her Study to plea&s;e, her Humi|lity, and being uncon&s;cious of the
greate&s;t Worth in her &s;elf; her whole Pride placed in admiring him, her
Adoration, almo&s;t, of his &s;uperior Merit; her de&s;iring, and yet
diffi|ding, to de&s;erve him: Will not all the&s;e win over his Soul to her?
Where &s;he de&s;cribes to him, how &s;he will behave in his Pre&s;ence, and
how in his Ab&s;ence; what a Figure mu&s;t &s;he make in the Imagination of
this ad|mired Man? Mu&s;t &s;he not be as much admi|red, as &s;he admires? Does
&s;he not force him <PB N="6" REF="7"> to what &s;he &s;o earne&s;tly
<HI>wi&s;hes?</HI> The God of Love lives, breathes and acts, in every Line of
it, and nothing le&s;s than THAT VERY MAN, who, as &s;he &s;ays, <HI>If there
be &s;uch a thing as Perfection in Mankind, is certainly Ma&s;ter of it,</HI>
can be a <HI>&s;uitable Prize,</HI> for her <HI>Merit.</HI></P>
<P>IT has been reported concerning the <HI>fine&s;t Orator,</HI> of
the pre&s;ent Age, that the Lady, to whom he was married, grew his
<HI>Wife,</HI> by being his <HI>Client.</HI> He had long been acquaint|ed with
her Patience, Temper and Spirit, by her Manner of &s;oliciting her own Cau&s;e:
He knew her Fortune, which depended upon it; &s;he gave him &s;uch full and
elegant In&s;tructi|ons, as few profe&s;s'd Lawyers could have Penn'd, and as
&s;carce needed his own power|ful A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Amendment. He ask'd her,
who had drawn them? and being in|formed her &s;elf had been the Compiler, it is
no wonder, that &s;o much Wit, in &s;o agree|able a Per&s;on, made that
greate&s;t of Orators, who&s;e Addre&s;&s;es no Lady could with&s;tand, from
that Moment, her Suiter, and, con&s;e|quently, her Husband.&mdash;</P>
<P>I HAVE often wi&s;h'd, to be fully &s;atisfied of the Truth of
this little beautiful Piece of Secret Hi&s;tory.&mdash;But whether it be true
in all its Circum&s;tances, it was not invented by one, who meant to malign the
Fame of that Lord, or the Merit of his Lady, &s;ince a more glorious Accident
could not well be a&s;&s;igned, to have brought about the Marri|age of &s;o
illu&s;trious a Pair.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">THE Letter, which now lies before me, is the
mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Plea that ever my Eyes beheld. I know &s;ome who
under&s;tand not what Love is, will be offended at a Woman's fir&s;t declaring
her Pa&s;&s;ion. How &s;en&s;ible is the Fair One of this, when &s;he cries
out, <HI>Tyrant Cu&s;tom and innate Mode&s;ty, forbid my Tongue to utter the
Tortures of my Heart.</HI>&mdash;By <HI>Lucinda</HI>'s Leave, &s;he
<HI>her&s;elf,</HI> is too rigid and &s;evere <HI>again&s;t her&s;elf.</HI>
Cu&s;tom, indeed, does forbid it, and a Tyrannical Cu&s;tom it is, becau&s;e,
though pretendedly grounded upon the Colours of Mode&s;ty, 'tis unju&s;t, 'tis
un|natural, and irreligious at the Bottom.&mdash;Is it not <HI>mode&s;t,</HI>
as well as <HI>natural,</HI> to have an Inclination to be honourably married?
She that has <HI>not</HI> an Inclination, <HI>before</HI> &s;he is ask'd, can
hardly, with Truth, declare <HI>Inclination</HI>: And if it was an Inclination
vertuous and honourable from the Beginning; it mu&s;t have been equally
vertuous and honourable from the Beginning to have owned it. A dull and
ob&s;tinate Concealment of the Truth, 'till it <HI>happens</HI> to be
<HI>extorted,</HI> is a <HI>Triumph</HI> given to <HI>Folly</HI> over
<HI>Nature,</HI> for the Sake of a <HI>mi&s;taken Mode&s;ty.</HI> Both Sexes,
if they will but reflect, mu&s;t <HI>agree</HI> in this
<HI>Truth.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>WHAT Batchelor of good Sen&s;e would not be overjoy'd to
di&s;cover a <HI>Lucinda,</HI> thus opening in his own Favour? The Man who
di&s;liked a Woman for declaring her Approba|tion of him, would be like one,
who &s;eck|ing for a Silver Mine, and di&s;covering by <PB N="8" REF="9">
chance, a Golden one, &s;hou'd de&s;ert it, for no other Rea&s;on, but
becau&s;e good Fortune had put it in his Way.&mdash;</P>
<P>THERE is a va&s;t deal of Delight in con|templating the Beauties
of a Woman's Mind, who could write thus delicately. How hap|py would &s;he make
her Husband? She would &s;ooth any Sorrow that could <HI>reach</HI> him, and
<HI>exalt</HI> his <HI>Plea&s;ures</HI> into <HI>Raptures</HI>; &s;he would be
his <HI>Comfort</HI> in <HI>Adver&s;ity,</HI> and <HI>gild</HI> and
<HI>adorn</HI> his <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI>; &s;he would <HI>gladden</HI> his
<HI>Youth,</HI> and <HI>cheri&s;h</HI> his <HI>Age</HI>; give more
<HI>Warmth</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> to the <HI>Summer</HI> of his <HI>Life,</HI>
and yield <HI>Gaity</HI> and <HI>Refre&s;hment</HI> to his <HI>Winter</HI>;
&s;he would give <HI>Wings</HI> to his <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> Abroad, and
<HI>divert</HI> him at Home, with her <HI>Conver&s;ation</HI>; &s;he would fill
up the <HI>Vacuities</HI> of <HI>Solitude,</HI> with Di&s;cour&s;e, that was
prefer|rable to the <HI>Company</HI> of <HI>Wits</HI>; no <HI>Nights</HI> could
be <HI>tedious</HI> by her Side; and <HI>Day-light</HI> would be made more
<HI>chearful</HI> by <HI>looking</HI> upon her.</P>
<P>BUT I draw towards a Conclu&s;ion as fa&s;t as I can, for fear of
hindring any longer, what I would &s;peedily unite. I fancy my &s;elf to be
this Minute, with my Paper, in the Parlour of that fine Old Seat in <HI>Surrey.
Lucinda</HI> and her Lover, have both hold of the <HI>Plain Dealer,</HI> who
tells them his Senti|ments like the Father of them both.&mdash;I hear him
reading, I &s;ee her wi&s;hing, and yet dreading to be di&s;covered.&mdash;I
wi&s;h the Di&s;|covery my &s;elf&mdash;Methinks I &s;ee it, and hear 
<PB N="9" REF="10"> him &s;ay&mdash;<HI>You are</HI> Lucinda; <HI>I have often
told you, You are all Charms. There wants no|thing but your Con&s;ent to make

Paper as &s;he would let it drop&mdash;Now, if I could make my Paper &s;peak,
it &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Do, drop me from between you; join Hands over a more

<P>IT is the Duty of a Patriot to mourn for tho&s;e growing Evils,
which &s;eem to threaten, either the Safety, or the Honour of his Country: And,
for this Rea&s;on, I have often been, irre&s;i&s;tably chagrin'd, at the
Cor|ruption of our Publick <HI>Theatres.</HI>&mdash;But I was, lately,
enliven'd into <HI>Hope,</HI> upon this Subject; and am glad, I can a&s;&s;ure
my Rea|der, that there is a Spirit of Improvement at Work, to &s;u&s;tain our
&s;inking Ta&s;te, and &s;et Examples for our pre&s;ent Stages.</P>
<P>THERE is a generous Boldne&s;s, as well in the <HI>De&s;ign</HI>
it&s;elf, as in the <HI>Time</HI> of putting it in Execution. But nothing is
more certain, than that it is form'd upon a Plan, which if it meets with the
propos'd Encouragement, will go a great Way toward keeping the Hearts of the
Gay World from breaking, &s;hould &s;o dreadful a Misfortune happen, as that

Theatres in Fa&s;hion, by making Peo|ple a&s;ham'd of <HI>appearing,</HI> where
they ought to blu&s;h at their Entertainment.</P>
<P>I AM tran&s;ported to this Pitch of Joy, up|on having Landed at
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Stairs, in my Way from <HI>Barbican,</HI> to the
<HI>Abbey Cloi|&s;ters</HI> (where I often mu&s;e, on Subjects which, a long
Time hence, may fill <HI>Plain Dealers)</HI> and met, in the King's Highway, a
Party-colour'd younger Brother, of the ju&s;tly-cele|brated Mr.
<HI>Lun.</HI>&mdash;He was u&s;her'd along in great State, with a &s;ounding
Drum in his <HI>Front,</HI> and a Trumpet, and <HI>French</HI> Horn, plac'd
like Wings, on either <HI>Flank</HI>; while the <HI>Rear</HI> was brought up by
a Body of &s;catter'd <HI>Velites,</HI> the flying Fragments of Humanity!</P>
<P>THE <HI>Checquer'd Nuntio,</HI> as I pa&s;s'd him, &s;topt; and
nodded his loo&s;e Head at me: Snatching off his Pigmy Hat, by the Rab|bit's
Tail which was annex'd to it: And, tripping toward me, with a wanton
<HI>Wavine&s;s,</HI> like the Curling of a Ship's long Pendant, when it dances
in a Breeze, &s;lipt a <HI>Billet</HI> into my Hand; and, retreating, with a
merry Shrugg, or two, re&s;um'd his Po&s;t as before, and gave Continuance to
the Proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>FROM the ludicrous Turn of his Figure, I open'd the Paper he gave
me, with very humble Expectation: But was &s;truck with no &s;mall Reverence,
when I beheld the <HI>Royal Arms,</HI> magi&s;terially di&s;play'd at the Head

Regard to the <HI>other</HI> Companies, than, That, for <HI>One</HI> of their
Actors, who is <HI>Artificial,</HI> Six are ab&s;olutely <HI>Naturals.</HI></P>
<P>I GATHER'D much Con&s;olation too, from that other welcome
A&s;&s;urance, That the Di|ver&s;ions of <HI>this</HI> Royal Company, are to be
very <HI>Changeable,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;i&s;tivarious.</HI> The Town has,
Annually, for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, been <HI>dieted,</HI> by the <HI>Playhou&s;e
Doctors:</HI> And gone through a <HI>Regular Cour&s;e of Bitters,</HI> with a
mo&s;t laudable Spirit of <HI>Meekne&s;s,</HI> and true Chri&s;tian
<HI>Re&s;ignation</HI>&mdash;Their <HI>Wit</HI> was fall'n <HI>Sick,</HI> and
&s;ubmitted to <HI>Quack Potions:</HI> Becau&s;e Mountebank Stages, by being
<HI>Li|cens'd,</HI> had the Reputation of <HI>College Practice:</HI> (And, to
poi&s;on by <HI>Authority,</HI> has the good Fortune to be <HI>no
Felony</HI>).&mdash;So that nothing is more certain, than that the
<HI>Wooden</HI> Com|pany, will have the Advantage of our <HI>Brazen</HI> Ones,
in this important Point, <HI>the Changeable.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, as for the <HI>Con&s;i&s;tivarious,</HI> the old Workmen, I
am afraid, will be more than a <PB N="15" REF="16"> Match for the new
Ones.&mdash;I am not, in|deed, &s;o able a Critick, in the Language of the&s;e
Wooden Orators, as to decide, with any ab&s;olute Sufficiency, the
Signification of a Word, &s;o Derivative and Complex, as
<HI>Con&s;i|&s;tivarious:</HI> But, if I am fortunate enough, to have rightly
broke in upon &s;o impregnable a <HI>Decompo&s;ite,</HI> then, I am &s;ure, I
may &s;afely affirm, That our Stage's Conduct, ever &s;ince I can remember it,
has been <HI>truly Con&s;i&s;tiva|rious,</HI> in the mo&s;t remarkable and
&s;urprizing Manner.&mdash;Nay, a <HI>Triumvir</HI> of that de|tach'd
Admini&s;tration, the accompli&s;hed Au|thor of a <HI>Tragedy,</HI> which we
are to be admit|ted to the Honour of <HI>admiring,</HI> in the Front of this
happy Sea&s;on, is, I am &s;ure, &s;o re|nown'd for his
<HI>Con&s;i&s;tivariou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> that one wou'd almo&s;t be induc'd to
&s;wear, That the very <HI>Word</HI> was of his <HI>own making,</HI> and
coin'd, on Purpo&s;e, for his <HI>New Tragedy.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, here let me correct a fal&s;e Report, which this Great Writer
&s;uffers under, by the Means of &s;ome, who envy him the Honours which are due
to his <HI>undoubting Genius:</HI>&mdash;It is &s;aid, the Name of his New
Tragedy is to be <HI>Cae&s;ar in Egypt.</HI> But I a&s;&s;ure all Chri|&s;tian
People, that though <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> may &s;tand, in Capitals, on the
<HI>Title Page,</HI> yet that &s;hou'd only be con&s;ider'd as an <HI>Error of
the Pre&s;s</HI>; which the Buyer may <HI>correct</HI> with Ea&s;e, by reading
CIBBER <HI>in Egypt,</HI> in&s;tead of CAESAR: And, with that &s;mall
Alteration, every Thing in this Tragedy, will be found <PB N="16" REF="17">
extremely Natural; and &s;tand directly, as it <HI>&s;hou'd</HI> be.</P>
<P>THE Spirit, however of our new Under|takers, at the
<HI>White-Hart,</HI> is inflam'd into an enterprizing and &s;mart
<HI>Emulation!</HI> And I was very much taken with the Turn of this brisk
Defiance&mdash;That, tho' they may pa&s;s for <HI>Nobodies,</HI> becau&s;e they
are made of <HI>Wood</HI>; yet, &s;ince they have the Good Luck to be <HI>five
Foot high,</HI> they &s;ee no Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e their Adver&s;aries to be
<HI>more than their Match</HI>; and will, therefore, <HI>perform with &s;uch
Nicety, as not to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from them</HI>; and doubt not in the
lea&s;t, to give an <HI>equal Satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>AS for the next Paragraph, I fear it was purpo&s;ely embroider'd
over, with tho&s;e <HI>Like|wi&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Al&s;o's,</HI> for no other
Rea&s;on in the World, but to cover a con&s;cious Deficiency in the
<HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> by the Eloquent Glare of the
<HI>Ex|pre&s;&s;ion.</HI>&mdash;For, who does not ob&s;erve, That <HI>Dancing
of Jigs, Ma&s;querades, and Sarabands,</HI> are Improvements in Learning, which
the happy Genius of our <HI>Nobility,</HI> and the va&s;t Encouragement they
give to <HI>Wit,</HI> have brought, already, to their full Perfection?&mdash;I
can't &s;ee, therefore, what Novelty can be expected, in this Particular:
Unle&s;s, when they give Notice, That <HI>All their Performers are to be Wooden
ones,</HI> they wou'd have us under&s;tand it, that, by Aid of &s;ome <HI>third
Fau&s;tus,</HI> their <HI>Fiddles</HI> are to fall a <HI>Dancing,</HI> and keep
Time to their own Mu&s;ick.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">THE Ri&s;ing and Setting of the <HI>Sun,</HI>
I have very little to &s;ay for, with Regard to its
<HI>Newne&s;s.&mdash;Cupid</HI>'s <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> may plea&s;e at fir&s;t,
but will flatten, if they &s;hew it often.&mdash;The <HI>Court of Foreign

out-&s;oars, at one Flight, <HI>Patent, Licen&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Charter!</HI>
And it will be rea&s;onable to hope, after the Publick Ta&s;te has been &s;o
refin'd, by the&s;e <HI>Chips of a new Block,</HI> that we &s;hall &s;ee no
more Intermixture of the Ancient, with the Modern Dre&s;&s;es: Where the Order

<P>THERE is, in the next Article, an odd kind of My&s;tery, which I
own I could not fathom: And, I frankly confe&s;s, I was, once, afraid, there
might be a <HI>Plot</HI> in it.&mdash;I puzzled my Imagination, till I was
weary of imagin|ing.&mdash;But, the more I mus'd upon it, the <HI>le&s;s</HI> I
was able to <HI>make,</HI> of that &s;trange <HI>High-German Arti&s;t, who was
to &s;hake an empty Bag, in&s;ide out, that we might &s;ee, there was nothing
in it: And, then, rain Gold and Eggs out of it.</HI></P>
<P>IT was ea&s;ily to be di&s;cern'd, that the <HI>Scene</HI> was
<HI>&s;hifted</HI> in this Place.&mdash;The <HI>Play-hou&s;es</HI> 
<PB N="18" REF="19"> could have nothing to do with the Pa|ragraph: None of
<HI>Their</HI> Bags, for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, having been <HI>Empty</HI> enough
to turn in|&s;ide outward. So that I was greatly per|plex'd, by the
Knottine&s;s of this Difficulty: Till I, luckily, bethought my&s;elf of a
Friend of mine, a <HI>Decypherer</HI>; who&s;e &s;urprizing Dexterity, levell'd
every Rub in his Way, and made it as plain, as a Demon&s;tration, That the
empty Bag was the <HI>South-Sea Scheme.</HI>&mdash;That the Golden Showers were
the <HI>&s;udden Sallies of that Stock:</HI> And, that the <HI>Eggs</HI> were

<P>I SHOULD have been <HI>lo&s;t,</HI> in this <HI>De&s;art,</HI> if
I had not return'd, to make a Remark, concerning the <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> of our
new Comedi|ans.&mdash;How prai&s;e-worthy is their Genero|&s;ity, and the
Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of their Spirit! Who, after putting them&s;elves to the
two-fold Charge of <HI>building,</HI> both their <HI>Stage,</HI> and their
<HI>Performers,</HI> propo&s;e to act, notwith|&s;tanding, at <HI>Lower
Rates,</HI> than their Rivals; which La&s;t go on to <HI>demoli&s;h,</HI> as

<HI>rai&s;e</HI> their Prices, becau&s;e they <HI>fall</HI> their
Entertainments.</P>
<P>THEN, how ju&s;t, and how <HI>Sympathetical,</HI> is another Care
of our Wooden Reformers!&mdash;Being perfectly acquainted with the Talents of a
Modi&s;h Audience, they have judiciou&s;ly determined to provide Room for the
<HI>Coaches</HI> and <HI>Chairs,</HI> in the &s;ame Para|graph 
<PB N="19" REF="20"> with the <HI>Gentlemen.</HI>&mdash;Their Thoughts were
more upon <HI>Merit,</HI> than upon <HI>Good Breeding</HI>;&mdash;And &s;ince
they knew that their <HI>Kindred Vehicles</HI> were as <HI>able Judges,</HI> as
their <HI>Owners,</HI> and (which is of more Con&s;equence) as
<HI>well-dre&s;s'd</HI> too; they, therefore, thought it but rea&s;onable to

<P>WHAT kind of <HI>Play,</HI> that may be, which any

<P>WHEN I read, with Admiration, the great <HI>Actions</HI> of an
<HI>Alexander,</HI> a <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> or a <HI>Tamerlane</HI>; or an charm'd
by the more powerful <HI>Writings</HI> of a <HI>Homer,</HI> a <HI>Virgil,</HI>

<HI>gra&s;p</HI> Ideas, that are <HI>thin,</HI> and <HI>fleeting,</HI> I lament
that the <HI>Materials</HI> of the <HI>Painter</HI>'s <HI>noble Art,</HI> are
not as <HI>la&s;ting</HI> as the <HI>Painter</HI>'s Fame is. For, in that

tran&s;mitting <HI>Souls,</HI> the other <HI>Bodies,</HI> (or the outward Form

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>October</HI> the 7th.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I KNOW not whether I &s;hould return you Thanks for your la&s;t
Vi&s;it or not, becau&s;e I know not whether I am indebted to Fortune, or to
You for it. But I am obliged to take Notice, in a particular Man|ner, of the
De&s;ire you expre&s;s'd, during our being together, that I would have my
<HI>Picture drawn.</HI></P>
<P> AFTER I have omitted it &s;o many Years, I would not have it
drawn at la&s;t by a <HI>Bungler,</HI> and I am not in a Condition at
pre&s;ent, to &s;atisfy one who is a Ma&s;ter; nor do I know whether we have
any Ma&s;ter, <PB N="22" REF="23"> who would make me a <HI>Pre&s;ent</HI> of
it: Though a Painter is much more able to <HI>give,</HI> than a Poet to
<HI>buy</HI>; which has put me upon con&s;ider|ing, what are the Rea&s;ons
which make the <HI>Painter</HI> &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, and the <HI>Poet</HI> &s;o
un|fortunate; that make the Art of Poetry, and the Art of Painting, which are
Si&s;ters, &s;o very <HI>Re&s;embling,</HI> by <HI>Nature,</HI> &s;o very
<HI>Dif|ferent,</HI> by <HI>Fortune.</HI></P>
<P> A great <HI>Poet,</HI> for the mo&s;t Part, neglects and
affronts <HI>Fortune,</HI> by making his Court to <HI>Fame</HI>; but Fame and
<HI>Fortune</HI> are <HI>Rivals,</HI> that contend with each other, which
&s;hall heap mo&s;t Favours upon the de&s;erving <HI>Pain|ter.</HI> All the
great Painters that have ap|peared among us, have had Ju&s;tice done to their
Merit while they <HI>liv'd,</HI> and no <HI>Sign-po&s;t-Painter</HI> has ever
yet pa&s;s'd for a <HI>great Ma&s;ter.</HI> All the Painters, whom our Kings
have delighted to employ, have been Ma|&s;ters, as <HI>Holbin, Rubens, Vandyck,
Leeley, Ryley, Kneller,</HI> and <HI>Thornhill.</HI></P>
<P> BUT the contrary of this has happened with Regard to
<HI>Poets.</HI> Several good ones, nay, &s;everal of the <HI>be&s;t,</HI> have
been neglect|ed during their <HI>Life-time,</HI> as <HI>Spencer, Mil|ton,
Butler, Otway,</HI> among our&s;elves, and among the Ancients, <HI>Homer</HI>;
while the mo&s;t contemptible of all Scriblers have been E&s;teemed and
Honoured. Our Kings them|&s;elves have, more than once, had &s;uch vile
Scriblers for <HI>their Poets,</HI> and have, like For|tune, taken a Plea&s;ure
in <HI>exalting Fools.</HI> <PB N="23" REF="24"> But tho' a King can give a Man
Title and Place, only GOD can give him <HI>Genius.</HI> 'Tis the Prerogative of
a King to make a <HI>Knight,</HI> but only GOD can make a <HI>Poet.</HI></P>
<P> THE Rea&s;ons of the Difference which we &s;ometimes find, in
the Fortunes of great <HI>Poets</HI> and <HI>Painters,</HI> appear to me to be
chiefly the&s;e which follow:</P>
<P> The Fir&s;t is, That the great Painter, for each of his
Ma&s;ter-pieces, has but <HI>one</HI> Ori|ginal, and no <HI>Copy</HI> can come
up to the ea&s;ie Grace and the natural Force of a beau|tiful
<HI>Original</HI>; whereas, of ma&s;terly Poems, there are as many Originals,
as there are true Copies; and all of them have equal Force, and equal Grace and
Beauty; and this is none of the lea&s;t Things that render the Works of the
Painter &s;o precious, and the Arti&s;t him&s;elf &s;o fortunate. A Man may buy
the Works of <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil</HI> for a very Trifle, whereas
tho&s;e of <HI>Raphael</HI> are above any Value. But this multiplying of
Originals gives the great <HI>Poet,</HI> at lea&s;t, one Ad|vantage over the
famous <HI>Painter,</HI> which is, that it renders what he writes perpetual.
<HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> are immortal in their <HI>Works,</HI> but
<HI>Zeuxis</HI> and <HI>Apelles</HI> are only &s;o in their <HI>Fame.</HI></P>
<P> ANOTHER Rea&s;on of this Difference, is, The Univer&s;ality of
the Language in which the Painter delivers his Art: The great Painter &s;peaks
to all Countries as intelligibly, as to his own, nay, more intelligibly, more
gracefully, and more forcibly, to tho&s;e <PB N="24" REF="25"> Countries which
are polite; and, therefore, his Fame keeps equal Pace with his Merit; and
where-ever he goes, both Fortune and Fame attend him. The more his Pieces are
known, the more they are de&s;ired, and the more dearly purcha&s;ed. The
greate&s;t of Kings are ambitious to be Ma&s;ters of them, and ambitious to
po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>Painters,</HI> as well as their Works. What modern Poet,
during his <HI>Life-time,</HI> was ever <HI>read</HI> by &s;o many Sovereign
Princes, as were <HI>drawn</HI> by the Hand of <HI>Titian?</HI> What Prince
ever heap'd tho&s;e Honours on a Poet, that <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Fifth</HI>
did on <HI>Titian?</HI> Did the renowned <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> him&s;elf, with
all his Capacity, and all his Greatne&s;s of Mind, &s;o Honour <HI>Ho|race</HI>
or <HI>Virgil?</HI> Now, while the Painter's Fame and Fortune are unconfin'd,
tho&s;e of the greate&s;t of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets are re&s;train|ed to
the I&s;lands of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ire|land,</HI> that is, to
le&s;s than <HI>Twenty Millions of People,</HI> of which, perhaps, there are
hardly <HI>Five hundred</HI> which have a fine Ta&s;te of Poetry.</P>
<P> ANOTHER Rea&s;on of the Difference in the Fortunes of great
Painters and Poets, with regard to Painting after the <HI>Life,</HI> is the
darling <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> and the darling <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> of both
Sexes, and e&s;pecially of the Women; no Motive is generally &s;o predominant,
as that of Self-Intere&s;t, no Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o vehe|ment and &s;o ardent as
Self-Love. Now the Generality of both Sexes look upon their <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI>
as their <HI>very &s;elves.</HI> It is their <PB N="25" REF="26"> Per&s;ons,
then, which they ardently de&s;ire &s;hould be advantageou&s;ly known, and
fairly di&s;tingui&s;hed, and &s;hould remain after them. This the great
<HI>Painter</HI> alone can perform, who is &s;ure to draw the be&s;t
Like|ne&s;s, and yet, at the &s;ame Time, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h a Face, from all
other Faces what|ever, which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that the greate&s;t
<HI>Poet</HI> in the World, can ever do, by <HI>De|&s;cription.</HI></P>
<P> ANOTHER Rea&s;on of the fore&s;aid Dif|ference, is, That few
Per&s;ons pretend to decide &s;overeignly in <HI>Painting,</HI> but they who
are acquainted with the Rules of the Art, and who, be&s;ides the Reading
Ancient and Modern Hi&s;tory, under&s;tand <HI>Geometry, Per&s;pective,</HI>
and <HI>Anatomy</HI>; whereas the Rab|ble of Mankind pretending to judge of
<HI>Poetry,</HI> &s;overeignly, and without Appeal, wretched
<HI>Poeta&s;ters</HI> have been often <HI>applau|ded,</HI> and <HI>excellent
Poets neglected,</HI> becau&s;e the former write mo&s;t to the
<HI>Capacity</HI> of the <HI>Rabble.</HI> And there is one Thing, which I have
formerly mentioned, and which I have often ob&s;erved, and always with fre&s;h
Surprize, That the Rabble, by their Noi&s;e, their Clamours, and their
Ob&s;tinacy, have often drawn in Men who have pa&s;s'd for Men of Sen&s;e, to
affirm their unrighteous Decrees; whereas the Men of Sen&s;e, with all their
Judgment, and with all their Per|&s;everance, have never been able to draw in
the Rabble, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Time.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"> THERE is &s;till another Rea&s;on of the
fore&s;aid Difference in the Fortunes of great Poets and Painters, which is
this; Mo&s;t Men are very &s;en&s;ual; and Plea&s;ure of <HI>Sen&s;e</HI>
af|fects them, more than Plea&s;ure merely <HI>In|tellectual.</HI> They love to
have their Under|&s;tandings informed by their Sen&s;es, becau&s;e that
In&s;truction gives them <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> with|out any Mixture of Pain,
which always, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, accompanies Labour and great Attention. And
of all the Sen&s;es, they love chiefly to be in&s;tructed by the
<HI>Sight,</HI> becau&s;e the In&s;truction that comes that Way, is attended
with the lea&s;t <HI>La|bour.</HI> And if it be true, that there are no
<HI>innate Ideas</HI>; if it be true, that there is no|thing in the
Under&s;tanding, but what was in the <HI>external Sen&s;e before,</HI> then the
Me|thod of In&s;truction u&s;ed by the <HI>Painter,</HI> is the very Method
wich <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> have taken to in&s;truct us. And this is
the Cau&s;e of that extraordinary Plea&s;ure which Men receive from
<HI>Painting,</HI> as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> has ob|&s;erved in the Fourth
Chapter of his Art of <HI>Poetry.</HI> And, in this, the <HI>Painter</HI> has
in|finitely the Advantage of the <HI>Poet.</HI> The Painter informs the
Under&s;tanding, and warms the Imagination, by &s;triking the <HI>Sight</HI>
&s;trongly, and giving it the Height of Plea&s;ure; while all that can be done,
of that kind, by the greate&s;t Poet that ever liv'd, is to make us vainly
<HI>imagine,</HI> that he &s;ets Things before our <HI>Eyes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28"> THUS have I laid before you &s;ome of the
chief Rea&s;ons of the Difference that is found in the Fortunes of
<HI>Great</HI> Poets and Paint|ers; and, now, to end with the Bu&s;ine&s;s with
which I began, If he whom you pro|po&s;e to draw my Picture, is not a
<HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> I &s;hall be unwilling to give him any Trou|ble. If he is a
<HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> he is <HI>Rich,</HI> as cer|certainly as I am <HI>not
&s;o:</HI> I therefore expect, That he &s;hall do it <HI>intirely gratis</HI>;
For as <HI>Painter,</HI> and <HI>Poet,</HI> we are <HI>Si&s;ters Children,</HI>
and he is wor&s;e than a <HI>Jew,</HI> who, being <HI>Rich him&s;elf, will take
Money of a Poor Re|lation.</HI></P>

<P><HI>SATURN,</HI> the Son of COELUM, after having made a
Separation of Body and Goods with his Wife CYBELE, married NECESSITY the
Daughter of DESTINY and FORTUNE.</P>
<P>Old Father DESTINY gave this poor Girl of his, her
Education among the <HI>MUSES,</HI> and trained her up in the Company of
<HI>Poets</HI> <PB N="29" REF="30"> and <HI>Philo&s;ophers.</HI> She was
ble&s;&s;ed, from a very Child, with a &s;trong, and enterprizing Genius, quick
and ready at Invention, fruit|ful of mighty Projects, and ever intent upon
proper Ways and Means, to give a fini&s;hing Stroke to her Undertakings. But
though &s;he was ingenious, &s;he was homely in her Per&s;on; &s;he, poor
Thing! had none of tho&s;e Charms to boa&s;t of, which might draw the Eyes of
Lovers upon her; her <HI>Mien</HI> carried with it as little Temptation as her
<HI>Face</HI>; and her Fortune was <HI>low,</HI> and &s;till <HI>le&s;s
inviting</HI> than <HI>either</HI>; &s;o that &s;he was no Body's Ta&s;te, and
not any Individual breatheing had the lea&s;t Thought of her for a
<HI>Wife.</HI> The <HI>MUSES</HI> found the Charge grow heavy upon Them, and,
&s;en&s;ible of their Inability to go through with the Expence of keeping her
much longer, the begg'd DESTINY, by all means, to take her out of their Hands,
and think of making proper Provi&s;ion for her in &s;ome other Way. This put
DESTINY on trying to bring about a Match, between his Daughter, and his old
Friend SATURN, whom he per&s;uaded, that &s;ince he was &s;o far gone in Years,
and parted from his Wife, without any Appearance of their coming together
again; it was not po&s;|&s;ible for him to do better, than marry &s;ome
hone&s;t careful Body, who would be tender in looking after him: And then he
took Occa|&s;ion to name his own Daughter, as a Per&s;on well qualified for
that Office; a&s;&s;uring the old Gentleman, at the &s;ame Time, of her
Incli|nations <PB N="30" REF="31"> to do every Thing, that would be mo&s;t
plea&s;ing in his Eyes.</P>
<P>THE Truth is, NECESSITY was a good toward Girl, and
followed her Father's Coun|&s;el, &s;o well, and behaved her&s;elf with &s;o
much Docility, Humility, and Diligence, that &s;he intirely won the old Man's
Heart. That which prevailed with him, mo&s;t of all, to come to this
Re&s;olution, aro&s;e from this Con|&s;ideration, That all the Unea&s;ine&s;s
between him and CYBELE, was occa&s;ioned by her <HI>too great</HI> Riches,
which made her pre&s;umptuous enough to &s;light and de&s;pi&s;e him, and u&s;e
him &s;o ill, as to carry on a &s;ecret Affair with PLUTO, a Commerce, the
mo&s;t di&s;plea&s;ing in Nature to him, and which he could never forgive.
Hence he became per&s;waded, it would be doing very wi&s;ely, to marry a Wo|man
of Birth, who having nothing of her own, would think of no other Enjoyments,
but tho&s;e which &s;he &s;hared in common with him, which he knew to be
&s;ufficient to ren|der her eternally happy.</P>
<P>PRELIMINARIES were all &s;ettled, the Treaty concluded,
and the Marriage con|&s;ummated, between old SATURN, and his poor Spou&s;e
NECESSITY, who&s;e whole Portion con&s;i&s;ted in her <HI>Vigilance,</HI> her
<HI>Obedi|ence,</HI> and <HI>Humility.</HI></P>
<P>THE only <HI>I&s;&s;ue</HI> of this Marriage was VIR|TUE,
who from her Cradle, gave Promi&s;es of her Beauty. As &s;oon as &s;he grew up,
the mature Virgin drew gazing Crowds after her, <PB N="31" REF="32"> and the
Eyes of the admiring World was fix'd upon this Object. There was not that
&s;ingle God in <HI>Olympus,</HI> but was fond of her Acquaintance: However, as
&s;he happened to be of a high and over-ruling Temper, and would take the
Liberty of telling People their Faults very plainly to their Faces; &s;he was
not over-welcome to many, where &s;he went.</P>
<P>THEN, again, her Mother NECESSITY, who&s;e Company &s;he
was &s;eldom out of, was, by Nature, ba&s;hful, and little u&s;ed to fre|quent
the Palaces of the <HI>Great.</HI> She went always very <HI>plainly</HI> and
<HI>&s;imply</HI> cloathed, after the <HI>old Fa&s;hion,</HI> which made her
not a little timorous of vi&s;iting the <HI>modi&s;h</HI> Gods of
<HI>Quality.</HI></P>
<P>THIS manner of Life becoming trouble|&s;ome to them, they
went often to pay their Re&s;pects to the <HI>MUSES,</HI> and to &s;ee the
<HI>Poets</HI> and <HI>Philo&s;ophers,</HI> their old Friends, with whom they
always found a more friendly and grateful Reception. This made them think of
returning to the <HI>MUSES,</HI> and there to live for ever: And this NECESSITY
got her Husband to con&s;ent to, who approved of this Retreat the more
willingly, becau&s;e he very ju&s;tly judged, that the good Qualities of his
Daughter VIRTUE, might help a great deal, in that Place, towards correcting the
Vices and reforming the Errors of Man|kind.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY they returned to <HI>Parna&s;|&s;us,</HI> and
the <HI>MUSES</HI> obliged them with <PB N="32" REF="33"> fine Apartments,
where VIRTUE made her&s;elf known more and more, and was ad|mired by every Eye
that could get a Sight of her. The <HI>MUSES</HI> did all they could, to exalt
the Merit of their new Tenant; they left nothing un&s;aid, that might inlarge
her Reputation; they had a mighty Mind to captivate &s;ome &s;uitable Per&s;on,
and engage his Affections to her: But all in vain; there was not one Ear
<HI>rightly</HI> open to the&s;e repea|ted Prai&s;es and Admonitions. Whole
Crowds indeed would throng, to gaze at her, every Spectator Admired her, and
even every Hearer, when &s;he &s;poke, was forc'd to allow, That &s;he had
Rea&s;on for the Reprimands &s;he made; but not one of them would have any
Con|cern with her, or join them&s;elves for ever with a Per&s;on, who&s;e
Manner of Living was &s;o extraordinary and uncommon.</P>
<P>THUS &s;he remained a long Time unpro|vided for, 'till a
venerable Sort of Gentleman, oldi&s;h, but not very far in Years, who had the
Reputation of great Capacity, Ob&s;erva|tion and Experience, and who&s;e Name
was WISDOM, happen'd to light upon her. To him this <HI>tart</HI> Humour of
hers, which was always as <HI>ju&s;t</HI> as it was <HI>&s;evere,</HI> was not
at all di&s;ta&s;teful: On the contrary, he liked her for it; he made his Court
to her, and having addre&s;|&s;ed her Father and Mother for their Con&s;ent,
and obtained it, married her, to the univer|&s;al Joy of
<HI>Parna&s;&s;us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="34">THIS excellent Couple had I&s;&s;ue,
but One Child, named LABOUR, who, in his Infancy, gave them Trouble enough, in
all Con&s;cience, to rear him. As &s;oon as he approached the Age of Manhood,
he gave the mo&s;t apparent Signs of a <HI>working</HI> Head, and appeared
never <HI>ea&s;y,</HI> but when in <HI>Action.</HI></P>
<P>ONE Day, above the re&s;t, having clo&s;ely employed
him&s;elf upon an Undertaking of great Moment, a Task which his Mother VIRTUE
had been plea&s;ed to &s;et him; he &s;aw RECOMPENCE, the Daughter of MERIT and
of REASON, and became pa&s;&s;ionately in Love with her. Her <HI>Youth</HI> was
blooming, her <HI>Beauty</HI> exqui&s;itely charming; her Humour powerfully
bewitching; her <HI>whole Per&s;on</HI> irre|&s;i&s;tably ravi&s;hing: All
&s;he <HI>look'd,</HI> or <HI>&s;aid,</HI> or <HI>did,</HI> was &s;o engaging,
that it was <HI>natural</HI> in her to <HI>plea&s;e,</HI> and there was no-body
but loved her, no-body but longed to po&s;&s;e&s;s her.</P>
<P>LABOUR, who was nearly touched with &s;o many agreeable
Qualities, re&s;olved with him&s;elf to do every thing that &s;hould be
re|qui&s;ite to gain her; and, as &s;he did not want Lovers, he judged he
&s;hould meet with many Difficulties before he could attain his de&s;ired End:
But having received &s;ome joyful A&s;&s;u|rance, that the Figure he made in
the World, did not di&s;plea&s;e her, he re&s;olved to omit nothing, that might
make him &s;till more grateful in the Eye of his Mi&s;tre&s;s. After infinite
Pains, innumerable Hopes and Di&s;|appointments, the Treaty was at length
con|cluded <PB N="34" REF="35"> with MERIT and REASON, the Pa|rents of
RECOMPENCE, who gave their Con|&s;ent with great Alacrity; and the more, for
that VIRTUE her&s;elf did very heartily inte|re&s;t her&s;elf in that Affair.
Nay, farthermore, Advices came to the Parents of RECOMPENCE, that the Marriage
was APPROVED and DESIRED by COELUM, the Great-Grandfather to LABOUR.</P>
<P>IN Effect, LABOUR and RECOMPENCE were &s;o exactly
matched, that one may &s;ay, they were born <HI>one</HI> for the
<HI>other</HI>; their Mar|riage was perfectly happy, by the good
Un|der&s;tanding in which they lived; For LABOUR continuing towards his Wife
the &s;ame Affe|ction, de&s;ired to be everla&s;tingly in her Com|pany; he
could not bear her a Moment out of his Sight, by his good Will; and would
&s;carce be per&s;uaded, at Times, that he had &s;een her, when he really had.
His Wife was no le&s;s fond, on her Side; &s;he ob&s;erved a Conduct &s;o
regular, and &s;o judicious, that &s;he never gave him Rea&s;on of Complaint,
and would favour no-body with her <HI>Pre&s;ence,</HI> where her Husband was
<HI>ab&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Marriage was render'd &s;till more pro&s;perous by
its Fruitfulne&s;s. For, they had I&s;&s;ue Three Children, Two Girls, and a
Boy. The Boy, who was the Younge&s;t, was called REST: He was <HI>well
made</HI> in his <HI>Per&s;on, agreeable, in&s;inuating, welcome</HI>
where|ever he went: His noble Birth, and engaging Qualities, made him regarded
and coveted <PB N="35" REF="36"> by <HI>all</HI> the World, and chiefly by the
<HI>Rich.</HI> He was not of &s;o high a Spirit as his Si&s;ters: He vi&s;ited
none but Per&s;ons that were peace|ful, and little enterprizing. His
<HI>Father</HI> was angry at it, and did all he could to render him <HI>more
active,</HI> but he fled out of his Sight, becau&s;e continual &s;olliciting
him to do &s;ome|thing, di&s;turbed his <HI>Quiet,</HI> and interrupted his
Beloved <HI>Repo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>THESE repeated Sollicitations grew, at la&s;t, &s;o
in&s;upportable to REST, that, his Humour being no longer able to bear that of
his <HI>Father,</HI> which was &s;o <HI>oppo&s;ite,</HI> he harbou|red Malice
again&s;t him, and joining in an A&s;&s;ociation with IDLENESS, with whom he
had contracted a <HI>&s;trict Friend&s;hip,</HI> they plot|ted together to take
away the Life of the Parent of REST. But hone&s;t Father LABOUR, being
vigilant, was not long without di&s;co|vering this Con&s;piracy, of which being
but too certain, he drove this <HI>unnatural Son</HI> from him, nor would ever
&s;ee him more: REST, touch'd with <HI>Repentance,</HI> or pu&s;hed by
<HI>&s;ome other</HI> Motive, retired to the <HI>Service of the Gods,</HI>
where he has, ever &s;ince, taken up his Re&s;idence.</P>
<P>THE Two Daughters of LABOUR, were GLORY and PLEASURE, both
of them fine Per&s;ons, intirely like their Mother, &s;o very like her, that
they were often taken for her, which made her extreamly fond of them. LABOUR
loved them dearly too, as well on Account of their Merit, as for that <HI>near
Re|&s;emblance</HI> <PB N="36" REF="37"> of Features which made him re|member,
when his Heart was fir&s;t &s;mitten with Love.</P>
<P>THE Children, on their Side, dutifully an&s;wered this
Affection, and hardly ever quitted their <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Mother,</HI>
where-ever they went, whether to <HI>private People,</HI> or <HI>Princes,</HI>
where they <HI>mo&s;t</HI> delighted to make their Abode, and where they were
<HI>very wel|come,</HI> being &s;ignificant Per&s;ons in <HI>War</HI> and
<HI>Peace,</HI> and &s;hining as well in the <HI>Cabinet,</HI> as the
<HI>Field.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, that PLEASURE, was not &s;o lofty and proud of
Heart, as GLORY, her Si&s;ter: For whereas GLORY thought of no|thing but
<HI>great</HI> Things, and would frequent none but People of great Genius,
de&s;pi&s;ing all other Con&s;iderations; PLEASURE, on the contrary, could
amu&s;e her&s;elf with any thing, loving as well Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>little
Account,</HI> as that of <HI>Importance</HI>; the People of a <HI>midling,</HI>
as well as of the <HI>&s;ublime&s;t</HI> Genius; <HI>low,</HI> as well as
<HI>high</HI> Life, care&s;&s;ing all alike; which won her the Hearts of all
the World: As &s;he was, by Nature, very <HI>curious,</HI> &s;he diver|ted
her&s;elf with making little particular Jour|nies to People, who were glad to
have her in their Company, provided &s;he was not with her <HI>Father</HI> and
her <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> the <HI>Au&s;terity</HI> of whom, put them under too
great a Re&s;traint.</P>
<P>THESE little Sallies gave a <HI>Stain</HI> to her
Reputation, it not being po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee &s;o fine a Girl familiarly
vi&s;it &s;o many People, <PB N="37" REF="38"> without &s;peaking of it. But
what had like to have ruined her intirely, was, that at the &s;ame Time a
<HI>debauch'd Girl,</HI> who had &s;ome|thing of the <HI>Air</HI> of PLEASURE,
but much <HI>Affectation,</HI> took it in her Head to go by the <HI>&s;ame</HI>
Name, in order to find the <HI>ea&s;ier Acce&s;s</HI> in all Places. She was
the Daughter of LEISURE and DEBAUCH, de&s;picable People! and, as &s;he had
neither <HI>Birth</HI> nor <HI>Honour,</HI> &s;he mingled indifferently with
<HI>all Sorts</HI> of Per&s;ons, leading an infamous Life, and &s;o
di&s;orderly, that &s;he pa&s;&s;ed for one lo&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS Identity of Names, made them attribute to the
<HI>true</HI> PLEASURE, all the Di&s;orders of the <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> which
obliged her to clear up the Matter with her Father LABOUR, who was deceived,
like the re&s;t of the World, by this Appearance. But above all Things, her
<HI>con&s;cious Innocence,</HI> which they accu&s;ed her to have violated, gave
her great Confidence in her own Ju&s;tification. She made known to her
<HI>Father,</HI> that the greate&s;t Part of tho&s;e &s;he frequented, were the
be&s;t Friends of <HI>Him,</HI> and his Ance&s;tors, VIRTUE and WISDOM; That
&s;he was cheri&s;hed by a <HI>whole Sect</HI> of <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI>; and,
in &s;hort, That &s;he &s;aw <HI>none</HI> but People, who&s;e <HI>Manners</HI>
were <HI>Prai&s;e-worthy.</HI></P>

&s;uch a Novel Revere for &s;uch a Part of his Con|duct, but he is greatly to
blame in other Re|&s;pects: The principal Character in &s;uch a Book of
Memoirs, would be a Favourite, and a &s;hining Character, but for &s;uch and
&s;uch Blemi&s;hes and Imperfections. Such a Gal|lant, <PB N="43" REF="44"> in
&s;uch a Play, behaves him&s;elf well throughout the whole Action, and makes me
love him at my very Heart; but &s;uch a Gal|lant has a villainous De&s;ign at
Bottom, up|on his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Honour, and is my mortal Aver&s;ion. After
having thus remark'd up|on Texts, out of the Lady's own Scripture, it is
Inexpre&s;&s;ible, what an Effect it might have, if growing into a &s;udden
Rapture, <HI>A&s;pa&s;ia</HI> &s;hould go on as follows: How does it charm and
tran&s;port one, to find all the&s;e Vertues, and none of the oppo&s;ite Vices;
all the&s;e Beauties without Deformities, united in that one Favourite
Character of mine, the <HI>Chri|&s;tian Hero,</HI> de&s;cribed with all the
Force, with which Vertue can be de&s;cribed, and painted with all the Beauties
with which Beauty can be painted?&mdash;This Method, or &s;uch a Me|thod as
this, would prompt the li&s;tening, <HI>booki&s;h</HI> Ward to a De&s;ire of
&s;eeing that Tract; &s;he would long for it, &s;he would enquire af|ter it,
&s;he would beg to read it; &s;he would &s;et to reading it already prejudiced
in its Fa|vour; It would gain upon her, in the Read|ing, till &s;he gained,
what her Guardian would wi&s;h, from reading it. As &s;he has true Ta&s;te,
this ju&s;t Picture, would beget in her a Con|tempt of tho&s;e coar&s;e
Daubings of a Nove|li&s;t's gro&s;&s;er Hand. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the
<HI>Heroines,</HI> celebrated in her favourite Romances. How much more
charmingly is the <HI>fine Lady,</HI> de&s;cribed in the Marque&s;s of
<HI>Hallifax</HI> his Advice to a Daughter, and &s;o of <PB N="44" REF="45">
others.&mdash;What Fruit may not be hoped and expected:&mdash;Reading that
little Book, called, <HI>The Advice to a Daughter,</HI> and the <HI>Lady's
Li|brary,</HI> is enough to make young Women learn to <HI>Know
them&s;elves:</HI> STEELE<HI>'s Chri&s;tian Heroe,</HI> and the <HI>Gentleman
In&s;tructed,</HI> teach them abundantly to know Men. A <HI>Know|ledge</HI> of
<HI>them&s;elves,</HI> will be the <HI>Pre&s;ervative</HI> of their
<HI>Honour</HI>; and a <HI>true Knowledge</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> will fortifie

<P> IN One of your PAPERS concerning DETRACTION, you ju&s;tly
ob&s;erved, That Per&s;ons guilty of it, in a great <HI>City,</HI> ought to
have &s;ome <HI>Di&s;tingui&s;hing Signs</HI> to di&s;cover them, as
Cro&s;&s;es are placed on the Doors of the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;ed,</HI> in the Time
of a Pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P> THAT happy Way of Rea&s;oning (in|&s;eperable from Truth) which
&s;hines in all your Writings, on what&s;oever <HI>Subject</HI> em|ployed,
carries Conviction in every Line, that gives the <HI>Good Man</HI> Plea&s;ure,
and the <HI>Envious</HI> and <HI>Detracting,</HI> Pain.</P>
<P> THEN to whom &s;hall I apply for Re|dre&s;s, but to the PLAIN
DEALER, who, tho' above flattering the Great, thinks it not unworthy him, to do
Ju&s;tice, even to the <HI>Lowe&s;t</HI> Degree of Merit.</P>
<P> WAS I to draw the Man I mean, in the Character of <HI>Husband,
Father,</HI> or <HI>Friend,</HI> in each, he would plea&s;e and &s;atisfy; but
as tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing Characters, are Private, tho' Undi&s;puted, I
will beg leave to tell you, He has, in <HI>Active</HI> Life, a <HI>Fame,</HI>
that <PB N="47" REF="48"> gives Unea&s;ine&s;s to &s;ome malignant People,
while it does Good, more widely than they wou'd wi&s;h him able to extend
it.</P>
<P> IF an indefatigable Indu&s;try, with his allowed
<HI>Skill,</HI> and <HI>Humanity,</HI> crowned by the Ble&s;&s;ing of the
<HI>ALMIGHTY,</HI> with un-interrupted Succe&s;s, can recommend a Man to

&s;een him) going to the Relief of &s;ome mi&s;erable Object, with his u&s;ual
Chearfulne&s;s and Smiles (with that Regard however to the Cau&s;e, which the
Greate&s;t could wi&s;h for, the Unhappy &s;eldom find) as if he was going to
&s;ome Great Man, who&s;e Cure mu&s;t make his Fortune; tho' he is certain to

Patient.</P>
<P> INNUMERABLE In&s;tances of this Kind the Grateful Many he has
&s;erved, wou'd give, who, tho' willing, are not allow'd to do him the

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="48" REF="49">WHEN I reflect upon the many Advan|tages
ari&s;ing to Mankind, from the Skill of a True Profe&s;&s;or of the Surgeon's
Art, he ap|pears &s;o U&s;eful a Member of the Common-Wealth, that he makes no
<HI>incon&s;iderable</HI> Fi|gure among the mo&s;t <HI>con&s;iderable,</HI>
like <HI>Ma|chaon</HI> among the Heroes in <HI>Homer.</HI> The Per|&s;on, this
Letter relates to, far from meriting to be &s;poken ill of, de&s;erves that
re&s;pect, which the be&s;t of all Books requires to be paid to the
Phy&s;ician, if it was for nothing el&s;e, but having, not long &s;ince,
pre&s;erved the Life of a Member, of a very noble Fa|mily, in which
<HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Eloquence</HI> have been a long Time
<HI>Hereditary.</HI></P>
<P>AS I am brought once more, unwill|ingly, to touch upon that hated
Subject, <HI>DETRACTION,</HI> I think I cannot do better, in order to deter
People, from it, than to place before their Eyes a Picture of its Defor|mity,
as it was drawn by that Great Ma&s;ter <HI>APELLES,</HI> and De&s;cribed by an
excellent old Author.</P>
<Q> 
<P> AT the Right-Hand, was drawn Sit|ting, a Man, with long Ears,
put|ting forth his Hand to <HI>DETRACTION,</HI> who &s;eem'd from afar off to
come towards him. About this Man &s;tood two Women, that is to &s;ay,
<HI>IGNORANCE</HI> and <HI>SUSPICION:</HI> On the other &s;ide came
<HI>DETRACTION,</HI> a Woman dre&s;s'd in great Pomp and Magnificence, but in a
<PB N="49" REF="50"> mighty Pa&s;&s;ion of Anger, having her A&s;|pect like
Fire. In her Left-Hand, &s;he held a burning Torch, and with her other, &s;he
drew, by the Hair of his Head, a young Man, who held up his Hands to|wards
Heaven, calling God, to Witne&s;s his Innocence: With Her, came a Woman, Pale
and Evil-favoured, beholding the the young Man attentively, like one that had
been con&s;umed with long Sickne&s;s, whom you might ea&s;ily conjecture to be
<HI>ENVY.</HI></P> 
<P> THERE followed two other Women, who made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to
adorn <HI>DETRACTION:</HI> One was <HI>TREASON,</HI> the other <HI>FRAUD:</HI>
After, followed a Woman in Mourning, Black and Ragged, called
<HI>REPENTANCE,</HI> who turning her Back, and &s;ore a&s;hamed, beheld
<HI>TRUTH,</HI> who then came forward.</P></Q>
<P>IT is thus, <HI>APELLES</HI> de&s;cribed <HI>DE|TRACTION,</HI> by
which he him&s;elf was brought into extream Danger, having been fal&s;ely
accu&s;ed to King <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> who, upon his refuting
the Accu&s;ation, or|dered him as many Talents, as would amount to Twelve
Thou&s;and Pounds Sterling, and that his Accu&s;er &s;hould be his perpetual
Bonds-man.</P>
<P>IF &s;ome curious Engraver would form a Plate, upon this Model;
the be&s;t Method would be for Per&s;ons this way Injured, to 
<PB N="50" REF="51"> purcha&s;e a Ptint, and fix it, like a Play-Bill, at the
Door of any noted Offender; after which, it &s;hould be a Rule for the
Neigh|bourhood, never to believe a Report that came from that Quarter, whether
in <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> or <HI>Di&s;prai&s;e</HI> of any Body.</P>
<P>BY this Means, the <HI>TONGUES</HI> of <HI>Evil-Speakers,</HI> and
the <HI>PENS</HI> of <HI>Evil-Writers,</HI> would become <HI>U&s;ele&s;s,</HI>
and <HI>Unregarded</HI>; and Innocence, having nothing to fear, might look,
untrembling, upon Slander.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> YOU were pleas'd, in a late <HI>PLAIN DEALER,</HI> to threaten
the Male-World with an Inundation of <HI>Female-Wit.</HI> Before we are &s;o
happy as to have this com|fortable Tide break in upon us, I conceive it to be

hone&s;ty con&s;cious of his Wife's Superiority, to furni&s;h you with fit

<P> I THINK it a wi&s;e Man's Part, to be <HI>humble,</HI> in the

<HI>&s;peak without boa&s;ting,</HI> when I inform You, That I am able to read
my own Name, among the Wor&s;hipful, The Commi&s;&s;ioners for Con&s;ervation
of His Maje&s;ty's <HI>Peace.</HI>&mdash;But I have a <HI>Wife!</HI> who, not
to prai&s;e her, more than &s;he really de&s;erves, wou'd have made a better
<HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> than I am.&mdash;Her Under|&s;tanding blazes out, to the

is apt to <HI>&s;nap,</HI> a little, in her flaming: For which, in order to be
Even with her, I have given her the Name of <HI>SNUBSY.</HI></P>
<P> THE wor&s;t of it is, She confines her Talent to <HI>one
Science:</HI> And, &s;o, her Quali|ties, which, if divided, might have adorn'd
a hundred Arts, are, All, profu&s;ely lavi&s;h'd, for Improvement of that

<P> MY Spou&s;e, good Sir, to be plain with you, is far gone in
<HI>Palme&s;try</HI>: But <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>She,</HI> being intimate

<P> I ALLOW her a <HI>Study,</HI> to her&s;elf, at the End of a

from the <HI>Dragon's Tail,</HI> to the <HI>Mount</HI> of <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<P> THO' I believe her at my Heart, yet I pretend to make a Doubt
of it; becau&s;e <PB N="55" REF="56"> there can be no <HI>prettier

&s;tand amaz'd at the Improvement of her Natural Parts, by the Benefit of
frequent Practice, upon Secrets, I am utterly a Stranger to!</P>
<P> WE have a New Mini&s;ter in our Pari&s;h, and, the fir&s;t Time
he came to dine, at our Hou&s;e, I &s;hall never forget how he &s;tar'd, when
<HI>SNUBSY</HI> began to &s;hew her Learn|ing!&mdash;She no &s;ooner looked in
his Hand, than &s;he told him, He would be made a <HI>Bi&s;hop.</HI> He is
counted a Man of <HI>Letters,</HI> and yet he was not able to
<HI>di&s;prove</HI> it; tho' he own'd, indeed, <HI>It was unlikely:</HI> For,
&s;he reduced it to a Demon&s;tration, little le&s;s than
<HI>Mathematical</HI>; by <HI>Squares, Trines, Cir|cles, Stars, Spots, Tokens,
Signs, Lines,</HI> and <HI>Figures,</HI> of a thou&s;and different Sorts,
<HI>Di|rect, Tran&s;ver&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Parallel:</HI> Pur&s;uing every
Argument, with an invincible Force of Rea&s;oning, through the <HI>Cavea
Martis,</HI> to the <HI>Via Solis</HI>; and unravelling all the
<HI>Cro&s;&s;es,</HI> in the <HI>Tuberculum,</HI> on the <HI>Mons
Sa|turni;</HI> 'till &s;he came within reach of the <HI>Via Lactea,</HI> under
the <HI>Girdle</HI> of <HI>Venus:</HI> And there the <HI>Doctor</HI> &s;topt
her, and made Ac|knowledgements of his Satisfaction.</P>
<P> WE went lately to &s;hew <HI>Bedlam,</HI> to a
Country-Cou&s;in, who came up to vi&s;it us: And, in the middle of the long
Room, my <HI>SNUBSY</HI> took a Fancy, to let her Kin&s;|woman 
<PB N="56" REF="57"> woman &s;ee how fine a Skill &s;he was Mi&s;tre&s;s of: In
order to which, &s;he fell to reading us a <HI>Lecture,</HI> over the Palm of a
&s;ilent <HI>Lunatic</HI>; who, with a Rugg about his Shoulders, ve|ry quietly
gave her his Hand, through the <HI>Grate</HI> he was &s;tanding at&mdash;She
had ju&s;t pointed out, How his <HI>Mons Mercurii</HI> be|came afflicted, by an
Evil-line, from his <HI>Mons Lunae,</HI> when the Patient be&s;prinkled her
Face, with a Bowl-full of a certain Ill-&s;cented Liquor, of his own making,
which his other Hand had concealed behind him. We were, all, in good Mea&s;ure,
made Par|takers of his Bounty. But my Cou&s;in, and I, were beginning to quit
&s;ome Part of it, which we thought we &s;hould have no U&s;e for, when we were
interrupted by our dripping <HI>Chiromancer,</HI> who ran between us, all in
Tran&s;port, holding her Hands as high as our Eyes, and crying out, with great
Ve|hemence, That <HI>Her Fears were now over</HI>;&mdash;For &s;he had
fore&s;een, by a <HI>Combu&s;t-Line,</HI> between her <HI>Pollex</HI> and her
<HI>Cardiac,</HI> That &s;he &s;hould be in Danger of a Violent Death, either
by <HI>Drowning</HI> or <HI>Suffocation!</HI></P>
<P> IT is not in my Power to explain to you All the Benefits, which
I receive from this Profoundne&s;s of my Spou&s;e's
<HI>Fore&s;ight.</HI>&mdash;Other People, when they take <HI>New Servants,</HI>
are forc'd to &s;end, and enquire their <HI>Cha|racter:</HI> But my little
Conjurer, does but peep upon their Palms, and &s;atisfies her &s;elf
immediately.&mdash;I had a very &s;trong Parti|ality <PB N="57" REF="58"> for a
&s;miling Country, Girl, that came, la&s;t Week, to offer her Service, in the
Qua|lity of a <HI>Chamber-Maid.</HI> But upon the very fir&s;t In&s;pection, my
Examiner charg'd her Home, With <HI>Three Favourite Sweethearts</HI>; and then
whi&s;pered &s;omething in her Ear, which &s;he &s;taid not to return an
An&s;wer to; but ran, blu&s;hing, out of Doors, in the ut|mo&s;t Hurry and
Di&s;order. And this <HI>Di&s;co|very,</HI> my <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra</HI>
a&s;&s;ured me, was ground|ed meerly upon <HI>Palmi&s;try</HI>; the Girl having
a manife&s;t <HI>Triangle,</HI> on the Bottom of the <HI>Mount</HI> of
<HI>Venus,</HI> which extended &s;o far downward, as to make a <HI>Cleft</HI>
in her <HI>Re|&s;tricta.</HI></P>
<P> I WAS, once, in &s;ome kind of Danger to have been drawn into a
<HI>Plot</HI>; but my <HI>SNUBSY</HI> found it out, in the Palm of my Hand; and
in Pre&s;ence of a <HI>Mini&s;ter of State,</HI> who, I can a&s;&s;ure You,
made no &s;mall U&s;e of Her, convinc'd me, beyond Di&s;pute, that I &s;hould
bid fair for being <HI>hang'd,</HI> by Virtue of a <HI>crooked Line, that
cro&s;s'd my</HI> Via Combu&s;ta. This frighted me from my fooli&s;h Purpo&s;e:
But, I re|member, I was &s;trangely comforted, to di&s;|cover, at the &s;ame

Lord|&s;hip had a <HI>Combu&s;ta,</HI> as <HI>dangerou&s;ly mark'd,</HI> as
mine was.</P>
<P> AFTER &s;o happy a Deliverance, by In|terpo&s;ition of Her Art,

<PB N="58" REF="59"> Succe&s;s I got over the Heathen Names of her
<HI>Planets</HI>; and knew what Parts of her Hand they <HI>kept Hou&s;e</HI>

forward, unbecoming my Ho|nour and Gravity, to apply my &s;elf to an Art, that
had treated my Office with &s;uch Indignity. And, as often as I ca&s;t my Eye
upon the&s;e Venerable Words, <HI>Ju&s;tice of the Peace,</HI> and &s;aw them
mix'd with &s;uch Ill Company, I clos'd my Fi&s;t in a Fury, and would &s;tudy

<P> YET, in the Way my <HI>SNUBSY</HI> pra|ctices, Truth compells
me to confe&s;s, It is an inexhau&s;table Fund of Benefits, both to my Self,
and to the Publick.&mdash;If I happen to be &s;ick, &s;he con&s;ults

le&s;s Learning, feel Change of Weather, in their <HI>Toes,</HI> &s;he reads
it, under her <HI>Fingers.</HI> In &s;hort, it is impo&s;&s;ible for any Body,
but One, who knows as much of her as I do, to imagine what &s;trange Sings and

<P><PB N="59" REF="60"> To &s;uch a powerful Pitch of Perfection

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> IN my La&s;t, I laid before You a &s;hort Character of the
pre&s;ent Magi&s;trates of this <HI>City</HI>; and &s;ome Account of the
Fac|tious Spirit, that too often di&s;turbs Them, and their Laudable
Undertakings. I am not at all &s;urpriz'd to hear, That many of your
<HI>Readers,</HI> among my own <HI>Country|men,</HI> have taken Offence at my
Free Cor|re&s;pondence, notwith&s;tanding the Sanction of <HI>your</HI>
Judgment, under which it is publi&s;hed.</P>
<P> PREJUDICE will always make the World Unea&s;ie: Whatever
Cau&s;e it pro|ceeds from, it never fails to govern the Under&s;tanding, in a
very &s;hameful Man|ner. And, tho' it is often no more than the imbib'd Sen&s;e
of a &s;econd Per&s;on, which a Man makes u&s;e of as his own, it 
<PB N="61" REF="62"> is rarely, and with great Difficulty, re|&s;train'd from
producing innumerable bad Con&s;equences in Life, with the Face and Appearance
of &s;omething that is Good; it mixes it &s;elf with every Circum&s;tance and
Action, and has every where a powerful Influence. One Man calls it
<HI>Religion,</HI> ano|ther <HI>Principle</HI>; and he who dares be Blunt, owns
it by its plain Name of <HI>Party.</HI> What|ever is done, or &s;aid, upon this
Founda|tion, though never &s;o Faulty, &s;hall find <HI>Advocates</HI>; and,
however Prai&s;e-worthy, <HI>Condemnation.</HI> What a Shame is it to
Rea|&s;on, to hear it avow'd, That &s;uch a Sett of Men can do Nothing
<HI>Ill,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>on our Side?</HI> And &s;uch another, Nothing
<HI>Well,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>they Vote with our Enemies?</HI>&mdash;But Enough
of this Subject.&mdash;If, as 'tis ge|nerally own'd, The Publick Good &s;hould
be the Point mo&s;t in View, of each Indi|vidual, I ought to re&s;t
&s;atisfied, and may de&s;pi&s;e the Spleen of my Cen&s;urers.</P>
<P> BUT, Sir, I am inclined to con&s;true fa|vourably, and,
perhaps, the Indignation that &s;ome People expre&s;s again&s;t good
Per|&s;ons, and good Things, is not &s;o much the Effect of <HI>Vice,</HI> as
of <HI>Ignorance.</HI> As when a <HI>Scheme</HI> is propo&s;ed for Publick
Benefit, <HI>Blockheads</HI> may innocently decry it, becau&s;e they cannot
comprehend it. This I take to be the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, from the dull
Op|po&s;ition, that I have wonder'd to &s;ee made again&s;t &s;everal highly
generous and profi|table <PB N="62" REF="63"> Undertakings. Men, who&s;e Souls
are &s;hort-&s;ighted, love to walk in Old <HI>Ways,</HI> becau&s;e they are in
no Danger of being <HI>lo&s;t,</HI> while they have a Hedge at each Elbow. Thus
the <HI>Hotentots</HI> adhere to their Hereditary Dirt and Nakedne&s;s: Thus
the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> too, were formerly in&s;tiga|ted to <HI>rebel again&s;t
the Yoke,</HI> in Defence of their ancient Privilege of <HI>drawing Ploughs by
their Hor&s;es Tails,</HI> with all the <HI>Wit</HI> of a <HI>free-born</HI>
Stedfa&s;tne&s;s. And, I am &s;orry I have Cau&s;e to &s;ay, That for a
Rea&s;on of this goodly Sort, my <HI>Neighbours</HI> love &s;tink|ing Streets,
and hate the Innovation of <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary Hou&s;es.</HI></P>
<P> IF in this Part of the World, we chance to hear of a
<HI>Project to make us Cleanly,</HI> we wonder at the <HI>crack-brain'd
Whim&s;ie,</HI> and guard our Hearts again&s;t <HI>Vanity.</HI> If it is
undertaken at the particular Expence of the Propo&s;er, we di&s;courage the
Guilt of &s;o pre&s;uming a Genero&s;ity. Nay, let a Thing be actually
executed, and compleatly done to our Hands, we have &s;till Spirit enough to
<HI>rail</HI> at it, with the mo&s;t ma&s;cu|line Inflexiblity. In this, and
other Re|&s;pects, I have In&s;tances in my <HI>View</HI>; and my
<HI>Neighbours</HI> will take my <HI>Meaning,</HI> tho' not my
<HI>Coun&s;el.</HI></P>
<P> IT were ea&s;ie, SIR, to expatiate upon the <HI>Ignorance,</HI>
and <HI>Partiality,</HI> that prevail among our People, were I inclined to
write <HI>Satyr,</HI> and expo&s;e the Weakne&s;s of my <PB N="63" REF="64">
Country-men. But, as I am unwilling to &s;pread their Defects, I beg Leave, on
the the other Side, to lay before you &s;everal more of the Ble&s;&s;ings and
Ornaments our <HI>City</HI> boa&s;ts of!</P>
<P> YOU have done us the Honour, to di|&s;tingui&s;h the Genius and
Virtue of &s;ome of the ri&s;ing <HI>Generation,</HI> in one of your PAPERS;
and my la&s;t begins an Account of the FAIR ASSEMBLY here in
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> which, not|with&s;tanding the Oppo&s;ition of our
<HI>Clergy,</HI> is one of the be&s;t <HI>Nur&s;eries</HI> of
<HI>Politene&s;s</HI> in <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI> By Means thereof, our Youth of both
<HI>Sexes,</HI> learn a Habit of Briskne&s;s and Freedom, which, till of late,
were le&s;s frequent among us. That Re|&s;traint, and Stiffne&s;s of Air and
Addre&s;s, which di&s;tingui&s;hed us from People of more generous Education,
by Decrees, wears away; and Conver&s;ation, which was formerly &s;o confin'd,
and &s;o dull, grows open, free, and ea&s;ie: <HI>Ladies</HI> find they may
<HI>&s;peak</HI> to <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> without Violence to their
<HI>Mo|de&s;ty,</HI> and <HI>Gentlemen</HI> may <HI>entertain Ladies,</HI>
without De&s;igns upon their <HI>Virtue.</HI> It is now no more a
<HI>Sight,</HI> when a Lover waits on his Mi&s;tre&s;s Home, or takes a Walk
with her in a Garden. Nay, we have Husbands, who, without Jealou&s;ie, can hear
Batche|lours invite their Wives to an Entertain|ment. In &s;hort, we exchange
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Affectation and Gravity, for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Liberty and Free Spirit; and, in Place of <PB N="64" REF="65"> <HI>Narrow
Minds,</HI> and the <HI>vile&s;t Hypocri&s;ie,</HI> we are growing Profane
enough to a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Dignity</HI> of <HI>Humane Rea&s;on,</HI> and the
<HI>Inno|cent Privileges</HI> of <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P> PERHAPS I am not mi&s;taken, when I affirm, That this
<HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> (I beg Leave of the <HI>Clergy</HI> to make Bold with the
Word, becau&s;e I have as Good a Title to it, as they have) is, in a great
Mea&s;ure, the Effect of the <HI>Union</HI> of the Two Kingdoms. But, when I
con&s;ider it is an Advantage, I wou'd not be thought to mean, that
<HI>either</HI> Nation is yet too Happy under the Effects of their
<HI>Incorporation.</HI> It may be allow'd us, I pre&s;ume, to wi&s;h, that
however &s;trictly they are united, they may never be bound &s;o clo&s;e, but
that one Hand may be loo&s;e enough to a&s;&s;i&s;t and unite the other, if it
is not quite <HI>impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> there &s;hou'd ari&s;e, in &s;ome future
Age, &s;uch a Miracle, as a <HI>Cor|rupt Mini&s;try</HI>; or a Prince, le&s;s
watchful, than our pre&s;ent Glorious SOVEREIGN, for the Defence of his Peoples
Liberties.</P>
<P> BUT I am no Politician; nor will I at|tempt to Enlarge upon a
Subject that fits not the Purpo&s;e of your PAPER; though I promi&s;e my
&s;elf, That the PLAIN DEALER will not &s;cruple, when Occa&s;ions ri&s;e, to
a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Rights,</HI> as well as the <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> of a <HI>True
Briton.</HI></P>
<P> I PROCEED to Remark, That as the Corre&s;pondence and
Communication between the now United Kingdoms, has, in a great 
<PB N="65" REF="66"> Mea&s;ure, improv'd and poli&s;h'd the <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI>
the <HI>Air,</HI> and the <HI>Fa&s;hions,</HI> of both the Gentle|men and
Ladies of my Country; &s;o it has al&s;o refin'd our Language, in a very
&s;en&s;ible Manner. I do not mean the <HI>Accent</HI> and
<HI>Pronunciation,</HI> when we <HI>&s;peak</HI> it&mdash;For the&s;e are
hardly to be naturaliz'd without much Time, and continual Conver&s;e; there
being, in <HI>England</HI> it&s;elf, a <HI>Shibboleth,</HI> peculiar to every
County. No wonder then, that <HI>Scots|men</HI> find it difficult to come up to
their Standard.</P>
<P> BUT, if you'll allow, that we make &s;ome Progre&s;s in the
<HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of the Lan|guage, we will readily give up our
Preten|&s;ions to the <HI>Graces</HI> of it. Yet our way of pronouncing the
<HI>Vowels</HI> has Advocates in <HI>Foreign</HI> Countries: And, perhaps, the
Autho|rity might de&s;erve a Review with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P> I have wonder'd, to &s;ay Truth, that we are &s;uch Proficients
in the Language, con|&s;idering we have neither a <HI>Court,</HI> nor a
<HI>Thea|tre,</HI> which are the acknowledged <HI>Fountains</HI> of its
Refinement.</P>
<P> WHEN I look into the Writings of Mr. <HI>DRUMMOND</HI> of
<HI>Hathornden,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>JAMES</HI> I. Sir <HI>GEORGE
MACKENZIE,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>CHARLES</HI> II. The Earl of
<HI>LAU|DERDALE,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>JAMES</HI> II. Bi&s;hop
<HI>BURNET,</HI> and Mr. <HI>FLETCHER</HI> of <HI>Salton,</HI> in the two
la&s;t Reigns; and of a certain noted Wri|ter, <PB N="66" REF="67"> in the
pre&s;ent; when I compare their Style with the Style of &s;ome of their
Co|temporaries in <HI>England,</HI> I am tempted to think my Country-men not
&s;o very far inferiour, as that <HI>Criticks</HI> &s;hou'd depreciate our
Preten&s;ions to the Language. But, when I con&s;ider too, That whatever
Ele|gance, or Ma&s;tery, of that Sort we arrive at, is as much a
<HI>Virtue</HI> in us, as 'tis <HI>Nature</HI> in You, I am vain enough to
imagine, that we merit no le&s;s Prai&s;e; at lea&s;t &s;hou'd meet with fair
<HI>Indulgence.</HI></P>
<P> ONE Thing more I beg leave to Re|mark, with Re&s;pect to our
Language. Many of our Words, that &s;eem <HI>Uncouth,</HI> and are not
under&s;tood by <HI>Engli&s;h-men,</HI> are, notwith&s;tanding, of
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Origin; and are not le&s;s <HI>Emphatical,</HI> and
<HI>Worthy,</HI> for being <HI>Ob&s;olete</HI> among You. I find few old Words
in <HI>DOUGLAS</HI>'s <HI>VIRGIL,</HI> that are not al&s;o to be found in
<HI>CHAUCER:</HI> And, perhaps, our <HI>ALLAN RAM|SAY,</HI> a living
<HI>Ver&s;ifier</HI> in Old-Style, u&s;es few that are not to be met with in
<HI>SHAKESPEAR, SPENCER,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;except, when he coins Words, by
vir|tue of his <HI>extra-judicial</HI> Poetick Privileges, that never were, and
never will be, u&s;ed by any Mortal, be&s;ides <HI>Him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P> LIVING Languages, are like living Trees; they have their Summer
and their Winter. The <HI>Words</HI> of the One, like the <HI>Leaves</HI> of
the Other, fall off, and are &s;uc|ceeded <PB N="67" REF="68"> by a new
Generation. It is, how|ever, Di&s;cretion's Work, in this Ca&s;e, to Naturalize
none, at the Expence of better.</P>
<P> YOU &s;ee, Sir, with what Freedom I write my Sen&s;e both of
<HI>Per&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Things</HI> to you. I own, I ob&s;erve no Order in
the Form of my <HI>Letters:</HI> Nor do I believe <HI>That</HI> wou'd recommend
me more to your Regard. What I chiefly aim at, is, A na|tural
<HI>Simplicity</HI> in my Expre&s;&s;ions, and a <HI>Truth</HI> in my Facts,
becoming a Corre&s;pon|dent of the <HI>PLAIN DEALER.</HI></P>
<P>'I HAVE the Honour to be with due Ve|neration,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your tru&s;ty Intelligencer, and mo&s;t Obedient Servant,
<HI>FERGUS BRUCE.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>AFTER having thank'd my Corre&s;pondent, for the Continuance of
his agreeable Intelli|gence, I &s;hall clo&s;e with a &s;hort Remark on on what
he &s;ays, concerning our Language.</P>
<P>I AGREE with Him entirely, that many of of our old Words had the
&s;ame <HI>Original</HI> with theirs; for all that Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
to the the Southward of the <HI>Frith,</HI> was as much <HI>Saxon</HI> as we
were: So then the Foundation of our Language being the &s;ame, it is not &s;o
rea&s;onable, as I wi&s;h it were, to allow this ingenious Gentleman the Claim
he makes, in <PB N="68" REF="69"> Behalf of his Country&mdash;That the Elegance
and Ma&s;tery, which are by <HI>Nature</HI> in Us, are a <HI>Virtue</HI> in
<HI>North Britain.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Nature</HI> is certainly alike to both Na|tions: The
<HI>Virtue</HI> is mo&s;t due, where the Im|provement was <HI>fir&s;t</HI>
made. The <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> have, at
lea&s;t, for Ages pa&s;t, been as learned as the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and much
more accu&s;tom'd to foreign Travel and Corre|&s;pondence. The&s;e are the
great, and indeed the only Cau&s;es of Refinement in a Lan|guage&mdash;For
<HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Luxury</HI> are much more likely to corrupt it, by the
Confu&s;ion they introduce, mixing Degrees and Di&s;tin|ctions, and contracting
our Care to regard no|thing &s;o much as <HI>INTEREST.</HI></P>
<P>SINCE then the <HI>Scotch</HI> Language was once the very &s;ame
with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; and &s;ince their People have been more intimately
Con|ver&s;ant, than ours, among Foreign Nations; and have always enjoy'd the
&s;ame A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Learning, and yet have been behind us in the
Improvement of our common Tongue; it follows by Nece&s;&s;ity, That the
Prai&s;e of <HI>Virtue</HI> is in ours&mdash;But it is a <HI>Birth-right,</HI>
which, like <HI>Kenti&s;h Gavel-Kind,</HI> we mu&s;t equally divide with our
Brothers, in the next Generation: for, tho' they were &s;low Setters out, they
have prov'd Them&s;elves as good Runners, and will be a-brea&s;t with us, in
the Race, and lo&s;e no Ground for the Future.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> WHEN Parents have &s;o much Zeal for their Childrens
<HI>Promotion,</HI> and &s;o little for their <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> as to force
them to <HI>Marry</HI> the Per&s;on they have an <HI>Aver&s;ion</HI> to, How is
the World mov'd, with a Ten|derne&s;s of Concern! And Nature &s;hock'd with the

<P> SUCH a Con&s;traint has always met with its ju&s;t
Di&s;couragement: And your <HI>Predece&s;|&s;or in</HI> PLAIN DEALING took it
under his Care. But, Whether it is from the <HI>Pride</HI> of <HI>one Sex,</HI>
who are fond of the <HI>Reputation,</HI> even, of a Lover whom they
<HI>Hate</HI>! Or, from the un|ju&s;t <HI>Partiality,</HI> of the

<HI>Inhumanity,</HI> and well they may! But what &s;hall we &s;ay of
<HI>Him,</HI> who con|tinues to <HI>teize</HI> the Woman, who <HI>abhors</HI>
him? who wou'd force her to make a <HI>Pro|&s;titute</HI> of her <HI>Love?</HI>
To en&s;lave her&s;elf to Intere&s;t? And, when her Refu&s;al has drawn down
the Re&s;entment of her Parents, lays it, all, on his <HI>Exce&s;s of
Love.</HI></P>
<P> IS Love then &s;o <HI>ba&s;e</HI> a Pa&s;&s;ion? So void of
Tenderne&s;s? So unlike it&s;elf, and all its generous Pretences? that it can
feed on the <HI>Quiet</HI> of the beloved Object! and <HI>&s;teal from it</HI>
the Joy which it has not Power to <HI>give it!</HI> No, no, The real Lover
knows not how to <HI>Offend.</HI>&mdash;His Happine&s;s <PB N="71" REF="72">
mu&s;t ri&s;e, and fall, with <HI>Hers,</HI> who in|&s;pir'd his
Pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;But if, on the contrary, His De&s;ires run <HI>Counter</HI>
to her Happine&s;s, It is not <HI>Love</HI>; It is <HI>Brutality!</HI> And, if
He, who is thus <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s'd,</HI> &s;uppo&s;es Him&s;elf in Love, He is
deceiv'd, and wou'd deceive Others.</P>

<P> THIS, Sir, is <HI>my own</HI> Misfortune, to be mi&s;erably

</LETTER>
<P>IT the Admiration, which is due to &s;uch a Merit as this Lady's,
did not place her above Pity, I cou'd be &s;orry for that Per&s;ecution, which
&s;he Laments, in &s;o <HI>Elegant,</HI> and <HI>Pathe|tic,</HI> a Manner. The
Gentleman, who is &s;o unhappy as to be the Subject of her Com|plaint, will be
the la&s;t, that feels the Force of it.&mdash;There is a <HI>Love of
our&s;elves,</HI> deeply rooted in human Nature, that impo&s;es on us, fir&s;t,
and, then, emboldens us to impo&s;e on Others. We do not <HI>approve</HI> the
Faults, which we are guilty of; But, which is almo&s;t as bad, we <HI>cannot
&s;ee</HI> them:&mdash;We join hear|tily in, with tho&s;e, who condemn the very
Follies which are mo&s;t remarkably <HI>our own</HI>; and are all the while
in&s;en&s;ible how ridicu|lous we appear to Others, by adhering pub|lickly 
<PB N="73" REF="74"> to the <HI>Practice</HI> of what we, as pub|lickly,
continue to <HI>Cen&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>IT is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the harde&s;t Le&s;&s;on of Nature, to
correct the Extravagancies of <HI>Love.</HI>&mdash;Where this Pa&s;&s;ion is
Real, It will be the <HI>Sovereign</HI> of the Mind. It moulds the Soul to its
own Purpo&s;es; and lends its own Eyes to the Under&s;tanding. Neither does it
depend, for its Violence, or Moderation, on the Capacity of the Lover, but on
the Pro|portion, in which it actuates him. The Wi&s;e Man, in this Ca&s;e, has
no Prerogative, above the Fool. It is in <HI>Love,</HI> as it in
<HI>Madne&s;s,</HI> The more Exalted the <HI>Genius,</HI> the more un|bounded
the <HI>Raging!</HI>&mdash;A Wi&s;e Man may much better <HI>defend</HI>
him&s;elf, than a Fool can; But, when He <HI>yields,</HI> there is no
Difference; becau&s;e <HI>Opinion,</HI> in this Pa&s;&s;ion, always &s;tands in
the Place of <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>THIS being the Ca&s;e, <HI>AMANDA</HI> has &s;mall Encouragement;
who, by appealing to what is <HI>Rea&s;onable,</HI> would di&s;&s;wade her
Lover from what is <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary.</HI>&mdash;Her Charms have deprived his
Life of every Comfort, but what <HI>She</HI> gives it; and, while He loves, at
the Rate &s;he &s;ays he does, it will be im|po&s;&s;ible for him, to
<HI>think</HI> him&s;elf &s;o much in the Wrong, as &s;he finds him.</P>
<P>IT would, certainly, be a Great Happi|ne&s;s, if Men, who love,
without Hope, could de&s;i&s;t, without Mi&s;ery: For, be&s;ides that
<HI>AMANDA</HI>'s Argument has thrown an Air of ungenerous Selfi&s;hne&s;s, on
the <HI>Ob&s;ti|nacy</HI> <PB N="74" REF="75"> of &s;uch Addre&s;&s;es, there
is This further Mi&s;chief in it, That a Lover, whom an avowed <HI>Hatred</HI>
cannot repul&s;e, in his Appli|cation, cuts off his Right, when he becomes a
<HI>Husband,</HI> to complain of, or return, <HI>Ill U&s;age,</HI>&mdash;Is
&s;he too Cold, too Unkind, too Di&s;dainful, for a <HI>Wife?</HI>&mdash;How
much grea|ter is His Fault, who <HI>fore&s;aw</HI> all This, and, yet, would
<HI>make her one?</HI>&mdash;He <HI>loved</HI> Her, before She <HI>pitied</HI>
Him, and con&s;ented to be|come <HI>His,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t open
<HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of her In&s;en&s;ibility! And how Ba&s;e, and
Ungenerous mu&s;t it be, To make the <HI>Continuance</HI> of that
In&s;en&s;ibility his Pre|tence for treating her Ill, after &s;he has put her
&s;elf under his Protection; which, while &s;he refus'd, and dete&s;ted him,
had no Power to move his Re&s;entment!</P>
<P>EITHER, He ought, with a manly Forti|tude, to <HI>tear</HI>
him&s;elf from the Remembrance of an Object, &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of his
Torments; or, in Gratitude, for a Compliance, that was Involuntary, and the
Effect, rather, of Compa&s;&s;ion, than of Love, He &s;hould re|&s;olve to
&s;upport him&s;elf under the Misfortune of her Aver&s;ion, without permitting
his own Sentiments to be imbittered, by the Effects of it; till, by a
Progre&s;s of per&s;wa&s;ive Soft|ne&s;s, He &s;hall have touched her reluctant
Heart, and prepared it to receive Impre&s;&s;ions, as well of <HI>Love,</HI> as
of <HI>Gratitude.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, how Mon&s;trous is the Brutal Figure, which I have &s;een
&s;ome <HI>Husbands</HI> make! <PB N="75" REF="76"> who, when <HI>Lovers,</HI>
were the Poore&s;t, and mo&s;t Abject, of all <HI>Slaves!</HI>&mdash;When they
&s;hould be <HI>Defenders,</HI> they are <HI>Tyrants</HI>; and when it was
rea&s;onable for them to have been <HI>Provoked,</HI> they were <HI>&s;tupidly
Submi&s;&s;ive!</HI>&mdash;How contemptible is their unmanly Weak|ne&s;s! A
moro&s;e and re&s;tle&s;s <HI>Peevi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> makes up the Behaviour they
expect to <HI>charm by!</HI> They contract a &s;urly, &s;ower Habit, from the
Di&s;appointments they meet in Life; and, in&s;tead of &s;oftening the Edge of
Afflicti|on, toward the Woman, who is bound to &s;hare their Sufferings, they
double them on <HI>her Head,</HI> from whom, (in Honour, and Hu|manity) they
ought to ward off Sorrow, by a noble Sweetne&s;s, and endearing Tenderne&s;s in
their whole Behaviour!</P>
<P>BUT the plea&s;ante&s;t Stupidity of all, is, That when, by a
Length of Savage Cruel|ties, they have made them&s;elves compleatly Odious;
they are impudent enough to <HI>won|der, How it happens that their Wives appear
no fonder of them?</HI></P>
<P>THERE is no Part of our Life that requires a nicer Conduct than
our Choice of the Per|&s;on, with whom we are to <HI>vow an in&s;eperable
Union;</HI> and, yet, there is Nothing, which we venture on, with more
Ra&s;hne&s;s; or which we examine, with &s;o little Fore&s;ight!&mdash;And,
hence it is, That <HI>MATRIMONY,</HI> with equal Satyr, and Ju&s;tice, has been
com|pared, by one of our Old Poets, To a <HI>Crowd</HI> in the <HI>Street,</HI>
which excites a Curio&s;ity, in <PB N="76" REF="77"> every
<HI>Pa&s;&s;er-by,</HI> to add one Fool to the Number: But, they are no
&s;ooner in the mid&s;t of the Pre&s;s, than they grow unea&s;y at their
Situation, and are as Eager to elbow out again, as they were, before, to gain
Ad|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>BY this Time, I &s;uppo&s;e, I pa&s;s for an <HI>Out-of-the-Way
Old Humouri&s;t,</HI> who has No|thing in him, but a few <HI>odd
Whim&s;ies,</HI> which he takes Delight to be noted for. But, now the

<PB N="78" REF="79"> <HI>State</HI> upon me: And before the <HI>Winter</HI> is
half out, I &s;hall cau&s;e it to appear, <HI>pretty Plainly,</HI> That I can
make free with <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Poli|ticks,</HI> as well as with
<HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Impertinence.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS walking, the other Day, near the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI>
and took up a little <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> that lay in my Way, at a Book&s;eller's
Shop, Intituled, <HI>New, and Accurate Ob&s;ervations, on the Coa&s;t of
GUINEA.</HI>&mdash;I was pleas'd with this Subject: For, tho' I inform'd my
<HI>Reader,</HI> my fir&s;t &s;etting out, That I was an <HI>Enemy to the
Ea&s;t-India Company,</HI> (by which hangs a <HI>Secret,</HI> that may be
di&s;clos'd in &s;ome future Paper) yet I am a <HI>Lover of THE ROYAL
AFRICAN:</HI> And have good <HI>Rea&s;ons,</HI> for <HI>both Opinions.</HI></P>
<P>THE Gentleman, who is Author of the above-mention'd
<HI>Treati&s;e,</HI> is a <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> new|ly return'd from the
<HI>Coa&s;t</HI> he writes of.&mdash;He &s;eems to be a Per&s;on of
<HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Experi|ence</HI>; and expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with a
Warmth of <HI>Spirit,</HI> that carries in it a Generous <HI>Plainne&s;s,</HI>
and a rough, but Manly, <HI>Integrity.</HI>&mdash;When I began to peru&s;e his
<HI>Book,</HI> I thought He ap|pear'd too <HI>Angry:</HI> But, before I had
read it out, the <HI>ill U&s;age</HI> He complains of, &s;eem'd incapable of
being remember'd, without an Agitation of &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ions, as mu&s;t leave
him fully acquitted.&mdash;The <HI>Abu&s;es</HI> and
<HI>Mi&s;ma|nagements,</HI> which this Gentleman enumerates, are &s;uch, as I
am &s;orry to hear of, becau&s;e their <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> mu&s;t affect
the <HI>Company,</HI> in too &s;en&s;ible a <HI>Manner.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">I HAVE often reflected, not without the
utmo&s;t Amazement, from what &s;trange <HI>Cau|&s;es</HI> it &s;hou'd happen,
That the <HI>Credit</HI> of <HI>that Company</HI> has been &s;unk, to &s;o low
an <HI>Ebb</HI>; &s;ince nothing can be more demon&s;trable, than that It has
<HI>Advantages,</HI> beyond Compari&s;on, above all others, to make it &s;elf
the mo&s;t <HI>Flouri&s;hing!</HI>&mdash;If any Deficience, within
them&s;elves, with Regard to <HI>Stock,</HI> or <HI>Encou|ragement,</HI> is the
Prevention of their <HI>Good Pur|po&s;es,</HI> methinks, their
<HI>Complaints</HI> cou'd be no &s;ooner heard, than they wou'd be &s;ure of a
<HI>Remedy!</HI> For, even as they, now &s;tand, no <HI>Company</HI> exi&s;ts,
that is of &s;uch <HI>Importance</HI> to the <HI>Nation.</HI>&mdash;If the
Intere&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> in Re&s;pect to <HI>Trade,</HI> depends mo&s;t,
as it certain|ly does, upon her <HI>American Plantations,</HI> tho&s;e
Plantations do, as certainly, depend on the <HI>Slave-Trade</HI> from
<HI>AFRICA.</HI> A <HI>Trade!</HI> that &s;trengthens us, in the very Vitals,
and fir&s;t Principle of <HI>Government:</HI> For it is perpe|tually adding
Encrea&s;e to the Numbers of our u&s;eful People; far beyond the
progre&s;&s;ive <HI>Growth</HI> of our <HI>&s;low,</HI> and <HI>Natural
Multipli|cation.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Nation,</HI> too, (in Point of <HI>Wealth,</HI> as well as
<HI>Power</HI>) is, to an infinite Degree, more advantag'd than <HI>The
Company,</HI> by Effect of this <HI>Negro Traffick.</HI> When the
<HI>Company</HI> have &s;old a <HI>Slave,</HI> That Profit, which they once
make, is <HI>All</HI> the <HI>Benefit,</HI> which he can, ever, bring
them.&mdash;But, for the Benefit of the <HI>Nation,</HI> there is no computing
what may be <PB N="80" REF="81"> gain'd, by him. Not only the Wretch,
him|&s;elf, but his Children's Children, after him, down to the late&s;t
Generations, are, for ever, doom'd to <HI>Work</HI>; and <HI>All</HI> their
Product is the <HI>Nation's.</HI>&mdash;The Difference is Va&s;t, and
Infinite!</P>
<P>THE Extent of Country, comprehend|ed within the Limits of <HI>This
Company's Char|ter,</HI> is Prodigious and A&s;toni&s;hing! For above
<HI>Thirty Degrees,</HI> on one Side, from the <HI>Line,</HI> and about
<HI>Twenty,</HI> from the other, all the <HI>Coa&s;t</HI> is within their
Limits: So that they have all the <HI>Good,</HI> Variety, of Soils, and of
Latitude, which the <HI>whole World</HI> can afford them.&mdash;They have,
con&s;equently, within their Bounds, a proper Earth and Climate, for every rich
Product, that we pick up here and there, at the remote&s;t Di&s;tances, from
one Side of the <HI>Globe</HI> to the other.&mdash;They have not, it is true, a
Claim of Property to the <HI>Lands:</HI> But, how ea&s;ily might they
purcha&s;e it, as far as cou'd be nece&s;&s;ary, at Rates too incon&s;i|derable
to de&s;erve the naming?&mdash;They have I&s;lands too, and Settlements, never
&s;ubject to the Natives In&s;ults.&mdash;Why might not the&s;e be cultivated?
Why not <HI>Rice, Sugar, Indigo, Cotton, Ginger,</HI> and <HI>Tobacco,</HI>
brought hence, as well as from <HI>America?</HI> And how much &s;ooner, and
ea&s;ier?</P>
<P>IN one &s;hort and comprehen&s;ive View, may be &s;een a
Demon&s;tration of the Diffe|rence, as to the <HI>Company's Profit,</HI>
between the <HI>Slaves</HI> they tran&s;port to <HI>America,</HI> and tho&s;e 
<PB N="81" REF="82"> whom they might employ, if they pleas'd, to rai&s;e
Products, for their own Benefit.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay nothing of the Charge of Shipping them, which wou'd be

ma|fe&s;t Advantage, of cheaper <HI>Freight,</HI> and &s;hort|er
<HI>Voyages,</HI> what can be plainer than this Way of
Rea&s;oning?&mdash;Compute the <HI>Company's</HI> Profit, by the Sale of a
<HI>Negro,</HI> to be Equal with what might be Gain'd by him, in a <HI>Year's
Work,</HI> over and above his Maintain|ance, and the Intere&s;t of his Prime
Co&s;t, (which it certainly never is) yet, the <HI>Negro,</HI> that
<HI>WORKS</HI> for the <HI>Company,</HI> co&s;ts no more, than One, who is
<HI>SOLD,</HI> for them: Whereas this <HI>La&s;t</HI> is wholly
<HI>Lo&s;t,</HI> from that Day forward, to their Intere&s;t; while the
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> returns them Yearly, the <HI>&s;ame Profit, during Life,</HI>
without new <HI>Charge,</HI> to Balance it.</P>
<P>I SPOKE, ju&s;t now of Products, which are commonly rais'd, by our
<HI>Planters</HI> in <HI>America</HI>; and might, as certainly, be rais'd in
<HI>Africa</HI>; But there are <HI>Ea&s;tern Harve&s;ts,</HI> of much greater
Con&s;equence, which <HI>Time,</HI> I hope, will teach <HI>This Company</HI> to
reap, without more Difficulty, than may gradually be &s;ur|mounted!&mdash;Why
not the riche&s;t of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indian Spices, Pepper, Nutmegs,
Cloves,</HI> and <HI>Cinnamon,</HI> procur'd and planted there? They have
<HI>Soil</HI> and <HI>Climate</HI> exactly the &s;ame, with tho&s;e in which
they grow: Nay, they have <HI>wild Spices,</HI> ri&s;ing naturally, under their
<PB N="82" REF="83"> Agent's Eyes, to be as it were, an <HI>Indication,</HI>
and pu&s;h 'em forward, to Attempt it!</P>
<P>BUT, if they will not be per&s;waded to <HI>tran&s;plant</HI>
Advantages, at lea&s;t they might po&s;|&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of tho&s;e, which
lie before them. They have <HI>Gold,</HI> which the Natives gather and bring
down to their Forts and Factories. I know what <HI>Difficulties</HI> attend the
<HI>View,</HI> I am about propo&s;ing: And I know too, that tho' they are
<HI>Con&s;iderable,</HI> they are <HI>far from Un&s;ur|mountable.</HI> What
hinders, then, but that the <HI>Uplands</HI> might be di&s;cover'd; and perhaps
the <HI>Gold Mines</HI> found, and work'd upon, by the Natives them&s;elves,
for the <HI>Company's</HI> Bene|fit, in Exchange, for what tho&s;e Natives
va|lue more, but which wou'd co&s;t little to their Furni&s;hers? And this
Attempt, tho' peacea|bly e&s;tabli&s;h'd and pur&s;ued, might, for more certain
Safety, be protected by the Awe of an Armed Force: A very &s;mall one, were
&s;ufficient here, where Numbers are of little Strength, for want of Courage or
of Order.</P>
<P>HOW much more U&s;eful, than &s;ome of their pre&s;ent Factories,
would Forts and Settle|ments be, a Hundred Miles, or more, in Di|&s;tance, One
above the Other, along the <HI>Ni|ger,</HI> or &s;ome other of tho&s;e
Prodigious <HI>Rivers,</HI> which flow a Cour&s;e of two or three Thou|&s;and
Miles, through the <HI>Heart</HI> of this va&s;t and unknown
<HI>Continent?</HI> How ea&s;ie were it for the People in the&s;e Forts, to
po&s;&s;e&s;s and cultivate, a large Tract round them? To di&s;|cover the

<HI>Rivers:</HI> And once a Year, or oftener, to &s;end down their General

with the Return of their &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, what &s;hould be &s;ent them from

to their un&s;peakable En|richment?&mdash;And were &s;uch an Entrance once

of Con|&s;umption, would it not occa&s;ion, in our <HI>Wool|len,</HI> and many

<P>THERE are no Impo&s;&s;ibilies, in De&s;igns, of this Nature, but

this <HI>Company</HI> has the Honour to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Great Genius's,

dare not, therefore, attempt &s;o hard a Task as his full Character: But, while
I mention him, I am on Fire, with &s;uch an Admiration of his Generous
Qualities, that I cannot forbear to clo&s;e my Paper, with &s;uch faint
<HI>Out-lines,</HI> as can be Sketch'd, by One who <HI>draws</HI> at too much
Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>IT is not alone, in the Princely Grandeur of his
<HI>Oeconomy,</HI> that this Illu&s;trious Lord reflects a Brightne&s;s on his
<HI>Honour'd Order,</HI> and points out to us, in a &s;hining Light, what a
<HI>Nobleman</HI> was meant to be. <HI>Appear|ance,</HI> He well knows, can be
no more than the <HI>Shadow</HI> of Sub&s;tantial <HI>Glory.</HI>&mdash;He
looks inward, therefore, and draws out, into Pra|ctice and Example, &s;uch a
&s;urprizing Train of <HI>Vertues,</HI> That, in&s;tead of &s;upporting his
<HI>Di|&s;tinction</HI> upon the <HI>Title,</HI> which was &s;o ju&s;tly due to
his, He has added <HI>to it</HI> much more <HI>Honour,</HI> than &s;ome, who
wear it with a Colder Spirit, have been able to borrow <HI>from it.</HI></P>
<P>THO' De&s;cended from a <HI>Noble Line,</HI> one of the mo&s;t
<HI>Ancient</HI> of the Kingdom! He di&s;|dain'd <PB N="85" REF="86"> to owe
his Greatne&s;s to the Grandeur of his <HI>Ance&s;tors:</HI> Nor ever thought
of his <HI>Fore-Father's Honours,</HI> but as an Archer rai|&s;es his Eye to
the Point of &s;ome high Steeple, when he would &s;hoot his Arrow <HI>over
it.</HI></P>
<P>HOW Incon&s;iderable, in &s;o Generous a <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> as
<HI>His,</HI> are all the <HI>Glitterings</HI> of a <HI>De|pendant
Greatne&s;s!</HI> How much Nobler, after <HI>His, more than Imperial,</HI>
Manner, to adorn and &s;erve this Country, his own un|bounded Expence, than to
be more bu&s;ie, to perhaps le&s;s Purpo&s;e, and be <HI>Paid,</HI> for his
Want of <HI>Liberty,</HI> at the <HI>Head</HI> of an
<HI>Admini|&s;tration!</HI></P>
<P>THE World lies open, to his Eye, and All its Intere&s;ts are
exactly known to him: But nothing can he &s;ee, in any Part, or happy Corner of
it, more belov'd and worthy, than he him&s;elf is!&mdash;There is this too,
Peculiar in him, That his <HI>Mind,</HI> with all its <HI>Va&s;tne&s;s,</HI> is
&s;erenely <HI>Centrical</HI> and <HI>Regular:</HI> His <HI>Pur|po&s;es</HI>
are as Rational as Great. His <HI>Under|&s;tanding</HI> is Clear. His
<HI>Penetration</HI> is Bound|le&s;s. His <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> is Ardent; and
his <HI>Ap|plications</HI> are Calm and Stedfa&s;t!</P>
<P>HE knows, and marks, the nice&s;t Diffe|rence between Dignity and
Pride, Genero&s;ity and O&s;tentation; Conde&s;cen&s;ion and
Weak|ne&s;s!&mdash;He reconciles State with Ea&s;ine&s;s; and teaches Reverence
to Freedom! How Ex|ten&s;ive is his Wi&s;dom! How Unwearied his Indu&s;try! How
Magnificent his Liberality! How Enlarg'd are his Idea's! How Unre|&s;train'd 
<PB N="86" REF="87"> by Prejudice! How Unconfin'd to Party!&mdash;What
A&s;toni&s;hment would it pro|duce, in the Minds of ordinary Men, could a a
Hi&s;tory be given the World, of the Im|men&s;ity of tho&s;e Princely Expences,
which might be charg'd to his Humanity!&mdash;The Charity of the Common World
would blu&s;h, and hide it &s;elf at the Compari&s;on: For the Munificence of
this prodigious <HI>Spirit,</HI> would &s;wallow up all other Benignity, as the
Enli|ven'd <HI>Rod</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> devour'd the Serpents of the
<HI>Egyptians.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are his <HI>Known</HI> and <HI>Publick Beau|ties!</HI> But,
what Amiable <HI>Private Qualities</HI> mu&s;t there be, in &s;o exalted a
<HI>Mind!</HI> which are hid from the di&s;tant <HI>World,</HI> and appear only
to tho&s;e <HI>Few,</HI> tho&s;e <HI>very Few,</HI> of his Friends, who not
alone are conver&s;ant with him; but have <HI>Souls &s;ympathetical</HI> enough
to conceive the <HI>Glowings</HI> of his untold <HI>Purpo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>UNDER the Influence of <HI>&s;uch a Power,</HI> what may not the

Re&s;olve upon &s;uch <HI>Mea&s;ures,</HI> as may &s;uit the <HI>Glory</HI> of

<P>THERE is no kind of <HI>Wit,</HI> which re|quires a livelier

in&s;cribe on <HI>Monuments,</HI> to expre&s;s the <HI>Characters</HI> of the

every Church, in <HI>England,</HI> is a Witne&s;s of our De|ficience in
it.&mdash;The Fire of <HI>Fancy</HI> &s;hould, on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, be
extreamly Inten&s;e, and Subtile, becau&s;e, wanting Continuity, it has all its
<HI>Effect</HI> at a <HI>Fla&s;h</HI>; and can therefore have no
<HI>Medium:</HI> It mu&s;t be either <HI>piercing</HI> or
<HI>contemptible.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I &s;tand before the <HI>Tomb</HI> of Mr. <HI>Dry|den,</HI>
in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey,</HI> I am in Debate with my &s;elf concerning
that Delicacy of Ve|neration, which was the Cau&s;e of its being in&s;crib'd
with no more than his <HI>Immortal Name.</HI>&mdash;The Noble Founder thought
it Superfluous to add any Thing, after that: <PB N="88" REF="89"> Becau&s;e
there &s;carce <HI>lives</HI> a <HI>Reader,</HI> who can be unacquainted with
his <HI>Character.</HI>&mdash;Yet, methinks, on the other Hand, the
Expre&s;&s;ion of a Decent <HI>Gratitude,</HI> may be held Due to a
<HI>Benefactor,</HI> however rais'd above the Want, or Expectation of our
Benevolence. And, to carry it yet farther, tho' no Profanation cou'd be more
unpardonable, than the Pro|duct of a <HI>Vulgar Genius,</HI> on a
<HI>Subject</HI> &s;o exal|ted, there is, at lea&s;t, <HI>One Spirit,</HI> in

<HI>Monument</HI> mu&s;t have known, more certainly than any other Per&s;on,
becau&s;e more nearly conver&s;ant with, and more &s;ufficiently a Judge of,
him.</P>
<P>I WOU'D not, after this, &s;ay, I mean Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> but
that, in the Cour&s;e of my <HI>Papers,</HI> I &s;hall let him perceive, that I
am no <HI>Flatterer.</HI>&mdash;I have wi&s;h'd to &s;ee <HI>His Soul</HI> do
Honour to his <HI>Father's Du&s;t,</HI> and animate a Marble, which can never
be more dignified, than it is, unle&s;s <HI>His own Remains</HI> &s;hou'd
vi&s;it it!&mdash;When my <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> feel his <HI>Force,</HI> in
<HI>Eloi&s;e's</HI> &s;truggling <HI>Conflicts,</HI> I attend him, thro' the
<HI>Depths</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> with the Reve|rence which is due to
God-like <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Philo&s;ophy!</HI> And, while my Fancy
flames, and glitters, in the &s;portive Va&s;tne&s;s of his <HI>Levity,</HI>
where <HI>Belinda</HI>'s <HI>Hair</HI> attracts him, I am tran&s;ported at his
<HI>Wit,</HI> and <HI>Gaiety,</HI> and grow <HI>in Love</HI> with his Good
<HI>Breeding!</HI> Yet, Five Parts in Six, I doubt, of all that
<HI>Admi|ration</HI> which has been paid to the&s;e inimitable 
<PB N="89" REF="90"> <HI>Flights</HI> of <HI>Genius,</HI> is
<HI>Implicite,</HI> and <HI>mere Ac|cident:</HI> For there are

<HI>Heaven</HI> vouch&s;afes <HI>a Vi&s;it</HI> to!</P>
<P>I HAVE been &s;hewn an EPITAPH lately, which is &s;aid to have
been written by this <HI>Gentleman,</HI> for the <HI>Tomb</HI> of a Friend of
his: The Thought, on which it turns, is very happy, and extreamly
Natural.&mdash;It has been publi&s;h'd, in &s;ome of our
<HI>Weekly-Papers</HI>; but not &s;o full as I here give it.</P>
<Q> 
<L>To this &s;ad Shrine, whoe're thou art, draw near,</L> 
<L>Here lies the <HI>FRIEND,</HI> mo&s;t wept, the <HI>SON</HI>
mo&s;t <HI>dear,</HI></L> 
<L>Who ne'er knew <HI>Joy,</HI> but <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> might

<L>How vain is Rea&s;on! Eloquence, how weak!</L> 
<L>When <HI>POPE</HI> mu&s;t tell, what <HI>HARCOURT cannot

<L>Yet, <HI>Let</HI> thy once lov'd <HI>Friend</HI> in&s;cribe thy

<L>Ah, no! 'tis vain to &s;trive&mdash;It <HI>will not be.</HI></L>

<L>No Grief, that <HI>can</HI> be <HI>told,</HI> is felt for
<HI>THEE!</HI></L></Q>
<P>THE <HI>Manu&s;cripts,</HI> of this fine EPITAPH, which are handed
about Town, have, already, <HI>various Readings:</HI> And in &s;ome, the two
la&s;t Lines are wholly omitted. But, I can never &s;uppo&s;e a Ca&s;tration,
of that <HI>Importance, Ge|nuine</HI>; becau&s;e the <HI>Clo&s;e,</HI> at the
fir&s;t Break, has a Strength, &s;o full, and di&s;tingui&s;h'd, that 
<PB N="90" REF="91"> it left an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, for a vigorous Turn
of Thought, in the Conclu&s;ion of that which follows it: Whereas nothing could
ap|pear more languid, and unequal to its Au|thor, than to have ended, after
&s;o <HI>fine</HI> a <HI>Stroke,</HI> with &s;aying no more, than this: <HI>Let
your Friend write your Epitaph; and tell the World, that he is as &s;orry for
your Death, as your Father is.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE not, I think, at home, read any Piece, of this Kind, more
&s;triking, and &s;trongly rais'd upon the <HI>Force</HI> of its touching
<HI>Simplicity!</HI> But I remember to have &s;een two <HI>Epitaphs,</HI> both,
<HI>Foreign</HI>; which gave me a Delight, of the &s;ame Nature.&mdash;I
&s;hall tran&s;late them, as near I can, into <HI>Eng|li&s;h.</HI> This,
fir&s;t, is by a <HI>French Poet,</HI> on the Death of <HI>Cardinal
Richlieu:</HI> And has in it, a certain Mixture of the <HI>Great,</HI> the
<HI>Natural,</HI> and the <HI>Surprizing,</HI> which is very rarely to be met
with.</P>
<Q> 
<L><HI>Stay, Traveller!&mdash;for, All you want, is near,</HI></L> 
<L>Wi&s;dom, and Power, I &s;eek.&mdash;<HI>They, both, lie
here.</HI></L> 
<L>Nay, but I look for more, and rai&s;e my Aim,</L> 
<L>To Wit, Ta&s;te, Learning, Elegance, and Fame.</L> 
<L><HI>Here ends your Journey, then: For, here, the STORE</HI></L> 
<L><HI>Of</HI> RICHLIE&V; <HI>lies.</HI>&mdash;Alas! repeat no
more.</L> 
<L>Shame on my Pride! What Hope is left, for Me,</L> 
<L>When, here, Death treads on All, that Man can be.</L></Q>
<P>THE Second, which now follows, is of <HI>Spani&s;h Original</HI>;
and was the <HI>Epitaph</HI> <PB N="91" REF="92"> of a beautiful Neice of the
Famous <HI>Oli|varez.</HI></P>
<Q>

<L>Her <HI>Name,</HI> who&s;e Charms enrich the Du&s;t below;</L> 
<L>Point up, and bid 'em read:&mdash;But, &s;ay no more:</L> 
<L>Nor &s;trive, in vain, to count her <HI>Vertues</HI> o'er.</L> 
<L>Scarce cou'd the &s;weet Amount be ju&s;tly &s;ung,</L>

<P>WHERE there is Ju&s;tne&s;s, and Propriety, in the&s;e
<HI>Rays</HI> and <HI>Beamings</HI> of the <HI>Wit,</HI> they break out upon
our <HI>Fancy,</HI> with irre&s;i&s;table Force and Lu&s;tre! We are often
dazzled, for a Moment, even with the fal&s;e Imitation of it, where the
<HI>proper Sence</HI> is mingled, and confounded with the
<HI>Metaphorical.</HI> But we no &s;ooner examine it, clo&s;ely, than the
Coun|terfeit Colours vani&s;h, and we de&s;pi&s;e our own, and the
<HI>Poet</HI>'s <HI>Weakne&s;s:</HI> Whereas, when the Thought is
<HI>ju&s;t,</HI> as well as <HI>&s;hining</HI>; when it is founded on Truth, in
Nature, and only rai&s;es our Admiration by its Grandeur, Grace, and
Noblene&s;s, the Heat, contracted, and pointed &s;trong, upon a near, and
&s;ingle, Center, inflames and catches, like a <HI>Burning Gla&s;s</HI>; and
Stocks and Stones, are melted down by it, almo&s;t as &s;uddenly as Gold and
Silver.</P>
<P>IT were a Work of General U&s;e, and no unplea&s;ant
Entertainment, to make a <HI>Mu|&s;ter</HI> of tho&s;e Fal&s;e
<HI>Thoughts,</HI> or affected <HI>Turns</HI> of <HI>Wit,</HI> and pa&s;s 'em,
in <HI>Review,</HI> <PB N="92" REF="93"> oppos'd to &s;uch, as are True and
Solid.&mdash;The Common <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> would &s;tand corrected, and con&s;ent
to give up their <HI>Favourites</HI>; for Few can want Good Sen&s;e to
di&s;tingu&s;h, when they &s;ee 'em together; and mark, that <HI>Truth,</HI>
(which is Nature repre&s;ented exactly as &s;he appears) is the <HI>Life</HI>
and <HI>Soul,</HI> of Thinking; and <HI>Greatne&s;s, Delicacy,</HI> and

<P>THE black <HI>Eyes</HI> of the <HI>Spani&s;h Ladies,</HI> have a

<HI>Sonnet</HI> is a <HI>Ma&s;ter|piece,</HI> of its Kind, and may de&s;erve to
&s;tand as an <HI>Example</HI> of that <HI>Fal&s;e Wit</HI> above-mention'd: As
con&s;i&s;ting, chiefly, of contra|dictory <HI>Idea's,</HI> which are forc'd
together, like <HI>Oil,</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> by the Violence of the
Writer's <HI>Fancy</HI>; but &s;eperate, and di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, as

<P><PB N="93" REF="94">BUT tho' &s;uch <HI>Turns</HI> as

is &s;o full of <HI>Point,</HI> yet, it bears, without <HI>dimi|ni&s;hing,</HI>
every <HI>Light</HI> that it can be view'd in.&mdash;I will give both the

<P>THERE is &s;omething too, of an elevated Smartne&s;s, and that
will bear the nice&s;t Exa|mination, in the <HI>Thought</HI> of a <HI>French

<SALUTE>Dear SLAVY!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> AT la&s;t, this &s;weet Town, which mu&s;t for ever hold my
Heart, has again Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my <HI>Per&s;on.</HI>&mdash;I left
<HI>Tunbridge,</HI> a Hundred Years ago; and went a Pilgri|mage, in pure
Compa&s;&s;ion, to vi&s;it a poor Thing, in <HI>Marriage Trammels</HI>: Where I
have &s;tuck fa&s;t, ever &s;ince, in the <HI>Dirt</HI> of your Dear
<HI>Su&s;&s;ex.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="99"> WELL! tho' I have but half forgiven you,
for &s;etting That <HI>breathing Whirligig, Ned Volatile,</HI> upon me; yet, I
think, I am as much in <HI>Love</HI> with <HI>You,</HI> as with any of your
<HI>Rival Candidates</HI> for the <HI>Place</HI> I have to di&s;po&s;e
of.&mdash;But, if ever I marry you, there is <HI>One Thing,</HI> I mu&s;t
po&s;itively <HI>in&s;i&s;t on.</HI>&mdash;You &s;hall keep me <HI>two
Chairs,</HI> and a <HI>Chariot.</HI>&mdash;I had &s;carce a <HI>Scruple</HI> of
Brains, in my Head, all la&s;t Week: For, after rumbling up, in a
<HI>Stage-Coach,</HI> I was <HI>pound|ed to Death,</HI> from the dreadful
<HI>Borough,</HI> to <HI>Park-Place,</HI> in an odious <HI>Hackney
Mortar.</HI>&mdash;You have <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> I know, at your Finger's Ends:
Pray &s;end me the <HI>Name</HI> of that Tragical <HI>Roman</HI> Tumbler, who
was barrell'd up, by the <HI>Carthaginians</HI>; and roll'd, a Mile or two,
down Hill, in a <HI>Butt,</HI> &s;tuck full of <HI>Ten-penny-Nails?</HI>
Methinks, I pity him, from my Heart! For, I could not help thinking, while I
was bouncing up and down, in my Vehicle, like a Thim|ble full of Shot, in a
Quart Bottle, That my own <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> was as bad as <HI>His.</HI> At
lea&s;t, if there was any Difference, it lay only in a few <HI>Points,</HI>
which I had rather give up, than <HI>&s;tand upon.</HI></P>
<P> <HI>HEAVEN</HI> have Mercy on tho&s;e poor <HI>Citizens
Wives,</HI> who, when their hideous <HI>Bedfellows</HI> have made them too
<HI>big,</HI> to be able to <HI>go,</HI> are forc'd to be <HI>carried,</HI> in
the&s;e Town Tumbrels.&mdash;'Tis well I was not cho&s;e for a <HI>Knight of
the Shire,</HI> at our la&s;t <PB N="99" REF="100"> Election! The Rogues, who
contriv'd the&s;e <HI>Bolting Hutches,</HI> to &s;ift Peoples Bones thro their

to reach them: I would have got an ACT <HI>pa&s;&s;ed, on pur|po&s;e,</HI> to
have the Mon&s;ters <HI>gallop'd to Death,</HI> in their own unmerciful
<HI>Torturing Boxes.</HI></P>
<P> COME, and drink <HI>TEA</HI> with me To|morrow. I know you
don't love to be <HI>look'd at:</HI> And to humour that very out-o'the-way
<HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> of yours, we will be as Retir'd, as two Snails in a

Ogle,</HI> and <HI>Gatty Go&s;ling,</HI> and dear Lady <HI>Frightall,</HI> and
Mi&s;s <HI>Jumper,</HI> and <HI>Jack Scarecrow</HI>; and <HI>Jack,</HI> you

had a <HI>Misfortune,</HI> &s;ince I went to <HI>Tunbridge:</HI> And
<HI>Fanny</HI> is a <HI>Prude,</HI> that has &s;toop'd as low as
<HI>Matrimony.</HI>&mdash;I long to &s;ee how they look, after the Accidents
that have befallen them.&mdash;Don't, <HI>fail</HI> at your Peril, for we want
your Sage <HI>Advice,</HI> about a <HI>Project,</HI> that is newly come into
our Heads; and I &s;hall never be at Re&s;t, 'till I know, what you think of
it.</P>
<P> THE Bu&s;ine&s;s, in one Word, is <HI>Free|dom: WOMAN's
Freedom.</HI>&mdash;For, &s;ure! if <HI>Men,</HI> who are born to be

<HI>Rea&s;on</HI> to know, that <HI>we</HI> can't want
<HI>Authority.</HI>&mdash;So, the Thing it &s;elf is pa&s;t Di&s;pute;
<HI>we</HI> have <HI>decreed, to take Government upon us:</HI> But the
<HI>Que&s;tion</HI> is, Under what <HI>Name,</HI> or <HI>Title,</HI> we &s;hall
ex|erci&s;e it.</P>
<P> WE are told, by an Experienc'd <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> who is
<HI>&s;ole, Chamber Coun&s;el,</HI> to an Emi|nent <HI>Coun&s;ellor, at
Law,</HI> that the Word <HI>Par|liament</HI> will be too Bold and Ardent for
our <HI>Purpo&s;e.</HI> And yet if another of our Mem|bers, who is Learned in
<HI>Law French,</HI> be but as good at <HI>Derivation,</HI> as &s;he has always
been at <HI>Di&s;putation, She</HI> will have <HI>Parlia|ment</HI> to
&s;ignifie <HI>Prattlement</HI>; and in that Ca&s;e, who doubts, but we might
make good our <HI>Preten&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P> HOWEVER, let it go. We aim at No|thing, but our <HI>ju&s;t
Prerogative;</HI> nor have any De&s;ign, in the lea&s;t, again&s;t the
<HI>Privi|leges</HI> of the <HI>other Hou&s;es</HI>; who&s;e Members, for any

are.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102">YET, it were certainly no harder upon the
<HI>Men,</HI> That the <HI>Women</HI> &s;hould u&s;urp <HI>their Offices,</HI>
than it is mortifying to us <HI>Women,</HI> to &s;ee the <HI>Men</HI>

That there are Male-Members, of more Hou&s;es than One, <HI>ungallant</HI>
enough to in|vade us, in our very <HI>E&s;&s;entials?</HI>&mdash;Some can
<HI>Dance,</HI> as well as we can; &s;ome (tho' Fewer indeed) can even

not to a&s;&s;ume a <HI>Title,</HI> becau&s;e the Nation has, already
be&s;tow'd it on <HI>Our Repre&s;en|tatives?</HI> What were the

where none of our <HI>Sex</HI> are permitted to &s;it, and vote, for
<HI>Us?</HI> Is this <HI>Free Government?</HI> Is this to be &s;ubject to no

an Air, too <HI>Mo|therly,</HI> and would <HI>&s;it hard,</HI> upon Youth, and
Gaiety.&mdash;It was next mov'd, That a <HI>Commitee</HI> of <HI>Virgin
Elders</HI> &s;hou'd be &s;ent, as far as <HI>Poland,</HI> to borrow and bring
Home, the U&s;e of the Word <HI>DIET.&mdash;Kitty Hoyden</HI> leapt out of our

&s;he &s;aid, That <HI>Poli&s;h Diets</HI> are often &s;um|mon'd to meet,
<HI>on Hor&s;eback</HI>; and &s;he was po&s;itive, That no People could ride,
more Learnedly, than the <HI>Hor&s;e-women</HI> of our Country. She added, That

that too, &s;he &s;aw no Rea&s;on, why an <HI>Engli&s;h Woman</HI> might not

<P>WHEN I was Young, I remember, among many other <HI>Follies,</HI> I

form'd my <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> of <HI>Stile,</HI> upon <HI>Cicero</HI>; and treated
the <HI>Commentaries</HI> of <HI>Cae|&s;ar</HI> with an Extraordinary Air of

<P>I HAD not learnt to con&s;ider, That there is a Difference, in the

The Ri&s;e and Fall of his <HI>Voice, in&s;inuating, &s;oftening, accu&s;ing,

Divi&s;ions,</HI> and <HI>Etimolo|gies,</HI> take up the greate&s;t Part of his
<HI>Work.</HI> There is <HI>Life</HI> indeed, and <HI>noble Life!</HI> but it
is &s;mother'd in the dre&s;&s;ing. When I have &s;pent an Hour, in reading
him, I recollect <PB N="109" REF="110"> what <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> I have
gather'd from him; and find, for the mo&s;t Part, I have got no|thing but
<HI>Wind:</HI> He is not, <HI>yet,</HI> come far enough, to be Enter'd upon his
<HI>Rea&s;ons.</HI>&mdash;Now, for <HI>Me,</HI> who only de&s;ire to be
<HI>Wi&s;e,</HI> not <HI>Eloquent,</HI> I wou'd read nothing, but what is to
the <HI>Purpo&s;e.</HI>&mdash;I know well enough, without being told, What is
<HI>meant,</HI> by <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Plea&s;ure:</HI> Why then do they
give them|&s;elves the Trouble of <HI>Anatomi&s;ing</HI> them? I am for
<HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Argument,</HI> at the fir&s;t Da&s;h, and wou'd be
in&s;tructed how to <HI>with|&s;tand,</HI> rather than <HI>talk quaintly
of,</HI> my Pa&s;&s;ions. I am for Charging at once, into the Heart of the
Doubt, and not Approaching it, by Way of <HI>Siege,</HI> with Logical
<HI>Lines,</HI> and <HI>Trenches.</HI>&mdash;The Subjects of <HI>Cicero</HI>
langui&s;h, by his De|laying our Expectation. His Way was very well for the
<HI>Bar,</HI>; or might do, perhaps, for the <HI>Pulpit</HI>; and &s;ince 'tis
&s;o common to <HI>Nod,</HI> at a <HI>Sermon,</HI> Men, in this Ca&s;e, might
have Lei&s;ure to <HI>take a Nap,</HI> and wake, a Quarter of an Hour after,
Time enough to find the Thread of the <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e.</HI> Men may &s;peak,
in this Manner to <HI>Children,</HI> or to <HI>ignorant People:</HI> But I can
never be made Attentive, by an Author's Elocution, where his <HI>Matter</HI> is
too weak to hold me.</Q>
<P>BEFORE I had the Cood Fortune to meet with this Cen&s;ure, (which
carries with it no more <HI>Boldne&s;s,</HI> than <HI>Rea&s;on</HI>) I had
ventur'd to appear, in <HI>Print,</HI> and &s;ent &s;ome <HI>Treati&s;es</HI>
into the World, which I have never thought <PB N="110" REF="111"> of, from that
Time forward, without blu&s;h|ing at my Con&s;cious Weakne&s;s, in the
Affe|ctation of a <HI>Stile,</HI> &s;o <HI>Wordy,</HI> that it moves my own
Indignation, very &s;trongly, again&s;t my &s;elf, for what I have, formerly
con&s;ider'd, as no &s;mall Part of my <HI>Merit.</HI></P>
<P>IF my <HI>own Works</HI> were of Importance enough, I wou'd
<HI>light 'em up,</HI> as a <HI>Beacon,</HI> to warn Others of the Danger: But,
&s;ince That <HI>Honour</HI> is more than they de&s;erve, I di&s;claim it, with
due Mode&s;ty; and will borrow an Example, of like Nature, from an Author of
more Dignity.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman, I mean, is a Reverend and Learned
<HI>Profe&s;&s;or:</HI> In who&s;e <HI>Preface,</HI> to an excellent
Tran&s;lation of <HI>Virgil,</HI> we are told, after, at lea&s;t, as much
<HI>In&s;truction,</HI> as cou'd, <HI>rea&s;onably,</HI> have been expected,
That <HI>He has, not, yet done with us: For &s;omething, more, &s;till,
remains, behind.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, tho' much may be &s;aid, for this Gentleman's
<HI>Genero&s;ity,</HI> from the Profu&s;ion of his De&s;ire to
<HI>&s;atisfy</HI> us; yet a le&s;s Degree of Prai&s;e will be &s;ufficient,
for his <HI>Di&s;cretion:</HI> Since it was not kind enough to whi&s;per in his
Ear, that He, who tells us the &s;ame Thing, <HI>Six Times over,</HI> will
rather provoke us to <HI>Indignation</HI> than to <HI>Gratitude</HI>; becau&s;e
it argues an Opinion in him, That he is talking to Per&s;ons, who have a
<HI>Deafne&s;s,</HI> in their Under&s;tanding.&mdash;When he had a&s;&s;ur'd
us, <HI>He had not yet done,</HI> There cou'd be no Rea|&s;on in the World, but
the over-obliging Li|berality <PB N="111" REF="112"> of his <HI>Rhetorick,</HI>
to take the Trou|ble of adding, that <HI>There was &s;omething more:</HI> Much
le&s;s, That there was <HI>&s;omething more, &s;till!</HI>&mdash;But, when he
goes on, with &s;o unhop'd! &s;o unexpected! a Flow of Boun|ty, as to add, That
there was <HI>&s;omething, more, &s;till, that remain'd,</HI> The Obligation
was <HI>enforc'd</HI> to &s;o &s;urprizing a Height, that it mu&s;t have been
judg'd Impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e it more, if we had not found, immediately
after, That not only <HI>&s;omething, more, &s;till, remain'd,</HI> but, that
it <HI>remain'd, behind,</HI> al&s;o!</P>
<P>I COU'D wi&s;h to &s;ee it e&s;tabli&s;h'd, as a Rule among
<HI>Writers,</HI> That every Word &s;hould be a Fault, which, being taken out
of a <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> left no <HI>Void</HI> in the <HI>Sen&s;e:</HI>
For, to what End &s;hou'd we u&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, which may be cut off,
without <HI>Maiming,</HI> or let &s;tand, without <HI>Beauty?</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Pen of One, who attempts to write <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI>
happens to be thus, <HI>drop&s;ically,</HI> di&s;po&s;ed, He never fails to
drown his <HI>Facts,</HI> in a Deluge of <HI>Affectation.</HI>&mdash;We have
then, long <HI>Speeches</HI> of great Generals, made to their Armies, in Line
of Battle, and ju&s;t on the Point of Engagement; In which the mon&s;trous
Ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a Time fit for formal Harangues, or that
they could be Audible to the Hundredth Part of the Numbers they are addre&s;s'd
to, is not &s;ufficient to deter the&s;e Orators from di&s;play|ing all their
<HI>Tropes,</HI> with &s;o much Fullne&s;s and Variety, that, when the Armies
come to <PB N="112" REF="113"> <HI>Charge,</HI> the Hi&s;torian has not Spirits
enough left him, (after the Fatigue of his <HI>War of Eloquence</HI>) to
ob&s;erve, or explain to us, How the Battle, it &s;elf, was formed, and fought;
or by what Conduct, on one &s;ide, or Mi|&s;take, on the other, The Fortune of
the Day delcared in Favour of the <HI>Victorious.</HI></P>
<P><HI>TACITUS,</HI> of all Hi&s;torians, was lea&s;t guilty of
u&s;ing Wordine&s;s, or Circumlocu|tion, in his Relations.&mdash;On the
contrary, when he errs, it is in the much nobler Ex|tream, of too Rich, and
Delicate an Exce&s;s of <HI>Sen&s;e.</HI>&mdash;He refines not on
<HI>Words,</HI> but on <HI>Things</HI>; he <HI>&s;peaks</HI> le&s;s for his
Great Per&s;ons, than They <HI>&s;poke,</HI> for Them&s;elves: But he
<HI>thinks</HI> for them much more delicately than it is probable <HI>They</HI>
ever thought.&mdash;When <HI>Gal|gacus,</HI> at the Head of his
<HI>Britons,</HI> is about to charge the <HI>Roman</HI> Army, what Number of
Eloquent Pages could have in&s;pired his Followers with Reflections, more apt
to in|flame them with Heroick Sentiments, than what He <HI>fla&s;h</HI>'d upon
their Imaginations, in this comprehen&s;ive Encouragement.&mdash;<HI>Fall on,
my Friends, and, in the</HI> Shock, <HI>think of your ANCESTORS, and your
POSTE|RITY!</HI></P>
<P>ANTIQUITY can &s;carce produce an In|&s;tance of more
per&s;wa&s;ive Eloquence, than This <HI>Oration, in a &s;ingle
Sentence!</HI>&mdash;But I have the Plea&s;ure to &s;ee, before me, the Speech
of a <HI>Modern Leader,</HI> which, as it had an End very different, &s;o its
Influence was <PB N="113" REF="114"> much more
powerful.&mdash;<HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and many Generals, before, and after him,
in&s;pired <HI>faint-hearted Followers, with Courage:</HI> But This is the only
In&s;tance, I have ever met with, of a Commander, who had Rhetorick enough to
<HI>talk Brave Fellows, into Cowardice.</HI></P>
<P>THE Hero of our Story (which is, &s;in|cerely, a <HI>true</HI>
one) was at his Studies, in One of the Univer&s;ities of a Neighbour-Nation,
when the late Rebellion broke out, and allarmed the Care of the Government. He
was Young, and de&s;igned for a Pillar of his <HI>Mother Kirk.</HI>&mdash;Grace
and Sanctity, had there|fore, been more in his Thoughts, than Arms, and
Slaughter: But &s;ome of his Friends, who claimed a Power in rai&s;ing, and
di&s;po|&s;ing, the <HI>Militia,</HI> took a Fancy to dignify the young
<HI>Kirkman,</HI> with the Command of a <HI>Company,</HI> and gave him Orders
to march them to a <HI>Rendezvous,</HI> that was appointed, a few Days
after.</P>
<P>THE <HI>New Captain</HI> (as He tells the Story, Him&s;elf, with a
great Deal of Humour, and Frankne&s;s) thought <HI>Safety</HI> more his
Bu&s;ine&s;s than <HI>Valour:</HI> Yet was a&s;hamed to appear Fearful, when
Every Body, round him, look|ed as big, as a <HI>Bajazet.</HI>&mdash;He
re&s;olved, there|fore, To have Recour&s;e to his <HI>Oratory,</HI> and try, if
it was not po&s;&s;ible, under Pretence of <HI>Encouraging</HI> his Men, to
frighten them into <HI>De&s;ertion.</HI>&mdash;In Pur&s;uance of this Hope, He
drew them on the Morning appointed for the March, into a Ring, at the Foot of a
little <PB N="114" REF="115"> Mount; and, placing him&s;elf on the Top of it,
addre&s;&s;ed them in the following Ora|tion; which he gave me, in his own
Hand-Writing:</P>

who&s;e Lot it will be, to <HI>Fall,</HI> in the Field of Slaughter? And,

<P>AMONG the Beauties of Magnanimi|ty, there is none, of a nobler
Quality, than the Power of <HI>forgiving Injuries.</HI>&mdash;It throws a
Maje&s;ty over the <HI>Mind,</HI> and illu&s;trates the <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> with
an Air of Sweetne&s;s, and Serenity.&mdash;We ought the more to admire it,
&s;ince, where-ever it is found, It is in Com|pany with the <HI>Sublime&s;t
Virtues:</HI> There not being <HI>Room</HI> for it, in a narrow, vulgar,
<HI>Soul</HI>; becau&s;e, overfill'd with Little Senti|ments, &s;uch as have
their Ri&s;e, and Revolu|tion, within the Circle of
<HI>Self-Intere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Brutal Pa&s;&s;ion of REVENGE, and a malicious Memory, for
<HI>Mi&s;chief,</HI> is become &s;o Shamele&s;s, and Licentious, that it is
com|mon to hear Re&s;olutions of retain'd Malice avow'd, coldly, and in general
Expre&s;&s;ions, Such as, <HI>Setting upon People's Skirts,&mdash;Finding a
Time to be Even with them,</HI>&mdash;and the like malignant, &s;illy,
Phra&s;es, whereby the Burn|ings <PB N="125" REF="126"> of an inward Hatred
&s;eem to &s;truggle, for Eruption.</P>
<P>METHINKS, a &s;ufficient Fortification, again&s;t &s;o abject a
Frailty, might be drawn from &s;uch Natural Reflections, as
The&s;e;&mdash;That, <HI>In violently returning Wrongs,</HI> we do Nothing but
what <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> can do, more rea|dily.&mdash;That, in <HI>Malice,</HI>
the mo&s;t Exalted <HI>Noble,</HI> is but on a Level with the Lowe&s;t
<HI>Slave:</HI> Whereas, to <HI>Pardon,</HI> is an Act of <HI>Sovereignty</HI>;
and, however <HI>Inferior</HI> we were, <HI>before,</HI> to the Per&s;on, who
has injured us, From the Moment, in which we <HI>forgive him,</HI> we exchange
Conditions, and become <HI>Su|perior.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, &s;ince many, who have no Ambition to be thought Men of
<HI>Virtue,</HI> would, yet, gladly, be e&s;teemed <HI>Wi&s;e,</HI> It may be
an Ar|gument, of more <HI>Per&s;wa&s;ion,</HI> That This Propen&s;ity to
<HI>Revenge</HI> is a Mark, not of <HI>Mean-Spiritedne&s;s</HI> only, but of
<HI>Ignorance.</HI>&mdash;The Man of Knowledge can never be enough &s;urpriz'd,
at Common Wrongs, to be inflam'd into a Re&s;entment, either too Malicious, or
too Violent.&mdash;His Wi&s;dom has in&s;tructed him, That where-ever we find
<HI>Men,</HI> we &s;hall be &s;ure to find <HI>Injuries:</HI> And, That there
is a Nece&s;&s;ity of its being &s;o, from the incompa|tible, and oppo&s;ite,
Wills, Humours, and Intere&s;ts, among Mankind.</P>
<P>SHOU'D the Treacherous, the Su&s;picious, the Covetous, the

<PB N="126" REF="127"> could have expected, from their Natures, we might be
ju&s;tified, in our <HI>Wonder</HI> at it.&mdash;But, why &s;hould we expre&s;s
Amazement at what it was natural for us to depend on? Why be <HI>Angry</HI>
with the <HI>Incon&s;iderable?</HI>&mdash;Mo&s;t of Tho&s;e, who provoke, and
offend us, de&s;erve rather our Grief, and Pity; For They are no more in their
own Hands, than a <HI>Mad|man,</HI> or an <HI>Ideot,</HI> is: And we make a
poorer Figure than our Pride allows us to <HI>believe,</HI> when we di&s;quiet
our &s;elves, on &s;uch weak Motives.&mdash;When a <HI>Fool</HI> throws a
<HI>Straw</HI> at us, It were to &s;eem <HI>light,</HI> to feel the Weight of
it: And <HI>He</HI> will never enjoy <HI>Re&s;t,</HI> who is not Ma&s;ter of
Re&s;olution to <HI>forgive</HI> All Tho&s;e Injuries, which his Honour, or his
Safety, does not <HI>compel</HI> him to defend him&s;elf again&s;t.</P>
<P>NEITHER is there only a Wi&s;dom, and a Noblene&s;s;&mdash;There
is &s;omething, too, of a generous <HI>Courage,</HI> in a Heart, that is above
the Reach of the&s;e vindictive Impre&s;|&s;ions.&mdash;The Levity, that is
&s;hewn, in be|ing moved, at every Trifle, carries with it an Air of

<P><PB N="127" REF="128">THERE is a &s;ingle, heroick, <HI>Word,</HI>

Puni&s;hment,</HI> which &s;ordid Natures would have u&s;ed, with
Gree|dine&s;s, to the De&s;truction of the Man they hated,
<HI>re&s;trained,</HI> and <HI>temper'd,</HI> His Re&s;ent|ment!&mdash;He

<HI>You have e&s;caped, by my becoming your MASTER, the Vengeance which you
&s;hould have felt, from me, had, I continued, but, your EQUAL.&mdash;That</HI>
ADRIAN <HI>is, now, no more, from whom you could not have expected Mercy; And
This</HI> ADRIAN, <HI>who gives you Pardon, owes Com|pa&s;&s;ion to His

Injuries</HI>!</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible, but a Collection of &s;uch amiable Examples
as This, enforced, by &s;ome per&s;wa&s;ive Pen, mu&s;t work &s;trongly upon
the Minds of Men, not depraved into utter Ta&s;tle&s;sne&s;s: For, by
&s;triking, even, <HI>Little Hearts,</HI> with a clear Conviction, That the
<HI>Precept</HI> contains Nothing, but what has been exceeded in the
<HI>Practice,</HI> It would leave them no Pretence for Eva&s;ion; and
in&s;inuate, by a gradual Progre&s;s, out of their Memory, into their
Imitation.</P>
<P>BUT Nothing furni&s;hes more Occa&s;ion for Surprize, and
Indignation, than to ob|&s;erve our Places of Publick Wor&s;hip, filled with
<HI>Out&s;ide Formali&s;ts,</HI> of all Ranks, and of both Sexes; who, either
with an impious <HI>Hypocri&s;y,</HI> or a <HI>Stupidity,</HI> as dark as
<HI>Ideoti&s;m,</HI> affront the Maje&s;ty of Heaven, by petition|ing
<HI>GOD</HI>'s <HI>Pardon,&mdash;as They, Them&s;elves, pardon Others.</HI>
While, at the very Moment <PB N="129" REF="130"> of their Kneeling, in this
empty Mockery of Devotion, It is known, to one Half the Congregation, That the
Hearts of the other Half are imbitter'd with malicious Purpo&s;es, and glowing
with a painful Re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, till they can be revenged, for, &s;ome
&s;light Indig|nity.&mdash;Could The&s;e People have a Sen&s;e of the
Signification of the Words they utter, They would tremble at the Apprehen&s;ion
of having What they pray for, <HI>granted, literally</HI>; and the Mercy of
That dreadful GOD they dare to trifle with, <HI>refu&s;ed,</HI> to their
Unwor|thine&s;s, till they have learnt as readily to <HI>for|give,</HI> as to
<HI>pray to be forgiven.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e &s;everer Arguments, which might be
drawn from <HI>Grace,</HI> and <HI>Vir|tue,</HI> There is <HI>One,</HI> which
<HI>mu&s;t</HI> be welcome; becau&s;e we, all, agree to <HI>love
our&s;elves;</HI> and no Enemy is &s;o Trouble&s;ome, as <HI>Malice</HI> to our
<HI>Pride,</HI> our <HI>Health,</HI> and our <HI>Quiet.</HI>&mdash;We &s;ubmit
our &s;elves, by this unmanly Pa&s;&s;ion, to the Humours of the Men we
hate.&mdash;We empower them to afflict, and mortifie, us.&mdash;At the Sight of
a Per&s;on, again&s;t whom we meditate Revenge, our Spirits undergo a
Tempe&s;t: And, even when he is ab&s;ent, our Memory goads, and tortures
us.&mdash;Our very Dreams become imbitter'd, and confound our <HI>Re&s;t,</HI>
with our <HI>Di&s;quiet.</HI>&mdash;We wi&s;h the Evil to Another; but we
in|flict it on our Selves: And, contrary to our own Intention, become
<HI>Patients,</HI> where we de&s;ign to be <HI>Agents.</HI>&mdash;The Revenger
lives <PB N="130" REF="131"> in Torment, and He, on whom He would be revenged,
is at Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is a grinding, gnawing, Pa&s;&s;ion, that preys inward, upon
the Heart, and mi&s;takes the <HI>Means</HI> of its own
<HI>Purpo&s;e.</HI>&mdash;What Triumph can <HI>Revenge</HI> afford us, but from
a Reflexion, That the Per&s;on puni&s;hed, repents, and wi&s;hes the Wrong
unacted? This End can never be obtain'd by <HI>Mi&s;chiefs</HI>; for, by
provoking <HI>new</HI> Malice, they make the Me|mory of the <HI>old</HI>
delightful: But it may be nobly effected, by a&s;toni&s;hing, di&s;gracing, and
confounding an Enemy, with <HI>Benefits</HI> in re|turn for his
<HI>Demerit.</HI> And This is what the mo&s;t Venerable of all Books very
&s;trongly ex|pre&s;&s;es, by <HI>heaping Coals of Fire, on His Head:</HI> That
is, It burns, and wounds, his Imagina|tion, with a con&s;cious Shame, at his
<HI>Inferior Figure,</HI> while He &s;ees him&s;elf di&s;graced, by Services
from That Per&s;on, of all the World, whom he lea&s;t de&s;erved to be obliged
by!&mdash;The &s;tubborn Virtue of <HI>CATO,</HI> would have allowed him to
&s;ubmit to <HI>CAESAR</HI>; but that his <HI>Pride</HI> was more afraid of a

the Great and Shining Characters, which have made Anti|quity Illu&s;trious,
have been &s;o far from &s;toop|ing, to indulge <HI>Revenge,</HI> that, on the

<P><HI>MAHOMET</HI> the IId, That victorious <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>
Emperor, who took <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> from the Chri&s;tians, had a very
great Genius for Poetry, and was &s;o warm in its Encourage|ment, that He is
reported to have offer'd Re|wards, for every <HI>Fault,</HI> that cou'd be
pointed out, in the Works of his <HI>Court Poets,</HI> and made Good again&s;t
the Arguments, which &s;hou'd be brought, in Favour of the Defendants.</P>
<P>HEAVEN be prais'd, That His Maje&s;ty of <HI>GREAT BRITAIN</HI>
has no &s;uch partial Opinion of the Poets of our Age, and Coun|try! Such a
Proclamation wou'd drain his Exchequer, more effectually than a Ten Years
<HI>War,</HI> with the &s;tronge&s;t Power of <HI>Europe!</HI></P>
<P>BUT, I believe, we may live at Ea&s;e: The Encouragement of the
Poet's Art, in this pre&s;ent Generation, will occa&s;ion no Pro|fu&s;ene&s;s,
that can be dangerous to the Reve|nue. <PB N="135" REF="136"> And, as for our
<HI>Great Men,</HI> They are <HI>Patrons,</HI> for the mo&s;t Part, as They are
<HI>Doctors,</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ters of Art,</HI> rather by Acci|dent, than by
Purpo&s;e; and think them&s;elves under no Obligation to <HI>pay for</HI>
Compliments which their Con&s;cience tells them, They have <HI>No Right
to.</HI></P>
<P>THE Truth is, when Any Thing, &s;o Ex|traordinary, falls out, as,
That A Man of Quality is Witty Him&s;elf, and an Encou|rager of Wit, in Others;
The Poets are &s;o Unmerciful, in their A&s;&s;aults on his Libe|rality, That
His Equals, in Dignity, have found much Safety and Comfort, in the Fame of
<HI>Dullne&s;s.</HI> And there never was a livelier Proof of the Soundne&s;s of
That Common Maxim, that <HI>Hone&s;ty is the be&s;t Policy</HI>; than the
Succe&s;s of the fa&s;hionable Expedient, (at once &s;o frank, and &s;o
ingenious!) of return|ing the Dedicator's Gilt Book, with this &s;hort Apology
for not accepting it&mdash;<HI>My Lord gives his Service, and &s;ays, He does
not UNDERSTAND the&s;e Matters.</HI></P>
<P>FOR Want of &s;ome &s;uch dext'rous <HI>Stroke of Art,</HI> The
Grandees, of That <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperor's Court, whom I nam'd, at the Head
of my Paper, were, often, reduc'd to a <HI>Nonplus.</HI> It was, particularly,
the Ca&s;e of <HI>Ali-Ba&s;ha,</HI> His Favourite <HI>Trea&s;urer.</HI> He had
learnt to <HI>Read,</HI> and <HI>ca&s;t Accompts</HI>; But <HI>Wit</HI> being
<HI>out of his Way,</HI> He had one, regular, Method of re|warding All who
addre&s;s'd their Writings to Him: He put the Book into one Scale, and 
<PB N="136" REF="137"> dropt Gold into another, and, having <HI>adju&s;ted the
Balance,</HI> gave the <HI>Weight</HI> of the Work, as a Gratuity, to the
Author.&mdash;The wor&s;t Effect of this General Rule was, That it was common
for the <HI>lighte&s;t Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> to bring with them the
<HI>heavie&s;t Bindings.</HI> There was nothing, more <HI>Sub&s;tantial</HI>
than the <HI>Covers</HI> of this Great Patron's Books!&mdash;But one Poet,
above the Re&s;t, had contriv'd a plea&s;ant Scheme, to make the mo&s;t of his
Ingenuity. He compos'd a Copy of Ver&s;es; and, in&s;tead of <HI>Writing</HI>
them, in the u&s;ual Manner, caus'd them to be <HI>Engrav'd</HI> on a Block of
<HI>Marble,</HI> that was large enough for a <HI>Tomb|&s;tone!</HI>&mdash;He
loaded a Cart with his Compli|ment, and went to wait on the Ba&s;ha with it;
who, having Notice of his intended Pre&s;ent, &s;ent out the Ma&s;ter of his
Buildings, to examine the Size, and Workman&s;hip, of the Stone, and pay for
it, according to its Value&mdash;The Poet went away very much &s;urpriz'd, and
di&s;&s;atisfy'd, and writ his Patron a Com|plaint, How contrary to His
<HI>Greatne&s;s</HI>'s Cu|&s;tom, His Officers had pre&s;um'd to Treat him: To
which the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> an&s;wer'd, gravely, That <HI>it aro&s;e, from a
Change, in His Manner;&mdash;For, whereas he had, formerly, reward|ed, by
WEIGHT, He &s;hou'd, hereafter, do it, by MEASURE.</HI></P>
<P>WE have <HI>&s;ome,</HI> among our Nobility, who are equally
Illu&s;trious for their <HI>Learning,</HI> and their <HI>Patronage</HI> of
Learning: But they are &s;o <HI>Poetically per&s;ecuted,</HI> by the Swarms of
Little <PB N="137" REF="138"> Creatures, who have no End, in Writing, but the
Profit they propo&s;e to draw from it, That they meet with daily Provocations
to repel the Avarice of Flattery, with a Spirit, and Sharpne&s;s, like the
<HI>Ba&s;ha's,</HI> above-men|tion'd: And, This, no Doubt, is one Rea&s;on for
the Neglect, which <HI>Works of Genius</HI> often meet with, when addre&s;s'd
to Men of Quality.</P>
<P>BUT, if Contempt is due to the <HI>Merce|nary,</HI> The
<HI>Mode&s;t</HI> de&s;erve Encouragement: And They, who are truly Generous,
&s;hou'd never wait, till Occa&s;ion offers it &s;elf; but &s;eek, and make,
the Opportunity. For, as the Sharpne&s;s of our <HI>Sight</HI> is be&s;t prov'd
by the <HI>Remotene&s;s,</HI> in which we di&s;tingui&s;h Ob|jects; &s;o our

<HI>Di&s;tance,</HI> and <HI>invite</HI> it, to aproach us.</P>
<P>I AM always pleas'd with the Pro&s;pect of Any Work, from which
the <HI>Publick</HI> may promi&s;e It &s;elf, either Entertainment, or
In|&s;truction: And I hope, The Gentleman, who has &s;ent me the following

<P>MY Devotion, I am afraid, is not &s;o <HI>Pure,</HI> and
<HI>Simple,</HI> as it ought to be. There is a <HI>Nicene&s;s,</HI> in my
Ta&s;te of other People's Behaviour, at Church, which ill agrees with the Duty,
which I my &s;elf am there, for the Di&s;charge of.</P>
<P>I di&s;covered this Defect of <HI>Grace</HI> in the Con&s;titution
of my Zeal, by a kind of Re|probate <HI>Contempt,</HI> which I found my &s;elf
affected by, la&s;t <HI>Sunday,</HI> again&s;t that plain, and humble,
Aukwardne&s;s, with which the mangled <HI>P&s;alms</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> were
vociferated, by the Congregation.&mdash;A Gentleman, of my Acquaintance,
unluckily whi&s;pered me, (in the mid&s;t of what they call their
<HI>Singing</HI>) That he knew a <HI>Dutch</HI> Painter, who had drawn the
livelie&s;t <HI>Grote&s;que</HI> Piece, in <HI>Europe,</HI> by an Idea, that he
brought out of Church <PB N="143" REF="144"> with him, from a Gallery of
<HI>Country P&s;alms-Singers.</HI></P>
<P>MY Eyes, and Ears, took his Hint; and I &s;hall never forget the

Hanging Heads, Oblique Chins, Stretch'd Mouths, and Di&s;torted
Mu&s;cles!&mdash;The <HI>Voi|ces</HI> too were as provokingly di&s;&s;onant, as
the <HI>Looks</HI> were ludicrou&s;ly penitential!&mdash;In&s;tead of finding

<HI>a&s;hamed,</HI> at the pre&s;umptuous Licen&s;e, with which the
Coar&s;e&s;t, and mo&s;t unskilful <HI>Roar|ers</HI> took upon 'em to <HI>bear
Part,</HI> in Mu&s;ick, Sacred to the Prai&s;es of the ALMIGHTY.</P>
<P>THIS brought to my Reflection, with how much Rea&s;on, as well as
Reverence, The <HI>Choirs</HI> of our <HI>Cathedral</HI> Churches pre&s;erve
the Dignity of their Religious Harmony, by <HI>ex|cluding the Unskill'd</HI>;

Perfection.</P>
<P>BUT, It is not only the Manner in which <HI>P&s;alms</HI> are
commonly &s;ung, that I con&s;ider as an Indecency: The <HI>P&s;alms
Them&s;elves,</HI> as we have them in the old <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> Ver&s;ion,
are a Di&s;grace to our our Learning, Language, and our

<P>I DECLAR'D, in a late Paper, that my Speculations &s;hou'd
&s;ometimes, extend to <HI>Politicks.</HI> This Day's Entertainment &s;hall be
an Introduction, to that Purpo&s;e; which I &s;hall, occa&s;ionally, pur&s;ue,
with the open Spirit of a PLAIN DEALER: a&s;&s;erting, and making free with All
the <HI>Liberty</HI> I was <HI>born to:</HI>&mdash;A Liberty, which does not
alone in|title us to a Property in our <HI>E&s;tates,</HI> but in our
<HI>Thoughts</HI> al&s;o. It is the great Charecte|ri&s;tick of every Free-born
<HI>Briton,</HI> That <HI>He may &s;peak, as He thinks, and think, as He
plea&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE, like the Provinces of the declin|ing Empire of <HI>Old
Rome,</HI> we are fretting, and di&s;turbing our&s;elves, (under the Notion of
<HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Principle)</HI> to &s;upport the factious Avarice of
a few a&s;piring Men, who find their Intere&s;t in our Divi&s;ions, the
<HI>GOTHS are at</HI> <PB N="150" REF="151"> <HI>our Gate</HI>; and we are
apprehen&s;ive of no <HI>out|ward</HI> Danger.&mdash;There &s;eems to be
ri&s;ing, near us, That NORTHERN LYON, which has, &s;o often, been prophe&s;ied
of: And I believe, in the Cour&s;e of my Papers, I &s;hall make it
&s;ufficiently vi&s;ible, that, if early Mea&s;ures are not taken, by Way of
<HI>Pre|vention,</HI> again&s;t the threaten'd Evil, the UNIVERSAL EMPIRE,
which <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively alarm'd
<HI>Europe</HI> with a fruitle&s;s Dread of, &s;eems, in Reality, to be coming
upon us, with all the Terrors of a <HI>Fifth General Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>IF it is &s;uppos'd, That &s;uch a Fear con|cerns <HI>Us,</HI>
le&s;s than <HI>other States,</HI> which may be thought to lie more expos'd, I
doubt we deceive Our-&s;elves, by a Vanity, common to all Nations, in
over-rating the <HI>Hazard</HI> of an Enemy, who &s;hou'd pre&s;ume to invade
us.&mdash;Our <HI>Ships,</HI> (powerful, and numerous, as they are) are more
formidable by the Re|putation of their Terror, than by the Danger of their
Oppo&s;ition. For, to expect that a <HI>Fleet</HI> will, at all Times, be able
to keep Danger at a Di&s;tance, were to give our <HI>Pro|tection</HI> to the
<HI>Winds</HI>&mdash;How many <HI>Caveats,</HI> again&s;t &s;o un&s;table a
Security, cannot our own Hi&s;tory furni&s;h us with?&mdash;Neither ought it to
be con&s;ider'd, as a Remote, or Chimerical, Pro&s;pect, <HI>That we may be
match'd in our Marine Preten&s;ions</HI>&mdash;We cannot po&s;|&s;ibly have
more Advantage, in the Fame, and Practice, of Dominion at Sea, again&s;t 
<PB N="151" REF="152"> any of our Cotemporary States, than the
<HI>Carthaginians</HI> had again&s;t the <HI>Romans:</HI> And the Succe&s;s
which crown'd the Indu&s;try, and unconquerable Spirit, of the&s;e La&s;t, in
De|fiance of <HI>all</HI> Ob&s;tacles, as well of <HI>Nature,</HI> as of
<HI>Art,</HI> is a Le&s;&s;on, which may may teach our State&s;men, That there
is infinite Diffe|rence, between Things <HI>difficult,</HI> and Things
<HI>impo&s;&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P>NOT to in&s;i&s;t on, the memorable Sur|prize, with which
<HI>France,</HI> in a few Years Application, convinc'd us, with how little
Rea&s;on we had indulg'd a Notion, <HI>That there were natural
Impo&s;&s;ibilities to prevent that Great Nation from becoming Powerful, at
Sea;</HI> All which were found mere Shadows, when the Genius of her Mini&s;ters
turn'd their Thoughts on attempting it!&mdash;The prodi|gious, and
enterprizing, Spirit of the pre&s;ent <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> has,
at once, e&s;tabli&s;h'd, in the <HI>Baltick,</HI> a Third <HI>Maritime</HI>
Power, Supe|riour to Both its old Ones: And, now, while I am Writing, has a
Fleet of Sixty <HI>Ships of the Line,</HI> be&s;ides
<HI>Frigates</HI>;&mdash;and <HI>Gallies</HI> without Number.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>natural</HI> Advantages, whether for <HI>building,
equipping,</HI> or <HI>maintaining</HI> a Navy, this Prince has the Start of
us, beyond all Compari&s;on.&mdash;And &s;ince, when his Ships are as
<HI>Many,</HI> and as <HI>Strong,</HI> as ours, (which judging by what has been
done already, they may be, in Three or Four Years) our whole Pretence to
Superiority mu&s;t be plac'd in our <PB N="152" REF="153"> <HI>Skill,</HI> and
<HI>Experience,</HI> in Sea-Fights, how dangerous wou'd the Con&s;equence be
found, &s;hou'd he hit upon &s;ome New Method of <HI>improving his Ve&s;&s;els,
in their Strength, De|fen&s;ive, or Offen&s;ive?</HI> Many High, and Ardu|ous
Attempts toward which, have bu&s;ied, &s;ome Years pa&s;t, the unre&s;ting

<P>WITHIN the Memory of Numbers, yet living, the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> were con&s;ider'd, as a People, &s;o far from
<HI>Dangerous,</HI> that they were even <HI>Contemptible:</HI> And the
precipitate Ad|vance of their Reputation in Arms, and Po|licy, is a Proof, that
no Vanity is more weak|ly founded, and unju&s;t, than the Common Practice of
all Nations, to e&s;teem <HI>Them&s;elves</HI> more <HI>Valiant</HI> than their
<HI>Neighbours.</HI>&mdash;Man|kind is every where the <HI>&s;ame,</HI> by
Nature, till a <HI>Difference</HI> is produc'd, by Cu&s;tom.&mdash;What Nation
<HI>braver,</HI> than the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> un|der <HI>Cyrus?</HI> Yet, what
Nation <HI>ba&s;er,</HI> when they oppos'd the Arms of
<HI>Alexander?</HI>&mdash;What People, under Heaven, have more in|rich'd the
Hi&s;tories of former Ages, than the Ance&s;tors of tho&s;e degenerate
<HI>Greeks,</HI> who are, now, the Di&s;grace of <HI>Chri&s;tendom? Con|tented
Slaves,</HI> under a Tyranny, a thou&s;and Times more in&s;upportable than the
wor&s;t of Tho&s;e, in &s;corn of which their ancient Ora|tors have fill'd the
World with Noi&s;y Decla|mations, in the boa&s;ted Cau&s;e of <HI>Liberty!

clearer Superiority over their Enemies, than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Armies,
which our <HI>Fir&s;t Edward,</HI> led to War again&s;t the <HI>Scots?</HI>
And, yet, what Truth more undeniable, than the &s;hame|ful <HI>Cowardice,</HI>
and downright <HI>Ba&s;ene&s;s,</HI> of the Sons of tho&s;e very
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> drawn out, again&s;t the Sons of the &s;ame <HI>Scots,</HI>

<P>COURAGE, when con&s;ider'd <HI>nationally,</HI> is not the Effect
of <HI>Nature,</HI> but of <HI>Di&s;cipline!</HI> Skill, and Practice, teaching
an Agility in the U&s;e of Arms, excite a Plea&s;ure in their Exerci&s;e: And,
abating, by Degrees, that Fear of Death, which is natural to all Men, convert
it into Hope of Victory; and a proud, and re&s;tle&s;s, Thir&s;t of
Glory.&mdash;<HI>Arms</HI> there|fore, and a dexterous Superiority in the U&s;e
of them, &s;hould be e&s;teemed the <HI>Sinews of War</HI>; and not MONEY, as
is, commonly, pretended.&mdash;An Army, capable of <HI>conque|ring,</HI> will
always find Means of <HI>&s;ub&s;i&s;ting:</HI> But <HI>Money,</HI> though it
<HI>&s;ub&s;i&s;ts</HI> an ill-di&s;cipli|ned Army, can never qualifie it for
<HI>conque|ring.</HI>&mdash;The Helple&s;s <HI>Indians,</HI> of
<HI>Mexico,</HI> were infinitely <HI>Richer,</HI> than their
Plunderers,&mdash;the <HI>Goths,</HI> when (from that very Coun|try, which the

them only, <HI>Iron</HI>; they knew, <HI>That</HI> would make them Ma&s;ters of
all the <HI>Gold,</HI> they &s;hould have Occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155">PRINCES, who&s;e Authority is ab&s;olute,
and uncontroll'd, by <HI>Privileges, Rights,</HI> or <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI>;
who&s;e Dominions are va&s;t, and po|pulous, and who&s;e Subjects are
laborious, hardy, and obedient; and acquainted with no <HI>Learning,</HI> but
what is &s;ufficient to aid their Indu&s;try, without inflaming their
Pride.&mdash;Such Princes, become <HI>dreadful,</HI> as &s;oon as they appear
<HI>ambitious,</HI> and exert them&s;elves in Pre|parations for
<HI>War.</HI>&mdash;But, when it happens, too, that a Prince, in &s;o tempting
a Situa|tion, has a Genius capable of <HI>Improving</HI> the Art-Military, It
is difficult to put <HI>Limits</HI> to the Con&s;equences, which may attend His
Fortune.</P>
<P>THO' the Study of the <HI>Art of War</HI> has been carried to a
great Perfection, yet there is Room enough left to give Scope to the Force of
Genius, this Way: And it would, perhaps, be found, upon Trial, That the
<HI>Modern Sy&s;tem,</HI> (notwith&s;tanding the U&s;e of <HI>Gunpowder,</HI>
which was unknown to the An|cients) is as &s;ubject as the <HI>old</HI> was, to

<HI>Di&s;coveries,</HI> on tho&s;e Sides, mo&s;t e&s;pecially, where we believe
our&s;elves &s;ecure&s;t.</P>
<P>THE <HI>mea&s;ur'd Lines</HI> of Humane Fore&s;ight, which are,
&s;o proudly di&s;tingui&s;hed, by the Name of <HI>Policy,</HI> are vain
Amu&s;ements, and mere <HI>Cobweb Subtleties.</HI>&mdash;Their narrow, bu&s;y,
Schemes, of <HI>balancing</HI> the Power, and Inte|re&s;ts of Nations, are
often in&s;ufficient for the <PB N="155" REF="156"> Purpo&s;es of their
De&s;igners, becau&s;e the&s;e High-way State&s;men <HI>found</HI> their Maxims
upon <HI>Error, in the fir&s;t Concoction.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Force</HI> of a
Prince is, by their Rule, to be calculated, from his <HI>Revenue,</HI> and his
<HI>Revenue,</HI> from the Wealth of his Subjects: But This Argument depends
intirely on the general, <HI>mi&s;taken,</HI> Notion, <HI>That All Equal
Numbers, will be of Equal Weight, in War</HI>; which is &s;o far from being
<HI>true,</HI> That, &s;hould the <HI>Poore&s;t</HI> Prince in <HI>Europe,</HI>
fall upon the <HI>Riche&s;t,</HI> with a Skill in Arms, as much Superiour, as
He is <HI>Infe|riour</HI> in his Numbers, the Di&s;parity would be
<HI>revers'd,</HI> immediately.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Romans,</HI> who never <HI>conquer'd, in order to prolong
a War,</HI> but to make it bear its own Expences; and encrea&s;e, as well their
<HI>Trea&s;ury,</HI> as their <HI>Reputation,</HI> were &s;o far from this new
Way, of computing an Ene|my's <HI>Strength,</HI> by his <HI>Riches,</HI> that
Their Judgment was directly contrary. And this Opinion of Ancient Times appears
&s;trongly in that magnanimous An&s;wer, which was given by a <HI>Gaul,</HI> to
a King of <HI>Macedon,</HI> who &s;hew'd him his Heaps of <HI>Gold,</HI> in
order to excite Terror; and, then, ask'd him, <HI>What He thought of His
Condition?</HI> The rugged Soldier reply'd, &s;harply, <HI>That as to what
con|cern'd His Condition, a Stranger could be no Judge: But His</HI> BOUNTY,
<HI>He could perceive, Extraordinary,&mdash;&s;ince he had taken &s;uch

worth their Conquering.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="157">WHERE a Prince is really

<SALUTE>Mr. PLAIN DEALER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I HAVE been One of your <HI>Female</HI> Rea|ders, ever &s;ince

<HI>Elephant,</HI> from <HI>Guinea,</HI> that cou'd dance, <HI>Moll Peatly,
Overturn Apple Baskets,</HI> and play a cleverer Circle of of Tricks than a

<P>I SHALL not confine my &s;elf to any &s;ingle Part of

&s;o <HI>Merito|rious.</HI>&mdash;It is the &s;ame Thing to me, whe|ther the

<HI>Popo,</HI> or of <HI>Ekke Tokki</HI>; Provided only, That the

<HI>Laudable Cu&s;toms</HI> at, from the One's having been the Prerogative of a

Word, <HI>ROMP</HI>: A private Remark, by the bye, for the particular U&s;e and
In&s;truction of the Lively <HI>Mrs. Laetitia Gambol!</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Sable <HI>Toa&s;ts</HI> of tho&s;e Sunny Climates have &s;uch
<HI>Choice</HI> of Tempting Privileges, that I &s;hall have Room, in this
Paper, to recommend but a very few of them: I will, therefore, &s;elect the
Be&s;t; and begin with this ARCH-CLAIM of <HI>Virginity, within the
Tropicks,</HI> that Girls, at Nine Years old, commence <HI>Women!</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Young Ladies,</HI> too, in mo&s;t Places, are at Liberty
to di&s;po&s;e, freely, of what|ever may be call'd <HI>Their own:</HI> And,
when, afterwards, they think of <HI>Marrying, their</HI> <PB N="161" REF="162">
<HI>Credit,</HI> like that of other Traders, is rated the <HI>higher,</HI> by
how much <HI>wider,</HI> and more <HI>publickly,</HI> They have carried on
their <HI>Dealing.</HI></P>
<P>I THINK, no Doubt can ari&s;e, concerning the Welcome with which
<HI>The&s;e Two valuable RIGHTS</HI> will be receiv'd: But, not be|ing
<HI>altogether &s;o clear,</HI> in my Opinion, con|cerning the
<HI>following,</HI> I &s;hall leave it to be weigh'd, maturely, How, far it may
be <HI>of U&s;e AMONG US,</HI> it is a <HI>Privilege to retire, from the
Fatigue of Man's Society, after having been Mothers of Ten Children.</HI></P>
<P>THE Antient <HI>Tryal, by bitter Waters,</HI> has been more
generally heard of, than ap|prov'd, among our <HI>Women</HI> here at home, who,
if not, perhaps, the <HI>Deepe&s;t,</HI> are, un|que&s;tionably, the
<HI>prettie&s;t Ca&s;ui&s;ts,</HI> in the Univer&s;e. But the Duskier Beauties,
of <HI>Negroland,</HI> when under Accu&s;ations of <HI>too much good
Nature,</HI> have an Appeal, to <HI>&s;weeter Waters,</HI> in Ju&s;tification
of their Innocence: For, in order to di&s;cover, to a jealous Hus|band, whether
the Wife has been guilty, or not, &s;he is thrown, headlong, into a River: And
if &s;he <HI>drowns,</HI> &s;he was a <HI>Sinner.</HI> But, it is a Remark, of
great Con&s;olation, That there never was found a <HI>Woman,</HI> who had not
<HI>Lightne&s;s enough to Swim</HI>; and e&s;cape the Malice of her
Accu&s;ers.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;omething, too, in their agree|able Manner of
<HI>Mourning, for the Death of a Husband,</HI> which de&s;erves to be offer'd
to the Con&s;ideration of the SEX, in the&s;e more <PB N="162" REF="163">
<HI>Phlegmatick, Northern,</HI> Regions: And one wou'd wonder, indeed, how any
thing, <HI>&s;o extravagantly Polite,</HI> &s;hou'd have got Footing, among
People, who never Sub&s;crib'd, to an <HI>Opera.</HI>&mdash;The whole Term of
&s;uch <HI>Mourn|ing</HI> is included within <HI>Fourteen Days:</HI> And the
Ceremony con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>Cries,</HI> which are modulated by the Tunes of
Mu&s;ical In&s;tru|ments; and accommodated (with a certain Equitable Dexterity)
to the Ea&s;e of the <HI>Performer,</HI> and more lively Entertainment of the
<HI>Audience</HI>; by large, intermediate, <HI>Pau&s;es,</HI> during which they
drink Brandy, and &s;moke Tobacco, 'till their <HI>Spirits</HI> are duly
rais'd, to expect when the Mu&s;ick be|gins again, for <HI>another Act,</HI> of
the <HI>Ob|&s;equies.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, above all their agreeable Cu&s;toms, I contemplate, with
mo&s;t Reverence, the va&s;t Extent of their <HI>Charity!</HI> There is, in it,
an uncommon Profoundne&s;s; and a Tenderne&s;s of Heart, beyond
Example!&mdash;It is a Practice, among the <HI>Rich Negro Ladies,</HI> on the
<HI>Gold Coa&s;t,</HI> to give Orders, on their Death Beds, for buying up a
Number of Female-Slaves, to be&s;tow on the <HI>Publick,</HI> as <HI>Living
Legacies,</HI> who&s;e whole Bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to be at Every Body's
Ser|vice, <HI>in One &s;ole Employment,</HI> (which they are, All, equally,
capable of) for the Price of <HI>Three Periwincle-Shells.</HI>&mdash;They
con&s;ider This, as a Work, of great Mercy, and Compa&s;&s;ion; and,
con&s;cious of their <PB N="163" REF="164"> pious Purpo&s;e, clo&s;e their
Eyes, and die, &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>I COU'D add an infinite Variety of &s;uch uncommon Commodities as
The&s;e: But the Foregoing will &s;erve, as <HI>Samples,</HI> of what <HI>Rich
Goods</HI> may be imported, for the U&s;es, which my Corre&s;pondent hints at,
if, in Right of her &s;elf, and the <HI>Ladies</HI> &s;he acts for, &s;he cou'd
propo&s;e any <HI>Scheme</HI> of <HI>Engraftment,</HI> by vertue whereof, the
<HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tants</HI> of the <HI>Royal Company</HI> might co|operate with
the <HI>Si&s;terhood.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not to be que&s;tion'd, but, when &s;uch a Scheme comes to
be &s;een, the Di|rectors of &s;ome other, of our more thriv|ing
<HI>Societies</HI> will <HI>&s;tir</HI> again&s;t it, out of Envy, and
propo&s;e their <HI>own</HI> re&s;pective <HI>Bodies,</HI> as mo&s;t Capable
of, or more adap|ted to, the mention'd <HI>Incorporation.</HI> But the Ladies
will, I hope, have Honour enough to <HI>keep clo&s;e</HI> to their fir&s;t
Engraf|ters: And, lea&s;t their natural Di&s;po&s;ition <HI>to think too meanly
of Them&s;elves, and their own Rea&s;onings,</HI> &s;hould expo&s;e them,
with|out Defence, to the Force of Arguments, they cannot An&s;wer, I will
conclude this E&s;&s;ay for their Service with the Example of a ROYAL AFRICAN;
<HI>His Maje&s;ty, the King of</HI> Boffoe; who, when his <HI>Con&s;cience</HI>
was a little puzzled, brought him&s;elf off, by his <HI>Re&s;olution.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="164" REF="165">KING <HI>Yagou,</HI> the abovemeant, was a

<P>I REMEMBER a Pa&s;&s;age, in &s;ome <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Writer,
which carries a &s;harp, and in&s;tru|ctive, Moral. An <HI>Emir,</HI> of great
Sanctity, had a Cu&s;tom, every Night, to call his Fa|mily together, that they
might &s;it round him, with due Gravity, to hear his Son read &s;ome Chapter of
the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which the Fa|ther would take Plea&s;ure in opening, and
en|larging on, to his Dome&s;tick Congregation. It happened, one Night, that,
in the mid&s;t of the Sermon, the whole Audience <HI>fell a&s;leep</HI>; except
the Preacher, and his Son: Which la&s;t, a&s;&s;oon as he ob&s;erv'd it,
inter|rupted his Father, with this Remark.&mdash;<HI>See, Sir, the Fruits of
your Good Purpo&s;e! There is not one, of them All, but &s;leeps, as &s;oundly,
as if God's Word de&s;erv'd no Reverence!</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Emir</HI> look'd
round the Company, and &s;hutting up his <HI>Spectacles,</HI> in the Book,
again&s;t a fitter Opportunity, drew his Di&s;cour&s;e to a 
<PB N="166" REF="167"> Conclu&s;ion, with this Reply, to his Son's
In|telligence&mdash;<HI>You had, your &s;elf, been better employ'd, in adding
One to the Number of Sleep|ers, than in waking, not &s;o much to correct your
own Faults, as to ob&s;erve the Faults of Others.</HI></P>
<P>I receiv'd a Letter, the other Day, which brought this Story to my
Remembrance, and is one Proof, among many, how difficult a Province he
undertakes, who a&s;&s;umes the Office of a PLAIN DEALER, at a Time, when
People are &s;o <HI>vigorous,</HI> in the Cen&s;ures, which they make
<HI>Them&s;elves</HI>; and &s;o <HI>languid,</HI> in their Approbation of
Tho&s;e, which others make, with the &s;ame Liberty!</P>
<P>The Author of this Letter is, &s;o kind, as to let me know, 
<Q REND="inline">"He is one of my <HI>Be&s;t Friends</HI>; he will
not therefore in&s;i&s;t on my Di&s;ingenuity, to <HI>fall foul of</HI>&mdash;a
&s;ingle Sen|tence,&mdash;in one of my late Papers; and, <HI>dwell on one
Error,</HI> in a voluminous Au|thor: But he is &s;o good as to be in Pain for
my <HI>Veracity</HI>; having carefully (he &s;ays) examin'd every &s;ingle
Paragraph of <HI>Mr.</HI> Trapp's <HI>Preface to his Tran&s;lation of</HI>
Vir|gil, and not being able to di&s;cover, what I charge him with.&mdash;He
clo&s;es all, with a Hint, that he writes, in Vindication of that worthy and
Reverend, Author; and would not have Offence taken <HI>at every
Trifle.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>THE VERACITY of the PLAIN DEALER being the Side he will be &s;ure 
<PB N="167" REF="168"> to be mo&s;t defen&s;ible on, it was unskilfully done,
for a <HI>Lover of the Mu&s;es,</HI> as my Cor|re&s;pondent &s;ub&s;cribes
him&s;elf, to bring on his Attack, &s;o ra&s;hly, on that Quarter.&mdash;He
ought, fir&s;t, to have been very careful, and confirm'd, in his
<HI>Di&s;coveries.</HI>&mdash;But, to re|move the <HI>Cloud</HI> from his
Sight, if he plea&s;es to turn to <HI>Page</HI> 382, of the fir&s;t Volume of
the mention'd Tran&s;lation; in an <HI>E&s;&s;ay, on moving the
Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> previous to the Remarks on the 4th Book, he will find a
Paragraph ended thus,&mdash;<HI>We have
not&mdash;as&mdash;yet&mdash;in|deed&mdash;completed the Explication,
propos'd:&mdash;For
&s;omething&mdash;more&mdash;&s;till&mdash;remains&mdash;be|hind.</HI>&mdash;If
this differs from what it appear'd in my Paper, it is only by being a little
<HI>wor&s;e</HI> than I made it.</P>
<P>THUS much, to the <HI>Charge,</HI> in that only Part, which
carried any <HI>Appearance</HI> of Rea|&s;on with it.&mdash;The other Articles
have no Weight, at all, but from the Regard that is due to a <HI>mi&s;taken
Good-Nature;</HI> which has mi&s;led the Gentleman, whoever he was, to
apprehend, as a <HI>Trifle,</HI> an Error of the fir&s;t Magnitude, in
Writing.&mdash;It is certainly the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the <HI>Aim,</HI> of every
Author, to <HI>explain,</HI> and <HI>illu&s;trate,</HI> his Argument: But this
tedious Redundance ob&s;cures, and perplexes it.&mdash;Where a Man &s;hould
<HI>imprint</HI> Idea's, he di&s;tracts and <HI>erazes</HI> them: And,
in&s;tead of awakening the Pa&s;&s;ions, affects the Spirits with
Drow&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;Such a <HI>TRIFLE</HI> is this Fault, which my
Corre&s;pondent is for <PB N="168" REF="169"> pa&s;&s;ing over, with &s;o
tender-hearted a Blind|ne&s;s!</P>
<P>THE cen&s;ur'd Pa&s;&s;age, then, is no Error, of &s;uch
<HI>&s;mall Importance,</HI> as the Animadver|tor had thought fit to imagine;
but he falls, next, into another Mi&s;take, of con&s;idering it, as a Place,
pick'd out by the Inqui&s;ition of a malicious Eye: Whereas (if he had been as
attentive to the <HI>Argument,</HI> of the Paper, where he found that
Cen&s;ure, as he was to the <HI>Cen&s;ure It&s;elf</HI>) nothing would have
been more ea&s;y, than to have ob&s;erv'd <HI>Numbers, of the &s;ame Kind</HI>
of <HI>Amplifications,</HI> which might, with equal Effect, have been borrow'd
from that work: And, thence, he mu&s;t have drawn this natural and obvious
Conclu&s;ion.&mdash;That <HI>one Error, only, was dwelt on,</HI> not be|cau&s;e
it was all that could be found, but be|cau&s;e it was all, that could be
admitted in that Paper.</P>
<P>AS to the <HI>Worthine&s;s,</HI> or <HI>Reverence,</HI> of the
Author, the Letter-Writer him&s;elf can wi&s;h no le&s;s Ill to him, than the
PLAIN DEALER does. But this is a Matter en|tirely out of the Que&s;tion. The
<HI>Per&s;on</HI> has no|thing to do, where what he has <HI>written,</HI> and
<HI>publi&s;hed,</HI> is the Ground of the Argument.&mdash;For a
<HI>Friend,</HI> Partiality is <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI>: And, again&s;t an
<HI>Enemy,</HI> it is <HI>Ba&s;ene&s;s.</HI> The Merit of a Cau&s;e lies above
the Level of &s;uch low Motives; and they, who would reach it, as they ought,
mu&s;t be li&s;ted in their Attempt, between <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and
<HI>Re&s;olution.</HI>&mdash;There is <PB N="169" REF="170"> nothing, which the
PLAIN DEALER has a &s;incerer Dete&s;tation of, than Per&s;onal Re|proach or
Defamation: But then, on the other &s;ide, he who dares not &s;peak out openly,
whenever Occa&s;ion offers it &s;elf, concerning the Mi&s;carriages of the
Greate&s;t Men, or the Vertues of the mo&s;t Unpro&s;perous, has a Soul, below

<P>BUT, to make a Tran&s;ition to a Subject, which I have, for &s;ome
Time (in vain) been expecting an Opportunity to <HI>re&s;ume,</HI> with a

po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of&mdash;Let me give them, through your Means, the following
<HI>true</HI> Relation.</P>
<P> <HI>Olivia</HI> is a Lady, of genteel, and fa&s;hio|nable
Education; for her Mother took early Care to <HI>&s;hew her the World,</HI> as
they call it: That is, To teach her, through the mo&s;t contrary
<HI>Appearances,</HI> to intend No|thing, but her <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> and
<HI>Intere&s;t.&mdash;Pamphilio</HI> is a Gentleman, of good E&s;tate, in the
Neighbourhood.&mdash;The Lady's Re|putation was un&s;ullied, He &s;aw her
often; and, every Time he &s;aw her, &s;aw new Marks of her Wit, and Good
Humour; her Freedom and Sincerity; 'till from <HI>ad|miring,</HI> he fell to
<HI>adoring</HI> her.</P>
<P> HIS Love was inflam'd, by the little, innocent, Encouragements,
which <HI>Olivia</HI> knew how to give, without incurring the Imputation of
<HI>Forwardne&s;s:</HI> and which <HI>Pamphilio</HI> regarded, as &s;o many
mode&s;t Overtures, to the Advantage of his Pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;His Vi&s;its
were more frequent, and more open. He could, no longer, conceal his Love; he
declar'd it, at once, to, both, <PB N="178" REF="179"> <HI>Olivia,</HI> and her
Mother&mdash;for her <HI>Father</HI> was dead: And they, Both, gave him Hope,
of &s;ucceeding, in his Wi&s;hes.</P>
<P> <HI>Pamphilio</HI>'s Affection growing &s;tronger and
&s;tronger; he became impatient for their Marriage; in the near Pro&s;pect of
which, all the Neighbourhood rejoyc'd, and did their Utmo&s;t to advance it.
For they ob&s;erv'd, how his Soul <HI>doated</HI> on her; and darted it|&s;elf
into his <HI>Eyes,</HI> whenever &s;he approach'd him.&mdash;<HI>Olivia</HI>
declin'd marrying.&mdash;She was too young, &s;he &s;aid, to be Mi&s;tre&s;s of
a Family; and in&s;i&s;ted on a <HI>Year more,</HI> in which &s;he might fix
her Re&s;olution.&mdash;Tho' this <HI>Year,</HI> to <HI>Pamphilio,</HI> was a
<HI>Lover's Eternity,</HI> he was to &s;ubmit, on any Terms; and the Time,
requir'd by <HI>Olivia,</HI> at la&s;t, drew near its Conclu&s;ion.&mdash;The
Lady, then, grew <HI>cooler,</HI> and the Lover <HI>more
tran&s;ported.</HI>&mdash;She declar'd to him, very frankly, That <HI>It was
impo&s;&s;ible for her to love him.</HI>&mdash;Neither <HI>Love,</HI> &s;he
&s;aid, nor <HI>Hatred, were Things in our own Power: And he ought not to take
it ill, that &s;he cou'd no longer deceive him.</HI></P>
<P> POOR <HI>Pamphilio</HI> had no Voice to <HI>reply.</HI> But a
&s;udden <HI>Tear,</HI> or two, <HI>&s;poke for him!</HI>&mdash;He trembled,
grew pale, and gaz'd on her&mdash;and &s;igh'd, at length this faint
Hope&mdash;<HI>That &s;he cou'd not, &s;ure, be in Ear|ne&s;t.</HI>&mdash;She
an&s;wered, <HI>He had no Rea&s;on to give him&s;elf the Air of &s;o much
Surprize.&mdash;She had never promis'd him Marriage,&mdash;</HI> 
<PB N="179" REF="180"> <HI>and was, yet, at her own
Di&s;po&s;al.&mdash;Pam|philio,</HI> bow'd, and left her; and has, al&s;o, left
<HI>Society.</HI> He &s;huns all his former Companions: And is &s;unk, in the
deepe&s;t Melancholy! His Affairs are neglected, his Health is de&s;troy'd; and
his Friends are enrag'd and a&s;toni&s;h'd!</P>
<P> ABOUT a Quarter of a Year ago, <HI>Olivia</HI> was
<HI>married:</HI> and with &s;o extraordinary a Succe&s;s, that her Relations
are already upon &s;uing out a <HI>Divorce.</HI>&mdash;What ought to ren|der
the Condition of this Lady <HI>Incon&s;olable,</HI> if &s;he has either
Genero&s;ity, or Reflection, is,&mdash;That <HI>Her</HI> hard Fortune afflicts
<HI>Pam|philio,</HI> to a &s;harper Degree than <HI>His own</HI> did!</P>
<P> SUCH a <HI>Jilting</HI> Temper, may, perhaps, be con&s;i&s;tent
with <HI>Cha&s;tity,</HI> but it can have neither <HI>Honour,</HI> nor
<HI>Tenderne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;She was form'd to in&s;pire Love, and very capable
of it, by <HI>Nature:</HI> But &s;he was harden'd, by <HI>Education,</HI> to
become <HI>un&s;u&s;ceptible</HI> of it.&mdash;She expos'd Charms to Sale,
which &s;he intended not to part with: And, then, like a covetous Trade&s;man,
who has lo&s;t his be&s;t Market, &s;he re&s;olv'd, as a pretty Revenge, <HI>to

<P>I NEVER met with any Accident, which more touchingly &s;urpriz'd
me, than the Death of my Friend, Sir <HI>Portly Rufus,</HI> under
Circum&s;tances, with Regard to his Fortune, much inferior to the Figure, he
had maintain'd in the World; and which made &s;uch Impre&s;|&s;ions on his
departing Soul, as &s;erv'd, at once, to excite my Pity, and inflame my
Admiration.</P>
<P>I VISITED him, during his Sickne&s;s, and found his Family in
great Di&s;order: The chearful Faces, which were formerly worn, by his
Servants, as the lively Signals of his Ho&s;pitality, were quench'd, and
&s;adden'd by a Sorrow, that prov'd its <HI>Deepne&s;s,</HI> by its
<HI>Silence.</HI>&mdash;He was fallen into a forc'd Sleep, 
<PB N="181" REF="182"> when I came down to his Hou&s;e in the Coun|try; and it
being late in the Evening, I went to Bed, with a Re&s;olution not to di&s;turb
him, 'till the Morning.&mdash;I lay awake, and heard the Clock &s;trike
<HI>One,</HI> indulging my Thoughts, under the Solemnity of the Midnight
Dark|ne&s;s, with a Thou&s;and bu&s;y Reflections, on the In&s;tability of our
Health and Plea&s;ures; when, from an Old Tower of the Pari&s;h-Church, which
was almo&s;t contiguous to my Chamber-Window, I heard the <HI>Toll,</HI> of a
Great Bell, &s;ound out, many Times, di&s;tinct|ly, with a deep, and mournful
Fullne&s;s, which left an unu&s;ual Vibration in the Air; and had &s;carce
ceas'd, when I found the whole Family alarm'd; and the Hou&s;e fill'd with
<HI>Shriekings,</HI> and the mo&s;t di&s;tracted Cries of Sorrow.</P>
<P>I ROSE, and dre&s;s'd my &s;elf, in much Amazement; and, following
the Clamour, found it, collected in the Sick Man's Cham|ber:&mdash;I was
a&s;&s;ur'd, at the crowded En|trance, That <HI>Sir Portly was a Dying
Man.</HI>&mdash;That <HI>the Bell, which had toll'd out, at Mid|night, always
did &s;o, of it's &s;elf, before every Death, that was to happen, in the
Family:</HI>&mdash;That <HI>it was a Warning, which had never
fail'd:</HI>&mdash;And, That <HI>Sir Portly, who had been wak'd, by the Sound
of it, was, him&s;elf, of the Opini|on, That he could live but a few
Hours.</HI></P>
<P>I FOUND my Friend, &s;itting up, in his Bed, very faint, and
&s;carce able to &s;peak; and looking round him, with a Mixture of Wildne&s;s,
and of Sorrow, on the Di&s;traction <PB N="182" REF="183"> of his A&s;&s;embled
Family.&mdash;As &s;oon as he &s;aw me near him, He gave me his Hand, with a
Glimp&s;e of Chearfulne&s;s, which &s;eem'd to brighten, through his Angui&s;h:
And, in|&s;i&s;ting, with much Earne&s;tne&s;s, That I &s;hould be left, for
&s;ome Time, alone, with him, the re&s;t withdrew, and I &s;at near him, on the
Bed-&s;ide.&mdash;He continued &s;ilent, for &s;everal Minutes, fixing his Eyes
on me, very &s;ted|fa&s;tly, and with much inward Commotion; till at la&s;t he
&s;poke to me, as follows.</P>
<Q>YOU have tim'd this Vi&s;it, kindly; for it is the La&s;t, you
will ever make me: It is a &s;en&s;ible Comfort, that I have this Op|portunity
to communicate my dying Senti|ments, to a Friend, who will be capable of doing
me Ju&s;tice, where the World may &s;peak of me with a mi&s;taking
Liberty&mdash;</Q>
<P>HERE he put a Key into my Hand, and di|rected me to find a Paper,
which I have now in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and from the Subject of which, I
&s;hall take Occa&s;ion, &s;ome Time hereafter, to draw more Ob&s;ervations
than One, for the U&s;e of Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, who may receive Entertainment,
and Advantage, from it.&mdash;He &s;aid &s;omething, concerning his Private
Affairs, in which my Advice he be|liev'd, might be of Service to his Family:
And, then a&s;&s;um'd a Di&s;cour&s;e, on the <HI>Toll|ing of the Pari&s;h
Bell,</HI> and proceeded in it with much Compo&s;ure.</P>
<Q><PB N="183" REF="184"> 
<P> I HAVE neither Learning, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> nor Lei&s;ure, to

<HI>Praeter-Na|tural Notices.</HI> It is enough for me, that <HI>It is
thus:</HI> And you will &s;oon be convinc'd of the Con&s;equence, with Regard
to my ap|proaching End.&mdash;But, Let not any Thing, &s;o common as
<HI>Death,</HI> be an Affliction, or Surprize to you. I have enjoy'd my Bed of
<HI>Sickne&s;s,</HI> like a <HI>Study.</HI> It has given me an Opportunity of
retiring into my &s;elf, without Partiality or Interruption!&mdash;The Danger
of my Condition drew a Curtain betwixt the World and me, and contra|cted all my
Bu&s;ine&s;s into the Compa&s;s of this &s;ilent Chamber. Here I have &s;een
Things, <HI>as they are,</HI> and learnt to judge of them, without
Prejudice.</P> 
<P> TO <HI>for&s;ake the World,</HI> gives me no Pain, from any
Attachment to its Plea&s;ures. It can tempt me with Nothing <HI>New</HI>; for I
have, already, &s;een it all.&mdash;Though I die (as I &s;hall) to Night,
<HI>To-morrow</HI> will be like to <HI>To-day</HI>: The &s;ame <HI>Sun</HI>
will ri&s;e up|on it; and leave it, in the &s;ame Darkne&s;s.&mdash;The
Sea&s;ons will come round again, and be <HI>call'd New</HI>; but they will be
no other than the Repetition of what I have, &s;o often beheld
already.&mdash;Why &s;hould it &s;tartle me, to be call'd back to the Place,
from which I came hither? I ro&s;e, from Uncertainty, into Life; and I am now
but returning, out of Life, into Uncertainty. Can any Thing 
<PB N="184" REF="185"> be more rea&s;onable, than that <HI>Others</HI> ha|ving
given Place to <HI>Me,</HI> I &s;hould give Place to others, in my
Turn?&mdash;Either I have not made the proper <HI>U&s;e</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI>
which I have enjoy'd &s;o long already, and therefore de|&s;erve to hold it no
longer: Or, having reap'd the Profit of Living, to what End &s;hould I wi&s;h
Life lengthen'd?</P> 
<P> I HAVE many Hopes, 'tis true, which, it grieves my Soul, to
leave imperfect: But, if I would live, 'till I am <HI>compleatly Happy,</HI> I
&s;eek what is never to be found. It were to act, like tho&s;e fooli&s;h
<HI>Indians,</HI> who run them&s;elves out of Breath, to <HI>catch the
Sun,</HI> when it &s;eems to <HI>&s;et, &s;o near them:</HI>&mdash;So might I

<P>IT has been ju&s;tly ob&s;erv'd, by our Wri|ters, in Defence of
the <HI>Stage,</HI> That <HI>It is a</HI> GLASS, <HI>in which we &s;ee, what
we, our|&s;elves, are, by the Image of our own Actions, repre&s;ented in the
Per&s;ons of Others.</HI>&mdash;Commend me then, to the Wit, or the Satire, of
one of our Theatres, where they have brought <HI>Newgate,</HI> into their
<HI>Mirrour,</HI> and taught our People of Quality, the elegant Art of
<HI>breaking Jayl,</HI> by Way of Diver&s;ion and Improvement.</P>
<P>TO Treat this Subject, if po&s;&s;ible, with &s;ome Appearance of
<HI>Gravity,</HI> either the Ta&s;te of our Audiences mu&s;t be depraved, to a
Degree of Horror; or the Judgment of our Ma&s;ter-Players corrupted, to a
Degree of Pity!&mdash;Too long, indeed, have the mo&s;t Succe&s;sful of our
Theatrical Entertainments been <HI>Low</HI> and <HI>Contemptible</HI>; but I
never ob|&s;erv'd, before, That they were <HI>Ungenerous,</HI> 
<PB N="190" REF="191"> and <HI>Inhumane!</HI>&mdash;What Idea will Po&s;terity
conceive of the Pre&s;ent Age, when they &s;hall read, among a thou&s;and
living Records, to our Infamy, That our Nobility, and Peo|ple, of the Fir&s;t
Figure, in Life, cou'd de|&s;cend to be Partakers in an In&s;ult offered to the
Memory, and Misfortune, of a poor Wretch, a <HI>Felon,</HI> who had, ju&s;t
before, been Executed, at <HI>Tyburn</HI>; by &s;itting, contented Spectators,
to ob&s;erve his Crimes, and his Mi&s;eries, acted over again, for their
Delight, and In&s;truction.</P>
<P>BUT, If (as <HI>Lucan</HI> &s;ays of <HI>Nero</HI>) the Gods cou'd
make Way for <HI>CAESAR,</HI> by no other Means than tho&s;e dreadful Things
which <HI>preceded</HI> him,&mdash;If <HI>Nothing le&s;s</HI> cou'd induce the
Town, to bear with the in&s;up|portable <HI>CAESAR in AEGYPT,</HI> than their
acting it immediately after SHEPHERD <HI>in</HI> NEWGATE, the Players have, at
lea&s;t, <HI>One</HI> Good Argument for permitting it:&mdash;They made Way too
for a <HI>Brother's Tragedy,</HI> who&s;e tender Heart might, have been broke,
if he had, <HI>twice, write di&s;mally,</HI> to no Pur|po&s;e.&mdash;<HI>King
JOHN,</HI> the Dramatick <HI>Abor|tive,</HI> of la&s;t Winter, was a
pu&s;illanimous Prince, and cou'd conde&s;cend to hear Rea|&s;ons, why it was
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubmit, for Fear of <HI>a forcible Depo&s;ing:</HI> But
<HI>CAESAR</HI> was a <HI>Hero,</HI> and too <HI>re&s;olv'd,</HI> to &s;hake at
<HI>Danger!</HI>&mdash;Tho' all the Serpents, of <HI>Africa,</HI> &s;hou'd have
<HI>hi&s;s'd in his Face,</HI> he would have regarded them, as little, 
<PB N="191" REF="192"> as he did, the <HI>Boxes,</HI> the <HI>Pit,</HI> and the
<HI>Gallery.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Tragedy is &s;o provoking, and co|pious a Field for Satire,
that it is with Diffi|culy, I re&s;train my Pen, from the &s;evere&s;t Licence
of ju&s;t <HI>Invectives.</HI> But I &s;often my Indignation, when I turn my
Eye, from the Play to the <HI>Author:</HI>&mdash;The Exemplary <HI>Candor,
Humanity, Politene&s;s, Affability,</HI> and <HI>Genero&s;ity,</HI> of that
Gentleman's indulgent Behaviour, with Regard to the Works and Intere&s;t of
other Writers! But, <HI>above all, his prodigious Mode&s;ty!</HI> The&s;e, his
extraordinary and well-known, Virtues, overbalance a thou&s;and Ab&s;urdities
in his Tragedy; and determine me to continue &s;ilent.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Theatre,</HI> to confe&s;s the Truth, is a Subject of too
much <HI>Con&s;equence,</HI> from its Effect on the Morals, and Behaviour of
the <HI>Publick,</HI> to leave it either decent, or rea&s;on|able, to omit
Defects in the Stage's Con&s;titu|tion, and de&s;cend to the Actor's particular
Failings.&mdash;But we have Per&s;ons on the Stage, who want not &s;ome
<HI>Graces,</HI> and Ge|nerous Qualities, as well of Body, as of Mind, which
might have <HI>adorn'd,</HI> even the Be&s;t of tho&s;e Characters, which they
are ac|cu&s;tom'd to repre&s;ent: And of The&s;e I &s;hall &s;peak
&s;eriou&s;ly, and with Plea&s;ure, on Occa|&s;ions which will offer
them&s;elves, when I come, in a little Time, to con&s;ider the <HI>Pre|&s;ent
State of our Stage,</HI> and what Ju&s;tice there may be, in tho&s;e Pretences
to its <HI>Im|provement,</HI> <PB N="192" REF="193"> which we have heard &s;o
very much of, under its Management, as it now &s;tands.</P>
<P>BUT, TO return to my fir&s;t Subject: There have not been wanting,
publick Marks of Di&s;approbation, as often as tho&s;e ill-cho|&s;en
Entertainments above-mentioned have been exhibited: Yet, they <HI>went on, with
an unmoveable Steadine&s;s of Re&s;olution,</HI> which, in a Cau&s;e, the
<HI>Rever&s;e</HI> of theirs, might de|&s;erve to be call'd a <HI>Virtue</HI>;
and, even as the Ca&s;e really &s;tands, it is an <HI>Accompli&s;hment, very
new, and Extraordinary,</HI> and mu&s;t be allow'd not unworthy of the
<HI>highe&s;t Admi|ration!</HI>&mdash;That heroic <HI>Roman</HI> Spirit, which
<HI>Horace</HI> &s;peaks of, in the Motto to my PAPER, went no farther than a
private applauding him&s;elf, at home, in Return for the <HI>Hi&s;&s;es,</HI>
which he met with, when abroad: But our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Firmne&s;s of Face,
can <HI>look Reproach in the Teeth,</HI> and per&s;evere, with as much
Negligence, and Satisfaction, as if we &s;uf|fer'd for our <HI>Exce&s;s of
Wit,</HI> what is levell'd at our <HI>Want of Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS favour'd many Months &s;ince, with a Sheet or Two, of
Excellent Reflexions, which were lo&s;t, by &s;ome Accident, and have been but
lately recover'd. The follow|ing Ob&s;ervations, &s;eem &s;o applicable to my
pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, that I cannot do better than borrow them, for Reproof of a
barbarous Cu&s;tom, which had &s;pread it&s;elf, <HI>too broad,</HI> among us,
before it appear'd on one of our <HI>Theatres.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194">AT <HI>Paris,</HI> and at
<HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> there is &s;carce a Week pa&s;&s;es, without &s;ome
<HI>Publick Execution</HI>; and yet, tho' there are <HI>News-Papers</HI> in
Abundance, we &s;eldom, or never, find any Account of that Sort, in
them.&mdash;They think, and perhaps ju&s;tly enough, That it is a Point of
National Credit, to conceal, with as much Decency as they can, the Enormities
of their Countrymen.&mdash;On the contrary, our Writers for the <HI>Day,</HI>
and the <HI>Week,</HI> watch with Earne&s;tne&s;s, for the Op|portunity, and
are &s;ure to pa&s;s by no &s;uch Subject.&mdash;It often makes a very Glaring
<HI>Paragraph</HI>; but is &s;ometimes unhappily &s;ci|tuated. I have
frequently known a <HI>Change at Court</HI> yok'd with a <HI>Remove at
Tyburn;</HI> and both follow'd, clo&s;e in the Rear, by an Account of &s;ome
<HI>Church-Advancement</HI>; or new-drawn <HI>Matrimonial Tye,</HI> among
People of Quality.</P>
<P>I ONLY hint at the&s;e Liberties, and de|&s;ire to deal gently
with my Contempora|ries.&mdash;There are other Wretches among us, who attend
the <HI>Gibbet,</HI> like Ravens, or Vul|tures, and expect their
<HI>Sub&s;i&s;tence</HI> from it.&mdash;Not a poor Criminal can be hang'd, but
they break open his expiring Lips, and rob him of his <HI>La&s;t Words.</HI>
When he has &s;uffer'd the Sentence of the <HI>Law,</HI> he is condemn'd,
afre&s;h, to a <HI>Libel:</HI> And is far from be|ing <HI>at Re&s;t,</HI> even
after he has &s;urrender'd his Life to the Halter, his Cloaths to the Hangman,
and his Body to the Sur|geons! <PB N="194" REF="195"> For, then, come the
Scribler, the Pamphleteer, and the <HI>Biographer</HI> of <HI>New|gate,</HI>
who <HI>draw</HI> out his Good Name, and <HI>quarter</HI> it; and hang up his
Reputation, in <HI>Effigie,</HI> They give him a <HI>Quarto,</HI> or an
<HI>Octavo</HI> Shrowd; and fringe, and flouri&s;h it with his <HI>Birth,</HI>
and <HI>Parentage.</HI>&mdash;Hence, the <HI>Ordinary,</HI> to pre&s;erve his
<HI>Perqui&s;ites,</HI> is driven upon the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>adverti&s;ing
again&s;t Counterfeits</HI>; and, has, &s;ometimes, no better Expedient, than
to publi&s;h the <HI>Po&s;thumous Works</HI> of his Communicants, <HI>even
before they are yet departed!</HI></P>
<P>TO be <HI>half-hang'd,</HI> has been the Ca&s;e of one or two
Sufferers; but to be <HI>twice hang'd,</HI> is a very great Hard&s;hip: And
when a Cri|minal's Account of <HI>Him&s;elf</HI> is &s;uppos'd to be
<HI>true,</HI> it &s;eems a Mifortune that They, who wilfully, <HI>belye,</HI>
him, &s;hould be permit|ted to &s;urvive him.&mdash;If the Sufferer can write
and read, then, be&s;ides his <HI>Birth,</HI> and <HI>Education,</HI> his
<HI>Tryal,</HI> and <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> we have <HI>his La&s;t Works, and
Compo&s;itions.</HI> If he is married, we have <HI>his Widow's
Lamen|tation.</HI> If he dies, troubled, and un&s;a|tisfied, we have <HI>his
Gho&s;t:</HI> And if his Life has been at all remarkable, we have <HI>His
Hi&s;tory, and Adventures.</HI>&mdash;Some ready Compiler of <HI>Newgate,</HI>
bundles up his <HI>Me|moirs,</HI> and de&s;cribes his Exploits, in &s;o
di&s;|creet, and adapted, Style, That the Plea|&s;antry of the Relation is more
apt to prevail, <PB N="195" REF="196"> on the <HI>Young,</HI> and the
<HI>Giddy</HI> (who are the common Readers of &s;uch Tracts) to
<HI>imitate</HI> a Life of &s;o much &s;eeming Heroick Extra|vagance, than to
take Example, from the fatal End of it.</P>
<P>I KNOW not whether &s;uch <HI>Expo&s;ing</HI> Me|thods as The&s;e,
are not &s;uffer'd to take Place, by Way of Advance upon the Lenity of our
<HI>Engli&s;h Executions</HI>; and as a Counterballance to the Foreign
Severities of <HI>Torture,</HI> and <HI>Mu|tilation.</HI> If there is any

<HI>knew</HI> them, for they were his Cu&s;tomers of five Years &s;tan|ding;

<Q> 
<P> AFTER having reflected on my Mi|&s;tre&s;s, and on Marriage, I
fell a&s;leep, and found my &s;elf in a <HI>Myrtle Grove,</HI> where &s;everal
<HI>Ways</HI> ran together into one Great Path, that led to the <HI>Temple of
Hy|men.</HI>&mdash;The Flowers, mo&s;t of which were <HI>Violets,</HI> and
<HI>bleeding Lovers,</HI> exhal'd a deli|cious Odour: And the Birds, that
warbled round me, help'd to fill the Scene with Tran&s;port.</P> 
<P> I OBSERV'D Crowds of Travellers, pa&s;|&s;ing onward; but none,
to my great Sur|prize, <HI>repa&s;&s;ing.</HI>&mdash;Upon looking a little
nearer, I di&s;cover'd Troops of flying Boys with Silver Wings, that hover'd
before them, for their <HI>Guides.</HI> There were Per|&s;ons of all Ranks, and
of both Sexes.</P> 
<P> I TOOK particular Notice of &s;ome, who tho' they &s;eem'd to
make more Ha&s;te then the re&s;t, were, at the End, the farthe&s;t
behind-hand. The&s;e, I heard, were call'd <HI>Coquets,</HI> in the Language of
the Country. <PB N="202" REF="203"> They &s;eem'd, to do nothing but &s;port,
and flutter about; without gaining any Ground, or <HI>de&s;iring</HI> to gain
any.</P> 
<P> THE next, I was told, were <HI>Prudes:</HI> And the&s;e had taken
a Bye-Path, and mov'd onward, toward the Temple, very &s;lowly; and, to all
Appearance, unwill|ingly; with their Necks fanta&s;tically re|verted, and their
Eyes looking back, upon the Country, they had newly pa&s;s'd through. Yet
The&s;e were the Fir&s;t that came up; and &s;lipt, &s;ilently into the
Temple!</P> 
<P> AMONG the Men, was a Troop, which &s;eem'd compos'd of the mo&s;t
expert Tra|vellers. My Guide inform'd me, They were call'd <HI>Hibernians.</HI>
They did many Things, I perceiv'd, very differently from the re&s;t: For, while
others led up but <HI>one</HI> Companion, to the Temple, the&s;e had
&s;eve|ral, in &s;everal Paths; and were the only Per&s;ons, who, after lodging
<HI>One,</HI> went out again, to conduct <HI>Another.</HI>&mdash;It was ea&s;y
to di&s;tingui&s;h them, however mingled in the Crowd, by the <HI>Shine</HI> of
a certain <HI>Metal,</HI> which had burni&s;h'd their Cheeks, and Fore|heads,
and ca&s;t a <HI>Gleam,</HI> like a <HI>Corinthian Vizard.</HI></P> 
<P> I WAS call'd off, by a confus'd Noi&s;e, at &s;ome Di&s;tance;
and made toward it, as well as I cou'd; but found &s;uch an Alte|ration in the
Air, that I cou'd not &s;tir one Step, without &s;neezing. This was a Troop of
<HI>Sword-Knots,</HI> and <HI>Cockades,</HI> di&s;playing <PB N="203" REF="204"> a powerful In&s;trument, that glitter'd much, and was call'd a
<HI>Snuff-Box.</HI> The Scuffle of Tongues was &s;o great, that I &s;taid not
long, among the <HI>Pretty Gentlemen,</HI> (for that was the Name they went by)
but pa&s;s'd on, to a Part of the Grove, whence there i&s;&s;ued a delightful
<HI>Harmony.</HI></P> 
<P> COMING thither, I ob&s;erv'd a Number, apart from the re&s;t,
with Harps in their Hands, which they touch'd, with tran&s;por|ting Melody.
Nine Godde&s;&s;es were mix'd among them: all mo&s;t ravi&s;hingly beauti|ful!
The&s;e happy Gentlemen, I found, were the Favourites of the Grove; but they
made no Ha&s;te to the Temple; rather wandering up and down, and making
<HI>Sal|lies</HI> into every Path, with an Air of agree|able Indifference.</P> 
<P> I LEFT them, and came up with a Troop of Clowdy, Haughty, and
Erect, Movers, di&s;tingui&s;h'd by <HI>peculiar Head-Pieces,</HI> which, at
Di&s;tance, look'd like <HI>Diadems.</HI> All the Female Travellers, they
chanc'd to meet with, receiv'd their Whi&s;pers with a kind of Triumph; and
li&s;ten'd to them with more Rapture, than even to the Voices of tho&s;e
<HI>Divine Mu&s;icians!</HI>&mdash;This Train was under the Care of two
Godde&s;&s;es, who&s;e Names were <HI>In&s;olence</HI> and <HI>Privilege!</HI>
I was now within the Sight of the Temple; but taking an Aver&s;ion, in my
Sleep, to the affected <HI>Struttings</HI> of this Company, I wak'd fortunately
out of my Dream, and re&s;olv'd to &s;end it to the PLAIN-DEALER.</P></Q>

<P>AN Evil Spirit had taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the
Villages, in <HI>Lapland,</HI> and turn'd the Inhabitants into <HI>Bears:</HI>
By which Means, being depriv'd of the <HI>Di&s;cretion</HI> of <HI>Humane
Creatures,</HI> and unable to provide for <HI>Them&s;elves</HI>; the King of
the Country committed them to the <HI>Keeping</HI> of two or three of his
<HI>Beef-Eaters</HI>; who took the Of|fice, with no other Pro&s;pect, than to
live at their Ea&s;e, on the <HI>Perqui&s;ites</HI> of it; and were
con&s;equently, more inclinable to provide Diet, to their <HI>own</HI> Ta&s;te,
than to that of the Meta|morphos'd <HI>Animals,</HI> which had been deli|ver'd
into their Cu&s;tody.&mdash;They had, how|ever, &s;o much Gratitude, for the
Profit, ac|cruing from their <HI>Grant,</HI> as to re&s;olve, That the poor
Creatures &s;hou'd want nothing, that was <HI>Strong</HI> and <HI>Savoury:</HI>
But they had not <PB N="205" REF="206"> the Judgment, to con&s;ider, That a
<HI>Man,</HI> when he becomes a <HI>Bear,</HI> requires a <HI>coar&s;er</HI>
Kind of Nouri&s;hment, than he was accu|&s;tomed to, while a <HI>Rational
Creature!</HI>&mdash;They gave 'em nothing to drink but <HI>Brandy</HI>; and
fed 'em with <HI>Cock-Broth,</HI> and <HI>Forc'd-Meats</HI>; 'till they, All,
grew giddy, and light-headed, and were taken with a dange|rous
<HI>Vertigo.</HI></P>
<P>A YOUNG Shepherd, who had been brought up a little
<HI>wildly</HI>; and, who, by li|ving much among Bea&s;ts, had acquainted
him&s;elf with the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Bears,</HI> under|took to <HI>Board
'em Cheaper</HI>; and built, and open'd, to that End, a <HI>New Hou&s;e of
Enter|tainment;</HI> where, for the &s;ame Rates which were paid his Rivals, he
treated the Ani|mals, in their own Way, with <HI>raw Hor&s;e Fle&s;h,</HI>
in&s;tead of <HI>Ragou&s;ts</HI>; and <HI>Spring Wa|ter,</HI> in the Place of
<HI>Brandy.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Bears</HI> were &s;trangely delighted, at a
Change, they were, &s;o able to reli&s;h; and flock'd, in Tran&s;|port, to
their <HI>New Ordinary</HI>; where they <HI>grinn'd,</HI> and grew
<HI>fat,</HI> upon a <HI>Diet,</HI> which was adapted to their Palates: So
that, in a little Time, not a <HI>Cub,</HI> of any <HI>Quality,</HI> cou'd make
a Meal, upon their <HI>Old Commons.</HI> And the poor Shepherd, who provided
for them, <HI>&s;o judiciou&s;ly,</HI> had all their Cu&s;tom, for the future,
and became Richer, than the <HI>King's own Bear-Wards!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207">How &s;uch an odd Story as this came in my
Way, I know not; But I will leave it, as I found it: For I am in a Humour to
talk of the <HI>Theatres.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Royal Company of Comedians</HI> differs from the
<HI>South-Sea-Company,</HI> the <HI>Bank,</HI> and other <HI>Acting
Companies,</HI> of this <HI>City,</HI> in this one Point, among more, That It
has <HI>Dire|ctors,</HI> but no <HI>Governour.</HI>&mdash;It is certain,
how|ever, that tho&s;e <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> whom they call their
<HI>Managers,</HI> have had all po&s;&s;ible Advan|tage on their Side. The
Court-Authority, and Countenance, went with them.&mdash;The <HI>Noble,</HI> and
the <HI>Ignoble,</HI> join'd in a long, and unrea&s;onable Partiality, to
&s;upport them, <HI>without Rivals</HI>; in direct Oppo&s;ition to the
Intere&s;t of their own Plea&s;ure; which is, un|doubtedly, be&s;t provided
for, when <HI>Rival Theatres</HI> contend, which &s;hall, mo&s;t de&s;erve
Encouragement.&mdash;It is worth while, then to examine, how they
<HI>lo&s;t</HI> this Advantage. And I take the Fact to be thus.</P>
<P>THE good <HI>Old Patentee,</HI> of the <HI>New Thea|tre</HI> died,
under a Length of Oppre&s;&s;ion; and left his <HI>Right,</HI> and his
<HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> to his <HI>Son</HI>; an Unfear'd, and Friendle&s;s Youth! of
whom it might then have been &s;aid, as of <HI>Chamont,</HI> in the
<HI>Orphan.</HI> 
<Q>His <HI>Hopes</HI> were <HI>all</HI> his Fortune!</Q></P>
<P>HE <HI>Open'd,</HI> again&s;t a Tide of <HI>Prejudice</HI>; and
acted many Years, not only, without <PB N="207" REF="208"> <HI>Favour,</HI> but
almo&s;t without <HI>Notice,</HI> at lea&s;t from the <HI>Fa&s;hionable

<HI>Plea&s;ing,</HI> without Succe&s;s!&mdash;He reviv'd the be&s;t old <HI>Old
Plays,</HI> and brought on &s;everal <HI>New Ones!</HI> but had, often the
Mortification to oppo&s;e his own <HI>Indu&s;try,</HI> and the &s;ublime&s;t
Scenes of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> to the cold Encouragement of <HI>Empty
Boxes!</HI>&mdash;What &s;hou'd he do, in this Ca&s;e?&mdash;The Torrent of
Opinion was <HI>again&s;t him.</HI> Good <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> and &s;olid
<HI>Thinking,</HI> were as U&s;ele&s;s to him as his
<HI>Boxkeepers!</HI>&mdash;At la&s;t, by a Quickne&s;s in his <HI>Natural
Wit;</HI> and a Satyri|cal Sharpne&s;s in his <HI>Ob&s;ervation,</HI> He
perceiv'd he had nothing to do, if he wou'd have the <HI>Game</HI> play'd into
his Hands, but to lay a&s;ide his <HI>Judgment,</HI> and abandon Him&s;elf to
his <HI>Fancy.</HI></P>
<P>IN Pur&s;uance of this lucky <HI>Di&s;covery,</HI> He compos'd a
<HI>New Species of Entertainment,</HI> which had an infinite deal of
<HI>Sen&s;e</HI> in them; but it was only the <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> of
<HI>Seeing.</HI>&mdash;It is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to conceive the
<HI>Ea&s;e,</HI> which this Reformation of the Stage gave the Bulk of our
<HI>Genteel Audiences</HI>!&mdash;They, cou'd, now, laugh out, without

Place!</HI> They felt no Weight of <HI>Words,</HI> which had formerly <HI>lain
heavy</HI> upon their <HI>Under&s;tandings:</HI> And, the Burden of their
<HI>Attention</HI> being, &s;o commodiou&s;ly, <HI>ligh|ten'd,</HI> they
<HI>came,</HI> and <HI>&s;aw,</HI> and were <HI>&s;atisfied.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="209">THE old <HI>Managers</HI> were indi&s;creet

<P>UPON my expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome Concern, That it was not rather a

<HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> of the <HI>Gentleman,</HI> whom he treats with &s;o

<P>I HAVE &s;omewhere, met with a Story of one of the ancient
Princes, of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> I think, it was ANTIOCHUS.&mdash;He was
hunting, and lo&s;t his Followers; and Night coming on, after a tedious
Wandering, over Heaths, and Fore&s;ts he came at la&s;t, to a little Cottage,
where the Poor People were at Supper, and enter|tain'd him, very chearfully, as
a Traveller, who had lo&s;t his way. The chief Subject of their Di&s;cour&s;e,
was concerning the <HI>King,</HI> and his <HI>Mini&s;ters.</HI>&mdash;As for
the <HI>King him&s;elf,</HI> they accus'd him of <HI>no Vices.</HI>&mdash;They
&s;poke of him with much Duty; and agreed, That he <HI>meant well,</HI> and was
de&s;irous of his Subject's Hap|pine&s;s: But he was not, they &s;aid, &s;o
ab&s;o|lutely, the <HI>Monarch</HI> of his <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> as of his
People: Submitting his own Sen&s;e of Affairs, <PB N="215" REF="216"> and the
Authority of his Determinations, to Men of le&s;s Vertue, and Under&s;tanding,
than Him&s;elf; and giving Way to Ea&s;e, and In|dolence, while he devol'd the
Power of his Office, on Wretches, who&s;e Hearts were too narrow, and their
Pa&s;&s;ions too violent, to de|&s;erve any Government at all; much le&s;s That
of a <HI>Kingdom</HI>!</P>
<P>THE King &s;aid little to all This; but laid it up, for his U&s;e,
and Benefit: And, in the Morning, when his Guards, and the Great Men, of his
Court, having follow'd the Track of his Hor&s;e, were come to him, at the
Cottage, he receiv'd them with this Declaration.&mdash;<HI>You are mi&s;taken,
if you &s;up|po&s;e, I have been, all Night, out of my Way.&mdash;I have &s;at
in Coun&s;el, with an A&s;&s;embly of the only Hone&s;t, and faithful
Advi&s;ers, I met with, &s;ince I became your Sovereign. Nor did I ever hear a
Word, of the True Condition of my Affairs before I learnt it, in this
Cottage.</HI></P>
<P>THE Condition of a Nation, where <HI>Mi|nions</HI> have their
Prince in <HI>Pupilage,</HI> is &s;o va&s;t|ly the <HI>Rever&s;e</HI> of
<HI>Ours,</HI> That a Di&s;cour&s;e, on &s;uch a Subject mu&s;t be forc'd to
draw <HI>Exam|ples,</HI> either from the Hi&s;tories of Foreign Countries, or
from our own, remov'd, far backward.&mdash;But, as the Ble&s;&s;ing of a
perfect <HI>Health</HI> is never better under&s;tood, and valued, than while he
who is &s;o happy as to enjoy it, employs him&s;elf in reading the
<HI>Symptoms,</HI> of &s;ome dangerous, and dread|ful <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI>
&s;o the Comfort, which we, <HI>Free</HI> <PB N="216" REF="217">
<HI>Britons</HI> mu&s;t receive, from a Compari&s;on, of our <HI>own
Happine&s;s,</HI> with the <HI>Mi&s;ery of Others,</HI> is an Argument, which
convinces me, that no Theme de&s;erves, more ju&s;tly, the Con&s;i|deration of
a PLAIN DEALER.</P>
<P>I WILL venture to lay it down, as a <HI>Maxim,</HI> That, where
the Soul of a <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> is not <HI>Great</HI> enough, to
<HI>overlook,</HI> and for|give, and to drown all <HI>Per&s;onal Regards,</HI>
in the Ocean of his <HI>Publick Cares,</HI> let his other <HI>Vertues,</HI> and
good <HI>Qualities,</HI> be never &s;o nu|merous, and &s;o &s;hining, he will
confound his Prince's Intere&s;t, with his own private Re|&s;entments.
In&s;tead of <HI>healing</HI> Divi&s;ions, he will <HI>inflame</HI> them; and,
by a Thou&s;and pa&s;&s;ionate <HI>Extravagancies,</HI> draw upon him&s;elf a
Univer&s;al <HI>Hatred</HI>; and upon his Sovereign, a <HI>Contempt,</HI> that
is the mo&s;t dangerous of all Motives to Sedition; and, what wi&s;e Princes
have been careful to guard them&s;elves again&s;t, by a <HI>Spirit,</HI> and
<HI>Activity,</HI> which, even where they have not been <HI>lov'd,</HI>
&s;erv'd, at lea&s;t, to make them <HI>fear'd</HI>; which is the <HI>next</HI>
&s;ure An|chor of <HI>Obedience.</HI></P>
<P>THE Be&s;t of Princes have had their <HI>Favou|rites:</HI> But, it
is the ea&s;ie&s;t Thing in the World to di&s;tingui&s;h the MINION from the
MINISTER. The MINISTER is his Prince's In&s;trument; The MINION makes an
In&s;trument of his Prince&mdash;Under a MINI|STER, the common Themes, of all
publick Conver&s;ation, are his Great De&s;igns, for the Ornament, or the
Intere&s;t of the Kingdom&mdash;<PB N="217" REF="218"> Benevolence, Mercy,
Wi&s;dom, <HI>Genero&s;ity,</HI> and <HI>Magnificence,</HI> flow down upon the
People, in a Current of new Laws, and Benefits.&mdash;On the contrary, under a
MINION, nothing is talk'd of, but his Subtlety, his Malice, and his
Avarice!&mdash;Little Weathercock <HI>Arti|fices,</HI> and temporary
<HI>Shifts,</HI> and <HI>Expedients,</HI> &s;tand in Place of a &s;teady
Policy, and a manly Cour&s;e of <HI>Equanimity.&mdash;Oppre&s;&s;ion, Pride,
Su&s;picion, Faction, Bitterne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Partiality,</HI> are the
Products of his Influence: And the <HI>Law,</HI> which &s;hou'd be the
Mea&s;ure of his Rule, is the No&s;e of Wax, to his Am|bition!&mdash;The
MINISTER takes Delight to inquire out Men of <HI>Learning,</HI> or of
<HI>Vertue,</HI> that his <HI>Bounty</HI> may rai&s;e them high enough to
&s;hine, like Stars, upon his Admini&s;trati|on!&mdash;The MINION hates
<HI>Di&s;cernment,</HI> be|cau&s;e he knows him&s;elf unfit to be look'd into;
and, therefore, appropriates Rewards, and Preferments, to the
<HI>Mercenary,</HI> and the <HI>Ignorant.</HI>&mdash;In &s;hort, the MINISTER
is <HI>wi&s;e</HI>; But the MINION is only <HI>cunning.</HI></P>
<P>IT is finely ob&s;erv'd by <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> in his
Di&s;cour&s;e concerning <HI>Government,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"That <HI>Monarchy,</HI> when its Power is
wi&s;ely divi|ded, among <HI>di&s;tinct Coun&s;els,</HI> none en|croaching on
the other's Boundaries, draws into it &s;elf all Advantages, which are
at|tainable by any of the <HI>Common-Wealth Sy&s;tems:</HI> But, is in nothing
&s;o weak, and un&s;table, as in the Folly of partial Kings, who, ruling by
their <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> in&s;tead of <PB N="218" REF="219"> their

them.</Q></P>
<P>SUCH a <HI>Political Mon&s;ter</HI> of a MINION, we read of, in
the <HI>Annals</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"In the Year Nine Hundred and Nineteen, (&s;ays
the Author, in his Second Book) <HI>Charles</HI> liv'd, as it were, alone, in
<HI>Soi&s;&s;ons</HI>; de&s;pis'd, and for&s;aken, by his <HI>Peers,</HI> on
Account of one <HI>HAGANON,</HI> of <HI>Laon</HI>; a Man, of <HI>vulgar
Extraction;</HI> but who was, &s;olely, tru&s;ted with the <HI>King's
Secrets;</HI> and without who&s;e Concurrence, no Mat|ter of Importance, cou'd
be done, either in the Court, or in the Kingdom. But the Credit of this <HI>New
Up&s;tart</HI> was the Cau&s;e of the King's Ruin; for the Great Men
re&s;olv'd, at la&s;t, no longer to endure, that &s;uch a ba&s;e Scoun|drel
&s;hou'd be exalted, over the Heads of the whole <HI>Nobility.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>HAGI-JUSOUF,</HI> a Governor of <HI>Arabia,</HI> under the
Reign of <HI>Caliph Abdulmelec,</HI> met with a Stroke of unexpected
<HI>Satyre,</HI> which gives a lively Repre&s;entation of the General
<HI>Odium,</HI> the&s;e bu&s;ie MINIONS are always de|&s;tin'd to live
under.&mdash;He was hated for his Cruelty, and Exactions; but carried,
never|thele&s;s, an <HI>Out&s;ide</HI> of Charity and Religion. 
<PB N="219" REF="220"> He met a <HI>Dervis,</HI> one Day, in the Street; and,
having &s;top't, to give him Alms, re|commended him&s;elf to his
<HI>Prayers.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Dervis,</HI> lifting up his Eyes, to Heaven,
cry'd out, with a loud Voice, <HI>Take him from us, O Great God! Take him from
us, I be&s;eech Thee!&mdash;Hagi-Ju&s;ouf</HI> was not &s;atisfied with the
Turn of this Prayer; and began to mur|mur at the <HI>Dervis:</HI> But the
<HI>Holy Plain Dea|ler</HI> replied, with great Earne&s;tne&s;s and
Humi|lity,&mdash;<HI>It is good for you, and for All the</HI>
Mu&s;&s;ulmans.</P>
<P>THE Truth is, there is an unavoidable Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, that Princes
&s;hou'd be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;uch Subjects as they think fit to Favour: But
it is happy, where the Ma&s;ter has <HI>Spirit,</HI> and the Servant
<HI>Moderation:</HI> For, in that Ca&s;e, the Mi&s;chief will be either
prevented, or cor|rected, before its Progre&s;s is become
con&s;idera|ble.&mdash;Opinion, and the Ob&s;tinancy of Rea|&s;oning, have made
a mighty Noi&s;e in the World, concerning the Differences between
<HI>Arbitrary</HI> and <HI>Limited</HI> Government: But, in the Nature of
Things, there is neither <HI>Ab&s;o|lute Power</HI> nor <HI>Freedom</HI>;
taking them in their full Sen&s;e.&mdash;Every <HI>Whale</HI> has its
<HI>little leading Fi&s;h,</HI> and follows it, with a Kind of unweildy
Ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s! This, in the <HI>Sea,</HI> has been thought a Wonder, but
few Things, on <HI>Land,</HI> are more u&s;ual, and familiar.&mdash;The mo&s;t
ter|rible, of the <HI>State Leviathans,</HI> have been ma|nag'd, and led along,
by a <HI>Wife,</HI> a <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> <PB N="220" REF="221"> a
<HI>Favourite,</HI> or &s;ome other &s;uch <HI>dimunitive Pilot</HI>: So that
in an unlimited Signification, there is no &s;uch Thing as
<HI>Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Grand Signior</HI> it is true, can cau&s;e any of his
Subjects to be <HI>Strangled,</HI> without a&s;&s;igning other Rea&s;ons for
it, than his <HI>Impe|rial Will, and Plea&s;ure.</HI> But, how &s;eldom is this
done, at his <HI>own mere Motion</HI>; and how often, at that of his
<HI>Vizier</HI>'s, and tyrannick <HI>Minions?&mdash;I my &s;elf,</HI> (&s;ays a
Writer of the la&s;t Age) <HI>have known &s;ome Sovereigns, &s;o far Strangers
to what was convenient, that they wou'd &s;carce grant, or deny, any Thing, out
of the Pre&s;ence of their</HI> Secretary.</P>
<P>THERE is but one <HI>Con&s;olation,</HI> which can give Men
Patience, while they are <HI>&s;uffering,</HI> under the In&s;olence of &s;uch
Up&s;tart Tyrants: And that is, their rea&s;onable Hope, that they &s;hall live
to &s;ee the <HI>Puni&s;hment,</HI> when the <HI>Guilt</HI> is ripe enough for
Vengeance&mdash;It is long, before a Prince can break out of the ob&s;curing
Mi&s;t, which an Evil Coun&s;ellor will conjure up, and involve him
in&mdash;But, when by Accident, or Reflection, he comes, at length, to clear
his Eye-&s;ight, and &s;ee Things, in their proper Colours, the
<HI>Minion,</HI> then fir&s;t, becomes a <HI>Benefit</HI> to the People he has
injur'd; for he leaves them a Protection, in the Example of his Fall, which may
guard them, in Times to come, again&s;t the Malice of a New Oppre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="222">THE la&s;t Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> was
one of the greate&s;t Monarchs, of his Age, and for nothing more celebrated,
than the Vigour, and Strictne&s;s, of his <HI>Ju&s;tice:</HI> But he was warm,

<SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I CONTRACTED a &s;trict Friend&s;hip, with a Gentleman: And we
liv'd toge|ther for &s;ome Time; during which he fell in Love with a Young
Lady, between who&s;e <HI>Body,</HI> and <HI>Mind,</HI> there &s;eems to be a
perpetual War, which of the Two, &s;hall appear <HI>mo&s;t
beautiful!</HI>&mdash;But &s;he was <HI>pro|mis'd,</HI> by her Relations, to
one, who&s;e <HI>For|tune</HI> is much Superior to my Friends.&mdash;Yet, he
had frequent Opportunity of <HI>Di&s;cover|ing</HI> his <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI>
but wanted Courage to <HI>declare,</HI> what he, as much wanted Power to
<HI>conceal,</HI> and, &s;o, was forc'd, in Search of <HI>Re&s;t,</HI> to
retire into the Country.</P>
<P> BUT Ab&s;ence, in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening, in|flam'd, and
rivetted, his Angui&s;h.&mdash;He re|turn'd to me, in great Di&s;order; and
deli|vering a Letter into my Hands, pre&s;s'd me, with the mo&s;t moving Words,
and Ge&s;tures, to convey it, privately, to the Lady's.</P>
<P> NOW, Sir, you mu&s;t not &s;tart, when I ask you this
Que&s;tion,&mdash;<HI>Whether I ought to deliver it?</HI> The Difficulty lies
here&mdash;I know, her Relations have a particular Aver&s;ion to this
Gentleman.&mdash;And they are Per&s;ons, to whom I owe a Thou&s;and Benefits,
and Obligations.&mdash;My <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> is dear to my
<HI>Soul,</HI>&mdash;and my <HI>Gratitude</HI> is due to my <HI>Honour.</HI> I
wou'd not <HI>appear to betray</HI> Tho&s;e <PB N="227" REF="228"> who have
&s;o &s;trong a Claim to my <HI>Since|rity.</HI>&mdash;On the other hand, I was
tender of &s;hocking the Delicacy, and Refinement, of a Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o
&s;acred as our <HI>Friend&s;hip.</HI> Love is ra&s;h, and di&s;tru&s;tful;
takes Alarm at every Trifle; and judges ha&s;tily, and with|out Rea&s;on. He
wou'd conclude, if I <HI>re|fus'd him,</HI> That his Peace, and Intere&s;t, are
of no Weight with me.&mdash;Wou'd he had thought of <HI>another Means</HI> of
conveying his Letter to the Lady!&mdash;But, now, &s;hou'd I advi&s;e him to
it, it wou'd look like Cold|ne&s;s in his Cau&s;e; and his Imagination wou'd
take Fire, with &s;o many fal&s;e Apprehen|&s;ions, That he cou'd never
pre&s;erve <HI>Temper,</HI> to con&s;ider, That he has pu&s;h'd me, where there
is no Nece&s;&s;ity for it, on the &s;ure&s;t Step by which I can incur the
Hatred, and the Reproaches, of a Family, to which I am indebted, for almo&s;t
every Thing, that For|tune favours me in!</P>
<P> IN this Struggle, between the Duties of <HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI>
and of <HI>Gratitude,</HI> I can come to no Re&s;olution. I have Friends
enough, on who&s;e Advice, in other Things, I &s;et a very con&s;iderable
Value: But, there is no Opi|nion, I wou'd follow &s;o &s;oon, in a Point of
this <HI>Nicene&s;s,</HI> as that of the PLAIN-DEALER. It is the fir&s;t
Reque&s;t I have ever made to you; and, I hope, you will not refu&s;e your
An&s;wer.&mdash;When I tell him who&s;e Determi|nation I act by, I am &s;ure,
it will &s;atisfie him: And, if you <HI>deny</HI> me, the Prejudice 
<PB N="228" REF="229"> may be Infinite.&mdash;Let me have but a &s;ingle
<HI>Paragraph,</HI> to direct me: Or, if that be too much, give me a
<HI>Yes,</HI> or a <HI>No,</HI> at the Bottom of One of your <HI>Papers</HI>;
and it &s;hall be enough, for one of your &s;incere&s;t Admi|rers,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>'METHINKS the Difficulty, in this Ca&s;e, is not &s;o great, as
the <HI>lively Painting</HI> which de&s;cribes it, makes it appear, upon a
fir&s;t View.&mdash;Since the Lover is &s;o worthy of the Lady, (if he had no
other Means of reaching, or being recommended to her, but thro' the Hands of
<HI>This Friend</HI>) my Corre&s;pondent, without all Doubt, wou'd have &s;tood
bound to deliver the Letter; and try the utmo&s;t of his Influence, to render
it &s;ucce&s;sful: And the rather, becau&s;e <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> only, and not
<HI>Merit,</HI> &s;eems to have recommended the <HI>Rival.</HI>&mdash;But,
&s;ince it is &s;o ea&s;y to find other Means, as effectual; and the Favours,
receiv'd by my Corre&s;pondent, from the Lady's Family, are &s;trong Motives
again&s;t his Friend's em|ploying him, where there is no vi&s;ible
Nece&s;|&s;ity, that confines the Choice to <HI>him only,</HI> he appears, to
me, a little <HI>mi&s;taken,</HI> when he &s;trips <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> of
that generous <HI>Freedom,</HI> without which, it can never &s;ub&s;i&s;t; and
puni&s;hes him&s;elf with &s;uch inward Conflicts, in Support of a
<HI>Delicacy</HI>;; which, tho' it <HI>beau|tifies</HI> the <HI>Face</HI> of
<HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> is rather the <HI>Dre&s;s,</HI> than the <HI>Body,</HI>
of it.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="230">OF all human Pa&s;&s;ions, this, of

(which is a Parity of Souls) and <HI>Affection,</HI> which is a Claim of Blood;
or a Tye of mutual Intere&s;ts; or an Agreement, of Hopes, or Fears, or

<HI>Limits,</HI> in the <HI>Body,</HI> and exert her&s;elf, in generous

<HEAD>To the <HI>AUTHOR</HI> of the <HI>PLAIN DEALER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> HAVING lately met with an Op|portunity of looking back, upon a
Compleat <HI>SETT</HI> of your PLAIN DEALERS, the la&s;t Paragraph, in your
<HI>Paper</HI> of <HI>Mon|day,</HI> the 9th of <HI>November,</HI> puts me upon
asking, Whether it would not be worth while, to be&s;tow an <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI>
to &s;hew the <HI>Honour,</HI> as well as the <HI>Profit</HI> of
<HI>TRADE</HI>; in order to remove that mi&s;taken Motion, which
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Minds of the <HI>Indolent,</HI> and <HI>Unthinking,</HI>
Part of our Nobility and Gentry, <HI>That by engaging in TRADE they degrade
them&s;elves?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="233"> YOU will ea&s;ily prove the
<HI>contrary,</HI> &s;ince not only our <HI>Credit</HI> at Home, but our
<HI>Pow|er</HI> Abroad, is &s;upported by it. Be&s;ides which, the Education,
nece&s;&s;ary to qualify a Man for a compleat <HI>Trader,</HI> is &s;uch, as
becomes a Gentleman of the fir&s;t Rank. For he &s;hould be a Proficient in
<HI>Languages, Hi&s;tory, Geography,</HI> and <HI>Mathematicks:</HI> And, in
order to be Ma&s;ter of the Improve|ments, which may be made, in every Soil,
and Climate, he &s;hould know &s;omething of <HI>Natural
Philo&s;ophy.</HI>&mdash;He ought to be ac|quainted with the <HI>Policy</HI>
and <HI>Government,</HI> of all Nations: And, though he does not immediately
concern him&s;elf in the Ma|nagement of <HI>State Affairs,</HI> yet he &s;hould
be <HI>qualified</HI> for a <HI>PRIME MINISTER.</HI></P>
<P> OUR Youth of <HI>Title</HI> and <HI>Gaiety,</HI> are generally
taken with the Character of a <HI>SOLDIER</HI>; and it mu&s;t be allowed, a
<HI>Noble Employment,</HI>&mdash;E&s;pecially, when a&s;|&s;umed in the Defence
of our Country. But then, it may be remembred, That the Art of <HI>War,</HI>
was introduced thro' the <HI>Corruption</HI> of Mankind, and is always attended
with <HI>Ruin</HI> and <HI>De&s;olation.</HI></P>
<P> OTHERS, who would appear more polite than their Neighbours,
breed up their Sons to practice the <HI>LAW,</HI>&mdash;but I am &s;orry to
&s;ay, that <HI>This,</HI> con&s;idered as a <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> is is
attended with Con&s;equencs, as Fatal to Families, as <HI>That</HI> is to
Nations.&mdash;For, <PB N="233" REF="234"> though our <HI>Seats</HI> of
<HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> are filled with Men, from whom we may expect All, that is
equal and ju&s;t; yet by the <HI>Turns,</HI> and <HI>Managements,</HI> of the
inferiour Practicers in tho&s;e Courts, our Approach to Them, is made &s;o
<HI>Intricate</HI> and <HI>Expen&s;ive,</HI> that they who are obliged to &s;ue
for their own Right, in the common Forms, are frequently <HI>un|done,</HI> even
though they obtain the <HI>Verdict,</HI> in their <HI>Favour.</HI></P>
<P> THUS the Properties of the People are render'd precarious, and
many Difficulties are put upon them, in their Pur&s;uit of <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI>
by tho&s;e, who pervert the true <HI>In|tention</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI>; and
make That a dark <HI>My&s;tery,</HI> which being the Rule of every Man's
Actions, <HI>&s;hould lie open, and plain to his Under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P> AND, here, I cannot help mentioning a Thing, which, though it
&s;eems but a Tri|fle, much be allowed to look like a very unrea&s;onable
Hard&s;hip.&mdash;The Manner of making out, and &s;erving a <HI>Subpoena</HI>
in <HI>Chancery!</HI>&mdash;This is a &s;mall Slip of Parchment, roll'd up, in
a Lump of Wax, and may chance to be &s;erv'd, in the Coun|try, upon a Per&s;on,
who can hardly read the plaine&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI>&mdash;When it comes to
his Hands, perhaps, at fir&s;t, he is <HI>affraid to break it open</HI>; but,
if he proves <HI>hardy</HI> enough to do that, he is not one Jot the wi&s;er;
for it is wrote in <HI>Barbarous Latin,</HI> with odd unintelligble,
<HI>Abbreviations</HI>; and, in a <PB N="234" REF="235"> Hand, more
re&s;embling a Set of <HI>Hierogly|phicks,</HI> than the Letters of a
<HI>Chri&s;tian Al|phabet.</HI></P>
<P> THE poor Man, thinking no Harm, lays it by, till his
Convenience &s;erves him, to get it <HI>explained,</HI> by the fir&s;t
<HI>Great Scholar</HI> he happens to meet with. But, in the mean Time, upon
this Delay, out comes an <HI>Attachment,</HI> and &s;o on, to a <HI>Writ</HI>
of <HI>Re|bellion</HI>; for no other Rea&s;on than that a Man who was bred to
under&s;tand nothing but <HI>Husbandry,</HI> could not decypher a Sum|mons,
&s;erved upon him, in a <HI>Language</HI> he never heard of, and a
<HI>Character,</HI> which the Par&s;on of the Pari&s;h, might him&s;elf, have
been equally puzzled by!</P>
<P> THERE are many other Proceedings in the <HI>Law,</HI> of a like
Nature, which if truly con&s;idered, have methinks, but an <HI>odd</HI>
Ap|pearance, in a Country of &s;o much <HI>boa&s;ted Liberty.</HI>&mdash;But
if, while we cen&s;ure, what &s;eems thus unrea&s;onable, in the Method of
&s;ome of our <HI>Law-Practices,</HI> it &s;hould be alledged, That,
Notwith&s;tanding all this, it has produced many Great, and U&s;eful Men, <HI>I
allow it,</HI>&mdash;only it may be worth con&s;idering, Whether we have not
more Rea&s;on to be <HI>a&s;hamed we &s;tand in need of them,</HI> than to
boa&s;t that we <HI>have them.</HI> And I will ask this plain Que&s;tion, If
that would not be e&s;teemed a <HI>happier Climate,</HI> where there is no Need
of <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> than where the Uncertainty, or Unwhole&s;ome|ne&s;s 
<PB N="235" REF="236"> of the Air has encourag'd &s;o many of them to &s;ettle,
that you are &s;ure of finding a Good One in every Street?</P>
<P> I BEG Pardon for this Digre&s;&s;ion; but I was led into it by
mentioning the <HI>Law</HI> as a <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> compared with that of
the <HI>Mer|chant,</HI> in order to engage your more able Pen to &s;how, at
large, how much <HI>One</HI> is preferrable to the <HI>other</HI>; as well with
re|&s;pect to the <HI>Honour,</HI> as the <HI>U&s;efulne&s;s,</HI> that attends
it&mdash;&s;ince All, who rai&s;e their For|tunes meerly by the Practice of the
<HI>Law,</HI> or the Succe&s;s of the <HI>Sword,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily
do it upon the <HI>Ruin</HI> of <HI>Families</HI> and <HI>Nations:</HI> Whereas
the Generous <HI>TRADER,</HI> while he enriches <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> is
&s;preading Be|nefits to all about him: From whence we may infer, That
<HI>This</HI> is the Employment, mo&s;t agreeable to the <HI>Original
De&s;ign</HI> of our <HI>Beings,</HI> which was, not to <HI>de&s;troy,</HI> but
to <HI>comfort,</HI> and <HI>cheri&s;h</HI> each other.</P>
<P> <HI>MOSES</HI> was a great <HI>Lawgiver,</HI> and
<HI>David</HI> was a <HI>Warriour:</HI> But <HI>SOLOMON,</HI> whom GOD was
plea&s;ed to honour, with &s;till &s;ublimer Marks of his Favour, and to whom
He gave the <HI>wi&s;e&s;t,</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>Under|&s;tanding
Heart;&mdash;So that there was none like him, BEFORE, neither &s;hould Any
ri&s;e, AFTER, like unto him.</HI> This <HI>Solomon,</HI> the Greate&s;t King,
the Cho&s;en People of GOD ever had! was a <HI>MERCHANT</HI>; and &s;ent
Fleets, by way of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> to bring home <HI>Gold,</HI> from the
<HI>Ea&s;t Indies:</HI> And <PB N="236" REF="237"> what <HI>Noble
Monuments</HI> did this Prince leave behind him of his <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and
his <HI>Gran|deur:</HI></P>
<P> BUT we have a living Example in the <HI>CZAR,</HI> a Prince,
who has done more for the Advantage of his Country, and his own Glory, by
encouraing <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> and improving every Branch of
<HI>Trade,</HI> in his Dominions, than by all the <HI>Battles</HI> he has ever
fought.&mdash;In fine, <HI>who</HI> has not ob&s;erv'd, That <HI>our own mo&s;t
Gracious</HI> SOVEREIGN, at the opening this pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion of

</LETTER>
<P>I AM perfectly in the Sentiments of the Ingenious Gentleman, who
&s;ent me the fore|going Letter;&mdash;But, the Subject which he has
recommended, can never hope to &s;ucceed better, than under the Care of &s;o
able a Hand, as his own: And, for that Rea&s;on, I am very de&s;irous of the
Continuance of his Corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="238">THE Opinion, That <HI>Merchandizing
deba|&s;es Blood,</HI> is a Folly, worthy only of the <HI>Tribe,</HI> to whom
this Gentleman imputes it.&mdash;It is a Truth, too well known, that the
INDOLENT and UNTHINKING, <HI>Part,</HI> of our <HI>Nobility</HI> and
<HI>Gentry,</HI> is a very <HI>large</HI> Part of them: But (Heaven be
prais'd!) not at all a <HI>con&s;iderable One.</HI>&mdash;They are a Race of
<HI>plea|&s;ant Creatures,</HI> who had the Honour to be born, for their
<HI>own Ea&s;e</HI>; but for the <HI>Enter|tainment</HI> of other
People.&mdash;They put me in mind of the Innkeeper in the STRATAGEM, who was
able <HI>at pre&s;ent,</HI> to produce none of the <HI>Good Things,</HI> his
Gue&s;ts wanted, but had the Satisfaction of, remembring that he could have
furni&s;h'd 'em, All, <HI>if they had din'd with him, la&s;t SUNDAY:&mdash;No
Matter how pur-blind</HI> a Man of <HI>Quality</HI> happens to be, &s;ince he
had a <HI>Great Grandfather,</HI> that was <HI>&s;harp &s;ighted!</HI> He may
<HI>be, a Fool too,</HI> (HIM|SELF)&mdash;but it ought to be <HI>Scandalum
Mag|natum</HI> to laugh at him.&mdash;For he has <HI>Proofs,</HI> in the
<HI>Herald's Office,</HI> That his FOREFATHERS cou'd <HI>act wi&s;ely.</HI></P>
<P>WE have the Comfort, however, to know, that <HI>All</HI> our
<HI>Lords,</HI> are not LORDS OF TRADE: If they <HI>were,</HI> my
Corre&s;pondent's Excellent Notions might be urg'd, with an Effect, but
ill-proportion'd to their Value; and fall un|der the <HI>Noble Eye</HI> of not
a Few able Mini|&s;ters, of the &s;ame Stamp with a famous One, in a late
Reign, who, when a certain Knight, a Great Trader, pre&s;ented him with a
<HI>Scheme</HI> <PB N="238" REF="239"> <HI>for the Improvement of
Commerce,</HI> threw it back to him, with a <HI>wi&s;e Contempt,</HI> and ask'd
him, <HI>Whether he thought, that Men of HIS QUALITY, had nothing to do but to
read Papers!</HI></P>
<P>TO the ju&s;t, and lively, Ob&s;ervation, <HI>That a Merchant
ought to be qualify'd for a Mini|&s;ter of State,</HI> I will add this Wi&s;h,
of my own,&mdash;That we may, never have a <HI>Mini&s;ter of State,</HI> who is
not <HI>qualified for a Merchant!</HI>&mdash;Not <HI>Trade</HI> alone, but
<HI>Politicks,</HI> would &s;oon feel the Benefit of &s;o <HI>new</HI> a
Regulation.&mdash;Yet, there is a Happine&s;s, <HI>&s;till greater</HI>; and it
is the <HI>La&s;t,</HI> the <HI>warme&s;t, Hope,</HI> of tho&s;e, to who&s;e
&s;ucce&s;sful Indu&s;try we owe our <HI>Com|merce!&mdash;That the Way might
always lie open, to the Ear of our Princes Them&s;elves,</HI> without
pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>narrow Po&s;terns,</HI> which <HI>Truth</HI> is often
oblig'd to <HI>wait at,</HI> 'till it has wearied it &s;elf, to no
Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Fir&s;t remarkable <HI>Start,</HI> in the En|largement of the
<HI>Engli&s;h Traffick,</HI> was made in the Reign of our High-&s;pirited
<HI>Queen Eli|zabeth:</HI> And to what Kind of Mea&s;ures it was owing, may, I
pre&s;ume, be gather'd, without much Difficulty, from the following little
Story, which I have taken out of Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e,
concerning the <HI>Prerogative of Parliaments.</HI></P>
<Q> QUEEN <HI>Elizabeth</HI> would &s;et the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of her
<HI>meane&s;t Subject,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Authority</HI> of her
<HI>greate&s;t Councellor.</HI> By her Patience, <PB N="239" REF="240"> herein,
&s;he rai&s;ed the ordinary <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> above
<HI>Fifty thou&s;and Pounds a Year,</HI> without any new
Impo&s;ition.&mdash;The Lord Trea&s;urer <HI>Burleigh,</HI> the Earl of
<HI>Lei|ce&s;ter,</HI> and Secretary <HI>Wal&s;ingham</HI> (All <HI>Three
PENSIONERS</HI> to Cu&s;tomer <HI>Smith)</HI> join'd, to &s;et them&s;elves

<HI>Car|warden</HI>; and commanded the Grooms of the Chamber not to give him
Admi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;But the Queen, &s;ent for him, on a Peti|tion, which he
deliver'd, into her Hands, and gave him Countenance <HI>again&s;t them
all.</HI>&mdash;It would not &s;erve the Turn <HI>with Her,</HI> to be told by
her Great Officers, that &s;he <HI>di&s;grac'd Them,</HI> by allowing her Ear
to the Complaints of <HI>bu&s;ie Heads</HI>; and that &s;he di&s;honour'd Her
<HI>own Dignity.</HI>&mdash;She had al|ways This, to an&s;wer&mdash;<HI>That,
If Men &s;hou'd complain, unju&s;tly, again&s;t her Mini&s;ters, &s;he knew
well enough, how to puni&s;h them&mdash;But, if they had Rea&s;on for the
Complaints they offer'd Her, She was Queen of the SMALL, as well as of the
GREAT; and would not &s;uffer Her&s;elf to be BESIEG'D, by Ser|vants, who cou'd
have no Motive for wi&s;hing it, but their Intere&s;t in the Oppre&s;&s;ion of
others</HI></Q>

<P>I THINK, I have already inform'd my READERS, That I am a great

<P> I FEAR, if I make a Scrutiny into the Conduct of my Life, I
&s;hall di&s;grace my blu&s;hing <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> by a Recollection of my
<HI>Vanity.</HI>&mdash;The Tenderne&s;s of my <HI>Infant Years</HI> was too

That I was ent'ring upon a <HI>Wilderne&s;s,</HI> of <HI>Mi&s;ery!</HI></P> 
<P> IN the <HI>Boyi&s;h</HI> Years, which &s;ucceeded
<HI>Childhood,</HI> I drew in Plea&s;ure, at my Eyes, and Ears; and gave my
Soul a <HI>Tincture</HI> that prepared it for the Impre&s;&s;ions of fu|ture
Levity.&mdash;<HI>Riches, Honour,</HI> and <HI>worldly Greatne&s;s,</HI>
glitter'd on me, from a lovely <HI>Di&s;tance:</HI> And <HI>Retirement,</HI>

who were reputed <HI>wi&s;e&s;t,</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t happy.</HI></P> 
<P> AT my Entrance into <HI>Youth,</HI> I applied my&s;elf to
<HI>Study.</HI>&mdash;I delighted, chiefly, in <HI>Rhetorick,</HI> and
<HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI>; and, having the good Fortune to meet with Excellent
Ma&s;ters, I made a &s;wift, and unu&s;ual Pro|gre&s;s.&mdash;Yet I cannot help
confe&s;&s;ing, That it added Fuel to my native Pride. It inflam'd me with a

<P> FOR a while, I was very Earne&s;t in the Study of
<HI>Morality</HI>; and delighted in it &s;o much, that I publi&s;h'd a
Treati&s;e, on that Subject: And, afterwards, when I was come to Man's
E&s;tate, I compos'd, in Obe|dience to my Father's particular Command, an
Elaborate <HI>Hi&s;tory, of my Country.</HI>&mdash;But, while I labour'd to
contribute toward the Glory of other Men, I pleas'd my&s;elf

<HI>Pa|tience, Humility, Mediocrity,</HI> and <HI>Self-denial,</HI> are the

<Q> 
<P> THE Wi&s;e Author of Nature gave us <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> for a
noble End: And, to defend us from <HI>Exce&s;s,</HI> our
<HI>Under&s;tand|ings</HI> were conferred, to <HI>regulate</HI> them; And,
lea&s;t All &s;hould prove deficient, out of His overflowing Goodne&s;s, He
enriched us with a <HI>Revelation.</HI></P> 
<P> THE Eternal Truths of the Chri&s;tian Religion, ca&s;t a
<HI>Shade</HI> upon the fine&s;t, and <PB N="250" REF="251"> mo&s;t exalted,
Productions of <HI>humane Lite|rature:</HI> Which Remark has been fre|quently
brought, as a Defence of its <HI>Di|vine</HI> Original, and is really, a very
<HI>&s;trong Argument</HI>; for who can imagine, that without
<HI>&s;upernatural</HI> A&s;&s;i&s;tance, Men of ordinary Condition,
una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Lights, or Improvements, of <HI>Learning,</HI> &s;hould
be able, in various Languages, to lay down &s;uch <HI>invaluable
Principles;</HI> a Mul|titude of which, were va&s;tly preferrable, to any that
had been introduced, by the mo&s;t penetrating of the <HI>Heathen
Philo&s;o|phers.</HI></P> 
<P> <HI>SOCRATES, Plato, Epictetus,</HI> and &s;everal others, have
<HI>thought,</HI> and <HI>written,</HI> &s;o well, that their Memories
de&s;erve to be highly re&s;pected; But what <HI>nobler,</HI> and inimitable
<HI>Morals!</HI> How Ex|ten&s;ive, and yet adapted, to all Abilities, have
de&s;cended to us in the <HI>Divine Col|lections?</HI>&mdash;I have often, with
no &s;mall Concern, lamented, that the Study of the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> is
&s;o little reli&s;h'd; I had like to have &s;aid, &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed, in
in Compari&s;on of the <HI>Pagan</HI> Writers.</P> 
<P> IN the <HI>Schools,</HI> to open an Aquaintance, with the
Polite&s;t of the <HI>Cla&s;&s;icks,</HI> is un|doubtedly a commendable
<HI>Out&s;et.</HI> But to be taught, a greater Admiration of them, than of the
<HI>Prophets,</HI> and <HI>In&s;pir'd Wri|ters,</HI> is an <HI>Extream</HI>;
and one, that is, more than ordinary <HI>Criminal.</HI>&mdash;How com|mon 
<PB N="251" REF="252"> is it, to hear Per&s;ons expre&s;&s;ing their utmo&s;t
Fondne&s;s for the Former, whil&s;t the La&s;t is &s;eldom mentioned; or,
how|ever, with much <HI>Indifference.</HI> There are <HI>&s;ublime</HI>
Sentiments in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Authors;&mdash;But there is
&s;omething, too, which, I cannot forbear to take Notice of, that their
<HI>Characters</HI> were &s;eldom &s;uitable;&mdash;One Proof of which
A&s;&s;ertion, we may borrow from <HI>Plutarch</HI>'s Life of <HI>Cato</HI>;
Even that <HI>Cato</HI> who was famous for the rigid Stubbornne&s;s of his
Morality!&mdash;When his Dome&s;ticks were worn out with hard La|bour, or grown
pa&s;t it, through Encrea&s;e of Age, he would di&s;mi&s;s them, and &s;how no
Tokens of further Regard or Huma|nity: On which <HI>Plutarch</HI> has left us
this Reflection, <HI>That we are not to u&s;e unfortu|nate Wretches, who depend
on us; as we do our</HI> old Shooes, <HI>or</HI> Platters, <HI>and throw them
away, when they are</HI> broken, <HI>and fall to Pieces in our
Service:</HI>&mdash;But if it were for nothing better than to expre&s;s the
Re&s;pect, we have for the <HI>Humane Nature,</HI> a Man ought always to
cheri&s;h in him&s;elf a kind and compa&s;&s;ionate Di&s;po&s;ition.</P> 
<P> BUT, not to digre&s;s farther, There are <HI>infinitely
Sublimer</HI> Sentiments in the <HI>Sacred Writings,</HI> and the Lives of
their Authors &s;hone, illu&s;trious Examples of their Doct|rine!&mdash;How
becoming a great Soul, is, <HI>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,
Ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the Lord</HI>&mdash;<PB N="252" REF="253"> Again,
<HI>What? &s;hall we receive Good at the Hand of God, and &s;hall we not
receive Evil?</HI>&mdash;How Happy would it be for Mankind? if they would feel,
and ap|ply, to their Practice, the glorious Com|mands of our Redeemer, <HI>To
do nothing, but as we would be done by</HI>; to exerci&s;e our Benignity even
towards tho&s;e, who <HI>hate,</HI> and who <HI>per&s;ecute</HI> us! This
Propo&s;ition is contemned by too many, tho' we have it &s;o &s;trongly
recommended, not only by the <HI>Words,</HI> but by the <HI>Practice</HI> of
Him, who <HI>died</HI> for our Salvation! Be|&s;ides, (as you have ob&s;erv'd
in one of your PLAIN DEALERS) a Return of <HI>Good Offices,</HI> for
<HI>Injuries,</HI> is, indeed, the &s;harp|e&s;t <HI>Revenge</HI>; For by
&s;uch a Conduct, we triumph over, confound, and di&s;grace, a malicious Enemy:
As by a contrary Management, we &s;eem to <HI>ju&s;tify,</HI> as well as
<HI>inflame</HI> him.</P> 
<P> IN Fine, There are a beautiful Variety of In&s;tructions, in Holy
Writ, which can never be parallell'd; They manife&s;t their Heavenly Original;
And, if we make 'em our Delight, will alleviate all earthly Calamity, and
furni&s;h an infallible Re|medy, for every Accident, that can befal Us. I
de&s;ign'd now to have ended; but Recollecting, that there are &s;ome, who have
little <HI>Faith,</HI> in <HI>Revelation,</HI> I'll go on, a Line or two
farther;&mdash;Suppo&s;e, we grant their <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent
Hypothe&s;is:</HI> Yet, <PB N="253" REF="254"> &s;till, it is our Intere&s;t to
direct our&s;elves, by the Mea&s;ures of <HI>Revealed Religion,</HI> be|cau&s;e
it is the true&s;t Friend to humane Nature, and promotes nothing which is not
conducive to our Quiet, and Well-be|ing; &s;o that, allowing it were not our
<HI>Duty,</HI> it is, however our <HI>Prudence,</HI> to comply with &s;o
excellent, and even &s;o <HI>agreeable a Model.</HI></P> </Q>
<P>SO far, I have entertain'd my Readers with &s;ome Reflexions, for
which I am oblig'd to an unknown Hand, on a Subject, where|on much has already
been written; with le&s;s Effect than might rea&s;onably have been ex|pected,
from the Force, and Clearne&s;s, of the Arguments.</P>
<P>IF I am not mi&s;taken, That <HI>Di&s;reli&s;h</HI> of the
<HI>Sacred Writings,</HI> which my Corre&s;pon|dent complains of (tho' I hope
it is far from Univer&s;al among us) may be imputed to the low <HI>Spirit,</HI>
and flat, ob&s;olete, <HI>Expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> of the <HI>coar&s;e
Engli&s;h,</HI> they are <HI>tran&s;lated</HI> in.&mdash;I leave it (&s;ays an
Excellent Modern Critick) to our Prelates and Pa&s;tors, to con&s;ider,
Whether, &s;ince they are &s;atisfied, That there is a Nece&s;&s;ity for a
<HI>Numerous Style,</HI> in &s;ome Parts of our <HI>Publick Wor&s;hip,</HI>
they ought to remain contented with the <HI>Vile Ver&s;ions,</HI> now in U&s;e,
and &s;uffer the mo&s;t lofty, and mo&s;t pathetick Idea's of
<HI>Religion,</HI> to be <HI>burle&s;qu'd,</HI> in our Churches?&mdash;which is
all one, as if they &s;hou'd dre&s;s up a <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> in &s;ome
<HI>an|tick-Habit,</HI> <PB N="254" REF="255"> and expo&s;e him, every
<HI>Sunday, in That merry Garb,</HI> to rai&s;e the <HI>Veneration</HI> of the

<P>IT is finely ob&s;erv'd, and indeed, unde|niably demon&s;trated,
by the &s;ame Gentle|man, in his <HI>Grounds of Critici&s;m in Poetry,</HI>
That, as the Great <HI>Characteri&s;tick of Poetry,</HI> is
<HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> and the &s;tronge&s;t, and mo&s;t mov|ing Pa&s;&s;ions
flow mo&s;t naturally, from <HI>Reli|gious Idea's</HI>; For this Rea&s;on
chiefly, the <HI>An|cient Poetry</HI> (where their <HI>Religion</HI> had its
mo&s;t powerful Influence) has, &s;o vi&s;ibly the Advantage over the
<HI>Modern,</HI> (which is for the mo&s;t Part <HI>light, prophane,</HI> and
<HI>contemp|tible.)</HI> And, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on too, the <HI>Poetry</HI>
of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> which the <HI>Old Te&s;ta|ment</HI> is, every where,
fill'd with, excell'd That of the Antient <HI>Greeks</HI> and
<HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are numberle&s;s In&s;tances, in the <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> and
among the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and in|deed throughout all Parts of the
<HI>Old,</HI> and <HI>New Te&s;taments,</HI> of a <HI>Sublimity,</HI> that
exalts the Humane Soul, and &s;hakes it, with a much &s;tronger Degree of
<HI>Terror,</HI> and <HI>Admi|ration,</HI> than Any, the mo&s;t noble Strokes
of rapturous <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> which can be met with even in <HI>Homer
Him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT a <HI>Collection</HI> of <HI>dreadful Images</HI> are thrown
together in the <HI>Eighteenth P&s;alm,</HI> to de&s;cribe the Maje&s;ty of

Heavens, and comes</HI> <PB N="255" REF="256"> <HI>down,&mdash;and Darkne&s;s

follows, is a Conception, of &s;o immen&s;e, and terrible a Grandeur! that our

Inju&s;tice it has done the Mean|ing; <HI>Then the Channels of the Waters were

<P> THE Day had been fair, and clear; but, in the Evening, about
Six, it blew hard at South and by We&s;t. The Gale increas'd, into a violent
Storm, and continu'd for about Seven Hours, veering to the We&s;t, and North

down; becau&s;e the Sea ran &s;o high, that it broke over the Boat, and

was.</HI></P>
<P> FOR &s;ome Time, he pre&s;s'd her, in <HI>vain</HI>; but
prevail'd with her, at length, to come up with him upon Deck; where the fir&s;t
Ob&s;ervation they made, was, <HI>That the Boat was out of Sight</HI>; having
been beaten off, by the Force of the <HI>Swell,</HI> that ro&s;e between her
and the Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="266"> HE was Gazing, Speechle&s;s, on her Face,

and pa&s;&s;ing, providentially near their Captain, who was yet faintly
Swimming, the Men di&s;cern'd him, in the Sea, and took him up quite Spent, and
Speechle&s;s: In which Conditi|on, they laid him in the Bottom of the Boat; and
coming along the Ship's Side, one of the Sailors looking up, &s;aw &s;ome|thing

her; And they were &s;o <HI>Fortunate,</HI> in their Humanity, that they found

<P> SINCE my <HI>Misfortune</HI> ari&s;es only from my having
<HI>&s;ucceeded,</HI> to the ful|le&s;t Point of my own, and my Friend's
<HI>Wi&s;hes,</HI> I know not how, in Con&s;cience, I can expect your
<HI>Pity</HI>; but, be that as it will, my Ca&s;e is &s;omewhat extraordinary;
and I &s;hall fairly <HI>&s;tate</HI> it, with the Pur|po&s;e of &s;erving as a
<HI>Buoy,</HI> for the Warn|ing of others:&mdash;You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> know, Sir,
I was left an <HI>Orphan,</HI> under the Tuition of a Rich Uncle, who promis'd
to &s;ettle his whole E&s;tate upon me at the Day of my Marriage: And that he
might not <HI>cramp</HI> me in my Choice (a Folly too frequently attending the
Caprices of <HI>Old Age)</HI> the only Article he in&s;i&s;ted on, was a
<HI>Woman of</HI> <PB N="268" REF="269"><HI> &s;trict Vertue:</HI>&mdash;A
Condition, &s;o very <HI>rea&s;onable,</HI> was &s;ure to meet with an ea&s;ie
Compliance: And I, &s;o <HI>punctually,</HI> and <HI>exactly,</HI> ob&s;erv'd
it, that from the <HI>overflow|ing</HI> of my <HI>Wife's Vertue,</HI> my
Happine&s;s lies under Water.</P>
<P> WHATEVER Mi&s;management, or Folly, &s;he happens to be guilty
of, &s;he can im|mediately &s;et to rights, by the Counter|poize of her
<HI>Cha&s;tity:</HI> And I have no &s;ooner <HI>open'd my Mouth, than &s;he
hits me in the Teeth with her</HI> VIRTUE, the con|&s;cious Good Fortune of
<HI>coming off, without Cuckoldom,</HI> is, it &s;eems <HI>a Cordial
Prepara|tive,</HI> that can defend a Husband's Palate again&s;t the bitter
Ta&s;te of <HI>Arrogance, Pride, Vanity, Ill-Nature,</HI> and the re&s;t of
That long Catalogue, which <HI>Female Purity</HI> is pleas'd, &s;ometimes, to
arm it &s;elf with|al, again&s;t the Danger of <HI>Worldly
Temp|tations.</HI></P>
<P> I SHALL content my &s;elf with men|tioning a few In&s;tances,
that lately hap|pen'd, upon the Heels of one another.&mdash;Among&s;t many
<HI>Neighbours in the Country,</HI> I can boa&s;t but of one <HI>Friend,</HI>
with whom I live in the greate&s;t Intimacy.&mdash;He was one Day at Dinner
with me, and &s;aid, oc|ca&s;ionally, in a laughing way, That there might
po&s;&s;ibly be <HI>other Faults</HI> in a <HI>Wife,</HI> as in&s;upportable as
<HI>Adultery:</HI> At this, my <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s <HI>Cha&s;tity</HI> flew
out, at her Mouth, and Eyes.&mdash;<HI>The Spirit of Hone&s;ty came</HI> 
<PB N="269" REF="270"> <HI>upon her,</HI> and &s;he threw the Spoons, and
Salts, at his Head, till her <HI>Vertue remain'd Triumphant,</HI> and &s;he had
driven her An|tagoni&s;t from Table.</P>
<P> WHILE this Storm was in the Air, there cou'd be little Quiet
under its Influences; &s;o, I judiciou&s;ly retir'd to a Farm-hou&s;e; where I
had been recovering my &s;elf, about a Week, when a Me&s;&s;enger came with
Tydings, That my &s;potle&s;s Spou&s;e, having heard, as Ill-luck wou'd have
it, that the Nur&s;e to my only Child was a Ba&s;tard, had turn'd her away, at
a Mi|nute's Warning, and kill'd the Child, in Three Days after, by
per&s;i&s;ting in a Re&s;olu- to <HI>wean</HI> it, from a Milk of &s;o
<HI>wicked an Original!</HI> Upon this melancholly Account, I hurried Home,
where I had the Comfort to be convinc'd, that I ought, by no Means, to be
&s;orry, for the Death of my Child, &s;ince my Wife's <HI>Vertue</HI> was
<HI>yet alive,</HI> and her <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> pre&s;erv'd
<HI>inviolate.</HI></P>
<P> NOW, Sir, what is to be done in &s;uch a Ca&s;e?&mdash;I wou'd
tell her, if I dur&s;t; (nay, I will, if you are &s;o kind, as to <HI>&s;tand
by me), That</HI> the <HI>Vertue</HI> of a Man's <HI>Wife, will</HI> never
attone for the <HI>Lo&s;s of his Friend:</HI> And that her <HI>Cha&s;tity</HI>
is the wor&s;t Remedy, &s;he cou'd have thought on, to &s;upply the Lo&s;s of a
<HI>Son</HI> and <HI>Heir.</HI>&mdash;Nay, if &s;he &s;hou'd not believe me, I
am determin'd (if you think there may be no <HI>Danger</HI> in it) to let her
alone to try the Experiment.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="271"> SIR, I have fairly told you my Story, and
beg you will expatiate upon the Sub|ject. Pray give a little of your
&s;ea&s;onable Advice to the&s;e Profe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Grace with|out
Gracefulne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;Per&s;wade 'em, if you can, to con&s;ider, That a

may venture to &s;ay, too, That <HI>Continency,</HI> by

<HI>Vertue:</HI> And, that a Wife, who &s;ets up her <HI>Cha&s;tity,</HI> as a
<HI>Spe|cifick,</HI> to cure all Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, is more in|&s;upportable,
than a <HI>Quack,</HI> who can cure, only, the <HI>Tooth-ach,</HI> and

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> IN Return for that Plea&s;ure with which I have read your
Abridgment of <HI>PA|RUTA</HI>'s <HI>Soliloquy,</HI> in one of your late
<HI>Papers,</HI> I &s;end you an Ab&s;tract from a much more modern Treati&s;e,
Intitled, <HI>An Enquiry into the Nature of Society,</HI> wherein the Author
has con&s;ider'd <HI>Hypocri&s;ie,</HI> as it is the Effect of our Common
<HI>Self-Love,</HI> in a manner, that is equally new, and delightful; and with
a <HI>Penetration,</HI> as Remarkable as the <HI>Plea|&s;antry</HI> of his
Images.&mdash;In &s;hort, His <HI>De|&s;criptions</HI> appear to me &s;o full
of Nature, Wit, and Liveline&s;s, that I believe they cannot fail to give great
Plea&s;ure to your Readers: And, for that Rea&s;on, I have tran&s;crib'd what
follows, and &s;end it you, for their Entertainment.</P>
<Q><PB N="276" REF="277"> 
<P> THEY (&s;ays this too near Ob&s;erver) who have never taken
Notice of the Conver&s;a|tion of a <HI>Spruce Mercer,</HI> and a <HI>Young
Lady,</HI> his Cu&s;tomer, who comes to his Shop, have neglected a Scene of
Life, that is very <HI>en|tertaining.</HI>&mdash;HIS Bu&s;ine&s;s is, to &s;ell
as much Silk as he can, at a Price by which he &s;hall get what he
propo&s;es:&mdash;As to the <HI>Lady,</HI> what SHE would be at is, to plea&s;e
her Fan|cy, and buy cheaper by a Groat or Six|pence a Yard, than the Things,
&s;he wants, are commonly &s;old at.</P> 
<P> FROM the Impre&s;&s;ion, the Gallantry of our Sex has made
upon her, &s;he imagines, That &s;he has a fine <HI>Mein,</HI> and ea&s;ie
<HI>Beha|viour,</HI> and a <HI>peculiar Sweetne&s;s</HI> of
<HI>Voice:</HI>&mdash;That &s;he is <HI>hand&s;ome</HI>; and, if not
<HI>beauti|ful,</HI> at lea&s;t more <HI>agreeable,</HI> than mo&s;t young
Women &s;he knows.&mdash;As &s;he has no Preten&s;ions, to purcha&s;e Things
with <HI>le&s;s Money</HI> than other People, except tho&s;e, which are built
on her <HI>Good Qualities,</HI> &s;o &s;he &s;ets her&s;elf off, to the be&s;t
Advantage her Wit, and Di&s;cretion, will let her.&mdash;The Thoughts of
<HI>Love</HI> are here out of the Ca&s;e: So, on one Hand, &s;he has no Room
for playing the <HI>Tyrant</HI>; and giving her&s;elf <HI>angry,</HI> or
<HI>peevi&s;h</HI> Airs; And, on the other, &s;he has more Liberty of
<HI>&s;peaking kindly,</HI> and being <HI>affable,</HI> than &s;he can have, on
almo&s;t any other Occa&s;ion.&mdash;She knows, that Abundance of well-bred
People come to his Shop; and endeavours to render her&s;elf 
<PB N="277" REF="278"> as <HI>amiable,</HI> as Vertue, and the Rules of
Decency, allow of.</P> 
<P> BEFORE her Coach is yet quite &s;topp'd, &s;he is approach'd
by a <HI>Gentleman-like Man,</HI> who has every thing <HI>clean,</HI> and
<HI>fa&s;hionable,</HI> about him: And who, in low Obei&s;ance, pays her
Homage, and hands her into the Shop.&mdash;There, immediately, he &s;lips from
her; and through a Bye-Way, that remains vi&s;ible, only for half a Moment,
with great Addre&s;s, <HI>entrenches</HI> him&s;elf behind the
<HI>Coun|ter</HI>; whence, <HI>facing</HI> her, with a profound
<HI>Reverence,</HI> he begs the Favour of <HI>knowing her Commands,</HI></P> 
<P> LET her &s;ay, and di&s;like, what &s;he plea|&s;es, &s;he
can never be directly <HI>contradicted:</HI> She deals with a Man, in whom,
con&s;um|mate <HI>Patience</HI> is one of the <HI>My&s;teries</HI> of his
<HI>Trade.</HI> Whatever Trouble &s;he creates, &s;he is &s;ure to hear nothing
but the mo&s;t <HI>oblig|ing Language,</HI> and has always before her a
chearful Countenance, where <HI>Joy,</HI> and <HI>Re|&s;pect,</HI> &s;eem to be
blended with <HI>Good Humour,</HI> and altogether make up an <HI>artificial
Sere|nity,</HI> more engaging than <HI>untaught Nature</HI> is able to
produce.</P> 
<P> WHEN Two Per&s;ons are &s;o well met, the Conver&s;ation
mu&s;t be very agreeable, as well as extreamly mannerly, tho' they talk, about
Trifles. While <HI>&s;he</HI> remains ir|re&s;olute what to <HI>take, he</HI>
&s;eems to be the &s;ame, in <HI>advi&s;ing</HI> her: But, when once &s;he has
<HI>cho&s;en,</HI> he immediately becomes <HI>po&s;itive,</HI> 
<PB N="278" REF="279"> That it is the <HI>Be&s;t of the Sort.</HI> He
con|tinues to extol her Fancy; and, the oftener he looks upon it, the more he
<HI>wonders,</HI> that he &s;hou'd not, <HI>before</HI> have di&s;cover'd the
Pre-eminence of it, over any Thing he has in his Shop.&mdash;He founds her
Capacity, finds out her Blind-&s;ide; and, by Fifty little Stratagems, makes
her <HI>overvalue</HI> her own Judgment, as well as the Commodity &s;he wou'd
purcha&s;e.</P> 
<P> THE greate&s;t Advantage he has over her, lies in the mo&s;t
material Part of the Com|merce between them, the <HI>Debate</HI> about the
<HI>Price</HI>; which <HI>he</HI> knows, to a Farthing, and <HI>&s;he</HI> is
wholly ignorant of: Therefore, he no where more egregiou&s;ly impo&s;es on her
Under&s;tanding. But, tho' he has, here, the Liberty of telling what
<HI>Lies</HI> he plea&s;es, as to the <HI>Prime Co&s;t,</HI> and the Money he
has <HI>refus'd,</HI> yet he tru&s;ts not to <HI>Them only.</HI> He attacks her
<HI>Vanity,</HI> and makes her <HI>be|lieve</HI> the mo&s;t <HI>incredible</HI>
Things in the World, concerning <HI>His Weakne&s;s,</HI> and her own
<HI>Su|perior Abilities.</HI>&mdash;He had taken a Re&s;olu|tion (he &s;ays)
never to part with that Piece, under &s;uch a Price.&mdash;But &s;he has the
Power of <HI>talking</HI> him out of his Purpo&s;es. He prote&s;ts, mu&s;t
<HI>lo&s;e</HI> by her; but, &s;ince &s;he &s;eems to <HI>have a Fancy for
it,</HI> and is <HI>re&s;olv'd</HI> to give no more, rather than di&s;o|blige a
Lady he has &s;o extraordinary a Va|lue for, <HI>He will let her have
it.</HI>&mdash;Only begs, <PB N="279" REF="280"> That <HI>another Time</HI>
&s;he won't &s;tand &s;o hard with him.</P> 
<P> IN the mean Time, the Buyer, who <HI>knows, that &s;he is no
Fool;</HI> and has a <HI>volu|ble Tongue,</HI> is ea&s;ily per&s;waded, that
&s;he has a very winning Way of talking: And, thinking it &s;ufficient, for the
Sake of <HI>Good-breeding,</HI> to di&s;own a Sen&s;e of her Merit, in &s;ome
witty <HI>Repartee,</HI> &s;he &s;wallows, very contentedly, the Sub&s;tance of
every Thing he has told her: And the Up&s;hot is, That with the
<HI>Satisfaction</HI> of having <HI>&s;av'd Nine|pence a Yard,</HI> &s;he has
bought her Silk ex|actly at the &s;ame Price as any Body el&s;e might have had
it for.</P> 
<P> IT is po&s;&s;ible, that this Lady, for want of being
&s;ufficiently <HI>flatter'd,</HI> or for a Fault &s;he is pleas'd to find in
his Behaviour; or, perhaps, in the <HI>Tying</HI> of his <HI>Neckcloth</HI>;
or, for &s;ome other Di&s;like, <HI>as Sub&s;tantial,</HI> may be
<HI>lo&s;t</HI>; and her Cu&s;tom be&s;tow'd on &s;ome other of the Fraternity.
But, where many of them live in a Clu&s;ter, It is not ea&s;ily de|termin'd
which Shop to go to: And the Rea&s;ons, &s;ome of the Fair-Sex have for their
Choice are often very <HI>whim&s;ical,</HI> and and kept as a <HI>Great
Secret.</HI>&mdash;Among the Mercers, a Fair-Dealer mu&s;t keep before his own
Door; and, to draw in random Cu|&s;tomers, make u&s;e of no other Importuni|ty,
than an <HI>Ob&s;equious Air</HI>; and a <HI>Bow,</HI> to every well-dre&s;s'd
Female, that offers to look towards his Shop.</P> 
<P><PB N="280" REF="281"> BUT, I have &s;een another Method o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Inviting Cu&s;tomers,</HI> the
mo&s;t di&s;tant in the World from what I have been &s;peaking of.&mdash;I
mean, that, which is practis'd by the <HI>Water|men,</HI> on tho&s;e, whom, by
their Mien, and Garb, they know to be <HI>no Londoners.</HI>&mdash;It is
plea&s;ant to &s;ee half a Dozen of the&s;e <HI>Tritons</HI> &s;urround a Man,
whom they never &s;aw in their Lives before, and Two of them, who can get
neare&s;t, clapping Each an Arm over his Neck, hug him, as familiarly, as if he
was their Brother, newly return'd from an <HI>Ea&s;t-India Voyage:</HI> A Third
lays hold of his Hand,&mdash;Another of his Sleeve,&mdash;His Coat&mdash;the
Buttons of it&mdash;or any thing he can come at: While a Fifth, or a Sixth, who
has &s;camper'd twice round him already, without being able to get at him,
plants him&s;elf directly <HI>before</HI> the Man in <HI>Hold</HI>; and, within
Three Inches of his No&s;e, con|tradicting his Rivals with an open-mouth'd Cry,
&s;hews him a dreadful Set of large Teeth, and a Remainder of Bread and
Chee&s;e, which the Country Man's Arrival had hinder'd him from
&s;wallowing.</P> 
<P> AT <HI>all This</HI> no Offence is taken. The Pea&s;ant
thinks <HI>they are making much of him</HI>; and, therefore, far from
oppo&s;ing them, he patiently &s;uffers him&s;elf to be pu&s;h'd, or pull'd,
which way they direct.&mdash;He has not Delicacy to find Fault with their
<HI>Dirt,</HI> and <HI>Sweat</HI>; for he has been us'd to it, from his Cradle:
And it is no Di&s;turbance to <PB N="281" REF="282"> him, to hear half a Score
People, &s;ome of them at his Ear, and the farthe&s;t not Five Foot from him,
<HI>bawl out,</HI> as if he was a Hundred Yards di&s;tant.&mdash;He is
con&s;ci|cious, that he makes no le&s;s Noi&s;e, when he is merry,
<HI>Him&s;elf</HI>; and is &s;ecretly <HI>pleas'd,</HI> with their boi&s;terous
U&s;age. The hawling, and pulling him about, he con&s;trues, as a
<HI>Court&s;hip,</HI> which he can <HI>feel,</HI> and <HI>under&s;tand:</HI>
And he can't help wi&s;hing them well, for the E&s;teem they &s;eem to have for
him.</P> 
<P> HE loves to be <HI>taken notice of,</HI> and ad|mires the
<HI>Londoners</HI> for being &s;o Earne&s;t in their De&s;ires to
<HI>&s;erve</HI> him, for the Value of <HI>Threepence:</HI> Whereas, in the
Country, he mu&s;t fir&s;t tell People what he wants, and tho' he lays out
Three or Four Shillings, he has hardly a Word &s;poke to him, unle&s;s it is in
An&s;wer to the Que&s;tions he is forc'd to ask them! This <HI>Alacrity</HI> in
his Behalf, moves his Gratitude, to all the Watermen, and being unwilling to
<HI>di&s;oblige any,</HI> he knows not which of them to pitch upon&mdash;I have

<HI>DEATH,</HI> &s;tand out, <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h'd:</HI> And two of my

<P>I SHALL introduce the <HI>Lover's</HI> Letter by a Reflection,
concerning the Impo&s;&s;ibility of <HI>de&s;cribing</HI> Love, and the
Benefits, which <HI>So|ciety</HI> owes this Pa&s;&s;ion; from a Poetical

<P> EVER &s;ince you have oblig'd the World with your Paper, I have
taken a great deal of Plea&s;ure in reading it; &s;uch ju&s;t
<HI>Sentiments,</HI> and your <HI>peculiar Method</HI> of <HI>Plain

who is &s;u&s;ceptible of Tenderne&s;s and Good Na|ture.</P>
<P> AMONG the Subjects, which you have cur&s;orily touch'd on,
LOVE, that Hea|venly Pa&s;&s;ion, (notwith&s;tanding your <HI>grand
Climacteric</HI>) &s;eems to claim a con&s;iderable Share in your

concern|ing the Affair of <HI>Lucinda?</HI> With what En|ergy did you
Di&s;cour&s;e! Humanity ap|pear'd in every Word, and I believe it
im|po&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t Ardent LOVER, to &s;peak of Love, with greater
<HI>Emotion,</HI> than you did in that Beautiful PLAIN DEALER.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="286"> I HAVE for &s;ome time been <HI>in

That argued &s;till, for <HI>Love</HI>; &s;omething, &s;o natural, &s;o moving!
that it was impo&s;&s;ible for one, in my Circum|&s;tance, to with&s;tand it.
The Opinion I had already conceiv'd of my <HI>Beautiful Di|&s;turber,</HI>
heighten'd by a growing and ver|tuous Pa&s;&s;ion, made me a Thou&s;and times
delight my &s;elf with an Imagination, that my <HI>Emilia</HI> re&s;embled
<HI>Lucinda!</HI> The Love I bear this mo&s;t agreeable Woman, has &s;o deeply
rooted it &s;elf in my Heart, that nei|ther <HI>Time</HI> nor

when <HI>ab&s;ent</HI> from <HI>her,</HI> I have lo&s;t the <HI>Soul,</HI> that
<HI>animates</HI> my <HI>Life,</HI> and my <HI>Mind</HI> is as effe|ctually
<HI>Dead,</HI> as my <HI>Body</HI> will be, when <HI>I am no more,</HI> and
&s;hall have learnt the Pow|er of <HI>forgetting</HI> her.</P>
<P> MY Pa&s;&s;ion for this <HI>dear Creature</HI> has been
&s;ometime <HI>Dormant:</HI> About two Years ago, my Affairs obliged me to go
Abroad, when our Acquaintance was but little cultiva|ted; yet, an Infant
Pa&s;&s;ion, even then made me &s;olely <HI>her</HI> Admirer: Such <HI>Beauty,
Good-Nature, Wit,</HI> and lively <HI>Conver&s;ation,</HI> as are rarely to be
met with in one Per&s;on, &s;o captivated me, that I could think of nothing but
the <HI>dear Emilia.</HI>&mdash;When I <PB N="286" REF="287"> return'd Home, my
Pa&s;&s;ion encrea&s;ed daily, in&s;omuch, that at this Time I am a Stran|ger
to every Thing in the World, but <HI>Love,</HI> and <HI>Emilia!</HI> without
<HI>her,</HI> I &s;hall be the mo&s;t unhappy Man alive.&mdash;I dread the
Thoughts of <HI>her</HI> being <HI>unkind,</HI> and Hea|ven grant, they may be
groundle&s;s!&mdash;I have declar'd my Pa&s;&s;ion to <HI>her,</HI> and, if I

that of a Man, who lies, <HI>expiring</HI> his <HI>Soul,</HI> on his
Death-bed.&mdash;To &s;ee how the Spirits &s;hrink inward, and retire to the
Heart; which is beating with convul|&s;ive Angui&s;h! while the Hands and Feet,
its mo&s;t <HI>remote</HI> Dependancies, are <HI>fir&s;t incolden'd</HI> to a
<HI>fa&s;hioned</HI> Clay, as if Death <HI>crept in at the Nails,</HI> and
wou'd, by Surprize, from both <HI>Extreams,</HI> make &s;ure of the <HI>vital
Center.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Mind</HI> would fain <HI>utter</HI> it &s;elf, but the

<HI>Eyes</HI> now &s;ettle to a dim Fix|edne&s;s; <PB N="288" REF="289"> which
but a little before, was as &s;wift as the Shoots of Lightning, as nimble as
<HI>Thought,</HI> and as bright as the poli&s;h'd <HI>Dia|mond!</HI> The

Maje&s;ty,</HI> even to the Captivating of admiring Souls, is alter'd in|to
<HI>frightful Palene&s;s,</HI> and the Languor of a gha&s;tly
Stillne&s;s.&mdash;The <HI>Tongue</HI> is <HI>&s;ilent,</HI> which commanded a
Family, nay, perhaps a <HI>King|dom</HI>; and kept every Thing in Awe, with the
Importance of its Motion.&mdash;The <HI>Form</HI> that was, Ye&s;terday, &s;o
graceful, is now become a Thing &s;o full of <HI>Horror,</HI> that
<HI>Children</HI> are afraid to look upon it; and mu&s;t, therefore, be
tran&s;mitted from its Plea&s;ures, and its Pa&s;|&s;ions,&mdash;from all the
Scences of its inchant|ing Blandi&s;hments, to a dark and &s;ilent
<HI>Grave.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is even the Difference of <HI>two &s;eve|ral Worlds,</HI>
betwixt a King, <HI>enamel'd</HI> with his Robes and Jewels, &s;itting in his
Imperial <HI>State</HI>; and his Po&s;ture, Figure and Condition when
con&s;ign'd to his Six Foot of Royalty, to his <HI>Box</HI> of everla&s;ting
Ob&s;curity. And yet this <HI>Change</HI> is without any vi&s;ible,
&s;ub&s;tan|tial, <HI>Diminution:</HI> All the <HI>Limbs</HI> remain per|fect,
as they were, without Di&s;location, or Contraction.&mdash;Whence
<HI>Scaliger</HI> defines Death to be but the <HI>Ce&s;&s;ation of the Soul's
Functions:</HI> As if it were rather a <HI>Re&s;traint,</HI> than a
<HI>Di&s;&s;o|lution.</HI> What &s;eems wanting, is chiefly <HI>Colour,
Heat,</HI> and <HI>Motion</HI>; yet, that gro&s;s Object, which is left to the
Spectator's Eyes, remains <PB N="289" REF="290"> remains now but a Compound of
the two ignobler Elements, <HI>Water</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI>; while the two
purer, <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Air</HI>; are winged away, as fitter Attendants on
the <HI>Soul,</HI> than on the extingui&s;h'd <HI>Body.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN this happens to one, who&s;e Conver|&s;ation hath indeared
him to us, when we &s;ee his Eyes <HI>put on Death,</HI> and hear the
<HI>tolling Bell</HI> give publick Notice of it, what Soul can <HI>then</HI>
lo&s;e a Thought on the fugitive Joys of <HI>Plea&s;ure!</HI> What a
<HI>Bubble,</HI> what a <HI>Puff,</HI> what a <HI>Wink</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> is
Man! And with what a general, and &s;ure, Succe&s;s, does Death &s;tand over
Humane Nature, always <HI>&s;triking,</HI> here and there, and exerci&s;ing an
unbounded <HI>Triumph!</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE, lately, from &s;uch a Sight as <HI>This,</HI> learnt both
<HI>Humility</HI> and <HI>Elevation:</HI>&mdash;The One, to lower my E&s;teem
of a <HI>Body,</HI> which mu&s;t, one Day peri&s;h in unlovely
<HI>Rottenne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;The other, to Reverence a <HI>Soul,</HI> which

<P> HUMANITY has in&s;tructed me, That he who lets a <HI>Secret

to take Care of me; and he &s;ent me to the <HI>Univer&s;ity</HI>; where I have
now been (at <HI>his</HI> Charge) about two Years, and a half.&mdash;I come up
to <HI>London,</HI> every <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> to pa&s;s a Month at my

<HI>City</HI>; and give him an <HI>Account,</HI> as he calls it, what I have

him with that infallible Mark of a <HI>narrow Spi|rit,</HI>&mdash;The

coar&s;ely, in mind of his <HI>Charity,</HI> That he <HI>robb'd</HI> me, even
of the <HI>Comfort,</HI> which <HI>He laid out his Money to procure</HI>
me.</P>
<P> THIS la&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> being &s;eiz'd by a violent
Fit of the <HI>Gout</HI>; he was roaring out, one Day, in Extremity of
<HI>Pain,</HI> and <HI>Peevi&s;hne&s;s:</HI>&mdash;He cou'd not, he &s;aid,

<HI>remarkable</HI> for his <HI>Self-Denial,</HI> to fall under the Torture of
<HI>&s;uch a Di&s;ea&s;e, as the Gout!</HI>&mdash;It was very hard!&mdash;It
was very &s;trange!&mdash;And he cou'd not, <HI>for his Part,</HI> tell, how it
was to be <HI>accounted for.</HI></P>
<P> IT was my Good-Luck, at that Time, to have been newly reading a

&s;omething, that I met with, in it, which had pleas'd me very much; and made
an Impre&s;&s;ion on my Memory.&mdash;I ran, and fetch'd the Book, and opening

and told him, He might there, find the <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> of that
<HI>Misfortune,</HI> he had been complaining of.&mdash;He de&s;ir'd me to read
it to him, and I did it, as follows.</P>

Twenty Times a Day, in all Companies, as a Proof of his <HI>Nephew's

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> THE only Account I &s;hall give you, with Regard to
<HI>my&s;elf,</HI> is,&mdash;That I am a <HI>Fellow</HI> of one of the
<HI>Colleges,</HI> in this <HI>Univer&s;ity</HI>; my chief De&s;ign in Writing,
bing to &s;trengthen you, with &s;ome <HI>new Ma|terials</HI> for the better
Performance of that Promi&s;e, you were once pleas'd to make us, of
<HI>proving,</HI> that the <HI>Women</HI> are a great deal <HI>wi&s;er</HI>
than <HI>We are.</HI></P>
<P> MY Father, very lately, &s;ent me down, into the <HI>Fens,</HI>
to <HI>make Love</HI> to a young Lady, who is Mi&s;tre&s;s of a con&s;iderable
Fortune: Where I di&s;cover'd, to my no &s;mall Mortifi|cation, That All my
<HI>Learning,</HI> hitherto, has <PB N="301" REF="302"> taught me Nothing, that
de&s;erves Compa|ri&s;on, with the <HI>Univer&s;al Knowledge,</HI> which I met
with, in that di&s;creet, and profound, Family!&mdash;Not <HI>Heaven</HI>
alone, but <HI>Earth, Air, Fire, Water; Birds, Bea&s;ts, Stocks,
Stones!</HI>&mdash;Every Part of the &s;till, or moving, mute, or &s;peaking,
<HI>Creation,</HI> has contribu|ted to the <HI>Erudition</HI> of my more than
ac|compli&s;h'd Mi&s;tre&s;s!&mdash;All Things been <HI>laid open,</HI> to her,
if not in their <HI>Natures,</HI> I am &s;ure, I may &s;ay, in their
<HI>Meanings.</HI></P>
<P> IN &s;hort, after Three Days un&s;ucce&s;sful Endeavours to
fathom my Fate, with Re|gard to this <HI>infallible</HI> Lady, I am come back
to my College, almo&s;t too <HI>humble to wi&s;h for</HI> the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Ble&s;&s;ing, &s;o <HI>uncommon.</HI>&mdash;I &s;aw a
<HI>female Dwarf,</HI> in my Mi&s;tre&s;s's Neighbourhood, and could not help
think|ing, while I was looking on her, and li&s;ten|ing to a little Hi&s;tory,
of her having been <HI>&s;erv'd up in a Goo&s;e-Pye,</HI> That this Pocket
<HI>Abridgement</HI> of <HI>Womanhood</HI> might as mo|de&s;tly pretend to
incorporate Her&s;elf with one of the <HI>Gyants,</HI> in the King of
<HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI>'s <HI>frightful Regiment,</HI> as I, to <HI>match my
Mind</HI> with one, who&s;e <HI>Comprehen&s;ion</HI> is, &s;o va&s;tly, too
<HI>big</HI> for me!&mdash;</P>
<P> AT my fir&s;t coming, I was receiv'd, by an <HI>old Maiden
Aunt,</HI> who is Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Ceremonies to the Lady I was recommen|ded
to; &s;he &s;urpriz'd me with a Declara|tion, That &s;he <HI>knew of my coming,
before &s;he receiv'd my Father's Letter,</HI> I &s;aid, I 
<PB N="302" REF="303"> thought it had been a <HI>Secret:</HI> but &s;he
a&s;&s;ur'd me. That I had been <HI>hanging, for a whole Week pa&s;t, upon one
of the Bars of the Kitchen Chimney.</HI>&mdash;Not being intirely
<HI>En|lighten'd,</HI> as to the <HI>Authority</HI> of this dark Progno&s;tick,
I was preparing to ask a Que|&s;tion, or too; but was <HI>&s;car'd</HI> out of
the Intention, by a melancholy Denunciation, <HI>That my Father wou'd not live
to &s;ee the Match come to Perfection</HI>; for this Good Lady had (the Night
before this Letter was brought to her) <HI>&s;een it coming, in Both her
Candles, with a Winding-Sheet ju&s;t over-again&s;t it!</HI></P>
<P> I BOW'D, with a becoming <HI>Sorrow</HI>; and receiv'd the
Prophecy with all that <HI>Re|verence</HI> which was due to &s;o
<HI>extraordinary a Rea&s;on!</HI> This won her to a Warmth in my Intere&s;t;
and &s;he would carry me, without Ceremony, to <HI>&s;urprize</HI> her Neice,
in the Garden, where &s;he was vi&s;iting her <HI>Orange Trees,</HI> in the
<HI>Green-Hou&s;e:</HI>&mdash;We were got as forward, on this plea&s;ing
Journey, as to the out&s;ide of the Garden Door, when &s;ome or other of
tho&s;e <HI>bu&s;y Powers who envy Lovers their propos'd Enjoyments,</HI> put
it in|to the Old Lady's <HI>Feet, to &s;tumble over the Thre&s;hold!</HI> upon
which &s;he turn'd back, in a Fright, and pu&s;h'd me <HI>in</HI> again, with
&s;uch <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Kindne&s;s,</HI> that I can never &s;uffi|ciently
<HI>thank</HI> her; &s;ince, if I had <HI>gone on,</HI> (after &s;uch an
<HI>ominous Warning</HI>) <HI>and met my Mi&s;tre&s;s, in an unlucky
Minute,</HI> All the <PB N="303" REF="304"> World, it &s;eems, from that Time
forward, could never have made it po&s;&s;ible for me to <HI>come near her, in
a</HI> LUCKY <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P> SHE overtook us, however, as &s;oon as we were got back, into
the Parlor; and broke in upon me with &s;uch a <HI>Fla&s;h</HI> of
<HI>Charms,</HI> that, as I &s;aluted her, I was &s;truck dumb with
<HI>Rapture,</HI> out, of which I reco|vered in Time to over-hear her tell the
Old Lady, as &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing round her, to a Chair, <HI>That it was not
I, that had drawn open her Curtains, when the Bride-Cake was put under her
Pillow.</HI>&mdash;I was not, yet, skil|ful enough to know what <HI>Good,</HI>
or <HI>Ill,</HI> this <HI>boded</HI> me: But, before we were fully &s;eated, a
new Misfortune had befallen us.&mdash;My <HI>Clarinda</HI>'s <HI>Chair tumbled
backward,</HI> upon which &s;he declared to me, with the prettie&s;t
Re&s;ignation in the World, <HI>That &s;he was not to be</HI> LADY-MAYORESS,
<HI>this Year</HI>; but had <HI>Patience</HI> to &s;upport her&s;elf, under all
&s;uch Di&s;appointments.</P>
<P> BEING now got into perfect Compo&s;ure, I began to find, that I
was <HI>looking &s;illy,</HI>&mdash;So I &s;igh'd three Times, and inform'd
her, as well as I cou'd, of the <HI>Great Re&s;pect my Fa|ther had, for the
Family;</HI> And <HI>Clarinda,</HI> on her Part, had open'd her Fan, to its
full Extent, and was looking down upon it, in the proper <HI>Attitude</HI>; and
telling the Sticks, with both Fingers, when the Aunt inter|rupted me with a
Groan, (that had been unluckily mention'd by my naming my <PB N="304" REF="305"> <HI>Father)</HI> and confirm'd her former Remark, of the <HI>Winding
Sheet,</HI> by a <HI>Death's Head, &s;he had found out, in the
Fire!</HI>&mdash;As <HI>Great Misfortunes</HI> rarely come <HI>&s;ingle,</HI> a
malicious Coal, <HI>in the Shape of a Coffin,</HI> flew, ju&s;t then, to
<HI>Clarinda</HI>'s Feet; who turn'd pale, and took it up, betwixt a Finger,
and Thumb, and after throwing it <HI>behind</HI> her, over the <HI>left</HI>
Shoulder, corroborated her Aunt's Evidence, by a <HI>Death-Watch,</HI> that had
kept her <HI>waking</HI>;&mdash;By the <HI>howling of a Dog,</HI> all Night
long;&mdash;By a deep <HI>Grave</HI> that he had &s;cratch'd up, at the Foot of
a <HI>Ro&s;emary</HI> Bu&s;h, exactly under her Window!</P>
<P> AND, now, their Eyes being turn'd on Me, as if they expected my
Opinion; I gave it them, very gravely, <HI>That the&s;e Things had &s;omewhat
in 'm!</HI>&mdash;and it was happy for me, that I &s;aid no <HI>le&s;s</HI> for
an Old Family Servant, with a &s;ober, mournful, Face, having heard Part of the
Di&s;cour&s;e, while he was bu&s;y about the Fire, very di&s;mally confirm'd
our Terrors, by Three Proofs, which were &s;tronger than all.&mdash;Fir&s;t, by
the <HI>&s;queaking of a Wea&s;el,</HI> that had met him upon the
<HI>Cellar-Stairs</HI>; Secondly, by a <HI>Hole, that the Rats had gnaw'd, in
the Back of his be&s;t Livery:</HI> And, Thirdly, by a &s;trange
<HI>Dream,</HI> that Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> the Cham|ber-maid, had been
almo&s;t frighted out of her <HI>Wits</HI> by, about <HI>Wet
Cloaths,&mdash;Three Mini&s;ters,&mdash;Ripe Fruit,&mdash;and Ro&s;es in
Blo&s;&s;om!</HI>&mdash;After all which, to put it ab&s;o|lutely 
<PB N="305" REF="306"> out of Doubt, and <HI>convince</HI> us, <HI>That
&s;omebody wou'd die &s;hortly,</HI> he &s;hew'd us on one of his Hands, a
dirty <HI>yellow Spot,</HI> which the Thumb, of his other (as he &s;hook his
Head, and ob&s;erv'd to us) was not <HI>broad</HI> enough to <HI>cover</HI>;
and this, they all agreed, was no better than a <HI>Death-Mould,</HI> and
<HI>mu&s;t mean &s;omething.</HI></P>
<P> IN the mid&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Mi&s;eries,</HI> I had very
little to &s;ay for my &s;elf, having been <HI>put out</HI> of a premeditated
<HI>Speech,</HI> which I had been inventing during my whole Jour|ney; but as
<HI>Good-Luck</HI> wou'd have it, the <HI>Tea</HI> came in, to my Relief; and
the fir&s;t <HI>Di&s;h,</HI> that had the Ble&s;&s;ing to approach
<HI>Clarinda</HI>'s Lips, was &s;o richly cover'd with <HI>Money-bags,</HI>
floating in white Circles, all over the Surface, that <HI>Gayety</HI> took
Place of <HI>Melancholy.</HI>&mdash;A little <HI>Spider</HI> too, was &s;o kind
as to <HI>&s;pin down Good-Luck, into her Lap,</HI> (which, methought, meant
<HI>me</HI> no Harm) Nay, I became, on a &s;udden, &s;o happy, that her
<HI>Elbow</HI> declar'd in my Fa|vour; and her Aunt put her to the
<HI>Blu&s;h,</HI> by ob&s;erving, <HI>&s;he mu&s;t change her
Bedfellow.</HI></P>
<P> BUT let no Man be too much in <HI>Ha&s;te,</HI> to conclude,
that He is <HI>happy.</HI>&mdash;My Tri|umph was <HI>da&s;h'd at once,</HI> by
a Di&s;covery That <HI>this was Childermas-Day:</HI> After which my
Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;aid no more, but that <HI>Nothing wou'd come to Good, that was
begun on that wor&s;t Day of the Week:</HI> So her Teeth ach'd <HI>mo&s;t
prodigiou&s;ly?</HI> She was &s;orry &s;he cou'd be <PB N="306" REF="307">
<HI>no Company</HI>; and took her Leave of us, till next Morning.</P>
<P> NEXT Morning came;&mdash;and the fir&s;t Per&s;on I met, was
Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an</HI>; whom I di&s;|cover'd, cro&s;s the Hall, &s;pitting
&s;eriou&s;ly in her Hand, and &s;hutting it clo&s;e, with a great deal of
Caution, for Fear of <HI>letting &s;lip</HI> (as &s;he afterwards told me) a
<HI>Sign,</HI> &s;he had felt, in her Palm, that a <HI>hand&s;ome Gift</HI> was
very near her.&mdash;I was glad of this favourable Opportunity, to confirm the
<HI>Truth of that Token</HI>; and &s;he was &s;o oblig|ingly
<HI>Communicative</HI> as to intru&s;t me with two great Secrets, <HI>One,</HI>
That, <HI>I had trod upon her Lady's Toe,</HI> la&s;t Night, in the Hurry of
waiting on her to the Stair-foot; whence a Conclu&s;ion had been drawn, in my
Fa|vour, <HI>That I &s;hou'd come, e'er long, to her Bed&s;ide.</HI>&mdash;The
<HI>other,</HI> that Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an</HI> ha|ving di&s;cover'd, this very
Morning, That one of her Lady's <HI>Stockings</HI> had been <HI>put on,
wrong&s;ide outward,</HI> was forbid pulling it off again, for Fear of
<HI>turning &s;ome Good-Luck, that was meant her.</HI></P>
<P> Mrs. <HI>SUSAN,</HI> in Return for her kind Intelligence, was
very Earne&s;t to know, whether I had <HI>dreamt of no Body?</HI>&mdash;I told
her, I had had the Happine&s;s to be, all Night, in <HI>Her Lady's
Company:</HI> And I cou'd perceive, that this Information was no more than had
been expected; which led me into &s;ome probable Gue&s;&s;es, con|cerning the
Purpo&s;e of a <HI>Ca&s;e-Knife, in a</HI> <PB N="307" REF="308">
<HI>Common-Prayer-Book,</HI> which, when I got up, in the Morning, I had found,
<HI>under my Bol&s;ter.</HI>&mdash;While, I held this Conference with my
<HI>Fellow-Servant,</HI> we had the Plea|&s;ure of bidding our <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s
Goodmorrow,</HI> and of hearing (to my no &s;mall Comfort) That her
<HI>Foot,</HI> as &s;he came down Stairs, had given her the Signal, <HI>That
&s;he was to tread upon &s;trange Ground.</HI></P>
<P> IN fine, Sir, it is impo&s;&s;ible for you to conceive what an
infinite Variety of <HI>Notices, Impul&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Progno&s;ticks,</HI>
outward, and inward, the&s;e Ladies direct their Conduct by.&mdash;In my Three
Days &s;tay, (which I thought enough for my fir&s;t Vi&s;it) I cou'd learn
nothing, with any certainty, of what I chiefly &s;ought to know; but was
edified, above Mea&s;ure, in the <HI>Occult Sciences of the
Family.</HI>&mdash;My Mi&s;tre&s;s call'd after me, when I had taken Hor&s;e to
come away, that &s;he was afraid I &s;hou'd have a <HI>wet Jour|ney</HI>; for
<HI>Pu&s;s was wa&s;hing her Face,</HI> and carried her <HI>Paw above her
Ears;</HI> which, &s;he a&s;&s;ur'd me, was a <HI>Sign,</HI> that had never
been known to mi&s;carry.&mdash;Whether &s;he meant this as a Di&s;play of her
<HI>Art,</HI> or of her <HI>In|clination to bring me back again,</HI> is a
My&s;te|ry; which, notwith&s;tanding the great Ad|vance I have made in
<HI>gue&s;&s;ing,</HI> I am, yet, unable to di&s;clo&s;e, with any po&s;itive
De|pendance.</P>
<P> BUT, I wou'd not, (for all that) have you think &s;lightly of
my <HI>Skill in Tokens</HI>; <PB N="308" REF="309"> &s;ince I cou'd
<HI>a&s;toni&s;h</HI> you, if I thought fit, with a Profu&s;ion of
<HI>portentous My&s;teries.</HI>&mdash;I am ab&s;olutely Ma&s;ter of that

can foretell the mo&s;t agreeable Things in the World, by <HI>Six Pea-&s;hells
over a Door:</HI> And anticipate Con&s;equences, which wou'd puzzle a
<HI>South&s;ayer,</HI> by <HI>turning Three Times round, in my Shirt, and

Help of a <HI>Grey Goo&s;e Wing,</HI> a <HI>Clean Hearth,</HI> and a <HI>Seive
full of A&s;hes!</HI></P>
<P> BUT I &s;hou'd never have done, were I I to let you into the
Virtues of <HI>Ro&s;es ga|ther'd on Mid&s;ummer Night</HI>&mdash;of

<P>WE had once a Species of <HI>Opera,</HI> call'd <HI>Dramatic,</HI>
in which the Dignity of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> was not &s;acrific'd, as it is now,
to the Di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of <HI>Sound</HI>; but the Force of <HI>Words</HI>

<HI>Decoration,</HI> and impre&s;s'd upon the Soul, by the Mediation of the
<HI>Sen&s;es.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="311">I HAVE heard, with a Plea&s;ure, which, I
hope, was not groundle&s;s, That there is a De&s;ign on foot, in one of our
<HI>Theatres,</HI> to re&s;tore the&s;e manly, as well as delightful,
Entertainments, with an Elegance, and Mag|nificence of Ornament, which we have
not yet been accu&s;tom'd to.&mdash;The Succe&s;s, which <HI>Diocle&s;ian</HI>
has met with (an <HI>Opera,</HI> of <HI>this Kind,</HI> but far &s;hort of the
Perfection, which I am told it is propos'd to rai&s;e to them to) will &s;erve,
it is to be hop'd, as an Encourage|ment, to keep the Gentleman, who is
<HI>Pa|tentee</HI> of that <HI>Theatre, firm</HI> and <HI>vigorous,</HI> in his
Intention.&mdash;His Genius is admirably turn'd to tho&s;e Embelli&s;hments of
<HI>Show</HI> and <HI>Scenary,</HI> which will always have a &s;urprizing, and
powerful Effect, on the <HI>Stage</HI>; but <HI>mo&s;t</HI> where they are
aptly, and &s;ignificantly, in|troduced:&mdash;And, there are not wanting
<HI>Writers,</HI> who can contribute <HI>Subject,</HI> and
<HI>Oc|ca&s;ion,</HI> whereon to exhau&s;t, in the mo&s;t rational, as well as
agreeable Manner, the &s;prightly Copiou&s;ne&s;s of his Invention. So that I
am almo&s;t led to flatter my &s;elf, That our ema&s;|culating pre&s;ent
Ta&s;te, of the <HI>Italian</HI> Luxu|ry, and <HI>Wantonne&s;s</HI> of
<HI>Mu&s;ick,</HI> will give way to a more <HI>Pa&s;&s;ionate,</HI> and

<HI>Ear</HI> may expect to be <HI>charm'd,</HI> but the <HI>Heart</HI> to be
touch'd and tran&s;ported.</P>
<P>IT will be receiv'd as the Effect of <HI>Spleen,</HI> or
<HI>Affectation,</HI> to in&s;inuate, That the Martial Spirit of our Nation, is
effeminated, and gra|dually <PB N="311" REF="312"> relax'd, by the Influence of
this &s;of|tening <HI>Syren:</HI> And yet <HI>Cicero</HI> (who was at lea&s;t
as good a Judge as mo&s;t of the Mem|bers of our <HI>ROYAL ACADEMY for
En|couragement of TRIFLING)</HI> has not &s;cru|pled to &s;ay plainly, (in his
Tract <HI>de Legibus)</HI>&mdash;That <HI>the Good or Evil, in a State, depends
greatly on the MUSICK, that is mo&s;t en|courag'd in it: For, if it be too
Light, and Wanton, the People are in&s;en&s;ibly render'd fooli&s;h, and
di&s;orderly; and, on the contrary, if it be Grave and Ma&s;culine, they become
mode&s;t, by its Influence.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Spartan</HI> Plainne&s;s and Au&s;terity, have been
celebrated in every Age: And Hi&s;tories are full of In&s;tances of that Wi&s;e
People's Ri|gour, again&s;t <HI>Innovation,</HI> in Particulars which &s;eem'd
to threaten them (at what Di&s;tance &s;oever) with the modi&s;h Luxuries of
their Neighbours: But the &s;tronge&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion which was ever made upon
me in their Fa|vour, was from the Decree they pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t
<HI>Timotheus,</HI> the <HI>Mile&s;ian,</HI> for an <HI>Improvement</HI> he had
introduced in <HI>Mu&s;ick,</HI> much like the admir'd <HI>Concerto's</HI> of
our <HI>Italian Benefactors.</HI> But the&s;e Grave <HI>Men of

<HI>Lylius Gyraldus</HI> has in&s;erted, as he tran&s;crib'd it, from
<HI>Boetius.</HI></P>
<Q>FORASMUCH as <HI>Timotheus,</HI> the <HI>Mile&s;ian,</HI>
(receiv'd into our City) holding <PB N="312" REF="313"> in Contempt the ancient
<HI>Mu&s;ick,</HI> and re|jecting the <HI>Harp with Seven Strings,</HI> hath
introduced an <HI>Harmony of many Voices,</HI> cor|rupting the Ears of our
Youth, by a Mul|tiplicity of Strings, and a Mu&s;ick hitherto unknown,
<HI>Dividing the Simple Notes,</HI> into a Variety of <HI>Feints</HI> and
<HI>Quaverings,</HI> We do therefore Ordain, That he &s;hall be
<HI>impeach'd,</HI> and that his &s;uperfluous Strings <HI>&s;hall be
broken:</HI> To the End, that <HI>Strangers,</HI> from <HI>his Example,</HI>
may be wary of bringing among <HI>Spartans,</HI> the light, and unmanly,
Amu&s;ements, which are practis'd, in <HI>le&s;s mode&s;t Countries.</HI></Q>
<P>WHEN I reflect on the Power of Mu&s;ick, as it was practis'd among
the Ancients, and con&s;ider the miraculous In&s;tances of its Ef|fects, on the
Pa&s;&s;ions of &s;ome Princes, who were mo&s;t inflexible in their
Re&s;olutions: And, when, at the &s;ame Time, I con&s;ider, That the Mu&s;ick,
which had this prodigious Influence, was the Rever&s;e (as I &s;hall
pre|&s;ently prove) of That, which now prevails in <HI>Europe,</HI> and which
produces none of tho&s;e <HI>tran&s;porting Effects,</HI> What le&s;s can I
con|clude, than that All our boa&s;ted Additions to this heavenly Art, are
rather <HI>Enlargements</HI> than <HI>Improvements:</HI>&mdash;There is a
little Piece, of <HI>Randolph</HI>'s; which, of all his Poems, I am mo&s;t
pleas'd with; and which gives us, as it were in <HI>Miniature,</HI> the whole,
that can be &s;aid, of Mu&s;ick!</P>
<Q><PB N="313" REF="314"> 
<L>Mu&s;ick! Thou Queen of Souls;&mdash;Ari&s;e, and &s;tring</L> 
<L>Thy powerful Lute; and &s;ome &s;ad <HI>Requiem</HI> &s;ing:</L>

<L>'Till <HI>Rocks re murmur</HI> an awaken'd <HI>Groan,</HI></L> 
<L>And <HI>li&s;t'ning Tempe&s;ts</HI> catch the mournful Tone!</L>

<L>Then, on a &s;udden, with excur&s;ive Hand,</L> 
<L><HI>Fly</HI> o'er the <HI>&s;ounding Chords,</HI> with
<HI>Light</HI> command:</L> 
<L>'Till <HI>Oaks,</HI> and &s;truggling <HI>Elms,</HI> uprooted,

<L>Strike a <HI>&s;ad Note,</HI>&mdash;and fix 'em <HI>Trees</HI>
again.</L></Q>
<P>I SAID, above, That the &s;trange Effects, reported of
<HI>Mu&s;ick in former Times,</HI> were the Influence of a Practice, very
different from the <HI>modern</HI>; and I cannot more effectually &s;trengthen
that A&s;&s;ertion, than by ob&s;erving I am confirm'd in it, by the Opinion of
Dr. <HI>Wallis,</HI> communicated, on this Subject, to the <HI>Royal
Society.</HI></P>
<P>THE Mu&s;ick of the Antients was more <HI>ex|ten&s;ive</HI> than
ours: For <HI>Poetry</HI> and <HI>Dancing</HI> (or mea&s;ur'd Motion) were then
accounted Parts of <HI>Mu&s;ick.</HI>&mdash;Now, we know, that
<HI>Ver&s;e,</HI> if harmonious, and pa&s;&s;ionate, <HI>&s;et</HI> to a
<HI>plain Tune,</HI> and &s;ung by a <HI>natural Voice,</HI> with &s;ome
<HI>&s;oft In&s;trumental Mu&s;ick,</HI> &s;uch as not drowns, or ob&s;cures,
but heightens the <HI>Emphatick</HI> Expre&s;&s;ions; will work &s;trangely
upon the Ear, and move all our Pa&s;&s;ions, in Proporti|on to the
<HI>Tune</HI> and <HI>Subject</HI>; but e&s;pecially, if attended with
&s;uitable <HI>Ge&s;ture</HI> and <HI>Action.</HI> For, 'tis evident, on the
<HI>Stage,</HI> that proper <PB N="314" REF="315"> <HI>Acting</HI> gives great
<HI>Life</HI> to Words. Now, all this <HI>together,</HI> (which made up the
Ancient <HI>Mu&s;ick)</HI> mu&s;t needs operate &s;trongly on the Fancy and
Affections.&mdash;For, if the delibe|rate Reading of a Romance (if it happens
to be well penn'd) will produce <HI>Mirth, Tears, Pity, Anger,
Indignation,</HI> according to the re&s;pective Intents of it, much more wou'd
it do &s;o, if accompined with all tho&s;e power|ful A&s;&s;i&s;tants.</P>
<P>WHY may not all This be <HI>now</HI> done, as well as
<HI>then?</HI>&mdash;No Doubt it <HI>may,</HI> and with equal <HI>Effect</HI>
too, if the <HI>Words</HI> were but elegantly adapted to the <HI>Argument,</HI>
and di&s;pos'd in Places, proper for their <HI>Empha&s;is,</HI> pronounc'd with
a tuneful <HI>Voice,</HI> and inlivened by ex|pre&s;&s;ive <HI>Ge&s;ture,</HI>
painting naturally the Pa&s;|&s;ion, or Condition, of the Mind; and
<HI>gra|phically delineating,</HI> as it were, to the <HI>Eye</HI> (as well as
addre&s;&s;ing to the <HI>Ear</HI>) the Bounds, Di&s;tinctions, and peculiar
Attributes, of <HI>Joy, Grief, Wonder, Fury, Jealou&s;y, Compa&s;&s;ion, Fear,
Love, Hatred,</HI> and the re&s;t of tho&s;e Emotions, which the acted Mind is
&s;ubject to.&mdash;This wou'd, as certainly <HI>now,</HI> as <HI>then,</HI>
produce extraordinary Effects; and e&s;pecially upon a <HI>Surprize,</HI> where
Per&s;ons are not preju|dic'd, or pre-engag'd; and, &s;o lie open to the meant
Impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>OUR modern <HI>Mu&s;ick</HI> is no more than what the Ancients
call'd <HI>Harmonick,</HI> which was but one Part of <HI>Theirs,</HI> who&s;e
<HI>Mu&s;ick,</HI> as I &s;aid above, con&s;i&s;ted of <HI>Words, Ver&s;e,
Voice,</HI> <PB N="315" REF="316"> <HI>Tune, In&s;trument,</HI> and
<HI>Action.</HI>&mdash;A very pow|erful Combination!&mdash;And can we expect,
from <HI>One Piece,</HI> the &s;ame Influence, as from the
<HI>Whole?</HI>&mdash;The De&s;ign of <HI>Mu&s;ick,</HI> among <HI>Us,</HI>
&s;eems to aim at exciting no <HI>particular Pa&s;&s;ion</HI>; but, in general,
to <HI>plea&s;e the Ear</HI>; and, by a tuneful Intermixture of <HI>different
Voices</HI> and <HI>Parts,</HI> with <HI>Cadencies</HI> and <HI>Con|cords,</HI>
produce an <HI>elegant Sound,</HI> which only tho&s;e Per&s;ons can di&s;cern,
who have di&s;tin|gui&s;hing <HI>Judgment</HI> in <HI>Mu&s;ick</HI>; while That
much larger Part of the Audience, which con&s;i&s;ts of Tho&s;e who have a
<HI>rude,</HI> and un|cultivated <HI>Ear,</HI> remains only amus'd, and
confounded, with a <HI>great Noi&s;e,</HI> which has Nothing
di&s;tingui&s;hable to their Capacity.</P>
<P>'TIS true, indeed, that even this <HI>Compound Mu&s;ick</HI>
admits of <HI>Characters,</HI> very different: Some are <HI>brisk, elate</HI>
and <HI>airy</HI>; &s;ome <HI>&s;edate</HI> and <HI>grave</HI>; others
<HI>&s;oft, re&s;ign'd</HI> and <HI>languid:</HI>&mdash;But, &s;till, That kind
of Harmony which is mo&s;t powerful to excite particular Pa&s;&s;ions, or
Di&s;po&s;itions, in the Mind, is the <HI>&s;imple, natural,</HI> and
<HI>uncompounded.</HI>&mdash;How often have I been forced to go abroad when I
had no mind to it, or <HI>fall a&s;leep,</HI> in the middle of the Day, by a
<HI>Nur&s;e's languid Tune,</HI> lulling her Babe to re&s;t, in a Room, within
my hearing!&mdash;Nay, continual Reading in an <HI>even Tone,</HI>&mdash;the
&s;oft Murmur of a pebbly Brook,&mdash;the falling of Rain upon
Trees,&mdash;&s;hall have an irre&s;i&s;table Power to induce a Repo&s;e upon
the Spirits.&mdash;And, on the contrary, an <PB N="316" REF="317">
<HI>derman</HI> who is lame of the <HI>Gout,</HI> &s;hall feel him&s;elf grow
light, and wanton, at the brisk|ne&s;s of a <HI>Jig,</HI> on a <HI>Kit,</HI> or
<HI>Violin,</HI> exciting a Di&s;po&s;ition to <HI>dance,</HI> that is almo&s;t
too hard for his <HI>Pain</HI> and <HI>Gravity.</HI>&mdash;Nothing is plain|er,
therefore, than that <HI>&s;imple Harmony</HI> is more operative on the
<HI>Affections,</HI> than an ela|borate <HI>Compo&s;ition</HI> of <HI>Full
Mu&s;ick.</HI></P>
<P>SO that, if it is the Aim of <HI>Mu&s;ick</HI> to <HI>plea&s;e the
Ear,</HI> the Compo&s;itions of <HI>Italian</HI> Ma&s;ters may de&s;erve to be
<HI>preferr'd,</HI> as form|ing <HI>&s;weeter Con&s;orts</HI> than were known
to the Ancients; among whom I find no Foot&s;teps of what we call <HI>&s;everal
Parts</HI> or <HI>Voices</HI> (&s;uch as <HI>Ba&s;e, Treble, Mean,</HI> &amp;c.
&s;ung in Con&s;ort) <HI>an&s;wering</HI> each other, to diver&s;ify, and fill
up, the Mu&s;ick.&mdash;But, if we mean, by <HI>Mu&s;ick,</HI> to excite
Pa&s;&s;ion, and, move the Heart, to any moral, or &s;olid Purpo&s;e, we mu&s;t
apply a more touching <HI>Simplicity,</HI> and endeavour to act <HI>upon
Nature,</HI> in a more <HI>natural,</HI> and unaf|fected Manner. And This, I
doubt not, a judicious <HI>Compo&s;er</HI> may &s;o happily effect, that
(allowing for tho&s;e <HI>Hyperboles,</HI> with which the Antient Writers &s;et
off their Mu&s;ick) our Modern may be found capable of producing as
extraordinary Effects as theirs.&mdash;And, <HI>This,</HI> methinks, is a
<HI>Mine</HI> of <HI>Plea&s;ure, yet un|open'd,</HI> and may de&s;erve to be
thought on, with &s;ome Attention, by Tho&s;e, who&s;e <HI>Pro|fit</HI> wou'd

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> THERE is a di&s;honourable Kind of Practice, among the Men, who
&s;tyle them&s;elves the <HI>Wits,</HI> which I can no longer forbear
complaining again&s;t, as an Abu&s;e that de&s;erves the Notice, and
Correction, of a PLAIN DEALER.&mdash;You mu&s;t needs have ob&s;erv'd, that our
<HI>Poets</HI> are, like our <HI>Politicians,</HI> divided into oppo&s;ite
<HI>Parties</HI>; and draw their Pens, with great Sharpne&s;s, to the Defiance
of each other's <HI>Mu&s;es.</HI>&mdash;Among the&s;e Warriors, (on both Sides)
there are a turbulent Sett of People, not <HI>Soldiers,</HI> but
<HI>Engineers,</HI> who are known by the Name of <HI>Cannon-Turners:</HI> They
never <PB N="318" REF="319"> trouble them&s;elves to provide <HI>Wit, of their
own,</HI> but are &s;ure, by &s;ome Stratagem, to &s;teal <HI>That, of their
Enemies;</HI> and apply it to a Purpo&s;e, the Rever&s;e of what it was
intended for.&mdash;The only Difficulty, they are at, is to &s;ub&s;titute the
Word TORY, in the Place of the Mono&s;yllable, WHIG, without Detriment to the
<HI>Mea&s;ure</HI> of the <HI>Ver&s;e</HI>; or to crowd the unpliable
Stubborn|ne&s;s of PRESBYTERIAN, into the pa&s;&s;ive Com|pa&s;s of JACOBITE:
For, when the&s;e little Difficulties are once happily adju&s;ted, they have
turn'd the Malice of their Adver&s;ary's Meaning directly <HI>again&s;t
Them&s;elves;</HI> and by killing, with this <HI>good Husbandry,</HI> &s;ave
the Expence of Artillery.</P>
<P> BUT it were well, Mr. PLAIN DEALER, if the&s;e
<HI>Cannon-Turners</HI> wou'd confine the Exerci&s;e of their invertive Talents
to our private, and <HI>Dome&s;tick,</HI> Factions;&mdash;On the contrary, They
are never &s;o active, as when we are at <HI>War</HI> with any of our
Neigh|bours. The <HI>French,</HI> in particular, have been very great Sufferers
by them; and have complained, That the&s;e <HI>Cannon-Tur|ners</HI> are the
only <HI>unfair Fighters,</HI> that this Nation ever &s;ent again&s;t them.</P>
<P> I SHALL better clear to your Apprehen|&s;ion, what Ju&s;tice
there may be in their Complaint, by producing one Example, of many, where the
Wit, of their own <HI>Ma|gazines,</HI> has been <HI>purloin'd,</HI> in a mo&s;t
un|&s;oldierly Manner, <HI>and di&s;charg'd upon them,</HI> to their no &s;mall
Damage.</P>

That no Subject cou'd be more &s;ea&s;onable, or &s;tand more in need of a
PLAIN DEALER. The Letter, in its Original, was directed to a

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I SHAL now according to my Promi&s;e, which I made you on the
Seventh of this In&s;tant, and which I hope came to your Hands, give you &s;ome
Account of the &s;trange Ravage which is made by <HI>Exce&s;&s;ive
Drinking,</HI> in the Bodies and Minds, and Af|fairs of tho&s;e who are
addicted to that <HI>Barba|rous Vice.</HI></P>
<P> NATURE has contriv'd it &s;o, That all her Children, as long as
they retain their <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> are fond of <HI>Life,</HI> and at the
&s;ame Time, they all believe that Life it &s;elf of which they are &s;o fond,
is a <HI>grievous Bur|then,</HI> without the Benefit of <HI>Health</HI>; but
tho' all Men are &s;atisfied of the un&s;peak|able <HI>Value</HI> of
<HI>Health,</HI> yet few are frugal Managers of it: But the <HI>Drinking</HI>
Part of Mankind are as Prodigal of it, as the <HI>Squan|derer</HI> is of
<HI>Money:</HI> For no Vice whatever does &s;o much Harm to the Body, or lays
the Foundation of &s;o many Di&s;ea&s;es, as Exce&s;&s;ive Drinking, <HI>Gout,
Stone, Cholick, Fevers, Con&s;umptions, Vapours, A&s;thma's,</HI> with a long
<HI>et caetera.</HI></P>
<P> A CERTAIN Friend of Ours, whom we love very well, has drunk
him&s;elf into no le&s;s than <HI>Three</HI> of them, <HI>viz. Gout,
A&s;thma,</HI> and <HI>Vapours</HI>; and yet he goes on in his old Cour&s;e, as
if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Juice of the <HI>Grape,</HI>

it infus'd; but here I <PB N="327" REF="328"> think my &s;elf oblig'd to
declare, that I mean, by <HI>exce&s;&s;ive Drinking,</HI> a con&s;tant, daily,
or frequent Drinking, to a greater Quantity than is &s;ufficient to cheri&s;h
Nature.</P>
<P> ALL the re&s;t of the Vices together, are not &s;o often
puni&s;h'd by &s;udden Death as exce&s;&s;ive Drinking alone is, which
&s;ome|times happens by the Malignity of the Vice it &s;elf, oppre&s;&s;ing and
&s;tifling Nature, and &s;ometimes by the fatal Accidents which attend upon it
as fal&s;e Quarrels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P> OUR Friend whom I mention'd above, has no le&s;s than
<HI>Twice,</HI> to my Knowledge, very narrowly e&s;cap'd <HI>&s;udden
Death,</HI> which had like to have happen'd <HI>both Times,</HI> by
Exce&s;&s;ive Drinking, once formerly in <HI>Lin|colns-Inn-Fields,</HI> and
another Time lately at <HI>S&mdash;</HI> Now, as a Death that gives no Time for
Repentance, ought to be look'd upon as the greate&s;t of all Puni&s;hments,
Exce&s;&s;ive Drinking, ought to be regarded as the greate&s;t of all Vices,
becau&s;e we ought to believe, That Divine Ju&s;tice has propor|tion'd
<HI>Puni&s;hments</HI> to the <HI>Crimes</HI> for which they are inflicted; and
becau&s;e there is no Vice, by which he who u&s;es it, &s;o imme|diately
Defaces or &s;o totally De&s;troys, in him&s;elf, the <HI>Image of God,</HI>
which is <HI>Rea|&s;on,</HI> I hope that upon reading this, you will have the
Goodne&s;s to admoni&s;h our Friend, who has &s;o narrowly e&s;cap'd
<HI>twice,</HI> to beware of a <HI>third Time.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="329"> AS the State of the Mind depends upon
that of the Body, and the Motions of that Particle of Heavenly Fire, upon the
Motions of the animal Spirits, which in time of <HI>Health,</HI> move
Vigorou&s;ly, and Regularly; and Weakly, and Irregularly, in time of
<HI>Sick|ne&s;s</HI>; it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, that <HI>That</HI> Vice
which is the Occa&s;ion of mo&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es in the Body, mu&s;t be
likewi&s;e the Cau&s;e of mo&s;t Di&s;orders in the Mind. And there is no Vice
that is &s;o great an Enemy to the <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> as exce&s;&s;ive
Drinking, or that &s;o often entirely <HI>Overturns</HI> it. Indeed, Drinking
to Exce&s;s while the Fit continues, &s;ometimes &s;trengthens the
<HI>Imagination</HI>; but, by the &s;ame Degrees by which it <HI>rai&s;es</HI>
the Imagination, it <HI>Depre&s;&s;es</HI> the Judgment, the former of which is
common to us with <HI>Bea&s;ts,</HI> and the latter with <HI>God</HI> and
<HI>Angels.</HI> But then the Day <HI>after</HI> Drinking, the very Imagination
langui&s;hes with the Judgment. And Drinking to Exce&s;s never fails, <HI>in
time,</HI> to <HI>Quench</HI> the Imagination, to <HI>impair</HI> the Memory,
and to drown the Judgment.</P>
<P> I DESIRE that you would admoni&s;h one of our Friend's
<HI>Capacity</HI> to take Notice, That <HI>Bacchus</HI> is often a great
<HI>Leveller,</HI> that he levels the Under&s;tandings of <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> Men
and <HI>Fools,</HI> of the Blockhead, and the Man of Sen&s;e; and that
therefore, as 'tis the In|tere&s;t of Fools to carry on this Vice, 'tis the
Intere&s;t of Men of Sen&s;e to avoid it.</P>
<P> I DESIRE that you would likewi&s;e put Him in mind that the
&s;ame <HI>Drunken Deity</HI> <PB N="329" REF="330"> is often <HI>wor&s;e</HI>
than <HI>a Leveller</HI>; that he is often a <HI>Subverter</HI> of the Order of
Things, and pulls down the <HI>Rich,</HI> and exalts the <HI>Poor</HI>; that
is, he gives Under&s;tanding to <HI>Fools,</HI> and makes Men of Sen&s;e
<HI>Madmen.</HI> For Fools having generally &s;tronger Nerves and le&s;s
volatile Spirits, than Men of great Under&s;tandings, or of Beautiful
Imaginati|ons, the &s;ame Quantity of Spiritous Liquor that will &s;et Fire to
the Phlegm of Fools and by that Means <HI>rou&s;e their Capacities,</HI> will
make Men of Sen&s;e either <HI>&s;tupid</HI> or <HI>frantick.</HI></P>
<P> AS there is no Vice, which more impairs the Under&s;tanding and
weakens the Rea&s;on, there is none which more inflames the Pa&s;|&s;ions, and
di&s;orders the <HI>Will.</HI> Several other Vices are <HI>Solitary,</HI> and
each of them &s;huns the Company of the re&s;t; but exce&s;&s;ive Drinking is
attended with the very wor&s;t of them, that is, with tho&s;e which have the
directe&s;t Tendency to the Mi&s;ery and De|&s;truction of Men; as <HI>Gaming,
Quarrels, Riots, Murders,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P> MOST <HI>other Vices</HI> are <HI>compatible</HI> with
&s;everal <HI>Virtues,</HI> but Drunkenne&s;s runs Coun|ter to all the Duties
of Life: A great Drinker, is, for the mo&s;t part, neither a good
<HI>Husband,</HI> nor a good <HI>Father,</HI> nor a good <HI>Son,</HI> nor a
good <HI>Brother,</HI> nor a good <HI>Friend.</HI></P>
<P> BUT 'tis not <HI>Virtue</HI> only that <HI>Dete&s;ts
Drunkenne&s;s;</HI> 'tis often abhorr'd even by <HI>Vice</HI> it &s;elf, as by
<HI>Avarice, Hypocri&s;ie, Am|bition,</HI> <PB N="330" REF="331">
<HI>Bigottry</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;t.</HI> As this unnatural Sin of Drinking is
attended with &s;everal that bring Mi&s;ery and De&s;truction on tho&s;e who
u&s;e them, as has been &s;aid above; 'tis often &s;hunn'd by that Human,
<HI>Natural Vice,</HI> which tends to the Propagation of Mankind, as much as it
is by <HI>Vertue.</HI> For there is nothing &s;o Incon&s;i&s;tent or
Incompati|ble with exce&s;&s;ive Drinking, as the Cleanne&s;s, Elegance, and
Delicacy, of a <HI>Courtly Gallantry.</HI></P>
<P> AS the Right Management of Human Affairs, requires Health of
Body, and Vi|gour, and Serenity of Mind, we ought not to wonder, if a Vice that
breaks the Re&s;t in him, impairs the Under&s;tanding, de|&s;troys the Memory,
inflames the Pa&s;&s;ions, and debauches the Will, entirely unquali|fies a Man
for doing what the World calls <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> And therefore hard
Drinking has ruin'd more <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Families, than all the re&s;t of
our Vices, put together; not by the immediate Expence which attends upon the
Vice, but by altering the very <HI>Natures</HI> of the Heads of Families who
u&s;e it, and mak|ing them unfit for the Management of their Affairs, of which
they were very capable be|fore: For other Vices, indeed make Men
<HI>wor&s;e,</HI> but a Habitude of exce&s;&s;ive Drinking often alters Men, to
that Degree, That they become the <HI>very Rever&s;e</HI> of what they were
before, and differ more from their <HI>former Selves,</HI> than from their
<HI>pre&s;ent Companions.</HI> Such a Habit, when it has been long con|tracted,
<PB N="331" REF="332"> has often made the <HI>Ambitious</HI> indo|lent, the
<HI>Prudent</HI> incon&s;iderate, the <HI>Active</HI> idle, and the
<HI>Indu&s;trious</HI> &s;lothful and negli|gent: So that their Affairs are
ruin'd for Want of <HI>Application,</HI> or, by being intru&s;ted in the Hands
of tho&s;e, who turn them wholly to their own Advantage, and to the Ruin of
tho&s;e who employ them.</P>
<P> AS <HI>Per&s;onal</HI> Vices are the Cau&s;e of pri|vate
Calamities, &s;o <HI>National</HI> Vices are the Grounds of National
Sufferings. And as no Vice does more Harm to particular Con&s;titu|tions, than
frequent Drinking to Exce&s;s, or lays the Foundation of more Di&s;ea&s;es, and
of more ill Humours, in them; there is none of our publick Vices, which does
more Harm to our National Con&s;titution, or occa&s;ions more Corruption in it
than this pernicious Habitude. And as this Cu&s;tom in particu|lar Per&s;ons
cau&s;es them to neglect their pri|vate Affairs, and either to leave them
wholly undone, or to leave them to be done by tho&s;e, who will make their
proper Advan|tage of them, tho' to the Ruin of tho&s;e who entru&s;ted them, as
has been &s;aid above; the &s;ame Thing is not unlike to happen to this
Drinking Nation.</P>
<P> TO be &s;atisfy'd of this, if we may judge of the Future by the
Pa&s;t, we need only ca&s;t an Eye back upon our <HI>Elections,</HI> in which
Thou&s;ands of <HI>Engli&s;h-men</HI> (as far as in them lay) have &s;old their
own <HI>Liberties,</HI> and the <HI>Liberty</HI> of their <HI>Country,</HI> for
<HI>Liquors. E&s;au</HI> <PB N="332" REF="333"> &s;old his <HI>Birth-Right</HI>
for a <HI>Me&s;s</HI> of <HI>Pottage</HI>; but then He &s;old only his
<HI>own</HI> Birth-Right, and he &s;old it to his <HI>Brother</HI>; and he
&s;old it to <HI>&s;upport Nature,</HI> in the <HI>Extremity</HI> of
<HI>Hunger.</HI> But Thou&s;ands of our <HI>Electors,</HI> have &s;old, (as far
as in them lay) not only their <HI>own</HI> Birth-Rights, their <HI>own</HI>
Liberties, but the Liberties and Birth-Rights of <HI>their Brethren,</HI> for
nau&s;eous Loads to <HI>oppre&s;s,</HI> and <HI>de&s;troy Nature.</HI> I know,
indeed, very well, that upon tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, in order to cor|rupt People,
there is a little of the <HI>Solid</HI> made U&s;e of &s;ometimes, as well as a
great deal of the <HI>Liquid.</HI> But I have a better Opinion of &s;ome of my
Countrymen, than to believe, That they would <HI>&s;ell</HI> their
<HI>Wives,</HI> their <HI>Children,</HI> and all their <HI>Po&s;terity,</HI>
for a <HI>Song,</HI> if, at the Time when They <HI>did</HI> it, They were
<HI>cool</HI> enough to con&s;ider, <HI>What it is they are about.</HI></P>
<P> THUS, my dear Friend, have I endea|vour'd to &s;hew the

<HI>Bodies, Minds,</HI> and <HI>Affairs.</HI> I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething of
the <HI>unrea&s;onable Apologies</HI> which the <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> of BACCHUS
make, for them|&s;elves: But, having run into more Length than I fir&s;t

<P>THE Force of <HI>Avarice</HI> is never &s;o con|&s;picuous, and
&s;o much to be wonder'd at, as when it taints the Minds of Per&s;ons eminent
in Quality and Circum&s;tance, &s;ecu|red, as one would think, again&s;t all
mean Temptations, by the large Revenues of a <HI>State Employment.</HI> It is
no &s;uch great Mat|ter of Surprize, when we &s;ee this Tincture of
Covetou&s;ne&s;s prevailing in a <HI>Mechanick,</HI> one who&s;e Birth and
Education are upon a Level; one, who has undergone a State of Servitude, who
has learn'd to be &s;craping and penurious by Habit and Example; and who, by a
Conver&s;ation with Dirt and &s;ervile Gain, makes the ama&s;&s;ing a Fortune
to be the chief End of Life. But we expect from a Gene|rous Birth, and a
Liberal Education, Senti|ments &s;uitable to their Dignity.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="344">WE &s;ee, 'tis true, this <HI>dirty</HI>
Pa&s;&s;ion often <HI>blotting</HI> the <HI>E&s;cutcheons</HI> of the Noble&s;t
Fami|lies: And we find at the &s;ame time our <HI>Re|&s;pect</HI> for their
<HI>Quality</HI> turn'd into a <HI>Contempt</HI> for their Per&s;ons. But how
much more de|&s;picable does this Vice appear, when we find it lodg'd in the
Brea&s;t of Him, who&s;e &s;up|pos'd Merit, and the Favour of his Prince, have
rai&s;ed him to pre&s;ide in <HI>Ju&s;tice?</HI> We at|tach Idea's of
Veneration to their Characters, who are <HI>Oracles</HI> of <HI>Law.</HI> We
look upon them as the Storehou&s;es of Wi&s;dom, and the Fountains of
Integrity: And were they, as it is &s;aid of the old <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>
Emperors, to appear in Publick but once in Seven Years, the Vul|gar, no doubt,
would carry up their Re&s;pect to the Pitch of <HI>Adoration.</HI></P>
<P>BUT our Deference for the&s;e Great Men is taken off, when we
&s;ee Frailties breaking thro' their Grandeur: When they pro&s;titute the
Sanctity of Honour and Con&s;cience, to Wealth, and unworthy Extor&s;ion. My
Lord <HI>COKE,</HI> I remember, &s;omewhere &s;peaking of <HI>Extortion</HI> in
a <HI>Judge,</HI> &s;ays, It is there wor&s;e than Robbery: For <HI>Robbery is
apparent, and hath the Face of a Crime; but Extortion puts on the Vi&s;or of
Vertue, for Expedition of Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a very fine Aphori&s;m, and worthy the Con&s;ideration of
all Ages and Countries, That <HI>a Judge ought to be &s;ea&s;on'd with two
Sorts of Salt; the Salt of</HI> Wi&s;dom, <HI>le&s;t he &s;hould appear a</HI>
Fool, <HI>and the Salt of</HI> Con&s;ci|ence, <PB N="344" REF="345"> <HI>le&s;t
he &s;hould appear a</HI> Devil. I cannot help recollecting, upon this
Occa&s;ion, a Pa&s;|&s;age of <HI>AELIAN,</HI> who &s;peaking of the
<HI>Egyptians,</HI> tells us, 
<Q REND="inline">'That they boa&s;ted to have receiv'd their
Sy&s;tem of Laws from <HI>Mercury:</HI> And that their Judges, whenever they
&s;ate upon the Deci&s;ion of Cau&s;es, wore, hanging upon their Brea&s;ts, by
a Chain of Gold, a Sa|phire Image, which was call'd <HI>Truth:</HI> But,
<HI>&s;ays the Author,</HI> I &s;hould think it better, that, in&s;tead of the
<HI>material</HI> Image dangling at their <HI>Bo&s;oms,</HI> they had the
<HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of it &s;tampt on their <HI>Souls.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I WAS led into this Trace of thinking, by Peru&s;al of tho&s;e
Pamphlets which have lately been publi&s;h'd, concerning the famous Lord
<HI>BACON</HI>; and of another I met with in the Window of a <HI>Member</HI> of
<HI>Parliament,</HI> which is call'd, <HI>The</HI> CASE <HI>of</HI> ORPHANS,
<HI>con&s;ider'd from Antiquity.</HI></P>
<P>THE Title Page tells us, That a Part of of its Subject is, <HI>On
the Court of Chancery, having the Di&s;po&s;ition of Orphans Money.</HI> As I
ob&s;erv'd &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in it, concerning the unrea&s;onable Tru&s;t
which has been put in the <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> of <HI>Chancery,</HI> I &s;hall
take the Liberty of tran&s;cribing a few, and making them a Part of this Day's
Entertainment.</P>
<Q> 
<P> I MUST freely confe&s;s, <HI>(&s;ays this Author)</HI> it is
always my Opinion, That a Lord CHANCELLOR was a mo&s;t proper
<HI>Tru&s;tee,</HI> and <HI>Guardian,</HI> of the Intere&s;ts of
<HI>Orphans,</HI> and <PB N="345" REF="346"> <HI>Widows.</HI> I have not
altogether retracted this Opinion, but I am &s;o diffident of my own weak
Judgment, that &s;trong Clamour, and &s;trong Arguments, per&s;wade me often
not to be too po&s;itive or tenacious of my Sentiments. I am not &s;o
perfectly, me|thinks, reconcil'd to a CHANCELLOR, and his <HI>Ma&s;ters,</HI>
having too intimate an Under&s;tanding with Each Other: And I begin to
&s;u&s;pect it a Degree of <HI>Harmony,</HI> in no wi&s;e e&s;&s;ential to the
Promotion of <HI>Equity.</HI></P> 
<P> IT has been, as I am told, but by a very modern <HI>Order,</HI>
that the <HI>Suiters</HI> Monies have been lodg'd in the Hands of the
<HI>Ma|&s;ters</HI>; and it may be to be wi&s;h'd that too many have not
Cau&s;e to be &s;orry an Order of that Kind ever took Place.</P> 
<P> THO' there be a loud Cry of <HI>Deficien|cy</HI> in the
<HI>Suiters</HI> Money &s;o lodg'd, I am not taking upon me to impeach the
Chara|cters of tho&s;e Gentlemen, but only to ob|&s;erve, That that
<HI>Order</HI> &s;eems to have been as ab&s;urd and unrea&s;onable, as it has
prov'd unhappy in its <HI>Con&s;equences.</HI> The Po&s;&s;e&s;|on of large
Sums of Money, and the di&s;|cretionary Power of approving what Secu|rities
they &s;hall be plac'd out on, is a Tru&s;t of &s;uch a Kind as might debauch
the Prin|ciples of Minds, not the mo&s;t &s;trongly in|trench'd in Hone&s;ty,
again&s;t the A&s;&s;aults of Avarice and Advantage. It gives a Li|berty, which
I hope was never taken, of <PB N="346" REF="347"> making Intere&s;t of that
Money in which they have no Property, and for which they are, barely
Tru&s;tees; and at the &s;ame Time of not paying One Shilling of its Produce to
the right Owners, under Colour that they have not had any proper Security
pro|pos'd, upon which they could certify it &s;afe and fitting to place it
out.</P> 
<P> WERE there not the unhappy <HI>Defici|encies,</HI> which are at
this Time talk'd of, I think &s;everal Ca&s;es of Con&s;cience might ari&s;e
upon the Po&s;&s;iblity of the <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> Conduct, with Regard to this
Tru&s;t. Sup|po&s;e only, for Example, during the late unaccountable
Fluctuation of <HI>Stocks,</HI> when the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Frenzy was at the
Height, and <HI>Money</HI> yielded the Intere&s;t of a <HI>whole Year</HI> for
the Loan of a <HI>few Hours,</HI> any im|men&s;e Fortunes had been made by the
clan|de&s;tine Application of tho&s;e very Monies, for which no Securities
could be found; or tho&s;e very Monies had been lo&s;t in an un|warrantable
Venture for private Profit: What Reparation &s;hould have been made to the
<HI>Suiters,</HI> or <HI>Orphans,</HI> who&s;e E&s;tates, in either Ca&s;e,
were &s;o <HI>happily,</HI> or <HI>unhappily,</HI> employ'd? Would they have
reap'd the Be|nefit of the fir&s;t <HI>Stock-jobbing</HI>; or was there the
lea&s;t Rea&s;on that they &s;hould &s;it down with the Lo&s;s of the
<HI>Latter?</HI> I make this but a Ca&s;e of Suppo&s;ition; and as it is
&s;carce probable that the &s;ame Frenzy &s;hould ever again po&s;&s;e&s;s us,
yet &s;hould it, the <PB N="347" REF="348"> Wi&s;dom of our PARLIAMENT is
providing, That the Monies of <HI>Orphans</HI> and other <HI>Suiters,</HI>
engag'd in <HI>Chancery,</HI> &s;hall not be &s;ubject to &s;uch Hazards.</P></Q>
<P>BUT &s;o much for Quotation. As I have above-mention'd the Name of
the Lord <HI>Chan|cellor BACON,</HI> who was accus'd by the Na|tion of
<HI>Bribery</HI> and <HI>Extortion,</HI> I &s;hall add a a few Words here with
Regard to his Con|duct under that Accu&s;ation. It has been rec|kon'd very
&s;ingular in his Ca&s;e, and He has been look'd upon as a Man of many
<HI>Fears,</HI> that he &s;hould de&s;ert his <HI>Defence,</HI> and, by a
<HI>Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of his Guilt, throw
him&s;elf on the Favour of the Parliament. But my Lord <HI>BACON,</HI> who, as
it has been ob&s;erv'd, knew that all Wounds ake with laying open, and that
Circum&s;tances are &s;ufficient to bla&s;t a Reputation, was re&s;olv'd to
avoid the Hazard of a publick Examina|tion. It may very often be wi&s;er to
carry Defects private, than to &s;tand too perempto|rily on a Ju&s;tification;
wherefore I look up|on the Saying to be of great Weight, <HI>That no Man has
&s;o many Faults, as he that takes upon him to have none at all.</HI></P>
<P>THIS puts me in Mind of a FABLE, that I read in my younger Years,
and which I &s;hall relate here, becau&s;e I am re&s;olv'd not to end with too
much Gravity.</P>
<Q><PB N="348" REF="349"> THERE was a Knot of good Com|panions that
enter'd into a Club, under certain Rules and Orders for the Go|vernment of the
Society. One Article among the re&s;t, was, 
<Q REND="inline">"That whoever &s;hould enroll him&s;elf a Member
of that <HI>Brotherhood,</HI> with any corporal <HI>Maim,</HI> or
<HI>Blemi&s;h</HI> about him, &s;hould forfeit a Crown to the Board; and for
&s;o many Defects, &s;o many Crowns."</Q> It fell out, that <HI>one</HI> Man in
the Company was ob&s;erv'd to go <HI>Limp|ing,</HI> and they call'd upon him
for his <HI>For|feit.</HI> The Man put him&s;elf upon the Te&s;t, and was
found, in the Search, to have not only one Leg longer than the other, but a
<HI>Scurff</HI> all over his Body. Upon this Di&s;co|very they demanded another
Crown, and then another, for a Gla&s;s-Eye he had. They pre&s;s'd him in the
End &s;o hard for the Mo|ney, that it came to <HI>Stripping,</HI> and upon that
Struggle, they found he had a Rupture: <HI>So that the further he pu&s;h'd his
Defence, his Conte&s;t become more Chargeable.</HI></Q>

<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>PLUTARCH</HI> to his <HI>WIFE: All Health.</HI></HEAD>
<P> THE Me&s;&s;enger you di&s;patched to tell me of the Death of
my little Daughter, it &s;eems mi&s;s'd his Way as he was going to
<HI>Athens:</HI> But when I came to <HI>Tanagra,</HI> I heard of it by my
Niece. I &s;uppo&s;e, by this Time, the Funeral is over. I wi&s;h, that
whatever happens, as well <HI>now,</HI> as <HI>hereafter,</HI> may create you
no Di&s;|&s;atisfaction. But if you have de&s;ignedly let any Thing alone,
depending upon my Judgment, I pray let it be, without <HI>Ce|remony</HI> and
<HI>timorous Super&s;tition,</HI> which I know are far from you. Only, dear
Wife! let <HI>You</HI> and <HI>I</HI> bear <HI>our</HI> Affliction with
Pa|tience.</P>
<P> I KNOW very well, and comprehend, <HI>what Lo&s;s</HI> we
have had; but if I &s;hould find you <HI>grieve, beyond Mea&s;ure,</HI> this
would trouble me more than the Thing <HI>it &s;elf:</HI> For I had my Birth
neither from a <HI>Stock,</HI> nor a <HI>Stone</HI>; and you know it full well;
I having been a&s;&s;i&s;tant to you in the <HI>Educa|cation</HI> of &s;o many
Children, which we <PB N="357" REF="358"> brought up at <HI>Home</HI> under our
<HI>own Care.</HI></P>
<P> THIS much lamented Daughter was born after Four Sons, which
made me call her by your <HI>own Name</HI>; therefore, I know &s;he was dear to
you; and Grief mu&s;t have a <HI>peculiar Pungency</HI> in a Heart <HI>tenderly
af|fectionate</HI> to <HI>Children</HI>; e&s;pecially when you call to Mind how
<HI>witty</HI> and <HI>innocent</HI> &s;he was, void of <HI>Anger,</HI> and not
<HI>querulous:</HI> She was naturally <HI>mild</HI> and
<HI>compa&s;&s;ionate</HI> to a Miracle; and gave Specimens of her
<HI>Humanity</HI> and <HI>Gratitude</HI> towards <HI>any Thing</HI> that had
oblig'd her; for &s;he would pray her Nur&s;e to give &s;uck not only to
<HI>other Children,</HI> but to her very <HI>Play-things</HI>; as it were,
courteou&s;ly inviting them to <HI>her Ta|ble,</HI> and making the be&s;t Chear
for them &s;he could. Now, my dear Wife, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why
<HI>the&s;e</HI> and the <HI>like</HI> Things, which delighted us &s;o much
when &s;he was alive, &s;hould, upon Remembrance of them, af|fect us when &s;he
is dead.</P>
<P> IT is but ju&s;t, That the &s;ame Arguments which we have
oftentimes u&s;ed to <HI>others,</HI> &s;hould prevail upon
<HI>our&s;elves</HI> at <HI>this</HI> &s;o <HI>&s;ea|&s;onable</HI> a Time; and
that we &s;hould not &s;upinely &s;it down, and overwhelm the Joys we <HI>have
ta&s;ted,</HI> with a Multiplicity of <HI>new Griefs.</HI> A vertuous Woman
ought thus to think with her&s;elf, That the Tem|pe&s;t of the Mind in violent
Grief mu&s;t be calmed by <HI>Patience</HI>; which does not in|trench 
<PB N="358" REF="359"> on the <HI>natural</HI> Love of Parents to|wards then
Children, as many think, but only &s;truggles again&s;t <HI>di&s;orderly</HI>
and <HI>irregu|lar</HI> Pa&s;&s;ions. For, we allow this <HI>Love</HI> of
<HI>Children</HI> to di&s;cover it&s;elf, in <HI>lamenting, wi&s;h|ing
for,</HI> and <HI>longing after</HI> them when they are dead. But the
<HI>exce&s;&s;ive Inclination</HI> to <HI>Grief,</HI> which carries People on
to <HI>un&s;eemly Exclamations</HI> and <HI>furious Behaviour,</HI> is no
le&s;s culpable than <HI>luxurious Intemperance.</HI> Yet Rea&s;on
<HI>&s;eems</HI> to plead in its Excu&s;e; becau&s;e, in&s;tead of
<HI>Plea&s;ure, Sorrow</HI> is an <HI>Ingredient</HI> of the <HI>Crime.</HI>
What can be more Irrational, I pray, than to check <HI>ex|ce&s;&s;ive
Laughter,</HI> and yet, give a free Cour&s;e to <HI>Tears,</HI> which flow from
the <HI>&s;ame Foun|tain?</HI></P>
<P> FORMERLY, you di&s;cover'd, on a <HI>like</HI> Occa&s;ion,
great Con&s;tancy of Mind, when you lo&s;t your <HI>Elde&s;t</HI> Son: And
again, when the lovely <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ron</HI> left us. For I remem|ber, when the News was brought me of
my Son's Death, as I was returning Home with &s;ome <HI>Friends</HI> and
<HI>Gue&s;ts,</HI> when they beheld <HI>all Things in Order,</HI> and
ob&s;erv'd a <HI>profound Silence</HI> every where (as they after|wards
declared to others) they thought <HI>no &s;uch</HI> Calamity had happened, but
that the Report was fal&s;e: So <HI>di&s;creetly</HI> had you &s;ettled the
Affairs of the Hou&s;e at that Time, when no &s;mall <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI> and
<HI>Di&s;order</HI> might have been expected. And yet you gave <HI>this</HI>
Son <HI>&s;uck</HI> your&s;elf, and endured the <PB N="359" REF="360">
<HI>lancing of your Brea&s;t,</HI> to prevent the ill Effects of a
Contu&s;ion.</P>
<P> THESE are Things worthy of a <HI>Generous Woman,</HI> that
<HI>loves</HI> her <HI>Children!</HI> Whereas, we &s;ee mo&s;t <HI>others</HI>
receive them in their Hands as <HI>Play-things,</HI> with a <HI>Feminine
Mirth</HI> and <HI>Jollity,</HI> and afterwards, if they chance to die, they
drench them&s;elves in <HI>exce&s;&s;ive Sorrow.</HI> Not that <HI>this</HI> is
any Ef|fect of their <HI>Love</HI> (for that <HI>gentle Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> acts
<HI>regularly</HI> and <HI>di&s;creetly!)</HI> it proceeds from a
<HI>De&s;ire</HI> of <HI>Vain-glory,</HI> mixed with a <HI>little natural
Affection,</HI> which renders their Mour|ning <HI>barbarous</HI> and
<HI>extravagant.</HI> Which Thing <HI>Ae&s;op</HI> knew very well, when he
tells the Story of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s giving Honours to the Gods: For it
&s;eems <HI>Grief</HI> al&s;o made <HI>her</HI> Demands; and it was granted,
That &s;he <HI>&s;hould be honoured,</HI> but only by Tho&s;e who were willing,
of <HI>their own Accord,</HI> to do it.</P>
<P> AND, indeed, <HI>this</HI> is the Beginning of Sorrow:
Every-body <HI>fir&s;t</HI> gives her <HI>free Ac|ce&s;s,</HI> and after &s;he
is once <HI>&s;ettled,</HI> and be|come <HI>familiar,</HI> &s;he will not be
forced thence with their <HI>be&s;t Endeavours.</HI> Therefore, &s;he mu&s;t be
re&s;i&s;ted at her <HI>fir&s;t Approach,</HI> nor mu&s;t we &s;urrender the
Fort to her by any <HI>exterior Signs,</HI> whether of <HI>Apparel,</HI> or
<HI>&s;ha|ving</HI> the <HI>Hair,</HI> or any other <HI>&s;uch like</HI>
Symp|toms of <HI>mournful Weakne&s;s</HI>; which, by De|grees, &s;o
<HI>enervate</HI> the <HI>Mind,</HI> and reduce her to &s;uch Streights, that,
quite <HI>dejected</HI> <PB N="360" REF="361"> and <HI>be&s;ieged</HI> with
<HI>Grief,</HI> the poor timorous Wretch <HI>dare not</HI> be merry, or &s;ee
the Light, or eat and drink in Company. The Inconvenience is accompanied by a
<HI>Neglect</HI> of the <HI>Body,</HI> with what&s;oever relates to the
<HI>Elegance</HI> of <HI>Humane Life.</HI>&mdash;Whereas, on the contrary, the
Soul, when it is <HI>di&s;ordered,</HI> ought to receive <HI>Aid</HI> from the
<HI>Vigor</HI> of a <HI>healthful Body.</HI> For the <HI>&s;harpe&s;t Edge</HI>
of the <HI>Soul's Grief,</HI> is <HI>rebated,</HI> when the <HI>Body</HI> is in
<HI>Tranquility,</HI> like the Sea in a Calm. But, where from an ill Cour&s;e
of Diet, the Body becomes <HI>dry</HI> and <HI>hot,</HI> &s;o that it can|not
&s;upply the Soul with <HI>commodious</HI> and <HI>&s;erene Spirits</HI>; but
only breathes forth <HI>me|lancholy Vapours,</HI> which annoy her with
<HI>Sad|ne&s;s</HI>; there, it is difficult for a Man (tho' never &s;o willing)
to recover the <HI>Tranquility</HI> of his <HI>Mind,</HI> after it hath been
di&s;turbed with &s;o many <HI>evil Affections.</HI></P>
<P> BUT that which is mo&s;t to be dreaded in this Ca&s;e, does
not at all affrighten me; to wit, The <HI>Vi&s;its</HI> of <HI>fooli&s;h
Women,</HI> and their accompanying You in Your <HI>Tears</HI> and
<HI>Lamentations</HI>; by which they <HI>&s;harpen</HI> Grief, not &s;uffering
it either of <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> or by the Help of <HI>others,</HI> to fade and
vani&s;h away. For, I am not ignorant how great a Combat you lately entered,
when you a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Si&s;ter of <HI>Theon,</HI> and oppo&s;ed the Women
who came running in with <HI>horrid Cries,</HI> bringing <HI>Fewel,</HI> as it
were, to her Pa&s;&s;ion. When Men &s;ee their Neigh|bour's 
<PB N="361" REF="362"> <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> on Fire, every one contributes his
utmo&s;t to <HI>quench</HI> it: But when they &s;ee the Mind inflamed with
furious Pa&s;&s;ion, they bring <HI>Fewel</HI> to <HI>nouri&s;h</HI> and
<HI>increa&s;e</HI> it. When a Man's <HI>Eye</HI> is in Pain, he is not
&s;uffered to touch it, tho' the Inflammation provoke him to it, nor will they
that are near him meddle with it. But he who is gall'd with <HI>Grief,</HI>
&s;its and expo&s;es his Di|&s;temper to <HI>every one,</HI> like Waters that
all may poach in; and &s;o that which at fir&s;t &s;eem'd a <HI>light</HI> or
<HI>trivial Smart,</HI> by much <HI>Fretting</HI> and <HI>Provoking,</HI>
becomes <HI>great,</HI> and <HI>incurable.</HI></P>
<P> I WOULD have you endeavour to call to Mind <HI>that
Time,</HI> when our Daughter was not, as yet, born to us: Then, joining
<HI>that</HI> Time with <HI>this,</HI> argue thus with your &s;elf, we are
<HI>now</HI> in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Condition as <HI>then:</HI> Otherwi&s;e,

The <HI>Two Years</HI> of her <HI>Life</HI> are, by no means, to be forgotten,
by us, but to be numbered among&s;t our <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings,</HI> in that they
afforded us an <HI>agreeable Plea&s;ure.</HI> Shall we not e&s;teem a

ungratefully complain again&s;t Fortune for what &s;he has <HI>actually given
us,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he has not added <HI>what we wi&s;h
for?</HI>&mdash;Certainly, to &s;peak reverently of the Gods, and to bear our
<HI>lot</HI> with an <HI>even</HI> <PB N="362" REF="363"> <HI>Mind,</HI>
without <HI>accu&s;ing Fortune,</HI> always brings with it a <HI>fair
Reward.</HI> And he, who in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, calls <HI>pro&s;perous Things</HI>
to Mind, and, turning his Thoughts from <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>melancholy</HI>
Objects, fixes them on <HI>bright</HI> and <HI>chearful</HI> Ones; will either
quite <HI>extingui&s;h</HI> his <HI>Grief,</HI> or, by <HI>allaying</HI> it
with <HI>contrary</HI> Sentiments will render it more <HI>feeble.</HI></P>
<P> TRUE <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>right
Coun&s;els</HI> of the Mind, tending to its own <HI>con&s;tant
E&s;tabli&s;hment;</HI> and the <HI>Changes</HI> of <HI>Fortune</HI> are of no

like a <HI>Book,</HI> it hath but <HI>one Blot</HI> in it, and all the re&s;t
be <HI>fair</HI> and <HI>candid.</HI></P>
<P> DO not You, therefore take Notice of the Tears and Moans of
<HI>&s;uch</HI> as <HI>vi&s;it you,</HI> at <HI>pre&s;ent, condoling</HI> your

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> WHILE I intended to have &s;ent you an <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> on
<HI>Plain-Dealing,</HI> I fell in|to a Conver&s;ation, which furni&s;hed me
with it, and the Narrative will be thought a more lively Entertainment. The
Society was compo&s;ed of &s;ome of your old &s;tandard Friends, who&s;e
agreeable Characters gave Life to your Under&s;tanding.&mdash;I was car|ried
thither to have the Honour of being introduced to the <HI>Plain Dealer</HI>;
but, it &s;eems, you were taking Ob&s;ervations from your Watch-Tower of
<HI>Barbican,</HI> concern|ing which, I make no doubt, we &s;hall hear
&s;omething to our Advantage; and &s;o, as it happen'd, I mi&s;s'd the
Plea&s;ure which had <PB N="366" REF="367"> been promi&s;ed me. However, as
your Ad|mirer, I beg to be admitted into the Num|ber of your Corre&s;pondents,
while I inform you, That the Company I met, were the <HI>Clergyman,</HI> the
<HI>Critick,</HI> Major <HI>Stedfa&s;t, Ned Volatile,</HI> and your own dear
<HI>Patty Amble.</HI></P>
<P> THE good Gentleman in Black, took Occa&s;ion, from our Speaking
of the Title of your Paper, to di&s;tingui&s;h a <HI>Plain Dealer</HI> from a
<HI>Rough Dealer:</HI> That is, a Man, who&s;e Knowledge and Genero&s;ity
in&s;pire him with a Delight in befriending Man|kind, from the brutal
Impertinent, who&s;e Ignorance but <HI>affects</HI> Meaning, and prompts him to
&s;uppo&s;e he appears Wi&s;e&s;t, when mo&s;t in&s;ufferably Shocking. The
Virtues of <HI>Plain Dealing,</HI> &s;aid he, are, by awkard Imi|tators,
deba&s;ed into Ill-Manners, and In|humanity. The Brute, who boa&s;ts of his
<HI>Bluntne&s;s,</HI> is a loud Cen&s;urer of other Mens Conduct, and never
right in his own.&mdash;His Eloquence is a Froth of Expre&s;&s;ion, without
Depth, or Per&s;picuity.&mdash;While his Depravity mi&s;takes Brutalities for
Beau|ties, the Graces of human Life are rejected by him as Frailties! Becau&s;e
his own Na|ture is impenetrably obdurate, he calls Ob|&s;tinacy
<HI>Magnanimity!</HI> Compa&s;&s;ion for the Afflicted, is a <HI>Weakne&s;s in
the Mind</HI>; and a Readine&s;s to forgive Injuries, an <HI>Affectation,</HI>
or <HI>Deficiency</HI> of <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P> The <HI>Plain Dealer,</HI> refining <HI>Nature,</HI> by
Principle, acts the Inqui&s;itor within him|&s;elf, <PB N="367" REF="368"> and
throws out a Light of Example, as well as In&s;truction, upon the
World.&mdash;The Former in&s;ults the Unfortunate with Cen&s;ure; but the
Latter, reproaching only the Proud and Pro&s;perous, <HI>corrodes</HI> not the
Wounds of the Afflicted, by in&s;i&s;ting on pa&s;t, and irretrievable
Mi&s;carriges. Yet, by &s;ome gentle Allu&s;ion to their Actions, he awakens a
Reflection, that can arm them for their future Safety.&mdash;We judge of Things
impartially upon a Surprize, by &s;uch Compari&s;on; and, condemning our own
Faults in others, are forced to &s;tand &s;elf-convicted, when the
<HI>Recoil</HI> is made up|on our &s;elves.</P>
<P> But the Barbarity of a <HI>profound Pedant</HI> is &s;till
wor&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, than that of a <HI>&s;hal|low Impertinent.</HI> The
Ignorance of the one, can only move us to Contempt; but the Learning of the
other, provokes our Dete|&s;tation. Tho' Envy may hurt Genius, by urging it, in
the Di&s;gui&s;e of Flattery, up|on too ardent and improper E&s;&s;ays, yet, in
the dogmatizing Pedant, it has &s;hock'd Worth much more fatally at its fir&s;t
&s;etting out; and extingui&s;h'd a Spirit, which no Encouragement could
re-kindle. A Pe|dant ungratefully turns that Force to the Di&s;couragement of
Learning, with whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Learning has
arm'd him to make War again&s;t Ignorance.&mdash;While the <HI>Plain
Dealer</HI> reproves, he &s;ets <HI>Merits</HI> again&s;t <HI>Er|rors,</HI> and
the <HI>Lu&s;tre</HI> of the one, deepens the <PB N="368" REF="369">
<HI>Shade</HI> of the other! To di&s;play but the dark Side a Man, either damps
him with a Ter|ror, that incapacitates him for Action, or di&s;gu&s;ts him into
a &s;tubborn Indulgence of tho&s;e Follies he would otherwi&s;e have grown
a&s;hamed of. Roughne&s;s in Conver|&s;ation, being like Per&s;ecution in
Religion, Pro&s;elytes are gain'd &s;oone&s;t by a gentle Manner of
Per&s;ua&s;ion; and I am pleas'd with a Saying that is recorded of King
<HI>Henry the Fourth</HI> of <HI>France.&mdash;A Drop of Honey draws more
Flies, than a Spoonful of Vine|gar.</HI></P>
<P> IN &s;hort, the Force of a fine In&s;truction ought to &s;trike
like a Fla&s;h of Lightning! As the Subtilty of the one, is &s;aid to
di&s;|&s;olve the Bone, without brui&s;ing the Fle&s;h; the other, with a
Surprize of Influence, &s;hoots Remor&s;e thro' the Heart, before the Temper
can be ruffled into a Di&s;po&s;ition to repul&s;e it. In this Light, a
<HI>Plain Dealer</HI> is a Father, or rather a Friend, which is yet
dearer.&mdash;A Father may leave us Wealth and Titles, from which we may derive
Au|thority or Di&s;tinction; but &s;uch a Friend, can teach us to be wi&s;e,
and Wi&s;dom illu|&s;trates Ob&s;curity, and adorns Dignity with an Eminence
&s;uperior to that of Fortune; it ve&s;ts us too with the noble&s;t
<HI>Power,</HI> for it enables us to govern our
Pa&s;&s;ions.&mdash;<HI>Alexander</HI> ju&s;tly preferr'd his Ma&s;ter
<HI>Ari|&s;totle</HI> to his Father <HI>Philip. The King,</HI> &s;aid he,
<HI>but made me a Prince, the Philo&s;opher made me a Man.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="370"> I OBSERV'D, That your dear <HI>Patty
Am|ble,</HI> delighting to <HI>talk much,</HI> took little Plea|&s;ure in
giving <HI>Attention.</HI> But that Lady urges her <HI>Sex's Privilege,</HI>
when &s;he declares an Antipathy to <HI>Plain Dealing.</HI> Ah! cri|ed the
charming <HI>Coquet,</HI> how preferable is Flattery to <HI>Plain Dealing?</HI>
I know, that, in the common Cant, Flattery is &s;aid to be <HI>gro&s;s</HI>;
that it is called, The <HI>Craft</HI> of the <HI>Courtier!</HI> The
<HI>Seducer</HI> of <HI>Beauty!</HI> and, The vain Promi&s;er of a Happine&s;s,
which it ne|ver means to be&s;tow! But, let me tell you, they had done it more
Ju&s;tice, had they cal|led it, The <HI>Soother</HI> of <HI>Di&s;content!</HI>
The <HI>Re|finer</HI> of <HI>Fancy!</HI> The <HI>Imbelli&s;hment</HI> of
<HI>Con|ver&s;ation!</HI> The very <HI>In&s;pirer</HI> of <HI>polite
Plea|&s;ures!</HI>&mdash;What a Delicacy of Delight &s;hould we lo&s;e, were
that odious <HI>Plain Deal|ing</HI> to prevail? Mr. <HI>Volatile</HI> would no
lon|ger give the <HI>Tattling</HI> of a Lady, the com|plai&s;ant Term of
<HI>Liveline&s;s</HI>; nor the <HI>Major</HI> &s;often our Sex's Levities with
the pretty Title of, <HI>Innocent Amu&s;ements.</HI> Our Ex|pence in Dre&s;s,
Equipage, Ma&s;querades, and <HI>Opera Sub&s;criptions,</HI> would lo&s;e the
agreeable Name of <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> for that hideous one of
<HI>Extravagance</HI>; &s;o that our darling Modes of Thinking, which we have
&s;o long been told, are owing to our Rea&s;on and Di&s;cernment, would then be
forc'd to wear a much more mortifying Title, and be cal|led, Our downright
<HI>Vanity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="371"> I WAS willing to take the Advantage of
this Pau&s;e but could not re&s;i&s;t the Plea&s;ure of li&s;tening to that
ever-rambling, ever-agreeable Tongue! What Lover (continu|ed the inchanting
Trifler) would not rather be <HI>flatter'd</HI> into Hope, then abandon'd to
De&s;pair by <HI>Plain Dealing?</HI> The Coxcomb delightfully deceives
him&s;elf, by fancying our very <HI>Denials</HI> to be Tokens of our fu|ture
Favours. The Man of Sen&s;e (who, when a <HI>Lover,</HI> is, of Cour&s;e, to be
<HI>mi&s;taken</HI>) believes the Charmer, he admires, has a Wit as penetrating
as her Eyes; and, vain of the real Worth he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, becomes Fool
enough, in his Turn, to think <HI>Merit</HI> a Re|commendation to the
Ladies!&mdash;Thus, when you flatter <HI>Us,</HI> you appear agreeable, when we
flatter <HI>You,</HI> we &s;ecure our Con|que&s;ts; and when we Both flatter
<HI>Our&s;elves,</HI> we con&s;ult and pre&s;erve our Quiet. The&s;e are
Plea&s;ures, which <HI>Plain Dealing</HI> would intirely deface, and
aboli&s;h.</P>
<P> BUT, Madam, cried <HI>Ned Volatile,</HI> as Beaus and Ladies
admire Things for their <HI>Novelty,</HI> we Men of Speculation, approve them
mo&s;t for their <HI>Antiquity.</HI>&mdash;A Man of Dre&s;s, is pleas'd with a
Sword-Knot and Cane-String, after the newe&s;t Fa&s;hion; while a
<HI>Virtuo&s;o</HI> prefers a ru&s;ty <HI>Roman Javelin</HI> to the White Wand
of a Lord-Trea&s;urer.&mdash;The Herald derives the Honour of Fami|lies from
their <HI>Antiquity:</HI> And &s;ince there can be no Doubt, but
<HI>Flattery</HI> is more <PB N="371" REF="372"> <HI>ancient,</HI> it mu&s;t
therefore be more <HI>honour|able</HI> than <HI>Plain Dealing.</HI></P>
<P> <HI>Plain Dealing,</HI> interrupted the <HI>Critick,</HI> had
been more gracefully drawn, in the fa|vourite Character of Mr.
<HI>Wicherley</HI>'s Come|dy; if his good Qualities, remaining equal|ly
&s;trong, had been &s;often'd, to appear more <HI>amiable.</HI> But his
Judgment is mix'd with Partiality, and his Wit with Ill-manners. He's impatient
of Contradiction, and ex|ceeds, in Self-conceitedne&s;s, the very Cox|combs he
contemns.&mdash;As a <HI>Lover,</HI> his Indecency checks our Regard, and
&s;eems to ju&s;tifie the Ill-u&s;age which he meets with.</P>
<P> COULD <HI>Plain-Dealing</HI> (ob&s;erv'd the <HI>Ma|jor</HI>)
be forgiven among the <HI>Great,</HI> it would <HI>both adorn</HI> and
<HI>defend</HI> them. On the contrary, <HI>Double Dealing,</HI> which is an
Accompli&s;h|ment they are fond of, has been more dan|gerous to Princes, than
the mo&s;t open Re|bellion. Had <HI>Tarquin</HI> never tru&s;ted the
Di&s;&s;imulation of the Fir&s;t <HI>Brutus,</HI> the Ex|pul&s;ion of his Race
had been prevented: And, I think, it may ea&s;ily be determined, by the
Unprejudiced, how far the admired La&s;t of that Name deviated from his
boa&s;ted <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> when he con&s;pired again&s;t the Man who&s;e
Intere&s;t he e&s;pou&s;ed, and who&s;e par|ticular Affection had pardon'd,
promoted, and confided in him; when, in the Per&s;on of that God-like
<HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> he a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated his <HI>Father,</HI> his
<HI>Friend,</HI> and his <HI>Pre&s;erver.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="373"> I HAD now an Opportunity to offer my
Sentiments, in my Turn; and ventur'd to interpo&s;e as follows.&mdash;Were
<HI>Plain Dealing</HI> a Court Vertue, it would free great Num|bers from the
Mi&s;ery of a vain Dependance, and avoid the Re&s;entment of tho&s;e, whom
<HI>Double Dealing</HI> di&s;appoints, or makes In|&s;truments of. Greatne&s;s
proves often too weak a Protection; for the meane&s;t Adver|&s;ary may become
<HI>con&s;iderable</HI> in <HI>Mi&s;chief.</HI> However an angry Multitude may
<HI>vary</HI> in their Tempers, their Pa&s;&s;ions, like different Arrows,
carry all the &s;ame Sharpne&s;s, and are commonly pointed at <HI>one
Mark.</HI>&mdash;Up|on the Whole, If <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> is better than
<HI>Cunning,</HI> if <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> may be allowed the <HI>&s;afe&s;t</HI>
Principle of <HI>Policy</HI>; there is then this Difference betwixt <HI>Double
Dealing</HI> and <HI>Plain Dealing</HI>; The one, confounds Families and
Kingdoms, and renders the Guilty, when di&s;cover'd, dete&s;table, even in the
Grave: The other confirms Ju&s;tice, bani&s;hes Di|&s;tru&s;t from
Corre&s;pondence, &s;trengthens Friend&s;hip in <HI>Private</HI>; and in
<HI>Publick,</HI> is the Mark of a <HI>Patriot</HI>; and will tran&s;mit the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or's Memory to the Affection of future Ages.</P>

<P> I AM a Young Fellow, left by my Pa|rents without any

Fortune, but what I may, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of that, hope to rai&s;e in my

a cer|tain Young Lady, who is one of your Rea|ders. She is at once,
Mi&s;tre&s;s of the greate&s;t <HI>Sen&s;e, Knowledge, Wit,</HI> and

<HI>each</HI> of which by it&s;elf (po&s;&s;e&s;s'd to that eminent Degree,

&s;he honours with her Choice, <HI>compleatly happy!</HI> She has, for &s;ome
Time, admitted me to the Favour of vi&s;iting her, and treats me, on all
Occa&s;ions, with the greate&s;t Civility. I have heard her often &s;ay, She
thought <HI>the Law</HI> (to which, by this Time, you perceive I belong) the
mo&s;t <HI>Genteel,</HI> and <HI>Honourable,</HI> of all Profe&s;&s;ions; That
&s;he never would marry for <HI>Money</HI>;&mdash;And a Hundred &s;uch Things,

<P><PB N="375" REF="376">THE Ca&s;e of my Corre&s;pondent is pretty
nice, and as this &s;eems to be a Matter of the greate&s;t Importance to both
Parties, I think I cannot be&s;tow a Paper better, than in taking it into
Con&s;ideration, and in giving &s;ome Advice, that may be of Service to all,
who are in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the Affair of <HI>Marriage,</HI> as it is now
generally carried on in the World, there are innumerable Difficulties, which
damp pur&s;uits of that Kind, in a Young Fellow, who, let him de&s;erve ever
&s;o well in other Re&s;pects, wants (what the World <HI>alone</HI> e&s;teems
<HI>Merit)</HI> an ESTATE.</P>
<P>SOME of the&s;e Difficulties ari&s;e from the <HI>Women
them&s;elves.</HI>&mdash;There are few among them to be found, who have any
Notion of Enjoyments, beyond mere <HI>&s;en&s;ual</HI> Gratificati|ons. A
<HI>Ma&s;querade</HI> affords them infinitely more Plea&s;ure, than the
brighte&s;t Conver&s;a|tion; a <HI>Diamond</HI> has more Charms, than any of
the moral Virtues; and, I doubt not, there are &s;ome, who, for the Sake of
riding in a Coach and Six, would Yoke them&s;elves with a <HI>verier
Bea&s;t,</HI> than any in their <HI>own Equipage.</HI> Let any one Traffick
with them for the dear Delights of <HI>Wealth,</HI> they will <HI>buy,</HI>
even at the <HI>highe&s;t Price</HI>;&mdash;That is, They will pay the
Purcha&s;e in what they prize mo&s;t&mdash;<HI>Them&s;elves.</HI>&mdash;And,
tho' hardly any Match, on the&s;e Con&s;iderations alone, has ever yet proved
happy, They &s;till <PB N="376" REF="377"> go on;&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding they
are &s;ure to <HI>repent,</HI> They never fail to make the <HI>Choice.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<L>How wretched is the faithful Youth,</L> 
<L>Since Womens Hearts were <HI>Bought</HI> and <HI>Sold!</HI></L> 
<L>They ask not Vows of &s;acred <HI>Truth,</HI></L> 
<L>Whene'er they &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">gh,
they &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">gh for

<P>OTHER Women there are, indeed, who&s;e Minds, of a le&s;s
mercenary Ca&s;t, con&s;ider only the <HI>Merit</HI> of their Admirers; who are
capable of receiving that Love which flows from <HI>E&s;teem,</HI> and of
ta&s;ting Happine&s;s from <HI>rational Enjoyments.</HI> But, how few of
the&s;e enjoy the Liberty of <HI>choo&s;ing for them&s;elves?</HI> How many
groan under the Tyranny of an Avaritious Parent? who would no more part with
his Daughter, than his Land, to any but the <HI>be&s;t Purcha&s;er.</HI> How
would he <HI>Scoff</HI> at a Young Man's Impudence? who, in&s;tead of paying
<HI>Her Price,</HI> &s;hould pretend to talk of Her <HI>Happine&s;s!</HI></P>
<P>FROM thus much of the Sex, then, <HI>Money|le&s;s Merit</HI>
&s;eems intirely excluded. The Woman who has <HI>Liberty,</HI> as well as
<HI>Capacity,</HI> to make a prudent Choice, is the only one with whom we can
hope Succe&s;s. And here ari&s;e new Difficulties, from another Side; The
<HI>Men</HI> are <HI>now</HI> our Hindrance, and one in my Corre&s;pondent's
Circum&s;tances, mu&s;t ex|pect <HI>him&s;elf</HI> to &s;uffer for the general
ill Cha|racter of his <HI>Sex.</HI> Men daily &s;hew them|&s;elves 
<PB N="377" REF="378"> as little <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted,</HI> in their
Pur&s;uits, as Women. <HI>Age, Folly,</HI> and <HI>Ill-Nature,</HI> are no
Impediments to them, provided there be but <HI>Money.</HI>&mdash;Love, and
E&s;teem, are &s;o frequently u&s;ed as Pretences, while the real Affection is
only for the Fortune, that Women are alarm'd at the fir&s;t Approach; and a
Young Fellow dares hardly Love, where Prudence only permits him to Love,
without incurring the odious Title of a <HI>For|tune-hunter.</HI></P>
<P>IF therefore my Corre&s;pondent &s;incerely feels, within
him&s;elf, that di&s;intere&s;ted Affe|ction, which he &s;eems to act by, I
would advi&s;e him to take all po&s;&s;ible Methods to <HI>convince</HI> the
Lady of it; I need not direct him <HI>how</HI>; for, if he is &s;incere, his

let him be <HI>ha&s;ty,</HI> in his Addre&s;&s;es.&mdash;With a Lady of her
Sen&s;e, his <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> will add much to his <HI>Influence.</HI> True
Love &s;prings not upon a &s;udden, and &s;hould he urge his Wi&s;hes, too far,

&s;he might ra|tionally con&s;true his Forwardne&s;s to proceed from other
Motives, than the genuine Effects of his per&s;onal, and di&s;intere&s;ted,
Admira|tion.</P>
<P>ON the other Side, I mu&s;t take upon me to remind the Young Lady,
that <HI>Time</HI> is more in ha&s;te, than <HI>&s;he</HI> is; and I would
ad|vi&s;e her, if &s;he is (as I pre&s;ume) at her own Di&s;po&s;al, and if
&s;he is &s;atisfied of the <HI>Merit,</HI> <PB N="378" REF="379"> as well as
the Affection, of our Young Law|yer (as one of the Sen&s;e he a&s;cribes to

Happine&s;s in Marriage, does not depend on Suitablene&s;s of
<HI>E&s;tates,</HI> but of <HI>Tempers.</HI> If there be but a Competency on

<HEAD>To the <HI>PLAIN-DEALER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I AM &s;eldom negligent, in my Atten|dance at the
Coffee-Hou&s;e, upon tho&s;e Days, when you favour the World with your
Lectures;&mdash;You very prudently entertain us, with a great deal of
<HI>Variety:</HI> Which is, doubtle&s;s, the mo&s;t ready, and in|fallible
Means of <HI>Improvement.</HI> For, if you altogether treated about Religious
or Mo|ral Duties, you would be di&s;regarded by your <HI>gay</HI> Readers, and
reli&s;h'd only by your <PB N="383" REF="384"> <HI>Rational.</HI> But as we are
ignorant of what you will di&s;cour&s;e, 'till we take up your Papers, we may,
out of Curio&s;ity, be una|wares catched, by an <HI>Admonition</HI> in
<HI>Ma&s;|querade,</HI> under the Di&s;gui&s;e of a mere
Amu&s;ement.&mdash;</P>
<P> YOU have indulged no ob&s;cene, or im|moral Reflections: But
have, on the con|trary, di&s;countenanced <HI>Vice</HI>; and &s;upported
Religion, with Vivacity, and Frankne&s;s of Spirit; con&s;equently, the
<HI>Incon&s;iderate</HI> may, by Degrees, be awakened into an Exertion of the
<HI>Thinking Faculty</HI>; by which chiefly we are di&s;tingui&s;hed, and
&s;upport our boa&s;t|ed Superiority, over the <HI>brutal</HI> Creation. A
virtuous Reader of your Paper can at wor&s;t but be render'd <HI>chearful,</HI>
without Violation of his <HI>Innocence.</HI>&mdash;And your Writings being
generally <HI>plea&s;ing,</HI> and very often <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> I flatter my
&s;elf, That Men are not &s;o aban|doned to Ignorance, as we are ready to
ima|gine, &s;ince they give &s;uch a kind Accepta|tion to you E&s;&s;ays, which
have no mean, or ungenerous Gratifications to recommend them.&mdash;</P>
<P> I LEARN, from your <HI>Plain Dealing,</HI> to be inoffen&s;ive
in Conver&s;ation; I ob&s;erve all that pa&s;&s;es, wherever I happen to be;
and endeavour, at the &s;ame Time, to <HI>contract</HI> or <HI>extend</HI> my
&s;elf, till I am grown <HI>fit</HI> for my Company. Though, by the Way, we
&s;hould re&s;olutely pre&s;erve this mo&s;t rea&s;on|able <HI>Steadine&s;s, on
no Account whatever, to</HI> <PB N="384" REF="385"> <HI>humour a Friend at the
Expence of our Health, our Reputation, or our Virtue.</HI> FRIEND, did I &s;ay?
I retract the Appellation;&mdash;For certainly, if we think right, that
Per&s;on who &s;olicites us to Actions incon&s;i&s;tent with Rea|&s;on, with
Honour, or with Decency, is un|de&s;erving of &s;o &s;ublime a
Character.&mdash;But (this &s;ingle Exception allow'd for) we &s;hould
conde&s;cend to appear blind to the Weak|ne&s;&s;es of tho&s;e we conver&s;e
with&mdash;And he, who acts otherwi&s;e, will ju&s;tly incur the Cen&s;ure of
an odious, and &s;cornful Au&s;te|rity.&mdash;A Man's <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Care
&s;hould be to avoid the Reproaches of his own Heart, and his <HI>&s;econd</HI>
to e&s;cape the ill Wi&s;hes of other People.</P>
<P> WE learn, with Delight, from &s;uch <HI>Plain Dealing</HI> as
yours, That a wi&s;e Man's Bu&s;i|ne&s;s is to &s;ubdue the Roughne&s;s of
Pa&s;&s;ion, into the Calmne&s;s of a tranquil Humility; And that the more his
Knowledge is en|larg'd, the more he will perceive <HI>wanting,</HI> to be
&s;earch'd after. <HI>Tully</HI> tells us, The Mind of a wi&s;e Man never
<HI>&s;wells,</HI> nor be|comes <HI>elated.</HI> For my own Part, I fancied my
&s;elf, when I was young, to be acquaint- with every Thing: But now, I can
perceive my Learning contracted with a narrow Cir|cle, and almo&s;t ob&s;cured
in a <HI>dark Point</HI>; when compared with that infinite, and
in|exhau&s;tible Number of Subjects, to which I am an utter Stranger. In a
Word, I am convinced, That an ill-grounded Conceit|edne&s;s 
<PB N="385" REF="386"> of our own Abilities is the mo&s;t con|temptible
Weakne&s;s of Nature: And, even where it may &s;eem ju&s;tified, by our real
Merit, it renders odious, and &s;upportable, the very <HI>Virtue,</HI> which
Occa&s;ions it.</P>
<P> BUT, to make a Tran&s;ition, from what <HI>I learn from</HI>
you, to an Information I intend to <HI>give you</HI>; There is a pretty Maxim
in the <HI>Guardian,</HI> to <HI>think</HI> with the <HI>Wi&s;e,</HI> but
<HI>talk</HI> with the <HI>Vulgar</HI>: Which occurr'd &s;trongly to my Memory,
upon ob&s;erving with what Plea&s;ure your late <HI>Cambridge</HI> Letter,
con|cerning &s;ome little feminine Exravagancies, was received in all
Places.&mdash;Give me Leave, therefore, to entertain you with a &s;trange, and
fearful Di&s;covery, which, it was lately my Fortune to make, upon pa&s;&s;ing
a Night or Two, in a Country Village.&mdash;It was in a Ramble, la&s;t
Harve&s;t, I had the Honour to wait on a <HI>Widow,</HI> (as well
<HI>&s;tor'd</HI> as the <HI>Fields</HI> were) in a kind of
<HI>Progre&s;s,</HI> to vi&s;it her Tenants.&mdash;</P>
<P> AFTER Dinner, one Day, I left the good Company, with their
hone&s;t Entertainers, the Farmer and his narrative Family, to accompany the
<HI>Inhabitants</HI> of the <HI>Yard</HI>; and enjoy the &s;ilent Serenity of a
very beau|tiful Pro&s;pect; which was bounded by the Shade of Trees and Hills,
with ruin'd Buildings, at a little Di&s;tance from the Cot|tage.&mdash;I was
envying the Happine&s;s, and Quiet, of the&s;e unbu&s;y People; and had
wander'd, as it were in&s;en&s;ibly, over half a <PB N="386" REF="387"> Dozen
Stiles, into the Remotene&s;s of a hollow &s;andy way: Where I &s;tood with
great Delight, to ob&s;erve the Fall of a pret|ty <HI>Rill,</HI> which
gu&s;hing out from among the Ru&s;hes above, roll'd down the &s;andy Bank, and
&s;hap'd it &s;elf a Pa&s;&s;age, along the Bot|tom of the Road I walk'd in.
The Gloomi|ne&s;s that was &s;pread all round, had fitted this Place, above all
I had ever &s;een, for the Abode of fanta&s;tick Melancholly: And whil&s;t I
was bu&s;ied in Thoughts of this Nature, I &s;aw a Country Woman ha|&s;ten
towards me, who wav'd her Hand, as &s;he came forward, and cried out to me, to
<HI>walk on.&mdash;For I was &s;tanding at Gooddy</HI> Hubbard<HI>'s watering
Place!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P> AS &s;oon as the good Woman came near enough to be ask'd,
<HI>What &s;he meant,</HI> I found, that Gooddy <HI>Hubbard</HI> was a
<HI>Witch,</HI> that lived in the Wood: And, that if any <HI>Cow, Hor&s;e,</HI>
or other Cattle, &s;taid long enough in that Place, to drink of its
<HI>enchanted Water,</HI> All the Hay they &s;hould eat, from that Time
forward, would be turned into <HI>crooked Pins,</HI> and the poor Bea&s;ts
mu&s;t certainly <HI>die after it.</HI> I begged &s;he would go along with me,
to &s;hew me the Witch's Hou&s;e: To which Propo&s;ition &s;he replied, with
inexpre&s;&s;ible Con&s;ternati|on, <HI>She would not, for the World, be &s;o
pre|&s;umptuous:</HI> She added, That it was about half a Mile off, and &s;hook
her Head, and a&s;&s;ured me, that the whole Village trem|bled 
<PB N="387" REF="388"> at the Sight of this <HI>Goody Hubbard.</HI> That, for
her own Part very lately, as &s;he was Gleaning in a Field, by the Wood's Side,
the Witch had appeared to her out of the Hedge, in the Shape of the Leaf of a
Tree: And ran along before her, and play'd Gambols, over and over in her Path,
all the Way, as &s;he came home again.&mdash;I ask'd her, Whether &s;he had
found any ill Con&s;equence, after &s;o terrible an Accident? And &s;he
an&s;wer'd, (with great Innocence and Gravity) That &s;he had but too much
Rea&s;on to believe, &s;he was <HI>bewitched,</HI> ha|ving many
<HI>&s;trange</HI> and <HI>wicked Thoughts</HI> run|ning ever Day in her Head,
about Things &s;he had never been troubled with, (till that unfortunate Leaf
fell in her way) &s;ince &s;he was a <HI>Maid,</HI> or but little better.</P>
<P> I COULD not re&s;i&s;t the Temptation, which the&s;e &s;illy
Stories left me under, of making a <HI>Vi&s;it</HI> to the formidable
<HI>Gooddy Hubbard</HI>; whom I found, in a little Hovel, which the Charity of
the Lord of the Manor had or|dered to be built for her, in the Wood; be|cau&s;e
the hone&s;t People of the Village, ha|ving taken it into their Heads to make a
<HI>Witch</HI> of the poor old Woman, fell upon her, as often as &s;he came in
their Way: And had two or three times endangered her Life, by &s;cratching her
with their Nails, till every Body had <HI>fetch'd Blood</HI> of her, (as the
Phra&s;e is) after which, it &s;eems, no <HI>Witch,</HI> in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
has Power to hurt a Hair of any Per&s;on's Head, who takes this effectual Way
to <HI>di&s;arm</HI> her,</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="389"> I CAME off, with no other Damage, than
the Lo&s;s of all the Money I had in my Pocket; which the Influence of
downright Compa&s;&s;ion compelled me to leave behind, for the Comfort of an
afflicted Creature, who&s;e un&s;upported Age, and Wretched|ne&s;s, in&s;tead
of the <HI>Relief</HI> or <HI>Pity,</HI> which was due to them by
<HI>Nature,</HI> had procur'd her the malicious Rage, and Per&s;ecution, of
<HI>unthinking Ignorance!</HI>&mdash;I return'd to my <HI>Widow</HI>; and after
a long and ple&s;ant Con|ver&s;ation, on the Subject of <HI>Witchcraft,</HI>
agreed heartily with her, That there were <HI>&s;uch Things as Witches</HI>;
and took upon me to a&s;&s;ure, with a <HI>Sigh,</HI> and a <HI>downca&s;t
Eye,</HI> That I had, <HI>my &s;elf,</HI> &s;uffer'd, &s;o &s;everely, by one

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> CASTING my Eye upon <HI>Horace,</HI> I found this excellent
Piece of Advice, <HI>Leges &amp; Per&s;crutabere Doctos.</HI> As I gene|rally
put in Practice what I read, in Pur&s;u|ance to his Advice, I &s;ent for a Set
of your Papers, and am now carefully peru&s;ing <PB N="389" REF="390"> them. I
take the &s;ame Method that Law|yers generally do with their <HI>Reports,</HI>
read the Modern Ca&s;es fir&s;t, &s;o go upward, till they come to the
Fountain-Head. But, when I light upon &s;ome of your <HI>Female</HI>
Cor|re&s;pondents, it puts me in Mind of the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Ladies, of old;
they re&s;emble them &s;o much in <HI>Spirit,</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI>
that I verily believe, many of their <HI>Great Great Grand|mothers</HI> lye
buried in the <HI>Campus Martius,</HI> or the <HI>Capitol.</HI> 'Tis not
incredible, That, af|ter <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> had fir&s;t enter'd
<HI>Britain,</HI> &s;ome of their <HI>Legionary Ladies,</HI> upon the Fame of
the <HI>Britons</HI> unwearied Courage, might make a &s;econd <HI>Roman
Inva&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>with as good Succe&s;s as</HI> Cae&s;ar, after
<HI>he</HI> had opened a Pa&s;&s;age for them.</P>
<P> <HI>LIVY,</HI> &s;ome where, tells us, That when the old
Gentlemen of <HI>Rome</HI> were contri|ving a Scheme to have more of their
La|dies good Company at home, the <HI>Women ro&s;e up in Arms,</HI> to the
great Surprize of the <HI>Roman</HI> State; That they denied the
<HI>Senators</HI> a free Pa&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e: And, that <HI>Cato</HI> by
Name, had like to have been <HI>carried off</HI> by the <HI>Mob.</HI> They
claimed, as their ancient <HI>Rights,</HI> and undoubted <HI>Pri|vileges,</HI>
almo&s;t as &s;trange Things, as your <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> does, in her late
Scheme for e&s;ta|bli&s;hing a <HI>Female Parliament.</HI> However, upon a
<HI>Parly</HI> between both Parties, the <HI>Women</HI> &s;ubmitted the Ca&s;e
to the <HI>Senate:</HI> Where, they always carried the <HI>Majority,</HI>
though 'tis well known, no Lady &s;ate in <PB N="390" REF="391">
<HI>Hou&s;e.</HI> Nor was that at all &s;urprizing: For if we examine
Hi&s;tory, I believe, we &s;hall find, the <HI>Senate,</HI> at that Time,
con|&s;i&s;ted more of <HI>Wits,</HI> than of <HI>Wi&s;e Men</HI>; over whom,
for the &s;ake of <HI>Politene&s;s,</HI> the <HI>Women</HI> mu&s;t have mo&s;t
Influence; nor is it le&s;s probable, that their being in Arms might
<HI>frighten</HI> the <HI>old</HI> Gentlemen.</P>
<P> THE U&s;e of <HI>Bribery</HI> likewi&s;e, had then newly been
found out; and, I dare &s;ay, there was no Lady, who had not about her,
<HI>wherewithal</HI> to <HI>purcha&s;e a Vote.</HI> Such was the Courage of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Ladies of old: And how exactly our <HI>Moderns</HI> imitate
them, is, I believe, too plain to need de|&s;cribing: Happy, therefore it is,
and much for the <HI>Peace of Great Britain,</HI> that our Parliament has never
attempted the Mo|deration of their exorbitant <HI>Hoops,</HI> or the
Abridgement of their <HI>Pin-Money!</HI> For my Part I mu&s;t frankly
confe&s;s, I have no Ob|jection to make again&s;t Mrs. <HI>Patty Amble</HI>'s
Propo&s;al. Other Men may have their <HI>Fears,</HI> from the &s;uppo&s;ed
<HI>Con&s;equences</HI> of a <HI>Female Parliament</HI>: But, I think, they are
<HI>out</HI> in their <HI>Politicks.</HI>&mdash;If a Power grows always

<P>I FELL lately into Company with a Cla&s;s of young Poets, who
affect to be Admir|ers of <HI>Ta&s;&s;o,</HI> and were Extravagant in their
Prai&s;e of a <HI>Simile,</HI> in his <HI>Gieru&s;alemme,</HI> where the
<HI>Devil,</HI> maligning the Succe&s;s of the <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI> Arms, is
&s;aid, To <HI>bite his Lips, and &s;purn up the Floor of Hell, in bellowing
Rage, like a wild Bull, when the Dogs are baiting him.</HI></P>
<P>THEY made me promi&s;e, That I would give them my impartial
Opinion; and, be|cau&s;e they earne&s;tly pre&s;s to know it, I will borrow the
Reflections of a Friend, on the Subject of <HI>Similes, in general</HI>; which
contain whatever I would &s;ay, were I to &s;peak con|cerning the Nature of
this great Ornament to Poetry; than which there is nothing more capable of
being made either <HI>delightful</HI> or <HI>ridiculous,</HI> according as it
is u&s;ed, di&s;creetly, or at random.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="393">THE U&s;e, which a Poet ought to make of
<HI>Compari&s;ons,</HI> is to <HI>illu&s;trate</HI> the Object re|pre&s;ented;
that is, to enlighten and enlarge the Apprehen&s;ion of the Reader. The Na|ture
therefore, of the Thing, which is <HI>com|pared,</HI> mu&s;t corre&s;pond
exactly with what it is <HI>compared to:</HI> There mu&s;t not only be an
ap|parent <HI>Re&s;emblance,</HI> but a vi&s;ible <HI>Proportion.</HI> A Thing
<HI>low,</HI> and <HI>incon&s;iderable,</HI> may be <HI>like</HI> enough to
&s;omething <HI>great,</HI> and <HI>magnificent</HI>; but then, wanting Dignity
to appear in its Company, no Poet of Judgment &s;hould &s;ub|mit to make U&s;e
of it.&mdash;I will give the Reader an In&s;tance of a very remarkable Fault of
this Kind;&mdash;Sir <HI>Richard Black|more,</HI> in his <HI>Prince
Arthur,</HI> has been plea&s;ed to compare the Devil, looking down from a
Mountain, on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Camp, to a <HI>Toad,</HI> on the Border of
a Walk looking up at the Gardener.</P>
<Q> 
<L>While, with malignant Eyes, th' Apo&s;tate view'd</L> 
<L>Their Ho&s;t, with <HI>Octa</HI>'s Me&s;&s;age pleas'd, he
&s;tood,</L> 
<L>Stung deep with Malice, and with Envy torn,</L> 
<L>While all his <HI>Veins,</HI> like <HI>Aetna</HI>'s Furnace,
burn.</L></Q>
<P>THE <HI>Veins</HI> of the Devil, I &s;uppo&s;e, were not &s;o much
owing to Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s Forget|fulne&s;s, that he was de&s;cribing a
<HI>Spirit</HI>; as to a politick De&s;ign of reducing <HI>Satan</HI> to
downright <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> and <HI>Blood,</HI> that the Reader, conceiving a
more humble Opinion of him, than he had been taught in his In|fancy, 
<PB N="393" REF="394"> might be the better prepar'd for the <HI>Toad</HI> in
the Compari&s;on.</P>
<Q> 
<L>And Streams of Fire, from his red Eye-balls flow'd,</L> 
<L>Like Light'ning, breaking from a low'ring Cloud:</L> 
<L>As when a <HI>Toad,</HI> &s;quat on a Border, &s;pies</L> 
<L>The Gard'ner pa&s;&s;ing by, his Blood&s;hot Eyes,</L> 
<L>With Spite, and Rage inflam'd, dart Fire around</L> 
<L>The verdant Walks, and on the flow'ry Ground,</L> 
<L>The bloated Vermin loath&s;ome Poi&s;on &s;pits,</L> 
<L>And &s;woln, and bur&s;ting with his Hatred, &s;its:</L> 
<L><HI>So</HI> the <HI>fall'n Angel,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P><HI>FALLEN</HI> indeed, if no abler to do Harm to Sir
<HI>Richard</HI>'s Hero, than his <HI>Toad</HI> to the Gardener! Where is the
terrible <HI>Power,</HI> the wily re&s;tle&s;s <HI>Malice,</HI> the in&s;atiate
revengeful <HI>Application,</HI> of this dangerous Enemy to Mankind, in Sir
<HI>Richard</HI>'s <HI>humble Simile?</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Toad</HI> may be <HI>poi&s;onous,</HI> but then he may be
<HI>trod upon,</HI> which is by no Means, the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Devil.</HI> If
a Poet, who introdu|ces <HI>Satan,</HI> thus <HI>inraged,</HI> would imagine a
Compari&s;on, to aggrandize the Horror of his Reader's Conception, it mu&s;t
certainly ari&s;e from nothing, which we are to look <HI>down</HI> upon; no
little, venomous, incon&s;iderable Creature; The Elements &s;hould War
toge|ther, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, as the&s;e; the Skies &s;hould blaze with
Lightning; the World reel with Earthquakes; the Sea ri&s;e to Hea|ven; the
Poles crack with Thunder; and <PB N="394" REF="395"> all <HI>Nature</HI> groan,
with Variety of Convul|&s;ions.&mdash;<HI>Toad, Poi&s;on, Squat, Bloated,
Spits, Vermin, Loath&s;ome, Swoln, Bur&s;ting!</HI> What Image can ari&s;e from
&s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e, which is either <HI>like,</HI> or
<HI>agreeable?</HI></P>
<P>TO &s;ay Truth, no <HI>Simile</HI> at all &s;hould have been
introduced in the Place I have been complaining again&s;t: The natural
Concep|tion of a Reader, can repre&s;ent to his <HI>Fancy</HI> the Idea of the
Devil, looking angry from a Mountain, much better, than any common Image, of
Things known, can repre&s;ent it to his <HI>Memory.</HI> A Compari&s;on is
never to be made, but where the Object to be de&s;cribed is le&s;s known, or
le&s;s conceivable, than &s;ome|thing el&s;e, which, being of equal Grandeur
and Importance, will al&s;o illu&s;trate, and rivet it on the
Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>THE De&s;criptions, and Similes, which we meet with in
<HI>Milton,</HI> give us quite other Ideas of this dreadful Rebel-Angel.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Scarce had he ceas'd, when the &s;uperior Fiend</L> 
<L>Was moving tow'rd the Shore; his pondrous Shield</L> 
<L>Behind him ca&s;t, the broad Circumference</L> 
<L>Hung on his Shoulders, like the <HI>Moon,</HI>
&amp;c.&mdash;</L> 
<L>His Spear, to equal which, the talle&s;t Pine,</L> 
<L>Hewn on <HI>Norwegian</HI> Hills, to be the Ma&s;t</L> 
<L>Of &s;ome great Admiral, were but a <HI>Wand</HI></L> 
<L>He walk'd with, to &s;upport unea&s;y Steps</L> 
<L>Over the burning Marl.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="395" REF="396">Again, 
<Q> 
<L>Forth came in Order the infernal Peers,</L> 
<L>'Mid&s;t them their <HI>mighty Paramount,</HI> who
&s;eem'd</L> 
<L><HI>Alone,</HI> th' Antagoni&s;t of Heaven! nor

<L>Than Hell's dread Emperor! with Pomp &s;upreme,</L>

<L>A Globe of fiery <HI>Seraphim</HI> inclo&s;ed.</L></Q></P>
<P>And again, 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;<HI>Satan,</HI> above the Re&s;t,</L> 
<L>In Shape, and Ge&s;ture, proudly <HI>eminent!</HI></L>

<L><HI>Care,</HI> on his faded Cheeks &s;at, under Brows</L> 
<L>Of dauntle&s;s Courage, and con&s;iderate Pride.</L></Q></P>
<P>HAVING named Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> I am well enough aware, That Sir
<HI>Richard</HI> may endea|vour a Ju&s;tification from <HI>that</HI> great
Poet's Example; who has made U&s;e, in another Place, of this very Simile of a
<HI>Toad,</HI> when <HI>he al&s;o</HI> is de&s;cribing <HI>Satan</HI>; but,
pray, ob|&s;erve with what Difference, as well in the Occa&s;ion, as the
Conduct.</P>
<P><HI>SATAN,</HI> after having changed him&s;elf into many different
Shapes, to avoid a Di&s;co|very, by tho&s;e Angelick Guards, which were 
<PB N="396" REF="397"> plac'd about Paradi&s;e, is met with, at la&s;t, by one
of the Parties.</P>
<Q> 
<L>So &s;aying, on he led his radiant Files,</L> 
<L>Dazling the Moon; The&s;e to the Bower direct,</L> 
<L>In Search of whom they &s;ought. Him there they found,</L> 
<L><HI>Squat,</HI> like a <HI>Toad,</HI> clo&s;e at the
<HI>Ear</HI> of <HI>Eve.</HI></L></Q>
<P>BESIDES his Nece&s;&s;ity of providing again&s;t
<HI>Di&s;covery,</HI> (of which he was in no Danger in Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s
Poem) he takes the Shape of a <HI>Toad,</HI> as mo&s;t proper, while
<HI>Eve</HI> was a&s;leep, to approach her clo&s;ely, concealed among the
Flowers, and &s;weet Herbs, on which &s;he lay.</P>
<Q> 
<L>A&s;&s;aying, by his Devili&s;h Art, to reach</L> 
<L>The Organs of her Fancy; <HI>there to forge</HI></L> 
<L>Illu&s;ions, as he li&s;ts.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>OBSERVE here, that the Devil is in no <HI>Rage,</HI> when thus
compared; but, on the contrary, under much <HI>Terror,</HI> and endeavour|ing
to <HI>deceive</HI> and <HI>circumvent,</HI> and therefore obliged in Policy,
to a&s;&s;ume that Form, which was rather &s;uitable to his <HI>End,</HI> than
an&s;werable to his <HI>Power.</HI> But, when he appears in his <HI>proper
Likene&s;s,</HI> the very Angels are repre&s;ented, as terrified, and
&s;tart|ing back, with Amazement.</P>
<Q><PB N="397" REF="398"> 
<L>Him, thus intent, <HI>Ithuriel,</HI> with his Spear,</L> 
<L>Touch'd lightly, for no Fal&s;ehood can endure</L> 
<L>Touch of Cele&s;tial Temper, but returns</L> 
<L>Perforce to its own Likene&s;s&mdash;Up he &s;tarts,</L> 
<L>Di&s;cover'd, and &s;urpriz'd! As when a Spark</L> 
<L>Lights on a <HI>nitrous Heap,</HI> the &s;mutty Grain,</L> 
<L>With &s;udden Blaze diffus'd, <HI>inflames</HI> the
<HI>Air:</HI></L> 
<L>So &s;tarted up, in his own Shape, the <HI>Fiend;</HI></L> 
<L>Back &s;tept the Two fair Angels, half amaz'd,</L> 
<L>So &s;udden, to <HI>behold</HI> the <HI>gri&s;ly
King.</HI></L></Q>
<P>NOTHING of this is <HI>little,</HI> nothing
<HI>dimi|ni&s;hing:</HI> The whole is natural, terrible, ma|je&s;tick,
&s;urprizing, and becoming the Dignity of the Subject, it relates to.</P>
<P>A <HI>Simile,</HI> &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be <HI>alike,</HI>
in all its Parts; It is enough, that &s;ome <HI>one</HI> Quality of the
Compari&s;on re&s;emble &s;ome <HI>one</HI> Part, or Nature of the Object it is
compared to.&mdash;<HI>Homer</HI> has been infinitely guilty of this Error;
hurried, as it were, away with the Ra|pidity of his Imagination, he &s;eldom
&s;taid to weigh any more of a Simile, than that very Part of it, which
&s;uited his Purpo&s;e; not mindful enough, that upon &s;tarting an Ob|ject, to
which many Qualities are common, the Apprehen&s;ion of the Reader, is not,
per|haps, at Lei&s;ure to examine which <HI>particular</HI> Quality includes
the <HI>Re&s;emblance,</HI> and there|fore di&s;cerns not any Likene&s;s at
all, but with &s;uch Trouble, and Application, as totally de&s;troy the very
End of a <HI>Simile.</HI> For if the <PB N="398" REF="399"> De&s;ign of this
Ornament be to <HI>illu&s;trate</HI> a <HI>De|&s;cription,</HI> it ought not
certainly to be found <HI>ob&s;cure</HI> in <HI>it&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is, in the noble <HI>Greek</HI> Poet above|mentioned, a
famous Compari&s;on of <HI>Ajax,</HI> who retreats &s;low, from an overpowering
Crowd of <HI>Trojans</HI>; to an <HI>A&s;s</HI> in an <HI>Enclo&s;ure,</HI>
&s;urrounded and beaten by the Sticks of the Village, but walking gravely,
notwith&s;tan|ding, toward the Gap, he came in at, and &s;topping very
frequently, to <HI>eat,</HI> in his Way: Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dacier, Bo&s;&s;u,</HI>
and all the <HI>French</HI> Criticks, who are not Converts to Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Perault</HI>'s Ob&s;ervations, have taken a great deal of Pains to
ju&s;tify this Simile of <HI>Homer</HI>'s; But, in my Opinion, they are all
mi&s;taken, not only in the <HI>Defence,</HI> but in the very
<HI>Ac|cu&s;ation:</HI> It is not &s;o much the <HI>A&s;s,</HI> that
de|&s;erves Blame, &s;ince he was in tho&s;e Days a <HI>Bea&s;t</HI> of Great
<HI>Quality:</HI> It is rather, that the Re&s;em|blance is <HI>partial,</HI>
where it ought to have been <HI>total.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>&s;tiff, reluctant,
Receding</HI> of <HI>Ajax</HI> from his Enemies, is certainly well hit, in the
Ob|&s;tinacy of the <HI>A&s;s</HI>; but where is that Part of the Compari&s;on,
which &s;hould enliven to our Imaginations, his frequent Return to Slaugh|ter?
His Impatience of Soul? That Fierce|ne&s;s, Indignation, and revengeful
Intrepidity, which the Poet's <HI>De&s;cription</HI> had al&s;o prepa|red us to
expect in his <HI>Simile?</HI> The <HI>A&s;s,</HI> with|out doubt, was <HI>loth
to depart,</HI> as <HI>Ajax,</HI> but he was neither &s;o apt to be
<HI>angry,</HI> nor &s;o dangerous, if he became &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="400">COMPARISONS, to conclude this Reflection,
can never be proper in <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> or violent Emotions of Mind; The
Imagination is then too much tran&s;ported, and inflamed, to ca&s;t about for
<HI>cool Re&s;emblances.</HI> But in the Mouth of the Poet, that is to &s;ay,
in the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Narration,</HI> and not in the <HI>Speeches,</HI>
they are beautiful, and nece&s;&s;ary. They <HI>de&s;cribe</HI> Pa&s;&s;ion
well, though they do not <HI>expre&s;s</HI> it: And, to &s;ay all in a Word,
Where <HI>De&s;crip|tion alone</HI> appears too weak to imprint an Idea on the
Mind of a Reader, there the only effectual Remedy is to have Recour&s;e to a
<HI>Simile.</HI></P>

<P> I AM led, (ob&s;erves this charming Cor|re&s;pondent) to

your Sentiments &s;eem finely turn'd for it.&mdash;<HI>Mine</HI> too, as far as

the other Day, in a Vi&s;it, which I made to a young Lady, a dear and intimate

<P> SHE retir'd from me, not long &s;ince, to indulge a &s;ilent
Grief, which I, and every Body, had taken Notice of, but which &s;he had
endeavour'd to conceal from her Ac|quaintance, with a Care, as earne&s;t, as it
was vain. For her Eyes, and alter'd Com|plexion, made it evident to all, who
loved her, and therefore delighted to look on her, that there was &s;omething
at her Heart, too melancholy for <HI>Solitude,</HI> and yet too
<HI>engag'd</HI> for <HI>Society.</HI></P>
<P> THE Privilege of our Intimacy intro|duced me to her Chamber,
without No|tice, or Ceremony; where I found her, writing, and

<P> AT la&s;t, &s;he &s;aw <HI>me,</HI> and
<HI>trembled!</HI>&mdash;She ro&s;e, in Confu&s;ion, and came forward, to

<P> IT was the fatal Happine&s;s of being <HI>near you,</HI> that
di&s;cover'd to me the Beauties of his Mind,&mdash;His re&s;pectful

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> THERE are none of your E&s;&s;ays, which more intitle you to my
E&s;teem, than tho&s;e, which you have been in&s;pir'd with, by the mo&s;t
generous, and gentle, Pa&s;&s;ion, that acts on, and adorns Humanity.&mdash;I
need not tell you, after this, that the Pa&s;&s;ion, I mean, is LOVE.&mdash;You
have eonfe&s;s'd your&s;elf a <HI>Lover</HI>; and, if you <HI>had not,</HI> I
&s;hould have <HI>gue&s;s'd it,</HI> by the Warmth, and Spirit, of your
Sentiments, when you attempt any thing, on that Subject.&mdash;A
<HI>Warmth,</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> Mr. PLAIN DEALER, which agree &s;o ill,
with your <HI>Grand Climacte|rick,</HI> that (if it were not for the
<HI>implicite Reve|rence,</HI> with which I conclude my&s;elf
<HI>mi&s;taken,</HI> when you a&s;&s;ert, what I find <HI>difficult</HI> to
<HI>be|lieve</HI>) I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e your <HI>Age,</HI> as chime|rical, 
<PB N="417" REF="418"> as your <HI>Situation</HI>; and no more look for you,
among the <HI>Old,</HI> than upon the <HI>Watch-Tower</HI> of
<HI>Barbican.</HI></P>
<P> BUT, let <HI>that</HI> pa&s;s: No matter, whether you are
<HI>Old,</HI> or <HI>no,</HI> &s;ince I will admit, that you are
<HI>Venerable.</HI>&mdash;I reverence <HI>you,</HI> for that Reverence, with
which you &s;peak of <HI>Love,</HI> and the <HI>Ladies.</HI> The <HI>light
World,</HI> Mr. PLAIN DEALER, have no Ta&s;te for the refined Ideas, which
almo&s;t <HI>deify</HI> this &s;acred Pa&s;&s;ion. But, let me peri&s;h, if I
would exchange the <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of my <HI>Mi|&s;tre&s;s's Soul,</HI> for
the mo&s;t unbounded Pro|perty, in her <HI>angelick Body.</HI> The Ble&s;&s;ing
is <HI>fulle&s;t,</HI> I confe&s;s, when <HI>both</HI> the&s;e go
<HI>together:</HI> But the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> without the <HI>La&s;t,</HI> can
give me <HI>Tenderne&s;s, Endearment,</HI> and the Delight of &s;weet
<HI>Reflection</HI>; whereas the <HI>La&s;t,</HI> without the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI>
would (in &s;pite of all its Tran&s;ports) carry with it an un|&s;atisfying,
and reluctant, <HI>Void</HI> of <HI>Thought,</HI> which would rob it, of its
<HI>fine&s;t</HI> Reli&s;h: For who would <HI>dare</HI> to <HI>think,</HI> at
all, when (if he thinks) he mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that he is receiving, from
an <HI>uncon&s;enting Heart,</HI> the la&s;t, and deare&s;t,
<HI>Obligation,</HI> which can &s;pring from <HI>Love,</HI> and
<HI>Gratitude?</HI></P>
<P> THE <HI>Cold,</HI> and <HI>Grave,</HI> perhaps, may think, That
there is <HI>Levity</HI> in <HI>Loving,</HI> to &s;uch &s;weet Exce&s;s, as I
do: I, too, once, thought, as they think!&mdash;But Time, and the remember'd
Conver&s;e of a Wo|man, <HI>&s;ofter,</HI> than the <HI>Fir&s;t Idea's</HI> of
her <PB N="418" REF="419"> Sex's Innocence! and <HI>wi&s;er,</HI> and more
<HI>&s;olid,</HI> than their <HI>la&s;t Reflections,</HI> when they
<HI>leave</HI> a World that flatter'd them! have taught me, that there is no
Joy on Earth, &s;o <HI>real,</HI> and &s;o <HI>la&s;ting,</HI> as the Union of
a Soul, &s;o charm'd, as mine is, with the Soul, that has &s;o charm'd
it!&mdash;<HI>Ab&s;ence,</HI> Mr. PLAIN DEALER, and a Thou&s;and Ob&s;tacles, I
dare not name, have interpo&s;ed their cruel Influence: And I have, almo&s;t,
Cau&s;e to <HI>fear,</HI> my Tenderne&s;s, and Con&s;tancy, are
<HI>doubted,</HI> even by the lovely <HI>Object</HI> of them: And, yet, I never
pa&s;s a Moment, which takes not its <HI>Pain,</HI> or <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI>
chiefly, from the Part, <HI>Her</HI> ever-pre&s;ent Image bears, in the
Occa&s;ion. The Memory of <HI>Her</HI> dear Intere&s;t in me, gives
<HI>Spirit</HI> to my <HI>Hope, Mitigation</HI> to my <HI>Sorrow,</HI> and
<HI>Moderation</HI> to my <HI>Anger.</HI> If I <HI>fear,</HI> it is <HI>for
Her:</HI> And, if I <HI>wi&s;h,</HI> it is to <HI>make her
happy.</HI>&mdash;She <HI>alleviates</HI> all my <HI>Cares</HI>; and, yet,
&s;he <HI>quickens,</HI> and <HI>increa&s;es</HI> them! She is my
<HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> when I have <HI>Lei&s;ure,</HI> and my
<HI>Lei&s;ure,</HI> when I am in the mid&s;t of <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> She is
the <HI>Paradox,</HI> and <HI>Riddle,</HI> of my Life! I have the Mis|fortune
to live, <HI>ab&s;ent</HI> from her, yet is &s;he never <HI>out of my
Company!</HI> I am not&mdash;mu&s;t not&mdash;cannot be <HI>Her's</HI>; and
yet, <HI>am only Her's,</HI> for Ever!</P>
<P> I REMEMBER, when, I had the Ble&s;&s;ing of &s;eeing her
oft'ner, I once painted my Soul's full Meaning, in the following Copy of
Ver&s;es to her, or &s;omething, not much <PB N="419" REF="420"> unlike
them.&mdash;Be &s;o good, as to <HI>in&s;ert</HI> them; &s;he, &s;ometimes,
&s;ees your Paper, and they may awaken the Remembrance of a Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he,
perhaps, <HI>relaxes from.</HI>&mdash;I hope, Her Soul does Ju&s;tice to the
Impre&s;|&s;ion which <HI>mine</HI> glows with: But, let Her Thoughts of
<HI>Me,</HI> be <HI>kind,</HI> or <HI>le&s;s partial,</HI> than they <HI>have
been,</HI> I mu&s;t never expect the Power, which, I am &s;ure, I &s;hall never
<HI>wi&s;h for,</HI> of redeeming my&s;elf from that &s;weet Captivity, in
which Her Image holds the Heart of,</P>

<P>DESIGNING to be grave to Day, on the &s;ober Subject of
RESOLUTION, I will bribe my Reader's Attention, to a Di&s;cour&s;e, le&s;s
<HI>gay,</HI> than <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> by telling them a &s;hort <HI>Story,</HI>
in the very Front of my Paper.</P>
<Q> 
<P> <HI>SALADIN,</HI> the <HI>Soldan</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> tho' he
had Dominions enough, of his own, was always ready, when Occa&s;ion offered, to
<HI>make free</HI> with other People's.&mdash;At his Return without Succe&s;s,
from the Siege of <HI>Mo&s;oul,</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> he &s;eized into his
Hands the whole Lord&s;hip of <HI>Eme&s;&s;a,</HI> in Prejudice to the Right of
<HI>Na&s;ir Eddin,</HI> the young Prince, who clai|med it. And <HI>this</HI> he
did, upon Pretence, That the late <HI>Father</HI> of the Youth had
<HI>for|feited,</HI> by giving Countenance to Con&s;edera|cies again&s;t the
<HI>Soldan</HI>'s Intere&s;t.</P> 
<P> <HI>SALADIN,</HI> however, ordered, That proper Care &s;hould be
taken, of the injur'd Prince's Education: and being de&s;irous to ob|&s;erve, 
<PB N="424" REF="425"> what Progre&s;s he made in his Studies, he was brought,
one Day, before the <HI>Soldan</HI>; who asked him, with much Gravity, <HI>In
what Part of the Alcoran he was Reading?</HI>&mdash;I am come, reply'd the
young Prince (to the <HI>Surprize of all,</HI> who were near him) to that
Ver&s;e, which informs me, That <HI>He</HI> who <HI>de|vours</HI> the
<HI>E&s;tates</HI> of ORPHANS, is not a <HI>King,</HI> but a
<HI>Tyrant.</HI></P> 
<P> THE <HI>Soldan</HI> was much &s;tartled at the Turn, and Spirit,
of his <HI>Repartee</HI>; but, after &s;ome Pau&s;e, and Recollection, return'd
the Youth this generous An&s;wer.&mdash;He, who <HI>&s;peaks,</HI> with &s;uch
<HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> would <HI>act</HI> with &s;o much <HI>Courage,</HI> that
I <HI>re&s;tore</HI> you to your Father's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, le&s;t I
&s;hould be thought to &s;tand in <HI>Fear</HI> of a Virtue, which I only
<HI>reverence.</HI></P></Q>
<P>SUCH an Influence has <HI>Firmne&s;s,</HI> even in <HI>Words,</HI>
and <HI>Appearance!</HI> But, when reduced into <HI>Practice,</HI> it is
productive of <HI>innumerable Benefits:</HI> So that, were I to be asked by a
Man of Sen&s;e, <HI>Which would be his &s;horte&s;t Road, to Felicity</HI>; My
An&s;wer &s;hould be, The Path, which leads thro' <HI>Con&s;tancy</HI> and
<HI>Re&s;olution:</HI> No other <HI>Road,</HI> but this! and no other
<HI>Guide,</HI> than <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> can carry him <HI>through</HI> his
Journey, and bring him <HI>&s;afe</HI> to the <HI>End</HI> he aims at.</P>
<P>RESOLUTION in <HI>Life,</HI> is like <HI>Action</HI> in
<HI>Orato|ry</HI>; as <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> de&s;cribed it: It is the
<HI>Fir&s;t, Second,</HI> and <HI>Third</HI> Thing nece&s;&s;ary. The Soul is
endowed with Three powerful Faculties; <PB N="425" REF="426"> the
<HI>Under&s;tanding,</HI> the <HI>Memory,</HI> and the <HI>Will</HI>; but, with
regard to <HI>moral Life,</HI> they all Three lie <HI>dead,</HI> without the
Help of <HI>Re&s;olu|tion.</HI> Re&s;olution is their <HI>Parent,</HI> their
<HI>Mid|wife,</HI> and their <HI>Nur&s;e.</HI> It fir&s;t impregnates them with
<HI>Activity</HI>; then <HI>delivers</HI> them in their <HI>Labours</HI>; and
<HI>nouri&s;hes</HI> the Effects of tho&s;e Labours with
<HI>Per&s;everance.</HI> What im|ports it, to <HI>know</HI> either the
<HI>Good</HI> or the <HI>Pro|per,</HI> if we <HI>forget</HI> or
<HI>over-look</HI> that Know|ledge? Or, to what End do we <HI>remember,</HI>
what is Great, and Heroick in others, if <HI>Re|&s;olution</HI> does not
conform our Will to co-ope|rate with our Under&s;tanding!</P>
<P>RESOLUTION therefore is the &s;piritual Uni|on of the Mind's
be&s;t Faculties: and may, not improperly, be called the <HI>Soul</HI> of the
very <HI>Soul</HI> it&s;elf.&mdash;It exerci&s;es the Under&s;tanding into
<HI>Meditation</HI>; Meditation gives Life to Memory; and reduces <HI>Good
Will</HI> into Habit; and Habitual Good Will in&s;pires the Memo|ry and
Under&s;tanding to break beautifully forth, into a Series of <HI>good
Actions.</HI></P>
<P>FOR this Rea&s;on I have often reflected, that we &s;tand more in
Need of being <HI>remind|ed,</HI> than of being <HI>taught</HI>; and that,
whoever would lead Men to be <HI>good,</HI> that is, to be <HI>happy</HI>;
&s;hould rather in&s;pire them with Re&s;o|lution to <HI>do</HI> what they know
to be right, than to learn, <HI>what it is</HI> to do rightly. Mo|ral Arguments
&s;hould be chiefly applied to the <HI>Memory,</HI> and are <HI>Incentives</HI>
to the <HI>Will,</HI> rather than <HI>Aids</HI> to the
<HI>Under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="427">THIS is evident, methinks, from the
fol|lowing Con&s;iderations; <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> as it regards practical Life,
is no more than a Faculty of di&s;cerning what is Good, from what is Evil; what
is to be embraced, and what rejected.&mdash;Now if the wi&s;e&s;t Man upon
Earth, by the Dint only of <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> could bring him&s;elf to
<HI>practi&s;e,</HI> what a Man of the mo&s;t mode|rate Faculties
<HI>comprehends</HI> and <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hes,</HI> he would indeed, be a
<HI>wi&s;e Man,</HI> according to the genuine Signification. But, as the World

the Fault lies not in the <HI>Un|der&s;tanding,</HI> but the <HI>Will</HI>; nor
proceeds from Want of Knowledge, but Deficiency of Firm|ne&s;s, and
Re&s;olution. Mr. DRYDEN, &s;peak|ing of Men in their <HI>thinking</HI> and

<P>A LITTLE common Thief knows he <HI>&s;hould not</HI> commit

wan|ting <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> to be <HI>publickly needy,</HI> rather than
<HI>privately di&s;hone&s;t,</HI> he deviates from the <HI>real</HI> Good; and
ventures upon the <HI>appearing.</HI>&mdash;How often has the <HI>Judge</HI>

Faces, who <HI>accu&s;e Robbers</HI> at his Tribunal! He <HI>dares commit</HI>

<HI>Re&s;olution</HI> to de|&s;pi&s;e the Bribe, though he has not the Felon's
<HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> to plead in Excu&s;e of it: The poor Thief in this

This, every Spectator &s;ees <HI>through,</HI> and <HI>laughs</HI> at; and yet,

Heads forget</HI> them&s;elves, commanded this Ser|vant to wake him every

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> IT is with no &s;mall Expectation, that I ob&s;erve you, in
&s;ome of your Papers, making Excur&s;ions into the Province of
<HI>Critici&s;m:</HI> It is a Subject, not only <HI>Enter|taining,</HI> but
<HI>In&s;tructive:</HI> And there is no kind of Knowledge, in which tho&s;e gay
Spirits, who are loude&s;t, and mo&s;t ready, in giving Judgment, are &s;o
contemptibly and lamentably Deficient, as in the Art of <HI>Judg|ing
rightly.</HI></P>
<P> TWO Improvements might be hop'd for, in the Ta&s;te of mo&s;t
Readers, from a more general Propagation of the Knowledge of
<HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing clearly:</HI> We &s;hould neither be a&s;hamed to
prai&s;e the Merit of the Ob&s;cu|re&s;t <PB N="432" REF="433"> re&s;t of our
<HI>Cotemporaries</HI>; nor afraid to cen|&s;ure the Errors of the mo&s;t
Popular among <HI>ancient</HI> Writers.</P>
<P> <HI>HOMER</HI>'s famous Catalogue, of <HI>Gre|cian</HI> Ships,
and their Commanders, would, then, I am apt to believe, cea&s;e to pa&s;s for
one of his Sublime&s;t, and mo&s;t Poetical Beauties. Its Geographieal
Exactne&s;s would no longer be pleaded as a Ballance, again&s;t the Dryne&s;s,
and Tediou&s;ne&s;s, of its Hi&s;to|rical Enumeration: Since it is no Part of a
<HI>Poet's</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s, to teach the Situation, Bounds, and Quality, of
Countries. Little, occa&s;ional De&s;criptions of that kind, 'tis true, may
&s;ometimes, be nece&s;&s;ary; and, being artfully introduced, and handled,
might not only <HI>diver&s;ify</HI> a Poem; but al&s;o render it
<HI>delightful:</HI> Without which la&s;t Quality, the whole Labour is lo&s;t.
And nothing, certainly, can <HI>delight,</HI> that is <HI>tire|&s;om,</HI> and
<HI>heavy.</HI></P>
<P> BUT the Bigotry of a Succe&s;&s;ion of un|poetical
<HI>Commentators,</HI> Men of Learning, without Genius; has heap'd upon this
Ca|talogue, &s;uch profu&s;e and ill-judg'd <HI>Enco|mium,</HI> that the whole
Herd of Imitators, from the <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI>'s of <HI>Italy,</HI> down to the
<HI>Black|more</HI>'s of <HI>Britain,</HI> have lengthen'd out their ho&s;tile
<HI>Mu&s;ter-Rolls,</HI> to the Terror and Pro|vocation, even of the mo&s;t
patient of their gentle Readers. And &s;ome of the&s;e have been fortunate
enough to meet with Ap|plau&s;e, more extravagant, even than <HI>Ho|mer</HI>'s:
<PB N="433" REF="434"> For they have been compar'd with and <HI>preferr'd</HI>
to <HI>Homer</HI>'s. Witne&s;s <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI>'s commendatory
<HI>Vi&s;ion,</HI> printed be|fore the old Edition of DRAYTON<HI>'s</HI> Battle

<P><PB N="435" REF="436"> THIS, though a bald, and unlovely
Imi|tation of <HI>Homer,</HI> is better I think, in one Sen&s;e, than the

<P> SUCH a barren, and di&s;tinct Enumeration gives a weari&s;om

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Oh Dear! Mr. <HI>PLAIN DEALER,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> MANY a Lady has been charm'd into a Pa&s;&s;ion for her future
Lover, upon Sight only of his <HI>Picture:</HI> But my Fate is the very
Rever&s;e of This; For, be|fore I &s;aw the <HI>Picture</HI> of my
<HI>Florello,</HI> I was almo&s;t in Love with the <HI>Original:</HI> Where|as,
now, I am fallen ab&s;olutely in Love with the Picture, and can &s;carce bear
the Sight of That odious Lover of mine, who <HI>&s;at</HI> for it.</P>
<P> THE Picture, you mu&s;t know, is a Kind of Paradox: For it is
drawn but in <HI>Black,</HI> and <HI>White</HI>; and yet glows, with the
live|lie&s;t Force; and mo&s;t natural Mixture of &s;trong <HI>Colouring!</HI>
It is <HI>One,</HI> of a valuable <HI>Collection,</HI> which was expos'd to
Publick Sale la&s;t Week; under Title of <HI>The</HI> UNIVERSAL 
<PB N="439" REF="440"> PASSION, <HI>Part</HI> II.&mdash;Wou'd to Heaven I knew
the Painter! A Hand, &s;o exqui&s;ite at <HI>Touching,</HI> &s;hould <HI>take
me,</HI> as often as I cou'd po&s;&s;ibly &s;it to him. Nay, I wou'd &s;ooner
be drawn by <HI>Him,</HI> than by <HI>Apelles,</HI> or <HI>Ti|tian,</HI> or
<HI>Lilly,</HI> or <HI>Vandike</HI>; or by any Pen|cil ancient, or modern;
<HI>except that only,</HI> to which we owe &s;o many envy-rai&s;ing Pic|tures
of my Friend Mrs. <HI>Arabella Farmor.</HI></P>
<P> NOT but there is infinite Difference, be|tween the Two Pieces;
and the <HI>Lines,</HI> in|deed, are &s;trikingly di&s;tingui&s;h'd, in
both:&mdash;In the <HI>Lady</HI>'s, They are <HI>&s;weet, &s;oft,
de|licate!</HI> In my <HI>Florello</HI>'s, They are <HI>&s;trong, bold,
glaring! Florello</HI>'s very <HI>Life</HI> is not half &s;o <HI>lively,</HI>
as this fine Painter's <HI>&s;peaking Repre&s;entation</HI> of it.&mdash;See!
the <HI>Fi|gure,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit!</HI> the <HI>Grace!</HI> and
<HI>Pa&s;|&s;ion,</HI> of the Picture!</P>
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>OF late, at <HI>White</HI>'s, was young <HI>Florello</HI>
&s;een,</L>
<L>How <HI>blank</HI> his Look! how <HI>di&s;compos'd</HI> his
Mien!</L>
<L>(In <HI>Grief Sincere,</HI> &s;o hard it proves to
feign!)</L>
<L>Sunk were his Spirits! for his <HI>Coat</HI> was
<HI>plain.</HI></L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>NEXT Day, his Brea&s;t regain'd its wonted Peace,</L>
<L>His Health was mended with a <HI>Silver Lace!</HI></L>
<L>A curious Arti&s;t, long inur'd to Toils,</L>
<L>Of gentler &s;ort, with Combs, and fragrant Oils,</L>
<L>Whether by <HI>Chance,</HI> or by &s;ome <HI>God</HI>
in&s;pir'd,</L>
<L>So touch'd his <HI>Curls,</HI> his mighty <HI>Soul</HI> was
fir'd!</L>

<P> AS You are a Gentleman of Penetrati|on, and capable of rendring
every Thing that is offer'd to You in a brighter Capacity than I am, (which
occurr'd to me, upon reading your Paper of <HI>Friday, March</HI> the 12th, in

called a PARROT, in a Hou&s;e that is ju&s;t over again&s;t him) I I de&s;ire,
that in your next, you would only give Caution to a certain Lady, who&s;e
Lodgings are oppo&s;ite to mine, That &s;he does not indulge PUGG, as I have
&s;een her, in all that provoking and unmerited Free|dom, of <HI>pawing</HI>
her upon the <HI>Mouth</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;om.</HI> Fle&s;h, and Blood, Mr. PLAIN

of <HI>Man</HI> to <HI>Dogs,</HI> I am &s;ure it is much le&s;s lawful to
be&s;tow His Right upon an <HI>ugly Monkey.</HI>&mdash;In &s;hort, I am out of
all manner of <HI>Patience</HI>; and if this Lady will not be &s;o kind as to
keep my Rival out of my Sight, I mu&s;t be forc'd to <HI>brick up my
Windows,</HI> or remove to a <HI>new Lodging:</HI> For I wou'd not, methinks,
be &s;o unrea&s;onable, as to quarrel with PUGG <HI>Him&s;elf</HI> about it:
Since, He looks (to con|fe&s;s the Truth) as if He was <HI>born</HI> to be the

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> YOU will much oblige one of your con&s;tant Readers, and very
great Ad|mirers; if you will but an&s;wer me this Quere, <HI>viz.</HI> In your
Excellent PLAIN DEALER, of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 24th, 1724, N^o 45, treating
of <HI>Love,</HI> wherein is contain'd, part of that lovely POEM on the &s;ame

<Q> 
<L>Ab&s;ent from <HI>Her,</HI> in whom alone we

<L>Friends are <HI>IMPORTUNATE,</HI> and Plea&s;ures
<HI>lo&s;t,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P> NOW all the Que&s;tion is, Whether that is not a Mi&s;take of
the Printer's; putting <HI>Importunate</HI> for <HI>Impertinent?</HI> or,
Whether I, in Ju&s;tice to you, for giving this Trouble, &s;hou'd not write

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I HAVE perceived, quite through the Cour&s;e of your Papers,
that your Ten|dency, is not only to <HI>Delight</HI> your Read|ers; but to
<HI>Inform,</HI> and <HI>Refine</HI> them. Up|on this Con&s;ideration, I mu&s;t
per&s;uade my|&s;elf, you will &s;et the following Subject in the &s;tronge&s;t
Light; which, the more ef|fectually to recommend it to you, I a&s;&s;ure you it
is not fictitious, but real Matter of Fact.&mdash;There is a certain Widow, who
has two Sons, and two Daughters, the for|mer of which, are arrived to the
State, which writes them <HI>Men,</HI> both brought up to creditable
Employments; but neither of them capable of proceeding in their Bu&s;ine&s;s,
without her A&s;&s;i&s;tance; which, tho' very able to give, &s;he
<HI>refu&s;es</HI> them.</P>
<P> YOU will be more than a little &s;urprized, when I tell you,
there is a Per&s;on, beyond De&s;cription, ru&s;tical, and unlovely, who 
<PB N="444" REF="445"> makes his aukward Addre&s;&s;es to the <HI>Wealth</HI>
of this Widow: And that this is the <HI>Con|&s;ideration</HI> which &s;he
prefers to the Welfare of her Children, who have urg'd her, on their Knees, to
regard, not only <HI>Their Good,</HI> but what the World will &s;ay of
<HI>her&s;elf.</HI>&mdash;Deaf to all their Interce&s;&s;ions, &s;he
continu|ally repul&s;es them, and is unalterably de|termined, on her
<HI>own</HI> and <HI>their</HI> Ruin.</P>
<P> NOW, I would beg of you, to tell me, What Motive can induce her
to this? And to account for it in a <HI>Phy&s;ical</HI> Manner? Should not the
moving Wants and Depen|dance of her own Children, prevail more upon her
<HI>Nature,</HI> than the intere&s;ted Ad|dre&s;&s;es of a <HI>Stranger</HI>?
For I am afraid, there are no Incentives to <HI>Love,</HI> on either Side, and
I am loth to give it its <HI>other Name.</HI> If, Sir, you in&s;ert this as
&s;oon as you can in your Paper, you may do a real Good, and at the &s;ame Time
you will oblige one of your con&s;tanr Readers.</P>

<P> THE a&s;toni&s;hing Structure, the im|men&s;e, but beautiful,
Extent, and Order of <HI>Creation,</HI> demand, not the <HI>Notice</HI> only,
but, the <HI>Veneration</HI> of every rea&s;o|nable Being. No le&s;s than
<HI>infinite Wi&s;dom</HI> could conceive the Plan; nor le&s;s than
<HI>Al|mighty Power</HI> erect the Fabrick! Our Sight is &s;truck with
Amazement, when we look but upon a &s;tately Building, the mere Ef|fect of
Human Invention; And, yet, (to the Shame of our Stupidity be it &s;poken) we
can con&s;ider the <HI>Earth,</HI> we live on, with
<HI>Indifference</HI>;&mdash;we can walk under the <HI>Lamps</HI> of
<HI>Heaven,</HI> without being inlightened by the &s;malle&s;t Glimmering of
Divine Re|flection! nor (to many) do they argue any <PB N="447" REF="448">
thing greater than <HI>Chance,</HI> which, in other Words, is
<HI>Nothing.</HI></P>
<P> YET, certainly, no Knowledge can be &s;o <HI>delightful,</HI>
to the Soul, as <HI>This,</HI> which is, at the &s;ame Time, the
<HI>noble&s;t,</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> that can bu&s;y us, in our

Bu&s;ine&s;s and Employment, to all Eternity, to di&s;|cover &s;till, deeper
and deeper, into the un|fathomable Works of God; and contem|plate the Glory of
his Wi&s;dom, Power, and Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P> I AM &s;en&s;ible, You concur with me, that the <HI>Honour</HI>
due to <HI>God,</HI> &s;hould excite the noble&s;t of our Thoughts, and

been made known to us. New Kingdoms of Animals; new Architecture, and
Cu|rio&s;ity of Workman&s;hip, and Oeconomy. So that as, <HI>before,</HI> our
Conception fainted, in tho&s;e boundle&s;s Journeys we were obliged to take
through the expan&s;ive Va&s;tne&s;s of the Univer&s;e; here, on the other

and con|&s;tituent Parts of it. Both the <HI>Beginnings</HI> and the
<HI>End</HI> of Things, the <HI>Lea&s;t</HI> and the <HI>Greate&s;t,</HI> all
con&s;pire to perplex us: And which every way we pro&s;ecute our In|quiries, we
&s;till fall in with fre&s;h Subjects of Amazement, and fre&s;h Rea&s;ons to
be|lieve, that there are more and more be|hind, that will for ever e&s;cape our

<P>I AM, though a great Lover of <HI>Trade,</HI> a declar'd Enemy to
the Company of <HI>Vintners</HI>; and profe&s;s, That my Indignation daily
ri&s;es again&s;t them more and more, in proportion as they daily deviate from
their fir&s;t laudable In&s;titution. Taverns were in|tended, at their
primitive Erection, as pub|lick <HI>Refectories,</HI> where Men, who&s;e
Bu&s;ine&s;s called them Abroad from their Families, and &s;ingle Gentlemen,
who had no Familes at all, might re&s;ort for a chearful and nece&s;&s;ary
Refre&s;hment. So that <HI>Taverns</HI> &s;tood in this Town for much the

<P><PB N="453" REF="460">I WAS led into this Subject, on the Eve of a
late drunken Holiday, when, returning Home in a melancholy Di&s;po&s;ition, at
a later Hour than u&s;ual, I was unexpectedly &s;aluted with an unlucky Piece
of News, that a Kin&s;|man, who, notwith&s;tanding all that a famous
Predece&s;&s;or of mine had wittily remark'd, in Ridicule of that &s;illy
Practice, wou'd try to drive to him&s;elf Home on the <HI>Coach-box</HI>; when
he was &s;carce able to get into the <HI>Coach,</HI> without the Help of its

thrown almo&s;t out of the World: And ju&s;t as I was plung'd into a profound
Meditation on this ill Accident, Word was brought me, That <HI>Literatus</HI>
and <HI>Urbanus,</HI> two Bo&s;om Intimates, having drank toge|ther, to
Exce&s;s, the latter lo&s;t his <HI>Civility,</HI> and the former his

behind, to imbitter his &s;urviving Days with a <HI>Remor&s;e,</HI> which the
other's <HI>Death</HI> was pre|&s;erable to.&mdash;I was lo&s;t in the
&s;tartling Thought, how dreadful it mu&s;t be, to drop out of a
<HI>Temporary</HI> into an <HI>Eternal</HI> Exi&s;tence, in &s;o deplorable,
and unprepar'd a State! which brought immediately to my Remem|brance, what the

<P>THIS &s;en&s;ible and moving Complaint, &s;o awfully placed in the
Mouth of a <HI>Gho&s;t,</HI> &s;trikes a con&s;iderate Auditor with Terror, and
leaves him <HI>warn'd</HI> and <HI>a&s;toni&s;h'd:</HI> But, there is a Scene
in a Comedy, call'd <HI>The Ly|ing Lovers,</HI> That comes more immediately to
this Subject, of a Gentleman's Stabbing his Friend in the Fury of his
Drunkenne&s;s; and which, if it had been read or heard with At|tention, by
<HI>Urbanus,</HI> would probably have prevented his own becoming a too real
Ex|ample of <HI>this unhappy Truth,</HI> That a Man, who in the pre&s;ent
Moment, is Ma&s;ter of the &s;tronge&s;t Rea&s;on, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the
greate&s;t Honour, and adorn'd with the fine&s;t Senti|ments of Religion,
Friend&s;hip and Huma|nity, may, in two or three Hours <HI>drinking,</HI> be
pu&s;h'd forward, by the Rage of Wine, to act unheard-of <HI>Brutalities,</HI>
in direct Oppo&s;i|tion to the Impul&s;e of all its Virtues. I re|commend this
u&s;eful Scene to the Peru&s;al of tho&s;e indanger'd Adventurers, who are apt
to be quarrel&s;ome in their Cups, and yet dare ra&s;hly addict them&s;elves to
an habitual In|temperance.</P>
<P><PB N="454" REF="462">THE Fatigue of &s;o melancholy a
Medita|tion, ca&s;t me into a di&s;order'd kind of Sleep, in which it
furni&s;hed me (as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;ays) with <HI>the Stuff of which
Dreams are made.</HI> My Imagination, working bu&s;ily upon the Tra|ces of my
waking Thoughts, brought me into the Company of a Hoary and Venera|ble Matron,
who&s;e Eyes were &s;o <HI>piercing bright,</HI> that they &s;eem'd to have
increas'd by Age, their Faculty of Penetration. She told me, That her Name was
CAUTION, and bid|ding me follow her, &s;he conducted me, as the Prophete&s;s
did <HI>Aeneas,</HI> into one of the Regions of the <HI>nether World,</HI>
where the Shades of all tho&s;e, who depart this Life, in the Guilt of their
Debauches, are doom'd to in|habit.</P>
<P>I FOUND my &s;elf, without being able to de&s;cribe the Method of
my &s;peedy Convey|ance thither, in a va&s;t Place like an I&s;land,
incompa&s;s'd with a Moat of Liquid Fire, where different Crowds of People,
were un|der the Torment of being <HI>forced</HI> to <HI>drink,</HI> every
Moment, till they were deprived of their Sen&s;es, and betrayed into
Extravagan|cies, which never failed to fill their Hearts with Pain and
Remor&s;e, for &s;ome enormous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion or other, committed by them
when &s;o di&s;order'd.&mdash;Then the Fury that ad|mini&s;ter'd the Liquor,
had a Power of reco|vering them, by repre&s;enting their pa&s;t Acti|ons, in a
Gla&s;s, that &s;erv'd them in&s;tead of <HI>Memory.</HI>&mdash;When they had
&s;uffer'd the full <PB N="456" REF="463"> Pangs of Sobriety, and pain'd their
Ob&s;erva|tion with what they <HI>might</HI> have been, and what they
<HI>were</HI>; the Fury drench'd them a|fre&s;h, with the Intoxicating Tide of
Torture; and this was the Repetition of a Life, who&s;e Circle compos'd a Round
of Mi&s;ery, that never was to know an End. Each Crowd was thus attended, by
&s;ome Deputy of in|fernal Vengeance,</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t, I took Notice of, was a Com|pany of Gentlemen, who,
before they began to drink, were of robu&s;t Make of Body; they had Sanguine
Complexions, and carried <HI>Health</HI> in their whole Appearance: Before
the&s;e, a <HI>Devil,</HI> in the Dre&s;s of a <HI>Drawer,</HI> had placed a
va&s;t Barrel of Liquor, of which when each had got his Do&s;e, the Effects of
the Poi&s;on began to work differently upon the&s;e poor Patients, that
&s;eem'd lately in a State &s;o florid. Some, that were of the mo&s;t gigantick
Size, like <HI>Father Dominick</HI> in the <HI>Spani&s;h Fryer,</HI> &s;unk two
Yards and a Half in the <HI>Wetting.</HI> Others again, who were <HI>thin</HI>
Men, were bloated by Drop&s;ies, into the Dimen&s;ions which the former had
&s;hrunk from.&mdash;They, who ju&s;t before, had Vigour enough to out-voice
their own Hunt|ing-Horns, were, by a Do&s;e or two of that &s;trange,
alterative Liquor, brought to <HI>&s;queak</HI> like tho&s;e <HI>Pipes,</HI>
which the <HI>Boys</HI> make of an <HI>Oat-&s;traw.</HI>&mdash;They, who u&s;ed
to leap Five-bar-Gates, Quick&s;et-Hedges, and Park-Palings, could not wag a
Hand, or a Foot, with|out <PB N="457" REF="464"> crying out of the Gout, or the
Rheuma|ti&s;m: The&s;e had been called in the World, COUNTRY 'SQUIRES, and were
active Men in their Time, at the Hunting down of a <HI>Fox,</HI> or crying up
of a <HI>Burge&s;s.</HI>&mdash;But it was di&s;mal to behold, what Faces they
made now, when the Fury &s;hew'd them their own Figures, in the &s;tartling
Gla&s;s of Reflection!</P>
<P>THE next Place, that old Mother CAUTION conducted me to, was a
gloomy Walk, which the farther we penetrated into it, was the deeper darkened
with the Shade of <HI>Juniper</HI> and <HI>Eugh</HI> Trees: In the mid&s;t, was
a Little Thatch'd Hou&s;e, as full as it could hold, of Earthen Ve&s;&s;els,
&s;tor'd with a <HI>Juice,</HI> that was but one Remove from <HI>Poy&s;on:</HI>
The poor Wretches, who frequented this dark Hovel, where mo&s;tly
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and pleaded the Privi|lilege of their <HI>Liberty,</HI> for
getting rid of their Sen&s;es, as <HI>freely,</HI> as their Countrymen, of
higher Quality, who paid <HI>dearer</HI> for the &s;ame <HI>Right,</HI> in
proportion to their better Circum|&s;tances, and dealt in Poy&s;ons of a
&s;lower Operation. Many Cu&s;tomers went in here but half Dre&s;s'd, and came
out again Naked; Mo&s;t of them labour'd under Mi&s;eries and Di&s;ea&s;es
without a Name; and &s;ome of them endeavour'd to hang them&s;elves on the
Trees that gave a Name to the fatal Liquor.&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT, I was <HI>tran&s;ported</HI> in the next Place I came to, and
flatter'd my Imagination, that I was got out of the infernal Regions, into
tho&s;e, which were form'd for Delight, and, <PB N="458" REF="465"> by the
Ancients, called, The <HI>Ely&s;ian Fields.</HI> I was led into a noble
Edifice, adorn'd with the mo&s;t magnificent Furniture, Gildings, Sculptures,
Paintings, Gla&s;s-Sconces, with hun|dreds of Wax Tapers lighted in them; the
Roofs ecchoed and re-&s;ounded, with the fine&s;t Mu|&s;ick, that cou'd ari&s;e
from the mo&s;t elegant Variety of the &s;weete&s;t In&s;truments. Here was an
A&s;&s;embly of the mo&s;t active and fine|&s;hap'd Gentlemen, together with a
Set of the mo&s;t &s;eemingly mode&s;t and beautiful Women, that ever my Eyes
beheld;&mdash;when, immediately, two <HI>Devils,</HI> in <HI>Ma&s;querade,
appear'd</HI> to the Company, with the mo&s;t complai&s;ant and inviting Airs
imaginable.&mdash;One of them led the Gentlemen to a luxuri|ous Table, adorn'd
with Cry&s;tals, repleni&s;h|ed with the &s;tronge&s;t and riche&s;t Wines, of
all Growths and Climates, and dealt Gla&s;&s;es round with Profu&s;ion: The
other, which was a <HI>She Devil,</HI> conducted the Ladies, in like Manner, to
another Table, richly ornament|ed with Silver Equipages, and Va&s;es of the
fine&s;t <HI>China,</HI> which were filled, as &s;he pre|tended, with Liquors,
that promoted <HI>Sobri|ety,</HI> but had really &s;o different an Effect, that
the Fumes and Vapours ari&s;ing from their <HI>Brimmers,</HI> forced me to
remove to a greater Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>This <HI>drinking</HI> Scene being fini&s;hed, the Word was given
to <HI>Mask</HI> and <HI>Dance</HI>;&mdash;But, in&s;tead of forming a regular
Motion, the whole Company, Male and Female, without <PB N="459" REF="466">
Di&s;tinction of Sex, Age or Condition, fell, jumbled, into one promi&s;cuous
Heap, upon which en&s;ued horrid Outcries, and a confus'd Cla&s;h of Swords,
from Men, who were mur|dering one another, about Daughters, Wives and
Si&s;ters: So that in a Moment, me|thought, like the &s;hifting of a Scene in
Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> this fine Apartment was chang'd in|to an
<HI>Ho&s;pital,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;h'd into little Clo|&s;ets, like
Cells.&mdash;In the&s;e unhappy little Cells, were Ladies under a Cour&s;e of
Tor|ment, (a Fury always holding before their Eyes, a Picture of their departed
Beauty:) I took Notice of <HI>One,</HI> who&s;e Picture repre|&s;ented the
&s;moothe&s;t, Satten Skin, with the fine&s;t Tincture imaginable, while the
blub|bering Original was melting away in Tears, with Cheeks &s;well'd into
Carbuncles, and &s;potted over with purple Pimples: Another, who&s;e Portrait
di&s;play'd a Loveline&s;s, almo&s;t Angelical, was &s;taring on it with
blood&s;hot Eyes, and a Face, &s;o di&s;torted with Convul|&s;ions, that &s;he
look'd, methought, more frightful than the <HI>Fury,</HI> that attended
her.&mdash;I begg'd of CAUTION to let me retreat from this melancholy
Man&s;ion, becau&s;e it fill'd me with more Horror than I was able to
&s;upport, to &s;ee the Effects of &s;uch &s;eeming Plea&s;antry, producing
De&s;pair and real Mi|&s;ery; and &s;uch alluring Beauty, betray'd in|to &s;uch
hideous and frightful Deformity.</P>
<P><PB N="460" REF="467">CAUTION was &s;o obliging, as to grant my
Petition in Part; but told me, That as I mu&s;t carry <HI>Warning</HI> with me,
when I return'd to the upper Regions, &s;he was under a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of
conducting me to &s;everal other Pla|ces. This made it impo&s;&s;ible for me to

which we old Peo|ple &s;ometimes lie under, of being <HI>tedious</HI> in our

<HI>Square</HI> open'd to my View, who&s;e <PB N="461" REF="468"> four Sides
were form'd by the fine&s;t Architec|ture. Tho&s;e Stately Palaces, my Guide

Ex|tent of Country, &s;he &s;hew'd me, by the Help of a Pro&s;pective Gla&s;s,
a Dozen fair <HI>Manor-Towns,</HI> all &s;urrounded by a plea&s;ant Variety of
Hills and Dales, Plains and Woods, Green Meadows and Corn Fields, richly waving
with a promis'd Harve&s;t: Gardens, and &s;weet <HI>Parterres,</HI> with Fi&s;h
Ponds and Canals that glitter'd thro' the Trees; All which, &s;he &s;aid, was
but a &s;mall Portion of the Earth, en|joy'd by this Son of Fortune, who was
Ma|&s;ter of that fine Palace we &s;tood in&mdash;This Hou&s;e had been, it
&s;eems, every Day, in the Afternoon, and every Night, and all the Night long,
crowded from Top to Bottom, with People of all Sexes, Ages, and Coun|tries;
who, provided they had the Merit of <HI>wanting nothing,</HI> were welcome to
partake of all the Abundance of this Place; where no|thing appear'd, but what
was noble and delightful. The Earth, from Pole to Pole, was ran&s;ack'd (as
were the <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Water</HI>) to &s;upply this Hou&s;e with

<P>CAUTION, at the <HI>Sound</HI> of every <HI>Health,</HI> bid me
view the Manors from the Garden Window; and I perceiv'd a Man in a Black Gown,
pre&s;enting a Roll of Parchment to another, who was a Jolly kind of Fellow,

the Villages and Manor-Towns, di&s;appear'd like Mi&s;ts, in a Sunny Morning;

<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Angui&s;h, the De&s;pair, of

<P>NO &s;ooner had the Gla&s;s gone round, but the <HI>Orator</HI>

in&s;i&s;ted, that All <PB N="465" REF="472"> &s;hould talk in their

Rule; and gallop'd, with a bawling Voice, through <HI>Divi&s;ions</HI> and
<HI>Subdivi&s;ions,</HI> 'till he had <HI>di&s;united</HI> the whole

thunder'd out <HI>Ana|thema</HI>'s again&s;t <HI>Di&s;puting at all,</HI> where
the Bu&s;ine&s;s, they met for, was <HI>Drinking.</HI>&mdash;The
<HI>Mathematician</HI> was muttering <HI>Problems,</HI> and tracing out a
<HI>Globe</HI> upon the Table, with his <HI>Fingers</HI> dipt in the
<HI>Liquor</HI> that the Scufflers had <HI>&s;pilt</HI> upon it; and the
<HI>fine-bred Gentleman</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Depth of his important
De&s;igns, was pouring more Wine, to that which was &s;pilt already, le&s;t he
might want a Supply of Liquor; But ju&s;t as the Figure was upon the Point of
being fini&s;hed, the Officer &s;wore it made <HI>dull Company,</HI> and rubb'd
it out with his Sleeve: The <HI>Mathematician</HI> &s;eeing his <HI>Globe

<P>WHEN the Fury was ju&s;t going to re|&s;tore them to their
Sen&s;es again, that they might perform over the &s;ame Exerci&s;e, (which they
do, it &s;eems, every Hour, ju&s;t as &s;trange Sights are &s;hewn in Fairs, or
as Drunken Men renew their waking Debauches, after a little Interval of Sleep
in their Life|times) I left them, with a pungent Regret, that there &s;hould be
in Liquor &s;uch a Power of turning <HI>Strength</HI> into <HI>Weakne&s;s,
Health</HI> into <HI>Sickne&s;s, Beauty</HI> into <HI>Deformity, Riches</HI>
into <HI>Poverty, Friend&s;hip</HI> into <HI>Murder, Wi&s;|dom</HI> into
<HI>Folly,</HI> and <HI>Wit</HI> into <HI>Madne&s;s!</HI></P>
<P>I WAK'D, with no &s;mall Wonder at this &s;leeping Ramble of my
Imagination: But turning over a Collection of Old News-Pa|pers, bound up in
Volumes, from the <HI>Re&s;to|ration,</HI> gradually downward, I found them
fill'd with Yearly Proofs, that Men act the very &s;ame Follies,
<HI>waking</HI> in this World, that I had been Dreaming were done in the
other.</P>
<P>THERE I found Accounts of Men of great E&s;tates, dead in a
Pri&s;on, from the Effects of Drinking:&mdash;Quarrels every jot as
fanta&s;tical as any I have been de&s;cribing&mdash;There were Accounts of Men
ca&s;ting Lots, <PB N="467" REF="474"> in their Liquor, which &s;hould be
<HI>hang'd,</HI> and which the <HI>Hangman</HI>;&mdash;Here were fine
Hi&s;tories of others, who, in a ridicu|lous Bravado, had drank the Health of
the <HI>Devil,</HI> in a Punch-bowl &s;ea&s;on'd with <HI>Opium,</HI> and
launch'd down, while the Humour was on 'em, to pay a Vi&s;it to their grateful
Patron.&mdash;I look'd back as far as the Time, when certain wild Bea&s;ts,
called <HI>Mo|hocks,</HI> had broke loo&s;e, here in <HI>London</HI>; and I
found that it was no new Thing for Generals, and Common Soldiers, Lords,
Watchmen, and Drawers, Counts, Coblers and Hackney-Coachmen, to engage in
<HI>no unequal</HI> Matches together, and fight with all the <HI>Triumph</HI>
of <HI>Drunkenne&s;s</HI>; nay, what is more, I found all this as duly
<HI>repeated here,</HI> as I dreamt it to be in the Lower Regions.</P>
<P>WHILE I was thus poring over my News Papers, and reflecting, that
the <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Man,</HI> tallied exactly (as to its Extravagance)
with the Dreams of his di&s;order'd <HI>Fancy,</HI> I heard a Noi&s;e in the
Street, as if all <HI>Barbican</HI> were in an Uproar, and looking out of my
Window, I &s;aw Men with gil|ded Staves, and an Air of exerted Magi&s;tra|cy,
knocking down a Set of roaring little <HI>Heroes,</HI> with <HI>Leeks</HI> in
their Hats.&mdash;In|quiring into the Matter, I was told, by an Arch-Wag
(&s;miling, as if he derided my Ignorance) That it was nothing, but a few
<HI>Wel&s;hmen</HI>; who were got <HI>Loyally</HI> <PB N="468" REF="475">
<HI>Drunk,</HI> and did &s;ober People a Mi&s;chief, in Honour of the good
Saint, their <HI>Patron.</HI></P>
<P>I RESOLV'D then (as extravagant as my Thoughts &s;eem'd to me
before, and per|fectly <HI>remov'd</HI> out of Nature) to pen them down;
&s;ince I found, &s;uch Per&s;ons did <HI>really exi&s;t,</HI> as I had
believ'd, Imagination could only <HI>&s;hadow,</HI> in the prepo&s;terous
Incon&s;i|&s;tence of a Dream.&mdash;It may, thought I, be of <HI>U&s;e,</HI>
to &s;hew Men, who are ad|dicted to this Vice, their Pictures, plac'd in the
fulle&s;t Point of Ab&s;urdity: And, &s;ince mo&s;t of them take <HI>Hell</HI>
to be a <HI>Dream,</HI> it is natural enough to expect, that a <HI>Dream</HI>
of <HI>Hell</HI> may divert them.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Author of the <HI>PLAIN DEALER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> PERCEIVING, that it is cu&s;toma|ry, for you, to receive
Letters from our Sex, I am willing to throw my&s;elf into your Protection, in
Hopes of meeting with a favourable Regard from you, and that you may
a&s;&s;i&s;t me in my Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P> I AM a young Woman of &s;ome Fortune, and of no mean
Extraction; and was, &s;ome Months ago, the <HI>Happie&s;t Woman in the
World:</HI> My Story, in &s;hort, is this: There was a young Gentleman, every
way &s;uperior <PB N="476" REF="483"> to my&s;elf, thought fit to make his
Addre&s;|&s;es to me. At fir&s;t I concluded, from the Inequality of our
Fortunes, that he did it purely for a little Diver&s;ion; but, by I know not
what kind of Infatuation, I was &s;oon per&s;waded, to believe he was ju&s;t
and &s;in|cere in his Preten&s;ions. From hence, there &s;prang an Intimacy
between us, which la&s;t|ed a con&s;iderable Time, and which, I ne|ver thought
would have a Period, 'till Death had &s;eparated us for ever: But, behold the
Vici&s;&s;itudes and Changes of Life! the un|expected Turns of Fortune! which
no Hu|mnn Fore&s;ight can prevent: When I thought my&s;elf almo&s;t arrived to
the highe&s;t Perfe|ction of earthly Happine&s;s, <HI>Strephon,</HI> the unkind
<HI>Strephon!</HI> for&s;ook me, and bereft me of all my Joys, and Hopes, at
once.</P>
<P> IT is to me very &s;urprizing, that &s;o intimate a
Corre&s;pondence, which was carried on with &s;o much pretended Satisfaction,
on his Part, &s;hou'd now be &s;o irk&s;ome to him, as to make him avoid my
Company, and even the very Sight of me. I cannot pretend to penetrate into his
<HI>Thoughts,</HI> but I am &s;ure his <HI>Actions</HI> always carried in them
the Marks of a real and unfeigned Pa&s;&s;ion. He &s;eem'd ever &s;tudious, to
<HI>divert</HI> and <HI>plea&s;e</HI> me; and trea|ted me, with a
<HI>Civility</HI> and <HI>Re&s;pect,</HI> which is not common, even in the
mo&s;t <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate Lover.</HI> It is now, I think, two Months &s;ince he
payed me a Vi&s;it; nor have I heard from him, to let me know the Rea&s;on of
his <PB N="477" REF="484"> Ab&s;ence, which, together with &s;ome private
Intimations I have had from others, gives me &s;ufficient Grounds to believe he
is <HI>fal&s;e.</HI></P>
<P> AND is it po&s;&s;ible! after &s;uch an uncom|mon Behaviour, he
&s;hould abandon, nay, <HI>de&s;pi&s;e</HI> the Per&s;on he once appear'd &s;o
much to admire! Are the&s;e his Prote&s;tations of <HI>eternal Love!</HI> Is
<HI>this</HI> his <HI>Friend&s;hip?</HI> Has he &s;o &s;oon forgot his Vows, of
Con&s;tancy and Fidelity? <HI>Who,</HI> even of the mo&s;t <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> and
<HI>Prudent,</HI> could have &s;u&s;pected, much le&s;s di&s;cern'd
<HI>Deceit,</HI> under the fair Appear|ance of &s;o much &s;eeming
<HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Since|rity?</HI> I was &s;o far from di&s;tru&s;ting
him, whom, I thought, the <HI>Virtuous</HI> and <HI>Gene|rous Strephon,</HI>
that I put my whole Confi|dence in him, and was innocently betray'd, by the
irre&s;i&s;table Charms of his Eloquence.</P>
<P> I HAVE wrote to him, &s;everal Times, &s;ince he has left me;
but either my Let|ters were intercepted, or he is wholly re|gardle&s;s of them;
for I have not, as yet, received an An&s;wer; nor can I, by any Means, inform
my&s;elf, what has been the Cau&s;e of his unkind Separation. For this
Rea&s;on, I take this publick Opportunity, both to ask your Advice, in &s;o
critical a Juncture, and to convince him, of his di&s;|ingenuous Treatment of
one, for whom he pretended, once, to have the mo&s;t unalte|rable Veneration.
If you think fit, to give this Letter a Place, in one of your Papers, I know it
will come to his Hands; and, <PB N="478" REF="485"> perhaps, &s;uch a Memorial,
under your Au|thority and Protection, may have a greater Influence over him
than any common Epi|&s;tle. I de&s;ire therefore you will in&s;ert it, and
oblige your mo&s;t humble Servant,</P>

<P> IT is a common Ob&s;ervation, That Trees that <HI>Blo&s;&s;om
&s;oone&s;t,</HI> are liable to be &s;oone&s;t Fro&s;t nipt. As if Nature, by
ob|&s;erving the full Growth of &s;uch forward Virtues, mi&s;took the
Progre&s;s of Years, and mea&s;ured <HI>Maturity</HI> not by <HI>Age,</HI> but
by <HI>Character.</HI></P>
<P> I MOURN the Mi&s;ery, Mr. PLAIN DEALER, of having lately lo&s;t
a <HI>Friend,</HI> who&s;e Picture I will pre&s;ent you with, as it is drawn to
the Life, in my Memory!&mdash;</P>
<P> IN Bu&s;ine&s;s there was a <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> always
triumphing over his Hurry; &s;uch a Suavity and Complacence in his Behaviour,
as at|tracted the <HI>Heart,</HI> before the <HI>Head</HI> could have Time to
<HI>weigh</HI> him. He was &s;ub&s;er|vient to no Pa&s;&s;ion, but
<HI>Love,</HI> which made him a Friend to all Mankind, nor could tho&s;e narrow
Limits of Soul, which con|tract Mens <HI>Friend&s;hips</HI> to their
<HI>Intere&s;ts,</HI> re|&s;train <PB N="479" REF="486"> his boundle&s;s
Genero&s;ity, which made him <HI>Every Body's,</HI> who had
<HI>Mi&s;eries,</HI> with|in the Compa&s;s of his Ea&s;ing. He had &s;o
feveri&s;h a <HI>Thir&s;t</HI> of <HI>Obliging,</HI> that an Enemy would have
call'd his Liberality rather his <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> than his
<HI>Ornament.</HI> He &s;ought for no Reward, but the <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> of
tho&s;e he favour'd; and if at any Time it was not in his Power to
<HI>grant,</HI> he was more a&s;ham'd, and un&s;atisfied, than the Per&s;on
whom he di&s;appointed; and, by way of Atonement, injoined him&s;elf the
Penance of <HI>watching</HI> for &s;ome <HI>happier</HI> Opportunity, when he
cou'd meet the Wi&s;h above half way, and prevent its Explanation.</P>
<P> NOR did this Benevolence of his Nature extend only to tho&s;e
within the Sphere of his Acquaintance; who&s;e-ever Misfortunes came to his
Knowledge, made an equal, and noble Impre&s;&s;ion;&mdash;For he
<HI>impro|priated</HI> all Mens Griefs, till he had le&s;&s;en'd them, by
<HI>Comforts.</HI></P>
<P> IF there were any &s;o Ungenerous as to make him their
<HI>Enemy,</HI> he was as willing to forgive, as they to offer the
Injury.&mdash;Judge, then, how happy mu&s;t tho&s;e few have been, who were
ble&s;t with his Inti|macy! Whatever Tenderne&s;s is conceived in Nature from
Mothers to their new-born Infants, may de&s;erve to pa&s;s as &s;ome faint
Image of his Sweetne&s;s:&mdash;His Faith, and his Friend&s;hips, were as
la&s;ting as his <HI>Life</HI> was.</P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="487"> WITH all the&s;e Advantages, never had
Man an humbler Opinion of him&s;elf; which was an Armor that defended him,
again&s;t the <HI>Flattery</HI> of Fortune, as his Stea|dine&s;s de&s;pis'd her
<HI>Malice.</HI> To <HI>Him,</HI> to be <HI>High</HI> or <HI>Low,</HI> were
Accidents merely indif|ferent: The one cou'd neither exalt, nor cou'd the other
depre&s;s his Sentiments: And had Heaven thought fit to have ex|empted his
Body, like his Mind, from In|firmities, He had been as well <HI>Immortal</HI>
as <HI>Ine&s;timable.</HI> The fa&s;hionable Vanities which allure and
captivate young Hearts, could never get Admittance into his ma&s;culine, and
di&s;cerning Bo&s;om, always guarded by Rea&s;on and Virtue. He renounc'd, in
the Pride of his Youth, tho&s;e Enjoyments which others content them&s;elves
with di&s;claiming, when the Power of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them is either lo&s;t
or abated; Oh! I am left in a <HI>De&s;art,</HI> without this Guide, that my
fond Soul hung upon! And nothing remains, but the Influence of his
<HI>Example,</HI> that can be worth the Wi&s;h of any Man, who had the
Ble&s;|&s;ing to be acquainted with him.&mdash;</P>
<P> IN Ju&s;tice to his Memory, allow this little Specimen of my
departed Friend, a Place in one of your Papers, and you will much oblige,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I HAVE had &s;uch an Over-mind to &s;ee you, that I came to
Town on purpo&s;e, being a Kind of <HI>Plain Dealer</HI> my&s;elf. For tho'f I
am a Country Fellow, and no <HI>La|tin</HI> Scollard, yet I reckon my&s;elf the
wi&s;e&s;t in our whole Pari&s;h, except (mayhap) the Par&s;on: And he is &s;o
churli&s;h, that one dare not <HI>deal plainly</HI> with him. I believe you to
be no proud Man, and that made me &s;o bold as to come to &s;eek you out, being
in hopes to have told our Par&s;on, that I had conver&s;ed, in my Time, with as
<HI>Learned</HI> a Man as he.</P>
<P> GOOD Ma&s;ter PLAIN DEALER, be &s;o kind as to tell a Body, in
your next Paper, where you may be &s;ound, and rather than lo&s;e the Sight of
&s;o good-natur'd, an old Man, I will come once more on purpo&s;e, tho'f I
&s;hou'd have no other Bu&s;ine&s;s. When I enquired after you, I thought I
&s;hou'd ne'er have found you out; but then, at la&s;t, I was told, by a very
young Man, that you was to be met with, at the <HI>Tower</HI> of
<HI>Barbican.</HI>&mdash;Z'lids, I was never &s;o &s;o glad in all my
Life-time; but &s;oon after I found I had nothing to be glad on, and I doubt
the Rogue put the <HI>City-Bite</HI> upon me; for I have &s;earched every Crick
and Corner to find out &s;uch a <HI>Tower,</HI> and could <PB N="482" REF="489"> get no News of it: <HI>Barbican</HI> I did find, and the
<HI>Tower</HI> I did find; but I cou'd find no <HI>Tower</HI> of
<HI>Barbican.</HI> I have worn out two Shooes by the Bargain, that were as good
as any two Pair I can get hereabouts. Pray, if there be any &s;uch
<HI>Tower,</HI> and you live in it, I be&s;eech you to order Matters &s;o, that
I may come to find it out.</P>
<P> I READ your Papers, and under&s;tand them as well as mo&s;t
other Folks, all but your <HI>Top Sentences,</HI> which are generally &s;o
hard, that they puzzle all our Pari&s;h. The be&s;t Scollards of us put our
Heads toge|ther to find out their Meaning; and, when we can't agree about it,
we go to con&s;ult our Par&s;on; and, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, he pro|nounces
a hard Judgment upon them.&mdash;He does not think it <HI>worth his
Trouble</HI> (he &s;ays) to <HI>under&s;tand</HI> Heathen <HI>Authors,</HI>
be|cau&s;e tho&s;e Men were &s;eldom good <HI>Chri|&s;tians.</HI>&mdash;But
this &s;hall not prevent my Reading your Papers, for I have a better Opinion of
you, than to think &s;o prophane|ly of any of your Friends and Acquain|tance.
Being in over-great Ha&s;te for the Country, have but ju&s;t Time to put you in
mind of me, and, wi&s;hing you in good Health, as I am at this pre&s;ent
Writing (ble&s;&s;ed be God for it) remain,</P>

<P> TURNING over the Works of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> lately
u&s;her'd into the World by an extravagant Sub&s;cription, and finding the Six
Volumes, tho' called <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI>'s Works, contained not his VENUS
and ADONIS, his TARQUIN and LU|CRECE, and numberle&s;s other Mi&s;cellane|ous
Pieces, which, for Richne&s;s of Fancy, and the many beautiful De&s;criptions
that adorn them, are far from being inferior to &s;ome of his more celebrated
Labours; I thought my &s;elf obliged to become a Pur|cha&s;er of the Seventh

<P><PB N="484" REF="491"> YOU, Mr. PLAIN DEALER, who&s;e

<SALUTE>Dear Slavy,</SALUTE></OPENER>

<P>IT would be unrea&s;onable for any of my <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>
Readers to expect a better Excu&s;e than This, for my taking Leave of them,
&s;o abruptly.&mdash;It is po&s;&s;ible, however, that, <PB N="495" REF="502">
when our <HI>fir&s;t Hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> is a little over, I may have
Lei&s;ure, more than enough, to <HI>talk on,</HI> as I have done hitherto: But
un|der what <HI>Name,</HI> or <HI>Shape,</HI> I &s;hall make my Appearance, is
a Matter I am wholly <HI>dark</HI> in.&mdash;This only I am &s;ure of, and
agree heartily with <HI>Her,</HI> in, That it mu&s;t be any Thing rather than a
<HI>Plain Dealer</HI>; the Aver|&s;ion, if I am not mi&s;taken, of every
<HI>Wife,</HI> in Chri&s;tendom!</P>
<P>BUT to &s;often as much as po&s;&s;ible the Abruptne&s;s of my
Departure, it may not be ami&s;s to &s;pend a little Conver&s;ation upon
tho&s;e agreeable Corre&s;pondents, and indulgent Readers, which, in the
Cour&s;e of this Work, I have met with: Next to the Plea&s;ure of do|ing Good,
the greate&s;t, is to meet with Appro|bation and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in our
Attempts towards it: This has been my Happine&s;s, and I hope it cannot be
attributed to any reproachable Weakne&s;s, when I confe&s;s I feel a Pang at
part|ing with it. Barely to acknowledge amounts to Gratitude in tho&s;e People
whom Fortune does not enable to return a Benefit; that is, at pre&s;ent, my
Ca&s;e: My approaching Fate will allow me to make no better a Payment than
Thanks, which therefore I de&s;ire may be candidly accepted.</P>
<P>WHEN I had written thus far, an Acquain|tance, whom in &s;ome of
the preceding Di&s;|cour&s;es I have recommended to the publick for a
Pertne&s;s of Conceit and Flippancy of Tongue, happened to come into my Room, 
<PB N="496" REF="503"> and taking up the Paper ran it ha&s;tily over, then
throwing it down with a petulant Sneer, and a brisk Voice, cry'd out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Foregad, con|&s;idering your Sentiments, and
Circum|&s;tances, grave Sir, I can't help comparing you to a Criminal taking
leave of the Bye-Standers with Tears in his Eyes, before his
Execution.&mdash;Faith, I long to &s;ee thee turn'd off, thoul't make the
prettie&s;t Fi|gure of a <HI>Dangler:</HI> ha, ha,"</Q>&mdash;Then, changing
his Allegory, continued his Im|pertinence thus, 
<Q REND="inline">"Matrimony, my good Friend, is a long and
tire&s;ome Journey, and the wor&s;t Road that ever you travell'd in&mdash;You
&s;eem unea&s;y, but &s;ure you can|not in Con&s;cience be di&s;plea&s;ed that
I &s;hould take up <HI>Plain-Dealing</HI> ju&s;t where you left it off&mdash;If
you are, to make you Amends, I promi&s;e never to imitate you in any Thing,
particularly your la&s;t Re&s;olution of com|mitting that dreadful Sin of
Matrimony&mdash;Believe me, Friend, the Man that &s;igns Marriage Articles,
gives it under his Hand that he's a Fool."</Q></P>
<P>TO this I an&s;wered very gravely, That before I left off
<HI>Plain Dealing</HI> ab&s;olutely, I was re&s;olved to give him one
Le&s;&s;on which might be of u&s;e to him in his Practice. 
<Q REND="inline">"You are to remember, continued I, that he who
gives Advice, &s;hould always take Care to do it in &s;uch a Manner, that his
Advice may not appear to be an In&s;ult upon the Character or Under&s;tanding

<P>BUT to pa&s;s by this volatile Spark, who if I divine aright, will
in every re&s;pect act like a modern fine Gentleman, that is, continue a
Batchelor till Sixty, to &s;hew his <HI>Wit,</HI> and then marry his
Hou&s;e-Keeper, to &s;hew his <HI>Judgment</HI>; let me return to the
Conver&s;a|tion which he interrupted, tho' I mu&s;t take &s;o much Notice of
his Opinion, that I pro|mi&s;e my Readers if ever I appear again in Publick, I
&s;hall amply and impartially con|&s;ider it, by which Time perhaps my own
Ob&s;ervations and Experience will better en|able me to make a clear and
&s;atisfactory Com|ment upon it.</P>
<P>FAREWELL, then, Gentle Readers, be happy as I am &s;hortly to be;
I have, on my part, endeavour'd to plea&s;e; and you on yours have &s;hewn
&s;ome Regard for my Endeavours: Till I can again attend you, I wi&s;h you
heartily a more agreeable In&s;tructor; but think not my per&s;uading you to
<HI>good Humour</HI> at Part|ing, an Incon&s;i&s;tence in my Character; for

being agreeably dre&s;s'd: The common Forms of Civility, tho' they are often
the Di&s;gui&s;es of In&s;incerity, are no Di&s;grace to an hone&s;t Heart, and
a good In|tention. Where they are made u&s;e of to <HI>conceal</HI> our
Sentiments, they are wicked and abomi|nable; <PB N="498" REF="505"> where only
