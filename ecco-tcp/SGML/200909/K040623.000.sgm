<HEAD>THE LIFE OF WILLIAM BAKER.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Rev. Mr. GILPIN.</BYLINE>
<P>WILLIAM BAKER was born in the year 1710, in the pari&s;h of Boldre, near Lymington, in Hamp&s;hire, His father dying when he was two years old, left him and a &s;i&s;ter to the care of his widow; who by taking in wa&s;hing, maintained her two child|ren without any relief from the pari&s;h.&mdash;In the&s;e days &s;uch indu&s;try would exceed belief.</P>
<P>At &s;even years of age young Baker began that life of labour, which he continued through the &s;pace of &s;eventy years afterwards. He worked fir&s;t for a penny a day in the vicarage-garden; but &s;oon thought him|&s;elf equal to more profitable labour. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, he always con&s;idered him&s;elf as a poor friendle&s;s lad; and from the beginning depended only on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mean time his mother grew old, and infirm. Her legs &s;welled, and &s;he could no longer &s;tand at her wa&s;h-tub. But nothing hurt her like the thoughts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oing to the poor-hou&s;e, or living on alms.</P>
<P>Her &s;on was now about eighteen. He was healthy and &s;trong; and a&s;&s;ured his mother, that while he was able to work for her, &s;he &s;hould be obliged to nobody. He took a little cottage therefore on the edge of the fore&s;t; carried her to it; and got into the &s;er|vice of a farmer in the neighbourhood, as a day-la|bourer. His mother lived nine years after this; du|ring which time he maintained her with great cheer|fulne&s;s, and kindne&s;s: nor had &s;he ever a&s;&s;i&s;tance from
<PB N="3" REF="3">any other per&s;on. He denied him&s;elf every little in|dulgence, which young fellows of that age often take, that he might maintain his mother.&mdash;We do not often &s;ee &s;uch an in&s;tance of goodne&s;s in a poor lad. It marked his character as &s;omething uncommon. He might, if he had plea&s;ed, have had her maintained by the pari&s;h.</P>
<P>About the time of his mother's death he thought of marrying. At a little di&s;tance from him, under the hill, lived a labourer of the name of Brooks. His daughter Joanna was the per&s;on whom Baker fixed on for a wife; and no objection being made, he mar|ried her, and brought her to his cottage. Joanna had lived under a careful mother, ju&s;t in the way in which he him&s;elf had always lived; and with the &s;ame no|tions of indu&s;try and frugality. She entered therefore into all her hu&s;band's intentions. What he gained, &s;he put to the be&s;t u&s;e. <HI>We both pulled the rope,</HI> he u&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>by the &s;ame end; and &s;o we compa&s;&s;ed many things, which they cannot do, who pull it at different ends.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, his family increa&s;ed: and his indu&s;try increa&s;ed with it. He now never worked <HI>by the day,</HI> if he could help it; but took the harde&s;t <HI>ta&s;k-work</HI> he could get, by which the mo&s;t money was to be earned.&mdash;And that he might <HI>never</HI> be idle, he took, at a &s;mall rent, of Mrs. John Burrard, of Lymington, a piece of rough ground, about nine or ten acres, on which he might employ his lei&s;ure. Many a time he was &s;een working in it before &s;un-ri&s;e; and if his day's work had not been hard, in an evening by moon-light. In a few years he made it worth much more, than when he took it; and he found it of great u&s;e to his family
<PB N="4" REF="4">in furni&s;hing him &s;ometimes with a crop of potatoes&mdash;or a little corn&mdash;or a few loads of hay; which en|abled him to keep two or three cows, and as many fore&s;t-colts&mdash;Some years after, his good land-lady died; and this piece of land fell into the hands of Mr. Brailsfield, of Kenti&s;h-town; who finding it was tenanted by a man, who had taken &s;o much pains to improve it, promi&s;ed neither to rai&s;e his rent, nor to take it from him; which I mention to his honour.&mdash;Thus a kind of providence ble&s;&s;ed all Baker's de&s;igns; and he was richer, than many a man who is born to thou&s;ands. These are few men, who may not live comfortably, if they live <HI>according to their &s;tation:</HI> and if they <HI>do not,</HI> the highe&s;t &s;tations will not &s;ecure them from difficulties. I have often heard Baker &s;ay, he never knew what want was: but then he never re|laxed his u&s;ual frugality. When wheat was dear, to make all ends meet, he lived on barley; and when he could not with convenience compa&s;s bu&s;hel of malt, he contented him&s;elf with milk, or water.</P>
<P>He had now five children, who were a con&s;tant claim upon all his indu&s;try, and frugality. But he had other claims. He had been kind to his &s;i&s;ter, tho' her behaviour did not entirely plea&s;e him: and he was now called on from a quarter, he did not expect. His wife's father, grown old, applied to him for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Of this man he never had a high opinion; but for his mother-in-law he had always the greate&s;t e&s;teem. <HI>She was as good a woman,</HI> he u&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>as his wife; and he could not &s;ay more for any woman on earth.</HI> However, tho' he could not pretend, with the incumbrance of &s;o large a family, to maintain them entirely, he agreed with the over&s;eers of the pari&s;h, that if they would
<PB N="5" REF="5">pay them a &s;hilling a week, he would do the re&s;t. Ac|cordingly he built them a little cottage; and was as kind to them as he could. Soon after, on the old man's death, he took his mother-in-law into his hou&s;e, and kept her till &s;he died; tho' &s;he lived till &s;he was up|wards of ninety; and was blind many years.</P>
<P>About the time, that his children were pretty well grown up a fortunate circum&s;tance happened. He re|ceived a legacy of &s;ewenty pounds, and a clock. This money came very happily to &s;ettle &s;ome of his child|ren, <HI>They had it all,</HI> he &s;aid. <HI>among them: he never had a belly full of meant out of it him&s;elf.</HI> The clock alone he kept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> clock was the only piece of furniture he ever coveted; and he always intended, if it &s;hould be in his power, to have purcha&s;ed one: tho' it is probable, if a clock had not been thus thrown in his way, he would always have found &s;omething more u&s;eful for the employment of his money.</P>
<P>Nor was he kind only to his relations, as he got forward in the world, he was very friendly among his neighbours; and lent many a little &s;um to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es. But as he was a very &s;hrewd, intel|ligent man, he lent only where he &s;aw his money could be of u&s;e; to the &s;pendthrift he would lend nothing: nor to any man, who frequented an ale-hou&s;e. So judicious was he in the&s;e loans, that altho' he helped many a man out of a difficulty, I have heard him &s;ay, he never lo&s;t a farthing by lending money in his life. Often indeed he received the worth of what he had lent, in a little corn, a pig, a calf, or &s;omething that was more convenient for the borrower to pay with, than money.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6">He was now advancing into years, and his good Joanna began to feel the effects of age more than he did. Her ailment was a mere decay of nature: but &s;he was &s;o entirely weakened, that &s;he could do no|thing for her&s;elf. Her hu&s;band hired a woman into the hou&s;e to attend her near &s;even years, in which &s;he continued in this helple&s;s &s;tate. Every thing he could do, he did for a woman, <HI>who,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>had been kinder so every body than her&s;elf.</HI> In the year 1776 &s;he died; and left him greatly afflicted for the lo&s;s of a faithful friend, who had followed clo&s;e by his &s;ide, through all his la|borious life, for the &s;pace of forty years. I have &s;een him &s;peak of her with tears in his eyes, and agitation in all he &s;aid, at the age of eighty.</P>
<P>He had now the world, in a manner, to begin again. His children were all married, or di&s;per&s;ed: and he had nobody with him, on who&s;e arm he could lean in de&s;cending the hill. He thought the wi&s;e&s;t thing he could do, was to draw his little matters into as &s;mall a compa&s;s as he could; and rid him&s;elf, as much as po&s;|&s;ible, of the cares of the world. Accordingly he &s;old his cows, and hor&s;es, and a little tenement or two, which he had purcha&s;ed, and brought one hundred and ten pounds to a friend to put to &s;ome u&s;e. <HI>For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I cannot now,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>work my&s;elf, I mu&s;t make my money,</HI> as he phra&s;ed it, <HI>work for me.</HI> His friend made him under&s;tand, as well as he could, what was meant by the funds; and advi&s;ed him to put his money into con&s;olidated annuities for twenty-eight years from January 1780. As this tran&s;action was in the year 1782, when the funds were low, he was made to under&s;tand, that the intere&s;t would be con&s;iderable (about eight pounds a year) but that the whole would
<PB N="7" REF="7">be lo&s;t, if he &s;hould live twenty-&s;ix years. However, as he did not look forward to that time, he took his friend's advice. Be&s;ides this property, he had two or three other little &s;ums put out to intere&s;t in private hands; and a little tenement, which he re&s;erved for him&s;elf to live in; with two or three patches of ground, which lay near him, and &s;erved to employ him.</P>
<P>He had a good opinion of the charitable &s;ocieties. or <HI>clubs,</HI> as they are called, in the &s;everal pari&s;hes around him; but he thought them u&s;eful chiefly to tho&s;e, who could not depend upon them&s;elves. If young fellows could depend on them&s;elves, and lay the &s;ame money by, without breaking into it, he thought it might ge|nerally be more u&s;eful to them. Four-pence a week would amount to near a pound in the year. At harve&s;t &s;ome little matter might be added to it. And if this prac|tice were begun early in life, in a few years, it might amount to a comfortable &s;upport in &s;ickne&s;s, or old age. <HI>But few young fellows,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>looked forward to tho&s;e times. They never thought of more than of living from hand to mouth.</HI></P>
<P>His manner <HI>now</HI> of &s;pending his time, was &s;omewhat different from what it u&s;ed to be. He worked only a little, every morning, in his grounds; or in his garden; or in procuring fuel. The re&s;t of his time he &s;pent in reading and in devotion. He had always been a &s;erious man; but a bu&s;y life had never allowed him much time for anything but bu&s;ine&s;s. He had now gotten above the world&mdash;had his time much to him&s;elf&mdash;and &s;pent a great part of it in reading the bible, which was the only book he did read. He had the u&s;e of his eyes to the la&s;t; and generally, though by him&s;elf, read out; which he though made the more impre&s;&s;ion on his
<PB N="8" REF="8">memory. Oftener than once, as I have approached his lonely cottage, I have thought I heard voices: but when I entered, the old man was &s;itting alone, with his bible before him. He had as &s;trong natural parts, as I almo&s;t ever met with; and ea&s;ily under&s;tood, not only the general meaning, and intention of the go&s;pel; but many of the mo&s;t difficult pa&s;&s;ages in it. What our Saviour &s;aid, he thought, was very ea&s;y; and much of what St. Paul &s;aid. And he told me, he had a very good book of prayers, in his phra&s;e, <HI>for all in|tents and purpo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>As he grew more, and more infirm, his friends thought it comfortle&s;s for him to live entirely by him|&s;elf; and endeavoured to per&s;uade him to get &s;ome good old woman to live with him; who might take care of his hou&s;e, and likewi&s;e of him, if any thing &s;hould ail him, <HI>Aye,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>if I could get &s;ome good old woman: but where is &s;he to be found?</HI> He had tried the experi|ment, he &s;aid; but had no encouragement to try it again. People would not, he added, live now, as he lived. Perhaps he had bad luck in his choice; but he found, that a woman now would &s;pend as much in junketting in one day, as would &s;erve him for two. Then, he &s;aid, there was &s;uch con&s;tant go flipping, and noi&s;e in his hou&s;e, that he could never have his time at his own di&s;po&s;al. In &s;hort, he was obliged to live as they cho&s;e, not as he cho&s;e him&s;elf. Then fetching a deep &s;igh, he would &s;ay, <HI>His good Joanna had &s;poiled him for living with any other woman.</HI></P>
<P>It was then propo&s;ed to him to live with one of his daughters, who was married in the neighbour|hood.&mdash;He had thought of that, he &s;aid: but an old man was always giving offence to one, or another
<PB N="9" REF="9">and one or another was always giving offence to him. Be&s;ides, he &s;aid, his daughter had &s;everal children; and &s;o much noi&s;e did not &s;uit his quiet way of living, He could now, at his own ea&s;e, follow his own incli|nation. In &s;hort, it appeared, that while he lived, he wi&s;hed to live entirely to him&s;elf; and that it was very indifferent to him, when, and where, and how he died.</P>
<P>The de&s;titute condition however in which he lived, laid him open to the depredations of a di&s;hone&s;t neigh|bourhood. Many little thefts, when he was watched out of his hou&s;e, were committed. Among other things his pewter-flaggon was &s;tolen. It hung over his dre&s;&s;er, and contained all his little &s;ecurities, and promi&s;&s;ory notes. He had however, with his u&s;ual &s;agacity, placed his money in &s;uch &s;afe hands, that he had on this oc|ca&s;ion on lo&s;s.</P>
<P>But among the petty thefts, which were committed in his hou&s;e, was a robbery of very &s;erious nature. On the day before Lymington-fair the old man had received &s;ome intere&s;t money (about five guineas) to purcha&s;e a few nece&s;&s;aries. This being probably known, two men, at midnight, broke into his hou&s;e. His fa&s;ten|ing indeed was only &s;uch as a good &s;hake might ea&s;ily di&s;lodge. They &s;oon entered; and one of them pre&s;&s;ing a bol&s;ter over his face, pinned him down with his knee; while the other &s;ought for the money, which was pre&s;ently found. I heard him &s;peak of the tran&s;|action the next day; and his behaviour rai&s;ed him in my opinion. He &s;poke with the caution of an hone&s;t man. The thieves had a dark lantern, he &s;aid, with them; and he thought he could &s;wear to one of them; but he dur&s;t not venture it, where a man's life and character were concerned.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="10">From &s;everal circum&s;tances however it became more probable, that the man, whom Baker &s;u&s;pected, was guilty. And indeed he him&s;elf &s;oon after confirmed the &s;u&s;picion: for as the neighbours began more to talk of the thing, and to lay facts together, he thought it prudent to leave the country.&mdash;Indeed if wiched men would only con&s;ider before hand the many cir|cum&s;tances, that lead to di&s;covery; and the almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ibility of providing again&s;t them all, they would be more cautious, on the mere principles of prudence, in committing any de&s;perate wickedne&s;s. One circum|&s;tance which tended to fix the &s;u&s;picion of the fact on this man, was, that a child accidentally mentioned having &s;een a cut-chee&s;e in his hou&s;e the day after the robbery. Baker had lo&s;t a cut-chee&s;e; and it was well-known the man had no chee&s;e in his hou&s;e before. The other per&s;on too was &s;u&s;pected: but if either of them had been taken up, it would mo&s;t probably, have di&s;|covered both: for a knave cannot be depended on. And indeed it is probable, that both would have been di&s;covered, had it not been for the old man's &s;cru|ples.&mdash;I mention all the&s;e circum&s;tances, to &s;hew, that, in fact, it requires more care, and caution, to commit a wicked action, than mo&s;t men po&s;&s;e&s;s. It is indeed le&s;s difficult to be indu&s;trious, and by that means to make a wicked action unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding however the old man was thus &s;o frequently preyed on by wicked people, he &s;till continued to live alone. As to any farther lo&s;&s;es, he had one way, he &s;aid, of preventing them; and that was, to keep nothing about him, that was worth &s;tealing. He fa&s;tened therefore the old bolt upon his
<PB N="11" REF="11">door; and went to &s;leep in his lonely cottage as qui|etly, as if he had been in a ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Tho' he had now enough before him, he continued &s;till to live with his u&s;ual frugality. Many of his neighbours thought he might have indulged his age a little more, as he had the means to do it; and as they them&s;elves probably would have done in the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances; by which they might have &s;pent all they had laid up for their old age, not knowing how long God might have lenghtened out their lives. He lived however, as he had been accu&s;tomed to live, in the be&s;t of his days; for in many parts of his life he had been put to &s;hifts. He had always good chee&s;e in his hou&s;e, and good bread, which was his common food, He u&s;ed to brew al&s;o now and then a bu&s;hel of malt; &s;o that he was &s;eldom without a little ca&s;k of beer. His garden produced him plenty of cabbages, which was the only plant he reared: and every year he bought at Lymington fair, a &s;ide of bacon; a bit of which he would, now and then, put into his pot with a cabbage. Fre&s;h meat he never ta&s;ted; nor were butter, and tea, among his nece&s;&s;aries. On this provilion he never had a day's &s;ickne&s;s; and even at tho&s;e times, when his food was le&s;s nouri&s;hing, he was able to do every thing, to which the &s;trength of man is equal.&mdash;What can the art of cookery do more?</P>
<P>He was now near eighty; his limbs began to fail; and he was &s;ubject to rheumatic pains, which &s;eized his right leg; and made exerci&s;e very trouble&s;ome to him. Notwith&s;tanding however this infirmity, and his living a mile from the church, he rarely mi&s;&s;ed taking a painful walk to it every Sunday. The weather mu&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="12">have been very bad to prevent him. And tho' he was now become very deaf, he did not think even that a rea&s;on for keeping from church.&mdash;What an example did he &s;et to tho&s;e, who, tho' in perfect health, in&s;tead of making the &s;abbath a day for obtaining in&s;truction, and begging God's ble&s;&s;ing on the week, profane it by making it a day of pa&s;time, and often a day of drinking, and other wickedne&s;s.&mdash;He was con&s;tant al&s;o at the &s;acrament; which he always e&s;teemed a part of his duty.</P>
<P>He was confined to his hou&s;e about &s;ix weeks before he died. His illne&s;s was a mere decay of nature. His legs &s;welled; and his con&s;titution was broken up. He now &s;ubmitted to have &s;ome|body live in his cottage with him. He was pre&s;&s;ed to &s;end for a phy&s;ician, as he had the means to pay him: but he was re&s;olute again&s;t it. <HI>If you could find me a doctor,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>who would tell me at once, I can do you good&mdash;or I cannot do you good, I would &s;end for him: but el&s;e, why &s;hould I &s;end for a man to be paid for giving me phy&s;ic, when I cannot take victuals?</HI>&mdash;In &s;hort, he knew he was dying, and wi&s;hed to die with as little mole&s;tation as he could.</P>
<P>He kept his bed about three days; and was &s;en&s;ible to the la&s;t. He was in con&s;iderable pain; but he bore it with that firmne&s;s, and manline&s;s, with which he had &s;upported all the hard duties of a con&s;tant life of indu&s;try. He died on the 15th day of May, 1791; and de&s;ired that the 51&s;t p&s;alin might be &s;ung before his corp&s;e, as he was carried through the church-yard to his grave. The thought was new: and the decency, and propriety of it had a good effect.</P>
<P>On his death his effects amounted to about four
<PB N="13" REF="13">hundred pounds. That a man, in the lowe&s;t &s;tation with a con&s;tant attention to money, &s;hould in the cour&s;e of a long life, rai&s;e that &s;um, or a greater, is not wonderful: but that a man in the lowe&s;t &s;tation, &s;hould leave &s;uch a &s;um behind him, after di&s;charging all the offices of life with uprightne&s;s, and propriety, is &s;uch an example of an independent &s;pirit, and of the force of indu&s;try, and frugality, as de&s;erves to be recorded for the benefit of others.&mdash;The following in&s;cription &s;tands over his grave in Boldre church yard.</P>

<BIBL><HI>MAT. XXV. 33.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>IT is the happine&s;s of our religion, that all mankind, poor and rich, are equally able to plea&s;e God. The lowe&s;t may be as acceptable in his Maker's &s;ight, as the highe&s;t: not are any man's &s;ervices &s;o mean, as to be overlooked by his great Ma&s;ter. Before chri&s;tianity indeed, men were apt to think, that &s;uch only as had the powerful means of doing good, could obtain the favour of God&mdash;and that low people could do little
<PB N="14" REF="14">to plea&s;e him. But the go&s;pel informs us, that God does not regard <HI>the action</HI> without <HI>the heart,</HI> from which the action proceeds: and that the <HI>willing mind,</HI> tho' unaccompanied by the action, is as plea&s;ing in God's &s;ight, as the <HI>action it&s;elf.</HI> So that, you &s;ee, the rich and poor are all equally in God's favour. Let each of us only do his duty in his proper &s;tation, <HI>as to the Lord, and not unto man</HI>&mdash;that is, with a de&s;ire to plea&s;e God, who has placed us in our &s;everal &s;tations, and the lowe&s;t of us &s;hall be among&s;t tho&s;e, to whom the text is applied; <HI>Well done, good and faithful &s;ervant: thou ha&s;t been faithful over a few things; I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But now my brethren, among the duties of our &s;e|veral &s;tations, there are &s;ome, which equally belong both to rich, and poor: and there are &s;ome, which belong to one &s;tation rather than the other.&mdash;Let me explain my meaning to you.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e duties, which belong to both, may be reckoned tho&s;e duties, which we owe to God&mdash;love, tru&s;t, reverence, prayer. Such al&s;o are the duties of reading, and meditating on &s;cripture&mdash;of ob&s;erving the &s;abbath&mdash;of faith in our Redeemer&mdash;of attending the Lord's &s;upper. Such al&s;o are humility&mdash;hone&s;ty&mdash;a de&s;ire to &s;erve our neighbour, as far as we can&mdash;the care of our families&mdash;and other duties, that might be mentioned. All the&s;e are equally required from the poor and rich; becau&s;e the poor may perform them as well as the rich.</P>
<P>But there are other duties which are <HI>not thus equall</HI> required. As the rich man abounds in the things of this world, it is required of him to be <HI>generous, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">itable:</HI> becau&s;e God hath enabled him to be &s;o&punc;
<PB N="15" REF="15">But as the poor man cannot be generous and charita|ble, like the rich man; it is rather required of him to be <HI>indu&s;trious</HI> and <HI>frugal.</HI></P>
<P>On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion therefore I &s;hall make the duties of <HI>indu&s;try,</HI> and <HI>frugality</HI> the &s;ubject of my di&s;|cour&s;e. I mention them together, becau&s;e they mu&s;t always keep company, to be of any u&s;e. <HI>Frugality</HI> can do little without <HI>indu&s;try:</HI> and <HI>indu&s;try</HI> as little without <HI>frugality.</HI>&mdash;I &s;hall give you the chief rea&s;ons, which &s;hould incline you to the practice of the&s;e duties.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I would have you con&s;ider what the &s;cripture &s;ays on this &s;ubject. It is often touch|ed upon: but one of the mo&s;t remarkable pa&s;&s;ages, is that of St. Paul to the The&s;&s;alonians. <HI>When we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither &s;hould be eat: for we bear there are &s;ome among you which walk di&s;orderly; working not at all. Now &s;uch we command, and exhort by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that with quietne&s;s they work, and eat their own bread.</HI>&mdash;Now this command that we &s;hould all <HI>eat our own bread,</HI> is plain|ly founded on this rea&s;on, that nobody has a right to eat the bread of others, if he be able to procure his own.&mdash;In &s;ome ca&s;es, no doubt the pari&s;h allowance is a nece&s;&s;ary relief&mdash;as when the father of a family is taken off, while his children are yet young&mdash;or when a family perhaps is greatly vi&s;ited by &s;ickne&s;s&mdash;or when a family is uncommonly large. But how many are there who &s;hamefully run to tho pari&s;h for relief, without any nece&s;&s;ity of this kind? The&s;e are people who either want <HI>indu&s;try</HI> in providing for their fami|lies&mdash;or <HI>frugality,</HI> in not making the be&s;t u&s;e of what they provide. They frequent the ale-hou&s;e; or they &s;pend what they have in good eating; or in other
<PB N="16" REF="16">things, which are not nece&s;&s;ary. Let them con&s;ider, how directly they break a &s;cripture command, by <HI>eat|ing other men's bread for nought;</HI> and by <HI>becoming charge|able</HI> without nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>It may be hoped, that with chri&s;tians a &s;cripture-command may have &s;ufficient weight. However I &s;hall endeaver to &s;hew you more at large, no what <HI>rea&s;on</HI> this <HI>&s;cripture-command</HI> is founded.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, how de&s;irable is it to &s;ee your little habitations as clean, neat, and well furni&s;hed as any of your neighbours&mdash;to &s;ee your children de|cently clothed&mdash;to give them what little education you can&mdash;to have them taught to read, which may be a comfort to them during their lives&mdash;to have them taught to &s;pin, and work, which may give them early habits of diligence. But all this cannot be done with|out great indu&s;try, and frugality in the parent.&mdash;You have a choice therefore before you, whether it is bet|ter to do all this&mdash;at lea&s;t to do it in the be&s;t manner you can&mdash;or to idle away your time; or &s;pend your money in drinking at ale-hou&s;es? How often are the children of idle parents &s;ent to poor-hou&s;es, where their fathers &s;ins are vi&s;ited upon them in all the wretchedne&s;s, mi&s;ery, and neglect, which the poor lit|tle &s;ufferers are too often obliged to undergo.&mdash;Much have tho&s;e parents to an&s;wer for!&mdash;I have my&s;elf heard &s;ome of the&s;e idle parents alledge, that, as they made their money them&s;elves, they had a right to &s;pend it as they plea&s;ed.&mdash;To tell &s;uch people, that no man has a farther right to any thing, which God has given him, than to make a proper u&s;e of it, would be to little purpo&s;e, yet &s;urely they mu&s;t &s;ee the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orce of this, that if they marry, and have families, their a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="17" REF="17">milies &s;hould be con&s;idered as a part of them&s;elves; and have &s;urely a right not only to their maintenance; but to the be&s;t in&s;truction, and care, their parents can be&s;tow. Who is the proper per&s;on to take care of the children, but the parent?</P>
<P>I would have you con&s;ider farther, that <HI>indu&s;try,</HI> and <HI>frugality</HI> are virtues which have a particular tendency to keep you out of the way of temptation, and mi&s;|chief. Where, think you, is lewdne&s;s, and drunken|ne&s;s, and prophanene&s;s, and &s;abbath-breaking, and cur&s;ing, and &s;wearing, and all other wickedne&s;s, be&s;t taught? Its be&s;t &s;chool, I believe, is the ale-hou&s;e. The devil tempts you to be idle fir&s;t and to love drink: then all wickedne&s;s follows naturally. He cannot &s;o ea&s;ily get hold of a frugal, indu&s;trious man. The in|du&s;trious man is otherwi&s;e employed. When the day's labour is over, he wi&s;hes for the night's re&s;t. Between both, he has hardly time to be wicked. I believe, if you would look round your acquaintances, you will find the mo&s;t indu&s;trious, and the mo&s;t frugal people to be al&s;o the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider farther, that <HI>indu&s;try,</HI> and <HI>frugality</HI> rai&s;e your <HI>characters</HI> in the pari&s;h: and give you con&s;equence. You are often inclined to think your&s;elves of more con&s;equence than you really are. You are often ready to take offence, when you hear any little &s;tory told of you, which you think you do not de&s;erve; tho' pro|bably the &s;tory may be very true. All this however &s;hews you wi&s;h to pre&s;erve your characters. But you take the wrong way. It is not believing your&s;elves of con&s;equence; or de&s;iring to &s;top people's mouths, that will give you credit with your neighbours. Leave your neighbours to talk as <HI>they will;</HI> and do you act
<PB N="18" REF="18">as <HI>you ought;</HI> and you need take no farther care about your characters. Hone&s;ty, indu&s;try, and frugality will give character, and con&s;equence to the lowe&s;t among you. He who &s;upports him&s;elf by his own labour, is equal to any body. The riche&s;t man in the country is not more independent. While his idle neighbour, ab|ject and ba&s;e-minded, is pitifully going about begging relief of a pari&s;h-officer; <HI>he</HI> feels his own con&s;equence, and is beholden only to his heavenly Ma&s;ter: he wants no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but God's ble&s;&s;ing, and the u&s;e of his limbs:</P>
<P>La&s;tly, I &s;hould wi&s;h you to con&s;ider, that <HI>indu&s;try,</HI> and <HI>frugality</HI> are the be&s;t means of making you <HI>happy.</HI> I might &s;ay this with regard to the <HI>next</HI> world (for all virtues are generally more or le&s;s linked together) but I am &s;peaking now only of the happine&s;s of this life. With what plea&s;ure may a poor man look round him, and &s;ee all his family out in the world, and by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, doing well through his precepts, and example; and him&s;elf with &s;ome little matter &s;till before him, if God &s;hould lengthen out his time a little longer? There are many ca&s;es, no doubt, where it is impo&s;&s;ible, that any thing can be &s;aved: but in many families, even in this pari&s;h, I know, &s;ome|thing might. If people would only &s;ave what they &s;pend at ale-hou&s;es, or in things unnece&s;&s;ary, &s;ome|thing might be laid by again&s;t a fit of &s;ickne&s;s! or (if God &s;hould ble&s;s them with health) again&s;t old age.&mdash;And is the plea&s;ure, think you, of &s;otting at an ale-hou&s;e equal to this comfortable independence? I know there are many who rea&s;on with them&s;elves that if they can maintain their families, while they are well, it is all they de&s;ire: when they are &s;ick, or old
<PB N="19" REF="19">the pari&s;h is obliged to maintain them. It may be a per&s;on's misfortune to come to the pari&s;h; but when a man in the prime of his &s;trength <HI>rea&s;ons in this way,</HI> I dare take upon me to &s;ay, he is, at the bottom, an idle, good-for-nothing fellow; and his rea&s;oning is only an excu&s;e for drinking, or &s;ome other extrava|gance. In general, &s;uch people go on in a regular progre&s;s to ruin. At fir&s;t they get a love for liquor. They will &s;it whole days, and nights in ale-hou&s;es. They next get into debt. If they have farms to ma|nage, their affairs go wrong. If they are labourers, their families want bread: their children are half-&s;tarved, and half-naked. I need not point out the&s;e people to you; they point out them&s;elves. You &s;ee them loitering about the pari&s;h, languid wretches, with faces &s;odden, pale, and drop&s;ical, the objects equally of pity, and contempt.&mdash;Many, no doubt, fre|quent &s;otting hou&s;es, who have not yet gone this length: but they are in the high way towards it: let them take care in time: <HI>their</HI> ruin is coming on.&mdash;There is no real happine&s;s, my neighbours, you may depend upon it, in &s;uch a life as this. However you may be enticed by the plea&s;ures of idlene&s;s and drinking, (which la&s;t is commonly the beginning of all mi&s;chief) you may be a&s;&s;ured, that all the&s;e things bring their bitter mo|ments; not only <HI>at la&s;t,</HI> but <HI>continually:</HI> and that nothing can make a man &s;o happy, as living in his &s;tation as he ought, with hone&s;ty, &s;obriety, indu&s;try, and fru|gality. No man can live happily, who lives at the will, and under the control of others. The&s;e virtues allow a man to live, independent of others, and in the man|ner he wi&s;hes to live him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Such was the life of our very re&s;pectable neighbour,
<PB N="20" REF="20">who&s;e remains lie before us. His &s;tation in life, you know, was noly that of a common day-labourer: but, as far as I could judge, he &s;et ju&s;t &s;uch an example <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that &s;tation; and behaved exactly, as he ought to have done. He had that generous independent &s;pirit, which I have been recommending to you, that &s;corned to live upon the labours of others; and &s;eemed to lay it down as a principle from the beginning of his life, to be obliged, under God, only to his own labour. By this alone he bred up a large family, without receiv|ing a &s;ingle farthing from the pari&s;h. But this could not have been done without great indu&s;try, and fru|gality. He worked hard; he lived hard: denying him&s;elf every indulgence in eating and drinking, that he might not be a burden to others.&mdash;When his fa|mily was off his hands, he thought, for the &s;ame rea|&s;on, it was proper for him to lay up a little for his old age. While he <HI>could,</HI> therefore, he continued &s;till to work; and lived in the &s;ame hard manner; which was now become quite ea&s;y; and habitual to him.&mdash;It plea&s;ed God to ble&s;s his labour; he laid up &s;o much as maintained him, during his old age; and he has left &s;omething behind him to be a comfort to his children, if they make a right u&s;e of it. He never could be &s;aid to be wholly pa&s;t his labour. Till with|in a few weeks of his death, he every day worked a little; and it became an agreeable amu&s;ement to him. He had, all his life, been u&s;ed to laborious working. Many a time I have heard him &s;ay, that, in general&punc; labourers now did not know what it was to work: and I have heard others &s;ay, who knew him better than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> did, that he would have done as much in one day, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> many people do in two.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="21">I have heard &s;ome of his neighbours tax him with being a mi&s;er, and covetous; and &s;ay, that as he might have lived more comfortably in his old age, his hard living could be owing only to a covetous temper. He might, it is true, have lived more comfortable in his old age, as <HI>they</HI> may think, who accu&s;e him&mdash;and who are fonder of indulgence than he was: but he could not have lived more comfortably to him&s;elf, than he did: and I am per&s;uaded no man had ever le&s;s of the mi&s;er in his heart.&mdash;But let me defend the character of my good old nieghbour in this particular: let me &s;hew you the difference between his temper, and that of a mi&s;er.</P>
<P>A mi&s;er hoards money for <HI>its own &s;ake.</HI> He does not con&s;ider the u&s;e it is to an&s;wer; nor indeed puts it to any u&s;e at all. Hoarding it up is all he has in view. He <HI>loves money.</HI> You remember an in&s;tance of a per&s;on, not many years ago in this pari&s;h, who expired gra&s;p|ing his pur&s;e, under his bed-clothes, to his heart. Per|haps he meant to &s;ecure it, if he &s;hould recover: but it plainly appeared to be his fir&s;t care; and if any &s;hould charge him with a love of money, I &s;hould not know how to defend him.</P>
<P>With covetou&s;ne&s;s, or a love of money, there is often mixed&mdash;indeed, I believe generally, a little knavery. If he who <HI>loves money</HI> do not openly cheat, he has many ways of practi&s;ing little under-hand, dirty tricks, which an unpright man would hardly call ho|ne&s;t.&mdash;I give you the be&s;t &s;ide of him, for the mi&s;er is generally a very wicked character. The apo&s;tle in|deed tells us, that the <HI>love of money is the root of all evil.</HI></P>
<P>Had our worthy, decea&s;ed neighbour, the&s;e &s;igns of a mi&s;er about him? As to his integrity, I dare take upon me to &s;ay, a more upright, hone&s;t man never
<PB N="22" REF="22">lived, Many di&s;hone&s;t practices, I have heard of in the pari&s;h&mdash;many little knavi&s;h tricks, I have &s;een, to take advantages, and get money; but I never heard of one action in the whole, long life of our decea&s;ed neighbour, that was not fair, and hone&s;t, and upright in the highe&s;t degree: and I doubt not, but you can all join with me in bearing this te&s;timony. So far then you will allow, that nothing of the temper of a mi&s;er yet ap|pears.&mdash;How &s;hould there? There was no foundation for it. He had no love for money, merely for its own &s;ake; but as it might be the means of carrying him in|dependently to the end of his life&mdash;and if he did not &s;pend it all, that the remainder might be of &s;ome little u&s;e to his family. I have known him to do what in his circum&s;tances were even generous things. Where he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pend his money, he &s;pent it freely. He lived hard indeed: but whom did that hurt? It enabled him to do many a kind thing: but nobody ever &s;uffered from it, but him&s;elf. It is not <HI>living hard</HI>&mdash;it is not <HI>laying up money,</HI> that makes a man a mi&s;er; but it is the intention, with which he lives hard&mdash;it is the intention with which he lays up mo|ney. Our late neighbour's intention was merely that of an independent &s;pirit, which could not bear to be &s;upported by other people's labour. He lived hard him&s;elf, left, if he had indulged him&s;elf, he &s;hould af|terwards have been obliged to live on the labours of others.&mdash;And is there any thing in this like a love for money? He had no love for money, that interfered I dare take upon me to &s;ay, with any one duty tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> belonged to his &s;tation.&mdash;How little he valued it fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> its own &s;ake, I had many opportunities of &s;eeing, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mo&s;t of his money pa&s;&s;ed through my hands. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="23" REF="23">years ago, you remember his hou&s;e was broken open: he mentioned his lo&s;s to me, not like a mi&s;er; but as far as his money was concerned, with chri&s;tian indif|ference. His chief di&s;tre&s;s was for tho&s;e, who had done the deed. To him, he &s;aid, they had done little injury. By the ble&s;&s;ing of God, he doubted not but he had enough to &s;upport him, while he lived: and it was owing, I believe, more to his lenity, and &s;cru|ples, than to the want of evidence, that the thieves were not convicted. So far from having any thing covetous about him, he appeared always to me en|tirely di&s;engaged from all worldly thoughts; &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of religion; and ready to leave all behind him with the utmo&s;t indifference, and be|gin his great journey to eternity at a moment's warn|ing, whenever it &s;hould plea&s;e God to call him. He u&s;ed to talk of death, ju&s;t as he would of one of the commone&s;t events of life; and left with me a few directions about carrying his body to the grave, with as much indifference as a farmer would give directi|ons about carrying a load of corn to his barn.</P>
<P>Thus, through a very long life he pa&s;&s;ed innocently, religiou&s;ly, inoffen&s;ively, and quietly to that grave, to which we now con&s;ign him.&mdash;Let me earne&s;tly exhort all you, who this day follow his corp&s;e thither, to fol|low al&s;o his example&mdash;that, when it becomes your turn to be brought dead into the church, your neigh|bours may point out your example, as they may his, for others to follow; and apply to you, as I hope we may with ju&s;tice apply to him, <HI>Well done, good and faithful &s;ervant, thou ha&s;t been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</HI></P>
