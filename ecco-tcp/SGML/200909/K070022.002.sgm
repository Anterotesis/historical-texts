</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1558" UNIT="year"> IN a nation divided like the
Engli&s;h, it could &s;carce be expected, that the death of one &s;overeign,
and the acce&s;&s;ion of another, who was &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected to have
embraced oppo&s;ite principles to tho&s;e which prevailed, could be the
&s;ubject of univer&s;al &s;atisfaction: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen's po|pularity.</NOTE> Yet &s;o much were
men di&s;plea&s;ed with the pre&s;ent conduct of affairs, and &s;uch
apprehen&s;ions were entertained of futurity, that the people, overlooking
their theological di&s;putes, expre&s;&s;ed a very general and un&s;eigned joy
that the &s;cepter had pa&s;&s;ed into the hands of Elizabeth. That prince&s;s
had di&s;covered great prudence in her conduct during the reign of her
&s;i&s;ter; and as men were &s;en&s;ible of the imminent danger to which &s;he
was every <PB N="404" REF="5"> moment expo&s;ed, the compa&s;&s;ion towards her
&s;ituation, and concern for her &s;afety, had rendered her, to an uncommon
degree, the favourite of the na|tion. A Parliament had been a&s;&s;embled a few
days before Mary's death; and when Heathe, archbi&s;hop of York, then
chancellor, notified to them that event, &s;carce an interval of regret
appeared; and the two hou&s;es immediately re&s;ounded with the joyful
acclamations of 
<Q REND="inline">"God &s;ave Queen Elizabeth: Long and hap|pily
may &s;he reign."</Q> The people, le&s;s actuated by faction, and le&s;s
influenced by private views, expre&s;&s;ed a joy &s;till more general and
hearty on her proclama|tion; and the au&s;picious commencement of this reign
progno&s;ticated that felicity and glory which, during its whole cour&s;e, &s;o
uniformly attended it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">net, vol. II. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was at Hatfield when &s;he heard of her &s;i&s;ter's
death; and after a few days &s;he proceeded thence to London, thro' crowds of
people, who &s;trove with each other in giving her the &s;tronge&s;t
te&s;timony of their affections. On her entrance into the Tower, &s;he could
not forbear reflecting on the great difference between her pre&s;ent fortune
and that which a few years before had attended her, when &s;he was conducted to
that place as a pri&s;oner, and lay there expo&s;ed to all the bigotted
malignity of her enemies. She fell on her knees, and expre&s;&s;ed her thanks
to heaven, for the deliverance which the Almighty had granted her from her
bloody per&s;ecutors; a deliverance, &s;he &s;aid, no le&s;s miraculous than
that which Daniel had received from the den of lions. This act of pious
gratitude &s;eems to have been the la&s;t circum&s;tance in which &s;he
remembered any pa&s;t inju|ries and hard&s;hips. With a prudence and
magnanimity truly laudable, &s;he bu|ried all offences in oblivion, and
received with a&s;fability even tho&s;e who had acted with the greate&s;t
virulence again&s;t her. Sir Harry Bennifield him&s;elf, to who&s;e cu&s;tody
&s;he had been committed, and who had treated her with uncommon &s;eve|rity,
never felt, during the whole cour&s;e of her reign, any effects of her
re&s;ent|ment<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 374.</NOTE>. Yet was not
the gracious reception which &s;he gave, pro&s;titute and
un|di&s;tingui&s;hing. When the bi&s;hops came in a body to make their
obei&s;ance to her, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed to all of them &s;entiments of regard;
except to Bonner, from whom &s;he turned a&s;ide, as from a man polluted with
blood, who was a ju&s;t ob|ject of horror to every heart &s;u&s;ceptible of
humanity<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Heylin, p. 102.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER employing a few days in ordering her dome&s;tic affairs,
Elizabeth noti|fied to foreign courts, her &s;i&s;ter's death, and her own
acce&s;&s;ion to the crown. She &s;ent lord Cobham to the Low Countries, where
Philip then re&s;ided; and &s;he took care to expre&s;s to that monarch, her
gratitude for the protection which he had a&s;&s;orded her, and her de&s;ire of
pre&s;evering in that friend&s;hip which was &s;o <PB N="405" REF="6"> happily
commenced between them. Philip, who had long fore&s;een this event, and who
&s;till hoped, by means of Elizabeth, to obtain that dominion over Eng|land,
which he had failed of in e&s;pou&s;ing Mary, immediately di&s;patched orders
to the duke of Feria, his amba&s;&s;ador at London, to make propo&s;als of
marriage to the Queen, and he offered to procure from Rome a di&s;pen&s;ation
for that pur|po&s;e. But Elizabeth &s;oon came to the re&s;olution of declining
this propo&s;al. She &s;aw that the nation had entertained an extreme
aver&s;ion to the Spani&s;h alliance during her &s;i&s;ter's reign; and that
one great cau&s;e of the popularity which &s;he her&s;elf enjoyed, was the
pro&s;pect of being freed, by her means, from the danger of foreign
&s;ubjection. She was &s;en&s;ible, that her affinity with Philip, was exactly
&s;imilar to that between her father and Catherine of Arragon; and that her
mar|rying that monarch was, in effect, declaring her&s;elf illegitimate, and
incapable of &s;ucceeding to the throne. And tho' the power of the Spani&s;h
monarchy might &s;till be &s;ufficient, in oppo&s;ition to all pretenders, to
&s;upport her title, her ma&s;culine &s;pirit di&s;dained &s;uch precarious
dominion, which, as it would depend &s;olely on the power of another, mu&s;t be
exerci&s;ed according to his inclination<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">amden in Kennet, p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">. Burnet, vol. II. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">.</NOTE>. But while the&s;e views
prevented her from entertaining any thoughts of a marriage with Philip, &s;he
gave him a very obliging, tho' eva&s;ive, an&s;wer; and he &s;till retained
&s;uch hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, that he &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to Rome, with
orders to &s;ollicit the di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>THE Queen too, on her &s;i&s;ter's death, had wrote to Sir
Edward Carne, the Eng|li&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Rome, to &s;ignify her
acce&s;&s;ion to the pope; but the precipitate nature of Paul broke thro' all
the cautious mea&s;ures concerted by that young prince&s;s. He told Carne, that
England was a &s;ief of the holy &s;ee; and it was a great temerity in her to
have a&s;&s;umed, without his participation, the title and authority of Queen:
That Elizabeth, being illegitimate, could not po&s;&s;ibly in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">it that kingdom; nor could he annul the
&s;entence pronounced by Clement the &s;eventh, and Paul the third, with regard
to Henry's marriage: That were he to proceed with rigour, he would puni&s;h
this criminal inva&s;ion of his rights, by rejecting all her applications; but
being willing to treat her with paternal indul|gence, he would &s;till keep the
door of grace open to her: And that if &s;he would renounce all preten&s;ions
to the throne, and &s;ubmit entirely to his will, &s;he &s;hould experience the
utmo&s;t lenity which was compatible with the dignity of the apo&s;|tolic
&s;ee<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>. When this an&s;wer was reported to Elizabeth, &s;he was
a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oni&s;hed at the character of
that aged pontiff; and having recalled her a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e con|tinued with more determined
re&s;olution to pur&s;ue tho&s;e mea&s;ures which the had already &s;ecretly
embraced.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="7"> THE Queen, not to alarm the partizans of
the catholic religion, had retained eleven of her &s;i&s;ter's councellors; but
in order to ballance their authority, &s;he added eight more who were known to
be affectionate to the prote&s;tant commu|nion: The marquis of Northampton, the
earl of Bedford, Sir Thomas Parry, Sir Edward Rogers, Sir Ambro&s;e Cave, Sir
Francis Knolles, Sir Nicholas Bacon, whom &s;he created lord keeper, and Sir
William Cecil, &s;ecretary of &s;tate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Ann.
vol. I. p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the prote&s;tant
religion.</NOTE> With the&s;e coun&s;ellors, particularly Cecil, &s;he
frequently deliberated concerning the expediency of re&s;toring the
prote&s;tant religion, and the means of executing that great enterprize. Cecil
told her, that the greate&s;t part of the nation had, ever &s;ince her father's
reign, inclined to the reformation; and tho' her &s;i&s;ter had con|&s;trained
them to profe&s;s the ancient faith, the cruelties exerci&s;ed by her
mini&s;ters, had &s;till more alienated their affections from it: That happily
the intere&s;ts of the &s;overeign concurred here with the inclinations of the
people; nor was her title to the crown compatible with the authority of the
Roman pontiff: That a &s;entence, &s;o &s;olemnly pronounced by two popes
again&s;t her mother's marriage, could not po&s;&s;ibly be recalled, without
inflicting a mortal wound on the credit of the &s;ee of Rome; and even if &s;he
was allowed to retain the crown, it would only be on an uncertain and dependant
footing: That this motive counterballanced all dan|gers whatever; and the&s;e
dangers them&s;elves, if narrowly viewed, would be found very little
formidable: That the cur&s;es and execrations of the Romi&s;h church, when not
&s;econded by military force, were, in the pre&s;ent age, more an object of
ridicule than of terror, and had now as little influence in this world as in
the next: That tho' the bigotry or ambition of Henry or Philip might in|cline
them to execute a &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t her, their
intere&s;ts were &s;o incompatible, that they never could concur in any plan of
operations; and the enmity of the one would always en&s;ure to her the
friend&s;hip of the other: That if they encouraged the di&s;contents of her
catholic &s;ubjects, their dominions al&s;o abounded with prote&s;tants, and it
would be ea&s;y to retaliate that injury upon them: That even &s;uch of the
Engli&s;h as &s;eemed at pre&s;ent zealou&s;ly attached to the catholic faith,
would mo&s;t of them embrace the religion of their new &s;ove|reign; and the
nation had of late been &s;o accu&s;tomed to the&s;e revolutions, that men had
lo&s;t all idea of truth and fal&s;ehood in &s;uch &s;ubjects: That the
authority of Henry the eighth, &s;o highly rai&s;ed by many concurring
circum&s;tances, fir&s;t enured the people to this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive deference;
and it was more ea&s;y for the &s;uc|ceeding princes to continue the nation in
a train to which it had been &s;o long ac|cu&s;tomed: And that it would be
ea&s;y for her, by be&s;towing on prote&s;tants all <PB N="407" REF="8"> the
commi&s;&s;ions in civil offices and the militia, the church and the
univer&s;ities, both to en&s;ure her own authority, and to render her religion
entirely predo|minant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 377. Camden,
p. 370.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE education of Elizabeth, as well as her intere&s;t, led her
to favour the re|formation; and &s;he remained not long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e with
regard to the party, which &s;he &s;hould embrace: But tho' determined in her
own mind, &s;he re&s;olved to proceed by gradual and &s;ecure &s;teps, and not
to imitate the example of Mary, in encouraging the bigots of her party to make
immediately a violent inva&s;ion on the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 378. Camden, p. 371</NOTE>. She
thought it requi&s;ite, however, to di&s;cover &s;uch &s;ymptoms of her
intentions, as might give encouragement to the prote|&s;tants, &s;o much
depre&s;&s;ed by the late violent per&s;ecution. She immediately re|called all
the exiles, and gave liberty to the pri&s;oners who were confined on ac|count
of religion. We are told of a plea&s;antry of one Rainsford on this
occa|&s;ion, who &s;aid to the Queen, that he had a petition to pre&s;ent her
in behalf of other pri&s;oners called Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John: She
readily replied, that it behoved her fir&s;t to con&s;ult the pri&s;oners
them&s;elves, and to learn of them whether they de&s;ired that liberty, which
he demanded for them<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 103.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH al&s;o proceeded to exert, in favour of the reformers,
&s;ome acts of power, which were con&s;i&s;tent with the extent of the royal
prerogative during that age. Finding, that the prote&s;tant teachers, irritated
by per&s;ecution, broke out in a furious attack of the antient
&s;uper&s;tition, and that the Romani&s;ts replied with no le&s;s zeal and
acrimony, &s;he publi&s;hed a proclamation, by which &s;he prohibited all
preaching without a &s;pecial licence<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p.
104. Strype, vol. I. p. 41.</NOTE>; and tho' &s;he di&s;pen&s;ed with this
prohibition in favour of &s;ome preachers of her own &s;ect, &s;he took care,
that they &s;hould be the mo&s;t calm and moderate of the party. She al&s;o
&s;u&s;|pended the laws &s;o far as to order a great part of the &s;ervice; the
litany, the Lord's prayer, the creed, and the go&s;pels; to be read in
Engli&s;h. And having fir&s;t publi&s;hed injunctions, that all the churches
&s;hould conform them&s;elves to the practice of her own chappel, &s;he forbade
the ho&s;te to be any more elevated in her pre&s;ence; an innovation, which,
however frivolous it may appear, implied the mo&s;t material
con&s;equences<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.

<P>THESE declarations of her intention, concurring with the
preceding &s;u&s;picions, made the bi&s;hops fore&s;ee with certainty a
revolution in religion. They there|fore refu&s;ed to officiate at her
coronation; and it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> with &s;ome
difficulty, that the <PB N="408" REF="9"> bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le was at la&s;t
prevailed on to perform that ceremony. When &s;he was conducted thro' London,
amid&s;t the joyful acclamations of her &s;ubjects, a boy, who per&s;onated
truth, was let down from one of the triumphal arches, and pre|&s;ented her with
a copy of the Bible. She received the book with the mo&s;t gra|cious
deportment, placed it next her bo&s;om, and declared, that, amid&s;t all the
co&s;tly te&s;timonies which the city had that day given of their attachment,
this pre&s;ent was by far the mo&s;t precious and mo&s;t acceptable<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> vol.
II. p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> vol. I. p. 9.</NOTE>.
Such were the in|nocent artifices, by which Elizabeth in&s;inuated her&s;elf
into the affections of her &s;ubjects. Open in her addre&s;s, gracious and
affable in all public appearances, &s;he rejoiced in the concour&s;e of her
&s;ubjects, entered into all their plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements, and without
departing from her dignity, which &s;he knew well how to pre&s;erve, &s;he
acquired a popularity beyond what any of her predece&s;&s;ors or
&s;ucce&s;|&s;ors ever could attain. Her own &s;ex exulted to &s;ee a woman
hold the reins of empire with &s;uch prudence and fortitude: And while a young
prince&s;s of twenty-five years (for that was her age at her acce&s;&s;ion) who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the graces and in&s;inuation, tho' not all the beauty of
her &s;ex, courted the affections of indivi|duals by her civilities, of the
public by her &s;ervices, her authority, tho' corro|borated by the
&s;tricte&s;t bands of law and religion, appeared to be derived en|tirely from
the choice and inclination of the people.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1559" UNIT="year"> A SOVEREIGN of this

<P>THE fir&s;t bill which was brought into the Parliament with a
view of trying their di&s;po&s;ition with regard to religion, was that for
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing the mona&s;teries lately erected, and for re&s;toring the
tenths and fir&s;t-fruits to the Queen. This point being gained without much
difficulty, a bill was next introduced, annexing the &s;upremacy to the crown;
and tho' the Queen was there denominated <HI>governe&s;s,</HI> not
<HI>head,</HI> of the church, it conveyed the &s;ame exten&s;ive power, which
had formerly been exerci&s;ed by her father and brother. All the bi&s;hops who
were pre&s;ent in the upper hou&s;e &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed this law; and as
they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more learning than the temporal peers, they triumphed in
the argument; but the majority of voices in that hou&s;e, as well as among the
commons, were again&s;t them. By this act the crown, without the concurrence,
either of the Parliament or even of the convocation, was ve&s;ted with the
whole &s;piritual power; might repre&s;s all here|&s;ies<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In determining here&s;y, the crown was only limited (if that could

exerci&s;e this unlimited authority, the Queen, by a clau&s;e of the act, was
empowered to name commi&s;&s;ioners, either laymen or clergymen, as &s;he
&s;hould think proper; and on this clau&s;e was afterwards founded the court of
eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion; which a&s;&s;umed very large
di&s;cretionary, not to &s;ay arbitrary powers, totally incompatible with any
exact limitations in the con&s;titution. Their proceedings indeed were only
con&s;i&s;tent with ab&s;olute monarchy; but were entirely &s;uitable to the
genius of the act on which they were e&s;tabli&s;hed; an act that at once gave
the crown all the power, which had formerly been claimed by the popes, but
which even the&s;e u&s;urping prelates had never been able fully to exerci&s;e,
without &s;ome con|currence of the clergy.</P>

the third offence was declared trea&s;on. The&s;e puni&s;hments, however
&s;evere, were le&s;s rigorous than &s;uch as were formerly, during the reigns
of her father and brother, inflicted in like ca&s;es.</P>
<P>A LAW was pa&s;&s;ed, confirming all the &s;tatutes enacted in
King Edward's time with regard to religion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>: The nomination
of bi&s;hops was given to the crown without any election of the chapters: The
Queen was empowered, on the va|cancy of any &s;ee, to &s;eize all the
temporalities, and to be&s;tow on the bi&s;hops-elect an equivalent in the
impropriations belonging to the crown. This pretended equivalent was commonly
very much inferior in value; and thus the Queen, amid&s;t all her concern for
religion, followed the example of the preceding re|formers, in committing
depredations on the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues.</P>
<P>THE bi&s;hops and all incumbents were prohibited from alienating
their reve|nues, and from letting lea&s;es longer than twenty-one years or
three lives. This law &s;eemed to be intended for &s;ecuring the property of
the church; but as an exception was left in favour of the crown, great abu&s;es
&s;till prevailed. It was u&s;ual for a courtier, during this reign, to make a
tran&s;action with a bi&s;hop or incumbent; and to procure a &s;ham alienation
to the Queen, who afterwards transferred the lands to the per&s;on agreed
on<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 79.</NOTE>. This method of
pillaging the church was not remedied till the beginning of James the fir&s;t.
The pre&s;ent de|pre&s;&s;ion of the clergy expo&s;ed them to all injuries; and
the laity never &s;topped till they had reduced the church to &s;uch poverty,
that her plunder was no longer a compen&s;ation for the odium incurred by
it.</P>
<P>A SOLEMN and public di&s;putation was held during this
&s;e&s;&s;ion, in pre&s;ence of lord keeper Bacon, between the divines of the
prote&s;tant and tho&s;e of the catholic party. The champions appointed to
defend the religion of the &s;overeign, were, as in former in&s;tances,
entirely triumphant, and the popi&s;h di&s;putants, being pronounced refractory
and ob&s;tinate, were even puni&s;hed by impri&s;onment<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 95.</NOTE>. Emboldened by this victory, the
prote&s;tants ventured on the la&s;t and mo&s;t important &s;tep, and brought
into Parliament a bill<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>
for aboli&s;hing the ma&s;s, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the liturgy of King
Edward. Penalties were enacted, as well again&s;t tho&s;e who departed from
this mode of wor&s;hip, as tho&s;e who ab&s;ented them&s;elves from the church
and the &s;acraments. And thus in one &s;e&s;&s;ion, without any violence, 
<PB N="411" REF="12"> tumult, or clamour, was the whole &s;y&s;tem of religion
altered, on the very com|mencement of a reign, and by the will of a young
woman, who&s;e title to the crown was by many e&s;teemed liable to great
objections: An event, which, tho' it may appear &s;urprizing to men in the
pre&s;ent age, was every where expected on the fir&s;t news of her
acce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE commons al&s;o made a &s;acrifice to the Queen more
difficult to obtain than that of any articles of religion: They voted a
&s;ub&s;idy of four &s;hillings in the pound on land, and two &s;hillings and
eight pence on goods, together with two fifteenths<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The
Parliament al&s;o granted the Queen the duties of tonnage and poundage; but
this conce&s;&s;ion was at that time regarded only as a matter of form, and
&s;he had levied the&s;e duties before they were voted by the Parliament: But
there was another exertion of power, which &s;he practi&s;ed, and which people,
in this age, from their ignorance of the antient con&s;titution, may be apt to
think a little extraordinary. Her &s;i&s;ter, after the commencement of the war
with France, had, from her own authority, impo&s;ed four marks on each ton of
wine imported, and had encrea&s;ed the poundage a third on ail commodities.
Queen Elizabeth continued the&s;e impo&s;itions as long as &s;he thought
convenient. The Parliament, who had &s;o good an opportunity of re&s;training
the&s;e arbitrary taxes, when they voted the tonnage and poundage, thought
proper not to make any mention of them. They knew, that the &s;overeign, during
that age, pretended to have the &s;ole regulation of foreign trade, and that
their intermed lling with that prerogative would have drawn on them the
&s;evere&s;t reproof, if not cha&s;ti&s;ement. See Forbes vol. I. p. 132, 133.
We know certainly from the &s;tatutes and journals, that no &s;uch
unpo&s;itions were granted by Parliament.</NOTE>. The hou&s;e in no in&s;tance
departed from the mo&s;t re&s;pectful deference and complai&s;ance towards the
Queen. Even the importunate addre&s;s, which they made her on the conclu&s;ion
of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, to fix her choice of a hu&s;band, could not, they
&s;uppo&s;ed, be very di&s;agreeable to one of her &s;ex and age. The addre&s;s
was couched in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful expre&s;&s;ions; yet met with a
refu&s;al from the Queen. She told the &s;peaker, that as the application from
the hou&s;e was conceived in general terms, only recommending marriage, without
pretend|ing to direct her choice of a hu&s;band, &s;he could not take offence
at the addre&s;s, or regard it as other than a new in&s;tance of their
affectionate attachment towards her: That any farther interpo&s;al on their
part would have ill become either them to make, as &s;ubjects, or her to hear
as an independant prince&s;s: That even while &s;he was a private per&s;on, and
expo&s;ed to much danger, &s;he had always declined that engagement, which
&s;he regarded as an incumbrance; much more, at pre|&s;ent would &s;he
per&s;evere in that &s;entiment, when the charge of a great kingdom was
committed to her, and her life ought to be entirely dedicated to promoting the
intere&s;ts of religion and the happine&s;s of her &s;ubjects: That as England
was her hu&s;band, wedded to her by this pledge (and here &s;he &s;hewed them
her &s;inger with the &s;ame gold ring upon it, with which &s;he had &s;olemnly
betrothed her&s;elf <PB N="412" REF="13"> to the kingdom at her inauguration)
&s;o all Engli&s;hmen were her children; and while &s;he was employed in the
rearing or governing &s;uch a family, &s;he could not e&s;teem her&s;elf
barren, or her life u&s;ele&s;s and unfruitful: That if &s;he ever en|tertained
thoughts of changing her condition, the care of her &s;ubjects welfare would
&s;till be uppermo&s;t in her thoughts; but &s;hould &s;he live and die a
virgin, &s;he doubted not but the divine providence, &s;econded by their
coun&s;els and her own mea&s;ures, would be able to prevent all di&s;pute with
regard to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and &s;ecure them a &s;overeign, who, perhaps
better than her own i&s;&s;ue, would imitate her example in loving and
cheri&s;hing her people: And that for her part, &s;he de&s;ired that no higher

fourteen by a very &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on, which preceded; and all of the&s;e,
except the bi&s;hop of Landaffe, having refu&s;ed compliance, were degraded

honour in their per&s;everance; but on the whole, the prote&s;tants, in the
former change in|troduced by Mary, appear to have been much more rigid and
con&s;cientious. Tho' the catholic religion, adapting it&s;elf to the
&s;en&s;es, and requiring ob&s;ervances, which enter into the common train of
life, does at pre&s;ent lay much fa&s;ter hold of the mind than the reformed,
which, being chiefly &s;piritual, re&s;embles more a &s;y&s;tem of
metaphy&s;ics; yet was the proportion of zeal, as well as of knowlege, during
the fir&s;t ages after the reformation, much greater on the &s;ide of the
pro|te&s;tants. The catholics continued, ignorantly and &s;upinely, in their
antient be|lief, or rather their antient practices: But the reformers, obliged
to di&s;pute on every <PB N="413" REF="14"> occa&s;ion, and enflamed to a
degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m by novelty and per&s;ecution, had &s;trongly attached
them&s;elves to their tenets; and were ready to &s;acrifice their fortunes and
even their lives, in defence of their &s;peculative and ab&s;tract prin|ciples.
The forms and ceremonies, &s;till pre&s;erved in the Engli&s;h liturgy, as they
bore &s;ome re&s;emblance to the antient &s;ervice, tended farther to reconcile
the catho|lics to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion; and as the Queen permitted no

with the people, would have been &s;till more &s;imilar between the new and the
antient form of wor&s;hip. As &s;he loved &s;tate and magnificence in every

con&s;ulting with her mini&s;ters, very wi&s;ely rejected this propo&s;al. She
was &s;en&s;ible of the low &s;tate of her finances; the great debts contracted
by her father, brother, and &s;i&s;ter; the di&s;orders introduced into every
part of <PB N="414" REF="15"> the admini&s;tration; the divi&s;ions by which
her people were agitated; and &s;he was convinced that nothing but tranquillity
during &s;ome years could bring the kingdom again into a flouri&s;hing
condition, or enable her to act with dignity and vigour, in her tran&s;actions
with foreign nations. Well acquainted with the value which Henry put upon
Calais, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of recovering it by treaty during the
pre&s;ent emergency, &s;he was willing rather to &s;uffer that lo&s;s, than
&s;ubmit to &s;uch a dependance on Spain, as &s;he mu&s;t expect to fall into,
if &s;he continued pertinaciou&s;ly in her pre&s;ent demand. She ordered,
therefore, her am|ba&s;&s;adors, the lord Effingham, the bi&s;hop of Ely, and
Dr. Wotton, to conclude the negociation, and to &s;ettle a peace with Henry, or
any rea&s;onable terms. Henry offered to &s;tipulate a marriage between the
elde&s;t daughter of the dauphin, and the elde&s;t &s;on of Elizabeth; and to
engage for the re&s;titution of Calais as the dowry of that prince&s;s<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. I. p. 54.</NOTE>; but as the Queen was
&s;en&s;ible that this treaty would appear to the world a palpable eva&s;ion,
&s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon more equitable, at lea&s;t, more plau&s;ible
conditions. It was at la&s;t agreed, that Henry &s;hould re&s;tore Ca|lais at
the expiration of eight years; that in ca&s;e of failure, he &s;hould pay five
hundred thou&s;and crowns, and the Queen's title to Calais &s;till remain; that
he &s;hould find the &s;ecurity of &s;even or eight foreign merchants, not
natives of France, for the payment of this &s;um; that he &s;hould deliver five
ho&s;tages till that &s;ecurity was provided; that if Elizabeth broke the peace
with France or Scotland during that interval, &s;he &s;hould forfeit all title
to Calais; but if Henry made war on Elizabeth, he &s;hould be obliged
immediately to re&s;tore that for|tre&s;s<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.
p. 68. Rymer, tom XV. p. 505.</NOTE>. Every per&s;on of penetration ea&s;ily
&s;aw, that the&s;e &s;tipulations were but a colourable pretence for
abandoning Calais; but they excu&s;ed the Queen on ac|count of the
nece&s;&s;ity of her affairs, and they even extolled her prudence, in
&s;ub|mitting, without farther &s;truggle, to that nece&s;&s;ity. A peace with
Scotland was a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of that with France.</P>
<P>PHILIP and Henry concluded ho&s;tilities with a mutual
re&s;titution of all places taken during the cour&s;e of the war; and Philip
e&s;pou&s;ed the prince&s;s Elizabeth, elde&s;t daughter of France, formerly
betrothed to his &s;on Don Carlos. The duke of Savoy married Margaret, Henry's
&s;i&s;ter, and obtained a re&s;titution of all his dominions of Savoy and

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;gu&s;t be|tween the Queen, and Mary
Queen of Scots.</NOTE> BUT tho' a peace was &s;igned and concluded between
France and England, there &s;oon appeared a ground of quarrel, of the mo&s;t
&s;erious nature, and which was afterwards attended with the mo&s;t important
con&s;equences. The two mar|riages <PB N="415" REF="16"> of Henry the eighth,
that with Catherine of Arragon, and that with Anne Bo&s;eyn, were totally
incompatible with each other, and it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible that both of them
could be regarded as valid and legal: But &s;till the birth of Elizabeth lay
under &s;ome di&s;advantages, to which that of her &s;i&s;ter, Mary, was not
expo&s;ed. Henry's fir&s;t marriage had obtained the &s;anction of all the
powers, both civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, which were then acknowleged in
England; and it was natural, for prote&s;tants as well as Romani&s;ts, to
allow, on account of the &s;incere intention of the parties, that their
i&s;&s;ue ought to be regarded as legitimate. But his divorce, and &s;econd
marriage, had been concluded in direct oppo&s;ition to the &s;ee of Rome; and
tho' they had been ratified by the authority both of the Engli&s;h Parliament
and convocation, tho&s;e who were &s;trongly attached to the ca|tholic church,
and who rea&s;oned with great &s;trictne&s;s, were led to regard them as
entirely invalid, and to deny altogether the Queen's right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.
The next heir of blood was the Queen of Scots, now married to the dauphin; and
the great power of that prince&s;s, joined to her plau&s;ible title, rendered
her a very formidable rival to Elizabeth. The King of France had &s;ecretly
been &s;olliciting at Rome a bull of excommunication again&s;t the Queen; and
&s;he had here been beholden to the good offices of Philip, who, from
intere&s;t more than either friend&s;hip or principle, had negociated in her
favour, and had &s;ucce&s;sfully oppo&s;ed the preten&s;ions of Henry. But the
court of France was not di&s;couraged with this repul&s;e: The duke of Gui&s;e,
and his brothers, thinking, that it would much augment their credit, if their
niece &s;hould bring an acce&s;&s;ion of England, as &s;he had already done of
Scotland, to the crown of France, engaged the King not to neglect the claim;
and, by their per&s;ua&s;ion, he ordered his &s;on and daughter-in-law to
a&s;&s;ume openly the arms as well as title of England, and to quarter the&s;e
arms on all their equipages, furniture, and liveries. When the Engli&s;h
amba&s;|&s;ador complained of this injury, he could obtain nothing but an
eva&s;ive an&s;wer; that as the Queen of Scots was de&s;cended from the blood
royal of England, &s;he was entitled, by the example of many princes, to
a&s;&s;ume the arms of that king|dom. But be&s;ides that this practice had
never prevailed without permi&s;&s;ion be|ing fir&s;t obtained, and without
making a vi&s;ible difference between the arms, Elizabeth plainly &s;aw, that
this preten&s;ion had not been advanced during the reign of her &s;i&s;ter
Mary; and that, therefore, the King of France intended, on the fir&s;t
opportunity, to di&s;pute her legitimacy, and her title to the crown. Alarmed
with the danger, &s;he thenceforth conceived a &s;trong jealou&s;y again&s;t
the Queen of Scots; and was determined, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to incapacitate
Henry from the execution of his project. The &s;udden death of that monarch,
who was killed in a tournament at Paris, while he was celebrating the
e&s;pou&s;als of his <PB N="416" REF="17"> &s;i&s;ter with the duke of Savoy,
altered not her views. Being informed, that his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Francis the
&s;econd, &s;till continued to a&s;&s;ume, without re&s;erve, the title of King
of England, &s;he began to con&s;ider him and his Queen as her mo&s;t mor|tal
enemies; and the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs in Scotland afforded her a
fa|vourable opportunity, both of revenging the injury and of providing for her
own &s;afety.</P>

di&s;po&s;ed to &s;acrifice the civil intere&s;ts of the &s;tate to the bigotry
or intere&s;ts of prie&s;ts, &s;he e&s;teemed it more expedient to temporize,
and to connive at the pro|gre&s;s of a doctrine which &s;he had not power
entirely to repre&s;s. When informed of the death of Edward, and the
acce&s;&s;ion of Mary to the crown of England, &s;he entertained hopes, that
the Scotti&s;h reformers, deprived of the countenance which they received from
that powerful kingdom, would lo&s;e their ardour with their pro&s;pect of
&s;ucce&s;s, and would gradually return to the faith of their an|ce&s;tors. But
the progre&s;s and revolutions of religion are little governed by the u&s;ual
maxims of civil policy; and the event much di&s;appointed the regent's
ex|pectations. Many of the Engli&s;h preachers, terrified with the &s;everity
of Mary's government, took &s;helter in Scotland, where they found more
protection, and a milder admini&s;tration; and while they propagated their
theological tenets, they filled that whole kingdom with a ju&s;t horror
again&s;t the cruelties of the bigoted catholics, and &s;howed their
di&s;ciples the fate which they mu&s;t expect, if ever their adver&s;aries
&s;hould attain an uncontrouled authority over them.</P>
<P>A HIERARCHY, moderate in its acqui&s;itions of power and riches,
may &s;afely grant a toleration to &s;ectaries; and the more it abates the
fervor of innovators by lenity and liberty, the more &s;ecurely will it
po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e advantages which the legal e&s;tabli&s;hments be&s;tow
upon it. But where &s;uper&s;tition has rai&s;ed a church to &s;uch an
exorbitant height as that of Rome, per&s;ecution is le&s;s the re&s;ult of
bi|gotry in the prie&s;ts, than of a nece&s;&s;ary policy; and the rigour of
law is the only method of repelling the attacks of men, who, be&s;ides
religious zeal, have &s;o many other motives, derived both from public and
private intere&s;t, to engage them on the &s;ide of innovation. But tho' &s;uch
overgrown hierarchies may long &s;upport them&s;elves by the&s;e violent
expedients, the time comes, when &s;everities tend only to enrage the new
&s;ectaries, and make them break thro' all bounds of rea&s;on and moderation.
This cri&s;is was now vi&s;ibly approaching in Scotland; and 
<PB N="417" REF="18"> whoever con&s;iders merely the tran&s;actions re&s;ulting
from it, will be inclined to throw the blame equally on both parties; whoever
enlarges his view, and reflects on the &s;ituations, will ob&s;erve the

principles which are inherent in human nature.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reformation in Scotland.</NOTE> SOME heads of
the reformers in Scotland, &s;uch as the earl of Argyle, his &s;on lord Lorne,
the earls of Morton, and Glencarne, Er&s;kine of Dun, and others, finding the
danger to which they were expo&s;ed, and de&s;irous to propagate their

them&s;elves the <HI>Congregation</HI> of the Lord, in contradi&s;tinction to
the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, which they denominated the Congregation of Satan.
The tenor of the bond was as follows: 
<Q REND="inline">"We, perceiving how Satan, in his members, the
antichri&s;ts of our time, do cruelly rage, &s;eeking to overthrow and to

<P>HAD the &s;ub&s;cribers of this zealous league been contented
only to demand a toleration of the new opinions; however incompatible their
preten&s;ions might have been with the policy of the church of Rome, they would
have had the prai&s;e of oppo&s;ing tyrannical laws, enacted to &s;upport an
e&s;tabli&s;hment prejudicial to civil &s;ociety: But it is plain, that they
carried their views much farther; and their practice immediately di&s;covered
the &s;pirit by which they were actuated. Supported by the authority which,
they thought, belonged to them as the con|gregation <PB N="418" REF="19"> of
the Lord, they ordained, that prayers in the vulgar tongue<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The reformers u&s;ed at that time King Edward's liturgy in

bonds of a&s;&s;ociation are always the forerunners of rebellion; and this
vio|lent inva&s;ion of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion was the actual commencement
of it.</P>
<P>BEFORE this league was publicly known or avowed, the clergy,
alarmed with the progre&s;s of the reformation, attempted to recover their
lo&s;t authority, by a violent exerci&s;e of power, which tended &s;till
farther to augment the zeal and number of their enemies. Hamilton, the primate,
&s;eized Walter Mill, a prie&s;t of an irreproachable life, who had embraced
the new doctrines; and having tried him at St. Andrews, condemned him to the
flames for here&s;y. Such general aver&s;ion was di&s;covered to this
barbarity, that it was &s;ome time before the bi&s;hops could prevail on any
one to act the part of a civil judge, and pronounce the &s;en|tence upon him;
and even after the time of his execution was fixed, all the &s;hops of St.
Andrews being &s;hut, no one would &s;ell a rope to tie him to the &s;take, and
the primate him&s;elf was obliged to furni&s;h this implement. The man bore the
torture with that courage which, tho' u&s;ual on the&s;e occa&s;ions, always
ap|pears a&s;toni&s;hing and &s;upernatural to the multitude: The people, to
expre&s;s their abhorrence again&s;t the cruelty of the prie&s;ts, rai&s;ed a
monument of &s;tones on the place of his execution; and as fa&s;t as the
&s;tones were removed by order of the clergy, they were again &s;upplied from
the voluntary zeal of the populace<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Knox, p.
122.</NOTE>. It is vain for men to oppo&s;e the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hments to
the united principles of reli|gion and public applau&s;e; and this was the
la&s;t barbarity of the kind which the catholics had the power to exerci&s;e in
Scotland.</P>
<P>SOME time after, the people di&s;covered their &s;entiments in
&s;uch a manner as was &s;ufficient to progno&s;ticate to the prie&s;ts, the
fate which was awaiting them. It was u&s;ual on the fe&s;tival of St. Giles,
the tutelar &s;aint of Edinburgh, to carry in proce&s;&s;ion the image of that
&s;aint; but the prote&s;tants, in order to prevent the ceremony, found means,
on the eve of the fe&s;tival, to purloin the &s;tatue from the church, and they
plea&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> them&s;elves with
imagining the a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;appointment of his votaries. The
clergy, however, &s;ramed ha&s;tily a new image, which, in deri&s;ion, was
called by the people young St. Giles; and they carried it thro' the &s;treets,
attended with all the eccle&s;ia&s;tics in the town and neighbourhood. The
multitude ab&s;tained from violence &s;o long as the Queen|regent 
<PB N="419" REF="20"> continued a &s;pectator, but the moment &s;he retired,
they invaded the idol, threw it in the dirt, and broke it in pieces. The flight
and terror of the prie&s;ts and fryars, who, it was remarked, de&s;erted, in
his greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, the object of their wor&s;hip, was the &s;ource of
univer&s;al mockery and laughter.</P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by all the&s;e appearances, the congregation
proceeded with ala|crity in openly &s;olliciting &s;ub&s;criptions to their
league; and the death of Mary of England, with the acce&s;&s;ion of Elizabeth,
which happened about this time, contributed much to increa&s;e their hopes of
final &s;ucce&s;s in their undertaking. They ventured to pre&s;ent a petition
to the regent, craving a reformation of the church, and of the <HI>wicked,
&s;candalous,</HI> and <HI>dete&s;table</HI> lives of the prelates and
ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 121.</NOTE>. They applied
to the Parliament, by a petition, in which, after pre|mi&s;ing, that they could
not communicate with the damnable idolatry, and into|lerable abu&s;es of the
papi&s;tical church, they de&s;ired, that the laws again&s;t here|tics &s;hould
be executed by the civil magi&s;trate alone, and that the &s;cripture &s;hould
be the &s;ole rule for judging of here&s;y<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.
p. 123.</NOTE>. They even petitioned the convocation, and in&s;i&s;ted that
prayers &s;hould be &s;aid in the vulgar tongue, and that bi&s;hops &s;hould be
cho&s;en with the con&s;ent of the gentry of the dioce&s;e, and prie&s;ts with

and as &s;he aimed at procuring a matrimonial crown for her &s;on-in|law, the

extremities with either of them.</P>
<P>BUT after this conce&s;&s;ion was obtained, &s;he received

again&s;t the clergy of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion.</P>
<P>IN this critical time John Knox arrived from Geneva, where he
had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years in bani&s;hment, and where he had imbibed, from his
commerce with Calvin, the highe&s;t fanatici&s;m of his &s;ect, augmented by
the natural ferocity of his own character. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th May.</NOTE> He had been invited back to
Scotland by the leaders of the reformation; and mounting the pulpit at Perth,
during the pre&s;ent ferment of mens minds, he declaimed with his u&s;ual
vehemence again&s;t the idolatry and other abominations of the church of Rome,
and incited his audience to exert their ut|mo&s;t zeal for its &s;ubver&s;ion.
A prie&s;t was &s;o imprudent, after this &s;ermon, as to open his repo&s;itory
of images and relicts, and prepare him&s;elf to &s;ay ma&s;s. The audience, who
were wrought up to a di&s;po&s;ition for any furious enterprize, were as much
enraged as if the &s;pectacle had not been quite familiar to them: They
attacked the prie&s;t with fury, broke the images in pieces, tore the pictures,
overthrew the altars, &s;cattered about the &s;acred va&s;es; and le&s;t no
implement of idolatrous wor&s;hip, as they called it, entire or unbroken. They
thence proceeded with additional numbers, and augmented rage, to the
mona&s;teries of the Grey and Black friars, which they pillaged in an
in&s;tant: The Carthu&s;ians underwent the &s;ame fate; and the populace, not
content with robbing and expelling the monks, vented their fury on the
buildings, which had been the recepticles of &s;uch abomination; and in a very
little time nothing but the walls of the&s;e &s;tately edifices were left
&s;tanding. The inhabitants of Couper in Fife &s;oon after imi|tated the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars in Scotland.</NOTE> THE
Queen-regent, provoked at the&s;e violences, a&s;&s;embled an army, and
pre|pared to cha&s;ti&s;e the rebels. She had about two thou&s;and French under
her command, with a few Scotch troops; and being a&s;&s;i&s;ted with &s;uch of

miles of Perth. Even the earl of Argyle, and the lord James Stuart, prior of

reformers, attended the regent in this enterprize, either becau&s;e they blamed
the fury of the populace, or hoped by their influence and authority to mediate
&s;ome agreement between the parties. The congregation, on the other hand, made
preparations for defence; and being joined by the earl of Glencarne from the

<P>THE Queen regent, finding &s;uch ob&s;tinate zeal in the
malecontents, was con|tented to embrace the councils of Argyle and the prior of
St. Andrew's, and to form an accommodation with them. She was received into
Perth, which &s;ubmit|ted to her, on promi&s;ing an indemnity of pa&s;t
offences, and engaging not to leave any French garri&s;on in the place. This
capitulation, it is pretended, was not exactly ob&s;erved. Some of the
inhabitants were mole&s;ted on account of the late violences; and &s;ome
companies of Scotch &s;oldiers, &s;uppo&s;ed to be in French pay, were
quartered in the town; which &s;tep, tho' taken under a very plau&s;ible
pretext, was regarded by the congregation as an infraction of the treaty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 139.</NOTE>. It is a&s;&s;erted, that the regent, to
ju&s;tify the&s;e mea&s;ures, declared, that princes ought not to have their
promi&s;es too &s;trictly urged upon them; nor was any faith to be kept with
heretics: And that for her part, could &s;he find as good a colour of rea&s;on,
&s;he would willingly bereave all the&s;e men of their lives and fortunes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Spot&s;wood, p. 123.</NOTE>. But it is no way
likely, that &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions dropt from this prudent and vir|tuous
prince&s;s. On the contrary, it appears, that the&s;e violences were very
di&s;|agreeable to her; that &s;he was in this particular over-ruled by the
authority of the French coun&s;ellors placed about her; and that &s;he often
thought, if the manage|ment of the&s;e affairs had been entru&s;ted wholly to
her&s;elf, &s;he could ea&s;ily, with|out force, have accommodated all
differences<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 146. Melvil, p. 29.
Knox, p. 225, 228. Le&s;ly, lib. x. That there was re|ally no violation of the
capitulation of Perth, appears from the manife&s;to of the congregation in
Knox, p. 184. where it is not &s;o much as pretended. The companies of Scotch
&s;oldiers were, probably, in Scotch pay, &s;ince the congregation complains,
that the country was oppre&s;&s;ed with taxes to maintain armies. Knox, p. 164,
165. And even if they had been in French pay, it were no breach of the
capitu|lation, &s;ince they were national troops, not French Knox does not
&s;ay, p. 139, that any of the inhabitants of Perth were tried or puni&s;hed
for their pa&s;t offences; but only that they were oppre&s;&s;ed with the
quartering of &s;oldiers: And the congregation in their manife&s;to, &s;ay only
that many of them had fled for fear. This plain detection of the calumny with
regard to the breach of the capitulation of Perth, may make us &s;u&s;pect a
like calumny with regard to the promi&s;e pretended not to give &s;entence
again&s;t the mini&s;ters. The affair lay altogether between the regent and the
laird of Dun; and that gentle|man, tho' a man of &s;en&s;e and character, might
be willing to take &s;ome general profe&s;&s;ions for promi&s;e. If the Queen,
over awed by the power of the congregation, gave &s;uch a promi&s;e, in order
to have li|berty to proceed to a &s;entence; how could &s;he expect to have

left Perth, <PB N="423" REF="24"> and while as yet they had no colour to

gave up them&s;elves entirely to the furious zeal of Knox, and renewed at
Crail, An|&s;truther, and other places in Fife, like depredations on the

Couper. The regent, who marched again&s;t them with her army, finding their
power &s;o much increa&s;ed, was glad to conclude a truce for a few days, and
to pa&s;s over with her forces to the Lothians. The in&s;urgents be&s;ieged and
took Perth; proceeded thence to Stirling, where they exerci&s;ed their u&s;ual
&s;ury; and finding nothing able to re&s;i&s;t them, they bent their march to
Edinburgh, the inhabitants of which, as they had already anticipated the zeal
of the congregation again&s;t the churches and mona&s;teries, gladly opened
their gates to them. The regent, with the few forces which remained with her,
took &s;helter in Dunbar, where &s;he &s;hut her&s;elf up, in expectation of a
reinforcement from France.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, &s;he employed her partizans in repre&s;enting to the
people the dangerous con&s;equences of this open rebellion; and &s;he
endeavoured to convince them, that the lord James, under pretence of religion,
had formed the &s;cheme of wre&s;ting the &s;cepter from the hands of the
&s;overeign. By the&s;e con&s;iderations many were engaged to de&s;ert the army
of the congregation; but much more by the want of pay or any means of
&s;ub&s;i&s;tance; and the regent, ob&s;erving the in|&s;urgents to be much
weakened, ventured to march to Edinburgh, with a de&s;ign to &s;uppre&s;s them.
On the interpo&s;al of the duke of Chatelraut, who &s;till adhered to her,
&s;he agreed to a capitulation, in which &s;he granted them a toleration of
their religion, and they engaged to commit no farther depredations on the
churches. Soon after they evacuated the city of Edinburgh; and before they left
it, they proclaimed the articles of agreement; but they took care to publi&s;h
only the articles favourable to them&s;elves, and they were guilty of an
impo&s;ture, in adding one to the number, viz. that idolatry &s;hall not again
be erected in any place where it was at that time &s;uppre&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 153, 154, 155. This author pretends that

en&s;uing rupture, which appeared inevitable. The regent having got a
reinforcement of 1000 men from France, began to fortify Leith; and the
congregation &s;educed the duke of Chatelraut to their party, who had long

<P>THE &s;ub&s;equent mea&s;ures of the Scotch reformers tended
&s;till more to cement their union with England. Being entirely ma&s;ters of

the Congregation, not waiting till the Queen of Scots &s;hould ratify that
treaty, thought them&s;elves fully intitled, without the &s;overeign's

a&s;&s;ert, that, among&s;t all the rabble of the clergy, &s;uch is their

them by the inva&s;ion of their property, but the Parliament took no notice of
them; till at la&s;t, the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tics, tired with fruitle&s;s
attendance, departed the town. They were then cited to appear; and as no body
pre&s;ented them&s;elves, it was voted by the Parliament, that the
eccle&s;ia&s;tics were entirely &s;atisfied, and found no rea&s;on of
complaint.</P>
<P>SIR James Sandilands, prior of St. John, was &s;ent over to
France to obtain the ratification of the&s;e acts; but was very ill received by
the Queen, who ab&s;olutely denied the validity of a Parliament, &s;ummoned
without the royal con&s;ent; and &s;he refu&s;ed her &s;anction to the&s;e
&s;tatutes. But the prote&s;tants gave them|&s;elves little concern about their
Queen's refu&s;al. They immediately put the &s;ta|tutes in execution: They
aboli&s;hed the ma&s;s; they &s;ettled their mini&s;ters; they committed every
where furious deva&s;tations on the mona&s;teries, and even on the churches,
which they thought to be profaned by idolatry; and e&s;teeming the property of
the clergy lawful prey, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, without ceremony, of the
far greater part of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues. Their new preachers, who
had authority &s;ufficient to incite them to war and in&s;urrection, could not
re&s;train their rapacity; and fanatici&s;m concurring with avarice, an
incurable blow was given to the papal authority in that country. The
prote&s;tant nobility and gentry, united by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch
unpardonable guilt, alarmed for their new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, well acquainted
with the imperious character of the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e, &s;aw no &s;afety for
them&s;elves but in the protection of England; and they di&s;|patched Morton,
Glencarne, and Ledington to expre&s;s their &s;incere gratitude to the Queen
for her pa&s;t favours, and to repre&s;ent to her the nece&s;&s;ity of
con|tinuing them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">French affairs.</NOTE> ELIZABETH had equal
rea&s;on to maintain an union with the Scotch prote|&s;tants; and &s;oon found,

had not laid a&s;ide the de&s;ign of conte&s;ting her title, and &s;ubverting

refu&s;ed to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh; and &s;howed no di&s;po&s;ition to
give her any &s;atisfaction for that mortal injury and affront which they had
put upon her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o openly

attending &s;uch preten&s;ions; and it was with plea&s;ure &s;he heard of the
violent factions, which prevailed in the French government, and of the
oppo&s;i|tion, which had ari&s;en again&s;t the mea&s;ures of the duke of
Guile. That ambi|tious prince, &s;upported by his four brothers, the cardinal
of Lorraine, the duke of Aumale, the marquis of Elbeuf, and the grand prior,
men no less ambitions <PB N="430" REF="33"> than him&s;elf, had engro&s;&s;ed
all the authority of the crown; and as he was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of every
quality, which could command the e&s;teem or &s;educe the affections of men,
there appeared no end of this acqui&s;itions and preten&s;ions. The
con|&s;table Montmorency, who had long ballanced his credit, was deprived of
all power: The princes of the blood, the King of Navarre and his brother the
prince of Cond&eacute;, were entirely excluded from offices and favour: The
Queen-mother her&s;elf, Catherine de Medicis, found her influence every day
declining. And as Francis, a young prince, infirm both in mind and body, was
wholly go|verned by his &s;pou&s;e, who knew no law but the plea&s;ure of her
uncles, men de&s;paired of ever obtaining freedom from the dominion of that
a&s;piring family. It was the conte&s;ts of religion, which fir&s;t in&s;pired
the French with courage openly to oppo&s;e their exorbitant authority.</P>
<P>THE theological di&s;putes, fir&s;t &s;tarted in the north of
Germany, and next in Switzerland, countries at that time wholly illiterate, had
long ago penetrated into France; and as they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the general
di&s;contents again&s;t the court and church of Rome, and by the zealous
&s;pirit of the age, the pro&s;elytes to the new religion were &s;ecretly

Francis, had oppo&s;ed the progre&s;s of the reformers; and tho' a prince
addicted to plea&s;ure and &s;ociety, he was tran&s;ported by a vehemence, as
well as bigotry, which had little place in his predece&s;&s;or's conduct.
Rigorous puni&s;hments had been inflicted on the mo&s;t eminent of the
prote&s;tant party; and a point of honour &s;eemed to have ari&s;en, whether
the one &s;ect could exer|ci&s;e or the other &s;uffer mo&s;t barbarity. The
death of Henry put &s;ome &s;top to the per&s;ecutions; and the people, who had
admired the con&s;tancy of the new preachers, now heard with favour and
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion their arguments and doctrines. But the cardinal of
Lorraine, as well as his brother, who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the legal
authority, thought it their intere&s;t to &s;upport the e&s;tabli&s;hed
religion; and when they revived the exerci&s;e of the penal &s;tatutes, they
nece&s;&s;arily engaged the malecontent princes and nobles in the protection of
the new religion. The King of Navarre, a man of mild di&s;po&s;itions, but of a
weak character, and the prince of Cond&eacute;, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many
heroic qualities, having declared them&s;elves in favour of the prote&s;tants,
that &s;ect acquired new force from their countenance; and the admiral de
Coligni, with his brother Andelot, no longer &s;crupled to declare them&s;elves
openly of their communion. The integrity of the admiral, who was believed
&s;incere in his pro&s;e&s;&s;ion, and his high renown both for valour and
conduct, for the arts of peace as well as of war, gave credit to the
re&s;ormers; and after a fru&s;trated attempt of the malecontents to &s;eize
the King's per&s;on at <PB N="431" REF="34"> Amboi&s;e, of which Elizabeth had

ha&s;tened to an extremity between the parties. But the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e,
tho' the&s;e factions had obliged them to remit their efforts in Scotland, and
had been one chief cau&s;e of Elizabeth's &s;ucce&s;s, were determined not to
relinqui&s;h their authority in France, or yield to the violence of their
anta|goni&s;ts. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 December.</NOTE> They found an opportunity
to &s;eize the King of Navarre and the prince of Conde; they threw the former
into pri&s;on; they obtained a &s;entence of death again&s;t the latter;

&s;entence in execution, when the King's &s;udden death &s;aved the noble
pri&s;oner, and interrupted the pro&s;perity of the duke of Gui&s;e. The
Queen-mother was appointed regent to her &s;on Charles the ninth, now in his
minority: The King of Navarre was named lieutenant|general of the kingdom: The
&s;entence again&s;t Cond&eacute; was annulled: The con|&s;table was recalled
to court: And the family of Gui&s;e, tho' they &s;till enjoyed great offices,
and great power, now found a counterpoi&s;e to their authority.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was not di&s;&s;atisfied to learn, that her avowed
enemies had met with &s;o &s;evere a check, and &s;he was determined to make
advantage of it again&s;t the Queen of Scots, whom &s;he &s;till regarded as a
dangerous rival. She &s;aw her|&s;elf freed from the perils attending an union
of Scotland with France; and was plea&s;ed to find, that &s;o powerful a prince
as the French monarch was no longer a pretender to her crown and kingdoms. But
&s;he con&s;idered, on the other hand, that the Engli&s;h catholics, who were
very numerous, and who were generally prejudiced in favour of Mary's title,
would now adhere to that prince&s;s with more zealous attachment, when they
&s;aw, that her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion no longer endan|gered the liberties of the
kingdom, and was rather attended with the advantages of producing an entire
union with Scotland. She gave orders, therefore, to her amba&s;&s;ador,
Throcmorton, a very vigilant and able mini&s;ter, to renew his ap|plications to
the Queen of Scots, and to require her ratification of the treaty of Edinburgh.
But tho' Mary had de&s;i&s;ted, after her hu&s;band's death, from bear|ing the
arms and title of Queen of England, &s;he &s;till declined gratifying
Eliza|beth in this momentous article; and hearkening too much to the ambitious
&s;ug|ge&s;tions of her uncles, &s;he refu&s;ed to make any formal renunciation
of her pre|ten&s;ions.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the Queen-mother of France, who imputed to Mary all
the mor|tifications which &s;he had met with during Francis's life-time, took
care to retaliate on her by like injuries; and the Queen of Scots, who found
her abode in France <PB N="432" REF="35"> di&s;agreeable, began to think of
returning into her native country. Lord James, who had been &s;ent in
deputation from the &s;tates to invite her over, &s;econded this intention; and
&s;he applied to Elizabeth, by D'Oi&s;el, for liberty to pa&s;s thro'
England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. I. p. 175.</NOTE>. But &s;he
received for an&s;wer, that till &s;he had given &s;atisfaction, by ratifying
the treaty of Edinburgh, &s;he could expect no favour from a per&s;on whom
&s;he had &s;o much injured. This denial excited her re&s;entment; and &s;he
made no &s;cruple of expre&s;&s;ing her &s;entiments to Throcmorton, when he
re|iterated his applications to gratify his mi&s;tre&s;s in a demand, which he
repre&s;ented as &s;o rea&s;onable. Having cleared the room of all her
attendants, &s;he &s;aid to him, 
<Q REND="inline">"How weak I may prove, or how far a woman's
frailty may tran&s;port me, I cannot tell: However, I have no mind to have &s;o
many witne&s;&s;es of my in|firmity as your mi&s;tre&s;s had at her audience of
my amba&s;&s;ador, D'Oi&s;el. There is nothing di&s;turbs me &s;o much, as the
having a&s;ked, with &s;o much im|portunity, a favour which it was of no
con&s;equence for me to obtain. I can, with God's leave, return to my own
country without her leave; as I came to France, in &s;pite of all the
oppo&s;ition of her brother, King Edward: Neither do I want friends, both able
and willing, to conduct me home, as they have brought me hither; tho' I was
de&s;irous rather to make an experiment of her friend&s;hip than of the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other per&s;on. I have often heard you &s;ay, that a
good corre&s;pondence between her and my&s;elf would conduce much to the
&s;ecurity and happine&s;s of both our kingdoms: But were &s;he well convinced
of this truth, &s;he had hardly denied me &s;o &s;mall a reque&s;t. But,
perhaps, &s;he bears a better inclination to my rebellious &s;ubjects than to
me, their &s;ove|reign, her equal in royal dignity, her near relation, and the
undoubted heir of her kingdoms. Be&s;ides her friend&s;hip, I a&s;k nothing at
her hands: I neither trouble her, nor concern my&s;elf in the affairs of her
kingdom: Not that I am ignorant, that there are now in England a great many
malecontents, who are no friends to the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment. She is
plea&s;ed to upbraid me as a per&s;on little experienced in the world: I freely
own it; but age will cure that defect. However, I am old enough to acquit
my&s;elf hone&s;tly and cour|teou&s;ly to my friends and relations, and to
encourage no reports of her, which would mi&s;become a Queen and her
kin&s;woman. I would al&s;o &s;ay, by her leave, that I am a Queen as well as
&s;he, and not altogether friendle&s;s: And, perhaps, I have as great a &s;oul
too; &s;o that methinks we &s;hould be upon a level in our treatment of each
other. As &s;oon as I have con&s;ulted the &s;tates of my kingdom, I &s;hall be
ready to give a rea&s;onable an&s;wer; and I am the more intent on my journey,
that I may be able to make the quicker di&s;patch in this <PB N="433" REF="36">
affair. But &s;he, it &s;eems, intends to &s;top my journey; &s;o that either
&s;he will not let me give her &s;atisfaction, or is re&s;olved not to be
&s;atisfied; perhaps, on purpo&s;e to keep up the di&s;agreement betwixt us.
She has often reproached me with my being young; and I mu&s;t be very young,
indeed, and as ill advi&s;ed, to treat of matters of &s;uch great concern and
importance, without the advice of my Parliament. I have not been wanting in any
friendly offices to her; but &s;he di&s;believes or overlooks them. I could
heartily wi&s;h, that I was as near allied to her in affection as in blood: For
that, indeed, would be a mo&s;t valuable alliance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Caballa, p 374. Spot&s;wood, p. 177.</NOTE>"</Q></P>
<P>SUCH a &s;pirited reply, notwith&s;tanding the obliging terms
inter&s;per&s;ed in it, was but ill fitted to conciliate friend&s;hip between
the&s;e rival prince&s;&s;es, or cure tho&s;e mutual jealou&s;ies which had
already taken place. Elizabeth equipped a fleet, under pretence of pur&s;uing
pyrates, but probably with an intention of in|tercepting the Queen of Scots in
her return homewards. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th Augu&s;t.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrival of Mary in Scot|land.</NOTE> Mary
embarked at Calais; and pa&s;&s;ing the Engli&s;h fleet in a fog, arrived
&s;afely at Leith, attended by her three uncles, the duke of Aumale, the grand
prior, and the marque&s;s of Elbeuf; together with the marque&s;s of Damville,
and other French courtiers. This change of abode and &s;ituation was very
little agreeable to that prince&s;s. Be&s;ides the natural
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of a country in which &s;he had been educated
from her earlie&s;t infancy, and where &s;he had borne &s;o high a rank, &s;he
could not forbear regreting her departure from among that people, &s;o
celebrated for their humane and &s;ociable di&s;po&s;ition, and their
re&s;pectful attachment to their &s;overeign, and reflecting on the di&s;parity
of the &s;cene which lay before her. It is &s;aid, that after &s;he was
embarked at Calais, &s;he kept her eyes fixed on the coa&s;t of France, and
never turned them from that beloved object, till darkne&s;s fell, and
intercepted it from her view. She then ordered a couch to be &s;pread for her
under the open air; and charged the pilot, that, if in the morning the land was
&s;till in &s;ight, he &s;hould awake her, and afford her one parting view of
that country in which all her affections were centered. The weather proved very
calm, &s;o that the &s;hip made little way in the night-time: And Mary had once
more an opportunity of &s;eeing the French coa&s;t. She &s;at up on her couch,
and &s;till looking towards the land, often repeated the&s;e words. 
<Q REND="inline">"Farewell, France, farewell; I &s;hall never
&s;ee thee more<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 179. Jebb, vol. 11. p.

more favourable, if not to her plea&s;ure and happine&s;s, at lea&s;t to her
repo&s;e and &s;ecurity, than &s;he had rea&s;on to apprehend. No &s;ooner did
the <PB N="434" REF="37"> French gallies appear off Leith, than people of all
ranks, who had long expect|ed their arrival, flocked towards the &s;hore, with
an earne&s;t impatience to behold and receive their young &s;overeign. Some
were led by duty, &s;ome by intere&s;t, &s;ome by curio&s;ity; and all combined
to expre&s;s their attachment to her, and to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into her
confidence, during the commencement of her ad|mini&s;tration. She had now
reached the nineteenth year of her age; and the bloom of her youth, and amiable
beauty of her per&s;on, were farther recommend|ed by the affability of her
addre&s;s, the politene&s;s of her manners, and the ele|gance of her genius.
Well accompli&s;hed in all the &s;uperficial, but engaging graces of a court,
&s;he afforded, when better known, &s;till more promi&s;ing indi|cations of her

long been deprived of the pre&s;ence of their &s;overeign, whom they once

univer&s;al &s;atisfaction; and nothing ap|peared about the court, but
&s;ymptoms of affection, joy, and fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t mea&s;ures which Mary embraced, confirmed all the
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which had been entertained in her favour. She followed
the advice which &s;he had received in France from D'Oi&s;el and the bi&s;hop
of Amiens, as well as her uncles; and gave her confidence entirely to the
leaders of the reformed party, who had greate&s;t influence on the people, and
who, &s;he found, were alone able to &s;upport her government. Her brother,
lord James, whom &s;he &s;oon after created earl of Murray, obtained the chief
authority; and after him, Liding|ton, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, a man of great
&s;agacity, had a principal &s;hare in her confidence. By the vigour of the&s;e
mens mea&s;ures &s;he endeavoured to re&s;tore order and police into the
country, divided by public factions and private feuds; and that fierce and
intractable people, unacquainted with laws and obedience, &s;eemed, for a time,
to &s;ubmit peaceably to her gentle and prudent admini|&s;tration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bigotry of the Scotch re|formers.</NOTE> BUT
there was one circum&s;tance which bla&s;ted all the&s;e promi&s;ing

&s;igns of di&s;&s;olute vanity. And to the har&s;h and prepo&s;terous u&s;age
which this prince&s;s met with, may, in part, be a&s;cribed tho&s;e errors of
her &s;ub&s;equent conduct, which &s;eemed to be &s;o little of a piece with
the general tenor of her character.</P>
<P>THERE happened to the marque&s;s of Elbeuf, before his
departure, an adven|ture which, tho' frivolous, might enable him to give Mary's
friends in France, a very melancholy idea of her &s;ituation. This nobleman,
with the earl of Both|wel, and &s;ome other young courtiers, had been engaged,
after a debauch, to pay a vi&s;it to a woman called Ali&s;on Craig, who was
known to be liberal of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a|vours; <PB N="438" REF="41"> and becau&s;e they were denied
entrance, they broke the windows, thru&s;t open the door, and committed &s;ome
di&s;orders, in &s;earching for the dam&s;el. It happened that the a&s;&s;embly
of the church was &s;itting at that time, and they im|mediately took the matter
under their cognizance. In conjunction with &s;everal of the nobility, they
pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the Queen, which was introduced with this awful
prelude. 
<Q REND="inline">"To the Queen's maje&s;ty, and to her &s;ecret
and great coun|cil, her grace's faithful and obedient &s;ubjects, the
profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;t Je&s;us's holy evangil wi&s;h the &s;pirit of
righteous judgment."</Q> The tenor of the pe|tition was, that the fear of God,
the duty which they owed her grace, and the terrible threatenings denounced by
God again&s;t every city or country where hor|rible crimes are openly
committed, compelled them to demand the &s;evere puni&s;h|ment of &s;uch as had
done what in them lay to kindle the wrath of God again&s;t the whole realm:
That the iniquity of which they complained, was &s;o heinous, and &s;o
horrible, that they would e&s;teem them&s;elves accomplices in it, if they had
been engaged by worldly fear, or &s;ervile complai&s;ance, to pa&s;s it over in
&s;ilence, or bury it in oblivion: That as they owed her grace obedience in the
admini&s;tra|tion of ju&s;tice, &s;o were they entitled to require of her, in
return, the &s;harp and condign puni&s;hment of this enormity, which, they
repeated it, might draw down the vengeance of God on the whole kingdom: And
that they in&s;i&s;ted on it to be her duty to lay a&s;ide all private
affections towards the actors in this heinous crime and enormous villainy, and
without delay bring them to a trial, and inflict the &s;evere&s;t penalties
upon them. The Queen gave a gracious reception to this pe|remptory addre&s;s;
but becau&s;e &s;he probably thought, that breaking the windows of a brothel
merited not &s;uch &s;evere reprehen&s;ion, &s;he only replied, that her uncle
was a &s;tranger, and that he was attended with a young company: But &s;he
&s;hould put &s;uch order to him and to all others, that her &s;ubjects
&s;hould henceforth have no rea&s;on to complain. Her pa&s;&s;ing over this
incident &s;o &s;lightly, was the &s;ource of great di&s;content, and was
regarded as a proof of the mo&s;t profligate man|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 30<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, 303, 304. Keith, p. 509.</NOTE>. It
is not to be omitted, that Ali&s;on Craig, the cau&s;e of all the uproar, was
known to entertain a commerce with the earl of Arran, who, on account of his

<P>SOME of the populace of Edinburgh broke into the Queen's chappel

mea&s;ures for oppo&s;ing ju&s;tice differed little from rebellion; and Knox
was &s;ummoned before the council to an&s;wer for his offence. The courage of
this man was equal to his in&s;olence. He &s;crupled not to tell the Queen,
that the pe&s;tilent papi&s;ts, who had enflamed her again&s;t the&s;e holy

<P>WE have related the&s;e circum&s;tances at greater length, than
the nece&s;&s;ity of our &s;ubject may &s;eem to require: But even trivial
incidents, which &s;how the manners of the age, are often more in&s;tructive,
as well as entertaining, than the great tran&s;actions of wars and
negotiations, which are pretty &s;imilar in all pe|riods and in all countries
of the world.</P>
<P>THE reformed clergy in Scotland had, at that time, a very
natural rea&s;on for their ill humour, viz. the poverty or rather beggary to
which they were reduced: The nobility and gentry had at fir&s;t laid their
hands on all the property of the regular clergy, without making any provi&s;ion
for the friars and nuns, whom they turned out of all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.
The &s;ecular clergy of the catholic com|munion, tho' they lo&s;t all
eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, &s;till held &s;ome of the tempora|lities of
their benefices; and either became laymen them&s;elves, and converted them into
perpetual property, or made conveyance of them at low prices to the no|bility,
who thus enriched them&s;elves by the plunder of the church. The new teachers
had hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted chiefly by the voluntary oblations of the
faithful; and in a poor country, divided in religious &s;entiments, this
e&s;tabli&s;hment was regarded as very &s;canty and very precarious. Repeated
applications were made for a le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">al
&s;ettlement to the preachers; and tho' almo&s;t every thing in the king|dom
was governed by their zeal and caprice, it was with difficulty that their
re|que&s;t was at la&s;t complied with. The fanatical &s;pirit which they
indulged, and then indu&s;try in decrying the principles and practices of the
Romi&s;h communion, which placed &s;uch a merit in enriching the clergy, proved
now a very &s;en&s;ible ob&s;tacle to their acqui&s;itions. The boundaries of
the royal power were, during <PB N="440" REF="43"> that age, more uncertain in
Scotland than even in England; and the privy coun|cil alone thought
them&s;elves intitled, without a Parliament, to regulate this im|portant
matter. They pa&s;&s;ed a vote<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 296. Keith, p.
210.</NOTE>, by which they divided all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices into
twenty one parts: They a&s;&s;igned fourteen to the antient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors:
Of the remaining &s;even, they granted three to the crown; and if that was
found to an&s;wer the public expences, they be&s;towed the overplus on the
reformed mi|ni&s;ters. The Queen was empowered to levy the whole &s;even; and
it was or|dained, that &s;he &s;hould afterwards pay to the clergy what
&s;hould be judged to &s;uffice for their maintenance. The nece&s;&s;ities of
the crown, the rapacity of the courtiers, and the &s;mall affection which Mary
bore the prote&s;tant eccle&s;ia&s;tics, rendered their revenues very
contemptible as well as uncertain; and the preachers, finding that they could
not rival the gentry, nor even the middling rank of men in opulence and plenty,
were nece&s;&s;itated to betake them&s;elves to other expe|dients for
&s;upporting their authority. They affected a furious zeal for religion,
moro&s;e manners, a vulgar and familiar, and yet my&s;terious, cant; and tho'
the liberality of &s;ub&s;equent princes put them afterwards on a better
footing with re|gard to revenue and thereby corrected in &s;ome degree the&s;e
vicious habits; it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that, while many other advantages
attend pre&s;byterian government, the&s;e inconveniencies are not ea&s;ily
&s;eparated from the genius of that eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity.</P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots, de&s;titute of all force, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
a narrow revenue, &s;urrounded with a factious turbulent nobility, a bigoted
people, and in&s;olent eccle&s;ia&s;tics, &s;oon found, that her only expedient
for maintaining tranquillity was to pre&s;erve a good corre&s;pondence with 
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 456.</NOTE>
Elizabeth, who by former engagements and &s;ervices, had acquired &s;uch
authority over all the&s;e ranks of men. Soon after her arrival in Scotland,
&s;ecretary Lidington was &s;ent to London, in order to pay her compliments to
the Queen, and expre&s;s her de&s;ire of friend&s;hip and a good
corre&s;pondence; and he received a commi&s;&s;ion from her, as well as from
the Scotch nobility, to demand, as a means of cementing this friend&s;hip, that
Mary &s;hould, by act of Parliament or by Proclamation (for the difference
be|tween the&s;e &s;ecurities was not then e&s;teemed very con&s;iderable) be
declared &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown. No reque&s;t could be more
unrea&s;onable, or made at a more improper juncture. The Queen replied, that
Mary had once di&s;covered her intention not to wait for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
but had openly, without ceremony or re&s;erve, a&s;&s;umed the title of Queen
of England, and had pretended &s;uperior right to her throne and kingdom: That
tho' her amba&s;&s;adors, and tho&s;e of her hu&s;band, the French King, had
&s;igned a treaty, where they renounced that claim, and promi&s;ed
&s;ati&s;|faction for &s;o great an indignity, &s;he was &s;o intoxicated with
this imaginary <PB N="441" REF="44"> right, that &s;he had rejected the mo&s;t
earne&s;t &s;ollicitations, and even, as &s;ome endeavoured to per&s;uade her,
incurred &s;ome danger in cro&s;&s;ing the &s;eas, rather than ratify that
equitable treaty: That her partizans every where had &s;till the a&s;&s;urance
to in&s;i&s;t on her title, and had pre&s;umed to talk of her own birth as
&s;purious and illegitimate: That while affairs were on this footing; while a
claim thus openly made, &s;o far from being openly renounced, was only
&s;u&s;pended till a more convenient opportunity; it would in her be the mo&s;t
egregious impru|dence to fortify the hands of a pretender to her crown, by
declaring her the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or: That no expedient could be wor&s;e imagined
for cementing friend&s;hip than &s;uch a declaration, and Kings were often
&s;ound to bear no good will to their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, even tho' their own
children; much more when the connexion was &s;o much le&s;s intimate, and when
&s;uch cau&s;e of di&s;gu&s;t and jealou&s;y had already been given, and indeed
was &s;till centinued, on the part of Mary: That tho' &s;he was willing, from
the amity which &s;he bore her kin&s;woman, to a&s;cribe her former
preten&s;ions to the advice of others, by who&s;e direction &s;he was then
governed; her refu&s;al to relinqui&s;h them could proceed only from her own
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and were a proof that &s;he &s;till retained &s;ome
dangerous project again&s;t her: That it was the nature of all men to be
di&s;gu&s;ted with the pre&s;ent, to entertain flatter|ing views of futurity,
to think their &s;ervices ill rewarded, to expect a better recompence from the
&s;ucce&s;&s;or; and &s;he would e&s;teem her&s;elf &s;carce half a
&s;ove|reign over the Engli&s;h, if they &s;aw her declare her heir, and arm
her rival with authority again&s;t her own repo&s;e and &s;afety: That &s;he
knew the incon&s;tant nature of the people; &s;he was acquainted with the
pre&s;ent divi&s;ions in religion; &s;he was not ignorant, that the &s;ame
party, which expected greate&s;t favour during the reign of Mary, did al&s;o
imagine, that the title of that prince&s;s was &s;uperior to her own: That for
her part, whatever claims were advanced, &s;he was determined to live and die
Queen of England; and after her death, it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of others to
examine who had the be&s;t preten&s;ions, either by the laws or by right of
blood, to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: That &s;he hoped the Queen of Scots's claim
would then be found pre&s;erable; and con&s;idering the injury, which &s;he
her&s;elf had re|ceived, it was &s;ufficient indulgence, if &s;he premi&s;ed,
in the mean time, to do nothing which might, in any re&s;pect, weaken or
invalidate that claim: And that Mary, if her title was really &s;uperior, a
point, which, for her own part, &s;he had never enquired into,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all advantages above her rivals; who, de&s;titute both of
pre&s;ent power, and of all &s;upport by friends, would only expo&s;e
them|&s;elves to inevitable ruin, by advancing any weak, or even doubtful
preten&s;ions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. XVII. c. 14-17.

<P><PB N="442" REF="45"> THESE views of the Queen were &s;o prudent
and judicious, that there was no likelihood of her ever departing from them:
But that &s;he might put the matter to a fuller proof, &s;he offered to explain
the words of the treaty of Edinburgh, &s;o as to leave no &s;u&s;picion of
their excluding Mary's right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 181.</NOTE>; and in this form, &s;he again
required her to ratify that treaty. Matters at la&s;t came to this i&s;&s;ue,
that Mary agreed to the propo&s;al, and offered to renounce all pre&s;ent
pre|ten&s;ions to the crown of England, provided Elizabeth would agree to
declare her the &s;ucce&s;&s;or<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Haynes, vol. I.

that &s;he never would con&s;ent to &s;trengthen the intere&s;t and authority
of any claimant, by fixing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; much le&s;s would &s;he make
this conce&s;&s;ion in favour of a rival Queen, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch

re&s;ign them, could ea&s;ily re&s;ume her title on the fir&s;t op|portunity.
Mary's demand, however, bore &s;o &s;pecious an appearance of equity and
ju&s;tice, that Elizabeth, &s;en&s;ible that rea&s;on would be deemed to lie
entirely on that &s;ide, made no more mention of the matter; and tho' no
farther conce&s;|&s;ions were made by either Prince&s;s, they put on all the
appearances of a cordial reconcilement and friend&s;hip with each other.

regulating the affairs of her own kingdom, and promoting the happine&s;s of her
people. She made &s;ome progre&s;s in paying tho&s;e great debts which lay upon
the crown: &s;he regulated the coin, which had been extremely deba&s;ed by her
prede|ce&s;&s;ors; &s;he furni&s;hed her ar&s;enals with great quantities of
arms from Germany and other places; engaged her gentry and nobility to imitate

gun-powder and bra&s;s can|non; fortified her frontiers on the &s;ide of
Scotland; made frequent reviews of the militia; encouraged agriculture by
allowing a free exportation of corn; promoted trade and navigation; and &s;o
much encrea&s;ed the &s;hipping of her kingdom, both by building ve&s;&s;els of

enterprizes, only enabled her to execute them with greater certainty and
&s;ucce&s;s; and all the world &s;aw in her conduct the happy effects of a
vigorous per&s;everance in judicious and well conducted projects.</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="46"> IT is ea&s;y to imagine, that &s;o great a
prince&s;s, who enjoyed &s;uch felicity and renown, would receive propo&s;als
of marriage from every one, who had any like|lihood of &s;ucceeding; and tho'
&s;he had made &s;ome public declarations in favour of a &s;ingle life, few
believed, that &s;he would per&s;evere forever in that re&s;olution. The
archduke Charles, &s;econd &s;on to the emperor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes,

Ca&s;imir, &s;on to the elector palatine, made applications to her; and as this
latter prince made profe&s;&s;ion of the reformed religion, he thought
him&s;elf, on this account, better intitled to &s;ucceed in his addre&s;&s;es.
Eric, King of Sweden, and Adolph, duke of Hol&s;tein, were encouraged by the
&s;ame views to become &s;uitors; and the earl of Arran, heir to the crown of
Scotland, was, by the &s;tates of that kingdom, recommended to her as a
&s;uitable marriage. Even &s;ome of her own &s;ubjects, tho' they did not
openly declare their preten&s;ions, entertained hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. The earl
of Arundel, a per|&s;on declining in years, but de&s;cended from a very antient
and noble family, as well as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great riches, flattered
him&s;elf with this pro&s;pect; as did al&s;o Sir Wil|liam Pickering, a man
much e&s;teemed for his per&s;onal merit. But the per&s;on mo&s;t likely to
&s;ucceed, was a younger &s;on of the late duke of Northumberland, the lord
Robert Dudley, who, by means of his exterior qualities, joined to addre&s;s and
flattery, had become, in a manner, her declared favourite, and had great
influence in all her councils. The le&s;s worthy he appeared of this
di&s;tinction, the more was his great favour a&s;cribed to &s;ome violent
affection, which could thus &s;educe the judgment of this penetrating
prince&s;s; and men long expected, that he would obtain the preference above
&s;o many princes and monarchs. But the Queen gave all the&s;e &s;uitors a
gentle refu&s;al, which &s;till encouraged their pur&s;uit; and &s;he thought,
that &s;he &s;hould the better attach them to her intere&s;ts, if they were
&s;till allowed to entertain hopes of &s;ucceeding in their preten&s;ions. It
is al&s;o probable, that this policy was not entirely free from a mixture of
female coquetry; and that, tho' &s;he was determined in her own mind never to
&s;hare her power with any man, &s;he was not di&s;plea&s;ed with the
court&s;hip, &s;ollicitation, and profe&s;&s;ions of love, which the de&s;ire
of acquiring &s;o valuable a prize, procured her from all quarters.</P>
<P>WHAT is mo&s;t &s;ingular in the conduct and character of
Elizabeth, is, that, tho' &s;he was determined never to have any heir of her
own body, &s;he was not only extremely aver&s;e to &s;ix any &s;ucce&s;&s;or to
the crown; but &s;eems al&s;o to have re&s;olved, as far as lay in her power,
that no one, who had preten&s;ions to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;hould ever have
any heirs or &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. After the exclu&s;ion given by 
<PB N="444" REF="47"> the will of Henry VIII. to the po&s;terity of Margaret,
Queen of Scotland, the right to the crown devolved on the hou&s;e of Suffolk;
and the lady Catherine Gray, younger &s;i&s;ter to the lady Jane, was now the
heir of that family. This lady had been married to the lord Herbert, &s;on to
the earl of Pembroke; but having been divorced from that nobleman, &s;he had
entered into a private contract with the earl of Hartford, &s;on to the
protector; and her hu&s;band, &s;oon after con&s;ummation, travelled into
France. In a little time &s;he appeared to be preg|nant, which &s;o enraged
Elizabeth, that &s;he threw her into the Tower, and &s;um|moned him to appear,
in order to an&s;wer for his mi&s;demeanor. He made no &s;cruple to acknowlege
the marriage, which, tho' concluded without the Queen's con&s;ent, was entirely
&s;uitable to both parties; and for this offence he was al&s;o committed to the
Tower. Elizabeth's &s;everity &s;topped not here: She i&s;&s;ued a
commi&s;&s;ion to enquire into the matter; and as Hartford could not, within
the time limited, prove the nuptials by witne&s;&s;es, their commerce was
declared un|lawful, and their po&s;terity illegitimate. They were &s;till
continued in cu&s;tody; but by bribing their keepers, they found means to have
farther intercour&s;e; and another child appeared to be the fruit of their
commerce. This was a fre&s;h &s;ource of vexation to the Queen; who made a fine
of fifteen thou&s;and pounds be &s;et on Hartford by the Star-Chamber, and
ordered his confinement to be thenceforth &s;till more rigid and &s;evere. He
lay in this condition for nine years, till the death of his wife, by freeing
Elizabeth from all fears, procured him his liberty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, vol. I. p. 369, 378, 396. Camden, p. 389. Heylin, p.
154.</NOTE>. This extreme &s;everity mu&s;t be accounted for, either by the
unrelenting jealou&s;y of the Queen, who was afraid that any pretender to the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion would acquire credit by having i&s;&s;ue; or by her malignity,
which, with all her great qualities, made one ingredient in her character, and
which led her to envy in others tho&s;e natural plea&s;ures of love and
po&s;terity, of which her own ambition and de&s;ire of dominion made her
renounce all pro&s;pect for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>THERE happened, about this time, &s;ome other events in the
royal family, where the Queen's conduct was more laudable. Arthur Pole, and his
brother, nephews to the late cardinal, and de&s;cended from the duke of
Clarence, brother to Edward the fourth, together with Anthony Forte&s;cue, who
had married a &s;i&s;ter of the&s;e gentlemen, and &s;ome other per&s;ons, were

<P><MILESTONE N="1562" UNIT="year"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Eu|rope.</NOTE> AFTER the
commencement of the religious wars in France, which ren|dered that
flouri&s;hing kingdom, during the cour&s;e of near forty years, a &s;cene of
horror and deva&s;tation, the great rival powers in Europe were Spain and
England; and it was not long before an animo&s;ity, fir&s;t political, then
per&s;onal, broke out between the &s;overeigns of the&s;e countries.</P>
<P>PHILIP the &s;econd of Spain, tho' he reached not any enlarged
views of policy, was endowed with great indu&s;try and &s;agacity, a remarkable
caution in his enter|prizes, an unu&s;ual fore&s;ight in all his mea&s;ures;
and as he was ever cool and un|moved by pa&s;&s;ion, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
neither talents nor inclination for war, both his &s;ubjects and his neighbours
had rea&s;on to expect great ju&s;tice, happine&s;s and tran|quillity, from his
admini&s;tration. But prejudices had on him a more pernicious ef|fect than ever
pa&s;&s;ions had on any other monarch; and the &s;pirit of bigotry and tyranny,
by which he was actuated, with the fraudulent maxims which governed his
councils, excited the mo&s;t violent agitation among his own people, engaged
him in acts of the mo&s;t enormous cruelty, and threw all Europe into
combu&s;tion.</P>
<P>AFTER Philip had concluded peace at Cambray, and had remained
&s;ome time in the Netherlands, in order to &s;ettle the affairs of that
country, he embarked for <PB N="446" REF="49"> Spain; and as the gravity of
that nation, with their re&s;pectful obedience to their prince, had appeared
much more agreeable to his humour, than the homely fa|miliar manners, and the
pertinacious liberty of the Flemi&s;h, it was expected, that he would re&s;ide
altogether at Madrid, and govern all his exten&s;ive dominions by Spani&s;h
mini&s;ters and Spani&s;h councils. Having met with a violent tempe&s;t on his
voyage, he no &s;ooner arrived in harbour, than he fell on his knees, and after
giving thanks for this deliverance, he vowed, that his life, which was thus
providentially &s;aved, &s;hould be thenceforth entirely dedicated to the
extirpation of here&s;y<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib. xxiii. cap. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. His &s;ub&s;equent conduct
corre&s;ponded to the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions. Finding that the new doctrines had
penetrated into Spain, he let loo&s;e the rage of per&s;e|cution again&s;t all
who profe&s;&s;ed them, or were &s;u&s;pected of adhering to them; and by his
violence he gave new edge, even to the unrelenting cruelty of prie&s;ts and
in|qui&s;itors. He committed to cu&s;tody Con&s;tantine Ponce, who had been
confe&s;&s;or to his father, the emperor Charles; who had attended him during
his retreat; and in who&s;e arms that great monarch had terminated his life:
And after this ec|cle&s;ia&s;tic died in pri&s;on, he &s;till ordered him to be
tried and condemned for here|&s;y, and his &s;tatue to be committed to the
flames. He even deliberated, whether he &s;hould exerci&s;e like &s;everity
again&s;t the memory of his father, who was &s;u&s;pect|ed, during his latter
years, to have indulged a propen&s;ity towards the Lutheran principles: In his
furious zeal for orthodoxy, he &s;pared neither age, &s;ex, nor condition: He
was pre&s;ent, with an inflexible countenance, at the mo&s;t barbar|ous
executions: He i&s;&s;ued rigorous orders for the pro&s;ecution of heretics, in
Spain, Italy, the Indies, and the Low Countries: And having founded his
de|termined tyranny on maxims of civil policy, as well as on principles of
religion, all his &s;ubjects &s;aw, that there was no method, except the mo&s;t
entire compliance, or mo&s;t ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, to e&s;cape or elude
the &s;everity of his vengeance.</P>
<P>DURING that extreme animo&s;ity which prevailed between the
adherents of the oppo&s;ite religions, the civil magi&s;trate, who found it
difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, for the &s;ame laws to govern &s;uch enraged
adver&s;aries, was naturally led by &s;peci|ous rules of prudence, in embracing
one party, to declare war again&s;t the other, and to exterminate, by fire and
&s;word, tho&s;e bigots, who, from abhorrence of his religion, had proceeded to
an oppo&s;ition of his power, and to an hatred of his per&s;on. If any prince
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch enlarged views as to fore&s;ee, that a mu|tual
toleration would in time abate the fury of religious prejudices, he yet met
with difficulties in reducing this principle to practice; and might deem the
ma|lady too violent to await a remedy, which, tho' certain, mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily be &s;low in its operations. But Philip, tho' a profound
hypocrite, and extremely govern|ed <PB N="447" REF="50"> by &s;elf-intere&s;t,
&s;eems al&s;o to have been him&s;elf actuated by an imperious bi|gotry; and as
he employed great reflection in all his conduct, he could ea&s;ily palliate the
gratification of his natural temper under the colour of wi&s;dom, and find in
this &s;y&s;tem no le&s;s advantage to his foreign than his dome&s;tic
politics. By placing him&s;elf at the head of the catholic party, he converted
the zealots of the ancient faith into partizans of the Spani&s;h greatne&s;s;
and by employing the pow|erful allurement of religion, he &s;educed every where
the &s;ubjects from that allegi|ance which they owed their native
&s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE cour&s;e of events, guiding and concurring with choice, had
placed Eli|zabeth in a &s;ituation diametrically oppo&s;ite; and had rai&s;ed
her to be the glory, the bulwark, and the &s;upport of the numerous, tho'
&s;till per&s;ecuted prote&s;tants, throughout all Europe. More moderate in her
temper than Philip, &s;he found, with plea&s;ure, that the principles of her
&s;ect required not &s;uch extreme &s;everity in her dome&s;tic government, as
was exerci&s;ed by that monarch; and having no object but
&s;elf-pre&s;ervation, &s;he united her intere&s;ts in all foreign negociations
with tho&s;e who were every where &s;truggling under oppre&s;&s;ion, and
guarding them&s;elves again&s;t ruin and extermination. The more virtuous
&s;overeign was thus happily thrown into the more favourable cau&s;e; and
fortune, in this in|&s;tance, concurred with policy and nature.</P>
<P>DURING the life-time of Henry the &s;econd and his
&s;ucce&s;&s;or, the force of the&s;e principles was &s;omewhat re&s;trained,
tho' not altogether overcome, by the mo|tives of a &s;uperior intere&s;t; and
the dread of uniting England with the French monarchy, engaged Philip to
maintain a good corre&s;pondence with Elizabeth. Yet even during this period he
rejected the garter which &s;he &s;ent him; he refu&s;ed to ratify the ancient
league between the hou&s;e of Burgundy and England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Digg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> Compleat

&s;hips to tran&s;port the French forces into Scotland; he endeavoured to
intercept the earl of Arran, who was ha&s;tening to join the malecontents in
that country; and the Queen's wi&s;e&s;t mini&s;ters &s;till regarded his
friend&s;hip as hollow and precarious<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Haynes,
vol. I. p. 280, 281, 283, 284.</NOTE>. But no &s;ooner did the death of Francis
the &s;econd put an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nd to Philip's
apprehen&s;ions with regard to Mary's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, than his animo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters"> again&s;t Elizabeth began more openly
to appear, and the intere&s;ts of Spain and England were found oppo&s;ite in
every negociation and tran&s;action.</P>
<P>THE two great monarchies of the continent, France and Spain,
being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of nearly equal force, were naturally antagoni&s;ts;
and England, from its power and &s;ituation, was intitled to &s;upport its own
dignity, as well as tranquill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">y, by
<PB N="448" REF="51"> holding the ballance between them. Whatever incident,
therefore, tended too much to depre&s;s any one of the&s;e rival powers, as it
left the other without con|troul, might be deemed contrary to the intere&s;t of
England: Yet &s;o much were the&s;e great maxims of policy over-ruled, during
that age, by the di&s;putes of theology, that Philip found an advantage in
&s;upporting the e&s;tabli&s;hed govern|ment and religion of France; and
Elizabeth in protecting faction and inno|vation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars of France.</NOTE> THE Queen-regent
of France, when re-in&s;tated in authority by the death of her &s;on, Francis,
had formed a plan of admini&s;tration more &s;ubtile than judi|cious; and
ballancing the Catholics with the Hugonots, the duke of Gui&s;e with the prince
of Cond&eacute;, &s;he endeavoured to render her&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary to both,
and to e&s;tabli&s;h her own dominion on their con&s;trained obedience<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib. ii.</NOTE>. But the equal
coun|terpoi&s;e of power, which, among foreign nations, is the &s;ource of
tranquillity, proves always the ground of quarrel between dome&s;tic factions;
and if the ani|mo&s;ity of religion concur with the frequent occa&s;ions which
pre&s;ent them&s;elves of mutual injury, it is impo&s;&s;ible, during any time,
to pre&s;erve a firm concord in &s;o delicate a &s;ituation. The con&s;table,
Montmorency, moved by concern for the ancient faith, joined him&s;elf to the
duke of Gui&s;e: The King of Navarre, from his incon&s;tant temper, and his
jealou&s;y of the &s;uperior genius of his brother, embraced the &s;ame party:
And Catherine, finding her&s;elf depre&s;&s;ed by this com|bination, had
recour&s;e to Cond&eacute; and the hugonots, who gladly embraced the
opportunity of fortifying them&s;elves by her countenance and protection<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. lib. iii.</NOTE>. An edict had been publi&s;hed, granting a
toleration to the prote&s;tants; but the inter|e&s;ted violence of the duke of
Gui&s;e, covered with the pretence of religious zeal, broke thro' this
agreement; and the two parties, after the fallacious tranquillity of a moment,
renewed their mutual in&s;ults and injuries. Cond&eacute;, Coligni, An|delot,
a&s;&s;embled their friends, and flew to arms: Gui&s;e and Montmorency got
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the King's per&s;on, and con&s;trained the Queen-regent
to embrace their party: Fourteen armies were levied and put in action in
different places of France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib.
vii.</NOTE>: Each province, each city, each family, was agitated with
inte&s;tine rage and animo&s;ity. The father was divided again&s;t the &s;on;
the brother again&s;t the brother; and women them&s;elves, &s;acrificing their
humanity as well as their timidity to the religious fury, di&s;tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves by acts of ferocity and valour<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Wherever the hugonots prevailed, the images were
broke, the altars pillaged, the churches demoli&s;hed, the mona&s;teries
con&s;umed with fire: Where &s;ucce&s;s attended the catholics, they burned the
bibles, re-baptized the infants, <PB N="449" REF="52"> con&s;trained married
per&s;ons to pa&s;s anew thro' the ceremony: And plunder, de|&s;olation, and
blood&s;hed attended equally the triumph of both parties. The Par|liament of
Paris it&s;elf, the &s;eat of law and ju&s;tice, in&s;tead of employing its
au|thority to compo&s;e the&s;e fatal quarrels, publi&s;hed an edict, by which
it put the &s;word into the hands of the enraged multitude, and empowered the
catholics every where to ma&s;&s;acre the hugonots<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. vii. Haynes, p 391.</NOTE>: And it was during
this period, when men began to be &s;omewhat enlightned, and in this nation,
renowned for poli&s;h|ed manners, that the theological rage, which had long
been boiling in mens veins, &s;eems to have attained its la&s;t &s;tage of
virulence and ferocity.</P>
<P>PHILIP, who was jealous of the progre&s;s which the hugonots
made in France, and who dreaded that the contagion would &s;pread into the
Low-Country Provinces, had formed a &s;ecret alliance with the princes of
Gui&s;e, and had entered into a mu|tual concert for the protection of the
ancient faith, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of here&s;y. He now &s;ent &s;ix
thou&s;and men, with &s;ome &s;upply of money, to reinforce the ca|tholic
party; and the prince of Cond&eacute;, finding him&s;elf unequal to &s;o great
a com|bination, countenanced by the regal authority, was obliged to di&s;patch
the Vi|dame of Chartres and Briguemaut to London, in order to crave the
a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance and protection of Elizabeth.

the garri&s;on of that place, the Queen &s;hould likewi&s;e &s;end over three

<P>ELIZABETH, be&s;ides the general and e&s;&s;ential intere&s;t of
&s;upporting the pro|te&s;tants, and oppo&s;ing the rapid progre&s;s of her
enemy, the duke of Gui&s;e, had other motives which engaged her to accept this
propo&s;al. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th Septem|ber.</NOTE> When &s;he concluded
the peace at Cateau Cambre&s;is, &s;he had good rea&s;on to fore&s;ee, that
France ne|ver would voluntarily fulfil the article with regard to the
re&s;titution of Calais; and many &s;ub&s;equent incidents had tended to
confirm this &s;u&s;picion. Con&s;ider|able &s;ums of money had been laid out
on the fortifications; long lea&s;es had been granted of the lands; and many
inhabitants had been encouraged to build and &s;ettle there, by a&s;&s;urances
that Calais &s;hould never be re&s;tored to the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> p. 54,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">57.</NOTE>. The Queen, therefore,
very wi&s;ely concluded, that could &s;he get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Havre, a
place which commanded the mouth of the Seine, and was of much greater
importance than Calais, &s;he would ea&s;ily con&s;train the French to execute 
<PB N="450" REF="53"> the treaty, and would have the glory of re&s;toring to
the crown that ancient po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, which was &s;o much the favourite
of the nation.</P>
<P>NO mea&s;ure could be more generally odious in France, than the
conclu&s;ion of this treaty with Elizabeth. Men were naturally led to compare
the conduct of Gui&s;e, who had finally cha&s;ed the Engli&s;h from France, and
had barred the&s;e dangerous and de&s;tructive enemies from all acce&s;s into
it, with the trea&s;onable po|litics of Cond&eacute;, who had again granted
them an entry into the heart of the king|dom. The prince had the more rea&s;on
to repent of this mea&s;ure, that he reaped not from it all the advantage which
he expected. Three thou&s;and Engli&s;h im|mediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Havre and Dieppe, under the command of Sir Ed|ward Poinings; but the latter
place was found &s;o little capable of being defend|ed, that it was immediately
abandoned<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. II. p. 199.</NOTE>. The
&s;iege of Rouen was already formed by the catholics, the command of the King
of Navarre and the con&s;table Montmorency; and it was with difficulty that
Poinings could throw a &s;mall reinforcement into the place. Tho' the&s;e
Engli&s;h troops behaved with great gallantry<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 161.</NOTE>, and the King of Navarre was mortally wounded
during the &s;iege; the catholics &s;till continued the attack of the place,
and carrying it at la&s;t by a&s;|&s;ault, put the whole garri&s;on to the
&s;word. The earl of Warwic, elde&s;t &s;on to the late duke of Northumberland,
arrived &s;oon after at Havre, with another body of three thou&s;and Engli&s;h,
and took on him the command of the place.</P>
<P>IT was expected, that the French catholics, flu&s;hed with their
&s;ucce&s;s at Rouen, would immediately have formed the &s;iege of Havre, which
was not as yet in any condition of defence; but the inte&s;tine di&s;orders of
the kingdom &s;oon diverted their attention to another enterprize. Andelot,
&s;econded by the negociations of Elizabeth, had levied a con&s;iderable body
of prote&s;tants in Germany; and having arrived at Orleans, the &s;eat of the
hugonots' power, he enabled the prince of Cond&eacute; and the admiral to take
the field, and oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of their ene|mies. After threatening
Paris during &s;ome time, they took their march towards Normandy, with a view
of engaging the Engli&s;h to act in conjunction with them, and of fortifying
them&s;elves with the farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they expected from the
zeal and vigour of Elizabeth<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 230.
Davila, llb. iii.</NOTE>. The catholics, commanded by the con&s;table, and
under him by the duke of Gui&s;e, followed on their rear; and overtaking them
at Dreux, obliged them to give battle. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th of De|cember.</NOTE> The field was fought
with great ob&s;tinacy on both &s;ides; and the action was di&s;tingui&s;hed by
this &s;ignal event, that Cond&eacute; and Montmorency, the commanders of the

enemies. The appearances of <PB N="451" REF="54"> victory remained with
Gui&s;e; but the admiral, who&s;e fate it ever was to be defeated, and &s;till

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> THE expences incurred by
a&s;&s;i&s;ting the French hugonots, had emptied the Queen's exchequer,
notwith&s;tanding her extreme frugality; and in order to ob|tain &s;upply,
&s;he found her&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ummoning a Parliament: An
expedient to which &s;he never voluntarily had recour&s;e. A little before the
meeting of this a&s;&s;embly, &s;he had fallen into a dangerous illne&s;s, the
&s;mall-pox; and as her life, during &s;ome time, was de&s;paired of, the
people became the more &s;en&s;ible of the perilous condition in which they
were placed, on account of the uncertainty which, in ca&s;e of her decea&s;e,
attended the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown. The partizans of the Queen of Scots
and tho&s;e of the hou&s;e of Suffolk, already divided the nation into two
factions; and every one fore&s;aw, that, tho' it might be po&s;&s;ible at
pre&s;ent to determine the controver&s;y by law, yet, if the throne was vacant,
nothing but the &s;word would be able to fix a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The commons,
there|fore, on the very opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, voted an addre&s;s to the
Queen; in which, after enumerating the dangers attending a broken and doubtful
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and mentioning the evils which their fathers had experienced
from the contending titles of York and Lanca&s;ter, they entreated the Queen to
put an end to their ap|prehen&s;ions, by choo&s;ing &s;ome hu&s;band, whom,
they promi&s;ed, whoever he was, gratefully to receive, and faithfully to
&s;erve, honour, and obey: Or if &s;he had entertained any reluctance to the
married &s;tate, they de&s;ired, that the lawful &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or might be
named, or at lea&s;t appointed by act of parliament. They remark|ed, that
during all the reigns which had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the conque&s;t, the nation
had never before been &s;o unhappy, as not to know the per&s;on who, in ca&s;e
of the &s;overeign's death, was legally entitled to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. And
they ob&s;erved, that the certain and fixed order which took place in the
inheritance of the French monarchy, was one chief &s;ource of the u&s;ual
tranquillity, as well as of the hap+pine&s;s of that kingdom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir Simon Dewe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">'s
Journ. p. 81.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ubject, tho' extremely intere&s;ting to the nation, was
very little agree|able to the Queen; and &s;he was &s;en&s;ible, that great
difficulties would attend every deci&s;ion. A declaration in favour of the
Queen of Scots, would form a &s;ettlement <PB N="452" REF="55"> perfectly
legal; becau&s;e that prince&s;s was commonly allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the
right of blood, and the exclu&s;ion given by Henry's will, deriving its weight
chiefly from an act of parliament, would lo&s;e all authority whenever the
Queen and Par|liament had made a new &s;ettlement, and re&s;tored the
Scotti&s;h line to their place in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But &s;he dreaded the
giving encouragement to the catholics, her &s;ecret enemies, by this
declaration. She was &s;en&s;ible, that every heir was, in &s;ome degree, a
rival; much more one who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a claim for the pre&s;ent
po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown, and who had already advanced, in a very open
manner, the&s;e dangerous preten&s;ions. The great power of Mary, both from the
favour of the catholic princes, and her connections with the hou&s;e of
Gui&s;e, not to mention the force and &s;ituation of Scotland, was well known
to her; and &s;he &s;aw no &s;ecurity that that prince&s;s, if fortified by a
&s;ure pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, would not again revive claims which
&s;he could never yet be prevailed on formally to relinqui&s;h. On the other
hand, the title of the hou&s;e of Suffolk was &s;upported only by the more
zealous prote&s;tants; and it was very doubtful, whether even a parliamentary
declaration in its favour would be&s;tow on it &s;uch validity as to give
&s;atisfaction to the people. The republican part of the con&s;titution had not
as yet acquired &s;uch an a&s;cendant as to controul, in any degree, the ideas
of hereditary right; and as the legality of Henry's will was &s;till
di&s;puted, tho' founded on the utmo&s;t autho|rity which a Parliament could
be&s;tow; who could be a&s;&s;ured, that a more recent act would be acknowleged
to have any greater force or validity? In the frequent revolutions which had of
late taken place, the right of blood had &s;till prevailed over religious
prejudices; and the nation had ever &s;hewed it&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed rather to
change its faith than the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Even many Prote&s;tants
declared them&s;elves in favour of Mary's claim of inheritance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>; and nothing would en|danger more general di&s;gu&s;t,
than to &s;ee the Queen openly, and without re&s;erve, take party again&s;t it.
That prince&s;s al&s;o, finding her&s;elf injured in &s;o &s;en&s;ible a point,
would thenceforth act as a declared enemy; and uniting together her fo|reign
and dome&s;tic friends, the partizans of her pre&s;ent title and of her
eventual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, would &s;oon bring matters to extremity again&s;t

rather that the people &s;hould run the hazard of contingent events, than that

which, at be&s;t, did not give entire &s;ecurity to the nation. She made,
therefore, an eva&s;ive an&s;wer to the applications of the com|mons; and when

<P>THE mo&s;t remarkable law pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was
that which bore the title of <HI>A&s;&s;urance of the Queen's royal power over

By this act, the a&s;&s;erting twice by writing, word, or deed, the pope's
au|thority, was &s;ubjected to the penalties of trea&s;on. All per&s;ons in
holy orders were bound to take the oath of &s;upremacy; as al&s;o, all who were
advanced to any degrees, either in the univer&s;ities or in common law; all
&s;choolma&s;ters, officers in court, or members of Parliament: And the penalty
of their &s;econd refu&s;al was trea&s;on. The fir&s;t offence in both ca&s;es,
was puni&s;hed by bani&s;hment and forfeiture. This rigorous &s;tatute, which
involved a real, tho' not general, per|&s;ecution, and of the wor&s;t kind too,
as it made a &s;crutiny into mens &s;ecret &s;enti|ments, was not extended to
any of the degree of a baron; becau&s;e it was not &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Queen
could entertain any doubt with regard to the fidelity of per&s;ons
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch high dignity. The lord Montacute made vigorous
oppo&s;ition to this bill; and a&s;&s;erted, in favour of the catholics, that
they di&s;|puted not, they preached not, they di&s;obeyed not the Queen, they
cau&s;ed no trouble nor tumults among the people<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>. It is, however, probable, that &s;ome &s;u&s;picions of

their rigour again&s;t them; tho' it is al&s;o more than probable, that they
were mi&s;taken in the nature of the remedy.</P>
<P>THERE was likewi&s;e another point where the Parliament, this
&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;hewed more the goodne&s;s of their intention than the
&s;oundne&s;s of their judgment. They pa&s;&s;ed a law again&s;t fond and
fanta&s;tical prophecies, which had been ob|&s;erved to &s;educe the people
into rebellion and di&s;order<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Eliz. c. 15.</NOTE>: But at the &s;ame
time they enacted a &s;tatute which was mo&s;t likely to increa&s;e the&s;e and
&s;uch like &s;u|per&s;titions: It was levelled again&s;t conjurations,

increa&s;e by puni&s;hment, and never are &s;o e&s;&s;ectually &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
as by being totally neglected. After the Par|liament <PB N="454" REF="57"> had
granted the Queen a &s;upply of one &s;ub&s;idy and two fifteenths, it was
fini&s;hed by a prorogation. The convocation likewi&s;e voted the Queen a
&s;ub|&s;idy of &s;ix &s;hillings in the pound, payable in three years.</P>
<P>WHILE the Engli&s;h parties exerted the&s;e calm efforts
again&s;t each other, in parliamentary votes and debates, the French factions,
enflamed to the highe&s;t de|gree of animo&s;ity, continued that cruel war
which their intemperate zeal, actu|ated by the ambition of their leaders, had
kindled in the kingdom. The admiral was &s;ucce&s;sful in reducing the towns of
Normandy which held for the King; but he frequently complained, that the
numerous garri&s;on of Havre remained totally unactive, and was not employed in
any military operations again&s;t the common enemy. The Queen, in taking
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that place, had publi&s;hed a mani|fe&s;to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. II.</NOTE>, in which &s;he pretended, that her
concern for the French King's intere&s;t, had engaged her in that mea&s;ure,
and that her &s;ole intention was to oppo&s;e her enemies of the hou&s;e of
Gui&s;e, who held their prince in captivity, and employed his power to the
de&s;truction of his be&s;t and mo&s;t faithful &s;ubjects. It was chiefly her
de&s;ire to pre&s;erve appearances, joined to the great frugality of her
temper, which made her, at this critical juncture, keep her &s;oldiers in
garri&s;on, and re|&s;train them from committing farther ho&s;tilities upon the
enemy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 276, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">7.</NOTE>. The duke of Gui&s;e, meanwhile, was aiming a
mortal blow at the power of the Hugonots; and had commenced the &s;iege of
Orleans, which was commanded by Andelot, and where the con&s;table was detained
pri&s;oner. He had the pro&s;pect of &s;peedy &s;ucce&s;s in this undertaking;
when he was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by Poltrot, a young gen|tleman, who&s;e zeal,
in&s;tigated (as it is pretended, tho' without any certain foundation) by the
admiral and Beza, a famous preacher, led him to attempt that criminal
enterprize. The death of this gallant prince was a very &s;en|&s;ible lo&s;s to
the catholic party; and tho' the cardinal of Lorraine, his brother, &s;till
&s;upported the intere&s;t of the family, the danger of their progre&s;s
appeared much le&s;s imminent, both to Queen Elizabeth and to the French
prote&s;tants. The union, therefore, between the&s;e allies, which had been
cemented by their common fears, began thenceforth to be le&s;s intimate; and
the leaders of the Hugonots were per&s;uaded to hearken to terms of
accommodation. Cond&eacute; and Montmorency held conferences for &s;ettling the
peace; and as they were both of them impatient to relieve them&s;elves from
captivity, they &s;oon came to an agreement with regard to the conditions. The
character of the Queen-regent, who&s;e ends were always violent, but who
endeavoured, by &s;ubtilty and policy, rather than force, to attain them, led
her to embrace any plau&s;ible terms; and in <PB N="455" REF="58"> &s;pite of
the admiral's prote&s;tations, who&s;e &s;agacity could ea&s;ily di&s;cover the
treachery of the court, the articles of agreement were finally &s;ettled
between the parties. A toleration, under &s;ome re&s;trictions, was anew
granted to the prote|&s;tants; a general amne&s;ty was publi&s;hed;
Cond&eacute; was rein&s;tated in his offices and governments; and after money
was advanced for the payment of arrears due to the German troops, they were
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the kingdom.</P>
<P>BY the agreement between Elizabeth and the prince of
Cond&eacute;, it had been &s;tipulated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol II.
p. 79.</NOTE>, that neither party &s;hould conclude peace without the con&s;ent
of the other; but this article was at pre&s;ent but little regarded by the
leaders of the French prote&s;tants. They only comprehended her &s;o far in the
treaty, as to obtain a promi&s;e, that, on her relinqui&s;hing Havre, her
charges and the money which &s;he had advanced them, &s;hould be repaid her by
the King of France, and that Calais, on the expiration of the term, &s;hould be
re&s;tored to her. But &s;he di&s;dained to accept of the&s;e terms; and
thinking the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Havre a much better pledge for the obtaining
her purpo&s;e, &s;he &s;ent Warwic orders to prepare him&s;elf again&s;t an
attack from the now united power of the French monarchy.</P>
<P>THE earl of Warwic, who commanded a garri&s;on of &s;ix
thou&s;and men, be&s;ide &s;even hundred pioniers, had no &s;ooner got
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Havre, than he employed every means for putting it in a
po&s;ture of defence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 158.</NOTE>; and
after expelling the French from the town, he encouraged his &s;oldiers to make
the mo&s;t de&s;perate defence again&s;t the enemy. The con&s;table commanded
the French army; the Queen-regent her&s;elf, and the King were pre&s;ent in the
camp; even the prince of Cond&eacute; joined the King's forces, and gave
countenance to this enterprize; the admiral and Andelot alone, who &s;till
de&s;ired to pre&s;erve Elizabeth's friend&s;hip, kept at a di&s;tance, and
prudently refu&s;ed to join their antient enemies in an attack upon their
allies.</P>
<P>BY the force, and di&s;po&s;itions, and &s;ituation of both
&s;ides, it was expected, that the &s;iege would be attended with &s;ome very
memorable event; yet did France make a much ea&s;ier acqui&s;ition of this
important place, than was at fir&s;t apprehended. The plague crept in among the
Engli&s;h &s;oldiers; and being en|crea&s;ed by their fatigue and bad diet (for
they were but ill &s;upplied with provi|&s;ions<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 337, 498.</NOTE>) it committed &s;uch ravages, that
&s;ometimes an hundred men a day died of it, and there remained not at la&s;t
fifteen hundred in a condition to do duty<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

carried on their attacks &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully; and having made two breaches,

con&s;ider of the proper method for &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of England:
But as Elizabeth carefully avoided touching on this delicate &s;ubject, &s;he
employed a pretext of the wars in France, which, &s;he &s;aid, would detain her
in London; and &s;he delayed till next year the intended interview. It is

<P>MARY'S clo&s;e connexions with the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e, and her
devoted attach|ment to her uncles, by whom &s;he had been educated and
protected, was the ground of ju&s;t and un&s;urmountable jealou&s;y to
Elizabeth, who regarded them as her mortal and declared enemies, and was well
acquainted with their dangerous character and ambitious projects. They had made
offer of their niece to Don Carlos, Philip's &s;on; to the King of Sweden, the
King of Navarre, the arch|duke Charles, the duke of Ferrara, the cardinal of
Bourbon, who had only taken deacons orders, from which he might ea&s;ily be

on her part was equally vigilant to obviate the execution of their &s;chemes,

alliance, which might tempt her to revive her preten&s;ions to the crown, and

&s;he de&s;ired that Mary's choice &s;hould fall.</P>
<P>THE earl of Leice&s;ter, the great and powerful favourite of
Elizabeth, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e exterior qualities, which are
naturally alluring to the fair &s;ex; a hand&s;ome per&s;on, a polite
addre&s;s, an in&s;inuating behaviour; and by means of the&s;e
accompli&s;hments, he had been able to blind even the penetration of
Eli|zabeth, and conceal from her the great defects, or rather odious vices,
which attended his character. He was proud, in&s;olent, intere&s;ted,
ambitious; without honour, without genero&s;ity, without humanity; and attoned
not for the&s;e bad qualities, by any &s;uch abilities or courage, as could fit
him for that high tru&s;t and confidence with which &s;he always honoured him.
Her con&s;tant and de|clared attachment to him had very naturally emboldened
him to a&s;pire to her bed; and in order to make way for the&s;e nuptials, he
was univer&s;ally believed to have murdered, in a barbarous manner, his wife,
the heire&s;s of one Robe&s;art. The propo&s;al of e&s;pou&s;ing Mary was by no
means agreeable to him; and he always a&s;cribed it to the contrivance of
Cecil, his enemy; who intended by that artifice to make him lo&s;e the
friend&s;hip of Mary from the temerity of his preten&s;ions, and that of
Elizabeth from jealou&s;y of his attachments to another woman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 396.</NOTE>. The Queen her&s;elf had not any &s;erious
intention of effecting this marriage; but, as &s;he was de&s;irous, that the
Queen of Scots &s;hould never take any hu&s;band, &s;he named a man, who, &s;he
believed, was not likely to be accepted of; and &s;he hoped, by that means, to
gain time, and elude the project of any other alliance. The earl of Leice&s;ter
was too great a favourite to be parted with; and when Mary, allured by the
pro&s;pect of being declared &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown, &s;eemed at la&s;t
to hearken to Elizabeth's propo&s;al, this prince&s;s receded from her former

conduct, joined to &s;ome appearance of an imperious &s;uperiority, a&s;&s;umed

corre&s;pondence of the two Queens was during &s;ome time interrupted. In order
to make up this breach, the Queen of Scots di&s;patched Sir James Melvil to
London; who has given us a very particular account of this negociation.</P>
<P>MELVIL was an agreeable courtier, a man of addre&s;s and

be&s;ides grave rea&s;onings con|cerning politics and &s;tate-affairs, he
&s;hould introduce more entertaining topics of conver&s;ation, &s;uitable to

to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into her confidence. He &s;ucceeded &s;o 
<PB N="459" REF="62"> well, that he threw that artful prince&s;s entirely off
her guard<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 447.</NOTE>, and brought
her to di&s;cover the bottom of her heart, full of all tho&s;e levities and
follies and ideas of rival&s;hip, which po&s;&s;e&s;s the younge&s;t and mo&s;t
frivolous of her &s;ex. He talked to her of his travels, and forgot not to
mention the different dre&s;&s;es of the ladies in different countries, and the
particular advantages of each, in &s;etting off the beauties of the &s;hape and
per&s;on. The Queen &s;aid that &s;he had dre&s;&s;es of all countries, and
&s;he took care thenceforth to meet the amba&s;&s;ador every day appa|relled in

&s;ome|times in the French, &s;ometimes in the Italian; and &s;he a&s;ked him,
which of them became her mo&s;t. He an&s;wered, the Italian; a reply, that he
knew would be agreeable to her, becau&s;e that mode &s;howed her flowing locks,
which, he remarked, tho' they were more red than yellow, &s;he fancied to be
the fine&s;t in the world. She de&s;ired to know of him what was reputed the
be&s;t colour of hair: She a&s;ked whether his Queen's hair or hers was be&s;t:
She even enquired which of them he e&s;teemed the faire&s;t per&s;on: A very
delicate que&s;tion, and which he prudently eluded, by &s;aying that her
maje&s;ty was the faire&s;t per&s;on in England, and his mi&s;tre&s;s in
Scotland. She next demanded which of them was talle&s;t: He replied, his queen:
Then, &s;aid Elizabeth, &s;he is too tall: For I my|&s;elf am of a ju&s;t
&s;tature. Having learned from him, that his mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ome|times
recreated her&s;elf by playing on the harp&s;icord, an in&s;trument at which
&s;he her&s;elf excelled, &s;he gave orders to lord Hun&s;don, that he &s;hould
lead him, as it were ca&s;ually, into an apartment, where he might hear her
performance; and when Melvil, as if ravi&s;hed with the harmony, broke into the
Queen's apart|ment, &s;he pretended to be di&s;plea&s;ed at his intru&s;ion;
but &s;till took care to a&s;k whether he thought Mary or her the be&s;t

might &s;oon render him&s;elf agreeable to the Queen of Scots. He was al&s;o by
his father a branch of the &s;ame family with her&s;elf; and would, in

was, after her, next heir to the crown of England; and tho&s;e who pretended to
exclude her on account of her being a foreigner, had endeavoured to recommend
his title, and give it the preference. It &s;eemed no incon&s;iderable
advantage, that &s;he could, by marrying him, unite both their claims; and as
he was by birth an Engli&s;hman, and could not by his power or alliances give
any ground of &s;u&s;picion to Elizabeth, it was hoped that the propo&s;al of
this mar|riage would not be unacceptable to that jealous prince&s;s.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was well informed of the&s;e intentions of the court

unexceptionable, and even laudable; yet had &s;he not made &s;uch progre&s;s in
acquiring popularity, as might have been expected from her gracious deportment
and agreeable accompli&s;hments. Su&s;picions every moment prevailed on account
of her attachment to the catholic faith, and e&s;pecially to her uncles, the
open and avowed promoters of the &s;cheme for exterminating the profe&s;&s;ors
of the reformed religion throughout all Europe. She &s;till refu&s;ed to ratify
the acts of Parliament, which had e&s;tabli&s;hed the reformation; &s;he made
attempts for re&s;toring to the catholic bi&s;hops &s;ome part of their civil
juri&s;diction<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 198.</NOTE>; and
&s;he wrote a letter to the council of Trent, in which, be&s;ides
profe&s;&s;ing her at|tachment to the catholic faith, &s;he took notice of her

his credit at court much dimini&s;hed by the intere&s;t of Le|nox, and his

other means of accounting for that lavi&s;h and im|prudent kindne&s;s, with
which &s;he honoured him. The rigid au&s;terity of the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics, who
could admit of no freedoms, contributed to &s;pread this opinion among the
people; and as Rizzio was univer&s;ally believed to be a pen&s;ionary of the
pope, and to be deeply engaged in all &s;chemes again&s;t the prote&s;tants,
any &s;tory to his and Mary's di&s;advantage, received an ea&s;y credit among

<P>RIZZIO, who had connected his intere&s;t with the Roman
catholics, was the declared enemy of the bani&s;hed lords; and by promoting the
violent pro&s;ecu|tion again&s;t them, had expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the
animo&s;ity of their numerous friends and retainers. A &s;cheme was al&s;o
thought to be formed for revoking &s;ome exor|bitant grants made during the
Queen's minority; and even the nobility, who had &s;eized the
eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices, began to think them&s;elves le&s;s &s;ecure in
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Keith, p 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">6. Melvil, p. 64.</NOTE>. The earl of
Morton, chancellor, was affected by all the&s;e con&s;iderations, and &s;till
more by a rumour &s;pread abroad, that Mary intended to appoint Rizzio
chancellor in his place, and to be&s;tow that dignity on a mean and up&s;tart

this prince&s;s been in her kindne&s;s to Rizzio, that even that &s;trange
report met with credit, and proved a great means of accelerating the ruin of
the favourite. Morton, in&s;inuating him&s;elf into Henry's confidence,
employ|ed all his art to enflame the di&s;content and jealou&s;y of that
prince; and he per&s;uaded him, that the only means of freeing him&s;elf from
the indignities un|der which he laboured, was to bring the ba&s;e &s;tranger to
that fate which he had &s;o well merited, and which was &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately
de&s;ired by the whole nation. George Douglas, natural brother to the
counte&s;s of Lenox, concurred in the &s;ame advice; and the lords Ruthven and
Linde&s;ey, being con&s;ulted, offered their concurrence in the enterprize; nor
was even the earl of Lenox, the King's father, aver&s;e to the de&s;ign<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Crawford p. 7.</NOTE>. But as the&s;e con&s;pirators
were well acquainted <PB N="468" REF="71"> with Henry's levity, they engaged
him to &s;ign a paper, in which he avowed the undertaking, and promi&s;ed to

fully concerted, a me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched to the bani&s;hed lords, who
were ho|vering near the borders; and they were invited by the King to return to
their na|tive country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">9th March.</NOTE> THIS de&s;ign, &s;o
atrocious in it&s;elf, was rendered &s;till more &s;o by the circum|&s;tances
which attended its execution. Mary, who was in the &s;eventh month of her
pregnancy, was &s;upping in private, and had at table the counte&s;s of Argyle,
her natural &s;i&s;ter, with Rizzio, and others of her &s;ervants. The King
entered the room by a private pa&s;&s;age, and &s;tood at the back of Mary's
chair: The lord Ruthven, George Douglas, and other con&s;pirators, being all
armed, ru&s;hed in after him; and the Queen of Scots, terrified with the
appearance, demanded of them the rea&s;on of this rude intru&s;ion. They told
her, that they intended no violence again&s;t her per&s;on; but meant only to
bring that villain, pointing at Rizzio, to his de&s;erved puni&s;hment. Rizzio,
aware of the danger, ran behind his mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;eizing her by the
wai&s;t, called aloud to her for protection; while &s;he interpo&s;ed in his
behalf, with cries, and menaces, and entreaties. The impa|tient
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, regardle&s;s of her efforts, ru&s;hed upon their prey, and
by over|turning every thing which &s;tood in their way, increa&s;ed the horror
and confu&s;ion of the &s;cene. Douglas, &s;eizing Henry's dagger, &s;tuck it
in the body of Rizzio, who, &s;creaming with fear and agony, was torne from
Mary by the other con&s;pi|rators, and pu&s;hed into the antichamber, where he
was di&s;patched with fifty-&s;ix wounds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Melvil,
p. 64. Keith, p. 330, 331. Crawford, p. 9.</NOTE>. The unhappy prince&s;s,
informed of his fate, immediately dried her tears, and &s;aid, &s;he would weep
no more; &s;he would now think of revenge. The in&s;ult, indeed, upon her
per&s;on; the &s;tain attempted to be fixed on her honour; the danger to which
her life was expo&s;ed, on account of her pregnancy; were injuries &s;o
atrocious, and &s;o complicated, that they &s;carce left room for par|don, even
from the greate&s;t lenity and mercy.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, apprehen&s;ive of Mary's re&s;entment,
detained her a pri&s;oner in the palace; and the King di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all
tho&s;e who &s;eemed willing to attempt her re&s;cue, by telling them, that
nothing was done without his orders, and that he would be careful of the
Queen's &s;afety. Murray, and the bani&s;hed lords, appeared two days after;
and Mary, who&s;e anger was now engro&s;&s;ed by injuries more recent and
violent, was willingly reconciled to them; and &s;he even received her brother 
<PB N="469" REF="72"> with tenderne&s;s and affection. They obtained an
acquital from the Parliament, and were re-in&s;tated in their honours and
fortunes. The accomplices al&s;o in Rizzio's murder applied to her for a
pardon; but &s;he artfully delayed compliance, and per&s;uaded them, that &s;o
long as &s;he was detained in cu&s;tody, and was &s;ur|rounded by guards, any
deed which &s;he &s;hould &s;ign, would have no force nor validity. Mean while
&s;he had gained the confidence of her hu&s;band, by her per&s;ua&s;ion and
care&s;&s;es; and no &s;ooner were the guards withdrawn, than &s;he engaged him
to e&s;cape with her in the night time, and take &s;helter in Dunbar. Many of
her &s;ubjects here offered her their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and Mary, having
collected an army, which the con&s;pirators had no power to re&s;i&s;t,
advanced to Edinburgh, and obliged them of fly into England, where they lived
in great poverty and di&s;tre&s;s. They made applications, however, to the earl
of Bothwel, a new favourite of Mary's; and that nobleman, de&s;irous to
&s;trengthen his party by the acce&s;&s;ion of their intere&s;t, was able to
pacify her re&s;entment, and he &s;oon after procured them liberty to re|turn
into their own country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 75, 76. Keith, p.

<P>THE vengeance of the Queen of Scots was implacable again&s;t her
hu&s;band alone, who&s;e per&s;on was before di&s;agreeable to her, and who, by
his violation of every tie of gratitude and duty, had drawn on him her
highe&s;t re&s;entment. She engaged him to di&s;own all connections with the
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, to deny any concurrence in their crime, even to publi&s;h a
proclamation containing a fal&s;ehood &s;o notorious to the whole world<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. I. p. 280. Keith, Appen. p.
167.</NOTE>; and having thus made him expo&s;e him&s;elf to univer&s;al
con|tempt, and rendered it impracticable for him ever a&s;ter to acquire the
confidence of any party, &s;he threw him off with di&s;dain and
indignation<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 66, 67.</NOTE>. As if
&s;he had been making an e&s;cape from him, &s;he &s;uddenly withdrew to Alloa,
a &s;eat of the earl of Mar; and when Henry followed her thither, &s;he
returned &s;uddenly to Edin|burgh; and gave him every where the &s;tronge&s;t
proofs of di&s;plea&s;ure, and even of antipathy. She encouraged her courtiers
in their neglect of him; and &s;he was plea&s;ed, that his mean equipage, and
&s;mall train of attendants, &s;hould draw on him the contempt of the very
populace. He was permitted, however, to have apartments in the ca&s;tle of
Edinburgh, which Mary had cho&s;en for the place of her delivery. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th June.</NOTE> She was there delivered of a
&s;on; and as this was very important news to England, as well as to Scotland,
&s;he immediately di&s;patched Sir James Melvil to carry intelligence of the
happy event to Elizabeth. Melvil tells us, that that prince&s;s, the evening of
his arrival in London, had given a ball to her court at Greenwich, and was
di&s;playing all that &s;pirit and alac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ity which u&s;ually attended her on the&s;e occa&s;ions: But when
the prince of Scotland's <PB N="470" REF="73"> birth was notified to her, all
her joy was damped: She &s;unk into melancholy; &s;he reclined her head upon
her arm; and complained to-&s;ome of her attendants, that the Queen of Scots
was mother of a fair &s;on, while &s;he was but a barren &s;tock. Next day,
however, on the reception of the Scotch amba&s;&s;ador, &s;he a&s;&s;umed her
former di&s;&s;imulation, put on a joyful countenance, gave Melvil thanks for
the ha&s;te he had made in conveying to her the agreeable intelligence, and
expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t cordiality and friend&s;hip to her &s;i&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 69, 70.</NOTE>. Some time after, &s;he di&s;patched the
earl of Bedford, with her relation, George Cary, &s;on to the lord Hun&s;don,
in order to officiate at the bapti&s;m of the young prince; and &s;he &s;ent by

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> The&s;e humours broke out
with great vehemence in a new &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, which was held after
&s;ix prorogations. The hou&s;e of peers, which had hitherto forborne to touch
on the delicate point of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, here took the lead; and the
hou&s;e of commons &s;oon after imitated the zeal of the lords. Molineux opened
the matter in the lower hou&s;e, and propo&s;ed that the que&s;tion of the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion and that of &s;upply &s;hould go hand in hand; as if it were
intended to con&s;train the Queen to a compliance with the reque&s;t of her
Parliament<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 179.</NOTE>. The courtiers
endeavoured to elude the debate: Sir Ralph Sadler told the hou&s;e, that he had
heard the Queen po&s;itively affirm, that, for the good of her people, &s;he
was determined to marry. Secretary Cecil and Sir Francis Knollys gave their
te&s;timony to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; as did al&s;o Sir Ambro&s;e Cave,
chancellor of the dutchy, and Sir Edward Rogers, comptroler of the
hou&s;hold<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 12<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. Elizabeth's ambitious and ma&s;culine
character was &s;o well known, that few members gave any credit to this
intelligence; and it was con&s;idered merely as an artifice, by which &s;he
en|deavoured to retract that po&s;itive affirmation, which &s;he had made in
the begin|ning of her reign, that &s;he meant to live and die a virgin. The
mini&s;ters therefore gained nothing farther by this piece of policy, but only
to engage the hou&s;e, for the &s;ake of decency, to join the que&s;tion of the
Queen's marriage with that of a &s;ettlement of the crown; and they were
proceeding with great earne&s;t|ne&s;s in the debate, and had even appointed a
committee to confer with the lords, when expre&s;s orders were brought them
from Elizabeth not to proceed farther in that matter. Cecil told them, that
&s;he pledged to the hou&s;e the word of a Queen for her &s;incerity in her
intentions to marry; that the appointment of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or would be
attended with great danger to her per&s;on; that &s;he her&s;elf had bad
ex|perience, <PB N="471" REF="74"> during the reign of her &s;i&s;ter, how much
court was paid to the next heir, and what dangerous &s;acrifices men were
commonly di&s;po&s;ed to make of their pre&s;ent duty to their future

debate on that &s;ubject. Paul Wentworth, a &s;pirited mem|ber, went &s;o far
as to que&s;tion whether &s;uch a prohibition were not an infringe|ment of the
liberties and privileges of the hou&s;e<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

they had hitherto pre&s;erved to the Queen; and affirm|ed that &s;he was bound
in duty, not only to provide for the happine&s;s of her &s;ub|jects during her
own life, but al&s;o to pay regard to their future &s;ecurity, by fixing a

&s;ub&s;i&s;t than &s;he &s;hould enjoy the glory and &s;atisfaction of
governing it; that none but timorous princes, or tyrants, or faint hearted
women, ever &s;tood in fear of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; and that the affections
of the people were a firm and impregnable rampart to every &s;overeign, who,
laying a&s;ide all artifice or by ends, had courage and magnanimity to put his
&s;ole tru&s;t in that honourable and &s;ure defence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 400.</NOTE>. The Queen, hearing of the&s;e debates,
&s;ent for the &s;peaker, and after reiterating her former prohibition, &s;he
bid him inform the hou&s;e, that, if any member remained &s;till un&s;atisfied,
he might appear before the privy council, and there give his rea&s;ons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 128.</NOTE>. As the members &s;howed a

revoke them, and to allow the hou&s;e liberty of debate<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 130.</NOTE>. They were &s;o mollified by
this gracious conde&s;cen&s;ion, that they thenceforth conducted the matter

<P>ELIZABETH carried farther her dignity on this occa&s;ion. She
had received the &s;ub&s;idy without any condition; but as it was believed,
that the commons had given her that gratuity with a view of engaging her to
yield to their reque&s;ts, &s;he thought proper, on her refu&s;al, to remit

<P>BUT tho' the Queen was able to elude, for the pre&s;ent, the

mo&s;t of the con&s;iderable men in England, except Cecil, &s;eemed convinced

as the marriage of the former &s;eemed liable to &s;ome objections, and had
been declared invalid, men were alarmed, even on that &s;ide, with the
pro&s;pect of new di&s;putes concerning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Mary's behaviour
al&s;o, &s;o moderate towards the prote&s;tants, and &s;o gracious towards all

a&s;cribe any imprudences, into which &s;he had fallen, to her youth and

purpo&s;e to vi&s;it him during his &s;ickne&s;s, that &s;he behaved towards

that &s;he appeared thenceforth determined to live with him on a &s;ooting more
<PB N="474" REF="77"> &s;uitable to the connexions between them. Henry,
naturally uxorious, and not mi&s;tru&s;ting this &s;udden reconcilement, put
him&s;elf implicitly into her hands, and attended her to Edinburgh. She lived
in the palace of Holy-rood-hou&s;e; but as the &s;ituation of that place was
low, and the concour&s;e of per&s;ons about the court was nece&s;&s;arily
attended with noi&s;e, which might di&s;turb him in his pre&s;ent infirm
&s;tate of health, the&s;e rea&s;ons were a&s;&s;igned for fitting up an
apartment for him in a &s;olitary hou&s;e, at &s;ome di&s;tance, called the
Kirk of Field. Mary here gave him marks of kindne&s;s and attachment; &s;he
conver&s;ed cordially with him; and &s;he lay &s;ome nights in a room below
his; but on the ninth of February, &s;he told him, that &s;he would pa&s;s that
night in the palace, becau&s;e the marriage of one of her &s;ervants was there

<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Fe|bruary.</NOTE> About two o'clock in

his favour with Mary was open and vi&s;ible, and his power great, no one
ventured to declare openly his &s;entiments, and all men remained in &s;ilence

<P>THE earl of Lenox, who lived at a di&s;tance from the court, in
poverty and contempt, was rouzed by the report of his &s;on's murder, and wrote
to the Queen, imploring &s;peedy ju&s;tice again&s;t the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins;
among whom he named the earl of <PB N="475" REF="78"> Bothwel, Sir James

&s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s all his wonted confidence and familiarity with her.
Even the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, a place of great con&s;equence, in this
critical time, was entru&s;ted to his creature, Sir James Balfour, who had
him&s;elf been publickly charged as an accomplice in the King's murder<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;+wood, p. 201.</NOTE>. Lenox, who had come as
far as Stirling, with a view of appearing at the trial, was informed of all
the&s;e circum&s;tances; and reflecting on the &s;mall train, which attended
him, he began to entertain very ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions from the power,
in&s;olence, and te|merity of his enemy. He wrote to Mary, de&s;iring that the
day of trial might be prorogued; and conjured her, by all the regard which

determining a que&s;tion of &s;uch extreme moment<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 375. Ander&s;on, vol. I. p. 52.</NOTE>. No regard was
paid to his application: The jury was enclo&s;ed, of which the earl of
Caithne&s;s was chancellor; and tho' Lenox, fore&s;eeing the precipitation, had
ordered Cunningham, one of his retinue, to ap|pear in court, and prote&s;t, in

<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th April.</NOTE> The &s;entence was &s;uch
as it behoved them to give, where neither accu&s;er nor witne&s;s appeared; and
Bothwel was ab&s;olved from the King's murder. The jury, however,
apprehen&s;ive that their &s;entence would give great &s;candal, and perhaps
expo&s;e them afterwards to &s;ome danger, entered a prote&s;t, in which they
repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of their proceedings<NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 201. Ander&s;on, vol. I. p. 113.</NOTE>. It is
remarkable, that the indictment was laid again&s;t Bothwel for committing the

generally put upon this error, too gro&s;s, it was thought, to have proceeded
from mi&s;take, was, that the &s;ecret council, by whom Mary was governed, not
tru&s;ting entirely to precipitation, violence, and <PB N="476" REF="79">
authority, had provided this plea, by which they en&s;ured, at all adventures,
a plau&s;ible pretence for acquitting Bothwel.</P>
<P>TWO days after this extraordinary tran&s;action, a Parliament
was held; and tho' the &s;entence in favour of Bothwel was attended with &s;uch
circum&s;tances as &s;trongly confirmed, rather than dimini&s;hed, the general
opinion of his guilt, he was the per&s;on cho&s;en to carry the royal &s;cepter

no notice was taken of the King's mur|der<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Keith,

which e&s;tabli&s;hed the prote&s;tant religion; a conce&s;&s;ion which &s;he
could never before be brought to make.</NOTE>. The favour, which Mary openly
bore to Bothwel, kept every one in awe; and the effects of this terror appeared
more plainly in another tran&s;action, which en&s;ued immediately upon the
di&s;&s;olution of the Parliament. A bond or a&s;&s;ociation was framed; in
which the &s;ub&s;cribers, after relating the acquital of Both|wel by a legal
trial, and a farther offer, which he had made, to prove his inno|cence by

this promi&s;e, which implied no great a&s;&s;urance in Both|wel of his own
innocence, the &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cribers
mentioned the nece&s;&s;ity of their Queen's marriage, in order to &s;upport

<P>THE &s;ub&s;equent mea&s;ures of Bothwel were equally
precipitant and audacious. Mary having gone to Stirling to pay a vi&s;it to her
&s;on, he a&s;&s;embled a body of eight hundred hor&s;e, under pretence of
pur&s;uing &s;ome robbers on the borders, and having way-laid her on her
return, he &s;eized her per&s;on near Edinburgh, and carried her to Dunbar,
with an avowed de&s;ign of forcing her to yield to his purpo&s;e. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th April.</NOTE> Sir James Melvil, who was
in her retinue, was carried along with her; and &s;ays not, that he &s;aw any
&s;igns of reluctance or con&s;traint: He was even informed, as he tells us, by
one of Bothwel's officers, that the whole tran&s;action was managed in concert
with her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 80.</NOTE>. A woman, indeed, of
that &s;pirit and re&s;o|lution, which is acknowledged to belong to Mary, does
not u&s;ually, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, give &s;uch marks of oppo&s;ition to
real violence, as can appear any wi&s;e doubtful or ambiguous. Some of the
nobility, however, in order to put mat|ters to farther trial, &s;ent her a
private me&s;&s;age; in which they told her, that, if in reality &s;he lay
under force, they would u&s;e all their efforts to relieve her. Her an&s;wer
was, that &s;he had indeed been carried to Dunbar by violence; but &s;ince her
arrival had been &s;o well treated there, that &s;he willingly remained with
Bothwel<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 202.</NOTE>. No one gave
them&s;elves thenceforth any &s;olicitude to relieve her from a captivity,
which they believed to have proceeded entirely from her own approbation and
connivance.</P>
<P>THIS unu&s;ual conduct was at fir&s;t a&s;cribed to Mary's
&s;en&s;e of the infamy, attend|ing her purpo&s;ed marriage; and her de&s;ire
of finding &s;ome colour to glo&s;s over the irregularity of her conduct. But a
pardon given to Bothwel a few days afterwards, made the public carry &s;omewhat
farther their conjectures. In this deed, Bothwel received a remi&s;&s;ion for
the violence committed on the Queen's per&s;on; and for <HI>all other
crimes:</HI> A clau&s;e, by which the murder of the King was indirectly
pardoned. The rape was then conjectured to be only a contrivance of the&s;e
politicians, in order to afford a pretence for indirectly remitting a crime, of
which they dur&s;t not openly make any mention<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 61.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE events pa&s;&s;ed with &s;uch rapidity, that men had no
lei&s;ure to admire &s;ufficiently one incident, when they were &s;urprized
with a new one, equally rare and uncommon. There &s;till, however, remained one
difficulty, which, it was not ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, how the Queen and Bothwel,
determined as they were to execute their &s;hameful purpo&s;e, could find
expedients to overcome. The man, who had procured the &s;ub&s;cription of the
nobility, recommending him as a hu&s;|band <PB N="478" REF="81"> to the Queen,
and who had acted this &s;eeming violence on her per&s;on, in order to force
her con&s;ent, had been married &s;ix months before to another wo|man; to a
woman of merit, of a very noble family, &s;i&s;ter to the earl of Hunt|ley. But
per&s;ons blinded with pa&s;&s;ion, and infatuated with crimes, &s;oon &s;hake
off all appearance of decency. A &s;uit was commenced for a divorce between
Bothwel and his wife; and this &s;uit was opened at the &s;ame in&s;tant in two
differ|ent, or rather oppo&s;ite courts; in the court of the archbi&s;hop of
St. Andrews, which was popi&s;h, and governed it&s;elf by the canon law; and in
the new con|&s;i&s;torial or commi&s;&s;ariot court, which was prote&s;tant,
and was regulated by the principles of the reformed teachers. The plea advanced
in each court, was &s;o calculated as to &s;uit the principles which there
prevailed: In the archbi&s;hop's court, the pretence of con&s;anguinity was
employed, becau&s;e Bothwel was related to his wife in the fourth degree; in
the commi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ariot court, the
accu&s;ation of adultery was made u&s;e of again&s;t him. The parties too who
applied for the di|vorce, were different in the different courts: Bothwel was
the per&s;on who &s;ued in the former; his wife in the latter. And the &s;uit
in both courts was opened, pleaded, examined, and decided with the utmo&s;t
precipitation, and a &s;entence of divorce was pronounced in four days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. II. p. 280.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE divorce being thus obtained, it was thought proper that Mary
&s;hould be conducted to Edinburgh, and &s;hould there appear before the courts
of judica|ture, and &s;hould acknowlege her&s;elf to be re&s;tored to entire
freedom. This was under&s;tood to be contrived with a view of obviating all
doubts with regard to the validity of her marriage. Orders were then given to
publi&s;h the banns in the church, between the Queen and the duke of Orkney;
for that was the title which he now bore; and Craig, a mini&s;ter of Edinburgh,
was applied to for that purpo&s;e. This clergyman, not content with having, for
&s;ome time, refu&s;ed compliance, publicly in his &s;ermons condemned the
marriage; and exhorted all tho&s;e who had acce&s;s to the Queen, to give her
their advice again&s;t &s;o &s;candalous an alliance. Being called before the
council, to an&s;wer for this liberty, he &s;howed a courage which might cover
the whole nobles with &s;hame, on account of their tamene&s;s and &s;ervility.
He &s;aid, that, by the rules of the church, the earl of Both|wel, being
convicted of adultery, could not be permitted to marry; that the divorce
between him and his former wife, was plainly procured by collu&s;ion, as
appeared by the precipitation of that &s;entence, and the &s;udden conclu&s;ion
of his marriage with the Queen; and that all the &s;u&s;picions which
prevailed, with re|gard to the King's murder, and the Queen's concurrence in
the former rape, <PB N="479" REF="82"> would thence receive undoubted
confirmation. He therefore exhorted Bothwel, who was pre&s;ent, no longer to
per&s;evere in his pre&s;ent criminal enterprizes; and turning his
di&s;cour&s;e to the other coun&s;ellors, he charged them to employ all their
influence with the Queen, in diverting her from a mea&s;ure which would cover
her with infamy and di&s;honour. Not &s;atisfied even with this admonition, he
took the fir&s;t opportunity of informing the public, from the pulpit, of this
whole tran&s;action, and expre&s;&s;ed to them his fears, that,
notwith&s;tanding all remon|&s;trances, their &s;overeign was &s;till
ob&s;tinately bent on her fatal purpo&s;e. 
<Q REND="inline">"For him&s;elf," he &s;aid, "he had already
di&s;charged his con&s;cience, and yet again would take heaven and earth to
witne&s;s, that he abhorred and dete&s;ted that marriage, as &s;candalous and
hateful in the &s;ight of mankind: But &s;ince the Great, as he perceived,
either by their flattery or &s;ilence, gave countenance to the mea&s;ure, he
be&s;ought the Faithful to pray fervently to the Almighty, that a re&s;olution,
which was taken contrary to all law, rea&s;on, and good con&s;cience, might, by
the divine ble&s;&s;ing, be turned to the comfort and benefit of the church and
kingdom."</Q> The&s;e &s;peeches offended the court extremely; and Craig was
anew &s;ummoned before the council, to an&s;wer for his temerity in thus
pa&s;&s;ing the bounds of his commi&s;&s;ion. But he told them, that the bounds
of his commi&s;&s;ion were the word of God, good laws, and natural rea&s;on;
and were the Queen's marriage tried by any of the&s;e three &s;tandards, it
would appear infamous and di&s;honourable, and would be &s;o e&s;teemed by the
whole world. The council were &s;o overawed by this heroic behaviour in a
private clergyman, that they di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed him without farther cen&s;ure or
puni&s;hment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 203. Ander&s;on, vol. II.

<P>BUT tho' this tran&s;action might have recalled Bothwel and the
Queen of Scots, from their infatuation, and might have in&s;tructed them in the
di&s;po&s;itions of the people, as well as their own inability to oppo&s;e

<P>THE news of the&s;e tran&s;actions, being carried to foreign

principal actors in them, but al&s;o on the whole nation, who &s;eemed, by

to give their &s;anction to the&s;e &s;candalous practices<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 82. Keith, p. 402. Ander&s;on, vol. I. p. 128,

they dur&s;t no where appear in public; and they earne&s;tly exhorted their

pu|ni&s;hment the authors of &s;uch atrocious crimes. This intelligence, with a
little more lei&s;ure for reflection, rou&s;ed men at la&s;t from their
lethargy; and the ru|mours, which from the very beginning<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Crawford, p. 11. Keith, Pref. p. 9.</NOTE>, had been &s;pread
again&s;t Mary, as if &s;he had concurred in the King's murder, &s;eemed now,
by the &s;ub&s;equent tran&s;|actions, to have received a &s;trong confirmation
and authority. It was every where &s;aid, that, even tho' no particular and
direct proofs had as yet been produced of the Queen's guilt, the whole tenor of
her late conduct was &s;ufficient, not only to beget &s;u&s;picion, but to
produce entire conviction again&s;t her: That her &s;ud|den re&s;olution of
being reconciled to her hu&s;band, whom before &s;he had long and ju&s;tly
hated; her bringing him to court, from which &s;he had bani&s;hed him by
neglects and rigours; her fitting up &s;eparate apartments for him; were all of
them circum&s;tances, which, tho' trivial in them&s;elves, yet, being compared
with the following events, bore a very unfavourable a&s;pect for her: That the
lea&s;t which, after the King's murder, might have been expected in her
&s;ituation, was a more than u&s;ual caution in her mea&s;ures, and an extreme
anxiety to puni&s;h the real a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, in order to free her&s;elf from
all reproach and &s;u&s;picion: That no wo|man, who had any regard to her
character, would allow a man, publicly accu&s;ed of her hu&s;band's murder,
&s;o much as to approach her pre&s;ence, far le&s;s give him a &s;hare in her
councils, and endow him with favour and authority: That an acquital merely in
the ab&s;ence of accu&s;ers, was very ill fitted to &s;atisfy the public;
e&s;pecially if that ab&s;ence proceeded from a de&s;igned precipitation of the
&s;entence, and from the terror which her known friend&s;hip for the criminal
had infu&s;ed into every one: That the very mention of her marriage to &s;uch a
per&s;on, in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, was horrible; and the contrivance of
extorting a con&s;ent of the no|bility, and of concerting a rape, were gro&s;s
artifices, more proper to betray her guilt than prove her innocence: That where
a woman thus &s;hews a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of merited reproach, and, in&s;tead

her exceptionable conduct, &s;he betrays a neglect of fame, which mu&s;t
ei|ther be the effect or the cau&s;e of the mo&s;t &s;hameful enormities: That
to e&s;pou&s;e a man, who had a few days before been &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly
divorced from his wife; who, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, was believed to have, a few
months before, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated her hu&s;band, was &s;o contrary to the
plaine&s;t rules of behaviour, that no pretence of in|di&s;cretion or
imprudence could account for &s;uch a conduct: That a woman, who, &s;o &s;oon
after her hu&s;band's death, tho' not attended with any extraordinary
circum|&s;tances, contracts a marriage which might, in it&s;elf, be the mo&s;t
blamele&s;s, can|not e&s;cape &s;evere cen&s;ure; but one who overlooks, for
her plea&s;ure, &s;o many other weighty con&s;iderations, was equally capable,
in gratifying her appetites, to ne|glect every regard to honour, and to
humanity: That Mary was not ignorant of the prevailing opinion of the public,
with regard to her own guilt, and of the inferences which would every where be
drawn from her conduct; and therefore, if &s;he &s;till continued to pur&s;ue
mea&s;ures which gave &s;uch ju&s;t offence, &s;he ratified, by her actions, as
much as by the mo&s;t formal confe&s;&s;ion, all the &s;urmizes and imputations
of her enemies: That the only circum&s;tance which oppo&s;ed all the&s;e
pre&s;umptions, was, the benignity and goodne&s;s of her preceding behaviour,
which &s;eemed to remove her from all &s;u&s;picion of &s;uch atrocious
inhumanity; but that the characters of men were extremely variable, and the
per&s;ons who were guilty of the wor&s;t actions, were not always naturally of
the wor&s;t and mo&s;t cri|minal di&s;po&s;itions: That a woman, who, in a
critical and dangerous moment, had &s;acrificed her honour to a man of
abandoned principles, might thenceforth be led blindfold by him to the
commi&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t enormous crimes, and was in reality no longer at
her own di&s;po&s;al: And that tho' one &s;uppo&s;ition was &s;till left to
alleviate her blame, viz. that Bothwel, pre&s;uming on her affection towards
him, had of him&s;elf committed the crime, and had never communicated it to
her, yet &s;uch a &s;udden and pa&s;&s;ionate love to a man whom &s;he had long
known, could not ea&s;ily be accounted for, without &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome degree
of preceding guilt; and as it appeared that &s;he was not afterwards
re&s;trained, either by &s;hame or prudence, from incurring the highe&s;t
reproach and danger, it was not likely, that a &s;en&s;e of duty or humanity
would have a more powerful influence over her.</P>
<P>THESE were the general &s;entiments which prevailed throughout
Scotland; and as the prote&s;tant teachers, who had great authority, had long
borne a great ani|mo&s;ity towards Mary, the opinion of her guilt was, by that
means, the more widely diffu&s;ed, and made the deeper impre&s;&s;ion on every
one. Some attempts made by Bothwel, and, as it is pretended, with her
con&s;ent, to get the young prince into his power, excited the mo&s;t &s;erious
attention; and the principal nobility, even many of tho&s;e who had formerly
been con&s;trained to &s;ign the application in <PB N="482" REF="85"> favour of
Bothwel's marriage, met at Stirling, and formed an a&s;&s;ociation for

Grange, Tullibardine, and &s;ecretary Lidington, entered zealou&s;ly into it.
The earl of Murray, fore&s;eeing &s;uch turbulent times, and be|ing de&s;irous

been lawfully married to the late King of Scots, &s;he naturally bore an
animo&s;ity to Mary, and treated her with the utmo&s;t har&s;h|ne&s;s and
&s;everity.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, who was exactly informed of all tho&s;e events,
&s;eemed touched with compa&s;&s;ion towards the unfortunate Queen; and as all
her fears and jealou|&s;ies were now laid a&s;leep, by the con&s;ideration of
that ruin and infamy in which Mary's conduct had involved her, &s;he began to
reflect on the in&s;tability of hu|man affairs, the precarious &s;tate of royal
grandeur, the danger of encouraging rebellious &s;ubjects; and &s;he re&s;olved
to employ her authority for alleviating the calamities of her unhappy
&s;i&s;ter. She &s;ent Sir Nicholas Throcmorton amba&s;&s;a|dor to Scotland, in
order to remon&s;trate both with Mary and the a&s;&s;ociated lords; and &s;he
gave him in&s;tructions which, tho' mixt with &s;ome lofty preten|&s;ions, were
full of that good &s;en&s;e which was &s;o natural to her, and of that
genero|&s;ity which the pre&s;ent intere&s;ting &s;ituation had called forth.
She empowered him to declare in her name to Mary, that the late conduct of that
prince&s;s, &s;o enormous, and in every re&s;pect &s;o unju&s;tifiable, had
given her the highe&s;t offence; and tho' &s;he felt the movements of pity
towards her, &s;he had once determined never to interpo&s;e in her affairs,
either by advice or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but to abandon her entirely, as a
per&s;on who&s;e condition was totally de&s;perate, and honour irretrieveable:
That &s;he was well a&s;&s;ured, that other foreign princes, Mary's near
relations, had em|braced the &s;ame re&s;olution; but, for her part, the late
events had touched her heart with more tender &s;ympathy, and had made her
adopt mea&s;ures more fa|vourable to the liberty and intere&s;ts of the unhappy
Queen: That &s;he was de|termined not to &s;ee her oppre&s;&s;ed by her
rebellious &s;ubjects, but would employ all her good offices, and even her
power, to redeem her from captivity, and place her in &s;uch a condition as
would at once be compatible with her dignity, and the <PB N="484" REF="87">
&s;afety of her &s;ubjects: That &s;he entreated her to lay a&s;ide all
thoughts of re|venge, except again&s;t the murderers of her hu&s;band; and as
&s;he her&s;elf was his near relation, &s;he was better entitled than the
&s;ubjects of Mary to interpo&s;e her authority on that head, and &s;he
therefore be&s;ought that prince&s;s, if &s;he had any regard to her own honour
and &s;afety, not to oppo&s;e &s;o ju&s;t and rea&s;onable a de|mand: That
after tho&s;e two points were provided for, her own liberty, and the
puni&s;hment of her hu&s;band's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, the &s;afety of her infant
&s;on was next to be con&s;idered; and there &s;eemed no expedient more proper
for that purpo&s;e, than the &s;ending him to be educated in England: And that
be&s;ides the &s;ecurity which would attend his removal from all factions and
convul&s;ions, there were many other beneficial con&s;equences, which it was
ea&s;y to fore&s;ee as the re&s;ult of his education in that country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 411, 412, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE remon&s;trances which Throcmorton was in&s;tructed to make
to the a&s;&s;oci|ated lords, were entirely conformable to the&s;e &s;entiments
which Elizabeth enter|tained in Mary's favour. She empowered him to tell them,
that whatever blame &s;he might throw on Mary's conduct, any oppo&s;ition to
their &s;overeign was totally unju&s;tifiable, and incompatible with all order
and good government: That it belonged not to them to reform, much le&s;s to
puni&s;h, the mal-admini&s;tration of their prince; and the only arms which
&s;ubjects could in any ca&s;e lawfully em|ploy again&s;t the &s;upreme
authority, were entreaties, councils, and repre&s;entations: That if the&s;e
expedients failed, they were next to appeal by their prayers to Hea|ven; and to
wait with patience till the Almighty, in who&s;e hands are the hearts of
princes, &s;hould be plea&s;ed to turn them to ju&s;tice and to mercy: That
&s;he inculcated not this doctrine becau&s;e &s;he her&s;elf was intere&s;ted
in its ob&s;ervance; but becau&s;e it was univer&s;ally received in all well
governed &s;tates, and was e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of civil
&s;ociety: That &s;he required them to re&s;tore their Queen to liberty; and
promi&s;ed, in that ca&s;e, to concur with them in all proper expedients for
regulating the government, for puni&s;hing the King's mur|derers, and for
guarding the life and liberty of the infant prince: And that if the &s;ervices
which &s;he had lately conferred on the Scoti&s;h nation, in protecting them
from foreign u&s;urpation, were duly con&s;idered by them, they would repo&s;e
confidence in her good offices, and would e&s;teem them&s;elves blame-worthy,
in never having as yet made any application to her<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 414, 415, 42<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, be&s;ides the&s;e remon&s;trances, &s;ent by
Throcmorton &s;ome articles of accommodation, which he was to propo&s;e to both
parties, as expedients for the &s;ettlement of public affairs; and tho' the&s;e
articles included &s;ome con&s;iderable <PB N="485" REF="88"> re&s;traints on
the &s;overeign power, they were in the main calculated for Mary's advantage,
and were &s;ufficiently indulgent to her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keith, p.
416.</NOTE>. The a&s;&s;ociated lords, who were determined to proceed with
greater &s;everity, were apprehen&s;ive of Eli|zabeth's partiality; and being
&s;en&s;ible, that Mary would take courage from the protection of that powerful
prince&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 427.</NOTE>, they thought
proper, after &s;everal affect|ed delays, to refu&s;e the Engli&s;h
amba&s;&s;ador all acce&s;s to her per&s;on. There were four different
&s;chemes propo&s;ed in Scotland, for the treatment of the captive Queen: One,
that &s;he &s;hould be re&s;tored to her authority under very &s;trict
limi|tations: The &s;econd, that &s;he &s;hould be obliged to re&s;ign her
crown to the prince, be bani&s;hed the kingdom, and be confined either to
France or England; with a&s;&s;urance from the &s;overeign in who&s;e dominions
&s;he &s;hould re&s;ide, that &s;he &s;hould make no attempts to the
di&s;turbance of the e&s;tabli&s;hed government: The third, that &s;he &s;hould
be publicly tried for her crimes, of which her enemies pre|tended to have
undoubted proof and be condemned to perpetual impri&s;onment: The fourth was
&s;till more &s;evere, and required, that, after her condemnation, capital
puni&s;hment &s;hould be inflicted upon her<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 420.</NOTE>. Throcmorton &s;upported the milde&s;t
propo&s;al; but tho' he promi&s;ed his mi&s;tre&s;s's guarantee for the
perform|ance of articles, threatned them with immediate vengeance in ca&s;e of
refu&s;al<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">8.</NOTE>, and warned them not to draw
on them&s;elves, by their violence, the public re|proach, which now lay upon
the Queen; he found, that excepting &s;ecretary Li|dington, he had not the good
fortune to convince any of the leaders. All coun|cils &s;eemed to tend towards
the more &s;evere expedients; and the preachers, in particular, drawing their
examples from the rigorous maxims of the Old Te&s;ta|ment, which can only be
warranted by particular revelations, inflamed the minds of the people again&s;t
their unhappy &s;overeign<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 422,

<P>THERE were &s;everal pretenders to the regency of the young
prince, after the intended depo&s;ition of Mary. The earl of Lenox claimed that
authority as grandfather to the prince: The duke of Chatelrault, who was
ab&s;ent in France, had preten&s;ions as next heir to the crown: But the
greate&s;t number of the a&s;&s;o|ciated lords inclined to the earl of Murray,
in who&s;e capacity they had the great|e&s;t tru&s;t, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
the entire confidence of the preachers and more zea|lous reformers. All
mea&s;ures being therefore concerted, three in&s;truments were &s;ent to Mary,
by the hands of lord Linde&s;ey and Sir Robert Melvil; by one of which &s;he
was to re&s;ign the crown in &s;avour of her &s;on, by another to appoint
Murray regent, by the third to name a Council, which &s;hould admini&s;ter the
go|vernment <PB N="486" REF="89"> till his arrival in Scotland. The Queen of
Scots, &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of relief, lying ju&s;tly under apprehen&s;ions
of her life, and believing, that no deed, which &s;he executed during her
captivity, could be valid, was prevailed on, after a plentiful effu&s;ion of
tears, to &s;ign the&s;e three in&s;truments; and &s;he took not the trouble of
in&s;pecting any one of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 85.
Spot&s;wood, p. 211. Ander&s;on, vol. III. p. 19.</NOTE>. In con&s;equence of

of James the &s;ixth. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th July.</NOTE> He was &s;oon after crowned
at Stirling, and the earl of Mor|ton took in his name the oath of Coronation;
in which a promi&s;e to extirpate here&s;y was not forgot. Some republican

ceremony<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 439, 44<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>; and a coin was &s;oon after &s;truck, on which

<P>THE council of regency had not long occa&s;ion to exerci&s;e
their authority. The earl of Murray arrived from France, and took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his high office. He paid a vi&s;it to the captive Queen;
and &s;poke to her in a manner which better &s;uited her pa&s;t conduct than
her pre&s;ent condition. This har&s;h treatment quite extinqui&s;hed in her
brea&s;t any remains of affection towards him<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 87. Keith, p. 445.</NOTE>. Murray pro|ceeded afterwards
to break, in a more public manner, all terms of decency with her. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th of De|cember.</NOTE> He &s;ummoned a
Parliament; and that a&s;&s;embly, after voting that &s;he was undoubtedly an
accomplice in her hu&s;band's murder, condemned her to im|pri&s;onment,
ratified her dimi&s;&s;ion of the crown, and acknowleged her &s;on for King,
and Murray for regent<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. II. p.

employed him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;sfully in reducing the kingdom. He bribed Sir
James Balfour to &s;urrender the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh: He con&s;trained the
gar|ri&s;on of Dunbar to open their gates: And he demoli&s;hed that
fortre&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT tho' every thing thus bore a favourable a&s;pect to the new
government, and all men &s;eemed to &s;ubmit to Murray's authority; a violent
revolution, however nece&s;&s;ary, can never be effected without great
di&s;contents; and it was not likely, that in a country, where the government,
in its mo&s;t &s;ettled &s;tate, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very disjointed authority,
a new e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;hould meet with no interruption or di&s;turbance.
Few con&s;iderable men of the nation &s;eemed willing to &s;upport Mary, &s;o
long as Bothwel was pre&s;ent; but the removal of that obnoxious no|bleman had
altered the &s;entiments of many. The duke of Chatelrault, being di&s;appointed
of the regency, bore no good will to Murray and his coun&s;ellors; 
<PB N="487" REF="90"> and the &s;ame &s;entiments were embraced by all his
numerous retainers: Several of the nobility, finding that others had taken the
lead among the a&s;&s;ociators, formed a faction apart, and oppo&s;ed the
prevailing power: And be&s;ides &s;ome re|mains of duty and affection towards
Mary, the malecontent lords, finding every thing carried to extremity again&s;t
her, were naturally led to embrace her cau&s;e, and &s;helter them&s;elves
under her authority. All tho&s;e who retained any propen&s;ity to the catholic
religion were inclined to join this party; and even the people in general, tho'
they had formerly either dete&s;ted Mary's crimes, or blamed her imprudence,
were now moved by her misfortunes to compa&s;&s;ionate her pre&s;ent
&s;ituation, and lamented, that a per&s;on, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o many
amiable accompli&s;h|ments, joined to &s;uch high dignity, &s;hould be treated
with &s;uch extreme rigour and &s;everity<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Buchan. lib. xviii. c. 53.</NOTE>, Animated by all the&s;e

<P><MILESTONE N="1568" UNIT="year"> WHILE the&s;e humours were in

&s;he engaged, by her charms and care&s;&s;es, a young gentleman, George
Douglas, brother to the laird of Lochlevin, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in that
enterprize. She even went &s;o far as to give him hopes of e&s;pou&s;ing her,
after her marriage with Bothwel &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved on the plea of force;
and &s;he propo&s;ed this expedient to the regent, who rejected it. Douglas,
however, per|&s;evered in his endeavours to free her from captivity; and having
all opportunities of acce&s;s to the hou&s;e, he was at la&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful

forces. A bond of a&s;&s;ociation for her defence was &s;igned by the earls of

entrance of French troops into the kingdom, &s;he de&s;ired that the
controver&s;y between the Queen of Scots and her &s;ubjects might by that
prince&s;s be referred entirely to her arbitration, and that no foreign
&s;uccours &s;hould be introduced into Scotland<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 473. in the notes. Ander&s;on, vol. IV. p.

<P>BUT Elizabeth had not leizure to exert fully her efforts in
favour of Mary. The regent made ha&s;te to a&s;&s;emble forces; and
notwith&s;tanding that his army was inferior in number to that of the Queen of
Scots, he took the field again&s;t her. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th May.</NOTE> A battle was fought at
Lang&s;ide near Gla&s;gow, which was entirely deci&s;ive in favour of the
a&s;&s;ociated lords; and tho' the regent, after his victory, &s;topt the
blood&s;hed, yet was the action followed by a total di&s;per&s;ion of the
Queen's party. That unhappy prince&s;s fled &s;outhwards from the field of
battle with great precipita|tion, and came, with a few attendants, to the
borders of England. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mary flies into England.</NOTE> She here
delibe|rated concerning her next mea&s;ures, which would probably prove &s;o
important to her future happine&s;s or mi&s;ery. She found it impo&s;&s;ible to
remain in her own kingdom: She had an aver&s;ion, in her pre&s;ent wretched
condition, to return into France, where &s;he had formerly appeared with &s;o
much &s;plendour; and was not, be&s;ides, provided of a ve&s;&s;el, which could
&s;afely convey her thither: The late generous behaviour of Elizabeth made her
hope for defence, and even a&s;&s;i&s;tance, from that quarter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jebb's Collection, vol. I. p. 420.</NOTE>; and as the
pre&s;ent fears of her dome&s;tic enemies were the mo&s;t urgent, &s;he
overlooked all other con&s;iderations, and embraced the re&s;olution of taking
&s;helter in England. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th May.</NOTE> She embarked on board a
fi&s;hing-boat in Galloway, and landed the &s;ame day at Wirkington in
Cumberland, about thirty miles di&s;|tant from Carli&s;le; whence &s;he
immediately di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to London; notifying her arrival,
de&s;iring liberty to vi&s;it Elizabeth, and craving her protection, in
con&s;equence of former profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, made her by that
prince&s;s.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH now found her&s;elf in a &s;ituation, when it was
become nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome deci&s;ive re&s;olution with regard to her
treatment of the Queen of Scots; and as &s;he had hitherto, contrary to the
opinion of Cecil, attended more to the motives of genero&s;ity than of
policy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cabala, p. 140.</NOTE>, &s;he was engaged
by that prudent mini&s;ter to weigh anew all the con&s;iderations, which
occurred in this critical conjuncture. <PB N="489" REF="92"> He repre&s;ented,
that the party, which had dethroned Mary, and had at pre&s;ent a&s;&s;umed the
government of Scotland, were always the partizans of the Engli&s;h alliance,
and were engaged, by all the motives of religion and of intere&s;t, to
per|&s;evere in their connexions with Elizabeth: That tho' Murray and his
friends might complain of &s;ome unkind u&s;age during their bani&s;hment in
England, they would ea&s;ily forget the&s;e grounds of quarrel, when they
con&s;idered, that Elizabeth was the only ally, on whom they could &s;afely
depend, and that their own Queen, by her attachment to the catholic faith, and
by her other connexions, excluded them entirely from the friend&s;hip of
France, and even from that of Spain: That Mary, on the other hand, even before
her violent breach with her prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, was in &s;ecret entirely
governed by the coun&s;els of the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e; much more, would &s;he
implicitly comply with their views, when by her own mi&s;conduct the power of
that family and of the zealous catholics was become her &s;ole re&s;ource and
&s;ecurity: That her preten&s;ions to the Engli&s;h crown would render her a
very dangerous in&s;trument in their hands; and were &s;he once able to
&s;uppre&s;s the prote&s;tants in her own kingdom, &s;he would unite the Scotch
and Engli&s;h catholics, with tho&s;e of all foreign &s;tates, in one
confederacy again&s;t the religion and government of England: That it behoved
Elizabeth therefore to proceed with caution in the de&s;ign of re&s;toring her
rival to the throne; and to take care, both that that enterprize, if
undertaken, &s;hould be effected by Engli&s;h forces alone, and that full
&s;ecurities &s;hould beforehand be provided for the re|formers and the
reformation in Scotland: That above all, it was requi&s;ite to guard carefully
the per&s;on of that prince&s;s; le&s;t, finding this unexpected re&s;erve in
the Engli&s;h friend&s;hip, &s;he &s;hould &s;uddenly take the re&s;olution of
flying into France, and &s;hould attempt by foreign force to recover
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her authority: That her de&s;perate fortunes and broken
reputation fitted her for any attempt; and her re&s;entment, when &s;he
&s;hould find her&s;elf thus de&s;erted by the Queen, would concur with her
ambition and her bigotry, and render her an unrelenting, as well as powerful,
enemy to the Engli&s;h government: That if &s;he was once abroad, in the hands
of enterprizing catholics, the attack of England would appear to her as ea&s;y
as that of Scotland; and the only method, &s;he mu&s;t imagine, of recovering
her native kingdom, would be to acquire that crown, to which &s;he would
e&s;teem her&s;elf equally intitled: That a neutrality in &s;uch intere&s;ting
&s;itua|tions, tho' it might be pretended, could never, without the mo&s;t
extreme danger, be upheld by the Queen; and the detention of Mary was equally
requi&s;ite, whe|ther the power of England were to be employed in her favour,
or again&s;t her: That nothing indeed was more becoming a great prince than
genero&s;ity; yet the &s;ugge&s;tions of this noble principle could never,
without the utmo&s;t imprudence, be <PB N="490" REF="93"> con&s;ulted in &s;uch
delicate circum&s;tances as tho&s;e in which the Queen was at pre|&s;ent
placed; where her own &s;afety and the intere&s;ts of her people were
intimately concerned in every re&s;olution which &s;he embraced: That tho' the
example of &s;ucce&s;sful rebellion, e&s;pecially in a neighbouring country,
could be no wi&s;e agree|able to any &s;overeign, yet Mary's imprudence had
been &s;o great, perhaps her crimes &s;o enormous, that the in&s;urrection of
&s;ubjects, after &s;uch provocation, could no longer be regarded as a
precedent again&s;t other princes: That it was fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for
Elizabeth to a&s;certain, in a regular and &s;atisfactory manner, the extent of
Mary's guilt, and thence to determine the degree of protection which &s;he
ought to afford her, again&s;t her di&s;contented &s;ubjects: That as no glory
could &s;urpa&s;s that of defending oppre&s;&s;ed innocence, it was equally
infamous to patronize vice and murder on the throne; and the contagion of
&s;uch di&s;|honour would extend it&s;elf to all who countenanced or
&s;upported it: And that if the crimes of the Scotch prince&s;s &s;hould, on
enquiry, appear as great and certain as was affirmed and believed, every
mea&s;ure again&s;t her, which policy &s;hould dictate, would thence be
ju&s;tified; or if &s;he &s;hould be found innocent, every enterprize, which
friend&s;hip &s;hould in&s;pire, would be acknowledged laudable and
glorious.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE to the&s;e views, Elizabeth re&s;olved to proceed in a
&s;eemingly friend|ly, but really cautious manner, with the Queen of Scots; and
&s;he immediately &s;ent orders to lady Scrope, &s;i&s;ter to the duke of
Norfolk, a lady who lived in the neighbourhood, to attend on that prince&s;s.
Soon after &s;he di&s;patched to her the lord Scrope him&s;elf, warden of the
marches, and Sir Francis Knolles, vice cham|berlain. They found Mary already
lodged in the ca&s;tle of Carli&s;le; and after expre&s;&s;ing the Queen's
&s;ympathy with her in her late misfortunes, they told her, that her reque&s;t
of being allowed to vi&s;it their &s;overeign, and of being admitted to her
pre&s;ence, could not at pre&s;ent be complied with: Till &s;he had cleared
her&s;elf of her hu&s;band's murder, of which &s;he was &s;o &s;trongly
accu&s;ed, Eliza|beth could not without di&s;honour &s;how her any countenance,
or appear indiffe|rent to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of &s;o near a
kin&s;man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. p. 54, 66, 82, 83,
86.</NOTE>. So unexpected a check threw Mary into tears; and the nece&s;&s;ity
of her &s;ituation extorted from her a declara|tion, that &s;he would willingly
ju&s;tify her&s;elf to her &s;i&s;ter from all imputations, and would &s;ubmit
her cau&s;e to the arbitration of &s;o good a friend<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 10, 55, 87.</NOTE>. Two days after, &s;he &s;ent lord
Herreis to London with a letter to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS conce&s;&s;ion, which Mary could &s;carce avoid, without an
acknowlegement of guilt, was the point expected and de&s;ired by Elizabeth: She
immediately di&s;|patched <PB N="491" REF="94"> Midlemore to the regent of
Scotland; requiring him both to de&s;i&s;t from the farther pro&s;ecution of
his Queen's party, and to &s;end &s;ome per&s;ons to London to ju&s;tify his
conduct with regard to her. Murray might ju&s;tly be &s;tartled at receiv|ing a
me&s;&s;age, which mu&s;t have appeared &s;omewhat imperious; but as his
dome&s;tic enemies were numerous and powerful, and England was the &s;ole ally,
which he could expect among foreign nations, he was re&s;olved rather to
dige&s;t the affront than provoke Elizabeth by a refu&s;al. He al&s;o
con&s;idered, that tho' that Queen had hitherto appeared partial to Mary, her
intere&s;t evidently engaged her to &s;upport the King's cau&s;e in Scotland;
and it was not to be doubted but that pe|netrating prince&s;s would in the end
di&s;cover this advantage, and would at lea&s;t afford him a patient and
equitable hearing. He therefore replied, that he would him&s;elf take a journey
into England, attended with other commi&s;&s;ioners, and would willingly
&s;ubmit the determination of his cau&s;e to Elizabeth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LORD Herreis now perceived, that his mi&s;tre&s;s had advanced
too far in her con|ce&s;&s;ions: He endeavoured to maintain, that Mary could
not, without diminution of her royal dignity, &s;ubmit to a conte&s;t with her
rebellious &s;ubjects before a foreign prince; and he required either pre&s;ent
aid from England, or liberty for his Queen to pa&s;s over into France. Being
pre&s;&s;ed, however, with the former agreement before the Engli&s;h council,
he again renewed his con&s;ent; but in a few days he began anew to recoil, and
it was with &s;ome difficulty that he was brought to acqui|e&s;ce in the
fir&s;t determination<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
16-20.</NOTE>. The&s;e fluctuations, which were ince&s;&s;antly re|newed,
&s;howed his vi&s;ible reluctance to the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued by the court of
England.</P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots di&s;covered no le&s;s aver&s;ion to the
trial propo&s;ed; and it required all the artifice and prudence of Elizabeth to
make her per&s;evere in the agreement to which &s;he had at fir&s;t
con&s;ented. This latter prince&s;s &s;till &s;aid to her, that &s;he de&s;ired
not, without Mary's con&s;ent and approbation, to enter into this que&s;tion,
and pretended only as a friend to hear her ju&s;tification: That &s;he was
confident there would be found no difficulty in refuting all the calumnies of
her enemies; and even if her apology &s;hould fall &s;hort of full conviction,
Eliza|beth was determined to &s;upport her cau&s;e, and procure her &s;ome
rea&s;onable terms of accommodation: And that it was never meant, that &s;he
&s;hould be cited to a trial with her rebellious &s;ubjects, but on the
contrary, that they &s;hould be &s;ummoned to appear and ju&s;tify them&s;elves
for their conduct towards her<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 11,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>. Allured by the&s;e
plau&s;ible profe&s;&s;ions, the Queen of Scots agreed to ju&s;tify her&s;elf
by her own commi&s;&s;ioners before commi&s;&s;ioners which &s;hould be
appointed by Elizabeth.</P>
<P><PB N="492" REF="95"> DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions, the lord
Scrope and Sir Francis Knolles, who re|&s;ided with Mary at Carli&s;le, had
leizure to &s;tudy her character, and to make re|port of it to Elizabeth.
Unbroken by her misfortunes, re&s;olute in her purpo&s;e, active in her
enterprizes, &s;he a&s;pired to nothing but victory, and was determined to
endure any extremity, to undergo any difficulty, and to try every fortune,
rather than abandon her cau&s;e, or yield the &s;uperiority to her enemies.
Eloquent, in|&s;inuating, affable; &s;he had already convinced all tho&s;e, who
approached her, of the innocence of her pa&s;t conduct; and as &s;he declared
her fixed purpo&s;e to re|quire aid of her friends all over Europe, and even to
have recour&s;e to infidels and barbarians, rather than fail of vengeance
again&s;t her per&s;ecutors, it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee the danger to which her
charms, her &s;pirit, her addre&s;s, if allowed to operate with their full
force, would expo&s;e them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. p.
5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, 71, 72, 74, 78, 92.</NOTE>. The
court of England, therefore, who under pretence of guarding her, had already,
in effect, detained her clo&s;e pri&s;oner, were determined to watch her with
&s;till greater vigilance. As Carli&s;le, by its &s;ituation on the borders,
afforded her great opportunities for contriv|ing her e&s;cape, they removed her
to Bolton, a &s;eat of lord Scrope's in York&s;hire: And the i&s;&s;ue of the
controver&s;y between her and the Scotch nation was regarded as a &s;ubject
more momentous to Elizabeth's &s;ecurity and intere&s;ts, than it had ever
hitherto been apprehended.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conferences at York and Hampton|court.</NOTE>
THE per&s;ons, appointed by the Engli&s;h court for the examination of this
great cau&s;e, were the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Su&s;&s;ex, and Sir Ralph
Sadler; and York was named as the place of conference. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th October.</NOTE> Le&s;ley, bi&s;hop of
Ro&s;s, the lords Herreis, Leving&s;tone and Boyde, with five per&s;ons more,
appeared as commi&s;|&s;ioners from the Queen of Scots. The earl of Murray,
regent, the earl of Mor|ton, the bi&s;hop of Orkney, lord Linde&s;ey, and the
abbot of Dunfermling were appointed commi&s;&s;ioners from the King and kingdom
of Scotland. Secretary Ledington, George Buchanan, the famous poet and
hi&s;torian, with &s;ome others, were named as their a&s;&s;i&s;tants.</P>
<P>IT was a great circum&s;tance of Elizabeth's glory, that &s;he
was thus cho&s;en umpire between the factions of a neighbouring kingdom, which
had, during many centuries, entertained the mo&s;t violent jealou&s;y and
animo&s;ity again&s;t Eng|land; and her felicity was equally rare, in having
the fortune and fame of &s;o dange|rous a rival, who had long given her the
greate&s;t inquietude, now entirely at her di&s;po&s;al. Some circum&s;tances
of her late conduct had di&s;covered a bya&s;s towards the &s;ide of Mary: Her
prevailing intere&s;ts led her to favour the enemies of that prince&s;s: The
profe&s;&s;ions of impartiality, which &s;he had made, were open and 
<PB N="493" REF="96"> frequent; and &s;he had &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that each
&s;ide accu&s;ed her commi&s;&s;ioners of partiality towards their
adver&s;aries<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p.

fixed no plan for the deci&s;ion; but &s;he knew, that the ad|vantages, which
&s;he &s;hould reap, mu&s;t be great, whatever i&s;&s;ue the cau&s;e &s;hould
take. If Mary's crimes could be a&s;certained by undoubted proof, &s;he could
for ever bla&s;t the reputation of that prince&s;s, and might ju&s;tifiably
detain her for ever a clo&s;e pri&s;oner in England: If the evidence fell
&s;hort of conviction, it was propo&s;ed to re&s;tore her to her throne, but
with &s;uch &s;trict limitations, as would leave Elizabeth perpetual arbiter of
all differences between the parties in Scot|land, and render her in effect

<P>MARY'S commi&s;&s;ioners, before they gave in their complaints
again&s;t her ene|mies in Scotland, entered a prote&s;t, that their appearance
in the cau&s;e &s;hould no wi&s;e affect the independance of her crown, or be
con&s;trued as a mark of &s;ubor|dination to England: The Engli&s;h
commi&s;&s;ioners received this prote&s;t, but with a re&s;erve to the claim of
England. The complaint of that prince&s;s was next read, and contained a detail
of all the injuries, which &s;he had &s;uffered, &s;ince her marriage with
Bothwel: That her &s;ubjects had taken arms again&s;t her, under pretence of
freeing her from captivity; that when &s;he put her&s;elf into their hands,
they had committed her to clo&s;e cu&s;tody in Lochlevin; had crowned her
&s;on, an infant, in her place; had again taken arms again&s;t her after her
delivery from pri&s;on; had rejected all her propo&s;als for accommodation; had
given battle to her troops; and had obliged her, for the &s;afety of her
per&s;on, to take &s;helter in England<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 52. Goodall, vol. II. p. 128.
Haynes, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>. The earl
of Murray, in an&s;wer to this complaint, gave a &s;ummary and imperfect
account of the late tran&s;actions: That the earl of Bothwel, the known
murderer of the late King, had, a little time after the commi&s;&s;ion of that
crime, &s;eized the per&s;on of the Queen and led her to Dunbar; that he
acquired &s;uch influence over her as to gain her con&s;ent to marry him, and
he had accordingly procured a divorce from his former wife, and had pretended
to celebrate his marriage with the Queen; that the &s;candal of this
tran&s;action, the di&s;honour which it brought on the whole nation, the danger
to which the infant prince was expo&s;ed from the attempts of that audacious
man, had obliged the nobility to take arms, and oppo&s;e his criminal de&s;igns
and enterprizes; that after the Queen, in order to &s;ave him, had thrown
her&s;elf into their hands, &s;he &s;till di&s;covered &s;uch a vio|lent
attachment to him, that they found it nece&s;&s;ary, for their own and the
public &s;afety, to confine her per&s;on, during a &s;ea&s;on, till Bothwel and
the other mur|derers <PB N="494" REF="97"> of her hu&s;band could be tried and
puni&s;hed for their crimes; and that during this confinement, &s;he had
voluntarily, without compul&s;ion or violence, merely from di&s;gu&s;t at the
inquietudes and vexations attending power, re&s;igned her crown to her only
&s;on, and had appointed the earl of Murray regent during the minority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 64 &amp; &s;eq. Goodall,
vol. II. p. 144.</NOTE>. The Queen's an&s;wer to this apology was obvious: That
&s;he did not know and never could &s;u&s;pect, that Bothwel, who had been
acquitted by a jury, and recommended to her by all the nobility for her
hu&s;band, was the mur|derer of the King; that &s;he ever was, and &s;till
continues de&s;irous, that, if he be guilty, he may be brought to condign
puni&s;hment; that her re&s;ignation of the crown was extorted from her by the
well-grounded fears of her life, and even by the direct menaces of violence;
and that Throcmorton, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, as well as others of her
friends, had advi&s;ed her to &s;ign that paper as the only means of &s;aving
her&s;elf from the la&s;t extremity, and had a&s;&s;ured her, that a
con|&s;ent, given under the&s;e circum&s;tances, could never have any force or
validity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 60

<P>SO far the Queen of Scots &s;eemed plainly to have the advantage
in the con|te&s;t; and the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners might have been
&s;urprized, that Murray had made &s;o weak a defence, and had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
all the material imputations again&s;t that prince&s;s, on which his party had
ever &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted, had not &s;ome private conferences
previou&s;ly informed them of the &s;ecret. Mary's com|mi&s;&s;ioners had
boa&s;ted, that Elizabeth, from regard to her kin&s;woman, and from her
de&s;ire of maintaining the rights of &s;overeigns, was determined, however
criminal the conduct of that prince&s;s might appear, to re&s;tore her to the
throne<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 45.
Goodall, vol. II. p. 127.</NOTE>; and Murray, reflecting on &s;ome pa&s;t
mea&s;ures of the Engli&s;h court, began to apprehend that there was but too
ju&s;t grounds for their expectations. He be|lieved, that Mary, if he would
agree to conceal the mo&s;t violent part of the accu&s;ation again&s;t her,
would &s;ubmit to any rea&s;onable terms of accommodation; but if he once
proceeded &s;o far as to charge her with the whole of her &s;uppo&s;ed guilt,
no compo&s;ition could afterwards take place; and &s;hould &s;he ever be
re|&s;tored, either by the power of Elizabeth, or the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her

venture ra&s;hly on a mea&s;ure, which it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him ever
to recal; and he paid privately a vi&s;it to Norfolk and the other Engli&s;h

pronounce any &s;entence again&s;t Mary, in ca&s;e her guilt &s;hould be fully
proved before them? Whether they would promi&s;e to exerci&s;e that authority,
and proceed to an actual &s;entence? Whether the Queen of Scots, if &s;he was
found guilty, &s;hould be delivered into the hands of the regent, or, at
lea&s;t, &s;o &s;ecured in England, that &s;he never &s;hould be able to
di&s;turb the tranquillity of Scotland? and, Whether Elizabeth would al&s;o, in
that ca&s;e, promi&s;e to acknowlege the young King, and protect the regent in
his authority<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p.

<P>ELIZABETH, when the&s;e queries, with the other tran&s;actions,
were laid before her, began to think that they pointed towards a conclu&s;ion
more deci&s;ive and more advantageous than &s;he had hitherto expected. She was
determined, therefore, to bring the matter into full light; and under pretext
that the di&s;tance from her per&s;on retarded the proceedings of her
commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;he ordered them to come to London, and there continue the
conferences. On their appearance, &s;he imme|diately joined in commi&s;&s;ion
with them, &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of her council; Sir Nicholas
Bacon lord keeper, the earls of Arundel and Leice&s;ter, lord Clinton, admiral,
and Sir William Cecil, &s;ecretary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV.
part 2. p. 99.</NOTE>. The Queen of Scots, who knew nothing of the&s;e &s;ecret
motives, and who expected, that fear or decency would &s;till re&s;train Murray
from proceeding to any violent accu&s;ation again&s;t her, expre&s;&s;ed an
entire &s;atisfaction in this adjournment, and declared, that the affair, being
under the immediate in&s;pection of Elizabeth, was now in the hands where &s;he
mo&s;t de&s;ired it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 95. Goodall, vol.
II. p. 177, 179.</NOTE>. The conferences were accordingly continued at
Hampton-Court; and Mary's commi&s;&s;ioners, as before, made no &s;cruple to be
pre&s;ent at them.</P>
<P><PB N="496" REF="99"> THE Queen, meanwhile, gave a
&s;atisfactory an&s;wer to all Murray's demands; and having declared, that tho'
&s;he wi&s;hed and hoped, from the pre&s;ent enquiry, to be entirely convinced
of Mary's innocence, yet if the event &s;hould prove con|trary, and if that
prince&s;s &s;hould appear guilty of her hu&s;band's murder, &s;he &s;hould,
for her part, e&s;teem her ever after unworthy of a throne<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. II. p. 199.</NOTE>. The regent, encouraged by this
declaration, opened more fully his charge again&s;t the Queen of Scots; and
after expre&s;&s;ing his reluctance to proceed to that extremity, and
prote&s;t|ing, that nothing but the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-defence, which
mu&s;t not be abandoned for any delicacy, could have engaged him in &s;uch a
mea&s;ure, he proceeded to accu&s;e her in plain terms, of participation and
con&s;ent in the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the King<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 115, &amp; &s;eq. Goodall, vol.

commi&s;&s;ioners; and imploring vengeance for the murder of his &s;on,
accu&s;ed Mary as an accomplice with Both|wel in that enormity<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 122. Goodall, vol.
II. p. 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN this charge was &s;o unexpectedly given in, and copies of
it tran&s;mitted to the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, lord Herreis, and the re&s;t of
Mary's commi&s;&s;ioners, they ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to return any an&s;wer;
and they grounded their &s;ilence on very extraordinary rea&s;ons: They had
orders, they &s;aid, from their mi&s;tre&s;s, if any thing was advanced that
might touch her honour, not to make any defence, as &s;he was a &s;overeign
prince&s;s, and could not be &s;ubject to any tribunal; and they required, that
&s;he &s;hould previou&s;ly be admitted to Elizabeth's pre&s;ence, to whom, and
to whom alone, &s;he was determined to ju&s;tify her innocence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 125, &amp; &s;eq. Goodall,
vol. II. 184, 211, 217.</NOTE>. They forgot, that the conferences were at
fir&s;t begun, and were &s;till continued, with no other view than to clear her
from the accu&s;ations of her enemies; that Elizabeth had ever pretended to
enter into them only as her friend, by her own con&s;ent and approbation, not
as a&s;&s;uming any &s;uperior juri&s;diction over her; that that prin|ce&s;s
had from the beginning refu&s;ed to admit her to her pre&s;ence, till &s;he
&s;hould clear her&s;elf of the crimes imputed to her; that &s;he had therefore
di&s;covered no new &s;igns of partiality by her per&s;everance in that
re&s;olution; and that tho' &s;he had granted an audience to the earl of Murray
and his collegues, &s;he had previ|ou&s;ly conferred the &s;ame honour on
Mary's commi&s;&s;ioners<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley's Negociations
in Ander&s;on, vol. III. p. 25. Haynes, p. 487.</NOTE>; and her conduct was
&s;o far entirely equal to both parties.</P>
<P>AS the Queen of Scots refu&s;ed to give in any an&s;wer to
Murray's charge, the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence &s;eemed to be, that there
could be no farther proceedings in the trial. But tho' this &s;ilence might be
interpreted as a pre&s;umption again&s;t <PB N="497" REF="100"> her, it did not
fully an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of tho&s;e Engli&s;h mini&s;ters, who were the
enemies of that prince&s;s. They &s;till de&s;ired to have in their hands the
proofs of her guilt; and in order to draw them with decency from the regent, a
judicious artifice was employed by Elizabeth. Murray was called before the
Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners; and reproved by them, in the Queen's name, for the
atrocious imputations which he had had the temerity to throw upon his
&s;overeign: But tho' the earl of Murray, they added, and the other
commi&s;&s;ioners, had &s;o far forgot the duty of allegiance to their prince,
the Queen never would overlook what &s;he owed to her friend, her neighbour,
and her kin&s;woman; and &s;he therefore de&s;ired to know what they could
&s;ay in their own ju&s;tification<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on,
vol. IV. part 2. p. 147. Goodall, vol. II. p. 233.</NOTE>. Murray, thus urged,
made no difficulty of producing the proofs of his charge again&s;t the Queen of
Scots; and among the re&s;t, &s;ome love-letters and &s;onnets of her's to
Bothwel, wrote all in her own hand, and two other papers, one wrote in her own
hand, another &s;ign|ed by her, and wrote by the earl of Huntley; each of which
contained a pro|mi&s;e of marriage with Bothwel.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e important papers had been kept by Bothwel in a
&s;ilver box or ca&s;ket, which had been given him by Mary, and which had
belonged to her fir&s;t hu&s;band, Francis; and tho' the prince&s;s had
enjoined him to burn the letters as &s;oon as he had read them, he had thought
proper to pre&s;erve them carefully, as pledges of her fidelity, and had
committed them to the cu&s;tody of Sir James Balfour, go|vernor of the ca&s;tle
of Edinburgh. When that fortre&s;s was be&s;ieged by the a&s;&s;o|ciated lords,
Bothwel &s;ent a &s;ervant to receive the ca&s;ket from the hands of the
governor. Balfour delivered it to the me&s;&s;enger; but as he had at that time
received &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t from Bothwel, and was &s;ecretly negociating an
agree|ment with the ruling party, he took care, by conveying private
intelligence to the earl of Morton, to make the papers be intercepted by him.
They contained inconte&s;tible proofs of Mary's criminal corre&s;pondence with
Bothwel, of her con&s;ent to the King's murder, and of her concurrence in that
rape which Bothwel pretended to commit upon her<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol II. p. 115. Goodall, vol. II. p. 1.</NOTE>. Murray
fortified this evidence by &s;ome te&s;ti|monies of corre&s;pondent facts<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. II. part 2. p. 165, &amp;c. Goodall,
vol. II. p. 213.</NOTE>; and he added, &s;ometime after, the dying
con|fe&s;&s;ion of one Hubert, or French Paris, as he was called, a &s;ervant
of Bothwel's, who had been executed for the King's murder, and who directly
charged the Queen with her being acce&s;&s;ary to that criminal enterprize<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. II. p. 192. Goodall, vol. II. p.
76.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MARY'S commi&s;&s;ioners had u&s;ed every expedient to ward this
blow, which they &s;aw coming upon them, and again&s;t which, it appears, they
were not provided <PB N="498" REF="101"> in any proper defence. As &s;oon as
Murray opened his charge, they endeavoured to turn the conferences from an
enquiry into a negociation; and tho' informed by the Engli&s;h
commi&s;&s;ioners, that nothing could be more di&s;honourable for their
mi&s;|tre&s;s, than to enter into a treaty with &s;uch undutiful &s;ubjects,
before &s;he had ju&s;|tified her&s;elf from tho&s;e enormous imputations which
had been thrown upon her, they &s;till in&s;i&s;ted, that Elizabeth &s;hould
&s;ettle terms of accommodation between Mary and her enemies in Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. II. part 2. p. 135, 139. Goodall, vol. II. p.
224.</NOTE>. They maintained, that till their mi&s;tre&s;s had given in her
an&s;wer to Murray's charge, his proofs could neither be called for nor
produced<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 139,
145. Goodall, vol. II. p. 228.</NOTE>; and finding, that the Engli&s;h
commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;till determined to proceed in the method which had
been projected, they finally broke off the conferences, and never would make
any reply. The&s;e papers have all of them been &s;ince publi&s;hed. The
objections made to their validity, are in general of &s;mall force: But were
they ever &s;o &s;pecious, they cannot now be hearkened to; &s;ince Mary, at
the time when the truth could have been fully cleared, did, in effect, ratify
the evidence again&s;t her, by recoiling from the enquiry at the very critical
moment, and refu&s;ing to give any an&s;wer to the accu&s;ation of her
ene|mies<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>We &s;hall not enter into a long di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the
authenticity of the&s;e letters: We &s;hall only re|mark in general, that the
chief objections again&s;t them are, that they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have
pa&s;&s;ed thro' the earl of Morton's hands, the lea&s;t &s;crupulous of all
Mary's enemies; and that they are, to the la&s;t degree, indecent, and even
&s;omewhat inelegant, &s;uch as it is not likely &s;he would write. But to
the&s;e pre&s;umptions we may oppo&s;e the following con&s;iderations. (1) The'
it be not difficult to counterfeit a &s;ub&s;cription, it is very difficult,
and almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, to counterfeit &s;everal pages, &s;o as to
re|&s;emble exactly the hand writing of any per&s;on. (2.) The letters are very
long, much longer than they needed to have been, in order to &s;erve the
purpo&s;es of Mary's enemies; a circum&s;tance, which increa&s;ed the
difficulty, and expo&s;ed any forgery the more to the ri&s;k of a detection.
(3.) They are not &s;o gro&s;s and palpable, as forgeries commonly are; for
they left &s;till a pretext for Mary's friends to a&s;&s;ert, that their
meaning was &s;trained to make them appear criminal; &s;ee Goodall, vol. II. p.
361. (4.) There is a long contract of marriage, &s;aid to be wrote by the earl
of Huntley, and &s;igned by the Queen, before Bothwel's acquital. Would Morton,
without any nece&s;&s;ity, have thus doubled the dif|ficulties of the forgery,
and the danger of detection? (5.) The letters are indi&s;creet; but &s;uch was
apparently Mary's conduct at that time: They are inelegant; but they have a
carele&s;s, natural air, like letters ha&s;tily wrote between familiar friends.
(6.) They contain &s;uch a variety of particular cir|cum&s;tances, as no body
could have thought of inventing, e&s;pecially as they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
have a&s;|forded her many means of detection. (7.) We &s;ee, that in writing
the fir&s;t and longe&s;t letter, which &s;he penned late at night, her paper
failed her, and &s;he takes down a memorandum of what &s;he intended to add
next morning; and it is accordingly added: A circum&s;tance very particular,
and not likely to occur to any per&s;on who would forge the&s;e letters. (8.)
We have not the ori|ginals of the letters, which were in French: We have only a
Scotch and Latin tran&s;lation from the original, and a French tran&s;lation
profe&s;&s;edly done from the Latin. Now it is remarkable, that the Scotch
tran&s;lation is full of Gallici&s;ms, and is clearly a tran&s;lation from a
French original: Such as <HI>make fault, faire des fautes; make it &s;eem that

to make me adverti&s;en ent, faire m'avertir; put order to it, mettre ordre a

garde,</HI> &amp;c. (9.) There is a conver&s;ation, which &s;he mentions,
between her&s;elf and the King one evening: But Murray produced before the
Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, the te&s;timony of one Craw|ford, a gentleman of
the earl of Lenox, who &s;wore, that the King, on her departure from him, gave
him an account of the &s;ame conver&s;ation. (10.) There &s;eems very little
rea&s;on why Murray and his a&s;&s;ociates &s;hould run the ri&s;k of &s;uch a
dangerous forgery, which mu&s;t have rendered them infamous, if detected;
&s;ince their cau&s;e, from Mary's known conduct, even without the&s;e letters,
was &s;ufficiently good and ju&s;tifiable. (11.) Murray expo&s;ed the&s;e
letters to the examination of per&s;ons qualified to judge of them; the Scotch
council, the Scotch Parliament, Queen Elizabeth and her council, who were
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great number of Mary's genuine letters. (12.) He gave
Mary her&s;elf an oppor|tunity of refuting and expo&s;ing him, if &s;he had
cho&s;en to lay hold of it. (13.) The letters tally &s;o well with all the
other parts of her conduct during that tran&s;action, that the&s;e proofs throw
the &s;trong|e&s;t light on each other. (14.) The duke of Norfolk, who had
examined the&s;e papers, and who fa|voured &s;o much Queen Mary, that he
intended to marry her, and in the end lo&s;t his life in her cau&s;e, yet
believed them authentic, and was fully convinced of her guilt. This appears not
only from his letters above mentioned, to Queen Elizabeth and her mini&s;ters,
but by his &s;ecret acknowlegement to Bani&s;ter, his mo&s;t tru&s;ty
confident. See State Trials, vol. 1. p. 81. In the conferences between the
duke, &s;ecretary Lidington, and the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, all of them zealous
partizans of that prince&s;s, the &s;ame thing &s;eems always to be taken for
granted. Ibid. p. 74, 75. See farther MS. in the Advocate's library. A. 3. 28.
p. 314. from Cott. lib. Calig. c. 9. (15.) I need not re|peat the pre&s;umption
drawn from Mary's refu&s;al to an&s;wer. The only excu&s;e for her &s;ilence,
is, that the &s;u&s;pected Elizabeth to be a partial judge: It was not, indeed,
the intere&s;t of that prince&s;s to ac|quit and ju&s;tify her rival and
competitor; and we accordingly find that Lidington, from the &s;ecret
in|formation of the duke of Norfolk, informed Mary, by the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s,
that the Queen of Eng|land never meant to come to a deci&s;ion; but only to get
into her hands the proofs of Mary's guilt, in order to bla&s;t her character:
See State Trials, vol. 1. p. 77. But this was a better rea&s;on for declining
the trial altogether than for breaking it off, on frivolous pretences, the very
moment the chief accu&s;i|tion was unexpectedly opened again&s;t her. Tho'
&s;he could not expect Elizabeth's final deci&s;ion in her favour, it was of
importance to give a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, if &s;he had any, to the
accu&s;ation of the Scotch commi&s;&s;ioners. That an&s;wer could have been
di&s;per&s;t for the conviction of the public, of to|reign nations, and of
po&s;terity. And &s;urely after the accu&s;ation and proofs were in Queen
Elizabeth's hand, it could do no hurt to give in the an&s;wers. Mary's
information, that the Queen never in|teaded to come to a deci&s;ion, could be
no ob&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">cle to her
ju&s;tification. (16.) The very di&s;appearance of the&s;e letters, is a
pre&s;umption of their authenticity. That event can be accounted for no way but
from the care of King James's friends, who were di&s;irous to de&s;troy every
proof of his mother's crimes. The di&s;appearance of Morton's narrative, and of
Crawford's evidence, from the Cotton library, Calig. c. 1. mu&s;t have
proceeded from a like cau&s;e. See MS. in the Advocate's library, A. 3. 29. p.
88.</P> 
<P>I find an objection made to the authenticity of the letters,
drawn from the vote of the Scotch privy|council, which affirms the letters to
be wrote and &s;ub&s;cribed by Queen Mary's own hand; whereas the copies given
in to the Parliament a few days after, were only wrote, not &s;ub&s;cribed. See
Good|all, vol. II. p. 64, 67. But it is not con&s;idered, that this
circum&s;tance is of no manner of force: There were certainly letters, true or
fal&s;e, laid before the council; and whether the letters were true or fal&s;e,
this mi&s;take proceeds equally from the inaccuracy or blunder of the clerk.
The mi&s;take is ea&s;ily accounted for: The letters were only wrote by her;
the &s;econd contract with Bothwel was only &s;ub&s;cribed. A proper accurate
di&s;tinction was not made; and they are all &s;aid to be wrote and
&s;ub|&s;cribed. A late writer, Mr. Goodall, has endeavoured to prove, that
the&s;e letters cla&s;h with chrono|logy, and that the Queen was not in the
places mentioned in the letters, on the days there a&s;&s;igned: To confirm
this, he produces charters and other deeds &s;igned by the Queen, where the
date and place do not agree with the letters. But it is well known, that the
date of charters, and &s;uch like grants, is no proof of the real day in which
they were &s;igned by the &s;overeign. Papers of that kind com|monly pa&s;s
through different offices: The date is affixed by the fir&s;t office; and may
precede very long the day of the &s;ignature.</P> 
<P>The account given by Morton of the manner in which the
papers came into his hands, is very natu|ral. When he gave it to the Engli&s;h
commi&s;&s;ioners, he had rea&s;on to think it would be canva&s;&s;ed with all
the &s;everity of able adver&s;aries, intere&s;ted in the highe&s;t degree to
refute it. It is probable, that he could have confirmed it by many
circum&s;tances and te&s;timonies; &s;ince they declined the conte&s;t.</P> 
<P>The like ob&s;ervation extends to Hubert's dying
confe&s;&s;ion. It is in vain at pre&s;ent to &s;eek improba|bilities in it,
and to magnify the &s;malle&s;t difficulty into a contradiction. It was
certainly a regular ju|dicial paper, given in regularly and judicially; and
ought to have been canva&s;&s;ed at the time, if the per&s;ons whom it
concerned had been a&s;&s;ured of their own innocence.</P> 
<P>The &s;onnets are inelegant; in&s;omuch, that both Brantome
and Ron&s;ard, who knew Queen Mary's &s;tile, were a&s;&s;ured, when they &s;aw
them, that they could not be her compo&s;ition. Jebb, vol. II. p. 478. But no
per&s;on is equal in his productions, e&s;pecially one who&s;e &s;tile is &s;o
little formed as Mary's mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be. Not to mention, that
&s;uch dangerous and criminal enterprizes leave little tranquillity of mind for
elegant, poetical compo&s;itions.</P> 
<P>In a word, Queen Mary might ea&s;ily have conducted the
whole con&s;piracy again&s;t her hu&s;band, without opening her mind to any one
per&s;on except Bothwel, and without writing a &s;crap of paper about it; but
it was very difficult to have conducted it, &s;o as that her conduct &s;hould
not betray her to men of di&s;cernment. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, her conduct
was &s;o gro&s;s as to betray her to every body; and fortune threw into her
enemies hands, papers by which they could convict her. The &s;ame in&s;atuation
and imprudence, which happily is the u&s;ual attendant of great crimes, will
account for both. It is proper to ob&s;erve, that there is not one
circum&s;tance of the foregoing narrative, contained in the hi&s;tory, that is
taken from Knox, Buchanan, or even Thuanus, or, indeed, from any &s;u&s;pected
authority.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE Queen of Scots had no other &s;ubter&s;uge from the&s;e
pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances than &s;till to demand a per&s;onal conference with
Elizabeth: A conce&s;&s;ion which, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible, could never be
granted<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Cabala, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">7.</NOTE>; both becau&s;e Elizabeth
knew, that that expedient could decide nothing, and becau&s;e it brought
matters to extre|mity, which that prince&s;s wanted to avoid. In order to keep
her&s;elf better in countenance, Mary thought of another device. Even after all
the conferences were broke off, &s;he ordered her commi&s;&s;ioners to accu&s;e
the earl of Murray and his a&s;&s;ociates as the murderers of the Kind<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. II. p. 280.</NOTE>: But this
accu&s;ation, coming &s;o late, being extorted merely by a complaint to
Murray's, and being un&s;upported by any proof, could only be regarded as an
angry retaliation upon her enemy<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>Unle&s;s we take this angry accu&s;ation, advanced by Queen
Mary, to be an argument of Mur|ray's guilt, there remains not the lea&s;t
pre&s;umption which &s;hould lead us to &s;u&s;pect him to have been any way an
accomplice in the King's murder. That Queen never pretended to give any proof
of the charge; and her commi&s;&s;ioners affirmed at the time, that they
them&s;elves knew of none, tho' they were ready to maintain its truth by their
mi&s;tre&s;s's orders, and would produce &s;uch proof as &s;he &s;hould &s;end
them. It is remarkable, that, at that time, it was impo&s;&s;ible for either
her or them to pro|duce any proof; becau&s;e the conferences before the
Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners were previou&s;ly broke off.</P> 
<P>It is true, the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, in an angry pamphlet,
wrote by him under a borrowed name, (where it is ea&s;y to &s;ay any thing)
affirms, that lord Herreis, a few days after the King's death, charged Mur|ray
with the guilt, openly, to his face, at his own table. That nobleman, as
Le&s;ly relates the mat|ter, affirmed, that Murray, riding in Fife with one of
his &s;ervants, the evening before the commi&s;&s;ion of that crime, &s;aid to
him among other talk, <HI>This night' ere morning the lord Darnley &s;hall
lo&s;e his life.</HI> See Ander&s;on, vol. I. 75. But this is only hear&s;ay of
Le&s;ly's, concerning a hear&s;ay of Herreis's; and contains a very improbable
fact. Would Murray, without any u&s;e or nece&s;&s;ity, communicate to a
&s;ervant, &s;uch a dangerous and important &s;ecret, merely by way of
conver&s;ation? We may al&s;o ob|&s;erve, that lord Herreis him&s;elf was one
of Queen Mary's commi&s;&s;ioners who accu&s;ed Murray. Had he ever heard this
&s;tory, or given credit to it, was not that the time to have produced it; and
not have affirmed, as he did, that he, for his part, knew nothing of Murray's
guilt. See Goodall, vol. II. p. 307.</P> 
<P>The earls of Huntley and Argyle accu&s;e Murray of this
crime; but the rea&s;on which they a&s;&s;ign is mo&s;t ridiculous. He had
given his con&s;ent to Queen Mary's divorce from the King; therefore he was the
King's murderer. See Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 192. It is a &s;ure
argument, that the&s;e earls knew no better proof again&s;t Murray, otherwi&s;e
they would have produced it, and not have infilled on &s;o ab&s;urd a
pre&s;umption. Was not this al&s;o the time for Huntley to deny his writing
Mary's con|tract with Bothwel, if that paper had been a forgery?</P> 
<P>Murray could have no motive to commit that crime. The King,
indeed, bore him &s;ome ill-will; but the King him&s;elf was become &s;o
de&s;picable, both from his own ill-conduct and the Queen's aver|&s;ion to him,
that he could neither do good nor harm to any body. To judge by the event, in
any ca&s;e, is always ab&s;urd; but more e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent. The
King's murder, indeed, procured Murray the regency: But much more Queen Mary's
ill conduct and imprudence, which he could not po&s;&s;ibly fore&s;ee, and
which never would have happened, had &s;he been entirely innocent.</P></NOTE>.

<P>MARY &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon the alternative of two demands;
either that Eliza|beth &s;hould in a&s;&s;i&s;t her in recovering her
authority, or &s;hould give her liberty to retire into France, and make trial
of the friend&s;hip of other princes: And as &s;he a&s;&s;erted, that &s;he had
come voluntarily into England, invited by many former profe&s;&s;ions of amity,
&s;he thought that one of the&s;e reque&s;ts could not, without the mo&s;t
extreme inju&s;tice, be refu&s;ed her. But Elizabeth, &s;en&s;ible of the
dan|ger, which attended either of the&s;e propo&s;als, was &s;ecretly
re&s;olved to detain her &s;till a captive; and as her retreat into England had
been very little voluntary, her claim upon the Queen's genero&s;ity appeared
much le&s;s urgent than &s;he was willing to pretend. Nece&s;&s;ity, it was
thought, would to the prudent ju&s;tify her detention: Her pa&s;t mi&s;conduct
would apologize for it to the equitable: And tho' it was fore&s;een, that
compa&s;&s;ion for her &s;ituation, joined to her intrigues and in&s;inuating
behaviour, would, while &s;he remained in England, excite the zeal of her
friends, e&s;pecially of the catholics; the&s;e inconveniencies were e&s;teemed
much le&s;s than tho&s;e which attended any other expedient. Elizabeth
tru&s;ted al&s;o to her own addre&s;s, for eluding all tho&s;e difficulties:
She propo&s;ed to avoid breaking ab|&s;olutely with the Queen of Scots, to keep
her always in hopes of accomoda|tion, to negotiate perpetually with her, and
&s;till to throw the blame of not com|ing to any conclu&s;ion, either on
unfore&s;een accidents, or on the ob&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s of
others.</P>
<P><PB N="504" REF="107"> WE come now to mention &s;ome Engli&s;h
affairs, which we left behind us, that we might not interrupt our narration of
the events in Scotland, which form &s;o material a part of the pre&s;ent reign.
The term, fixed by the treaty of Cateau-Cambre&s;is for the re&s;titution of
Calais expired in 1567; and Elizabeth, after making her demand at the gates of
that city, &s;ent Sir Thomas Smith to Paris; and that mini&s;ter, in
conjunction with Sir Henry Norris, her ordinary amba&s;&s;a|dor, enforced her
preten&s;ions. Conferences were held on that head, without coming to any
conclu&s;ion. The chancellor De L'Hopital told the Engli&s;h am|ba&s;&s;adors,
that tho' France by an article of the treaty was obliged to re&s;tore Ca|lais
on the expiration of eight years, there was another article of the &s;ame
treaty, which now deprived Elizabeth of all right, that could accrue to her by
that en|gagement: That it was agreed, if the Engli&s;h &s;hould, during that
interval, com|mit ho&s;tilities upon France, they &s;hould in&s;tantly forfeit
all claim to Calais; and the taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Havre and Dieppe,
with whatever pretences that mea&s;ure might be covered, was a plain violation
of the peace between the nations: That tho' the&s;e places were not taken by
force, but put into Elizabeth's hands by the governors; the&s;e governors were
rebels; and a corre&s;pondence with &s;uch offenders was the mo&s;t flagrant
injury, which could be committed to any &s;ove|reign: That in the treaty, which
en&s;ued upon the expul&s;ion of the Engli&s;h from Normandy, the French
mini&s;ters had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to make any mention of Calais, and had
thereby declared their intention to take advantage of the title which had
accrued to the crown of France: And that tho' a general clau&s;e had been
in&s;erted, implying a re&s;ervation of all claims; this conce&s;&s;ion could
not avail the Engli&s;h, who at that time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no ju&s;t claim to
Calais, and had previou&s;ly forfeited all preten&s;ions to that
fortre&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 587.</NOTE>. The Queen was no

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the puritans.</NOTE> OF all the
European churches, which &s;hook off the yoke of the papal autho|rity, no one
proceeded with &s;o much rea&s;on and moderation as the church of England; an
advantage, which had been derived partly from the interpo&s;ition of the civil
magi&s;trate in this innovation, partly from the gradual and &s;low &s;teps by
which the reformation was conducted in that kingdom. Rage and animo&s;ity
again&s;t the catholic religion was as little indulged as could be &s;uppo&s;ed
in &s;uch a revolution: The fabric of the &s;ecular hierarchy was maintained
entire: The antient liturgy was pre&s;erved, &s;o far as was thought
con&s;i&s;tent with the new principles: Many ceremonies, become venerable from
age and preceding u&s;e, were retained: The &s;plendor of the catholic
wor&s;hip, tho' removed, had at lea&s;t given place to order and decency: The
di&s;tinctive habits of the clergy, according to their dif|ferent ranks, were
continued: No innovation was admitted merely from &s;pite and oppo&s;ition to
the former u&s;age: And the new religion, by mitigating the genius of the
antient &s;uper&s;tition, and rendering it more compatible with the peace and
intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, had pre&s;erved it&s;elf in that happy medium, which
wi&s;e men have always &s;ought, and which the people have &s;o &s;eldom been
able to main|tain.</P>
<P>BUT tho' &s;uch in general was the &s;pirit of the reformation
in that country, many of the Engli&s;h reformers, being men of a more warm
complexion and more ob&s;tinate temper, endeavoured to pu&s;h matters to
extremity again&s;t the church of Rome, and indulged them&s;elves in the mo&s;t
violent contrariety and antipathy to all former practices. Among the&s;e,
Hooper, who afterwards &s;uffered for his religion with &s;uch extraord nary
con&s;tancy, was chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed. This man was named, during the
reign of Edward, to the fee of Gloce&s;ter, and had no <PB N="506" REF="109">
&s;cruple to accept of the epi&s;copal office; but he refu&s;ed to be
con&s;ecrated in the epi&s;copal habits, the cymarre and rochette, which had
formerly, he &s;aid, been abu&s;ed to &s;uper&s;tition, and which were thereby
rendered unbecoming a true chri&s;|tian. Cranmer and Ridley were &s;urprized at
this objection, which oppo&s;ed the received practice, and even the
e&s;tabli&s;hed laws; and tho' young Edward, de&s;irous to promote a man &s;o
celebrated for his eloquence, his zeal, and his morals, en|joined them to
di&s;pen&s;e with this ceremony, they &s;till continued re&s;olute to retain
it. Hooper then embraced the re&s;olution, rather to refu&s;e the bi&s;hopric
than cloath him&s;elf in tho&s;e hated garments; but it was determined, that,
for the &s;ake of the example, he &s;hould not e&s;cape &s;o ea&s;ily. He was
fir&s;t confined to Cran|mer's hou&s;e, and then thrown into pri&s;on, till he
&s;hould con&s;ent to be a bi&s;hop on the terms propo&s;ed: He was plyed with
conferences, and reprimands, and argu|ments: Bucer and Peter Martyr and the
mo&s;t celebrated foreign reformers were con&s;ulted on this important
que&s;tion: And a compromi&s;e, with great difficulty, was at la&s;t made, that
Hooper &s;hould not be obliged to wear commonly the ob|noxious robes, but
&s;hould agree to be con&s;ecrated in them, and to u&s;e them during cathedral
&s;ervice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 152. Heylin, p.
90.</NOTE>: A conde&s;cen&s;ion not a little extraordinary in a man of &s;o
inflexible a &s;pirit as this reformer.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame objection, which had ari&s;en with regard to the
epi&s;copal habits, had been moved again&s;t the rayment of the inferior
clergy; and the &s;urplice in par|ticular, with the tippet and corner cap, was
a great object of abhorrence to many of the popular zealots<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 416.</NOTE>. In vain was it urged, that
particular habits, as well as po&s;tures and ceremonies, being con&s;tantly
u&s;ed by the clergy, and employed in religious &s;ervice, acquire a veneration
in the eyes of the people, appear &s;acred to their apprehen&s;ions, excite
their devotion, and contract a kind of my&s;terious virtue, which attaches the
affections of men to the national and e&s;tabli&s;hed wor|&s;hip: That in order
to produce this effect an uniformity in the&s;e particulars is re|qui&s;ite,
and even a per&s;everance, as far as po&s;&s;ible, in the former practice: And
that the nation would be happy, if, by retaining the&s;e inoffen&s;ive
ob&s;ervances, they could engage the people to renounce willingly what was
hurtful or perni|cious in the antient &s;uper&s;tition. The&s;e arguments,
which had influence with wi&s;e men, were the very rea&s;ons, which engaged the
violent prote&s;tants to re|ject the habits. They pu&s;hed matters to a total
oppo&s;ition with the church of Rome: Every compliance, they &s;aid, was a
&s;ymbolizing with Antichri&s;t<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
416.</NOTE>: And this &s;pirit was carried &s;o far by &s;ome reformers, that
in a national remon&s;trance, which was afterwards made by the church of
Scotland again&s;t the&s;e habits, it was a&s;ked, 
<Q REND="inline">"What has Chri&s;t Je&s;us to do with Belial?
What has darkne&s;s <PB N="507" REF="110"> to do with light? If &s;urplices,
corner caps, and tippets have been badges of idolaters in the very act of their
idolatry; why &s;hould the preacher of Chri&s;tian liberty, and the open
rebuker of all &s;uper&s;tition partake with the dregs of the Romi&s;h bea&s;t?

rejected by the Engli&s;h church.</P>
<P>THERE was only one in&s;tance, where the &s;pirit of
contradiction to the Ro|mani&s;ts took place univer&s;ally in England: The
altar was removed from the wall, was placed in the middle of the church, and
was thenceforth denominated the communion-table. The rea&s;on, why this
reformation met with &s;uch general compliance, was, that the nobility and
gentry got thereby a pretence for making &s;poil of the plate, ve&s;tures, and
rich ornaments, which belonged to the altars<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heylin, preface, p. 3. Hi&s;t. p. 106.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE di&s;putes, which had been &s;tarted during the reign of
Edward, were carried abroad by the prote&s;tants, who fled from the
per&s;ecutions of Mary; and as their zeal had received an encrea&s;e from the
furious cruelty of their enemies, they were generally inclined to carry their
oppo&s;ition to the utmo&s;t extremity again&s;t the practices of the church of
Rome. Their communication with Calvin and the other reformers, who followed the
di&s;cipline and wor&s;hip of Geneva, confirmed them farther in this
ob&s;tinate reluctance; and tho' &s;ome of the refu|gees, particularly tho&s;e
e&s;tabli&s;hed at Frankfort, &s;till adhered to King Edward's liturgy, the
prevailing &s;pirit carried the&s;e confe&s;&s;ors to &s;eek a &s;till farther
re|formation. On the acce&s;&s;ion of Elizabeth, they returned to their native
coun|try; and being regarded with general veneration on account of their zeal
and pa&s;t &s;ufferings, they ventured to in&s;i&s;t on the e&s;tabli&s;hment
of their projected mo|del; nor did they want countenance from many of the
con&s;iderable per&s;ons in the Queen's council. But the Prince&s;s her&s;elf,
&s;o far from being willing to de|&s;poil religion of the few ornaments and
ceremonies, which remained in it, was of her&s;elf rather inclined to bring the
public wor&s;hip &s;till nearer to the Romi&s;h ritual<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>When Nowel, one of her chaplains, had &s;poke le&s;s

u&s;ually &s;aid, that &s;he thought two or three preachers were &s;ufficient

gone too far in &s;hak|ing <PB N="508" REF="111"> off tho&s;e forms and
ob&s;ervances, which, without di&s;tracting men of more refined
apprehen&s;ions, tend in a very innocent manner to allure, and amu&s;e, and
engage the vulgar. She took care to have a law for uniformity &s;trictly
enacted: She was empowered by the parliament to add any new ceremonies, which
&s;he thought proper: And tho' &s;he was &s;paring in the exerci&s;e of this
prerogative, &s;he con|tinued rigid in exacting an ob&s;ervance of the
e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, and in puni&s;hing all nonconformity. The zealots,
therefore, who harboured a &s;ecret antipathy to the epi&s;copal order and to
the whole liturgy, were obliged, in a great mea&s;ure, to conceal the&s;e
&s;entiments, which would have been regarded as highly audacious and criminal;
and they confined their avowed objections to the &s;urplice, the con|firmation
of children, the &s;ign of the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m, the ring in marriage,
kneeling at the &s;acrament, and bowing at the name of Je&s;us. So fruitle&s;s
is it for &s;overeigns to watch with a rigid care over orthodoxy, and employ
the &s;word in religious controver&s;y, that the work, perpetually renewed, is
perpetually to begin; and a garb, a ge&s;ture, nay, a metaphy&s;ical or
grammatical di&s;tinction, when rendered important by the di&s;putes of
theologians and the zeal of the ma|gi&s;trate, is &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the
unity of the church and even the peace of &s;o|ciety. The&s;e controver&s;ies
had already excited &s;uch ferment among the people, that in &s;ome places they
refu&s;ed to frequent the churches where the habits and ceremonies were u&s;ed,
would not &s;alute the conforming clergy, and proceeded &s;o far as to revile
them in the &s;treets, to &s;pit in their faces, and to u&s;e them with all
manner of contumely<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Whitgift,

&s;uper&s;tition, or beggarly elements, and which &s;eem to re&s;train the
liberal effu&s;ions of their zeal and devotion: But there was another &s;et of
opinions adopted by the&s;e innovators, which rendered them in a peculiar
manner the object of Elizabeth's aver&s;ion. The &s;ame bold and daring
&s;pirit, which accompanied them in their addre&s;&s;es to the divinity,
appear|ed in their political &s;peculations; and the principles of civil
liberty, which, during &s;ome reigns had been very little avowed in the nation,
and which were totally incompatible with the pre&s;ent exorbitant prerogative,
had been &s;trongly adopted by this new &s;ect. Scarce any &s;overeign before
Elizabeth, and none after <PB N="509" REF="112"> her, carried higher, both in
&s;peculation and practice, the authority of the crown; and the puritans (&s;o
the&s;e &s;ectaries were called, on account of their pretending to a greater
purity of wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline) could not recommend them&s;elves wor&s;e
to her favour, than by preaching up the doctrine of re&s;i&s;ting or
re&s;training princes. From all the&s;e motives, the Queen neglected no
opportunity of depre&s;|&s;ing tho&s;e zealous innovators; and while they were
countenanced by &s;ome of her mo&s;t favoured mini&s;ters, Cecil, Leice&s;ter,
Knolles, Bedford, Wal&s;ingham, &s;he never was, to the end of her life,
reconciled to their principles and practices.</P>
<P>WE have thought proper to in&s;ert in this place an account of
the ri&s;e and the genius of the puritans; becau&s;e Camden marks the pre&s;ent
year, as the period when they began to make them&s;elves mo&s;t con&s;iderable
in England. We now return to our narration.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1569" UNIT="year"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of Nor|folk's con&s;pi|racy.</NOTE> THE
Duke of Norfolk was the only peer, who enjoyed the highe&s;t title of
no|bility; and as there were at pre&s;ent no princes of the blood, the
&s;plendor of his family, the opulence of his fortune, and the extent of his
influence, had rendered him without compari&s;on the fir&s;t &s;ubject in
England. The qualities of his mind corre&s;ponded to his high &s;tation:
Beneficent, affable, generous, he had acquired the affections of the people;
prudent, moderate, ob&s;equious, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with|out jealou&s;y the
good graces of his &s;overeign. His grandfather and father had long been
regarded as the leaders of the catholics; and this hereditary attach|ment,
joined to the alliances of blood, had procured him the friend&s;hip of the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable men of that party: But as he had been educated among the
refor|mers, was &s;incerely devoted to their principles, and maintained that
&s;trict decorum and regularity of life, by which the prote&s;tants were at
that time di&s;tingui&s;hed; he thereby enjoyed the rare felicity of being
popular even with the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite factions. The height of his
pro&s;perity alone was the &s;ource of his misfortunes, and engaged him into
attempts, from which his virtue and prudence would na|turally have for ever
kept him at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>NORFOLK was at this time a widower; and being of a &s;uitable
age to e&s;pou&s;e the Queen of Scots, that marriage had appeared &s;o natural,
that it had occurred to &s;everal of his friends and tho&s;e of that
prince&s;s: But the fir&s;t per&s;on, who, after &s;ecretary Lidington, opened
the &s;cheme to the duke is &s;aid to be the earl of Mur|ray, before his
departure for Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 36, 37.</NOTE>.
That nobleman &s;et before Norfolk both the advantage of compo&s;ing the
differences in Scotland by an alliance which would be &s;o generally
acceptable, and the pro&s;pect of reaping the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of England; and
in order to bind Norfolk's intere&s;t the fa&s;ter with Mary's, he propo&s;ed
that the <PB N="510" REF="113"> duke's daughter &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the young
king of Scotland. The obtaining pre|viou&s;ly Elizabeth's con&s;ent, was
regarded both by Murray and Norfolk as a cir|cum&s;tance e&s;&s;ential to the
&s;ucce&s;s of their project; and all circum&s;tances being adju&s;ted between
them, Murray took care, by the means of Sir Robert Melvil, to have the de&s;ign
communicated to the Queen of Scots. That prince&s;s replied, that the
vexations, which &s;he had met with in her two la&s;t marriages, had made her
more inclined to lead a &s;ingle life; but &s;he was determined to &s;acrifice
her own inclinations to the public welfare: And therefore, &s;o &s;oon as &s;he
&s;hould be legally divorced from Bothwel, &s;he would be determined by the
opinion of her nobility and people in the choice of another hu&s;band<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 40, 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is probable, that Murray was not &s;incere in this
propo&s;al. He had two motives to engage him to di&s;&s;imulation. He knew the
danger, which he mu&s;t run in his return thro' the North of England, from the
power of the Earls of Northumberland and We&s;tmoreland, Mary's partizans in
that country; and he dreaded an in&s;urrection in Scotland from the duke of
Chatelrault; and the earls of Argyle and Huntley, whom &s;he had appointed her
lieutenants during her ab|&s;ence. By the&s;e feigned appearances of
friend&s;hip, he both engaged Norfolk to write in his favour to the northern
noblemen<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">State Trials, p. 76, 78.</NOTE>; and he
per&s;waded the Queen of Scots to give her lieutenants permi&s;&s;ion, and even
advice, to make a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities with the regent's party<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Norfolk, tho' he had agreed, that Elizabeth's
con&s;ent &s;hould be previou&s;ly obtained, before the completion of his
marriage, had good rea&s;on to apprehend, that he never would prevail with her
voluntarily to make that con|ce&s;&s;ion. He knew her perpetual and unrelenting
jealou&s;y again&s;t her heir and rival; he was acquainted with her former
reluctance to all propo&s;als of marriage with the Queen of Scots; he
fore&s;aw, that that prince&s;s's e&s;pou&s;ing a per&s;on of his power, and
character, and intere&s;t, would give the greate&s;t umbrage; and as it would
then become nece&s;&s;ary to re-in&s;tate Mary in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her
throne on &s;ome tole|rable terms, and even endeavour to re-e&s;tabli&s;h her
character, he dreaded, that Elizabeth, who&s;e politics had now taken a
different turn, would never agree to &s;uch indulgent and generous conditions.
He therefore endeavoured previou&s;ly to gain the con&s;ent and approbation of
&s;everal of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable nobility; and he was &s;ucce&s;sful with
the earls of Pembroke, Arundel, Derby, Bedford, Shrew&s;bury, Southampton,
Northumberland, We&s;tmoreland, Su&s;&s;ex<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 55. Camden, p. 419. Spot&s;wood, p. 230.</NOTE>. The
lord Lumley, and Sir Nicholas Throcmorton embraced cordially the propo&s;al:
Even the earl of Leice&s;ter, Elizabeth's declared favourite, who had forme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly en|tertained <PB N="511" REF="114">
&s;ome views of e&s;pou&s;ing Mary, willingly re&s;igned all his preten&s;ions,
and &s;eemed to enter zealou&s;ly into Norfolk's intere&s;ts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 535.</NOTE>. There were other mo|tives, be&s;ides
affection to the duke, which produced this general combination of the
nobility.</P>
<P>SIR William Cecil, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, was the mo&s;t
vigilant, active, and pru|dent mini&s;ter ever known in England; and as he was
governed by no views but the intere&s;ts of his &s;overeign, which he
inflexibly pur&s;ued, his authority over her became every day more predominant.
Ever cool him&s;elf, and uninfluenced by prejudice or affection, he checked
tho&s;e &s;allies of pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;ometimes of caprice, to which &s;he
was &s;ubject; and if he failed of per&s;wading her in the fir&s;t movement,
his per&s;everance, and remon&s;trances, and arguments were &s;ure at la&s;t to
recommend them&s;elves to her &s;ound di&s;cernment. The more credit he gained
with his mi&s;tre&s;s, the more was he expo&s;ed to the envy of her other
coun|&s;ellors; and as he had been &s;uppo&s;ed to adopt the intere&s;ts of the
hou&s;e of Suf|folk, who&s;e claim &s;eemed to carry with it no danger to the
pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, his enemies, in oppo&s;ition to him, were
naturally led to attach them&s;elves to the Queen of Scots. Elizabeth &s;aw,
without unea&s;ine&s;s, this emulation among her courtiers, which &s;erved to
augment her authority; and tho' &s;he &s;upported Cecil, wherever matters came
to extremity, and di&s;&s;ipated every con&s;piracy again&s;t him, particularly
one laid about this time to have him thrown into the Tower under &s;ome
pretence or other<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 417.</NOTE>, &s;he
never gave him &s;uch unlimited confidence as might enable him entirely to
cru&s;h his adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>NORFOLK, &s;en&s;ible of the difficulty, which he mu&s;t meet
with in controling Cecil's councils, e&s;pecially where they concurred with the
inclinations, as well as intere&s;ts of the Queen, dur&s;t not open to her his
intentions of marrying the Queen of Scots; but proceeded &s;till in the &s;ame
cour&s;e of encrea&s;ing his intere&s;t in the kingdom, and engaging more of
the nobility to take part in his mea&s;ures. A letter was wrote to Mary by
Leice&s;ter, and &s;igned by &s;everal men of the fir&s;t rank, recommending
Norfolk for her hu&s;band, and &s;tipulating conditions for the advantage of
both kingdoms: That &s;he &s;hould give &s;ufficient &s;urety to Elizabeth, and
the heirs of her body, for the free enjoyment of the crown of England; that a
perpetual league, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, be made between their realms and
&s;ubjects; that the prote&s;tant religion be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law in
Scotland; and that &s;he &s;hould grant an amne&s;ty to her rebels in that
kingdom<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 50. Camden, p. 420. Haynes,
p. 535, 539.</NOTE>. When Mary re|turned a favourable an&s;wer to this
application, Norfolk applied him&s;elf with new ardor to the execution of his
project; and be&s;ides &s;ecuring the intere&s;ts of many <PB N="512" REF="115"> of the con&s;iderable gentry and nobility who re&s;ided at court, he
wrote letters to &s;uch as lived at their country &s;eats, and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t authority in the &s;eve|ral counties<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ly, p. 62.</NOTE>. The Kings of France and
Spain, who intere&s;ted them&s;elves ex|tremely in Mary's cau&s;e, were
&s;ecretly con&s;ulted, and expre&s;&s;ed their approbation of the&s;e
mea&s;ures<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 63.</NOTE>. And tho'
Elizabeth's con&s;ent was always &s;uppo&s;ed as a previous condition to the
fini&s;hing this alliance, it was apparently Norfolk's in|tention, when he
proceeded &s;uch lengths without con&s;ulting her, to render his party &s;o
&s;trong, that it &s;hould no longer be in her power to refu&s;e it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;o exten&s;ive a con&s;piracy
could entirely e&s;cape the Queen's vigilance and that of Cecil. She dropt
&s;everal &s;urmi&s;es to the duke, by which he might learn, that &s;he was
acquainted with his de&s;igns; and &s;he fre|quently warned him to beware on
what pillow he repo&s;ed his head<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.
420. Spot&s;wood, p. 231.</NOTE>: But he never had the prudence or the courage
to open to her his full intentions. The fir&s;t certain intelligence, which
&s;he received of this dangerous combination was from the earl of Murray<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ly, p. 71. It appears by Haynes, p. 521, 525, that Queen
Eliza|beth had heard rumours of Norfolk's dealing with Murray&punc; and charged
the latter to inform her of the whole truth, which he accordingly did. See
al&s;o the earl of Murray's letter produced on Nor|folk's trial.</NOTE>, who,
if ever he was &s;incere in promoting Norfolk's marriage, which is much to be
&s;u&s;pected, had at lea&s;t propo&s;ed, for his own &s;afety and that of his
party, that Elizabeth &s;hould, in reality as well as in appearance, be entire
arbiter of the conditions, and &s;hould not have her con&s;ent extorted by any
confederacy of her own &s;ubjects. This information gave great alarm to the
court of England; and the more &s;o, that tho&s;e intrigues were attended with
other circum&s;tances, of which, it is probable, Elizabeth was not wholly
igno|rant.</P>
<P>AMONG the nobility and gentry, that &s;eemed to enter into
Norfolk's views, there were many, who were zealou&s;ly attached to the catholic
religion, who had no other de&s;ign than that of re&s;toring Mary to her
liberty, and who would gladly, by a combination with foreign powers, or even at
the expence of a civil war, have placed her on the throne of England. The earls
of Northumberland and We&s;tmoreland, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great power in the
north, were leaders of this party; and the former nobleman made offer to the
Queen of Scots, by Leonard Dacres, brother to lord Dacres, that he would free
her from con|finement, and convey her to Scotland or any other place, to which
&s;he &s;hould think proper to retire<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ly,
p. 76.</NOTE>. Sir Thomas and Sir Edward Stanley, &s;ons to the earl of Derby,
Sir Thomas Gerard, Rol&s;tone, and other gentlemen, who&s;e intere&s;t 
<PB N="513" REF="116"> lay in the neighbourhood of the place where Mary
re&s;ided, concurred in the &s;ame views, and required, that, in order to
facilitate the execution of the &s;cheme, a diver&s;ion &s;hould, in the mean
time, be made from the &s;ide of Flanders<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ly, p. 98.</NOTE>. Nor|folk di&s;couraged, and even in
appearance &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the&s;e con&s;piracies; both becau&s;e his duty to
Elizabeth would not allow him to think of effecting his pur|po&s;e by
rebellion, and becau&s;e he fore&s;aw, that, if the Queen of Scots came into
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e men, they would rather choo&s;e for her
hu&s;band the King of Spain, or &s;ome foreign prince, who had power, as well
as inclination, to re|e&s;tabli&s;h the catholic religion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN men of honour and good principles, like the duke of
Norfolk, engage in dangerous enterprizes, they are commonly &s;o unfortunate as
to be criminal by halves; and while they ballance between the execution of
their de&s;igns and their remor&s;es, their fear of puni&s;hment and their hope
of pardon, they render them&s;elves an ea&s;y prey to their enemies. The duke,
in order to repre&s;s the &s;ur|mizes, &s;pread again&s;t him, &s;poke
contemptuou&s;ly to Elizabeth of the Scotch alliance; affirmed that his
e&s;tate in England was more valuable than the revenue of a kingdom wa&s;ted by
civil wars and factions; and declared, that, when he amu&s;ed him&s;elf in his
own tennis-court at Norwich amid&s;t his friends and va&s;&s;als, he e&s;teemed
him&s;elf at lea&s;t a petty prince, and was fully contented with his
condition<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 420.</NOTE>. Finding, that
he did not convince her by the&s;e a&s;&s;everations, and that he was looked on

precipitated the ri&s;ing before they were fully prepared; and Northumber|land
remained in &s;u&s;pence between oppo&s;ite dangers, when he was informed, that

fled into Scotland. Northumberland was found &s;kulking in that country, and

that prin|ce&s;s to enjoy her liberty, and to &s;eek relief in all the catholic
courts of Europe, it behoved the Queen to &s;upport the mea&s;ure which &s;he
had adopted, and to guard by every prudent expedient again&s;t the mi&s;chiefs
to which it was expo&s;ed. She &s;till flattered Mary with hopes of her
protection, maintained an ambiguous con|duct between that Queen and her enemies
in Scotland, negotiated perpetually concerning the terms of her re&s;toration,
made con&s;tant profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip to her; and by the&s;e
artifices endeavoured both to prevent her from making any de&s;perate efforts
for her delivery, and to &s;atisfy the French and Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;a|dors,
who never intermitted their &s;ollicitations, &s;ometimes accompanied with
menaces, in her favour. This deceit was received with the &s;ame deceit by the
Queen of Scots: Profe&s;&s;ions of confidence were returned by profe&s;&s;ions
equally in&s;incere: And while an appearance of friend&s;hip was maintained on
both &s;ides, the animo&s;ity and jealou&s;y, which had long prevailed between
them, was every day becoming more inveterate and incurable. The&s;e two
prince&s;&s;es, in addre&s;s, capacity, activity, and &s;pirit, were nearly a
match for each other; but unhap|pily, Mary, be&s;ides her pre&s;ent forlorn
condition, was always inferior in per&s;onal conduct and di&s;cretion, as well
as in power, to her illu&s;trious rival.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH and Mary wrote at the &s;ame time letters to the
regent. The Queen of Scots de&s;ired, that her marriage with Bothwel might be
examined, and a divorce legally pronounced between them. The Queen of England
gave Murray the choice of three conditions; that Mary &s;hould be re&s;tored to
her dignity on certain terms; that &s;he &s;hould be a&s;&s;ociated with her
&s;on, and the ad|mini&s;tration remain in the regent's hands, till the young
prince &s;hould come to years of di&s;cretion; or that &s;he &s;hould be
allowed to live at liberty as a private per&s;on in Scotland, and have an
honourable &s;ettlement made upon her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MSS. in the
advocate's library. A. 3. 29. p 137. from Cott. Li b. al. c. 1&punc;</NOTE>.
Murray &s;ummoned a convention, in order to deliberate on the&s;e propo&s;als
of the two Queens. No an&s;wer was made by them to Mary's letter, under
pretence that &s;he had there maintained the &s;tyle of a &s;overeign,
addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to her &s;ubjects; but in reality, becau&s;e they
&s;aw that her reque&s;t was calculated to prepare the way for a marriage with
Norfolk, or &s;ome powerful prince, who could &s;upport her cau&s;e, and
re&s;tore her to the throne. They replied to Elizabeth, that the two former
conditions were &s;o derogatory to the royal authority of their prince, that
they could not &s;o much as deliberate concerning them: The third alone 
<PB N="517" REF="120"> could be the &s;ubject of treaty. It was evident, that
Elizabeth, in propo&s;ing conditions &s;o unequal in their importance, invited
the Scotch to a refu&s;al of tho&s;e which were mo&s;t advantageous to Mary;
and as it was difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to adju&s;t all the terms of
the third, &s;o as to render it &s;ecure and eligible to all par|ties, it was
concluded that &s;he was not &s;incere in any of them<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 230, 231. Le&s;ly, p 71.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1570" UNIT="year"> IT is pretended, that Murray

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the earl of

regent, who was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, in revenge of a private injury, by a
gentleman of the name of Hamilton. Murray was a per&s;on of con&s;iderable
vigour, ability, and con&s;tancy; but tho' he was not un&s;ucce&s;sful, during
his regency, in com|po&s;ing the di&s;&s;entions in Scotland, his talents
&s;hone out more eminently in the beginning than in the end of his life. His
manners were rough and au&s;tere; and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not that perfect
integrity, which frequently accompanies, and can alone atone for, that
unamiable character.</P>
<P>BY the death of the regent, Scotland relap&s;ed into its former
anarchy. Mary's party a&s;&s;embled together, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters
of Edinburgh. The ca&s;tle, commanded by Kirkaldy of Grange, &s;eemed to favour
her cau&s;e; and as many of the principal nobility had embraced that &s;ide, it
became probable, tho' the people were in general aver&s;e to her, that her
authority might again acquire the a&s;cendant. To check its progre&s;s,
Elizabeth di&s;patched Su&s;&s;ex, with an ar|my, to the North, under colour of
cha&s;tizing the ravages committed by the borderers. He entered Scotland, and
laid wa&s;te the lands of the Kers and Scots, &s;eized the ca&s;tle of Hume,
and committed ho&s;tilities on all Mary's partizans, who, he &s;aid, had
offended his mi&s;tre&s;s, by harbouring the Engli&s;h rebels. Sir William
Drury was afterwards &s;ent with a body of troops, and he threw down the
hou&s;es of the Hamiltons, who were engaged in the &s;ame faction. The
Eng|li&s;h armies were afterwards recalled by agreement with the Queen of
Scots, who promi&s;ed, that no French troops &s;hould be introduced into
Scotland, and that the Engli&s;h rebels &s;hould, by her partizans, be
delivered up to the Queen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ly, p. 91.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the Queen, covering her&s;elf with the pretence of
revenging her own quarrel, &s;o far contributed to &s;upport the party of the
young King, &s;he was cautious not to declare openly again&s;t the Queen of
Scots; and &s;h even &s;ent a <PB N="518" REF="121"> reque&s;t, which was equal
to a command, to the enemies of that prince&s;s, not to elect, during &s;ome
time, a regent in the place of Murray<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 240.</NOTE>. Lenox, the King's grandfather, was,
therefore, cho&s;en temporary governor, under the title of Lieutenant. Hearing
afterwards, that Mary's partizans, in&s;tead of deliver|ing up We&s;tmoreland,
and the other fugitives, as they had promi&s;ed, had allow|ed them to e&s;cape
into Flanders; &s;he permitted the King's party to give Le|nox the title of
regent<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 241.</NOTE>, and &s;he &s;ent
Randolf, as her re&s;ident, to maintain a corre&s;pondence with him. But
notwith&s;tanding this &s;lep, taken in favour of Mary's enemies, &s;he never
laid a&s;ide her ambiguous conduct, or quitted the pre|ten&s;ions of amity to
that prince&s;s. Being importuned by the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, and her other
agents, as well as by foreign amba&s;&s;adors, &s;he twice procured a
&s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms between the Scotch factions, and by that means
&s;topped the hands of the regent, who was likely to obtain advantages over the
oppo&s;ite par|ty<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 243.</NOTE>. By
the&s;e &s;eeming contrarieties &s;he kept alive the factions in Scotland,

to conquer the kingdom, and con&s;equently no intere&s;t nor de&s;ign to
in&s;tigate the parties again&s;t each other; but this con&s;equence was an
accidental effect of her cautious politics, by which &s;he was engaged, as far

other authorities, and is, indeed, contrary to her po&s;terior conduct, as well
as her intere&s;ts, and the nece&s;&s;ity of her &s;itua|tion. It was plainly
her intere&s;t, that the King's party &s;hould prevail, and nothing could have
engaged her to &s;top their progre&s;s, or even forbear from openly

<P>THE better to amu&s;e Mary with the pro&s;pect of an
accommodation, Cecil and Sir Walter Mildway were &s;ent to her, with
propo&s;als from Elizabeth. The terms were &s;omewhat rigorous, &s;uch as a
captive Queen might expect from a jealous rival; and they thereby bore the
greater appearance of &s;incerity on the part of the Engli&s;h court. It was
required, that the Queen of Scots, be&s;ides renouncing all title to the crown
of England during the life-time of Elizabeth, &s;hould make a perpetual league,
offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, between the kingdoms; that &s;he &s;hould marry no
Engli&s;hman without Elizabeth's con&s;ent, nor any other per&s;on without the
con&s;ent of the &s;tates of Scotland; that redre&s;s &s;hould be made

to contribute her endeavours towards the re&s;toration of the de|po&s;ed Queen.
The nece&s;&s;ity of Mary's affairs obliged her to con&s;ent to them; and the
Kings of France and Spain, as well as the pope, when con&s;ulted by her,
approved of her conduct; chiefly on account of the civil wars by which all
Eu|rope was at that time agitated, and which incapacitated the catholic princes
from giving her any a&s;&s;i&s;tance<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ly, p.

<P>ELIZABETH'S commi&s;&s;ioners propo&s;ed al&s;o to Mary a plan
of accommodation with her &s;ubjects in Scotland; and after &s;ome rea&s;oning
on that head, it was agreed, that the Queen &s;hould require Lenox, the regent,
to &s;end up commi&s;&s;i|oners, to treat of conditions under her mediation.
The partizans of Mary boa&s;t|ed, that all terms were fully &s;ettled with the
court of England, and that the Scotch rebels would &s;oon be con&s;trained to
&s;ubmit to the re&s;toration of their &s;ove|reign: But Elizabeth took care
that the&s;e rumours &s;hould meet with no credit, and that the King's party
&s;hould not be di&s;couraged, nor &s;ink too low in their demands. Cecil wrote
to inform the regent, that all the Queen of England's propo&s;als, &s;o far
from being fixed and irrevocable, were to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed anew in the
conference; and de&s;ired him to &s;end commi&s;&s;ioners, who &s;hould be

which might be preju|dicial to their party<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood p. 245.</NOTE>. Su&s;&s;ex al&s;o, in his letters,
dropped hints to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; and Elizabeth her&s;elf &s;aid to the
abbot of Dunfermling, whom Lenox had &s;ent to the court of England, that &s;he
would not in&s;i&s;t on Mary's re&s;toration, provided the Scotch could make
the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e appear to her &s;atisfac|tion; and that even, if

told the Scotch commi&s;&s;ioners, that &s;he was no-wi&s;e &s;atisfied with
their rea&s;ons for ju&s;tifying the conduct of their countrymen; and that they
might therefore pro|ceed to propo&s;e the conditions, which they required for

authorized to treat, in any manner, concerning the re&s;toration of that
Prince&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Haynes, 623.</NOTE>, the conferences
were ne|ce&s;&s;arily at an end; and Elizabeth di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Scotch
commi&s;&s;ioners with in|junctions, that they &s;hould return, after having
procured more ample powers from their Parliament<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 249, 250, &amp;c. Le&s;ly, p. 133, 136. Camden, p.

profe&s;&s;ions; and Mary her&s;elf was no longer at a lo&s;s to judge of
Elizabeth's in&s;incerity. By rea&s;on of the&s;e di&s;appointments, matters
came &s;till nearer to extremity between the two Prince&s;&s;es; and the Queen
of Scots, finding all her hopes eluded, was more &s;trongly incited to make, at
all hazards, every po&s;&s;ible attempt for her li|berty and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>AN incident al&s;o happened about this time, which tended to
widen the breach between Mary and Elizabeth, and to encrea&s;e the vigilance
and jealou&s;y of the latter Prince&s;s. Pope Pius the fifth, who had
&s;ucceeded Paul, after having en|deavoured in vain to conciliate by gentle
means the friend&s;hip of Elizabeth, whom his predece&s;&s;or's violence had
irritated, i&s;&s;ued at la&s;t a bull of excommu|nication again&s;t her,
deprived her of all title to the crown, and ab&s;olved her &s;ub|jects from
their oaths of allegiance<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.

made in concert with Mary, who intended by that means to forward the northern
rebellion; a mea&s;ure, which was at that time pro|jected<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 441, from Caietanus Life of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">us the fifth.</NOTE>. John Felton
affixed this bull to the gates of the bi&s;hop of London's palace; and
&s;corning either to fly or deny the fact, he was &s;eized, and condemned, and
received the crown of martyrdom, for which he appears to have entertained &s;o
violent an ambition<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 428.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of April. A Parliament.</NOTE> A new
Parliament, after five years interval, was a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter;
and as the Queen, by the rage of the pope again&s;t her, was become &s;till
more <PB N="521" REF="124"> the head of the ruling party, it might be expected,
both from this incident and from her own prudent and vigorous conduct, that her
authority over the two hou&s;es would be ab&s;olutely uncontrouleable. It was
&s;o in fact; yet is it remark|able, that it prevailed not without &s;ome
&s;mall oppo&s;ition; and that too ari&s;ing chiefly from the height of zeal
for prote&s;tanti&s;m; a di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h, which, in general,
contributed extremely to encrea&s;e the Queen's popularity. We &s;hall be
&s;omewhat particular in relating the tran&s;actions of this fe&s;&s;ion,
be|cau&s;e they &s;how, as well the extent of the royal power during that age,
as the di&s;po&s;ition of Elizabeth and the genius of her government. It will
be curious al&s;o to ob&s;erve the faint dawnings of the &s;pirit of liberty in
the Engli&s;h, the jea|lou&s;y with which that &s;pirit was repre&s;&s;ed by
the &s;overeign, the imperious con|duct which was maintained in oppo&s;ition to
it, and the ea&s;e with which it was &s;ubdued by this arbitrary
Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Lord keeper, Bacon, after the &s;peaker of the commons was
elected, told the Parliament, in the Queen's name, that &s;he enjoined them not
to meddle with any matters of &s;tate<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p.
141.</NOTE>: Such was his expre&s;&s;ion; by which he probably meant, the
que&s;tions of the Queen's marriage and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, about which they
had before given her &s;ome trouble: For as to the other great points of
government, alliances, peace and war, or foreign negotiations; no Parliament in
that age ever had the pre&s;umption to take them under con&s;ideration, or
que&s;tion, in the&s;e par|ticulars, the conduct of their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>IN the former Parliament, the puritans had introduced &s;even
bills for a far|ther reformation in religion; but they had not been able to
prevail in any one of them<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 185.</NOTE>.
This hou&s;e of commons had &s;at a very few days, when Stricland, a member,
revived one of the bills, that for the amendment of the liturgy<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 156, 157.</NOTE>. The chief objection, which
he mentioned, was the &s;ign of the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m. Ano|ther member
added, the kneeling at the &s;acrament; and remarked, that if a po&s;|ture of
humiliation was requi&s;ite in that act of devotion, it were better, that the
communicants &s;hould throw them&s;elves pro&s;trate on the ground, in order to
keep at the wide&s;t di&s;tance from former &s;uper&s;tition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>RELIGION was a point, of which Elizabeth was, if po&s;&s;ible,
&s;till more jea|lous than of matters of &s;tate. She pretended, that, in
quality of &s;upreme head or governor of the church, &s;he was fully empowered,
by her prerogative alone, to decide all que&s;tions which might ari&s;e with
regard to doctrine, di&s;cipline, or wor|&s;hip; and &s;he never would allow
her Parliaments &s;o much as to take the&s;e points <PB N="522" REF="125"> into
con&s;ideration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 158.</NOTE>. The courtiers
forgot not to in&s;i&s;t on this topic: The trea&s;urer of the hou&s;hold, tho'
he allowed, that any here&s;y might be condemn|ed by Parliament, (a
conce&s;&s;ion which &s;eems to have been very ra&s;h and unguard|ed; &s;ince
the act, inve&s;ting the crown with the &s;upremacy, or rather acknow|ledging
that prerogative, gave the &s;overeign full power to reform all here&s;ies) yet
he affirmed, that it belonged to the Queen alone, as head of the church, to
regulate every que&s;tion of ceremony in wor&s;hip<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 166.</NOTE>. The comptroller &s;econded this argument;
in&s;i&s;ted on the extent of the Queen's prerogative; and &s;aid, that the
hou&s;e might, from former examples, have taken warning not to meddle with
&s;uch matters. One Pi&s;tor oppo&s;ed the&s;e remon&s;trances of the
courtiers. He was &s;candalized, he &s;aid, that affairs of &s;uch infinite
con&s;equence (viz. kneeling and making the &s;ign of the cro&s;s) &s;hould be
pa&s;&s;ed over &s;o lightly. The&s;e que&s;tions, he added, concern the
&s;alvation of our &s;ouls, and intere&s;t every one of us more deeply than the
monarchy of the whole world. This cau&s;e he &s;hewed to be God's; the re&s;t
were all but terrene, yea trifles in compari&s;on, call you them ever &s;o
great: Sub&s;idies, crowns, kingdoms, he knew not what weight they had, when
laid in the ballance with &s;ubjects of &s;uch un&s;peakable importance<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Tho' the zeal of this member &s;eems to
have been highly approved of, the hou&s;e, over|awed by the prerogative, voted
upon the que&s;tion, that a petition &s;hould be pre|&s;ented to her maje&s;ty,
for her licence to proceed farther in this bill; and in the mean time to &s;top
all debate or rea&s;oning concerning it<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MATTERS would probably have re&s;ted here, had not the Queen
been &s;o highly offended with Stricland's pre&s;umption, in moving the bill
for reformation of the liturgy, that &s;he &s;ent for him to the council, and
prohibited him thenceforth to appear in the hou&s;e of commons<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 175.</NOTE>. That act of power was too
violent even for this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Parliament to endure. Carleton took
notice of the matter, com|plained that the liberties of the hou&s;e were
violated; ob&s;erved that Stricland was not a private man, but repre&s;ented a
multitude; and moved, that he might be &s;ent for, and if he was guilty of any
offence, might an&s;wer for it at the bar of the hou&s;e, which he in&s;inuated
to be the only competent tribunal<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.
Yelverton enforced the principles of liberty with &s;till greater boldne&s;s.
He &s;aid, that the precedent was dangerous: And tho' in this happy time of
lenity, among &s;o many good and honourable per&s;onages as were at pre&s;ent
inve&s;ted with authority, no|thing of extremity or injury was to be
apprehended; yet the times might alter; what now is permitted, hereafter might
be con&s;trued as duty, and might be en|forced <PB N="523" REF="126"> even on
the ground of the pre&s;ent permi&s;&s;ion. He added, that all matters not
trea&s;onable, or which implied <HI>too much</HI> derogation of the imperial
crown, might, without offence, be introduced into Parliament; where every
que&s;tion that con|cerned the community, mu&s;t be con&s;idered, and where
even the right of the crown it&s;elf mu&s;t finally be determined. He remarked,
that men &s;at not in that hou&s;e in their private capacities, but as elected
by their country; and tho' it was proper, that the prince &s;hould retain his
prerogative, yet was that preroga|tive limited by law: As the &s;overeign could
not of him&s;elf make laws, neither could he break them, merely from his own
authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 175, 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE principles were popular, and noble, and generous; but the
open a&s;&s;er|tion of them was &s;omewhat new in England: And the courtiers
were more war|ranted by pre&s;ent practice, when they advanced a contrary
doctrine. The trea|&s;urer warned the hou&s;e to be cautious in their
proceedings; neither to venture farther than their a&s;&s;ured warrant might
extend, nor hazard their good opinion with her maje&s;ty in any doubtful

account of any liberty of &s;peech, but for the exhibit|ing a bill in the
hou&s;e again&s;t the prerogative of the Queen; a temerity which was not to be
tolerated. And he concluded with ob&s;erving, that even &s;peeches made in that
hou&s;e, have been que&s;tioned and examined by the &s;overeign<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 175.</NOTE>. Cleere, another member,
remarked, that the &s;overeign's prerogative is not &s;o much as di&s;putable,
and that the &s;afety of the Queen is the &s;afety of the &s;ubjects. He added,
that in que&s;tions of divinity, every man was for his in&s;truction to re|pair
to his ordinary; and he &s;eems to imply, that the bi&s;hops them&s;elves, for
their in&s;truction, mu&s;t repair to the Queen<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Mr. Fleetwood ob&s;erved, that, in his memory, he
knew a man, who, in the fifth of the pre&s;ent Queen, had been called to
account for a &s;peech in the hou&s;e. But left this example &s;hould be
e&s;teemed too recent, he would inform them, from the parliament rolls, that in
the reign of Henry the fifth, a bi&s;hop was committed to pri&s;on by the
King's command, on account of his freedom of &s;peech; and the Parliament
pre&s;umed not to go farther than to be humble &s;uitors for him: In the
&s;ub&s;equent reign, the &s;peaker him&s;elf was committed, with another
member; and the hou&s;e found no other remedy than a like &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive
application. He advi&s;ed the hou&s;e to have recour&s;e to the &s;ame
expedient; and not to pre&s;ume, either to &s;end for their member, or demand
him as of right<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. During this &s;peech, tho&s;e members of the

&s;peaker moved, that the hou&s;e &s;hould make &s;tay of all farther
proceedings: A motion, <PB N="524" REF="127"> which was immediately complied
with. The Queen, finding that the experiment which &s;he had made, was likely
to excite a great commotion, &s;aved her honour by this &s;ilence of the
hou&s;e; and that the que&s;tion might no more be re&s;umed, &s;he &s;ent next
day to Stricland her permi&s;&s;ion to give his attendance in Parlia|ment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this rebuke from the throne, the zeal of the
commons &s;till engaged them to continue the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e other
bills which regarded religion; but they were interrupted by a &s;till more
arbitrary proceeding of the Queen, in which the lords conde&s;cended to be her
in&s;trument. That hou&s;e &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the commons, de&s;iring that
a committee might attend them. Some members were accordingly appointed for that
purpo&s;e; and the upper hou&s;e in|formed them, that the Queen's maje&s;ty
being informed of the articles of reforma|tion which they had canva&s;&s;ed,
approved of them, intended to publi&s;h them, and to make the bi&s;hops execute
them, by virtue of her regal authority, as &s;u|preme head of the church of
England: But that &s;he would not permit them to be treated of in
Parliament<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 180, 185.</NOTE>. The
hou&s;e, tho' they did not entirely &s;top pro|ceedings on account of this
injunction, &s;eem no-wi&s;e to have been offended at &s;uch haughty treatment;
and in the i&s;&s;ue all their bills came to nothing.</P>
<P>A MOTION, made by Robert Bell, a puritan, again&s;t an
exclu&s;ive patent grant|ed to a company of merchants at Bri&s;tol<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 158.</NOTE>, gave al&s;o occa&s;ion to
&s;ome remark|able incidents. The Queen, &s;ome days after the motion was made,
&s;ent her or|ders, by the mouth of the &s;peaker, commanding the hou&s;e to
&s;pend little time in motions, and to avoid long &s;peeches. All the members
under&s;tood that &s;he had been offended, becau&s;e a matter had been moved
which &s;eemed to touch her prerogative<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
159.</NOTE>. Fleetwood accordingly &s;poke of this delicate &s;ubject. He
ob|&s;erved, that the Queen had a prerogative of granting patents; that to
que&s;tion the validity of any patent, was to invade the royal prerogative;
that all foreign trade was entirely &s;ubjected to the plea&s;ure of the
&s;overeign; that even the &s;tatute which gave liberty of commerce, admitted
of all prohibitions from the crown; and that the prince, when he granted an
exclu&s;ive patent, only employed the power ve&s;ted in him, and prohibited all
others from dealing in any particular branch of commerce. He quoted the Clerk
of the Parliament's book, to prove, that no man might &s;peak in Parliament of
the &s;tatute of wills, unle&s;s the King fir&s;t gave licence; becau&s;e the
royal prerogative in the wards was thereby touch|ed. He &s;hewed likewi&s;e the
&s;tatutes of Edward the fir&s;t, Edward the third, and Henry the fourth, with
a &s;aving of the prerogative. And in Edward the &s;ixth's 
<PB N="525" REF="128"> time, the protector was applied to, for his allowance to
mention matters of pre|rogative<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p.
160.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR Humphrey Gilbert, the gallant &s;ea-adventurer, carried
the&s;e topics &s;till farther. He endeavoured to prove, the motion made by
Bell; to be a vain de|vice, and perillous to be treated of; &s;ince it tended
to the derogation of the pre|rogative imperial, which, whoever &s;hould attempt
&s;o much as in fancy, could not, he &s;aid, be otherwi&s;e accounted than an
open enemy. For what difference is there between &s;aying, that the Queen is
not to u&s;e the privilege of the crown, and &s;aying that &s;he is not Queen?
And tho' experience has &s;hewn &s;o much cle|mency in her maje&s;ty, as might,
perhaps, make the &s;ubjects forget their duty; it is not good to &s;port or
venture too much with princes. He remembered them of the fable of the hare,
who, upon the proclamation, that all horned bea&s;ts &s;hould depart the court,
immediately fled, le&s;t his ears &s;hould be con&s;trued to be horns; and by
this apologue he &s;eems to in&s;inuate, that even tho&s;e who heard or
permitted &s;uch dangerous &s;peeches, would not them&s;elves be entirely free
from danger. He de&s;ired them to beware, le&s;t, if they meddled farther with
the&s;e matters, the Queen might look to her own power, and finding her&s;elf
able to &s;uppre&s;s their challenged liberty, and to exert an arbitrary
authority, might imi|tate the example of Lewis the eleventh of France, who, as
he termed it, deli|vered the crown from ward&s;hip<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 168.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' this &s;peech gave &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t, no body, at the
time, replied any thing, but that Sir Humphrey mi&s;took the meaning of the
hou&s;e, and of the member who made the motion: They never had other purpo&s;e,
than to repre&s;ent their grievances in due and &s;eemly form unto her
maje&s;ty. But, in a &s;ub&s;equent de|bate, Peter Wentworth, a man of a
&s;uperior free &s;pirit, called that &s;peech an in|&s;ult on the hou&s;e;
noted Sir Humphrey's di&s;po&s;ition to flatter and fawn on the prince;
compared him to the cameleon, which can change it&s;elf into all colours,
except white; and recommended to the hou&s;e, a due care of liberty of
&s;peech, and of the privileges of Parliament<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 175.</NOTE>. It appears, on the whole, that the mo|tion
again&s;t the exclu&s;ive patent had no effect. Bell, the member who fir&s;t
in|troduced it, was &s;ent for by the council, and was &s;everely reprimanded
for his temerity. He returned to the hou&s;e with &s;uch an amazed countenance,
that all the members, well informed of the rea&s;on, were &s;truck with terror;
and during &s;ome time, no one dur&s;t ri&s;e to &s;peak of any matter of
importance, for fear of giving offence to the Queen and the council. Even after
the fears of the com|mons were &s;omewhat abated, the members &s;poke with
extreme precaution; and <PB N="526" REF="129"> by employing mo&s;t of their
di&s;cour&s;e in preambles and apologies, they &s;hewed their con&s;cious
terror of the rod which was hanging over them. Wherever any delicate point was
touched; tho' ever &s;o gently; nay &s;eemed to be approached, tho' at ever
&s;o great a di&s;tance, the whi&s;per ran about the hou&s;e, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Queen will be offended; the council will be
extremely di&s;plea&s;ed:"</Q> And by the&s;e &s;ur|mizes men were warned of
the danger to which they expo&s;ed them&s;elves. It is remarkable, that the
patent which the Queen defended with &s;uch imperious vio|lence, was contrived
for the profit of four courtiers, and was attended with the utter ruin of
&s;even or eight thou&s;and of her indu&s;trious &s;ubjects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 242.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> THUS every thing which
pa&s;&s;ed the two hou&s;es, was extremely re&s;pectful and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive;
yet did the Queen think it incumbent on her, at the conclu&s;ion of the
&s;e&s;&s;ion, to check, and that with great &s;everity, tho&s;e feeble efforts
for liberty, which had appeared in the motions and &s;peeches of &s;ome
members. The lord keeper told the commons, in her maje&s;ty's name, that, tho'
the majority of the lower hou&s;e had &s;hewed them&s;elves, in their
proceedings, di&s;creet, and dutiful, yet a few of them had di&s;covered a
contrary character, and had ju&s;tly merited the reproach of audacious,
arrogant, and pre&s;umptuous: Contrary to their duty, both as &s;ubjects and
parliament-men, nay contrary to the expre&s;s injunctions given them from the
throne at the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion; injunctions, which it might well
have become them to have better attended to; they had pre&s;umed to call in
que&s;tion her maje&s;ty's grants and prerogatives. But her maje&s;ty warns
them, that &s;ince they will thus wilfully forget them&s;elves, they are
otherwi&s;e to be admoni&s;hed: Some other &s;pecies of correction mu&s;t be
found for them; &s;ince neither the commands of her maje&s;ty, nor the example
of their wi&s;er brethren, can reclaim their audacious, arrogant, and
pre&s;umptuous folly, by which they are thus led to meddle with what no way
belongs to them, and what lies not within the compa&s;s of their
under&s;tanding<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 151.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e tran&s;actions appears clearly the opinion which
Elizabeth had en|tertained of the duty and authority of Parliaments. They were
not to canva&s;s any matters of &s;tate: Still le&s;s were they to meddle with
the church. Que&s;tions of either kind were far above their reach, and were
appropriated to the prince alone, or to tho&s;e councils and mini&s;ters with
whom he was plea&s;ed to entru&s;t them. What then was the office of
Parliaments? They might give directions for the due tanning of leather, or
milling of cloth; for the pre&s;ervation of phea|&s;ants and partridges; for
the reparation of bridges and highways; for the pu|ni&s;hment of vagabonds or
common beggars. Regulations concerning the police of the country came properly
under their in&s;pection; and the laws of this kind <PB N="527" REF="130">
which they pre&s;cribed, had, if not a greater, yet a more durable authority,
than tho&s;e derived &s;olely from the proclamations of the &s;overeign.
Precedents or re|ports could fix a rule for deci&s;ions in private property, or
the puni&s;hment of crimes; but no alteration or innovation in the municipal
law could proceed from any other &s;ource than the Parliament; nor would the
courts of ju&s;tice be induced to change their e&s;tabli&s;hed practice by an
order of council. But the mo&s;t ac|ceptable part of parliamentary
tran&s;actions was the granting of &s;ub&s;idies; the attainting and
puni&s;hing the obnoxious nobility, or any mini&s;ter of &s;tate after his
fall; the countenancing &s;uch great efforts of power, as might be deemed
&s;ome|what exceptionable, where they proceeded entirely from the &s;overeign.
The re|dre&s;s of grievances was &s;ometimes promi&s;ed to the people; but
&s;eldom could have place, while it was an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule, that the
prerogatives of the crown mu&s;t not be abridged, or &s;o much as que&s;tioned
and examined in Parliament. Even tho' monopolies and exclu&s;ive companies had
already reached an enormous height, and were every day encrea&s;ing, to the
de&s;truction of all liberty, and extinction of all indu&s;try; it was criminal
in a member to propo&s;e, in the mo&s;t dutiful and regular manner, a
parliamentary application again&s;t any of them.</P>
<P>THESE maxims of government were not kept &s;ecret by Elizabeth,
or &s;moothed over by any fair appearances or plau&s;ible pretences. They were
openly avowed in her &s;peeches and me&s;&s;ages to Parliament; and were
accompanied with all the haughtine&s;s, nay &s;ometimes bitterne&s;s of
expre&s;&s;ion, which the meane&s;t &s;ervant could look for from his offended
ma&s;ter. Yet notwith&s;tanding this conduct, Elizabeth continued the mo&s;t
popular &s;overeign that ever &s;wayed the &s;cepter of England; becau&s;e the
maxims of her reign were conformable to the principles of the times, and to the
opinion which was generally entertained with regard to the con&s;titution. The
continued encroachments of popular a&s;&s;emblies on Eliza|beth's
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors have &s;o changed our ideas of the&s;e matters, that the
pa&s;&s;ages above mentioned appear to us extremely curious, and even at
fir&s;t &s;urprizing; but they were &s;o little remarked, during the time, that
neither Camden, tho' a contemporary writer, nor any other hi&s;torian, has
taken any notice of them. So ab&s;olute was the authority of the crown, that
the precious &s;park of liberty had been kindled, and was pre&s;erved, by the
puritans alone; and it was to this &s;ect, who&s;e principles appear &s;o
frivolous and habits &s;o ridiculous, that the Engli&s;h owe the whole freedom
of their con&s;titution. Actuated by that zeal which be|longs to innovators,
and by the courage which enthu&s;ia&s;m in&s;pires, they hazarded the utmo&s;t
indignation of their &s;overeign; and employing all their indu&s;try to be
elected into Parliament; a matter not difficult, while a feat was rather
regarded <PB N="528" REF="131"> as a burthen than an advantage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appeared this &s;e&s;&s;ion, that a bribe of four pounds

<P>THE following were the principal laws enacted this &s;e&s;&s;ion
of Parliament. It was declared trea&s;on, during the life-time of the Queen, to
affirm, that &s;he was not the lawful &s;overeign, or that any other
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a better title, or that &s;he was an heretic, &s;chi&s;matic,
or infidel, or that the laws and &s;tatutes cannot limit and de|termine the
right of the crown and the &s;ucce&s;&s;or thereof: To maintain in writing or
printing, that any per&s;on, except the <HI>natural i&s;&s;ue</HI> of her body,
is or ought to be the Queen's heir or &s;ucce&s;&s;or, &s;ubjected the per&s;on
and all his abettors, for the fir&s;t offence, to impri&s;onment during a year,
and to the forfeiture of half their goods: The &s;econd offence &s;ubjected
them to the penalty of a premunire<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Eliz. c. 1.</NOTE>. This law was
plainly leveled again&s;t the Queen of Scots and her partizans; and implyed an
avowal, that Elizabeth never intended to declare her &s;ucce&s;&s;or&punc; It
may be noted, that the u&s;ual phra&s;e of <HI>lawful i&s;&s;ue,</HI> which the
Parliament thought indecent towards the Queen, as if &s;he could be
&s;uppo&s;ed to have any other, was changed into that of <HI>natural
i&s;&s;ue.</HI> But this alteration was the &s;ource of great ridicule during
the time; and &s;ome per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected a deeper de&s;ign, as if
Leice&s;ter intended, in ca&s;e of the Queen's death, to produce &s;ome
ba&s;tard of his own, and affirm that he was her offspring<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 436.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was al&s;o enacted, that who&s;oever by bulls &s;hall
publi&s;h ab&s;olutions or other re&s;cripts of the pope, or &s;hall by means
of them reconcile any man to the church of Rome, &s;uch offenders, as well as
tho&s;e who were &s;o reconciled, &s;hould be guilty of trea&s;on. The penalty
of a premunire was impo&s;ed on every one who imported any <HI>Agnus Dei,</HI>
crucifix, or &s;uch other implement of &s;uper&s;tition, con|&s;ecrated by the
pope<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">13 Eliz. c. 2.</NOTE>. The former laws
again&s;t taking intere&s;t, which was de|nominated u&s;ury, were enforced by a
new &s;tatute<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 8.</NOTE>. A &s;upply of
one &s;ub&s;idy and two fifteenths was granted by Parliament. The Queen, as
&s;he was deter|mined to yield to them none of her power, was very cautious of
a&s;king from them any &s;upplies. She endeavoured, either by a rigid frugality
to make her ordinary revenues &s;uffice for the nece&s;&s;ities of the crown,
or &s;he employed her prerogative and acquired money by the granting of
patents, monopolies, or by &s;ome &s;uch ruinous expedient.</P>
<P>THO' Elizabeth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch uncontrouled authority
over her parliaments, and &s;uch exten&s;ive influence over her people; tho'
during a cour&s;e of thirteen <PB N="529" REF="132"> years, &s;he had been able
to maintain the public tranquillity, which was only in|terrupted by the ha&s;ty
and ill concerted in&s;urrection of the north; &s;he was &s;till kept in great
anxiety, and felt her throne perpetually totter under her. The violent
commotions, excited in France and the Low Countries, as well as in Scot|land,
&s;eemed in one view to &s;ecure her again&s;t any di&s;turbance; but they
&s;erved, on more reflection, to in&s;truct her in the danger of her
&s;ituation, when &s;he re|marked, that England, no le&s;s than the&s;e
neighbouring countries, contained the &s;eeds of inte&s;tine di&s;cord, the
differences of religious opinion, and the furious intolerance and animo&s;ity
of the oppo&s;ite &s;ectaries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars of France.</NOTE> THE league,
formed at Bayonne in 1566 for the extermination of the prote|&s;tants, had not
been concluded &s;o &s;ecretly but intelligence of it had reached Cond&eacute;,
Coligni, and the other leaders of the hugonots; and finding, that the
mea&s;ures of the court agreed with their &s;u&s;picions, they were determined
to prevent the cruel perfidy of their enemies, and to &s;trike a blow before
the catholics were aware of the danger. The hugonots, tho' di&s;per&s;ed over
the whole kingdom, formed a kind of empire within it&s;elf; and being clo&s;ely
united, as well by their religious zeal, as by the dangers, to which they were
perpetually expo&s;ed, they obeyed with entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion the orders of
their leaders, and were ready on every alarm to fly to arms. The King and
Queen-mother were living in great &s;ecurity at Monceaux in Brie; when they
found them&s;elves &s;urrounded by prote&s;tant troops, which had &s;ecretly
marched thither from all quarters; and had not a body of Swi&s;s come ha&s;tily
to their relief, and conducted them with great intrepidity to Paris, they
mu&s;t have fallen, without re&s;i&s;tance, into the hands of the
in&s;ur|gents. A battle was afterwards fought in the plains of St. Dennis,
where, tho' the old con&s;table Montmorency, the general of the catholics, was
killed combating bravely at the head of his troops, the hugonots were finally
defeated. Cond&eacute; collecting his broken troops, and receiving a &s;trong
reinforcement from the Ger|man prote&s;tants, appeared again in the field; and
laying &s;iege to Chartres, a place of great importance, obliged the court to
agree to a new accommodation. Such was the mutual animo&s;ity of the&s;e
religioni&s;ts, that, even had the leaders on both &s;ides been ever &s;o
&s;incere in their intentions for peace, and repo&s;ed ever &s;o great
con|fidence in each other, it would have been difficult to have retained the
people in tranquillity; much more, where &s;uch extreme jealou&s;y prevailed,
and where the court employed every pacification as a &s;nare for their enemies.
A plan was laid for &s;eizing the per&s;on of the prince and admiral; who
narrowly e&s;caped to Rochelle, and &s;ummoned their partizans to their
a&s;&s;i&s;tance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib. 4.</NOTE>. The civil wars
<PB N="530" REF="133"> were renewed with greater fury than ever, and the
parties became &s;till more ex|a&s;perated again&s;t each other. The young duke
of Anjou, brother to the King, commanded the forces of the catholics; and
fought in 1569 a great battle at Jarnac with the hugonots, where the prince of
Cond&eacute; was killed, and his army defeated. This di&s;comfiture, with the
lo&s;s of &s;o great a leader, reduced not the hugonots to de&s;pair. The
admiral &s;till &s;upported the cau&s;e; and having placed at the head of the
prote&s;tants, the prince of Navarre, then &s;ixteen years of age, and the
young prince of Cond&eacute;, he encouraged the party rather to peri&s;h
bravely in the field, than ignominiou&s;ly by the hands of the executioner. He
collected &s;uch numbers, &s;o determined to endure every extremity, that he
was enabled to make head again&s;t the duke of Anjou; and being &s;trengthened
by a new reinforcement of Germans, he obliged that prince to retreat and to
divide his forces. Coligni then laid &s;iege to Poitiers; and as the eyes of
all France were turned on this en|terprize, the duke of Gui&s;e, emulous of the
renown, which his father had ac|quired by the defence of Metz, threw him&s;elf
into the place, and &s;o animated the garri&s;on by his valour and conduct,
that the admiral was obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege. Such was the commencement
of that unrivaled fame and grandeur, after|wards attained by this duke of
Gui&s;e. The attachment, which all the catholics had borne to his father, was
immediately transferred to the &s;on; and men plea&s;ed them&s;elves in
comparing all the great and heroic qualities, which &s;eemed, in a manner,
hereditary in that family. Equal in affability, in munificence, in ad|dre&s;s,
in eloquence, and in every quality, which engages the affections of men; equal
al&s;o in valour, in conduct, in enterprize, in capacity; there &s;eemed only
this difference between them, that the &s;on, educated in more turbulent times,
and finding a greater di&s;&s;olution of all law and order, exceeded the father
in ambition and temerity, and was engaged in enterprizes &s;till more
de&s;tructive to the authority of his &s;overeign and to the repo&s;e of his
native country.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, who kept her attention fixed on the civil commotions
of France, was no wi&s;e plea&s;ed with this new ri&s;e of her enemies, the
Gui&s;es; and being anxious for the fate of the prote&s;tants, who&s;e
intere&s;ts were connected with her own<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p.
471.</NOTE>, &s;he was engaged, notwith&s;tanding her aver&s;ion again&s;t all
rebellion, and all oppo&s;ition to the will of the &s;overeign, to give them
&s;ecretly &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Be&s;ides employing her authority with the
German princes, &s;he &s;ent money to the Queen of Navarre, and received &s;ome
jewels as pledges for the loan. And &s;he permitted Henry Champernon to levy,
and tran&s;port over into France, a re|giment of an hundred gentlemen
voluntiers; among whom Walter Raleigh, then a young man, began to
di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in that great &s;chool of military va|lour

The admiral, con&s;trained by the impatience of his troops, and by the
difficulty of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting them, fought with the duke of Anjou, the battle
of Mon|contour in Poictou, where he was wounded and defeated. The court of
France, notwith&s;tanding their frequent experience of the ob&s;tinacy of the
hugonots, and the vigour of Coligni, vainly flattered them&s;elves that the
force of the rebels was at la&s;t finally annihilated; and they neglected
farther preparations again&s;t a foe, who, they thought, could never more
become dangerous. They were &s;ur|prized to hear, that that leader had appeared
in another quarter of the kingdom; had encouraged the young princes, whom he
governed, to equal con&s;tancy; had a&s;&s;embled an army; had taken the field;
and was even &s;trong enough to threaten Paris. The public finances,
dimini&s;hed by the continued di&s;orders of the king|dom, and wa&s;ted by &s;o
many fruitle&s;s military enterprizes, could no longer bear the charge of a new
armament; and the King, notwith&s;tanding his extreme ani|mo&s;ity again&s;t
the hugonots, was obliged, in 1570, to conclude an accommodation with them, to
grant them a pardon for all pa&s;t offences, and to renew the edicts for
liberty of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>THO' a pacification was &s;eemingly concluded, the mind of
Charles was no way reconciled to his rebellious &s;ubjects; and this
accommodation, like all the forego|ing, was nothing but a &s;nare, by which the
perfidious court had projected to de&s;troy at once, without danger, all its
formidable enemies. As the two young princes, the admiral, and all the leaders
of the hugonots, in&s;tructed by pa&s;t ex|perience, di&s;covered an extreme
di&s;tru&s;t of the King's intentions, and kept them|&s;elves in &s;ecurity, at
a di&s;tance, all po&s;&s;ible artifices were employed to remove their
apprehen&s;ions, and convince them of the &s;incerity of the new councils,
which &s;eemed to be embraced. The terms of the peace were exactly ob&s;erved
to them; the toleration was regularly maintained; all attempts, made by the
zealous catholics to infringe it, were puni&s;hed with &s;everity; offices, and
favours, and honours were be&s;towed on the principal nobility among the
prote&s;tants; and the King and council every where declared, that, tired of
civil di&s;orders, and convinced of the impo&s;&s;ibility of forcing men's
con&s;cience, they were thenceforth determined to allow every one the free
exerci&s;e of his religion.</P>
<P>AMONG the other artifices, employed to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ull the prote&s;tants into a fatal
&s;ecurity, Charles a&s;&s;ected to enter into clo&s;e connexions with
Elizabeth; and as it &s;eemed not the intere&s;t of France to forward the union
of the two kingdoms of Great Britain, that prince&s;s the more ea&s;ily
flattered her&s;elf, that the French monarch would prefer her friend&s;hip to
that of the Queen of Scots. The better to deceive her, propo&s;als of marriage
were made her with the duke of Anjou; a prince <PB N="532" REF="135"> who&s;e
youth, beauty, and reputation for valour might naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to
recommend him to a woman, who had appeared not altogether indifferent to
the&s;e endowments. The Queen immediately founded on this offer the project of
deceiv|ing the court of France; and being intent on the artifice of that
&s;cheme, &s;he laid her&s;elf the more open to be deceived. Negotiations were
entered into with regard to the marriage; terms of the contract were
propo&s;ed; difficulties &s;tarted and re|moved; and the two courts, equally
in&s;incere, tho' not equally criminal, &s;eemed to approach every day nearer
each other in their demands and conce&s;&s;ions. The great ob&s;tacle &s;eemed
to lie in adju&s;ting the differences of religion; becau&s;e Elizabeth, who
recommended toleration to Charles, was determined not to grant it in her own
dominions, not even to her hu&s;band; and the duke of Anjou &s;eemed unwilling
to &s;ubmit, for the &s;ake of intere&s;t, to the di&s;honour of an
apo&s;tacy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p 433. Davila&punc; lib. 5. Digges's
Compleat Amba&s;&s;ador, p. 84, 101, 111.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE artificial politics of Elizabeth never triumphed &s;o much
in any contivances as in tho&s;e which were conjoined with her coquetry; and as
her character in this particular was generally known, the court of France
thought that they might, without danger of forming any final conclu&s;ion,
venture the farther in their con|ce&s;&s;ions and offers to her. The Queen
al&s;o had other motives for di&s;&s;imulation. Be&s;ides the advantage of
di&s;couraging Mary's partizans by the pro&s;pect of an al|liance between
France and England, her &s;ituation with Philip demanded her ut|mo&s;t
vigilance and attention; and the pre&s;ent revolutions in the Low Countries
made her glad of fortifying her&s;elf even with the appearance of a new
con|federacy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of the Low Coun|tries.</NOTE> THE
theological controver&s;ies, which had long agitated Europe, had, from the
beginning, penetrated into the Low Countries; and as the&s;e provinces
main|tained a very exten&s;ive commerce, they had early received from every
king|dom, with which they corre&s;ponded, a tincture of religious innovation.
An opinion at that time prevailed, which had been zealou&s;ly propagated by the
prie&s;ts, and implicitly received by &s;overeigns, that here&s;y was clo&s;ely
connected with rebellion, and that every great or violent alteration in the
church involved a like revolution in the &s;tate and civil government. The
forward zeal of the reformers would &s;eldom allow them to wait the con&s;ent
of the magi&s;trate to their innovations; they became le&s;s dutiful when they
were oppo&s;ed and per|&s;ecuted; and tho' their pretended &s;pirit of
rea&s;oning and enquiry was in reality nothing but a new &s;pecies of implicit
faith, the prince took the alarm; as if no in&s;titutions could be &s;ecure
from the temerity of their re&s;earches. The emperor <PB N="533" REF="136">
Charles, who propo&s;ed to augment his authority under the pretence of
defending the catholic faith, ea&s;ily adopted the&s;e political principles;
and notwith&s;tanding the limited prerogative, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in
the Netherlands, he publi&s;hed the mo&s;t arbitrary, &s;evere, and tyrannical
edicts again&s;t the prote&s;tants, and he took care that the execution of them
&s;hould be no le&s;s violent and &s;anguinary. He was neither cruel nor
bigotted in his natural di&s;po&s;ition; yet an hi&s;torian, cele|brated for
moderation and caution, has computed, that, in the &s;everal per&s;ecu|tions,
promoted by that monarch, no le&s;s than an hundred thou&s;and per&s;ons
peri&s;hed by the hands of the executioner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grotii

&s;o far from an&s;wering the purpo&s;e intended, had rather &s;erved to
augment the numbers as well as zeal of the reformers; and the magi&s;trates of
the &s;everal towns, &s;eeing no end of tho&s;e barbarous executions, felt
their humanity rebel again&s;t their principles, and declined any farther
per&s;ecution of the new doc|trines.</P>
<P>WHEN Philip &s;ucceeded to his father's dominions, the Flemings
were ju&s;tly alarmed with new apprehen&s;ions; le&s;t their prince,
ob&s;erving the lenity of the magi&s;trates, &s;hould take the execution of the
edicts from &s;uch remi&s;s hands, and e&s;tabli&s;h the inqui&s;ition in the
Low Countries, accompanied with all the ini|quities and barbarities which
attended it in Spain. The &s;evere and unrelenting character of the man, his
profe&s;&s;ed attachment to Spani&s;h manners, the inflexible bigotry of his
principles; all the&s;e circum&s;tances encrea&s;ed their terror: And when he
left the Netherlands, with a known intention never to return, the di&s;|gu&s;t
of the inhabitants was extremely augmented, and their dread of tho&s;e
tyran|nical orders, which their &s;overeign, &s;urrounded with Spani&s;h
mini&s;ters, would i&s;&s;ue from his cabinet of Madrid. He left the dutche&s;s
of Parma governe&s;s of the Low Countries; and the natural good &s;en&s;e and
good temper of that prince&s;s, had &s;he been entru&s;ted with the &s;ole
power, would have pre&s;erved the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e opulent
provinces, which were lo&s;t from that refinement of treacherous and barbarous
politics, on which Philip &s;o highly valued him&s;elf. The Flemings
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ound, that the name alone of
regent remained with the dutche&s;s; that cardinal Granville po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
entirely the King's confidence; that attempts were every day made on their
liberties; that a re&s;olution was taken never more to a&s;&s;emble the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ates; that new bi&s;hoprics were
arbitrarily elected, in order to enforce the exe|cution of the per&s;ecuting
edicts; and that on the whole, they mu&s;t make ac+count of being reduced to
the condition of a province under the Spani&s;h mo|narchy. The di&s;contents of
the nobility gave countenance to the complaints of the <PB N="534" REF="137">
gentry, which encouraged the mutiny of the populace; and all orders of men
&s;howed a &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition to revolt. A&s;&s;ociations were formed,
tumultuary petitions pre&s;ented, names of di&s;tinction a&s;&s;umed, badges of
party di&s;played; and the current of the people, irritated by feeble
re&s;i&s;tance, and impelled by re|ligious zeal, ro&s;e to &s;uch a height,
that in &s;everal towns, particularly in Antwerp, they made an open inva&s;ion
on the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip, pillaged the churches and mona&s;teries,
broke the images, and committed the mo&s;t unwarrantable di&s;|orders.</P>
<P>THE wi&s;er part of the nobility, particularly the prince of
Orange, and the counts Egmont and Horn, were alarmed with the&s;e exce&s;&s;es,
to which their di&s;|contents had at fir&s;t given countenance; and &s;econding
the wi&s;dom of the go|verne&s;s, they &s;uppre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e dangerous
in&s;urrections, puni&s;hed the ringleaders, and reduced all the provinces to a
&s;tate of order and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But Philip was not contented with the
re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of his antient authority: He con|&s;idered, that
provinces, &s;o remote from the &s;eat of government, could not be ruled by a
limited prerogative; and that a prince, who mu&s;t entreat rather than command,
would nece&s;&s;arily, when he re&s;ided not among the people, feel every day a
diminution of his power and influence. He was determined, therefore, to lay
hold of the late popular mutinies as a pretence for aboli&s;hing entirely the
privileges of the Low Country provinces; and for ruling them thenceforth with a
military and arbitrary authority. In the execution of this violent de&s;ign, he
employed a man, who was a proper in&s;trument in the hands of &s;uch a tyrant.
Ferdinand of Toledo, duke of Alva, had been educated entirely amid&s;t arms;
and having attained a con&s;ummate knowlege in the military art, his habits led
him to transfer into all government the &s;evere di&s;cipline of a camp, and to
con|ceive no mea&s;ures between prince and &s;ubject but tho&s;e of rigid
command and implicit obedience. This general, in 1568, conducted from Italy to
the Low Countries a powerful body of veteran Spaniards; and his avowed
animo&s;ity to the Flemings, with his known character, &s;truck that whole
people with terror and con&s;ternation. It belongs not to our &s;ubject to
relate at length tho&s;e vi|olences, which Alva's natural barbarity, &s;teeled
by reflection, and aggravated by in&s;olence, exerci&s;ed on tho&s;e
flouri&s;hing provinces. It &s;uffices to &s;ay, that all their privileges, the
gift of &s;o many princes and the inheritance of &s;o many ages, were openly
and expre&s;sly aboli&s;hed by edict; arbitrary and &s;anguinary tribunals
erected; the counts Fgmont and Horn, notwith&s;tanding their great merits and
pa&s;t &s;ervices, brought to the &s;caffold; multitudes of all ranks thrown
into pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">on; and thence delivered
over to the executioner: And notwith&s;tanding the peaceable 
<PB N="535" REF="138"> &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of all men, nothing was heard of but
confi&s;cation, impri&s;onment, exile, torture, and death.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was equally di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee the progre&s;s of
that &s;cheme, laid for the extermination of the prote&s;tants, and to
ob&s;erve the erection of &s;o great a military power, in a &s;tate &s;ituated
&s;o near her. She gave protection to all the Fle|mi&s;h exiles who took
&s;helter in her dominions; and as many of the&s;e were the mo&s;t
indu&s;trious inhabitants of the Netherlands, and had rendered that country
&s;o celebrated for its arts, &s;he reaped the advantage of introducing into
England &s;ome u&s;eful manufactures, which were formerly unknown in that
kingdom. Fore&s;eeing that the violent government of Alva could not long
&s;ub&s;i&s;t without exciting &s;ome commotion, &s;he ventured to commit an
in&s;ult upon him, which &s;he would have been cautious not to hazard again&s;t
a more e&s;tabli&s;hed authority. Some Genoe&s;e merchants had engaged by
contract with Philip, to tran&s;port into Flanders the &s;um of four hundred
thou&s;and crowns; and the ve&s;&s;els in which this money was embarked, had
been attacked in the Channel by &s;ome privateers equip|ed by the French
Hugonots, and had taken &s;helter in Plymouth and Southamp|ton. The commanders
of the &s;hips pretended, that the money belonged to the King of Spain; but the
Queen finding, upon enquiry, that it was the property of Genoe&s;e merchants,
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it as a loan; and by that means de|prived the duke
of Alva of this re&s;ource in the time of his greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity. Alva,
in revenge, &s;eized all the Engli&s;h merchants in the Low Countries, threw
them into pri&s;on, and confi&s;cated their effects. The Queen retaliated by a
like violence on the Flemi&s;h and Spani&s;h merchants; and gave all the
Engli&s;h liberty to make reprizals on the &s;ubjects of Philip. The&s;e
differences were afterwards accommodated by treaty, and mutual reparations were
made to the merchants: But nothing could repair the lo&s;s which &s;o
well-timed a blow inflicted on the Spa|ni&s;h government in the Low Countries.
Alva, in want of money, and dreading the immediate mutiny of his troops, to
whom large arrears were due, impo&s;ed by his arbitrary will the mo&s;t ruinous
taxes on the people. He not only required the hundredth penny, and the
twentieth of all immoveable goods: He al&s;o de|manded the tenth of all
moveable goods on every &s;ale; an ab&s;urd tyranny, which would not only have
de&s;troyed all arts and commerce, but even have re&s;trained the common
intercour&s;e of life. The people refu&s;ed compliance: The duke had recour&s;e
to his u&s;ual expedient of hanging: And thus matters came &s;till nearer the
la&s;t extremity between the Flemings and the Spaniards<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bentivoglio, part I. lib. V. Camden, p.

<P>ALL the enemies of Elizabeth, in order to revenge them&s;elves

open|ed a &s;ecret intercour&s;e with that prince&s;s. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">New con&s;pi|racy of the duke of
Nor|folk.</NOTE> There was one Radolphi, a Floren|tine merchant, who had
re&s;ided about fifteen years at London, and who, at the &s;ame time that he

of Rome with the catholic nobility and gentry<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 123. State Trials, vol. I. p. 87.</NOTE>. He had been
thrown into pri&s;on at the time when the duke of Norfolk's intrigues with Mary
were di&s;covered; but either no proof was found again&s;t him, or the part
which he had acted was not very criminal; and he &s;oon after recovered his
liber|ty. This man, zealous for promoting the catholic faith, had formed a
&s;cheme, in concert with the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, for &s;ubverting the
government, by a fo|reign inva&s;ion, and a dome&s;tic in&s;urrection; and when
he communicated his pro|ject, by letter, to Mary, he found, that as &s;he was
now fully convinced of Eli|zabeth's artifices, and de&s;paired of ever
recovering her authority, or even her li|berty, by pacific mea&s;ures, &s;he
very willingly gave her concurrence. The great number of di&s;contented
catholics were the chief &s;ource of their hopes on the &s;ide of England; and
they al&s;o ob&s;erved, that the kingdom was, at that time, full of indigent
gentry, chiefly younger brothers, who having at pre&s;ent, by the late decay of
the church, and the yet langui&s;hing &s;tate of commerce, no pro&s;pect of a
livelihood &s;uitable to their birth, were ready to throw them&s;elves into any
de&s;|perate enterprize<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p.

male|contents, it was requi&s;ite, that &s;ome great nobleman &s;hould put
him&s;elf at their head; and no one appeared to Rodolphi, and to the bi&s;hop
of Ro&s;s, who en|tered into all the&s;e intrigues, &s;o proper, both on
account of his power and his po|pularity, as the duke of Norfolk.</P>
<P>THIS nobleman, when relea&s;ed from confinement in the Tower,
had given his promi&s;e, that he would drop all intercour&s;e with the Queen of
Scots<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 571.</NOTE>; but find|ing that he had
lo&s;t, and, as he feared, beyond all recovery, the confidence and favour of
Elizabeth, and being &s;till, in &s;ome degree, re&s;trained from his li|berty,
he was tempted, by impatience and de&s;pair, to violate his word, and to open
anew his corre&s;pondence with the captive prince&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 102.</NOTE>. A promi&s;e of mar|riage was
renewed between them; the duke engaged to enter into all her intere&s;ts; and
as his remor&s;es gradually decayed in the cour&s;e of the&s;e tran&s;actions,
he was pu&s;hed to give his a&s;&s;ent to enterprizes &s;till more criminal.
Rodolphi's plan was, that the duke of Alva &s;hould, under &s;ome other
pretence, a&s;&s;emble a great quan|tity of &s;hipping in the Low Countries;
&s;hould tran&s;port a body of &s;ix thou&s;and foot, and four thou&s;and
hor&s;e, into England; &s;hould land them at Harwich, <PB N="537" REF="140">
where the duke of Norfolk was to join them with all his friends; &s;hould

87.</NOTE>. Norfolk gave his con&s;ent to this plan; and three letters, in
con&s;equence of it, were wrote in his name by Rodolphi to Alva, the pope, and
the King of Spain; but the duke, apprehen&s;ive of the dan|ger, refu&s;ed to
&s;ign them<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 159, 161. Camden, p.

confident, named Barker, as well to notify his concurrence in the plan, as to
vouch the authenticity of the&s;e letters; and Rodolphi, having obtained a
letter of credence from the amba&s;&s;ador, proceeded on his journey to
Bru&s;&s;els and to Rome. The duke of Alva and the pope embraced the &s;cheme
with alacrity: Rodolphi informed Norfolk of their intentions<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 93.</NOTE>: and every thing &s;eemed to
concur in forwarding the undertaking.</P>
<P>NORFOLK, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e criminal enterprizes, had
never entirely for|got his duty to his &s;overeign, his country, and his
religion; and tho' he had laid the plan both for an inva&s;ion and an
in&s;urrection, he &s;till flattered him&s;elf, that the innocence of his
intentions would ju&s;tify the violence of his mea&s;ures, and that, as he
aimed at nothing but the liberty of the Queen of Scots, and the obtaining
Elizabeth's con&s;ent to his marriage, he could not ju&s;tly reproach him&s;elf
as a rebel and a traitor<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">8.</NOTE>. It is certain, however,
that, con&s;idering the Queen's vi|gour and &s;pirit, the &s;cheme, if
&s;ucce&s;sful, mu&s;t finally have ended in her dethrone|ment; and her
authority was here expo&s;ed to the utmo&s;t danger. The con&s;pi|racy had
hitherto entirely e&s;caped the vigilance of Elizabeth, and that of
&s;ecre|tary Cecil, who now bore the title of lord Burleigh. It was from
another attempt of Norfolk, that they fir&s;t obtained a hint, which, being
diligently traced, led at la&s;t to a full di&s;covery. Mary had intended to
&s;end a &s;um of money to lord Herreis, and her partizans in Scotland; and
Norfolk undertook to have it con|veyed to Banni&s;ter, a &s;ervant of his, at
that time in the north, who was to find &s;ome expedient to have it delivered
to lord Herreis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 169. State Trials, vol. I. p.

He entru&s;ted the money to a &s;ervant, who was not in the &s;ecret, and told
him that the bag contained a &s;um of &s;ilver, which he was to deliver to
Banni&s;ter with a letter: But the &s;er|vant, conjecturing from the weight and
&s;ize of the bag, that it was full of gold, carried the letter to Burleigh;
who immediately ordered Banni&s;ter, Barker, and Hicford, the duke's
&s;ecretary, to be put under arre&s;t, and to undergoe a &s;evere examination.
The fear of torture made them confe&s;s the whole truth; and as Hicford, tho'
ordered to burn all papers, had carefully kept them concealed un|der 
<PB N="538" REF="141"> the mats of the duke's chamber, and under the tiles of
the hou&s;e, full evi|dence now appeared again&s;t his ma&s;ter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 173</NOTE>. Norfolk him&s;elf, who was
entirely ignorant of the di&s;coveries made by his &s;ervants, was brought
before the council, and tho' exhorted to attone for his guilt by a full
confe&s;&s;ion, he per&s;i&s;ted in deny|ing every accu&s;ation with which he

his &s;incere repentance, &s;he would have pardoned all his former
offences<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 175.</NOTE>; but finding him
ob&s;tinate, &s;he committed him to the Tower, and ordered him to be brought to

to cu&s;tody before the di&s;covery of Norfolk's guilt; and every expedient was
employed to make him reveal his &s;hare in the con&s;piracy. He at fir&s;t
in&s;i&s;ted on his privilege as an amba&s;&s;ador; but he was told, that as
his mi&s;tre&s;s was no longer a &s;overeign, he would not be regarded as an

her apology; and the Par|liament was &s;o enraged again&s;t her, that the
commons made a direct application for her immediate trial and execution. They
employed &s;ome topics derived from practice and rea&s;on, and the laws of

dangerous to all the principles of humanity and morality. Matters were here
carried to greater extremity than Elizabeth intended; and being &s;atisfied
with &s;hewing Mary the di&s;po&s;ition of the nation, &s;he &s;ent to the

intere&s;t prevailed in the hou&s;e, than the intemperate u&s;e of authorities
derived from &s;crip|ture, e&s;pecially from the Old Te&s;tament; and the Queen
was &s;o little a lover of that &s;ect, that &s;he was not likely to make any

<P>BUT tho' Elizabeth would not proceed to &s;uch extremities
again&s;t Mary, as were recommended to her by the Parliament, &s;he was alarmed
with the great intere&s;t and the re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of that prince&s;s, as
well as her clo&s;e connections with Spain; and &s;he thought it nece&s;&s;ary

management of Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 152.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch affairs.</NOTE> That kingdom remained
&s;till in a &s;tate of anar|chy. The ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, commanded by
Kirkaldy of Grange, had de|clared for the Queen; and the lords of that party,
encouraged by his countenance, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the capital, and
carried on a vigorous war again&s;t the regent. By a &s;udden and unexpected
inroad, they &s;eized that nobleman at Stir|ling; but finding that his friends,
&s;allying from the ca&s;tle, were likely to relieve him, they in&s;tantly put
him to death. The earl of Marre was cho&s;en regent in his place; and found the
&s;ame difficulties to encounter in the government of that divided country. He
was therefore glad to accept of the mediation of the French and Engli&s;h
amba&s;&s;adors, and to conclude on equal terms a truce with the Queen's
party<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 263.</NOTE>. He was a man
of a free and generous &s;pirit, and &s;corned to &s;ubmit to any dependance on
England; and for this rea&s;on Elizabeth, who had formed clo&s;e connections
with France, yielded with le&s;s reluctance to the &s;ollicita|tions of that
court, &s;till maintained the appearance of neutrality between the par|ties,
and allowed matters to remain on a ballance in Scotland<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 156, 165, 169.</NOTE>. But affairs &s;oon
after took a new turn, Marre died of melancholy, with which the di&s;tracted
&s;tate of the country affected him: Morton was cho&s;en regent; and as this
nobleman had &s;ecretly taken all his mea&s;ures with Elizabeth, who no longer
relied on the friend&s;hip of the French court, &s;he re&s;olved to exert
her&s;elf more effectually for the &s;upport of that party, whom &s;he had
always favoured. She &s;ent Sir Henry Killigrew amba&s;&s;ador into Scotland,
who found Mary's partizans &s;o di&s;couraged by the di&s;covery and
puni&s;hment of Norfolk's con&s;piracy, that they were glad to &s;ubmit to the
King's authority, and accept of an indemnity for all pa&s;t of|fences<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 268.</NOTE>. The duke of Chatelrault,
and the earl of Huntley, with the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable of Mary's friends,
laid down their arms on the&s;e conditions. The gar|ri&s;on alone of the
ca&s;tle of Edinburgh continued refractory. Kirkaldy's fortunes were
de&s;perate; and he flattered him&s;elf with a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Kings of
France and Spain, who encouraged his ob&s;tinacy, in hopes of being able, from
that quarter, to give di&s;turbance to England. Elizabeth was alarmed with the
dan|ger; <PB N="541" REF="144"> &s;he no more apprehended the coming to
extremity with the Queen of Scots, who, &s;he found, could not any longer be

pacification of Scotland would be an ea&s;y, as well as a mo&s;t important

march with &s;ome troops and artillery to Edinburgh, and to be&s;iege the

died &s;oon after a voluntary death, as is &s;uppo&s;ed; and Scotland,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">French affairs.</NOTE> THE events which

the Hugonots, gave them good rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the pre&s;ent intentions
of the court; and after all the other leaders of that party were deceived into
a dangerous credulity, the &s;agacious admiral &s;till remained doubtful and
uncertain. But his &s;u&s;picions were at la&s;t overcome, partly by the
profound di&s;&s;imulation of Charles, partly by his own earne&s;t de&s;ire to
end the mi&s;eries of France, and return again to the performance of his duty
towards his prince and country. He con&s;idered be&s;ides, that as the former
violent conduct of the court had ever met with &s;uch fatal &s;ucce&s;s, it was
not unlikely, that a prince, who had newly come to years of di&s;cretion, and
was not rivetted in any dangerous animo&s;ities or prejudices, would be induced
to govern him&s;elf by more moderate maxims. And as Charles was young, was of a
pa&s;&s;ionate ha&s;ty temper, and addicted to plea&s;ure<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 8, 39.</NOTE>, &s;uch deep perfidy &s;eemed either

admiral, the Queen of Navarre, and all the Hugonots began to repo&s;e
them|&s;elves in full &s;ecurity, and gave credit to the treacherous

<P><PB N="542" REF="145"> THE better to blind the eyes of the
jealous Hugonots, and draw their leaders into the &s;nare prepared for them,
Charles offered his &s;i&s;ter, Margaret, in mar|riage to the prince of

had come to Paris, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the celebration of the&s;e
nuptials, which, it was hoped, would finally, if not compo&s;e the differences,
at lea&s;t appea&s;e the bloody animo&s;ity of the two religions. The Queen of

a general ma&s;&s;acre of the&s;e religioni&s;ts, and the King him&s;elf in

with|out any preparation, the fury of the court; and all conditions, ages and
&s;exes, &s;u&s;pected of any propen&s;ity to that religion, were involved in
an undi&s;tingui&s;hed ruin. The admiral, his &s;on-in-law Teligni, Soubize,

di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves by the mo&s;t heroic actions, were mi&s;erably

the populace, more enraged than &s;a|tiated with their cruelty, as if repining
that death had &s;aved the victims from far|ther in&s;ult, exerci&s;ed on their
dead bodies all the rage of the mo&s;t licentious bru|tality. About five

general execution of the prote&s;tants; and in Ro&uuml;en, Lyons, and many
other cities, the people emulated the fury of the ca|pital. Even the murder of
the King of Navarre, and the prince of Cond&eacute;, had been propo&s;ed by the
duke of Gui&s;e; but Charles, &s;oftened by the amiable man|ners of the King of
Navarre, and hoping that the&s;e young princes might ea&s;ily be converted to
the catholic faith, was determined to &s;pare their lives, tho' he ob|liged
them to purcha&s;e their &s;afety by a &s;eeming change of their religion.</P>
<P>CHARLES, in order to cover this barbarous perfidy, pretended,
that a con&s;pi|racy of the Hugonots to &s;eize his per&s;on had been
&s;uddenly di&s;covered; and that he had been nece&s;&s;itated, for his own
defence, to proceed to this &s;everity again&s;t them. He &s;ent orders to
Fenelon, his amba&s;&s;ador in England, to a&s;k an audi|ence, and to give
Elizabeth this account of the late tran&s;action. That mini|&s;ter, who was a
man of probity, abhorred the treachery and cruelty of his court, and even
&s;crupled not to declare, that he was now a&s;hamed to bear the name of a
Frenchman<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 247.</NOTE>; yet was he
obliged to obey his orders, and make u&s;e of the apo|logy, 
<PB N="543" REF="146"> which had been pre&s;cribed to him. He met with that
reception from all the courtiers, which, he knew, the conduct of his ma&s;ter
had &s;o well merited. Nothing could be more awful and affecting than the
&s;olemnity of his audience. A melancholy &s;orrow &s;at on every face:
Silence, as in the dead of night, reigned thro' all the chambers of the royal
apartment: The courtiers and ladies, clad in deep mourning, were ranged on each
&s;ide, and allowed him to pa&s;s, without affording him one &s;alute or
favourable look; till he was admitted to the Queen her&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carte, vol. III. p. 522. from Fenelon's Di&s;patches.</NOTE>. That
prince&s;s received him with a more ea&s;y, if not a more gracious countenance;
and heard his apology, without di&s;covering any vi&s;ible &s;ymptoms of
indignation. She told him, that, tho', on the fir&s;t rumour of this dreadful
intelligence, &s;he had been a&s;toni&s;hed, that &s;o many brave men and loyal
&s;ubjects, who re&s;ted &s;ecure on the faith of their &s;overeign, &s;hould
have been &s;uddenly butchered in &s;o barbarous a manner; &s;he had hitherto
&s;u&s;pended her judgment, till farther and more certain information &s;hould
be brought her: That the account, which he had given, even if founded on no
mi&s;take or bad information; tho' it might alleviate, would by no means remove
the blame of the King's coun&s;ellors, or ju&s;tify the &s;trange irregularity
of their proceedings: That the &s;ame force, which without re&s;i&s;tance had
ma&s;&s;acred &s;o many defencele&s;s men, could ea&s;ily have &s;ecured their
per&s;ons, and have re&s;erved them for a trial, and for puni&s;hment by a
formal &s;entence, which would have di&s;tingui&s;hed the innocent from the
guilty: That the admiral in particular, being dangerou&s;ly wounded, and
environed by the guards of the King, on who&s;e protection he &s;eemed entirely
to rely, had no means of e&s;cape, and might &s;urely, before his death, have
been convicted of the crimes imputed to him: That it was more worthy of a
&s;overeign to re|&s;erve in his own hands the &s;word of ju&s;tice, than to
commit it to bloody mur|derers, who, being the declared and mortal enemies of
the per&s;ons accu&s;ed, em|ployed it without mercy and without di&s;tinction:
That if the&s;e &s;entiments were ju&s;t, even &s;uppo&s;ing the con&s;piracy
of the prote&s;tants to be real; how much more, if that crime was nothing but a
calumny of their enemies, invented for their ruin and de&s;truction? That if
upon enquiry the innocence of the&s;e unhappy victims &s;hould afterwards
appear, it was the King's duty to turn his vengeance on their enemies and
calumniators, who had thus cruelly abu&s;ed his confidence, had murdered &s;o
many of his brave &s;ubjects, and bad done what in them lay to cover him with
infamy and di&s;honour: And that for her part, &s;he &s;hould form her judgment
of his intentions by his &s;ub&s;equent conduct; and in the mean time 
<PB N="544" REF="147"> &s;hould act as de&s;ired by the amba&s;&s;ador, and

<P>ELIZABETH was fully &s;en&s;ible of the dangerous &s;ituation in

of that general con&s;piracy, which had been formed, for the extermination of
the prote&s;tants; and &s;he knew, that &s;he her&s;elf, as the head and
protector of that religion, was expo&s;ed to the utmo&s;t fury and re&s;entment
of the catholics. The violences and cruelties of the Spaniards in the Low
Countries were another branch of the &s;ame con&s;piracy; and as Charles and
Philip, two princes nearly allied in perfidy and barbarity, as well as in
bigotry, had now laid a&s;ide their pretended quarrel, and had avowed the
mo&s;t entire friend&s;hip<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 268, 282.</NOTE>,
&s;he had rea&s;on, &s;o &s;oon as they had appea&s;ed their dome&s;tic
commotions, to dread the effects of their united councils. The duke of Gui&s;e
al&s;o and his family, whom Charles, in order to deceive the admiral, had
hitherto kept at a di&s;tance, had now acquired an open and entire a&s;cendant
in the court of France; and &s;he was &s;en&s;ible, that the&s;e princes, from
per&s;onal as well as political rea&s;ons, were her declared and implacable
enemies. The Queen of Scots, their near relation and clo&s;e confederate, was
the pretender to her throne; and tho' detained in cu&s;tody, was actuated by a
re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit, and be&s;ides her foreign allies, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed very
numerous and zealous partizans in the heart of the kingdom. For the&s;e
rea&s;ons, Elizabeth thought it more prudent not to break all terms with the
French monarch; but &s;till to li&s;ten to the pro|fe&s;&s;ions of
friend&s;hip, which he made her. She allowed even the negotiati|ons to be

her fleet in order, exerci&s;ed her militia, cultivated popularity with her

no <PB N="546" REF="149"> &s;ooner heard of his brother's death, than he
ha&s;tened to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown of France; and found the
kingdom, not only involved in the greate&s;t pre&s;ent di&s;orders, but
expo&s;ed to infirmities, for which it was extremely difficult to provide any
&s;uitable remedy. <MILESTONE N="1575" UNIT="year"> The people were divided
into two theological factions, furious from their zeal, and mutually enraged
from the injuries which they had committed or received; and as all faith had
been violated and mode|ration bani&s;hed, it &s;eemed impracticable to frame
any terms of compo&s;ition be|tween them. Each party had devoted it&s;elf to
leaders, who&s;e commands had more authority than the will of the &s;overeign;
and even the catholics, to whom the King was attached, were conducted entirely
by the councils of Gui&s;e and his family. The religious connexions had, on
both &s;ides, &s;uperceded the civil; or rather (for men will always be guided
by pre&s;ent intere&s;t) two empires being &s;ecretly formed in the kingdom,
every individual was engaged by new views of intere&s;t to follow tho&s;e
leaders, to whom, during the cour&s;e of pa&s;t convul&s;ions, he had been
indebted for his honours and preferment. Henry, ob&s;erving the low condition
of the crown, had laid a &s;cheme of re&s;toring his own authority, by acting
as umpire between the parties, by moderating their differences, and by reducing
both to a dependance upon him&s;elf. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the talents of
di&s;&s;imulation requi&s;ite for the execution of this delicate plan; but
being deficient in vigour, application, and &s;ound under&s;tanding, in&s;tead
of acquiring a &s;uperi|ority over both factions, he lo&s;t the confidence of
both, and taught the parti|zans of each to adhere more clo&s;ely to their
particular leaders, whom they found more hearty, cordial, and &s;incere, in the
cau&s;e, which they pur&s;ued. <MILESTONE N="1576" UNIT="year"> The hu|gonots
were fortified by the acce&s;&s;ion of a German army under the prince of
Cond&eacute; and prince Ca&s;imir; but much more, by the credit and per&s;onal
virtues of the King of Navarre, who, having fled from court, had placed
him&s;elf at the head of that formidable party. Henry, in pro&s;ecution of his
plan, entered into a compo&s;ition with them; and being de&s;irous of
pre&s;erving a balance between the facts, he granted them peace on the mo&s;t
advantageous conditions. This was the fifth general peace made with the
hugonots; but tho' it was no more &s;incere on the part of the court than any
of the former, it gave the highe&s;t di&s;|gu&s;t to the catholics; and
afforded the duke of Gui&s;e the de&s;ired pretence of declaiming again&s;t the
mea&s;ures, and maxims, and conduct of the King. That artful and bold leader
took thence an occa&s;ion of reducing his party into a more formed and regular
body; and he laid the fir&s;t foundations of the famous LEAGUE, which, without
any regard to the royal authority, aimed at the entire &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the
hugonots. Such was the unhappy condition of France, from the pa&s;t
&s;everities and violences of its princes, that toleration could no longer be
admitted; <PB N="547" REF="150"> and a conce&s;&s;ion for liberty of
con&s;cience, which would have probably appea&s;ed the reformers, excited the
mo&s;t violent re&s;entment and animo&s;ity in the catholics.
<MILESTONE N="1577" UNIT="year"> Henry, in order to divert the force of the
league from him&s;elf, and even to clude its efforts again&s;t the hugonots,
declared him&s;elf the head of that &s;editious confederacy, and took the field
as leader of the Romani&s;ts. But his dilatory and feeble mea&s;ures
di&s;covered his reluctance to the undertaking; and after &s;ome
un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts, he concluded a new peace, which, tho' le&s;s
favorable than the former to the prote&s;tants, gave no contentment to the
catholics. <MILESTONE N="1578" UNIT="year"> Mutual diffidence &s;till
prevailed between the parties; the King's moderation was &s;u&s;pi|cious to
both; each faction continued to fortify it&s;elf again&s;t that breach, which,
they fore&s;aw, mu&s;t &s;peedily en&s;ue; theological controver&s;y daily
whetted the ani|mo&s;ity of the &s;ects; and every private injury became the
ground of a public quarrel. The King, hoping, by his artifice and &s;ubtlety,
to allure the nation into a love of plea&s;ure and repo&s;e, was him&s;elf
caught in the &s;nare; and &s;inking into di&s;&s;olutene&s;s and indolence,
wholly lo&s;t the e&s;teem, and, in a great mea&s;ure, the affections of the
nation. In&s;tead of advancing &s;uch men of character and ability, as were
neuters between the&s;e dangerous factions, he gave all his confidence to young
agreeable favourites, who, unable to prop his falling authority, leaned
en|tirely upon it, and encrea&s;ed the general odium again&s;t his
admini&s;tration. The public burthens, encrea&s;ed by his profu&s;e liberality,
and feeling more heavy on a di&s;ordered kingdom, became another ground of
complaint; and the uncontrouled animo&s;ity of parties, joined to the
multiplicity of taxes, rendered peace more calamitous than any open &s;tate of
foreign or even dome&s;tic ho&s;tility. <MILESTONE N="1579" UNIT="year"> The
arti|fices of the King were too refined to &s;ucceed, and too frequent to be
concealed; and the plain, direct, and avowed conduct of the duke of Gui&s;e on
the one &s;ide, and that of the King of Navarre on the other, drew by degrees
the generality of the nation to devote them&s;elves without re&s;erve to the
one or the other of tho&s;e great leaders.</P>
<P>THE civil commotions of France were of too great importance to
be over|looked by the other princes of Europe; and Elizabeth's fore&s;ight and
vigilance, tho' &s;omewhat re&s;trained by her frugality, led her to take
&s;ecretly &s;ome part in them. Be&s;ides employing on all occa&s;ions her good
offices in favour of the hu|gonots, &s;he had expended no incon&s;iderable
&s;ums of money in levying that army of Germans, which the prince of
Cond&eacute; and prince Ca&s;imir conducted into France<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 452.</NOTE>; and notwith&s;tanding all her
negotiations with the court, and her profe&s;&s;ions of amity, &s;he always
con&s;idered her own intere&s;ts as connected with the pro&s;perity of the
French prote&s;tants and the depre&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e. Philip,
on <PB N="548" REF="151"> the other hand, had declared him&s;elf protector of
the league; had entered into the clo&s;e&s;t corre&s;pondence with Gui&s;e; and
had employed all his authority in &s;up|porting the credit of that factious
leader. The &s;ympathy of religion, which of it&s;elf begot a connexion of
intere&s;ts, was one con&s;iderable inducement; but that mo|narch had al&s;o in
view, the &s;ubduing his rebellious &s;ubjects in the Nether|lands; who, as
they received great encouragement from the French prote&s;tants, would, he
hoped, finally de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s, after the entire &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of
their friends and confederates.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars of the Low Countries.</NOTE> THE
&s;ame political views, which engaged Elizabeth to &s;upport the hu|gonots,
would have led her to a&s;&s;i&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed prote&s;tants in the
Low Countries; but the mighty power of Philip, the tranquillity of all his
other dominions, and the great force, which he maintained in the&s;e mutinous
provinces, kept her in awe, and obliged her, notwith&s;tanding all temptations
and all provocations, to pre&s;erve &s;ome terms of amity with that monarch.
The Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador remon&s;trated with her, that many of the
Flemi&s;h exiles, who infe&s;ted the &s;eas, and preyed on his ma&s;ter's
&s;ubjects, were received into the har|bours of England, and were there
permitted to di&s;po&s;e of their prizes; and by the&s;e remon&s;trances the
Queen found her&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of denying them all entrance into
her dominions. But this mea&s;ure proved in the i&s;&s;ue extremely prejudicial
to the intere&s;ts of Philip. The&s;e de&s;perate exiles, finding no longer any
po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, were forced to attempt the mo&s;t
perillous enter|prizes; and they made an a&s;&s;ault on the Brille, a &s;eaport
town in Holland, where they met with &s;ucce&s;s, and, after a &s;hort
re&s;i&s;tance, became ma&s;ters of the place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden,
p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>. The duke of Alva was
alarmed with the danger; and &s;topping tho&s;e bloody executions, which he was
making on the defencele&s;s Flemings, he ha&s;tened with his army to
extingui&s;h the flame, which, falling on materials &s;o well prepared for
combu&s;tion, &s;eemed to menace a general conflagration. His fears &s;oon
appeared to be well grounded. The people in the neighbourhood of the Brille,
enraged by that complication of cruelty, oppre&s;&s;ion, in&s;olence,
u&s;urpa|tion, and per&s;ecution, under which they laboured, flew to arms; and
in a few days almo&s;t the whole provinces of Holland and Zealand had revolted
from the Spaniards, and had openly declared again&s;t the tyranny of Alva. This
event happened in the year 1572.</P>
<P>WILLIAM, prince of Orange, de&s;cended from a &s;overeign family
of great lu&s;tre and antiquity in Germany, inheriting the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
of a &s;overeign family in France, had fixed his re&s;idence in the Low
Countries; and on account of his <PB N="549" REF="152"> noble birth and
immen&s;e riches, as well as of his per&s;onal virtues, was univer|&s;ally
regarded as the greate&s;t &s;ubject, who lived in tho&s;e provinces. He had
op|po&s;ed by all regular and dutiful means the progre&s;s of the Spani&s;h
u&s;urpations; and when Alva conducted his army into the Netherlands, and
a&s;&s;umed the go|vernment, this prince, well acquainted with the violent
character of the man, and the tyrannical &s;pirit of the court of Madrid,
wi&s;ely fled from the danger which threatened him, and retired to his paternal
e&s;tate and dominions in Germany. He was cited to appear before Alva's
tribunal, was condemned in ab&s;ence, was declared a rebel, and his ample
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Low Countries were confi&s;cated. In revenge, he
levied an army of prote&s;tants in the empire, and made &s;ome at|tempts to
re&s;tore the Flemings to liberty; but was &s;till repul&s;ed with lo&s;s by
the vigilance and military conduct of Alva, and by the great bravery as well as
di&s;cipline, of tho&s;e veteran Spaniards who &s;erved under that general. The
revolt of Holland and Zealand, provinces which the Prince of Orange formerly
com|manded, and where he was infinitely beloved, called him anew from his
retreat; and he added conduct, no le&s;s than &s;pirit, to that ob&s;tinate
re&s;i&s;tance, which was here made to the Spani&s;h dominion. By uniting the
revolted towns into a league, he laid the foundation of that illu&s;trious
commonwealth, the offspring of indu&s;try and liberty, who&s;e arms and policy
have made long &s;o &s;ignal a figure in every tran&s;action of Europe. He
inflamed the inhabitants by every motive, which religion, re&s;entment, or love
of freedom could in&s;pire. Tho' the pre|&s;ent greatne&s;s of the Spani&s;h
monarchy might deprive them of all courage, he &s;till flattered them with the
concurrence of the other provinces, and with a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from the
neighbouring &s;tates; and he exhorted them, in defence of their re|ligion,
their liberties, their lives, to endure the utmo&s;t extremities of war. From
this &s;pirit proceeded the de&s;perate defence of Harlem; a defence, which
nothing but the mo&s;t con&s;uming famine could overcome, and which the
Spaniards re|venged by the execution of more than two thou&s;and of the
inhabitants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bentivoglio, lib. 7.</NOTE>. This extreme
&s;everity, in&s;tead of &s;triking terror into the Hollanders, animated them
by de&s;pair; and the vigorous re&s;i&s;tance made at Alcmaer, where Alva was
finally repul&s;ed, &s;howed them that their in&s;olent enemies were not wholly
invincible. The duke, finding at la&s;t the pernicious effects of his violent
councils, &s;ollicited to be recalled from the government: Medina-celi, who was
appointed his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, refu&s;ed to accept the charge: Reque&s;ens,
commendator of Ca&s;tile, was &s;ent from Italy to replace Alva; and this
tyrant departed from the Netherlands in 1574; leaving his name in execration to
the inhabitants, and boa&s;ting in his <PB N="550" REF="153"> turn, that,
during the cour&s;e of five years government, he had delivered above eighteen
thou&s;and of the&s;e rebellious heretics into the hands of the
executioner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grotius, lib. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>REQUESENS, tho' a man of milder di&s;po&s;itions, could not
appea&s;e the violent hatred, which the revolted Hollanders had entertained
again&s;t the Spani&s;h govern|ment; and the war continued as ob&s;tinate as
ever. In the &s;iege of Leyden, un|dertaken by the Spaniards, the Dutch opened
the dykes and &s;luices, in order to drive them from that enterprize; and the
very pea&s;ants were active in ruining their fields by an inundation, rather
than fall again under the hated tyranny of Spain. But notwith&s;tanding this
repul&s;e, the governor &s;till pur&s;ued the war; and the conte&s;t &s;eemed
too unequal between &s;o mighty a monarchy, and two &s;mall provinces, however
fortified by nature, and however defended by the de&s;perate re&s;olution of
the inhabitants. The prince of Orange, therefore, in 1575, was re&s;olved to
&s;ue for foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to make applications to one or other of
his great neighbours, Henry or Elizabeth. The court of France was not exempt
from that &s;pirit of tyranny and per&s;ecution which prevailed with the
Spaniards; and that kingdom, torne by dome&s;tic di&s;&s;en&s;ions, &s;eemed
not to en|joy, at pre&s;ent, either leizure or ability to pay regard to foreign
intere&s;ts. But England, long connected both by commerce and alliance with the
Netherlands, and now more concerned in the fate of the revolted provinces by a
&s;ympathy in religion, &s;eemed naturally intere&s;ted in their defence; and
as Elizabeth had ju&s;tly entertained great jealou&s;y again&s;t Philip, and
governed her powerful and opulent kingdom in perfect tranquillity, great hopes
were entertained, that her policy, her ambition, or her genero&s;ity, would
engage her to &s;upport them under their pre&s;ent calamities. They &s;ent,
therefore, a &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y to London, con|&s;i&s;ting of St. Aldegonde,
Douza, Nivelle, Buys, and Mel&s;en; and after em|ploying the mo&s;t humble
&s;upplications to the Queen, they proferred her the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and
&s;overeignty of their provinces, if &s;he would employ her power in their
defence.</P>
<P>THERE were many &s;trong motives which might impel Elizabeth to
accept &s;o liberal an offer. She was apprized of the injuries which Philip had
done her, by his intrigues with the malecontents in England and Ireland<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 73.</NOTE>: She was di&s;plea&s;ed to
&s;ee a violent and military government e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ected in her neighbourhood: She fore&s;aw the danger which &s;he
&s;hould incur from a total prevalence of the catholics in the Low Countries:
And the maritime &s;ituation of tho&s;e provinces, as well as their command
over the great rivers, was a very inviting circum&s;tance to a nation like the
Engli&s;h, who were beginning to cultivate commerce and naval power. But 
<PB N="551" REF="154"> this prince&s;s, tho' magnanimous, had never entertained
the ambition of making conque&s;ts, or gaining new acqui&s;itions; and the
whole purpo&s;e of her vigilant and active politics, was to maintain, by the
mo&s;t frugal and cautious expedients, the tranquillity of her own dominions.
An open war with the Spani&s;h monarchy was the apparent con&s;equence of her
accepting the dominion of the&s;e provinces; and after taking the inhabitants
under her protection, &s;he could never afterwards in honour abandon them, but,
however de&s;perate their defence might become, &s;he mu&s;t embrace it, even
farther than her convenience or intere&s;t would per|mit. For the&s;e
rea&s;ons, &s;he refu&s;ed, in plain terms, the &s;overeignty profered her; but
told the amba&s;&s;adors, that, in return for the good-will which the prince of
Orange and the States had &s;hewn her, &s;he would endeavour to mediate an
agreement for them, on the mo&s;t rea&s;onable conditions which could be
obtained<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 453, 454.</NOTE>. She &s;ent
accordingly Sir Henry Cobham to Philip; and repre&s;ented to him, the danger
which the whole Low Countries, as well as the revolted provinces, would incur,
if France could obtain the lea&s;t interval from her inte&s;tine di&s;orders,
and find leizure to offer her protection to that mutinous and di&s;contented
people. Philip &s;eemed to take this remon&s;trance in good part; but no accord
en&s;ued, and the war continued with the &s;ame rage and violence as
before.</P>
<P>IT was an accident that delivered the Hollanders from their
pre&s;ent de&s;perate &s;ituation. Reque&s;ens, the governor, dying &s;uddenly,
the Spani&s;h troops, di&s;|contented for want of pay, and licentious for want
of a proper authority to com|mand them, broke out into a furious mutiny; and
threw every thing into confu|&s;ion. They &s;acked and pillaged the cities of
Mae&s;tricht and Antwerp, and com|mitted great &s;laughter on the inhabitants:
They threatned all the other cities with a like fate: And the whole provinces,
excepting Luxembourg, united for mu|tual defence again&s;t their violence, and
called in the prince of Orange and the Hol|landers, as their protectors. A
treaty, commonly called the Pacification of Ghent, was formed by common
agreement; where the removal of foreign troops, and the re&s;toration of their
ancient liberties, were the objects which the provinces &s;tipulated to
pur&s;ue. Don John of Au&s;tria, natural brother to Philip, being appointed
governor, found, on his arrival at Luxembourg, that the States had &s;o
fortified them&s;elves, and that the Spani&s;h troops were &s;o divided by
their &s;itua|tion, that there was no po&s;&s;ibility of re&s;i&s;tance; and he
agreed to the terms re|quired of him. The Spaniards were recalled; and the&s;e
provinces &s;eemed at la&s;t to breathe a little from their calamities.</P>
<P>BUT it was not ea&s;y for an entire peace to be &s;ettled, while
the thir&s;t of re|venge and dominion governed the King of Spain, and while the
Flemings were &s;o <PB N="552" REF="155"> &s;trongly agitated with re&s;entment
of pa&s;t, and fear of future injuries. The am|bition of Don John, who coveted
this great theatre for his military talents, en|gaged him rather to enflame
than appea&s;e the quarrel; and as he found the States determined to impo&s;e
very &s;trict limitations on his authority, he broke all arti|cles, &s;eized
Namur, and procured the recall of the Spani&s;h army from Italy. This prince,
endowed with a lofty genius, and animated by the pro&s;perous &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es
of his youth, had opened his mind to va&s;t undertakings; and looking much
beyond the conque&s;t of the revolted provinces, had projected to marry the
Queen of Scots, and to acquire in her right the dominion of the Briti&s;h
kingdoms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 466. Grotius, lib. iii.</NOTE>.
Elizabeth was aware of his intentions; and &s;eeing now, from the union of all
the provinces, a fair pro&s;pect of making a long and vigorous defence
again&s;t Spain, &s;he no longer &s;crupled to embrace the protection of their
liberties, which &s;eemed to be &s;o intimately connected with her own
&s;afety. After &s;ending them over a &s;um of money, about twenty thou&s;and
pounds, for the immediate pay of their troops, &s;he concluded a treaty with
them; in which &s;he &s;tipulated to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with five thou&s;and
foot and a thou&s;and hor&s;e, at the charge of the Flemings; and to lend them
a hundred thou&s;and pounds, on receiving the bonds of &s;ome of the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable towns of the Netherlands, for her re-payment within the year. It
was farther agreed, that the commander of the Engli&s;h army, &s;hould be
admitted into the council of the States; and nothing be deter|mined concerning
war or peace, without previou&s;ly informing the Queen or him of it; that they
&s;hould enter into no league without her con&s;ent; that if any di&s;cord
aro&s;e among them&s;elves, it &s;hould be referred to her arbitration; and
that, if any prince, on any pretext, &s;hould attempt ho&s;tilities again&s;t
her, they &s;hould &s;end to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance an army equal to that which
&s;he employed in their defence. This alliance was &s;igned on the 7th of
January, 1578<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 466&punc;</NOTE>. One
con&s;iderable in|ducement to the Queen for entering into treaty with the
States, was to prevent their throwing them&s;elves into the arms of France; and
&s;he was de&s;irous to make the King of Spain believe, that it was her &s;ole
motive. She repre&s;ented to him, by her amba&s;&s;ador, Thomas Wilkes, that
&s;he had hitherto acted religiou&s;ly the part of a good neighbour and ally;
had refu&s;ed the &s;overeignty of Holland and Zealand, when profered her; had
coun&s;elled the prince of Orange to &s;ub|mit to the King; and had even
accompanied her advice with menaces, in ca&s;e of his refu&s;al. She
per&s;evered, &s;he &s;aid, in the &s;ame friendly intentions; and, as a proof
of it, would venture to interpo&s;e with her advice for the compo&s;ure of the
pre&s;ent differences: Let Don John, whom &s;he could not but regard as her
mortal enemy, be recalled; let &s;ome other prince more popular be
&s;ub&s;ti|tuted in his place; let the Spani&s;h armies be withdrawn; let the
Flemings <PB N="553" REF="156"> be re&s;tored to their ancient liberties and
privileges: And if, after the&s;e conce&s;&s;i|ons, they are &s;till
ob&s;tinate not to return to their duty, &s;he promi&s;ed to join her arms to
tho&s;e of the King of Spain, and force them to a compliance. Philip
di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entment again&s;t the Queen; and &s;till continued to
&s;upply Don John with money and troops. That prince, tho' once repul&s;ed at
Rimenant, by the valour of the Engli&s;h under Norris, and tho' oppo&s;ed, as
well by the army of the States as by prince Ca&s;imir, who had conducted to the
Low Countries a great body of Germans, paid by the Queen, gained a great
advantage over the Flemings at Cemblours; but was cut off in the mid&s;t of his
pro&s;perity by poi|&s;on, given him &s;ecretly, as was &s;u&s;pected, by
orders from Philip, who dreaded his ambition. The prince of Parma &s;ucceeded
to the command, who uniting va|lour and clemency, negociation and military
exploits, made great progre&s;s again&s;t the revolted Flemings, and advanced
the progre&s;s of the Spaniards by his arts as well as by his arms.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e years, while Europe was almo&s;t every where in
great commo|tion, England enjoyed a profound tranquillity; owing chiefly to the
prudence and vigour of the Queen's admini&s;tration, and to the wi&s;e
precautions which &s;he employed in all her mea&s;ures. By &s;upporting the
zealous prote&s;tants in Scotland, &s;he had twice given them the &s;uperiority
over their antagoni&s;ts, had connected their intere&s;ts clo&s;ely with her
own, and had procured her&s;elf entire &s;ecurity from that quarter, whence the
mo&s;t dangerous inva&s;ions could be made upon her. She &s;aw in France her
enemies, the Gui&s;es, tho' extremely powerful, yet coun|terballanced by the
Hugonots, her zealous partizans; and even hated by the King, who was jealous of
their re&s;tle&s;s and exorbitant ambition. The bigotry of Philip gave her
ju&s;t ground of anxiety; but the &s;ame bigotry had happily excited the mo&s;t
ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition among his own &s;ubjects, and had created him enemies,
which his arms and policy were not likely &s;oon to overcome. The Queen of
Scots, her antagoni&s;t and rival, and the pretender to her throne, was a
pri&s;oner in her hands; and by her impatience and high &s;pirit had been
engaged in practices which afforded the Queen a pretence for rendring her
confinement more rigorous, and for cutting off her communication with her
partizans in England. Re|ligion was the capital point, on which depended all
the political tran&s;actions of that age; and the Queen's conduct in this
particular, making allowance for the prevail|ing prejudices of the age, could
&s;carcely be accu&s;ed of &s;everity or imprudence. She e&s;tabli&s;hed no
inqui&s;ition into men's bo&s;oms; &s;he impo&s;ed no oaths of &s;upre|macy,

the breach between the two religions as wide as po&s;&s;ible, and to make the
frequenting prote&s;tant churches appear highly criminal to the catholics<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham's Letter in Burnet, vol. II. 418.

to be actuated by a more unrea&s;onable ob|&s;tinacy, and to retain claims, of
which, both in civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, it was, as yet, difficult

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> THE mo&s;t memorable
event in this period was a &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, &s;um|moned on the 8th
of February, 1576, where debates were &s;tarted, which may appear &s;omewhat
curious and &s;ingular. Peter Wentworth, a puritan, who had &s;ignalized
him&s;elf former Parliaments, by his free and undaunted &s;pirit, opened this
&s;e&s;&s;ion with a premeditated harangue, which drew on him the indig|nation
of the hou&s;e, and gave great offence to the Queen and the courtiers. As it
&s;eems to contain the fir&s;t rude &s;ketch of tho&s;e principles of liberty
which hap|pily gained afterwards the a&s;cendant in England, it may not be
improper to give, in a few words, the &s;ub&s;tance of it. He premi&s;ed, that
the very name of liberty is &s;weet; but the thing it&s;elf is precious beyond
the mo&s;t ine&s;timable trea&s;ure: And that it behoved them to be careful,
le&s;t, contenting them&s;elves with the &s;weetne&s;s of the name, they forego
the &s;ub&s;tance, and abandon what of all earth|ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions was of
the highe&s;t value to the kingdom. He then proceeded to ob&s;erve, that
freedom of &s;peech in that hou&s;e, a privilege &s;o u&s;eful both to
&s;ove|reign and &s;ubject, had been formerly infringed in many e&s;&s;ential
articles, and was, at pre&s;ent, expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent danger: That
it was u&s;ual, when any &s;ubject of importance was handled, e&s;pecially if
it regarded religion, to &s;urmize, that the&s;e topics were di&s;agreeable to
the Queen, and that the farther proceeding in them would draw down her
indignation upon their temerity: That Solomon had ju&s;tly affirmed, the King's
di&s;plea&s;ure to be a me&s;&s;enger of death; and it was no wonder that men,
even tho' urged by motives of con&s;cience and duty, &s;hould be inclined to
&s;top &s;hort, when they found them&s;elves expo&s;ed to &s;o &s;evere a
penalty: That by employing this argument, the hou&s;e was incapacitated from
&s;erving their country, or even from &s;erving the Queen her&s;elf; who&s;e
ears, be&s;ieged by perni|cious flatterers, were thereby rendered
inacce&s;&s;ible to the mo&s;t &s;alutary truths: That it was a mockery to call
an a&s;&s;embly a Parliament, and yet deny them that privilege, which was &s;o
e&s;&s;ential to their being, and without which they mu&s;t de|generate into an
abject &s;chool of &s;ervitude and di&s;&s;imulation: That as the Parlia|ment
was the great guardian of the laws, they ought to have liberty to di&s;charge
their tru&s;t, and to maintain that authority whence even Kings them&s;elves
derive their being: That a King was con&s;tituted &s;uch by law, and tho' he
was not dependant on man, yet was he &s;ubordinate to God and the law, and was
obliged to make their pre&s;criptions, not his own will, the rule of his
conduct: That even his commi&s;&s;ion, as God's vicegerent, enforced, in&s;tead
of loo&s;ening, this obligation; &s;ince he was thereby inve&s;ted with
authority to execute on earth the will of God, <PB N="556" REF="159"> which is
nothing but law and ju&s;tice: That tho' the&s;e &s;urmizes of di&s;plea&s;ing
the Queen by their proceedings, had impeached, in a very e&s;&s;ential point,
all free|dom of &s;peech, a privilege granted them by a &s;pecial law; yet was
there a more expre&s;s and more dangerous inva&s;ion made on their liberties,
by frequent me&s;&s;ages from the throne: That it had become a practice, when
the hou&s;e were entering on any que&s;tion, either eccle&s;ia&s;tical or
civil, to bring an order from the Queen, prohibiting them ab&s;olutely to treat
of &s;uch matters, and barring them all farther di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the&s;e
momentuous articles: That the prelates, emboldened by her royal protection, had
a&s;&s;umed a deci&s;ive power in all que&s;tions of religion, and required
that every one &s;hould implicitly &s;ubmit his faith to their arbitrary
deter|minations: That the love which he bore his &s;overeign, forbad him to be
&s;ilent under &s;uch abu&s;es, or to &s;acrifice, on this important
occa&s;ion, his duty to &s;ervile flattery and complai&s;ance: And that, as no
earthly creature was exempt from fault, &s;o neither was the Queen her&s;elf;
but in impo&s;ing this &s;ervitude on her faithful commons, had committed a
great, and even dangerous, fault again&s;t her&s;elf and the whole realm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 236, 237, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, from this &s;peech, that in the&s;e
fir&s;t dawnings of liberty, the parliamentary &s;tile was &s;till crude and
unformed; and that the proper deco|rum of attacking mini&s;ters and
coun&s;ellors, without intere&s;ting the honour of the crown, or mentioning the
per&s;on of the &s;overeign, was not as yet entirely e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. The
commons expre&s;&s;ed great di&s;plea&s;ure at this unu&s;ual licence: They
&s;eque&s;tered Wentworth from the hou&s;e, and committed him pri&s;oner to the
&s;er|jeant at arms. They even ordered him to be examined by a committee,
con&s;i&s;t|ing of all tho&s;e members who were al&s;o members of the
privy-council, and a re|port to be made next day to the hou&s;e. This committee
met in the Star-cham|ber, and wearing the a&s;pect of that arbitrary court,
&s;ummoned Wentworth to appear before them, and an&s;wer for his behaviour. But
tho' the commons had di&s;covered &s;o little delicacy or precaution, in thus
confounding their own autho|rity with that of the Star-chamber; Wentworth
under&s;tood better the principles of liberty, and refu&s;ed to give the&s;e
coun&s;ellors any account of his conduct in Parliament, till he was &s;atisfied
that they acted not as members of the privy-coun|cil, but as a committee of the
hou&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 241.</NOTE>. He ju&s;tified
him&s;elf by pleading the rigour and hard&s;hip of the Queen's me&s;&s;ages;
and notwith&s;tanding that the committee &s;hewed him, by in&s;tances in other
reigns, that the practice of &s;ending &s;uch me&s;&s;ages was not
unprecedented, he would not agree to expre&s;s any &s;orrow or repentance. The
i&s;&s;ue of the affair was, that, after a month's confinement, the Queen
&s;ent to the com|mons, informing them, that, from her &s;pecial grace and
favour, &s;he had re&s;tored him <PB N="557" REF="160"> to his liberty and to
his place in the hou&s;e<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 244.</NOTE>.
By this &s;eeming lenity, &s;he indirectly retained the power which &s;he had
a&s;&s;umed, of impri&s;oning the members, and oblig|ing them to an&s;wer
before her for their conduct in Parliament. And Sir Walter Mildmay endeavoured
to make the hou&s;e &s;en&s;ible of her Maje&s;ty's goodne&s;s, in &s;o gently
remitting the indignation which &s;he might ju&s;tly conceive at the teme|rity
of their member: But he informed them, that they had not the liberty of
&s;peaking what and of whom they plea&s;ed; and that indi&s;creet freedoms
u&s;ed in that hou&s;e, had, both in the pre&s;ent and foregoing ages, met with
a proper pu|ni&s;hment. He warned them, therefore, not to abu&s;e farther the
Queen's cle|mency; le&s;t &s;he be con&s;trained, contrary to her inclination,
to turn an un&s;ucce&s;&s;|ful lenity into a nece&s;&s;ary &s;everity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 259.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE behaviour of the two hou&s;es was, in other re&s;pects,
equally tame and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive. In&s;tead of a bill, which was at fir&s;t
introduced<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 252.</NOTE>, for the
reforma|tion of the church, they were contented to pre&s;ent a petition to her
maje&s;ty for that purpo&s;e: And when &s;he told them, that &s;he would give
orders to her bi|&s;hops, to amend all abu&s;es, and if they were negligent,
&s;he would her&s;elf, by her &s;upreme power and authority over the church,
give &s;uch redre&s;s as would en|tirely &s;atisfy the nation; the Parliament
willingly acquie&s;ced in this &s;overeign and peremptory deci&s;ion<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 257.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' the commons &s;hewed &s;o little &s;pirit in oppo&s;ing the
authority of the crown, they maintained, this &s;e&s;&s;ion, their dignity
again&s;t an incroachment of the lords, and would not agree to a conference
which, they thought, was de&s;ired of them in an irregular manner. They
acknowleged, however, with all humble|ne&s;s, (&s;uch was their expre&s;&s;ion)
the &s;uperiority of the lords: They only refu&s;ed to give that hou&s;e any
rea&s;on for their proceedings; and a&s;&s;erted, that where they altered a
bill &s;ent them by the peers, it belonged to them to de&s;ire a conference,
not to the upper hou&s;e to require it<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
263.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE commons granted an aid of one &s;ub&s;idy and two
fifteenths. Mildmay, in order to &s;atisfy the hou&s;e concerning the
rea&s;onablene&s;s of this grant, entered into a detail of the Queen's pa&s;t
expences in &s;upporting the government, and of the increa&s;ing charges of the
crown, from the daily increa&s;e in the price of all com|modities. He did not,
however, forget to admoni&s;h them, that they were to re|gard this detail as
the pure effect of the Queen's conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;ince &s;he was not bound
to yield them any account how &s;he employed her trea&s;ure<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 246.</NOTE>.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE greate&s;t and mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;ecurity which Elizabeth
enjoyed during her whole reign, never exempted her from vigilance and
attention; but the &s;cene began now to be more overca&s;t, and danger
gradually multiplied on her from more than one quarter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch affairs.</NOTE> THE earl of Morton had
hitherto retained Scotland in &s;trict alliance with the Queen, and had al&s;o
re&s;tored dome&s;tic tranquillity: But it was not likely, that the factitious
and legal authority of a regent would long maintain it&s;elf in a country
unacquainted with law and order; where even the natural dominion of hereditary
princes &s;o often met with oppo&s;ition and controul. The nobility be|gan anew
to break into factions: The people were di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;ome in&s;tances
which appeared of Morton's avarice: And the clergy, who complained of far|ther
innovations on their narrow revenue, joined and increa&s;ed the di&s;content of
the other orders. The regent was &s;en&s;ible of his dangerous &s;ituation; and
hav|ing dropt &s;ome peevi&s;h expre&s;&s;ions, as if he were willing or
de&s;irous to re&s;ign the government, the noblemen of the oppo&s;ite party,
favourites of the young King, laid hold of this conce&s;&s;ion, and required
that demi&s;&s;ion which he &s;eemed &s;o frankly to offer them. James was at
this time but eleven years of age; yet Mor|ton, having &s;ecured him&s;elf, as
he imagined, by a general pardon, re&s;igned his authority into the hands of
the King, who pretended to conduct, in his own name, the admini&s;tration of
the kingdom. The regent retired from the govern|ment, and &s;eemed to employ
him&s;elf entirely in the care of his dome&s;tic affairs; but either tired with
this tranquillity, which appeared in&s;ipid after the agitations of ambition,
or thinking it time to throw off di&s;&s;imulation, he returned again to court,
acquired an a&s;cendant in the council; and tho' he re&s;umed not the title of
regent, governed with the &s;ame authority as before. The oppo&s;ite party,
after holding &s;eparate conventions, took to arms, under pretence of
delivering their <PB N="559" REF="162"> <MILESTONE N="1580" UNIT="year">
prince from captivity, and re&s;toring him to the free exerci&s;e of his
government: Queen Elizabeth interpo&s;ed by her amba&s;&s;ador, Sir Robert
Bowes, and mediated an agreement between the factions: Morton kept
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the government; but his enemies were numerous and
vigilant, and his authority &s;eemed to become every day more precarious.</P>
<P>THE count d'Aubigney, of the hou&s;e of Lenox, cou&s;in-german
to the King's father, had been born and educated in France; and being a young
nobleman of a good addre&s;s, and a &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition, he appeared to the
duke of Gui&s;e a very proper in&s;trument for detaching James from the
Engli&s;h intere&s;t, and connect|ing him with his mother and her relations. He
no &s;ooner appeared at Stir|ling, where James re&s;ided, than he acquired the
affections of the young monarch; and joining his intere&s;ts with James Stuart
of the hou&s;e of Ochiltree, a young man of profligate manners, who had
acquired the King's favour, he employed him&s;elf, under the appearance of play
and amu&s;ement, in in&s;tilling into the ten|der mind of the prince, new
&s;entiments of politics and government. He repre|&s;ented to him the
inju&s;tice which had been done Mary in her depo&s;ition, and made him
entertain thoughts, either of re&s;igning the crown into her hands, or of
a&s;&s;o|ciating her with him in the admini&s;tration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 412, 423. Melvil, p. 130.</NOTE>. Elizabeth, alarmed
with the dan|ger which might en&s;ue from the prevalence of this intere&s;t in
Scotland, &s;ent anew Sir Robert Bowes to Stirling; and accu&s;ing Aubigney,
now created earl of Le|nox, of an attachment to the French; warned James
again&s;t entertaining &s;uch &s;u&s;picious and dangerous connections<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 309.</NOTE>. The King excu&s;ed
him&s;elf, by Alexan|der Hume his amba&s;&s;ador; and Lenox, finding that the
Queen had openly de|clared again&s;t him, was farther confirmed in his
intention of overturning the Engli&s;h intere&s;t, and particularly of ruining
Morton, who was regarded as the head of it. That nobleman was arre&s;ted in
council, accu&s;ed as an accomplice in the late King's murder, committed to
pri&s;on, brought to trial, and condemned to &s;uffer as a traitor. He
confe&s;&s;ed, that Bothwel had communicated to him the de&s;ign, had pleaded
Mary's a&s;&s;ent, and had de&s;ired his concurrence; but he de|nied, that he
had ever given his approbation to that crime; and in excu&s;e for his
concealment, alledged the danger of revealing it, either to Henry, who had no
re&s;olution nor con&s;tancy, or to Mary, who appeared to be an accomplice in
the murder<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 31<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. Crawford, p. 333. Moy&s;e's Memoirs, p. 54.</NOTE>.
Sir Thomas Randolph was &s;ent by the Queen to intercede in favour of Morton;
and that amba&s;&s;ador, not content with di&s;charging this duty of his
function, engaged, by his per&s;ua&s;ion, the earls of Argyle, Montro&s;e,

protecting, even by force of arms, the life of the pri&s;oner. The more to
overawe that nobleman's enemies, Elizabeth ordered forces to be a&s;&s;embled
on the borders of England; but this expedient &s;erved only to ha&s;ten his
&s;entence and execution<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p.

attended him thro' all the various events of his life; and left a reputation,
which was le&s;s di&s;puted with regard to ability than probity and virtue. But
this conclu&s;ion of the &s;cene happened not till the &s;ub&s;equent year.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spani&s;h affairs.</NOTE> ELIZABETH was at
this time extremely anxious on account of every revolu|tion in Scotland;
becau&s;e that country alone, not being &s;eparated from England by &s;ea, and
bordering on all the catholic and malecontent counties, afforded her enemies a
&s;afe and ea&s;y method of attacking her; and becau&s;e &s;he was
&s;en&s;ible, that Mary, thinking her&s;elf abandoned by the French monarch,
had been en|gaged by the Gui&s;es to have recour&s;e to the powerful protection
of Philip, who, tho' he had not yet come to an open rupture with the Queen, was
every day, both by the injuries which he committed and received, more
exa&s;perated again&s;t her. That he might retaliate for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
which &s;he gave to his rebels in the Low Countries, he had &s;ent under the

fir&s;t Eng i&s;hman who compa&s;&s;ed the Globe; and the fir&s;t commander in
chief: For Magellan, who&s;e &s;hip executed the &s;ame adventure, died in his
pa&s;&s;age. His name became very celebrated on account of &s;o bold and
fortunate an attempt; but many, appre|hending the re&s;entment of the
Spaniards, endeavoured to per&s;uade the Queen, that it would be more prudent
to di&s;own the enterprize, to puni&s;h Drake, and to re&s;tore the trea&s;ure.
But Elizabeth, who admired valour, and who was allured by the pro&s;pect of
&s;haring in the riches, was determined to countenance that gallant &s;ailor:
She conferred on him the honour of knighthood, and accepted of a banquet from
him at Deptford, on board the &s;hip which had atchieved &s;o me|morable a
voyage. When Philip's amba&s;&s;ador, Mendoza, exclaimed again&s;t Drake's
pyracies, &s;he told him, that the Spaniards, by arrogating a right to the
whole new world, and excluding thence all other European nations, who &s;hould
&s;ail thither, even with a view of exerci&s;ing the mo&s;t lawful commerce,
very na|turally tempted others to make a violent irruption into the&s;e
countries<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 480.</NOTE>. To pacify,
however, the Spani&s;h monarch, &s;he cau&s;ed part of the booty to be
re|&s;tored to Pedro Sebura, a Spaniard, who pretended to be agent for the
merchants, whom Drake had &s;poiled. <MILESTONE N="1581" UNIT="year"> Having
learned afterwards, that Philip had &s;eized the money, and had employed part
of it again&s;t her&s;elf in Ireland, part of it in the pay of the prince of
Parma's troops, &s;he was determined to make no more re&s;titutions.</P>
<P>THERE was another cau&s;e, which induced the Queen to take this
re&s;olution: She was in &s;uch want of money, that &s;he was obliged to
a&s;&s;emble a Parliament; a mea&s;ure, which, as &s;he her&s;elf openly
declared, &s;he never embraced, ex|cept <PB N="562" REF="167"> when obliged by

<P>THE Queen and Parliament were engaged to pa&s;s the&s;e &s;evere
laws again&s;t the catholics, by &s;ome late di&s;coveries, which had been made
of the trea&s;onable practices of the Romi&s;h prie&s;ts. When the wor&s;hip of
the catholics was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the reformation introduced into the
univer&s;ities, the King of Spain reflected, that as &s;ome &s;pecies of
literature was requi&s;ite for the &s;upport of the&s;e doctrines and
controver&s;ies, the Romi&s;h communion mu&s;t totally decay in England, if no
means were found to give erudition to the eccle&s;ia&s;tics; and for this
rea&s;on, he founded a &s;eminary at Do&uuml;ay, where the catholics &s;ent
their children, chiefly tho&s;e intended for the prie&s;thood, in order to
receive the rudiments of their education. The cardinal of Lorraine imitated
this example by erecting a like &s;eminary in his dioce&s;e of Rheims; and tho'
Rome was &s;omewhat di&s;tant, the pope would not neglect to adorn, with a
foundation of the &s;ame nature, that capital of orthodoxy. The&s;e
&s;eminaries, founded with this ho&s;tile intention, &s;ent over every year a
colony of prie&s;ts, who maintained the catholic &s;uper&s;tition in the full
height of its bigotry; and being educated with a view to the crown of
martyrdom, were not deterred, either by danger or fatigue, from maintaining and
propagating their principles. They infu&s;ed into all their votaries an extreme
<PB N="563" REF="168"> hatred again&s;t the Queen; whom they treated as an
u&s;urper, a &s;chi&s;matic, a he|retic, a per&s;ecutor of the orthodox, and
one &s;olemnly and publickly anathema|tized by the holy father. Sedition,
rebellion, and even &s;ometimes a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, were the expedients, by
which they propo&s;ed to effectuate their purpo&s;es again&s;t her; and the
&s;evere re&s;traint, not to &s;ay per&s;ecution, under which the catholics
laboured, made them the more willingly receive, from their gho&s;tly fathers,
&s;uch violent doctrines.</P>
<P>THESE &s;eminaries were all of them under the direction of the
je&s;uits, a new order of regular prie&s;ts erected in Europe; when the court
of Rome perceived, that the lazy monks and beggarly friars, who &s;ufficed in
times of ignorance, were no longer able to defend the ramparts of the church,
a&s;&s;ailed on every &s;ide, and that the inqui&s;itive &s;pirit of the age
required a &s;ociety more active and more learned, to oppo&s;e its dangerous
progre&s;s. The&s;e men, as they &s;tood foremo&s;t in the conte&s;t again&s;t
the prote&s;tants, drew on them the extreme animo&s;ity of that whole &s;ect;
and by a&s;&s;uming a &s;uperiority over the other more numerous and more
antient orders of their own communion, were even expo&s;ed to the envy of their
brethren: So that it was no wonder, if the blame to which their principles and
conduct might be expo&s;ed, has, in many in&s;tances, been much exag|gerated.
This reproach, however, they mu&s;t bear from po&s;terity, that, by the very
nature of their in&s;titution, they were engaged to pervert learning, the only
effectual remedy again&s;t &s;uper&s;tition, into a nouri&s;hment of that
infirmity; and as their eru|dition was chiefly of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical and
&s;chola&s;tic kind (tho' a few members have cultivated polite literature) they
were only the more enabled, by that acqui&s;ition, to refine away the
plaine&s;t dictates of morality, and to erect a regular &s;y&s;tem of
ca&s;ui&s;try, by which prevarication, perjury, and every crime, where it
&s;erved their gho&s;tly purpo&s;es, might be ju&s;tified and defended.</P>
<P>THE je&s;uits, as devoted &s;ervants to the court of Rome,
exalted the preroga|tive of the &s;overeign pontiff above all earthly power;
and by maintaining his authority of depo&s;ing Kings, &s;et no bounds, either
to his &s;piritual or temporal juri&s;diction. This doctrine became &s;o
prevalent among the zealous catholics in England, that the excommunication,
fulminated again&s;t Elizabeth, excited many &s;cruples of a &s;ingular kind,
to which it behoved the holy father to provide a remedy. The bull of Pius, in
ab&s;olving the &s;ubjects from their oaths of allegi|ance, required them to
re&s;i&s;t the Queen's u&s;urpation; and many Romani&s;ts were apprehen&s;ive,
that, by this clau&s;e, they were obliged in con&s;cience, even tho' no
favourable opportunity offered, to rebel again&s;t her, and that no dangers nor
difficulties could free them from this indi&s;pen&s;ible duty. But Par&s;ons
and Cam|pian, two je&s;uits, were &s;ent over with a mitigation and explanation
of the doc|trine; <PB N="564" REF="169"> and they taught their votaries, that,
tho' the bull was for ever binding on Elizabeth and her partizans, it did not
oblige the catholics to obedience, except when the &s;overeign pontiff &s;hould
think proper, by a new &s;ummons, to require it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden,
p. 477.</NOTE>. Campian was afterwards detected in trea&s;onable practices; and
being put to the rack, and confe&s;&s;ing his guilt, he was publicly executed.
His execution was ordered at the very time, when the duke of Anjou was in
England, and pro&s;e|cuted with the greate&s;t appearance of &s;ucce&s;s his
marriage with the Queen; and this &s;everity was probably intended to appea&s;e
her prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, and to &s;atisfy them, that, whatever mea&s;ures
&s;he might pur&s;ue, &s;he never would depart from the principles of the
reformation.</P>
<P>WHILE ho&s;tilities were daily multiplying between Spain and
England, and while Elizabeth knew, that Philip, from re&s;entment, from
bigotry, and from intere&s;t, was &s;trongly, tho' &s;ecretly, induced to
effect her ruin, &s;he &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ecuring her&s;elf
again&s;t the efforts of &s;o powerful and political a monarch. The ob&s;tinate
re&s;i&s;tance of the &s;tates in the Netherlands gave her hopes, that his
force and trea&s;ure would be wa&s;ted in &s;ubduing the&s;e provinces; but the
admirable conduct and rapid progre&s;s of the prince of Parma &s;truck her with
apprehen&s;ions; and as the acqui&s;ition, which Philip, about this time, made
of Portugal, brought him a great acce&s;&s;ion of riches and naval power, the
expe|diency of &s;eeking the protection of &s;ome powerful alliance became
every day the more apparent. The animo&s;ity, which &s;till encrea&s;ed between
the French mo|narch and the duke of Gui&s;e, and the confederacy, which the
latter prince had &s;ecretly formed with Philip, opened the pro&s;pect of a
clo&s;e alliance between the &s;overeigns of France and England; and the
general apprehen&s;ions, entertained by all Europe of the Spani&s;h power,
&s;eemed to require &s;ome general union for re&s;i&s;t|ing its farther
progre&s;s.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotiations of marriage with the duke of
Anjou.</NOTE> THE duke of Alen&ccedil;on, now created duke of Anjou, had never
entirely dropped his preten&s;ions to e&s;pou&s;e Elizabeth; and that
prince&s;s, tho' her &s;uitor was near twenty-five years younger than
her&s;elf, and had no knowlege of her per&s;on but by pictures or
de&s;criptions, was &s;till plea&s;ed with the counterfeit image, which his
addre&s;&s;es afforded her of love and tenderne&s;s. The duke, in order to
forward his &s;uit, be&s;ides employing his brother's amba&s;&s;adors, &s;ent
over Simier, an agent of his own; an artful man, of an agreeable
conver&s;ation, who, &s;oon remarking the Queen's humour, amu&s;ed her with gay
di&s;cour&s;e, and in&s;tead of &s;erious political rea&s;onings, which, he
found, only awakened her ambition, and hurt his ma&s;ter's intere&s;ts,
introduced every moment all the topics of pa&s;&s;ion and <PB N="565" REF="170"> of gallantry. The plea&s;ure, which &s;he found in this man's
&s;ociety, &s;oon pro|duced a great familiarity between them; and amid&s;t the
greate&s;t hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s, her wi&s;e&s;t mini&s;ters had not &s;uch
ready acce&s;s to her per&s;on, as had Simier, who, under pretence of
negotiation, entertained her with accounts of the tender attach|ment borne her
by the duke of Anjou. The earl of Leice&s;ter, who had never before been
alarmed with any court&s;hip made to her, and who always tru&s;ted that her
love of dominion would prevail over her inclination to marriage, began to
apprehend, that &s;he was at la&s;t caught in her own &s;nare, and that the
artful encouragement, which &s;he had given to this young &s;uitor, had
unawares engaged her affections. To render Simier odious, he availed him&s;elf
of the credulity of the times, and &s;pread reports, that that mini&s;ter had
gained an a&s;cendant over the Queen, not by any natural principles of her
con&s;titution, but by incantations and love poti|ons. Simier, in revenge,
endeavoured to di&s;credit Leice&s;ter, and revealed to her a &s;ecret, which
none of her courtiers dared to di&s;cover, that this nobleman was &s;ecret|ly,
without her con&s;ent, married to the widow of the earl of E&s;&s;ex; an
action, which the Queen interpreted either to proceed from want of re&s;pect to
her, or as a violation of their mutual attachment; and which &s;o provoked her,
that &s;he threatened to &s;end him pri&s;oner to the Tower<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 471.</NOTE>. The quarrel went &s;o far between
Leice&s;ter and the French agent, that the former was &s;u&s;pected of having
em|ployed one Tudor, a bravo, to take away the life of his enemy; and the Queen
thought it nece&s;&s;ary, by proclamation, to put Simier under her own
protection. It happened, that while the Queen was rowed in her barge on the
Thames, at|tended by Simier, and &s;ome of her courtiers, a &s;hot was fired
which wounded one of her bargemen; but Elizabeth finding, upon enquiry, that
the piece had been di&s;charged by accident, gave the per&s;on his liberty,
without farther puni&s;hment. So far was &s;he from entertaining any &s;u&s;pic
on again&s;t her people, that &s;he was many times heard to &s;ay,

terms &s;he plea&s;ed, the articles were &s;oon &s;ettled with the Engli&s;h
commi&s;|&s;ioners. It was agreed, that the marriage &s;hould be celebrated
within &s;ix weeks after the ratification of the articles; that the duke and
his retinue &s;hould have the exerci&s;e of their religion; that after the
marriage he &s;hould bear the title of King, exerci&s;e of their religion; that
after the marriage he &s;hould bear the title of King, but the admini&s;tration
&s;hould remain &s;olely in the Queen; that their children, male or female,
&s;hould &s;ucceed to the crown of England; that if there be two males, the
elde&s;t, in ca&s;e of Henry's death without i&s;&s;ue, &s;hould be King of
France, the younger of England; that if there be but one male, and he &s;ucceed

to any office in England<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 484.</NOTE>.
The&s;e articles, providing for the &s;ecurity of England, in ca&s;e of its
annexation to the crown of France, opened but a di&s;mal pro&s;pect to the
Engli&s;h; had not the age of the Queen, who was now in her forty-ninth year,
contributed very much to allay their apprehen&s;ions of this nature. The Queen
al&s;o, as a proof of her &s;till remaining uncertainty, added a clau&s;e, that
&s;he was not bound to compleat the marriage, till farther articles, which are
not &s;pecified, &s;hall be agreed on between the parties, and till the King of
France be certified of their agreement. Soon after the Queen &s;ent over

with Henry, and enter into a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive again&s;t the
encrea&s;ing power and dan|gerous u&s;urpations of Spain. The French King, who
had been extremely di&s;|turbed with the unquiet &s;pirit, the re&s;tle&s;s
ambition, the enterprizing, and yet timid and incon&s;tant di&s;po&s;ition of
Anjou, had already &s;ought to free the kingdom from his intrigues, by opening
a &s;cene for his activity in Flanders; and having al|lowed him to embrace the
protection of the &s;tates, had &s;ecretly &s;upplied him with men and money
for that undertaking. The pro&s;pect of &s;ettling him in England was for a
like rea&s;on very agreeable to that monarch; and he was de|&s;irous to
cultivate, by every expedient, the favourable &s;entiments, which Eliza|beth
&s;eemed to entertain towards them. But this prince&s;s, tho' &s;he had gone
far|ther in her amorous dalliance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 387, 396,

and &s;he confined Wal&s;ingham, in his in&s;tructions, to the negotiating
con|ditions of a mutual alliance between France and England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 352.</NOTE>. Henry with reluc|tance &s;ubmitted to hold
conferences on that &s;ubject; but no &s;ooner had Wal&s;ing|ham begun to

<PB N="567" REF="172"> Queen, fore&s;eeing ho&s;tility with Spain to be the
re&s;ult of this confederacy, had declared, that &s;he would prefer the
marriage with the war, before the war with|out the marriage<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 375, 391.</NOTE>. The French court, plea&s;ed with this
change of re&s;olution, broke off the conferences concerning the league, and
opened a negotiation for the marriage<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
392.</NOTE>: But matters had not long proceeded in this train, before the Queen
again declared for the league in preference to the marriage, and ordered
Wal|&s;ingham to renew the conferences for that purpo&s;e. Before he had
leizure to bring this point to maturity, he was interrupted by a new change of
re&s;olution<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 408, 411.</NOTE>; and not
only the court of France, but Wal&s;ingham him&s;elf, Burleigh, and all the

terminate.</P>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of this affair, Elizabeth felt another variety
of intentions, from a new conte&s;t between her rea&s;on and her ruling
pa&s;&s;ions. The duke of Anjou ex|pected &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance of money, by
which he might be enabled to open the campaign in Flanders; and the Queen
her&s;elf, tho' her frugality made her long reluctant, was &s;en&s;ible that

&s;ucce&s;sful in rai&s;ing the &s;iege of Cambray; and being cho&s;en by the
&s;tates governor of the Netherlands, he put his army into winter quarters, and
came over to England, in order to pro&s;ecute his &s;uit to the Queen. The
reception, which he met with, made him promi&s;e him&s;elf entire &s;ucce&s;s,
and gave him hopes, that Elizabeth had &s;urmounted all her &s;cruples, and was
finally determined to make choice of him for her hu&s;band.

this ceremony, &s;he had given him a promi&s;e of marriage, and was even
de&s;irous of &s;ignifying her intention to all the world. St. Aldegonde,
amba&s;&s;ador from the &s;tates, di&s;patched immediately a letter to his
ma&s;ters, informing them of this great event; and the inhabitants of Antwerp,
who, as well as the other lemings, regarded the Queen as a kind of tutelar
divinity, te&s;tified their joy by bone&s;ires and the di&s;charge of their

that &s;he had originally u&s;urped the crown, or was now lawfully depo&s;ed by
the pope's bull of excommu|nication; and nothing had ever &s;o much elevated
their hopes as the pro&s;pect of her marriage with the duke of Anjou: That her
chief &s;ecurity at pre&s;ent again&s;t the efforts of &s;o numerous, rich, and
united a &s;action was, that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no head who could conduct
their dangerous enterprizes; and &s;he her&s;elf was ra&s;hly &s;upplying that
defect, by giving an intere&s;t in the kingdom to a prince, who&s;e education
had zealou&s;ly attached him to that communion: That tho' he was a &s;tranger
to the royal blood, the di&s;po&s;itions of men were now &s;uch, that they
preferred the religious to the civil connexions; and were more influenced by
the &s;ympathy of religion than by the principles of legal and hereditary
government: That the duke him&s;elf had di&s;covered a very re&s;tle&s;s and
turbulent &s;pirit; and having often violated his loyalty to his elder brother
and his &s;overeign, there re|mained no hopes that he would pa&s;&s;ively
&s;ubmit to a woman, whom he might think him&s;elf intitled, in quality of
hu&s;band, to command: That the French nation, &s;o populous, &s;o much
abounding in &s;oldiers, &s;o full of nobility, who were <PB N="569" REF="174">
devoted to arms, and, for &s;ome time, accu&s;tomed to &s;erve for plunder,
would &s;upply him with partizans, dangerous to a people, unwarlike and
defencele&s;s like the generality of her &s;ubjects: That the plain and
honourable path, which &s;he had followed, of cultivating the affections of her
people, had hitherto rendered her reign &s;ecure and happy; and however her
enemies might &s;eem to multiply upon her, the &s;ame invincible rampart was
&s;till able to protect and defend her: That &s;o long as the throne of France
was filled by Henry or his po&s;terity, it was vain to hope that the ties of
blood would en&s;ure the amity of that kingdom, preferably to the maxims of
policy or the prejudices of religion; and if ever the crown devolved to the
duke of Anjou, the conjunction of France and England would prove a burthen,
rather than a protection, to the latter kingdom: That the example of her
&s;i&s;ter Mary was &s;ufficient to in&s;truct her in the danger of &s;uch
connections; and to prove, that the affections and confidence of the Engli&s;h
could never be maintained, where they had &s;uch rea&s;on to apprehend that
their intere&s;ts would every moment be &s;acrificed to tho&s;e of a foreign
and ho&s;tile na|tion: That notwith&s;tanding the&s;e great inconveniencies,
di&s;covered by pa&s;t expe|rience, the hou&s;e of Burgundy, it mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed, was more popular in the nation than the family of France; and,
what was of chief moment, Philip was of the &s;ame communion with Mary, and was
connected with her by this great band of intere&s;t and affection: And that
however the Queen might remain child|le&s;s, even tho' old age &s;hould grow
upon her, the &s;ingular felicity and glory of her reign would pre&s;erve her
from contempt; the affections of her &s;ubjects, and tho&s;e of all the
prote&s;tants in Europe, would defend her from attacks; and her own prudence,
without other aid or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, would baffle all the efforts of her
mo&s;t malignant enemies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters of the Sydneys, vol.

<P>THESE reflections kept the Queen in great anxiety and
irre&s;olution; and &s;he was ob&s;erved to pa&s;s &s;everal nights without any
&s;leep or repo&s;e. At la&s;t her &s;et|tled habits of prudence and ambition
prevailed over her temporary inclination; and having &s;ent for the duke of
Anjou, &s;he had a long conver&s;ation with him in private, where &s;he was
&s;uppo&s;ed to have made him apologies for the breaking her former
engagements. He expre&s;&s;ed great di&s;gu&s;t on his departure; threw away
the ring which &s;he had given him; and uttered many cur&s;es on the mutability
of women, and of i&s;landers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 48<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. Soon after, he went over to
his government of the Netherlands; lo&s;t the confidence of the States, by a
ra&s;h and violent attempt on their liberties; was expelled that country;
retired into France; and there died. The Queen, by her timely reflection,
&s;aved her&s;elf from the numerous mi&s;chiefs which mu&s;t have attended &s;o
imprudent a marriage: And the pre&s;ent di&s;tracted <PB N="570" REF="175">

feeling any effects of that re&s;ent|ment which &s;he bad rea&s;on to dread

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch affairs.</NOTE> THE anxiety of the
Queen, from the attempts of the Engli&s;h catholics, never cea&s;ed during the
whole cour&s;e of her reign; but the variety of revolutions which happened in
all the neighbouring kingdoms, were the &s;ource &s;ometimes of her hopes,
&s;ometimes of her apprehen&s;ions. This year the affairs of Scotland
&s;trong|ly engaged her attention. The influence which the earl of Lenox, and
James Stuart, who now a&s;&s;umed the title of earl of Arran, had acquired over
the young King, was but a &s;lender foundation of authority; while the
generality of the nobles, and all the preachers, were &s;o much di&s;contented
with their admini&s;tra|tion. The a&s;&s;embly of the church appointed a
&s;olemn fa&s;t; of which one of the avowed rea&s;ons was the danger in which
the King &s;tood from the company of wicked per&s;ons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 319.</NOTE>: And on that day the pulpits
re&s;ounded with declamations again&s;t Lenox, Arran, and the King's pre&s;ent
coun&s;ellors. When the minds of the people were &s;ufficiently prepared by
the&s;e lectures, a con&s;piracy of the nobi|lity was formed, probably with the
concurrence of Elizabeth, for &s;eizing the per|&s;on of James at Ruthven, a
&s;eat of the earl of Gowry; and the de&s;ign, being kept very &s;ecret,
&s;ucceeded without any oppo&s;ition. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 Augu&s;t.</NOTE> The leaders in this
enter|prize were, the earl of Gowry him&s;elf, the earl of Marre, the lords
Linde&s;ey and Boyd, the ma&s;ters of Glamis and Oliphant, the abbots of
Dunfermline, Pai&s;ley, and Cambu&s;kenneth. The King wept when he found
him&s;elf detained a pri|&s;oner; but the ma&s;ter of Glamis &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"No matter for his tears: Better that boys
&s;hould weep than bearded men:"</Q> An expre&s;&s;ion which James could never

notwith&s;tanding his re&s;entment, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubmit to
the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity. He pretended an entire acquie&s;cence in the
con|duct of the a&s;&s;ociators; acknowleged the detention of his per&s;on to
be acceptable &s;ervice; and agreed, to &s;ummon both an a&s;&s;embly of the
church and a convention of e&s;tates, in order to ratify that enterprize. The
a&s;&s;embly, tho' they had e&s;tabli&s;h|ed it as an inviolable rule, that the
King, on no account, and on no occa&s;ion, &s;hould ever intermeddle in
eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, made no &s;cruple of taking civil affairs under
their cognizance, and of giving their verdict, that the attempt of the
con&s;pirators was acceptable to all that feared God, or tendered the
pre&s;erva|tion of the King's per&s;on, and pro&s;perous &s;tate of the realm.
They even enjoin|ed all the clergy to recommend the&s;e &s;entiments from the
pulpit; and they threat|ened with eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures every man who
&s;hould oppo&s;e the authority of the con&s;ederated lords<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 322.</NOTE>. The convention, being compo&s;ed chiefly of
the&s;e lords them|&s;elves, <PB N="571" REF="176"> added their &s;anction to
the&s;e proceedings. Arran was confined a pri&s;oner to his own hou&s;e: Lenox,
tho' he had power to re&s;i&s;t, yet rather than excite a civil war, or be the
cau&s;e of blood&s;hed<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Heylin's Hi&s;t.

he &s;oon after died. He per&s;evered to the la&s;t in his conver&s;ion to the
prote&s;tant reli|gion; which the Scotch clergy would never be per&s;uaded that
he had &s;incerely embraced. The King &s;ent for his family, re&s;tored his
&s;on to his paternal honours and e&s;tate, took care to e&s;tabli&s;h the
fortunes of all his other children; and to his la&s;t moments never forgot the
early friend&s;hip which he had borne their father: A &s;trong proof of the

<P>NO &s;ooner was this revolution known in England, than the Queen
&s;ent Sir Henry Cary, and Sir Robert Bowes to James, in order to congratulate
him on his deliverance from the pernicious coun&s;els of Lenox and Arran; to
exhort him not to re&s;ent the &s;eeming violence of the lords' enterprize; and
to procure from him permi&s;&s;ion for the return of the earl of Angus, who,
ever &s;ince Morton's fall, had lived in England. They ea&s;ily prevailed in
the la&s;t application; and as James &s;u&s;pected, that Elizabeth had not been
entirely unacquainted with the project of his detention, he thought proper,
before the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, to di&s;&s;emble his re&s;entment
again&s;t the confederated noblemen. Soon after La Mothe-Fenelon, and
Menneville, appeared as amba&s;&s;adors from France:
<MILESTONE N="1583" UNIT="year"> Their errand was to enquire concerning the
&s;ituation of the King, make profe&s;&s;ions of their ma&s;ter's friend&s;hip,
confirm the ancient league with France, and procure an ac|commodation between
him and the Queen of Scots. This la&s;t propo&s;al gave great umbrage to the
clergy; and the a&s;&s;embly had already voted, the &s;ettling of terms between
the mother and &s;on, to be a mo&s;t wicked undertaking. The pul|pits
re&s;ounded with declamations again&s;t the French amba&s;&s;adors;
particularly Fene|lon, whom they called the Me&s;&s;enger of the bloody
murderer, meaning the duke of Gui&s;e: And as that mini&s;ter, being knight of
the Holy Gho&s;t, wore a white cro&s;s on his &s;houlder, they commonly
denominated it in contempt, the badge of Antichri&s;t. The King endeavoured,
tho' in vain, to repre&s;s the&s;e in&s;olencies; but in order to make the
amba&s;&s;adors &s;ome compen&s;ation, he de&s;ired the magi&s;trates of
Edinburgh to give them a &s;plendid dinner before their departure. To prevent
this entertainment, the clergy appointed that very day for a public fa&s;t; and
finding that their orders were not regarded, they employed their whole
&s;ermons in thundering cur&s;es on the magi&s;trates, who, by the King's
direction, had put this mark of re&s;pect on the amba&s;&s;adors. They even
pur&s;ued them afterwards with the cen&s;ures of the church; and it was with
difficulty they prevented from <PB N="572" REF="177"> pa&s;&s;ing the
&s;entence of excommunication again&s;t them, on account of their
&s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to royal, preferably to clerical, authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 324.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT increa&s;ed the alarm with regard to an accommodation
between James and Mary, was, that the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors &s;eemed to
concur with the French in this propo&s;al; and the clergy were &s;o ignorant as
to credit the &s;incerity of the profe&s;&s;ions made by the former. The Queen
of Scots had often made overtures to Elizabeth, which had been entirely
neglected; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter of Queen Mary to Elizabeth.</NOTE> but
hearing of James's deten|tion, &s;he wrote a letter in a more pathetic and more
&s;pirited &s;train than u&s;ual; craving the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that
prince&s;s, both for her own and her &s;on's liberty. She &s;aid, that the
account of the prince's captivity had excited her mo&s;t tender concern; and
the experience which &s;he her&s;elf, during &s;o many years, had of the
extreme infelicity attending that &s;ituation, had made her the more
apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t a like fate &s;hould her unhappy offspring: That the
long train of in|ju&s;tice which &s;he had &s;uffered; the calumnies to which
&s;he had been expo&s;ed; were &s;o grievous, that, finding no place for right
or truth among men, &s;he was reduced to make her la&s;t appeal to heaven, the
only competent tribunal between princes of equal juri&s;diction, degree, and
dignity: That after her rebellious &s;ub|jects, &s;ecretly in&s;tigated by
Elizabeth's mini&s;ters, had expelled her from the throne, had confined her to
pri&s;on, had pur&s;ued her with arms, &s;he had voluntarily thrown her&s;elf
under the protection of England, fatally allured by tho&s;e reiter|ated
profe&s;&s;ions of amity which had been made her, and by her confidence in the
genero&s;ity of a friend, an ally, and a kin&s;woman: That not contented with
de|barring her from her pre&s;ence, with &s;upporting the u&s;urpers of her
throne, with contributing to the de&s;truction of her faithful &s;ubjects,
Elizabeth had reduced her to a wor&s;e captivity than that from which &s;he had
e&s;caped, and had made her this cruel return for the unlimited tru&s;t which
&s;he had repo&s;ed in her: That tho' her re&s;entment of &s;uch &s;evere
u&s;age had never carried her farther than to u&s;e &s;ome di&s;appointed
efforts for her deliverance, unhappy to her&s;elf, and fatal to others, &s;he
found the rigours of confinement daily multiplied upon her; and at length
carried to &s;uch a height as &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the bounds of all human patience
any longer to endure them: That &s;he was cut off from all communication, not
only with the re&s;t of mankind, but al&s;o with her only &s;on; and her
maternal fondne&s;s, which was now more enlivened by their unhappy &s;ympathy
in &s;ituation, and was her &s;ole remaining attachment to the world, deprived
even of that melancholy &s;olace, which letters or me&s;&s;ages could give:
That the bitterne&s;s of her &s;orrows, &s;till more than her clo&s;e
con&s;inement, had preyed upon her health, and had added the in&s;ufferable
weight of bodily infirmity to all tho&s;e other calamities under which 
<PB N="573" REF="178"> &s;he laboured: That while the daily experience of her
maladies opened to her the comfortable pro&s;pect of an approaching deliverance
into a region where pain and &s;orrow are no more, her enemies envied her that
la&s;t con&s;olation; and having &s;e|cluded her from every joy on earth, had
done what in them lay to debar her from all hopes in her future and eternal
exi&s;tence: That the exerci&s;e of her religion was refu&s;ed her; the u&s;age
of tho&s;e rites in which &s;he had been educated; the commerce with tho&s;e
holy mini&s;ters, whom heaven had appointed to receive the acknowlegement of
our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and to &s;eal our penitence by a &s;olemn
re-admi&s;&s;ion into heavenly favour and forgivene&s;s: That it was in vain to
com|plain of the rigours of per&s;ecution exerci&s;ed in other kingdoms; when a
Queen, and an innocent woman, was excluded from an indulgence which never yet,
in the mo&s;t barbarous countries, had been denied to the meane&s;t and mo&s;t
criminal malefactor: That could &s;he ever be induced to de&s;cend from that
royal dignity in which Providence had placed her, or depart from her appeal to
Heaven, there was only one other tribunal to which &s;he would appeal from all
her enemies; to the ju&s;tice and humanity of Elizabeth's own brea&s;t, and to
that lenity, which, uninfluenced by malignant coun&s;el, &s;he would naturally
be induced to exerci&s;e to|wards her: And that &s;he finally intreated her, to
re&s;ume her natural di&s;po&s;ition, and to reflect on the &s;upport, as well
as comfort, which &s;he might receive from her &s;on and her&s;elf, if, joining
the obligations of gratitude to the ties of blood, &s;he would deign to rai&s;e
them from their pre&s;ent melancholy &s;ituation, and re|in&s;tate them in that
liberty and authority to which they were entitled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was chiefly induced to ob&s;truct Mary's
re&s;toration, becau&s;e &s;he fore&s;aw an unhappy alternative attending that
event. If this prince&s;s recovered any con&s;iderable &s;hare of authority in
Scotland, her re&s;entment, ambition, zeal, and connections, both dome&s;tic
and foreign, might render her a dangerous neigh|bour to England, and enable
her, after &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Engli&s;h party among her &s;ubjects, to
revive tho&s;e preten&s;ions which &s;he had formerly advanced to the crown,
and which her partizans in both kingdoms &s;till &s;upported with great
in|du&s;try and a&s;&s;urance. If &s;he was rein&s;tated in power, with &s;uch
&s;trict limitations as could not be broken, &s;he might be di&s;gu&s;ted with
her &s;ituation; and flying abroad, form more de&s;perate attempts than any
&s;overeign, who had a crown to hazard, would willingly undertake. Mary
her&s;elf, &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e difficulties, and convinced by experience,
that Elizabeth would for ever debar her the throne, was now become more humble
in her wi&s;hes; and as age and infirmities had repre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e
&s;entiments of ambition and indignation, by which &s;he was former|ly &s;o
much agitated, &s;he was willing to &s;acrifice all her hopes of power and 
<PB N="574" REF="179"> grandeur, in order to obtain a little more liberty; a
ble&s;&s;ing to which &s;he very naturally a&s;pired with the fonde&s;t
impatience. She propo&s;ed, therefore, that &s;he &s;hould be a&s;&s;ociated
with her &s;on in the title to the crown of Scotland, but that the
admini&s;tration &s;hould remain &s;olely in him: And &s;he was contented to
live in England, in a private &s;tation, and even in a kind of re&s;traint; but
with &s;ome more liberty, both for exerci&s;e and company, than &s;he had
enjoyed &s;ince the fir&s;t di&s;covery of her intrigues with the duke of
Norfolk. But Elizabeth, who was afraid le&s;t &s;uch a loo&s;e method of
guarding her, would facilitate her e&s;cape into France or Spain, or, at
lea&s;t, would encourage and increa&s;e her partizans, and enable her to
conduct tho&s;e intrigues to which &s;he had already di&s;covered &s;o &s;trong
a propen&s;ity, was &s;ecretly determined to deny her reque&s;ts; and tho'
&s;he feigned to a&s;&s;ent to them, &s;he well knew how to di&s;appoint the
expectations of the unhap|py prince&s;s. While Lenox maintained his authority
in Scotland, &s;he never gave any reply to all the applications made her by the
Scotti&s;h Queen<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 540.</NOTE>:
At pre&s;ent, when her own creatures had acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
government, &s;he was re|&s;olved to throw the odium of the refu&s;al upon
them; and pretending, that no|thing was required to a perfect accommodation,
but the concurrence of the coun|cil of &s;tate of Scotland, &s;he ordered her
amba&s;&s;ador, Bowes, to open the nego|ciation for Mary's liberty, and her
a&s;&s;ociation with her &s;on in the title to the crown. Tho' &s;he &s;eemed
to make this conce&s;&s;ion to Mary, &s;he refu&s;ed her the liberty of
&s;ending any amba&s;&s;ador of her own; and that prince&s;s could ea&s;ily
conjecture, from this circum&s;tance, what would be the i&s;&s;ue of the
pretended ne|gociation. The Scotch council, in&s;tigated by the clergy,
rejected all treaty; and James, who was now a captive in their hands, affirmed,
that he had never a&s;&s;ented to an a&s;&s;ociation with his mother, and that
the matter had never gone farther than &s;ome loo&s;e propo&s;als for that
purpo&s;e<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">MS. in the Advocate's library, A. 3.

<P>THE affairs of Scotland remained not long on the pre&s;ent
footing. James, impatient of re&s;traint, made his e&s;cape from his keepers;
and flying to St. An|drews, &s;ummoned his friends and partizans to attend him.
The earls of Argyle, Mar&s;hal, Montro&s;e, and Rothes, ha&s;tened to pay their
duty to their &s;overeign; and the oppo&s;ite party found them&s;elves unable
to re&s;i&s;t &s;o powerful a combina|tion. They were offered a pardon, upon
their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and an acknowlege|ment of their fault, in &s;eizing the
King's per&s;on, and re&s;training him from his liberty. Some of them accepted
of the terms: The greater number, particu|larly Angus, Hamilton, Marre, Glamis,
left the country; and took &s;helter in <PB N="575" REF="180"> Ireland or
England, where they were protected by Elizabeth. The earl of Arran was recalled
to court; and the malecontents, who could not brook the authority of Lenox, a
man of virtue and moderation, found, that, by their re&s;i&s;tance, they had
thrown all the power into the hands of a per&s;on who&s;e councils were as

<P>ELIZABETH wrote a letter to James; where &s;he quoted a moral

mea&s;ures; and turned two pa&s;|&s;ages of I&s;ocrates again&s;t her, for one

learn, from a man of &s;o much penetration and di&s;cernment, the real
character and capacity of James. This young prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed very good

re|quired; and as he excelled in general di&s;cour&s;e and conver&s;ation,

account which he gave his mi&s;tre&s;s, induced her to treat him thenceforth
with &s;ome more regard than &s;he had hitherto been inclined to pay him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1584" UNIT="year"> THE King of Scots,
per&s;evering in his pre&s;ent views, &s;ummoned a Parliament; where it was
enacted, that no clergyman &s;hould pre&s;ume, in his &s;ermons, to utter
fal&s;e, untrue, or &s;candalous &s;ayings again&s;t the King, the council, or

gro&s;s libertines, belly gods, and infamous per&s;ons<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 334.</NOTE>. The violent conduct of Arran
&s;oon brought over the popularity to their &s;ide. The earl of Gowry, tho'
pardoned for the late at|tempt, was committed to pri&s;on, was tried on &s;ome
new accu&s;ations, condemned, and executed. Many innocent per&s;ons &s;uffered
from the tyranny of this favou|rite; and the bani&s;hed lords, being

revolutions in Scotland would have been regarded as of &s;mall import|ance to
the repo&s;e and &s;ecurity of Elizabeth, had her own &s;ubjects been entirely
united, and had not the zeal of the catholics, excited by con&s;traint, more
pro|perly than per&s;ecution, daily threatened her with &s;ome dangerous
in&s;urrection. The vigilance of the mini&s;ters, particularly of Burleigh and
Wal&s;ingham, was rai&s;ed in proportion to the activity of the malecontents;
and many arts, which had been blameable in a more peaceable government, were
employed to detect con|&s;piracies, and even di&s;cover the &s;ecret
inclinations of men. Counterfeit letters were wrote in the name of the Queen of
Scots, or of the Engli&s;h exiles, and privately conveyed to the hou&s;es of
the catholics: Spies were hired to ob&s;erve the actions and di&s;cour&s;e of
&s;u&s;pected per&s;ons: Informers were countenanced: And tho' the &s;agacity
of the&s;e two great mini&s;ters helped them to di&s;tingui&s;h the true from
the fal&s;e intelligence, many calumnies were, no doubt, hearkened to, and all
the &s;ubjects, particularly the catholics, kept in the utmo&s;t anxiety and
in|quietude. Henry Piercy, earl of Northumberland, brother to the earl
be|headed &s;ome years before, and Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, &s;on to the
un|fortunate duke of Norfolk, fell under &s;u&s;picion; and the latter was, by
order of the council, confined to his own hou&s;e. Francis Throcmorton, a
private gentle|man, was committed to cu&s;tody, on account of a letter which he
had wrote to the Queen of Scots, and which was intercepted. Lord Pager, and
Charles Arundel, who had been engaged with him in trea&s;onable de&s;igns,
immediately withdrew beyond &s;ea. Throcmorton confe&s;&s;ed, that a plan for
an inva&s;ion and in&s;urrection had been laid; and tho', on his trial, he was
de&s;irous of retracting this confe&s;&s;ion, and imputing it to the fear of
torture, he was found guilty and executed. Men|doza, the Spani&s;h
amba&s;&s;ador, having promoted this con&s;piracy, was ordered to depart the
kingdom; and Wade was &s;ent into Spain, to excu&s;e his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and
to de&s;ire the King to &s;end another amba&s;&s;ador in his place: But Philip

honour, but inflexible and rigid in their care and attention. An

the more zealous catholics, men of all ranks willingly flocked to the

<P>THE Parliament, be&s;ides arming the Queen with the&s;e powers,
granted her a &s;upply of one &s;ub&s;idy and two fifteenths. The only
circum&s;tance, in which their proceedings were di&s;agreeable to her, was an
application, which the commons made for a farther reformation in
eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters. Yet even in this attempt, which affected her, as
well as them, in a very delicate point, they di&s;covered how much they were
overawed by her authority. The majority of the hou&s;e were puritans, or
inclined to that &s;ect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides the petition
after-mentioned, another proof of the prevalency of the puritans among the

amu&s;ements, which they were accu&s;tomed to take on that day. D'Ewes, p. 335.
It was a &s;trong &s;ymptom of a contrary &s;pirit in the upper hou&s;e, that
they propo&s;ed to add Wedne&s;day to the fa&s;t days, and to prohibit entirely

&s;evere reprimands, which they had already, in former &s;e&s;&s;ions, met with
from the throne, deterred them from introducing any bill concerning religion; a
proceeding which would have been interpreted as an incroachment on the royal
prerogative: They were contented to proceed by way of humble petition, and that
not to her maje&s;ty, which would certainly have given &s;ome offence, but to
the hou&s;e of lords, or rather to the bi&s;hops, who had a &s;eat in that

receive all advances towards reformation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p.

<P>THE commons de&s;ired in their humble petition, that no bi&s;hop
&s;hould exerci&s;e his function of ordination but with the con&s;ent and
concurrence of &s;ix pre&s;byters: A demand, which as it would have introduced
a change of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, was firmly rejected by the prelates.
They de&s;ired, that no clergyman &s;hould be in&s;tituted into any benefice,
without previous warning being given to the pari&s;h, that they might examine
whether there lay any objection to his life or doctrine: But this attempt
towards a popular model naturally met with the &s;ame fate. In another article
of the petition, they prayed, that the bi&s;hops &s;hould not in&s;i&s;t upon
every ceremony, or deprive incumbents for omitting a part of the &s;ervice: As
if uniformity in public wor&s;hip had not been e&s;tabli&s;hed by law; or as if
the prelates had been endowed with a di&s;pen&s;ing power. They complained of
abu&s;es, which prevailed, in denouncing the &s;entence of excommunication, and
entreated the reverend fathers to think of &s;ome law for the remedy of the&s;e
abu&s;es: Im|plying, that tho&s;e matters were too high for the commons of
them&s;elves to meddle with them.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t material article, which the commons touched upon
in their pe|tition, was the eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion, and the oath
<HI>ex officio,</HI> as it was called, exacted by that court. This is a
&s;ubject of &s;uch importance, as to merit &s;ome explanation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The eccle&s;ia&s;|tical court.</NOTE> THE
fir&s;t primate after the Queen's acce&s;&s;ion, was Parker; a man rigid in
ex|acting conformity to the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip, and in puni&s;hing by
fines or depri|vations, all the puritans, who attempted to innovate any thing
in the habits, ceremonies, or liturgy of the church. He died in 1575; and was
&s;ucceeded by Grindal, who, as he him&s;elf inclined to the new &s;ect, was
with great difficulty brought to execute the law again&s;t them, or to puni&s;h
the nonconforming clergy. He declined obeying the Queen's orders for the
&s;uppre&s;&s;ion of <HI>prophecyings,</HI> which, &s;he apprehended, had
become &s;o many academies of fanatici&s;m; and for this offence, &s;he had, by
an order of the Star Chamber, &s;eque&s;tered him from his archiepi&s;copal
function, and confined him to his own hou&s;e. Upon his death, which happened
in 1583, &s;he was determined not to fall into the &s;ame error in her next
choice; and &s;he named Whitgift, a zealous churchman, who had al|ready
&s;ignalized his pen in controver&s;y, and who, having in vain attempted to
convince the puritans by argument, was now determined to open their eyes by
power, and by the execution of penal &s;tatutes. He informed the Queen, that
all the &s;piritual authority lodged in the prelates was vain without the
&s;anction of the <PB N="580" REF="185"> crown; and as there was no
eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion at that time in force, he engaged her to
i&s;&s;ue a new one; more arbitrary than any of the former, and conveying more
unlimited authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neal's Hi&s;tory of the Puritans,
vol. I. p. 410.</NOTE>. She appointed forty-four commi&s;&s;ioners, twelve of
whom were eccle&s;ia&s;tics; three commi&s;&s;ioners could exerci&s;e the whole
power of the court; their juri&s;diction extended over the whole kingdom, and
over all orders of men; and every circum&s;tance of their authority, and all
their methods of proceeding, were contrary to the cleare&s;t principles of law
and na|tural equity. They were empowered to vi&s;it and reform all errors,
here&s;ies, &s;chi&s;ms, in a word, to regulate all opinions, as well as to
puni&s;h all breach of uniformity in the exerci&s;e of public wor&s;hip. They
were directed to make en|quiry, not only by the legal methods of juries and
witne&s;&s;es, but by all other means and ways, which they could devi&s;e; that
is, by the rack, by torture, by inqui&s;ition, by impri&s;onment. Where they
thought proper to &s;u&s;pect any per&s;on, they might admini&s;ter to him an
oath, called <HI>ex officio,</HI> by which he was bound to an&s;wer all
que&s;tions, and might thereby be obliged to accu&s;e him&s;elf or his mo&s;t
intimate friend. The fines, which they impo&s;ed, were merely di&s;cretionary,
and often occa&s;ioned the total ruin of the offenders, con|trary to the
e&s;tabli&s;hed law of the kingdom. The impri&s;onment, to which they condemned
any delinquent, was limited by no rule but their own plea|&s;ure. They
a&s;&s;umed a power of impo&s;ing on the clergy what new articles of
&s;ub&s;cription, and con&s;equently of faith, they thought proper. Tho' all
other &s;piritual courts were &s;ubject, &s;ince the reformation, to
inhibitions from the &s;u|preme courts of law, the eccle&s;ia&s;tical
commi&s;&s;ioners exempted them&s;elves from that legal juri&s;diction, and
were liable to no controul. And the more to enlarge their authority, they were
empowered to puni&s;h all ince&s;ts, adulteries, fornica|tions; all outrages,
mi&s;behaviours, and di&s;orders in marriage: And the puni&s;h|ments, which
they might inflict, were according to their wi&s;dom, con&s;cience, and
di&s;cretion. In a word, this court was a real <HI>inqui&s;ition;</HI> attended
with all the iniquities, as well as cruelties, in&s;eparable from that horrid
tribunal. And as the juri&s;diction of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court was
de&s;tructive of all law, &s;o its erection was deemed by many a mere
u&s;urpation of this imperious prince&s;s, and had no other foundation than a
clau&s;e of a &s;tatute, re&s;toring the &s;upremacy to the crown, and
empowering the &s;overeign to appoint commi&s;&s;ioners for exerci&s;ing that
pre|rogative. But prerogative in general, and e&s;pecially the &s;upremacy,
were &s;up|po&s;ed in that age to involve powers, which no law, precedent, or

pre&s;umption, and reproving them for tho&s;e murmurs, which, for fear of
offend|ing her, they had pronounced &s;o low as not directly to reach her royal

innovations, &s;he would no longer endure this licence; but meant to guide her
people, by God's rule, in the ju&s;t mean between the corruptions of Rome and
the errors of mo|dern &s;ectaries: And that as the Romani&s;ts were the
inveterate enemies of her per&s;on, &s;o the other innovators were dangerous to

e&s;tabli&s;hed in the mid&s;t of the church, notwith&s;tanding the rigour of

<P><PB N="582" REF="187"> DURING this &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament,
there was di&s;covered a con&s;piracy, which much encrea&s;ed the natural
animo&s;ity again&s;t the catholics, and &s;till farther widened the breach
between the religious parties. William Parry, a catholic gentleman, had
received the Queen's pardon for a crime, by which he was ex|po&s;ed to capital
puni&s;hment; and having got permi&s;&s;ion to travel, he retired to Milan, and
made open profe&s;&s;ion of his religion, which he had concealed while he
remained in England. He was here per&s;uaded by Palmio, a je&s;uit, that he
could not perform a more meritorious action, than to take away the life of his
&s;overeign and his benefactre&s;s; the nuncio, Campeggio, when con&s;ulted,
approved extremely of this pious undertaking; and Parry, tho' &s;till agitated
with doubts, came to Paris, with an intention of pa&s;&s;ing over to England,
and executing his bloody purpo&s;e. He was here encouraged in the de&s;ign by
Thomas Morgan, a gentleman of great credit in the party; and tho' Watts and
&s;ome other catholic prie&s;ts told him, that the enterprize was criminal and
impious, he preferred the authority of Raggazzoni, the pope's nuncio at Paris,
and was determined to per&s;i&s;t in his re&s;olution. He here wrote a letter
to the pope, which was conveyed to cardinal Como; communicated his intention to
the holy father; and craved his ab&s;olution and paternal benediction. He
received an an&s;wer from the cardi|nal, by which he perceived that his
purpo&s;e was extremely applauded; and he came over to England with a full
de&s;ign of carrying it into execution. So deeply are the &s;entiments of
morality engraved in mens brea&s;ts, that it is very difficult even for the
prejudices of fal&s;e religion totally to efface them; and this bigotted
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in re&s;olved, before he came to extremity, to try every other
expedient for alleviating the per&s;ecutions, under which the catholics at that
time laboured. He found means of being introduced to the Queen; a&s;&s;ured her
that many con&s;pira|cies were formed again&s;t her; and exhorted her, as the
only means of &s;aving her life, to give the Romani&s;ts &s;ome more indulgence
in the exerci&s;e of their religion: But le&s;t he &s;hould be tempted by the
opportunity to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate her, he always came to court unprovided of
every offen&s;ive weapon. He even procured him&s;elf to be elected member of
Parliament; and having made a vehement &s;peech again&s;t the &s;evere laws
enacted this la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, was committed to cu&s;tody for his freedom,
and &s;eque&s;tred from the hou&s;e. His failure in the&s;e attempts confirmed
him the more in his former re&s;olution, and he communicated his intentions to
Nevil, who entered zealou&s;ly into the de&s;ign, and was determined to have a
&s;hare in the merits of its execution. A book, newly publi&s;hed by Dr. Allen,
afterwards created a cardinal, &s;erved farther to efface all their &s;cruples,
with regard to the murder of a heretical prince; and having agreed to &s;hoot
the Queen as &s;he was riding on hor&s;eback, they re&s;olved, if they could
not make their e&s;cape, to &s;acrifice their <PB N="583" REF="188"> lives in
fulfilling a duty, &s;o agreeable, as they imagined, to the will of God, and to
true religion. But while they were watching an opportunity for the exe|cution
of their purpo&s;e, the earl of We&s;tmoreland happened to die in exile; and as
Nevil was next heir to that family, he began to entertain hopes, that, by doing
an acceptable &s;ervice to the Queen, he might recover the e&s;tate and
ho|nours which had been forfeited by the rebellion of the la&s;t earl.

death. He &s;hot him&s;elf into the brea&s;t with a pi&s;tol. About the &s;ame
time, the earl of Arundel, &s;on to the unfortunate duke of Norfolk, having
entered into &s;ome exceptionable mea&s;ures, and re|flecting on the unhappy
fate, which had attended his family, endeavoured to depart &s;ecretly beyond
&s;ea, but was di&s;covered and thrown into the Tower. In 1587 this nobleman
was brought to his trial for high trea&s;on; chiefly becau&s;e he had dropped
&s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of affection to the Spaniards, and had affirmed that he
would have ma&s;&s;es &s;aid for the &s;ucce&s;s of the armada. His peers found
him guilty of trea&s;on: This &s;evere &s;entence was not executed; but Arundel
never recovered his liberty. He died a pri&s;oner in 1595. He carried his
religious au&s;terities &s;o far, that they were believed the immediate cau&s;e
of his death.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE bloody de&s;igns now appeared every where, as the re&s;ult
of that bigotted &s;pirit by which the two religions, e&s;pecially the
catholic, were at this time actu|ated. One Somerville, a gentleman of the
county of Warwic, &s;omewhat di&s;|ordered in his under&s;tanding, had heard
&s;o much of the merit attending the a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ination of heretics and
per&s;ecutors, that he came to London with a view of murdering the Queen; but
having betrayed his de&s;ign by &s;ome extravagances, he was thrown into
pri&s;on, and there peri&s;hed by a voluntary death<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 495.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of the Low Coun|tries.</NOTE> About
the &s;ame time, Baltazar Gerard, a Burgundian, undertook, and executed the
&s;ame de&s;ign again&s;t the prince of Orange; and that great man peri&s;hed
at Del&s;t, by the hands of a de&s;perate a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who, with a
re&s;olution worthy of a better cau&s;e, &s;acrificed his own life, in order to
de&s;troy the famous re&s;torer and pro|tector of religious liberty. The
Flemings, who regarded that prince as their fa|ther, were filled with infinite
regret, as well when they con&s;idered the mi&s;erable end of &s;o brave a
patriot, as their own forlorn condition, from the lo&s;s of &s;o 
<PB N="584" REF="189"> powerful and prudent a leader, and from the rapid
progre&s;s of the Spani&s;h arms. The prince of Parma had made every year great
advances upon them, had re|duced &s;everal of the provinces to obedience, and
had laid clo&s;e &s;iege to Antwerp, the riche&s;t and mo&s;t populous city of
the Netherlands, who&s;e &s;ubjection, it was fore&s;een, would give a mortal
blow to the already declining affairs of the revolted States. The only hopes
which remained to them, aro&s;e from the pro&s;pect of fo|reign &s;uccours.
Being well acquainted with the cautious and frugal maxims of Elizabeth, they
promi&s;ed them&s;elves better &s;ucce&s;s in France; and in the view of
engaging Henry to embrace their defence, they tendered him the &s;ove|reignty
of their provinces. But the pre&s;ent condition of that monarchy ob|liged the
King to reject &s;o advantageous an offer. The duke of Anjou's death, which, he
thought, would have delivered him from the intrigues of that fickle and
turbulent prince, plunged him into the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s; and the King of
Navarre, a profe&s;&s;ed Hugonot, being next heir to the crown, the duke of
Gui&s;e took thence occa&s;ion to revive the catholic league, and to urge
Henry, by the mo&s;t violent expedients, to &s;eek the exclu&s;ion and
&s;uppre&s;&s;ion of that brave and virtuous prince. Henry him&s;elf, tho' a
zealous catholic, yet, becau&s;e he declined complying with their precipitant
mea&s;ures, became an object of aver&s;ion to the league; and as his zeal in
practi&s;ing all the &s;uper&s;titious ob&s;ervances of the Romi&s;h church,
was accompanied with a very licentious conduct in private life, the catholic
faction, in contradiction to the mo&s;t vulgar experience, embraced thence the
pretext of repre&s;enting his devotion as mere hypocri&s;y and deceit. Finding
his authority to decline, he was obliged to declare war again&s;t the Hugonots,
and to put arms into the hands of the League, whom, both on ac|count of their
dangerous preten&s;ions at home, and their clo&s;e alliance with Philip, he
&s;ecretly regarded as his more dangerous enemies. Con&s;trained by the &s;ame
po|licy, he perceived the danger of a&s;&s;ociating him&s;elf with the revolted
prote&s;tants in the Low Countries, and was obliged to renounce that inviting
occa&s;ion of re|venging him&s;elf for all the ho&s;tile intrigues and
enterprizes of Philip.</P>
<P>THE States, reduced to this extremity, &s;ent over a &s;olemn
emba&s;&s;y to London, and made offer to the Queen, of acknowleging her for
their &s;overeign, on con|dition of obtaining her protection and
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Elizabeth's wi&s;e&s;t coun&s;ellors were very much divided
in opinion, in regard to the conduct which &s;he &s;hould hold in this critical
and important emergence. Some advi&s;ed the rejecting the offer of the States,
and repre&s;ented the imminent dangers, as well as inju&s;tice, attending the
acceptance of them. They &s;aid, that the rebellion of &s;ubjects was the
common cau&s;e of all &s;overeigns, and the encouragement of a revolt in the
Flemi&s;h, might prove the example to a like pernicious practice in the
Engli&s;h: <PB N="585" REF="190"> That tho' princes were bound by the laws of
the Supreme Being, not to oppre&s;s their &s;ubjects, the people never were
entitled to forget all duty to their &s;overeign, or transfer, from every fancy
or di&s;gu&s;t, or even from the ju&s;te&s;t ground of complaint, their
obedience to any other ma&s;ter: That the Queen, in the &s;uccours hitherto
afforded the Flemings, had con&s;idered them as labouring under
oppre&s;|&s;ion, not as entitled to freedom; and had intended only to
admoni&s;h Philip not to per&s;evere in his tyranny, without any view of
ravi&s;hing from him the&s;e pro|vinces, which he enjoyed by hereditary right
from his ance&s;tors: That her &s;itua|tion in Ireland, and even in England,
would afford that powerful monarch &s;uffi|cient opportunity of retaliating
upon her; and &s;he mu&s;t henceforth expect, that, in&s;tead of &s;ecretly
&s;omenting faction, he would openly employ his whole force in the protection
and defence of the catholics. That the pope would undoubtedly unite his
&s;piritual arms to the temporal ones of Spain; and that the Queen would &s;oon
repent her making &s;o &s;mall and precarious an acqui&s;ition in foreign
countries, by expo&s;ing her own dominions to &s;uch imminent danger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 507. Bentivoglio, partz. lib. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OTHER coun&s;ellors of Elizabeth maintained a contrary opinion.
They a&s;|&s;erted, that the Queen had not even from the beginning of her
reign, but cer|tainly had not at pre&s;ent, the choice, whether &s;he would
embrace friend&s;hip or ho&s;tility with Philip: That by the whole tenor of
that prince's conduct it ap|peared, that his &s;ole aims were, the exten&s;ion
of his empire, and the utter ex|termination of the prote&s;tants, under the
&s;pecious pretence of maintaining the ca|tholic faith: That the provocations
which &s;he had already given him, joined to this general &s;cheme of policy,
would for ever render him her implacable enemy; and as &s;oon as he had
&s;ubdued his revolted &s;ubjects, he would undoubtedly fall, with the whole
force of his united empire, on her defencele&s;s &s;tate: That the only
que&s;tion was, whether &s;he would maintain a war, abroad and &s;upported by
allies, or wait till the &s;ubjection of all the confederates of England,
&s;hould give her enemies lei&s;ure to begin their ho&s;tilities in the bowels
of that kingdom: That the revolted provinces, tho' in a declining condition,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;till con&s;iderable force; and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
England, by the advantages of their &s;ituation, and by their inveterate
antipathy to Philip, might &s;till be enabled to maintain the conte&s;t
again&s;t the Spani&s;h monarchy: That their maritime power, united to the
Queen's would give her entire &s;ecurity on that &s;ide from which alone &s;he
could be a&s;&s;aulted, and would even enable her to make inroads on Philip's
dominions, both in Europe and the Indies: That a war which was nece&s;&s;ary,
could never be unju&s;t; and &s;elf-defence was concerned, as well in warding
certain dangers at a di&s;tance, as in repelling any immediate inva&s;ion: And
that &s;ince ho&s;tility with <PB N="586" REF="191"> Spain was the unavoidable
con&s;equence of the pre&s;ent intere&s;ts and &s;ituations of the two
monarchies, it was better to compen&s;ate that danger and lo&s;s by the
ac|qui&s;ition of &s;uch important provinces to the Engli&s;h empire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, ibid. Bentivoglio, ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMIDST the&s;e oppo&s;ite councils, the Queen, apprehen&s;ive of
the con&s;equences attending each extreme, was inclined to &s;teer a middle
cour&s;e; and tho' &s;uch con|duct is &s;eldom prudent, &s;he was not, in this
re&s;olution, guided by any prejudice or affection. She was determined not to
&s;ee, without oppo&s;ition, the total ruin of the revolted provinces, who&s;e
intere&s;ts &s;he e&s;teemed &s;o clo&s;ely connected with her own: But
fore&s;eeing, that the acceptance of their &s;overeignty would engage her to
employ her whole force in their defence, would give umbrage to her neigh|bours,
and would expo&s;e her to the reproach of ambition and u&s;urpation,
impu|tations which &s;he had hitherto carefully avoided, &s;he immediately rej
cted this offer. She concluded a league with the States on the following
conditions: That &s;he &s;hould &s;end over an army to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
of five thou&s;and foot and a thou|&s;and hor&s;e, and pay them during the war;
that the general, and two others, whom &s;he &s;hould appoint, &s;hould be
admitted into the council of the States; that neither party &s;hould make peace
without the con&s;ent of the other; that her expences &s;hould be refunded
after the conclu&s;ion of the war; and that the towns of Flu&s;hing and the
Brille, with the ca&s;tle of Rammekins, &s;hould, in the mean time, be
con&s;igned into her hands, by way of &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>THE Queen knew that this mea&s;ure would immediately engage her
in open ho&s;tilities with Philip; yet was &s;he not terrified with the view of
the pre&s;ent greatne&s;s of that ambitious, and enterprizing monarch. The
continent of Spain was at that time rich and populous; and the late addition of
Portugal, be&s;ides &s;ecuring internal tranquillity, had annexed an opulent
kingdom to Philip's dominions, had made him ma&s;ter of many &s;ettlements in
the Ea&s;t-Indies, and of the whole commerce of tho&s;e regions, and had
mightily increa&s;ed his naval power, in which he was before chiefly deficient.
All the princes of Italy, even the pope and the court of Rome, were reduced to
a kind of &s;ubjection under him, and &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s their
&s;overeignty on very precarious and uncertain terms. The Au&s;trian branch in
Germany, with all their dependant principalities, was clo&s;ely connected with
him, and was ready to &s;upply him with troops for every enter|prize. The whole
trea&s;ures of the We&s;t Indies were in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and the
pre&s;ent &s;carcity of the precious metals in every country of Europe,
rendered the in&s;&s;uence of his riches the more forcible and exten&s;ive. The
Netherlands &s;eem|ed on the point of relap&s;ing into &s;ervitude; and &s;mall
hopes were entertained of <PB N="587" REF="192"> their with&s;tanding tho&s;e
numerous and veteran armies which, under the command of the mo&s;t experienced
generals, he employed again&s;t them. Even France, which u&s;ed to
counterballance the Au&s;trian greatne&s;s, had lo&s;t all her force from
inte&s;tine commotions; and as the catholics, the ruling party, were clo&s;ely
con|nected with him, he rather expected thence an augmentation, than a
diminution, of his power. Upon the whole, &s;uch prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were
every where entertained concerning the force of the Spani&s;h monarchy, that
the King of Sweden, when he heard that Elizabeth had openly embraced the
defence of the revolted Flem|ings, &s;crupled not to &s;ay, that &s;he had now
taken the diadem from her head, and had adventured it upon the doubtful chance
of war<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">8.</NOTE>. Yet was this prince&s;s
ra|ther cautious than enterprizing in her natural temper: She ever needed more
to be impelled by the vigour, than re&s;trained by the prudence of her
mini&s;ters: But when &s;he &s;aw an evident nece&s;&s;ity, &s;he braved danger
with magnanimous courage; and tru&s;ting to her own con&s;ummate wi&s;dom, and
to the affections, however di|vided, of her people, &s;he prepared her&s;elf to
re&s;i&s;t, and even to a&s;&s;ault, the whole force of the catholic
monarch.</P>
<P>THE earl of Leice&s;ter was &s;ent over to Holland, at the head
of the Engli&s;h auxiliary forces. He carried with him a &s;plendid retinue;
being accompa|nied with the young earl of E&s;&s;ex, his &s;on in-law, the
lords Audley and North, Sir William Ru&s;&s;el, Sir Thomas Shirley, Sir Arthur
Ba&s;&s;et, Sir Walter Waller. Sir Gerva&s;e Clifton, and a &s;elect troop of
five hundred gentlemen. He was re|ceived, on his arrival at Flu&s;hing, by his
nephew, Sir Philip Sidney, the go|vernor; and every town thro' which he
pa&s;&s;ed, expre&s;&s;ed their joy by acclama|tions, and triumphal arches, as
if his pre&s;ence, and the Queen's protection, had brought them the mo&s;t
certain deliverance. The States, de&s;irous of engaging Elizabeth &s;till
farther in their defence, and knowing the intere&s;t which Leice&s;ter
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="5 letters">&s;&s;ed with her, con&s;erred on
him the title of governor and captain-general of the United Provinces,
appointed a guard to attend him, and treated him, in
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;pects, as their
&s;overeign. But this &s;tep had a contrary effect to what they expected. The
Queen was di&s;plea&s;ed with the artifice of the States,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> of Leice&s;ter. She
reprimanded both of them very &s;everely by l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tters and it was with &s;ome difficulty, that, after many humble
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, they were able to appea&s;e her.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> AMERICA was regarded as the chief
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ource of Philip's power, as will
as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oll de&s;encele&s;s part of
his dominions; and Elizabeth finding that an
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> reach with that monarch was
unavoidable, re&s;olved not to leave him unmole&s;ted on that 
<PB N="588" REF="193"> quarter. The great &s;ucce&s;s of the Spaniards and
Portugueze in both Indies had excited a &s;pirit of emulation in England; and
as the &s;ucce&s;s of commerce, &s;till more of planting colonies, is &s;low
and gradual, it was happy, that a war, in this critical age, had opened a more
flattering pro&s;pect to the avarice and ambition of the Eng|li&s;h, and had
tempted them, by the view of &s;udden and exorbitant profit, to en|gage in
naval enterprizes. A fleet of twenty &s;ail was equipped to attack the
Spa|niard in the We&s;t-Indies: Two thou&s;and three hundred volunteers,
be&s;ides &s;ea|men, engaged on board of it: Sir Francis Drake was appointed
admiral; Chri&s;|topher Carli&s;le commander of the land forces. They took St.
Jago, near Cape Verde, by &s;urprize; and found in it plenty of provi&s;ions,
but no riches. <MILESTONE N="1586" UNIT="year"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 January.</NOTE> They &s;ailed to
Hi&s;paniola; and ea&s;ily making them&s;elves ma&s;ter of St. Domingo by
a&s;|&s;ault, obliged the inhabitants to ran&s;om their hou&s;es by a &s;um of
money. Cartha|gena fell next into their hands, after &s;ome more
re&s;i&s;tance, and was treated in the &s;ame manner. They burned St. Anthony
and St. Helens, two towns on the coa&s;t of Florida. Sailing along the coa&s;t
of Virginia, they found the &s;mall remains of a colony which had been planted
there by Sir Walter Raleigh, and which had gone extremely to decay. This was
the fir&s;t attempt of the Engli&s;h to form &s;uch &s;et|tlements; and tho'
they have &s;ince &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all European nations, both in the
&s;ituations of their colonies, and in the noble principles of liberty and
indu&s;try, on which they are founded; they had here been &s;o
un&s;ucce&s;sful, that the mi&s;e|rable planters abandoned their &s;ettlements,
and prevailed on Drake to carry them with him to England. He returned with &s;o
much riches as encouraged the vo|lunteers, and with &s;uch accounts of the
Spani&s;h weakne&s;s in tho&s;e countries as &s;erved extremely to inflame the
&s;pirits of the nation to future enterprizes. The great mortality which the
climate had produced in his fleet, was, as is u&s;ual, but a feeble re&s;traint
on the avidity and &s;anguine hopes of young adventurers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 509.</NOTE>. It is thought that Drake's fleet fir&s;t
introduced the u&s;e of tobacco into England.</P>
<P>THE enterprizes of Leice&s;ter were much le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful
than tho&s;e of Drake. This man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither courage nor capacity,
equal to the tru&s;ts repo&s;ed in him by the Queen; and as he was the only bad
choice whom &s;he made for any con&s;iderable advancement, men naturally
believed, that &s;he had here been influ|enced by an affection &s;till more
partial than that of friend&s;hip. He gained at fir&s;t &s;ome advantage in an
action again&s;t the Spaniards; and threw &s;uccours into Grave, by which that
place was enabled to make a vigorous defence: But the cowardice of the
governor, Van Hemert, rendered all the&s;e efforts u&s;ele&s;s. He capitulated
after a very feeble re&s;i&s;tance; and being tried for his conduct, &s;uffered
a capital puni&s;hment from the &s;entence of a court martial. The prince of
Par|ma <PB N="589" REF="194"> next undertook the &s;iege of Venlo, which was
&s;urrendered to him, after &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance. The fate of Nuys was more
di&s;mal; being taken by a&s;&s;ault, while the garri&s;on was treating of a
capitulation. Rhimberg, which was garri&s;oned by twelve hundred Engli&s;h,
under the command of colonel Morgan, was afterwards be&s;ieged by the
Spaniards; and Leice&s;ter, thinking him&s;elf too weak to attempt rai&s;ing
the &s;iege, endeavoured to draw off the prince of Parma by forming &s;ome
other enterprize. He fir&s;t attacked Doe&s;berg, and &s;ucceeded: He then
&s;at down before Zutphen, which the Spani&s;h general thought &s;o important a
place, that he ha&s;tened to its relief. He made the marque&s;s of Gua&s;to
advance with a convoy, which he intended to throw into the place. They were
favoured by a fog; but falling by chance on a body of Engli&s;h cavalry, a
furious action en&s;ued, in which the Spaniards were wor&s;ted, and the
marque&s;s of Gonzaga, an Italian nobleman of great reputation and family, was
&s;lain. The pur&s;uit was &s;topt by the advance of the prince of Parma with
the main body of the Spani&s;h army; and the Engli&s;h cavalry, on their return
from the field, found their advantage more than compen|&s;ated by the lo&s;s of
Sir Philip Sidney, who, being mortally wounded in the ac|tion, was carried off
by the &s;oldiers, and &s;oon after died. This per&s;on is de|&s;cribed by the
writers of that age as the mo&s;t perfect model of an accompli&s;hed gentleman
which was ever formed even by the wanton imagination of poetry or fiction.
Virtuous conduct, polite conver&s;ation, heroic valour, and elegant erudition,
all concurred to render him the ornament and delight of the Engli&s;h court;
and as the credit which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Queen and the earl of
Lei|ce&s;ter, was wholly employed in the encouragement of genius and
literature, his prai&s;es have been tran&s;mitted with advantage to
po&s;terity. No per&s;on was &s;o low as not to become an object of his
humanity. After this la&s;t action, while he was lying on the field, mangled
with wounds, a bottle of water was brought him to relieve his thir&s;t; but
ob&s;erving a &s;oldier near him in a like mi&s;erable condition, he &s;aid,
<HI>This man's nece&s;&s;ity is &s;till greater than mine:</HI> And re&s;igned
to him the bottle of water. The King of Scots, &s;truck with admiration of
Sidney's virtue, celebrated his memory by a copy of Latin ver&s;es, which he
compo&s;ed on occa&s;ion of the death of that young hero.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h, tho' a long peace had deprived them of all
experience, were &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of military genius; and the
advantages gained by the prince of Parma were not attributed to the &s;uperior
bravery and di&s;cipline of the Spaniards, but &s;olely to the mi&s;conduct of
Leice&s;ter. The States were much di&s;contented with his management of the
war; but &s;till more with his arbitrary and imperious conduct; and at the end
of the campaign, they applied to him for a redre&s;s of <PB N="590" REF="195">
all their grievances. But Leice&s;ter, without giving them any &s;atisfaction,
de|parted &s;oon after for England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 512.

<P>THE Queen, while &s;he provoked &s;o powerful an enemy as the
King of Spain, was not forgetful to &s;ecure her&s;elf on the &s;ide of
Scotland; and &s;he endeavoured both to cultivate the friend&s;hip and alliance
of her kin&s;man, James, and to re|move all grounds of quarrel between them. An
attempt which &s;he had made &s;ome time before, was not well calculated to
gain the confidence of that prince. She di&s;patched Wotton as her
amba&s;&s;ador to Scotland; but tho' &s;he gave him pri|vate in&s;tructions
with regard to her affairs, &s;he informed James, that when &s;he had any
political bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;cu&s;s with him, &s;he would employ another
mini&s;ter&punc; that this man was not fitted for &s;erious negociations; and
that her chief purpo&s;e in &s;ending him, was to entertain the King with witty
and facetious conver&s;ation, and to partake without re&s;erve of his
plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements. Wotton was ma&s;ter of profound
di&s;&s;imulation, and knew how to cover, under the appearance of a carele&s;s
gaiety, the deepe&s;t de&s;igns, and mo&s;t dangerous artifices. When but a
youth of twenty, he had been employed by his uncle, Dr. Wotton, amba&s;|&s;ador
in France during the reign of Mary, to en&s;nare the con&s;table, Montmo|rency;
and had not his purpo&s;e been fru&s;trated by pure accident, his cunning had
prevailed over all the caution and experience of that aged mini&s;ter. It is no
wonder, that, after years had &s;o much improved him in all arts of deceit, he
&s;hould gain an a&s;cendent over a young prince, of &s;o open and unguarded a
temper as James, e&s;pecially when the Queen's recommendation prepared the way
for his artifices. He was admitted into all the plea&s;ures of the King; made
him&s;elf ma|&s;ter of all his &s;ecrets; and had &s;o much the more authority
with him in political tran&s;actions, that he did not &s;eem to pay the lea&s;t
attention or regard to the&s;e mat|ters. The Scotch mini&s;ters, who ob&s;erved
the growing intere&s;t of this man, en|deavoured to acquire his friend&s;hip;
and &s;crupled not to &s;acrifice to his intrigues the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential
intere&s;ts of their ma&s;ter. Elizabeth's u&s;ual jealou&s;ies with re|gard to
her heirs began now to be levelled again&s;t James; and as that prince had a
tained the years proper for marriage, &s;he was apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t, by
being &s;trengthened with children and alliances, he &s;hould acquire the
greater intere&s;t and authority with her Engli&s;h &s;ubjects. She directed
Wotton to form a &s;ecret con|cert with &s;ome Scotch nobleman, and to procure
their promi&s;e, that James, during three years, &s;hould not, on any account,
be permitted to marry. In con&s;equence of this view, they endeavoured to
embroil him with the King of Denmark, who had &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to
Scotland, under pretence of demanding the re&s;titution of the 
<PB N="591" REF="196"> Orkneys, but really with a view of opening a propo&s;al
of marriage between James and his daughter. Wotton is &s;aid to have employed
his intrigues to purpo&s;es &s;till more dangerous. He formed a con&s;piracy
with &s;ome malecontents, to &s;eize the per|&s;on of the King, and to deliver
him into the hands of Elizabeth, who would pro|bably have denied all
concurrence in the de&s;ign, but who would have been care|ful to retain him in

Wotton fled ha&s;tily from Scotland, without taking leave of the King<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melvil.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>JAMES'S &s;ituation obliged him to di&s;&s;emble his
re&s;entment of this traiterous attempt, and his natural temper inclined him
&s;oon to forgive and forget it. The Queen found no difficulty to renew the
negociations for a &s;trict alliance between Scotland and England; and the more
effectually to gain the prince's affections, &s;he granted him a pen&s;ion,
equivalent to his claim on the inheritance of his grandmother the counte&s;s of
Lenox, lately decea&s;ed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p.

defence of their dominions, and of their religion, now menaced by the open
combination of all the catholic powers of Europe. It was &s;tipulated, that if
Elizabeth was invaded, James &s;hould aid her with a body of two thou&s;and
hor&s;e and five thou&s;and foot; that Elizabeth, in a like ca&s;e; &s;hould
&s;end to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance three thou&s;and hor&s;e and &s;ix thou&s;and

demanded a&s;&s;i&s;tance; that if the inva&s;ion &s;hould be made upon
England, within &s;ixty miles of the frontiers of Scotland, this latter kingdom
&s;hould march its whole forces to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the former; and that

<P>BY this league James &s;ecured him&s;elf again&s;t all attempts
from abroad, opened a way for acquiring the confidence and affection of the
Engli&s;h, and might en|tertain &s;ome pro&s;pect of dome&s;tic tranquillity,
which, &s;o long as he lived on bad terms with Elizabeth, he could never expect
long to enjoy. Be&s;ides the turbulent di&s;po&s;ition, and inveterate feuds of
the nobility, ancient maladies of the Scotch government, the &s;pirit of
fanatici&s;m had introduced a new di&s;order; &s;o much the more dangerous,
that religion, when corrupted by fal&s;e opinion, is not re&s;trained by any
rules of morality, and is even &s;earcely to be accounted for in its
operati|ons, by any principles of ordinary conduct and policy. The in&s;olence
of the Scotch preachers, who triumphed in their dominion over the populace,
had, at <PB N="592" REF="197"> this time, reached an extreme height; and they
carried their arrogance &s;o far, not only again&s;t the King, but again&s;t
the Parliament, and the whole civil power, that they dared to excommunicate the
archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews, becau&s;e he had been active for promoting a law
which re&s;trained their &s;editious &s;ermons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 345, 346.</NOTE>: Nor could that prelate &s;ave
him&s;elf any way from this terrible &s;entence, but by re|nouncing all
preten&s;ions to eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority. One Gib&s;on &s;aid in the
pulpit, that captain James Stuart (meaning the late earl of Arran) and his
wife, Jeza|bel, had been e&s;teemed the chief per&s;ecutors of the church; but
it was now &s;een, that the King him&s;elf was the great offender: And for this
crime the preacher denounced again&s;t him, the cur&s;e which fell on Jeroboam,
that he &s;hould die childle&s;s, and be the la&s;t of his race<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 344.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;ecretary, perceiving the King &s;o much mole&s;ted with

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE dangers which aro&s;e from the character, principles, and
preten&s;ions of the Queen of Scots, had engaged, very early, Elizabeth to
con&s;ult, in her treatment of that unfortunate prince&s;s, the dictates of
jealou&s;y and politics, <PB N="593" REF="198"> rather than of friend&s;hip or
genero&s;ity: The re&s;entment of this u&s;age had pu&s;hed Mary into
enterprizes, which had very nearly threatened the repo&s;e and authority of
Elizabeth: The rigour and re&s;traint, which were thence redoubled upon the
captive Queen<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 139. Haynes, p.
607.</NOTE>, &s;till impelled her to attempt greater extremities; and while her
impa|tience of confinement, her revenge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mary's extreme
animo&s;ity again&s;t Elizabeth may ea&s;ily be conceived, and broke out, about
this time, in an incident, which may appear curious. While the former Queen was
kept in cu&s;tody by the earl of Shrew&s;bury, &s;he lived during a long time
in great intimacy with the counte&s;s; but that lady, entertaining jealou&s;y
of an amour between her and the earl, their friend&s;hip was converted into
enmity; and Mary took a method of revenge, which at once gratified her &s;pite
again&s;t the counte&s;s and that again&s;t Elizabeth. She wrote to the Queen,
informing her of all the malicious &s;candalous &s;tories, which, &s;he &s;aid,
the counte&s;s of Shrew&s;bury had reported of her: That Elizabeth had given a
promi&s;e of marriage to a certain per&s;on, whom &s;he afterwards often
admitted to her bed: That &s;he had been equally indulgent to Simier, the
French agent, and to the duke of Anjou: That Hatton was al&s;o one of her
paramours, who was even di&s;gu&s;ted with her exce&s;&s;ive love and
fondne&s;s: That tho' &s;he was on other occa&s;ions avaritious to the la&s;t
degree, as well as ungrateful, and kind to very few, &s;he &s;pared no expence
in gratifying her amorous pa&s;&s;ions: That notwith&s;tanding her licentious
amours, &s;he was not made like other women; and all tho&s;e who courted her
marriage would in the end be di&s;appointed: That &s;he was &s;o conceited of
her beauty, as to &s;wallow the mo&s;t extravagant flattery from her courtiers,
who could not, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, forbear even &s;neering at her for her
folly: That it was u&s;ual for them to tell her, that the lu&s;tre of her
beauty dazled them like that of the &s;un, and they could not be|hold it with a
fixed eye: She added, that the counte&s;s had &s;aid, that Mary's be&s;t policy
would be to engage her &s;on to make love to the Queen; nor was there any
danger that &s;uch a propo&s;al would be taken for mockery; &s;o ridiculous was
the opinion which &s;he had entertained of her own charms. She pretended, that
the counte&s;s had repre&s;ented her as no le&s;s odious in her temper than
pro&s;tigate in her manners, and ab&s;urd in her vanity: That &s;he had &s;o
beaten a young woman of the name of Scudamore as to break that lady's finger;
and in order to cover over the matter, it was pretended, that the accident had
proceeded from the fall of a candle&s;tick: That &s;he had cut another acro&s;s
the hand with a knife, who had been &s;o unfortunate as to offend her. Mary
added, that the counte&s;s had informed her, that Elizabeth had &s;uborned
Rol&s;tone to pretend friend&s;hip to her, in order to debauch her, and thereby
throw in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">amy on her rival. See
Murden's State Papers, p. 558. This imprudent and malicious letter was wrote a
very little before the detection of Queen Mary's con&s;piracy; and contributed,
no doubt, to render the proceedings again&s;t her more rigorous. How far all
the&s;e imputations again&s;t Elizabeth can be credited, may perhaps appear
doubtful: But her extreme fondne&s;s for Leice&s;ter, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tton, and Ea&s;ex, not to mention Mountjoy and others,
with the curious pa&s;&s;ages between her and admiral Say mour, contained in
Haynes, render her cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lity very
&s;u&s;picious. Her &s;elf conceit with regard to beauty, we know from other
undoubted authority, to have been extravagant. Even when &s;he was a very old
woman, &s;he allowed her counters to flatter her with regard to her
<HI>excellent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> Birch, vol
II p. 442, 443. Her pa&s;&s;ionate temper may al&s;o be proved from many lively
in&s;tance ; and it was not unu&s;ual with her to beat her maids of honour. See
the Sydney Papers, vol. II. p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">8.
The blow the gave to E&s;&s;ex before the privy council is another in&s;tance.
Had this Queen been both in a private &s;tation, &s;he would not have been very
amiable: But her ab&s;olute authority, at the &s;ame time that it gave an
uncontroled &s;wing to her violent pa&s;&s;ions, enabled her to compen&s;ate
for her infirmities by many great and &s;ignal virtues.</NOTE>, and her high
&s;pirit concurred with religious <PB N="594" REF="199"> zeal, and the
&s;ugge&s;tions of de&s;perate bigots, &s;he was at la&s;t engaged in
de&s;igns, which afforded her enemies, who waited for the opportunity, a
pretext or rea&s;on for effectuating her final ruin.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeal of the catholics.</NOTE> THE Engli&s;h
&s;eminary at Rheims had wrought them&s;elves up to a high pitch of rage and
animo&s;ity again&s;t the Queen. The recent per&s;ecutions, from which they had
fled: The new rigours, which, they knew, awaited them in the cour&s;e of their
mi&s;&s;ions: The liberty which for the pre&s;ent they enjoyed of declaim|ing
again&s;t that prince&s;s: And the contagion of religious fury, which every
where &s;urrounded them in France: All the&s;e cau&s;es had obliterated with
them every maxim of common &s;en&s;e, and every principle of morals or
humanity. Intoxi|cated with admiration of the omnipotence and infallibility of
the pope, they re|vered his bull by which he excommunicated and depo&s;ed the
Queen; and &s;ome of them had gone to that height of extravagance, as to
a&s;&s;ert, that that perfor|mance had been immediately dictated by the Holy
Gho&s;t. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of heretical &s;overeigns, and of that
prince&s;s in particular, was repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t meritorious of all
enterprizes; and they taught, that whoever peri&s;hed in &s;uch pious attempts
enjoyed without di&s;pute the glorious and never-fading crown of martyrdom. By
&s;uch doctrines, they in&s;tigated John Savage, a man of de&s;|perate courage,
who had &s;erved &s;ome years in the Low Countries under the prince of Parma,
to attempt the life of Elizabeth; and this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, having made a vow
to per&s;evere in his de&s;ign, was &s;ent over to England, and recommended to
the confidence of the more zealous catholics.</P>
<P>ABOUT the &s;ame time, John Ballard, a prie&s;t of that
&s;eminary, had returned to Paris from his mi&s;&s;ion in England and Scotland;
and as he had di&s;covered a &s;pirit of mutiny and rebellion very prevalent
among the catholic devotees in the&s;e countries, he had founded on that
di&s;po&s;ition the project of dethroning Eli|zabeth, and of re&s;toring by
force of arms the exerci&s;e of the antient religion in England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Murden's State Papers, p. 517.</NOTE>. The &s;ituation of affairs
abroad &s;eemed favourable to this enterprize: The pope, the Spaniard, the duke
of Gui&s;e, the prince, created by the pope duke, of Parma, concurring in
intere&s;ts, had formed a re&s;olution to make &s;ome at|tempt upon the Queen:
And Mendoza, the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, &s;trongly encouraged
Ballard to hope for &s;uccours from the&s;e princes. Charles Paget alone, a
zealous catholic and a devoted partizan of the Queen of Scots, being well
ac|quainted with the prudence, vigour, and general popularity of Elizabeth,
al|ways <PB N="595" REF="200"> maintained, that &s;o long as that prince&s;s
was allowed to live, it was in vain to expect any &s;ucce&s;s from an
enterprize upon England. Ballard, per&s;uaded of this truth, &s;aw more clearly
the nece&s;&s;ity of executing the de&s;ign, formed at Rheims: He came over to
England in the di&s;gui&s;e of a &s;oldier, and a&s;&s;umed the name of captain
Forte&s;cue: And he bent his endeavours to effectuate at once the project of an
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, an in&s;urrection and an inva&s;ion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 515.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Babington's con&s;piracy.</NOTE> THE fir&s;t
per&s;on, to whom he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, was Anthony Babington of Dothic
in the county of Derby. This young gentleman was of a good fa|mily,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a plentiful fortune, had di&s;covered an excellent capacity,
and was accompli&s;hed in literature beyond mo&s;t of his years or &s;tation.
Being zealou&s;ly devoted to the catholic communion, he had &s;ecretly made a
journey to Paris &s;ome time before; and had fallen into intimacy with Thomas
Morgan, a bigotted fugitive from England, and with the bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow,
Mary's amba&s;&s;ador to the court of France. By continually extolling the
amiable accompli&s;hments and heroical virtues of that prince&s;s, they
inflamed the unguarded mind of young Babington to make &s;ome attempt for her
&s;ervice; and they employed every prin|ciple of ambition, gallantry, and
religious zeal to give him a contempt of tho&s;e dangers, which attended any
enterprize again&s;t the vigilant government of Eli|zabeth. Finding him well
di&s;po&s;ed for their purpo&s;e, they &s;ent him back to England, and
&s;ecretly, unknown to him&s;elf, recommended him to the Queen of Scots as a
per&s;on worth engaging in her &s;ervice. She wrote him a letter, full of
friend&s;hip and confidence; and Babington, &s;anguine in his temper and
zealous in his principles, thought, that the&s;e advances now bound him in
honour to de|vote him&s;elf entirely to the &s;ervice of that unfortunate
prince&s;s. During &s;ome time, he had found means of conveying to her all her
foreign corre&s;pondence; but after &s;he was put under the cu&s;tody of Sir
Amias Paulet, and reduced to a more rigorous confinement, he experienced &s;o
much difficulty and danger in rendering her this &s;ervice, that he had
de&s;i&s;ted from every attempt of that nature.</P>
<P>WHEN Ballard began to open his intentions to Babington, he found
his zeal &s;u&s;pended, not extingui&s;hed: His former ardour revived on the
mention of any enterprize, which &s;eemed to promi&s;e &s;ucce&s;s in the
cau&s;e of Mary or of the ca|tholic religion. He had entertained, however,
&s;entiments conformable to tho&s;e of Paget, and repre&s;ented the &s;olly of
all attempts, which, during the life-time of Elizabeth, could be formed
again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion and government of England. Ballard,
encouraged by this hint, proceeded to di&s;cover to him the de&s;ign undertaken
by Savage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. State Trials, p. 111.</NOTE>; and was
plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that, in&s;tead of <PB N="596" REF="201"> being
&s;hocked with that project, Babington only thought it not &s;ecure enough,
when entru&s;ted to one &s;ingle hand, and propo&s;ed to join four others with
Savage in this de&s;perate and bloody enterprize.</P>
<P>IN pro&s;ecution of the&s;e views, Babington employed him&s;elf
in augmenting the number of his a&s;&s;ociates; and he &s;ecretly drew into the
con&s;piracy many catholic gentlemen, di&s;contented with the pre&s;ent
government. Barnwel, of a noble family in Ireland, Charnoc, a gentleman of
Lanca&s;hire, and Abington, who&s;e father had been cofferer to the hou&s;hold,
readily undertook the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the Queen. Charles Tilney the
heir of a very antient family, and Titchborne of Southampton, when the de&s;ign
was propo&s;ed to them, expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;cruples, which were at la&s;t
removed by the arguments of Babington and Ballard. Savage alone refu&s;ed for
&s;ome time to &s;hare the glory of the enterprize with any others<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 111.</NOTE>; he challenged
the whole to him&s;elf; and it was with &s;ome difficulty he was in|duced to
depart from this prepo&s;terous ambition.</P>
<P>THE delivery of the Queen of Scots, at the very &s;ame
in&s;tant, when Eliza|beth &s;hould be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, was requi&s;ite
for effecting the purpo&s;e of the con&s;pi|rators; and Babington undertook,
with a party of an hundred hor&s;e, to attack her guards, while &s;he &s;hould
be taking the air on hor&s;eback. In this enterprize, he engaged Edward
Wind&s;or, brother to the lord of that name, Thomas Sali&s;bury, Robert Gage,
John Travers, John Jones, and Henry Donne; mo&s;t of them men of family and
intere&s;t. The con&s;pirators much wanted, but could not find, any nobleman of
name, whom they might place at the head of their enterprize; but they
tru&s;ted, that the great events, of the Queen's death and Mary's delivery,
would rouze all the zealous catholics to arms; and that foreign forces, taking
ad|vantage of the general confu&s;ion, would ea&s;ily fix the Queen of Scots on
the throne, and re-e&s;tabli&s;h the antient religion.</P>
<P>THESE de&s;perate projects had not e&s;caped the vigilance of
Elizabeth's council, particularly of Wal&s;ingham, &s;ecretary of &s;tate. That
artful mini&s;ter had engaged Maud, a catholic prie&s;t, whom he retained in
pay, to attend Ballard in his jour|ney to France, and had thereby got a hint of
the de&s;igns, entertained by the fu|gitives. Polly, another of his &s;pies,
had found means to in&s;inuate him&s;elf among the con&s;pirators in England;
and tho' not entirely tru&s;ted, had obtained &s;ome in|&s;ight into their
dangerous &s;ecrets. But the bottom of the con&s;piracy was never fully known,
till Gifford, a &s;eminary prie&s;t, came over, and made a tender of his
&s;ervice to Wal&s;ingham. By his means, the di&s;covery became of the utmo&s;t
importance, <PB N="597" REF="202"> and involved the fate of Mary, as well as of
tho&s;e zealous partizans of that prince&s;s.</P>
<P>BABINGTON and his a&s;&s;ociates, having laid &s;uch a &s;cheme,
as, they thought, promi&s;ed infallible &s;ucce&s;s, were impatient to
communicate the de&s;ign to the Queen of Scots, and to obtain her approbation
and concurrence. For this &s;ervice, they employed Gifford, who immediately
applied to Wal&s;ingham, that the intere&s;t of that mini&s;ter might forward
his &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with Mary. Wal&s;ingham propo&s;ed the matter to
Paulet, and de&s;ired him to connive at Gifford's corrupt|ing one of his
&s;ervants: But Paulet was aver&s;e to the introducing &s;uch a perni|cious
precedent into his family, and de&s;ired, that they would rather think of
&s;ome other expedient. Gifford found a brewer, who &s;upplied the family with
ale; and bribed him to convey letters to the captive Queen. The letters, by
Paulet's connivance, were thru&s;t thro' a chink in the wall; and an&s;wers
were returned by the &s;ame conveyance.</P>
<P>BALLARD and Babington were at fir&s;t diffident of Gifford's
fidelity; and to make trial of him, they gave him only blank papers made up
like letters: But find|ing by the an&s;wers, that the&s;e had been faithfully
delivered, they laid a&s;ide all farther &s;cruple, and conveyed by his hands
the mo&s;t criminal and dangerous parts of their con&s;piracy. Babington
informed Mary of the de&s;ign laid for a fo|reign inva&s;ion, the plan of an
in&s;urrection at home, the &s;cheme for her delivery, and the con&s;piracy for
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the u&s;urper, by &s;ix noble gentlemen, as he termed
them, all of them his private friends, who, from the zeal, which they bore to
the catholic cau&s;e and her maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, would undertake the
tragical execution. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mary a&s;&s;ents to the con&s;pi|racy.</NOTE>
Mary replied, that &s;he approved highly of the de&s;ign, that the gentle|men
might expect all the rewards, which it &s;hould ever be in her power to
con|ler, and that the death of Elizabeth was a requi&s;ite circum&s;tance,
before any at|tempts were made either for her own delivery or an
in&s;urrection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p 135. Camden, p.
515</NOTE>. The&s;e letters, with others to Mendoza, Charles Paget, the
archbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, and Sir Francis Ingelfield, were carried by Gifford
to &s;ecretary Wal&s;ingham; were de|cyphered by the art of Philips, his clerk;
and copies taken of them. Wal&s;ing|ham employed a new artifice, in order to
obtain full in&s;ight into the plot: He &s;ubjoined to a letter of Mary's a
po&s;t&s;cript in the &s;ame cypher; in which he made her de&s;ire Babington to
inform her of the names of the &s;ix con&s;pirators. The indi&s;cre|tion of
Babington furni&s;hed Wal&s;ingham with &s;till another means of detection as
well as of defence. That gentleman had made a picture be drawn, where he
him&s;elf was repre&s;ented &s;tanding amid&s;t the &s;ix a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins;
and a motto was &s;ubjoined, ex|pre&s;&s;ing, that their common perils were the
band of their con&s;ederacy. A copy <PB N="598" REF="203"> of this picture was
brought to Elizabeth, that &s;he might know the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and guard
her&s;elf again&s;t their approach to her per&s;on.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, Babington, anxious to en&s;ure and ha&s;ten the
foreign &s;uccours, re&s;olved to di&s;patch Ballard into France; and he
procured for him, under a feigned name, a licence to travel. In order to remove
from him&s;elf all &s;u&s;picion, he applied to Wal&s;ingham, pretended great
zeal for the Queen's &s;ervice, offered to go abroad, and promi&s;ed to employ
that confidence, which he had gained among the catholics, to the detection and
di&s;appointment of their con&s;piracies. Wal|&s;ingham commended his loyal
purpo&s;es; and promi&s;ing his own council and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in the
execution of them, &s;till fed him with hopes, and maintained a clo&s;e
corre&s;pondence with him. A warrant, meanwhile, was i&s;&s;ued for &s;eizing
Ballard; and this incident, joined to the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, begot
in all the con&s;pirators the utmo&s;t anxiety and concern. Some advi&s;ed that
they &s;hould immediately make their e&s;cape: Others propo&s;ed, that Savage
and Charnoc &s;hould without delay execute their purpo&s;e again&s;t Elizabeth;
and Babington, in pro&s;ecution of this &s;cheme, furni&s;hed Savage with
money, that he might buy good cloaths, and have thereby the more ea&s;y
acce&s;s to the Queen's per&s;on. Next day, they began to apprehend, that they
had taken the alarm too ha&s;tily; and Babington, having renewed his
corre&s;pondence with Wal&s;ingham, was per&s;uaded by that &s;ubtle
mini&s;ter, that the &s;eizure of Ballard had proceeded entirely from the
u&s;ual diligence of informers in the detection of popi&s;h and &s;eminary
prie&s;ts. He even con&s;ented to take &s;ecretly lodgings in Wal&s;ingham's
hou&s;e, that they might have more frequent conferences together, before his
intended departure for France: But ob&s;erving, that he was watched and
guarded, he made his e&s;cape, and gave the alarm to the other con&s;pirators.
They all took to flight, covered them&s;elves with &s;everal di&s;gui&s;es, and
lay concealed in woods or barns; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The con&s;pira|tors &s;eized and
executed.</NOTE> but were &s;oon di&s;covered and thrown into pri&s;on. In
their examinations, they contradicted each other; and the leaders were obliged
to make a full confe&s;&s;ion of the truth. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> Fourteen were condemned and
executed: Of whom, &s;even acknow|leged the crime on their trial; the re&s;t
were convicted by evidence.</P>
<P>THE le&s;&s;er con&s;pirators being di&s;patched, mea&s;ures
were taken for the trial and conviction of the Queen of Scots; on who&s;e
account, and by who&s;e concurrence, all the&s;e attempts had been made
again&s;t the life of the Queen, and the tranqui|lity of the kingdom. Some of
Elizabeth's coun&s;ellors were aver&s;e to this proce|dure; and thought, that
the clo&s;e confinement of a woman, who was become very &s;ickly, and who would
probably put a &s;peedy end to their anxiety by her natural death, might give
&s;ufficient &s;ecurity to the government, without attempting a mea&s;ure of
which there &s;carcely remains any example in hi&s;tory. Leice&s;ter
ad|vi&s;ed, <PB N="599" REF="204"> that Mary &s;hould be &s;ecretly
di&s;patched by poi&s;on; and he &s;ent a divine to convince Wal&s;ingham of
the lawfulne&s;s of that action: But Wal&s;ingham de|clared his abhorrence of
it; and in&s;i&s;ted &s;till, in conjunction with the majo|rity of the
coun&s;ellors, for the open trial of the Queen of Scots. The &s;ituation of
England, and of the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters had, indeed, been hitherto not a
little dangerous. No &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the crown was declared; but the heir of
blood, to whom the people in general were likely to adhere, was, by education,
an ene|my to the national religion; was, from multiplied injuries, an enemy to
the mi|ni&s;ters and principal nobility: And their per&s;onal &s;afety, as well
as the &s;ecurity of the government, &s;eemed to hang alone on the Queen's
life, who was now &s;ome|what advanced in years. No wonder, therefore, that
Elizabeth's coun&s;ellors, knowing them&s;elves to be &s;o obnoxious to the
Queen of Scots, endeavoured to pu&s;h every mea&s;ure to extremity again&s;t
her; and were even more anxious than the Queen her&s;elf, to prevent her from
ever mounting the throne of England.</P>
<P>THO' all England was acquainted with the detection of
Babington's con&s;piracy, every avenue to the Queen of Scots was &s;o
&s;trictly guarded, that &s;he remained in utter ignorance of the whole matter;
and it was a great &s;urprize to her, when Sir Thomas Gorges, by Elizabeth's
orders, informed her, that all her partizans were di&s;covered and arre&s;ted.
He cho&s;e the time for giving her this intelligence, when &s;he was mounted on
hor&s;eback to go a hunting; and &s;he was not permitted to return to her
former place of abode, but was conducted from one gentleman's hou&s;e to
another, till &s;he was landed in Fotheringhay ca&s;tle in the county of
Northampton, which it was determined to make the la&s;t &s;tage of her trial
and &s;ufferings. Her two &s;ecretaries, Nau, a Frenchman, and Curle, a Scot,
were immediately arre&s;ted: All her papers were &s;eized, and &s;ent up to the
council: Above &s;ixty different keys to cyphers were di&s;covered: There were
al&s;o found many letters from per&s;ons beyond &s;ea; and &s;everal too from
Engli&s;h noblemen, containing expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect and attachment. The
Queen took no notice of this la&s;t di&s;covery; but the per&s;ons
them&s;elves, knowing their corre&s;pondence to be detected, thought that they
had no other method of making atonement for their imprudence, than declaring
them&s;elves thenceforth the mo&s;t inveterate enemies to the Queen of
Scots<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 518.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;olution to try the Queen of

this very event; and the Queen, in terms of that act, appointed a
commi&s;&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of forty noble|men and privy-coun&s;ellors, and

a letter from Elizabeth, informing her of the commi&s;&s;ion, and of the

the Queen &s;hould command her, as a &s;ubject, to &s;ubmit to a trial and

prince&s;s, and would yield to no|thing which might derogate either from her
royal maje&s;ty, from the &s;tate of &s;o|vereign princes, or from the dignity
and rank of her &s;on: That, however op|pre&s;&s;ed by misfortunes and
calamities, her &s;pirits were not yet &s;o much broke, as her enemies
flattered them&s;elves; nor would &s;he, on any account, be acce&s;&s;ary to
her own degradation and di&s;honour: That &s;he was ignorant of the laws and
&s;ta|tutes of England; was utterly de&s;titute of council; and could not
conceive who were intitled to be called her peers, or could legally &s;it as
judges on her trial: That tho' &s;he had lived in England for many years, &s;he
had lived in captivity; and not having received the protection of the laws,
&s;he could not, merely by her involuntary re&s;idence in the country, be
&s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ubjected her&s;elf to their juri&s;diction and
authority: That notwith&s;tanding the &s;uperiority of her rank, &s;he was
willing to give an account of her conduct before an Engli&s;h Parliament; but
could not view the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners in any other light, than as men
appointed to ju&s;tify, by &s;ome colour of legal proceeding, her condemnation
and execution: And that &s;he warned them to look to their con&s;cience and
their character, in trying an innocent per&s;on; and to reflect, that the&s;e
tran&s;actions would &s;ome|where be &s;ubject to revi&s;ion, and that the

Burleigh, the trea&s;urer, and Bromley, the chancellor, employed much

<P>BY this artful &s;peech, Mary was per&s;uaded to appear before
the court; and thereby gave an appearance of legal procedure to the trial, and
prevented tho&s;e difficulties, which the commi&s;&s;ioners mu&s;t have fallen
into, had &s;he per&s;evered in maintaining &s;o &s;pecious a plea as that of
her &s;overeign and independant character. Her conduct in this particular
mu&s;t be regarded as the more imprudent, that for|merly, when Elizabeth's
commi&s;&s;ioners pretended not to exerci&s;e any juri&s;diction over her, and
only entered into her cau&s;e by her own con&s;ent and approbation, &s;he
declined ju&s;tifying her&s;elf, when her honour, which ought to have been
dearer to her than life, &s;eemed ab&s;olutely to require it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The trial.</NOTE> ON her fir&s;t appearance
before the commi&s;&s;ioners, Mary, either &s;en&s;ible of her imprudence, or
&s;till unwilling to degrade her&s;elf by &s;ubmitting to a trial, renewed her
prote&s;tation again&s;t the authority of her judges: The chancellor an&s;wered
her by pleading the &s;upreme authority of the Engli&s;h laws over every one
who re&s;ided in England: And the commi&s;&s;ioners accommodated matters, by
ordering both her prote&s;tation and his an&s;wer to be recorded.</P>
<P>THE lawyers of the crown then opened the charge again&s;t the
Queen of Scots. They proved, by intercepted letters, that &s;he had allowed
cardinal Allen and others to treat her as Queen of England; and that &s;he had
kept a corre&s;pon|dence with lord Paget and Charles Paget, in a view of
engaging the Spaniards to invade the kingdom. Mary &s;eemed not a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">xious to clear her&s;elf from either of
the&s;e imputations. She only &s;aid, that &s;he could not hinder others from
u&s;ing what &s;tyle they plea&s;ed in writing to her; and that it was lawful
for her to em|ploy every expedient for the recovery of her liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="602" REF="207"> AN intercepted letter of her's to Mendoza
was next produced; in which &s;he pro|mi&s;ed to transfer to Philip her right
to the kingdom of England, if her &s;on &s;hould refu&s;e to be converted to
the catholic faith; an event, &s;he &s;aid, of which there was no expectation,
while he remained in the hands of his Scotch &s;ubjects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 138.</NOTE>. Even this part of the
charge, &s;he took no pains to deny, or rather &s;he &s;eemed to ac|knowledge
it. She &s;aid, that &s;he had no kingdoms to di&s;po&s;e of; yet was it
law|ful for her to give at her plea&s;ure what was her own, and &s;he was not
accountable to any for her actions. She added, that &s;he had formerly rejected
that propo&s;al from Spain, but now, &s;ince all her hopes in England were
gone, &s;he was fully determined not to refu&s;e foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
There was al&s;o produced evidence to prove, that Allen and Par&s;ons were at
that very time negotiating by her or|ders in Rome the conditions of
transferring her Engli&s;h crown to the King of Spain, and of di&s;inheriting
her heretical &s;on<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Canden, p. 525. This
evidence was that of Curle, her &s;ecretary, whom &s;he allowed to be a very
hone&s;t man; and who as well as Nau, had given proofs of his integrity, by
keeping &s;o long &s;uch important &s;ecrets, from who&s;e di&s;covery he could
have reaped the greate&s;t profit. Mary, after all, thought that &s;he had &s;o
little rea&s;on to complain of Curle's evidence, that &s;he took care to have
him paid a con&s;iderable &s;um by her te&s;tament, which &s;he wrote the day
before her death. Coodal, vol. I. p. 413. Neither did &s;he forget Nau, tho'
le&s;s &s;atisfied with his conduct. Id. Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that Mary's prejudices again&s;t her &s;on
were, at this time, carried &s;o far, that &s;he had even entered into a
con&s;piracy again&s;t him, had ap|pointed lord Claude Hamilton regent of
Scotland, and had in&s;tigated her adhe|rents to &s;eize the King's per&s;on
and deliver him into the hands of the pope or the King of Spain; whence he was
never to be delivered but on the condition of his becoming catholic<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>The detail of this con&s;piracy is to be found in a letter
of the Queen of Scots to Charles Paget, her great con&s;ident. This letter is
dated the 20th of May 1586, and is contained in Dr.

beyond que&s;tion is, that we find in Murden's Collection, p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">10, that Mary actually wrote that

that Charles Paget did actually write her a letter of that date.</P> 
<P>This violence of &s;pirit is very con&s;i&s;tent with Mary's
character. Her maternal affection was too weak to oppo&s;e the gratification of
her pa&s;&s;ions, particularly her pride, her ambition, and her bigotry. Her

account of the prejudices of his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, at la&s;t
de&s;i&s;ted from that de&s;ign, and entered into an alliance with England,
without comprehending his mother. She was in &s;uch a rage at this undutiful
behaviour, as &s;he imagined it, that &s;he wrote to Queen Elizabeth, that
&s;he no longer cared what became of him or her in the world; the greate&s;t
&s;atisfaction &s;he could have before her death was to &s;ee him and all his
adherents become a &s;ignal example of tyranny, ingratitude and impiety, and
undergo the vengeance of God for their wickedne&s;s. She would &s;ind in
Chri&s;ter|dom other heirs, and doubted not to put her inheritance in &s;uch
hands as would retain the firme&s;t hold of it. She cared not, after taking
this revenge, what became of her body: The quicke&s;t death would then be the
mo&s;t agreeable to her. And &s;he a&s;&s;ured her, that, if he per&s;evered,
&s;he would di&s;own him for her &s;on, would give him her malediction, would
di&s;inherit him, as well of his pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions as of all he
could expect by her; abandoning him not only to her &s;ubjects to treat him as
they had done her, but to all &s;trangers to &s;ubdue and conquer him. It was
in vain to employ menaces again&s;t her: The fear of death or other misfortune
would never induce her to make one &s;tep or pro|nounce one &s;yllable beyond
what &s;he had determined: She would rather peri&s;h with honour, in
main|taining the dignity, to which God had rai&s;ed her, than degrade her&s;elf
by the lea&s;t pu&s;illanimity, or act what was unworthy of her &s;tation and

<P><PB N="603" REF="208"> THE only part of the charge, which Mary
po&s;itively denied, was her concur|rence in the de&s;ign of
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Queen Elizabeth: This article indeed was the mo&s;t
heavy, and the only one, which could fully ju&s;tify the Queen in proceeding to
extremities again&s;t her. In order to prove the accu&s;ation, there were
pro|duced the following evidence: Copies taken in &s;ecretary Wal&s;ingham's
office of the intercepted letters between her and Babington, in which her
approbation of the murder was clearly expre&s;&s;ed; the evidence of her two
&s;ecretaries, Nau and Curle, who had &s;worn, without being put to any
torture, that &s;he both received the&s;e letters from Babington, and that they
had wrote the an&s;wers by her order; the confe&s;&s;ion of Babington, that he
had wrote the letters and received the an|&s;wers<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 113.</NOTE>; and the confe&s;&s;ion of
Ballard and Savage, that Babington had &s;howed them the&s;e letters of Mary,
wrote in the cypher, which had been &s;ettled between them.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that this &s;eeming complication of evidence
re&s;olves it&s;elf finally into the te&s;timony of the two &s;ecretaries, who
alone were acquainted with their mi&s;tre&s;s's concurrence in Babington's
con&s;piracy, and who knew them&s;elves ex|po&s;ed to all the rigours of
impri&s;onment, torture and death, if they refu&s;ed to give any evidence,
which might be required of them. In the ca&s;e of an ordi|nary 
<PB N="604" REF="209"> criminal, this proof, with all its di&s;advantages,
would be e&s;teemed legal, and even &s;atisfactory, if not oppo&s;ed by &s;ome
other circum&s;tances, which &s;hake the credit of the witne&s;&s;es: But on
the pre&s;ent trial, where the ab&s;olute power of the pro&s;ecutor concurred
with &s;uch important intere&s;ts and &s;uch a &s;trong incli|nation to have
the prince&s;s condemned; the te&s;timony of two witne&s;&s;es, even tho' men
of character, ought to be &s;upported by very &s;trong circum&s;tances, in
order to remove all &s;u&s;picion of tyranny and inju&s;tice. The proof
again&s;t Mary, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, is not de&s;titute of this
advantage; and it is very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to account for
Babington's receiving an an&s;wer, wrote in her name, and in the cypher
concerted between them, without allowing, that the matter had been communicated
to that prince&s;s. Such is the light in which this matter appears, even after
time has di&s;covered every thing, which could guide our judg|ment with regard
to it: No wonder, therefore, that the Queen of Scots, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by
council, and confounded by &s;o extraordinary a trial, found her&s;elf
incapable of making a &s;atisfactory defence before the commi&s;&s;ioners. Her
reply con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in her own denial: Whatever force may be in that
denial was much weakened, by her po&s;itively affirming, that &s;he never had
had any corre&s;pondence of any kind with Babington; a fact, however, of which
there remains not the lea&s;t que&s;tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The volume of
State Papers collected by Mr. Murden, prove beyond controver&s;y, that Mary was
long in clo&s;e corre&s;pondence with Babington, p. 513, 516, 532, 533. She
entertained a like cor|re&s;pondence with Ballard, Morgan, and Charles Paget,
and laid a &s;cheme with them for an in&s;ur|rection, and for the inva&s;ion of
England by Spain, p. 528, 531. The &s;ame papers &s;how, that there had been a
di&s;continuance of Babington's corre&s;pondence, agreeable to Camden's
narration. See State Papers p 513, where Morgan recommends it to Queen Mary to
renew the corre&s;pondence with Babington. The former letters, which pa&s;&s;ed
between that Queen and Babington, &s;eem to have been de&s;troyed by &s;ome
accident. The&s;e circum&s;tances prove, that no weight can be laid on Mary's
denial of guilt, and that her corre&s;pondence with Babington contained
particulars, which could not be avowed.</NOTE>. She a&s;&s;erted, that as Nau
and Curle had taken an oath of &s;ecrecy and fidelity to her, their evidence
again&s;t her ought not to be credited. She confe&s;&s;ed, however, that Nau
had been in the &s;ervice of her uncle, the cardinal of Lorraine, and had been
recommended to her by the King of France, as a man in whom &s;he might &s;afely
confide. She al&s;o acknowleged Curle to be a very hone&s;t man, but &s;imple,
and ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on by Nau. If the&s;e two men had received any letters,
or had wrote any an&s;wers, without her knowlege; the imputation, &s;he &s;aid,
could never lie on her. And &s;he was the more inclined, &s;he added, to
enter|tain this &s;u&s;picion again&s;t them, that Nau had, in other
in&s;tances, been guilty of a <PB N="605" REF="210"> like temerity, and had
ventured to tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s in her name, without com|municating the
matter to her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>There are three &s;uppo&s;itions, by which the letter to
Babington may be accounted for, without allowing Mary's concurrence in the
con&s;piracy for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Elizabeth. The fir&s;t is, that which
&s;he &s;eems her&s;elf to have embraced, that her &s;ecretaries had received
Babington's letter, and had ventured of them&s;elves to an&s;wer it, without
communicating the matter to her: But it is utterly improbable, that a
prince&s;s of that &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit would, in an affair of that
importance, be &s;o treated by her &s;er|vants, who lived in the hou&s;e with
her, and who had every moment an opportunity of communicating the &s;ecret to
her. If the con&s;piracy failed, they mu&s;t expect to &s;uffer the
&s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment from the court of England; if it &s;ucceeded, the
lighte&s;t puni&s;hment, which they could hope for from their own mi&s;tre&s;s,
mu&s;t be di&s;grace, on account of their temerity. Not to mention, that Mary's
concur|rence was in &s;ome degree requi&s;ite for effectuating the de&s;ign of
her e&s;cape: It was propo&s;ed to attack her guards, while &s;he was employed
in hunting: She mu&s;t therefore concert the time and place with the
con&s;pirators. The &s;econd &s;uppo&s;ition is, that the&s;e two &s;ecretaries
were previou&s;ly traitors; and being gained by Wal&s;ingham, had made &s;uch a
reply in their mi&s;tre&s;s's cypher, as might involve her in the guilt of the
con&s;piracy. But the&s;e two men had lived long with the Queen of Scots, had
been entirely tru&s;ted by her, and had never fallen under &s;u&s;picion either
with her or her partizans. Camden tells us, that Curle afterwards claimed a
reward from Wal&s;ingham on pretence of &s;ome promi&s;e; but Wal&s;ingham told
him, that he owed him no reward, and that he had made no di&s;coveries on his
exa|mination, which were not known with certainty from other quarters. The
third &s;uppo&s;ition is, that neither the Queen nor the two &s;ecretaries, Nau
and Curle, ever &s;aw Babington's letter, or made any an&s;wer; but that
Wal&s;ingham, having decyphered the former, forged a reply. But this
&s;uppo&s;ition implies the fal&s;hood of the whole &s;tory, told by Camden, of
Gifford's acce&s;s to the Queen of Scots's family, and Paulet's re&s;u&s;al to
concur in allowing his &s;ervants to be bribed. Not to mention, that as Nau's
and Curle's evidence mu&s;t, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, have been extorted by
violence and terror, they would nece&s;&s;arily have been engaged, for their
own ju&s;tification, to have told the truth afterwards; e&s;pecially upon the
acce&s;&s;ion of James. But Camden informs us, that Nau, even after that event,
per&s;i&s;ted &s;till in his te&s;timony.</P> 
<P>We mu&s;t al&s;o con&s;ider, that the two la&s;t
&s;uppo&s;itions imply &s;uch a mon&s;trous criminal conduct in Wal&s;ingham,
and con&s;equently in Elizabeth (for the matter could be no &s;ecret to her) as
exceeds all credibility. If we con&s;ider the &s;ituation of things and the
prejudices of the times, Mary's con&s;ent to Babington's con&s;piracy appears
much more natural and probable. She believed Elizabeth to be an u&s;urper and a
heretic: She regarded her as a per&s;onal and a violent enemy: She knew that
&s;chemes of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating heretics were very familiar in that age, and
generally approved of by the zealous ca|tholics: Her own liberty and
&s;overeignty were connected with the &s;ucce&s;s of this enterprize: And it
cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ppear &s;trange, that where
men of &s;o much merit as Babington could be engaged, by bigotry alone, in &s;o
criminal an enterprize, Mary, who was actuated by the &s;ame motive, joined to
&s;o many others, &s;hould have given her con&s;ent to a &s;cheme projected by
her friends. We may be previ|ou&s;ly certain, that, if &s;uch a &s;cheme was
ever communicated to her, with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he would
a&s;&s;ent to it: And it &s;erved the purpo&s;e of Wal&s;ingham and the
Engli&s;h mini&s;try to facilitate the communication of the&s;e &s;chemes, as
&s;oon as they had got an expedient &s;or intercepting her an&s;wer, and
detecting the con&s;piracy. Now Wal&s;ingham's knowlege of the matter is a
&s;uppo&s;ition nece&s;&s;ary to account for the letter delivered to
Babington.</P> 
<P>As to the not puni&s;hing of Nau and Curle by Elizabeth, it
never is the practice to puni&s;h le&s;&s;er criminals, who had given evidence
again&s;t the principal.</P> 
<P>But what &s;hould induce us to reject the&s;e three
&s;uppo&s;itions, is, that they mu&s;t, all of them, be con|&s;idered as bare
po&s;&s;ibilities: The partizans of Mary can give no rea&s;on for preferring
one to the other: Not the &s;lighte&s;t evidence ever appeared to &s;upport any
one of them: Neither at that time, nor at any time after, was any rea&s;on
di&s;covered, by the numerous zealots at home and abroad who had embraced
Mary's defence, to lead us to the belief o&s; any of the&s;e three
&s;uppo&s;itions; and even her apologi&s;ts at pre&s;ent &s;eem not to have
fixed on any choice among the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;ibilities. The
po&s;itive proof of two credible witne&s;&s;es, &s;upported by the other very
&s;trong circum&s;tances, &s;till remains unimpeached. Babington, who had an
extreme intere&s;t to have communication with the Queen of Scots, believed he
had found a means of corre&s;pondence with her, and had received an an&s;wer
from her: He, as well as the other con&s;pirators, died in that belief: There
has not occurred, &s;ince that time, the lea&s;t argument to prove they were
mi&s;taken: Can there be any rea&s;on at pre&s;ent to doubt of the truth of
their opinion? Camden, tho' a profe&s;t apologi&s;t for Mary, is con&s;trained
to tell the &s;tory in &s;uch a manner as evidently &s;uppo&s;es her guilt.
Such was the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;inding any other con&s;i&s;tent account,
even by a man of parts, who was a contemporary!</P> 
<P>In this light might the que&s;tion have appeared even during
Mary's trial. But what now puts her guilt beyond all controver&s;y is the
following pa&s;&s;age of her letter to Thomas Morgan, dated the 27th of July
1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">86. 
<Q REND="inline">"As to Babington, he hath both kindly and
hone&s;tly offered him&s;elf and all his means to be employed any way I would.
Whereupon I hope to have &s;atisfied him by two of my &s;everal letters,
&s;ince I had his; and the rather, for that I opened him the way, whereby I
received his with your afore&s;aid."</Q> Murden, p. 533. Babington
confe&s;&s;ed, that he had offered her to a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inate the Queen: It
appears by this, that &s;he had accepted the offer: So that all the
&s;uppo&s;itions of Wal&s;ingham's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">gery, or her &s;ecretary's temerity or treachery, &s;all to the
ground.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;ole circum&s;tance of her defence, which to us may appear
to have &s;ome force, was her requiring that Nau and Curle &s;hould be
confronted with her, and <PB N="606" REF="211"> affirming that they never would
to her face per&s;i&s;t in their evidence. But that de|mand, however equitable,
was not &s;upported by law in trials of high trea&s;on, and was often refu&s;ed
even in other trials where the crown was pro&s;ecutor. The clau&s;e, contained
in an act of the 13th of the Queen, was a novelty; that the &s;pecies of
trea&s;on there enumerated mu&s;t be proved by two witne&s;&s;es, confronted
with the criminal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The law of 5 &amp; 6 of Edward VI.
cap. 11. which required the confrontation of two witne&s;&s;es for all
&s;pecies of trea&s;on was repealed in the fir&s;t of Mary.</NOTE>. But Mary
was not tried upon that act; and the mini&s;ters and crown lawyers of this
reign were always &s;ure to refu&s;e every indulgence beyond what the &s;trict
letter of the law and the &s;ettled practice of the courts of ju&s;tice
required of them. Not to mention, that the&s;e &s;ecretaries were not probably
at Fotherin|gay during the time of the trial, and could not, upon Mary's
demand, be pro|duced by the commi&s;&s;ioners<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Queen Elzabeth was willing to have allowed Curle and Nau to be
produced in the trial, and writes to that purpo&s;e, to Burleigh and

She only &s;ays, that &s;he thinks it needle&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, tho' &s;he was willing to agree to it. The not con&s;ionting the

de&s;ign, but the practice of the age.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="607" REF="212"> THERE pa&s;&s;ed two incidents in this
trial, which may be worth ob&s;erving. A letter between Mary and Babington was
read, in which mention was made of the earl of Arundel and his brothers: On
hearing their names &s;he broke into a &s;igh, 
<Q REND="inline">"Alas," &s;aid &s;he, "what has that noble
hou&s;e of the Howards &s;uffered for my &s;ake!"</Q> She affirmed, with regard
to the &s;ame letter, that it was ea&s;y to forge the hand-writing and cypher
of another; &s;he was afraid, that this was too familiar a practice with
Wal&s;ingham, who, &s;he al&s;o heard, had frequently prac|ti&s;ed both
again&s;t her life and her &s;on's. Wal&s;ingham, who was one of the
com|mi&s;&s;ioners, ro&s;e up when he heard this accu&s;ation. He prote&s;ted,
that in his private capacity, he had never acted any thing again&s;t the Queen
of Scots: In his pub|lic capacity, he owned, that his concern for his
&s;overeign's &s;afety had made him very diligent in &s;earching out, by every
expedient, all de&s;igns again&s;t her &s;acred per&s;on or her authority. For
attaining that end, he would not only make u&s;e of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
Ballard or any other con&s;pirator: He would al&s;o reward them for betraying
their companions. But if he had tampered in any manner, unworthy of his
character and office, why did none of the late criminals either at their trial
or execution, accu&s;e him of &s;uch practices? Mary endea|voured to pacify him
by &s;aying that &s;he &s;poke from information; and &s;he begged him, that he
would thenceforth give no more credit to &s;uch as &s;tandered her, than &s;he
would to &s;uch as accu&s;ed him. The great character indeed, which Sir Francis
Wal&s;ingham bears for probity and honour, &s;hould remove from him all
&s;u&s;picion of &s;uch ba&s;e arts as forgery and &s;ubornation; arts, which
even the mo&s;t corrupt mini&s;ters in the mo&s;t corrupt times would &s;cruple
to employ.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25th October.</NOTE> HAVING fini&s;hed the
trial, the commi&s;&s;ioners adjourned from Fotheringay, and met in the
Star-Chamber at London; where, after taking the oaths of Mary's two
&s;ecretaries, who, voluntarily, without hope or reward, vouched the
authenticity of tho&s;e letters before produced, they pronounced &s;entence of
death upon the Queen of Scots, and confirmed it by their &s;eals and
&s;ub&s;criptions. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sentence a|gain&s;t Mary.</NOTE> The &s;ame

<P>THE Queen had now brought her affairs with Mary to that
&s;ituation, which &s;he had long ardently de&s;ired; and had &s;ound a
plau&s;ible rea&s;on for executing vengeance on a competitor, whom, from the
beginning of her reign, &s;he had <PB N="608" REF="213"> ever equally dreaded
and hated. But &s;he was re&s;trained from gratifying in&s;tantly her
re&s;entment, by &s;everal important con&s;iderations. She fore&s;aw the
invidious colours in which this example of uncommon juri&s;diction would be
repre&s;ented by the numerous partizans of Mary, and the reproach, to which
&s;he her&s;elf might be expo&s;ed with all foreign princes, perhaps with all
po&s;terity. The rights of ho&s;pitality, of kindred, and of royal maje&s;ty,
&s;eemed in one &s;ignal in&s;tance to be all violated; and this &s;acrifice of
genero&s;ity to intere&s;t, of clemency to re|venge, might appear equally
unbecoming a &s;overeign and a woman. Elizabeth, therefore, who was an
excellent hypocrite, pretended the utmo&s;t reluctance to proceed to the
execution of the &s;entence, affected the mo&s;t tender &s;ympathy with her
pri&s;oner, di&s;played all her &s;cruples and objections, rejected the
&s;ollicitation of her courtiers and mini&s;ters, and affirmed, that, were
&s;he not moved by the deepe&s;t concern for her people's &s;afety, &s;he would
not he&s;itate a moment in pardoning all the injuries, which &s;he her&s;elf
had received from the Queen of Scots.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">29th October.</NOTE> THAT the voice of her
people might be more audibly heard in the demand of ju&s;tice upon Mary, &s;he
&s;ummoned a new Parliament; and &s;he knew, both from the u&s;ual
di&s;po&s;itions of that a&s;&s;embly, and from the influence of her
mini&s;ters over them, that &s;he &s;hould not want the mo&s;t earne&s;t
&s;ollicitation to con&s;ent to that mea&s;ure, which was &s;o agreeable to her
&s;ecret inclinations. She opened not this a&s;&s;embly in per&s;on, but
appointed for that purpo&s;e three commi&s;&s;ioners, the chancellor Bromley,
the trea&s;urer Burleigh, and the earl of Derby. The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for
this mea&s;ure, was, that the Queen, fore&s;eeing that the affair of the Queen
of Scots would be tried in Parliament, found her tenderne&s;s and delicacy &s;o
much hurt by that melancholy incident, that &s;he had not the courage to be
pre&s;ent while it was under deliberation, but withdrew her eyes from what
&s;he could not behold without the utmo&s;t reluctance and unea&s;ine&s;s. She
was al&s;o willing, that, by this unu&s;ual caution, the people &s;hould &s;ee
the danger, to which her per&s;on was hourly expo&s;ed; and &s;hould thence be
more &s;trongly incited to take vengeance on the criminal, who&s;e re&s;tle&s;s
intrigues and bloody con&s;piracies had &s;o long expo&s;ed her to the mo&s;t
imminent perils<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 375.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament an&s;wered the Queen's expectations: The
&s;entence again&s;t Mary was unanimou&s;ly rati&s;ied by both hou&s;es; and an
application was agreed on to obtain Elizabeth's con&s;ent to its publication
and execution<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 379.</NOTE>. She gave
them an an&s;wer ambiguous, embarra&s;&s;ed; full of real artifice, and
&s;eeming irre|&s;olution. She mentioned the extreme danger to which her life
was continually expo&s;ed; &s;he declared her willingne&s;s to die, did &s;he
not fore&s;ee the great cala|mities, <PB N="609" REF="214"> which would thence
fall upon the nation; &s;he made profe&s;&s;ions of the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s
to her people; &s;he di&s;played the clemency of her temper, and expre&s;&s;ed
her violent reluctance to proceed to extremity again&s;t her unhappy
kin&s;woman; &s;he affirmed, that the late law, by which that prince&s;s was
tried, &s;o far from being made to en&s;nare her, was only intended to give her
warning be|forehand, not to engage in &s;uch attempts, as might expo&s;e her to
the penalties, with which &s;he was thus openly menaced; and &s;he begged them
to think once again, whether it was po&s;&s;ible to find any other expedient
be&s;ides the death of the Queen of Scots for &s;ecuring the public
tranquillity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 402, 403.</NOTE>. The
Parliament, in obedience to her commands, took the affair again under
deliberation; but could find no other po&s;&s;ible expedient. They reiterated
their &s;ollicitations and entreaties and arguments: They even remon&s;trated,
that mercy to the Queen of Scots was cruelty to them, her &s;ubjects and
children: And they affirmed, that it were inju&s;|tice to deny execution of the
law to any individual; much more, to the whole bo|dy of the people, now
unanimou&s;ly and earne&s;tly &s;uing for this pledge of her paren|tal care and
tenderne&s;s. This &s;econd addre&s;s &s;et the pretended doubts and &s;cruples
of Elizabeth anew in agitation: She complained of her own unfortunate
&s;itua|tion; expre&s;&s;ed her unea&s;ine&s;s from their importunity; renewed
the profe&s;&s;ions of affection to her people; and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the

any of the griefs of this commonwealth what&s;oever touching the &s;ervice of

may be done unto God, and benefit and &s;ervice unto the prince and &s;tate,
without free &s;peech in this council that may be done with it? Whether there
be any council which can make, add, or dimini&s;h from the laws of the realm
but only this council of Parliament? Whether it be not again&s;t the orders of
this council to make any &s;ecret or matter of weight, which is here in hand
known to the prince or any other, concerning the high &s;ervice of God, prince

detained in cu&s;tody till the Queen thought &s;it to relea&s;e them. The&s;e

faint dawnings of the pre&s;ent Engli&s;h con&s;titution; tho' &s;uddenly
eclip&s;ed by the arbitrary government of Elizabeth. Went|worth was indeed, by
his puritani&s;m, as well as his love of liberty (for the&s;e two characters,
of &s;uch unequal merit, aro&s;e and advanced together) the true forerunner of
the Hambdens, the Pyms, and the Holli&s;es, who, in the next age, with le&s;s
courage, becau&s;e with le&s;s danger, rendered their principles &s;o
triumphant. I &s;hall only a&s;k, whether it be not &s;ufficiently clear from

bereave her of it.</P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots wrote her la&s;t letter to Elizabeth; full of
dignity, with|out departing from that &s;pirit of meekne&s;s and of charity,
which appeared &s;uit|able to this concluding &s;cene of her unfortunate life.
She preferred no petition <PB N="612" REF="217"> for averting the fatal
&s;entence: On the contrary, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her gratitude to heaven for
thus bringing to a &s;peedy period her &s;ad and lamentable pilgrimage. She
reque&s;ted &s;ome favours of Elizabeth, and entreated her, that &s;he might be
beholden for them to her own goodne&s;s alone, without making applications to
tho&s;e mini&s;ters, who had di&s;covered &s;uch an extreme antipathy to her
per&s;on and her religion. She de&s;ired, that, after her enemies &s;hould be
&s;atiated with her innocent blood, her body, which, it was determined,
&s;hould never enjoy re&s;t, while her &s;oul was united to it, might be
con&s;igned to her &s;ervants, and be conveyed by them into France, there to
repo&s;e in a catholic land, with the &s;a|cred relicts of her mother. In
Scotland, &s;he &s;aid, the &s;epulchres of her ance&s;tors were violated, and
the churches either demoli&s;hed or profaned; and in England, where &s;he might
be interred among the antient kings, her own and Elizabeth's progenitors, &s;he
could entertain no hopes of being accompanied to the grave with tho&s;e rites
and ceremonies, which her religion required. She de&s;ired that no one might
have the power of inflicting a private death upon her, without Eliza|beth's
knowlege; but that her execution &s;hould be public, and attended with her
antient &s;ervants, who might bear te&s;timony of her per&s;everance in the
faith, and of her &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of heaven. She begged, that
the&s;e &s;ervants might afterwards be allowed to depart whither they
plea&s;ed, and might enjoy tho&s;e legacies which &s;he &s;hould leave them.
And &s;he conjured her to grant the&s;e favours, by their near kindred, by the
&s;oul and memory of Henry the &s;eventh, the common ance&s;tor of both, and by
the royal dignity of which they equally participated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 529. Jebb, vol. II. p. 295.</NOTE>. Elizabeth made no
an&s;wer to this letter; being unwilling to give Mary a refu&s;al in her

tho' that monarch might, from decency and policy, think him&s;elf obliged to
interpo&s;e publicly in behalf of the Queen of Scots, he could not &s;ecretly
be much di&s;plea&s;ed with the death of a prince&s;s, on who&s;e fortune and

interpo&s;ition of the young King of Scots, tho' it was not able to change
Elizabeth's determination, &s;eemed, on every account, to merit more
atten|tion. So &s;oon as James heard of the trial and condemnation of his
mother, he &s;ent William Keith, gentleman of his bed chamber, to London; and
wrote a letter to the Queen, in which he remon&s;trated, in very &s;evere
terms, again&s;t the indignity of the procedure. He &s;aid, that he was
a&s;toni&s;hed to hear of the pre|&s;umption of Engli&s;h noblemen and
councellors, who had dared to &s;it in judg|ment and pa&s;s &s;entence upon a
Queen of Scotland, de&s;cended from the royal blood of England; but was &s;till
more a&s;toni&s;hed to hear, that thoughts were &s;eriou&s;ly entertained of
putting that &s;entence in execution: That he entreated Elizabeth to reflect on
the di&s;honour, which &s;he would draw on her name, by embruing her hands in
the blood of her near kin&s;woman, a per&s;on of the &s;ame royal dignity and
the &s;ame &s;ex with her&s;elf: That in this unparalelled attempt, &s;he
offered an affront to all diadems, and even to her own; and by reducing
&s;o|vereigns to a level with other men, taught the people to neglect all duty
towards tho&s;e whom Providence had appointed to rule over them: That for his
part, he mu&s;t e&s;teem the injury and in&s;ult &s;o enormous, as to be
incapable of all attone|ment; nor was it po&s;&s;ible for him thenceforth to
remain on any terms of corre|&s;pondence with a per&s;on, who, without any
pretence of legal authority, had de|liberately inflicted an ignominious death
upon his parent: And that even if the &s;entiments of nature and duty did not
in&s;pire him with this purpo&s;e of venge|ance, his own honour required it of
him; nor could he ever acquit him&s;elf in the eyes of the world, if he did not

the&s;e applications; and &s;he replied in a like &s;train to the Scotch
amba&s;&s;adors. When &s;he afterwards reflected, that this earne&s;tne&s;s was
no more than what duty required of James, &s;he was pacified; but retained
&s;till her re&s;olution of proceeding to extremities again&s;t Mary<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 353.</NOTE>. It is believed, that the
ma&s;ter of Gray, gained by the enemies of that prince&s;s, gave &s;ecretly his
advice not to &s;pare her, and undertook at all adventures to pacify his
ma&s;ter. <PB N="614" REF="219"> The Queen al&s;o, from many circum&s;tances,
was induced to pay &s;mall attention to the applications of James, and to
di&s;regard all the efforts, which he could em|ploy in behalf of his mother.
She was well acquainted with his character and intere&s;ts, the factions which
prevailed among his people, and the inveterate hatred, which the zealous
prote&s;tants, particularly the preachers, bore to the Queen of Scots. The
pre&s;ent incidents put the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of the clergy in a full light.
James, ob&s;erving the fixed purpo&s;e of Elizabeth, ordered prayers to be
offered up for his mother in all the churches; and knowing the captious humour
of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, he took care that the form of the petition &s;hould
be mo&s;t cau|tious, as well as humane and charitable: 
<Q REND="inline">"That it might plea&s;e God to illumi|nate Mary
with the light of his truth, and &s;ave her from the apparent danger with which
&s;he was threatened."</Q> But excepting the King's own chaplains, and one
clergyman more, all the preachers refu&s;ed to pollute their churches by
pray|ers for a papi&s;t, and would not &s;o much as prefer a petition for her
conver&s;ion. James, unwilling or unable to puni&s;h this di&s;obedience, and
de&s;irous of giving the preachers an opportunity of amending their fault,
appointed a new day when prayers &s;hould be &s;aid for his mother; and that he
might at lea&s;t &s;ecure him&s;elf from any in&s;ult in his own pre&s;ence, he
de&s;ired the archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews to preach before him. In order to
di&s;appoint this purpo&s;e, the clergy in&s;tigated one Couper, a young man,
who had not yet received holy orders, to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pulpit
early in the morning, and to exclude the prelate. When the King came to church,
and &s;aw the pulpit occupied by Couper, he cal|led to him from his &s;eat, and
told him, that the place was de&s;tined for another; yet &s;ince he was there,
if he would obey the charge given, and remember the Queen in his prayers, he
might proceed to divine &s;ervice. The preacher replied, that he would do as
the &s;pirit of God &s;hould direct him. This an&s;wer &s;uffi|ciently
in&s;tructed James in his purpo&s;e; and he commanded him to leave the pulpit:
As Couper &s;eemed not di&s;po&s;ed to obey, the captain of the guard went to
pull him from his place; upon which the young man cried aloud, that this day
would be a witne&s;s again&s;t the King in the great day of the Lord; and he
denounced a woe upon the inhabitants of Edinburgh for permitting him to be
treated in that manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 354.</NOTE>. The
audience at fir&s;t appeared de&s;irous to take part with him; but the &s;ermon
of the prelate brought them over to a more dutiful and more humane
di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, when &s;ollicited, either by James or by foreign

pri|&s;oner. The courtiers, &s;en&s;ible that they could do nothing more
acceptable to her, than to employ per&s;ua&s;ion on this head, failed not to

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons for the execution of Mary.</NOTE>
They &s;aid, that the treatment of that prince&s;s in England had been, on her

&s;he had been governed by principles of equity, &s;he would not have refu&s;ed

allowing her to retire into France, or of re&s;toring her by force to her
throne, in oppo&s;ition to the prote&s;tants, and the Engli&s;h party in
Scotland, had obliged the Queen to detain her in England, till time &s;hould
offer &s;ome opportunity of &s;erving her, without danger to the kingdom, or to
the prote&s;tant religion: That her u&s;age had there been &s;uch as became her

Queen's equal in rank and dignity, &s;elf-defence was permitted by a law of
nature, <PB N="616" REF="221"> which could never be abrogated; and every one,

rendering the life of the one the death of the other, pointed out to Elizabeth
the path, which either regard to &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, or to the happine&s;s

<P>HER care of her &s;ervants was the &s;ole remaining affair which
employed her concern in this world. She peru&s;ed her will, in which &s;he had
provided for them by legacies: She ordered the inventory of her goods, cloaths,
and jewels to be brought her; and &s;he wrote down the names of tho&s;e to whom
&s;he bequeathed each particular: To &s;ome &s;he di&s;tributed money with her
own hands; and &s;he adapted the recompence to their different degrees of rank
and merit. She wrote al&s;o letters of recommendation for her &s;ervants to the
French King, and to her cou&s;in the duke of Gui&s;e, whom &s;he made the chief
executor of her te&s;ta|ment. At her wonted time &s;he went to bed, &s;lept
&s;ome hours; and then ri&s;ing, &s;pent the re&s;t of the night in prayer.
Having fore&s;een the difficulty of exerci&s;ing the rites of her religion,
&s;he had had the precaution to obtain a con&s;ecrated ho&s;t from the hands of
pope Pius, and &s;he had re&s;erved the u&s;e of it for this la&s;t pe|riod of
her life. By this expedient &s;he &s;upplied, as much as &s;he could, the want
of a prie&s;t and confe&s;&s;or, who was refu&s;ed her<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 489.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the morning &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in a rich habit
of &s;ilk and velvet, the only one which &s;he had re&s;erved to her&s;elf. She
told her maids, that &s;he would willingly have left them this dre&s;s rather
than the plain garb which &s;he wore the day before: But it was nece&s;&s;ary
for her to appear at the en&s;uing &s;olemnity in a de|cent habit.</P>
<P>THOMAS Andrews, &s;heriff of the county, entered the room, and
informed her, that the hour was come, and that he mu&s;t attend her to the
place of execu|tion. She replied, that &s;he was ready; and bidding adieu to
her &s;ervants, &s;he leaned <PB N="619" REF="224"> on two of Sir Amias
Paulet's guards, becau&s;e of an infirmity in her limbs; and &s;he followed the
&s;heriff with a &s;erene and compo&s;ed a&s;pect. In pa&s;&s;ing thro' a hall
adjoining to her chamber, &s;he was met by the earls of Shrew&s;bury and Kent,
Sir Amias Paulet, Sir Drue Drury, and many other gentlemen of di&s;tinction.
Here &s;he al&s;o found Andrew Melvil, her &s;teward, who flung him&s;elf on
his knees before her; and, wringing his hands, cried aloud: 
<Q REND="inline">"Ah! madam! unhappy me! What man was ever before
the me&s;&s;enger of &s;uch heavy tidings as I mu&s;t carry, when I &s;hall
return to my native country, and &s;hall report, that I &s;aw my gracious Queen
and Mi&s;tre&s;s beheaded in England?"</Q> His tears prevented further
&s;peech; and Mary too felt her&s;elf moved, more from &s;ympathy than
af|fliction. 
<Q REND="inline">"Cea&s;e, my good &s;ervant," &s;aid &s;he,
"cea&s;e to lament: Thou ha&s;t cau&s;e rather to rejoice than to mourn: For
now &s;halt thou &s;ee the troubles of Mary Stuart receive their long expected
period and determination."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Know," continued &s;he, "good &s;ervant, that
all the world at be&s;t is vanity, and &s;ubject &s;till to more &s;orrow than
a whole ocean of tears is able to bewail. But I pray thee, carry this
me&s;&s;age from me, that I die a true woman to my religion, and unalterable in
my affections to Scotland and to France. Heaven forgive them, that have long
de&s;ired my end, and have thir&s;ted for my blood as the hart panteth after
the water brooks."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"O God," added &s;he, "thou that art the author
of truth and truth it&s;elf, thou knowe&s;t the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of my
heart: Thou knowe&s;t, that I was ever de&s;irous to pre&s;erve an entire union
between Scotland and England, and to obviate the &s;ource of all the&s;e fatal
di&s;cords. But recommend me, Melvil, to my &s;on, and tell him, that
notwith&s;tanding all my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, I have done nothing prejudicial to
the &s;tate and kingdom of Scotland."</Q> After the&s;e words, reclining
her&s;elf, with weeping eyes, and face bedewed with tears, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed
him. 
<Q REND="inline">"And &s;o," &s;aid &s;he, "good Melvil,

<P>SHE then turned about to the noblemen who attended her, and made
a peti|tion in behalf of her &s;ervants, that they might be well treated, that
they might be allowed to enjoy the pre&s;ents which &s;he had made them, and be
&s;ent &s;afely into their own country. Having received a favourable an&s;wer,
&s;he moved another re|que&s;t, that they might be permitted to attend her at
her death: In order, &s;aid &s;he, that their eyes may behold, and their hearts
bear witne&s;s, how patiently their Queen and mi&s;tre&s;s can bear her
execution, and how con&s;tantly &s;he per&s;e|veres in her attachments to her
religion. The earl of Kent oppo&s;ed this de&s;ire, and told her, that they
would be apt, by their &s;peeches and cries, both to di&s;turb 
<PB N="620" REF="225"> her&s;elf and the &s;pectators: He was al&s;o
apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t they &s;hould practi&s;e &s;ome &s;uper&s;tition, unmeet
for him to &s;uffer; &s;uch as dipping their handkerchiefs in her blood: For
that was the in&s;tance which he made u&s;e of. 
<Q REND="inline">"My lord," &s;aid the Queen of Scots, "I will
give my word (altho' it be but dead) that they &s;hall not incur any blame in
any of the actions which you have named. But alas! poor &s;ouls! it would be a
great con&s;olation to them to bid their mi&s;tre&s;s farewel. And I hope,"
added &s;he, "that your mi&s;tre&s;s, being a maiden Queen, would vouch&s;afe,
in regard of womanhood, that I &s;hould have &s;ome of my own people about me
at my death. I know, that her maje&s;ty hath not given you any &s;uch &s;trict
command, but that you might grant me a reque&s;t of far greater courte&s;y,
even tho' I were a woman of much inferior rank to that which I bear."</Q>
Finding that the earl of Kent per&s;i&s;ted &s;till in his refu&s;al, her mind,
which had fortified it&s;elf again&s;t the terrors of death, was affected by
this circum&s;tance of indignity, for which &s;he was not prepared. 
<Q REND="inline">"I am cou&s;in to your Queen," cried &s;he, "and
de&s;cended from the blood-royal of Henry the &s;eventh, and a married Queen of
France, and an anointed Queen of Scotland."</Q> The commi&s;&s;ioners
perceiving how invidious their ob&s;tinacy would appear, con|ferred a little
together, and agreed, that &s;he might carry a few of her &s;ervants along with
her. She made choice of four men, and two maid-&s;ervants, for that
purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>SHE then pa&s;&s;ed into another hall, where was erected the
&s;caffold, covered with black; and &s;he &s;aw, with an undi&s;mayed
countenance, the two executioners, and all the preparations of death. The room
was crowded with &s;pectators, and no one was &s;o &s;teeled again&s;t all
&s;entiments of humanity, as not to be moved, when he reflected on her royal
dignity, con&s;idered the &s;urprizing train of her mi&s;|fortunes, beheld her
mild but inflexible con&s;tancy, recalled her amiable accom|pli&s;hments, or
&s;urveyed her beauties, which, tho' faded by years, and yet more by her
afflictions, &s;till di&s;covered them&s;elves in this fatal moment. Here the
war|rant for her execution was read to her; and during this ceremony &s;he was
&s;ilent, but &s;hewed, in her behaviour, an indifference and unconcern, as if
the bu&s;ine&s;s had no way regarded her. Before the executioners performed
their office, the dean of Peterborow &s;tepped forth; and tho' the Queen
frequently told him, that he needed not concern him&s;elf about her, that &s;he
was &s;ettled in the ancient catho|lic and Roman religion, and that &s;he meant
to lay down her life in defence of that faith; he &s;till thought it his duty
to per&s;i&s;t in his lectures and exhortations, and to endeavour her
conver&s;ion. He told her, that the Queen of England had in this moment &s;hewn
a tender care of her; and notwith&s;tanding the puni&s;hment ju&s;tly to be
inflicted on her, for her manifold tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, was determined to u&s;e 
<PB N="621" REF="226"> every expedient for &s;aving her &s;oul from that
de&s;truction with which it was &s;o nearly threatned: That &s;he was now
&s;tanding upon the brink of eternity, and had no other means of e&s;caping
endle&s;s perdition, but by repenting her former wickedne&s;s, by ju&s;tifying
the &s;entence pronounced again&s;t her, by acknowleging the Queen's favours,
and by exerting a true and lively faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: That the
&s;criptures were the only rule of doctrine, the merits of Chri&s;t the only
means of &s;alvation; and if &s;he tru&s;ted in the inventions or devices of
men, &s;he mu&s;t expect in a moment to fall into utter darkne&s;s, into a
place where &s;hall be weep|ing, howling, and gna&s;hing of teeth: That the
hand of death was upon her, the ax was laid to the root of the tree, the throne
of the great judge of heaven was erected, the book of her life was &s;pread
wide, and the particular &s;entence and judgment was ready to be pronounced
upon her: And that it was now, during this important in&s;tant, in her choice,
either to ri&s;e to the re&s;urrection of life, and hear that joyful
&s;alutation, <HI>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father,</HI> or to &s;hare the
re&s;ur|rection of condemnation, replete with &s;orrow and grief; and to
&s;uffer that dread|ful denunciation, <HI>Go ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting

<P>DURING this di&s;cour&s;e the Queen could not forbear
&s;ometimes betraying her im|patience, by interrupting the preacher; and the
dean, finding that he had profited nothing by his lecture, at la&s;t bid her
change her opinion, repent her of her former wickedne&s;s, and &s;ettle her
faith upon this ground, that only in Chri&s;t Je&s;us could &s;he hope to be
&s;aved. She an&s;wered, again and again, with great earne&s;tne&s;s: 
<Q REND="inline">"Trouble not your&s;elf any more about the
matter: For I was born in this religion, I have lived in this religion, and in
this religion I am re&s;olved to die."</Q> Even the two earls perceived, that
it was fruitle&s;s to harra&s;s her any further with theological di&s;putes;
and they ordered the dean to de&s;i&s;t from his un&s;ea&s;onable exhortations,
and to pray for her conver&s;ion. During the dean's prayer, &s;he employed
her&s;elf in private devotion from the office of the Virgin; and after he had
fini&s;hed, &s;he pro|nounced aloud &s;ome petitions in Engli&s;h, for the
afflicted church, for an end of her own troubles, for her &s;on, and for Queen
Elizabeth; and prayed God, that that prince&s;s might long pro&s;per, and be
employed in his &s;ervice. The earl of Kent ob&s;erving, that in her devotions
&s;he made frequent u&s;e of the crucifix, could not forbear reproving her, for
her attachment to that popi&s;h trumpery, as he termed it; and he exhorted her
to have Chri&s;t in her heart, not in her hand<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">MS. p. 15. Jebb, vol. II. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">7, 491, 637.</NOTE>. She replied with pre&s;ence of mind, that it
was difficult to hold &s;uch an object in her hand, without feeling her heart
touched with &s;ome compunction<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jebb.

<P><PB N="622" REF="227"> SHE now began, with the aid of her two
women, to di&s;robe her&s;elf; and the executioner al&s;o lent his hand, to
a&s;&s;i&s;t them. She &s;miled, and &s;aid, that &s;he was not accu&s;tomed to
undre&s;s her&s;elf before &s;o large a company, nor to be &s;erv|ed by &s;uch
valets. Her &s;ervants, &s;eeing her in this condition, ready to lay her head
upon the block, bur&s;t into tears and lamentations: She turned about to them;
put her finger upon her lips, as a &s;ign of impo&s;ing &s;ilence upon
them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jebb, p. 307, 492.</NOTE>; and hav|ing given them
her ble&s;&s;ing, de&s;ired them to pray for her. One of her maids, whom &s;he

laid her&s;elf down, without any &s;ign of fear or trepidation; and her head
was &s;evered from her body at two &s;trokes by the executioner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mary's cha|racter.</NOTE> THUS died, in the
forty-&s;ixth year of her age, and the nineteenth of her cap|tivity in England,
Mary Queen of Scots; a prince&s;s of great accompli&s;hments both of body of
mind, natural as well as acquired; but unfortunate in her life, and during one
period, very unhappy in her conduct. The beauties of her per|&s;on, and of her
air, combined to make her the mo&s;t amiable of women; and the charms of her
addre&s;s and conver&s;ation aided the impre&s;&s;ion which her lovely figure
made on the hearts of all beholders. Ambitious and active in her temper, yet
inclined to chearfulne&s;s and &s;ociety; of a lofty &s;pirit, con&s;tant and
even vehe|ment in her purpo&s;e; yet polite, and gentle, and affable in her
demeanor; &s;he &s;eemed to partake only &s;o much of the male virtues as to
render her e&s;timable, with|out relinqui&s;hing tho&s;e &s;oft graces which

abandoned her&s;elf to the guidance of a profligate man; and mu&s;t con&s;ider
the&s;e faults, whether we admit them to be imprudences or crimes, as the
re&s;ult of an inexplicable, tho' not uncommon, incon&s;tancy in the human
mind, of the frailty of our nature, of the violence of pa&s;&s;ion, and of the
influence which &s;itu|ations, and &s;ometimes momentary incidents, have on
per&s;ons, who&s;e principles are not thoroughly confirmed by experience and
reflection. Enraged by the ungrate|ful conduct of her hu&s;band, &s;educed by
the treacherous coun&s;els of one in whom &s;he repo&s;ed confidence,
tran&s;ported by the violence of her own temper, which never lay &s;ufficiently
under the guidance of di&s;cretion; &s;he was betrayed into ac|tions, which
may, with &s;ome difficulty, be accounted for, but which admit of no apology,
nor even of alleviation. An enumeration of her qualities might carry the
appearance of a panegyric; an account of her conduct mu&s;t, in &s;ome parts,
wear the a&s;pect of a &s;evere &s;atire and invective.</P>
<P>HER numerous misfortunes, the &s;olitude of her long and tedious
captivity, and the per&s;ecutions to which &s;he had been expo&s;ed on account
of her religion, <PB N="623" REF="228"> had wrought her up to a degree of
bigotry during her latter years; and &s;uch was the prevalent &s;pirit and
principles of that age, that it is the le&s;s wonder, if her zeal, her
re&s;entment and her intere&s;t uniting, induced her to give con&s;ent to a

&s;he wi&s;hed he knew, but not felt, the unutterable grief of mind, &s;he
experienced, on account of that lamentable accident, which, without her

commit the relation of it to the me&s;&s;enger, her kin&s;man; who would
likewi&s;e inform his maje&s;ty of every circum&s;tance, which attended this
di&s;mal and unlooked for misfortune: That &s;he appealed to the Supreme Judge

other afflictions, as to find, that many per&s;ons in her court could bear
witne&s;s to her veracity in this prote&s;tation: That &s;he abhorred

That tho' &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of the ju&s;tice of the &s;entence, &s;he was

<P>IN order the better to appea&s;e James, &s;he committed
Davi&s;on to pri&s;on, and ordered him to be tried in the Star-Chamber for his
mi&s;demeanour. The &s;ecre|tary was confounded; and being &s;en&s;ible of the
danger, which mu&s;t attend his entering into a conte&s;t with the Queen, he
expre&s;&s;ed penitence for his error, and &s;ubmitted very patiently to be
railed at by tho&s;e very coun&s;ellors, who&s;e per&s;ua&s;ion had induced him
to incur the guilt, and who had promi&s;ed to countenance and protect him. He
was condemned to impri&s;onment during the Queen's plea&s;ure, and to pay a
fine of ten thou&s;and pounds. He remained a long time in pri&s;on; and the
fine, tho' it reduced him to want and beggary, was &s;trictly levied upon him.
All the favour, which he could obtain from the Queen, was the &s;ending him
&s;mall &s;upplies from time to time, to keep him from peri&s;hing in
nece&s;&s;ity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 538.</NOTE>. He privately
wrote an apology to his friend Wal&s;ingham, which contains many curious

remon&s;trating with the Queen in Mary's behalf; and immediately after their
departure, &s;he commanded him, of her own accord, to deliver her the warrant
for the execution of that prince&s;s. She &s;igned it readily and or|dered it
to be &s;ealed with the great &s;eal of England. She appeared in &s;uch good

that, tho' &s;he had &s;o long delayed the execution, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould
&s;eem to be actuated by malice or cruelty, &s;he was all along &s;en&s;ible of
the nece&s;&s;ity of it. In the &s;ame conver&s;ation, &s;he blamed Drury and
Paulet, that they had not before ea&s;ed her of this trouble; and &s;he
expre&s;&s;ed her de&s;ire that Wal&s;ingham would bring them to a compliance
in that particular. She was &s;o bent on this purpo&s;e, that, &s;ome time
after, &s;he a&s;ked Davi&s;on, whether any letter had come from Paulet with
regard to the &s;ervice expected of him. Davi&s;on &s;howed her Paulet's
letter; in which that gentleman flatly refu&s;ed to act any thing
incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of honour and ju&s;tice. The Queen fell
into a pa&s;&s;ion, and accu&s;ed Paulet, as well as Drury, of perjury, that,

to &s;end off the warrant. He was well aware of his danger, and remembered,
that the Queen, after having ordered the execution of the duke of Norfolk, had

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> WALSINGHAM wrote to lord Thirl&s;tone, the Scotch

&s;aid, that he was much &s;urprized to hear of the violent re&s;olutions taken

by any principles of equity or rea&s;on: That if the&s;e views were deemed
le&s;s mo|mentous among princes, policy and intere&s;t ought certainly to be
attended to; and the&s;e motives did &s;till more evidently oppo&s;e all
thoughts of a rupture with England, and all revival of expioded claims and
preten&s;ions to the Engli&s;h throne: That the inequality between the two

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters">ived James of any hopes of in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;s if he tru&s;ted merely to the
force of his own &s;late, and had no recour&s;e to foreign powers for
a&s;&s;i&s;tance: That the objections, attending the introduction 
<PB N="626" REF="231"> of &s;uccours from a more powerful monarch, appeared
&s;o evident from all the tran&s;actions of hi&s;tory, that they could not
e&s;cape a per&s;on of the King's exten&s;ive knowlege; but there were in the
pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;everal peculiar circum&s;tances, which ought for ever to
prevent him from having recour&s;e to &s;o dangerous an expe|dient: That the
French monarch, the antient ally of Scotland, might willingly u&s;e the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that kingdom again&s;t England; but would be di&s;plea&s;ed
to &s;ee the union of the&s;e two crowns on the head of James; an union, which
would ever after exclude him from all hopes of practicing that policy, formerly
&s;o u&s;eful to France and &s;o pernicious to the Scotch nation: That Henry,
be&s;ides, infe&s;ted with fac|tion and dome&s;tic war, was not in a condition
of &s;upporting di&s;tant allies; much le&s;s, would he undergo any hazard or
expence, in order to aggrandize a near kin&s;|man to the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e,
the mo&s;t determined enemies of his repo&s;e and authority: That the
exten&s;ive power and exorbitant ambition of the Spani&s;h monarch ren|dered
him a &s;till more dangerous ally to James; and as he evidently a&s;pired to an
univer&s;al monarchy in the we&s;t, and had in particular advanced &s;ome
claims on England, as if he were de&s;cended from the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter,
he was at the &s;ame time the common enemy of all princes, who de&s;ired to
maintain their li|berty and independance; and the immediate rival and
competitor of the King of Scots: That the Queen, by her own naval power, and
her alliance with the Hol|landers, would probably intercept all &s;uccours
which James might receive from abroad, and be enabled to decide the
controver&s;y in this i&s;land with the &s;uperior forces of her own kingdom,
oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e of Scotland: That if the King revived his mother's
preten&s;ions to the crown of England, he mu&s;t al&s;o embrace her religion,
by which alone they could be ju&s;tified; and mu&s;t thereby undergo the infamy
of abandoning tho&s;e principles, in which he had been &s;trictly educated, and
to which he had hitherto religiou&s;ly adhered: That as he would, by &s;uch an
apo&s;tacy, totally alienate all the prote&s;tants in Scotland and England, he
could never gain the confidence of the catholics, who would &s;till entertain a
very rea|&s;onable doubt of his honour and &s;incerity: That by advancing a
pre&s;ent claim to the crown, he forfeited the certain pro&s;pect of his
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and revived that national animo&s;ity, which the late peace
and alliance between the kingdoms had happily extingui&s;hed: That the whole
gentry and nobility of England had openly declared them&s;elves for the
execution of the Queen of Scots; and if James &s;howed &s;uch violent
re&s;entment again&s;t that act of ju&s;tice, they would be obliged, for their
own &s;ecurity, to prevent for ever &s;o implacable and revengeful a prince
from ruling over them: And that, however &s;ome per&s;ons might repre&s;ent his
honour as engaged to &s;eek vengeance for the pre&s;ent affront and injury, the
true honour of a prince con&s;i&s;ted in wi&s;dom and moderation and ju&s;tice,

<P>WHILE Elizabeth en&s;ured tranquillity from the attempts of her

to take &s;helter under the forts; he burned about an hundred ve&s;&s;els,
laden with ammunition and naval &s;tores; and he de&s;troyed a great &s;hip of

<P>THE land enterprizes of the Engli&s;h were not, during this
campaign, &s;o ad|vantageous or honourable to the nation. The important place
of Deventer was intru&s;ted by Leice&s;ter to William Stanley, with a
garri&s;on of twelve hundred Eng|li&s;h; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">his gentleman, being a catholic,
was alarmed with the di&s;covery of Babington's con&s;piracy, and became
apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t every one of his religion &s;hould thenceforth be
treated with di&s;tru&s;t in England. He entered into a corre|&s;pondence with
the Spaniards, betrayed the city to them for a &s;um of money, and engaged the
whole garri&s;on to de&s;ert with him to the Spani&s;h &s;ervice. Ro|land York,
who commanded a fort near Zutphen, imitated his example; and the Hollanders,
formerly di&s;gu&s;ted with Leice&s;ter, and &s;u&s;picious of the Engli&s;h,
broke out into loud complaints again&s;t the improvidence, if not the treachery
of his admini&s;tration. Soon after, he arrived him&s;elf in the Low Countries;
but his conduct was no-wi&s;e calculated to give them &s;atisfaction, or to
remove the &s;u&s;picions, which they had entertained again&s;t him. The prince
of Parma having be&s;ieged Sluys, he attempted to relieve the place, fir&s;t by
&s;ea, then by land; but failed in both enterprizes, and as he a&s;cribed his
bad &s;ucce&s;s to the ill behaviour of the Hollanders, they were equally free
in reflections upon his conduct. The breach between them became wider every
day: They &s;lighted his authority, op|po&s;ed his mea&s;ures, and neglected
his councils; while he endeavoured, by an im|perious behaviour, and by
violence, to recover that influence, which he had lo&s;t by his imprudent and
ill concerted mea&s;ures. He was even &s;u&s;pected by the Dutch of a de&s;ign
to u&s;urp upon their liberties; and the jealou&s;y entertained again&s;t him,
began to extend towards the Queen her&s;elf. That prince&s;s had made &s;ome
advances towards a peace with Spain: A congre&s;s had been opened at Bourbourg,
a village near G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aveline: And tho'
the two courts, e&s;pecially that of Spain, had no other intention than to
amu&s;e each of them its enemy by negotiation, and mutua ly relax the
preparations for defence or a&s;&s;ault, the Dutch, who were determined, on no
condition, to return under the Spani&s;h yoke, became appre|hen&s;ive le&s;t
their liberty &s;hould be &s;acrificed to the political intere&s;ts of
England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> part II. lib. 4. Strype, vol. IV.

knew the importance of her alliance with the &s;lates in the pre&s;ent
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> was re&s;olved to give them
entire &s;atisfaction by recalling

di&s;turbed by the malignity of Leice&s;ter, who had left a faction behind him,
and who &s;till attempted, by means of his emi&s;&s;aries, to di&s;turb all the
operations of the &s;lates. So &s;oon as Elizabeth got intelligence of the&s;e
di&s;orders, &s;he took care to redre&s;s them, and &s;he obliged all the
partizans of England to fall into una|nimity with prince Maurice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XV p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE>. But tho' her good &s;en&s;e &s;o far prevailed over her

for &s;ome time her confidence, and was even committed to cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>SIR Chri&s;topher Hatton was another favourite, who, at this
time, received &s;ome marks of her partiality. Tho' he had never followed the
profe&s;&s;ion of the law, he was made chancellor in the place of Bromley,
decea&s;ed; but notwith&s;tanding all the expectations and wi&s;hes of the
lawyers, he behaved in a manner not un|worthy that high &s;tation: His good
natural capacity &s;upplied the place of experience and &s;tudy; and his
deci&s;ions were not found deficient either in point of equity or judgment. His
enemies had contributed to this promotion, in hopes that his ab&s;ence from

while the power of that kingdom remained entire and unbroken. To &s;ubdue
England &s;eemed a nece&s;&s;ary preparative to the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of his
authority in the Netherlands; and notwith&s;tanding all ap|pearances, the
former was in it&s;elf, as a more important, &s;o a more ea&s;y, under|taking
than the latter. That kingdom lay nearer Spain than the Low Countries, and was
more expo&s;ed to inva&s;ions from that quarter; after an enemy had ob|tained
entrance, it was neither fortified by art nor nature; a long peace had
de|prived it of all military di&s;cipline and experience; and the catholics, in
which it &s;till abounded, would be ready to join any invader, who &s;hould
free them from tho&s;e grievous per&s;ecutions, at pre&s;ent exerci&s;ed
again&s;t them, and revenge the death of the Queen of Scots, on whom they had
fixed all their affections. The fate of England mu&s;t be decided in one battle
at &s;ea, and another at land; and what compari&s;on between the Engli&s;h and
Spaniards, either in point of naval force, or in the numbers, reputation, and
veteran bravery of their armies? Be|&s;ides the acqui&s;ition of &s;o great a

the Hollanders, who, attacked on every hand, and de|prived of all &s;upport,
mu&s;t yield their &s;tubborn necks to that yoke, which they had &s;o long
re&s;i&s;ted. Happily, this conque&s;t, as it was of the utmo&s;t impor|tance
to the grandeur of Spain, would not at pre&s;ent be oppo&s;ed by the jealou&s;y
of the neighbouring powers, naturally &s;o much intere&s;ted to prevent the

the empire was in the hands of a friend and near ally; and France, the

had no leizure to pay at|tention to her foreign intere&s;ts. This favourable

re&s;ounded with the noi&s;e of armaments, and all hismini&s;ters, generals,

Croce, a &s;ea officer of great reputation and experience, was de&s;tin|ed to
command the fleet; and by his coun&s;el were the naval equipments conducted In
all the ports of Sicily, of Naples, of Spain and Portugal, artizans were
em|ployed in building ve&s;&s;els of uncommon &s;ize and force; naval &s;tores
were bought up at a prodigious expence; provi&s;ions ama&s;&s;ed; armies levied
and quartered in the maritime towns of Spain; and plans laid for fitting out
&s;uch a fleet and em|barkation as had never before had its equal in Europe.
The military prepara|tions in Flanders were no le&s;s formidable. Forces from
all quarters were every moment a&s;&s;embling, to reinforce the duke of Parma.
Capizuchi and Spinelli, conducted forces from Italy: The marque&s;s of Borgaut,
a prince of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, levied troops in Germany: The Walloon and

a&s;&s;embled in the Netherlands, and kept in a readine&s;s to be tran&s;ported
into England. The duke of Parma em|ployed all the carpenters which he could
procure, either in Flanders or in Lower Germany, and the coa&s;ts of the
Baltic; and he built at Dunkirk, and Newport, but e&s;pecially at Antwerp, a
great number of boats and flat bottomed ve&s;&s;els, for the tran&s;port of his
infantry and cavalry into England. The mo&s;t renowned nobility and princes of

Queen demanded, were frankly granted by the per&s;ons applied to. Lord Howard
of Effingham, a man of great courage and capacity, was lord admiral, and took
on him the command of the navy: Drake, Hawkins, and Frobi&s;her, the mo&s;t
renowned &s;eamen in Europe, &s;erved under him. The main &s;leet was
&s;tationed at Plymouth. A &s;maller &s;qua|dron, con&s;i&s;ting of forty

&s;econd &s;on of protector Somer&s;et; and lay off Dunkirk, in or|der to
intercept the duke of Parma.</P>
<P>THE land forces of England, compared to tho&s;e of Spain,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed contrary qualities to its naval power: They were more
numerous than the enemy, but much inferior in di&s;cipline, reputation, and
experience. An army of twenty thou&s;and men was di&s;po&s;ed in different
bodies along the &s;outh coa&s;t; and orders were given them, if they could not
hinder the Spaniards from landing, to retire backwards, to wa&s;te the country
around, and to wait for reinforcement from the neighbouring counties, before
they approached the enemy. A body of twenty-two thou&s;and foot, and a
thou&s;and hor&s;e, under the command of the earl of Lei|ce&s;ter, was
&s;tationed at Tilbury, in order to defend the capital. The main army&punc;
con&s;i&s;ted of thirty-four thou&s;and foot, and two thou&s;and hor&s;e, and
was com|manded <PB N="633" REF="238"> by lord Hun&s;don. The&s;e forces were
re&s;erved for the guard of the Queen's per&s;on; and were appointed to march
whither&s;oever the enemy &s;hould appear. The fate of England, if the whole
Spani&s;h armies &s;hould be able to land, &s;eemed to depend on the i&s;&s;ue
of a &s;ingle battle; and men of reflection enter|tained the mo&s;t di&s;mal
apprehen&s;ions, when they con&s;idered the force of fifty thou&s;and veteran
Spaniards, commanded by experienced officers, under the duke of Parma, the
mo&s;t con&s;ummate general of the age; and compared this formid|able armament
with the military power which England, not enervated by peace&punc; but long
di&s;u&s;ed to war, could mu&s;ter up again&s;t it.</P>
<P>THE chief &s;upport of the kingdom &s;eemed to con&s;i&s;t in
the vigour and pru|dence of the Queen's conduct; who, undi&s;mayed by the
pre&s;ent dangers, i&s;&s;ued all her orders with tranquillity, animated her pe
ple to a &s;teddy re&s;i&s;tance, and employed every re&s;ource, which either
her dome&s;tic &s;ituation or her foreign alliances could afford her. She
&s;ent Sir Robert Sydney into Scotland; and ex|horted the King to remain
attached to her, and to con&s;ider the danger which at pre&s;ent menaced his
&s;overeignty no le&s;s than her own, from the ambition of the Spani&s;h

King of Denmark, and the tye of their common religion, engaged this prince,
upon her application, to &s;eize a &s;quadron of &s;hips which Philip had
bought or hired in the Dani&s;h harbours<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype,

Han&s;e Towns, tho' not at that time on good terms with England, were induced
by the &s;ame motives, to retard &s;o long the equipment of &s;ome ve&s;&s;els
in their ports, that they became u&s;ele&s;s to the pur|po&s;e of invading
England. All the prote&s;tants throughout Europe, regarded this enterprize as
the critical event which was to decide for ever the fate of their religion; and
tho' unable, by rea&s;on of their di&s;tance, to join their force to that of
Elizabeth, they kept their eyes fixed on her conduct and fortune, and beheld
with anxiety, mixed with admiration, the intrepid countenance with which &s;he
encountered that dreadful tempe&s;t, which was every moment approaching
to|wards her.</P>
<P>THE Queen al&s;o was &s;en&s;ible, that, next to the general
popularity which &s;he enjoyed, and the confidence which her &s;ubjects
repo&s;ed in her prudent govern|ment, <PB N="634" REF="239"> the firme&s;t
&s;upport of her throne con&s;i&s;ted in the general zeal of the people for the
prote&s;tant religion, and the &s;trong prejudices which they had imbibed
again&s;t popery. She took care, on this occa&s;ion, to revive in the nation
this at|tachment to their own &s;ect, and this abhorrence of the oppo&s;ite.
The Engli&s;h were reminded of their former danger from the tyranny of Spain:
All the bar|barities exerci&s;ed by Mary again&s;t the prote&s;tants, were
a&s;cribed to the coun&s;els of that bigotted and imperious nation: The bloody
ma&s;&s;acres in the Indies, the unrelenting executions in the Low Countries,
the horrid cruelties and iniquities of the inqui&s;ition, were &s;et before
men's eyes: A li&s;t and de&s;cription was pub|li&s;hed, and pictures
di&s;per&s;ed, of the &s;everal in&s;truments of torture with which, it was
pretended, the Spani&s;h Armada was loaded: And every artifice, as well as
rea&s;on, was employed, to animate the people to a vigorous defence of their
religion, their laws, and their liberties.</P>
<P>BUT while the Queen, in this critical emergence, rouzed the
animo&s;ity of the nation again&s;t popery, &s;he treated the partizans of that
&s;ect with moderation, and gave not way to an undi&s;tingui&s;hing fury
again&s;t them. Tho' &s;he knew, that Sixtus Quintus, the pre&s;ent pope,
famous for his capacity and his tyranny, had fulminated a new bull of
excommunication again&s;t her, had depo&s;ed her from the throne, had
ab&s;olved her &s;ubjects from their oaths of allegiance, had publi&s;h|ed a
croi&s;ade again&s;t England, and had granted plenary indulgence to every one
engaged in the pre&s;ent inva&s;ion; &s;he would not believe, that all her
catholic &s;ub|jects could be &s;o blinded, as to &s;acrifice to bigotry their
duty to their &s;overeign, and the liberty and independency of their native
country. She rejected all violent coun&s;els, by which &s;he was prompted to
&s;eek pretexts for di&s;patching the leaders of that party: She would not even
con&s;ine any con&s;iderable number of them: And the catholics, &s;en&s;ible of
this good u&s;age, generally expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t zeal for the public
defence. Some gentlemen of that &s;ect, con&s;cious that they could not
ju&s;tly expect any tru&s;t or authority, entered them&s;elves as volunteers in
the fleet or army<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 747.</NOTE>: Some equipped
&s;hips at their own charge, and gave the command of them to prote&s;tants:
Others were active in animating their tenants and va&s;&s;als, and neighbours,
to the defence of their country: And every rank of men, burying for the
pre&s;ent all party di&s;tinctions, &s;eemed to prepare them|&s;elves, with

<P>THE more to excite the martial &s;pirit of the nation, the Queen
appeared on hor&s;eback in the camp at Tilbury; and riding thro' the lines,
di&s;covered a chear|ful <PB N="635" REF="240"> and animated countenance,
exhorted the &s;oldiers to remember their duty to their country and their

<P>THE Spani&s;h Armada was ready on the beginning of May; but the
moment it was preparing to &s;ail, the marque&s;s of Santa Croce, the admiral,
was &s;eized with a violent fever, of which he &s;oon after died. The
vice-admiral, the duke of Paliano, by a &s;trange concurrence of accident, at
the very &s;ame time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> the
&s;ame fate; and the King appointed for admiral, the duke of Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ina Sidonia, the nobleman of the
greate&s;t family in Spain, but unexperienced in action, and utterly
unacquainted with &s;ea affairs. Alcarede was appointed vice-admiral. This
misfortune, be&s;ides the lo&s;s of &s;o great an officer as Santa Croce,
retarded the &s;ailing of the Armada, and gave the Engli&s;h more time for
their preparations to oppo&s;e them. At la&s;t, the fleet, full of hopes and
alacrity, &s;et &s;ail from Li&s;|bon; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> but next day met with a
violent tempe&s;t, which &s;cattered the &s;hips, &s;unk &s;ome of the
&s;malle&s;t, and forced the re&s;t to take &s;helter in the Groyne, where they
waited till they could be refitted. When news of this event was carried to 
<PB N="636" REF="241"> England, the Queen concluded, that the de&s;ign of an
inva&s;ion was di&s;appointed for this &s;ummer; and being always ready to lay
hold of every pretence for &s;aving money, &s;he made Wal&s;ingham write to the
admiral, directing him to lay up &s;ome of the larger &s;hips, and to
di&s;charge the &s;eamen: But lord Effingham, who was not &s;o &s;anguine in
his hopes, u&s;ed the freedom to di&s;obey the&s;e orders; and he beg|ed leave
to retain the whole &s;hips in &s;ervice, tho' it &s;hould be at his own
expence<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 545.</NOTE>. He took
advantage of a north wind, and &s;ailed towards the coa&s;t of Spain, with an
intention of attacking the enemy in their harbours; but the wind changing to
the &s;outh, he became apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t they might have &s;et &s;ail, and
by pa&s;&s;ing him at &s;ea, invade England, now expo&s;ed by the ab&s;ence of
the fleet. He re|turned, therefore, with the utmo&s;t expedition to Plymouth,
and lay at anchor in that harbour.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the Armada had repaired all her damages; and with
fre&s;h hopes &s;et out again to &s;ea, in pro&s;ecution of her enterprize. The
fleet con&s;i&s;ted of a hundred and thirty ve&s;&s;els, of which near a
hundred were galleons, and were of greater &s;ize than any which had ever
before been u&s;ed in Europe. It carried on board nineteen thou&s;and two
hundred and ninety-five &s;oldiers, eight thou&s;and four hundred and
fifty-&s;ix mariners, two thou&s;and and eighty-eight galley &s;laves, and two
thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty great pieces of bra&s;s ordnance. It was
victualled for &s;ix months; and was attended with twenty le&s;&s;er &s;hips,
called cara|vals, and ten &s;alves with &s;ix oars apiece<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. Appen. p. 221.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE plan formed by the King of Spain, was, that the Armada
&s;hould &s;ail to the coa&s;t oppo&s;ite to Dunkirk and Newport; and having
cha&s;ed away all Engli&s;h or Flemi&s;h ve&s;&s;els which might ob&s;truct the
pa&s;&s;age, (for it was never &s;uppo&s;ed they could make oppo&s;ition)
&s;hould join them&s;elves with the duke of Parma, &s;hould thence make &s;ail
to the Thames, and having landed the whole Spani&s;h army, thus compleat at one
blow the entire conque&s;t of England. In pro&s;ecution of this plan, Philip
gave orders to the duke of Medina, that, in pa&s;&s;ing along the chan+nel, he
&s;hould &s;ail as near the coa&s;t of France as he could with &s;afety; that
he &s;hould by this policy avoid meeting with the Engli&s;h fleet; and keeping
in view the main enterprize, &s;hould neglect all &s;maller &s;ucce&s;&s;es,
which might prove an ob&s;tacle, or even interpo&s;e a delay, to the
acqui&s;ition of a kingdom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on. p.
157.</NOTE>. After the Armada was under &s;ail, they took a fi&s;herman, who
informed them, that the Engli&s;h admiral had been lately at &s;ea, had heard
of the tempe&s;t which &s;cattered the Armada, had retired back into Plymouth,
and no longer expecting an inva|&s;ion this &s;ea&s;on, had laid up his
&s;hips, and di&s;charged mo&s;t of the &s;eamen. From <PB N="637" REF="242">
this fal&s;e intelligence the duke of Medina conceived the great facility of
attack|ing and de&s;troying the Engli&s;h &s;hips in harbour; and he was
tempted, by the pro&s;pect of &s;o deci&s;ive an enterprize, to break his
orders, and make &s;ail directly for Plymouth: A re&s;olution which proved the
&s;afety of England. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th July.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Armada arrives in the Channel.</NOTE> The
Lizard was the fir&s;t land made by the Armada, about &s;un&s;et; and as the
Spaniards took it for the Ram-head near Plymouth, they bore out to &s;ea, with
an intention of returning next day, and attacking the Engli&s;h navy. They were
de&s;cried by Fleming, a Scoti&s;h pyrate, who was roving in the&s;e &s;eas,
and who immediately &s;et &s;ail, to inform the Engli&s;h admiral of their
approach<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">8.</NOTE>: Another fortunate event, which contributed extremely to
the &s;afety of the fleet. Effingham had ju&s;t time to get out of port, when
he &s;aw the Spani&s;h Armada coming full &s;ail towards him, di&s;po&s;ed in
the form of a half-moon, and &s;tretching the di&s;tance of &s;even miles from
the extremity of one divi&s;ion to that of the other.</P>
<P>THE writers of that age rai&s;e their &s;tile by a pompous
de&s;cription of this &s;pec|tacle; the mo&s;t magnificent which had ever
appeared upon the ocean, infu&s;ing equal terror and admiration into the minds
of all beholders. The lofty ma&s;ts, the &s;welling &s;ails, and the towering
prows of the Spani&s;h galleons, &s;eem impo&s;|&s;ible to be ju&s;tly painted,
otherwi&s;e than by a&s;&s;uming the colours of poetry; and an eloquent
hi&s;torian of Italy, in imitation of Camden, has a&s;&s;erted, that the
Armada, tho' the &s;hips bore every &s;ail, yet advanced with a &s;low motion;
as if the ocean groaned with &s;upporting, and the winds were tired with
impelling, &s;o enormous a weight<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">

is, the large&s;t of the Spani&s;h ve&s;|&s;els would &s;carce pa&s;s for third
rates in the pre&s;ent navy of England; yet were they &s;o ill framed, or &s;o
ill governed, that they were quite unwieldy, and could not &s;ail upon a wind,
nor tack on occa&s;ion, nor be managed in &s;tormy weather by the &s;eamen.
Neither the mechanics of &s;hip-building, nor the experience of mariners, had
attained &s;o great perfection as could &s;erve for the &s;ecurity and
go|vernment of &s;uch bulky ve&s;&s;els; and the Engli&s;h, who had already had
expe|rience how un&s;erviceable they commonly were, were not di&s;mayed with
their tremendous appearance.</P>
<P>EFFINGHAM gave orders, not to come to a clo&s;e &s;ight with the
Spaniards, where the &s;ize of the &s;hips, he &s;u&s;pected, and the numbers
of &s;oldiers, would be a di&s;|advantage to the Engli&s;h; but to cannonade
them at a di&s;tance, and to wait the opportunity which winds, currents, or
various chances mu&s;t afford them, of in|tercepting &s;ome &s;cattered
ve&s;&s;els of the enemy. Nor was it long before the event an&s;wered
expectation. A great &s;hip of Bi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, on board of which was a con&s;i|derable <PB N="638" REF="243">
part of the Spani&s;h money, was &s;et on fire by accident; and while all hands
were employed in extingui&s;hing it, &s;he fell behind the re&s;t of the
Armada: The great galleon of Andaluzia was detained by the &s;pringing of her
ma&s;t: And both the&s;e ve&s;&s;els were taken, after &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance,
by Sir Francis Drake. As the Armada advanced up the channel, the Engli&s;h hung
upon their rear, and &s;till infe&s;ted them with &s;kirmi&s;hes. Each trial
abated the confidence of the Spa|niards, and added courage to the Engli&s;h;
and the latter &s;oon found, that even in clo&s;e fight the &s;ize of the
Spani&s;h &s;hips was no advantage to them. Their bulk expo&s;ed them the more
to the bullets of the enemy; while their cannon, placed too high, &s;hot over
the heads of the Engli&s;h. The alarm having now reached the coa&s;t of
England, the nobility and gentry ha&s;tened out with their ve&s;&s;els from
every harbour, and rein&s;orced the admiral. The earls of Oxford,
Northum|berland, and Cumberland, Sir Thomas Cecil, Sir Robert Cecil, Sir Walter
Raleigh, Sir Thomas Vava&s;or, Sir Thomas Gerrard, Sir Charles Blount; with
many others, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by this generous and
di&s;intere&s;ted &s;ervice of their country. The Engli&s;h fleet, after the
conjunction of the&s;e &s;hips, a|mounted to an hundred and forty fail.</P>
<P>THE Armada had now reached Calais, a d ca&s;t anchor before that
place, in expectation, that the duke of Parma, who had got intelligence of
their ap|proach, would put to &s;ea, and join his forces to them. The Engli&s;h
admi|ral practi&s;ed here a very &s;ucce&s;sful &s;tratagem upon the Spaniards.
He took eight of his &s;maller &s;hips, and filling them with all combu&s;tible
materials, &s;ent them, one after another, into the mid&s;t of the enemy. The
Spaniards fancied, that they were fire&s;hips of the &s;ame contrivance with a
famous ve&s;&s;el which had lately done &s;o much execution at Antwerp; and
they immediately cut their cables, and took to &s;light with the greate&s;t
di&s;order and precipitation. The Engli&s;h &s;ell upon them next morning,
while in confu&s;ion; and be&s;ides doing great damage to other &s;hips, they
took or de&s;troyed about twelve of the enemy.</P>
<P>BY this time, it was become apparent, that the intention, for
which the&s;e great preparations were made by the Spaniards, was entirely
&s;ru&s;trated. The ve&s;&s;els, provided by the duke of Parma, were made for
tran&s;port, not for &s;ight|ing; and that general, when urged to leave the
harbour, utterly refu&s;ed to ex|po&s;e his flouri&s;hing army to &s;uch
apparent hazard, as it mu&s;t incur; while the Engli&s;h, not only were able to
keep the &s;ea, but &s;eemed even to triumph over their enemy. The Spani&s;h
admiral found, in many r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ncounters,
that while he lo&s;t &s;o con&s;iderable a part of his own navy, he had
de&s;troyed only one &s;mall ve&s;&s;el of the Engli&s;h; and he fore&s;aw,
that, by continuing &s;o unequal a combat, he mu&s;t draw inevitable
de&s;truction on all the remainder. He prepared therefore to 
<PB N="639" REF="244"> <MILESTONE N="1581" UNIT="year"> return homewards; but
as the winds were contrary in his pa&s;&s;age thro' the chan|nel, he re&s;olved
to &s;ail northwards, and making the tour of the whole i&s;land, reach the
Spani&s;h harbours by the ocean. The Engli&s;h fleet followed him during &s;ome
time; and had not their ammunition fallen &s;hort, by the negligence of the
offices in &s;upplying them, they had obliged the whole Armada to &s;urrender
at di&s;cretion. The duke of Medina had once taken that re&s;olution; but was
di|verted from it by the advice of his confe&s;&s;or. This conclu&s;ion of the
enterprize would have been more glorious to the Engli&s;h; but the event proved
equally fatal to the Spaniards. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeated.</NOTE> A violent tempe&s;t overtook
the Armada after it pa&s;&s;ed the Orkneys: The &s;hips had already lo&s;t
their anchors, and were obliged to keep to &s;ea: The mariners, unaccu&s;tomed
to &s;uch hard&s;hips, and not able to govern &s;uch unwieldy ve&s;&s;els,
yielded to the fury of the &s;torm, and allowed their &s;hips to drive either
on the we&s;tern i&s;les of Scotland, or on the coa&s;t of Ireland, where they
were mi&s;erably &s;hipwrecked. Not a half of the navy returned to Spain; and
the &s;eamen, as well as &s;oldiers, who remained, were &s;o overcome with
hard|&s;hip and fatigue, &s;o di&s;pirited by their di&s;comfiture, that they
filled all Spain with accounts of the valour of the Engli&s;h, and of the
tempe&s;tuous violence of that ocean which &s;urrounds them.</P>
<P>SUCH was the mi&s;erable and di&s;honourable conclu&s;ion of an
enterprize, which had been preparing for three years, which had exhau&s;ted the
revenue and force of Spain, and which had long filled all Europe with anxiety
or expectation. Philip, who was a &s;lave to his pa&s;&s;ions, but had an
entire command over his coun|tenance, no &s;ooner heard of the mortifying
event, which bla&s;ted all his &s;chemes of ambition, than he fell on his
knees, and rendering thanks for that gracious di&s;pen&s;ation of providence,
expre&s;&s;ed his joy that the calamity was not greater. The Spani&s;h
prie&s;ts, who had &s;o ofttn ble&s;t this holy croi&s;ade, and foretold its
intallible &s;ucce&s;s, were &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s to account for the victory
gained over the catholic monarch by excommunicated heretics and an execrable
u&s;urper: But they at la&s;t di&s;covered, that all the calamities of the
Spaniards had proceeded from their allowing the infidel Moors to live among
them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 525. On the fourth of

<P>THE imperious conduct of Elizabeth appeared &s;till more clearly
in another parliamentary tran&s;action. The right of purveyance was an antient
prerogative, by which the officers of the crown could at plea&s;ure take
provi&s;ions for the hou&s;hold from all the neighbouring counties, and the
u&s;e of carts and carriages; and the price of the&s;e &s;ervices was fixed and
&s;tated. The payment of the money was often di&s;tant and uncertain; and the
rates were always much inferior to the market price; &s;o that purveyance,
be&s;ides the &s;lavery of it, was always regarded as a great burthen, and
being arbitrary and ca&s;ual, was liable to great abu&s;es. We may fairly
pre&s;ume, that the hungry courtiers of Elizabeth, &s;upported by her unlimited
power, would be &s;ure to render this prerogative very oppre&s;&s;ive to the
people; and the commons had, la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, found it nece&s;&s;ary to
pa&s;s a bill for regulating the&s;e exactions: But the bill was lo&s;t in the
hou&s;e of peers<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">D'Ewe&punc; p
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE>. The continuance of the
abu&s;es begot a new attempt for redre&s;s; and the &s;ame bill was now
revived, and &s;ent up again to the hou&s;e of peers, together with a bill for
&s;ome new regulations in the court of Exchequer. Soon after, the commons
received a me&s;&s;age from the upper hou&s;e, de&s;iring them to appoint a
committee for a conference. At this conference, the peers informed them, that
the Queen, by a me&s;&s;age, delivered by lord Burleigh, had expre&s;&s;ed her
di&s;plea&s;ure, that the commons &s;hould pre&s;ume to touch on her
prerogative. If there were any abu&s;es, &s;he &s;aid, either in impo&s;ing
purveyance, or in the practice of the court of Ex|chequer, her maje&s;ty was
both able and willing to provide due reformation; but would not permit the
Parliament to intermeddle in the&s;e matters<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>.
The com|mons, alarmed at this intelligence, appointed a new committee to attend
the Queen, and endeavour to &s;atisfy her of their humble and dutiful
intentions&punc; Elizabeth gave a gracious reception to the committee: She
expre&s;&s;ed her great <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;timable loving care</HI> towards her loving &s;ubjects; which,
&s;he &s;aid, was greater than of her own &s;elf, or even than any of them
could have of them&s;elves. She told them, that &s;he had already given orders
for an enquiry into the abu&s;es attending purveyance, but the dangers of the
Spani&s;h inva&s;ion had retarded the progre&s;s of that de&s;ign; that &s;he
had as much &s;kill, will, and power to rule her own hou&s;e|hold 
<PB N="642" REF="247"> as any &s;ubjects what&s;oever to govern theirs, and
needed as little the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her neighbours; that the Exchequer was
her chamber, con&s;equently more near to her than even her hou&s;hold, and
therefore the le&s;s proper for them to intermeddle with; and that &s;he would
of her&s;elf, with the advice of her council and the judges, redre&s;s all
grievances in the&s;e matters, but would not permit them, by laws moved without
her privity, to bereave her of the honour attend|ing the&s;e regulations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 444.</NOTE>. The i&s;&s;ue of this matter was the

particular, than her predece&s;&s;ors; at lea&s;t, her more re|mote ones: For

<P>We may judge of the extent and importance of the&s;e
abu&s;es by a &s;peech of Bacon's again&s;t pur|veyors, delivered in the
fir&s;t Parliament of the &s;ub&s;equent reign. 
<Q REND="inline">"Fir&s;t," &s;ays he, "they take in hand
what they ought not to take; &s;econdly, they take in quantity a far greater
proportion than cometh to your maje&s;ty's u&s;e; thirdly, they take in an
unlawful manner, in a manner, I &s;ay, directly and expre&s;sly prohibited by
&s;everal laws. For the fir&s;t, I am a little to alter their name: For
in&s;tead of takers, they become taxers: In&s;tead of taking provi&s;ions for
your maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, they tax your people <HI>ad redimendam
vexationem;</HI> impo&s;ing upon them and extorting from them divers &s;ums of
mo|ney, &s;ometimes in gro&s;s, &s;ometimes in the nature of &s;tipends
annually paid, <HI>ne noceant,</HI> to be freed and ea&s;ed of their
oppre&s;&s;ion. Again, they take trees, which by law they cannot do; timber
trees, which are the beauty, countenance and &s;helter of men's hou&s;es; that
men have long &s;pared from their own pur&s;e and profit; that men e&s;teem,
for their u&s;e and delight, above ten times the value; that area lo&s;s which
men cannot repair or recover. The&s;e do they take, to the defacing and
&s;poiling of your &s;ubjects man&s;ions and dwellings, except they may be
compounded with to their own appetites. And if a gentleman be too hard for them
while he is at home, they will watch their time when there is but a baili&s;&s;
or a &s;ervant remaining, and put the ax to the root of the tree, ere ever the
ma&s;ter can &s;top it. Again, they u&s;e a &s;trange and mo&s;t unju&s;t
exaction in cau&s;ing the &s;ubjects to pay poundage of their own debts, due
from your maje&s;ty unto them: So as a poor man, when he has had his hay or his
wood, or his poultry (which perchance he was full loath to part with, and had
for the provi&s;ion of his own family and not to put to &s;ale) taken from him,
and that not at a ju&s;t price, but under the value, and cometh to receive his
money, he &s;hall have after the rate of twelve pence in the pound abated for
poundage of his due payment upon &s;o hard conditions. Nay farther they are
grown to that extremity (as is affirmed, tho' it be &s;carce credible, &s;ave
that in &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> all things are
credible) that they will take double poundage, once when the debenture is
made<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> and again the &s;econd time,
when the money is paid. For the &s;econd point, mo&s;t gracious &s;overign,
touching the quantity which they take &s;ar above that which is an&s;wered to
your maje&s;ty's u&s;e; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">
affirmed unto me by divers gentlemen of good report, as a matter which I may
&s;afely avouch unto your maje&s;ty, that there is no pound profit, which
redoundeth unto your maje&s;ty in this cour&s;e but induceth and begetteth
three pound damage upon your &s;ubjects, be&s;ide the di&s;contentment. And to
the end they may make their &s;poil more &s;ecurely, what do they? Whereas
divers &s;tatutes do &s;trictly provide, that what&s;oever they take &s;hall be
regi&s;tered and atte&s;ted, to the end that by mak|ing a collation of that
which is taken from the country and that which is an&s;wered above, their
de|ceits might appear, they, to the end to ob&s;cure their deceits, utterly
omit the ob&s;ervation of this which the law pre&s;cribeth. And therefore to
de&s;cend, if it may plea&s;e your maje&s;ty, to the third &s;ort of abu&s;e,
which is of the unlawful manner of their taking, whereof this que&s;tion is a
branch; it is &s;o manifold, as it rather a&s;keth an enumeration of &s;ome of
the particulars than a pro&s;ecution of all. For their price, by law they ought
to take as they can agree with the &s;ubject; by abu&s;e they take at an
impo&s;ed and enforced price: By law they ought to make but one apprizement by
neigh|bours in the country; by abu&s;e, they make a &s;econd apprizement at the
court gate, and when the &s;ubjects cattle come up many miles lean and out of
plight by rea&s;on of their travel, then they prize them anew at an abated
price: By law, they ought to take between &s;un and &s;un; by abu&s;e, they
take by twilight and in the night-time, a time well cho&s;en for malefactors:
By law, they ought not to take in the high-ways (a place by her maje&s;ty's
high prerogative protected, and by &s;tatute by &s;pecial words excepted) by
abu&s;e, they take in the high-ways: By law, they ought to &s;hew their

<P>Such were the abu&s;es, which Elizabeth would neither permit

<P><PB N="645" REF="250"> THE Engli&s;h landed at Paniche, a
&s;ea-port town, twelve leagues from Li&s;bon; and Norris led the army to that
capital, while Drake undertook to &s;ail up the river, and attack the city with
his united forces. By this time, the court of Spain had got leizure to prepare
again&s;t the inva&s;ion of the Engli&s;h. Forces were thrown into Li&s;bon:
The Portugue&s;e were di&s;armed: All &s;u&s;pected per|&s;ons were taken into

none of them dared to declare in favour of the invaders. The Engli&s;h army,
however, made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the &s;uburbs, which abounded with
riches of all kinds; but as they de&s;ired to conciliate the affections of the
Portugueze, and were more intent on honour than profit, they ob&s;erved a
&s;trict di&s;cipline, and ab&s;tained from all plunder. Meanwhile they found
their ammu|nition and provi&s;ions totally exhau&s;ted; they had not a &s;ingle
cannon to make a breach in the walls; the admiral had not been able to pa&s;s
&s;ome fortre&s;&s;es, which guarded the river; there was no appearance of any
in&s;urrection in their favour; &s;ickne&s;s from fatigue, hunger, and
intemperance in wine and fruits had &s;eized the army: So that it was found
requi&s;ite to make all ha&s;te po&s;&s;ible to reimbark. They were not

laden with naval &s;tores, they &s;eized them as lawful prize; tho' they
belonged to the Han&s;e Towns, a neutral power. They &s;ailed thence to Vigo,
which they took and burned; and having ravaged the country round, they &s;et
&s;ail and arrived &s;afely in England. Above the half of the&s;e gallant

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="year"> AFTER a &s;tate of great anxiety and
many difficulties, Elizabeth had at length reached a &s;ituation, where, tho'
her affairs &s;till required attention, and found employment for her active
temper, &s;he was removed from all danger of any immediate revolution, and
might regard the efforts of her enemies with &s;ome degree of confidence and
&s;ecurity. Her &s;ucce&s;sful and prudent admini&s;tra|tion had gained her,
together with the admiration of foreigners, the affections of her own
&s;ubjects; and after the death of the Queen of Scots, even the catholics,
however di&s;contented, pretended not to di&s;pute her title, or adhere to any
other per&s;on as her rival and competitor. James, curbed by his factious
nobility and eccle&s;ia&s;tics, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at home very little
authority; and was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> to remain
on good terms with Elizabeth and the Engli&s;h nation, in hopes that time,
aided by his patient tranquillity, would &s;ecure him that rich
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to which his birth entitled him. The Hollanders, tho'
overmatched in their conte&s;t with <PB N="648" REF="253">
<MILESTONE N="1590" UNIT="year"> Spain, &s;till made an ob&s;tinate
re&s;i&s;tance; and &s;uch was their unconquerable anti|pathy to their old
ma&s;ters, and &s;uch the prudent conduct of young Maurice, their governor,
that the &s;ubduing that &s;mall territory, if at all po&s;&s;ible, mu&s;t be
the work of years, and the re&s;ult of many and great &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Philip,
who, in his powerful effort again&s;t England, had been tran&s;ported by
re&s;entment and am|bition beyond his u&s;ual cautious maxims, was now
di&s;abled, and &s;till more di&s;|couraged, from adventuring again on &s;uch
hazardous enterprizes. The &s;ituation al&s;o of affairs in France, began
chiefly to employ his attention; but notwith|&s;tanding all his artifice, and
force, and expence, the events in that kingdom proved every day more contrary
to his preten&s;ions, and more favourable to the friends and confederates of
England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">French affairs.</NOTE> THE violence of the
League having con&s;trained Henry to declare war again&s;t the Hugonots,
the&s;e religioni&s;t, &s;eemed expo&s;ed to the utmo&s;t danger; and
Eli|zabeth, &s;en&s;ible of the intimate connection between her own intere&s;ts
and tho&s;e of that party, had &s;upported the King of Navarre by her
negociations in Ger|many, and &s;till more by large &s;ums of money, which
&s;he remitted for levying forces in that country. That heroic prince, not
di&s;couraged by the great &s;upe|riority of his enemies, took the field; and
in the year 1587 gained, at Coutras, a compleat victory over the army of the
French King; but as his allies, the Ger|mans, were at the &s;ame time
di&s;comfited by the army of the League, under the duke of Gui&s;e, his
&s;ituation, notwith&s;tanding his victory, &s;eemed &s;till as de&s;pe|rate as
ever. The chief advantage which he reaped from this diver&s;ity of &s;ucce&s;s,
was the divi&s;ions which, by that means, took place among his enemies. The
inhabitants of Paris, intoxicated with admiration of Gui&s;e, and &s;trongly
preju|diced again&s;t their King, who&s;e intentions had become &s;u&s;picious
to them, took to arms, and obliged Henry to fly for his &s;afety. That prince,
di&s;&s;embling his re&s;entment, entered into negociation with the League; and
having conferred many high offices on Gui&s;e and his partizans, &s;ummoned an
a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates at Blois, under preten e of finding means and
expedients to &s;upport the intended war again&s;t the Hugonots. The various
&s;cenes of per&s;idy and cruelty which had been exhibited in France, had
ju&s;tly begot a mutual di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">idence
among all parties; yet Gui&s;e, tru&s;ting more to the timidity than honour of
the King, ra&s;hly put him&s;elf into the hands of that monarch, and expected,
by the a&s;cendant of his own ge|nius, to make him &s;ubmit to all his
exorbitant preten&s;ions. Henry, tho' of an ea&s;y di&s;po&s;ition, not
&s;teddy to his re&s;olutions, nor even to his promi&s;es, wanted neither
courage nor capacity; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of the duke of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> and finding all his
&s;ubtilties eluded by the vigour of Gui&s;e, and even his throne expo&s;ed to
the mo&s;t imminent danger, he embraced <PB N="649" REF="254"> more violent
coun&s;els than were natural to him, and ordered that duke and his brother, the
cardinal of Gui&s;e, to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in his palace.</P>
<P>THIS cruel execution, which the nece&s;&s;ity of it could alone
excu&s;e, had nearly proved fatal to the author, and &s;eemed at fir&s;t to
plunge him into greater dangers than tho&s;e which he &s;ought to avoid, by
taking vengeance on his enemy. The partizans of the league were enflamed with
the utmo&s;t rage again&s;t him: The populace every where, particularly at
Paris, renounced all allegiance to him: The eccle&s;ia&s;tics and the preachers
filled all places with execrations again&s;t his name: And the mo&s;t powerful
cities, and the mo&s;t opulent provinces, appeared to combine in a re&s;olution
of renouncing monarchy, or of changing their mo|narch. Henry, finding &s;lender
re&s;ources among his catholic &s;ubjects, was con|&s;trained to enter into a
confederacy with the Hugonots and the King of Navarre: He enli&s;ted large
bodies of Swi&s;s infantry and German cavalry: And being &s;till &s;upported by
his chief nobility, he a&s;&s;embled, by all the&s;e means, an army of near
forty thou&s;and men, and advanced to the gates of Paris, ready to cru&s;h the
League, and &s;ubdue all his enemies. The de&s;perate re&s;olution of one man
di|verted the cour&s;e of the&s;e great events. Jaques Clement, a Dominican
monk, inflamed by that bloody &s;pirit of bigotry which di&s;tingui&s;hes this
century, and a great part of the following one, beyond all other ages of the
world, embraced the re&s;olution of &s;acrificing his own life, in order to
&s;ave the church from the per|&s;ecutions of an heretical tyrant; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Henry the third.</NOTE> and being
admitted, under &s;ome pretext, to the King's pre&s;ence, he gave that prince a
mortal wound with a knife, and was im|mediately put to death, by the courtiers,
who ha&s;tily revenged the murder of their &s;overeign. This remarkable
incident happened on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1589.</P>
<P>THE King of Navarre, next heir to the crown, a&s;&s;umed the
government, un|der the title of Henry the fourth; but &s;ucceeded to much
greater difficulties than tho&s;e which &s;urrounded his predece&s;&s;or. The
prejudices entertained again&s;t his re|ligion, made a great part of the
nobility de&s;ert him; and it was only by his pro|mi&s;e of hearkening to
conferences and in&s;truction, that he could engage any of the catholics to
adhere to his undoubted title. The League, governed by the duke of Mayenne,
brother to Gui&s;e, gathered new force; and the King of Spain entertained
views, either of di&s;membering the monarchy, or of annexing the whole to his
own dominions. In the&s;e di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances, Henry addre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to Elizabeth, and found her well di&s;po&s;ed to contribute to his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of the catholic League, and of
the King of Spain, her inveterate and dangerous enemies. To prevent the
de&s;ertion of his Swi&s;s and German troops, &s;he made him a pre&s;ent of
twenty-two thou&s;and pounds; a larger <PB N="650" REF="255" MS="y"> &s;um
than, as he declared, he had ever &s;een before: And &s;he &s;ent him a
reinforce|ment of four thou&s;and men, under lord Willoughby, an officer of
reputation, who joined the French at Dieppe. Strengthened by the&s;e
&s;upplies, Henry march|ed directly to Paris; and having taken the &s;uburbs,
&s;word in hand, he abandon|ed them to be pillaged by his &s;oldiers. He
employed this body of Engli&s;h troops in many other enterprizes; and found
&s;till great cau&s;e to prai&s;e their courage and fidelity. The time of their
&s;ervice being elap&s;ed, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with many high
commendations. Sir William Drury, Sir Thomas Ba&s;kerville, and Sir John
Boroughs, acquired reputation this campaign, and revived in France the ancient
fame of Engli&s;h valour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progre&s;s of Henry the fourth.</NOTE> THE
army which Henry next campaign led into the field, was much inferior to that of
the League; but as it was compo&s;ed of the chief nobility of France, he feared
not to encounter his enemies in a pitched battle at Yvr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">, and he gained a compleat victory over them. This
&s;ucce&s;s enabled him to blockade Paris, and he reduced that capital to the
la&s;t extremity of famine: When the duke of Parma, in con&s;equence of orders
from Philip, marched to the relief of the League, and obliged Henry to rai&s;e
the blockade. Having performed this important &s;ervice, he retired back to the
Low Countries; and by his con|&s;ummate &s;kill in the art of war, performed
the&s;e long marches in the face of the enemy, without affording the French
monarch that opportunity which he &s;ought, of giving him battle, or &s;o much
as putting his army once in di&s;order. The only lo&s;s which he &s;u&s;tained,
was in the Low Countries; where prince Maurice took advantage of his ab&s;ence,
and recovered &s;ome towns which Parma had for|merly conquered from the
States<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This year the nation &s;uffered a great lo&s;s,

<P><MILESTONE N="1591" UNIT="year"> THE &s;ituation of Henry's
affairs, tho' promi&s;ing, was not &s;o well advanced or e&s;tabli&s;hed as to
make the Queen di&s;continue her &s;uccours; and &s;he was &s;till more
confirmed in the re&s;olution of &s;upporting him, by &s;ome advantages gained
by the King of Spain. The duke of Mercoeur, governor of Britanny, a prince of
the hou&s;e of Lorraine, had declared for the League; and finding him&s;elf
hard pre&s;|&s;ed by Henry's forces, he had been obliged, in order to his
&s;ecurity, to introduce &s;ome Spani&s;h troops into the &s;ea-port towns of
that province. Elizabeth was <PB N="651" REF="256"> alarmed with the danger;
and fore&s;aw, that the Spaniards, be&s;ides infe&s;ting the Engli&s;h commerce
by privateers, might employ the&s;e harbours as the &s;eat of their naval
preparations, and might more ea&s;ily, from that near neighbourhood, than from
Spain or Portugal, project an inva&s;ion of England. She concluded, there|fore,
a new treaty with Henry, in which &s;he engaged to &s;end over three thou&s;and
men, to be employed in the reduction of Britanny, and &s;tipulated, that her
charges &s;hould, in a twelve month, or &s;o &s;oon as the enemy was expelled,
be refunded her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 561.</NOTE>. The&s;e forces
were commanded by Sir John Norris; and under him by his brother Henry, and by
Anthony Shirley. Sir Roger Williams was at the head of a &s;mall body which
garri&s;oned Dieppe: And a &s;quadron of &s;hips, under the command of Sir
Henry Palmer, lay upon the coa&s;t of France, and intercept|ed all the
ve&s;&s;els belonging to the Spaniards or the Leaguers.</P>
<P>THE events of war can very little be regulated before hand by
any treaty or agreement; and Henry, who found it requi&s;ite to lay a&s;ide the
projected enter|prize again&s;t Britanny, per&s;uaded the Engli&s;h commanders
to join his army, and to take a &s;hare in the war which he carried on in
Picardy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XIV. p. 116.</NOTE>.
Notwith&s;tand|ing the di&s;gu&s;t which Elizabeth received from this
di&s;appointment, he laid before her a plan for expelling the Leaguers from
Normandy, and per&s;uaded her to &s;end over a new body of four thou&s;and men,
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in that enterprize. The earl of E&s;&s;ex was appointed
general of the&s;e forces; a young nobleman, who, by many exterior
accompli&s;hments, and &s;till more real merit, was daily advanc|ing in favour
with Elizabeth, and &s;eemed to occupy that place in her affections which
Leice&s;ter, who was now decea&s;ed, had &s;o long enjoyed. E&s;&s;ex,
impatient for military fame, was extremely unea&s;y to lie &s;ome time at
Dieppe unemployed; and had not the orders which he received from his
mi&s;tre&s;s been &s;o po&s;itive, he would gladly have accepted of Henry's
invitation, and have marched to join the French army now in Champagne. This
plan of operations was al&s;o propo&s;ed to Elizabeth, by the French
amba&s;&s;ador; but &s;he rejected it with great di&s;plea&s;ure; and &s;he
threatned immediately to recall her troops, if Henry &s;hould per&s;evere any
longer in his pre&s;ent practice, of breaking all concert with her, and
attending to nothing but his own intere&s;ts<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Birch's Negociations.

into Normandy, and laid &s;iege to Ro&uuml;en, which he reduced to great
difficulties. But the League, who were unable of them&s;elves to take the field
again&s;t him, had again recour&s;e to the duke of Parma, who received orders
to march to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He executed this enterprize with his
u&s;ual ability <PB N="652" REF="257"> <MILESTONE N="1592" UNIT="year"> and
&s;ucce&s;s; and, for the pre&s;ent, fru&s;trated all the projects of Henry and

own kingdoms in all her foreign tran&s;actions, was impatient under the&s;e
di&s;appointments, blam|ed Henry for his negligence in the execution of
treaties, and complained, that the Engli&s;h forces were thru&s;t forward in
every hazardous enterprize<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.

DURING the&s;e military operations in France, Elizabeth employed her naval
power again&s;t Spain, and endeavoured to intercept the We&s;t-Indian
trea&s;ures, the &s;ource of that greatne&s;s which rendered Philip &s;o
formidable to all his neighbours. She &s;ent a &s;quadron of &s;even &s;hips,
under the command of lord Thomas How|ard, for this &s;ervice; but the King of
Spain, informed of her purpo&s;e, fitted out a navy of fifty-five &s;ail, and
di&s;patched them to e&s;cort the Indian fleet. They fell in with the Engli&s;h
&s;quadron; and by the courageous ob&s;tinacy of Sir Richard Greenville, the
vice-admiral, who refu&s;ed to make &s;ail with the re&s;t of the &s;qua|dron,
they took one &s;hip, the fir&s;t Engli&s;h man of war which had yet fallen
into the hands of the Spaniards<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This action of
Sir Richard Greenville is &s;o &s;ingular, as to merit a more particular
relation. He was engaged alone with the whole Spani&s;h fleet of fifty-three
&s;ail, which had ten thou&s;and men on board; and from th time the fight
begun, which was about three in the afternoon, to the break of day next
morning, he repul&s;ed the enemy fifteen times, tho' they continually &s;hifted
their ve&s;&s;els, and boarded with fre&s;h men. In the beginning of the action
he him&s;elf received a wound; but he con|tinued doing his duty above deck till
eleven at night, when receiving a fre&s;h wound, he was carried down to be
dre&s;&s;ed. During this operation he received a &s;hot in the head, and the
&s;urgeon was killed by his &s;ide. The Engli&s;h began now to want powder; all
their &s;mall arms were broke or become u&s;e|le&s;s; of their number, which
were but a hundred and three at fir&s;t, forty were killed, and almo&s;t all
the re&s;t wounded; their ma&s;ts were beat overboard, their tackle cut in
pieces, and nothing but a hulk left, unable to move one way or other. In this
&s;ituation Sir Richard propo&s;ed to the &s;hip's company, to tru&s;t to the
mercy of God, not to that of the Spaniards, and to de&s;troy the &s;hip with
them&s;elves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ather than yield to

de&s;pe|rate re&s;olution; but others oppo&s;ed it, and obliged Greenville to
&s;urrender him&s;elf pri&s;oner. He died a few days after; and his la&s;t

one to &s;peak what he li&s;teth, or what cometh in his brain to utter; their
privilege extended no farther than a liberty of Aye or No: That &s;he enjoined
the &s;peaker, if he perceived any idle heads &s;o negligent of their own

might well repre&s;s all farther attempts for freedom: But the religious zeal
of the puritans was not &s;o ea&s;ily re&s;trained; and it in&s;pired a courage
which no human motive was able to &s;urmount. Morrice, attorney of the court of

This motion was &s;econded by &s;ome mem|bers; but the mini&s;ters and privy

The Queen &s;ent for the &s;peaker; and after requiring him to deliver
Morrice's bill to her, &s;he told him, that it was in her power to call
Parliaments, in her power to di&s;&s;olve them, in her power to give a&s;&s;ent
or di&s;&s;ent to any determination which they &s;hould form: That her
purpo&s;e in &s;ummoning thi&punc; Parliament was twofold, to have laws enacted
for the farther enforcement of uniformity in religion, and to provide for the
defence of the nation, again&s;t the exorbitant power of Spain: That the&s;e
two points ought, therefore, to be the object of their deliberation: She had
enjoin d them already, by the mouth of the lord keeper, to meddle neither with
matters of &s;tate nor of religion; and &s;he wondered how any one could be

<P>THE Queen having thus expre&s;sly pointed out, both what the

maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in their due obedience; and was meant, as the preamble
declares, to obviate &s;uch inconveniencies and perils as might grow from the
wicked practices of &s;editious &s;ectaries and di&s;loyal per&s;ons: For
the&s;e two &s;pecies of criminals were always, at that time, confounded
together, as equally dangerous to the peace of &s;ociety. It was enacted, that
any per&s;on, above &s;ix|teen years of age, who ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed,
during the &s;pace of a month, to at|tend the public wor&s;hip, &s;hould be
committed to pri&s;on; that, if after being condemned for this offence, he
per&s;i&s;t three months in his refu&s;al, he mu&s;t abjure the realm; and that
if he either refu&s;e this condition, or return after bani&s;hment, he is to
&s;uffer capitally as a felon, without benefit of clergy<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">35 Eliz. c. 1.</NOTE>. This law bore equally hard upon the
puritans as upon the catholics; and had it not been im|po&s;ed by the Queen's
authority, was probably, in that re&s;pect, very much con|trary to the private
&s;entiments and inclinations of the majority in the hou&s;e of commons. Very

mo&s;t haughty treatment of them, and covered her weakne&s;s under &s;uch a
lofty appearance of &s;uperiority. The commons readily voted two &s;ub&s;idies

in a conference, that they could not give their a&s;&s;ent to the &s;upply
voted, thinking it too &s;mall for the Queen's occa&s;ions: They therefore
propo&s;ed a grant of three &s;ub&s;idies and &s;ix fifteenths, and de&s;ired a
conference, in order to per&s;uade the commons to agree to this mea&s;ure. The
commons, who had acquired the privilege of beginning all bills of &s;ub&s;idy,
took offence at this procedure of the lords, and at fir&s;t ab&s;o|lutely
rejected the conference: But being afraid, on reflection, that they had, by

carried ho&s;tilities into the heart of Britanny; was become &s;en&s;ible, that
he never could, by force of arms alone, render him&s;elf ma&s;ter of his

full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne, the more di&s;content and jealou&s;y
aro&s;e among tho&s;e Ro|mani&s;ts who adhered to him; and a party was formed
in his own court to elect &s;ome catholic monarch of the royal blood, if he
refu&s;ed any longer to &s;atisfy them by declaring his conver&s;ion. This
excellent prince was far from being a bigot to his &s;ect; and as he e&s;teemed
the&s;e theological di&s;putes to be entirely &s;ub|ordinate to the public
good, he had tacitly determined, from the beginning, to come, &s;ome time or
other, to the re&s;olution required of him. He had found, on the death of his
predece&s;&s;or, that the hugonots, who formed the brave&s;t and mo&s;t
faithful part of his army, were &s;uch determined zealots, that, if he had, at
that time, abjured their faith, they would in&s;tantly have abandoned him to
the pre|ten&s;ions and u&s;urpations of the catholics. The more bigoted
catholics, he knew, particularly tho&s;e of the League, had entertained &s;uch
an un&s;urmountable preju|dice again&s;t his per&s;on, and diffidence of his
&s;incerity, that even his conver&s;ion would not reconcile them to his title;
and he mu&s;t either expect to be entirely excluded the throne, or to be
admitted to it on &s;uch terms as would leave him little more than the mere
&s;hadow of royalty. In this delicate &s;ituation he had re|&s;olved to
temporize; to retain the hugonots by continuing the profe&s;&s;ion of their
religion; to gain the moderate catholics by giving them hopes of his
conver&s;ion; to attach both to his per&s;on by conduct and &s;ucce&s;s; and he
hoped, either that the animo&s;ity of war again&s;t the League would make them
drop gradually the que&s;tion of religion, or that he might, in time, after
&s;ome victories over his enemies and &s;ome conferences with divines, make
finally, with more decency and dignity, that abjuration, which mu&s;t have

not found &s;o pliable or incon&s;tant; and Henry was at la&s;t convinced, that

convinced of the weakne&s;s of their cau&s;e, and might more cordially and
&s;incerely, at lea&s;t more decently, embrace the religion, which it was &s;o

&s;hould appear in|credible and &s;upernatural in theologians, it will, at

the catholic &s;uper&s;tition, at lea&s;t, to the antient ceremonies, yet
pretended to be extremely di&s;plea&s;ed with this abjuration of Henry, and
&s;he wrote him a very angry letter, reproaching him with this intere&s;ted

Spain were &s;till their common enemies, &s;he hearkened to his apologies;
continued her &s;uccours both of men and money; and formed a new league, in

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch affairs.</NOTE> THE intrigues of Spain
were not limited to France and England: The never failing pretence of religion,

had been taken, while he was making his pa&s;&s;age &s;ecretly into Spain; and
&s;ome papers were found about him, by which a dangerous con|&s;piracy of

confederacy with the Spani&s;h monarch; and had &s;tipulated to rai&s;e all
their forces, to join with thirty thou&s;and Spani&s;h troops, which Philip
engaged to &s;end into Scotland; and after re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the catholic

&s;tates, annulled this agreement as im|po&s;ed by violence; again expelled
Bothwel the country; and obliged him to take &s;helter in England. Elizabeth,
pretending ignorance of the place of his retreat, never executed the treaties,
by which &s;he was obliged to deliver up all rebels and fugitives to the King
of Scotland. During the&s;e di&s;orders, encrea&s;ed by the refractory

victory over the earl of Argyle, who acted by the King's commi&s;&s;ion, found
them&s;elves hard pre&s;&s;ed by James him&s;elf, and agreed, on certain terms,
to leave the kingdom. Bothwel, being detected in a confederacy with them,
forfeited the favour of Elizabeth, and was obliged to take &s;helter, fir&s;t

King, who had long carried on ho&s;tilities with Philip, was at la&s;t

declare war again&s;t that monarch. Elizabeth, being threatened with a new
inva&s;ion in England, and with an in&s;urrection in Ireland, recalled mo&s;t

be&s;ides alledging the conditions of the former treaty, by which they were not

poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, the great &s;uperiority of the Spaniards, and the
difficulty of &s;upporting the war; much more, of &s;aving money to di&s;charge
their incumbrances. After much negotiation, a new treaty was at la&s;t formed;
by which the &s;tates were bound to free the Queen immediately from the charge
of the Engli&s;h auxiliaries, computed at forty thou&s;and pounds a year, to
pay her annu|ally twenty thou&s;and pounds for &s;ome years, to a&s;&s;i&s;t
her with a certain number of &s;hips, and to conclude no peace nor treaty

pounds for four years; but on this condi|tion, that the payment &s;hould be in

<P><MILESTONE N="1596" UNIT="year"> THE Queen &s;till retained in

people, and favour with her&s;elf, the Queen, who was commonly re&s;erved in

him a refu&s;al. Sir Thomas Ba&s;kerville was &s;ent over to France at the head
of twenty thou&s;and Engli&s;h, with which Elizabeth, by a new treaty,
concluded with Henry, bound her&s;elf to &s;upply that prince. Some

and the Low Countries, the mo&s;t &s;evere blows, which &s;he gave the
Spani&s;h greatne&s;s, were owing to tho&s;e naval enterprizes, which either
&s;he or her &s;ubjects &s;carce ever intermitted during one &s;ea&s;on. In
1594, Richard Haw|kins, &s;on to Sir John, the famous navigator, procured the
Queen's commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ailed with three &s;hips to the South Sea by the
&s;traits of Magellan: But his voyage proved unfortunate, and he him&s;elf was
taken pri&s;oner on the coa&s;t of Chili. James Lanca&s;ter was fitted out the
&s;ame year with three &s;hips and a pin|nace by the merchants of London; and
was more fortunate in his adventures. He took thirty-nine &s;hips of the enemy;
and not contented with this &s;ucce&s;s, he made an attempt on Fernambouc in
Brazil, where, he knew, great trea&s;ures were at that time lodged. As he
approached the land, he &s;aw it lined with great numbers of the enemy; but
no-wi&s;e daunted with this appearance, he placed the &s;toute&s;t of his men
in boats, and ordered them to row with &s;uch violence again&s;t the &s;hore as
to &s;plit them in pieces. By this bold action, he both deprived his men of all
hopes of returning but by victory, and terrified the enemy, who fled after a
&s;hort re&s;i&s;tance. He returned home &s;afely with the trea&s;ure, which he
had &s;o bravely acquired. In 1595, Sir Walter Raleigh, who had anew for|feited
the Queen's friend&s;hip by an intrigue with one of the maids of honour, and
who had been confined in pri&s;on for this mi&s;demeanor, no &s;ooner recovered
his liberty than he was pu&s;hed by his active and enterprizing genius to
attempt &s;ome great action. The &s;ucce&s;s of the fir&s;t Spani&s;h
adventurers again&s;t Mexico and Peru had begot an extreme avidity in Europe;
and a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion univer|&s;ally took place, that in the inland parts
of South America, called Guiana, a country as yet undi&s;covered, there were
mines and trea&s;ures and riches far beyond any thing which Cortes or Pizarro
had yet met with. Raleigh, who&s;e turn of mind was &s;omewhat romantic and
extravagant, undertook at his own charge the di&s;covery of this wonderful
country. Having taken the &s;mall tower of St. Jo&s;eph in the i&s;le of
Trinidado, where he found no riches, he left his &s;hip, and &s;ailed up the
river Oroonoko in pinnaces, but without meeting with any thing to an&s;wer his
expectations. On his return, he publi&s;hed an account of this country, full of
the greate&s;t and mo&s;t palpable lies, that were ever attempted to be

&s;ame year, Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins undertook a more important
expedition again&s;t the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements in America; and they car|ried
with them &s;ix &s;hips of the Queen's and twenty more, which they had either
fitted out at their own charges, or which were furni&s;hed them by private
adven|turers. Sir Thomas Ba&s;kerville was appointed commander of the land
forces, which they carried on board with them. Their fir&s;t de&s;ign was to
attempt Porto Rico, where, they knew, a rich carrack was at that time
&s;tationed; but as they had not pre&s;erved the requi&s;ite &s;ecrecy, a
pinnace, having &s;trayed from the fleet, was taken by the Spaniards, and
betrayed the intentions of the Engli&s;h. Preparations were made in that
i&s;land to receive them; and the Engli&s;h fleet, notwith&s;tanding the brave
a&s;&s;ault, which they made on the enemy, was repul&s;ed with lo&s;s. Hawkins
&s;oon after died; and Drake pur&s;ued his cour&s;e to Nombre di Dios, on the
i&s;thmus of Darien; where, having landed his men, he attempted to pa&s;s
forward to Panama, with a view of plundering that place, or, if he found &s;uch
a &s;cheme practicable, of keeping and fortifying it. But he met not with the
&s;ame facility, which had attended his fir&s;t enterprizes on the&s;e parts.
The Spaniards, taught by experience, had every where fortified the pa&s;&s;es,
and had &s;tationed troops in the woods; which &s;o infe&s;ted the Engli&s;h by
continual alarms and &s;kirmi&s;hes, that they were obliged to return, without
being able to effectuate any thing. Drake him&s;elf, from the intemperance of
the climates, from the fatigues of his journey, and from the vexation of his
di&s;appointment, was &s;eized with a di&s;temper, of which he &s;oon after
died. Sir Thomas Ba&s;kerville took the command of the fleet, which was in a
very weak condition; and after having &s;ought a battle near Cuba with a
Spani&s;h fleet, of which the event was not deci&s;ive, he returned to England.
The Spaniards &s;uffered &s;ome lo&s;s from this enterprize; but the Engli&s;h
reaped no profit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE bad &s;ucce&s;s of this enterprize in the Indies made the
Engli&s;h rather at|tempt the Spani&s;h dominions in Europe, where, they heard,
Philip was making great preparations for a new inva&s;ion of England. A
powerful fleet was equipped at Plymouth con&s;i&s;ting of an hundred and
&s;eventy ve&s;&s;els, &s;eventeen of which were capital &s;hips of war; the
re&s;t tenders and &s;mall ve&s;&s;els: Twenty &s;hips were added by the
Hollanders. In this fleet there were computed to be &s;ix thou&s;and three
hundred and &s;ixty &s;oldiers, a thou&s;and volunteers, and &s;ix thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and &s;eventy-two &s;eamen, be&s;ide the Dutch. The land forces
were com|manded by the earl of E&s;&s;ex. The navy by lord Effingham, high
admiral. Both the&s;e commanders had expended great &s;ums of their own in this
armament: For &s;uch was the &s;pirit of Elizabeth's reign. The lord Thomas
Howard, Sir <PB N="665" REF="270"> <MILESTONE N="1597" UNIT="year"> Walter
Raleigh, Sir Francis Vere, Sir George Carew, and Sir Coniers Clifford had
commands in this expedition, and were named as a council to the general and
admiral<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 591.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fleet &s;et &s;ail on the fir&s;t of June 1596; and meeting
with a fair wind, bent their cour&s;e to Cadiz, at which place, by &s;ealed
orders delivered to all the captains, the general rende&s;vous was appointed.
They &s;ent before them &s;ome armed tenders, which intercepted every &s;hip,
that could carry intelligence to the enemy; and they them&s;elves were &s;o
fortunate when they came near Cadiz, as to take an Iri&s;h ve&s;&s;el, by which
they learned, that that port was full of merchant &s;hips of great value, and
that the Spaniards lived in perfect &s;ecurity, without any ap|prehen&s;ions of
an enemy. This intelligence much encouraged the Engli&s;h fleet, and gave them
the pro&s;pect of a fortunate i&s;&s;ue to the enterprize.</P>
<P>AFTER a fruitle&s;s attempt to land at St. Seba&s;tians on the
we&s;tern &s;ide of the i&s;land of Cadiz; it was, upon deliberation,
re&s;olved by the council of war to attack the &s;hips and gallies in the bay.
This attempt was e&s;teemed very ra&s;h; and the lord admiral him&s;elf, who
was cautious in his temper, had entertained great &s;cruples with regard to it:
But E&s;&s;ex &s;trenuou&s;ly urged the enterprize; and when he found the
re&s;olution at la&s;t taken, he threw his hat into the &s;ea, and gave
&s;ymp'oms of the mo&s;t extravagant joy. He felt, however, a great
morti|fication, when Effingham informed him, that the Queen, who was anxious
for his &s;afety, and who dreaded the effects of his youthful ardour, had
&s;ecretly given orders, that he &s;hould not be permitted to command the van
in the attack<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 196.</NOTE>. That
duty was performed by Sir Walter Raleigh and the lord Thomas Howard; but
E&s;&s;ex no &s;ooner came within reach of the enemy, than he forgot the
pro|mi&s;e which the admiral had exacted of him to keep in the mid&s;t of the
fleet: He broke thro' and pre&s;&s;ed forward into the thicke&s;t of the fire.
Emulation for glory, avidity of plunder, animo&s;ity again&s;t the Spaniards,
proved incentives to every one; and the enemy were &s;oon obliged to loo&s;e
anchor, and retreat farther into the bay, where they ran many of their &s;hips
aground. E&s;&s;ex then landed his men at the fort of Puntal; and immediately
marched to the attack of Cadiz, which the impetuous valour of the Engli&s;h
&s;oon carried &s;word in hand. The genero&s;ity of E&s;&s;ex, which was not
inferior to his valour, made him &s;oon &s;top the &s;laughter, and treat his
pri&s;oners with the greate&s;t humani y, and even a&s;&s;ability and
kindne&s;s. The Engli&s;h made a rich plunder in the

lo&s;s, which the Spaniards &s;uffered in this enterprize, amounted to twenty
millions of ducats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol II p.

received, from the taking one of their chief cities, and de&s;troying in their
harbour a fleet of &s;uch force and value.</P>
<P>ESSEX, all on fire for glory, regarded this great &s;ucce&s;s
only as a &s;tep to fu|ture atchievements: He in&s;i&s;ted on the keeping
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cadiz, and he under|took with four hundred men and three
months provi&s;ions, to defend the place till &s;uccours &s;hould arrive from
England. But all the other &s;eamen and &s;oldiers were &s;atisfied with the
glory which they had acquired; and were impatient to return home, in order to
&s;ecure their plunder. Every other propo&s;al of E&s;&s;ex to annoy the enemy,
met with a like reception; his &s;cheme for intercepting the carracks at the
Azores, for a&s;&s;aulting the Groyne, for taking St. Andero, and St.
Seba&s;tian: And the Engli&s;h, finding &s;o great difficulty to drag this
impatient warrior from the enemy, at la&s;t left him on the Spani&s;h coa&s;t,
attended with very few &s;hips. He complained much to the Queen, of their want
of &s;pirit in this en|terprize; nor was &s;he &s;atisfied, that they had
returned without attempting to in|tercept the Indian fleet<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 121.</NOTE>; but the great &s;ucce&s;s in the enterprize
on Cadiz, had covered all their mi&s;carriages: And that prince&s;s, tho' &s;he
admired the lofty ge|nius of E&s;&s;ex, could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing an
e&s;teem for the other officers<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.

gave great di&s;gu&s;t to E&s;&s;ex<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Sydney

that the new dig|nity was conferred on him, on account of his good &s;ervices
in taking Cadiz, and de&s;troying the Spani&s;h &s;hips; a merit which
E&s;&s;ex pretended to belong &s;olely to him&s;elf: And he offered to maintain
this plea by &s;ingle combat again&s;t the earl of Nottingham, or his &s;ons,
or any of his kindred.</P>
<P>THE atchievements in the &s;ub&s;equent year proved not &s;o
fortunate; but, as the Indian fleet very narrowly e&s;caped the Engli&s;h,

that war in which he was engaged, and the &s;u|periority which the Engli&s;h,

having received intelligence, that the Spaniards, tho' their fleets were &s;o

&s;eventeen were her own &s;hips, forty-three were &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, and
the re&s;t tenders and victuallers: She em|barked on board this fleet five
thou&s;and new-levied &s;oldiers, and added a thou&s;and veteran troops, whom
Sir Francis Vere brought from the Netherlands. The earl of E&s;&s;ex, commander
in chief, both of the land and &s;ea forces, was at the head of one &s;quadron:
Lord Thomas Howard was appointed vice-admiral of another; Sir Walter Raleigh of
the third: Lord Mountjoy commanded the land forces under E&s;&s;ex: Vere was
appointed mar&s;hal: Sir George Carew lieutenant of the ordnance, and Sir
Chri&s;topher Blount fir&s;t colonel. The earls of Rut|land and Southampton,
the lords Grey, Cromwel, and Rich, with &s;everal other per&s;ons of
di&s;tinction, attended as volunteers. E&s;&s;ex declared his re&s;olution,
ei|ther to de&s;troy this new Armada, which threatned England, or to peri&s;h
in the attempt.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">9th July.</NOTE> THIS powerful fleet &s;et
&s;ail from Plymouth; but were no &s;ooner out of the har|bour than they met
with a furious &s;torm, which &s;hattered and di&s;per&s;ed them; and before
they could be refitted, E&s;&s;ex found, that their provi&s;ions were &s;o far
&s;pent, that it would not be &s;afe to carry &s;o numerous an army along with
him. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, therefore, all the &s;oldiers, except the thou&s;and
veterans under Vere; and laying a&s;ide all thoughts of attacking Ferrol or the
Groyne, he confined the object of his expedition to the intercepting the Indian
fleet; which had at fir&s;t been con&s;idered only as the &s;econd enterprize
which he was to attempt.</P>
<P>THE Indian fleet, at that time, by rea&s;on of the imperfection
of navigation, had a &s;tated cour&s;e, as well as &s;ea&s;on, both in their
going out and in their return; and there were certain i&s;lands, at which, as
at fixed &s;tages, they always touched, and where they took in water and
provi&s;ions. The Azores, being one of the&s;e places where, about this time,
the fleet was expected, E&s;&s;ex bent his cour&s;e thi|ther; and he informed
Raleigh, that he, on his arrival, intended to attack Fayal, one of the&s;e
i&s;lands. By &s;ome accident the &s;quadrons were &s;eparated; and Ra|leigh
arriving fir&s;t before Fayal, thought it more prudent, after waiting &s;ome
time for the general, to begin the attack alone, le&s;t the inhabitants
&s;hould, by farther delay, have leizure to make greater preparations for their
de&s;ence. He &s;ucceeded in the enterprize; but E&s;&s;ex, jealous of Raleigh,
expre&s;&s;ed great di&s;plea&s;ure at this conduct, and con&s;trued it as an
intention of robbing the general of the glory which attended that action: He
ca&s;hiered, therefore, Sydney, Bret, Berry, and others, who had concuried in
the attempt; and would have proceeded to the &s;ame extremity again&s;t Raleigh
him&s;elf, had not lord Thomas Howard interpo&s;ed with his good offices, and
per&s;uaded Raleigh, tho' very high-&s;pirited, to make <PB N="668" REF="273">
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the general. E&s;&s;ex, who was placable, as well as
ha&s;ty and pa&s;&s;i|onate, was &s;oon appea&s;ed, and both received Raleigh
into favour, and re&s;tored the other officers to their command<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 173.</NOTE>. This incident, however, tho' the quarrel
was &s;eemingly accommodated, laid the fir&s;t foundation of that violent
animo&s;ity which afterwards took place between the&s;e two gallant
commanders.</P>
<P>ESSEX made next a di&s;po&s;ition proper for intercepting the
Indian galleons; and Sir William Mon&s;on, who&s;e &s;tation was the mo&s;t
remote of the fleet, having fallen in with them, made the &s;ignals which had
been agreed on. That able offi|cer here a&s;cribes E&s;&s;ex's failure of
&s;ucce&s;s, when he was &s;o near attaining &s;o migh|ty an advantage, to his
want of experience in &s;eaman&s;hip; and the account which he gives of the
errors committed by that nobleman, appears very rea&s;onable as well as
candid<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 174.</NOTE>. The Spani&s;h
fleet, finding that their enemy was upon them, made all the &s;ail po&s;&s;ible
to the Terceras, and got into the &s;afe and well fortified harbour of Angra,
before the Engli&s;h fleet could overtake them. E&s;&s;ex inter|cepted only
three &s;hips; which, however, were &s;o rich as to pay all the charges of the
expedition.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;es of this mi&s;carriage of E&s;&s;ex's enterprize,
were much canva&s;&s;ed in England, upon the return of the fleet; and tho' the
courtiers took party differ|ently, as they affected either E&s;&s;ex or
Raleigh, the people, in general, who bore an extreme affection to the
gallantry, &s;pirit, and genero&s;ity of the former, were inclined to ju&s;tify
every circum&s;tance of his conduct. The Queen, who loved the one as much as
&s;he e&s;teemed the other, maintained a kind of neutrality, and endeavoured to
&s;hare her favours with an impartial hand between the parties. Sir Robert
Cecil, &s;econd &s;on to lord Burleigh, was a courtier of very promi&s;ing
hopes, much connected with Raleigh; and &s;he made him &s;ecretary of &s;tate,
in|&s;tead of Sir Thomas Bodley, whom E&s;&s;ex recommended for that office.
But not to di&s;gu&s;t E&s;&s;ex by this preference, &s;he promoted him to the
dignity of earl mar|&s;hal of England, an office which had been vacant ever
&s;ince the death of the earl of Shrew&s;bury. E&s;&s;ex might perceive from
this conduct, that &s;he never in|tended to give him the entire a&s;cendant
over his rivals, and might learn thence the nece&s;&s;ity of moderation and
caution. But his temper was too high for &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion; his behaviour too
open and candid to practice the arts of a court; and his free &s;allies, while
they rendered him only more amiable in the eyes of good judges, gave his
enemies many advantages again&s;t him.</P>

keeper, to inform this a&s;&s;embly of the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;up|ply. She
&s;aid, that the wars formerly waged in Europe, had commonly been con|ducted by
the parties without farther view than to gain a few towns, or at mo&s;t a
province, from each other; but the object of the pre&s;ent ho&s;tilities, on
the part of Spain, was no other than utterly to bereave England of her
religion, her li|berty, and her independance: That the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings,
however, &s;he had hitherto been enabled to pre&s;erve, in &s;pite of the
devil, the pope, and the Spani&s;h tyrant, and all the mi&s;chievous de&s;igns
of all her enemies: That in this conte&s;t &s;he had di&s;bur&s;ed a &s;um
treble to all the parliamentary &s;upplies granted her; and be&s;ides expending
her ordinary revenues, had been obliged to &s;ell many of the crown lands: And
that &s;he could not doubt, but her &s;ubjects, in a cau&s;e where their own
honour and intere&s;t were &s;o deeply concerned, would willingly contribute to
&s;uch moderate taxations as would be found requi&s;ite for their common
defence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 525, 527. Town&s;end, p.

<P>THE commons, this &s;e&s;&s;ion, ventured to engage in two
controver&s;ies about forms with the hou&s;e of peers; a prelude to tho&s;e
encroachments which, as they a&s;&s;umed more courage, they afterwards made
upon the prerogatives of the crown. They complained, that the lords failed in
civility to them, by receiving their <PB N="670" REF="275"> me&s;&s;ages
&s;itting with their hats on; and that the keeper returned an an&s;wer in the
&s;ame negligent po&s;ture: But the upper hou&s;e proved, to their full

whether the paper was white, black, or brown. The commons were offended with

<P><MILESTONE N="1598" UNIT="year"> ELIZABETH had rea&s;on to
&s;ore&s;ee, that parliamentary &s;upplies would now be|come more nece&s;&s;ary
to her than ever; and that the chief burthen of the war with Spain would
thenceforth lie on England. Henry had received an overture for a peace with
Philip; but before he would proceed to a negociation, he gave intelligence of
it to his allies, the Queen and the States; that, if po&s;&s;ible, a
pa|cification might be made by common con&s;ent and agreement. The&s;e two
powers &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to France, in order to remon&s;trate again&s;t
peace with Spain; the Queen, Sir Robert Cecil, and Henry Herbert; the States,
Ju&s;tin Na&s;&s;au, and John Barnevelt. Henry &s;aid to the&s;e mini&s;ters,
that his mo&s;t early education <PB N="671" REF="276"> had been amid&s;t war
and danger, and he had pa&s;&s;ed the whole cour&s;e of his life either in arms
or in military preparations: That after the proofs which he had given of his
alacrity in the field, no one could doubt, but he would willingly, for his
part, have continued in a cour&s;e of life, to which he was now habi|tuated,
till the common enemy was reduced to &s;uch a condition as no longer to give
umbrage either to him or to his allies: That no private intere&s;t of his own,
not even that of his people, nothing but the mo&s;t inevitable nece&s;&s;ity,
could ever induce him to think of a &s;eparate peace with Philip, or make him
embrace mea&s;ures which were not entirely formed with the approbation of all
his confede|rates: That his kingdom, torne with the convul&s;ions and civil
wars of near half a century, required &s;ome interval of repo&s;e, ere it could
reach a condition in which it might &s;u&s;tain it&s;elf, much more &s;upport
its allies: That after the minds of his &s;ubjects were compo&s;ed to
tranquillity and accu&s;tomed to obedience, after his finances were brought
into order, and after agriculture and the arts were re|&s;tored, France,
in&s;tead of being a burthen, as at pre&s;ent, to her confederates, would be
able to lend them effectual &s;uccours, and amply to repay them all the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance which &s;he had received during her calamities: And that if
the ambi|tion of Spain would not at pre&s;ent grant them &s;uch terms as they
&s;hould think rea&s;onable, he hoped, that, in a little time, he &s;hould
attain &s;uch a &s;ituation as would enable him to mediate more effectually,
and with more deci&s;ive autho|rity, in their behalf.</P>
<P>THE amba&s;&s;adors were &s;en&s;ible, that the&s;e rea&s;ons
were not feigned; and they therefore remon&s;trated with the le&s;s vehemence
again&s;t the mea&s;ures which, they &s;aw, Henry was determined to pur&s;ue.
The States knew, that that monarch was intere&s;ted never to permit their final
ruin; and having received private a&s;&s;ur|ances, that he would &s;till,
notwith&s;tanding the peace, give them a&s;&s;i&s;tance, both of men and money,
they were well plea&s;ed to remain on terms of amity with him. His greate&s;t
concern was to give &s;atisfaction to Elizabeth for this breach of treaty. He
had a cordial e&s;teem for that prince&s;s&punc; a &s;ympathy of manners, and a
gratitude for the extradinary favours which he had received from her, during
his greate&s;t difficulties: And he u&s;ed every expedient to apologize and
atone for that mea&s;ure, which nece&s;&s;ity extorted from him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace of Vervins.</NOTE> But as Spain
refu&s;ed to treat with the Dutch as a free &s;tate, and Elizabeth would not
negociate without her ally, Henry found him&s;elf obliged to conclude, at
Vervins, a &s;eparate peace, by which he recovered po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all
the places &s;eized by Spain during the cour&s;e of the civil wars, and
procured him&s;elf leizure to attend to the dome&s;tic &s;ettle|ment of his
kingdom. His capacity for the arts of peace were not inferior to his military
talents; and, in a little time, by his frugality, order, and wi&s;e
go|vernment, <PB N="672" REF="277"> he rai&s;ed France, from the de&s;olation
and mi&s;ery in which &s;he was at pre&s;ent involved, to a more flouri&s;hing
condition than &s;he had ever before en|joyed.</P>
<P>THE Queen knew, that it would be al&s;o in her power, whenever
&s;he plea&s;ed, to conclude the war on equitable terms, and that Philip,
having no preten&s;ions upon her, would be glad to free him&s;elf from an enemy
who had foiled him in every conte&s;t, and who had it &s;till &s;o much in her
power to make him feel the weight of her arms. Some of her wi&s;e&s;t
coun&s;ellors, particularly the lord trea&s;urer, advi&s;ed her to embrace
pacific mea&s;ures; and &s;et before her the advantages of tranquil|lity,
&s;ecurity, and frugality, as more con&s;iderable than any &s;ucce&s;s which
could attend the greate&s;t victories. But that high-&s;pirited prince&s;s,
tho' &s;he was at fir&s;t aver&s;e to the war, &s;eemed now to have attained
&s;uch an a&s;cendant over the enemy, that &s;he was unwilling to &s;top the
cour&s;e of her pro&s;perous fortune. She con&s;i|dered, that her &s;ituation,
and her pa&s;t victories, had given her entire &s;ecurity again&s;t any
dangerous inva&s;ion; and the war mu&s;t henceforth be conducted by &s;udden
enterprizes, and naval expeditions, in which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an
undoubted &s;uperiority: That the weak condition of Philip in the Indies opened
to her the view of the mo&s;t de&s;irable advantages; and the yearly return of
his trea&s;ure by &s;ea, afforded a continual pro&s;pect of important, tho'
more temporary, &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es: That, after his peace with France, if &s;he
al&s;o &s;hould con&s;ent to an ac|commodation, he would be able to turn all
his force again&s;t the revolted pro|vinces of the Netherlands, which, tho'
they had &s;urprizingly increa&s;ed their pow|er by commerce and good
government, were &s;till unable, if not &s;upported by their confederates, to
maintain the war again&s;t &s;o mighty a monarchy: And that as her defence of
that commonwealth was the original ground of the quarrel, it was un&s;afe, as
well as di&s;honourable, to abandon their cau&s;e, till &s;he had placed them
in a &s;tate of greater &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>THESE rea&s;ons were frequently inculcated on her by the earl of
E&s;&s;ex, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion for glory, as well as his military talents, made
him earne&s;tly de&s;ire the continuance of that war from which he expected to
reap &s;o much advantage and di&s;tinction. The rival&s;hip between this
nobleman and lord Burleigh, made each of them in&s;i&s;t the more
&s;trenuou&s;ly on his own councils; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> and as E&s;&s;ex's
per&s;on was agreeable to the Queen, as well as his advice conformable to her
inclinations, the favourite &s;eemed daily to acquire an a&s;cendant over the
mini&s;ter. Had he been endowed with caution and &s;elf-command, equal to his
&s;hining qualities, he would have &s;o riveted him&s;elf in the Queen's
con&s;idence, that none of his enemies had ever been able to impeach his
credit: But his lofty &s;pirit could ill &s;ubmit to that implicit deference
which her temper required, and which &s;he had ever been ac|cu&s;tomed 
<PB N="673" REF="278"> to receive from all her &s;ubjects. Being once engaged
in a di&s;pute with her, about the choice of a governor for Ireland, he was
&s;o heated in the argu|ment, that he entirely forgot the rules both of duty
and civility; and turned his back upon her in a contemptuous manner. Her anger,
which was naturally prompt and violent, ro&s;e at this provocation; and &s;he
in&s;tantly gave him a box in the ear; adding a pa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;&s;ion,
&s;uited to his impertinence. In&s;tead of recollecting him&s;elf, and making
the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions due to her &s;ex and &s;tation, he clapped his hand on
his &s;word, and &s;wore he would not bear &s;uch u&s;age, were it from Henry
the eighth him&s;elf; and, in a great pa&s;&s;ion, he immediately with|drew
from court. Egerton, the chancellor, who loved E&s;&s;ex, exhorted him to
repair his indi&s;cretion by proper acknowlegements; and entreated him not to
give that triumph to his enemies, that affliction to his friends, as mu&s;t
en&s;ue by his &s;upporting a conte&s;t with his &s;overeign, and de&s;erting
the &s;ervice of his country: But E&s;&s;ex was deeply &s;tung with the
di&s;honour which he had received; and &s;eem|ed to think, that an in&s;ult
which might be pardoned a woman, was become a mortal affront when it came from
his &s;overeign. 
<Q REND="inline">"If the vile&s;t of all indignities," &s;aid he,

that in &s;ome ca&s;es I mu&s;t appeal from all earthly judges: And if in any,
then &s;urely in this, when the highe&s;t judge
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> earth has impo&s;ed on me the
heavie&s;t puni&s;hment without trial or hearing. Since then I mu&s;t either
an&s;wer your lord&s;hip's argument, or el&s;e for&s;ake mine own ju&s;t
defence. I will force mine aching head to do me &s;ervice for an hour. I mu&s;t
fir&s;t deny my di&s;content, which was forced, to be an hu|mourous
di&s;content; and that it was un&s;ea&s;onable or is of &s;o long continuing,
your lord&s;hip &s;hould ra|ther condole with me than expo&s;tulate: Natural
&s;ea&s;ons are expected here below; but violent and unrea&s;onable &s;torms
come from above: There is no tempe&s;t equal to the pa&s;&s;ionate indignation
of a prince; nor yet at any time &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable as when it &s;ighteth on
tho&s;e that might expect a harve&s;t of their careful and painful labours. He
that is once wounded, mu&s;t needs feel &s;mart, till his hurt is cured, or the
part hurt become &s;en&s;ele&s;s: But cure I expect none, her maje&s;ty's heart
being ob|durate again&s;t me; and be without &s;en&s;e I cannot, being of
fle&s;h and blood. But, &s;ay you, I may aim at the end: I do more than aim;
for I &s;ee an end of all my fortunes, I have &s;et an end to all my de&s;ires.
In this cour&s;e do I any thing for my enemies? When I was at court, I found
them ab&s;olute; and, therefore, I had rather they &s;hould triumph alone, than
have me attendant upon their chariots. Or do I leave my friends? When I was a
courtier, I could yield them no fruit of my love unto them; and now, that I am
a hermit, they &s;hall bear no envy for their love towards me. Or do I
for&s;ake my&s;elf, becau&s;e I do enjoy my&s;elf? Or do I overthrow my
fortunes, becau&s;e I build not a fortune of paper walls, which every puff of
wind bloweth down? Or do I ruinate mine ho|nour, becau&s;e I leave following
the pur&s;uit, or wearing the fal&s;e badge or mark of the &s;hadow of honour?
Do I give courage or comfort to the foreign foe, becau&s;e I re&s;erve my&s;elf
to encounter with him? Or becau&s;e I keep my heart from bu&s;ine&s;s, tho' I
cannot keep my fortune from declin|ing? No, no, my good lord, I give every one
of the&s;e con&s;iderations its due weight; and the more I weigh them, the more
I find my&s;elf ju&s;tified from offending in any of them. As for the two
la&s;t objections, that I for&s;ake my country, when it hath mo&s;t need of me,
and fail in that indi&s;&s;olu|ble duty which I owe to my &s;overeign; I
an&s;wer, that if my country had at this time any need of my public &s;ervice,
her maje&s;ty, that governeth it, would not have driven me to a private life. I
am tied to my country by two bonds; one public, to di&s;charge carefully and
indu&s;triou&s;ly that tru&s;t which is committed to me; the other private, to
&s;acrifice for it my life and carca&s;s, which hath been nouri&s;hed in it. Of
the fir&s;t I am free, being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, di&s;charged, and di&s;abled by
her maje&s;ty: Of the other, nothing can free me but death; and therefore no
occa&s;ion of my performance &s;hall &s;ooner offer it&s;elf but I &s;hall meet
it half way. The indi&s;&s;oluble duty which I owe unto her maje&s;ty, is only
the duty of allegiance, which I never have, nor ever can fail in: The duty of
attendance, is no indi&s;&s;oluble duty. I owe her maje&s;ty the duty of an
earl and of lord mar&s;hal of England. I have been content to do her maje&s;ty
the &s;ervice of a clerk; but I can never &s;erve her as a villain or a
&s;lave. But yet you &s;ay I mu&s;t give way unto the time. So I do; for now
that I &s;ee the &s;torm come, I have put my&s;elf into the harbour.

his own indi&s;cretion could thenceforth have &s;haken his well e&s;tabli&s;hed

None of her other inclinations or af|fections could ever overcome her
confidence in &s;o u&s;eful a coun&s;ellor; and as he had had the genero&s;ity
or good &s;en&s;e to pay a&s;&s;iduous court to her, during her &s;i&s;ter's
reign, when it was dangerous to appear her friend, &s;he thought her&s;elf

indefatigable application in bu&s;ine&s;s: Virtues, which, if they do not
always enable a man to ri&s;e to high &s;tations, do certainly qualify him
be&s;t for filling them. Of all the Queen's mini&s;ters he was the only one who
left a con&s;iderable fortune to his po&s;terity; a fortune not acquired by

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1599" UNIT="year"> THO' the dominion of the
Engli&s;h over Ireland, had been e&s;tabli&s;hed above four centuries, it may
&s;afely be affirmed, that their authority had hi|therto been little more than
nominal. The Iri&s;h princes and nobles, di|vided among them&s;elves, readily
paid the exterior marks of obei&s;ance to a power which they were not able to
re&s;i&s;t; but, as no durable force was ever kept on foot to retain them to
their duty, they relap&s;ed &s;till into their former &s;tate of indepen|dance.
Too weak to introduce order and obedience among the rude inhabitants, the
Engli&s;h authority was yet &s;ufficient to check the growth of any
enterprizing genius among the natives: And, tho' it could be&s;tow no true form
of civil govern|ment, <PB N="677" REF="282"> it was able to prevent the ri&s;e
of any &s;uch form, from the internal com|bination or &s;ubjection of the
Iri&s;h.</P>
<P>MOST of the Engli&s;h in&s;titutions likewi&s;e, by which that
i&s;land was governed, were to the la&s;t degree ab&s;urd, and &s;uch as no
&s;tate before had ever thought of, for the pre&s;erving dominion over its
conquered provinces.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h nation, all on fire for the project of &s;ubduing
France, a project, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s was the mo&s;t improbable, and would to
them have proved the mo&s;t pernicious; neglected all other enterprizes, to
which their &s;ituation &s;o &s;trongly in|vited them, and which, in time,
would have brought them an acce&s;&s;ion of riches, grandeur, and &s;ecurity.
The &s;mall army which they maintained in Ireland, they never &s;upplied
regularly with pay; and as no money could be levied from the i&s;land, which
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed none, they gave their &s;oldiers the privilege of free
quarter upon the natives. Rapine and in&s;olence inflamed the hatred, which
prevailed be|tween the conquerors and the conquered: Want of &s;ecurity among
the Iri&s;h, in|troducing de&s;pair, nouri&s;hed &s;till farther the &s;loth,
&s;o natural to that uncultivated people.</P>
<P>BUT the Engli&s;h carried farther their ill-judged tyranny.
In&s;tead of inviting the Iri&s;h to adopt the more civilized cu&s;toms of
their conquerors, they even re|fu&s;ed, tho' earne&s;tly &s;ollicited, to
communicate to them the privilege of their laws, and every where marked them
out as aliens and as enemies. Thrown out of the protection of ju&s;tice, the
natives could find &s;ecurity no where but in force; and flying the
neighbourhood of cities, which they could not approach with &s;afety, they
&s;heltered them&s;elves in their mar&s;hes and fore&s;ts from the in&s;olence
of their inhuman ma&s;ters. Being treated like wild bea&s;ts, they became
&s;uch; and join|ing the ardor of revenge to their yet untamed barbarity, they
grew every day more intractable and dangerous.</P>
<P>AS the Engli&s;h princes e&s;teemed the conque&s;t of the
di&s;per&s;ed Iri&s;h to be more the object of time and patience than the
&s;ource of military glory, they willingly delegated that office to private
adventurers, who inli&s;ting &s;oldiers at their own charge, conquered
provinces of that i&s;land, which they converted to their own profit. Separate
juri&s;dictions and principalities were e&s;tabli&s;hed by the&s;e lordly
con|querors: The power of peace and war was a&s;&s;umed: Military law was
exerci&s;ed over the Iri&s;h, whom they &s;ubdued, and, by degrees, over the
Engli&s;h, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they conquered: And, after their
dominion had once taken root, deem|ing the Engli&s;h in&s;titutions le&s;s
favourable to barbarous empire, they degenerated into mere Iri&s;h, and
abandoned the garb, language, manners and laws of their native country.</P>
<P><PB N="678" REF="283"> BY all this imprudent conduct of England,
the natives of its dependant &s;tate, remained &s;till in that abject
condition, into which the northern and we&s;tern parts of Europe were &s;unk,
before they received civility and &s;lavery from the refined policy and
irre&s;i&s;tible bravery of Rome. Even at the end of the &s;ixteenth cen|tury,
when every chri&s;tian nation was cultivating with ardour every civil art of
life, that i&s;land, lying in a temperate climate, enjoying a fertile &s;oil,
acce&s;&s;ible in its &s;ituation, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of innumerable harbours,
was &s;till, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e ad|vantages, inhabited by a people,
who&s;e cu&s;toms and manners approached nearer tho&s;e of &s;avages than of
barbarians.</P>
<P>AS the brutality and ignorance of the Iri&s;h was extreme, they
were &s;unk below the reach of that curio&s;ity and love of novelty, by which
every other people in Europe had been &s;eized at the beginning of that
century, and which had engaged them in innovations and religious di&s;putes,
with which they were &s;till &s;o violently agitated. The antient
&s;uper&s;tition, the practices and ob&s;ervances of their fathers, mingled and
polluted with many wild opinions, &s;till maintained an un&s;haken em|pire over
them; and the example alone of the Engli&s;h was &s;ufficient to render the
reformation odious to the prejudiced and di&s;contented Iri&s;h. The old
oppo&s;ition of manners, laws, and intere&s;t, was now inflamed by religious
antipathy; and the &s;ubduing and civilizing that country &s;eemed to become
every day more difficult and more impracticable.</P>
<P>THE animo&s;ity again&s;t the Engli&s;h was carried &s;o far by
the Iri&s;h, that, in an in&s;urrection, rai&s;ed by two &s;ons of the earl of
Clanricard, they put to the &s;word the whole inhabitants of the town of
Athenry, tho' Iri&s;h; becau&s;e they began to conform them&s;elves to
Engli&s;h cu&s;toms and in&s;titutions, and had embraced a more cultivated and
civilized form of life, than had been practi&s;ed by their bar|barous
ance&s;tors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 457.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE u&s;ual revenue of Ireland amounted only to &s;ix thou&s;and
pounds a year<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of the Sydneys, vol. I. p.

extraordinary emergencies, was augmented to two thou&s;and<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 542. Sydney, vol. I. p. 65, 109, 183, 184.</NOTE>. No

&s;ubduing a mutinous kingdom, &s;erved rather to pro|voke the natives, and to
excite tho&s;e frequent in&s;urrections and rebellions, which &s;till farther

the hands of &s;ome Scotch i&s;landers, who commonly infe&s;ted tho&s;e parts
by their incur&s;ions. The Scotch, who retained a quarrel again&s;t him on
account of former injuries, violated the laws of ho&s;pitality, and murdered
him in a fe&s;ti|val, to which they had invited him. He was a man equally noted
for his pride, his violences, his debaucheries, and his hatred of the Engli&s;h

Such was the life led by this haughty barbarian, who &s;corned the title of
earl of Tyrone, which Elizabeth in|tended to have re&s;tored to him, and who
a&s;&s;umed the rank and appellation of King of Ul&s;ter. He u&s;ed al&s;o to
&s;ay, that tho' the Queen was his &s;overeign lady, he never made peace with
her but at her &s;eeking<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 321.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR Henry Sidney was one of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t active
governors whom Ire|land had enjoyed for &s;everal reigns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 350.</NOTE>; and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his authority
eleven years; during which time, he &s;truggled with many difficulties, and
made &s;ome progre&s;s in repre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e di&s;orders, which had become
inveterate among that people. The earl of De&s;mond, in 1569, gave him
di&s;turbance from the hereditary ani|mo&s;ity which prevailed between that
nobleman and the earl of Ormond, who was de&s;cended from the only family,
e&s;tabli&s;hed in Ireland, that had ever &s;teddily maintained its loyalty to
the Engli&s;h crown<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 424.</NOTE>. The
earl of Thomond, in 1570, attempted a rebellion in Connaught, but was obliged
to fly into France, before his de&s;igns were ripe for execution. Stukeley,
another fugitive, found &s;uch credit with the pope, Gregory the 13th, that he
flattered his holine&s;s with the pro&s;pect of making his nephew, Buon

Elizabeth, he was found to po&s;&s;e&s;s <PB N="680" REF="285"> too little
intere&s;t for executing tho&s;e high promi&s;es, which he had made to that

expedition again&s;t the Moors.</P>
<P>LORD Gray &s;ucceeded Sydney in the government of Ireland; and,
in 1579, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a new rebellion of the earl of De&s;mond, tho'
&s;upported by a body of Spaniards and Italians. The rebellion of the Bourks
followed a few years after|wards; occa&s;ioned by the &s;trict and equitable

endeavoured to repre&s;s the tyranny of the chieftains over their
va&s;&s;als<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 720.</NOTE>. The Queen, finding
Ireland &s;o burthen&s;ome to her, tried &s;everal expedients for reducing it
to a &s;tate of greater order and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. She encouraged the earl of
E&s;&s;ex, father to that nobleman, who was afterwards her favourite, to
attempt the &s;ubduing and planting Clandeboy, Ferny and other territories,

expedient, employed in the government of Ireland, was that made u&s;e of in
1585 by Sir John Perrot, at that time lord deputy: He put arms into the hands
of the Iri&s;h inhabitants of Ul&s;ter, in order to enable them, without the

the invitations of Philip, joined to their zeal for the catholic religion,
engaged many of the gentry to &s;erve in the Low Country wars; and thus
Ireland, being pro|vided both of officers and &s;oldiers, of di&s;cipline and

govern|ment. He was noted for the vices of perfidy and cruelty, &s;o common
among uncultivated nations; and was al&s;o eminent for courage, a virtue, which
their di&s;orderly cour&s;e of life requires, and which, notwith&s;tanding,
being un&s;upported <PB N="681" REF="286"> by the principle of honour, is
commonly more precarious among them, than among a civilized people. Tyrone,
actuated by this &s;pirit, &s;ecretly fomented the di&s;contents of the
Maguires, Odonnels, O'Rourks, Macmahons, and other rebels; yet tru&s;ting to
the influence of his deceitful oaths and profe&s;&s;ions, he put him&s;elf into
the hands of Sir William Ru&s;&s;el, who, in the year 1594, was &s;ent over
lord deputy into Ireland. Contrary to the advice and prote&s;tation of Sir
Henry Bagnal, mar&s;hal of the army, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and returning to
his own coun|try, he embraced the re&s;olution of rai&s;ing an open rebellion,
and of relying no longer on the lenity or inexperience of the Engli&s;h
government. He entered into a corre&s;pondence with Spain: He procured thence a
&s;upply of arms and ammunition: And having united all the Iri&s;h chieftains
in a dependance upon him, he began to be regarded as a formidable enemy.</P>
<P>THE native Iri&s;h were &s;o mi&s;erably poor, that their
country afforded few other commodities but cattle and oatmeal, which were
ea&s;ily de&s;troyed or driven away on the approach of the enemy; and as
Elizabeth was aver&s;e to the expence requi|&s;ite for &s;upporting her armies,
the Engli&s;h found much difficulty in pu&s;hing their advantages, and in
pur&s;uing the rebels into the bogs, woods, and other fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, to
which they retreated. The&s;e motives made Sir John Norris, who commanded the
Engli&s;h army, the more ready to hearken to any propo&s;als of accommodation
made him by Tyrone; and after the war was &s;pun out by the&s;e artifices for
&s;ome years, that gallant Engli&s;hman, finding that he had been deceived by
treacherous promi&s;es, and that he had performed nothing worthy of his antient
reputation, was &s;eized with a langui&s;hing di&s;temper, and died of vexation
and di&s;content. Sir Henry Bagnal, who &s;ucceeded him in the command, was
&s;till more unfortunate. As he advanced to relieve the &s;ort of Black-water,
be&s;ieged by the rebels, he was &s;urrounded in di&s;advantageous ground; his
&s;oldiers, di&s;+couraged by their powder's accidentally taking fire, were put
to flight; and, tho' the pur&s;uit was &s;topt by Montacute, who commanded the
Engli&s;h hor&s;e, fifteen hundred men, together with the general him&s;elf,
were left dead upon the &s;pot. This victory, &s;o unu&s;ual to the Iri&s;h,
mightily rai&s;ed their &s;pirits, &s;up|plied them with arms and ammunition,
and exalted the reputation of Tyrone, who a&s;&s;umed the character of the
deliverer of his country, and patron of Iri&s;h liberty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cox, p. 415.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h council were now &s;en&s;ible that the rebellion
in Ireland was come to a dangerous head, and that the former temporizing arts,
of granting truces and pacifications to the rebels, and of allowing them to
purcha&s;e pardons by re&s;ign|ing part of the plunder, acquired during their
in&s;urrections, &s;erved only to encou|rage <PB N="682" REF="287"> the
&s;pirit of mutiny and di&s;order among them. It was therefore re&s;olved to
pu&s;h the war by vigorous mea&s;ures; and the Queen ca&s;t her eye on Charles
Blount, lord Mountjoy, as a man, who, tho' hitherto le&s;s accu&s;tomed to arms
than to books and literature, was endowed, &s;he thought, with talents equal to
that undertaking. But the young earl of E&s;&s;ex, ambitious of glory, and
de&s;irous of obtaining this government for him&s;elf, oppo&s;ed the choice of
Mount|joy; and repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of appointing, for that
important employment, &s;ome per&s;on more experienced in war than this
nobleman, more practi&s;ed in bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and of higher quality and
reputation. By this de&s;cription, he was under|&s;tood to mean him&s;elf<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. IV. p. 512.</NOTE>; and no &s;ooner was
his de&s;ire known, to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that government, than his
enemies, even more zealou&s;ly than his friends, con|&s;pired to render his
wi&s;hes effectual. Many of his friends thought, that he ne|ver &s;hould
con&s;ent, except for a very &s;hort time, to accept of employments which
mu&s;t remove him from court, and prevent him from cultivating that per|&s;onal
inclination, which the Queen &s;o vi&s;ibly bore him<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cabba&s;a, p. 79.</NOTE>. His enemies hoped, that if, by his
ab&s;ence, &s;he had once leizure to forget the charms of his per&s;on and
conver&s;ation, his impatient and lofty demeanor would &s;oon di&s;gu&s;t a
prince&s;s, who u&s;ually exacted &s;uch profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and implicit
obedience from all her &s;ervants. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">E&s;&s;ex &s;ent over to Ireland.</NOTE> But
E&s;&s;ex was incapable of entering into &s;uch cautious views; and even
Elizabeth, who was extremely de&s;irous of &s;ubdoing the Iri&s;h rebels, and
who was much prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of E&s;&s;ex's genius, readily
agreed to appoint him governor of Ireland, under the title of lord lieutenant.
The more to en|courage him in his undertaking, &s;he granted him by his patent
more exten&s;ive authority than had ever before been conferred on any
lieutenant; the power of carrying on or fini&s;hing the war as he plea&s;ed, of
pardoning the rebels, and of filling all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable employments
of the kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 366.</NOTE>. And to
en&s;ure him of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he levied a numerous army of &s;ixteen
thou&s;and foot and thir|teen hundred hor&s;e, which &s;he afterwards augmented
to twenty thou&s;and foot and two thou&s;and hor&s;e: A force, which, it was
apprehended, would be able, in one campaign, to overwhelm the rebels, and make
an entire conque&s;t of Ire|land. Nor did E&s;&s;ex's enemies, the earl of
Nottingham, lord admiral, Sir Ro|bert Cecil, &s;ecretary, Sir Walter Raleigh,
and lord Cobham, throw any ob&s;tacles in the way of the&s;e preparations; but
hoped, that the higher the Queen's ex|pectations were rai&s;ed of &s;ucce&s;s,
the more difficult it would be for the event to corre&s;pond to them. In a like
view, they rather &s;econded, than oppo&s;ed, tho&s;e exalted encomiums, which
E&s;&s;ex's numerous and &s;anguine friends di&s;per&s;ed, of 
<PB N="683" REF="288"> his high genius, of his elegant endowments, his heroic
courage, his unbounded genero&s;ity, and his noble birth; nor were they
di&s;plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve that pa&s;|&s;ionate fondne&s;s, which the people
every where expre&s;&s;ed for this nobleman. The&s;e artful politicians had
&s;tudied his character; and finding, that his open and undaunted &s;pirit, if
taught temper and re&s;erve from oppo&s;ition, mu&s;t become in|vincible, they
re&s;olved rather to give full breath to tho&s;e &s;ails, which were al|ready
too much expanded, and to pu&s;h him upon dangers, of which he &s;eemed to make
&s;uch &s;mall account<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden. O&s;borne, p
371.</NOTE>. And the better to make advantage of his indi&s;|cretions, &s;pies
were &s;et upon all his actions and even expre&s;&s;ions; and his vehe|ment
&s;pirit, which, while he was in the mid&s;t of the court and environed by his
rivals, was unacquainted with di&s;gui&s;e, could not fail, after he thought
him&s;elf &s;urrounded by none but friends, to give a pretence for malignant
&s;u&s;picions and con&s;tructions.</P>
<P>Essex left London in the month of March, attended by the
acclamations of the populace, and what did him more honour, accompanied by a
numerous train of nobility and gentry, who, from affection to his per&s;on, had
attached them|&s;elves to all his fortunes, and propo&s;ed to acquire fame and
military experience under &s;o renowned a commander. The fir&s;t act of
authority, which he exerci&s;ed, after his arrival in Ireland, was an
indi&s;cretion, but of the generous kind; and in both the&s;e re&s;pects,
&s;uitable to his character. He appointed his intimate friend, the earl of
Southampton, general of the hor&s;e; a nobleman, who had di&s;plea&s;ed the
Queen by &s;ecretly marrying without her con&s;ent, and whom &s;he had
therefore enjoined E&s;&s;ex not to employ in any command under him. She no
&s;ooner heard of this in&s;tance of di&s;obedience than &s;he reprimanded him,
and ordered him to recal his commi&s;&s;ion to Southampton. But E&s;&s;ex, who
had imagined, that &s;ome rea&s;ons, which he oppo&s;ed to her fir&s;t
injunctions, had convinced her, had the imprudence to remon&s;trate again&s;t
the&s;e &s;econd orders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II p.

could be prevailed on to di&s;place his friend.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His ill &s;ucce&s;s.</NOTE> ESSEX, on his
landing at Dublin, had deliberated with the Iri&s;h council, con|cerning the
proper methods of carrying on war again&s;t the rebels; and here he was guilty
of a capital error, which was the ruin of his enterprize. He had al|ways, while
in England, blamed the conduct of former commanders, who art|fully protracted
the war, who harra&s;&s;ed their troops in &s;mall enterprizes, and who, by
agreeing to truces and temporary pacifications with the rebels, had given them
leizure to recruit their broken forces<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> bacon, vol. IV. p.

Tyrone, the capital enemy; and his in&s;tructions had been drawn agreeable to
the&s;e his de|clared intentions and re&s;olutions. But the Iri&s;h
coun&s;ellors per&s;uaded him, that the &s;ea&s;on was too early for the
enterprize, and that as the mora&s;&s;es, in which the Iri&s;h u&s;ually
&s;heltered them&s;elves, would not, as yet, be penetrable to the Engli&s;h
forces, it would be better to employ the pre&s;ent time in an expedition into
Mun|&s;ter. Their &s;ecret rea&s;on for this advice was, that many of them
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed e&s;tates in that province, and were de&s;irous to have the
enemy di&s;lodged from their neigh|bourhood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's

induced them to give this council, made them &s;oon after di&s;own it, when
they found the bad con&s;equences with which it was attended<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 140.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ESSEX obliged all the rebels of Mun&s;ter either to &s;ubmit or
to fly into the neighbouring provinces: But as the Iri&s;h, from the
greatne&s;s of the Queen's preparations, had concluded, that &s;he intended to
reduce them to total &s;ubjection, or even utterly to exterminate them, they
con&s;idered their pre&s;ent defence as a common cau&s;e; and the Engli&s;h
forces were no &s;ooner withdrawn, than the in|habitants of Mun&s;ter
relap&s;ed into rebellion, and renewed their confederacy with their other
countrymen. The army, meanwhile, by the fatigue of long and te|dious marches,
and by the influence of the climate, was become extreme &s;ickly; and on their
return to Dublin, about the middle of July, were &s;uprizingly di|mini&s;hed in
number. Their courage was even much abated: For tho' they had prevailed in
&s;ome le&s;&s;er enterprizes, as again&s;t the lord Cahir and others; yet had
they &s;ometimes met with a more &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance than they expected from
the Iri&s;h, whom they were wont to de&s;pi&s;e; and as they were raw troops
and unex|perienced, a con&s;iderable body of them had been put to flight at the
Glins, by an inferior number of the enemy: E&s;&s;ex was &s;o enraged at this
mi&s;behaviour, that he ca&s;hiered all the officers, and decimated the private
men<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cox, p. 421.</NOTE>. But this in|&s;tance of
&s;everity, tho' nece&s;&s;ary, had intimidated the &s;oldiers, and had
encrea&s;ed their aver&s;ion to the pre&s;ent &s;ervice.</P>
<P>THE Queen was extremely di&s;gu&s;ted, when &s;he heard, that
&s;o con&s;iderable a part of the &s;ea&s;on was con&s;umed in the&s;e
frivolous enterprizes; and was &s;till more &s;urprized, that E&s;&s;ex
per&s;evered in the &s;ame practice, which he had &s;o much condemned in
others, and which he knew to be &s;o much contrary to her purpo&s;e and
intention. That nobleman, in order to give his troops leizure to recruit from
their &s;ickne&s;s and fatigue, marched with a &s;mall body of fifteen hundred
men into the county of Ophelie again&s;t the O'Connors and O'Mores, 
<PB N="685" REF="290"> whom he forced to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: But on his return
to Dublin, he found the army &s;o extremely dimini&s;hed, that he wrote to the
Engli&s;h council an account of his condition, and informed them, that if he
received not immediately a reinforcement of two thou&s;and men, it would be
impo&s;&s;ible for him this &s;ea&s;on to attempt any thing again&s;t Tyrone.
That there might be no pretence for farther inactivity, the Queen immediately
&s;ent over the number demanded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol.
II. p. 430. Cox, p. 421.</NOTE>; and E&s;&s;ex began at la&s;t to a&s;&s;emble
his forces for the expedition into Ul&s;ter. The army was &s;o ex|tremely
aver&s;e to this enterprize, and terrified with the reputation of Tyrone, that
many of them counterfeited &s;ickne&s;s, many of them de&s;erted<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 112, 113.</NOTE>; and
E&s;&s;ex found, that after leaving the nece&s;&s;ary garri&s;ons, he could
&s;carce lead four thou|&s;and men again&s;t the rebels. He marched, however,
with this &s;mall army; but was &s;oon &s;en&s;ible, that, in &s;o advanced a
&s;ea&s;on, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to effectuate any thing
again&s;t an enemy, who, tho' &s;uperior in number, were determined to avoid
every deci&s;ive action. He hearkened, therefore, to a me&s;|&s;age &s;ent him
by Tyrone, who de&s;ired a conference; and a place, near the two camps, was
accordingly appointed. The generals met without any of their at|tendants, and a
river ran between them, into which Tyrone entered to the depth of his &s;addle:
But E&s;&s;ex &s;tood on the oppo&s;ite bank. After half an hour's con|ference,
where Tyrone behaved with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re&s;pect to the lord
lieutenant, a ce&s;&s;ation of arms was concluded to the fir&s;t of May,
renewable from &s;ix weeks to &s;ix weeks; but which might be broke off by
either party upon a fortnight's warning<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p.

which that rebel had in&s;erted many unrea&s;onable and exorbitant conditions:
And there appeared afterwards &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that he had here
com|menced a very unju&s;tifiable corre&s;pondence with the enemy<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 307. State Trials. Bacon, vol.

<P>SO unexpected an i&s;&s;ue of an enterprize, the greate&s;t and
mo&s;t expen&s;ive which Elizabeth had ever undertaken, provoked her extremely
again&s;t E&s;&s;ex; and this di&s;gu&s;t was much augmented by other
circum&s;tances of that nobleman's con|duct. He wrote many letters to the Queen
and council, full of peevi&s;h and impatient expre&s;&s;ions; complaining of
his enemies, lamenting that their calum|nies &s;hould be believed again&s;t
him, and di&s;covering &s;ymptoms of a mind, equally haughty and
di&s;contented. She took care to inform him of her di&s;|&s;atisfaction; but
commanded him to remain in Ireland till farther orders.</P>
<P>ESSEX heard at once of Elizabeth's anger, and of the promotion
of his ene|my, Sir Robert Cecil, to the office of ma&s;ter of the wards, an
office which he <PB N="686" REF="291"> him&s;elf a&s;pired to: And dreading,
that, if he remained any longer ab&s;ent, the Queen would be totally alienated
from him, he ha&s;tily embraced a re&s;olution, which, he knew, had once
&s;ucceeded with the earl of Leice&s;ter, the former fa|vourite of Elizabeth.
Leice&s;ter being informed, while in the Low Countries, that his mi&s;tre&s;s
was extremely di&s;plea&s;ed with his conduct, di&s;obeyed her orders by coming
over into England; and having pacified her by his pre&s;ence, by his apologies,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Returns to England.</NOTE> E&s;&s;ex,
therefore, weighing more the &s;imilarity of circum|&s;tances than the
difference of characters between him&s;elf and Leice&s;ter, immedi|ately &s;et
out for England; and making &s;peedy journeys, he arrived at court be|fore any

newly ri&s;en, and was &s;itting with her hair about her face. He threw
him&s;elf on his knees, ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and had &s;ome private conference
with her; where he was &s;o graciou&s;ly received, that on his departure he was
heard to expre&s;s great &s;atisfaction, and to thank God, that, tho' he had
&s;uffered much trouble and many &s;torms abroad, he found a &s;weet calm at
home<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p.

<P>But this placability of Elizabeth was merely the re&s;ult of her
&s;urprize, and of the momentary &s;atisfaction, which &s;he felt on the
&s;udden and unexpected ap|pearance of her favourite: After &s;he had found
leizure for recollection, all his faults recurred to her memory; and &s;he
thought it nece&s;&s;ary by &s;ome &s;evere di&s;|cipline, to &s;ubdue this
haughty and imperious &s;pirit, who, pre&s;uming on her partiality and
indulgence, had pretended to domineer in her councils, to engro&s;s all her
favour, and to act in the mo&s;t important affairs, without regard to her
orders and in&s;tructions. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is di&s;graced.</NOTE> When E&s;&s;ex waited
on her in the afternoon, he found her extremely altered in her carriage towards
him: She ordered him to be con|&s;ined to his chamber; to be twice examined by

committed him to the cu&s;tody of the lord keeper, Egerton, and held him
&s;eque&s;tered from all company, even from that of his counte&s;s, nor was
&s;o much as the intercour&s;e of letters permitted between them. E&s;&s;ex
dropped many expre&s;&s;ions of humiliation and &s;orrow, none of re&s;entment:
He pro&s;e&s;&s;ed an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Queen's will: Declared his
intention of retiring into the country, and of leading thenceforth a private
life, remote from courts and bu&s;ine&s;s: But tho' he a&s;&s;ected to be &s;o
entirely cured of his a&s;piring <PB N="687" REF="292"> ambition, the vexation
of this di&s;appointment, and of the triumph gained by his enemies, preyed upon
his haughty &s;pirit; and he &s;ell into a di&s;temper, which &s;eemed to put
his life in hazard.</P>
<P>THE Queen had always declared to all the world, and even to the
earl him&s;elf, that the purpo&s;e of her &s;everity was to correct, not to
ruin him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, p. 444, 445. Sydney Papers,

little alarm d with the danger. She ordered eight phy&s;icians of the be&s;t
reputation and experience to con&s;ult of his ca&s;e; and being informed, that
the i&s;&s;ue was much to be apprehended, &s;he &s;ent Dr. James to him with
&s;ome broth, and de&s;ired that phy&s;ician to deliver him a me&s;&s;age,
which &s;he probably deemed of &s;till greater virtue; that, if &s;he thought
&s;uch a &s;tep con|&s;i&s;tent with her honour, &s;he would her&s;elf pay him
a vi&s;it. The by &s;tanders, who carefully ob&s;erved her countenance,
remarked, that in pronouncing the&s;e words, her eyes were &s;uffu&s;ed with

<P>WHEN the&s;e &s;ymptoms of the Queen's returning affection
toward's E&s;&s;ex were known, they gave a &s;en&s;ible alarm to the faction
which had declared their oppo|&s;ition to him. Sir Walter Raleigh, in
particular, the mo&s;t violent as well as the mo&s;t ambitious of his enemies,
was &s;o affected with the appearance of that &s;ud|den revolution, that he was

entertained more promi&s;ing hopes of his future fortunes, was &s;o much

and entertaining authors which, even during the time of his greate&s;t
pro&s;perity, he had never entirely neglected.</P>
<P>THERE were &s;everal incidents which kept alive the Queen's
anger again&s;t E&s;&s;ex. Every account which &s;he received from Ireland,
convinced her more and more of his mi&s;conduct in that government, and of the
in&s;ignificant purpo&s;es to which he had employed &s;o much force and
trea&s;ure. Tyrone, &s;o far from being quelled, had thought proper, in le&s;s
than three months, to break the truce, and joining with O Donel, and other
rebels, had over-run almo&s;t the whole kingdom. He boa&s;ted, that he was
certain of receiving a &s;upply of men, money, and arms from Spain: He
pretended to be champion of the catholic religion: And he loudly exulted in the
pre&s;ent of a phaenix plume, which the pope, Clement the eighth, in order to
encourage him in the pro&s;ecution of &s;o good a cau&s;e, had con|&s;ecrated,
and had conferred upon him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.
617.</NOTE>. The Queen, that &s;he might check his progre&s;s, returned to her
former intention, of appointing Mountjoy lord-deputy; and tho' that nobleman,
who was an intimate friend of E&s;&s;ex, and de&s;ired his re|turn to the
government of Ireland, did at fir&s;t very earne&s;tly excu&s;e him&s;elf, on
account of his bad &s;tate of health, &s;he obliged him to accept of that
employment. Mountjoy found the i&s;land almo&s;t in a de&s;perate &s;ituation;
but being a man of capacity and vigour, he was &s;o little di&s;couraged, that
he immediately advanced again&s;t Tyrone in Ul&s;ter. He penetrated into the
heart of that country, the chief &s;eat of the rebels: He fortified Derry and
Mount-Norris, in order to bridle the Iri&s;h: He chaced them from the field,
and obliged them to take &s;helter in the woods and mora&s;&s;es: He employed,
with equal &s;ucce&s;s, Sir George Carew in Mun&s;ter: And by the&s;e
promi&s;ing &s;ucce&s;&s;es, he gave new life to the Queen's au|thority in that
country.</P>
<P>AS the compari&s;on of Mountjoy's admini&s;tration with that of
E&s;&s;ex, contri|buted to alienate her from her favourite, &s;he received
additional di&s;gu&s;t from the partiality of the people, who,
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an extravagant idea of E&s;&s;ex's merit, complained
of the inju&s;tice which was done him, by his removal from court, and by his
con&s;inement. Libels were &s;ecretly di&s;per&s;ed again&s;t Cecil and 
<PB N="689" REF="294"> Raleigh, and all his enemies. And his popularity, which
was always great, &s;eemed rather to be increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed by his
misfortunes. Elizabeth, in order to ju&s;tify to the public her conduct with
regard to him, had often taken the re&s;olution of having him tried in the
&s;tar-chamber, for his offences: But her tenderne&s;s for him prevailed at
la&s;t over her &s;everity; and &s;he was contented to have him only examined
by the privy-council. The attorney-general, Coke, opened the cau&s;e again&s;t
him, and treated him with the cruelty and in&s;olence which that great lawyer
u&s;ually exerci&s;ed again&s;t the unfortunate. He di&s;played, in the
&s;tronge&s;t colours, all the faults committed by E&s;&s;ex in his
admini&s;tration of Ireland: His making Southampton general of the hor&s;e,
contrary to the Queen's injunctions; his de&s;erting the enterprize again&s;t
Tyrone, and marching to Lein&s;ter and Mun&s;ter; his conferring knighthood on
too many per&s;ons; his &s;ecret conference with Tyrone; and his &s;udden
return from Ireland, in contempt of her maje&s;ty's commands. He al&s;o
exaggerated the indignity of the conditions which Tyrone had been allowed to
propo&s;e; odious and abominable conditions, &s;aid he; a public toleration of
an idolatrous religion, pardon for him&s;elf and every traitor in Ireland, and
full re&s;titution of lands and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to all of them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 449.</NOTE>. The
&s;ollicitor-general, Fleming, in&s;i&s;ted upon the wretched &s;ituation in
which the earl had left that kingdom; and Francis Bacon, &s;on to Sir Nicholas
Bacon, who had been lord keeper in the beginning of the pre&s;ent reign,
clo&s;ed the charge with di&s;playing the undutiful expre&s;&s;ions contained
in &s;ome letters wrote by the earl.</P>
<P>ESSEX, when his turn came to plead in his own behalf, renounced,
with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and humility, all preten&s;ions to an apology<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 200.</NOTE>; and
declared his re&s;o|lution never, on this or any other occa&s;ion, to have any
conte&s;t with his &s;overeign. He &s;aid, that having &s;evered him&s;elf from
the world, and abjured all &s;entiments of ambition, he had no &s;cruple to
confe&s;s every failing or error into which his youth, folly, or manifold
infirmities might have betrayed him; that his inward &s;orrow for his offences
again&s;t her maje&s;ty was &s;o profound, that it exceeded all his outward
cro&s;&s;es and afflictions, nor did he retain any &s;cruple of &s;ubmitting to
a public confe&s;&s;ion of whatever &s;he had been plea&s;ed to impute to him;
that in his acknowlegements he retained only one re&s;erve, which he never
would relinqui&s;h but with his life, the a&s;&s;ertion of a loyal and
unpolluted heart, of an unfeigned af|fection, of an earne&s;t de&s;ire ever to
perform to her maje&s;ty the be&s;t &s;ervice which his poor abilities would
permit; and that if this &s;entiment was recognized by the council, he
willingly acquie&s;ced in any condemnation or &s;entence which 
<PB N="690" REF="295"> they could pronounce again&s;t him. This
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was uttered with &s;o much eloquence, and in &s;o pathetic a
manner, that it drew tears from many of the &s;pectators<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 200, 201.</NOTE>. All the
privy-coun&s;ellors, in giving their judgment, made no &s;cru|ple of doing the
earl ju&s;tice, with regard to the loyalty of his intentions. Even Cecil, whom
he believed his capital enemy, treated him with regard and hu|manity. And the
&s;entence given by the lord keeper, (to which the council a&s;|&s;ented) was
in the&s;e words. 
<Q REND="inline">"If this cau&s;e," &s;aid he, "had been heard in
the Star-chamber, my &s;entence mu&s;t have been for as great a fine as ever

cen&s;ure is, that the earl of E&s;&s;ex is not to execute the office of a
coun&s;ellor, nor that of earl mar|&s;hal of England, nor of ma&s;ter of the
ordinance; and to return to his own hou&s;e, there to continue a pri&s;oner,

The earl of Cumberland made a &s;light oppo&s;ition to this &s;entence; and
&s;aid, that if he thought it would &s;tand, he would have required a little
longer time to deliberate, that he thought it &s;omewhat &s;e|vere, and that
any commander in chief might ea&s;ily incur a like penalty. But, however, added
he, in confidence of her maje&s;ty's mercy, I agree with the re&s;t. The earl
of Worce&s;ter delivered his opinion in a couple of Latin ver&s;es, imply|ing,
that, where the Gods are offended, even misfortunes ought to be imputed as
crimes, and that accident is no excu&s;e for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the

<P>BACON, &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed afterwards by his high
offices, and &s;till more by his profound genius for the &s;ciences, was nearly
allied to the Cecil family, being nephew to lord Burleigh, and cou&s;in-german
to the &s;ecretary: But notwith&s;tand|ing his extraordinary talents, he had
met with &s;o little protection from his power|ful relations, that he had not
yet obtained any preferment in the law, which was his profe&s;&s;ion. But
E&s;&s;ex, who could di&s;tingui&s;h merit, and who pa&s;&s;ionately loved it,
had entered into an intimate friend&s;hip with Bacon; had zealou&s;ly
at|tempted, tho' without &s;ucce&s;s, to procure him the office of Queen's
&s;ollicitor; and in order to comfort his friend under the di&s;appointment,
had conferred on him a pre&s;ent of land to the value of eighteen hundred
pounds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 78.</NOTE>. The public could
ill excu&s;e Bacon's appearance before the council, again&s;t &s;o munificent a
benefactor; tho' he acted in obedience to the Queen's orders: But &s;he was
&s;o well plea&s;ed with his behaviour, that &s;he impo&s;ed on him a new
ta&s;k, of drawing <PB N="691" REF="296"> a narrative of that day's
proceedings, in order to &s;atisfy the nation of the ju&s;tice and lenity of
her conduct. Bacon, who wanted firmne&s;s of character, more than humanity,
gave to the whole tran&s;action the mo&s;t favourable turn for E&s;&s;ex; and,
in particular, painted out, in elaborate expre&s;&s;ion, the dutiful
&s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion which that nobleman di&s;covered in the defence which he made
for his con|duct. When he read the paper to her, &s;he &s;miled at that
pa&s;&s;age, and ob&s;erved to Bacon, that old love, &s;he &s;aw, could not
ea&s;ily be forgotten. He replied, that he hoped &s;he meant that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> her&s;elf<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 83.</NOTE>.</P>

&s;eemed determined to per|&s;evere in that conduct which had hitherto been
&s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, and which the Queen, by all this di&s;cipline, had
endeavoured to render habitual to him: He wrote to her, that he ki&s;&s;ed her

could never recover his u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s, till &s;he deigned to admit him
to that pre&s;ence which had ever been the chief &s;ource of his happine&s;s
and enjoyment: And that he had now re&s;olved to make amends for his pa&s;t

<P>THE earl of E&s;&s;ex po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a monopoly of &s;weet

that it was the only proper method of managing her<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 79.</NOTE>: But being now reduced to de|&s;pair, he
gave entire reins to his violent di&s;po&s;ition, and threw off all appear|ance

to increa&s;e the general good-will by an ho&s;pitable manner of life, little

given him great connections with gentlemen of the military profe&s;&s;ion; and
he now entertained; by additional care&s;&s;es and civilities, a friend&s;hip
with all de&s;perate adventurers&punc; who&s;e attachment, he hoped, might, in

openly care&s;&s;ed, and who&s;e manners he &s;eemed to have entirely adopted.
He engaged the mo&s;t celebrated preachers of that &s;ect to re&s;ort to

to the King of Scots, her heir and &s;ucce&s;&s;or. That prince had this year
very narrowly e&s;caped a dangerous, tho' ill formed, con&s;piracy of the earl

increa&s;ed of mounting that throne, on which, be&s;ides acquiring a great

who had acquired a great a&s;cendant over his patron. A &s;elect council of

<P>WHILE the&s;e de&s;perate projects were in agitation, many
rea&s;ons of &s;u&s;picion were carried to the Queen; and &s;he &s;ent Robert
Sacville, the trea&s;urer's &s;on, to E&s;&s;ex-hou&s;e, under pretence of a
vi&s;it, but, in reality, with a view of di&s;covering whether there was in
that place any concour&s;e of people, or any extraordinary pre|parations, which
might threaten an in&s;urrection. Soon after, E&s;&s;ex received a &s;um|mons
to attend the council, which met at the trea&s;urer's hou&s;e; and while he was
mu&s;ing on this circum&s;tance, and comparing it with the late unexpected
vi&s;it from Sacville, a private note was conveyed to him, by which he was
warned to pro|vide for his own &s;afety. He concluded, that all his
con&s;piracy was di&s;covered, or at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected, and that the
ea&s;ie&s;t puni&s;hment which he could expect, was a new and more &s;evere
con&s;inement: He therefore excu&s;ed him&s;elf to the council on pretence of
an indi&s;po&s;ition; and he immediately di&s;patched me&s;&s;ages to his more
intimate confederates, reque&s;ting their advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the
pre&s;ent cri|tical <PB N="697" REF="302"> &s;ituation of his affairs. They
deliberated, whether they &s;hould abandon all their projects, and fly the
kingdom; or in&s;tantly &s;eize the palace with the force which they could
a&s;&s;emble; or rely upon the affections of the citizens, who were generally
known to bear a great affection to the earl. E&s;&s;ex declared again&s;t the
fir&s;t expedient, and profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf determined to undergo any fate
rather than &s;ubmit to live the life of a fugitive. To &s;eize the palace
&s;eemed impracticable without more preparation; e&s;pecially as the Queen
&s;eemed now aware of their projects, and, as they heard, had u&s;ed the
precaution of doubling her ordinary guards. There remained, therefore, no other
expedient but that of betaking them&s;elves to the city; and while the prudence
and expediency of this re&s;olution was under debate, a per&s;on arrived, who,
as if he had received a commi&s;&s;ion for that purpo&s;e, gave them
a&s;&s;urance of the good affection of the Londoners, and affirmed, that they
might &s;ecurely re&s;t any project on that foundation. The po|pularity of
E&s;&s;ex had chiefly buoyed him up in all his vain undertakings; and he fondly
imagined, that with no other a&s;&s;i&s;tance than the good will of the
multi|tude, he might be enabled to overturn Elizabeth's government, confirmed
by time, revered for wi&s;dom, &s;upported by vigour, and concurring with the
gene|ral &s;entiments of the nation. The wild project of rai&s;ing the city was
immedi|ately re&s;olved on; the execution of it was delayed till next day; and
emi&s;&s;aries were di&s;patched to all E&s;&s;ex's friends, informing them
that Cobham and Raleigh had laid &s;chemes again&s;t his life, and entreating
their pre&s;ence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8th February.</NOTE> NEXT day, there appeared
at E&s;&s;ex-hou&s;e the earls of Southampton and Rut|land, the lords Sandys
and Monteagle, with about three hundred gentlemen of good quality and fortune;
and E&s;&s;ex informed them of the danger, to which, he pretended, the
machinations of his enemies expo&s;ed him. To &s;ome, he &s;aid, that he would
throw him&s;elf at the Queen's feet, and crave her ju&s;tice and pro|tection:
To others, he boa&s;ted of his intere&s;t in the city, and affirmed, that,
whatever might happen, this re&s;ource could never fail him. The Queen was
in|formed of the&s;e de&s;igns, by means of intelligence, conveyed, as is
&s;uppo&s;ed, to Raleigh by Sir Ferdinando Gorges; and having ordered the
magi&s;trates of Lon|don to keep the citizens in readine&s;s, &s;he &s;ent

all their &s;ervants were excluded, except the pur&s;e-bearer. After &s;ome
alternation, in which they charged E&s;&s;ex's retainers, upon their
allegiance, to lay down their army, and were in traced in their turn by the
angry multitude, who &s;urrounded them, the earl&punc; who found, that matters

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> them pri&s;oners 
<PB N="698" REF="303"> in his hou&s;e, and to proceed to the execution of his
former project. He i&s;&s;ued out with about two hundred attendants, armed only
with &s;words; and in his pa&s;&s;age to the city was joined by the earl of
Bedford and lord Cromwel. He cried aloud, <HI>For the Queen! for the Queen! a
plot is laid for my life;</HI> and then pro|ceeded to the hou&s;e of Smith, the
&s;heriff, on who&s;e aid he had great reliance. The citizens flocked about him
in amazement; but tho' he told them, that Eng|land was &s;old to the infanta,
and exhorted them to arm in&s;tantly, otherwi&s;e they could not do him any
&s;ervice, no one &s;howed a di&s;po&s;ition to join him. The &s;heriff, on the
earl's approach to his hou&s;e, &s;tole out at the back door, and made the
be&s;t of his way to the lord mayor. E&s;&s;ex, meanwhile, ob&s;erving the
coldne&s;s of the citizens, and hearing, that he was proclaimed a traitor by
the earl of Cumberland and lord Burleigh, began to de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s,
and thought of retreating to his own hou&s;e. He found the &s;treets in his
pa&s;&s;age barricadoed, and guarded by the citizens, under the command of Sir
John Levi&s;on. In his attempt to force his way, Tracy, a young gentleman, to
whom he bore great friend&s;hip, was killed, with two or three of the
Londoners; and the earl him|&s;elf, attended by a few of his partizans (for the
greate&s;t part began &s;ecretly to withdraw them&s;elves) retired towards the
river, and taking boat, arrived at E&s;&s;ex-hou&s;e. He there found, that
Gorges, whom he had &s;ent before to capitulate with the lord keeper and the
other coun&s;ellors, had given them all their li|berty, and had gone to court
with them. He was now reduced to de&s;pair; and appeared determined, in
pro&s;ecution of lord Sandys's advice, to defend him&s;elf to the la&s;t
extremity, and rather to peri&s;h, like a brave man, with his &s;word in his
hand, than ba&s;ely by the hands of the executioner: But after &s;ome parley,
and after demanding in vain, fir&s;t ho&s;tages, then conditions, from the
be&s;iegers, he &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion; reque&s;ting only civil
treatment, and a fair and im|partial hearing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p

<P>THE Queen, who, during all this commotion, had behaved with as
great tran|quillity and &s;ecurity, as if there had only pa&s;&s;ed a fray in
the &s;treets, in which &s;he was no way concerned<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 469.</NOTE>, &s;oon gave orders for

every body, the trea&s;onable conferences at Drury-hou&s;e were proved by
undoubted evidence. Sir Ferdinando Gorges was produced in court&punc; The

Monteagle, of Davers, Blount, and Davies, were only read to the peers,

be&s;t friends were &s;candalized at his a&s;&s;urance in in&s;i&s;ting &s;o
po&s;itively on his innocence, and the goodne&s;s of his in|tentions; and
&s;till more at his vindictive di&s;po&s;ition, in accu&s;ing, without any
appearance of rea&s;on, &s;ecretary Cecil as a partizan of the infanta's title.
The &s;ecre|tary, who had expected this charge, &s;tepped into the court, and
challenged E&s;&s;ex to produce his authority, which, on examination, was found
extremely weak and frivolous<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. IV. p.
530.</NOTE>. When &s;entence was pronounced, E&s;&s;ex &s;poke like a man who
laid his account to die: But he added, that he &s;hould be &s;orry, if he was
repre&s;ented to the Queen as a per&s;on that de&s;pi&s;ed her clemency; tho'
he &s;hould not, he believed, make any cringing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to obtain it.
Southampton's behaviour was more mild and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive: He entreated the
good offices of the peers in &s;o mode&s;t and becoming a manner, as excited
compa&s;&s;ion in every one.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tance in E&s;&s;ex's trial was
Bacon's appearance again&s;t him. He was none of the crown lawyers; &s;o was
not obliged by his office to a&s;&s;i&s;t at this trial: Yet did he not
&s;cruple, in order to obtain the Queen's favour, to be active in bereaving of
life his friend and patron, who&s;e genero&s;ity he had often experienced. He
compared E&s;&s;ex's conduct, in pretending to fear the attempts of his
adver&s;aries, to that of Pi&s;i&s;tratus, the Athenian, who cut and wounded
his own body; and making the people believe, that his enemies had committed
that violence, obtained a guard for his per&s;on, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance
he afterwards &s;ubdued the liberties of his country.</P>
<P>AFTER E&s;&s;ex had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome days in the folitude and
reflection of a pri&s;on, his proud heart was at la&s;t &s;ubdued, not by the
fear of death, but by the &s;enti|ments of religion; a principle, which he had
before attempted to make the in|&s;trument of his ambition, but which now took
a more firm hold of his mind, and prevailed over every other motive and
con&s;ideration. His &s;piritual directors per&s;uaded him, that he never could
obtain the pardon of heaven, unle&s;s he made a full confe&s;&s;ion of his
di&s;loyalty; and he gave in to the council an account of all his mo&s;t
criminal de&s;igns, as well as of his corre&s;pondence with the King of Scots.
He &s;pared not even his mo&s;t intimate friends, &s;uch as lord Mountjoy, whom
he had engaged in the&s;e con&s;piracies; and he

particular, a man of merit, he accu&s;ed of a corre&s;pondence with the
con&s;pirators; tho' it appears, that that gentleman had never a&s;&s;ented to

than in not revealing the earl's trea&s;on; an office, to which every man of
honour naturally bears the &s;tronge&s;t reluctance<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">2.</NOTE>. Neville was thrown into pri&s;on, and underwent a

&s;ucce&s;sful commander, &s;he continued him in his government, and
&s;acrificed her re&s;entment to the public &s;ervice.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH affected extremely the prai&s;e of clemency; and in
every great example, which &s;he had made during her reign, &s;he had always
appeared full of reluctance and he&s;itation: But the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of
E&s;&s;ex called forth all her tender affections, and kept her in the mo&s;t
real agitation and irre&s;olution. She felt a perpetual combat between
re&s;entment and inclination, pride and compa&s;&s;ion, the care of her own
&s;afety and concern for her favourite; and her &s;ituation, dur|ing this
interval, was perhaps more an object of pity, than that to which E&s;&s;ex
him&s;elf was reduced. She &s;igned the warrant for his execution; &s;he
counter|manded it; &s;he again re&s;olved on his death; &s;he felt a new return
of tenderne&s;s: E&s;&s;ex's enemies told her, that he him&s;elf de&s;ired to
die, and had a&s;&s;ured her, that &s;he could never be in &s;afety while he
lived: It is likely, that this proof of penitence and of concern for her, would
operate a contrary effect to what they intended, and would revive all that fond
affection, which &s;he had &s;o long indulged to the unhappy pri&s;oner. But
what chiefly hardened her heart again&s;t him was his &s;up|po&s;ed
ob&s;tinacy, in never making, as &s;he hourly expected, any application to her
for mercy and forgivene&s;s; and &s;he finally gave her con&s;ent to his
execution. He di&s;covered at his death &s;ymptoms rather of penitence and
piety than of fear; and willingly acknowleged the ju&s;tice of the &s;entence,
by which he &s;uffered. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th February</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And execution</NOTE> The execution was private

Bacon, vol. IV&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">34.</NOTE>. And the Queen, no
doubt, thought, that prudence required the removal of &s;o melancholy a
&s;pectacle from the public eye. Sir Walter Raleigh, who came to the Tower on
purpo&s;e, and who beheld E&s;&s;ex's execution from a window, encrea&s;ed much
by this action the general hatred, under which he already laboured: It was
thought, that he had no other purpo&s;e than to fea&s;t his eyes with the death
of his enemy; and no apology, which he could make for &s;o exceptionable a
cir|cum&s;tance of conduct, could be accepted by the public. The cruelty and
ani|mo&s;ity, <PB N="701" REF="306"> with which he urged on E&s;&s;ex's fate,
even when Cecil relented<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Murdin, p 811.</NOTE>,
were &s;till regarded as the principles of this unmanly and ungenerous
behaviour.</P>
<P>THE earl of E&s;&s;ex was but thirty-four years of age, when his
ra&s;hne&s;s, impru|dence, and violence brought him to this untimely end. We
mu&s;t here, as in many other in&s;tances, lament the incon&s;tancy of human
nature, that a per&s;on en|dowed with &s;o many noble virtues, genero&s;ity,
&s;incerity, friend&s;hip, valour, elo|quence, and indu&s;try, &s;hould in the
latter period of his life have given &s;uch reins to his ungovernable
pa&s;&s;ions, as involved, not only him&s;elf, but many of his friends, in
utter ruin. The Queen's tenderne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion, as it was the cau&s;e of
tho&s;e premature honours, which he attained, &s;eems, on the whole, the chief
circum&s;tance which brought on his de&s;truction. Confident of her partiality
to|wards him; as well as of his own merit, he treated her with a haughtine&s;s,
which neither her love nor her dignity could bear; and as her amorous
inclinations in &s;o advanced an age, would naturally make her appear
ridiculous, if not hateful in his eyes, he was engaged, by an imprudent
openne&s;s, of which he made pro|fe&s;&s;ion, to di&s;cover too ea&s;ily
tho&s;e &s;entiments to her jealous pride. The many reconciliations and returns
of affection, of which he had &s;till made advantage, made him venture on new
provocations, till he pu&s;hed her beyond all bounds of patience; and he
forgot, that, tho' the &s;entiments of the woman were ever &s;trong in her,
tho&s;e of the &s;overeign had &s;till in the end appeared predomi|nant.</P>
<P>SOME of E&s;&s;ex's a&s;&s;ociates, Cuffe, Davers, Blount,
Meric, and Davis were tried and condemned, and all of them, except Davis, were
executed. The Queen pardoned the re&s;t; being per&s;uaded that they were drawn
in merely from their friend&s;hip to that nobleman, and their care of his
&s;afety; and were igno|rant of the more criminal part of his intentions.
Southampton's life was &s;pared with great difficulty; but he was kept in
pri&s;on during all the remainder of this reign.</P>
<P>THE King of Scots, who was apprehen&s;ive left his
corre&s;pondence with E&s;&s;ex might have been di&s;covered, and have given
offence to Elizabeth, &s;ent the earl of Mar and the lord Kinlo&s;s as
amba&s;&s;adors to England, in order to con|gratulate the Queen on her e&s;cape
from the late in&s;urrection and con&s;piracy. They were al&s;o ordered to
enquire whether any mea&s;ures had been taken by her to exclude him from the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as well as to di&s;cover the inclinations of the chief
nobility and coun&s;ellors, in ca&s;e of the Queen's demi&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Memoirs, vol.

as they could wi&s;h; and they even entered into <PB N="702" REF="307"> a
corre&s;pondence with &s;ecretary Cecil, who&s;e influence, after the fall of

confidence of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or. He knew how jealous Elizabeth ever was of
her authority, and he therefore carefully concealed from her his attachment to
James: But he afterwards a&s;&s;erted, that nothing could be more advantageous
to her, than this corre&s;pondence; becau&s;e the King of Scots, &s;ecure of
mounting the throne by his undoubted title, aided by tho&s;e connexions with
the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, was the le&s;s likely to give any di&s;turbance to
the pre&s;ent &s;overeign. He al&s;o per&s;uaded that prince to remain in
quiet, and patiently to expect, that time &s;hould open to him the inheritance
of the throne, without pu&s;hing his friends on de&s;perate enterprizes, which
would totally incapacitate them from &s;erving him. James's equity, as well as
his natural want of enterprize, ea&s;ily inclined him to embrace this
re&s;olution<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 471, 472.</NOTE>;
and thus the minds of the Engli&s;h were &s;ilently, but univer&s;ally
di&s;po&s;ed to admit, without oppo&s;ition, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the
Scotti&s;h line: The death of E&s;&s;ex, by putting an end to faction, had been
rather fa|vourable than prejudicial to that great event.</P>
<P>THE King of France, who was little prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in
favour of James, and who was aver&s;e to the union of England and Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 352.</NOTE>, made his amba&s;&s;ador
drop &s;ome hints to Cecil of Henry's willingne&s;s to concur in any mea&s;ure
for di&s;appointing the hopes of the Scotch monarch; but as Cecil &s;howed an
entire di&s;approbation of &s;uch &s;chemes, the court of France took no
farther &s;teps in that matter: and thus the only foreign power, which could
give much di&s;turbance to James's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, was induced to acquie&s;ce
in it<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 471.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">French affairs.</NOTE> Henry made a journey
this &s;ummer to Calais; and the Queen, hearing of his intentions, went to
Dover, in hopes of having a per&s;onal interview with a monarch, whom, of all
others, &s;he mo&s;t loved and mo&s;t re&s;pected. The French King, who felt
the &s;ame &s;enti|ments towards her, would gladly have accepted of the
propo&s;al; but as many difficulties occurred, it appeared nece&s;&s;ary to lay
a&s;ide, by common con&s;ent, the project of an interview. Elizabeth, however,
wrote &s;ucce&s;&s;ively two let|ters to Henry, one by Edmondes, another by Sir
Robert Sydney, in which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of conferring about a
bu&s;ine&s;s of importance, with &s;ome mi|ni&s;ter in whom that prince
repo&s;ed entire confidence. The marque&s;s of Rhoni, the King's favourite and
prime mini&s;ter, came to Dover in di&s;gui&s;e; and the memoirs of that able
&s;tate&s;man contain a full account of his conver&s;ation with Elizabeth. That
magnanimous prince&s;s had formed a &s;cheme of e&s;tabli&s;hing, in
conjunction with Henry, a new &s;y&s;tem of policy in Europe, and of fixing a 
<PB N="703" REF="308"> durable ballance of power, by the erection of new
&s;tates on the ruins of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. She had even the wi&s;dom to
fore&s;ee the perils, which might en&s;ue from the aggrandizement of her ally;
and &s;he propo&s;ed to unite the whole &s;eventeen provinces of the Low
Countries into one republic, in order to form a perpetual barrier again&s;t the
dangerous encrea&s;e of the French, as well as of the Spani&s;h, monarchy.
Henry had him&s;elf long meditated &s;uch a project again&s;t the Au&s;trian
family; and Rhoni could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing his a&s;toni&s;hment, when
he found that Elizabeth and his ma&s;ter, tho' they had never communicated
their thoughts on this &s;ubject, had not only entered into the &s;ame general
views, but had al&s;o formed the &s;ame project for their execution. The
affairs, however, of France were not yet brought to a &s;ituation, which might
enable Henry to begin that great enterprize; and Rhoni &s;atisfied the Queen,
that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to po&s;tpone for &s;ome years their united
attack on the Au&s;trian family. He de|parted, filled with ju&s;t admiration of
the &s;olidity of Elizabeth's judgment, and the greatne&s;s of her mind; and he
owns that &s;he was entirely worthy of that high reputation, which &s;he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Europe.</P>
<P>THE Queen's magnanimity in forming &s;uch exten&s;ive projects
was the more re|markable, that, be&s;ides her having fallen &s;o far into the
decline of life, the af|fairs of Ireland, tho' conducted with ability and
&s;ucce&s;s, were &s;till in di&s;order, and made a great diver&s;ion of her
forces. The expence incurred by this war lay heavy upon her narrow revenues;
and her mini&s;ters, taking advantage of her great di&s;po&s;ition to
frugality, propo&s;ed to her an expedient of &s;aving, which, tho' &s;he at
fir&s;t di&s;approved of it, &s;he was at la&s;t induced to embrace. It was
repre&s;ented to her, that the great &s;ums of money remitted to Ireland for
the pay of the Eng|li&s;h forces, came, by the nece&s;&s;ary cour&s;e of
circulation, into the hands of the re|bels, and enabled them to buy abroad all
requi&s;ite &s;upplies of arms and ammunition, which, from the extreme poverty
of that kingdom and its want of every u&s;eful commodity, they could not
otherwi&s;e find means to purcha&s;e. It was therefore propo&s;ed to her, that
&s;he &s;hould pay her forces in money of a ba&s;e alloy; and it was
a&s;&s;erted, that, be&s;ides the great &s;aving to the revenue, this &s;pecies
of coin could never be exported with advantage, and would not pa&s;s in any
foreign market. Some of the wi&s;er coun&s;ellors maintained, that, if the pay
of the &s;ol|diers was rai&s;ed in proportion, the Iri&s;h rebels would
nece&s;&s;arily reap the &s;ame benefit from the ba&s;e money, which would
always be taken at a rate &s;uitable to its value; if the pay was not rai&s;ed,
there was danger of a mutiny among the troops, who, whatever names might be
affixed to the pieces of metal, would &s;oon find from experience that they
were defrauded in their income<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p.

MOUNTJOY, the deputy, was a man of great ability; and fore&s;eeing the dan|ger
of mutiny among the troops, he led them in&s;tantly into the field, and
re|&s;olved, by means of &s;trict di&s;cipline, and by keeping them employed
again&s;t the enemy, to obviate tho&s;e inconveniencies, which were ju&s;tly
apprehended. He made military roads, and built a fortre&s;s at Moghery; he
drove the Mac-Geni&s;es out of Lecale; he harra&s;&s;ed Tyrone in Ul&s;ter with
inroads and le&s;&s;er expeditions; and by de&s;troying, every where, and
during all &s;ea&s;ons, the provi&s;ions of the Iri&s;h, he reduced them to
peri&s;h with famine in the woods and mora&s;&s;es, to which they were obliged
to retreat. At the &s;ame time, Sir Henry Docwray, who com|manded another body
of troops, took the ca&s;tle of Derry, and put garri&s;ons into Newton and
Ainogh; and having &s;eized the mona&s;tery of Donnegal near Bali&s;han|non, he
threw troops into it, and defended it again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of O'Donnel
and the Iri&s;h. Nor was Sir George Carew idle in the province of Mun&s;ter. He
&s;eized the titular earl of De&s;mond, and &s;ent him over, with Florence
Macarty, another chieftain, pri&s;oner to England. He arre&s;ted many
&s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, and took ho&s;tages from others. And having got a
reinforcement of two thou&s;and men from England, he threw him&s;elf into
Corke, which he &s;upplied with arms and provi&s;ions; and he put every thing
in a condition for re&s;i&s;ting the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion, which was daily
expected. The deputy, informed of the danger, to which the &s;outhern provinces
were expo&s;ed, left the pro&s;ecution of the war again&s;t Tyrone, who was
reduced to great extremity; and he marched with his army into Mon&s;ter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">23d Septem|ber.</NOTE> AT la&s;t, the
Spaniards, under Don John d'Aquila, arrived at King&s;ale; and Sir Richard
Piercy, who commanded in the town with a &s;mall garri&s;on of an hundred and
fifty men, &s;ound him&s;elf obliged to abandon it on their appearance. The&s;e
in|vaders amounted to four thou&s;and men, and the Iri&s;h expre&s;&s;ed a
great de&s;ire to join them, in order to free them&s;elves from the Engli&s;h
government, with which they were extremely di&s;contented. One chief ground of
their complaint was the in|troduction of trials by jury<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 644.</NOTE>; an in&s;titution, abhorred by
this barbarous nation, tho' nothing contributes more to the &s;upport of that
equity and liberty, for which the Engli&s;h laws are &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated.
The Iri&s;h al&s;o bore a great fa|vour <PB N="705" REF="310"> to the
Spaniards, having entertained the opinion, that they them&s;elves were
de&s;cended from that nation; and their attachment to the catholic religion
proved a new cau&s;e of affection to the invaders. D'Aquila a&s;&s;umed the
title of general in the holy war for the pre&s;ervation of the faith in
Ireland; and he endeavoured to per&s;uade the people, that Queen Elizabeth was,
by &s;everal bulls of the pope, deprived of her crown; that her &s;ubjects were
ab&s;olved from their oaths of alle|giance; and that the Spaniards were come to

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeat of the Spaniards and Iri&s;h.</NOTE>
Mountjoy found it nece&s;&s;ary to act with vigour, in order to prevent a total
in&s;urrection of the Iri&s;h; and having gathered together his forces, he
formed the &s;iege of Kin&s;ale by land; while Sir Richard Levi&s;on, with a
&s;mall &s;quadron, blockaded it by &s;ea. He had no &s;ooner begun his
operations than he heard of the arrival of another body of two thou&s;and
Spaniards, under the command of Alphon&s;o Ocampo, who had taken
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Baltimore and Bere-haven; and he found him&s;elf obliged
to detach Sir George Carew to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s. Tyrone, meanwhile,
with Randal, Mac Surley, Tirel baron of Killey, and other chieftains of the
Iri&s;h, had joined Ocampo with all their forces, and were marching to the
relief of Kin&s;ale. The deputy, informed of their de&s;ign by intercepted
letters, made preparations to receive them; and being joined by Levi&s;on with
&s;ix hundred marines, he po&s;ted his troops on an advantageous ground, which
lay on their pa&s;&s;age, leaving &s;ome cavalry to prevent a &s;ally from
D'Aquila and the Spani&s;h garri&s;on. When Tyrone, with a body of Iri&s;h and
Spaniards, approached, he was &s;urprized to find the Engli&s;h &s;o well
po&s;ted, and ranged in &s;uch good order; and he immediately &s;ounded a
retreat: But the deputy gave orders to pur|&s;ue him; and having thrown the&s;e
advanced troops into di&s;order, he followed them to the main body, whom he
al&s;o attacked, and put to flight, with the &s;laughter of twelve hundred
men<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol I p 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. Ocampo was taken pri&s;oner; Tyrone fled into

reduced to the greate&s;t difficulties, was obliged to capitulate upon &s;uch
terms as the deputy pre&s;cribed to him: He &s;urrendered Kin&s;ale and
Baltimore, and agreed to evacuate the Kingdom. This great blow, joined to other
&s;ucce&s;&s;es, gained by Wilmot, governor of Kerry, and by Roger and Gavin

reduction of that kingdom.</P>

&s;till remained as high and uncontroulable as ever.</P>
<P>THE active reign of Elizabeth had enabled many per&s;ons to
di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves in civil and military employments; and the Queen,
who was not able, from her revenue, to give them any rewards proportioned to
their &s;ervice, had made u&s;e of an expedient, which had been employed by her
predece&s;&s;ors, but which had never been carried to &s;uch an extreme as
under her admini&s;tration. She granted her &s;ervants and courtiers patents
for monopolies; and the&s;e patents they &s;old to others, who were thereby
enabled to rai&s;e commodities to what price they plea&s;ed, and who put
invincible re&s;traints upon all commerce, indu&s;try, and emulation. It is
a&s;toni&s;hing to con&s;ider the number and importance of tho&s;e commodities,
which were thus a&s;&s;igned over to patentees. Currants, &s;alt, iron, powder,
cards, calf-&s;kins, fells, pouldavies, ox-&s;hin-bones, train oil, li&s;ts of
cloth, pot-a&s;hes, anni&s;eeds, vinegar, &s;ea-coals, &s;teel, aquavitae,
bru&s;hes, pots, bottles, &s;alt-petre, lead, accidences, oil,
calamint-&s;tone, oil of blubber, gla&s;&s;es, paper, &s;tarch, tin, &s;ulphur,
new drapery, dried pilchers, tran&s;portation of iron ordnance, of beer, of
horn, of leather, importation of Spani&s;h wools, of iri&s;h yarn: The&s;e are
but a part of the commodities, which had been con&s;igned over to
monopoli&s;ts<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 648, 650, 652.</NOTE>.
When this li&s;t was read over in the hou&s;e, a member cried out, <HI>Is not
bread in the number? Bread,</HI> &s;aid every one with a&s;toni&s;hment:
<HI>Yes, I a&s;&s;ure you,</HI> replied he, <HI>if affairs go on at this rate,
we &s;hall have bread reduced to a monopoly before next Parliament</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 648.</NOTE>. The&s;e monopoli&s;ts were &s;o
exorbitant in their demands, that in &s;ome places they rai&s;ed the price of
&s;alt, from &s;ixteen pence a bu&s;hel, to fourteen or fifteen
&s;hillings<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 647.</NOTE>. Such high
profits naturally begot in|truders upon their commerce; and in order to
&s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t encroach|ments, the patentees were armed with
high and arbitrary powers from the council, by which they were enabled to
oppre&s;s the people at plea&s;ure, and to exact money from &s;uch as they
thought proper to accu&s;e of interfering with their patent<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 641, 646, 652.</NOTE>. The patentees of &s;alt-petre,
having the power of entering into every <PB N="707" REF="312"> hou&s;e, and of
committing what havock they plea&s;ed in &s;tables, cellars, or where|ever they
&s;u&s;pected &s;alt-petre might be gathered; commonly extorted money from
tho&s;e who de&s;ired to free them&s;elves of this damage or trouble<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 653.</NOTE>. And while all dome&s;tic intercour&s;e was
thus re&s;trained, le&s;t any &s;cope &s;hould remain for indu&s;try, almo&s;t
every &s;pecies of foreign commerce was confined to exclu&s;ive companies, who
bought and &s;old at any price, that they them&s;elves thought pro|per to offer
or exact.</P>
<P>THESE grievances, the mo&s;t intolerable for the pre&s;ent, and
the mo&s;t perni|cious in their con&s;equences, that ever were known in any age
or under any go|vernment, had been mentioned in the la&s;t Parliament, and a
petition had even been pre&s;ented to the Queen, complaining of the patents;
but &s;he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in defending her monopoli&s;ts again&s;t her
people. A bill was now introduced into the lower hou&s;e, aboli&s;hing all
the&s;e monopolies; and as the former application had been un&s;ucce&s;sful, a
law was in&s;i&s;ted on as the only certain expedient for correct|ing the&s;e
abu&s;es: The courtiers, on the other hand, maintained, that this mat|ter
regarded the prerogative, and that they could never hope for &s;ucce&s;s, if
they did not make application, in the mo&s;t humble and re&s;pectful manner, to
the Queen's goodne&s;s and beneficence. The topics, which were advanced in the

and were admitted by both, will appear the mo&s;t extraordinary to &s;uch as
are prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an idea of the antient privileges of the people,
and of the liberty enjoyed under the admini&s;tration of Elizabeth. It was

the&s;e &s;peeches; which may &s;erve very much to give us a ju&s;t idea of the
antient con&s;titution, and of the political principles, which prevailed during
the reign of Elizabeth. Mr. Laurence Hyde propo&s;ed a bill, entitled an act
for the explanation of the common law in certain ca&s;es of letters patent. Mr.
Spicer &s;aid, This bill may touch the prerogative-royal, which, as I learned
the la&s;t Parliament, is &s;o tran&s;cendant, that the &mdash; of the
&s;ubject may not a&s;pire thereunto. Far be it therefore from me, that the
&s;tate and prerogative-royal of the prince &s;hould be tied by me or by the
act of any other &s;ubject. Mr. Francis Bacon &s;aid, As to the
preroga|tive-royal of the prince, for my own part, I ever allowed of it; and it
is &s;uch as I hope will never be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The Queen, as &s;he is our
&s;overeign, hath both an enlarging and re&s;training power. For by her
prerogative &s;he may &s;et at liberty things re&s;trained by &s;tatute law or
otherwi&s;e, and &s;econdly by her prerogative &s;he may re&s;train things
which be at liberty. For the fir&s;t, &s;he may grant a <HI>non ob&s;tante</HI>
contrary to the penal laws.&mdash;With regard to monopolies and &s;uch like
ca&s;es, the ca&s;e hath ever been to humble our&s;elves unto her maje&s;ty,
and by petition de&s;ire to have our grievances remedied, e&s;pe|cially when
the remedy toucheth her &s;o nigh in point of prerogative.&mdash;I &s;ay, and I
&s;ay it again, that we ought not to deal, to judge or meddle with her
maje&s;ty's prerogative. I wi&s;h therefore every man to be careful of this
bu&s;ine&s;s. Dr. Bennet &s;aid, He that goeth about to debate her maje&s;ty's
prerogative had need to walk warily. Mr. Laurence Hyde &s;aid, For the bill
it&s;elf, I made it, and I think I un|der&s;tand it: And far be it from this
heart of mine to think, this tongue to &s;peak, or this hand to write any thing
either in prejudice or derogation of her maje&s;ty's prerogative-royal and the
&s;tate.&mdash;Mr. Speaker, quoth &s;erjeant Harris, for ought I &s;ee, the
hou&s;e moveth to have this bill in the nature of a petition. It mu&s;t then
begin with more humiliation. And truly, Sir, the bill is good of it&s;elf, but
the penning of it is &s;omewhat out of cour&s;e. Mr. Montague &s;aid, The
matter is good and hone&s;t, and I like this manner of proceeding by bill well
enough in this matter. The grievances are great, and I would note only unto you
thus much, that the la&s;t Parliament we proceeded by way of petition, which
had no &s;ucce&s;sful effect. Mr. Francis More &s;aid, I know the Queen's
prerogative is a thing curious to be dealt withal; yet all grievances are not
comparable. I cannot utter with my tongue or conceive with my heart the great
grievances that the town and country, for which I &s;erve, &s;uffereth by
&s;ome of the&s;e monopolies. It bringeth the general profit into a private
hand, and the end of all this is beggary and bondage to the &s;ubjects. We have
a law for the true and faithful currying of leather: There is a patent &s;ets
all at liberty, notwith&s;tanding that &s;tatute. And to what purpo&s;e is it
to do any thing by act of Parliament, when the Queen will undo the &s;ame by
her prerogative? Out of the &s;pirit of hu|miliation, Mr. Speaker, I do &s;peak
it, there is no act of her's that hath been or is more derogatory to her own
maje&s;ty, more odious to the &s;ubject, more dangerous to the commonwealth
than the grant|ing of the&s;e monopolies. Mr. Martin &s;aid, I do &s;peak for a

the knees in mire and dirt, we have laboured for, &s;hall be taken by warrant
of &s;upreme authority, which the poor &s;ubject dare not gain&s;ay? Mr. George
Moore &s;aid, We know the power of her maje&s;ty cannot be re&s;trained by any
act; why therefore &s;hould we thus talk? Admit we &s;hould make this &s;tatute
with a <HI>non ob&s;tante;</HI> yet the Queen may grant a patent with a <HI>non
ob&s;tante,</HI> to cro&s;s this <HI>non ob&s;tante.</HI> I think therefore it
agreeth more with the gravity and wi&s;dom of this hou&s;e to proceed with all
humblene&s;s by petition than bill. Mr. Downland &s;aid, As I would be no let
or over-vehement in any thing, &s;o I am not &s;otti&s;h or &s;en&s;ele&s;s of
the common grievance of the commonwealth. If we proceed by way of petition, we
can have no more gracious an&s;wer, than we had the la&s;t Parliament to our
petition. But &s;ince that Parliament, we have no reformation. Sir Robert Wroth
&s;aid, I &s;peak, and I &s;peak it boldly, the&s;e patentees are wor&s;e than
ever they were. Mr. Hayward Town&s;end propo&s;ed, that they &s;hould make
&s;uit to her maje&s;ty, not only to repeal all monopolies grievous to the
&s;ubject, but al&s;o that it would plea&s;e her maje&s;ty to give the
Parliament leave to make an act, that they might be of no more force, validity,
or effect, than they are at the common law, without the &s;trength of her
prerogative. Which tho' we might now do, and the act being &s;o rea&s;onable,
we might a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves her maje&s;ty would not delay the pa&s;&s;ing
thereof, yet we, her loving &s;ubjects, &amp;c. would not offer without her
privity and con&s;ent (the cau&s;e &s;o nearly touching her prerogative) or go
about to do any &s;uch act.</P> 
<P>On a &s;ub&s;equent day, the bill again&s;t monopolies was
again introduced, and Mr. Spicer &s;aid, It is to no purpo&s;e to offer to tie
her maje&s;ty's hands by act of parliament, when &s;he may loo&s;en her&s;elf
at her plea&s;ure. Mr. Davies &s;aid, God hath given that power to ab&s;olute
princes, which he attributes to him&s;elf. <HI>Dixi quod Dii e&s;tis.</HI> (N.
B. This axiom he applies to the Kings of England.) Mr. &s;ecre|tary Cecil
&s;aid, I am &s;ervant to the Queen, and before I would &s;peak and give
con&s;ent to a ca&s;e that &s;hould deba&s;e her prerogative, or abridge it, I

this point; but I never meant (and I hope the hou&s;e thinketh &s;o) to &s;et

been moved extravagantly in the hou&s;e, which doubtle&s;s have been told her
maje&s;ty, and perhaps ill conceived of by her, Mr. Speaker would apologize,
and humbly crave pardon for the &s;ame. N. B. The&s;e extracts were taken by
Town&s;end, a member of the hou&s;e, who was no courtier; and the extravagance
of the &s;peeches &s;eems rather to be on the other &s;ide: It will certainly
appear odd to us, that this liberty &s;hould be thought extravagant However,
the Queen, notwith&s;tanding her cajoling the hou&s;e, was &s;o ill &s;atisfied
with the&s;e proceedings, that &s;he &s;poke of them peevi&s;hly in her
concluding &s;peech, and told them, that &s;he perceived, that private
re&s;pects with them were privately ma&s;qued under public pre&s;ence. D'Ewes,
p. 619.</P> 
<P>There were &s;ome other topics, in favour of prerogative,
&s;till more extravagant, advanced in the hou&s;e this Parliament. When the
que&s;tion of the &s;ub&s;idy was before them, Mr. &s;erjeant Heyle &s;aid, Mr.
Speaker, I marvel much, that the hou&s;e &s;hould &s;tand upon granting of a
&s;ub&s;idy or the time of payment, when all we have is her maje&s;ty's, and
&s;he may lawfully at her plea&s;ure take it from us: Yea, &s;he hath as much
right to all our lands and goods as to any revenue of her crown. At which all
the hou&s;e hemmed, and laughed, and talked. Well, quoth &s;erjeant Heyle, all
your hemming &s;hall not put me out of countenance. So, Mr. Speaker &s;tood up
and &s;aid, It is a great di&s;order, that this &s;hould be u&s;ed.&mdash;So
the &s;aid &s;erjeant proceeded, and when he had &s;poken a little while, the
hou&s;e hemmed again; and &s;o he fat down. In his latter &s;peech, he &s;aid,
he could prove his former po&s;ition by pre|cedents in the time of Henry the
third, King John, King Stephen, &amp;c. which was the occa&s;ion of their
hemming. D'Ewes, p. 633. It is ob&s;ervable, that Heyle was an eminent lawyer,
a man of character. Winwood, vol. I. p. 290. And tho' the hou&s;e in general
&s;hewed their di&s;approbation, no one cared to take him down, or oppo&s;e
the&s;e extravagant po&s;itions. It was al&s;o a&s;&s;erted this &s;e&s;&s;ion,
that in the &s;ame manner as the Roman con&s;ul was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the
power of rejecting or admitting mo|tions in the &s;enate, the Speaker might
either admit or reject bills in the hou&s;e. D'Ewes, p. 677. The hou&s;e
declared them&s;elves again&s;t this opinion; but the very propo&s;al of it is
a proof at what a low ebb liberty was at that time in England.</P> 
<P>In the year 1591, the judges made a &s;olemn decree, that
England was an ab&s;olute empire, of which the King was the head. In
con&s;equence of this opinion, they determined, that even if the act of the
fir&s;t of Elizabeth had never been made, the King was &s;upreme head of the
church; and might have erected, by his prerogative, &s;uch a court as the
eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion: For that he was the head of all his
&s;ubjects. Now that court was plainly arbitrary: The inference is, that his
power was equally ab&s;olute over the laity. See Coke's Reports, p. 5.

rigour which &s;he had employed, and from which nothing but nece&s;&s;ity had
made her depart. Thus was this critical affair happily terminated; and
Eliza|beth, by prudently receding, in time, from her rights, maintained her
dignity, and pre&s;erved the affections of her people.</P>
<P>THE commons granted her a &s;upply very unprecedented, of four
&s;ub&s;idies and eight fifteenths; and they were even &s;o dutiful as to vote
this &s;upply before they received any &s;atisfaction in the bu&s;ine&s;s of
monopolies, which they ju&s;tly con&s;idered as of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence
to the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of the nation. Had they attempted to extort
that conce&s;&s;ion by keeping the &s;upply in &s;u&s;pence; &s;o haughty was
the Queen's di&s;po&s;ition, this appearance of con&s;traint and jealou&s;y had

E&s;&s;ex, and filled her with the deepe&s;t &s;orrow for the con&s;ent which
&s;he had unwarily given to his execution.</P>
<P>THE earl of E&s;&s;ex, after his return from the fortunate
expedition again&s;t Cadiz, ob&s;erving the increa&s;e of the Queen's fond
attachment towards him, took occa|&s;ion to regret, that the nece&s;&s;ity of
her &s;ervice required him often to be ab&s;ent from her per&s;on, and
expo&s;ed him to all tho&s;e ill offices which his enemies, more a&s;&s;iduous
in their attendance, could practi&s;e again&s;t him. She was moved with this
tender jealou&s;y; and making him the pre&s;ent of a ring, de&s;ired him to
keep that pledge of her affection, and a&s;&s;ured him, that in whatever
di&s;grace he &s;hould fall, whatever prejudices &s;he might be induced to
entertain again&s;t him, yet, if he &s;ent her that ring, &s;he would
immediately, upon the &s;ight of it, recollect her former tenderne&s;s, would
afford him again a h aring, and would lend a favour|able ear to his apology.
E&s;&s;ex, notwith&s;tanding all his misfortunes, re&s;erved this precious gift
to the la&s;t extremity; but after his trial and condemnation, he re&s;olved to
try the experiment, and he committed the ring to the counte&s;s of Nottingham,
whom he de&s;ired to deliver it to the Queen. The counte&s;s was pre|vailed on
by her hu&s;band, who was E&s;&s;ex's capital enemy, not to execute the
commi&s;&s;ion; and Elizabeth, who &s;till expected that her favourite would
make this appeal to her tenderne&s;s, and who a&s;cribed the neglect of it to
his invin|cible ob&s;tinacy, was, after much delay, and many internal combats,
pu&s;hed by re&s;entment and policy to &s;ign the warrant for his execution.
The counte&s;s of Nottingham, falling into &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;inding
her&s;elf approach towards her end, was &s;eized with remor&s;e for her
conduct; and having obtained a vi&s;it from the Queen, &s;he craved her pardon,
and revealed to her the fatal &s;ecret. The Queen, a&s;toni&s;hed with this
incident, bur&s;t into a &s;urious pa&s;&s;ion: She &s;hook the dying
counte&s;s in her bed; and crying to her, <HI>That God might pardon her, but
&s;he never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ould,</HI> &s;he broke
from her, and thenceforth re&s;igned her&s;elf over to the deepe&s;t

con&s;olation: She even refu&s;ed food and &s;u&s;tenance: And throwing
her&s;elf on the floor, &s;he kept her&s;elf &s;ilent and immoveable, feeding
her thoughts on her afflictions, and declaring life and exi&s;tence an
in&s;ufferable burthen to her. Few words &s;he uttered; and they were all
expre&s;&s;ive of &s;ome inward grief which &s;he cared not to reveal: But
&s;ighs and groans were the chief vent which &s;he gave to her de&s;pondency,
and which, tho' they di&s;covered her &s;orrows, were able to ea&s;e or abate
them. Ten days and nights &s;he lay upon the carpet, leaning on cu&s;hions
which her maids brought her; and her phy&s;icians could not per&s;uade her to
allow her&s;elf to be put to bed, much le&s;s to make trial of any remedies
which they pre&s;cribed to her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. No.

to know her mind with regard to her &s;ucce&s;&s;or. She an&s;wered with a

parti|cularly, &s;he &s;ubjoined, that &s;he would have a King to &s;ucceed
her; and who &s;hould that be but her neare&s;t kin&s;man, the King of Scots.
Being then advi&s;ed by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, to fix her thoughts
upon God, &s;he replied, that &s;he did &s;o, nor did her mind in the lea&s;t

factions, and what is more, of religious animo&s;ities, produced an uniform
judgment with regard to her conduct. Her vigour, her con&s;tancy, her
magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, addre&s;s, are allowed to merit the
high|e&s;t prai&s;es, and appear not to have been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by any
per&s;on who ever filled a throne: A conduct le&s;s rigorous, le&s;s imperious,
more &s;incere, more indulgent to her people, would have been requi&s;ite to
form a perfect character. By the force of her mind, &s;he controuled all her
more active and &s;tronger qualities, and <PB N="715" REF="320"> prevented them
from running into exce&s;s: Her heroi&s;m was exempt from all te|merity, her
frugality from avarice, her friend&s;hip from partiality, her enterprize from
turbulency and a vain ambition: She guarded not her&s;elf with equal care or
equal &s;ucce&s;s from le&s;&s;er infirmities; the rival&s;hip of beauty, the
de&s;ire of admiration, the jealou&s;y of love, and the &s;allies of anger.</P>
<P>HER &s;ingular talents for government were founded equally on
her temper and on her capacity. Endowed with a great command over her&s;elf,
&s;he &s;oon obtain|ed an uncontrouled a&s;cendant over her people; and while
&s;he merited all their e&s;teem by her real virtues, &s;he al&s;o engaged
their affection by her pretended ones. Few &s;overeigns of England &s;ucceeded
to the throne in more difficult circum|&s;tances; and none ever conducted the
government with &s;uch uniform &s;ucce&s;s and felicity. Tho' unacquainted with
the practice of toleration, the true &s;ecret for managing religious factions,
&s;he pre&s;erved her people, by her &s;uperior prudence, from tho&s;e
confu&s;ions in which theological controver&s;y had involved all the
neigh|bouring nations: And tho' her enemies were the mo&s;t powerful princes of
Eu|rope, the mo&s;t active, the mo&s;t enterprizing, the lea&s;t &s;crupulous,
&s;he was able by her vigour to make deep impre&s;&s;ions on their &s;tate: Her
own greatne&s;s mean|while remained untouched and unimpaired.</P>
<P>THE wi&s;e mini&s;ters, and brave warriors, who flouri&s;hed
during her reign, &s;hare the prai&s;e of her &s;ucce&s;s; but in&s;tead of
le&s;&s;ening the applau&s;e due to her, they make great addition to it. They
owed, all of them, their advancement to her choice; they were &s;upported by
her con&s;tancy; and with all their ability, they were never able to acquire
any undue a&s;cendant over her. In her family, in her court, in her kingdom,
&s;he remained equally mi&s;tre&s;s: The force of the tender pa&s;&s;ions was
great over her, but the force of her mind was &s;till &s;uperior; and the
combat which her victory vi&s;ibly co&s;t her, &s;erves only to di&s;play the
firmne&s;s of her re&s;olution, and the loftine&s;s of her ambitious
&s;entiments.</P>
<P>THE fame of this prince&s;s, tho' it has &s;urmounted the
prejudices both of fac|tion and of bigotry, yet lies &s;till expo&s;ed to
another prejudice, which is more durable becau&s;e more natural, and which,
according to the different views in which we &s;urvey her, is capable either of
exalting beyond mea&s;ure, or dimini&s;h|ing the lu&s;tre of her character.
This prejudice is founded on the con&s;ideration of her &s;ex. When we
contemplate her as a woman, we are apt to be &s;truck with the highe&s;t
admiration of her great qualities and exten&s;ive capacity; but we are al&s;o
apt to require &s;ome more &s;oftne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, &s;ome greater
lenity of temper, &s;ome of tho&s;e amiable weakne&s;&s;es by which her &s;ex
is di&s;tingui&s;hed. But the true method of e&s;timating her merit, is to lay
a&s;ide all the&s;e con&s;iderations, and to <PB N="716" REF="321"> con&s;ider
her merely as a rational being, placed in authority, and entru&s;ted with the
government of mankind. We may find it difficult to reconcile our fancy to her
as a wife or a mi&s;tre&s;s; but her qualities as a &s;overeign, tho' with
&s;ome con&s;iderable exceptions, are the object of undi&s;puted applau&s;e and
approba|tion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Government, manners, commerce, arts, and
learning.</NOTE> THE party among&s;t us who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves
by their adherence to liberty and a popular government, have long indulged
their prejudices again&s;t the &s;ucceeding race of princes, by be&s;towing
unbounded panegyrics on the virtue and wi&s;dom of Elizabeth. They have even
been &s;o extremely ignorant of the tran&s;actions of this reign, as to extol
her for a quality which, of all others, &s;he was the lea&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;t of;
a tender regard for the con&s;titution, and a concern for the liberties and
privileges of her people. But as it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for the
pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of party to throw a veil much longer over facts &s;o
palpable and unde|niable, there is danger le&s;t the public &s;hould run into
the oppo&s;ite extreme, and &s;hould entertain an aver&s;ion to the memory of a
prince&s;s who exerci&s;ed the royal authority in a manner &s;o much contrary
to all the ideas which we at pre&s;ent enter|tain of a legal con&s;titution.
But Elizabeth only &s;upported the prerogatives which were tran&s;mitted to her
by her immediate predece&s;&s;ors: She believed that her &s;ub|jects were
entitled to no more liberty than their ance&s;tors enjoyed: She found that they
entirely acquie&s;ced in her arbitrary admini&s;tration: And it was not
na|tural for her to find fault with a form of government, by which &s;he
her&s;elf was inve&s;ted with &s;uch unlimited authority. In the particular
exertions of power, the que&s;tion ought never to be forgot, <HI>What is
be&s;t?</HI> But in the general di&s;tri|bution of power among the &s;everal
members of a con&s;titution, there can &s;eldom be admitted any other
que&s;tion, than <HI>What is u&s;ual?</HI> Few examples occur of princes, who
have willingly re&s;igned their power: None of tho&s;e who have, without
&s;truggle, allowed it to be extorted from them. If any other rule than ancient
practice be followed, factions and di&s;&s;entions mu&s;t multiply w thout end:
And tho' many con&s;titutions, and none more than the Briti&s;h, have been
im|proved even by violent innovations, the prai&s;e which we be&s;tow on
tho&s;e patriots, to whom we are indebted for our privileges, ought to be given
with &s;ome re&s;erve, and &s;urely without the lea&s;t rancour again&s;t
tho&s;e who adhered to the ancient con&s;titution.</P>
<P>IN order to under&s;tand the ancient con&s;titution of England,
there is not a pe|riod which de&s;erves more to be &s;tudied than the reign of
Elizabeth. The pre|rogatives <PB N="717" REF="322"> of this prince&s;s were
&s;carce ever di&s;puted, and &s;he therefore employed them without &s;cruple:
Her imperious temper, a circum&s;tance in which &s;he went far beyond her
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors, rendered her exertions of power violent and frequent, and
di&s;covered the full extent of her authority: The great popularity which &s;he
enjoyed, proves, that the did not infringe any e&s;tabli&s;hed liberties of the
people: There remain monuments numerous enough to a&s; ertain the mo&s;t noted
acts of her admini&s;tration: And tho' th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e monument&punc; mu&s;t be &s;ought remote from the ordinary
hi&s;torians, they become only the more authenti on that account, and &s;erve
as a &s;tronger proof, that the particular exertions of her power were
conceiv|ed to be nothing but the ordinary cour&s;e of admini&s;tration, &s;ince
they were not thought remarkable enough to be recorded even by contemporary
writers. If there was any difference in this particular, the people, in former

open the &s;ources of that great power which the Engli&s;h monarchs for|merly
enjoyed.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t ancient and mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed
in&s;truments of power was the court of Star-chamber, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
an unlimited di&s;cretionary authority of fining, impri&s;oning, and inflict ng
corporal puni&s;hment, and who&s;e juri&s;|diction extended to all &s;orts of
offences, contempts, and di&s;orders, that lay not within reach of the common
law. The members of this court con|&s;i&s;ted of the privy council and the
judges; men, who all of them enjoyed their offices during plea&s;ure: And when
the prince him&s;elf was pre&s;ent, he was the &s;ole judge, and all the others
could only interpo&s;e with their advice. There needed but this one court in
any government, to put an end to all regular, legal, and exact plans of
liberty. For who dur&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">t

<P>THE court of High Commi&s;&s;ion was another juri&s;diction
&s;till more terrible, both becau&s;e the crime of here&s;y, of which it took

and impri&s;onments impo&s;ed by this court were frequent: The deprivations and
&s;u&s;pen&s;ions of the clergy for non-conformity, were al&s;o very numerous,
and comprehended at one time the third of all the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of
England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Neal, vol. I. p. 479.</NOTE>. The Queen,

<P>BUT Martial Law went far beyond even the&s;e two courts in a
prompt and arbi|trary and violent method of deci&s;ion. Whenever there was any
in&s;urrection or public di&s;order, the crown employed martial law; and it was
during that time exerci&s;ed not only over the &s;oldiers, but over the whole
people: Any one might be puni&s;hed as a rebel, or an aider and abettor of
rebellion, whom the provo&s;t|mar&s;hal or lieutenant of counties, or their
deputies, plea&s;ed to &s;u&s;pect. Lord Bacon &s;ays, that the trial at common
law granted the earl of E&s;&s;ex, and his fel|low con&s;pirators, was a
favour: For that the ca&s;e would have born and required the &s;everity of
martial law<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Vol. IV. p. 510.</NOTE>. We have
&s;een in&s;tances of its being employed by Queen Mary in defence of orthodoxy.
There remains a letter of Queen Elizabeth's to the earl of Suffex, after the
&s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the northern rebellion, in which &s;he reproves him
&s;harply, becau&s;e &s;he had not heard of his having done any execution by
martial law<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">MS. of lord Roy&s;ton's from the
Paper Office.</NOTE>. But the King of England did not always limit the
exerci&s;e of martial law to the times of war and rebellion. In 1552, when
there was no rebellion or in&s;urrection, King Edward granted a commi&s;&s;ion
of martial law; and empowered the commi&s;&s;ioners to execute it, <HI>as
&s;hould be thought by their di&s;cretions mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Strype's Eccle&s;. Memoirs, vol. II. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">, 458, 9.</NOTE>. Queen Elizabeth too
was not &s;paring in the u&s;e of martial law. In 1573, one Peter Burchet, a
puritan, being per&s;uaded that it was lawful or meritorious to kill &s;uch as
oppo&s;ed the truth of the go&s;pel, ran into the &s;treets, and wounded
Hawkins, the famous &s;ea-captain, whom he took for Hatton, the Queen's
fa|vourite. The Queen was &s;o incen&s;ed, that &s;he ordered him to be
puni&s;hed in|&s;tantly by martial law; but upon the remon&s;trance of &s;ome
prudent coun&s;ellors, who told her, that that law ought to be confined to
turbulent times, &s;he recalled her order, and delivered over Burchet to the
common law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 449. Strype, vol. II. p.
288.</NOTE>. But &s;he continued not always &s;o re&s;erved in exerting this
authority. There remains a proclamation of hers, where &s;he orders martial law
to be u&s;ed again&s;t all &s;uch as import bulls, or even forbidden books and
pamphlets from abroad<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III.
p. 570.</NOTE>; and prohibits the lieute|nants <PB N="719" REF="324"> or their

of|fenders, <HI>any law or &s;tatute to the contrary in any wi&s;e
notwith&s;tanding.</HI> We have another act of hers &s;till more extraordinary.
The &s;treets of London were very much infe&s;ted with idle vagabonds and
riotous per&s;ons: The lord mayor had endeavoured to repre&s;s this di&s;order:
The Star-chamber had exerted its authority, and inflicted puni&s;hment on
the&s;e rioters: But the Queen, finding tho&s;e remedies ineffectual, revived
martial law, and gave Sir Thomas Wilford a commi&s;&s;ion of
provo&s;t-mar&s;hal: 
<Q REND="inline">"Granting him authority, and commanding him,

<P>THE Star-chamber, and High Commi&s;&s;ion, and Court Martial,
tho' arbitrary juri&s;dictions, yet had &s;till &s;ome pretence of a trial, at
lea&s;t a &s;entence; but there was a grievous puni&s;hment very familiarly
inflicted in that age, without any other authority than the warrant of a
&s;ecretary of &s;tate, or of the privy council<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> to pri&s;on,
becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to pay the

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE>; and that was,
impri&s;onment, in any jail, and during any time, that the&s;e mini&s;ters
&s;hould think proper. In &s;u&s;picious times, all the jails were full of
pri&s;oners of &s;tate; and the&s;e unhappy victims of public jealou&s;y were
&s;ometimes thrown into dungeons, and loaded with irons, and treated in the
mo&s;t cruel manner, without any remedy from law.</P>
<P>THIS practice was an indirect way of employing torture: But the
ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">k it&s;elf was frequently
u&s;ed, upon any &s;u&s;picion, without other authority than a warrant from the
&s;ecretary or the privy council. Even the council in the marches of Wales were
empowered, by their very commi&s;&s;ion, to make u&s;e of torture, whenever
they thought proper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 196.</NOTE>. There
cannot be a &s;tronger proof how lightly the rack was employed, than the
following &s;tory, told by lord Bacon. We &s;hall give it in his own words. 
<Q REND="inline">"The Queen was mightily incented again&s;t
Haywarde, on account of a book he dedicated to lord E&s;&s;ex, being a &s;tory
of the fir&s;t year of King Henry the fourth, thinking it a &s;editious prelude
to put into <PB N="720" REF="325"> the people's heads boldne&s;s and faction:
She &s;aid, &s;he had an opinion that there was trea&s;on in it, and a&s;ked
me, if I could not find any places in it, that might be drawn within the ca&s;e
of trea&s;on: Whereto I an&s;wered, For trea&s;on, &s;ure I found none; but for
felony, very many: And when her maje&s;ty ha&s;tily a&s;ked me, wherein? I told
her, the author had committed very apparent theft: For he had taken mo&s;t of
the &s;entences of Cornelius Tacitus, and tran&s;lated them into Engli&s;h, and
put them into his text. And another time, when the Queen could not be
per&s;uaded, that it was his writing who&s;e name was to it, but that it had
&s;ome more mi&s;chievous author, and &s;aid with great indignation, that &s;he
would have him racked, to produce his author; I replied, nay, madam, he is a
doctor, never rack his per&s;on, but rack his &s;tile: Let him have pen, ink,
and paper, and help of books, and be enjoined to con|tinue the &s;tory where it
breaketh off, and I will undertake, by collating the &s;tyles, to judge whether
he were the author or no<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p.
81.</NOTE>."</Q> Thus, had it not been for Bacon's humanity, or rather his wit,
this author, a man of letters, had been put to the rack, for a mo&s;t innocent
performance. His real offence was, his de|dicating a book to that munificent
patron of the learned, the earl of E&s;&s;ex, at a time when this nobleman lay
under di&s;grace with her maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE Queen's menace of trying and puni&s;hing Haywarde for
trea&s;on, could ea&s;ily have been executed, let his book have been ever &s;o
innocent. While &s;o many terrors hung over the people's heads, no jury dur&s;t
have acquitted a man whom the court was re&s;olved to have condemned. The
practice al&s;o of not confronting the witne&s;&s;es with the pri&s;oner, gave
the crown lawyers all imagin|able advantages again&s;t him. And, indeed, there
occurs not one in&s;tance, dur|ing all the&s;e reigns, that the &s;overeign, or
the mini&s;ters, were ever di&s;appointed in the i&s;&s;ue of a pro&s;ecution.
Timid juries, and judges who held their offices during plea&s;ure, never failed
to &s;econd all the views of the court.</P>
<P>THE power of pre&s;&s;ing, and obliging any per&s;on to accept
of any office, was another prerogative totally incompatible with freedom.
O&s;borne gives the fol|lowing account of Elizabeth's method of employing this
prerogative. 
<Q REND="inline">"In ca&s;e &s;he &s;ound any likely to interrupt

which &s;he knew lea&s;t grateful to the people: Contrary to a fal&s;e maxim,
&s;ince practi&s;ed with far wor&s;e &s;ucce&s;s, by &s;uch princes as thought
it better husbandry to buy off enemies than reward friends<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>."</Q> The practice with which O&s;borne reproaches the two
immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Elizabeth, pro|ceeded <PB N="721" REF="326">
partly from the extreme difficulty of their &s;ituation, partly from the
greater lenity of their di&s;po&s;ition. The power of pre&s;&s;ing, as may
naturally be imagin|ed, was often abu&s;ed; and money was exacted by the
officers for freeing per&s;ons from the &s;ervice<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Murden, p. 181.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE government of England in that age, bore &s;ome re&s;emblance
to that of Turkey at pre&s;ent: The &s;overeign po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every power,
except that of impo&s;ing taxes: And in both countries this limitation,
un&s;upported by other privileges, appears rather prejudicial to the people. In
Turkey, it obliges the Sultan to per|mit the extortion of the ba&s;has and
governors of provinces, from whom he af|terwards &s;queezes pre&s;ents, or
takes forfeitures: In England, it engaged the Queen to erect monopolies, and
grant patents for exclu&s;ive trade: An invention &s;o pernicious, that had
&s;he gone on, during a tract of years, at her own rate, England, the &s;eat of
riches, arts, and commerce, would have contained at pre&s;ent as little
indu&s;try as Morocco, or the coa&s;t of Barbary.</P>
<P>WE may further ob&s;erve, that this valuable privilege, valuable
only becau&s;e it proved afterwards the means by which the Parliament extorted
all their other pri|vileges, was very much encroached on, in an indirect
manner, during the reign of Elizabeth, as well as of her predece&s;&s;ors. She
often exacted loans from her people; an arbitrary and unequal kind of
impo&s;ition, and which individuals felt &s;everely: For tho' the money had
been regularly re&s;tored, which was &s;eldom the ca&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. IV. p. 362.</NOTE>, it lay in the prince's hands
without intere&s;t, which was a &s;en&s;ible lo&s;s to the individuals from
whom the money was borrowed.</P>
<P>THERE remains a propo&s;al made by the lord Burleigh, for
levying a general loan on the people, equivalent to a &s;ub&s;idy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 518, 519</NOTE>; a &s;cheme which would
have laid the burthen more equally, but which was, in different words, nothing
but a taxation, impo&s;ed without con&s;ent of Parliament. It is remarkable,
that the &s;cheme, thus propo&s;ed, without any vi&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity, by
that wi&s;e mini&s;ter, is the very &s;ame which Henry the eighth attempted,
and which Charles the fir&s;t, en|raged by ill u&s;age from his Parliament, and
reduced to the greate&s;t difficulties, put afterwards in practice, to the
great di&s;content of the nation.</P>
<P>THE demand of benevolence was another invention of that age for
taxing the people. This practice was &s;o little conceived to be irregular,
that the commons, in 1585, offered the Queen a benevolence; which &s;he very
generou&s;ly refu&s;ed, as having no occa&s;ion, at that time, for money<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 494.</NOTE>. Queen Mary al&s;o, by an or|der of
council, increa&s;ed the cu&s;toms in &s;ome branches; and her &s;i&s;ter
imitated <PB N="722" REF="327"> the example<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. IV. p. 362.</NOTE>. There was a &s;pecies of
&s;hip-money impo&s;ed at the time of the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion. The &s;everal
ports were required to equip a certain number of &s;hips at their own charge;
and &s;uch was the alacrity of the people for the public defence, that &s;ome
of the ports, particularly London, &s;ent double the number demanded of
them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 267.</NOTE>. When any levies were
made for Ireland, France, or the Low Countries, the Queen obliged the counties
to rai&s;e the &s;oldiers, to arm and clothe them, and carry them to the
&s;ea-ports at their own charge. New-Year's-Gifts were, at that time, expected
from the nobility, and from the more con&s;i|derable gentry<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memor. vol. I. p. 137.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PURVEYANCE was another method of taxation, unequal, arbitrary,
and op|pre&s;&s;ive. The whole kingdom felt &s;en&s;ibly the burthen of this
impo&s;ition; and it was regarded as a great privilege which was conferred on
Oxford and Cam|bridge, to prohibit the purveyors from taking any commodities
within five miles of the&s;e univer&s;ities. The Queen victualled her navy by
means of this preroga|tive, during the fir&s;t years of her government<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 388.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WARDSHIP was the mo&s;t regular and legal of all the&s;e
impo&s;itions by prero|gative: Yet was it a great badge of &s;lavery, and
oppre&s;&s;ive to the great families. When an e&s;tate fell to a female, the
&s;overeign obliged her to marry any one he plea&s;ed: Whether the heir was
male or female, the crown enjoyed the whole profit of the rents during the
minority. The giving a rich ward&s;hip was an u&s;ual method of rewarding a
courtier or favourite.</P>
<P>THE inventions were endle&s;s, which arbitrary power might
employ for extorting of money, while the people imagined that their property
was &s;ecured by debarring the crown from impo&s;ing taxes. Strype has
pre&s;erved a &s;peech of lord Burleigh to the Queen and council, wherein are
contained &s;ome particulars not a little extra|ordinary<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Annals, vol. IV. p. 234, &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>. Burleigh propo&s;es
that &s;he &s;hould erect a court for the correction of all abu&s;es, and
&s;hould confer on the commi&s;&s;ioners a general inqui&s;itorial power over
the whole kingdom. He &s;ets before her eyes the example of her wi&s;e
grand|father, Henry the &s;eventh, who, by &s;uch methods, augmented extremely
his revenue; and he recommends, that this new court &s;hould proceed, 
<Q REND="inline">"as well by the direction and ordinary cour&s;e
of the laws, as by virtue of her maje&s;ty's &s;u|preme regiment and
<HI>ab&s;olute power, from whence law proceeded.</HI>"</Q> In a word, he
expects from this in&s;titution, greater acce&s;&s;ion to the royal trea&s;ure,
than Henry the eighth derived from the abolition of the abbeys, and all the
forfeitures of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues. This project of lord Burleigh
needs not, I think, <PB N="723" REF="328"> any comment. A form of government
mu&s;t be very arbitrary, where a wi&s;e and good mini&s;ter could make &s;uch
a propo&s;al to the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>EMBARGOES on merchandize was another engine of royal power, by
which the Engli&s;h princes were able to extort money from the people. We have
&s;een in&s;tances in the reign of Mary. Elizabeth, before her coronation,
i&s;&s;ued an or|der to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, prohibiting the &s;ale of all
crim&s;on &s;ilks which &s;hould be imported, till the court was fir&s;t
provided<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 27.</NOTE>. She expected,
no doubt, a good penny-worth from the merchants, while they lay under this
re&s;traint.</P>
<P>THE Parliament pretended to the right of enacting laws, as well
as of grant|ing &s;ub&s;idies; but this privilege was, during that age, &s;till
more in&s;ignificant than the other. Queen Elizabeth expre&s;sly prohibited
them from meddling with &s;tate matters or eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es; and
&s;he openly &s;ent the members to pri&s;on, who dared to tran&s;gre&s;s her
imperial edict in the&s;e particulars. There pa&s;&s;ed few Par|liaments,
during her reign, where there occur not in&s;tances of this arbitrary
conduct.</P>
<P>BUT the legi&s;lative power of the Parliament was a mere
fallacy, while the &s;o|vereign was univer&s;ally acknowleged to po&s;&s;e&s;s
a di&s;pen&s;ing power, by which all the laws could be invalidated, and
rendered of no effect. The u&s;e of this power was al&s;o an indirect method
practi&s;ed for erecting monopolies. Where the &s;tatutes laid any branch of
manufacture under re&s;trictions, the &s;overeign, by exempting one per&s;on
from the laws, gave him in effect the monopoly of that commodity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. W. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> D'Ewes, 4. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>. There was no grievance, at
that time, more univer&s;ally complained of, than the frequent di&s;pen&s;ing
with the penal laws<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT in reality, the crown po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the full
legi&s;lative power, by means of pro|clamations, which might affect any
&s;ubject of the greate&s;t importance, and which the Star-chamber took care to
&s;ee more rigorou&s;ly executed than the laws them|&s;elves. The motives of
the&s;e proclamations were &s;ometimes very ridiculous. Queen Elizabeth had
taken offence at the &s;mell of woad; and &s;he i&s;&s;ued an edict prohibiting
any one to cultivate that u&s;eful plant<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Town&s;end's Journal, p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">0. Stow's Annals.</NOTE>. She was al&s;o plea&s;ed to take offence
at the long &s;words and high ruffs then in fa&s;hion: She &s;ent about
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> officers, to break every man's
&s;word, and clip every man's ruff, which was be|yond a certain length<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Town&s;end's Journal, p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">0. Stow's Annals.

&s;omewhat the method employ|ed by the great Czar Peter, to make his &s;ubjects
change their garb.</P>
<P><PB N="724" REF="329"> THE Queen's prohibition of the
prophe&s;yings was founded on a better rea&s;on&punc; but &s;hews &s;till the
unlimited extent of her prerogative. Two or three people could not meet
together, in order to read the &s;criptures, and confer about reli|gion, tho'
in ever &s;o orthodox a manner, without her permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THERE were many other branches of prerogative incompatible with
an exact or regular enjoyment of liberty. None of the nobility could marry
without per|mi&s;&s;ion from the &s;overeign. The Queen detained the earl of
Southampton long in pri&s;on, becau&s;e he privately married the earl of
E&s;&s;ex's cou&s;in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p.
422.</NOTE>. No man could travel without the con&s;ent of the prince. Sir
William Evers underwent a &s;evere per&s;ecution, becau&s;e he had pre&s;umed
to pay a private vi&s;it to the King of Scots<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 511.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament in the thirteenth of the Queen prai&s;ed her for
not imitating the practice, u&s;ual among her predece&s;&s;ors, of &s;topping
the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice by particular warrants<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 141.</NOTE>. There could not po&s;&s;ibly be a greater
abu&s;e, nor a &s;tronger mark of arbitrary power; and the Queen, in refraining
from it, was very laudable. But &s;he was by no means con&s;tant in this
re&s;erve. There remain in the public records &s;ome warrants of her's for
exempting per&s;ons from all law-&s;uits and pro|&s;ecutions<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XV. p. 652, 708, 777.</NOTE>; and the&s;e warrants,
&s;he &s;ays, &s;he grants from her royal prerogative, which &s;he will not
allow to be di&s;puted.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to imagine, that, in &s;uch a government, no
ju&s;tice could, by cour&s;e of law, be obtained of the &s;overeign, unle&s;s
he was willing to allow it. In the naval expedition, undertaken by Raleigh and
Forbi&s;her again&s;t the Spaniards, in 1592, a very rich carrack was taken
worth two hundred thou&s;and pounds. The Queen's &s;hare in the adventure was
only a tenth part; but as the prize was &s;o great, and exceeded &s;o much the
expectations of all the adventurers, &s;he was determined not to re&s;t
contented with her &s;hare. Raleigh, humbly and earne&s;tly, begged her to
accept of an hundred thou&s;and pounds, in lieu of all demands, or rather
exactions; and &s;ays, that the pre&s;ent, which the proprietors were willing
to make her of eighty thou&s;and pounds, was the greate&s;t that ever a prince
re|ceived from a &s;ubject<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p.
128, 129.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT it is no wonder the Queen, in her admini&s;tration, &s;hould
pay &s;o little re|gard to liberty; while the parliament it&s;elf, in enacting
laws, were &s;o entirely negligent of it. The per&s;ecuting &s;tatutes, which
they pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t papi&s;ts and puritans, are extremely contrary to the
genius of freedom; and by expo&s;ing &s;uch multitudes to the tyranny of
prie&s;ts and bigots, accu&s;tomed the people to the <PB N="725" REF="330">
mo&s;t di&s;graceful &s;ubjection. Their conferring an unlimited &s;upremacy on
the Queen, or what is wor&s;e, acknowleging her inherent right to it, was
another proof of their voluntary &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>THE law of the 23d of her reign, making &s;editious words
again&s;t the Queen capital, is another very tyrannical &s;tatute; and an
u&s;e, no le&s;s tyrannical, was &s;ometimes made of it. The ca&s;e of Udal, a
puritannical clergyman, &s;eems &s;ingular, even in tho&s;e arbitrary times.
This man had publi&s;hed a book called a demon&s;tration of di&s;cipline, in
which he inveighed again&s;t the government of bi&s;hops; and tho' he had
carefully endeavoured to conceal his name, he was thrown into pri&s;on upon
&s;u&s;picion, and brought to his trial for this offence. It was pretended,
that the bi&s;hops were part of the Queen's political body; and to &s;peak
again&s;t them, was really to attack her, and was therefore felony by the
&s;tatute. This was not the only iniquity, to which Udal was expo&s;ed. The
judges would not allow the jury to determine any thing but the fact, whether
Udal had wrote the book, or not, without examining his intention, or the
im|port of the words. In order to prove the fact, the crown lawyers did not
pro|duce a &s;ingle witne&s;s to the court: They only read the te&s;timony of
two per&s;ons ab&s;ent, one of which &s;aid that Udal had told him he was the
author; another, that a friend of Udal's had &s;aid &s;o. They would not allow
Udal to produce any exculpatory evidence; which, they &s;aid, was never to be
permitted again&s;t the Queen. And they tendered him an oath, by which he was
required to &s;wear, that he was not author of the book; and his refu&s;al to
give that te&s;timony was employed as the &s;tronge&s;t proof of his guilt. It
is almo&s;t needle&s;s to add, that, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e multiplied
iniquities, a verdict of death was given by the jury again&s;t Udal: For as the
Queen was extremely bent upon his pro&s;ecution, it was impo&s;&s;ible he could
e&s;cape<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 144. Strype, vol. IV.

execution of the &s;entence.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e of Penry was, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till harder. This
man was a zealous pu|ritan, or rather a Browni&s;t; and he had wrote again&s;t
the hierarchy &s;everal tracts, &s;uch as Martin Mar-prelate, <HI>The&s;es
Martinianae,</HI> and other compo&s;itions full of low &s;currility and
petulant &s;atyre. After concealing him&s;elf for &s;ome years, he was
&s;eized; and as the &s;tatute again&s;t &s;editious words required that the
crimi|nal &s;hould be tried within a year after committing the offence, he
could not be indicted for his printed books. He was therefore tried for &s;ome
papers found in his pocket, as if he had thereby &s;cattered &s;edition<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Whitgift, book IV. chap. II. Neal,
vol. I. p. 564.</NOTE>. It was al&s;o imputed to him, by the lord keeper,
Puckering, that in &s;ome of the&s;e papers, 
<Q REND="inline">"he had only acknow|leged <PB N="726" REF="331">

mo&s;t ab&s;olute authority<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p.
177.</NOTE>."</Q> Penry for the&s;e offences was condemned and executed.</P>
<P>THUS we have &s;een, that <HI>the mo&s;t ab&s;olute</HI>
authority of the &s;overeign, to make u&s;e of the lord keeper's phra&s;e, was
e&s;tabli&s;hed on above twenty branches of pre|rogative, which are now
aboli&s;hed, and which were, every one of them, totally incompatible with the
liberty of the &s;ubject. But what en&s;ured more effectually the &s;lavery of
the people, than even the&s;e branches of prerogative, was, the
e&s;ta|bli&s;hed principles of the times, which attributed to the prince &s;uch
an ab&s;olute and indefeizable authority, as was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the origin
of all law, and could be bound and circum&s;cribed by none. The homilies,
publi&s;hed for the u&s;e of the clergy, and which they were enjoined to read
every Sunday in all the churches, inculcate every where a blind, and unlimited
pa&s;&s;ive-obedience to the prince, which, on no account, and under no
pretence, is it ever lawful for them, in the &s;malle&s;t article, to depart
from or infringe. Much noi&s;e has been made, becau&s;e &s;ome court chaplains,
during the &s;ucceeding reigns, were permitted to preach &s;uch doctrines; but
there is a great difference between the&s;e &s;ermons, and di&s;cour&s;es
publi&s;hed by authority, avowed by the prince and council, and promulgated to
the whole nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gifford, a clergyman, was
&s;u&s;pended in 1584, for preaching up a limited obedience to the civil
magi&s;trate. Neal, vol. I. p. 435.</NOTE>. So thoroughly were the&s;e
principles imbibed by the people, during the reigns of Elizabeth and her
predece&s;&s;ors, that oppo&s;ition to them was regarded as the mo&s;t flagrant
&s;edition, and was not even rewarded by that public prai&s;e and approbation,
which can alone &s;upport men under &s;uch dangers and difficulties, as attend
the re&s;i&s;tance of tyrannical authority. It was only during the next
generation that the noble principles of liberty took root, and &s;preading
them&s;elves, under the &s;helter of puritannical ab&s;urdities, became
fa&s;hionable among the people.</P>
<P>IT is worth remarking, that the advantage, u&s;ually a&s;cribed
to ab&s;olute mo|narchy, a greater regularity of police and a more &s;trict
execution of the laws, did not attend the antient Engli&s;h government, tho' in
many re&s;pects it fell under that denomination: A demon&s;tration of this
truth is contained in a judicious paper, which is pre&s;erved by Strype<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Annals, vol. IV. p. 290. &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>, and
which was wrote by an eminent ju&s;|tice of peace of Somer&s;et&s;hire, in the
year 1596, near the end of the Queen's reign, when the authority of that
prince&s;s may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be fully corrobo|rated by time, and her
maxims of government improved by long practice. This <PB N="727" REF="332">
paper contains an account of the di&s;orders which then prevailed in the county
of Somer&s;et. The author &s;ays, that forty per&s;ons had been there executed
in a year for robberies, thefts, and other felonies; thirty-five burnt in the
hand, thirty-&s;even whipt, one hundred and eighty-three di&s;charged: That
tho&s;e who were di&s;charged were mo&s;t wicked and de&s;perate per&s;ons, who
never could come to any good, becau&s;e they would not work, and none would
take them into &s;ervice: That notwith&s;tanding this great number of
indictments, the fifth part of the felonies committed in the county were not
brought to a trial, the greater number e&s;caped cen&s;ure, either from the
&s;uperior cunning of the &s;elons, the re|mi&s;&s;ne&s;s of the magi&s;trates,
or the fooli&s;h lenity of the people: That the rapines committed by the
infinite number of wicked, wandering, idle people were into|lerable to the poor
countrymen, and obliged them to a perpetual watch of their &s;heep-folds, their
pa&s;tures, their woods and their corn-fields: That the other counties of
England were in no better condition than Somer&s;et&s;hire; and many of them
were even in a wor&s;e: That there were at lea&s;t three or four hundred
able|bodied vagabonds in every county, who lived by theft and rapine; and who
&s;ometimes met in troops to the number of &s;ixty, and committed &s;poil on
the in|habitants: That if all the felons of this kind were a&s;&s;embled, they
would be able, if reduced to good &s;ubjection, to give the greate&s;t enemy
her maje&s;ty has a &s;trong battle: And that the magi&s;trates them&s;elves
were intimidated from executing ju&s;|tice upon them; and there were examples
of ju&s;tices of peace, who, after giving &s;entence again&s;t rogues, had
interpo&s;ed to &s;top the execution of their own &s;en|tence, for fear of the
danger, which hung over them from the confederates of the&s;e felons.</P>
<P>IN the year 1575, the Queen complained in Parliament of the bad
execution of the laws; and threatened, if the magi&s;trates were not, for the
future, more vigilant, that &s;he would entru&s;t authority to indigent and
needy per&s;ons, who would find an intere&s;t in the more exact di&s;tribution
of ju&s;tice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 23<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. It appears, that &s;he was as good as her
word. For in 1601, there were great complaints made in Parliament of the rapine
of ju&s;tices of peace; and a member &s;aid, that this magi&s;trate was an
animal, who, for half a dozen of chickens, would
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">pen&s;e with a dozen of penal
&s;tatutes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p 661-664.</NOTE>. It is
not ea&s;y to account for this relaxation of government, and neglect of police
during a reign of &s;o much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> as
that of Elizabeth. The &s;mall revenue of the crown is the mo&s;t likely cause
that can be a&s;&s;igned. The Queen had it not in her power to intere&s;t a
great number in a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing her to execute the laws.</P>
<P><PB N="728" REF="333"> ON the whole, the Engli&s;h have no
rea&s;on, from the example of their an|ce&s;tors, to be in love with the
picture of ab&s;olute monarchy; or to prefer the un|limited authority of the
prince, and his unbounded prerogatives, to that noble liberty, that &s;weet
equality, and that happy &s;ecurity, by which they are at pre|&s;ent
di&s;tingui&s;hed above all nations of the univer&s;e. The utmo&s;t that can be
&s;aid in favour of the antient government (and perhaps it may be &s;aid with
truth) is, that the power of the prince, tho' really unlimited, was exerci&s;ed
after the European manner, and entered not into every part of the
admini&s;tration; that the in&s;tances of a high exerted prerogative were not
&s;o frequent as to render pro|perty &s;en&s;ibly in&s;ecure, or reduce the
people to a total &s;ervitude; that the free|dom from faction, the quickne&s;s
of execution, and the promptitude of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which could be taken
for offence or defence, made &s;ome compen&s;ation for the want of a legal and
determined liberty; that as the prince commanded no mercenary army, there was a
tacit check on him, which maintained the go|vernment in that medium, to which
the people had been accu&s;tomed; and that this &s;ituation of England was in
reality more remote, tho' &s;eemingly it approached nearer, a de&s;potic and
ea&s;tern monarchy, than the pre&s;ent government of that kingdom, where the
people, tho' guarded by multiplied laws, are totally naked, defencele&s;s, and
di&s;armed.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall clo&s;e this volume with a brief account of the
revenues, the mili|tary force, the commerce, the arts, and the learning of
England during this period.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth's oeconomy was very remarkable; and in &s;ome
in&s;tances &s;eemed to border on avarice. The &s;malle&s;t expence, if it
could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;aved, ap|peared con&s;iderable in her eyes; and even
the charge of an expre&s;s, during the mo&s;t delicate tran&s;actions, was not
below her notice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Negot. p. 21.</NOTE>. She was
al&s;o attentive to every profit; and embraced opportunities of gain, which may
appear &s;omewhat extraordinary. She kept the &s;ee of Ely vacant nineteen
years, in order to pocket the revenue<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype,
vol. IV. p. 351.</NOTE>; and it was u&s;ual with her, when &s;he promoted a
bi&s;hop, to take the opportunity of pillaging the &s;ee of &s;ome of its
manors<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 215.</NOTE>. But that there was
in reality little or no avarice in the Queen's temper appears from this
circum|&s;tance, that &s;he never ama&s;&s;ed any trea&s;ure; and even
refu&s;ed &s;ub&s;idies from the Parliament, when &s;he had no pre&s;ent
occa&s;ion for them. Yet we mu&s;t not con|clude from this circum&s;tance, that
her oeconomy proceeded from a tender concern for her people: She loaded them
with monopolies and exclu&s;ive patents, which are infinitely more
oppre&s;&s;ive than the mo&s;t heavy taxes, levied in a legal and re|gular 
<PB N="729" REF="334"> manner. The real &s;ource of her frugal conduct was
derived from her de|&s;ire of independency, and her care to pre&s;erve her
dignity, which would have been endangered, had &s;he reduced her&s;elf to the
nece&s;&s;ity of having frequent recour&s;e to parliamentary &s;upplies. In
con&s;equence of this motive, the Queen, tho' en|gaged in &s;ucce&s;sful and
nece&s;&s;ary wars, thought it more prudent to make a con|tinual dilapidation
of the royal deme&s;nes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 141.
D'Ewes, p. 151, 457, 525, 629. Bacon, vol. IV. p. 363.</NOTE>, than demand the
mo&s;t moderate &s;up|plies from the commons. As &s;he lived unmarried and had
no po&s;terity, &s;he was contented to &s;erve her pre&s;ent turn, tho' at the
expence of her &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who, by rea&s;on of this policy, joined to
other accidents, found them&s;elves, on a &s;udden, reduced to the mo&s;t
extreme indigence.</P>
<P>THE &s;plendor of a court was, during this age, a great part of
the public charge; and as Elizabeth was a &s;ingle woman, and expen&s;ive in no
&s;pecies of magnificence, except cloaths, this circum&s;tance enabled her to
perform great things by her narrow revenue. She is &s;aid to have paid four
millions of debt, left on the crown by her father, brother and &s;i&s;ter; an
incredible &s;um for that age<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 473. I
think it impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile this account of the public debts with that
given by Strype, Eccle&s;. Mem. vol. II. p. 344. that in the year 1553, the
crown owed but 300,000 pounds. I own, that this la&s;t &s;um appears a great
deal more likely. The whole revenue of Queen Elizabeth would not in ten years
have paid four millions.</NOTE>. The &s;tates at the time of her death owed her
about eight hundred thou&s;and pounds: And the King of France four hundred and
fifty thou&s;and<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 29,

tho&s;e &s;ums, which &s;he had &s;o generou&s;ly ad|vanced him, during his

<P>IT is difficult to compute exactly the Queen's ordinary revenue,
but it certainly fell much &s;hort of five hundred thou&s;and pounds a year. In
1590, &s;he rai&s;ed the cu&s;toms from fourteen thou&s;and pounds a year to
fifty thou&s;and pounds; and obliged Sir Thomas Smith, who had farmed them, to
refund &s;ome of his former profits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 558.
This account of Camden is difficult or impo&s;&s;ible to be reconciled to the
&s;tate of the cu&s;toms in the beginning of the &s;ub&s;equent reign, as they
appear in the journals of the commons. See Hi&s;t. of Great Britain, vol. I.
chap. 1.</NOTE>. This improvement of the revenue was owing to the
&s;ugge&s;tions of one Caermarden; and was extremely oppo&s;ed by Burleigh,
Leice&s;ter, and Wal|&s;ingham. But the Queen's pre&s;everance overcame all
their oppo&s;ition. The great undertakings, which &s;he executed with &s;o
narrow a revenue, and with &s;uch &s;mall &s;upplies from her people, prove the
mighty effects of wi&s;dom and oecono|my. She received from the Parliament,
during the cour&s;e of her whole reign, only twenty &s;ub&s;idies and
thirty-nine fifteenths. It is not ea&s;y to compute ex|actly the amount of
the&s;e &s;upplies; becau&s;e the value of a &s;ub&s;idy was continually
falling; and in the end of her reign it amounted only to eighty thou&s;and
pounds<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 630.</NOTE>, which in the
beginning had been an hundred and twenty thou&s;and. If we &s;up|po&s;e that
the whole &s;upplies granted Elizabeth during a reign of forty-five years
amounted to three millions, we &s;hall not probably be much wide of the truth.
This &s;um makes only &s;ixty-&s;ix thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix
pounds a year; and it is &s;urprizing, that while the Queen's demands were &s;o
moderate, and her expences &s;o well regulated, &s;he &s;hould ever have found
any difficulty of getting a &s;upply from the Parliament, or be reduced to make
&s;ale of the crown-lands. But &s;uch was the extreme, I had almo&s;t &s;aid,
ab&s;urd par&s;imony of the Parlia|ments during that period. They valued
nothing in compari&s;on of their money: The members had no connexion with the
court; and the very idea, which they conceived of the tru&s;t committed to
them, was, to reduce the demands of the crown, and to grant as few &s;upplies
as po&s;&s;ible. The crown, on the other hand, conceived the Parliament in no
other light than a means of &s;upply. Queen Elizabeth made a merit to her
people of &s;eldom a&s;&s;embling Parliaments<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p. 124.</NOTE>. No redre&s;s of grievances was
expected from the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies: They were &s;uppo&s;ed to meet for no
other purpo&s;e than to impo&s;e taxes.</P>
<P><PB N="731" REF="336"> BEFORE Queen Elizabeth's reign, the
Engli&s;h princes had always recour&s;e to the city of Antwerp for voluntary
loans; and their credit was &s;o low, that, be|&s;ides the exorbitant
intere&s;t of ten or twelve per cent, they were obliged to make the city of
London join in the &s;ecurity. Sir Thomas Gre&s;ham, that great and
enterprizing merchant, one of the chief ornaments of this reign, engaged the
company of merchant-adventurers to grant a loan to the Queen; and as the money
was regularly paid, her credit by degrees e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf in the city,
and &s;he &s;hook off this dependance on foreigners<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe's Survey of London, book I. p. 286.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1559, the Queen employed Gre&s;ham to borrow for her two
hundred thou|&s;and pounds at Antwerp, in order to enable her to reform the
coinage, which was at that time extremely deba&s;ed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">MS. of lord Roy&s;ton's from the paper office, p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">95.</NOTE>. She was &s;o unpolitic
as to make her&s;elf an innovation in the coin; by dividing a pound of &s;ilver
into &s;ixty-two &s;hillings, in&s;tead of &s;ixty, the former &s;tandard. This
is the la&s;t time, that the coin has been tampered with in England.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth, &s;en&s;ible how much the defence of her
kingdom depended on its naval power, was de&s;irous to encourage commerce and
navigation: But as her monopolies tended to extingui&s;h all dome&s;tic
indu&s;try, which is much more valuable than foreign trade, and is the
foundation of it, the general train of her conduct was very ill calculated to
&s;erve the purpo&s;e at which &s;he aimed, much le&s;s to promote the riches
of her people. The exclu&s;ive companies al&s;o were an immediate check on
foreign trade. Yet, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;couragements, the &s;pirit
of the age was &s;trongly bent on naval enterprizes; and be&s;ides the
mi|litary expeditions again&s;t the Spaniards, many attempts were made for new
di&s;|coveries, and many new branches of foreign commerce were opened by the
Eng|li&s;h. Sir Martin Forbi&s;her undertook three fruitle&s;s voyages to
di&s;cover the north|we&s;t pa&s;&s;age: Davis, not di&s;heartened by this ill
&s;ucce&s;s, made a new attempt, when he di&s;covered the &s;traits, which
pa&s;s by his name. In 1600, the Queen granted the fir&s;t patent to the Ea&s;t
India company: The &s;tock of that company was &s;eventy-two thou&s;and pounds;
and they fitted out four &s;hips, under the command of James Lanca&s;ter, for
this new branch of trade. The adventure was &s;ucce&s;sful; and the &s;hips
returning with a rich cargo, encouraged the com|pany to continue that
commerce.</P>
<P>THE communication with Mu&s;covy had been opened in Queen Mary's
time by the di&s;covery of the pa&s;&s;age to Archangel: But the commerce to
that country began not to be carried to a great extent till about the year
15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">9. The Queen 
<PB N="732" REF="337"> obtained from the Czar an exclu&s;ive patent to the
Engli&s;h for the whole trade to Mu&s;covy<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 408.</NOTE>; and &s;he entered into a per&s;onal, as
well as national, alliance with him. This Czar was named John Ba&s;ilides, a
mo&s;t furious tyrant, who &s;u&s;pect|ing continually the revolt of his
&s;ubjects, &s;tipulated a &s;afe retreat and protection in England. In order
the better to en&s;ure him&s;elf of this re&s;ource, he propo&s;ed to marry an
Engli&s;h woman, and the Queen intended to have &s;ent him the lady Anne
Ha&s;tings, daughter to the earl of Huntingdon: But when the lady was informed
of the barbarous manners of the country, &s;he wi&s;ely declined pur|cha&s;ing
an empire at the expence of her ea&s;e and &s;afety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 493.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h, encouraged by the privileges, which they had
obtained from Ba&s;ilides, ventured farther into the&s;e countries, than any
Europeans had for|merly done. They tran&s;ported their goods along the river
Dwina in boats made of one entire tree, which they towed and rowed up the
&s;tream as far as Walogda. From thence, they carried them &s;even days journey
by land to Yera&s;tau, and then down the Volga to A&s;tracan. At A&s;tracan,
they built &s;hips, cro&s;&s;ed the Ca&s;pian Sea, and di&s;tributed their
commodities into Per&s;ia. But this bold at|tempt met with &s;uch
di&s;couragements that it was never renewed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 418.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of John Ba&s;ilides, his &s;on Theodore revoked
the patent, which the Engli&s;h enjoyed for a monopoly of the Ru&s;&s;ian
trade; and when the Queen remon&s;trated again&s;t this innovation, he told her
mini&s;ters, that princes mu&s;t carry an indifferent hand, as well between
their &s;ubjects as between fo|reigners; and not convert trade, which by the
laws of nations ought to be com|mon to all, into a monopoly for the private
gain of a few<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 493.</NOTE>. So much
ju&s;ter notions of commerce were entertained by this barbarian, than were
practi&s;ed by the renowned Queen Elizabeth! Theodore, however, continued
&s;ome privi|leges to the Engli&s;h, on account of their being the fir&s;t
di&s;coverers of the com|munication between Europe and his country.</P>
<P>THE trade to Turkey was begun about 1583; and that commerce was
imme|diately confined to a company by Queen Elizabeth. Before that time, the
grand &s;ignior had always conceived England to be a dependant province of
France<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. I. p. 36.</NOTE>;
but having heard of the Queen's power and reputation, he gave a good recep|tion
to the Engli&s;h, and even granted them larger privileges than he had given to
the French.</P>
<P>THE merchants of the Han&s;e-towns complained loudly in the
beginning of Eli|zabeth's reign of the treatment, which they had received in
the days of King <PB N="733" REF="338"> Edward and Queen Mary. She very
prudently replied, that as &s;he would not innovate any thing, &s;he would
protect them &s;till in the immunities and privileges, which &s;he found them
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. This an&s;wer not contenting them, their com|merce was
&s;oon after &s;u&s;pended for a time, to the great advantage of the Engli&s;h
merchants, who tried what they could them&s;elves effectuate for the promotion
of their commerce. They took the whole trade into their own hands; and their
returns proving &s;ucce&s;sful, they divided them&s;elves into &s;taplers and
merchant|adventurers; the former re&s;iding con&s;tantly at one place, the
other trying their fortunes in other towns and &s;tates abroad with cloth and
other manufactures. This &s;ucce&s;s &s;o enraged the Han&s;e-towns, that they
tried all the methods, which a di&s;contented people could devi&s;e, to draw
upon the Engli&s;h merchants the ill opinion of other nations and &s;tates.
They prevailed &s;o far as to obtain an im|perial edict, by which the Engli&s;h
merchants were prohibited all commerce in the empire: The Queen, by way of
retaliation, retained &s;ixty of their &s;hips, which had been &s;eized in the
river of Li&s;bon with contraband goods of the Spa|niards. The&s;e &s;hips the
Queen intended to have re&s;tored, as de&s;iring to have compromi&s;ed all
differences with tho&s;e trading cities; but when &s;he was informed, that a
general a&s;&s;embly was held at Lubec, in order to concert mea&s;ures for
di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing the Engli&s;h trade, &s;he cau&s;ed the &s;hips and cargoes
to be confi&s;cated; only two of them were relea&s;ed to carry home the news,
and to inform the&s;e &s;tates, that &s;he had the greate&s;t contempt
imaginable for all their proceedings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lives of the
Admirals. vol. I. p. 470.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY the eighth, in order to fit out a navy, was obliged to
hire &s;hips from Hamburg, Lubec, Dantzick, Genoa, and Venice: But Elizabeth,
very early in her reign, put affairs upon a better footing; both by building
&s;ome &s;hips of her own, and by encouraging the merchants to build large
trading ve&s;&s;els, which, on occa&s;ion, were converted into &s;hips of
war<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 388.</NOTE>. In 1582, the
&s;eamen in Eng|land were computed at fourteen thou&s;and two hundred and
ninety-five men<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 250.</NOTE>; the
number of ve&s;&s;els twelve hundred and thirty-two; of which there were only
two hundred and &s;eventeen above eighty tons. Mon&s;on computes, that tho' the
navigation decayed in the fir&s;t years of James the fir&s;t, by the practice
of the merchants, who carried on their trade in foreign bottoms<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 300.</NOTE>, yet before 1640, this number of
&s;eamen was trebled in England<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 210,
256.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE navy which the Queen left at her decea&s;e appears
con&s;iderable, when we con&s;ider only the number of ve&s;&s;els, which were
forty-two: But when we re|flect that none of the&s;e &s;hips carried above
forty guns; that four only came up <PB N="734" REF="339"> to that number; that
there were but two &s;hips of a thou&s;and ton; and twenty-three below five
hundred, &s;ome of fifty, and &s;ome even of twenty tons; that the whole number
of the guns belonging to the fleet were &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-four<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 196. The Engli&s;h navy at pre&s;ent carries
about 14000 guns.</NOTE>; we mu&s;t entertain a very contemptible idea of the
Engli&s;h navy, com|pared to the force which it has now attained. In the year
1588, there were not above five ve&s;&s;els, equipped by the noblemen and
&s;ea-ports, which exceeded two hundred tons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 300.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN 1599, an alarm was given of an inva&s;ion from the Spaniards;
and the Queen equipped a fleet and levied an army in a fortnight to oppo&s;e
them. Nothing gave foreigners a higher idea of the power of England than this
&s;udden arma|ment. In 1575, all the militia in the kingdom were computed at an
hundred and eighty-two thou&s;and nine hundred and twenty-nine<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ives of

hundred and forty thou&s;and men, be&s;ides tho&s;e which Wales could
&s;upply<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p. 221.</NOTE>.
The&s;e armies were formidable by their numbers; but their di&s;cipline and
experience were not proportioned. Small bodies from Dun|kirk and Newport
frequently ran over, and plundered the ea&s;t coa&s;t: So unfit was the
militia, as it was then con&s;tituted, for the defence of the kingdom. The lord
lieutenants were fir&s;t appointed to the counties in this reign.</P>
<P>MR. MURDEN<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">p. 608.</NOTE> has
publi&s;hed a paper, which contains the military force of the nation at the
time of the Spani&s;h Armada, and which is &s;omewhat different from the
account given by our ordinary hi&s;torians. It makes the whole able|bodied men
of the kingdom amount to an hundred and eleven thou&s;and five hun|dred and
thirteen; tho&s;e armed, to eighty thou&s;and eight hundred and &s;eventy-five;
of whom forty four thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty-&s;even were trained.
It mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e able-bodied men con&s;i&s;ted of &s;uch
only as were regi&s;tered, otherwi&s;e the &s;mall number is not to be

<P>THE &s;tate of the Engli&s;h manufactures was at this time very

computation is not indeed to be e&s;teemed an exact e&s;timate of their wealth.
In 1567, there were found on enquiry to be four thou&s;and eight hundred and
fifty-one &s;trangers of all nations in London: Of whom three thou|&s;and eight

England; and the commerce, as well as manufactures, <PB N="735" REF="340"> of
that kingdom was very much improved by them<NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 668.</NOTE>. It was then that Sir Thomas Gre&s;ham
built, at his own charge, the magnificent fabric of the Ex|change for the
reception of the merchants: The Queen vi&s;ited it, and gave it the appellation
of the Royal Exchange.</P>
<P>THERE were two attempts made in this reign to &s;ettle colonies
in America; one by Sir Humphry Gilbert in Newfoundland, another by Sir Walter
Raleigh in Virginia: But neither of the&s;e projects proved &s;ucce&s;sful. All
the&s;e noble &s;et|tlements were made in the following reigns. The current
money of the king|dom, in the end of this reign, is computed at four
millions<NOTE N="&Verbar;&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Lives of the Admirals, vol. I.

<P>THE nobility in this age &s;upported a great deal of the ancient
magnificence in their ho&s;pitality, and in the numbers of their retainers; and
the Queen found it prudent to retrench, by proclamation, their expences in this
la&s;t particular<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. Appen. p.

frequent vi&s;its &s;he paid her nobility, and the magnificent fea&s;ts which
&s;he received from them. The earl of Leice&s;ter gave her an entertainment in
Kenibworth ca&s;tle, which was extraor|dinary for expence and magnificence.
Among other particulars, we are told, that three hundred and &s;ixty-five
hog&s;heads of beer were drank at it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Biogr.

expence; and it contained arms for ten thou|&s;and men<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 394.</NOTE>. The earl of Derby had a family
con&s;i&s;ting of two hundred and forty &s;ervants<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 674.</NOTE>. Stowe remarks it as a &s;ingular proof of
beneficence in this no|bleman, that he was contented with his rent from his
tenants, and exacted not any extraordinary &s;ervices from them: A proof that
the ab&s;olute power of the &s;overeign, what was unavoidable, had very
generally countenanced the nobility in tyrannizing over the people. Burleigh,
tho' he was frugal, and had no pater|nal e&s;tate; kept a family con&s;i&s;ting
of an hundred &s;ervants<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 129.
Appen.</NOTE>. He had a &s;tanding table for gentlemen, and two other tables
for per&s;ons of meaner condition, which were always &s;erved alike, whether he
were in town or in the country. About his per&s;on he had people of great
di&s;tinction, in&s;omuch that he could reckon up twenty gentlemen retainers
who had each a thou&s;and pounds a year; and as many among his ordinary
&s;ervants, who were worth from a thou&s;and pounds to three, five, ten, and
twenty thou&s;and pounds<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Biogr. Brit. p.

that time very &s;mall, the mini&s;ters and courtiers found means, by employing
the exorbitant prerogative, to acquire much greater fortunes than it is
po&s;&s;ible for them at pre&s;ent to gain, from their larger &s;alaries, and
more limited authority.</P>
<P><PB N="736" REF="341"> BUT tho' there were pre&s;erved great

was very little conformable to her edicts. As no woman was ever more conceited

more the variety and richne&s;s of her dre&s;s. She appeared almo&s;t every day
in a different habit; and tried all the &s;everal modes, by which &s;he hoped

<P>THE retrenchment of the ancient ho&s;pitality, and the
diminution of retainers, were favourable to the prerogative of the &s;overeign;
and by di&s;abling the great noblemen from re&s;i&s;tance, promoted the
execution of the laws, and extended the authority of the courts of ju&s;tice.
There were many particular cau&s;es in the &s;itua|tion and character of Henry
the &s;eventh, which augmented the authority of the crown: Mo&s;t of the&s;e
cau&s;es concurred in &s;ucceeding princes; together with the factions of
religion, and the acqui&s;ition of the &s;upremacy, a mo&s;t important ar|ticle
of prerogative: But the manners of the age were a general cau&s;e, which
operated during this whole period, and which continually tended to dimini&s;h
the riches, and &s;till more the influence of the Ari&s;tocracy, anciently &s;o
formidable to the crown. The habits of luxury di&s;&s;ipated the immen&s;e
fortunes of the anci|ent barons; and as the new methods of expence gave
&s;ub&s;i&s;tance to mechanics and merchants, who lived in an independant
manner on the fruits of their own indu&s;try, a nobleman, in&s;tead of that
unlimited a&s;cendant which he was wont to a&s;&s;ume over tho&s;e who were
maintained at his board, or &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by &s;alaries con|ferred on them,
retained only that moderate influence which cu&s;tomers have over 
<PB N="737" REF="342"> trade&s;men, and which can never be dangerous to civil
government. The land|proprietors al&s;o, having a greater demand for money than
for men, endeavoured to turn their lands to the be&s;t account with regard to
profit, and either inclo&s;ing their fields, or joining many &s;mall farms into
a few large ones, di&s;charged tho&s;e u&s;ele&s;s hands which formerly were
always at their call, in every attempt to &s;ubvert the government, or oppo&s;e
a neighbouring baron. By all the&s;e means the cities increa&s;ed; the middle
rank of men began to be rich and powerful; the prince, who, in effect, was the
&s;ame with the law, was implicitly obeyed; and tho' the farther progre&s;s of
the &s;ame cau&s;es begot a new plan of liberty, founded on the privileges of
the commons, yet in the interval between the fall of the nobles and the ri&s;e
of this order, the &s;overeign took advantage of the pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and
a&s;&s;umed an authority almo&s;t ab&s;olute.</P>
<P>WHATEVER may be commonly imagined, from the authority of lord
Bacon, and from that of Harrington, and later authors, the laws of Henry the
&s;eventh contributed very little towards the great revolutions which happened
about this period in the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. The practice of breaking
entails by a fine and recovery, had been introduced in the preceding reigns;
and this prince only gave indirectly a legal &s;anction to the practice, by
reforming &s;ome abu&s;es which attend|ed it. But the &s;ettled authority which
he acquired to the crown, enabled the &s;o|vereign to encroach on the
&s;eparate juri&s;dictions of the barons, and produced a more general and
regular execution of the laws. The counties palatine under|went the &s;ame fate
as the feudal juri&s;dictions; and by a &s;tatute of Henry the eighth<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Hon.
VIII. c. 21.</NOTE>, the juri&s;diction of the&s;e counties was annexed to the
crown, and all writs were ordained to run in the King's name. But the change of
manners was the chief cau&s;e of the &s;ecret revolution of the government, and
&s;ubverted the power of the barons.</P>
<P>LEARNING, on its fir&s;t revival, was held in great e&s;timation
by the Engli&s;h princes and nobles; and as it was not yet pro&s;tituted by
being too common, even the Great deemed it an object of ambition to attain a
character for literature. The four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;overeigns, Henry,
Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, may, on one account or other, be admitted into the
cla&s;s of authors. Queen Catherine Parr tran&s;lated a book: Lady Jane Gray,
con&s;idering her age, and her &s;ex, and her &s;tation, may be regarded as a
prodigy of literature. Sir Thomas Smith was rai&s;ed from being profe&s;&s;or
in Cambridge, fir&s;t to be amba&s;&s;ador to France, and then &s;ecretary of
&s;tate. The di&s;patches of tho&s;e times, and among others tho&s;e of 
<PB N="738" REF="343"> Burleigh him&s;elf, are very frequently interlarded with
quotations from the Greek and Latin cla&s;&s;ics. Even the ladies of the court
valued them&s;elves on knowlege: Lady Burleigh, lady Bacon, and their two
&s;i&s;ters, were mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of the ancient, as well as modern languages;
and valued them&s;elves more on their eurdition than on their rank and
quality.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth wrote and tran&s;lated &s;everal books; and
&s;he was familiarly acquainted with the Greek as well as Latin tongue. It is
pretended, that &s;he made an extemporary reply in Greek to the univer&s;ity of
Cambridge, who had addre&s;&s;ed her in that language. It is certain, that
&s;he an&s;wered in Latin, without prepa|ration, and in a very &s;pirited
manner, to the Poli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, who had been wanting in re&s;pect to
her. When &s;he had fini&s;hed, &s;he turned about to her courtiers, and
&s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"God's death, my lords," (for &s;he was much
addicted to &s;wearing) "I have been forced this day to &s;cour up my old
Latin, that hath long lain ru&s;ting<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Speed.</NOTE>."</Q> Elizabeth, even after &s;he was Queen, did not
entirely drop the ambition of appearing as an author; and next to her de&s;ire
of admiration for beauty, this &s;eems to have been the chief object of her
vanity. She tran|&s;lated Boethius of the Con&s;olation of Philo&s;ophy; in
order, as &s;he pretended, to allay her grief for Henry the fourth's change of
religion. As far as we can judge from Elizabeth's compo&s;itions, we may
pronounce, that notwith&s;tanding her application, and her excellent parts, her
ta&s;te in literature was very indiffer|ent: She was much inferior to her
&s;ucce&s;&s;or in this particular, who was him&s;elf far from being a ju&s;t
model of eloquence.</P>
<P>UNHAPPILY for literature, at lea&s;t for the learned of this
age, the Queen's va|nity lay more in &s;hining by her own learning, than in
encouraging men of genius by her liberality. Spencer him&s;elf, the fine&s;t
Engli&s;h writer of his age, was long neglected; and after the death of Sir
Philip Sydney, his patron, was allowed to die almo&s;t for want. This poet
contains great beauties, a &s;weet and harmonious ver&s;ification, ea&s;y
elocution, a fine imagination: Yet does the peru&s;al of his work become &s;o
tedious, that one never fini&s;hes it from the mere plea&s;ure which it
affords: It &s;oon becomes a kind of ta&s;k-reading; and it requires &s;ome
e&s;&s;ort and re&s;olution to carry us on to the end of his long performance.
This effect, of which every one is con&s;cious, is u&s;ually a&s;cribed to the
change of manners: But manners have more changed &s;ince Homer's age; and yet
that poet remains &s;till the favourite of every reader of ta&s;te and
judgment. Homer copied true natural manners, which, however rough or
uncultivated, will always form an agreeable and intere&s;ting picture: But the
pencil of the Engli&s;h poet was employed <PB N="739" REF="344"> in drawing the
affectations, and conceits, and fopperies of chivalry, which appear ridiculous
as &s;oon as they lo&s;e the recommendation of the mode. The tediou&s;ne&s;s of
continued allegory, and that too &s;eldom &s;triking or ingenious, has al&s;o
contri|buted to render the <HI>Fairy Queen</HI> peculiarly tire&s;ome; not to
mention the too great frequency of its de&s;criptions, and the langour of its
&s;tanza. Upon the whole, Spencer maintains his place in the &s;helves among
our Engli&s;h cla&s;&s;ics: But he is &s;eldom &s;een on the table; and
&s;carce any one, if he dares to be ingenuous, but will confe&s;s, that,
notwith&s;tanding all the merit of the poet, he affords an enter|tainment with
which the palate is &s;oon &s;atiated. Several writers of late have amu&s;ed
them&s;elves with copying the &s;tile of Spencer; and no imitation has been
&s;o indifferent as not to bear a great re&s;emblance of the original: His
manner is &s;o peculiar, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible not to transfer
&s;ome of it into the copy.</P>
