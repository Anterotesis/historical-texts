<HEAD>A VINDICATION OF THE AGE OF REASON, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MANY and virulent are the Replies which have appeared to Mr. Paine's <HI>Age of Rea&s;on.</HI> It was not, indeed, to be expected that a work of this de&s;cription, which &s;truck immediately at the very root of prie&s;t-craft, &s;hould remain long unan&s;wered. No &s;ooner was the challenge given, than a "whole ho&s;t of witne&s;&s;es" &s;tarted up in defence of that &s;y&s;tem, from whence (as Deme|trius in a &s;imilar ca&s;e ob&s;erved to his colleagues at Ephe&s;us) they derive their wealth. Men who had long been in the habit of fattening in luxurious ea&s;e upon the &s;poils and contributions of credulity, bigotry, and &s;uper&s;tition, were ju&s;tly apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t the inve&s;tigation of truth &s;hould at length open the eyes of the community at large, and di&s;cover in all its na|kedne&s;s the fallacy of that &s;y&s;tem, by virtue of
<PB N="6" REF="4">which they domineered over the &s;ouls and con|&s;ciences of mankind, and which "brought no &s;mall gain unto the craftsmen."</P>
<P>Hence the Age of Rea&s;on no &s;ooner made its appearance, than the <HI>too&s;in</HI> of alarm was &s;ounded throughout the whole Hierarchy. Re|ligion was now declared to be threatened with as great, and even greater dangers than tho&s;e which were &s;uppo&s;ed at a former period to me|nace the &s;tate, in con&s;equence of the publication of the <HI>Rights of Man.</HI> Every di&s;graceful epi|thet of abu&s;e was conferred with liberal hand upon the author: the titles of Dei&s;t, Athei&s;t, In|fidel, the Apo&s;tle of Beelzebub, the Agent of Lu|cifer, with an infinite variety of the like op|probrious terms, now &s;ucceeded to the appel|lations of Jacobin, Leveller, Anarchi&s;t, Revolu|tioni&s;t, Rebel, &amp;c. which had formerly been given to Mr. Paine on the &s;core of his politics. Not only the clergy of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, but the leading men of every religious &s;ect, had equal intere&s;t at &s;take, and were equally concerned in providing an antidote again&s;t the baneful influence of this deleterious poi&s;on: for the moment the way to God was laid open to every man alike; the moment neither <HI>ma&s;ters of the ceremonies,</HI> nor <HI>court etiquette</HI>&mdash;neither
<PB N="7" REF="5">prie&s;ts, nor religious forms&mdash;were nece&s;&s;ary to introduce man to his Maker; that moment, they readily fore&s;aw, mu&s;t inevitably put an end to their lucrative traffic, and totally anni|hilate the va&s;t revenues they received for acting as amba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t, and in&s;tilling into the minds of the people &s;piritual knowledge and heavenly comfort. Replies, An&s;wers, and Re|futations of the Age of Rea&s;on, and its <HI>diaboli|cal</HI> doctrines, were therefore publi&s;hed in abun|dance; many of which, however, by their futi|lity, and total want of argument, have produced the very rever&s;e of that effect, which their re&s;pective writers hoped to bring about; in|a&s;much as their incapacity to refute the doc|trines they attacked, &s;erved at once to &s;how their own imbecility, and the impregnable &s;trength of the fortre&s;s again&s;t which their puny efforts were directed.</P>
<P>It cannot be expected, nor indeed will the limits I have pre&s;cribed to the pre&s;ent work permit it, that I &s;hould enter into a minute, elaborate, examination of every petty Reply to which the Age of Rea&s;on has given birth. Their name may truly be denominated <HI>Legion,</HI> "for they are many;" and a &s;erious refutation of &s;ome of them is, perhaps, a moral impo&s;&s;ibility. The
<PB N="8" REF="6">wild, incomprehen&s;ible ravings of a Hunting|ton, and other my&s;tical writers, are beneath the dignity of Critici&s;m; and to cope with &s;uch men with the weapons of &s;ound argument and plain rea&s;on, would be, to adopt the language of their favourite Apo&s;tle, "fighting like one that beateth the air."</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons I &s;hall confine my &s;trictures chiefly to what I conceive the two mo&s;t re&s;|pectable publications that have appeared in our language on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject. The&s;e are&mdash;1. AN EXAMINATION OF THE AGE OF REASON, by Gilbert Wakefield; and, 2. AN ANSWER TO MR. PAINE'S AGE OF REASON, by the celebrated Dr. Prie&s;tley.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e gentlemen appear to agree nearly in their religious as well as in their political &s;entiments; and yet the manner in which they conduct their attack upon the Age of Rea&s;on furni&s;hes a &s;triking contra&s;t. Mr. Wakefield but too often indulges him&s;elf in a &s;pirit of acrimony, which, if not downright illiberality, borders, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, immediately upon it. He acknowledges, in the very out&s;et of his career, that <Q>the Work which he has under|taken to examine (&s;ee page 2) is entitled to particular re&s;pect, not only from the genius
<PB N="9" REF="7">of the Author, but al&s;o from the &s;ingular circum&s;tances of its compo&s;ition:</Q> but he &s;oon lo&s;es &s;ight of this re&s;pect, and de&s;cends to invective and abu&s;e
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pages 45, 51, 60, 61, 66. But I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to remark more largely upon this topic in the cour&s;e of the work.</NOTE>, which are quite un|worthy of the high literary reputation Mr. Wakefield de&s;ervedly enjoys. The field of literary di&s;pute, we apprehend, lies open to every man; but let him wield none but lawful weapons, even truth and &s;ound argument, and not turn the &s;acred <HI>Academic Grove</HI> into the &s;anguine <HI>Field of Mars!</HI></P>
<P>Another objection I have to the general cha|racter of Mr. Wakefield's Work, is the &s;trong vein of <HI>egoti&s;m</HI> which pervades many parts of it. Mr. Wakefield, contemplating him&s;elf as <Q>a delicate bird, delighting in &s;trawberries and the choice&s;t fruits,</Q> (&s;ee page 66) may bridle his neck, and &s;urvey with fond &s;elf-complacency his gay plumage&mdash;may hold in &s;overeign con|tempt Thomas Paine, and every other author, who, by differing from him in opinion, mani|fe&s;ts him&s;elf to be <Q>a crow, who prefers car|rion and putre&s;cence, and finds a fea&s;t in a
<PB N="10" REF="8">rotten carca&s;e;</Q> but &s;urely he might have mode&s;tly left his readers an opportunity of draw|ing this flattering compari&s;on in his favour.</P>
<P><HI>"Ad populum phaleras"</HI>&mdash;to imitate Mr. Wakefield's con&s;tant practice of introducing quotations from Latin and Greek authors on the mo&s;t trifling occa&s;ions
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In ju&s;tification of this remark, the reader is referred to the following pages of Mr. Wakefield's work, where he will find quotations heaped upon quotations, with all the pompo|&s;ity and affectation of a &s;chool-boy. See pages 2, 10, 13, 21, 22, 34, 42, 50, 51, 54, 59, 64, 66. In many of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages Greek and Latin authorities are brought forward in &s;upport of the mo&s;t palpable, the mo&s;t plain, trite, and (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) the mo&s;t every-day ob&s;ervations imaginable. I am far from objecting to cla&s;&s;ical quotations, introduced with judgment and with a &s;paring hand; but, when dealt out with extravagant profu&s;ion, when they &s;tare you in the face at every turn, where neither the &s;ubject nor the point|edne&s;s of the allu&s;ion, ju&s;tify their in&s;ertion, they certainly betray a pedantic di&s;po&s;ition, unworthy any gentleman of e&s;tabli&s;hed character in the republic of letters. And this re|mark I make the rather, as the general outcry rai&s;ed again&s;t Mr. Paine, on the &s;core of his being unver&s;ed in what are generally &s;tyled the learned languages, &s;eems to have led &s;everal of his opponents into this error; and I am convinced, that many an author has thereby acquired credit with unin|formed minds, for a greater portion of learning than he was ju&s;tly entitled to.</NOTE>; a practice which,
<PB N="11" REF="9">though it may &s;erve to impre&s;s the common cla&s;s of readers with a &s;tupendous idea of the Author's learning, has, in the eyes of men of &s;en&s;e, an air of pedantry, that more than any thing el&s;e has contributed to bring the name of &s;cholar into di&s;repute.</P>
<P>Quite the rever&s;e is Dr. Prie&s;tley's mode of proceeding in this literary warfare. He con|ducts him&s;elf with becoming dignity; argues in a fair, candid, and manly manner; never de&s;cends to per&s;onalities, but confines him&s;elf &s;trictly to the &s;ubject of di&s;pute, which he treats with great ingenuity, and at the &s;ame time with a plainne&s;s, which forms, as I before ob&s;erved, a &s;triking contra&s;t to the o&s;tentatious di&s;play of learning exhibited by Mr. Wake|field.</P>
<P>One ob&s;ervation more I mu&s;t beg leave to premi&s;e before I enter upon my intended <HI>Vin|dication of the Age of Rea&s;on</HI> in the aggregate; to wit, that I do not &s;et out (and I hope I &s;hall not fall into this error in the cour&s;e of my di&s;|qui&s;itions) with a predetermination to defend my author at all events, whether right or wrong; or to vindicate indi&s;criminately every po&s;i|tion laid down by Mr. Paine, becau&s;e I have once been induced to take up the cudgels in
<PB N="12" REF="10">his defence; or as though I deemed every a&s;|&s;ertion advanced by Mr. Paine infallible. On the contrary, I propo&s;e to treat the &s;ubject with due candour; and, much as I admire the general purport of the work under con&s;ideration, &s;hall readily &s;ub&s;cribe to the ju&s;tice and validity of any cen&s;ure be&s;towed upon particular pa&s;&s;ages, (and &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages I am well aware there are,) where hardy a&s;&s;ertion and &s;pecious &s;ophi&s;try &s;upply the place of &s;ound argument and know|ledge. It is not the per&s;onal cau&s;e of Mr. Paine, but the cau&s;e of what I conceive to be the Truth, that I wi&s;h to e&s;pou&s;e: from the free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and inve&s;tigation of which no con&s;ideration upon earth ought to deter a rational being. To inve&s;|tigate, and boldly avow, the Truth, as far as the mea&s;ure of rea&s;on wherewith we are endowed by the all-wi&s;e Author of Nature enables us to a&s;certain it, is a duty which man owes both to him&s;elf, and to &s;ociety at large; and whoever &s;hrinks back from the ta&s;k, whoever neglects to di&s;charge this part of his moral obligations, is either a <HI>traitor</HI> or a <HI>coward.</HI></P>
<P>I proceed now to an examination of the work I have undertaken to defend.</P>
<P>After briefly &s;tating the rea&s;on which induced him to anticipate the time he had originally pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="13" REF="11">to him&s;elf for the publication of his reli|gious &s;entiments, Mr. Paine proceeds to a &s;um|mary recapitulation, or confe&s;&s;ion of his creed. This may be &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of two parts&mdash;the one po&s;itive; the other negative. To the former part the &s;taunche&s;t advocate of Chri&s;tianity, I apprehend, cannot have the &s;malle&s;t objection to make: it accords with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enets of every religious denomination in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ent Chri&s;tian world that has come within my knowledge: it profe&s;&s;es a belief in one God; a hope of hap|pine&s;s beyond this life; inculcates the natural equality of man, which, in the &s;en&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re im|plied, the proude&s;t up&s;tart of ari&s;tocra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> will not, I flatter my&s;elf, take upon him to deny; and concludes with a definition of religious du|ties, which may be con&s;idered as a conci&s;e, but energetic comment upon the golden rule, <Q>Do unto others as ye would that others &s;hould do unto you.</Q></P>
<P>With the &s;econd or negative part, the ca&s;e is widely different. Here Mr. Paine attacks, with one bold deci&s;ive blow, the whole order of Prie&s;thood, of every religious &s;y&s;tem, from the times of Mo&s;es to the pre&s;ent day; and not only the Prie&s;thood, but the followers and di&s;|ciples of every religion and &s;ect, that does, or
<PB N="14" REF="12">ever did exi&s;t in the whole world. His words are the&s;e:</P>
<P><Q>I do not believe in the creed profe&s;&s;ed by the Jewi&s;h church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turki&s;h church, by the Prote&s;tant church, nor by any other church that I know of&mdash;My own mind is my own church.</Q></P>
<P><Q>All national in&s;titutions of churches, whe|ther Jewi&s;h, Chri&s;tian, or Turki&s;h, appear to me no other than human inventions, &s;et up to terrify and en&s;lave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.</Q></P>
<P>This may be con&s;idered as a general chal|lenge to the zealous &s;ticklers of every church e&s;tabli&s;hment. From &s;uch, therefore, we mu&s;t not look for a ready a&s;&s;ent to this part of our Author's creed. The doctrines of faith, what|ever the religion may be in which we are edu|cated, whether the Jewi&s;h, Chri&s;tian, Turki&s;h, or Pagan &s;y&s;tems, forming, generally &s;peaking, the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on in&s;tilled into the infant mind, at a time when the rea&s;oning faculties may be almo&s;t &s;aid to lie dormant, naturally make a deep im|pre&s;&s;ion; and, being familiari&s;ed to us by con|&s;tant repetition, we adopt them without exami|nation; we receive them upon tru&s;t; &s;ub&s;cribe to them as a matter of cour&s;e; and if, after|wards,
<PB N="15" REF="13">as we advance in years, and our rea&s;on attains to its proper growth, we are led to weigh, to prove, and examine, the religion we profe&s;s, which, by the bye, is not done, upon a very moderate calculation, by one in ten thou|&s;and, we have unfortunately, exclu&s;ive of the ta&s;k, the arduous ta&s;k, of &s;eparating Truth from Error, a powerful ho&s;t of prejudices and a&s;&s;ump|tions to combat with. For my own part, I am free to confe&s;s, that this blind acquie&s;cence in the opinions of others, this ea&s;y indifference with which mankind in general &s;it down con|tented with the religion of their ance&s;tors, whether Jews, Chri&s;tians, Turks, or Pagans, furni&s;hes, in my mind, no mean argument again&s;t the truth of any of them; or, in other words, again&s;t their divine origin. A religion, profe&s;&s;ing to be derived immediately from the Almighty, and written by divine in&s;piration, ought to fla&s;h conviction in the face of every one who hears or reads it. But this we do not find to be the ca&s;e with any known religion in the world. Add to this, that I do not &s;ee, that peace, morals, &s;ocial order, and the rights of humanity, are better re&s;pected and maintained under governments profe&s;&s;ing the Chri&s;tian faith, than where the blinde&s;t Idolatry prevails.
<PB N="16" REF="14">Nay, I am bold to a&s;&s;ert, that the remote and Pagan empire of Japan, might, in this re&s;pect, furni&s;h a pattern for the mo&s;t enlightened and religious &s;tate (if a <HI>religious</HI> &s;tate there be) in Chri&s;tendom
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See &s;ome excellent remarks upon this &s;ubject, in the fourth Volume of the Chevalier Thunberg's Travels, pub|li&s;hed this year by Me&s;&s;rs. Rivingtons, of St. Paul's Church|yard.</NOTE>. But this is a topic which I pro|po&s;e to di&s;cu&s;s more fully when I come to treat of the intimate connexion between religion and morals; on which occa&s;ion I &s;hall not omit to &s;ay a few words on the &s;tale, but ju&s;t maxim, as Mr. Wakefield very properly terms it, and which he accu&s;es Mr. Paine of having mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly violated&mdash;<Q><HI>ab abu&s;u ad u&s;um non valet con&s;equentia.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Meanwhile, I cannot but remark upon the ready acquie&s;cence with which Mr. Wakefield &s;ub&s;cribes to every part of our Author's creed, that makes in favour, and I might emphatically add, <HI>as far</HI> too as it makes in favour, of his own political creed.</P>
<P>"All national in&s;titutions of churches," writes Mr. Paine,&mdash;<Q>whether Jewi&s;h, Chri&s;|tian,
<PB N="17" REF="15">or Turki&s;h, appear to me no other than human inventions, &s;et up to terrify and en&s;lave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.</Q></P>
<P>How eagerly does Mr. Wakefield, who probably, in con&s;equence of his unfortunate &s;chi&s;m from the doctrines of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church of England, &s;ees no pro&s;pect of ob|taining the <HI>mitre,</HI> &s;ub&s;cribe his <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>Amen,</HI> to this ju&s;t remark <Q>conci&s;ely and pregnantly expre&s;&s;ed!</Q> He immediately becomes more violent in his reprobation than our Author him&s;elf; and launches out into a general in|vective again&s;t <HI>national churches,</HI> without the &s;malle&s;t di&s;crimination or exception.</P>
<P><Q><HI>National Churches</HI> (&s;ee page 10) are that <HI>hay</HI> and <HI>&s;tubble,</HI> which might be removed without any difficulty or even danger of con|fu&s;ion (this <HI>ip&s;e dixit</HI> a&s;&s;ertion of Mr. Wake|field, by the bye, will, I fear, by the venerable bench of bi&s;hops be pronounced equally <HI>hardy</HI> with any with which he taxes Mr. Paine
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 37 of Mr. Wakefield's Work.</NOTE>)</Q> <Q>from the fabric of religion by the gentle hand of Reformation, but which the infa|tuation of <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tics</HI> will leave to be de|&s;troyed
<PB N="18" REF="16"><HI>by fire. National Churches</HI> are that impure incru&s;tation, which has envelloped, by gradual concretion, the diamond of <HI>Chri&s;|tianity;</HI> nor can, I fear, for the rea&s;on ju&s;t now &s;tated, the genuine lu&s;tre be recovered, but by &s;uch violent effort of re&s;titution, as the &s;eparation of &s;ub&s;tances, &s;o long and clo&s;ely connected, mu&s;t inevitably require.</Q></P>
<P>The happy &s;imile of <HI>hay</HI> and <HI>&s;tubble</HI> in this beautiful conglomeration of metaphors we find is taken from the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle of Paul to the Corinthians, where the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of a build|ing to be rai&s;ed; and from his boa&s;t of having him&s;elf wrought, as a wi&s;e <HI>ma&s;ter-builder,</HI> upon the foundation, it &s;hould &s;eem that the erection of this building was a work of u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity. Now, if the words of the apo&s;tle have any re|ference at all to <HI>national e&s;tabli&s;hments,</HI> we ap|prehend, that the <HI>hay</HI> and <HI>&s;tubble</HI> mu&s;t apply to corrupt e&s;tabli&s;hments that will not &s;tand the te&s;t; &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as the Church of Rome, in the eyes of the Prote&s;tant clergy, and which therefore are threatened with de&s;truction by <HI>fire;</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>gold,</HI> the <HI>&s;ilver,</HI> and the <HI>precious &s;tones,</HI> (as for the <HI>wood,</HI> I do not in&s;i&s;t upon that, but will give it to Mr. Wakefield, to &s;hare the fate of his <HI>hay</HI> and <HI>&s;tubble</HI>) by a parallel chain of rea|&s;oning
<PB N="19" REF="17">may be &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;ignate and point out a pure, uncorrupted e&s;tabli&s;hment, cleared from the errors and &s;uper&s;titions of the Church of Rome, &s;uch as our divines pronounce the pre|&s;ent national Church of England to be. And as by the <HI>fire,</HI> which, the apo&s;tle tells us, is doomed to try every man's work, the awful phaenomena and awards of the day of judgment are generally under&s;tood to be meant, in which day the <Q>ele|ments &s;hall melt with fervent heat, the earth al&s;o, and the works that are therein, (of cour&s;e the <HI>hay</HI> and the <HI>&s;tubble</HI>) &s;hall be burnt up
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. iii. v. 10.</NOTE>,</Q> we are very &s;orry to think that Mr. Wakefield has no nearer pro&s;pect of getting rid of this &s;elf-&s;ame worthle&s;s <HI>hay</HI> and <HI>&s;tubble,</HI> and &s;ub|&s;tituting his <HI>gold</HI> and <HI>&s;ilver</HI> and <HI>precious &s;tones</HI> in their &s;tead, than at the very moment when the end of all things &s;hall take place.</P>
<P>Were I as ready to lay hold of every oppor|tunity of finding fault with Mr. Wakefield's expre&s;&s;ions, as this gentleman appears to be in the ca&s;e of Mr. Paine, I might po&s;&s;ibly di&s;|cover a <HI>flaw</HI> in his <HI>Diamond of Chri&s;tianity,</HI> which, to quote his own words, <Q>the impure incru&s;tation of <HI>National Churches</HI> has, by gradual concretion, enveloped to that de|gree,
<PB N="20" REF="18">that the genuine lu&s;tre cannot (he fears) be recovered, but by &s;uch violent effort of re&s;titution, as the &s;eparation of &s;ub&s;tances, &s;o long and clo&s;ely connected, mu&s;t inevitably require.</Q></P>
<P>Now, if we compare the religion founded by Chri&s;t to a Diamond (and I take it for granted that every &s;incere believer and profe&s;&s;or of it mu&s;t regard it in this light as a jewel of the fir&s;t water, as <Q>the pearl of great price, more precious than the golden wedge of Ophir</Q>) it &s;eems no more than fair to conclude, that this Diamond was not put into our hands by the Almighty in its rough incru&s;ted &s;tate, for man to cut and hack at plea&s;ure (&s;uch an idea would indeed fall little &s;hort of bla&s;phemy), but rather in a &s;tate of the utmo&s;t purity, po|li&s;hed to the highe&s;t degree of perfection, and, like the God from whom it profe&s;&s;es to origi|nate, without &s;pot or blemi&s;h.

<P>It is at this pa&s;&s;age, that Mr. Wakefield may be &s;aid to commence his attack upon our author.
<PB N="28" REF="26">Hitherto we have beheld him &s;ub&s;cribing with the readie&s;t acquie&s;cence to every po&s;ition advanced by Mr. Paine: but he now takes up the cudgels with a vengeance, and boldly de|clares Mr. Paine's &s;tatement to be <Q>not only vague and frivolous, but non&s;en&s;ical and erroneous in the extreme.</Q></P>
<P>In &s;upport of this a&s;&s;ertion, Mr. Wakefield pre&s;ents us with a &s;pecies of argument, which I have not the &s;malle&s;t he&s;itation to pronounce infinitely more <Q>vague, and frivolous, and erroneous,</Q> than one half of the &s;tatements in Mr. Paine's book, which his antagoni&s;t, without any &s;how of rea&s;on, declares to be <Q>not only the <HI>e&s;&s;ence</HI> but the very <HI>quinte&s;&s;ence</HI> of all weakne&s;s and ab&s;urdity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The &s;y&s;tem of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, (Mr. Wake|field writes, page 14) proceeds upon the very &s;uppo&s;ition, here in&s;tituted as in direct contradiction to it, that the way to God <HI>is</HI> open to every man alike; which <HI>might</HI> be proved, as every body knows, by many pa&s;|&s;ages of mo&s;t explicit purport in the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> &s;criptures.</Q></P>

Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cen|&s;ure, therefore, if it have any weight at all, mu&s;t apply to the inference our author draws from this &s;tatement, that the very act of granting a divine mi&s;&s;ion to any favoured individual, or admitting &s;uch a mi&s;&s;ion to be granted, is in it&s;elf a plain, though tacit acknowledgment, that the way to God is <HI>not</HI> open to every man alike," but that we &s;tand in need of <HI>mediators, plenipotentiaries, advocates,</HI> and <HI>amba&s;&s;adors,</HI> to tran&s;act our bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and arrange preliminaries for us; and that God is really a con&s;uming fire, (Deut. iv. 24.

<P>"It is a contradiction in terms and ideas," (continues Mr. Paine) <Q>to call any thing a <HI>revelation,</HI> that comes to us at <HI>&s;econd hand,</HI> either verbally or in writing. Revelation is nece&s;&s;arily limited to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> communica|tion. After this, it is only an account of &s;omething which that per&s;on &s;ays was a revelation made to <HI>him:</HI> and though <HI>he</HI> may find him&s;elf obliged to believe it, it cannot be incumbent on <HI>me</HI> to believe it in the &s;ame manner; for it was no revelation made to <HI>me;</HI> and I have only <HI>his word</HI> for it that it was made to <HI>him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e, together with Mr. Paine's former remarks on the &s;ubject of <HI>Revelation,</HI> in the <HI>religious</HI> acceptation of the <HI>word,</HI> appear to me to contain &s;uch a clear, ju&s;t, and ma&s;terly defi|nition
<PB N="39" REF="37">of the term, that, had I not po&s;itive evi|dence to the contrary before my eyes, I &s;hould hardly believe it po&s;&s;ible for any man to di&s;&s;ent from him. And yet we find, that this, as little as other pa&s;&s;ages of Mr. Paine's book, can e&s;|cape cen&s;ure, and even mi&s;repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>Dr. Prie&s;tly, after pronouncing his argu|ments to be <Q><HI>truly curious,</HI> and as he believes <HI>quite original,</HI></Q> (&s;ee page 44.) gives us a very unfair and partial &s;tatement of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>On this principle, it is not incumbent on Mr. Paine to believe what any per&s;on may tell him, and he may give credit to nothing but what he &s;ees him&s;elf; in which ca&s;e his faith will be reduced to a very &s;mall com|pa&s;s indeed. His pretence to a <HI>contradiction in terms</HI> is a mere quibble. We do not &s;ay, that the revelation made immediately to Mo&s;es or to Chri&s;t is &s;trictly &s;peaking a reve|lation to <HI>us;</HI> but if we &s;ee &s;ufficient rea&s;on to believe that the revelation <HI>was</HI> made to <HI>them,</HI> are, properly &s;peaking, believers in revela|tion; and if the revelation, whatever it be, relate to the whole human race, as well as to the per&s;on to whom it was immediately made, all mankind, Mr. Paine him&s;elf in|cluded,
<PB N="40" REF="38">will find them&s;elves under an equal <HI>obligation</HI> to re&s;pect it.</Q></P>
<P>In this exemplification the Doctor allows him&s;elf a greater latitude of con&s;truction than we conceive our&s;elves bound to concede to him. Had Mr. Paine, in &s;tating his own individual rejection of revelation, attached any degree of blame to tho&s;e of an oppo&s;ite opinion, he would have been guilty of uncharitablene&s;s and in|ju&s;tice, by u&s;urping that controul over the opinion of others, which he very properly re|fu&s;es to &s;ubmit to him&s;elf. But this is far from being the ca&s;e; Mr. Paine does not be|tray the remote&s;t di&s;po&s;ition or de&s;ire to aim at &s;uch de&s;potic &s;way over the &s;ouls and con|&s;ciences of men
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>I do not mean (writes our author, page 2) to condemn tho&s;e who believe otherwi&s;e. They have the &s;ame right to <HI>their</HI> belief, as I have to <HI>mine.</HI></Q></NOTE>. He contents him&s;elf with a&s;&s;igning his rea&s;ons for not believing certain recorded facts and tenets, without in&s;inuating the &s;lighte&s;t degree of cen&s;ure again&s;t tho&s;e who, viewing things in a different light, deem them&s;elves bound to place implicit faith and confidence therein. He very mode&s;tly &s;ays: <Q>I did not <HI>&s;ee</HI> the angel, and therefore I have a <HI>right</HI> not to believe his appearance. The
<PB N="41" REF="39">revelation was not made to <HI>me,</HI> and there|fore it cannot be <HI>incumbent</HI> upon <HI>me</HI> to be|lieve it.</Q> And, &s;peaking of mankind in ge|neral, he does not &s;ay, <Q>they <HI>act wrong</HI> in believing it,</Q> but merely, <Q>they are not <HI>obliged</HI> to believe it.</Q></P>
<P>As the liberty of thought is not, and indeed, <HI>cannot be,</HI> obnoxious to that re&s;traint which arbitrary power frequently impo&s;es upon our words and actions, every man, we apprehend, has a right to the mo&s;t unlimited freedom of opinion in his own individual capacity. It is, indeed, his birth-right, and perhaps of all his ju&s;t and numerous rights, the only one which the lawle&s;s hand of de&s;poti&s;m cannot invade. On this principle, therefore, in&s;tead of deem|ing Dr. Prie&s;tley's &s;tatement of the ca&s;e any argument again&s;t the ju&s;tice of Mr. Paine's remarks, we are clearly of opinion, <Q>that it is <HI>not</HI> incumbent on Mr. Paine, nor upon any other man, to believe what any per&s;on may tell him,</Q> if he has, or conceives him|&s;elf to have, good and grounded rea&s;on for withholding his faith. And, though by refu&s;ing to credit any tran&s;action which he does not &s;ee with his own eyes (here the Doctor, by the bye, carries his propo&s;ition to a much

<PB N="49" REF="47">on record in the &s;criptures in favour of the <HI>Godhead</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The two fir&s;t chapters of the Go&s;pel of St. Matthew are peremptorily rejected, becau&s;e there is no po&s;&s;ibility of <HI>&s;oftening down</HI> their evidence, which makes immediately again&s;t the Uni|tarian &s;y&s;tem: The &s;ame fate, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, is awarded again&s;t the two fir&s;t chap|ters of the Go&s;pel of St. Luke, and thus they hope at once to get over a difficulty which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e prove an in&s;urmountable &s;tumbling-block and rock of offence in their way.

The miraculous birth of Chri&s;t does not depend upon the &s;ingle te&s;timony of St. Matthew, or St. Luke, as its only vouchers; it &s;tands plainly predicted (I am arguing on the principle of a belief in revelation) in the prophecies of I&s;aiah, where it is expre&s;sly &s;aid, and men|tioned emphatically as a <HI>&s;ign</HI> or <HI>miracle,</HI> a <HI>&s;ign</HI> which the Lord him&s;elf &s;hould give after it had been &s;ubmitted to Ahab, to a&s;k a <HI>&s;ign</HI> of the Lord God, either in the depth be|neath, or in the height above: <Q>Behold,

<P>It would be endle&s;s to animadvert upon all the ab&s;urdities and incon&s;i&s;tencies to which a <HI>partial</HI> belief in the word of God, as the Scrip|tures are &s;tyled, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily and invari|ably lead.

To this demand I make an&s;wer, that as the Unitarian Creed appears to ad|mit of much greater latitude of con&s;truction, together with an almo&s;t unlimited freedom of rejection, with re&s;pect to whatever mili|tates again&s;t its own &s;y&s;tem in the Scriptures, I conceived that any conviction brought home again&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors and advocates of <HI>this faith,</HI> mu&s;t infallibly carry with it double

Rea&s;oning upon the very &s;ame principle, I will ea&s;ily prove <Q>that mon&s;trous farrago of ab&s;urdities and con|tradictions, concentrated, with mo&s;t in|genious and comprehen&s;ive brevity in the <HI>creeds</HI> denominated the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Nicene,</HI></Q> and which is &s;o tough of dige&s;t|ion to Mr. Wakefield's &s;tomach; all this I will ea&s;ily prove to be the <Q><HI>Truth as it is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI></Q> (Ephe&s;. iv. 21) ina&s;much as many thou&s;ands of &s;incere profe&s;&s;ors, and among the&s;e <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> them&s;elves, have &s;uffered the mo&s;t cruel and ignominious death, rather than renounce their faith in the&s;e creeds.

<PB N="61" REF="59">&s;tubborn pertinacity with which men adhere to their opinion.</P>
<P>But by far the weake&s;t place in Mr. Wake|field's defence of the re&s;urrection is the fol|lowing pa&s;&s;age, in which he attempts to invalidate the force of the objections rai&s;ed by Mr. Paine, on the plea of this miracle not being accompanied with that degree of publicity, which the nature of the ca&s;e &s;o well admitted of, and which the magnitude of the fact, if true, demanded.</P>
<P><Q>The re&s;urrection of a dead per&s;on from the grave, (writes Mr. Paine) and his a&s;|cen&s;ion through the air, is a thing very dif|ferent, as to the evidence it admits of, from the invi&s;ible conception of a child in the womb. The re&s;urrection and a&s;cen|&s;ion, &s;uppo&s;ing them to have taken place, admitted of public and ocular demon&s;tra|tion, like that of the a&s;cen&s;ion of a balloon, or the &s;un at noon-day to all Jeru&s;alem at lea&s;t. A thing, which every body is re|quired to believe, requires that the proof and evidence of it &s;hould be equal to all, and univer&s;al: and as the public vi&s;ibility of this la&s;t related act was the only evi|dence that could give &s;anction to the for|mer
<PB N="62" REF="60">part, the whole of it falls to the ground, becau&s;e that evidence never was given. In&s;tead of this, a &s;mall number of per&s;ons, not more than
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here Mr. Paine, as his antagoni&s;t ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, has fallen into an error, with re&s;pect to the number of per&s;ons &s;aid to have been witne&s;&s;es of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion. The &s;trength of the argument, however, &s;u&s;tains no detriment by it; and furthermore it mu&s;t be remembered, that our author is refuted only by the &s;in|gle evidence of Paul, (1 Cor. xv. 6.) and that only in one &s;olitary in&s;tance; and who knows but this pa&s;&s;age, only that it makes again&s;t the <HI>Author of the Age of Rea&s;on,</HI> might have been one of Mr. Wakefield's <HI>occa&s;ional inter|polations?</HI> (see page 23.)</NOTE> eight or nine, are introduced, as proxies for the whole world, to &s;ay, they <HI>&s;aw</HI> it, and all the re&s;t of the world are called upon to believe it. But it appears that Thomas did not believe the re&s;urrection; and, as they &s;ay, would not believe, without having ocular and manual demon&s;tration him&s;elf. <HI>So neither will I:</HI> and the rea&s;on holds equally good for me, and every other per&s;on, as for Thomas.</Q></P>
<P>In this &s;tatement of our author, whatever Mr. Wakefield may affect to think or &s;ay to
<PB N="63" REF="61">the contrary, I di&s;cern nothing but ju&s;t and manly argument. It is an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule in the moral as well as phy&s;ical world, that the <HI>means &s;hould be adequate to the end,</HI> and it is upon this principle that Mr. Paine rea&s;ons in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. The re|&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, as I before ob&s;erved, forming the grand te&s;t of the truth of Chri&s;|tianity: to &s;ub&s;tantiate and blazon abroad the fact beyond the power of controver&s;y, becomes an object of the fir&s;t magnitude. As the belief required in it extends to all, Mr. Paine &s;tands ju&s;tified in requiring that the evidence of it &s;hould be accompanied with a competent degree of publicity. The nature of the fact admitted of &s;uch public demon&s;tration; the magnitude of the object demanded it; and yet&mdash;this public demon|&s;tration is withheld:&mdash;the only evidence, which would at once have rendered all the eternal wranglings &s;ince maintained upon the &s;ubject unnece&s;&s;ary; which would have com|pletely baffled all the alledged machinations of the enemies of Chri&s;t to &s;uppre&s;s the truth and invalidate its force; and which would have procured Chri&s;tianity a deci&s;ive triumph over &s;ceptici&s;m and infidelity; this
<PB N="64" REF="62">only full, &s;atisfactory, incontrovertible, irre|fragable evidence is not granted. And why not granted? Becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, its place in the eyes of Mr. Wakefield, is better &s;upplied by <Q>corroborating coincidencies, collateral cir|cum&s;tances, by probabilities of the highe&s;t kind, by indi&s;&s;oluble connexions,</Q> <HI>et hoc genus omne;</HI> all of which, by the bye, not|with&s;tanding the inconceivable magnitude of the object; notwith&s;tanding the incalcu|lable intere&s;t at &s;take, do not amount to the &s;ame degree of po&s;itive conviction, which impre&s;&s;es on the mind of the <HI>geometer</HI> the <Q>equality of the <HI>three angles</HI> of a <HI>triangle</HI> to <HI>two right angles.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 35 of Mr. Wakefield's work.</NOTE></P>
<P>We concede, indeed, to Mr. Wakefield, that in occurrences of common life the con|curring te&s;timony of credible and di&s;inter|e&s;ted witne&s;s may be con&s;idered as compe|tent evidence in matters of <HI>plain fact,</HI> which do not militate again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of things. Thus, for in&s;tance, to pur&s;ue Mr. Wakefield's own argument, when I fir&s;t heard of the a&s;cen&s;ion of <HI>Lunardi</HI> from
<PB N="65" REF="63">the Artillery ground, in a balloon, I felt my&s;elf no more di&s;po&s;ed to call in que&s;tion the truth of the report, (notwith&s;tanding, from the circum&s;tance of my being abroad at the time, I did not enjoy the advantage of being an eye-witne&s;s of the fact,) than Mr. Wake|field could po&s;&s;ibly do, who, we find, was pre&s;ent on that memorable occa&s;ion. But, had I been ignorant of the principle on which balloons are con&s;tructed; had I never heard or read of the properties of air; had the experiment been made in &s;ome remote, far di&s;tant part of the globe, before only a few &s;elect friends, and in only one or two &s;olitary in&s;tances, and never afterwards repeated or attempted; had this, I &s;ay, been the ca&s;e, and any one had told me, under &s;uch circum|&s;tances, that a man had been &s;een to a&s;cend to a prodigious height in the air, and to pur&s;ue his <HI>aerial</HI> excur&s;ion for a con&s;iderable number of miles with incredible velocity; in that ca&s;e, the faith of the relator of this marvellous account, &s;uppo&s;ing him to have been at the &s;ame time an eye-witne&s;s of the fact, would, I fancy, exceed mine by many an <HI>"evane&s;cent infinite&s;imal</HI> of efficacy."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 32 or Mr. Wakefield's work</NOTE>&mdash;And,

Be&s;ides, that exerci&s;e and agitation of our mental powers, which is invariably produced by the delays and dif|ficulties intervening propo&s;itions of this nature, and the attainment of moral cer|tainty, in a painful di&s;qui&s;ition of evidence and a long deduction of particulars, con|tribute e&s;&s;entially to the quickne&s;s, the clearne&s;s, the vigour and general &s;alubrity of our under&s;tandings; ju&s;t as the water

<P>"Trite! and little to the purpo&s;e!" ex|claims Dr. Prie&s;tley, in reply to the&s;e truly ingenious remarks. <Q>Frivolous! and un|worthy of a man of &s;en&s;e!</Q> cries Mr. Wakefield: and both our learned <HI>Polemics</HI> immediately launch out into a long &s;tring of declamation, which has hardly the &s;hadow of an argument to countenance it. In&s;tead of bearing in mind, that the Bible, as far as it profe&s;&s;es to be a <HI>lanthorn</HI> to our feet; a <HI>light</HI> unto our path; our <HI>law, coun&s;ellor,</HI> and <HI>guide,</HI> relates chiefly to <HI>matters of opinion,</HI> and to <HI>matters of faith,</HI> and that it therefore is the more liable to &s;uffer from the <HI>defects of tran&s;lations,</HI> the <HI>mi&s;takes</HI> of copyi&s;ts, and

<P>"The truths of Revelation," (writes Mr. Prie&s;tley, page 45) <Q>do not depend upon <HI>niceties</HI> of ideas.</Q> <Q>A few <HI>mi&s;takes</HI> of copy|i&s;ts and printers make no alteration in the <HI>general</HI> effect,</Q> &s;ays Mr. Wakefield.

<P>Few texts in the Bible, perhaps, are more frequently referred to by the <HI>orthodox Sons of the Church,</HI> to prove the <HI>divinity of Chri&s;t,</HI> than the following pa&s;&s;age from St. Paul's fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to Timothy: <Q>And, without controver&s;y, great is the my&s;tery of god|line&s;s; <HI>GOD</HI> was manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, ju&s;tified in the &s;pirit, &s;een of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on
<PB N="87" REF="85">in the world, received up into glory.</Q> (1 Tim. iii. 16.) Now would it be believed, and yet the fact is well a&s;certained, that the word <HI>God,</HI> in which the whole &s;tre&s;s of the &s;entence centres, is not to be met with in the original? Would it be believed, that the &s;ingular circum&s;tance of the middle &s;troke of the E, in <GAP DESC="foreign">, having &s;unk through the parchment, &s;o as to appear on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, &s;hould exactly occupy the centre of the <HI>omicron</HI> in the <HI>relative</HI> OC, which by that means being taken for a <GAP DESC="foreign">, cau&s;ed the word to pa&s;s for <GAP DESC="foreign">, which is the abreviation of <GAP DESC="foreign">? Would it be believed, that the <HI>Divinity of Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould re&s;t upon &s;uch a &s;lender foundation as this? And yet &s;uch is the actual &s;tate of the ca&s;e, as the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Wet&s;tenii Proleg. in N. T.</HI> page 54 et &s;qq. Edit. Halens.</NOTE> <HI>Alexandrine Codex</HI> plainly proves. Mr. Prie&s;tley, I hope, will no longer take upon him to deny, that the truths of Revelation may depend upon very <HI>great niceties!</HI></P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of gro&s;s error and mi&s;|take occurs in Mr. Wakefield's reply to our Author's &s;trictures on the hi&s;tory of the cre|ation.</P>

<P>With re&s;pect to our author's excellent ani|madver&s;ions on <HI>prophets</HI> and <HI>prophecy,</HI> it is a matter of very little con&s;equence, in my apprehen&s;ion, whether the term, taken in its <HI>&s;criptural</HI> u&s;e and acceptation, &s;ignify a <HI>poet,</HI> as Mr. Paine explains it, or a <HI>teacher,</HI> as Mr. Wakefield maintains. I am &s;atisfied that Mr. Paine's &s;trictures contain abun|dance of truth
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Ju&s;tice, however, requires that I &s;hould notice in this place two very palpable errors into which Mr. Paine has fallen, and which are very properly animadverted upon by Dr. Prie&s;tley, though they &s;eem to have e&s;caped the <HI>lynx-eyed</HI> critici&s;m of Mr. Wakefield. The fir&s;t of the&s;e errors refers to Mr. Paine's attempt to prove that the <HI>pro|phetical writings</HI> were written in <HI>poetical mea&s;ure,</HI> by quoting pa&s;&s;ages from the <HI>Engli&s;h ver&s;ion.</HI> The truth of the pro|po&s;ition it&s;elf, at lea&s;t with re&s;pect to a part, is not de&s;igned to be called in que&s;tion; but the argument upon which Mr. Paine grounds his proof is altogether nugatory and fallacious.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd in&s;tance, Mr. Paine lays him&s;elf &s;till more open to animadver&s;ion. His hypothe&s;is, that there mu&s;t be <HI>degrees</HI> in prophe&s;ying, becau&s;e the prophets are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the appellations of the <HI>greater</HI> and the <HI>minor,</HI> is really calculated to rai&s;e a &s;mile, as Mr. Prie&s;tley very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves; the term having no reference whatever to the <HI>quality,</HI> but only to the <HI>quantity</HI> of what the&s;e pro|phets wrote. In both ca&s;es Mr. Paine is <HI>vulnerable,</HI> and I cannot defend him.</P></NOTE>, and perhaps too much to go down <HI>palatably</HI> in this <HI>age of prophecy and
<PB N="95" REF="93">revelation.</HI> <Q>The axe (to quote our au|thor's own energetic language) &s;trikes im|mediately at the root;</Q> it attacks the very <HI>fundamentals</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, the <HI>te&s;|timony of Je&s;us being the &s;pirit of prophecy.</HI>&mdash;(Rev. xix. 10.)</P>
<P>Such being the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, it &s;hould &s;eem well worth our while to be&s;tow a little attention and enquiry upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>"The &s;uppo&s;ed prophet (writes our au|thor) <Q>was the &s;uppo&s;ed hi&s;torian of times to come; and if he happened, in &s;hooting with a <HI>long bow</HI> of a thou&s;and years, to
<PB N="96" REF="94">&s;trike within a thou&s;and miles of the mark, the ingenuity of po&s;terity could make it point-blank; and if he happened to be directly <HI>wrong,</HI> it was only to &s;uppo&s;e, as in the ca&s;e of Jonah and Nineveh, that God had repented him&s;elf, and changed his mind.</Q></P>
<P>Let us next examine Dr. Prie&s;tley's &s;tate|ment. <Q>Some parts of the book of <HI>Daniel,</HI> and al&s;o of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> are written in <HI>&s;uch a manner,</HI> that it is probable we &s;hall not under&s;tand them completely, till we can compare them with the events to which they corre&s;pond.</Q></P>
<P>Here then let me put the que&s;tion to Dr. Prie&s;tley&mdash;Of what &s;ervice can the&s;e pro|phecies be, allowing them even to merit the title, if they are &s;o <HI>ob&s;cure</HI> that they are not to be <HI>under&s;tood,</HI> till explained and eluci|dated by <HI>fulfilment?</HI> And as by the term <HI>prophecy,</HI> a prediction, we apprehend, is meant, of certain &s;pecified events to be veri|fied or accompli&s;hed at &s;ome future period; how are we to know that the writings in que&s;tion have <HI>any claim to the title,</HI> if they be &s;o <HI>darkly worded</HI> that we cannot even
<PB N="97" REF="95">a&s;certain <HI>what</HI> tran&s;actions or events they are predictive of? We may on this plea wait till the <HI>end of days,</HI> and &s;till honour them with the <HI>title of prophecies,</HI> in daily hopes of &s;ome event or other turning up, to which our ingenuity can make the&s;e <HI>luminous</HI> and <HI>univer&s;al</HI> predictions refer; for it &s;eems they are <HI>prophetical of the fir&s;t plau&s;ible event that &s;hall befal!</HI></P>
<P>But it &s;eems, the moment this <HI>fortunate and long expected chance</HI> turns up, <Q>it is very <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> we may <HI>then</HI> be &s;atisfied, that only <HI>He</HI> who can &s;ee the end from the beginning, could have de&s;cribed them, <HI>even in that ob&s;cure manner,</HI> &s;o long before.</Q> Good bye, then, to prophecy, if even the original Revealer of it can &s;carcely &s;ee his way through the <HI>dark</HI> him&s;elf!</P>
<P>Yet &s;till is our determined <HI>champion of the faith,</HI> (and it requires <HI>great faith,</HI> indeed, almo&s;t enough to remove mountains, to be|lieve on &s;uch weak, un&s;atisfactory grounds) &s;till is he not a whit ca&s;t down, nor di&s;com|fited! He continues:</P>
<P><Q>The <HI>rea&s;on</HI> of the ob&s;curity of <HI>tho&s;e par|ticular prophecies, concerning events which
<PB N="98" REF="96">are yet to come,</HI> is pretty obvious
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Obvious,</HI> indeed! for as the <HI>fortunate chance</HI> of an <HI>antitype</HI> to the&s;e <HI>my&s;tical allu&s;ions</HI> has not yet turned up, the believers in them are &s;till <HI>groping about in the dark,</HI> and, like the <HI>prie&s;ts of Baal,</HI> calling upon their God to know whether he be <HI>&s;leeping;</HI> or <HI>bu&s;ily engaged in granting audience to &s;ome of his newly-commi&s;&s;ioned delegates and pro|phets;</HI> or whether, peradventure, he is on a <HI>journey in que&s;t of fortunate chances, to verify his predictions, and render them intelligible,</HI> that he heareth not, nor yet &s;endeth <HI>one &s;park of fire, one ray of light,</HI> to enable them to <HI>&s;ee their way</HI> through the <HI>prophetical fog</HI> in which <HI>their &s;en&s;es are lo&s;t and bewildered!</HI></NOTE>. For as the&s;e prophecies are now in the hands of tho&s;e who re&s;pect them, it might have been &s;aid, that they contributed to their own fulfilment by the friends of revelation endeavouring &s;o bring about the events predicted.</Q></P>
<P>A curious mode of rea&s;oning, indeed! What a pity the&s;e prophecies were not writ|ten in <HI>hieroglyphics,</HI> in which ca&s;e they might, po&s;&s;ibly, have been <HI>more ob&s;cure</HI> and <HI>darker</HI> &s;till than they are in their pre&s;ent &s;tate!

<PB N="99" REF="97">having, from their clear apprehen&s;ion of them, contributed to their verification.</P>
<P>But not yet, even, is our doughty champion to be di&s;pirited. He has followed the ad|vice given by the &s;pirit to the <HI>angel of the church of Laodicea,</HI> (Rev. iii. 18.) and has wi&s;ely provided him&s;elf with <HI>eye &s;alve,</HI> that <HI>he may &s;ee,</HI> where others are fain to <HI>&s;hut their eyes,</HI> and give up all hopes of extricating them&s;elves.</P>

<P>Let us now turn our eye to the <HI>Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem:</HI></P>

<P>Nearly four thou&s;and years elap&s;e, man continuing all that time to &s;uffer the pu|ni&s;hment
<PB N="123" REF="121">of a guilt he had not incurred, when a Saviour is born in Bethlehem; whether by <HI>divine conception</HI> or not, is nothing to the pre&s;ent que&s;tion. This illu&s;trious per&s;onage is held up as the <HI>&s;cape goat</HI> of the whole human race, who is to expiate the guilt in|curred by the original tran&s;gre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e doctrines therefore proceed upon one and the &s;ame principle. The one damns all mankind for a <HI>guilt</HI> in which (one only pair excepted) they had no <HI>participa|tion;</HI> and the other profe&s;&s;es to &s;ave the&s;e wretched victims for the <HI>merit</HI> of another, in which they were equally <HI>neuter.</HI> Thus inju&s;tice forms the grand characteri&s;tic of them both.</P>
<P>The glaring ab&s;urdity, and, as I &s;aid be|fore, inju&s;tice, of this &s;cheme, are &s;o ably pointed out by Mr. Paine (who&s;e <HI>notion of Redemption</HI> I conceive to be a very ju&s;t one, though po&s;&s;ibly derived from his <HI>father</HI>'s

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here I am well aware of a whole ho&s;t of quibblers, that will not fail to fall foul upon me with their ridiculous di&s;tinction between <HI>natural</HI> death and <HI>&s;piritual</HI> death; but, to give them their fulle&s;t &s;wing, they mu&s;t allow that <HI>natural death,</HI> if it did not con&s;titute the <HI>whole</HI> of Adam's puni&s;hment, forms however, a <HI>part;</HI> and this conce&s;&s;ion granted (and grant it they <HI>mu&s;t</HI>) my argument holds equally good.</NOTE> <HI>death</HI> therefore was the puni&s;hment denounced again&s;t &s;in, it was impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>any</HI> Redemption to take place, after the puni&s;hment had once been actually inflicted. Unle&s;s, indeed, as &s;oon as the proxy-expiation was effected, tho&s;e who had already paid the forfeit, that is to &s;ay, all the per&s;ons who have died from Adam to Chri&s;t, had been re&s;tored to life; for, if I am arre&s;ted for a debt, and a friend is generous enough to di&s;charge it for me, I am no longer de|tained in pri&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="123">Again, allowing even the <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of Redemption; nay I will go a &s;tep further, and &s;uppo&s;e it to have <HI>actually taken place;</HI> &s;till I maintain, that <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> is not done to man by it. Adam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion damns me, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> without any act of mine. I have a right, therefore, when Redemption is held out to my view, to expect that I &s;hall benefit by it upon the <HI>&s;ame terms.</HI> I have a right to &s;tand <HI>neuter</HI> in the bu&s;ine&s;s; and as I am damned by <HI>Adam's Fall,</HI> whether I pro|fe&s;s to believe in it or not, I have a right to benefit by <HI>Chri&s;t's Redemption,</HI> whether I make it my creed of faith or not.

The &s;inner, who tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t any ordinance of the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation, not puni&s;hable with death was made to <HI>&s;mart</HI> for his crime, by the <HI>forfeit</HI> he had to pay under the name of an <HI>offering.</HI> Under the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation the mo&s;t damnable &s;ins (provided they do not offend again&s;t the &s;tatute) may be committed one moment, and repented of the next, and pardoned to boot, without co&s;ting the &s;inner one farthing, un|le&s;s he has the misfortune (for &s;uch I mu&s;t con&s;ider it in this light) to belong to the Ro|mi&s;h church; in which ca&s;e he will have to pay (but I believe the terms are pretty mo|derate) for ab&s;olution.</P>
<P>Whether he pays, however, or not; whe|ther he be a di&s;ciple of the Church of Rome, or a di&s;ciple of the church of England, it makes no difference as to his conduct. In the former ca&s;e, he can buy a licence to &s;in on with impunity, for three, or four, or a dozen years together, according as his pur&s;e

<P>The Chri&s;tians, long per&s;ecuted by the Jews and Pagans, no &s;ooner get out of the fire them&s;elves, than they begin to thru&s;t others into it. They retaliate upon the Jews, they retaliate upon the Pagans, and when they have no common enemies to per&s;ecute, they fall out among them&s;elves, and begin to worry each other. Their religion at length branches out into two di&s;tinct rami&s;ications; which is not to be wondered at, as I have already demon&s;trated Chri&s;tianity to be <HI>theo|retical;</HI> whereas Judai&s;m was <HI>practical.</HI> The&s;e two <HI>branches,</HI> though originating from the <HI>&s;ame &s;tem,</HI> harbour greater hatred to each other, than if they were <HI>rival trees.</HI> Per|&s;ecution rages hotter now than ever; the elder branch, being the mo&s;t powerful, as matured and invigorated by age, carries it awhile with a high and daring hand. At length the younger branch attains to &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="128" REF="126">growth and vigour to di&s;pute the day, and retaliates in its turn upon the elder branch. Thus they continue worrying each other, till their mutual intere&s;ts compel them to live more neighbourly together: but neither &s;hould a &s;ingle leaf on the Pro|te&s;tant branch enjoy one vi&s;it from the genial beams of the &s;un, if the Catholics could pre|vent it; nor the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ing be allowed to the leaves of the Catholic branch, if the Pro|te&s;tants had it in their power to ca&s;t a &s;hade upon them.
