<P>THIS Tract is part of a general E&s;&s;ay on the Change of the Repre&s;entation of the People, &s;o much agitated of late. The whole was de&s;igned, at fir&s;t, not to have been extended beyond the limits of a &s;hort pamphlet: but, as I advanced, I found that it would &s;o much exceed tho&s;e bounds, that the Publication mu&s;t have been delayed, until the chance of its utility (if it would have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any) would have been nearly lo&s;t. I have therefore con|&s;idered one great divi&s;ion of the &s;ubject only, retaining &s;o much of the general matter as may &s;erve for an intro|duction to it; and one purpo&s;e of this Adverti&s;ement is, to account for the appearance that this Tract carries, of be|ing a detached part only of a &s;ubject of con&s;iderable extent.</P>

<HEAD>THE ALTERATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>A MEASURE of &s;uch importance as an alteration of the con&s;titution of the Third E&s;tate, certainly re|quires to be examined in every point of view, before it be carried into execution. It may be con&s;idered as to its general or local con&s;equence: the fir&s;t as affecting the whole kingdom; the &s;econd, the larger di&s;trict of it.</P>
<P>It will affect the kingdom in general, by producing a change in the pre&s;ent proportion of power, in the executive and legi&s;lative departments of the State. For its advocates hold out, that it will dimini&s;h con|&s;iderably that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Crown, and at the &s;ame time reduce that of the Peers; while the &s;trength of the popular branch of the Legi&s;lature is to receive &s;ome con&s;iderable increa&s;e. It is not (that I know of) &s;o much as pretended, that the effective powers of the King, and the Hou&s;e of Lords, are to be de|crea&s;ed in the &s;ame proportion: it &s;eems on the con|trary, that the greater ce&s;&s;ion is to be demanded of the Crown. Hence the power of the Upper Hou&s;e will become relatively greater, compared with that of the Sovereign; and relatively much le&s;s, compared with
<PB N="2" REF="5">
the increa&s;ed power of the Commons; or a total change will take place, in the pre&s;ent proportion of power of the three E&s;tates.</P>
<P>The effect of this change upon the whole kingdom, taken as a whole, I do not intend at pre&s;ent to enter into; but to examine its con&s;equences to a particular di&s;trict of great magnitude and importance, the &s;outhern and ea&s;tern counties; and &s;olely with re&s;pect to the tax upon land.</P>
<P>This part of the kingdom comprehends the coun|ties of Middle&s;ex, Surry, Hertford, Bedford, Cam|bridge, Kent, E&s;&s;ex, Norfolk, Suffolk, Berks, Buck|ingham, and Oxford. With re&s;pect to the metropolis, the&s;e may be called the home di&s;trict or counties; and the remainder of England and Wales, the re|mote di&s;trict or divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>To the former of the&s;e di&s;tricts, I con&s;ider the pre|&s;ent propo&s;ed alteration of the con&s;titution of the Lower Hou&s;e, as a mea&s;ure attended with great danger: be|cau&s;e, as near as its termination is, it is not very pro|bable that the pre&s;ent century will elap&s;e, or at lea&s;t be long elap&s;ed, before the amount of the land-tax will be augmented: and though the repre&s;entatives of the landed property of the remote di&s;trict, have now a very con&s;iderable majority, over tho&s;e of the home counties in the Lower Hou&s;e; yet, by the mo&s;t &s;ober plans of this alteration which I have &s;een, it will in future be doubled. Now the burthen of the tax on the latter, is much greater than that on the former; and thus all relief to this great exi&s;ting di&s;proportion, will be rendered impo&s;&s;ible; the pre&s;ent a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment will be made the ba&s;is of the additions to the charges of this tax which mu&s;t in future take place: and the difference of the actual and proportional payment of the remote di&s;trict, already very great, will receive a further augmentation. Now (all con&s;ideration of the metropolis being con&s;tantly left out of the que&s;tion)
<PB N="3" REF="6">
the direct con&s;equence of this mu&s;t be, that the &s;upe|rior celerity with which the remote di&s;trict has been advancing in opulence, during the cour&s;e of the pre|&s;ent century (aided, be&s;ide its natural advantages, by the exi&s;ting inequality of the land-tax) will become greater by a &s;econd artificial acceleration, which will ari&s;e from this &s;econd defalcation of their payment to the public charge: and the relative decline of the home di&s;trict, will be precipitated in the &s;ame degree.</P>
<P>One con&s;equence of this may be here laid down: it directly follows from a &s;uppo&s;ition of its truth, that, if it &s;hould be granted that a change of con&s;ti|tution of the Hou&s;e of Commons is otherwi&s;e expe|dient (a &s;uppo&s;ition which, though not attacked here, is not to be taken as hereby admitted) &s;till it ought not to take place, until its dangerous con&s;equences be guarded again&s;t! which are, not only that of per|petuating an old &s;y&s;tem of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t inequality of the public burthens of the two divi&s;ions of the king|dom; but al&s;o that of aggravating its oppre&s;&s;ive di&s;|parity by new augmentations. This mu&s;t be guarded again&s;t, previous to intru&s;ting the remote counties with double their pre&s;ent majority of members in the Hou&s;e of Commons: until that be done, a pru|dential ju&s;tice, a regard for a fair equality, if the&s;e things have any exi&s;tence more than in name, demand the mea&s;ure to be po&s;tponed. And hence it follows, not only that the pre&s;ent is not the proper &s;ea&s;on to effect this alteration; but that &s;uch a period has not yet occurred &s;ince the Revolution; and that it is a happy circum&s;tance, that no attempt to carry it into execution has hitherto &s;ucceeded. This is the legi|timate con&s;equence of the argument, the &s;ummary of which is laid down above: its &s;everal branches are now to be entered into, particularly and &s;eparately.</P>
<P>But it has often been urged by the inhabitants of
<PB N="4" REF="7">
the remote di&s;trict, that the expediency and ju&s;tice of the continuation of the pre&s;ent a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, have been e&s;tabli&s;hed upon good and &s;olid rea&s;ons: and they may be inclined to alledge, <Q>that this argument ought to be treated as a dilatory plea only, again&s;t a nece&s;&s;ary reform: and that the bringing it for|ward at this juncture, points out the propriety of carrying this great con&s;titutional mea&s;ure into im|mediate execution, even for the quiet of the home divi&s;ion; who, when they &s;ee the ab&s;olute impo&s;|&s;ibility of &s;ucceeding in their unju&s;t and impolitic preten&s;ions, will &s;ilently abandon them: and the imaginary grievance, the real di&s;content it has al|ways fo&s;tered, and all their chimerical expectations, will &s;ink into oblivion together.</Q> As the gene|ral argument may thus be attempted to be an&s;wered; this objection, and the con&s;equences drawn from it, will be anticipated by treating the &s;ubject in the fol|lowing order.</P>

<PB N="5" REF="8">
by the remote di&s;trict, in the Lower Hou&s;e, will be proved. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e di&s;cu&s;&s;ions will nece&s;&s;arily lead to a variety of arith|metical operations: the data on which they are founded, the cir|cum&s;tances affecting their authority, and the proce&s;&s;es them&s;elves, will all be referred to the Appendix: the re&s;ults only of the&s;e operations will be noticed in each Section; to pre&s;erve the hi&s;tory or train of rea&s;oning in it, clear and uninterruped by arithmetical operations; which, however nece&s;&s;ary on the &s;ubject, produce nearly the &s;ame effect, mixed with arguments of the former kind, as digre&s;&s;ions to collateral, or even to foreign matter.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> On the Cau&s;e of the Inequality of the Land-Tax.</HEAD>
<P>THE origin of the di&s;proportion of the charge of the modern Land-tax upon the home and re|mote di&s;trict, is to be &s;ound in a very early period of our hi&s;tory; when the &s;outh-we&s;t counties were ex|po&s;ed to the de&s;cents of the French, and the we&s;tern and northern, to the predatory incur&s;ions of the Welch and Scotch. The&s;e ho&s;tilities expo&s;ed them to fre|quent and con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es; and they could con|tribute very little to the charge of the general defence, after they had provided for their own. Hence it appears, in the old accounts of the Exchequer, that the northern and we&s;tern counties were always fa|voured in their charge to the ancient &s;ub&s;idies. And during the reign of Mary the Fir&s;t, the whole counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, We&s;tmoreland, the towns of Berwick and Newca&s;tle, and the Bi&s;hop|ric of Durham, were exempted from the payment
<PB N="6" REF="9">
of the&s;e grants, on account of their vicinity to the Scotch. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sinclair, part 1. page 122.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the 17th and 18th of Charles the Fir&s;t an a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ment of &pound; 400,000 was levied upon Land, ac|cording to the proportion of the old &s;ub&s;idies<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Davenant, vol. 1. p. 48.</NOTE>. Du|ring the civil war, the Exci&s;e had been the great re|&s;ource of the Parliament: but when the royal party was &s;ubdued, a Land-tax by monthly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments was extended over the whole kingdom <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 34.</NOTE>; the pro|portions of the old &s;ub&s;idies were adhered to as be|fore<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 48.</NOTE>. It has been generally &s;aid, that, by the&s;e a&s;&s;e&s;|ments, the heavie&s;t charges fell upon &s;uch di&s;tricts as had formed a&s;&s;ociations in defence of Parliament: and this has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be the origin of the inequality of the modern Land-tax: but mo&s;t coun|ties in England having been at &s;ome time or other a&s;&s;ociated during the war, and by ordinances of the Lords and Commons at We&s;tmin&s;ter,<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 34.</NOTE> this &s;uppo|&s;ition mu&s;t be given up.</P>
<P>One cau&s;e of continuing the former proportions of this charge, was, that while the remote di&s;trict had been much harra&s;&s;ed by the ho&s;tile armies of both parties, the home counties, better covered by the forces of the Parliament, had enjoyed a greater de|gree of &s;ecurity. Hence aro&s;e a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome temporary indulgence to the former; which was very commodiou&s;ly, but perhaps not very politically con|ferred upon them, by continuing the old proportion of taxation.<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 34.</NOTE> This mode of rai&s;ing money by monthly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, formed part of the con&s;tant revenue of the State, until the Re&s;toration: the remote counties however were indebted for this indulgence, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to the number and vigilance of the mem|bers
<PB N="7" REF="10">
they returnd to the Hou&s;e, as well as to the con&s;ideration of their pa&s;t &s;ufferings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davenant, vol. 1. p. 34.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments were the ba&s;is, on which the payments of the &s;everal parts of the kingdom to the modern Land-tax were determined; and to which they are "exactly"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 48.</NOTE> proportioned. This fact, for which we have cotemporary te&s;timony, is in part the &s;ource of the popular error on this &s;ubject. Thus the di&s;proportion of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments of the common|wealth was the proximate, and that of the old &s;ub|&s;idies the remote, cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent inequality of the Land-tax.</P>
<P>The plan of converting the monthly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments upon land, into a pound rate, was fir&s;t brought for|ward in that &s;ingular Convention, which received the name of Prai&s;e-God Barebones Parliament. They re|&s;olved that the &s;upply for the maintenance of the army &s;hould be &s;o rai&s;ed; but the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment was broken up, before that re&s;olution received the form of an ordinance or law<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ludlow's Memoirs, vol. 2. p. 472. Vivay in Switzerland, 1698.</NOTE>. That this new &s;y&s;tem either was then, or afterwards became popular, is evident from its being carried into execution, the fir&s;t year after the Revolution; for new &s;chemes for rai&s;ing money, which had not acquired an antecedent popu|larity, would not at &s;uch a time have been embraced. Two &s;upplies by a tax on land were granted in that year; the fir&s;t at one &s;hilling, and the &s;econd at two &s;hillings, in the pound. Their aggregate produce was &pound;1,566,627: and at four &s;hillings in the pound, the &s;um collected would have been &pound;2,088,836. The real produce of the tax at that rate in the year 1693, was &pound;1,977,713<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Davenant, vol. 1. p. 278.</NOTE>. There appears therefore to have been a deficiency of &pound;111,123 in the latter payment, which is thus accounted for: to the fir&s;t, the inhabitants of the home di&s;trict had a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves
<PB N="8" REF="11">
more nearly to the true value of their e&s;tates: they afterwards "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davenant, vol. 1. p. 278.</NOTE>learned of their neighbours, to fa|vour them&s;elves in the levying of this tax." If any &s;pecies of fraud admitted of defence, it might be &s;aid, that they did not &s;ufficiently profit of the example they had before them.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of 1693 continues, with very little change, to be the &s;tandard of the pre&s;ent time: though a certain part of this reduced amount has been ren|dered only nominal, in a very &s;ingular manner, by the &s;ub&s;equent exten&s;ion of the tax to &s;alaries and fees of office; which was certainly intended to pro|duce an augmentation of the revenue: its effect has however been contrary; for the entire &s;alary is paid out of the Exchequer <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mole&s;worth, &s;ixth Report of Commi&s;&s;ioners, vol. 1. p. 115.</NOTE>; and the tax on each officer goes in aid of the &s;um, at which the place where he re&s;ides was before a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; a relief where probably it is not wanted. Thus this tax is in no ca&s;e an in|crea&s;e of the income of the public; and in &s;ome in&s;tances it actually dimini&s;hes it; for when the &s;a|lary is &s;mall, the officer is repaid out of the receipts of his own department<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sinclair, Part the third, p. 168.</NOTE>: thus the Trea&s;ury pays part of the tax of all tho&s;e places, where officers with &s;mall &s;alaries re&s;ide; and the neat revenue of the State becomes actually dimini&s;hed. What the lo&s;s thus generated may amount to, I am unable to a&s;&s;ign: the effective payment of every county will therefore be taken con&s;tantly to be the &s;ame as in the year 1693.</P>
<P>When this inequality originally took place, &s;everal rea&s;onings were made u&s;e of in defence of it, but of unequal validity. It was urged, that the owners of land in the remote di&s;trict, could not pay an equal &s;um in the pound out of their rents; <Q>becau&s;e their
<PB N="9" REF="12">
returns and markets were not &s;o quick; and they ta&s;ted not that benefit of trade and greatne&s;s of London, in the &s;ame degree as the home coun|ties.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davenant, vol. 1. p. 61.</NOTE></Q> It may very well be granted that, at the im|po&s;ition of the Land-tax, the production of a farm of 100 acres in the remote di&s;trict, &s;old for le&s;s money, than that of another of an equal &s;ize in the home divi&s;ion; in con&s;equence of which, the rent of the latter was greater then that of the former; and therefore that an equal tax could not equitably be impo&s;ed upon equal quantities of land in each: but it by no means follows, that from equal rents, equally well paid, (which is for the pre&s;ent to be &s;uppo&s;ed) equal &s;ums ought not to be contributed to the public charge; whatever the local circum&s;tances, or the na|tural properties of the &s;oil out of which they re&s;ult, may be. For there is the &s;ame rea&s;on to admit a deduction upon account of one of the&s;e accidents in|&s;eparably attached to the e&s;tate, as upon account of the other. The landlord who derives an income of &pound;.100 a year, from a farm with a good &s;oil, &s;ituated near an inferior market, is in the &s;ame circum&s;tances with re&s;pect to his ability to pay taxes, as another who receives the &s;ame rent from a farm, containing the &s;ame number of acres; who&s;e &s;oil is inferior, but which is &s;ituated in the vicinity of a good mar|ket: and if the latter were to plead for an abate|ment of a tax, confe&s;&s;edly proportioned to his in|come, becau&s;e it was derived from a tract of &s;andy country, we &s;hould &s;mile at &s;uch a plea, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But another argument was urged, at the time of the impo&s;ition of the land-tax, in defence of the ori|ginal di&s;proportion of the charge upon the two di|&s;tricts; which, if the fact it re&s;ts upon be admitted,
<PB N="10" REF="13">
proves beyond di&s;pute, that the remote di&s;trict &s;tood then in need of con&s;iderable relief in &s;ome &s;hape or other: and that fact is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the fulle&s;t evidence. The landlords of the remote di&s;trict al|ledged, that they <Q>were not able to pay the &s;ame pound rate, becau&s;e their rents were not &s;o well paid:</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davenant, vol. 1. p. 61.</NOTE> that is, lo&s;&s;es of rent were more common among them, than in the home divi&s;ion. Dave|nant, from whom this is extracted, when writing in favour of the equalization of the tax, gives this as part of the plea of the remote di&s;trict; and does not di&s;pute the fact. This tacit admi&s;&s;ion of it is a kind of hi&s;torical evidence in its favour. He al&s;o informs us, that in the year 1665 it was evident that money was &s;carce in the northern and we&s;tern counties;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davenant, vol. 1. p. 61.</NOTE> a circum&s;tance which mu&s;t have cau&s;ed many delays and failures, in the payment of rent; and it will be &s;een pre&s;ently, that the relative depre&s;&s;ion of the landed in|tere&s;t in tho&s;e parts of the kingdom, had increa&s;ed be|tween that time and the Revolution. That failures in the payment of rent were then frequent in the we&s;tern counties particularly, and that the farmers were in great di&s;tre&s;s there, &s;eems apparent from the te&s;ti|mony of Mr. Locke.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Locke, vol. 1. p. 13. Con&s;iderations on Intere&s;t. This e&s;&s;ay was written about the year 1672, and publi&s;hed in 1691; as appears from the letter prefixed to it: in the latter year it received &s;ome enlargements. The pa&s;&s;age relates to one of the two years; and in either ca&s;e, it is applicable to one of the two &s;tatements here given.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the&s;e accounts perhaps, without more &s;ub&s;tan|tial &s;upport, would not be &s;ufficient at this time ab&s;o|lutely to confirm the fact, on which the remote di|&s;trict then claimed the indulgence of the State: and we might be inclined to detract &s;omething from their credit, upon account of that degree of doubt, with which &s;uch complaints ought in general to be re|ceived:
<PB N="11" REF="14">
but it is proved from the price of e&s;tates in 1666, that the rents were then very badly paid in the remote di&s;trict: and on the &s;ame evidence it is to be &s;hown, that from that year the &s;ecurity of pay|ment to the landlord, was relatively more and more declining until 1688; as appears from the increa&s;ing ratio of di&s;parity of the value of equal incomes, and the increa&s;ing difference of the intere&s;t of money made by purcha&s;es in the two di&s;tricts, at each of tho&s;e terms.</P>
<P>In the year 1666, the mean value of land, in the home di&s;trict, was 19 years purcha&s;e;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Between 18 and 20 years.

<P>The mean value of land, in the remote di&s;trict, was at the &s;ame time 15 years purcha&s;e;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. between 14 and 16 years.</NOTE> and the price of an e&s;tate of equal rent, &pound;.7894: 14<HI>s.</HI> and the intere&s;t of the purcha&s;e money, &pound;.6&middot;6666 per cent.</P>
<P>Hence the proportion of the values of two e&s;tates, of equal rents, in the two di&s;tricts, was at that time as 10,000 to 7894; the difference of their &s;elling prices, 4 years purcha&s;e, or &pound;.2105; and the diffe|rence of the intere&s;t of the purcha&s;e-money, &pound;1&middot;4035 per cent.</P>
<P>Nothing but a general and great in&s;ecurity in the payment of rents, could have cau&s;ed &s;uch important differences, or rai&s;ed the intere&s;t, made by purcha&s;ing land, above the legal rate on private &s;ecurities; for the rent of land is the mo&s;t favourite &s;pecies of in|come. Now to tho&s;e who then bought e&s;tates with an intention to re&s;ide upon them, if the rents had been equally well paid, &pound;.526 a year, in the further di&s;trict, mu&s;t have been of much greater real value

<P>The increa&s;e of the in&s;ecurity of the landed income, in the re&s;t of the kingdom, may be exhibited in an|other point of view; by a&s;&s;igning the proportion of its effect to &s;ink the price of e&s;tates, to that of the cotemporary fall of intere&s;t, intimated above, to rai&s;e them. If the hazard of the payment of rent, in both
<PB N="14" REF="17">
di&s;tricts, had been the &s;ame in the &s;econd town as in the fir&s;t, the increa&s;e of the year's purcha&s;e, in each, would have been proportioned: hence, in the &s;ame time that the value of the land of the home coun|ties, increa&s;ed from 19 to 26&frac12; years purcha&s;e, in the remote counties it would have been augmented, in like manner, from 15 to (20.921) 21 years pur|cha&s;e. On the other hand, if the in&s;ecurity of the payment of rent had increa&s;ed in the &s;ame proportion as the rate of intere&s;t fell, or the year's purcha&s;e of the landed income ro&s;e, who&s;e degree of &s;ecurity was con&s;tant, which is here taken as having been the fact in the home counties; then the number of years purcha&s;e would have remained fixed; or fifteen times the rent have been the value of land in the remote di&s;trict in 1666 and 1688. Again, which is a third ca&s;e, if the hazard had increa&s;ed, but with le&s;s cele|rity than the rate of intere&s;t fell, the value of land would have been &s;omewhere between the two limits of 21 and 15 years purcha&s;e; who&s;e difference is &s;ix years. Now in effect this ca&s;e obtained, the&s;e lands had ri&s;en to be in value 17&frac12; years purcha&s;e, exhibit|ing an increa&s;e of 2&frac12; years: it has been proved, that the undimini&s;hed effect of the fall of intere&s;t, would have increa&s;ed their value by 6 years purcha&s;e: a part of its efficacy, therefore, and which would (if it had operated unoppo&s;ed) have rai&s;ed them 3&frac12; years purcha&s;e more, was counter-balanced by &s;ome de|pre&s;&s;ing cau&s;e; which, if acting alone, would have &s;unk them by that amount: and no adequate cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned, except the increa&s;ed hazard of the payment of rent. Hence, if the total efficacy of the fall of intere&s;t to rai&s;e the value of land, which took place in the&s;e 22 years, be conceived to be divided into 12 equal parts, the effect of 7 &s;uch parts will be found to have been annihilated by the increa&s;ing hazard of the payment of rent, or the forces of the&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="18">
oppo&s;ite cau&s;es to have been in that proportion; and the value of the e&s;tate to have been increa&s;ed by the 5 parts only which remained uncounterbalanced.</P>
<P>The value of land in the remote di&s;trict in the year 1666, was only 4 years purcha&s;e below that of the re&s;t of the kingdom: the difference had increa&s;ed to 9 years in the year 1688: the difference of intere&s;t made by purcha&s;es, which in the fir&s;t term was (&pound;.1.4035) &pound;.1&frac25; per cent. nearly, had, in the &s;econd, become augmented to (&pound;.1.9407) nearly 2 per cent. The re|mote di&s;trict was, therefore, relatively to the home di&s;trict, in a &s;tate of rapid decline, at the time the land-tax was impo&s;ed; and the &s;ame is true, even of the value of land, though it exhibits a &s;mall ab&s;olute ri&s;e.</P>
<P>It may not be here &s;uperfluous to explain, by an in&s;tance, the terms <HI>ab&s;olute ri&s;e</HI> and <HI>relative fall;</HI> and how both may be under&s;tood to be applied to the &s;ame thing, at the &s;ame point of time: for this di&s;tinction is always material when the magnitudes which two or more &s;ubjects, increa&s;ing with different degrees of celerity, attain, when compared at the be|ginning and end of a term of time. Therefore let there be &s;uppo&s;ed to be two bodies, ab&s;olutely with|out weight; whereof the fir&s;t is projected upwards, with two degrees of velocity, to continue uniformly the &s;ame; and let the &s;econd be in like manner pro|jected at the &s;ame in&s;tant, with one degree of cele|rity: now all con&s;ideration of weight, with re&s;pect to both, being out of the que&s;tion; at the end of a certain time, the &s;econd will be below the fir&s;t by a given di&s;tance; and at the end of double that time, by double that di&s;tance. Here the &s;econd body, at all times, will have a&s;cended ab&s;olutely; yet its di&s;tance below the fir&s;t will be always &s;uch, as it would have been if the fir&s;t had remained at re&s;t, and the &s;econd been projected in the oppo&s;ite direction, with one
<PB N="16" REF="19">
degree of uniform velocity, as before; therefore, con|&s;idered with re&s;pect to the place of the fir&s;t, it is &s;aid to have been, at all times, relatively falling.</P>
<P>Some account of the cau&s;e of the increa&s;ing in&s;e|curity of the payment of the rent of the remote di|&s;trict, may be given upon the authority of Mr. Locke. He de&s;cribes the artifices by which the purcha&s;ers of the product of the farmer had, at the time of his writing his Tract upon Intere&s;t, been able to impo&s;e their own prices upon him, and compel him, be&s;ide, to allow them long terms of credit, and the incapa|city of paying their rents, to which the farmers were thereby reduced: and he concludes, <Q>If any one doubt of this, let him enquire how many farmers of the we&s;t are broke and run away &s;ince Michael|mas la&s;t.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Locke, vol. 2. p. 13.</NOTE> From the whole of what he has &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, it is evident that the &s;ame account is applicable, though perhaps in a lower degree, to the northern counties.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have con&s;idered only the argument in defence of the original di&s;proportion of the land-tax, drawn from the declining circum&s;tances of the remote di&s;trict, at the time of its impo&s;ition; but the following &s;tate of the home divi&s;ion gave no in|con&s;iderable addition to its weight: and of this there is the &s;tronge&s;t evidence, in the &s;ingular fall of the rate of intere&s;t upon loans, mentioned above; by which the value of lands, in the home counties, was in 22 years rai&s;ed 7&frac12; years purcha&s;e. In con&s;idering this fall, every thing which relates to the fluctuations of the rate in that term, which were them&s;elves very re|markable, will be omitted. Some years before the time of Mr. Locke's writing his E&s;&s;ay on Intere&s;t, <Q>the &s;carcity of money made it, in England, really worth more than &pound;.6 per cent.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 5.</NOTE> but &s;o early as
<PB N="17" REF="20">
the year 1681, &s;uch a decrea&s;e of the current intere&s;t had taken place, that the Ea&s;t-India Company bor|rowed con&s;iderable &s;ums of money at &pound;.3 per cent. Houghton, who has pre&s;erved this fact, adds, <Q>that although he had &s;ecured the intere&s;t of one of the officers of the Hou&s;e, to obtain that rate for a friend, he failed of &s;ucce&s;s; and that money was then currently lent at &pound;4, 4&frac12;, and 5 per cent.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Houghton's Hu&s;bandry and Trade improved, vol. 4. p. 152.</NOTE> At the time of the Revolution, according to Davenant, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Davenant, vol. 1. p. 361.</NOTE> the greater part of the loans upon landed &s;ecurity, were at the two former rates.</P>
<P>This fall of intere&s;t is to be attributed, among other very accelerating cau&s;es, to the increa&s;e of our currency, at that time, by paper credit; which has been erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome not to have ex|i&s;ted, or at lea&s;t to have been in a very circum|&s;cribed &s;tate before the Revolution. The &s;hutting up of the Exchequer, in the year 1672, occa&s;ioned the failure of many bankers; and by laying open their accounts, &s;hew the extent which paper credit had then obtained. The circulating notes of one of them, on his &s;ingle &s;ecurity, exceeded &pound;.1,000,000;<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Locke, vol. 2. p. 5.</NOTE> but in 1688, it was &s;o much further increa&s;ed, <Q>that by its means our rents and taxes were paid, and the bulk of trade here at home, carried on almo&s;t with|out the &s;pecies of money:</Q> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Davenant, vol. 1. p. 151.</NOTE> and Davenant, from whom this extract is taken, further de&s;cribes the &s;tate into which it fell during the war of the Revolution, approaching to that of a total annihilation; and the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of its revival, as &s;uch, after the peace of Ri&s;wyck.</P>
<P>I have entered, with &s;ome detail, into this proof of the very flouri&s;hing &s;ituation of the home counties, and of the relative and increa&s;ing decline of the re|mote
<PB N="18" REF="21">
divi&s;ion, at the time of the impo&s;ition of the land-tax; becau&s;e it is &s;trongly connected to that in|equality of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments which has been perpetuated to this day; and it &s;hews that they &s;tood in need of &s;ome relief, though the remainder of the kingdom has cau&s;e to regret, that no other method was fol|lowed in affording a&s;&s;i&s;tance to them, than that which has been eventually &s;o unfortunate to them&s;elves. In the cour&s;e of the&s;e re&s;earches, two popular errors, in the hi&s;tory of our national wealth, appear like|wi&s;e to be done away: the one re&s;pecting the high rate of intere&s;t; the other, the extent of paper credit before the year 1688.</P>
<P>In the&s;e ob&s;ervations on the cau&s;es of the inequality of the land-tax, I have been obliged to go &s;o far with this &s;ketch of a comparative hi&s;tory of the &s;tate of the landed intere&s;ts, in the two di&s;tricts, that there is but little required to bring it to its ultimate pe|riod; and therefore it &s;hall be here given. The di&s;tant counties &s;eem to have recovered a total equa|lity with the re&s;t of the kingdom, as early as the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of George the Second. Guthrie informs us, that <Q>in the year 1727, the value of the northern counties of the kingdom began to be better under|&s;tood than formerly.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guthrie's Geography, ed. 1785, p. 367. 8vo.</NOTE> In the year 1729, the price of the land of England had increa&s;ed to 25&frac12; years purcha&s;e: this is given by Ander&s;on, a dili|gent collector of facts, as the general value of the whole kingdom.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">To 25 and 26 years purcha&s;e. Chalmers, p. 138.</NOTE> No di&s;tinction is here made of the prices of e&s;tates in the two di&s;tricts; and no traces of their di&s;parity, at any &s;ub&s;equent time, have oc|cured to me; I therefore conclude, that at this pe|riod a total equality had taken place between them. The national average price of land, in 1688, had
<PB N="19" REF="22">
been 19&frac38; years purcha&s;e nearly: it follows that this average had increa&s;ed, in the interval between the two la&s;t-mentioned years, by 6&frac18; years purcha&s;e; but that the value of land, in the home counties, having been 26&frac12; rents, had fallen one, while the remote di&s;trict had ri&s;en in price, from 17&frac12; to 25&frac12;, or 8 years purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>It remains only to account for this variation of the &s;tate of the two divi&s;ions: the inequality of the land-tax certainly much quickened the progre&s;s of the remote di&s;trict, fir&s;t to attain a level with the home counties; and afterward, in many circum&s;tances, a &s;uperiority above them; but before it was impo&s;ed, there were &s;ome natural cau&s;es in operation, which would have ultimately produced even the la&s;t of the&s;e effects, although its period had not been accelerated by an artificial cau&s;e in con&s;tant action; the oppre&s;|&s;ion of the remainder of the kingdom with a double land-tax. So early as the 1636, the home counties had begun <Q>to grub up their woods and di&s;park their parks</Q>;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davenant, vol. 1. p. 46.</NOTE> and carried that practice to a great extent. But the quantity of wood has been much more di|mini&s;hed &s;ince; and they are become in a manner tri|butary to the remote di&s;trict for fuel. The coal trade, though by no means arrived at its pre&s;ent magnitude, was increa&s;ing with rapidity at the time the Land-tax was fir&s;t rai&s;ed: in&s;omuch, that in the year 1695, it was found, that the quantity of coal con&s;umed in London, had been trebled of late years. Manufac|tures are attracted from one country to another by the cheapne&s;s of firing: and accordingly it was then laid down as a fact, "that of late years likewi&s;e" the north and we&s;t had acquired a greater proportion of trade, than the home counties.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> The Arguments in favour of the Inequality of the Land-tax, &s;tated and con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>THE advocates for the continuance of the pre|&s;ent proportion of the charge of the two di&s;tricts to the Land tax, argue thus: <Q>Its original e&s;tabli&s;h|ment was nece&s;&s;ary; for if was founded on the dif|ference of their abilities to contribute to the public expences: the hi&s;torical evidence on which this re&s;ts admits of no di&s;pute. At pre&s;ent, the natio|nal intere&s;t, and the national ju&s;tice, both urge its continuance; and the arguments for it, derived from each of the&s;e topics, are &s;o cogent, that they de&s;erve to be &s;eparately &s;tated.</Q></P>
<P><Q>How &s;trongly con&s;iderations of public intere&s;t and expedience, recommend the continuance of the old valuation, is thus made evident. No mate|rial increa&s;e of the charge of the tax upon the re|mote counties, can take place, without a corre|&s;ponding advance of rent; which mu&s;t be followed, by a proportional increa&s;e of the price of the far|mers products: and as that di&s;trict includes by much the large&s;t part of the kingdom, a general increa&s;e of its rent will produce ultimately a general ad|vance of the prices of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;aries of life.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But the effect of &s;uch an innovation will not ter|minate here. The claim upon which it is to be introduced, re&s;ts upon this principle; that the taxes upon rent ought always to vary with its amount, and be proportioned thereto. Hence every increa&s;e of rent, in every di&s;trict, mu&s;t con&s;tantly be accompanied with a proportional advance of the payment of the land to the State. A maxim
<PB N="21" REF="24">
of taxation, which, whatever &s;pecious pretences may be &s;et up in its favour, has always produced the wor&s;t effects, in tho&s;e counties where it has been carried into practice: in &s;ome of them, it has received the name of the <HI>Taille:</HI> and wherever it has been adopted, the &s;pirit of improvement in agriculture has not only been extingui&s;hed; but, in many in&s;tances, the art it&s;elf has gone backward. Thus the equalization of the tax will prevent the increa&s;e of product, which might otherwi&s;e coun|terbalance its effect upon prices.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But the mea&s;ure of the evils which will re&s;ult from the &s;ubver&s;ion of the old &s;y&s;tem, appears only of its proper magnitude in its &s;econdary con|&s;equences; or when tho&s;e primary effects of it, already pointed out, come to operate in conjunction by preventing the increa&s;e of productions, phy&s;i|cally nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of mankind, it puts a &s;top to the increa&s;e of population; and by its tendency to rai&s;e their prices, it perpetually takes &s;omething more and more away, from the comfort and happine&s;s of the lower clo&s;s of people; which their numerous privations, brought on by the charges of the State, have already too much dimini&s;hed. The greate&s;t object of a moral policy (and nature and virtue admit of no other) is to augment the number of a nation, and to increa&s;e their comforts, in the utmo&s;t practicable degree. Now the effects of this novelty are directly re|pugnant to the&s;e great ends; and we cannot for|bear adding how even that empty and delu&s;ive, but perhaps o&s;ten&s;ible pretence to ju&s;tice, on which it re&s;ts as a foundation, has been lately in &s;ome de|gree done away. Every one mu&s;t be convinced, that the hou&s;e-tax is a land-tax di&s;gui&s;ed under another name: by its impo&s;ition, this charge upon the remote di&s;trict has been effectively increa&s;ed
<PB N="22" REF="25">
&s;ince the fir&s;t valuation; and at the &s;ame time brought nearer to that proportionality, ince&s;&s;antly demanded with &s;o much clamour, and &s;o little rea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are the arguments, to the con&s;ideration of which, the remainder of this Section will be con|fined; but there is another con&s;tantly produced on this &s;ubject, upon which the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s is often affected to be laid: that all purcha&s;ers of e&s;tates in the remote di&s;trict, for a long &s;eries of years, have paid an increa&s;ed price for them; in con|fidence that the pre&s;ent proportion of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments &s;hould be continued to all future periods; and that it would he inju&s;tice to take from them, what they have paid a valuable con&s;ideration for. This argu|ment will be more fully &s;tated in the Fourth Section, and an an&s;wer to it given: no further notice will therefore be taken of it here. The con&s;ideration of tho&s;e which precede it, is now to be entered upon.</P>
<P>They &s;et out with a tacit defence of the continu|ance of the inequality, from a nece&s;&s;ity which aro&s;e, from the peculiar circum&s;tances of the home di&s;trict, at the juncture when it was &s;uffered to take place. That they &s;tood then in need of &s;ome relief, is not to be di&s;puted: and po&s;&s;ibly the ju&s;tice of that claim has been fortified with a new proof, in the preceding Section. Admitting it therefore in its full extent, it does not follow, that &s;uch relief ought originally to have been extended to them, in a mode contrary to the fir&s;t principles of taxation; nor (even that point be|ing gratuitou&s;ly given up) that the relief ought to have been prolonged, beyond the nece&s;&s;ity on which it was founded. Now all traces of the preexi&s;ting depre&s;|&s;ion of the remote di&s;trict, had been obliterated &s;o early as the year 1729; and the nece&s;&s;ity, and the inequality, ought to have terminated together.</P>
<P>The &s;econd plea urged is, that as the equalization
<PB N="23" REF="26">
of the tax will encrea&s;e its charge, throughout the great|er part of the kingdom, it mu&s;t effectively increa&s;e the national rent it&s;elf; and con&s;equently, the prices of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how, that it will neither effect rent nor prices. That it will not effect rent of land follows, fir&s;t, from the nature of the &s;ubject it&s;elf; which is clearly laid down by Dr. Adam Smith, in his work on the Wealth of Nations.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith, v. 1. p, 223.</NOTE> He informs us, that rent is always the large&s;t part of the value of the product of land, that can be taken from the farmer; allowing him the ordinary profits of &s;tock, after defraying his expences. Now this being admitted, in the latitude in which he has put it, that is, as a general principle; the rent mu&s;t be already arrived at this height in the remote counties: no further ri&s;e therefore can take place, merely in con&s;equence of the increa&s;e of the landlord's outgo|ing charges. For it will not create an ability in the tenant to pay him a greater &s;um; that ability being no more affected, by the increa&s;e of the landlord's payment to the public, than by an equal diminution of his income by any other means; as, by the aliena|tion of part of his e&s;tate, equal in rent to the additi|tious part of the tax, in con&s;equence of his former extravagance. In either ca&s;e, his wi&s;hes and efforts to enjoy the &s;ame neat income as before, will be equal; and the influence of his endeavours with his tenant, to rai&s;e his rent, becau&s;e his income is re|duced, will be equally efficacious. It is only an in|crea&s;e of the farmers product, or of the prices of that product, or both conjointly, which can rai&s;e the rent of any di&s;trict. When that rent, and the value of the product, are once adju&s;ted to each other, the increa&s;e of the latter mu&s;t always precede that of the former; as the cau&s;e mu&s;t always precede its effect.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27">But let it now be &s;uppo&s;ed, contrary to what has been &s;hown to follow from the nature of the &s;ubject, that the rents of the remote di&s;trict will be rai&s;ed; and that the farmers will attempt to rai&s;e their prices, to reimbur&s;e them&s;elves. There will be nothing in this advance, immediately to effect the rents or prices of the home di&s;trict. Now the two divi&s;ions of the kingdom have many common markets, foreign coun|tries, the metropolis; and all tho&s;e markets, in the interior parts of the kingdom, &s;ituated on their com|mon boundary line; and &s;ome miles within it, on each &s;ide. The farmers of the remote di&s;trict carry their products, now, to all tho&s;e markets, as equal competitors to tho&s;e on the other &s;ide of the boun|dary. But if they rai&s;e their prices, they will be no longer able to &s;upport that competition; or at lea&s;t their vent will be greatly dimini&s;hed. In either ca&s;e they will be forced to keep a greater quantity of their com|modities at home, than formerly: and their home demand not being increa&s;ed, the prices of their home market, in&s;tead of being &s;upported at the new rate, mu&s;t fall below that which took place before. Now an increa&s;e of rents can never &s;ub&s;i&s;t, with more cir|cum&s;cribed markets, and with declining prices: hence no advance can be put upon their rents, which &s;hall di&s;able them to go into the markets common to the two di&s;tricts, at the &s;ame prices as their competitors: the intere&s;t of the landlords them&s;elves mu&s;t pre|vent it; or in other words, they cannot rai&s;e their prices above the rate which would have taken place, if there had been no advance of rent.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ide the gratuitous admi&s;&s;ion of the po&s;|&s;ibility of the rent being increa&s;ed in the remote di&s;trict, in con&s;equence of the equalization of the tax; let it la&s;tly be conceded, that the farmers will not be prevented from rai&s;ing their prices, by the competition of tho&s;e of the home divi&s;ion: and
<PB N="25" REF="28">
let us enquire, what increa&s;e of the rate of their markets may now be expected to take place.</P>
<P>To equalize the tax upon the two di&s;tricts, the remote counties mu&s;t have their rate increa&s;ed one &s;hilling and &frac45;d. in the pound rent; or, &pound; 5:340:9&frac35; per cent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 9. &sect;. 1.</NOTE> On &s;uch an advance taking place, when an e&s;tate is to be let, it follows from what is conceded, that the treaty, or (as it is called by tho&s;e who have written on prices and commodities) the alteration, will run thus. The landlord will &s;ay: <Q>The decrea&s;e of my income by the new tax, is one &s;hilling and &frac45;d. in the pound; and you mu&s;t increa&s;e the rent in the &s;ame proportion.</Q> To this the tenant will reply: <Q>The markets are not advanced; nor will the land become more productive by virtue of the increa&s;e of the tax. The amount of my di&s;|bur&s;ements, the annual intere&s;t of my capital, the value of my labour, and of my &s;uperinten|dance, will continue undimini&s;hed: and I mu&s;t make the &s;ame profit for the immediate &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and the future provi&s;ion for my&s;elf and my family, as before. I therefore cannot con&s;ent to any ad|vance, demanded upon that account.</Q> We have &s;een before, the nullity of the landlord's preten&s;ions, and the validity of the rea&s;ons again&s;t them, urged by the tenant. But let it be admitted now that what is alledged on either &s;ide has equal force: hence the alteration will terminate, by the landlord's receding from half his additional demand, and the tenant &s;ub|miting to pay the additional tax, or to increa&s;e the rent 6&frac25;d. in the pound; that is (&pound;2.67) &pound;2:11:10&frac45; per cent.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 9 &sect;. 2.</NOTE> Let the effect of this, on the general price of provi&s;ions, be now enquired after.</P>
<P>It will be admitted without he&s;itation, that the price of the farmer's yearly product, if any variation
<PB N="26" REF="29">
be made in it, will, after this advance of rent, con|tinue to bear the &s;ame proportion to his total annual di&s;bur&s;ements, that was found to take place in the year 1774. The&s;e di&s;bur&s;ements are divi&s;ible into two cla&s;&s;es: the fir&s;t increa&s;ing immediately, by the increa&s;e of his rent operating alone; and the &s;econd, comprehending wages, the wages of labour, &s;eed|corn, and &s;ome other particulars; by the effect of an increa&s;e of prices of nece&s;&s;aries already e&s;tabli&s;hed; and following upon &s;uch increa&s;e, either immedi|ately, or at the end of a term more or le&s;s remote. An increa&s;e of di&s;bur&s;ements of the latter kind, can|not impre&s;s a beginning of movement upon the market, or produce an initial ri&s;e of prices; becau&s;e an effect cannot generate its cau&s;e. But if the far|mer's out-going expences of this &s;econd cla&s;s, be in|crea&s;ed in con&s;equence of a preceding ri&s;e of markets, occa&s;ioned by an advance of rent; this may lay him under a nece&s;&s;ity of making a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urther augmentation of his prices, or generate a &s;econd addition to their rates. But this &s;econdary addition cannot take place, until the fir&s;t in order (the cau&s;e on which its exi&s;tence de|pends) is e&s;tabli&s;hed in the market. The point to be proved therefore, is, that &s;uch initial advance cannot take place.</P>
<P>The expences of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, who&s;e increa&s;e is, or may very probably be, immediately con&s;equent upon the increa&s;e of rent, are the pari&s;h charges, and the tithe: now let the former rent of the tenant have been &pound;19&middot;200,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 9. &sect; 2.</NOTE> according to the average pro|portion, found to obtain throughout the kingdom; the &s;um of this rent and tho&s;e two charges, would have been &pound;21&middot;436:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 9. &sect; 2.</NOTE> and that &s;um will be now increa&s;ed in the &s;ame proportion the rent is increa&s;ed; that is, &pound;2&middot;67<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 9. &sect; 2.</NOTE> percent as above, or by &pound;0&middot;572.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 9. &sect; 2.</NOTE>
<PB N="27" REF="30">
And all the farmer's annual di&s;bur&s;ements, including the maintenance of his family; which before amounted, according to the &s;ame average, to &pound;60&middot;331;&dagger; will now be augmented to &pound;60&middot;903; and the &s;elling value of his total product mu&s;t be increa&s;ed in the &s;ame pro|portion. That value had before amounted to &pound;72&middot;826; and it mu&s;t now become &pound;73&middot;516; that is, it will be augmented 18s. and 11d.&frac12; per cent. The effect of this may be &s;hown on the price of wheat, the article of his product the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to general &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Wheat at this time, is about 44s. the quarter; its price, with this augmentation upon it, will be &pound;2. 2<HI>s.</HI> 5<HI>d</HI>1/250.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 9. &sect;. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>If all the farmers in the remote di&s;trict were te|nants at will, according to the &s;uppo&s;ition on which we are now tacitly rea&s;oning; each of them would have his rent increa&s;ed, in the fir&s;t year of the in|crea&s;e of the tax, according to the proportion here given; and the a&s;&s;igned advance might ju&s;tly in|deed be made general through the whole di&s;trict. It &s;eems however too minute to produce any effect in the market; as the lo&s;s to the farmer would be the increa&s;e of the expence of production only; equal to about one third of the increa&s;e of the price above &s;tated; and therefore le&s;s than two pence the quarter of wheat.</P>
<P>But it is only a part of the whole body of far|mers, who&s;e terms will expire, and who&s;e rents can be thus rai&s;ed, in that fir&s;t, or any &s;ucceeding year: a circum&s;tance which mu&s;t be taken into the account. And therefore it is to be ob&s;erved, that lands are let for different terms. Although there are &s;ome farmers who are tenants at will, by much the greater part of the land is under lea&s;e or article for a term cer|tain; as for 7, 10, 12, 14, or even 21 years. Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the term of all the contracts for the remote counties, is, on an average, &s;even years,
<PB N="28" REF="31">
upon the equality of chance; the term of one farmer of &s;even will expire in any a&s;&s;igned year. Now the far|mer who&s;e rent is rai&s;ed at the Michaelmas immedi|ately following the augmentating of the tax, is ju&s;tly entitled to &s;ell his commodities at the advanced rate &s;tated above: but the remaining &s;ix farmers of every &s;et of &s;even will be as well able to &s;ell at the old prices as before. Let us now take as an in&s;tance one of the&s;e &s;ets, &s;uppo&s;ing the rents of all the far|mers equal, and &s;eek what effect the advance of the prices of the &s;ingle individual will have in market. Now it is evident it will be the &s;ame, as if we &s;uppo&s;e the rent of the &s;ingle man above mentioned is &s;even times its former amount; but that it is rai&s;ed only the &s;ame &s;um as before. Now the quantity of his product being in the pro|portion of &s;even to one, he will be completely re|imbur&s;ed, by one &s;eventh of the former rate of his advance on his prices; that is, by 3/7 of a penny on the quarter of wheat; or 2<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> &frac12; per cent. on the &s;elling price of all his commodities.</P>
<P>This is the rate of advance, averaged upon the whole di&s;trict; which will reimbur&s;e the general body of the farmers, at the old rate of profit, for the ad|ditional charge, the advance of rent in the fir&s;t year will bring upon them: and it is too minute, for them to take any mea&s;ures in that year to obtain it. If even the advance of rent had at this time fallen at once on the whole body, there is little probability that it would have di&s;turbed the rates of the markets: and that increa&s;e of charge falling on one &s;eventh of their whole number only, in the fir&s;t year of the augmentation of the tax, its effect is &s;o far in&s;en&s;ible, that it &s;eems to leave no tendency to an advance of prices behind it. Things once fixed, completely re&s;i&s;t a &s;maller degree of force tending to a change. They in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;emble heavy bodies at re&s;t;
<PB N="29" REF="32">
which require a power of a certain magnitude to be applied to them, which mu&s;t exceed what is &s;ufficient to counterbalance friction, or a kind of adhe&s;ion to their &s;ituation, before they can be put into motion. If the increa&s;e of the rent had taken place all at once, it would mo&s;t probably have pa&s;&s;ed off, without any effect on the market prices; but its whole power up|on them will be divided into &s;even parts, each ta|king place at di&s;tant intervals. And in this ca&s;e, we may fairly recur to the former illu&s;tration, and &s;ay: If we admit that a certain force, when applied to a body all at once, may be capable of overcoming this re&s;i&s;tance of cohe&s;ion; and to produce a &s;mall, but almo&s;t imperceptible movement in it; yet if this moving power be divided into many parts, and each applied in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the effect of each will be &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively lo&s;t, before the application of the next, and no movement ultimately produced.</P>
<P>The next objection in order, is, that if the tax be from time to time augmented, it will degenerate into that &s;pecious of impo&s;ition upon land, which is called abroad the <HI>Taille,</HI> which has, in every country where it has been adopted, been found to ob&s;truct all in|crea&s;e of the quantity of land brought into cultiva|tion, and tho&s;e improvements which augment the product of land already cultivated. Thus, by pre|venting the multiplication of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, it deprives the lower cla&s;s of people of a liberal &s;upport; and even, by a diminution of its numbers, makes a wa&s;te of human life.</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to this, it mu&s;t be proved that every plan for augmenting the land-tax, does not terminate in &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem; and to do this, it is nece&s;&s;ary to lay down the following preliminary divi&s;ion of the &s;ubject. The effect of the ri&s;e of the tax may be different, as it takes place after improvement of the annual value of land, either immediately, or at the
<PB N="30" REF="33">
end of &s;ome definitive term of time. It may al&s;o differ, when land is to be improved by the capital of the tenant, or that of the landlord. The combina|tion of the&s;e circum&s;tances, affords four di&s;tinct ca&s;es for our con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Let us fir&s;t examine the two ca&s;es, where the ri&s;e of the tax immediately accompanies the advance, of the improving value of the land; not entering at pre&s;ent into any con&s;ideration of the means of car|rying &s;uch a mea&s;ure into execution. The greater part of the improvements of the value of land is, ef|fected at the expence of the tenant: this therefore is the ca&s;e fir&s;t con&s;idered. In order to be induced to undertake it, he mu&s;t have a lea&s;e at a fixed rent, for a con&s;iderable term of years. But here the land|lord may have frequently a temporary intere&s;t again&s;t &s;uch improvements, and con&s;equently again&s;t grant|ing all &s;uch lea&s;es, of the &s;ame duration as the term of the contract, and of no &s;mall magnitude. This will be a great check upon long and improving lea&s;es: for while the value of the e&s;tate is increa&s;ing, the tax will be perpetually increa&s;ing; and the landlord's gro&s;s rent remaining fixed during the whole term, his neat income will be perpetually decrea&s;ing. We know how a &s;mall pre&s;ent intere&s;t can counter|balance a great advantage, if remote. But the im|mediate intere&s;t here treated of, is not a &s;mall one. When the improvements of the tenant are &s;pirited and judicious, and he has a long term before him (the only thing which can call forth &s;uch vigorous and beneficial exertions from him), the annual value of the land may come to be doubled, or more than doubled, during its &s;ub&s;i&s;tance; and the tax increa&s;ing with that value, cau&s;e a very &s;en&s;ible diminution of the landlord's neat income. And &s;ometimes he may even find him&s;elf in con&s;iderable embarra&s;&s;ments, throughout the whole remainder of the term, after
<PB N="31" REF="34">
the&s;e improvements &s;hall have become fully effective: and it is the intere&s;t of the tenant to make them &s;o, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. In this ca&s;e, the landlord will not always find the pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s of his &s;ituation, counterbalanced by the reflection that he, or per|haps his heirs, will, at a remote period, reap a great advantage by an advance of rent. If the increa&s;e of the tax &s;hould therefore follow, directly upon the increa&s;e of the annual value of land, &s;uch lea&s;es, it may be pre&s;umed, would be le&s;s frequently granted.</P>
<P>When the landlord is at the expence of the im|provement, he is not expo&s;ed to the hazard of the&s;e inconveniencies. At his contract for a lea&s;e for any term of years, he will obtain an increa&s;e of rent, in proportion to the &s;peculated value of his improve|ments: this will con&s;i&s;t of the annual intere&s;t of the capital he advances; an annual profit upon it, of the nature of a commercial profit; and the amount of the expected increa&s;e of the tax. The&s;e points he mu&s;t have a rea&s;onable pro&s;pect to &s;ecure; or he mu&s;t act without a motive, or on the ab&s;tract con&s;i|deration of public good only. But in this ca&s;e, <Q>the landlord would certainly be le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to im|prove, when the &s;overeign, who contributes no|thing to the expence, was to &s;hare in the profit of the improvement.</Q> Hence the progre&s;s of culti|vation, as far as it depends upon the capital of the land-owner, might receive &s;ome little check, but by no means &s;o con&s;iderable as that pointed in the fir&s;t ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But admitting that augmenting tax, immediately upon every increa&s;e of the annual value of land, may be attended with &s;ome con&s;equences that are ineligi|ble, and &s;ome difficulties in execution; it does not thence follow, that a territorial valuation, once e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, &s;hould remain invariable to the end of time; e&s;pecially, if in its origin it was oppre&s;&s;ive and une|qual:
<PB N="32" REF="35">
or, according to what has been laid down by &s;ome on this head, that &s;uch valuations &s;hould not be revi&s;ed, above once in a century at mo&s;t; although it is to be cur&s;orily ob&s;erved here, that even admit|ing the la&s;t principle, a century is &s;o nearly elap&s;ed &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the tax, that the home di|&s;trict may now re&s;t its claim to equalization upon it.</P>
<P>It remains now to con&s;ider, whether, if the in|crea&s;e of the land-tax &s;hould follow that of the rent, at any a&s;&s;ignable term or di&s;tance of time, it would produce the bad effects in&s;eparably attached to that levy called a <HI>Taille.</HI> This inquiry likewi&s;e involves two ca&s;es: but before they be &s;eparately gone into, the &s;uppo&s;ition on which they both of them depend, that &s;uch an increa&s;e of the land-tax is practicable, mu&s;t be examined. The proof that a mea&s;ure is practicable, ought certainly to precede the con&s;ide|ration of its expedience.</P>
<P>If ever there &s;hould be an attempt made, to intro|duce a permanent corre&s;pondence between the tax and the value of the land, the oppo&s;ition to it will endeavour to make a vigorous &s;tand upon this point; and &s;uch erroneous opinions have, by &s;ome anticipation, been inculcated re&s;pecting it, that many of tho&s;e mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially intere&s;ted in its defence have &s;ometimes &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to give it up. I &s;hall therefore begin this examination, with a maxim drawn from the code of political morality. If men would but dedicate half that exerci&s;e of the under&s;tanding, to reduce what is ju&s;t to a practicable form, which they apply to &s;upport in&s;titutions which re&s;t upon no proper ba&s;is of principle; employing all the indirect policy, and perplexed patchwork of expedients, to make them rub on without any violent &s;hock or ob|&s;truction; they would generally find their work nei|ther difficult, nor its event doubtful. What is ju&s;t, has in its own nature a &s;trong tendency to become
<PB N="33" REF="36">
practicable; and almo&s;t to find the way to become effective it&s;elf. It wants but few helps and previous arrangements; and tho&s;e, a very moderate degree of circum&s;pection will ea&s;ily &s;ugge&s;t. Temper it only with &s;o much indulgence to the per&s;onal intere&s;ts which &s;eem attacked by it, as you well can without defeating its end (and that power is &s;eldom greatly circum&s;cribed), and you mu&s;t &s;ucceed. The narrow and awkward ground, which you force tho&s;e who op|po&s;e you to take, and the &s;hame of making a per|&s;evering and decided &s;tand upon it, half di&s;arms them to your hands.</P>
<P>That adju&s;tments of the advance of the tax to the advance of the rent, may be reduced into practice, has been fully &s;hown by Dr. Adam Smith;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith, v. 3. p. 64.</NOTE> and how the latter may be always di&s;covered. But to antici|pate all objections to the gradual increa&s;e of the tax, the rent of the la&s;t pa&s;t lea&s;e or contract might be made the value taxed in every year; not the pre&s;ent exi&s;ting rent, which &s;eems &s;o far to dimini&s;h the temptation and facility of fraud, as almo&s;t to anni|hilate it.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">By this mode many objections to the regi&s;ters of lea&s;es, for the purpo&s;e of determining rates and charges upon land, are anticipated. It dimini&s;hes the temptations of fal&s;ification, inci|dent to &s;ome other plans. Two men may combine together to make a fal&s;e entry, where a true one would be followed with an immediate increa&s;e of &s;ome annual payment, to be made by either or both: but if the increa&s;e of charge be remote; as, for in|&s;tance, if it be not to take place until the end of a lea&s;e now entered upon; the temptation to a fraudulent entry will be almo&s;t annihilated. Where a pre&s;ent or almo&s;t immediate &s;acrifice of property is called for, a fraud may be committed; but if it be not actually to be made, in le&s;s than &s;even, or perhaps ten years, after the account is given in, men will readily con&s;ent to it. They will &s;eldom venture upon a piece of knavery, when they know it mu&s;t be &s;o long before they can expect to reap the beneficial effects of it. Be&s;ide the interval between the regi&s;try and the commencement of the next contract, when the increa&s;e of the tax is to take place, mu&s;t be long; and the chances of the di&s;covery of the fraud, multiplied in proportion. If the pari&s;h rates were to follow the valuation of the land-tax thus adju&s;ted, it would take off a &s;imilar di&s;couragement to improvements in agriculture, that of being followed up immediately with an increa&s;e of charges of another kind. And no fraud would thus probably find its way, either into the rates, or into the regi&s;ter; for &s;uch a fraud would not dimini&s;h the charges of the per&s;on committing it: and it would expo&s;e him to great re&s;entment from his neighbours; as &s;acrificing their future intere&s;t, without any advantage to him&s;elf. Be&s;ides, every contributor in a pari&s;h would for his own &s;ake be a vigilant guard over all the re&s;t: the probable number of frauds woule be greatly dimini&s;hed; and the chances of the di&s;covery of each, greatly increa&s;ed: and the pari&s;h rates would either keep errors out of the public regi&s;ter, or afford &s;everal valuable cor|rections to it. This mode of increa&s;ing the tax has likewi&s;e another good property. Dr. A. Smith (v. 3. p. 257) has ob&s;erved, that <Q>every tax ought to be levied at the time, and in the manner, that is mo&s;t convenient for the contributors to pay it.</Q> Now this maxim, which primarily refers the original impo&s;ition of a tax, holds likewi&s;e of all its &s;ub&s;equent augmentations. For, according to this arrangement, the tax will always come to be increa&s;ed, at a time when the landlord has enjoyed the augmen|tation of the rent, on which the addition is to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, with|out deduction, for the complete term of one lea&s;e; and at a time likewi&s;e, when he has probably &s;ecured a &s;econd augmen|tation of rent, by a &s;econd contract: for, as the average value of land is con&s;tantly increa&s;ing, an increa&s;e of rent will be mo&s;tly obtained at every new letting.</NOTE> In what manner a &s;imilar and equivalent
<PB N="34" REF="37">
indulgence is to be extended to tho&s;e who occupy their own lands, has been explained by the &s;ame writer.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith, v. 3. p. 268.</NOTE></P>
<P>It appears that, under the&s;e modifications, the tax may be made to increa&s;e with the ability of the con|tributors, without great difficulty. The inquiry is now to be re&s;umed, whether being con&s;tantly &s;o aug|mented, it will nor be followed with the bad effects of a <HI>Taille:</HI> and here let it be fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed, as be|fore, that the improvement is to be made by the te|nant; and that it is a great and &s;pirited operation, requiring the advance of a large capital. For if it be
<PB N="35" REF="38">
found that the gradual advance of the tax, as de&s;cribed above, will be no ob&s;truction to a greater improve|ment, it cannot be requi&s;ite to &s;how in particular, that it will be no impediment to others, upon a le&s;s exten&s;ive &s;cale. The general circum&s;tances of &s;uch undertakings, as far as they affect the que&s;tion, are the&s;e: the land is to be taken, as having been let be|fore at a moderate rent, according to its former condition: its advance to the in-coming tenant will be either nothing, or very &s;mall, on account of the great expence he mu&s;t incur in the propo&s;ed improve|ments he will al&s;o take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">are to &s;ecure him&s;elf a &s;ufficient term; to pay him the in&s;urance of his hazard, and to enable him to reap the profit of his &s;pirited in|du&s;try. Now during this term, which mu&s;t be con|&s;iderable, if any &s;mall advance of the rent had been acceded to by him in the begining of it; the tax will be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to its former, not its pre&s;ent amount, ac|cording to the leading principle of its augmentation, de&s;cribed above. At the end of the term there will be a &s;econd contract; when the e&s;tate will be let to the full of its improved value, or nearly &s;o. And during its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence the tax will become increa&s;ed, in pro|portion to the augmentation of the rent, by the fir&s;t lea&s;e only; which advance, it was &s;hown, could not be very con&s;iderable. And at this rate the valuation will remain fixed, during the whole of the &s;econd term: and ultimately, at the end thereof, or at the begin|ning of the third lea&s;e, the tax will be rai&s;ed to cor|re&s;pond to the &s;econd rent, or the improved value of the land.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;earch, what there is in the&s;e circum|&s;tances to hinder an improvement, which would take place if the tax were fixed. If, contrary to the plan here traced out, the great augmentation of the tax were to take place, immediately with that of the rent, at the expiration of the improving lea&s;e; the farmer
<PB N="36" REF="39">
would not have been originally deterred from accept|ing it, by the con&s;ideration that an addition would be made to his landlord's outgoing charges, at the in|&s;tant his pre&s;ent connection with him was to termi|nate. He will know that at the end of the lea&s;e, if he think &s;o long beforehand of treating again for the farm, that the landlord will get as much for the improved value of it, as he will be able to pay, or nearly &s;o; and that he can get no more. And as that future addition to his rent mu&s;t depend upon other circum&s;tances, he will not at all con&s;ider, how one eighth or one tenth of it will be drawn out of his landlord's &s;trong box, at the end of fourteen or twenty-one years to come.</P>
<P>Yet it is here admitted, that the great improvement of the value will be taxed immediately at the termi|nation of the fir&s;t letting; whereas, according to the mode &s;uppo&s;ed to be followed, that material aug|mentation of the tax corre&s;ponding to it, will not take place until the end of the &s;econd lea&s;e. The increa&s;e at the end of the fir&s;t, being proportioned to the fir&s;t augmentation of the rent, which mu&s;t have been either &s;mall or nothing, on account of the ex|pence of the farmer at his fir&s;t improvement; the augmentation of the tax corre&s;ponding to that im|provement, will only commence with the third lea&s;e. Now no man will carry his &s;peculations to a futurity &s;o remote, as, previous to entering on a contract for a farm &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch improvement, to con&s;ider on what terms he could obtain a third lea&s;e; or what his landlord's a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment to the taxes would be in|crea&s;ed to at the end of that length of time, to which the &s;econd will extend. As to the &s;mall advance to be made at the beginning of the &s;econd term, if any, it has been already &s;een, that a much greater would then produce no effect.</P>
<P>It remains to be examined, how far the increa&s;e of
<PB N="37" REF="40">
the tax, thus modified, will be a check upon the &s;pi|rit of improvement in the landlords. And let it be &s;uppo&s;ed here, that the augmentation of the tax will ultimately be an eighth or a tenth of the increa&s;e of the annual value of the land. In fact, the average effective tax of the kingdom does not exceed a fif|teenth of the rent; when its nominal rate is four &s;hil|lings in the pound. When the tenant improves his land upon a long lea&s;e, he knows he &s;hall, at the end of the term, be obliged to pay an advance of rent equal to that of the value of the land, or very nearly &s;o: yet this does not now hinder him from making &s;uch improvements, at his own expence. When it is done by the landlord, he obtains immediately an in|crea&s;e of rent in con&s;equence of it, equal to the value of the improvement: and the tax will take from him, but an eighth or tenth of the augmentation of that annual value, at the end of the &s;ame term, at which the whole would be taken by the ri&s;e of rent, from the improving farmer. Hence, if giving up the whole of the augmented value, at the expiration of the lea&s;e, do not hinder the farmer's improvement; one eighth, or one tenth, being taken from the addition to the landlord's rent at the &s;ame term, will produce no effect.</P>
<P>It has been urged by one writer, that the hou&s;e-tax is in its nature a land-tax; and con&s;equently, having been laid upon the remote di&s;trict long after the im|po&s;ition of the former, its original degree of inequa|lity no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. He might have proceeded to confirm his acute conclu&s;ion, with the mathematical axiom&mdash;That if, to unequal magnitudes, equal magni|tudes be added, the quantities &s;o increa&s;ed, will ap|proach nearer to the ratio of equality, than the two fir&s;t. I will not expo&s;e to po&s;thumous cen&s;ures, the well-earned reputation of a man eminent in his own laborious branch of &s;cience; in which he rendered

to the public the greate&s;t &s;ervices, by quoting him by name, or referring to the books from which &s;uch an imbecility is copied. The an&s;wer is contained in a few words: the hou&s;e-tax is general, and at the &s;ame rate throughout the whole kingdom, including the home di&s;trict; and therefore the payment of it does not exempt any other di&s;trict from paying its equi|table proportion to any other tax.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> On the Probability that the Amount of the Land-Tax mu&s;t be increa&s;ed at a very near Period.</HEAD>
<P>THE foundation on which the re&s;ult of all inquiry into the probability of the future increa&s;e of the charge of the land-tax, ought to re&s;t, mu&s;t be found in its general nature, and the exi&s;ting circum&s;tances of the State. In the con&s;ideration of the nature of a land-tax, &s;ome principles will be laid down, tending to &s;how that it is, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> to be preferred, perhaps, to all others. The natural limitation of tho&s;e principles will al&s;o be afterwards added, though not nece&s;&s;ary to the points to be proved: for general principles, which differ from univer&s;als, by being limited by an internal nece&s;&s;ity, or external circum|&s;tances, are frequently &s;et up as &s;uch, or abu&s;ively confounded with them; but they ought never to be brought forward, without duly &s;pecifying the point at which they cea&s;e to be applicable, unle&s;s it is well known or &s;elf-evident.</P>
<P>Taxes are e&s;tabli&s;hed, as well for the purpo&s;e of political regulation, as effective revenue: &s;uch as at once an&s;wer both the&s;e ends, are the be&s;t. Now a land-tax is an effective and &s;umptuary tax, and un|equalled
<PB N="39" REF="42">
in the degree in which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the&s;e two properties: for no plan for collecting a revenue, from the great incomes derived from monied capitals, or the annual fund of expenditure of the more opulent traders, has been hitherto carried into execution with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved, by a political writer of the fir&s;t e&s;timation, that as productive <Q>capital is the &s;ource of indu&s;try, &s;o revenue is the &s;ource of idlene&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith's Wealth of Nations, v. 2. p. 12.</NOTE></Q> The glitter, the magnificence, and &s;ometimes the di&s;&s;ipation of the opulent proprietor of land, becomes the example of tho&s;e who derive great incomes from other &s;ources; and they &s;eem to undergo &s;omething like the rever&s;e of improvement in the tran&s;planting. The greate&s;t number of the&s;e copyi&s;ts, like tho&s;e who propo&s;e &s;plendid, but faulty originals, as models, ex|hibit their faults, at &s;econd-hand, &s;omething in|crea&s;ed; and the effects of the other parts, not a little dimini&s;hed. If the luxuries of this cla&s;s could be reached by a tax, the moral benefits to &s;ociety would be great; and, perhaps, no permanently u&s;eful in|&s;titution of policy ever exi&s;ted, which did not draw that con&s;equence after it. But to drop the con&s;idera|tion of what &s;eems, but perhaps only &s;eems, un|attainable; we may ob&s;erve, that drawing an effective revenue from land, attacks this progre&s;s of luxury at its very &s;ource, and greatly retards, though it can|not totally counteract it. There is a con&s;equence of this which de&s;erves attention.</P>
<P>In the natural hi&s;tory of human &s;ociety we find, that when it has once attained to a &s;tate of manly elegance, it pa&s;&s;es on next to refinement; and ulti|mately to a vitiated and effeminate voluptuou&s;ne&s;s. Whatever is noble and excellent mu&s;t decline in each &s;tep of this fatal progre&s;s; and even whatever tends to
<PB N="40" REF="43">
accelerate the tran&s;actions of &s;ociety, from the fir&s;t to the &s;econd of the&s;e &s;tates, mu&s;t be numbered among the greate&s;t evils; whatever retards it, among the greate&s;t benefits to mankind. It is like a medi|cine which would prolong the continuance of youth and manhood, and &s;u&s;pend the approach of the im|becility and mi&s;eries of old-age. And I add, that a &s;ober philo&s;ophy may prepare &s;uch a tincture for &s;ociety, though not for the individual: though there is nothing more deleterious, than the preparations which pretend to the&s;e properties, which are to be found in the laboratories of &s;ome great modern chy|mi&s;ts.</P>
<P>The luxuries of a wealthy &s;ociety are the cau&s;e of this progre&s;s. It is always the object of that of to-day, to pa&s;s the bounds of that of ye&s;terday: and whatever checks it in its cour&s;e, at lea&s;t retards the celerity with which &s;ociety is gliding down this de|&s;cent; and lengthens out the exi&s;tence of its arts, its manners, and its morals.</P>
<P>The tendency of a tax on land to produce this be|neficial effect, is evident: by ab&s;orbing a ju&s;t part of the income of the proprietor, it dimini&s;hes the &s;trength of the primary cau&s;e of the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive de|generacies in the &s;tate of &s;ociety. It is to be ob|&s;erved on the other hand, that whatever makes his capacity of expence increa&s;e, with greater celerity than his rent, will anticipitate the terms of tho&s;e changes, and con&s;equently be pernicious: the circum&s;tance here taken as a &s;uppo&s;ition only, will be afterward found to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>There are further con&s;iderations which &s;how the rent of land to be a more proper &s;ubject of taxation than mo&s;t others: and one is, that to make a due pro|portion of the public charges fall upon it, leaves the quantity of comfort and enjoyment, remaining to &s;ociety after &s;uch a tax, the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible; as no
<PB N="41" REF="44">
way has been di&s;covered to come at the great monied incomes; which, therefore, are not here to be con|&s;idered: for the deduction of the &s;ame proportional part from the incomes of any two men, are here &s;up|po&s;ed equally to dimini&s;h their capacity of acquiring the cu&s;tomary comforts of their &s;ituation. A tax ex|clu&s;ively falling upon land, affects only a cla&s;s of men which is, upon the average, extremely opulent: but in ca&s;e the &s;ame money were levied by a general tax, the lower orders of the people would have been obliged to pay their &s;hare to it, and their comfort would have been dimini&s;hed, in the proportion which the annual &s;um &s;o taken from them bears to their annual income: but as it is now paid by the opulent proprietors of land, their enjoyments will be dimi|ni&s;hed, only in the proportion the &s;ame &s;um bears to their great annual income; that is, indefinitely le&s;s; or the comfort enjoyed by the whole &s;ociety, con&s;i|dered as an aggregate, remain much greater. It is evident likewi&s;e, that it tends to render the en|joyments of the &s;eparate cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety more equal.</P>
<P>A tax on land tends al&s;o to render the inequalities of rank and fortune le&s;s glaringly offen&s;ive to tho&s;e whom civil &s;ociety, by the operation of its very na|ture, has &s;ubjected to numerous and afflicting priva|tions of the enjoyments of life. For if we &s;uppo&s;e the pre&s;ent land-tax taken off, a greater and more pa|rading di&s;play of the di&s;parity of the circum&s;tances and ranks of the cla&s;&s;es of civil &s;ociety, would take place: and the irk&s;ome &s;en&s;e of it in the inferior or|ders, mu&s;t be aggravated in proportion; a &s;en&s;e, which enters perhaps for no incon&s;iderable part of the calamities of that cla&s;s, who&s;e feelings of their own &s;tate will always be numbered among the objects mo&s;t worthy of re&s;pect, by a wi&s;e and benevolent legi&s;lature.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="45">But it may be made evident, that the landlords cannot be charged with more than a certain part of the public burthens, by a tax on their e&s;tates, with|out the injury extending beyond them&s;elves, and af|fecting the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety. They contribute to the general taxes; to many they pay as much, and to many, more than their relative proportion: there are &s;ome likewi&s;e to which their contributions, for cer|tain cau&s;es, are le&s;s. But, upon the balance, their other taxes will be found to be at lea&s;t in proportion to their total incomes; and the land-tax to be purely an additional charge, exceeding that proportion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I thought I had been alone in this opinion, but find my&s;elf preceded in it by Sir Nathaniel Gould and Baron Ma&s;eres..</NOTE>; and &s;uch payments neither can or ought to be carried beyond a certain extent.</P>
<P>For the ability of paying the&s;e addititious charges, mu&s;t be confined to that cla&s;s of the landed men, who&s;e circum&s;tances are &s;o ea&s;y, that they can commodiou&s;ly &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon their incomes: and let it be admitted, that this may be extended &s;o low, as to take in that order of men, which Mr. King, in arranging the na|tion into cla&s;&s;es, denominated freeholders of the better &s;ort; who&s;e income from land, at this time, upon an average, may &s;omewhat exceed &pound;.180 a year; and which was valued by him, in 1688, at &pound;.91: and let it be admitted, that the incomes of the different cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety bear the &s;ame proportion now, each to each and to the whole, which he found to take place in 1688. If this amount be divided into a thou&s;and equal parts, the income of the more opulent land|lords is 218<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 8. &sect; 2.</NOTE>; of the labouring people, 207<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 8. &sect; 2.</NOTE>; and of the remainder of the &s;ociety, including the mer|cantile and monied intere&s;ts, 574<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 8. &sect; 2.</NOTE> &s;uch parts. The income of the lower cla&s;s, as exhibited here, falls &s;hort of, rather than exceeds, its pre&s;ent proportion,
<PB N="43" REF="46">
according to &s;ome accounts which have fallen into my hands. It is nearly in the proportion <HI>&s;hown above,</HI> or 218 thou&s;andth parts of the whole which they pay by the general taxes. That denomination is here given to the remainder of our taxes, which are pay|able by the people in general, including the propor|tion of land, and not by the latter exclu&s;ively.</P>
<P>Now the total amount of the general taxes is &pound;.15&middot;162 ms. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 8. &sect; 3.</NOTE>: and the part thereof paid by the great landed proprietors, proportioned to their in|come, is &pound;.3&middot;312 ms.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 8. &sect; 3.</NOTE> Moreover, the total land-tax being &pound;.1&middot;962 ms. its proportional charge on this cla&s;s is &pound;.1&middot;434 ms.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. &sect; 4.</NOTE> and their total payment to all taxes &pound;.4&middot;746 ms.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. &sect; 4.</NOTE> exceeding their proportional charge, in the ratio of 14,330 to 10,000<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. &sect; 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This exce&s;s is greater in the home di&s;trict, le&s;s in the remote, than the average here a&s;&s;igned; and if the land-tax were equalized, the whole cla&s;s of the land-owners would contribute to the expence of the State, in the &s;ame proportion as tho&s;e of the home di&s;trict pay at pre&s;ent. The &s;um of the taxes, on the income of land, would become five &s;hillings and five-pence in the pound; and on all other incomes, on an ave|rage, three &s;hillings and three-pence and one third:<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Section IV. Table.</NOTE> or the former would be to the latter, as five to three.</P>
<P>But by carrying this &s;y&s;tem too far, the opulence of this cla&s;s will become more reduced than is con&s;i&s;tent with the general intere&s;t of &s;ociety. When every man is taxed according to his income, the pro|portional power of every cla&s;s, which depends very much on the exi&s;ting divi&s;ion of property, remains unaltered. Now the inequality of its pre&s;ent divi|&s;ion is natural, as far as human &s;ociety, of which it is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, is natural: hence that
<PB N="44" REF="47">
proportion of power in the different cla&s;&s;es is natural; and a diminution of that of the upper-cla&s;s of too great magnitude, places &s;ociety in an unnatural &s;itua|tion, and draws a long train of calamities after it. For hereby the &s;pirit of &s;ubordination is undermined, and almo&s;t annihilated; and its place mu&s;t be &s;upplied by &s;omething el&s;e, to pre&s;erve public order as before: as much re&s;traint as is thus taken off from the indi|vidual, mu&s;t be added again by the coercion of new and &s;tricter laws; the increa&s;e of which is always inimi|cal to per&s;onal liberty at lea&s;t. The rigours of the municipal laws in republics, and &s;ome ill-con&s;tructed mixed governments, furni&s;h us with &s;triking ex|amples of this. It has ari&s;en from their being obliged to dimini&s;h the natural influence of ranks by artificial re&s;traints, as being inimical to the principle on which they are founded.</P>
<P>But it is not hereby meant to be maintained, that the opulent land-holders ought not to pay any ad|dititious tax; and particularly, that the amount of the tax cannot be now increa&s;ed, until it bears the &s;ame proportion to their rent, which took place in the beginning of this century; actual experience having proved the contrary: or that the landlords of one part of the kingdom cannot bear the &s;ame proportional charge as tho&s;e of the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;onings, &s;howing that the tax may ju&s;tly be increa&s;ed, are nearly of the &s;ame force to prove that it will; unle&s;s an inability of the contri|butors can be admitted, or that the State will not, for a con&s;iderable period to come, want &s;uch an aug|mentation of revenue. For whoever has con&s;idered the progre&s;s of taxation in this century, and a great part of the la&s;t, will admit, that to prove the one, is nearly to prove the other. But leaving the&s;e general topics, more particular con&s;iderations are now to be brought forward, in &s;upport of this po&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="48">Since the year 1700, the taxes paid by the other cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety have increa&s;ed in burthen, though not in the &s;ame degree as in charge; becau&s;e their annual income, in the &s;ame period, have greatly in|crea&s;ed. For if their income had remained fixed du|ring this term, and the taxes paid by them been trebled, their burthens would have been trebled: but if this income be conceived, in the &s;ame time, to have become doubled; at the end of it, every equal charge would have been borne with twice the facility; and their burthens, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing in the pro|portion of three to one, would have been augmented only in that of three to two, or become only half as much again. This illu&s;trates, though it does not give an accurate mea&s;ure of the increa&s;e of the burthen of all taxes, exclu&s;ive of that on land, on all the con|tributors during the pre&s;ent century.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if the taxes had remained fixed, and the income of the contributors had been doubled, their burthens would have been reduced one half.</P>
<P>It is in this mode, though not in the &s;ame degree, that the advances of rent has been perpetually dimi|ni&s;hing the burthen of the land-tax. The average increa&s;e of actual rent has been nearly three-fourths per cent. annually, from the year 1700 (the fir&s;t term for which an average land-tax, for peace and war, or its periodical average can be a&s;&s;igned) to the year 1792. Or, more accurately, every pound rent had, in that term, been increa&s;ed to &pound;.1&middot;9745<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 6. &sect; 9.</NOTE>. And if the tax had increa&s;ed in the &s;ame proportion, its burthen would have perpetually remained fixed. Now, in the year 1700, the periodical average of the tax (that of the city of London being excluded) was
<PB N="46" REF="49">
&pound;.1.3148ms.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 6. &sect; 8.</NOTE> and thus augmented it would have become &pound;.2.596ms.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. &sect;. 9.</NOTE> Its amount at 4s. in the pound, the nominal rate of the preceding peace, is &pound;. 1.675ms.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. &sect; 10.</NOTE> therefore, if an addition of &pound;.921,000 <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. &sect; 10.</NOTE> were now made to the tax, it would only bring the burthen of the contributors back to an equality with that of the year 1700. And here it is to be ob&s;erved, that this addition is far le&s;s than the pre&s;ent defalcation of the remote di&s;trict.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See Section 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>But as the burthens of the other cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety have continued increa&s;ing, and that with a very con|&s;iderable degree of celerity; they have a right to demand from the proprietors of land, that, by their particular tax, they would again contribute to the increa&s;ed public expence, at lea&s;t in the old propor|tion to their incomes; and that &s;ome remedy &s;hould at length, though late, be applied to a &s;y&s;tem of taxation, by which, while the proportion of their own burthen to the expence of the State is perpe|tually increa&s;ed, that of the land-tax of the opulent country gentry is perpetually dimini&s;hing: and they will add, that the experience of the beginning of the century pointed our that the land could very well bear the burthen then laid upon it. Ju&s;tice and policy redemand it; and there &s;eems a con&s;iderable probabi|lity that the demand mu&s;t be attended to.</P>
<P>For an additional argument for it, of great weight, is to be drawn from the progre&s;s of the debt, and the nece&s;&s;ity of putting a &s;top to it. This will be fully laid open in the proof of the following pro|po&s;ition: that the equalization of the land-tax will be very nearly an adequate remedy to this evil, and put it ab&s;olutely in our reach, with a &s;mall additional exertion. To demon&s;trate which, it becomes nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="47" REF="50">
to determine the amount of a &s;inking fund, which will effect this great purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent efforts to put a &s;top to the increa&s;e of the debt, although very inadequate, greatly exceed whatever were made at any former term; and form no weak pre&s;umptive proof, that we may expect from the &s;pirit of the times, and it may be ju&s;tly added of the Admini&s;tration, that when it is &s;een with what facility this fir&s;t &s;tep to &s;ecurity can be obtained, it will not be neglected.</P>
<P>We are now to proceed to the inve&s;tigation above mentioned. Omitting fractions, it may be taken, that the average length of a term of war is eight, and of peace ten years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 6. &sect; 6.</NOTE>. Nor ought it to be a&s;|&s;umed, that in future the duration of peace will ex|ceed that of war, in a greater proportion. In &s;ub|jects of &s;uch con&s;equence to a State, it is be&s;t to err on the &s;afe&s;t &s;ide; and we are to give way to no de|lu&s;ive imaginations, that the future cour&s;e of things will be better than what we have experienced in the la&s;t 100 years; for it is &s;o far back that the&s;e averages extend. The pre&s;ent <HI>&s;emi-chaotic</HI> &s;tate of Europe will not permit us to indulge in &s;uch agreeable but vi|&s;ionary expectations: and in a few months we have &s;een a new and great republic ri&s;e, the vices of who&s;e internal con&s;titution are &s;uch, that foreign wars will become nece&s;&s;ary to it, to obtain &s;ome re|&s;pite from internal commotion. This is very clearly illu&s;trated, by the con&s;equences which always at|tended the heterogeneous and di&s;cordant con&s;titution of the republic of the Romans; a much more moral people. A &s;tate of ho&s;tilities, almo&s;t continual, was the only remedy to the di&s;cord of peace: it was by foreign wars only that they enjoyed, at any time, the delu&s;ive appearance of a hollow truce at

home, with no principle of union within; the State fell to pieces, when there was no external force to compre&s;s its repul&s;ive parts together: it fell, for want of an enemy; and the tyranny of a de&s;pot &s;ucceeded the alternate tyrannies of the great and the mob. The new republic has the &s;ame di&s;orders, but in a more malignant degree; and it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es only the &s;ame terrible means, to patch up the blotches and ulcers, which its radically vitiated con&s;titution will be perpetually producing and reproducing.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations will not give us leave, e&s;pe|cially at pre&s;ent, to think the chances of the dura|tion of peace to be increa&s;ed, or tending to increa&s;e. Eighteen years is therefore here a&s;&s;igned, as the length of a period of one war and one peace taken together; as the di&s;tance from any a&s;&s;igned year of peace, to the &s;ame year in the next peace: and let it be &s;up|po&s;ed, that a term of peace, now exi&s;ting, will con|tinue five years; it will be followed by a war of eight years, of which the extraordinary expence will be taken at eighty millions. The five fir&s;t years of the following peace will complete the period: and if the debt, at the beginning and end of that period, be equal; or the capital paid off in the two halves of the terms of peace, be equal to the new capital ge|nerated by the intermediate war; the progre&s;s of the debt will be completely &s;topped, and no more.</P>
<P>The fund applicable to the di&s;charge of the debt, which will effect this purpo&s;e, may be called the ade|quate fund, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from &s;uch as &s;uffer the debt to continue to increa&s;e; and al&s;o tho&s;e who&s;e product is &s;o great, as to afford a remi&s;&s;ion of taxes under certain regulations.</P>

therein: and the capital of the debt, at its ter|mination, is preci&s;ely equal to its amount at the be|ginning. The fund, therefore, becomes what is here called an adequate fund.</P>
<P>An equalization of the land-tax, which would pro|duce a million and a &s;mall fraction annually, in ad|dition to our pre&s;ent &s;urplus, would be a very good approach to &s;uch a fund: and it may be carried into execution, without making the tax perpetual, by ve&s;ting a further part of the old &s;inking fund in the commi&s;&s;ioners, equal to the increa&s;e of the tax; and voting the latter, annually, to the current &s;ervices, to make up the deficiency in the provi&s;ion for them, which will ari&s;e from this appropriation: nothing is hereby altered of the con&s;titutional nature of a land-tax; as it continues to be voted annually, and to be applied to current &s;ervices only. It is thus indeed to be con&s;idered, as indirectly applied to the augmenta|tion of the fund: and in this &s;en&s;e, its augmentation thereby is to be always here under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The amount of an adequate &s;urplus fund being &pound;.3&middot;485 ms. a year, the exi&s;ting fund, which very little exceeds 1&frac12; million, mu&s;t be admitted to be to|tally inadequate; and if the con&s;ideration of our pre|&s;ent &s;afety does not impo&s;e upon us a nece&s;&s;ity of augmenting it in&s;tantly, the time in which that nece&s;|&s;ity &s;hall &s;peak in a more imperative tone, is not far di&s;tant; but the &s;ame exertions, at both periods, will not produce equal relief in equal times: the ultimate burthens of the State, and the time they mu&s;t con|tinue, are increa&s;ed by every delay of effectual mea|&s;ures.</P>
<P>This &s;tate of our affairs, therefore, calls for every ju&s;t and practicable addition to be made to our in|come; and an augmentation to the land-tax evidently comes under that de&s;cription.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="55">Whatever &s;hows that &s;uch a &s;acrifice, on the part of tho&s;e who ought to make it, is le&s;s than at fir&s;t &s;ight it appears, is an argument which enforces the claim upon them: it adds the whole of its proper weight to the con&s;ideration of nece&s;&s;ity; and thus increa&s;es the probability that it mu&s;t take place, though in|directly, not in a minute degree. It may be there|fore proper to be &s;hown, that, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that an adequate fund be e&s;tabli&s;hed, part of which &s;hall be effectively formed by an augmentation of this tax, it will effect the total value of the e&s;tates out of which it i&s;&s;ues, and the neat annual income of the pro|prietors, much le&s;s than at fir&s;t &s;ight it may appear to do.</P>
<P>That the &s;elling price of e&s;tates will be hereby very little, if at all, decrea&s;ed, is thus &s;hown: although their neat rents be at fir&s;t dimini&s;hed, yet, by the operation of &s;uch a fund, the rate of intere&s;t mu&s;t be much reduced; and the year's purcha&s;e of neat landed income will be increa&s;ed in the &s;ame proportion. Hence, the reduction of the market value of &s;uch e&s;tates will be ultimately incon&s;iderable: and it much concerns tho&s;e per&s;ons, on whom the augmentation of the charge of the tax will fall, well to examine, whe|ther by the application of &s;uch a fund, and the con&s;e|quent fall of intere&s;t, more may not be gotten than lo&s;t upon this head.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir John Barnard, in his celebrated e&s;&s;ay on the reduction of the intere&s;t of the Debt, in the la&s;t four lines of it, where he would have advanced nothing which in his own opinion did not &s;tand upon the be&s;t foundation, applied this argument in &s;upport of a point which &s;eems to involve a much more decided oppo&s;ition to popular belief, than that &s;tated above. Con&s;iderations, &amp;c. O&s;borne, 1750, p. 34.</NOTE></P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that the increa&s;e of the tax is an uncompen&s;ated reduction of the neat income of the landlord: but the very act of giving up a &s;mall part of it impre&s;&s;es a very &s;trong tendency upon the re|mainder
<PB N="53" REF="56">
to increa&s;e; for that increa&s;e will always be the con&s;equence of improvements of the &s;oil, or aug|mentation of demand; and both the&s;e mu&s;t follow, in a certain degree, the fall of the rate of intere&s;t. The price of improvement of land is the intere&s;t of the money &s;unk in it: and whether it be effected by the capital of the farmer or the landlord; when it be|comes cheaper, the landlords will be able to draw into their own pockets a greater proportion of the annual value of the&s;e improvements, &s;uppo&s;ing the number of &s;uch undertakings not augmented; but the increa&s;ed facility of them will likewi&s;e augment their numbers. Again, from the &s;ame common &s;ource of pro&s;perity, the traders and commercial men will become able to be better cu&s;tomers for the products of the &s;oil, or an augmentation of demand for them take place; the &s;econd pre-di&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e of an increa&s;e of rent: the joint effects of both may very &s;oon re&s;tore to the landlord no &s;mall part of what the tax initially takes from him; or he may ultimately, and at no very di&s;tant period, find his temporary &s;acrifice entirely repaid; and when the urgent nece&s;&s;ities of the State call for it, it may be expected, that the voice, even of a &s;elf-intere&s;t, very &s;lightly counterbalanced by any better principle, would be almo&s;t &s;ilent again&s;t it.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the tax be increa&s;ed, without augment|ing the appropriated &s;inking fund, there will be no tendency in its effects to reimbur&s;e the landlord for the diminution of his income: and a re&s;ource, almo&s;t &s;ufficient to ward off all the new difficulties the debt will involve us in, and in time to free us from the old, will be lo&s;t to us for ever, and leave nothing which a well-grounded hope can &s;ub&s;titute in its place.</P>
<P>Nor can it be &s;aid, that the addition to the tax thus applied, is locked up from the &s;ervice of the public, when any exigence requires it. The new
<PB N="54" REF="57">
&s;y&s;tem of the application of the &s;inking fund pre&s;erves to the State the command of its own money at all times, and under &s;uch conditions, that its alienation increa&s;es its efficacy. Thus a defect of its original in&s;titution is converted into an advantage. The pre&s;ent &s;urplus retards the increa&s;e of debt, but does not put a &s;top to it; and, without the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an adequate fund, the annual charges of the State mu&s;t continue to increa&s;e to the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive magnitude, by the increa&s;e of the public annuities. The be&s;t and rea|die&s;t &s;ource of augmentation for the fund is that of the land-tax; and the ju&s;te&s;t mode of effecting that, is by equalization: that mea&s;ure would place us in the immediate reach of the great object here treated of; for if it be once obtained, the tax which would pay the intere&s;t of the loan of a &s;ingle year of war, will make the fund adequate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The amount of the fund is &s;omething le&s;s than 3&frac12; millions.

<P>If the pre&s;ent war &s;hould not be attended with any great deficiency of the revenue, &s;uch a fund would very &s;oon be rendered adequate, by the addition of an annuity of 1l. per cent. on all loans, to its amount.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>The average nominal rate of the tax, in four &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive terms of peace, ending with that of 1763, was
<PB N="55" REF="58">
31.955<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 6. &sect; 1. Table.</NOTE> pence; and of the four la&s;t terms of war, 4s. in the pound: and we may look on the e&s;tabli&s;hed proportion of its charge in war and peace to be as the numbers 48, and 31.955, re&s;pectively. Thus its nominal rate, during the pre&s;ent peace, having been uniformly 4s. in the pound, in the next war it will exceed &s;ix &s;hillings by a &s;mall fraction, and the addi|tion to its annual charge become &pound;.1.011,381: and it may be ob&s;erved here, as on a former occa&s;ion, that it will be &s;een in the next Section, that if the whole of this addition be levied, exclu&s;ively, upon the remote di&s;trict, it will &s;till contribute to this tax le&s;s than its proportional charge.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e arguments, deduced from the nature of a land-tax, the equity of the mea&s;ure, and the &s;tate of our finances, to &s;how that an augmentation of amount is very probable; &s;everal authorities to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame point might be doubtle&s;s found by any per&s;on who &s;hould &s;earch for them. At the con|clu&s;ion of the late war, and during the term at the beginning of the pre&s;ent peace, in which a &s;ettled gloom &s;eemed to hang over us, &s;ome &s;ober and tem|perate men began to declare their opinions of the nece&s;&s;ity of its augmentation. Baron Ma&s;eres, who certainly applied him&s;elf with much ability and atten|tion to inve&s;tigate the effects of the &s;inking fund, on &s;everal capitals of our heterogeneous ma&s;s of debt, concludes his re&s;earches, by affirming, that it would become nece&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e the land-tax, if the revenue &s;hould fall &s;hort two millions of what the exigencies of the State might require; and he takes it for granted, that &s;uch an addition to our income would be wanted. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ma&s;eres, 1783. page 448.</NOTE>'There is rea&s;on,' &s;ays this writer, <Q>to apprehend, that it will be nece&s;&s;ary not only to continue the land-tax at 4s. in the pound, but even

<P>Though the opinion of Baron Ma&s;eres, that the amount of the land-tax will probably be doubled, when a new nece&s;&s;ity &s;hall call for an increa&s;e of the public revenue, may be di&s;puted; yet a le&s;s augmen|tation would &s;everally affect the intere&s;ts of the home counties: and whenever again we &s;hall be engaged in a war, a great addition mu&s;t be made to it. The opinions long &s;ince advanced by men of eminence will then form the general &s;entiment, and be carried into effect: and it is probable, that if the pre&s;ent valuation be continued, the nominal rate will be about &s;ix &s;hillings in the pound, for the rea&s;on given above. I know very well, that there is much ridicule fre|quently attached to the &s;uppo&s;ition, that plans of &s;peculative men, buried in the du&s;t of a library, will ever influence the important tran&s;actions of the poli|tical world, or produce events on which the fate of great cla&s;&s;es of men, or even great nations, &s;hall de|pend; and that to con&s;ider, and be prepared before|hand, as to what part we &s;hall act, when we &s;ee &s;uch &s;cenes to be approaching, is &s;omething even beneath the folly and dotage of timidity.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION IV.</HI> On the Mea&s;ure of the Di&s;proportion of the Charge of the Land-Tax, on the Home and Remote Di&s;tricts, and its Con&s;equences.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fir&s;t Section it was &s;tated, that the kingdom is, with re&s;pect to the land-tax, to be con&s;idered as &s;eparated into two great divi&s;ions; the home di&s;trict comprehending the 11 home counties, with that of Middle&s;ex, all con&s;ideration of London being here excluded; and the remainder of England and Wales, called the remote di&s;trict. It is generally known, that the land-tax upon the home di&s;trict much exceeds its due proportion, as determined by the annual rent of each. The mea&s;ure of that exce&s;s is fir&s;t to be made the &s;ubject of con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The proportion of the contents, or number of acres of each di&s;trict, is very nearly known: but, if the value or fee &s;imple<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Accurately &s;peaking, e&s;tates of equal value only &s;hould be charged with equal taxes, not tho&s;e of equal income. Hence a rent proportioned to the fee &s;imple of a di&s;trict, not the actual in|come thereof, will be the mea&s;ure of its taxability: but this di|&s;tinction (which had been apparently adopted by Mr. King) is much le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary upon this &s;ubject than I had at fir&s;t imagined. It will be found, however, to have been ob&s;erved throughout this E&s;&s;ay. Though di&s;tinctions with but little difference ought not generally to be made, yet, when they are once interwoven in a tract, there may be much trouble in blotting out all the traces of them; and it will on the whole be only a negative correction.</NOTE> of each be taken as its contents, that of the remote di&s;trict will be &s;tated too high. Again, the number of hou&s;es in each, at the Revo|lution, is known with &s;ufficient accuracy: and the remote divi&s;ion has relatively increa&s;ed in population ever &s;ince, to a great degree. It has likewi&s;e, in the
<PB N="61" REF="64">
&s;ame term, increa&s;ed in manufactures with a much greater celerity than the home divi&s;ion. If therefore the taxable value of the di&s;tricts be computed from the proportion of their population in 1688, that of the remote di&s;trict will be con&s;iderably le&s;s than the truth. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, there will be an error of exce&s;s in its value, and in the &s;econd, of defect: and it is here a&s;&s;umed, that the&s;e errors counterbalance each other: hence it is determined, that the value of the home is to that of the remote di&s;trict, as 10,000 to 31,814.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 1. &sect; 13. And it is evident, that this is the pro|portion of their taxable income.</NOTE> The proportion of their values is all that is here required to be found, as it &s;erves the &s;ame purpo&s;es, in the pre&s;ent inquiry, as their ab&s;olute amounts, if known.</P>
<P>By other independent methods it is found, that this proportion is &s;ufficiently near the truth; and they afford collateral &s;upport to it.</P>
<P>Davenant, in his e&s;&s;ay on Ways and Means, written in 1695, lays it down, that the remote counties were then to be e&s;teemed and valued as three fourths of the kingdom. In the fir&s;t Section it is fully &s;hown how much their value has relatively increa&s;ed &s;ince: it is matter of common notoriety. If therefore, when the rent of the home divi&s;ion is taken as 10,000, that of this di&s;trict be taken as 31,814, the latter may &s;eem rather to be le&s;s than greater than the truth. The land-tax paid by the home di&s;trict (London excluded) is &pound;.652,275:<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 1. &sect; 17.</NOTE> and according to the proportion here given, the remote di&s;trict ought to pay &pound;.2,075,100:<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 1. &sect; 17.</NOTE> the real payment thereof is &pound;.1,038,184,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 1. &sect; 17.</NOTE> which falls &s;hort of its equitable and ju&s;t contribution, &pound;.1,036,916.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 1. &sect; 17.</NOTE> This defalcation may be &s;tated in another point of view: thus its proportional payment
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Davenant, v. 1. p. 46.</NOTE>
<PB N="62" REF="65">
being &pound;.10,000, its effective charge is &pound;.5002 only: and for every &s;um of &pound;.10,000 thus paid, the ju&s;t charge amounts to &pound;.19,989.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now inquire, what is the effective charge of this tax in the pound, upon the actual income of real e&s;tates, in the two di&s;tricts, when the nominal charge on each is four &s;hillings.</P>
<P>The income of &s;uch e&s;tates is of two kinds; rent of &s;uperior condition, as rent of land; or of inferior condition, as that of buildings and mines. The &s;um of each of the&s;e is ordinarily &s;tated as the national rent; and may properly be called a mixed rent, on account of the nature of the &s;ubjects out of which it ari&s;es. The market values of all the e&s;tates of two di&s;tricts of con&s;iderable extent may not be as their incomes, the rate of intere&s;t being in each the &s;ame; becau&s;e one may contain a greater proportion of rents of the inferior condition than the other. Hence the ability of &s;uch a divi&s;ion of a country to contribute to a land-tax, will not always be in the preci&s;e pro|portion of its mixed income, but of its &s;elling price: or, which is the &s;ame thing, it will be as the annual rent of &s;upeior condition, which might be purcha&s;ed for that price. To determine the proportion of the ability of the landlords of a di&s;trict to pay any tax, its mixed income ought to be &s;o reduced; a transfor|mation which is employed in other parts of this in|quiry: but we are now to find the proportion the actual tax bears to the actual income, that is, the mixed income; the law by which it is impo&s;ed, bear|ing no re&s;pect to the nature of the &s;ubject out of which any rent ari&s;es.</P>
<P>Excluding London, the mixed rent of both di&s;tricts, in 1792, amounted to &pound;.25.525 ms.; and that of the home di&s;trict, to &pound;.6.104 ms. And the land-tax on this part of the kingdom being &pound;.652,200, the charge in the pound was 2<HI>s.</HI> 1 2/4<HI>d.</HI> very nearly. The rent in

<P>Be&s;ide the peculiar tax paid by the landlords, a part of all other taxes is paid out of their income or rents; and as the&s;e do, or may, affect all income in general, from whatever &s;ource derived, they are here called general taxes. Now the part paid out of the rents of the two di&s;tricts, is to their whole charge, as that rent to the whole national income: hence the amount of the&s;e general taxes being &pound;.15.162 ms.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 7. &sect; 3.</NOTE>, their charge upon the provincial proprietors of land is &pound;.4.1827 ms. or 3<HI>s.</HI> 3&frac13;<HI>d.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Preceding Table.</NOTE> in the pound rent.</P>

<P>The con&s;equence of this di&s;parity, to the kingdom in general, and the home di&s;trict in particular, offer them&s;elves next to our examination. The fir&s;t branch of the&s;e con&s;iderations will be entered upon by the proof of the following propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>If the remote di&s;trict had con&s;tantly contributed in their ju&s;t proportion to this tax, and the &s;um by which it would have been thereby increa&s;ed, had been ap|plied to the purcha&s;e of 3 per cent. &s;tock; it would at this time have extingui&s;hed a capital, nearly dou|ble that of the pre&s;ent redeemable debt, after a due and even liberal allowance had been made for the dif|ficulties that part of the kingdom laboured under, at the Revolution, and perhaps for &s;ome following years.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="68">The average nominal rate of the tax, &s;ince its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, has been 3s. and 3 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">/8d. in the pound, very nearly;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pence, 39.114.</NOTE> and its annual average product in Eng|land, &pound;.1.6116. Now, its actual charge to the re|mote counties is to that on the whole kingdom, as 1.0381 to 1.9777.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Davenant, v. 1. p. 39 (Table).</NOTE> Therefore, the annual average charge upon them has been &pound;.845.930: but that actual charge is to the proportional charge, as 10.000 to 19,989. The amount of the latter would have therefore been &pound;.1.690,990. The difference of the&s;e two payments, or &pound;.845.060 is the fund, which would thus have been applicable to the reduction of the 3 per cent. capital.</P>
<P>The term of its operation is next to be fixed; and in a&s;&s;igning it, due allowance is to be made for the di&s;tre&s;s under which it has been &s;een that the remote di&s;trict laboured at the Revolution, and for &s;ome years after. It was above &s;hewn, that in the year 1729, all traces of the former depre&s;&s;ion of the value of e&s;tates in the di&s;trict had become obliterated, or 36 years after the impo&s;ition of the tax: but at the very beginning of the term, the payment of the re|mote counties was greatly below their abilities of contributing to the public charges: and it may be taken, that their e&s;tates ro&s;e to an equality of value with tho&s;e of the home di&s;trict, by equal degrees, in equal times: and if their fir&s;t payment, which was &s;o inadequate, had been fully proportioned to their ability at that time, by the nature of their progre&s;&s;ive recovery, as above de&s;cribed; if they had paid the full tax the la&s;t half of the term, or 18 years, and their initial a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments without increa&s;e, for the fir&s;t half thereof; a due allowance would have been made for their temporary di&s;tre&s;s: but in the circum&s;tances which took place, this allowance is much more than
<PB N="66" REF="69">
adequate. From the whole term of a century, there|fore, the period during which the land-tax has ex|i&s;ted, 18 years is to be deducted; and the re|mainder, 82 years, is the period in which the fund of &pound;. 845,060 (to have been gained by the equalization of the tax) would have been applicable to the extinc|tion of the debt.</P>
<P>The third factor to be a&s;&s;igned, is the rate of inte|re&s;t at which the fund would have operated in &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive periodical publications. We have the price of the 3 per cent. &s;tocks from the year 1731 inclu&s;ive, to this time; and taking, as before, the average inte|re&s;t of the &s;tock market, during the pre&s;ent peace, at &pound;. 4, that of the la&s;t 62 years was &pound;.3&middot;562 per cent.: during the fir&s;t 20 years of this term, that rate was &s;till higher; but the permanent rate here a&s;&s;umed is &pound;. 3&frac12; per cent. It is to be noted, that hereby the amount of the fund for the whole term will not be incon&s;iderably le&s;s than the truth; the intere&s;t at which it would have accumulated in the fir&s;t 20, and the la&s;t 10 years, having exceeded &pound;. 3&frac12; per cent.</P>
<P>The amount of an annuity of &pound;. 1 in 82 years, at &pound;.3&frac12; per cent. is &pound;.451&middot;20; and of an annuity of &pound;.845,060, &pound;.381&middot;29 ms. And intere&s;t being at &pound;.3&frac12;, or the value of the 3 per cents. &pound;.855/7; that &s;um of money would have extingui&s;hed a capital of &pound;.444&middot;83 ms. of &s;uch &s;tock.</P>
<P>Nor can it be &s;aid, from the experience of the fate of our &s;inking fund, that &s;uch an additional &s;um, if put under the like appropriation, would not have been applied for that purpo&s;e; for, during the pre&s;ent cen|tury, the mean annual expences, and the charge of the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, have increa&s;ed very nearly in the &s;ame proportion. And this &s;eems to be derived from a nece&s;&s;ity, impo&s;ed upon every member of the European republic of States, which will not &s;ubmit to be degraded below its former relative rank therein;
<PB N="67" REF="70">
which is founded on great advances in &s;trength and opulence, which mo&s;t of them have made in the pre&s;ent age. By an unfortunate &s;y&s;tem of policy, the nation has never provided an increa&s;ing revenue for this increa&s;ing charge; and thus the product of the &s;inking fund has at length been almo&s;t totally ab&s;orbed by the increa&s;ing charge of the peace e&s;ta|bli&s;hment. The errors, and perhaps the delinquence of Admini&s;trations, may at &s;ome periods have contri|buted toward it; but this impolitic national par&s;imony, much more: nor are the marks of criminal profu&s;e|ne&s;s, which appear upon the face of the public accounts, &s;o frequent in the middle and at the con|clu&s;ion of the la&s;t hundred years, as at the beginning: and perhaps no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, to &s;how, that, if the amount of the &s;inking fund had been &pound;.850,000 a year more, this &s;urplus would have been gra|tuitou&s;ly flung away; and if only one half of it had e&s;caped from the influence of peculation and mi&s;ma|nagement, our pre&s;ent debt would have been nearly annihilated.</P>
<P>But the inequality of the land-tax has likewi&s;e con|tributed its &s;hare to another great evil: it was not without its effect, and that perhaps a very con&s;iderable one, in producing the civil war of the colonies, and di&s;membering the empire: for it cannot be doubted, that a &s;u&s;picion of the equity with which the Briti&s;h Parliament would exerci&s;e the power of taxation, was one of the leading cau&s;es which brought on the re&s;i&s;t|ance, which terminated in that great revolution. And if no other American made up his opinion on this head, from the di&s;parity of the land-tax of England, Dr. Franklin at lea&s;t did. <Q>He always u&s;ed to quote the continuance of the land-tax, upon its pre&s;ent very unequal footing, as a proof of the very little regard that was had to ju&s;tice and common-&s;en&s;e,
<PB N="68" REF="71">
in our national deliberations.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ma&s;eres, on Life Annuities, p. 450.</NOTE> This argument mu&s;t have full weight with tho&s;e who think the coloni&s;ts would have concurred in any mode of con|tributing to the expences of the united empire; which they were a&s;&s;ured, from the e&s;tabli&s;hed character of equity in the legi&s;lation, would not have been attended with practical oppre&s;&s;ion and inequality: for they would not have hazarded a civil war, for ab&s;tract principles, when they had a &s;ufficient moral proba|bility, grounded on their confidence of the long unimpeachable ju&s;tice of that a&s;&s;embly, in whom the power would be, that the&s;e ab&s;tract principles would never produce an additional burthen to them in their operation; and, on the other hand, temperaments would have been ea&s;ily di&s;covered, and conceded to with the &s;ame facility, to have obtained their con|tributions, without any contravention to tho&s;e prin|ciples.</P>
<P>The effects of this inequality, upon the home di|&s;trict in particular, are now to be &s;tated. Here it will not be &s;ufficient to examine &s;imply the force by which the&s;e counties are depre&s;&s;ed: for its con&s;e|quences depend, not only on its magnitude, but on the &s;trength of the &s;ubject on which it operates: therefore, after di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the general effects of the di&s;parity, other circum&s;tances are to be pointed out, which, operating in conjunction with them, tend greatly to increa&s;e the relative depre&s;&s;ion of the di|&s;trict.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the ab&s;olute definition of the property of the the home di&s;trict, by the di&s;proportionate a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of the tax, as a &s;econdary con&s;equence, it produces an effective, and a very important balance of pay|ment, again&s;t the le&s;s, and in favour of the greater divi&s;ion of the kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="72">When money is brought by taxes into the trea&s;ury, much of it again returns into the country, for &s;everal purpo&s;es; to pay the intere&s;t of the public creditors; for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of troops, the purcha&s;e of &s;tores and commodities; and on divers other accounts. Now it may very well be admitted, &s;ums &s;o returned into the two di&s;tricts, are as the landed capital of each: the &s;um of the&s;e di&s;bur&s;ements in both will evidently exceed &pound;.1&middot;6903 ms.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 4.</NOTE>, the amount of the provincial tax: but fir&s;t let it be con&s;idered as exactly equal thereto, being di&s;tributed to both in the proportion laid down.

That we may judge of its con&s;e|&s;equence, let its amount be compared with that part of our annual gain by foreign trade, which pre&s;ents it&s;elf fir&s;t to every one's imagination, who thinks upon the increa&s;e of national opulence: I mean that part of the precious metals gained by the general balance of trade, which forms the annual increment of our national &s;tock of coin. That we have, on an average of many years, an annual re&s;ting balance of this kind, notwith|&s;tanding the great diminution of corn which mu&s;t be occa&s;ioned by our wars, and the more latent cau&s;es of decrea&s;e, will not, I think, at this time, be brought into di&s;pute. Now the larger this &s;um is &s;tated to be, the le&s;s will the comparative lo&s;s of the home di&s;trict appear, from the adver&s;e balance above pointed out. In 1750, Mr. Andrew Hooke publi&s;hed his E&s;&s;ay on the National Debt and Capital; which is mentioned by Sir John Sinclair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir J. Sinclair's Hi&s;tory of the Revenue, v. 2. p. 118.

The great foundation on which all his computations are built, is the annual increment of the national coin: this he &s;tates at &pound;.164,772<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hooke's E&s;&s;ay, p. 6. In this he &s;eems to have exceeded the truth. It appears from a pa&s;&s;age in Dr. A.

Thus the balance again&s;t the home di&s;trict, generated by the inequality of land-tax, exceeds the part of our foreign balance of trade, by which the coin of the kingdom is increa&s;ed, by &pound;.83,198, being more than one half thereof.</P>
<P>This annual increment of the coin of &pound;.164,000 a year, is the ba&s;is on which the increment of our cur|rency
<PB N="71" REF="74">
is founded; which is the &s;um of our circulating paper and coin; for a part of this new coin being withdrawn, and locked up in the che&s;t of the banker, enables him to increa&s;e the currency by three or four times its amount in paper: and thus the market for all our commodities is &s;upplied with the repre&s;enta|tive &s;igns of real value, although both their quantities and their nominal prices are perpetually augmenting. This apparently minute annual increment of the na|tional &s;tock of coin, is the &s;tream that has led the national capital, in every &s;tage of its progre&s;&s;ive growth; and it is &s;ufficient to have increa&s;ed it to that magnitude it has attained. The inequality of the land-tax, which has generated a balance again&s;t the home di&s;trict of &pound;.247,000 a year, mu&s;t have greatly retarded it in its cour&s;e of pro&s;perity, during the whole term it has operated: although the counties included in it, &s;hould be admitted to have derived an equal, or perhaps a &s;uperior &s;um, annually from &s;ome other quarter; for even in this latter ca&s;e, a part of that annual &s;uperlucration of the di&s;trict, equal to this balance, would be annihilated by it, or would be rendered what has been called a <HI>lucrum ce&s;&s;ans;</HI> which is always in effect equal to a <HI>damnum emergens.</HI></P>
<P>In the proce&s;s to determine the adver&s;e balance again&s;t the home counties, by the inequality of the tax, it has been &s;hown, that its amount upon the pro|vinces, when its nominal rate is 4s. in the pound (a charge now become permanent) is &pound;.1.6903 ms.: of which &s;um, the proportional &s;hare of the remote di|&s;trict is &pound;.1.2863 ms.; and of the home di&s;trict, &pound;.404,300. I &s;hall here &s;o far make a digre&s;&s;ion, as to draw a corollary from this, connected with the general &s;ubject, though not with the particular matter of this Section.</P>
<P>Hence a method is ea&s;ily deduced, to equalize the burthen of the tax, and &s;till retain the old valuation of
<PB N="72" REF="75">
the di&s;tricts, and this may be done by adopting a counter-inequality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is not the deci&s;ive counter-inequality of Dr. Franklin, to be de&s;cribed hereafter: though I borrow the term from him, he annexed a much more effective notion to it.</NOTE> of the nominal rates at which the two di&s;tricts are a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;o adju&s;ted as to be reciprocal to the inequality of the valuation; by which the pay|ment of each di&s;trict is rendered proportional to its value. The new rates are found thus: the product of the tax on both remaining fixed at its pre&s;ent amount, the proportional contribution of the remote di&s;trict is &pound;.1.286 ms.: now, at the nominal rate of 4s. in the pound, the &s;um rai&s;ed therein is &pound;.1.0381 ms; and at the nominal rate of (59.455d. &equals;4s. 11&frac12;d.) 5s. in the pound, the total collected by the divi&s;ion would amount to that proportional pay|ment.</P>
<P>Again, at the nominal rate of 4s. in the pound, the &s;um of &pound;.652,270 is rai&s;ed in the home counties; the valuation of which being continued, and that reduced to (29.752 pence or 2s. 5&frac34;d.) half-a-crown in the pound, the amount of the tax would be reduced to &pound;.404,333; its proportional part of the total now paid by both.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to hold out a very ea&s;y mode of doing an act of &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice to the oppre&s;&s;ed di&s;trict; and, at the &s;ame time, of avoiding the natural diffi|culties, and the artificial ob&s;tructions which might be flung in the way of a new valuation: but the gro&s;s inequality being thus removed, the great ma&s;s of in|tere&s;t, which oppo&s;es the introduction of a more per|fect &s;y&s;tem of levying this tax, would be much re|duced, if it did not fall with it: and in a little time, every &s;ubordinate inequality would follow the fate of the great one, which at pre&s;ent covers and protects them all.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="76">To return to the immediate &s;ubject of the Section: The burthen of this di&s;parity on the home di&s;trict has been con&s;idered in &s;ome material points of view; but if all of them had been exhau&s;ted, only one half the inquiry is fini&s;hed. The mea&s;ure of the power which is to &s;upport that burthen, remains to be &s;ought after; and this power may be con&s;idered either ab&s;olutely or relatively.</P>
<P>Now there are &s;ome natural circum&s;tances re&s;pect|ing the two di&s;tricts, who&s;e primary and &s;econdary effects nece&s;&s;arily give a great &s;uperiority to the remote divi&s;ion: it includes the coal countries; the direct and primary con&s;equence of which (the wood in the home di&s;trict being reduced to almo&s;t nothing) is to form another balance of payment in their favour. But the &s;econdary effects of this natural inequality of the di&s;tricts, in re&s;pect to firing, extend much fur|ther: it lays the manufactures of the one under great di&s;advantages; and gives a &s;uperior facility to the exten&s;ion of tho&s;e of the other: in the home di&s;trict it has the mo&s;t hurtful effect on the morals and indu&s;try of the labourers in agriculture: and while, from the increa&s;e of its coal trade, and that of its manufactures, the &s;hipping of the remote divi&s;ion has received a great augmentation, that of the home di&s;trict has &s;uffered a cotemporary decline; and each in a degree which, prior to actual experience, would have been held far to exceed any bounds of probable expectation. This &s;ource of &s;uperiority, derived from nature on the one &s;ide, and of relative depre&s;&s;ion on the other, are the mo&s;t cogent arguments again&s;t &s;uffering the continu|ance of any other di&s;parities, generated by artificial and inequitable &s;y&s;tems of policy; &s;uch as the conti|nuation of a tax of double burthen upon the di&s;trict, in the le&s;s fortunate natural &s;tate.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t con&s;ider more in particular each of the&s;e circum&s;tances, which add to the weight of this unju&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="77">
burthen: their importance to the general argument is &s;uch, that they are not to be pa&s;&s;ed over in a bare &s;ummary enumeration.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the balance again&s;t the home di&s;trict by the coal trade, it may be &s;aid, <Q>that if their wood be cleared off the &s;oil, it is becau&s;e they find their gain more by reducing it into cultivation: hence they are able to pay for their coal, and afterward derive a greater profit from their land than before.</Q> To this it mu&s;t be an&s;wered, that the whole advan|tage it might reap, if they could obtain their firing out of the bowels of their own &s;oil, is dimini&s;hed by the price of the coal remitted out of the di&s;trict; and that land brought into cultivation in the other divi&s;ion occa&s;ions no drain of money for firing: on the con|trary, they keep that whole &s;um at home; and their capital is perpetually increa&s;ing, by the expence of their neighbours in this article, for the price of the coal and its freight.</P>
<P>The expence of this fuel to the con&s;umers in the home counties, con&s;i&s;ts of the following parts: its value at the pit; a duty of "more than &s;ixty per cent." on that value<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith, v. 3. p. 338 and 339.</NOTE>; the freight; mercantile pro|fit; and inland carriage. Firing is nece&s;&s;ary for the <Q>comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of many different &s;orts of workmen, who work within doors</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith, v. 3. p. 338 and 339.</NOTE>: and manu|facturers have always gradually migrated into countries where fuel is cheape&s;t, when there has been no great di&s;parity of other circum&s;tances. To this cau&s;e the de|pre&s;&s;ion of many branches of the manufactures of the home di&s;trict is to be a&s;cribed, which formerly flouri&s;hed there: and that part of the kingdom may have long occa&s;ion to regret the lo&s;s of the bill brought into the lower hou&s;e by the pre&s;ent mini&s;ter, a few years ago, laying a tax on coal at the pit's mouth. If it had
<PB N="75" REF="78">
been withdrawn on being carried coa&s;twi&s;e, it would have formed an equalizing and protecting duty, and given &s;ome remedy to its natural di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>If this difference of &s;ituation affect the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of one cla&s;s of the labouring poor in the home di|&s;trict &mdash; the manufacturers, and attack the very exi&s;tence of the manufactures them&s;elves; it produces effects no le&s;s fatal to the morals and indu&s;try of an|other&mdash;the workmen in hu&s;bandry. Before wood was almo&s;t extirpated there, the labourer could purcha&s;e firing; or, as it was of little value, much was given him: its &s;carcity has dimini&s;hed very much, if not annihilated, this &s;upply from the liberality or &s;uffe|rance of his &s;uperiors; and its price renders him more ready to &s;teal, than able to buy. He goes out in the night in &s;earch of it; and opportunities frequently pre&s;ent them&s;elves to him, at the &s;ame time, of ma|king other depredations: and the wood-&s;tealer is thus tempted to become, and frequently does become, a robber of a &s;till more dangerous character. This is one great inductive cau&s;e of that profligacy which the poor are arrived at in the home di&s;trict; and from which I conclude, that cheapne&s;s of firing has greatly tended to pre&s;erve tho&s;e of the remote divi&s;ion. It is well known how much the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of a country depends upon the morals of the lower cla&s;s: and in the home di&s;trict there is every cau&s;e in action to bring them into a &s;tate of degeneracy which can operate in the remainder of the kingdom, with almo&s;t an additional nece&s;&s;ity impo&s;ed upon them, by the dearne&s;s of fuel, of beginning the practice of night &s;tealing.</P>
<P>The la&s;t di&s;parity of the two divi&s;ions to be treated, is in the quantity of their &s;hipping; that of the home di&s;trict having decrea&s;ed with great rapidity, while that of the other has been con&s;tantly and greatly aug|menting.</P>

<P>The &s;hipping of the out-ports, are here only to be taken into the account; excluding that of the port of London.

Thus if the&s;e ports had been able to pre&s;erve their &s;hipping, without augmenting it a &s;ingle ton, the increa&s;e of our ve&s;&s;els for com|merce, and our naval force (great as it actually was) would have been doubled: and half the augmenta|tion of our marine &s;trength, from the pro&s;perity of the five great ports, was annihilated by the decline of the &s;maller taken conjointly.</P>
<P>Having &s;tated the ab&s;olute lo&s;s, the celerity of this decline is now to be fixed. Taking therefore the tonnage of the &s;maller out-ports in 1750, as 1000; that of 1772 will be found to be as 5926:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 10. &sect; 4.</NOTE> or they had lo&s;t &frac25; of their whole &s;hipping in twenty-two years.

<P>Although no extracts of regi&s;ters can be here pro|duced, to &s;how upon which of the &s;maller ports the whole of this calamity fell, yet every general rea&s;on points out, that the total of it is exclu&s;ively to be carried to the account of tho&s;e of the home di&s;trict;
<PB N="78" REF="81">
the increa&s;e of &s;hipping of &s;ome of the &s;maller ports of the other divi&s;ion, at lea&s;t counterbalancing, pro|bably much exceeding &s;ome decrea&s;e, which might be experienced by others: becau&s;e tho&s;e cau&s;es, then known to exi&s;t in this kingdom, adequate to the pro|duction of &s;o great an evil, or even capable of re&s;train|ing a cour&s;e of pro&s;perity, were limited in their ope|ration to the home di&s;trict exclu&s;ively. For although that di&s;trict, be&s;ide its di&s;proportionate charge to the State by the land-tax, is further exhau&s;ted by paying an annual balance to the other counties, which this fir&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion draws after it, as its nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence (a balance which con&s;iderably exceeds the annual increment of the national coin) there is &s;u|peradded to this, a &s;econd and much greater, on ac|count of coal: and the &s;carcity of fuel, which has thus rendered the home di&s;trict tributary to the re&s;t of the kingdom, is a circum&s;tance, which has gene|rated much depravity in the village poor; laid a new tax upon the productions of agriculture; and tended, not a little, to retard its improvements, and the in|crea&s;e of its products. And to the effect of the &s;ame cau&s;e is further to be added, that by promoting the migration of &s;ome of our manufacturers, and re&s;train|ing the extent of others, it has produced the &s;ame melancholy con&s;equences on the labouring inhabitants of our greater towns and cities, as on tho&s;e of the villages; increa&s;ing the pre&s;&s;ure of their nece&s;&s;ities; and, by perpetual intermi&s;&s;ions of employment, relax|ing their habits of indu&s;try, and giving birth to, or increa&s;ing tho&s;e of the wor&s;t nature.</P>
<P>In this account are to be found, proximate as well as remote cau&s;es of de&s;truction of commerce, and the con&s;equent decrea&s;e of &s;hipping: the&s;e having ex|i&s;ted exclu&s;ively in the home di&s;trict, the whole of their effect mu&s;t have taken place there. And it ap|pears highly probable, that the account above given,
<PB N="79" REF="82">
does not &s;how the whole of their lo&s;s in &s;hipping: for, from their natural and artificial advantages, it &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to admit, that the &s;maller ports of the remote divi&s;ion taken collectively have made &s;ome increa&s;e to their tonnage; counterbalancing in part the decrea&s;e of the others. This rate of augmen|tation may certainly be taken equal to that of the ave|rage increa&s;e of the national &s;hipping, as retarded by the lo&s;&s;es of the home di&s;trict; for their advantages are above the general average; and it may with the greate&s;t moderation be a&s;&s;umed, that as the four great out-ports, all &s;ituated in the remote di&s;trict, have in twenty-two years increa&s;ed in tonnage, in the propor|tion of 18122, to 10000,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 10. &sect; 4.</NOTE> &s;o that of the other ports alike &s;ituated, and partaking the &s;ame common advan|tages, have, in the &s;ame time, increa&s;ed in the pro|portion of 11755 to 10000 (which is the average rate of increa&s;e of the tonnage of the whole kingdom) or with &s;omething le&s;s than one fourth of the celerity of the former.</P>
<P>But if it be contended that even this rate is too much, let the tonnage of the&s;e &s;maller ports, taken col|lectively, be now admitted to have increa&s;ed with any celerity, le&s;s that here mentioned: the augment it has received mu&s;t be &s;omething; and the decrea&s;e of the tonnage of all the &s;maller ports of the kingdom, taken together, will have been dimini&s;hed by that in|crea&s;e: therefore the decrea&s;e of that of the other ports, that is, tho&s;e of the home di&s;trict, will be equal to the total decrea&s;e of this tonnage, 107,574 tons, with that &s;mall augment added to it. The decrea&s;e of their &s;hipping therefore, as above repre&s;ented, is le&s;s than the truth: whence it follows, that the celerity of its decline is much le&s;s than the truth. For in 1750, the tonnage cleared outwards from the &s;mall
<PB N="80" REF="83">
home ports, mu&s;t have been le&s;s than 264,073 tons,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 10. &sect; 4.</NOTE> the total for both di&s;tricts: its decrea&s;e al&s;o exceeded 107,574 tons. Hence, by the nature of proportion, it mu&s;t have decrea&s;ed from the year 1750 to 1772, with a greater celerity, than that defined by the ratio of 264,073 tons, to 156,499 tons, or of 10000 to 5926.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 10. &sect; 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>If the &s;hipping of &s;maller remote ports be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;tationary, neither increa&s;ing nor dimi|ni&s;hing; the decrea&s;e of the annual tonnage of the &s;maller home ports will remain as fir&s;t &s;tated: but, from the nature of proportion, the celerity of their decline, as given above, will be below its true mag|nitude.</P>
<P>There is one ca&s;e indeed, in which the celerity of the decline of the &s;hipping of the home di&s;trict, will be accurately defined by that proportion, that is, if one equal decrea&s;e had taken place, at the &s;ame time, in the remote divi&s;ion. But this &s;uppo&s;ition is extremely improbable; for it may be pre&s;umed, that, in the hi&s;to|ry of commerce, there is not to be found an in&s;tance of a great di&s;trict, which had once acquired a con|&s;iderable quantity of &s;hipping, if it had not lo&s;t its indu&s;try, or did not labour under any particular cir|cum&s;tances of adver&s;ity, where that &s;hipping was found to have been decrea&s;ing, in long terms of time. It has always been progre&s;&s;ive throughout Europe in general, where the exi&s;tence of &s;uch cau&s;es to retard it have not been extremely evident.</P>
<P>Laying now a&s;ide, all further con&s;ideration of the ab&s;olute quantity of its decrea&s;e; it is to be ob&s;erved, that the celerity of the decline of the &s;hipping of the &s;maller home ports, can be exaggerated by the e&s;timate given above, upon one &s;uppo&s;ition only: and that is, that a more rapid decline has taken place in
<PB N="81" REF="84">
the &s;maller ports of the other, in a time when every cau&s;e of &s;uperiority was operating in their favour: an a&s;&s;umption too ab&s;urd to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>It is concluded hence, that the decrea&s;e of the &s;hipping of the &s;maller home ports, and the celerity of its decline, great as it is repre&s;ented above, rather falls &s;hort of, than exceeds the truth; and that, al|though this point is e&s;tabli&s;hed only upon general rea&s;oning, which is certainly inferior in conclu&s;ivene&s;s to the proof ari&s;ing from actual regi&s;ters of tonnage, yet the&s;e general rea&s;ons have great cogency, are founded upon well-known facts; and there appears nothing of the like kind to be &s;et again&s;t them, to ba|lance them; and they can only be &s;et a&s;ide, by the production of copies of the entries of &s;uch regi&s;ters.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, <Q>that the &s;tate of the &s;hipping of England may have been very much altered, be|tween the year 1772 and this time; and that the &s;maller home ports may have recovered in a great part their relative proportion.</Q> Now, on an ave|rage of three years, ending in 1774, the tonnage of all our &s;hips in foreign commerce was 979,263 tons;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chalmers's Opinions on intere&s;ting Subjects. 1784. p. 99.</NOTE> and in the like term, ending in 1783, 933,785 tons.

It is be&s;ide to be added, that tho&s;e cau&s;es which produced the de|crea&s;e of &s;hipping from 1750 to 1772, mu&s;t have been &s;ince removed, before its progre&s;s could have been even &s;topped; and a much greater change mu&s;t have taken place, before their antecedent effect could

have been in any degree recovered. Of either of the&s;e great revolutions, no &s;ingle ve&s;tige has occurred to me.</P>
<P>The proportional payment of the home di&s;trict to the and-tax is, &pound;2&middot;075,100:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 1. &sect; 17.</NOTE> and its effective pay|ment being &pound;1,038,184, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 1. &sect; 17.</NOTE> the defalcation amounts to &pound;1,036,916.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 1. &sect; 17.</NOTE> I therefore now proceed to &s;how, that it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the full ability to make up that deficiency.</P>
<P>This might be in general terms inferred, from the great increa&s;e of the commerce of that part of the kingdom, ju&s;t before in&s;tanced; but it may be more directly proved, from particular and independent evidence, that, after &s;uch augmentation of the tax, their burthen would not be equal to that of their ac|tual contribution to it at its fir&s;t impo&s;ition; on the contrary, that a further addition of &pound;99,400 a year to this proportional payment, mu&s;t be made to bring it to &s;uch equality; and, as they were able to &s;up|port the original charge, and rapidly emerge from a &s;tate of comparative depre&s;&s;ion into that of a decided &s;uperiority over the remainder of the kingdom, that they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the full ability now, to make good their defalcation to the proportional payment.</P>
<P>The burthen of a tax upon all income of the &s;ame condition, as before defined, is the proportion the an|nual charge of the tax bears to the annual amount of the income: thus a double &s;um taken from a double income, and a treble &s;um from a treble in|come, con&s;titute equal burthens; and &s;o on, for any other equimultiples of tax and income.</P>
<P>In 1693, the land-tax, amounting annually to &pound; 1,038,184, was laid on this di&s;trict. In &s;ixteen years of the fir&s;t twenty, the charge was the &s;ame, or at 4<HI>s.</HI> in the pound: for three years at 3<HI>s</HI>; and the
<PB N="83" REF="86">
remaining year at 2<HI>s.</HI> At the Revolution, or five years before its commencement, the remote di&s;trict was in a &s;tate of relative decline; which appears even to have been advancing upon it, with great celerity. Yet the progre&s;s of this decline became retarded; it &s;topped entirely; "the &s;tate of manufactures began to &s;hift;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guthrie's Geography, edit. 1785. p. 367.</NOTE> the lands in the other parts of the kingdom had fallen not very incon&s;iderably; and tho&s;e of the remote di&s;trict advanced to a perfect equality in value with them, &s;o early as the &s;ixteenth year after the expiration of the fir&s;t twenty. It is to be concluded therefore, that during that term of twenty years, the burthen of the land-tax did not exceed the mea&s;ure of that ability, which the di&s;trict then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and that the &s;ame burthen would at pre&s;ent be attended with no oppre&s;&s;ion to them.</P>
<P>Our inquiry therefore mu&s;t be directed to di&s;cover, what charge, in the year 1793, would be equal in burthen to the actual payment of the divi&s;ion, in the year 1693.</P>
<P>The taxability of any income is (every thing el&s;e being alike) as its &s;elling value. From a revenue of &pound;1000 a year in land, or what is called here, income of &s;uperior condition, a larger &s;um may be drawn in taxes, than from the &s;ame rent in buildings, or in|come of inferior condition. Or if an income of the latter kind be reduced in the proportion which its proper number of years purcha&s;e bears to that of an e&s;tate in land, the re&s;ulting amount will be part there|of, which appears to be ju&s;tly the &s;ubject of taxation. Thus having given the national rent of land, and of e&s;tates of inferior condition; the whole may be re|duced into an income, all the equal parts of which &s;hall be of equal value, and equitably pay the &s;ame rate in the pound to a tax. The value of the&s;e rents
<PB N="84" REF="87">
in 1688, and 1774, are &s;everally given. It appears from their amount, that the national rent, during tho&s;e eighty-&s;ix years, increa&s;ed very nearly &frac34; per cent. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 2. &sect; 4.</NOTE> annually: and &s;uppo&s;ing it to have continued to be augmented at this rate, until the year 1793, the taxable national rents of 1693 and 1793 were &pound;12&middot;451 ms.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 2. &sect; 4.</NOTE> and &pound;26&middot;085<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 2. &sect; 4.</NOTE> ms. re&s;pectively</P>
<P>The wealth of the remote, has evidently increa&s;ed with greater celerity, than that of the home di&s;trict; and con&s;equently the advance of the rent thereof ex|ceeded the average rate of the whole kingdom. But let it be admitted to have increa&s;ed at an equal rate only; it follows, that the taxable income of e&s;tates of this divi&s;ion, has increa&s;ed, from the year 1693 to 1793, in the proportion of 26&middot;085 to 12&middot;451; or in that of &pound;0,174,500, to &pound;1,038,184. But this lat|ter &s;um was the amount of the payment of the remote divi&s;ion to the land-tax in 1693: now the experience of that time demon&s;trated, that it was able to bear &s;uch a burthen, for nearly twenty years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and, during that term, to recover in a great mea&s;ure from very depre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances, and make large &s;teps in the road by which it has &s;ince led to a high degree of pro&s;perity: and the former &s;um, &pound;2,174,500, being the payment of equal burthen, the inhabitants of that part of the country are now equally well able to bear it. Their proportional payment was before &s;hown to be &pound;2,075,100, which falls &s;hort of the tax of equal burthen, by &pound;99,400<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 2. &sect; 5.</NOTE> a year. Rea&s;ons of very great validity mu&s;t be pro|duced by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of land in the remote di&s;trict, to oppo&s;e to the claims of their countrymen for re|dre&s;s or equalization: and I will here put the defen|&s;ive argument, in which they &s;eem to repo&s;e the mo&s;t confidence, in as good a light as I am able to place it.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="88"><Q>From the original impo&s;ition of the Land-tax (and a whole century has now elap&s;ed &s;ince that time) all contracts for e&s;tates in this di&s;trict, have been made in full confidence, that this proportion of payment would be perpetual. It is not a few individuals who&s;e intere&s;t are &s;acrificed to this in|novation but the whole body of purcha&s;ers of land, for that whole term; who in number perhaps ex|ceed three fourths of the cotemporary purcha&s;ers in the kingdom. All the&s;e, by one act, will be &s;tripped of a property for which they have paid a fair value, and in which they thought them&s;elves &s;ecured by the public faith. It has certainly been tacitly gi|ven; but it has been ratified as often as the pre&s;ent and original proportion has been re-enacted, which has been an annual practice of the &s;ame continu|ation as the tax. And hence the State is become as firmly pledged, by the&s;e repeated acts, as by the mo&s;t expre&s;s promi&s;e: for a legal right, the mo&s;t ab&s;olute and plenary, both to benefits and exemptions, may be founded on long continued cu&s;toms; and every good &s;y&s;tem of laws, recog|nizes &s;uch cu&s;toms as a foundation of civil right: all inva&s;ions upon them have always been dili|gently repre&s;&s;ed in the common courts, where the maxim, <HI>quieta non &s;unt movenda,</HI> has con&s;tantly been had in reverence. But this cu&s;tom is of a higher nature: it is the cu&s;tom of the legi&s;lature; and the cu&s;tom of parliament is the law of parlia|ment, which is paramount to all its ordinary acts, and a fundamental part of the Con&s;titution; limiting even that power, which limits every thing el&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>To this it is an&s;wered, that the facts alledged are not true: and admitting their truth, the conclu&s;ion mu&s;t then re&s;t entirely upon &s;ome other a&s;&s;umptions, u&s;ed in conjunction with them in the cour&s;e of the
<PB N="86" REF="89">
argument, which are totally repugnant to the fir&s;t principles of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>It is laid down as a fact in this argument, that all purcha&s;ers &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the tax, have been made in full confidence that no equalization would in future take place. To this it is replied, that the expectation of the purcha&s;ers on this head, could not amount to &s;uch a confidence. Our ance&s;|tors in the home di&s;trict, before the impo&s;ition of the tax, made their re&s;pective purcha&s;es, without any compen&s;ation for a perpetual charge upon their pur|cha&s;ed income, of double the magnitude which the new land-owners of the remote counties will have to pay, after the equalization has taken place. I re|peat the words, <HI>of double the magnitude;</HI> for the que&s;tion being here of purcha&s;ed income only, by the equalization they will lo&s;e a part of &s;uch income, equal to one half only of that taken away from our ance&s;tors, at the original impo&s;ition of the tax: and this is the whole purcha&s;ed income, the tax after, equalization will take from them; the part thereof paid by them at pre&s;ent not being purcha&s;ed income. For at the treaty for the &s;ale of the e&s;tate to each in|dividual, its amount was deducted out of its income, and no money paid for it; and their expectation, that the whole of their purcha&s;ed income would be liable to no tax, mu&s;t have been weakened, by their knowledge that the State had formerly taken from the per&s;ons they repre&s;ent, the &s;ame quantity of pur|cha&s;ed income which is now required for the equa|lization; and from the proprietors of the home di|&s;trict, the double of that quantity. Their expectation therefore of continuing to enjoy the whole of their purcha&s;ed income untaxed, mu&s;t be le&s;s than that entertained by our ance&s;tors, prior to their having experienced &s;uch an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment; and even the ex|pectation the latter might form, mu&s;t have fallen very
<PB N="87" REF="90">
&s;hort of the mea&s;ure of full confidence, pretended to by the purcha&s;ers of the home di&s;trict; as, in the cour&s;e of more than fifty years before the land-tax took place, occa&s;ional aids of great amount, under other names, had frequently been levied upon land. The confidence therefore under which they pretend to have purcha&s;ed mu&s;t have been dimini&s;hed, by the experience of the former failure of a confidence, bet|ter founded, in the ca&s;e of the home di&s;trict. It therefore could not be what they &s;tyle it, a full con|fidence. And it may be added (though it depends upon a principle to be proved hereafter) that they mu&s;t always have &s;u&s;pected, that the inequality of the land-tax mu&s;t ultimately be remedied; becau&s;e, in counties where the greater outlines of a moral policy are upon the whole well pre&s;erved, no exemption flagrantly abu&s;ive can &s;ub&s;i&s;t to all perpetuity: and that &s;uch forms of government, by their own internal vigour, ultimately purge off all real feculencies.</P>
<P>But if we examine this full confidence which has perpetually exi&s;ted, a little more clo&s;ely, we &s;hall come to its true nature: it is a new &s;pecies of full confidence, which has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted under a con&s;tant ex|pectation, entertained in both parts of the kingdom, that it would ultimately fail. The &s;ubject of Baron Ma&s;eres's work on annuities, makes him a very good authority on this head; he has be&s;ide paid con&s;ide|rable attention to it: by him we are informed, that <Q>the per&s;ons who have been lightly taxed, have <HI>al|ways</HI> feared; and tho&s;e who have been heavily taxed, have <HI>always</HI> hoped, that the Parliament would, one day or other, have &s;ufficient regard to ju&s;tice to correct this gro&s;s inequality.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ma&s;eres, vol. 2. p. 449.</NOTE> It follows that the purcha&s;ers of e&s;tates in the remote di&s;trict did not, at the time of purcha&s;ing, regard that part of their
<PB N="88" REF="91">
income which an equalization would take from them, as a certain and perpetual annuity; but as a contin|gent income only, which mu&s;t cea&s;e on the happen|ing of a certain event, which was &s;o probable in their opinion, as to be the object of con&s;tant fear. Now nobody can imagine, that the &s;ame number of years purcha&s;e would be paid for an income or part of an income, which it was always feared might be taken from the purcha&s;er, as for an ab&s;olute perpetuity; there mu&s;t have been &s;ome difference in the purcha&s;e-money. Now this difference allowed to the buyer, was the value of the increa&s;e again&s;t the contingency happening; or, the income cea&s;ing by the equali|zation of the tax. And this is effectively the &s;ame thing, as if the purcha&s;er had paid down the whole value of that income; out of which a &s;um equal to the then reputed value of the hazard, had been re|paid to him by the &s;eller, as a proper equivalent to the lo&s;s of it, when it &s;hould happen: all &s;uch purcha&s;ers in the remote di&s;trict, have therefore the con&s;ideration for this addition to the tax in hand; or it has been paid to tho&s;e of whom they are the re|pre&s;entatives; whole virtual engagements, binding the income, they mu&s;t abide by: and it mu&s;t be admitted, that the&s;e purcha&s;ers, either by them&s;elves or their repre&s;entatives, have one with another been permitted to enjoy this contingent annuity, a much longer term than they could have expected; for if no &s;econd &s;ale of the &s;ame e&s;tate had taken place, during the whole century the di&s;parity has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, the pur|cha&s;er and tho&s;e claiming under him, will, according to the equality of chance, have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this beneficial contingency fifty years; and taking repeated &s;ales into the que&s;tion, the term may pro|bably have been about thirty-five, or forty years.</P>
<P>But let it be now &s;uppo&s;ed, that all the&s;e contracts for the purcha&s;e of land, were actually as improvi|dently made as they were &s;tated to be: join to this
<PB N="89" REF="92">
the well-known fact, that Parliament has adhered, du|ring a whole century, to the &s;ame proportion of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ment: yet this will not &s;erve as a foundation, to prove &s;uch a cu&s;tom as is alledged; granting all that is laid down in law books upon the validity of cu&s;tom: for it is <Q>an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim of the law, <HI>malus u&s;us abolen|dus e&s;t;</HI></Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black&s;tone's Com. v. 1. p. 76. 1783.</NOTE> an inequitable cu&s;tom mu&s;t be aboli&s;hed.

<P>As the continuance of the immunity contended for, fails of all &s;upport from its analogy to a legal cu&s;tom; its only remaining defence mu&s;t re&s;t upon the principles of natural equity.</P>
<P>Let us therefore examine, how far it can be re|conciled to the fir&s;t principles on which human &s;ociety is formed, and on which it continues to be kept to|gether. The&s;e are always clearly di&s;coverable, by the fiction of a number of wi&s;e and well-di&s;po&s;ed indivi|duals,
<PB N="90" REF="93">
who were before independent of each other, meeting to form a compact to enter into &s;ociety; and all di&s;gui&s;e of their &s;entiments and circum&s;tances being out of the que&s;tion, by the de&s;cription of the individuals forming &s;uch a meeting, the want of each individual, for the protection of all the re&s;t, and his de&s;ire to obtain it, would be really and ap|parently equal; and every one would readily and hone&s;tly engage to contribute to the protection of all the re&s;t, by pre&s;tations, bearing the &s;ame pro|portion to his ability, or con&s;tituting equal burthens to him;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By pre&s;tations are to be under&s;tood, renders of per&s;onal &s;er|vice, or of commodities, or both jointly; or of their repre&s;enta|tive &s;igns.</NOTE> for there exi&s;ts no ground, in the ca&s;e de|&s;cribed, why le&s;s or more than that proportion &s;hould be either required or accepted of, or engaged for by any one.</P>
<P>That the burthens of every member of the &s;ame community be equal, is therefore the fir&s;t principle on which human &s;ociety is founded; and that com|pact is violated, when any one refu&s;es to take his proportioned &s;hare in the aggregate burthen: it is of moral obligation as long as he enjoys the pro|tection of the &s;ociety or nation; and &s;uch obligation, a &s;eries of infractions of no length, although it may very well &s;uit the iniquity of &s;elf-intere&s;t to call it a cu&s;tom, can invalidate: moral obligations cannot be pre&s;cribed again&s;t. No ab&s;olute and declared act of any legi&s;lature can cancel the fir&s;t article of this primitive convention. Parliament, therefore, is not competent to pledge the national faith, even by an expre&s;s law, that the tax &s;hould not be equalized; and it will not, I &s;uppo&s;e, be pleaded, that that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly could tacitly contract &s;uch an en|gagement on the part of the nation, when an expre&s;s
<PB N="91" REF="94">
declaratory law to that purpo&s;e would, in it&s;elf, be null and void.</P>
<P>Upon the grounds of the objection, advanced by the remote di&s;trict, again&s;t an equalization of the tax, it might be likewi&s;e proved, that &s;uch tax ought never to be laid in countries where it has not been laid before; and where it has, that it &s;hould be immediately repealed: for, prior to the introduction of &s;uch a tax, every purcha&s;er of an e&s;tate would have paid the full market value of its clear income, and of every part thereof; and the tax will take from him an income he has purcha&s;ed under the full &s;ecurity of enjoying it; a &s;ecurity more complete, and much higher in degree, than the land-owners of the remote di&s;trict can entertain. This being an ab&s;olute inju&s;tice, &s;uch a tax ought not to be introduced; and where it is already e&s;tabli&s;hed, the evil ought to be remedied as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; and, with very little trouble, it might be &s;hown upon the &s;ame ground, that every other tax ought to be repealed.</P>
<P>There is a very numerous cla&s;s of proprietors in the remote di&s;trict, who po&s;&s;e&s;s e&s;tates which have been in their families for the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erm of the ex|i&s;tence of the tax; during which, a double charge has fallen upon the income of tho&s;e of the home counties. If the former were to re&s;t the continuance of this inequality upon their own intere&s;t, they would want even a verbal preten&s;ion to re&s;i&s;t the claims made upon them. Inju&s;tice does not like, however, to go quite bare-faced; &s;he will rather make u&s;e of any flim&s;y tatter, almo&s;t tran&s;parent, to veil her|&s;elf with.

<PB N="92" REF="95">
the&s;e unite to give this mi&s;erable &s;hadow of a pre|tence for the continuance of oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice, weight and currency; and together with tho&s;e who&s;e claims to indulgence they avow them&s;elves to defend, they form a great majority of the landlords of the remote counties; that is, of three quarters of Eng|land. Yet if this argument, in its be&s;t form, were propo&s;ed to any &s;en&s;ible man, who was not previou&s;ly acquainted with it, and with the intere&s;ts and pre|judices which combine to &s;upport it, and he was told at the &s;ame time, that it was the language held by a large party of well-informed men in England, he would be apt to &s;u&s;pect the veracity of the relation.</P>
<P>Hitherto the difference of the charge of the land-tax of the home di&s;trict, and that of the whole of the remote divi&s;ion, has been con&s;idered; it remains only to draw a compari&s;on of the former, with a part of the latter, the county of York. The actual and proportional payment of that county to the land-tax, and its rate in the pound, are the only points to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Following the proce&s;s laid down at the beginning of this Section, it appears that the rent of the home di&s;trict is to that of the county of York, as 10,000 to 4034; the actual payment of the home di&s;trct, to the land-tax, is &pound;.652,275; and the proportional payment of the county, &pound;.263,120; its actual pay|ment is &pound;.91,620; and the defalcation, &pound;.171,500.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>This proportional charge is to the actual payment, as 10,000 to 3481; and for every &pound;.10,000 paid by the county to this tax, the proportional charge is &pound;. 28,719: the tax upon the home counties is 2<HI>s.</HI> and 1 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"><HI>d.</HI> and upon the county of York 8<HI>d.</HI> and 9/10<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> in the pound.</P>

Hi&s;tory, p: 82, 3.</NOTE> con&s;i&s;ted of three parts, as fol|lows&mdash;The &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome &s;maller boroughs, which ultimately were to have been about fifty in number: this was to have been done by the pur|cha&s;e of the right of election of &s;ingle boroughs, whenever the con&s;ent of two thirds of the electors was obtained for its &s;urrender.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="97">The fir&s;t &s;et of boroughs to have been disfranchi&s;ed, was in number thirty-&s;ix: and &s;eventy-two members were to be added to the repre&s;entatives for counties, in &s;uch proportion to each, <Q>as the wi&s;dom of Par|liament might pre&s;cribe:</Q> and copyholders were to have been admitted to the right of voting, in all the counties.</P>
<P>After this part of the plan had been fully exe|cuted, the rights of election of other boroughs were to have been bought up, and transferred to large towns at pre&s;ent unrepre&s;ented. As it was &s;uppo&s;ed, that the new members would ultimately amount to about a hundred; the number of the &s;econd cla&s;s of boroughs to have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, would have been nearly fourteen; and in populous towns, where the num|ber of electors are very few, that franchi&s;e was to have been extended to all the inhabitants.</P>
<P>By this plan, the number of members in the Hou&s;e of Commons would have remained unaltered; &s;trict regard being had to the article of the Union on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>That of Mr. Flood <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New Annual Regi&s;ter, 1790. Hi&s;tory, p. 94.</NOTE> con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;ingle article only&mdash;That a hundred new members &s;hould be ad|ded to the Hou&s;e, to be elected by the hou&s;eholders of the counties.</P>
<P>By the fir&s;t, if executed in its full extent, about fifty boroughs would have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: by the &s;econd, they are all &s;uppo&s;ed to continue in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their franchi&s;e. According to the former, &s;ome greater towns, now unrepre&s;ented, were to have the privilege of returning members to Parliament; the number of the&s;e members would have been about twenty-eight: by the latter, no new grant of this kind was made. And la&s;tly, by the &s;cheme of 1785, the members of counties were to have been increa&s;ed
<PB N="95" REF="98">
by &s;eventy-two; and by a hundred, by the plan of 1790: but by both, the right of voting is extended to electors of new de&s;criptions; and the number of members who would have obtained &s;eats upon ab&s;o|lutely new appointments, by the fir&s;t, is the &s;ame as that which would have been added to the Hou&s;e by the &s;econd of the&s;e &s;chemes of alteration.</P>
<P>The &s;everal parts of each of them, and the cir|cum&s;tances connected with them, which tend to af|fect the balance of power in the repre&s;entation of the two di&s;tricts, are now to be made the &s;ubject of di&s;|qui&s;ition.</P>
<P>The continuance or the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the elective franchi&s;es of the boroughs, will produce &s;ome dif|ference in the effects of the alteration of the Lower Hou&s;e, upon this balance. It will therefore be &s;hown that there is no probability that in future &s;uch &s;uppre&s;&s;ion will take place; for it is by no means certain that it would have been affected, if the Bill of 1785 had been pa&s;&s;ed into its original form: but it is more clearly evinced by the following argument. It will be oppo&s;ed by all tho&s;e who wi&s;h to uphold the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the Hou&s;e; and they will be &s;upported in their oppo&s;ition (judging from what is pa&s;t) by the mo&s;t effective advocates for a change.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, it is by no means certain that the elec|tive franchi&s;es of certain boroughs would have been bought up and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, if the Bill of Mr. Pitt in 1785 had pa&s;&s;ed into a law.</P>
<P>For, prior to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of any borough, the Bill made it requi&s;ite that two thirds of the electors &s;hould &s;ignify, in a pre&s;cribed manner, their a&s;&s;ent to re&s;ign their elective franchi&s;es. This act indeed would become binding upon the whole; and they were to receive a compen&s;ation for their &s;urrender, which
<PB N="96" REF="99">
would, upon an average, have amounted to &pound;27,777 to each borough.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One million was to have been allotted, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of 36 boroughs. New Annual Regi&s;ter, 1785. Hi&s;t. p. 82.</NOTE></P>
<P>But we cannot but perceive there was, by this plan, much left to chance in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the bo|roughs It was po&s;tponed to an indefinite period; and Mr. Pitt admitted, that <Q>the operation of the &s;cheme would not have been immediate, at lea&s;t in its fulle&s;t extent.</Q> It was declared however, that the benefit of the plan was expected to be felt, before the expiration of the Parliament then newly a&s;&s;embled. When Mr. Flood propo&s;ed his plan in 1790, he ob&s;erved on this head, <Q>that the purcha&s;e mu&s;t be &s;low and uncertain, and that the wor&s;t boroughs, tho&s;e of Government, would never re&s;ign.</Q></P>
<P>There is a very great party in the Hou&s;e, who &s;upport the boroughs as part of the exi&s;ting Con&s;titu|tion: and when their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion is again moved (judging from what is pa&s;t), we may pronounce, they will be joined by a very effective body of the advo|cates for a change; namely, tho&s;e who &s;hall follow on this &s;ubject the former &s;entiments of Mr. Fox; and (as we are not to pre&s;ume on a change of opinion in any man, till we have &s;ome evidence of it) by that great leader of Oppo&s;ition him&s;elf. The outline of Mr. Flood's plan has been given before he propo&s;ed the admi&s;&s;ion of one hundred new members for counties into the Hou&s;e, to be elected in a manner he de&s;cribed, and to leave the boroughs in their pre&s;ent &s;tate. Mr. Fox owned <Q>that he thought its outlines the be&s;t he had ever heard &s;ugge&s;ted upon the &s;ub|ject.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">New Annual Regi&s;ter, 1790. Hi&s;t. p. 94.</NOTE></P>
<P>But nothing could tend to give more &s;tability and permanence to them, than the effect of &s;ome of the
<PB N="97" REF="100">
principles laid down by him upon this &s;ubject, in 1785. He contended that the franchi&s;e election was a pub|lic tru&s;t, and not a property; which therefore the public had a right to re&s;ume, without any pecuniary con&s;ideration. If it be admitted that the principle contains an ab&s;tract truth, no ab&s;tract propo&s;ition can be laid down, tending to rai&s;e a &s;tronger barrier again&s;t all attempts to get rid of the boroughs. It precludes all treaty between the electors, and all other per&s;ons intere&s;ted in the thirty-&s;ix boroughs, and the State; and by alarming all the re&s;t, it mu&s;t have united them in a much firmer combination in the general defence. He likewi&s;e laid a further difficulty in the way of the mea&s;ure; arguing on the princi|ples of tho&s;e who con&s;ider the right of voting for a repre&s;entative as a property, he did <Q>not he&s;itate to declare, that he would never agree to the purcha|&s;ing from the majority of the electors, the property of the whole.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New Annual Regi&s;ter, 1785. Hi&s;t. p. 85, 86.</NOTE> In requiring a perfect unanimity of the whole body of the electors of a borough, the difficulty of obtaining a voluntary re&s;ignation of their elective powers, was increa&s;ed to the utmo&s;t; and when in the &s;ame debate he honoured with <Q>his par|ticular approbation, that principle which, by a di|minution of members for boroughs, tended to in|crea&s;e the proportion of knights of the &s;hire,</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New Annual Regi&s;ter, 1785. Hi&s;t. p. 85, 86.</NOTE> one is a lo&s;s to conceive, by what practical means he could give it effect; nor, unle&s;s he looked upon it as a po|litical impo&s;&s;ibility, can this decided prai&s;e which he has given to the ab&s;tract principle, be reconciled to his declaring afterward the outlines of a plan from which it was expre&s;sly excluded, the be&s;t he had ever heard &s;ugge&s;ted upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The name of Mr. Flood it&s;elf, independent of this approbation, will influence many in favour of this
<PB N="98" REF="101">
di&s;tingui&s;hing part of his &s;cheme; and a great cla&s;s of the &s;upporters of the change, become &s;upporters of the continuance of the elective franchi&s;e of the bo|roughs.</P>
<P>The qualified &s;y&s;tem, however, which he endea|voured to introduce, bore a nearer re&s;emblance to that of the late Lord Chatham, than he &s;eemed di&s;|po&s;ed to admit. The plan of that nobleman, was to make <Q>an addition to the county repre&s;entatives; leaving the rotten boroughs, as he expre&s;&s;ed it, to drop off by time.</Q>&dagger; Mr. Flood propo&s;ed, that the new repre&s;entatives of counties &s;hould be elected by the re&s;ident hou&s;eholders: the &s;econd article of Lord Chatham's plan, the leaving the boroughs in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, he profe&s;&s;ed to retain; and ob&s;erves up|on Mr. Pitt's &s;cheme, that <Q>to disfranchi&s;e them might be arbitrary; but that to buy them out, would be to build reform, not on purity, but cor|ruption.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New Annual Regi&s;ter, 1790. Hi&s;t. p. 93.</NOTE></P>
<P>From this account of the two debates on the change of the repre&s;entation, it does not &s;eem certain, from what pa&s;&s;ed at the fir&s;t, that the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;maller boroughs would have been carried into execu|tion, if the addition of county members had been con|&s;ented to; and in the &s;econd, this part of the plan was not only de&s;erted, but treated with no very indirect cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>In the further &s;upport of this conclu&s;ion, I &s;hall bring forward the authority of another of the greater patrons of this revolution in the third e&s;tate; who is to be under&s;tood as delivering the &s;entiments of that great body of men, who have taken the lead in this mea&s;ure, and who have placed him at their head. The evidence here to be produced, is that of the Rev. Mr. Wyvill, late chairman of the committee
<PB N="99" REF="102">
of the York&s;hire a&s;&s;ociation. In his Defence of the Reformers of England, pages 15, 62, 80, 82, 90, 95, when he &s;peaks of the boroughs, he is totally &s;ilent as to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of any: every thing that he &s;ays relating to them, is confined to the liberation of the electors from the &s;tate of influence, or even of &s;ub|jection, under which he &s;tates them to be brought by certain individuals: and to the&s;e he likewi&s;e &s;trongly urges, the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;igning their u&s;ur|pations; the abolition of which he repre&s;ents as the ultimate object of popular pur&s;uit. This amounts to an ab&s;olute di&s;avowal of all the plans for their di&s;|franchi&s;ement. It al&s;o might be inferred that &s;uch a thorough mea&s;ure would not meet his concurrence, or that of the party of which he is the head, from the principle he lays down, <Q>that men do not at|tempt to correct, what they wi&s;h to de&s;troy.</Q> He had given great prai&s;e, indeed, to the plan brought forward by Mr. Pitt in 1785: but what he has &s;aid on each &s;ubject, ought to be &s;o con&s;trued, that his declarations on both may be made to &s;tand together. This prai&s;e is general; and &s;uch prai&s;e may always be &s;uppo&s;ed to be attended with the re&s;erve of &s;ome par|ticulars, which a writer does not &s;top to &s;pecify, or intentionally declines it: his approbation is therefore to be under&s;tood, to extend to the other parts of Mr. Pitt's plan, exclu&s;ive of the disfranchi&s;ement of bo|roughs; and &s;o taken, the appearance of contradiction &s;tated here is done away.</P>
<P>It re&s;ults from the whole of this, that no &s;erious at|tempt will be probably made, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of any of the &s;maller boroughs: it is rather to be ex|pected, that, at a future period, a compromi&s;e may be offered between the &s;pirit of alteration and borough influence, perhaps by laying them a little more open; that &s;omething may be gained to the former, and &s;ome|thing pre&s;erved to the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="103">The mea&s;ures to be pur&s;ued with re&s;pect to the boroughs, are not without their con&s;equence, in de|termining what &s;hare of power each of the di&s;tricts will have in the Hou&s;e of Commons, after a change of its con&s;titution &s;hall have been affected; as will be &s;hown in its proper place. What they will probably in future be, has been therefore here examined upon the authorities of leaders of parties. It will be like|wi&s;e &s;hown further on, that the plan of laying open the boroughs, as far as it has any effect on this fu|ture balance of power, will operate again&s;t the home di&s;trict.</P>
<P>It follows likewi&s;e from what has been already ad|vanced, that the home di&s;trict ought &s;o to act, when|ever this mea&s;ure &s;hall be attempted a third time, as if no more was intended to be carried, than what was moved for the &s;econd; namely, an addition to the number of county members only.</P>
<P>A &s;econd great alteration in the con&s;titution of the Hou&s;e, by the plan of 1785, was giving the fran|chi&s;e of election to &s;ome populous towns at pre&s;ent not repre&s;ented: it was calculated that the number of members &s;o to be admitted, would amount to about twenty-eight. Now the remote di&s;trict having in|crea&s;ed in manufactures and population, with much greater celerity than the home counties; the number of towns in the former, ri&s;en into the required degree of con&s;equence, bear a greater proportion to its mag|nitude, than tho&s;e of the latter; and in&s;tances per|haps are there only to be &s;ound, of market towns ri&s;ing into the magnitude of great cities, and villages into that of populous towns. Hence the number of new members to be thus added to the remote di&s;trict, &s;hall exceed that of the home di&s;trict, more than in the proportion of its magnitude, or that of 314 to 100, the ratio of their landed capital. The neare&s;t ap|proach to this proportion, in integer numbers, is by
<PB N="101" REF="104">
allotting &s;even members to the &s;maller di&s;trict, and twenty-one to the larger; which thus would acquire a majority of fourteen. But the number of votes thus acquired by the remote di&s;trict, is le&s;s than the pro|portion a&s;&s;igned above points out; and it has been &s;hown that it ought to be greater: and more proba|bly, the lea&s;t acqui&s;ition of the latter might be taken at twenty-three, and of the former at five; or the re|mote di&s;trict acquire a new addition to its majority in the Hou&s;e, on all territorial que&s;tions, of eighteen voices.</P>
<P>The la&s;t alteration the&s;e plans hold out, is that of ad|ding to the number of the county members; and in this they both concur. By the plan of Mr. Pitt this addi|tion was to have been of &s;eventy-two; which were to have been allotted in &s;uch proportion to each coun|ty, "as the wi&s;dom of Parliament might pre&s;cribe."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New Annual Regi&s;ter, 1785. Hi&s;t. p. 82.</NOTE> It may be here taken, that the addition to be made to the number of members returned by each county, would be &s;uch, as to make its &s;hare in the repre&s;en|tation proportioned as nearly as po&s;&s;ible to its weight and importance in the &s;cale of the general landed in|tere&s;t; that is, to the total value of &s;uch county it|&s;elf. And the pre&s;ent number of county members being ninety-two, and that of the propo&s;ed addition &s;eventy-two; the repre&s;entatives of the landed intere&s;t would thus amount to one hundred and &s;ixty-four.</P>
<P>Now the value of the home and remote di&s;trict be|ing to each other as 10,000 and 31,814 re&s;pectively; the balance of power of tho&s;e divi&s;ions in the Lower Hou&s;e, according to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, and the pro|po&s;ed plan of alteration here con&s;idered, is &s;hown in the following comparative &s;tatement.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 5. &sect; 1.</NOTE></P>

<P>By this plan the majority of the repre&s;entatives of the landed intere&s;t of the home divi&s;ion, would be increa&s;ed from forty-four to eighty-&s;ix, or very nearly doubled.</P>
<P>But this majority would have received a further acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength, by a di&s;proportionate addition of new members for great towns, if that part of the plan of 1785 had ever been carried into execution. For the majority of the members of the whole di|&s;trict would have received a further increa&s;e of four|teen votes, or have now become fifty-&s;ix in the whole: for the latter would have brought an augmentation of power to the landed intere&s;t of its proper di&s;trict; though perhaps not quite &s;o certain and effective, as an equal addition of repre&s;entatives of counties.</P>
<P>We &s;hall find that the con&s;equences of Mr. Flood's plan would have been in this re&s;pect very nearly the &s;ame: and at the fir&s;t view, there is the appearance of total coincidence between both. He propo&s;ed that the number of repre&s;entatives &s;hould be increa&s;ed one hundred, and that they &s;hould be elected by the hou&s;eholders of the counties. The&s;e are inhabitants of market towns and villages, the latter are chiefly landlords and tenants, with a few little trade&s;men; the former contain a greater number of trade&s;men and artificers in tolerable circum&s;tances; but who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s chiefly depends upon the neighbouring far|mers
<PB N="103" REF="106">
or gentry. Here we &s;ee nothing but landed proprietors and electors of the two other de&s;criptions, either immediately or mediately dependent upon them. The new cla&s;s of members, in both the great di&s;tricts of the kingdom, will be returned by the landed in|tere&s;t; and be in all re&s;pects as much repre&s;entatives of that intere&s;t, as if the votes by which they are ap|pointed had been given by men of landed property only. Hence, if this &s;cheme be carried into execu|tion, the number of repre&s;entatives of the landed in|tere&s;t being increa&s;ed by one hundred, will become one hundred and ninety-two: and the number of members of both the great divi&s;ions of the king|dom, by the new arrangement, are to be taken as being made proportional to the value of e&s;tates in each; according to the &s;uppo&s;ition laid down, when the corre&s;ponding part of the &s;cheme of 1785 was under con&s;ideration: and the comparative &s;tatement of the new and old repre&s;entations of the two di&s;tricts, may be exhibited as follows.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 5. &sect; 2.</NOTE></P>

<P>By this plan the majority of the repre&s;entatives of the landed intere&s;t of the remote di&s;trict, would be con&s;iderably more than doubled.</P>
<P>This decrea&s;e of power of the landed intere&s;t of the home di&s;trict in the Commons, is an unbalanced lo&s;s, to be repaired by no probable circum&s;tance. If the power of &s;ending members to parliament, had been taken from, or re&s;igned by a number of the &s;maller
<PB N="104" REF="107">
boroughs; part of tho&s;e which would have been &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, would undoubtedly have been &s;ituated in the remote di&s;trict; and thus this decrea&s;e of power would have been in &s;ome degree, though inadequately, counterbalanced. But that idea, which never ap|pears to have been cordially taken up by the greater patrons of the change, was &s;oon avowedly de&s;erted, and even condemed. And if it be now to be purpo&s;ed, that any alteration &s;hould take place in them, it will only be in the number and de&s;cription of their elec|tors. But whether mea&s;ures for this purpo&s;e are to be embraced, or not, the con&s;equences to re&s;ult from the increa&s;e of the majority of the county members of the remote di&s;trict, will remain the &s;ame as if no change were made in &s;uch bodies or borough elec|tion; for there is nothing in &s;uch alteration to coun|terbalance this increa&s;ed majority: if it have any feeble effect in this ca&s;e, it will act in concurrence with it.</P>
<P>On account of the con&s;equences which the conti|nuance of the &s;maller boroughs will be attended with, the probability of it has been con&s;idered at &s;ome length. I therefore add this further ob&s;ervation only upon the &s;ubject: tho&s;e who are, from principle alone, friends to this alteration of the Con&s;titution, will con&s;ent to their continuance under &s;ome modi|fications, to dimini&s;h the oppo&s;ition they mu&s;t other|wi&s;e meet, and tho&s;e of the remote di&s;trict, who are patrons of it from local intere&s;ts alone, or jointly with other motives, will concur with the former. And this is additional evidence, that a total disfranchi&s;e|ment of the &s;maller boroughs will not be attempted. But let it be now admitted that it actually takes place; and let its con&s;equence, in conjunction with an in|crea&s;e of the members for counties, upon the propor|tion of power to the landed intere&s;t of the home di|&s;trict, in the Lower Hou&s;e, be now examined.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="108">It has been before ob&s;erved, that it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;ome or many of the boroughs to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed are &s;ituated in the remote di&s;trict: thus &s;ome counter|balance to the increa&s;e of its majority will take place; although it cannot be doubted, that if a number of boroughs were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in that di&s;trict, and their members added to the counties, its landed intere&s;t in the Hou&s;e would be very much &s;trengthened; and its influence, in every thing relating to charges upon land, very much increa&s;ed. For the landed e&s;tates of county members, upon an average, very con&s;iderably exceed tho&s;e of the repre&s;entatives of boroughs: they are there|fore far more intere&s;ted in all charges upon their own land; and they will not only join with more unani|mity in oppo&s;ing them, but they will individually exert their per&s;onal abilities with more energy, and em|ploy their more exten&s;ive intere&s;t with a more earne&s;t diligence, to the &s;ame end. But let it be admitted that any number of them could be found, di&s;po&s;ed to &s;acrifice their immediate pecuniary intere&s;t to public ju&s;tice or expediency; they have another ob|ject, at lea&s;t of equal magnitude, to &s;urmount: the private intere&s;t of all their con&s;tituents is directly again&s;t the increa&s;e of charge upon land, with whom, taken in the aggregate, it is always public virtue, not to give up a partial or total exemption from any ge|neral chage; to re&s;i&s;t the impo&s;ition of a new, or the exten&s;ion of an old tax. It is a kind of local patrio|ti&s;m: and the honours of this patrioti&s;m are ac|quired in villages, by cheating the hundred for the good of the pari&s;h; in the hundred, by cheating the province; in the province, by defrauding the nation; and in a nation, by robbing the world in general. And if any individual belonging to one of the&s;e &s;ocieties, endeavour to counteract the&s;e objects of public uti|tity, he is looked upon as a betrayer of the public intere&s;t, and a traitor. Hence, if a county member of the remote di&s;trict were to give his vote for the equali|zation

of the land-tax, he might not only lo&s;e his &s;eat, but retire under no &s;mall load of popular odium. Many individuals may be found, who have that re|gard for the general State, that they will &s;ubmit to burthens, which they have the mo&s;t probable expec|tations of being able to evade: a &s;entiment which hardly ever di&s;covers it&s;elf in great bodies of men. Among the rea&s;ons to be given for this, is, that here the blame of inju&s;tice re&s;ts upon the whole, and no part of it &s;eparately attaches it&s;elf to any one in par|ticular.</P>
<P>And as charges on land are le&s;s expen&s;ive in general upon the repre&s;entatives of boroughs, their property in land, upon an average, not being nearly &s;o large as that of members for counties; &s;o their con&s;tituents of the foRmer are le&s;s intere&s;ted in &s;uch charges than tho&s;e of the latter. It will even frequently happen, that they are totally unintere&s;ted in the tax of the lands in their neighbourhood: or as, by the impo&s;i|tion of &s;uch taxes, they may expect to avoid future additions to their own, their intere&s;t may be con|trary to that of the di&s;trict in which the borough is &s;ituated. The members of many boroughs are there|fore quite uninfluenced by the landed intere&s;t of the circumjacent country, as far as re&s;pects the &s;ecurity of their &s;eats: and even where a member is effec|tively nominated by a &s;ingle opulent landed man, it is much more probable that he will leave him to act by his own di&s;cretion, on this head, than that he will &s;o be left, in this ca&s;e, by the landlords of a whole county; for individuals are much more frequently determined by di&s;intere&s;ted motives, than numerous bodies of men.</P>
<P>It follows from this, that if a number of boroughs disfranchi&s;ed, and their members added to the landed intere&s;t, increa&s;ing the number &s;ent by both di&s;tricts, &s;o as to render them proportional to their values, the
<PB N="107" REF="110">
&s;uperiority of the remote di&s;trict in the Hou&s;e will be very con&s;iderably increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>And if the privilege of voting for the members of the &s;maller boroughs be extended to the land-owners of the circumjacent counties, the repre&s;entatives of every &s;uch borough, will be more influenced by the landed intere&s;t than before: and if all &s;uch boroughs be &s;o laid open, the remote di&s;trict will acquire &s;ome further degree of &s;uperiority in the Legi&s;lature; which may not be incon&s;iderable, and without danger to the home counties.</P>
<P>What has been already &s;aid leads to a que&s;tion, the examination of which cannot properly be here de|clined; that is, how far the con&s;equences re&s;ulting from this alteration, have or have not been among the motives for the &s;ingular zeal and per&s;everance with which this object has been pur&s;ued, of late years, in certain parts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it may here be ob&s;erved, that it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible that it could at any time have been the general motive of any great combination of men, in any part of the kingdom; for in that ca&s;e the expected effect of the mea&s;ure mu&s;t have been as exten&s;ively known, as the motive was general: and its very publicity would have rendered its &s;ucce&s;s im|po&s;&s;ible, by alarming the home di&s;trict again&s;t it, who&s;e concurrence in it its advocates might not only wi&s;h, but otherwi&s;e expect to obtain. Be&s;ide, the ar|guments by which it would be defended, whatever &s;uperficial appearance of plau&s;ibility they might be dre&s;&s;ed out with, would appear to be nothing but the mockery of inju&s;tice. It cannot therefore have po&s;&s;i|bly been the motive of the great exertions of com|munities at large.</P>
<P>Again, the con&s;equence pointed out cannot have been the motive of numerous committees in any part of England, to have taken up &s;uch a mea&s;ure; for
<PB N="108" REF="111">
if it had been &s;o, it would have become matter of general notoriety: nor is it to me credible, there can be indi&s;criminately taken in any part of England, out of any political party, a numerous a&s;&s;embly of men of property and education, as many of the com|mittees for this purpo&s;e have been, to whom any man, or &s;et of men, would venture to propo&s;e the pur&s;uit of &s;uch an end as has been de&s;cribed, by &s;uch means.</P>
<P>Yet it appears extremely probable, that the effect of this alteration to perpetuate the inequality of the land-tax, did not e&s;cape the attention of all per&s;ons who were intere&s;ted in it: however, it might pa&s;s to|tally unheeded, by a great body of tho&s;e who actively concurred with them, and even of their o&s;ten&s;ible leaders; and of the&s;e per&s;ons &s;ome might have con|tributed to give movement to this bu&s;ine&s;s, and to &s;upport that unwearied &s;pirit with which it has been per&s;evered in. And the general cicum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, the county where, and the peculiar time when, the mea&s;ures to carry this plan into execution were fir&s;t &s;et on foot, are, taken together, no incon&s;ide|rable evidence of this; at lea&s;t it renders the contrary very difficult to conceive. Such was the per&s;ua&s;ion at lea&s;t which impre&s;&s;ed it&s;elf upon me, if a writer may &s;tate his individual conviction, about the time of the intermi&s;&s;ion of the long per&s;evering &s;truggle of the party formed to effect this change in the con|&s;titution of Parliament, after the check it received by the defeat of 1785.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t county which took up the alteration of the Commons with zeal and &s;y&s;tem, was that of York; and indeed it is the only one which can be &s;aid to have done &s;o. This mea&s;ure was entered upon, at a general meeting of the freeholders, in the year 1779. How far the county was intere&s;ted in this as a defen|&s;ive mea&s;ure, is evident by a compari&s;on of its actual and proportional charges to the land-tax. When
<PB N="109" REF="112">
the nominal rate of that tax is 4<HI>s.</HI> in the pound, its ac|tual charge on the home di&s;trict is 2<HI>s.</HI> and 1&frac23;<HI>d</HI>;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 3.</NOTE> and on the county of York to 8 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"><HI>d.</HI> its actual pay|ment to the tax, at the &s;ame nominal rate, is &pound;.91,620: but its charge on every tract of the home counties, equal in rent, amounts on an average to &pound;.263,120.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sec. 4. table.</NOTE> It is evident therefore, upon an equalization of the land-tax, the charge upon the county of York would be very greatly increa&s;ed; and that it is much more deeply intere&s;ted again&s;t a parliamentary reform of this abu&s;e, than any other county in England.</P>
<P>Therefore the probability here contended for, re|ceives all the &s;upport which can po&s;&s;ibly be derived from the con&s;ideration of the place where the mea&s;ure originated. The evidence deducible from the time and circum&s;tance of its being &s;o taken up, and of the great effort made &s;ome years after to carry it into exe|cution, is now to be brought forward.</P>
<P>It has been &s;hown before, that apprehen&s;ions had always been entertained in the favoured counties, that an equalization of the tax was an event which would one day take place; and the&s;e apprehen&s;ions were greatly increa&s;ed in 1779, the time when the a&s;&s;oci|ation of the county of York was &s;et on foot. Now, in a former Section of this tract, many circum&s;tances have been produced, to prove that a con&s;iderable ad|dition mu&s;t be made to the land-tax, at a near pe|riod: they were mo&s;tly written, when the conclu&s;ion of a very pro&s;perous peace was not e&s;teemed to be &s;o near, as in fact it was found to be: the nece&s;&s;ity of that augmentation could not appear le&s;s in degree, or more remote in di&s;tance, during the de&s;pondency and mi&s;|fortunes of the war of the colonies, when enemy was &s;uperadded to enemy, and when the county of York formed its a&s;&s;ociation. And every &s;uch appearance
<PB N="110" REF="113">
of nece&s;&s;ity to increa&s;e the tax, mu&s;t increa&s;e the ap|prehen&s;ion entertained by the favoured counties, and by that of York in particular: their comparative exemption is approaching with &s;peed to its end.</P>
<P>But there were other cau&s;es then exi&s;ting, peculiar to that juncture, to alarm the fore&s;ight of &s;elf-intere&s;t, and put it upon its guard. Circum&s;tances &s;ufficient to make an impre&s;&s;ion upon every mind, had recently and &s;trongly tended to draw the inequality of the tax to public attention. It has been &s;een before, that the re&s;i&s;t|ance of the colonies to the claims of taxation, was defended by Dr. Franklin (who might then have been properly called their mini&s;ter in England) by the inju&s;tice of the Engli&s;h Parliament, &s;hown by this inequality; that this inju&s;tice he frequently inveighed again&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ma&s;eres on Life-Annuities, p. 450. <Q>This truly great man u&s;ed always to quote the continuance of the land-tax, upon its pre&s;ent very unequal footing, as a proof of the little regard that was had to ju&s;tice and common &s;en&s;e in our national deli|berations.</Q> When it was objected to him, that the correction of this inequality would be unju&s;t to tho&s;e who had purcha&s;ed land, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition of its continuance, he replied with &s;ome quickne&s;s: <Q>Unju&s;t! yes, it would be unju&s;t; for it would be do|ing but half of what &s;trict ju&s;tice requires; which would be, to create a counter-inequality in the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of the land-tax, whereby the lands which had been heavily taxed, &s;hould here|after be taxed lightly; and tho&s;e which had been lightly taxed, &s;hould hereafter be taxed heavily, for the &s;pace of about four|&s;core years; or for a time, which &s;hould be equal to the time during which the pre&s;ent inequality has been permitted to con|tinue.</Q></NOTE> Truths derive effective weight, and receive general currency, from the greatne&s;s of the occa&s;ion on which they are laid down, and the great con&s;equences they are &s;een to draw after them; and whatever gives a &s;ub&s;equent addition to the celebrity of the man who employs them with &s;uch effect, tends more &s;trongly at the in&s;tant to concentrate the general at|tentention to them, and to excite alarm in tho&s;e who&s;e

intere&s;ts they oppo&s;e. And in the begining of 1778, it was known that he had completed the di&s;mem|berment of the empire, by his treaty with France; and in the next, the a&s;&s;ociation of this county was formed. From the political &s;entiments of the majority of its members, he had many admirers, and probably per|&s;onal friends, among them: and no doubt can be entertained, that his &s;entiments on this &s;ubject were &s;ufficiently under&s;tood to &s;everal. As therefore it was a period in which there was greater rea&s;on to expect a formidable attempt, on their relative immunity from the tax, than at any other preceding it; the &s;tronge&s;t probability indicates that there mu&s;t have been &s;ome per&s;ons who urged on the a&s;&s;ociation, as an adequate defen&s;ive mea&s;ure again&s;t it.</P>
<P>If the circum&s;tances which took place when this country made its great effort in 1785, be examined; the &s;ame conclu&s;ion re&s;ults from them. Dr. Price, writing in the beginning of 1784, informs us that in 1783 there had exi&s;ted an exce&s;s of annual expences of the nation above the receipt, of &pound;.1,393,204: part of this he &s;tates to have been temporary; and he e&s;ti|mates the reduced deficit at &pound;.823,642.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Po&s;t&s;cript to State of Public Debt; dated March 22, 1784.

pounds, to be applied to its reduction;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On Life-Annuities, p. 448. He dates the pa&s;&s;age here extracted, April, 1782.</NOTE> that is, in ca&s;e, upon the return of peace, we &s;hall have a defi|ciency of revenue, nearly of the &s;ame amount which was actually found to exi&s;t. The State was then in the very &s;ituation he de&s;cribed; in &s;peaking of which he had added, that it was highly fit to correct the in|equality of the land-tax.</P>
<P>If the revenue had not recovered from this &s;tate of deficiency, recour&s;e mu&s;t have been had to &s;ome very effective tax, or &s;et of taxes; and there was &s;ufficient probability, that it mu&s;t have been to the land-tax, to alarm tho&s;e who were intere&s;ted in it.</P>
<P>This alarm mu&s;t have been greatly increa&s;ed, by the &s;ingular decline of public credit, in the following year 1784; for the price of &s;tock in that year, &s;o far from holding out any expectation of an amend|ment in our &s;ituation, &s;eemed to indicate, that addi|tional calamities were coming upon us with rapidity, and that nothing le&s;s than the mo&s;t ready and effec|tual aids could &s;upport us. That year was marked, by the average price of the 3 per cents &s;tocks having fallen to the lowe&s;t point of depre&s;&s;ion, which had ever been known in the whole period of their exi&s;t|ence: they had &s;unk nearly &pound;.9&frac34; per cent. below the average of the preceding unfortunate war; their mean neat value, in that year, having been &pound;.56.09<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 11. &sect; 4 and 5.</NOTE> per cent. only, even below the lowe&s;t year of that term: and in March 1785, their price in the market had been reduced to &pound;.54&frac78;<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">New Annual Regi&s;ter, Pub. Papers, p. 240.</NOTE> per cent.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ituation of our finances, and the ap|parent nece&s;&s;ity of obtaining a great augmentation of revenue from &s;ome quarter by a very productive tax, in the year 1784, and the begining of 1785; when
<PB N="113" REF="116">
the York&s;hire a&s;&s;ociation exerted all its efforts, to bring about what is called a reform. Now this mea|&s;ure being adapted to the purpo&s;e of continuing their comparative exemption from the land-tax, like a means to an end; being pu&s;hed with great energy, by the county mo&s;t intere&s;ted in flinging ob&s;truc|tions in the way of real reform, that of &s;ub&s;tantial inju&s;tice; and their &s;tronge&s;t exertions having been twice made, at a cri&s;is when the mo&s;t alarming dan|ger threatened that exemption; the&s;e circum&s;tances combined render it credible, that there are per&s;ons, not ignorant of the con&s;equences of an alteration of the con&s;titution of the Hou&s;e of Commons here de|&s;cribed, mixed with the general body of the friends of that plan in the remote di&s;trict, and who are not without influence in the direction of their mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>And there is nothing di&s;coverable which dimi|ni&s;hes the degree of this probability, in the general inaction of this party in the remote di&s;trict, during the &s;ix years of great pro&s;perity, following the rejec|tion of the Bill of 1785, which &s;eemed to have re|moved the danger to an indefinite di&s;tance; nor in the re&s;umption of their operations, with &s;ome little change of mode, during the &s;pring of la&s;t year, when a war upon the Continent was become certain, in which there were grounds to conjecture, that we might be &s;ooner or later involved; whereby their former dan|ger might return upon them, and perhaps increa&s;ed in degree.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now addre&s;s a few ob&s;ervations to both the di&s;tricts, drawn from what has preceded. To the inhabitants of the home counties in general, it may be &s;aid, that, as Nature has given you di&s;advantages to &s;truggle with, your attention ought to be vigilantly employed, that no addition be made to them that can be prevented: Nature, in giving coal-mines to your countrymen, has rendered you tributary to them. This unfortunate di&s;parity in phy&s;ical circum&s;tances,
<PB N="114" REF="117">
has dimini&s;hed many of your manufactures, and per|haps annihilated &s;ome: and on account of the expence of fuel, you are le&s;s able to &s;upport the competition of foreigners, in tho&s;e articles of export trade which remain to you. The &s;uperiority you once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over the re&s;t of the kingdom in foreign commerce, has been lo&s;t above a century: the&s;e misfortunes are derived from natural circum&s;tances; they will proba|bly be as permanent as their cau&s;e, and the inhabi|tants of the home counties mu&s;t acquie&s;ce under them.</P>
<P>The &s;ame however cannot be &s;aid of that which is now to be &s;tated: the &s;hipping in your ports has been &s;o decrea&s;ed, that it requires half the augmen|tation of that of the re&s;t of the kingdom, to make up the lo&s;s; and this &s;hows, not only a relative, but an ab&s;olute decline: and it does not &s;eem, that any natural cau&s;e can be produced for it. It is a lo&s;s of which perhaps no &s;econd in&s;tance can be found to have taken place on the &s;ame extent of coa&s;t, in any part of Europe. In natural advantages, in &s;kits, in capital, the maritime parts of this di&s;trict are &s;uperior to many, if not to mo&s;t of the&s;e equal tracts. This indicates the exi&s;tence of &s;ome artificial cau&s;e, by which this depre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t have been greatly increa&s;ed, if not ab&s;olutely genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed: and the only apparent cau&s;e of it, is the inequality of the land-tax, which not only di&s;tre&s;&s;es the&s;e counties by its direct opera|tion, but, by a circuitous effect, transfers annually a great balance in &s;pecie into the more flouri&s;hing di|vi&s;ion of the kingdom, in addition to the large yearly &s;um, nece&s;&s;arily remitted thither for firing. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the repre&s;entation, the latter cau&s;e of the depre&s;&s;ion of the home counties, does not &s;eem ab&s;olutely out of the reach of remedy: I appeal to the apprehen&s;ions always entertained by the remote di&s;trict, on the &s;ubject of an equalization of the tax, as a proof of it. But their uniform determination to
<PB N="115" REF="118">
employ all their force to oppo&s;e it, has been evident, from the days of Davenant, to the pre&s;ent time. By an alteration of the con&s;titution of the third e&s;tate, their majority of repre&s;entatives of the landed intere&s;t will be doubled: and if at this time, under any pre|tence, they be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by you in mea&s;ures which will effect it, you add to the will to oppre&s;s you, in order to exonerate them&s;elves, a power to do it, which you will never be able to re&s;i&s;t; and deprive your&s;elves of every future hope of palliating your natural di&s;ad|vantages, which, though you may be unable to con|quer, your vigilance, if duly exerted, may dimini&s;h.</P>
<P>With tho&s;e among our&s;elves who call this alteration a reform, I would argue thus:&mdash;An equality of repre|&s;entation, or a nearer approach to it, if de&s;irable, is certainly de&s;irable for &s;ome end. It is to be con|&s;idered as a means, and not as a final object, which is de&s;ireable of it&s;elf, without looking any further. If it be not an end or final object, what is the end or object meant to be obtained by it? You will an&s;wer, that the public charges may be rendered the lea&s;t po&s;|&s;ible; that they be impo&s;ed, with perfect equality, up|on every one of equal ability, and proportionally up|on per&s;ons of different abilities. But it is evident the change for which you are &s;uch &s;trenuous advocates, will give new powers which may be employed to &s;ub|vert the&s;e very ends: the&s;e new powers will be by you entru&s;ted to men, whom experience &s;hows to have been always leagued together, to prevent your ends being carried into effect; and when you have dou|bled their power to defeat them, by your patriotic ex|ertions, you certainly will have made no alteration in their &s;entiments, except that which an increa&s;e of &s;trength always in&s;pires. The &s;elf deceits of intere&s;t gild over many a piece of ba&s;e metal, until it pa&s;&s;es for fine gold from the crucible, even in the opinion of the operator him&s;elf.

<P>By the&s;e plans, &s;ome members are indeed added to the home counties: but with your own hands, you put a weight &s;o much greater into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale, that you effectively annihilate the power of the for|mer.

You wi&s;h, in addition, to disfranchi&s;e the maller boroughs; here other reformers will conter|act you, and your magnificent de&s;ign remain incom|plete.

<P>Be&s;ide, it is to be ob&s;erved, that there is a repug|nancy between the ultimate effect of this majority, and the principle upon which it is declared to be &s;ought; which is, that repre&s;entation, and contri|bution, and the ability to contribute, &s;hould be pro|portional: now that effect will be, to render the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment by which the home di&s;trict is double-taxed, permanent; and to double the majority of repre&s;en|tatives, which that part of the landed intere&s;t now has, which evades half its payments to the public charge.

<P>It has been repeatedly ob&s;erved, that if the prin|ciple of the old a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment be continued, the charge of the home di&s;trict above its proportion mu&s;t in|crea&s;e with every increa&s;e of the tax; and that the effect of the new &s;y&s;tem will be to render this increa|&s;ing oppre&s;&s;ion inevitable. The great majority of its patrons in the remote counties, I make no doubt, will join with every one, who reveres the &s;pirit of our own Con&s;titution, in condeming much of the ge|neral &s;y&s;tem of the old government of France, and much of the detail of its admini&s;tration. Yet &s;uch abu&s;es as the&s;e, that &s;y&s;tem was adequate to the cor|rection of, and effected it. They did not call it re|form, even under that government, bad as it was, to invent a new mode of fortification to cover old op|pre&s;&s;ions, and to be able to extend them. In France as well as in England, parts of the provinces were aggrieved, by being a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed above their proportion to the land-tax.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not the ab&s;olute amounts of the tax in the two king|doms which are here compared, but their proportionality to the values of lands taxed only.</NOTE> Mr. Neckar has given us the mode, in which a remedy was applied to the&s;e inequalities. I think it was put in practice in Upper Guyenne: a valuation was made of the lands, a number of di&s;|tricts, which were generally admitted to be taxed at the average rate: and as the fir&s;t &s;tep to an equali|zation,
<PB N="120" REF="123">
it was permitted to any di&s;trict, the inhabi|tants of which &s;uppo&s;ed their lands to be taxed one third more than that rate, to have them &s;urveyed at their own expence; and if the mea&s;ure of the exce&s;s was found to be of that magnitude, the whole of it was remitted, and the deficiency of the tax made up, by a &s;mall additional levy upon the pro|vince. The greater inequalities being thus remedied, the &s;ame redre&s;s was <HI>extended,</HI> as a &s;econd &s;tep in the operation, to all tho&s;e divi&s;ions who&s;e charge exceed|ed their due proportion by one fourth: and la&s;tly, all tho&s;e places were relieved in the &s;ame mode, who thought the amount of the abatement they would be entitled to, equal to the expence of a &s;urvey and valua|tion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neckar, Engli&s;h tran&s;lation, v. 2. p. 249, from an abridged account.</NOTE> A compari&s;on of the mea&s;ure of the&s;e inequalities with that of the Engli&s;h land-tax, will not be an impro|per addition to this account. Now the average exce&s;s of the charge of the home di&s;trict in England, is much greater than the limit of the highe&s;t cla&s;s of unequal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments in this province: for the average real rate of the tax in this kingdom, is here the proper &s;tand|ard of compari&s;on, and corre&s;ponds to the fixed charge found in France by the fir&s;t valuation which was made the &s;tandard of compari&s;on there. Now that average in England is (one &s;hilling and three pence three farthings) 15.892 pence in the pound<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Section 4. ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le.</NOTE>; and one third of this rate, is (5&frac14;<HI>d.</HI>) 5.297 pence, corre|&s;ponding to the &s;maller limit of the di&s;parity of charge of the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ed cla&s;s of the landlords in this part of France. But the mea&s;ure of that di&s;parity in the home di&s;trict of England, is (9&frac34;<HI>d.</HI>) 9.752 pence in the pound: therefore the mean exce&s;s of charge of that di&s;trict, is to the lower limit of the mo&s;t op|pre&s;&s;ed di&s;trict, in this part of France, as 9.752 to 5.297, or as 18,410 to 10,000; or &s;omething more
<PB N="121" REF="124">
than nine to five. In this tran&s;action the French adopted the idea of a graduated &s;cale, on which they marked the different mea&s;ures of oppre&s;&s;ion, ari&s;ing from the inequality of the land-tax, with the purpo&s;e of apply|ing a remedy to each &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, according to its degree. And, in its con&s;truction, it re&s;embled in principle that of a thermometer; for the fixed point, or that of ab&s;olute equality of contribution, was the zero from which the comparative degrees of oppre&s;|&s;ion or inju&s;tice began to be e&s;timated. We have &s;een that, in the home di&s;trict of England, its mean degree would fall nearly twice as high, as the lower limit of extreme di&s;parity in France; and, if the de|grees of oppre&s;&s;ion in England were marked on a &s;cale by &s;imilar graduation, as one half mu&s;t fall be|low that mean point, &s;o, by the very nature of an average, the other half in number and amount mu&s;t fall above it. The evils of the old French Con&s;ti|tution, and even this evil, while it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, cer|tainly de&s;erved condemnation: but it becomes not the mouth of tho&s;e who per&s;i&s;t in mea&s;ures who&s;e effects promote the continuance, and perhaps the exten&s;ion of greater. Its appearance, it is true, was dark; but when placed upon a ground &s;o much darker, its co|lour &s;eems to a&s;&s;ume a different character.</P>
<P>I do not find in the account I follow, that any op|po&s;ition was made by the favoured di&s;tricts, again&s;t carrying this fair mea&s;ure into execution; although the &s;ufferers could not add to the principles of uni|ver&s;al equity, on which they applied for relief, a &s;e|cond claim to ju&s;tice, and the prompte&s;t ju&s;tice that could be rendered them, drawn from the particular circum&s;tances affecting both parties. They could not, as the proprietors of lands in the home counties, pro|duce hi&s;torical proofs, that the inequality of the tax had been a nece&s;&s;ary relief to their countrymen, at the formation of the original a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, who then la|boured
<PB N="122" REF="125">
under great difficulties and di&s;tre&s;s (a &s;ect which has been &s;hown in the hi&s;tory of the Engli&s;h tax); and then appeal to the united principles, of gratitude, ju&s;tice, and of honour, to be freed from a burthen their humanity had been in&s;trumental in im|po&s;ing upon them, now the rea&s;on had &s;o long cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The lighte&s;t cen&s;ure with which any of the&s;e &s;chemes for alteration can be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, is that it is a refine|ment totally u&s;ele&s;s, if it fail in the ends for which it is recommended to us; and one great end mu&s;t be, to bring about a proportional divi&s;ion of all public burthens, particularly contributions to the public &s;er|vice: it is otherwi&s;e, at be&s;t, a parade of de&s;ign and accuracy, without u&s;e; a great movement, without a motive. But it is to tho&s;e who make u&s;e of the&s;e well-&s;ounding maxims, as pretences to &s;creen other motives which it is not &s;o convenient to avow, that the remainder of this ob&s;ervation, and that which fol|lows it, are directed.</P>
<P>When changes of this kind are called for, planned to fortify old abu&s;es with new &s;trength, and &s;ting into the hands of tho&s;e who have always &s;upported them, powers to add to their weight, men feel them|&s;elves in&s;ulted as well as injured: they &s;ee that the realities of public principle and ju&s;tice are &s;acrificed to the mockery of proportion and &s;peculative equa|lity; and that a &s;y&s;tem called by the name of a reform, under a delu&s;ive pretence of &s;trengthening public liberty, and putting a nece&s;&s;ary weight into the popular &s;cale, &s;lips at clande&s;tinely into that of inequality and oppre&s;&s;ion, already more loaded than a decent &s;el|fi&s;hne&s;s would wi&s;h. But the pre&s;ent example of a neighbouring nation, and that of our own in the mid|dle of the la&s;t century, &s;how that the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s which hypocri&s;y has taught to wear the ma&s;k of pa|trioti&s;m, &s;trides over all ordinary bounds.</P>
<P>It is not only ju&s;tice that &s;uffers thus; the &s;pirit of
<PB N="123" REF="126">
liberty it&s;elf &s;uffers with it. Great and good princi|ples, which have taken deep root in the character of a nation, are mo&s;t liable to be de&s;troyed by abu&s;e, by being practi&s;ed upon by an in&s;idious policy, for its own crooked ends, and being excited to the wildne&s;s and folly of fanatici&s;m: for every great principle has both its fanatics, real and hypocritical, and its fana|tici&s;m. In&s;tead of a fire regularly and fully fed, it may be kindled into a conflagration, which de&s;troys every thing in its neighbourhood, devours its own magazines; and, amid&s;t the ruin which it &s;preads round, hardly a &s;park may be found to &s;urvive, co|vered up in the embers. Our hi&s;tory in the la&s;t cen|tury furni&s;hed more than one example of this; and it will be the happine&s;s of the pre&s;ent, if our po&s;terity has to recur &s;o far back as to that period, for &s;uch do|me&s;tic in&s;tances. In the reign of Charles I. the prin|ciple of loyalty had been over&s;trained, to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of the Court: when the civil war and all its calamities might have been prevented by its con&s;titu|tional exertions, it was found to be too much ex|hau&s;ted.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of liberty, who&s;e increa&s;e at fir&s;t was nece&s;&s;ary, to oppo&s;e the overgrown and formidable prerogatives of the Crown, ran into a contemptible and wild enthu&s;ia&s;m: by its extravagances, it almo&s;t lo&s;t all hold of the affections of the people; and at the return of Charles II. the virtue of his mini&s;ter prevented parliament from making an entire &s;acrifice of the national freedom, by conferring upon the &s;o|vereign a fixed revenue, which would have made him for ever independent of that a&s;&s;embly. The &s;obriety of manners, and &s;erious attachment to religion, which &s;o honourably di&s;tingui&s;hed the Engli&s;h in the begin|ning of the century, had been very generally deba&s;ed, during the civil wars, into a puritanical hypocri&s;y:
<PB N="124" REF="127">
and at the Re&s;toration, public decency appeared almo&s;t &s;wept away, by a torrent of profligacy and irreligion. Here it is &s;een, that the &s;ame phy&s;ical law &s;eems to affect &s;ociety, to which individuals are &s;ubjected: immoderate elevation proceeds, and cau&s;es a depre&s;&s;ion in an equal degree; or to make u&s;e of the language of medicine, a &s;tate of excitation is con|&s;tantly followed by a &s;tate of collap&s;e. The &s;pirit of liberty &s;hould always be vigilantly pre&s;erved in a full and regulated degree: but when it is artificially &s;ti|mulated into fanatici&s;m, to &s;erve mean and oppre&s;&s;ive purpo&s;es, the contempt with which the end only ought to be &s;urveyed, becomes, with the generality of mankind, attached to the in&s;trument employed to bring it about; and the meaner the motives an o&s;tentatious affectation of it is made a &s;creen to, the more it will be degraded in the general opinion. The national attachment to liberty is in danger enough, from the abu&s;e of its name, to carry on purpo&s;es inimical to the regulations and exi&s;tence of civil &s;ociety: and if it be further perverted, to procure the creation of new powers, to protect a lucrative &s;y&s;tem of inju&s;tice, and to add more weight to its oppre&s;&s;ion, it may be pro|nounced, that its extinction is not far di&s;tant.</P>
<P>One very important que&s;tion on this &s;ubject &s;till remains to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed: and that is, how will the intere&s;t of the public creditors, and the whole cla&s;s of men who&s;e income is derived from the profit of &s;tock, be affected by the landed intere&s;t of the remote coun|ties acquiring an additional power in the Hou&s;e of Commons?</P>
<P>By the plans for this alteration here examined, the weight of the landed intere&s;t in the Hou&s;e will be greatly increa&s;ed. If &s;eventy-two members for counties were &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of the &s;ame number for boroughs; its weight will be very con&s;iderably augmented, al|though
<PB N="125" REF="128">
twenty-eight members were admitted, for the more populous unrepre&s;ented towns.</P>
<P>But there is no occa&s;ion to employ much con&s;ide|ration upon this, as the plan for the ab&s;olute &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of boroughs &s;eems abandoned. If they be left in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, and any number of members be added to the counties, the addition to the landed intere&s;t in the Hou&s;e will dimini&s;h the relative im|portance of that of the other two&mdash;the mercantile and the monied men. If the mode of election in boroughs be changed, by admitting more of their inhabitants to have votes, it will not tend to counter-balance the increa&s;e of weight the landed intere&s;t will acquire as above: but if that change be made, by admitting the inhabitants of the circumjacent coun|try, of any de&s;cription, to votes in a borough, it will give &s;ome further &s;uperiority to the landed inte|re&s;t.</P>
<P>By the equalization of the land-tax, &s;uch an addi|tion may be made to the applicable &s;inking fund, that it will very &s;oon, by its own operation, become what has been called, in this E&s;&s;ay, an adequate fund. It has been &s;hown to be the property of that fund, that while it is applied to the extinction of ca|pital, a debt cea&s;es to increa&s;e periodically; or the additions made to it in every war are paid off in peace. By the operations of &s;uch a fund, it is evi|dent, that the price of &s;tock would be &s;upported, both in peace and war, at a rate much higher than at pre&s;ent can permanently take place. Hence the value of the funded income of that great body of the public creditors, the proprietors of the 3 per cent. &s;tocks, and the irredeemable annuities, will be very greatly increa&s;ed; while the intere&s;t of capitals in trade will be reduced; and that great cla&s;s of men will be benefited by &s;ome moderate increa&s;e of profit,
<PB N="126" REF="129">
and by a new facility of obtaining capital, whenever an opportunity of employing a greater to advantage, pre&s;ents it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the con&s;equences of a revenue acquired by an equalization of the tax, &s;o applied: it is the only apparent anchor of the national hope; ju&s;tice demands it from the landed proprietors of the remote di&s;trict: they them&s;elves will be great &s;harers of the benefit which the public may thus receive from it; and &s;o far the expence of their &s;acrifice will be le&s;|&s;ened: but I think an enlightened attachment to the good of their country ought to make them pre&s;erve it for this purpo&s;e, to give it up on no other condition.</P>
<P>But if, before the equalization be obtained, the commercial intere&s;t and the public creditors concur in any plan for the alteration of the repre&s;entation, which adds to the majority of the members of the remote di&s;trict in the Hou&s;e of Commons, they render it ap|parently impo&s;&s;ible, and de&s;troy the foundation of their be&s;t hopes. No bodies of men exi&s;t, who&s;e intere&s;t at this juncture &s;hould lead them more &s;trongly to oppo&s;e the alteration of the con&s;titution of the Commons, than the inhabitants of our commercial cities and towns, both in the home and remote di|&s;trict, together with the great majority of our public creditors: and perhaps it would be difficult to fix upon a mea&s;ure which it was more their intere&s;t to unite all their &s;trength again&s;t.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE I.</HI> On the Proportion of the Values of the Land, contained in the Home and Remote Di&s;tricts of England.&mdash;Al&s;o, on the Sum the latter ought to pay to the Land-Tax, in Proportion to the actual Charge thereof upon the former; the nominal Rate of the Tax being at Four Shillings in the Pound.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IN the preceding tract, the kingdom is taken as divided into two great di&s;tricts; and the proportion of their value is there a&s;&s;igned, from the be&s;t elements I could procure.</P>
<P N="2">2. An account is here to be given of the&s;e fundamental elements, and of the mode by which this proportion has been deduced from them. The fir&s;t, or that which is called the Home Di&s;trict, comprehends the eleven home counties, and that of Middle&s;ex; London being excluded: that named the Remote Di&s;trict, includes the remaining counties of England and Wales.</P>
<P N="3">3. The total number of acres in the &s;everal counties, and in the whole kingdom, are taken from the account given by the celebrated Dr. Halley, in Houghton's Tracts.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hu&s;bandry and Trade improved, v. 1. No. 25. It is from this account that all the mea&s;ures of quantities of land in this Appendix are taken.</NOTE> This account (though there are &s;ome exceptions again&s;t it, which certainly mu&s;t be allowed their weight) is the be&s;t &s;urvey of the quantity of land in the kingdom, which has
<PB N="2" REF="132">
fallen into my hands. By &s;umming up the contents of every county, he found the kingdom to contain 39.938 ms. of acres. By a &s;econd and different operation upon a map on a &s;maller &s;cale, he determined that area to be 38.66 ms. of acres: and con&s;iders the difference as not important. Mr. Gregory King (who&s;e re&s;earches in political arith|metic are de&s;ervedly held in the fir&s;t degree of e&s;teem) &s;tated it at 39 ms. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davenant. v. 2. p 216.</NOTE> of acres: if he di&s;covered this amount, by an original operation of his own, it is a proof that the conclu&s;ion of Dr. Halley is very near the truth; if he was his copyi&s;t only, he gives his own authority to that account, which has very great weight. Dr. Nehemiah Grew examined a &s;econd and ancient account of the con|tents of all the counties, by which that of the whole king|dom appears to be 39&frac14; ms. of acres. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Motte's Abridgement of Phil. Tran&s;actions. P. 41. ch. 3. art. 8.</NOTE> This is a di&s;tinct and independent proof, that the e&s;timate of Dr. Halley <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is evident, from the words of Dr. Grew, 1&s;t, That the account here referred to, is not that of Dr. Halley; and 2d, That he did not know of the exi&s;tence of the latter.</NOTE> approaches very nearly to the truth; the contents of the kingdom, from the mean of his two operations, being 39.299 ms. of acres. Dr. Grew has al&s;o, in the &s;ame paper, given a method of his own, to approximate to that quantity; but it is founded on an a&s;&s;umption &s;o gro&s;s and ill-adapted to the purpo&s;e, that its re&s;ult is not to be &s;et again&s;t that of Dr. Halley, as confirmed by concurring authorities. He makes the contents of the kingdom to exceed, by a &s;mall quantity, 46 ms. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Grew in Philo&s;. Tran&s;. ubi &s;upra.</NOTE> of acres. By &s;ome mode of proceeding, equally erroneous, Sir William Petty reduces that amount to 28 ms. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Grew in Philo&s;. Tran&s;. ubi &s;upra.</NOTE> but the mean of the&s;e extreme e&s;timates is 37 ms.; and it tends, as far as &s;uch a mean can be evidence, to confirm the account of Dr. Halley; who ob&s;erves, that, in his time, the be&s;t maps did not agree to a million or two of acres.</P>
<P N="4">4. It appears from this table of the contents of the &s;everal counties, that the home di&s;trict contains 8.253 ms. and the remote di&s;tricts 31.685 ms. of acres. And the contents of the former being taken as 10,000; tho&s;e of the latter will be as 38,392.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="3" REF="133">5. It was ob&s;erved above, that &s;ome exceptions may be taken again&s;t the mechanical approximations u&s;ed by Dr. Halley, in a&s;&s;igning the contents of the counties, which mu&s;t be allowed to have their weight. In determining the proportion of two &s;mall counties by this mode, an error of &s;ome con&s;ideration may ari&s;e: but this will not &s;en&s;ibly affect the truth of the conclu&s;ion given above; for if the contents of two &s;mall tracts of land, containing two &s;uch counties each, be compared together, the error in their proportion will be le&s;s, than in the compari&s;on of &s;uch counties &s;ingle; and if there be 7, 8, or 9 &s;uch counties compri&s;ed in each di&s;trict, it will become in&s;ignificant; and the re&s;ult may be taken as true to all practical pur|po&s;es. In like manner, in determining the area of a &s;ingle county, if it be very large, the probability of error will be reduced in proportion to its &s;ize. In increa&s;ing the number of counties in each di&s;trict, we approach nearer and nearer to ab&s;olute truth in the&s;e proportions; in the &s;ame manner, and for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, as in multiplying the number of a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations, to obtain a correct average: its error decrea&s;es rapidly, as their number in|crea&s;es; and it &s;oon arrives at the greate&s;t degree of accu|racy that can po&s;&s;ibly be required in u&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. We are now to endeavour to determine, as near as may be, the proportion which the rents of the two di&s;tricts bear to each other.</P>
<P N="7">7. If their rent be taken to be, as the total number of acres in each, it is evident that the remote divi&s;ion will be e&s;timated con&s;iderably too high.</P>
<P N="8">8. But it mu&s;t be admitted, that this di&s;trict has in|crea&s;ed in riches, with more celerity than the re&s;t of the kingdom. The number of its inhabitants likewi&s;e exceeds that of the home counties, in a con&s;iderably greater de|gree than it did a century ago: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not a&s;&s;umed here, that an actual increa&s;e of the number of the people in either of the&s;e di&s;tricts, has taken place &s;ince the Revo|lution. I am not entering the li&s;ts with the &s;turdy advocates for depo|pulation. If the number of inhabitants of the remote di&s;trict have con|tinued the &s;ame, while tho&s;e of the home counties have decrea&s;ed; or if the former have decrea&s;ed, with any a&s;&s;ignable degree of celerity, and the latter with a greater; what is laid down in the text remains true.</NOTE> being therefore relatively increa&s;ed in wealth and population; it follows, that if the
<PB N="4" REF="134">
value of the two di&s;tricts be taken as their re&s;pective number of inhabitants in 1690; that of the remote di&s;trict in this &s;econd mode, will be e&s;timated con&s;iderably too low: therefore, let it be here a&s;&s;umed, that the error of exce&s;s in that value, determined in the fir&s;t mode, is nearly equal to that of defect in the &s;econd; and that the mean of both approaches very near to the true value.</P>
<P N="9">9. The proportion of the population of the&s;e di&s;tricts in 1690, is now to be found; and this may be done, from that valuable account of the number of hou&s;es in each county, given by Dr. Davenant, from the hearth books. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davenant, v. 1. p. 39. It is from this table that the number of hou&s;es, and the land-tax of each county, are con&s;tantly taken in the&s;e computations.</NOTE></P>
<P N="10">10. It is nece&s;&s;ary in this computation, to leave out the number of hou&s;es contained in London; as the land-tax of that city will not be brought to account, in the e&s;timate of the payment of the home di&s;trict.</P>
<P N="11">11. The number of hou&s;es in the county of Middle&s;ex, (exclu&s;ive of London) is not &s;eparately given, in the ac|count referred to; but it mu&s;t have nearly borne that pro|portion to the number of acres it contains; which took place at that time, between the quantity of land and num|ber of hou&s;es, in the counties of E&s;&s;ex, Kent, Surrey, and Hertford, taken together; they being contiguous to it, and, in other circum&s;tances, &s;imilarly &s;ituated. Now, the contents of the four counties are 3.531 ms. of acres; and the number of hou&s;es, 145,317; whence the number of acres in Middle&s;ex being 247,000, the proportional num|ber of hou&s;es to be a&s;&s;igned to that county, is 10, 164. To avoid a repetition of the &s;teps of this proce&s;s in another place, I add here, that the land-tax of the 4 counties being &pound;.284,302, that of Middle&s;ex, exclu&s;ive of London, is found by the &s;ame method to be &pound;. 19,887.</P>
<P N="12">12. The number of hou&s;es of the 7 remaining counties of the home di&s;trict, were 190,226; and tho&s;e of the whole divi&s;ion, 345,707; the number in the remote di|&s;trict, by the &s;ame table, was 872,457. Hence, by the &s;econd &s;uppo&s;ition, the value of the two di&s;tricts is as tho&s;e numbers re&s;pectively: or that of the home di&s;trict being taken as 10,000; that of the remote di&s;trict appears to be as 25,237.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="5" REF="135">13. It was &s;hewn above, that, if their proportional values be taken at the quantity of land in each, they will be as 10,000 and 38,392 re&s;pectively: and it was al&s;o a&s;&s;umed, that the error of exce&s;s in the proportion of the remote counties, by that mode of e&s;timation, is nearly equal to the error of defect in this; and therefore, that the mean of the two is very near the truth. Thus, the value of the home di&s;trict is to that of the remote, as 10,000 to 31,814 nearly; and to that of the whole kingdom, as 10,000 to 41,814.</P>
<P N="14">14. To confirm this conclu&s;ion, the proportion of the rents of the two di&s;tricts are now to be determined in ano|ther mode. Both of them contain many and con&s;iderable uncultivated tracts of land; and as profitable land is the only &s;ubject of taxation, in order to determine how far the land-tax upon each is proportioned to its value or rent, the profitable land in each di&s;trict ought to be known. Upon the authority of Mr. Young, the land in cultivation, in the whole kingdom, is here taken at 32 ms. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chalmers, p. 178.</NOTE> of acres; and thus the quantity of land at pre&s;ent lying wa&s;te in both di&s;tricts, amounts to 7.938 ms. of acres; but I have di&s;covered no direct authority, to determine the quantity of profitable land in either. It is therefore here a&s;&s;umed, as an hypothe&s;is, that if, of a tract in the home di&s;trict, of a given magnitude, a certain number of acres upon an ave|rage ought to be allowed as wa&s;te land; and in the &s;ame quantity in the remote di&s;trict, treble of that allowance, and deduction be upon an average made; the value of equal proportions of land, of the two remainders, will, upon the average, be equal. From this a&s;&s;umption it follows, that nearly 1-13th of the whole, or 7,684 acres in every 100,000, is to be taken as uncultivated land; and in the remote divi|&s;ion, 23,054 acres, in every equal tract; or nearly 3-13ths of the whole. The wa&s;te land in the home di&s;trict, will then amount to 634,200 acres, and the profitable land to 7.619 ms. of acres; and in the remote di&s;trict, the uncul|tivated land will be 7.304 ms. and the land under culti|vation, 24.381 ms. of acres; making the quantity of cultivated land in both, 32.000 ms. of acres, as above.</P>
<P N="15">15. Hence the value of the home di&s;trict being taken as 100,000, that of the remote di&s;trict will be as 320,002;
<PB N="6" REF="136">
and of the whole kingdom as 420,002; for 7.619 ms. is to 24.381 ms. as 100,000 is to 320,002. By the former proce&s;s, it had been found, that taking the value of the home di&s;trict as 10,000, that of the remote divi&s;ion is as 31,814; and of the whole kingdom as 41,814; which conclu&s;ions agree &s;ufficiently well.</P>
<P N="16">16. If the proportion of wa&s;te land, in equal tracts, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davenant, v. 1. p. 39.</NOTE> in the home and remote di&s;tricts, had been taken as unity and four re&s;pectively; then every 100,000 acres in the home divi&s;ion, would have been found to contain 5,880 acres of wa&s;te; and in the remote di&s;trict, 23,523; and the value of the former di&s;trict being taken as 10,000, that of the latter will be 31,198; which agrees &s;till nearer with the re&s;ult of the fir&s;t proce&s;s.</P>
<P N="17">17. The &s;ums actually paid on account of this tax by the two di&s;tricts, and their proportional charges, are now to be compared. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davenant, v. 1. p. 39.</NOTE> Davenant has given the produce of every county to the fir&s;t 4-&s;hilling aid, granted in the 4th year of William and Mary; the variations which have &s;ince taken place, are too minute to be con&s;idered here. It appears from his table, that the charge upon the home counties (London and Middle&s;ex being excluded), was &pound;.632,388. The &s;um paid by that county, exclu&s;ive of Lon|don, was before &s;hewn to be nearly &pound;.19,887: the amount of the land-tax for the home counties is therefore &pound;.652,275; which &s;um, as appears above, is to the proportional charge upon the remote di&s;trict, as 10,000 to 31,814: the pro|portional charge upon that di&s;trict, is therefore &pound;.2,075,100 nearly; exceeding its actual payment &pound;.1,038,184, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davenant, v. 1. p. 39.</NOTE> by &pound;.1,036,916.</P>

And this may be very well taken to be the &s;ame as that of the cotemporary amounts of the entire national rent. Hence the rents of the land of England, for the years 1693 and 1793, are fir&s;t to be &s;ought.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus Mr. King made the aggregate of all the&s;e rents of e&s;tates real 13 ms. pounds; for per&s;onal e&s;tates, chargeable al&s;o to the land-tax, he added one million more; &s;tating the total &s;o chargeable at 14 ms. pounds. Davenant, v. 2. p. 216. This latter &s;um, Dave|nant mi&s;took for the national rent of 1688, and gives it as &s;uch. P. 221. But in&s;tances of con&s;iderable error are not unu&s;ual in that writer: this has been copied from him by the generality of authors &s;ince.</NOTE> The&s;e are to be derived from the rents of the years 1688 and 1774; which have been a&s;certained, with more accuracy than tho&s;e of any other terms. In the former, the rent of the land of England, or the rent of &s;uperior conditions, was &s;tated by Mr. King (the be&s;t political arithmetician this kingdom has ever produced) at 10 mil|lions; and tho&s;e of buildings, mines, and other heredita|ments, being rents of inferior condition, at 3 millions. It is evident, by his e&s;timate of the amount of the landed capital, as pre&s;erved by Davenant, that he rated the value of the&s;e inferior rents as equal to that of a landed income of 2 millions of &s;uperior condition: <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This point has been carefully examined; the &s;everal elements he made u&s;e of, and the re&s;ults he obtained from them, are to be found &s;cattered, in &s;eparate e&s;&s;ays of Davenant; but without any reference to the proce&s;s, of which they are a part. A proof of this po&s;ition is much too long to be given here. I &s;hall add, however, a circum&s;tance, which I think tended to determine him to take the value of the 2 &s;pecies of real income, in the proportion of 3 to 2. I have been informed, that, in the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;inents of pari&s;hes, Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Hale directed lands to be laid at 3-4ths of the rack-rent, and buildings at one-half. And &s;uch a rate &s;o formed, was confirmed by Lord Mansfield, in the ca&s;e of K. and Brograve, M. 10. G. III. Now 3-4ths is to 1-half, as 3 to 2. It was po&s;&s;ibly upon the authority of Hale, that Mr. King adopted this proportion of the value of equal rents from land, and buildings without land; and took it as holding true of other rents of inferior condition. This opinion would have great weight with him, as Sir Matthew Hale had applied him&s;elf to political arithmetic, as appears by the ob&s;ervations he has left upon population. He died in 1676. The work referred to was publi&s;hed 1677 (Chalmers, p. 183); and upon that &s;ubject, Mr. King mu&s;t have con&s;idered him as his immediate predece&s;&s;or.</NOTE> the value, of &s;uch rents being thus reduced in the market for income, upon
<PB N="8" REF="138">
account of the inferior nature of the &s;ubject from whence they re&s;ult; hence the whole rent, being in value equal to 12 millions a year in land, ought to be taxed as an income of 12 millions is only.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the year 1774, Mr. Young e&s;timated the rents of land, or tho&s;e of &s;uperior condition, at &pound;. 19.2 ms. and the rents of inferior condition, as buildings, &amp;c. at &pound;. 5.2 ms. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chalmers, p. 178.</NOTE> From the latter &s;um, 1.733 ms. or 1-3d, is to be &s;ubtracted as before; and the remainder, &pound;. 3.466 ms. will be the equi|valent income of &s;uperior condition: the taxable rent was therefore 22.666 ms.</P>
<P N="4">4. From the&s;e rents of 1688 and 1774, thus reduced to a proper form, tho&s;e of the years 1693 and 1793 are to be determined: in order to this, let it be admitted, that in the whole interval from 1688 to 1774, or during 86 years, that equal rents, upon an average, increa&s;ed equal &s;ums, in equal times; or, which is the con&s;equence thereof, that the national rent increa&s;ed at any equal rate per cent. annually: that rate is now to be &s;ought. The rent of 1688, &pound;. 12.000 ms. multiplied by 1.8888, is equal to &pound;. 22.6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">6 ms. that of 1774. Now there intervened 86 years between tho&s;e terms; and 1.00742, rai&s;ed to the 86th power, is equal to 1.8888: hence the annual average augment of rent for that term, was &pound;. 0.742 or nearly &frac34; per cent. From 1688 to 1693, there elap&s;ed 5 years; and the rent being &s;uppo&s;ed to have increa&s;ed annually, in the ratio a&s;&s;igned above, became in the year 1693 (&pound;. 12.000 ms. &times; 1.00742^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">=12.000 &times; 1.0376) &pound;. 12.451 ms.

Now it is evident, con&s;idered in every point of view, that the improvements of the remote di&s;tricts have advanced with greater celerity than tho&s;e of the re&s;t of the kingdom: and the increa&s;e of rent, from the natural connection between general improvement and the improvement of land, has gone on in the &s;ame manner. Hence the rents of that di&s;trict have increa&s;ed, with a greater rate of celerity,
<PB N="9" REF="139">
than the total national rent. But let them be taken by the a&s;&s;umption laid down above, to have increa&s;ed only in the &s;ame proportion. Then the rent of that divi&s;ion in 1693, being taken as 12.451, that of 1793 is as 26.085: its land-tax in 1693 was &pound;. 1,038,184: and it will be as 12.451 is to 26.085, &s;o is &pound;. 1,038,184 to &pound;. 2,174,500. And the&s;e two &s;ums being as the rents of the home di&s;trict in the years 1693 and 1793; the burthen of the former upon the landlords in 1693, was equal to what the bur|then of the latter would be upon the landlords in 1793; if their charge to the land-tax were to amount to the latter &s;um.</P>
<P N="5">5.

<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE V.</HI> On the Number of Members to be returned to the Hou&s;e of Commons in future, from the Counties of the Remote Di&s;trict, according to certain propo&s;ed Alterations in its Con&s;titution.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. BY the plan for the change of the con&s;titution of the Hou&s;e of Commons, brought forward in 1785, the number of the members for counties was to have been increa&s;ed by 72; and it would thus have amounted to 164. It is taken here as granted, that this plan, if carried into execution, will be effected, by &s;o increa&s;ing the number of repre&s;en|tatives for each county, that it will become, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, proportional to its value. And although for a &s;ingle county, we cannot approach nearer that proportion than its next integer number; yet if many counties be taken as forming a large di&s;trict, the new number of mem|bers to be allotted to it, taken collectively, may be made to be extremely nearly proportional to the aggregate value of the di&s;trict formed by them. Hence the total number of county members, now to repre&s;ent the remote divi&s;ion, (the value of which &s;omewhat exceeds 3-4ths of the whole lands of the kingdom), might, and would, by the new arrangement, be made very accurately proportional to that value.

<P><PB N="13" REF="143">A detailed account of the authorities on which this table is founded, would be much too long for this place; the average actual amount of the tax in each term of war and peace, together with the nominal rates, are here a&s;&s;igned; after an accurate examination and compari&s;on of the data to be found in the authors named in the margin. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davenant; Po&s;tlewayte, in his Hi&s;tory of the Revenue; Dr. Price; and Sir John Sinclair. The fir&s;t and la&s;t of the periodical charges are &s;he only articles of the table here treated on: it was not drawn out on this occa&s;ion; but I have cho&s;en to give it entire and unmutilated; as it &s;hews the progre&s;&s;ive amounts of the tax.</NOTE> The &s;everal &s;ums include the expences of collection.</P>
<P N="2">2. The nature and determination of the amounts in the third greater column, called the Periodical Average Charge, or of the &s;maller column which follows it, being the &s;ame average of the nominal rate of the tax, require an expla|nation; the former being the ba&s;es of the calculation now to be entered upon.</P>
<P N="3">3. The periodical average, either of the actual charge, or nominal rate of the tax for any term; as for in&s;tance, that of the peace of 1748; is found in this &s;ame manner: that is, by multiplying the annual average payment, or rate of the term, by the mean length of a term of peace; and that, annual payment, or rate, during the preceding war, by the mean number of years in a term of war; and dividing the &s;um of the products, by the number of years comprehended in one period, con&s;i&s;ting of a term of war and a term of peace, each of the mean length. This may be illu&s;trated in the in&s;tance of the nominal rate of the tax, for the term mentioned above. During the peace of 1748, this rate was at two &s;hillings and &s;ixpence in the pound: and taking the mean length of a term of peace at 10 years (which, though not accurately true, as will be &s;een hereafter, is near enough for the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, which is that of mere illu&s;tration), the product formed by the multiplication of the rate and the term, will be 25 &s;hillings. Again, the con&s;tant nominal rate of the tax in the war of 1739, which immediately preceded this peace, was 4 &s;hillings in the pound; and taking the mean dura|tion of war at 8 years, which is likewi&s;e near enough to the truth, the product will be 32s. and the &s;um of the pro|duct 57s. The &s;um of the length of the two terms is 18 years; by which dividing the &s;um of the products, the
<PB N="14" REF="144">
average nominal rate for the whole period (determined on the above a&s;&s;umptions), is 3s. and 2 pence. And by a &s;imilar proce&s;s, the periodical charge for the whole period may be determined.</P>
<P N="4">4. And &s;uppo&s;ing the average length of peace and war duly a&s;&s;igned above; as they are &s;ufficiently nearly for the purpo&s;es of illu&s;tration; it is evident, that this is the no|minal rate at which the charge of the tax upon land ought to have been then allowed, in all treaties of bargain and &s;ale at that time; for its true charge upon any e&s;tate, could not be e&s;timated for the future, at either the one or the other rate; the one being too great, and the other too &s;mall; but by a mean, properly taken between both.</P>
<P N="5">5. Amounts thus calculated for each term of peace and war, ought to be reckoned (according to the equality of chance) the true average charge of the tax upon the king|dom at that time; the accidental exce&s;s of one period, being always compen&s;ated with an accidental alleviation at another.</P>
<P N="6">6. The average length of a war is very nearly 8&frac12; years; and of a term of peace, 10&frac12;. For the &s;um of the lengths of our five great wars &s;ince the Revolution, was exactly 43 years; computed from the month in which they effectively commenced, to that in which they effectively terminated. And if the peace of Utrecht had continued uninterrupted until the commencement of the war of 1739, the length of the 4 intermediate terms of peace would have been 51 years and 2 months. But the Rebellion in 1715, and the petty ho&s;tilities with Spain in 1718, 1726, and 1733, may be taken together, as adding 4 years to the duration of the 5 wars, and increa&s;ing the number of terms by the fraction one half. Thus the total number of years of war are 47, equal to the duration of 5&frac12; terms; and the mean length of a war is 8&middot;54 years, to be taken at 8&frac12; years. The number of years of peace is reduced to 47 years and 1-6th, or 2 months; the number of terms increa&s;ed by a half, becomes 4&frac12;; and the mean length of a term of peace 10 48, to be taken at 10&frac12; years. Now 19 years being the di&s;tance from the commencement of one term of peace to that of the following, is here called a period; and the averages of the land-tax for 19 years, are named periodical averages.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="15" REF="145">7. But during the fir&s;t year of every peace, the land-tax has always been continued at 4 &s;hillings in the pound, or at the rate of the preceding war; it is therefore effectively, with re&s;pect to the tax, a year of war; wherefore, in the table, the terms of the duration of the tax in war and peace, are taken as having been equal.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This accidental circum&s;tance of their equality, is purpo&s;ely neglected in the illu&s;tration given in &sect; 3.</NOTE></P>
<P N="8">8. The periodical charge of the tax during the peace of Ri&s;wyck, is &s;tated in the table at &pound;.1.5452 ms.; and its nominal rate at 3s. and 2&frac12;d. in the pound; the middle of that term fell in the beginning of the year 1700: we are to find what was the charge of the tax upon the whole kingdom in that year, exclu&s;ive of London; and hence determine what it would amount to in the pre&s;ent year; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Written Dec. 1792.</NOTE> upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that it had increa&s;ed during the whole of this century, with the &s;ame celerity as the rent. The land-tax of London and Middle&s;ex, at 4s. in the pound, is &pound;. 307,140; <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Davenant, v. 1. p. 39.</NOTE> and that of Middle&s;ex, &pound;. 19,887, as above. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 1. &sect; 11.</NOTE> The tax upon London, therefore, amounts to &pound;. 287,254, at 4s. in the pound; and at 3s. and 2&frac12;d. (the periodical rate in 1700), to &pound;. 230,399; and that of the provinces, to &pound;. 1,314,899.</P>
<P N="9">9. This charge is to be &s;uppo&s;ed to have increa&s;ed with the &s;ame celerity as the rent, or &pound;. 1 at the end of one year to be increa&s;ed to &pound;. 1.00742. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 2. &sect; 4.</NOTE> At the end of 92 years, it will become (&pound;. 1.00742^9^2), &pound;. 1.9745; and the whole tax on the counties (1.9745&times; &pound;.1.3148 ms.=) &pound;. 2.5960 ms.</P>
<P N="10">10. The periodical and actual land tax of Great-Britain, at this time, is &pound;. 2.0142 ms.; the rate, 4 &s;hillings in the pound: that of Scotland, &pound;. 0.052 ms. of London &pound;. 0.2872 ms. and that of the counties &pound;. 1 6750 ms. Now this charge falls &s;hort of the &s;um, found above to be proportional to the ri&s;e of rents, in the fir&s;t. 92 years of this century, by &pound;. 921,000. The remote di&s;trict now pays &pound;. 1.0369 ms. annually, le&s;s than its due propor|tion, according to the pre&s;ent con&s;tant rate of the tax; and
<PB N="16" REF="146">
if the proprietors thereof were to take this augmentation entirely upon them&s;elves, that defalcation would &s;till con|tinue to be &pound;. 115,900 a year.</P>
<P N="11">11. It may be contended again&s;t the whole of what is here laid down, that <Q>in treaties for the &s;ale of land, this periodical average never comes into con&s;ideration: that it never has been, even eventually, the actual mea&s;ure of the charge, for any real period of war and peace. And in fine, that it is an amount never con&s;idered in &s;peculation; and which never becomes the actual mea&s;ure of the charge in fact.</Q> To this it is an&s;wered, that for the rea&s;on given above, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Section IV. of this Article.</NOTE> the charge of no one year in particular, either of war or peace, or the average of no one term of either can be a&s;&s;umed as the con&s;tant mea&s;ure of this charge; therefore an average is to be taken in &s;ome other manner; which mu&s;t be &s;uch as, upon the equality of chance, will approach neare&s;t to the truth; and this is the property of the periodical average above a&s;&s;igned. This certainly is not nece&s;&s;arily the real or eventual average; and perhaps not that mo&s;t frequently adopted in treaties, or the &s;peculative average: but it is notwith&s;tanding the probable average; and, as &s;uch, ought to &s;uper&s;ede the other two in u&s;e. Any mean taken in any other manner, mu&s;t in long terms be found erroneous: and this is gene|rally true, of the mean taken from the actual length of two a&s;&s;igned &s;ucce&s;&s;ive terms of war and peace.</P>
<P N="12">12. But let the actual average of the war of the Revolu|tion, and the following peace, be now made the ba&s;is of computation, as the proper periodical average; and it will be found, that the conclu&s;ion before derived, is not invalidated thereby; the mean annual amount of the tax, which was paid for 6 years in the war of the Revolution, was &pound;. 1.832 ms. the &s;um of the 6 nominal rates 23s. that of the 1&s;t year having been 3s. in the pound. In the fol|lowing peace, which continued 4 years, its amount was &pound;. 1.2585 ms. and the &s;um of the 4 rates was 11s. there|fore the actual mean payment of the&s;e 10 years for all England, was &pound;. 1.6026 ms. and the mean nominal rate 3 &s;hillings 3.3/10 The tax of London was &pound;. 0.2369 ms. and the charge on the remainder of the kingdom &pound;. 1.3657 ms. which augmented as before, in the proportion of

THE amount of the taxes of England (the land-tax excluded), is fir&s;t to be &s;hewn; and as the&s;e taxes may fall on the whole &s;ociety in general, they are here called the general taxes. We are next to enquire, what part thereof is paid by income from land; the fund for the payment of all taxes, being income of &s;ome kind or other. That part being found, its charge upon the two di&s;tricts &s;everally will be determined; and the general taxes paid by each, its payments to the land-tax (which falls on landed income alone), being added, the total tax of the landlords of each di&s;trict will be obtained; and its proportion to their re&s;pective incomes may be a&s;&s;igned. Moreover, if we compute the ab&s;olute rent of each di&s;trict; the &s;um of the general taxes, the land-tax, and the total of both being before found, the charge of each of the&s;e in the pound, in both divi&s;ions, will be found likewi&s;e.</P>

<P N="4">4. The amount of the general taxes paid out of the anded income, is now to be &s;ought, together with the charge upon the two di&s;tricts &s;eparately.

the general taxes upon each cla&s;s, will be as its total ex|penditure; which is to be taken to be in the &s;ame propor|tion to its gro&s;s income in each. And la&s;tly, let it be al&s;o admitted, that the total income of the di&s;trict bears the &s;ame proportion to the total income of the nation, which was determined by Mr. King to obtain in 1688. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I find that the application of the calculations and re&s;ults of Mr. King, frequently made in this tract, is ju&s;tified by the uniform practice of tho&s;e, who have treated on &s;ubjects &s;imilar to this, becau&s;e they were interwoven in the body of Davenant's works, they are frequently referred to as his: and Po&s;tlethwayt, &s;peaking of them as &s;uch, &s;ays; <Q>The quantities are &s;ince, no doubt, con&s;iderably increa&s;ed: but, as, mo&s;t probably, the proportion remains very little (nearly) unal|tered, it is fair to argue upon them, as has been done by the be&s;t writers upon the&s;e &s;ubjects.</Q> Dictionary, Article Landed Intere&s;t, column 4th, line 9th, edition 3d, 1766.

<P N="5">5. The actual income of the two di&s;tricts in 1688, mu&s;t therefore be a&s;&s;igned. When it was before enquired, what proportion of the tax the remote di&s;trict could equitably pay; the &s;elling value of the e&s;tates in each, or the rent of e&s;tates of equal value in land, or of the be&s;t condition, was taken as the proper mea&s;ure by which to e&s;timate that ability: the e&s;tates of inferior condition, as buildings and mines, being reduced to landed income of equal value. But here the que&s;tion is, what is actually paid from in|comes of e&s;tates real, of all qualities, all being equally a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, without regarding that better or wor&s;e condition; but their amount only for the compari&s;on is now actual income and actual taxes. The income of all the e&s;tates real in the kingdom, in 1681, was 13 millions; and of build|ings, two millions: now, from this amount, the rent of London is to be deducted, which being taken in that year at one million, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A very con&s;iderable part of the general taxes of the city of London, is paid directly out of the income of the landed gentry, con&s;tantly or occa&s;ionally re&s;iding there; and it duly corre&s;ponds to the rents of all the hou&s;es they occupy by the year, or for &s;horter terms. And it does not appear, that the clear income of e&s;tates in London in 1623, is taken too low, con&s;ideration being had of this circum&s;tance.</NOTE> leaves the income of both the di&s;tricts 12 millions.</P>
<P N="6">6. The total national income being as &pound;. 43&middot;498 ms. its ab&s;olute amount in 1688; the pre&s;ent amount of the
<PB N="20" REF="150">
general taxes, &pound; 15&middot;162 ms. and the provincial rent as &pound;. 12,000 ms. its ab&s;olute amount at the Revolution; the general taxes upon that income at this time, will, by the a&s;&s;umption, be a fourth proportional to tho&s;e three numbers, or &pound;.4&middot;1827, the &s;um paid thereto, out of the income of e&s;tates real in both di&s;tricts.</P>
<P N="7">7. That paid by each comes next to be determined; and it will be directly proportioned to the income of each re|&s;pectively. Now the incomes of &s;uperior and inferior con|ditions will be mixed, very nearly in the &s;ame proportion in the two di&s;tricts; and the &s;ums of each in each di&s;trict, will be as the &s;elling value of that di&s;trict, whence the &s;um of the rents of both, being taken as 41,814, that of the remote di&s;trict will be as 31,814; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. 1. &sect; 13.</NOTE> and the general taxes of both conjointly, being equal to &pound;.4&middot;1827 ms. by taking a fourth proportional to the&s;e 3 numbers, their charge on the income of the remote di&s;trict is found to be &pound;. 3&middot;1824 ms. and on that of the home di&s;trict at &pound;.1&middot;0003.</P>
<P N="8">8. The la&s;t object of this part of our enquiry is, the total total taxes paid out of the landed income of each di&s;trict, &s;eparately; and the proportion of tho&s;e payments to each other.</P>

<P N="9">9. Now it &s;hall be as &pound;. 1&middot;6525 ms. the total tax upon home di&s;trict, is to 10,000; &s;o is &pound;. 4&middot;2205 ms. the &s;um paid by the proprietors of land in the remote di&s;trict, to 25,540. Therefore the &s;um of the taxes upon the home di&s;trict being taken as 10000, their charge on the remote di&s;trict will be as 25,540; but the rent of the home di&s;trict being taken as 10000, that of the remote divi&s;ion is as 31,814; and the total charge of the taxes paid by the owners of the land of each, ought to be in that propor|tion. Hence the actual taxes on landed income in the
<PB N="21" REF="151">
remote di&s;trict, is to their proportional and equitable amount, as 25,540 to 31,814; or when the &s;um of their payments to the taxes is &pound;. 10,000, their charge ought to be &pound;. 12,436.</P>
<P N="10">10. The total &s;um levied by taxes on the remote di&s;trict, is &pound;. 4&middot;2205 ms. but to render it proportional to the charge on the home di&s;trict, it mu&s;t be increa&s;ed to &pound;. 5&middot;2572 ms. The difference of the&s;e &s;ums, or the defalcation of the land-owners of this divi&s;ion, in their payment of the taxes, is thus found to be &pound;. 1&middot;0367 ms. being that of their pay|ment to the land-tax; which had been before determined to be &pound;. 1&middot;0369 ms. The difference, &pound;. 200, ari&s;es from all places of figures, after the 5th, being entirely neglected in the&s;e operations.</P>
<P N="11">11. The charge in the pound of the land-tax, the gene|ral taxes, and both conjointly, upon the income of land in each of the two di&s;tricts, and their averages on the income of all provincial e&s;tates, are la&s;tly to be determined.</P>
<P N="12">12. The rents of the two di&s;tricts are to be fir&s;t &s;ought. In the year 1774, Mr. Young found the income from the e&s;tates real to amount to &pound;. 24&middot;400 ms. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chalmers, p. 178.</NOTE> From this &s;um, if 2 millions be deducted for the rent of London, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Young, following Mr. King without variation, &s;tates the rent of buildings in the whole kingdom at 2 millions; that of London is taken above at the &s;ame &s;um. It might, upon the fir&s;t in&s;pection, &s;eem to be the con&s;equence of this, that it is &s;uppo&s;ed above, that there were in 1774 no other buildings without a proportional quantity of land annexed to them, than tho&s;e contained in the city of London. But in this account, Mr. Young's object was, to give the total receipt of the landlords annually from their e&s;tates; he has, therefore, in the next article, included in a &s;ingle &s;um with other things, the value of timber &s;old by them; and that being his object, it is rightly included in the total. But timber being a commodity, its value is not a rent of ground on which it grows, any more than the value of a quarter of corn is the rent of the land producing it. Now, &s;uppo&s;ing its annual value in 1688 to have been rightly a&s;&s;igned by Mr. King; and that it had increa&s;ed from that time, until the year 1774, in the &s;ame propor|tion as the rent; it would in the latter year have amounted to &pound;.903,700. The &s;tatement made above, therefore,, tacitly &s;uppo&s;es this &s;um to have been the rent of the remaining buildings of the kingdom, which have no land annexed to them. It may, perhaps, be too &s;mall; but I have cho&s;en, as the probable error in the text is thus very greatly reduced, to adopt no further correction to it.</NOTE> the remainder, &pound;. 22&middot;400 ms. will be the &s;um of the rents in both di&s;tricts in the year 1774; that of 1688 was 12
<PB N="22" REF="152">
millions as above; from both, the income of 1792 is to be determined.</P>
<P N="13">13. Now let the &s;ame a&s;&s;umption be made with regard to the mixed rent, as was before laid down, with re&s;pect to the rents of &s;uperior condition only; that it has increa&s;ed, during the whole of this period, with one con&s;tant degree of celerity; or, which is the &s;ame thing, that it has been every year augmented at an equal rate per cent. The number of years from the Revolution to 1774 was 86; that rate was therefore &pound;. 0&middot;728 per cent.: for the fir&s;t rent, 12 millions, multiplied by 1.0078^8^6, is equal to (1&middot;8666, &times;&pound;. 12,000 ms.) &pound;. 22&middot;400 ms. The period between 1688 and 1792 was 104 years: and by the a&s;&s;umption, the mixed rent at the end of the term was become (&pound;.12&middot;000 ms. &times;1&middot;0078^1^0^4=&pound;.12.0 ms. 2&middot;1271) &pound;.25&middot;525 ms.</P>
<P N="14">14. This being the &s;um of the mixed rents of the two di&s;tricts, that of each is now to be a&s;&s;igned: the rents of the &s;uperior and inferior condition in the two di&s;tricts, are in both very nearly in the &s;ame proportion to each other: hence the &s;um of the&s;e rents, or the mixed income of each di&s;trict (which is the &s;ubject here con&s;idered) will be as the value of that di&s;trict; but the value of both is to the value of the remote di&s;trict, as 41814 to 31814: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. Art. I. &sect; 13.</NOTE> there|fore, as 41,814 is to &pound;. 25&middot;525 ms. the &s;um of the rents of both di&s;tricts, &s;o is 31,814 to &pound;. 19&middot;421 ms. the mixed rent of the greater: that of the home divi&s;ion is therefore &pound;. 6&middot;104 ms.</P>
<P N="15">15. Hence the amount of a tax, or &s;et of taxes, upon either di&s;trict, or both jointly, being given; the proportion of the charge to the rent, or its rate in the pound, may be found. As for example, to find the pre&s;ent rate of the land-tax of the home di&s;trict, it will be, as its annual rent &pound;. 6&middot;104 ms. is to its annual tax, &pound;. 0&middot;6522 ms. &s;o is &pound;. 1 to &pound;. 0&middot;10685, the real rate of the tax in the pound, equal to 25&middot;644 pence, or two &s;hillings and one penny and two-thirds nearly. Again, to find how much in the pound is paid by the landholders of the &s;ame di&s;trict to all the taxes: it will be, as its rent, &pound;. 6&middot;104 ms. is to &pound;. 1.6525 ms. their total payment to the &s;tate; &s;o is &pound;. 1 to &pound;. 0&middot;27072; or &s;hillings 5, 5, nearly. And if from this rate &pound;. 0&middot;27072 be &s;ubtracted &pound;. 0&middot;10685, that of the land-tax as above, the remainder, &pound;. 0&middot;16387, or 3 &s;hillings 3&frac13; pence, is the
<PB N="23" REF="153">
charge in the pound, of the general taxes, upon their in|come; and that of all the upper cla&s;s in &s;ociety. It is thus that the table in the text is formed; exhibiting the rate in the pound of the land-tax, the general taxes, and both conjointly, for the two di&s;tricts.</P>
<P>OBSERVATIONS ON THIS ARTICLE.</P>
<P N="16">16. This fini&s;hes the account of the computations on this branch of the &s;ubject, referred to in the Fourth Section. But if the train of rea&s;oning be carried a little further, the conclu&s;ion we &s;hall come to, will lend no incon&s;iderable evidence to the a&s;&s;umptions which have been made in the cour&s;e of the&s;e operations; it being apparent that the total national income may be deduced from what is laid down in this article. Now the re&s;ult which will be &s;o ob|tained, very nearly coincides with the amount which the general e&s;timation has a&s;&s;igned to that income; but it has not been hitherto calculated upon the&s;e grounds: the evi|denue of the&s;e a&s;&s;umptions is therefore hereby increa&s;ed; there is &s;uperadded to their own internal probability, the whole of that of the generally received e&s;timate of the na|tional income; be&s;ide the pre&s;umption of the truth of both, ari&s;ing from their re&s;ults, being found to be congruous parts of a whole.</P>
<P N="17">17. To determine this income, let us follow an arrange|ment originally adopted by Mr. King; and &s;uppo&s;e the nation to be divided into two cla&s;&s;es, each &s;ubdivi&s;ion of the fir&s;t increa&s;ing its wealth in its re&s;pective proportions; and of the &s;econd, dimini&s;hing it; the expence of the maintenance of each of its &s;ubdivi&s;ions exceeding its income.</P>
<P N="18">18. It has been before ob&s;erved, that the income of the lower cla&s;s exceeds that which would be found from the proportion of their payment to the general taxes; an ob|&s;ervation laid down, as part of the evidence on which the a&s;&s;umption here proceeded upon is founded. And that income mu&s;t be evidently very nearly equal to the &s;um of their wages, and the pre&s;ent amount of the national poor's rate; for mo&s;t of this cla&s;s have no other &s;ub&s;i&s;tence than what they derive from the one or the other.</P>
<P N="19">19. The wages of the labourers in agriculture, was fixed by Mr. Young, in 1774, at &pound;. 14.016 ms. This &s;um has &s;ince been increa&s;ed, and its rate of increa&s;e is to be &s;ought. In the year 1670, the average wages of hu&s;bandmen in all
<PB N="24" REF="154">
England was 8 pence a day: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Petty: Polit. Arithm. p. 124, in Political E&s;&s;ays, or the Briti&s;h Empire. 410. Strahan. 1772.</NOTE> and including extraordinary wages in harve&s;t, turnip-hoeing, and &s;imilar incidents, it is here taken to have been, in the year 1770, 14 pence a day. This charge therefore increa&s;ed at the rate of &pound;. 0.5612 per cent annually, in this interval of 100 years; and in 18 years, elap&s;ed from 1774 to 1792, the wages of the&s;e labourers became increa&s;ed to (1.005618^1^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &times; &pound;. 14.016 ms. &equals;1.0818 &times; &pound;. 14.016 ms.) &pound;. 15.501 ms. upon a &s;uppo|&s;ition that their number continued ab&s;olutely &s;tationary.</P>
<P N="20">20. The wages of the remainder of this cla&s;s is now to be &s;ought. Mr. Sulmioch, a German writer on population, of great celebrity, has determined the average decrements of human life for a whole kingdom, &s;imilar in circum|&s;tances to the Kurmark of Brandenburgh; on a &s;uppo&s;ition, that one third of the inhabitants are re&s;ident in great towns, and the remainder in country pari&s;hes and villages. Now, in all kingdoms, the labouring poor of great towns are as numerous in proportion to the upper cla&s;s, as in the country; but the great towns are generally the &s;eats of manufactures for foreign commerce; and their numbers of every de&s;crip|tion in this kingdom, taken collectively, greatly exceeds that proportion of our total population, which takes place in Brandenburgh. Again, the hu&s;bandman &s;upplies our natural wants only; all our artificial wants are &s;upplied by labouring artizans and manufacturers; and as they much exceed tho&s;e of that part of Germany, the number of per|&s;ons employed in the &s;upply of them here, mu&s;t be a pro|portionably greater part of the people. Hence it is to be concluded, that more than one third part of the labouring cla&s;s are inhabitants of great towns; the average of their wages is al&s;o more than that of labourers in hu&s;bandry; and upon the&s;e two accounts alone, the annual income of the &s;ets of men already enumerated, mu&s;t exceed that of one third of the whole cla&s;s: and if to the expence of their maintenance, we add, that of the labouring manufacturers and arti&s;ans, re&s;iding in villages; of &s;ervants in the coun|try, not employed in hu&s;bandry; of our &s;ailors in the foreign and coa&s;t trades, and in the navy; the &s;oldiers; and the men whom our home fi&s;heries employ; the &s;um of their income by wages, may very well be taken equal to that of the labourers in hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P N="21"><PB N="25" REF="155">21. The amount of the poor's rate remains to be added to this &s;um: it may be &s;aid, that being paid to them from the income of the upper cla&s;s, it is included in it; and thus the &s;ame &s;um will be brought twice to account, in the amount of the national income &s;ought. But all income is rightly brought to the account of that cla&s;s, which ul|timately expends it for its own &s;upport; not of that which pays it to them by law or contract; otherwi&s;e rent would be the income of farmers, not of landlords. Accordingly, in Mr. King's table of national income, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davenant, v. 2. p. 184.</NOTE> the amount of the national poor's rate is taken from the income of the upper, and in&s;erted in that of the inferior cla&s;s; as appears from its con&s;truction. This rate is an increa&s;ing rate; its annual increment in the city of Bri&s;tol, for 20 years, had been found to be &pound;. 4.688 per cent.; in a country di|&s;trict, comprehending many pari&s;hes, &pound;. 3.885 per cent. in two contiguous hundreds, in 7. years, &pound;.4.58 per cent. and in 10 pari&s;hes, in 22 years, &pound;. 2.39 per cent. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations on Mr. Gilbert's bill, 1776, p. 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> Let the average rate of increa&s;e be therefore taken at &pound;. 3 per cent. and in 18 years the charge will be augmented in the proportion of 1.6047 (the amount of one pound at that intere&s;t for that term) to unity. The charge for the maintenance of the poor, for the year ending at Ea&s;ter 1776, was &pound;. 1.5568 ms. and in 10 years, ending at Ea&s;ter 1792, it had thus become increa&s;ed to (&pound;. 1.5568&plus;1.6047) &pound;. 2.4981 ms. Hence the income of the whole cla&s;s is (&pound;. 15.501&times;2, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Annual Regi&s;ter. Dod&s;ley. v. 20, p. 259.</NOTE> &pound;. 2.4981) &pound;. 33.500.</P>
<P N="22">22. That of the upper cla&s;s is now to be found.

At the end of the la&s;t, and the commencement of the pre&s;ent peace, it was generally &s;tated at &pound;. 100 ms. and with this, the amount here found is in perfect coincidence.

<P N="4">4. This would be their payment to the public expences, if their income were taxed only in the &s;ame proportion as that of the re&s;t of the people: but in addition, they pay their &s;hare of the land-tax; and here, by the con&s;tant a&s;|&s;umption, let their pre&s;ent rents be taken as bearing the &s;ame proportion to the whole national rent, which took place in 1688; and it will be as 13 millions, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Whitworth's Davenant, v. z. p. 216.</NOTE> the total rent of e&s;tates real in 1688, is to &pound;. 1&middot;9622 ms. the pre&s;ent amount of the land-tax; &s;o is &pound;. 9&middot;5038 ms. the income of this cla&s;s in 1688, to &pound;. 1&middot;4344, their pre&s;ent payment to that tax; or the exce&s;s of their charge above what is paid out of any other equal income.

The charge on the home di&s;trict is &pound;. 0&middot;10685; and of the other, &pound;. 0&middot;05345: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See comparative Table, Section IV. in the Notes.</NOTE> the augmentation upon them to equalize the tax, will therefore be &pound;.0&middot;0534, or one &s;hilling and &frac45;d. in the pound, amounting to &pound;. 5: 3: 9&frac35; per cent.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE X.</HI> On the Tonnage of the Engli&s;h Ships cleared outward, from the Port of London, the four greater Ports of the Remote Di&s;trict, and the other Ports of the Kingdom.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE computations to be given in this article, require two ob&s;ervations to be placed before them, by way of in|troduction: the fir&s;t is, that although the exi&s;tence of a great decrea&s;e of the &s;hipping of the ports of the home di&s;trict (exclu&s;ive of that of London) be clearly proved by the accounts to be produced, its exact mea&s;ure is not there|by a&s;&s;ignable; and the other, that the fir&s;t application made of them (as I afterwards found) was not the be&s;t ap|proximation to the purpo&s;e in view. The proce&s;s, how|ever, &s;o employed, pre&s;ented &s;ome conclu&s;ions, which &s;eem to have importance enough, to be pre&s;erved in an article of a mi&s;cellaneous Appendix. Here will, therefore, be found other matter, be&s;ide what is referred to as proved, in the body of this tract, or what is nece&s;&s;ary to its &s;upport.</P>
<P N="2">2. In this &s;ubject, it becomes requi&s;ite to con&s;ider the total tonnage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>By the tonnage of a port or ports, is here uniformly meant, tons Engli&s;h, cleared outward in a year, without regard to repeated voyages.</P>
<P>But the number of tons of &s;hipping belonging to any port exceeds the tonnage annually cleared outward; and on an average of the whole kingdom, by one third of the latter amount. (Chalmers, p. 29.) Hence the tons of &s;hipping, and the tonnage cleared outward, are on an average proportional in different years.</P></NOTE> of the kingdom as divided into three parts: the fir&s;t, that of the port of London; the &s;econd, that of the four ports next to it in con&s;equence; or White|haven, Liverpool, Newca&s;tle, and Bri&s;tol, all &s;ituated in the remote di&s;trict; and the third, that of all the remain|ing and &s;maller ports, taken collectively.</P>
<P N="3">3. The amounts of the&s;e three parts of the tonnage, for the years 1750 and 1772, may be determined from two tables given by Mr. Chalmers; whence the increa&s;e or decrea&s;e of any one may be a&s;&s;igned, for a term of time of &s;ufficient duration. In the fir&s;t table, he &s;hews the tonnage of England for 1772, and its average for the years 1749, 1750, 1751; here to be taken as the tonnage
<PB N="30" REF="160">
of 1750. The circum&s;tance which led him to choo&s;e tho&s;e years is evident; but if the average had begun with the year 1750, the compari&s;ons here to be given might have been in&s;tituted upon averages of 3 years for every article; and the matter of the account would have been &s;omewhat more perfect: as it is, we mu&s;t rely on the con&s;equences to be drawn from the entries of 2 &s;ingle years; but from an in&s;pection of his tables, it is evident, that any error to proceed from this circum&s;tance, mu&s;t be very minute. It ought however to be &s;ubjoined to this ob&s;ervation, that it mu&s;t be the fate of writers, who are &s;o much more full of infor|mation than others, as to pre&s;ent us with almo&s;t every thing we can want, that if we mi&s;s a &s;ingle article of it, our di&s;appointment is more marked: it is &s;omewhat like that of the purcha&s;er of a ticket in the lottery, which is either the number immediately above or below a con&s;idera|ble prize.</P>

re&s;pectively, at the beginning and end of the term of 22 years.</P>
<P N="6">6. The two la&s;t columns exhibit, fir&s;t, the proportion in which the tonnage has increa&s;ed in that term, where any &s;uch augmentation took place. And here, that of the year 1750 is con&s;tantly made the &s;tandard of compari&s;on: this is done by taking it as 10000; and finding a fourth number, bearing &s;uch proportion to 10000, as the actual tonnage of 1772 bore to that of 1750; which fourth number will be as the tonnage of 1772. Or it may be conceived another way: if the tonnage of 1750 be &s;uppo&s;ed to be divided into 10000 equal parts, the fourth number, or the proportional, &s;hall be the number of &s;uch parts, of which the tonnage of 1772 con&s;i&s;ted. Let the fir&s;t article in the table, or the total tonnage, be the example of this proce&s;s: then as 609,798 tons, the tonnage of 1750, is to 10000; &s;o is 716,861, the national tonnage in 1772, to 11,755, the fourth proportional. Here the tonnage of 1750 being taken as 10000, that of 1772 will be as 11,755; or if the tonnage of the fir&s;t term be &s;uppo&s;ed to be divided into 10,000 equal parts, that of the &s;econd will con&s;i&s;t of 11,755 &s;uch parts.</P>
<P N="7">7. And in the two la&s;t articles, which relate to the &s;maller ports, fir&s;t, &s;eparately, and &s;econdly, in conjunction with London, where the tonnage is &s;een to have decrea&s;ed in the &s;ame period; that of 1750 again is made the &s;tandard of compari&s;on, to determine its proportional decrea&s;e.</P>
<P>The following ob&s;ervations &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves on this table:</P>
<P N="8">8. Fir&s;tly, The celerity of the increa&s;e of tonnage of the five greater ports conjointly, exceeded that of the kingdom in general, in this period of 22 years; and upon an average, in the proportion of 162 to 118 nearly.</P>
<P N="9">9. Secondly, The proportion of increa&s;e of the tonnage of London exceeded that of the whole kingdom, in the ratio of 136 to 118 nearly. The di&s;proportion of the head to the body of the kingdom is a real evil; and that it is augmenting with the celerity that this proportion implies, is at lea&s;t a drawback from the advantage derived from the increa&s;e of its &s;hipping. Cities may attain &s;uch a degree of population and riches, that the &s;ources of their further augmentation would be attended with much greater advan|tage, if their operation could be transferred to new &s;eats. If that part of its &s;uperabundant waters, which renders
<PB N="32" REF="162">
one place a rank and putrid mar&s;h, &s;hould work its way to &s;ome other where it was wanted, it would diffu&s;e life and fertility over it; and the fir&s;t retain all that luxuriance, and all that luxuriance only, which is whole&s;ome.</P>
<P N="10">10. However it appears, that even in 1772, the propor|tion of the &s;hipping belonging to the port of London, com|pared with that of all England, was not &s;o great as in the beginning of the century; by a &s;urvey taken in 1701, which is pre&s;erved in the Plantation office, we &s;ee that the tonnage of all the trading ve&s;&s;els in England amounted to 261,222, and of the port of London to 84,882 tons; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chalmer's E&s;timate, p. 9.</NOTE> the former of which numbers is to the latter, as 10,000 to 3,249. It therefore had relatively fallen, even in 1772, in the proportion of 3249 to 2772; but in 1750, in the ratio of 3249 to 2397, as will be &s;een in the next table. In which &s;tate, if it had continued, and its re-augmentation pointed out above had been divided among the &s;maller ports of the kingdom, whereby the quantity of our &s;hipping would have remained the &s;ame, it might have been of much greater general advantage.</P>
<P N="11">11. The table here given, &s;hows the proportion of the tonnage of Engli&s;h &s;hips cleared outward, in the kingdom in general, and the port of London, at &s;undry periods, &s;ince the Revolution.</P>

<P N="13">13. I am not without &s;u&s;picion of &s;ome error of the pre&s;s in the authority I follow, in the account of the ton|nage of London for the year 1719.</P>
<P N="14">14. Thirdly, The tonnage of the four great out-ports, had, upon an average, increa&s;ed during 22 years, with a greater celerity than that of London, and in the propor|tion of 181 to 136. And their increa&s;e, &s;imply con&s;idered, exhibits nothing which is not advantageous. It points out the &s;pirit of enterprize to be diffu&s;ed: a great town increa&s;ing rapidly in commerce, is a <HI>punctum vitae</HI> to the whole country round it; and the&s;e advantages continue, until its increa&s;ing opulence begin to have a bad effect on manners, and its increa&s;ing number on population.</P>
<P N="15">15. Fourthly, The tonnage of Whitehaven, which appears, in the table, to have very nearly obtained an equa|lity with that of London, had actually, upon an average of three years, ending with the year 1772, &s;omewhat ex|ceeded it; that of London, for tho&s;e three years, having been 191,069; and of Whitehaven, 194,417 tons. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chalmer's E&s;timate, table, p. 46.</NOTE></P>
<P N="16">16. Fifthly, The proportional increa&s;e of the com|merce of Liverpool, appears to have been &s;omewhat more than double that of the kingdom in general; and to have exceeded that of all other ports.</P>
<P N="17">17. Sixthly, With re&s;pect to &s;hipping, <Q>Bri&s;tol, which is only the fifth, has been hitherto deemed the &s;econd port in relative importance.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chalmers, p. 46.</NOTE></P>
<P N="18"><PB N="34" REF="164">18. Seventhly, Although the port of London is &s;ituated in the home di&s;trict, it is to be con&s;idered as the emporium of the kingdom in general: both are intere&s;ted in what regards the exten&s;ion of its commerce, and nearly perhaps in proportion to the importance of their own fabricks and manufactures; and it cannot be &s;aid to belong exclu&s;ively to either; but con&s;idering the con&s;equences to be drawn from this &s;tatement, it is highly probable that there will not be wanting &s;ome, who paying a greater regard to the geographical &s;ituation of that city, than its relation to the whole kingdom as its capital, will argue for taking the increa&s;e of its &s;hipping to the account of the tonnage of the home di&s;trict. Now, this cannot be &s;eparated from the general total of that of the &s;maller ports: but being joined with them, it appears, that the tonnage of London, and the &s;maller ports, had decrea&s;ed in 22 years, 55.003 tons; and if the tonnage of 1750 be taken as 10000, that of 1772 will be 8659 only. Hence there appears a very con&s;iderable decrea&s;e of tonnage, even in this mode of &s;tating it.</P>
<P N="19">19. Eighthly, The ob&s;ervations on the decrea&s;e of the &s;hipping of the &s;maller ports, the object for which the&s;e inquiries were in&s;tituted, are given in the body of this tract.</P>
<P N="20">20. Ninthly, The proportion of the tonnage of any one or more ports, to that of the kingdom in general, or any other port or ports made the &s;tandard, that is taken as 10000, is the mea&s;ure of the proportion of their &s;hipping nearly, or of their maritime importance: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See note, &sect; 2.</NOTE> and the dif|ference of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, at di&s;tant terms of time, of their relative progre&s;&s;ion or retrogre&s;&s;ion, and both the&s;e points, in every nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tance, may be determined for the years 1750 and 1772. This is done in the divi&s;ions of the following table; the tonnage of the fir&s;t article of each, being made the &s;tandard in both tho&s;e years. Thus, in the fourth divi&s;ion, in the year 1750, the tonnage of the four greater out-ports, 199,538 tons, being made the &s;tandard, or taken as 10000, that of the &s;maller out-ports having been 264,073 tons; the proportion they then bore to the former, will be defined by the fourth proportional to the&s;e three numbers; or be as 13234: but in the year
<PB N="35" REF="165">
1772, that mea&s;ure of their relative importance had become dimini&s;hed to 4327.</P>

<P N="21">21. Tenthly, Again, the different proportions which the tonnage of any port or ports bear to that of any other or others, at any two periods, may become a &s;ubject of inquiry, as was intimated in the account of the con&s;truc|tion of the la&s;t table. Thus the tonnage of the four greater out-ports being taken as 10000, it is &s;een by the la&s;t table, that in 1750 the tonnage of the &s;maller out-ports was as 13234; and in 1772, as 4327. Their relative importance, compared with that of the four greater ports, had there|fore, in twenty-two years, dimini&s;hed in the proportion of tho&s;e numbers: and taking its mea&s;ure in the year 1750, or 13234, as the &s;tandard, or as 10000; in the year 1772, it had become dimini&s;hed in the proportion of 3269 to 10000; or to &s;omething le&s;s than 1-3d of its former mea|&s;ure; for as 13234 is to 10000, &s;o is 4327 to 3269.</P>
<P N="22">22. The variations of the tonnage of the &s;maller out-ports being the principal object of inve&s;tigation in this article, its decrea&s;e, when compared with the total &s;hipping of the kingdom and the greater &s;ubdivi&s;ions, is given in

The &s;um to be borrowed in war, and for which in|tere&s;t is to be paid, was formerly all advanced by individuals; but in future, money is to be borrowed from the appro|priated &s;inking fund; and taxes rai&s;ed to pay the intere&s;t thereof.

<P N="5">5. The average of the&s;e nine years has been &pound;. 70.52 per cent.; of the pre&s;ent I have no account.
<PB N="38" REF="168">
That of the whole term of peace hitherto elap&s;ed, may probably amount to &pound;. 72&frac12;. It has been nece&s;&s;ary for <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ma&s;eres's Annuities, p. 290. Sir John Sinclair's Hi&s;t. p. 3, p. 267.</NOTE> Baron Ma&s;eres and Sir J. Sinclair, in their di&s;qui&s;itions on &s;ome &s;ubjects, collateral to that here treated of, to a&s;&s;ume hypothetically &s;ome rate for the average of this peace; they have concurred in a&s;&s;uming &pound;. 75 per cent. as that rate; in which they are here followed.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the la&s;t peace, the mean price of the &s;ame &s;tock, &s;o taken, was &pound;. 87.05; and in the following war, &pound;. 65.75 per cent. the fir&s;t of which rates is to the &s;econd, as &pound;. 75 to &pound;. 56.64; &s;uppo&s;ing therefore that the proportion of the prices of peace and war will continue the &s;ame, &pound;. 56.64 per cent. will be the average value of the &s;tock next war.</P>
<P N="7">7. The douceur, or premium given for the actual ad|vance of &pound;. 100 to a loan, is the exce&s;s of the market value of all the heterogeneous &s;ecurities granted to the lender, and every other beneficial condition of his contract, which has a value in money, above the &s;um advanced, &pound;. 100. From calculations of all the loans of each, it appears, that the average douceurs of the wars of 1739, 1755, and 1776, were &pound;. 7.789, &pound;. 5.716, and &pound;. 7.947 per cent. re&s;pec|tively; the mean of which is &pound;. 7.150 per cent. It is taken here at 7 per cent.</P>
<P N="8">8. The amount of an adequate fund, to be e&s;tabli&s;hed immediately upon the expiration of the fifth year of a peace, is here &s;ought. This will be applied to the payment of the debt during 5 years; be taken during the next 8 years to the current &s;ervice, the remaining &s;upplies nece&s;|&s;ary for which are to be advanced by loans: and thus, during the war, the debt will increa&s;e; at its termination, the fund is again to be applied to the di&s;charge of the debt for the term of 5 years. In peace, it is annually aug|mented, with the intere&s;t of the capital of the public debt paid off thereby; and in war, by a rate of intere&s;t equal to that effectively made, by tho&s;e who lend money to go|vernment. Now, the amount of the adequate fund is required to be &s;uch, that the capital of the debt, at the beginning and end of the whole term of 18 years, &s;hall be equal.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="39" REF="169">9. The elements for its computation being &s;tated above, according to the&s;e conditions, the amount of the adequate fund will be found to be &pound;. 3.485 ms. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Call the initial amount of the fund F. it will be found by this general form. <GAP DESC="math"></P>

But the price of &s;tock being &pound;. 75 per cent. the capital extingui&s;hed will be one third part, or &pound;. 6.292 ms. more than that amount of the fund, or be equal to &pound;. 25.168 ms. The fund like|wi&s;e will be increa&s;ed during the 5 years of peace, at the rate of &pound;. 4 per cent. yearly. Now, &pound;. 1 &s;o increa&s;ed, amounts at the end of the term to &pound;. 1.2166; the initial fund, &pound;. 3.485 ms. will become &pound;. 4.2399 ms. This &s;um will be advanced by the tru&s;tees of the fund, the fir&s;t year of the war, in part of the extraordinary expences.</P>
<P N="10">10. Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the remainder of the money to be borrowed is funded in the 3 per cent. &s;tocks; and that the douceur for every &pound;. 100 actually advanced, is &pound;. 7; or the public creditors for every &s;uch &s;um advanced, are to be &s;uppo&s;ed to receive a capital in the 3 per cents. who&s;e value is &pound;. 107. The intere&s;t, therefore, made by ad|vancing money to government, will be to that made by the purcha&s;e of &s;tock at the market price, as 107 to 100. The price of the &s;tock in war is taken at &pound;. 56.64 per cent. and the intere&s;t made by &s;uch purcha&s;es, is &pound;. 5.2958 per cent. That made by the advance of money to the loans, is there|fore (&pound;. 5.6665) &pound;. 5&frac23; per cent.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="40" REF="170">11. It is this latter rate of intere&s;t, which is to be al|lowed to the tru&s;tees of the fund for its augmentation, when it is taken to the current &s;ervice in war; and which is to be provided for by new taxes. We mu&s;t enquire now, how much the fund will &s;upply toward the charge of the war, during the whole eight years of its continuance. Now, this &s;um will be equal to the amount of an annuity of &pound;.4.2399 ms. increa&s;ing at the rate of 5&frac23; per cent. during 8 years: the amount of &pound;. 1 for that term, at &pound;. 5 per cent. is &pound;. 9.5491; at &pound;. 6 per cent. &pound;. 9.8974; and at &pound;. 5&frac23; per cent. &pound;. 9.7813 very nearly. Hence the total of the &s;ums advanced by the tru&s;tees in eight years, will be (9.7813 &times; &pound;. 4.2392 ms.) &pound;. 41.471 ms.</P>
<P N="12">12. The whole of the extraordinary charge of the war is taken at &pound;. 80 ms. and the advances of the common creditors mu&s;t therefore be &pound;. 38.528 ms. for every &pound;.100 of which &s;um, they will obtain a new capital in the 3 per cents, who&s;e value is &pound;. 107. The &s;elling price of the whole of the new capital will therefore be &pound;. 41.224 ms. and the &s;tock being &pound;. 56.64 per cent, the whole of the new capi|tal will amount to &pound;. 72.771.</P>
<P N="13">13. We are now to enquire how much 3 per cent. capital will be paid off by the fund, in the fir&s;t five years of peace; its amount for the fir&s;t year mu&s;t be therefore determined. &pound;. 1 annually increa&s;ing at the rate of 5&frac23; per cent. will, at the end of 8 years, become &pound;. 1.5550 very nearly; for increa&s;ing at &pound;. 5 per cent. it would have become &pound;. 1.4774; and at &pound;. 6, it would have increa&s;ed to &pound;. 1.5938. Hence &pound;. 4.2399 ms. the fund at the beginning of the war, will, at the termination thereof, be augmented to (1.5550 &times; &pound;. 4.2399 ms.) The intere&s;t and price of &s;tock in the fir&s;t 5 years, or half term of this peace, are taken at the &s;ame rates as in the latter 5 years of the preceding; or at &pound;. 4, and &pound;. 75 per cent. re&s;pectively: and proceeding as before, it will be found, that the fund will produce in money, in 5 years, (5.4163 &times; &pound;. 6.593 ms.) &pound;. 35.710 ms. which &s;um (the 3 per cents being at &pound;. 73) will di&s;charge a capital (&pound;. 35.710 ms. &plus; &pound;. 11 903 ms.) &pound;. 47.613 ms. and the capital di&s;charged by the operation of the fund in the for|mer peace, was &s;hewn to be &pound;. 25.168 ms. and in both conjointly, &pound;. 72.781 ms. the new capital generated by the intervening war.</P>

<P>SINCE this Tract has been printed off, a new edition of Mr. Chalmers's e&s;timate (&s;o often quoted in it) has been put into my hands. In this, the table of the yearly tonnage of the five greater ports is omitted&mdash;the foundation of every thing laid down above, concerning the &s;hipping of the ports of the home counties. This omi&s;&s;ion is of too much con&s;equence to be pa&s;&s;ed over without &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon it.</P>
<P>Although the matter of the table be in it&s;elf very curious, it appears to have been in&s;erted in the original edition prin|cipally on account of two inferences there drawn from it. The&s;e appear to me to have been afterwards di&s;covered by this candid Writer, not to be legitimately founded thereon; and it was (as I &s;uppo&s;e) omitted in the edition of 1786, as no longer lending &s;upport to any thing there advanced, and con&s;equently become &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>In the ob&s;ervations which introduce it, he &s;tates the <Q>five principal ports as repre&s;entatives of the whole;" and as demon&s;trating the great progre&s;s of our navigation in twenty years:</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edition of 1782, Table, p. 47.</NOTE> hence it is evident that he &s;uppo&s;ed the tonnage of the &s;maller ports had increa&s;ed, in &s;ome proportion, not very di&s;&s;imilar to that of the greater. In &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the table, together with his remarks upon it, he has tacitly given up this induction. It has been &s;hewn
<PB N="42" REF="172">
above (and from this <Q>Extract from the Regi&s;ter of Ship|ping,</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edition of 1782, Table, p. 47.</NOTE> joined with others contained in the &s;ame work), that while the tonnage of the&s;e ports increa&s;ed with an a&s;&s;igned celerity, that of the &s;maller had decrea&s;ed with much more.</P>
<P>His &s;econd greater inference from the table is of an im|portance, on this &s;ubject, which demands a fuller con|&s;ideration of it. From the equality of the tonnage cleared outward in 1772, he lays it down, that in that year <Q>Whitehaven claimed an equality with London, in re|&s;pect to the numbers of native &s;hipping.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edition of 1782, Table, p. 47.</NOTE> This de|duction, which is likewi&s;e erroneous, he appears de&s;irous of di&s;avowing more explicitly in the Preface to his im|proved edition of 1786; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Edition of 1786, Preface, p. 9.</NOTE> by &s;tating, that the colliers of Whitehaven and Newca&s;tle enter and clear at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e &s;everal times in one year. Hence, from a given increa&s;e of tonnage annually cleared outward from one of the&s;e ports, the &s;ame increa&s;e of its &s;hipping is not to be inferred, as from an equal augmentation of that of the other ports of the kingdom, taken on the average.</P>
<P>Now many of the con&s;iderations on the decrea&s;e of the &s;hipping of the home di&s;trict given above, admit the a&s;&s;ump|tion which Mr. Chalmers &s;eems to have rightly now guard|ed again&s;t, by a prote&s;t in form; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive the error it may lead to on this &s;ubject as of no con&s;equence. It is evidently of that magnitude, that it may either greatly exaggerate the appearance of the growing depre&s;&s;ion of the &s;hipping of the &s;maller ports, or operate &s;o on the re&s;ult, as to conceal a very great part of its true amount.</P>
<P>It &s;hall therefore be here &s;hewn, that the latter has been the ca&s;e; and that if any allowance be made to counter-balance the effect of this erroneous principle in the pre|ceding computations, what has been laid down on this &s;ubject in the fourth &s;ection will hold good <HI>&agrave; fortieri.</HI></P>
<P>This is proved as follows: Whitehaven and Newca&s;tle being excluded, the proportion of the whole tonnage of the greater ports annually cleared outward, to the &s;hipping they po&s;&s;e&s;s, may be taken to be very nearly the &s;ame as that of the &s;maller ports; but the annual tonnage of tho&s;e two ports bears a greater proportion to the quantity of their
<PB N="43" REF="173">
&s;hipping. Now here let there be a&s;&s;umed, as &s;ucce&s;&s;ive hypothe&s;es, that the voyages made by the &s;hipping of tho&s;e two ports, are to tho&s;e made by that of the other ports of the kingdom in equal terms of time, fir&s;t, in the ratio of equality; &s;econdly, in that of two to one; and la&s;tly, in that of three to one: it follows, that the quantity of &s;hip|ping in the re&s;t of the kingdom, being as the tonnage cleared therefrom annually, that of the two ports &s;hall be, on the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition, as their annual tonnage; on the &s;econd, as one half thereof; and on the third, as one third part thereof.</P>

<P>The difference of the latter numbers, 5,082 tons, may very well be taken as accidental: hence it follows (the two coal ports being &s;et out of the great que&s;tion), that if the remaining ports of the kingdom be taken, as divided into two &s;ets, the fir&s;t increa&s;ing in &s;hipping, and the &s;e|cond decrea&s;ing, the gain of the one has, in this term of twenty-two years, been equal to the lo&s;s of the other.</P>
<P>According to the fir&s;t hypothe&s;is, the &s;hipping of White|haven and Newca&s;tle, in the years 1750 and 1772, are to be taken as 141,894, and 254,039 re&s;pectively; accord|ing to the &s;econd, as one half thereof, or 70,947, and 127,019; and according to the third, as one third thereof, or 47,298, and 84,679; to render the total national ton|nage, and its principal divi&s;ions, proportional to the total &s;hipping, and its corre&s;ponding divi&s;ions re&s;pectively, ac|cording to the condition of each hypothe&s;is.</P>

of the increa&s;e of our commercial &s;hipping and naval force, generated by the increa&s;e of the trade of the five great ports, has been annihilated by the decline of the trade of the &s;maller, taken conjointly: wherefore, if they had been able only to retain the trade they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at the beginning of the term, the augmentation of our &s;hipping for trade and war (con&s;iderable as it was), would have been more

in the above term of twenty-two years.</P>
<P>Hence the increa&s;e of the national &s;hipping, and its naval force, appears to have been much more retarded by the decline of the &s;maller ports upon the &s;econd and third hypothe&s;es, than on the fir&s;t; that is, than on the &s;tate|ment of the &s;ame matter, given in the third paragraph of the 76th page of this tract. As, therefore, &s;ome allowance mu&s;t be made for the repeated voyages of the colliers of the two ports, the bad con&s;equences of that decline are there &s;tated at le&s;s than their true magnitude.</P>
<P>Its celerity was likewi&s;e &s;uch, that the tonnage of the &s;maller ports was, in twenty-two years, reduced in the proportion of 10,000 to 5,926: an unparalleled and afflict|ing contra&s;t to the pro&s;perity of the four great out-ports; the annual tonnage of which increa&s;ed in the &s;ame time, in the proportion of

<P>Here again, the fir&s;t hypothe&s;is is that on which the ce|lerity of the decrea&s;e of the former, and the increa&s;e of the latter, is given, p. 77, l. 13, &amp;c. and its re&s;ult is con|firmed by that of the two la&s;t hypothe&s;es, <HI>&agrave; fortiori.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;hipping of the greater ports of the remote di&s;trict having increa&s;ed in the above proportion, it may with great moderation be a&s;&s;umed, that the &s;mall ports of that di&s;trict, by &s;ituation partaking of the &s;ame common ad|vantages, have, in the &s;ame time, increa&s;ed in the pro|portion of

<P>Thus it is evident, in the three la&s;t comparative &s;tate|ments, that every thing on the decline of the &s;maller ports, deduced from the fir&s;t hypothe&s;is, follows, <HI>&agrave; for|tiori,</HI>

Thus the proportion of the &s;hipping of the &s;maller ports, to that of the whole kingdom, appears, upon the fir&s;t, to have de|crea&s;ed in twenty-two years in the ratio of 5,040 to 10,000; and by the third, in that of 5,576 to the &s;ame number, which is its greate&s;t difference. Here, although their re|lative decline appears, by the &s;econd e&s;timate, &s;omewhat le&s;s than before, that difference of the&s;e re&s;ults is not enough to have any weight again&s;t any general conclu&s;ion which might have been drawn from the fir&s;t: but in the Fourth Section, no argument has been brought forward from the decrea&s;e of the tonnage, con&s;idered in this point of view.</P>
<P>As by the two la&s;t hypothe&s;es, the total annual tonnage of the kingdom is dimini&s;hed, that of London remaining the &s;ame as before in every period; hence it follows, that what is &s;aid of the great proportion of the national com|merce concentrated in that va&s;t city, holds good, <HI>&agrave; for|tiori.</HI> If it had been judged nece&s;&s;ary, the table in which it is particularly given might have been extended to com|prehend the re&s;ults of the two la&s;t hypothe&s;es, and enlarged from the later collections of Mr. Chalmers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;timate, Edition of 1786, p. 61.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="179">THERE are &s;ome further Variations in the edition of Mr. Chalmers's E&s;timate of 1786, from that of 1782, which mu&s;t be likewi&s;e here noticed.</P>
<P>In the 178th page of the fir&s;t edition, Mr. Chalmers has given a Table of the annual produce of the land of England, and the annual expence of it to the farmer. It is copied from Young's Political Arithmetic, part II. page 32. This Table likewi&s;e is not reprinted in the &s;ub&s;equent publica|tion of his E&s;timate in 1786. The edition I po&s;&s;e&s;s of this work of Mr. Young, has no &s;econd part; nor have I been able to find one in which it is contained; but from the corre&s;pondence of the general totals to the articles of which they are compounded, it is evident that the whole was accurately copied in the fir&s;t publication of Mr. Chal|mers. From a compari&s;on of Mr. Young's Northern and Ea&s;tern Tour, I have verified the fir&s;t article of the far|mer's expenditure, the rent of the land of England, and the &s;um of the three following&mdash;the tithes, poor's rate, and pari&s;h charges: the amount of the two la&s;t articles, the annual expence of &s;eed-grain and labour, as deduced, in the &s;ame mode, from the&s;e Tours,&mdash;are &s;ufficiently near to tho&s;e in this account, for the purpo&s;es for which I have quoted it. Even if the difference of the&s;e articles be an error in the latter, which however ought to be under&s;tood as a correction of the average of the Tours, made upon rea&s;on by Mr. Young, the&s;e &s;everal amounts are deter|mined from the minutes he took in his journeys; and there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e them not to be as accurate as tho&s;e he collected at the &s;ame time, to determine the num|ber of per&s;ons engaged in farming. The&s;e Mr. Chalmers, in the improved edition of his E&s;timate, &s;tates to have been of &s;ufficient accuracy for that purpo&s;e. It may be &s;uppo&s;ed, therefore, that although he did not find it nece&s;&s;ary to the improved and abridged plan of his work, to retain the Table, he notwith&s;tanding had not changed his former opinion of the &s;everal articles thereof, that they <Q>were &s;atisfactory, becau&s;e the data were good.</Q> This Table is quoted in the 5th, 8th, 21&s;t, and 28th pages of the Appendix of this Tract.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="180">IN his fir&s;t Edition, Mr. Chalmers had &s;tated the va|lue of land in 1729, at twenty-five and twenty-&s;ix years purcha&s;e: in &s;upport of which he quotes Ander&s;on's Hi&s;tory of Commerce, Vol. II. p. 322. In the edition of that Work printed in 1787 (Vol. III. p. 156) it is &s;aid, that land then &s;old at twenty-five, twenty-&s;ix, and twenty-&s;even years purcha&s;e: but the two fir&s;t of the&s;e are to be e&s;teemed as the ordinary rates, and the la&s;t as the highe&s;t price of land at that time; and its average value may, in all contracts, very well be taken to have been, at that time, twenty-five and a half years purcha&s;e, as &s;tated in the fir&s;t &s;ection of this E&s;&s;ay, p. 18. If we compare Mr. Chalmers's extract from Ander&s;on, in p. 138 of the edition of 1782, with the corre&s;ponding pa&s;&s;ages of that of 1786 (p. 98 and 167), the nece&s;&s;ity of this ob&s;ervation will be evident.</P>
<P>I have followed the fir&s;t copy of the E&s;timate in this Pamphlet, in other places be&s;ides tho&s;e already noticed; but the pa&s;&s;ages I have made u&s;e of are repeated in the im|proved edition of his work, printed in 1786.</P>
