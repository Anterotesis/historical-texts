<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON FOREST SCENERY. BOOK III.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>WE concluded the la&s;t book with a catalogue (for it was little more) of the principal fore&s;ts, which for|merly over&s;pread the i&s;land of Britain. None of them at this day po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it's original grandeur. A few have pre&s;erved &s;ome little appearance of &s;cenery: but the greater part are wa&s;tes. New-fore&s;t in Hamp|&s;hire is among the few, which have retained any ideas of their ancient con&s;equence.&mdash; At lea&s;t it is &s;uperior to the re&s;t, on account of the extent of it's boundaries; the variety of it's contents; and the grandeur of it's &s;cenes.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7">With the&s;e &s;cenes I propo&s;e, in the fol|lowing book, to illu&s;trate the ob&s;ervations, which have been made in the two preceding books; and &s;hall in &s;everal excur&s;ions, through the different parts of this woody country, endeavour to point out it's peculiar beauties. But tho I &s;hall chiefly con&s;ider it in a <HI>pic|ture&s;que light,</HI> I &s;hall vary my &s;ubject by giving a general idea of the ancient hi&s;|tory, and pre&s;ent &s;tate, of this celebrated fore&s;t.</P>
<P>This tract of wood-land was originally made a fore&s;t by William I in the year 1079. about thirteen years after the battle of Ha&s;tings; and is indeed the only fore&s;t in England, who&s;e origin can be traced. It took the denomination of New-fore&s;t from it's being an addition to the many fore&s;ts, which the crown already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and which had formerly been appropriated in feudal times. The original name of this tract of country was Ytene.</P>
<P>As &s;everal fore&s;ts were more commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated for royal diver&s;ion than New-fore&s;t, the hi&s;torian hath been &s;ometimes led to
<PB N="3" REF="8">
conceive, that William mu&s;t have had other ends, than amu&s;ement, in making this ad|dition to them: and ob&s;erving farther, it's vicinity to the coa&s;t of Normandy, he hath from this circum&s;tance drawn a &s;urmi&s;e, that under the idea of a fore&s;t, William meant to pre&s;erve an unob&s;erved communication with the continent; which would enable him to embark his troops, on either &s;ide, without giving alarm.</P>
<P>But this &s;urmi&s;e depends on no hi&s;torical evidence; neither indeed is it probable. The coa&s;ts of Kent, and Su&s;&s;ex were more com|modious for the embarkation of troops, than any part of New-fore&s;t. And it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e an army could be embarked any where without ob&s;ervation. Southampton in|deed was commodious enough: but this port neither lies in New-fore&s;t; nor does the fore&s;t in any degree, &s;kreen it's avenues.&mdash;Be&s;ides, the affairs of William were never in &s;o per|plexed a &s;ituation, as to require privacy; e&s;pecially at the time when he made this fore&s;t; which was after he had defeated all his enemies, and was of cour&s;e in the height of his power.&mdash;Nor indeed was it agreeable to the general character of this prince to do
<PB N="4" REF="9">
things &s;ecretly. He rather cho&s;e, on all occa&s;ions, to &s;way the &s;ceptre with a lofty hand.&mdash;The judicious Rapin &s;eems to clo&s;e the whole debate very ju&s;tly, by ob&s;erving, that this &s;urmi&s;e &s;eems to have ari&s;en merely from an opinion, that &s;o politic a prince as William, could do nothing without a political end: whereas the mo&s;t politic princes, no doubt, are &s;wayed where their plea&s;ures are concerned, by pa&s;&s;ions, and caprice, like other men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. fol. page 178.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The means, which William u&s;ed in af|fore&s;ting the&s;e exten&s;ive wood-lands, create another que&s;tion among hi&s;torians. The ge|neral opinion is, that he de&s;troyed a number of villages, and churches; drove out the in|habitants; laid their lands wa&s;te; and formed New-fore&s;t in their room.</P>
<P>This opinion has appeared to &s;ome ill &s;ounded; and Voltaire in particular, has &s;tood up in defence of the humanity, or rather the policy of William. It is ab&s;urd, he thinks, to &s;uppo&s;e that a prince &s;o noted for prudent and intere&s;ted conduct, &s;hould
<PB N="5" REF="10">
lay wa&s;te &s;o much cultivated ground; plant it with fore&s;t trees, which would be many years in coming to perfection; and for the &s;ake of a few deer, turn adrift &s;o large a body of his indu&s;trious &s;ubjects, who might have contributed &s;o much to the increa&s;e of his revenues<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his abridgment of univer&s;al hi&s;tory.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Voltaire's conclu&s;ion may be ju&s;t; but his rea&s;oning is certainly ill-founded. It proceeds on the <HI>improbability</HI> of &s;o wide a de&s;olation; whereas it might have proceeded better on the <HI>impo&s;&s;ibility</HI> of it. For how could William have &s;pread &s;uch depopulation in a country, which, from the nature of it, mu&s;t have been from the fir&s;t very thinly inhabited? The ancient Ytene was undoubtedly a woody tract long before the times of William. Voltaire's idea therefore of <HI>planting a fore&s;t</HI> is ab&s;urd, and is founded on a total ignorance of the country. He took his ideas merely from a French fore&s;t, which is artificially planted, and laid out in vi&s;tas, and alleys. It is probable, that William rather opened his cha&s;es by cutting down wood; than that
<PB N="6" REF="11">
he had occa&s;ion to plant more.&mdash;Be&s;ides, tho the internal &s;trata of the &s;oil of New-fore&s;t are admirably adapted to produce timber; yet the &s;urface of it, is in general, poor; and could never have admitted, even if the times had allowed, any high degree of cul|tivation. &mdash;Upon the whole therefore, it does not &s;eem <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> that William could have &s;pread &s;o wide a depopulation through this country, as he is repre&s;ented to have done.</P>
<P>On the other hand, there is no contending again&s;t the &s;tream of hi&s;tory: and tho we may allow that William could not make any great depopulation; we are not to &s;uppo&s;e he made none at all. Many writers, who lived about his time, unite in lamentable complaints of his deva&s;tations. According to them, at lea&s;t thirty miles of cultivated lands were laid wa&s;te; above fifty pari&s;h churches, and many villages de&s;troyed; and all the inhabitants extirpated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In &s;ylva, quae vocatur nova fore&s;ta, eccle&s;ias, et villas eradicari; gentem extirpari; et a feris fecit inhabitari.

Knighton.</P></NOTE>. But it is to be con&s;idered, that
<PB N="7" REF="12">
the&s;e writers were monks, who had taken high offence at William for his exactions on their mona&s;teries; and were neither, as it appears, informed them&s;elves; nor di&s;po&s;ed through their prejudices, to inform others. Many things they &s;ay, are palpably fal&s;e.</P>
<P>In this dearth therefore of hi&s;torical evidence, we are &s;till at a lo&s;s To &s;uppo&s;e that William made no deva&s;tation, and to &s;uppo&s;e that he made all, which the&s;e prejudiced
<PB N="8" REF="13">
monks lay to his charge, &s;eem to be &s;up|po&s;itions equally un&s;upported. On the whole therefore, the truth of this matter, as of mo&s;t others, lies probably between the two opi|nions.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;ituation, and boundaries of this exten&s;ive fore&s;t, it occupies the &s;outh|we&s;t extremity of Hamp&s;hire; and in it's earlier form was a kind of penin&s;ula, bounded by the bay of Southampton on the ea&s;t&mdash; by the river Avon on the we&s;t&mdash;and on the &s;outh; by the channel of the i&s;le of Wight, as far as the Needles; and to the we&s;t of tho&s;e rocks by the ocean. Thus the boundaries of New-fore&s;t were determined by the natural lines of the country.</P>
<P>It does not however appear, that William I extended the bounds of New-fore&s;t thus far. They are &s;uppo&s;ed rather to have been inlarged by &s;ucceeding princes; particularly by Henry I, who was probably tempted by the natural limits of the country. By this prince, or at lea&s;t by &s;ome of the early &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors of William, the whole penin&s;ula was taken in; and the bounds of the fore&s;t were
<PB N="9" REF="14">
fairly extended, as I have de&s;cribed them, to the bay of Southampton, the river Avon, and the &s;ea.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e days it was a matter of little ceremony either to make, or to inlarge a fore&s;t. Thus &s;aith the law: "It is allowed to our &s;overeign lord the king, in re&s;pect of his continual care, and labour, for the pre|&s;ervation of the whole realm, among other privileges, this prerogative, to have his places of recreation, and pa&s;time, where&s;oever he will appoint. For as it is at the liberty, and plea&s;ure of his grace to re&s;erve the wild bea&s;ts, and the game to him&s;elf, for his only delight and plea&s;ure, &s;o he may al&s;o at his will and plea&s;ure, make a fore&s;t for them to abide in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Manwood on fore&s;t-law, chap. ii.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Agreeable to this &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, the royal fore&s;ts were regulated. Each had it's laws, and government; and as the&s;e differed from each other in very few particulars, all were equally grievous to the &s;ubject. Fore&s;t-law indeed was one of the greate&s;t incroach|ments that ever was made upon the natural
<PB N="10" REF="15">
rights of mankind; and con&s;idering the di&s;|parity of the object, one of the greate&s;t in&s;ults of tyranny.</P>
<P>The Romans had no idea of appropriating game. Under their government the fore&s;ts of England, like tho&s;e of America, were common hunting-grounds. The northern barbarians fir&s;t pretended to the right of making private pro|perty of what, being naturally wild, belonged equally to all.</P>
<P>The idea of fore&s;t-law, and fore&s;t-rights obtained early indeed in Saxon times. But the Saxon princes were in general a mild race; and there were &s;ome traces of liberal &s;entiment in their in&s;titutions. Under them, untenanted wa&s;tes only were affore&s;ted&mdash;the penalties of fore&s;t-laws were gentle&mdash;and the execution of them never rigid. So that, in tho&s;e equitable times, fore&s;t-law was hardly e&s;teemed a burthen upon the people.</P>
<P>The Norman princes were a different race. They were fierce, haughty, violent, and de|&s;potic. Under them the language of Engli&s;h law in general a&s;&s;umed a new tone; and of fore&s;t-law in particular. For as the Norman princes were all mighty hunters, this part of juri&s;prudence engaged their peculiar attention.
<PB N="11" REF="16">
It was conceived in the highe&s;t &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m; and executed with the utmo&s;t rigour of vindictive tyranny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>If the reader wi&s;h to &s;ee the mi&s;chiefs of fore&s;t-law heightened by poetic images, the following lines of Mr. Pope &s;et them in a &s;trong light.</P>

<P><PB N="12" REF="17">It is true indeed the principal object of fore&s;t-law was the pre&s;ervation of game, which the offender killed at his own peril. But when we recollect how exten&s;ive the royal fore&s;ts were, including little le&s;s than an eighth part of the kingdom&mdash;when we con|&s;ider the mi&s;chievous nature of every &s;pecies of game, and particularly of fore&s;t-deer in cultivated lands&mdash;when we ob&s;erve farther, that many of the royal fore&s;ts were blended
<PB N="13" REF="18">
with private property&mdash;that the limits of others were very undefined&mdash;and la&s;tly, when we reflect, how ea&s;y a matter it was, by a &s;tretch of royal authority, to fix the locality of a tre&s;pa&s;s in a fore&s;t, tho it was never committed there; we may ea&s;ily conclude, from the whole, how fertile a &s;ource of vexation fore&s;t-law might be made, tho it merely re&s;pected game.</P>
<P>But other grievances accrued. Many in|croachments were made on private property. Extravagant claims were pretended by fore&s;t-officers; and heavy tolls were levied on &s;uch merchandize, as pa&s;&s;ed through the king's fore&s;ts, tho in fact, it could pa&s;s in no other direction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See King John's charter of fore&s;ts.</NOTE>. Sometimes al&s;o needy prin|ces, (and mo&s;t of them were needy) with a view to rai&s;e money, would &s;end commi&s;&s;ioners purpo&s;ely to examine into fore&s;t-tre&s;pa&s;&s;es; and on the&s;e occa&s;ions, we may be &s;ure, there was always exaggeration enough.</P>
<P>This accumulation of hard&s;hip was at all times deeply felt, and re&s;ented; and whenever the reins of government &s;lackened in the hands of a weak prince, the &s;pirit of the nation aro&s;e,
<PB N="14" REF="19">
and endeavoured to re&s;ume its native rights. Succe&s;s at la&s;t attended the&s;e repeated &s;truggles. Fore&s;t-law was aboli&s;hed; at lea&s;t its mi&s;chie|vous effects were repre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>But if the people imagined this victory would rein&s;tate them in their native rights over the fore&s;t, they were mi&s;taken. A new &s;pecies of law, under the denomination of <HI>game-law,</HI> aro&s;e upon the ruins of <HI>fore&s;t-law.</HI> This law had from it's in&s;titution an ari&s;|tocratic ca&s;t. For the barons and great men, who had wre&s;ted the rigour of fore&s;t-law from the prince, did not mean to free the people from the impo&s;ition; but only to admini&s;ter it them&s;elves: and thus a thou&s;and tyrants &s;tarted up in&s;tead of one. Some of the &s;everer penalties indeed were aboli&s;hed. A man pre|&s;erved his eyes, or his hands, tho he killed a phea&s;ant, or a partridge: but he was fined&mdash; he was impri&s;oned&mdash;his dog was &s;hot&mdash;his arms were taken from him&mdash;and he was conti|nually tea&s;ed with vexatious &s;uits. Be&s;ides, as game-law was more exten&s;ive than fore&s;t-law, it involved greater numbers within it's influence.</P>

<P>THE government of New-fore&s;t is, at this time, nearly what it originally was, excepting only that the abolition of fore&s;t-law hath re&s;trained the power of it's officers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I had many particulars with regard to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of New-fore&s;t from Mr. Samber of ca&s;tle-Malwood lodge, who was intimately acquainted with it.

<P>The chief officer belonging to it, is the lord-warden, who is generally &s;ome per&s;on of great di&s;tinction. The pre&s;ent lord-warden is the duke of Gloce&s;ter.&mdash;Under him are two di&s;tinct appointments of officers; the one to pre&s;erve the <HI>veni&s;on</HI> of the fore&s;t; and the
<PB N="18" REF="23">
other to pre&s;erve it's <HI>vert.</HI> The <HI>former</HI> term, in the language of fore&s;t-law, includes all &s;pecies of game: the <HI>latter</HI> re&s;pects the woods, and lawns, which harbour, and feed them.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e officers who &s;uperintend the game, are fir&s;t the two <HI>rangers.</HI> But the office of <HI>ranger;</HI> as well as that of <HI>bow-bearer,</HI> and a few others, have been long in di&s;u&s;e: at lea&s;t they &s;eem to be delegated to the keepers: of the&s;e there are fifteen; who pre&s;ide over as many <HI>walks,</HI> into which the fore&s;t is divided. In each walk is erected a lodge. A few of the&s;e lodges are elegant man&s;ions; and are the habitations of the keepers, who are generally men of fa&s;hion, or fortune. Prince William of Gloce&s;ter has one; the duke of Bolton another; and lord Delawar a third; but in general, the lodges are but moderate buildings; and are inhabited by the under-keepers, or <HI>groom-keepers,</HI> as they are called; on whom the executive part of the keeper's office devolves.</P>
<P>The under-keeper feeds the deer in winter&mdash; browzes them in &s;ummer&mdash;knows where to find a fat buck&mdash;executes the king's warrants for veni&s;on&mdash;pre&s;ents offences in the fore&s;t-courts&mdash; and prevents the de&s;truction of game.

It implies the &s;everal circum&s;tances, in which offenders may be taken <HI>with the manner,</HI> as it is phra&s;ed.

<P>With regard to the woods of the fore&s;t, which were originally con&s;idered only as they re&s;pected game, the fir&s;t officer, under the
<PB N="20" REF="25">
lord-warden, is the woodward. It is his bu&s;ine&s;s, as his title denotes, to in&s;pect the woods. He prevents wa&s;te&mdash;he &s;ees that young trees are properly fenced&mdash;and he a&s;&s;igns timber for the payment of fore&s;t-officers. This timber is &s;old by auction at the court at Lyndhur&s;t; and annually amounts to about &s;even hundred pounds; which is the &s;um required.</P>
<P>Under the <HI>woodward</HI> are twelve <HI>regarders;</HI> and to the&s;e indeed chiefly is delegated the executive part of his office. The regarders &s;eize the hedge-bills, and axes of tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers; pre&s;ent offences in the fore&s;t-courts; and a&s;&s;ign &s;uch timber as is claimed by the inhabitants, and borderers of the fore&s;t, for fuel, and repairs. Of this inferior wood, there are great quantities a&s;&s;igned, on every &s;ide of the fore&s;t. I can only &s;peak of my own a&s;&s;ign|ment, as vicar of Boldre; which is annually twelve load.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e officers, who are in effect the officers of the crown, as they are appointed by the lord-warden; there are four others, called <HI>verderors,</HI> who are commonly gentlemen of property and intere&s;t in the neighbourhood, and are elected, like the knights of the &s;hire, by
<PB N="21" REF="26">
the freeholders of the county. The&s;e officers, &s;ince the <HI>ju&s;ticiary-in-eyre</HI> has been a &s;inecure, are the only judges of the fore&s;t-courts. The verderor is an ancient fore&s;t-officer. His name occurs in the earlie&s;t account of fore&s;t-law. But tho his appointment has at pre&s;ent a democratical ca&s;t, it is probable, that he was formerly a royal officer; and that his election by the free-holders of the county was extorted from the crown in &s;ome period favourable to liberty. As New-fore&s;t was always con&s;idered as the great magazine of navy timber, the verderors were impowered by an act of par|liament in king William's time, to fine delinquents to the amount of five pounds in their attachment-courts: whereas in all the other fore&s;ts of England, the fine does not amount to more than a few pence, which was the original amer&s;ement. The <HI>ver|deror</HI> is an officer without &s;alary: but by ancient cu&s;tom he was entitled to cour&s;e, and take what deer he plea&s;ed, in his way to the fore&s;t-court: but this privilege is now com|pounded by an annual fee of a buck, and a doe.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e ancient officers of the fore&s;t, there is one of later in&s;titution, &s;ince timber became valuable as a material. He is called
<PB N="22" REF="27">
the <HI>purveyor,</HI> and is appointed by the com|mi&s;&s;ioner of the dock at Port&s;mouth. His bu&s;ine&s;s is to a&s;&s;ign timber for the u&s;e of the navy. The origin of the purveyor is not earlier than the reign of Charles II. in who&s;e time five hundred oaks, and fifty beeches were annually a&s;&s;igned for the king's yards; and this officer was appointed to a&s;&s;ign them. But it being found, that the fore&s;t could ill &s;upply &s;o large a quantity of oak; in&s;tead of five hundred, the number was afterwards reduced to &s;ixty; which together with fifty beeches, are &s;till annually a&s;&s;igned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Samber's MS.</NOTE>. The purveyor has a &s;alary of fifty pounds a year; and &s;ix and eight-pence a day, when on duty.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this account of the officers of the fore&s;t with the &s;ingular character of one of them, who lived in the times of James, and Charles I. It is pre&s;erved in Hutchin's hi&s;tory of Dor&s;et&s;hire<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See vol. ii. p. 63.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The name of this memorable &s;port&s;man, for in that character alone he was con&s;picuous, was Henry Ha&s;tings. He was &s;econd &s;on to the earl of Huntingdon; and inherited a good
<PB N="23" REF="28">
e&s;tate in Dor&s;et&s;hire from his mother. He was one of the keepers of New-fore&s;t; and re&s;ided in his lodge there, during a part of every hunting-&s;ea&s;on. But his principal re&s;i|dence was at Woodlands, in Dor&s;et&s;hire, where he had a capital man&s;ion. One of his neare&s;t neighbours, was the lord chancellor Cooper, fir&s;t earl of Shaft&s;bury. Two men could not be more oppo&s;ite in their di&s;po&s;itions, and pur&s;uits. They had little communication therefore; and their occa&s;ional meetings were rendered more di&s;agreeable to both, from their oppo&s;ite &s;entiments in politics. Lord Shaft|&s;bury, who was the younger man, was the &s;urvivor; and the following account of Mr. Ha&s;tings, which I have &s;omewhat abridged, is &s;aid to have been the production of his pen.</P>
<P>Mr. Ha&s;tings was low of &s;tature, but very &s;trong, and very active; of a ruddy com|plexion, with flaxen hair. His cloaths were always of green cloth. His hou&s;e was of the old fa&s;hion; in the mid&s;t of a large park, well &s;tocked with deer, rabbits, and fi&s;h-ponds. He had a long narrow bowling-green, in it; and u&s;ed to play with round &s;and-bowls. Here too he had a banquetting-room built,
<PB N="24" REF="29">
like a &s;tand, in a large tree. He kept all &s;orts of hounds, that ran buck, fox, hare, otter, and badger; and had hawks of all kinds, both long, and &s;hort winged. His great hall was commonly &s;trewed with marrow-bones; and full of hawk-perches, hounds, &s;paniels, and terriers. The upper end of it was hung with fox-&s;kins of this, and the la&s;t year's killing. Here, and there a pole-cat was intermixed; and hunter's poles in great abun|dance. The parlour was a large room, compleatly furni&s;hed in the &s;ame &s;tile. On a broad hearth, paved with brick, lay &s;ome of the choice&s;t terriers, hounds, and &s;paniels. One or two of the great chairs, had litters of cats in them, which were not to be di&s;|turbed. Of the&s;e three or four always attended him at dinner; and a little white wand lay by his trencher; to defend it, if they were too trouble&s;ome. In the windows, which were very large, lay his arrows, cro&s;s-bows, and other accoutrements. The corners of the room were filled with his be&s;t hunting, and hawking poles. His oi&s;ter-table &s;tood at the lower end of the room, which was in con&s;tant u&s;e twice a day, all the year round; for he never failed to eat oi&s;ters both at dinner,
<PB N="25" REF="30">
and &s;upper; with which the neighbouring town of Pool &s;upplied him. At the upper end of the room &s;tood a &s;mall table with a double de&s;k; one &s;ide of which held a church-bible; the other, the book of martyrs. On different tables in the room lay hawk's-hoods; bells; old hats, with their crowns thru&s;t in, full of phea&s;ant eggs; tables; dice; cards; and &s;tore of tobacco-pipes. At one end of this room was a door, which opened into a clo&s;et; where &s;tood bottles of &s;trong beer, and wine; which never came out but in &s;ingle gla&s;&s;es, which was the rule of the hou&s;e; for he never exceeded him&s;elf; nor permitted others to exceed. An&s;wering to this clo&s;et, was a door into an old chapel; which had been long di&s;u&s;ed for devotion; but in the pulpit, as the &s;afe&s;t place, was always to be found a cold chine of beef, a veni&s;on-pa&s;ty, a gammon of bacon, or a great apple-pye, with thick cru&s;t, well-baked. His table co&s;t him not much, tho it was good to eat at. His &s;ports &s;upplied all, but beef and mutton; except on fridays, when he had the be&s;t of fi&s;h. He never wanted a London pudding; and he always &s;ang it in with, <HI>"My part lies therein-a."</HI> He drank a gla&s;s
<PB N="26" REF="31">
or two of wine at meals; put &s;yrup of gilly-flowers into his &s;ack; and had always a tun-gla&s;s of &s;mall-beer &s;tanding by him, which he often &s;tirred about with ro&s;emary. He lived to be an hundred; and never lo&s;t his eye-&s;ight, nor u&s;ed &s;pectacles. He got on hor&s;e-back without help; and rode to the death of the &s;tag, till he was pa&s;t four&s;core.</P>

<P><PB N="28" REF="33">The &s;oil of New-fore&s;t, which is in general a &s;andy loam, is well adapted to the production of oak-timber. This tract of woody country therefore hath long been con&s;idered, as one of the great magazines for the navy. It was formerly thought to be inexhau&s;tible; but by degrees it was ob&s;erved, that it began to fail. So early as in queen Elizabeth's reign, Manwood tells us, that "the &s;lender, and negligent execution of the fore&s;t-law hath been the decay, and de&s;truction (in almo&s;t all places within this realm) of great wood and timber; the want whereof, as well in this pre&s;ent time, as in time to come, &s;hall ap|pear in the navy of this realm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Manwood on fore&s;t-law, chap. ii. 6.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>In queen Elizabeth's reign Manwood's remark was &s;peculation; but in the reign of Charles II, it took the air of prediction. The decay of timber; which had long been gradually coming on, began then to be felt.
<PB N="29" REF="34">
It's &s;ources failed, as the demand increa&s;ed. In mo&s;t commodities the demands of a market immediately produce a &s;upply; but timber requires ages to make it marketable. It may be added, that the navy magazines had not then tho&s;e re&s;ources, which they have &s;ince found. Timber was with difficulty brought from the inland parts of the country, on account of the badne&s;s of the roads&mdash;little foreign timber was imported&mdash;and what ren|dered the evil more con&s;picuous, in Charles's time, the nation was on the eve of a naval war. Such pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity urged &s;trongly the propriety of making provi&s;ion for a future &s;upply. Charles, who had a &s;ort of turn for &s;hip-building, and had on that account, a kind of affection for the navy, was ea&s;ily induced to i&s;&s;ue an order, under his &s;ign manual, to &s;ir John Norton, woodward of New-fore&s;t, to inclo&s;e three hundred acres of wa&s;te, as a nur&s;ery for young oak<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Samber's MS.</NOTE>; the expence of which was to be defrayed by the &s;ale of decayed wood. This order bears date december 13th, 1669.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="35">But tho the inclo&s;ure, here &s;pecified, was trifling in it&s;elf, yet it had the merit of a new project, and led to farther improvements. A few years afterwards the &s;ame idea was taken up, on a more enlarged &s;cale. In the 10th of king William&punc; an act pa&s;&s;ed, im|powering certain commi&s;&s;ioners to inclo&s;e two thou&s;and acres in New-fore&s;t for the growth of timber; and two hundred more, every year; for the &s;pace of twenty years after|wards.</P>
<P>This provident act was as well executed, as it had been projected. A very con&s;iderable part of the quantity pre&s;cribed, at lea&s;t four thou&s;and acres, were inclo&s;ed, and planted<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Burley-walk above &s;ix hundred acres were inclo&s;ed&mdash;in Rhinefield-walk the &s;ame number&mdash;in Boldre-wood-walk above four hundred&mdash;in Egworth-walk one thou&s;and&mdash;in Bram|ble-hill-walk above &s;even hundred&mdash;in Dinney-walk above five hundred&mdash;in Ca&s;tle-Malwood-walk a quantity not a&s;certained.

None of it hath yet been felled, as it is not yet in a &s;tate of perfection; but it is in a very flouri&s;hing con|dition;
<PB N="31" REF="36">
and is at this day the glory of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>In the reigns of queen Ann, and George I, I believe, no new plantations were made; which is the more to be wondered at, as the &s;evere hurricane in the november of the year 1703 did great injury in New-fore&s;t. Not fewer than four thou&s;and of it's be&s;t oaks were de&s;troyed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Evelin's Sylva.</NOTE>, together with great quantities of growing timber.</P>
<P>In the reign of George II, three inclo&s;ures were made: but they were injudiciou&s;ly, or di&s;hone&s;tly managed; and Mr. Coleman, who undertook the bu&s;ine&s;s, was fined in the fore&s;t-court at Lyndhur&s;t, by the verderors, for his neglect<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Samber's MS.</NOTE>. Some attempts have been made in the pre&s;ent reign: but for want of being properly planned, or hone&s;tly managed, very little advantage hath accrued<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the year 1782 an inquiry was in&s;tituted, by an order from the trea&s;ury, into the quantities of navy-timber in New-fore&s;t&mdash;that is, &s;uch timber, as would mea&s;ure thirty-five cubic feet. The quantity given in, after a very nice &s;urvey, was fifty-two thou&s;and load.&mdash;Forty cubic feet make a load.&mdash;At the &s;ame time the timber in Dean-fore&s;t was &s;urveyed; which, tho of much &s;maller dimen&s;ions than New-fore&s;t, con|tained &s;ixty-two thou&s;and load.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="37">The great defect indeed here, as in other national matters, is the want of hone&s;ty. Public affairs become private jobs. Large inclo&s;ures have been made merely to inrich the undertakers by the profits of inclo&s;ing; or the plunder of the underwood. It is &s;aid, that altho the flouri&s;hing plantations made by king William, are at this time, receiving injury from growing too clo&s;e; they are rather &s;uffered to continue as they are, than to run the hazard of being di&s;hone&s;tly thinned. For it has &s;ometimes been found, that in thin|ning trees, the be&s;t, in&s;tead of the wor&s;t, have been removed: nor can any thing prevent &s;uch mi&s;chief, but the care, and hone&s;ty of fore&s;t-officers, and the per&s;ons they employ.</P>
<P>What a general rapacity reigns in fore&s;ts, may be conceived from the deva&s;tation, which even inferior officers have been able to com|mit. Not many years ago, two men, of the name of Batten, father and &s;on, &s;uc|ceeded each other, in the office of under-keeper, in one of the fore&s;t-walks. The under-keeper is &s;uppo&s;ed to cut holm, and
<PB N="33" REF="38">
other under-wood of little value, to browze his deer; and when the rind, and &s;pray are eaten off, he faggots the dry &s;ticks for his own u&s;e. But the&s;e fellows cut down the young timber of the fore&s;t, without di&s;|tinction, and without mea&s;ure, which they made up into faggots, and &s;old: and for this paltry gain I have been informed, they com|mitted wa&s;te in the fore&s;t e&s;timated at fifty thou&s;and pounds damage. The calculation &s;eems large: but we may well imagine, that in the unremitted cour&s;e of &s;ixty or &s;eventy years, great mi&s;chief might be done. For tho a young &s;apling may not intrin&s;ically be worth more than half a crown; yet the great difficulty of getting another thriving plant to occupy it's room in the fore&s;t, rai&s;es it's con|&s;equence to the public much beyond it's mere &s;pecific value.</P>
<P>But the decay of fore&s;ts is not owing &s;olely either to the legal con&s;umer, or the rapa|cious tre&s;pa&s;&s;er. The oak of the fore&s;t will &s;ometimes naturally fail. Mr. Evelin re|marks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Sylva.</NOTE>, that every fore&s;t, in which oak,
<PB N="34" REF="39">
and beech grow promi&s;cuou&s;ly, will in a cour&s;e of ages become intirely beechen. If this be a ju&s;t remark, the oak, we are to &s;uppo&s;e, has not &s;o &s;trong a vegetative power, as the beech; which, in time prevails over the whole.&mdash;Whatever truth there may be in the ob&s;ervation, certain it is, that this appearance of decay is found in many of the wood-lands of New-fore&s;t, which con&s;i&s;t chiefly of beech, and unthriving oak.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;ources of mi&s;chief, the woods of the fore&s;t are &s;ubject to another, that of fire. In &s;ultry weather, it's furzy heaths are very combu&s;tible; and the neighbouring cottagers are &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ometimes to &s;et them purpo&s;ely on fire to make pa&s;turage more plentiful. The danger ari&s;es from the dif|ficulty of &s;topping the&s;e fires, which will &s;ometimes continue burning, more or le&s;s, at the mercy of the wind, during &s;everal days.

<P><PB N="35" REF="40">From the&s;e, and other cau&s;es, many parts of this exten&s;ive fore&s;t are now in a &s;tate of extreme decay; being over&s;pread merely with holmes, underwood, and &s;tunted trees, which in the memory of man were full of excellent oak<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Samber's MS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In planting oak, it hath been a doubt, whether it is more judicious to &s;ow the acorn, after inclo&s;ing, and grubbing the ground&mdash;
<PB N="36" REF="41">
or to &s;ow it, without either operation, in the wild parts of the fore&s;t, in the mid&s;t of thorn-bu&s;hes, and hollies, which will defend the &s;apling from cattle, till it be able to &s;tand alone; and will draw it in it's early &s;tate to much quicker maturity, than it can arrive at without &s;uch &s;helter. The latter way of &s;owing acorns, in the wild parts of the fore&s;t, is not &s;o &s;ure, but much larger quan|tities may be &s;own at a much le&s;s expence; and if one tenth part of the acorns &s;ucceed, the &s;aving is great on an equal quantity of timber. I cannot however help doubting the efficacy of this mode of rai&s;ing timber; tho I have often heard &s;en&s;ible people, who have lived in the neighbourhood of the fore&s;t, &s;peak favourably of it: and it is certain that timber is often rai&s;ed fortuitou&s;ly in this manner. We &s;ee in the wild parts of the fore&s;t, trees, which have attained the growth of ten, twenty, or thirty years, as far as we can judge, without any aid: and we are at a lo&s;s to know, how nature manages a work of this kind, and rears this ex|po&s;ed part of her offspring, amid&s;t deer, and cattle. And yet we &s;ee the &s;ame kind pro|vidence in a higher part of the creation.
<PB N="37" REF="42">
We &s;ee the children of the cottage, expo&s;ed to mi&s;chief on every &s;ide, and continually running ri&s;ks, which delicate mothers would tremble at: yet befriended by a gracious protector, they get forward in life, and attain maturity, like the wildings of the fore&s;t, in a manner, which they who &s;peculate only on human means, cannot ea&s;ily conceive.</P>
<P>In planting the fore&s;t, &s;ome again have been advocates for uniting the two modes I have &s;pecified. The ground is inclo&s;ed, but not grubbed, and the acorns &s;own at random. The late duke of Bedford, when he was lord warden, was very intent on rai&s;ing timber in this fortuitous manner. He merely inclo&s;ed and left it to chance to fill his inclo&s;ures. But I do not find that any of them have &s;ucceeded.&mdash;If the ground were inclo&s;ed, and a &s;pot here and there, grubbed, in which two or three acorns were &s;own; and &s;ome little care taken afterwards of the infant-wood, it might be of all others, per|haps, the mo&s;t certain, and the lea&s;t expen&s;ive, way of rai&s;ing timber.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="43">But the <HI>woods</HI> of the fore&s;t have not alone been the objects of deva&s;tation; it's <HI>lands</HI> al&s;o have &s;uffered. After the fore&s;t had lo&s;t it's great legal &s;upport, and rea&s;ons of &s;tate obliged the monarch to &s;eek his amu&s;ements nearer home, the extent of the&s;e royal de|mei&s;ns began in&s;en&s;ibly to dimini&s;h. New-fore&s;t, among others, was greatly curtailed. Large portions of it were given away in grants by the crown. Many gentlemen have hou&s;es in it's interior parts; and their te|nants are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of well cultivated farms. For tho the &s;oil of New-fore&s;t is, in general, poor; yet there are &s;ome parts of it, which very happily admit culture. Thus the fore&s;t has &s;uffered in many places, what it's ancient laws con&s;idered as the greate&s;t of all mi&s;chiefs, under the name of an <HI>a&s;&s;art</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Manwood, ch. ix. &s;ec. 1.</NOTE>; a word, which &s;ignifies grubbing up it's coverts, and cop&s;es, and turning the harbours of deer into arable land. A &s;top however is now put to all grants from the
<PB N="39" REF="44">
crown. The crown-lands became public property under the care of the trea&s;ury, when the civil li&s;t was &s;ettled. The king can only grant lea&s;es for thirty years; and the parliament &s;eldom interferes in a longer ex|ten&s;ion, except on particular occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e defalcations ari&s;ing from the bounty of the crown, the fore&s;t is continually preyed on by the incroachments of inferior people. There are multitudes of tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers, on every &s;ide of it, who build their little huts, and inclo&s;e their little gardens, and patches of ground, without leave, or cere|mony of any kind. The under-keepers, who have con&s;tant orders to de&s;troy all the&s;e in|clo&s;ures, now and then a&s;&s;ert the rights of the fore&s;t by throwing down a fence; but it requires a legal proce&s;s to throw down a hou&s;e, of which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion has been taken. The tre&s;pa&s;&s;er therefore here, as on other wa&s;tes, is careful to rear his cottage, and get into it as quickly as po&s;&s;ible. I have known all the materials of one of the&s;e ha|bitations brought together&mdash;the hou&s;e built &mdash;covered in&mdash;the goods removed&mdash;a fire kindled&mdash;and the family in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, during the cour&s;e of a moon-light night. Some|times

indeed, where the tre&s;pa&s;s is incon|&s;iderable, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or has been allowed to pay a fine for his land in the court of Lynd|hur&s;t. But the&s;e tre&s;pa&s;&s;es are generally in the out&s;kirts of the fore&s;t; or in the neigh|bourhood of &s;ome little hamlet. They are never &s;uffered in the interior parts; where no lands are alienated from the crown, except in regular grants.</P>
<P>The many advantages, which the borderers on fore&s;ts enjoy, &s;uch as rearing cattle, and hogs, obtaining fuel at an ea&s;y rate, and procuring little patches of land for the trouble of inclo&s;ing it, would add much, one &s;hould imagine, to the comfort of their lives. But in fact it is otherwi&s;e. The&s;e advantages procure them not half the enjoyments of common day-labourers. In general, they are an indolent race; poor and wretched in the extreme. In&s;tead of having the regular re|turns of a week's labour to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on, too many of them depend on the precarious &s;upply of fore&s;t pilfer. Their o&s;ten&s;ible bu&s;ine&s;s is commonly to cut furze, and carry it to the neighbouring brick-kilns; for which purpo&s;e they keep a team of two or three fore&s;t-hor&s;es: while their collateral &s;upport is deer-&s;tealing,
<PB N="41" REF="46">
poaching, or purloining timber. In this la&s;t occupation they are &s;aid to have been &s;o expert, that, in a night's time, they would have cut down, carried off, and lodged &s;afely in the hands of &s;ome receiver, one of the large&s;t oaks of the fore&s;t. But the depredations, which have been made in timber, along all the &s;kirts of the fore&s;t, have rendered this &s;pecies of theft, at pre&s;ent, but an unprofitable employment. In poaching, and deer-&s;tealing they often find their be&s;t account; in all the arts of which many of them are well pacti&s;ed. From their ealie&s;t youth they learn to &s;et the trap, and the gin for hares, and phea&s;ants; to in&s;nare deer by hanging hooks, baited with apples, from the boughs of trees; and (as they became bolder proficients,) to watch the herd with fire-arms, and &s;ingle out a fat buck, as he pa&s;&s;es the place of their con|cealment.</P>
<P>In wild rugged countries, the mountane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> forms a very different character from the fore&s;ter. He leads a life of labour: he pro|cures nothing without it. He has neither time for idlene&s;s, and di&s;hone&s;t arts; nor meets with any thing to allure him into them. But the fore&s;ter, who has the temptation of
<PB N="42" REF="47">
plunder on every &s;ide, finds it ea&s;ier to tre&s;|pa&s;s, than to work. Hence, the one becomes often a rough, manly ingenuous pea&s;ant; the other a &s;upple, crafty, pilfering knave. Even the very practice of following a night-oc|cupation leads to mi&s;chief. The nightly wanderer, unle&s;s his mind be engaged in &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, will find many temp|tations to take the advantage of the incautious &s;ecurity of tho&s;e who are a&s;leep.&mdash;From the&s;e con&s;iderations Mr. St. John draws an argument for the &s;ale of fore&s;t-lands. "Poverty, &s;ays he, will be changed into affluence&mdash;the cottager will become a farmer&mdash;the wilderne&s;s will be converted into rich pa&s;tures, and fertile fields; furni&s;hing provi&s;ions for the country, and employment for the poor.

<P>I had once &s;ome occa&s;ional intercour&s;e with a fore&s;t-borderer, who had formerly been a noted deer-&s;tealer. He had often (like the deer-&s;tealer in the play)
<Q><L>&mdash;&s;truck a doe,</L>
<L>And born her cleanly by the keeper's no&s;e.</L></Q>
Indeed he had been at the head of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion; and during a reign of five years, a&s;&s;ured me, he had killed, on an average, not fewer than an hundred bucks a year. At length he was obliged to ab&s;cond; but compo&s;ing his affairs, he abjured his trade, and would &s;peak of his former arts without re&s;erve. He has oftener than once confe&s;&s;ed the &s;ins of his youth to me; from which an idea may be formed of the my&s;tery of deer-&s;tealing, in it's highe&s;t mode of perfection. In his excur&s;ions in the fore&s;t he carried with him a gun, which &s;crewed into three parts, and which he could ea&s;ily conceal in the lining of his coat. Thus armed he would
<PB N="44" REF="49">
drink with the under-keepers without &s;u&s;|picion; and when he knew them engaged, would &s;ecurely take his &s;tand in &s;ome di&s;tant part, and mark his buck. When he had killed him, he would draw him a&s;ide into the bu&s;hes, and &s;pend the remaining part of the day in a neighbouring tree, that he might be &s;ure no &s;pies were in the way. At night he &s;ecreted his plunder. He had boarded off a part of his cottage, (forming a rough door into it, like the re&s;t of the partition, &s;truck full of fal&s;e nail-heads,) with &s;uch artifice, that the keepers, on an information, have &s;earched his hou&s;e again and again, and have gone off &s;atisfied of his innocence; tho his &s;ecret larder perhaps at that very time con|tained a brace of bucks. He had always, he &s;aid, a quick market for his veni&s;on; for the country is as ready to purcha&s;e it, as the&s;e fellows are to procure it. It is a fore&s;t-adage of ancient date, <HI>non e&s;t inquirendum unde venit veni&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>The incroachments of tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers, and the hou&s;es, and fences thus rai&s;ed on the borders of the fore&s;t, tho, at this time, in a degree connived at, were heretofore con&s;idered as great nui&s;ances by the old fore&s;t-law, and
<PB N="45" REF="50">
were very &s;everely puni&s;hed under the name of <HI>purpre&s;tures,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Manwood, chapter x. &s;ec. 1.</NOTE> as tending <HI>ad terrorem fera|rum &mdash;ad nocumentum fore&s;tae</HI>&mdash;and, as might be added, at this time, by the neighbouring pari&s;hes, <HI>ad incrementum pauperum.</HI> When a &s;tranger therefore rears one of the&s;e &s;udden fabricks, the pari&s;h-officers make him provide a certificate from his own pari&s;h, or they remove him. But the mi&s;chief commonly ari&s;es from a pari&s;hioner's rai&s;ing his cottage, and afterwards &s;elling it to a &s;tranger, which may give him pari&s;h-rights. The&s;e incroach|ments however are evils of &s;o long &s;tanding; that at this day they hardly admit a remedy. Many of the&s;e little tenements have been &s;o long occupied, and have pa&s;&s;ed through &s;o many hands, that the occupiers are now in &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

When we &s;ee them, as we &s;ometimes do, the habitations of innocence, and indu&s;try; and the means of providing for a large family with ea&s;e, and comfort, we are plea&s;ed at the idea of &s;o much utility and happine&s;s, ari&s;ing from a petty tre&s;pa&s;s on a wa&s;te, which cannot in it&s;elf be con&s;idered as an injury.</P>
<P>I once found, in a tenement of this kind, an ancient widow, who&s;e little &s;tory plea&s;ed me.&mdash;Her &s;olitary dwelling &s;tood &s;weetly in a dell, on the edge of the fore&s;t. Her hu&s;band had him&s;elf reared it, and led her to it, as the
<PB N="47" REF="52">
habitation of her life. He had made a garden in the front, planted an orchard at one end, and a few trees at the other, which in forty years had now &s;hielded the cottage, and almo&s;t concealed it. In her early youth &s;he had been left a widow with two &s;ons, and a daughter, who&s;e &s;lender education (only what &s;he her&s;elf could give them) was almo&s;t her whole em|ployment: and the time of their youth, &s;he &s;aid, was the plea&s;ante&s;t time of her life. As they grew up, and the cares of the world &s;ub&s;ided, a &s;ettled piety took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind. Her age was oppre&s;&s;ed with infirmity, &s;ickne&s;s, and various afflictions in her family. In the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, her bible was her great comfort. I vi&s;ited her frequently in her la&s;t illne&s;s, and found her very intelligent in &s;cripture, and well ver&s;ed in all the go&s;pel-topics of con&s;olation. For many years &s;he every day read a portion of her bible, &s;eldom any other book;
<Q><L>Ju&s;t knew, and knew no more, her bible true;</L>
<L>And in that charter read with &s;parkling eyes,</L>
<L>Her title to a trea&s;ure in the &s;kies.</L></Q>
When &s;he met with pa&s;&s;ages, &s;he did not under&s;tand, at one time, or other, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he often heard them explained at church.&mdash;

It's woody &s;cenes, it's extended lawns, and va&s;t &s;weeps of wild country, unlimited by artificial boundaries, together with it's river-views, and di&s;tant coa&s;ts; are all in a great degree magnificent.

<P>ON looking into a map of New-fore&s;t, and drawing an imaginary line from Ringwood on the Avon, to Dibden on the bay of Southampton, the whole fore&s;t ea&s;ily divides it&s;elf into four parts. That di&s;trict, which lies north of this imaginary line, we may call one part. The river Avon, and Lymington-river make the boundaries of a &s;econd: Lymington-river, and Beaulieu-river of a third: and the country between this la&s;t river, and the bay of Southampton, may be con&s;idered as a fourth.</P>
<P>When I &s;poke of fore&s;ts in general, as con&s;i&s;ting of large tracts of heathy-land, and carpet-lawns, inter&s;per&s;ed with woods<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. I. p. 210.</NOTE>,
<PB N="52" REF="58">
I had a particular view to the &s;cenery of New-fore&s;t, which is preci&s;ely of this kind. It's lawns and woods are every where divided by large di&s;tricts of heath. Many of the&s;e woods have formerly been, as many of the heaths at pre&s;ent are, of va&s;t extent; run|ning &s;everal miles without interruption. Dif|ferent parts too both of the open, and of the woody country, are &s;o high, as to command exten&s;ive di&s;tances, tho no part can in any degree a&s;&s;ume the title of mountainous.</P>
<P>Along the banks of the Avon, from Ringwood to the &s;ea, the whole &s;urface is flat, inclo&s;ed, and cultivated. There is little beauty in this part. Ea&s;tward from Chri&s;t-church, along the coa&s;t, as far as to the e&s;tuary of Lymington-river we have al&s;o a continued flat. Much heathy ground is in|ter&s;per&s;ed; but no woody &s;cenery, except in &s;ome narrow glen, through which a ri|vulet happens to find it's way to the &s;ea. In two or three of the&s;e there is &s;ome beauty. &mdash;Here the coa&s;t, which is expo&s;ed to the ocean, and formed by the violence of &s;torms, is edged by a broken cliff, from
<PB N="53" REF="59">
which are pre&s;ented grand &s;ea-views, &s;ome|times embelli&s;hed with winding &s;hores. As we leave the coa&s;t, and a&s;cend more into the mid-land parts of this divi&s;ion, the &s;cenery improves. The ground is more varied; woods and lawns are inter&s;per&s;ed: and many of them are among the mo&s;t beautiful exhibitions of this kind, which the fore&s;t pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>In the next divi&s;ion, which is contained between the rivers of Lymington, and Beaulieu, we have al&s;o great variety of beautiful country. The coa&s;t indeed is flat, and unedged with cliff; as it lies oppo&s;ite to the i&s;le of Wight, which defends it from the violence of the ocean: but the views it pre&s;ents, are &s;ometimes intere&s;ting. It is wooded in many parts almo&s;t to the water's edge; and the i&s;land appearing like a di&s;tant range of mountains, gives the channel the form of a grand lake. &mdash;As we leave the &s;ea, the ground ri&s;es, and the woods take more po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, e&s;pecially along the banks of the two rivers I have ju&s;t mentioned, which afford on each &s;ide for a con&s;iderable &s;pace, many beautiful &s;cenes. There are heathy grounds in this
<PB N="54" REF="60">
di&s;trict al&s;o; but they occupy chiefly the middle parts between the&s;e two tracts of wood-land.</P>
<P>In that divi&s;ion of New-fore&s;t, which is confined by Beaulieu-river, and the bay of Southampton, the mid-land parts are heathy as in the la&s;t; but the banks, and vicinity both of the river, and the bay, are woody, and full of beautiful &s;cenery. This divi&s;ion is perhaps, on the whole, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting of the fore&s;t. For be&s;ides it's woods, there is greater variety of ground, than in any other part. Here al&s;o are grander water-views, than are exhibited any where el&s;e. The views along the banks of Beaulieu-river, it has in common with the la&s;t divi&s;ion; but tho&s;e over the bay of Southampton, are wholly it's own.&mdash;One di&s;agreeable cir|cum&s;tance attends all the &s;ea-views, which are oppo&s;ite to the i&s;le of Wight, and that is, the ouzine&s;s of the beach, when the &s;ea retires. A pebbly, or a &s;andy &s;hore, has as good an effect often when the &s;ea ebbs, as when it is full&mdash;&s;ometimes perhaps a better: but an ouzy one has an unplea&s;ant hue. However this &s;hore is one of the be&s;t of
<PB N="55" REF="61">
the kind; for the ouze here is generally covered with green &s;ea-weed, which as the tide retires, gives it the appearance of level land de&s;erted by the &s;ea, and turned into meadow. But the&s;e lands are meadows only in <HI>&s;urface;</HI> for they have no pa&s;toral accompaniments.</P>
<P>The northern divi&s;ion of New-fore&s;t contains all tho&s;e parts, which lie north of Ringwood and Dibden. As this di&s;trict is at a di&s;tance from the &s;ea, and not inter&s;ected by any river, whch de&s;erves more than the name of a brook, it is adorned by no water-views, except near Dibden, where the fore&s;t is bounded by the extremity of the bay of Southampton. The want of water however is recompen&s;ed by grand woody &s;cenes, in which this part of the fore&s;t equals, if not exceeds, any other part.&mdash;In noble di&s;tances al&s;o it excels; for here the ground &s;wells higher, than in the more maritime parts; and the di&s;tances, which the&s;e heights com|mand, con&s;i&s;t often of va&s;t exten&s;ive fore&s;t-&s;cenes.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="62">Be&s;ides the heaths, lawns, and woods, of which the fore&s;t is compo&s;ed, there is another kind of &s;urface found in many parts, which comes under none of the&s;e denominations, and that is the bog. Many parts of the fore&s;t abound in &s;prings; and as the&s;e lands have ever been in a &s;tate of nature, and of cour&s;e undrained, the moi&s;ture drains it&s;elf into the low grounds, where, as u&s;ual in other rude countries, it becomes &s;oft, and &s;pongy, and generates bogs. The&s;e in &s;ome places are very exten&s;ive. In the road between Brokenhur&s;t, and Ringwood, at a place called Long&s;lade bottom; one of the&s;e bogs extends three miles, without in|terruption, and is the common drain of all tho&s;e parts of the fore&s;t. In land&s;cape indeed the bog is of little prejudice. It has in general the appearance of common verdure. But the traveller mu&s;t be on his guard. The&s;e tracts of deceitful ground are often dangerous to &s;uch as leave the beaten roads; and traver&s;e the paths of fore&s;t. A hor&s;e-track is not always the clue of &s;ecurity. It is perhaps only beaten by the little fore&s;t-hor&s;e, which will venture into a bog in que&s;t of better herbage; and his
<PB N="57" REF="63">
lightne&s;s &s;ecures him in a place, where a larger hor&s;e, under the weight of a rider, would flounder. If the traveller therefore meet with a hor&s;e-path, pointing into a &s;wamp, even tho he &s;hould ob&s;erve it to emerge on the other &s;ide, he had better relinqui&s;h it. The only track he can prudently follow, is that of wheels.</P>
<P>Having thus pre&s;ented the reader with a general view of New-fore&s;t, I &s;hall now en|deavour to give him a more intimate acquain|tance with it, and &s;hall lead him into &s;ome of it's mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenes.&mdash;Nor was the beauty of the fore&s;t a matter of no concern, even at a time, when we might have &s;uppo&s;ed the plea&s;ures of the cha&s;e ingro&s;&s;ed men's whole attention. "There are three &s;pecial cau&s;es, &s;ays Manwood, why the fore&s;t-laws have &s;o carefully provided for the pre&s;ervation of the <HI>vert</HI> of the fore&s;t. The fir&s;t is for the &s;ake of cover for the deer. The &s;econd for the &s;ake of the acorns, ma&s;t, &amp;c. which feed them. The third is, <HI>propter decorem,</HI> for the comeline&s;s and beauty of the &s;ame in a fore&s;t. For the very &s;ight, and beholding of the

<Q>Remarks on the we&s;tern parts of New-fore&s;t, from Vicar's-hill to Ringwood; and from thence, through Chri&s;t-church to Lymington.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FROM Vicar's-hill, we pa&s;&s;ed Boldre-bridge, and a&s;cending the oppo&s;ite bank, called Rope-hill, to Battram&s;ly, we had a beautiful view of the e&s;tuary of Lymington river; which when filled with the tide, forms a grand &s;weep to the &s;ea. It is &s;een to mo&s;t advantage from the top of the hill, a few yards out of the road on the right. The valley, through which the river flows, is broad; it's &s;creens are not lofty, but well varied, and woody. The curves of the river are marked by long projections of low land, and on one or two of them &s;ome little &s;altern,
<PB N="62" REF="67">
or other building is erected, which breaks the lines. The di&s;tance is formed by the &s;ea, and the i&s;le of Wight. All together the view is picture&s;que. It is what the painter properly calls <HI>a whole.</HI> There is a fore-ground, a middle-ground, and di&s;tance&mdash;all harmoniou&s;ly united.&mdash;We have the &s;ame view, only varied by po&s;ition, from many high grounds in the neighbourhood; but I know not, that it appears to &s;uch advantage any where as from this hill.&mdash;At Battram&s;ly we join the London-road.</P>
<P>From hence to Brokenhur&s;t, the fore&s;t exhibits little more than a wild heath, &s;kirted here and there with di&s;tant wood.</P>
<P>Brokenhur&s;t is a plea&s;ant fore&s;t-village, lying in a bottom, adorned with lawns, groves, and rivulets, and &s;urrounded on the higher grounds by va&s;t woods.&mdash;From the church-yard an expanded view opens over the whole. On the left ri&s;e the woods of Hin|chel&s;ea, and adjoining to the&s;e, the woods of Rhinville. The centre is occupied by the high grounds of Boldre-wood. The little &s;peck ju&s;t &s;een among them, is a &s;ummer-hou&s;e, built by lord Delawar to command a fore&s;t-view. The hou&s;e among the woods on the
<PB N="63" REF="68">
right is Cuffnel's, the &s;eat of Mr. Ro&s;e; and &s;till more to the right, are the woods of Lyndhur&s;t.</P>
<P>At the entrance of Brokenhur&s;t, a little to the right, Mr. Morant's hou&s;e commands a very grand, and picture&s;que fore&s;t-view. Both the fore-ground, and the di&s;tance, are com|plete.</P>
<P>The former is an elevated park-&s;cene, con&s;i&s;ting of great variety of ground; well-planted; and de&s;cending gently into the plain below. Among the trees, which adorn it, are a few of the olde&s;t, and mo&s;t venerable oaks of the fore&s;t. I doubt not but they chronicle on their furrowed trunks ages before the conque&s;t.</P>
<P>From this grand fore-ground is pre&s;ented an exten&s;ive fore&s;t-view. It con&s;i&s;ts of a wide range of flat pa&s;turage (one of the &s;preading lawns of the fore&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 210.</NOTE>) garni&s;hed with tufted clumps and woody promontories &s;hooting into it; and contra&s;ted by immen&s;e woods, which occupy all the ri&s;ing grounds above it, and
<PB N="64" REF="69">
circle the horizon. The contra&s;t between the open, and woody parts of the di&s;tance, and the grandeur of each part, are in the highe&s;t &s;tile of picture&s;que beauty.</P>
<P>This grand view is di&s;played to mo&s;t advan|tage from the front of the hou&s;e: but it is &s;een al&s;o very advantageou&s;ly through other openings among the trees of the fore-ground.</P>
<P>As you leave the village of Brokenhur&s;t, the woods receive you in a noble ri&s;ing vi&s;ta, in which form the road is cut through the fore&s;t. This vi&s;ta is exceedingly grand. A <HI>winding road</HI> through a wood, has undoubtedly more beauty than a <HI>vi&s;ta;</HI> and in a &s;maller &s;cene we always wi&s;h to find it; and even reprobate the vi&s;ta, wherever it occurs. But through a va&s;t fore&s;t the vi&s;ta is in better ta&s;te; tho I do not in the lea&s;t apprehend we are under obligations, on this &s;core, to the &s;urveyor of the high-ways. He took the direct road; which happened, on this occa&s;ion, to be the line of beauty. On other occa&s;ions, under the &s;ame principle, he has mi&s;&s;ed it: but here it &s;uits the greatne&s;s of the &s;cene; and &s;hews the depth of the fore&s;t, and the
<PB N="65" REF="70">
va&s;tne&s;s of the woods, to more advantage. <HI>Regular forms</HI> are certainly unpicture&s;que; but from their &s;implicity, they are often allied to greatne&s;s. So e&s;&s;ential is &s;implicity to greatne&s;s, that we often &s;ee in&s;tances, in which the &s;tillne&s;s of &s;ymmetry hath added to gran|deur, if not produced it; while on the other hand, we as often &s;ee a &s;ublime effect injured by the meretricious charms of picture&s;que forms, and arrangements.</P>
<P>We are not however to conceive of the fore&s;t-vi&s;ta, as we do of the tame vi&s;tas formed by the hand of art. As it is cut through a tract of woody country, there is fir&s;t, of cour&s;e, no formality in the di&s;po&s;ition of the trees. In the artificial vi&s;ta, the trees are all of one age, and planted in regular growth. The whole plan is the offspring of formality; and the more formal it is, the nearer it ap|proaches that idea of perfection, at which it aims. But in the fore&s;t-vi&s;ta the trees are ca&s;ually large, or &s;mall; growing in clumps, or &s;tanding &s;ingle; crouding upon the fore|ground, or receding from it; as the wild hand of nature hath &s;cattered them. And it is curious to &s;ee with what richne&s;s of inven|tion, if I may &s;o &s;peak, nature mixes, and
<PB N="66" REF="71">
intermixes her trees; and &s;hapes them into &s;uch a wonderful variety of groups, and beautiful forms. Art may admire, and at|tempt to plant, and form combinations, and clumps like hers: but whoever examines the wild combinations of a fore&s;t (which is a delightful &s;tudy to a picture&s;que eye) and compares them with the attempts of art, has little ta&s;te, if he do not acknowledge with a&s;toni&s;hment, the &s;uperiority of nature's work|man&s;hip.</P>
<P>The artificial vi&s;ta again is rarely compo&s;ed of more than one &s;pecies. It is the fir, the lime, or the elm. But in the fore&s;t-vi&s;ta you have not only different kinds of trees in|termixed; but bu&s;hes al&s;o, and underwood, and wild plants of all kinds, which are continually producing new varieties in every part.</P>
<P>Open groves too make another variety in the fore&s;t-vi&s;ta. In the woods between Bro|kenhur&s;t, and Lyndhur&s;t, an open grove is continued on the right, with little interrup|tion, between the &s;eventh and eighth &s;tones. The woods on the left are chiefly clo&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the&s;e grand vi&s;tas are not only varied with &s;uch &s;maller openings, and rece&s;&s;es,
<PB N="67" REF="72">
as are formed by the irregular growth of trees; they are broken al&s;o by lawns, and tracts of pa&s;turage, which often &s;hoot athwart them. One of this kind, and a very beautiful one, occurs at the &s;ixth &s;tone, and another, tho of inferior &s;ize and beauty, at the &s;eventh.</P>
<P>Added to this intermixture of lawn and wood, the ri&s;ing and falling of the ground in various parts of this vi&s;ta produce another &s;pecies of variety. The elevation is no where con&s;iderable; but it is &s;ufficient to occa&s;ion breaks in the convergency of the great per|&s;pective lines. It creates al&s;o new beauties in the &s;cenery; particularly in &s;ome parts on the left, where you look down from the road, among trees retiring, and &s;inking from the eye, till the &s;tems of the mo&s;t di&s;tant are lo&s;t in the deep &s;hadows of the de&s;cending rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>All the&s;e circum&s;tances, tho the la&s;t is more general, give the <HI>fore&s;t-vi&s;ta</HI> a very different air from the <HI>artificial one,</HI> diver|&s;ifying <HI>the parts,</HI> of which it is compo&s;ed, &s;o much, that the eye is never fatigued with &s;urveying them; while <HI>the whole together</HI> pre&s;ents one va&s;t, &s;ublime object. Like a grand gallery of exqui&s;ite pictures, it fills the eye with all it's greatne&s;s; while the objects,
<PB N="68" REF="73">
on each &s;ide, continually changing, afford at every &s;tep a new entertainment.</P>
<P>A late traveller through Ru&s;&s;ia does not &s;ee the&s;e beauties in a fore&s;t-vi&s;ta. "The country, &s;ays he, through which we pa&s;&s;ed, was ill-calculated to alleviate our &s;ufferings by transferring our attention from our&s;elves to the objects around us. The road ran, as &s;trait as an arrow, through a perpetual fore&s;t. Through the dreary extent of a hundred and ten miles, the gloomy uniformity was only broken by a few &s;olitary villages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I beg the reader's pardon for not quoting my author. I certainly met with the pa&s;&s;age; but not noting the reference at the time; and not opening my MS. for &s;ometime afterwards, it has now e&s;caped me.</NOTE>."&mdash;No doubt the continuation of a hundred and ten miles in any <HI>one mode of &s;cenery</HI> may be rather fatiguing: but I &s;hould have thought, that few modes of &s;cenery were better calculated to <HI>transfer the attention</HI> from a di&s;agreeable &s;ubject. I know not indeed what the nature of a vi&s;ta through a Ru&s;&s;ian fore&s;t may be: but if it partake of the circum&s;tances that I have ju&s;t been de&s;cribing, in this vi&s;ta through New-fore&s;t, it mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of varieties, which could not ea&s;ily be exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="74">The account I have here given of the fore&s;t-vi&s;ta is the &s;ober re&s;ult of frequent examination. A tran&s;cript of the fir&s;t feelings would have been rhap&s;ody; which no de&s;cription &s;hould indulge. The de&s;criber imagines that his own feelings of a natural &s;cene can be conveyed by warm expre&s;&s;ions. Whereas nothing but the <HI>&s;cene it&s;elf</HI> can convey his <HI>feelings.</HI> Loo&s;e ideas (not truth, but veri&s;imilitude) is all that <HI>verbal de&s;cription</HI> pretends to convey; and this is not to be done by high colouring; but to be aimed at by plain, appropriate, intelli|gible terms.</P>
<P>I &s;hould add, before I leave this plea&s;ing vi&s;ta, that to &s;ee it in perfection, a &s;trong &s;un-&s;hine is nece&s;&s;ary. Even a meridian &s;un, which has a better effect on the woods of the fore&s;t, than on any other &s;pecies of land&s;cape<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See v. i. page 242.</NOTE>, is not perhaps too &s;trong for &s;uch a &s;cene as this. It will rarely happen, but that one &s;ide, or the other of the vi&s;ta will be in &s;hadow; and this circum&s;tance alone will produce contra&s;ts, which will be highly agreeable.&mdash;I may add al&s;o, that this vi&s;ta
<PB N="70" REF="75">
appears to much greater advantage, as we ri&s;e through it to Lyndhur&s;t, than as we de&s;cend to Brokenhur&s;t.</P>
<P>As we pa&s;&s;ed this vi&s;ta, we &s;aw, in many parts through the trees, on the left, the pales of New-park, ju&s;t removed from the road. This park, which is the only one in the whole di&s;trict of New-fore&s;t, is about four miles in circumference. It was fir&s;t u&s;ed to &s;ecure &s;tray cattle forfeited to the lord-warden: but in the year 1670, it was &s;trongly fenced by Charles II. for the reception of a particular breed of red-deer, which he procured from France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The expence of this work &s;tands thus in the trea&s;ury-books.</P>

of fine timber. Mo&s;t of the be&s;t trees have been felled. The land&s;cape however is not much injured. On a fore-ground indeed, when we have a &s;ingle tree, we wi&s;h it to be of the noble&s;t kind; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that in our pa&s;&s;age through this vi&s;ta, which in every part as we pa&s;s along becomes a fore-ground, there is a great de|ficiency of noble trees. Many of the oaks are &s;cathed, and ragged; and tho in com|po&s;ition trees of this kind have frequently their effect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See v. I. page 8.</NOTE>; yet in a rich fore&s;t-&s;cene, if they pre&s;ent them&s;elves too often, offend. For all the other purpo&s;es of &s;cenery, in|ferior trees, if they be full grown, an&s;wer tolerably well; and when intermixed with &s;tunted trees, and bru&s;h-wood, as they are in all the wild parts of the fore&s;t, they are more beautiful, than if the whole &s;cene was compo&s;ed of trees of the &s;tatelie&s;t order. Inter&s;tices are better filled; and a more <HI>uni|form whole</HI> is produced.&mdash;Con&s;idered in this light a fore&s;t is a picture of the world. We find trees of all ages, kinds, and degrees
<PB N="72" REF="77">
&mdash;the old, and the young&mdash;the rich, and the poor&mdash;the &s;tately, and the depre&s;&s;ed&mdash; the healthy, and the infirm. The order of nature is thus pre&s;erved in the world; and the beauty of nature is thus pre&s;erved in the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>A gentleman once con&s;ulted his friend, who pretended to a degree of ta&s;te, about the propriety of cutting down &s;ome trees, which &s;haded a winding avenue to his back-front, where his offices were placed. His friend advi&s;ed him by all means to leave them untouched. They are beautiful, &s;aid he, in them&s;elves; and, you &s;ee, they &s;kreen that part of your hou&s;e, which you would wi&s;h to have &s;kreened. The gentleman &s;eemed convinced, and the next time he met his friend, I have taken your advice, &s;aid he, and have left the trees &s;tanding. And &s;o indeed he had; but all the &s;tunted wood, and under-growth, which he con&s;idered as offen&s;ive rubbi&s;h, he had rooted up; over-looking their u&s;e in compo&s;ition. The con|&s;equence was, he laid all the offen&s;ive part of his hou&s;e open; let in the light, and intirely de&s;troyed the &s;cene.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="78">In the fir&s;t book I mentioned the different effects of &s;oil, and climate on trees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See v. i. page 25.</NOTE>. In New-fore&s;t the&s;e ob&s;ervations are well illu&s;|trated. The oaks there &s;eem to have a cha|racter peculiar to them&s;elves. They are the mo&s;t picture&s;que trees of the kind, we meet with. They &s;eldom ri&s;e into lofty &s;tems, as oaks u&s;ually do in richer &s;oils: but their branches, which are more adapted to what the &s;hip-builders call <HI>knees</HI> and <HI>elbows</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See ibid.</NOTE>, are commonly twi&s;ted into the mo&s;t picture&s;que forms. In general I believe, the poorer the &s;oil, the more picture&s;que the tree&mdash;that is, it forms a more beautiful ramification.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the New-fore&s;t oak is not &s;o much loaded with foliage, as the trees of richer &s;oils. An over-loaded foliage de&s;troys all form. On the other hand, when the leaf is too thinly &s;cattered, the tree looks blighted, &s;hrivelled, and meagre. The point of pic|ture&s;que perfection is when the tree has foliage enough to form a ma&s;s; and yet not &s;o
<PB N="74" REF="79">
much as to hide the branches. One of the great ornaments of a tree, is it's ramification, which ought to appear, here and there, un|der the foliage, even when it is in full leaf. It is the want of this &s;pecies of ramifi|cation, which gives a heavine&s;s to the beech<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See v. I, page 44.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The great avenue from Brokenhur&s;t leads through the &s;pace of five or &s;ix miles. After we have mounted the &s;ummit of the hill, the clo&s;e views in the de&s;cent on the other &s;ide, are very beautiful, con&s;i&s;ting of little woody rece&s;&s;es, open groves, or open glades, varied as they were before, in different forms.</P>
<P>As we approach Lyndhur&s;t, we pa&s;s Foxlees on the left. The &s;ituation here is ju&s;t the rever&s;e of Mr. Morant's. The one &s;tands high, and commands the fore&s;t at a di&s;tance; the other, in a bottom, is &s;urrounded by
<PB N="75" REF="80">
it. Both modes of &s;ituation have their beauty; but an exten&s;ive fore&s;t-view before the hou&s;e, with a few noble trees on the fore-ground, is not only, at all times, a better picture; but it is al&s;o more agreeably varied by the occa&s;ional incidents of light and weather, of which the other is not capable.</P>
<P>In a part of the &s;kreen, which divides the&s;e grounds from the road, we have an opportunity of remarking the di&s;agreeable effect of trees planted alternately. The eye is di&s;gu&s;ted with looking fir&s;t on a fir, &s;econdly on an elm; thirdly on a fir; fourthly on an elm again, and &s;o on. And yet this tire|&s;ome monotony, under the name of variety, is one of the commone&s;t modes of planting. In planting, we &s;hould certainly <HI>endeavour</HI> at lea&s;t to plant like nature, which gives us the be&s;t criterion of beauty. This alter|nacy is a direct, and &s;tudied oppo&s;ition to all her plea&s;ing forms of compo&s;ition. It not only &s;hews the hand of art; but of the mo&s;t ta&s;tle&s;s art. How much more beautiful would &s;uch a &s;kreen appear, made up of different kinds of trees in ma&s;&s;es of each; or in an indi&s;criminate mixture of all together?</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="81">The town of Lyndhur&s;t makes a picture&s;que appearance, as we approach it; but in&s;tead of entering it, we left it on the right; and turned abruptly into the road to Min&s;ted. The ground here is much varied. It is hilly, broken, and wooded in clumps; with cot|tages here and there, inter&s;per&s;ed. Nothing in the pa&s;toral &s;tile can be more picture&s;que. &mdash;We have al&s;o exten&s;ive views through the woods; particularly a grand retro&s;pect towards Southampton. But as we approach Min&s;ted, the woods fail: all becomes cul|tivation; and the idea of a fore&s;t is in a great degree lo&s;t. Soon after we enter the we&s;tern road to Ringwood, over a &s;pacious heath.</P>
<P>At the eighty-&s;econd &s;tone, about a quarter of a mile down the hill on the right from the road, we are &s;hewn the &s;cene of the celebrated event of Rufus's death.

&s;uppo&s;ing it might be admitted, as evidence in identifying the place. The <HI>&s;cene</HI> al&s;o in &s;ome degree bears the &s;ame te&s;timony. For hi&s;tory informs us, the diver&s;ion of the day was now over, the &s;un was declining, and William, di&s;mounting his hor&s;e, was enjoying a moment's re&s;t after the fatigue of the chace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See William of Malm&s;b. and Henry of Huntingdon.</NOTE>, when a &s;tag darted &s;uddenly acro&s;s the heath. The king turning towards it, and lifting his hand to &s;kreen his eyes from the &s;un<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See an account, which Rapin gives in a note from Sir John Haywood.</NOTE>, at that moment received the arrow. The &s;cene is a &s;weet &s;eque&s;tred bottom, open to the we&s;t, where the corner of a heath &s;inks gently into it; but &s;heltered on the ea&s;t by a beechen grove, and on every other &s;ide by clumps of trees, forming an irregular &s;kreen around it; among which are &s;everal winding avenues of green&s;ward.&mdash;It is the very place, where a per&s;on heated with toil, might be allured to &s;top for a moment's repo&s;e. But the chief circum&s;tance of evidence is, that as the place is open only to the we&s;t, where the heath
<PB N="78" REF="83">
was never probably covered with wood, the king could there only have been incommoded by an evening-&s;un.</P>
<P>Having taken a view of this &s;cene, which in it&s;elf, unconnected with the hi&s;tory it records, is a plea&s;ing one, we a&s;cended again into the great road, and pur&s;ued the heath, over which it led.&mdash;It is a wild expan&s;e, unadorned with wood; but bounded on every &s;ide, by very exten&s;ive di&s;tances. In front you di&s;cover the high grounds of the i&s;le of Purbeck. On the left, you have a large range over the i&s;le of Wight. In the retro|&s;pect you over-look the bay, and town of Southampton; and on the right is &s;pread before you a va&s;t &s;tretch of di&s;tant country, bounded by the hills of Wilt&s;hire, and Dor|&s;et&s;hire. This la&s;t is the only part of the&s;e di&s;tances, which hath any picture&s;que value. About the eighty-&s;ixth &s;tone, the parts of it are be&s;t di&s;po&s;ed; but it is the riche&s;t about the eighty-ninth, where it is &s;een over a woody bottom, which makes a middle ground.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="84">In this part of the fore&s;t the paling of one of the new inclo&s;ures to &s;ecure timber, which ran a con&s;iderable way in a &s;trait line, deformed our views. Sometimes indeed the paling of parks, and fore&s;ts is picture&s;que, where it runs winding round a hill, and appears again perhaps in &s;ome oppo&s;ite direction; but in general, it is an unplea&s;ing object; and what in adorned &s;cenery we &s;hould wi&s;h to hide. Indeed all divi&s;ions of property are great nui&s;ances to the picture&s;que eye, which loves to range at large; and it adds peculiar beauty to the fore&s;t, that in general the grand lines of nature, and various &s;welling of the ground, are unbroken by the&s;e intru&s;ions, and have their full play, and undulation. In remote di&s;tances, hedge-rows, pales, and other objects, offen|&s;ive on the &s;pot, become one rich blended &s;urface.&mdash;And yet, even on the &s;pot, winding lanes, with full-grown hedges on each &s;ide, are often beautiful. It is <HI>clipping,</HI> and <HI>making,</HI> as they phra&s;e it, which ruin the picture&s;que idea. Utility is always counteracting beauty.

No &s;ooner is the hedge in perfection, than it is de&s;troyed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the reader wi&s;h to know an ancient mode of making hedges, he will find it, as follows, in the fifth book of Q. Curtius. "Having planted twigs very clo&s;e in the &s;ituation they wi&s;hed, they bent their branches, as they made &s;hoots, and in&s;erted their extremities into the earth. Here they took root; and from the&s;e roots &s;hot into new branches.

<P>The approach to Ringwood, as we leave the wild heath, which gave occa&s;ion to this digre&s;&s;ion, is woody and plea&s;ant.&mdash;Ring|wood was formerly the boundary of the fore&s;t in this part; and in times of &s;till more remote antiquity, was a place of great note. I know not whether in Saxon times, it did not claim the honours of regal re&s;idence. At pre&s;ent it is a cheerful village, &s;eated in a flat country, on the banks of the Avon, which &s;preads, near the town, into a large piece of water, full of little i&s;lands, and frequented by &s;wans.</P>

But I think the account more probable, that he was taken near Woodlands in Dor&s;et&s;hire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hutching's hi&s;t. of Dor&s;et, p. 60 and 499.</NOTE>.

<P><PB N="82" REF="87">From Ringwood to Chri&s;t-church the country is flat, and the lanes clo&s;e, and woody. Scarce any di&s;tant view is admitted, except here and there, among the meadows on the right.

<P>As we leave the village of Sopley, the meadows on the right, form a better land&s;cape, than we had yet had. The parts are large, tho flat; and the whole is bounded with wood; in which the tower of Chri&s;t-church appears as a principal object. The church, to which it belongs, was formerly mona&s;tic. It is a grand pile, partly Saxon, and partly Gothic. Some of it's Gothic members are beautiful; particularly a &s;mall chapel, near the altar, dedicated to the virgin Mary; which for proportion and beauty of workman&s;hip, is a very elegant piece of Gothic architecture. The church is now parochial.</P>
<P>The town of Chri&s;t-church, which takes it's name from the church, is a place of great antiquity. Here we find the ruins of a ca&s;tle,
<PB N="83" REF="88">
which was intended formerly to &s;ecure the mouth of the Avon. This river is joined by the Stour below the town; where uniting in a full &s;tream, they wind together through a bleak coa&s;t, forming it fir&s;t into large flat meadows, and then opening into a bay before they enter the &s;ea. The view, which is not very intere&s;ting, is bounded by a ridge of high lands, called Chri&s;t-church head, on the right; and on the left, by the we&s;tern end of the i&s;le of Wight, which in this part, makes a remarkable appearance. It is &s;een nearly in front; and it's broken cliffs, when the noon-tide &s;un in winter &s;hines &s;trongly upon it, appear like the ends of two frac|tured walls, with a dark cavity between them.</P>
<P>From Chri&s;t-church to Lymington the country continues flat, cultivated, and inclo&s;ed. Scarce an object pre&s;ents it&s;elf. A little to the right of the road, you &s;ee a large hou&s;e built by lord Bute for the benefit of the &s;ea-air. It &s;tands on a cliff directly oppo&s;ite to Cher|burgh, from which it is about &s;ixty miles di&s;tant; and it overlooks the &s;ea, ju&s;t in that point, where Chri&s;t-church head, and the
<PB N="84" REF="89">
we&s;tern promontory of the i&s;le of Wight, form an immen&s;e colonade before it.</P>
<P>The road to the hou&s;e runs directly to the front, narrow, and contracted at the entrance, but opening by degrees. The hou&s;e fir&s;t appears; then the extent of the lawn; which is ample, with a pavilion at each extremity. The&s;e from the &s;ea appear to connect it with the hou&s;e; and give it con&s;equence. Beyond the lawn, the grand colonade ju&s;t mentioned, extends; and beyond all, the expan&s;e of the ocean. There is &s;omething very amu&s;ing in thus contemplating an idea, which is conti|nually dilating, and opening it&s;elf from a narrow tunnel into infinite &s;pace. If it were the effect of chance, or nece&s;&s;ity, we have only to admire the happine&s;s of it.</P>
<P>The cliff, on which the hou&s;e &s;tands, is about fifty, or &s;ixty yards high. It is not perpendicular, but the ground being of a &s;pongy, foundering nature, is continually falling in huge ma&s;&s;es; and affords an ea&s;y foundation for winding &s;tairs among the heaps of ruin, which occupy the &s;lope. At the bottom you are received by a clean, &s;andy beach, where, at the ebb of the tide, you may continue your walk many miles.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="90">The hou&s;e is a &s;umptuous pile; and contains much curio&s;ity: but as I am in que&s;t only of &s;cenery, my &s;ubject forbids me to enter hou&s;es. Lord Bute has made an attempt to adorn the cliff around him with a plantation. But if it &s;hould not thrive, I think the lo&s;s not great. Trees, in &s;o expo&s;ed a &s;ituation, may perhaps ju&s;t get hold of the ground: but I &s;hould think it impo&s;&s;ible for them to produce either &s;helter, or ornament. Indeed in views of this kind, I have my doubts, whether the rural idea &s;hould not <HI>purpo&s;ely</HI> be excluded, as inter|fering with the native grandeur of the &s;cene. Flowers, and flowering &s;hrubs at lea&s;t &s;eem to be alien beauties.</P>
<P>As we leave lord Bute's, the country &s;till continues flat, cultivated, and inclo&s;ed. Scarce a &s;ingle opening pre&s;ents it&s;elf. We ob&s;erved however one &s;pecies of land&s;cape, which in &s;o flat a &s;urface, is &s;ingular&mdash;tho&s;e hollows, or dells mentioned in the general view of the fore&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 52.</NOTE>, running acro&s;s it to the &s;ea.

<PB N="86" REF="91">
mo&s;t remarable are tho&s;e of Chuton, A&s;hley, and Effort. In each of the&s;e there is a little rivulet, which the traveller, ignorant of the country, will &s;ometimes be &s;urprized to &s;ee &s;woln to an extraordinary &s;ize, without any ap|parent cau&s;e. The ca&s;e is, they communicate with the &s;ea, at a very little di&s;tance; but being totally &s;creened from it, and &s;heltered by wood on every &s;ide, they have the appear|ance of inland brooks, tho in fact they are under the influence of a tide.</P>
<P>The cliff, on which lord Bute's hou&s;e &s;tands, runs two, or three miles along the coa&s;t towards Lymington; and is known by the name of Hordwell cliff. The &s;ummit of it is a fine carpet down, and is much fre|quented in the &s;ummer-&s;ea&s;on, by company from Lymington, for the &s;ake of &s;ea-air, and &s;ea-views. The &s;ides of this cliff, as was ob&s;erved, frequently fall in, and after one of the&s;e <HI>founders,</HI> as they are called, the ma&s;&s;es of ruin form a bold, rough bank, again&s;t the &s;ea, which &s;ecures the coa&s;t from another founder, till that body of earth is wa&s;hed away, and the land-&s;prings have loo&s;ened the earth above, when the cliff again falls in. Within the&s;e
<PB N="87" REF="92">
la&s;t twenty years the &s;ea has gained near a quarter of a mile, in &s;ome places on this coa&s;t, and the calculators of the country &s;ay, that lord Bute's hou&s;e cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;tand above thirty years. He has taken however great pains to &s;ecure it, by diverting, at a great expence, the land-&s;prings: &s;o that he has little to fear but the action of the &s;ea, which, tho a rough enemy, is a much le&s;s dangerous one; and again&s;t this he has endeavoured to guard by facing the precipice in different parts with &s;tone.</P>
<P>In this cliff between Chri&s;t-church and Lymington, is found a great variety of fo&s;&s;il &s;hells. About a hundred and twenty different &s;orts were collected by Mr. Gu&s;tavus Brander, of Chri&s;t-church, and pre&s;ented to the Briti&s;h mu&s;eum. Mr. Brander publi&s;hed al&s;o in 1766, de&s;criptions, and very neat engravings of them, under the title of <HI>Fo&s;&s;ilia Hanto|nien&s;ia.</HI> The&s;e &s;hells are found about fourteen or fifteen feet below the &s;urface. The &s;tratum above them is &s;and and gravel. The &s;oil, in which they are found, is a blui&s;h clay; and runs down from the gravelly &s;tratum, to a level with the &s;ea; and probably much deeper. In every part of this cliff the&s;e
<PB N="88" REF="93">
&s;hells are found; but chiefly about the vil|lage of Hordwell. It is difficult to get them: the collector mu&s;t clamber up the &s;ides of the precipice; and then extricate them from the clay, which is very &s;tiff, by a tool. Their texture too is &s;o brittle, that in clean&s;ing them he runs a great ri&s;que of breaking them.&mdash;What is remarkable, few of the&s;e &s;hells belong to this coa&s;t, or indeed to any European coa&s;t; and many of them as far as is known, are found no where el&s;e. It is remarkable al&s;o, that this &s;tratum of &s;hells runs in a northerly direction quite through New-fore&s;t. Wherever the earth is opened to any depth, in digging marle, or on other occa&s;ions, &s;hells are found; tho I never &s;aw them of any &s;ize; except upon the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>A little below Hordwell, the cliff fails, and the coa&s;t becoming flat between this place and Lymington, is commodiou&s;ly formed into &s;alterns; where great quantities of ex|cellent &s;alt have been made; tho the trade has of late fallen off. The &s;quare, bounded receptacles to receive the brine, are a glaring injury to the beauty of the &s;hore.</P>

<P><PB N="89" REF="95">About two or three miles farther along the coa&s;t, &s;tands Hur&s;t-ca&s;tle, built at the point of an extraordinary natural cau&s;eway, which runs two miles into the &s;ea; forming a narrow channel, between the ca&s;tle, and the i&s;le of Wight. The cau&s;eway it&s;elf al&s;o is &s;o narrow, that it &s;carce, at high water, exceeds two hundred yards in breadth. In high tides it is much narrower. The whole is covered with loo&s;e pebbles. The &s;ide towards the i&s;land is a bold &s;hore; beaten into ledges, or terraces of pebbles, by the violence of the waves. The other &s;ide, which is &s;heltered, is undulating, mar&s;hy, and un|determined; forming the water, when the tide flows, into a &s;mooth land-locked bay.</P>
<P>From this little penin&s;ula you are enter|tained with views on each hand. The i&s;land, and the Needle-rocks are objects, dreary, va&s;t, and grand; and not wholly unpicture&s;que. But to make them objects of the pencil, they mu&s;t be well inlightened, and the fore|ground adorned with a little naval furniture &mdash;an anchor, a net hanging to dry, a drifted
<PB N="90" REF="96">
boat, or &s;ome other object, with which &s;ea-coa&s;ts abound. When I fir&s;t &s;aw this &s;cene, it was in a &s;ultry &s;ummer-noon, and all the cliffs were over&s;pread with that dingy in|di&s;tinct hue, which &s;ometimes accompanies a hot meridian &s;un. The &s;ea, which was calm, was lighter than the land, tho darker than the &s;ky.&mdash;But in the evening, the white cliff at the end of the i&s;land, together with the Needles, were tinged with the &s;et|ting &s;un, and became very &s;plendid; and the &s;ea glowing with equal radiance, the whole view, and every part of it, was rich and harmonious.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of the penin&s;ula, the Hamp&s;hire coa&s;t, extending far and wide, forms an immen&s;e bay, which appears flat, woody, and inter&s;per&s;ed with a variety of di&s;tant objects. The parts are here, and there, picture&s;que; but the whole, tho amu&s;ing, is too va&s;t for the pencil.</P>
<P>Hur&s;t-ca&s;tle lying level with the beech, fully commands the channel, which &s;eparates the coa&s;t of Hamp&s;hire from the i&s;le of Wight. It con&s;i&s;ts of a round tower forti|fied by &s;emi-circular ba&s;tions; and was among the &s;tronge&s;t of tho&s;e ca&s;tles, which were

built by Henry VIII. But &s;ince Port&s;|mouth hath been a place of con&s;equence, and always guarded by a fleet, this ca&s;tle, as well as others of the &s;ame intention, are now neglected.&mdash;In this ca&s;tle the apart|ments are &s;till &s;hewn, where Charles I was confined, when he was carried from the i&s;le of Wight; and very mi&s;erable they are. &mdash;On the batteries we &s;aw an in&s;tance of Hogarth's humour, when he was painter to the ordinance.

<P>The Needles, which are of the &s;ame tex|ture of rock with the neighbouring cliffs of the i&s;land, &s;eem to have been wa&s;hed from them by the &s;ea. A gradual change has been ob&s;erved, even in the memory of man. We may ea&s;ily imagine with what violence a &s;torm at &s;ea pours in among the&s;e piles of formidable rocks, when the &s;uction and

eddies of tides and currents make them dan|gerous almo&s;t in the &s;erene&s;t weather.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the curious &s;ituation of Hur&s;t-ca&s;tle, there is another peculiarity on this coa&s;t, which de&s;erves notice. It is an i&s;land called the <HI>Shingles,</HI> which &s;ometimes ri&s;es fifteen or twenty feet above the water; and at other times totally di&s;appears. It &s;hifts it's &s;ituation al&s;o, rearing it&s;elf, at one time, nearer the i&s;le of Wight, and at another, nearer the coa&s;t of Hamp&s;hire. The my&s;tery of it is this. In that part of the channel lies a va&s;t bank of pebbles, &s;o near the &s;urface, that it is beaten up into an i&s;land, by the raging of the &s;ea, &s;ometimes on one &s;ide, and &s;ometimes on the other, as the tides and currents drive. From the &s;ame cau&s;es too, all the prominent parts of it are as ea&s;ily di&s;per&s;ed, and the i&s;land vani&s;hes. When we &s;aw it, it con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal acres: but it was then larger, than had been remem|bered for many years. The &s;ea however had found a pa&s;&s;age through the middle of it; and it was le&s;&s;ening daily.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="99">But as the country from Chri&s;t-church is flat, and the &s;ea generally excluded from the fight, all the&s;e views of the i&s;le of Wight, the Needles, and Hur&s;t-ca&s;tle mu&s;t be ob|tained by leaving the road, and getting a little nearer the coa&s;t. Other intere&s;ting views may be &s;ought in the &s;ame way, both on the right, and left of the road. At Milford, and in the neighbourhood of it, are &s;everal good views of the&s;e great objects. At Rook-cliff, a little nearer the &s;ea, the views are again varied; the i&s;land, and coa&s;t forming the appearance of an ample bay. On the other &s;ide of the road, about Pennington-common, from Mr. Dixon's, and other places, the di&s;tant views make a new ap|pearance, ju&s;t &s;kirting the horizon, over a flat country, with a long &s;weep of the i&s;land, and intervening channel. But the mo&s;t beau|tiful view, on this &s;ide, is from Mr. Etty's drawing-room at Prie&s;tlands. The near grounds &s;ink in the middle into a &s;ort of wide valley, which is occupied in the di&s;tance by the i&s;land, and the channel: and as they retire from the eye on the left, and wind rather towards it on the right, the whole has the appearance of a grand lake; bounded

As the hou&s;e &s;tands in the centre of this view, it appears as if the hou&s;e, and view had been adapted to each other; which is one of the happie&s;t circum|&s;tances, that can attend a &s;ituation. A fine view is plea&s;ing; but a fine view adapted to the &s;ituation of a hou&s;e, is more &s;o.&mdash; They who are unacquainted with the country, &s;hould be apprized, that in all the&s;e views, and wherever the i&s;land is &s;een from the Hamp|&s;hire coa&s;t, it's in&s;ularity is no where di&s;|coverable.

<P>A little farther to the ea&s;t &s;tands Lyming|ton, ju&s;t at the point, where the flat country we had been travelling from Chri&s;t-church, de&s;cends to the river, which takes it's name from the town. The brow, and gentle de&s;cent of this falling ground the town oc|cupies; forming one hand&s;ome &s;treet, which overlooks the high grounds on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river.

<P>Acro&s;s the e&s;tuary, formed at the mouth of Lymington-river, a dam with flood-gates is thrown. The intention was, to exclude the &s;alt-water from the meadows above; which, it was hoped, might have become good pa&s;turage: but the purpo&s;e is not an&s;wered. A great beauty however ari&s;es from the influx of the tide, which forms a hand&s;ome piece of water above the dam, with many reaches, and winding &s;hores. We have already ob|&s;erved the beauty of this e&s;tuary; when &s;een from the higher grounds, as it enters the &s;ea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 61.</NOTE>.

The port of Lymington particularly, which is entered by a long, narrow, &s;hallow river, is chiefly frequented by light &s;kiffs, rigged in the cutter-form, with a jib and boom. The&s;e are, of all others, the mo&s;t beautiful ve&s;&s;els, which frequent a coa&s;t. To make a large &s;hip a beautiful object, &s;ome peculiar incident is ne|ce&s;&s;ary.

A degree of di&s;tance al&s;o is requi&s;ite, both to le&s;&s;en the object; and to &s;often the features of it.&mdash;But the light &s;kiff, with a &s;ingle ma&s;t, a jib, and boom, is beautiful almo&s;t in any po&s;ition. As &s;he is often undecked, the lines of her &s;ides are generally well contra&s;ted; and the various turns, and &s;wellings of her &s;ails almo&s;t always pre&s;ent &s;ome elegant form.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els great numbers frequent the channel, between the i&s;le of Wight, and the coa&s;t of Hamp&s;hire. And what adds to the animation of the &s;cene, the river forms two

A &s;mall harbour therefore is much more productive of picture&s;que objects, than one of larger &s;ize, frequented either by &s;hips of war, or of burthen. A &s;cene, like this, gave occa&s;ion to tho&s;e very beautiful lines in Shake&s;pear.</P>

<P>On the we&s;tern &s;ide, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to Vicar's-hill, are the ruins of a Roman-camp,
<PB N="98" REF="104">
which the country people know by the name of <HI>Buckland-ring,</HI> tho in fact it is <HI>rectangular.</HI> It gives no value to the &s;cene; but if your curio&s;ity lead you to it, you will find it a very complete work of the kind. There are many larger in England; but few more perfect. It mea&s;ures in length about two hundred paces; in breadth not quite &s;o much; and hath been defended by two ramparts, and two ditches. The whole of the&s;e works is intire, except the front to|wards the river, which is demoli&s;hed: but in the demolition you may trace the double ditches. The ramparts &s;eem to have been about twenty feet high. In the front, the view is very exten&s;ive over the channel, and all the environs of the river. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide the eye is carried far and wide, into the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>Below the camp, runs a creek from the river, where it is &s;uppo&s;ed the Romans u&s;ed to land; and works have been thrown up there al&s;o with a view, no doubt, to &s;ecure their landing.

<P>Remarks on the we&s;tern parts of New-fore&s;t, in a ride from Vicar's-hill, to Wilverly-lodge&mdash;Burley-lodge &mdash;Boldrewood-lodge&mdash;Rhinfield-lodge&mdash;Setley-wood &mdash;Burnt hill, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING thus taken a large circuit, of near fifty miles, round the we&s;tern parts of the fore&s;t; I &s;hall now conduct my reader through the &s;ame country again, <HI>in|teriore gyro.</HI> The internal parts of this ex|ten&s;ive circle are &s;uppo&s;ed to contain &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenery of it's kind in the fore&s;t. But as we had here no turn-pike-road to guide us, and a great variety of paths to mi&s;lead us, we were obliged to put our&s;elves on hor&s;e-back under the conduct of one of the under-keepers.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="107">In&s;tead of holding the great road, as before from Battram&s;ley to Brokenhur&s;t, we turned &s;hort, to the left, into the open part of the fore&s;t, towards a noted land-mark, called Marl-pit-oak; well known to the deer-&s;tealer; who on this, or &s;ome neighbouring tree, often takes his &s;tand, in the du&s;k of a &s;ummer-evening, to watch the herd, as it leaves the woods to graze the&s;e open grounds.</P>
<P>This wild heath receives &s;ome beauty from it's &s;welling in various parts. The &s;wells are bold, but at the &s;ame time ea&s;y: the ground, &s;eldom broken, generally falls gently into little valleys.&mdash;The&s;e beauties however are obvious only to the picture&s;que eye, which by a little imaginary fini&s;hing can form the&s;e rough ground-plots into pictures.&mdash;As we attained the higher part of the heath, we had better land&s;cape. We had been mounting gradually from the great road through two or three miles, when the country giving way on <HI>the right,</HI> a grand di&s;play of woody-&s;cenery was opened towards Brokenhur&s;t, and Lynd|hur&s;t. On <HI>the left,</HI> the heath is but meagerly &s;kirted with wood. To make amends how|ever,
<PB N="103" REF="108">
the cliffs of the i&s;le of Wight range beyond it in the di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Scattered about the&s;e wild grounds we meet with many tumuli. Between Shirley-holms, and Setley-wood, are four or five. Two of them are rai&s;ed in contiguous circles, which is a circum&s;tance rather uncommon. It &s;eems to indicate, that the per&s;ons, to who&s;e memory they were con&s;tructed, had been nearly connected. On pacing the cir|cumference of each, we find they have be|longed to per&s;ons of unequal dignity, in the proportion of a hundred and eight, to eighty three. But a little to the ea&s;t of Shirly-holms, near Peatmer-pond, ari&s;es a larger tumulus than either of the&s;e, called Shirley-barrow. It's circumference is one hundred and forty paces.&mdash;There are many other tumuli, on the great heaths of the fore&s;t; which I mention here, as I &s;hall take no farther notice of them.</P>
<P>As we de&s;cended the gentle heights, on which we were now rai&s;ed, a beautiful valley,
<PB N="104" REF="109">
about a quarter of a mile in breadth, opened before us, arrayed in vivid green, and winding two or three miles round a wood. On the other &s;ide the grounds, wild, and unadorned, fall with an ea&s;y &s;weep into it. Beyond the&s;e a grand woody &s;cene &s;preads, far, and wide, into di&s;tance; and as it approaches the eye, unites gently with the other parts of the land&s;cape. The valley was no other than that va&s;t bog, already mentioned, known by the name of <HI>Long&s;lade-bottom</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of it, page 56.</NOTE>. It's de|ceitful &s;urface however does no injury to it's picture&s;que form: only indeed it deprives it of the appendages of grazing cattle. The nimble deer trip over it in &s;ummer without inconvenience; but no animals of heavier bulk dare tru&s;t them&s;elves upon it.&mdash;The name of the wood beyond this verdant valley, is Hinchel&s;ea.</P>
<P>As we leave Long&s;lade-bottom on the right, the grounds, which ri&s;e on the left, are occupied by Sethorn-wood, a &s;cene of con|&s;iderable extent. Sethorn-wood was once the
<PB N="105" REF="110">
noble&s;t of all fore&s;t-&s;cenes. The ground it &s;tood on is beautifully varied; and the gran|deur, and number of it's oaks were the admiration of all, who &s;aw them. But it's glories are now over. During the unremitted cour&s;e of thirty years it continued to add &s;trength to the fleets of Britain; it&s;elf &s;uf|ficient to rai&s;e a navy. In this arduous &s;ervice, it's vigour was at length exhau&s;ted; and it contains little more, at pre&s;ent, than &s;hrubs, and underwood, and bla&s;ted trees. In the mid&s;t of this wood ri&s;es a hill called <HI>Oak-brow,</HI> from the &s;tately oaks, which once adorned it's &s;ummit, and &s;haggy &s;ides. But it's honours fell a &s;acrifice, not, like tho&s;e of Sethorn, to it's country's good, but to the convenience of a potent neighbour. Through the influence of lord Delawar, who&s;e views it ob&s;tructed, it's oaks were felled, long before any inroads had been made among the woods, which incircled them. And if the de&s;truction of the&s;e oaks had been partial; if a few, here and there, had been left as a fore-ground, the injury, on the &s;pot at lea&s;t, might the le&s;s be re|gretted. For the views which are thus opened from it's brow, make great amends for the lo&s;s
<PB N="106" REF="111">
of it's woods. They con&s;i&s;t chiefly of two or three beautiful lawns, &s;kreened with fore&s;t-&s;cenery. <HI>Yew-tree-bottom</HI> denotes one of the&s;e &s;cenes; and <HI>Even-water-bottom,</HI> another. The former receives it's name from the &s;pecies of trees, which decorate it; the latter, from a pool, which occupies it's middle area.</P>
<P>In fore&s;t language, vallies in general are called bottoms; tho in fact, they are wide extended &s;cenes. Mo&s;t of them have their little rivulets running through them. But the&s;e fore&s;t-&s;treams are very unlike the &s;treams of a mountainous country; pouring among rocks, and fretting among pebbles. Theirs is a tamer nature. They are &s;eldom more than little ouzing rills, which drain the &s;pringy &s;ides of ri&s;ing grounds; and wander &s;lowly, unob&s;erved, and unob&s;tructed, through the vallies of the fore&s;t. The land&s;cape however, &s;eldom wants their paltry a&s;&s;i&s;|tance. The only way, in which the&s;e rivulets are of any u&s;e in a fore&s;t-&s;cene, is, when they &s;pread them&s;elves into little pools, in &s;ome part of the valley, as they do here, in Even-water-bottom, and as they frequently do in other &s;cenes; and the merit of the&s;e
<PB N="107" REF="112">
little pieces of water chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in draw|ing all the cattle of the neighbourhood around their banks, which greatly animate, and in|rich the view.</P>
<P>In this part of the fore&s;t &s;tands Wilverly-lodge commanding beautiful views of the&s;e &s;weet wooded lawns, and vallies; which, from the high &s;ituation of the lodge, are &s;et off with the i&s;le of Wight, as a back-ground.</P>
<P>From Wilverly, we traver&s;ed the pales of a new timber inclo&s;ure, which is not le&s;s than four miles in circumference. If the wood, which it is meant to defend, &s;hould ever flouri&s;h, it would &s;oon create a &s;cene. But at pre&s;ent this part of the fore&s;t is barren of beauty, and there is &s;o very little appear|ance of the growth of timber, that people are apt to &s;uppo&s;e, it has been ignorantly planted; or negligently attended.&mdash;One rea|&s;on indeed a&s;&s;igned for the ruin of the young wood, is the quantity of rabbits, which breed in the dry, &s;andy hills of the&s;e parts; and which it is difficult, amid&s;t &s;uch &s;helter, to extirpate. A young oak, ju&s;t vegetating from the acorn, is e&s;teemed, by the&s;e pernicious inmates, the mo&s;t delicious food. Thus it
<PB N="108" REF="113">
may be &s;aid, the glory of England may be nipped in the bud by a paltry rabbit.</P>
<P>After we leave the&s;e dreary pales, the country, here and there, breaks out towards Holm&s;ley-lodge; but nothing is very intere&s;t|ing till we arrive at the brow of Burley-hill. Here the eye is greatly regaled. From this height it &s;urveys a grand &s;weep of <HI>different removes</HI> of woody di&s;tance, &s;preading round a &s;emicircular plain of &s;everal miles in extent; known by the name of <HI>Mark-way-bottom.</HI> The plain it&s;elf con&s;i&s;ting of a well-propor|tioned intermixture of rich heath, and green pa&s;turage, is &s;omething between a fore&s;t-lawn, and a fore&s;t-heath; too large for the one, and yet not large enough for the other. In two or three different parts, it is adorned with tho&s;e attractive pools, which inrich a land&s;cape with the introduction of animal life.</P>
<P>The woods, which incircle this grand &s;avan|nah, as we &s;urvey them from the brow of the hill, are tho&s;e of Bury on the left: ad|joining to the&s;e, commence the woods of Burley; and &s;till more to the right, tho&s;e of Rhinfield. All this rich &s;cenery is in one continued, tho varied and broken, &s;weep; and ranges at different di&s;tances from one
<PB N="109" REF="114">
mile to ten. The woods of Bury on the left, being he neare&s;t, and mo&s;t elevated, intirely fill that part of the horizon, under which they &s;pread: but beyond tho&s;e of Burley ri&s;e, in fainter colouring, the two woody-bo&s;omed hills of Lyndhur&s;t; and beyond the woods of Rhinfield, a very remote fore&s;t-view &s;tretches into all the ob&s;curity of di&s;tance. Every &s;pecies of country, cultivated, as well as uncultivated, when melted down into di&s;|tance, has a fine effect; as we have often ob&s;erved; but the fore&s;t-di&s;tance, is among the riche&s;t.&mdash;Such is the grand view, from Burley-hill; continually varying it's appearance as we de&s;cend.</P>
<P>Our road led us over Mark-way-bottom, to the duke of Bolton's at Burley; which is an excellent fore&s;t-lodge, tho an ordinary ducal-&s;eat. The late duke having obtained a grant of it for thirty years, was at &s;ome ex|pence in adorning it. He built hand&s;ome &s;tables; fitted up the hou&s;e, and laid out a lawn before it, which is bounded by a piece of embanked water. There is but little ta&s;te however &s;hewn in the improvements; nor
<PB N="110" REF="115">
indeed does the &s;ituation de&s;erve much at|tention. It is low; and except that it &s;tands in the mid&s;t of a beautiful fore&s;t, it is on the whole, ill-cho&s;en.</P>
<P>The lawn of this lodge is adorned with &s;ome very grand oaks, which from the dignity of their form, and venerable appearance; as well as the number of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of them, have obtained the name of the <HI>twelve apo&s;tles.</HI></P>
<P>In the woods around this lodge, we &s;aw a breed of &s;mall cattle, which the late duke of Bolton procured from Scotland. While this herd was increa&s;ing, they were &s;uffered to run wild in the fore&s;t; but in a cour&s;e of years, when he wi&s;hed to reclaim a few of them, their habits were become &s;o ob&s;tinate, and their nature &s;o ferocious, that it was attempted without &s;ucce&s;s; and they are now among the <HI>ferae natur&acirc;</HI> of the fore&s;t. They are mi&s;chie|vous however only when attacked. We rode, and walked among them without any mole&s;|tation.</P>
<P>From Burley-lodge it is little more than two miles to Boldre-wood lodge, the &s;eat of
<PB N="111" REF="116">
lord Delawar. This hou&s;e enjoys one of the fine&s;t &s;ituations of the fore&s;t. It &s;tands high, with an exten&s;ive lawn before it, from which it commands a va&s;t extent of fore&s;t-&s;cenery, &s;pread around in great variety of di&s;tance; particularly towards Burley-lodge, where the woods &s;tretch far and wide, beyond a length|ened &s;avannah, which &s;ets them off to great advantage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame kind of &s;ituation, only varied, is de&s;cribed in page 63.</NOTE>.&mdash;On the other &s;ide of the lawn, the di&s;tances are woody; but more broken, and not &s;o remote.</P>
<P>Nor are the home-views around this beautiful &s;pot, le&s;s plea&s;ing, than tho&s;e at a di&s;tance. We wound near a mile round the lodge, through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of rich fore&s;t-&s;cenery, compo&s;ed chiefly of beech. The trees thme&s;elves are among the mo&s;t beautiful of their kind, having been &s;ecured from the ax by the protection of the hou&s;e they adorn. But &s;till the beech, even in perfection, is inferior to the oak, the elm, and the a&s;h, in mo&s;t of the characteri&s;tics of picture&s;que beauty. It has always too much of a &s;piry pointedne&s;s in the extremities of its branches; which gives a littlene&s;s to its parts. In its mo&s;t beautiful form it rarely &s;hakes off
<PB N="112" REF="117">
this characteri&s;tic imperfection. If the trees however as individuals, were le&s;s plea&s;ing, their combinations were highly beautiful; and exhibited much &s;cenery from tho&s;e natural openings, and glades, which are &s;o often found in the internal parts of fore&s;ts.</P>
<P>All the woods not only around this lodge, but in its neighbourhood, abound in beech. The ma&s;t of this tree is the mo&s;t fattening food for deer; and gives &s;uch repute to the winter-veni&s;on of Boldre-wood walk, that a &s;tranger would have difficulty in getting a king's warrant for a doe executed in it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Samber's MS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e woods al&s;o afford excellent feeding for hogs, which are led, in the autumn-&s;ea&s;on, into many parts of the fore&s;t, but e&s;pecially among the oaks, and beeches of Boldre-wood, to fatten on ma&s;t. It is among the rights of the fore&s;t-borderers to feed their hogs in the fore&s;t, during the <HI>pawnage-month,</HI> as it is called, which commences about the end of &s;eptember, and la&s;ts &s;ix weeks. For this
<PB N="113" REF="118">
privilege they pay a trifling acknowledgment at the &s;teward's court at Lyndhur&s;t. The word <HI>pawnage</HI> was the old term for the money thus collected<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Manwood on fore&s;t-law, p. 201.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The method of treating hogs at this &s;ea&s;on of migration, and of reducing a large herd of the&s;e unmanageable brutes to perfect obedience, and good government, is curious.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep the &s;wine-herd takes, is to inve&s;tigate &s;ome clo&s;e &s;heltered part of the fore&s;t, where there is a conveniency of water; and plenty of oak, or beech-ma&s;t, the former of which he prefers, when he can have it in &s;ufficient abundance<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pliny &s;eems to be of a different opinion. "Glans fagea &s;uem hilarem facit, carnem coquibilem, ac levem, et utilem &s;tomacho. Tradit Nigidius fungo&s;am carnem fieri e&s;culo, ro|bore, &s;ubere." Lib. xvi. 6.</NOTE>. He fixes next on &s;ome &s;preading tree, round the bole of which he wattles a &s;light, circular fence of the dimen&s;ions he wants; and covering it roughly with boughs, and &s;ods, he fills it plentifully with &s;traw, or fern.</P>
<P>Having made this preparation, he collects his colony among the farmers, with whom he commonly agrees for a &s;hilling a head,
<PB N="114" REF="119">
and will get together perhaps a herd of five or &s;ix hundred hogs. Having driven them to their de&s;tined habitation, he gives them a plentiful &s;upper of acorns, or beech-ma&s;t, which he had already provided, &s;ounding his horn; during the repa&s;t. He then turns them into the litter, where, after a long journey, and a hearty meal, they &s;leep de|liciou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The next morning he lets them look a little around them&mdash;&s;hews them the pool, or &s;tream, where they may occa&s;ionally drink &mdash;leaves them to pick up the offals of the la&s;t night's meal; and as evening draws on, gives them another plentiful repa&s;t under the neighbouring trees, which rain acorns upon them for an hour together, at the &s;ound of his horn. He then &s;ends them again to &s;leep.</P>
<P>The following day he is perhaps at the pains of procuring them another meal, with mu&s;ic playing as u&s;ual. He then leaves them a little more to them&s;elves, having an eye however on their evening-hours. But as their bellies are full, they &s;eldom wander far from home, retiring commonly very or|derly, and early to bed.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="120">After this, he throws his &s;ty open, and leaves them to cater for them&s;elves; and from hence-forward has little more trouble with them, during the whole time of their mi|gration. Now and then, in calm weather, when ma&s;t falls &s;paringly, he calls them perhaps together by the mu&s;ic of his horn to a gratuitous meal; but in general, they need little attention, returning regularly home at night, tho they often wander in the day two or three miles from their &s;ty. There are experienced leaders in all herds, which have &s;pent this roving life before; and can in&s;truct their juniors in the method of it. By this management the herd is carried home to their re&s;pective owners in &s;uch condition, that a little dry meat will &s;oon fatten them.</P>
<P>I would not however have it &s;uppo&s;ed, that all the &s;wine-herds in the fore&s;t manage their colonies with this exactne&s;s. Bad go|vernments, and bad governors will every where exi&s;t; but I mention this as an example of &s;ound policy&mdash;not as a mere Platonic, or Eutopian &s;cheme; but &s;uch as hath been often realized, and hath as often been found productive of good order, and public utility.
<PB N="116" REF="121">
The hog is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be an ob&s;tinate, head-&s;trong, unmanageable brute: and he may perhaps have a degree of po&s;i|tivene&s;s in his temper. In general, however if he be properly managed, he is an orderly, docile animal. The only difficulty is, to make your meanings, when they are fair, and friendly, intelligible to him. Effect this, and you may lead him with a &s;traw.</P>
<P>Nor is he without his &s;ocial feelings, when he is at liberty to indulge them. In the&s;e fore&s;t-migrations, it is commonly ob&s;erved, that of whatever number the herd con&s;i&s;ts, they generally &s;eparate, in their daily excur|&s;ions, into &s;uch little knots, and &s;ocieties, as have formerly had habits of intimacy together; and in the&s;e friendly groups they range the fore&s;t; returning home at night, in different parties, &s;ome earlier, and &s;ome later, as they have been more or le&s;s fortunate in the pur&s;uits of the day.</P>
<P>It &s;ounds oddly to affirm the life of a hog to be enviable; and yet there is &s;omething uncommonly plea&s;ing in the lives of the&s;e emigrants&mdash;&s;omething at lea&s;t more de&s;irable, than is to be found in the life of a hog <HI>Epicuri de grege.</HI> They &s;eem them&s;elves al&s;o,
<PB N="117" REF="122">
to enjoy their mode of life. You &s;ee them perfectly happy, going about at their ea&s;e, and conver&s;ing with each other in &s;hort, pithy, interrupted &s;entences, which are no doubt, expre&s;&s;ive of their own enjoyments, and of their &s;ocial feelings.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the hogs, thus led out in the ma&s;t-&s;ea&s;on to fatten, there are others, the property of fore&s;t-keepers, which &s;pend the whole year in &s;uch &s;ocieties. After the ma&s;t-&s;ea&s;on is over, the indigenous fore&s;t-hog depends chiefly for his livelihood on the roots of fern: and he would find this food very nouri&s;hing, if he could have it in abundance. But he is obliged to procure it by &s;o laborious an operation, that his meals are rarely ac|companied with &s;atiety. He continues how|ever, by great indu&s;try, to obtain a tolerable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence through the winter, except in fro&s;ty weather, when the ground re&s;i&s;ts his delving &s;nout: then he mu&s;t peri&s;h, if he do not in &s;ome degree experience his ma&s;ter's care. As &s;pring advances fre&s;h gra&s;&s;es, and &s;alads of different kinds, add a variety to his bill of fare; and as &s;ummer comes on, he finds juicy berries, and grateful &s;eeds, on
<PB N="118" REF="123">
which he lives plentifully, till autumn returns, and brings with it the extreme of abundance.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;tationary hogs, there are others in &s;ome of the more de&s;olate parts of the fore&s;t, which are bred wild, and left to them&s;elves, without any &s;ettled habitation.

<P>Charles I, I have heard, was at the ex|pence of procuring the wild boar and his mate from the fore&s;ts of Germany, which once certainly inhabited the fore&s;ts of England. I have heard too that they propagated greatly in New-fore&s;t. Certain it is, there is found in it, at this day, a breed of hogs, commonly called <HI>fore&s;t-pigs,</HI> which are very different from the u&s;ual Hamp&s;hire breed; and have about them &s;everal of the characteri&s;tic marks of the wild boar. The fore&s;t-hog has broad &s;houlders; a high cre&s;t; and thick, briftly mane, which he erects on any alarm. His hinder parts are light, and thin. His ears are &s;hort, and erect; and his colour either black, or darkly brindled. He is much fiercer, than the common breed; and will

<P>On leaving the beechen groves of Boldre-wood we were received by a large, open, &s;wampy, heath, called <HI>No Man's walk,</HI> being under the peculiar juri&s;diction of none of the keepers.&mdash;The woods &s;oon after commenced again, in which we pa&s;&s;ed a large fore&s;t-vi&s;ta, cut through them, from Lyndhur&s;t to Bur|ley-lodge; but it wanted the turnpike road which we found in the other vi&s;ta<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 65.</NOTE>. I could not have &s;uppo&s;ed how much it lo&s;t, from the want of this accompaniment. Without a <HI>road,</HI> there &s;eemed to be no <HI>rea&s;on</HI> for a
<PB N="120" REF="126">
vi&s;ta. In other re&s;pects al&s;o it wanted the variety of the Lyndhur&s;t-vi&s;ta.</P>
<P>Along the confines of the&s;e woods, we &s;kirted a fore&s;t-lawn, called <HI>Warwick&s;ted;</HI> which wheeled around us in the form of a cre&s;cent, near two miles in circuit. It was a beautiful &s;cene, hung with wood on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>Near this place &s;tands Rhinfield-lodge; the &s;ituation of which is perhaps as plea&s;ing, tho not &s;o grand, as that of Boldre-wood. It &s;tands on a &s;preading hill, incircled with groves of oak, among which indeed greater de&s;truction hath been made, for the &s;ake of the view, than &s;eems to have been nece&s;&s;ary. As the ground falls on every &s;ide from the hill, on which the hou&s;e &s;tands, &s;o on every &s;ide, it &s;oon begins to ri&s;e again, tho very gently, expanding by degrees into a va&s;t circle of fore&s;t-&s;cenery of every &s;pecies&mdash; exten&s;ive woods&mdash;&s;kirted heaths&mdash;intermixtures of wood and lawn&mdash;and all this land&s;cape exhibited through the various removes of di&s;tance. When we were &s;ated with the&s;e grand &s;cenes, we had them afterwards pre|&s;ented more picture&s;quely in parts, as we de&s;cended the hill, on which the lodge &s;tands.
<PB N="121" REF="127">
In this de&s;cent we caught them every where to great advantage, through the boles, and branches of the &s;tately oaks, which &s;urrounded us. As the ground, which immediately in|circled this hill at the bottom, is &s;wampy, and watered with rivulets, the &s;ituation is &s;ometimes in the winter, rather uncomfortable. When the rains are abundant, the waters &s;tagnate &s;o much around the hill, that it is almo&s;t completely in&s;ulated.</P>
<P>The next &s;cene we vi&s;ited was a fore&s;t-lawn of grand dimen&s;ions. It &s;eemed not le&s;s than nine or ten miles in circumference; bounded on every &s;ide, at lea&s;t in appearance, with woods, &s;ome of which were on a level with it, and others on grounds elevated above it. Among the&s;e latter were the woods of Brokenhur&s;t, adorned with the &s;pire of the church &s;hooting above them.&mdash;The pecu|liarity of this lawn is, that it's va&s;t area is a perfect flat&mdash;a form, which tho le&s;s beau|tiful than a playing &s;urface, exceeds it in &s;im|plicity, and grandeur. A <HI>&s;mall flat</HI> is trivial. It is a mere bowling-green. It has neither beauty in it's <HI>parts</HI> to &s;et it off; nor greatne&s;s
<PB N="122" REF="128">
in the <HI>whole,</HI> to make it intere&s;ting. A <HI>&s;mall piece of ground</HI> therefore &s;hould always be varied. But an <HI>exten&s;ive flat</HI> like this we are now examining, gives one grand, uniform idea, which fills the imagination. The grande&s;t idea of this kind, is that of the ocean; the greatne&s;s of which con&s;i&s;ts in it's being a continued flat. But the ocean pre&s;ents gran|deur without beauty. In a view of this kind at land, the idea of beauty is, more or le&s;s, impre&s;&s;ed by the character of the &s;cenery around it. I remember being exceedingly &s;truck with the grandeur of an immen&s;e &s;cene of this kind, on the borders of Scotland, called <HI>Brough-mar&s;h</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See ob&s;ervations on the lakes of Cumberland, &amp;c. vol. II. page 109.</NOTE>. It is infinitely larger indeed than this, and is invironed, not with woods, which would lo&s;e their effect round &s;o va&s;t an area; but with mountains. <HI>Rom|ney-mar&s;h</HI> in Kent, is a &s;cene al&s;o of the &s;ame kind; but it is cut in peices, and de|formed by parallel lines, hedges, and canals. Nor are it's boundaries good. In&s;tead of woods, or mountains, it is bounded by the
<PB N="123" REF="129">
&s;ea; and where the &s;ea appears in conjunc|tion with a level &s;urface, the effect is bad: it joins one flat to another, and produces confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The exten&s;ive fore&s;t-lawn, which gave oc|ca&s;ion to the&s;e remarks, is known by the name of <HI>Ober-green.</HI> It is chiefly pa&s;turage, patched here and there with heath; and is e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t feeding grounds, both for deer, and cattle in the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>Ober-green was the la&s;t of tho&s;e beautiful lawns, with which our ride through the&s;e parts of the fore&s;t was inlivened; and I imagine few counties in England could fur|ni&s;h &s;o many plea&s;ing woodland-&s;cenes in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s. He who delights in &s;uch &s;cenery will find it in much greater perfection in the wildne&s;s of a fore&s;t, than among the mo&s;t admired improvements of art. He will find it grander, more varied, and every where more replete with tho&s;e wild, inchanting pa&s;&s;ages, which the hand of art cannot give.

<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed this ob&s;truction, we ro&s;e Blackam&s;ley-hill, from whence, as in a table of contents, we had a view of all the country, the woods, and the lawns we had pa&s;&s;ed, extending at lea&s;t nine, or ten miles in length.</P>

<P>The two different kinds of hanging grounds, bounded with woods, which occa&s;ioned the&s;e remarks, occupied our left. In front was an extended &s;kirting of woody &s;cenery, which opening it&s;elf more and more, as we pro|ceeded, &s;pread into a noble &s;kreen. This

&s;cenery con&s;i&s;ted of tho&s;e va&s;t woods, which &s;tretch from Heathy-Dilton, to Boldre-church.</P>
<P>The&s;e woods hang over the mo&s;t plea&s;ing meadows about Roydon, and along all the valley to Brokenhur&s;t, that ever adorned a land&s;cape. It is a land&s;cape indeed of the cultured kind, and therefore little accommo|dated to the pencil; but of it's kind it is the mo&s;t lovely. Through this valley, con|&s;i&s;ting of hanging meadows, variou&s;ly bounded, and adorned with wood, the river of Lyming|ton, while it is yet rural, and only a fore&s;t-&s;tream, forms many a devious curve. But this plea&s;ing &s;cenery can only be traver&s;ed by the foot-pa&s;&s;enger, or the angler with his rod.

<P>Leaving the&s;e &s;cenes behind us, we entered the lanes of Roydon, broad, winding, and adorned in one part with an open grove, in others, with an intermixture of beech, and oak; which &s;tretching acro&s;s, form a canopy above the head. The&s;e lanes open upon a heath, called Sandy-down, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to enjoy the be&s;t air in it's neighbourhoood.

<P>DIRECTING our cour&s;e fir&s;t towards Beaulieu, we pa&s;&s;ed the plantations of &s;ir Harry Burrard at Walhampton, which extend round his hou&s;e, and are compo&s;ed chiefly of &s;ir.

<PB N="132" REF="137">
from &s;o lengthened a view of di&s;tant coa&s;t, is to break it, here and there, with plantations, &s;ometimes immediately on the fore-ground, and &s;ometimes in the &s;econd di&s;tance. And indeed in many parts of the gardens, where &s;uch portions are intercepted by the woods, good <HI>pictures</HI> are obtained.&mdash; After all however we mu&s;t allow, that nine per&s;ons in ten would be better plea&s;ed with the&s;e extended views in their pre&s;ent <HI>amu&s;ing &s;tate,</HI> than if they had been more generally broken in a form to plea&s;e the <HI>picture&s;que eye.</HI> Few people can di&s;tingui&s;h between the ideas of <HI>beautiful,</HI> and <HI>picture&s;que:</HI> but every eye is plea&s;ed with an <HI>amu&s;ing view.</HI></P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;heltered rece&s;&s;es, which extend even to my garden-gate, I am &s;o much in|debted, through the indulgence of their be|nevolent owner, for the quiet plea&s;ures of many a &s;tudious hour, that I &s;hould gladly enter more minutely into a de&s;cription of them; did not my &s;ubject, which holds me clo&s;ely to the wild &s;cenes of nature, forbid. Yet there is one &s;cene, which I cannot forbear mentioning: it is &s;o nearly allied to nature, that it is clo&s;ely allied al&s;o to to my &s;ubject. The &s;cene I mean, is a &s;mall lake, containing about a dozen acres, which
<PB N="133" REF="138">
has been formed out of a &s;wamp. It is wooded on both &s;ides; and the view of the whole together is very plea&s;ing, when you &s;tand in the open part, towards Portmere|common, from whence the head, which con|fines the water, is concealed; and the woods on each &s;ide, are united at the bottom, with tho&s;e of the garden. The walks, on both &s;ides, are well managed; and contain many little plea&s;ing rece&s;&s;es, and openings to the water.</P>
<P>Sir John D'Oyly, and Mr. Robbins, who&s;e hou&s;es we pa&s;s in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, have the &s;ame views towards the i&s;le of Wight, and the channel, which are pre&s;ented from the gar|dens at Walhampton; but they are &s;een under different circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Sir John D'Oyly's capital view is from a circular room at the top of his hou&s;e, which commands a very great extent both of &s;ea, and land. On the land-&s;ide the diver&s;ified woods of the fore&s;t appear &s;tretching far and wide around his hou&s;e, with all the inter|vening cultivation&mdash;hou&s;es&mdash;cottages&mdash;and farms. On the other &s;ide, the &s;ight extends along the channel of the i&s;le of Wight in both directions&mdash;to the we&s;t, as far as the open &s;ea; and to the ea&s;t, as far as Spithead,
<PB N="134" REF="139">
where every motion of the fleet, which is &s;tationed there, may be ob&s;erved. His lawn has lately been new-modelled, and is now only in a &s;tate of improvement; &s;o that it's effect cannot yet be &s;een.</P>
<P>At Pilewell Mr. Robbins's views towards the &s;ea, are nearly the &s;ame as tho&s;e from D'Oyly-park; only &s;een from a lower &s;tand. Mr. Robbins's lawn is a very exten&s;ive one. It is flat indeed; but &s;o much quiet &s;pace forms an excellent contra&s;t with the bu&s;y &s;cene of navigation, which is &s;pread beyond it. Still however the&s;e views are of the <HI>amu&s;ing</HI> kind. I &s;hould advi&s;e the <HI>picture&s;que</HI> eye therefore to &s;eek the &s;cenery of the i&s;land, as he will find it more broken, in many parts of the walk, which circles the lawn. The be&s;t view of the <HI>whole together</HI> is from the <HI>dre&s;&s;ing-room</HI> windows.</P>
<P>About a mile and a half from Badde&s;ly we pa&s;s the edge of a piece of fre&s;h-water, above three miles in circumference, known by the name of Souley-pond. In an inland-country it would have been thought a con|&s;iderable lake: but it's clo&s;e neighbourhood
<PB N="135" REF="140">
to the &s;ea dimini&s;hes the idea. It is not indeed &s;kreened by &s;uch noble limits, as dignify the lakes of We&s;tmorland and Cumberland; rocks, mountains, and craggy promontories; yet it is marked by an elegant irregular line; it's banks ari&s;e in gentle &s;wells from the water; in &s;ome places the &s;kirts of Beaulieu woods run down to it's edge; and in others low points of level land &s;hoot into it, which are always beautiful, e&s;pecially when adorned with groups of figures, or of cattle. On the whole it is a plea&s;ing &s;cene. It produces great plenty of fi&s;h; and often affords a &s;ummer-day's amu&s;ement to the gentlemen of the neigh|bourhood.</P>
<P>From Souley-pond the road leads towards the banks of Beaulieu-river, which are rather high in this part, and much wooded; &s;o that of cour&s;e the water is &s;kreened from the eye. The road however is very beautiful, pa&s;&s;ing through woody lanes, and open groves: and the woods of Beaulieu are the more beau|tiful, as they are almo&s;t univer&s;ally left untouched. You &s;carce &s;ee a maimed tree among them.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="141">About two miles from Souley, a &s;trange ruin attracts the eye, on the left. It appears like the two ends of a barn, the roof of which has fallen in. But the curio&s;ity of it is, it's amazing &s;ize. From one gavel-end to the other it extends eighty-one paces. The name it is known by, is St. Leonard's; and it is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a barn belonging to the monks of Beaulieu, who placed here a little e&s;tabli&s;hment of their fra|ternity, to gather the fruits of the country in the&s;e parts. The ve&s;tiges of different build|ings, and the walls of a &s;mall chapel, &s;till remain.&mdash;In a picture&s;que light this ruin is of no con&s;equence. We walked round it, and tried it in every mode of per&s;pective, if po&s;&s;ible to make a drawing from it, but the two va&s;t gavel-ends would enter into no kind of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Large barns were the common appendages of abbeys; and the ve&s;tiges of &s;ome of them &s;till remain. There is a grand building of this kind at Battle-abbey in Su&s;&s;ex; tho I &s;hould think is is more ornamented, than was requi&s;ite for a barn. There is another very large one at Cerne in Dor&s;et&s;hire. But the noble&s;t edifice, I believe, in England, under
<PB N="137" REF="142">
the denomination of a barn, is to be &s;een at Choul&s;ey in Berk&s;hire, about two miles from Wallingford. This barn is &s;till larger than that we are now &s;urveying. It is &s;ome|what above a hundred yards in length; and eighteen yards broad. It contains four thre&s;h|ing-floors; and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have belonged to the rich abbey of Reading. Tho carrying upon it the date of 1101, it is in good con|dition; and &s;till performs the functions of a barn. Mighty ca&s;tles, and churches in three or four centuries have given way to time: but here is a barn, which has continued doing it's offices to &s;ociety, through the &s;pace of &s;even hundred years.</P>
<P>From the ruins of St. Leonard's, the &s;ame woody road brought us &s;oon to Buckler's-hard, a beautiful &s;emi-circular valley, or rather a dip of the bank to the edge of the river, which forms before it one of it's grande&s;t &s;weeps.&mdash; In this plea&s;ing retreat the duke of Montague, predece&s;&s;or to the late duke, proprietor of all this part of the country, propo&s;ed to build a town, which was to bear his name. He was at that time proprietor al&s;o of the i&s;land of St. Lucia in the we&s;t-Indies; and as he enjoyed all the privileges on the river, of the
<PB N="138" REF="143">
abbey of Beaulieu, which were great, and would have enabled him to inve&s;t his colony with many immunities, he expected to derive much advantage from a &s;ugar trade; as &s;ugars might thus be imported, and from the plenty of fuel, refined, at a much cheaper rate here, than they could be any where el&s;e. And indeed the &s;cheme had the approbation of many men of &s;ounder judgment, than the duke's. The limits of a town were accordingly planned&mdash;the &s;treets were marked out&mdash;and the building-grounds adju&s;ted. But at the peace of 1748, St. Lucia was declared a neutral i&s;land, by which the duke's property in it was lo&s;t; and &s;oon after, his only &s;on dying, he dropped all farther intention with regard to his new town.</P>
<P>Buckler's-hard was however de&s;tined to re|ceive a town, tho of a different kind. The &s;ituation was commodious for &s;hip-building, as well as &s;ugar-boiling; and was taken for that purpo&s;e, by Mr. Adams, who made large contracts with government for building &s;hips of war.

<P>From this bu&s;y &s;cene, we pur&s;ued our way to Beaulieu-abbey; which is about two miles beyond it. The road is &s;till clo&s;e, and beau|tifully wooded. Within half a mile of it you look down from the higher grounds, into the circular valley, in which the ruins of the abbey &s;tand.</P>
<P>The valley it&s;elf is exten&s;ive, and con&s;i&s;ts of great variety of ground; and the whole &s;cene, but e&s;pecially the hills, which &s;urround it, are woody. Through the middle of it runs the river, which, about two miles above Beaulieu, is a mere fore&s;t-&s;tream, and has no con&s;e|quence, but what it receives from the beautiful
<PB N="140" REF="145">
&s;cenes, through which it wanders. Under the walls of the abbey it meets the tide, which immediately gives it form, and dignity. Here a bridge is thrown over it; on each &s;ide of which, it &s;preads into a lake, when the tide flows, &s;haping it's ample &s;weeps around rich wooded &s;hores. Both the&s;e grand ba&s;ons might ea&s;ily be kept con&s;tantly full, if a head were con&s;tructed, as I have heard it might be, acro&s;s the river, at the &s;econd reach below the abbey. The tide, in all probability would not ob&s;truct a work of this kind; as it flows here with little force, &s;carce at the rate of four miles an hour.</P>
<P>The precincts of the abbey, which &s;tands on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the river, are, in circum|ference, about a mile and a half. The boun|dary-wall is intire in &s;everal parts; and vi&s;ible almo&s;t in all. The area, within the boundary, is nearly flat; and might ea&s;ily be made a very beautiful &s;cene. Along the banks of the river the ground is a little varied, where a plea&s;ant walk has been laid out, which is now pictu|re&s;quely marked by the ruins of time. The bank is here &s;omewhat higher than the river; and was formerly, in this part, the foundation of the boundary-wall of the abbey; which,
<PB N="141" REF="146">
when the wall was intire, compleatly hid the river, and all it's beautiful appendages from the walk. Time has now re&s;tored them. Tho the wall yet holds out in &s;ome places, it has in general failed. Large portions of it are gone; and in other parts there are cha&s;ms, and fractures, through which the river, and the &s;urrounding woods appear often to great advantage from the walk. Old oaks likewi&s;e, coeval with the abbey it&s;elf, are &s;cattered pro|fu&s;ely around the ruins of the wall; &s;ometimes &s;upporting it, and &s;ometimes &s;upported by it. They are every where beautiful appendages; and in many places unite with the ruins of the wall into the mo&s;t plea&s;ing <HI>fore-grounds;</HI> while the river, &s;pread here into a lake, and the woods beyond it, form a <HI>di&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P>Among the&s;e ruins, I remember, &s;ome years ago, to have &s;een a very extraordi|nary in&s;tance of vegetation. The main &s;tem of an oak aro&s;e in contact with a part of the wall, which was intire; and extended one of it's principal limbs along the &s;ummit of it. This limb, at the di&s;tance of a few yards from the parent-tree finding a fi&s;&s;ure in the wall, in which there might probably be &s;ome depo&s;it of &s;oil, &s;hot a root through it into the earth.
<PB N="142" REF="147">
From hence, &s;hooting up again through ano|ther part of the wall, it formed a new &s;tem, as large as the original tree; and from this again proceeded another horizontal branch like the former. In a great &s;torm, which hap|pened on the 27th of february 1781, both the wall, and the tree were blown down together.</P>
<P>Great part of the area between this beautiful walk, and the abbey, is occupied by an open grove; part of which is beautiful, and part deformed. The rea&s;on of the difference is, that one part is planted carele&s;ly by the hand of nature; the other regularly by that of art.</P>
<P>Of the buildings of the abbey con&s;i|derable parts remain; enough to &s;hew, that it has formerly been con&s;tructed in a rich Gothic &s;tile: tho it's dimen&s;ions were never large. The parts &s;till in being of mo&s;t con&s;equence, are what is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the refectory, and the abbot's lodge. The refectory is now turned into a pari&s;h-church, and forms a hand&s;ome aile, which is worth looking into. The abbot's lodge is known by the name of the palace, and was fitted up by the predece&s;&s;or of the la&s;t duke of Montague, as a man&s;ion; tho he made little addition to it. The old hall &s;till remains, and
<PB N="143" REF="148">
&s;ome of the other apartments. What he added, is ill-done; and what he did in the way of ta&s;te, is whim&s;ical, and ill-managed. He did nothing indeed that adorns this beau|tiful &s;cene; many things which deform it; and &s;ome things &s;o &s;trangely ab&s;urd, that no genius but his own, could have conceived them. In&s;tead of calling in &s;ome man of ta&s;te to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in making Beaulieu-abbey one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;cenes in England, which it might have been; he employed an engineer, by who&s;e help he drew a ditch around it; filled it with water; threw two or three draw-bridges over it; &s;ecured all the avenues; and thus, by a wonderful &s;troke of art, converted an abbey into a ca&s;tle. This atchievement was performed about the time of a French war, and a rebellion; when the duke had been rai&s;ing a regiment, and his ideas had taken a military turn. It is &s;aid too, that he made this &s;trange metamorpho&s;is under an appre|hen&s;ion, le&s;t &s;ome adventrous French privateer, taking the advantage of a full-tide, might &s;ail up the river, and endeavour to carry him off.&mdash; Men of ta&s;te cannot enough lament, that a &s;ituation, &s;o well adapted to receive the beauties of art, &s;hould have fallen &s;o unhappily into
<PB N="144" REF="149">
&s;uch wretched hands; and that more money had been &s;pent in deforming it, than might have made it a &s;cene of uncommon beauty.</P>
<P>Of the other parts of the abbey little re|mains. There is a court about &s;ixty or &s;eventy feet &s;quare, formerly perhaps a cloi&s;ter, which is now converted into a garden. In the inner walls remain &s;everal arches, now clo&s;ed, two or three of which are of beautiful Gothic. Near this court al&s;o &s;tands a &s;mall room, roughly arched. The arches are of &s;tone, centering in a point at the top: but it does not ea&s;ily appear for what purpo&s;e &s;o &s;mall an apart|ment was intended. The kitchen is &s;till very intire; as this edifice often is among the ruins of abbeys. It was a &s;tructure commonly of great &s;trength.</P>
<P>But tho the &s;ituation of Beaulieu-abbey is very plea&s;ing; and perhaps more monki&s;h, than could ea&s;ily have been found in the neigh|bourhood; yet if a noble family-man&s;ion &s;hould be intended, a much grander &s;ituation might be cho&s;en in many parts of this beau|tiful country; particularly on the high grounds, a little to the north of Buckler's-hard, nearly about the point, where the road from thence
<PB N="145" REF="150">
unites with that from Lymington. This &s;ituation commands a grand &s;weep over the river, together with it's e&s;tuary&mdash;the woods on both &s;ides of it, which are rich, and ample in a high degree&mdash;and in the di&s;tance the channel, and the high grounds of the i&s;le of Wight, from Cowes' point to the Needles.</P>
<P>The privileges of the manor of Beaulieu, which were granted by king John, were very exten&s;ive; and are &s;till pre&s;erved. No debtor can be arre&s;ted within it's precincts, unle&s;s the lord's leave be obtained. The lords of Beaulieu al&s;o enjoy the liberties of the Cinque|ports; and the &s;ame exemption from duties; which was the duke's principal rea&s;on, as was ob&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 138.</NOTE>, for building a town at Buckler's-hard. They hunt al&s;o, and de&s;troy the king's deer, if they &s;tray within the purlieus of the abbey. On the day we were at Beaulieu, we found the hedges every where be&s;et with armed men. There were not fewer than twenty, or thirty. It appeared as if &s;ome inva&s;ion was expected. On inquiry we were
<PB N="146" REF="151">
informed, a &s;tag had been &s;een that morning in the manor; and all the village of Beaulieu was in arms to prevent his e&s;cape back into the fore&s;t. The fortunate man, who &s;hot him, had a gratuity from the lord.</P>
<P>Beaulieu-manor is an exten&s;ive &s;cene, being not le&s;s than twenty-eight miles in circum|ference. It con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of woodlands; and be&s;ides the deer, which accidentally &s;tray into it from the fore&s;t, contains a great number of deer in it's own domains. Among the&s;e rough grounds are intermixed many valuable farms; and the whole yields annually about &pound;. 4000.</P>
<P>As we leave Beaulieu-abbey, along the Lyndhur&s;t road, we &s;kirt the upper lake, which is formed by the tide above the bridge. It is a beautiful &s;heet of water, about a mile in circumference, &s;urrounded, on every &s;ide with woods, which in many parts fall into it from the ri&s;ing grounds. As the view opens, we look full up the lake. On the right the abbey appears among the woods to great advantage. On the left, a winding road runs along it's margin; except where
<PB N="147" REF="152">
in &s;ome parts it is intercepted by clumps of trees. In front, the woods recede a little from the water, and leave a &s;pace of flat meadow, which has a good effect in contra&s;t with the ri&s;ing grounds, and woods on each &s;ide.&mdash;The whole &s;cene is plea&s;ing. Soon after we leave the lake, the river dwindles into a &s;luggi&s;h, little, bull-ru&s;h &s;tream. The meadow, however through which it winds, are adorned with wood, and &s;till continue beautiful.</P>
<P>At a place called the <HI>Fighting-cocks,</HI> well known to the lurking poacher, the manor of Beaulieu ends; and we entered the wild &s;cenes of the fore&s;t. Deep woods received us. Through the&s;e we rode near two miles, ri&s;ing gently from the river; and then emerged into an open &s;cene, called <HI>Culverly-heath</HI>&mdash; one of tho&s;e beautiful woody-&s;kirted lawns, of which we had &s;een &s;o many in the we&s;tern parts of the fore&s;t; and yet the features of this were different from them all.&mdash;We &s;tood on a rough knoll, decorated with a few full-grown oaks, de&s;cending in front into a lawn, which appeared to &s;tretch about a
<PB N="148" REF="153">
mile in front; and a league on each &s;ide. It was &s;kirted in every part with woods, &s;hooting out, and retiring in &s;kreens on each &s;ide; and folding over each other. The whole was a plea&s;ing piece of fore&s;t-per&s;pective, and the lawn one of the mo&s;t picture&s;que compo&s;itions we had met with, in this mode of land&s;cape.</P>
<P>Soon after we left Culverly-heath, we en|tered another &s;cene of the &s;ame kind&mdash;larger, but le&s;s varied. In Culverly-heath the ma|terials of land&s;cape were brought together in &s;o perfect a manner, as to produce a pic|ture&s;que whole. Here, through an awkward|ne&s;s in the compo&s;ition, there was but an indifferent whole, tho many of the parts in them&s;elves were beautiful.</P>
<P>From this heath we entered a large wood, called Denny. It has once been a noble &s;cene, but it is now &s;tripped of it's princi|pal honours, and con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of beech, with a few decrepid oaks &s;tragling among them. Every where we &s;aw noble <HI>&s;tools,</HI> as they call the &s;tumps of &s;uch trees as have been cut down; and could form an idea of their grandeur, by the re&s;pectful &s;pace they have formerly occupied. None of
<PB N="149" REF="154">
the trees in the neighbourhood &s;eem to have approached within a con&s;iderable di&s;tance of them.</P>
<P>In this wood, which makes a part of Denny-walk, the lodge belonging to it, is &s;eated. Here we left the Lyndhur&s;t road, which we had thus far pur&s;ued from Beaulieu; and turning to the left, directed our cour&s;e to Whitley-ridge-lodge. In the neighbourhood of this place we found &s;ome beautiful &s;cenes. One of them has peculiar merit.&mdash;It is a &s;mall fore&s;t-lawn, containing about &s;even or eight acres &s;omewhat circular, and &s;kirted with oaks, thickets, and open groves; but they are di&s;po&s;ed in &s;o happy a manner, and &s;o much broken by clumps &s;tanding out from the other woods, that all the regularity of it's form is removed. This lawn is the favourite haunt of deer in &s;ummer-evenings; and their con&s;tant feeding upon it, has given the fine&s;t texture to it's turf. It is rough enough to &s;hew it's alliance with the fore&s;t; but, like &s;ome of nature's faire&s;t forms, it has &s;o poli&s;hed an appearance, that with the &s;malle&s;t improvement it might accompany the mo&s;t cultivated &s;cene.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="155">From hence we continued our rout through woods, like tho&s;e of Denny, as far as Lady-cro&s;s-lodge. The&s;e ravaged parts of the fore&s;t, tho they &s;till afford many plea&s;ing &s;cenes, yet deprived of their noble&s;t trees, are de|prived al&s;o of their principal beauty. Tho inferior wood, as we had frequent opportunity to ob&s;erve, might produce di&s;tant &s;cenery, yet when we enter the internal parts of a fore&s;t, we wi&s;h for objects of grandeur. In fore&s;t-glades e&s;pecially, where the &s;cenes are &s;mall, large trees on the fore-ground are almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>From the woods of Lady-cro&s;s, we entered the we&s;tern &s;ide of that va&s;t heath, which occupies all the middle ground between the rivers of Lymington, and Beaulieu.&mdash;It is not a &s;cene, like that of Culverly, and others, in which the woods, and open country bear a proportion to each other; it is diffu&s;e, and unadorned. The circumambient woods are too incon&s;iderable; and yet it is every where &s;urrounded with them. Tho&s;e of
<PB N="151" REF="156">
Heathy-Dilton occupied the right; and in|troduced, as we &s;kirted this &s;ide of the heath, &s;ome little &s;cenery: but all other parts were naked. In front indeed ranged a meagre &s;kirting of wood; beyond which the high grounds of the i&s;le of Wight formed a di&s;|tance.</P>
<P>As we proceeded farther on this heath, Norley-wood aro&s;e at &s;ome di&s;tance on the left. Towards this, acro&s;s the heath, we bent our cour&s;e, as we were told it afforded &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful <HI>internal &s;cenery</HI> of any part of the fore&s;t.&mdash;Norley-wood &s;tretches about two miles in length; and taking a &s;emicircular turn, forms &s;ome heathy grounds, which hang to the &s;outh, into a bay.&mdash;As a di&s;tant object however, it's woods po&s;&s;e&s;s only common beauties. To &s;ee it's oaks in their glory, we mu&s;t enter it's rece&s;&s;es. Their forms are remarkably picture&s;que; and their combinations are as plea&s;ing as their forms. The&s;e combinations are greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a profu&s;ion of holly, and other humble plants, which are inter&s;per&s;ed among the trees.&mdash;This delightful &s;cenery al&s;o is happily opened. Several roads winding in different directions, through the wood, form
<PB N="152" REF="157">
a variety of little rece&s;&s;es. Sometimes we were pre&s;ented with a longer reach; &s;ome|times with a &s;udden turn: and the beauty generally aro&s;e from &s;eeing little removed clumps of wood, in Waterlo's &s;tile, variou&s;ly ri&s;ing behind one or two &s;tately trees on the fore-ground, who&s;e dark branches gave their inlightened foliage effect. Other varieties are introduced by the <HI>inter&s;ections</HI> of roads; and others by the gra&s;s running among full-grown trees, or clumps of underwood;
<Q><L>Where frequent tufts of holly, box, or thorn,</L>
<L>Steal on the green&s;werd; but admit fair &s;pace,</L>
<L>For many a mo&s;&s;y maze to wind between.</L></Q>
In &s;hort, we found in&s;tances here, in great perfection, of every mode of &s;cenery, which I have already de&s;cribed in the internal parts of a fore&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. I. page 211.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a circum&s;tance connected with this wood, which is rarely found in tho&s;e woods, which occupy the middle regions of the fore&s;t; and that is a hamlet of tho&s;e little tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing cottages &s;cattered about it, which have already been mentioned<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See vol. I. page 216.</NOTE>. They
<PB N="153" REF="158">
commonly &s;tand detached, and one or other of them meets the eye in various parts, and adds much to the &s;cene. I have already ex|plained, how far &s;uch circum&s;tances affect both natural, and artificial land&s;cape<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. I. page 217.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a few years however, all the beautiful &s;cenery of Norley-wood will vani&s;h. It's de&s;truction has long been expected; and was lately determined. In the beginning of the year 1781, a band of wood-cutters entered it, with orders from the &s;urveyor of the fore&s;t to cut a hundred of the be&s;t trees, which he had previou&s;ly marked for the u&s;e of the navy. The&s;e trees were &s;et apart for building &s;hips of the fir&s;t and &s;econd rates. The next year another fall of the &s;ame kind of timber was ordered: and in three or four years, when all the noble trees are gone, the refu&s;e will be de&s;tined to &s;hips of inferior &s;ize, frigates, &s;loops, and cutters. During &s;even years it is &s;uppo&s;ed this wood will yield a con&s;iderable &s;upply to the yards of Port&s;mouth. At pre&s;ent however a re&s;pite is given it; and the de|predations, which have been made, have not yet greatly injured it's beauty. In &s;ome parts
<PB N="154" REF="159">
they may have improved it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. I. page 266.</NOTE>, by &s;everal open|ings, which the wood-cutters have made; tho the &s;cenes of Norley-wood admit improve|ments of this kind, le&s;s than almo&s;t any other &s;cenes in the fore&s;t; as they <HI>naturally</HI> abound in openings, and rece&s;&s;es. If a few more attacks however be made upon it, it's glory will be extinct; and Norley-wood like other ravaged woods, will &s;ugge&s;t only the remem|brance of a &s;cene.</P>
<P>And yet the various appendages of wood-cutting&mdash;piles of bark, and &s;cattered boughs, and timber-wains, are not unplea&s;ing objects<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See vol. I. page 267.</NOTE>. The deep, hollow tone al&s;o of the wood-man's axe, or of axes re&s;pon&s;ive to each other, in different parts of the wood, are notes in full harmony with the &s;cene, tho their mu&s;ic is a knell.</P>
<P>The fallen tree al&s;o, lying with it's white, peeled branches on the ground, is not only beautiful in it&s;elf; but if it be not &s;cattered in too great profu&s;ion (for white is an unac|commodating hue) it forms an agreeable con|tra&s;t with the living trees. But when we &s;ee it deprived of it's beautiful ramification, &s;quared,
<PB N="155" REF="160">
and &s;awn in lengths, as it &s;ometimes continues long to lie about the fore&s;t, it becomes an object of deformity; and we lament what it once was, without receiving any equivalent from it's pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>It may here al&s;o be remarked, that the king's timber is much more picture&s;que, than &s;uch timber, as is bought, and cut by the mer|chant. He, with cautious, and di&s;cerning eye, &s;tands at the bottom of the tree, while it is yet alive; and having examined every twi&s;ting limb, and de&s;tined every part to it's proper &s;ervice, lops them off, one by one; and then fells the tree, a deformed and mutilated trunk. The royal wood-cutter is le&s;s nice. He fells the tree as it grows; and leaves the dock-men to a&s;certain the u&s;es of it's &s;everal parts. Two or three of the main limbs are generally reft, and &s;plintered in the fall; but that is not his concern: in the mean time, the ruin of the whole, with all it's &s;preading parts about it, retains &s;till a degree of picture&s;que beauty.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A voyage up Beaulieu-river.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE river Avon is the boundary of the fore&s;t on the we&s;t; and the bay of Southampton on the ea&s;t. Neither of the&s;e rivers therefore properly belongs to the fore&s;t. The only rivers, which may ju&s;tly be called fore&s;t-rivers, are tho&s;e of Lymington, and Beaulieu. The former of the&s;e we have already examined in various parts; the latter only about the abbey of Beaulieu. We deter|mined therefore to inve&s;tigate the whole by a voyage.</P>
<P>We took boat in Lymington-river; which at low-water winds beautifully, before it enter the &s;ea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 97.</NOTE>. Its banks indeed are mud, but of the be&s;t &s;pecies; for they are covered, like the other mud-lands of this country, with
<PB N="158" REF="162">
&s;ea-gra&s;s, which gives them the air of mea|dows when the tide retires. The returning water over-runs all the boundaries of the river, and makes it nece&s;&s;ary, for the u&s;e of ve&s;&s;els of any burden, to mark its channel with &s;takes.&mdash;The mouth of the river is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a larger po&s;t, known among fi&s;hermen, by the name of <HI>Jack in the ba&s;ket.</HI> It &s;tands about three miles from Lymington-harbour.</P>
<P>At this boundary we entered the channel, which divides the <HI>coa&s;t of Hamp&s;hire</HI> from the <HI>i&s;le of Wight.</HI> The former, which &s;tretches along the left, appears as a flat woody di&s;tance, ju&s;t rai&s;ed above the edge of the water; and unmarked by any object of con&s;equence. They who are acquainted with the country, can point out, here and there, a hou&s;e, ju&s;t &s;een among the trees.</P>
<P>On the right, the i&s;le of Wight makes a better appearance; and yet not a picture&s;que one. It con&s;i&s;ts of a double ridge of high lands; which, in almo&s;t every part, are ill-&s;haped, and in &s;ome parts the upper, and lower grounds follow each other in a di&s;a|greeable parallel. Indeed we &s;eldom &s;ee a continuation of high grounds, through a &s;pace
<PB N="159" REF="163">
of near ten miles, forming &s;o unplea&s;ant a delineation. At lea&s;t it &s;eems &s;uch to any eye a&s;&s;imulated to the grandeur of a moun|tainous country.</P>
<P>The <HI>water-line</HI> of the i&s;land appears to more advantage. Among many &s;maller in|dentations of the coa&s;t, the bays of Totland, and New-town, are con&s;iderable. Totland-bay is formed by the we&s;tern point of the i&s;land, called the <HI>Needle-cliffs,</HI> on one &s;ide; and on the other by that promontary, which &s;hoots out oppo&s;ite to Hur&s;t-ca&s;tle, u&s;ually called <HI>Sconce-point.</HI> It is a rude, wild &s;cene; tho the cliffs them&s;elves are rather of the tame &s;pecies; without any of tho&s;e large parts, and projections, which give a rocky coa&s;t its mo&s;t picture&s;que form. New-town-bay affords an opening of a different kind. It is a &s;emicircular &s;weep into a country highly cultivated; which at a proper di&s;tance, when the &s;everal objects of cultivation are ma&s;&s;ed together, has a good effect.</P>
<P>As we approached the mouth of Beaulieu-river, it's opening promi&s;ed little. The ea&s;tern &s;ide forms a low, lineal, di&s;agreeable &s;hore.
<PB N="160" REF="164">
The we&s;tern &s;ide is &s;till more di&s;agreeable. It con&s;i&s;ts of a flat tongue of land, called <HI>Need&s;ore-point</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Need&s;ore, that is, Needs-&s;hore, but the <HI>&s;h</HI> was not u&s;ed is Saxon orthography. Hence Need&s;ore, Stan&s;ore, and other terminations of that kind on this coa&s;t; and Wind&s;or, Hed&s;or, &amp;c. on the Thames.</NOTE>, which runs out a con&s;iderable way; and at low-water unites with the mud-lands. When the tide flows, it is in part covered with water. We found it in this latter &s;ituation; and our boat made a &s;hort pu&s;h over it, in&s;tead of going round by the mouth of the river.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat remarkable, that there is one of the&s;e &s;pits of land, near the mouth of each of the&s;e fore&s;t-rivers; and al&s;o at the mouth of Southampton-bay. Hur&s;t-ca&s;tle, formerly intended to guard the pa&s;&s;age through the Needles, occupies one near the mouth of Lymington-river; and Cal&s;hot-ca&s;tle another, at the entrance of Southampton-bay. On Need&s;ore-point, which is the middle one, a fortre&s;s was thought unnece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;But tho the&s;e &s;pits of land are remarkable, they are ea&s;ily accounted for. The united force of wind and tide from the &s;outh-we&s;t, and
<PB N="161" REF="165">
we&s;t, &s;o much greater and more continued, than from any other quarter, is the natural, and obvious cau&s;e. The &s;ame thing happens at the entrance of Port&s;mouth-harbour. Spit|head is the barrier of it's channel, which runs clo&s;e along the ea&s;tern &s;hore under South-&s;ea-ca&s;tle, and Port&s;mouth-wall, much in the &s;ame manner as the channel of Beaulieu, or rather Exbury-haven, runs clo&s;e under the &s;hore from Leap. Wherever there is a low, or gravelly coa&s;t, undefended, on the &s;outhern &s;ide of our i&s;land, it gives way to the fury of the Atlantic winds and tides. The rocks of Purbeck protect the gravelly coa&s;t about Pool, and Chri&s;t-church. To the ea&s;t of the&s;e places there have certainly been depre|dations. Wight defends Port&s;mouth, and the &s;hores ea&s;tward as far as Arundel; which would probably go to &s;ea, if they were equally unpro|tected from the we&s;t, as from the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>We had now entered Beaulieu-river, which appears to be about half a mile broad. For &s;ome time Need&s;ore-point on the left, con|tinued a low, winding &s;hore; clo&s;ing us in behind; tedious, and unvaried. But, on the
<PB N="162" REF="166">
other &s;ide, the grounds began to form a beau|tiful bank.</P>
<P>As the reach opened, the &s;kreens improved. The high grounds about Exbury formed them|&s;elves into a point covered with wood; through which Exbury chapel ju&s;t appeared. The other &s;ide-&s;kreen was compo&s;ed of ancient woods, where the axe &s;eemed never to have entered. The river &s;till continued as wide as at the entrance; &s;tretching in front into an ample bay, confined by woods; but the extremity of the bay was &s;oftened by it's length, into a &s;econd-di&s;|tance.</P>
<P>By degrees we began to wind round Exbury-point; which &s;till continued a principal feature in the view. But tho it had greatly changed it's appearance; the woods and meadows, and rough grounds were &s;till very agreeably in|termixed. On the other &s;ide, the woods had taken a &s;weep with the river; and were thrown into good per&s;pective. They mantled down almo&s;t to the water; which was bordered only by a narrow edging of meadow. Here the river affording ea&s;y acce&s;s to the herds of the neighbouring pa&s;tures, they came down for refre&s;hment during the &s;ultry hours of a &s;ummer-noon. While they cooled them&s;elves in the river, the woods behind &s;heltered them
<PB N="163" REF="167">
from the &s;un; and formed a good back-ground to their &s;everal picture&s;que groups.&mdash;The front of this grand reach maintained long the &s;ame appearance, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of woody grounds &s;oftened by di&s;tance. Nor did the &s;ide-&s;kreens vary much. Continued woods &s;till ro&s;e on the left; and on the right a portion of rough pa&s;turage mingled with them.</P>
<P>We now came in &s;ight of Buckler's-hard <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of Buckler's-hard page 137. The word <HI>Hard</HI> &s;ignifies only a firm cau&s;eway made upon the mud, for the &s;ake of landing.</NOTE> on the left, where the large timber-yards, hou&s;es, and &s;hips on the &s;tocks, made a violent cha&s;m in the land&s;cape. A quantity of timber &s;cattered about a yard, makes a very unpicture&s;que appearance.&mdash;It affords a variety of parts without a whole. And yet in a timber-yard, there are &s;heds and other circum&s;tances, which are not wholly void of picture&s;que images. In a &s;hip on the &s;tocks, through every &s;tage as it advanes, there is a degree of beauty, which con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the variety of it's &s;weeping lines.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="168">At Buckler's-hard the reach of the river is very intere&s;ting, On the right are the woods of Beaulieu, winding round, with great richne&s;s, into a front-&s;kreen. On the left, where wood before abounded, the grounds now run more into pa&s;turage; tho far from being de&s;titute of furniture. One decoration they have, which is not unplea&s;ing. Where the meadows fall down to the water, they are &s;ecured from the tide, by low, &s;taked banks, which follow the winding banks of the river. If they had run in a &s;traight line, they would have been a great deformity; but as they wind, in&s;tead of being offen&s;ive objects, they give a &s;ort of rough, irregular termination to the line of the river. If we painted the &s;cene, we &s;hould have no objection to introduce them; both for the rea&s;on given, and al&s;o for the &s;ake of the reflections they form in the water.&mdash;They have &s;ometimes al&s;o the beauty of contra&s;t, when the other parts of the bank are without them.</P>
<P>From Buckler's-hard the river takes a &s;weep to the right. The woods likewi&s;e, on that &s;ide, follow it's cour&s;e; and &s;preading in great luxuriance, to the water's edge, throw a gloom over half the river. A noble bay,
<PB N="165" REF="169">
land-locked with wood, begins &s;oon to open. &mdash;As this &s;cene removes, the woods take a different form, &s;haping them&s;elves into re|moved &s;kreens, following each other.&mdash; Another reach brought us within fight of Beaulieu&mdash;the bridge and the abbey form|ing the centre of the view: the river, in the mean time, lo&s;ing very little of it's gran|deur, from the fir&s;t reach to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus we fini&s;hed our voyage up the river of Beaulieu; which in a cour&s;e of near three leagues from the &s;ea, forms about five, or &s;ix grand &s;weeps.&mdash;The &s;imple idea it pre&s;ents throughout, is that of a winding tide-river flowing up a <HI>woody, and uninhabited</HI> country; which is a &s;ingular character for an Engli&s;h river to a&s;&s;ume. Here and there we &s;ee a hou&s;e, and a few &s;pots of culti|vation; but &s;o little, that they make no impre&s;&s;ion on the general character of the &s;cene. The picture&s;que eye, u&s;ed to land|&s;cape, ea&s;ily overlooks the&s;e little ob&s;tacles; and carries on the general idea undi&s;turbed. &mdash;The bu&s;y &s;cene of &s;hip-building at Buck|ler's-hard, rather aided, than injured the idea:
<PB N="166" REF="170">
for as no one would expect a &s;cene of this kind in &s;o retired a place; it &s;eemed as if the adventurers, who had &s;ailed up the river, had landed here either to refit their &s;hips, or to build others for the purpo&s;e of pur&s;uing their di&s;coveries.</P>
<Q><L>Miratur nemus in&s;uetum fulgentia long&egrave;</L>

<P>The idea of a wild country, in a natural &s;tate, however picture&s;que, is to the generality of people but an unplea&s;ing one. There are few, who do not prefer the bu&s;y &s;cenes of cultivation to the grande&s;t of nature's rough productions. In general indeed, when we meet with a de&s;cription of a plea&s;ing country, we hear of hay-cocks, or waving corn-fields, or labourers at their plough, or other cir|cum&s;tances and objects, which the picture&s;que eye always wi&s;hes to exclude. The ca&s;e is, the &s;pectator &s;ympathi&s;es in the joys of a country, which ari&s;e from the pro&s;pect of plenty; and a&s;&s;ociating the&s;e ideas with the country it&s;elf, he calls it <HI>picture&s;que;</HI> by which he means only that it <HI>plea&s;es him.</HI> &mdash;Thus too in the grand, and &s;ublime &s;cenes of nature, if there be any mixture of
<PB N="167" REF="171">
horror in them (which often adds greatly to the <HI>picture&s;que</HI> effect) the a&s;&s;ociated ideas of unhappine&s;s cloud the &s;cene, and make it <HI>di&s;plea&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>I mean not, when a per&s;on is among objects, which in their remote con&s;equences give delight; or in the mid&s;t of &s;cenes, which are connected with di&s;tre&s;s; that he &s;hould not feel the natural impre&s;&s;ions they make &mdash;all I mean is, to inve&s;tigate the <HI>&s;ources of beauty;</HI> to limit the <HI>different modes</HI> of plea&s;ure, and pain; to &s;eparate <HI>cau&s;es,</HI> and <HI>effects;</HI> and to evince that a &s;cene, tho it abound with circum&s;tances of <HI>horror,</HI> may be very <HI>picture&s;que;</HI> while another may be intirely the <HI>rever&s;e,</HI> tho replete with incidents, that produce joy and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I have an in&s;tance at hand to my purpo&s;e. One of our voyagers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capt. King who &s;ucceeded capt. Cook, p. 207.</NOTE> to the northern &s;eas, in &s;ailing up a river, thus de&s;cribes the &s;cene.&mdash; "The country, &s;ays he, on each &s;ide, was very romantic; but unvaried; the river run|ning between mountains of the mo&s;t craggy and barren a&s;pect; where there was nothing
<PB N="168" REF="172">
to diver&s;ify the &s;cene, but now and then the &s;ight of a bear, or flights of wild-fowl. So unintere&s;ting a pa&s;&s;age leaves me nothing far|ther to add."</P>
<P>It is hardly po&s;&s;ible, in &s;o few words, to pre&s;ent more picture&s;que ideas of the horrid, and &s;avage kind. We have a river running up a country, broken on both &s;ides with wild, romantic rocks; which, we know nature never con&s;tructs in a uniform manner. We naturally therefore conclude, they ran out, in &s;ome parts, into va&s;t diagonal &s;trata; on the ledges of which a bear or two appeared, &s;itting on their hams, or howling at the boat. In other parts, the rocks would form lofty promontories, hanging over the river, and inhabited by numerous flights of &s;ea-fowl &s;creaming around them. This is not an imaginary picture; but copied with exactne&s;s from captain King's &s;ketch.&mdash; And yet he has no conception, that a &s;cene &s;o &s;avage could pre&s;ent any other ideas, than &s;uch as were di&s;gu&s;ting. He calls it an <HI>unvaried &s;cene;</HI> by which expre&s;&s;ion he meant nothing, I am per&s;uaded, but that the rocks were nei|ther intermixed with villages, nor with &s;cenes of cultivation. Wood might probably be wanting; but in a &s;cene of <HI>picture&s;que horror,</HI>
<PB N="169" REF="173">
wood is by no means a nece&s;&s;ary appendage. It is rather indeed an improper one. Flouri&s;h|ing wood at lea&s;t is out of place: the &s;cene might perhaps admit, here and there, a &s;cathed, and ragged pine.</P>
<P>Beyond Beaulieu our boat could not pa&s;s. Thus far only the tide flows with any force. At Beaulieu therefore we waited till the tide turned, when we again embarked.</P>
<P>The views in a&s;cending, and de&s;cending a river, vary con&s;iderably through it's &s;everal reaches. Yet the difference, tho ob&s;ervable enough, cannot ea&s;ily be de&s;cribed. Language wants colours to paint &s;uch nice di&s;tinctions. We &s;hall therefore fall down the river with a quicker &s;ail, than we a&s;cended. And yet we mu&s;t not leave it's retro&s;pect views entirely unob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The bay formed by the circling woods in the &s;econd reach as we de&s;cend, is very beau|tiful. I know not whether it's form is not more plea&s;ing, than we thought it in the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="174">The next reach lo&s;es in beauty. A long &s;tretch of low land &s;weeping acro&s;s the river, like a mole, which was le&s;s ob&s;ervable before, now greatly interrupts the beauty of the view.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding bay, where the woods of Exbury open in front, is very grand, and exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>From Buckler's-hard, nothing can unite more happily than the rough uncultivated grounds of Exbury on the left, with the long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Beaulieu woods on the right.</P>
<P>After this, the river &s;oon becomes an e&s;tuary. When we entered it, as we looked up the &s;tream, we had <HI>immediately</HI> the idea of a river winding into a woodland country. In the &s;ame manner, when we de&s;cended, we had <HI>as quickly</HI> an idea of a river entering the &s;ea. For as the woods, in the former ca&s;e, become at once the centre of the view; &s;o does the &s;ea, and the i&s;le of Wight, in the latter. The la&s;t reach therefore of the river continues long to exhibit a kind of mixed &s;cenery. Exbury-point, and the woody grounds about it, &s;till pre&s;erve the idea of the beautiful woodland &s;cenes we had left: while Need&s;ore-point, tho it wind quite around,
<PB N="171" REF="175">
and &s;hut us within a land-locked bay, is yet &s;o low, that the &s;ea, and the i&s;land appear beyond it.</P>
<P>On opening the mouth of the river, our boat-men attempted to carry us acro&s;s the mud-lands, as they had done in the morning; but they found it dangerous, and de&s;i&s;ted: for if a boat &s;hould only touch the ground, the delay of a few minutes might endanger her &s;ticking, till the return of the tide; &s;o rapidly do the waters retreat.</P>
<P>As the tide was thus leaving the mud-lands, flights of &s;ea-gulls hovered round, watching, on that event, to pick up the little wreck that remained. Sea-fowl are the common appendages of all e&s;tuaries. Indeed few ma&s;ters in land&s;cape omit them.</P>

<P>On &s;uch cla&s;&s;ical authority we admire the flights of &s;ea-gulls, as a proper ornament in a &s;cene like this. It was amu&s;ing to ob|&s;erve, how quickly they di&s;covered the re|linqui&s;hed &s;hore, long before it was di&s;coverable by us; and to &s;ee them running in appearance on the &s;urface of the water. For tho the tide had in tho&s;e parts left the land; yet the mud from it's perfect flatne&s;s long retained it's glazed, and watry appearance.&mdash;The cormorant al&s;o &s;at watching the ebbing tide: but he &s;eemed bent on matters of greater importance. He did not, like the idle gull, wheel round the air; nor pace about the ebbing &s;hore, mixing bu&s;ine&s;s and amu&s;ement together. With eager attention he took his &s;tand on &s;ome &s;olitary po&s;t, &s;et up to point the
<PB N="173" REF="177">
channel of the river; and from that eminence ob&s;erved from the dimpling of the waters, where &s;ome poor, wandering fi&s;h had gotten him&s;elf entangled in the &s;hallows, whom he marked for certain de&s;truction.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are not the only birds, which inliven a voyage up Beaulieu-river. In the lines I have ju&s;t quoted from Virgil's de|&s;cription of Aeneas's entrance into the Tyber (the whole of which might &s;erve with very little alteration for a de&s;cription al&s;o of Beau|lieu-river) two kinds of birds are introduced. &mdash;Tho&s;e, which di&s;port them&s;elves <HI>in flu|minis alveo;</HI> and tho&s;e, which <HI>aethera mulcebant cantu, lucoque volabant.</HI> With the actions of the former of the&s;e we have already been entertained: but we have not yet li&s;tened to the mu&s;ic of the latter. I have been told it is extraordinary; and that all the&s;e woods, on both &s;ides of the river (&s;o exten&s;ive are they, and unmole&s;ted) are filled with &s;uch innumerable flights of &s;inging birds, that to &s;ail up the river in a morning, or an evening in the &s;pring, affords, in Virgil's language, an <HI>avium concentus,</HI> hardly any where el&s;e to be found. The nightingale, the thru&s;h, the blackbird, and the linnet are the chief per|formers
<PB N="174" REF="178">
in the concert. Some of the&s;e you hear continually bur&s;ting out either at hand, or from a di&s;tance: while the various petty chirpers of the woods join the chorus: and tho alone their little untuneable voices might be har&s;h; yet all together (one &s;oftening the di&s;cordancy of another) they make a kind of melody; or at lea&s;t an agreeable contra&s;t to &s;uch of the band, as are better &s;killed in their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I cannot leave this river-&s;cene, without ob&s;erving, that altho it is picture&s;que in a high degree; yet it exhibits &s;uch a &s;pecimen of the picture&s;que (if I may &s;peak in terms &s;eemingly contradictory) as is not well cal|culated to make a picture. The whole is a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e &s;ofter, namele&s;s beauties; which highly plea&s;e; but cannot ea&s;ily be de&s;cribed. <HI>Various beautiful accompaniments</HI> are exhibited: but <HI>&s;triking objects</HI> are wanting.

<HEAD>SECT. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>An excur&s;ion along the ea&s;tern &s;ide of Beaulieu river&mdash;the coa&s;t oppo&s;ite to the i&s;le of Wight&mdash;the we&s;tern &s;ide of Southampton bay&mdash;and thence by Dibden again to Beaulieu.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT Beaulieu we cro&s;&s;ed the bridge; and turning &s;hort to the right, had a better view of the fir&s;t reach of the river from the land, than we had before in our voyage, from the water. The river it&s;elf had more the appearance of a lake, (for it was then high-water,) and made a magnificent &s;weep round a point of wooded land: while the woods, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, following it's cour&s;e, on an elevated bank, were as rich, as a picture&s;que imagination could conceive them. The fore|ground indeed was not equal to a &s;cene, which was in every other re&s;pect &s;o compleat.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="182">From hence we a&s;cended a clo&s;e lane cut through a corner of Beaulieu-manor; and inriched on both &s;ides, but e&s;pecially on the left, with fore&s;t-&s;cenery. At Hill-top-gate the lane opens into that exten&s;ive heath, which occupies all the middle part of the penin&s;ula, between the river of Beaulieu, and the bay of Southampton. As this penin&s;ula &s;hoots into length, rather than breadth, the heathy grounds follow it's form; and extend &s;everal miles in one direction; tho &s;eldom above two, in the other. The banks of both rivers are woody; and the&s;e woods appeared, as we entered the heath, to &s;kirt it's extremities. Through the&s;e extremities, containing the mo&s;t beautiful parts of the country, we meant to travel. At Hill-top therefore, in&s;tead of cro&s;&s;ing the heath, we turned &s;hort into a road on the right, which led us along the &s;kirts of the woods, under the &s;hade of which we travelled about a mile. Sometimes the&s;e woods &s;hot like promontories into the heath, and we were obliged to ride round them; but oftner our road threading the clumps, and &s;ingle trees, which &s;tood forward, carried us among them. The richne&s;s, and clo&s;ene&s;s of the fore&s;t-&s;cenery on one &s;ide, contra&s;ted with the
<PB N="179" REF="183">
plainne&s;s, and &s;implicity of the heath on the other, &s;kirted with di&s;tant wood, and &s;een through the openings of the clumps, were plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>From this heath we were received by lanes &mdash;but &s;uch lanes, as a fore&s;t only can produce; in which oak, and a&s;h, full-grown, and plan|ted irregularly by the hand of nature, &s;tood out in various groups, and added a new fore|ground, every &s;tep we took, to a variety of little openings into woods, cop&s;es, and plea&s;ing rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>While we were admiring the&s;e clo&s;e land|&s;capes, the woods, on the right &s;uddenly giving way, we were pre&s;ented with a view of the river&mdash;Buckler's-hard beyond it&mdash;the men of war building in the dock there&mdash;and the woody grounds which ri&s;e in the off&s;kip. This exhibition was rather formally introduced like a vi&s;ta. The woods &s;eemed to have been opened on purpo&s;e: but formality is a fault, which we &s;eldom find in nature; and which in the &s;cene before us, &s;he will probably cor|rect in a few years, by the growth of &s;ome intervening trees.</P>
<P>A mile farther brought us to the &s;eat of colonel Mitford, among the woods of Exbury.
<PB N="180" REF="184">
The hou&s;e is no object: but the &s;cenery con|&s;i&s;ts of a more beautiful profu&s;ion of wood, water, and varied grounds, than is commonly to be met with. Here we propo&s;ed to &s;pend the evening; but not finding colonel Mitford at home, we took a ramble into his woods, till &s;upper, where we expected to meet him.</P>
<P>The richne&s;s of the &s;cenes had led us imper|ceptibly from one to another. We had every where in&s;tances of the beauty of trees as <HI>indi|viduals</HI>&mdash;as uniting in <HI>clumps</HI>&mdash;and as &s;preading into <HI>woods;</HI> for all here is pure nature: and as they were beginning now to put on their au|tumnal attire, we were entertained with the beauties of <HI>colouring,</HI> as well as of <HI>form.</HI> Among the&s;e unknown woods our way at length became perplexed; and the &s;un was now &s;et. Having no time therefore to lo&s;e, we inquired at a lonely cottage, which we found in a &s;heltered glade. Nothing could indicate peace and happine&s;s more, than this little &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot; and we expected to find a neat, peaceful, contented family within. But we found that a happy &s;cene will not always make happy inhabitants. At the door &s;tood two, or three &s;qualid children with eager, fami&s;hed countenances &s;taring through
<PB N="181" REF="185">
matted hair. On entering the hovel, it was &s;o dark, that we could at fir&s;t &s;ee nothing. By degrees a &s;cene of mi&s;ery opened. We &s;aw other ragged children within; and were &s;oon &s;truck with a female figure, groveling at full length by the &s;ide of a few embers, upon the hearth. Her arms were naked to her &s;houl|ders; and her rags &s;carce covered her body. On our &s;peaking to her, &s;he uttered in return a mixture of ob&s;cenity, and imprecations. We had never &s;een &s;o deplorable a maniac.</P>
<P>We had not ob&s;erved, when we entered, what now &s;truck us, a man &s;itting in the cor|ner of the hovel, with his arms folded, and a look of dejection, as if lo&s;t in de&s;pair. We a&s;ked him, Who that wretched per&s;on was? She is my wife, &s;aid he, with a compo&s;ed melancholy; and the mother of the&s;e children. He &s;eemed to be a man of great &s;en&s;ibility; and it &s;truck us, what di&s;tre&s;s he mu&s;t feel, every evening, after his labour, when, in&s;tead of finding a little dome&s;tic comfort, he met the mi&s;ery, and horror of &s;uch a hou&s;e&mdash;the total neglect of his little affairs&mdash;his family without any over&s;eer, brought up in idlene&s;s, and dirt&mdash;and his wife, for whom he had no means of providing either a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or cure,
<PB N="182" REF="186">
lying &s;o wretched an object always before him. &mdash;We left him &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with his calamity; which appeared to be a more &s;evere vi&s;itation, than the hand of heaven commonly inflicts.</P>
<P>We found afterwards, that we had been wholly mi&s;taken; and that we had before us a &s;trong in&s;tance of that &s;trange fatality, by which mankind are &s;o often them&s;elves the mini&s;ters of tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which they are &s;o ready to a&s;cribe to heaven. On relating our adventure at &s;upper, we were informed, that the man, who&s;e appearance of &s;en&s;ibility had affected us &s;o much, was one of the mo&s;t har|dened, abandoned, mi&s;chievous fellows in the country&mdash;that he had been detected in &s;heep|&s;tealing&mdash;and that he had killed a neighbour's hor&s;e in an act of revenge&mdash;and that it was &s;uppo&s;ed, he had given his wife, who was infamous likewi&s;e, a blow in a quarrel, which had occa&s;ioned her malady.</P>
<P>The next morning we took a particular view of the beautiful &s;cenery around us; of which, the evening before, we had only obtained a general idea.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="187">The woods of Exbury, which are exten&s;ive, are chiefly oak&mdash;the &s;pontaneous growth of the country: but Mr. Mitford found many of the bare, and barren &s;pots about his hou&s;e planted by his father, and grandfather, with fir-groves of various kinds; tho generally, according to the fa&s;hion of the times, in formal rows.</P>
<P>On a deliberate view of his grounds, he formed a general plan, re&s;ulting from the various &s;cenes they exhibited.&mdash;The boun|dary of his e&s;tate pre&s;ents a &s;eries of views of three very different characters.&mdash;Towards the we&s;t, he has a variety of grand river-views; formed by the Ex, or, as it is commonly at this day called, Beaulieu-river, winding, as we had &s;een it in our voyage, through the woods of Beaulieu, and Exbury in it's approach to the &s;ea.&mdash;The &s;outhern part of his boundary overlooks, what was anciently called, the Solent-&s;ea; but now commonly the channel of the i&s;le of Wight; which at it's two extre|mities di&s;covers the open &s;ea, through the ea&s;tern pa&s;&s;age by Spithead; and through the we&s;tern, by the Needles.&mdash;On the ea&s;t, and north, his boundary-views take a new form. We leave the &s;hore, and wind into a woodland country; which within a hundred
<PB N="184" REF="188">
yards a&s;&s;umes &s;o new a character, that we might ea&s;ily conceive it to be as many miles from the &s;ea. In the&s;e woody &s;cenes, inter|mixed with open grounds, we continue about four miles; till winding round, we return to tho&s;e ri&s;ing grounds on the we&s;t, from whence we fir&s;t had the views of the river.</P>
<P>This boundary-circuit carries us through the &s;pace of about eight miles. Mr. Mitford has done little, be&s;ides marking it out by cut|ting through the woods, as he &s;hould wi&s;h to lead it. To compleat his plan would be very expen&s;ive; tho an expence equal to the natural advantages of the &s;cene in good hands, would make this one of the mo&s;t varied, and picture&s;que wood-land-rides perhaps in Eng|land.</P>
<P>Within this boundary-circuit Mr. Mitford has marked out an interior one, circling about a mile round his hou&s;e. As the object of the larger circuit, is to &s;hew, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the extent of his views; the object of this interior one is to break tho&s;e di&s;tant views into parts&mdash;to form tho&s;e parts into the mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenes; and to exhibit them with woody fore-grounds to the be&s;t advantage. From many parts of this interior &s;cenery the
<PB N="185" REF="189">
i&s;le of Wight makes it's mo&s;t picture&s;que appearance. In various views of it from the Hamp&s;hire coa&s;t, we have &s;een it &s;pread in too lengthened a curtain, and it's hills too &s;mooth, and tame. Both the&s;e inconveniences are here, in a degree, obviated. Seldom more than a &s;mall part of the i&s;land is &s;een at once; and this part is about the centre, which is the loftie&s;t, and the roughe&s;t. Here ri&s;e two con&s;iderable hills, Gate&s;cliff, and Wraxhill; and one of them affords a circum&s;tance of great beauty. Cari&s;broke-ca&s;tle, &s;eated on an eminence, about four miles within the i&s;land, is &s;een very advantageou&s;ly again&s;t Gate&s;cliff, when the &s;un &s;hines either on the ca&s;tle, or on the mountain; while the other is in &s;hadow.</P>
<P>In laying out this inner circle, Mr. Mitford had his greate&s;t difficulties to contend with: for here he had all his grandfather's formal groves to incounter: and it was no ea&s;y matter to break their formalities; to make judicious inroads through them; and unite them in one plan. He often lamented&mdash;what other improvers have lamented before him&mdash;the injudicious &s;ufferance of the growth of trees. Next to the cutting down of trees improperly,
<PB N="186" REF="190">
the greate&s;t mi&s;chief is to let them grow together too long. They &s;oon ruin each other. He had &s;uffered his woodward only to u&s;e his di&s;cretion in the di&s;tant woods. In the groves, about his hou&s;e, he allowed no marking-hammer, but his own. The con&s;equence was, he was &s;o little on the &s;pot, that many of his be&s;t trees were injured. The fir e&s;pe|cially, if it's natural branches are once lo&s;t, as they always are by &s;traitened quarters, never recovers them.&mdash;The&s;e two circuits round his hou&s;e, Mr. Mitford has joined by three cro&s;s walks</P>
<P>In taking the&s;e circuits we could not help remarking the comparative virtue of ta&s;te, and expence. The former, with very little of the latter, will always produce &s;omething plea&s;ing: while the utmo&s;t efforts of the latter, unaided by the former, are ineffectual. The larger the proportion of mi&s;guided ex|pence; the wider will the deformity &s;pread: whereas every touch in the hand of ta&s;te, has &s;o far it's effect.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame preci&s;ely in working the &s;cenes of nature, as in forming an artificial &s;cene. Set two arti&s;ts at work. Give one of them a bit of black-lead, and a &s;crap of paper.
<PB N="187" REF="191">
Every touch he makes, perhaps de&s;erves to be trea&s;ured in a cabinet. Give the other the co&s;tlie&s;t materials. All is a wa&s;te of time, of labour, and expence. Add colours&mdash;they only make his deformities more glaring.</P>
<P>True ta&s;te, in the fir&s;t place, whether in nature, or on canvas, makes not a &s;ingle &s;troke, till the general de&s;ign is laid out, with which, in &s;ome part or other, every effort coincides. The arti&s;t may work at his picture in this part or the other; but if his de&s;ign, and compo&s;ition are fixed, every effort is gradually growing into a whole. Whereas he who works without ta&s;te, &s;eldom has any idea of a whole. He tacks one part to another, as his mi&s;guided fancy &s;ugge&s;ts: or, if he has any plan, it is &s;omething as unnatural, as the parts which compo&s;e it, are ab&s;urd. The deeper his pocket therefore, and the wider his &s;cale, his errors are more ap|parent.</P>
<P>To an injudicious per&s;on, or one who delights in temples, and Chine&s;e bridges, very little would appear executed in the &s;cenes I have de&s;cribed at Exbury. There is &s;carce a gravel-walk made: no pavilion rai&s;ed; nor even a white-&s;eat fixed. And yet in fact,
<PB N="188" REF="192">
more is done, than if all the&s;e decorations, and a hundred others, had been added, un|accompanied with what has been done. The greate&s;t difficulty of all is &s;urmounted&mdash;that of laying out a judicious plan. The re&s;t, tho the mo&s;t o&s;ten&s;ible, becau&s;e the mo&s;t expen&s;ive, is only a little mechanical fi|ni&s;hing.</P>
<P>From the&s;e plea&s;ing &s;cenes we pur&s;ued our journey through part of the beautiful ride we have ju&s;t de&s;cribed to Leap, along lanes clo&s;e on the left, but opening to the right in various places, to the river, which a&s;&s;umes a mag|nificent form. Need&s;ore-point makes here an appearance very different from what it made when we navigated the mouth of Beau|lieu-river<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 160.</NOTE>. It appears now from the higher grounds, when the tide is low, to run at lea&s;t a league into the &s;ea; flat, unadorned, and &s;kirted with drifted &s;and; making a &s;ingular feature in all the&s;e views; and the more &s;o, as every part of the ground in it's
<PB N="189" REF="193">
neighbourhood is woody, bold, and promi|nent. This penin&s;ula, of which Need&s;ore|point is the termination, belongs to the manor of Beaulieu. It contains &s;ome good land; con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of pa&s;turage; and the whole of it is let out in a &s;ingle farm.</P>
<P>In this remote part, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;ome|where near Exbury, the Dauphin, after his fruitle&s;s expedition to England, embarked privately on the death of king John, for France; burning the country behind him as he fled. His embarkation, from &s;o ob&s;cure a place, &s;hews, in a &s;trong light, how much his hopes were humbled.</P>
<P>At Leap we met the &s;ea, where the coa&s;t of the i&s;le of Wight, as far as to Spithead on the left, makes nearly the &s;ame unpic|ture&s;que appearance, which it does from the other &s;hores of the fore&s;t. It extends into length, and exhibits neither grandeur, nor variety. When it is &s;een, as we &s;aw it from Mr. Mitford's, broken into parts, as it &s;hould
<PB N="190" REF="194">
always be, when &s;een to picture&s;que advan|tage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 132.</NOTE>, it afforded &s;everal beautiful di&s;tances. But here, when the whole coa&s;t was di&s;played at once, it lo&s;t it's picture&s;que form.&mdash; Near Leap however we had one very beautiful coa&s;t-view. A ri&s;ing cop&s;e on the left, adorned with a road winding through it, makes a good fore-ground. From thence a promontory, in the &s;econd di&s;tance, with an ea&s;y, &s;weeping &s;hore, &s;hoots into the &s;ea; and is oppo&s;ed, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, by a point of the i&s;land, leaving a proper proportion of water to occupy the middle &s;pace.</P>
<P>Leap is one of the port-towns of the fore&s;t: and as it lies oppo&s;ite to Cowes, it is the common place of embarkation, in the&s;e parts, to the i&s;land. It con&s;i&s;ts of about half a dozen hou&s;es: and &s;helters perhaps as many fi&s;hing-boats. All the coa&s;t indeed from St. Helen's to the Needles, and around the i&s;land is in peaceable times, a &s;cene of fi&s;hing. In the whiting-&s;ea&s;on e&s;pecially, fleets of twenty or thirty boats are often &s;een lying at anchor on the banks; or a little out at &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB REF="195"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="196">Fowling too is practi&s;ed, on this coa&s;t, as much as fi&s;hing. Numerous flocks of wild-fowl frequent it, in the winter; widgeons, gee&s;e, and ducks: and in the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on e&s;pecially, as they bear a price in the country, they of cour&s;e attract the notice of the fowler. As the coa&s;t between Hamp&s;hire and the i&s;le of Wight is a peculiar &s;pecies of coa&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting, when the tide ebbs, of va&s;t muddy flats, covered with green &s;ea-weed, it gives the fowler an opportunity of practi&s;ing arts perhaps practi&s;ed no where el&s;e.</P>
<P>Fowling and fi&s;hing, indeed on this coa&s;t, are commonly the employments of the &s;ame per&s;on. He who in &s;ummer, with his line, or his net, plies the &s;hores, when they are overflowed by the tide; in winter, with his gun, as evening draws on, runs up, in his boat, among the little creeks, and crannies, which the tide leaves in the mud-lands; and there lies in patient expectation of his prey.</P>
<P>Sea-fowl commonly feed by night, when in all their multitudes they come down to graze on the &s;avannahs of the &s;hore. As the &s;ono|rous cloud advances, (for their noi&s;e in the air re&s;embles a pack of hounds in full cry) the attentive fowler li&s;tens, which way they bend
<PB N="192" REF="197">
their cour&s;e. Perhaps he has the mortification to hear them alight at too great a di&s;tance for his gun (tho of the longe&s;t barrel) to reach them. And if he cannot edge his boat a little round &s;ome winding creek, which it is not always in his power to do, he de&s;pairs of &s;ucce&s;s that night.&mdash;Perhaps however he is more fortunate, and has the &s;atisfaction to hear the airy noi&s;e approach nearer; till at length, the ho&s;t &s;ettles on &s;ome plain, on the edge of which his little boat lies moored. He now, as &s;ilently as po&s;&s;ible, primes both his pieces anew, (for he is generally double-armed) and li&s;tens with all his attention. It is &s;o dark that he can take no aim: for if he could &s;ee the birds, they al&s;o could &s;ee him; and being &s;hy, and timorous in a great degree, would &s;eek &s;ome other pa&s;ture. Though they march with mu&s;ic, they feed in &s;ilence. Some indi&s;tinct noi&s;es however, if the night be &s;till, i&s;&s;ue from &s;o large a ho&s;t. He directs his piece therefore, as well as he can, towards the &s;ound; gives his fire at a venture; and in&s;tantly catching up his other gun, gives a &s;econd di&s;charge, where he &s;uppo&s;es the flock to ri&s;e on the wing.&mdash;His gains for the night are now decided; and he has only to gather his harve&s;t.
<PB N="193" REF="198">
He immediately puts on his mud-pattens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mud-pattens are flat pieces of board, which the fowler ties to his feet, that he may not &s;ink in the mud.</NOTE>, ignorant yet of his &s;ucce&s;s, and goes groping about in the dark, happy if he have a little &s;tar-light, in que&s;t of his booty, picking up perhaps a dozen, and perhaps not one.&mdash;So hardly does the poor fowler earn a few &s;hil|lings; expo&s;ed, in an open boat, during a &s;olitary winter-night, to the weather as it comes, rain, hail, or &s;now, on a bleak coa&s;t, a league perhaps from the beach, and often in danger, without great care, of being fixed in the mud; where he would become an inevi|table prey to the returning tide. I have heard one of the&s;e poor fellows &s;ay, he never takes a dog with him on the&s;e expeditions, becau&s;e no dog could bear the cold, which he is obliged to &s;uffer.&mdash;After all, perhaps others enjoy more from his labours, than he him&s;elf does; for it often happens, that the tide, next day, throws, on different parts of the &s;hore, many of the birds, which he had killed, but could not find in the night.</P>
<P>I have heard of an unhappy fowler, whom this hazardous occupation led into a ca&s;e of
<PB N="194" REF="199">
&s;till greater di&s;tre&s;s. In the day time too it happened, which &s;hews the double danger of &s;uch expeditions in the night.&mdash;Mounted on his mud-pattens, he was traver&s;ing one of the&s;e mudland-plains in que&s;t of ducks; and being intent only on his game, he &s;uddenly found the waters, which had been brought forward with uncommon rapidity by &s;ome peculiar cir|cum&s;tance of tide, and current, had made an alarming progre&s;s around him. Incumbered as his feet were, he could not exert much expedition; but to whatever part he ran, he found him&s;elf compleatly inve&s;ted by the tide. In this uncomfortable &s;ituation, a thought &s;truck him, as the only hope of &s;afety. He retired to that part of the plain, which &s;eemed the highe&s;t from it's being yet uncovered by water; and &s;triking the barrel of his gun, (which for the purpo&s;e of &s;hooting wild-fowl was very long) deep into the mud, he re&s;olved to hold fa&s;t by it, as a &s;upport, as well as a &s;ecurity again&s;t the waves; and to wait the ebbing of the tide. A common tide, he had rea&s;on to believe, would not, in that place, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave reached above his middle: but as this was a &s;pring-tide, and brought in with &s;o &s;trong a current, he dur&s;t hardly expect &s;o
<PB N="195" REF="200">
favourable a conclu&s;ion.&mdash;In the mean time, the water making a rapid advance, had now reached him. It covered the ground, on which he &s;tood&mdash;it rippled over his feet&mdash;it gained his knees&mdash;his wai&s;t&mdash;button after but|ton was &s;wallowed up&mdash;till at length it advanced over his very &s;houlders. With a palpitating heart, he gave him&s;elf up for lo&s;t. Still however he held fa&s;t by his anchor. His eye was eagerly in &s;earch of &s;ome boat, which might accidentally take it's cour&s;e that way: but none appeared. A &s;olitary head, floating on the water, and that &s;ometimes covered by a wave, was no object to be de&s;cried from the &s;hore, at the di&s;tance of half a league: nor could he exert any &s;ounds of di&s;tre&s;s, that could be heard &s;o far.&mdash;While he was thus making up his mind, as the exigence would allow, to the terrors of &s;udden de&s;truction, his attention was called to a new object. He thought he &s;aw the uppermo&s;t button of his coat begin to appear. No mariner, floating on a wreck, could behold a cape at &s;ea, with greater tran&s;|port, than he did the uppermo&s;t button of his coat. But the fluctuation of the water was &s;uch, and the turn of the tide &s;o &s;low, that it was yet &s;ome time before he dur&s;t venture to
<PB N="196" REF="201">
a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf, that the button was fairly above the level of the flood. At length however a &s;econd button appearing at intervals, his &s;en&s;ations may rather be conceived, than de&s;cribed; and his joy gave him &s;pirits and re&s;olution, to &s;upport his unea&s;y &s;ituation four or five hours longer, till the waters had fully retired.</P>
<P>A little beyond Leap we were interrupted by a creek, which, when the tide flows high, runs con&s;iderably into the land, and forms a large piece of water. At all times it is an exten&s;ive mar&s;h. It's borders are edged with ru&s;hes, and &s;edges, which grow profu&s;ely al&s;o on various, little rough i&s;lands on it's &s;ur|face. Here the wild-duck, and the widgeon find many a delightful cover; amid&s;t which they breed, and rear their young, in great abundance.</P>
<P>Near this part of the coa&s;t &s;tands <HI>Lutterel's tower;</HI> built as the &s;tation of a view: but as it is intended for a habitable hou&s;e like|wi&s;e, the offices, which it could not contain,

are con&s;tructed of canvas around it. It is fini&s;hed in the highe&s;t &s;tile of expence; and if it were not for the oddne&s;s, and &s;ingu|larity of the conception, and contrivance, it is not intirely de&s;titute of &s;ome kind of ta&s;te. But the building is &s;o whim&s;ical, and the end &s;o inadequate to the expence, that we con&s;idered it, on the whole, as a glaring contra&s;t to tho&s;e plea&s;ing &s;cenes, we had ju&s;t examined at Exbury; in which true ta&s;te had furni&s;hed us with a delightful en|tertainment at a trifling expence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 186.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The view, which this tower commands over the <HI>circumjacent country,</HI> is very exten|&s;ive; but it's <HI>&s;ea-view</HI> is mo&s;t admired, &s;tretching from the bay of Southampton to Port&s;mouth&mdash;form thence to St. Helen's&mdash; and on the other &s;ide, all along the range of the i&s;le of Wight, and beyond the Needles to the ocean. The whole together forms the appearance of a magnificent bay; of which Spithead, and St. Helen's, (where there is commonly a fleet at anchor) make the central part.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="203">But this view, like the other <HI>exten&s;ive views</HI> we have &s;een, is by no means <HI>picture&s;que.</HI> It might have been &s;uppo&s;ed, that the i&s;le of Wight (on &s;urveying it's appearance in a map) would have made &s;uch an angle at Cowes-point, which is nearly oppo&s;ite to this tower, as would have thrown the ea&s;tern part of the i&s;land into better per&s;pective, than the we&s;tern a&s;&s;umes from any part of the Hamp&s;hire coa&s;t. And &s;o indeed in &s;ome degree it does. But the eye is at too great a di&s;tance to get much advantage from this circum&s;tance. If the &s;pectator were carried nearer Cowes, the coa&s;t towards St. Helen's might then fall away in good per&s;pective. But at this di&s;tance all is &s;ea; the coa&s;t is a mere thread; and the whole view together is without <HI>proportion.</HI></P>
<P>And yet it is not merely the di&s;proportion between land and water, which di&s;qualifies a view of this kind in a picture&s;que light. A picture&s;que view may con&s;i&s;t <HI>intirely of water.</HI>&mdash;Nor is it di&s;tance, which di&s;qua|lifies it. The mo&s;t remote di&s;tances are happily introduced on canvas. But what chiefly di&s;qualifies it, is the want of fore-ground to balance this va&s;t expan&s;e of di&s;tance.
<PB N="199" REF="204">
Unle&s;s di&s;tances and fore-grounds are in &s;ome degree, balanced, no compo&s;ition can be good. <HI>Fore-grounds</HI> are e&s;&s;ential to land&s;cape: <HI>di&s;tances</HI> are not.</P>
<P>A picture&s;que view, as was ob&s;erved, may con&s;i&s;t chiefly, indeed intirely, of water: but then, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that, as there cannot be a <HI>natural</HI> fore-ground, an <HI>artificial</HI> one mu&s;t be obtained&mdash;a group of &s;hips&mdash;a few boats with figures&mdash;a light-hou&s;e&mdash;or &s;ome|thing, that will make a balance between <HI>near</HI> and <HI>di&s;tant</HI> objects.

The whole area, con&s;tantly over&s;pread with ve&s;&s;els of various kinds, is a perpetual moving &s;cene: while the naked eye di&s;covers, in the di&s;tance, a thou&s;and objects; and through a tele&s;cope a thou&s;and more.

<P>About a mile from this whim&s;ical building &s;tands Cal&s;hot-ca&s;tle; &s;ituated like the ca&s;tle of Hur&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See p. 89.</NOTE>, on a tongue of land &s;hooting into the &s;ea.

They have a le&s;s exten&s;ive range to the we&s;t; but this is compen&s;ated by a full view up Southampton-bay. And they are the more picture&s;que, as the point of view is lower.</P>
<P>Near the village of Fawley, which is among the large&s;t villages of the coa&s;t, &s;tands Cadland, the &s;eat of Mr. Drummond; an edifice of a very different kind from that we had ju&s;t been &s;urveying. Tho quite plain, it is one of the mo&s;t elegant, and &s;eems to be one of the mo&s;t comfortable hou&s;es, in the country.</P>
<P>It &s;tands on a gentle eminence on the banks of Southampton-bay, with a great variety of ground playing beautifully around it; which is every where adorned, and in &s;ome places profu&s;ely covered, with ancient wood. The whole country indeed was &s;o well wooded, that no addition of wood was any where ne|ce&s;&s;ary; in many parts it was redundant. This abundance of old timber gives the hou&s;e, tho lately built, &s;o much the air and dignity of an ancient man&s;ion, that Mr. Brown, the ingenious improver of it, u&s;ed to &s;ay, "It
<PB N="203" REF="209">
was the olde&s;t new place he knew in England." The clumps particularly he has managed with great judgment. We ob&s;erved &s;ome combi|nations of a&s;h, and other trees, which were equal to any clumps we had ever &s;een. They adorned the natural &s;cene, and were ju&s;t &s;uch as the picture&s;que eye would wi&s;h to introduce in artificial land&s;cape. We regretted, that the great &s;torm in february 1781 had blown down nineteen of the&s;e ornamental trees. There &s;eemed however no deficiency; tho I doubt not, if we had known the &s;ituation of tho&s;e which had fallen, we &s;hould have found they filled their &s;tation with great propriety. The park includes a circuit of about five miles.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the beauty of the grounds them&s;elves around the hou&s;e; they command all the plea&s;ing di&s;tances in their neighbourhoood&mdash; Southampton-bay&mdash;Netly-abbey&mdash;Cal&s;hot-ca&s;|tle&mdash;Spithead&mdash;the channel&mdash;the i&s;le of Wight &mdash;St. Helen's&mdash;Cowes, and all the other con|&s;picuous parts of the i&s;land: and as many of the&s;e views are &s;een with the advantage of grand, woody fore-grounds, they have often an admirable effect.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="210">The only thing that appeared affected about this elegant man&s;ion, is the parade, which accompanies &s;ome of the appendant buildings. At the &s;mall di&s;tance of halt a quarter of a mile from the hou&s;e, &s;tands a mo&s;t &s;plendid farm. The &s;tables, the cow-&s;heds, the pi|geon-hou&s;e, the graneries, the barns, are all &s;uperb. In another direction the &s;ame honour, tho in an inferior degree, is paid to poultry. This is too much, and tends only to le&s;&s;en the dignity of the principal man&s;ion.</P>
<P>As the hor&s;e is &s;o nearly connected with his ma&s;ter, and contributes &s;o much to his &s;tate, and convenience, we allow &s;o noble an a&s;&s;ociate to lodge under a roof proportioned to his ma&s;ter's magnificence. As he is expec|ted al&s;o to be ready at a call, and may properly be the object of attention to per&s;ons of any rank, we allow his magnificent lodging to &s;tand near the man&s;ion, to which it appertains. At the &s;ame time, if the &s;tables be expen&s;ive, they &s;hould contribute to the magnificence of the <HI>whole,</HI> by making one of the wings, or &s;ome other proper appendage, of the pile.</P>
<P>But for the cow-&s;heds, and pig-&s;ties, they have no title to &s;uch notice. Let them be convenient, and neat; but let them be &s;imple,
<PB N="205" REF="211">
and unadorned. Let them &s;tand in &s;ome &s;e|que&s;tered place; where they may not pre&s;ume to vie with the man&s;ion they depend on; but keep a re&s;pectful di&s;tance. Herds of cattle are beautiful, in a high degree, in their proper place, among lawns and woods; but pent up, as they are obliged to be in yards, amid&s;t filth and litter, they are no objects of beauty. Neither &s;hould their habitations be con&s;idered as &s;uch. Ornaments here &s;erve only to call the attention to a nui&s;ance.</P>
<P>From Cadland we proceeded to Hethe through a variety of &s;uch beautiful country, that we almo&s;t thought the hou&s;e we had ju&s;t &s;een, might have been better &s;tationed el&s;e|where. In a variety of plea&s;ing &s;ituations it is difficult to &s;elect the be&s;t. Something or other may excel in each; and the eye, divided in it's choice, is unwilling to lo&s;e any thing. As we cannot however po&s;&s;e&s;s every beauty, and every convenience at once, we mu&s;t forego that idea; and endeavour to make &s;uch a &s;election, as will include the mo&s;t; tho per|haps &s;ome &s;triking beauty, which we ob&s;erve in other &s;ituations, is lo&s;t. This probably
<PB N="206" REF="212">
is the ca&s;e of the elegant man&s;ion we have been &s;urveying. No &s;ituation perhaps, on the whole, could have excelled it.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ing land&s;cape we met with between Cadland and Hethe, was of a &s;imilar kind to what we had already admired&mdash;great pro|fu&s;ion of full-grown oak, adorning great variety of playing ground. But what parti|cularly recommended the&s;e &s;cenes, were &s;everal dips, running down to Southampton-bay; wooded on each &s;ide, with a rich country beyond the water. They were of the &s;ame kind, with tho&s;e we admired between Chri&s;t-church, and Lymington<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 85.</NOTE>; but much richer, and more beautiful. Two of the mo&s;t &s;triking of the&s;e &s;cenes, were from Stobland-common, and near Butt's-a&s;h-farm.</P>
<P>At Hethe, the whole bay of Southampton opened in one view before us; but the &s;cene it offers, is far from being picture&s;que. The oppo&s;ite &s;hore is long, and tedious; and the lines of the bay run parallel: for tho in fact
<PB N="207" REF="213">
there are two or three bold openings in it, formed by the mouths of rivers; yet, in the di&s;tance, which is about a league, they are totally lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Hethe is the ferry-port to Southampton; which lies higher up in a diagonal acro&s;s the bay, and upon a neck of land, which &s;hoots into it. The flowing tide therefore carries the boat quickly to Southampton; and the ebbing tide returns it as expeditiou&s;ly to Hethe.</P>
<P>From Hethe to Dibden, the country, if po&s;|&s;ible, improves in beauty. The many inequa|lities of the ground&mdash;the profu&s;ion of &s;tately trees&mdash;the &s;heltered inclo&s;ures, appearing every where, like beautiful little wooded lawns&mdash;the catches, here and there, of the bay&mdash;and above all, the broad green, winding lanes, adorned with clumps &s;tanding out in various parts&mdash; exhibit a wonderful variety of plea&s;ing land|&s;cape. I touch <HI>general features</HI> only; for as the&s;e woodland &s;cenes are no where &s;trongly marked, it is impo&s;&s;ible to give any <HI>particular detail</HI> of them by verbal de&s;cription. One may &s;ay of them, as we &s;ometimes &s;ay of a
<PB N="208" REF="214">
well-written hi&s;tory, which runs into a variety of incidents, intere&s;ting indeed, but not replete with any important events; that no ju&s;t idea of the contents of it, can be given, without referring to the book it&s;elf.</P>
<P>From Dibden, we continued our rout northward, till we entered a beautiful fore&s;t lawn. We had found many of the&s;e &s;cenes in different parts, each of which had &s;ome|thing peculiar to it&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 147.</NOTE>. This too had it's peculiar character. It was about two miles in diameter. To the eye it's limits appeared circular; and it's form de&s;cending gently to a wide centre, had &s;ome re&s;emblance to that of a di&s;h. Yet it was far from a regular &s;cene. It's great beauty con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in it's noble &s;kreens of fore&s;t-wood; which growing every where around it with great irregularity, broke out into the &s;kirts of the area, not in clumps, which in &s;o large a &s;cene would have had little effect, but in corners of woods, adding variety to it's limits; yet without incroaching
<FIGURE>

<PB N="209" REF="216">
on the &s;implicity, and grandeur of the general idea. The name of this beautiful, and exten&s;ive fore&s;t-&s;cene is <HI>Hound's-down;</HI> &s;o named probably from the fair advantage it gives the hound in pur&s;uit. If he can drive his cha&s;e, from the thickets into this open plain, it is probable he will there &s;ecure him.</P>
<P>Through the middle of this wide down the Lyndhur&s;t road pa&s;&s;es to Southampton. The entrance into it, on the Lyndhur&s;t &s;ide, is beautiful; particularly between the ninth and tenth &s;tones, where the ground is finely diver&s;ified with tho&s;e woody promontories ju&s;t mentioned. As we approach the top of the hill towards Southampton, the beauty of the &s;cene is gone: the extremity is a naked, barren boundary. One advantage however we obtain from it, which is a di&s;tance; in fore&s;t-&s;cenery the more valuable, as the more uncommon. Di&s;tances are, at all times, an agreeable part of land&s;cape, and unite with <HI>every mode</HI> of compo&s;ition. Here it is intro|duced at fir&s;t in it's <HI>&s;imple&s;t mode.</HI> A plain fore-ground, without any ornament, is joined to a removed di&s;tance, without the intervention of any middle ground. In a compo&s;ition of this &s;imple kind it is nece&s;&s;ary to break the lines
<PB N="210" REF="217">
of the foreground; which may ea&s;ily be done by a tree, or a group of cattle.&mdash;As we ri&s;e to the verge of the eminence, the view inlarges it&s;elf. The grounds immediately be|low the eye, are over&s;pread with wood, and become a &s;econd di&s;tance; beyond which extends a remote one. Under a proper light this land&s;cape is calculated to produce a good effect. The parts are large; and if one va&s;t &s;hadow over&s;pread the woods on the nearer grounds, an inlightened di&s;tance would form a fine contra&s;t.</P>
<P>Hound's-down is one of the be&s;t pa&s;ture-grounds in the fore&s;t, at lea&s;t in patches; and is of cour&s;e frequented with cattle, which are a great addition to it's beauty. We rarely pa&s;s it in a &s;ummer-evening without &s;eeing herds of deer grazing in different parts; or fore&s;t-mares with their colts.</P>
<P>One thing indeed disfigures it; and that is the &s;trait cour&s;e of the road, which bi&s;ects it. The vi&s;ta, which leads through the fore&s;t from Brokenhur&s;t to Lyndhur&s;t, we ob&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 65.</NOTE>, was both great in it&s;elf, and accompanied with infinite variety; and therefore it became both
<PB N="211" REF="218">
a grand, and a beautiful object: but a &s;imple &s;trait road, like this, over a plain, has a dif|ferent effect. Tho in fact, it is <HI>grander</HI> than a winding road, as being more <HI>&s;imple,</HI> and con|&s;i&s;ting of <HI>fewer parts;</HI> yet as it is at be&s;t only a <HI>paltry object,</HI> and has not grandeur &s;ufficient to rou&s;e the imagination<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See this idea illu&s;trated page 122.</NOTE>, it is, on the whole, much le&s;s plea&s;ing, than a road playing before us in two or three large &s;weeps, which would at lea&s;t have had variety to recommend it; and might ea&s;ily have been contrived, without lengthening the journey acro&s;s it, on a trotting hor&s;e, above two minutes.&mdash;But in matters of this kind, in which &s;urveyors of high-roads are concerned, we expect beauty only by chance; and when we obtain it, it is &s;o much gain.</P>
<P>In our way to Hounds-down we rode pa&s;t a celebrated &s;pot, called the Deer-leap. Here a &s;tag was once &s;hot; which in the agony of death, collecting his force, gave a bound, which a&s;toni&s;hed tho&s;e who &s;aw it. It was immediately commemorated by two po&s;ts, which were fixed at the two extremities of
<PB N="212" REF="219">
the leap, where they &s;till remain. The &s;pace between them is &s;omewhat more than eighteen yards.</P>
<P>About half a mile on the right, as we leave Hounds-down, &s;tands Iron's-hill lodge. It occupies a knoll in the middle of a kind of natural, irregular vi&s;ta. In front the ground continues ri&s;ing gently about two miles to Lyndhur&s;t. The back-front overlooks a wild, woody &s;cene, into which the vi&s;ta impercep|tibly blends.</P>
<P>From Hound's-down we returned to Beau|lieu, along the we&s;tern &s;ide of that exten&s;ive heath, which, as I ob&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 178.</NOTE>, occupies the middle di&s;trict between the river of Beaulieu, and the bay of Southampton. In this part it con&s;i&s;ts of great variety of ground, and is adorned with little patches of wood &s;cattered about it; and as it is, in general, the highe&s;t ground in it's neighbourhood, it is not, like
<PB N="213" REF="220">
mo&s;t of the heaths we have &s;een, terminated by a woody &s;kreen, but by di&s;tances; which being commonly fore&s;t-&s;cenes, are picture&s;que, tho not exten&s;ive. Among the&s;e were &s;ome woody bottoms, on the right, which were plea&s;ing.</P>

This village &s;tands high; and the church, &s;tanding &s;till higher, is a land-mark round the country.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="222">Tho Lyndhur&s;t is but a &s;mall place, it may be called the capital of the fore&s;t. Here the fore&s;t-courts are held; and here &s;tands the principal lodge; which is known by the name of the <HI>King's-hou&s;e,</HI> and is the re&s;idence of the lord warden; tho it is but an ordinary building. An a&s;&s;ignment of timber was lately made to put it, and &s;ome other lodges, into better repair.</P>
<P>Behind the hou&s;e lies a plea&s;ant &s;loping field, containing about &s;ix or &s;even acres, which is planted round with &s;hrubs, circled by a gravel walk; and &s;ecured from cattle by a railed fence. I mention this <HI>mode</HI> of inclo&s;ure only becau&s;e I have often thought it a very good one, e&s;pecially if a field, like this, con&s;i&s;t of &s;loping ground: for the rails, which are in many parts hid, appear winding in others; and the eye is &s;eldom offended&mdash;&s;ometimes plea&s;ed with pur&s;uing them, and taking them up again, after they have for a while di&s;appeared. There is &s;ome|thing al&s;o not unplea&s;ing in the per&s;pective of winding rails.&mdash;I do not however men|tion a fence of this kind as &s;uitable to a regal man&s;ion; or &s;o proper in many ca&s;es as
<PB N="217" REF="223">
a &s;unk one: but only as a &s;imple, unaffected manner of inclo&s;ing a field near a plain, com|mon hou&s;e; and perhaps le&s;s offen&s;ive, than chains, wires, nets, or any of tho&s;e &s;light, unnatural fences, which <HI>cannot be hid,</HI> and yet <HI>appear</HI> &s;o di&s;proportioned. I &s;hould wi&s;h my rails however to be without ornament; and either to be left with their natural colour, or to be painted of &s;ome dingy olive-green hue: if they are of a bright-green, of a white, or of any other glaring colour, they di&s;gu&s;t. They are at be&s;t only <HI>di&s;agreeable conveniences:</HI> ornament makes them <HI>objects.</HI> But above all ornaments we are di&s;gu&s;ted with the Chine&s;e. That zig-zag work, commonly called Chine&s;e-railing, is very offen&s;ive. Plain, &s;imple po&s;ts, with one, two, or three rails, according to the &s;ort of cattle we wi&s;h to exclude, make the lea&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting fence.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to the royal lodge &s;tands a large &s;quare building, with a turret at each corner, where the king's hor&s;es, carriages, and &s;tag|hounds are kept.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="224">I do not find, that the royal lodge of Lyndhur&s;t has ever been vi&s;ited by the &s;overeign from the time of Charles II, till the year 1789, when George III pa&s;&s;ed through the fore&s;t in his road to Weymouth. So long a time had elap&s;ed, that all the etiquette of receiving a royal vi&s;itor was almo&s;t forgotten. When the day however of his arrival was notified, all the keepers, dre&s;&s;ed in new green uniforms, met him on hor&s;eback, at his en|trance into the fore&s;t. He travelled without guards; and was conducted by the&s;e fore&s;ters to Lyndhur&s;t. When he alighted from his coach, &s;ir Charles Mills pre&s;ented him with two white grey-hounds, by which ceremony he holds certain fore&s;t-privileges. His maje&s;ty, and the royal family (for the queen, and three of the prince&s;&s;es were with him) at fir&s;t dined in public, by throwing the windows open, and admitting the croud within the railed lawn: but as the populace became rather riotous in their joy, there was a nece&s;&s;ity to exclude them. The royal family however walked abroad in the fore&s;t every evening. The king &s;pent his mornings in riding: and
<PB N="219" REF="225">
as he rides fa&s;t, he &s;aw greate&s;t part of the fore&s;t; and &s;eemed &s;o much plea&s;ed with it, that he continued at Lyndhur&s;t (poorly as he was there accommodated) from thur&s;day the 25th of june, till the tue&s;day following.</P>
<P>Near Lyndhur&s;t &s;tands Cuffnells, the &s;eat of Mr. Ro&s;e. It is not placed exactly as might be wi&s;hed. High-ground ri&s;es imme|diately in front, which is always a circum|&s;tance to be avoided. But Mr. Ro&s;e has happily managed an inconvenience, which he found. He has laid out a very hand&s;ome approach, which winds to the hou&s;e under the ri&s;ing ground; and makes it of much le&s;s con&s;equence, than when the road was carried abruptly down the &s;lope to the hou&s;e. His improvements he has thrown to the back-front, where he is leading a very beautiful walk, through clumps of old oak winding towards Lyndhur&s;t. But his improvements are yet incomplete.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="226">Mr. Ballard al&s;o has a hou&s;e near Lynd|hur&s;t, which &s;tands high; and commands an exten&s;ive view. The king walked up to it, and with his gla&s;s continued &s;ome time examining the di&s;tant objects. He was &s;o plea&s;ed with it, that on leaving it, he gave it the name of Mount-royal.</P>
<P>From Lyndhur&s;t along the Rum&s;ey road, the fore&s;t opens beautifully, on the right, upon a lawn &s;welling in different parts, and &s;upported with wood at various di&s;tances. This lawn is u&s;ed as a race-ground, where the little hor&s;es of the fore&s;t, of which there is a mart at Lyndhur&s;t, are commonly brought to try their &s;trength, and agility.</P>
<P>That noble vi&s;ta, which we de&s;cribed after we left Brokenhur&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 65.</NOTE>, is interrupted by Lynd|hur&s;t; but commences again, on the other &s;ide of the town. Here however it is of little value. It is but ill adorned with wood. The
<PB N="221" REF="227">
trees, which are rare, &s;cathed, and meagre, are in general not only ugly, but ill-combined. Some formalities al&s;o give it a bad effect. Before, it was irregularly great, and &s;imple: here the road ri&s;es to the eye in three regular &s;tages. The &s;ummit too is formally abrupt. The road cut through the wood, forms here a gaping cha&s;m, opening like a wide portal, di&s;covering the naked horizon, and making, as it were, a full pau&s;e in the land&s;cape: we di&s;cover it plainly to be <HI>artificial;</HI> and this hurts the eye. The effect is beautiful on the other &s;ide of Lyndhur&s;t, where the cha&s;m of the vi&s;ta, as you approach, is filled with the tops of retiring trees, which excites the idea of &s;omething beyond it; and gives it a more natural air.</P>
<P>This gaping cha&s;m appears long the &s;triking feature of the view, as we ri&s;e the hill. In our approach to it however the eye is, here and there, agreeably drawn a&s;ide; particularly by a fore&s;t-lawn, which pre&s;ents it&s;elf about a mile, and a half from Lyndhur&s;t; opening both on the right and left. It is decorated irregularly with wood&mdash;ri&s;es before the eye&mdash; blends it&s;elf lei&s;urely with a few &s;cattered trees, and clumps, which come forward from
<PB N="222" REF="228">
the di&s;tant woods to meet it&mdash;and then lo&s;es it&s;elf imperceptibly in the depths of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>Somewhere in this part, between Lyndhur&s;t and Rum&s;ey, a charitable &s;cheme was projected in favour of a body of Palatines, who took refuge in England, in the reign of queen Anne; and engaged the humane part of the nation in endeavouring to provide means for their &s;upport. Many benevolent projects were formed; and among others this of &s;ettling them in New-fore&s;t: and the matter was thought &s;o practicable, that it was dige&s;ted into a regular plan; and laid before the lord trea&s;urer Godolphin.</P>
<P>The arrangement was this. A &s;quare plot of ground, containing four thou&s;and acres, was to be marked out, and equally divided into four parts, by two roads running through it, and cro&s;&s;ing at right angles, in the center. Each of the&s;e four parts was to be &s;ubdivided into five, &s;o that the whole plot might be pro|portioned into twenty farms; each of two hundred acres. This provi&s;ion of farms being made, twenty of the be&s;t, and mo&s;t re&s;pectable
<PB N="223" REF="229">
Palatine families were to be looked out, and put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them: the re&s;t were to be day-labourers. Each farmer was to be intru&s;ted with a capital of two hundred pounds; to be exempted from taxes for twenty years; and to have an a&s;&s;ignment of fore&s;t-timber, for building, and repairs.</P>
<P>This &s;cheme, which &s;eems to have been well-dige&s;ted, is &s;aid to have been fir&s;t hinted by the famous Daniel de Foe: but got no farther than the trea&s;urer's board&mdash;whether the &s;oil was thought incapable of being impro|ved; or whether it mi&s;carried from being the production of &s;o wild a genius, which made it &s;u&s;pected as chimerical.</P>
<P>We had now arrived at the &s;ummit of the vi&s;ta, which in pro&s;pect had appeared &s;o formal. On a clo&s;e approach, it's formality wore off; and we found our&s;elves &s;urrounded by beautiful &s;cenery. The &s;ummit it&s;elf is a fine wooded-knoll, ri&s;ing, on the left, and falling, on the right, into open groves.&mdash; As we de&s;cended the hill, on the other &s;ide, the clo&s;e-wooded &s;cenery &s;till continued beau|tiful,

<P>About a mile beyond the woody &s;ummit we had pa&s;&s;ed, we entered another fore&s;t-lawn, which tho very confined, has it's beauty; as all the&s;e openings mu&s;t have, however con|fined, if &s;urrounded with ancient wood. But about half a mile farther, where the Rom&s;ey, and Sali&s;bury roads divide, another fore&s;t-lawn of much larger dimen&s;ions, pre&s;ents it&s;elf. This is very &s;pacious, well hung with wood, and (what in all the&s;e &s;cenes adds greatly to their beauty) adorned in various parts with woody promontories &s;hooting into it; and
<PB N="228" REF="234">
clumps, and &s;ingle trees &s;cattered about it. On an eminence near this lawn, &s;tands a new hou&s;e, belonging to Mr. Gilbert.

<P>Not far from hence lies Paulton's, the &s;eat of Mr. Welbore Ellis.&mdash;Paulton's was one of the fir&s;t works of Mr. Brown; and there|fore de&s;erves the attention of the curious; tho in it&s;elf indeed it is a plea&s;ing &s;cene. The &s;ituation of the hou&s;e is that of an abbey; low, &s;heltered, and &s;eque&s;tered. It is contained within a paled boundary of about five miles in circumference: but the whole is &s;o woody, that the boundary is no where vi&s;ible. When Mr. Brown fir&s;t undertook this place, it was full of ancient timber; and nothing was wanting, but to open the area judiciou&s;ly into ample lawns, &s;creened with wood.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="235">A poli&s;hed &s;cene, like this, in the mid&s;t of a fore&s;t, addre&s;&s;es us with the air of novelty; and when natural, as this is, cannot fail to plea&s;e.

We enter them again with plea&s;ure; and &s;peak of them as we do of the works of a great literary genius, which contain greater beau|ties, tho perhaps blended with greater defects, than the laboured works of a le&s;s exalted, tho more correct writer.

Attempts of this kind &s;eldom an&s;wer: and the misfortune here is the more glaring, as a great, white, Chine&s;e bridge &s;tands every where in &s;ight to remind us of it.

only a fault it&s;elf; but led the eye to the detection of other faults.</P>
<P>From Paultons we entered an exten&s;ive tract of ri&s;ing ground, which bounds the fore&s;t on the north, along the borders of Wilt&s;hire; and &s;tretches on the left towards Fording-bridge, the river Avon, and the county of Dor&s;et. This &s;ide of the fore&s;t however is by much the narrowe&s;t. It's limits hardly extend from ea&s;t to we&s;t above four miles: whereas the boundary of the fore&s;t, in the &s;ame direction near the &s;ea, extends at lea&s;t fourteen.</P>
<P>This lofty plain, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of furze, and heath, as far as we &s;urveyed it, appeared in it&s;elf little adorned with any fore&s;t-fur|niture. The little wood in any part of it's area bore no proportion to it's extent. But it overlooked very grand views. In a picture&s;que light therefore we con&s;idered it as a va&s;t theatre, from whence we might view almo&s;t all the regions of the fore&s;t, which we had pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;Towards the north indeed, in &s;ome parts, it commands views
<PB N="231" REF="237">
into Wilt&s;hire; but the country is cultivated; and not removed enough to lo&s;e it's forma|lities. This part therefore may be con&s;idered only as a foil. The grand opening is towards the &s;outh. Here we found a &s;tation, which commanded a very noble view. The heath, making a gentle dip, pre&s;ents a va&s;t bay, which &s;preads the whole fore&s;t, in a manner, before the eye as far as the &s;ea, in one va&s;t expan&s;e of &s;cenery. Bramble-hill, one of the lodges, &s;tanding on a knoll, on the left, about half a mile below the eye, occupies one &s;ide of the opening into this immen&s;e woody di&s;tance, and another prominence, on which &s;tand the ruins of Ca&s;tle-Malwood, occupies the other. The &s;tation may ea&s;ily be found by this direction. Between the&s;e two pro|montories, the eye is conducted from wood, to wood, over lawns and heaths, through every &s;hade of per&s;pective, till all di&s;tinction at length is lo&s;t; and the eye doubts whether it is &s;till roving over the tufted woods of the fore&s;t; or is landed upon the di&s;tant &s;hores of the i&s;le of Wight; or is wandering among the hazy &s;treaks of the horizon. At lea&s;t it had that dubious appearance, when we &s;aw it. But it is one of the choice
<PB N="232" REF="238">
recommendations of the&s;e exten&s;ive &s;cenes, that they are &s;ubject to a thou&s;and varieties from the different modifications of the atmo&s;|phere.</P>
<P>A va&s;t &s;cene however, like this, is un|manageable as we have often ob&s;erved, tho it may be highly picture&s;que.&mdash;But our ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject may be car|ried farther, than we have yet carried them.</P>
<P>It is a common a&s;&s;ertion among land&s;cape-painters, that if the picture be ju&s;tly painted, an exten&s;ive di&s;tance in miniature will have the &s;ame effect on the mind of the &s;pectator, as if it were painted on the large&s;t &s;cale. Stand near a window, they tell you, and the whole may be brought within the circumference of a pane of gla&s;s. If then the &s;ame land|&s;cape <HI>were exactly painted</HI> on the pane of gla&s;s, it would have the &s;ame effect in a picture, which it has in nature.</P>
<P>This rea&s;oning, I fear, is fal&s;e. It depends intirely on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that we collect all our notices of external objects from the eye; agreeably to that con&s;truction of it, which
<PB N="233" REF="239">
the anatomi&s;t gives us. Whereas, in fact, the eye is a mere window. It is a pane of gla&s;s, through which the imagination is im|pre&s;&s;ed by the notices it receives of outward objects; which notices, tho &s;ometimes true, are often fal&s;e, particularly with regard to the &s;ize of objects; and will mi&s;lead it, unle&s;s corrected by experience. The mathematician talks of the angle of vi&s;ion; and demon&s;trates, that the &s;ize of the object in the eye mu&s;t be in exact proportion to that part of the cone of rays, which it intercepts: and it is on this &s;uppo&s;ition, the painter a&s;&s;erts, that an exten&s;ive di&s;tance, exactly painted, tho in miniature, will affect the &s;pectator like the natural &s;cene. But many things are mathe|matically true; tho experimently fal&s;e. Such is the famous puzzle of Achilles, and the tortoi&s;e. The mathematician demon&s;trates, that the tortoi&s;e <HI>mu&s;t</HI> win the race; tho not one jockey at Newmarket would bet on his &s;ide. Ju&s;t &s;o, the imagination revolts from the mathematical account of vi&s;ion. If I ex|amine, for in&s;tance, the height of that tree, by the &s;ide of a notched &s;tick, it is &s;carce an inch. But no mathematical proof can per|&s;wade me, that I <HI>&s;ee it under tho&s;e dimen&s;ions.</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="240">
I am well a&s;&s;ured, that the tree, not only <HI>is,</HI> but <HI>appears</HI> to me much larger.</P>
<P>If indeed my imagination could be &s;o far deceived, as to <HI>believe</HI> the land&s;cape, which is <HI>painted on a pane of gla&s;s,</HI> were really the land&s;cape <HI>tran&s;mitted through it;</HI> I might then &s;uppo&s;e it of the dimen&s;ions of nature. On no other &s;uppo&s;ition I can give it credit. But if a deceit of this kind could not ea&s;ily be practi&s;ed on a <HI>pane of gla&s;s;</HI> much le&s;s could it be practi&s;ed in a <HI>picture.</HI> We could never &s;o far impo&s;e upon our&s;elves, as to con|ceive a little object, of the dimen&s;ions of a foot by &s;ix inches, hung again&s;t a wall, can be a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of a country, twenty or thirty miles in extent.</P>
<P>I mean not to debate the &s;tructure of the eye with the philo&s;opher. All I mean to a&s;&s;ert, is, that the picture&s;que eye has nothing to do with tunics, iri&s;es, et retinas. It judges of nothing by a focus, or a cone of vi&s;pual rays. The imagination guided by experience pre&s;ides &s;olely over vi&s;ion, as far at lea&s;t as the bulk of objects is concerned; and it pic|tures them, not as painted on a mathematical point, but on an extended plain, and of their natural &s;ize. How nature manages this mat|ter,
<PB N="235" REF="241">
is beyond the painter's power to explain. The fact is certain: let the philo&s;opher, if he can, account for it.</P>
<P>To bring the argument to the point before us: there mu&s;t be <HI>real &s;pace</HI> to intere&s;t the imagination; and excite ideas of grandeur. In a <HI>picture,</HI> the imagination cannot be impo&s;ed upon. Two or three inches may give us the <HI>form</HI> of the land&s;cape; the proportion between the fore-ground, and the offskip; the hue of di&s;tance, and it's general appear|ance: and we may be plea&s;ed with the&s;e things even in miniature. But it is impo&s;&s;ible within &s;uch &s;canty limits to rai&s;e any of tho&s;e feelings, which land&s;cape in it's full dimen&s;ions will excite. Try the matter experimentally: ex|amine &s;uch a land&s;cape as this va&s;t, extended fore&s;t-view before us, alternately; fir&s;t with the <HI>naked eye,</HI> and then with a <HI>dimini&s;hing gla&s;s,</HI> (which at lea&s;t gives as ju&s;t a repre|&s;entation of the per&s;pective, and keeping of nature, as any artificial land&s;cape can do) and you will be convinced how much the idea lo&s;es under the latter experiment. At the &s;ame time, if &s;uch a di&s;tance as this, exten|&s;ive as it is, were painted on a <HI>larger &s;cale</HI> than common, and properly accompanied,
<PB N="236" REF="242">
and balanced with fore-ground; we might be tempted to forget it's under-&s;ize; and &s;eeing &s;o large a picture, might acknowledge &s;ome|thing like an equality with nature: we might be <HI>inclined to forget</HI> the deception, and might in <HI>&s;ome</HI> degree, <HI>feel</HI> tho&s;e &s;ublime ideas which nature it&s;elf excites.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this grand and exten&s;ive di&s;tance, which we &s;urveyed between Bramble-hill, and the ruins of Ca&s;tle-Malwood, we found many views of the &s;ame kind, as we traver&s;ed the high, and heathy grounds towards Fritham, and Fording-bridge. But the hills about Boldre-wood, and Lyndhur&s;t occupy the mid|dle &s;pace between the northern, and &s;outh|ern parts of the fore&s;t; and as they ri&s;e con&s;iderably, and intercept our views, the more we proceed in a we&s;tern direction, I know not, whether, on the whole, the view we have ju&s;t taken, is not one of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, and mo&s;t amu&s;ing, which the whole fore&s;t exhibits.&mdash;I cannot therefore conclude a de&s;cription of New-fore&s;t more properly, than with this grand exhibition, which in a manner, comprehends the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="243">As I have more than once however ob&s;erved, that &s;cenes of all kinds, and di&s;tances the mo&s;t of all, are &s;o diver&s;ified by the circum&s;tances, under which they are examined, that no &s;ingle view can give an adequate idea of them; I wi&s;h, before I &s;hut up the&s;e fore&s;t-&s;cenes, to add a fuller illu&s;tration of this great picture&s;que truth; which &s;hould always be in the recol|lection of every picture&s;que ob&s;erver of nature.

<P>Vicar's-hill is a knoll, falling gently, on the ea&s;t, to a grand woody bank, part of the wild grounds of &s;ir Harry Burrard&mdash;on the &s;outh, towards the channel, and the i&s;le of Wight&mdash;and on the we&s;t towards Lymington-river&mdash;all which it overlooks. As it &s;tands
<PB N="238" REF="244">
on the edge of the fore&s;t, the &s;ituation of it is nearly conformable to the wi&s;h of the poet:
<Q><L>&mdash; Be my retreat</L>
<L>Between the groaning fore&s;t, and the &s;hore,</L>
<L>A rural, &s;heltered, &s;olitary &s;cene<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomp&s;on's winter.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
The two la&s;t of the&s;e epithets indeed belong not to it. It &s;tands rather lofty, tho not high; and is &s;o far from being &s;olitary, that it enjoys a good neighbourhood.</P>
<P>From this knoll, the views are ingro&s;&s;ed by two hou&s;es, Mr. Cleavland's, and the vicar|age; the united plantations of which exclude the pro&s;pect from all other parts of the hill. From both the&s;e hou&s;es the views are beau|tiful; but they are of different kinds. Mr. Cleavland's &s;tanding on the we&s;t &s;ide of the knoll, has a view of Lymington-river, which forms one of it's be&s;t &s;weeps below his lawn. From hence the eye is carried along the river to it's opening into the channel; of which&mdash;together with the &s;hores around&mdash;the i&s;land beyond&mdash;and the town of Lymington&mdash; the di&s;tant land&s;cape is formed. The&s;e di&s;|tances
<PB N="239" REF="245">
are varied, as you view them from the upper, and lower parts of the lawn; and in general, as they are circum&s;cribed by the high lands, which bound the e&s;tuary, they are much more picture&s;que, and in the eye of a painter more beautiful, than tho&s;e va&s;t exten|&s;ive views of the i&s;land and channel, which we have &s;o often &s;een from various parts of the coa&s;t. We have had other occa&s;ions to remark the picture&s;que beauty of this e&s;tuary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 61, and 95.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As Mr. Cleavland's has a better view of the water, the vicarage has a better view of the woods. A hou&s;e built, where it could command both &s;cenes, would enjoy a grand &s;ituation. The view however is &s;o good, that it will bear a divi&s;ion; and yet each part form a whole. The vicarage &s;tands in the garden; clo&s;ed on every &s;ide, but the &s;outh, which is the a&s;pect of the be&s;t rooms. Before it is &s;pread a &s;mall lawn, proportioned to it's &s;ize. At the end of the lawn, which is al&s;o the boundary of the fore&s;t, is a &s;unk-fence; connecting it with the meadows beyond. The&s;e meadows declining to the &s;outh, and ea&s;t, form the brow of Vicar's-hill in tho&s;e
<PB N="240" REF="246">
directions; and are &s;creened by the grand woody bank, above-mentioned, wheeling gent|ly round, which &s;hapes the lower part of them into a &s;ort of &s;emi-circular valley. To the hanging woods of this very picture&s;que bank, a clo&s;e, de&s;cending walk from the hou&s;e, fol|lowing the direction of the fore&s;t-boundary, unites the garden.</P>
<P>The woody bank, which is the grand circum&s;tance of the view, having thus circled the meadows, falls away towards the e&s;tuary of the river; and becomes one of it's high inclo&s;ures. On the other &s;ide it is inter&s;ected by a ri&s;ing ground, on which &s;tands the town of Lymington at the di&s;tance of a mile<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the &s;ituation of Lymington de&s;cribed, page 94.</NOTE>. Over the dip, formed by this inter&s;ection, ri&s;es, as if fitted for the place, a lofty part of the i&s;le of Wight; from which a ridge of high land continues, pa&s;&s;ing over the town as a back-ground. Below the i&s;land appears a &s;mall catch of the channel: but the inter|vening woods of the ea&s;tern &s;creen have now almo&s;t intercepted it; interpo&s;ing one beau|tiful circum&s;tance in the room of another.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="247">Some of the chief modes of incidental beauty, which vary the&s;e few parts of land|&s;cape, are the&s;e.</P>
<P>In a morning the effect is often beautiful, when the &s;un ri&s;ing over the trees of the ea&s;tern bank, pours his &s;loping rays upon their tufted heads; while all the bottom of the valley, not yet having caught the &s;plendor, is du&s;ky, and ob&s;cure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an effect of this kind de&s;cribed more at length, Vol. I. p. 241.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The effect &s;till continues beautiful, as the &s;un ri&s;es higher. Some prominent part of the woody &s;creen always catches the light; while the rece&s;&s;es among the trees &s;till hold the depth of the morning-&s;hadow.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition of the land&s;cape is as well adapted to receive the effects of an evening, as of a morning-&s;un. As all the ea&s;tern &s;creen is richly, and picture&s;quely wooded, the illu|mination of the trees from the we&s;t is generally plea&s;ing; e&s;pecially as the meadows, de|&s;cending to the ea&s;t, and &s;outh, and of cour&s;e declining from the &s;ummer-&s;un, pre&s;ent large ma&s;&s;es of &s;hade.</P>

<P>In winter, the i&s;land is generally of an indi&s;tinct, grey hue: but in &s;ummer, when the evening-&s;un gets more to the north, it's declining ray &s;trikes the di&s;tant cliffs, and broken grounds of the i&s;land-&s;hores, and gives them a great re&s;plendency. As the&s;e broken grounds run behind the town, the effect of the chimnies, and hou&s;es, when &s;een in &s;hadow again&s;t the warm tints of the i&s;land-&s;hores, is often very picture&s;que; much more &s;o, than when the &s;un throws it's light upon them. And here we &s;ee exemplified a truth in land&s;cape, that the light breaks a town into parts&mdash;&s;hews it's poverty&mdash;and di&s;|&s;ipates it's effect: whereas all the parts of a town &s;een in &s;hadow, are blended together, and it becomes one grand object. I &s;peak however chiefly of towns in the &s;ituation of this, placed along the ridge of an eminence, and about a mile from the eye.

<P>But hazine&s;s, and mi&s;ts are here, as in other places, the great &s;ources of variety. In general, they have a good effect; but &s;ometimes a bad one. As the remote part of the land&s;cape, which con&s;i&s;ts of the i&s;le of Wight, does not immediately connect with the woods on one &s;ide, and the town of Lymington on the other, but is &s;eparated from them by the channel, which is about two, or three leagues acro&s;s, it of cour&s;e happens, that when a partial fog removes the i&s;land alone from the fight, a violent cha&s;m is left in the land&s;cape: there is no gradation; the ri&s;ing ground, on which Lymington &s;tands, appears &s;taring again&s;t a foggy &s;ky without any &s;upport of di&s;tance. Nothing can &s;hew more &s;trongly the u&s;e of di&s;tances, in com|pleating the harmony of a view.

It is the cha&s;m, which occa&s;ions the blank.

If the mi&s;t be more general, &s;o as to ob&s;cure not only the i&s;land, but the town al&s;o, and in proportion the nearer parts of the view, the effect is often beautiful. The woods of the ea&s;tern bank being ob&s;cured, the firs of the lawn &s;tanding much nearer, ri&s;e &s;trongly in oppo&s;ition: the eye is plea&s;ed with the contra&s;t; while the imagination is plea&s;ed al&s;o with diving into the ob&s;curity, and forming it's own objects.</P>
<P>The line al&s;o which the high grounds of the i&s;land form upon the &s;ky, is &s;ometimes &s;trong, and &s;ometimes faint; &s;ometimes al&s;o a part of it is broken, or intercepted by clouds, which gives a contra&s;t to the other part.</P>
<P>Again, the mi&s;t is &s;ometimes &s;o light, that it removes the i&s;land &s;everal leagues farther from the eye: yet &s;till the land&s;cape partaking of the <HI>general effect,</HI> pre&s;erves it's <HI>harmony.</HI></P>

<P>I omit mentioning here the variety, which the &s;ea&s;ons produce on this land&s;cape; tho as it is a woody &s;cene, the effect is often &s;ingu|larly beautiful, e&s;pecially in autumn.</P>

Every land&s;cape indeed hath &s;omething peculiar to it&s;elf, which di&s;po&s;es it more or le&s;s to receive the incidents of light, and weather in &s;ome peculiar manner.

<HEAD>SECT. XI. Of the animals, which frequent the fore&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus taken a view of the mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenes of the fore&s;t, it is la&s;tly proper to people them. No land&s;cape is complete without it's figures. I &s;hall make a few ob&s;ervations therefore on &s;uch animals, as frequent the fore&s;t; which the imagination of the reader may &s;catter about, as he plea&s;es, in the &s;everal &s;cenes, which have been pre&s;ented to him. The human inhabitants of the fore&s;t have already been mentioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 40.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="255">A diminutive breed of hor&s;es run wild in New-fore&s;t. In general however the hor&s;e is private property; tho &s;ometimes with difficulty a&s;certained. Numbers of people, who have lands in the neighbourhood of the fore&s;t, have a right of commoning in it; and mo&s;t of the cottagers, who border on it, a&s;&s;ume that right. Many of them have two or three mares; and &s;ome, who make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to breed colts, have droves.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e is gregarious. Herds of twenty, or thirty are often &s;een feeding together; in &s;ummer e&s;pecially, when they have plenty of pa&s;turage, and can live as they plea&s;e. In winter they are obliged to &s;eparate, and &s;eek their food, as they can find it. In general indeed they are left, in all &s;ea&s;ons, to take their chance in the fore&s;t. Where there is no expence, there can be no great lo&s;s; and what is &s;aved, is &s;o much gained. In mar&s;hy parts a &s;evere winter often goes hardly with them. But in dry grounds, where heath and furze abound, they pick up a tolerable win|ter-&s;ub&s;i&s;tence; e&s;pecially if they have learned the little arts of living, which nece&s;&s;ity teaches.
<PB N="251" REF="256">
Of the&s;e arts, one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful is to brui&s;e, and pound with their fore-feet, the prickly tops of furze. This operation, which I have often &s;een performed, prepares the rigid diet of a furze-bu&s;h in &s;ome degree for ma&s;tication; and renders it rather le&s;s offen&s;ive to the palate</P>
<P>When &s;uch colts, as have long run wild, are to be caught for &s;ale, their ideas of liberty are &s;o unconfined, from pa&s;turing in &s;o wild a range, that it is matter of no little difficulty to take them. Sometimes they are caught by &s;light of hand, with a rope and a noo&s;e. But if this method fail, they are commonly hunted down by hor&s;e-men, who relieve each other. Colt-hunting is a common prac|tice in the fore&s;t.&mdash;The colts which feed on Obergreen, are &s;ometimes taken by the following &s;tratagem. In this part runs a long bog, de&s;cribed, under the name of Long|flade-bottom; which is cro&s;&s;ed by a mole, thrown over it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 124.</NOTE>. With this pa&s;&s;age the colt is well acquainted; and on being pur&s;ued, is ea&s;ily driven towards it. When he is about
<PB N="252" REF="257">
the middle of the mole, two or three men &s;tart up in front, and oblige him to leap into the bog, where he is intangled, and &s;eized.</P>
<P>At all the neighbouring fairs, the&s;e hor&s;es are a principal commodity, and are bought up for every purpo&s;e, to which a hor&s;e can be applied. Diminutive as they are, you may often &s;ee half a dozen of them &s;training in a waggon: and as it is fa&s;hionable to drive them in light carriages, their price has been inhanced. It is a little fortune to a poor cottager, if he happen to po&s;&s;e&s;s three or four colts, that are tolerably hand&s;ome, and match well. He may probably &s;ell them for ten, or twelve pounds a piece.</P>
<P>In point of value, the New-fore&s;t hor&s;e would ri&s;e higher, if the &s;ame care were taken in breeding him, which was formerly taken<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Manwood on fore&s;t-law, page 29.</NOTE>; and which is &s;till in &s;ome degree, taken in the neighbouring fore&s;t of Bere; where, I have heard, the keepers are ordered to de&s;troy all hor&s;es, which, at three years of age, are
<PB N="253" REF="258">
under thirteen hands; and all mates under twelve.</P>
<P>There is another evil likewi&s;e, which tends to injure the fore&s;t-colt; and that is, put|ting him to bu&s;ine&s;s at too early an age. Tho a &s;mall hor&s;e attains maturity earlier, than a large one; yet the&s;e hor&s;es, bred chiefly by indigent people, and generally of little value, are introduced much &s;ooner to labour, than abler, and better hor&s;es commonly are.</P>
<P>The fame, and exploits are &s;till remembred of a little beautiful, grey hor&s;e, which had been &s;uffered to run wild in the fore&s;t, till he was eight years of age; when he had at|tained his full &s;trength. His fir&s;t &s;en&s;ations, on the lo&s;s of his liberty, were like tho&s;e of a wild-bea&s;t. He flew at his keeper with his open mouth; or rearing on his hind|legs, darted his fore-feet at him with the mo&s;t malicious fury. He fell however into hands, that tamed him. He became by de|grees patient of the bit, and at length &s;uffered a rider. From this time his life was a &s;cene of glory. He was well known on every road in the county; was the favorite of every groom; and the con&s;tant theme of every
<PB N="254" REF="259">
o&s;tler. But in the cha&s;e his prowe&s;s was mo&s;t &s;hewn. There he carried his ma&s;ter, with &s;o much &s;wiftne&s;s, ea&s;e, and firmne&s;s, that he always attracted the eyes of the company, more than the game they pur|&s;ued.</P>
<P>The New-fore&s;t hor&s;e is often &s;uppo&s;ed to be of Spani&s;h extraction; from ance&s;tors, imagined to have been &s;hip-wrecked on the coa&s;t of Hamp&s;hire, in the time of the armada. But I look on this as a &s;pecies of the ancient vaunt, <HI>genus a Jove &s;ummo;</HI> and to de&s;erve as little attention. Some of them have a form, which would not di&s;grace &s;o noble a lineage. The grey hor&s;e repre&s;ented in the annexed plate, is among the mo&s;t beautiful. But in general, the croup of the fore&s;t-hor&s;e is low; and his head ill-&s;et on, having what the jockies call a <HI>&s;tiff jaw.</HI> Of this defect a re&s;emblance is given in the hor&s;e on the left, who&s;e head is &s;et on, as tho&s;e of the fore&s;t-hor&s;es commonly are. Their claim therefore to high lineage mu&s;t in general re&s;t more on their good qualities, than on their beauty&mdash;on the hardine&s;s of their nature&mdash; on their uncommon &s;trength&mdash;on their agility,

<PB N="255" REF="261">
and &s;urene&s;s of foot, which they probably acquire by con&s;tantly lifting their legs among furze.</P>
<P>But tho the form of the New-fore&s;t hor&s;e is &s;eldom beautiful; yet as the ornament of a fore&s;t &s;cene, he is very picture&s;que. The hor&s;e, in his natural &s;tate, rough with all his mane about him, and his tail waving in the wind, as he feeds, is always beautiful; but particularly in &s;o wild a &s;cene as this, which he graces exceedingly.</P>
<P>On this &s;ubject I cannot forbear digre&s;&s;ing a little, (and I hope the critical reader will not be too fa&s;tidious,) on the great indignity the hor&s;e &s;uffers from the mutilation of his tail, and ears. Within this century, I believe, the barbarous cu&s;tom of docking hor&s;es came in u&s;e; and hath pa&s;&s;ed through various mo|difications, like all other cu&s;toms, which are not founded in nature, and truth. A few years ago the <HI>&s;hort dock</HI> was the only <HI>tail</HI> (if it may be called &s;uch) in fa&s;hion, both in the army, and in carriages. The ab&s;urdity how|ever of this total amputation began to appear. The gentlemen of the army led the way.
<PB N="256" REF="262">
They acknowledged the beauty, and u&s;e of the tail, as nature made it. The <HI>&s;hort dock</HI> every where di&s;appeared; and all dragoon-hor&s;es paraded with long tails.</P>
<P>The <HI>nag-tail</HI> however &s;till continued in u&s;e. Of this there are &s;everal &s;pecies, all more or le&s;s mutilated. The mo&s;t deformed one is <HI>nicked-tail;</HI> &s;o named from a cruel operation u&s;ed in forming it. The under &s;inews of the dock being divided, the tail &s;tarts upwards, directly contrary to the po&s;ition, which nature intended. The nag-tail is &s;till &s;een in all genteel carriages. Nor will any per&s;on of fa&s;hion ride a hor&s;e without one. Even the gentlemen of the army, who have &s;hewn the mo&s;t &s;en&s;e in the affair of hor&s;e-tails, have been &s;o mi&s;led, as to introduce the nag-tail into the light-hor&s;e; tho it would be as dif|ficult to give a rea&s;on now for the <HI>nag-tail,</HI> as formerly for the <HI>&s;hort-dock.</HI></P>
<P>Two things are urged in defence of this cruel mutilation&mdash;the <HI>utility,</HI> and the <HI>beauty</HI> of it. Let us briefly as po&s;&s;ible, examine both.</P>
<P>To make an animal <HI>u&s;eful</HI> is, no doubt, the fir&s;t con&s;ideration: and to make a hor&s;e &s;o, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily make him &s;uffer &s;ome

things, which are <HI>unnatural,</HI> becau&s;e we take him out of a <HI>&s;tate of nature.</HI> He mu&s;t be fed with hay, and corn in the winter, which he cannot get in his open pa&s;tures: for if he have exerci&s;e <HI>beyond nature,</HI> he mu&s;t have &s;uch food, as will enable him to bear it. As it is nece&s;&s;ary likewi&s;e to make our roads hard, and durable, it is nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o to give the hor&s;e an iron hoof, that he may travel over them without injuring his feet.&mdash;But all this has nothing to do with his <HI>tail,</HI> from which <HI>no incumbrance</HI> ari&s;es.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ays the advocate for <HI>docking;</HI> as it is nece&s;&s;ary for the hor&s;e to travel, to hunt, and to race, it is u&s;eful to lighten him of of every incumbrance. And as it is nece&s;&s;ary for him to travel through dirty roads; it is u&s;eful to rid him of an in&s;trument, which is continually collecting dirt, and la&s;hing it over him&s;elf, and his rider.</P>
<P>To ea&s;e your hor&s;e of every incumbrance in travelling, is certainly right. You &s;hould &s;ee that his bridle, and &s;addle, (which are his great incumbrances) are as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible: and that the weight he carries, or draws, be proportioned to his &s;trength. But depend upon it, he receives no incumbrance from nature.
<PB N="258" REF="265">
It is a maxim among all true philo&s;ophers, that <HI>nature has given nothing in vain:</HI> and there can be no rea&s;onable doubt, but that nature has given the hor&s;e his tail to balance, and a&s;&s;i&s;t his motions. That this is the ca&s;e, &s;eems plain from the u&s;e he makes of it. When the animal is at re&s;t, his tail is pendent: but when he is in violent action; he rai&s;es, and &s;preads it, as a bird does in the &s;ame &s;ituation. Would the &s;wallow, or the dove be a&s;&s;i&s;ted in their flight by the lo&s;s of their tails? or the greyhound in his &s;peed by dock|ing him? For my&s;elf, I have no doubt, but if the experiment were tried at New|market, which I &s;uppo&s;e it never was, the hor&s;e with his long tail, however the literati there might laugh at him, would not be in the lea&s;t injured in his &s;peed; and would certainly an&s;wer better, in all his &s;udden turns, to the intention of his rider. He would ex|tend, and &s;pread his helm: it would &s;teer his way; and we &s;hould &s;eldom hear of his running out of his cour&s;e, or on the wrong &s;ide of the po&s;t.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, his tail probably a&s;&s;i&s;ts him even in his common exertions; and balances his body, when he trots, and prevents his &s;tum|bling.
<PB N="259" REF="266">
I have heard a gentleman, who had travelled much in the ea&s;t, remark, that the Turki&s;h, and Arabian hor&s;es rarely &s;tumble; which he attributed, and with much appear|ance of truth, to their long tails.</P>
<P>But whatever u&s;e the tail may be to the nor&s;e <HI>in action,</HI> it is acknowledged on all hands to be of infinite u&s;e to him, <HI>at re&s;t.</HI> Whoever &s;ees the hor&s;e grazing in &s;ummer, and ob&s;erves the con&s;tant u&s;e he makes of his long tail in la&s;hing the flies from his &s;ides, mu&s;t be per&s;uaded, that it is a mo&s;t u&s;eful in&s;trument: and mu&s;t be hurt to &s;ee him fidget a &s;hort dock, back, and forward, with ineffectual attempts to rid him&s;elf of &s;ome plague, which he cannot reach.</P>
<P>As to the objection again&s;t the tail, as an in&s;trument, which is continually <HI>gathering dirt,</HI> and <HI>la&s;hing</HI> it around, if there be any truth in what I have already ob&s;erved, this little objection di&s;&s;olves it&s;elf; e&s;pecially as the inconvenience may with great ea&s;e be remedied, when the road is dirty, either by knotting up the tail, or by tying it with a leathern-&s;trap.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="267">But whatever becomes of <HI>utility,</HI> the hor&s;e is certainly more <HI>beautiful,</HI> we are told, without his dangling tail.

It is thus in other things. From nature alone we have the form of a hor&s;e. Should we then &s;eek for beauty in that object, in our own wild conceptions; or recur to the great original, from whence we had it?

For my&s;elf, I cannot con|ceive, why it &s;hould make a hor&s;e more beautiful to take his tail from him, than it

The four equal legs of every animal are it's greate&s;t de|formity; and their &s;amene&s;s of cour&s;e gives the painter the mo&s;t trouble in the management of them. In many of her forms indeed, where nature does not &s;eem to aim at beauty, &s;he neglects this economy: but as if &s;he meant the hor&s;e for one of her mo&s;t elegant produc|tions, &s;he has provided for him in this re&s;pect al&s;o, by giving him a graceful flow of hair, which hiding &s;ometimes one leg, and &s;ome|times another, introduces a plea&s;ing contra&s;t among them all.&mdash;The accidental motion al&s;o of the tail gives it peculiar beauty; both when the hor&s;e moves it him&s;elf; and when it waves in the wind. The beauty of it indeed to an unprejudiced eye is con&s;picuous at once;

and in all parade, and &s;tate-hor&s;es it is acknow|ledged: tho even here there is an attempt made to improve nature by art: the hair mu&s;t be adorned with ribbons; and the bottom of the tail clipped &s;quare, which adds heavine&s;s, and is certainly &s;o far a deformity.</P>
<P>The captain of an Engli&s;h man of war gave me an account &s;ometime ago, of his landing in one of the piratical &s;tates of Barbary, while his &s;hip anchored in the bay.

<P>I &s;hall conclude my remarks on this cruel mutilation, with an epigram by Voltaire.&mdash; That celebrated wit was in England about the time, when the babarous cu&s;tom of docking hor&s;es was in high fa&s;hion. He was &s;o &s;hocked at it, that he wrote the following ver&s;es, which, it is &s;aid, he gave to lord Lyttelton.</P>
<Q><L>Vous, fiers Anglois, et barbares que vous &ecirc;tes,</L>
<L>Coupent les tates a vos rois, et les queues a vos b&ecirc;tes.</L>
<L>Mais les Fran&ccedil;cois plus polis, et aimant les loix,</L>
<L>Lai&s;&s;ent les queues a leurs b&ecirc;tes, et les t&acirc;tes a leurs rois.</L></Q>
<P>There is more indignation, than wit, I think, in the&s;e ver&s;es. Voltaire &s;eems to con|&s;ider docking a hor&s;e, and killing a king, as equal crimes; which however is carrying the matter &s;omewhat farther, than the picture&s;que eye wi&s;hes to carry it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ab&s;urd notions, which have led men to cut off the tails of hor&s;es, have led them al&s;o to cut off their ears. I &s;peak not

of low grooms, and jockies; we have lately &s;een the &s;tuds of men of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion, mi&s;led probably by grooms, and jockies, pro|ducing only cropt-hor&s;es.</P>
<P>When a fine hor&s;e has wide, lopping ears, as he &s;ometimes has, without &s;pring, or motion in them; a man may be tempted to remove the deformity. But to cut a pair of <HI>fine ears</HI> out of the head of a hor&s;e, is, if po&s;|&s;ible, a &s;till greater ab&s;urdity, than to cut off his tail. Nothing can be alledged in it's defence. The ear neither retards motion; nor flings dirt.</P>
<P>Much of the &s;ame ground may be gone over on this &s;ubject, which we went over on the la&s;t. With regard to the <HI>utility</HI> of the ear, it is not improbable, that cropping it may injure the hor&s;e's hearing: there is certainly le&s;s concave &s;urface to receive the vibrations of the air.&mdash;I have heard it al&s;o a&s;&s;erted with great confidence, that this mutilation injures his health: for when a hor&s;e has lo&s;t that pent-hou&s;e, which nature has given him over his ear, it is rea&s;onable to believe the wind, and rain may get in, and give him cold.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e injuries are not ea&s;ily proved, the injury he receives in point of <HI>beauty</HI> may

&s;trenuou&s;ly be in&s;i&s;ted on. Few of the minu|ter parts of animal nature are more beautiful, than the ear of a hor&s;e, when it is neatly formed, and well &s;et on.&mdash;The contra&s;t of the lines is plea&s;ing; the concavity, and the convexity, being generally &s;een together in the natural turn of the ear.&mdash;Nor is the proportion of the ear le&s;s plea&s;ing. It is contracted at the in&s;ertion, &s;wells in the middle, and tapers to a point. The ear of no animal is &s;o beautifully proportioned. That of &s;ome bea&s;ts, e&s;pecially of the &s;avage kinds, as the lion, and pard, is naturally rounded, and has little form. The ears of other animals, as the fox, and cat, are pointed, &s;hort, and thick. Tho&s;e of the cow are round, and heavy. The hare's, and a&s;s's ears are long, and nearly of the &s;ame thickne&s;s. The dog, and &s;wine have flapping ears. The &s;heep, alone has ears, that can compare with the hor&s;e.&mdash;The ear of the hor&s;e receives great beauty al&s;o from it's colour, as well as form. The ears of bay, and grey hor&s;es are generally tipped with black, which melts into the colour of the head.&mdash;But the ear of the hor&s;e receives it's greate&s;t beauty from motion.

inferior indeed in dignity; but &s;uperior in picture&s;que beauty; I mean the a&s;s. Among all the tribes of animals, &s;carce one is more ornamental in land&s;cape.

The ob&s;ervation however is undoudtedly true; and every picture&s;que eye will acknowledge it. Berghem bears full te&s;timony to it's truth. In his pictures the a&s;s makes often the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed figure: and a late excellent land&s;cape-painter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gain&s;borough.</NOTE>, I have heard, generally kept this animal by him, that he might have it always at hand to introduce in various attitudes, into his pic|tures.

<P>One rea&s;on indeed for repleni&s;hing the fore&s;t &s;o much with a&s;&s;es, is the propagation of

<P>The mule is by no means &s;o picture&s;que an animal as the a&s;s; and is rarely introduced in land&s;cape; chiefly, I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e he has not &s;o determined a character. He is neither a hor&s;e, nor an a&s;s, and yet has a re&s;emblance to both. To make an object truly picture&s;que, it &s;hould be marked &s;trongly with &s;ome peculiar character.&mdash;Be&s;ides, the mule varies in form, as much from him&s;elf, as he does either from the hor&s;e, or the a&s;s. He follows his &s;ire. A mule bred from an Arabian, differs as much from the offspring of a fore&s;ter, as the two &s;ires them&s;elves. This al&s;o injures his picture&s;que character. &mdash;The mule, from which the annexed drawing was taken, was a mule of blood. The a&s;s al&s;o varies from it&s;elf; but not &s;o much as the mule.

<P>But of all animals, with which the fore&s;t abounds, the &s;tag is in a peculiar manner adapted to it's &s;cenes. The wildne&s;s of his nature harmonizes with them; and the beauty

<P>But here perhaps the advocate for docking hor&s;es will glory in the &s;hort tail of the &s;tag. He has no rea&s;on. There is no doubt, nature has provided for the exigences of the &s;tag in his &s;peed, as well as for tho&s;e of the hor&s;e. It is true, the &s;hortne&s;s of the tail in &s;o beau|tiful an animal, rather <HI>&s;eems</HI> a defect. But as, in the language of religion, the well-ordered mind acknowledges every thing right in the works of God&mdash;&s;o, in the language of painting, the picture&s;que eye acknowledges every thing beautiful in the works of nature. Some objects indeed may plea&s;e le&s;s than others; and be le&s;s accommodated to the rules of painting. But all objects are be&s;t as nature made them. Art cannot mend them.

<P>The &s;tag, during his fir&s;t year is called a <HI>calf;</HI> and does not a&s;&s;ume the name of a <HI>&s;tag</HI> till his fifth; being known in the intermediate years, by certain tecknical names, which none but fore&s;ters can remember. In his &s;ixth year he takes the re&s;pectable title of a <HI>hart.</HI> Some authors have given it to his fifth: but I follow the authority of Manwood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Manwood, page 99.</NOTE>.&mdash;Be&s;ides this title, he may &s;till attain two higher degrees of honour; tho&s;e of a <HI>hart-royal,</HI> and of a <HI>hart-royal proclaimed.</HI></P>
<P>If he be hunted by the king, and e&s;cape; or have his life given him for the &s;port he has afforded, he becomes from thence forward, a <HI>hart-royal.</HI>&mdash;If he be hunted out of the fore&s;t, and there e&s;cape; the king hath &s;ometimes honoured him with a royal pro|clamation; the purport of which is, to for|bid any one to mole&s;t him, that he may have free liberty of returning to his fore&s;t.
<PB N="274" REF="285">
From that time he becomes a <HI>hart-royal pro|claimed.</HI>&mdash;Manwood mentions a fact of this kind, which he found on record, in the ca&s;tle of Nottingham. It is dated in the time of Richard the fir&s;t, who having rou&s;ed a hart in Sherwood-fore&s;t, pur&s;ued him as far as Barn&s;dale in York&s;hire; where the hart foiled, and e&s;caped his hounds.

<P>In general, the &s;tag is a harmle&s;s, inoffen&s;ive animal. At one &s;ea&s;on only, when he is en|gaged in his &s;eraglio, he is fierce. You hear him roaring, and bellowing, at that time, about the fore&s;t; meditating revenge on his rival, whom he meets, head to head, and foot to foot. While he is able with his antlers to parry the attack, he &s;tands his ground: and if he happen to be of equal prowe&s;s with his rival, the conflict is ob&s;tinate. But a weak adver&s;ary &s;oon feels the &s;trength of his opponent. He cannot re&s;i&s;t his pu&s;h. His flanks give way; and he is pre&s;ently driven off the field.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="288">At the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons of riot the &s;tag is &s;aid to be dangerous. If therefore in pa&s;&s;ing through the fore&s;t, you &s;ee him at a di&s;tance in your path, you had better avoid him by turning a little to the right, or left. If you do not approach, he will not pur&s;ue. I have heard old fore&s;ters however &s;ay, they did not re|member an in&s;tance of his ever doing vo|luntary mi&s;chief at any time; and a&s;&s;ert that he will always avoid the pa&s;&s;enger, if he can.</P>
<P>But it is on all hands agreed, that he is highly dangerous, when hard pre&s;&s;ed by the hounds, and driven to extremity. When the cha&s;e is well nigh over&mdash;when that ela&s;tic vigour, with which at fir&s;t he bounded along the plain, is changed into a heavy gallop&mdash; when his mouth becomes black and dry&mdash; his tongue hanging from it&mdash;and his eye marked with horror and di&s;may, (cruel, &s;urely, to turn &s;uch agony into &s;port!) his reverence for man is gone: he is driven to de&s;pair; and all his powers are collected into terror and undi&s;tingui&s;hing fury.</P>
<P>Some years ago, a &s;tag in New-fore&s;t, pre&s;&s;ed by the hunters, and ju&s;t entering a thicket, was oppo&s;ed by a pea&s;ant; who
<PB N="277" REF="289">
fooli&s;hly, with his arms extended, attempted to turn him. The &s;tag held his cour&s;e, and darting one of his antlers into the man, carried him off &s;ome paces, &s;ticking upon his horn. The man was immediately conveyed to Lymington, where he lay dangerou&s;ly ill for &s;ome time; but at length recovered. I have heard al&s;o, that when the duke of Bedford was lord-warden of the fore&s;t, his hunt&s;man had a hor&s;e killed under him by a &s;tag, which he cro&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame imprudent manner.</P>
<P>We have a beautiful de&s;cription in Shake|&s;pear, which I cannot forbear introducing, both for the &s;ake of the picture; and for the knowledge it conveys. The &s;orrows of the dying &s;tag&mdash;his &s;ighs; his tears; and the unfriendly return his di&s;tre&s;&s;es find from all his former companions, are circum&s;tances in his hi&s;tory well-known to the naturali&s;t, the fore&s;ter, and the hunt&s;man.

<P>As it is now many years &s;ince New-fore&s;t has been a &s;cene of royal-diver&s;ion, the breed of &s;tags is generally dimini&s;hed. It is a rare thing now to meet them in the &s;outhern parts of it; tho within the memory of man, they were &s;o numerous, that I have heard an old fore&s;ter, pointing to the &s;ide of a hill, on Beaulieu heath, &s;ay, he had &s;een them lying there in herds, like cows, and hor&s;es. There are &s;till however many in the northern parts of the fore&s;t, particularly about Boldre-wood, and Burley-lodges; but, in general, the fal|low deer are more encouraged.</P>

<P><PB N="279" REF="292">The &s;tag might ea&s;ily be trained, like the rein-deer of Lapland, to draw a carriage, if we had not animals more proper for the purpo&s;e.

<P>The fallow-deer is much more limited by nature in the place of his abode; and in this i&s;land particularly has been received only by importation. He is &s;uppo&s;ed to have but two varieties, the &s;potted, and the dark|brown. The former is of Indian extraction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Pennant's Zool.</NOTE>: the latter was brought from Denmark by James I.

<PB N="280" REF="293">
The latter is the more picture&s;que animal. The uniform &s;pot of the variegated deer is not &s;o plea&s;ing, as one &s;imple brown-tint, melting away by degrees into a &s;ofter hue, which pro|duces a &s;ort of natural light and &s;hade; as indeed all colours do, which blend gently into each other.</P>

When he di&s;tributes his dole, he commonly makes a hollowing noi&s;e to call his di&s;per&s;ed family together. In calm &s;ummer-evenings, if you frequent any part of the fore&s;t near a lodge, you will hear this hollowing noi&s;e re&s;ounding through the woods; and if you are not appri&s;ed of it, you will be apt to wonder, each evening, at it's periodical exactne&s;s.</P>

<P>Mr. Pennant tell us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Brit. Zool.</NOTE>, that in Germany the pea&s;ants frequently watch their corn, the whole night, to pre&s;erve it from the depre|dations of deer. He needed not, on this head, to have carried &s;o far from home: the bor|derers of New-fore&s;t are equally &s;ubject to the depredations of the&s;e animals; and are often obliged, when the neighbouring deer have gotten a haunt of their corn-lands, to burn fires all night to deter them. I heard a farmer &s;ay, that it co&s;t him five pounds, one &s;ummer, to guard eight acres of wheat. It is a remark among fore&s;ters, that all the deer-kind are particularly offended by di&s;agreeable &s;mells. The farmer commonly therefore &s;mears the ropes with tar, which he &s;ets up as fences; and throws fetid &s;ub&s;tances into his nightly fires, to di&s;&s;eminate the odour in the &s;moak.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="295">We need not wonder if &s;uch depredations provoke acts of violence. Tho protected by law, the&s;e atrocious marauders very often, and de&s;ervedly, &s;uffer death for their offences.</P>
<P>A farmer however, not long ago, paid dear for taking the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, into his own hands, on an occa&s;ion of this kind. He had frequently lamented the depredations on his corn; and being at all events determined to retaliate, he narrowly ob&s;erved his fields; and having found the track, along which the nightly plunderer advanced, he took his &s;tation near it, as evening drew on, with a rifled barrel well loaden.&mdash;After much li&s;tening, and many little alarms, he at la&s;t heard the bu&s;hes crackling, and giving way in earne&s;t. He now made him&s;elf &s;ure of his prey; and lying clo&s;e, he levelled his piece, &s;o as ju&s;t to take the &s;tag, as he emerged from the thicket. The night was dark; but however allowed him &s;ufficient light to take aim at &s;o large a body. He fired with effect; and had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee his enemy fall. But, on run|ning to him, he was &s;truck with finding he had killed one of the be&s;t hor&s;es of his own team.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="296">The &s;heep does not frequent the fore&s;t in any abundance. Here and there you find a little flock on a dry gravelly hill: but, in general, the fore&s;t abounds with &s;wamps, and mar&s;hy bottoms, highly pernicious to the &s;heep&mdash;the only animal perhaps, except one, which pur&s;ues with the greate&s;t avidity, what is mo&s;t de&s;tructive to it. It is the le&s;s how|ever to be lamented, that the lawns of the fore&s;t are not decorated with the&s;e animals, as they are certainly le&s;s adapted to a fore&s;t-&s;cene, than deer; tho in them&s;elves perhaps, more picture&s;que. The fore&s;t is wild, and they are dome&s;tic.</P>
<P>With hares and rabbits the fore&s;t abounds. The latter are the under-keeper's perqui&s;ite; and of cour&s;e well looked after. There are many dry, &s;andy knolls, where colonies of the&s;e inmates are &s;ettled; which are not among the lea&s;t amu&s;ing of the minute inhabitants of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="297">In the &s;ame cla&s;s we rank the &s;quirrel. He is not of con&s;equence to be numbered among the picture&s;que ornaments of a &s;cene: but his form, and manners; his activity, and feats of dexterity, are very amu&s;ing. On extraordinary occa&s;ions, when he is agitated by love, or anger, his mu&s;cles acquire tenfold ela&s;ticity. He de&s;cends a tree in a rapid &s;piral, as quick as thought&mdash;darts up another in an oppo&s;ite direction&mdash;flings him&s;elf from tree to tree with amazing exactne&s;s&mdash;and pur&s;ues his mate, or his rival, among the mazy branches of an oak, with a velocity that eludes the &s;ight.</P>
<P>Phea&s;ants al&s;o greatly abound in many parts of the fore&s;t. In the manors of Beaulieu, Fawley, and other places, where they are protected, they multiply beyond belief. They are &s;een often in flocks feeding like poultry, in the fields; and adorning the woods, and cop&s;es, with their elegant &s;hape, and glo&s;&s;y plumage.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="298">The partridge is not &s;o fond of the wild &s;cenes of the fore&s;t, as the phea&s;ant. She is more the bird of cultivation. Where the plough flouri&s;hes, &s;he thrives; and &s;eldom chu&s;es to inhabit a country in a &s;tate of nature. The phea&s;ant has no objection to a field of corn; but he can procure his living without it. He can make a hearty meal of the wild berries of the woods: or content him&s;elf with a belly-full of acorns. To him therefore corn is a luxury; to the partridge it is a nece&s;&s;ary. She is generally found gleaning the &s;tubble, or ba&s;king under a hedge; and gets into many a difficulty, which &s;he might have avoided by feeding more at large. Sometimes indeed &s;he is found in the fore&s;t; but it is chiefly when &s;he is hunted by men and dogs from her fa|vourite haunts</P>
<P>The black-cock, on the other hand, is more a fore&s;ter, than even the phea&s;ant. He has no connection with man. He &s;corns the inclo&s;ure; and all the dainties of the &s;tubble. The wild fore&s;t is his only delight;
<PB N="286" REF="299">
and there, his plea&s;ures lie more in it's open, than in it's woody &s;cenes. This bird was formerly found in great abundance in New-fore&s;t; but he is now much &s;carcer; tho he has the honour, which no other bird can boa&s;t, of being protected as royal game. To this day when the chief-ju&s;tice-in-eyre, grants his warrants to kill game in the fore&s;t, he always excepts the black-cock, together with red, and fallow-deer.</P>
<P>The plaintive ring-dove al&s;o is a great ad|mirer of the woody &s;cenes of the fore&s;t. Many &s;uppo&s;e her a &s;olitary bird; at lea&s;t, that &s;he flies only with her mate; confound|ing her habits perhaps with tho&s;e of the turtle-dove; which, I believe, is &s;olitary: but the ring-dove is certainly gregarious: I have often &s;een in the fore&s;t large flocks of this &s;pecies together, in the winter months; &s;o well the poet knew their nature, by con|tra&s;ting them with the wood-cock:
<Q><L>While doves in flocks the leafle&s;s trees o'er-&s;hade;</L>
<L>The lonely wood-cock haunts the watry glade.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="300">The wood-cock indeed is &s;ometimes &s;een in the fore&s;t: but the rough lawns and heaths, he finds there, do not intirely &s;uit his appetite. He is curious in the choice of his haunts. He mu&s;t have &s;ome &s;weet woody glen, watered by little ouzing mo&s;&s;y rills, into which he may ea&s;ily thru&s;t his beak; and the&s;e he cannot every where meet with in the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;nipe, le&s;s delicate in her haunts, is the frequent inhabitant of the wilde&s;t &s;cenes. Any &s;wamp, or mar&s;hy &s;pot will plea&s;e her; and of the&s;e &s;he finds abundance in various parts of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>Plover, of different kinds, are common al&s;o in it's heathy parts. I have &s;ome|times &s;een large flocks of the grey &s;pecies; and have &s;tood admiring them, as they in|circled the air. In their regular mode of flight, they in &s;ome degree re&s;emble water-fowl: but they are not &s;o determined in their

cour&s;e; wheeling about, and forming various evolutions, which are very amu&s;ing. Some|times they appear all &s;cattered, and &s;eem in confu&s;ion; till clo&s;ing together, as if by the word of command, they get again into form.</P>
<P>With regard to all the &s;ong&s;ters of the grove, the woody &s;cenes of the fore&s;t are vocal with them. The thru&s;h, the black-bird, the linnet, and the nightingale, abound on every &s;pray. The nightingale above all, delights in the wild &s;cenes of the fore&s;t. The black-bird, and the thru&s;h are often &s;een tripping over the <HI>embelli&s;hed lawn,</HI> or flirting from the <HI>neat trimmed holly-hedge.</HI> But the nightingale rarely frequents the&s;e cultured &s;pots. To her they afford little plea&s;ure. Her commone&s;t haunts are tho&s;e of nature&mdash;the brake, the cop&s;e, the rough hedge, or the fore&s;t, where &s;he &s;ings her melodious &s;trains to woods, and &s;olitude; and often <Q>&mdash;wa&s;tes her &s;weetne&s;s on the de&s;ert air:</Q> only that her voice, &s;o varied, clear, and full, is heard far and wide, when the evening is

<P>Among the <HI>birds of harmony,</HI> there are two, which I &s;hall find it difficult perhaps to e&s;|tabli&s;h in that cla&s;s&mdash;the jay, and the wood|pecker. Their &s;creams, however di&s;cordant in them&s;elves, or when out of place, accord admirably with the fore&s;t; and produce that kind of local harmony, which one of our old poets <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Davenant.</NOTE> a&s;cribes to the &s;ound of a drum: it may be di&s;&s;onant in one place, tho mu&s;ical in another.</P>
<Q><L>What &s;ound is that, who&s;e <HI>concord</HI> makes a <HI>jar?</HI></L>

<P><PB N="290" REF="303">But be&s;ides the harmony ari&s;ing from the agreement of the&s;e wild notes with the &s;cenes of the fore&s;t; there is another &s;ource of it in the &s;ympathetic feelings of the mind.

<P>But however di&s;cordant the <HI>notes</HI> of the&s;e birds may be to the fa&s;tidious ear; their rich, yet harmonious <HI>plumage,</HI> mu&s;t at lea&s;t recom|mend them as highly <HI>ornamental</HI> to every &s;cene,

which they frequent. The wood-pecker par|ticularly is arrayed in the riche&s;t plumage of any bird we have, except the king-fi&s;her: yet all his &s;plendid tints are perfectly har|monious. The jay al&s;o is beautifully tinted on his back, and brea&s;t, with a light purpli&s;h hue, intermixed with grey; and his wing is perhaps the mo&s;t admirable piece of work|man&s;hip in the whole feathered creation.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame ground with the jay, and the wood-pecker, I &s;hould not &s;cruple al&s;o to rank the kite&mdash;if his manners did not di&s;turb the harmony of the woods, as much as his voice &s;upports it. Independent of his man|ners, he is one of the mo&s;t harmonious ap|pendages of the fore&s;t; where Mr. Pennant makes him indigenous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brit. Zool.</NOTE>. He is too &s;mall for picture&s;que u&s;e; but highly ornamental to the natural &s;cene. His motions are ea&s;y, and beautiful in a great degree. He does not flap his pinions, like the rook, or the mag|pie; and labour through the air: he &s;ails
<PB N="292" REF="305">
along, with &s;teady wing, as if he were lord of the element, on which he rode.&mdash;But what harmonize chiefly with the fore&s;t are his wild &s;creams, which &s;trike notes in pe|culiar uni&s;on with tho&s;e &s;cenes, over which he &s;ails.</P>

<P>It is remarkable, that we &s;eldom &s;ee more than two of this &s;pecies together, the male and the female. They &s;eem to divide the fore&s;t into provinces. Each bird hath his own; and, with more than princely caution, avoids his neighbour's. It is his great em|ployment to circle through the air, as the poet de&s;cribes him above, in various evo|lutions over his own woody dominions; where with keen eye, and keener talons, he &s;till pre&s;erves the &s;pirit of the old fore&s;t-law.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="306">Very often the eagle him&s;elf is found in the fore&s;t. Mountainous, and rocky coun|tries are his delight. On the ledge of &s;ome &s;teep, prominent rock he builds his eyry, and rears his royal progeny. But when food be|comes &s;carce in tho&s;e de&s;olate regions, as it &s;ometimes does, he finds it convenient to make an excur&s;ion into the fore&s;t. Here he hunts the leveret, and the fawn; and &s;creens his atrocious deeds in the clo&s;e&s;t woods. Wher|ever he is &s;een, the watchful fore&s;ter endeavours to keep him in &s;ight, till he bring him to the ground. And yet I have heard of a pair of eagles, which took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a part of the fore&s;t, called King's-wood, where they eluded all the arts of the keeper, and continued their annual depredations, for &s;everal years. Some time ago, an eagle was killed, after three di&s;charges, near A&s;hy-lodge; and was ex|tended, like the imperial arms, in the court|room of the king's-hou&s;e at Lyndhur&s;t.</P>
<P>Of all the feathered inhabitants of the fore&s;t I &s;hould have thought it's &s;cenes, in all re&s;pects, the be&s;t adapted to the rook. Here he might build his habitation; and rear his

young, far from the prying eyes of men. Here al&s;o he might indulge his &s;ocial temper without limits; and inlarge his aerial town from wood to wood.&mdash;But he has no &s;uch ideas. I cannot learn that he ever thought of forming a &s;ettlement in the fore&s;t; which is the more extraordinary, as he is in fact a lover of it's &s;cenes; and rejoices in them at all times, but in the breeding-&s;ea&s;on, when one &s;hould ima|gine, he &s;tood mo&s;t in need of their &s;helter. At that time he &s;eems &s;edulou&s;ly to court the faithle&s;s habitations of men; through what propen&s;ity, or in&s;tinct of nature, the naturali&s;t is wholly at a lo&s;s to determine. After his family is reared, and he has carried off in &s;afety &s;uch of his progeny, as have e&s;caped the arts of men, and boys, he retires every evening, at a late hour, during the autumn, and winter months, to the clo&s;e&s;t covers of the fore&s;t, having &s;pent the day in the open fields, and inclo&s;ures, in que&s;t of food. His late retreat to the fore&s;t, is characteri&s;tic of the near approach of night.

<P>But in his economy there is &s;omething &s;in|gular. Tho the fore&s;t is his winter-habitation (if I may call that his habitation, which, like other vagrants, he u&s;es only as a place to &s;leep in) he generally every day vi&s;its his nur&s;ery; keeping up the idea of a family, which he begins to make provi&s;ion for in earne&s;t very early in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>Among all the &s;ounds of animal nature, &s;ew are more plea&s;ing than the cawing of rooks. The rook has but two, or three notes; and when he attempts a &s;olo, we cannot prai&s;e his &s;ong. But when he performs in concert, which is his chief delight, the&s;e two or three notes, tho rough in them&s;elves, being mixed, and intermixed with the notes of a multitude, have all their &s;harp edges worn off, and become very harmonious; e&s;pecially when &s;oftened in the air, where the band chiefly exhibits. You have this mu&s;ic in perfection, when the whole colony is rou&s;ed by the di&s;charge of a gun.&mdash;The cawing of rooks however is a &s;ound not &s;o congenial to the fore&s;t, as it is to the grove.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="309">Among the winged inhabitants of the fore&s;t we &s;hould not forget the honey-bee, which every where covers the &s;urface of it. The&s;e wide demei&s;ns are in many parts &s;pread with heath, which is one of the favorite vege|tables of this indu&s;trious in&s;ect. Where this abounds, the cottager commonly carries out his hives in winter, hiding them, as he can, from ob&s;ervation; and fencing them from the annoyance of cattle. There he leaves them, till &s;warming-time, when they nece&s;&s;arily become the objects of his care; and if he is fortunate, his profits are con&s;iderable. I knew a cottager who made above fifteen guineas, in one year, of his fore&s;t-honey; tho he &s;old it only at three pence a pound. Sometimes the hive is di&s;covered, and &s;tolen; tho in general it is a garri&s;on, which can defend it&s;elf pretty well: however as the prudent pea&s;ant never places all his wealth in one place, he generally at wor&s;t, &s;ecures enough to repay his trouble. &mdash;Hamp&s;hire-honey is in good e&s;teem; but it is rather the honey produced in the northern parts of the county, than what is commonly called <HI>fore&s;t-honey.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Conclu&s;ion of the whole.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THUS I have carried my reader through all the varieties I know, of wood|land &s;cenes. I con&s;idered fir&s;t the &s;ingle tree as the origin, and foundation of all. I con|&s;idered next the various combinations of trees, under the &s;everal beautiful forms of &s;cenery, which they compo&s;e: and as the fore&s;t is of all others, the grande&s;t, and mo&s;t intere&s;ting combination of trees, I dwelt the longe&s;t on this part of my &s;ubject; &s;electing New-fore&s;t in Hamp&s;hire as an example to illu&s;trate the &s;everal ob&s;ervations I had made. Through this picture&s;que country I have led my reader geographically; and have pre&s;ented him with a great variety of beautiful &s;cenes&mdash;woods&mdash;lawns &mdash;heaths&mdash;fore&s;t-di&s;tances&mdash;and &s;ea-coa&s;t
<PB N="304" REF="317">
views. I have adorned the&s;e &s;cenes al&s;o with their proper appendages, wild hor&s;es, deer, and other picture&s;que inhabitants.&mdash;I might greatly have multiplied both my <HI>general</HI> and <HI>particular</HI> remaks; but I fear I ought rather to apologize for my <HI>redundances,</HI> than my <HI>omi&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>I now clo&s;e my ob&s;ervations with a &s;igh over the tran&s;itory &s;tate of the &s;everal &s;cenes, I have de&s;cribed. I mean not, with unphi|lo&s;ophic weakne&s;s, to bemoan the peri&s;hable condition of &s;ublunary things; but to lament only, that, of all &s;ublunary things, the wood-land-&s;cene, which is among the <HI>mo&s;t beautiful,</HI> &s;hould be among the <HI>mo&s;t peri&s;hable.</HI></P>
<P>Some &s;pecies of land&s;cape are of permanent nature; &s;uch particularly as depend on rocks, mountains, lakes, and rivers. The ornamen|tal appendages indeed of the&s;e &s;cenes, the oaks, and elms, that adorn them, are of a more tran&s;ient kind. But the grand con|&s;tituent parts of them may be &s;uppo&s;ed coeval with nature it&s;elf. Nothing le&s;s than &s;ome general convul&s;ion can injure them.</P>
<P>Such land&s;cape again as depends for beauty on old ca&s;tles, abbeys, and other ruins, ge|nerally e&s;capes for ages the depredations of
<PB N="305" REF="318">
time. If the woody appendages of the&s;e &s;cenes, like tho&s;e of lakes, and mountains, are open to injury, yet a quick vegetation re&s;tores them &s;peedily to nature&mdash;unle&s;s indeed the <HI>per&s;ever|ing hand of improvement</HI> intervene.</P>
<P>But the land&s;cape, which depends chiefly on <HI>wood-land &s;cenery,</HI> is always open to in|jury. Every gracele&s;s, hand can fell a tree. The value of timber is it's misfortune. It is rarely &s;uffered to &s;tand, when it is fit for u&s;e; and in a cultivated country, woods are con|&s;idered only as large corn-fields; cut, as &s;oon as ripe: and when they are cut for the u&s;es, to which they are properly de&s;igned, tho we may lament, we &s;hould not repine. But when they are cut, as they often are, yet imma|ture, to make up a matrimonial pur&s;e, or to carry the profits of them to race-grounds, and gaming-hou&s;es, we cannot help wi&s;hing the profligate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors had been placed, like lunatics, and idiots, under the care of guardians, who might have prevented &s;uch ruinous, and unwarrantable wa&s;te.</P>
<P>The depredations, which we have &s;een made in every part of New-fore&s;t; and the va&s;t quantities of timber, which are felled, every year, for the navy; and regularly a&s;&s;igned for
<PB N="306" REF="319">
various other purpo&s;es, cannot but make a con&s;iderable change in it's &s;cenery. The de|&s;cription therefore, which I have given of it, is not the de&s;cription of what it was in the la&s;t century, nor of what it will be in the next. Many alterations in <HI>particular</HI> &s;cenes have taken place, even &s;ince this work was begun. In a fore-ground, the cutting down of two or three &s;tately trees makes an e&s;&s;ential al|teration; and much change of this kind hath been made in many places. In the&s;e in&s;tances therefore the remarks here offered mu&s;t be con&s;idered as <HI>hi&s;tory,</HI> rather than as <HI>de&s;cription.</HI> They attempt to chronicle &s;cenes, which once exi&s;ted, and are now gone. That grand vi&s;ta, which hath been de&s;cribed between Brokenhur&s;t, and Lyndhur&s;t, hath, &s;ince the&s;e remarks were made, undergone much change. Many of the nobler trees, which adorned it, have been felled: and many of the old decaying trees, and others which had been &s;tunted under the &s;hade of tho&s;e, that had been felled, are now grown &s;till more decayed, and ragged. They are ill-clad and thin; and their withered branches every where &s;tare out, unadorned, and naked through their meagre foliage. From the&s;e cau&s;es, and the deformed gaps, which the felling of good trees hath oc|ca&s;ioned,
<PB N="307" REF="320">
this avenue hath lo&s;t much of it's beauty.&mdash;The reader will &s;till remember, that when in the early part of the work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. I. p. 8.</NOTE>, I con&s;idered the maladies of trees as a &s;ource of picture&s;que beauty, I meant it only with regard to individuals placed in particular circum&s;tances. Here, where we are contemplating the beauties of what &s;hould be a rich fore&s;t-&s;cene, they are out of place.&mdash;It mu&s;t however be added, that altho the&s;e changes are continually hap|pening among the ancient oaks of the fore&s;t; yet as young trees are growing old, nature is al&s;o continually working up new <HI>fore-grounds</HI> to her land&s;capes; tho it is a much ea&s;ier bu&s;ine&s;s to <HI>deform,</HI> than to <HI>re&s;tore.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>di&s;tant</HI> &s;cenery of the fore&s;t indeed, where effect depends on va&s;t <HI>combinations of trees,</HI> and may be produced even from the inferior kinds, the inroads of the axe are le&s;s ob&s;erved. Tho the choice&s;t oaks therefore may be removed; yet if a &s;ufficiency of meaner trees is left, no con&s;iderable change will happen, for many years, in the di&s;tant land&s;capes of the fore&s;t. The lawns, and heaths, in which it's
<PB N="308" REF="321">
greate&s;t beauty con&s;i&s;ts, will pre&s;erve their or|naments: and, unle&s;s where their dimen&s;ions are &s;mall (in which ca&s;e &s;tately trees are re|quired as fore-grounds,) they may long remain the objects of admiration.</P>
