<HEAD>BOOK III. ON THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE OF THE SOUL AND BODY.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have examined the different functions and me|chani&s;m of the body; we have con&s;ider|ed the &s;oul in its faculties; we have fol|lowed the&s;e faculties in their unfolding and exerci&s;e: in a word, we have endea|voured to di&s;cover the nature of the &s;oul and body by their effects.</P>
<P>Although this does not convey the full &s;cience of Man, it is yet its proper ground work; and without it, we &s;hould in vain attempt to explain the arcana of human nature; &s;o that the greate&s;t philo&s;ophers, without this guide, may be &s;aid to wander amid&s;t thick darkne&s;s. A philo&s;ophic en|quirer will indeed at times perceive &s;ome feeble glimmerings of light, but will ne|ver acquire a perfect knowledge of the &s;ubject; he will only collect &s;ome &s;catter|ed ideas, and unconnected truths, without
<PB N="4" REF="7">any relation the one to the other. Having therefore con&s;idered Man in the differ|ent &s;ub&s;tances of which he is compo&s;ed; let us now con&s;ider Man properly &s;o called, try to di&s;cover the reciprocal influence of the&s;e two &s;ub&s;tances, and endeavour to in|ve&s;tigate the cau&s;es of their wonderful re|lations. But before we attempt to rea&s;on on the cau&s;es, we mu&s;t fir&s;t a&s;certain the effects. We &s;hall therefore confine our|&s;elves to a preci&s;e and &s;imple expo&s;ition, and reduce our ob&s;ervations to tho&s;e facts which are clear and well &s;upported.</P>
<P>All the parts of nature are connected; air, water, earth, plants, minerals, ani|mated and inanimate &s;ub&s;tances, are all linked together by &s;ome corre&s;pondence between cau&s;es and effects: every being in the univer&s;e is related to &s;ome other, and even the great Author of nature him|&s;elf. But in no po&s;&s;ible union of beings have any two been joined of more oppo&s;ite na|tures, or who&s;e connexion is more intimate, than the &s;oul and body; neither have any two beings a greater or more extraordinary reciprocal influence.</P>
<P>All beings act one upon the other, not by a blind and fortuitous energy, but by
<PB N="5" REF="8">con&s;tant and immutable laws; of this na|ture is the action of the &s;oul on the bo|dy, and of the body on the &s;oul, in all animals.</P>
<P>How plainly &s;oever this influence may appear, it has not been examined with &s;ufficient care and attention: although on &s;uch an enquiry depends the knowledge of the principles and laws of this my&s;teri|ous influence. I &s;hall therefore apply my&s;elf to a cateful examination of the&s;e relations; and as neither the &s;oul nor the body is a &s;imple being, as each of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances is in it&s;elf compound<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay compound, and de&s;ire the reader not to be alarmed. The &s;oul is undoubtedly a compound being, although metaphy&s;icians maintain it to be a &s;imple one, but not compound in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e with the body; its component parts are the different faculties: moreover ob&s;erve, that the term compound does not imply ma|teriality, nor any way contradict the &s;pirituality of the &s;oul.</NOTE> and as their con&s;tituent parts do not all act to|gether, that I may not proceed without a plan, I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h their particular influence, and treat them as di&s;tinct ob|jects. In the prodigious multitude of ob|&s;ervations which may be made on this
<PB N="6" REF="9">&s;ubject, I &s;hall range, in the &s;ame cla&s;s, all tho&s;e which have one common object, connect particular ob&s;ervations with tho&s;e which are general, and, collecting them into one whole, endeavour to give a con|ci&s;e yet complete hi&s;tory of the reciprocal influence of the&s;e two very different &s;ub|&s;tances.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> Of the Power of the <HI>BODY</HI> on the <HI>SOUL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Man has two modes of exi&s;tence, viz. &s;leeping and waking.</P>
<P>Sleep is properly only a mode of the exi&s;tence of the body, in which every function of its organs is &s;u&s;pended, except that of the organs of life: in waking, every &s;pring of the machine is, or may be in action. In both the&s;e &s;tates the &s;oul perceives, thinks, recollects, and all its faculties are in exerci&s;e; but their exerci&s;e is performed differently in each of the&s;e &s;tates. Let us therefore examine the re|lations of the &s;oul to the body, and of the body to the &s;oul, both when &s;leeping and waking.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="7" REF="10">
<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> SLEEPING.</HEAD>
<P>Ob&s;ervation I. As &s;leep approaches, the vivacity of our motions decays, the weary limbs relax and yield to their own weight, the head gradually declines on the &s;houl|der, a &s;entiment of plea&s;ure &s;teals on eve|ty organ, and we &s;eem to feel the gentle motion of the blood as it flows through the veins. The &s;en&s;es are now inactive, but no part is yet a&s;leep; &s;en&s;ibility gra|dually leaves the organs, at length the eyes yield to the plea&s;ing influence of the God, and a refre&s;hing calm reigns through|out the body. The &s;oul likewi&s;e partakes in this enchanting &s;tillne&s;s, forgets every thing, even it&s;elf, and imperceptibly &s;inks into in&s;en&s;ibility. But in this univer&s;al repo&s;e, the mind is not inactive, its ope|rations are only le&s;s &s;en&s;ible; the &s;en&s;a|tions are weak, &s;o likewi&s;e are the &s;enti|ments and ideas, and the more &s;o in pro|portion as the &s;leep is deep.</P>
<P>Freed from the power of the &s;en&s;es, the &s;oul now enjoys its liberty; it thinks, but its thoughts are irregular, incoherent, un|connected; and from their a&s;&s;emblage are formed tho&s;e phanta&s;tic images, tho&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="11">whim&s;ical repre&s;entations, tho&s;e phan|toms, and flitting &s;hades, which con&s;titute our nocturnal illu&s;ions.</P>
<P N="2">II. In &s;leep, thought freely rambles over all kinds of objects, and imagination appears to be the only acting power. Al|though the &s;oul at that time appears to be entirely freed from all &s;ubjection to the body, the di&s;po&s;ition of the corporeal organs always determine the nature of the dream. If the &s;en&s;ation then felt by the body be agreeable, there is a continual &s;eries of plea&s;ing illu&s;ions and flattering images. On the contrary, if the &s;en&s;a|tion be painful, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of frightful ideas and hideous objects, haunt us during &s;leep; mon&s;trous phantoms, &s;cenes of blood and death appear; gho&s;ts, goblins, and horrible &s;pectres terrify us.</P>
<P>The influence of the body is not con|fined to the nature of the objects of our dreams; it likewi&s;e regulates their conti|nuance. If the body is afflicted with any langui&s;hing di&s;order, the&s;e &s;pectres and the&s;e phantoms &s;eldom di&s;appear, and &s;eem to haunt us continually. On the contra|ry, if the body is affected by any acute di&s;order, the illu&s;ions are tran&s;ient, the
<PB N="9" REF="12">phantoms a&s;&s;ume many different forms, and &s;ucceed each other very rapidly.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething yet more wonder|ful in the analogy between the dream and the then pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>If we at any time experience, during &s;leep, tho&s;e plea&s;ing titillations, which the &s;emen, when redundant, produces on the organs of plea&s;ure, we fancy we &s;ee agreea|ble objects; that we hold conver&s;e with beautiful fair ones, in inchanted groves; they that expo&s;e all their virgin charms to our fight, and withhold nothing from our de&s;ires. In painful &s;en&s;ations, appear phenomena equally &s;urpri&s;ing, whereof every one doubtle&s;s has had expe|rience, again&s;t his will.</P>
<P>When we lie in an unea&s;y po&s;ture, where|by re&s;piration is oppre&s;&s;ed, and the circu|lation of the fluids ob&s;tructed, we dream of being pur&s;ued by enemies, &s;pectres, &s;or|cerers, devils, whil&s;t we have not the power to fly.</P>
<P>In the heat of a fever, we dream that we are peri&s;hing with thir&s;t, that we tra|ver&s;e immen&s;e regions in &s;earch of foun|tains, without finding any, and that when we have found one, we apply our
<PB N="10" REF="13">parched lips to it, but the water flies back, and all our efforts to allay our thir&s;t are in vain; &s;o that like <HI>Tantalus,</HI> we peri&s;h through want amid&s;t the greate&s;t abun|dance.</P>
<P N="3">III. In dreams, we think much, feel more, and reflect little; the &s;en&s;ations and images &s;ucceed each other with rapi|dity, but the &s;oul neither compares nor remembers them.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Although in general the &s;oul re|flects but very little during &s;leep, the de|gree of reflection is not the &s;ame in every individual. The ideas, which &s;trongly affect us whil&s;t awake, are retraced in the mind during &s;leep, and we continue to combine them. Thus geometricians form and combine figures, poets make ver&s;es, and philo&s;ophers rea&s;on.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> WAKING.</HEAD>
<P N="5">V. When the body has been refre&s;hed by re&s;t, the organs of &s;en&s;e in&s;en&s;ibly re|&s;ume their functions, the pul&s;e gradually quickens, the face regains its colour, and by degrees all tho&s;e vain images, enchant|ed regions, and ideal objects di&s;appear;
<PB N="11" REF="14">in fine, Man opens his eyes, and is con|&s;cious where he is.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that the exerci&s;e of the fa|culties of the &s;oul is not performed dur|ing &s;leep, as when we are awake; and even when we are awake, it is not al|ways performed invariably in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The &s;oul grows weary ju&s;t as the body does. When fatigued with too in|ten&s;e or too long application, it lo&s;es in &s;ome degree the faculty of applying it&s;elf to one &s;ubject; the ideas become weak and languid, there are no more &s;allies of wit, no more flights of genius. In this &s;tate, &s;hould we force attention, immedi|ately every thing in the mind is effaced, we no longer think, we fall into a kind of le|thargy, and a kind of in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>When the body is fatigued, its motions no longer retain their vigor, all its func|tions are weakly performed, external ob|jects produce only weak impre&s;&s;ions on its organs, and the &s;en&s;ations have neither force nor vivacity.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The mind not only becomes fatigued like the body, but what is mo&s;t &s;ingular, they become both fatigued at the &s;ame time.
<PB N="12" REF="15">The fatigue of the body is always accom|panied by the fatigue of the &s;oul, and the fatigue of the &s;oul, by that of the body: the one is never unattended by the other; and what is no le&s;s &s;trange, the wearine&s;s of the&s;e two &s;ub&s;tances is equal in its ex|treme degree only.</P>
<P>Is the body fatigued to exce&s;s, the mind cannot give attention to any object, its perceptions are weak, and as if pa&s;&s;ive to the objects which are pre&s;ented, it no longer thinks nor reflects; it recollects no|thing, and frequently remembers not the impre&s;&s;ion received but the moment be|fore; the de&s;ires of the &s;oul are weak, it wills nothing &s;trongly, and &s;eems not to retain the power of determining it&s;elf; in &s;hort, the &s;oul is in a kind of drow|&s;ine&s;s, and, as it were, in a reverie which wears outwardly the appear|ance of meditation. Is the mind fatigued to exce&s;s, external objects produce only weak impre&s;&s;ions on the &s;en&s;es, and the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions produce only weak &s;en&s;ations on the &s;oul; motion is painful, and all the organs are in a &s;tupor.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. In di&s;ea&s;es of the body, we fre|quently ob&s;erve rea&s;on lo&s;t, and a delirium
<PB N="13" REF="16">overtakes the &s;oul; this is evident in the hy&s;teric affection, that terrible di&s;|order which afflicts the fair &s;ex, and is &s;o &s;ingular in its &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>Often when the &s;oul is engro&s;&s;ed by plea&s;ure, their gaiety gradually di&s;appears, and a profound &s;adne&s;s &s;ucceeds; the &s;ight grows dim, involuntary tears flow, the mouth is half open, every part of the face is convul&s;ed, the limbs lo&s;e their flexibili|ty, are violently di&s;tended, and the body is &s;trongly contorted: when the&s;e violent agitations, which are of no long conti|nuance, cea&s;e, an extreme &s;tupor en|&s;ues, and the countenance wears the livid hue of death: when the complexion has recovered its colour, in&s;en&s;ibly the other extreme &s;ucceeds, and the countenance appears inflamed; the pul&s;ation of the temporal arteries is very great, re&s;pi|ration is no longer oppre&s;&s;ed, the unhappy patient fetches deep &s;ighs, opens her eyes, and &s;tares wildly round her. She at la&s;t recovers her voice; and the di&s;agreeable &s;cene &s;ometimes concludes in immoderate fits of laughter, often in &s;hedding tears and in &s;hrieks, and always with incoherent talk.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="14" REF="17">IX. Another proof of the di&s;order of the mind in di&s;ea&s;es of the body, is &s;een in a ca&s;e which at pre&s;ent offers it&s;elf to my ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The gay, the agreeable D&mdash;, ble&s;&s;ed with the gifts of fortune, the beloved hu&s;band of a mo&s;t amiable woman, was &s;uddenly affected with extreme &s;adne&s;s, the con&s;equence of immoderate venery. Di&s;gu&s;ted at every thing as if by enchant|ment, his &s;oul receives no plea&s;ure from the mo&s;t agreeable objects; nothing can engage his attention; what he formerly eagerly &s;ought after, he now as eagerly avoids; he &s;huns company, and betakes him|&s;elf to &s;olitude, &s;hutting him&s;elf up alone in his chamber; &s;ometimes from a pen&s;ive &s;ilence he &s;tarts with terror; at others, he mutters &s;ome extravagant di&s;cour&s;e to him|&s;elf; la&s;tly, when &s;leep has clo&s;ed his eyes wearied with watching, he enjoys no re&s;t; then hideous &s;pectres appear, he cries out for help, and awakes in extreme terror.</P>
<P>For ever either quite &s;ilent or raving, his complexion at times is of a very lively colour, his eyes protuberant, as if ready to &s;tart from their &s;ockets, his looks wild, his limbs violently agitated, he vents his
<PB N="15" REF="18">rage on him&s;elf, and is ready to tear him|&s;elf in pieces; his eyes afterwards appear &s;ad, his head reclines on his brea&s;t, his arms hang down, his whole body is af|fected with a &s;tupor, again he falls into a &s;ullen &s;ilence and melancholy, bur&s;ts into involuntary tears, and fetches deep &s;ighs.</P>
<P>But how many in&s;tances have we of this &s;ad truth in tho&s;e evils to which na|ture has &s;ubjected us? How &s;light a cau&s;e is &s;ufficient to deprive man of rea&s;on!</P>
<P N="10">X. A &s;imple wound &s;hall &s;ometimes render the &s;oul delirious.</P>
<P>The unhappy per&s;on, who has been run through the body with a &s;word, feels an acute pain in the wounded part, the pain increa&s;es, and is in&s;en&s;ibly ex|tended to every part. The body is at fir&s;t &s;lightly convul&s;ed, by degrees re&s;|piration is oppre&s;&s;ed, the countenance is inflamed, the eyes are &s;woln, he &s;tares wildly round him, and his limbs are vio|lently convul&s;ed. This di&s;order of the corporeal organs is in&s;tantly communica|ted to the &s;oul, every idea is di&s;turbed; in this unver&s;al confu&s;ion, the unfortu|nate &s;ufferer knows neither the voice of his friends, nor the features of his parents,
<PB N="16" REF="19">who &s;tand round his bed, attempting to awaken &s;entiment, and recall life.</P>
<P>In the&s;e di&s;orders, a foreign power pre&s;|&s;es on the &s;oul and &s;ubdues it, the limbs are in an involuntary agitation, nor can the &s;oul keep down its unruly emotions, or re&s;train its tran&s;ports.</P>
<P N="11">XI. To behold the manner in which the &s;oul partakes of the affections of the body, we &s;hould almo&s;t be induced to be|lieve it material.</P>
<P>In our recovery after a long and high fever, which has con&s;umed the principle of &s;trength, the &s;oul is as weak as the body; the &s;en&s;ations have no vivacity, &s;entiment is dull, de&s;ire languid, and we receive no plea&s;ure from the mo&s;t a|greeable objects; recollection is likewi&s;e decayed, and we &s;carcely remember an action done the moment before: the under|&s;tanding is principally affected with this languor: with difficulty we compare the mo&s;t &s;imple objects, we cannot reflect, all the faculties of the &s;oul are in a &s;tupor. The more this di&s;order of the body pre|vails, the weaker is the &s;oul; as the or|gans regain their force, conception gra|dually
<PB N="17" REF="20">returns, and is not in its vigour till the body is perfectly recovered.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Acute di&s;ea&s;es are always attended with weak conception, weak remem|brance, and weak recollection; chronical di&s;ea&s;es are accompanied with the &s;ame &s;ymptoms; but this decay of recollection, conception, and remembrance, is more &s;en&s;ible in that affection of the <HI>ductus me|dullae &s;pinalis,</HI> called the <HI>&s;pina bifida,</HI> when the tumor is opened, and yet more in le|thargies.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable lo&s;s of the &s;permatic fluid produces the &s;ame phenomena. Hard drinkers commonly become &s;tupid in length of time, and lo&s;e all &s;entiment, remembrance, and recollection.</P>
<P>The unhappy per&s;ons who have been obliged to undergo the operation of the trepan, apoplectics, and tho&s;e who have been re&s;tored to life after hanging, remain for a long time &s;tupid, without remem|brance, without conception, and &s;ome|times continue for ever after of a dull un|der&s;tanding, and unfaithful memory; not even remembring the pain they felt when they &s;uffered.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="18" REF="21">XIII. The &s;ame effects, which are pro|duced by di&s;ea&s;es on the &s;oul, are &s;ome|times produced by violent pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ometimes by extreme application. How many are rendered in&s;en&s;ible by fear! How many by too great attention to &s;ome par|ticular object!</P>
<P><HI>Ta&s;&s;o,</HI> the celebrated Italian poet, be|came in&s;ane by extreme application to &s;tudy; in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;urviving him&s;elf, forgetting both his name and his works.</P>

<P N="14">XIV. Finally, by a kind of prodigy, we ob&s;erve &s;ome per&s;ons to lo&s;e one part of the powers of the &s;oul, and retain the other: &s;ome lo&s;e the faculties of medita|tion, and reflection, without lo&s;ing the judgment; others lo&s;e the recollection, yet retain the remembrance, as if the&s;e different powers of the mind depended on particular organs of the body.</P>
<P N="15">XV. The <HI>Microcephali</HI> have le&s;s me|mory, le&s;s brilliancy of wit, le&s;s penetra|tion
<PB N="19" REF="22">than common per&s;ons: whil&s;t <HI>Ma|crocephali</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e qualities in a very eminent degree; as if the &s;oul were too much confined in the heads of the former, and that the &s;piritual faculties were ever proportionate to the volume of the organs, in which they re&s;ide.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. It is frequently ob&s;erved, on the relations between the body and the &s;oul, that very corpulent per&s;ons have commonly no imagination, no &s;agacity, no delicacy of wit, they have only good &s;en&s;e. When the degree of corpulency is prodigious, dul|ne&s;s nearly approaches &s;tupidity; the &s;oul then appears to be oppre&s;&s;ed by the redun|dancy of matter.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. The following &s;ingular relations between the &s;oul and body, have been con|&s;tantly verified by experience.</P>
<P>A quick and penetrating mind is ever united to a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let it be remembered, that when I term a body <HI>&s;en&s;ible,</HI> I mean a body endued with an high degree of &s;en&s;ibility.</NOTE> &s;en&s;ible and vigorous body; and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="23">A profound and &s;ublime mind is united to a body vigorous and &s;trong<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;peak not here of the extent of our knowledge, or of the number of ideas. I &s;peak of their cha|racters only.</NOTE>. There will certainly appear &s;ome &s;igns of a vi|gorous mind in a man, who&s;e body is &s;en|&s;ible and vigorous; none but tho&s;e per|&s;ons only, who, together with vigour, en|joy &s;trength of con&s;titution, know how to deliver their ideas with energy and con|tinued force. Only &s;uch could compo&s;e the Phar&s;alia of Lucan, the Dramas of Shake&s;pear, and the energetic writings of the author of Emilius.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. If delicate and feeble per&s;ons have no vivacity either of body or mind, and if this vivacity of mind ever accom|pany vigour of body, it is likewi&s;e cer|tain, that a body extremely delicate and &s;en&s;ible, is ever united to an erroneous and incon&s;i&s;tent mind; whil&s;t we &s;ee that, on the contrary, a body, which is robu&s;t and le&s;s &s;en&s;ible, ever contains a mind that is proportionably the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>The body influences the &s;oul &s;everal ways; we not only ob&s;erve &s;triking rela|tions
<PB N="21" REF="24">between it and our &s;olids, we ob|&s;erve very &s;ingular ones between the mind and the circulation of our fluids'.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. Whili&s;t the blood circulates with great velocity, man is agitated with a kind of phrenzy, raves, lo&s;es his remembrance and rea&s;on; his ideas are confounded, and in the univer&s;al di&s;order which prevails in his &s;oul he forgets his friends, wife, chil|dren, and even his name.</P>
<P>In proportion as the circulation is le&s;s quick, &s;o much the weaker are the mo|tions of the &s;oul; a gentle calm &s;ucceeds the&s;e furious tran&s;ports, it recovers recol|lection and rea&s;on, and the thoughts fall again into their natural order.</P>
<P N="20">XX. Whenever the operations of the &s;oul are well performed, and the &s;oul acts with entire liberty, the blood flows with moderate velocity; on the contrary, it circulates with great rapidity in frenzies, in &s;trong agitations of the mind, and when the lamp of wi&s;dom is extinct.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. When the body is violently agi|tated, it drives re&s;t from the &s;oul; per|&s;ons in fevers continue &s;leeple&s;s many days; in vain they &s;eek for repo&s;e, their firm|ne&s;s
<PB N="22" REF="25">is exhau&s;ted, and their &s;ouls &s;oon yield to a mortal languor.</P>
<P>The relations ob&s;erved between the &s;tate of the body, and the character of the mind, are likewi&s;e ob&s;erved between the &s;tate of the body, and the character of the pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. A body &s;en&s;ible and &s;trong is united to a &s;oul, &s;u&s;ceptible of violent and mo&s;t durable pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>A body robu&s;t and but little &s;en&s;ible is united to a &s;oul, &s;u&s;ceptible of moderate, yet durable pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>A body delicate and &s;en&s;ible is joined to a &s;oul &s;ubject to pa&s;&s;ions, &s;trong, but of &s;hort duration.</P>
<P>A per&s;on delicate and of &s;trong &s;en&s;a|tions is ea&s;ily kindled into rage, but this is of very &s;hort continuance. A vigorous and robu&s;t per&s;on is not ea&s;ily inflamed, but his pa&s;&s;ion when excited is of long duration: the rage of the fir&s;t is a fire which blazes, and is &s;oon extingui&s;hed; that of the other is like the waters of the ocean, which at fir&s;t oppo&s;e great re&s;i&s;t|ance to the fury of the winds, but retain their motion a con&s;iderable time when once excited.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="26">Finally, a body feeble, and but of weak &s;en&s;ations, is united to a peaceful &s;oul, en|tirely exempt from ardor, which experi|ences only the weak impul&s;es of an inde|termined will, and knows no more of the pa&s;&s;ions than their name; and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P N="23">XXIII. An impetuous &s;oul is ever united to a &s;en&s;ible and vigorous body: a peace|ful &s;oul to a body robu&s;t, or endued with little &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>But there are ob&s;erved yet other rela|tions between the &s;tate of the body, and the character of the &s;oul.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. In chronic di&s;orders, and dur|ing a &s;tate of convale&s;cence after acute<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I mean tho&s;e acute di&s;ea&s;es, which di&s;order all the functions of the animal oeconomy; not tho&s;e that affect a part only.</NOTE> di&s;ea&s;es, the &s;oul is languid like the body, nor can any thing give it plea&s;ure; ob|jects, which delighted before, no longer excite any emotion, the mind is melan|choly, thoughtful, and &s;ullen; whil&s;t Man, in vigorous health, is gay, lively and fickle. Exce&s;&s;ive lo&s;s of &s;emen in the male likewi&s;e affects the &s;oul with &s;adne&s;s and languor.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27">You can hardly know, under that de|jected, that pen&s;ive and melancholy air, effects of immoderate venery, the man who before was &s;o &s;prightly and &s;o gay.</P>
<P>The fire which &s;parkled in his eyes is extingui&s;hed; the liveline&s;s of his com|plexion is gone, and his countenance de|mon&s;trates the languor of his &s;oul; the days pa&s;s unperceived, nothing engages his attention, his drooping &s;oul finks into that forlorn &s;tate, which is the type of death. Whence does this metamorpho&s;is proceed? From the lo&s;s of a &s;mall quan|tity of the nervous fluid.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. Di&s;ea&s;es not only render man thoughtful and &s;ad, they &s;ometimes &s;teel the heart and beget inhumanity; for you frequently &s;ee per&s;ons, who are by nature amiable and gay, rendered by &s;ome di&s;temper, re&s;tle&s;s, &s;u&s;picious, di&s;|tru&s;tful, ill natured and peevi&s;h; they grieve for the mo&s;t trifling cau&s;e, and are di&s;plea&s;ed with every thing &s;aid or done.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. The gay &s;eek after agreeable, diverting and comic amu&s;ements; the &s;ad, tho&s;e which are mournful, and of a tragic nature; to the&s;e joy is di&s;plea&s;ing; they would have every thing wear a face of
<PB N="25" REF="28">mourning<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ob&s;ervation takes place, when the &s;oul is a prey to grief, and before it receives any motive of con&s;olation; but it is never more con&s;picuous than in men of a melancholy temper.</NOTE> about them, they tell and hear told, with a kind of plea&s;ure, tragic ad|ventures; they &s;hun the company of the gay, and retire to fore&s;ts, woods, caves, rocks, de&s;erts, and to &s;avage nature, like tho&s;e reptiles which feed on herbs which are poi&s;on to others.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. Whil&s;t all the functions of our organs are well performed, whil&s;t the fluids circulate within us ea&s;ily, and with a moderate velocity, the body is in health; in this &s;tate the &s;oul enjoys all the vigour it is capable of. Are the func|tions of the body changed? Is the circu|lation of our fluids languid or difficult? The body is di&s;ea&s;ed, man is then &s;ubject to great weakne&s;s, his powers are inactive, his &s;oul is incapable of any great under|taking, he fears every thing, and attempts nothing.</P>
<P>Man in health is intrepid, without it, he is pu&s;illanimous.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. Immoderate coition is at|tended with the &s;ame effects with di&s;ea&s;e;
<PB N="26" REF="29">we moreover ob&s;erve that males, who have been deprived of the parts charac|teri&s;tic of the &s;ex before they were perfectly developed, ever retain an effeminate di&s;|po&s;ition, are le&s;s vivacious, le&s;s brave, and le&s;s fierce, than tho&s;e who have not been mutilated in this manner.</P>
<P>They, who have one te&s;ticle only, are le&s;s lively, le&s;s intrepid than tho&s;e who have two; they, who have three, are pro|portionably more lively.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. But the manner, in which the affections of the &s;oul follow the &s;tate of the body, is yet more &s;urpri&s;ing. When a &s;oldier, in the heat of an engagement, re|ceives a mortal wound, he becomes the more impetuous; at the &s;ight of his blood, he is in&s;pired with a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and with new force; but he &s;oon perceives his &s;trength to fail, a freezing cold &s;hoots through his veins, all his powers decay, a mortal languor &s;ucceeds; his courage fails, and his rage declines as the blood &s;lows from his wound.</P>
<P>There are other relations between the con&s;titution of the organs and the mental character.</P>
<P N="30"><PB N="27" REF="30">XXX. Boldne&s;s and openne&s;s of tem|per ever accompany &s;trength and vigour of body. To obtain their de&s;ires, the weak u&s;e &s;tratagem; the &s;trong, open force. This may be ob&s;erved even among brute animals; the weak practice cun|ning, whil&s;t the lion goes &s;traight to his prey and attacks it openly.</P>
<P>But between firmne&s;s and con&s;titution, we ob&s;erve relations oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e ob|&s;erved between con&s;titution and boldne&s;s. A delicate, yet vigorous body, never con|tains a &s;oul endued with fortitude. Tho&s;e fine gentlemen, who are &s;o brave at the head of their company, have no firmne&s;s when they &s;uffer any acute pain. Wo|men are more courageous, but le&s;s firm than men. How many heroes have con|fronted all the dangers of undaunted war, and yet have &s;hed tears through extreme pain?</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. A very apparent relation be|tween the con&s;titution and mental character is, that weakne&s;s of mind always accom|panies weakne&s;s of body.</P>
<P>Age, infancy and di&s;ea&s;e, are credu|lous; women, more than men: they be|lieve in witchcraft, reading of dreams,
<PB N="28" REF="31">palme&s;try, old wives tales, &s;pirits, phan|toms; in a word, all the extravagancies of human rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. To an attentive examiner, there appears a con&s;tant relation between the organization of the body and the affec|tions of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>The &s;oul united to gro&s;s organs, delights in very lively amu&s;ements and noi&s;y plea|&s;ures: united to delicate organs, it loves calm refined amu&s;ements. Lively co|lours are mo&s;t agreeable to robu&s;t men; &s;uch delight in warlike mu&s;ick, pungent odours, and &s;trong liquors: delicate per|&s;ons on the contrary love light colours, &s;oft mu&s;ick, the gentle per&s;umes of the ro&s;e and ja&s;min. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be made with regard to the plea&s;ures of the mind; delicate per&s;ons are aver&s;e to the noi&s;y amu&s;ements of the robu&s;t; they are fond of the &s;ofter plea&s;ures, the &s;weet overflowings of the &s;oul, t&ecirc;tes &agrave; t&ecirc;tes, and all the enjoyments which ari&s;e from the tender emotions of the heart.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. If a great lo&s;s of &s;emen in|volve the &s;oul in &s;adne&s;s, and &s;ometimes in a kind of &s;tupid in&s;en&s;ibility, the lo&s;s of a &s;mall quantity of the nervous fluid wea|kens
<PB N="29" REF="32">the motions of the &s;oul, and turns &s;entiment into tenderne&s;s. After the fir&s;t enjoyments the lover is without any live|ly emotion, though in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that felicity, with which he was inebri|ated a few moments before. To his for|mer violent tran&s;ports &s;ucceeds a plea&s;ing &s;tillne&s;s; his love for his mi&s;tre&s;s conti|nues, but his pa&s;&s;ion has lo&s;t its ardour; he &s;till pre&s;&s;es her to his bo&s;om, but no longer devours her charms; his care&s;&s;es are more tender, more affectionate, and his mind being entirely engaged by plea&s;ure, views, with delight, tho&s;e beauties which had &s;o violently enchanted his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. If the body &s;trongly influence the &s;oul, the aliments affect it in a man|ner no le&s;s &s;urprizing.</P>
<P>What a power has wine over this im|material &s;ub&s;tance! By this beneficent li|quor, a calm is re&s;tored to our troubled minds, it drives away pain, fear, &s;u&s;pi|cion, and introduces hope and joy in their &s;tead. By wine, misfortune for|gets its evils, and con&s;uming cares give place to plea&s;ing illu&s;ions and agreable ideas. By wine, joy pre&s;ides at banquets,
<PB N="30" REF="33">gets po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hearts of the gue&s;ts, and breaks out in &s;ongs and merriment.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. The power of wine is not con|fined to the in&s;piring hope and joy; it likewi&s;e in&s;pires love, and renders the mind bold and free. The &s;oldier, whom water could not have kept from flight, having drank wine, boldly meets death, and bravely fights. By wine, are begot|ten witty &s;allies, and happy turns of ex|pre&s;&s;ion &s;pontaneou&s;ly come from the lips; thus wine has been e&s;teemed the <HI>pega&s;us</HI> of poets, and fable has combined Bacchus with the Paphian queen, regarding wine as a principal &s;upport of love's empire.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI. But if this beneficent liquor, when drank with moderation, relieves our inquietudes, in&s;pires bravery, gaiety and candour; what terrible effects are pro|duced by its exce&s;s! Convul&s;ive motions, palpitation of the heart, contortion of the whole body, violent agitations of the &s;oul, fury, alienation of mind, lo&s;s of &s;enti|ment, of remembrance and wi&s;dom, the&s;e are its too common effects.</P>
<P N="37">XXXVII. What power have other ali|ments likewi&s;e on the &s;oul! Let the Man, who burns for amorous embraces, and
<PB N="31" REF="34">who&s;e imagination is bu&s;ied with the charms of the fair &s;ex, be fed for twenty days only with aliments impregnated with acid or nitrous particles; and you will ob&s;erve his pa&s;&s;ion to decay with his &s;trength. Give him afterwards gelati|nous and &s;pirituous aliments, immediate|ly his imagination is revived and his pa&s;&s;ion renewed with its former force.</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. Aliments affect not the &s;oul by their quality only, but by their quan|tity likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>On ri&s;ing from a plentiful table, Man is not the &s;ame as when he fir&s;t &s;at down thereto.</P>
<P>After eating, the pul&s;e becomes quick|er, we feel a pre&s;&s;ure at the region of the &s;tomach, the body is dull and li&s;tle&s;s, the mind becomes &s;ad and heavy, it is no longer adapted for meditation, or &s;allies of wit; we yawn, and at la&s;t fall fa&s;t a|&s;leep.</P>
<P N="39">XXXIX. The effect produced on the &s;oul by exce&s;s of wine, is occa&s;ioned like|wi&s;e by a &s;mall quantity of the <HI>&s;olanum verum.</HI></P>
<P>Scarce is it di&s;&s;olved in the &s;tomach, when the members become convul&s;ed, the
<PB N="32" REF="35">ge&s;tures wild and the looks full of fury; the <HI>Ri&s;us Sardonicus</HI> &s;ucceeds and tears begin to flow; in the mean time, the wretched &s;ufferer &s;tammers out many extravagant expre&s;&s;ions, is furious, and endeavours to bite or tear any object that happens to be near him.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;emina hyo&s;ciami &amp; aturae indicae,</HI> deprive the per&s;on that eats them of the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es: he &s;ees not, even though his eyes are open; he hears not, is &s;tu|pid, without ideas, without &s;entiment; he is not even &s;en&s;ible of his own ex|i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Were I to recount the different virtues of other plants and flowers, which pro|duce &s;imilar effects in the &s;oul, and which render the wi&s;e&s;t furious, and the mo&s;t in|genious &s;tupid; I &s;hould never have done.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect of nature produces on the &s;oul impre&s;&s;ions very different, accord|ing to the objects which offer them&s;elves to the &s;ight.</P>
<P N="40">XL. Who can be in&s;en&s;ible to the plea&s;|ing &s;entiments which ari&s;e in the &s;oul from the pro&s;pect of a beautiful land&s;cape, from the view of a fine country, enlightened with the parting rays of the &s;un in the evening
<PB N="33" REF="36">of a &s;erene day? We feel a &s;udden joy, a &s;atisfaction which cannot be expre&s;&s;ed. The rich foliage of the trees, the enamel and per&s;umes of the flowers, the harmoni|ous chant of birds, and the coolne&s;s of the evening breeze, in&s;en&s;ibly beget gaiety in the heart, we feel a &s;weet &s;erenity &s;teal upon the mind, we undergo a kind of enchantment, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know we are not at all times in an equal di&s;po|&s;ition to receive this joy, to feel the&s;e plea&s;ing emo|tions; there are moments in which we tenaciou&s;ly re|tain in the heart &s;ome perplexing &s;entiment of &s;adne&s;s, which we continually carry about with us.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="41">XLI. As the pro&s;pect of a fine country, of a plea&s;ing rural rece&s;s, is adapted to in&s;pire us with joy; &s;o the pro&s;pect of a di&s;mal de&s;ert, is adapted to in&s;pire us with &s;adne&s;s.</P>
<P>Plains without flowers, without her|bage, covered with arid &s;and; trees bla&s;ted or ob&s;cured with gloomy foliage; enor|mous ma&s;&s;es of rocks dive&s;ted of verdure and grown black with age; the noi&s;e of torrents ru&s;hing from the &s;ummit of moun|tains, together with the croaking of ra|vens and mournful cries of eagles, are hi|deous
<PB N="34" REF="37">objects, which convey &s;adne&s;s to the heart though all the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P N="42">XLII. As the pro&s;pect of nature, &s;o the air affects the &s;oul in different manners, according to its different temperature.</P>
<P>Is the atmo&s;phere thick and heavy? We feel a &s;adne&s;s at the heart, which vani&s;hes as &s;oon as the air is re&s;tored to its wonted &s;erenity. In the mo&s;t delightful retire|ment, we are obnoxious to the influence of the atmo&s;phere, and are gay or &s;ad, according as the heavens are cloudy or &s;e|rene. The air even affects our &s;en&s;ibility and under&s;tanding: in cold and dry wea|ther, the mind is much more active, more penetrating than when it is hot or humid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Milton's genius was &s;ublime during the fir&s;t and la&s;t months of the year only; at other times, his ima|gination was oppre&s;&s;ed; he was then not &s;uperior to other men.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus &s;eeing that the &s;oul is &s;ubject to phy&s;ical laws, and is under the influence of the heavens and earth, we might be indu|ced to believe that Man is wholly material. Feeble &s;port of the air, and &s;ea&s;ons! The &s;un and clouds, heat and cold, dry and humid: the&s;e regulate his character, the complexion
<PB N="35" REF="38">of his mind and his genius; and he is gay or &s;ad, &s;agacious or &s;tupid, according to the influence of the winds and meteors.</P>
<P N="43">XLIII. Agreeable &s;en&s;ations not only generate a &s;entiment of love or of joy in our hearts, they likewi&s;e produce a plea&s;|ing calm.</P>
<P>If fatigued during the heat of &s;ummer, we repo&s;e our&s;elves beneath the branches of a tree, which, by its thick foliage, defends us from the rays of the &s;un; em|ployed in viewing the enamel of the mea|dows and a variety of delightful objects which then pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our &s;ight, the gentle zephyrs with their cooling breezes refre&s;h us, the murmur of brooks, the &s;weet perfume of flowers, the amo|rous chant of birds delight the ear, and the who&s;e &s;oul is drowned in plea&s;ure: engro&s;&s;ed by &s;weet &s;en&s;ations, the mind gradually cea&s;es to contemplate the ob|jects of its delights; already thought has abandoned it, the other faculties are &s;u&s;|pended, and, by an unknown charm, we &s;ink into a voluptuous repo&s;e: the bo|dy partakes in this enchanting calm; and, as if it were incapable of watching one moment without its companion, the head
<PB N="36" REF="39">reclines, the eyes clo&s;e, and &s;leep creeps on all the &s;en&s;es.</P>

<P>If the power of the body over the &s;oul be very great, the power of the &s;oul over the body is very great likewi&s;e. By a &s;imple act of volition, the &s;oul moves the limbs either &s;eparately or all together. In pa&s;&s;ions, it affects the body in a thou&s;and different manners; at one time, it con|tracts either every part at once, or &s;ome particular parts only; at another, it relaxes them, and deprives them of their tone, and &s;ometimes it &s;o far agitates our organs, di&s;turbing and varying their oeconomy, as wholly to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>The power of the &s;oul over the body, is as immediate as that of the body over the &s;oul, but not as complete. It has, indeed, a direct power on the organs of voluntary motion, but not on tho&s;e of
<PB N="37" REF="40">life; if at any time it affect the&s;e, it is only indirectly by their connexion with the organs &s;ubject to the will, or by the corre&s;pondence of the nervous &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Neither is the power of the &s;oul over the body as continual as that of the body over the &s;oul; the influence of the body on the &s;oul is permanent; the influence of the &s;oul on the body only momentary; and what is &s;urpri&s;ing, the body is never &s;ubordinate to the whole &s;oul, but only to &s;ome one of its faculties exclu&s;ively.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore examine the influence of the &s;oul on our organs in its different points of view, neglecting that of the will, of which I have already treated when di&s;cour&s;ing of the mechani&s;m of the human body.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions cannot continue confined within the heart: they manife&s;t them&s;elves outwardly in the &s;ound of the voice, in the rapidity of the &s;peech, in the ge&s;ture, in the po&s;ture of the body, in the &s;tate of its functions; and always differently, according to the nature of the motions agitating the &s;oul.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. Love, who&s;e empire extends over univer&s;al nature; that violent and
<PB N="38" REF="41">tender &s;entiment, &s;o celebrated by the poets, &s;o well known to lovers, produces &s;trong emotions in the organs of plea&s;ure, excites a gentle heat in the region of the diaphragm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In tho&s;e va&s;cular and nervous parts, termed by anatomi&s;ts <HI>plexus cardiacus.</HI></NOTE>, tender looks, quick pul&s;a|tion, adds lu&s;tre to the eyes, envilens the complexion, embelli&s;hes the countenance, animates the features, and communicates a grace to all our motions.</P>
<P N="45">XLV. In friend&s;hip, the &s;oul affects the body in the &s;ame manner, the &s;ymp|toms of the organs of plea&s;ure excepted<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">We mu&s;t not confound friend&s;hip with love. Till the time when the organs of &s;ex are perfectly deve|loped, Man knows only the fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;entiments; he may indeed love a female, but his affection is only &s;uch as he has for his friends; it being only by the &s;e|cret emotions of the organs of plea&s;ure that he has the knowledge of this &s;weet attraction of the &s;exes to &s;eek each other's company, and to unite in procreative plea|&s;ures.</NOTE>; nor is it &s;trange it &s;hould, friend&s;hip and love being the &s;ame affection of the &s;oul, and differing only in their object.</P>
<P N="46">XLVI. Joy produces nearly the &s;ame effects with happy love. Whil&s;t the &s;oul
<PB N="39" REF="42">is under the influence of this agreeable &s;entiment, the countenance wears a graci|ous &s;mile, the complexion is lively, the eyes &s;hine with redoubled lu&s;tre, re&s;pira|tion is more free, the body receives new vigour, &s;en&s;ibility is increa&s;ed, and we feel a voluptuous emotion about the heart. Joy, in the &s;ame manner with love, em|belli&s;hes the countenance, animates its features, gives expre&s;&s;ion to its graces, and vivacity to all our actions; it appears like|wi&s;e in our motions, the legs, the arms, the head, are diver&s;ely agitated, as if the body and &s;oul were not &s;ufficiently capaci|ous to contain its tran&s;ports.</P>
<P>Such are the effects of moderate joy; when the pa&s;&s;ion is extreme, they are ter|rible: an exce&s;s of plea&s;ure affects us with languor, &s;tupifies the &s;en&s;es, di&s;orders the motion of our organs, and nearly deprives us of all &s;entiment; for Man faints through exce&s;s of joy, as he does through extreme pain.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. How different are the effects of moderate joy from tho&s;e of &s;adne&s;s! Is the &s;oul overwhelmed with &s;adne&s;s? The countenance is pallid, the eyes lo&s;e their vivacity, the mu&s;cles of the face relax;
<PB N="40" REF="43">we feel a ten&s;ion in the region of the heart, a weight on the diaphragm; the circulation is impeded and becomes lan|guid, our &s;trength fails us, and all the bo|dy is affected with a &s;tupor.</P>
<P N="48">XLVIII. The effects of fear on the bo|dy are analogous to tho&s;e of &s;adne&s;s. In fear, the limbs are affected with a vio|lent tremor, the blood congeals in its ve&s;&s;els, our &s;trength fails us, the u&s;e of the &s;en&s;es is &s;u&s;pended, the voice dies away on the lips, languor arre&s;ts our motions, our organs are in a &s;tupor, and all their oeconomy is di&s;ordered.</P>
<P>When fear is extreme, it gives youth the marks of decrepitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hair of &s;ome per&s;ons has been ob&s;erved to turn grey in&s;tantaneou&s;ly through extreme fear.</NOTE>; it extingui&s;hes the lamp of life. In &s;ome, this pa&s;&s;ion has anticipated the executioner and the ene|my. The Man who has had his irons knocked off after condemnation to receive a pardon, has been found dead through exce&s;s of fear. Another falls lifele&s;s at the &s;ight of an enemy, whom he is going to encounter.</P>
<P N="49">XLIX. If, when the body is extremely agitated, the &s;oul enjoys no repo&s;e; &s;o
<PB N="41" REF="44">neither does the body enjoy any when the &s;oul is &s;trongly affected.</P>
<P>When night has wrapped all things in her &s;able mantle, Man is not always &s;ure of re&s;t. Whil&s;t all other creatures enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of repo&s;e, or &s;eek the gratifi|cation of pre&s;ent wants, Man is the only one to whom care denies &s;leep. The black de&s;pair and heart-corroding remor&s;e, which agitate his &s;oul during the day, ac|company him amid&s;t the ob&s;curity of the night, will not &s;uffer him to clo&s;e his eyes, and harra&s;s his body continually.</P>
<P>When the &s;oul is &s;trongly affected, want of &s;leep exhau&s;ts the la&s;t remains of bo|dily &s;trength. Thus the tender mother, when her only &s;on langui&s;hes on the bed of &s;ickne&s;s, pa&s;&s;es whole nights and days watching her beloved child, and will ad|mit of no con&s;olation. A prey to grief, &s;he enjoys no repo&s;e; her body is exhau&s;|ted by fatigue, and a mortal languor &s;ucceeds.</P>
<P>If every pa&s;&s;ion makes different im|pre&s;&s;ions on the body; the &s;oul, at once agitated by different emotions, produces likewi&s;e on our organs particular impre&s;|&s;ions, as may be remarked in terror, fear,
<PB N="42" REF="45">hopele&s;s love, and in the other compound pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P N="50">L. The tender virgin who &s;ees her lover &s;truck dead at her feet, at once &s;eiz|ed by fear and &s;adne&s;s, continues immove|able; a cold &s;weat flows down her face, her di&s;coloured lips are affected with an involuntary tremor, her cheeks lo&s;e their colour, her arms are extended, her tear|le&s;s eyes are immoveably fixed on the life|le&s;s body; &s;he &s;tands &s;peechle&s;s, a&s;toni&s;h|ed, immoveable, as if contemplating the greatne&s;s of her mi&s;ery. To &s;ee her mournful looks, and to view her in this extremity of grief, who would not imagine her in&s;en&s;ible? Soon her organs become le&s;s ten&s;e, her pul&s;e concentrated gradually becomes more free, her brea&s;t heaves with frequent &s;ighs, &s;he flings her|&s;elf on the dead corps, bedews it with her tears, ki&s;&s;es tho&s;e eyes which are now clo&s;ed in the &s;leep of death, cla&s;ps within her arms his cold remains, and fills the air with her lamentation.</P>
<P>There are ca&s;es, wherein the effects of this pa&s;&s;ion on the body are yet more &s;trong.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="46">In the war which Ferdinand made on the queen of Hungary, a young warrior, who had greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in an engagement near Buda, was carried dead from the field; Ra&s;ciac, an officer in the &s;ame army, on viewing the body, per|ceives it to be his own &s;on, grows pale and expires<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the E&s;&s;ays of Montaigne.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="51">LI. In attention, that is, in curio&s;ity mixed with hope or fear, we are agitated, we hear, we ob&s;erve every circum&s;tance. At the lea&s;t noi&s;e the heart beats, the eyes are &s;ometimes fixed, and &s;ometimes wandering. Should the object appear, we are &s;eized with a palpitation of heart yet more violent, re&s;piration is ob&s;tructed, the voice faulters, and the functions of the &s;en&s;es are interrupted.</P>
<P N="52">LII. Anger, that &s;ingular affection wherein grief, hatred and de&s;ire of revenge are confounded, produces very different effects on the organs, according to the &s;en|timents then affecting the &s;oul. At one time, it &s;preads a death-like palene&s;s over the countenance, and agitates the body with convul&s;ive motions and involuntary
<PB N="44" REF="47">tremors. At others, it gives ela&s;tici|ty to our mu&s;cles, lends us new force, and for &s;ome moments rai&s;es us above our|&s;elves. The&s;e impetuous motions of the &s;oul are mo&s;t &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed in the countenance, the looks are wild and fu|rious, the mouth foams, the voice is in|terrupted and hoar&s;e, the brow &s;evere, the whole face is inflamed and wears a me|nacing air.</P>
<P>In rage or exce&s;&s;ive anger Man becomes frantic, his motions impetuous, his limbs lo&s;e their flexibility, and his body is violently contorted: the &s;oul at that time rai&s;es a ferment in the blood, ju&s;t as im|petuous winds rou&s;e the waves of the &s;ea.</P>
<P N="53">LIII. Terror, that painful emotion ex|cited in the &s;oul by fearful exclamations, the cries of fury or the &s;ight of imminent danger, and always compounded of dread of the object terrifying us, and an uncon|querable de&s;ire to avoid it, produces like|wi&s;e very different effects on the &s;oul. At times, we feel an univer&s;al tremor, an ex|treme weakne&s;s, a general &s;tupor, which di&s;able the body from obeying the &s;oul, and &s;u&s;pend the u&s;e of our &s;en&s;ations; the voice faulters and dies on the lips, we
<PB N="45" REF="48">make many ineffectual efforts to fly, lan|guor prevents us from moving, and this &s;tupor of the organs &s;ometimes, though but &s;eldom, de&s;troys their mechani&s;m. At other times, in&s;tead of being thus di&s;|ordered, this pa&s;&s;ion gives us vigor, ren|ders us more alert, and endues us with a more than common force.</P>
<P N="54">LIV. And here let us ob&s;erve, that every violent pa&s;&s;ion, which begins by increa&s;ing the &s;trength of the body, in the end affects it with languor: rage at fir&s;t makes a &s;urprizing addition to our &s;trength; but this force &s;oon fails us, we experience a weakne&s;s, which deprives us both of the will and of the power of making new efforts; at that time, being incapable of any vigorous act, we become languid and dejected.</P>
<P N="55">LV. How different is happy and un|happy love! The haple&s;s fair one, at once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with love and filled with de&s;pair, con&s;umed with eager de&s;ires, and de|prived of him who alone can make her happy, abandoned to her melancholy thoughts, condemned to &s;pend her life in bewailing her hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, and in
<PB N="46" REF="49">feeding on her own afflictions, at fir&s;t perceives a ten&s;ion about the diaphragm, a violent heat in the region of the heart, and a fever is kindled up in her veins. When the heat of her pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;ides, her &s;oul &s;uccumbs under its mi&s;ery, a con|&s;uming fire rages within, and deprives her of the &s;weets of repo&s;e, her &s;trength fails her, grief preys upon her bloom and im|pairs her health. The fire which once &s;parkled in her eyes is now extingui&s;hed, grown heavy and dim, the light &s;eems o|dious and painful, her limbs tremble and &s;ink under her weight, and &s;he can hardly &s;upport her&s;elf; the ro&s;es and lillies leave her wan cheeks, her forehead is covered with wrinkles, and her face wears the marks of age. Some|times her whole countenance is flu&s;tered with a glowing red, involuntary tears trickle down her cheeks; and &s;o exce&s;&s;ive is her mi&s;ery, that &s;he is wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the &s;en&s;e of her &s;ufferings, and is in|&s;en&s;ible to every thing be&s;ides.</P>
<P N="56">LVI. The violent pa&s;&s;ions not only af|fect the oeconomy of our organs; they appear outwardly in involuntary motions, and mechanical impre&s;&s;ions. The arms,
<PB N="47" REF="50">legs, head, and even the whole body take different po&s;itions, according to the dif|ferent motions which actuate us. In &s;hame, the head inclines forward; in &s;adne&s;s on one &s;ide; in pride it is erect, it is drawn back in a&s;toni&s;hment, and in hatred and indignation it moves from &s;ide to &s;ide in different ways. In anger, as in joy, the whole body is agitated with various precipitate motions.</P>
<P N="57">LVII. The pa&s;&s;ions do not always act in concert; they &s;ometimes act in op|po&s;ition to each other; accordingly, in the&s;e conflicts, they affect the body in different ways.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve that man, under &s;ome affliction of mind, which he would fain &s;mother within his own brea&s;t. In this &s;tate, the violence of the motions which actuate him, and the efforts he makes to conceal his trouble, occa&s;ion a burning heat, a &s;en|&s;ation of heavine&s;s in the head, and a kind of ebriety which makes hi &s;carcely know him&s;elf. His eyes &s;parkle with rage, his countenance is inflamed, he feels an op|pre&s;&s;ion at his brea&s;t, which ob&s;tructs re&s;|piration. Should he, during this inward &s;truggle, meet with any thing which ag|gravates
<PB N="48" REF="51">his trouble; unable to re&s;i&s;t the emotions of his &s;oul, his limbs are va|riou&s;ly agitated, he gives way to his fury, and utters terrible cries with a broken and faultering voice. This frenzy is frequently &s;ucceeded by more violent &s;ymptoms; whil&s;t the paroxy&s;m la&s;ts, he reels, falls, remains motionle&s;s, becomes in&s;en&s;ible, and has not even any &s;en&s;e of what he &s;uffers.</P>
<P N="58">LVIII. Although in the&s;e different pa&s;|&s;ions the &s;oul affects differently every part of the body, yet in none are they more vi&s;i|ble than in the countenance, in none they di&s;play them&s;elves with greater energy.</P>
<P>When the &s;oul is calm, all the parts of the countenance are in a &s;tate of re&s;t; their union then produces a plea&s;ing har|mony, which corre&s;ponds with the calm within. But when the &s;oul is agitated, the face becomes a living table, whereon every pa&s;&s;ion is delineated in the different features with equal exactne&s;s and ex|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In joy, the eyes acquire new lu&s;tre, the complexion brightens, the brows become more arched, the no&s;trils expand, the corners of the mouth &s;omewhat recede
<PB N="49" REF="52">from each other, the cheeks are gently contracted, and the lips formed into a gra|cious &s;mile.</P>
<P>In &s;adne&s;s, the eyes become dead and fixed, the pupil is half rai&s;ed and half hid by the eye-lid, which is a little de|pre&s;&s;ed, the cheeks are pale, the corners of the mouth fall, the lower lip is pro|truded upwards, the other mu&s;cles of the face are relaxed, the vi&s;age is lengthen|ed, the eyes are &s;woln, and dimmed by a copious moi&s;ture which is afterwards di&s;charged in tears.</P>
<P>In &s;hame and in mode&s;ty, the mu&s;cles of the face are contracted, the eyes are turned downwards, and covered with the eye-lids, the mouth is &s;omewhat open, and the complexion of a deeper red.</P>
<P>If every pa&s;&s;ion is expre&s;&s;ed on the countenance by different lineaments, the concour&s;e of the&s;e different lineaments is properly adapted to expre&s;s the mixed pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In terror and affright, the forehead becomes wrinkled, the eye-brows are ele|vated in the parts towards the temples, and are depre&s;&s;ed at the other extremity; the eye-lids are wide open, leaving the
<PB N="50" REF="53">pupil and half the white bare, the lips are drawn back at their extremities, the mouth is open, and all the mu&s;cles of the face appear contracted and &s;trongly mark|ed. In contempt and deri&s;ion, the upper lip is drawn &s;omewhat on one &s;ide, &s;o that the teeth appear; in the other is ob&s;erved a &s;mall motion, faintly re&s;embling a &s;mile, the no&s;e is drawn to the &s;ame &s;ide with the upper lip, the eye on that &s;ide is half &s;hut; whil&s;t the other continues unchanged, the pupil of both being depre&s;&s;ed as when we look downwards.</P>
<P>Of all the parts of the face, the eye is the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive. This is the only organ wherein Man cannot conceal the pa&s;&s;ion in his brea&s;t. The different pa&s;|&s;ions are expre&s;&s;ed by a &s;udden alteration in the eyes; in the&s;e appear complacency, envy, rage, fury, contempt, trouble, an|xiety, de&s;pair, in all their various grada|tions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This expre&s;&s;ion of the eye is owing in great part to the different movements of the <HI>Palpebrae</HI> and the adjacent parts.</NOTE>. In the&s;e too we may read vexa|tion, and di&s;couragement; in a word, every affection of the &s;oul is reflected by the&s;e admirable organs, as the images of ob|jects
<PB N="51" REF="54">by a well poli&s;hed mirror; even the mo&s;t &s;ecret emotions of the heart are ma|nife&s;ted by them.</P>
<P>Every one mu&s;t have ob&s;erved the re|&s;traint of two lovers on the intru&s;ion of a third per&s;on. When they cannot freely indulge the mutual emotion of their hearts, what expre&s;&s;ion! What eloquence in the eye; at that time the &s;ole interpre|ter of their &s;entiments! How in&s;tanta|neou&s;ly does the &s;oul di&s;play it&s;elf in the motions of the&s;e organs? Their pa&s;&s;ions, their de&s;igns, their hopes, their fears are expre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ingle glance.</P>
<P>But it is time to leave the con&s;ideration of the influence of the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;oul on the body, and to examine that of the under&s;tanding thereon.</P>
<P N="59">LIX. Reflection fatigues the mind in|comparably more, and much &s;ooner than mu&s;ing or revery. The exerci&s;e of rea&s;on is to the &s;oul, what voluntary motion is to the body, a &s;tate of contention and con|&s;traint.</P>
<P N="60">LX. When the &s;oul is concentrated within it&s;elf, and wrapped in profound thought, we perceive a ten&s;ion in the <HI>plexus cordiacus,</HI> in the membranes of the
<PB N="52" REF="55">brain, but e&s;pecially in the parts &s;urround|ing the eyes. This ten&s;ion is accompa|panied with a &s;en&s;ation of heat, which may be removed by the action of the cold air; the pul&s;e is quicker than common, the countenance becomes more florid, and the brea&s;t heaves with &s;trong re&s;pira|tion, as may be remarked in &s;tudious per|&s;ons, or in men of &s;trong &s;en&s;ations, when under any violent affection of the mind, and when they are obliged to retire with|in them&s;elves, to enjoy &s;ome &s;ecret plea|&s;ure or to fea&s;t upon their &s;orrow.</P>
<P>In a more continual application, the mind is affected with a &s;tupor, or a kind of ebriety, the power of the &s;oul on the or|gans of voluntary motion is dimini&s;hed, and the will lo&s;es its empire over the body.</P>
<P N="61">LXI. How great is the power likewi&s;e which the imagination has over the body! How &s;ingular the relation between this fa|culty of the &s;oul and our organs!</P>
<P>It is by this that a good mimic affects the &s;u&s;ceptible &s;pectator, and makes him follow his motions, his ge&s;tures, his actions mechanically, ju&s;t as if his body were &s;ubject to be moved by the motions of the other.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="56">It is by this the idea of delicate meats &s;ets the organs of ta&s;te in motion, and, as it is commonly expre&s;&s;ed, makes the mouth water. It is by this we experience that in|&s;upportable &s;en&s;ation, which we feel when we are touched even on tho&s;e parts which are the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible, with de&s;ign to excite titillation. It is the imagination, which, in|flamed by voluptuous ideas and images, or by the &s;ight of beauty, quickens the pul&s;e, increa&s;es the lu&s;tre of the eye, excites &s;trong emotions in the organs of plea&s;ure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The erection of the <HI>penis</HI> in man, and of the <HI>Clytoris</HI> in woman, are not voluntary motions. This mechani&s;m of the parts ab&s;olutely depends on the ima|gination: how many men are languid and impotent in the company of a woman, for whom they have no af|fection; notwith&s;tanding every effort of the will, and &s;ometimes every aid of art!</NOTE>, and cau&s;es palpitation of the heart.</P>
<P>It is this, which in love kindles our de|&s;ires, produces on the lips of lovers that &s;en&s;ation of a lambent flame, which ac|companies their ki&s;&s;es, and renders their touch &s;imilar to that of fire.</P>
<P>It is this, which cau&s;es that tremor the lover experiences at the approaching en|joyment of his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>It is this which, in the ardour of youth,
<PB N="54" REF="57">grati&s;ies the voluptuou&s;ne&s;s of de&s;ire, in our dreams.</P>
<P>But the power of the imagination is not confined to any particular organ, it is extended over the whole body. There have been convul&s;ioni&s;ts, who, by the help of a warm imagination, have rai&s;ed them&s;elves by degrees to fury: their eyes were in|flamed, the face disfigured by a violent contraction of its mu&s;cles, the mouth foam|ing, and all their members convul&s;ed.</P>
<P>However great this power which ima|gination has over the body may be, phi|lo&s;ophers have fancied it much greater than it really is. Not content with the prodigies of nature, they have attributed to it others, which are merely ideal.</P>
<P>Led a&s;ide, on one hand, by appearances; on the other, by the love of the marvel|lous, like the &s;tupid vulgar, they have adopted ridiculous prejudices, and em|ployed their pens in defending them.</P>
<P>We are told of a pregnant woman in Germany, who being &s;truck with the &s;ight of a picture of John Bapti&s;t, which hung in her bed-chamber, was afterwards delivered of an infant with its whole body hairy, and &s;ome phy&s;iologi&s;ts, treating
<PB N="55" REF="58">this ab&s;urdity as an a&s;&s;ured fact, con|cluded, that the imagination could change the form of the &s;olids, the features of the countenance, and the colour of the &s;kin.</P>
<P>This opinion was implicitly believed, and is at pre&s;ent univer&s;ally received. From thence it is pretended, that whatever af|fects the mother, affects the foetus like|wi&s;e; that the affections of the &s;oul of the one, act on the body of the other; to this energy are atributed the re&s;em|blance of children to their parents, tho&s;e blemi&s;hes on the &s;kin, and all tho&s;e mon|&s;trous productions wherein nature appears to have forgotten the wi&s;dom of her own laws. They even carry their love of the marvellous &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ert, that the foetus bears the real marks and repre&s;entation of the longings of the mother, as of fruits and the like which &s;he may have eager|ly de&s;ired. But if we attentively examine the&s;e marks and blemi&s;hes, the&s;e pretended &s;igns of the mother's di&s;tempered imagi|nation, we &s;hall perceive them to be only &s;anguine&s;tains, and yellow or reddi&s;h &s;pots<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e marks are always yellow or of a red or vio|let colour, tints which the blood naturally gives to the &s;kin; when it enters in too great quantity into its va&s;cular texture, and when it is more or le&s;s fluid, thick, or bilious, and likewi&s;e according to its mixture with the nervous fluid, or &s;ome other of the liquors of the body.</NOTE>,
<PB N="56" REF="59">more or le&s;s &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed, produced by &s;ome change in the texture of the &s;kin. <Q>The&s;e &s;pots have a&s;&s;uredly &s;ome figure; becau&s;e every &s;pot mu&s;t have one, and this figure mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily bear a re|&s;emblance to &s;omething: but they have neither the form of any fruit, nor that of any object which the mo|ther could de&s;ire.</Q> I have &s;een many &s;uch pretended repre&s;entations of the mo|ther's longings, but could never ob&s;erve in them any thing more.</P>
<P>By inve&s;tigating the cau&s;es of the&s;e pre|judices, we &s;hall find, as I have already remarked, that erroneous ob&s;ervations only could have given birth thereto. Not only the facts are fal&s;e, but even &s;uppo&s;ing they were true, they cannot be produced by the cau&s;es to which they have been attri|buted.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay, to prove this, that as our &s;en&s;ations re&s;emble not their objects, it is impo&s;&s;ible that de&s;ire can produce phy&s;ical
<PB N="57" REF="60">repre&s;entations of tho&s;e objects; I have more convincing proofs to adduce.</P>
<P>The &s;oul affects the body undoubtedly in every pa&s;&s;ion, and always differently, according to the diver&s;ity of its emotions; but it has been evidently demon&s;trated, that the &s;oul has no influence on the body, but by the nervous fluid; that this power over the body is reduced to the dilating or contracting our &s;olids, to the accelerating or retarding the o&s;cillatory motion of the organs of circulation in different degrees, &s;ometimes even &s;o as to de&s;troy the motion of the whole machine; and that it has no other power over the fluid of the nerves, but to alter its quality and deprave it, that is, to render it cau&s;tic or de&s;troy its ener|gy. Now the empire of the &s;oul over the body which it inhabits, being thus li|mited, can it be more exten&s;ive over a body to which it is not &s;o clo&s;ely united? For it is well known, that the <HI>foetus</HI> has no direct or immediate communication with the mother; whil&s;t it is in the womb, it is inclo&s;ed within membranes, which ad|here not to the <HI>uterus</HI> in the fir&s;t months of pregnancy, nor is their adhe&s;ion very great when pregnancy is farther advanced.
<PB N="58" REF="61">The placenta being connected to the uterus by papillae on the external part of the membranes in&s;erted into the &s;mall fora|mina of this organ and joined by a mucila|ginous matter, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o &s;mall a de|gree of adhe&s;ion, that it &s;carcely <HI>appends</HI> to the matrix; the <HI>foetus</HI> therefore, in &s;ome re&s;pects, is intirely independent of the mo|ther.</P>
<P>It has been for a long time believed, that the blood of the mother pa&s;&s;es into the body of the <HI>foetus,</HI> by means of the <HI>placenta</HI> and <HI>funis umbilicalis;</HI> it has been &s;uppo&s;ed likewi&s;e, that the blood ve&s;&s;els of the uterus open into the&s;e foramina, and the ve&s;&s;els of the placenta into the&s;e papillae, and that their ve&s;&s;els communi|cate with each other. But experience has convinced us of the error of this opinion; for, by injecting the arteries of the <HI>funis umbilicalis,</HI> the liquor injected wholly re|turns by the veins, nor does the lea&s;t part of it e&s;cape into tho&s;e parts, with which they are &s;uppo&s;ed to communicate. Be|&s;ides, we may ea&s;ily detract the&s;e papillae from their foramina, without producing any efflux of blood, either from the ute|rus or the placenta, there being di&s;charg|ed
<PB N="59" REF="62">from one to the other a lacteal fluid only, which &s;erves for nouri&s;hment to the foetus.</P>
<P>The foetus therefore has nothing in common with the mother but this nu|tritive lymph. They have di&s;tinct and &s;eparate organs and functions; nor has the mother any influence over the foetus, but by means of this liquor. Every alteration of this nutritive, received from the mo|ther, is therefore communicated to the foetus: if it be corrupt, the &s;olids and flu|ids of the foetus are &s;o likewi&s;e; but the fluids of the mother cannot otherwi&s;e af|fect it, It is not therefore to the imagi|nation of the mother that we mu&s;t attri|bute tho&s;e re&s;emblances, tho&s;e mutilations, tho&s;e duplicities of part, tho&s;e cutaneous blemi&s;hes which infants bring with them into the world, and which have been com|monly regarded as true repre&s;entations of the depraved appetites of women, during pregnancy.</P>
<P N="62">LXII. Let us conclude with one im|portant ob&s;ervation. If we compare the power of the different faculties of the &s;oul over the body, we &s;hall be convinced, that this power is not equal in every one:
<PB N="60" REF="63">that of &s;en&s;ibility is much greater than that of the under&s;tanding, and this much greater than that of the will. If the powers of the&s;e faculties be not equally great, &s;o neither are they equally exten|&s;ive. Tho&s;e of &s;en&s;ibility and under&s;tand|ing are univer&s;al; they extend not only to the nervous fibres, but al&s;o to the fibrillae of which they are compo&s;ed, that is, to the organs of &s;en&s;e and tho&s;e of motion: the empire of the will, on the contrary, is confined to this latter, &s;ince tho&s;e two faculties can augment or extingui&s;h our vigour, whil&s;t the will can only extend our organs and contract our mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>Such is in general the influence of the &s;oul on the body, and of the body on the &s;oul; &s;uch the reciprocal relations of tho&s;e two &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>Although the&s;e relations are very evi|dent, many of them have e&s;caped ob&s;er|vation; and of tho&s;e who have ob&s;erved any, the greater number have been content with only ob&s;erving them. Some philo&s;ophers have attempted in vain to account for the&s;e phenomena: others, di&s;gu&s;ted at the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the former, have regarded them as impenetrable my&s;|teries,
<PB N="61" REF="64">&s;o that every one is &s;atisfied at pre|&s;ent, with &s;imply ob&s;erving and admiring this influence; they cry it up as prodigy, as if we were prohibited to pa&s;s beyond the line which tho&s;e &s;ages have drawn; they likewi&s;e attribute their ill &s;ucce&s;s to the nature of the di&s;covery, rather than to the erroneous methods which they have employed in pur&s;uit of it.</P>
<P>After the vain efforts of &s;o many great geniu&s;es, notwith&s;tanding &s;o great a com|bination of prejudices, and the ridicule in|&s;eparable from &s;uch an undertaking, I will venture to attempt the explanation of the&s;e my&s;teries, enter this dark laby|rinth, &s;ound this immen&s;e aby&s;s, and car|ry light into tho&s;e regions of darkne&s;s: I &s;hall a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;ons of this prodigious influence of the &s;oul on the body, and of the body on the &s;oul, di&s;play the unknown principles of their relations, and deter|mine the laws of the&s;e phenomena; in a word, reduce to fixed principles a &s;cience, wherein every thing is yet hypothetic, ob|&s;cure and my&s;terious.</P>

<HEAD>BOOK IV. WHEREIN THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOUL ON THE BODY, AND OF THE BODY ON THE SOUL, IS ACCOUNTED FOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE union of the &s;oul with the bo|dy is &s;ubject of much admira|tion; for in what manner can two &s;ub|&s;tances, &s;o different from each other, be united? How can matter act upon the mind, or the mind upon matter? This is a my&s;tery impenetrable to human under|&s;tanding. Who is &s;o pre&s;umptuous as to undertake the explanation? Human rea|&s;on can never conceive the fir&s;t principles of this intimate union, of this primitive corre&s;pondence of the &s;oul with the body: let us not &s;eek to know after what man|ner two beings, &s;o different in their nature and properties, can act on each other; we mu&s;t admit the fact &s;imply, &s;ince it is unque&s;tionable, but the cau&s;e is whol|ly unknown.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="66">Yet the&s;e different &s;ub&s;tances have &s;in|gular reciprocal relations, and the&s;e rela|tions them&s;elves mu&s;t needs have cau&s;es and principles. The&s;e principles, hither|to unknown, I endeavour to di&s;cover and demon&s;trate; tho&s;e relations, hitherto ob|&s;cure and incomprehen&s;ible, I attempt to account for.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject appears at fir&s;t &s;ight incom|parably more difficult than tho&s;e we have treated of already: in the&s;e we arrive at truth, by a direct and &s;hort way; in the other, on the contrary, concerning which we have hitherto only vague and ab&s;urd conjectures, and where demon&s;tration ap|pears to be impo&s;&s;ible, we may pa&s;s from hypothe&s;is to hypothe&s;is, and blindly pur&s;ue truth in the ocean of opinions, with|out ever attaining it. Yet this is not &s;o difficult a ta&s;k as it appears. The influ|ence of the &s;oul on the body, and of the body on the &s;oul, being invariably the &s;ame, in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, in every individual, and the relations of the&s;e two &s;ub&s;tances being &s;imilar, they are there|fore the effects of cau&s;es which operate in a fixed and invariable manner. As the phenomena are &s;ubordinate to certain
<PB N="64" REF="67">laws, to di&s;cover tho&s;e laws we mu&s;t a&s;|cend from the effects to the cau&s;e, follow|ing the chain of the principal phenomena, collecting &s;imilar facts, comparing and examining them, &s;electing the properties they po&s;&s;e&s;s in common, from tho&s;e pecu|liar to each. Only by this method we can arrive at tho&s;e cau&s;es; without it, the mind wanders in darkne&s;s, perpetually fluctuating between prejudice and probabi|lity, ignorant of the principles of things, and ever confounding the opinions of men with the laws of nature. Such is the method I &s;hall pur&s;ue in the inve&s;tigation of the cau&s;es of the reciprocal influence of the &s;oul and body. I &s;hall therefore collect the chief phenomena, compare them, &s;elect tho&s;e which are &s;imilar, and endeavour to pre&s;ent to the mind a cer|tain number of analogous facts in a &s;ingle point of view. I &s;hall likewi&s;e attempt to di&s;cover their identity, and the cau&s;e of their analogy; and finally, draw from the a&s;&s;emblage of the&s;e different combinations, light &s;ufficient to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es and laws of the admirable harmony &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting betwixt the &s;oul and the body,
<PB N="65" REF="68">&s;o as to conduct us to the important know|ledge of Man.</P>
<P>The&s;e topics being &s;o complicated and &s;o different in their nature, I &s;hall be un|der a kind of nece&s;&s;ity to pay my princi|pal attention to the great and leading ob|jects, reducing the phenomena to &s;ome general heads, avoiding to de&s;cend into mi|nute particulars, a labour as trouble&s;ome to a writer as it is unprofitable to his rea|ders, who are thus continually put to the trouble of collecting them, whil&s;t, after all, they receive only confu&s;ed and imper|fect ideas of the &s;ubject. Be&s;ides, the mind fatigued with a multitude of objects, lo&s;es it&s;elf in the perplexity of its own thoughts, and throws a darkne&s;s on that which it endeavours to elucidate. I &s;hall therefore confine my&s;elf to the &s;olution of the phe|nomena, collecting them into one gene|ral point of view, di&s;regarding tho&s;e mi|nutiae or particular que&s;tions, which might cau&s;e me to lo&s;e &s;ight of the main &s;cope, interrupt the thread of the &s;ubject, and rob demon&s;tration of its evidence.</P>
<P>I &s;hall likewi&s;e endeavour to pre&s;ent my ideas in an order equally ea&s;y to compre|hend, and intere&s;ting to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="69">I am &s;en&s;ible how much my &s;y&s;tem would be improved by an abler pen; but if, notwith&s;tanding the mediocrity of my talents, I can render it acceptable to the reader, by the mere force of that evidence which attends it, I &s;hall both think the opinion I have endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h better grounded, and my &s;atisfaction will be the more complete.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> Influence of the <HI>SOUL</HI> on the <HI>BODY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN the &s;oul is affected by any &s;entiment, it in&s;tantly affects the body, always in the &s;ame manner in every individual, and ever differently according to the nature of its emotions.</P>
<P>The &s;oul has no direct power over our corporeal organs; the &s;oul and body are di&s;tinct beings, without any nece&s;&s;ary con|nexion, and are united by the nervous fluid only<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the article on the &s;tructure of the nerves, Book I.</NOTE>. Thus, in what&s;oever man|ner the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances reciprocally affect each other, the &s;oul never acts on the bo|dy, nor the body on the &s;oul, without the
<PB N="67" REF="70">intervention of this fluid, and never with|out &s;ome impul&s;e being communicated by one to the other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Art. on the action of the &s;oul on the fluid of the nerves, Book I.</NOTE>. On the impul&s;e com|municated to this fluid, on its different degrees of force, combined with the ela&s;|ticity of the fibres, and the different or|gans affected, depend the different pheno|mena ob&s;erved in the influence of the &s;oul on the body. Let us apply this princi|ple to the effects of the pa&s;&s;ions on our organs.</P>
<P>In joy, the countenance acquires a more lively colour, the eyes &s;parkle with an un|u&s;ual lu&s;tre, and the face wears a perpetual &s;mile; a gentle emotion is felt in the re|gions of the heart and <HI>plexus nervo&s;i;</HI> re|&s;piration is more free, circulation more ea&s;y and quick; we receive fre&s;h vigour, all the functions are more perfectly per|formed, and the whole body is full of life.</P>
<P>As the joy is more violent, the&s;e ef|fects are more &s;trong; the arms, legs, head, every member is &s;trongly agitated; the body can &s;carcely contain it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The vivacity of the complexion, the lu&s;tre of the eyes, the liberty and force of
<PB N="68" REF="71">the circulation, the freedom of re&s;pira|tion, and the vigour of the whole body, clearly evince, that in joy the &s;oul forcibly impels a large quantity of the nervous fluid into the organs of motion. This impul&s;e of the fluid of the nerves into the&s;e organs, occa&s;ioning a &s;mall intume&s;cence of the mu&s;cular fibres<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e fibres are the particular organs of motion, as we have already explained when treating of the me|chani&s;m of the human body, under the Art. on the &s;tructure of the mu&s;cles, Book I.</NOTE>, and &s;lightly com|pre&s;&s;ing the fluid which is contained in the fibrillae whereof they are compo&s;ed, gives them the whole of their organic ela&s;ticity; yet cau&s;es not the lea&s;t degree of rigidity. Hence the mu&s;cular motion is ample and &s;trong, the heart and the arteries forcibly impel the blood into the &s;malle&s;t capillaries, and thus communicate to the &s;kin that &s;light intume&s;cence, which then &s;o greatly conduces to beauty, and to that clear and lively colour, which is &s;o greatly orna|mental. The humours of the eye receive a fre&s;h &s;upply of &s;pirits, and their tunics are more fully di&s;tended, whereby they reflect a greater quantity of rays, and ac|quire greater lu&s;tre. In the mu&s;cles of
<PB N="69" REF="72">the cheeks, this impul&s;e is principally to be &s;een; being them &s;upplied with a larger quantity of the nervous fluid, they gently contract, and with the help of the lips expre&s;s an agreeable &s;mile.</P>
<P>But if the fluid of the nerves, in&s;tead of cau&s;ing a &s;light intume&s;cence of the mu&s;cular fibres, &s;hould violently precipitate it&s;elf in great quantity, as it happens in extreme joy; the fibres, being then too greatly di&s;tended, cannot re-act, but they oppo&s;e a too great re&s;i&s;tance to the ela&s;ti|city of the fluid contained in their fibrillae. The&s;e fibrillae are therefore in a &s;tate of rigidity, their fluid is inactive, and the entire organ without organic ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>Hence the rea&s;on why exce&s;s of plea|&s;ure &s;tupifies the &s;en&s;es, affects the body with languor, and even de&s;troys the ac|tion of our organs, when this &s;tate of ri|gidity is extreme.</P>
<P>But in moderate joy, although the &s;oul is not affected with &s;ufficient force to oc|ca&s;ion a rigidity of the fibres, the&s;e emo|tions of the &s;oul produce no durable im|pre&s;&s;ions on the body; this &s;ingular vigour, this flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the machine is of no long continuance, and languor imme|diately
<PB N="70" REF="73">&s;ucceeds. This is ea&s;y to be con|ceived, however &s;trange the&s;e phenomena may appear: for the vigour we experi|ence whil&s;t affected with joy, &s;prings only from the &s;trong influx of the nervous fluid into the organs of motion; this fluid cea&s;es to be determined thereto, when the &s;oul cea&s;es to experience the&s;e agreeable emotions; the fibres thus di&s;tended, de|crea&s;e and collap&s;e when the fluid with which they were di&s;tended is di&s;&s;ipated, and our mu&s;cles are without either tone or ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>It is by a &s;imilar mechani&s;m that the handling of the brea&s;ts of females deprives them of their globular &s;well; it excites a voluptuous emotion in the &s;oul, and in|flames the imagination, which determines the &s;pirits thither in great abundance, di&s;|tends their fibres, increa&s;es their volume, and gives them greater firmne&s;s; but as this determination of &s;pirits is not conti|nual, if the handling be repeated, when this &s;upply has cea&s;ed, the brea&s;ts pre&s;ently collap&s;e and lo&s;e their &s;olidity.</P>
<P>When the &s;oul is overwhelmed with &s;adne&s;s, the complexion becomes wan and pallid, the eyes dull, a ten&s;ion is felt
<PB N="71" REF="74">about the diaphragm, the head inclines for|wards, the arms hang down, unable to &s;upport their own weight, the whole body is affected with languor, we &s;igh, the eyes are &s;uffu&s;ed with tears, &s;ighs are repeated, and tears flow in abundance.</P>
<P>The greater the affliction, the more evident are the&s;e its effects; there is a point to which this pa&s;&s;ion is capable of arriving, and where its violence &s;ometimes extingui&s;hes the lamp of life.</P>
<P>If in joy the &s;oul gives a greater ela&s;|ticity to the mu&s;cles, by determining thereto the fluid of the nerves with im|petuo&s;ity and in abundance; on the con|trary, in &s;adne&s;s it appears to relax the &s;ame organs, cau&s;ing them to collap&s;e, by withdrawing the energetic fluid.</P>
<P>But this is nothing but appearance on|ly; all effects of the &s;oul on the body in this pa&s;&s;ion, as in all the others, are pro|duced by the influx of the nervous fluid, determined into different ducts. In joy, the fluid is impelled from the brain into the cavities of the mu&s;cular fibres. In &s;ad|ne&s;s, it is impelled into the fibrillae of which the&s;e fibres are formed, and which we have &s;hewn to be the proper organs of
<PB N="72" REF="75">&s;en&s;e. In this ca&s;e the nervous fluid di&s;|tends the fibrillae, increa&s;es their diameter, compre&s;&s;es that of the fibres, and de&s;troys the equilibrium, cau&s;ing it to incline to the fibrillae: hence only a &s;mall quantity flows at that time into the organs of mo|tion, and even that can have but little action.</P>
<P>Hence proceeds the weakne&s;s of the mu&s;cles, the languid action of the or|gans, the palene&s;s of the countenance, the dimini&s;hed vivacity of the eyes, and the &s;tupor then affecting the whole body.</P>
<P>The&s;e are however only the effects of a moderate impul&s;e; when this impul&s;e is violent, it occa&s;ions an extreme rigidity of the mu&s;cular fibres<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This rigidity may likewi&s;e be produced by the irritating quality of the nervous fluid, contracted dur|ing this pa&s;&s;ion. But it is evident that nature does not take this method: for in &s;adne&s;s, relaxation immedi|etely &s;ollows this rigidity; whereas the irritating qua|lity of the nervous fluid would have produced a perma|nent rigidity.</NOTE>; this rigidity in|&s;tantly produces a total ce&s;&s;ation of the functions of the body, and con&s;equently death.</P>
<P>But to conceive the effects of &s;adne&s;s properly, we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e which
<PB N="73" REF="76">accompany the impul&s;e of the nervous fluid into our organs, from tho&s;e which &s;ucceed it.</P>
<P>The rigidity of the mu&s;cular fibres is the immediate effect of this impul&s;e, but to this rigidity immediately &s;ucceeds an equal degree of relaxation. The univer&s;al tre|mor affecting us upon hearing of any mi&s;|fortune, the palene&s;s of countenance, the difficulty of re&s;piration, the oppre&s;&s;ion of the diaphragm, concentrated circulation, and the general &s;tupor of the whole body, are evidently the effects of a &s;light rigidity of the fibres. The feeblene&s;s of the mo|tions, the decayed lu&s;tre of the eyes, the relaxation of the mu&s;cles, the lax &s;tate of the &s;kin, and the languor of all the func|tions of the body, are the con&s;equences of that inela&s;ticity which nece&s;&s;ary &s;ucceeds this rigidity. Hence it appears, that ri|gidity and relaxation are the cau&s;es of all the phenomena produced by the influence of the &s;oul on the body in &s;adne&s;s.</P>
<P>Hence Man, in violent affliction, is &s;ub|ject to extreme weakne&s;s; hence &s;ilence and con&s;ternation are the language of the &s;oul when &s;trongly, affected; as are cries and tears, when moderately worked upon.</P>
<Q><PB N="74" REF="77">Curae leves loquuntur, ingentes &s;tupent.</Q>
<P>Hence extreme pain deprives us of &s;en&s;e, of motion, and of life it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Although the &s;oul affect the whole body in different pa&s;&s;ions, yet it affects not all its organs equally: at one time it acts mo&s;t upon the&s;e, at another upon tho&s;e; but the &s;oul principally exerci&s;es its pow|er on the <HI>plexus cardiaci.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e plexus are united to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable blood ve&s;&s;els, &s;uch as the trunks of the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;tomach, liver, &s;pleen, heart, and me&s;entery, which they line with their ramifications. They have likewi&s;e a direct connexion with the brain and organs of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>In &s;adne&s;s, when the&s;e plexus are vio|lently contracted, they forcibly compre&s;s the trunks of the blood ve&s;&s;els which they &s;urround, cau&s;ing the blood to be collect|ed in them, and even occa&s;ioning a total &s;toppage of the circulation.</P>
<P>Hence that compre&s;&s;ion of the heart, that pre&s;&s;ure about the diaphragm, tho&s;e &s;yncopes accompanying the paroxy&s;ms of extreme &s;adne&s;s, and hence even death, which &s;ometimes en&s;ues.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="78">But when the&s;e ramifications of the nervous plexus are only &s;lightly contrac|ted, as in moderate joy, they &s;lightly com|pre&s;s the ve&s;&s;els round which they are wound, but principally the veins, who&s;e coats oppo&s;e the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance; hereby the blood in circulation is &s;omewhat re|&s;trained, particularly in its return to the heart.</P>
<P>Hence the emotions we experience in joy in the region of the diaphragm, and that liveline&s;s of complexion which always accompanies it.</P>
<P>When the emotions produced on the <HI>plexus nervo&s;i</HI> have a certain degree of force, they communicate to the diaphragm, to which the&s;e plexus are united by the diaphragmatic nerve, a tran&s;ient convul&s;ive motion which produces bur&s;ts of laughter: for laughter, which is a &s;ound &s;uddenly interrupted, and frequently re&s;umed, is al|ways produced by a tremor of the dia|phragm. This motion of the diaphragm affects the lungs, which it precipitately elevates and depre&s;&s;es; every time the lungs are depre&s;&s;ed, the air is expelled through the mouth, with a certain noi&s;e;
<PB N="76" REF="79">this is that &s;ound of the voice, which is &s;o often repeated in laughter.</P>
<P>That &s;udden &s;tarting likewi&s;e, and in|ternal con&s;triction, which we experience when we fir&s;t begin to think of &s;ome evil affecting us, is produced by the contrac|tion of the diaphragm, which participates of the nature of the &s;pa&s;m affecting the <HI>plexus nervo&s;i.</HI> This con&s;triction of the diaphragm rai&s;es the lungs, and occa&s;ions that &s;trong expiration, called a <HI>&s;igh.</HI> Whil&s;t the &s;oul continues to think upon any &s;orrowful &s;ubject, it communicates different motions to the plexus, and &s;ighs are frequently repeated. But when new impul&s;es &s;ucceed immediately one after the other, the air ru&s;hes &s;uddenly, and by intervals, into the lungs, produces fre|quent expirations, and every expiration occa&s;ions a &s;ound &s;tronger than &s;ighing: this &s;ound frequently repeated is what is commonly termed <HI>&s;obbing.</HI></P>
<P>When the &s;pa&s;ms begin gradually to dimini&s;h, the air is not expelled &s;o rea|dily from the lungs, expiration is repeated at greater intervals, and produces a louder &s;ound, called <HI>groaning;</HI> for a groan is only a continued &s;ob. Finally, when relax|ation
<PB N="77" REF="80">&s;ucceeds to the&s;e &s;pa&s;ms, tears begin to flow.</P>
<P>Tears are lymph, di&s;tilled from the la|chrymal glands, &s;ituated in the orbit above the le&s;&s;er canthus of the eye.</P>
<P>Each gland has &s;ix or &s;even ducts, which pa&s;s between the membranes of the eye|lids, and open into one common orifice near the <HI>cilia.</HI> From this orifice di&s;tills a &s;aline lymph, which is ab&s;orbed by the <HI>puncta lachrymalia,</HI> and di&s;charged by its proper duct into the no&s;e. But the&s;e glands expre&s;s not this liquor till they be|gin to relax after contraction: hence is the rea&s;on why moderate grief cau&s;es tears to flow, and why exce&s;&s;ive grief &s;u&s;|pends them.</P>
<P>We commonly regard tears as a &s;ign of &s;adne&s;s, but without rea&s;on. They are the effects of every pa&s;&s;ion which con|tracts our fibres; fear, anger, and even joy excite them, as well as &s;adne&s;s and pity.</P>
<P>In fear, as in &s;adne&s;s, there is an uni|ver&s;al tremor, a con&s;triction of the heart, pallor of the countenance, &s;inking of the mu&s;cles, relaxation of the &s;kin, imbe|cility
<PB N="78" REF="81">and &s;tupor. The&s;e &s;imilar effects are produced by the &s;ame mechani&s;m.</P>
<P>Hence lovers, overpowered by their good fortune, remain inactive during the night of their marriage, and recover not their vigour till their a&s;toni&s;hment is di&s;|&s;ipated.</P>
<P>Hence extreme fear &s;u&s;pends tears, and moderate grief abundantly excites them.</P>
<P>Hence fear chills us, &s;tupifies our or|gans, and arre&s;ts our motion.</P>
<P>When fear is extreme, the nervous fluid, being violently precipitated into the fibrillae which form the mu&s;cular fi|bres, de&s;troys the equilibrium between the re&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e fibres and its action, interrupts the regularity of the or|gans of motion, and even at times di&s;or|ders all their functions.</P>
<P>Hence that tremor and numbne&s;s, which deprives us of the u&s;e of our limbs: hence the rea&s;on why a rope-dancer can|not perform tho&s;e feats at the heighth of thirty yards, which he performs with ea&s;e at the heighth of fifteen feet: why &s;ome per&s;ons walk without danger over the roofs of hou&s;es, whil&s;t a&s;leep; whereas they
<PB N="79" REF="82">would have fallen had they been awake, and &s;en&s;ible of their danger.</P>
<P>Hence the bird, which with its warb|ling chears the night in the &s;pring &s;ea&s;on, when it perceives the viper beneath, at|tentively watching to devour it, an ex|treme tremor &s;eizes its feeble organs, a languor deprives them of motion, till at length it can no longer &s;upport it&s;elf, but falls, as if by enchantment, into the open jaws of that deadly reptile.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that the effects of &s;adne&s;s on the body are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of fear; there is however this difference between them. In fear we almo&s;t always perceive a palpitation of heart, which is not per|ceived in &s;adne&s;s. This difference is wholly to be attributed to the greater or le&s;s interval, which pa&s;&s;es in the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions, between the different impul&s;es of the nervous fluid into our organs, and to the greater or le&s;s impetuo&s;ity of the&s;e impul&s;es.</P>
<P>When fear is moderate, the &s;oul is &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively affected by the &s;ame &s;entiment at very &s;hort intervals, and at every repro|duction of this &s;entiment it impels into the nerves (particularly into the plexus ner|vo&s;i)
<PB N="80" REF="83">a fre&s;h &s;upply of fluid, which pro|duces a &s;light &s;pa&s;m; the blood ve&s;&s;els are likewi&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ively ob&s;tructed by the ra|mifications of the plexus which &s;urround them, and the circulation is at intervals interrupted. When the &s;pa&s;m cea&s;es, the blood is violently impelled into the heart, which then becomes overcharged; where|by the circulation is rendered irregular, and the pul&s;e feeble and intermitting. Hence proceeds the cau&s;e of this ten&s;ion at the region of the diaphragm, and of this palpitation of the heart.</P>
<P>In love the eyes gli&s;ter, the complexion is more lively, we feel &s;trong agitations in the organs of plea&s;ure, a heat in the region of the heart, and an increa&s;e of vigour in the whole body.</P>
<P>From the analogy between the effects of love and tho&s;e of joy, it is evident, that in love the &s;oul abundantly &s;upplies the organs of motion, and principally the <HI>plexus ner|vo&s;i</HI> with the nervous fluid, and more e&s;|pecially the plexus with which the ar|teries are interwoven: for the heat, which we then experience about the heart, is produced by the arterial blood collected in this part, by the &s;light contraction of the
<PB N="81" REF="84">ramifications of the plexus which invelope the&s;e ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The &s;oul very &s;ingularly affects the or|gans of plea&s;ure, in love; it even appears, that the&s;e organs are the principal &s;cene of the effects of this pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e parts have, it is well known, an intimate corre &s;pondence with the <HI>&s;emilu|nar plexus,</HI> one of the <HI>plexus cardiaci,</HI> by means of the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els; the ner|vous fluid is abundantly &s;upplied thereto, animates the <HI>mu&s;culi erectores penis,</HI> pro|duces &s;trong agitations in the&s;e parts, and gives the whole organ that ten&s;ion, that turgidne&s;s, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the de&s;ign of nature, and to the plea&s;ures of love.</P>
<P>In friend&s;hip the &s;oul affects the body in the &s;ame manner as in love; the organs of plea&s;ure however experience no parti|cular emotion; except this, the &s;tate of the body is equal, and its mechani&s;m is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Hatred produces effects contrary to tho&s;e of love. When that pa&s;&s;ion is extreme, at the &s;ight of the object of our aver&s;ion we feel a &s;udden tremor of the whole body, a weight on the diaphragm, a &s;tu|por of all our organs, and a ten&s;ion of
<PB N="82" REF="85">the mu&s;cles of the face, palene&s;s covers the countenance and the eyes wander.</P>
<P>The&s;e effects are analogous to tho&s;e of fear, and are produced by the &s;ame cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Hence ugline&s;s renders us impotent; whil&s;t beauty, on the contrary, in&s;pires new vigour in the combats of love.</P>
<P>In the compound pa&s;&s;ions, the influence of the &s;oul on the body is the &s;ame as in the &s;imple. This may al&s;o be affirmed of its mechani&s;m. Hence the effect of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions is the &s;um of the particular effects of the different &s;entiments which unite and are confounded therein.</P>
<P>But the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t produce differ|ent effects, according to the relative force of the&s;e different &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Hence in terror, when fear predomi|nates, we experience all the effects of this pa&s;&s;ion, that numbne&s;s which de|prives us of the u&s;e of our &s;en&s;es, that languor which brings us back to the &s;tate of infancy, that &s;tupor which di&s;orders the action of our organs, and &s;ometimes prevails &s;o far as to de&s;troy it. When it is moderate, its impre&s;&s;ions on the body are very &s;light, nor can we di&s;tingui&s;h them from tho&s;e of the de&s;ire of &s;elf-pre|&s;ervation:
<PB N="83" REF="86">the &s;oul at that time impels the fluid of the nerves into the organs of mo|tion, as in joy, increa&s;es their vigour, and augments their ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>Hence that force which is produced by the &s;ight of danger, the la&s;t efforts of a &s;en&s;ible and intelligent being, who en|deavours to defend life, or a&s;&s;ure his own happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Rage produces likewi&s;e different effects on the body, according to the nature of the &s;entiment then reigning in the &s;oul.</P>
<P>In &s;entiments of hatred and &s;adne&s;s, which are the mo&s;t early in their effects on the body, the &s;oul forcibly impels the nervous fluid into the fibrillae of the mu&s;|cular fibres, extremely dilates their tube, contracts that of the fibres, and renders them &s;omewhat rigid. Hence the dia|meter of the ve&s;&s;els is dimini&s;hed, and the circulation &s;o imperfect, that the blood is not impelled to the arterial capillaries; hence the pallor of countenance and &s;tu|por of the limbs. The <HI>plexus nervo&s;i</HI> are likewi&s;e violently contracted, and parti|cularly the diaphragmatic nerve; hence that pre&s;&s;ure at the region of the heart, that weight which then &s;o grievou&s;ly af|fects
<PB N="84" REF="87">the &s;tomach, and nearly de&s;troys re&s;|piration.</P>
<P>But the&s;e effects are not of a long con|tinuance; to the &s;entiments of &s;adne&s;s and of hatred pre&s;ently &s;ucceeds a &s;trong de|&s;ire of revenge, which afterwards reigns &s;ingly in the &s;oul; the nervous fluid is then forcibly impelled into the mu&s;cu|lar fibres, whereby their diameter is greatly enlarged; this influx likewi&s;e compre&s;&s;es the fluid of the fibrillae, aug|ments their ela&s;ticity and envigorates the mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame principle, the nervous fluid produces in the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem an aptitude to the mo&s;t powerful o&s;cillation; the blood is thereby impelled to the extremities of the cutaneous capillaries, and into the or|gans of motion, which it renders &s;u&s;cep|tible of vigorous action: hence the im|petuous motions of rage, and the prodi|gious force of phrenetics. Such is the manner in which nature, who has e&s;ta|bli&s;hed between individuals different de|grees of power, &s;ometimes renders weak|ne&s;s equal to &s;trength by means of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>This influx of the fluid of the nerves into the fibres produces in the
<PB N="85" REF="88">plexus nervo&s;i, e&s;pecially in the ramifica|tions wound round the trunks of the veins, a &s;mall degree of rigidity; the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are thereby &s;omewhat ob&s;tructed, and the return of the blood to the heart is attended with difficulty, whil&s;t it is carried from the centre to the circumfe|rence with its u&s;ual freedom: the ve&s;&s;els are thereby greatly di&s;tended at the &s;ur|face of the body; whence &s;prings that redne&s;s of countenance, that fire of the eyes which ever accompany rage.</P>
<P>As this influx of the nervous fluid into the organs of motion is in&s;tantaneous, the&s;e organs are not affected with a de|gree of ten&s;ion equally violent or equally durable; the ea&s;e and perfection of their motion is thereby nece&s;&s;arily de&s;troyed: hence the tremor of the whole body, the hoar&s;e, loud and interrupted &s;peech, ever ob&s;erved in anger.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions, which are founded on ha|tred, add force to the natural &s;trength of Man; but this additional vigour is only momentary, and rage, as the other violent pa&s;&s;ion, having elevated Man for a few moments above him&s;elf, reduces him to an equal degree in the oppo&s;ite extreme.
<PB N="86" REF="89">On one part, weakening the fibres by vio|lent di&s;ten&s;ion and contraction, it dimi|ni&s;hes their primitive ela&s;ticity; on the other, exhau&s;ting by reiterated efforts that fluid which is the principle of vigour, it affects the body with extreme weakne&s;s, which de&s;troys both the power and the will to make any future effort.</P>
<P>I leave to the curious the examination of the effects of the &s;oul on the body in the other pa&s;&s;ions, the explanation is &s;im|ple and ea&s;y, by pur&s;uing the principles here e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions produce very &s;ingular ef|fects on the body, and di&s;play them&s;elves by &s;ome outward mark or other to the at|tentive ob&s;erver; but they are no where &s;o apparent as in the countenance. In the pa&s;&s;ions, the face is the living tablet where|on every emotion of the &s;oul is repre|&s;ented with equal energy and force.</P>
<P>By removing the teguments of the face, we ob&s;erve it to be compo&s;ed of a great number of &s;mall mu&s;cles, which adjoin to and unite every part by their tendons. The&s;e mu&s;cles form all the expre&s;&s;ions of phy&s;iognomy, and di&s;play every affection of the &s;oul. The repo&s;e of all the mu&s;|cles
<PB N="87" REF="90">expre&s;&s;es &s;erenity of mind, and their different motions, its different pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion, the &s;ame mu&s;cles are always contracted, and that in the &s;ame manner in every individual. When the &s;oul pa&s;&s;es rapidly from one &s;entiment to another, the features they form by their contraction are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively effaced; but when the &s;oul is habitually re&s;igned to any one pa&s;&s;ion, the features are con&s;tant, and become the characteri&s;tics of the phy&s;iog|nomy.</P>
<P>Every part of the face contributes to the beauty of the whole, but every part contributes not to its expre&s;&s;ion. Beauty con&s;i&s;ts in harmony and regularity of parts; phy&s;iognomy in their motion. The no&s;e, though the mo&s;t protuberant feature of the face, contributes the lea&s;t to phy&s;iog|nomy, it having very little motion. For the &s;ame rea&s;on the ears, the chin and the temples contribute le&s;s to phy&s;iognomy than to beauty. On the contrary, the lips, the mouth, the cheeks, the eye-lids and the eye brows, conduce much to ex|pre&s;&s;ion, by the different appearances they a&s;&s;ume. But no part is more expre&s;&s;ive than the eyes; in the&s;e admirable organs,
<PB N="88" REF="91">the &s;oul principally appears; in the&s;e it expre&s;&s;es the mo&s;t tumultuous emotions, and the mo&s;t agreeable &s;entiments; in the&s;e it expre&s;&s;es them in all their force, in all their purity, and di&s;plays, by the mo&s;t energetic lineaments, the image of its &s;ecret agitations. The cau&s;e of this phenomenon may, without difficulty, be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>As the eye is formed of many nerves, or rather, as it is only a large nerve ex|panded, and as it abounds with nervous fluid, to this organ therefore the impre&s;|&s;ions of the &s;oul mu&s;t be principally de|termined. It being likewi&s;e very conti|guous to the brain, and moreover dia|phanous, the power of the &s;oul mu&s;t be there le&s;s weak and more apparent: hence it is evident, that the pa&s;&s;ions will be re|pre&s;ented in this organ with the greate&s;t energy.</P>
<P>The power of the under&s;tanding over the body is exerci&s;ed by the &s;ame mecha|ni&s;m as that of &s;en&s;ibility; that is, ever by an impul&s;e communicated to the ner|vous fluid. By determining a greater quantity of this fluid to the nervous fi|bres, it produces a greater degree of ten|&s;ion;
<PB N="89" REF="92">thus it happens to all our mu&s;cles, to the <HI>plexus cardiaci,</HI> and e&s;pecially to the <HI>meninges</HI> during meditation. This increa&s;e of the organic ela&s;ticity of the fibres &s;trengthens the o&s;cillatory motion of the ve&s;&s;els, and renders the circulation more rapid. When meditation is deep in the extreme, this ten&s;ion of the fibres is ex|treme likewi&s;e, and the circulation be|comes vehement; the contraction of the nervous plexus enveloping the blood ve&s;|&s;els, at that time arre&s;ts the arterial and venous blood: whence ari&s;es that heat and tho&s;e anxieties, which ever accompany profound application.</P>
<P>By impelling a greater quantity of fluid into the nervous fibres, the &s;oul renders them more &s;en&s;ible, and prepares our or|gans to contract at the &s;lighte&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. Such is the method imagination u&s;es to &s;trengthen our &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>Hence ari&s;es that intolerable &s;en&s;ation which is produced by the touch of others, with a view to excite titillation. Hence is the cau&s;e of that ten&s;ion of the organs of plea&s;ure, which ari&s;es from the &s;ight or idea of la&s;civious objects, and of tho&s;e emi&s;&s;ions which are experienced when the
<PB N="90" REF="93">influx of the nervous fluid into the <HI>mu&s;|culi erectores penis,</HI> and the <HI>ve&s;iculoe &s;eminales</HI> is very rapid.</P>
<P>This fluid, when determined to the or|gans of dige&s;tion and &s;alival glands, by contracting them, excites the &s;ecretion of &s;aliva and ga&s;tric lymph. Such is the me|thod by which the imagination, from the &s;ight of delicate meats, occa&s;ions the &s;ame motion in the organ of dige&s;tion, as when they are &s;upplied with the aliments them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But if at any time the imagination im|pel this fluid into the mu&s;cular fibres, it at other times determines it to their fibrillae, produces there a degree of rigidity, which de&s;troys the action of the mu&s;cles and di&s;|orders the whole body.</P>
<P>Hence tho&s;e &s;hiverings, that imbecili|ty, which &s;ometimes render us unable to con&s;ummate the work of love.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions not only di&s;play them&s;elves in the countenance, not only dilate and contract the fibres; but the arms, the legs, the head, nay, the whole body, a&s;|&s;ume different po&s;tures, according to the different &s;entiments affecting us. By ex|citing the &s;ame &s;entiments, actors and mi|mics
<PB N="91" REF="94">communicate to us their port, their ge&s;ture, and their action.</P>
<P><HI>The influx of the nervous fluid into the fibres of the nerves and mu&s;cles or into their fibrilloe, a &s;mall degree of ten&s;ion, rigidity or relaxation of the&s;e fibres or of the&s;e fibrilloe, are therefore the true and &s;ole cau&s;es of all the phenomena of the influence of the &s;oul on the body.</HI></P>
<P>But for what rea&s;on does the &s;oul im|pel the nervous fluid into the mu&s;cular fi|bres, rather than into their fibrillae? Why into one organ or mu&s;cle rather than into another? Why in &s;hame does the head incline forwards, in &s;adne&s;s and in languor, on either &s;ide? Why in love do the organs of plea&s;ure experience &s;trong emotions exclu&s;ively of others? Why does imagination, excited by the ideas of exqui&s;ite meats, affect the organs of di|ge&s;tion rather than tho&s;e of love? By what means does the &s;oul, in the different pa&s;&s;i|ons, impel the nervous fluid into any par|ticular nerve, any particular mu&s;cle, or any particular organ exclu&s;ively; whil&s;t every part of the body partakes of nerves, which are common to all, who&s;e fibres are ever expo&s;ed to the influence of this
<PB N="92" REF="95">fluid which ince&s;&s;antly pervades them? The&s;e &s;ingular relations between particu|lar faculties of the &s;oul and certain organs of the body; this &s;urpri&s;ing corre&s;pon|dence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Another phenomenon equally &s;urpri&s;ing, which has not been more attended to than tho&s;e already men|tioned, is the faculty, which the &s;oul po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es unin|&s;tructed by experience, of di&s;cerning whence it receives its &s;en&s;ations.</NOTE>, which has been &s;o little attended to, is to me an enigma, an incomprehen|&s;ible my&s;tery, which I relinqui&s;h entirely to any one who is willing to undertake the &s;olution of it, if it can be accompli&s;hed by the human mind.</P>
<P>Let us here conclude with &s;ome impor|tant ob&s;ervations on the influence of the &s;oul on the body.</P>
<P>Every different emotion of the &s;oul af|fects the <HI>plexus nervo&s;i,</HI> which appear to be the principal organ wherein the pa&s;&s;i|ons exerci&s;e their power. There we feel that inexpre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h, which pity ex|cites in the heart, when we hear the groans of the unfortunate, or the cries of the op|pre&s;&s;ed; there fear and terror intrude their terrible anxieties; there joy introduces its
<PB N="93" REF="96">&s;weet tran&s;ports, and there the &s;oul leaves its mo&s;t durable impre&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The nervous fluid, impelled by the &s;oul, is preci|pitated in great quantity into their narrow and delicate tubes, di&s;tends them, and &s;ometimes ruptures their coats, which are too weak to &s;urmount its re&s;i&s;tance.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>All the pa&s;&s;ions domineer in the &s;oul; but the body, particularly the <HI>plexus ner|vo&s;i,</HI> is the wretched theatre of their conflict.</P>
<P>Sentiment is only a tran&s;ient emotion of the &s;oul, which endures only whil&s;t the under&s;tanding is fixed on the object by which it was produced; &s;entiment, when produced, is &s;ometimes &s;o early extingui&s;h|ed that it e&s;capes attention.</P>
<P>The &s;oul po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of fixing our &s;entiments at plea&s;ure, it &s;ometimes pre|&s;erves them in oppo&s;ition to the will. When a pa&s;&s;ion is agreeable to us, we en|tertain its object exclu&s;ively, and the &s;oul is delighted in its contemplation; let us then be ever &s;o willing to attend to other objects, plea&s;ure con&s;tantly attaches us to this only; the love of happine&s;s, ever pre|&s;ent to the mind, always determines it to that which admini&s;ters delight.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="97">Thus the unhappy lover, &s;eparated from his mi&s;tre&s;s, looks langui&s;hingly around him, and ince&s;&s;antly engro&s;&s;ed by the be|loved object, takes no intere&s;t in others: &s;weetly melancholy, he &s;eeks &s;ilence and &s;olitude, where, without interruption and free from importunate cares, he indulges his delightful revery, and re&s;igns him&s;elf wholly to the contemplation of the object he loves.</P>
<P>The will and the love of plea&s;ure, can fix any particular &s;entiment in the &s;oul; but when they fix none therein, when the mind choo&s;es to lo&s;e &s;ight of importunate objects, and begins to neglect them, it is the phy&s;ical cau&s;e which detains us with that upon which we are then engaged. It is the &s;en&s;e of the impre&s;&s;ion produced on our organs, and principally on the plexus nervo&s;i, which recalls us thereto. It is this which, amid&s;t &s;ports and entertain|ments, calls back the unfortunate to their grief and tears.</P>
<P>It is therefore only by aid of the im|pre&s;&s;ions produced on the&s;e <HI>plexus,</HI> that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tran&s;ient emotions of the &s;oul become permanent, that they acquire any duration in our hearts after their cau&s;es have cea&s;ed,
<PB N="95" REF="98">that they con&s;ume us, and continually prey on the mind, even in de&s;pite of our&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e by aid of the different impre&s;&s;ions of &s;entiments on the body, that contrary pa&s;&s;ions appear to be co-ex|i&s;tent in the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Let us however ob&s;erve, that as the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions are produced in contrary pa&s;|&s;ions by oppo&s;ite cau&s;es, they are common|ly de&s;troyed one by another; when, of the &s;eries of different &s;entiments to which the &s;oul is re&s;igned, the la&s;t becomes the mo&s;t powerful: but how &s;trong or how feeble &s;oever the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions may be, they mutually weaken each other. Hence we never ob&s;erve, at one time, on the phy|&s;iognomy, the violent tran&s;ports of joy, and the de&s;tructive languor of de&s;pair, al|though we frequently di&s;cover &s;adne&s;s veil|ed with a gentle &s;mile.</P>

<P>SEn&s;ibility, de&s;ires, pa&s;&s;ions, remem|brance, recollection, wit, talents of every kind, even the mo&s;t inferior qualities of the &s;oul, are different in every individual.
<PB N="96" REF="99">Are &s;ouls, then, in their nature, different? Are there as many &s;pecies of &s;ouls as there are of mo&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pope's E&s;&s;ay on Man.</NOTE>; or are they the &s;ame and unvaried in all men? This my&s;terious truth is equally unknown to the learned and un|learned. It is a &s;ecret impenetrable to Man, and known only to the great Author of Nature. But as we are able to account for the diver&s;ity of &s;ouls by the difference of bodies to which they are united, and by the different circum&s;tances of individuals, the po&s;&s;ibility, even the facility of a phy|&s;ical explanation of the diver&s;ity of cha|racters, pa&s;&s;ions, minds, induces us to believe, that &s;ouls are not e&s;&s;entially dif|ferent from each other. But were &s;ouls different in their nature, their diver&s;ity would be of no effect, &s;o long as they con|tinue united to the body: when once en|tered therein, they in&s;tantly become &s;ub|ject to phy&s;ical laws, and receive their character from organization<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Character is to the &s;oul what phy&s;iognomy is to the countenance; it is what di&s;tingui&s;hes one &s;oul from another.</NOTE>.

<P>Authors who have hitherto treated this &s;ubject, not con&s;idering the dignity of their undertaking, have, in&s;tead of inve&s;ti|gating the laws of the influence of the body on the &s;oul, employed their imagi|nation in the invention of new ones; in|&s;tead of labouring to di&s;cover the cau&s;es of phenomena by their effects, have con|founded the whole; by attributing to the body the properties of the &s;oul, they have made the faculties of the thinking &s;ub&s;tance &s;o many corporeal faculties, which they have di&s;tributed to particular organs, viz. <HI>the nervous fluid</HI> and <HI>the fibres of the brain:</HI> by the motion of the&s;e fibres, by the mo|dification of the&s;e organs and of this fluid, they have accounted for ideas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bonnet's Palingene&s;ie.

It is undoubtedly a compound of many extremely &s;mall ve&s;|&s;els, who&s;e direction is vi&s;ible, allotted for the &s;ecretion of the nervous fluid from the blood. This &s;uppo&s;ed marvellous &s;tructure of the brain can &s;erve no pur|po&s;e, if we re&s;tore to the &s;oul tho&s;e qualities which are without rea&s;on attributed to that organ.</NOTE>, a particular con&s;truction which it has not, an admirable &s;tructure &s;u|perior to all we can conceive or imagine, where the Deity can read as in a book the different thoughts of Man. Some have even &s;trained the marvellous, or rather the ridiculous &dagger;, to mea&s;ure the volume of the medullary &s;ub&s;tance, and to determine the number of ideas which a grain of the me|dulla contains. Having made the de&s;ires, pa&s;&s;ions, memory, imagination, &amp;c. mere|ly corporeal faculties; having given to each of the&s;e organic fibres a marvellous &s;tructure, they have tortured their minds to apply them to the different phenomena,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert Hook in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions.</NOTE>
<PB N="99" REF="102">but finding them&s;elves unable to make any ju&s;t application, they have made one which is ab&s;urd and unintelligible: by the&s;e forced and puerile explanations, by oc|cult cau&s;es not in the lea&s;t &s;atisfactory, they have involved in darkne&s;s that which they de&s;ired to explain, rendering them&s;elves ridiculous in the opinion of men of ge|nius, and unintelligible to inferior capa|cities.</P>
<P>Every one hitherto has fallen into the&s;e errors, and, as if it were impo&s;&s;ible to arrive at truth, has neglected that which alone could conduct him thither.

<P>Thus, ignorant of every true princi|ple, they undertook to explain the&s;e phe|nomena, but not being able to complete their de&s;ign, abandoned it, imputing their inability to the intricate nature of the &s;ubject.

<P>EVERY mind is endued with the &s;ame faculties; in this re&s;pect, all are &s;imilar: but the&s;e faculties are more or le&s;s exten|&s;ive, more or le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of improve|ment, and &s;ome have their peculiar propen|&s;ities; but in the&s;e, all minds vary.

<HEAD>The Sen&s;ibility of the <HI>SOUL</HI> ever Propor|tionate to that of the <HI>ORGANS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>There is a con&s;tant relation between the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;oul and that of the body, a determinate invariable relation.</P>
<P>Is the body endued with great &s;en&s;ibili|ty? The &s;oul is &s;o likewi&s;e: does it po&s;|&s;e&s;s but little of it? The &s;oul ever po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es it in the &s;ame degree.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this phenomenon is very &s;imple.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="104">However &s;en&s;ible the &s;oul may be in it|&s;elf, the mea&s;ure of that &s;en&s;ibility is un|di&s;coverable by us, and is, in fact, wholly obliterated, even &s;uppo&s;ing the mind to have been pre-exi&s;tent to the body, and that all its faculties were active before its union with matter: for the &s;oul being once united to corporeal organs, there re|mains not the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of its former &s;tate, every thing is forgotten. When united<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book II. Art. of the unfolding of the facul|ties of the &s;oul.</NOTE>, the &s;oul receives no &s;en&s;ations but by the body; like a &s;heet of white paper, whereon objects are repre&s;ented after hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed through different intervening mediums, the &s;oul receives its &s;en&s;ations by the organs of &s;en&s;e; its &s;en&s;ations there|fore are founded on impre&s;&s;ions made on the body. But as the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;oul is a purely pa&s;&s;ive faculty, the different degrees of which are not known to us by any immediate method, and as the &s;en&s;a|tions of the &s;oul are all founded on tho&s;e of the body; the vivacity of the &s;en&s;ations of the &s;oul therefore depends on that of the &s;en&s;ations of the body. The &s;en&s;ibi|lity of the&s;e two &s;ub&s;tances mu&s;t be equal.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="105">Thus the degree of the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;oul depends on purely phy&s;ical cau&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book I. Art. the organs of &s;en&s;e con&s;idered with regard to their different degrees of &s;en&s;ibility.</NOTE>.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Why the Sen&s;ibility of the <HI>SOUL</HI> appears more powerful than the Sen&s;ibility of the <HI>BODY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;oul is ever pro|portionate to that of the body, and the &s;en&s;ations are ever more &s;trong at the in|&s;tant they are received from the object, than when remitted from the memory<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Book II. Art. on the exerci&s;e of the memory.</NOTE>. Hence it appears, that the mo&s;t powerful artificial plea&s;ures, the mo&s;t lively paint|ings of the imagination, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be weaker than the impre&s;&s;ions of the &s;en&s;es. However, when we compare the repre&s;entations of fancy with tho&s;e of na|ture, the brilliant paintings of love in the <HI>Adonis</HI> of <HI>Marini,</HI> with the merely phy&s;i|cal plea&s;ures of that pa&s;&s;ion, we are much more &s;trongly affected by the former than by the latter.</P>
<P>Whence ari&s;es this phenomenon? It is not that the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;oul is more &s;trong than that of our organs, as might be inferred from the&s;e examples; but that
<PB N="103" REF="106">the &s;en&s;es, in their enjoyment, being ever confined to their objects, can neither add to, nor take from them; whil&s;t the ima|gination being free in the choice of its colours and its lineaments, ince&s;&s;antly pa&s;&s;es from object to object, &s;electing that which is mo&s;t brilliant, and mo&s;t en|gaging, and from thence forms its images, as the bee its honey from the mo&s;t delicious parts of flowers. The lineaments which are di&s;per&s;ed in &s;en&s;ual enjoyments, are col|lected, or rather concentrated in our ima|ginary plea&s;ures, and acquire force from this concentration, as the rays of light collected in the focus of a mirror.</P>
<P>The paintings of imagination mu&s;t therefore appear more powerful than the plea&s;ures of the &s;en&s;es; although they re|ceive their whole force from the &s;en&s;ations of the body.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Why <HI>MAN</HI> is more &s;en&s;ible to Pain than Plea&s;ure.</HEAD>
<P>Painful &s;en&s;ations affect us incompara|bly more &s;trongly than the agreeable; for violent pain de&s;troys all &s;en&s;ations of plea|&s;ure, but the mo&s;t powerful &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure cannot &s;ilence a &s;trong &s;en&s;ation of pain.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="107">However &s;urpri&s;ing this phenomenon may appear, it is not difficult to a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding we are ignorant of the mechani&s;m of the &s;en&s;ations, it is however certain, that their force is ever propor|tionate to the affection of the nervous fi|bres of which their organs are formed. In the agreeable &s;en&s;ations, the&s;e fibres are &s;lightly affected; it may be &s;aid, that objects of plea&s;ure pa&s;s only gently over them; whil&s;t, in painful &s;en&s;ations, the &s;ame fibres are violently compre&s;&s;ed, are ever rendered extremely ten&s;e and often broken.</P>
<P>Hence Man is le&s;s &s;en&s;ible to plea&s;ure than pain; hence more &s;trongly affected by the repre&s;entation of Tartarus than by that of Ely&s;ium; hence the attraction of plea&s;ure, the plea&s;ingne&s;s of hope, always yield to the fear of torment and to the hor|ror of de&s;pair.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Why the Character of the <HI>SOUL</HI> is ever con|gruous to the State of the <HI>BODY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>There is a con&s;tant relation between the di&s;po&s;ition or humour of Man, and the con&s;titution of the corporeal organs.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="108">Is the body affected with di&s;ea&s;e? The &s;oul is &s;ad Is the body in health? The &s;oul is gay. Is the former in vigour? The latter is vivacious. Is that Ianguid? This is &s;o too.</P>
<P>Sadne&s;s, gaiety, vivacity, languor, the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, the&s;e &s;entiments, are experi|enced by the &s;oul often when it is ignorant of their &s;ubject, ignorant even of their &s;ource. Like two harmonic machines, the &s;oul con&s;tantly corre&s;ponds to the &s;tate of the body; the &s;ame phenomenon is ob|&s;erved at all times and in all places: the light does not more regularly follow the revolutions of the &s;un, than the &s;oul the revolutions of the body.</P>
<P>Let us explain this phenomenon.</P>
<P>Although the &s;en&s;ations be not the cau&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ions, and although no mecha|ni&s;m whatever can produce in the heart a &s;entiment of &s;adne&s;s or of joy, it is ne|verthele&s;s a law of nature, that when &s;ome particular &s;en&s;ation is received, &s;ome particular &s;entiment &s;hould ari&s;e in the &s;oul; that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book II. Art. origin of our &s;entiments.</NOTE> plea&s;ure &s;hould excite joy, and pain &s;adne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="109">Plea&s;ure and pain &s;pring from three different &s;ources,</P>
<P>From external objects, by the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>From ideas, by thought.</P>
<P>From the internal parts of the body, by the general organs of feeling.</P>
<P>The agreeable and painful &s;en&s;ations which ari&s;e from the two fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;ources, are momentary; becau&s;e the &s;en&s;es are not always affected, nor is the under|&s;tanding con&s;tantly in exerci&s;e: but the &s;oul con&s;tantly receives &s;en&s;ations from the third &s;ource, if it be only that of the &s;tate of the body.</P>
<P>Joy and &s;adne&s;s, &s;entiments which have an immediate relation to agreeable and painful &s;en&s;ations, mu&s;t therefore prevail in the &s;oul in proportion as the one or the other of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations re&s;ults from the di&s;po|&s;ition of our organs.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ions of plea&s;ure and pain, which we receive from the two fir&s;t &s;ources, are the cau&s;e of tho&s;e tran&s;ient fits of ex|ultation and &s;adne&s;s, which we &s;o fre|quently experience, who&s;e &s;ubject is ever known; tho&s;e, we receive from the la&s;t, are the cau&s;e of that gaiety and &s;adne&s;s with which we are at all times more or le&s;s
<PB N="107" REF="110">affected, frequently imperceptibly to our|&s;elves, but much oftener without our knowing their principle: the&s;e form the ba&s;is of the humour of Man.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the body is in health, whil&s;t all the functions are perfectly performed, and the fluids circulate with freedom and ea&s;e, this motion of the fluids produces on the <HI>plexus nervo&s;i,</HI> which envelope the ve&s;&s;els, an agreeable &s;en&s;ation, a &s;light and vague emotion, more ea&s;ily &s;elt than de&s;cribed: this &s;en&s;ation pa&s;&s;es into the &s;oul by the nerves: hence joy, which &s;prings from plea&s;ure and ince&s;&s;antly accompanies it, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;ary ari&s;e therein together with this agreeable &s;en&s;ation. Thus gaiety and good humour are nece&s;&s;ary attendants on health.</P>
<P>On the contrary, are the functions of the animal machine di&s;ordered? Are our fluids too den&s;e, too acrid, in too large or too &s;mall a quantity? Is their circulation violent or difficult? The di&s;order within, produces in the &s;oul a di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;a|tion, ever accompanied with &s;adne&s;s.</P>
<P>When all the functions of the animal machine are ea&s;ily performed, Man is gay;
<PB N="108" REF="111">when with difficulty, he is melancholy and &s;ad.</P>
<P>When an ea&s;y or irregular performance of the functions is the natural &s;tate of the body, we are gay or &s;ad by con&s;titution. But as ea&s;y circulation re&s;ults from the equilibrium between our fluids and &s;olids; as this equilibrium may be ea&s;ily de&s;troy|ed in a machine &s;o complex and &s;o feeble as the human body, ince&s;&s;antly expo&s;ed to &s;hocks from external objects, from the impul&s;e of fluids penetrating it in every part, often &s;o pernicious in their nature, and almo&s;t always with &s;o little proportion to its delicacy, it may be ea&s;ily conceived, that the &s;tate which produces gaiety, mu&s;t &s;eldom exi&s;t; but that which produces &s;adne&s;s, very often.</P>
<P>That voluptuous &s;en&s;ation, which ari&s;es from the ea&s;y motion of the organs, is likewi&s;e much more re&s;trained than the di&s;agreeable en&s;ation which &s;prings from a defect in their harmony. The former va|ries very little, becau&s;e one cau&s;e only pro|duces it; the latter, on the contrary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When this equilibrium is de&s;troyed and the fluids prevail, the blood circulates with difficulty; we then feel a kind of &s;tupor and indeterminate pain, like that which men of plea&s;ure experience when exhau&s;ted by enjoyment When it is de&s;troyed, and the &s;olids pre|vail, it forms that &s;en&s;e of agitation we call inquietude; add to this every kind of pain accompanying the di&s;|ca&s;es and infirmities attached to nature.</NOTE>, is
<PB N="109" REF="112">of different kinds, and each kind is dif|ferently diver&s;ified. Thus the gay cha|racter is ever uniform, whil&s;t the melan|choly humour has as many gradations, as are found between the &s;lighte&s;t and deep|e&s;t melancholy.</P>
<P>Although the voluptuous &s;en&s;ation, pro|duced by the perfect &s;tate of the functions of the body, be &s;ingle in its kind, it has however its gradations. As this equili|brium between the &s;olids and fluids is more or le&s;s perfect, the agreeable &s;en&s;a|tion which re&s;ults from it is more or le&s;s powerful, and the gaiety of temper more or le&s;s apparent.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ations therefore of plea&s;ure or pain have their different degrees; but the&s;e degrees approximate in&s;en&s;ibly; there is a point where the&s;e &s;en&s;ations are &s;o greatly weakened, that they are no lon|ger di&s;tinct, but become confounded one with the other. This point depends on
<PB N="110" REF="113">that di&s;po&s;ition of the body, which con|&s;titutes uniformity, or rather &s;erenity of temper; an indeci&s;ive character, and &s;o much the more indeci&s;ive, as the&s;e &s;en&s;a|tions are the more confounded.</P>
<P>Finally, as the mechani&s;m of the body, to which the&s;e &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure or of pain, which are the &s;ource of a me|lancholy temper, are to be imputed, is changeable, &s;o the temper varies likewi&s;e. Ob&s;erve however that the agreeable &s;en&s;a|tion, which depends on the perfect &s;tate of the machine, can be ea&s;ily de&s;troyed; whil&s;t the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, which re&s;ults from the primitive con&s;titution of the &s;olids, is in the other extreme. Thus it is not unfrequent that gaiety yields to &s;adne&s;s, but a melancholy temper &s;eldom gives way to mirth.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have di&s;cour&s;ed of the temper only; let us examine that vivacity and that languor of the &s;oul, which ever accompany the vigor or languor of the body, one of which wears &s;o &s;trong an appearance of gaiety, and the other of &s;adne&s;s.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t con&s;ider the languor of the &s;oul, le&s;s as a weak degree of &s;adne&s;s, al|though
<PB N="111" REF="114">it has all the appearance of it, than as a &s;tate of indetermination, where|in Man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not &s;ufficient power to determine him&s;elf. Objects ever remain the &s;ame; they likewi&s;e act on our &s;en&s;es by the &s;ame mechani&s;m: but whil&s;t the body is affected with a languor, their im|pre&s;&s;ion on our organs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book I. Art. the organs of &s;en&s;e con&s;idered with regard to their different degrees of &s;en&s;ibility.</NOTE> is much weaken|ed by the deficiency of the organic ela&s;ticity of the fibres. Thus weakened, the &s;en|&s;ations communicate an impre&s;&s;ion, too feeble<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I &s;hall hereafter demon&s;trate, that the &s;en&s;ations and &s;entiments, when re-produced, are not more powerful.</NOTE> to excite any &s;trong emotion in the &s;oul.</P>
<P>There is a &s;urpri&s;ing relation in Man, as in every other animal, between &s;en&s;a|tion, &s;entiment and action. External ob|jects act upon the &s;en&s;es, the &s;en&s;es mo|dify their impre&s;&s;ion, convey it to the &s;oul, and the &s;oul con&s;equently re-acts on the body. Thus in the animal oeconomy, the action of external objects on the &s;en&s;es is ever &s;ucceeded by the re-action of the &s;oul on our organs. The one is the cau&s;e, the other the effect; this cau&s;e and this
<PB N="112" REF="115">effect are ever proportionate. The ge&s;|ture of the body, the tone of the voice, the rapidity of the &s;peech, and every mecha|nical motion, by which the &s;oul externally di&s;plays its emotions, have nece&s;&s;arily a force proportionate to the vivacity of the&s;e emotions.</P>
<P>In voluntary motion the &s;ame relation is ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Man cannot &s;ee his own good without making &s;ome efforts to obtain it, nor be expo&s;ed to any evil without attempting to avoid it, and that ever with an ardor proportionate to the greatne&s;s of the good he &s;eeks, and of the evil he would avoid. Thus when the vigor of the body decays, the &s;entiments are de&s;titute of vivacity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t cau&s;e of the languor and vi|vacity of the &s;oul is in the organs, which receive the impre&s;&s;ion of external objects; the &s;econd in the &s;oul, which experiences this impre&s;&s;ion, and re-acts upon the or|gans. In the former ca&s;e, the&s;e impre&s;&s;i|ons on the body have but little effect on the &s;oul; in the latter, the emotions of the &s;oul have but little effect on the body.</P>
<P>The force of the &s;en&s;ations of the body, and of the emotions of the &s;oul, is ever
<PB N="113" REF="116">ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the vivacity of the temper and character; but the&s;e cau&s;es alone are not &s;ufficient; for the &s;oul and the body are without any immediate com|munication. Thus, however powerful the &s;en&s;ations of the body, and the emo|tions of the &s;oul may be, they are inef|fectual, when not propagated reciprocally from one of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances to the other. The nervous fluid being the medium of communication between the&s;e two &s;ub|&s;tances, it follows, that the impul&s;es, tran&s;mitted by either, are very much mo|dified by the action of this fluid; and their force is ever in proportion to the vi|vacity of this action.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the body is languid, this action is feeble; for the &s;ame cau&s;es which pro|duce the vivacity of the impre&s;&s;ions of objects, continue it whil&s;t it is propagated; and the &s;ame cau&s;es, which are nece&s;|&s;ary to tran&s;mit to the &s;oul the vivacity of the &s;en&s;ations of the body, are &s;o like|wi&s;e, to tran&s;mit to the body the vivacity of the emotions of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Hence <HI>Macrocephali</HI> are more viva|cious than others, and <HI>Microcephali</HI> le&s;s &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="117">Hence, likewi&s;e, extreme fatigue &s;eems to extingui&s;h in our hearts all &s;entiments and de&s;ires.

<P>The &s;oul, united to gro&s;s organs, loves lively amu&s;ements and noi&s;y plea&s;ures; to delicate organs, refined plea&s;ures and peace|able amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>Brilliant colours are plea&s;ing to robu&s;t per&s;ons; &s;uch are pa&s;&s;ionately fond of warlike mu&s;ic, penetrating odours and &s;pirituous liquors. Per&s;ons of delicate texture and great &s;en&s;ibility, on the con|trary,

<P>The cau&s;e of this phenomenon is, on one hand, the relation ob&s;erved between the &s;en&s;ibility of our organs and the force of the impre&s;&s;ion of objects; on the other, the organic di&s;po&s;ition which characteri&s;es the temper.</P>
<P>With the impre&s;&s;ions we receive from objects, con&s;tantly concur two analogous &s;entiments of the &s;oul; love, with a|greeable &s;en&s;ations; and hatred, with painful.</P>
<P>All men &s;eek plea&s;ure and fly from pain; in this they all accord: but we never &s;eek objects but from the relation which they have to our&s;elves, that is, from
<PB N="126" REF="129">the degree of plea&s;ure they can commu|nicate.</P>
<P>The &s;entiments of love and hatred mu&s;t therefore change with the&s;e rela|tions.</P>
<P>A weak &s;ight, or rather an eye ex|tremely &s;en&s;ible, delights not in glar|ing colours; &s;uch being prejudicial to it. A delicate ear, delights not in vio|lent noi&s;es for the &s;ame rea&s;on: what|ever is injurious to the &s;en&s;es, is plea&s;ing to no one. On the other part, every be|ing loves to be &s;en&s;ible of its own exi&s;t|ence. Thus, whenever any one avoids too violent &s;en&s;ations, he &s;eeks tho&s;e on|ly which have a certain degree of vi|vacity.</P>
<P>Hence the &s;oul, which is united to gro&s;s organs, being too weakly affected by gen|tle and delicate &s;en&s;ations, loves tho&s;e which are violent and &s;trong; &s;uch as &s;pirituous liquors, glaring colours, the &s;ound of the horn, trumpet, drums, and all kinds of noi&s;y amu&s;ements: whil&s;t the &s;oul, which is united to a delicate and &s;en&s;ible con&s;ti|tution,

<P>But in the&s;e relations between the affec|tions of the &s;oul and organization, there is a more than &s;imple proportion between the force of the impre&s;&s;ion of objects and the delicacy of the &s;en&s;es; for many mode|rate plea&s;ures are devoid of tenderne&s;s, and a great number of amu&s;ements which can|not be cla&s;&s;ed with the noi&s;y, excite no gentle emotion.</P>
<P>What then determines the &s;oul, which is united to delicate organs, to tenderne&s;s? It is the con&s;titution of the body, but con|&s;idered in another point of view.</P>
<P>I have demon&s;trated, that the &s;tate of the body, which renders the temper gay, likewi&s;e renders Man a lover of di&s;&s;ipa|tion; whil&s;t that, which renders it me|lancholy, renders him pen&s;ive.

The gentle lan|guor we then experience, and which is a di&s;po&s;ition to tenderne&s;s, conveys to the &s;oul an agreeable &s;en&s;ation with which we de&s;ire to be affected, and which we che|ri&s;h in the heart. Hence we delight in every thing which tends to pre&s;erve it; as, affecting mu&s;ic, amorous di&s;cour&s;es, and every plea&s;ure productive of tenderne&s;s and love.</P>
<P>But the affections of the &s;oul are deter|mined by the organization in a manner yet more particular.</P>
<P>The prevailing pa&s;&s;ion, in tho&s;e affec|tions of the &s;oul which have a phy&s;ical ob|ject, is ever fixed by that &s;en&s;e which is
<PB N="127" REF="134">the be&s;t con&s;tituted, and by the mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible organ. He who&s;e organs of plea&s;ure po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;en&s;ibility &s;uperior to that of his other &s;en&s;es, is libertine and la&s;civious. He who&s;e palate, or rather who&s;e tongue, is the mo&s;t delicate of his organs, is a drunkard or a glutton. He who&s;e hear|ing is exqui&s;ite, is pa&s;&s;ionately fond of mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that the reigning pa&s;&s;ion is ever determined by that organ which is the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible: this is evident, &s;ince Man &s;eeks plea&s;ure with an ardour propor|tionate to its vivacity. But if, of the&s;e enjoyments which he attains, one part ex|clude another, he ever prefers that which is the mo&s;t engaging. The more &s;en&s;ible the organs, the greater the plea&s;ure; for we can at all times proportion objects to the &s;en&s;es when too delicate; but we can never proportion the organ to objects when it is deficient in &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The gay love joy and &s;eek comic or mirthful amu&s;ements; the &s;ad, on the contrary, delight only in tho&s;e which are
<PB N="128" REF="135">&s;ad and mournful; they delight to re|late and hear related tragic adventures, &s;hun gay company, fly to de&s;erts, woods, caves, gloomy fore&s;ts, and &s;avage na|ture.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to conceive why the gay de|light in joy, this being of it&s;elf agreea|ble; but by what caprice do the &s;ad de|light in &s;adne&s;s, in tragic and mournful amu&s;ements? If we attentively con&s;ider it, we &s;hall find the cau&s;e of this &s;urpri&s;|ing phenomenon in the di&s;po&s;ition which the &s;oul receives from the body, combin|ed with &s;elf-love. I have &s;aid, that we &s;eek after tho&s;e things only which have &s;ome relation to our&s;elves; this is true in more than one re&s;pect. The &s;ad by con&s;titution, being ince&s;&s;antly affected by a di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, vexed that he is only con&s;cious of his exi&s;tence by his &s;ufferings, envious and jealous of what he does not po&s;&s;e&s;s, and what if he were po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of, he could not enjoy, hates tho&s;e who are le&s;s unhappy than him&s;elf; and by a natural con&s;equence, &s;huns all &s;o|ciety
<PB N="129" REF="136">where there is the lea&s;t appearance of gaiety. The idea that him&s;elf is not the only mi&s;erable being, alleviates his torments; the thought that others partici|pate his &s;ufferings gives him ea&s;e; thus he recounts tragic adventures, and is plea&s;ed at the &s;ight of another's misfortunes. As the only plea&s;ure he can enjoy is that of afflicting the happy, and as the only mean he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es of relieving his own mi&s;ery, is the indulging him&s;elf in reflecting on the &s;ufferings of others, he flies to &s;olitude, to &s;avage and de&s;ert nature, where he may, without interruption, indulge the gloomy reflections of his &s;oul. Thus the phy&s;ical &s;ways the moral part in Man, and the con&s;titution of the body generates the af|fections of the mind.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now prove, that the force and duration of the&s;e affections depend whol|ly on mechanical cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The relations, which are ob&s;erved be|tween the &s;en&s;ibility of the body and that of the &s;oul, are likewi&s;e ob&s;erved between the &s;tate of our organs and the character of our &s;entiments.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="137">The force, the vivacity, the duration, the violence of the &s;entiments of the &s;oul, are all of them effects of organization.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ations are undoubtedly not the cau&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ions; but &s;en&s;ibility is the mea&s;ure of their force; for the de&s;ire of being happy, which blindly leads us in que&s;t of plea&s;ure, and prompts us to fly from pain, ever carries us thither with an ardour proportioned to the greatne&s;s of the good we pur&s;ue, or of the evils we avoid.</P>
<P>As the degree of the good and of the evil is ever determined by that of &s;en&s;ibi|lity, the pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t draw their force from the organization; the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;oul being ever determined by that of the body.</P>
<P>There is a &s;urpri&s;ing relation in Man between &s;entiment and action. He cannot perceive his good without making &s;ome effort to acquire it, nor be expo&s;ed to evil, without attempting to avoid it. This I have already ob&s;erved, but there is a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of repeating it here. If it be evi|dent, as undoubtedly it is, that Man ever
<PB N="131" REF="138">yields to &s;entiment, and that the degree of the good and the evil is determined in every individual by that of &s;en&s;ibility, it is plain, that the more &s;en&s;ible Man is, the greater efforts he will make to enjoy that good, or avoid that evil.</P>
<P>But this relation between &s;entiment and action is not re&s;trained to voluntary mo|tion; the action of external objects on the &s;oul is ever followed by the re-action of the &s;oul on the body. Unable to re&s;train the emotions agitating it within, the &s;oul di&s;plays them externally by impre&s;&s;ions purely mechanical, and ever with a force proportioned to that of its &s;entiments. Thus in the violent pa&s;&s;ions, we are ever tran&s;ported with &s;trong and precipitate motions; but when all is placid and quiet within, all is calm and &s;erene without.</P>
<P>Yet the man, who is ardent in his de|&s;ires, is not ever impetuous in his actions. Vivacity of motion &s;uppo&s;es only great organic ela&s;ticity of the fibres: impetuo|&s;ity requires not only great organic ela&s;|ticity of the fibres, but force and &s;olidity of the organs likewi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="139">The duration of a pa&s;&s;ion is determin|ed by its objects. The &s;en&s;ual are ever momentaneous: tho&s;e, which have &s;ome natural want for their cau&s;e, continue not after this want is &s;upplied; the others are not more durable. But tho&s;e, which are produced by the imagination, are incom|parably more con&s;tant; they reign through|out the day, and di&s;appear not at night; they attend us when we retire to re&s;t, and reign in the mind when all the &s;en&s;es are locked in &s;leep. This duration of the artificial pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o long when compared to that of the &s;en&s;ual, depends on the or|ganization combined with the nature of their different objects.</P>
<P>It is the property of our plea&s;ures mu|tually to de&s;troy each other, on enjoyment, and to have no continuance without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of novelty.

Thus in &s;en&s;ual love, the &s;weet emotions of the &s;oul, and the &s;pirits, are lo&s;t together: but in the artificial pa&s;&s;ions, the heated imagina|tion exaggerates objects, adorns and em|belli&s;hes them; the &s;oul, &s;eized with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardor, affects the body with &s;trong emotions, and thereby retains its tender &s;entiments, even when plea&s;ure is extinct.</P>
<P>Nature cannot long &s;upport the violence of an extremely active pa&s;&s;ion; the &s;entiments forming this pa&s;&s;ion vani&s;h, and in&s;tantly re-appear. The cau&s;e of this phenome|non is phy&s;ical. In every pa&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t the &s;oul is fixed on its objects, the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ob&s;ervation 6, Book III.</NOTE> or|gans are ten&s;e; this is ob&s;erved even du|ring &s;leep, when the commerce of the &s;oul with the body appears to be interrup|ted. In the agitation of a trouble&s;ome
<PB N="134" REF="141">dream, the pul&s;e becomes quicker, the complexion more lively, the body is va|riou&s;ly agitated, Man awakes and finds him&s;elf in his bed, exhau&s;ted by fatigue, and wet with &s;weat and with his tears. In the pa&s;&s;ions, ten&s;ion of the body ever ac|companies ten&s;ion of the &s;oul. This ten|&s;ion of the &s;entient &s;ub&s;tance is not only determined by that of the organs of the body, but wholly depends on it; for when the body is affected with languor, the &s;oul receives no &s;trong &s;en&s;ation, it is in&s;u&s;ceptible of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a preceding Article. Why the character of the &s;oul is ever congruous to the &s;tate of the body. Book IV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Let us then conclude, that if the &s;oul cannot long &s;u&s;tain very &s;trong emotions, it is becau&s;e the fibres of the body cannot endure great ten&s;ion for any length of time.</P>
<P>The violent pa&s;&s;ions con&s;i&s;t in a &s;e|ries of &s;entiments, which are interrupted, one in&s;tant, and renewed the next; the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e &s;entiments is perceived only at intervals.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="142">The duration of each particular &s;enti|ment, and that of their total &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, depend on the organization. For if the &s;oul always requires the mediation of the body, to receive any &s;trong &s;en&s;ation; if it be unable to fix it&s;elf without the con|currence of the other; it plainly appears, that the duration of every &s;trong emotion of the mind, and that of all the&s;e emo|tions which are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively experienced, depends on that faculty of the body, whereby it continues ten&s;e a longer or &s;horter time; a faculty dependent on the different degrees of organic ela&s;ticity and &s;olidity of the fibres.</P>
<P>Thus the &s;oul, which is united to &s;trong and ela&s;tic organs, is &s;ubject to violent and durable pa&s;&s;ions; that which is united to delicate organs, unable to endure long continued ten&s;ion, pa&s;&s;es ince&s;&s;antly from one impre&s;&s;ion to another; and never ex|periences any which is la&s;ting.</P>
<P>In the violent pa&s;&s;ions, the &s;oul is truly pa&s;&s;ionate, only when engaged with its objects; when it cea&s;es to be affected thereby, the pa&s;&s;ion expires; yet the &s;ame
<PB N="136" REF="143">internal di&s;po&s;ition continues, even when the &s;oul is engaged with a new &s;entiment. The cau&s;e of this phenomenon has been already &s;hewn to be in that impre&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the conclu&s;ion of the 1&s;t Section, Book IV.</NOTE>, which &s;en&s;ibility produces on the body, and which in its turn, from an effect be|comes a cau&s;e, pre&s;erving in the &s;oul the &s;entiment which produced it, and recalling it there, if at any time its object di&s;|appear.</P>
<P>But this impre&s;&s;ion which the pa&s;&s;ions produce on our organs is not equally dura|ble in every individual. The more &s;trong the&s;e emotions are, &s;o much the more ap|parent is this effect; for the more &s;trong is the impul&s;e communicated to the ner|vous fluid by the &s;oul, and the more ex|treme the ten&s;ion of the fibres, &s;o much the more is their ela&s;ticity weakened, the equilibrium between the&s;e two powers of the circulation de&s;troyed, and the circu|lation it&s;elf ob&s;tructed. At this time the nervous fluid produces, e&s;pecially in the plexus nervo&s;i, a very great con&s;triction,
<PB N="137" REF="144">proper to continue the emotions of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>The duration of this impre&s;&s;ion is at fir&s;t, therfore, in a direct ratio of the de|gree of &s;en&s;ibility, afterwards in an inver&s;e; for the more ela&s;tic the fibres are, &s;o much the more they yield to the action of the nervous fluid, the more forcible like|wi&s;e is their re-action, and the equilibrium much &s;ooner re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. In e&s;timating the&s;e relations, we find the duration of this impre&s;&s;ion to gain le&s;s by an exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility in the organs, than it is preju|diced by an exce&s;s of organic ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>In a body delicate and vigorous, the &s;oul mu&s;t therefore be &s;ubject to pa&s;&s;ions the mo&s;t violent and the lea&s;t durable; in a body indelicate and robu&s;t, to tho&s;e which are the mo&s;t con&s;tant.</P>
<P>Hence the rea&s;on why men of great &s;en|&s;ibility are ea&s;ily provoked to anger, whil&s;t the indelicate and robu&s;t are with diffi|culty inflamed. Hence the rea&s;on why the anger of the former is like a fire of &s;tubble, which blazes and is &s;oon extin|gui&s;hed; while that of the others is of
<PB N="138" REF="145">long continuance: once excited to fury, their &s;ouls cannot be appea&s;ed, re&s;entment remains after revenge is gone, like the agitated ocean, which &s;ub&s;ides not to a calm till a con&s;iderable &s;pace after the &s;torm. But the duration of the pa&s;&s;ions is produced by many other cau&s;es. Whil&s;t Man is intent upon the object of his pa&s;|&s;ion, as he is ever &s;urrounded with beings adapted to di&s;tract him, he ea&s;ily lo&s;es &s;ight of it: this very frequently happens. During the&s;e moments of di&s;traction, if the &s;en&s;ation which occa&s;ioned it be not very intere&s;ting, the pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be re|garded as a latent fire, which in&s;tantly blazes forth on the lea&s;t admi&s;&s;ion of air.</P>
<P>If the &s;oul be &s;trongly affected by the&s;e new objects, the pa&s;&s;ion revives not, but yields to &s;ome other &s;entiment. Thus the more &s;en&s;ible a man is, the more he is expo&s;ed to the impre&s;&s;ion of external ob|jects, and the more ea&s;ily will his pa&s;&s;ions be extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>This is the cau&s;e why the virtue of the &s;prightly is neither regular nor con&s;tant;
<PB N="139" REF="146">it appears only at intervals, by &s;tarts, as if it had no &s;ource in the per&s;ons them|&s;elves; they being obliged to be frequently recalled to the practice of it: while the virtue of the &s;edate and robu&s;t has the ap|pearance of con&s;tant habit.</P>
<P>On the other hand, while the pa&s;&s;ion is extremely violent, and any &s;entiment ty|rannizes in the &s;oul, other objects have not power to di&s;engage the attention.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions therefore, if they are, on one &s;ide, le&s;s con&s;tant in proportion as Man is more &s;en&s;ible; they are, on the other, more con&s;tant in proportion as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es greater &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>This is ob&s;erved more e&s;pecially in the pa&s;&s;ions which have a &s;entiment of love for their ba&s;is: when the &s;oul believes that its own happine&s;s depends on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome object, nothing can di&s;engage it from thence; the powerful attractives of plea&s;ure keep it intent on the be|loved object, and admits of no inter|ruption.</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations let us conclude, that,</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="147">A Man of extreme &s;en&s;ibility, who has only &s;light affections, mu&s;t be the mo&s;t fickle of human kind; he is never &s;o con|&s;tant, as when violently excited by &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>The force of the pa&s;&s;ions therefore depends on the &s;en&s;ibility of the fibres; their violence on their extreme &s;en&s;ibility, and their impe|tuou&s;ity on their &s;en&s;ibility combined with their force: the duration of the pa&s;&s;ions depends equally on the &s;en&s;ibility and ela&s;ticity of the fibres, and on their force and &s;olidity.</HI> It is thus the phy&s;ical part in Man gives cha|racter to our &s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>How Organization renders <HI>MAN</HI> open-hearted, or a Di&s;&s;embler.</HEAD>
<P>To the preceding truths, I add another which ari&s;es immediately from them.</P>
<P>The &s;ame organic ela&s;ticity, which cau&s;es the extreme force of the pa&s;&s;ions, renders Man frank and open-hearted; for the &s;oul cannot conceal its emotions, they ru&s;h out precipitately, and appear in his ge&s;ture, &s;peech and voice; finally, the repre&s;&s;ing of the&s;e emotions is ever painful,
<PB N="141" REF="148">and even impo&s;&s;ible, when the &s;oul is &s;trongly affected. Re&s;erve is peculiar to &s;ouls united to organs of lax or very gro&s;s fibres; frankne&s;s, to &s;ouls united to or|gans of extreme organic ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>Men of great &s;en&s;ibility and liveline&s;s, always &s;peak the language which &s;prings from the heart, the language of truth; thus it is by warming the heart of him who is naturally cold, that is, by aug|menting his &s;en&s;ibility, by increa&s;ing the ela&s;ticity of his fibres, that wine bani&s;hes re&s;erve and lays open the heart.</P>
<P>Thus no credit is to be given to per&s;ons of known di&s;&s;imulation and habitual re|&s;erve, unle&s;s in the paroxy&s;ms of pa&s;&s;ion. Then only are their words without di&s;|gui&s;e; in the&s;e moments, the violence of the emotions of the &s;oul augments the ten&s;ion of the fibres, affects them with a &s;light rigidity, frees them from the em|pire of the will<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See ob&s;ervations 62, Book III.</NOTE>, makes them drop the ma&s;k and appear without di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>When you pre&s;s the cha&s;te mi&s;tre&s;s of your heart to lay open her mind to you,
<PB N="142" REF="149">although &s;he &s;ubmits with regret to the le&s;&s;ons of her mother, and to the &s;evere laws of mode&s;ty, &s;he neverthele&s;s divulges not her true &s;entiments; &s;he allows &s;he has a friend&s;hip for you, and nothing more. But when wearied out with a long and painful re&s;i&s;tance, the di&s;&s;embling fair permits her lover to triumph; while love fires her veins; while &s;he embraces her beloved with tran&s;ports; cla&s;ps him in her arms; pre&s;&s;es him to her eager bo&s;om, and her humid lips attract and di&s;til plea&s;ure; her voice is broken and faultering, &s;carce|ly can &s;he articulate a few words&mdash;ex|pre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s and love.</P>

<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations on the Manner in which Orga|ganization renders <HI>MAN</HI> obdurate and cruel, compa&s;&s;ionate and humane.</HEAD>
<P>Let us again examine the effects of the primitive and organic ela&s;ticity of the fi|bres; for what a diver&s;ity in the moral character is produced by the different de|grees of the&s;e corporeal faculties! What &s;urpri&s;ing phenomena, of which they are the cau&s;e! Principles the mo&s;t fertile!
<PB N="143" REF="150">Principles! who&s;e extent, when fully known, demon&s;trate them to be almo&s;t inexhau&s;tible.</P>
<P>We do not compa&s;&s;ionate the mi&s;erable, but from an idea of his &s;ufferings; we have no idea of pain till we have experienced it our&s;elves: if, therefore, to bemoan others, we mu&s;t have &s;uffered our&s;elves, &s;en&s;ibili|ty is a di&s;po&s;ition ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pity.</P>
<P>If united to gro&s;s organs, or to fibres too &s;olid or too lax, the &s;oul becomes obdu|rate and inflexible; when united to or|gans delicate, ela&s;tic and vigorous, it be|comes compa&s;&s;ionate and tender. Hence pity, although an artificial &s;entiment, is neverthele&s;s, in every individual, modified by the organization.</P>
<P>The greater the &s;en&s;ibility of Man, he may thence be the more humane; and by a very &s;ingular con&s;equence, he may thence be the more cruel. For if, to bemaon others, we mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible our&s;elves, it is equally true, that we di&s;cover only that &s;en|&s;ibility for others which we want not our|&s;elves. The more &s;en&s;ible any one is, the more a&s;&s;iduous is he to avoid pain, the
<PB N="144" REF="151">more eager after plea&s;ure, the more en|gro&s;&s;ed by him&s;elf, and the le&s;s concerned for others. If, in the&s;e ca&s;es, &s;en&s;ibility be fixed on the &s;en&s;ual or artificial pa&s;&s;ions, which have neither genero&s;ity, clemency, nor goodne&s;s, for their object; the voice of plea&s;ure drowns that of pity; the heart is contracted and &s;hrunk within it&s;elf, the &s;oul, full of the object of its de&s;ires, denies its attention to every thing be&s;ides, and is no long either clement or humane. If the well-being of others be incon&s;i&s;tent with our own, the&s;e affections become more extreme; for if it be a con&s;equence of the love of our&s;elves, to love tho&s;e things which are beneficial, &s;o likewi&s;e it mu&s;t be, to hate tho&s;e which are prejudicial to us. Thus they, whom we now look upon with indifference, become the object of our mo&s;t extreme hatred, when we regard them as enemies; in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion we treat them with the greate&s;t virulence, relentle&s;sly &s;eek their ruin, aggravate their mi&s;ery, and view their &s;ufferings with an eye of &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The more &s;en&s;ible likewi&s;e Man is, the more fearful he is of pain, and the
<PB N="145" REF="152">more timid; the fear of his enemy prompts him to complete his de&s;truction, when|ever opportunity offers. Let us therefore conclude, that the more &s;en&s;ible a Man is, the more he is obnoxious to hatred, his cruelty is greater, and the more atrocious his character.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on, which modifies pity in our hearts, is drawn from that di&s;po&s;ition of the body which characteri&s;es the tem|per of the mind.</P>
<P>I have &s;hewn that the melancholy hu|mour, by centering Man's thoughts in him&s;elf, renders him un&s;ociable, obdurate and cruel.</P>
<P>That, which con&s;titutes good humour, is much more favourable to pity; yet in &s;ome particular in&s;tances le&s;s &s;o. In the gay, the &s;entiment of plea&s;ure, ever pre|dominant in the &s;oul, nouri&s;hes therein ideas of joy, and the &s;ight of the unhap|py generates tho&s;e of &s;adne&s;s. The&s;e therefore are weakened by the former, and con&s;equently make not their full im|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition of the body, which con&s;titutes &s;erenity of temper, is much
<PB N="146" REF="153">more favourable; as it leaves Man the en|tire liberty of his mental faculties, and changes not the impre&s;&s;ion of objects.</P>
<P>But of all di&s;po&s;itions of the body, that is the mo&s;t favourable which con&s;titutes the tender character, that di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;oul which determines it to compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Man who is con&s;titutionally &s;ad may be ju&s;t and &s;incere; the gay may be equitable and meek; and a Man of a &s;e|rene temper may po&s;&s;e&s;s the virtues of both. But it is only to the Man of a delicate con&s;titution of body, that Nature has given a compa&s;&s;ionate heart; on him only has &s;he be&s;towed that noble propen&s;ity to clemency, that genero&s;ity of &s;oul, which takes plea&s;ure in mingling tears with the afflicted, in melting at another's woe, and relieving the oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Let us add, that it is the &s;ame di&s;po&s;i|tion of body which generates in our hearts, that goodne&s;s which prevents the reque&s;ts of others, and that ea&s;y communicability of heart, which, in a moment, contracts the mo&s;t durable friend&s;hips, produces that &s;en&s;ibility and tendency of mind,

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Influence of <HI>ORGANIZATION</HI> on the Mind.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT an a&s;toni&s;hing variety of minds! How different their cha|racters!</P>
<P>All men compare and combine their &s;en&s;ations to a certain degree; but every one is not equally capable of comparing and generalizing them, and of forming therefrom ideas and new combinations. All have not the gift of invention, nay, not even that of perfecting what is alrea|dy invented. How few are able to think of them&s;elves! How many others, yet more confined, who cannot think at all, but are ever chained down to imitation,
<PB N="151" REF="158">never doing any thing but what they have &s;een done before, nor &s;aying any thing but what they have heard &s;aid, as if endowed with in&s;tinct only, and entirely de&s;titute of judgment!</P>
<P>In di&s;tingui&s;hing the operations of the mind relatively to their objects, we find, that the greate&s;t part of mankind are con|&s;ined to the combination of &s;en&s;ations, and that but very few can attain to that of ideas; but among&s;t the &s;mall number of tho&s;e who think, what diver&s;ity appears!</P>
<P>There are &s;ome who&s;e activity of &s;oul is &s;uch, that they can never &s;eize any principle, without tracing it to its mo&s;t di&s;tant con&s;equences. There are others, and of the&s;e the number is very great, who&s;e le&s;s active &s;ouls let every con&s;e|quence e&s;cape them, which has not a cer|tain degree of evidence at fir&s;t &s;ight, and &s;eize tho&s;e only which pre&s;ent them&s;elves.</P>
<P>How different likewi&s;e their character! In one, judgment is the chief power of the mind; in another, imagination; this is fertile in ideas; that other has &s;olidity of judgment; this is more impetuous, &s;upe|rior in argument; that rea&s;ons more
<PB N="152" REF="159">clo&s;ely, and is more conci&s;e; this excites admiration by his lively fallies, that by the force and &s;olidity of his eloquence &s;ilences, guides and governs us.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this diver&s;ity of minds has been ineffectually &s;ought; but if any one &s;ufficiently attends, he will di&s;cover this, as well as the character of the heart, to proceed from the di&s;po&s;ition of the corporeal organs.</P>

<P>There are &s;ome men, who&s;e active &s;ouls receive few &s;en&s;ations without comparing them; the&s;e are the mo&s;t ingenious.</P>
<P>There are others who compare only a certain kind of &s;en&s;ations; the&s;e are le&s;s ingenious than the former, and &s;o much the le&s;s &s;o, as their &s;ouls have a le&s;s pro|pen&s;ity to compare their &s;en&s;ations, and to form ideas therefrom. The &s;ouls of others again are &s;o little active, and &s;o greatly aver&s;e to thinking, that they neither com|pare
<PB N="154" REF="161">nor combine any thing at fir&s;t &s;ight; they require &s;en&s;ations which are both &s;trong, and many times repeated, before they are brought to compare them, and to form any idea: &s;uch, being more or le&s;s &s;tupid, differ not from the weak minds, but in the &s;mall number of their ideas, which they &s;o laboriou&s;ly produce.</P>
<P>No man de&s;ires to know, but becau&s;e he de&s;ires to be happy: he who is without de&s;ires, and without fears, will certainly not give him&s;elf the trouble of comparing his &s;en&s;ations, of combining his ideas, and rea&s;oning therefrom.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ion therefore is the cau&s;e of this activity of &s;oul, this perpetual fermenta|tion of rea&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The curio&s;ity of children, and tho&s;e deci&s;ive propen&s;ities, which many &s;uppo&s;e natural, and which &s;ome philo&s;ophers pretend to deduce from in|&s;tinct, have no other &s;ource. This curio&s;ity ari&s;es from their having been taught to look upon &s;cience as happine&s;s, and con&s;equently that it was greatly their intere&s;t to acquire knowledge. The&s;e propen&s;ities ari&s;e from the plea&s;ure men find in particular employ|ments.</NOTE>; without it, the mind, unaffected, un&s;upported, falls into a lan|guor, and is immer&s;ed in &s;loth.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="162">The mind therefore <HI>thinks</HI> only when it has an <HI>intere&s;t</HI> in <HI>thinking:</HI> this intere&s;t may be of many kinds; one finds it in the plea&s;ure which he receives from the knowledge of things; another in the plea|&s;ure he takes in di&s;playing his learning, and attracting regard; a third in the means of procuring the conveniences of life by his knowledge. But whatever the object may be, the pa&s;&s;ions ever ac|tuate the mind; by their activity its fa|culties unfold and ri&s;e to perfection. To arrive at excellence of any kind, Man mu&s;t be animated by &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion; and the more violent his eagerne&s;s to &s;ucceed, the more efficacious are his efforts for that purpo&s;e. For only the violent pa&s;&s;ions produce illu&s;trious, heroic and great men: he who is animated by no pa&s;&s;ion, does nothing to render him&s;elf illu&s;trious, and is wholly in&s;ignificant. <HI>Men therefore are more or le&s;s ingenious, as they po&s;&s;e&s;s greater or le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility.</HI></P>
<P>The human under&s;tanding is undoubt|edly greatly indebted to the pa&s;&s;ions; but if the pa&s;&s;ions are nece&s;&s;ary to render the mind active, they are not &s;ufficient to pro|duce
<PB N="156" REF="163">a creative imagination, or a great genius: they can indeed render Man eager after &s;ucce&s;s; but they &s;upply not the qualities, which are nece&s;&s;ary to the ac|qui&s;ition of it. Some phy&s;ical di&s;po&s;itions therefore are required, together with the &s;en&s;ibility of our organs.</P>
<P>Let us inquire into the nature of the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>At our birth none of the mental facul|ties is unfolded, none in exerci&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book II. Art. Of the unfolding of our men|tal faculties.</NOTE>, not even in&s;tinct. But whether the &s;oul ex|i&s;ted before its union with the body, or whether it had any peculiar method of acquiring knowledge or not, it is mo&s;t certain, that when once it has become &s;ubject to the laws of this union, it no longer retains aught of its former &s;tate, not even the remembrance of it.</P>
<P>Every man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of judg|ing; but even although we &s;uppo&s;e that every man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it alike, the minds of individuals would not be le&s;s different; for the under&s;tanding can never proceed
<PB N="157" REF="164">alone; but requires the concurrence of the &s;en&s;itive faculty, or rather that of the &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>Examine the productions of the human mind, the mo&s;t &s;ingular works of imagi|nation, even tho&s;e which have the lea&s;t analogy to nature; all have for their &s;ub|ject, &s;en&s;ible objects, or relations of the&s;e objects. Almo&s;t all our thoughts are cor|poreal images, and of the mo&s;t ab&s;tract ideas there is none which is not fixed by the &s;en&s;es; there is not throughout all nature a work of the pure intellect. If we de&s;ired, for in&s;tance, to form any idea of the Deity, or his attributes, we &s;hould con&s;ider him under human relations; at one time, as a beneficent father: at ano|ther, as a glorious King; now, as a be|nevolent ma&s;ter; then, as an offended Judge.</P>
<P>He who would ri&s;e to the fir&s;t of Be|ings, and contemplate him in his e&s;&s;ence without the aid of corporeal images, per|ceiving no relation between God and him|&s;elf, knows not how to form any notion of him, and is lo&s;t in the &s;ublimity of the idea. Thus all religions are &s;upported by
<PB N="158" REF="165">a gro&s;s wor&s;hip, which interpo&s;es mate|rial objects between the &s;upreme Being and Man. One contemplates the Deity in his works, another wor&s;hips him under an imaginary re&s;emblance; for the heart, as well as the mind, is ever fixed by the intervention of the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus likewi&s;e, when we form to our|&s;elves a notion of the &s;oul, we ever repre|&s;ent it as a thin &s;hade, or &s;ubtil matter; in &s;hort, as a corporeal being, if we form any image of it at all.</P>
<P>What&s;oever object we chu&s;e, the ca&s;e is the &s;ame; for let us employ our utmo&s;t efforts to form ideas wholly intellectual, or to conceive pure &s;pirituality, the only con&s;equence of the attempt is to involve the mind in greater darkne&s;s and confu|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Every idea therefore is formed from the true or fal&s;e relations of &s;en&s;ible objects; whence the under&s;tanding never operates without the concurrence of the &s;en&s;ations: in proportion as they are removed from their objects, the ideas we would convey become unintelligible; without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance our ideas either e&s;cape us, or they are ne|ver formed at all.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="166">Let us conclude from the preceding, that the &s;en&s;ations are the ba&s;is of all our knowledge.</P>
<P>What a variety of minds therefore mu&s;t be produced by the different &s;tructure of the organs of the &s;en&s;es, the only means whereby we can have communication with the various beings which &s;urround us.</P>
<P>Our knowledge is neither increa&s;ed nor perfected but by the comparing our &s;en&s;ations. The greater the number of &s;en&s;ations to be compared, &s;o much the more numerous are our ideas; the more di&s;tinct the&s;e &s;en&s;ations, &s;o much the more clear are our conceptions, and the more exact the&s;e compari&s;ons, the more perfect our knowledge mu&s;t be. On the contrary, the &s;maller the number of our &s;en&s;ations, the more confined is the &s;phere of mental activity, and the le&s;s numerous our ideas; not only from the privation of tho&s;e ideas which are founded on the &s;en&s;a|tions of the &s;en&s;e we are without: but from the privation of many others; for it is evident that, as all the parts of ha|ture are connected, the &s;en&s;ations of one &s;en&s;e often &s;erve to di&s;cover the relations of the &s;en&s;ations of another &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="167">The number of our ideas mu&s;t there|fore be relative to the number and &s;truc|ture of the&s;e organs: whence <HI>Man mu&s;t be le&s;s intelligent, le&s;s ingenious, in proportion as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;maller number of &s;en&s;es, and as his &s;en&s;es are le&s;s exqui&s;ite.</HI></P>
<P>Although there is an intimate relation between the number of &s;en&s;ations and that of ideas, this relation is not equal with regard to every &s;en&s;e; one &s;en&s;e may be confined whil&s;t another is le&s;s &s;o.</P>
<P>From a calculation of the number of the objects of the &s;en&s;es, the organ of &s;melling appears to be the mo&s;t confined, and that of &s;eeing the lea&s;t &s;o. The eye is of all the bodily organs the mo&s;t com|prehen&s;ive, and takes in the greate&s;t num|ber of objects; forms, dimen&s;ions, co|lours, are all within its di&s;trict; the va|rieties it perceives in each of the&s;e modi|fications of matter infinitely &s;urpa&s;s all tho&s;e within the cognizance of the ta&s;te, &s;melling, hearing, and feeling; that is, of &s;ounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I con&s;ider not the car as the organ of &s;ounds, the conventional &s;igns of our thoughts, and I look upon the eye in the &s;ame light.

<P>With regard to the nature of our &s;en&s;a|tions, it is very evident, that, from the different &s;tructure of the &s;en&s;es in different individuals, there mu&s;t be a great diver&s;i|ty in their re&s;pective impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Every object mu&s;t naturally produce on Man, an agreeable or painful impre&s;&s;ion; for every Man is a &s;en&s;ible being, and eve|ry &s;en&s;ible being mu&s;t be &s;u&s;ceptible of either plea&s;ure or pain; but it does not therefore follow, that the &s;ame object &s;hould produce, in every individual, the &s;ame &s;en&s;ation; their re&s;pective &s;en&s;es not
<PB N="162" REF="169">being of &s;imilar organization. In what|ever manner material objects affect the &s;en&s;es, it is certain, that the &s;ame objects affect them not equally in every individu|al, and con&s;equently produce not in the &s;oul the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ions. The lilly is not beautiful to every eye, neither is the anana plea&s;ant to every palate, nor the &s;ong of the nightingale to every ear. I &s;hall not &s;peak here of the&s;e diver&s;ities in the &s;en&s;ations of individuals, as their cau&s;e is utterly unknown; but &s;hall attend to tho&s;e which are more evident and better under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The chief differences between the &s;en|&s;ations of different individuals con&s;i&s;t in their delicacy, in the greatne&s;s of their image, and in the number of the objects compo&s;ing the picture; the two la&s;t &s;pe|cies of the&s;e differences are peculiar to the organ of &s;ight, the other is common to all the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>The more delicate an organ is, the bet|ter it perceives tho&s;e minute objects which e&s;cape organs which are le&s;s &s;o. The de|licacy of the &s;en&s;es is often nece&s;&s;ary to the acqui&s;ition of many &s;orts of know|ledge;
<PB N="163" REF="170">we are indebted for the di&s;covery of the Satellites of Jupiter, and other ce|le&s;tial bodies, of the animalcula in liquors, and of the minutiae of anatomy, to tho&s;e in&s;truments which have been contrived to &s;upply the imperfection of our &s;en&s;es. The&s;e &s;upplements have advanced our knowledge in many re&s;pects beyond the point to which it had arrived a few ages ago, and have, in our times, conduced to the di&s;covery of many great and impor|tant truths.

<HEAD>Organization a&s;&s;i&s;tant or an Hindrance to the unfolding of the <HI>MENTAL FACUL|TIES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>It is unknown whether the &s;oul, when di&s;united from the body, can perceive, think, or remember its &s;en&s;ations and ideas or not; but it is certain, that, when once it is united to the body, the unfolding of its faculties depends entirely on the &s;tate of the body with which it is yoked. Let us endeavour to di&s;cover the latent rea&s;ons of this important truth.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="177">Without &s;en&s;ations there can be no ideas, as has been already demon&s;trated; but if all our ideas are founded on the &s;en&s;ations, they likewi&s;e depend on the under&s;tanding by which they are formed. The mind cannot form them in the &s;ame manner in every individual, nor can it form them always in the &s;ame manner in the &s;ame per&s;on.</P>
<P>When the impre&s;&s;ions of objects are made on the organ, and the &s;en&s;ations are received by the &s;oul, all the functions of the &s;en&s;es are di&s;charged, but not all the functions of the body.</P>
<P>To judge of the relations of objects, we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e objects with care, examine and compare them under their different appearances: this requires attention.</P>
<P>Attention is the parent of all know|ledge: attention, by applying the mind to the con&s;ideration of beings, di&s;covers to us their different properties: attention, by fixing it upon the different phenomena of Nature, inve&s;tigates its unknown laws and its &s;ecret relations, which otherwi&s;e e&s;cape us: attention produces, from the
<PB N="171" REF="178">various combinations of our ob&s;ervations, tho&s;e &s;ublime di&s;coveries, tho&s;e admirable inventions, tho&s;e prodigies of &s;cience, tho&s;e productions of genius, which have been in &s;o many various ways beneficial to man|kind. Without attention every pheno|menon in nature is lo&s;t to us; in vain is the &s;oul endued with &s;uch noble faculties, in vain does the univer&s;e offer its va&s;t and wonderful volume to our &s;ight.</P>
<P>Attention is &s;trengthened by being con|centrated; it then &s;u&s;pends all the other faculties of the mind, and &s;eems to have intire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul. On the con|trary, it is weakened by being divid|ed: when it has got half way in a geo|metrical demon&s;tration, if any &s;ingular object affect our organs, the mind is in|&s;tantly di&s;tracted, &s;uffers it&s;elf to be en|gro&s;&s;ed by this object, and after it has wan|dered a while, endeavours in vain to re|&s;ume the thread of its former thoughts. Thus every &s;en&s;ation foreign to the object pre&s;ent in the mind, diverts and de&s;troys the attention.</P>
<P>To examine objects, to reflect, to me|ditate, the mind mu&s;t be perfectly calm;
<PB N="172" REF="179">no &s;en&s;ation, no foreign &s;entiment, mu&s;t then affect the &s;oul. <HI>The fir&s;t thing therefore nece&s;&s;ary to the free exerci&s;e of thought, and to the unfolding of the intellectual faculties, is that the &s;oul be united to a body, who&s;e vital functions</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book IV.

<P>But it is not enough that the &s;oul be united to a body in perfect health, and ex|empt from di&s;ea&s;e; for, that the body may not di&s;tract the &s;oul from the objects on which it is intent, the &s;en&s;ation which re&s;ults from the action of our organs mu&s;t be imperceptible.

<HEAD>Organization renders the Under&s;tanding ei|ther ju&s;t, exten&s;ive, delicate, profound; or &s;uperficial, confined, erroneous and gro&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>Our intellectual faculties are neither developed nor improved, but in propor|tion as the mind compares its &s;en&s;ations. The more it compares them, the more it di&s;covers their relations, and the more numerous are our ideas; the more care|fully it examines them, &s;o much the more perfect is our knowledge.</P>
<P>I have di&s;tingui&s;hed two powers of the under&s;tanding, that of perceiving and con|&s;idering objects, and that of pronouncing on their relations. The fir&s;t is the ba&s;is of the &s;econd, and nece&s;&s;arily precedes it. What then is requi&s;ite to enable the mind to form a &s;ound judgment of things? An accurate perception of them. It is therefore on the greater or le&s;s degree of attention we employ in examining
<PB N="176" REF="183">objects, or rather on the different apti|tude of the mind for attention, combined with the time it is able to &s;upport it, that the ju&s;tne&s;s of our judgments and the character of our ideas depend.</P>
<P>To acquire profound ideas, we mu&s;t for a long time, and without di&s;traction, contemplate the &s;ame objects, con&s;ider their relations, their difference, examine, compare and combine them in many dif|ferent &s;hapes, that we may afterwards con&s;ider them under unob&s;erved appear|ances, and di&s;cover their hidden relations.</P>
<P>I will not however &s;ay, that every great di&s;covery has been made by gradual &s;eries of combinations and complicated ob&s;erva|tions. Sometimes the mind overlooks the intermediate &s;pace, and perceives its ob|ject at a di&s;tance amid&s;t &s;urrounding darkne&s;s: but if in this manner it arrive at truth, it mu&s;t neverthele&s;s return to ob&s;ervation, to experience, and to this gradual &s;eries of combinations, to verify the&s;e new ideas, and connect them to o|thers which have been already acquired. Thus having at once traver&s;ed an immen&s;e &s;pace, it is afterwards obliged to pa&s;s over
<PB N="177" REF="184">every intermediate degree which &s;eparates the two extremes, returning circularly to the point from whence it at fir&s;t &s;et out. Such is the progre&s;s of the human mind in di&s;coveries of every &s;ort.</P>
<P>Thus a per&s;on de&s;irous to acquire new knowledge, or verify that which he has already acquired, can never accompli&s;h his de&s;ign, but by a long and clo&s;e exami|nation of the phenomena of nature.</P>
<P>It is therefore only to attention more or le&s;s &s;trong, more or le&s;s continued<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This attention is not the &s;ame with that which is required in &s;tudying the languages; in this latter, every thing is unconnected; in the former, every thing is connected: in the one, the mind relieves it&s;elf by employing attention but at intervals, when prompt|ed by the will, and by pa&s;&s;ing from one object to ano|ther; but in the other, the &s;ame &s;ubject requires conti|nued attention, the &s;oul cannot examine and repo&s;e it|&s;elf alternately. He who de&s;ires to divide his time be|tween the examination of objects and repo&s;e, is ever at a &s;tand in his ob&s;ervations, is con&s;tantly di&s;tracted in his thoughts, is perpetually obliged to recommence the &s;ame labour, and never profits by his pains.</NOTE>, that we owe the &s;uperficiality or profundity of ideas.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="185">This different aptitude of the mind for attention, and the &s;pace of time it is able to &s;upport it, ab&s;olutely depend on organiza|tion: for the mind becomes fatigued ju&s;t as the body does, and both at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>It is unknown whether the &s;oul is re|ally fatigued; for our knowledge of things is not &s;ufficient to demon&s;trate whether an immaterial &s;ub&s;tance is, or is not, naturally &s;u&s;ceptible of la&s;&s;itude; but without the lea&s;t doubt, the &s;oul, when once it is unit|ed to the body, and during the whole con|tinuance of its union therewith, experi|ences a &s;en&s;e of fatigue as frequently as the body.</P>
<P>Might I have leave to offer my opinion upon &s;o delicate a &s;ubject as this is, I would declare for the negative, and would &s;upport it thus.</P>
<P>Since the &s;en&s;e of la&s;&s;itude is common to both &s;oul and body when united, it is evident, that the &s;oul mu&s;t become fa|tigued together with the body.</P>
<P>The la&s;&s;itude of the mind is partly the la&s;&s;itude of the body it&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La&s;&s;itude of body is only an unplea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation, which ari&s;es from the too frequent and too continued ten&s;ion of the fibres, by which the nervous fluid which di&s;tends them is exhau&s;ted, their organic ela&s;ticity de|crea&s;ed, a languor &s;eizes the &s;en&s;es, and the whole bo|dy is affected with &s;tupor.</NOTE>, which is
<PB N="179" REF="186">communicated to it by the general organ of feeling, and probably it is no more than this; for &s;ince the mind, to be in|tent, requires the fibres to be ten&s;e, and as the fibres are ever fatigued by their ten|&s;ion, it is not to be wondered at that the &s;oul &s;hould cea&s;e to be intent, when the fibres cea&s;e to be ten&s;e, or, which is the &s;ame, the mind ever appears fatigued when the body is tired, and the body is tired at all times when the mind is fatigued. Be|&s;ides, we have no idea of the la&s;&s;itude of the &s;oul, but by the weakne&s;s of its thoughts and emotions, and by their &s;hort continu|ance on the &s;ame &s;ubject. When the bo|dy is tired, that is, when the organs are affected with languor, the functions of the &s;oul mu&s;t needs be languid, the ideas &s;carcely di&s;tinct, and the vivacity of the &s;entiments decayed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book IV. Art. the character of the &s;oul ever congruous to the &s;tate of the body.</NOTE>. This has been al|ready explained.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="187">It is therefore evident to me, that the la&s;&s;itude of the &s;oul is only la&s;&s;itude of the body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If our fatigue be &s;omewhat dimini&s;hed by a change of objects, it is not becau&s;e the &s;oul then acts upon others fibres, as a modern writer has &s;uppo&s;ed, but that the &s;oul, rou&s;ed by this new object, experiences a fre&s;h plea&s;ure, which partly conceals the prior &s;en&s;e of fatigue, and likewi&s;e, becau&s;e this new object of|ten requires a le&s;s degree of attention, which dimi|nution admini&s;ters &s;ome &s;ort of relaxation and repo&s;e. But if this new object require greater attention, &s;o far from relieving the fatigue of the &s;oul, it very &s;en|&s;ibly augments it. This we experience when we change the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory, for that of geometry, or the &s;uperficial peru&s;al of a romance, for &s;ome deep pro|blem in mathematics.</NOTE>, and that in this phenomenon, as in many others, the reality is concealed by the appearance.</P>
<P>But whether it be &s;o or not, this is cer|tain, that the mind is fatigued together with the body. This is an ob&s;ervation which univer&s;ally prevails, yet no one has hitherto thought proper to deduce the na|tural con&s;equences from it.</P>
<P>When the body is fatigued, admitting that the &s;oul really fatigues the body by application, let us be ever &s;o de&s;irous to continue our meditation, and make what|ever
<PB N="181" REF="188">efforts we plea&s;e, we cannot long keep the mind fixed on the &s;ame object, nor fix it there for any time &s;trongly. <HI>The &s;oul therefore cannot continue its attention, when the fibres have lo&s;t their ten&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>It is therefore erroneous to &s;uppo&s;e, as many philo&s;ophers have done, that our aptitude for attention &s;olely depends on the power of the pa&s;&s;ions. It is true, that the greater intere&s;t we take in applying our&s;elves to any particular &s;tudy, the longer we can &s;upport attention; pa&s;&s;ion can then employ the whole &s;trength of the body, but nothing more: hence let the pa&s;&s;ion be ever &s;o violent, <HI>attention is always proportionate to the ela&s;ticity and force of the fibres.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, forced attention is more preju|dicial than favourable to our &s;tudy. In the fir&s;t place, it cannot be very &s;trong, from the painful &s;en&s;ation which ever ac|companies it: its duration likewi&s;e is very &s;hort; for when the organs are once wea|ried, they act but with little force; be|&s;ides, the body is exhau&s;ted by tho&s;e vio|lent efforts, and Man lo&s;es by its di&s;ordered &s;tate all the time which he endeavours to
<PB N="182" REF="189">gain by this prolongation of attention, and &s;ometimes even more.</P>
<P>Such are the phy&s;ical cau&s;es of many diver&s;ities of mind; cau&s;es which have hitherto been unnoticed by philo&s;ophers, although they &s;o naturally ari&s;e on exami|ning the phenomena I have now under|taken to explain. And here let us repeat our fir&s;t principle, in order to a combina|tion of its effects, and that we may de|duce its proper con&s;equences.</P>
<P><HI>Attention is ever proportionate to the or|ganic ela&s;ticity and force of the fibres.</HI> To pro|duce profoundideas, the mind therefore mu&s;t be united to organs compo&s;ed of fibres which are both &s;trong and ela&s;tic; the mind, if united to in-ela&s;tic and weak organs, is trifling and &s;upercifial in its operations. Thus a Man, who&s;e con&s;titution is deli|cate and &s;en&s;ible, is not capable of pro|found di&s;qui&s;itions: too weak to &s;u&s;tain long meditation, and too &s;en&s;ible to lead a contemplative life, he beholds Na|ture without attending to particular parts, ince&s;&s;antly flies from object to object, glances upon them, and dips not beneath the &s;urface.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="190">However, I do not pretend to &s;ay, that every man of &s;trong and vigorous con&s;ti|tution is thus profound; for, be&s;ides this phy&s;ical di&s;po&s;ition, his talents mu&s;t be cultivated; all I would be under&s;tood to &s;ay is, that only a man of &s;uch a con&s;ti|tution of bodily organs can arrive at this &s;tate; others may, indeed, have a great number of ju&s;t and &s;olid ideas, but never tho&s;e which are profound and well con|nected. That &s;ublime knowledge, which is derived from the con&s;tant &s;tudy of Na|ture, is what they are unable to acquire of them&s;elves; on the contrary, they mu&s;t be initiated in it by others: their minds may be congenial with the minds of Pope and Voltaire, but will never ri&s;e to the dignity of Newton's or de Monte&s;quieu's; they may be called men of wit and learning, but never men of depth.</P>
<P>To be ju&s;t, our ideas mu&s;t be di&s;tinct; but the&s;e qualities are not always united. To conceive di&s;tinctly, it is &s;ufficient that our &s;en&s;ations be well expre&s;&s;ed, and that the mind be exact in pronouncing on their apparent relations; but to conceive ju&s;tly, there is required a perfect knowledge of
<PB N="184" REF="191">every relation nece&s;&s;ary to form a &s;olid judgment. Thus ideas may be di&s;tinct, yet not be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>We may therefore from this cau&s;e, rea|&s;on ju&s;tly upon one article and fal&s;ely upon another; but in every ca&s;e, where to di&s;|cover the true relations of beings, it is re|qui&s;ite that we attentively examine them; in every ca&s;e where the knowledge of things is the re&s;ult of a great number of complicated combinations; in every ca&s;e where truth is difficultly obtained, and where there is a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeing much, if we de&s;ire to &s;ee well, the ju&s;tne&s;s of our judgments depends on the capacity of the mind, and on its profoundne&s;s, or rather, ju&s;tne&s;s and profoundne&s;s require the &s;ame degree of attention of the &s;oul, and the &s;ame organic di&s;po&s;ition of the body. With feeble and delicate organs, therefore, Man is incapable of this ju&s;tne&s;s of judg|ment: too weak to con&s;ider objects under their various appearances &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and too feeble to pur&s;ue the connexion of things, and to collect a multiplicity of ideas in the &s;ame point; he &s;uffers many things to e&s;cape, from an inability to retain them,
<PB N="185" REF="192">and examines ha&s;tily tho&s;e which remain: thus pa&s;&s;ing &s;lightly over many objects, and judging of the whole by his imper|fect knowledge of a part, he forms de|ductions nece&s;&s;arily fal&s;e and inconclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>Ideas are particular or general relatively to their object. The &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition of organs which is nece&s;&s;ary to the acqui&s;i|tion of profound ideas, is likewi&s;e ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the acqui&s;ition of tho&s;e which are univer&s;al: for the univer&s;ality of ideas re&s;ults from the multitude of relations, which the under&s;tanding perceives, unites and collects into one and the &s;ame point of view. The faculty of comprehending the &s;y&s;tem of Nature is therefore given only to tho&s;e, who&s;e fibres are endued with force and great organic ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>Another effect of this organization of the body, which we could never have &s;u&s;|pected and &s;carcely believe, although it is demon&s;trated, is, that it is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to delicacy of &s;en&s;ations and ideas.</P>
<P>It is an opinion univer&s;ally received by philo&s;ophers, that the &s;en&s;es are perfected by u&s;e, and that they are improved by &s;eeing, feeling, ta&s;ting, &amp;c. ju&s;t as the mind is improved by rea&s;oning.</P>

<PB N="187" REF="194">to exerci&s;e, to be very erroneous; for exerci&s;e neither changes the texture of our organs, nor adds to their delicacy. It is true that, by exerci&s;ing the &s;en&s;es, a greater quantity of nervous fluid is de|termined into their organs, whereby their &s;en&s;ibility is increa&s;ed: but he, who en|deavours to view minute objects for the fir&s;t time, has the organ of &s;ight equally ten&s;e with him who is accu&s;tomed to di&s;|tingui&s;h them at the fir&s;t glance, although he can neither &s;ee nor remark any thing. It is not therefore to the organ but to the &s;oul which receives the &s;en&s;ation, that we are to attribute the cau&s;e of this phe|nomenon.</P>
<P>This pretended delicacy of the &s;en&s;es ari&s;es only from the attention which the mind gives to the &s;malle&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of objects affecting it; for whether we ex|erci&s;e our organs or not, the delicacy of the &s;en&s;es continues the &s;ame. But the
<PB N="188" REF="195">mind, being attentive to the &s;en&s;ations it receives, gradually becomes able to di&s;|cern the &s;malle&s;t differences, which are too weak to be perceived by a &s;ingle effort of the attention. Be&s;ides, it is not in the organs of &s;en&s;e that the &s;oul perceives, but in it&s;elf; there the pro&s;pect of nature ex|i&s;ts. We mu&s;t therefore look on &s;en&s;ibi|lity as a tablet, upon which are repre&s;ented the images of the objects which affect us, and wherein the under&s;tanding perceives them. As the&s;e repre&s;entations have parts of a&s;tronger or weaker colouring, more or le&s;s luminous, more or le&s;s di&s;tinct: &s;o &s;ome of the&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book II. Art. Exerci&s;e of the Under&s;tanding.</NOTE> more &s;trongly engage the mind than others; tho&s;e which are weak|ly coloured, and are the repre&s;entations of very minute objects, are almo&s;t im|perceptible; &s;uch are not perceived at fir&s;t &s;ight, but mu&s;t be &s;ought for with atten|tion before they are found. If a painter perceive at the fir&s;t glance the defects of a painting; if a &s;hepherd ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h his &s;heep; this proceeds from no other cau&s;e, than that both are accu&s;tomed to
<PB N="189" REF="196">turn their attention to the&s;e objects more frequently than to any other. Thus a very great number of delicate &s;en&s;ations, re|ceived by a &s;oul united to &s;trong and e|la&s;tic organs, are lo&s;t when united to or|gans de&s;titute both of &s;trength and vigour.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid of the &s;en&s;ations is true in regard to ideas likewi&s;e; for it is only by long continued attention that we can make tho&s;e delicate ob&s;erva|tions, and acquire tho&s;e refined ideas which e&s;cape the generality of men.</P>
<P>Thus the difference of the force and ela&s;ticity of our fibres is a new &s;ource of the diver&s;ity of minds.</P>

<P>The mind is endued with the faculty of judging, but judges not always in the &s;ame manner; at one time its thoughts are connected with each other; at another they are without either continuance or connection; &s;ometimes they &s;ucceed each other with rapidity, and &s;ometimes the rever&s;e.</P>

But with per&s;ons both healthy and awake, the &s;en&s;ations have a moderate degree of force, the ideas are di&s;tinct, the &s;oul com|pares them, and di&s;po&s;es them in a regu|lar and orderly &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If we maturely con&s;ider the&s;e phenome|na, we &s;hall di&s;cover their cau&s;e to con&s;i&s;t in the different tone of the fibres, whil&s;t a&s;leep or awake, in a healthy or di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of the body. In &s;leep, this tone is too feeble to promote the ju&s;tne&s;s of our thoughts, and the regularity of their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion; in an inflammatory fever, the tone is, on the contrary, too &s;trong: a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of thoughts, therefore, always requires a certain degree of ten&s;ion, or rather a moderate degree of organic ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>As the&s;e ideas are too &s;ingular, the&s;e principles too new, to be received without farther confirmation, I &s;hall proceed to
<PB N="194" REF="201">give the cleare&s;t evidence of their truth. Man has two modes of exi&s;tence, &s;leeping and waking; in this latter every &s;pring of the machine is in action; in the former, tho&s;e only which are allotted for the con|tinuation of the vital functions.</P>
<P>Sleep is e&s;&s;ential to Man; it is the ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of his con&s;titution, and of the laws of the animal oeconomy: by the&s;e laws he pa&s;&s;es from a &s;leeping to a waking &s;tate; by the&s;e laws likewi&s;e the time of waking nece&s;&s;arily &s;ucceeds that of repo&s;e, and both are independant of every external cau&s;e. For Man can &s;ub&s;i&s;t for a determinate &s;pace only, in either of the&s;e &s;tates: by continual watching, the ince&s;|&s;ant motion of the fibres would de&s;troy their organic ela&s;ticity, and prevent their future reparation; &s;o by continual &s;leep|ing, though the fibres are not fatigued, the nervous fluid would be gradually ex|hau&s;ted by the action of the organs of life, and would never be repaired.</P>
<P>The continuance of either of the&s;e two modes of exi&s;tence, would therefore ne|ce&s;&s;arily be attended with a total ce&s;&s;ation of vital motion.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="202">At the approach of &s;leep, the mu&s;cles relax, the neck &s;eems unable to &s;upport the head, the arms yield to their own weight, the &s;en&s;es become inactive, the whole body &s;inks into repo&s;e, and the blood circulates with a &s;low and gentle pace. By attending to the di&s;po&s;ition of the organs of a man a&s;leep, and to the pheno|mena accompanying it, we di&s;cover, that this &s;tate is produced by the defect of the organical ela&s;ticity of the fibres. This relaxation is even &s;en&s;ible to the touch, the &s;kin of one a&s;leep being more moi&s;t, and the fibres &s;ofter than when awake. But were this relaxation imperceptible by the &s;en&s;es, the &s;imple examination of the cau&s;es of &s;leep will be &s;ufficient to confirm the truth of the principle here e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>It is an inconte&s;tible fact, that every thing which impairs the organic ela&s;ticity of the fibres, occa&s;ions &s;leep; and that every thing which increa&s;es this ela&s;ticity prevents it. The lo&s;s of nervous fluid in coition is immediately followed by a &s;light drow&s;ine&s;s: after the conflicts of love, the vivacity of our motions is dimini&s;hed, our de&s;ires are extinct, and we gradually &s;ink into repo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="203">The lo&s;s of the &s;ame fluid by labour produces the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>Though this lo&s;s of the nervous fluid be a principal cau&s;e of &s;leep, it is not the only one; let us repair it ever &s;o much by fre&s;h &s;upplies of aliments, &s;leep will not be the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary; this may prevent it for a &s;hort time, but afterwards &s;uffers it to return with new force. Thus the lo&s;s of nervous fluid is not alone produc|tive of it; &s;ince, not being exhau&s;ted of this fluid, Man &s;leeps not the le&s;s; &s;leep therefore is occa&s;ioned by a di&s;po&s;ition pe|culiar to the &s;olids; and this di&s;po&s;ition is no other than the la&s;&s;itude of the or|gans, produced by the ten&s;ion of the fibres when awake, or by the reiterated exten&s;ion and contraction of the mu&s;cles in motion.</P>
<P>Sleep therefore is cau&s;ed by the diminu|tion of the organic ela&s;ticity of the &s;olids, and by the diminution of their primitive ela&s;ticity; for it is certain, that an ela&s;tic body lo&s;es its primitive ela&s;ticity by fre|quent contraction. The fibres, after ex|treme ten&s;ion, relax, and their organic ela&s;ticity being impaired, the circulation
<PB N="197" REF="204">is &s;lowly performed, the &s;ecretion of the nervous fluid is ob&s;tructed, as likewi&s;e its influx into the organs of &s;en&s;e and mo|tion; whence re&s;ult a diminution of &s;en|&s;ibility, a weakne&s;s, and a general languor of the &s;en&s;ations, de&s;ires and ideas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a preceding Art. the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;oul is ever congruous to that of the body.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Although all communication between the &s;oul and the body appears interrupted during &s;leep, the&s;e two &s;ub&s;tances however have a con&s;tant relation one to the other. The &s;en&s;es are ever open to the action of external objects, and their &s;lighte&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions are conveyed to the &s;oul; but too weak to engage it, they only glance there|on without leaving any ve&s;tige behind; &s;trong &s;en&s;ations only can awaken and en|gage it. The&s;e are phenomena peculiar to &s;leep, and proper to confirm what has been already &s;aid concerning its cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e truths however are &s;upported by other phenomena. The fibres of per&s;ons greatly di&s;po&s;ed to &s;leep are feeble, and it is by &s;leep that our exi&s;tence commences. The infant, who&s;e fibres are endued but
<PB N="198" REF="205">with a very &s;mall degree of organic ela&s;|ticity, &s;leeps continually; children, who&s;e fibres are very weak, &s;leep more than they wake; in proportion as they advance in years, that is, in proportion as their fibres acquire &s;trength and ela&s;ticity, they en|dure more ea&s;ily the want of repo&s;e; wo|men, le&s;s &s;trong and le&s;s vigorous than men, have likewi&s;e more occa&s;ion for &s;leep. Phlegmatic men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is remarked, that geldings are le&s;s vigorous than hor&s;es, and likewi&s;e &s;leep more.</NOTE>, who&s;e fibres have but a &s;mall degree of organic ela&s;ti|city, con&s;ume the half of life in that &s;tate, and people, when recovering from any di&s;ea&s;e, &s;leep almo&s;t continually.</P>
<P>Another cau&s;e is, that every thing which impairs the force of the circulation by decrea&s;ing the ela&s;ticity of the fibres, as heat, emollient liquors, and whatever be|numbs the &s;olids, as &s;ulphureous vapours, &s;pirituous liquors and opium, ever pro|duces &s;leep.</P>
<P>In &s;ubjects which have died of a le|thargy, or of any &s;leepy di&s;ea&s;e, we find the head di&s;ordered, and the other parts &s;ound.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="206">Bonet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Sepuleretum Anatomicum.</NOTE>, who has collected a va&s;t number of ob&s;ervations of this kind, <Q>found a great quantity of extrava&s;ated &s;ero&s;ities in the brain of one who had died of a lethargy, &s;o that the <HI>cortical &s;ub&s;tance</HI> and the <HI>meninges</HI> were covered therewith. In another &s;ubject, that had never been attacked but once with any &s;leepy affection, the internal part of the <HI>cerebrum</HI> was full of extrava&s;ated &s;ero&s;ities.

<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations prove, that this con|tinual numbne&s;s is cau&s;ed by the diminu|tion, or even by the total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the influx of the nervous fluid into the organs of motion and &s;en&s;e; a natural effect of its vicious &s;ecretion, during the di&s;ten&s;ion of the cortical &s;ub&s;tance of the

Be|&s;ides it is well known, that the &s;imple pre&s;&s;ure of this <HI>vi&s;cus,</HI> after the removal of the <HI>cranium,</HI> produces &s;leep, by pre|venting the influx of the nervous fluid in|to the origin of the nerves, and con&s;e|quently by weakening the organic ela&s;ti|city of the fibres, as the preceding cau&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have many times experienced this after the ope|ration of the Trepan: the &s;light pre&s;&s;ure on the brain ever produced an ob&s;curity of &s;ight and a noi&s;e in the ears; a pre&s;&s;ure &s;omewhat more &s;trong was followed by drow&s;ine&s;s, and afterwards by perfect &s;leep; all the&s;e &s;ymptoms cea&s;ed upon di&s;continuing the pre&s;&s;ure.</NOTE>. But the mo&s;t conclu&s;ive rea&s;on is, that &s;leep cannot take place whil&s;t the body is violently agitated, either by a fever, or by any violent pa&s;&s;ion, equally capable of producing a ten&s;ion of the fibres.</P>
<P>If the relaxation of the fibres be the cau&s;e of &s;leep, the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of their organic ela&s;ticity by repo&s;e mu&s;t be the cau&s;e of waking. This cau&s;e, which
<PB N="201" REF="208">is nece&s;&s;arily deduced from the nature of things, I &s;hall demon&s;trate by its pheno|mena.</P>
<P>On the conclu&s;ion of undi&s;turbed &s;leep, the fibres in&s;en&s;ibly become more ten&s;e, the complexion more lively, the circula|tion more quick, the impre&s;&s;ions of ob|jects on the &s;en&s;es more &s;trong, and the &s;oul again communicates with external objects. When we have once fallen into a deep &s;leep, we are not awakened from it but by very lively &s;en&s;ations; but when the u&s;ual &s;pace of time allotted for re&s;t is nearly expired, the lea&s;t noi&s;e awakes us, and ever more ea&s;ily, the nearer we are to the hour of awaking: &s;o that the fir&s;t de|gree of &s;leep is &s;carcely to be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from waking, and its la&s;t degree is confounded therewith. Sleep, therefore, comes on and goes off by in&s;en&s;ible de|grees; &s;imilar, in this re&s;pect, to the ob|&s;curity of night, which gradually increa&s;es till it arrives at midnight darkne&s;s, and af|terwards decrea&s;es by the &s;ame gradation. Let us therefore conclude, that the fibres po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater degree of organic ela&s;ti|city in Man when awake than when a|&s;leep.
<PB N="202" REF="209">It is then obvious, that whil&s;t the fibres are relaxed, there is no regular &s;e|ries of thoughts; the mind pa&s;&s;es without any regularity over the &s;en&s;ations it has received, its thoughts &s;ucceed each other in confu&s;ion; and, if at any time they form a regular &s;eries, it is only whil&s;t the fibres are ten&s;e. In the agitations of a painful dream, the thoughts are &s;ome|what regular; but in the mean time, Man is greatly di&s;turbed, and, when he afterwards awakes, finds him&s;elf oppre&s;&s;ed with fatigue, and wet with &s;weat and tears.</P>
<P>Thus it is only by the relaxation of the organic ela&s;ticity of our fibres, that &s;leep interrupts the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our ideas; the order of our thoughts therefore depends on the &s;tate of the body.</P>
<P>I imagine, the proofs already offered in &s;upport of this will be found &s;atisfacto|rily conclu&s;ive; but that no proof may be wanting, and that the principle may be incontrovertibly e&s;tabli&s;hed, let us examine the &s;tate of the body relatively to the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of the ideas in madmen, tho&s;e liv|ing examples of the vagaries, or, if you will, of the rovings of this di&s;tempered &s;tate of human rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="210">There are many &s;pecies of madne&s;s, in every one of which the mind forms wrong judgments of things. In each &s;pe|cies of madne&s;s, &s;en&s;ations and ideas of every kind are produced, but have neither order nor connexion; and in this incohe|rent &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in this chaos of &s;en&s;ations and thoughts, the will acts not, but lets the images of things &s;ucceed each other in di&s;order. Attention not being &s;uffi|ciently &s;trong, the &s;oul is not con&s;cious of its thoughts; &s;o that illu&s;ion is often admitted among&s;t, and intimately con|nected with them.</P>
<P>This, however, may be ob&s;erved with re|&s;pect to the &s;everal &s;pecies of madne&s;s; that &s;tate of the &s;oul, which is accidental in the one, is natural and con&s;tant in the other &s;orts: but all equally re&s;ult from an ina|bility to attend; this inability I &s;hall de|mon&s;trate to be wholly dependent on the con&s;titution of the body.</P>
<P>Phy&s;iologi&s;ts have &s;ought in dead ani|mals the cau&s;es of this di&s;ordered &s;tate of the &s;oul in living animals, as if it proceeded from the unnatural confor|mation of &s;ome organ, which mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily

<P>By comparing the &s;tate of the body of one that died in perfect enjoyment of rea|&s;on, with that of one who died in a &s;tate of madne&s;s, we &s;hall undoubtedly di&s;co|ver many con&s;iderable differences; &s;uch as the di&s;ten&s;ion of the ve&s;&s;els of the <HI>me|ninges;</HI> the inflammation of the&s;e mem|branes; the extrava&s;ation of lymph into the <HI>&s;inu&s;es</HI> of the brain; the &s;iccity of this <HI>vi&s;cus,</HI> and of the origin of the nerves; appearances commonly &s;een in the bodies of the latter, but never in tho&s;e of the former. This difference, which is here &s;uppo&s;ed to be the cau&s;e, is only the ef|fect. Con&s;idered as the effect, it may conduct us to the knowledge of the true principle; but in our enquiries we &s;hall proceed with greater &s;ucce&s;s, by compar|ing
<PB N="205" REF="212">the &s;tate of the &s;olids of a man in perfect rea&s;on, with that of the &s;olids of one who has lo&s;t it.</P>
<P>The different &s;pecies of madne&s;s may be reduced to two; which are to be di&s;|tingui&s;hed not by tho&s;e vagaries of rea&s;on which are common to both, but by the character of the thoughts; they are de|&s;igned under two general denominations; furious madne&s;s, when the thoughts are daring, and the emotions of the &s;oul vehe|ment; <HI>in&s;anity</HI> or <HI>idioti&s;m,</HI> when the emo|tions of the &s;oul and the thoughts are weakly expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>There is a rigidity of the nervous &s;y&s;|tem, when the rovings of the &s;oul are at|tended with fury, as in frenzy, inflamma|tory fevers, drunkenne&s;s, and the hy&s;teric affection; there is a debilitation thereof, when the &s;ame rovings are indicated in a tranquil and languid manner, as in in&s;a|nity, dotage, and in that melancholy madne&s;s, which is occa&s;ioned by the u&s;e of narcotics. Every one may be convinced of this, by &s;imply in&s;pecting a body in the&s;e different &s;tates, and by examining the phenomena.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="213">With regard to that affection of the mind which is produced by drunkenne&s;s, it is obvious, that &s;pirituous liquors are peculiarly adapted to produce a rigidity in the fibres.</P>
<P>The &s;aline particles with which the&s;e liquors are impregnated, and the &s;pirits with which they abound, when received into the &s;tomach, fir&s;t irritate its mem|branes, and, being conveyed into the in|te&s;tines, irritate their coats: this irrita|tion is immediately followed by a &s;pa&s;m of the&s;e organs, propagated through|out the body, by the corre&s;pondence of the nervous &s;y&s;tem which affects every part, but more e&s;pecially the <HI>meninges.</HI></P>
<P>This violent ten&s;ion of the meninges is pre&s;ently after produced in a more direct manner: the &s;alts and the &s;pirits gradually pa&s;s into the fluids, and, being conveyed to the brain with the blood, increa&s;e the ten&s;ion of its membranes, and the circula|tion is rendered more impetuous. This violent &s;pa&s;m, at intervals, compre&s;&s;es the cavity of the nerves, and interrupts, in whole or in part, the perflux of their fluid:
<PB N="207" REF="214">hence proceed tho&s;e irregular and convul|&s;ive motions of the mu&s;cles, that &s;tagger|ing and total lo&s;s of &s;en&s;e and motion, ob&s;erved in per&s;ons who have died in a &s;tate of inebriation. By comparing the tone of the &s;olids of a drunkard, with that of the &s;olids of a temperate per&s;on, we find the fibres moderately ten&s;e in the latter, and extremely &s;o in the former. In drunk|enne&s;s, the countenance appears inflamed, the eyes red and fiery, the ve&s;&s;els of the face di&s;tended, the limbs at fir&s;t are flexi|ble, afterwards they are &s;tiff and con|vul&s;ed; the regularity of mu&s;cular motion is de&s;troyed, the body is un&s;table, the &s;en&s;es are dull, the &s;ight is troubled, and the objects looked upon &s;eem to waver. Here, if we may judge by the &s;en&s;es, is an ex|treme ten&s;ion of the fibres, which very nearly approaches to rigidity, and this ri|gidity is proved on the te&s;timony of facts.</P>

<PB N="212" REF="219">and ob&s;tructed circulation, occa&s;ioned by the &s;pa&s;m of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, and of the &s;olids in general. For when a part is affected with a &s;pa&s;m, the ve&s;&s;els of which it is compo&s;ed are violently contracted; and as the coats of the arteries are more &s;trong than tho&s;e of the veins, &s;o much the more they re&s;i&s;t their contraction; the blood continues to flow on to that part with ea&s;e, but in its return is ob|&s;tructed; whereby it accumulates in the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, and exce&s;&s;ively di&s;tends them: hence the&s;e inflammations, di&s;ten&s;ions and <HI>varices.</HI> When the di&s;ten&s;ion is extreme, the ve&s;&s;els permit their contained fluid to permeate their coats: hence tho&s;e extra|va&s;ations of the lymph, blood, and tho&s;e polypous excre&s;cences which proceed therefrom. Finally, if we ob&s;erve that cau&s;tic acrids, as the <HI>hyo&s;ciamum, &s;olanum verum,</HI> and generally every thing that ir|ritates the nerves and renders them rigid, either taken internally or applied outward|ly, produce the mo&s;t terrible delirium and madne&s;s; whil&s;t lenients and anti&s;pa&s;modic medicines re&s;tore rea&s;on, we &s;hall be con|vinced, that this perturbed &s;tate of the
<PB N="213" REF="220">mind is wholly produced by the &s;pa&s;m of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, but more e&s;pecially by that of the membranes of the brain. Hence it is evident, that furious madne&s;s proceeds from a rigidity of the fibres; I &s;hall now &s;hew that in&s;anity or idioti&s;m is occa&s;ioned by their relaxation.</P>
<P>In&s;anity often &s;ucceeds madne&s;s, and that in&s;tantaneou&s;ly; this phenomenon is very natural, as the violent ten&s;ion of the fibres mu&s;t be followed by their relaxation: when this debilitation is con&s;iderable, and the organic ela&s;ticity of the fibres is &s;o greatly impaired, that it requires &s;ome con&s;iderable time before it can be re&s;tored, the mind recovers not the tone adapted for rea&s;on; it only changes the &s;pecies of its folly. This is more particularly ob&s;erved in inflammatory fevers, where furious madne&s;s opens the di&s;ea&s;e, and idioti&s;m concludes it. Whil&s;t the nerves are con|vul&s;ed, and the circulation is vehement, Man acts with violence, his ideas are con|fu&s;ed, he lo&s;es all knowledge, and utters, with a furious a&s;pect, incoherent expre&s;|&s;ions: but when the morbid humours have taken another cour&s;e, when the black
<PB N="214" REF="221">poi&s;on which occa&s;ions his di&s;ea&s;e is di&s;|charged from his ve&s;&s;els; weakened by the violence his tran&s;ports, he remains a long time de&s;titute of &s;trength, de|prived of rea&s;on, in&s;en&s;ible either of the evil or danger of his condition, and is reduced to a &s;tate of infancy, which is of &s;o much the longer duration, andthe debi|litation of the ela&s;ticity of his fibres is more extreme; for in the&s;e ca&s;es the ef|fect is ever equal to the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>To the foregoing may be added the analogy between the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;oul and body during &s;leep, and the di&s;|po&s;ition of the&s;e two &s;ub&s;tances during in|&s;anity. For this &s;tate of the &s;oul, whil&s;t Man is awake, perfectly corre&s;ponds to that whil&s;t Man is a&s;leep; the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;en&s;ations is the &s;ame; the exerci&s;e of thinking, and the action of the organs are the &s;ame likewi&s;e; in both, the fibres are relaxed, and the circulation languid: whence it appears, that the&s;e two &s;tates have &s;imilar cau&s;es.</P>
<P>This kind of in&s;anity is oftentimes produced by exce&s;&s;ive &s;tudy, by violent pa&s;&s;ions, by a con&s;iderable lo&s;s of &s;emen,
<PB N="215" REF="222">and by every thing which debilitates the organic ela&s;ticity of the fibres. This is confirmed by comparative anatomy: for the &s;tate of dotage, that is, when the &s;en&s;ations and ideas are combined without order, is preci&s;ely the &s;ame as when the body is feeble, the &s;trength is exhau&s;ted, and the organs are inela&s;tic. It is there|fore obvious, that this alienation of mind is the effect of the extreme impairing of the organic ela&s;ticity of our &s;olids</P>
<P><HI>Furious madne&s;s proceeds from the rigidity of the fibres; idioti&s;m or in&s;anity from their relaxation; and the &s;late adapted for rea&s;on from their moderate ela&s;ticity:</HI> &s;uch are the &s;ecret cau&s;es of the order which obtains in our thoughts. Hence it appears, that a greater or le&s;s degree of ten&s;ion of the fibres can make a man either rational or in&s;ane. Rea&s;on and madne&s;s mu&s;t therefore depend on the mechani&s;m of the body, and not in the lea&s;t on the &s;oul, as philo|&s;ophers have fal&s;ely &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Having contemplated the&s;e rovings of the &s;oul, and di&s;covered their cau&s;es in the different tones of the fibres, let us proceed to a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;on of the&s;e phe|nomena.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="223">A regular &s;eries of thoughts ever re|quires, in order to its formation, that the mind be intent on the object of its judgments; this inten&s;ene&s;s of the mind is ever accompanied by that of the body. During meditation, the pul&s;e beats more &s;trongly than when we do not meditate, and &s;o much the more &s;trongly, as the &s;oul is the more deeply engaged in medita|tion. Thus in cataleptics, whil&s;t the &s;oul is involved in the mo&s;t profound re|flections, the blood circulates with greater freedom and force, the complexion be|comes more lively, re&s;piration more free, and every function of the body is more perfectly performed. During meditation the whole body is violently ten&s;e, but par|ticularly the <HI>plexus nervo&s;i,</HI> and the mem|branes of the brain.</P>
<P>Too great or too long application in|crea&s;es this ten&s;ion, even &s;o far as to ex|cite a &s;tupor in the head, and kindle up a fever in the veins: &s;tudious per&s;ons fre|quently experience this, I my&s;elf have, many times.</P>
<P>The &s;oul, during meditation, not only af|fects the body with a degree of ten&s;ion, but
<PB N="217" REF="224">without its concurrence cannot operate alone. In chronic di&s;ea&s;es, during a &s;tate of convale&s;cence, and after a con&s;iderable lo&s;s of &s;emen, we can neither reflect nor meditate, whatever efforts we make; we think very little, and our ideas are vague and unconnected. Even immediately af|ter profound meditation, the mind being fatigued, indulges it&s;elf in roving, al|though the will oppo&s;e; we indeed con|tinue to think, but our thoughts are alto|gether irregular; we remain awake, but experience the effects of &s;leep; imagina|tion traces the &s;ame airy &s;emblances, the &s;ame fugitive &s;hades as during &s;leep.</P>
<P>No regular &s;eries of thoughts can be formed without a ten&s;ion of the fibres: this ten&s;ion has fixed bounds, determined limits, beyond which the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our ideas cannot proceed. When the fibres are too ten&s;e, as in drunkenne&s;s, in fevers, and in violent head aches, let us ever &s;o much attempt to reflect, all our efforts are vain, the &s;oul is either in a <HI>delirium</HI> or in a <HI>&s;tupor.</HI> It has been proved, that in regular thought the under&s;tanding<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book II. Art. Exerci&s;e of the under&s;tanding.</NOTE> is &s;ub|ject
<PB N="218" REF="225">to the will; that this exerci&s;e of rea|&s;on requires a certain tone of the &s;olids; and that the tone of the &s;olids nece&s;&s;ary to rea&s;on has a certain extent: this tone, therefore, mu&s;t be con&s;tantly exi&s;tent in Man, whil&s;t his organs are obedient to the will; but is not found either in a &s;tate of rigidity or relaxation, two &s;tates of the fibres which have this in common, that they both equally free the body from &s;ubjection to the will.</P>
<P>If we notice the power which certain aliments, fruits, and liquors have on the body, we &s;hall be convinced that it is &s;u|perior, or at lea&s;t equal to that of the &s;oul over the material &s;ub&s;tance to which it is united. Again, if we compare the empire of the different faculties of the &s;oul over the body, we &s;hall be convin|ced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book III. Ob&s;. 62.</NOTE>, that the power of &s;en&s;ibility is much greater than that of the will, and incomparably more &s;o than that of the un|der&s;tanding or imagination. That of &s;en|&s;ibility and imagination is univer&s;al; that is, it influences both the mu&s;cular fibres and their <HI>fibrillae,</HI> the organs of &s;en&s;e and
<PB N="219" REF="226">motion; whil&s;t that of the will is re&s;train|ed to the latter of the&s;e only. But none of the&s;e faculties has any power over the body, but by the nervous fluid; when this is deficient, or when it has lo&s;t its energy, or even when the ela&s;ticity of the fibres is impaired, it is obvious, that the power of the will is at an end. Even when this fluid is violently impelled into the mu&s;cular fibres, either by &s;en&s;ibilty or by &s;ome other cau&s;e, with greater im|petuo&s;ity than the will can impel it; it is evident, that the rigidity is not removed, but confirmed thereby, if it proceed from a violent influx of the nervous fluid into the fibres.</P>
<P>Hence the rea&s;on why the violent pa&s;&s;i|ons, as rage, fear, terror, affect us with a kind of momentary madne&s;s; why the efforts we make to reflect, when fatigued by meditation, only &s;erve to increa&s;e our inability to think; in a word, why the rigidity and total relaxation of the &s;olids deprive the &s;oul of the free exerci&s;e of its faculties, and are the cau&s;es of madne&s;s, the degree and force whereof is proportioned to that of their principle.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="227">Let us therefore conclude, that <HI>as the mind cannot act alone, it ever requires the concurrence of the corporeal organs to reflect and meditate, and that the unfolding of its faculties entirely depends upon organzation.</HI></P>
<P>I have now only to offer a few ob&s;erva|tions on the &s;ub&s;equent phenomena, to confirm what has been &s;aid on the &s;ame &s;ubject el&s;ewhere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book II. Art. Some &s;ingular phenomena ex|plained, concerning the effects of the pa&s;&s;ions on the under&s;tanding.</NOTE>. Certain hypochon|driacs &s;ee vi&s;ions at mid-day, and with their eyes open: &s;ome fancy they behold a continued &s;eries of phantoms and hide|ous &s;pectres, rapidly &s;ucceeding each other; others, a &s;eries of agreeable objects, flit|ting &s;hades, female forms, magnificent &s;cenes, which offer them&s;elves in &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, and are &s;een like objects really ex|i&s;ting; &s;o that the deception of the&s;e vi|&s;ionary repre&s;entations is &s;o &s;trong, that they believe them to be realities.</P>
<P>When &s;peaking of the colourings which the &s;entiments of the &s;oul communicate to objects, and of the illu&s;ions of the pa&s;&s;i|ons
<PB N="221" REF="228">analogous to the facts related above, I ob&s;erved, that phy&s;iologi&s;ts had attributed the&s;e phenomena to the nervous fluid; and that, to account for it, they had imagin|ed, <Q>that this fluid, which is naturally &s;ubject to the empire of the &s;oul, be|comes its &s;uperior in the&s;e affections; that in the organ of &s;ight particularly, it a&s;&s;umes every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive modification repre&s;entative of objects, which had before affected it.</Q> I demon&s;trated, that phy&s;iologi&s;ts improperly confound the operations of the &s;en&s;es with tho&s;e of the mind; I likewi&s;e proved this phenome|non to be very &s;imple, and only my&s;terious from our mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of it. I ob|&s;erve now, as I did then, that the&s;e vi&s;ions of hypochondriacs are only &s;en&s;ations re|newed from the memory, the empty phan|toms of a &s;oul violently agitated, wholly engro&s;&s;ed and mi&s;led by its plea&s;ures or its pains, and unable to return within it|&s;elf to examine objects.</P>
<P>I have already proved, that the &s;oul, when &s;trongly affected by any object, is blind to every other, it being no longer able to attend thereto; I &s;hall now offer a phy&s;ical rea&s;on of this phenomenon.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="229">It is only by attention, that we can di&s;|tingui&s;h in the &s;oul the real impre&s;&s;ions of things from &s;en&s;ations re-produced. Be|&s;ides, the pre&s;ence of mind nece&s;&s;ary to reflection, requires in the fibres a certain de|gree of ten&s;ion, the <HI>medium</HI> between rigi|dity and relaxation. In inflammatory fe|vers, and in the hypochondriac di&s;ea&s;e, there is the &s;ame rigidity as in the inflam|mation of the &s;tomach, contracted by the u&s;e of &s;ome acrid aliment, or by poi&s;on: for the irritation of this <HI>vi&s;cus</HI> affects the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem, and more e&s;pecially the membranes of the brain. In all the&s;e ca&s;es, rea&s;on is extinct; for the will has no longer any power over the organs, as has been already &s;hewn. Thus, aban|doned to it&s;elf, the mind employs it&s;elf in reviewing the objects which formerly af|fected it; but wanting the attention ne|ce&s;&s;ary to di&s;cern whether their image be re-produced or not, it mi&s;takenly imagines them pre&s;ent, and really exi&s;ting.</P>
<P>When the &s;pa&s;m cea&s;es, the mind in|&s;tantly recovers its rea&s;on, the&s;e imaginary objects di&s;appear, the deception cea&s;es, the patient finds him&s;elf in his chamber,
<PB N="223" REF="230">&s;urrounded by his di&s;con&s;olate friends, and relates to them the &s;ubject of his vi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The &s;ame effects which are produced by acrid humours on the body in &s;evers, and by irritating aliments in the inflammation of the &s;tomach, are likewi&s;e produced by an inflamed imagination, and by violent pa&s;&s;ions; examples, which confirm this, daily occur to our ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>When the &s;oul is engro&s;&s;ed by any vio|lent pa&s;&s;ion, when the imagination forms a lively picture of the charms of a favou|rite object, repre&s;ents it as the idol of the heart, adorns it with every attractive grace, and &s;uffers it to make a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the mind; by degrees the charms, in which we have cloathed and decked it, dazzle the &s;ight, and impo&s;e even on our|&s;elves: then wholly engaged thereby, we are in&s;en&s;ible to every other object, and mi&s;led fo the&s;e phantoms, we take our vi&s;ions for realities.</P>
<P>Thus, in the extreme anxieties of a &s;oul tormented by remor&s;e, the guilty wretch continually revolves in his mind every crime he has committed, and re|mains a mi&s;erable victim to de&s;pair. Should
<PB N="224" REF="231">&s;leep clo&s;e his eyes; his &s;leep is only a frightful <HI>delirium,</HI> the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his crimes preys upon his heart, and terrifies him with horrid vi&s;ions. He dreams he hears the groans of tho&s;e he has de|&s;troyed, thinks he &s;ees their gho&s;ts ri&s;ing from their tombs, and imprecating the ju&s;tice of heaven on him; the darkne&s;s of hell covers the face of the earth, the furies hi&s;s in his ears, &s;hake their torches at him, and pur&s;ue and haunt him wherever he goes; devils, fiends, every moniter in fable be&s;et his &s;oul; harra&s;&s;ed with the&s;e horrible vi&s;ions, the wretch awakes in affright, vents loud cries, &s;tarts back with horror at the ap|proach of his friends, whom now he knows not, and cla&s;ps the next thing he finds in his arms, and fancies he clings to the altar.</P>
<P>Thus it is that the pa&s;&s;ions produce vi&s;i|ons and trances; thus it is that enthu&s;ia&s;m is changed into a delirium, and thus it is that fanatic minds &s;ometimes fancy them|&s;elves in&s;pired.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our ideas, and the order which obtains in our
<PB N="225" REF="232">thoughts, recalls me to the point from whence I fir&s;t &s;et out. I then proved that the depth, the ju&s;tne&s;s and &s;ublimity of ideas, required fibres &s;trong and greatly ela&s;tic, and that the&s;e characters of our ideas varied together with the organization: but the different degrees of the &s;trength and ela&s;ticity of the&s;e organs in different individuals, which at fir&s;t appeared of &s;o little con&s;equence, produce other very &s;urpri&s;ing effects. This principle, &s;imple as it is, abounds in con&s;equences; it is this which enables us to di&s;cover truths, hitherto concealed from the learned, and involved in profound darkne&s;s. Let us endeavour to draw from this hidden &s;ource &s;ome additional knowledge, which may throw light on &s;ome very ob&s;cure &s;ubjects, and &s;catter flowers over the thorny paths of philo&s;ophy.</P>

<HEAD>Organization renders Imagination the predo|minant Character of the <HI>MIND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The exerci&s;e of regular thought is to the mind, what voluntary motion is to the body; that is, a &s;tate of con&s;traint which
<PB N="226" REF="233">the &s;oul commonly yields to with reluc|tance, and ever endures with pain.</P>
<P>If we follow the mind in its operations, we &s;hall ob&s;erve, that when abandoned to its own activity, it acts without rule and without method; it never acts with order, but when nece&s;&s;ity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book II. Art. Regular thought con&s;idered re|latively to the degree of attention which it requires.</NOTE> obliges it thereto, and returns to its former &s;tate immediately, when freed from re&s;traint. What renders the regular exerci&s;e of thought more fatiguing than the irregular, is the attention which it requires; the dif|ficulty of fixing objects in the mind, in order to con&s;ider them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE> without di&s;trac|tion, and the efforts which are nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cern their different relations; efforts &s;o much the more painful as the objects happen to be naturally volatile, and fall not within the cognizance of the &s;en&s;es. But what renders the&s;e efforts painful, is that ten&s;ion of the fibres which this in|ten&s;ene&s;s of the mind requires; for the ten&s;ion of the fibres ever produces in the &s;oul an unplea&s;ing &s;entiment more or le&s;s
<PB N="227" REF="234">&s;trong, but ever proportionate to its force. We mu&s;t therefore con&s;tantly recur to phy|&s;ical cau&s;es, to account for the&s;e phenomena of the mind.</P>
<P>By following the mind in its operations, it is ea&s;y to di&s;cover, that when it cea&s;es to con&s;ider objects attentively, it no longer judges of their true relations; in this ca&s;e thought becomes imagination. Thus, of all the &s;ciences, geometry requires the lea&s;t aid from imagination, as it continually fixes the attention on one particular ob|ject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not that he who di&s;covers a demon&s;tration has no occa&s;ion for invention; but that the demon&s;tra|tion being once di&s;covered, others have only to pur&s;ue it: only the inventor of a &s;cience has occa&s;ion to rea|&s;on; tho&s;e who &s;ucceed him have no more to do than to repeat his rea&s;onings.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have demon&s;trated, that regular thought fatigues the mind much more<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Book II. Art. Regular thought con&s;idered re|latively to the degrees of attention which it requires.</NOTE>, and much &s;ooner than revery; I have likewi&s;e &s;hewn, that when the mind is fatigued, it no longer fixes upon any object, and cea&s;es to con&s;ider attentively<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Book III.

Whence let us conclude, that a <HI>&s;oul united to a delicate and feeble body mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s more imagination than judgment.</HI></P>
<P>The tran&s;ition from rea&s;on to imagina|tion is very ea&s;y. If the mind, during reflection, be di&s;tracted by any &s;en&s;ation, it lo&s;es &s;ight of its objects, is engaged by &s;ome analogous relation, and wanders from one to another, till it entirely lo&s;es its fir&s;t engagement; it at length perceives it&s;elf bewildered in the labyrinths of imagination, even whil&s;t it fancies it|&s;elf attentively pur&s;uing its former re|flections. The greater the &s;en&s;ibility, the more difficult it is to prevent the&s;e wanderings: <HI>whence it follows, that the Man who&s;e organs are delicate and greatly &s;en&s;ible mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s more imagination than judgment.</HI></P>
<P>If the tran&s;ition from rea&s;on to imagi|nation be very ea&s;y, it is likewi&s;e very
<PB N="229" REF="236">natural. Whatever our thoughts may be' &s;ome &s;ecret attractive, &s;ome hidden charm, recalls the mind to its favourite &s;ubject. The &s;oul, ever delighted with plea&s;ing &s;entiments, re&s;igns it&s;elf wholly thereto, and its natural love of happine&s;s prompts it to perpetuate the plea&s;ure it takes there|in. The mind thus reli&s;hing tho&s;e plea&s;ures, wi&s;hes to increa&s;e them; where|fore it &s;ucce&s;&s;ively occupies it&s;elf in exa|mining, one after another, all the agreea|ble objects which are in any way connec|ted with tho&s;e which affect it with de|light, and thus thought becomes imagi|nation.

<P>And as the &s;oul ever perceives the di&s;|po&s;ition of the body during &s;leep, although it appears to be then freed from its &s;ub|jection to the &s;en&s;es; the &s;ame analogy mu&s;t be ob&s;erved in man a&s;leep, as when awake. Hence the rea&s;on why the nature of dreams is ever analogous to the &s;tate of the body, and to the &s;en&s;ation then af|fecting the mind.

<P>What has been &s;aid above concerning the imagination, is properly applicable to irregular thought only; its regular pro|ductions require the &s;ame phy&s;ical di&s;po|&s;ition which rea&s;on does.</P>

<P>Neverthele&s;s, if regular imagination re|quires the ela&s;ticity of our organs, it re|quires it in a le&s;s degree than rea&s;on; for its objects are neither nece&s;&s;arily depen|dant on each other, nor clo&s;ely connected its productions are only detached parts, where the mind has nothing to do but to weave them into one ti&s;&s;ue. Finally, be|cau&s;e their connection depends not on the combination of a great number of thoughts or ideas which are naturally profound and difficult to be inve&s;tigated, as tho&s;e of rea&s;on commonly are; a &s;ingle &s;troke of the pencil &s;hall frequently &s;erve to con|nect the parts of which the group is to be
<PB N="233" REF="240">compo&s;ed. And although regular imagi|nation may be a &s;tate of con&s;traint like rea&s;on, it neverthele&s;s fatigues the &s;oul much le&s;s; for imagination has ever the choice of its &s;ubjects, and this choice is ever directed towards agreeable objects; whil&s;t rea&s;on, ever tied down to follow nature, mu&s;t needs frequently find an irk&s;omene&s;s from painful re&s;earches and dry reflections, and is ever bu&s;ied in a di&s;gu&s;tful employ|ment.

<P><HI>Imagination requires le&s;s force of the or|gans than rea&s;on, but a greater &s;hare of organic ela&s;ticity of the fibres, or rather a greater &s;hare of &s;en&s;ibility.</HI> For it is not always by a careful examination of ob|jects, nor by a &s;eries of many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive combinations, that the imagination forms new productions: the mo&s;t happy &s;trokes of fancy often pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the mind &s;pontaneou&s;ly, when we lea&s;t think, and are never the fruit of pains or plod|ding. It is therefore only by vaiou&s;ly combining objects, by leaving (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) the mind to
<PB N="234" REF="241">rove at will, and by employing no more attention than is nece&s;&s;ary to collect the re&s;ult of its thoughts, and to &s;e|lect therefrom &s;uch as are for its pur|po&s;e. The greater our &s;en&s;ibility, the more liable we are to di&s;traction, the more affected by analogies, the le&s;s at|tached to material objects, and the more capable of tho&s;e happy, but fortuitous combinations, the true &s;ource of inge|nious &s;allies, and of the noble&s;t produc|tions of the human mind.</P>
<P>Thus therefore men who have but lit|tle &s;en&s;ibility, and are of robu&s;t organs, can po&s;&s;e&s;s but a &s;mall &s;hare of imagina|tion: men, who are but little &s;en&s;ible, and yet delicate, mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s more.

<P>Finally, in the hi&s;tory of the academy of &s;ciences of Paris, Ann&eacute;e 1701, pag. 57. we find the ca&s;e of a child, eight years of age, that lo&s;t its<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Even here remembrance and recollection are &s;ig|nified, as I ob&s;erved above, although the term memory be made u&s;e of.</NOTE> memory by the ex|ce&s;&s;ive heats of &s;ummer, and never reco|vered it whil&s;t the heats continued.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="244">Since the influence of the body on the &s;oul has fixed and con&s;tant relations, the de|cay and lo&s;s of remembrance or recollection are therefore produced by cau&s;es common to every in&s;tance abovementioned. By what the&s;e ca&s;es have in common, it clearly ap|pears, that the cau&s;e of this decay, and lo&s;s of the&s;e powers, is only the diminu|tion of the organic ela&s;ticity of the ner|vous &s;y&s;tem, but more e&s;pecially of the membranes of the brain; a diminution common to every &s;ubject here noticed, but produced in different ways. In the one, by a defect of the nervous fluid, as in <HI>microcephali,</HI> and tho&s;e who have been ex|hau&s;ted by immoderate coition: in others, by a violent ten&s;ion of the fibres, as in apoplectics, tho&s;e who have been recalled to life after hanging, and tho&s;e who have under gone the operation of the trepan: in others, by the&s;e two cau&s;es united, as in per&s;ons affected with acute or chronic di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>We &s;hall be fully convinced of this truth, if we con&s;ider, that every thing which im|pairs the tone of the &s;olids, either by vi|tiating the &s;ecretion of the nervous fluid in the brain, or re&s;training its action, pro|duces
<PB N="238" REF="245">the &s;ame effect. The immoderate u&s;e of cooling liquors, &s;pirits, <HI>opium, hy|o&s;ciamum,</HI> and other narcotics, long and profound &s;adne&s;s, fear, terror, and every other violent pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul, too long continued watching, and too profound me|ditation, all which are adapted to de&s;troy the ela&s;ticity of the fibres, occa&s;ion the lo&s;s of remembrance and recollection. Fi|nally, the decay, and even the lo&s;s of the&s;e powers, are often occa&s;ioned by ex|ce&s;&s;ive heat; in this ca&s;e, it is vi&s;ibly pro|duced by the diminution of organic ela&s;ti|city. Every thing concurs to e&s;tabli&s;h the lo&s;s of ela&s;ticity, as the cau&s;e of this phe|nomenon, as I have ob&s;erved, in collect|ing the different ob&s;ervations made upon this &s;ubject, and reducing to fixed points their numerous variations.</P>
<P>If more proofs were required, I would here repeat what has been &s;aid el&s;ewhere concerning the order of our thoughts. On the approach of &s;leep, and at the clo&s;e of weari&s;ome meditation, when the fibres relax and the circulation is languid, when the &s;en&s;es are inactive and every organ is at re&s;t, the &s;oul appears to be then detached from the body, and wanders without any
<PB N="239" REF="246">&s;cope; remembrance is lo&s;t, we recollect nothing, not even things which are the mo&s;t familiar. When &s;leep clo&s;es the eyes, objects which affect us whil&s;t awake are retraced in the mind, but the mind remembers them not, and this forgetful|ne&s;s is &s;o much the more extreme as the &s;leep is more profound, that is, as the fi|bres are more relaxed; the mind recovers not the&s;e powers, till the ela&s;ticity of the fibres is re-e&s;tabli&s;hed by repo&s;e.</P>
<P>But if the lo&s;s of remembrance and re|collection be often produced by the relax|ation of the fibres; it is &s;ometimes occa&s;i|oned by their rigidity. In inflammatory fevers, in drunkenne&s;s, nothing is remem|bered, nothing recollected. How fre|quently are &s;een per&s;ons when affected with either of the&s;e, that know not their friends, children, wives, and even forget their own name! How many have been reduced to the &s;ame mi&s;erable &s;tate from the irritation of the meninges by &s;plinters of the <HI>crani|um,</HI> or by &s;ome extraneous body!</P>
<P><HI>Remembrance and recollection, therefore, require a moderate degree of ten&s;ion of the fibres, as does the regular exerci&s;e of thought.</HI>
<PB N="240" REF="247">The rea&s;on of this phenomenon is ea&s;ily comprehended. Memory is a pa&s;&s;ive fa|culty; but remembrance and recollection are the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book II. Art. Of recollection and remem|brance.</NOTE> re&s;ults of our &s;everal intellectual faculties combined. The one is the &s;tate of reflecting on the &s;en&s;ations and the ideas depo&s;ited in the memory: the other is a &s;tate of inten&s;ene&s;s, by which the &s;oul forces it&s;elf to recall the&s;e &s;en&s;ations and the&s;e ideas. Remembrance and recollec|tion therefore of nece&s;&s;ity require atten|tion, and con&s;equently a moderate degree of organic ela&s;ticity in the fibres. It is therefore obvious, that when the &s;ubjects of our ob&s;ervations have not the power of rendering the fibres ten&s;e, the mind is de|void of the&s;e powers.</P>
<P>Hence we mu&s;t conclude, that remem|brance and recollection are determined by the tone of the &s;olids, and even depend on organization.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have &s;hown how the differ|ent degrees of the ela&s;ticity of the fibres contribute to the diver&s;ity of minds, and

<P><HI>Penetration depends on the number of the &s;en&s;es, and their good organization;</HI> but de|pends not wholly thereon. To di&s;cover the relations of things, it is not &s;ufficient to have a great number of &s;en&s;ations, there is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary the power of calling them to mind when occa&s;ion requires. With|out this faculty, the &s;en&s;ations depo&s;ited in the memory would be u&s;ele&s;s; without it, the mind could compare its pre&s;ent &s;en&s;a|tions only, all its judgments would be de|termined by the &s;en&s;es, and Man no longer act as Man, but as the mo&s;t &s;tupid of bea&s;ts. Be&s;ides, the number of the &s;en&s;es and their good organization, <HI>penetration likewi&s;e requires the &s;ame ela&s;ticity and force in the fibres as recollection.</HI></P>
<P>But even this will not &s;uffice. To di&s;|cover the relations of things, the mind mu&s;t compare them in their different a&s;|pects, and variou&s;ly combine them. Ex|cept this, admitting every other qualifica|tion, the be&s;t organized &s;en&s;es, the mo&s;t
<PB N="243" REF="250">ardent de&s;ire of attaining perfection; yet &s;o long as Man continues unable to com|bine his &s;en&s;ations, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for him to acquire knowledge. <HI>Penetra|tion therefore requires the &s;ame organic ela&s;|ticity of the fibres as reflection.</HI></P>
<P>Every man has a certain number of &s;en&s;ations, but all men have not equally the power of recalling, comparing, com|bining, and arranging them; qualities in|di&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to the di&s;covery of concealed relations. The&s;e qualities idiots have not; and this inability to recollect or reflect, is to be wholly attributed to the &s;tate of their organs.</P>
<P>If we compare the body of an idiot with the body of a rational per&s;on, we &s;hall find many con&s;iderable diver&s;ities between them. The mo&s;t con&s;picuous is the &s;mall dimen&s;ions of the <HI>cerebrum. Microcephali</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book III. Ob&s;. 15, 16.</NOTE> are idiots by nature; they have neither conception nor judgment: on the contra|ry, <HI>macrocephali</HI> are very ingenious.</P>
<P>Another difference is the bulk of the body, in compari&s;on of the &s;ize of the
<PB N="244" REF="251">head. Extremely large and fat per&s;ons, are commonly but a &s;mall remove from &s;tupidity; whil&s;t &s;mall and lean per&s;ons are generally the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>But all idiots are not &s;o by nature; &s;ome gradually arrive at that &s;tate, the mo&s;t in|genious equally with others. Acute di&s;|ea&s;es of long continuance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book III. Ob&s;. 12.</NOTE>, and likewi&s;e chronic di&s;ea&s;es, impair the penetration. The con&s;iderable lo&s;s of nervous fluid, ei|ther by coition, by its di&s;charge from the tumor of the <HI>hernia &s;pinalis,</HI> or by exten|&s;ive exerci&s;e, produces the &s;ame effects. Great drinkers, apoplectics, they who have undergone the operation of the tre|pan, they who have been recovered after hanging, remain very long without con|ception and without judgment.</P>
<P>Let us attend to the rea&s;on of the&s;e phe|nomena.</P>
<P><HI>Microcephali</HI> are idiots, <HI>macrocephali</HI> ve|ry &s;agacious. But if penetration be ever proportionate to the dimen&s;ions of the brain, it is not from any particular orga|nization of this <HI>vi&s;cus,</HI> as &s;ome have ima|gined.
<PB N="245" REF="252">The brain is only an organ of &s;e|cretion, and is without relation to the &s;oul, except by its &s;ecreting a greater or le&s;s quantity of the nervous fluid; and as its volume might more or le&s;s ob&s;truct the ori|gin of the nerves, by compre&s;&s;ing the mem|branes which &s;urround it; it is only in the&s;e re&s;pects, that the brain can influence penetration.</P>
<P>It has been already &s;hewn, that the ex|erci&s;e of regular thought, &s;uch as is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to penetration, requires a ten&s;ion of the fibres, particularly of tho&s;e of the <HI>meninges.</HI> This ten&s;ion, this augmenta|tion of the organic ela&s;ticity of the &s;olids, ari&s;es from the immediate influx of the nervous fluid impelled into the&s;e organs by the will. The more this fluid, &s;o im|mediately &s;ubject to the &s;oul in voluntary motion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book I. Art. Of the different motions of the body.</NOTE>, abounds, the more &s;trongly Man can apply his mind to reflection, and the longer continue it: for the power of the will on our organs, never prevails &s;o far as to render them rigid. Hence it is
<PB N="246" REF="253">evident, that <HI>microcephali,</HI> who are not abundantly &s;upplied therewith, mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be &s;tupid; and that <HI>macrocephali,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;s it in great abundance, mu&s;t be perfectly the rever&s;e. Hence it is, that large and very fat per&s;ons have in general but little &s;agacity; for the bulk of the body continually increa&s;es, and the &s;ize of the brain continues the &s;ame. This enor|mous bulk of body, compared to the di|men&s;ion of the brain, places them in the &s;ame cla&s;s with <HI>microcephali.</HI></P>
<P>This inability in <HI>microcephali,</HI> and in tho&s;e who are extremely fat, to increa&s;e the organic ela&s;ticity of their fibres, often de&s;troys the penetration of the mo&s;t &s;aga|cious. To this is owing that &s;tupidity which affects tho&s;e who have been reco|vered after hanging, apoplectics, tho&s;e who have &s;uffered the operation of the trepan, and hard drinkers. It is this, like|wi&s;e, which, after acute and chronic di&s;|ea&s;es, deprives men of the faculty of con|ception, and reduces them to a &s;tate of infancy.</P>
<P>Hence is the rea&s;on that, when an in|flammatory fever has con&s;umed the ner|vous
<PB N="247" REF="254">fluid, and fatigued our organs by vio|lent and precipitate motions, the mind is affected with a &s;tupor, all its faculties are di&s;ordered, and all knowledge lo&s;t: this returns not, but in proportion as the body acquires &s;trength, and arrives not to its former perfect &s;tate, till the body has en|tirely recovered its former vigour.</P>
<P>Hence the rea&s;on why the violent pa&s;&s;i|ons, profound &s;adne&s;s, and narcotics, pro|duce a kind of momentary &s;tupidity.</P>
<P>Hence the rea&s;on why &s;ome per&s;ons have become &s;tupid, by imitating too affi|diou&s;ly the ge&s;tures of folly.</P>

<P>Sagacity con&s;i&s;ts in readily di&s;covering remote relations. Thus, be&s;ides the num|ber and order of our &s;en&s;ations and ideas nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cover tho&s;e relations, it re|quires quick apprehen&s;ion; hence, not only the &s;ame phy&s;ical di&s;po&s;ition is ne|ce&s;&s;ary as in penetration, that is, force and organic ela&s;ticity of the fibres, but al|&s;o the mo&s;t perfect degree of this ela&s;tici|ty, or which is the &s;ame thing, that degree which is be&s;t adapted to &s;econd the acti|vity of the will: for the exerci&s;e of the under&s;tanding in penetration is voluntary. The regular exerci&s;e of thought, requires a certain organic tone of the fibres; but this tone is not limited to one particular point, it has a certain extent contained
<PB N="249" REF="256">between the oppo&s;ite extremes of relaxa|tion and rigidity. Madne&s;s and &s;tupidity are produced by the extremes, wi&s;dom holds the middle &s;tation, and its various degrees occupy the whole interval between them: there are therefore different de|grees in this intermediate &s;pace, in every one of which the &s;oul may po&s;&s;e&s;s pene|tration.

<PB N="250" REF="257">Sagacity therefore falls to the lot of tho&s;e who are endued both with vigour and &s;en|&s;ibility.

<P>In proportion as this <HI>equilibrium</HI> between the&s;e two powers is de&s;troyed, the mind nece&s;&s;arily lo&s;es its &s;agacity; but in a diffe|rent manner; if the balance be in favour of the &s;olids, if the fibres be either too lax or too rigid, the mind is le&s;s apt to recall the &s;en&s;ations and ideas depo&s;ited in the memory, or to compare them, and le&s;s readily di&s;covers their remote relations.

<P>But when this <HI>equilibrium</HI> between the fibres and nervous fluid, which forms Man's di&s;po&s;ition to &s;agacity, is de&s;troyed, and the &s;cale inclines to the latter, vivacity of mind becomes volatility. The &s;oul being then &s;trongly affected by the mo&s;t minute<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book I. Art.

Why the character of the &s;oul is ever congruous to the &s;tate of the body.</NOTE> on the body with a force proportionate thereto, communicates to this fluid a very &s;trong impul&s;e which, acting upon weak fibres, renders them rigid, and de&s;troys &s;agacity, together with the free exerci&s;e of the un|der&s;tanding.</P>
<P>To this &s;en&s;ibility add the delicacy, which is in&s;eparable from it, and which ren|ders us incapable of &s;u&s;taining for any long
<PB N="252" REF="259">time that laborious attention, which is often nece&s;&s;ary to the di&s;covery of remote relations. Thus too ha&s;ty in pronouncing on the relations of things, the mind al|ways falls &s;hort of the end which it de|&s;ires to attain, forms forced rea&s;onings, and continues for ever ignorant.</P>
<P>The ideas, to be ju&s;t, mu&s;t be di&s;tinct, al|though the&s;e qualities are not in&s;eparable. Thus in every ca&s;e where ju&s;tne&s;s of our ideas requires them to be numerous, the mind, if united to a body of very deli|cate texture and extreme &s;en&s;ibility, can &s;carce conceive any thing di&s;tinctly. In a man &s;o circum&s;tanced, the mind has not time to examine throughly any of the objects as they offer: they &s;hift &s;o fa&s;t, that he has hardly time to perceive them.</P>
<P>Hence the mind can have only imper|fect notions of things, and all its know|ledge is but a confu&s;ed huddle of errors and ab&s;urdities.</P>

<HEAD>Why <HI>MAN</HI> appears to lo&s;e &s;ome of his mental Faculties without lo&s;ing the others.</HEAD>
<P>Some men lo&s;e the power of meditat|ing, yet retain their other faculties. Some lo&s;e remembrance, imagination, the power of reflection, yet retain that of recollec|tion and judgment: &s;ome forget one kind
<PB N="255" REF="262">of ideas, one &s;ort of knowledge, without prejudice to others: in a word, &s;ome &s;eem to lo&s;e every mental power, in&s;tinct ex|cepted.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t celebrated philo&s;ophers, to ac|count for the&s;e phenomena, have imagin|ed a &s;y&s;tem, plau&s;ible at fir&s;t &s;ight, but in reality exceedingly ab&s;urd. They have fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed, contrary to truth, that each faculty of the &s;oul has &s;ome particular or|gan for its &s;eat, entirely disjoined from, and without relation to the others. They have afterwards laid it down as a maxim, that, when one of the&s;e organs is vitiated, the faculty re&s;ident therein is depraved likewi&s;e. Finally, to make this &s;y&s;tem quadrate with facts, they have concluded, that in the general di&s;arrangement of the machine, every part of which is intimate|ly connected, the&s;e different organs, &s;eats of the different faculties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Phy&s;iology of Le Cat, tome I. page 221. Paris edition.</NOTE> are not all af|fected at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>To elucidate the&s;e phenomena, I &s;hall not undertake a my&s;terious explanation,
<PB N="256" REF="263">which &s;uppo&s;es us to be endowed with know|ledge which we have not; nor imitate the explanations of others, which are equally repugnant to rea&s;on and experience. All the&s;e phenomena, which appear &s;o whim|&s;ical, and &s;o impo&s;&s;ible to account for, ac|cording to the &s;y&s;tem of the&s;e philo&s;o|phers, are &s;o very &s;imple, according to that which is here e&s;tabli&s;hed, that the only thing to be wondered at is their &s;implicity. We have &s;een that rea&s;on, imagination, re|membrance, recollection, penetration, &s;a|gacity, &amp;c. are powers of the mind, de|pendent on the different tones of the or|ganic ela&s;ticity of the fibres. It is there|fore evident, that the&s;e effects mu&s;t di&s;|appear with their cau&s;es. I &s;hall attempt farther to develope this principle, and give it the cleare&s;t evidence of truth.</P>
<P>The&s;e faculties of the &s;oul, viz. &s;en&s;i|bility, will, memory, and under&s;tanding, have different functions, as has been al|ready proved; but the&s;e faculties unite and combine in many different manners: from the&s;e their combinations re&s;ult thought, and the different operations of the mind. But unle&s;s they act conjunct|ly,
<PB N="257" REF="264">Man has neither &s;entiments nor ideas; their &s;eparation de&s;troys every operation of the mind, and, in appearance, annihilates the faculties them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Although the&s;e different faculties mutu|ally combine, they however combine not all in the &s;ame act: according as their combination varies, &s;o much the more different are their re&s;ults. Be&s;ides, though our intellectual faculties are the &s;ole prin|ciples of the operations of the &s;oul, and although &s;ome are active of them&s;elves, their exerci&s;e is neverthele&s;s entirely de|pendent on the body. The mind cannot proceed alone: it ever requires a certain degree of organic ela&s;ticity in the fibres, to think, reflect, meditate, &amp;c. From the&s;e different degrees of the organic ela&s;|ticity of the fibres, re&s;ults every diver&s;ity in the operations of the mind.</P>
<P>Regular thought ever requires a ten&s;ion of the fibres: but to think on &s;ome parti|cular &s;ubjects, there is required a much greater degree of organic ela&s;ticity in the fibres, than to think on &s;ome others; as on metaphy&s;ical &s;ubjects, than on tho&s;e of elementary geometry; there is likewi&s;e
<PB N="258" REF="265">required a much greater degree of organic ela&s;ticity to meditate than to reflect, to imagine &s;omething new, than to judge of &s;imple facts. Thus with one degree of organic ela&s;ticity Man can reflect, with another meditate; &s;o with one he can imagine, and with another weaker degree, which leaves him unable to recall the ideas and &s;en&s;ations formerly depo&s;ited in the memory, he can pronounce on his pre|&s;ent &s;en&s;ations only, and &s;eems to have lo&s;t every faculty but in&s;tinct: with a degree, yet weaker than this, he is unable to com|bine two &s;ingle &s;en&s;ations, and is de&s;titute of every &s;entiment, even that of his own exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Thus Man may lo&s;e the power of me|ditation, and retain that of reflection; he may lo&s;e imagination, &s;agacity, and pene|tration, and retain good &s;en&s;e; la&s;tly, he may lo&s;e judgment, and yet retain in&s;tinct.</P>
<P>Both remembrance and recollection re|quire the organic ela&s;ticity of the fibres; but not in an equal degree. Recollection requires the greater degree of ten&s;ion of the two, as any one may be convinced by the efforts which a mind, exhau&s;ted by
<PB N="259" REF="266">&s;tudy, or during the &s;tate of convale&s;|cence or drow&s;ine&s;s, vainly makes to re|call the mo&s;t familiar ideas, &s;uch as when called to mind by being mentioned by others, it remembers to have before receiv|ed. This is very natural; for it requires more attention to fix on an ab&s;ent ob|ject, than on one which is pre&s;ent; to re|call an analogy without the aid of the &s;en|&s;es, as in remembrance by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of objects, than to di&s;cover its identity: Man therefore may lo&s;e recollection and yet retain remembrance.</P>
<P>Finally, a greater degree of organic e|la&s;ticity is required to recall extraordinary ideas, than to recollect tho&s;e which are fa|miliar; and ab&s;tract ideas than &s;imple: &s;o likewi&s;e Man may forget one particular &s;ort of ideas, and yet retain another. Thus the different degrees of organic ela&s;ticity of the fibres produce new combinations, which interrupt the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our thoughts, di&s;order the chain of our ideas, and &s;eem even to annihilate &s;ome of ous mental faculties, while they leave us the free exerci&s;e of others. This is the &s;im|ple and manife&s;t cau&s;e of the&s;e &s;ingular phenomena.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="267">The different degrees of organic ela&s;|ticity required in the different operations of the mind, may be determined by com|paring the cour&s;e of the fluids, the num|ber of pul&s;ations, their different degrees of force and vivacity, in one man during meditation, in another during reflection, and in another during revery; and by comparing the cour&s;e of the fluids, the number of pul&s;ations, their different de|grees of force and vivacity in the &s;ame man in all the&s;e different &s;tates.</P>
<P>Thus having &s;hewn the principles of the&s;e phenomena in the different tones of the fibres, having di&s;covered the truth of the&s;e laws in Nature, we may ea&s;ily proceed to e&s;timate their effects: notwith|&s;tanding this &s;ubject may be extremely complicated, and may appear to have but little connection with mathematics, it is po&s;&s;ible to determine their relations, and to &s;ubject them to a preci&s;e evaluation; the balance has been already pointed out, it now remains only to take the amount.</P>
<P><HI>From what has preceded, it is certain that the propen&s;ities, the affections and cha|racter of the &s;oul, folly, wi&s;dom, &s;tupidity,
<PB N="261" REF="268">prudence, rea&s;on, imagination, recollection, remembrance, penetration, delicacy, &s;ublimity, depth, &s;agacity and genius, are not qualities inherent in the mind, but modes of the &s;oul's exi&s;tence, depending on the &s;tate of the organs of the body;</HI> as for in&s;tance, colours, &s;ounds, heat, cold, &amp;c. are not e&s;&s;ential attributes of matter, but qualities dependent on its texture, and on the motion of its con&s;titu|ent corpu&s;cles. It is therefore evident, that organization alone cau&s;es almo&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let it be once more noticed, that I pretend not to &s;ubject the <HI>whole</HI> to phy&s;ical laws; I am well a&s;&s;ured, that the &s;oul <HI>partly</HI> receives its character from moral cau&s;es.</NOTE> every difference which is ob&s;erved between &s;ouls; that they receive their principal cha|racteri&s;tics from the corporeal organs; and that, &s;uppo&s;ing them really in their na|ture different from each other, this dif|ference would be of no effect, &s;o long as they continue united to the body.</P>
<P>Thus every thing in Nature is influenced by phy&s;ical laws.</P>
<P><HI>Corporeal &s;en&s;ibility, the regular or di&s;or|dered cour&s;e of our fluids, primitive or or|ganic
<PB N="262" REF="269">ela&s;ticity, the rigidity or relaxation of the fibres, the force or volume of the organs, are the cau&s;es of the &s;urpri&s;ing diver&s;ities in &s;ouls, and the &s;ecret principles of that great influ|ence of the &s;oul on the body, and of the body on the &s;oul, hitherto deemed an impenetrable my&s;tery.</HI></P>
<P>Such are the &s;ecret cau&s;es of that &s;in|gular harmony, which philo&s;ophers have ob&s;erved between the two &s;ub&s;tances which form our being, but were unable to explain.</P>
<P>Such, in a word, are the true founda|tions, the &s;olid ba&s;is of a &s;cience, where|in every thing appeared arbitrary, ob&s;cure and my&s;terious.</P>
<P>I would here conclude my work, were philo&s;ophers only to be my readers: to &s;uch it might be &s;ufficient to explain the principles on which I ground my doctrine, and I might have &s;pared my&s;elf the trou|ble of entering into the&s;e particulars which are nece&s;&s;ary to elucidate them. But this were lo&s;t labour: &s;ince, for one reader who can develop the whole of a &s;y&s;tem by the mere outlines, there are a thou|&s;and who mu&s;t &s;ee the whole chain of rea|&s;oning,
<PB N="263" REF="270">in order to comprehend the prin|ciples on which it is e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>To the&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary to enter into a minute di&s;cu&s;&s;ion: it is not enough that they have given them a clue to guide them to the truth, and have the path pointed out to them; they mu&s;t be, as it were, led by the hand through all the mazes of the labyrinth; otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t una|voidably be bewildered in it.</P>
