He means to &s;ay, in plain pro&s;e, that we wi&s;h to be remembered by our friends after our death, in the &s;ame manner as when alive we wi&s;hed to be remembered by them in our ab&s;ence: this would be expre&s;&s;ed clearer, if the metaphorical term <HI>fires</HI> was rejected, and the line run thus:</Q></P>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO Sir THOMAS HANMER<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">A &s;tate&s;man of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, and a polite writer. He was de&s;cended from a very ancient family in North Wales, and was born in 1676. In the year 1712 he was cho&s;en Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and died in May, 1746, &s;oon after the publication of his edition of Shak&s;peare. Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erves that he was a man eminently qualified for &s;uch &s;tudies as that which occa&s;ioned the pre|&s;ent epi&s;tle. <Q>He had (as the &s;ame author remarks) what is the fir&s;t requi&s;ite to emendatory critici&s;m, that intuition by which the poet's intention is immediately di&s;covered, and that dexterity of intellect which di&s;patches its work by the ea&s;ie&s;t means. He had undoubtedly read much; his acquaintance with cu&s;toms, opinions, and traditions, &s;eems to have been large; and he is often learned without &s;hew. He &s;eldom pa&s;&s;es what he does not under&s;tand, without an attempt to find or to make a meaning, and &s;ometimes ha&s;tily makes what a little more attention would have found. He is &s;olicitous to reduce to grammar, what he could not be &s;ure that his author intended to be grammatical. Shak&s;peare regarded more the &s;eries of ideas than of words; and his language not being de&s;igned for the reader's de&s;k, was all that he de&s;ired it to be, if it conveyed his meaning to the au|dience.</Q> Preface to Shak&s;peare, p. 46.</NOTE>, On his EDITION of SHAKSPEARE's WORKS.</HEAD>

<HEAD>ELEGY To Mi&s;s DASHWOOD. In the Manner of OVID.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. HAMMOND<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This gentleman, &s;ays Dr. John&s;on, was the &s;econd &s;on of Anthony Hammond, a man of note among the wits, poets, and parliamentary orators in the beginning of this century, who was allied to Sir Robert Walpole by marrying his &s;i&s;ter. He was born about 1710, and educated at We&s;tmin&s;ter-&s;chool; but it does not appear that he was of any univer&s;ity. He was equerry to the Prince of Wales, and &s;eems to have come very early into publick notice, and to have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by tho&s;e who&s;e patronage and friend&s;hip prejudiced mankind at that time in favour of tho&s;e on whom they were be&s;towed; for he was the companion of Cobham, Lyttelton, and Che&s;terfield. He is &s;aid to have divided his life between plea&s;ure and books, in his retirement forgetting the town, and in his gaiety lo&s;ing the &s;tudent. Of his literary hours, <HI>The Love Elegies</HI> and the pre&s;ent Poem are the mo&s;t material. In 1741 he was cho&s;en into Parliament for Truro in Cornwall; being probably one of tho&s;e who were elected by the Prince's influence; and died next year in June, at Stowe, the famous &s;eat of the Lord Cobham. His mi&s;tre&s;s, the lady to whom this Elegy is addre&s;&s;ed, long out-lived him, and in 1779 died unmarried. The character which her lover bequeathed her was indeed not likely to attract court&s;hip.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<L>From reflection and hope little comfort we find,</L>
<L>To po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion alone let thy thoughts be confin'd;</L>
<L>To-day's all the trea&s;ure poor mortals can boa&s;t,</L>
<L>For to-morrow's not gain'd, and ye&s;terday's lo&s;t;</L>

<HEAD>THE SQUIRE OF DAMES. A POEM. IN SPENSER's STILE, BY MOSES MENDEZ ESQ.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Of Mitcham in Surry, a gentleman of the Jewi&s;h religion, author of three dramatick pieces, a poem called Henry and Blanche, printed in 4to, 1746, and &s;everal other performances &s;cattered in different mi&s;|cellanies.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In the &s;eventh Canto of the Legend of <HI>Cha&s;tity,</HI> in <HI>Spen&s;er's Fairy Queen,</HI> the Squire of <HI>Dames</HI> tells <HI>Satyrane,</HI> that by order of his mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>Columbel,</HI> (after having &s;erved the ladies for a year) he was &s;ent out a &s;econd time, not to return till he could find three hundred women incapable of yielding to any temptation. The bad &s;ucce&s;s he met with in the cour&s;e of three years, which is &s;lightly touch'd upon by <HI>Spen&s;er,</HI> is the foundation of the following poem.</P>

<HEAD>The LAWYER'S FAREWELL to his MUSE. Written in the year 1744.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Sir WILLIAM BLACKSTONE<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This accompli&s;hed lawyer was born in Cheap&s;ide, 10th of July, 1723, and was the youge&s;t &s;on of Mr. Charles Black&s;tone, who carried on the bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;ilkman. At the age of &s;even years he was put to &s;chool at the Charter-hou&s;e, and in 1735 admitted on the foundation there by the nomination of Sir Robert Walpole. On the 30th of No|vember, 1738, ha was entered a commoner at Pembroke College, Ox|ford, was matriculated the next day, and in Febuary following elected to one of Lady Holford's exhibitions for Charter-hou&s;e &s;cholars. De|termining to make choice of the law for his profe&s;&s;ion, he entered him|&s;elf in the Middle Temple the 20th of November, 1741. In Novem|ber, 1743, he was elected into the &s;ociety of All Souls College. On the 12th of July, 1745, he commenced Batchelor of the Civil Law; and on the 28th of November, 1746, was called to the bar. He proceeded, 26th of April, 1750, Doctor of Civil Law; and having attended the courts at We&s;tmin&s;ter with little &s;ucce&s;s, he in 1753 determined to re|tire to an academical life. He accordingly, in Michaelmas Term that year, began to read lectures on the laws of England at Oxford. On the 22d of October, 1758, he was unanimou&s;ly elected Vinerian Profe&s;&s;or of the Common Law at that univer&s;ity. In the &s;ucceeding year he re|turned to the practice of his profe&s;&s;ion in London; and in Michaelmas Term re&s;umed his attendance at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where his merit was now both known and rewarded. On the 28th of July, 1761, he was ap|pointed principal of New Inn Hall; and on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Queen's family was named Solicitor General to her Maje&s;ty. In 1766 he re&s;igned his po&s;ts in the univer&s;ity of Oxford; and on the 9th of February, 1770, was nominated a Judge in the Common Pleas; but, to accommodate Sir Jo&s;eph Yates, con&s;ented to accept a &s;eat in the Court of King's Bench, from whence he was &s;oon removed to the place of his original de&s;tination. From this period to the time of his death he de|voted his attention to the &s;ervice of the public, and the duties of do|me&s;tic life. About Chri&s;tmas, 1779, he was &s;eized with a violent &s;hortne&s;s of breath, from which he in &s;ome mea&s;ure recovered; but the di&s;order returning with fre&s;h vigour, it brought on a drow&s;ine&s;s and &s;tu|por, which put an end to his life, on the 14th of Febuary, 1780, in the 56th year of his age.</NOTE>, Knt.</BYLINE>

In 1735 he was cho&s;en member for the county of Monmouth, and was re-elected in 1739, on being ap|pointed payma&s;ter of the marine regiments, and again at the general election in 1741. On the 20th of October, 1744, he was in&s;talled a Knight of the Bath, and in 1746 appointed mini&s;ter to the court of Ber|lin. He continued in that &s;ituation until the 9th of May, 1749, when he was named envoy extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the &s;ame court. In 1754 he repre&s;ented the borough of Leomin&s;ter, and about that time went amba&s;&s;ador to the court of Ruffia. He acquitted him|&s;elf in his &s;everal employments abroad with con&s;iderable abilities; but falling into an ill &s;tate of health, he returned to England, and died the 2d of November, 1759.</NOTE>, Knt. of the Bath.</HEAD>

Entering early into holy orders he &s;ettled fir&s;t at Bramham in York&s;hire, and afterwards at Croydon, where he held the curacy. In this &s;ituation he recommended him&s;elf to the notice of Archbi&s;hop Herring, who then re&s;ided at the latter place on account of his health; and, in 1755, was, by that pre|late, collated to the vicarage of Orpington with St. Mary Cray, in Kent.
