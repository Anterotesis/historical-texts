<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AS a De&s;ign among the Exci&s;e Officers through|out the Kingdom is on Foot, for an humble Application to Parliament next Se&s;&s;ion, to have the State of their Salaries taken into Con&s;ideration; it has been judged not only expedient, but highly ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pre&s;ent a State of their Ca&s;e, previous to the Pre&s;entation of their Petition.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Ca&s;es &s;o &s;ingularly rea&s;onable, that the more they are con&s;idered, the more Weight they obtain. It is a &s;trong Evidence both of Sim|plicity, and hone&s;t Confidence, when Petiti|oners in any Ca&s;e, ground their Hopes of Relief, on having their Ca&s;e fully and perfectly known and under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Simple as this Subject may appear at fir&s;t, it is a Matter, in my humble Opinion, not unworthy a Parliamentary Attention. 'Tis a Subject inter|woven with a Variety of Rea&s;ons from different Cau&s;es. New Matter will ari&s;e on every Thought. <HI>If the Poverty of the Officers of Exci&s;e; if the Temptations ari&s;ing from their Poverty; if the Qualifications of Per|&s;ons to be admitted into the Employment; if the Security of
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
the Revenue it&s;elf,</HI> are Matters of any Weight, then I am con&s;cious that my voluntary Services in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, will produce &s;ome good Effect or other, either to the better Security of the Revenue, the Relief of the Officers, or both.</P>

<HEAD>THE STATE, Of the SALARY Of the <HI>Officers</HI> of <HI>EXCISE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN a Year's Salary is mentioned in the Gro&s;s, it acquires a Degree of Con&s;equence from its <HI>Sound,</HI> which it would not have if &s;eparated into daily Payments, and if the Charges attend|ing the receiving, and other unavoidable Expences were con&s;idered with it. Fifty Pounds a Year, and One Shil|ling and Ninepence Farthing a Day, carry as different Degrees of Significancy with them, as My Lord's Steward, and the Steward's Labourer; and yet an Out-Ride Offi|cer in the Exci&s;e, under the Name of Fifty Pounds a Year receives for him&s;elf no more than One Shilling and Ninepence Farthing a Day.</P>
<P>After Tax, Charity, and &s;itting Expences are deducted, there remains very little more than Forty-&s;ix Pounds; and the Expences of Hor&s;e-keeping in many Places cannot be brought under Fourteen Pounds a Year, be|&s;ides the Purcha&s;e at fir&s;t, and the Hazard of Life, which reduces it to Thirty-two Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> or One Shilling and Ninepence Farthing <HI>per</HI> Day.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">I have &s;poken more particularly of the Out-Rides, as they are by far the mo&s;t numerous, being in Proportion to the Foot-Walks as Eight is to Five throughout the Kingdom. Yet in the latter the &s;ame Misfortunes exi&s;t, the Channel of them only is altered. The exce&s;&s;ive dear|ne&s;s of Hou&s;e-rent, the great Burthen of Rates and Taxes, and the exce&s;&s;ive Price of all the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, in Cities and large Trading Towns, nearly counter-balance the Expences of Hor&s;e-keeping. Every Office has its Stages of Promotion, but the pecuniary Advantages ari&s;ing from a Foot-Walk are &s;o incon&s;iderable, and the Lo&s;s of di&s;po&s;ing of Effects, or the Charges of removing them to any con&s;iderable Di&s;tance &s;o great, that many Out-ride Officers with a Family remain as they are, from an Ina|bility to bear the Lo&s;s, or &s;upport the Expence.</P>
<P>The Officers re&s;ident in the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> are exempt from the particular Di&s;advantages of Removals. This &s;eems to be the only Circum&s;tance which they enjoy &s;uperior to their Country Brethren. In every other re&s;pect they lay under the &s;ame Hard&s;hips, and &s;uffer the &s;ame Di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>There are no Perqui&s;ites or Advantages in the lea&s;t, an|nexed to the Employment. A few Officers who are &s;ta|tioned along the Coa&s;t, may &s;ometimes have the good Fortune to fall in with a Seizure of contraband Goods, and yet, that frequently at the Hazard of their Lives: But the inland Officers can have no &s;uch Opportunities. Be|&s;ides, the &s;urveying Duty in the Exci&s;e is &s;o continual, that without Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s from the real Bu&s;ine&s;s it&s;elf, there is no Time to &s;eek after them. With the Officers of the Cu&s;toms it is quite otherwi&s;e, their whole Time and Care is appropriated to that Service, and their Profits are in pro|portion to their Vigilance.</P>
<P>If the Increa&s;e of Money in the Kingdom is one Cau&s;e of the high Price of Provi&s;ions, the Ca&s;e of the Exci&s;e-Officers is peculiarly pitiable. No Increa&s;e comes to them &mdash; They are &s;hut out from the general Ble&s;&s;ing &mdash;
<PB N="7" REF="6">
They behold it like a Map of <HI>Peru</HI>&mdash; The An&s;wer of <HI>Abraham</HI> to <HI>Dives</HI> is &s;omewhat applicable to them, <Q>There is a great Gulf fix'd.</Q></P>
<P>To the Wealthy and Humane, it is a Matter worthy of Concern, that their Affluence &s;hould become the Misfor|tune of others. Were the Money in the Kingdom to be increa&s;ed double, the Salary would in Value be re|duced one half. Every Step upwards, is a Step down|wards with them. Not to be Partakers of the Increa&s;e would be a little hard, but to be Sufferers by it is exceed|ingly &s;o. The Mechanic and the Labourer may in a great Mea&s;ure ward off the Di&s;tre&s;s, by rai&s;ing the Price of their Manufactures or their Work, but the Situation of the Of|ficers, admit of no &s;uch Relief.</P>
<P>Another Con&s;ideration in their Behalf (and which is pe|culiar to the Exci&s;e) is, that as the Law of their Office re|moves them far from all their natural Friends and Rela|tions, it con&s;equently prevents tho&s;e occa&s;ional A&s;&s;i&s;tan|ces from them, which are &s;erviccably felt in a Family, and which even the poore&s;t, among the Poor enjoys. Mo&s;t poor Mechanics, or even common Labourers, have &s;ome Relations or Friends, who, either out of Benevolence, or Pride, keep their Children from Nakedne&s;s, &s;upply them occa&s;ionally with perhaps half a Hog, a Load of Wood, a Chaldron of Coals, or &s;omething or other which abates the Severity of their Di&s;tre&s;s, and yet tho&s;e Men thus re|lieved will frequently earn, more than the daily Pay of an Exci&s;e Officer.</P>
<P>Perhaps an Officer will appear more reputable with the &s;ame Pay than a Mechanic or Labourer. The difference ari&s;es from Sentiment, not Circum&s;tances. A &s;omething like reputable Pride makes all the Di&s;tinction, and the thinking Part of Mankind well knows, that none &s;uffer &s;o much as they who endeavour to conceal their Nece&s;&s;i|ties.</P>
<P>The frequent Removals which unavoidably happen in the Exci&s;e, are attended with &s;uch an Expence, e&s;pecially
<PB N="8" REF="7">
where there is a Family, as few Officers are able to &s;up|port. About two Years ago an Officer with a Family, under Orders for removing, and rather embarra&s;&s;ed Cir|cum&s;tances, made his Application to me, and from a Con|viction of his Di&s;tre&s;s, I advanced a &s;mall Sum to enable him to proceed. He ingenuou&s;ly declared, that without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome Friend, he &s;hould be driven to do Inju&s;tice to his Creditors, and compelled to de&s;ert the Duty of his Office. He has &s;ince hone&s;tly paid me, and does as well as the Narrowne&s;s of &s;uch Circum&s;tances can admit of.</P>
<P>There is one general allowed Truth, which will al|ways operate in their Favour, which is, that no Set of Men under his Maje&s;ty, earn their Salary with any Com|pari&s;on of Labour and Fatigue with that of the Officers of Exci&s;e. The Station may rather be called a Seat of con&s;tant Work, than either a Place, or an Employment. Even in the different Departments of the general Revenue they are unequalled in the Burthen of Bu&s;ine&s;s; a Riding-Officer's Place in the Cu&s;toms, who&s;e Salary is 60 l. a Year, is <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> to theirs; and the Work in the Window-Light Duty, compared with the Exci&s;e, is <HI>Lightne&s;s it&s;elf,</HI> yet their Salary is &s;ubject to no Tax, they receive Forty-nine Pounds Twelve Shillings and Sixpence, without De|duction.</P>
<P>The Inconveniencies which affect an Exci&s;e Officer are almo&s;t endle&s;s; even the Land Tax A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment upon their Salaries, which though the Government pays, falls often with Hard&s;hip upon them. The Place of their Re&s;idence, on account of the Land Tax, has in many In&s;tances created frequent Contentions between Pari&s;hes, in which the Officer, though the innocent and unconcerned Cau&s;e of the Quarrel, has been the greater Sufferer.</P>
<P>To point out particularly the Impo&s;&s;ibility of an Exci&s;e Officer &s;upporting him&s;elf and Family, with any proper Degree of Credit and Reputation, on &s;o &s;canty a Pittance, is altogether unnece&s;&s;ary. The Times, the Voice of ge|neral
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Want, is Proof it&s;elf. Where Facts are &s;ufficient, Arguments are u&s;ele&s;s; and the Hints which I have pro|duced are &s;uch as affect the Officers of Exci&s;e <HI>differently</HI> to any other Set of Men. A &s;ingle Man may barely live; but as it is not the De&s;ign of the Legi&s;lature, or the Honourable Board of Exci&s;e, to impo&s;e a State of Celi|bacy on them, the Condition of much the greater Part is truly wretched and pitiable.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be &s;aid, Why do the Exci&s;e Officers complain; they are not pre&s;&s;ed into the Service, and may relinqui&s;h it when they plea&s;e; if they can mend them|&s;elves, why don't they? Alas! what a Mockery of Pity would it be, to give &s;uch an An&s;wer to an hone&s;t, faith|ful old Officer in the Exci&s;e, who had &s;pent the Prime of his Life in the Service, and was become unfit for any Thing el&s;e. The Time limited for an Admi&s;&s;ion into an Exci&s;e Employment, is between twenty-one and thirty Years of Age&mdash;the very Flower of Life. Every other Hope and Con&s;ideration is then given up, and the Chance of e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves in any other Bu&s;ine&s;s, becomes in a few Years not only lo&s;t to them, but they become lo&s;t to it.</P>
<P><Q>There is a Tide in the Affairs of Men, which if embraced, leads on to Fortune&mdash;<HI>That neglected,</HI> all beyond is Mi&s;ery or Want.</Q></P>
<P>When we con&s;ider how few in the Exci&s;e arrive at any comfortable Eminence, and the Date of Life when &s;uch Promotions only can happen, the great Hazard there is of ill, rather than good Fortune in the Attempt, and that all the Years antecedent to that is a State of mere Exi&s;tence, wherein they are &s;hut out from the common Chance of Succe&s;s in any other Way; a Reply like that can be only a Deri&s;ion of their Wants. 'Tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible after any long Continuance in the Exci&s;e, that they <HI>can</HI> live any other Way. Such as are of Trades, would have their Trade to learn over again; and People would have but little Opinion of their Abilities in any Calling, who had
<PB N="10" REF="9">
been ten, fifteen, or twenty Years ab&s;ent from it. Every Year's Experience gained in the Exci&s;e, is a Year's Ex|perience lo&s;t in Trade; and by the Time they become wi&s;e Officers, they become fooli&s;h Workmen.</P>
<P>Were the Rea&s;ons for augmenting the Salary grounded only on the Charitablene&s;s of &s;o doing, they would have great Weight with the Compa&s;&s;ionate. But there are Auxiliaries of &s;uch a powerful Ca&s;t, that in the Opinion of Policy, they obtain the Rank of Originals. The fir&s;t is truly the Ca&s;e of the Officers, but this is rather the Ca&s;e of the Revenue.</P>
<P>The Di&s;tre&s;&s;es in the Exci&s;e are &s;o generally known, that Numbers of Gentlemen, and other Inhabitants in Places where Officers are re&s;ident, have generou&s;ly and humanely recommended their Ca&s;e to the Members of the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons: And Numbers of Traders of Opulence and Reputation, well knowing that the Po|verty of an Officer may &s;ubject him to the fraudulent De|&s;igns of &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h Per&s;ons under his Survey, to the great Injury of the fair Trader, and Trade in general, have, from Principles both of Genero&s;ity and Ju&s;tice, joined in the &s;ame Recommendation.</P>

<HEAD>THOUGHTS <HI>On the Corruption of Principles, and on the numerous Evils</HI> Ari&s;ing to the Revenue from the too great Poverty of the <HI>Officers</HI> of <HI>Exci&s;e.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT has always been the Wi&s;dom of Government to con|&s;ider the Situation and Circum&s;tances of Per&s;ons in Tru&s;t. Why are large Salaries given in many In&s;tances, but to proportion it to the Tru&s;t, to &s;et Men above Temp|tation, and to make it even literally worth their while to be hone&s;t. The Salaries of the Judges have been augmented, and their Places made independent even on the Crown it|&s;elf, for the above wi&s;e Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Certainly there can be nothing unrea&s;onable in &s;up|po&s;ing there is &s;uch an In&s;tinct as Frailty among the Offi|cers of Exci&s;e, in common with the re&s;t of Mankind; and that the mo&s;t effectual Method to keep Men hone&s;t, is to enable them to live &s;o. The Tenderne&s;s of Con|&s;cience is too often overmatched by the Sharpne&s;s of Want; and Principle, like Cha&s;tity, yields with ju&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="11">
Reluctance enough to excu&s;e it&s;elf. There is a powerful Rhetorick in Nece&s;&s;ity, which exceeds even a <HI>Dunning,</HI> or a <HI>Wedderburne.</HI> No Argument can &s;atisfy the Feelings of Hunger, or abate the Edge of Appetite. Nothing tends to a greater Corruption of Manners and Principles, than a too great Di&s;tre&s;s of Circum&s;tances; and the Cor|ruption is of that Kind, that it &s;preads a Plai&s;ter for it|&s;elf: Like a Viper, it carries a Cure, though a fal&s;e one, for its own Poi&s;on. <HI>Agur,</HI> without any Alternative, has made Di&s;hone&s;ty the immediate Con&s;equence of Poverty, "Le&s;t I be poor and &s;teal." A very little Degree of that dangerous Kind of Philo&s;ophy, which is the almo&s;t cer|tain Effect of involuntary Poverty, will teach Men to be|lieve, that to &s;tarve is more criminal than to &s;teal, by as much as every Species of Self-Murder exceeds every other Crime; that true Hone&s;ty is &s;entimental, and the Practice of it dependent upon Circum&s;tances. If the Gay find it difficult to re&s;i&s;t the Allurements of Plea&s;ure; the Great the Temptations of Ambition; or the Mi&s;er the Acqui|&s;ition of Wealth; how much &s;tronger are the Provoca|tions of Want and Poverty. The Excitements to Plea|&s;ure, Grandeur, or Riches, are mere <Q>Shadows of a Shade,</Q> compared to the irre&s;i&s;table Nece&s;&s;ities of Na|ture. Not to be led into Temptation, is the Prayer of Divinity it&s;elf; and to guard again&s;t, or rather to pre|vent &s;uch in&s;naring Situations, is one of the greate&s;t Heights of Human Prudence: In private Life it is partly religious; and in a Revenue Sen&s;e, it is truly political.</P>
<P>The Rich, in Ea&s;e and Affluence, may think I have drawn an unnatural Portrait; but could they de&s;cend to the cold Regions of Want, the Circle of Polar Poverty, they would find their Opinions changing with the Cli|mate. There are Habits of Thinking peculiar to diffe|rent Conditions, and to find them out is truly to &s;tudy Mankind.</P>
<P>That the Situation of an Exci&s;e Officer is of this dan|gerous Kind, mu&s;t be allowed by every one who will con|&s;ider
<PB N="13" REF="12">
the Tru&s;t unavoidably repo&s;ed in him, and compare the Narrowne&s;s of his Circum&s;tances with the Hard&s;hip of the Times. If the Salary was judged competent an Hundred Years ago, it cannot be &s;o now. Should it be advanced, that if the pre&s;ent Set of Officers are di&s;&s;atisfied with the Salary, that enow may be procured not only for the pre&s;ent Salary, but for le&s;s; the An&s;wer is ex|tremely ea&s;y. The Que&s;tion needs only be put; it de|&s;troys it&s;elf. Were Two or Three Thou&s;and Men to offer to execute the Office without any Salary, would the Government accept them? No. Were the &s;ame Number to offer the &s;ame Service for a Salary le&s;s than can po&s;&s;ibly &s;upport them, would the Government accept them? Cer|tainly No; for while Nature, in &s;pite of Law or Reli|gion, makes it a ruling Principle not to &s;tarve, the Event would be this; that as they could not live on the Salary, they would di&s;cretionarily live out of the Duty. Quaere, whether Poverty has not too great an Influence now? Were the Employment a Place of direct Labour, and not of Tru&s;t, then Frugality in the Salary would be &s;ound Policy: But when it is con&s;idered that the greate&s;t &s;ingle Branch of the Revenue, a Duty amounting to near Five Millions Sterling, is annually charged by a Set of Men, mo&s;t of whom are wanting even the common Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, the Thought mu&s;t to every Friend to Hone&s;ty, to every Per&s;on concerned in the Management of the Pub|lic Money, be &s;trong and &s;triking. Poor and in Power, are powerful Temptations; I call it Power, becau&s;e they have it in their Power to defraud. The Tru&s;t unavoida|bly repo&s;ed in an Exci&s;e Officer is &s;o great, that it would be an Act of Wi&s;dom, and perhaps of Intere&s;t, to &s;ecure him from the Temptations of downright Poverty. To relieve their Wants would be Charity, but to &s;ecure the Revenue by &s;o doing would be Prudence. Scarce a Week pa&s;&s;es at the Office but &s;ome Detections are made of frau|dulent and collu&s;ive Proceedings. The Poverty of the Offi|cers
<PB N="14" REF="13">
is the faire&s;t Bait for a de&s;igning Trader that can po&s;&s;ibly be; &s;uch introduce them&s;elves to the Officer un|der the common Plea of the In&s;ufficiency of the Salary. Every con&s;iderate Mind mu&s;t allow, that Poverty and Op|portunity corrupt many an hone&s;t Man. I am not at all &s;urpri&s;ed that &s;o many opulent and reputable Traders have recommended the Ca&s;e of the Officers to the good Favour of their Repre&s;entatives. They are &s;en&s;ible of the pinch|ing Circum&s;tances of the Officers, and of the Injury to Trade in general from the Advantages which are taken of them. The Welfare of the fair Trader and the Security of the Revenue are &s;o in&s;eparably one, that their Intere&s;ts or Injuries are alike. It is the Opinion of &s;uch who&s;e Si|tuation give them a perfect Knowledge in the Matter, that the Revenue &s;uffers more by the Corruption of a few Officers in a County, than would make a hand&s;ome Addition to the Salary of the whole Number in the &s;ame Place.</P>
<P>I very lately knew an In&s;tance where it is evident, on Compari&s;on of the Duty charged &s;ince, that the Revenue &s;uffered by one Trader (and he not a very con&s;iderable one) upwards of One Hundred and Sixty Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> for &s;everal Years; and yet the Benefit to the Offi|cer was a mere Trifle, in Con&s;ideration of the Trader's. Without Doubt the Officer would have thought him&s;elf much happier to have received the &s;ame Addition another Way. The Bread of Deceit is a Bread of Bitterne&s;s; but alas! how few in Times of Want and Hard&s;hip are capable of thinking &s;o: Objects appear under new Co|lours, and in Shapes not naturally their own; Hunger &s;ucks in the Deception, and Nece&s;&s;ity reconciles it to Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners of Exci&s;e &s;trongly enjoin that no Officer accept any Treat, Gratuity, or, in &s;hort, lay him&s;elf under any kind of Obligation to the Traders un|der their Survey: The Wi&s;dom of &s;uch an Injunction is
<PB N="15" REF="14">
evident; but the Practice of it, to a Per&s;on &s;urrounded with Children and Poverty, is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible; and &s;uch Obligations, wherever they exi&s;t, mu&s;t operate, directly, or indirectly, to the Injury of the Revenue. Favours will naturally beget their Likene&s;&s;es, e&s;pecially where the Return is not at our own Expence.</P>
<P>I have heard it remarked by a Gentleman who&s;e Know|ledge in Exci&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s is indi&s;putable, that there are Numbers of Officers who are even afraid to look into an unentered Room, le&s;t they &s;hould give Offence. Poverty and Obligation tye up the Hands of Office, and give a prejudicial Bias to the Mind.</P>
<P>There is another kind of Evil, which, though it may never amount to what may be deemed Criminality in Law, yet it may amount to what is much wor&s;e in Effect, and that is, <HI>a con&s;tant and perpetual Leakage in the Revenue:</HI> A Sort of Gratitude in the Dark, a di&s;tant Requital for &s;uch Civilities as only the lowe&s;t Poverty would accept, and which are a Thou&s;and <HI>per Cent.</HI> above the Value of the Civility received. Yet here is no immediate Collu&s;ion; the Trader and Officer are both &s;afe, the De&s;ign, if di&s;|covered, pa&s;&s;es for Error.</P>
<P>The&s;e, with numberle&s;s other Evils, have all their Origin in the Poverty of the Officers. Poverty, in De|fiance of Principle, begets a Degree of Meanne&s;s that will &s;toop to almo&s;t any Thing. A thou&s;and Refinements of Argument may be brought to prove, that the Practice of Hone&s;ty will be &s;till the &s;ame, in the mo&s;t trying and ne|ce&s;&s;itous Circum&s;tances. He who never was an hunger'd may argue finely on the Subjection of his Appetite, and he who never was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, may harangue as beautifully on the Power of Principle. But Poverty, like Grief, has an incurable Deafne&s;s, which never hears; the Oration lo&s;es all its Edge; and "<HI>To be, or not to be,</HI> becomes the only Que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">There is a &s;triking Difference between Di&s;hone&s;ty ari&s;|ing from Want of Food, and Want of Principle. The fir&s;t is worthy of Compa&s;&s;ion, the other of Puni&s;hment. Nature never produced a Man who would &s;tarve in a well &s;tored Larder, becau&s;e the Provi&s;ions were not his own: But he who robs it from Luxury of Appetite de&s;erves a Gibbet.</P>
<P>There is another Evil which the Poverty of the Salary produces, and which nothing but an Augmentation of it can remove; and that is, Negligence and Indifference. The&s;e may not appear of &s;uch dark Complexion as Fraud, and Collu&s;ion, but their Injuries to the Revenue are the &s;ame. It is impo&s;&s;ible that any Office or Bu&s;ine&s;s can be regarded as it ought, where this ruinous Di&s;po&s;ition ex|i&s;ts. It requires no &s;ort of Argument to prove that the Value &s;et upon any Place or Employment will be in Pro|portion to the Value of it; and that Diligence or Neg|ligence will ari&s;e from the &s;ame Cau&s;e. The continual Number of Relinqui&s;hments and Di&s;charges always hap|pening in the Exci&s;e, are evident Proofs of it.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons fir&s;t coming into the Exci&s;e form very different Notions of it, to what they have afterwards. The gay Ideas of Promotion &s;oon expire. The Continuance of Work, the Strictne&s;s of the Duty, and the Poverty of the Salary, &s;oon beget Negligence and Indifference: The Cour&s;e continues for a while, the Revenue &s;uffers, and the Officer is di&s;charged: The Vacancy is &s;oon filled up, new ones ari&s;e to produce the &s;ame Mi&s;chief, and &s;hare the &s;ame Fate.</P>
<P>What adds &s;till more to the Weight of this Grievance is, that this de&s;tructive Di&s;po&s;ition reigns mo&s;t among &s;uch as are otherwi&s;e the mo&s;t proper and qualified for the Employment; &s;uch as are neither fit for the Exci&s;e, or any Thing el&s;e, are glad to hold in by any Means: But the Revenue lies at as much Hazard from their Want of Judgment, as from the other's Want of Diligence.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">In private Life no Man would tru&s;t the Execution of any important Concern, to a Servant who was carele&s;s whether he did it or not, and the &s;ame Rule mu&s;t hold good in a Revenue Sen&s;e. The Commi&s;&s;ioners may con|tinue di&s;charging every Day, and the Example will have no Weight while the Salary is an Object &s;o incon&s;iderable, and this Di&s;po&s;ition has &s;uch a general Exi&s;tence. Should it be advanced, that if Men will be carele&s;s of &s;uch Bread as is in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they will &s;till be the &s;ame were it better; I an&s;wer, that as the Di&s;po&s;ition I am &s;peaking of, is not the Effect of natural Idlene&s;s, but of Di&s;&s;atisfaction in point of Profit, they would <HI>not</HI> con|tinue the &s;ame. A good Servant will be careful of a good Place, though very indifferent about a bad one. Be&s;ides, this Spirit of Indifference, &s;hould it procure a Di&s;charge, is no ways affecting to their Circum&s;tances. The ea&s;y Tran&s;ition of a qualified Officer to a 'Compting-Hou&s;e, or at lea&s;t a School-Ma&s;ter, at any Time, as it naturally &s;upports and backs his Indifference about the Exci&s;e, &s;o it takes off all Puni&s;hment from the Order whenever it happens.</P>
<P>I have known Numbers di&s;charged from the Exci&s;e, who would have been a Credit to their Patrons and the Employment, could they have found it worth their while to have attended to it. No Man enters into the Exci&s;e with any higher Expectations than a competent Mainte|nance; but not to find even that, can produce nothing but <HI>Coruption, Collu&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>Neglect.</HI></P>

<HEAD>REMARKS ON THE QUALIFICATIONS of OFFICERS.</HEAD>
<P>IN Employments where direct Labour only is wanting, and Tru&s;t quite out of the Que&s;tion, the Service is merely animal or mechanical.&mdash;In cutting a River, or forming a Road, as there is no Po&s;&s;ibility of Fraud, the Merit of Hone&s;ty is but of little Weight. Health, Strength, and Hardine&s;s, are the Labourers Virtues. But where Property depends on the Tru&s;t, and lies at the Di&s;cretion of the Servant, the Judgment of the Ma&s;ter takes a diffe|rent Channel, both in the Choice and the Wages. The Hone&s;t and the Di&s;&s;olute have here no Compari&s;on of Merit. A known Thief may be tru&s;ted to gather Stones: But a Steward ought to be Proof again&s;t the Temptations of uncounted Gold.</P>
<P>The Exci&s;e is &s;o far from being of the Nature of the fir&s;t, that it is all, and more, than can commonly be put together in the la&s;t: 'Tis a Place of <HI>Poverty, of Tru&s;t, of Opportunity, and Temptation.</HI> A Compound of Di&s;cords, where the more they harmonize, the more they offend. Ruin and Reconcilement are produced at once.</P>
<P>To be properly qualified for the Employment, it is not only nece&s;&s;ary that the Per&s;on &s;hould be hone&s;t, but that he
<PB N="19" REF="18">
be &s;ober, diligent, and &s;kilful: Sober, that he may be always capable of Bu&s;ine&s;s; diligent, that he may be al|ways in his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;kilful, that he may be able to prevent or detect Frauds again&s;t the Revenue. The Want of any of the&s;e Qualifications is a Capital Offence in the Exci&s;e. A Complaint of Drunkenne&s;s, Negli|gence, or Ignorance, is certain Death by the Laws of the Board. It cannot then be all Sorts of Per&s;ons who are proper for the Office. The very Notion of procuring a &s;ufficient Number for even le&s;s than the pre&s;ent Salary, is &s;o de&s;titute of every Degree of &s;ound Rea&s;on, that it needs no Reply. The Employment, from the In&s;uffi|ciency of the Salary, is <HI>already</HI> become &s;o incon&s;iderable in the general Opinion, that Per&s;ons of any Capacity or Reputation will keep out of it; for where is the Mecha|nic, or even the Labourer, who cannot earn at lea&s;t 1 s. 9 d. Farthing <HI>per</HI> Day? It certainly cannot be proper to take the Dregs of every Calling, and to make the Exci&s;e the common Receptacle for the Indigent, the Ignorant, and the Calamitous.</P>
<P>A truly worthy Commi&s;&s;ioner lately dead, made a pub|lic Offer a few Years ago, of putting any of his Neigh|bours Sons into the Exci&s;e; but though the Offer amounted almo&s;t to an Invitation, one only, whom &s;even Years Apprentice&s;hip could not make a Taylor, accepted it; who, after a Twelvemonth's In&s;truction, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ordered off, but in a few Days finding the Employment be|yond his Abilities, he prudently de&s;erted it, and returned Home, where he now remains in the Character of an Hu&s;bandman.</P>
<P>There are very few In&s;tances of Rejection even of Per|&s;ons who can &s;carce write their own Names legible; for as there is neither Law to compel, nor Encouragement to incite, no other can be had than &s;uch as offer, and none will offer who can &s;ee any other Pro&s;pect of Living. Every one knows that the Exci&s;e is a Place of Labour,
<PB N="20" REF="19">
not of Ea&s;e; of Hazard, not of Certainty; and that downright Poverty fini&s;hes the Character.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t &s;trike every con&s;iderate Mind to hear a Man with a large Family faithful enough to declare, that he cannot &s;upport him&s;elf on the Salary with that hone&s;t Independance he could wi&s;h. There is a great Degree of affecting Hone&s;ty in an ingenuous Confe&s;&s;ion. Eloquence may &s;trike the Ear, but the Language of Poverty &s;trikes the Heart; the fir&s;t may charm like Mu&s;ic, but the &s;e|cond alarms like a Knell.</P>
<P>Of late Years there has been &s;uch an Admi&s;&s;ion of im|proper and ill qualified Per&s;ons into the Exci&s;e, that the Office is not only become contemptible, but the Revenue in&s;ecure. Collectors, who&s;e long Services and Qualifi|cations have advanced them to that Station, are di&s;graced by the Wretchedne&s;s of new Supers continually. Cer|tainly &s;ome Regard ought to be had to Decency, as well as Merit.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the capital Evils which ari&s;e from the wretched Poverty of the Salary. Evils they certainly are; for what can be more de&s;tructive in a Revenue Office, than CORRUPTION, COLLUSION, NEGLECT, and ILL QUALIFICATIONS.</P>
<P>Should it be que&s;tioned whether an Augmentation of Salary would remove them, I an&s;wer, there is &s;carce a Doubt to be made of it. Human Wi&s;dom may po&s;&s;ibly be deceived in its wi&s;e&s;t De&s;igns; but here, every Thought and Circum&s;tance e&s;tabli&s;h the Hope. They are Evils of &s;uch a ruinous Tendency, that they mu&s;t, by &s;ome Means or other, be removed. Rigour and Severity have been tried in vain; for Puni&s;hment lo&s;es all its Force where Men expect and di&s;regard it.</P>
<P>Of late Years the Board of Exci&s;e has &s;hewn an ex|traordinary Tenderne&s;s in &s;uch In&s;tances as might other|wi&s;e have affected the Circum&s;tances of their Officers. Their Compa&s;&s;ion have greatly tended to le&s;&s;en the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es
<PB N="21" REF="20">
of the Employment: But as it cannot amount to a total Re|moval of them, the Officers of Exci&s;e throughout the Kingdom have (as the Voice of one Man) prepared Peti|tions to be laid before the Hon. Hou&s;e of Commons on the en&s;uing Parliament.</P>
<P>An Augmentation of Salary &s;ufficient to enable them to live hone&s;tly and competently, would produce more good Effect than all the Laws of the Land can enforce. The Generality of &s;uch Frauds as the Officers have been detected in, have appeared of a Nature as remote from in|herent Di&s;hone&s;ty, as a temporary Illne&s;s is from an in|curable Di&s;ea&s;e. Surrounded with <HI>Want, Children,</HI> and <HI>De&s;pair,</HI> what can the <HI>Hu&s;band</HI> or the <HI>Father</HI> do.&mdash;No Laws compel like Nature&mdash;No Connections bind like Blood.</P>
<P>With an Addition of Salary, the Exci&s;e would wear a new A&s;pect, and recover its former Con&s;titution. Lan|guor and Neglect would give Place to Care and Chearful|ne&s;s. Men of Reputation and Abilities would &s;eek after it, and finding a comfortable Maintenance, would &s;tick to it. The unworthy and the incapable would be re|jected; the Power of Superiors be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed; and Laws and In&s;tructions receive new Force. The Officers would be &s;ecured from the Temptations of Poverty, and the Revenue from the Evils of it; the Cure would be as exten&s;ive as the Complaint; and new Health out-root the pre&s;ent CORRUPTIONS.</P>
