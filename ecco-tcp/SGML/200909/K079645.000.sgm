<P>ABOUT the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the u&s;urpations of the church of Rome had ari&s;en to their greate&s;t height. That amazing &s;y&s;tem of &s;piritual tyranny had drawn within its influence, in a manner, the whole government of England. The haughty legate, &s;triding over law, made even the mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice tremble at his tribunal: parliaments were over-awed; and &s;overeigns obliged to temporize: while the lawle&s;s eccle&s;ia&s;tic, intrenched behind the authority of councils and decrees, &s;et at naught the civil power; and opened an a&s;y|lum to any, the mo&s;t profligate, di&s;turbers of &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="18">In the mean time the taxes gathered, under various pretences, by the agents of the conclave, exceeded, by above two thirds, the produce of the royal trea&s;ury: and when men con&s;idered how one claim after another had ari&s;en, and from &s;lender pretences had taken the forms of legal e&s;tabli&s;hments, they could not but be alarmed at an evil teeming with &s;uch ruin; and &s;aw delu&s;ion even through the gloom of ignorance. The peo|ple, in &s;pite of &s;uper&s;tition, cried out again&s;t &s;uch &s;candalous exactions; and the legi&s;la|ture began to think &s;eriou&s;ly of checking the&s;e enormities by re&s;olute laws.</P>
<P>The rapacity of the court of Rome fir&s;t &s;et the &s;u&s;picions of men afloat. The vota|ries of the church bore with temper to &s;ee the exten&s;ion of its power; and its advo|cates had always to obtrude upon the people the divine &s;anctions of its dominion; and could on that topic de&s;cant plau&s;ibly enough. But when this holy church, the &s;acred ob|ject of veneration, became immer&s;ed in temporal things; when it plainly appeared to be fully in&s;tructed in all the arts of gra&s;p|ing and &s;quandering, which were found among mere human beings, its mercenary
<PB N="3" REF="19">
views were evident; and &s;erious men were led to que&s;tion opinions, which came ac|companied by &s;uch unwarrantable practice.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on of any eminence, who e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of religious liberty, was John Wicliff. This reformer was born about the year 1324, in the reign of Edward II. Of his extraction we have no certain account. His parents de&s;igning him for the church, &s;ent him to Queen's-college in Oxford, then ju&s;t founded by Robert Eaglesfield, confe&s;&s;or to queen Philippa. But not meeting with the advantages for &s;tudy in that new-e&s;tabli&s;hed hou&s;e, which he expected, he re|moved to Merton-college; which was then e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t learned &s;ocieties in Europe.</P>
<P>Here he applied with &s;uch indu&s;try, that he is &s;aid to have gotten by heart the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e parts of the works of Ari&s;totle. The logic of that acute philo&s;opher &s;eems chiefly to have engaged his attention; in which he was &s;o conver&s;ant, that he became a mo&s;t &s;ubtile di&s;putant, and reigned in the &s;chools without a rival.</P>
<P>Thus prepared, he began next with divi|nity. The divinity of tho&s;e times corre&s;|ponded
<PB N="4" REF="20">
with the logic. What was farthe&s;t from rea&s;on, appeared mo&s;t like truth: at lea&s;t mo&s;t worth a &s;cholar's pur&s;uit. In that age flouri&s;hed tho&s;e eminent doctors, who mutually complimenting each other with &s;ounding titles, the profound, the angelic, and the &s;eraphic, drew upon them&s;elves the reverence of their own times, and the con|tempt of all po&s;terity. Wicliff's attention was a while engaged in this fa&s;hionable &s;tudy; in which he became &s;o thorough a proficient, that he was ma&s;ter of all the niceties of that &s;trange jargon, which is commonly called &s;chool-divinity.</P>
<P>His good &s;en&s;e, however, &s;eems to have freed him early from the &s;hackles of autho|rity and fa&s;hion. He &s;aw the unprofitable|ne&s;s of &s;uch &s;tudies; and having been mi&s;led, rather than bewildered, he di&s;engaged him|&s;elf from them without much difficulty.</P>
<P>From this time he &s;eems to have chalked out for him&s;elf a &s;impler path. He took the naked text of &s;cripture into his hands, and became his own annotator. The writ|ings of the &s;choolmen, he &s;oon found, were calculated only to make &s;ectaries; the bible alone to make a rational chri&s;tian. Hence
<PB N="5" REF="21">
he attained that noble freedom of thought, which was afterwards &s;o con&s;picuous in all his writings; and among his contemporaries was rewarded, after the fa&s;hion of the times, with the title of the evangelic doctor.</P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;tudies he added that of the civil and canon law; and is &s;aid al&s;o to have been well ver&s;ed in the municipal laws of his country.</P>
<P>In the mean time his reputation increa&s;ed with his knowledge: and he was re&s;pected not only as an able &s;cholar, but e&s;teemed as a &s;erious and pious man; a &s;incere en|quirer after truth; and a &s;teady maintainer of it when di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing, which drew upon him the public eye, was his defence of the uni|ver&s;ity again&s;t the begging friars. The affair was this.</P>
<P>The&s;e religious, from the time of their fir&s;t &s;ettlement in Oxford, which was in the year 1230, had been very trouble&s;ome neighbours to the univer&s;ity. They &s;et up a different intere&s;t, aimed at a di&s;tinct juri&s;|diction, fomented feuds between the &s;cholars and their &s;uperiors, and in many other re&s;|pects became &s;uch offen&s;ive inmates, that
<PB N="6" REF="22">
the univer&s;ity was obliged to curb their li|centiou&s;ne&s;s by &s;evere &s;tatutes. This in&s;o|lent behaviour on one &s;ide, and the oppo&s;i|tion it met with on the other, laid the foun|dation of an endle&s;s quarrel. The friars appealed to the pope; the &s;cholars to the civil power: and &s;ometimes one party, and &s;ometimes the other prevailed. Thus the cau&s;e became general; and an oppo&s;ition to the friars was looked upon as the te&s;t of a young fellow's affection to the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>It happened, while things were in this &s;ituation, that the friars had gotten among them a notion, of which they were exceed|ingly fond; that Chri&s;t was a common beg|gar; that his di&s;ciples were beggars al&s;o; and that begging, by their example, was of go&s;pel-in&s;titution. This notion they pro|pagated with great zeal from all the pulpits, both in Oxford, and the neighbourhood, to which they had acce&s;s.</P>
<P>Wicliff, who had long held the&s;e religi|ous in great contempt, on account of the lazine&s;s of their lives, thought he had now found a fair occa&s;ion to expo&s;e them. He drew up therefore, and pre&s;ently publi&s;hed, a treati&s;e <HI>Again&s;t able beggary;</HI> in which he
<PB N="7" REF="23">
fir&s;t &s;hewed the difference between the po|verty of Chri&s;t and that of the friars, and the obligations which all chri&s;tians lay un|der to labour in &s;ome way for the good of &s;ociety. He then la&s;hed the friars with great acrimony, proving them to be an in|famous and u&s;ele&s;s &s;et of men, wallowing in luxury; and &s;o far from being objects of charity, that they were a reproach not only to religion, but even to human &s;ociety. This piece was calculated for the many, on whom it made a great impre&s;&s;ion. At the &s;ame time it increa&s;ed his reputation with the learned; all men of &s;en&s;e and freedom admiring the work, and applauding the &s;pirit of the author.</P>
<P>From this time the univer&s;ity began to con&s;ider him as one of her fir&s;t champions; and in con&s;equence of the reputation he had gained, he was &s;oon afterwards promoted to the ma&s;ter&s;hip of Baliol-college.</P>
<P>About this time, archbi&s;hop I&s;lip, founded Canterbury-hall in Oxford, where he e&s;ta|bli&s;hed a warden, and eleven &s;cholars. The warden's name was Wodehall; who with three of his &s;cholars were monks; the re&s;t were &s;ecular. The prudent archbi&s;hop, un|willing
<PB N="8" REF="24">
to irritate either &s;ide, cho&s;e in this way to divide his favours. Wodehall, though brought from a di&s;tant mona&s;tery, ru&s;hed immediately into the quarrel, which he found &s;ub&s;i&s;ting at Oxford; and having vexed the unhappy &s;eculars incorporated with him, by every method in his power, he became next a public di&s;turber; and made it his particular employment to rai&s;e and foment animo&s;ities in colleges, and di&s;|putes in the convocation. The archbi&s;hop, hearing of his behaviour, and finding the report well-grounded, apologized to the univer&s;ity for placing among them &s;o trouble|&s;ome a man; and immediately ejected both him, and the three regulars, his a&s;&s;ociates. The primate's next care was to appoint a proper &s;ucce&s;&s;or: and in this view he applied to Wicliff, whom he was greatly de&s;irous of placing at the head of his new founda|tion. Wicliff, whether through an inclina|tion to cultivate the archbi&s;hop's acquain|tance, or to put in order a new-e&s;tabli&s;hed hou&s;e, accepted the propo&s;al, and was im|mediately cho&s;en warden of Canterbury-hall.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="25">But his new dignity &s;oon involved him in difficulties. He was &s;carce e&s;tabli&s;hed in it, when the archbi&s;hop died, and was &s;uc|ceeded by Simon Langham, bi&s;hop of Ely. This prelate had &s;pent his life in a cloy&s;ter, having been fir&s;t a monk, and afterwards an abbot. The ejected regulars failed not to take advantage of &s;o favourable an oppor|tunity; and made in&s;tant application to the new archbi&s;hop, expecting every thing from a man whom they imagined &s;o well inclined to their order. Their expectations were ju&s;tly founded. Langham e&s;pou&s;ed their cau&s;e with great readine&s;s; ejected Wicliff, and the regulars his companions; and &s;eque&s;tered their revenues.</P>
<P>So flagrant a piece of inju&s;tice, rai&s;ed a general out-cry. <Q>If the very act of a founder might be thus &s;et a&s;ide by a pri|vate per&s;on, how precarious was college-preferment!</Q> In &s;hort, Wicliff was ad|vi&s;ed by his friends to appeal to the pope; who dur&s;t not, they told him, countenance &s;o injurious a proceeding. Urban fore&s;eeing &s;ome difficulty in the affair, prudently &s;tep|ed behind the curtain, and commi&s;&s;ioned a cardinal to examine it. The archbi&s;hop be|ing
<PB N="10" REF="26">
cited put in his plea; and each &s;ide accu&s;ed and an&s;wered by turns, protracting the bu&s;ine&s;s into great length.</P>
<P>While this matter was in agitation, an affair happened, which brought it to a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion. Edward the III. who was now king of England, had for &s;ome time withdrawn the tribute, which his pre|dece&s;&s;ors, from the time of king John, had paid to the pope. The pope menaced in his u&s;ual language: but he had a prince to deal with of too high a &s;pirit to be &s;o intimi|dated. Edward called a parliament, laid the affair before them, and de&s;ired their advice. The parliament without much de|bating re&s;olved, that king John had done an illegal thing, and had given up the rights of the nation: at the &s;ame time they advi&s;ed the king by no means to &s;ubmit to the pope; and promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him to the utmo&s;t of their power, if the affair &s;hould bring on con&s;equences.</P>
<P>While the parliament was thus calling in que&s;tion the pope's authority, the clergy, e&s;pecially the regulars, &s;hewed their zeal by &s;peaking and writing in his defence. His undoubted right to his revenue was their
<PB N="11" REF="27">
&s;ubject; which they proved by a variety of arguments, drawn from the divinity, and adapted to the genius of tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>Among others who li&s;ted them&s;elves in this cau&s;e, a monk, of more learning, and of a more liberal turn of thought than com|mon, publi&s;hed a treati&s;e, written in a very &s;pirited and plau&s;ible manner. His argu|ments met with many advocates, and help|ed to keep the minds of the people in &s;u&s;|pence. Wicliff, who&s;e indignation was rai&s;|ed at &s;eeing &s;o bad a cau&s;e &s;o well defended, undertook to oppo&s;e the monk, and did it in &s;o ma&s;terly a way, that he was no longer con&s;idered as unan&s;werable.</P>
<P>Soon after this book was publi&s;hed, the &s;uit at Rome was determined again&s;t him: and when men &s;aw an effect corre&s;ponding &s;o exactly with a probable cau&s;e, they could not avoid a&s;&s;igning that probable cau&s;e, as a real one. In a word, nobody doubted but his oppo&s;ition to the pope, at &s;o critical a time, was the true cau&s;e of his being non-&s;uited at Rome.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding his di&s;appointment, Wic|liff &s;till continued at Oxford; where his friends, about this time, procured him a
<PB N="12" REF="28">
benefice. Soon after, the divinity profe&s;&s;or's chair falling vacant, he took a doctor's de|gree, and was elected into it, the univer&s;ity paying him this compliment, not only as the reward of his merit, but as a compen&s;a|tion for his lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Dr. Wicliff had now attained the &s;ummit of his hopes. His &s;tation afforded him that opportunity, which he wanted, of throw|ing &s;ome new lights, as he imagined, upon religious &s;ubjects. A long cour&s;e of rea&s;on|ing had now fully convinced him, that the Romi&s;h religion was a &s;y&s;tem of errors. The &s;candalous lives of the mona&s;tic clergy fir&s;t led him into this train of thinking; and an inquiry into antiquity had confirmed him in it. But it was a bold undertaking to encounter errors of &s;o long a &s;tanding; errors, which had taken &s;o deep a root, and had &s;pread them&s;elves &s;o wide. The un|dertaking at lea&s;t required the greate&s;t cau|tion. He re&s;olved therefore at fir&s;t to go on with the popular argument, which he had begun, and continue his attack upon the mona&s;tic clergy.</P>
<P>It was a circum&s;tance in his favour, that the begging friars were at this time in the
<PB N="13" REF="29">
highe&s;t di&s;credit at Oxford. The occa&s;ional oppo&s;ition he had already given them, had by no means hurt his reputation; and as he really thought the mona&s;tic clergy, the prin|cipal in&s;truments of the prevailing corrup|tion, he was fully determined not to &s;pare them. In his public lectures therefore he repre&s;ented them as a &s;et of men, who pro|fe&s;&s;ed indeed to live under the rule of holy &s;aints, but had now &s;o far degenerated from their fir&s;t in&s;titution, that they were become a &s;candal to their founders. Men might well cry out, he &s;aid, again&s;t the decay of religion; but he could &s;hew them from whence this decay proceeded. While the preachers of religion never inculcated religi|ous duties, but entertained the people with idle &s;tories, and lying miracles; while they never inforced the nece&s;&s;ity of a good life, but taught their hearers to put their tru&s;t in a bit of &s;ealed parchment, and the prayers of hypocrites, it was impo&s;&s;ible, he &s;aid, but religion mu&s;t decay. Such treacherous friends did more hurt than open enemies.&mdash; But a regard for religion, he added, was not to be expected from them: they had nothing in view but the advancement of
<PB N="14" REF="30">
their order. In every age they had made it their practice to invent, and multiply &s;uch new opinions and doctrines as &s;uited their avaritious views: nay they had, in a manner, &s;et a&s;ide chri&s;tianity, by binding men with their traditions in preference to the rule of Chri&s;t, who, it might well be &s;uppo&s;ed, left nothing u&s;eful out of his &s;cheme.</P>
<P>In &s;uch language did Dr. Wicliff inveigh again&s;t the mona&s;tic clergy; and opened the eyes of men to a variety of abu&s;es, which were before hidden in the darkne&s;s of &s;uper|&s;tition.</P>
<P>He had not, however, yet avowedly que&s;ti|oned any doctrine of the church. All he had hitherto attempted was to loo&s;en the pre|judices of the vulgar. His &s;ucce&s;s in this, warranted a further progre&s;s; and he began next to think of attacking &s;ome of the fun|damentals of popery.</P>
<P>In this de&s;ign he &s;till proceeded with his u&s;ual caution. At fir&s;t, he thought it &s;uffi|cient to lead his adver&s;aries into logical and metaphy&s;ical di&s;putations; accu&s;toming them to hear novelties, and to bear contradiction. Nothing pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;chools but learned arguments on the form of things, on the
<PB N="15" REF="31">
increa&s;e of time, on &s;pace, &s;ub&s;tance, and identity. In the&s;e di&s;putations he artfully intermixed, and pu&s;hed as far as he dur&s;t, new opinions in divinity; &s;ounding, as it were, the minds of his hearers. At length, finding he had a great party in the &s;chools, and that he was li&s;tened to with attention, he ven|tured to be more explicit, and by degrees opened him&s;elf at large.</P>
<P>He began by invalidating all the writings of the fathers after the tenth century. At that time, he &s;aid, an age of darkne&s;s and error commenced; and the hone&s;t enquirer after truth could never &s;atisfy him&s;elf among the opinions and doctrines, which then took their birth.</P>
<P>The &s;peculative corruptions, which had crept into religion were the fir&s;t &s;ubject of his enquiry. Many of the&s;e he traced out, from their earlie&s;t origin; and with egrat accuracy and acutene&s;s &s;hewed the progre&s;s they had made, as they de&s;cended through the ages of &s;uper&s;tition. He proceeded next to the u&s;urpations of the court of Rome. On this &s;ubject he was very copious: it was his favourite topic; and &s;eldom failed, however coolly he might begin, to give him
<PB N="16" REF="32">
warmth and &s;pirit as he proceeded. On the&s;e, and many other &s;ubjects of the &s;ame kind, he in&s;i&s;ted with great freedom, and a &s;trength of rea&s;oning far &s;uperior to the learn|ing of tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>This &s;pirited attack upon the church of Rome hath been attributed by his enemies to motives of re&s;entment. His deprivation, it is &s;aid, was the unlucky cau&s;e of all this heat and bitterne&s;s. And indeed his con|duct, in this in&s;tance, hath unque&s;tionably the appearance of being influenced by his pa&s;&s;ions. But the candid of all parties will be very cautions in a&s;&s;igning motives; and the friends of Wicliff may with truth re|mon&s;trate, that he began his attack upon the church of Rome, before he had been injured by the pope. They may add too, that he never before had &s;o proper an occa|&s;ion to que&s;tion publickly the erroneous tenets of religion.</P>
<P>From whatever motives however, this &s;pirited attack proceeded, we are not &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find a violent clamour rai&s;ed again&s;t him by the romi&s;h clergy. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, taking the lead, re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute him with the utmo&s;t vigour. But
<PB N="17" REF="33">
here&s;y was a new crime: the church had &s;lept in its errors through &s;o many ages, that it was unprepared for an attack. Records however were &s;earched, and precedents ex|amined; till, with &s;ome difficulty, at length Dr. Wicliff was deprived and &s;ilenced.</P>
<P>Edward III. after a glorious, and active reign, was, at this time, too much impaired both in body and mind, to bear the fatigues of government. The whole admini&s;tration of affairs was in the hands of his &s;on the duke of Lanca&s;ter, commonly known by the name of John of Ghent.</P>
<P>This prince had a &s;pirit an&s;werable to his birth, and pre&s;erved the forms of royalty as much as any monarch of his time. He had violent pa&s;&s;ions, of which his enemies and friends were equally &s;en&s;ible. In reli|gion he had free notions; and whether his creed gave offence to the popi&s;h clergy; or whether he had made &s;ome efforts to curb the exorbitance of their power, it is certain they were vehemently incen&s;ed again&s;t him; and &s;ome of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is particularly charged upon William of Wickham, Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; but a late very accurate and inge|nious writer hath &s;ufficiently exculpated him on this head.</NOTE> the leading churchmen, it
<PB N="18" REF="34">
is &s;aid, had u&s;ed very ba&s;e arts to blacken his character. With equal fire the duke retort|ed their ill-treatment; and having long de&s;|pi&s;ed them, and being now &s;o exceedingly provoked, he conceived a &s;ettled prejudice again&s;t the whole order; and endeavoured by all the means in his power to bring them into the &s;ame contempt with others, in which he held them him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This quarrel between the duke of Lan|ca&s;ter and the clergy, was the occa&s;ion of introducing Dr. Wicliff into public life; and this introduction afforded him afterwards an opportunity of &s;ignalizing him&s;elf &s;till more in the great cau&s;e of religious liberty. The duke, it &s;eems, had heard with plea&s;ure, of the attack he had made upon the church of Rome; and had waited the con&s;equences of it with great attention: and when he now found, that Dr. Wicliff was likely to be the &s;ufferer, he interpo&s;ed, re&s;cued him out of the hands of his enemies, who were per&s;u|ing their advantage, and brought him to court; where, through a pa&s;&s;ionate vibration of temper, from one extreme to another, he took him into his confidence, and treated
<PB N="19" REF="35">
him with a kindne&s;s proportioned to the en|mity which he bore the clergy.</P>
<P>The oppre&s;&s;ions of the court of Rome were, at this time, &s;everely felt in England. Many things were complained of; but nothing more than the &s;tate of church-preferments; almo&s;t all of which, and even rectories, and vicarages of any value, in whom&s;oever origi|nally ve&s;ted, were now, through one fiction or another, claimed by the pope. With the&s;e he pen&s;ioned his friends and favourites; mo&s;t of whom, being foreigners, re&s;ided a|broad; and left their benefices in the hands of ill-paid, and negligent curates. By the&s;e means religion decayed; the country was drained of money; and what was looked upon as mo&s;t vexatious, a body of in&s;olent tythe-gatherers were &s;et over the people, who had their own fortunes to make out of the &s;urplus of their exactions.</P>
<P>The&s;e hard&s;hips, notwith&s;tanding the blind obedience paid at that time to the &s;ee of Rome, created great unquietne&s;s. The na|tion &s;aw it&s;elf wronged; and parliamentary petitions, in very warm language, were pre|ferred to the conclave: but to little purpo&s;e; the pope lending a very negligent ear to any
<PB N="20" REF="36">
motion which &s;o nearly affected his re|venue.</P>
<P>The duke of Lanca&s;ter, however, at this time, though the nation had now complain|ed in vain during more than 30 years, was determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to obtain redre&s;s. And, in the fir&s;t place, to open the eyes of the people in the mo&s;t effectual manner, he obliged all bi&s;hops to &s;end in li&s;ts of the num|ber and value of &s;uch preferments and bene|fices in each of their dioce&s;&s;es, as were in the hands of foreigners. From the&s;e li&s;ts it appeared what immen&s;e &s;ums, in that one way, were conveyed every year out of the kingdom.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep taken was to &s;end an em|ba&s;&s;y to the pope to treat of the liberties of the church of England; at the head of which emba&s;&s;y were the bi&s;hop of Bangor, and Dr. Wicliff. They were met at Bruges, on the part of Rome, by the bi&s;hops of Pampelone and Semigaglia, and the provo&s;t of Valenza. The&s;e agents, practi&s;ed in the policy of their court, &s;pun out the negotiation with great dexterity; &s;ome hi&s;torians mention the con|tinuance of it during the &s;pace of two years. The romi&s;h amba&s;&s;adors however, finding
<PB N="21" REF="37">
them&s;elves hard pre&s;&s;ed by their antagoni&s;ts; and prudently con&s;idering, that it would be ea&s;ier to evade a treaty when made, than in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances not to make one, determined at la&s;t to bring matters to a con|clu&s;ion. Accordingly it was agreed, that the pope &s;hould no longer di&s;po&s;e of any be|nefices belonging to the church of England. No mention was made of bi&s;hopricks: this was thought a voluntary omi&s;&s;ion in the bi&s;hop of Bangor; and men the rather be|lieved &s;o, when they &s;aw him twice after|wards tran&s;lated by the pope's authority.</P>
<P>But though Dr. Wicliff failed in his en|deavours to &s;erve his country by this treaty, (for indeed it was never ob&s;erved) he made his journey however of &s;ome &s;ervice to him|&s;elf. It was his great care to u&s;e the oppor|tunity it afforded him of &s;ifting out the real de&s;igns of the court of Rome, not only in this affair, but in all its other negotiations: he inquired into the ends it had in view, and the means it employed: and by frequent conver&s;ations with the amba&s;&s;adors upon the&s;e &s;ubjects, he penetrated &s;o far into the con&s;titution and policy of that corrupt court, that he began to think of it in a much har&s;her

manner than he had ever yet done, and to be more convinced of its avarice and ambi|tion. Prejudiced as he had long been again&s;t its doctrines and mini&s;try, he had never yet thought &s;o ill of its de&s;igns.</P>
<P>Thus influenced, when he came home, we find him inveighing in his lectures again&s;t the church of Rome, in warmer language than he had hitherto u&s;ed. The exemp|tion of the clergy from the juri&s;diction of the civil power was one of his topics of in|vective: the u&s;e of &s;anctuaries was another: indulgences a third: in &s;hort there has &s;carce been a corrupt principle or practice in the Roman church, detected by later ages, which his penetration had not at that early day di&s;|covered; and though his rea&s;onings want much of that acutene&s;s and &s;trength, with which the be&s;t writers of the&s;e times have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed tho&s;e &s;ubjects; yet when we con&s;i|der the uninlightened age in which he lived, we rather &s;tand a&s;toni&s;hed at that force of genius, which carried him &s;o far, than in any degree wonder at his not going farther.</P>
<P>The pope him&s;elf was often the &s;ubject of his invective: his infallibility, his u&s;urpati|ons, his pride, his avarice, and his tyranny,
<PB N="23" REF="39" MS="y">
were his frequent theme; and indeed his lan|guage was never warmer than when on the&s;e topics. The celebrated epithet of <HI>antichri&s;t,</HI> which in after ages, was &s;o liberally be&s;tow|ed upon the pope, &s;eems to have been fir&s;t given him by this reformer.</P>
<P>The pomp and luxury of bi&s;hops he would frequently la&s;h; and would a&s;k the people, when they &s;aw their prelates riding abroad accompanied with four&s;core hor&s;emen in &s;ilver trappings, whether they perceived any re&s;emblance between &s;uch &s;plendor, and the &s;implicity of primitive bi&s;hops?</P>
<P>Where the&s;e lectures were read, does not certainly appear. It is mo&s;t probable how|ever, that they were read in Oxford; where Dr. Wicliff &s;eems by this time to have reco|vered his former &s;tation, and where he had &s;till a con&s;iderable party in his favour.</P>
<P>In the mean time he was frequently at court, where he continued in great credit with the duke of Lanca&s;ter. Many indeed expected, &s;ome high preferment in the church was intended for him; but we meet with no account of his having had the offer of any &s;uch, whether he him&s;elf declined it, or the duke thought an eminent &s;tation in the
<PB N="24" REF="40">
church would only the more expo&s;e him to the malice of his enemies. The duke how|ever took care to make him independent by conferring a good benefice upon him, the rectory of Lutterworth in Leice&s;ter&s;hire; whither he immediately repaired, and &s;et him&s;elf faithfully to di&s;charge the duties of it. We hear nothing more of his other bene|fice, &s;o that it is probable he gave it up when he accepted Lutterworth.</P>
<P>Dr. Wicliff was &s;carce &s;ettled in his pari&s;h, when his enemies, taking the advantage of his retirement, began to per&s;ecute him again with fre&s;h vigour. At the head of this per|&s;ecution were Sudbury, archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, and Courtney, bi&s;hop of London. The former was a man of uncommon mo|deration for the times in which he lived; the latter was an inflamed bigot. The arch|bi&s;hop indeed &s;eems to have been pre&s;&s;ed in|to this &s;ervice; to which he afforded only the countenance of his name. Courtney, took upon him&s;elf the management of it; and having procured proper letters from Rome, Dr. Wicliff was cited to appear be|fore him on a day fixed, at St. Paul's in London.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="41">This was an unexpected &s;ummons to Dr. Wicliff; who imagined probably that the ob&s;curity of his retreat would have &s;creened him from his enemies. He repaired how|ever, immediately to the duke of Lanca&s;ter, to con&s;ult with him on a bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch im|portance. The duke did what he could to avert the pro&s;ecution; but finding him&s;elf unable to oppo&s;e a force compo&s;ed of little le&s;s than the whole eccle&s;ia&s;tical order, he thought it more probable that he &s;hould be able to protect his friend from the future con&s;equences of the clergy's malice, than to &s;creen him from the pre&s;ent effects of it. Determined however, to give him what countenance he could, he attended him in per&s;on to his trial; and engaged al&s;o the lord Piercy, earl-mar&s;hal of England, to accom|pany them.</P>
<P>When they came to St. Paul's, they found the court &s;itting, and a very great croud a&s;|&s;embled, through which the earl-mar&s;hal made u&s;e of his authority to gain an entrance.</P>
<P>The arrival of &s;uch per&s;onages, with their attendants, occa&s;ioned no little di&s;turbance in the church; and the bi&s;hop of London, piqued to &s;ee Dr. Wicliff &s;o attended, told
<PB N="26" REF="42">
the earl with a peevi&s;h air, that if he had known before what di&s;turbance he would have made, he &s;hould have been &s;topped at the door. He was greatly offended al&s;o at the duke for in&s;i&s;ting that Dr. Wicliff &s;hould &s;it during his trial; and let fall &s;ome expre&s;&s;i|ons, which that haughty prince was ill able to bear. He immediately fired; and re|proached the bi&s;hop with great bitterne&s;s. Warm language en&s;ued. The prelate how|ever, had the advantage; of which the duke &s;eeming con&s;cious, from railing began to threaten; and looking di&s;dainfully at the bi&s;hop, told him, that he would bring down the pride, not only of him, but of all the prelacy of England: and turning to a per&s;on near him, he &s;aid in a half whi&s;per, that rather than take &s;uch u&s;age from the bi&s;hop, he would pull him by the hair of his head out of the church. The&s;e words being caught up by &s;ome, who &s;tood near, were &s;pread among the croud, and in an in&s;tant threw the whole a&s;&s;embly into a ferment; voices from every part being heard, united in one general cry, that their bi&s;hop &s;hould not be &s;o u&s;ed, and that they would &s;tand by him to their la&s;t breath. In &s;hort, the confu&s;ion
<PB N="27" REF="43">
aro&s;e to &s;uch an height, that all bu&s;ine&s;s was at an end, the whole was di&s;order, and the court broke up without having taken any &s;tep of con&s;equence in the affair.</P>
<P>The tumult however did not &s;o end. The duke, agitated by his pa&s;&s;ions, went di|rectly to the hou&s;e of peers; where inveigh|ing again&s;t the riotous di&s;po&s;ition of the Lon|doners, he preferred a bill, that very day, to deprive the city of London of its privileges, and to alter the juri&s;diction of it.</P>
<P>The city of London was never more moved than on this occa&s;ion. The heads of it met in con&s;ultation; while the populace a&s;&s;embled in a riot, and a&s;&s;aulted the hou&s;es of the duke, and the earl mar&s;hal, who both left the city with precipitation.</P>
<P>The&s;e tumults, which continued &s;ome time, put a &s;top to all proceedings again&s;t Wicliff; nor indeed do we find him in any farther trouble, during the remainder of king Edward's reign.</P>
<P>In the year 1377 that prince died, and was &s;ucceeded by his grand&s;on Richard II. Rich|ard being only eleven years of age, the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of the parliament was to &s;ettle a re|gency. The duke of Lanca&s;ter a&s;pired to
<PB N="28" REF="44">
be &s;ole regent; but the parliament thought otherwi&s;e: much was apprehended from the violence of his temper; and more from his unpopular maxims of government. The re|gency therefore was put into commi&s;&s;ion, and he had only one voice in the manage|ment of affairs.</P>
<P>The duke of Lanca&s;ter's fall from his for|mer height of power was a &s;ignal to the bi|&s;hops to begin anew their per&s;ecution again&s;t Wicliff. Articles of accu&s;ation were imme|diately drawn up, and di&s;patched to Rome. How very heartily the pope engaged in this bu&s;ine&s;s may be imagined, from his &s;ending upon this occa&s;ion not fewer than five bulls into England: of the&s;e, three were directed to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and the bi|&s;hop of London; a fourth to the univer&s;ity of Oxford; and a fifth to the king.</P>
<P>Together with his bulls to the bi&s;hops, he &s;ent a copy of the heretical articles; requi|ring tho&s;e prelates to inform them&s;eives, whe|ther Wicliff really held the doctrines there|in contained; and, if he did, forthwith to impri&s;on him; or if they failed in that, to cite him to make his per&s;onal appearance at Rome within three months.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="45">In his bull to the chancellor, and other heads of the univer&s;iy, he expo&s;tulates with &s;ome warmth upon their &s;uffering tares to &s;pring up with the wheat, and even to grow ripe without rooting them out. It gives him great unea&s;ine&s;s, he &s;ays, that this evil was publicly &s;poken of at Rome, before any re|medy had been applied in England. He bids them con&s;ider the con&s;equences of Wic|liff's doctrines; that they tended to nothing le&s;s than the &s;ubver&s;ion both of church and &s;tate: and injoins them la&s;tly, to forbid the preaching of &s;uch tenets for the future with|in their di&s;tricts; and to a&s;&s;i&s;t the bi&s;hops in bringing Wicliff to condign puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>To the king he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in very obliging language; and exhorted him to &s;hew his zeal for the faith, and the holy &s;ee, by giving his countenance to the pro&s;ecution commencing again&s;t Wicliff.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e bulls the pope had little doubt. The court of Rome had never been accu&s;tomed to contradiction. De&s;potic in all its commands, it had only to dictate, and the proude&s;t monarch was ready to obey. But a new &s;cene of things was now open|ing; and a more liberal &s;pirit taking po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="30" REF="46">
of the minds of men. It mu&s;t have been a &s;en&s;ible mortification to the haughty pontiff, to &s;ee the neglect with which he was treated on this occa&s;ion. Oppo&s;ition to his exactions he had &s;ometimes found before; but this was the fir&s;t occa&s;ion, on which he had ever been treated with contempt. The univer&s;ity deliberated, whether it &s;hould even receive his bull; and by what appears it did not. And the regency were &s;o little di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew him any reverence, that they joined with the parliament at this very time, in giving a &s;ignal in&s;tance of their confidence in Dr. Wicliff, as if on purpo&s;e to make their contempt as notorious as po&s;&s;ible. The in&s;tance was this.</P>
<P>A truce with France at this juncture ex|piring, that nation took the advantage of a minority, and was making mighty prepara|tions to invade England. As the country was far from being in a po&s;ture of defence, all the money that could be rai&s;ed was want|ed. The parliament deliberating about the means, it was debated in the hou&s;e, whe|ther, upon an emergency, the money col|lected in England for the u&s;e of the pope, might not be applyed to the &s;ervice of the
<PB N="31" REF="47">
nation. The expediency of the mea&s;ure was acknowledged by all, but the legality of it was doubted. At la&s;t it was agreed both by the regency and the parliament, to put the que&s;tion to Dr. Wicliff. It appears as if they only wanted the authority of an able ca&s;ui&s;t to give a &s;anction to a re&s;olution already made; a &s;anction very ea&s;ily obtain|ed from the ca&s;ui&s;t they con&s;ulted.</P>
<P>But whatever di&s;re&s;pect was paid to the pope's bulls by the king and the univer&s;ity of Oxford, the zeal of the bi&s;hops made ample amends. The bi&s;hop of London e&s;pecially complyed not only with the letter, but en|tered into the &s;pirit of the pontiff's mandate.</P>
<P>He had taken however only the fir&s;t &s;tep in this bu&s;ine&s;s, when he received a peremp|tory order from the duke of Lanca&s;ter, not to proceed to impri&s;onment. To impri&s;on a man for holding an opinion, the duke told him, could not be ju&s;tified by the laws of England; he took the liberty therefore to inform him, that if he proceeded to any &s;uch extremity, he mu&s;t abide the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>This menace alarmed the bi&s;hop: he dropt the de&s;ign of an impri&s;onment; and con|tented him&s;elf with citing Wicliff to make
<PB N="32" REF="48">
his appearance, on &s;uch a day, before a pro|vincial &s;ynod in the chapel at Lambeth; &s;ending him at the &s;ame time a copy of the articles, which had been objected to, and de|&s;iring his explanation of them.</P>
<P>On the day appointed Dr. Wicliff appear|ed; and being que&s;tioned about the articles, he delivered in a paper, which explained the &s;en&s;e, in which he held them.</P>
<P>It would be tedious to tran&s;cribe this col|lection of antiquated opinions; many of which, at this day, would &s;eem of very lit|tle importance. The curious reader may &s;ee them at large in the fir&s;t volume of Fox's acts and monuments. We cannot however avoid ob&s;erving, that Dr. Wicliff by no means ap|pears in the mo&s;t favourable light on this oc|ca&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ingenious Mr. Hume, alluding to this pa&s;&s;age of his life, tells us, that <Q>Wicliff, notwith&s;tanding his enthu|&s;ia&s;m, &s;eems not to have been actuated by the &s;pirit of martyrdom; and in all &s;ub&s;equent trials before the pre|lates, he &s;o explained away his doctrine by tortured mean|ings, as to render it quite innocent and inoffen&s;ive.</Q> Mr. Hume's cen&s;ure, without que&s;tion, hath &s;ome founda|tion in hi&s;tory; which affords in this in&s;tance a very good handle to any one, who is glad of an opportunity of tra|ducing the memory of the reformer.</NOTE>. He explains many of the articles
<PB N="33" REF="49">
in a forced, unnatural manner, with much art, and in a very unmanly &s;train of com|pliment. On the other hand, it mu&s;t not be concealed, that his advocates call in que&s;tion the authenticity of this explanation; and have at lea&s;t to &s;ay for them&s;elves, that it is &s;olely conveyed down through the channel of popi&s;h writers.</P>
<P>While the bi&s;hops were deliberating upon Wicliff's confe&s;&s;ion, which (however cauti|ou&s;ly worded) was far, it &s;eems, from being &s;atisfactory, (an argument, by the way, a|gain&s;t the authenticity of that confe&s;&s;ion, which is handed down to us) the people both within doors, and without, grew very tu|multuous, crying aloud, that they would &s;uffer no violence to be done to Wicliff.</P>
<P>At this juncture Sir Lewis Clifford, a gen|tleman about the court, entered the chapel, and in an authoritative manner forbidding the bi&s;hops to proceed to any definitive &s;entence, retired. Sir Lewis was very well known to many there pre&s;ent; and the bi&s;hops taking it for granted, that he came properly autho|rized, (which yet does not appear) were in &s;ome confu&s;ion at the me&s;&s;age. The tumult at the door, in the mean time increa&s;ing,
<PB N="34" REF="50">
and adding to their perplexity, at length they di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;embly; having forbidden Dr. Wicliff to preach any more tho&s;e doctrines which had been objected to him. To this prohibition, it &s;eems, he paid little re&s;pect; going about barefooted, as we are informed, in a long frieze-gown, preaching every where occa&s;ionally to the people, and without any re&s;erve in his own pari&s;h. His zeal, it is probable, might now break out with the greater warmth, as he might tax his late be|haviour, if the account we have is genuine, with the want of proper freedom.</P>
<P>In the year 1378, pope Gregory the XIth died, and was &s;ucceeded by the archbi&s;hop of Barri, a Neapolitan, who took upon him the name of Urban VI. This pontiff, a man of an haughty temper, began his reign in &s;o arbitrary a manner, that he alienated from him the affections of his &s;ubjects. The car|dinals in particular &s;o highly re&s;ented his be|haviour, that a majority of them re&s;olved to run any lengths rather than bear it longer. They found therefore, or pretended to find, &s;ome flaw in his election; and a&s;&s;embling at Avignon, where the popes had often re&s;ided, they declared the election of Urban void, and
<PB N="35" REF="51">
cho&s;e Clement VII. This was a pa&s;&s;ionate mea&s;ure; and produced, as pa&s;&s;ionate mea|&s;ures generally do, de&s;tructive con&s;equences. The two popes, laying an equal claim to St. Peter's chair, began to &s;trengthen their re|&s;pective parties; their quarrel immediately became the cau&s;e of God, found adherents in all parts of Europe, occa&s;ioned deluges of blood, and gave a more fatal blow to popery than any thing had yet done.</P>
<P>Dr. Wicliff, it may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, was among tho&s;e, who took mo&s;t offence at this unchri&s;tian &s;chi&s;m. He con&s;idered it as a new argument again&s;t popery; and as &s;uch he failed not to u&s;e it. A tract &s;oon appear|ed in his name again&s;t the &s;chi&s;m of the Roman pontiffs, in which he &s;hewed what little credit was due to either of the contend|ing parties. This tract was eagerly read by all &s;orts of people, and tended not a little to open the eyes of the vulgar.</P>
<P>About the end of the year, Dr. Wicliff was &s;eized with a violent di&s;temper, which, it was feared, might have proved fatal. Upon this occa&s;ion, we are told, he was waited upon by a very extraordinary deputation. The begging friars, it &s;eems, whom he
<PB N="36" REF="52" MS="y">
had heretofore &s;o &s;everely treated, &s;ent four of their order, accompanied with four of the mo&s;t eminent citizens of Oxford, to attend him; who having gained admittance to his bed-chamber, acquainted him, that hearing he lay at the point of death, they were come in the name of their order, to put him in mind of the many injuries he had done them; and hoped for his &s;oul's &s;ake, that he would do them all the ju&s;tice now in his power, by retracting, in the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e re&s;pecta|ble per&s;ons, the many &s;evere and unju&s;t things he had &s;aid of them. Wicliff &s;urpri&s;|ed at this &s;olemn me&s;&s;age, rai&s;ed him&s;elf in his bed; and we are informed, with a &s;tern countenance cried out, <Q>I &s;hall not die, but live to declare the evil deeds of the friars.</Q> The unexpected force of his expre&s;&s;ion, together with the &s;ternne&s;s of his manner, the &s;tory adds, drove away the friars in confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Soon after his recovery, Dr. Wicliff &s;et about a great work, which he had often in|tended, the tran&s;lation of the &s;criptures into Engli&s;h. It had long given him great of|fence, and indeed he always con&s;idered it as one of the capital errors of popery, that the
<PB N="37" REF="53">
bible &s;hould be locked up from the peo|ple. He re&s;olved therefore to free it from this bondage. But before his great work ap|peared, he publi&s;hed a tract, in which, with great &s;trength of argument, he &s;hewed the nece&s;&s;ity of engaging in it. The bible, he affirmed, contained the whole of God's will. Chri&s;t's law, he &s;aid, was &s;ufficient to guide his church; and every chri&s;tian might there gather knowledge enough to make him ac|ceptable to God: and as to comments, he &s;aid, a good life was the be&s;t guide to the knowledge of &s;cripture; or, in his own lan|guage: <Q>He that keepeth righteou&s;ne&s;s hath the true under&s;tanding of holy writ.</Q></P>
<P>When he thought the&s;e arguments were &s;ufficiently dige&s;ted, his great work came a|broad, much to the &s;atisfaction of all &s;ober men.</P>
<P>Some have contended, that Dr. Wicliff was not the fir&s;t tran&s;lator of the bible into Engli&s;h. The truth &s;eems to be, that he was the fir&s;t, who tran&s;lated the whole together; of which, it is probable, others might have given detached parts. It does not however appear, that Dr. Wicliff un|der&s;tood the Hebrew language. His method was, to collect what Latin bibles he could find:
<PB N="38" REF="54">
from the&s;e he made one correct copy; and from this tran&s;lated. He afterwards examin|ed the be&s;t commentators then extant, parti|cularly Nicolas Lyra; and from them in&s;erted in his margin tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, in which the Latin differed from the Hebrew.</P>
<P>In his tran&s;lation of the bible, he &s;eems to have been literally exact. In his other works, his language was wonderfully elegant for the times in which he lived: but here he was &s;tudious only of the plain &s;en&s;e; which led him often, through the confu&s;ion of idioms, within the limits of non&s;en&s;e. <HI>Quid nobis &amp; tibi, Je&s;u fili dei,</HI> we find tran&s;lated thus, <HI>What to us, and to thee, Je&s;us the Son of God.</HI></P>
<P>This work, it may ea&s;ily be imagined, had no tendency to rein&s;tate him in the good opi|nion of the clergy. An univer&s;al clamour was immediately rai&s;ed. Knighton, a canon of Leice&s;ter, and a contemporary with Wicliff, hath left us, upon record, the language of the times. "Chri&s;t intru&s;ted his go&s;pel," &s;ays that eccle&s;ia&s;tic, <Q>to the clergy, and doctors of the church, to mini&s;ter it to the laity, and weaker &s;ort, according to their exigences, and &s;everal occa&s;ions. But this ma&s;ter John Wicliff, by tran&s;lating it, has made
<PB N="39" REF="55">
it vulgar; and has laid it more open to the laity, and even to women, who can read, than it u&s;ed to be to the mo&s;t learned of the clergy, and tho&s;e of the be&s;t under|&s;tanding: and thus the go&s;pel jewel, the evangelical pearl, is thrown about, and trodden under foot of &s;wine.</Q> Such lan|guage was looked upon as good rea&s;oning by the clergy of that day, who &s;aw not with what &s;atyr it was edged again&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hops, in the mean time, and mi|tred abbots, not content with railing, took more effectual pains to &s;top this growing evil. After much con&s;ultation, they brought a bill into parliament to &s;uppre&s;s Wicliff's bible. The advocates for it, &s;et forth in their u&s;ual manner, the alarming pro&s;pect of here|&s;y, which this ver&s;ion of the &s;criptures open|ed; and the ruin of all religion, which mu&s;t inevitably en&s;ue.</P>
<P>The&s;e zealots, were an&s;wered by the prin|cipal reformers, who judiciou&s;ly encountered them with their own weapons. It appears, &s;aid the Wiclivites, from the decretals, that more than &s;ixty different &s;pecies of here&s;y &s;prang up in the church, after the tran&s;lation of the bible into Latin. But the utility of that
<PB N="40" REF="56">
tran&s;lation, notwith&s;tanding its bad con&s;e|quences, all parties acknowledge. With what face therefore, they a&s;ked, could the bi&s;hops pretend to di&s;countenance an Eng|li&s;h tran&s;lation, when they could not produce one argument again&s;t it, which did not equally conclude again&s;t the Latin one? This rea|&s;oning &s;ilenced all oppo&s;ition; and the bill was thrown out by a great majority.</P>
<P>The zeal of the bi&s;hops to &s;uppre&s;s Wicliff's bible only made it, as is generally the ca&s;e, the more &s;ought after. They who were able, among the reformers, purcha&s;ed copies; and they who were not able, procured at lea&s;t tran&s;cripts of particular go&s;pels, or epi&s;tles, as their inclinations led. In after times, when lol|lardy increa&s;ed, and the flames were kindled, it was a common practice, to fa&s;ten about the neck of the condemned heretic, &s;uch of the&s;e &s;craps of &s;cripture as were found in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which generally &s;hared his fate.</P>
<P>Before the clamour, which was rai&s;ed a|gain&s;t Dr. Wicliff, on the account of his bi|ble, was in any degree &s;ilenced, he ventured a &s;tep farther; and attacked that favourite doctrine of the Roman church, the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="57">About the year 820 this &s;trange opinion was fir&s;t heard of. It owed its birth to Pa&s;|cha&s;e Radbert, a wild enthu&s;ia&s;t, who pub|li&s;hed it, not as fal&s;hood generally gains ground, by little and little; but at once glar|ing in its full ab&s;urdity. He informed the world, in plain language, that in the &s;acra|ment of the Lord's &s;upper, the elements af|ter con&s;ecration, are entirely changed into the body and blood of Chri&s;t; that very body, which was born of Mary, &s;uffered upon the cro&s;s, and ro&s;e from the dead. It is amazing, that an opinion &s;o big with ab&s;urdity, and yet unaided by prejudice, could fa&s;ten upon the minds of men, however rude of &s;cience. Yet the improbable tale, we find, went down, as if the greater the improbability, the more venerable the my&s;tery. It was found a doc|trine well adapted to impre&s;s the people with that awful and &s;uper&s;titious horror, which is the nece&s;&s;ary foundation of fal&s;e religion: as &s;uch therefore the church of Rome with great zeal upheld it; and if any were &s;tag|gered by the appearance of an impo&s;&s;ibility, they were pre&s;ently told, that, <Q>The acci|dents, or forms of bread and wine, it was true, &s;till remained after con&s;ecration; but
<PB N="42" REF="58">
by the omnipotence of God they remain|ed without a &s;ubject.</Q> This was the argu|ment of the clergy; and it was thought con|clu&s;ive, for who could doubt the omnipo|tence of God?</P>
<P>Dr. Wicliff, after a thorough examination of this doctrine, was entirely &s;atisfied, that it had no &s;criptural foundation. In his lec|tures therefore before the univer&s;ity of Ox|ford, in the year 1381, which he &s;eems &s;till to have continued every &s;ummer, as pro|fe&s;&s;or of divinity, he took upon him to con|fute this error; and to explain the real de&s;ign of the Lord's &s;upper. He principally en|deavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h, that the &s;ub&s;tance of the bread and wine in the Lord's &s;upper re|mained the &s;ame after con&s;ecration; and that the body and blood of Chri&s;t were not &s;ub|&s;tantially in them, but only figuratively. The&s;e conclu&s;ions he offered to defend pub|licly in the &s;chools. But the religious, who were now, it &s;eems, getting ground in the univer&s;ity, would not &s;uffer any que&s;tion of this kind to be moved: upon which Dr. Wicliff, without further ceremony, publi&s;h|ed a treati&s;e upon that &s;ubject; in which he went great lengths, and attacked the doctrine
<PB N="43" REF="59" MS="y">
of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation with all the freedom of a man, not he&s;itating, but fully convinced of the truth of what he maintained.</P>
<P>Dr. Barton was, at that time, vice-chan|cellor of Oxford. He was a per&s;on of great zeal again&s;t innovations in religion; which he con&s;idered as the &s;ymptoms of its ruin; and had always u&s;ed a bitterne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion in &s;peaking of Dr. Wicliff; which ea&s;ily &s;hewed with how much plea&s;ure he would take hold of any fair occa&s;ion again&s;t him. An occa&s;ion now offered. He called together therefore the heads of the univer&s;ity; and, finding he could influence a majority, ob|tained a decree, by which Wicliff's doctrine was condemned as heretical, and him&s;elf and his hearers threatened, if they per&s;i&s;ted in their errors, with impri&s;onment, and excommunication.</P>
<P>Dr. Wicliff, we are told, was greatly mor|tified on finding him&s;elf thus treated at Ox|ford, which had till now been his &s;anctuary. He had one re&s;ource however &s;till left, his generous patron the duke of Lanca&s;ter; to whom he re&s;olved to fly for protection, and through the hopes of who&s;e intere&s;t he ap|pealed
<PB N="44" REF="60" MS="y">
to the king from the vice-chancellor's &s;entence.</P>
<P>While Dr. Wicliff and his followers, who were now very numerous, were thus cen|&s;ured at Oxford, a calumny was rai&s;ed again&s;t them, which might have proved of more dangerous con&s;equence. It took its ri&s;e from an in&s;urrection, which at this time alarmed the whole kingdom.</P>
<P>Vexed by the &s;evere exaction of a &s;evere impo&s;t, the counties of Kent and Su&s;&s;ex took arms. Their body increa&s;ed as it moved; and under the conduct of one Tiler, ap|proached London with a force greatly &s;u|perior to any tumultuary troops that could be brought again&s;t it. Here the rebels, having done infinite mi&s;chief, and brought even the government to a treaty, were di&s;per&s;ed by the mere addre&s;s and re&s;olution of the young king. The behaviour of Richard, on this occa&s;ion, ought never to be omitted even in a &s;light account of the&s;e things, as it is the only part of his behaviour, through his whole life, that de&s;erves recording.</P>
<P>When all danger was over, and the thoughts of the mini&s;try were now turned
<PB N="45" REF="61">
upon puni&s;hing the guilty, great pains were taken by the enemies of Wicliff, to fix the odium of this in&s;urrection upon him; but with very little effect: for after the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny, nothing was produced to prove their accu&s;ation, but that one Ball, a prie&s;t, was &s;eized among the rebels, whom the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury had formerly thrown into pri&s;on for preaching Wicliff's doctrines. But it appeared, that Ball was a conceited, empty fellow, who through motives of va|nity was ready to adopt any &s;ingularity. And indeed the whole tenor of hi&s;tory has ex|culpated Wicliff, and his di&s;ciples on this head, by a&s;&s;igning other and more probable cau&s;es of this rebellion.</P>
<P>We left Dr. Wicliff, in the mid&s;t of his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, carrying up an appeal from the univer&s;ity to the king. But his appeal, it &s;eems, met with no countenance. The duke of Lanca&s;ter finding his credit declining, &s;uppo&s;ed probably that the protection he af|forded Wicliff might be the principal cau&s;e of its decline; perhaps too he might think this bold reformer, by attacking tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation, had gone greater lengths than could well be warranted; it is certain however,
<PB N="46" REF="62">
that he now for the fir&s;t time de&s;erted him; and when Dr. Wicliff pre&s;&s;ed his highne&s;s in the affair, and urged him with religious mo|tives, he was an&s;wered coolly, that of the&s;e things the church was the mo&s;t proper judge, and that the be&s;t advice he could give him was to quit the&s;e novelties, and &s;ubmit quietly to his ordinary. Wicliff finding him|&s;elf thus expo&s;ed, had only to wrap him&s;elf in his own integrity, and pu&s;h through the &s;torm as he was able.</P>
<P>It was a circum&s;tance greatly again&s;t him, that William Courtney was at this time pro|moted to the &s;ee of Canterbury; Simon of Sudbury, his predece&s;&s;or, having been mur|dered by the rebels in the late in&s;urrection. Courtney, when bi&s;hop of London, had been Wicliff's mo&s;t active adver&s;ary; and was now glad to find his hands &s;trengthened by the addition of &s;o much power, were it only for the ability it gave him to cru&s;h the Wiclivites. He highly approved therefore of what the vice-chancellor of Oxford had done, and re&s;olved to go vigorou&s;ly on with the pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>His piety however allowed Wicliff &s;ome re&s;pite. So &s;crupulous was the primate, even
<PB N="47" REF="63">
in matters of form, that he forbore any pub|lic exerci&s;e of his office, till he &s;hould receive the con&s;ecrated pall from Rome; which did not arrive till the May of the next year, 1382.</P>
<P>Being thus duly inve&s;ted, Dr. Wicliff was cited to appear before him in the mona&s;tery of the grey friers, on the 17th day of the &s;ame month: &s;o eager was the archbi&s;hop to enter upon this bu&s;ine&s;s!</P>
<P>But before we proceed in the relation, it may not be improper to inform the reader, that we find great ob&s;curity in the accounts of this part of Wicliff's life, many of the&s;e accounts differing from each other; and many being plainly contradictory. All there|fore, which in &s;uch a ca&s;e can be done, is to &s;elect, from a variety of circum&s;tances, &s;uch as &s;eem mo&s;t probable, and be&s;t founded.</P>
<P>Dr. Wicliff being thus cited before the archbi&s;hop, refu&s;ed to appear; alledging that as he was a member of the univer&s;ity, and held an office in it, he was exempt from epi&s;copal juri&s;diction. The univer&s;ity was now, it &s;eems, under different influence; the vice-chancellor was changed; and the determination of the majority was to &s;upport
<PB N="48" REF="64">
their member. With this plea therefore the archbi&s;hop remained &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>But though he could not proceed again&s;t the per&s;on of Wicliff, he re&s;olved however to proceed again&s;t his opinions. When the court therefore met on the appointed day, a large collection of articles, extracted from his books and &s;ermons, was produced.</P>
<P>In the in&s;tant, as the bi&s;hops and divines, of which this court con&s;i&s;ted, were about to enter upon bu&s;ine&s;s, a violent earthquake &s;hook the mona&s;tery. The affrighted bi&s;hops threw down their papers; cryed out, the bu|&s;ine&s;s was di&s;plea&s;ing to God; and came to a ha&s;ty re&s;olution to proceed no farther.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop alone remained unmoved. With equal &s;pirit and addre&s;s he chid their &s;uper&s;titious fears; and told them, that if the earthquake portended any thing, it portended the downfall of here&s;y; that as noxious va|pours are lodged in the bowels of the earth, and are expelled by the&s;e violent concu&s;&s;ions, &s;o by their &s;trenuous endeavours, the king|dom &s;hould be purified from the pe&s;tilential taint of here&s;y, which had infected it in every part.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="65">This &s;peech, together with the news, that the earthquake had been general through the city, as it was afterwards indeed found to have been through the i&s;land, di&s;pelled their fears. Dr. Wicliff would often merrily &s;peak of this accident; and would call this a&s;&s;em|bly, the council of the herydene; herydene being the old Engli&s;h word for earthquake.</P>
<P>The court, again compo&s;ed, entred warm|ly into the bu&s;ine&s;s; and went through the examination of all the articles. In fine, they came to a determination, that &s;ome of them were erroneous; and &s;ome plainly heretical.</P>
<P>This determination was publi&s;hed, and afterwards an&s;wered by Dr. Wicliff, who &s;hewed how much his enemies had mi&s;re|pre&s;ented him in &s;everal points; and defend|ed his opinions with a &s;pirit of truth and freedom, which brought over many to his party.</P>
<P>The primate took new offence at this au|dacity, as he called it, of Wicliff; and be|ing determined at all events to cru&s;h him, preferred a bill in parliament to enable &s;he|riffs (upon proper information from bi&s;hops) to proceed as far as impri&s;onment again&s;t the preachers of here&s;y. This bill pa&s;&s;ed the
<PB N="50" REF="66">
lords, but was rejected by the commons; who, being already jealous of the power of the clergy, were in no degree inclined to make any addition to it.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop, notwith&s;tanding this check, applied to the king for his licence, which he imagined would be full as effectu|al, though not &s;o plau&s;ible, as an act of par|liament. The king, immer&s;ed in plea&s;ures, thought only of tenths and &s;ub&s;idies, and could refu&s;e nothing to the clergy, who were &s;o ready on all occa&s;ions to comply with him. Letters patent therefore were immediately made out, granting the full powers, which the archbi&s;hop required.</P>
<P>The practice heretofore had been, in ca&s;es of this kind, for the king to grant &s;pecial li|cences on particular occa&s;ions. This unli|mited power therefore, before unheard of, was very di&s;agreeable to the whole nation. Accordingly, when the parliament met, which it did &s;oon after, heavy complaints came from every county to their repre&s;entatives, &s;etting forth, how much the people thought them|&s;elves aggrieved.</P>
<P>The alarm &s;pread through the hou&s;e, where the affair was taken up with a becom|ing
<PB N="51" REF="67">
zeal. <Q>The&s;e new powers, it was &s;aid, were dangerous encroachments.&mdash;If the liberties of the people were thus put into the hands of the clergy, the nation be|came &s;ubject to a new kind of de&s;poti&s;m. &mdash;Here&s;y was an unlimited word, and might bear as wide a con&s;truction as a bi&s;hop might chu&s;e to give it: nor could it be doubted, but it would often be made to &s;ignify whatever the pride, or avarice of the clergy might think expedient.</Q></P>
<P>This language was carried in a petition from the commons to the king. The king, as was u&s;ual, being in want of money, and afraid at this time of di&s;obliging the com|mons, revoked the licence through the hope of a &s;ub&s;idy from the laity, which he had ju&s;t before granted through the hope of an aid from the clergy.&mdash;Such were the weak politics of Richard; and thus was the arch|bi&s;hop's zeal baffled a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>In one point however the primate &s;ucceed|ed better. He obtained letters from the king, directed to the vice-chancellor and proctors of the univer&s;ity of Oxford, by which they were required to make diligent &s;earch in their colleges and halls for all who maintained he|retical
<PB N="52" REF="68">
opinions; particularly tho&s;e condemn|ed by the arch-bi&s;hop of Canterbury; and for all, who had in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the books of John Wicliff. Such delinquents were or|dered to be expelled the univer&s;ity; and the &s;heriff and mayor of Oxford were command|ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the academical magi&s;trates in the execution of this order. The arch-bi&s;hop al&s;o, him&s;elf wrote to the vice-chancellor, injoining him to publi&s;h in St. Mary's church the king's letter, and al&s;o tho&s;e articles of Wicliff's doctrine, which had been condemn|ed. The vice-chancellor mode&s;tly an&s;wered, that party at this time ran &s;o high in Oxford, where the &s;eculars, who generally favoured Dr. Wicliff, bore a principal &s;way, that &s;uch a publication would not only be very danger|ous to him&s;elf, but would greatly endanger al&s;o the peace of the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this, the violent primate call|ed him before the council, where he was vexed and que&s;tioned with all the inhuma|nity of in&s;olent authority. This brought him to a compliance; and every thing was pub|li&s;hed, and in what manner, the arch-bi&s;hop required.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="69">The vice-chancellor's fears however, were well grounded. The &s;ecular clergy were &s;o exceedingly incen&s;ed again&s;t the religious, that the univer&s;ity became a &s;cene of the ut|mo&s;t tumult: all &s;tudy was at an end: and to &s;uch an height were the animo&s;ities of the two parties carried, that they di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by badges, and were &s;carce con|trouled from breaking out into the mo&s;t vi|olent effects of rage.</P>
<P>Whether Dr. Wicliff was ever brought to any public que&s;tion in con&s;equence of the&s;e proceedings, we meet with no account. It is mo&s;t probable he was advi&s;ed by his friends to retire from the &s;torm. It is certain how|ever, that at this time he quitted the pro|fe&s;&s;or's chair, and took his final leave of the univer&s;ity of Oxford; which till now he &s;eems to have vi&s;ited generally once every year. &mdash;Thus the unwearied per&s;ecution of the archbi&s;hop prevailed; and that prelate had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing the man whom he hated, and whom, for &s;o many years he had in vain pur&s;ued, retreating at length before his power into an ob&s;cure part of the king|dom.&mdash;The &s;eeds however were &s;cattered, though the root was drawn. Wicliff's opi|nions
<PB N="54" REF="70">
began now to be propagated &s;o uni|ver&s;ally over the nation, that as a writer of tho&s;e times tells us, if you met two per&s;ons upon the road, you might be &s;ure that one of them was a lollard.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were doing in England, the di&s;&s;ention between the two popes conti|nued. Thus far they had fought with &s;pi|ritual weapons only, bulls, anathemas, and excommunications; and thus far their con|tention had excited only contempt. But Ur|ban perceiving how little the thunders of the church availed, had recour&s;e to more &s;ub|&s;tantial arms. With this view he publi&s;hed a bull, in which he called upon all, who had any regard for religion, to exert them&s;elves at this time in its cau&s;e; and take up arms again&s;t Clement, and his adherents, in defence of the holy &s;ee. The times, he &s;aid, required vio|lent mea&s;ures; and for the encouragement of the faithful he promi&s;ed the &s;ame pardons and indulgences, which had been always granted to tho&s;e, who lo&s;t their lives in the holy wars. This bull met with great en|couragement in England, e&s;pecially as the pope cho&s;e an eccle&s;ia&s;tic of that nation for his general, Henry Spencer, bi&s;hop of Nor|wich;
<PB N="55" REF="71">
<Q>a young and &s;tout prelate, &s;ays Fox, fitter for the camping cure, than for the peace|able church of Chri&s;t.</Q> This officer hav|ing obtained a parliamentary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and made his levies, &s;et out with great eagerne&s;s upon his expedition.</P>
<P>A war, in which the name of religion was &s;o vilely pro&s;tituted, rou&s;ed Dr. Wicliff's indignation, even in the decline of years. He took up his pen once more, and wrote again&s;t it with great acrimony. He expo&s;tu|lates with the pope in a very free manner, and a&s;ks him boldly, <Q>How he dur&s;t make the token of Chri&s;t on the cro&s;s (which is a token of peace, mercy, and charity) a banner to lead on to &s;lay chri&s;tian men, for the love of two fal&s;e prie&s;ts; and to oppre&s;s chri&s;tendom wor&s;e than Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles were oppre&s;&s;ed by the Jews. When, &s;ays he, will the proud prie&s;t of Rome grant indulgences to man|kind to live in peace and charity, as he now does to fight and &s;lay one another?</Q></P>
<P>This &s;evere piece drew upon him the re|&s;entment of Urban, and was likely to have involved him in greater troubles than he had yet experienced: but God him&s;elf delivered
<PB N="56" REF="72">
his faithful &s;ervant. He was &s;truck with a pal&s;y, &s;oon after the publication of this trea|ti&s;e; and though he lived &s;ome time, yet he lived in &s;uch a way, that his enemies con&s;i|dered him as a per&s;on below their re&s;entment. To the la&s;t he attended divine wor&s;hip; and received the fatal &s;troke of his di&s;order in his church at Lutterworth, in the year 1384.</P>
<P>The papi&s;ts of tho&s;e times gloried much in the circum&s;tances of his death. <Q>It was reported, one of them tells us, that he had prepared accu&s;ations, and bla&s;phemies, which he intended, on the day he was taken ill, to have uttered in his pulpit, a|gain&s;t Thomas a Becket, the &s;aint and martyr of the day; but by the judgment of God he was &s;uddenly &s;truck, and the pal&s;y &s;eized all his limbs; and that mouth which was to have &s;poken huge things again&s;t God, and his &s;aints, and holy church was mi&s;erably drawn a&s;ide, and afforded a frightful &s;pectacle to the beholders: His tongue was &s;peechle&s;s, and his head &s;hook, &s;hewing plainly that the cur&s;e of God was upon him.</Q></P>
<P>Thus did his enemies, in the true &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;tition, turn the mo&s;t common &s;ymp|toms
<PB N="57" REF="73">
of a common malady into divine judg|ments; and di&s;cover, by calling in &s;uch fee|ble aids, how much in earne&s;t their cau&s;e wanted a &s;upport.</P>
<P>Such was the life of John Wicliff; whom we he&s;itate not to admire as one of the great|e&s;t ornaments of his country; and as one of tho&s;e prodigies, whom providence rai&s;es up, and directs as its in&s;truments to enlighten mankind. His amazing penetration; his rational manner of thinking; and the noble freedom of his &s;pirit, are equally the objects of our admiration. Wicliff was in religion, what Bacon was afterwards in &s;cience; the great detecter of tho&s;e arts and glo&s;&s;es, which the barbari&s;m of ages had drawn together to ob&s;cure the mind of man.</P>
<P>To this intuitive genius Chri&s;tendom was unque&s;tionably more obliged than to any name in the li&s;t of reformers. He opened the gates of darkne&s;s, and let in not a fee|ble and glimmering ray; but &s;uch an efful|gence of light, as was never afterwards ob|&s;cured. He not only loo&s;ened prejudices; but advanced &s;uch clear inconte&s;tible truths, as, having once obtained footing, &s;till kept their ground, and even in an age of refor|mation
<PB N="58" REF="74">
wanted little amendment. How nearly his &s;entiments, almo&s;t on every topic, agreed with tho&s;e of the reformers of the &s;ucceeding century, hath been made the &s;ub|ject of &s;et enquiries, and will ea&s;ily appear from a general view of his opinions.</P>
<P>As the opinions of Wicliff make a very material part of his life, I have thought it proper to give a fuller account of them, in a &s;eparate view, than could well be intro|duced in the body of the work. The fol|lowing therefore, which are all either col|lected from his own words, or by a fair de|duction from them, are the principal opini|ons which this reformer held.</P>
<P>With regard to the church, he was not fond of applying the words <HI>church</HI> and <HI>church|men,</HI> merely to the clergy, as the&s;e were of|ten men of bad lives, he thought &s;uch ap|plication a vile pro&s;titution of tho&s;e &s;acred names. Be&s;ides, it had bad influence, he thought, upon the laity; &s;eeming to exclude them from the pale of Chri&s;t's church, and to give them a di&s;pen&s;ation for licentious practice. If they were not of Chri&s;t's church, they were not under Chri&s;t's laws. He would never therefore have any idea fixed to the
<PB N="59" REF="75">
word <HI>church,</HI> but that of the whole body of Chri&s;tians. In &s;ome of his writings he makes a di&s;tinction between the true church of Chri&s;t, and the nominal. By the true church he means &s;uch per&s;ons only as God &s;hall plea&s;e to &s;ave. Chri&s;t's nominal church he calls a net, yet undrawn to land, full of every kind, which mu&s;t afterwards be picked and &s;epa|rated.</P>
<P>He was a warm a&s;&s;ertor of the king's &s;u|premacy; to prove which he rea&s;oned thus. Under the old law, we read that Solomon depo&s;ed one high prie&s;t, and ordained ano|ther, by his own proper authority, without the concurrence of any eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ynod: and in the new te&s;tament, though we meet with no expre&s;s command on the point of the king's &s;upremacy; yet in general we are told, that magi&s;trates are ordained of God to puni&s;h evil doers, and that without any limitation. If then they are ordained to pu|ni&s;h evil doers, certainly they are, in the highe&s;t degree bound to puni&s;h tho&s;e, who do the mo&s;t evil: and who will contend, that the wicked prie&s;t is not a wor&s;e citizen, than the wicked layman? Chri&s;t, &s;ays he, and his apo&s;tles were obedient to the temporal
<PB N="60" REF="76">
powers then exi&s;ting: and not to mention the many precepts of the go&s;pel writers on this &s;ubject, which &s;eem to be generally di|rected to all Chri&s;tians; we &s;ee in one place our Saviour him&s;elf paying tribute to the emperor; and in another, an&s;wering before Pilate without claiming any exemption. &mdash; Again&s;t tho&s;e who maintained the pope's &s;u|premacy to be an article of faith he was very warm. The &s;aving faith of a chri&s;tian, &s;ays he, con&s;i&s;ts in believing, that Chri&s;t was the Me&s;&s;iah: but the Roman church has mul|tiplied articles of faith without number. It is not enough now to believe in Chri&s;t; we mu&s;t believe in the pope of Rome. The holy apo&s;tles never a&s;cribed to them&s;elves any &s;uch honour: how then can a &s;inful wretch require it, who knows not whether he &s;hall be damned or &s;aved? If the pope, &s;ays he, &s;hould happen to be a wicked man, we pro|fe&s;s it as an article of our belief, that a devil of hell is head of the church &mdash; that he is the mo&s;t holy father, infallible, and without &s;in, who poi&s;ons the principles of the church, and corrupts its practice, who contributes what he is able to bani&s;h out of it faith,
<PB N="61" REF="77">
meekne&s;s, patience, charity, humility, and every other virtue of a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>The authority likewi&s;e claimed by the church Dr. Wicliff &s;trenuo&s;ly oppo&s;ed. It was a &s;candal, he would &s;ay, to the chri&s;tian church, that any of its members &s;hould &s;et up their own authority again&s;t that of their Saviour. The great argument of that day (which was indeed a &s;ubtle one) for the au|thority of the church, was this. Many per|&s;ons, be&s;ides Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, wrote go&s;pels; but the church reject|ed them all, excepting the&s;e four: and this it did by its own proper authority. It might by the &s;ame authority have rejected tho&s;e four go&s;pels, and have received others. It fol|lows therefore, that the authority of the church is above that of any go&s;pel.&mdash;To this Dr. Wicliff replied, that the evidence for the received go&s;pels was &s;o &s;trong, and that for the rejected ones &s;o weak, that the church could not have done otherwi&s;e than it did, without doing violence to rea&s;on. But the be&s;t argument, he &s;aid, if it were proper to avow it, for &s;upporting the autho|rity of the church, was the nece&s;&s;ity of that doctrine to &s;upport the tyranny of the pope.

This was what made it worth defending at the expence of truth.&mdash;In another place, &s;peaking on the &s;ame &s;ubject, he &s;ays, that the pope would not &s;ubmit his actions to the &s;ame criterion, by which Chri&s;t was content|ed to have his actions tried. if I do not, &s;ays Chri&s;t, the works of my father which is in heaven, believe me not. But the pope's authority, it &s;eems, mu&s;t be acknowledged, though he manife&s;tly does the works of the devil. Thus, &s;ays he, Chri&s;tians are in greater thraldom than the Jews under the old law; and that liberty, by which Chri&s;t hath made us free, is by the wickedne&s;s of de&s;igning men, changed into the mo&s;t ab|&s;olute &s;piritual bondage. The days, &s;ays he, I hope, will come, when men &s;hall be wi&s;e enough to &s;hake from their necks the do|minion of the&s;e human ordinances; and di&s;dain &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to any eccle&s;ia&s;tical in|junctions, but &s;uch as are plainly authorized by the word of God.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn Dr. Wicliff's opinions about the church, I &s;hall now give the reader &s;ome of his opinions upon church doctrines.</P>
<P>He acknowledged &s;even &s;acraments; but is very inaccurate in his definition of a &s;acra|ment;
<PB N="63" REF="79">
which he calls, <HI>A token that may be &s;een of a thing that may not be &s;een.</HI> This inaccuracy however, is not peculiar to Wic|liff. We meet with it univer&s;ally among&s;t the old writers in divinity, both before and after his time; who&s;e idea of a &s;acrament &s;eems to have been extremely vague: from Wicliff's logical exactne&s;s we might have expected a more accurate definition.</P>
<P>But though he thus acknowledges &s;even &s;acraments, he expre&s;ly &s;ays, he does not e&s;teem them all nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation; and inveighs warmly again&s;t the many idle cere|monies u&s;ed by the church of Rome in the admini&s;tration of them all; ceremonies, he &s;ays, which have no u&s;e in them&s;elves, nor any foundation in &s;cripture. When ceremonies are few and expre&s;&s;ive, he thinks, they may be of u&s;e; and enumerates, among others, kneeling, and beating the brea&s;t in prayer.</P>
<P>With regard to bapti&s;m, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation. This he grounded on the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Except a man be born of wa|ter and of the &s;pirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God;</HI> which he under&s;tood of material water. But he oppo&s;ed the &s;uper|&s;tition
<PB N="64" REF="80">
of three immer&s;ions. In ca&s;e of nece&s;|&s;ity, he thought, any one pre&s;ent might bap|tize. The prie&s;t, he &s;aid, in bapti&s;m (as indeed in all the other &s;acraments) admi|ni&s;tered only the token or &s;ign; but God, who is the prie&s;t, and bi&s;hop of our &s;ouls, admini&s;ters the &s;piritual grace. This gave occa&s;ion to his enemies to repre&s;ent him (which they did with great fal&s;hood) as denying any u&s;e of material water. When he &s;peaks of water, &s;ay they, he means only figuratively the water, which flowed from the &s;ide of Chri&s;t.&mdash;With regard to the que&s;tion, whether unbaptized infants could be &s;aved, he waves it, adding, that he thinks it probable, Chri&s;t may &s;piritually baptize &s;uch infants, and con&s;equently &s;ave them. This opinion too might afford &s;ome founda|tion to the &s;lander above-mentioned; though he guards again&s;t it by &s;aying, that we mu&s;t not neglect bapti&s;m by water, on a &s;uppo&s;i|tion, that we are baptized by the &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Of the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper, we have <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 42.</NOTE> already &s;een his opinion. But though it appears from the account given
<PB N="65" REF="81">
of his creed in this point, that he thought bread and wine only &s;igns of Chri&s;t's body; yet in other parts of his writings we find him &s;peaking of them in a much higher &s;train. The truth &s;eems to be, that he was late in &s;ettling his notions of the Lord's &s;upper: whence it is, that in different parts of his writings he contradicts him&s;elf. This appears to be the foundation of Melancthon's complaint. <Q>I have looked, &s;ays he, into Wicliff; and find him very confu&s;ed in this controver&s;y of the Lord's &s;upper.</Q></P>
<P>With regard to confirmation, he thought the oil, and the veil made u&s;e of by the bi&s;hop, had no foundation in &s;cripture, and were better omitted; and that the other ceremonies, together with all the parade and pomp, which accompany this &s;acrament were &s;till wor&s;e, tending only to fix the minds of the people upon trifles, and to impre&s;s on them a &s;uper&s;titious veneration for the clergy. He could &s;ee no rea&s;on, why the prie&s;t might not confirm, as well as baptize; bapti&s;m, he &s;aid, mu&s;t be ac|knowledged to be the &s;acrament of greater dignity, ina&s;much as it is of more authentic go&s;pel-in&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="82">Speaking of matrimony, he inveighs warmly again&s;t granting divorces on &s;light occa&s;ions, as was cu&s;tomary in the church of Rome; and &s;ays, that a divorce can be ju&s;tified on no cau&s;e, but that of adultery.</P>
<P>In extreme unction he &s;ees nothing un|&s;criptural: at lea&s;t I meet with nothing of objection to it, in any part of his writings which I have &s;een. Only indeed, he blames the exorbitant fees, which the avarice of the prie&s;ts of tho&s;e times exacted for the performance of it.</P>
<P>Speaking likewi&s;e of orders, he inveighs again&s;t the &s;ame avarice; and jocularly &s;ays, a man might have a barber to attend him a whole year for what he pays to have his crown &s;haven once.</P>
<P>With regard to confe&s;&s;ion, his opinion was, that if a man be really contrite, exter|nal confe&s;&s;ion is by no means of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity; yet as it may be a means to bring on repentance, he would not reject it, if a proper choice be made of a confe&s;&s;or. But as confe&s;&s;ion was practi&s;ed in the church of Rome, he thought it a vile and &s;candalous method of getting into the &s;ecrets of fami|lies,
<PB N="67" REF="83">
and tended only to advance the power of the church.</P>
<P>Pennance, he &s;ays, hath no &s;ort of merit in God's &s;ight, unle&s;s followed by a reformed life.</P>
<P>Of ab&s;olution, as practi&s;ed in the church of Rome, he was a warm oppo&s;er. It was the height of bla&s;phemy, he &s;aid, to a&s;cribe to man the power of God. <HI>Who can forgive &s;ins, but God alone?</HI> In&s;tead of acting as God's mini&s;ters, the Romi&s;h clergy, he &s;aid, took upon them, in their own names, to forgive &s;ins. Nay in the plenitude of their power they will do, &s;ays he, what God him&s;elf (if there is truth in &s;cripture) would not do&mdash;pardon unrepented &s;in. Expre&s;s pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture in favour of the contrite heart are nothing: God's ab&s;olution is of no effect, unle&s;s confirmed by theirs. Pre|&s;umptuous guides, &s;ays he, they ought to urge the nece&s;&s;ity of repentance, in&s;tead of ab&s;olution; and preach a future &s;tate of re|wards and puni&s;hments, the deformity of &s;in, and the mercy of God, in&s;tead of de|ceiving mankind by their ridiculous im|po&s;tures.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="84">Again&s;t indulgences, he was very &s;evere. A mere trick, he called them, to rob men of their money. The pope, &s;ays he, has the &s;urplus of the merits of pious &s;aints to di&s;po&s;e of. A profitable doctrine this; but where found? Certainly not in &s;cripture. For my own part, &s;ays he, I meet not, in the whole new-te&s;tament with one &s;aint who had more merit than was nece&s;&s;ary for his own &s;alvation. And if Chri&s;t, who taught all that was needful and profitable, taught not this doctrine, it may be fairly pre&s;umed, that this doctrine is neither needful nor pro|fitable. All men, as far as the merits of another can avail, are partakers of the merits of Chri&s;t: and no man can expect more. How ab&s;urd then is it to &s;ee men &s;quander away their money upon indulgences, in&s;tead of laying it out properly in charitable u&s;es: as if it were a more acceptable &s;ervice to God, to add &s;uperfluous wealth to a mo|na&s;tery, than to di&s;tribute alms among ne|ce&s;&s;itous chri&s;tians.&mdash;Be&s;ides, in how un|charitable a light doth the pope appear, if there be one &s;oul left in purgatory. A turn of his pen would deliver the &s;inner, and if he deny that, it can only be thought ava|rice,
<PB N="69" REF="85">
and want of a good heart.&mdash;If he have not power to deliver all men, he is a de|ceiver; for he declares, that he has &s;uch power. But his pardons, it &s;eems, are only to be had for ready money, and granted too, not for the good of mankind, but to pro|mote di&s;&s;ention and war. Were this boa&s;ted power of pardoning an heavenly gift, like God's other favours, it would certainly be di&s;pen&s;ed in an impartial manner. Wealth could not command it: and the pope, like the apo&s;tles, would cry out, <Q>Thy money peri&s;h with thee.</Q> Whether the pope's pardons be di&s;pen&s;ed in this impartial man|ner, let the papi&s;t &s;ay. They will tell you perhaps, he adds, that the pardons them|&s;elves are a free gift; but that the bull oc|ca&s;ions the expence. Such prevarication puts one in mind of the ho&s;t, who profe&s;&s;ed to treat his gue&s;ts with a goo&s;e for nothing; but charged them without con&s;cience for the &s;auce.&mdash;Thus by the vile trade of indul|gences are men deceived. Any one, who can pay for a pardon, may laugh at &s;in. He has found an ea&s;y way to heaven; much ea&s;ier than by contrition, repentance, and works of charity. May we not then, &s;ays
<PB N="70" REF="86">
he, &s;afely conclude, that indulgences were an invention of anti-chri&s;t to magnify the &s;acerdotal power; and to bring in wealth to the church, at the expence of religion, and the &s;ouls of men?</P>
<P>With regard to purgatory, he believed in &s;uch a &s;tate; and, as it appears from &s;ome parts of his works, was once of opinion that pious prayers might be &s;erviceable to &s;ouls impri&s;oned there: but in his later writings, he wholly renounces this opinion, and calls it a pernicious error; e&s;pecially to pray for one per&s;on more than another, which he looks upon as a mo&s;t unchri&s;tian practice; though he &s;till &s;eems to think we may pray in general for all tho&s;e, whom God in his mercy intends for happine&s;s. In &s;hort, upon this &s;ubject he does not &s;eem to have ab&s;o|lutely fixed his opinion. He &s;aw &s;omething extremely plau&s;ible in the Romi&s;h doctrine of purgatory; he likewi&s;e &s;aw the ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing, that God intru&s;ted any man with a power to relea&s;e &s;inners from &s;uch a &s;tate; but whether the &s;ouls of the dead might be profited by the prayers of the living, he &s;eems to have been in doubt.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="87">He was a great enemy to the endowments of chauntry-prie&s;ts. They led the people, he thought, to put their tru&s;t in &s;uch en|dowments, rather than in a good life: whereas no prayers, even of the holie&s;t &s;aints, he thought, could benefit a bad man. <HI>That man,</HI> &s;aith he excellently, <HI>who liveth be&s;t, prayeth be&s;t.</HI> A &s;imple pater-no&s;ter from a religious plowman, is of more value in the &s;ight of God, than a thou&s;and ma&s;&s;es from a wicked prelate.</P>
<P>He had a great di&s;like to chaunting in di|vine wor&s;hip, which was then commonly u&s;ed in cathedrals and religious hou&s;es; and was known by the name of the new &s;ong. This &s;ort of wor&s;hip, he &s;ays, was originally introduced to impo&s;e on the under&s;tanding, by &s;ub&s;tituting &s;ound in the room of &s;en&s;e; and &s;o to be one mean of keeping the peo|ple in ignorance. He owns it is a merry way of &s;erving God; and therefore, he &s;uppo&s;es, it meets with &s;o much encourage|ment. But he would have men be of St. Au&s;tin's opinion, who &s;ays, that as often as &s;ound drew his attention from &s;en&s;e, &s;o often he wor&s;hipped God improperly. If, &s;ays he, the temple-mu&s;ic of the old law be
<PB N="72" REF="88">
alledged as a &s;ufficient warrant for cathe|dral wor&s;hip, it may ea&s;ily be an&s;wered, that Chri&s;t, who was the be&s;t commentator upon the old law, gives us no in&s;truction on this head; but tells his di&s;ciples, that he requires no recommendation of prayer, but the devotion of the heart. Others again will perhaps &s;ay, that the angels prai&s;e God, in heaven: to which, it may as ea&s;ily be an&s;wered, that we know nothing of hea|venly mu&s;ick. Only this we know, that the angels are in a triumphant &s;tate, and we in a militant one; in a &s;tate of trial and af|fliction, where mu&s;ick diverts us from better things. It is grievous, &s;ays he, to &s;ee what &s;ums of money are yearly expended upon the&s;e &s;inging prie&s;ts, and how little upon the education of children. Be&s;ides, he adds, how ab&s;urd is it to hear, in a large congre|gation, only two or three chaunting a piece of devotion, while all the re&s;t, not only cannot join with them; but even do not under&s;tand what they &s;ay.</P>
<P>He often inveighs again&s;t prayers to &s;aints, and the u&s;e of any mediator except Chri&s;t. He even goes &s;o far as to wi&s;h that all fe&s;ti|vals in the church were aboli&s;hed, except
<PB N="73" REF="89">
Chri&s;tmas-day, and ea&s;ter. For the devo|tion of the people, &s;ays he, being undivided, would be more fervent upon tho&s;e &s;olemn days. As to modern canonizations, he &s;ays, they owe their birth to nothing but exce&s;&s;ive bigotry on one &s;ide, or exce&s;&s;ive avarice on the other.</P>
<P>With regard to images, he thought, that if they were exact repre&s;entations of the truth, they might be very &s;erviceable to give the vulgar &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions of the poverty, and &s;ufferings, of Chri&s;t, his apo&s;tles, and martyrs. But this u&s;e, he &s;ays, could not be expected from them in the Roman church. Tho&s;e gay repre&s;entations, decked in co&s;tly apparel, in&s;tead of giving us the idea of &s;uf|fering &s;aints, exhibit to us per&s;ons of pomp and expence; and &s;hould be con&s;idered as heretical books, full of fal&s;e doctrines; and as &s;uch &s;hould be condemned to the fire. &mdash; Be&s;ides, &s;ays he, how &s;hocking is it to &s;ee tho&s;e dumb idols covered with gold and &s;il|ver; while Chri&s;t's poor members are &s;tarving in the &s;treets. &mdash; But of all the bad effects which attend images, the wor&s;t, he &s;ays, is their leading the people into idolatry. If Hezechiah broke in pieces the brazen &s;er|pent,
<PB N="74" REF="90">
which God commanded to be made, becau&s;e it attracted the veneration of the people; how much more ought a chri&s;tian king to break in pieces tho&s;e images, which God is &s;o far from having commanded to be made, that we have in &s;cripture the mo&s;t expre&s;s commands again&s;t making them.</P>
<P>He greatly di&s;liked the ceremonies of con&s;ecration &s;o frequent in the church of Rome. The&s;e con&s;ecrations, &s;ays he, and benedictions, in which the Roman church is &s;o profu&s;e upon water, oil, &s;alt, wax, ve&s;tments, walls, pilgrims-&s;taves, and a va|riety of other things, have more the appear|ance of necromancy, than of true religion. They are ab&s;urd, becau&s;e the&s;e things are ju&s;t the &s;ame after con&s;ecration as before: and they are idolatrous, becau&s;e they tend to make people pay a divine honour to them.</P>
<P>No man could be more &s;trenuous than Dr. Wicliff again&s;t re&s;ting upon the externals of religion; or &s;aid more to convince men of the folly of expecting, that building and ornamenting churches, frequenting public wor&s;hip, or any outward expre&s;&s;ion of reli|gion, would &s;atisfy God without the heart, or make any atonement for a bad life. Holy
<PB N="75" REF="91">
water, &s;ays he, and the ble&s;&s;ing of a bi&s;hop are mere impo&s;itions, tending only to blind the people, and make them re&s;t in tho&s;e ex|ternals, rather than in God's mercy, and their own repentance.</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;erted the nece&s;&s;ity of being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by divine grace. Without this, he &s;aw not how a human being could make him&s;elf acceptable to God.</P>
<P>With regard to pilgrimages, he &s;ays, that although vi&s;iting the &s;hrines of &s;aints might be &s;uffered with a view to impre&s;s us &s;trongly with a &s;en&s;e of their virtues, yet pilgrimages, as commonly u&s;ed, are of mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equence. If idol-wor&s;hip be bad, pil|grimages are equally &s;o, leading the people into idolatry, and a mi&s;application of their charity.</P>
<P>Again&s;t &s;anctuaries he is &s;till warmer. That the gro&s;&s;e&s;t crimes &s;hould be &s;heltered, under the &s;afeguard of religion, was, in his opinion, &s;uch a perver&s;ion of all the princi|ples of rea&s;on and Chri&s;tianity, as could not be &s;ufficiently exclaimed again&s;t.</P>
<P>He was a great advocate for the marriage of the clergy, and thought the celibacy pre|&s;cribed
<PB N="76" REF="92">
by the Roman church one of the principal cau&s;es of its corruption.</P>
<P>He denied the power of excommunica|tion to the church; and &s;tiles &s;uch eccle&s;i|a&s;tical cen&s;ures, puni&s;hments inflicted by anti-chri&s;t's juri&s;diction. No man, &s;ays he, can be excommunicated, unle&s;s he fir&s;t ex|communicate him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Peter-pence, he calls an iniquitous im|po&s;ition, without any foundation in &s;cripture.</P>
<P>The&s;e are his principal opinions, with regard to church doctrines. The following are his opinions on &s;everal mi&s;cellaneous &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>He was a great enemy to the &s;uperfluous wealth of the clergy. He allowed the la|bourer to live by his labour; but he a&s;&s;erted, that he had a right to his hire from nothing el&s;e. Tythes, he &s;aid, were only a &s;ort of alms, no where of go&s;pel in&s;titution, which the people might either give or withdraw, as they found their pa&s;tor de&s;erved. This opinion drew upon him the re&s;entment both of papi&s;ts and prote&s;tants. Melancthon, in particular, is very warm with him on this head; &s;ays, he raved, and declares him plainly mad. But it is no wonder, if Wic|liff's
<PB N="77" REF="93">
di&s;like to the prevailing luxury of the clergy, which was then &s;o exorbitant, led him into an extreme. His con&s;tant advice to his brethren was, to exact their tythes by the holine&s;s of their lives. If thou be a prie&s;t, &s;ays he, contend with others, not in pomp, but in piety. Ill befits it a man, who lives on the labours of the poor, to &s;quan|der away the dear-bought fruits of their in|du&s;try upon his own extravagancies.</P>
<P>Church-endowments, he thought, were the root of all the corruption among the clergy. He often lamented the luxury they occa&s;ioned; and u&s;ed to wi&s;h the church was again reduced to its primitive poverty, and innocence.</P>
<P>With &s;till greater warmth he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf again&s;t the &s;ecular employments of the clergy. This he &s;eemed to think an unpardonable de&s;ertion of their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In &s;ome parts of his writings, he appears to have held, that &s;trange doctrine, <HI>That dominion is founded on grace.</HI> His argu|ment, if I under&s;tand it all, &s;eems to be, that as all things belong to God, and as good men alone are the children of God, they are of cour&s;e the only true inheritors.
<PB N="78" REF="94">
But in other parts of his writings, it appears, as if he only &s;poke figuratively on this &s;ub|ject, and of ideal perfection. That he did not hold the doctrine in its literal &s;en&s;e, &s;eems plain from many pa&s;&s;ages of his works. In his Trialogue particularly, he &s;ays, <Q>Duplici titulo &s;tat hominem habere temporalia, &s;cilicet titulo originalis ju&s;ti|tiae, &amp; titulo mundanae ju&s;titiae. Titulo autem originalis ju&s;titiae habuit Chri&s;tus omnia bona mundi. Illo titulo, vel titulo gratiae, ju&s;torum &s;unt omnia: &s;ed longe ab illo titulo civilis po&s;&s;e&s;&s;io.</Q> Upon the whole, however, what he &s;ays on this &s;ub|ject may be called whim&s;ical.</P>
<P>He held fa&s;ting to be enjoined only for the &s;ake of virtuous habits; and calls it therefore highly phari&s;aical to place a greater value upon bodily ab&s;tinence from food, than &s;pi|ritual ab&s;tinence from &s;in.</P>
<P>It was a conjecture of his, that this world was created to &s;upply the lo&s;s in heaven occa&s;ioned by the fallen angels; and that when that lo&s;s &s;hould be &s;upplied, the end of things &s;hould &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>Upon a text in the revelations he founded an opinion, that the devil was let loo&s;e about
<PB N="79" REF="95">
a thou&s;and years after Chri&s;t; from which period he dates the ri&s;e of the principal corruptions of the church.</P>
<P>With regard to oaths, he con&s;idered it as plain idolatry to &s;wear by any creature. In this &s;en&s;e he under&s;tood the prohibition of our Saviour again&s;t &s;wearing by heaven and earth. It is not found, &s;aith he, in the old law, that God at any time granted his per|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;wear by any creature.</P>
<P>He &s;eems to have thought it wrong, upon the principles of the go&s;pel, to take away the life of man upon any occa&s;ion. The whole trade of war he thought utterly unlawful: nor did he think the execution of a criminal a more allowed practice.</P>
<P>In &s;ome parts of his writings he &s;peaks &s;o &s;trongly of fate, that he appears an ab&s;olute prede&s;tinarian. In other parts he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in &s;o cautious a manner, that we are apt to think he had no fixed principles on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>All arts, which admini&s;tred to the luxuries of life, he thought were prohibited by the go&s;pel. The &s;criptures, &s;ays he, tell us, that having food and raiment, we &s;hould be therewith content.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="96">Here&s;y, according to Wicliff, con&s;i&s;ted in a bad life, as well as in fal&s;e opinions. No good man, he thought, could be an heretic.</P>
<P>His opinion, on this la&s;t point, agrees with that of a prelate of later times, who gene|rally &s;peaks the language of true Chri&s;tian freedom and charity. I &s;hall quote &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages at large from this celebrated writer not only as they tend to &s;hew the ju&s;tne&s;s of Wicliff's own manner of thinking; but as they may &s;erve as a conclu&s;ion to this review of his opinions, in being a proper an&s;wer to all his adver&s;aries.</P>
<P><Q>No here&s;ies, (&s;ays bi&s;hop Taylor, in his liberty of prophe&s;ying) are noted in &s;crip|ture; but &s;uch as are errors practical. In all the animadver&s;ions again&s;t errors in the new te&s;tament, no pious per&s;on was con|demned. Something was ami&s;s in genere morum. Here&s;y is not an error of the under&s;tanding, but an error of the will. And indeed, if we remember that St. Paul reckons here&s;y among the works of the fle&s;h, and ranks it with all manner of practical impieties, we &s;hall ea&s;ily perceive, that if a man mingles not a vice with his opinions, if he be innocent in his life,
<PB N="81" REF="97">
though deceived in his doctrine, his error is his mi&s;ery, not his crime: he may be an object of pity, but by no means a per&s;on con&s;igned to ruin.&mdash;There are as many innocent cau&s;es of error, as there are weakne&s;&s;es, and unavoidable prejudices. &mdash; In que&s;tions practical, the doctrine it&s;elf, and the per&s;on too, may be reproved; but in other things, which end in notion, where neither the doctrine is malicious, nor the per&s;on apparently criminal, he is to be left to the judgment of God.

is to be charged as criminal upon a pious per&s;on, &s;ince no &s;imple error is &s;in, nor does condemn us before the throne of God.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A very ingenious hi&s;torian, hath charged Wicliff with enthu&s;ia&s;m. <Q>He denyed the doctrine, (&s;ays he,) of the real pre&s;ence &mdash; the &s;upremacy of the church of Rome &mdash; the merit of mona&s;tic vows. &mdash; He maintained; that the &s;cripture was the &s;ole rule of faith; &mdash; that the church was dependent on the &s;tate, &mdash; and ought to be reformed by it; &mdash; that the clergy ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s no e&s;tates; &mdash; that the begging fryars were a general nui&s;ance, and ought not to be &s;upported; &mdash; that the numerous ceremo|nies of the church were hurtful to true piety. &mdash; He a&s;&s;erted, that oaths were unlawful, &mdash; that dominion was founded in grace; &mdash; that every thing was &s;ubject to fate and de&s;tiny; and that all men were prede&s;tinated either to eternal &s;alvation or reprobation.</Q></P>
<P>Having given this ab&s;tract of his opinions, which is in general very ju&s;t, the hi&s;torian informs us, that <Q>From the <HI>whole</HI> of his doctrines, Wicliff appears to have been <HI>&s;trongly</HI> tinctured with enthu&s;ia&s;m.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Hume has certainly expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf here in a very unguarded manner, unle&s;s he meant to brand under the name of enthu&s;iam, the whole &s;y&s;tem of the reformation. He has given us twelve of the opinions of Wicliff, of which only the &s;eventh, and two la&s;t, &s;eem to be carried farther, than was done by the more &s;ober part of the reformers of the &s;ixteenth century; and indeed, Mr. Hume has been ingenuous enough to own, that, <Q>The doctrines of Wicliff, being derived from his &s;earch into the &s;criptures, and into eccle&s;ia&s;tical antiquity, were nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e propagated by the reformers in the &s;ixteenth cen|tury; &s;ome of them only carried farther.</Q> And yet, notwith&s;tanding this, we are told, that, <Q>Upon the <HI>whole,</HI> they were <HI>&s;trongly</HI> tinctured with enthu&s;ia&s;m.</Q></P>
<P>This writer has been charged with re&s;olving all revealed religion into enthu&s;ia&s;m on one hand, or &s;uper&s;tition on the other. And indeed his treatment of Wicliff &s;eems in &s;ome degree to ju&s;tify the charge: <Q>He appears, (&s;ays the hi&s;to|rian,) to have been &s;trongly tinctured with enthu&s;ia&s;m, and to have been thereby the better qualified to oppo&s;e a church, who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing character was &s;uper&s;tition.</Q> It was his enthu&s;ia&s;m, it &s;eems, and not his rational argu|ments, (for our hi&s;torian appears to have thrown rea&s;on out of both &s;ides of the que&s;tion) that made him a formidable adver&s;ary to the church of Rome.</P>
<P>If Mr. Hume had not been under the influence of pre|judice, it is impo&s;&s;ible but a per&s;on of his liberal ca&s;t of mind, mu&s;t have admired the noble freedom, and rational manner, with which this great reformer oppo&s;ed the &s;lavi&s;h principles of his times. Had Wicliff lived in the days of philo&s;ophy, this writer had been among his fir&s;t admirers; but a religioni&s;t is a formal character; and what in a phi|lo&s;opher is a manly exerci&s;e of rea&s;on, becomes in a modern reformer, irrational zeal, and a ridiculous pretence to in&s;piration.</P>
<P>If I have mi&s;taken Mr. Hume's meaning, I heartily beg his pardon. The reader, judging for him&s;elf, will lay no farther &s;tre&s;s on what I have &s;aid, than fair quotations will authorize again&s;t Mr. Hume; and fair repre&s;entations of facts in favour of Dr. Wicliff.</P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>Why many prie&s;ts have no benefices. <HI>A treati&s;e of John Wicliff.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Some cau&s;es why poor prie&s;ts receive not benefices. The fir&s;t for dread of Symony. The &s;econd for dread of mi&s;pending poor mens goods. The third for dread of letting of better occupation that is more light or ea&s;y, more certain and more profitable.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="89" REF="105">I. For fir&s;t, if men &s;hould come to bene|fices by gift of prelates, there is dread of &s;ymony. For commonly they taken the fir&s;t fruits, or other pen&s;ions, or holden curates in office in their courts or chapels, in offices far fro prie&s;ts life, taught, and en&s;ampled of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. So that commonly &s;uch benefices comen not freely as Chri&s;t commandeth, but rather for worldly win|ning, or flattering of mighty men, and not for kunning of God's law, and true preach|ing of the go&s;pel, and en&s;ample of holy life; and therefore commonly the&s;e prelates, and receivers ben fouled with &s;ymony, that is cur&s;ed here&s;ie, as God's law and man's law techen. And now whoever can run to Rome, and bear gold out of the lond, and &s;trive, and plead, and cur&s;e for tithes, and other temporal profits, that ben cleped with anti|chri&s;t's clerks rights of holy church, &s;hall have great benefices of cure of many thou|&s;and &s;ouls, tho he be unable, and of cur&s;ed life, and wicked en&s;ample of pride, of co|veti&s;&s;e, glotony, leachery, and other great &s;ins. But if there be any &s;imple man, that de&s;ireth to live well, and teche truly God's law, he &s;hall ben holden an hypocrite, a new
<PB N="90" REF="106">
teacher, an heretick, and not &s;uffered to come to any benefice. But if in any little poor place he liven a poor life, he &s;hall be &s;o pur&s;ued, and &s;landered, that he &s;hall be put out by wiles, cantels, frauds, and world|ly violence, and impri&s;oned or brent. And if lords &s;hullen pre&s;ent clerks to benefices, they wolen have commonly gold in great quantity, and holden the&s;e curates in &s;ome worldly office, and &s;uffren the wolves of hell to &s;tranglen mens &s;ouls, &s;o that they have their office done for nought, and their chap|pels holden up for vain-glory or hypocri&s;y; and yet they wolen not pre&s;ent a clerk able of God's law, and of good life, and holy en&s;ample to the people; but a kitchen-clerk, or a penny-clerk, or one wi&s;e in building ca&s;tles, or other worldly doing; tho he kun not read his &s;auter, and knoweth not the commandments of God, ne &s;acraments of holy church. And yet &s;ome lords, to co|louren their &s;ymony wole not take for them|&s;elves, but kerchiefs for the lady, or a pal|fray, or a tun of wine. And when &s;ome lords woulden pre&s;ent a good man, then &s;ome ladies ben means to have a dancer pre|&s;ented, or a tripper on tapits, or hunter, or
<PB N="91" REF="107">
a hawker, or a wild player of &s;ummer gam|bels. And thus it &s;eemeth, that both pre|lates, and lords commonly maken &s;ome cur|&s;ed antichri&s;t, or a quick fiend to be ma&s;ter of Chri&s;t's people, for to leaden them to hell to Sathanas their ma&s;ter; and &s;uffer not Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples to teche Chri&s;t's go&s;pel to his children for to &s;ave their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>But in this pre&s;enting of evil curates, and holding of curates in worldly office, letting them fro their gho&s;tly cure, ben three de|grees of traitery agen&s;t God and his people. The fir&s;t is in prelates and lords, that thus holden curates in their worldly office; for they have their high &s;tates in the church, and lord&s;hips, for to purvey true curates to the people, and to meyntene them in God's law, and puni&s;h them, if they failen in their gho&s;tly cure, and by this they holden their lord&s;hips of God. Then if they maken evil curates, and holden them in their worldly office, and letten them to lead God's people the rightful way to heaven, but helpen them, and con&s;treynen them to lead the people to hell-ward, by withdrawing of God's word, and by evil en&s;ample geving, they ben wei|ward traytors to God and his people, and
<PB N="92" REF="108">
vicars of Sathanas.&mdash; 2. Yet more traitery is in fal&s;e curates, that geven mede or hire to comen into &s;uch worldly offices, and to get lord&s;hip and maintenance agen&s;t ordinances, and couchen in lord's courts for to get mo fatte benefices, and purpo&s;en not &s;pedly to do their gho&s;tly office. Woe is to the lords that been led with &s;uch cur&s;ed heretics, an|tichri&s;ts, traytors of God and his people; and traytors to lords them&s;elves; who ben &s;o blinded, that they perceiven not that &s;uch traitors, that openly ben fal&s;e to God, wolen much more been fal&s;e to them. &mdash; 3. But the mo&s;t traitery is in fal&s;e confe&s;&s;ors, that &s;hulden by their office warn prelates, and lords of this great peril, and clerks al&s;o that they holden none &s;uch curates in their worldly offices. For they don not this, le&s;t they le&s;en lord&s;hip, and friend&s;hip, and gifts, and welfare of their &s;tinking belly; and &s;o they &s;ellen chri&s;ten &s;ouls to Sathanas, and maken prelates and lords, and curates to live in &s;in and traitery agen&s;t God and his people, and deceiven them in their &s;ouls health, and meyntenen them in cur&s;ed traitery of God and his people; and thus almo&s;t all the world goeth to hell for this cur&s;ed &s;ymony of fal&s;e
<PB N="93" REF="109">
confe&s;&s;ors. For commonly prelates, lords, and curates ben envenymed with this here&s;y of &s;ymony, and never done very repentance, and &s;atisfaction therefore. For when they have a fat benefice geten by &s;ymony, they for&s;aken it not as they ben bounden by law, but wittingly u&s;en forth that &s;ymony, and liven in riot, coveti&s;&s;e, and pride, and don not their office neither in good en&s;ample, ne in true teching. And thus antichri&s;t's clerks, enemies of Chri&s;t, and his people, by money, and flattering, and fle&s;hly love, gedring to them leading of the people, forbare true prie&s;ts to teche God's law, and therefore the blind leadeth the blind, and both parts run|nen into &s;in, and full many to hell: and it is huge wonder that God of his righteou&s;|ne&s;s de&s;troyeth not the hou&s;es of prelates, and lords, and curates, as Sodom and Go|mor for here&s;ie, extortions, and other cur|&s;edne&s;&s;es. And for dread of this &s;in, and many mo, &s;ome poor wretches receive no benefices in this world.</P>
<P N="2">II. Yet tho poor prie&s;ts mighten freely getten pre&s;entation of lords to have bene|fices with cure of &s;ouls, they dreaden of mi&s;pending poor mens goods. For prie&s;ts
<PB N="94" REF="110">
owen to hold them&s;elves paide with food, and cloathing, as St. Paul techeth; and if they have more it is poor mens goods, as their own law, and God's law &s;eyn, and they ben keepers thereof, and procurators of poor men. But for in&s;titution and in|duction he &s;hall give much of this good, that is poor men's, to bi&s;hops officers, arch|deacons, and officials, that ben too rich. And when bi&s;hops and their officers comen, and feynen to vi&s;it, tho they nouri&s;hen men in open &s;in for annual rent, and don not their office, but &s;ellen &s;ouls to Sathanas for money, wretched curates ben neded to fea&s;ten them richly, and give procuracy and &s;ynage, yea again&s;t God's law, and man's, and rea&s;on, and their own con&s;cience, and yet they &s;hullen not be &s;uffered to teche truly God's law to their own &s;ujects, and warn them of fal&s;e prophets, who deceiven them both in belief and teching: for then they mu&s;ten crie to the people the great &s;ins of prelates; but they demen that &s;uch &s;ad reproving of &s;in is envy, &s;landering of pre|lates, and de&s;troying of holy church. Al&s;o many times their patrons willen look to be fea&s;ted of &s;uch curates, el&s;e maken them
<PB N="95" REF="111">
le&s;e that little thing, that they and poor men &s;hullen live by. So that they &s;hullen not &s;pend their tithes and offerings after good con&s;cience, and God's laws, but wa&s;te them on rich and idle men. Al&s;o eche good day commonly the&s;e &s;mall curates &s;hullen have letters fro their ordinaries to &s;ummon, and to cur&s;e poor men for nought, but for coveti&s;&s;e of antichri&s;ts clerks; and if they not &s;umonen and cur&s;en them, tho they know no cau&s;e why they &s;hullen been hurt|ed, and &s;ummoned fro day to day, fro far place to farther, or cur&s;ed, or le&s;e their be|nefits or profits. For el&s;e, as prelates feinen, they by their rebeldy &s;hulden &s;oon de&s;troy prelates juri&s;diction, power, and winning. Al&s;o, when poor prie&s;ts, fir&s;t holy of life, and devout in their prayers, ben beneficed, if they ben not bu&s;y about the world to make great fea&s;ts to rich per&s;ons and vicars, and co&s;tly and gayly arrayed, by fal&s;e doom of the world, they &s;hullen be hated and hayned on as hounds, and ech man redy to peirc them in name, and worldly goods. So many cur&s;ed deceits hath antichri&s;t brought up by his worldly clerks to make curates to mi&s;pende poor mens goods, and
<PB N="96" REF="112">
not truly do their office; or el&s;e to for&s;aken all, and let antichri&s;t's clerks, as lords of this world, rob the poor people by feyned cen&s;ures, and teche the fend's lore both by open preching, and en&s;ample of cur&s;ed life. Al&s;o, if &s;uch curates ben &s;tirred to learn God's law, and teche their pari&s;hens the go&s;pel, commonly they &s;hullen get no leave of bi&s;hops, but for gold; and when they &s;hullen mo&s;t profit in their learning, then &s;hullen they be clepid home at the prelate's will. And if they &s;hullen have any high &s;acraments, commonly they &s;hulle buy them with poor mens goods; and &s;o there is full great peril of evil &s;pending of the&s;e goods, both upon prelates, rich men of the coun|try, patrons, par&s;ons, and their own kyn, for fame of the world, and for &s;hame, and evil deming of men. And certes it is great wonder that God &s;uffreth &s;o long this &s;in unpuni&s;hed, namely of prelates courts, that ben dens of thieves, and larders of hell; and &s;o of their officers, that ben &s;otil in malice and coveti&s;&s;e; and of lords, and mighty men, that &s;hulden de&s;troy this wrong and other, and meyntenen truth, and God's &s;er|vants, and now meyntenen antichri&s;t's fal&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="97" REF="113">
and his clerks, for part of the winning. But certes God &s;uffreth &s;uch hypocrites and tyrants to have name of prelates for great &s;ins of the people, that eche part lead other to hell by blindne&s;s of the fend. And this is a thou&s;and time more vengeance, than if God &s;hud de&s;troy bodily both parts, and all their goods, and earth therewith, as he did by Sodom and Gomor. For the longer that they liven thus in &s;in, the greater pains &s;hul|len they have in hell, unle&s;s they amenden them. &mdash;And this dread, and many mo, maken &s;ome poor prie&s;ts to receiven none benefices.</P>
<P N="3">III. But yet tho poor prie&s;ts mighten have freely pre&s;entation of lords, and ben holpen by meyntening of kings, and help of good commons fro extortions of prelates, and other mi&s;pending of the&s;e goods, that is full hard in this reigning of Antichri&s;t's clerks, yet they dreden fore that by &s;ingular cure or|dained of &s;inful men they &s;hulden be letted fro better occupation, and fro more profit of holy church. And this is the mo&s;t dread of all; for they have cure and charge at the full of God to help their brethren to heaven|ward, both by teching, praying, and exam|ple-geving.
<PB N="98" REF="114">
And it &s;eemeth that they &s;hul|len mo&s;t ea&s;ily fulfill this by general cure of charity, as did Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. And by this they mo&s;t &s;ikerly &s;ave them&s;elves, and help their brethren: and they ben free to flee fro one city to another, when they ben pur|&s;ued of antichri&s;t's clerks, as biddeth Chri&s;t in the go&s;pel. And they may be&s;t without challenging of men go and dwell among the people where they &s;hullen mo&s;t profit, and in covenable time come, and go after &s;tirring of the holy gho&s;t, and not be bounden by &s;inful mens juri&s;diction fro the better doing. Al&s;o they pur&s;uen Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles nearer, in taking alms wilfully of the people that they techen, than in taking dymes and offerings by cu&s;toms that &s;inful men ordey|nen, and u&s;en now in the time of grace. Al&s;o this is more medeful on both &s;ides as they under&s;tonden by Chri&s;ts life, and his apo&s;tles: for thus the people giveth them alms more wilfully and devoutly, and they taken it more mekely, and ben more bu&s;y to lerne, kepe and teche God's law, and &s;o it is the better for both &s;ides. Al&s;o by this manner might and &s;hulde the people geve freely their alms to true prie&s;ts that truly

<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the circum&s;tances of the times, in which Wicliff lived, the boundle&s;s u&s;urpations of the court of Rome, the additional power and glory of England, from its &s;ucce&s;&s;es again&s;t the French; and the more liberal &s;pirit, which was daily get|ting ground in its national councils, we need not wonder, that a genius, like Wicliff, de|tecting errors, and holding up truths, of &s;uch infinite importance, &s;hould engage the at|tention of mankind. Though few had the courage or abilities to inve&s;tigate the&s;e truths them&s;elves; yet many were ingenuous enough to clo&s;e with them, when they were offered to their under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>It is a common ob&s;ervation, that the vul|gar are generally the mo&s;t open to conviction. The great are attached to e&s;tabli&s;hments, in which their intere&s;ts are concerned: the
<PB N="102" REF="120">
learned to &s;y&s;tems, on which their time hath been &s;pent. We need not wonder there|fore, if we find few of any con&s;iderable eminence among the di&s;ciples of Wicliff.</P>
<P>Among his own countrymen, Sir John Oldca&s;tle, lord Cobham, is the mo&s;t re|markable. We meet indeed with greater names; as Joan dowager to the Black-prince, and Ann, queen to Richard II. But the&s;e, and &s;ome others, were rather his favourers, than profe&s;&s;ed di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>Sir John Oldca&s;tle was born in the reign of Edward III. He obtained his peerage by marrying the heire&s;s of that lord Cobham, who with &s;o much virtue and patrioti&s;m op|po&s;ed the tyranny of Richard II; with which nobleman he has been &s;ometimes con|founded.</P>
<P>With the e&s;tate and title of his father in law, he &s;eems al&s;o to have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his virtue and independent &s;pirit. In the early part of his life we find him warmly di&s;tin|gui&s;hing him&s;elf in the cau&s;e of religious liberty. The famous &s;tatute again&s;t provi|&s;ors, which had been enacted in the late reign, was now become, during the languid govern|ment
<PB N="103" REF="121">
of Richard, a mere dead letter. The lord Cobham with great &s;pirit undertook the revival of it; and through his per&s;ua&s;ion it was confirmed by parliament, and guarded by &s;everer penalties.</P>
<P>The news of what the Engli&s;h parliament was doing in this bu&s;ine&s;s gave a great alarm at Rome; and Boniface IX, who was then pope, di&s;patched a nuncio immediately to check their proceedings. This mini&s;ter at fir&s;t cajoled; and afterwards threatned; but the &s;pirit, which had been rai&s;ed in the par|liament, &s;upported it&s;elf, again&s;t both his artifices and his menaces.&mdash;This is the fir&s;t in&s;tance we meet with of lord Cobham's avowed di&s;like to the church of Rome.</P>
<P>Four years after he made a farther effort. A rebellion having di&s;covered it&s;elf in Ireland, the king pa&s;&s;ed over with an army. He had made one campaign, and was preparing to take the field early in the &s;pring of the year, 1395, when the arch-bi&s;hop of Canterbury arriving at his camp, intreated his return into England, to put a &s;top to the ruin of the church. By the ruin of the church the good primate meant the reformation of the clergy; which had been attempted, during the king's
<PB N="104" REF="122">
ab&s;ence, by the lord Cobham, Sir Richard Story, Sir Thomas Latimer, and others of the reforming party. The&s;e leaders having collected their &s;trength, had drawn up a num|ber of articles again&s;t the corruptions, which then prevailed among churchmen, and pre|&s;ented them, in the form of a remon&s;trance, to the commons. As they had many friends in the hou&s;e, and as their principal opponents were then abroad with the king, they thought it more than probable, that &s;omething might be done by the parliament, in con&s;equence of their petition. But the zeal of the clergy prevailed; and the king, who came in&s;tantly from Ireland, put an entire &s;top to the affair.</P>
<P>The partiality, which the lord Cobham thus di&s;covered on all occa&s;ions for the re|formers, ea&s;ily pointed him out to the clergy as the head of that party. Nor indeed did he make any &s;ecret of his opinions. It was publickly known, that he had been at great expence in collecting and tran&s;cribing the works of Wicliff, which he di&s;per&s;ed among the common people without any re&s;erve. It was publickly known al&s;o, that he maintained a great number of the di&s;ciples of Wicliff,
<PB N="105" REF="123">
as itinerant preachers in many parts of the country, particularly in the dioce&s;&s;es of Can|terbury, Roche&s;ter, London, and Hereford. The&s;e things drew upon him the re&s;entment of the whole eccle&s;ia&s;tical order, and made him more obnoxious to that body of men, than any other per&s;on at that time in Eng|land.</P>
<P>Nine years had now elap&s;ed, &s;ince Rich|ard II. had taken the government into his own hands. This entire interval he had con|&s;umed in one &s;teady incroachment (the only in&s;tance of &s;teadine&s;s he gave) upon the laws of his country. So many indeed, and &s;o gro&s;s were his indi&s;cretions, that it was commonly &s;aid by the people, their king was under &s;ome preternatural infatuation. But as old Speed very well remarks (a remark too which might equally have fallen, where that cautious wri|ter in matters of king&s;hip, would lea&s;t have cho&s;en it) <Q>when princes are wilful and &s;lothful, and their favourites flatterers, there needs no other enchantment to infatuate, yea to ruinate the greate&s;t monarchs.</Q> After repeated &s;trokes upon the expiring li|berties of the nation, a conclu&s;ive blow was &s;truck. The whole legi&s;lative power was in|tru&s;ted,
<PB N="106" REF="124">
by the act of a venal parliament, to the king, &s;ix peers, and three commoners. An iron &s;ceptre being thus forged, was im|mediately &s;haken over the people. It were triffing to mention in&s;tances of private op|pre&s;&s;ion: towns and counties were &s;eized at once. <Q>For a while, (&s;ays the judicious Rapin, rea&s;oning upon Richard's actions) five or fix hundred per&s;ons, who compo&s;e a parliament, and as many magi&s;trates of towns and counties, may &s;eem to an im|prudent prince the body of a nation; but a time will come, when every &s;ingle per|&s;on mu&s;t be taken into the account.</Q></P>
<P>That time was now come. The nation exa&s;perated beyond &s;ufferance, ca&s;t their eyes upon the duke of Lanca&s;ter, who was now in exile. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who &s;hared the &s;ame fate, undertook to in|form him of the de&s;igns of the malecontents in England. Henry, who had private, as well as public wrongs to revenge, put him|&s;elf without delay at the head of the enter|prize. His party &s;oon became numerous, and was in general attended by the good wi&s;hes of the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="125">Lord Cobham had always &s;hewn him&s;elf equally a friend to the civil and religious li|berties of his country. He had followed the &s;teps of his father in law in oppo&s;ing the tyrannical encroachments of Richard; who&s;e re&s;entment he had felt oftner than once. Convinced therefore of the feeblene&s;s and wickedne&s;s of tho&s;e hands, by which the &s;ceptre was &s;wayed, he was among the fir&s;t who attached them&s;elves to the fortunes of Henry, and was received by that prince with tho&s;e marks of favour, which a per&s;on of his con&s;equence might naturally expect.</P>
<P>When Henry IV. came to the crown, it was imagined by all men, that in his heart he inclined to the opinions of the reformers. But Henry was a prudent prince; and max|ims of policy were ever the rules of his con|&s;cience. He found, upon examining the &s;tate of parties in England, that the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical intere&s;t was the mo&s;t able to &s;upport his preten&s;ions; and without farther he&s;ita|tion attached him&s;elf to it. The clergy were high in their demands. Their friend&s;hip was not to be purcha&s;ed but at the price of blood. Lollardy &s;pread apace. The laws in being were unable to check its progre&s;s: and the
<PB N="108" REF="126">
king was given to under&s;tand, that his pro|tection would &s;ecure their loyalty. This lan|guage was intelligible enough; and it was ea&s;ily interpreted, that by the protection of the king, was meant a law to burn heretics.</P>
<P>The king di&s;covered no great reluctance; but the commons, among whom many thought favourably of Wicliff, were very aver&s;e from the&s;e &s;anguinary proceedings. At length however an act pa&s;&s;ed, impower|ing the clergy to the extent of their de&s;ires: yet it pa&s;&s;ed not but with the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of the king's authority. By this act the civil power was obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the execution of eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;entences. Mr. Fox indeed tells us, that he cannot find, it ever did pa&s;s the commons; but &s;uppo&s;es, that as parlia|mentary affairs were then managed with lit|tle regularity, it was huddled in among other acts, and &s;igned by the king without further notice.</P>
<P>That wicked and ambitious men &s;hould wade through blood to &s;upport either civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny, is too common a &s;ight to be matter of &s;urprize. But that any &s;et of men &s;hould &s;o far pervert their notions of right and wrong, as calmly to believe, that
<PB N="109" REF="127">
a few erroneous opinions could make a man in the highe&s;t degree criminal, however ex|cellent his life might be, is a thing altogether amazing. And yet charity obligeth us to believe, that many of the popi&s;h per&s;ecutors of tho&s;e times were thus per&s;uaded. <Q>The di&s;ciples of Wicliff, (&s;ays Reinher, a popi&s;h writer, are men of a &s;erious, mode&s;t de|portment, avoiding all o&s;tentation in dre&s;s, mixing little with the bu&s;y world, and com|plaining of the debauchery of mankind. They maintain them&s;elves wholly, (&s;ays he,) by their own labour, and utterly de&s;pi&s;e wealth: being fully content with bare nece&s;&s;aries. They are cha&s;te, and temperate; are never &s;een in taverns, or amu&s;ed by the trifling gaieties of life. Yet you find them always employed, either learning, or teaching. They are conci&s;e, and devout in their prayers, blaming an unanimated prolixity. They never &s;wear; &s;peak little; and in their public preaching lay the chief &s;tre&s;s on charity.</Q> All the&s;e things this writer mentions, with great &s;implicity, not as the marks of a virtuous conduct, but as the &s;igns of here&s;y.&mdash;A &s;triking in&s;tance this,
<PB N="110" REF="128">
among many others that might be produced from tho&s;e times, of the little regard paid to morals, in compari&s;on of opinions and outward ob&s;ervances.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding Henry's determination, at any rate, to keep the clergy in good hu|mour, he does not &s;eem to have di&s;covered any change towards lord Cobham, who was indeed one of the principal ornaments of his court.</P>
<P>In the year 1407, the king had an op|portunity of giving him a publick te&s;timony of his regard.</P>
<P>France was at this time a &s;cene of great di&s;order, through the competition of the Orlean and Burgundian factions. Henry remembring that the French had more than once in&s;ulted him, while he was in no con|dition to oppo&s;e them, re&s;olved, in the &s;pi|rit of retaliation, to avail him&s;elf of the&s;e troubles by a&s;&s;i&s;ting one of the contending parties. After balancing &s;ome time, he thought it be&s;t to join the duke of Burgundy. He rai&s;ed an army therefore with all &s;peed, and giving the command of it to the earl of Arundel, and lord Cobham, tran&s;ported it into France. Lord Cobham, it &s;eems, was
<PB N="111" REF="129">
not &s;o thorough a di&s;ciple of Wicliff, as to imbibe his opinions without re&s;erve. He had been bred to the profe&s;&s;ion of arms, and could not entirely reconcile him&s;elf to the peaceable tenets of his ma&s;ter. Perhaps, like many other ca&s;ui&s;ts, he indulged a fa|vourite point, and found arguments to make that indulgence lawful.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h army found the duke of Orleans be&s;ieging Paris, which was attached to the Burgundian intere&s;t. The relief there|fore of this city the Burgundian had greatly at heart. He communicated his views to the Engli&s;h generals, who readily came into them. A bold pu&s;h was accordingly made: the enemies lines were pierced; and the duke entered Paris at the head of his victorious army. This gallant action, in which the Engli&s;h had a principal &s;hare, put an end to the conte&s;t for this time. Orleans drew off his men; and waited for a more favourable opportunity of renewing the war.</P>
<P>Henry IV. died in the year 1413; in whom the clergy lo&s;t all their hopes. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or was a di&s;&s;olute prince, carele&s;s even of appearances &mdash; without que&s;tion therefore unconcerned about religion. Had heaven
<PB N="112" REF="130">
granted a few years more to his father's life, the church had been e&s;tabli&s;hed on a &s;olid ba&s;is. But now all was at an end. &mdash; Such were the fears and de&s;ponding murmurs of the clergy. But their hopes immediately re|vived. Henry V. was a per&s;on wholly dif|ferent from the prince of Wales. He di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed the companions of his loo&s;er hours; and with them his debauchery. No &s;enti|ments, but what were noble, great, and ge|nerous had any &s;way with him. And what was very remarkable, among his virtues, piety was con&s;picuous. This the clergy pre|&s;ently ob&s;erved; and re&s;olved to turn it to their own advantage.</P>
<P>Thomas Arundel was, at this time, arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury; and pre&s;ided over the church of England with as much zeal, and bigotry, as any of his predece&s;&s;ors. By his councils the convocation, which a&s;&s;embled in the fir&s;t year of the new king, were di|rected. The growth of here&s;y was the &s;ub|ject of their debate, and the de&s;truction of the lord Cobham the chief object which the archbi&s;hop had in view. It was an under|taking however, which required caution. The lord Cobham was a per&s;on in favour
<PB N="113" REF="131">
with the people; and, what was more, in favour with his prince. At pre&s;ent there|fore the primate &s;atisfied him&s;elf with &s;ound|ing the king's &s;entiments, by reque&s;ting an order from his maje&s;ty to &s;end commi&s;&s;ioners to Oxford, to enquire into the growth of here&s;y. To this reque&s;t the king made no objection.</P>
<P>Oxford was the &s;eat of here&s;y. Here the memory of Wicliff was &s;till gratefully pre|&s;erved. His learning, his eloquence, his la|bours, and noble fortitude were yet the ob|jects of admiration. His tenets had &s;pread widely among the junior &s;tudents, who&s;e in|genuity rendered them more open to con|viction. Nor indeed was it an uncommon thing to hear his opinions publicly maintained even in the &s;chools. The governing part of the univer&s;ity were however &s;till firmly at|tached to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners were re&s;pectfully re|ceived; and having made their enquiry, re|turned with the particulars of it to the arch|bi&s;hop, who laid them before the convoca|tion. Long debates en&s;ued &mdash; the re&s;ult was, that the increa&s;e of here&s;y was particularly owing to the influence of the lord Cobham,
<PB N="114" REF="132">
who not only avowedly held heretical opi+nions him&s;elf; but encouraged &s;cholars from Oxford, and other places, by bountiful &s;ti+pends, to propagate tho&s;e opinions in the country. In the end, it was determined, that without delay a pro&s;ecution &s;hould be commenced again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Into this ha&s;ty mea&s;ure the convocation had certainly run, had not a cool head among them &s;ugge&s;ted, that as the lord Cobham was not only a favourite, but even a dome&s;tic at court, it would be highly improper to proceed farther in this bu&s;ine&s;s, till application had been made to the king. This advice pre|vailed: the archbi&s;hop, at the head of a large proce&s;&s;ion of dignified eccle&s;ia&s;tics, waited upon Henry; and with as much acrimony as decency would admit, laid before him the offence of his &s;ervant the lord Cobham, and begged his maje&s;ty would &s;uffer them, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, to put him to death.</P>
<P>Some hi&s;torians have charged this prince with cruelty. In this in&s;tance at lea&s;t he &s;hewed lenity. He told the archbi&s;hop, he had ever been aver&s;e from &s;hedding blood in the cau&s;e of religion; &s;uch violence he thought more de&s;tructive of truth than error.
<PB N="115" REF="133">
He enjoined the convocation therefore, to po&s;tpone the affair a few days; in which time he would him&s;elf rea&s;on with the lord Cob|ham, who&s;e behaviour he by no means ap|proved; and if this were ineffectual, he would then leave him to the cen&s;ure of the church.</P>
<P>With this an&s;wer the primate was &s;atisfied; and the king &s;ending for the lord Cobham, endeavoured by all the arguments in his power, to &s;et before him the high offence of &s;eparating from the church; and pathe|tically exhorted him to retract his errors. Lord Cobham's an&s;wer is upon record. <Q>I ever was, (&s;aid he,) a dutiful &s;ubject to your maje&s;ty, and I hope ever will be. Next to God, I profe&s;s obedience to my king. But as for the &s;piritual dominion of the pope, I never could &s;ee on what foun|dation it is claimed, nor can I pay him any obedience. As &s;ure as God's word is true, to me it is fully evident, that he is the great antichri&s;t foretold in holy writ.</Q></P>
<P>This an&s;wer of the lord Cobham &s;o ex|ceedingly &s;hocked the king, that turning away in vi&s;ible di&s;plea&s;ure, he withdrew from
<PB N="116" REF="134">
that time, every mark of his favour from him.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop, thus triumphant, im|mediately cited the lord Cobham to appear before him on a fixed day: but that high-&s;pirited nobleman, expre&s;&s;ing great contempt for the archbi&s;hop's citation, would not even &s;uffer his &s;ummoner (as he is called) to enter his gate. Upon this the archbi&s;hop fixed the citation upon the doors of the cathedral of Roche&s;ter, which was only three miles from Cowling-ca&s;tle, the lord Cobham's &s;eat; but it was immediately torn away by unknown hands.</P>
<P>The day appointed for his appearance was the 11th of September, on which day the primate, and his a&s;&s;ociates, &s;at in con&s;i&s;tory. The accu&s;ed party not appearing, the arch|bi&s;hop pronounced him contumacious; and after receiving a very exaggerated charge again&s;t him, which he did not examine, he excommunicated him without further cere|mony. Having proceeded thus far, he armed him&s;elf with the terrors of the new law, and threatning direful anathemas, called in the civil power to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="135">Now fir&s;t the lord Cobham thought him|&s;elf in danger. He &s;aw the &s;torm approach|ing in all its horrors; and in vain looked round for &s;helter. Aided as the clergy were by the civil power, he knew it would be &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to ward off the meditated blow. Still however he had hope that the king's favour was not wholly alienated from him. At lea&s;t he thought it of importance to make the trial. He put in writing there|fore a confe&s;&s;ion of his faith; and with this in his hand, waited upon the king; begging his maje&s;ty to be the judge him&s;elf, whether he had de&s;erved the rough treatment he had found.</P>
<P>In this confe&s;&s;ion he fir&s;t recites the apo&s;tles creed; then, by way of explanation, he pro|fe&s;&s;es his belief in the trinity, and acknow|ledges Chri&s;t as the only head of the church, which he divides into the ble&s;&s;ed in heaven, tho&s;e who are tormented in purgatory, (if, &s;ays he, there is foundation in &s;cripture for any &s;uch place) and the righteous on earth. He then profe&s;&s;es to believe, that in the &s;a|crament of the Lord's &s;upper are contained Chri&s;t's body and blood under the &s;imilitude of bread and wine. <Q>Finally, (&s;ays he,)
<PB N="118" REF="136">
my faith is, that God will a&s;k no more of a Chri&s;tian in this life, than to obey the precepts of his ble&s;&s;ed law. If any pre|late of the church requireth more, or any other kind of obedience, he contemneth Chri&s;t, exalteth him&s;elf above God, and becometh plainly antichri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>This confe&s;&s;ion the lord Cobham offered to the king in the manner as hath been men|tioned. The king coldly ordered it to be given to the archbi&s;hop. Lord Cobham then offered to bring an hundred knights, who would bear te&s;timony to the innocence of his life, and of his opinions. The king be|ing &s;ilent, he a&s;&s;umed a higher &s;train, and begged his maje&s;ty would permit him, as was u&s;ual in le&s;s matters, to vindicate his innocence by the law of arms. The king continued &s;ilent.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant a per&s;on entered the cham|ber, and in the king's pre&s;ence cited lord Cobham to appear before the archbi&s;hop. It is probable this was a concerted bu&s;ine&s;s. Startled at the &s;uddenne&s;s of the thing, the lord Cobham made his la&s;t effort. <Q>Since I can have, (&s;aid he) no other ju&s;tice, I appeal to the pope at Rome.</Q> The king
<PB N="119" REF="137">
firing at this, cried out with vehemence, "Thou &s;halt never pro&s;ecute thy appeal." and lord Cobham refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit im|plicitly to the cen&s;ure of the church, was immediately hurried to the tower by the king's expre&s;s order.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething uncommonly &s;trange in the account here given us of lord Cob|ham's appeal to the pope, who&s;e &s;upremacy he had ever denyed. No con&s;i&s;tent rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for it. As to the fact how|ever, we have only its improbability to al|ledge again&s;t it.</P>
<P>On the 23d of September the primate, &s;itting in the chapter-hou&s;e of Paul's, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the bi&s;hops of London and Winche&s;ter, lord Cobham was brought before him by Sir Robert Morley, lieutenant of the tower.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop fir&s;t broke &s;ilence. <Q>Sir, (&s;aid he,) it was &s;ufficiently proved in a late &s;e&s;&s;ion of convocation, that you held many heretical opinions; upon which, agreeable to our forms, you were cited to appear before us; and refu&s;ing, you have been, for contumacy, excommunicated. Had you made proper &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, I was then ready to have ab&s;olved you, and am now.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="138">Lord Cobham, taking no notice of the offer of ab&s;olution, only &s;aid in an&s;wer, that if his lord&s;hip would give him leave, he would ju&s;t read his opinion on tho&s;e articles, about which he &s;uppo&s;ed he was called in que&s;tion; that any farther examination on tho&s;e points was needle&s;s, for he was en|tirely fixed, and &s;hould not be found to waver.</P>
<P>Leave being given, he read a paper, which contained his opinion on four points, the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper, penance, images, and pilgrimages.</P>
<P>With regard to the fir&s;t point, he held, as hath been already mentioned, that Chri&s;t's body was really contained under the form of bread. &mdash; With regard to the &s;econd, he thought penance for &s;in, as a &s;ign of con|trition, was u&s;eful and proper. &mdash; With re|gard to images, he thought them only allow|able to remind men of heavenly things; and that he who really paid divine wor&s;hip to them, was an idolater. &mdash; With regard to the la&s;t point, he &s;aid that all men were pilgrims upon earth towards happine&s;s or mi&s;ery; but that as to pilgrimages undertaken to the
<PB N="121" REF="139">
&s;hrines of &s;aints, they were frivolous, he thought, and ridiculous.</P>
<P>Having read this paper, he delivered it to the archbi&s;hop; who having examined it, told him, that what it contained was in part truly orthodox; but that in other parts he was not &s;ufficiently explicit. There were other points, the primate &s;aid, on which it was expected he &s;hould give his opinion.</P>
<P>Lord Cobham refu&s;ed to make any other an&s;wer; telling the archbi&s;hop, he was fixed in his opinions. <Q>You &s;ee me, (added he,) in your hands; and may do with me what you plea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>This re&s;olution, which he per&s;i&s;ted in, di&s;concerted the bi&s;hops. After a con&s;ulta|tion among them&s;elves, the primate told him, that on all the&s;e points holy church had determined; by which determination all Chri&s;tians ought to abide. He added, that for the pre&s;ent he would di&s;mi&s;s him, but &s;hould expect a more explicit an&s;wer on the monday following; and that in the mean time he would &s;end him, as a direction to his faith, the determination of the church upon tho&s;e points, on which his opinion would be particularly required.</P>

<HEAD>The determination of the archbi&s;hop, and the clergy.</HEAD>
<P>The faith and determination of the holy church touching the bli&s;sful &s;acrament of the altar, is this, that after the &s;acra|mental words be once &s;poken, the mate|rial bread, that was before bread, is turned into Chri&s;t's very body: and the material wine, that was before wine, is turned into Chri&s;t's very blood. And &s;o there re|maineth, from thenceforth, no material bread, nor material wine, which were there before the &s;acramental words were &s;poken. &mdash; Holy church hath determined, that every Chri&s;tian man ought to be &s;hriven to a prie&s;t, ordained by the church, if he may come to him. &mdash; Chri&s;t ordain|ed St. Peter the apo&s;tle, to be his vicar here on earth, who&s;e &s;ee is the holy church of Rome; and he granted, that the &s;ame power, which he gave unto Peter, &s;hould

&s;ucceed to all Peter's &s;uce&s;&s;ors, which we call now popes of Rome; by who&s;e power he ordained, in particular churches arch|bi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, par&s;ons, curates, and other degrees; whom Chri&s;tian men ought to obey after the laws of the church of Rome. This is the determination of holy church. &mdash; Holy church hath determined, that it is meritorious to a Chri&s;tian man to go on a pilgrimage to holy places; and there to wor&s;hip holy reliques, and images of &s;aints, apo&s;tles, martyrs, and confe&s;&s;ors, approved by the church of Rome.</P>

<P>On the day appointed the archbi&s;hop ap|peared in court, attended by three bi&s;hops, and four heads of religious hou&s;es. As if he had been apprehen&s;ive of popular tumult, he removed his judicial chair from the cathe|dral of Paul's, to a more private place in a dominican convent; and had the area croud|ed with a numerous throng of friars and monks, as well as &s;eculars.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the contemptuous looks of the&s;e fiery zealots, lord Cobham, attended by the lieutenant of the tower, walked up un|daunted to the place of hearing.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="142">With an appearance of great mildne&s;s the archbi&s;hop acco&s;ted him; and having, cur|&s;orily run over what had hitherto pa&s;&s;ed in the proce&s;s, told him, he expected, at their la&s;t meeting, to have found him &s;uing for ab&s;olution; but that the door of reconcilia|tion was &s;till open, if reflection had yet brought him to him&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q>I have tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t you in nothing, &s;aid the high-&s;pirited nobleman: I have no need of your ab&s;olution.</Q></P>
<P>Then kneeling down, and lifting up his hands to heaven, he broke out into this pa|thetic exclamation.</P>
<P><Q>I confe&s;s my&s;elf here before thee, O almighty God, to have been a grievous &s;inner. How often have ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions mi&s;led my youth! How often have I been drawn into &s;in by the tempta|tions of the world.&mdash;Here ab&s;olution is wanted. &mdash; O my God, I humbly a&s;k thy mercy.</Q></P>
<P>Then ri&s;ing up, with tears in his eyes, and &s;trongly affected with what he had ju&s;t uttered, he turned to the a&s;&s;embly, and &s;tretching out his arm, cryed out with a
<PB N="125" REF="143">
loud voice; <Q>Lo! the&s;e are your guides, good people. For the mo&s;t flagrant tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of God's moral law was I never once called in que&s;tion by them. I have expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome di&s;like to their arbi|trary appointments and traditions, and I am treated with unparallel'd &s;everity. But let them remember the denunciations of Chri&s;t again&s;t the Phari&s;ees; all &s;hall be fulfilled.</Q></P>
<P>The grandeur and dignity of his manner, and the vehemence with which he &s;poke, threw the court into &s;ome confu&s;ion The archbi&s;hop however attempted an awkward apology for his treatment of him: and then turning &s;uddenly to him, a&s;ked, what he thought of the paper, that had been &s;ent to him the day before? and particularly, what he thought of the fir&s;t article, with regard to the holy &s;acrament?</P>
<P><Q>With regard to the holy &s;acrament, (an&s;wered lord Cobham,) my faith is, that Chri&s;t &s;itting with his di&s;ciples, the night before he &s;uffered, took bread; and ble&s;|&s;ing it, brake it, and gave it to them, &s;aying, Take, eat, this is my body, which was given for you: do this in remem|brance
<PB N="126" REF="144">
of me. &mdash; This is my faith, &s;ir, with regard to the holy &s;acrament. I am taught this faith by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Paul.</Q></P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop then a&s;ked him, "Whe|ther, after the words of con&s;ecration, he believed there remained any <HI>material</HI> bread?"</P>
<P>The &s;criptures, &s;aid he, make no mention of the word <HI>material.</HI> I believe, as was ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the paper I gave in, that, after con&s;ecration, Chri&s;t's body remains in the <HI>form</HI> of bread.</P>
<P>Upon this a loud murmur aro&s;e in the a&s;&s;embly; and the words "Here&s;y, here&s;y," were heard from every part. One of the bi&s;hops e&s;pecially crying out with more than ordinary vehemence, <Q>That it was a foul here&s;y to call it bread;</Q> lord Cobham, who &s;tood near, interrupting him, &s;aid, <Q>St. Paul, the apo&s;tle, was as wi&s;e a man as you are, and perhaps as good a Chri&s;tian; and yet he, after the words of con&s;ecra|tion, plainly calls it <HI>bread.</HI> The <HI>bread,</HI> &s;aith he, that we break, is it not the com|munion of the body of Chri&s;t? St. Paul, he was an&s;wered, mu&s;t be otherwi&s;e un|der&s;tood; for it was &s;urely here&s;y to &s;ay
<PB N="127" REF="145">
&s;o.</Q>&mdash;Lord Cobham a&s;ked, <Q>How that appeared?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Why, &s;aid the other, it is again&s;t the determination of holy church.</Q>&mdash;<Q>You know, &s;ir, interrupted the arch|bi&s;hop, we &s;ent you the true faith on this point, clearly determined by the church, and holy doctors.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I know none holier, replied lord Cobham, than Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles; and this determination is &s;urely none of theirs. It is plainly again&s;t &s;crip|ture.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Do you not then believe in the determination of the church?</Q>&mdash;<Q>I do not. I believe the &s;criptures; and all that is founded upon them: but in your idle determinations I have no belief. To be &s;hort with you, I cannot con&s;ider the church of Rome as any part of the Chri&s;tian church. Its endeavour is to oppo&s;e the purity of the go&s;pel, and to &s;et up, in its room, I know not what ab|&s;urd con&s;titutions of its own.</Q></P>
<P>This free declaration threw the whole a&s;&s;embly into great di&s;order. Every one exclaimed again&s;t the audacious heretic. Among others, the prior of the Carmelites, lifting up his eyes to heaven, cried out,
<PB N="128" REF="146">
<Q>What de&s;perate wretches are the&s;e &s;cholars of Wicliff?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Before God and man, (an&s;wered lord Cobham, with vehemence,) I here profe&s;s, that before I knew Wicliff, I never ab|&s;tained from &s;in; but after I was acquainted with that virtuous man, I &s;aw my errors, and I hope reformed them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It were an hard thing, replied the prior, if in an age &s;o liberally &s;upplied with pious and learned men, I &s;hould not be able to amend my life, till I heard the devil preach.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Go on, go on, (an&s;wered lord Cobham with &s;ome warmth;) follow the &s;teps of your fathers, the old Phari&s;ees. A&s;cribe, like them, every thing good to the devil, that oppo&s;es your own iniquities. Pro|nounce them heretics, who rebuke your crimes: and if you cannot prove them &s;uch by &s;cripture, call in the fathers. &mdash; Am I too &s;evere? Let your own actions &s;peak. What warrant have you from &s;cripture for this very act you are now about? Where do you find it written in all God's law, that you may thus &s;it in judgment upon

the life of man? &mdash; Hold &mdash; Annas and Caiphas may perhaps be quoted in your &s;avour.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ay, (&s;aid one of the doctors,) and Chri&s;t too, for he judged Judas.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I never heard that he did, (&s;aid lord Cobham.). He pronounced indeed a woe again&s;t him, as he doth &s;till again&s;t you, who have followed Judas's &s;teps: for &s;ince his venom hath been &s;hed in the church, you have vilely betrayed the cau&s;e of real Chri&s;tianity.</Q></P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop de&s;ired him to explain what he meant by venom?</P>
<P><Q>I mean by it, (&s;aid lord Cobham,) the wealth of the church. When the church was fir&s;t endowed, (as an author of your own pathetically expre&s;&s;es it) an angel in the air, cryed out, woe, woe, woe: This day is venom &s;hed into the church of God. Since that time, in&s;tead of laying down their lives for religion, as was common in the early ages, the bi&s;hops of Rome have been engaged in a con&s;tant &s;cene of per|&s;ecution, or in cur&s;ing, murdering, poi&s;on|ing, or fighting with each other. &mdash; Where is now the meekne&s;s of Chri&s;t, his ten|derne&s;s,
<PB N="130" REF="148">
and indulgent gentlene&s;s? not in Rome certainly.</Q></P>
<P>Then rai&s;ing his voice, he cried out, <Q>Thus &s;aith Chri&s;t in his go&s;pel, woe unto you, &s;cribes, and phari&s;ees, hypocrites, you &s;hut up the kingdom of heaven again&s;t men: you neither enter in your&s;elves, neither will you &s;uffer tho&s;e to enter, who otherwi&s;e would. You &s;top the way by your traditions: you hinder God's true mini&s;ters from &s;etting the truth before the people. But let the prie&s;t be ever &s;o wicked, if he defend your tyranny, he is &s;uffered.</Q></P>
<P>Then looking &s;tedfa&s;tly upon the arch|bi&s;hop, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, he &s;aid, <Q>Both Daniel, and Chri&s;t have prophe&s;ied, that trouble&s;ome times &s;hould come, &s;uch as had not been from the foundation of the world. &mdash; This prophe&s;y &s;eems in a great mea&s;ure fulfilled in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the church. &mdash; You have greatly troubled the people of God: you have already dipped your hands in blood; and, if I fore&s;ee aright, will &s;till farther embrue them. But there is a threat on record again&s;t you: therefore look to it: your days &s;hall be
<PB N="131" REF="149">
&s;hortened.&mdash;For the elects &s;ake your days &s;hall be &s;hortened.</Q></P>
<P>The very great &s;pirit, and re&s;olution with which lord Cobham behaved on this occa&s;ion, together with the quickne&s;s and pertinence of his an&s;wers, Mr. Fox tells us, &s;o amazed his adver&s;aries, that they had nothing to re|ply. The archbi&s;hop was &s;ilent. The whole court was at a &s;tand.</P>
<P>At la&s;t one of the doctors, taking a copy of the paper which had been &s;ent to the tower, and turning to lord Cobham, told him, That the de&s;ign of their pre&s;ent meet|ing was not to &s;pend the time in idle alterca|tion; but to come to &s;ome conclu&s;ion. <Q>We only, (&s;aid he,) de&s;ire to know your, opi|nion upon the points contained in this paper.</Q> He then de&s;ired a direct an&s;wer, whether, after the words of con&s;ecration, there remained any material bread.?</P>
<P><Q>I have told you, (an&s;wered lord Cob|ham,) my belief is, that Chri&s;t's body is contained under the <HI>form</HI> of bread.</Q></P>
<P>He was again a&s;ked, whether he thought confe&s;&s;ion to a prie&s;t of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity?</P>
<P>He &s;aid, he thought it might be in many ca&s;es u&s;eful to a&s;k the opinion of a prie&s;t, if
<PB N="132" REF="150">
he were a learned and pious man; but he thought it by no means nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alva|tion.</P>
<P>He was then que&s;tioned about the pope's right to St. Peter's chair.</P>
<P><Q>He that followeth Peter the nighe&s;t in good living, (he an&s;wered,) is next him in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. You talk, &s;aid he, of Peter; but I &s;ee none of you that followeth his lowly manners; nor indeed the manners of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, till the time of Syl|ve&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>"But what do you affirm of the pope?"</P>
<P><Q>That he and you together, (replied lord Cobham,) make whole the great antichri&s;t. He is the head, you bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts are the body, and the begging friers are the tail, that covers the filthine&s;s of you both with lies and &s;ophi&s;try.</Q></P>
<P>He was la&s;tly a&s;ked, what he thought of the wor&s;hip of images and holy relicts?</P>
<P><Q>I pay them, (an&s;wered lord Cobham,) no manner of regard. &mdash; Is it not, &s;aid he, a wonderful thing, that the&s;e &s;aints, &s;o di&s;|intere&s;ted upon earth, &s;hould after death become &s;uddenly &s;o covetous?&mdash;It would
<PB N="133" REF="151">
indeed be wonderful, did not the plea&s;ure|able lives of prie&s;ts account for it.</Q></P>
<P>Having thus an&s;wered the four articles, the archbi&s;hop told him, that, he found lenity was indulged to no purpo&s;e. <Q>The day, (&s;ays he) is wearing apace: we mu&s;t come to &s;ome conclu&s;ion. Take your choice of this alternative; &s;ubmit obediently to the orders of the church, or endure the con|&s;equence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My faith is fixed, (an&s;wered lord Cob|ham aloud) do with me what you plea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop then &s;tanding up, and taking off his cap, pronounced aloud the cen&s;ure of the church.</P>
<P>Lord Cobham, with great chearfulne&s;s, an&s;wered, <Q>You may condemn my body: my &s;oul, I am well a&s;&s;ured, you cannot hurt.</Q>&mdash;Then turning to the people, and &s;tretching out his hands, he cryed out with a loud voice, <Q>Good Chri&s;tian people, for God's &s;ake be well aware of the&s;e men; they will otherwi&s;e beguile you, and lead you to de&s;truction.</Q> Having &s;aid this, he fell on his knees, and, rai&s;ing his hands, and eyes, begged God to forgive his enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="152">He was then delivered to Sir Robert Morley, and &s;ent back to the tower.</P>
<P>The&s;e proceedings of the clergy were very unpopular. Few men were generally more e&s;teemed than lord Cobham. His great virtues would have gained him re&s;pect, had his opinions been di&s;reputable. But the tenets of Wicliff had, at this time, many advocates. The clergy therefore were in &s;ome degree perplexed. They &s;aw the bad con&s;equences of going farther, but &s;aw wor&s;e con&s;equences in receding. What &s;eemed be&s;t, and was indeed mo&s;t agreeable to the genius of popery, was, to endeavour to le&s;&s;en his credit among the people. With this view many &s;candalous a&s;per&s;ions were &s;pread abroad by their emi&s;&s;aries. Mr. Fox tells us, they &s;crupled not even to publi&s;h a recantation in his name; and gives us a copy of it. Lord Cobham, in his own defence, had the following paper po&s;ted up in &s;ome of the mo&s;t public places in London.</P>
<P><Q>Fora&s;much as &s;ir John Oldca&s;tle, lord Cobham, is untruly convicted, and im|pri&s;oned, fal&s;ely reported of, and &s;landered among the common people by his adver|&s;aries,
<PB N="135" REF="153">
that he &s;hould otherwi&s;e &s;peak of the &s;acraments of the church, and e&s;pe|cially of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;acrament of the altar, than was written in the confe&s;&s;ion of his belief; known be it here to all the world, that he hath never &s;ince varied in any point therefrom, but this is plainly his belief, that all the &s;acraments of the church be profitable, and expedient al&s;o to all, taking them after the intent that Chri&s;t and his true church hath ordained. Furthermore he believeth, that the ble&s;&s;ed &s;acrament of the altar, is verily and truly Chri&s;t's body in the form of bread.</Q></P>
<P>Some months had now elap&s;ed, &s;ince lord Cobham had been condemned: nor did the primate and his clergy &s;eem to have come to any re&s;olution. They thought it imprudent yet to proceed to extremities.</P>
<P>Out of this perplexity, their pri&s;oner him|&s;elf extricated them. By unknown means he e&s;caped out of the tower, and taking the advantage of a dark night, evaded pur&s;uit, and arrived &s;afe in Wales; where, under the protection of &s;ome of the chiefs of the country, he &s;ecured him&s;elf again&s;t the at|tempts of his enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="154">This, it may ea&s;ily be imagined, was a &s;en&s;ible mortification to the clergy; and great pains were taken to per&s;uade the king to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation again&s;t him. But the king, who probably thought, that enough had been done already, paid only little at|tention to what was urged; and &s;hewed no inclination to afford his countenance in ap|prehending him.</P>
<P>This was &s;till a greater mortification. They remembred the wicked attempts made again&s;t them by the commons in the la&s;t reign; and dreaded the revival of them. The lea&s;t coolne&s;s in the king, they knew, would be a &s;ignal to their enemies: and it was the part of prudence, to &s;pare no pains in alienating him from the Lollards.</P>
<P>Jealou&s;y, the natural companion of u&s;urp|ed power, was the ruling foible of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter. This the clergy had ob&s;erved; and thought they could not do better than to repre&s;ent the Lollards as ill-inclined to the government. The king lent an ear to their whi&s;pers, and began to eye the&s;e unfortunate men with that caution, with which he guard|ed again&s;t his greate&s;t enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="155">Among other in&s;tances of the zeal of the clergy in propagating calumny, the follow|ing &s;tory, attended by very extraordinary circum&s;tances, is related.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hops had lately obtained a procla|mation, forbidding the Lollards to a&s;&s;emble in companies; which they had commonly done for the &s;ake of devotion. The pro|clamation had in part only its effect: they &s;till continued to a&s;&s;emble; but in le&s;s com|panies, more privately; and often in the dead of night. St. Giles's fields, then a thicket, was a place of frequent re&s;ort on the&s;e occa|&s;ions. Here about an hundred of them had met one evening, with an intention, as was u&s;ual, to continue their meeting to a very late hour. Emi&s;&s;aries, mixing with them under the di&s;gui&s;e of friends, &s;oon gave in|telligence of their de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The king was then at Eltham, a few miles from London. As he was &s;itting down to &s;upper, advice was brought him, that the lord Cobham, at the head of 20,000 men, had taken po&s;t in St. Giles's fields, breath|ing revenge, and threatening to murder the king, the princes of the blood, and all the
<PB N="138" REF="156">
lords, &s;piritual, and temporal, who &s;hould oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>The king, not con&s;idering how impro|bable it was, that &s;uch an army could have been gotten together without earlier notice; and having few about him to advi&s;e with, con&s;ulted only the gallantry of his own tem|per, and took a &s;udden re&s;olution to arm what men he could readily mu&s;ter, and put him&s;elf at their head; hoping to &s;urprize the rebels before they had concerted their &s;chemes. Soon after midnight he arrived upon the place, and fell with great &s;pirit upon what he &s;uppo&s;ed the advanced guard of the enemy. They were &s;oon thrown into confu&s;ion, and yielded an ea&s;y victory. About twenty were killed, and &s;ixty taken; the chief leader of whom was one Beverly, a preacher. Flu&s;hed with this &s;ucce&s;s, the king marched on towards the main body. But no main body was found; and this for|midable army was di&s;per&s;ed as ea&s;ily as it had been rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>This &s;trange affair, we may imagine, is differently related by different party-writers. The popi&s;h hi&s;torians talk of it, as of a real

con&s;piracy; and exclaim loudly again&s;t tenets, which could encourage &s;uch crimes. Among the&s;e the ingenious Mr. Hume has cho&s;en to li&s;t him&s;elf; and on no better authority than Wal&s;ingham, a mere bigot, hath without any he&s;itation charged lord Cobam with high-trea&s;on.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the prote&s;tant writers, in general, treat the whole as a fiction, and cen&s;ure their adver&s;aries with great acrimony for &s;o malicious an a&s;per&s;ion.</P>
<P>The papi&s;ts, put to proof, alledge, that arms were found upon the field; and that many of the pri&s;oners made open confe&s;&s;ion of the wickedne&s;s of their intentions.</P>
<P>As to arms, reply the prote&s;tants, it is a &s;tale trick to hide them on purpo&s;e to &s;erve an occa&s;ion by finding them: and as to con|fe&s;&s;ions, nothing is more common, than to extort them from innocent per&s;ons. Be&s;ides, they might have been drawn from popi&s;h emi&s;&s;aries, mixing among the Wiclivites, with the very intention of being brought to confe&s;&s;ion. <Q>In truth, (&s;ays the judicious Rapin, rea&s;oning upon this fact) it is hardly to be conceived, that a prince &s;o wi&s;e as Henry, could &s;uffer him&s;elf to be impo&s;ed

upon by &s;o gro&s;s a fiction. Had he found indeed, as he was made to believe, 20,000 men in arms in St. Giles's field, it might have created &s;u&s;picion; but that four&s;core, or an hundred men, among whom there was not a &s;ingle per&s;on of rank, &s;hould have formed &s;uch a project, is extremely improbable. Be&s;ides, he him&s;elf knew &s;ir John Oldca&s;tle to be a man of &s;en&s;e; and yet nothing could be more wild than the project fathered upon him; a project, which it was &s;uppo&s;ed he was to execute with a handful of men, and yet he him|&s;elf ab&s;ent, and no leader in his room. Be&s;ides, notwith&s;tanding the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch made through the kingdom, to di&s;cover the accomplices of this pretended con&s;pi|racy, not a &s;ingle per&s;on could be found, be&s;ides tho&s;e taken at St. Giles's. La&s;tly, the principles of the Lollards were very far from allowing &s;uch barbarities. It is therefore more than probable, that the accu&s;ation was forged to render the Lollards odious to the king, with a view to obtain his licence for their pro&s;ecution.</Q></P>
<P>It would be tedious to &s;ay all that might be &s;aid in defence of Lord Cobham on this
<PB N="141" REF="159">
occa&s;ion. Mr. Fox, in the fir&s;t volume of his acts and monuments, hath given us a very laboured, and &s;atisfactory vindication of him. He examines fir&s;t the &s;tatutes and authentic records, and afterwards the earlie&s;t hi&s;torians, from all which he draws a very conclu&s;ive argument, that there was no con|&s;piracy intended. The title of Mr Fox's tract is, <HI>A defence of lord Cobham again&s;t Alanus Copus.</HI></P>
<P>As improbable however as this con&s;piracy was, it was, for a time at lea&s;t, entirely cre|dited by the king, and fully an&s;wered the de&s;igns of the clergy. It thoroughly incen&s;ed Henry again&s;t the Lollards; and gave a very &s;evere check to the whole party. As for lord Cobham him&s;elf, the king was &s;o per&s;uaded of his guilt, that through his influence, a bill of attainder again&s;t him pa&s;&s;ed the com|mons, as appears from an old parliamentary record, pre&s;erved in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum. And not &s;atisfied with this, Henry &s;et a price of a thou&s;and marks upon his head; and promi&s;ed a perpetual exemption from taxes to any town, that &s;hould &s;ecure him.&mdash;This affair happened in the year 1414.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="160">In a few months after, a parliament was called at Leice&s;ter. Hither the zeal of the clergy followed the king. In pur&s;uance of their old &s;cheme of rendering the Lollards &s;u&s;pected as enemies to the &s;tate, they had a bill brought in, by which here&s;y &s;hould in|cur the forfeitures of trea&s;on. This bill like|wi&s;e made tho&s;e liable to the &s;ame penalties, who had broken pri&s;on, after having been convicted of here&s;y, unle&s;s they rendered them&s;elves again. This clau&s;e was evidently aimed at the lord Cobham.</P>
<P>To this bill the clergy fore&s;aw a furious oppo&s;ition from the Lollards, who bore no incon&s;iderable &s;way in the hou&s;e. Great there|fore was their &s;urprize, when they found their bill pa&s;&s;ed without any ob&s;tacle. Their pulpits rang with the prai&s;es of the parlia|ment; and they congratulated each other upon the glorious pro&s;pect of the church, when every branch of the legi&s;lature united in their endeavours to extirpate here&s;y. &mdash; But the clergy were much deceived in their opinion of the commons, who acted in this bu&s;ine&s;s with great addre&s;s.</P>
<P>It had long been the favourite &s;cheme of a majority in the hou&s;e, to &s;trip the clergy of
<PB N="143" REF="161">
their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and in this majority many were found, who were by no means inclined to the opinions of Wicliff. The&s;e men were too much patriots to wi&s;h their country en|&s;laved by an oppre&s;&s;ive hierarchy; and &s;aw no way of e&s;caping &s;uch bondage, but by wringing from the church that wealth, which was the &s;ource of its power. Friends to its &s;piritual juri&s;diction, they cavilled only at its temporal.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e &s;entiments, the commons, though twice foiled in the late reign, were not di&s;couraged. Their di&s;appointment put them only upon a change of mea&s;ures. The zeal which the reformers had &s;hewn in par|liament again&s;t the unbounded wealth of re|ligious hou&s;es, had heretofore furni&s;hed the clergy with a pretence for clamouring, "That all was virulence again&s;t the church." To this clamour the late king paid great re|gard. The leading members therefore of this parliament re&s;olved fir&s;t to exculpate them&s;elves of the charge of here&s;y; and having done this, they imagined they might with much greater facility, put their de&s;igns in execution: and on this principle they gave way to the clergy in their late act.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="162">Their intention was not long a my&s;tery In the mid&s;t of the prai&s;es be&s;towed upon them; while the clergy were every where extolling them as the wi&s;e&s;t, and mo&s;t re|&s;pectable body of men that ever met toge|ther, how were they thunder&s;truck, when they heard, that the&s;e wi&s;e and re&s;pectable men, had almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly pre&s;ented a petition to the king to &s;eize the revenues of the clergy? This was an unexpected blow. Something however was to be done, and that in&s;tantly. The king had di&s;covered no marks of di&s;plea&s;ure at the petition; which was a dreadful omen.</P>
<P>It was matter of joy to all good catholics, that Henry Chicheley was now archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. This prelate had &s;ucceeded Arundel; and to the zeal of his predece&s;&s;or, added a more artful addre&s;s in the manage|ment of affairs. Such addre&s;s was the prin|cipal thing, at that time, required in an arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury.</P>
<P>Undaunted at the &s;torm, this able pilot &s;tepped to the helm; and judging it advi&s;e|able to give up a part rather than hazard the whole, he went to the king; and with all humility hoped, "His maje&s;ty did not mean
<PB N="145" REF="163">
&s;o ra&s;h a thing, as to put it out of the power of his old friends to &s;erve him as they had ever done: the clergy were his &s;ure refuge upon all occa&s;ions; and as a proof of their zeal, they begged his maje&s;ty would accept at their hands, a &s;urrender of all the alien priories; which being not fewer than an hun|dred and ten, would very con&s;iderably aug|ment his revenues." Henry pau&s;ed, &mdash; and con&s;idering the noble &s;acrifice they had offer|ed, and reflecting upon the old maxim of prudence, that a &s;ecurity, though of le&s;s va|lue, is better than a contingence; &mdash; and withal, dreading the con&s;equences of irri|tating &s;o powerful a body, he accepted their offer; and the clergy had once more the plea&s;ure to &s;ee their arts counterbalance the de&s;igns of their enemies.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop, however, not yet &s;uffici|ently &s;ecure, proceeded a &s;tep farther. He ob&s;erved, from the times, a general inclina|tion to a French war, and wanted thoroughly to embark his &s;overeign in &s;uch an enterprize; rightly judging, that &s;chemes abroad would divert him from &s;chemes at home; and that a war upon the continent would greatly in|duce
<PB N="146" REF="164">
him to leave all quiet in his own dominions.</P>
<P>Thus re&s;olved, he took an early opportu|nity to addre&s;s the king in full parliament. In a &s;tudied harangue he proved the claim, which England had upon France, &s;ince the time of Edward III. The neglect of that claim, he &s;aid, &s;ince that period, had by no means injured the right. He then launched out into a florid encomium upon the virtues of the king; and &s;aid, the thunder of the Engli&s;h nation, which had &s;lept through two reigns, was re&s;erved &s;olely for his arm; and God would pro&s;per the noble undertaking. He concluded with &s;aying, that if his ma|je&s;ty &s;hould engage in this gallant enterprize, he would undertake, that the clergy &s;hould grant him a larger &s;ub&s;idy than had been ever granted to an Engli&s;h king; and he doubted not but the laity would follow their exam|ple.</P>
<P>Many hi&s;torians have attributed the con|que&s;t of France to this &s;peech. It is certain however, it greatly tended to reconcile the minds of men to this enterprize, and effectually put a &s;top to the king's de&s;igns
<PB N="147" REF="165">
again&s;t the church &mdash; Such were the vile po|litics of the clergy of tho&s;e times!</P>
<P>In the mean time lord Cobham, who&s;e &s;pirit in parliament had given birth to all this ferment, remained an exile in Wales, &s;hift|ing frequently the &s;cene of his retreat. In the &s;imple manners of that mountainous country he found an a&s;ylum, which he judg|ed it imprudent to exchange for one, which might probably prove more hazardous be|yond &s;ea.</P>
<P>But the zeal of his enemies was not ea&s;ily baffled. After many fruitle&s;s attempts, they engaged the lord Powis in their intere&s;t, a very powerful per&s;on in tho&s;e parts; and in who&s;e lands the lord Cobham was &s;uppo&s;ed to lie concealed.</P>
<P>This nobleman working upon his tenants by &s;uch motives, as the great have ever in re&s;erve, had numbers &s;oon upon the watch. This vigilance the lord Cobham could not e&s;cape. In the mid&s;t of his fancied &s;ecurity, he was taken, carried to London in triumph, and put into the hands of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury.</P>
<P>Lord Cobham had now been four years in Wales, but found his &s;ufferings had in no
<PB N="148" REF="166">
degree dimini&s;hed the malice of his enemies. On the contrary, it &s;hewed it&s;elf in &s;tronger colours. Tho&s;e re&s;traints, under which the clergy acted before, were now removed. The &s;uperiority which they had obtained, both in the parliament, and in the cabinet, laid every murmur a&s;leep; and they would boa&s;t, in the prophet's language, that not a dog dur&s;t move his tongue again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Things being thus circum&s;tanced, lord Cobham, without any divination, fore&s;aw his fate. His fate indeed remained not long in &s;u&s;pence. With every in&s;tance of bar|barous in&s;ult, which enraged &s;uper&s;tition could invent, he was dragged to execution. St. Giles's fields was the place appointed; where both as a traitor, and a heretic, he was hung up in chains alive upon a gallows; and, fire being put under him, was burnt to death.</P>
<P>Such was the unworthy fate of this no|bleman; who, though every way qualified to be the ornament of his country, fell a &s;acrifice to unfeeling rage, and barbarous &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>Lord Cobham had been much conver&s;ant in the world; and had probably been en|gaged,
<PB N="149" REF="167">
in the early part of his life, in the licence of it. His religion however put a thorough re&s;traint upon a di&s;po&s;ition, natu|rally inclined to the allurements of plea&s;ure. He was a man of a very high &s;pirit, and warm temper; neither of which his &s;uffer|ings could &s;ubdue. With very little tempo|rizing he might have e&s;caped the indignities he received from the clergy, who always con&s;idered him as an object beyond them: but the greatne&s;s of his &s;oul could not brook conce&s;&s;ion. In all his examinations, and through the whole of his behaviour, we &s;ee an authority and dignity in his manner, which &s;peak him the great man in all his afflictions.</P>
<P>He was a per&s;on of uncommon parts, and very exten&s;ive talents; well qualified either for the cabinet or the field. In conver&s;ation he was remarkable for his ready and poignant wit.</P>
<P>His acquirements were equal to his parts. No &s;pecies of learning, which was at that time in e&s;teem, had e&s;caped his attention. It was his thir&s;t of knowledge indeed, which fir&s;t brought him acquainted with the opini|ons of Wicliff. The novelty of them en|gaged
<PB N="150" REF="168">
his curio&s;ity. He examined them as a philo&s;opher, and in the cour&s;e of his ex|amination became a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>In a word, we cannot but con&s;ider lord Cobham as having had a principal hand in giving &s;tability to the opinions he embraced. He &s;hewed the world, that religion was not merely calculated for a cloi&s;ter, but might be introduced into fa&s;hionable life; and that it was not below a gentleman to run the la&s;t hazard in its defence.</P>

<HEAD><PB N="151" REF="170">The life of John Hu&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given &s;ome account of the opinions of Wicliff in England; let us follow the cour&s;e of them abroad. In Bohemia particularly, we &s;hall find they ob|tained great credit; where they were propa|gated by John Hu&s;s, Jerome of Prague, and others of le&s;s note.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed indeed, tho&s;e Bohe|mian reformers made little change in the opinions they found prevailing in their own church. Every &s;tep they took was taken with extreme caution; and many of the Romi&s;h writers have been led from hence to que&s;tion the propriety of ranking them in a catalogue of reformers. To rail at the po|pi&s;h clergy, we are told, hath ever been thought enough to give a man a place in this li&s;t. But this is making outca&s;ts indeed of the&s;e celebrated enquirers after truth. The papi&s;ts burnt their bodies, and damned their &s;ouls for being prote&s;tants, and would have
<PB N="152" REF="171">
prote&s;tants damn their memory for being papi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Unconcerned at the reproach, the pro|te&s;tants receive them with open arms, and con&s;ider them as tho&s;e noble leaders, who made the fir&s;t inroads into the regions of darkne&s;s; as tho&s;e who held up lights, tho' only faint and glimmering, which encouraged others to pur&s;ue their paths.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider &s;uch only as prote&s;tant, who&s;e opinions were <HI>thoroughly</HI> reformed, it is hard to &s;ay where the reformation began. Our Saviour con&s;iders tho&s;e as <HI>for him, who were not again&s;t him:</HI> much more rea&s;on have the prote&s;tants to con&s;ider the&s;e Bohe|mians of their party, who, for the &s;ake of opinions, which have been &s;ince adopted by prote&s;tants, &s;uffered the extremes of malice from papi&s;ts; and who maintained principles, which would have led them, if they had not been cut off by their enemies, to a full di&s;|covery of that truth they aimed at.</P>
<P>John Hu&s;s was born near Prague, in Bo|hemia, about the year 1376, at a village called Hu&s;&s;inez, upon the borders of the black fore&s;t; from which village he had his name.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="172">His father was a per&s;on in low circum|&s;tances; but took more care than is u&s;ually taken among &s;uch per&s;ons, in the education of his &s;on. He lived not however to &s;ee the fruit of his pains. After his death, his widow pur&s;ued his intention; and found means to &s;end her &s;on, though with diffi|culty enough even in the lowe&s;t &s;tation, to the univer&s;ity of Prague.</P>
<P>Here a very extraordinary piety began to di&s;tingui&s;h him. Among other in&s;tances of it, a &s;tory is recorded, the truth of which is the rather to be &s;u&s;pected, as we meet with frequent relations of the &s;ame kind in mar|tyrologies. As he was reading the life of St. Lawrence, we are told, he was &s;o &s;trong|ly affected with the con&s;tancy of that pious man in the mid&s;t of his &s;ufferings, that he thru&s;t his hand into the flame of a fire, by which he &s;at, and held it there, till his fel|low di&s;ciple, who was &s;itting by him, in great terror interfered. <Q>I had only, (&s;aid Hu&s;s,) an inclination to try, whether I had con|&s;tancy to bear an incon&s;iderable part of what this martyr underwent.</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1396 he took the degree of ma&s;ter of arts; and, &s;oon after, that of
<PB N="154" REF="173">
batchelor of divinity. In 1400 his abilities and piety had &s;o far recommended him, that he was cho&s;en confe&s;&s;or to the queen: and eight years after he was elected rector of the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of the&s;e honours, he obtained a benefice likewi&s;e. John Mulheym, a per&s;on of large fortune in Prague, built a chapel, which he called Bethelem; and having endowed it in a very ample manner, appointed Hu&s;s the mini&s;ter of it.</P>
<P>Whatever religious &s;cruples he might at this time have had, he had thus far kept them to him&s;elf. It is more than probable he had none of con&s;equence. The &s;uper|&s;titions of popery reigned &s;till, in all tran|quillity, in Bohemia; where the opinions of Wicliff, which had long been fermenting in England, were yet unknown.</P>
<P>In the year 1381, Richard II of England married Ann, &s;i&s;ter of the king of Bohemia. This alliance opened a commerce between the two nations; and many per&s;ons, during an interval of &s;everal years, pa&s;&s;ed over from Bohemia into England, on the account either of expectances, curio&s;ity, or bu&s;ine&s;s: &s;ome on the account of &s;tudy. With a view of
<PB N="155" REF="174">
this latter kind, a young Bohemian noble|man, who had fini&s;hed his &s;tudies in the univer&s;ity of Prague, &s;pent &s;ome time at Oxford. Here he became acquainted with the opinions of Wicliff, read his books, and admired both him and them. At his return to Prague he renewed an acquaintance, which grew into an entire familiarity, with John Hu&s;s; and put into his hands the writings of Wicliff, which he had brought over with him. They con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of tho&s;e warm pieces of that reformer, in which he inveighs again&s;t the corruptions of the clergy.</P>
<P>The&s;e writings &s;truck Hu&s;s with the force of revelation. He was a man of great &s;anctity of manners him&s;elf, and had the highe&s;t notions of the pa&s;toral care. With concern he had long &s;een, or thought he &s;aw, abu&s;es among the clergy of his time, which were truly deplorable. But his diffidence kept pace with his piety; and he could not per|&s;uade him&s;elf to <HI>ca&s;t the fir&s;t &s;tone.</HI> He now found that he had not been &s;ingular. He &s;aw the&s;e abu&s;es and corruptions dragged into open light; and it even mortified him to &s;ee that freedom in another, which he had
<PB N="156" REF="175">
been withheld, by a mere &s;cruple, from exerting him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As to the more alarming opinions of Wicliff, though it is probable Hu&s;s became at this time acquainted with &s;ome of them, yet it doth not <HI>appear</HI> they made any im|pre&s;&s;ion upon his mind; they were le&s;s ob|vious, and required more examination. From the language however, in which he always &s;poke of this reformer, we cannot imagine he had taken offence at any thing he had heard of him. He would call him an angel &s;ent from heaven to enlighten man|kind. He would mention among his friends his meeting with the works of Wicliff, as the mo&s;t fortunate circum&s;tance of his life; and would often &s;ay, he wi&s;hed for no better eternity, than to exi&s;t hereafter with that excellent man.</P>
<P>From this time, both in the &s;chools, and in the pulpit, as he had opportunity, he would inveigh, with great warmth, again&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical abu&s;es. He would point out the bad admini&s;tration of the church, and the bad lives of the clergy; and would patheti|cally lament the mi&s;erable &s;tate of the peo|ple,
<PB N="157" REF="176">
who were under the government of the one, and the influence of the other.</P>
<P>Indeed the &s;tate of the Bohemian clergy, as all their hi&s;torians te&s;tify, was at this time exceedingly corrupt. Religion was not only converted into a trade; but this trade was carried on with the utmo&s;t knavery, and ra|pacity. Avarice was their predominant vice. One of their bi&s;hops, we are told, was &s;o &s;ordidly addicted to it, that, being a&s;ked, What was the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable noi&s;e in na|ture? he an&s;wered, That of mouths feeding at his own table. Stories of this kind are unque&s;tionably exaggerated by the zeal of prote&s;tant writers. We may venture how|ever to make large deductions, and yet &s;till leave a very &s;ufficient charge again&s;t the morals of the Bohemian clergy.</P>
<P>It is no wonder therefore if Hu&s;s was heard with attention on &s;uch an argument. Indeed, all &s;ober and ingenuous men began to think favourably of him; and to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of expo&s;ing the clergy, were it only to open the eyes of the people, and pre|vent their being &s;educed by vile examples.</P>
<P>There were, at this time, in Prague, among the followers of Hu&s;s, two ingeni|ous
<PB N="158" REF="177">
foreigners; who, being unacquainted with the language of the country, invented a method of expo&s;ing the pride of the Romi&s;h clergy, which fully an&s;wered their end, and was well &s;uited to the &s;implicity of the times. They hung up, in the pub|lic hall of the univer&s;ity, two large pictures, in one of which were repre&s;ented Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, in that humility, and mode&s;ty of attire, with which they appeared upon earth; in the other, the pope and his car|dinals, in all that flow of garment, gold, and embroidery, in which their dignity &s;o much con&s;i&s;teth. The&s;e pictures, it is pro|bable, as pieces of art, were of no value; but the contra&s;t they exhibited was &s;o ex|ceedingly glaring, that among the common people they had more than the force of argument.</P>
<P>The &s;chi&s;m between the two popes, which hath already been mentioned, &s;till continued. This religious quarrel, having raged with &s;ufficient animo&s;ity during the reigns of the two pontiffs, who gave it birth, was be|queathed to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. It had now maintained it&s;elf above thirty years, and had
<PB N="159" REF="178">
been the common firebrand of Europe, through that whole tract of time.</P>
<P>The cardinals had made many attempts to put an end to this confu&s;ion; but without effect: the ambition of the reigning prelates interfered. To &s;trengthen their hands, the &s;acred college at length applyed to &s;ome of the leading princes of Europe. Henry IV. of England &s;eems to have intere&s;ted him&s;elf as much as any in this affair. He wrote with great &s;pirit to Gregory the XIIth; told him, that, at a moderate computation, 230,000 men had lo&s;t their lives in this quarrel; ex|po&s;tulated with him for upholding it; and advi&s;ed him to &s;ubmit to the deci&s;ion of the council, which was then a&s;&s;embling at Pi&s;a.</P>
<P>The intention of the council, it &s;eems, was to elect a new pope, and to make the two other popes give up their claims; which, at the time of their election, they had agreed in &s;uch circum&s;tances to do. Accordingly, in the year 1410 the cardinals of each party met at Pi&s;a, where a new election was made in favour of Alexander V. This pontiff, to &s;hew his gratitude to his good friend the king of England, granted his &s;ubjects a full re|mi&s;&s;ion of all manner of &s;ins, which was to
<PB N="160" REF="179">
be di&s;pen&s;ed on three &s;et days, at St. Bartho|lomew's in Smithfield. This was not done entirely gratis; but the indulgent pope had made the expence &s;o very ea&s;y, that, except indeed the mo&s;t indigent, all might enjoy the benefit of his ab&s;olution.</P>
<P>At the time of this pope's election, Hu&s;s, and his followers, began to make a noi&s;e in the world. They had now gotten &s;ome of the works of Wicliff tran&s;lated into the Sclavonian tongue; which were read with great attention in every part of Bohemia; and though it doth not appear, that any of the more offen&s;ive doctrines of that reformer had even yet obtained footing there; yet it is certain the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy had in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t that reverence, which had been hitherto paid them.</P>
<P>To check the growth of here&s;y, was the fir&s;t work in which Alexander engaged. He was &s;carce &s;eated in his chair, when he thun|dered out a very &s;evere bull, directed to the archbi&s;hop of Prague, and it is probable, di|rected by him likewi&s;e; in which he orders that prelate to make &s;trict enquiry after the followers of Wicliff; to apprehend, and
<PB N="161" REF="180">
impri&s;on them; and, if nece&s;&s;ary, to call in the &s;ecular arm.</P>
<P>Nor was private cau&s;e of pique wanting to engage the clergy in the &s;evere&s;t mea&s;ures. Be&s;ides the &s;pirited language, in which Hu&s;s had always treated them, he had, on the following occa&s;ion, made him&s;elf particularly obnoxious to the whole order.</P>
<P>Learning having been for many years very little the ta&s;te of the Bohemian gentry, the Germans, who in great numbers frequented the univer&s;ity of Prague, and enjoyed, by the &s;tatutes of the founder, a fourth part of the authority in it, had, by degrees, gotten po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole. This, when letters began to revive under the influence of Hu&s;s, became inconvenient. The Germans &s;tuck together; and a Bohemian, even in a uni|ver&s;ity of his own country, could meet with little encouragement in literary pur&s;uits. Hu&s;s &s;aw with regret the&s;e difficulties; and endeavoured with all his attention to remove them. Having put him&s;elf at the head of a con&s;iderable party, he made an application at court; and by his intere&s;t there, which with the queen e&s;pecially was very great, obtained a deci&s;ion, by which the authority
<PB N="162" REF="181">
of the&s;e &s;trangers was abridged, and the government of the univer&s;ity thrown into its natural channel. The Germans, piqued at this, left Prague in a body, (hi&s;torians rate the numbers of the&s;e di&s;contented &s;tudents at 3000) and &s;ettled them&s;elves in other hou&s;es of learning.</P>
<P>This temporary evil opened the mouths of Hu&s;s's enemies. The clergy in particular took the alarm; and immediately &s;hewed their di&s;gu&s;t at &s;eeing more weight thrown into a &s;cale, which they had ever been de|&s;irous of rendering as light as po&s;&s;ible. It is worth remarking, that this is the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the beginning of Wicliff's life.</NOTE> &s;econd in&s;tance, in the cour&s;e of a few pages, in which the herd of the Romi&s;h clergy have con&s;idered a &s;eat of learning as an intere&s;t oppo&s;ite to their own. Indeed in this ca&s;e, they had more to &s;ay. Hu&s;s, who was now &s;ole leader of the univer&s;ity, had long &s;hewn him&s;elf their avowed opponent; and if &s;in|gle, he had given them &s;o much cau&s;e of alarm, he became an object of double terror &s;upported by a multitude. They re&s;olved therefore to make a handle of the affair of
<PB N="163" REF="182">
the univer&s;ity; and though it was purely of a literary nature, it was plau&s;ibly converted into a bu&s;ine&s;s of religion.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who took offence at the&s;e proceedings, none took more than the arch|bi&s;hop of Prague. Having publi&s;hed the bull he had received from Rome, he &s;oon after publi&s;hed a re&s;cript of his own; which ordered all, who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any of the works of Wicliff, to bring them to him. Accordingly, many copies of different parts of his writings, (we are told above 200) were brought; which the archbi&s;hop im|mediately condemned to the flames. In this bu&s;ine&s;s, it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed, he acted at the &s;ame time a di&s;ingenuous, an illegal, and an unju&s;t part. In the fir&s;t place, thro' the ambiguity of the re&s;cript, it was ima|gined, he meant only to examine the books; to which the hone&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them had no objection; not doubting but &s;uch an ex|amination would redound to the honour of their ma&s;ter: Hu&s;s him&s;elf tells us, that he &s;ent in his books merely on this &s;uppo&s;ition.&mdash; Be&s;ides, they thought the primate had no authority for what he had done. They knew he had none from the pope; and if the
<PB N="164" REF="183">
action was his own, they could not but e&s;teem it as a very illegal &s;tretch of power.&mdash; And if it was illegal, as it appeared to be, they thought it farther a very con&s;iderable injury. For in tho&s;e days, before printing was invented, books had their value: and many of the&s;e likewi&s;e were ornamented with &s;ilver in a very expen&s;ive manner. It was an unlucky circum&s;tance too, in preju|dice to the archbi&s;hop, that he was a mo&s;t illiterate man: we are told he was &s;o to &s;uch a degree, that, by way of ridicule, he was commonly called <HI>alphabetarius,</HI> or the A, B, C doctor. As it was well known therefore he could not read the&s;e books him&s;elf, and as no examination of them had been heard of, what he had done &s;eemed rather an at|tack upon learning it&s;elf, than upon the doctrines of Wicliff.</P>
<P>This action of the archbi&s;hop gave great offence; and Hu&s;s remon&s;trated again&s;t it with as much warmth, as the candour and native mode&s;ty of his temper would admit. But notwith&s;tanding the propriety of his own behaviour, it is allowed, his followers acted with great indecency. Irritated by the lo&s;s of their books, they re&s;olved to retaliate a
<PB N="165" REF="184">
little of that &s;pirit, in which the injury had been done. Having procured a copy there|fore of the archbi&s;hop's re&s;cript, they burnt it with great pomp and ceremony in the public &s;treet.</P>
<P>Kindled at this treatment, the archbi&s;hop's zeal flamed out in all its violence; and eager to do more than he had the power to do him&s;elf, he hurried to the king, and laid his complaints at the foot of the throne.</P>
<P>Wince&s;laus, king of Bohemia, whom we &s;hall have frequent occa&s;ion to mention, was a prince, who looked for nothing in royalty, but the free indulgence of his pa&s;&s;ions. Matters of government were little his con|cern: and matters of religion &s;till le&s;s. He had been educated in the be&s;t &s;chool for im|provement, the &s;chool of affliction; yet he had profited little by the le&s;&s;ons he had there received. He had good natural parts, and great talents for bu&s;ine&s;s; but di&s;&s;imulation was the only talent which he employed. <HI>Temporibus in&s;idiari</HI> was his great maxim. If he had one fixed principle of government, it was never to encourage the zealots of any party. He cajoled the archbi&s;hop therefore with that art, which was natural to him;
<PB N="166" REF="185">
and endeavouring to convince him of the impropriety of his own interpo&s;ition, left him to manage the &s;ectaries, as he was able.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop was thoroughly mortified at the king's indifference for religion; and, as he found no redre&s;s from him, he deter|mined to try the force of his own authority. After mature deliberation, he prohibited Hu&s;s, by an interdict, from preaching in his chapel of Bethelem. Hu&s;s, as a member of the univer&s;ity, which held immediately of the Roman &s;ee, appealed to the pope.</P>
<P>Alexander V. was now dead; poi&s;oned, as was commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, by an ambitious cardinal, who found the means to &s;ucceed him. This was Baltha&s;ar Co&s;&s;a, who after|wards a&s;&s;umed the name of John XXIII. a man, who&s;e vicious life was probably the only foundation of the &s;u&s;picion. In his youth he had exerci&s;ed piracy: but finding this profe&s;&s;ion dangerous, he retired to Bo|lognia, where he applied him&s;elf to &s;tudy. His abilities, for he was ma&s;ter of many u&s;e|ful talents, &s;oon found a patron in Benedict IX; under whom he was initiated into all the my&s;teries of the conclave.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="186">John was pre&s;ently made acquainted with the &s;ituation of affairs in Bohemia. Hu&s;s had preached a &s;ermon at Prague, in which, it was thought, he had &s;poken lightly of oral tradition. This was immediately caught by the orthodox clergy; and carried, among other things, in the form of an accu&s;ation to Rome. The appeal therefore, and the ac|cu&s;ation accompanied each other.</P>
<P>John &s;eems to have had &s;omething el&s;e in his head at this time, be&s;ides religion. With|out examining the affair him&s;elf, he left it to his delegate, the cardinal de Columna; who appointed Hu&s;s a day for his appearance.</P>
<P>The report of this commi&s;&s;ion &s;pread a general alarm through Bohemia; where the whole party trembled for their chief. A powerful interce&s;&s;ion, headed by the queen her&s;elf, was made to the king, reque&s;ting his interpo&s;ition in the affair. Wince&s;laus com|plied; and di&s;patched amba&s;&s;adors to the pope, who in very pre&s;&s;ing terms reque&s;ted his holine&s;s to di&s;pen&s;e with Hu&s;s's per&s;onal appearance; alledging his innocence, and the dangers he would run in pa&s;&s;ing through Germany, where he had many enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="187">With the&s;e amba&s;&s;adors, Hu&s;s &s;ent his Proctors; who were treated with great &s;eve|rity, and in the end impri&s;oned. This was enough to give him a warning of his fate. The irritated pope excommunicated him, as it &s;eems, on the mere accu&s;ation of his enemies.</P>
<P>This treatment had no tendency to le&s;&s;en the popularity of Hu&s;s. His &s;ufferings in|deed gave him only the greater influence. The people con&s;idered him as &s;tanding &s;ingle in a common cau&s;e; as having paid their forfeiture as well as his own. Gratitude and compa&s;&s;ion therefore were added to their e&s;teem; and he never was &s;o much the idol of popular favour, as he was now. He had his adherents too among the higher ranks. The nobility were in general di&s;po&s;ed to &s;erve him; and he wanted not friends even among the clergy.</P>
<P>As he was thus &s;upported, we need not wonder that the di&s;grace he &s;uffered &s;at light upon him. We find him indeed no longer in the character of a public preacher; and &s;ome authors write that he retired from Prague. It is certain however, that, except preaching, he continued &s;till to di&s;charge
<PB N="169" REF="188">
every branch of the pa&s;toral care. One me|thod he u&s;ed was to give out que&s;tions, which he encouraged the people to di&s;cu&s;s in pri|vate, and to come to him with their difficul|ties. Many of the&s;e que&s;tions had a ten|dency to invalidate the pope's authority.</P>
<P>Every day made it now plainer, that the go&s;pellers, as the followers of Hu&s;s were, at this time, called, had &s;carce received any check. The primate was wretched to the la&s;t degree. The pope's authority had ap|peared to be of little weight; his own of le&s;s: the king was wholly indifferent: the em|peror alone remained, to whom application could be made. To him therefore he re|&s;olved to apply; but upon his journey he fell &s;ick, and died; fretted, as was commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, beyond &s;ufferance, at the perplex|ity of the affair.&mdash;The archbi&s;hop of Prague was a well intentioned, weak man; under the influence of violent pa&s;&s;ions: a mo&s;t unhappy compo&s;ition to be intru&s;ted with power.</P>
<P>The new archbi&s;hop, notwith&s;tanding his predece&s;&s;or had failed in his de&s;ign of cru&s;h|ing this ri&s;ing here&s;y, had the courage to make a farther attempt. He called a coun|cil
<PB N="170" REF="189">
of doctors; by whom, after much de|bating, &s;ome articles again&s;t Hu&s;s, and his adherents were drawn up, and publi&s;hed in form. They were intended to le&s;&s;en his cre|dit with the people; but they produced only a &s;pirited an&s;wer, in which Hu&s;s recapitulated what the late archbi&s;hop had done, and &s;hewed that he had never been able to prove any here&s;y again&s;t him: he concluded with begging, that he might be &s;uffered to meet, face to face, any one, who pretended to bring &s;uch a charge again&s;t him, and doubt|ed not but he &s;hould be able to purge him|&s;elf, to the &s;atisfaction of the whole king|dom of Bohemia.</P>
<P>Soon afterwards Hu&s;s publi&s;hed another piece again&s;t the u&s;urpations of the court of Rome. To this the archbi&s;hop and his council replied; but in a manner &s;o futile, that they did more injury to their cau&s;e, (e&s;pecially where prejudice ran high again&s;t them) than even their adver&s;aries them&s;elves had done. They applyed to the pope too for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but the pope &s;atisfied him&s;elf with exhorting the king to &s;uppre&s;s the pe&s;ti|lent doctrines of Wicliff; and, if po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="171" REF="190">
to curb the in&s;olence of Hu&s;s and his fol|lowers.</P>
<P>Indeed the pope had not lei&s;ure at this time to attend to controver&s;y. His ambition had incited him to quarrel with his neighbour the king of Naples, into who&s;e dominions he was meditating an irruption. But he fell into his own &s;nare. He declared him&s;elf before he was well prepared; and the wary Neapolitan taking the advantage of his igno|rance in matters of war, invaded the patri|mony, and dividing his forces, &s;at down be|fore &s;everal of the papal towns at once. In this perplexity John had recour&s;e to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed manner of levying troops. He di&s;|patched legates into various parts of Chri&s;ten|dom, who were largely commi&s;&s;ioned to grant pardons and indulgencies to all, who would inli&s;t under his banners.</P>
<P>Among other places, one of the&s;e recruit|ing officers came to Prague. Wince&s;laus had his rea&s;ons for favouring the pope; and fore&s;eeing that the legate would be oppo&s;ed by Hu&s;s and the go&s;pellers, forbad them by proclamation to interfere.</P>
<P>But the zeal of the&s;e &s;ectaries was of too high a temper to bear controul. They
<PB N="172" REF="191">
thought their con&s;ciences concerned; and would have looked upon them&s;elves as guilty, had they &s;tood aloof, and &s;een the people deluded. They took every opportunity there|fore of expo&s;ing the legate and his bu&s;ine&s;s; and of &s;hewing the folly of tru&s;ting to the pardon of a &s;inful man. Hu&s;s in particular exerted him&s;elf with great &s;pirit, and di&s;|per&s;ed among his friends many little tracts, which a&s;&s;i&s;ted them with proper arguments. His activity put an entire &s;top to the levy.</P>
<P>This behaviour was greatly re&s;ented by the king; and the magi&s;trates, who acted by his direction, ventured to &s;eize three of the mo&s;t zealous. The per&s;on of Hu&s;s was too &s;acred to be touched.</P>
<P>The impri&s;onment of the&s;e men threw the whole city into an uproar. The more for|ward of the go&s;pellers took arms, and &s;ur|rounded the town-hall, where the magi&s;trates were then &s;itting. With loud cries they de|manded to have their companions &s;et at li|berty. The magi&s;trates alarmed, came for|ward to the &s;tairs, &s;oothed them with gentle language, and promi&s;ed that their com|panions &s;hould be immediately relea&s;ed. The people went quietly home; and the un|fortunate
<PB N="173" REF="192">
pri&s;oners were in&s;tantly put to death.</P>
<P>Hu&s;s di&s;covered, on this occa&s;ion, a true Chri&s;tian &s;pirit. The late riot had given him great concern; and he had now &s;o much weight with the people, as to re&s;train them from attempting any farther violence; though &s;o notorious a breach of faith might almo&s;t have ju&s;tified any mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>This moderation was con&s;trued by the oppo&s;ite party into fear. The clergy, and magi&s;trates, who acted in concert, well knew on which &s;ide the balance of power lay: they knew that, even at the &s;ound of a bell, Hu&s;s could have been &s;urrounded by thou&s;ands of zealots, who might have laugh|ed at the police of the city. When they &s;aw them therefore, notwith&s;tanding this force, act in &s;o tame a manner, they ea&s;ily concluded they were under the influence of fear; &mdash; that the death of their friends had &s;truck a terror into them, &mdash; and that this was the time entirely to &s;ubdue them.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e mi&s;taken notions, the arch|bi&s;hop waited upon the king; a&s;&s;uring him, that if he cho&s;e to cru&s;h the go&s;pellers, and
<PB N="174" REF="193">
give peace to his kingdom, this was the time.</P>
<P>Wince&s;laus, whatever appearances he might think it prudent to a&s;&s;ume, was in his heart no friend to the novelties of the&s;e re|formers. He con&s;idered the go&s;pellers as a ne&s;t of hornets, which he dur&s;t not mole&s;t. While he &s;eemed to favour, he dete&s;ted them; and would have ventured a con&s;i|derable &s;take to have freed his kingdom from what he e&s;teemed &s;o great a nui&s;ance.</P>
<P>He heard the archbi&s;hop therefore with attention: He entered into his &s;cheme, and in <HI>his</HI> &s;pirit, but with &s;omewhat more of temper. He knew the inveteracy of the di&s;ea&s;e would admit of palliatives only: vio|lent medicines at lea&s;t he thought improper. He re&s;olved therefore to take &s;ome &s;tep, though not &s;o vigorous as that the clergy dictated. After much he&s;itation he at la&s;t bani&s;hed Hu&s;s from Prague. The late tu|mults were his pretence. This was the fir&s;t public in&s;tance he had given of his di&s;like to the go&s;pellers.</P>
<P>Hu&s;s immediately retired to his native place, where the principal per&s;on of the
<PB N="175" REF="194">
country being his friend, he lived unmo|le&s;ted; and was greatly re&s;orted to by all men of a &s;erious turn in tho&s;e parts; which contributed not a little to &s;pread his opinions, and e&s;tabli&s;h his &s;ect.</P>
<P>Some hi&s;torians give a different account of his leaving Prague; and make it a voluntary act. It is po&s;&s;ible there may be &s;ome truth in both the&s;e accounts. The king might expre&s;s his plea&s;ure, which Hu&s;s might willingly comply with.</P>
<P>During his retreat at Hu&s;&s;inez, he &s;pent much of his time in writing. Here he compo&s;ed his celebrated treati&s;e, <HI>Upon the church;</HI> out of which his adver&s;aries drew mo&s;t of tho&s;e objections, which were after|wards &s;o fatally brought again&s;t him at Con&s;tance.</P>
<P>From this place likewi&s;e he dated a paper, intitled, <HI>The &s;ix errors;</HI> which he fixed on the gate of the chapel of Bethelem. It was levelled again&s;t <HI>indulgencies;</HI> &mdash; again&s;t the abu&s;e of <HI>excommunication;</HI> &mdash; again&s;t <HI>believing</HI> in the pope; &mdash; again&s;t the unlimited <HI>obedience</HI> required by the &s;ee of Rome; &mdash; again&s;t <HI>&s;imony;</HI> with which he charged the whole
<PB N="176" REF="195">
church; and again&s;t <HI>making</HI> the body o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Chri&s;t in the ma&s;s.</P>
<P>This paper was greedily received in Bohe|mia; and increa&s;ed that odium which had been rai&s;ed again&s;t the clergy. Many anec|dotes al&s;o again&s;t the dignified eccle&s;ia&s;tics had found their way among the people; by whom they were dre&s;&s;ed out in the mo&s;t unfavourable colours. So many open mouths, and &s;uch an abundance of matter to fill them, rendered the clergy, in a &s;hort time &s;o infa|mous, that few of them dur&s;t appear in public.</P>
<P>The politic king &s;aw an advantage. Pa|pi&s;t and go&s;peller were alike to him: he had already made an engine of one party; and he now &s;aw a favourable opportunity of working with the other. In &s;hort, he thought he had the means before him of re|pleni&s;hing his coffers.</P>
<P>He told the clergy, <Q>He was &s;orry to hear &s;uch complaints again&s;t them;&mdash;that he was determined to put a &s;top to the&s;e enormities; &mdash; that Bohemia would be the &s;candal of Chri&s;tendom; &mdash; that he had already done ju&s;tice upon the &s;ectaries; &mdash;
<PB N="177" REF="196">
and that an <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> &s;hould be no &s;e|curity to <HI>them.</HI></Q> His language was ea&s;ily under&s;tood; and large commutations were offered, and accepted.</P>
<P>One thing is too remarkable to e&s;cape no|tice. <Q>That tythes were mere temporal endowments, and might be re&s;umed by the temporal lord, when the prie&s;t was unde&s;erving,</Q> was that doctrine of Wicliff, which gave mo&s;t offence in England; and, as it &s;eems, in Bohemia likewi&s;e. It was con&s;idered by the churchmen of both king|doms as an here&s;y of the mo&s;t pe&s;tilent kind. On this occa&s;ion however, the king in&s;i&s;ting upon it, the Bohemian clergy were glad to redeem their tythes by owning the doctrine orthodox.&mdash;Thus the king played one party again&s;t the other; and left neither any cau&s;e to triumph. No man under&s;tood better the balance of parties, nor the advantages, which might accrue from adju&s;ting it properly.</P>
<P>About the time of this conte&s;t with the clergy, we find Hu&s;s again in Prague, though it does not appear, whether the king per|mitted, or connived at him.</P>
<P>Alexander V. the predece&s;&s;or of John XXIII. had been cho&s;en pope, we have &s;een,
<PB N="178" REF="197">
to put an end to the &s;chi&s;m, which raged in the Roman church; on which event it had been expected the other two popes would relinqui&s;h their claims. So they had pro|mi&s;ed at their election. But re&s;tle&s;s am|bition intervened. Neither of them would give up his power; and from that time the church was governed (if &s;uch anarchy can be called government) by three popes at once. Their names were now John, Gre|gory, and Benedict.</P>
<P>With a view to clo&s;e this fatal &s;chi&s;m; to remove &s;uch di&s;orders in the church, as had &s;prung up during the continuance of it; and to bring about a thorough reformation of the clergy, the emperor Sigi&s;mond, in the year 1414, convened a general council.</P>
<P>Sigi&s;mond, the brother of Wince&s;laus, was the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed prince of the age in which he lived. To the virtues of a patriot he added a greatne&s;s of mind, and dignity of manner, which adorned a throne. It might perhaps be &s;aid, that he excelled too in the princely art of di&s;&s;imulation: that indeed was the great foible in his character. He was him&s;elf a man of letters; and glo|ried in being thought the patron of learning.
<PB N="179" REF="198">
He had enobled, on the occa&s;ion of &s;ome &s;olemnity, a learned doctor, who had &s;poken an eloquent oration. In the proce&s;&s;ion, which followed, the doctor cho&s;e rather to walk among the nobility, than among his learned brethren. <Q>Sir, (&s;aid the emperor ob&s;erving it,) dimini&s;h not a body, which it is not in my power to repleni&s;h: the corps you have joined I can augment when I plea&s;e.</Q> This prince was more &s;ucce&s;s|ful in his negotiations than in his wars; and yet he was e&s;teemed a better &s;oldier, than a &s;tate&s;man. In his cabinet he often blun|dered; but rarely in his camp. His political errors were yet generally retrieved by a noble air of ingenuity, and an addre&s;s which no|thing could with&s;tand. His manners were the mo&s;t humane and gentle. He would often &s;ay, <Q>When I forgive an injury, I ac|quire a friend.</Q> But what is very &s;ur|pri&s;ing in a character of this liberal ca&s;t, he was a bigot.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the rea&s;ons already mentioned for calling a general council at this time, Sigi&s;|mond had other motives. The Ottoman arms having lately given a &s;evere blow to the empire, and growing daily more formidable,
<PB N="180" REF="199">
he was very &s;ollicitous to oppo&s;e them; and he could not &s;o effectually do it, while Eu|rope continued in a divided &s;tate. This fa|mous council was convened at Con&s;tance, one of the mo&s;t &s;outhern towns in Germany, &s;ituate on the confines of Switzerland, as nearly as might be, in the middle of Chri&s;t|endom. Hither from all parts of Europe princes and prelates, clergy and laity, regu|lars and &s;eculars, flocked together. Mr. Fox hath given us an humourous catalogue of them. <Q>There were, (&s;ays he) archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops 346, abbots and doctors 564, princes, dukes, earls, knights and &s;quires 16000, common-women 450, barbers 600, mu&s;icians, cooks and je&s;ters 320.</Q>&mdash;Four pre&s;idents were cho&s;en from four nations, Germany, France, England and Italy,</P>
<P>Ceremonies and punctilios being &s;ettled, the con&s;ultation opened. That a reformation of the clergy was nece&s;&s;ary, was agreed on all hands; but a debate aro&s;e, in what part of the clerical &s;cale it &s;hould begin? While &s;ome contended it &s;hould begin a minoritis, at the inferior clergy, the emperor replied bri&s;kly, "Non a minoritis, &s;ed a majoritis." They began therefore with pope John. This
<PB N="181" REF="200">
unhappy pontiff, being convicted of many crimes, was deprived, and impri&s;oned. Gregory was prudent enough to give in a re&s;ignation; and e&s;caped on ea&s;ier terms. But Benedict continued long ob&s;tinate. The king of Navarre e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e for &s;ome time; but that prince for&s;aking him, he was deprived and excommunicated. In the room of the&s;e three Martin was cho&s;en. &mdash; Thus at length was clo&s;ed the great &s;chi&s;m of the Roman church; and here too ended the reformation of the clergy; a work be|gun indeed with &s;pirit; but unhappily left unfini&s;hed. &mdash; But this is anticipating the affairs of the council; for the depo&s;ition of the three popes was in fact conducted lei|&s;urely with the other bu&s;ine&s;s of it.</P>
<P>The next grand de&s;ign of the fathers in this council was to apply remedies to the di&s;|orders of the church. By the di&s;orders of the church nothing more was meant than Wicliff's here&s;y; the extirpation of which took up a full moiety of the council's time. Wicliff was now dead: their rage therefore again&s;t him wanted its full &s;cope. What was in their power however they did: they re|viled his memory: they condemned his te|nets:
<PB N="182" REF="201">
they burnt his books: nay they order|ed his very bones to be dug out of the grave, and con&s;umed to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>Their rage however, unavailing again&s;t him, fell with double weight upon his fol|lowers. Of the&s;e Hu&s;s was the principal. Some time before the council was opened, application had been made to the emperor to bring him to Con&s;tance. The emperor en|gaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ent two gentle|men into Bohemia to communicate the affair to Hu&s;s him&s;elf. Hu&s;s directly an&s;wered, "That he de&s;ired nothing more than to purge him&s;elf publicly of the imputation of here&s;y; and that he e&s;teemed him&s;elf happy in &s;o fair an opportunity of doing it, as the approaching council afforded."</P>
<P>Before he began his journey, he thought it proper to give notice, (which he did by putting up papers in the mo&s;t public parts of Prague) that he was going to Con&s;tance; and that whoever had objections again&s;t him or his doctrine, might make them there. He provided him&s;elf likewi&s;e with proper te&s;ti|monials; and what is very remarkable, he obtained one from the bi&s;hop of Nazareth, inqui&s;itor general of here&s;y in Bohemia;
<PB N="183" REF="202">
which is &s;till extant. In this the bi&s;hop de|clares, that as far as he had any opportunity to know, (and he had had many opportuni|ties) Hu&s;s had never &s;hewn the lea&s;t inclina|tion to impugn any article of the Chri&s;tian faith. He provided him&s;elf likewi&s;e with a pa&s;&s;port from the emperor.</P>
<P>In october 1414, he &s;et out for Con&s;tance, accompanied by two Bohemian noblemen, the barons of Clum, and Latzenbock; who were among the mo&s;t eminent of his di&s;ci|ples, and followed their ma&s;ter merely thro' re&s;pect and love. Some writers &s;ay, they were required by the emperor to attend him.</P>
<P>Through whatever towns of any con&s;e|quence he pa&s;&s;ed, he had the following paper po&s;ted up: <Q>John Hu&s;s, B. D. is now upon his journey to Con&s;tance, there to defend his faith; which by God's help he will defend unto death. Willing therefore to &s;atisfy every man, who hath ought to ob|ject again&s;t him, he publi&s;hed in Bohemia, and now doth publi&s;h in this noble and imperial city his &s;aid intention. Whoever therefore hath any error or here&s;y to lay to the charge of the &s;aid John Hu&s;s, be it known unto him, that the &s;aid John is
<PB N="184" REF="203">
ready to an&s;wer the &s;ame at the approach|ing council.</Q></P>
<P>The civilities, and even reverence, which he met with every where, exceeded his ima|gination. The &s;treets, and &s;ometimes the very roads were lined with people, whom re&s;pect, rather than curio&s;ity drew together. He was u&s;hered into towns with acclama|tions; and indeed pa&s;&s;ed through Germany in a kind of triumph. He could not help expre&s;&s;ing his &s;urprize at the reception he met with. <Q>I thought, (&s;aid he,) I had been an outca&s;t; I now &s;ee my wor&s;t ene|mies are in Bohemia.</Q> At Nuremburgh he was received with particular di&s;tinction; the magi&s;trates and clergy waited upon him in form; and being convinced of his inno|cence and integrity, a&s;&s;ured him they had no doubt but the council would di&s;mi&s;s him with honour.&mdash;The&s;e in&s;tances of the re&s;pect he met with are worth mentioning, not only as they &s;hew the veneration in which Hu&s;s was generally held; but as they &s;hew like|wi&s;e how well-di&s;po&s;ed the Germans were, even at that early day, to a reformation. This &s;cene was acted about an hundred years before the time of Luther.&mdash;In three weeks
<PB N="185" REF="204">
Hu&s;s arrived at Con&s;tance; where, no one mole&s;ting him, he took private lodgings. One of his hi&s;torians tells us, with an air of triumph, that his ho&s;te&s;s's name was <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after Hu&s;s left Prague, Stephen Paletz left it likewi&s;e; a per&s;on employed by the clergy there to manage the intended pro&s;ecution again&s;t him at Con&s;tance. Paletz was a man of good parts, plau&s;ible morals, and more learning than was commonly found among the churchmen of tho&s;e days. He had contracted an early intimacy with Hu&s;s: their &s;tudies had been nearly the &s;ame: their opinions &s;eldom oppo&s;ite. When John XXIII. &s;ent his legate to Prague, to levy forces again&s;t the king of Naples, his bulls were con&s;idered as a party-te&s;t in Bohemia;&mdash; a kind of &s;hiboleth, which di&s;tingui&s;hed the papi&s;t from the go&s;peller. Paletz having re|ceived favours from the pope, and expecting more, deliberated what he &s;hould do. In a que&s;tion of <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong,</HI> he &s;hould have taken the <HI>fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion,</HI> which is ge|nerally that of <HI>con&s;cience:</HI> in a cool delibe|ration intere&s;t is apt to interfere. He was guilty therefore of a common piece of &s;elf-deceit; and mi&s;took a point of con&s;cience
<PB N="186" REF="205">
for a matter of prudence. His deliberations therefore ended as &s;uch deliberations gene|rally do: he made a matter of prudence of it. Having thus pa&s;&s;ed the barrier, every thing el&s;e was ea&s;y. The &s;ame prudence &s;ugge&s;ted to him, that what he had already done was in&s;ufficient;&mdash;that his offence in having at all communicated with the enemies of religion was great;&mdash;and that his atone|ment mu&s;t be great likewi&s;e. He made his atonement, and with abundant zeal; and continued from that time the mo&s;t forward of Hu&s;s's per&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame errand came to Con&s;tance, on the part of the court of Rome, Michael de Ca&s;&s;is; a per&s;on of a le&s;s &s;olemn appear|ance, but of more dextrous talents. He had been bred a churchman, and was bene|ficed in Bohemia, which was his native country. But his abilities had been gro&s;ly mi&s;taken. Formed by nature for bu&s;ine&s;s, he had an utter aver&s;ion to &s;tudy, and the confined employment of a parochial cure. He was a &s;ubtle enterpri&s;ing man, ver&s;ed in the world, of courtly manners, and a mo&s;t in&s;inuating addre&s;s. Finding his profe&s;&s;ion a curb upon his genius, he recommended
<PB N="187" REF="206">
him&s;elf to his &s;overeign under the title of a projector. The king of Bohemia had a gold mine in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; which had been long neglected, as having co&s;t more than its pro|duce. This mine de Ca&s;&s;is pretended to work at an ea&s;ier expence; and dre&s;&s;ed his tale in &s;o many plau&s;ible circum&s;tances, that Wince&s;laus was thoroughly impo&s;ed upon; and intru&s;ted him with what money he de|&s;ired, to the amount of a large &s;um, for the execution of his project. Whether the arti&s;t at fir&s;t meant hone&s;tly, may be doubted; his project however mi&s;carried: on which find|ing him&s;elf in a perplexity, he embezzled what was left of the money, and e&s;caped out of Bohemia. Rome was the a&s;ylum he cho&s;e. Here by an artful di&s;play of &s;ome new talents, of which he had a great variety, he obtained not only the pope's protection, but his favour; and became a very u&s;eful per&s;on in the capacity of one, who was ready for any employment, which nobody el&s;e would undertake. When it was re&s;olved in the conclave to have Hu&s;s brought before the council of Con&s;tance, this man was tamper'd with. He made large promi&s;es: "He had formerly been acquainted with
<PB N="188" REF="207">
Hu&s;s at Prague, and knew &s;uch things of him, as perhaps nobody el&s;e did." In &s;hort, being thought an excellent in&s;trument for the purpo&s;e, and being well pen&s;ioned, and in&s;tructed, he &s;et out among the pope's retinue.</P>
<P>When Hu&s;s arrived at Con&s;tance, he found the council almo&s;t full: the more con&s;iderable members of it were either al|ready arrived, or arriving every day: the pope had been there &s;ome days; and held his re&s;idence in a ca&s;tle near the city.</P>
<P>Immediately after Hu&s;s's arrival, his friend the baron de Clum notified it to the pope; whom he informed at the &s;ame time, that Hu&s;s had obtained the emperor's &s;afe con|duct, to which he begged his holine&s;s would add his own. <Q>If he had killed my bro|ther, (an&s;wered John vehemently,) he &s;hould have it.</Q></P>
<P>Hu&s;s depending upon his innocence, and &s;till more upon the emperor's honour, u&s;ed the &s;ame freedom of &s;peech at Con&s;tance, which he had ever u&s;ed at Prague. He &s;up|po&s;ed he &s;hould have been called upon to preach before the council; and had provided two &s;ermons for that purpo&s;e; in one of
<PB N="189" REF="208">
which he made a confe&s;&s;ion of his faith; and in the other &s;hewed the nece&s;&s;ity of a reformation of the clergy. But the council did not put him upon preaching; which &s;hews, as Leufant &s;eems to in&s;inuate, that they were predetermined to de&s;troy him. They were unwilling to give him an oppor|tunity of &s;peaking, without interruption, to the people; knowing that his noble &s;impli|city, his doctrine far from heretical, and the engaging &s;weetne&s;s of his manner, would have greatly conciliated the minds of men in his favour.</P>
<P>In the mean time his adver&s;aries, particu|larly the two already mentioned, were inde|fatigable. They were continually with the leading members of the council, plotting, contriving, and concerting in what way their &s;chemes might run the lea&s;t ri&s;k of a mi&s;|carriage. Paletz took upon him&s;elf the ta&s;k of drawing up articles, which he did with &s;uch acrimony, as left no room for the amendment of others.&mdash;The effect of the&s;e &s;ecret negotiations &s;oon appeared.</P>
<P>About the beginning of december, the bi&s;hops of Au&s;burgh and Trent came to Hu&s;s's lodgings, informing him they were
<PB N="190" REF="209">
&s;ent by the pope and the college of cardinals, who were now di&s;po&s;ed to hear what he had to urge in his defence. Hu&s;s excu&s;ed his attendance. "I came voluntarily hither, &s;aid he, to be examined before the whole council; and to them only I will render my&s;elf accountable." The bi&s;hops a&s;&s;uming a friendly air, began to pre&s;s him: and after many a&s;&s;urances, on their part, of the pu|rity of their intentions, and &s;ome farther oppo&s;ition on his, he at length complied.</P>
<P>His examination before the pope and car|dinals was a mere farce. They wanted him in their power; and even &s;till &s;eemed irre|&s;olute how to act. Paletz pre&s;&s;ed to have him impri&s;oned; and a&s;&s;ured the cardinals, he was daily increa&s;ing his party by that un|bridled liberty of &s;peech, in which he was indulged.</P>
<P>While this point was debating, Hu&s;s was engaged in the following &s;cene. As he waited in a gallery, a Franci&s;can came up to him; and, after many cro&s;&s;ings, and ge&s;ticulations common among that &s;ort of men, acco&s;ted him thus. "Reverend fa|ther, of whom the world &s;peaketh &s;o loudly, excu&s;e a poor friar's impertinence. All my
<PB N="191" REF="210">
life long have I been enquiring after truth. Many difficulties have ari&s;en in the cour&s;e of my enquiries: &s;ome I have conquered; others have been above my abilities. Among the re&s;t, none hath occa&s;ioned me &s;o much per|plexity, as the doctrine of the &s;acrament. How kindly &s;hould I take it, would you rectify my errors. I am informed, you hold, that the bread &s;till remains material, after the words of the con&s;ecration?" Hu&s;s told him, he had been mi&s;informed. Upon which the Franci&s;can &s;eeming &s;urprized, re|peated his que&s;tion, and received the &s;ame an&s;wer. A&s;king the &s;ame que&s;tion a third time, the baron de Clum, who attended Hu&s;s, turned to the friar, and &s;aid with &s;ome a&s;perity, "Why, do&s;t thou believe this re|verend father would lie to thee? How many an&s;wers do&s;t thou expect?" "Gentle &s;ir, (&s;aid the Franci&s;can,) be not wroth with your poor &s;ervant.&mdash;I a&s;ked but in mere &s;impli|city, and through a de&s;ire of knowledge.&mdash; May I then, (&s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Hu&s;s) pre&s;ume to a&s;k, what kind of union of the godhead and manhood &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the per&s;on of Chri&s;t?" Hu&s;s &s;urprized at this que&s;tion, &s;aid to the baron in the Sclavonian
<PB N="192" REF="211">
tongue, "This is one of the mo&s;t difficult que&s;tions in divinity:" And then turning to the Franci&s;can, told him, he did not be|lieve him to be that uninformed per&s;on whom he pretended to be. The Franci&s;can finding him&s;elf &s;u&s;pected, went off with the &s;ame &s;anctified grimaces, with which he had approached; and the baron a&s;king a &s;oldier of the pope's guard, who &s;tood near him, if he knew the Franci&s;can, the &s;oldier told him, that his name was Didace; and that he was e&s;teemed the mo&s;t &s;ubtil divine in Lombardy. It afterwards appeared, that the whole was a formed &s;cheme of the car|dinals, who had &s;ent this per&s;on to endeavour to draw &s;ome new matter of accu&s;ation again&s;t Hu&s;s from his own mouth. The &s;tory may give an idea of the unmanly artifices which were practi&s;ed again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The friar was &s;carce gone, when an offi|cer appeared with a party of guards; and &s;eizing Hu&s;s, &s;hewed his warrant to appre|hend him. A&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch perfidy, the baron ran in&s;tantly to the pope, and de|manded an audience, or rather indeed pu&s;h|ed rudely into his pre&s;ence; where with great heat of language, (for he was naturally a
<PB N="193" REF="212">
warm man) he remon&s;trated again&s;t &s;o no|torious a breach of faith. "Can your holi|ne&s;s, (&s;aid he) deny, that with your own mouth, you made me a formal promi&s;e, that Hu&s;s &s;hould remain unmole&s;ted at Con|&s;tance?" The pope was confounded: he &s;at &s;peechle&s;s for &s;ome time; at la&s;t, he brought out by &s;yllables, &mdash; that it was the act of the cardinals; &mdash; that he had no hand in the matter; &mdash; that he could not help it.</P>
<P>In truth, the pope was an object of pity as well as blame. Fore&s;eeing the &s;torm, which was already gathering again&s;t him, he was looking round for &s;helter; and was be|come at this time &s;o di&s;pirited, &s;o timid, &s;o fearful of giving offence, among the cardi|nals particularly, from whom he had &s;o much both to hope and fear, that he neither did, nor &s;aid any thing but what he knew would be agreeable. The baron perceiving the pope would not interfere, left him with indignation, re&s;olving to try his influence with the other members of the council.</P>
<P>In the mean time Hu&s;s was conveyed pri|vately to Con&s;tance, where he was confined in the chapter-hou&s;e of the cathedral, till a more proper place could be found.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="213">Upon the banks of the Rhine, where that river leaves the lake of Con&s;tance, &s;tood a lonely mona&s;tery, belonging to the Fran|ci&s;cans, the whole intere&s;t of which order was bent again&s;t Hu&s;s. Thither he was conveyed, and lodged in a noi&s;ome dun|geon.</P>
<P>Yet even here his active &s;pirit could not re&s;t unemployed. By the help of a &s;ingle ray of light, which &s;hone through an aper|ture in his cavern, he compo&s;ed many little tracts; which afterwards found their way into Bohemia, and were in great e&s;teem among his followers. Of the&s;e one was a comment upon the commandments; a &s;econd upon the Lord's prayer: a third was an e&s;&s;ay upon the knowledge and love of God; and a fourth upon the three great enemies of mankind. Be&s;ides the&s;e, were &s;ome others.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Hu&s;s was thus employed, the baron, and many of his other friends, were labouring for his liberty. They applied &s;e|parately to the leading members of the council; and addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves particu|larly to the four pre&s;idents. All was in vain: effectual pains had been taken to fru&s;trate their endeavours; every ear was
<PB N="195" REF="214">
&s;topped, and every avenue barred. Baffled, and di&s;concerted, the baron was obliged to de&s;i&s;t, full of reflections upon the horrors of eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e endeavours for the recovery of his liberty, Hu&s;s was &s;eized with a violent di&s;order, probably brought on by unwhol&s;ome air, and want of exerci&s;e. His di&s;ea&s;e increa&s;ing, his life was in que&s;tion. The pope alarmed, &s;ent his own phy&s;icians to attend him. A grand council was called. "What &s;hould be done? Should the heretic dye, him&s;elf and his doctrine yet uncon|demned, what di&s;credit would ari&s;e to the church of Chri&s;t?" They re&s;olved there|fore to draw up articles again&s;t him, and condemn him in pri&s;on. Articles accord|ingly were drawn up, and a formal citation &s;ent.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;engers found him extended upon what &s;erved him for a bed. He rai&s;ed him|&s;elf upon his arm. His eyes &s;unk and lan|guid, his vi&s;age pale, and emaciated. "You &s;ee, (&s;aid he) friends, my condition. Do I &s;eem like a man fit to defend a cau&s;e in a public a&s;&s;embly? &mdash; Go &mdash; tell your ma&s;ters what you have &s;een.&mdash; But &s;tay; tell
<PB N="196" REF="215">
them likewi&s;e, that if they will only allow me an advocate, I will not fail, even in this condition, to join i&s;&s;ue with them."</P>
<P>This reque&s;t occa&s;ioned a new debate. All were again&s;t clo&s;ing with it; but they wanted a pretext. Fortunately an old canon was produced, which forbad any one to de|fend the cau&s;e of an heretic. Though this was begging the que&s;tion; yet it was the faire&s;t pretence which could be found. Hu&s;s was accordingly informed, that his reque&s;t &s;hould have been complied with, but the orders of holy church forbad. &mdash; While this affair was in agitation, the following event checked its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>John XXIII. from many &s;ymptoms at this time, fore&s;eeing his fate, re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to avoid it. He left Con&s;tance therefore in di&s;gui&s;e, and made towards Italy; flattering him&s;elf, that if he &s;hould be able to reach Rome, he might &s;till contrive to baffle the council. But his hopes were too &s;anguine. The emperor, having early notice of his flight, with a &s;peedy arm arre&s;ted him near the alps. He was brought back to Con&s;tance; and from that time every appearance of power fell from him.&mdash;This event put a &s;top to the
<PB N="197" REF="216">
pro&s;ecution again&s;t Hu&s;s; and his health afterwards growing better, it was for &s;ome time wholly laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>The Bohemian nobility having in vain made an application to the council, applied next to the emperor. That prince, when fir&s;t informed of the impri&s;onment of Hu&s;s, was greatly di&s;gu&s;ted at it. So notorious a breach of faith &s;hocked the hone&s;ty of his nature; and he &s;ent immediate orders to Con&s;tance, where he him&s;elf was not yet arrived, to have him in&s;tantly relea&s;ed. But the fathers of the council &s;oon removed his &s;cruples; and he was, at the time of the pope's flight, &s;o entirely devoted to their &s;entiments, that he delivered Hu&s;s into their hands. By them that unfortunate man was &s;ent to the ca&s;tle of Gotleben, beyond the Rhine, where he was laden with fetters, and at night even chained to the floor:&mdash;to &s;uch a determined height was the malice of his enemies at this time rai&s;ed!</P>
<P>Nor was Hu&s;s the &s;ingle object of their re&s;entment. Whoever in Con&s;tance was known to be of his party became immedi|ately obnoxious. The populace were even mad with the prejudices of their leaders;
<PB N="198" REF="217">
had thoroughly imbibed their &s;pirit, and turned it into fury: &s;o that it became dan|gerous not only for Hu&s;s's followers, but even for his favourers to appear in public. Seeing their pre&s;ence therefore &s;erved only to exa&s;perate, the greater part of them with|drew from Con&s;tance, leaving their unfor|tunate leader to abide his fate.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his friends in Bohemia were &s;ufficiently active. The whole king|dom was in motion. Me&s;&s;engers were con|tinually po&s;ting from one province to ano|ther. It appeared as if &s;ome great revolu|tion was approaching. At length a petition was &s;ent through the kingdom, and &s;ub|&s;cribed by almo&s;t the whole body of the Bohemian nobility, and gentry. It was dated in May 1415, and was addre&s;&s;ed to the council of Con&s;tance. In this petition, having put the council in mind of the &s;afe conduct, which had been granted to Hu&s;s; and of their having, in an unprecedented manner, impri&s;oned him, before they had heard his defence; they begged a &s;peedy end might be put to his &s;ufferings, by allowing him an audience as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. The barons, who pre&s;ented this petition, were
<PB N="199" REF="218">
an&s;wered in brief, that no injury had been done to their countryman; and that he &s;hould very &s;peedily be examined.</P>
<P>Finding however that delays were &s;till made, they pre&s;ented a &s;econd, and more explicit petition to the pre&s;idents of the four nations: and not receiving an immediate an&s;wer, they pre&s;ented a third, in which they begged the relea&s;e of Hu&s;s in very pre&s;&s;ing terms, and offered any &s;ecurity for his appearance.</P>
<P>The Bohemian nobility were too much in earne&s;t, and too in&s;tant to be wholly ne|glected. As carele&s;s an ear as po&s;&s;ible had been thus far lent to their petitions. But their ardour was now too great to be ea&s;ily checked. The patriarch of Antioch there|fore, in an&s;wer to this la&s;t petition, made them a hand&s;ome &s;peech; and in civil lan|guage informed them, that no &s;ecurity could be taken; but that Hu&s;s &s;hould certainly be brought to a hearing in le&s;s than a week.</P>
<P>When they pre&s;ented this la&s;t petition to the council, they pre&s;ented another to the emperor; in which they pre&s;&s;ed upon him, with great earne&s;tne&s;s, his honour &s;olemnly engaged for the &s;ecurity of Hu&s;s; and im|plored

his protection, and his intere&s;t with the council.</P>
<P>As the affair of the &s;afe conduct, in which the aggravation of the injuries done to Hu&s;s &s;o greatly depends, is placed in different lights by prote&s;tant and popi&s;h writers, it may not be improper to enquire into the merits of it; and to lay before the reader the principal topics of the argument on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the prote&s;tants exclamations again&s;t &s;o notorious a breach of faith, the papi&s;t thus apologizes.</P>
<P><Q>We allow, (&s;ays Mainburgh,) that Hu&s;s obtained a &s;afe conduct from the emperor: but for what end did he obtain it? Why, to defend his doctrine. If his doctrine was indefen&s;ible, his pa&s;s was invalid. It was always, (&s;ays Ro&s;weide, a je&s;uit,) <HI>&s;up|po&s;ed,</HI> in the &s;afe conduct, that ju&s;tice &s;hould have its cour&s;e. &mdash; Be&s;ides, (cry a number of apologizers) the emperor plainly exceeded his powers. By the canon-law he could not grant a pa&s;s to an heretic; and by the decretals the council might annul any imperial act. &mdash; Nay far|ther, (&s;ays Morery,) if we examine the
<PB N="201" REF="220">
pa&s;s, we &s;hall find it, at be&s;t, a promi&s;e of &s;ecurity only till his arrival at Con&s;tance; or indeed rather a mere recommendation of him to the cities, through which he pa&s;&s;ed: &s;o that, in fact, it was righteou&s;ly fulfilled.</Q></P>
<P>To all this the prote&s;tant thus replies. <Q>Be it granted, (which is, in truth, grant|ing too much,) that the &s;afe conduct im|plied a liberty only of defending his doc|trine; yet it was violated, we find, before that liberty was given, &mdash; before that doc|trine was condemned, or even examined.&mdash; And though the emperor might exceed his power in granting a pa&s;s to an heretic, yet Hu&s;s was, at this time, only <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> of here&s;y. Nor was the imperial act an|nulled by the council, till after the pa&s;s was violated. Hu&s;s was condemned in the fifteenth &s;e&s;&s;ion, and the &s;afe-conduct decreed invalid in the nineteenth.&mdash;With regard to the deficiency of the &s;afe-con|duct, which is Morery's apology, it doth not appear, that it was ever an apology of ancient date. Hu&s;s, it is certain, con&s;i|dered the &s;afe-conduct as a &s;ufficient &s;ecu|rity for his return home: and indeed &s;o
<PB N="202" REF="221">
much is implied in the very nature of a &s;afe-conduct. What title would that ge|neral de&s;erve, who &s;hould invite his ene|my into his quarters by a pa&s;s, and then &s;eize him? Rea&s;oning however apart, let us call in fact. <HI>Omni pror&s;us impedi|mento remoto, tran&s;ire, &s;tare, morari, &amp;</HI> REDIRE, <HI>liber&egrave; permittatis &s;ibique et &s;uis,</HI> are the very words of the &s;afe-conduct.</Q></P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion therefore we cannot but judge the emperor to have been guilty of a mo&s;t notorious breach of faith. The blame however is generally laid, and with &s;ome rea&s;on, upon the council, who directed his con&s;cience. What true &s;on of the church would dare to oppo&s;e his private opinion again&s;t the unanimous voice of a general council?</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of June, the council had pro|mi&s;ed the Bohemian deputies, that Hu&s;s &s;hould be examined within the week. They &s;aid <HI>examined;</HI> but they meant <HI>condemned.</HI> In the mean time, as if they had been &s;u&s;|picious of their cau&s;e, all probable means were u&s;ed to &s;hake his re&s;olution, and make him retract: but his unaltered firmne&s;s gave them no hope of effecting their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="222">On the 5th of June it was re&s;olved, that the articles objected to him, &s;hould be pro|duced, and in his ab&s;ence examined: when, after what they called a <HI>fair hearing,</HI> he &s;hould be &s;ent for, and condemned.</P>
<P>There was attending the council, at that time, a public notary, who&s;e name was Madonwitz. This man, whether &s;truck with the iniquity of their proceedings, or in his heart a favourer of Hu&s;s, went im|mediately to the Bohemian deputies; and gave them a full information of the de&s;igns of the council. The deputies had no time to lo&s;e. They demanded an in&s;tant audience of the emperor; and laid their complaints before him.</P>
<P>Sigi&s;mond was at lea&s;t a decent adver&s;ary. The manners of a court had poli&s;hed away tho&s;e rough edges of bigotry in him, which appeared &s;o har&s;h in the cloy&s;tered church-man. He was greatly offended at the gro&s;s proceedings of the council; and &s;ent them a very arbitrary me&s;&s;age to de&s;i&s;t. He would have nothing done, he told them, but with the defendant face to face. This me&s;&s;age had its effect; and Hu&s;s was &s;ummoned to appear before them the next day.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="223">The a&s;&s;embly was held in a large cloy&s;ter belonging to the Franci&s;cans. Here a new &s;cene, and of a very extraordinary kind, was pre&s;ented. The fir&s;t article of the charge was &s;carce read, and a few witne&s;&s;es in a cur&s;ory manner examined, when, Hu&s;s preparing to make his defence, the tumult began. Loud voices were heard from every quarter; a multitude of que&s;tions at the &s;ame in&s;tant a&s;ked, every one &s;peaking, and no one heard, or heard but in one univer&s;al din of confu&s;ion. From many parts even re|proaches, and the mo&s;t opprobrious language broke out. &mdash; Such, on this occa&s;ion, was the behaviour of the famous council of Con&s;tance. No forum could produce more licentious in&s;tances of popular tumult. If an interval of le&s;s di&s;order &s;ucceeded, and Hu&s;s was about to offer any thing in his de|fence, he was immediately interrupted: <Q>What avails this? What is that to the purpo&s;e?</Q> No appearance of argument was brought again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Such a&s;toni&s;hing licence moved, in &s;ome degree, the mo&s;t di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate of men. "In this place, (&s;aid Hu&s;s,) looking round him, I hoped to have found a different treatment."
<PB N="205" REF="224">
His rebuke increa&s;ed the clamour; &s;o that finding it vain to attempt any farther defence, he held his peace. This was matter of new triumph: "He was now confounded, &s;ilenced, by confe&s;&s;ion guilty." Luther hath given us a &s;trong picture of this unruly a&s;&s;embly. <HI>"Ibi omnes,</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>aprorum more, fremere, &s;etas &agrave; tergo erigere, frontem corrugare, dente&s;que acuere caeperunt."</HI></P>
<P>There were &s;ome in that council, men of cooler temper, who fore&s;eeing the ill effects of &s;uch violence, u&s;ed what credit they had to check it. To divert the furious &s;pirit, which had &s;pread among tho&s;e zealots, and to throw in &s;o much moderation among them, as to bring them to debate calmly, was at this time impo&s;&s;ible. All that could be done, was, to get the bu&s;ine&s;s po&s;tponed till another opportunity: which was at length, and with the utmo&s;t difficulty, effected.</P>
<P>The next morning they met again. They were hardly &s;eated, when the emperor en|tered the council-chamber, and took his &s;eat at the upper end of it. The di&s;order of the a&s;&s;embly, the day before, had greatly di&s;|gu&s;ted Sigi&s;mond; and he came now pre|pared
<PB N="206" REF="225">
to awe them into a more decent be|haviour. His end was in part obtained. Mere decency was at lea&s;t ob&s;erved. &mdash; It would be tedious to enter into a full detail of what pa&s;&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion: what fol|lows is a &s;ummary of it.</P>
<P>The examination was opened by Du Ca&s;&s;is; the fir&s;t article of which exhibited a charge again&s;t Hu&s;s for denying the real pre|&s;ence. This was proved by a Dominican, from a &s;ermon which Hu&s;s had preached at Bethelem. He had only to an&s;wer, that he had always held the true catholic doctrine; which was a known truth among his friends; for he had ever believed tran&s;ub&s;tantiation.</P>
<P>He was next charged in general with maintaining the pernicious errors of Wicliff. To this he an&s;wered, that he never had held any error, which he knew to be &s;uch; and that he de&s;ired nothing more than to be con|vinced of what errors he might inadvertently have fallen into.&mdash;Wicliff's doctrine of tythes was objected to him; which, he owned, he knew not how to refute. &mdash; It was farther proved, that he had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf again&s;t burning the books of Wicliff. To this he an&s;wered, that he had &s;poken again&s;t burn|ing
<PB N="207" REF="226">
them in the manner practi&s;ed by the late archbi&s;hop of Prague, who condemned them to the flames without examining them. &mdash; He was farther charged with &s;aying, that he wi&s;hed his &s;oul in the &s;ame place, where Wicliff's was. This expre&s;&s;ion, he owned, he had made u&s;e of; which afforded matter of great mirth to his hearers.</P>
<P>The next article charged him with &s;edi|tion, in exciting the people to take arms again&s;t their &s;overeign. But of this charge he entirely exculpated him&s;elf. Nothing indeed could be proved again&s;t him, but that in a &s;ermon, by no means temporizing, he had exhorted his hearers, in the apo&s;tle's language, <HI>to put on the whole armour of God.</HI> This very frivolous charge gives us the mo&s;t adequate idea of the malice of his enemies.</P>
<P>The next article accu&s;ed him of forming di&s;&s;entions between the church and the &s;tate; and of ruining the univer&s;ity of Prague. The former part of the accu&s;ation alluded to a di&s;pute between the pope and the king of Bohemia, which Hu&s;s was &s;aid, though un|ju&s;tly, to have fomented: the latter part to the affair of the Germans, which hath al|ready been placed in its proper light. &mdash; An
<PB N="208" REF="227">
examination of Hu&s;s on the&s;e few articles employed the fir&s;t day.</P>
<P>The council ri&s;ing, he was carried back to pri&s;on. As he pa&s;&s;ed by the cardinal of Cambray, who &s;at near the emperor, the cardinal &s;topping him, &s;aid, "I have been informed, you have heretofore boa&s;ted, that unle&s;s you had cho&s;en it your&s;elf, neither the king of Bohemia, nor the emperor could have forced you to Con&s;tance." "My lord cardinal, (an&s;wered Hu&s;s,) if I &s;aid any thing of this kind, I &s;aid it not in the &s;trong terms, in which it hath been repre&s;ented to you. I might po&s;&s;ibly &s;peak gratefully of the kind|ne&s;s of my friends in Bohemia." Upon this the baron de Clum, who never left him, with a noble firmne&s;s, told the cardinal, that if what he had heard had been &s;aid, it was only the truth. "I am far from being, (&s;aid he,) a per&s;on of the greate&s;t con&s;equence in my own country: others have &s;tronger ca&s;tles, and more power than I have; yet even I would have ventured to have defend|ed this reverend father a whole year again&s;t the utmo&s;t efforts of both the princes you have mentioned."</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="228">The emperor then turning to Hu&s;s, told him, that he had given him his &s;afe-conduct, which he found was more than was well in his power, that he might have an opportu|nity to vindicate his character: "But depend upon it, (&s;aid he) if you continue ob&s;tinate, I will make a fire with my own hands, to burn you, rather than you &s;hall e&s;cape."</P>
<P>To this zealous &s;peech Hu&s;s an&s;wered, in few words, that he could not charge him&s;elf with holding any opinions ob&s;tinately; &mdash; that he came thither with joy rather than reluctance; that if any better doctrine than his own could be laid before him in that learned a&s;&s;embly, he might &s;ee his error, and embrace the truth. &mdash; Having &s;aid this, he was carried back to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>His examination did not end here. He was called before the council again; and many articles, not fewer than 40, were brought again&s;t him. The chief of them were extracted from his books; and &s;ome of them by very unfair deduction.</P>
<P>The following opinions, among many others, which gave offence, were e&s;teemed mo&s;t criminal. &mdash;"That there was no ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity for a vi&s;ible head of the church&mdash;
<PB N="210" REF="229">
that the church was better governed in apo&s;|tolic times without one &mdash; that the title of holine&s;s was improperly given to man&mdash;that a wicked pope could not po&s;&s;ibly be the vicar of Chri&s;t, and he denied the very authority on which he pretended to act &mdash; that liberty of con&s;cience was every ones natural right&mdash; that eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures, e&s;pecially &s;uch as touched the life of man, had no foundation in &s;cripture &mdash; that eccle&s;ia&s;tical obedience &s;hould have its limits&mdash;that no excommuni|cation &s;hould deter the prie&s;t from his duty&mdash; that preaching was as much required from the mini&s;ter of religion, as alms-giving from the man of ability; and that neither of them could hide his talent in the earth without in|curring the divine di&s;plea&s;ure."&mdash;Paletz and the cardinal of Cambray were the chief ma|nagers of this examination.</P>
<P>To the&s;e opinions, mo&s;t of which were proved and acknowledged, he added many things in the cour&s;e of his examination, which were eagerly laid hold on; particularly again&s;t the &s;candalous lives of the clergy of every denomination; the open &s;ymony practi&s;ed among them, their luxury, lewdne&s;s, and ignorance.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="230">Hu&s;s having now been examined on all tho&s;e articles, which the nice&s;t &s;crutiny into his books, and the mo&s;t exact remembrance of his words, could furni&s;h, the cardinal of Cambray thus acco&s;ted him. <Q>Your guilt hath now been laid before this augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly with its full force of evidence. I am obliged therefore to take upon me the di&s;agreeable ta&s;k of informing you, that only this alternative is offered to you: either to abjure the&s;e damnable errors, and &s;ubmit your&s;elf to the council; in which ca&s;e the&s;e reverend fathers will deal as gently with you as po&s;&s;ible: or to abide the &s;evere con&s;equence of an ob&s;tinate adherence to them.</Q> To which Hu&s;s an&s;wered, that he had nothing to &s;ay, but what he had often &s;aid before; that he came there not to defend any opinion ob&s;tinately; but with an earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee his errors, and amend them; &mdash; that many opinions had been laid to his charge, &s;ome of which he had never maintained, and others, which he had maintained, were not yet confuted;&mdash; that as in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, he thought it ab&s;urd to abjure opinions which were never his; &s;o
<PB N="212" REF="231">
in the &s;econd, he was determined to &s;ub&s;cribe nothing again&s;t his con&s;cience."</P>
<P>The emperor told him, he &s;aw no diffi|culty in his renouncing errors, which he had never held. "For my&s;elf, &s;aid he, I am, at this moment, ready to renounce every here&s;y, that hath exi&s;ted in the Chri&s;tian church: does it therefore follow that I have been an heretic?"</P>
<P>Hu&s;s re&s;pectfully made a di&s;tinction be|tween abjuring errors in general; and abjuring errors which had been fal&s;ely imputed: the latter he could not abjure; but he prayed the council to hear him upon the&s;e points, which to them appeared erroneous; were it only to convince them that he had &s;omething to &s;ay for the opinions he maintained. To this reque&s;t however the council paid no atten|tion.</P>
<P>Here Paletz and De Ca&s;&s;is took an oppor|tunity to exculpate them&s;elves of any appear|ance of malice in this di&s;agreeable pro&s;ecu|tion. They both had entered upon the ta&s;k with great unwillingne&s;s; and had done no|thing but what their duty required. To which the cardinal of Cambray added, that he could &s;ufficiently exculpate them on that
<PB N="213" REF="232">
head. They had behaved; he &s;aid, through the whole of this tedious bu&s;ine&s;s, with great humanity; and to his knowledge might have acted a much &s;everer part.</P>
<P>The emperor ob&s;erving, that every thing, which the cau&s;e would bear, had now been offered, aro&s;e from his &s;eat, and thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the council.</P>
<P><Q>You have now heard, reverend fathers, an ample detail of here&s;ies, not only proved, but confe&s;&s;ed; each of which unque&s;tion|ably, in my judgment, de&s;erveth death. If therefore the heretic continueth ob&s;tinate in the maintenance of his opinions, he mu&s;t certainly die. And if he &s;hould even abjure them, I &s;hould by no means think it proper to &s;end him again into Bohemia; where new opportunities would give him new &s;pirits, and rai&s;e a &s;econd commotion wor&s;e than the fir&s;t.&mdash;As to the fate how|ever of this unhappy man, be that as it may hereafter be determined; at pre&s;ent, let me only add, that an authentic copy of the condemned articles &s;hould be &s;ent into Bohemia, as a ground-work for the clergy there to proceed on; that here&s;y may at
<PB N="214" REF="233">
length be rooted up, and peace re&s;tored to that di&s;tracted country.</Q></P>
<P>The emperor having fini&s;hed his &s;peech, it was agreed in the council to allow Hu&s;s a month longer to give in his final an&s;wer. With the utmo&s;t difficulty he had &s;upported him&s;elf through this &s;evere trial. Be&s;ides the malice of his enemies, he had upon him the paroxi&s;m of a very violent di&s;order. On this la&s;t day he was &s;carce able to walk, when he was led from the council. His con&s;olation in the&s;e circum&s;tances was a cold and hungry dungeon, into which he was inhumanly thru&s;t.</P>
<P>His friend, the baron, attended him even hither, and with every in&s;tance of endearing tenderne&s;s, endeavoured to &s;upport him. The &s;uffering martyr wrung his hand; and looking round the horrid &s;cene, earne&s;tly cried out, <Q>Good God! this is friend&s;hip indeed!</Q> His keepers &s;oon after put him in irons; and none, but &s;uch as were licenced by the council, were allowed to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>The generous nature of Sigi&s;mond, tho' he was not unver&s;ed in the artifices of the cabinet, abhorred a practi&s;ed fraud. The affair of Hu&s;s, amid&s;t all the ca&s;ui&s;try of the
<PB N="215" REF="234">
council, gave him keen di&s;tre&s;s; and he wi&s;hed for nothing more ardently, than to rid his hands of it with honour.&mdash;On the other &s;ide, his vanity and his intere&s;t engaged him to appear the defender of the catholic cau&s;e in Germany. If he &s;uffered Hu&s;s to be put to death, one part of the world would que&s;tion his honour; if he interfered with a high hand in pre&s;erving him, the other part would que&s;tion his religion. The perplexity was great; from which he thought nothing could relieve him, but the recantation of Hu&s;s.</P>
<P>To obtain this, he tried every mean in his power, he had already endeavoured to inti|midate him with high language, which he had u&s;ed, both in the council, and in other places. But this was ineffectual. He had now recour&s;e to &s;oothing arts. The form of a recantation was offered; in which Hu&s;s was required only to renounce tho&s;e here&s;ies, which had been fairly proved. But that undaunted man &s;till continued inflexible. Several deputations were afterwards &s;ent to him in pri&s;on; and bi&s;hops, cardinals, and princes in vain tried their eloquence to per|&s;uade him.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="235">Sigi&s;mond &s;eeing the conclu&s;ion to which this fatal affair was approaching, might pro|bably have intere&s;ted him&s;elf thus far, as thinking he had been too conde&s;cending to the council. The flame too, which he &s;aw kindling in Bohemia, where he had high expectations, and was willing to pre&s;erve an intere&s;t, might alarm him greatly. He had gone too far however to recede; and knew not how to take Hu&s;s out of the hands of the council; into which he had given him with &s;o much zeal and devotion.</P>
<P>In the mean time Hu&s;s remained ma&s;ter of his &s;ate; and &s;hewed a con&s;tancy which &s;carce any age hath excelled. He amu&s;ed him&s;elf, while it was permitted, with writing letters to his friends, which were privately conveyed by the Bohemian lords, who vi&s;it|ed him in pri&s;on. Many of the&s;e letters are &s;till extant. The following may be a te&s;t of that compo&s;ed piety and rational frame of mind, which &s;upported him in all his &s;uffer|ings.</P>
<P>"My dear friends, let me take this la&s;t opportunity of exhorting you to tru&s;t in nothing here, but to give your&s;elves up en|tirely to the &s;ervice of God. Well am I
<PB N="217" REF="236">
authorized to warn you not to tru&s;t in princes, nor in any child of man, for there is no help in them. God only remaineth &s;tedfa&s;t. What <HI>he</HI> promi&s;eth, he will undoubtedly perform. For my&s;elf, on his gracious pro|mi&s;e I re&s;t. Having endeavoured to be his faithful &s;ervant, I fear not being de&s;erted by him. Where I am, &s;ays the gracious pro|mi&s;er, there &s;hall my &s;ervant be. May the God of heaven pre&s;erve you!&mdash;This is pro|bably the la&s;t letter I &s;hall be enabled to write. I have rea&s;on to believe I &s;hall be called upon to morrow to an&s;wer with my life. &mdash; Sigi&s;mond hath in all things acted deceitfully.&mdash;I pray God forgive him! You have heard in what &s;evere language he hath &s;poken of me."</P>
<P>The month, which had been allowed by the council, being now expired, a deputation of four bi&s;hops came to receive his la&s;t an|&s;wer, which was given in the &s;ame language as before.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth of July was appointed for his condemnation; the &s;cene of which was opened with extraordinary pomp. In the morning of that day, the bi&s;hops and tem|poral lords of the council, each in his robes,
<PB N="218" REF="237">
a&s;&s;embled in the great church at Con&s;tance The emperor pre&s;ided in a chair of &s;tate When all were &s;eated, Hu&s;s was brought in by a guard. In the middle of the church, a &s;caffold had been erected; near which a table was placed, covered with the ve&s;tments of a Romi&s;h prie&s;t.</P>
<P>After a &s;ermon, in which the preacher earne&s;tly exhorted his hearers to <HI>cut off the man of &s;in,</HI> the proceedings began. The articles alledged again&s;t him were read aloud; as well tho&s;e, which he had, as tho&s;e which he had not allowed. This treatment Hu&s;s oppo&s;ed greatly; and would gladly, for his character's &s;ake, have made a di&s;tinction: but finding all endeavours of this kind in|effectual, and being indeed plainly told by the cardinal of Cambray, that no farther op|portunity of an&s;wering for him&s;elf &s;hould be allowed, he de&s;i&s;ted; and falling on his knees, in a pathetic ejaculation, commend|ed his cau&s;e to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The articles again&s;t him, as form required, having been recited, the &s;entence of his con|demnation was read. The in&s;trument is tedious: in &s;ub&s;tance it runs, "That John Hu&s;s, being a di&s;ciple of Wicliff of damna|ble
<PB N="219" REF="238">
memory, who&s;e life he had defended, and who&s;e doctrines he had maintained, is adjudged by the council of Con&s;tance (his tenets having been fir&s;t condemned) to be an ob&s;tinate heretic; and as &s;uch, to be de|graded from the office of a prie&s;t; and cut off from the holy church."</P>
<P>His &s;entence having been thus pronounced, he was ordered to put on the prie&s;t's ve&s;t|ments, and a&s;cend the &s;caffold, according to form, where he might &s;peak to the peo|ple; and, it was hoped, might &s;till have the grace to retract his errors. But Hu&s;s con|tented him&s;elf with &s;aying once more, that he knew of no errors, which he had to re|tract; that none had been proved upon him; and that he would not injure the doctrine he had taught, nor the con&s;ciences of tho&s;e who had heard him, by a&s;cribing to him|&s;elf errors, of which he had never been convinced.</P>
<P>When he came down from the &s;caffold, he was received by &s;even bi&s;hops, who were commi&s;&s;ioned to degrade him. The cere|monies of this bu&s;ine&s;s exhibited a very un|chri&s;tian &s;cene. The bi&s;hops forming a cir|cle round him, each adding a cur&s;e took off
<PB N="220" REF="239">
a part of his attire. When they had thus &s;tripped him of his &s;acerdotal ve&s;tments, they proceeded to era&s;e his ton&s;ure, which they did by clipping it into the form of a cro&s;s. Some writers &s;ay, that in doing this, they even tore and mangled his head; but &s;uch &s;tories are unque&s;tionably the exagge|ration of zeal. The la&s;t act of their zeal was to adorn him with a large paper cap; on which, various, and horrid forms of devils were painted. This cap one of the bi&s;hops put upon his head; with this unchri&s;tian &s;peech, <Q>Hereby we commit thy &s;oul to the devil.</Q> Hu&s;s &s;miling, ob&s;erved, <Q>It was le&s;s painful than a crown of thorns.</Q></P>
<P>The ceremony of his degradation being thus over, the bi&s;hops pre&s;ented him to the emperor. They had now done, they told him, all the church allowed. What re|mained was of civil authority. Sigi&s;mond ordered the duke of Bavaria to receive him, who immediately gave him into the hands of an officer. This per&s;on had orders to &s;ee him burned, with every thing he had about him.</P>
<P>At the gate of the church a guard of 800 men waited to conduct him to the place of
<PB N="221" REF="240">
execution. He was carried fir&s;t to the gate of the epi&s;copal palace; where a pile of wood being kindled, his books were burned before his face. Hu&s;s &s;miled at the indignity.</P>
<P>When he came to the &s;take, he was allowed &s;ome time for devotion; which he performed in &s;o animated a manner, that many of the &s;pectators, who came there &s;ufficiently prejudiced again&s;t him, cried out, <Q>What this man hath &s;aid within doors we know not, but &s;urely he prayeth like a Chri&s;tian.</Q></P>
<P>As he was preparing for the &s;take, he was a&s;ked whether he cho&s;e a confe&s;&s;or? He an&s;wered in the affirmative; and a prie&s;t was called. The de&s;ign was to draw from him a retractation, without which, the prie&s;t &s;aid, he dur&s;t not confe&s;s him. "If that be your re&s;olution, &s;aid Hu&s;s, I mu&s;t die without confe&s;&s;ion: I tru&s;t in God, I have no mor|tal &s;in to an&s;wer for."</P>
<P>He was then tied to the &s;take with wet cords, and fa&s;tened by a chain round his body. As the executioners were begining to pile the faggots around him, a voice from the crowd was heard, <Q>Turn him from the ea&s;t; turn him from the ea&s;t.</Q> It &s;eemed
<PB N="222" REF="241">
like a voice from heaven. They who con|ducted the execution, &s;truck at once with the impropriety, or rather prophanene&s;s o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> what they had done, gave immediate order<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to have him turned due we&s;t.</P>
<P>Before fire was brought, the duke of Bavaria rode up, and exhorted him once more to retract his errors. But he &s;till con|tinued firm. "I have no errors, &s;aid he, to retract: I endeavoured to preach Chri&s;t with apo&s;tolic plainne&s;s; and I am now pre|pared to &s;eal my doctrine with my blood."</P>
<P>The faggots being lighted, he recom|mended him&s;elf into the hands of God, and began a hymn, which he continued &s;inging, till the wind drove the flame and &s;moke into his face. For &s;ome time he was invi&s;ible. When the rage of the fire abated, his body half con&s;umed appeared hanging over the chain; which, together with the po&s;t, were thrown down, and a new pile heaped over them. The malice of his ene|mies pur&s;ued his very remains. His a&s;hes were gathered up, and &s;cattered in the Rhine; that the very earth might not feel the load of &s;uch enormous guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="242">From this view of the life and &s;ufferings of Hu&s;s, it is hard to &s;ay what were the real grounds of the animo&s;ity he had rai&s;ed. His creed unque&s;tionably was far from being exactly orthodox; yet it is plain how very ill able his adver&s;aries were to gather from it offen&s;ive matter enough for an accu&s;ation. He believed tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; he allowed the adoration of &s;aints; he practi&s;ed con|fe&s;&s;ion; he &s;poke cautiou&s;ly of tradition, and reverently of the &s;even &s;acraments; and whatever latitude he might give him&s;elf on any of the&s;e articles, it was not more than had been often taken, inoffen&s;ively taken, by Ger&s;on, Zabarelle, and other &s;pirited divines of the Roman church.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the great pains the council took to avoid a public que&s;tion, and the great confidence with which Hu&s;s de&s;ired one, are pre&s;umptions very &s;trong in his favour.</P>
<P>It is the opinion of Lenfant, that the great cau&s;e of his condemnation was his in|troducing Wicliff's doctrine into Bohemia; and chiefly perhaps that offen&s;ive part of it, which &s;truck at the temporalities of the clergy. And indeed this is extremely pro|bable from the whole conduct of the coun|cil;
<PB N="224" REF="243">
for though it is apparent, that he never adopted the entire &s;y&s;tem of that reformer; yet his principles, it is certain, would have led him much farther, than they had hitherto done: and the fathers of the council being aware of this, &s;eem to have determined, though at the expence of ju&s;tice, to cru&s;h an evil in its origin, which appeared teeming with &s;o much mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, there &s;eems to have been another cau&s;e for that unabated prejudice, which ran &s;o high again&s;t him. The warmth, with which he treated the corruptions of the clergy, and the u&s;urpations of the church of Rome, was a crime never to be forgiven by the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of tho&s;e times; and added the keene&s;t edge to their re&s;entment. &mdash; But as this was an unpopular cau&s;e to appear in, it is plain they wanted to have it believed their re&s;entment aro&s;e upon another account. This &s;eems to have been the foundation of a &s;peech, attributed by Varillas to cardinal Perron; "My learned friends, (he would &s;ay,) you cannot employ your time wor&s;e, than in giving the world any account of the affairs of Hu&s;s."</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="244">His LIFE however was the &s;evere&s;t &s;atyr upon the clergy. It was a mirror, which reflected their di&s;torted features. In him they &s;aw the true eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and the real chri&s;tian,&mdash;characters &s;o different from their own. Gentle and conde&s;cending to the &s;en|timents of others, this amiable pattern of virtue was &s;trict only in his own principles. The opinions indeed of men were le&s;s his concern than their practice. His great con|te&s;t was with vice; and he treated the mini|&s;ters of religion with freedom, only as he thought their example encouraged, rather than checked, that licence, which prevailed. The great lines in his character were piety, and fortitude. His piety was calm, rational, and manly: his fortitude nothing human could daunt. The former was free from the lea&s;t tincture of enthu&s;ia&s;m; the latter from the lea&s;t degree of weakne&s;s. He was in every re&s;pect an apo&s;tolical man. "From his infancy, (&s;ays the univer&s;ity of Prague, in a voluntary te&s;timonial,) he was of &s;uch excellent morals, that during his &s;tay here, we may venture to challenge any one to pro|duce a &s;ingle fault again&s;t him."</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="245">As to his parts and acquirements, he &s;eems to have been above mediocrity; and yet not in the highe&s;t form, in re&s;pect of either. A vein of good &s;en&s;e runs through all his writings; but their di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tics are &s;implicity and piety. In one of Luther's pieces we have the follow|ing te&s;timony in their favour. "In a mo|na&s;tic library, (&s;ays that reformer,) a volume of Hu&s;s's writings fell in my way; which I &s;eized with great eagerne&s;s, &s;urprized that &s;uch a book had e&s;caped the flames, and de|&s;irous to know &s;omething of the opinions of that here&s;iarch. But who can expre&s;s my a&s;toni&s;hment, when I found him by many degrees the mo&s;t rational expounder of &s;crip|ture I had ever met with. I could not help crying out, What could occa&s;ion the &s;everity with which this man was treated! yet as the name of Hu&s;s was &s;o dete&s;table; and as a favourable opinion of him was &s;o ut|terly incon&s;i&s;tent with a Chri&s;tian's faith, I &s;hut the book, and could find comfort only in this thought, that perhaps he wrote the&s;e things before his fall; for I was yet ignorant of what had pa&s;&s;ed at the council of Con|&s;tance."</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="246">To pre&s;erve the memory of this excellent man, the 6th of July was, for many years, held &s;acred among the Bohemians. A &s;er|vice, adapted to the day, was appointed to be read in all churches; and in&s;tead of a &s;ermon, an oration was &s;poken in commen|dation of their martyr, in which the noble &s;tand he made again&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny was commemorated; and his example pro|po&s;ed as a pattern to all Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>In &s;ome places large fires were lighted in the evening, upon the mountains, to pre&s;erve the memory of his &s;ufferings; round which the country-people would a&s;&s;emble, and &s;ing hymns in his prai&s;e.</P>
<P>A very remarkable medal was &s;truck in honour of him, on which was repre&s;ented his effigies, with this in&s;cription, CENTUM REVOLUTIS ANNIS DEO RESPONDEBITIS ET MIHI. The&s;e words are &s;aid to have been &s;poken by him to his adver&s;aries, a little be|fore his execution; and were afterwards applied, by the zealots of his &s;ect, as pro|phetic of Luther; who lived about an hun|dred years after him. The &s;tory carries with it an air of irrational zeal; and &s;eems calculated only for the credulous.</P>

<HEAD><PB N="229" REF="248">The life of JEROME of PRAGUE.</HEAD>
<P>WE find very little relating to the early part of the life of this reformer. As he was a zealous follower of Hu&s;s, and united with him in all his &s;chemes; the actions, in which they were jointly engaged, are a&s;cribed by hi&s;torians to Hu&s;s, as the more eminent leader. In general however, we find his youth &s;pent in an eager pur&s;uit of knowledge; which he &s;ought after in all the more con&s;iderable univer&s;ities of Europe; particularly in tho&s;e of Prague, Paris, Hei|delburgh, Cologn, and Oxford.</P>
<P>At Oxford, which &s;eems to have been the la&s;t &s;eat of learning, which he vi&s;ited, he became acquainted with the works of Wicliff; and being a per&s;on of uncommon application, he tran&s;lated many of them into his native language; having with great pains made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="249">It is probable he had conceived an e&s;teem for Wicliff, before he went to Oxford. At his return to Prague, he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf an open favourer of him; and finding his doctrines had made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in Bohemia, and that Hu&s;s was at the head of that party, which had e&s;pou&s;ed them, he attached him&s;elf to that leader.</P>
<P>Hu&s;s was glad of &s;o able an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in his great work of reforming the clergy: for Jerome was inferior to none of his time, in point either of abilities, or learning;&mdash;&s;upe|rior certainly to his ma&s;ter in both. Hu&s;s was however better qualified as the leader of a party; his gentlene&s;s, and very per&s;ua&s;ive manner conciliating the minds of men in his favour: whereas Jerome, with all his great and good qualities, wanted temper.</P>
<P>Of this we have &s;ome in&s;tances; one in|deed very flagrant. He was di&s;puting with two monks about reliques, whom he acci|dentally met on the banks of the Muldaw; and finding him&s;elf more warmly oppo&s;ed than he expected, he &s;eized one of them by the middle, and threw him into the river. The monk recovered the &s;hore; but was in no condition to pur&s;ue his argument. So
<PB N="231" REF="250">
Jerome triumphed by the &s;trength of his arm. Whether this &s;tory be a fact, as in|deed Lenfant &s;peaks very dubiou&s;ly of the truth of it, we have however no rea&s;on to doubt, that Jerome was principally concern|ed in tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate doings, which have been mentioned in the life of Hu&s;s.</P>
<P>We find little more recorded of Jerome, till the time of the council of Con&s;tance. When Hu&s;s went thither, Jerome, we are told, very pathetically exhorted him to bear up firmly in this great trial; and in parti|cular to in&s;i&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly upon the corrupt &s;tate of the clergy; and the nece&s;&s;ity of a reformation. He added, that if he &s;hould hear in Bohemia, that Hu&s;s was overpower|ed by his adver&s;aries, he would immediately repair to Con&s;tance; and lend him what a&s;&s;i&s;tance he was able.</P>
<P>He promi&s;ed only what he fully intended. He no &s;ooner heard of the difficulties, in which his ma&s;ter was engaged, than he &s;et out for Con&s;tance; notwith&s;tanding Hu&s;s wrote very pre&s;&s;ing letters, in&s;i&s;ting upon his putting off the de&s;ign, as dangerous, and unprofitable.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="251">He arrived at Con&s;tance, on the 4th of April, 1415; about three months before the death of Hu&s;s. He entered the town pri|vately; and con&s;ulting with &s;ome of the leaders of his party; whom he found there, he was ea&s;ily convinced, that he could be of no &s;ervice to his friend: he found the coun|cil would not &s;o much as give him an hear|ing; and that open violence was the only argument they u&s;ed. He heard likewi&s;e, that his arrival at Con&s;tance had taken air; and that the council intended to &s;eize him.</P>
<P>As this was the &s;ituation of things, he thought it prudent to retire. Accordingly the next day he went to Iberling, an impe|rial town about a mile from Con&s;tance; whither he fled, &s;ays Reichenthal, with &s;uch precipitation, that he left his &s;word behind him. Reichenthal was an officer, em|ployed by the council, to give an account of all &s;trangers, who came to Con&s;tance.</P>
<P>From Iberling Jerome wrote to the em|peror, and profe&s;&s;ed his readine&s;s to appear before the council, if that prince would give him a &s;afe-conduct. But Sigi&s;mond had the hone&s;ty to refu&s;e. Jerome then
<PB N="233" REF="252">
tried the council; but could not obtain a favourable an&s;wer.</P>
<P>In this perplexity he put up papers in all the public places of Con&s;tance, particularly upon the doors of the cardinals hou&s;es, in which he profe&s;&s;ed his readine&s;s to appear at Con&s;tance, in the defence of his character, and doctrine, both which he heard had been exceedingly defamed; and declared, that if any error &s;hould be proved again&s;t him, he would with great readine&s;s retract it; begg|ing only that the faith of the council might be given for his &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The&s;e papers obtaining no an&s;wer, he &s;et out upon his return to Bohemia. He had the precaution to carry with him a certificate &s;igned by &s;everal of the Bohemian nobility then at Con&s;tance, te&s;tifying, that he had u&s;ed all prudent means in his power to ob|tain a hearing.</P>
<P>But he did not thus e&s;cape. At Hir&s;aw he was &s;eized by an officer of the duke of Sultzbach; who, though he acted un|authorized, made little doubt of the coun|cil's thanks for &s;o acceptable a &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Reichanthal hath given us a more parti|cular account of this matter. "At a village
<PB N="234" REF="253">
upon the borders of the black fore&s;t, (&s;aith that &s;trenuous defender of the council,) Jerome fell accidentally in company with &s;ome prie&s;ts. The conver&s;ation turning upon the council of Con&s;tance, Jerome grew warm; and among other &s;evere things, called that a&s;&s;embly the <HI>&s;chool of the devil,</HI> and <HI>a &s;ynagogue of iniquity.</HI> The prie&s;ts, &s;candal|ized at this language, gave immediate in|formation of it to the chief magi&s;trates of the place, who arre&s;ted Jerome, and put him into the hands of the duke of Sultz|bach.&mdash;This &s;tory hath by no means an im|probable air; as it is rather characteri&s;tic; though Lenfant treats it as a fable.</P>
<P>The duke of Sultzbach, having gotten Jerome in his power, wrote to the council for directions. The council, expre&s;&s;ing their obligations to the duke, de&s;ired him to &s;end his pri&s;oner immediately to Con|&s;tance. The elector-palatine met him, and conducted him in triumph into the town; him&s;elf riding on hor&s;e-back, with a nu|merous retinue, who led Jerome, in fetters, by a long chain, after him.</P>
<P>He was brought immediately before the council. Here a citation was read to him;
<PB N="235" REF="254">
which, it was &s;aid, had been po&s;ted up in Con&s;tance, in an&s;wer to the papers, which he had &s;ent from Iberling; and he was que&s;tioned about his precipitate flight from that town. To this he an&s;wered, that he had waited a rea&s;onable time for an an&s;wer to his paper; but had never heard of any &s;uch an&s;wer till that moment. He added, that if he had heard of it, he would have returned to Con&s;tance, though he had been upon the confines of Bohemia.</P>
<P>Great was the clamour which en&s;ued on this declaration. So eager was every mouth to open upon him, that the impartial &s;pecta|tor &s;aw rather the repre&s;entation of the bait|ing of a wild bea&s;t, than a wi&s;e a&s;&s;embly enquiring after truth. Nothing indeed more di&s;graceth the popi&s;h cau&s;e, than the gro&s;s indecency, which, in a manner, was au|thorized on the&s;e &s;olemn occa&s;ions. A good cau&s;e hath never recour&s;e to tumult.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e, who clamoured loude&s;t again&s;t Jerome, we find a per&s;on, whom we are unwilling to &s;ee mixing in &s;uch a &s;cene of di&s;order; &mdash; John Ger&s;on, chancellor of the univer&s;ity of Paris, one of the mo&s;t learned, as well as the mo&s;t knowing men
<PB N="236" REF="255">
of his time, but without that candour which u&s;ually attends knowledge. With great acrimony he reproached Jerome for the novel opinions he had introduced in Paris, while he &s;tudied there. Jerome an&s;wered with equal &s;pirit, that it was hard to object opi|nions of &s;o long a date; &mdash; that it was well known the di&s;putations of young &s;tudents were meant rather as the exerci&s;e of genius, than as &s;trict di&s;qui&s;itions of truth; &mdash; that no exceptions, at this time, had been made to the opinions, which he had maintained; &mdash; &s;o far from it, that he had been honoured with a degree; &mdash; but that however, if the chancellor would make his objections, he would be ready either to defend, or retract what he had &s;aid.</P>
<P>As the chancellor was about to reply, an inundation of furious language broke in upon their di&s;cour&s;e. The rectors particu|larly of the univer&s;ities of Cologn, and Heidelburgh, following the track of Ger&s;on, made lamentable complaints of the pe&s;tilent here&s;ies which Jerome had maintained in tho&s;e places; one of them in particular dwelt much upon an impious idea he had given of the Trinity, comparing it to water, &s;now,
<PB N="237" REF="256">
and ice. Jerome had no opportunity of an&s;wering. A thou&s;and voices bur&s;t out from every quarter, <Q>Away with him: burn him: burn him.</Q></P>
<P>This confu&s;ion continued nearly the &s;pace of half an hour. Jerome &s;tood amazed at the gro&s;s indecency of the &s;cene. As &s;oon as he had collected him&s;elf, and could in any degree be heard, he looked round the a&s;&s;em|bly with a noble air, and cried out aloud, <Q>Since nothing can &s;atisfy you but my blood, God's will be done!</Q></P>
<P>Thus ended his fir&s;t hearing. He was carried from the a&s;&s;embly into a dungeon, under the cu&s;tody of a guard, till it could be determined how to di&s;po&s;e of him.</P>
<P>As he was &s;itting here, ruminating upon his approaching fate, a voice &s;truck him, calling out in the&s;e words, <Q>Fear not, Jerome, to die in the cau&s;e of that truth, which, during thy life, thou ha&s;t defend|ed.</Q> Jerome looking up to a dark win|dow, from whence the voice &s;eemed to come, cried out, <Q>Whoever thou art, who deigne&s;t to comfort an abject man, I give thee thanks for thy kind office. I have indeed lived defending what I thought the
<PB N="238" REF="257">
truth: the harder ta&s;k yet remains, to die for its &s;ake: but God, I hope, will &s;up|port me again&s;t fle&s;h and blood.</Q></P>
<P>This conver&s;ation alarmed the guard, who ru&s;hing in di&s;covered the offender. He ap|peared to be that Maddonwitz, who&s;e &s;er|vices to Hu&s;s have already been mentioned.</P>
<P>The affair was u&s;ed as a pretence for more &s;everity again&s;t Jerome, who was immedi|ately conveyed to a &s;trong tower, where his hands being tied behind his neck, he was left to langui&s;h in that painful po&s;ture, during the &s;pace of two days, without any aliment, but bread and water.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everities, and others, which were inflicted upon him, were intended to force a recantation from him; a point which the council exceedingly laboured. Nothing, in the way either of promi&s;ing or threatening, was omitted, which, it was thought, might be effectual to that end.</P>
<P>His confinement brought upon him a dangerous illne&s;s; in the cour&s;e of which he &s;ent pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances to the council for a confe&s;&s;or. This afforded a proper occa&s;ion to work upon him; and he was given to
<PB N="239" REF="258">
under&s;tand, upon what terms he might be gratified. But he remained immoveable.</P>
<P>The next attempt upon him, was imme|diately after the death of Hu&s;s. The cir|cum&s;tances of that affair were laid before him, and the fatal example pre&s;&s;ed home in the mo&s;t affecting manner. Jerome li&s;tened without emotion; and an&s;wered in &s;uch re|&s;olute language, as afforded little hopes of his &s;udden conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>His con&s;tancy, however, at length gave way. Fle&s;h and blood could not &s;upport him longer. The &s;imple fear of death he with&s;tood; but to endure impri&s;onment, chains, hunger, &s;ickne&s;s, and even torture, through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of many months, was too great a trial for human nature. But though he fell in this conflict, yet he fell not, till he had made a noble &s;tand. He was three times brought before the council; and having as often with&s;tood the fury of intemperate zeal, retired, ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, to the horrors of his dungeon.</P>
<P>On the 11th of September his judges fir&s;t had hopes of his recantation. He began to waver; and talked ob&s;curely of his having mi&s;under&s;tood the tendency of &s;ome of the
<PB N="240" REF="259">
tenets of Hu&s;s. Promi&s;es and threatenings were now redoubled upon him; and the 20th was appointed for a more ample con|fe&s;&s;ion of his here&s;ies. He was &s;ounded the night before; but not being yet brought to a proper flexibility, another day was appoint|ed. That fatal day was the 23d of Sep|tember; when he read aloud an ample re|cantation, of all the opinions he had main|tained, couched in words directed by the council. In this paper he acknowledged the errors of Wicliff, and of Hu&s;s, entirely a&s;&s;ented to the condemnation of the latter, and declared him&s;elf, in every article, a firm believer with the church of Rome.</P>
<P>Having thus acted again&s;t his con&s;cience, with a heavy heart he retired from the coun|cil. His chains indeed were taken from him; but the load was only transferred from his body to his mind. Vain were the care&s;&s;es of tho&s;e about him: they only mocked his &s;orrow. His pri&s;on was now indeed a gloomy &s;olitude. The angui&s;h of his own thoughts had made it &s;uch.</P>
<P>Paletz, and Du Ca&s;&s;is, who were the chief managers again&s;t him, as they had been again&s;t Hu&s;s, &s;oon ob&s;erved this change.
<PB N="241" REF="260">
His recantation, they &s;aid publicly, came only from his lips; and they determined, to bring him to a &s;econd hearing. It is proba|ble indeed they acted in this bu&s;ine&s;s only an under-part. The pretence for a new trial was a new accu&s;ation. Some Carmelite friars, ju&s;t arrived from Bohemia, laid before the council many &s;trong articles again&s;t Je|rome, which had not yet appeared. Paletz taking up the affair, &s;econded the Carmelites with great zeal: others again, as the &s;cheme had been laid, harangued on different arti|cles.</P>
<P>The managers however of this bu&s;ine&s;s &s;oon found, they were likely to meet with a warmer oppo&s;ition than they had imagined. The cardinals particularly of Cambray and Florence, and others, who had been ap|pointed judges by the council in the cau&s;e of Jerome, loudly exclaimed again&s;t a &s;econd trial. <Q>He hath &s;ubmitted, (&s;aid they,) to the council; &mdash; he hath acknowledged his errors in particular, as well as in general, what can we expect more? Hitherto we have acted with credit: let us &s;top here, and not &s;uffer an intemperate zeal for truth to carry us beyond the bounds of ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="261">Whether the love of ju&s;tice was the only motive with the&s;e cardinals may be que&s;tion|ed. It is probable they were influenced by motives of policy al&s;o. The death of Hu&s;s had occa&s;ioned a greater commotion in Bo|hemia than had been fore&s;een. Nothing was heard in the &s;treets of Prague, but cla|mour again&s;t the council, which was every where repre&s;ented as an a&s;&s;embly of per&s;e|cutors. The council, it &s;eems, had written a letter, in very &s;mooth language, to palliate what had been done in the ca&s;e of Hu&s;s: but it had little effect. On the contrary, the principal Hu&s;&s;ites, (for by that name the party became now di&s;tingui&s;hed,) a&s;&s;embled in the church of Bethelem, where they de|creed the honour of martyrdom to their ma&s;ter. They went farther: they &s;ent a letter to Con&s;tance; in which, having given ample te&s;timony to the merits of Hu&s;s, they reproached the council with his death; ex|pre&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame time their devotion to the &s;ee of Rome, when the confu&s;ion, with which it was di&s;tracted, &s;hould be at an end. This letter was &s;igned by 54 of the fir&s;t nobility in Bohemia, and Moravia: &s;ome Poli&s;h lords too &s;ub&s;cribed it. Nor was it
<PB N="243" REF="262">
thought that Wince&s;laus him&s;elf, though no way attached to the cau&s;e of Hu&s;s, had in|terfered in checking the di&s;turbance occa|&s;ioned by his death. It is certain, he had taken great offence at the council for the affront, which he thought they had put upon him; and wanted only an opportunity of &s;hewing them how much he was offended.</P>
<P>From the determined &s;pirit of this letter, it was ea&s;y to ob&s;erve the &s;eeds of fire &s;cat|tered in Bohemia, which a &s;ingle breath might excite into flame; and how general this flame might afterwards become, it was impo&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee. All well-wi&s;hers there|fore to the peace of Chri&s;tendom, thought it prudent to refrain from coun&s;els of an inflammatory kind.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e, it is probable, were the cardinals ju&s;t mentioned; who laboured, with what addre&s;s they were able, to prevent a &s;econd trial. But their endeavours were ineffectual. A torrent of zeal and bigotry bore down all oppo&s;ition. Even the learned Ger&s;on joined in this unmanly clamour; and with great indecency employed his pen, as well as his tongue, upon the occa&s;ion. A treati&s;e of his was made public, in which he
<PB N="244" REF="263">
&s;hewed how little &s;tre&s;s could be laid upon the recantation of heretics. To &s;uch an height ran di&s;&s;ention on this occa&s;ion, that the cardinal of Cambray was even reproach|ed in public, on a &s;uppo&s;ition of having taken money from the king of Bohemia.</P>
<P>He, and his colleagues, finding them|&s;elves unable to &s;tem &s;o furious a tide, at length gave way to it. They entered their prote&s;t however again&s;t the&s;e violent proceed|ings, and laid down the commi&s;&s;ion, with which the council had intru&s;ted them. It was immediately taken up, with the general approbation of all the zealot-party, by the patriarch of Con&s;tantinople; who having &s;ufficiently &s;hewn his &s;pirit in the affair of Hu&s;s, was con&s;idered as a man prepared to go any lengths.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were in agitation, a full half-year elap&s;ed; during which time Jerome's enemies had influence enough to continue his confinement, till &s;ome end &s;hould be put to the affair.</P>
<P>It was not till the May of the year 1416, that Jerome was called again before the council. He had long been apprized of the de&s;ign of bringing him to a &s;econd trial
<PB N="245" REF="264">
upon &s;ome new evidence which had appear|ed. This, amid&s;t all his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, was his great con&s;olation; and he rejoiced at an op|portunity of acknowledging publickly that &s;hameful defection, which hung &s;o heavy upon him.</P>
<P>A little before the day of trial, he was in|formed, that proctors were appointed, by whom he might urge his defence. But he in&s;i&s;ted po&s;itively upon making no defence in any form, unle&s;s the council would give him an audience; and let him an&s;wer for him&s;elf. This, after much difficulty, and long debatings, was at length allowed.</P>
<P>When he was brought to an audience, he was charged with various articles; the chief of which were,&mdash;His adherence to the errors of Wicliff,&mdash;his having had a picture of that heretic in his chamber, arrayed in the com|mon ornaments of a &s;aint,&mdash;his counterfeit|ing the &s;eal of the univer&s;ity of Oxford in favour of Wicliff,&mdash;His de&s;pi&s;ing the autho|rity of the church after excommunication,&mdash; and his denial of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation.</P>
<P>On all the&s;e articles of accu&s;ation, and what others of le&s;s moment were objected to him, he an&s;wered with great &s;pirit.
<PB N="246" REF="265">
"That he thought well of Wicliff, and of his doctrine, he &s;aid, he &s;crupled not to own; but that he thought him infallible, as &s;eemed to be in&s;inuated, was fal&s;e; &mdash; that many of his books he had never &s;een; and that he could not &s;ub&s;cribe in all points to tho&s;e he had: but that in general he believed many errors had been laid to his charge, of which he was innocent; for he was too wi&s;e a man, he &s;aid, to be the author of gro&s;s ab&s;urdities, many of which his enemies had in&s;erted in his creed. &mdash; With regard to his having had a picture of Wicliff in his po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, he &s;aid, it was very true; and that he had the pictures likewi&s;e of many other learned men; but he remembred not, he &s;aid, that Wicliff's portrait was dre&s;&s;ed in any &s;aint-like ornaments; &mdash; that as to the charge of his having counterfeited the &s;eal of the univer&s;ity of Oxford, he had &s;een, he &s;aid, a te&s;timonial under that &s;eal, in favour of Wicliff, which he had been made to be|lieve was authentic: he owned too, that he had read it publickly; but that as to his having counterfeited either the &s;eal, or the in&s;trument, he was totally innocent of the charge; and it re&s;ted upon his opponents to
<PB N="247" REF="266">
prove the allegation. This affair of a fal&s;e te&s;timonial made much noi&s;e, it &s;eems, at that time. But from the general temper of the univer&s;ity it is probable, the in&s;trument was authentic; and the evidence of hi&s;tory confirms its authenticity.&mdash;Finally, Jerome declared &s;olemnly, that he had never de&s;pi&s;ed the authority of the church: he could prove, he &s;aid, that he had u&s;ed every probable method in his power to be reconciled to it;&mdash; and that la&s;tly, he had never, either in con|ver&s;ation, or writing, oppo&s;ed the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation.</P>
<P>Having thus prote&s;ted his innocence, he gave the council a circum&s;tantial detail of his coming to Con&s;tance; and of all that had &s;ince befallen him. Then rai&s;ing his voice, and expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf fir&s;t with &s;ome a&s;perity again&s;t his accu&s;ers, he told them, he was now going to lay him&s;elf more open to them, than he had yet done. He then, with great emotion, declared before the whole a&s;&s;embly, that the fear of death only had induced him to retract opinions, which from his heart he maintained; &mdash; that he had done inju&s;tice to the memory of tho&s;e two excellent men, John Wicliff, and John
<PB N="248" REF="267">
Hu&s;s; who&s;e examples he revered; and in who&s;e doctrine he was determined to die. He concluded with a &s;evere invective again&s;t the clergy; the depravity of who&s;e manners, he &s;aid, was now every where notorious.</P>
<P>It may truly be lamented, that the whole of his &s;peech, upon this occa&s;ion, hath not been pre&s;erved. It is &s;aid to have been a model of true eloquence. The minds of his hearers were &s;o captivated with it, that, in &s;pite of them&s;elves, they were attentive. Once or twice he was interrupted; but the interrupters paid &s;everely for their imperti|nence: they were &s;oon la&s;hed into confu&s;ion by the acrimony of his language, and the &s;pirit, with which he &s;poke. So collected was he, &s;o entirely ma&s;ter of him&s;elf; and of every topic, on which he di&s;cour&s;ed, that it &s;eemed as if heaven had indulged him, on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion, in the exertion of more than natural powers. It is &s;aid, that many in the council, while he was &s;peaking, became &s;o prejudiced in his favour, that they &s;at with a dread upon them, le&s;t he &s;hould utter &s;omething, which might throw him beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of obtaining mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="268">His &s;peech however was not calculated to move pity. On the &s;ame day, or a few days after, &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon him, by which he was condemned for having held the errors of Wicliff; and for apo&s;tatizing. He was immediately, in the u&s;ual &s;tile of popi&s;h affectation, delivered over to the civil power. As he was a layman, he had no ceremony of degradation to undergo. The &s;ame &s;ort of cap was put upon his head, with which Hu&s;s had been adorned; and &s;o attired he was led to execution.</P>
<P>When he came to the place, he could not but &s;mile to &s;ee the malice of his enemies appearing in a &s;hape too grote&s;que for &s;o &s;erious an occa&s;ion. The po&s;t, to which he was chained, was hewn, it &s;eems, into a mon&s;trous, and uncouth figure of Hu&s;s, and ornamented into a ridiculous likene&s;s of him.</P>
<P>A little before the fire was kindled, he told the people, that he believed the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed creed, and that he knew not for what he &s;uffered death, unle&s;s becau&s;e he had not &s;ub&s;cribed to the condemnation of Wicliff, and of Hu&s;s; which he could not do with
<PB N="250" REF="269">
a &s;afe con&s;cience; becau&s;e he firmly believed them both to be pious men.</P>
<P>The wood beginning to blaze, he &s;ang an hymn, which he continued with great fer|vency, till the fury of the fire &s;corching him, he was heard to cry out, <Q>O Lord God! have mercy upon me! have mercy upon me!</Q> And a little afterwards, <Q>Thou knowe&s;t how I have loved thy truth.</Q> The wind parting the flames, his body, full of large bli&s;ters, exhibited a dreadful &s;pecta|cle to the beholders; his lips continued &s;till moving, as if actuated by inten&s;e devotion. During a full quarter of an hour, he di&s;|covered the &s;igns not only of life, but of intellect. &mdash; Even his enemies thought the rage of his judges pur&s;ued him too far, when they &s;aw his wretched coverlet, and the other mi&s;erable garniture of his pri&s;on, by their order, con&s;umed in the fire after him; and his a&s;hes, as tho&s;e of Hu&s;s had been, thrown into the Rhine.</P>
<P>From this account of the trial, and death of Jerome, it &s;eems as if the leading mem|bers of the council were determined, at any rate, to put him to death. We cannot other|wi&s;e &s;ee the rea&s;on of their bringing him to
<PB N="251" REF="270">
a &s;econd hearing. They had already obtain|ed a triumph over him. A &s;econd trial made that again doubtful, which his recanta|tion had decided in their favour. But it hath been the notorious practice of the church of Rome, in her dealings with ca|pital offenders, to put them fir&s;t to &s;hame, and afterwards to death.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e, who have treated of the death of Jerome, none hath done him more honour than Pogg&egrave; the Florentine. The anecdotes of him pre&s;erved by this writer have not yet been laid before the reader. As Pogg&egrave; was not only a man of &s;ome eminence, but an adver&s;ary likewi&s;e to the cau&s;e of Je|rome, his te&s;timony is of too much con&s;e|quence to be kneaded with the ma&s;s of other authorities; and will appear to mo&s;t advan|tage by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>This eminent per&s;on had been bred in the court of Rome; and having been &s;ecretary under two popes, was well in&s;tructed in its de&s;igns. Here too he had every opportunity of gratifying his inclination for &s;tudy; and was ver&s;ed alike in bu&s;ine&s;s, and in letters. He had a ta&s;te for poetry likewi&s;e; and gain|ed great credit by &s;ome &s;atyrical compo&s;itions,
<PB N="252" REF="271">
which he publi&s;hed in the early part of his life. To his other prai&s;es he added that of an hi&s;torian. His hi&s;tory of Florence is e&s;teemed an elegant at lea&s;t, though a par|tial compo&s;ition. But the world is mo&s;t in|debted to him as an antiquarian. To his in|du&s;try we owe many noble remains of an|tiquity, which he redeemed from that ob|&s;curity, in which barbari&s;m had involved them; particularly the works of Quinctilian; which he had the happine&s;s to find compleat in a ruined mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>In what capacity he attended the council, we have no account. As he relates matter of fact only, it is of little con&s;equence. The examination, and death of Jerome, of which he was an eye-witne&s;s, affected him in &s;o &s;trong a manner, that he gave a full account of both to his friend Aretin at Rome, as the mo&s;t extraordinary events he had met with, during his re&s;idence at Con&s;tance. The reader will con&s;ider his letter on this occa|&s;ion, as a portrait warm from the life; and, if not a fini&s;hed picture, at lea&s;t a very &s;pirited &s;ketch. It was written originally in Latin. The following is not meant as a literal tran|&s;lation. Tho&s;e circum&s;tances, with which
<PB N="253" REF="272">
the reader hath been already made ac|quainted, in the cour&s;e of the narrative, are omitted.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>A letter from Pogg&egrave; of Florence to Leonard Aretin.</HEAD>
<P><Q>In the mid&s;t of a &s;hort excur&s;ion into the country, I wrote to our common friend; from whom, I doubt not, you have had an account of me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Since my return to Con&s;tance, my at|tention hath been wholly engaged by Je|rome, the Bohemian heretic, as he is called. The eloquence, and learning, which this per&s;on hath employed in his own defence are &s;o extraordinary, that I cannot forbear giving you a &s;hort account of him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To confe&s;s the truth, I never knew the art of &s;peaking carried &s;o near the model of ancient eloquence. It was indeed amazing to hear with what force of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, with what fluency of language, and with what excellent rea&s;oning he an|&s;wered his adver&s;aries; nor was I le&s;s &s;truck with the gracefulne&s;s of his manner; the
<PB N="254" REF="273">
dignity of his action; and the firmne&s;s, and con&s;tancy of his whole behaviour. It grieved me to think &s;o great a man was la|bouring under &s;o atrocious an accu&s;ation. Whether this accu&s;ation be a ju&s;t one, God knows: for my&s;elf, I enquire not into the merits of it; re&s;ting &s;atisfied with the deci&s;ion of my &s;uperiors.&mdash;But I will ju&s;t give you a &s;ummary of his trial.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After many articles had been proved again&s;t him, leave was at length given him to an&s;wer each in its order. But Je|rome long refu&s;ed, &s;trenuou&s;ly contending, that he had many things to &s;ay previou&s;ly in his defence; and that he ought fir&s;t to be heard in general, before he de&s;cended to particulars. When this was over-ruled, Here, &s;aid he, &s;tanding in the mid&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly, here is ju&s;tice; here is equity. Be&s;et by my enemies, I am already pro|nounced a heretic: I am condemned, be|fore I am examined. &mdash; Were you God's omni&s;cient, in&s;tead of an a&s;&s;embly of fal|lible men, you could not act with more &s;ufficiency. &mdash; Error is the lot of mortals; and you, exalted as you are, are &s;ubject to it. But con&s;ider, that the higher you
<PB N="255" REF="274">
are exalted, of the more dangerous con|&s;equence are your errors. &mdash; As for me, I know I am a wretch below your notice: but at lea&s;t con&s;ider, that an unju&s;t action, in &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly, will be of dangerous example.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This, and much more, he &s;poke with great elegance of language, in the mid&s;t of a very unruly and indecent a&s;&s;embly: and thus far at lea&s;t he prevailed; the council ordered, that he &s;hould fir&s;t an&s;wer objections; and promi&s;ed that he &s;hould then have liberty to &s;peak. Accordingly, all the articles alledged again&s;t him were publicly read; and then proved; after which he was a&s;ked, whether he had ought to object? It is incredible with what acute|ne&s;s he an&s;wered; and with what amazing dexterity he warded off every &s;troke of his adver&s;aries. Nothing e&s;caped him: his whole behaviour was truly great and pious. If he were indeed the man his defence &s;poke him, he was &s;o far from meriting death, that, in my judgment, he was not in any degree culpable. &mdash; In a word, he endeavoured to prove, that the greater part of the charge was purely the inven|tion
<PB N="256" REF="275">
of his adver&s;aries. &mdash; Among other things, being accu&s;ed of hating and de|faming the holy &s;ee, the pope, the cardi|nals, the prelates, and the whole e&s;tate of the clergy, he &s;tretched out his hands, and &s;aid, in a mo&s;t moving accent, "On which &s;ide, reverend fathers, &s;hall I turn me for redre&s;s? whom &s;hall I implore? who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance can I expect? which of you hath not this malicious charge entirely alienated from me? which of you hath it not changed from a judge into an invete|rate enemy?&mdash;It was artfully alledged in|deed! Though other parts of their charge were of le&s;s moment, my accu&s;ers might well imagine, that if this were fa&s;tened on me, it could not fail of drawing upon me the united indignation of my judges.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On the third day of this memorable trial, what had pa&s;t was recapitulated: when Jerome, having obtained leave, tho' with &s;ome difficulty, to &s;peak, began his oration with a prayer to God; who&s;e di|vine a&s;&s;i&s;tance he pathetically implored. He then ob&s;erved, that many excellent men, in the annals of hi&s;tory, had been oppre&s;&s;ed by fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es, and con|demned
<PB N="257" REF="276">
by unju&s;t judges. Beginning with profane hi&s;tory, he in&s;tanced the death of Socrates, the captivity of Plato, the bani&s;hment of Anaxagoras, and the unju&s;t &s;ufferings of many others: he then in&s;tanced the many worthies, of the old Te&s;tament, in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, Daniel, and almo&s;t all the prophets; and la&s;tly tho&s;e of the new, John the bapti&s;t, St. Stephen, and others, who were condemned as &s;editious, pro|phane, or immoral men. An unju&s;t judg|ment, he &s;aid, proceeding from a layic was bad; from a prie&s;t, wor&s;e; &s;till wor&s;e from a college of prie&s;ts; and from a ge|neral council, &s;uperlatively bad. &mdash; The&s;e things he &s;poke with &s;uch force and em|pha&s;is, as kept every one's attention awake.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On one point he dwelt largely. As the merits of the cau&s;e re&s;ted entirely upon the credit of witne&s;&s;es, he took great pains to &s;hew, that very little was due to tho&s;e produced again&s;t him. He had many objections to them, particularly their avowed hatred to him; the &s;ources of which he &s;o palpably laid open, that he made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon the minds
<PB N="258" REF="277">
of his hearers; and not a little &s;hook the credit of the witne&s;&s;es. The whole coun|cil was moved; and greatly inclined to pity, if not to favour him. He added, that he came uncompelled to the council; and that neither his life nor doctrine had been &s;uch, as gave him the lea&s;t rea&s;on to dread an appearance before them. Dif|ference of opinion, he &s;aid, in matters of faith had ever ari&s;en among learned men; and was always e&s;teemed productive of truth, rather than of error, where bigotry was laid a&s;ide. Such, he &s;aid, was the difference between Au&s;tin and Jerome: and though their opinions were not only different, but contradictory, yet the im|putation of here&s;y was never fixed on either.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Every one expected, that he would now either retract his errors, or at lea&s;t apologize for them: but nothing of the kind was heard from him: he declared plainly, that he had nothing to retract. He launched out into an high encomium of Hu&s;s; calling him a holy man; and lamenting his cruel, and unju&s;t death. He had armed him&s;elf, he &s;aid, with a
<PB N="259" REF="278">
full re&s;olution to follow the &s;teps of that ble&s;&s;ed martyr; and to &s;uffer with con|&s;tancy whatever the malice of his enemies could inflict. "The perjured witne&s;&s;es, (&s;aid he,) who have appeared again&s;t me, have won their cau&s;e: but let them re|member, they have their evidence once more to give before a tribunal, where fal&s;hood can be no di&s;gui&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It was impo&s;&s;ible to hear this pathetic &s;peaker without emotion. Every ear was captivated; and every heart touched. &mdash; But wi&s;hes in his favour were vain: he threw him&s;elf beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of mercy. Braving death, he even provoked the vengeance, which was hanging over him. "If that holy martyr, (&s;aid he, &s;peaking of Hu&s;s,) u&s;ed the clergy with di&s;re&s;pect, his cen&s;ures were not levelled at them as prie&s;ts, but as wicked men. He &s;aw with indignation tho&s;e revenues, which had been de&s;igned for charitable ends, expended upon pageantry, and riot.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Through this whole oration he &s;hewed a mo&s;t amazing &s;trength of memory. He had been confined almo&s;t a year in a dun|geon:
<PB N="260" REF="279">
the &s;everity of which u&s;age he complained of, but in the language of a great and good man. In this horrid place he was deprived of books and paper. Yet notwith&s;tanding this, and the con&s;tant anxiety, which mu&s;t have hung over him, he was at no more lo&s;s for proper authori|ties, and quotations, than if he had &s;pent the intermediate time at lei&s;ure in his &s;tudy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>His voice was &s;weet, di&s;tinct, and full: his action every way the mo&s;t proper either to expre&s;s indignation, or to rai&s;e pity; though he made no affected application to the pa&s;&s;ions of his audience. Firm, and intrepid he &s;tood before the council; col|lected in him&s;elf; and not only contemn|ing, but &s;eeming even de&s;irous of death. The greate&s;t character in ancient &s;tory could not po&s;&s;ibly go beyond him. If there is any ju&s;tice in hi&s;tory, this man will be admired by all po&s;terity.&mdash;I &s;peak not of his errors: let the&s;e re&s;t with him. What I admired was his learning, his elo|quence, and amazing acutene&s;s. God knows whether the&s;e things were not the ground-work of his ruin.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="280"><Q>Two days were allowed him for re|flection; during which time many per&s;ons of con&s;equence, and particularly my lord cardinal of Florence, endeavoured to bring him to a better mind. But per&s;i&s;ting ob|&s;tinately in his errors, he was condemned as an heretic.</Q></P>
<P><Q>With a chearful countenance, and more than Stoical con&s;tancy, he met his fate; fearing neither death it&s;elf, nor the horri|ble form, in which it appeared. When he came to the place, he pulled of his upper garment, and made a &s;hort prayer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Flexis genibus veneratus e&s;t palum</HI> (&s;aith the original.) This certainly mu&s;t have been a fal&s;e interpretation of his praying <HI>with his face turned towards the &s;take.</HI> But other hi&s;torians, on Pogg&egrave;'s authority, have taken up the notion, that he <HI>prayed to the &s;take.</HI></NOTE> at the &s;take; to which he was &s;oon after bound with wet cords, and an iron chain; and inclo&s;ed as high as his brea&s;t with faggots.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ob&s;erving the executioner about to &s;et fire to the wood behind his back, he cried out, "Bring thy torch hither. Perform thy office before my face. Had I feared death, I might have avoided it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="281"><Q>As the wood began to blaze, he &s;ang an hymn, which the violence of the flame &s;carce interrupted.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus died this prodigious man. The epithet is not extravagant. I was my&s;elf an eye-witne&s;s of his whole behaviour. Whatever his life may have been, his death, without doubt, is a noble le&s;&s;on of philo&s;ophy.</Q></P>

<HEAD><PB N="265" REF="284">The Life of ZISCA.</HEAD>
<P>IN the lives of John Hu&s;s, and Jerome of Prague, we have &s;een great in&s;tances of the violence and inju&s;tice of the council of Con&s;tance. That bigotted a&s;&s;embly ap|peared ready to embrace any mea&s;ures, and to run any lengths, to e&s;tabli&s;h the tyranny of the church of Rome. The life of Zi&s;ca exhibits tho&s;e &s;cenes of di&s;order and ruin, which might be expected as the natural con&s;equences of &s;uch furious zeal.</P>
<P>The real name of this eminent per&s;on was John de Troeznow. The epithet Zi&s;ca was given him from his having lo&s;t an eye; that word, in the Bohemian language, &s;ignifying one-eyed. He was a native of Bohemia; born of a good family, remarkable rather for its credit, than its wealth.</P>
<P>In the early part of his life Zi&s;ca was in|troduced to Wince&s;laus, whom he &s;erved in
<PB N="266" REF="285">
the capacity of a page: but being tired of a &s;ubjection to the capricious and trifling hu|mours of that prince, he gave up all ex|pectations from royal favour, and left his country, with a re&s;olution to &s;eek his fortune abroad. His intention was to enter into &s;ome military &s;ervice; having from his earlie&s;t youth di&s;covered a &s;trong inclination to the profe&s;&s;ion of arms.</P>
<P>He lived &s;ome time in Denmark, and afterwards in lower Saxony; but we find him not in any employment, till the break|ing out of the wars in Poland, again&s;t the knights of the Teutonic order.</P>
<P>The Poles embracing Chri&s;tianity earlier than their neighbours, &s;uffered from &s;ome of them a &s;ort of national per&s;ecution. The irruptions of the Pru&s;&s;ians were particularly formidable; with which hardy people they waged a long and un&s;ucce&s;sful war. At length finding them&s;elves reduced, they called to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance the knights of the Teutonic order; by who&s;e alliance being &s;trengthened, they &s;oon brought their ene|mies to terms.</P>
<P>To recompence the&s;e foreigners, or more probably to fulfil a previous engagement,
<PB N="267" REF="286">
they allowed them to &s;ettle in Poland, and di&s;tributed lands among them. But the Poles had &s;oon rea&s;on to repent of their civility. The&s;e in&s;olent inmates made early incroachments upon their benefactors; and matters proceeding to extremity, a bloody war broke out. Neither &s;ide had much rea&s;on to boa&s;t, till the year 1410; when the knights &s;uffered a total defeat: their grand-ma&s;ter was killed, and their whole army very &s;everely handled.</P>
<P>Zi&s;ca, who had entered, at the begining of the war, into the &s;ervice of the king of Poland, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf greatly in this battle. He led a battalion in that wing, which fir&s;t turned the fortune of the day. The king pre&s;ented him with a pur&s;e of ducats for his &s;ervices; and accompanied his liberality with a badge of honour.</P>
<P>The Poli&s;h generals however not pur&s;uing their victory as they ought, the knights &s;o far collected them&s;elves, as to enter with a good face into negotiation. A treaty was &s;oon afterwards concluded; and Zi&s;ca find|ing his &s;word of no farther u&s;e in Poland, returned into Bohemia; where we meet him again, notwith&s;tanding his former prejudices,
<PB N="268" REF="287">
in the court of Wince&s;laus; and in office about his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Upon the tragical fate of Hu&s;s, which threw all Bohemia into confu&s;ion, no one felt more acutely than Zi&s;ca. He did not however vent his indignation, like others, in clamour and threatening language; it &s;at in a melancholy gloom upon his brows, and &s;unk into his heart. The king, we are told, &s;eeing him, from a window of the palace, walking in a thoughtful po&s;ture, a&s;ked him, upon what &s;erious &s;ubject he was meditating? "Upon the bloody affront, an&s;wered Zi&s;ca, which your maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects have &s;uffered at Con&s;tance." "It is true, replied Win|ce&s;laus; but, I fear, it is neither in your power, nor in mine, to revenge it." This circum&s;tance, we are told, fir&s;t in&s;pired Zi&s;ca with a re&s;olution to a&s;&s;ert the religious liber|ties of his country.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the affair of Con&s;tance, he wanted not other motives to incite him to this enter|prize. Though a man of no great know|ledge in matters of divinity, he had &s;agacity enough to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of a thorough reformation in the di&s;cipline of the church. He had conceived likewi&s;e a &s;teady di&s;like
<PB N="269" REF="288">
to the clergy; founded more upon the cor|ruption of their lives, than of their doctrine. We are told too, he had per&s;onal cau&s;e of re&s;entment; a favourite &s;i&s;ter having been debauched by a monk.</P>
<P>But with whatever zeal Zi&s;ca and his friends were animated in private, in public they ob&s;erved a commendable temper. While the council &s;till &s;at, they had hope that &s;ome healing expedient might be found. Were the fathers there a&s;&s;embled in earne&s;t, it was impo&s;&s;ible, they imagined, but &s;ome|thing would be done to remove abu&s;es, and allay di&s;tempers, become now &s;o flagrant, and alarming. They re&s;olved however to wait the event.</P>
<P>With the&s;e vain hopes they were deluded, till the di&s;&s;olution of the council, in the beginning of the year 1418. Their eyes were now fully opened. That great a&s;&s;em|bly of Chri&s;tian bi&s;hops, from the re&s;ult of who&s;e coun&s;els, a full reformation of all abu&s;es was expected, were &s;o far from an|&s;wering tho&s;e &s;anguine hopes, that they left things very little better than they found them; many things wor&s;e, as &s;anctifyed by a new authority. <Q>Thus ended, (&s;ays the
<PB N="270" REF="289">
impartial Lenfant, in the conclu&s;ion of his hi&s;tory,) the famous council of Con&s;tance; in which it cannot be denyed, but that &s;ome things were done truly commend|able, though that a&s;&s;embly by no means an&s;wered the general expectation of the world. It condemned men, who at wor&s;t were only &s;omewhat too forward in their zeal again&s;t abu&s;es, which all &s;erious men acknowledged, and which even the coun|cil it&s;elf di&s;approved. It &s;pared errors likewi&s;e, which certainly tended to the de&s;truction of all true religion. But what placed it in the wor&s;t light, were the feeble efforts it made towards a reformation of the clergy; though it is evident, from the te&s;timony of all writers, that the refor|mation of the clergy was the avowed, and principal end it had in view.</Q></P>
<P>The council being di&s;&s;olved, the heads of the reforming party in Bohemia knew what they had now to expect. They knew they had nothing to depend upon for the pre|&s;ervation of their religious liberties, but their own &s;trength, and &s;pirit.</P>
<P>If any hope of favour from the court or Rome &s;till remained, it was wholly di&s;&s;ipated
<PB N="271" REF="290">
by a letter, which the new pope, Martin V. &s;ent into Bohemia, &s;oon after his election. This letter was directed to the Hu&s;&s;ites, whom he charges with many and great he|re&s;ies. In particular, he tells them, they had trampled upon the &s;tatues of the &s;aints, and the ceremonies of the church; &mdash; that they had celebrated the fea&s;ts of John Hu&s;s, and Jerome of Prague;&mdash;that the &s;acrament under both &s;pecies had been admini&s;tred among them;&mdash;and, in one word, that the church was never wor&s;e treated under Nero, than it had been by them. He &s;till however gives them hopes of favour, if they would return again within their ancient pale; but threatens, if they continued ob&s;tinate, to cut them off entirely from the church, and give them as a prey to their enemies.</P>
<P>Martin not re&s;ting his cau&s;e entirely upon this letter, &s;ent the cardinal Dominictis, as his legate, into Bohemia. This mini&s;ter &s;oon informed him&s;elf of the temper of the country; and, after a &s;hort and fruitle&s;s ne|gotiation, wrote letters to the pope, and to the emperor Sigi&s;mond, (who claimed the crown after Wince&s;laus, and was of cour&s;e greatly intere&s;ted in the affair,) acquainting
<PB N="272" REF="291">
them, it was in vain to expect any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from that country, through means le&s;s effectual than open force.</P>
<P>During this negotiation, the heads of the reforming party, fore&s;eeing the evil at a di&s;tance, concerted mea&s;ures for their &s;afety. In the &s;ummer of the year 1418 they had a general meeting at the ca&s;tle of Wi&s;grade; the de&s;ign of which was, to deliberate on the be&s;t means of pre&s;erving the liberties of the church of Bohemia. They had no re|verence for the pope; and very little for the emperor: with their own &s;overeign they were de&s;irous of keeping terms. Their fir&s;t re&s;olution therefore was to &s;ound the incli|nations of Wince&s;laus; that capricious prince having yet given them no certain evidence either of his favour, or aver&s;ion. With this view, they &s;ent deputies to the king; who, in the name of the a&s;&s;embly, acquainting him with the increa&s;ing numbers of their &s;ect, reque&s;ted the u&s;e of more churches.</P>
<P>Wince&s;laus was &s;urprized rather at the &s;pirit in which the reque&s;t was made, than at the reque&s;t it&s;elf. He was di&s;&s;atisfied, as much as they were, with the affair of Con|&s;tance; but he cho&s;e to have the re&s;entment
<PB N="273" REF="292">
due upon that occa&s;ion to appear as coming from him&s;elf; and he had no inclination, at this time, to &s;hew it. On the other hand, here was a violent party, which would take no denial; who&s;e &s;trength he knew as well as his own comparative weakne&s;s; and tho' it was hard for a monarch to receive law from his &s;ubjects, (for he could not but con&s;ider their reque&s;t as a demand,) yet the remem|brance of pa&s;t misfortunes had taught him to put many re&s;traints upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this perplexity, and to the darkne&s;s of his own character, he an&s;wered the deputies eva&s;ively. He was greatly in|clined, he &s;aid, to favour them; but di&s;ap|proved pa&s;&s;ion and tumult. He required them therefore to rely upon his honour; and, as a pledge of their good intentions, to depo&s;it their arms with him.</P>
<P>With this an&s;wer the deputies returned. It was by no means &s;atisfactory; and the more violent were for breaking all mea&s;ures forthwith. The debates of the&s;e fierce &s;pirits becoming tumultuous, Zi&s;ca &s;uddenly &s;tart|ing up, cried out, Gentlemen, <Q>I have long known the king, and am thoroughly ac|quainted with his temper: arm your&s;elves,
<PB N="274" REF="293">
and follow me.</Q> Thus attended he &s;tood before Wince&s;laus: <Q>Behold, (&s;aid he,) a body of your maje&s;ty's faithful &s;ubjects: we have brought our arms, as you com|manded: &s;hew us your enemies; and you &s;hall have rea&s;on to acknowledge, that our weapons can be in no hands more faithful to you, than in tho&s;e, which hold them.</Q> In a capricious, unprincipled mind, a &s;udden eva&s;ion hath often the weight of argument. It had on this occa&s;ion. Struck with the heroic language, and appearance of the&s;e brave men, the king cried out, <Q>Take your arms, gentlemen, and u&s;e them proper|ly.</Q>&mdash;This action fir&s;t recommended Zi&s;ca to the confidence of his party; and gave an earne&s;t of tho&s;e &s;trokes of policy, which his mind, fruitful of expedients, was afterwards found &s;o capable of di&s;playing.</P>
<P>The re&s;traint however, which Wince&s;laus put upon the reformers was &s;oon removed. Tired with the pa&s;t, and dreading the future, which he &s;aw approaching in a &s;torm, that unhappy prince at length gave way to the angui&s;h of his &s;pirit, and &s;unk under a weight of grief. His death was accelerated by a violent fit of pa&s;&s;ion, in the agony of
<PB N="275" REF="294">
which he expired; leaving it a conte&s;t among hi&s;torians, whether the man, or the prince was more contemptible in his character.</P>
<P>Upon the death of Wince&s;laus, the crown of Bohemia was claimed, as hath been &s;aid, by his brother, the emperor Sigi&s;mond. This claim made an entire change in the &s;y&s;tem of the reformers. They now &s;aw their civil, as well as religious liberties in danger; and came to an unanimous re&s;olu|tion to oppo&s;e the emperor at the hazard of their lives. They were per&s;uaded they had a con&s;titutional right to elect their own prince; and again&s;t Sigi&s;mond they had many objections. The &s;hare he had in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Con&s;tance had rendered him odious to the whole reforming party. But his avowed principles in favour of the court of Rome, were the grand ob&s;tacle.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the friends of the emperor, at the head of whom was the queen dowager, who had been appointed regent, took mea&s;ures to &s;upport his title. They proclaimed him at Prague; admini&s;tred oaths to tho&s;e in office about the court; and re|moved &s;uch as were thought ill-affected to his government.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="295">The reformers, unwilling to give the queen any advantage by their delay, took arms without farther he&s;itation; and cho&s;ing Zi&s;ca their general, declared war again&s;t all the adherents of the emperor, and upholders of the tyranny of the church of Rome.</P>
<P>The regular clergy felt the fir&s;t effects of this commotion. The&s;e, wherever found, Zi&s;ca treated with &s;ufficient &s;everity. <Q>Let us, &s;aid he, encouraging his men, drive the&s;e fatted hogs from their &s;ties.</Q></P>
<P>The queen regent alarmed at the&s;e pro|ceedings, wrote an account of them to the emperor; intreating &s;peedy aid, and a&s;&s;uring him, that the in&s;urrection was by no means trivial.</P>
<P>Sigi&s;mond was, at that time, engaged in an expedition again&s;t the Turks; and could not immediately, without &s;ome di&s;credit, turn his arms towards Bohemia. The queen, thus left to her&s;elf, exerted a &s;pirit pro|portioned to the emergence; and drawing together what troops &s;he was able, &s;trength|ened the works of Prague, and &s;hut her&s;elf up in it with a good garri&s;on. She was well a&s;&s;ured however the city was not wholly hers, the new town being chiefly inhabited by re|formers.
<PB N="277" REF="296">
With great &s;kill therefore &s;he for|tified all the avenues, which led from one town to the other; and in particular the bridge over the Muldaw.</P>
<P>The &s;tandard of the reformers having been erected only a few weeks, Zi&s;ca found him&s;elf at the head of 40,000 men; a body of troops le&s;s formidable for their numbers, than for their martial ardour. Well know|ing that action is the life of a tumultuary army, he took the field without delay; and finding him&s;elf in want of garri&s;ons, for al|mo&s;t every fortre&s;s in the kingdom was in the hands of the Imperiali&s;ts, he re&s;olved to open the campaign by the &s;iege of Pil&s;en. This town lay conveniently for him, as it was in the mid&s;t of a country greatly devoted to his intere&s;t. Here his troops fir&s;t &s;ignal|ized their courage. Though few of them had &s;een action before, they mounted the wall like veterans; and after a &s;hort di&s;pute became ma&s;ters of the fortre&s;s. Zi&s;ca hav|ing added to its works, put a garri&s;on into it, and made it a place of arms.</P>
<P>From hence he &s;ent out parties, and took in the ca&s;tles, and &s;trong holds in the neigh|bourhood: &s;o that in a little time he found
<PB N="278" REF="297">
all the &s;outh-we&s;t part of Bohemia in his hands; and his army greatly increa&s;ed by the&s;e conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>While Zi&s;ca was thus employed, his friends in Prague were endeavouring their utmo&s;t to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of that city. Notwith&s;tanding the watchful eye, which was continually upon them, they had their private meetings; and having formed a &s;cheme, they made a de&s;perate attempt to pa&s;s the Muldaw, where that river divides, at the i&s;le of St. Benedict. The encounter was &s;harp, and bloody: the imperiali&s;ts however maintained their po&s;t.</P>
<P>The reformers, not di&s;couraged, made their next attempt upon the bridge. Here they fought with incredible firmne&s;s, and with more &s;ucce&s;s. Five days, and five nights, with little intermi&s;&s;ion, the di&s;pute la&s;ted: during which time, both parties, as may be imagined, &s;uffered greatly; and &s;ome of the faire&s;t buildings of the town, particularly the great council-chamber, were de&s;troyed. The reformers at length carried their point; and the imperiali&s;ts took &s;helter in the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="298">The emperor was now alarmed in earne&s;t, He withdrew his troops &s;uddenly from the confines of Turkey, and making ha&s;ty marches towards Bohemia with part of his cavalry, appointed his army to follow his rout.</P>
<P>At Brin in Moravia he halted; and being greatly de&s;irous of bringing matters to a fair accommodation, he &s;ent deputies to Prague to treat of peace.</P>
<P>At the head of the&s;e deputies was Ga&s;par Selic, one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed &s;tate&s;|men of his time. His father was a German, and his mother an Italian. From the&s;e he inherited the good qualities of each people; the &s;olidity of the one; the in&s;inuating man|ners of the other; and the characteri&s;tic foibles of neither.</P>
<P>This artful mini&s;ter &s;oon put the emperor's affairs into a hopeful train. He managed all parties with &s;uch dexterity, convincing them how much it was their intere&s;t to coale&s;ce; that he &s;oon brought on a treaty. As a pre|liminary, Zi&s;ca gave up Pil&s;en, and all the other fortre&s;&s;es he had taken. He &s;eems indeed to have been influenced by the citi|zens of Prague; who, having &s;een their
<PB N="280" REF="299">
town mi&s;erably harra&s;&s;ed in the late com|motions, were already weary of the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>In this hopeful way were the affairs of the emperor, when an unhappy letter, which he wrote to the magi&s;trates of Prague, ruined all. In this letter, after congratulating them on the pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy peace, which he mentions as an event equally advantage|ous to all parties, he tells them, he hopes, they &s;hall never have occa&s;ion to repent the confidence they had placed in him; and promi&s;es to govern, after the model of his father, the emperor Charles. Whether by governing after the model of his father, Sigi&s;mond meant only in civil matters, which is mo&s;t probable; or whether he in&s;inuated his intention with regard to religion, it is certain he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf either negli|gently or imprudently. It was pre&s;ently caught up, and propagated among the re|formers, that the emperor had at la&s;t dealt hone&s;tly with them; &mdash; that he had now &s;hewn his full intention;&mdash;that he could not even keep on the di&s;gui&s;e, till he had them fairly in his power; &mdash; but, they thanked God, they had yet time to take other mea|&s;ures.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="300">If any thing was wanting, after this im|prudent letter, to ruin the intere&s;ts of Sigi&s;|mond in Bohemia, his impolite behaviour afterwards compleated the work. Having put the treaty of Prague, as he hoped, on a good footing, he went to Bre&s;law; where, it &s;eems, the &s;pirit of Zi&s;ca had diffu&s;ed it|&s;elf; and the citizens had &s;hewn &s;ome zeal in his cau&s;e. They opened their gates how|ever to the emperor; and received him with great appearance of devotion. Sigi&s;mond, in&s;tead of taking the&s;e half-formed &s;ubjects under his protection, and care&s;&s;ing them with tenderne&s;s, began with a &s;trict enquiry into the authors of the late di&s;turbances, many of whom he treated with &s;everity enough. The impolitic monarch was yet unacquainted with the &s;pirit of the&s;e men: he had not yet learned, that per&s;ecution in no &s;hape could &s;ubdue them; and that no|thing could work upon them, but gentle treatment, and great toleration.</P>
<P>The conduct of Sigi&s;mond at Bre&s;law was an alarm-bell from one end of Bohemia to the other. Not a man but was ready to take arms. <Q>What! &s;hall we &s;ee our&s;elves tame|ly &s;laughtered like &s;heep? Let us &s;hew this
<PB N="282" REF="301">
haughty tyrant, that we are not yet victims de&s;tin'd to his knife.</Q></P>
<P>The high &s;pirit, which was thus rai&s;ed among the reformers, &s;oon &s;hewed itelf in action. Their fir&s;t attempt was on the ca&s;tle of Prague; of the town they were already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This &s;trong fortre&s;s was maintained for the emperor by Zincho, a German officer, in whom the queen had great confidence. But he deceived her ex|pectation. Zi&s;ca, who knew the governor's foible, bad &s;o high for his virtue, that he became ma&s;ter of the ca&s;tle without &s;triking a blow.</P>
<P>Sigi&s;mond by this time &s;aw his errors; and had only left, if po&s;&s;ible, to retrieve them. The hopes of peace, he ob&s;erved, had great|ly di&s;&s;ipated the tumultuary army of the re|formers. He re&s;olved therefore to attack them with what troops he had about him, which con&s;i&s;ted only of a few regiments of hor&s;e, the gro&s;s of his army not being yet arrived; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to cru&s;h them, before they could well a&s;&s;ociate.</P>
<P>But Zi&s;ca, &s;ufficiently upon his guard, retreated before his un&s;kilful enemies into a mountainous and rocky country, where he
<PB N="283" REF="302">
knew their hor&s;e would only be an incum|brance to them. Having thus cho&s;en his ground, he drew up his &s;mall army, which was compo&s;ed entirely of infantry, in a very advantageous manner; and, on the 19th of Augu&s;t, 1420, pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the enemy.</P>
<P>The imperial generals &s;aw their danger, but knew not how to avoid it. To fight on hor&s;eback was impracticable: to retreat, barely po&s;&s;ible. Di&s;mounting they formed on foot. But Zi&s;ca &s;econding his conduct with his bravery, fell on them with &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible fury, that the imperiali&s;ts were immediately thrown into confu&s;ion; and were all either cut to pieces on the &s;pot, or &s;laughtered in the defiles.</P>
<P>The fabulous writers of tho&s;e times attri|bute this victory to a very improbable device of Zi&s;ca. He ordered the women, we are informed, who attended his camp, to &s;trew their handkerchiefs and aprons in the front of the army, in which the &s;purs of the imperiali&s;ts being intangled, the reformers had an ea&s;y victory.</P>
<P>Zi&s;ca, who&s;e army daily increa&s;ed, pur|&s;uing his conque&s;t, appeared &s;uddenly before
<PB N="284" REF="303">
Au&s;ca. This town had little favour to expect, having always treated the reformers with more than u&s;ual &s;everity; at the in&s;ti|gation chiefly of Ulric, the governor, a man of a &s;avage di&s;po&s;ition. The formality of a &s;iege not &s;uiting the circum&s;tances of Zi&s;ca, he made a general a&s;&s;ault; and after a &s;harp di&s;pute carried the town. He gave orders, the &s;ame day, to &s;et it on fire, and level it with the ground; leaving behind him a monument of his vengeance, ill-becoming the cau&s;e in which he fought. The un|happy Ulric, falling into his hands, was put to an ignominious death.</P>
<P>Zi&s;ca employed the &s;hort re&s;pite, which his enemies, at this time, allowed him, in fortifying a camp. Though the &s;ummer was wearing apace, yet he had rea&s;on to expect the emperor would lie quiet only till he had collected his troops. The pu&s;h, he doubted not, would be vigorous; and if any &s;ini&s;ter event &s;hould await him, he fore&s;aw, that all would be ruined, if he had no re|treat. Pil&s;en he had given up: Prague in|deed was in his hands; but Prague was a divided town; too exten&s;ive for a garri&s;on, and too populous.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="304">Near Bechin, the provincial town of its circle, about 40 miles &s;outh of Prague, an arm of the Muldaw, winding round a crag|gy hill, forms a penin&s;ula, the neck of which is &s;carce 30 feet broad. The hill it&s;elf is acce&s;&s;ible on one &s;ide only. This was the place which Zi&s;ca cho&s;e for his camp; a place, which nature had nobly fortified to his hand. The declivity he a&s;&s;igned to his companions, on which they pitched their tents; at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ummit he erected his own; inclo&s;ing the whole with a good rampart; and fortifying the neck of the penin&s;ula with a broad ditch, and two &s;trong towers. In time their tents became hou&s;es, his own pavilion a ca&s;tle, and the ramparts and ditches, impregnable walls. To this fortre&s;s he gave the name of Tabor, alluding to the hill on which it &s;tood. It makes, at this day, an appearance in the maps of Bo|hemia.</P>
<P>While Zi&s;ca was employed in this bu&s;i|ne&s;s, he had intelligence, that a body of imperial hor&s;e lay in the neighbourhood, ob&s;erving his motions. He took his oppor|tunity, and &s;urprizing them at midnight, &s;urrounded the village in which they were
<PB N="286" REF="305">
quartered; and made the whole party, con&s;i&s;ting of a thou&s;and men, pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>The action was trifling, but had con&s;e|quences, which Zi&s;ca did not fore&s;ee. He had long wanted a body of hor&s;e, which, in the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs, he had never been able to rai&s;e; and thought the &s;uits of armour and hor&s;es, which, on this occa&s;ion, fell into his hands, were a very valuable prize, as they might become a good foun|dation for a body of Cavalry; without which he never afterwards took the field. He was him&s;elf an excellent hor&s;eman, fond of hor&s;es, and of the management of them; and if in any one part of the general's duty he laid him&s;elf more particularly out, it &s;eems to have been in that of forming his cavalry.</P>
<P>The attention of Zi&s;ca was, at this time, for a few days, engaged in a very extraor|dinary manner. An enthu&s;ia&s;tic Picard; or, as others call him, a Fleming of the name of Picard, leaving his own country, and pa&s;&s;ing the Rhine, wandered into Bo|hemia. On his journey, he had drawn many followers of both &s;exes after him;
<PB N="287" REF="306">
whom he deceived by a &s;trange volubility of rhap&s;ody; and pretences to a power little le&s;s than almighty; of which he &s;eemed to give many very &s;urprizing in&s;tances. What|ever his impo&s;tures were, they were &s;uffici|ently adapted to the credulity of his follow|ers; with whom, and &s;uch pro&s;elytes as he gained in the country, he &s;eized an i&s;land upon the Muldaw, not far from Tabor, where he &s;ettled in the form of a &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Here he began to unfold his doctrines; which differed little from tho&s;e of the old Adamites, and were in a high degree impi|ous and dete&s;table. He declared him&s;elf the &s;on of God, called him&s;elf Adam; and pro|fe&s;&s;ing he was &s;ent to revive the law of na|ture, made his religion to con&s;i&s;t chiefly in the entire di&s;u&s;e of cloaths, and in the free indulgence of promi&s;cuous lu&s;t. The chil|dren, thus born, were accounted free; all mankind be&s;ides were con&s;idered as &s;laves.</P>
<P>The&s;e vile &s;ectaries &s;oon became a general pe&s;t. Among their other horrid extrava|gancies, they made an excur&s;ion into the country, and put to the &s;word not fewer than 200 of the pea&s;ants: <Q>They were
<PB N="288" REF="307">
&s;laves, and did not de&s;erve the breath of God.</Q></P>
<P>Zi&s;ca being now at lei&s;ure, was ea&s;ily wrought on by the de&s;ires of the country, to extirpate the&s;e execrable wretches. The pea&s;ants furni&s;hing boats, he invaded the i&s;land; and the Adamites, except a few, who died in arms, were all taken. They were equally involved in guilt, and, after a very &s;ummary form of ju&s;tice, were all put to death.</P>
<P>While Zi&s;ca was thus engaged, the em|peror was making preparations for a more formidable attempt than he had yet made. Rou&s;ed by the late &s;ucce&s;&s;es of his antago|ni&s;t, he began now to think the affair grew &s;erious; and having drawn together his whole force, and pre&s;&s;ed into his &s;ervice a body of Sile&s;ians, he entered Bohemia, on the &s;ide of Glatz; which town, with many other places, &s;ubmitted. In a few days, he arrived before Prague, and encamped with|in half a league of the city. As he had many friends in the place, he cho&s;e to make his fir&s;t effort in the way of negotiation.</P>
<P>Upon the earlie&s;t news of the emperor's march, Zi&s;ca, with an equal army, was in
<PB N="289" REF="308">
motion. He was &s;ecretly glad to hear, that Sigi&s;mond had made an attempt on Prague; not doubting but he would be obliged to wa&s;te the remaining part of the &s;ummer in a fruitle&s;s &s;iege. It was matter therefore of equal concern and a&s;toni&s;hment to him, to &s;ee from the heights, as he approached the town, the emperor's &s;tandard erected on the ca&s;tle. He was &s;oon informed, that Sigi&s;|mond had followed the example, which him&s;elf had &s;et; and, upon a good under|&s;tanding with the governor, had found the means of introducing 4000 men into that fortre&s;s, the evening before. He was in|formed too, that the Imperiali&s;ts had made an attempt upon the town that morning, and were in hopes of ma&s;tering it, before relief &s;hould arrive.</P>
<P>Zi&s;ca had now an opportunity of di&s;play|ing his great talents. Upon reflection he began to hope, that if the town only could hold out, he might yet, by an after-game, recover all. Being acquainted with every defile, and &s;pot of ground in the neighbour|hood, he harra&s;&s;ed the Imperiali&s;ts with continual alarms, beat them from their works, &s;eized every po&s;t as they de&s;erted it,
<PB N="290" REF="309">
and allowing them only a very di&s;advantage|ous field of battle, which it had been ruin to accept, obliged the whole body of them at length to retire into the ca&s;tle. He had now compleated half his work: what re|mained was as expeditiou&s;ly performed. With great art and indu&s;try he &s;o entirely blockaded the place, that the emperor in the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity, and the impracticability of a retreat.</P>
<P>Sigi&s;mond was now in great perplexity. Pent up in &s;traitened quarters, with a nume|rous garri&s;on, no magazines provided, and no pro&s;pect of relief, he had nothing before him, but famine and pe&s;tilence; or, what he dreaded as much as either, the vengeance of Zi&s;ca, who would certainly make him pay the utmo&s;t price of the advantage he had gained. Full of the&s;e racking thoughts, he put on however an air of compo&s;ed dig|nity, which no man could better a&s;&s;ume: and to divert the melancholy of tho&s;e about him, and intoxicate the imaginations of the &s;oldiery, he ordered him&s;elf to be crowned king of Bohemia. This vain piece of pageantry was performed by the archbi&s;hop of Prague, who had thrown him&s;elf under
<PB N="291" REF="310">
his protection. The marqui&s;s of Branden|burgh, the elector of Saxony, and the arch|duke of Au&s;tria, who &s;erved under Sigi&s;|mond, a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the ceremony.</P>
<P>Zi&s;ca's joy, upon this happy cri&s;is of his affairs, pa&s;&s;ed the bounds of his u&s;ual mo|deration. "Now, my friends, he would &s;ay to his officers, it is ours to give law. From this glorious day, let Bohemia boa&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hment of her liberties." In the mean time he remitted nothing of his ac|cu&s;tomed vigour. His works were carried on with unabated ardour; he vi&s;ited every po&s;t him&s;elf; and hourly expected, as the reward of his labours, that his prey would fall into his hands.</P>
<P>But Zi&s;ca's conduct, able as it was, was ineffectual. Sigi&s;mond &s;ummoned all his fortitude; and knowing he had nothing to depend on but the edge of his &s;word, in circum&s;tances, which would have added &s;trength to the feeble, he determined to ha|zard all upon one de&s;perate pu&s;h. He had the be&s;t intelligence, from his friends in the city, of all that pa&s;&s;ed in Zi&s;ca's quarters; which he &s;uddenly attacked at midnight, with all his forces, where he was well in|formed
<PB N="292" REF="311">
the po&s;t was weake&s;t. The Tabor|ites, by which name Zi&s;ca's adherents began now to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, were not &s;urprized. Each &s;ide fought, like men, who had their religion, and liberty at &s;take. The imperi|ali&s;ts in the end prevailed by mere &s;uperiority of numbers; and opened the pa&s;s, before any reinforcement could arrive.</P>
<P>The ri&s;ing &s;un di&s;covered the &s;laughter, and horrible confu&s;ion of the night; and did full credit to the bravery of the Tabor|ites, who with a handful of men had re&s;i&s;t|ed an army: and Zi&s;ca, though unfortu|nate, made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon his ene|mies, by the firmne&s;s of his troops, as was never afterwards forgotten.</P>
<P>Some authors relate, that Sigi&s;mond e&s;caped by means of a very extraordinary &s;tratagem. He got together a quantity of combu&s;tibles, in which he mixed a drug of &s;uch a nature, that when fired, it emitted a mo&s;t pe&s;tilential &s;tench. The &s;moke of this, &s;ay the&s;e writers, being driven in the faces of the enemy, occa&s;ioned them imme|diately to abandon their po&s;t. This impro|bable tale &s;eems to have ari&s;en, from the emperor's making his attack under the cover
<PB N="293" REF="312">
of &s;moke; or invented from a belief, that Zi&s;ca could not be conquered by any ordi|nary means.</P>
<P>The po&s;t, which the imperiali&s;ts had thus forced, was not far from the camp of the Taborites, which was the head quarters of Zi&s;ca. Prompted by his &s;ucce&s;s, the em|peror came to a &s;peedy re&s;olution, at day|break, to endeavour to force this likewi&s;e. Not &s;atisfied with an e&s;cape, he now &s;trove for ma&s;tery; and encouraging his men &s;till covered with du&s;t, and blood, he led them to the a&s;cent, on which Zi&s;ca lay encamped. "Yonder, cryed he, lye your provi&s;ions." The hungry veteran pre&s;&s;ed on; the camp, thinned by numerous out-po&s;ts, was in&s;tant|ly entered; and the Taborites could only die in its defence. As we are not informed that Zi&s;ca was in the action, it is probable he was in &s;ome other quarter at the time of the attack.</P>
<P>This was a cruel &s;troke upon him. His hopes were now entirely bla&s;ted. A favour|able opportunity had been wre&s;ted from him; his camp had been de&s;troyed, and his bag|gage plundered. But the&s;e were trivial lo&s;&s;es. Another opportunity might offer; his tents
<PB N="294" REF="313">
and baggage might ea&s;ily be replaced. But the lo&s;s of his credit in arms he dreaded as an irreparable lo&s;s. His being thought in|vincible, he well knew, could only &s;upport his cau&s;e; and he had &s;ufficient rea&s;on to fear, that if his troops e&s;teemed him le&s;s the favourite of heaven, than they had hitherto done, they would in&s;tantly de&s;ert.&mdash; The&s;e were the mortifying reflections, which accompanied his retreat.</P>
<P>In the mean time Sigi&s;mond made the utmo&s;t of his advantage. The principal of Zi&s;ca's po&s;ts he &s;eized; and returning to his old enterprize, he blocked up the city. Here divi&s;ion reigned. The emperor's party was &s;trong; but Zi&s;ca's prevailed to keep the gates &s;hut: and &s;uch was the extreme di&s;|order of the place, and the rancour, which appeared on both &s;ides, that &s;ober men had ju&s;t grounds to fear the wor&s;t from the &s;uc|ce&s;s of either.</P>
<P>While Sigi&s;mond was thus engaged in the &s;iege of Prague, Zi&s;ca was employed in re|cruiting his army; in which he had better &s;ucce&s;s than he expected. The &s;pirit of his adherents was of too high a temper to be cooled by one &s;ini&s;ter event. The quarrel
<PB N="295" REF="314">
was important. Their intere&s;ts were deeply embarked; and there was no rea&s;on yet to give up all for lo&s;t. They fully confided in their general; and &s;eemed to make it a point to &s;hew that confidence by their activity in rai&s;ing troops. So that in fact before Zi&s;ca could feel his lo&s;s, it was repaired.</P>
<P>Sigi&s;mond had now lain &s;ix weeks before Prague, harra&s;&s;ed daily by the army of Zi&s;ca, which &s;eemed to have recovered fre&s;h &s;pirits from its defeat. The po&s;ts of the imperial|i&s;ts were attacked; their foraging &s;traitened; and their provi&s;ions cut off. Once Sigi&s;mond had the mortification to &s;ee a con&s;iderable part of his troops defeated, and very roughly handled. His &s;upplies too from Germany came in more lei&s;urely than he expected. The&s;e things abated greatly that eagerne&s;s, with which he began his de&s;ign. But an event &s;oon afterwards totally di&s;couraged him.</P>
<P>Near Prague &s;tood a craggy hill, which Zi&s;ca, thinking it a po&s;t of advantage, had &s;eized; and fortifyed. From this eminence he greatly annoyed the emperor; &s;o that Sigi&s;mond at length found, he mu&s;t either give up all hopes of taking the city, or make
<PB N="296" REF="315">
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of this po&s;t. His efforts were ineffectual: the po&s;t was &s;tronger than he &s;uppo&s;ed, when he attempted force; better guarded, when he attempted &s;urprize. One effort more he was determined to make. With this view he &s;ent the marqui&s;s of Mi&s;nia with a large body of men, &s;ufficient, as he thought, to force it. The marqui&s;s met with little to oppo&s;e him in his march. The Taborites. except a few cautious &s;kir|mi&s;hers, lay clo&s;e in their Trenches. The Imperiali&s;ts, misjudging this the effect of fear, a&s;cended with the more pre&s;umption. They now approached the craggy part of the top, overcome with toil; when on a &s;udden the Taborites leaping out, with loud &s;houts, from every part of the intrenchments, fell on them with all the fury of impatient ar|dour. Amazement checked the Imperiali&s;ts, and the fir&s;t &s;hock obliged them to give ground. They would have retreated, but their able adver&s;ary had made &s;ure work,&mdash; their retreat was intercepted. They had only to chu&s;e the manner of their death. On one hand were the &s;words of an enraged foe; on the other a precipice. The whole affair was in&s;tantly decided; and before mercy
<PB N="297" REF="316">
could take place, &s;carce an object of mercy remained. The marqui&s;s him&s;elf, with a few of his followers, e&s;caped.</P>
<P>This terrible di&s;a&s;ter, by which the em|peror lo&s;t near one third of his army, re|duced him to the nece&s;&s;ity of rai&s;ing the &s;iege. He gave all nece&s;&s;ary orders by &s;un|&s;et; and, at the clo&s;e of the evening, drew off his troops in &s;ilence, without drum or trumpet, accompanied with all tho&s;e &s;igns of mute dejection, and terrors of alarm, which commonly attend di&s;graced armies. Zi&s;ca pur&s;ued his rear; but with little advan|tage, the emperor conducting his retreat in a very ma&s;terly manner.</P>
<P>Thus ended this momentous affair; in which great military &s;kill, and great courage had been &s;hewn on both &s;ides. So equal indeed the contention had been, that it is hard to &s;ay, whether Sigi&s;mond de&s;erved more prai&s;e by obliging Zi&s;ca to rai&s;e the &s;iege of the ca&s;tle; or Zi&s;ca by obliging him to rai&s;e the &s;iege of the town. Undi&s;tin|gui&s;hing fame however blew her trumpet over the banners of the &s;ucce&s;sful hero; and gave Zi&s;ca that full glory, which his noble adver&s;ary &s;hould have divided with him.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="317">Such was the fir&s;t &s;ummer of the war; in which Zi&s;ca &s;ufficiently tried his &s;trength, and found the courage of his men propor|tioned to any &s;ervice. He had the &s;atisfaction likewi&s;e of finding him&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding his many lo&s;&s;es, at the head of a greater army when he clo&s;ed, than when he opened the campaign.</P>
<P>Early in the &s;pring, of the next year, 1421. Zi&s;ca took the field; and began this campaign, as he had begun the la&s;t, by de|&s;troying all the mona&s;teries, which he met with in his march. His de&s;ign was upon the ca&s;tle of Wi&s;grade, a &s;trong fortre&s;s near Prague, where Sigi&s;mond had placed a nu|merous garri&s;on. He endeavoured fir&s;t to take it by &s;torm; but lo&s;ing many men in the attempt, and &s;eeing little likelihood of &s;ucceeding in that way, he turned the &s;iege into a blockade. The magazines of the be|&s;ieged growing &s;canty, and their very hor&s;es being now con&s;umed, they began to think of a capitulation; and propo&s;ed to deliver up the ca&s;tle within &s;uch a time, if the em|peror did not relieve it. The condition was accepted, and the time being nearly elap&s;ed, Zi&s;ca had intelligence, that Sigi&s;mond was
<PB N="299" REF="318">
approaching with his army. He put him&s;elf immediately in a po&s;ture to receive him; and &s;ent advice of his march to Prague. The Taborite party there in&s;tantly taking arms, po&s;ted them&s;elves according to Zi&s;ca's di|rection, in &s;ome defiles, through which the Imperiali&s;ts were obliged to pa&s;s. Sigi&s;mond, not expecting ho&s;tilities from that quarter, and having his eye fixed on Zi&s;ca, fell into the &s;nare. It was a ma&s;&s;acre, rather than a battle; and the emperor e&s;caped with a re|mainder of his army, only becau&s;e his ene|mier were too much fatigued to urge the &s;laughter farther. The &s;everity of this action fell chiefly upon the Hungarian, and Mora|vian troops; who&s;e officers, the prime no|bility of their re&s;pective countries, di&s;tin|gui&s;hing them&s;elves with great &s;pirit, if any di&s;tinction could be made in &s;uch confu&s;ion, were almo&s;t entirely cut off. Some writers give the credit of this action to Zi&s;ca in per|&s;on. He retreated, we are told, at the em|peror's approach; and in the &s;ecurity of the night returning, attacked his camp with &s;uch fury, as &s;oon ended the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>The emperor, thus maimed, was in no condition to keep his appointment with the
<PB N="300" REF="319">
ca&s;tle of Wi&s;grade; which immediately &s;ur|rendered upon the news of his defeat. This was the mo&s;t valuable acqui&s;ition which Zi&s;ca had made, no garri&s;on in tho&s;e parts holding a larger territory in devotion.</P>
<P>Zi&s;ca was now at lei&s;ure to attend a little to the work of reformation; a work which he had exceedingly at heart. For him&s;elf, tho' he was more a &s;oldier than a divine; yet he had in general an utter dete&s;tation of the &s;upremacy of the court of Rome, and a high e&s;teem for the memory of Hu&s;s. What he aimed at therefore was to give a form, and &s;ettlement, to the opinions of that reformer. With this view he con&s;ulted tho&s;e e&s;pecially, for whom he knew Hu&s;s had ever had the highe&s;t regard; and &s;hewed he could, on this occa&s;ion, exert as much pru|dent caution, as on other occa&s;ions he had exerted vigour, and activity.</P>
<P>While Zi&s;ca was thus employed in e&s;ta|bli&s;hing a church, like the Jews in Ezra's time, he kept his &s;word continually drawn. Sigi&s;mond, tho' he dur&s;t not fairly meet him, would harra&s;s him with con&s;tant alarms. Nor was Zi&s;ca, in his heart, di&s;plea&s;ed at the&s;e frequent vi&s;its. <Q>It is friendly, &s;aid
<PB N="301" REF="320">
he, in the emperor, to keep our &s;words from ru&s;ting in their &s;cabbards.</Q></P>
<P>Indeed Zi&s;ca had le&s;s to fear from the enemy than from inaction. Danger was the great central force, which drew men to him; and his authority ro&s;e in proportion to the fears of the multitude. Of cour&s;e, he dreaded no artifice like a fal&s;e peace. He well knew how ea&s;ily the minds of the peo|ple were deluded; and he wanted tho&s;e ne|ce&s;&s;ary means of keeping a body of men together, which his adver&s;ary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; a military law, and a military che&s;t. Mere native authority &s;tood in lieu of both.</P>
<P>He had an evil too of another kind to contend with. The Bohemian clergy were in general, beyond conception, ignorant: and too many of tho&s;e, who came over to the reformed opinions, brought nothing with them, in &s;upport of the new cau&s;e they had adopted, but an inflamed zeal again&s;t the pope, and the emperor. Not a few of the&s;e bigots followed the camp of Zi&s;ca; and having great influence upon the people, which they were forward, on all occa&s;ions, to &s;hew, they frequently interfered with his &s;chemes, and oppo&s;ed his mea&s;ures. A
<PB N="302" REF="321">
fe&s;tival, or a fa&s;t-day, was improper for action; the ea&s;t-&s;ide of a town was never to be attacked; an encampment was to be formed, and an army drawn up, as nearly as could be, in the form of a cro&s;s. The&s;e were, in general, points not only of moment, but of indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Indeed Zi&s;ca had never more occa&s;ion for his addre&s;s, nor, upon any occa&s;ion, more &s;hewed it, than in the management of the&s;e mi&s;guided zealots. In trifles he conformed, with great deference, to their humours, that he might with a better grace remon&s;trate in matters of importance. The influence how|ever which he had from the fir&s;t over the &s;oldiery, &s;ettled by degrees into a confirmed authority; and in proportion as more weight was thrown into his &s;cale, the other a&s;cend|ed. The clergy had be&s;ides made them&s;elves &s;o contemptible in many in&s;tances, that even the common &s;oldiers began to detect their folly. Hi&s;tory takes notice of a ridiculous accident, which contributed not a little to de&s;troy their credit. They had expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;like to a piece of ground, where Zi&s;ca lay encamped; and with great haugh|tine&s;s had ordered the intrenchments to be
<PB N="303" REF="322">
razed. Zi&s;ca, unwilling to relinqui&s;h a &s;itu|ation, which was very advantageous, with equal firmne&s;s per&s;evered. But he was given to under&s;tand, that all remon&s;trance was to no purpo&s;e; &mdash; that fire would certainly the next day de&s;cend from heaven upon that accur&s;ed &s;pot; &mdash; and that he mu&s;t in&s;tantly decamp, unle&s;s he cho&s;e to &s;ee his men burnt alive before his face. This dreadful pre|diction of divine wrath &s;pread an alarm through the camp, which Zi&s;ca had not in|fluence to with&s;tand: the &s;oldiers &s;carce wait|ed for orders: the tents were in&s;tantly torn up, and the ground entirely de&s;erted. In the morning, when every one expected to &s;ee the devoted &s;pot overwhelmed with a tempe&s;t of fire, &s;uch a deluge of rain fell, as if &s;ent on purpo&s;e to turn the prophecy into ridicule. The troops were a&s;hamed of their folly in li&s;tening to &s;uch teachers; and it became a common je&s;t in the army, that the prophecies of their clergy, and the com|pletion, were as oppo&s;ite to each other, as fire and water. &mdash; In the infancy however of his affairs, the&s;e people had given great di&s;|turbance to Zi&s;ca; who&s;e u&s;ual method was, when he ob&s;erved any &s;ymptoms of unea&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="304" REF="323">
in his camp, to &s;pread alarms and draw his men into action. He thought it impru|dent to &s;uffer the quarrel to langui&s;h, till the full e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace; and when the enemy did not find him employment, he found it for him&s;elf; making expeditions into the country, and de&s;troying the ca&s;tles, and &s;trong holds, wherever he became ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e expeditions almo&s;t proved fatal to him. He was incamped before the town of Rubi, which he had almo&s;t reduced to extremities. As he was viewing a part of the works, where he intended an a&s;&s;ault, an arrow, &s;hot from the wall, &s;truck him in the eye. The wound being thought dan|gerous, the &s;urgeons of the army propo&s;ed his being carried to Prague, where he might have the be&s;t advice. In reality they were afraid of being cut to pieces by the troops, if he &s;hould die under their hands. When his removal to the capital was re&s;olved on, it was difficult to check the conte&s;t among the &s;oldiers, who &s;trove for the honour of carry|ing their wounded general. At Prague the arrow was extracted; which being barbed, tore out the eye with it; and it was feared,
<PB N="305" REF="324">
the fever which &s;ucceeded, might prove fatal to him. His life however, though with difficulty, was &s;aved.</P>
<P>He was now totally blind: his friends therefore were &s;urprized to hear him talk of &s;etting out for the army; and did what was in their power to di&s;&s;uade him from it. But he continued re&s;olute: <Q>I have yet, &s;aid he, my blood to &s;hed; let me be gone.</Q> He &s;uffered him&s;elf however to undergo the affected formality of being intreated by a deputation from the army; and enjoyed the plea&s;ure of hearing the &s;oldiers, in tumults around his quarters, cry aloud, "They would throw down their arms, unle&s;s their general were re&s;tored."</P>
<P>In the mean time Sigi&s;mond had lain quiet: at lea&s;t his army, &s;ince its defeat before Wi&s;grade, had appeared in no &s;hape in Bohemia, but in that of &s;couting parties. This calm in the emperor's quarters was only that lowring &s;tillne&s;s, which is the prelude of a &s;torm. Sigi&s;mond had been making preparations during the &s;ummer. At Nu|remburgh he convened the &s;tates of the em|pire. Here, in full convention, (for, it &s;eems, no prince except the elector of Treves
<PB N="306" REF="325">
was ab&s;ent,) he opened to them his embar|ra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances; and intreated them for the &s;ake of their &s;overeign, for the hon|our of the empire, and in the cau&s;e of their religion, to put them&s;elves in arms. His harangue had its effect. Proper mea&s;ures were concerted; and the a&s;&s;embly broke up, with a unanimous re&s;olution to make this audacious rebel feel the full weight of the empire: and that the blow might fall the more unexpected, it was re&s;olved to defer it till the end of the year; when, it was hoped, that Zi&s;ca might the more ea&s;ily be &s;urprized, as great part of his troops left him in the winter, and returned again in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>The campaign, as that chief imagined, was now over, when he was &s;uddenly alarmed with the report of the&s;e va&s;t preparations; and &s;oon after with the march of two powerful armies again&s;t him; one of which was compo&s;ed of confederate Germans, under the marqui&s;s of Brandenburgh, the archbi&s;hop of Mentz, the count-palatine of the Rhine, and other princes of the empire; the other of Hungarians and Sile&s;ians, under the emperor him&s;elf. The former were to invade Bohemia on the we&s;t; the latter on
<PB N="307" REF="326">
the ea&s;t. They were to meet in the mid|dle; and, as they affected to give out, would cru&s;h this handful of vexatious &s;ectaries be|tween them. At the head of &s;uch a force, the emperor could not avoid being &s;anguine.</P>
<P>They, who are acquainted with the nature of armies intended to march in concert, know the difficulty of making &s;uch unweildy bo|dies ob&s;erve tho&s;e exact laws of motion, which prudent generals trace out in councils of war. Some unfore&s;een event generally creates &s;ome unavoidable difficulty.</P>
<P>It happened thus on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. Sigi&s;mond, di&s;appointed in a contract for forage, was obliged to defer his march. He was retarded too by the Au&s;trian and Hun|garian nobility, who entring as volunteers into his &s;ervice, and being &s;uddenly called upon, had not gotten their equipages and dependants, without which their dignity could not take the field, in &s;uch readine&s;s as it was thought they might have had them.</P>
<P>The confederate princes, in the mean time, began their march; and were already advanced a con&s;iderable way into Bohemia, before they heard of the emperor's di&s;ap|pointment. Sigi&s;mond gave them hopes,
<PB N="308" REF="327">
that he would pre&s;ently join them; and ad|vi&s;ed them to form the &s;iege of Soi&s;in. They intrenched them&s;elves accordingly, and began an attack, for which they were not in the be&s;t manner provided, again&s;t what was then e&s;teemed one of the &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;&s;es in Bohemia. The be&s;ieged laughed at their vain efforts, and kept their u&s;ual guard; while wet trenches, a hungry camp, the &s;evereties of an inclement winter, and above all, the emperor's delay, introduced mutiny into the tents of the be&s;iegers, and di&s;&s;ention into their councils.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation were they, ready to catch any alarm, when Zi&s;ca approached with his army. The very &s;ight of his banners float|ing at a di&s;tance, was &s;ufficient. They &s;truck their tents, and retreated with precipitation; burning the country as they fled; and cur&s;ing the emperor's breach of faith.</P>
<P>About the end of December, a full month after his appointed time, the emperor began his march. As he entered Bohemia, he re|ceived the fir&s;t account of the retreat of the confederates; yet he determined to proceed. He was at the head of a gallant army, the flower of which were 15,000 Hungarian
<PB N="309" REF="328">
hor&s;e, e&s;teemed, at that time, the be&s;t cavalry in Europe, led by a Florentine officer of great experience. The infantry, which con|&s;i&s;ted of 25,000 men, were provided, as well as the cavalry, with every thing proper for a winter's campaign.</P>
<P>This army &s;pread terror through all the ea&s;t of Bohemia; Zi&s;ca being &s;till in the we&s;t pur&s;uing the Germans. Wherever Sigi&s;mond marched, the magi&s;trates laid their keys at his feet; and were treated with &s;eve|rity, or favour, according to their merits in his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>His career however was pre&s;ently checked. Zi&s;ca with &s;peedy marches approached; and threw a damp upon him in the mid&s;t of his &s;ucce&s;s. He cho&s;e his ground however as well as he was able; and re&s;olved to try his fortune, once more, with that invincible chief.</P>
<P>No general paid le&s;s regard to the circum|&s;tances of time and place than Zi&s;ca. He &s;eldom de&s;ired more than to come up with his adver&s;ary: the enthu&s;ia&s;tic fury of his &s;oldiers &s;upplied the re&s;t. There was not a man in his army, who did not meet his ene|my with that &s;ame invincible &s;pirit, with
<PB N="310" REF="329">
which the martyr meets death; who did not in a manner pre&s;s to be the foremo&s;t in that glorious band of heroes, whom the Almighty &s;hould de&s;tine to the noble act of dying for their religion.&mdash;Such were the troops, which the ill-fate of Sigi&s;mond brought him now to encounter.</P>
<P>On the 13th of January, 1422, the two armies met, on a &s;pacious plain, near Kam|nitz. Zi&s;ca appeared in the centre of his front line; guarded, or rather conducted by a hor&s;eman on each &s;ide, armed with a poll|ax. His troops having &s;ung an hymn, with a determined coolne&s;s drew their &s;words, and waited for the &s;ignal.</P>
<P>Zi&s;ca &s;tood not long in view of the ene|my. When his officers had informed him, that the ranks were all well clo&s;ed, he waved his &s;abre round his head, which was the &s;ign of battle.</P>
<P>Hi&s;torians &s;peak of the on&s;et of Zi&s;ca's troops, as a &s;hock beyond credibility; and it appears to have been &s;uch on this occa&s;ion. The imperial infantry hardly made a &s;tand. In the &s;pace of a few minutes they were di&s;ordered beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of being ral|lied. The cavalry made a feeble effort; but
<PB N="311" REF="330">
&s;eeing them&s;elves un&s;upported, they wheeled round, and fled upon the &s;pur.&mdash;Thus &s;ud|denly was the extent of the plain, as far as the eye could reach, &s;pread with di&s;order; the pur&s;uers and the pur&s;ued mixed together, the whole one indi&s;tinct ma&s;s of moving con|fu&s;ion. Here and there might be &s;een, in|ter&s;per&s;ed, a few parties endeavouring to unite; but they were broken as &s;oon as formed.</P>
<P>The routed army fled towards the con+fines of Moravia; the Taborites, with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> intermi&s;&s;ion, galling their rear. The river Igla, which was then frozen, oppo&s;ed their flight. Here new di&s;a&s;ters befel them. The bridge being immediately choked, and the enemy pre&s;&s;ing furiou&s;ly on, many of the infantry, and in a manner the whole body of the cavalry, attempted the river. The ice gave way; and not fewer than 2000 were &s;wallowed up in the water.</P>
<P>Here Zi&s;ca &s;heathed his &s;word, which had been &s;ufficiently glutted with blood; and returned in triumph to Tabor, laden with all the &s;poils, and all the trophies, which the mo&s;t compleat victory could give.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="331">The battle of Kamnitz having put Zi&s;ca in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole kingdom of Bohemia, he had now lei&s;ure to pay a little more attention to his de&s;igned e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a church.</P>
<P>He began now to aboli&s;h, in all places, the ceremonies of the popi&s;h wor&s;hip. Prayers for the dead, images, holy-water, auricular confe&s;&s;ion, holy-oil, &s;acerdotal ve&s;t|ments, fa&s;ts, and fe&s;tivals, all the&s;e things he totally forbad. The pope's name he ra&s;ed out of all public in&s;truments; and denied his &s;upremacy. Merit alone, he &s;aid, &s;hould give di&s;tinction among the prie&s;ts of Bohe|mia; and they &s;hould gain the reverence of the people by the &s;anctity of their lives, not by their luxurious manner of living. Church|yards were forbidden al&s;o; as they had been brought into u&s;e, he thought, only to enrich the clergy. Purgatory too was expunged from the articles of belief.</P>
<P>From the&s;e things we may judge how much farther Hu&s;s would, in all probability, have carried reformation; if he had had it in his power: for we may con&s;ider Zi&s;ca, as acting by his authority, and doing nothing,
<PB N="313" REF="332">
but what was con&s;onant to his expre&s;s doc|trine; or might by fair inference be deduced from it.</P>
<P>We have no grounds to &s;uppo&s;e this mili|tary reformer had any bigotry in his temper: he &s;eems not to have &s;hewn any inclination to force the con&s;ciences of any differing &s;ect; but to have left men at liberty to like or di&s;|like, to unite with him, or leave him, as they thought be&s;t. Nor was he by any means arbitrary in his impo&s;itions; but con|&s;ulted his friends, and fixed on nothing, but what found at lea&s;t a general concurrence.&mdash; He had the misfortune, notwith&s;tanding this moderation, to give great offence to many of the Bohemian reformers.</P>
<P>A variety of &s;ects is the natural con&s;e|quence of religious liberty; and mutual ani|mo&s;ity is too often the con&s;equence of a variety of &s;ects. The mi&s;chief is not, that men think differently, which is unavoidable; it is, their refu&s;ing others, that liberty, which they take them&s;elves. To re&s;train therefore the bad effects of bigotry, the pru|dent legi&s;lator protects an e&s;tabli&s;hment; and whatever toleration he may allow to &s;ecta|ries, (and the wi&s;e&s;t hath generally allowed
<PB N="314" REF="333">
the mo&s;t,) he will however keep &s;uch a re|&s;traint upon them, as may pre&s;erve the tran|quility of the whole.</P>
<P>Among the &s;everal &s;ects, for there were &s;everal, which the reformation produced in Bohemia, one only was able to di&s;pute the point of &s;uperiority with the Taborites. It was that of the Calixtins, &s;o called from the word <HI>calix,</HI> a cup. They admini&s;tred the Lord's &s;upper in both kinds; but in other points receded le&s;s from the church of Rome, than any other Bohemian reformers.</P>
<P>The &s;eeds of animo&s;ity had long been &s;own between this &s;ect, and the Taborites; but each was re&s;trained by its fears of ex|ternal danger. When an appearance of greater tranquillity &s;ucceeded; and Zi&s;ca, taking the opportunity, began to innovate, and form the &s;cheme of an e&s;tabli&s;hment, he &s;oon found how warm an oppo&s;ition he was likely to meet with from the Calixtins, who&s;e party was by no means contemptible. The&s;e &s;ectaries, who were chiefly confined to Prague, and its di&s;trict, (and being the more embodied, could act with the greater force,) were highly offended at being le&s;s taken notice of, than &s;o con&s;iderable a party,
<PB N="315" REF="334">
in their own eyes, &s;hould have been. Their clamour &s;oon began, and in language &s;uffi|ciently warm: <Q>Here, &s;aid they, is a re|formation indeed! in&s;tead of weeding and pruning the Lord's vineyard, as ought to have been done, the fence is totally taken away, and the wild boar of the wood is &s;uffered to root it up. The church of Rome, however culpable in many re&s;|pects, is at lea&s;t decent in its wor&s;hip: but the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of reformation hath not even decency to boa&s;t of.</Q> &mdash; From violent language, they proceeded, in the u&s;ual progre&s;&s;ion, to violent actions.</P>
<P>John the Premon&s;traten&s;ian, (&s;o called from an order of monkery, in which he had &s;pent a novitiate,) was the principal abettor of the Taborite party in Prague. He was a man of family, fortune, and character; all which con&s;pired to give him influence. This per&s;on, con&s;idering Zi&s;ca, during the pre&s;ent un&s;ettled &s;tate of Bohemia, as the leader, from whom he was properly to look for in&s;tructions, employed his whole intere&s;t in favour of that chief; and endeavoured to introduce the &s;ame regulations at Prague,
<PB N="316" REF="335">
which Zi&s;ca had e&s;tabli&s;hed in other parts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>The principal magi&s;trates of Prague were Calixtins; and unhappily men of little tem|per. It doth not appear, that John had di&s;|covered any unbecoming zeal; yet he &s;oon found, that he had given great offence; and had &s;ufficient rea&s;on to fear, that if he brought him&s;elf within the &s;hadow of a law, that law would be made to cru&s;h him.</P>
<P>Late one evening, he and nine others, all chiefs of the Taborite party, were &s;ent for, by the magi&s;trates, to the council-chamber, upon a pretence of &s;ettling &s;omething with regard to public peace. They came without &s;cruple; but found, on their entrance, an a&s;&s;embly, which they little expected; &mdash; a court &s;itting in form; before which they were immediately arraigned. The chief magi&s;trate, without further ceremony, ac|quainted them, that in all &s;tates it had been the practice, upon emergent occa&s;ions, to di&s;pen&s;e with the formalities of law; &mdash; that their behaviour had been &s;uch, as very great|ly endangered the tranquillity of the city; &mdash; that &s;ufficient matter for the mo&s;t public trial
<PB N="317" REF="336">
could be brought again&s;t them;&mdash;but that it was rather cho&s;en, for the &s;ake of peace, to proceed again&s;t them in this more private way.</P>
<P>Vain were all remon&s;trances again&s;t the&s;e lawle&s;s proceedings: witne&s;&s;es were imme|diately called; and, the facts alledged being proved, &s;entence of death was ha&s;tily pa&s;&s;ed upon them; and they were as ha&s;tily hurried into an inner court of the building; where, without any of the u&s;ual circum&s;tances of decency, they were put to death.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;o horrid a ma&s;&s;a|cre, however privately tran&s;acted, &s;hould e&s;cape the public knowledge. By noon the next day it was known in all parts of the city. Some authors mention its being di&s;|covered in a very extraordinary manner. The blood, which ran in &s;treams from the headle&s;s trunks of the&s;e unfortunate men, having been forgotten in the confu&s;ion of the action, made its way through the drains into the &s;treet, and plainly di&s;covered the horrid deed. The populace, by what|ever means acquainted with the affair, were immediately in an uproar: all parties were &s;candalized: even the Calixtins were too
<PB N="318" REF="337">
much confounded to make re&s;i&s;tance; while the Taborites took an ample revenge. They were not now actuated by tho&s;e mild virtues, which Hu&s;s had di&s;covered on a like occa|&s;ion. The &s;pirit of the times was changed. They a&s;&s;embled with loud clamours before the hou&s;es of the magi&s;trates; forced open the doors; dragged them from their con|cealments; and haled them into the &s;treets; where, having expo&s;ed them as &s;pectacles, and reproached them with their crimes, they put them to a cruel death.</P>
<P>When the tumult of this affair was over, and men began to think coolly upon the matter, the Calixtins plainly &s;aw how much injury their cau&s;e had &s;uffered. It was true, that outrages had been committed on both &s;ides. But the &s;cale was by no means equal. The world would certainly be mo&s;t forward to condemn the aggre&s;&s;or; and a manife&s;t di&s;tinction would be made between an act of magi&s;tracy, and an act of mere popular &s;ury. They concluded therefore, that the breach between them and the Taborites was irre|parable; and that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to live happily under any government, in which Zi&s;ca pre&s;ided.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="338">The&s;e were the &s;entiments of the &s;enate of Prague; in which a&s;&s;embly, after long deliberation, it was re&s;olved to &s;end deputies to the grand duke of Lithuania, and to offer him, in the name of the capital of Bohemia, the crown of that kingdom. The duke accepted their offer; and immediately &s;ent troops to &s;upport his title.</P>
<P>This fatal di&s;&s;ention was looked upon as the expiring pang of the liberties of Bohe|mia. It was not doubted but the emperor would &s;eize this favourable opportunity; and, having &s;uffered the two parties tho|roughly to weaken them&s;elves, would &s;ud|denly cru&s;h them both. It happened other|wi&s;e. Animated as the&s;e &s;ectaries were again&s;t each other, they were &s;till more &s;o again&s;t the common enemy. Zi&s;ca indeed &s;atisfied him&s;elf with prote&s;ting again&s;t the re&s;olutions of the &s;enate of Prague; and, bearing, with his accu&s;tomed firmne&s;s, the ingratitude of his country, lay quiet in his camp at Tabor: while the Calixtins, in concert with the Lithuanians, &s;eeing them|&s;elves unmole&s;ted by him, began immedi|ately to act again&s;t the emperor.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="339">This party affected now to take the lead in all public affairs. But their &s;ucce&s;s was not an&s;werable to their pre&s;umption. The fir&s;t enterprize they attempted was the &s;iege of Charles-&s;tone, a fortifyed po&s;t, where the emperor had found an opportunity to intro|duce a garri&s;on of 400 men. Before this place, which was by no means con&s;iderable, they con&s;umed full &s;ix months; and at length gave up the affair. The garri&s;on, during the whole &s;iege, held them in the utmo&s;t contempt. Having taken &s;ome pri|&s;oners, in a &s;ally, they hung one of them over the wall, where the a&s;&s;ault was fierce&s;t, with a fly-flapper in his hand, intimating, that this was &s;ufficient to baffle the utmo&s;t efforts of the be&s;iegers. Zi&s;ca, in the mean time, &s;at by, a calm &s;pectator of what pa&s;&s;ed. There were &s;ome di&s;tempers, which, he thought, be&s;t cured them&s;elves; and he con&s;idered this di&s;order as one of them. He knew the Calixtins had among them no leader of any capacity, in military affairs e&s;pecially; and he doubted not but they would &s;oon feel the bad effects of ill-con|certed mea&s;ures.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="340">Indeed the Calixtins were not a little chagrined at the di&s;grace they had &s;uffered before Charles-&s;tone. The &s;ucce&s;s of the invincible Zi&s;ca, from who&s;e au&s;pices they had now withdrawn them&s;elves, was, on this occa&s;ion, an unplea&s;ing retro&s;pect: but they had &s;oon &s;everer cau&s;e for reflection.</P>
<P>On the frontiers of Hungary Sigi&s;mond had a conference with the king of Poland; the &s;ubject of which was the ill-u&s;age he had received from the duke of Lithuania. Sigi&s;|mond pu&s;hed the affair with &s;o much force of argument, and in&s;inuating addre&s;s, that upon a proper application from his &s;overeign, the duke gave up his title to the crown of Bohemia, and withdrew his forces. It is probable he had now lei&s;ure to &s;ee things in a different light; and could di&s;cern more thorns than flowers &s;cattered in the path-way to a throne; which he had not before ob|&s;erved, while dazzled with the glare of royalty. The Calixtins thus deprived of foreign aid, immediately &s;unk into their for|mer in&s;ignificance. They became the ob|jects al&s;o of that contempt, of which the world is commonly &s;o liberal upon the baffled &s;chemes of imprudence, and folly.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="341">Zi&s;ca, in the mean time, was in full cre|dit with his party, and was earne&s;tly reque&s;t|ed to a&s;&s;ume the crown of Bohemia him&s;elf, as a reparation for the in&s;ult he had received. No one in the kingdom, they a&s;&s;ured him, had the power, if he had the inclination, to make the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition; and as for the emperor, they hoped he would &s;oon be in|duced to drop his claim. But Zi&s;ca, whom even his enemies neither tax with avarice, nor ambition, &s;teadily refu&s;ed. <Q>While you find me of &s;ervice to your de&s;igns, &s;aid the di&s;intere&s;ted chief, you may freely command both my coun&s;els, and my &s;word; but I will never accept any e&s;ta|bli&s;hed authority. On the contrary, my mo&s;t earne&s;t advice to you is, when the perver&s;ene&s;s of our enemies &s;hall allow us peace, to tru&s;t your&s;elves no longer in the hands of kings; but to form your&s;elves into a republic; which &s;pecies of govern|ment only can &s;ecure your liberties.</Q></P>
<P>It was near Chri&s;tmas 1422, when the Lithuanian army evacuated Bohemia. Sigi&s;|mond was &s;olicitous to have this impediment removed before the &s;pring, when he pro|po&s;ed to open a very active campaign. He
<PB N="323" REF="342">
had made, as u&s;ual, great preparations; and intended once more to enter Bohemia with two &s;eparate armies. With this view, he &s;et the marqui&s;s of Mi&s;nia at the head of a con&s;iderable body of Saxons, which were to penetrate by the way of Upper Saxony; while him&s;elf, at the head of another army, &s;hould enter Moravia, on the &s;ide of Hun|gary. His de&s;ign was, when he had over|run that country, which, upon the matter, was wholly in the intere&s;t of Zi&s;ca, to join the marqui&s;s in the centre of Bohemia. This was Sigi&s;mond's la&s;t effort; upon which he had exhau&s;ted his whole &s;trength. It is &s;urprizing indeed, how he had thus far found re&s;ources in this ruinous and de&s;tructive war; con&s;idering him already in &s;ome degree im|poveri&s;hed by an expen&s;ive expedition again&s;t the Turks. But the amiable Sigi&s;mond could do what the authority of the emperor could not have done. So in&s;inuating were his manners, &s;o gentle and affable his beha|viour, that he won the hearts of men, and drew them as he plea&s;ed. Had not religion oppo&s;ed, nothing could have with&s;tood the claim of this accompli&s;hed prince to the crown of Bohemia.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="343">On the other &s;ide, Zi&s;ca was not back|ward in his preparations. He had &s;ome time before &s;ent Procop, an excellent young offi|cer, to command in Moravia; in whom he had entire confidence, and to who&s;e ma|nagement he wholly intru&s;ted the military affairs of that country; recommending to him particularly a cautious behaviour, and mea&s;ures merely defen&s;ive.</P>
<P>Procop was a citizen of Prague, of ordi|nary parentage; but his &s;prightline&s;s and beauty recommending him in his childhood to an affluent family, he had been adopted into it. His new father &s;pared no expence in his education; and having given him the be&s;t, which his own country afforded, &s;ent him to travel into Spain, Italy, and other parts of Europe. After a con&s;iderable &s;tay abroad, he returned home, a very accom|pli&s;hed per&s;on. The religious war &s;oon after breaking out, he attached him&s;elf, as his inclination led him, to the fortunes of Zi&s;ca, under whom, he not only expected to learn the rudiments of war, his favourite &s;tudy; but re&s;olved to practi&s;e them likewi&s;e, in the &s;ervice of his country. From the moment he entered a camp, he gave him&s;elf up en|tirely
<PB N="325" REF="344">
to his profe&s;&s;ion; in the knowledge of which he made a rapid progre&s;s. Zi&s;ca &s;oon di&s;covered the uncommon talents of his young pupil; employed him frequently in matters, which required courage and punctu|ality; and, at an age when men &s;eldom ar|rive at the command of a regiment, &s;et him over a province. His abilities indeed were &s;uch, that Zi&s;ca was in little pain about Mo|ravia; at lea&s;t he hoped, that Procop would be able to keep the emperor employed, till he him&s;elf &s;hould return from the frontiers of Saxony; whither he marched, with all his force, upon the fir&s;t notice of the ene|my's preparations.</P>
<P>The marqui&s;s had not yet taken the field. Zi&s;ca, to &s;trike a terror into his troops, ra|vaged his borders; and boldly, in the face of his army, &s;at down before Au&s;ig.</P>
<P>Au&s;ig is a &s;trong town &s;ituate upon the Elbe, nearly where that river leaves Bohemia. It had always &s;hewn a particular attachment to the emperor; and was recommended by him in &s;trong terms, together with the bridge in its neighbourhood, to the protection of the marqui&s;s. It was a &s;en&s;ible mortification therefore to that general to &s;ee an enemy
<PB N="326" REF="345">
already at its gates; and he determined to ri&s;k all, rather than leave it a prey.</P>
<P>Zi&s;ca, who carried on his works with his u&s;ual vigour, had brought the &s;iege to its la&s;t &s;tage, when the marqui&s;s appeared at the head of a great army, and offered him bat|tle. Zi&s;ca, who&s;e maxim it was, never to decline fighting, accepted the challenge, though he had many difficulties to encoun|ter. The marqui&s;s had a &s;uperior army, and Zi&s;ca was obliged &s;till more to thin his troops by leaving a large detachment to ob&s;erve the town. The Saxons be&s;ides were advanta|geou&s;ly po&s;ted, having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a ri&s;ing ground, which &s;ecured their flanks. A &s;trong wind al&s;o blew in the faces of the Taborites; which greatly weakened the flight of their arrows, while it added new force to tho&s;e of the enemy.</P>
<P>But Zi&s;ca had little confidence in mi&s;&s;ive weapons. His whole line, with their poll|axes and &s;abres, in their accu&s;tomed manner, made an impetuous attack upon the enemy. The Saxons, receiving them in good order, &s;tood firm, and gave them a very &s;evere check. This was a reception wholly unkown to the Taborites; who had ever been u&s;ed
<PB N="327" REF="346">
to bear down all before them; and in the&s;e new circum&s;tances were at a lo&s;s how to act. They retreated &s;ome paces, as if a&s;toni&s;hed at the novelty of the thing. &mdash; This critical moment the Saxons &s;hould have &s;eized, while the bla&s;t, yet fluttering in the &s;ails, &s;eemed to he&s;itate, on which &s;ide to give the &s;well. Had they moved forward at this in&s;tant, it is probable the Taborites had never recovered from their &s;urprize. But in&s;tead of a gene|ral charge, they &s;tood motionle&s;s; looking upon the enemy, as if they had done enough by not &s;uffering them&s;elves to be beaten.&mdash; Zi&s;ca, little le&s;s than in&s;pired, had a com|pleat idea of the whole affair; and being conducted to the front line, which &s;tood yet unbroken, he cried out, as he rode along, <Q>I thank you, my fellow-&s;oldiers, for all your pa&s;t &s;ervices,&mdash;if you have now done your utmo&s;t, let us retire.</Q> This noble rebuke &s;tung them to the &s;oul. Every vete|ran gna&s;hed his teeth with indignation, gra&s;ped his &s;word, and pre&s;&s;ed forward; clo&s;ing, hand to hand, with the enemy, in the true temper of determined courage.</P>
<P>The combat, thus renewed, became &s;oon unequal. For &s;ome time the Saxons &s;till
<PB N="328" REF="347">
maintained a feeble fight. Four of their principal officers, endeavouring to re&s;tore the battle, were cut to pieces at the head of their di&s;mayed battalions. The whole army &s;oon after, in every part, gave ground: a retreat, a rout, a ma&s;&s;acre &s;ucceeded. The carnage of the field was terrible. Not fewer than 9000 Saxons were left dead upon the &s;pot. Zi&s;ca is taxed, however ju&s;tly, with great cruelty, after all re&s;i&s;tance was over. It is certain he never bought a victory &s;o dear,</P>
<P>From this &s;cene of blood he recalled his troops to new fields of glory. <Q>We mu&s;t &s;leep to night, cryed he, within the walls of Au&s;ig.</Q> Thither the triumphant army carried the news of their victory. Zi&s;ca would grant no conditions: the governor was allowed half an hour to deliberate, whether he would &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, or take the con&s;equence. He cho&s;e the &s;afer mea|&s;ure; and the Taborites were quietly in their quarters in Au&s;ig before the clo&s;e of the evening. &mdash; The&s;e two great events con&s;e|crated the 22d of April, for many years, in Bohemia.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="348">The next day Zi&s;ca ordered the town to be di&s;mantled; that it might no longer be a receptacle to his enemies: he broke down likewi&s;e the &s;tately bridge over the Elbe; to cut off, as much as po&s;&s;ible, all communi|cation with Saxony.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ettled every thing in the ea&s;t of Bohemia, where he had been kept longer than he expected, and having freed that country even from the apprehen&s;ion of dan|ger, he returned with his victorious army to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Procop.</P>
<P>That general had &s;ufficient bu&s;ine&s;s upon his hands. The emperor appeared early upon the frontiers of Moravia; and after &s;ome irregular motions, &s;at down before Pernitz.</P>
<P>Procop with his little army attended all his movements; and practi&s;ed with admirable &s;kill tho&s;e le&s;&s;ons, which he had ju&s;t receiv|ed. He was confined however to the minutiae of war: he could not hurt, he could only teize, his unweildy adver&s;ary. If the em|peror offered him battle, his Parthian bri|gades, unincumbered with baggage, retreat|ed &s;uddenly to the mountains. If the em|peror returned to his former enterprize, Pro|cop was in&s;tantly in his rear; and, being
<PB N="330" REF="349">
acquainted with the country, be&s;et every avenue to his camp with &s;o much judgment, that Sigi&s;mond was obliged to &s;end large de|tachments, and often to run great hazard in procuring provi&s;ions. In a word, Procop &s;hewed him&s;elf, during the whole campaign, a compleat ma&s;ter of defen&s;ive war; and gave the emperor &s;uch a check, as he little expected from &s;o inferior a force.</P>
<P>In the mean time the town behaved with equal &s;pirit. Sigi&s;mond had now lain eight weeks before it, and had not yet made the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion either upon the walls, or the garri&s;on; though he had endeavoured his utmo&s;t, by his engines and his menaces, to &s;hake both. He was obliged therefore to &s;ubmit to his ill-fortune; and, drawing lines round the place, contented him&s;elf with &s;traitening its quarters, and &s;hutting it up by a blockade.</P>
<P>In this de&s;ign he was again unfortunate. He had reduced the town to great extremity, when, by one of tho&s;e ma&s;terly &s;trokes, which may deceive the greate&s;t captain, Procop drawing his attention to another quarter, forced his lines in an un&s;u&s;pected part, and threw &s;uccours into the place.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="350">This was a &s;evere blow to Sigi&s;mond. His work was entirely to begin anew; the &s;um|mer was wearing apace; the Saxons were totally defeated; and Zi&s;ca was returning with a victorious army. &mdash; Agitated by the&s;e reflections; and having nothing in pro&s;pect but new di&s;a&s;ters, he gave up his de&s;ign, and retreated.&mdash;Thus was Bohemia delivered once more from the fear of her enemies; and her champion, after a &s;hort but active campaign, was allowed to &s;heath his &s;word.</P>
<P>The news of Sigi&s;mond's retreat met Zi&s;ca near Prague. As the troops, having made forced marches from Au&s;ig, had been harra&s;&s;ed with intolerable fatigue, he thought it proper to give them a few days re&s;t. He incamped therefore within three leagues of Prague; and attended by a &s;mall body of hor&s;e, took up his own re&s;idence in the city. He had not been at Prague, &s;ince the late di&s;turbances, and hoped, by his pre&s;ence, to di&s;&s;ipate what might &s;till remain of ill-humour in the minds of the inhabitants. He was however mi&s;taken. His pre&s;ence, in&s;tead of re&s;toring harmony, appeared plainly to give new offence. He &s;oon had flagrant in&s;tances of the di&s;ta&s;te of the peo|ple;
<PB N="332" REF="351">
which he had the magnanimity to di&s;|regard, &s;till expecting it would wear off. On the contrary, it increa&s;ed daily, di&s;cover|ing it&s;elf in the mo&s;t gro&s;s affronts, and at length in the mo&s;t violent outrages.</P>
<P>At a very un&s;ea&s;onable hour, &s;omewhat after midnight, he was alarmed by an officer of his guard; who entering his chamber, with a di&s;turbed countenance, acquainted him, that he had no time to lo&s;e,&mdash; that the perfidious town&s;men were preparing to &s;eize him. Zi&s;ca a&s;king a few que&s;tions, and re|ceiving &s;uch an&s;wers as left him little room to doubt, immediately got on hor&s;e-back; ordering, at the &s;ame time, a ha&s;ty trumpet to &s;ound <HI>to hor&s;e,</HI> through the quarters. The troops, which con&s;i&s;ted of about 400 men, repaired directly, with &s;uch circum&s;tances of di&s;order, as may be imagined, to the great &s;quare. Not a man knew the cau&s;e of this &s;udden alarm. While they &s;tood enquiring one of another, and each forming &s;uch con|jectures, as his imagination &s;ugge&s;ted, their ears were &s;uddenly &s;truck with the &s;ound of bells, which bur&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly from every tower of the city, in one general peal. Im|mediately on this &s;ignal, they were attacked
<PB N="333" REF="352">
by multitudes of people, crouding through every avenue and &s;treet; but in that tumul|tuary manner, which plainly di&s;covered a di&s;concerted &s;cheme. The Taborites, placing their father, as they commonly called Zi&s;ca, in the centre, formed round him, as the exigence would allow; and defended them|&s;elves with great firmne&s;s. Indeed the ene|my made no extraordinary efforts; they &s;eem|ed contented with blocking up the avenues of the &s;quare, and throwing a few weapons, which did little execution. If any approach|ed nearer, and attempted a ruder a&s;&s;ault, a few hor&s;emen were ordered to ride in among them; who generally drove them back &s;ome paces. But this was only the reflux of a tide, which pre&s;ently returned.</P>
<P>In the mean time day-light appeared; and &s;hewed the Taborites the de&s;perate circum|&s;tances of their &s;ituation. Zi&s;ca, who was exactly informed of every thing, having called his officers about him, re&s;olved (as the only expedient in the pre&s;ent exigence,) to endeavour to force a way through the high &s;treet, which led to the camp.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this re&s;olution a vigo|rous attack was made. The citizens were
<PB N="334" REF="353">
pre&s;ently beaten off; and the Taborites gal|lantly fought their way through all oppo|&s;ition.</P>
<P>In the middle of the &s;treet their impetu|o&s;ity received a check. There a barricado had been begun, the ha&s;ty work of that tu|multuous morning. The materials indeed had been rather brought together, than put into form. It &s;erved however to retard the violence of Zi&s;ca. Many of his &s;oldiers were obliged to di&s;mount, to clear the pa&s;|&s;age; and could not afterwards recover their hor&s;es: all order was broken; and, the enemy clo&s;ing on every &s;ide, a &s;cene of great confu&s;ion en&s;ued.</P>
<P>At length the fortune of Zi&s;ca prevailed, with the lo&s;s of &s;ome men, though of fewer than might have been expected, he forced the barricado, and made his way to the gate.</P>
<P>Here the enemy endeavoured to form a &s;econd time; and a new &s;cene of tumult followed. But the gate was at length bur&s;t open; and Zi&s;ca, at the head of his little troop, &s;allied out in triumph. He was pur|&s;ued by all the force, that could be brought out again&s;t him; which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ome
<PB N="335" REF="354">
thou&s;ands; again&s;t whom he maintained a flying fight with &s;uch intrepidity, as made none of them very forward to clo&s;e in upon him. His di&s;mounted troopers, who had been of &s;o much &s;ervice in opening a pa&s;&s;age, were now of equal di&s;advantage in retarding his march: notwith&s;tanding which, the order of it continued unbroken.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this victorious retreat, an unfore&s;een accident almo&s;t proved fatal to him. The enemy were making one of their bolde&s;t efforts, when Zi&s;ca being &s;eparated from his company in the confu&s;ion of the attack, his hor&s;e, undirected, plunged into a mora&s;s. His per&s;on being con&s;picuous, he was pre&s;ently &s;urrounded; and a furious conte&s;t en&s;ued; in which the Taborites were victorious; and had the good fortune to re|cover their fainting general.</P>
<P>The route, which the Taborites took, led acro&s;s a fair plain, or rather valley, environ|ed with ri&s;ing grounds, which, approaching each other, at the farther end, formed a narrow pa&s;s. Here Zi&s;ca, who had been mi&s;erably harra&s;&s;ed along the plain, and had more open country beyond the defile, de|termined to make a &s;tand; thinking his de&s;|perate
<PB N="336" REF="355">
circum&s;tances a &s;ufficient apology for the appearance of ra&s;hne&s;s. Having drawn up his little troop therefore with all the ad|vantage, which accrued from his &s;ituation, he pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the enemy; who did not decline an engagement.</P>
<P>Hi&s;torians relate this battle with very im|probable circum&s;tances. We are told, that Zi&s;ca not only gained the victory, but that he put to the &s;word above 3000 of the ene|my. It is not unlikely, that if the &s;laughter from the beginning be taken into the ac|count, the Calixtin party might lo&s;e that number. &mdash; It is certain however, that Zi&s;ca made good his retreat; and arrived in &s;afety at his camp.</P>
<P>Great was the con&s;ternation in Prague, when the fugitives from this unfortunate attack returned without their prey. The Calixtin-party at fir&s;t intended to have cru&s;h|ed Zi&s;ca without di&s;turbance; not doubting but the di&s;&s;ipation of his &s;ect would follow. When that was found impracticable, they determined, at any rate, to cru&s;h him. Their fraud and force being equally in|effectual, they &s;aw them&s;eves in de&s;perate circum&s;tances. They had provoked a very
<PB N="337" REF="356">
powerful enemy, whom they could not with&s;tand; and from whom they had every thing to fear.&mdash;The die however was thrown; and they mu&s;t accommodate their game, as they were able.</P>
<P>In the mean time Zi&s;ca, calling his troops together, acquainted them in form with the whole tran&s;action; and having rai&s;ed in them &s;uch &s;entiments of indignation as he wi&s;hed to in&s;pire, he immediately &s;truck his tents, and like the injured Roman of old, marched directly to the city, and incamped under its walls.</P>
<P>Before he attempted force, he &s;ent in a trumpet, requiring, in very &s;tern language, that the advi&s;ers, and chief in&s;truments of the late villainous a&s;&s;ault &s;hould be put into his hands. But the guilt of that action was &s;o univer&s;al, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, who was involved the deepe&s;t. In&s;tead of complying therefore with the order of Zi&s;ca, the mi&s;erable inhabitants cho&s;e rather to try per&s;ua&s;ive arts; endeavouring by every me|thod to &s;often the chief, and move the com|pa&s;&s;ion of the troops. Intreaties, promi&s;es, and prayers were addre&s;&s;ed by the magi&s;trates to Zi&s;ca; while the populace, from the
<PB N="338" REF="357">
walls, made the &s;ame earne&s;t application to the &s;oldiers. Some pleaded kindred, or al|liances, or the rites of ho&s;pitality affection|ately performed. Many with tears deplored their wretched fate; prote&s;ting before God and man, that they had no hand in the late commotion: while numbers, who had a right to the protection of Zi&s;ca, from their adherence to his cau&s;e, were de&s;cribing their doors, and hou&s;es, or agreeing upon &s;ecret marks, and pledges, by which they might e&s;cape the impending vengeance; intreating, at the &s;ame time, one for a friend, another for a &s;on, or near relation, whom his un|happy fate had involved in the general guilt.</P>
<P>But Zi&s;ca continued &s;tern and immove|able. He was per&s;uaded the Calixtin-party could, by no means, be depended on; and that they would never unite in any friendly league. He determined therefore to take this opportunity of lei&s;ure from his other enemies, to &s;ubdue them thoroughly; a&s;&s;uring him&s;elf, that till this &s;hould be effected, the accompli&s;hment of his great de&s;igns would remain uncompleat.</P>
<P>The troops were more flexible. They con&s;idered not the affair with the fore&s;ight
<PB N="339" REF="358">
of their chief; and having only before their eyes the pre&s;ent &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, began to murmur at the work, in which they were engaged; and at the &s;everity of him, who had engaged them in it. <Q>They would not be the in&s;truments of the de&s;truction of a city, which was the glory of their country.&mdash;Their general might &s;eek other mini&s;ters of his vengeance.&mdash;They would offer their lives a willing &s;acrifice again&s;t the unju&s;t attempts of their enemies; but no one &s;hould oblige them to take up arms again&s;t their brethren.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e whi&s;pers &s;oon reached the ears of Zi&s;ca,&mdash;the fir&s;t &s;editious whi&s;pers he had ever heard. His orders he found hourly le&s;s punctually obeyed; he was acco&s;ted with in&s;olent &s;peeches, as he pa&s;&s;ed along the lines; and mutinous tumults gathered about his tent. In a word, he &s;aw the contagion &s;preading apace; and the immediate need of a remedy. Calling his troops therefore together, he endeavoured to a&s;&s;uage the ri&s;ing mutiny, by &s;hewing them the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;evere mea&s;ures. The Calixtins had now twice, he told them, almo&s;t ruined the com|mon cau&s;e; and would be ready to ruin it
<PB N="340" REF="359">
again on any future occa&s;ion. The emperor, he &s;aid, was always on the watch; and would be glad to widen their mi&s;under&s;tand|ings, and take the advantage of them for him&s;elf; he had no intention, he told them, to lay the city in blood and de&s;olation. All he propo&s;ed was to make him&s;elf entire ma&s;ter of it; and when he had it in his power, he would li&s;ten to the &s;ugge&s;tions of pity, and would temper &s;everity with mercy.</P>
<P><Q>This, my fellow-&s;oldiers, &s;aid he, con|cluding his &s;peech, is my intention: but if it &s;hall &s;eem more agreeable to you to act with greater lenity; if you &s;hall chu&s;e to reach out to the&s;e bloody men even an unlimited mercy, I &s;hall con&s;ider my&s;elf only as your mini&s;ter: and whether you chu&s;e war, or peace, I am ready with my utmo&s;t power to &s;econd that choice. &mdash; One thing only let me reque&s;t, for the &s;ake of all our mutual labours, and mutual glories, let me reque&s;t, that the&s;e unhappy divi&s;ions among&s;t us may cea&s;e; and that whether we &s;heath our &s;words, or keep them drawn, the world may know, that we are united in our councils, as well as
<PB N="341" REF="360">
our arms; and that Zi&s;ca, and his com|panions, have only one common cau&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>In &s;uch &s;oothing language did the prudent chief addre&s;s him&s;elf to the prejudices of his &s;oldiers. His &s;peech had the de&s;ired effect. They who did not hear it, caught the fire from tho&s;e who did. The whole army was in&s;tantly animated with a new &s;pirit; and the camp rang with profe&s;&s;ions of obedience, and acclamations of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>It was now near &s;un&s;et; too late to take the full advantage of the ardour of the troops. Orders therefore were given for an a&s;&s;ault early the next morning. Every thing was prepared. The regiments, in their &s;e|veral &s;tations, re&s;ted upon their arms; and Zi&s;ca retired to his tent, big with the thoughts of the &s;ucceeding day.&mdash;Many were the re|flections he made; and many the compuncti|ons he felt, when he thus found him&s;elf upon the point of laying wa&s;te the capital of his country. &mdash; But the liberties of Bohemia urged him upon this har&s;h &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As he was ruminating on the&s;e things, it being now pa&s;t midnight, a per&s;on was in|troduced to him by the officer of his guard, who earne&s;tly de&s;ired a private audience.
<PB N="342" REF="361">
Zi&s;ca pre&s;ently knew him to be the cele|brated Roque&s;an; an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, who, from the meane&s;t circum&s;tances of birth and for|tune, had rai&s;ed him&s;elf, by his great talents, to have the mo&s;t per&s;onal con&s;equence of any man in Prague. Roque&s;an came a deputy from his fellow-citizens, now reduced to the lowe&s;t de&s;pair. They had good intelligence from Zi&s;ca's camp; and well knew the fatal re&s;olution of the preceding evening.</P>
<P>Of what pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e two chiefs, on this occa&s;ion, we have no particulars. Roque&s;an however in&s;i&s;ted on &s;uch argu|ments, as over-powered the re&s;olution of Zi&s;ca; and a thorough reconciliation took place. An anonymous French hi&s;torian, who wrote the life of Zi&s;ca, mentions terms of agreement; but as the&s;e are unlikely, and, as far as appears, unauthorized, it is of little moment to in&s;ert them. It is probable, that Zi&s;ca would not &s;o ea&s;ily have been brought to a reconciliation, had not the late mutiny among his troops given a new turn to his coun&s;els.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were acting at Prague, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Sigi&s;mond was in great per|plexity. The battle of Au&s;ig had greatly
<PB N="343" REF="362">
&s;haken that con&s;tancy, which had thus far &s;upported him. Six times, in three cam|paigns, he had been vanqui&s;hed in the open field: his towns had been ravi&s;hed from him, and his provinces laid wa&s;te. He acknow|ledged the &s;uperior talents of his adver&s;ary; and was quitted by that noble and uncon|quered &s;pirit, which animated the cau&s;e of liberty. The late di&s;&s;ention had, in &s;ome degree, revived his hopes: but he was &s;carce informed of the circum&s;tances of the quar|rel, when he was informed of the reconci|liation likewi&s;e. Every ray of hope there|fore being now excluded, he &s;ubmitted to his hard fate; and re&s;olving on any terms, to give peace to his bleeding country, &s;ent deputies to Zi&s;ca, reque&s;ting him to &s;heath his &s;word, and name his conditions; offer|ing him, at the &s;ame time, for him&s;elf, what might have &s;atisfyed the mo&s;t gra&s;ping am|bition.</P>
<P>Zi&s;ca was equally de&s;irous of a reconcili|ation. He had taken up arms with a view only to obtain peace, and was heartily glad of an occa&s;ion to lay them down. He re|turned a me&s;&s;age to the emperor, full of that re&s;pectful language, with which the great
<PB N="344" REF="363">
can ea&s;ily cover enmity; tho' at the &s;ame time breathing that &s;pirit, which became a chief in the cau&s;e of liberty.</P>
<P>After a few couriers had pa&s;&s;ed, a place of congre&s;s was appointed; and Zi&s;ca &s;et out to meet the emperor, attended by the principal officers of his army. It gave Europe a &s;ub|ject for various conver&s;ation, when this great man, whom one unfortunate battle would have reduced to the condition of a rebel, was &s;een pa&s;&s;ing through the mid&s;t of Bo|hemia, to treat with his &s;overeign, like a &s;o|vereign, upon equal terms.</P>
<P>But Zi&s;ca lived not to put a fini&s;hing hand to this treaty. His affairs obliged him to take his route through a part of the country, in which the plague at that time raged. At the ca&s;tle of Pri&s;cow, where he had en|gaged to hold an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates of that di&s;trict, the fatal contagion &s;eized him, and put an end to his life, on the 6th of October 1424, &mdash; at a time, when, all his labours being ended, and his great purpo&s;es almo&s;t compleated, (&s;uch was the cour&s;e of providence) he had only to enjoy tho&s;e li|berties, and that tranquillity, which his vir|tue had &s;o nobly purcha&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="364">Some authors write, that, being a&s;ked by tho&s;e around him, a little before his death, where he would have his remains depo&s;ited? he an&s;wered, Where they plea&s;ed &mdash; that it was indifferent to him, whether they were thrown out to the vultures, or con&s;igned to the tomb.</P>
<P>We are informed too, that upon his death|bed he ordered his &s;kin to be made into a drum; <Q>The very &s;ound of which, added he, will di&s;per&s;e your enemies.</Q> It is probable this &s;peech is a mere fiction: &s;uch vaunting, agreeing ill with that re&s;erved cha|racter, which Zi&s;ca had ever maintained. Morery indeed tells us, that the drum was actually made; that it was u&s;ed in battle by the Taborites; and that it had the full effect expected from it; though at the &s;ame time, with a ridiculous gravity, he informs us, that he doth not &s;uppo&s;e it was owing to any &s;u|pernatural power, with which that in&s;tru|ment was endowed.&mdash;The whole &s;eems an idle tale. It may even be que&s;tioned, whe|ther the &s;kin of a body, in that morbid &s;tate, which the plague occa&s;ions, is capable of being cured; or if it were, we can hardly imagine, that any people could be &s;o infa|tuated,
<PB N="346" REF="365">
as fir&s;t to manufacture, and after|wards to carry about with them the remains of an infected carca&s;e.</P>
<P>The be&s;t accounts inform us, that he was buried in the great church at Cza&s;low in Bohemia; where a monument was erected to his memory, with an in&s;cription to this purpo&s;e;
<Q>HERE LIES JOHN ZISCA; WHO HAVING DEFENDED HIS COUNTRY AGAINST THE ENCROACHMENTS OF PAPAL TYRANNY, RESTS IN THIS HALLOWED PLACE IN DESPITE OF THE POPE.</Q>
The greate&s;t, indeed the only &s;tain on the character of Zi&s;ca, is his cruelty. Of this his enemies make loud complaints; and his friends, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, are very ill able to clear him. Again&s;t the popi&s;h clergy, it is certain, he acted with great &s;everity Many of them he put to death, and more he ba|ni&s;hed; plundering and confi&s;cating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, without any re&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="366">They who are the mo&s;t inclined to excul|pate this rigour, per&s;uade us, that he con&s;i|dered the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tics not as heretics, but as civil offenders; &mdash; as men, who were ac|countable for all the blood, which had been &s;pilt in Bohemia; and on who&s;e heads the ju&s;tice of an injured nation ought de&s;ervedly to fall.</P>
<P>But the be&s;t apology perhaps may be taken from the manners of the age, in which he lived. In tho&s;e barbarous times, and among tho&s;e barbarous nations, rough nature ap|peared in its rude&s;t form. Friends and ene|mies were treated from the heart, without that glo&s;s of decency, which arts, and civility have introduced.</P>
<P>Some allowance al&s;o may be made for the peculiar violence, which naturally attends civil di&s;&s;entions; in which every injury is greatly heightened, and every pa&s;&s;ion im|moderately moved.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, Zi&s;ca was by no means animated with that true &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, which his amiable ma&s;ter, Hu&s;s, had di&s;co|vered on all occa&s;ions. His fierce temper &s;eems to have been modelled rather upon the old Te&s;tament, than the new; and the
<PB N="348" REF="367">
genius of that religion in a great degree to have taken hold of him, which in its ani|mo&s;ities called down fire from heaven.</P>
<P>His capacity was va&s;t; his plans of action exten&s;ive; and the vigour of his mind in executing tho&s;e plans a&s;toni&s;hing. Difficul|ties with him were motives. They rou&s;ed up latent powers, proportioned to the emer|gence. Even blindne&s;s could not check the ardour of his &s;oul; and what was &s;aid of the Grecian Timoleon, under the &s;ame mi&s;|fortune, (who&s;e character indeed he re&s;em|bled in many in&s;tances) may with equal ju&s;tice be applyed to him; <HI>hanc calamitatem ita moderate tulit, ut ne&abque; eum querentem qui&s;|quam audierit, ne&abque; eo minus privatis, publi|ci&s;&abque; rebus interfuerit.</HI> His military abilities were equal to what any age hath produced; and as &s;uch they are acknowledged by all hi&s;torians. Nor do we admire him le&s;s as a politician. If the great man was &s;een in the conduct, and courage, which he di&s;covered in the field; he was equally &s;een in govern|ing, by his own native authority, a land of anarchy; and in drawing to one point the force of a divided nation.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="368">Nor was the end, which he propo&s;ed, unworthy of his great actions. Utterly de|void both of ambition and avarice, he had no aim but to e&s;tabli&s;h, upon the ruins of eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny, the civil and religious liberties of his country.</P>

<HEAD>The Conclu&s;ion of the BOHEMIAN AFFAIRS.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus brought the affairs of the Bohemian reformers to a glori|ous i&s;&s;ue under Zi&s;ca, it may be proper to continue the narration, in few words, till this great &s;truggle between the contending parties was decided.</P>
<P>After the death of Zi&s;ca, the flames of war kindled anew. It is probable, the em|peror, on this great event, might &s;u&s;pend, and finally break off the treaty, expecting better conditions.</P>
<P>Procop, who had &s;o greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in Moravia, and was e&s;teemed the able&s;t of Zi&s;ca's generals, naturally took the lead after his decea&s;e. This chief &s;u&s;tained the character he had acquired. Indeed the Taborite armies were now &s;o formed, and di&s;ciplined by the care, and abilities of Zi&s;ca; &s;o inured to all the difficulties of their pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="352" REF="370">
and &s;o formidable to their enemies, that the reputation of future generals was in a great mea&s;ure Zi&s;ca's due; who had laid a foundation, on which even inferior talents might &s;ucce&s;sfully build.</P>
<P>But Procop had talents to form a &s;cheme, which fortune had given him only to com|pleat. Yet he had &s;till great difficulties to encounter. To the old enemies of his cau&s;e a new one was added. The pope, incited by the clamours of the religious, reared his holy banners; and a formidable army, under a cardinal-general, was &s;ent into Bohemia. But his eminence &s;hared the fate of all his predece&s;&s;ors in this war; and the Bohemian arms triumphed, wherever they were op|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>To the military inventions of Zi&s;ca, Pro|cop added an improvement of his own. He introduced armed chariots into his lines, which &s;erved as a &s;ort of moving rampart; through the inter&s;tices of which his troops charged, and retired at plea&s;ure. On other occa&s;ions, his chariots would take a &s;udden wheel, and inclo&s;e whole battalions of the enemy; which, thus environed, were de&s;|tined to certain &s;laughter. He found them
<PB N="353" REF="371">
&s;till more u&s;eful in his ravaging excur&s;ions. They &s;erved, at the &s;ame time, as a defence to his marauders, and as waggons to carry off the plunder.</P>
<P>Procop had now continued in arms &s;ix years. His campaigns, though not di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by tho&s;e illu&s;trious actions, which had marked the campaigns of Zi&s;ca, were however generally &s;ucce&s;sful. He had not indeed tho&s;e opportunities of performing &s;plendid actions. The emperor, wa&s;ted by his va&s;t expences, had of late &s;uffered the war to langui&s;h; hoping to procure tho&s;e advantages from repo&s;e, which he could not force by his arms. He was well acquainted with the mutual animo&s;ities of the Tabo|rites, and the Calixtins, who agreed in no|thing, but in oppo&s;ing him: and he thought a little lei&s;ure, as it had hitherto done, might ripen their di&s;&s;entions. Procop, he knew, was an able general; but he had a mean opinion of him, as a politician&mdash;as a man either of temper, or addre&s;s to a&s;&s;uage or manage the rage of parties. Upon the whole, he had rea&s;on to hope, that time might produce &s;ome happy cri&s;is in his fa|vour. That cri&s;is now approached.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="372">In the year 1431, the council of Ba&s;il a&s;&s;embled. Hither the Taborites were in|vited with a profu&s;ion of civil language. But they received the &s;ummons with great indignation. It was the univer&s;al cry, <Q>That general councils were general pe&s;ts; &mdash; that they were called only in &s;upport of eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny;&mdash;and that no credit was due to &s;uch partial conventions.</Q></P>
<P>Procop however, with a magnanimity which could not brook the imputation of refu&s;ing a challenge of any kind, determined to attend the council: and when his friends urged the danger; and advi&s;ed him at lea&s;t to &s;ecure him&s;elf by a &s;ufficient pa&s;sport; they only made him the more re&s;olute in his purpo&s;e: <Q>Pa&s;&s;port! cried he, need we other than our &s;words?</Q></P>
<P>Thus re&s;olved, and accompanied by Co&s;ca, another leader of the Taborites, he &s;et out, at the head of a regiment of hor&s;e. The whole city of Ba&s;il came out to meet &s;o ex|traordinary a deputation. Every one was earne&s;t to compare the faces of the&s;e gallant heroes with the actions they had performed; and &s;aw, or thought they &s;aw, &s;omething more than human in tho&s;e countenances,
<PB N="355" REF="373">
the very appearance of which had put ar|mies to flight. The two deputies were re|ceived by the magi&s;trates at the gate of the city; and the fathers of the council (&s;o great a change, &s;ince the times of Hu&s;s, had the influence of power produced) paid them &s;uch honours, as were paid only to crowned heads. After many conferences, which ended in attaching them the more firmly to their own opinions, they returned into Bo|hemia.</P>
<P>The council however had an aftergame to play. Upon the departure of the Tabo|rite chiefs, they &s;ent deputies, cho&s;en from the mo&s;t eminent of their body, into Bohe|mia; who had in charge (out of the great regard the council had for the Bohemians, and their earne&s;t zeal to draw them to the true faith) to di&s;cu&s;s tho&s;e points at full lei|&s;ure in Prague, which the multiplicity of affairs would not allow at Ba&s;il.&mdash;This was their pretence: their real de&s;ign was, to di|vide the Bohemians; and to kindle again the old animo&s;ity, which had &s;o nearly proved fatal to both parties.</P>
<P>This bu&s;ine&s;s was carryed on with that &s;ingular addre&s;s, for which the court of
<PB N="356" REF="374">
Rome hath ever been remarkable in nego|tiations of this kind; and was at length, by the a&s;&s;iduity of the&s;e good cardinals, brought to a happy i&s;&s;ue. A great party, under Mignard, a man of courage and abilities, appeared in arms again&s;t Procop; and the fury of civil di&s;cord began to rage in all its violence.</P>
<P>The Taborites had now ample occa&s;ion to regret the clemency, which had formerly been &s;hewn at Prague; and remembered, with compunction of heart, how often their great chief would in&s;i&s;t, that no peaceful &s;ettlement could be obtained, till the factious &s;pirit of that city &s;hould be &s;ubdued.&mdash;But it was now too late for reflection.</P>
<P>Procop however, unconcerned, at the head of veterans, who&s;e valour he had known during ten campaigns, met his adver&s;ary with a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s. <Q>You have not now, my fellow-&s;oldiers, cryed he, di&s;ciplined Imperiali&s;ts, and hardy Saxons to oppo&s;e. Tho&s;e ho&s;tile banners belong to troops enervated by city-luxury; and in&s;pired by faction, in&s;tead of courage. You have only to begin the attack: their own guilty con&s;ciences will do the re&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="375">The cautious Mignard felt, with &s;ecret joy, the progno&s;tics of &s;ucce&s;s: he &s;aw the confidence of his impetuous enemy; and with the addre&s;s of a more experienced leader improved it fully to his own advantage.</P>
<P>On the plains of Broda this fatal quarrel was decided. Here the Taborite army, drawn by their ardour into in&s;uperable diffi|culties, after a well-fought day, was exter|minated. Here fell the gallant Procop, vainly endeavouring to re&s;tore a broken bat|tle; and with him fell the liberties of his country.</P>
<P>The battle of Broda opened an ea&s;y way to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Sigi&s;mond. The Calix|tin party having gratifyed their revenge, now paid the price. Reduced by their victory, they were no longer in a condition to oppo&s;e the emperor. Conquerors, and conquered &s;ubmitted to his yoke; and he was crowned peaceably at Prague, amid&s;t the acclamations of his enemies.</P>
<P>It would be unpardonable ingratitude in a prote&s;tant writer not to acknowledge the lenity, which attended this &s;udden revolu|tion. Sigi&s;mond, with a magnanimity, which few princes could exert, (it would be invi|dious
<PB N="358" REF="376">
to a&s;cribe his behaviour to meaner mo|tives) entered Bohemia, not as a conquered province, but as a patrimony, which had de|&s;cended to him quietly from his ance&s;tors. Such of the Taborites as had e&s;caped the carnage of that fatal day, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of a few thin garri&s;ons, in all about 6000 men, he took under his protection; &s;uffered them to live peaceably at Tabor; and &s;hew|ing them favour beyond any of the Bohe|mian reformers, (many of whom met with rougher u&s;age) allowed them with unparal|lelled genero&s;ity, the u&s;e of their own re|ligion.</P>
<P>Some years after, Eneas Sylvius, re&s;iding, with a public character, in Bohemia, had the curio&s;ity to vi&s;it Tabor. The account he hath left us of the remains of this brave people is not a little entertaining. The reader will make allowance for the zeal of a popi&s;h writer.</P>
<P>Returning, &s;ays he, to Prague, our route brought us near Tabor, which we had all an inclination to vi&s;it: but not knowing what &s;ort of reception we might meet with, we &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to acquaint the magi|&s;trates of the town with our names, and
<PB N="359" REF="377">
our intentions. We had a very obliging an&s;wer; and the principal inhabitants came out to meet us. But &s;o wretched a &s;et of people I never &s;aw. Their dre&s;s was rude, beyond what is commonly &s;een among the lowe&s;t vulgar; &s;ome of them were clad even in &s;kins. They rode on hor&s;eback; but their hor&s;es, and furniture were of a piece with their dre&s;s. Their per&s;ons too were ju&s;t as extraordinary: &s;carce one of them, but was disfigured by &s;ome frightful maim. One wanted an eye, another an arm, a third a leg. Their reception of us was equally void of every appearance either of form or politene&s;s. In their rude manner, however, they offered us each a trifling pre&s;ent; and brought us, by way of refre&s;hment, wine and fi&s;h. We then entered the town. Over the gate &s;tood a &s;tatue of Zi&s;ca; and near it an angel holding a cup; as an emblem of their maintaining the doctrine of the two &s;pecies. Their hou&s;es were very ordinary; built chiefly of clay, and wood; no regula|rity, no form of &s;treets; but every hou&s;e &s;tanding by it&s;elf. The in&s;ides however were better furni&s;hed than the out&s;ides &s;eem|ed to promi&s;e: they were inriched with the
<PB N="360" REF="378">
&s;poils of conquered provinces; which, to the everla&s;ting di&s;grace of the emperor Si|gi&s;mond, were never re&s;tored. In their great &s;quare &s;tood various forms of military en|gines; with a view, as we &s;uppo&s;e, to &s;trike a terror into the neighbouring country: tho' the people were become quite pacific, apply|ing them&s;elves only to hu&s;bandry, and me|chanic arts. In this &s;quare too &s;tood their temple, as they call it; a wooden &s;tructure, &s;carce &s;uperior to a country barn. Here they preached to the people: here they expounded their doctrines; here &s;tood their uncon&s;e|crated altar; and here even the holy &s;acra|ment was admini&s;tred. Their prie&s;ts were unornamented, except by beards of an im|moderate length. Tythes were entirely di&s;|allowed. The clergy had no property. They were &s;upply'd with all nece&s;&s;aries, in kind, by the people. Images were wholly forbid|den. No prayers to &s;aints were permitted; no holidays; no &s;et fa&s;ts; no canonical hours. Half the &s;acraments were di&s;carded. Religious hou&s;es were abominations. Their bapti&s;mal font was uncon&s;ecrated: their dead buryed in unhallowed ground. They were punctual however in their attendance upon
<PB N="361" REF="379">
divine &s;ervice; and had very &s;evere penalties to inforce a reverence to it.</P>
<P>The next day, upon our departure, the magi&s;trates of this wretched town came again to wait upon us, and returned us thanks for our vi&s;it. Their &s;peech, on this occa&s;ion, had more of politene&s;s in it, than their ap|pearance &s;eemed to promi&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>A POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus given the reader what appeared mo&s;t worthy of his notice, with regard to the&s;e eminent reformers, who&s;e lives I have attempted, it may be pro|per to acquaint him with tho&s;e helps, and authorities, which I have commonly u&s;ed. I have indeed taken from other writers, be|&s;ides tho&s;e I &s;hall mention; but I have ge|nerally in that ca&s;e quoted them in the text, if the incident was of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>In the life of Wicliff, the labour of col|lecting was made very ea&s;y to me by the in|du&s;try and accuracy of Dr. Lewis, who hath brought together, in his life of that reform|er, great plenty of materials. Had he been as happy in the di&s;po&s;ition of them, I &s;hould not have thought the new lights, which I have endeavoured to throw upon this great
<PB N="363" REF="381">
character, a &s;ufficient apology for my en|gaging in the &s;ame work.</P>
<P>Lord Cobham's life was collected from the rolls of parliament, Bale's chronicle, Fox's martyrology, and our earlie&s;t Engli&s;h hi&s;torians. With relation both to Wicliff and Lord Cobham, I examined the manu|&s;cripts of the Briti&s;h mu&s;eum, where I hoped to have found a great variety of materials. I found &s;ome; but fewer than I expected.</P>
<P>Lenfant's very accurate, and judicious hi&s;tory of the council of Con&s;tance, was of great u&s;e to me in the lives of John Hu&s;s, and Jerome of Prague. I examined the earlie&s;t and be&s;t accounts I could meet with, of the progre&s;s of the reformation in Bohe|mia; but in all conte&s;ted points I relyed chiefly on Lenfant's judgment, whom I may venture to call my principal guide.</P>
<P>With regard to Zi&s;ca, I was more at a lo&s;s. It hath been the misfortune of this chief to have had no &s;ober hi&s;torians. Eneas Sylvius, the principal, and from whom the generality of writers have taken their leading facts, though a courtier, &s;eems to have writ|ten in the &s;pirit of a monk. Credulous, and
<PB N="364" REF="382">
prejudced, he appears &s;carce to de&s;erve a higher rank in letters than our own legendary writers. Where Lenfant's judgment a&s;&s;i&s;ted me, I followed without fear; but where he for&s;ook me, I was obliged to wander among a variety of &s;trange, and incon&s;i&s;tent accounts; and with &s;ome difficulty picked out a pro|bable road. I make no que&s;tion but Zi&s;ca won as many battles, and took as many towns as are a&s;cribed to him; and that the con&s;tituent parts of his hi&s;tory re&s;t upon a good foundation of credit; but his actions are related &s;o much in the air of romance, that I found it nece&s;&s;ary, in the painter's language, to <HI>keep down</HI> the colouring as much as po&s;&s;ible. Livy, &s;peaking of &s;ome romantic writings of his own country, from which he was obliged to copy; cries out, <HI>Haec ad o&s;tentationem &s;cenae gaudentis miraculis aptiora, quam ad fidem.</HI> I am afraid in &s;ome in&s;tances, this character is too nearly allied to the writings I have been de&s;cribing.</P>
<P>I cannot clo&s;e this po&s;t&s;cript without a few &s;trictures on the moral, as well as literary character of Eneas Sylvius. This zealot, in his u&s;ual exaggerated manner, hath taken great liberties with the reformers; indulging
<PB N="365" REF="383">
him&s;elf in a rancour of language again&s;t them, which mu&s;t be offen&s;ive to every &s;ober Chri&s;tian. I could produce a variety of ex|amples; but &s;hall content my&s;elf with one. The reader may recollect the account he gives of the Taborites, after the ruin of their affairs; from which any impartial per&s;on would be led to conclude, that they were a brave, liberal, inoffen&s;ive, ho&s;pitable, and religious people. How greatly therefore are we &s;urprized to find our author concluding to this effect.</P>
<P>"I have now given you, &s;ays he, &s;ome account of this habitation of the devil, this temple of Belial, this kingdom of Lucifer. &mdash; I had imagined indeed, that this people differed from us only in one, or two points: but I find them confirmed heretics, mere infidels, little better than athei&s;ts, and with|out any form of religion. &mdash; Every here&s;y, every impiety, every bla&s;phemy, which hath infected Chri&s;tendom, hath fled hither for refuge; and hath here met with a &s;afe a&s;y|lum. &mdash; For my own part, I thought my&s;elf in a land beyond the frozen ocean, among Barbarians, even among Cannibals; for in all the earth there are &s;urely no &s;uch mon|&s;trous
<PB N="366" REF="384">
people as the Taborites. &mdash; Yet even to the&s;e &s;acrilegious, and mo&s;t abominable men did the emperor Sigi&s;mond grant a city; nay he allowed their liberty to wretches, whom not to exterminate was a &s;candal to Chri&s;ten|dom."</P>
<P>With &s;uch freedom does the licentious pen of this writer treat the reformers. His cen&s;ures are entirely founded on their opini|ons. Of their practice he &s;ays nothing. That indeed was irreprehen&s;ible. But among bigots, morals are always infinitely lower rated than opinions. Had the faith of the Taborites been unque&s;tioned, their practice however licentious, had been unque&s;tioned too.&mdash;But to &s;ee the real value of the invec|tives of this author, let us examine him a little clo&s;er; and in&s;tead of condemning him in the gro&s;s for his opinions, let us treat him more fairly, and try his opinions by his practice.</P>
<P>A volume of his familiar letters &s;urvived him: &s;ome of which appear to have <HI>e&s;caped</HI> into public among the croud. In the&s;e let|ters, among other pa&s;&s;ages, the following will &s;ufficiently &s;hew, what licence he in|dulged in point of morals; &s;ome of which

pa&s;&s;ages fell from him even in his more ad|vanced age.</P>

<P>In his 15th letter he tells a long &s;tory of his debauching an Engli&s;h lady in the low countries; and triumphantly thus exults, <HI>&s;cis qualis tu gallus fueris; nec ego ca&s;tratus &s;um, nec ex frigidorum numero.</HI></P>
