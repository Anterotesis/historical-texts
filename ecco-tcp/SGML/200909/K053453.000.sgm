<HEAD>TO THE ELECTORS OF GREAT BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN time of &s;ecurity, when pro&s;perity &s;miles upon the land, the eloquence of an angel would not be attended to; but, when Princes, to become &s;ove|reign ma&s;ters, trample under foot, without &s;hame or remor&s;e, the mo&s;t &s;acred rights of the people, atten|tion is excited by the mo&s;t minute object, and even the voice of a man &s;o un&s;upported as my&s;elf may have effect upon the minds of the public.</P>
<P>If by collecting into one point of view under your eyes the villainous mea&s;ures planned by Princes to attain ab&s;olute empire, and the di&s;mal &s;cenes ever attendant on de&s;poti&s;m, I could in&s;pire you with hor|ror again&s;t tyranny, and revive in your brea&s;ts the holy flame of liberty which burnt in tho&s;e of your forefathers, I &s;hould e&s;teem my&s;elf the mo&s;t happy of men.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the pre&s;ent parliament, by law, mu&s;t &s;oon expire; and no di&s;&s;olution was ever more earne&s;tly
<PB N="vi" REF="4">wi&s;hed for by an injured people. Your mo&s;t &s;acred rights have been flagrantly violated by your repre|&s;entatives, your remon&s;trances to the throne artfully rejected, your&s;elves treated like a handful of di&s;af|fected per&s;ons, and your complaints &s;ilenced by pur|&s;uing the &s;ame conduct which rai&s;ed them. Such is your condition, and if &s;uch it continues, the little liberty which is yet left you, mu&s;t &s;oon be extin|gui&s;hed: but the time for redre&s;s is now approaching, and it is in your power to obtain that ju&s;tice you have &s;o many times craved in vain.</P>
<P>As long as virtue reigns in the great council of the nation, the prerogative of the crown, and the rights of the &s;ubjects, are &s;o tempered that they mutually &s;up|port and re&s;train each other: but when honour and virtue are wanting in the &s;enate, the balance is de&s;troyed: the parliament, the &s;trength and glory of Britain, becomes a profligate faction, which, par|taking of the mini&s;ter's bounty, and &s;eeking to &s;hare with him the &s;poils of their country, joins tho&s;e at the helm in their criminal de&s;igns, and &s;upports their de&s;tructive mea&s;ures,&mdash;a band of di&s;gui&s;ed traitors, who, under the name of guardians, traffic away the national intere&s;ts, and the rights of a free-born people: the Prince then becomes ab&s;olute, and the people &s;laves.
<PB N="vii" REF="5">&mdash;A truth of which we have unfortunately had but too often the &s;ad experience.</P>
<P>On you alone, Gentlemen, depends the care of &s;ecuring the freedom of parliament; and it is &s;till in your power to revive that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, which, in the la&s;t century, humbled the pride of a tyrant, and broke your fetters: but to effect this, how careful mu&s;t you be in your choice of tho&s;e into who&s;e hands you &s;hall tru&s;t your authority?</P>
<P>Reject boldly all who attempt to buy your votes; they are but mercenary &s;uitors, who covet only to enlarge their fortune at the expence of their honour, and the intere&s;t of their country.</P>
<P>Reject all who have any place at court, any employ|ment in the di&s;po&s;al of the great officers of the crown, any commi&s;&s;ion which the King can improve. By men thus dependant, and of which the &s;enate is chiefly compo&s;ed at pre&s;ent, how can you hope to be repre|&s;ented with fidelity?</P>
<P>Reject all who earne&s;tly mendicate your voice; there is no good to be expected from that quarter. If they had nothing at heart but the honour of &s;erving the public, do you imagine that they would &s;ubmit to act &s;uch a di&s;graceful part? Tho&s;e humiliating in|trigues are the tran&s;actions of vice, not of virtue.
<PB N="viii" REF="6">Merit indeed is fond of honourable di&s;tinctions; yet &s;atisfied with proving worthy of them, it never deba&s;es it&s;elf to beg them, but waits till they are offered.</P>
<P>Reject men of pompous titles; among them there is little knowledge and le&s;s virtue: nay, what have they of nobility but the name, the luxuries and the vices of it?</P>
<P>Reject the in&s;olent opulent; in this cla&s;s are not to be found the few virtues which are left to &s;tock the nation.</P>
<P>Reject young men; no confidence is to be placed in them. Wholly given up to plea&s;ure in this age of degeneracy; di&s;&s;ipation, amu&s;ements, and debauchery, are their only occupation; and, to &s;upport the ex|pen&s;ive gaieties of the capital, they are ever ready to act with zeal in the intere&s;ts of a mini&s;ter. But &s;up|po&s;ing them not corrupt, they are but little acquainted with the national intere&s;t; be&s;ides, naturally incapable of long continued attention, they are impatient of re&s;traint, they would have nothing to do, but to give their votes, and cannot attend to what they call the dry bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e, and fulfil the duties of a good &s;enator.</P>
<P>Select for your repre&s;entatives men di&s;tingui&s;hed by their ability, integrity, and love for their country;
<PB N="ix" REF="7">men ver&s;ed in the national affairs, men whom an inde|pendent fortune &s;ecures from the temptations of poverty, and a di&s;dain of ruinous pageantry from the allurements of ambition; men who have not been corrupted by the &s;miles of a court, men who&s;e venerable mature age crowns a &s;potle&s;s life; men who have ever appeared zealous for the public cau&s;e, and have had in view only the welfare of their country, and the ob&s;ervance of the laws.</P>
<P>Confine not your choice to the candidates who offer them&s;elves; invite men worthy of that tru&s;t, wi&s;e men who de&s;ire to be your repre&s;entatives, but can|not di&s;pute that honour with the rich without merit, who labour by bribes to force it out of your hands; do it in &s;uch a manner, that for the plea&s;ure of &s;erv|ing their country, they &s;hall have no occa&s;ion to dread the ruin of their fortune; and &s;corn even to eat or drink at pro&s;tituted tables.</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t efforts will be exerted, as u&s;ual, by the mini&s;try to influence your choice. Are the alluring baits of corruption to triumph over your virtue? Is the Briti&s;h &s;pirit &s;o &s;unk that none dur&s;t &s;corn to receive a bribe? When your great com|mon intere&s;t ought to direct you, &s;hall the &s;el|fi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions dare to rai&s;e their voice? Are they worthy to be indulged at &s;uch a price? Behold the
<PB N="x" REF="8">di&s;mal &s;cenes ari&s;ing from neglect of national intere&s;t; behold your &s;enators bu&s;y in making, altering, and amending acts for &s;ecuring the property of their dogs, whil&s;t half of the &s;ubjects, lingering in mi&s;ery from the villainy of monopolizers, cry to them for bread; behold your country bleeding at the feet of a mini|&s;ter of the wounds &s;he has received.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the whole nation ca&s;t their eyes upon you for redre&s;s; but if your heart be &s;hut to generous feelings, and ju&s;tice to your fellow &s;ubjects cannot move you, let your own intere&s;t at lea&s;t animate you.</P>
<P>To you is left a power to &s;ecure the liberty of the people, or en&s;lave the nation; during the time you proceed to election you are, it may be termed, the arbiters of the &s;tate, and can teach tho&s;e to trem|ble before you, who would make you tremble before them. Be made &s;en&s;ible of the importance of your functions; let honour rai&s;e its voice, and a becoming pride elevate your minds. How can the dignity of your office be united with the infamy of cor|ruption?</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the candidates are lavi&s;h of fawning care&s;&s;es, and &s;pare no ba&s;ene&s;s to gain you to their intere&s;ts, but look upon you with di&s;dain, from the in&s;tant they have extorted your votes. Re&s;ent &s;uch affront, reject their hypocritical courte&s;y, think on the in&s;olent
<PB N="xi" REF="9">contempt which follows, and fix your choice upon men who are con&s;cious of what they owe to their con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>Parliament under undue influence will do no act to promote the public welfare: Nay, tho&s;e who have carried their election with money, not &s;atisfied with neglecting your intere&s;t, treat you as a mercenary gang of &s;laves; eagerly &s;eeking to be repaid any way, they traffic away your rights, and u&s;e the power you have tru&s;ted them with, to ruin you. Are the baits of corruption &s;o attractive as not to be counterbalanced by the &s;olid advantages tendered by virtue? But what are the bribes taken for votes, to the lo&s;&s;es &s;uffered by a neglect of your intere&s;ts, to the advantages you would reap from being repre&s;ented with ability and fidelity?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what you owe to your country and your|&s;elves, con&s;ider what you owe to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>How careful were your ance&s;tors, although with hazard of their lives, to tran&s;mit tho&s;e rights as entire to their children as they had received them from their fathers. What they did with labour, you may do with ea&s;e; what they did with danger, you may do with &s;afety. Will the holy flame of liberty which burnt in their brea&s;ts never burn in yours? Will you
<PB N="xii" REF="10">di&s;grace the names of your forefathers? Will you not &s;hudder with horror at the idea of injuring your po&s;|terity? Is the age of liberty pa&s;&s;ed away? Shall your children, bathing their chains with tears, one day &s;ay, &mdash;The&s;e are the fruits of the venality of our fathers?</P>
<P>Gentlemen,</P>
<P>With virtue and courage a people may ever main|tain their liberty: but when once this ine&s;timable trea&s;ure is lo&s;t, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to recover it; and it is very near being &s;o, when electors &s;et a price on their votes.</P>

<HEAD>THE CHAINS OF SLAVERY.</HEAD>
<P>IT appears the common lot of mankind not to be allowed the enjoyment of liberty: Princes every where are a&s;piring to de&s;poti&s;m, and the people &s;inking to &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of De&s;poti&s;m is replete with un|common events: On one &s;ide, we &s;urvey the bold de&s;igns of &s;ome ambitious men, their villainous attempts, and the &s;ecret &s;prings they put in action to attain illicit power: on the other &s;ide, we &s;ee the people, whil&s;t repo&s;ing under the &s;hade of their own laws, en&s;laved; we behold the vain efforts of an unfortunate multitude to &s;hake off oppre&s;&s;ion, and the numberle&s;s evils con&s;tantly attendants on &s;lavery. Scenes at once horrible and magnificent, wherein alternately appear peace, plenty, &s;ports, pomp,
<PB N="2" REF="16">fe&s;tivals, di&s;&s;entions, mi&s;ery, artifice, treachery, trea&s;on, bani&s;hments, conte&s;ts and carnage.</P>
<P>Sometimes De&s;poti&s;m is e&s;tabli&s;hed at once by the force of arms: but this rapid progre&s;s of power to ab&s;o|lute Empire is not the &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent work: it is the &s;low and gradual efforts of policy, which by degrees &s;ubject the necks of the people to the yoke, depriving them at the &s;ame time both of the means and de&s;ire of &s;haking it off.</P>
<P>From attentively con&s;idering the e&s;tabli&s;hment of de&s;poti&s;m, it is evident that Slavery is only the effect of time, and the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the defects of political con&s;titutions. Let us endeavour, there|fore, to di&s;cover how by their means the Magi&s;trate u&s;urps the title of Ma&s;ter, and &s;ub&s;titutes his will for the law. Let us review that multiplicity of machines, which the &s;acrilegious audacity of Princes has recour&s;e to, in order to &s;ap the foundation of liberty: let us follow their dark projects, their crafty proceedings, their &s;ecret plots, enter into a detail of their fatal policy, unfold the principles of that deceitful art, and reduce to one point of view the various attacks that have been made upon Public Freedom. But in arranging my ob&s;ervations, I &s;hall le&s;s regard the order of time than the connection of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="17">When once the dangerous tru&s;t of public authority is committed to a Prince, and the care of enforcing obedience to the laws to Magi&s;trates, the people &s;ee them&s;elves &s;ooner or later &s;ubdued by tho&s;e rulers they have made choice of, and their liberty, their property, their lives at the di&s;cretion of tho&s;e who have been appointed to protect them. No &s;ooner has the Prince ca&s;t his eyes upon the tru&s;t repo&s;ed on him, but he endeavours to forget from what hands he received it: Full of him&s;elf and of his power, he &s;upports impatiently the idea of his dependance, and con&s;tantly labours to free him&s;elf from every &s;ort of re&s;traint.</P>
<P>The people are never voluntary &s;laves, they yield not to power, but when they believe it to be a duty, or are unable to oppo&s;e it. Hence in a &s;tate newly founded or reformed, the &s;ubjects are not at once en|&s;laved, however imperfect the con&s;titution might be. De&s;pair, that prompted them at fir&s;t to throw off the yoke, would prompt them to throw it off anew when|ever they &s;hould feel its weight. To commence with open attacks upon liberty, and to attempt to de&s;troy it by violence, would prove therefore a ra&s;h under|taking. When tho&s;e who govern, daringly di&s;pute the &s;upreme power with open force, and the people
<PB N="4" REF="18">perceive their rulers attempting<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>If we properly attend, we &s;hall find, that no State is in its origin of great extent, and that all owe their increa&s;e to no other cau&s;e but conque&s;t or alliance.</P></NOTE> to en&s;lave them, the latter ever prevail, and the Prince in a moment lo&s;es the fruit of all his efforts. At his fir&s;t attempt the &s;ubjects unite again&s;t him, and his authority is at &s;take, if his conduct be not more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive than im|perious. It is not therefore by open attacks Princes fir&s;t attempt to en&s;lave the people, they take their mea&s;ures in &s;ecre&s;y, they have recour&s;e to craft: it is by &s;low but con&s;tant efforts, by changes almo&s;t im|perceptible, by innovations of which it is difficult to ob&s;erve the con&s;equences, and &s;uch as are &s;carcely taken notice of.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Power of Time.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t attack Princes make upon the public liberty, is not the violating audaciou&s;ly the laws, but the cau&s;ing them to fall into oblivion. To enchain their &s;ubjects, they begin by &s;etting them a&s;leep.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="19">Whil&s;t men have their heads heated with ideas of liberty, and whil&s;t the bloody image of Tyranny is &s;till before their eyes, they dete&s;t de&s;poti&s;m, and watch with inquietude every motion of the Mini&s;try. The Prince at that time is cautious not to form any attacks upon public freedom; he appears the father of his people, and his reign the aera of ju&s;tice.

<P>When Charles II. a&s;cended the throne of Spain, the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of the mini&s;ter was to re&s;tore plenty to the kingdom, and to indulge the people with &s;hows; never in that country were &s;een &s;o many bull-fights, plays, and other entertainments after the ta&s;te of the nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;ormeaux, Abreg.

<P>Louis XIV. applied him&s;elf to win the hearts of his &s;ubjects, by his engaging manners, his prodigality and

He was careful no one &s;hould depart di&s;&s;atisfied from his pre&s;ence, he &s;ecured by lucrative employments tho&s;e whom he &s;u&s;pected, and by favours gained to him&s;elf even the in&s;atiate croud of courtiers. At court, he amu&s;ed the people with fea&s;ts, fireworks, balls, ma&s;querades, tournaments, &s;hews of every kind. In his campaigns, he repeated the fea&s;ts, he vi&s;ited in his wonted pageantry the towns that had &s;ubmitted to his power; he invited to his table women of quality, conferred gratifications on the military, &s;cattered gold among the populace, and was applauded to the &s;kies.

<P>Louis I. of Spain &s;ignalized the beginning of his reign by loading with kindne&s;s all tho&s;e who ap|proached him.</P>
<P>Ferdinand VI. on a&s;cending the throne, endeavoured to gain popularity by apparent airs of goodne&s;s: he ordered the pri&s;ons to be opened to all who had been committed for no capital crimes; he granted a general amne&s;ty to de&s;erters and &s;mugglers, and appointed two

<P>Princes often-times apply them&s;elves by an affected conde&s;cen&s;ion to win the hearts of the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The people of Venice admire the goodne&s;s of their ma&s;ters, when they &s;ee the Doge at the head of the Senate making the yearly proce&s;&s;ion to St. Maria Formo&s;a, to di&s;charge a promi&s;e of one of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors, and not &s;corning to accept of a &s;traw hat and two bottles of wine, that the arti&s;ans of the pari&s;h pre&s;ent him for his trouble: when they &s;ee the Doge on the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t accepting of a few melons pre|&s;ented to him by the gardeners, and allowing them to ki&s;s him: when they &s;ee the Senators a&s;&s;i&s;ting with the Doge on Shrove-Tue&s;day at the &s;laughter of a bull, or at &s;ome other popular entertainment: when they &s;ee the grand-council on Corpus Chri&s;ti day pa&s;&s;ing in proce&s;&s;ion through St. Mark's place, each Noble yielding the right hand to a beggar.</P>
<P>How &s;trange &s;oever it may appear, Princes &s;ome|times attain to de&s;poti&s;m by means which in appear|ance tend to produce a contrary effect.

<P>At other times, tho&s;e who govern, that they might conceal their own corruption, attempt to corrupt others; that they might conceal their own ambition, they flatter that of the people, they &s;peak to them perpetually of their rights, affect an extreme zeal for their intere&s;ts, and rai&s;e them&s;elves to tyranny by affecting to protect them.</P>
<P>But in order to en&s;lave mankind, Princes have even affected an aver&s;ion to Empire: Some have laboured to promote the public happine&s;s; and taking

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of procuring Opulence.</HEAD>
<P>EVER by ways &s;trewed with flowers, Princes have begun to drive their &s;ubjects to &s;lavery.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t the &s;ubjects are indulged with fea&s;ts and &s;hows, but as the&s;e entertainments cannot long con|tinue, unle&s;s the Prince has the di&s;po&s;al of the &s;poils of the whole world, a la&s;ting &s;ource of corruption is then opened to the people: indu&s;try is encouraged, and commerce rendered flouri&s;hing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This a&s;&s;ertion will undoubtedly appear very &s;trange to tho&s;e, who have their eyes fixed on the feudal government degenerated into de&s;poti&s;m or oligarchy. Princes encourage indu&s;try and commerce in their do|minions, they will &s;ay, in order to increa&s;e their revenues, not to aba&s;e their &s;ubjects: I reque&s;t the reader to con&s;ider, that I do not &s;peak of a people already under the yoke, but of tho&s;e who are intended to be &s;ub|jected thereto. Thus, not mentioning the efforts made &s;ome centuries ago, in the &s;tates of Venice, Genoa, Florence, in France, Spain, Eng|land, &amp;c. to encourage indu&s;try, arts and commerce among the &s;ubjects, let us con&s;ider what attempts in that re&s;pect have been made by Princes of a free people. The antient Britons, like the Goths, and other Celtic nations, were almo&s;t entirely independant; and as long as they remained &s;plit into many &s;mall tribes, with no other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions but their arms and flocks, it proved impo&s;&s;ible to their chieftains to become ab&s;olute. But in order to &s;ubject them, the Romans introduced the arts of peace, com|merce and urbanity. Agricola chiefly taught them to procure them&s;elves 
<PB N="24" REF="38">the conveniencies of life, he endeavoured to render their condition plea&s;ing; and the Britons &s;o much &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the domination of their new ma&s;ters, that, once &s;ubdued, they gave them no more un|ea&s;ine&s;s, and lo&s;t all de&s;ire, even all idea of their former independency. <HI>Tacit. in Agricol.</HI></P>
<P>Thus likewi&s;e did Alfred, to &s;ubdue the Anglo Saxons.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="37"></NOTE>, in order to pro|cure opulence. Now opulence is always attended by luxury.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of Luxury.</HEAD>
<P>ONE effect of luxury is the extingui&s;hing the heroic virtues; for, when men can attract notice by &s;umptuous equipages, co&s;tly dre&s;s, long retinue of &s;ervants, they are no more &s;olicitous of attracting it by upright manners, noble &s;entiments, glorious deeds.</P>
<P>Luxury is immediately attended by a loo&s;ene&s;s of manners, which is the beginning of their depravation: both &s;exes meet together in order to render their intercour&s;e more agreeable, and corrupt them&s;elves reciprocally; gallantry is introduced; this produces a frivolous turn of mind, puts a value on trifles, de|pre&s;&s;es whatever is of any concern; and duty is &s;oon forgotten.</P>
<P>The arts which luxury maintains, and the plea&s;ures it promi&s;es, rendering &s;ociety delightful, hurry us away to effeminacy; they &s;often our manners, and
<PB N="25" REF="39">enervate that haughtine&s;s which endures neither fetters nor re&s;traint.</P>
<P>By concealing with flowers the chains which are prepared for us, they extingui&s;h in our &s;ouls the &s;en&s;e of liberty, and make us in love with &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>Hence Princes generally neglect nothing which may bring luxury into e&s;teem: they recommend it by their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As luxury &s;o much charms the multitude, as to induce them to be guilty of a thou&s;and extravagancies, ever attended with the ruin of the &s;tate, Princes, after having countenanced it, were often obliged to re|&s;train it. But by a contra&s;t not uncommon, while they repre&s;&s;ed luxury by their proclamations, they encouraged it by their example.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Lewis XIV. prohibited, by his edicts to the lieutenants-general and other officers of his armies who kept an open table, the &s;erving up of any other di&s;hes, except pottage, roa&s;t-meat, and the like, he him|&s;elf di&s;played on his table the productions of all climates. Whil&s;t he fixed the quantity of gold or &s;ilver to be allowed for plate, furniture, equipage, dre&s;s, &amp;c. he him&s;elf &s;quandered the public money in mag|nificent extravagancies.</P>
<P>Let Princes i&s;&s;ue out as many proclamations as they plea&s;e, luxury will not the le&s;s prevail. Tho&s;e ordonances act even again&s;t the purpo&s;e they are intended for, as they give more value to what they prohibit, and en|crea&s;e the de&s;ire of enjoying it. From this very con&s;ideration they are &s;ometimes made.</P></NOTE> example; they di&s;play every where page|antry and magnificence, and are the fir&s;t to &s;ow in the minds of their &s;ubjects tho&s;e &s;eeds of corruption<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The exce&s;&s;ive love of plea&s;ure, that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the courts of James I. Charles II. Louis XIV. &amp;c. infected all ranks of men. Every day pro|duced
<PB N="26" REF="40">&s;ome fea&s;t, and every night &s;ome ma&s;k, in which people of fortune engaged: di&s;&s;ipation and luxury took place of &s;implicity and application.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="39"></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="40">If Princes recommend not luxury by their example, they at lea&s;t countenance it, or refu&s;e to re&s;train it. The Roman Senate, &s;till compo&s;ed of grave Magi&s;trates, propo&s;ed to Augu&s;tus the reformation of the manners and of the luxury of women; but though obliged by his office of Cen&s;or to attend to it, he ever artfully avoided the importunate reque&s;t of the Se|nators<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dio Ca&s;&s;ius, lib. liv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some have gone even &s;o far as to force their &s;ubjects to &s;ink into effeminacy. In order to &s;ubdue the inha|bitants of Cuma, Ari&s;tomenes laboured to enervate the courage of the youth: he ordered the boys to let their hair grow, to adorn their heads with flowers, and, like girls, to wear long gowns of various colours; he commanded them, when going to their dancing or &s;inging ma&s;ters, to be attended by women with umbrellas and fans; in the bath they were to be &s;erved with looking-gla&s;&s;es, combs and perfumes: this way of education was continued till they were twenty years of age<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Diony&s;. Halicarn. lib. vii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus by enervating and corrupting the people, luxury &s;ubdues them without re&s;i&s;tance to the will of
<PB N="27" REF="41">an imperious Ma&s;ter, and forces them to purcha&s;e, at the price of their liberty, the quiet life and &s;oft plea&s;ures they are permitted to enjoy.</P>

<HEAD>CONTINUATION OF THE SAME SUBJECT.</HEAD>
<P>LUXURY not only enervates the minds, but no|thing is better calculated to divide them; when once introduced into a &s;tate, the union of its mem|bers is de&s;troyed; every one endeavours to attract notice, to become more con&s;picuous than his neigh|bour, and ri&s;e above the common level. Carele&s;s of the good of the public, they then attend to their private intere&s;ts only; the love of one's patria is ex|tingui&s;hed in every heart; the citizen di&s;appears, and the man remains.</P>
<P>Luxury, as it extends it&s;elf, ranks &s;uperfluity among nece&s;&s;aries. At fir&s;t the people abandon them&s;elves to di&s;&s;ipation; it becomes habitual to them; plea&s;ures are nece&s;&s;ary; and as every one cannot enjoy them equally, they are actuated by various &s;entiments: on one &s;ide are envy, jealou&s;y, hatred; on the other, pride and contempt&mdash;new &s;eeds of di&s;cord!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>How many Princes have fomented the&s;e divi&s;ions by their ordonances.

<P>WHEN once men are corrupted by luxury, new de&s;ires prey alternately on the mind. If the means of indulging them are wanting, every one bu&s;ies him&s;elf to &s;upport the extravagances in which he delights.</P>
<P>The evil grows wor&s;e every day, &s;ince from much endeavouring to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, no one at la&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hes him&s;elf any more; but as a rank is taken, and as a de&s;ire of attracting the eyes of the public &s;till continues, every nerve is bent in order to get out of that intolerable uniformity. From that time there is no proportion between the wants and the means; every one is eager after riches, and bows down in the temple of Fortune. How many voluntary &s;laves!</P>
<P>Finally, a multitude of &s;ubjects, needy by their new wants, and vexed to be the meane&s;t of all, vainly agitate them&s;elves to get off their humiliating poverty, and are at la&s;t reduced to wi&s;h for their country's de&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="43">Such is the powerful influence of luxury, that often|times nothing more is wanting to compleat the de&s;truc|tion of liberty, even in countries the mo&s;t fond of it.</P>
<P>As long as Rome was inhabited by poor citizens, hone&s;ty, honour, courage, and love of liberty, were inclo&s;ed within its walls; but when once it was en|riched with the &s;poils of vanqui&s;hed nations, the&s;e ancient virtues gave way to a multitude of vices. Notwith&s;tanding the wi&s;dom of the laws, no &s;ooner were its gates open to the riches of the enemy, but Rome cea&s;ed to acknowledge its degenerated off|&s;pring; manners and duties became oppo&s;ite to each other; poverty, till then honoured, fell into con|tempt; gold became the object of every one's de&s;ire; luxury expanded it&s;elf with rapidity; all plunged headlong into voluptuou&s;ne&s;s: and when plea&s;ures had once impoveri&s;hed the&s;e Sybarites, a multitude of lavi&s;h citizens, a&s;hamed of their poverty, caballed from ambition, and di&s;turbed public tranquillity; whil&s;t &s;ome powerful men alternately put them&s;elves at the head of the mob, tore the &s;tate to pieces, &s;pilled the blood of the citizens, u&s;urped the &s;upreme power, and &s;ilenced the laws.

<P>The Venetians take great care to maintain their &s;ubjects in plenty, to &s;et them free from moral re&s;traint, and indulge them with &s;hews.

<P>WHILST the de&s;ire of acquiring fame burns in the brea&s;t of the &s;ubjects, and they are greedy after glory alone, liberty is never more &s;ecure. They &s;tand un&s;haken at dangers, di&s;heartened by no ob&s;ta|cle, and re&s;trained by no con&s;ideration; le&s;s fear|ing

<P>Princes accordingly lo&s;e no opportunity of changing the object of glory. For fame, which the public di&s;pen&s;es, they &s;ub&s;titute honours which they alone di&s;tribute; and in&s;tead of making dignities the reward of &s;ervices done the patria, they make honours the &s;alary of &s;ervices tendered to them.

<P>In order to be in favour with the monarch, they &s;peak emphatically of his little merit; they allow him to po&s;&s;e&s;s virtues of every kind, and extol the happine&s;s of being under his empire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is oftentimes the ca&s;e with both hou&s;es of parliament, not to pro|portion words to things in their addre&s;&s;es of thanks to the throne.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVIII.</HI> Of di&s;uniting the People.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING engaged the people to lo&s;e fight of their patria, an attempt is made to annihilate the love of it in their hearts. Men united by liberty and for liberty mu&s;t remain free, as long as they re|main united; to be en&s;laved they therefore ought to be divided, and time never fails to offer an opportu|nity for it.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t in every &s;tate, there are from its foundation various ranks of people; nobles ever di&s;dain the ple|beians, and plebeians ever hate the nobles, or rather, every one who belongs to any rank, hates or de&s;pi&s;es tho&s;e who belong to another: the&s;e ba&s;e pa&s;&s;ions Princes make u&s;e of to &s;ow di&s;&s;ention, and alienate the affections of the people from their patria.</P>
<P>If there is originally no diver&s;ity of ranks, tho&s;e at the helm labour to introduce it: they divide the people into different cla&s;&s;es, and to every one a&s;&s;ign
<PB N="41" REF="55">particular employments, rights or privileges. The one is appointed to magi&s;tracies, the other to military &s;ervices; this to eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices, that to trade and mechanical arts.</P>
<P>Till the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of the Romans, the patricians only were nominated to the magi&s;tracy; and till the emperors, every order of citizens was not admitted to military &s;ervice.</P>
<P>None but noblemen were to be admitted into the order of knights templars, and none are to be admitted into that of knights of Malta, but tho&s;e who&s;e nobility can be proved by many de&s;cents.</P>
<P>In France, noblemen, military men, and the king's honorary councellors alone, are free from a land-tax, called <HI>la taille.</HI></P>

<P>Of their &s;ubjects of Terra Ferma, the burge&s;&s;es are treated with indulgency, the nobles with &s;everity.</P>
<P>Looking upon the Paduans as the antient ma&s;ters of Venice, the &s;eignory took particular care to keep them di&s;united. For that purpo&s;e, the mo&s;t powerful families were tran&s;ported to Venice, and &s;uch privileges granted to the &s;tudents of the univer|&s;ity as to incen&s;e the jealou&s;y of the citizens.</P>

<HEAD>CONTINUATION OF THE SAME SUBJECT.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to &s;ow di&s;cord among their &s;ubjects, almo&s;t all Princes have tolerated different religious &s;ects: &s;ome of them have even countenanced particular &s;ec|taries; others, with the &s;ame views, have per&s;ecuted them.</P>
<P>The&s;e artifices prove &s;o de&s;tructive to liberty, that by their aid many Princes have governed their people in an arbitrary manner.&mdash;A truth of which we our|&s;elves have more than once had the &s;ad experience.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="58">When the reformation had extended it&s;elf among us, this kingdom was divided into two parties, who alternately having recour&s;e to the king, obliged him oftentimes to hold the balance between them; but to cru&s;h them both with their own hands, he made it incline now towards one &s;ide, then towards the other.</P>
<P>"As Henry VIII. was a &s;lave to his furious pa&s;|&s;ions, each party flattered them&s;elves that a blind com|pliance with the king's will would throw him fully into their intere&s;ts, and they implicitly put them&s;elves into his hands."</P>
<P>While the people were in &s;ucceeding times divided into Whigs and Tories, and as &s;oon as the&s;e two fac|tions were made irreconcileable by the artifices of the court, and could counterbalance the forces of each other, Charles II. pulled off the ma&s;k, di&s;&s;olved the parliament; and the nation beheld with a&s;toni&s;hment, a king who had received &s;o many mortifications from the legi&s;lative powers, and had been &s;o often obliged to &s;ubmit, on a &s;udden, without fleet, without army, without money, and without foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, become ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of his kingdom; letting his oppo&s;ers feel the terrible effects of his vengeance, &s;acrificing the mo&s;t &s;pirited patriots to his rage, and governing his &s;ubjects with a tyrannical &s;way.</P>

<P>Hitherto the attempts made again&s;t liberty have not alarmed the &s;ubjects.

<P>PRINCES cannot alone ruin liberty, they ab&s;o|lutely want &s;ome aid; and as their mini&s;ters are to be their chief tools of tyranny, they commit the execution of their dark de&s;igns to crafty men, to men without honour, hone&s;ty, and con&s;cience. Some of the mo&s;t artful confer no office, no place of any autho|rity, but to men of new families, who being &s;en&s;ible that they owe every thing to royal favour, are content to &s;upport the power of the crown, though at the ex|pence of ju&s;tice and national privileges; and the better to &s;ecure their projects, they even admit but few into the cabinet.</P>
<P>Henry VII. ever ruled by a faction, and that by the le&s;&s;er faction. To give full &s;cope to his tyrannical rapacity, he nominated for his mini&s;ters Emp&s;on and Dudley, two profligate men, equally enabled by their knowledge in the law to pervert the forms of ju&s;tice to the oppre&s;&s;ion of the innocent, and perfectly quali|fied to prey upon the defencele&s;s people.</P>

<P>But as if national mercenaries were not &s;ufficiently devoted to tyranny, Princes, to oppre&s;s their &s;ub|jects, have recour&s;e to foreigners.</P>

<P>In England, there are indeed no foreign &s;oldiery, but &s;everal Scotch regiments are con&s;tantly &s;tationed there, and from the good harmony which reigns between the two nations, the king re&s;igns to them the odious part of oppre&s;&s;ing his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>At Venice, the wearing of arms is prohibited by the mo&s;t &s;evere law.</P>

<P>THE &s;ubjects, to keep them&s;elves free, have no other means but watchfulne&s;s, &s;pirit and virtue; the Prince, to &s;ubdue them, has &s;o many means that he is embarra&s;&s;ed only in his choice of them: that, however, which he mo&s;tly makes u&s;e of is cunning.

<P>When the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects are about taking &s;ome re&s;olution in order to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of tyranny, they always meet with &s;ome ob&s;tacle. Let them form what de&s;ign they plea&s;e, the Prince prevents the execution of it immediately. Let them entreat the redre&s;s of grievances, their petitions are fruitle&s;s; the Prince alledges his &s;cruples, refu&s;es to comply, and oftentimes returns mockery to their complaints; he an&s;wers, <HI>"That he is always ready to hear the griev|ances of his &s;ubjects; that he is never &s;o much concerned as about the well-being of his people,"</HI> and di&s;mi&s;&s;es them with fair words.</P>
<P>If the &s;ubjects per&s;i&s;t in their re&s;olution, the Prince per&s;i&s;ts in his conduct. Ever applying their minds to
<PB N="83" REF="97">the maxims of a fraudulent policy, tho&s;e at the helm learn the art of not being di&s;heartened by difficulties, of taking advantage of the weakne&s;s of men, of ca|jolling into acquie&s;cence the ea&s;y multitude; and as it is their method, when they mean to prevail over the people, to promi&s;e them every thing, with a view of performing none; whil&s;t the malcontents are earne&s;t in their reque&s;t, the Prince amu&s;es their credulity with fair promi&s;es, and without any &s;hame of break|ing his word, repeats this mean artifice.</P>
<P>In the time of <HI>la Fronde,</HI> public &s;afety having been attacked by many arbitrary exiles and impri&s;onments, the parliament of Paris at la&s;t obtained from the king a law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an edict of the 22d Oct. 1645.</NOTE> for &s;ecuring the liberty of the &s;ubject; but &s;oon after this law was infringed in the per&s;on of Chavigni.

<P>If incen&s;ed at &s;o many fal&s;e promi&s;es, and weary with &s;eeing their hopes &s;o many times baffled, the malcontents exclaim loudly for ju&s;tice, the Prince even then attempts to delay; he &s;ends them deputies to amu&s;e them, he &s;tops the provoked multitude, diverts their fury, or cools it by vain con&s;ultations, till the moment when he can without danger encoun|ter them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Amid&s;t the various in&s;tructions Charles V. delivered to his &s;on, he advi&s;ed him "to yield when the tempe&s;t blows high; not to oppo&s;e the fury of angry de&s;tiny; to e&s;chew tho&s;e &s;trokes he cannot re&s;i&s;t; to beg quarter, and watch a favourable opportunity." <HI>Silhon's Mini&s;tre d'Etat,</HI> liv. iii. chap. 6.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>If he is forced to treat, he at fir&s;t makes them &s;uch offers as he knows will be rejected, next he makes propo&s;als more rea&s;onable but expre&s;&s;ed in a vague manner, calculated to conceal his duplicity, and which binding him to no particular obligations, leaves him always ma&s;ter of the terms of accommodation; or he adds to clear conce&s;&s;ions &s;ome ob&s;cure clau&s;e which renders them void, if fal&s;e engagements rather are not taken.</P>
<P>Alarmed at the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of the people to the Sacred Mount, the Senate of Rome &s;eeing them&s;elves obliged

<P>In 1641, Charles I. wanting to find, for the legi&s;|lative body, employment of &s;uch con&s;equence as &s;hould engro&s;s their whole attention, and make the people believe he was willing to con&s;ent to whatever &s;hould be productive of a perfect reconciliation be|tween him and his parliament, whil&s;t he was making preparations to vindicate his own terms, &s;ent them the following me&s;&s;age: "That they would with all &s;peed fall into con&s;ideration of all tho&s;e particulars which they &s;hould hold nece&s;&s;ary, as well for the up|holding and maintaining his Maje&s;ty's ju&s;t and regal authority, and for the &s;ettling his revenues, as for the pre&s;ent and future e&s;tabli&s;hment of their privileges, the free and quiet enjoying their e&s;tates and fortunes, the liberty of their per&s;ons, the &s;ecurity of the true religion now profe&s;&s;ed in the Church of England, and the &s;ettling of ceremonies in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould take away all ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence. Which when they had dige&s;ted and compo&s;ed into one entire body, that &s;o his Maje&s;ty and them&s;elves might be able to make the more clear judgment on them, it &s;hould

<P>In the in&s;urrection of 1647 at Naples, as the people entreated the delivery of the charter of their privileges, the Viceroy, &s;olely intent on di&s;&s;ipating the impend|ing &s;torm, ordered a copy of it to be forged, which he tendered for the original<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Giannone Hi&s;t. di Nap.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the fury of the in&s;urgents empty &s;ounds only are oftentimes oppo&s;ed. Some men, &s;killed in the art of &s;educing the people, preach to them, and the ea&s;y multitude yielding to fair words, become the &s;port of a few florid orators.</P>
<P>Even a &s;ingle tale is &s;ometimes &s;ufficient to baffle the de&s;igns of revolted &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>Con&s;idering the e&s;teem of the public for their leaders as de&s;tructive of his projects, mercenary &s;crib|blers are engaged for attempting to vindicate the proceedings of admini&s;tration, for a&s;per&s;ing popu|lar men, and defaming tho&s;e who are &s;o &s;pirited as to oppo&s;e the villainous attempts of power.

<P>Sometimes attempts are made to engage the popular leaders to di&s;grace them&s;elves.</P>

<P>During the minority of Louis XIV. as the parlia|ment of Paris exclaimed aloud again&s;t the odious exactions made on the &s;ubjects; with a view of engaging the magi&s;trates to defend for the future their own intere&s;ts only, and thus to di&s;grace and ruin them&s;elves in the minds of the people, the Regent encroached upon their rights, by appropriating to government for a while their &s;alaries<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. du Card.

<P>When Barnavelt &s;et him&s;elf again&s;t Maurice of Na&s;&s;au, who attempted to a&s;&s;ume a monarchic power over Holland, Maurice cau&s;ed him to be charged with being the head of the Arminians; and under that pretence had him dragged into a pri&s;on by his ungrateful fellow citizens, and thence to a &s;caffold.</P>

<P>With a view of delivering the people from the op|pre&s;&s;ion of the Nobles, the Tribune C.

<P>After the Scots had revolted again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ive government of Charles I. they &s;ent him, at York, a petition for redre&s;s of grievances, to which the king an&s;wered, "That he required the petitioners to ex|pre&s;s the particulars of their de&s;ires, he having been always ready to redre&s;s their grievances." But in the mean while he was &s;tudious to make a trial of the affection of the York&s;hire gentlemen, he endeavoured to incen&s;e them, by fal&s;e in&s;inuations, again&s;t the Scots, and attempted to call together the lords of England in order to obtain a &s;ub&s;idy. Obliged finally to treat, he ordered his commi&s;&s;ioners not to &s;tipulate

His perfidious duplicity did not end here. Scarcely had the parliament of England met, but Charles entreated them to declare them&s;elves again&s;t the Scots; he &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ured them, that he was re&s;olved to gain the affection of his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, and promi&s;ed redre&s;s of national grievances.

<P>James II. alarmed at the de&s;igns of the Prince of Orange, attempted a reconciliation with the Church of England.

In propor|tion as his fears increa&s;ed, he took, with reluctancy, &s;ome other &s;teps towards the redre&s;s of grievances, he di&s;&s;olved the High Commi&s;&s;ion Court, ordered the
<PB N="94" REF="108">bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter to re&s;tore Magdalen college ac|cording to its &s;tatutes, commanded the lord lieute|nants of the &s;everal counties to inform of the abu&s;es committed on the late regulation of corporations, re&s;tored to corporations their ancient charters; Popi&s;h ju&s;tices of peace, mayors, recorders, and other magi|&s;trates were removed, and Pro&s;te&s;tants put in their places. Thus actuated by nece&s;&s;ity, he de&s;troyed with his own hands the work which him&s;elf had rai&s;ed, a reform which continued no longer than his dan|ger. Upon the news of the di&s;per&s;ion of the Prince's fleet by a tempe&s;t, he revoked &s;ome of his acts of grace granted to his &s;ubjects. The bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter was recalled on &s;ome frivolous pretence, and the re&s;toration of the college deferred. When the Dutch army had landed, the King, having great confidence in the &s;uperiority of his own forces, upon hearing that the city of London were preparing to addre&s;s him for an accommodation with the Prince of Orange, declared publicly, that he would look upon all tho&s;e as his enemies, who &s;hould pretend to give him &s;uch advice. But the Prince's troops being joined by a multitude of &s;ubjects, and &s;ome lords petitioning him to call a free parliament, he returned an&s;wer, "That he mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired what they a&s;ked, and promi&s;ed, upon the faith of a king, that he would
<PB N="95" REF="109">have a parliament, and &s;uch a one as they a&s;ked for, as &s;oon as ever the Prince of Orange had quitted this realm." He then publi&s;hed a proclamation for calling a free parliament; but repenting his re&s;olution, he cau&s;ed the writs that were to be i&s;&s;ued to be burnt, and imagining that it would not be po&s;&s;ible to call a lawful parliament without his concurrence, he threw the great &s;eal into the Thames, that nothing might be done legally in his ab&s;ence, then left his dominions to go and implore foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t his people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tindal.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>DESPOTISM owes its &s;upport greatly to igno|rance.</P>
<P>It is ignorance which, by ob&s;tructing the &s;ight of the people, prevents them from being acquainted with their own rights, and vindicating them.</P>
<P>It is ignorance which, concealing from them the am|bitious de&s;igns, the &s;ecret practices, the low artifices of Princes, prevents them from obviating tyranny, from &s;topping the progre&s;s of lawle&s;s power, and ruining it entirely.</P>
<P>It is ignorance which, enforcing obedience to many fal&s;e maxims, ties the hands of the people, &s;ubjects their necks to the yoke, and makes them &s;ubmit with reverence to arbitrary commands.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="113">It is ignorance, in a word, which induces the peo|ple to pay willingly to tyrants all tho&s;e duties they arrogantly require, and the credulous vulgar to reve|rence them as if they were Gods.</P>
<P>In order to &s;ubdue his &s;ubjects, the Prince labours to blind them. Con&s;cious of the unlawfulne&s;s of his own de&s;igns, and &s;en&s;ible of what he has to fear from clear-&s;ighted men, he endeavours to deprive the people of every means of acquiring knowledge.</P>
<P>How many crafty devices have not Princes employed to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of learning?

<P>However, let this fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertion pa&s;s. Undoubt|edly there are now and then &s;ome di&s;turbances in a democratical government; but is there none in ari&s;to|cratical and monarchical ones?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the&s;e di&s;turbances ari&s;e le&s;s from a popular con&s;titution than from its corruption; for if the peo|ple are generally incon&s;iderate, if they oftentimes en|gage them&s;elves in fal&s;e &s;teps, and &s;ometimes eagerly pur&s;ue their mi&s;ery, they are likewi&s;e, when not bribed, always ready to yield to men who&s;e virtue and judgment they re&s;pect.

<P>We are told of the frequent factions, &s;editions, and rebellions, in popular governments; but has a people

<P>We are terrified at public di&s;&s;en&s;ions. From the fires of di&s;cord, however, all tho&s;e laws, which were made formerly at Rome in favour of liberty, took their origin; and from the fires of di&s;cord liberty has ari&s;en among us.</P>
<P>Men are too ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon by the noi&s;e of civil di&s;cords. During the long di&s;turbances which agitated Rome from the Tarquins to the Gracchi, there were but few bani&s;hments, but few impri&s;on|ments, and almo&s;t no blood &s;hed; but from tho&s;e tranquil reigns, which are &s;o much boa&s;ted of, let as long a period le&s;s fertile in tragic &s;cenes be pointed out; how many were incomparably more &s;o! What mi&s;chiefs were ever cau&s;ed at Rome by the di&s;&s;en&s;ions of the Forum, to be compared with the horrors of the calm reigns of Tiberius, Nero, Cali|gula? What evils were ever &s;uffered by any people under popular government, to be compared with tho&s;e we &s;uffered under Henry VII. Mary, Charles I. and James II. And that &s;o much extolled calm of mo|narchical &s;tates, what is it, but the &s;ad &s;ilence of an unfortunate people, who dare not vent their griefs?</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="124">Thus the prai&s;es be&s;towed on governments, where the Prince is too powerful, are &s;o many traits which point out their deformity.</P>
<P>Conque&s;ts are ever repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t happy events in a reign. But not to &s;peak of tho&s;e acts of violence and inju&s;tice which are in&s;eparable therefrom, what generally are conque&s;ts, but the ruin of nations, even of conquerors them&s;elves? How dear the con|que&s;t of a new province to the ancient ones?

Let the benefits that a &s;tate receives from that vain glory be put in compari&s;on with the evils it is productive of.</P>
<P>What did the ambition of a Charles V. avail, but to de&s;olate Europe, to ruin his &s;ubjects, to &s;ee the conquered provinces wre&s;ted from his hands, and to force him at la&s;t to bury in a mona&s;tery his grief and &s;hame?</P>
<P>What the ambition of a Philip II. but to kindle war every where, to &s;hed torrents of the blood of his &s;ubjects, to cau&s;e the ocean to &s;wallow up his nume|rous fleets, to allow no re&s;t to his people, to &s;quander the immen&s;e trea&s;ures of Spain and India, to ruin his exten&s;ive dominions, and to bury with him&s;elf the eclat of his crown.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="125">What the ambition of a Charles XII. but to carry terror over Europe, to enlarge his empire, to lo&s;e in a few hours the fruits of nine years victories, and to abandon his own dominions to the &s;word of the enemy?</P>
<P>Such are almo&s;t con&s;tantly the fruits of the ambi|tion of Princes:&mdash;a plague the mo&s;t fatal with which Heaven puni&s;hes tho&s;e nations that dare not free them|&s;elves therefrom.</P>
<P>Writers emphatically prai&s;e the magnificence and liberalities of monarchs; why not rather cen&s;ure tho&s;e odious prodigalities, which in order that pageantry be di&s;played, and that a few individuals may abound in riches, oblige the greate&s;t part of the nation to live &s;paringly, or linger in mi&s;ery. But even were the people the con&s;tant objects of royal munificence, how is it po&s;&s;ible to give them much without taking much more from them?</P>
<P>Writers exhau&s;t them&s;elves in prai&s;ing the gene|ro&s;ity of Princes; but can Princes even po&s;&s;e&s;s that virtue? What are gifts which co&s;t nothing but the trouble of a command?</P>
<P>That which is gained with difficulty and labour, or deducted from conveniency and nece&s;&s;ity, when given with di&s;cernment; that alone, I &s;ay, is to be

<HEAD>CONTINUATION OF THE SAME SUBJECT.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY religion countenances de&s;poti&s;m, but none &s;o much as the Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of being connected with the political &s;y&s;tem, the Chri&s;tian religion is univer&s;al in its principle; it has nothing exclu&s;ive, nothing more peculiar to any country than to another; it embraces equally all mankind in its charity, takes away the bar which &s;eparates nations, and unites all Chri&s;tians in a fra|ternity.&mdash;Such is the true &s;pirit of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Liberty depends on the love of the patria; but the reign of Chri&s;tians is not of this world; their patria is in heaven, and to them earth is a place of pilgrimage only. How then can a people, longing but for things above, be concerned for things below?</P>
<P>All human in&s;titutions are grounded on human pa&s;|&s;ions, and &s;upported by them only; the love of liberty is united to that of well-being, to that of temporal enjoyments: but the Chri&s;tian doctrine in&s;pires us with an aver&s;ion for tho&s;e enjoyments, and is continu|ally combating our terre&s;trial inclinations. Wholly engro&s;&s;ed by another life, men are but little concerned about this.</P>
<P>To maintain them&s;elves free, the people mu&s;t have an eye ever upon government; they mu&s;t watch all
<PB N="116" REF="130">its motions, oppo&s;e all its illegal attempts, and curb its audacity. How can men, whom religion prohi|bits being &s;u&s;picious, be thus watchful; how can they put a &s;top to the &s;ecret practices of the enemies to liberty, how detect them, how even &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch men exi&s;t? Without &s;u&s;picion, without cunning, without wrath, without re&s;entment, a true chri&s;tian is at the di&s;cretion of the fir&s;t who forms an attempt upon him.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of the go&s;pel is a &s;pirit of lenity, of charity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>If religion influenced the Prince as well as the &s;ubjects, that &s;pirit of charity which is the great characteri&s;tic of a true Chri&s;tian, would undoubt|edly mitigate the exerci&s;e of power; but when we con&s;ider that the le&s;&s;ons of the Go&s;pel cannot take root in a heart given up to plea&s;ure and di&s;&s;ipation; when we con&s;ider that its precepts cannot re&s;i&s;t pernicious maxims con|&s;tantly repeated, bad examples ever under the eye, temptations ever new, we are made &s;en&s;ible that religion cannot rule tho&s;e who live at court.</P>
<P>Some religious Princes have however been &s;een, it will be &s;aid. If by religious Princes, bigots, hypocrites, or fanatics, are meant, I agree; and yet the&s;e were men who&s;e youth had been &s;pent under the direction of prie&s;ts, men who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were not naturally violent, men who&s;e hearts worn out by plea&s;ures, or brought back by age to the timidity of infancy, cau&s;ed them to be credulous; men, in a word, who, &s;eparating morality from the tenets of faith, like the Phari&s;ee, admitted that part of religion only, which indulged their vicious propen&s;ities.</P>
<P>But if the precepts of the Chri&s;tian religion have but very little influ|ence on the heart of a Prince, it is chiefly in Catholic countries, where the prie&s;ts grant di&s;pen&s;ations to the rich for money, furni&s;h them a thou&s;and 
<PB N="117" REF="131">pretended means of atonement, and &s;ometimes incite them to redeem, by new crimes, a whole life &s;pent in iniquities. Now when the &s;inner may hope for Paradi&s;e without fearing Hell, religion has no more any empire.</P>

<P>WHEN the cabinet is compo&s;ed of powerful men, rival&s;hip, jealou&s;y, pique, and ambition, oftentimes incite them to traver&s;e each others projects, and make them mi&s;carry. When it is compo&s;ed of many members, the various turn of their minds generally &s;ets them at variance, re&s;pecting de&s;igns and the means of execution. Hence Princes, impatient to attain ab&s;olute power, have always compo&s;ed their cabinet of few men, and men of new families. Such was the craft of Ferdinand of Arragon, of Philip II. Louis XI. Henry VII. Henry VIII. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Some Princes, by a refinement of policy, have even laid down a fixed plan of operations.</P>
<P>It was the pur&s;uit of the &s;ame projects during the reigns of Louis XIII. and Louis XIV. that &s;o much increa&s;ed the power of the crown: for Mazarine punctually followed the maxims of Richelieu, and le Tellier tho&s;e of Mazarine.</P>

<P>POWER now advances by rapid &s;teps towards de&s;|poti&s;m. The Prince, on the point of making any bold attempt, prepares his engines. If he can do
<PB N="155" REF="169">without the legi&s;lature, he carefully ab&s;tains from a&s;&s;embling them; if their concurrence is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, he again employs his former arts to influ|ence them, and by bribes, promi&s;es, threats, &s;ecures a &s;trong party; when &s;ecured, he ventures to a&s;&s;emble this pretended &s;overeign, and makes it re&s;olve what he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;ubjects, wholly engaged with their private affairs, or carele&s;s of public intere&s;ts, take no notice of the blind devotion of the &s;enate to the court, and the Prince continues with eagerne&s;s to urge on the execution of his de&s;igns. Yet if any one &s;hould at|tempt to open the eyes of the public, the mini&s;try, under pretence of maintaining good order, per&s;ecute this zealous patriot; then confounding the cau&s;e of the crown with that of the laws, they charge him with refractory proceedings, and have him puni&s;hed as a di&s;turber of the public peace.</P>
<P>If the public open their eyes and complain, they are amu&s;ed by frivolous objects, calculated only to fix unquiet minds, or their attention is engaged by a politic war.</P>
<P>Under colour of &s;ecuring national intere&s;ts, or vin|dicating the glory of the &s;tate, the Prince arraigns a neighbouring power, demands &s;ub&s;idies from his peo|ple,

<P>During the cour&s;e of a long government, liberty is de&s;troyed by gradual alterations, and is ever recovered by violent efforts only: but the Prince takes &s;uch cautious mea&s;ures that, once &s;ubdued, the &s;ubjects may never be enabled to break their yoke again.

<P>IN order that tho&s;e men who are placed at the head of the troops, might &s;upport the overgrown power of the crown, and not controul it, Princes are not &s;atisfied with having &s;uppre&s;&s;ed every military office of too great influence, but divide the army into many &s;mall bodies, among which they incite jealou&s;y
<PB N="160" REF="174">by means of peculiar di&s;tinctions. The command of the&s;e &s;mall bodies they confer on devoted men alone, and the better to &s;ecure their fidelity, they e&s;tabli&s;h in every body &s;everal degrees of command, which officers are promoted to &s;lowly by rotation, and rapidly by preferment. Hence every &s;ubaltern officer not only con&s;iders him who fills the next &s;uperior degree to his own as an ob&s;tacle to advancement, and looks upon him with a jealous eye: but the mo&s;t ambitious among them &s;eek to ri&s;e by fawning adulations, vile &s;ervices, and a&s;&s;iduity in courting the Prince; whil&s;t tho&s;e who are rai&s;ed labour to &s;ecure favour by a blind devotion to his commands.</P>
<P>In regard to the high military offices, great care is taken not to confer them on any darling of the peo|ple, and never to join them to any civil office. Di&s;|tru&s;t is &s;ometimes carried &s;o far as to place at the head of the army &s;oldiers of fortune only, to change fre|quently the general officers, to incite between them competition, to &s;et in&s;pectors over them, and never to allow the troops to be long &s;tationed in the &s;ame place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such is the craft of the Venetians.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When the Prince di&s;pen&s;es with commanding the army in per&s;on; in order to tru&s;t the command with|out danger into other hands, he gives it to &s;everal,

<P>AS the military are the in&s;truments de&s;tined to enlarge the Prince's authority, in order to pre|pare them to act again&s;t the people in a favourable juncture, they are &s;eparated from them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>I am not ignorant of what has been alledged again&s;t the quartering of &s;oldiers upon free &s;ubjects; but however grievous a burthen it may be to have &s;uch vicious gue&s;ts, I am far from a&s;&s;enting to the common opinion. The nui&s;ance complained of may be removed by enacting &s;evere laws again&s;t the encroachments and violences of &s;oldiers, by not authorizing them to demand for their groat a day more than is in the power of the landlord to afford, by commi&s;&s;ioning civil officers alone to billot them, and by enforcing them to do it in an impartial manner. On the con|trary,
<PB N="163" REF="177">to lodge the military in barracks, is at once to dive&s;t them of that little humanity which they pick up by conver&s;ing with the hone&s;t part of the world, to corrupt them the more by their abandoned inter|cour&s;e, and to qualify them for a military government. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the evil is accidental, but is unavoidable in the la&s;t; and &s;ince, from the criminal ambition of Princes, we are to undergo one or the other under pretence of common &s;afety, let us &s;ubmit to the lea&s;t of them.</P>
<P>When, in the reign of William III. admini&s;tration induced the commons to enact a law for quartering of &s;oldiers either in public or pri|vate hou&s;es, they knew not how favourable it would prove to their pro|jects to crowd &s;oldiers together in barracks: but this they have &s;ince learned from other powers. An attempt is now making to &s;eparate the &s;oldiery from the people. Already troopers, under pretence of keeping them near their riding hou&s;es, are quartered in a &s;ort of ob&s;cure barracks, till they may be quartered in proper ones; the progre&s;s is &s;low, but God forbid we &s;hould behold &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments with indifference.</P>
<PB N="162" REF="176"></NOTE>, quar|tered in barracks; and afterwards in&s;pired with contempt for every profe&s;&s;ion except their own. But to render them con&s;cious of their pre-eminence, many

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LVI.</HI> Of U&s;ury, Exactions, and Extortions.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a favourite maxim with the cabinet, that if the people are too rich, or even too much at ea&s;e, it will prove impo&s;&s;ible to keep them &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive; whil&s;t men rendered dependent by their wants, de&s;titute of the means of oppo&s;ing re&s;i&s;tance, and a&s;hamed of their poverty, are con&s;cious of their &s;ub|jection, and much more di&s;po&s;ed to obey<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Political Te&s;tament of the Cardinal of Richelieu.</NOTE>. Hence, far from relea&s;ing the people, Princes ever charge them with heavy taxes. But as if this did not &s;uffice, among the various means they have recour&s;e to, in order to impoveri&s;h their &s;ubjects, u&s;ury, exactions, and extortions are oftentimes made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>The Roman &s;enate, not &s;atisfied with levying the taxes, di&s;po&s;ing of the public money, and appropri|ating to them&s;elves the lands of the vanqui&s;hed ene|mies, u&s;ed to prey on the plebeians by u&s;ury.</P>
<P>Such was the craft of the antients, that of the mo|derns is much more refined: they borrow at large intere&s;t the money of the public; and the&s;e depo&s;i|tums of the fortunes of the &s;ubjects, like chains, tie the people two ways. On one &s;ide, they are a badge
<PB N="165" REF="179">of &s;ubjection, the &s;ubjects being ever afraid to furni&s;h a pretence for forfeiture from attempting to revolt: on the other &s;ide, they are arms in the hands of the Prince which enable him to cru&s;h tho&s;e who have tru&s;ted him therewith.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, when a favourable juncture offers, the Prince, either by retaining the intere&s;t for a long time, repaying the capital when the value of money is below par, or even by retaining the capital it&s;elf, reduces, by a &s;ingle &s;troke, his &s;ubjects to that point of mi&s;ery which they could not have been reduced to but gradually, by pur&s;uing the former plan.</P>
<P>In the&s;e points of view, public funds tru&s;ted to government in France, Spain, the kingdom of Naples, &amp;c. are to be con&s;idered.&mdash;A truth which tho&s;e peo|ple have but too often &s;adly experienced.</P>
<P>In England &s;uch &s;teps have never been taken, and perhaps never will; yet public loans bind us not the le&s;s &s;trongly: for by their means the government has intertwined it&s;elf with the property of the people, in &s;uch a manner that it is impo&s;&s;ible to lay the ax to the root of the former without de&s;troying the latter.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the government becomes debtor, tho&s;e who are creditors, made &s;en&s;ible that the &s;ums intru&s;ted are lo&s;t if government &s;ecurities fail, are ever ready to &s;ub&s;cribe fre&s;h ones, in order to furni&s;h it with
<PB N="166" REF="180">means for defending them. And this newly rai&s;ed money may be employed for a different purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>If to &s;ecure a fund for the payment of intere&s;t, any regulation de&s;tructive of liberty &s;hould be thought ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, the party concerned, that is, that part of the nation which is the mo&s;t regarded, would con&s;ent to it, rather than run the ri&s;k of being ruined by a &s;tate bankruptcy. If any one &s;hould treat this as a chimerical &s;uppo&s;ition, let them remem|ber the exci&s;e laws. Moreover, as by the negociation of loans, and the creation or management of funds, the intere&s;t of moneyed men is intimately connected with that of the court; not only the factors for admi|ni&s;tration and tho&s;e dealers in the funds, who, for the &s;ake of a lucrative &s;hare in &s;ome contract, are under mini&s;terial influence, turn courtiers, and cringe at levees, procure them&s;elves &s;eats in parliament, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Prince to en&s;lave their country; but the locu&s;t tribe of &s;ub&s;cribers, brokers, ticket-mongers, and all tho&s;e who act or &s;eek to act that dirty part, on all occa&s;ions appear the avowed advocates of every cor|rupt mini&s;ter, induce the timid, the weak, the fickle, the &s;ordid, and the indolent, to follow their example, furni&s;h their patron with a pretence to urge in excu&s;e of his mi&s;conduct, rai&s;es their clamours again&s;t the com|plaints of true patriots, &s;mother the voice of the nation,
<PB N="167" REF="181">and become a dangerous faction in &s;upport of tyranny.</P>
<P>Nor are even the&s;e the wor&s;t mea&s;ures that are planned by &s;ome Princes to ruin the people.</P>
<P>Sometimes, in order to impoveri&s;h their &s;ubjects and enrich them&s;elves, they deba&s;e the coin, that is, reduce its intrin&s;ic value without altering its current one.</P>
<P>At other times, they prey upon the &s;ubjects by the mo&s;t flagrant extortions; they even commit them to pri&s;on, in order to oblige them to recover their liberty by paying heavy ran&s;oms.</P>
<P>Thus having induced their &s;ubjects to contract many wants by encouraging luxury, it is the craft of Princes to deprive them afterwards of the means of indulging them, or rather to drive them from depen|dance to &s;ervitude.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LVII.</HI> To undermine the Supreme Authority.</HEAD>
<P>THE Prince, having &s;ecured the army, now labours to &s;ecure the legi&s;lature, or to render its power vain. When on the point of making any bold attempt, if he can do without the concurrence of the repre&s;entatives of the &s;overeign, he carefully ab&s;tains from calling them together. If their con|currence is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, they are not &s;uffered to proceed to any other tran&s;action, but that for which they have been a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>Charles V. having &s;ummoned the cortes of Ca&s;tile to meet at Compo&s;tella, engaged them to grant him a &s;ub&s;idy. With this grant, the cortes laid before the king a repre&s;entation of tho&s;e grievances whereof his people craved redre&s;s; but he having obtained from them all that he could expect, paid no attention to their petition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sandoval. 84.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such was the practice of Charles I. When he was in want of money, he a&s;&s;embled parliament, and hurried the bill for &s;ub&s;idies: then to prevent them from taking cognizance of the public grievances, he lulled them into &s;ecurity by fair promi&s;es, a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="169" REF="183">them that he would be ever careful to pre&s;erve the liberties of his people; engaged the &s;peaker to inter|rupt every debate foreign to the bill for &s;ub&s;idy, ex|pelled out of the hou&s;e the warme&s;t patriots, by inca|pacitating them from &s;erving as repre&s;entatives, or prorogued, if not di&s;&s;olved the parliament.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h their de&s;igns, Princes &s;ometimes again put in practice their former arts, they corrupt the legi&s;lature, and make it &s;peak as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>At other times they terrify the party in oppo&s;ition by threats, or they have the regi&s;ter of the votes altered.</P>
<P>It was by terror that Henry VIII. kept the parlia|ment &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his will. The members, free only in the &s;enate, were, as &s;oon as the &s;e&s;&s;ions was pro|rogued, left defencele&s;s to the mercy of this tyrant.</P>
<P>Charles I. intending to have an act pa&s;&s;ed in the parliament of Scotland, for the re&s;umption of tho&s;e church lands and titles, which had been alienated in the minority of the former reign, was careful to be pre&s;ent at the debate. But meeting with a great oppo&s;ition, he pulled out of his pocket a li&s;t of all the members that compo&s;ed the hou&s;e, adding, "Gentlemen, I have all your names on this paper, and I will know who will do me &s;ervice, and who will not, this day." Notwith&s;tanding the king's
<PB N="170" REF="184">threatenings, the bill was rejected by the majority; but the clerk of the regi&s;ter, who gathered the votes, removed this difficulty by declaring that it was carried in the affirmative<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Princes, in order to influence at will the legi&s;la|tive body, oftentimes endeavour to procure a choice of repre&s;entatives favourable to their de&s;igns. Thus Henry VIII. and Mary, when they de&s;ired to carry any important point, u&s;ed to write circular letters to the lord lieutenants in the counties, directing a pro|per choice of members<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mem. of Cramm. p. 344.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Actuated by the &s;ame views, James II. artfully re&s;umed the charters of all corporations in the king|dom, and granted them new ones, drawn up in &s;uch a form that it was in a manner left to the king to nominate the repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>If this &s;uffices not, Princes have &s;ometimes recour&s;e to another method. They &s;uffer none to fit in the &s;enate but tho&s;e who are known to have no virtue, after having excluded all others who are &s;u&s;pected to have any.</P>
<P>In the exigencies of affairs in 1656, a parliament was &s;ummoned, but Cromwell finding that the majo|rity of the members returned would be unfavourable to his intere&s;ts, placed guards at the doors of the
<PB N="171" REF="185">hou&s;e; and, under pretence of excluding men of corrupted principles, permitted none to enter but &s;uch as produced a warrant from his council.</P>
<P>Some Princes, in order that the legi&s;lature &s;hould be entirely at their di&s;po&s;al, have even by violence altered the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>In 1539, Charles V. demanded extraordinary &s;ub|&s;idies from the cortes of Ca&s;tile; but having vainly employed entreaties, promi&s;es, and threats, in order to obtain his demand, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly with indignation, and excluded out of the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies the nobles and prelates, under pretence that &s;uch as pay no part of the public taxes had no vote to claim in laying them on. Hence none were admitted to the cortes but the deputies of the towns, who being in too &s;mall a number, and too feeble to oppo&s;e the king, were all at his devotion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sandoval.

<P>Other Princes have divided the legi&s;lative body, and made the pro&s;tituted part pa&s;s for the whole.</P>
<P>During our civil war of 1641, Charles I. in order to abate the veneration paid to the patriotic repre&s;en|tatives, and avail him&s;elf of the name of the legi&s;la|ture, with a view of levying the &s;ums which were nece&s;&s;ary to carry on the war, &s;ummoned the parlia|ment at Oxford; and having collected there all the

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. LVIII.</HI> To u&s;urp Supreme Power.</HEAD>
<P>ARRIVED to this point, Princes eagerly con|&s;ummate their iniquitous de&s;igns. Earne&s;t to &s;ee the people their &s;laves, to reduce them to &s;ervi|tude, they oftentimes turn again&s;t them the con&s;titu|tion it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In a government wherein the activity of the legi&s;|lative power depends on the will of the executive one,
<PB N="173" REF="187">the legi&s;lature never can appear but when the Prince gives his orders, and never an&s;wer but when he inter|rogates them: in order, therefore, to annihilate their power, they are no longer called together. When once the legi&s;lature are &s;unk into oblivion, the Prince imperceptibly u&s;urps their functions: he ventures to i&s;&s;ue, by his own authority, &s;ome ordinances, at fir&s;t on trifling objects, afterwards on objects more impor|tant; he then by degrees repeats this practice, accu&s;|toms the people to that u&s;urpation of authority, and at length finds him&s;elf inve&s;ted with the power of enact|ing laws.</P>
<P>Thus the kings of France have u&s;urped &s;overeignty. At the origin of that monarchy, royal prerogative was limited to the executive power; the &s;upreme power re&s;ided in the general a&s;&s;emblies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e a&s;&s;emblies were denominated <HI>Champs de Mars</HI> or <HI>de May.</HI> See Pa&s;quier, Mezeray, le Pere Daniel, &amp;c.</NOTE> of the nation, which met annually at &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons, and in which every freeman had a right<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The antient annals of the Francs de&s;cribe the per&s;ons who were pre&s;ent at the a&s;&s;embly held A.

See the Capitular. collected by Baluze.</P>
<P>In the Capitulare, A.

D. 822, and 857.</NOTE>. Such was the French government under the monarchs of the fir&s;t race.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the power and &s;plendor which Charlemagne added to the crown by his conque&s;ts, the general a&s;&s;emblies of the nation continued to po&s;|&s;e&s;s exten&s;ive authority, under the kings of the &s;econd race. They determined which of the royal family &s;hould be placed on the throne: the Prince elected, con&s;ulted them regularly with re&s;pect to every affair of importance to the &s;tate, and without their con&s;ent no law was pa&s;&s;ed, and no new tax levied.</P>
<P>Under the degenerate po&s;terity of Charlemagne, royal authority was reduced almo&s;t to nothing. Every
<PB N="175" REF="189">baron had formed his lands into a &s;mall &s;tate almo&s;t independent of the king. The kingdom being thus broken into &s;o many &s;mall di&s;tricts, every one of which acknowledged a di&s;tinct lord, was governed by local cu&s;toms, and pur&s;ued &s;eparate intere&s;ts, hardly any common principle of union remained. Hence the general a&s;&s;emblies &s;carcely con&s;idering the nation as forming one body, could no longer enact common laws; and thus part of the legi&s;lative power was left inactive.</P>
<P>Under the de&s;cendants of Hugh Capet, the juri&s;|diction of the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies extended no further than to the impo&s;ition of new taxes, the determination of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown, and the &s;ettling the re|gency, when the preceeding monarch had not fixed it by his will.</P>
<P>It was left to the king to &s;ummon the national a&s;&s;emblies; but as the ordinary charges of government were &s;upported by the crown deme&s;ns, he called them together but &s;eldom, and only when he was com|pelled by his wants or his fears to have recour&s;e to their aid. Thus the obligation of &s;ummoning them regularly forming no e&s;&s;ential point of the con&s;titution, in order to render their power null, the Prince artfully avoided a&s;&s;embling them.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="190">When the functions of this power had been a long while &s;u&s;pended, the kings a&s;&s;umed them, but ventured at fir&s;t on acts of legi&s;lation with great re&s;erve, and took every precaution that could prevent the people from being alarmed at the exerci&s;e of a new power. Con|cealing their authority as much as they could, they began to i&s;&s;ue their ordinances, not in a tone of com|mand but of reque&s;t; they appeared to treat with their &s;ubjects, they pointed out what was be&s;t, and allured them to comply with it.</P>
<P>As the power of the crown extended, this humble &s;tile gave place to an imperious tone; and in the beginning of the fifteenth century the king openly a&s;&s;umed the &s;tile of a law-giver.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of the Capitularia collected by Baluze, was i&s;&s;ued in the year 921, under Charles the Simple. In the middle of the eleventh century, were publi&s;hed &s;ome royal ordinances, contained in the collection of Lauri&eacute;re; but the fir&s;t ordinance extending to the whole kingdom, and being, properly &s;peaking, an act of legi&s;lation, is that of Philip Augu&s;tus, i&s;&s;ued in the year 1190. The e&s;tabli&s;hments of St. Louis were not publi&s;hed as general laws to the whole kingdom, but as a code of laws, to be of authority within the crown domains only. The veneration of the people for this Prince procured this code a favourable recep|tion
<PB N="177" REF="191">throughout the whole kingdom, and contributed not a little to reconcile the nation to the u&s;urpation of the legi&s;lative authority. The people, accu&s;tomed to &s;ee their monarch, by his private authority, i&s;&s;ue ordinances in points of the greate&s;t importance, were not &s;urpri&s;ed when they &s;aw him i&s;&s;ue them for levy|ing &s;ub&s;idies for the &s;upport of the government. When Charles VII. and Louis XI. fir&s;t ventured to exerci&s;e this new power, the minds of the people were &s;o well prepared by the gradual incroachments of the crown, that it &s;carce gave ri&s;e to any murmur.</P>
<P>In proportion as kings continued to exerci&s;e acts of legi&s;lation, their &s;ubjects cea&s;ed to be &s;urpri&s;ed; they forgot at la&s;t that the crown had u&s;urped the legi&s;|lative authority: and at pre&s;ent the idea of this autho|rity having been ve&s;ted in the crown during every period of the monarchy, is &s;o univer&s;al in France, that any a&s;&s;ertion to the contrary would be deemed ab&s;urd.</P>

<P>The Venetians, weary of the long and tyrannic domination of their Prince, rea&s;&s;umed, in 1171, the reins of government. They continued, indeed, to elect a doge, but fixed &s;uch boundaries to his power, that &s;carce any thing was left him but a title. The &s;upreme authority re&s;ided in the people at large: however, as the concurrence of every one to every thing was impo&s;&s;ible, they transferred the &s;overeignty to a council compo&s;ed of 470 citizens, nominated by 12 electors; but that every one might have his turn, there was to be yearly a new election on St. Michael's day. The authority of this council was unbounded,
<PB N="180" REF="194">and by leaving it &s;o, the people were &s;oon reduced to &s;ubjection by their repre&s;entatives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>When the &s;overeign acts by deputies, unle&s;s their power be limited by the fundamental laws of the &s;tate, a &s;ingle attempt is oftentimes &s;uf|ficient to ruin liberty. In this re&s;pect, the Engli&s;h con&s;titution is extremely defective. Our repre&s;entatives are the guardians of our rights; they mu&s;t always defend, never attack them. But no boundaries have been fixed to their authority, in order to &s;ecure the con&s;titution again&s;t their attempts. They enter into no engagements with their con&s;tituents. After they are elected, they take their place in the &s;enate; and in&s;tead of con&s;idering them&s;elves only as the defenders of the con&s;titution, they believe them|&s;elves to be the arbiters of it; they have even altered it many times.</P>
<P>It was a fundamental law of the kingdom, that parliament &s;hould be held once every year, or more frequently, if nece&s;&s;ary. During the reign of Edward I. this law was confirmed, but afterwards altered. Under Henry VIII. the parliament pa&s;&s;ed an act for prolonging its duration to &s;even years. This act was made triennial under Charles I. Under Charles II. it was changed to an act for the a&s;&s;embling and hold|ing a parliament once in three years at lea&s;t, and again rendered &s;epten|nial in 1716. In every one of the&s;e acts of legi&s;lation, the parliament has overpa&s;&s;ed the boundaries of its power. The right of determining the frequency of elections and &s;e&s;&s;ions, unque&s;tionably belongs to the peo|ple at large, and to the people at large alone. For if the repre&s;entatives have a right to fix the duration of their commi&s;&s;ion to three or &s;even years, why not to extend it to fifteen, twenty, thirty, or rather to render it perpetual, that is to &s;ay, a right to render them&s;elves indepen|dant, to overturn the con&s;titution, to oppre&s;s their con&s;tituents, and reduce the nation to &s;lavery?</P>
<P>One might imagine that the fatal con&s;equences of this abu&s;e have e&s;caped and &s;till e&s;cape our notice, when, among our mo&s;t &s;pirited patriots, many incon&s;iderate men are at infinite pains by their frequent motions for
<PB N="181" REF="195">a triennial bill, to induce the people to acknowledge, as lawful, the authority of the parliament on that point.</P>
<P>What I &s;ay, on the frequency of elections, I &s;ay likewi&s;e on that of &s;e&s;&s;ions, and generally with re&s;pect to whatever belongs to the fundamen|tal laws of the &s;tate. With an unbounded power to redre&s;s public grievances, the repre&s;entatives of the people ought to have none to alter the con&s;titution, not even to render it perfect, without previou&s;ly taking the advice of the nation. Notwith&s;tanding the parliament have for a long time arrogated to them&s;elves the right of extending their authority in every point, this right mu&s;t be claimed by the people, and the utmo&s;t influence ought to be exerted in order to put them&s;elves in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. According as this point is gained or lo&s;t, we are free or &s;laves. As long as the power of our repre&s;entatives is not confined within proper limits, liberty may be enjoyed, but is not firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed; we have no other laws but the decrees of our deputies; thus ab&s;olute ma&s;ters of our birth-rights, they may &s;ubject us to the yoke, tyrannize over us, and forbid us even to complain.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay, that the legi&s;lature intends to make &s;o iniquitous an u&s;e of their power; but they can, when they plea&s;e, as long as their power is not reduced within proper bounds. But how is their power to be re|duced? The union of the people, not the &s;tep which ought to be taken, is the chief point to be attended to. However our mea&s;ures be planned, they will always prove &s;ucce&s;sful when we pur&s;ue them in concert, and we may do it, as &s;oon as willing.</P>
<P>When, under Henry VIII. the parliament pa&s;&s;ed the &s;eptennial act, under Charles I. the triennial act, and under Charles II. the act for a&s;&s;em|bling and holding of parliament once in three years at lea&s;t, the electors might be excu&s;ed for not having di&s;avowed their deputies; in tho&s;e times of di&s;cord and confu&s;ion, to re&s;cue the &s;tate from the brink of de&s;truc|tion was the only object in view: But at pre&s;ent, that &s;uper&s;tition no

<P>Let a Prince be diligent, re&s;olute, valiant, enter|pri&s;ing, and magnificent, no more is wanting; if di&s;graced by a thou&s;and vices, tho&s;e few good quali|ties are thought to be a &s;ufficient endowment.</P>

<P>Let us overlook the encomiums be&s;towed on Alex|ander, Cae&s;ar, Henry VIII. Charles V.; and from the many in&s;tances recorded in hi&s;tory, &s;elect that of Louis XIV. whom courtiers, poets, academicians, and hi&s;torians have &s;o greatly cried up, whom incon|&s;iderate men have &s;o &s;tupidly admired, but who&s;e memory good men ought to dete&s;t.</P>
<P>A good Prince ought to have con&s;tantly in view the welfare of his people; but, if the conduct of this monarch be attentively enquired into, it will appear, that during the whole cour&s;e of his long reign, he only &s;ought after what could be undertaken to his own glory: all his de&s;ires, all his di&s;cour&s;es, all his actions ever aimed at fame: and to this deplorable folly he continually &s;acrificed the happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of applying the public money to promote the true intere&s;ts of the nation, he di&s;tributed it to his creatures; &s;quandered it in fea&s;ts, balls, tourna|ments,

<P>To indulge his caprice, his pride, his wants ever new, not content with exhau&s;ting the produce of pa&s;t years, he de&s;troyed the promi&s;es of years to come, deeply involved the public in debt<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The debts he left at his death amounted to 200,000,000 pounds.

<P>Infatuated with a lu&s;t of power, he attempted to make all bow under him, cru&s;hed all tho&s;e who op|po&s;ed his will, and in order to &s;how how unbounded was his authority, exerted his tyrannic empire over even the minds of his people, and armed a ferocious

<P>Monarchs are &s;o accu&s;tomed to take advice in all public undertakings from their own pa&s;&s;ions only, and this abu&s;e is the &s;ource of &s;o many mi&s;eries, that the means of indulging &s;uch a fatal pre&s;umption cannot be too &s;oon wre&s;ted out of their hands.</P>
<P>The true glory of Princes is the enforcing obedi|ence to the laws, pre&s;erving the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, and promoting the public welfare: but for our mi&s;|fortune, and from our folly, it is not after this glory tho&s;e at the helm a&s;pire.</P>

<P>The con&s;titution of England is, no doubt, a monu|ment of political wi&s;dom, if compared to others; yet it is not &s;o perfect as we are plea&s;ed to affirm, nor can it be &s;o, con&s;idering its origin and its revolutions.

<P>As &s;oon as the&s;e concealed cau&s;es unfolded them|&s;elves, the kingdom was tore by dome&s;tic factions, remained expo&s;ed to foreign inva&s;ion, became the prey of an u&s;urper, and was reduced to the mo&s;t deplorable &s;ubjection by its rulers. Under our kings of the hou&s;es of Plantagenet, Tudor, and Stuart, de&s;|poti&s;m was attached to the monarchy. The di&s;pen&s;|ing power, the power of rendering arbitrary judg|ments, of impri&s;oning, of exacting forced loans and benevolences, of pre&s;&s;ing and quartering &s;oldiers, of erecting monopolies, were all exerci&s;ed in their turn.</P>
<P>Weary of groaning under oppre&s;&s;ion, we have &s;ometimes attempted to &s;hake off our yoke; but all
<PB N="196" REF="210">our mea&s;ures to recover liberty, far from being free national tran&s;actions, were mere acts of violence of the &s;tronge&s;t party.</P>
<P>During our civil di&s;&s;entions, every party, as it prevailed, has almo&s;t always been bu&s;y in cru&s;hing the others: and amid&s;t the in&s;olence of victory erected them&s;elves as the ma&s;ters of the nation.</P>
<P>Yet if ever the triumphing party &s;tipulated for common liberty; unable, in the tumult of arms and the public agitation of mind, to e&s;tabli&s;h it on a firm ba&s;is, in order to form a regular admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, they have applied only a palliative remedy to the mo&s;t urgent evils, and brought back the con&s;titu|tion to its fir&s;t principles, or nearer its primitive in&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>The only favourable juncture for &s;ecuring public liberty, was at the acce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Brun&s;|wick; as the triumphant part then formed a great majority in the nation, and the Prince<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In 1719, George I. propo&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h the freedom of the con|&s;titution by &s;ecuring that part which is the mo&s;t liable to abu&s;es&mdash;the limiting the prerogative of creating Peers; and that prerogative, &s;o de&s;tructive to liberty, and which the king was very willing to dive&s;t him&s;elf, was, again&s;t his will, pre&s;erved to the crown.</P></NOTE> was without ambitious de&s;igns; but this favourable juncture we let &s;lip.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="211">But I leave the con&s;ideration of defects which might have been reformed, for the examination of defects which &s;till remain.</P>
<P>In a well con&s;tituted government, the people at large is the real &s;overeign, to them belongs &s;upreme power: but among us the Prince has circum&s;cribed the boundaries of national<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the tenor of all the Charters, upon which our birth-rights are founded.</NOTE> liberties; whil&s;t the nation ought to have circum&s;cribed tho&s;e of royal prerogative.

Charles I. and Charles II. it was likewi&s;e in virtue of it that James II. rea&s;&s;umed the charters of the city of London, nay, tho&s;e of all the corporations in the kingdom.</P>
<P>Yet let a veil be drawn over this humiliating origin of our birth-rights. Thus emancipated, had we at lea&s;t recovered &s;overeignty: but we are &s;till no more than an emancipated people; in no national tran&s;actions does the parliament appear con&s;cious of their preemi|nence; in all their addre&s;&s;es to the throne, re&s;pecting affairs of public concern, they ever mention the king's
<PB N="198" REF="212">per&s;on and prerogative in the fir&s;t place; the reli|gion, the laws, and liberty of the kingdom ever in the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The repre&s;entatives of the people are admitted into the great council of the nation as tru&s;tees for the peo|ple, as well as councellors for the king; but in the oath of fidelity they take at their admi&s;&s;ion, they con&s;ider them&s;elves as the king's &s;ervants only <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I do promi&s;e and &s;wear to be faithful, and to bear a true allegiance to his Maje&s;ty.&mdash;So help me God.

<P>To the people at large only the legi&s;lative power ought to belong; this power they exerci&s;e either by them&s;elves or by repre&s;entatives: but among us one particular cla&s;s of &s;ubjects &s;hare that power indepen|dently of any con&s;titutive authority.

<P>To &s;uch exten&s;ive power are annexed high dig|nity, and many prerogatives equally oppre&s;&s;ive and

<P>The repre&s;entatives of the people ought to attend with diligence the duty of their office: but our

<P>As the people alone have a right to &s;elect their repre&s;entatives, they alone have a right to declare their choice, and to maintain it: but our deputies have arrogated to them&s;elves the e&s;&s;ential privilege of judging of returns, nay, of excluding &s;uch members as they object to, in &s;pite of their con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>Talents and virtue ought to be the only qualifica|tions required in repre&s;entatives of the people; and the man whom they grace, whatever be his rank or circum&s;tances, ought to be preferred to that honour|able office: but our deputies con&s;train their con&s;ti|tuents to &s;elect them from among a particular cla&s;s

I confe&s;s that tho&s;e ought to have the care of public affairs, who, <HI>ceteris paribus,</HI> have the large&s;t &s;take in public weal, becau&s;e the public have then, in the property of wealthy men, a &s;ecurity for their good conduct, which is wanting in men with|out fortune; but wealthy men are not always tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t concern for public &s;afety, and fortune alone is a very bad guarantee.

<P>The allurements tendered to virtue are not of &s;o palpable and &s;triking a kind as the baits of corrup|tion; and none but the wi&s;e and virtuous are greedy of them: men who&s;e whole merit con&s;i&s;ts in their for|tune, covet only to enlarge their e&s;tate at the expence of their honour, and the intere&s;t of their country; ever ready to join tho&s;e at the helm in mea&s;ures rui|nous to the people, as long as they find in it their own intere&s;t.&mdash;To &s;elect our repre&s;entatives from among

<P>Be&s;ides, from &s;uch an incon&s;iderate choice ever re&s;ults a partiality in the laws. When deputies exerci&s;e acts of legi&s;lation, they &s;eldom make any law which re&s;trains them&s;elves; and often make &s;uch as they may turn to their own advantage.

<P>To complain that the inferior cla&s;&s;es of the people receive no advantage from the laws relating to property (&s;ince being without fortune, they have no &s;hare in lucrative e&s;tabli&s;hments, and nothing to lo&s;e) would perhaps be deemed too great a pre&s;umption by tho&s;e opulent Sybarites who, from their elevation, look down with contempt upon the poor, whom they believe not made to &s;hare their plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Let us then overlook the advantages of &s;ociety, and confine our&s;elves to the pro&s;pect of its di&s;advantages. I &s;hall not mention here the hearth-money, the game|laws, and the heavy taxes laid on the nece&s;&s;aries of

<P>There are foundations for poor among us, it will be &s;aid: but what pen, eloquent enough, could de&s;cribe with propriety the &s;hocking &s;cene of a work|hou&s;e, or what man ever &s;o &s;avage could take a view of it without &s;haking with horror. Di&s;mal places! wherein the needy is kept alive by unwhole|&s;ome food, lays in na&s;tine&s;s, breathes an infected air, and groans under the &s;evere hand of a warden; wretched habitations! wherein abu&s;es, di&s;ea&s;es and hunger reign con&s;tantly. Of tho&s;e who are confined there, how many fall victims to their hard fate; and how few, rather than re-enter therein, unle&s;s com|pelled by intolerable nece&s;&s;ity, prefer not &s;tarving at the door of the rich?</P>
<P>The poor, almo&s;t entirely de&s;titute of a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t hunger, find as little again&s;t di&s;ea&s;e. Who does not know that letters of recommendation are nece&s;&s;ary among us, to be admitted into ho&s;pitals? Thus whil&s;t the door of them is ever open to the &s;ervants of
<PB N="210" REF="224">our gentry and nobility, it is almo&s;t con&s;tantly &s;hut again&s;t the needy, the un&s;upported, the friendle&s;s wretch.</P>
<P>Among the many di&s;mal and horrid &s;cenes of op|pre&s;&s;ion which, in our &s;o much exalted government, are but too often di&s;clo&s;ed re&s;pecting the poor, let one more &s;uffice.</P>
<P>"The injured member of &s;ociety, whom the jury acquit, or whom the villain by who&s;e machination he was confined dares not appear to pro&s;ecute, is dragged back to his dungeon, where he is again confined, without mercy, by the tyrant of the gaol, till he has paid what he demands of him under the &s;pecious denomination of fees;" thus unju&s;tly condemned to &s;uffer puni&s;hments which ought to be inflicted on profligate malefactors alone, and reduced, in the horrors of his mind, ince&s;&s;antly to cur&s;e the day of his birth.</P>
<P>A few, a very few, benevolent members, after hav|ing received intimation of the&s;e cruelties, have indeed &s;ometimes made a motion to enquire into the &s;tate of the gaols, but to no effect. The legi&s;lators, remote as they are from &s;uch a wretched condition, behold without concern tho&s;e abominable abu&s;es, and never think them worth being reformed. Who are the friends to the poor in a &s;enate compo&s;ed of rich men

<P>Be it again &s;aid, as long as the members that com|po&s;e the legi&s;lature are &s;elected from among one par|ticular cla&s;s of people, it mu&s;t never be expected to &s;ee them applying them&s;elves to promote common welfare: and like the parliament under Mary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 and 2 Philip and Mary, c. 6.</NOTE>, hav|ing &s;ecured their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, they will be uncon|cerned for all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But let us draw, with indignation, a veil over the&s;e my&s;teries of iniquity, to continue our examination.</P>
<P>Although at the mercy of our repre&s;entatives, yet we have much more to dread from our Prince.</P>
<P>Our forefathers, indeed, have taken much care to circum&s;cribe the prerogative of the crown, but not enought to curb its power.</P>

<PB N="213" REF="227">Was it the wi&s;dom of our con&s;titution, or even our virtue, that re&s;cued the &s;tate from the brink of de&s;truction?</P>
<P>But let us &s;uppo&s;e that what has once happened, never will happen again.</P>
<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament holds as long as the king plea&s;es, and we are too well acquainted with the u&s;e our Princes of the Stuart line made of this prerogative, not to dread the con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>The king has no legi&s;lative power, but can procure a legi&s;lature at his devotion, by his great influence in the election of repre&s;entatives. When a new parlia|ment is called, be&s;ides the votes procured by the money which is privately di&s;tributed for that purpo&s;e, the mini&s;ter di&s;po&s;es of all the votes of the trade&s;men who &s;erve his maje&s;ty in the &s;everal towns, and of all tho&s;e that placemen and other creatures of the court command in the &s;everal boroughs: The lord lieuten|ants, and other per&s;ons in authority, in the counties and towns, exert, moreover, all their intere&s;ts and addre&s;s to get &s;uch members cho&s;en as are favourable to the de&s;igns of the crown.</P>
<P>Not &s;atisfied with &s;ecret practices, the admini&s;tration even employs violence in order to fill the great council of the nation with court dependants. It is illegal to bring troops into the neighbourhood of an election;
<PB N="214" REF="228">but the mini&s;ter bya&s;&s;es the electors, by hiring a band of determinate villains to frighten them into a choice of a mini&s;terial candidate: and of what crime &s;oever &s;uch villains may be guilty, the Prince is not a&s;hamed to &s;creen them from puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>As the place-bill does not regard the upper hou&s;e, by creating peers of the realm &s;uch commoners as have greate&s;t influence in elections, and &s;ecuring the&s;e new peers, it is in the power of the court ever to command a majority in the lower hou&s;e.</P>
<P>If the king neglects to influence a choice of repre|&s;entatives; when they are cho&s;en, he may influence their re&s;olutions at his will.</P>
<P>The king has no deme&s;nes within the kingdom; but he is the fountain of all honours, and di&s;po&s;es of all places, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, civil, and military. Hence a great number of hirelings in parliament; this number he can ever increa&s;e, it being in his power to multiply places and offices: nay, by only augmenting the number of the officers of his hou&s;hold, he may di&s;po&s;e at his will of the whole &s;enate.</P>
<P>The place-bill, it is &s;aid, prevents in that re&s;pect the influence of the king, and is the great bulwark of parliamentary independence. A gro&s;s error this.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="229">Does a commi&s;&s;ion in the army, the navy, or the militia, vacate a &s;eat in parliament?

Suppo&s;e, however, that the place-bill incapacitates per&s;ons who have an office or place of profit under the king, or receive a pen|&s;ion from the crown, to &s;erve as a member of the hou&s;e of commons; does it incapacitate tho&s;e who receive marks of dignity or titles of honour, does it incapacitate tho&s;e who&s;e relations and friends have places of profit under the court, tho&s;e who receive &s;ecret douceurs, tho&s;e who are dependant on place|men and creatures of the court; does it regard the hou&s;e of peers, although it be well known that the lords di&s;po&s;e of a third part of the hou&s;e of commons?

<P>The commons nominate their &s;peaker, but their choice is void, unle&s;s approved by the king; and the influence of a &s;peaker on the proceedings and re&s;olves of the whole hou&s;e, is too well known, to con&s;ider this prerogative as of no con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Even the polity of the legi&s;lature is favourable to the views of the crown. In parliament, every mem|ber gives his vote openly: this method of voting is excellent it it&s;elf; but as the mini&s;ters are admitted into the &s;enate, it &s;erves but to force the corrupted members to become traitors to their country.</P>
<P>Although the king cannot call to an account the members for freedom of &s;peech in parliament; yet, if any of them, in giving full &s;cope to his patriotic zeal, drops a few incon&s;iderate expre&s;&s;ions, the crea|tures of the Prince exclaim again&s;t this want of con|&s;ideration for royal maje&s;ty, and cry out, <HI>The Tower, the Tower;</HI> on the contrary, if the hirelings retained by
<PB N="218" REF="232">the court di&s;play in their fawning &s;peeches the mo&s;t odious flatteries, they have nothing to fear but the bitter &s;miles of the friends of liberty.</P>
<P>When the commons have di&s;regarded their duty, was there ever found any virtue among the lords? But we know too much of their proceedings to turn on that &s;ide our fond hopes. Even in the mo&s;t critical junctures, and when the commons were &s;truggling again&s;t the incroachments of the crown under the Stuarts, the lords remained idle, and &s;eemed to &s;how little concern at the fears and jealou&s;ies expre&s;&s;ed by the people. Be&s;ides, there is in their hou&s;e a &s;acred tribe, ever blindly devoted from principle to the court.</P>
<P>However, &s;uppo&s;ing there were in the upper hou&s;e many virtuous members, as the place-bill does not regard it, by making new peers, the court may always &s;ecure a majority, as has been oftentimes the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lature is indeed a check upon the crown; yet only when it is intirely independent. For as &s;oon as &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;ted views prevail among its members, the parliament&mdash;the &s;trength and glory of Britain, turns a profligate faction, who, partaking of the Prince's bounty, and hoping to &s;hare with him the &s;poils of their country, join tho&s;e at the helm in their
<PB N="219" REF="233">criminal de&s;igns, and &s;upport their de&s;tructive mea|&s;ures; &mdash;a band of di&s;gui&s;ed traitors, who, under the name of guardians, traffic away the national intere&s;t and the rights of a free-born people.</P>
<P>A King of England will ever endeavour to make his progre&s;s to ab&s;olute empire by a pen&s;ionary par|liament. I have &s;hewn what con&s;idence the people may place in the great council of the nation, as long as our &s;o much exalted con&s;titution &s;hall remain as it is. Under Charles II. the parliament was filled with a band of abject pen&s;ioners, and the nation wept at the &s;ight of their &s;enators clothed with the badges of &s;lavery: what once was &s;een, may be &s;een again; alas, is it not in &s;ome &s;ort already the ca&s;e? Peru&s;e the li&s;t of the hou&s;e of commons, and you will find it chiefly compo&s;ed of men who have offices, or places of profit under the king. Nor is even this the wor&s;t of the di&s;mal pro&s;pect which lies before us.</P>
<P>The king has no right to lay any tax, but the crown has the prerogative of di&s;po&s;ing of the public money, when depo&s;ited in an aggregated fund in the trea&s;ury. To prevent the mi&s;application of public revenue, it has been re&s;olved to allow out of it &s;eparate incomes for the &s;upport of the government, and the mainte|nance of the crown dignity; the re&s;t is under the
<PB N="220" REF="234">command of the parliament, and the commons exa|mine the current &s;ervice of each year. But as the &s;um allotted for &s;ecret &s;ervices has not been limited by law, a pretence of &s;quandering the nation's money is left to the mini&s;try, if not a &s;afe and ea&s;y mean of filling up the king's coffers, and enriching them&s;elves.</P>
<P>A warrant for paying money out of the trea&s;ury mu&s;t, indeed, go through the hands of proper officers; but the king nominates the&s;e officers, and removes them at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>To prevent abu&s;es, the commons have the right of inquiring into the di&s;po&s;al of public money; but this prerogative of the crown is liable to the controul of the hou&s;e, only when parliament is a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e has a right to call the great officers of the crown to an account; but with money which has been embezzled, the mini&s;ter can engage them not to take cognizance of his mi&s;demeanor and plunder|ing. An enormous defect in our con&s;titution this, of which we had lately the &s;ad experience!</P>
<P>Royal prerogative is not circum&s;cribed here. The king alone has a right to make war, peace, and trea|ties, even without con&s;ulting the nation. Indepen|dently of that mon&s;trous abu&s;e of intru&s;ting a &s;ole individual with a power to &s;acrifice to his caprices the
<PB N="221" REF="235">blood of a multitude, of diverting the public attention in a critical juncture, evading the redre&s;s of national grievances, and making away with many trouble&s;ome patriots, by nominating them to perilous employ|ments; how many other inconveniencies!</P>
<P>The king's de&s;igns, when they have received the &s;anction of both hou&s;es, are ever carried into execution at the nation's expence: the &s;um they require may be employed again&s;t its de&s;tination: how many in&s;tances of this under Charles II.?</P>
<P>No war is made but a treaty follows, and few trea|ties are concluded without money. Thus when the Prince &s;ells to the enemy the fruits of national victo|ries, or to any power the weight of his influence on the affairs of Europe, the &s;ums remitted remain in his hands; but the charges of ill &s;ucce&s;s are always placed to the account of the public<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Did not James I. receive 2,728,000 florins for the ran&s;om of the towns that the Dutch had pawned to Elizabeth for 8,000,000 of florins borrowed of the nation.</P>

A due balance of independency in the &s;eve|ral parts of a con&s;titution is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;tability: but in the con&s;titution of England, the royal prerogative &s;o much overbalances the re&s;t, that when a &s;ubtle audacious enterprizing Prince &s;hall a&s;cend the throne, the government will be &s;ubverted.</P>

<P>The &s;oldiers are patriots, it is objected, the officers are men of honour, and tho&s;e at the head of the army, men of great property. What an objection this! <HI>The &s;oldiers are patriots;</HI> but they are rai&s;ed out of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;itous, the mo&s;t ignorant, the mo&s;t vicious part of the nation. What tru&s;t can be placed in &s;uch an abandoned race, whom idlene&s;s, debauch|ery, or crimes have driven to enli&s;t for bread? Is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that mercenaries who &s;ell them&s;elves for &s;ix-pence a day, would not be ready to obey any command of a Prince, who &s;hould flatter them with the hope of rendering their condition comfortable with the &s;poils of the citizens?</P>
<P><HI>The officers are men of honour.</HI> Such among them who &s;hould prove incorruptible, might be removed; yet how few would refu&s;e to purcha&s;e the &s;miles of a court at the expence of public liberty, and prefer
<PB N="223" REF="237">duty to favour, riches, and dignities? Be&s;ides, when once the &s;oldiers are &s;ecured, what is more ea&s;y than making officers?</P>
<P><HI>Tho&s;e at the head of the army are men of great pro|perty.</HI> Well, were they not men of property who, at the head of armies, have joined with Princes to reduce the people to &s;ubjection?</P>
<P>Were they not men of property who, at the head of the army of Charles I. attempted to en&s;lave the nation?</P>
<P>Are they not men of property who, at the head of the army, keep their fellow &s;ubjects in foreign coun|tries &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the government?</P>
<P>If the Prince &s;hould begin by be&s;towing on officers dazzling tokens of favour, is it to be imagined that they would refu&s;e pre&s;ent profit from a fear of future di&s;advantage?</P>
<P>If the power of the crown be formidable to the people at large, it is much more &s;o to individuals.</P>
<P>A mini&s;ter can, when he plea&s;es, have per&s;ons arbi|trarily &s;eized, together with their papers and books, or oppre&s;s them other ways: but when a plaintiff brings an action again&s;t a mini&s;ter, how difficult for him to obtain ju&s;tice! Although we boa&s;t of having the be&s;t dige&s;ted and mo&s;t excellent body of laws, which any nation on the face of the globe could ever
<PB N="224" REF="238">po&s;&s;e&s;s; yet our laws are &s;o prodigiou&s;ly multiplied, and many of them &s;o inaccurate, &s;o ob&s;cure, that the &s;ubtle politics of a je&s;ui&s;tical mini&s;try may very often evade the letter of them. Whenever the crown has incroached upon the &s;ubjects, in how many im|portant points has the matter entirely re&s;ted upon the opinion of the judges? But how clear and indi&s;pu|table &s;oever the claim of the plaintiff may be; be&s;ides the &s;ecret dealings of the government to &s;upport their arbitrary proceedings, how many means are employed to avoid trying the legality of their proceedings? Ca&s;ting e&s;&s;oigns, pleading privilege, &s;tanding out in contempt of the court, evading the judgment by bills of exception, &s;pecial verdicts, motions for a new trial, writs of error, &amp;c. are all made u&s;e of in their turn. Thus they prevent the cau&s;e being finally decided, by delaying until the poor pro&s;ecutor be overborn, in the long run, by dint of expence, or until an acci|dental event, if not &s;ome dark expedient deprive him of any further need of a court of ju&s;tice. However, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be as ea&s;y as it is difficult, to obtain redre&s;s, the arbitrary proceedings of the government, although condemned, are but little, if the lea&s;t, re&s;trained. Let the encroachments of a mini&s;ter be ever &s;o outrageous, in&s;tead of meeting with a ju&s;t retaliation, or having a &s;evere cen&s;ure pa&s;&s;ed on
<PB N="225" REF="239">him; the puni&s;hment he &s;uffers is but apparent, for the only &s;atisfaction that the injured party can pre|tend to is damages, which are ever defrayed at the public expence. Thus admini&s;tration, having trampled under foot the rights of the &s;ubjects, mocks the &s;word of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The&s;e are enormous defects in our con&s;titution, and more than &s;ufficient to ruin liberty: yet how many more remain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Add to the foregoing, that the Prince actually on the throne, is of him&s;elf powerful, and keeps on foot in his electorate a large body of troops, which, without ob&s;tacle, might be embarked for the&s;e his domi|nions.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>We have laws, it is perpetually objected: but of what u&s;e are laws, the execution of which we have no power to &s;ecure?</P>
<P>Did they prevent Edward II. from tyrannically exerting the pretended prerogative of the crown; &s;uch as the di&s;pen&s;ing power, the exten&s;ion of the fore&s;ts, the erecting monopolies, the exacting of loans, the &s;topping of ju&s;tice by particular warrants, the re|newal of the commi&s;&s;ion of the trail-baton, the extend|ing the authority of the privy council and &s;tar-cham|ber to the deci&s;ion of private cau&s;es<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Cotton's Abridg.</NOTE>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Did the great charter, &s;o many times &s;olemnly ratified, prevent the kings from violating it &s;o fre|quently and &s;o flagrantly?</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="240">Did the petition of rights re&s;train Charles I. from levying &s;hip-money, exacting of loans, and governing his people with a tyrannical &s;way?</P>
<P>Did all our laws prevent Charles II. from en&s;laving the nation? And whil&s;t we were groaning under the oppre&s;&s;ive hand of James II. was it not accidentally that liberty &s;prung up from its ruins? If the audacity alone of &s;ome of our Princes proved &s;ufficient to &s;ubject us to &s;ervitude; how much more &s;o when aided by refined artifice? Times have changed, I allow, but the con&s;titution is much the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Be it &s;aid, therefore, notwith&s;tanding all tho&s;e en|comiums be&s;towed on our con&s;titution, liberty is precarious among us, it depends on the want of genius and audacity of our Princes, and chiefly on that &s;pirit of independency which prevails in the&s;e times all over the nation.</P>
<P>As long as this &s;pirit &s;hall prevail, liberty may be enjoyed; we are undone as &s;oon as it becomes extinct.</P>

<P>THE incon&s;iderate vanity of the &s;ubjects, like|wi&s;e, gives way to tyranny.</P>
<P>At the death of a de&s;pot, the only in&s;tant when &s;ubjects might di&s;play their true &s;entiments, in&s;tead of acclamations, they wear mourning as courtiers.</P>
<P>What hence? will it be &s;aid. Alas, is it not &s;elf-evident enough! By that incon&s;iderate vanity, you have deprived your&s;elves of the only mean which re|mained of being openly revenged of a bad Prince, and the only mean of honouring the memory of a good one; for if you di&s;play &s;uch marks of re&s;pect for a Tiberius, a Louis XI. a Henry VIII. what remains for a Marcus Aurelius, a Louis IX. a Henry V.?</P>
<P>By that incon&s;iderate vanity, you have wre&s;ted from your own hands the only rod which remained to repre&s;s the audacity of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown, the only reward to encourage him to the pur&s;uit of virtue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the Princes who mounted the Egyptian throne, how many turned virtuous, from the con&s;ideration alone that &s;epulture was refu&s;ed to a bad one.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>By &s;uch incon&s;iderate marks of re&s;pect, you have confounded the real relations of things. For the lo&s;s of a Prince who could &s;carce li&s;p, the whole &s;tate a&s;&s;umes a melancholy face, all is mournful, fea&s;ts cea&s;e, places of public entertainment are &s;hut: whil&s;t for the lo&s;s of the benefactors of the patria, of tho&s;e who have defended it at the expence of their blood, of tho&s;e who have enriched it by their knowledge, of tho&s;e who have honoured it with their virtues, no marks of public grief are &s;een, fea&s;ts continue, and all appear gay. Nay, when an allied Prince dies, the &s;ubjects, imitating the court, wear black, whil&s;t in tho&s;e public calamities, when the plague lays wa&s;te the provinces, when the fire of heaven con&s;umes the cities, when famine drives to de&s;pair u&s;eful labourers, no mourning, no public marks of affliction are &s;een.</P>
<P>In fine, from that &s;ervile &s;pirit, Princes proceed to enforce, as a duty, tho&s;e exterior marks of veneration; and e&s;tabli&s;hing their tyrannic empire in our very hearts, they command us to bemoan when they bemoan, and to laugh when they laugh.</P>
<P>Henceforth political relations are &s;ubverted; the Prince is all, the Nation nothing.</P>

<P>IN order to obtain their demand, it is the con&s;tant practice of tho&s;e who &s;olicit any favour from Princes, to tell them, they have a boundle&s;s power, as God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In order to &s;hare their authority, it is likewi&s;e the con&s;tant cu&s;tom of the mini&s;ter to tell them that they are ab&s;olute, that every thing mu&s;t yield to their will, that they may di&s;po&s;e of the fortune of their &s;ubjects, and that every mea&s;ure to render their power irre&s;i&s;t|able, is permitted when well planned, or attended with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<P>By continually hearing that Princes are ab&s;olute, the people at la&s;t believe it.

<P>THE people not only &s;uffer them&s;elves to be enchained, but oftentimes offer their necks to the yoke.</P>
<P>When a crafty man gains their confidence, he in&s;pires them with what &s;entiment he plea&s;es, and ma&s;ters them at will.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="246">Having a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the ob&s;equies of Cae&s;ar, Antony a&s;cends the ro&s;tra, and holding the bloody gown of the emperor, moves the populace; who in&s;tantly ran with the torches of the funeral pile in their hands to &s;et on fire the hou&s;es of Ca&s;&s;ius and Brutus.</P>
<P>But, con&s;idering what Mahomet, and other founders of &s;ects have done, what need is there for any ex|ample?</P>
<P>Not &s;atisfied with being dupes, the people run &s;ometimes to &s;ervitude, and lend their own hands to forge their chains. Never thinking that in a free coun|try, every &s;ubject has a right to inform again&s;t the &s;ervants of the public, they ever blindly abandon them|&s;elves to their zeal for tho&s;e who have appeared in their defence; and, yielding to gratitude, ever &s;trike at that very liberty, the defender of which they mean to vindicate.</P>
<P>As Timoleon, charged with mi&s;demeanors by &s;ome orators of Syracu&s;a, was &s;ummoned to appear before the people to clear him&s;elf, his fellow citizens were on the point of tearing his accu&s;ers to pieces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plutarch. in Vita Timoleon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In order to maintain them&s;elves free, the people ought never to &s;uffer the law to be made delu&s;ive; but they oftentimes ob&s;tinately violate it in favour of tho&s;e they re&s;pect. Zaleuchus, legi&s;lator of the Locrians, having enacted a &s;evere law again&s;t adultery, and his own
<PB N="233" REF="247">&s;on being &s;oon after convicted of that crime, the peo|ple moved by the paternal &s;orrow, repeatedly entreated his pardon.</P>
<P>How many times, with a view to &s;ecure their liberty, have the people tru&s;ted in the Prince's own hands a tyrannic &s;way? The per&s;ecutions of the Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects under Mary I. rendered her domination odious. Accordingly, when Elizabeth mounted the throne, as &s;he profe&s;&s;ed the reformed religion, the people, tran&s;ported by an indi&s;creet zeal, ve&s;ted her with an exten&s;ive power to extirpate papi&s;m; but the fear of religious per&s;ecutions was &s;oon changed into fear of civil &s;lavery, and the prote&s;tants with regret felt them&s;elves cru&s;hed under the weight of that power they had erected to cru&s;h their enemies.</P>
<P>Nay, in order to reform the government or vindicate the &s;tate, they have tru&s;ted a few individuals with an ab&s;olute power! Of this the Decemviri, Marius, and Sylla, are famous in&s;tances. Ve&s;ted with the whole power of the commonwealth, Rome beheld with a&s;toni&s;hment the authority it had intru&s;ted them with: in their pre&s;ence the people ca&s;t their eyes down, the laws laid in &s;ilence, the names of the pro&s;cribed re|&s;ounded every where, and blood was &s;hed in abun|dance.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="248">The Dutch, delivered from the domination of their ma&s;ter by the death of William II. again tru&s;ted the &s;upreme authority into the hands of his &s;on, murdered the zealous patriots who oppo&s;ed &s;uch a ra&s;h &s;tep, and again erected a Prince again&s;t liberty.</P>
<P>Have we not our&s;elves many times forged our chains? When the people, incen&s;ed by the tax of three groats impo&s;ed by Richard II. on every per&s;on, male or female, above fifteen years of age, had ri&s;en again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors, re&s;olutely bent to better their condi|tion; they required the abolition of &s;lavery, freedom of commerce in market-towns without tolls or im|po&s;ts, and a fixed rent on lands, in&s;tead of the &s;er|vices due by villenage. All the&s;e reque&s;ts were com|plied with, and charters to that purpo&s;e were granted them. Soon after the nobility and gentry, hearing of the&s;e tran&s;actions, flocked to London with their adhe|rents and retainers, Richard took the field, the char|ters of enfranchi&s;ement were revoked by parliament, and the inferior cla&s;s of people were reduced to the &s;ame &s;lavi&s;h condition as before<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. ii. cap. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The parliament, like a vile in&s;trument de&s;tined to enlarge royal authority, &s;ubjected the whole nation to Henry VIII. in the mo&s;t &s;candalous manner.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="249">At fir&s;t they conferred on the King the title of the only &s;upreme head on earth of the church of Eng|land, and inve&s;ted him with all the real power belong|ing to it, or rather, acknowledged his pretended inherent power "To vi&s;it, repre&s;s, redre&s;s, reform, correct, re&s;train, and amend all errors, here&s;ies, abu&s;es, offences, contempt, and enormities, which fall under any &s;piritual authority and juri&s;diction;" and, as if it was not enough to tru&s;t him with the&s;e terrible wea|pons, they pa&s;&s;ed a law by which they ratified all the tenets which the commi&s;&s;ion, appointed by the crown to chu&s;e a religion for the people, &s;hould e&s;ta|bli&s;h with the king's con&s;ent, not being a&s;hamed of expre&s;ly declaring that they had no other rule in reli|gious concerns but the arbitrary will of their ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Having thus re&s;igned all their eccle&s;ia&s;tical liberties, they proceeded to an entire &s;urrender of their civil rights; and, without &s;cruple or deliberation, made, by one act, a total &s;ubver&s;ion of the Engli&s;h con&s;titu|tion;&mdash;they gave to the king's proclamations the &s;ame force as to &s;tatutes enacted by parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">31 Hen.

But to prove the more ready to gratify even the mo&s;t lawle&s;s pa&s;|&s;ions of the King, they ratified his divorce from Anne Boleyn, declared the i&s;&s;ue of their marriage illegiti|mate, &s;ettled the crown on the king's i&s;&s;ue by his new mi&s;tre&s;s, and in ca&s;e he &s;hould die without children, empowered him, by his will or letters patent, to di&s;|po&s;e of the crown. Not &s;atisfied with this &s;candalous pro&s;titution to the will of the monarch, a &s;pecies of civil inqui&s;ition was e&s;tabli&s;hed over the kingdom. Whoever refu&s;ed to an&s;wer upon oath to any article of the act of &s;ettlement, was declared guilty of high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>But there are in our hi&s;tory other in&s;tances of ba&s;e|ne&s;s &s;till more humiliating.</P>
<P>When Charles II. was recalled to the crown, with what eagerne&s;s did every order of the people run to meet him, and endeavour to outvie each other in their a&s;&s;urance of loyalty!</P>
<P>The nobility, papi&s;ts, and tories, united in their in&s;ult over an a&s;&s;embly, who&s;e patriotic &s;pirit had hitherto foiled their combined efforts to reduce their country under the yoke of ancient tyranny, and celebrated the happy event. The pre&s;byterians, &s;tupidly imagining they were exulting in their own triumph, cordially joined their voice; the patriotic party them&s;elves,
<PB N="237" REF="251">giving up all tho&s;e liberties they had purcha&s;ed at the expence of their blood, imitated the crowd.</P>
<P>Every one was bu&s;y in removing whatever might offend the eyes of their new ma&s;ter: the arms of the commonwealth were pulled down, and tho&s;e of the King put up in their place; the Scotch colours taken at Dunbar and Worce&s;ter were removed, and the great &s;eals broken: whatever bore any &s;tamp of liberty, or revived any idea of independance, was de&s;troyed, and public thank&s;givings were ordered.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the Prince landed, but the people from every quarter of the kingdom flocked to him; the &s;enate of the nation threw them&s;elves at his feet; he entered the capital in pomp amid&s;t public acclamations; rejoicings and illuminations were &s;een every where, whil&s;t in the tran&s;ports of their joy, the &s;tupid multi|tude cur&s;ed the names of tho&s;e who had &s;o long de|prived them of a King, threw in the flames the &s;ad remains of the commonwealth, and racked their gro&s;s imaginations for invention to in&s;ult a government by who&s;e paternal regard they could only hope to have been emancipated from that abject &s;tate of &s;ervitude they were &s;ubject to.</P>
<P>Hardly was the Prince a&s;cended the throne, but the parliament deemed as the mo&s;t execrable rebels, the oppo&s;ers of Charles the Fir&s;t's u&s;urpations: they

By their order the bodies of Cromwell, Ireton, Brad&s;haw, and Pride, were taken out of their graves, drawn upon an hurdle to Tyburn, hanged there, and then buried under the gallows. By their order, the walls of Glouce&s;ter, Coventry, Northamp|ton, Leice&s;ter,&mdash;towns which had di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves by their zeal for parliament, were ra&s;ed to the ground.</P>
<P>Not &s;atisfied with re&s;toring Charles to his preroga|tive, the parliament proceeded to inve&s;t him with an unlimited power. Having &s;ettled on the King a greater revenue than that of his predece&s;&s;or, they pa&s;&s;ed an act declaring the right of di&s;po&s;ing of the militia and land forces to be in the king's hands only; recalled, at his de&s;ire, the triennial bill; enacted a law to prevent di&s;affected per&s;ons from being admitted into office, to have the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of corporations per|petuated in the hands of the creatures of the court, and to oblige all their officers to take a new oath of allegiance and &s;upremacy, declaring it unlawful, upon any pretence what&s;oever, to ri&s;e in arms again&s;t the king, or tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioned by him.</P>
<P>They ve&s;ted in the crown new prerogatives, and did not cea&s;e to enlarge its authority, till they them&s;elves,
<PB N="239" REF="253">cru&s;hed under the weight of that power they had erected, beheld with trembling the work of their own hands.</P>
<P>But, as if ever fated through want of knowledge or virtue to effect their own mi&s;ery, one idol was no &s;ooner fallen down, but our forefathers erected another, and adored it with greater devotion.</P>
<P>As James II. a&s;cended the throne, the parliament earne&s;tly cringed at his feet, and amid&s;t the &s;everal tokens of zeal they di&s;played for him, it was uncer|tain which of both hou&s;es was mo&s;t earne&s;t to run to &s;lavery. The lower hou&s;e voted that all the revenue enjoyed by the late King &s;hould be granted to his maje&s;ty during life; and thus &s;ettling upon him an immen&s;e revenue, enabled the crown to maintain an army and fleet without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the people, and &s;ubdue tho&s;e who &s;hould dare to oppo&s;e: whil&s;t the upper hou&s;e, at the reque&s;t of the attorney-general, entirely di&s;charged the earl of Danby, and the popi&s;h lords who, upon indictment, had been pri|&s;oners in the Tower for the plot, annulled their for|mer order<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the 19th of March, 1678.</NOTE>, and brought in a bill to rever&s;e the attainder of the vi&s;count Stafford in the year 1680.</P>
<P>On their &s;ide, all the magi&s;trates, judges, ju&s;tices of the peace, &s;erved the king his own way, and as if
<PB N="240" REF="254">tho&s;e who were appointed to hold the balance of ju&s;|tice would leave no right in the &s;tate, they gave it as their opinion, THAT THE LAWS OF ENGLAND ARE THE KING'S LAWS, AND THAT IT IS A PREROGATIVE OF THE CROWN TO DISPENSE WITH THEM.</P>
<P>The clergy of the church of England, likewi&s;e, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their devotion to the max|ims of the court. The pulpit every where refounded with the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience; and this doc|trine was &s;upported in the courts of ju&s;tice by the judges and lawyers to the utmo&s;t of their power.</P>
<P>At length, to render at once the King ab&s;olute, all the corporations in the kingdom made a general &s;urrender of their charters, and abandoned them&s;elves to his mercy.</P>
<P>Thus, except a few men of a &s;ound under&s;tanding, and exalted mind, the people are commonly compo&s;ed of &s;imple and timid per&s;ons, ever ready to accelerate their own &s;ervitude.</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as the Prince has u&s;urped the &s;upreme power, the object of all public undertakings is no more the welfare of the people, but the di&s;play of his authority, of the dignity of his crown, or the grati|fication of his pride and caprice. Hence he con|&s;iders the &s;tate as his patrimony, and the public money as his revenue; he &s;ells offices and dignities, traffics away towns, provinces, &s;ubjects, and di&s;po&s;es at plea|&s;ure of all the national forces.</P>
<P>If incen&s;ed at &s;uch outrages, the people utter aloud complaints, the Prince pulls off the ma&s;k, a&s;&s;umes the imperious &s;tile of a ma&s;ter, orders them to be &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and to their remon&s;trances an&s;wers, <HI>Such is our good plea&s;ure.</HI> If he meets with oppo&s;ition; he &s;peaks but of puni&s;hing the audacity of his ene|mies. Complaints are then u&s;ele&s;s, and as the Prince has &s;ecured his authority, whatever be his arbitrary mandates, there remains only pa&s;&s;ive obedience.</P>
<P>Already public liberty exi&s;ts no more, the Prince is all, and the nation nothing; however certain indi|viduals, corporations, or orders of people, &s;till retain
<PB N="242" REF="256">particular privileges, which &s;tand in his way, and as &s;o many barriers, confine his power within certain limits.</P>
<P>When once the legi&s;lative power is ve&s;ted in the crown, the Prince labours to become ab&s;olute, be|holds with concern the enemies of his iniquitous empire, and makes away with them: he &s;ees with a jealous eye tho&s;e who &s;till retain per&s;onal preeminences, and is earne&s;t to deprive them of their prerogatives; he re&s;trains the privileges of corporations, u&s;urps tho&s;e of towns, and adds oftentimes mockery to injury. Thus James II. having extorted from his &s;ubjects their charters, returned them thanks in a proclamation for the great confidence they had repo&s;ed in him; adding, that he, for that mark of honour, thought him&s;elf more than ordinarily obliged to continue as he had hitherto begun, to &s;hew the greate&s;t moderation and benignity in the exerci&s;e of &s;o great a tru&s;t.</P>
<P>When the Prince is arrived at this point, his ambi|tion has no limits; every day he ventures on new &s;teps towards extending his power; every day commits new outrages, and, if he continues to have recour&s;e to pretences, it is le&s;s from nece&s;&s;ity than &s;alving appear|ances.</P>

<P>THE Prince, having engro&s;&s;ed every power which can be exerted in government, would that he were ju&s;t; but woe to tho&s;e who dare &s;till to complain of his tyrannic empire. As he has &s;pared no crime to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;upreme power, he &s;pares none to maintain it. Thus, when once the chains of the people are forged, they are afterwards riveted, and riveted &s;o clo&s;e, that the fate of their liberty is &s;ealed for ever.</P>
<P>The la&s;t blow Princes &s;trike at liberty, is the over|turning the con&s;titution under colour of defending it, and the puni&s;hing as rebels tho&s;e who &s;hould attempt really to defend it.</P>
<P>Armed with the whole public force, inve&s;ted with all authority, and interpreters of the laws, they make of them an arm defen&s;ive and offen&s;ive, which renders them &s;acred to their &s;ubjects, and terrible to their enemies.</P>
<P>If in the courts of judicature, before which the unfortunate victims of his vengeance are dragged, there is &s;till a remain of humanity, they compo&s;e tribunals
<PB N="244" REF="258">of their creatures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such were the commi&s;&s;ion of trail-baton, the &s;tar-chamber, the high commi&s;&s;ion court, the council of York, the chambre ardente, &amp;c.</NOTE>: The &s;word of tyranny is &s;u&s;|pended over every head; and if any one dares to mur|mur, he is ma&s;&s;acred in an in&s;tant.

<P>But this appearance of ju&s;tice &s;oon vani&s;hes.

<P>Yet he does not begin by violent extortions; he at fir&s;t employs craft, and covering his wants with the exigencies of government, he lays heavy taxes on the &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>To the care of per&s;onal &s;afety, tyrants join that of &s;ecuring their empire, and their cruelty augments with their terrors.

Thus reduced to wi&s;h for a better condition, without daring to attempt any thing to re&s;cue the &s;ubjects from their mi&s;ery, and to applaud that which it would prove dangerous to blame, they, as the re&s;t, re&s;olve to be &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive.

<P><PB N="258" REF="272">Prompted by a dete&s;table pride, the tyrant adds oftentimes in&s;ult to outrage. Applauding him&s;elf that he in&s;pires terror, he walks in public places, where con&s;ternation preceeds him.

<P>In proportion as tyranny advances to its la&s;t period, the &s;ervility of the &s;ubjects proceeds to its lowe&s;t degree. How many, whil&s;t cru&s;hed under the weight of their yoke, are not &s;atisfied with ki&s;&s;|ing their chains, but become the vile&s;t apologi&s;ts of tyranny?</P>
<P>Nero having committed a horrid parricide, the citizens of Rome immediately flocked to the temples, to thank the gods for an action which demanded their vengeance: the &s;enators them&s;elves a&s;cended the capitol, ordered a thank&s;giving for the &s;afety of the Prince, placed the birth-day of his mother among the days of ill omen, and offered their incen&s;e for a

<P>But what exce&s;&s;es have not tyrants committed?&mdash; After they have engro&s;&s;ed whatever power mortal beings can engro&s;s, they affect to be more than men, they have the in&s;olent folly to pa&s;s for gods: and as if the abjection of the people would go beyond its own bounds, the&s;e &s;laves are heard conferring on the tyrant titles more pompous than he dares to a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>Such are commonly the &s;teps by which Princes advance to de&s;poti&s;m. Thus Liberty has the fate of all other human things: It yields to Time which de&s;troys every thing, to Vice which corrupts every thing, to Ignorance which confounds every thing, and to Force which cru&s;hes every thing.</P>
