<P>THE reader may perhaps think that there was no oc|ca&s;ion to give a new title to the&s;e Odes, the former denomination of Irregular being &s;ufficient. But, ever &s;ince the days of Cowley, Irregular Odes have had more preten&s;ions to the irregularity of chaos than to that of nature. The Author has therefore re&s;tored their an|cient name. When a title becomes a badge of indignity, it is &s;urely proper to refu&s;e it. Yet titles are neither here nor there.</P>
<P>The Italians, who alone of all modern nations feel what real poetry, what real painting, what real mu&s;ic are, have many productions of high &s;ame under this title. The flames would have received the following pieces, had not the Author known that they have more merit than many productions, which have the honour to attain the prai&s;e of tho&s;e who know nothing. But he pretends not to the exqui&s;ite &s;pirit of Poliziano.</P>
