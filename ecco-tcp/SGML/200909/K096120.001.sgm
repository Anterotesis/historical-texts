<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO a curious inqui&s;itive mind, not to have &s;ome know|ledge of the world we live in, is the greate&s;t morti|fication in nature; hence it is, that per&s;ons who have had a liberal education, have taken all the opportunities that fell in their way, of travelling into di&s;tant parts, even at a great expence; and hence it is, that &s;uch per&s;ons to whom the&s;e opportunities never occur, are eager to conver&s;e with travellers, and read their accounts with avidity and plea|&s;ure; but, &s;uch is the &s;canty and uncertain information they thus gather, and &s;o various and different are the accounts of different men, that little is to be depended on, and what is generally mo&s;t worth attention, is &s;eldom learnt. To &s;upply the&s;e defects, collections o&s; Voyages and Travels have at different times been publi&s;hed; but they have been &s;uch &s;e|parate accounts, &s;uch vague relations, and &s;uch detached journals, as have &s;welled tho&s;e works to a great number of very large, expen&s;ive volumes, that, in&s;tead of entertaining and in&s;tructing the reader, have confu&s;ed and tired him, and after the reading of months and years, have left him almo&s;t as little informed, and nearly as much in the dark, as when he fir&s;t &s;et out. To remove the&s;e objections, to
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
make a knowledge of thae Habitable World a plea&s;ing and an ea&s;y &s;tudy, and to open to mankind a view of nature, is the de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent publication. It is the Author's intent to blend the modern di&s;coveries, and the voyages and travels of late years, with tho&s;e of former ones; to compare the accounts of different writers, and a&s;certain the true ones; to omit all that is dry and unintere&s;ting in tho&s;e ac|counts, and retain only &s;uch information, as the generality of readers will wi&s;h to be acquainted with; and, to embel|li&s;h the pages with &s;uch a variety of Maps and Copper|plates, as will make the whole a very valuable publication. The Author's plan is, to begin with the countries &s;ituated about the North Pole, and trace them downwards to the South Pole; de&s;cribing in his way, the &s;everal countries of the known world, the natural hi&s;tory of tho&s;e countries, as far as is u&s;eful to a general reader, the manners, cu&s;toms, laws, religion, &amp;c. of the people. The&s;e will be faithfully &s;et forth from the printed accounts of travellers, publi&s;hed in different countries, with the authorities annexed, and the plates will con&s;i&s;t of maps, plans, and a diver&s;ity of intere&s;ting &s;ubjects; many of which mill be new, &s;uch as have never appeared in this country, and engraved in a &s;tile that mu&s;t give univer&s;al &s;atisfaction.</P>

<HEAD>A De&s;cription of GREENLAND. From the German of <HI>Crantz,</HI> (who was there in 1761 and 1762); and Others.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Country in general.</HEAD>
<P>GREENLAND is the remote&s;t tract of land in the north; it lies between Europe and America, and is commonly cla&s;&s;ed, by geographers, among tho&s;e northern countries, that remain unknown. As far as it has been di&s;covered, it has been found to reach, on the north-ea&s;t &s;ide, from the 59th degree, N. latitude, to the 80th; and, on the &s;ide oppo&s;ite North-America, to about the 70th degree.&mdash;It belongs to the crown of Denmark.</P>
<P>No &s;hip having as yet traced it to the mo&s;t north|ern parts, on account of the ice, it is not yet decided, whether it be an i&s;land, or not. From &s;ome late di&s;co|veries of the Ru&s;&s;ians, it does not appear to join on the ea&s;t with Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, or Tartary; but,
<PB N="6" REF="7">
is &s;uppo&s;ed to join America, on the north-we&s;t; be|cau&s;e the &s;ea that apparently parts them, and is called Davis's Streights, or Ba&s;&s;in's Bay, grows gradually nar|rower, as it approaches the 78th degree; and becau&s;e the coa&s;t, which ri&s;es very high towards that bay, falls lower and lower, the further north we go. The Green|landers, indeed, &s;ay (though it is doubtful how far they can be relied on), that Davis's Streight contracts it&s;elf &s;o much, as it tends northward, that they can travel on the ice, &s;o near to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, as to be able to make the inhabitants hear; but, that they can|not get acro&s;s, owing to the &s;trength of the current from the north.</P>
<P>Icelandic authors have de&s;cribed Old Greenland, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide, as crowded with churches and villages; and, they might have &s;aid the &s;ame of the we&s;tern &s;ide, oppo&s;ite to America; for, that the old Norwegians, or people of Norway, had hou&s;es and churches there al&s;o, is evident, from the many ve&s;tiges of them now to be found.</P>
<P>When &s;eamen &s;peak of Greenland, they generally mean the Dani&s;h i&s;lands of Spitzbergen, lying north of Lapland, between the 75th and 80th degrees of lati|tude, with the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Greenland, lying oppo&s;ite thereto. This ea&s;tern coa&s;t is but thinly, if at all, in|habited at pre&s;ent; but the we&s;tern &s;ide of Greenland, from the 62d to the 71&s;t degree, north, is again colo|nized
<PB N="7" REF="8">
by Europeans. The i&s;lands of Spitzbergen are uninhabited, except during the &s;ea&s;on of the whale|fi&s;hery. Some few Dutchmen were once left there a whole winter, but they all peri&s;hed. The globe is here &s;o round, that even at the di&s;tance of &s;ix miles, in a calm, &s;ailing ea&s;t or we&s;t, the ma&s;ts of a &s;hip only are di&s;coverable: at eight miles, no other part can be &s;een, than the top-ma&s;t; and, at 12 miles di&s;tance, the flag only; yet, the mountains of Spitzbergen, ri&s;e &s;o high, as to be &s;een 48 miles.&mdash;Lord <HI>Mulgrave,</HI> in his voyage to the north-pole, coa&s;ted round them.</P>
<P>The land, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of Greenland, is bar|ren, high and rocky, and rears its head, in mo&s;t places adjoining the ocean, in &s;uch lofty mountains, and in|acce&s;&s;ible cliffs, as may be &s;een at &s;ea, at the di&s;tance of 40 leagues. The cliffs and mountains being con|&s;tantly covered with ice and &s;now, the&s;e, by continually falling, have filled the vallies, and &s;eem, annually, to increa&s;e their height. The plains, between the rocks, are al&s;o covered with fro&s;t, except here and there a patch, where there is a &s;canty portion of earth and gra&s;s, an occa&s;ional little brook and pond, and &s;ome few, low, &s;cattered &s;hrubs.</P>
<P>Along the coa&s;ts, in Davis's Streights and Baffin's Bay, which is the &s;ea that divides Greenland from the northern coa&s;ts of America, there are numberle&s;s, deep, bays and creeks, that run up far within the land; and,
<PB N="8" REF="9">
the &s;hores are bordered with many i&s;lands of dif|ferent extent. To tho&s;e who have &s;een the Norway coa&s;t, we may &s;ay, this of Greenland is not un|like it; except, that the hills here are not cloathed with trees, nor the vallies enriched with herbage, and, that the mountains are every where high and pointed.</P>
<P>Within land, there are no inhabitants, and but very few upon the coa&s;t. The few there are, inhabit the &s;outhern parts from Statenhook, to the 62d degree; but, as no Europeans live there, the&s;e places are but little known to us.</P>
<P>Of the European &s;ettlements, the mo&s;t &s;outhern is the colony of <HI>Frederic</HI>'s <HI>Haab,</HI> or Frederic's Hope, &s;ituated in the 62d degree of north latitude, begun by the Danes, in 1742. It lies one mile and an half from the open &s;ea, and is a good haven, and place of trade. In the i&s;lands oppo&s;ite, where the Dutch merchant-&s;hips formerly harboured, many Greenlanders re&s;ide, being well &s;ituated for catching fi&s;h, &s;eals and rein-deer. This colony is yet but &s;mall. In 1754, it con&s;i&s;ted only of a factor, a Moravian mi&s;&s;ionary, and about &s;ix or eight European &s;ailors, three or four of whom were married to Greenland women.</P>
<P>Twelve leagues north of this colony, is that famous ice-glance, or &s;hining ice, called, in the charts,
<FIGURE>

<HEAD>EIS BLINCK.</HEAD>

<PB N="9" REF="11">
<HI>Eis-blink.</HI> It is a great, high field of ice, who&s;e glances in the air, re&s;embling the <HI>aurora borealis,</HI> may be &s;een at &s;ea for many leagues. It was an inlet within the land, who&s;e mouth is now blocked up in &s;uch a manner, by many huge pieces of ice, driven out by the ebb, that it forms, as it were, an arched ice-bridge, eight leagues in length, &s;tretching from land to land, and two in breadth. It has many open|ings, or irregular arches, from 14 to 40 yards in height, which might be pa&s;&s;ed through in boats, but, from the danger of pieces of ice often falling within. The&s;e, and many others that tumble from the adjoin|ing hills, are driven by the ebb, through the&s;e arches, into the &s;ea.&mdash;<HI>(See the plate.)</HI>&mdash;Such Greenlanders as wi&s;h to enter this harbour, carry their little canoes over land, upon their heads; and, when they have pa&s;&s;ed this bridge, they find open water, for 20 leagues in length, and two in breadth. Places are found here, where Greenland hou&s;es formerly &s;tood;&mdash; a proof, that the mouth of the harbour was once open.</P>
<P>About 36 leagues north of Frederic's Hope, is another colony, called <HI>Fi&s;cher</HI>'s <HI>fiorte,</HI> or, Fi&s;her's-bay, begun in 1754. Here the Moravians e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;econd mi&s;&s;ion, in 1758; but, as few Greenlanders live about this place, it has but little trade. In this neighbourhood, are &s;een many ruins; probably, the relicks of the old Norwegians.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12">A third colony, called <HI>Godhaab,</HI> or Good-hope, lies in 46 deg. 14 m. 36 leagues north of Fi&s;her's-bay. Here there are &s;ome hundreds of &s;mall i&s;lands, crowded together, in the compa&s;s of &s;ix leagues. The Moravians have here, al&s;o, e&s;tabli&s;hed a congre|gation, built a church, a provi&s;ion hou&s;e, a &s;mith's &s;hop, and a brew-hou&s;e; and the hou&s;es of the na|tives are &s;cattered round them. This is the olde&s;t colony in Greenland; having been founded in 1721. It was formerly inhabited by &s;ome thou&s;ands of Green|landers; but the &s;mall pox having made great ravage, in 1733, the number is &s;o decrea&s;ed, that there are now few natives here &s;ettled.&mdash;To give our readers &s;ome idea of the ravages the &s;mall pox made, it was calculated, in 1746, that, on the whole we&s;tern coa&s;t of Greenland, in the &s;pace of 400 leagues, there were not above 20,000 Greenlanders there &s;ettled; whereas, in the year 1730, the number was computed at 30,000.</P>
<P>Thirty leagues north of Good-hope, there are pretty large plats of gra&s;s, near the &s;ea-&s;ide; and wood is to be found.</P>
<P>In latitude 65 deg. 46 min. 56 leagues north of Good hope, is a fourth colony, founded in 1775. Trade here is pretty good, though there are but few Green|landers. This colony, and that of Good-hope, is frequented by one &s;hip only; and the trade con&s;i&s;ts of
<PB N="11" REF="13">
&s;eals, blubber, and the &s;kins of &s;eals and foxes. In this neighbourhood, are &s;everal &s;almon-fi&s;heries.</P>
<P>In the 67th degree of north latitude, is Wyde|bay, a fifth colony, e&s;tabli&s;hed for traffic and the whale-fi&s;hery, in 1759. This is one of the mo&s;t com|modious places for trade and re&s;idence, on the whole coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Sixteen leagues farther north, in 68 deg. lies another colony, called <HI>Egede</HI>'s-<HI>minde,</HI> or Egede's Memorial, erected in 1759. This place is frozen up all the win|ter; and is not open till May, when the whale-fi&s;hery is over.</P>
<P>A fourth colony, e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1734, lies in 79 deg. There are, al&s;o, three or four others: but the 12th, and farthe&s;t north, is in 71 deg. erected in 1758. We are told, by the natives, that the country is inhabited as far north as 78 deg. though very thinly; for, notwith|&s;tanding there is plenty of eider-fowls, white bears, &s;eals and whales, yet, owing to the long winter-nights, no one liked to live there long, the land being little el&s;e than dreary rock and ice. In the&s;e parts, in&s;tead of building their hou&s;es with wood and turf, as in more &s;outhern places, they are obliged to erect them with clay, &s;eal-&s;kins, and the horns of the unicorn-fi&s;h. According to their information, the land &s;tretches, north-we&s;t, towards America; and they tell us, that here and there are &s;tones
<PB N="12" REF="14">
&s;tanding erect, with arms extended, like our guide|po&s;ts, as if they were &s;et up, as directions for travelling thence to the northern parts of America.</P>
<P>We wi&s;h it was in our power to give the reader any tolerable account, on which he might rely, of the &s;tate of Greenland, &s;ome centuries back. The natives know nothing of their forefathers, but, that they extirpated their former, northern inhabitants.</P>
<P>According to the account of <HI>Arngrim Jonas,</HI> the learned Icelander, one <HI>Eric,</HI> a de&s;cendant of a Nor|wegian earl, being condemned to a three years bani&s;h|ment, &s;ought this place; and, finding it, returned to Iceland, and, the third year, per&s;waded people to go to his new-di&s;covered land, which he called Greenland; repre&s;enting it as a place abounding with pa&s;ture, wood and fi&s;h. <HI>Eric</HI> was followed by 25 &s;hips, full of peo|ple; and, in proce&s;s of time, greater numbers flocked there from Iceland and Norway, and &s;tocked the coun|try with inhabitants, both on the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;ide, till it was computed to be a third part as numerous as a Dani&s;h, epi&s;copal dioce&s;e.&mdash; Writers are not de|cided about the time of the&s;e events; but it &s;eems to be about the year 830.</P>
<P><HI>Torfoeus,</HI> the Icelander, who wrote in the 12th cen|tury, &s;peaks of a number of monkeries, and &s;ome nun|neries; and <HI>Theodore,</HI> who was a bi&s;hop in Iceland,
<PB N="13" REF="15">
in the la&s;t century, relates, that in <HI>Einar</HI>'s inlet, in la|titude 65 deg. &s;tood a great wood, where cattle were pa&s;tured, that belonged to the cathedral church at the end of the bay, near the village Gadar. In the great i&s;land Rin&s;ey, &s;ays he, is an exten&s;ive hunt of rein-deer, and al&s;o the be&s;t, &s;oft, ba&s;tard-marble, of which, the Greenlanders make pitchers and ve&s;&s;els, containing 10 or 12 barrels each, &s;o firm, as to endure fire. Fur|ther we&s;t, lies Long I&s;land, containing eight farms be|longing to the bi&s;hop's &s;ee. He makes mention al&s;o, of 19 bays, or inlets, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, round which &s;tood 190 villages, forming 12 pari&s;hes, be&s;ides a bi&s;hop's &s;eat, and two cloi&s;ters. <HI>Torfoeus</HI> de&s;cribes the air as more &s;erene and &s;ettled; and the cold not &s;o inten&s;e in Greenland, as in Iceland, and Norway. It is related, al&s;o, in the Dani&s;h records, that, in the year 1308, there was &s;uch a &s;torm of thunder and lightning, that a church was thrown down, many pinnacles of rocks torn off, and the du&s;t of the bro|ken &s;tones flew about like rain; and, that this &s;torm was followed by &s;uch a &s;evere winter, as they had ne|ver before &s;een, when the ice did not thaw for a whole year.</P>
<P>Their de&s;criptions of the fruitfulne&s;s, or produce of the land, are not only various, but contradictory. The Iceland annals &s;ometimes tell us, that it bore the be&s;t wheat; and, at others, that nothing would grow there for the cold. They &s;peak of woods where white bears
<PB N="14" REF="16">
were hunted; and mention oak-trees, that bore acorns as big as apples, and of a ta&s;te as plea&s;ant as che&s;nuts. We mention the&s;e accounts; but there is little in them, to be relied on.</P>
<P>In the Dani&s;h chronicle we are told, that, in 1023, the Greenlanders became tributary to the kings of Norway, which was &s;oon after they embraced the chri&s;tian faith, and that they were governed by a vice|roy, according to the laws of Iceland. We find no traces of their military &s;trength, either by land, or &s;ea. The Greenland trade, indeed, is &s;aid to have been very con&s;iderable; and, it may ea&s;ily be believed, that they exported a great deal of meat, butter, chee&s;e, fi&s;h, train and pelts; but the&s;e commodities &s;eem to have been fetched by foreign ve&s;&s;els, though navigation was not neglected by them; for they not only &s;ailed from Iceland and Norway to Greenland, in their own &s;hips, but the fir&s;t di&s;covery and navigation of North Ame|rica, is a&s;cribed to them; and, perhaps, a brief relation of this curious piece of hi&s;tory, will not be unentertain|ing. It is given by <HI>Mallet,</HI> in his <HI>Introduction a l'hi&s;toire de Denemarc;</HI> and by <HI>Pontoppidan,</HI> in his <HI>Hi&s;tory of Norway;</HI> tran&s;cribed by them from the Iceland hi&s;to|rians, <HI>Jonas</HI> and <HI>Torfoeus;</HI> confirmed by the te&s;timony of the ancient hi&s;toriographer, <HI>Adam Brementis,</HI> who wrote in the middle of the 11th century, and, con&s;e|quently, at the time of the di&s;covery.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">An Icelander, named <HI>Herjolf,</HI> went every year by &s;ea, to traffic, in &s;everal countries, accompanied by his &s;on, <HI>Bioern.</HI> Once, in the year 1001, they were &s;eparated from each other by a &s;torm, and <HI>Bioern,</HI> arriving in Norway, got intelligence that his father had &s;ailed to Greenland, a place then but little known; he accord|ingly followed him; but, being driven by another &s;torm, to the &s;outh-we&s;t, di&s;covered a flat, champaign country, overgrown with wood, and, on his return, de&s;cribed al&s;o an i&s;land. He did not make any &s;tay at either of the&s;e places; but, when the &s;torm cea&s;ed, made the be&s;t of his way north-we&s;t to Greenland. This di&s;covery be|ing made known, <HI>Leif,</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Eric,</HI> whom we have mentioned, ambitious of acquiring fame, like his fa|ther, by di&s;covering and colonizing new countries, fitted out a &s;hip, with 35 men, and went to &s;ea with <HI>Bioern.</HI> The fir&s;t land they made was &s;tony and barren; and they gave it the name of <HI>Helleland;</HI> that is, flat, bare land. They next di&s;covered a low country, with white &s;and, covered with &s;ome wood, which they called <HI>Mark|land,</HI> or level-land. Two days afterwards they &s;aw land again, who&s;e northern coa&s;t; was &s;heltered by an i&s;land. Here they found &s;hrubs bearing a &s;weet berry; and &s;ailed up a river, till they came to a lake, from which the river i&s;&s;ued. The air was mild, the &s;oil fruitful, and the river &s;warmed with all &s;orts of fi&s;hes, particularly large &s;almon. Having continued there the winter, and found that the &s;un ro&s;e about eight o'clock in the &s;horte&s;t days, it is evident, the place mu&s;t have
<PB N="16" REF="18">
been in the 49th deg. of latitude; and to be that of Newfoundland, or the river St. Lawrence, in Canada.</P>
<P>Having been long enough there to erect &s;ome huts, they mi&s;&s;ed a German mariner, whom, after a long &s;earch, they found in the wood, &s;kipping, and very merry. On being a&s;ked, what made him &s;o chearful, he replied, that he had met with and eaten &s;uch grapes, as people made wine of in his country. When <HI>Leif</HI> &s;aw and ta&s;ted the&s;e grapes, he called his new country, <HI>Viinland;</HI> that is, Wineland.</P>
<P>The en&s;uing &s;pring, they went back to Greenland. When <HI>Thorwald, Leif</HI>'s brother, with a view of carry|ing the di&s;coveries further, &s;ailed thither the &s;ame year, with <HI>Leif</HI>'s crew, and traced the land we&s;tward; and, the &s;ummer following, ea&s;tward. The coa&s;t was every where covered with timber-trees, and be&s;et with i&s;lands; but, as the &s;hip had received &s;ome damage, they were obliged to &s;pend mo&s;t of their time in repairing her.</P>
<P>Having repaired their ve&s;&s;el, they examined the ea&s;t &s;ide of the land, and perceived three, &s;mall boats, co|vered with &s;kins, and three men in each, all of whom, but one, they &s;eized, and wantonly put to death. Some little time after, a great number of the &s;ame kind of men, in their boats, a&s;&s;aulted them; but they defended them&s;elves &s;o well from their arrows, be|hind the boards with which their &s;hips were guarded,

They called the&s;e Indians, <HI>Sk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ellings,</HI> that is, dwarfs; and <HI>Jonas,</HI> writing after <HI>Myritius,</HI> calls them <HI>pygmaeos bicubitales;</HI> and &s;ays, they were found al&s;o on the we&s;t &s;ide of Greenland. He de&s;cribes the&s;e men as having &s;o little &s;trength, that there was nothing to fear from them; yet <HI>Thorwald,</HI> and he, alone, fell by one of their arrows. He ordered his people to &s;et up a cro&s;s at the head and foot of the grave (on which account that cape was called <HI>Kro&s;&s;a-ne&s;s</HI>); by which it appears, that <HI>Thorwald</HI> was a chri&s;tian, as well as his brother, <HI>Leif.</HI> The re&s;t of the Greenlanders, Icelanders, and e&s;pecially the Norwegians, that re&s;orted, from time to time, to Wineland, were probably heathens, who would rather live in a &s;trange land, than embrace the chri&s;|tian religion, which, at that time, was propagated in Norway, with &s;everity. <HI>Thorwald</HI>'s companions win|tered in Wineland; and, next &s;pring, returned to Greenland.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year, <HI>Thor&s;tein,</HI> the third &s;on of <HI>Eric,</HI> with his wife and children (in all 25 per&s;ons), &s;ailed for Wineland. His chief de&s;ign was to bring away his brother's body; but he was driven, by a &s;torm, on the we&s;t coa&s;t of Greenland, at a great di&s;tance from any of the Norwegian &s;ettlements. There he took up his winter-quarters; but, he and his followers, lo&s;t their lives, by an epidemic &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20">Settling a colony in Wineland, was, from this time, more &s;eriou&s;ly thought of. An eminent Icelander, named <HI>Thorfein,</HI> married <HI>Thor&s;tein</HI>'s widow, and went, with her, and others, in number 65 men and five women to Wineland. They took with them all kinds of cattle, tools, &amp;c. and began to build and to plant. The Skraellings &s;oon found them out, and bartered with them, their &s;kins and their furs, de&s;irous of having &s;ome of their weapons in exchange; but <HI>Thorfein</HI> forbade it. One of them, however, &s;tole a battle-axe, and was &s;tupid enough to try it on his comrade; but his curio&s;ity having co&s;t the other his life, a third &s;eized the weapon, and ca&s;t it into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Three years after this, <HI>Thorfein</HI> returned to Green|land, and brought with him &s;uch valuable merchandize, that he excited in many a de&s;ire to &s;eek their fortune in Wineland; but, no further account of this country, worth mentioning, is to be met with, after the year 1121; that is, 100 years after its fir&s;t di&s;covery. It is probable, that tho&s;e Indians, at pre&s;ent about New|foundland, who are &s;o very different, in &s;hape and man|ner of living, from the other Americans, may be de&s;|cended from them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take this opportunity, &s;ays <HI>Crantz,</HI> to &s;peak of the extraction of our pre&s;ent Greenlanders, who were formerly called Skraellings.&mdash;The Greenlanders &s;ay, they were called, by the former, chri&s;tian inhabit|ants,
<PB N="19" REF="21">
<HI>Karallit,</HI> a name the E&s;kimaux Indians, or North|ern Americans, gave them&s;elves; and a term, which, according to their manner of pronunciation, may be turned into <HI>Skraelling.</HI></P>
<P>There being no &s;atisfactory foot&s;teps of Greenland's having been inhabited before the arrival of the Nor|wegians, the mo&s;t probable &s;uppo&s;ition is, that the pre|&s;ent &s;avages fir&s;t came to Greenland, in the fourteenth century, and that their route was not from the ea&s;t out of Europe, but from the we&s;t out of Greenland; for the natives of Greenland bear no re&s;emblance to the Laplanders, or the people of Spitzbergen, but re&s;em|ble mo&s;t the Kalmucks of Tartary, and, as there &s;eems to be no open pa&s;&s;age for &s;hipping, beyond 80 degrees north; for Lord <HI>Mulgrave,</HI> in his voyage to explore the parts about the north pole, could penetrate no further, in the &s;ummer months, than to about the 80th degree, all beyond appearing to be an exten&s;ive plain of ice, of an enormous thickne&s;s: the&s;e things con&s;i|dered, the Greenlanders mu&s;t have originated from the ea&s;tern parts of Tartary, through the northern parts of America; and, indeed, the language of the E&s;kimaux Indians, in Labrador, and the native Greenlanders, are &s;o much alike, as al&s;o their per&s;ons, cu&s;toms, manners, &amp;c. that it is &s;carce to be doubted, but that the Green|landers are a branch of the E&s;kimaux Indians, who fled either a-cro&s;s Davis's Streights, which are barely 60 leagues wide, or el&s;e-travelled up higher, to the top of
<PB N="20" REF="22">
Baffin's Bay; where, by the &s;tone guide-po&s;ts, it is &s;up|po&s;ed that the land joins. The narrowne&s;s of the chan|nel, between the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Tartary, and the &s;outhern coa&s;t of North-America, being only 13 leagues acro&s;s, favours this a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked, perhaps, what became of the Nor|wegians, who are allowed formerly to have inhabited Greenland. A plague, which raged in all the northern countries, in the year 1350, called the <HI>black death,</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to have made great ravage in Greenland; and many corroborating circum&s;tances evince, that tho&s;e who &s;urvived this pe&s;tilence, were &s;laughtered by the &s;avage Skraellings.</P>

<P>AS the land is covered almo&s;t every where with ice and &s;now, all the year round; &s;o is the &s;ea, in which are a variety of ice-mountains, or pieces of float|ing ice, of &s;tupendous magnitude and form, &s;ome of them wearing the appearance of a church, or ca&s;tle, with &s;quare, or pointed turrets; others, re&s;embling a &s;hip in full &s;ail; others again, large i&s;lands, with plains, val|lies and hills, rearing their heads 200 yards above the level of the ocean.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">This ice, like gla&s;s, is, for the mo&s;t part, hard, clear, and tran&s;parent; &s;ome pieces of a pale, green colour; others, of a &s;ky blue; &s;ome grey, and others black. In many places, they are an ob&s;truction to the navigation: in others, during the whale fi&s;hery, &s;eamen moor their &s;hips to them, and, on their flat &s;urfaces, frequently unload their train-barrels. As in &s;ailing through the&s;e &s;eas, the ice mountains can be avoided, they are at|tended with no great danger: the flat, driving ice, how|ever, is terrible, Greenlanders a&s;&s;ure us, that, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of this country, tracts of ice have been &s;een 200 leagues long, and, in many parts, from 60 to 80 leagues broad, and three or four yards in thickne&s;s; and, that &s;uch pieces will float and drive with the winds and currents. Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n there is no opening made by the wind and &s;tream, one piece follows another &s;o clo&s;e, that a per&s;on may leap from one to another, without danger, and may plainly &s;ee the joints where they were broken off. Lord <HI>Mulgrave</HI> was &s;o hemmed in by the ice, that, at one time, he de&s;paired of getting his &s;hip out; and had ab&s;olutely determined to take to his boats, de&s;igning to draw them over the ice into more open water, and this in the month of Augu&s;t. Hence it ap|pears, that the Greenlanders are &s;o be&s;et, at certain &s;ea|&s;ons, as to find no pa&s;&s;age out; nor European &s;hips, any pa&s;&s;age in.</P>
<P>With this, and other great inconveniences, the wi&s;e Author of nature hath, however, combined a great be|nefit;
<PB N="22" REF="24">
for, though he hath denied this frigid and rocky region the growth of trees, and almo&s;t forbidden &s;hips to bring them any fuel, he has ordained, that the &s;treams of the ocean &s;hould convey to the&s;e inho&s;pitable &s;hores, a great deal of wood, which comes floating there, partly without ice, but chiefly with it, lodging it&s;elf between the i&s;lands. Were it not for this miraculous provi&s;ion, the Europeans there &s;ettled, would have no wood to burn; nor the Greenlanders (who burn oil in&s;tead of wood), any timber to roof their hou&s;es, build their boats, or &s;haft their arrows, which procure them food and cloathing. Among this wood brought here acci|dentally, are great trees, torn up by the roots; which, by driving up and down for years, da&s;hing and rubbing upon the ice, are quite bear of branches and bark, and corroded with great wood-worms. A &s;mall part of this drift-wood, are willows, alder and birch, driven from the bays in the &s;outh; and large trunks of a&s;pen-trees, which mu&s;t come from a great di&s;tance: but the great|e&s;t part, is pine and fir.</P>
<P>It is difficult to decide, from what country this wood proceeds: but it is &s;uppo&s;ed to come, with the ea&s;terly current, from Siberia, or A&s;iatic Tartary; where the trees mu&s;t be wa&s;hed down the mountains, by the wa|ters, which the rains and flood occa&s;ion, and brought away by the rapid &s;treams of their rivers.</P>

<P>THIS country being covered with everla&s;ting &s;now, it mu&s;t naturally be very cold and raw. In &s;uch places, in winter, where the inhabitants enjoy the &s;un for an hour or two in the day, the cold is tole|rable; but where the &s;un is entirely below the horizon, whil&s;t people are drinking tea, the emptied cup, when put down, will freeze to the table. <HI>Paul Egede,</HI> in his journal of January 7, 1738, &s;ays, that, in latitude 68 degrees, when he was there, the ice and hoar-fro&s;t, reached through the chimney to the &s;tove's mouth, without being thawed by the fire, even in the day|time; &s;o, that over the chimney was an arch of fro&s;t, with little holes, through which the &s;moke i&s;&s;ued. The door and walls of his room were, as if pla&s;tered over with ice; and, what is &s;carce credible, linen froze in the drawers, the beds were frozen to the bed&s;teads, and the eider-down coverlid and pillows became quite &s;tiff with fro&s;t, an inch thick, from the breath. They were obliged to hew their fle&s;h-barrels in pieces, to get out the meat; and, though they thawed it in &s;now, when it was put over the fire, the out&s;ide would be &s;ufficiently boiled, before the in&s;ide could be pierced with a knife.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="26">The &s;ummer, in Greenland, is from the beginning of May to the end of September; during which five months, the natives encamp in tents: yet the ground is not mellowed by a thorough thaw till June, and then, only on the &s;urface; nor does it cea&s;e &s;nowing till this time. In Augu&s;t it begins &s;nowing again; but no &s;now continues on the ground, till that which falls in October. The &s;now in Augu&s;t is either &s;oon di&s;|&s;olved by the &s;un, or di&s;per&s;ed by the wind; in which la&s;t ca&s;e, the wind &s;catters &s;uch a &s;ubtil, &s;now-du&s;t, that we &s;carce dare put our heads out of doors.</P>
<P>In the longe&s;t &s;ummer-days, particularly in &s;erene and clear weather, it is &s;o hot, that people are not only obliged to throw off their winter-garments, but on the &s;ea, the pitch will melt on the &s;hip's &s;ides. And, from April to Augu&s;t, the fogs are &s;o thick, almo&s;t every day, that people cannot &s;ee 40 yards before them. It has been often remarked, that the weather in Green|land, is ju&s;t the rever&s;e of what it is in Europe. In the year 1763, when it was &s;o remarkably cold through|out Europe, it was &s;o mild in Greenland, that it is often colder here in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>In general, the air is &s;o whole&s;ome and pure, that if a man cloaths him&s;elf warm, eats moderately, and takes good exerci&s;e, he will enjoy a good &s;tate of health and &s;pirits. The winds are as variable here as in other countries; but, when it once begins to be &s;tormy, which
<PB N="25" REF="27">
happens mo&s;tly in autumn, they rage &s;o vehemently, that the hou&s;es &s;hake and crack; tents, and the lighter boats, fly up into the air; and the &s;ea-water &s;catters about on the land, like &s;now-du&s;t. When any one is obliged to leave his hou&s;e, in order to put his boats into &s;helter, he mu&s;t creep upon his belly, le&s;t the wind &s;hould take him off his legs.</P>
<P>There is no night at all in this country, during the &s;ummer; beyond the 66th degree north, in the longe&s;t days, the &s;un does not &s;et; it &s;hines not, however, with &s;uch lu&s;tre, at night as at noon, re&s;embling only a very bright moon, which a man can look at, without being dazzled. On the other hand, the winter-nights are &s;o much the longer; and, in the 67th degree, the face of the &s;un is never &s;een above the horizon, from November 30 to January 12. And yet there are no dark nights here, as in other countries: the inhabit|ants enjoy a moderate twilight, and the moon and &s;tars, added to the &s;now and ice, give &s;uch a light, that peo|ple can do very well out of doors without a lanthorn, and &s;ee plainly to read print of a middle &s;ize. As, in the &s;horte&s;t days, &s;ometimes the moon never &s;ets; &s;o, little is &s;een of it in the &s;ummer-time; and the &s;tars never appear, from May to Augu&s;t.</P>

<P>THE reader may readily conclude, from the &s;ituation and nature of this country, what he is to expect, in regard to its fertility. Though the bodies of rocks near the &s;ea, yield a great deal of coar&s;e marble, and many of the hills a kind of a&s;be&s;tos, or &s;tone-flax, yet their &s;urface produces little. The vallies, in general, have no other herbage than mo&s;s, and &s;our moor-gra&s;s; and, the uninhabited i&s;lands, where the birds ne&s;t and dung, furni&s;h only a few, low &s;hrubs, heath, and herbs: the land, however, near the Green|land hou&s;es and encampments, from many years cul|tivation, with the blood and fat of &s;eals, though in it&s;elf, nothing but a barren &s;and, produces the fine&s;t herbs, in uncommon quantity and &s;ize.</P>
<P>Gra&s;s grows here, not only in fenny, &s;andy and turfy ground, where indeed it is, in general, very &s;hort and bad; but al&s;o, in the cliffs of rocks, where any earth has lodged; and e&s;pecially near the hou&s;es, where it grows very thick and long. Mo&s;s is the chief produce; of which, &s;ays <HI>Crantz,</HI> when I have been &s;itting on a rock, I have count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d near 20 &s;orts round me without ri&s;ing: one &s;ort is like a a &s;oft, thick fur, which the natives u&s;e as we do wa&s;te-paper, and al&s;o, to &s;top the
<PB N="27" REF="29">
crevices of their hou&s;es: another &s;ort &s;erves them for tinder, and wicks for lamps. They have al&s;o a kind of white mo&s;s, on which the rein-deer feed in winter; and which, in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, would pre&s;erve the life of a hungry man. There is another kind of mo&s;s, that &s;erves them in&s;tead of bread; being occa&s;ionally boiled with milk, as a &s;ub&s;titute for oatmeal. Europeans have &s;everal times attempted to grow barley and oats: the&s;e will &s;hoot up as fine and high as in our country, but &s;eldom get into ear; and never ripen, on account of the early fro&s;ts, even in the warme&s;t places. As the &s;ea&s;on will not admit of &s;owing, till the middle of June, they cannot rai&s;e many vegetables. Radi&s;hes grow as well here as in mo&s;t other countries; but &s;allad and cole are very &s;mall, and will not bear tran&s;planting.</P>
<P>Whortleberries and cranberries are here met with; and a fruit like the mulberry, only yellow, in&s;tead of red: the&s;e la&s;t are packed up and exported, are a very refre&s;hing delicacy, and a remedy for the &s;curvy. There are plenty of large juniper-berries, but held there in no e&s;timation. Of trees, there are three kinds of willows, but the cold will not &s;uffer them to rear their heads, obliging them to creep upon the ground. Their birch (though &s;omewhat different from ours), is in the &s;ame predicament. The Greenlanders talk of al|ders, that grow, in the &s;outhern parts, twice the height of a man, and as big round as his leg; and &s;ay, that the wild &s;ervice-tree grows there in abundance, and
<PB N="28" REF="30">
brings it's fruit to maturity. They al&s;o &s;peak of a wild pea, which they boil and eat; and mention a fruit, re&s;embling our large, yellow plumb, which they com|pare to oranges: but the further we go north, the more naked and &s;teril is the land; till, at la&s;t, nothing is to be met with, but bare rocks.</P>

<P>UNFRUITFUL, however, as this land is, it af|fords nouri&s;hment to &s;ome, though but very few, kinds of bea&s;ts, which &s;upply the natives with food and raiment. Hares and rein-deer they have in plenty; but more of the former than the latter. Hares are white, both in &s;ummer and winter; are pretty large, live on gra&s;s and white mo&s;s, but are little regarded by the natives.</P>
<P>Their rein-deer are of that northern kind, which are met with in Spitzberg, Siberia, Norway, Lapland, and the northern parts of America. They are here wild, and not ea&s;ily caught. The large&s;t are about the &s;ize of a two-year old h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r; their colour, brown, or grey, with white b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llies; their &s;kin very thick of hair, and above an inch long. Their antlers differ only from tho&s;e of the common buck, in being &s;mooth, grey, and
<PB N="29" REF="31">
broad as one's hand, at top. Their fle&s;h is tender, and well-ta&s;ted. They are very cleanly and contented creatures; live, in &s;ummer, on the tender gra&s;s they find in the vallies; and, in winter, on the white mo&s;s, which they dig for, under the &s;now, between the rocks. A Greenlander once caught a young one, bred it up, and it grew as tame as a cow; but, having done &s;ome mi&s;chief, he was obliged to kill it.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o foxes; but &s;omewhat different from tho&s;e of &s;outhern countries. Some are white, but, in general, they are blue, or grey: they bark, like a dog, and re&s;emble one about the head and feet; live on birds and their eggs, upon berries, mu&s;cles, crabs, and what the &s;ea ca&s;ts out. The natives catch them in traps; and, if in want of food, would rather eat them than hares. Blue fox-&s;kins are eagerly bought up by the factors.</P>
<P>White bears, &s;o often heard of, are frequently met with in all parts of Greenland: they have a long, nar|row head, like a dog, and are &s;aid to bark like one. Their hair is long, and as &s;oft as wool; their bodies are often three or four yards in length; their fle&s;h is white and fat, ta&s;tes like mutton, and the natives are very fond of it. They prowl, upon the flakes of ice, after &s;eals and dead whales; and will attack the &s;ea|lion, though this creature frequently ma&s;ters them. They will &s;wim from one piece of ice to another; and, when attacked, will defend them&s;elves even again&s;t a boat
<PB N="30" REF="32">
full of men. When on land, their food is birds and their eggs; and, if impelled by hunger, they will de|vour the human &s;pecies, digging dead bodies out of their graves. In winter, they immure them&s;elves in holes between the rocks, or bury them&s;elves in the &s;now, till the &s;un invites them abroad again; when, allured by the &s;cent of &s;eals' fle&s;h, they will hunt out a Green|lander's hou&s;e, break into it, and plunder it. The na|tives, in their turn, rai&s;e a hue and cry after the robbers, &s;urround them with their dogs, and kill them with lances and harpoons; though they often lo&s;e their own lives in the a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>Here are no tame bea&s;ts, except dogs of a middle &s;ize, which re&s;emble more a wolf than a dog, not bark|ing, but howling and growling. They are too &s;tupid an animal to be of much u&s;e in hunting; but are har|ne&s;&s;ed as hor&s;es to a &s;ledge, from four to ten at a time, in which the natives vi&s;it each other, or draw home their &s;eals over the ice. Their &s;kins are u&s;ed as co|verings to beds, and as ornamental borders to their garments.</P>
<P>Of land-birds, there is no great variety; becau&s;e there is little food for them. The principal, is the northern partridge; &s;uch as frequents cold countries, and the Alps. In Switzerland, they are called &s;now|hens. They ca&s;t their feathers twice a year. The colour of the cocks are grey in &s;ummer, and white in winter,
<PB N="31" REF="33">
the colour of the &s;now:&mdash;a wi&s;e precaution of Pro|vidence, to pre&s;erve them from birds of prey which hunt after them, and but for this circum&s;tance would readily find them. It is a good bird to eat, and ea&s;ily caught. Their claws have, within, a thick ball, covered with &s;mall feathers, to enable them to endure the cold; and, as their toes are not divided the whole way up, they are capable of &s;wimming. Here are al&s;o &s;nipes, and &s;ome &s;mall, &s;inging birds; and, of birds of prey, the great, dark-brown eagle, grey and &s;potted falcons, white owls, and ravens.</P>
<P>As to in&s;ects and vermin&mdash;the natives are troubled with large gnats (be&s;ides &s;mall ones), in &s;uch quan|tities, that in hazy, &s;ummer weather, it is difficult to &s;creen them&s;elves from them. They have all &s;orts of earth-worms and maggots; but nothing venemous, except &s;piders. No &s;erpents, toads, frogs, rats, mice, fleas, or &s;uch like animals. The&s;e cannot live in this cold country.</P>
<P>De&s;titute, however, as the land is of living creatures, the riches of the &s;ea make it up, as well in variety as multitude. The many kinds of &s;ea-fowls are too nu|merous to mention here; unle&s;s we were writing the natural hi&s;tory of the place. Indeed, they are not peculiar to Greenland, but are found in mo&s;t of the higher latitudes. We &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of &s;ome of them, when we are de&s;cribing Norway; will,
<PB N="32" REF="34">
therefore, pa&s;s over all but the eider-fowl, or black duck, it's down being a profitable article of commerce. It's fle&s;h is eaten by the Greenlanders; and, of it's &s;kin, they make their fine&s;t, and their warme&s;t, under-gar|ments. This fowl is, however, mo&s;t celebrated for it's valuable down, which is found in great quantities, when &s;tripped of it's coar&s;e feathers. As the down, when pulled from the dead bird, is apt to heat by lying, and will not &s;well and di&s;tend it&s;elf rightly, they con|trive to procure it from the fowl whil&s;t living: for this purpo&s;e, they vi&s;it the ne&s;ts, which the tender mother lines with this &s;oft &s;ub&s;tance, either dropped, or pluck|ed from her body, to prepare a warm bed for her cal|low brood. Of this down, we have warm, light cover|lids, in England; but we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more of it hereafter.</P>
<P>Of the mo&s;t profitable fi&s;hes, the north is the proper rendezvous and re&s;idence; where, under the ice, they find &s;helter from the whales that prey on them: whales being frequently obliged to ri&s;e above water, to draw breath, cannot follow their prey far under the ice. Here then they retreat, breed, and fatten; but, in order to make them &s;ub&s;ervient to the u&s;e of man, the wi&s;e Creator has ordained, that they &s;hall annually make their way &s;outhward. We &s;ee this, particularly, in herrings. Some cau&s;e, unknown to man, drives them out, in innumerable &s;hoals, like &s;warms of bees. As they advance, they are cha&s;ed by the cod, the mackarel, and
<PB N="33" REF="35">
other fi&s;h of prey; and the&s;e, in their turn, are hunted by the &s;eals and whales, and obliged to fly to the &s;hal|lowe&s;t &s;and-bank for protection, where the larger fi&s;hes cannot follow them; and, where they are caught by fi&s;hermen.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;eas not only yield herrings, &s;almon, cod-fi&s;h, &amp;c. but flounders, holibut, a variety of &s;hell-fi&s;h, and &s;ome &s;mall fi&s;hes, peculiar to this latitude.</P>
<P>Though the whole is almo&s;t univer&s;ally known, it would be unpardonable, in treating of Greenland, not to give &s;ome account of this animal, and it's fi&s;hery, which employs &s;o many &s;hips yearly of different nations, not le&s;s than 300 or 350 (each &s;hip having from five to &s;even long-boats), and that in a compa&s;s of two de|grees, from the 77th to the 79th. The&s;e &s;hips, &s;ome|times catch from 1800 to 2000 whales, in the &s;pace of two months; and wound many that e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The Greenland whale, by Engli&s;h &s;ailors called the black whale, is de&s;cribed, in <HI>Marten's Voyage to Spitz|berg,</HI> and <HI>Zordrager's Greenland Fi&s;hery,</HI> to be from 50 to 80 feet long. They were formerly from 100 to 200 feet in length; but being now caught in &s;uch multi|tudes, have not time to grow to their full &s;ize. The head is a third part of the length of the whole body; it has only two fins, one on each &s;ide of the head, from five to eight feet long, but with the&s;e it rows along very
<PB N="34" REF="36">
fa&s;t. It's tail is &s;ix or eight yards broad, and turning up at both ends in a curve, is enabled with it to da&s;h the &s;tronge&s;t boat in pieces; it is, however, a timid animal, never beginning an attack, but flying at the lea&s;t alarm. It's &s;kin, above, is commonly black and &s;mooth, like velvet, and white underneath. On the head is a bunch, where are two no&s;trils, through which it breathes, and &s;pouts out the water it takes in at it's mouth, with a noi&s;e that can be heard at three miles di&s;tance. It's eyes are placed between it's no&s;trils and fins; and have eye-lids that drop over them, and are not larger than tho&s;e of an ox. It has no flaps to it's ears, nor any teeth in it's mouth; but contains, in it's upper-jaw, which is &s;ix yards long, tho&s;e barders, blades, or whi&s;kers, as they are called, of which we make the whale-bone. There are commonly 350 on each &s;ide; but the 50 large&s;t only are taken. They hang like the pipes of an organ; the lea&s;t before and behind, the longe&s;t in the middle, which are generally four yards in length. The tongue con&s;i&s;ts wholly of &s;oft, fungous fat, like bacon, which will fill from five to &s;even large barrels. This fi&s;h brings forth it's young like a quadruped, full-formed, generally one at a time, but never more than two, which it &s;uckles; when pur&s;ued, it wraps up it's young in it's fins, clo&s;e to it's body. Whales have two &s;kins, the inner an inch thick, the outer one as thin as parchment; under the&s;e, lies the fat, from &s;ix to 12 inches thick; about the under lip, it is two feet in thickne&s;s. The fat of the whale will, according to the &s;ize of the fi&s;h, fill from 100 to 300
<PB N="35" REF="37">
barrels. It's fle&s;h is coar&s;e, and is &s;aid to ta&s;te like beef. Greenlanders eat the part about the tail, and call it a delicacy. It's bones are hard; on the in&s;ide, full of holes, like a honey-comb, and filled with train.</P>
<P>One would &s;uppo&s;e, that this enormous bea&s;t would require a great many large fi&s;hes for one meal's food; but it's &s;wallow being &s;carce four inches broad, it lives chiefly on a white &s;lime, &s;wimming on the &s;ea, called whale's food; but which, in fact, is an animal wearing that appearance. This it &s;ups up, by &s;trong &s;uction; and, as a great deal of water flows in with it, the animal blows out the water again at it's no&s;trils. This &s;lime being found, in the greate&s;t quantity, between Spitz|berg, Nova Zembla and Greenland (where it floats in &s;uch abundance, that the creeks are as full of it as our ditches with in&s;ects), the whale rarely emigrates from the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>The manner of catching whales, is as follows:&mdash;When a whale is &s;een or heard, a long-boat, with &s;ix men in it (for there are always five or &s;ix &s;uch boats ready) makes up to it, and endeavours to approach it's &s;ide, near the head. The whale, finding it&s;elf pur&s;ued, dives, but ri&s;ing again to breathe, which it is con&s;trained to do, the men watch the opportunity, row up to it's &s;ide, and the harpooner &s;trikes him u&s;ually near the fin, with a harpoon (a triangular, barbed iron, about a foot long, and fa&s;tened to a &s;tem.) The fi&s;h no &s;ooner feels the
<PB N="36" REF="38">
&s;mart, than it darts down into the deep, with the har|poon &s;ticking fa&s;t in it. To this harpoon is fa&s;tened a line 200 yards long, and about as thick as one's finger; which runs with &s;uch rapidity after the whale, that if it entangles it&s;elf, mu&s;t either &s;nap &s;hort, or over&s;et the boat: it is one man's bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore, to attend to this line, and wet the place on the boat's edge, on which it runs, le&s;t it &s;hould take fire. The boat, with the line, follows the whale as far it can; and, if the fi&s;h is not mortally wounded, it will flounce about in the deep for an hour, and draw a line of 4,000 yards after it: in which ca&s;e, fre&s;h line is added by other boats. If the fi&s;h comes up again alive, they &s;trike it with fre&s;h harpoons, and then kill it with lances. When dead, it ri&s;es to the &s;urface of the water, with it's belly upwards. Should it retreat under the ice, they either pull away the harpoon, or cut the line; in which ca&s;e, they lo&s;e the fi&s;h, a lo&s;s amounting to 200&pound;. that being it's aver|age value.</P>
<P>The whale, being dead, is towed up to the &s;hip's &s;ide, and there fa&s;tened: the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s is then to go, with a boat, into it's jaws, and cut out the whale-bone. They next cut off the blubber from the tongue; and then proceed to &s;trip the whole body of it's fat, begin|ning at the head and tail at once, and ending in the middle. Forty or fifty men &s;tand on the fi&s;h for this purpo&s;e, and will &s;trip it in four hours. With the lo&s;s of it's fat, the fi&s;h lo&s;es it's buoyant faculty; and, when
<PB N="37" REF="39">
turned a-drift, down goes the carca&s;s into the deep, with the general and joyful huzza of the whole crew; in a few days, it bur&s;ts, and ri&s;es again, and it's va&s;t &s;tock of fle&s;h, is a profu&s;e fea&s;t to fi&s;hes, birds and bears.</P>
<P>This is the European mode of whale-fi&s;hing; but that of the Greenlanders is &s;omewhat different. The women a&s;&s;i&s;t in this bu&s;ine&s;s; their employ being to row the boats, and mend the &s;eamens jackets, When they &s;ee a fi&s;h, they row boldly up to it, and &s;trike it with &s;everal harpoons, to which are hung large bladders, made of &s;eal's &s;kin, which &s;o incumber and impede the motion of the animal, that he cannot dive deep. When tired out, they di&s;patch him with their lances. The men then creep into their &s;ea, or &s;pring-jackets; which are made of &s;eals'-&s;kin with air-bladders, and cover their feet, hands and head, all in one piece, being fa&s;tened tight upon the head. In the&s;e, they leap, fear|le&s;s, upon the fi&s;h, and into the &s;ea, the air in their jackets keeping them erect in the water. They next proceed, as do the Europeans, to cut out the fat and whale-bone. And here the multitude are very di&s;or|derly; all running, promi&s;cuou&s;ly, in a heap, men, women and children, one over another, with &s;harp|pointed knives (for every one, though a &s;pectator only, may &s;hare in dividing the &s;poil), and it is wonderful how careful they are, in all this &s;cramble, not to wound one another.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="40">The &s;eal, al&s;o, is a native of the north-&s;eas, is an amphibious animal, with four feet, and called, in many places, the &s;ea-calf, or &s;ea-wolf. It has a rough, hairy hide, u&s;ed by us to cover travelling trunks. It's head pretty much re&s;embles that of a dog, with the ears cropt, having a &s;mall aperture for the ear, but no flaps: it's body, in the middle, is bulky, but runs out pointed towards each end, for the convenience of making better way through the water. It has two &s;hort feet before, &s;tanding downwards, perpendicularly; and two others behind, in a horizontal direction, with webbed toes, like tho&s;e of a goo&s;e. The water is it's natural element, as it lives upon fi&s;h; but, having long nails in it's fore feet, it climbs the rocks, and is often upon land. It's cry is like a wild &s;wine; and, the young ones, mew like a cat. It has &s;harp teeth, and large, fiery eyes, with eye-brows.</P>
<P>Seals are often found on the ice and land, ba&s;king, or &s;leeping, in the &s;un; and, though they have a lame gait, or walk, can pad along &s;o fa&s;t, and, by means of their hind-feet, &s;pring forward &s;o quick, that a man cannot ea&s;ily come up with them. They are taken for their fat and &s;kins. Their fat, which is near four inches thick, is converted into train-oil; and their fle&s;h is red, tender, and juicy, re&s;embling, in ta&s;te, the fle&s;h of a wild hog.</P>
<P>There are five or &s;ix &s;pecies of &s;eals; &s;ome two yards, and &s;ome three yards in length. I have &s;een one,
<PB N="39" REF="41">
&s;ays <HI>Crantz,</HI> called a &s;ea-cow, of the &s;eal &s;pecies, &s;ix yards in length, and near as much in circumference over the brea&s;t. This creature weighed 400 pounds; and as it's eyes, on pre&s;&s;ing the &s;kin, &s;prung out a finger's length, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, the animal could throw them out, and draw them in for &s;helter, at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Seals, in general, yield a great deal of blubber; and the train that drops from it, is not more rancid than &s;tale oil of olives; and, with their &s;kins, the Greenlanders frequently make their wai&s;tcoats. They cannot ea&s;ily be caught by a &s;ingle per&s;on, unle&s;s when they are big with young, and, of cour&s;e, helple&s;s; but, as they are animals of pa&s;&s;age, retiring from Greenland in March, to ca&s;t their young, and returning in June, young and all, like a flock of &s;heep, the &s;eal-hunters endeavour, on their return, to &s;urround them on the ice, where they often lie &s;leeping, in whole herds. They fir&s;t frighten them by &s;houting, which occa&s;ions them to &s;tretch out their necks and yell, at which time the catchers take the op|portunity to &s;tun them, by giving them a de&s;perate blow on their no&s;es; after which they kill, and flay them.</P>
<P>To the Greenlanders, the &s;eal-fi&s;hery is the be&s;t harve&s;t. Seals' fle&s;h, with that of the rein-deer, is their mo&s;t delicious, and &s;ub&s;tantial food: the fat &s;upplies their lamps and fires with oil, &s;oftens their dry food, and, by barter, furni&s;hes them with all the nece&s;&s;aries of life. Of the fibres of &s;eals' &s;inews, they make thread;
<PB N="40" REF="42">
the tran&s;parent &s;kins of their entrails &s;erve them for windows, curtains for their tents, &s;hirts, and tho&s;e blad|ders they fix to their harpoons; and of the maw, they make train bottles. When there is a &s;carcity of iron, they make in&s;truments and tools of their bones: their blood, with other ingredients, they convert into &s;oups; and make their cloaths, bedding, and boats, of their &s;kins.</P>
<P>Catching &s;eals, therefore, is the great end of Greenland education: to which the children are trained from their infancy; by which they maintain them&s;elves; become agreeable to each other, and u&s;eful members of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>They have two kinds of boats for this purpo&s;e; a large one, and a &s;mall one. The large one, they call, <HI>Umiack,</HI> or, the woman's boat; and, the &s;mall one, <HI>Kaiak.</HI> The woman's boat is from 12 to 18 yards in length, four or five feet wide, and three deep; the other, about &s;ix yards long, 18 inches broad, and barely 12 inches deep: they are &s;lat-bottomed, wide&s;t in the middle, go off &s;harp at each end, and are covered with &s;eal-&s;kin. The large boats are open at the top, and are commonly rowed by four women; one &s;teering with an oar, behind. In the fore-part, is a ma&s;t, with a &s;ail made of &s;eal-gut &s;kin, &s;ix feet high, and nine feet wide. The wealthy Green|landers, make this &s;ail of white linen, with red &s;tripes; and, though they can, with this &s;ail, make way only before the wind, and cannot keep pace with an Euro|pean
<FIGURE>

<PB N="41" REF="44">
boat under &s;ail, yet they can row them fa&s;ter, and often make voyages along the coa&s;t, from two to 400 leagues north and &s;outh, with their tents, hou&s;ehold furniture, all their property, and often 10 or 20 per&s;ons be&s;ides. The men accompany them in their <HI>kaiaks,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;t them, when they need it. They thus travel at the rate of 12 leagues a-day; and every night unload, pitch their tents, draw their boat a-&s;hore, and &s;tay till the next morning.&mdash;<HI>(See the Plate).</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Kaiak</HI> is covered on the top, having a round hole in the middle, into which the Greenlander &s;lips with his feet, &s;itting on a board, covered with a &s;oft &s;kin; when he is &s;eated, the rim of the hole reaches ju&s;t above his hips, and he tucks his great water-coat in, between the boat and him&s;elf, &s;o tight, that the water cannot penetrate; this coat being, at the &s;ame time, buttoned clo&s;e about his face and body, the man and his boat are, as it were, one ma&s;s. At his &s;ide he places his lance and harpoon; and, behind him, the &s;eal-&s;kin bladder. His <HI>pautik,</HI> or oar (for he has but one), is made of red deal, round in the middle, and three fingers broad at each end. This he holds in the middle, with both hands, and &s;trikes the water, on each &s;ide, very quick, and as regular as if beating time. Thus equipped, he goes out to fi&s;h; and, if expedition requires it, can row 20 or 24 leagues a day. In the&s;e <HI>Kaiaks,</HI> they fear no &s;torms, can mount the boi&s;terous billows like a piece of cork, and, &s;hould a wave break over them,
<PB N="42" REF="45">
are unconcerned; for they accu&s;tom them&s;elves, by way of exerci&s;e, to overturn them&s;elves in the water, &s;o as that their heads &s;hall hang perpendicularly down, and, with a &s;wing, and &s;troke with their paddle, &s;et their boat to rights again, in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>When a Greenlander &s;pies a &s;eal, he endeavours to conceal him&s;elf behind a wave, till he is within 10 or 12 yards of it, in order to take him by &s;urpri&s;e. Having his lance, harpoon and tackle ready, as &s;oon as within reach, he ca&s;ts the harpoon, and, if he hits his mark, the &s;eal, feeling him&s;elf wounded, dives; dragging the bladder, which is fa&s;tened by a &s;tring to the harpoon, under water with him; though, from it's &s;ize, he finds it difficult &s;o to do: but, as the animal mu&s;t come up every quarter of an hour to breathe, no &s;oon grows weary of diving, is followed by the Greenlander, and pierced with a lance, as he ri&s;es. When killed, the wound is &s;topped, to pre&s;erve the blood. This done, the &s;eal-catcher perforates the &s;kin, blows up the ani|mal like a bladder, to make it buoyant, and takes it in tow.</P>
<P>In this exerci&s;e, he is expo&s;ed to great danger, for, &s;hould the line which fa&s;tens the bladder to the harpoon, and which is of &s;ome length, entangle it&s;elf with the <HI>Kaiak,</HI> the boat mu&s;t be drawn down under water; nay, &s;hould he e&s;cape this danger, if he approaches too near the dying &s;eal, it will bite him mortally. A female &s;eal,
<PB N="43" REF="46">
that has young, will often fly at it's enemy with fury, or bite a hole in the boat, and &s;ink it.</P>
<P>It is the &s;tupid &s;pecies of &s;eal which the Greenlander can thus take, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Other &s;eals are caught by companies of fi&s;hermen. At certain &s;ea&s;ons, they retire into creeks and inlets. There the Greenlanders cut off their retreat, and frighten them under water, by &s;houting, clapping, and throwing &s;tones.. When they come up to draw breath, they a&s;&s;ail them again, in the &s;ame manner, till they tire them out, that they can dive no longer. They are then &s;urrounded, and killed. This mode of catching them, is called <HI>Ka&s;&s;igiak,</HI> or, clapper-hunt: it is not bad &s;port, and the Greenland|ers are very active and expert at it. If a &s;eal has good, broad water, three or four leagues each way, it can keep the hunters in play for two hours, diving, and ri&s;ing again, at the di&s;tance of three quarters of a mile. Should it, in it's fright, take to the land, it is there attacked by women and children.</P>
<P>They are often caught, al&s;o, on the ice; many being killed, whil&s;t &s;leeping and &s;noring in the &s;un: and, in the &s;pring-time, where the current makes a great hole in the ice, the Greenlanders will often &s;tation them|&s;elves round it, and, when the &s;eals come in droves to the edge of this hole to breathe, kill them with their harpoons.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the Natives.</HEAD>
<P>THE Greenlanders are of low &s;tature, not exceed|ing five feet in height; but they are well-&s;haped, and proportionate in their limbs. Their faces are ge|nerally broad and flat, with high cheek-bones, like the Scots; but their cheeks are round and plump. It is a common ob&s;ervation, &s;ays <HI>Ellis,</HI> in his de&s;cription of the E&s;quimaux Indians, that men as well as bea&s;ts, and the products of the ground, with &s;ome few exceptions, are &s;maller and &s;maller as they are more under the pole; for, though there are large trees growing at the bottom of Hud&s;on's Bay, there are nothing but &s;hrubs in the 61&s;t degree: and al&s;o, that the people keep dimini&s;hing in &s;tature, according to the higher latitude they live in, till the 67th degree, where there are no inhabitants at all.</P>
<P>The eyes of the Greenlanders are little and black, but without any animation; and their no&s;es project but little from their faces. Their bodies are all over of a dark grey; but their faces, are of an olive-colour. As their children are born white, this grey tinge may pro|ceed in part from their dirtine&s;s, for they are continually handling train-oil and grea&s;e, &s;itting in the &s;moke, and &s;eldom wa&s;h them&s;elves; their food, al&s;o, may contri|bute
<PB N="45" REF="48">
to the &s;ame end; for their blood is &s;o affected by it, that their &s;weat &s;mells like train, and their hands feel clammy, like bacon. But there are a few, who&s;e faces are not &s;o round, and who&s;e complexions are fairer, and might ea&s;ily pa&s;s, undi&s;tingui&s;hed, among the natives of Switzerland.</P>
<P>Their hair, on their heads, is, univer&s;ally, &s;trong and long, and of a coal-black colour; but the men have &s;eldom any beard, as they take great pains to pluck it out. Their hands and feet are &s;mall, and &s;oft; but their head and limbs, are large. They have high brea&s;ts and broad &s;houlders, e&s;pecially the women; who accu&s;tom them&s;elves to carry heavy burdens; and, being fat and corpulent, can endure the cold, with bare heads and necks, and very thin cloathing: nay, the men commonly &s;it naked within doors, except their breeches; and, at this time, their bodies emit &s;uch a &s;team, as to be in|tolerable to a European &s;itting near them. They are very light and active, do not want for &s;trength, and can endure great fatigues. A Greenlander, who has eat nothing but gra&s;s for three days, will manage his little canoe in the mo&s;t boi&s;terous &s;ea; and, a woman will carry a rein-deer, whole, for the di&s;tance of four leagues, or a piece of timber, or &s;tone, double the weight which any Engli&s;hman can lift.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to their temper, they are of a phleg|matic nature; not very lively, but good-humoured,
<PB N="46" REF="49">
&s;ociable, and far from covetous: they are &s;o little con|cerned for the future, as to hoard up nothing; of cour&s;e, are very liberal in giving. They are not, apparently, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any high &s;pirit, but have a good &s;hare of what we call ru&s;tic pride; and con&s;ider Europeans as far beneath them; e&s;teeming them&s;elves the only civi|lized and well-bred people. When they &s;ee a quiet and mode&s;t &s;tranger, they &s;ay&mdash; <Q>He is almo&s;t as well-bred as us.</Q>&mdash;They are not quarrel&s;ome, but patient, and draw back where any one encroaches on them: but, if pu&s;hed to extremes, become de&s;perate in the greate&s;t degree.</P>
<P>Though they are always bu&s;y about &s;omething, they are very fickle, and have no per&s;everance; &s;o that, if they begin a thing, and meet with a difficulty, they throw it away. In &s;ummer-time, they &s;leep five, or &s;ix hours; in winter, eight: and, if they have worked hard, and had a re&s;tle&s;s night, will &s;leep the whole en&s;uing day. In the morning, they will walk to &s;ome emi|nence, take a pro&s;pect of the weather and the ocean, and, if it appears unfavourable, will &s;eem thoughtful and dejected, as at the dangers and burdens of the day; but, when no difficulties ri&s;e before them, or when they return home from a &s;ucce&s;sful fi&s;hery, they are chearful and conver&s;able.</P>
<P>They are &s;o expert at concealing and expre&s;&s;ing their pa&s;&s;ions, that we might take them for Stoics; and,
<PB N="47" REF="50">
they affect to be very re&s;igned, under any calamity: but it is all affectation; for no people are more ir|ritable to anger, and more revengeful, when an oppor|tunity offers.</P>
<P>Their cloaths are made of the &s;kin of the rein-deer, &s;eals, and birds. Their outer garment re&s;embles a wag|goner's frock, only not &s;o long and loo&s;e; and they put it on the &s;ame way, drawing it over their heads, like a &s;hirt: at the top of it is a hood, which they can pull up, occa&s;ionally, over their heads, like the hood of a ca|puchin. Their under-garment is a kind of &s;hirt, made of the &s;kins of birds, with the feathers inwards. At pre&s;ent, mo&s;t Greenlanders of any property, make their upper garment of cloth, or cotton, yet cut in their own fa&s;hion. Their breeches are of &s;eals'-&s;kin, and are very &s;hort, above and below: their &s;tockings are made of the &s;kin of a &s;eal's foetus, taken out of the body of the dam; and their &s;hoes, of &s;mooth, black, dre&s;&s;ed &s;eal-leather, tied with a thong on the in&s;tep. The &s;oles of their &s;hoes &s;tand out bending upwards, both before and behind, two inches broad, but they have no heels. The rich natives, now, wear woollen &s;tockings, breeches and caps; and, when they make a voyage, cover them&s;elves with a black, &s;mooth, &s;eal's-hide, by way of great coat.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the women is much the &s;ame; only that their jackets have higher &s;houlders, and a higher hood;
<PB N="48" REF="51">
and are not cut round, even at the bottom, like the mens', but, from the thigh, drop in a point before and behind, below the knee, and are bordered with red cloth. The women, al&s;o, wear breeches, with &s;hort drawers under them. They wear a kind of high &s;hoes, or boots, of white, or red leather, the &s;eam of which is before, and ornamented. Mothers and nur&s;es wear an upper-garment, wide in the back, with a pocket in the &s;houlders, large enough to hold a child, which is left there quite naked to tumble about, and is no other|wi&s;e taken care of. They are very neat, and careful of their be&s;t cloaths; but, their every-day dre&s;s drips with grea&s;e, and their heads &s;warm with vermin, na|tural to their filth, which, like beggars, they are expert at catching, and kill between their teeth.</P>
<P>The men wear their hair cut &s;hort in the poll, and &s;quared off on their foreheads; but, as it is a reproach to a woman to cut her hair (except in ca&s;es of deep mourning, or when they re&s;olve never to marry), they tie it up to the top of their heads, &s;o as to ornament their crowns, binding it with gla&s;s beads, or &s;ome gay bandage. The &s;ame kind of ornaments they wear round their arms and necks, and in their ears, and round the borders of their cloaths, and &s;hoes: but, &s;uch as aim at being beautiful, and want to be admired, draw threads, blacked with foot, under the &s;kin of their chins, cheeks, hands and feet; which leave a black mark behind, as in the face re&s;embles a beard.

mother performs this painful operation on her girls in their infancy, le&s;t they &s;hould never get a hu&s;band. The Indians, in North-America, and &s;everal tribes of the Tartars, do the &s;ame; but, the Greenlanders, now converted to chri&s;tianity, have dropped this practice, as a fooli&s;h vanity, and a temptation to &s;in.</P>
<P>In winter they live in hou&s;es, and tents in &s;ummer. Their hou&s;es or cottages, are generally built on &s;ome eminence near the &s;ea, in order that the &s;now may run from them. They are &s;eldom more than about four yards broad, and from 8 to 24 yards in length, according to the &s;ize of the family, and ju&s;t high enough for a per|&s;on to &s;tand upright in. They are built with &s;tones and &s;ods. Their hou&s;es have neither door nor chimney, but the deficiency is &s;upplied by a pa&s;&s;age 5 or 6 yards long, by which they can pa&s;s through the middle of the hou&s;e, the roof of which pa&s;&s;age is &s;o low, that they are obliged to creep in almo&s;t on their hands and feet. This long entrance keeps out the wind and cold, and lets out the thick air, for as they burn only oil within, they have no &s;moke. The in&s;ide of the walls are hung with old tent and boat-&s;kins, and the roofs covered with the &s;ame. From the middle of the hou&s;e to the back-wall, there is a rai&s;ed floor or broad bench, like a taylor's &s;hop-board, made with wood and covered with &s;kins, and this floor is divided by &s;kins, &s;treched from the po&s;ts that &s;up|port the roof, into apartments, like hor&s;e-&s;talls, in each of which a family lives, &s;o that hou&s;es contain from
<PB N="50" REF="54">
three to ten families, &s;ome more, and &s;ome le&s;s. On the&s;e floors, they &s;it in the day-time; the men with their legs hanging down, the women behind, cro&s;s-legged, like a taylor; and, in the night, they &s;leep on them. Along the front-wall, oppo&s;ite to this wall, are &s;everal &s;quare windows, made of &s;eals' guts and halibuts' maws, and &s;ewed &s;o neat and tight as to keep out the weather, and yet admit the light. A bench runs along the whole length of the hou&s;e under the windows, where &s;trangers &s;it, or &s;leep.</P>
<P>By every po&s;t is a fire-place. A block of wood is laid upon the ground, and upon that a flat &s;tone; on the &s;tone, a low, three-legged &s;tool, and on that &s;tool a lamp, a foot long, re&s;embling a half moon, hewn out marble; it &s;tands in an oval, wooden bowl, placed un|der the lamp, to receive the wa&s;te oil. In this lamp, filled with &s;eal-oil, they lay &s;ome mo&s;s, rubbed fine, which burns &s;o bright, and gives &s;uch a heat, as not only lights the apartment, but warms it. Over this lamp hangs a marble kettle, by four &s;trings, fa&s;tened to the roof, in which they boil their meat; and over this, is placed a wooden rack, on which they lay their wet cloaths, and boots, to dry.</P>

<P>Now, as there are many &s;uch fire-places in one hou&s;e, and as they burn night and day, there is an equal and la&s;ting heat; but, though the&s;e lamps yield no &s;moke, their rancid &s;mell, and the &s;team ari&s;ing from boiling &s;o much fle&s;h and fi&s;h, often half-rotten, and add to this, their urinals within the hou&s;e, with &s;kins &s;oaking in them for dre&s;&s;ing, is almo&s;t intolerable to a per&s;on unaccu&s;tomed to it. But, in other re&s;pects, we cannot but admire their well-contrived hou&s;e-keeping, com|prized within &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s; their content in this
<PB N="52" REF="56">
&s;tate of poverty, in which they conceive them&s;elves richer than us; and, their order and quiet, in &s;uch a narrow and crowded &s;pot.</P>
<P>Without the&s;e man&s;ions, they have little &s;tore-hou&s;es, where they lay up their provi&s;ion; and, clo&s;e by, are their boats, drawn on the land, and laid upon po&s;ts, with their bottoms upwards, to pre&s;erve them.</P>
<P>In dre&s;&s;ing their meat, they are as dirty as in every thing el&s;e; &s;eldom wa&s;hing their kettles, but leaving them to the dogs to clean. Their boiled meat, and broth, they eat with bone-&s;poons, from a wooden di&s;h; but, their undre&s;&s;ed meat, lies on the bare ground. They eat with their fingers, and tear with their teeth; and, when the repa&s;t is over, &s;crape their chops with a knife, lick the blades, and put it in their pockets. So, when they are covered with &s;weat, they make their knife perform the &s;ame office, and &s;crape it from their faces down into their mouths. When they wi&s;h to treat a European genteelly, they fir&s;t lick the meat, he is to eat, clean from the blood and &s;cum it had contracted in the kettle, with their tongue; and, &s;hould this not be well received, it would be looked upon as rude and unmannerly.</P>
<P>They eat when they are hungry; but the evening-meal is the chief repa&s;t; when they frequently invite
<PB N="53" REF="57">
their neighbours, or &s;end them a part of it. The men eat fir&s;t, by them&s;elves; and their greate&s;t joy is, to &s;ee their children &s;tuff them&s;elves &s;o full, as to roll about the ground, to make room for more. They take no thought for the morrow; but, when they have plenty, will dance and eat to exce&s;s, in hopes that the &s;ea will afford them a fre&s;h &s;upply the next day. But, the misfortune is, when March comes, and the &s;eals retire till May, if bad weather en&s;ues, they mu&s;t and do &s;trug|gle with hunger for many days together: nay, &s;o little do they provide for a future contingency, that they are often reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of eating mu&s;cles, &s;ea|weed, old tent-&s;kins, and &s;hoe-&s;oles, if they have but oil enough to boil them; and, after all, many a one peri&s;hes with hunger.</P>
<P>Should their fire go out, they re-kindle it, by turn|ing a &s;tick with a &s;tring, very quick, through a hole in a piece of wood; as do the E&s;kimaux Indians.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the Conduct of the Greenlanders in Dome&s;tic Life.</HEAD>
<P>AS we neither &s;ee nor hear of any unbecoming conduct in the Greenlanders, they appear to lead a good, orderly life. Single women have very &s;el|dom any ba&s;tard children. We meet with &s;uch things,
<PB N="54" REF="58">
now and then, in widows and divorced wives; but, though they are held in contempt for &s;uch things, yet &s;uch women &s;ometimes make their fortune, by &s;elling their children to tho&s;e who have none, or, by living as wives, with men who are not married. Single women are very re&s;erved, &s;eldom are &s;een in private conver|&s;ation with the men, and, a young woman would think her&s;elf affronted, if a young fellow in company was to offer her a pinch of &s;nuff.</P>
<P>A young fellow never thinks of marrying till he is turned of 20; but, when he is determined in his mind, he chu&s;es one about his own age, and acquaints his friends with the choice he has made. Marriage-por|tions are out of the que&s;tion. A man &s;eldom gets any thing with his wife, but her cloaths, her knife, her lamp, or a &s;tone-boiler. His great object, is her &s;kill in hou&s;ewifry; and, &s;he con&s;idess little el&s;e in him, than whether he is a good &s;eal-fi&s;her.</P>
<P>As a &s;on has his will in every thing, his parents im|mediately con&s;ent; and two old women are di&s;patched to the parents of the bride, as negociators. The dam|&s;el, on being acquainted with it, affects an unwilling|ne&s;s, will hear nothing of the matter, runs away and teras her hair. Sometimes, indeed, this di&s;&s;atisfaction at the news is real. Women have often fainted at the propo&s;al, and have eloped and cut off their hair, which la&s;t is an act of great con&s;equence; for, when a woman
<PB N="55" REF="59">
has once lo&s;t her hair, &s;he is never &s;ought in marriage afterwards. This aver&s;ion to matrimony is &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from the many repudiated wives in Greenland. However, if the bride's parents do not di&s;approve, the women &s;earch for the daughter, and, having &s;ound her, drag her to the hou&s;e of her &s;uitor, where &s;he &s;its, many days, dejected, with di&s;hevelled hair, and without eating any thing; and, if no per&s;wa&s;ions avail, &s;he is compelled to change her &s;tate by force. If &s;he runs away, &s;he is brought back, and immed&s;ately obliged to perform the contract.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;ome parents take care to &s;ettle their children; and, for this purpo&s;e, betroth them in their childhood: and, in this ca&s;e, they come together when they plea&s;e, without any further ceremony. Sometimes a married Greenlander, if he &s;ees a young woman he likes, at a dance, and finds her any where alone, will bring her home as a &s;econd wife, by force, and the matter is &s;oon after reconciled.</P>
<P>They &s;eldom marry a near relation; or indeed, any per&s;on bred up, with them, under the &s;ame roof; but there are &s;ome in&s;tances (though they are held odious in the eyes of the people), of a man's marrying two &s;i&s;ters, or, a mother and her daughter.</P>
<P>Being a great reproach to have no &s;on, it leads men here, occa&s;ionally, into polygamy; though it is not
<PB N="56" REF="60">
very general. Scarce a married man in twenty has more than one wife. If a woman does not breed, &s;he is &s;ometimes put away; and this, with little more cere|mony than a &s;our look on the part of the man, and packing up her cloaths, on that of the wife. When this happens, the woman returns to her own friends; and, in order to bring an odium upon him, conducts her&s;elf with great prudence and decorum.</P>
<P>Where a wife cannot agree with other women in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and this often occurs, as the hu&s;band's mother (if he has any) generally lives with him, and maintains the &s;uperiority over the family; &s;he will elope of her own accord, e&s;pecially if &s;he has no &s;on; for &s;ons are the pride of a Greenlander's heart, his greate&s;t trea&s;ure, and be&s;t &s;ecurity of his property. There have been in&s;tances, after divorce, of the hu&s;band's running into the de&s;arts, and living like a hermit, many years in a cavern, flying always at the &s;ight of his fellow-creatures. Such quarrels, however, happen only between per&s;ons in their younger years, who have married ra&s;hly. The older they grow, and the longer they live together, the &s;tronger is the at|tachment.</P>
<P>Where a man has but one wife, and &s;he dies, in a few days after, he puts on his be&s;t cloaths, and dre&s;&s;es his hou&s;e and children in the be&s;t manner. His boat and lances (his greate&s;t parade), mu&s;t al&s;o be in the com|plete&s;t
<PB N="57" REF="61">
order, and all to render him&s;elf amiable. He ab&s;tains, however, from all mirthful &s;cenes; and does not marry again till a year has clap&s;ed, unle&s;s he has young children, and no one to nur&s;e them. If he has more than one wife, and his fir&s;t wife dies, the &s;econd takes her place; but, this &s;econd mu&s;t join in the general lamentation, though the voice and tears, &s;hed on this occa&s;ion, betray, that the heart has but little &s;hare in the di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The women are not very prolific. Seldom has a wife more than three or four children; and, at mo&s;t, but &s;ix. When, therefore, they are told of the fruit|fulne&s;s of other nations, they compare them to their dogs. Very few die in child-birth; and a &s;till born, or deformed child, is &s;carce ever heard of, though the mother works ju&s;t before, and immediately after, her delivery. The child is named by the parents, or the midwife, after &s;ome bea&s;t, animal, or in&s;trument; or, after &s;ome decea&s;ed relation, if he or &s;he did not come to an accidental, or untimely death, being unwilling to renew the pain of &s;uch a lo&s;s: nay, where a per&s;on's name is the &s;ame with that of a di&s;tingui&s;hed friend lately decea&s;ed, they call him by &s;ome other name; &s;o that, in time, a Greenlander may change his name &s;everal times; and many a one is at a lo&s;s to make a &s;tranger acquainted with it, becau&s;e he is too mode&s;t to give his new, acquired name, and, perhaps, a&s;hamed of his former one.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="62">Mothers love their children exce&s;&s;ively, and carry them with them, wherever they go, in the pocket of their outer-garment, which is made, for that purpo&s;e, on their back, between their &s;houlders. They &s;uckle them till they are four or five years old, for want of proper food for children; of cour&s;e, when children are ob|liged to re&s;ign the brea&s;t to others, they will often die; and, &s;hould the mother die before the child can &s;ub&s;i&s;t on gro&s;s food, the poor infant will not long &s;urvive her.</P>
<P>Children are here brought up without any di&s;cipline, or any cha&s;ti&s;ement. They &s;eem not, indeed, to need &s;everity; as they run about quiet as lambs, and are guilty of few extravagances; be&s;ides, &s;uch is the na|ture of a Greenlander, that if he cannot be brought to do a thing by gentle u&s;age, no compul&s;ion will effect it; he would &s;ooner die than be compelled. The older children grow, and the more their under&s;tanding opens, the more governable they are: parents treat them on the footing of friends; and, if they are de&s;ired to do any thing they di&s;like, they immediately, without any apo|logy, refu&s;e; and parents put up with this refu&s;al, till the child &s;ees it's error. But in&s;tances of ingratitude, in grown up children, to their aged parents, is &s;carce ever to be met with.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as a boy can u&s;e his hands and feet, his father puts a bow and arrow into his hand, and teaches him to &s;hoot at a target. When he is 10 years old, he
<PB N="59" REF="63">
is equipped with a boat, and learns, in company with other boys, to row it, over&s;et, and ri&s;e with it, and al&s;o, to fowl and to fi&s;h. Five or &s;ix years afterwards, he goes out a &s;eal-fi&s;hing; and, the fir&s;t &s;eal he takes, is dre&s;&s;ed as a fea&s;t to the family and neighbours, where he relates his prowe&s;s with a degree of triumph, and the method he made u&s;e of to catch it. The gue&s;ts, in their turn, commend him, extol the flavour of the meat, and, from this time, the women think of finding him a wife. But he who cannot catch a &s;eal, is de&s;pi&s;ed, and ob|liged not only to live on womens' diet, &s;uch as mu&s;|cles, periwinkles, dried herrings, &amp;c. but to perform the &s;ervile offices of a woman about the hou&s;e. At 20, he makes his own boat; and, a few years after, he marries; but dwells with his parents whil&s;t they live, his mother retaining the management of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Girls are but little employed till they are 14 years of age; when they begin to &s;ew, cook, and dre&s;s lea|ther; and, as they advance in &s;trength, row the womens' boat, and build hou&s;es. As it is the man's bu&s;ine&s;s to hunt, fi&s;h, and procure provi&s;ions, &s;o is it the woman's to butcher and to dre&s;s it, for which they u&s;e no other knife, than &s;uch as chee&s;emongers u&s;e to cut their chee&s;es. It is the province of the women al&s;o, to cur|ry and prepare the leather, and perform the office of &s;hoemakers and taylors, carpenters and ma&s;ons. From their hard labour, and &s;till harder fare, women &s;eldom reach the age of 50; of cour&s;e, there are always more men than women.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="64">Their hou&s;e-keeping and manner of living, &s;eems more di&s;orderly and dirty, than that of a beggar, under a hedge. To &s;ee their dirty hands and face be&s;meared with grea&s;e, their meat dre&s;&s;ed and eaten in &s;o na&s;ty a manner, and their cloaths and &s;leeping-places &s;warming with vermin, would di&s;gu&s;t any one; but, &s;o dreadful is the climate at times, that, in tempe&s;tuous weather, a European is glad to creep into their hou&s;es and tents, for &s;helter; and, if he has nothing of his own, to &s;hare their commons, and give God thanks for the ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Dirty, however, as they are in their per&s;ons, their pacific di&s;po&s;ition is much to be admired. Several fa|milies here live in one hou&s;e; with le&s;s di&s;turbance often, than two families in one hou&s;e with us, where tho&s;e families are nearly related. If any one conceives him&s;elf injured, he only removes to another hou&s;e, and that without a murmur. They are happy to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, and live, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, in common, yet with|out one's relying on the labour of another. If a man returns home with provi&s;ion in the evening, he divides it with the families under the &s;ame roof with him: but, poor as they may be, no one pre&s;umes to a&s;k for any thing; nor, indeed, is it nece&s;&s;ary, in a country where &s;uch ho&s;pitality is practi&s;ed.</P>

<PB N="61" REF="65">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of their Civil Character.</HEAD>
<P>OF their civil character, in common life, we may &s;ay, they are di&s;creet, cautious, friendly, man|nerly and mode&s;t; but they know nothing of a fal&s;e &s;hame, a jealous re&s;erve, or a laboured affectation: they &s;tudy only to conceal their wi&s;hes and inclinations. They are not &s;o much ambitious of cutting a figure in life, as of avoiding public odium, and rendering them|them&s;elves ridiculous. They are &s;trangers to &s;alutations and tokens of re&s;pect, laugh at European compliments, and at a man's &s;tanding uncovered, in pre&s;ence of his &s;uperior; and yet, the young have a due re&s;pect for the aged, and each man a proper one for the other. In company, they are &s;ocial and jocular, and very iron|ical. Irony will often affect, what &s;everity and rea&s;on|ing cannot; but, if they are too much expo&s;ed and ri|diculed, they are as muli&s;h as a re&s;tive hor&s;e. A&s;&s;iduous to plea&s;e, and cautious not to di&s;plea&s;e, they &s;tudy to avoid every thing that will create unea&s;ine&s;s. Should one offend another, the party offended neither expo&s;tu|lates, nor returns any bad words. They have not a word, in their language, that expre&s;&s;es abu&s;e, or cur&s;|ing; of cour&s;e, they are not very quarrel&s;ome, or con|tentious. They do not contradict or interrupt any one in his di&s;cour&s;e, but one is &s;uffered to fini&s;h his &s;peech,
<PB N="62" REF="66">
before another begins. When they are diverted they will laugh, but never loud or boi&s;terou&s;ly. They are not a&s;hamed of what is natural; and, &s;o little idea have they of the indecency of breaking wind, or catching a lou&s;e, and cracking it between their teeth, that they will not take a reproof for it; but yet, in company with foreigners, where they find it di&s;agreeable, they will always forbear it.</P>
<P>When they make a vi&s;it in their boats, they never fail to take &s;ome eatable with them, as a pre&s;ent; if their company is liked, they are welcomed on the &s;hore with &s;inging, and all hands are ready to draw the boat upon land, and unload. Every one is anxious to have the gue&s;t, or gue&s;ts, at his hou&s;e; but, as the vi&s;itor is unwilling to have it thought, that he is come abroad for what he can get, he waits, with &s;ilence, till he is much pre&s;&s;ed to partake of their ho&s;pitality. As &s;oon as he enters, tiny kindly compel him to take off his upper|garment, and lend him a dry one. The men &s;it among the men, and the women by them&s;elves. The conver&s;ation of the men, runs upon the weather, hunt|ing and fi&s;hing; and, that of the women, on the death of their relations, which they clo&s;e with a general howl, and then proceed to divert their gue&s;ts with little, en|tertaining &s;tories. All the time, the horn goes round with &s;nuff, which they draw up, out of a &s;tag's horn, with their no&s;es. Meantime, the repa&s;t is prepared.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="67">A Dani&s;h factor, having been invited to a re&s;pect|able Greenlander's, told me, his dinner con&s;i&s;ted of the following di&s;hes: Dried &s;eal; boiled <HI>ditto;</HI> half raw and rotten <HI>ditto;</HI> dried herrings; boiled willocks; a piece of half-rotten whale's tail (which is reckoned as great a delicate, as a haunch of veni&s;on); dried &s;almon; dried rein-deer veni&s;on; a de&s;ert of crowberries, mixed with chyle from the maw of a rein-deer, and a di&s;h of the &s;ame, enriched with train-oil.</P>
<P>They can prolong their table-talk for &s;everal hours; which chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of the proce&s;s of the men in &s;eal|catching, to which the boys hearken with the eagere&s;t attention. If Europeans are pre&s;ent, they like to hear accounts of their country; and expre&s;s a de&s;ire to live in &s;uch a land: but, they no &s;ooner are told that it &s;ometime thunders, and there are no &s;eals to be caught, than their inclination &s;ub&s;ides, and they are happy where they are. They li&s;ten, with plea&s;ure, to God and divine things, provided no application is made to them&s;elves, and the validity of their &s;uper&s;titious fables and cu&s;toms is allowed.</P>
<P>Their traffic is very &s;imple. Money they have none; of cour&s;e, they barter with each other for what they want; and, as they are as eager for new things as children, they are for ever chopping and changing, and often to their di&s;advantage. They will give the mo&s;t u&s;eful article, in exchange, for a trifle that plea&s;es their
<PB N="64" REF="68">
fancy; and will reject a u&s;eful thing, in exchange for a bauble, if it does not plea&s;e them. They &s;eldom cheat, or &s;teal from one another, holding it infamous &s;o to do; but, they glory in over-reaching or robbing a European; e&s;teeming it a proof of &s;uperior cle|verne&s;s.</P>
<P>They keep a kind of annual fair among them&s;elves; wherever there is a meeting of the people, as at a dancing-match, or a &s;un fea&s;t; (which I &s;hall explain hereafter), they always expo&s;e their wares to view, and &s;ay what they want to exchange. And, as the people in the &s;outh have no whales, and tho&s;e in the north no wood, the Greenlanders coa&s;t the country every &s;um|mer, from 200 to 400 leagues, with new boats and tackling, exchanging them for wood, horns of the uni|corn&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;h, teeth, whale-bone, &amp;c. part of which they truck on their way back.</P>
<P>In the&s;e voyages, they take their whole family and property with them; and perhaps, &s;tay &s;ome years be|fore they return; for, wherever the winter overtakes them, there they tarry, erect a hou&s;e, and provide them|&s;elves food for the winter months. The land and &s;ea is every where their own; and, they have thus friends and acquaintance in every place.</P>
<P>Their trade with the factories, is in fox and &s;eal-&s;kins, and blubber; and the articles they take in exchange, are
<PB N="65" REF="69">
iron-points for their darts, knives, lock-&s;aws, gimblets, chi&s;&s;els and needles; &s;triped linen, cotton, ker&s;eys, woollen &s;tockings and caps, handkerchiefs, boxes, wood|en di&s;hes, pewter plates, copper kettles, looking-gla&s;&s;es, combs, ribbands, and toys for children. They are very fond of &s;nuff, powder and &s;hot. A little tobacco, which they u&s;e only as &s;nuff, they expect for every &s;mall &s;ervice they do. For a &s;mall quantity of tobacco, they will give you a couple of handfuls of unclean&s;ed eider down, a parcel of eggs, or a di&s;h of fi&s;h; and, many a &s;pendthrift, will part with the cloaths from his back, and bring penury on his family, rather than deny the cravings of his no&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;un-fea&s;t, I mentioned, is not a religious cere|mony; but, a rejoicing, at the return of the &s;un, in the winter &s;ol&s;tice, about the 22d of December. On this occa&s;ion, they a&s;&s;emble, all over the country, in large parties, and treat one another with the greate&s;t ho&s;|pitality. When they have fea&s;ted, till they are ready to bur&s;t, they ri&s;e up to play, and to dance; but, having nothing but water to drink, they cannot intoxicate them&s;elves. The only mu&s;ical in&s;trument they have, is a drum, like a tambour, which the drummer beats with a &s;tick to common time, &s;kipping at every &s;troke he gives, and making all manner of antic motions with his head and his body. This mu&s;ic he accompa|nies with a &s;ong, in honour of &s;eal-catching, and ex|pre&s;&s;es
<PB N="66" REF="70">
his joy at the return of the &s;un, it is choru&s;&s;ed by the auditory, as follows:
<Q><L>The welcome Sun returns again.</L>
<L><HI>Cho.</HI> Amna ajah, ajah, ah-hu!</L>
<L>And brings us weather fine and fair.</L>
<L><HI>Cho.</HI> Amna ajah, ajah, ah-hu!</L></Q></P>
<P>When one is tired, another begins; and thus they continue, the whole night through; the next day they &s;leep, and, in the evening, &s;tuff, dance, and &s;ing again. This fe&s;tival la&s;ts &s;everal days and nights, till they are quite exhau&s;ted, and have nothing to eat.</P>
<P>They have &s;till other amu&s;ements. When the moon &s;hines, they play at ball; and they have various me|thods of trying each others &s;trength; &s;uch, as &s;triking one another on the bare back with the fi&s;t, and trying who can hold out the longe&s;t; &s;itting down, and linking legs and arms together, endeavouring to out-pull each other, hooking their fingers together, and trying their &s;trength, by drawing, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Dancing a&s;&s;emblies are appointed, al&s;o, at other &s;ea&s;ons of the year, when they abound with &s;tores, and, if the weather is unfavourable to procure more at the&s;e times, they traffic and truck.</P>
<P><PB REF="71"><FIGURE>
<HEAD>SINGING COMBAT.</HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="72">But, the mo&s;t &s;ingular thing in Greenland, is their &s;inging and dancing combats, by which they decide their quarrels. If a man conceives him&s;elf injured, he does not vent his anger in quarrel&s;ome words, nor pro|ceed to any revenge, but compo&s;es a &s;atirical poem; this he rehear&s;es &s;o often, with &s;inging and dancing, before his family, that they all get it by heart. The man publi&s;hes his de&s;ign of fighting with his antagoni&s;t; not with a &s;word, but a &s;ong, and a place of meeting is appointed. The party challenged, attends at the place, encircled with his friends, when the challenger begins his &s;ong, to the beat of a drum, and cho|ru&s;&s;ed by his party, with <HI>Amna ajah.</HI> In this &s;ong, he di&s;charges &s;o many mortifying truths at his adver&s;ary, that the &s;tanders-by have their fill of laughing. When he has done, the accu&s;er renews his attack, and &s;o on; and, he that has the la&s;t word, gains his cau&s;e. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, they will &s;peak cutting truths; but, without rudene&s;s, or pa&s;&s;ion. The body of the people pre&s;ent con&s;titute the jury, be&s;tow the laurel, and the two contending parties become good friends.</P>
<P>It would be happy for other nations, if quarrels were terminated in the &s;ame way. No one can blame this mirthful mode of putting malevolence to the blu&s;h, and of puni&s;hing offenders by public defamation, among a &s;avage people, without religion, and, without any political con&s;titution. They live, as our ance&s;tors did, immediately after the flood, before they learned to
<PB N="68" REF="73">
covet another man's property, or rob their fellow-creature of his honour, his &s;ub&s;tance, his liberty, or his life. A father governs his own family in the be&s;t manner he can; but never pre&s;umes to command, out of that circle.</P>
<P>Should there be a fire under the &s;ame roof, more ac|quainted with the weather, or a better &s;eal-catcher than ordinary, he is looked up to, and attended to, in other matters; is allowed the be&s;t end of the hou&s;e to live in, generally the north end; and, if any refu&s;e to obey his dictates, they will not live in the &s;ame hou&s;e with him another winter.</P>
<P>Families are &s;o attached to each other, that they keep together as long as they live, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t one another, if occa&s;ion requires. Where a number of boats go together in company, they generally follow the wi&s;e&s;t man, or the be&s;t pilot. No one pre&s;umes to u&s;urp the lea&s;t authority over another; nor call him to account for his private actions. And, as they have no overplus, or riches, they are never called on to con|tribute to the public weal.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Delager,</HI> in his relation of the ways and cu&s;toms of the Greenlanders, &s;ays, the whole country &s;tands open before them. Every man may go and live where he will; but, if he finds inhabitants already &s;ettled on the intended &s;pot, he will not land, till an intimation is
<PB N="69" REF="74">
given him, that he is welcome there. Hunting and fi&s;hing, which is all the land affords, has no game-act to re&s;train it, but is every where free to all; nor does any one think of a pro&s;ecution. If a perfect &s;tranger comes to reap in the harve&s;t that God hath given, at a good fi&s;hery, nay, even at a &s;almon-wier, which others have erected with great trouble; they are only required not to harm, nor frighten the fi&s;h away. Should &s;trangers act again&s;t this order, the inhabitants will rather go away them&s;elves, and put up with the lo&s;s, than quarrel with them. Whoever finds drift-wood, or the &s;poils of a &s;hipwreck, on the &s;trand, enjoys it as his own, though he does not live there. But he mu&s;t hawl it a&s;hore, and lay a &s;tone upon it, as a token, that &s;ome one has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and this &s;tone is their deed of &s;ecurity, for no other Greenlander will offer to meddle with it afterwards. If a &s;eal e&s;capes from a man, with his javelin in it, and another man afterwards kills it, it belongs to the fir&s;t man that &s;truck it; but, if the creature is &s;truck with the harpoon and bladder, and the &s;tring breaks, he that threw fir&s;t, lo&s;es his right. If two &s;trike a &s;eal at the &s;ame time, they divide it between them. Fowling rules are the &s;ame. If any one finds a dead &s;eal, with a harpoon in it, he keeps the &s;eal, but re&s;tores the harpoon to him that lo&s;t it. If they catch a &s;ea-cow, or any other &s;uch animal of the ocean, he that ca&s;t the weapon, claims the head and tail for his own; but, of the carca&s;e, every man may cut off as much as he can. In &s;hort, they have a variety of
<PB N="70" REF="75">
u&s;ages with re&s;pect to property among them; and, how|ever ab&s;urd &s;ome of them may be, yet, they never like alterations; and their final rea&s;on is,&mdash;<Q>The cu&s;tom is <HI>now</HI> &s;o.</Q></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of their Moral Character.</HEAD>
<P>WE wi&s;h we were able to &s;peak deci&s;ively, upon their <HI>moral</HI> character, as we have done upon their <HI>civil</HI> one. Con&s;idering, that the Greenlanders act not by the light of nature, or revelation, it is &s;urpri&s;ing to find &s;o many lovely and laudable qualities in them; qualities, that mu&s;t often put chri&s;tians to the blu&s;h: but, as they ground their good di&s;po&s;itions, on a bad principle, namely, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, it will naturally be &s;up|po&s;ed, they mu&s;t frequently act in oppo&s;ition to <HI>our</HI> notions of right and wrong. Though the natives of Greenland are a &s;avage people, untaught and uncivi|lized, they are &s;trangers to many vices, which other nations are addicted to. We hear no cur&s;ing among them, &s;wearing, &s;colding, or noi&s;y contentions; no bawling, loud laughter, contradicting, detracting, or railing; and, though they delight in returning an un|becoming action, with irony, and humourous contempt, yet they make u&s;e of no coar&s;e, much le&s;s immode&s;t joke, no bitter mockery, no filthine&s;s, nor foolery.
<PB N="71" REF="76">
Lying, cheating, and &s;tealing, are &s;eldom heard of; and violent a&s;&s;aults, or highway robberies, never. Drunk|enne&s;s is unknown in Greenland; as to ob&s;cenity, not the lea&s;t trace of it can ever be di&s;covered, either in their conver&s;ation, or their conduct; and, in all their fe&s;tive meetings, to which old and young re&s;ort, nothing is &s;een or heard, that can put even mode&s;ty to the blu&s;h. Though their children are bred up without education, they are naturally tractable and governable, and give their parents very little vexation; and, when they arrive at the years of maturity, they are &s;o far from being di&s;obedient, ungrateful, or neglectful of their aged parents, that a &s;on and his wife, will often com|pliment an old, peevi&s;h mother, with the di&s;po&s;al of their whole property.</P>
<P>Now, as the Greenlanders are not influenced by laws, either human or divine; to what are we to attri|bute the&s;e &s;pecious virtues? One would &s;uppo&s;e, to rea&s;on, or common &s;en&s;e; as we cannot ob&s;erve, in them, however, any reflection, or con&s;ideration; but, that a general heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s is their characteri&s;tic; I am inclined to think, &s;ays <HI>Crantz,</HI> that their moral actions mu&s;t proceed more from in&s;tinct, than from principles; and, that this in&s;tinct &s;hews it&s;elf in a quick &s;en&s;ibility, in ca&s;es of &s;elf-love, profit, fear, and &s;hame.</P>
<P>That they are as naturally prone to evil, as the re&s;t of mankind, is beyond a doubt; but the fear of re|taliation
<PB N="72" REF="77">
of evil, re&s;trains them from many vices; and, the dread of a bad, or nick-name, from more. Their &s;ocial and amicable di&s;po&s;ition, and their univer&s;al ho&s;pitality, does not proceed from an innate bene|volence, or commi&s;eration for the helple&s;s, but from &s;elf-love, and intere&s;t. They give, in hopes of re|ceiving again, &s;hould they &s;tand in need of it; and, they are ho&s;pitable, that they may be treated ho&s;pitably in return. They are pretty well ver&s;ed in that fa&s;hionable morality, called <HI>&s;aving appearances.</HI> You will &s;eldom find a Greenlander do a good office, without the mercenary view of &s;ome &s;peedy retribution. Should a &s;tranger die, and leave a helple&s;s family, without a near relation to befriend them, no one will take charge of that family, except one who wants a maid &s;ervant; but they will, unfeelingly, &s;uffer the poor wretches to die with cold and hunger. If per&s;ons, on &s;hore, &s;ee a boat over&s;et, at &s;ea; if he is not a relation, or one that has &s;erved them, they will look on, with indifference, and &s;ee him peri&s;h. But, among relations, there are traces of much &s;tronger love, than is to be met with m more civilized countries. Many a mother has thrown her&s;elf into the &s;ea, becau&s;e her child was drowned; &s;o is it with irrational animals; though they are in&s;en|&s;ible to the pain and plea&s;ure of their fellow-creatures, their love and concern for their own young, is &s;o much the &s;tronger;&mdash;another rea&s;on to believe, that the Green|landers are actuated by in&s;tinct, rather than by human rea&s;on. They &s;eem, likewi&s;e, to have no gratitude; for,
<PB N="73" REF="78">
if a European does them a piece of &s;ervice, their mere thanks are all they are di&s;po&s;ed to return; &s;hould their benefactor at any time be in want of their &s;ervices, he would not often find it. When they are dre&s;&s;ed in their be&s;t cloaths, they will &s;trut about in their finery, and look down on all around them with contempt, e&s;|pecially if they can boa&s;t of any extraordinary dexterity, or have been fortunate in &s;eal-catching. If their pa&s;|&s;ions, (which they have art enough occa&s;ionally to con|ceal) once break out, they rage with more than brutal fury. What they have a mind to do, mu&s;t be done, and nothing can per&s;uade them again&s;t their inclinations.</P>
<P>Though, as we have ob&s;erved, they are remarkably cha&s;te in public, they are as much the rever&s;e in pri|vate, as other nations. Their polygamy does not ari&s;e from a de&s;ire of population, but chiefly from lu&s;t. Though a &s;ingle woman &s;eldom pro&s;titutes her per&s;on; married women will, where they can, and without a blu&s;h.</P>
<P>Their treatment of poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed widows, is not only unju&s;t, but barbarous. If the widow has no near relations, &s;he is &s;uffered to lie on the ground with her helple&s;s children, bewailing the death of her hu&s;|band almo&s;t to di&s;traction; and her vi&s;itors, whil&s;t they bear the compliments of condolence on their tongues, will clande&s;tinely &s;trip her of her little property; and, the unhappy, de&s;poiled wretch, having no court of ju|dicature
<PB N="74" REF="79">
to lodge her complaint in, is left to the di&s;agreeable alternative of lying down to &s;tarve, or ingratiating her&s;elf, perhaps, with him who has been her greate&s;t plunderer. He will, in all likelihood, keep her for a time, and, if &s;he cannot get into the favour of another, &s;he is left with her children to protract life a little longer, by eating fi&s;hes, mu&s;cles, and &s;ea-gra&s;s; but, having neither cloaths nor lamp-oil, mu&s;t finally &s;tarve and freeze to death. This probably is one rea|&s;on why the Greenland people annually dimini&s;h. Nay, what is &s;till wor&s;e, if a mother dies, and leaves a &s;ucking babe, that cannot yet dige&s;t gro&s;s food, and there is no one to nur&s;e it, the father will frequently bury it alive with the mother. He does not do this but with the mo&s;t painful &s;en&s;ations, but nece&s;&s;ity drives him to it. Many an old, &s;ickly widow, that has no wealthy relations to &s;upport her, is al&s;o buried alive; and children will tell you that &s;he is thus re|lieved from a lingering death. Where per&s;ons have no friends at all, they will leave them to die unnoticed and unburied.</P>
<P>In criminal ca&s;es, where any occur, the proce&s;s is &s;till more di&s;orderly and &s;avage. No tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors are puni&s;hed with death but murderers, and per&s;ons &s;up|po&s;ed to be witches, and to have bewitched others to death. If the friends of the murdered man di&s;cover the murderer, they will &s;tifle their re&s;entment till an opportunity of revenge offers, which they never for|get,
<PB N="75" REF="80">
though at the di&s;tance of thirty or forty years, but will, when they meet the murderer alone, attack him, tell him the rea&s;on of their doing &s;o, &s;tab him, and throw his body into the &s;ea.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the Super&s;tition of the Greenlanders.</HEAD>
<P>TO &s;peak of the religion of the Greenlanders, we cannot, for they have none. Neither are they idolaters; but we may &s;ay &s;omething of their &s;uper|&s;tition, of which they have a great deal. They have &s;ome traditionary, confu&s;ed notions of the creation, the flood, and a future &s;tate; but they are &s;o enveloped in idle tales, as to bear very little affinity to the truth. Some have an idea of a Supreme being, from a con|viction that man could not be the maker of him&s;elf, and &s;uch as are ble&s;&s;ed with this notion, are readily converted to chri&s;tianity. The Moravians, who have a mi&s;&s;ionary at each colony, are taking great pains to inculcate among them go&s;pel-truths. Some of the&s;e people conceive they have two &s;ouls, viz. the &s;hadow and the breath of a man; and imagine, that in the night, when they dream, the volatile &s;hadow elopes from the body, and roams about hunting, dancing, vi&s;iting, and the like. It is this &s;ect that &s;upport a &s;et of conjurors, whom they call <HI>Angekoks;</HI> who pretend
<PB N="76" REF="81">
to have the art of repairing a maimed &s;oul, of bring|ing home a fugitive one, and changing a &s;ickly one for the &s;ound one of a rein-deer, a hare, a bird, or an infant. This doctrine of tran&s;migration of &s;ouls is particularly encouraged by helple&s;s widows, who, in order to allure the bounty of parents, will tell a father that the &s;oul of her decea&s;ed child is flown into his &s;on, or that the &s;oul of his decea&s;ed &s;on has taken up it's re&s;idence in one of her children. By thus impo&s;ing on his credulity, &s;he leads him to &s;uppo&s;e that he is related to her, and, of cour&s;e, will be her friend in future.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Geeenlanders think of the &s;oul as we do, and that it &s;urvives after death; but they differ much in their opinion with re&s;pect to the place or &s;ituation of a future &s;tate. Some &s;uppo&s;e it in the aby&s;&s;es of the ocean, as they draw their be&s;t &s;u&s;tenance from the bo&s;om of the &s;ea; others, conceive it is in the bowels of the earth, and that the caverns in the rocks are the avenues leading to it. There, &s;ay they, dwells <HI>Torngar&s;uk,</HI> (that is, the good &s;pirit,) and his mother (the evil one,) there, is a joyous, perpetual &s;um|mer, a &s;hining &s;un that never &s;ets; there, is the fair, limpid &s;tream, and a profu&s;ion of fowl, fi&s;hes, rein-deer, and &s;eals, all to be caught without toil; and none are admitted there but &s;uch as are dextrous and dili|gent, &s;uch as have ma&s;tered many whales and &s;eals, un|dergone great hard&s;hips, have been drowned at &s;ea, or died in child-bed. Others that are more charmed
<PB N="77" REF="82">
with the beauty of the heavenly bodies, carry their thoughts beyond the rainbow, &s;eek their paradi&s;e in the high empyreum, and conceive the flight of the &s;oul thither, to be &s;o rapid and ea&s;y, that it re&s;ts, the evening it departs, in the man&s;ion of the moon, who was a Greenlander, and dances with tho&s;e &s;portive &s;pirits, of which they &s;uppo&s;e the northern lights to con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The wi&s;er Greenlanders laugh at all this, and &s;ay, if there is &s;uch a luxurious paradi&s;e, where the &s;ouls of men &s;hall be entertained with hunting, it can only en|dure for a time; that they will afterwards be conveyed to more peaceful man&s;ions, of who&s;e nature they have no conception. They believe al&s;o in a hell, and &s;up|po&s;e it to be &s;ome &s;ubterraneous region, without light or heat, and filled with terror and anxiety. From the&s;e ideas, &s;uch people lead a regular life, and refrain from evil, through a principle of hope and fear.</P>
<P>The&s;e notions mu&s;t have ari&s;en from the truths of the patriarchal religion, handed down to po&s;terity by tradition, but veiled and blended with new additions, according to the di&s;tance of time, from the days of Noah. When we come to treat of the more northerly American Indians, and the A&s;iatic Tartars, between whom and the Greenlanders there is a pretty great re|&s;emblance in their notions, morals, and manners, and of whom we conceive the Greelanders to be a branch,
<PB N="78" REF="83">
we &s;hall &s;ee that the further the &s;avage nations wander|ed towards the north, the fewer of their ancient con|ceptions and cu&s;toms tliey retained. If the pre&s;ent natives of Greenland are thought to be a remnant of the old Norway chri&s;tians, which is not impo&s;&s;ible, they may have derived their notions from them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;oul of man, the Greenlanders conceive there are &s;uperior and inferior &s;pirits; of the fir&s;t, that there are two only, one good and one bad. <HI>Torngar|&s;uk</HI> is their good &s;pirit, and him whom the <HI>Angekoks,</HI> or conjurors, con&s;ult. The bad &s;pirit is a, female, &s;ome think <HI>Torngar&s;uk</HI>'s wife, and &s;ome his mother, who dwells under the &s;ea in a great man&s;ion, where &s;he can detain all the animals of the ocean, by her magic power.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Angekoks,</HI> or &s;ooth&s;ayers, have been in great repute among the Greenlanders, and men have had re|cour&s;e to a variety of arts, tricks, and deceptions, to gain the credit of a magician; but, when that credit is once obtained, they are applied to by all the credulous, to learn whether they &s;hall have a good or bad fi&s;hery, (which the&s;e people are able to judge of from the wea|ther) and to know how to act when they are &s;ick, and &s;o on. Sen&s;ible men, under the denomination of <HI>An|gekoks,</HI> may do &s;ome good, but there are many old hags who take up this profe&s;&s;ion, and who have no other means of gaining a livelihood; the mi&s;&s;ionaties,
<PB N="79" REF="84">
however, have of late &s;o expo&s;ed their arts and roguery, that they begin to grow into di&s;repute, and chri&s;tianity gains ground daily.</P>

clo&s;e this de&s;cription with &s;ome <HI>further</HI> account of the inhabitants on the ea&s;tern &s;ide, collected from the mouths of Greenlanders them&s;elves, as &s;et forth in <HI>Crantz</HI>'s hi&s;tory of that country; it is a kind of journal, told by a native, who came, among others, to vi&s;it at one of the Dani&s;h colonies in 1752.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e travellers, who, after he comes to Onar|tok, has five days journey to his own hou&s;e, and, con|&s;equently, lives 60 leagues up, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, from la|titude 65&deg;, told us, that he lodged two men la&s;t winter, who &s;aid, that they and a third had made a three year's excur&s;ion on the ea&s;t &s;ide in their womens'-boats. He could not tell us the native place or habitation of the&s;e &s;trangers, only, that it was very far di&s;tant from him, north-ea&s;tward. According to their account, they tarried the fir&s;t winter by the way; the &s;econd year they proceeded as far as the ice would permit them; and the third year they returned. They had been &s;o high on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, that the &s;un did not quite &s;et in &s;um|mer, but illuminated the mountains even at midnight, which agrees with the 66th deg. In their way, they were obliged, at times, to draw their tent and boat acro&s;s the ice, upon a &s;ledge, by dogs. They always kept under the coa&s;t, and never put far off to &s;ea, on account of the ice, though there was plenty of ice all under the land; but it is there &s;ooner di&s;&s;olved by the &s;un, and carried away by the current, than off at &s;ea. They gave us to under&s;tand, that the people on the ea&s;t &s;ide are bigger
<PB N="85" REF="90">
than tho&s;e on the we&s;t; that they have black hair, great beards, and look brown, like the re&s;t of the Greenlanders; that their dialect was nearly like their own, but with a kind of &s;inging tone; that they had neither trees nor gra&s;s, rein-deer nor hares, becau&s;e they did not touch on the main-land, but continued upon the i&s;lands; but that they had &s;een many &s;eals, whales, red-fi&s;h, &s;oles, eider|fowls, partridges and foxes, which con&s;tituted the food of the inhabitants, whom they reported as numerous and friendly; that they di&s;covered a fine inlet, and wi&s;hed to go up it, but were afraid of the canibals or men-eaters, &s;aid to dwell in tho&s;e parts. It is &s;uppo&s;ed there are, or were &s;uch a cla&s;s of &s;avages, for all Greenlanders have a dread of them. According to the opinion of this traveller, nece&s;&s;ity fir&s;t led them to this inhuman practice; being once reduced by a famine and a &s;evere winter; and, from reli&s;hing human fle&s;h, they had accu&s;tomed them|&s;elves to eat their dead, by laying them in a pit with other meat, and eating it raw, when half rotten and frozen. Even in time of dearth, unwilling to &s;laughter middle-aged per&s;ons, they put to death old people and for&s;aken orphans; and will, at &s;uch time, &s;pare their dogs in preference, on account of their u&s;efulne&s;s. They build their hou&s;es of &s;tone, like the we&s;tern Greenlanders, and lay wooden rafters on the walls, though wood there is very &s;carce. They dre&s;s like other natives, though their cloaths are not &s;o well made, having no iron needles. They had never &s;een a &s;hip,
<PB N="86" REF="91">
and had no boat with &s;ails; in other re&s;pects, their <HI>kajaks</HI> and womens' boats were like tho&s;e in other parts. He knew nothing of their religious notions, only, that they had <HI>Angekoks,</HI> or conjurers, there al&s;o.</P>
<P>A certain factor, &s;ays <HI>Crantz,</HI> al&s;o gave me the fol|lowing intelligence. In the year 1757, a man from the &s;outh wintered with us, and told us, that he had learned from &s;ome Greenlanders, who came from the ea&s;tern &s;ide, that there were people inhabiting a certain inlet between the mountains, who came down to the &s;ea-coa&s;t, every &s;pring, in great numbers; that the Greenlanders of tho&s;e parts fled always at their approach to the neighbouring i&s;lands; that tho&s;e who followed them could not get at them for want of boats, but &s;hot after them with arrows, which they carried on their backs in quivers; and that the&s;e men, having plundered and de&s;troyed their hou&s;es, retired into the mountains with the &s;poils.</P>
<P>If the&s;e reports can be relied on, it is probable, that the above-mentioned canibals and the&s;e men are one and the &s;ame people, who, de&s;cended from the old Norwegians, may have &s;heltered them&s;elves from the &s;avages, in the neighbouring mountains, continued their enmity out of revenge for the murder of their ance&s;|tors, ravaged them in the &s;pring, when provi&s;ions failed them, and were con&s;idered by the &s;avages, through
<PB N="87" REF="92">
exce&s;s of fear, as no other than canibals. Indeed, the women, in the we&s;t, often tattle to their children of mountain-&s;pirits, &s;ome &s;ixteen feet high, &s;ome &s;carce a foot in height, from whom the Europeans learned their arts; and about a people on the ea&s;tern-coa&s;t, who were man-eaters, and had a face like a dog.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE Northern Parts of America,</HI> Round <HI>HUDSON'S-BAY,</HI> the <HI>COAST</HI> of <HI>LABRADOR,</HI> and the <HI>COUNTRY</HI> of the <HI>ESKIMAUX INDIANS;</HI> by <HI>CAPT. ELLIS,</HI> who vi&s;ited that Part of the World in <HI>1746</HI> and <HI>1747.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN our account of Greenland, we acquainted our readers that it is &s;uppo&s;ed to join, on the north of Baffin's-bay, with the continent of America; for that the upper part of this bay is &s;o narrow, that the inhabitants on either &s;ide are able to call over to each other. Whether this be the fact or not, is not yet a&s;|certained, but it evidently appears from the per&s;ons and cu&s;toms of the natives on both &s;ides, that they are of one, and the &s;ame, origin; the Greenlanders there|fore, if the two countries do not join, mu&s;t have tra|velled acro&s;s the ice, and &s;ettled in tho&s;e northern parts. Under this idea, we cannot do better than give &s;ome account of this country here; the natives of the coa&s;t of Labrador, and further north, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>E&s;kimaux,</HI> being different from the Indians of America, more to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="94">The Labrador coa&s;t, and the parts of which we are now going to treat, are &s;ituated round Hud&s;on's bay; between the latitudes of 48 and 70 degrees. Captain <HI>Ellis,</HI> who &s;ailed in 1746, in &s;earch of a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age, from Hud&s;on's-bay to the great, we&s;tern ocean, wintered in a creek of this bay, near Nel&s;on's-river, in latitude 57deg. 30 m. He found the country co|vered with large woods, chiefly &s;pruce, fir, poplar, birch, larch, willow, &amp;c. and abounding with deer, hares, rabbits, gee&s;e, ducks, partridges, phea&s;ants, plovers, &s;wans, and many other &s;owl, in their proper &s;ea&s;on; as al&s;o, fi&s;h, in great plenty, and in as great variety.</P>
<P>But, the exceeding high mountains towards the north, continually covered with &s;now, and the winds blowing from thence, full three months of the year, occa&s;ion a degree of cold, over all this country, not felt in any other part of the world, in the &s;ame latitude. On the 2d of November, &s;ays he, we could not keep the ink from freezing at the fire. Our bottled beer froze &s;olid, though packed up in tow, and near a good fire. When the wind was we&s;terly, or &s;outherly, the cold was very &s;upportable, but, as it changed to the north-we&s;t, or north, it became immediately exce&s;&s;ively keen, and often attended with a &s;ort of &s;now, no larger than &s;o many grains of &s;and, which drifted with the wind in clouds, from every plain, or flat place, that lay ex|po&s;ed to it, &s;o as, in a very little time, to obliterate every
<PB N="90" REF="95">
track, and occa&s;ion people out in it to lo&s;e their way, and often their lives. Nature furni&s;hes every animal here with extraordinary furs, to re&s;i&s;t the cold; that gradually falls off as the warm weather returns. As in all the extremities of the body, the circulation of the blood is naturally &s;lower, being further from the heart, the &s;pring of it's motion, it follows, that the feet and tails of animals, are &s;oone&s;t apt to freeze. To remedy this inconvenience. Providence has ordained, that the animals of this country &s;hould have legs and tails &s;horter than tho&s;e of other countries. The cold, Captain <HI>Ellis</HI> ob&s;erves, was &s;o inten&s;e, the winter he was there, that, if any of his people touched iron, or any other &s;mooth, &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance, their fingers &s;tuck to it. In drinking a gla&s;s of brandy, if their lips, or tongue, touched the gla&s;s, they left part of their &s;kin behind, freezing to the gla&s;s. An odd in&s;tance of this &s;ort hap|pened to one of his men, who was carrying a bottle of &s;pirits, from the hou&s;e to his tent; for, not having a corK to &s;top the bottle, he made u&s;e of his finger, which &s;oon froze &s;o fa&s;t in the neck, that he was obliged to lo&s;e part of it, to make a cure practicable. They dug a hole, twelve feet deep, to &s;tow their liquor in, and found the ground very hard frozen, even at that depth. From this &s;everity of the weather, in the win|ter-&s;ea&s;on, it is natural to conclude, that the inhabitants mu&s;t be mo&s;t uncomfortable, and unhappy: but, this is by no means the ca&s;e; for, they have abundance of bea|ver-&s;kins to cloath them, and many other conveniences,
<PB N="91" REF="96">
which put them, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, on a level with tho&s;e who live in a milder climate.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, however, that they are not &s;ubject to greater hard&s;hips than Europeans, would be idle. Their con|dition is melancholy enough, though it does not make &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon them, as one would expect. As they have no idea of frugality, and make no provi&s;ion again&s;t times of &s;carcity, it &s;ometimes hap|pens, that the Indians, who come, in the &s;ummer, to trade at the new factories, mi&s;&s;ing of the &s;uccours they expected, have been obliged to &s;inge off the hair from thou&s;ands of beaver-&s;kins, in order to feed upon the leather. But, the greate&s;t hard&s;hips to which they are expo&s;ed, is, in their journies; for, it is a thing common with them, to travel two or three hundred miles, even in the depth of winter, through a wide, open country, without meeting with any hou&s;e to receive, or carrying any tent to protect, them. In &s;uch journies, it is their cu&s;tom, when night approaches, to rai&s;e a little kind of &s;ence, with bru&s;h-wood, to the leeward of which they make a fire, and, after clearing away the &s;now, they lie down upon the ground and &s;leep, between the fire and the fence. But if, as it &s;ometimes falls out, they happen to be benighted upon &s;ome wild plain, where no &s;uch &s;ence can be made, for want of wood, they are then forced to lie down under the &s;now, which proves &s;ome defence from the cold, and which is a thing
<PB N="92" REF="97">
practi&s;ed in the extremities of Siberia, where the cli|mate is not at all more temperate.</P>
<P>The native Indians, of this part, are of a middle &s;ize, copper-colour, with black eyes, and long, lank, black hair. They are of a chearful di&s;po&s;ition, good-natured, affable, friendly, and hone&s;t, in their dealings. They live in tents, covered with moo&s;e and deer-&s;kins, &s;ewed together; and, as their time is &s;pent chiefly in hunt|ing, fi&s;hing and fowling, they change their habitations, according to the plenty, or &s;carcity of game.</P>
<P>They do not live in any great numbers together, for the &s;ame rea&s;on; becau&s;e, it would be more difficult to provide nece&s;&s;aries to feed, and to clothe them; of cour&s;e, they have no body of laws to regulate their conduct, but are influenced, in their behaviour, by a natural rectitude of di&s;po&s;ition, that re&s;trains them from acts of violence and inju&s;tice. The chiefs in every family, or tribe (who are generally cho&s;en from among the mo&s;t ancient of the people, but chiefly for their &s;kill in hunting, and experience in trade, dome&s;tic affairs, or valour in war, which they often wage with the E&s;ki|maux, and of whom we &s;hall &s;peak hereafter), direct tho&s;e who re&s;ide with them, in their different employments of hunting, fi&s;hing, fowling, &amp;c. yet their advice is fol|lowed rather through deference, than obligation; for, in point of exemption from power, they may be, truly, called a free people.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="98">The clothing of the men here, in &s;ummer, is a loo&s;e coat, made of blanket, which they buy either from the French, or Engli&s;h, here &s;ettled; a pair of leather &s;tockings, which come &s;o high, as to &s;erve for breeches; and &s;hoes, of the &s;ame materials. The women's dre&s;s is the &s;ame; except that, in winter, they generally wear a petticoat, that reaches a little below the knee. Their ordinary apparel, is made of the &s;kin of deer, otter, or beaver, with the hair, or fur, on: the &s;leeves of their upper-habit, are frequently &s;eparate from the body of it, and taken off at plea&s;ure, being only tied with &s;trings at the &s;houlders; &s;o that, their arm-pits, even in the depth of winter, are expo&s;ed to the cold, which they conceive, contributes to their health. They have but few di&s;orders; and the&s;e chiefly ari&s;e from colds, taken after drinking &s;pirituous liquors, which they buy from the Engli&s;h, contrary to the wi&s;er maxims of the French, who &s;ell them none, and, of cour&s;e, keep them better in health, and more capable of trafficking.</P>
<P>They are pretty much &s;ubject to &s;ome di&s;orders in the brea&s;t, but to no contagious di&s;ea&s;es. Whenever they find them&s;elves indi&s;po&s;ed, they drink an infu&s;ion of the herb, called <HI>Wizzekapukka,</HI> &s;omething like rhu|barb; fi&s;h-broth, which they call <HI>Shaggamitie;</HI> or el&s;e &s;weat them&s;elves in their tents, and, in the mid&s;t of a profu&s;e &s;weat, plunge them&s;elves into cold water, or roll them&s;elves in the &s;now. For the cholick, they &s;wallow a great quantity of tobacco-&s;moke; and, if their
<PB N="94" REF="99">
head is di&s;ordered, force it out at their no&s;trils. In the &s;pring of the year, they will frequently become &s;now. blind, when a film grows over the eye. This they are ingenious enough to cut away, with the &s;harp point of a gun-flint.</P>
<P>In their drunken fits, they will often commit exce&s;&s;ive di&s;orders; &s;uch as quarrelling, burning their tents, and abu&s;ing their wives; but, when they are &s;ober, they are very courteous and compa&s;&s;ionate. Their affection for their children, is &s;ingularly great. The following is a remarkable in&s;tance of it, which happened at York|fort. Two &s;mall canoes, pa&s;&s;ing a river, when they had got to the middle of it, one of them, which was made of the bark of a birch-tree, &s;unk, in which was an Indian, his wife, and their child. The other canoe being &s;mall, and incapable of receiving more than one of the parents, and the child, produced a very extraordinary conte&s;t between the man and his wife; not, that both of them were willing to devote them&s;elves to &s;ave the other but the difficulty lay, which would be the greate&s;t lo&s;s to the child. The man u&s;ed many argu|ments, to prove it more rea&s;onable, that he &s;hould be drowned, than the woman; but &s;he alledged, on the contrary, it was more for the advantage of the child, that &s;he &s;hould peri&s;h, becau&s;e he, as a man, was better able to hunt, and con&s;equently to provide for it. The little time there was &s;till remaining, was &s;pent in mu|tual expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s; the woman &s;trongly re|commending,
<FIGURE>

<PB N="95" REF="101">
as for the la&s;t time, to her hu&s;band, the care of her child. This being done, they took leave, in the water; the woman, quitting the canoe, was drown|ed, and the man, with the child, got &s;afe a-&s;hore.</P>
<P>It is looked upon, among them, as a great offence, for the women to &s;tride over the legs of the men, when they &s;it on the ground; and they think it even beneath them to drink out of the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el with their wives. One cu&s;tom they have, which is very extraordinary; that when their parents grow &s;o old, as to be incapable to &s;upport them&s;elves by their own labour, they require their children to &s;trangle them, and this is e&s;teemed an act of obedience, in their children, to perform.&mdash; The manner of di&s;charging this la&s;t duty, is thus: The grave of the old per&s;on being dug, he goes into it, and, after having conver&s;ed and &s;moked a pipe, or perhaps drank a dram or two with his children, the old per&s;on &s;ignifies he is ready; upon which, two of the children put a thong about his neck, one &s;tanding on one &s;ide, and the other oppo&s;ite to him, and pull violently, till he is &s;trangled, then cover him with earth; and, over this, erect a kind of rough monument, with &s;tones. Such old per&s;ons, as have no children, reque&s;t this office of their friends; but it is not often complied with.</P>
<P>Their religious &s;entiments, Captain <HI>Ellis</HI> knew little of. All he could gather was, that their notions were very limited and imperfect. They acknowledge a Being
<PB N="96" REF="102">
of infinite goodne&s;s, whom they &s;tile <HI>Ukkewma,</HI> or, great-chief; they look upon him, as the author of all the benefits they enjoy; and &s;peak of him with reverence. They likewi&s;e &s;ing a kind of hymn in his prai&s;e, in a grave, &s;olemn tune, not altogether di&s;agreeable. They al&s;o acknowledge another being, as the in&s;trument of all kinds of mi&s;chief and evil, whom they call <HI>Wittikka,</HI> and of him they are very much afraid.</P>
<P>The language the&s;e people &s;peak is &s;omewhat gutteral in the pronunciation, but not har&s;h, or unplea&s;ant; they have but few words, and tho&s;e are very &s;ignificant.</P>
<P>They have a very &s;trong maxim of policy; that of &s;uffering, or rather obliging, their women, to procure frequent abortions, by the u&s;e of a certain herb; that they may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be ea&s;ed of that heavy burthen they feel, in providing for a helple&s;s family. Something of this &s;ort was practi&s;ed by the natives of Formo&s;a, when the Dutch became ma&s;ters of it. They differ al&s;o from almo&s;t all other nations in another par|ticular; which is, their manner of making water; for here, the men always &s;quat down, and the women &s;tand upright. We have already mentioned their animals; but, there is one thing we mu&s;t not omit, that here, as in all other &s;nowy regions, to protect them from their enemies, they become white in winter, when every thing, animate and inanimate, is of the &s;ame colour. And what is yet more &s;urpri&s;ing is, that dogs and cats,
<PB N="97" REF="103">
which have been carried from England to Hud&s;on's-bay, have, on the approach of winter, changed their appearance, and acquired a much longer, &s;ofter and thicker coat of hair than they originally had. The dogs of this country are as large as our ma&s;tiffs; they never bark, but growl when provoked. The Indians u&s;e their dogs as bea&s;ts of burden, for they have no other.</P>
<P>To pa&s;s over the Engli&s;h Hud&s;on's-bay company, when we are treating of this country, would be wrong. This bay is a va&s;t &s;ea, upwards of 400 leagues from north to &s;outh, and 300 leagues from ea&s;t to we&s;t, with a narrow pa&s;&s;age into it, like the Mediterranean. The company, which con&s;i&s;ts of about nine per&s;ons, and who have an exclu&s;ive trade in this bay, were chartered in 1670. They have four forts on the banks of it, viz. Churchill, Nel&s;on, New-Severn, and Albany, which &s;tand on the we&s;t &s;ide, and are garri&s;oned by 186 men. They employ four &s;hips and 130 &s;eamen, export com|modities to the value of &pound;. 16,000 yearly, and bring home returns to the amount of &pound;. 29,340, which yield to the revenue &pound;. 3,734. This includes the fi&s;hery there. Small as this commerce is, it affords immen&s;e profits to the company, and &s;ome advantages to Great-Bri|tain; for, what we &s;end there are the wor&s;t of our ma|nufactories, and the &s;kins and furs that are brought home, enable us to trade with many European nations to great advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="104">Within land, there are large plains in this country, but little herbage on them, except mo&s;s.

The boots of the women, about the &s;traits of Hud&s;on's-bay, reach up almo&s;t to their wai&s;t, and are made to project from the thigh with whalebone, for the convenience of carrying their children in them; whereas the women more to the &s;outhward, carry them, as do the Greenlanders, in their hood on their backs.

They have a very dex|trous method of kindling fire. To do this, they prepare two &s;mall pieces of dry wood, which, having made flat, they make a &s;mall hole in each, and, having fitted into the&s;e holes a little cylindrical piece of wood, to which a thong is fa&s;tened, they whirl it about with &s;uch ve|locity, that the motion &s;oon &s;ets them on fire; and then, by applying the lighted piece of wood to &s;ome

<HEAD>A A De&s;cription of ICELAND. From the Dani&s;h Original of <HI>N. Horrebow,</HI> who re&s;ided there two Years, <HI>Von Troil,</HI> and others.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Country in general.</HEAD>
<P>ICELAND is an i&s;land in the north-&s;eas, between Greenland and Norway, not farther than 40 miles di&s;tant from the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Greenland; it lies be|tween the latitudes of 63 and 67 degrees. Be&s;&s;e&s;ted, the chief place, lies in 64 deg. 4 m. north latitude, and 25 deg. we&s;t from the meridian of London, that is, 4 degrees farther ea&s;tward than it has been hitherto de|&s;cribed. It's extent has not been accurately a&s;cer|tained, but <HI>Horrebow</HI> computes it to be about 500 Engli&s;h miles, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and about 250 Engli&s;h miles from north to &s;outh. <HI>Von Troil</HI> computes it's length about 360 Briti&s;h &s;ea-miles, and 240 in breadth.
<PB N="104" REF="110">
However, it is ju&s;tly cla&s;&s;ed among the large&s;t i&s;lands in the known world, and is but little inferior in mag|nitude to the i&s;land of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The country does not afford a plea&s;ing view to the eye of a traveller, for it is uneven, covered with rocks and rugged mountains, and continually cloathed with ice and &s;now, with barren fields between them, de&s;ti|tute of wood, and encru&s;ted with lava for many miles.</P>
<P>It is cro&s;&s;ed in &s;everal directions by innumerable ridges of lofty mountains, highe&s;t in the centre, &s;o as to divide it into four quarters; and the&s;e mountains, with the rocks, re&s;emble tho&s;e in Norway, and a great part of Italy. The whole i&s;land &s;eems to have been laid wa&s;te by it's volcanoes. Some few i&s;lands, lying off the coa&s;t, are very fertile, and bear good gra&s;s, but they are not inhabited. Indeed, Iceland it&s;elf has but few inhabitants, there being neither towns or villages in any part of it, unle&s;s a few &s;cattered hou&s;es can be called a village. Farms, indeed, of &s;ome magnitude are met with throughout the whole interior part, except where the mountains interpo&s;e; and round each farm-hou&s;e are a few &s;traggling cottages, the dwellings of the te|nants, who procure from the proprietor a hou&s;e, and as much pa&s;ture-land as will keep them two or three hor&s;es and cows. The&s;e farms belong either to the king of Denmark, the church, or the pea&s;ants them&s;elves; and of the&s;e farms, of which there are 4,059 through|out
<PB N="105" REF="111">
out the i&s;land; 718 belonging to the king, 649 to the two bi&s;hops of Skallholt and Hoolum there re&s;iding, 780 to the clergy, 20 to the poor, and the re&s;t to the farmers them&s;elves. The value of a farm that will keep 10 hor&s;es, 10 cows, and 400 &s;heep; is about 120 rix-dollars, each dollar 4<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>In the interior parts, are very exten&s;ive heaths and plains, bounded by mountains, the greate&s;t part of which, are not &s;o difficult to pa&s;s as the Alps and Pyrenees, but have roads over them, where &s;ome hundreds of hor&s;es and men pa&s;s every year. The people of the north, travel acro&s;s the large chain of rocks that run along the country; and fetch their winter-&s;tock of dried fi&s;h from the &s;outh and we&s;t. On the top of &s;ome of the&s;e mountains, are plains, of the extent of 20 or 25 miles; and, in &s;everal parts of the i&s;land, are lakes, abounding with a variety of fine fi&s;h.</P>
<P>To be &s;en&s;ible of the dreadful effects of volcanoes in this i&s;land, the country it&s;elf need only to be con|&s;idered. The mountains are almo&s;t wholly compo&s;ed of lava, and the plains are cru&s;ted over with the &s;ame; but covered, in many &s;pots, with earth and turf. Large tracts of land have been laid wa&s;te by their irruptions; and their a&s;hes have frequently buried the fields, half a yard deep, and 20 or 30 miles in extent. In 1311, 22 farms were con&s;umed; and 70, in 1366. Mount Heckla, which is a volcano more tremendous than
<PB N="106" REF="112">
Ve&s;uvius, de&s;troyed two farms in 1374; &s;even, in 1390, and eighteen, in one day, in 1436.</P>
<P>Mount Heckla, the large&s;t vulcano in Iceland, is &s;een by all the &s;hips &s;ailing to Greenland and North America; it is &s;ituated it the &s;outh part of the i&s;land, about four miles from the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and is di|vided into three points at the top, the highe&s;t of which is in the middle, and is, according to exact ob&s;ervation, more than five thou&s;and feet above the level of the &s;ea. Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph Banks,</HI> Dr. <HI>Solander,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Von Troil,</HI> a&s;cended it in September, 1772. They rode on hor&s;eback to the fir&s;t opening from which the fire had bur&s;t, which, &s;ay they, is a place &s;urrounded with glazed walls add vitrified cliffs, that they knew not how to de&s;cribe. A little higher up they found a great quantity of grit and &s;tones, and &s;till farther on another opening not very deep, but where they ob&s;erved evident marks of hot, boiling water. As they a&s;cended higher, the mountain was covered with &s;now, and about 200 yards below the &s;ummit, they di&s;covered a hole of about four feet and a half diameter, from which &s;o hot a &s;team exhaled, that they could not a&s;certain the degree of heat by a thermometer they had with them.</P>
<P>When they reached the &s;ummit, which they did by climbing, they found a &s;pace of ground eight yards in breadth and twenty long, free from &s;now. The &s;and,
<PB N="107" REF="113">
however was wet, as if the &s;now had ju&s;t melted away. At this place, Fahrenheit's thermometer, when held in the air, &s;tood at 24, but, when &s;et on the ground, it ro&s;e to 153. The barometer was here at 22.247, and the thermometer at 38. It emitted &s;ome flames in the very month they vi&s;ited it, but &s;ent forth no lava.</P>
<P><HI>Ander&s;on,</HI> in his account of Iceland, tells us, that, about three Engli&s;h miles from Heckla, there is a &s;mall, fre&s;h-water lake, always warm, but rather hotter in the winter; and, according to accounts of people in the neighbourhood, endowed with the peculiar property of taking fire three times a year, and burning for about a fortnight, in &s;mall, bright flames: but, as neither <HI>Horre|bow</HI> nor <HI>Von Troil,</HI> who were both in this neighbour|hood, have mentioned this, it is to be doubted. Certain it is, that the country abounds with hot, &s;pouting water|&s;prings, (which we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;peak of,); and from a variety of mountains, who&s;e tops are covered with &s;now, flames of fire will often gu&s;h out. From &s;ome of the mountains al&s;o flow large and &s;mall rivers, which water the country below, and yield very fine fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Hot &s;prings are found in many parts of Iceland; from &s;ome the water flows gently, as from other &s;prings, and it is then called <HI>laug,</HI> that is, a bath; from others it &s;pouts boiling-water with a great noi&s;e, and is then called <HI>buer</HI> or <HI>kittel,</HI> (kettle). I have vi&s;ited, &s;ays <HI>Horrebow,</HI> many of the&s;e warm baths, but never found the lea&s;t
<PB N="108" REF="114">
appearance of &s;ulphur near them (though <HI>Von Troil</HI> &s;ays, he ta&s;ted &s;ulphur in them), nor do the waters ta&s;te of any mineral. Though the degree of heat, in the&s;e &s;prings, is unequal, I do not remember, &s;ays <HI>Von Troil,</HI> ever to have ob&s;erved it under 188 of <HI>Fahrenheit</HI>'s thermometer; in &s;ome places, we found it 193; at an|other, where the mo&s;t remarkable boiling fountain is, 213 degrees. If you fill a bottle at one of the&s;e &s;pouting &s;prings, &s;ays <HI>Horrebow,</HI> the water, contained in the bottle, will boil up two or three times, at the &s;ame time with the water in the well; and, if the bottles are corked up as &s;oon as filled, they will bur&s;t. This water, when cold, is plea&s;ant to drink; and cows, that drink of it, yield a greater proportion of milk. The inhabitants u&s;e the&s;e waters for various purpo&s;es; &s;ome u&s;e it for dying; others, boil their meat in in, by putting the meat in a ve&s;&s;el of cold water, and &s;etting it in the hot &s;pring; others, bend hoops, of great thickne&s;s, with it, and others, bathe in it, and wa&s;h with it.</P>
<P>Among the many hot &s;prings in Iceland, is one worth the attention of the curious; and we have given a plate, the better to de&s;cribe it. It is about two days jour|ney from Heckla, and makes its appearance in a large field, where, on one &s;ide, the eye is awfully &s;urpri&s;ed with high mountains, &s;een, at a great di&s;tance, covered with ice, who&s;e &s;ummits are lo&s;t in the clouds, &s;o that their &s;harp, unequal points, become invi&s;ible. Some|times, by particular winds, the clouds &s;hall &s;ink and en|wrap

<PB N="109" REF="116">
the mountains, leaving their &s;ummits only to view, appearing, as it were, to re&s;t upon the clouds. On the other &s;ide, the &s;ight is dreadful, awakened by the vol|cano Heckla, with its three points covered with ice, ri&s;ing above the clouds, and, with the &s;moke, a&s;cending from it, forming other clouds, at &s;ome di&s;tance, from the real ones; in one place is a ridge of high rocks, at the foot of which boiling water gu&s;hes forth; and, fur|ther on, a mar&s;h extends, about half a mile in circum|ference, where are 40 or 50 boiling &s;prings, from which a vapour a&s;cends, to a prodigious height, and, from &s;ome, water, four or five feet in height.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e &s;pouts, an enormous fountain of boiling water ri&s;es, by &s;tarts, at certain intervals, from 20 to 60 feet in height, attended with a &s;tupendous roar. The depth of the opening, from whence this water i&s;&s;ues, could not be a&s;certained; for, &s;ometimes, the water &s;unk down &s;everal fathoms, and &s;ome &s;econds pa&s;&s;ed before a &s;tone, that was thrown in, reached the &s;urface. The opening it&s;elf is perfectly round, 19 feet in diameter, and forming above, on the &s;urface of the ground, a ba&s;on, 59 feet in diameter, who&s;e edge is nine feet above the orifice, or hole.</P>
<P>The &s;trength of the vapour, that throws up this water, is exce&s;&s;ive. It not only prevents the &s;tones, thrown in, from &s;inking; but even ca&s;ts them up, with the water, to a very height.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="117">Ba&s;altine pillars, like the giant's-cau&s;eway, in Ire|land, are very common in Iceland, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been produced by &s;ubterranean fires; in &s;ome places, they extend two or three miles in length, without in|terruption.</P>
<P>Some have been of opinion, that the whole i&s;land was at once produced by fire; but this may be a ra&s;h conjecture; it has rather been the work of &s;ome cen|turies, by &s;everal cliffs and rocks being produced at different times, who&s;e points have been connected by new eruptions, and which have formed the ba&s;is of the whole i&s;land. It is certain that earthquakes here are very frequent, before the volcanos break forth. In September, 1755, fifteen violent &s;hocks were felt with|in a few days; and it is not uncommon to &s;ee whole farms over-turned by them, and large mountains bur&s;t a&s;under; but, by no means, does &s;uch direful de&s;truc|tion en&s;ue, as from earthquakes in other countries.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> On the Climate.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER all, Iceland is a healthy country to live in. The u&s;ual heat is not extreme, nor the cold in general very &s;evere. The air and weather,
<PB N="111" REF="118">
&s;ays <HI>Horrebow,</HI> will agree better with a &s;tranger, than the air and weather would with an Icelander in Den|mark. It is much &s;uch a climate as that of Denmark, with this difference, that the windy and &s;tormy wea|ther in Iceland is more frequent. In very cold &s;ea&s;ons, the mercury in the barometer has been 24 degrees be|low the freezing point, and at other times it has ri&s;en to 104 degrees.</P>
<P>Thunder and lightning here are very rare, and met with only in the neighbourhood of volcanoes, of which there are about twenty in the i&s;land. Northern-lights are uncommonly &s;trong, tinged with yellow, green, and purple; and vapours of the <HI>ignis-fatuus</HI> kind are often &s;een attaching them&s;elves to men and bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Icelanders reckon their &s;ummer from the mid|dle of April to the middle of October, and the re&s;t of the year with them is winter; no &s;pring or autumn; but it &s;nows and hails &s;ometimes in &s;ummer, as it does in Denmark; and, what is remarkable, a north-wind &s;eldom brings fro&s;t.</P>
<P>It never freezes to &s;uch a degree in Iceland, as to cover the &s;ea about the &s;hores with ice. The only ice that incommodes and hinders the inhabitants from put|ting out to &s;ea, is in the north, and is that which comes floating from Greenland; &s;ometimes &s;preading it&s;elf

<P>WHERE volcanoes, or burning mountains, are, there pumice-&s;tone is generally found; of cour&s;e, there is plenty in Iceland. It al&s;o abounds with ores, iron, copper and &s;ilver; but they are never &s;ought after. The mountains contain ro&s;in, pitch, and other bituminous matter. Sulphur is never found above ground; but there is plenty beneath the &s;urface. About three feet under ground, in many places, ten tons weight may be collected in an hour's time. On account of the heat of the ground, under which it lies, the la|bourers dig for it in the &s;ummer-nights, and tie woollen rags about their &s;hoes, to keep them from burning. When the brim&s;tone is fir&s;t taken out, it is &s;o hot, that it &s;carcely can be handled. If they clear out a vein of &s;ulphur, it will fill again in two or three years, &s;o &s;ur|pri&s;ing is its vegetation. There are, al&s;o, many &s;alt-&s;prings, in this i&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="120">Fore&s;ts and wood are very &s;carce in this country; but it is not without trees. Mo&s;t farms have &s;mall nur&s;eries adjoining; but they do not grow to any &s;ize. Want of wood is, however, compen&s;ated, by the great quantites of fine, large timber, that every year comes floating a&s;hore. Of this, they have more than they know how to di&s;po&s;e of; but they have no &s;uch thing as a fir, pine, or other trees, growing there. They have &s;ome &s;mall birch, and &s;hrubs, &s;uch as juniper and black|berry; of which they make charcoal, for their forges. In &s;everal places, roots of trees have been found in the ground; which leads us to &s;uppo&s;e, woods have &s;tood, where, now, not a tree is &s;een.&mdash;A very extra|ordinary &s;ort of wood is al&s;o met with, which they call <HI>Sortebrand,</HI> or, black brand; it is hard, heavy and black, like ebony; generally found deep under ground, in long, broad, thin leaves, fit to make tables; keeps well in water, and never rots; but, no &s;ooner is it expo&s;ed to the air, than it drops a&s;under, into pieces. The &s;miths burn it, as charcoal.</P>
<P>All over the i&s;land are &s;een &s;pacious tracts of good pa&s;ture for cattle, where they will grow exceedingly fat. Every farm has a meadow, or piece of ground, which they call, <HI>Tun.</HI> It is watched by dogs, that no cattle may come near it; being manured, in the be&s;t manner they can, for hay.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="121">All kinds of things may be produced here, proper for a kitchen garden, for they have a great deal of good ground; and for the two winters, &s;ays <HI>Horrebow,</HI> I &s;taid in Iceland, the weather, in the &s;outh part of the country, was not &s;everer than at Copenhagen. They have &s;ome piercing, north-winds, but nothing to ob|&s;truct vegetation. In the year 1749, when I came to Be&s;&s;e&s;ted, I found the king's garden in excellent order; full of all kinds of vegetables, &s;uch as par&s;ley, cellery, thyme, marjorum, cabbage, par&s;neps, carrots, turneps, peas, beans, and all &s;orts of greens wanted in a family, and of good growth, and excellent flavour. They have, al&s;o, fine goo&s;eberry-trees; and, were other fruit-trees planted, there is no doubt but they would bear fine fruit. The greate&s;t difficulty is, to get the trees over, at a proper &s;ea&s;on for planting. Ships do not leave Den|mark, for this place, till May; and then, all fruit-trees are in blo&s;&s;om. That the fruits of the earth are not equally fine in all parts of Iceland, is not owing to the &s;oil, or air, but the ignorance of the people; it being &s;aid, there are not 10 gardens in the whole country.</P>
<P>Now, ground that will produce garden-fruit, will produce corn; and, formerly, farmers &s;owed it for their own u&s;e; but, none is grown now: there is a pro&s;pect, however, of recovering this hu&s;bandry, for, the king of Denmark, has &s;ent able hu&s;bandmen to introduce it, and in&s;truct the inhabitants in managing and cultivat|ing their land. Their &s;ummers are not long, but their
<PB N="115" REF="122">
vegetation is quick; gra&s;s will run up two feet high, in 12 or 14 days; and, as in Lapland, where it is much colder, they &s;ow, reap, and gather in their harve&s;t, in the &s;pace of &s;ix or &s;even weeks; they would, cer|tainly, do the &s;ame here.</P>
<P>There is a weed, or vegetable, that grows in the &s;ea, which the Icelanders call <HI>&s;ol;</HI> and the cattle are very fond of, and thrive well on it: even the peo|ple eat it. Coral is al&s;o found in the &s;ea; and a coral|fi&s;hery might be here e&s;tabli&s;hed, with &s;ucce&s;s and profit.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of Animals.</HEAD>
<P>OF wild, four-footed animals, there are but two &s;orts; bears and foxes. Bears are not natives of this i&s;land, but come annually from Greenland, on the floating ice. But the people give them a very unwel|come reception: no &s;ooner is a bear &s;een on the land, or his track noticed, but they pur&s;ue him, nor do they quit their pur&s;uit, till they have found and de&s;troyed him. They u&s;e &s;pears, upon this occa&s;ion; and, though a bear will turn upon his pur&s;uer, yet, by throwing a glove in his way, they will &s;oon be able to di&s;patch him,
<PB N="116" REF="123">
for he will not &s;tir, till he has turned even every finger of it in&s;ide out; and, as he is not very dextrous with his paws, this takes him &s;ome time, and gives his pur|&s;uer either time to e&s;cape, or an opportunity of killing him; be&s;ides, government gives a reward of 10 dol|lars, for every bear that is killed; and purcha&s;es the hide, of the killer.</P>
<P>Of wild foxes, there are great plenty; generally of a dark-red colour, but &s;ome few black, &s;ome white, and others grey. The&s;e, the Icelanders take &s;ome pains to de&s;troy, by gins and traps; as government, in order to root them out, gives a rix-dollar for every 10 &s;kins &s;old to a merchant.</P>
<P>Of tame animals, they have hor&s;es, oxen, cows, &s;heep, goats, and hogs. Their hor&s;es are properly of the Norwegian breed; &s;trong, lively, bri&s;k, and tame to admiration. They have &s;ome wild hor&s;es on the moun|tains; very wild indeed, that will fly at the people when they offer to catch them; but, when tamed, no animals are more gentle.</P>
<P>The cattle, both cows and bullocks, are not very large, but very fat and fine. There are as many here without horns, as with. Cows yield a great deal of milk; &s;ome, will give 20 quarts a-day; but, others, not more than 10. Sheep, as well as &s;addle-hor&s;es, are kept in &s;tables, in the winter; when farmers keep their
<PB N="117" REF="124">
cows in their yards, and feed them with hay, in pro|portion to their &s;tock. When hay is &s;carce, they u&s;e their cows to eat fi&s;h-bones boiled &s;oft, and drink the water they are boiled in, which they not only like, but thrive on. It is common to meet with oxen running wild about the mountains; which, however, are brought home in autumn, as every one knows his own, by a pe|culiar mark.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tomary price of a cow, is about 120 ells of Wadmel, a kind of baize, by which every article is va|lued and &s;old. Thirty of the&s;e ells are valued at 4<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> Engli&s;h; &s;o, that a cow is worth 18<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>But, there is no breed of cattle &s;o much attended to, in Iceland, as their &s;heep; and, there are many pea&s;ants, who have from two to four hundred. The &s;heep differ from ours, in &s;everal particulars: they have &s;trait ears, &s;tanding upright, a &s;mall tail, and four or five horns. Every farmer is provided, with &s;tables and folds, &s;uffi|cient for a flock of &s;heep; where they are &s;heltered in the winter, and fed on hay. In &s;tormy, tempe&s;tuous weather, when the &s;heep are out, they will hide them|&s;elves in caves and holes in the mountains; but, when they cannot find any retreat during a heavy fall of &s;now, they gather together in a heap, with their heads in the middle, and bent towards the ground; &s;o that, if they are buried in the &s;now, the owner knows where to find them; at which time they will eat the wool from each
<PB N="118" REF="125">
others backs. In a &s;torm of wind, in &s;ummer-time, whole flocks have been carried away, 60 or 70 Engli&s;h miles; and often driven into the &s;ea, where they have peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>Good &s;heep give from two to &s;ix quarts of milk a-day; of which, as well as cow's milk, butter and chee&s;e is made. But, the principal profit they derive from their &s;heep, is wool. They do not &s;heer it, as we do; but, about the end of May, when it gets loo&s;e, &s;trip it off, at once, like a &s;kin. The outer wool is &s;omething like camel's hair, but more &s;haggy, de&s;igned, by Nature, to enable them to &s;up|port the rigours of the winter. Under this wool, is a fre&s;h coat, of finer. The price of &s;ix ewes, from two to four years old, is about 18<HI>s.</HI> Engli&s;h. The &s;hepherds that guard them are &s;o expert, that, at one view, in a flock of two or three hundred, they can tell whether any are mi&s;&s;ing, or whether any &s;trange &s;heep are got in among them. As the rams are &s;uffered to run about among the ewes; to prevent un&s;ea&s;onable leaping, they tie a cloth under their bellies, which is taken off towards Chri&s;tmas.</P>
<P>As goats do not thrive well where there is little or no wood, they are not very general in this i&s;land; the few there are, yield a great &s;tore of milk.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="126">The old annals of this country prove, that it was formerly &s;tocked with a great number of hogs; but there is no great quantity now.</P>
<P>Dogs and cats are in plenty, e&s;pecially the former; &s;carce a family being without two, or three, a hou&s;e-dog, and others, to attend their &s;heep.</P>
<P>Of birds of prey, they have eagles, falcons, hawks, and ravens. Owls and kites, crows and magpies, there are none. The Iceland falcons are the be&s;t for &s;port: the king of Denmark &s;ends, every year, a falconer, with two attendants, to buy them up.</P>
<P>Of wild fowl, they have woodcocks, &s;nipes, ouzels, and partridges, in abundance; but no quails: of com|mon fowls, chickens, ducks, pidgeons, &amp;c. as in other countries. Here is al&s;o plenty of wild ducks; and a profu&s;ion of coa&s;t-birds, that will &s;tray out to &s;ea, in large flights, to the di&s;tance of 30 or 40 leagues. It is the large quantity of fi&s;h the&s;e &s;eas are &s;tocked with, that occa&s;ions &s;uch flocks of birds to harbour here. There are, al&s;o, wild gee&s;e, and &s;wans.</P>
<P>The &s;wan is a con&s;tant inhabitant of this i&s;land: great numbers of them frequent the fre&s;h rivers, up the country, and breed there, and the natives make great profit of their down and feathers; &s;o do they of the eider-down, of which we made &s;ome mention in our
<PB N="120" REF="127">
account of Greenland. The eider-ducks generally build their ne&s;ts in little i&s;lands, made on purpo&s;e to invite them, where they will &s;warm, if not di&s;turbed; nay, they will become &s;o tame, as to &s;uffer people to come about them and take away their eggs, whil&s;t they are &s;itting. When the&s;e birds build their ne&s;t, they pluck the fine down from their brea&s;ts, to line them. When their eggs and down are removed, they go to work again, new-line their ne&s;ts, and lay more; and, when the ne&s;ts are robbed a &s;econd time, and the duck has no more down, the drake &s;upplies it. This is not removed, till the young ones are hatched, and flown. One female, during the whole time of laying, will give half a pound of down. There are generally exported, every year, on the company's account, 1500 or 2000 pounds of down, exclu&s;ive of what is privately exported. In the year 1750, the Iceland company &s;old as much, in quantity, as came to &pound;.842 &s;terling. Of this bird, the female is the &s;ize of a common Engli&s;h duck; the drake, the &s;ize of a goo&s;e. As &s;oon as their young are hatched, they run out after the duck; and, when &s;he gets to the water-edge, &s;he takes them on her back, and &s;wims away with them; and, when at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;hore, &s;he dives, and leaves the young ones &s;wimming, to &s;hift for them&s;elves, and &s;wim after her.</P>
<P>Too much cannot be &s;aid of the great ble&s;&s;ing God has be&s;towed on this i&s;land, in the immen&s;e mul|titudes
<PB N="121" REF="128">
of fi&s;h which &s;warm the coa&s;ts, from the north|ern parts of Iceland, in their pa&s;&s;age to the &s;outhern. In &s;ome places, there is good cod-fi&s;hing all the year round.</P>
<P>Herrings come from the mo&s;t northern parts, where they breed, and &s;end forth va&s;t colonies to all Europe, at certain &s;ea&s;ons. In pa&s;&s;ing by Iceland, they are cha&s;ed by the whales, and large fi&s;h, into the bays and creeks, in &s;uch multitudes, that a boat can hardly be rowed among them; and they may be taken up by pails full. But the Icelanders do not apply them&s;elves to the her|ring-fi&s;hery, having neither materials for it, nor a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;alt. Small herrings are food for cod-fi&s;h; and the birds, al&s;o, &s;nap them up. The whale, al&s;o, &s;wallows them in heaps. Once, in par|ticular, a whale, &s;ays <HI>Horrebow,</HI> pur&s;uing his prey too greedily, ran a-ground; and, the tide &s;etting out, left him helple&s;s on the &s;hore. The inhabitants &s;oon gave him his quietus; and found, in his belly, upwards of 600 fine live cod, a great quantity of herrings, and &s;ome birds.</P>
<P>In proper fi&s;hing-places, a variety of other fi&s;h is caught, be&s;ides cod; namely, trout, &s;oles, flounders, haddock, whiting, turbot, &s;kate, &s;almon, and &s;almon-trouts. The inhabitants dry cod-fi&s;h all the &s;ummer; and, the Dani&s;h merchants, in Iceland, pickle many hundred ca&s;ks of cod annually, and export it to Copenhagen.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="129">They catch, al&s;o, in the Iceland &s;eas, &s;eals and whales, of all &s;orts.</P>
<P>As to vermin, no country on the globe is le&s;s trou|bled with it: rats and mice, indeed, they have in plenty; &s;piders there are a few; but no beetles, hor&s;e|flies, nor &s;nakes of any kind. The only trouble&s;ome things, are gnats; travellers, however, by hanging gauze over their faces, keep them off.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the People.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH there is &s;carce any country &s;o little fa|voured by Nature, and where &s;he appears through|out in &s;o dreadful a form, yet Iceland contains about 60,000 people; who cannot properly be called un|happy, though they are unacquainted with &s;ome of the comforts of life.</P>
<P>The Icelanders are middle-&s;ized, and well-made, though not very &s;trong; and the women are, in general, ill-featured, but have white, &s;ound teeth. Whil&s;t children, they are kept very tender; but, when the lads are big, and &s;trong enough to row a boat, and to go a-fi&s;h|ing, they mu&s;t then enter upon a &s;cene of toil and labour. An Icelander's &s;trength continues only from the age of 20 to 50; at which time, it begins to decay. The
<PB N="123" REF="130">
many hard&s;hips they endure, when fi&s;hing, bring on con&s;umptions and a&s;thmas, which are reigning di&s;orders here. They make nothing of jumping into the &s;ea, to &s;ave their boats from running a-ground, or receiving damage again&s;t the rocks; and, frequently, keep on their wet cloaths, even in fro&s;t and &s;now. It is very rare to &s;ee any one reach the age of 100, or even 80. The women are not u&s;ed to any heavy exerci&s;e, or hard labour; for, excepting the hay-harve&s;t, their other work is chiefly done while &s;itting; &s;uch as cleaning and combing of wool, &s;pinning, knitting, weaving, &amp;c. of cour&s;e, they are delicate, tender, and chilly. They have frequently hard labours, and many die in child|birth. In their be&s;t times, they generally keep their beds, unmoved, eight days; and many &s;uffer, their whole lives, through the ignorance of their midwives.</P>
<P>Cholics, con&s;umptions, and hypochondriac di&s;orders, are very epidemical among them, and would employ a number of phy&s;icians, if the poor could afford to pay them; but, the lepro&s;y is the mo&s;t prevailing di&s;ea&s;e, which continues with them, till worn out with hard labour and age. When the Icelanders are taken ill, they re&s;ign them&s;elves to God and nature; few, among them, having any medicines, or knowledge how to ap|ply them. There is, however, an apothecary's &s;hop e&s;tabli&s;hed in the i&s;land, and four ho&s;pitals for the poor and leprous, attended by &s;kilful phy&s;icians and a&s;&s;i&s;tants.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="131">When children are put to the brea&s;t, they are &s;uf|fered to &s;uck as long, as u&s;ual, in other countries; but, for the greater part, they are brought up by hand. They give them the be&s;t milk, not &s;kimmed; and never, when turned into whey. Indeed, they are &s;o carefully and tenderly nur&s;ed, that they are all &s;trait and well-limbed; &s;carce a cripple to be &s;een among them.</P>
<P>There are no &s;chools, nor indeed can there well be any, the hou&s;es being &s;cattered at &s;uch a di&s;tance from one another; but parents, and &s;uch of the family as are qualified, in&s;truct young children in reading the ar|ticles of their religion; and the clergy, in vi&s;iting their pari&s;hioners, examine, and prepare them for con|firmation. They are kept always at home, whil&s;t young; and &s;ee no other examples than their parents &s;et them, which are not vicious.</P>
<P>The Icelanders are of a good, hone&s;t di&s;po&s;ition; but they are, &s;ays <HI>Von Troil,</HI> at the &s;ame time, &s;o &s;erious and &s;ullen, that I &s;carcely remember to have &s;een any one of them laugh. The annals of the country &s;hew that, in ancient times, they were a warlike people, having, in a civil war, made great &s;laughter among them|&s;elves: however, as at pre&s;ent, this country cannot &s;pare many of its inhabitants; and as, fortunately for them, it is too remote for officers to go recruiting, few of them have been trained up in a military line. In
<PB N="125" REF="132">
the &s;ea-&s;ervice, &s;ome of them have been promoted to the command of Dutch ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Vices are, indeed, much le&s;s common among them than in other parts, where riches and luxury have cor|rupted the morals of the people. Theft is &s;eldom heard of; nor are they inclined to incontinence.</P>
<P>Though their poverty renders them incapable of following, in many re&s;pects, the ho&s;pitality of their an|ce&s;tors; yet they do it, where they can. They chear|give away the little they have to &s;pare; and expre&s;s the utmo&s;t &s;ati&s;faction, if you are plea&s;ed with their gift. In general, they are not chearful in conver&s;ation, but &s;imple and credulous; and have no objection to a bottle of &s;trong liquor, if they can get it.</P>
<P>The Icelanders have made very few alterations, if any, in their dre&s;s, in modern times. It is not elegant, or ornamental, but yet neat, cleanly, and &s;uitable to the climate. Their out&s;ide garments are, generally, a coar&s;e, black baize, which they call <HI>Wadmel.</HI> The men wear a linen &s;hirt, with a &s;hort &s;eaman's jacket, and a wide pair of breeches, or trow&s;ers, over it. When they travel, they wear another &s;hort coat over all. On their head, they wear large three-cornered hats; and, on their legs, wor&s;ted &s;tockings, and Icelandic &s;hoes, which con|&s;i&s;t of a &s;quare piece of leather, rather wider than the length of the foot; this is &s;ewed up at the toes, and
<PB N="126" REF="133">
behind at the heel, and tied on with leather thongs, The women are dre&s;&s;ed, al&s;o, in black <HI>Wadmel</HI> (though, on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land, they are &s;een in white cloaths). They wear a boddice over their &s;hifts, which are &s;ewed up at the bo&s;om; and, above this, a jacket, laced before, with long, narrow &s;leeves, to the wri&s;ts. In the opening, on the &s;ide of the &s;leeve, they have cha&s;ed buttons, with a plate fixed to each button, on which, the bridegroom, when he buys them, in order to pre&s;ent to his bride, takes care to have his name and her's engraved. At the top of the jacket, a little black, &s;tiff collar, is fixed; of about three inches broad, of velvet, or &s;ilk, and frequently trimmed with gold cord. The petticoat is likewi&s;e of <HI>Wadmel,</HI> and reaches to the ancles; round the top of it is a girdle, or belt, &s;et round with &s;ilver, or &s;ome other metal, buttoned and cla&s;ped before, to which they fa&s;ten the apron, which is al&s;o of <HI>Wadmel,</HI> and ornamented at the top with three great, cha&s;ed, filligree buttons, before. Over this jacket, they wear an upper garment, like a loo&s;e, wide coat, clo&s;e at the neck, under the collar of the jacket, with narrow &s;leeves, that reach to the wri&s;ts. The&s;e coats are, al&s;o, of <HI>Wadmel,</HI> and a hands-breadth &s;horter than the pet|ticoat. It is adorned with a facing (&s;omething like cut, black velvet, woven by the women) down to the very bottom. Their jackets are made to &s;it neat and clo&s;e to the wai&s;t, and are laced, in all the &s;eams, with co|loured ribbands. On their fingers, they wear many gold, &s;ilver, or bra&s;s rings. About their heads, they tie
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="134">
<HEAD>ICELANDERS.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="127" REF="135">
a coar&s;e, white, linen handkerchief, and over that an|other finer, formed like a tuft on the top of the head, and a foot and a half high. Over this, and under the chin, they tie a &s;ilk handkerchief; the poorer women u&s;e a cotton one. This kind of head dre&s;s is worn by all women, &s;ingle or married; and, round their necks, they have u&s;ually another &s;ilk, or cotton handkerchief. In &s;hort, their dre&s;s much re&s;embles what is met with in old pictures, or monuments in churches, except the head-dre&s;s. The young girls wear caps; but, when grown up, change them for the&s;e high heads. A bride, on her wedding-day, in&s;tead of a &s;ilk handkerchief, wears a crown of &s;ilver, under the linen tuft that &s;tands &s;o high upon her head. She wears, al&s;o, two &s;ilver chains; one hanging down very low before, and the other re&s;ting on her &s;houlders behind. Be&s;ides the&s;e, &s;he wears a le&s;&s;er chain on the neck, from which a heart generally hangs, and in which &s;ome perfume is put. But, during the&s;e &s;olemnities, the great coat is never worn. Several of the Iceland ladies wear trinkets, to the amount of three or four hundred rix-dollars; and the&s;e make their dre&s;s of broad-cloth, in&s;tead of <HI>Wadmel.</HI> As for lawyers, and gentlemen in civil em|ploys, they dre&s;s in the modern fa&s;hion, as they do at Copenhagen, with full &s;uits, lined with &s;ilk.</P>
<P>The inhabitants who live near the &s;ea, employ them|&s;elves, the year round, chiefly in fi&s;hing. Every ma&s;ter of a family, furni&s;hes his &s;ervant with a particular dre&s;s,
<PB N="128" REF="136">
made of leather, rubbed over with oil; the breeches and &s;tockings are of one piece, and come up pretty high above the hips, and are laced on very tight; a wide jacket, fa&s;tened round the neck, and middle of the wai&s;t, with water-&s;hoes of thick leather, completes it: this, however, is never worn, but at &s;ea.</P>
<P>Their boats are commonly &s;mall, holding from one man to four; with the&s;e they fi&s;h near the coa&s;t: but they have &s;ome that will hold 12 or 16 men, and with the&s;e they venture &s;ix or eight miles out at &s;ea. As &s;oon as their boat is &s;hoved off from &s;hore, they take off their hats and caps, pray for good &s;ucce&s;s, and recommend them&s;elves, by a prayer and hymn, to the Divine protection. On their return, they divide the fi&s;h they have caught, equally among them; re&s;erv|ing one &s;hare for the owner of the boat, though perhaps not pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Men, women and children, when they have nothing el&s;e to do, e&s;pecially in winter, work at the cleaning, twining, and &s;pinning of wool. Some Dani&s;h weavers have lately come among them; and they begin now to improve con&s;iderably in the art of weaving. Having had no fulling-mills, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, that they have had much trouble in fulling and milling all the woollen goods made on the i&s;land, when it is known, that they have u&s;ed no other means, than a ca&s;k or barrel, with both ends out, and, when the articles to be milled, are
<PB N="129" REF="137">
put in, two men &s;it down oppo&s;ite to each other with their feet in the ca&s;k, and thus work the &s;tuff about. Gloves and mittens they put on when going to &s;ea, and, dipping them in &s;ea-water, mill them on their hands as they row. To full breeches and &s;tockings, they put them on likewi&s;e, and rock them&s;elves about with them, by which means they have contracted a habit of perpetual rocking and moving their limbs about, when they have no &s;uch work to do. Women wa&s;h their things generally with urine, u&s;ing neither &s;oap nor lye. In the bu&s;ine&s;s of dying, they extract verdegrea&s;e with urine from copper ve&s;&s;els with which they dye their yarn, and weave pretty &s;triped woollen &s;tuffs of various colours. They are al&s;o not without ingenuity; as a proof of this, we need only mention that a pea&s;ant con|trived, &s;ome years ago, a &s;ledge in the form of a &s;hip with &s;ails, large enough to contain four or five per&s;ons, that would &s;ail in the winter-time on the &s;now in an even country.</P>
<P>The many ingenious Icelanders &s;o eminent in the li|terary world, is a &s;trong in&s;tance of their good natural parts. Every year, &s;ome of their &s;elect youths are &s;ent to the univer&s;ity of Copenhagen, where they di&s;cover &s;uch a &s;pirit of emulation, as dull per&s;ons are &s;eldom ob&s;erved to have. And the common people have keen cunning heads, and a great deal of mother wit. They have, like mo&s;t other nations, a &s;trong propen&s;ity to their native place, &s;ome however e&s;tabli&s;h them|&s;elves

at Copenhagen, and in other foreign countries, and &s;ettle there as profe&s;&s;ors, rectors, &s;ea-faring people, gold&s;miths, and a variety of handicraft occupations. At the bi&s;hop's &s;eat at Hoolum, there was an Icelander, in 1750, that under&s;tood the art of printing to perfec|tion, having learned it at Copenhagen. And with re|&s;pect to indu&s;try, the Icelanders are as diligent in their &s;everal occupations as mo&s;t people, never neglecting or omitting any thing that ought to be done. Though the common people are rather too much wedded to their old cu&s;toms, they are fond of &s;eeing curio&s;ities and improving them&s;elves; are very ready to imitate, very handy at making any thing, and very expert at turning things to advantage.</P>
<P>It is not at Copenhagen alone, that they are thus found ingenious, the people in the country are con&s;pi|cuous for like abilities. Many men in Iceland, have, without the in&s;tructions of a ma&s;ter, taught them&s;elves to work in &s;ilver and bra&s;s. There are al&s;o ingenious carpenters, joiners, and &s;miths. They have no time-pieces among them except hour-gla&s;&s;es; but they cal|culate time pretty exactly by the &s;un or &s;tars when vi|&s;ible, or by the tide which is always regular. Of cour&s;e, they never count time by the clock as one, two, three, four o'clock, but have particular names in their own language for every hour and half hour in the day,

They have no floors but the ground one, and their windows in&s;tead of gla&s;s are compo&s;ed of thin membranes &s;tretched on frames which admit of light. They have no chimneys, never making a fire but to dre&s;s their food, in which ca&s;e they burn turf on the ground.

<P>Their food principally con&s;i&s;ts of dried fi&s;h, &s;our but|ter, which they con&s;ider as a dainty, milk mixed with water and whey, and a little meat. As no hu&s;bandry is followed in Iceland, bread mu&s;t be &s;carce; the major part of what is con&s;umed, is purcha&s;ed by the better kind of people, and imported from Denmark. There is &s;carely any pea&s;ant that eats it three or four months in the year. As a &s;ub&s;titute for bread, they eat dried fi&s;h, well beaten (but not boiled,) and &s;pread with but|ter. They however convert &s;ometimes wild-corn that grows in &s;ome places, into flour and bread, and make a kind of flour al&s;o of rock-gra&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="142">To give the reader &s;ome idea of their cookery, we will tell him, they boil their fi&s;h in &s;ea-water, eat their meat without &s;alt, and make broth by boiling their meat in four whey of a year old. Their kitchen uten|&s;ils they have from Copenhagen, and they are in ge|neral neat, and cleanly in their kitchens. The Ice|landers in common eat two meals a day; morning and evening. They u&s;ually eat curds mixed with new milk, and &s;ometimes with juniper berries. And at dinner, they eat dried fi&s;h, with plenty of &s;our butter, or fre&s;h fi&s;h, and, if they can get it, bread and chee&s;e.</P>
<P>Their common drink is water, but they occa&s;ionally drink milk, butter-milk, or &s;our whey, and &s;uch as can afford it import beer and wine.</P>
<P>In &s;o mountainous and rocky a country, where there is no agriculture and but little commerce, we cannot expect good roads; they neither make u&s;e of carts nor &s;ledges; but, when they are obliged to travel to &s;ea|ports in order to exchange their fi&s;h, &amp;c. for other commodities, they take 20, 30 or a greater number of hor&s;es with them, each of which will carry from 300 to 400 lb. weight. The conductor of this cavalcade rides on before, and his dog by a certain word, runs after the &s;traggling hor&s;es and keeps them together. They never take any food with them for the hor&s;es, there being plenty of pa&s;ture all the way.</P>

<P>The number of inhabitants is by no means propor|tionable to the extent of the country. It was much more populous formerly, but a pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e called the <HI>Sorte d&ouml;d,</HI> or black death, that raged from 1402 to 1404, almo&s;t &s;wept away every &s;oul from the i&s;land; many places have been entirely depopulated by famine, and in the years 1707 and 1708, the &s;mall-pox de&s;troyed 16,000 per&s;ons. This black death, in the year 1402, &s;carce left a per&s;on to relate the dreadful calamity, it has accordingly been omitted in the annals of Iceland; in which nothing el&s;e remarkable is omitted. The few who e&s;caped that great deva&s;tation &s;aved them&s;elves by taking refuge in the mountains, and by tradition re|late, that the low and flat country was covered with a thick fog during the time of this plague. This di&s;ea&s;e extended it&s;elf to Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, and carried off &s;o many thou&s;ands in tho&s;e countries, that they could not &s;pare people for this colony: The in|habitants however have now encrea&s;ed to about 60,000; the greate&s;t number of whom live near the &s;ea, along the coa&s;t.

<P>Marriages here, as in other countries, are often con|tracted for the &s;ake of intere&s;t, and as con&s;ent is re|quired in Iceland, with as much formality as in other nations, it is not unu&s;ual for a father, or the neare&s;t re|lation to refu&s;e con&s;ent, on very trifling accounts. When a young man has fixed his choice, the mini&s;ter cu&s;tomarily goes and a&s;ks the bride in marriage of her parents and guardians; which if complied with, not many ceremonies are afterwards u&s;ed; nor, as their hou&s;es are &s;mall, have they many gue&s;ts. The bride and bridegroom are attended to church by their neare&s;t relations, and there joined in wedlock by the mini&s;ter, generally on a &s;unday, before he goes into the pulpit. When &s;ervice is ended, they have an entertainment at the bride's hou&s;e, according to their circum&s;tances, but without mu&s;ic or dancing; and, when the fea&s;t is over, they all retire to their re&s;pective habitations.</P>
<P>They have indeed no idea of dancing; the mer|chants &s;ometimes at the factories will, for their diver|&s;ion, get a fiddle and &s;et them to dancing, but this is merely hopping and jumping about.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of their Trade.</HEAD>
<P>THE trade of this i&s;land has been &s;ubject to many revolutions, till the year 1400. The people of Norway, were almo&s;t the only per&s;ons who &s;ailed to Iceland and traded in fi&s;h. The Engli&s;h had this trade afterwards till the reformation, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n it fell into the hands of the Germans, and was very profitable to the Hamburghers. But Chri&s;tian IV. king of Denmark, who had the trade of his country much at heart, turned his attention likewi&s;e towards Iceland. He prohibited the Hans-towns from trading there in 1602, and be&s;tow|ed it on Copenhagen, and &s;ome other towns of Den|mark.</P>
<P>The Iceland Company at Copenhagen was not how|ever e&s;tabli&s;hed till 1620; it continued till 1662, and was then &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. The trade of every harbour was afterwards di&s;po&s;ed of to the be&s;t bidder, once in &s;ix years. However, in 1734, a new company was char|tered, for which they pay 6000 rix-dollars annually to the crown of Denmark. They &s;end near thirty &s;hips there every year, loaded with corn, bread, wine, brandy, &s;alt, tobacco, fi&s;hing-lines, coar&s;e-linen, timber, and
<PB N="139" REF="147">
what per&s;ons in good circum&s;tances have occa&s;ion for in their families; taking back in return fi&s;h, fle&s;h, but|ter, blubber, &s;kins, &s;alted lamb's-fle&s;h, tallow, wool, coar&s;e and fine baize, foxes-&s;kins, eider-down, feathers, <HI>wadmel</HI> jackets, &s;tockings and gloves.</P>
<P>It is difficult to determine, whether the Company profits much by this trade; it is certain, that the Ice|landers lo&s;e by it, for the Dutch &s;muggle in there much better goods than the Company, and &s;muggle out again a con&s;iderable quantity of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>There is a market kept annually at Hraundals-retter, to which tho&s;e who live up the country re&s;ort, and bar|ter their butter, cloth and &s;heep, for fi&s;h, blubber, and the like. And at Reikavik, there is a woollen manu|factory, where twenty or thirty workmen are employed.</P>
<P>The merchants are very &s;u&s;picious of the Icelanders, and never purcha&s;e any of their goods, without exa|mining them all &s;eparately. Dani&s;h money is current in the country, but there is very little of it. Their accounts are generally kept according to yards of <HI>wad|mel</HI> and fi&s;hes. <HI>Wadmel</HI> we have already mentioned; of fi&s;hes, each fi&s;h weighing two pounds, are valued at a rix-dollar in &s;pecie, that is, about 3<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> Engli&s;h.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of their Literature.</HEAD>
<P>IT would be forming a very wrong judgment of Ice|land, to conceive it ab&s;orbed in ignorance and ob&s;curity. I can affirm, &s;ays Von Troil, that I have found more knowledge among the lower cla&s;s of peo|ple there, than is to be met with in mo&s;t other places; there are few pea&s;ants, who, be&s;ides being well in|&s;tructed in the principles of religion, are not al&s;o ac|quainted with the hi&s;tory of their own country, which proceeds from their reading, by way of amu&s;ement, their traditional accounts; nor, is it uncommon to find per&s;ons among them, who can repeat the poems of Kolbein Grim&s;on, Sigurd Gi&s;le, and Gudmund Berg|thors, by heart, all of whom were poets in later times. The clergy &s;peak latin well and fluently, and I have found better libraries in many parts of Iceland, than could have been expected.</P>
<P>Among the Icelanders who have acquired mo&s;t fame in the literary world are, Dr. Finnur Jon&s;on, bi&s;hop of Skallholt, who, be&s;ides many learned writings on the antiquities of Iceland, has lately pre&s;ented the public with an eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, in three quarto volumes,
<PB N="141" REF="149">
replete with information, critici&s;m and erudition; he was made bi&s;hop of that dioce&s;e in 1754, and was alive in 1772. Halfdan Ejnar&s;on, rector of the &s;chool of Hoolum, is another Icelander, who has written <HI>Hi&s;|toria literaria, I&s;landiae;</HI> and there are many others. Arnas M&auml;gnaus, and Torfoeus, both natives of this i&s;land, have particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for literature, in this and the la&s;t century.</P>
<P>Four or five centuries ago, the Icelanders were cele|brated for their poetry and knowledge in hi&s;tory. I could name, &s;ays Von Troil, many of their poets, who celebrated the war-like deeds of the northern kings, in &s;ongs, and to the famous Snorre Sturle&s;on, author of the Edda, is even the Swedi&s;h nation indebted, for the fir&s;t illu&s;tration of their hi&s;tory. For this rea&s;on, &s;o high a value has been &s;et on the ancient Icelandic records and writings, that they have almo&s;t all been drawn out of the country; Sir Jo&s;eph Banks brought away in 1772, upwards of 160 manu&s;cripts, and has pre&s;ented them to the Briti&s;h mu&s;eum.</P>
<P>That there is a printing-office in Iceland, cannot be unknown, as we are acquainted with the &s;carce editions of Olof Tryggwa&s;&s;ons, Landnama, Greenland and Chri&s;tendom traditions, printed at Skallholt. They have had a printing-pre&s;s there &s;ince the year 1530, and are well acquainted with the old Runic characters.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="150">At a time, when no great knowledge of the latin language could be expected, even in Sweden, an Ice|lander was however met with of &s;ufficient capacity and learning, to in&s;truct youth to read and under&s;tand the latin poets; and, it may be affirmed by their ancient chronicles, that Iceland, from the introduction of the chri&s;tian religion there, till the year 1264, when it be|came &s;ubject to the crown of Norway, was one of the few countries in Europe, and the only one in the north, where the Sciences were cultivated and held in e&s;teem. And their ancient annals are the only remaining monu|ments of the old northern hi&s;tory, and are of &s;uch au|thority, that we cannot deny the &s;ame credit we &s;o im|plicitly give to the writings of Tacitus and Livy.</P>
<P>Such great pains are now taken to appoint men of known abilities, as teachers to the public &s;chools in Iceland; that few of the clergy &s;tudy any where el&s;e; though in the year 1773, there were fifty-four &s;tudents from Iceland, in the univer&s;ity of Copenhagen.</P>
<P>The language is the &s;ame as that formerly &s;poken in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, and has pre&s;erved it|&s;elf &s;o pure, that any Icelander under&s;tands the ancient traditional hi&s;tories of tho&s;e countries, better than the natives do them&s;elves. Near the coa&s;ts &s;ome Dani&s;h is &s;poken, nor is it uncommon for a pea&s;ant to make u&s;e of latin phra&s;es of &s;alutation. The following is
<PB N="143" REF="151">
the Lord's Prayer, according to the Iceland language in 1746.</P>
<Q>Fader vor thu &s;em ert a himnum, helge&s;&s;t thitt nafor, tilkomme thitt rike, verde thin vilie, &s;o a jordu &s;em a himne.

<P>There is an Icelandic Grammar, printed in 1651, and &s;everal Icelandic Dictionaries. The Edda, which has hitherto been con&s;idered as the mythology of the ancients, but now known to be an introduction to Icelandic poetry, is one of the mo&s;t celebrated remains of antiquity, and judged to have been written by Snorre Sturle&s;on, who was beheaded in Iceland in 1241. The following lines from this poem, will give the reader an idea of their poetry.</P>
<Q><L>Heigni eg hamri kringdan</L>
<L>Hang a riupu tangar</L>
<L>Grymnis &s;ylgs a galga</L>
<L>Gynnung bruar linna.</L></Q>
<P>The natural di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e words is; <HI>Eg heingi hamri kringdan linna gynnung a hang riupu bruar tangar
<PB N="144" REF="152">
a Grymnis, &s;ylgs galga;</HI> in Engli&s;h this,
<Q>I hang the round beaten gaping &s;nake on the end of the bridge of the mountain bird, at the gallows of Odin's &s;hield.</Q>
By "Gallows of Odin's &s;hield," is meant the arm, on which the &s;hield is worn. By the <HI>ripa</HI> is under&s;tood a falcon, (one genus being put for another.) The bridge of the falcon is the hand, on which the falconer places him; and, it's end or tong, (tongue) the finger. "The gaping round beaten &s;nake," means a ring, and con&s;equently this long &s;tory means no more than, "I put a ring on my finger."</P>
<P>From the above it may ea&s;ily be imagined, that there is no language that allows a poet &s;o much liberty as the Icelandic, nor any &s;o rich in poetical expre&s;&s;ions; but, the difficulty of under&s;tanding it, has been the cau&s;e of the contempt it lies under.</P>
<P>Before we quit this &s;ubject, we will take occa&s;ion to &s;ay &s;omething of the few monuments of antiquity re|maining on this i&s;land. The only pieces of antiquity here to be found, (for their are no ancient manu&s;cripts, Icelandic annals or hi&s;torical traditions, now to be met with,) are &s;ome ruins of an old ca&s;tle near Videdal; &s;ome of a le&s;&s;er one at Laugernas, and &s;ome remains of heathen temples and burying-places in different parts, with an ancient place of execution at Hegranas. There are no other monuments remaining of Sturle&s;on, than his writings, except a mount overgrown with gra&s;s, at

Reikholt, &s;aid to have been rai&s;ed from the ruins of his hou&s;e; the burying place of his family, and at a little di&s;tance from them, one of the fine&s;t baths in the whole i&s;land.

In Sturle&s;on's time, a long covered pa&s;&s;age led from thence to the dwelling hou&s;e. The &s;pring is at forty paces di&s;tance, which &s;upplies the bath, and the water is conveyed through a conduit, at the end of which, is a hole, &s;hut with a &s;pigot and fawcet, that lets in as much hot water as you plea&s;e, which can be ea&s;ily cooled, by water from an adjoining brook.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of their Religion, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Roman catholic religion took place throughout Europe, it was likewi&s;e the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of this i&s;land, and was not extirpated without &s;ome effu&s;ion of blood. Since the reformation, the Lutheran religion is the only one
<PB N="146" REF="154">
tolerated here, though the people are not without their &s;uper&s;titions.</P>
<P>The Icelanders fir&s;t received their own bi&s;hops, in the year 1057, at Skallholt, and in 1107, at Hoolum, They were originally under the juri&s;diction of the arch|bi&s;hop of Bremen and Hamburgh, but in the year, 1103 or 4, became &s;ubordinate to Azeus, fir&s;t archbi&s;hop of Lund in Scania, and in 1152, to the bi&s;hop of Dron|theim. The Lutheran religion was introduced and there e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1551.</P>
<P>Iceland is divided into 189 pari&s;hes, of which, 127 belong to the &s;ee of Skallholt, which extends over the ea&s;t, &s;outh and we&s;t quarters, and 62 to that of Hoo|lum, which extends over the north quarter. Each bi|&s;hoprick has a latin &s;chool, with a rector and other a&s;|&s;i&s;tants under him, who teach theology, and other bran|ches of literature, and fit out tho&s;e de&s;igned for the mi|ni&s;try. Some, however, &s;tudy at Copenhagen, and generally get the be&s;t livings, and more lucrative civil employments, but all the mini&s;ters are Icelanders or natives. In the time of the reformation, a great part of the church revenues were &s;ecularized, and now be|long to the king. The income of each bi&s;hoprick may amount to 2000 rix-dollars, out of which the bi|&s;hop mu&s;t keep the rector and corrector, the mini&s;ter of the cathedral church, who is the bi&s;hop's curate, and a certain number of &s;cholars, who have lodging, board,

Some livings are tolerably good, &s;ome middling, and &s;ome very poor; the be&s;t do no exceed 200 rix-dollars a year. The revenues of many of the poor livings are &s;o &s;mall, that their mi|ni&s;ters are, for &s;upport, obliged to have recour&s;e to manual labour, or go a fi&s;hing like the common peo|ple; and, yet their congregations are not neglected, they follow the example of the Apo&s;tle Paul, who though he earned his bread by the labour of his hands, was a great and edifying preacher.</P>
<P>The conduct of the clergy is very narrowly in&s;pected into, as well as that of the people in general, in regard to religious matters, and the lea&s;t fault is not &s;uffered to go unpuni&s;hed. If a mini&s;ter, on a &s;unday, &s;ets out only on a &s;hort journey, he is cited to appear before a court, and the matter is there enquired into. For the crime of drunkenne&s;s, or any other indecency, they lo&s;e their preferment, and are deprived from the mini&s;try. Their attention in religious concerns ope|rate powerfully on the people. An Icelander never pa&s;&s;es a river, or any other dangerous place, without previou&s;ly taking off his hat and imploring the Divine protection, and he is always thankful to God when he has pa&s;&s;ed the danger.</P>

<HEAD>A De&s;cription of LAPLAND.</HEAD>
<P>From the Latin of Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Scheffer,</HI> (who was em|ployed by the Chancellor of Sweden to travel into that Country, and give the King a particular Ac|count of it,) <HI>Olaus Magnus,</HI> an Archbi&s;hop of Swe|den, and Others.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Country in general, and it's Productions.</HEAD>
<P>LAPLAND is divided into three parts, one of which belongs to the crown of Denmark, one to that of Sweden, and one to the empire of Ru&s;&s;ia; that belonging to the Swedes, is by far the mo&s;t valu|able, and comprehends all the country, from the gulph of Bothnia, to the mountains that &s;eparate Norway
<PB N="153" REF="161">
from Sweden. Swedi&s;h Lapland then is the object of authors in de&s;cribing this country, which is about 100 German miles in length, and 90 in breadth, and lies between 64 and 71 degrees of north latitude; further north than Iceland, or any part of Greenland we have treated of. In depicting Swedi&s;h Lapland, we de&s;cribe the other two, though we &s;hall &s;peak occa&s;ionally of tho&s;e belonging to Denmark and to Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The Laplanders are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been de&s;cended from Finlanders, driven out of their own country, and were called <HI>Lappes,</HI> which &s;ignifies exiles. To have an idea of the country, the reader mu&s;t conceive, a va&s;t ma&s;s of mountains crowded together, and ri&s;ing by de|grees to &s;uch a prodigious height, as to be always co|vered with &s;now, even in the &s;ummer-time. In the winter-time, the mo&s;t rapid rivers are covered with ice, four or five feet thick; nay, the large&s;t lakes and the &s;ea it&s;elf is frozen, &s;ufficient to bear any weight; but, what is mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing, and &s;eems not very pro|bable is, that the heat of the &s;ummer is as inten&s;e, as is the cold in the winter; the only relief they have, are the vapours that ri&s;e from the neighbouring &s;eas, and from the &s;now which remains both &s;ummer and winter, in the rece&s;&s;es of the rocks and hollows between mountains, which all that &s;ea&s;on are extremely &s;ubject to lightning and thunders. Spring and autumn are &s;ea&s;ons unknown among the Laplanders, there being but an interval of a very few days, between the cold of winter and the heat of &s;ummer, it appearing almo&s;t a
<PB N="154" REF="162">
miracle to &s;uch as are unacquainted with the&s;e parts, to &s;ee the fields cloathed with green herbs and gra&s;s, which a week before were enveloped in &s;now. Nature &s;eems &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the &s;hortne&s;s of the &s;ummer here, that &s;he brings things to perfection, with a &s;peed incredible, but to tho&s;e, who have &s;een it. The &s;oil is neither fer|tile nor barren, but between both, though it is full of flints and &s;mall rocks, and of cour&s;e very rough and uneven. Indeed there is but little ground fit for til|lage; for be&s;ides the rivers and lakes, of which there are a great many; du&s;ky fore&s;ts and unhealthy mo|ra&s;&s;es cover great part of the flat country. In the more &s;outhern parts of Lapland, the ground is much better calculated for herbage, than the northern parts. In the neighbourhood of Bothnia, they have a variety of vegetables in their gardens, &s;uch as cole-worts, tur|nips, par&s;neps, radi&s;hes, &amp;c. but further north, little of this is to be &s;een; for be&s;ides the rocky hills and mountains, there are va&s;t tracts of barren &s;and, which are rai&s;ed frequently by high winds, and cover the ad|jacent country, like &s;now. The&s;e &s;ands are &s;ometimes &s;o dangerous to travellers, from their depth, that men and bea&s;ts have mi&s;&s;ed their way and been buried in them. On the &s;ide of Norway, the &s;ands are &s;ome|times mountain-high. Nature has divided this part of the Swedi&s;h territories from Norway, by a va&s;t ridge of mountains, a hundred leagues in length, as by a wall; and, the tops of the&s;e mountains, are frequently
<PB N="155" REF="163">
&s;o high, that they appear like clouds above the ho|rizon.</P>
<P>The principal rivers that wa&s;h this country, ri&s;e out of the mountains of Norway, and di&s;charge them&s;elves into the bay of Bothnia, and as the&s;e rivers are often &s;welled, by the melting of the &s;now and ice, they are full of cataracts and water-falls, which fall with great noi&s;e from the rocks, and in many places are &s;carce navigable; there is one called <HI>Niome&s;a&s;ki,</HI> or the hare's leap, where the river <HI>Luhlao</HI> forces it's way, through &s;o narrow a pa&s;&s;age between two rocks, that a hare may leap from one to the other. The&s;e cataracts are a great hindrance to &s;hips, but they afford a va&s;t num|ber of fi&s;hes, and are very beneficial to the melting-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the lakes, many of them are &s;o large, as never to have been traced: &s;ome are 400 miles long, and 100 broad, and abound with i&s;lands. They yield &s;uch an incredible quantity of fi&s;hes, that the natives chiefly live on them; and, the Laplanders hold them &s;o &s;acred, that they will not allow the lea&s;t dirt to be thrown into them.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of this country is &s;o near the pole, that in &s;ome parts, during the &s;ummer months, the &s;un never &s;ets; and, for three months together, during the winter months, it never ri&s;es for the &s;ame &s;pace of time;
<PB N="156" REF="164">
but, this part of the country is inhabited by &s;avage Laplanders. Though in the &s;ummer the &s;un does not &s;et, yet it &s;kirts the horizon only, and it's rays only &s;lide along the ground; &s;o in the winter, it is not much below the horizon, of cour&s;e there is a con&s;tant twi|light, &s;ufficient for people to pur&s;ue their work. Be|&s;ides, the further the &s;un is removed from mankind, the more they enjoy the benefit of the moon, for ri&s;ing higher than it does with us, it affords a more con&s;ider|able light; &s;o, that what other nations perform in the day-time, is by Laplanders done by moon-light. Nay, when the moon does not &s;hine, the glittering of the &s;tars in a pure and &s;erene air, give more light than with us, and this, augmented by the glare of the &s;now, enables them to &s;ee &s;ufficiently to do almo&s;t any bu&s;i|ne&s;s they have to tran&s;act abroad.</P>
<P>The air of Lapland is generally very pure and clear, and con&s;equently not unwhole&s;ome; but the weather is very changeable, owing to the winds, and &s;uddenly &s;o. The winds rage here with great violence, and one par|ticular wind from the &s;ea, brings with it, &s;uch thick fogs, that the people are not able to &s;ee one another. In the winter-time, this wind drives &s;uch a prodigious quantity of &s;now to the continent, that if any one is caught in it, he has no other remedy, than to lay flat on the ground, and cover him&s;elf as well as he can, till it is over, and then make the be&s;t &s;hift he can to get from under it, and &s;eek &s;helter in the next cottage.
<PB N="157" REF="165">
Among the mountains which &s;eparate Swedi&s;h Lapland from Norway, the winds rage, &s;ays Olaus Petri, with &s;uch fury, as &s;ometimes to carry men and bea&s;ts from the tops, a great way down the precipices, &s;o that they are never &s;een or heard of more; the only remedy peo|ple have in &s;uch tempe&s;tuous times, is, to run for &s;hel|ter to a den or a cave. On the&s;e mountains, no trees will grow; and, it is ea&s;y to be imagined, that the cold in this country mu&s;t be exce&s;&s;ive, intolerable to any one but tho&s;e who are natives of the place. In winter, it is no unu&s;ual thing for their lips to be fro|zen to the cup in attempting to drink, and the limbs of the inhabitants often mortify with the cold.</P>
<P>Among the productions of this country are pine|trees, fir, juniper, birch, the &s;ervice-tree and willow, the a&s;p, the alder and the dog-tree. Lapland produces no oak, beech or ha&s;el, nor any fruit-trees, &s;uch as our apple, pear, or cherry-trees; they have currants and a variety of palatable berries, &s;ome peculiar to the cli|mate; and, many u&s;eful herbs. Va&s;t quantities of an|gelica grow every where wild, on &s;hort but thick &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lks, and they have &s;ome herbs, met with in no other coun|try than this, &s;everal different mo&s;&s;es, and a gra&s;s, which is &s;o &s;oft and warm, that the Laplanders put it into their &s;hoes and gloves, to defend them again&s;t the rigor of the cold.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="166">Silver mines have been di&s;covered and worked in Lapland, and there are al&s;o mines of copper and lead, and plenty of iron-ore. Beautiful cry&s;tals are al&s;o met with, and &s;ome amethy&s;ts and topazes, and a va|riety of minerals poli&s;hed by nature. Pearls are like|wi&s;e met with in &s;ome of the Lapland rivers, but not in the &s;eas, and they are found not in oy&s;ters, but in &s;hell|fi&s;h like mu&s;cles; they have not that lively brightne&s;s that makes the oriental pearls &s;o valuable, though now and then one is found of equal &s;ize and beauty. I &s;aw once, &s;ays Scheffer, a pearl of Lapland, &s;o bright and &s;o exactly round, that 120 crowns was offered for it, and the jeweller prote&s;ted, that if he knew how to match it, he would not &s;ell them both for 500 crowns. Whil&s;t the&s;e pearls are growing they &s;tick fa&s;t within the &s;hell, but, when come to maturity loo&s;en, and when the mu&s;cles open, drop out.</P>

<P>AMONG the wild-bea&s;ts of Lapland, the bear is e&s;teemed the king of the woods, exceeding the re&s;t in &s;trength and fiercene&s;s. They are very nu|merous here, and do con&s;iderable mi&s;chief to the cat|tle,
<PB N="159" REF="167">
and tho&s;e &s;tore-hou&s;es which the Laplanders erect on the bodies of trees, for the bears will pull them down and de&s;troy the provi&s;ions there hoarded. The elk or elges, is the next animal of importance, it is &s;omething of the rein-deer kind, but as large as a hor&s;e. A French gentleman, employed by the Dani&s;h. merchants, who traded to the north in the beginning of this century, relates, that he was once out an elk|hunting, in Norway; that they no &s;ooner &s;aw an elk than, (before they fired at it,) it dropped: and, that a&s;king how it came to fall down dead in that manner, was told, it was the nature of the animal to be thus taken with a kind of falling &s;ickne&s;s, which often &s;eized them in the beginning of a cha&s;e, and that from this di&s;ea&s;e, they are called <HI>Elks,</HI> or mi&s;erable creatures. When clo&s;e attacked, the elk will &s;tand boldly in his own defence, and will frequently de&s;troy two or three dogs by his heels. There are al&s;o in Lapland, wild rein-deer, wolves, gluttons, beavers, otters, foxes, mar|tins, ermines, &s;quirrels and hares. The wolves here are white, and great enemies to the tame rein-deer; but, what is remarkable, a wolf will never attack a rein-deer, if it be tied to a &s;take; but, if at liberty, he often becomes their prey. Po&s;&s;ibly the wolf is afraid of a &s;nare, and therefore avoids the rein deer when he &s;ees the rope by which he is tied, for this creature is very timorous, and alarmed at the &s;ight of a rope, which he con&s;iders as a &s;nare to catch him. Be&s;ides as the Laplanders generally tie their rein-deer to
<PB N="160" REF="168">
&s;takes when they milk them, wolves, when they &s;ee one tied, conceive a man is near at hand to kill them. But &s;ome wolves are &s;o fierce, that they will &s;ometimes fly upon a man or woman, (e&s;pecially if &s;he is with child,) &s;o that travellers, &s;ays Olaus Magnus, are obliged to go armed, and women are never &s;uffered to travel without an armed attendant, the wolves being eager after them if with child, and they know by the &s;cent, if they are &s;o.</P>
<P>Gluttons are likewi&s;e very numerous here. The head of this animal is rounder than, and their tails long and &s;harp like, the wolf's, and it's body larger, but feet &s;horter, than the otter's. It's &s;kin is very black and very bright, and looks like black-flowered da|ma&s;k; it is valued almo&s;t as much as a &s;able-&s;kin, though the hair is not &s;o &s;oft, nor &s;o fine. It is an am|phibious animal, dwelling partly in the water like an otter; indeed, &s;ome have taken it for a &s;pecies of the otter, but it re&s;embles mo&s;t our turn&s;pit-dogs. It is a gluttonous animal, nothing coming ami&s;s to it, but it lives chiefly on water-fowl. It is &s;o ravenous, that it is &s;aid to devour a carca&s;e larger than it&s;elf, and un|burthens it's &s;tomach, by &s;queezing it&s;elf between two clo&s;e &s;tanding trees.</P>
<P>Of foxes, there is a great variety in Lapland, black, brown, a&s;h-colour and white; the black ones are the fine&s;t and rare&s;t, and their &s;kins are worn on the caps
<PB N="161" REF="169">
of per&s;ons of the be&s;t rank in Mu&s;covy. They will fetch 10, or 15 ducats a piece. Some of the brown foxes are marked with a black-cro&s;s on their backs, as our a&s;&s;es are.</P>
<P>Martins, al&s;o, are no le&s;s numerous than the foxes, and no country affords finer &s;kins than this. The food of the martin is birds and &s;quirrels. By the help of it's claws, it will climb the trees in the night and catch the &s;quirrels, who have no chance of e&s;caping, but, by running up upon the &s;maller boughs to the top of the trees, where the martin by it's weight cannot follow them, and by leaping from one tree to another. The birds they catch whil&s;t at roo&s;t.</P>
<P>The number of &s;quirrels throughout Lapland, is incredible; and, they have this peculiar property, of changing their colour twice a year. In &s;ummer, they are red; in winter, grey. But notwith&s;tanding their numbers, they &s;ometimes leave the country in &s;uch troops, that few are left behind. Samuel Rheen and Olaus Petri, who have both been eye-witne&s;&s;es of the fact, a&s;&s;ert, that when they are about to leave the coun|try, they retire in whole troops to the lakes, and there putting them&s;elves upon &s;mall pieces of bark or cork, &s;et their tails upright, as if they were under &s;ail, and are carried as the wind directs them; though &s;ometimes they will paddle on with their feet. If the weather &s;hould prove tempe&s;tuous, perhaps both the &s;hips and
<PB N="162" REF="170">
&s;hip's crew, &s;hall fall a &s;acrifice to the waves; but, &s;hould this be the ca&s;e, the country is &s;oon re-&s;tocked, by the few that remain, for a female &s;quirrel brings five or &s;ix at a litter.</P>
<P>The ermine is nothing but a white wea&s;el, with the tip of it's tail black; it al&s;o catches mice as wea&s;els do. The mice are mountain-mice, and differ from ours by having &s;hort tails and &s;tanding hair of a red and black colour mixed. They are called in Norway, <HI>Lemming.</HI> Rheen &s;ays, they appear &s;uddenly in rainy and &s;tormy weather, and cover the ground by their va&s;t multitudes, &s;o that Olaus and Wormius have im|agined they fell from the clouds; but the fact is, that they either delight in rainy weather, or perhaps are driven by violent rains and &s;torms from their caves. They are not fearful but bold, and do not run away at the approach of a pa&s;&s;enger, but will, if &s;truck, turn about and bite the &s;tick like an enraged dog. They never enter any hou&s;es or huts, or do any mi&s;|chief there, but keep among the &s;hrubs and brambles. They will &s;ometimes divide them&s;elves into two par|ties, and attack each other like warriors, and when the Laplanders, who are a &s;u&s;picious people, &s;ee this, they conceive it pre&s;ages future wars in Sweden. The&s;e mice are not only food for the ermine and fox, but al&s;o for the rein-deer: and what is &s;ingular, their life is &s;o &s;hort, that they live no longer than after an herb,
<PB N="163" REF="171">
which they have eat of, grows again, of cour&s;e they die in heaps.</P>
<P>Hares here become white in winter, as many other of the Lapland animals do, a care of Providence to pre&s;erve them from the hunter, they being then not di&s;tingui&s;hable from the &s;now.</P>
<P>I come now to the tame dome&s;tic animals of this country. Lapland affords no hor&s;es, a&s;&s;es, oxen, &s;heep or goats. Indeed, hor&s;es would be u&s;ele&s;s, of cour&s;e, they &s;et no value on them; but, the natives &s;ometimes purcha&s;e oxen, &s;heep and goats, in Norway, for their fle&s;h, their wool, and their &s;kins. They keep them however only one &s;ummer, and then kill them. The only tame animal, proper to Lapland, and which is no where el&s;e to be found, except in the mo&s;t northern parts, is the rein-deer, and perhaps the mo&s;t u&s;eful of any in the creation. It re&s;embles the &s;tag, only is larger, and droops it's head, and it's horns project for|wards. The Laplanders call it <HI>Herki</HI> or <HI>Puatze.</HI> When the rein-deer walks, the joints of it's feet make a noi&s;e like the cla&s;hing of flints, or cracking of nuts. In &s;ummer it feeds upon gra&s;s and leaves, and in the winter upon mo&s;s, which it has a wonderful &s;agacity in di&s;covering, and when found, it &s;crapes away the &s;now that covers it, with it's feet. Such as are de&s;igned for u&s;e, the Laplanders geld at a year old, by biting the nerves near their genitals. The females, like our

ewes, furni&s;h them with milk, chee&s;e and young ones, and it is ob&s;ervable, that &s;uch as have young ones, (though the fawns &s;uck them before they are milked,) will give more milk than tho&s;e who have no young ones to &s;uckle. Their milk is as rich as cream, and very nouri&s;hing. Though thin milk makes good chee&s;e, it will not make butter. As the&s;e animals are of great u&s;e, they are careful to pre&s;erve them from wild bea&s;ts, or &s;traying into danger; for which purpo&s;e, the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, as al&s;o the children and &s;er|vants, are commonly near at hand whil&s;t they are feed|ing. It is a hard &s;ervice for &s;ervants in the winter-time, to watch them, whil&s;t they feed among the mountains. This and their &s;mall wages, is the rea&s;on why they do not continue above &s;ix months in one place, their yearly wages being no more than a rein-deer of two years old. Scanty as their provi&s;ion is in winter, the rein-deer thrives be&s;t at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, for in &s;ummer, they are nothing but &s;kin and bones. They &s;wim with their bodies half above the water, with &s;uch incredible force and &s;wiftne&s;s acro&s;s the large&s;t rivers, that a boat with oars &s;hall &s;carce be able to keep up with them. This animal &s;eldom lives beyond the thirteenth year, and what is mo&s;t &s;urpriz|ing, &s;ays Lundius, is, that when a Laplander dies, the whole, or at lea&s;t the greate&s;t part, of his rein-deer, die at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="173">The chief part of a Laplander's riches con&s;i&s;ts in the number of rein-deer he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, for be&s;ides the food it furni&s;hes, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther fre&s;h or dried, they are u&s;ed as hor&s;es in travelling, their &s;kin forms excellent cloath|ing both for the bed and body; their milk and chee&s;e, are plea&s;ant and nutritive, and their inte&s;tines and ten|dons are converted into thread and cordage. But with the&s;e excellent qualities, they are not without their in|conveniences; for, be&s;ides the difficulty of keeping them from &s;traggling, they frequently grow re&s;tive, to the great danger of the driver and his carriage. Their &s;urprizing &s;peed, (for they are &s;aid to run at the rate of 200 miles a day,) &s;eems to be owing to their impa|tience to get rid of their incumbrance. None but a Laplander could bear the unea&s;y po&s;ture in which he is confined in the &s;ledge they travel in; or believe, that by whi&s;pering the rein-deer in the ear, they make him acquainted with the place they are travelling to, and the length of the journey he has to go.</P>
<P>The rein-deer thus &s;upply the place of hor&s;es, &s;heep and cows, to which other nations are accu&s;tomed; it is the animal to which the Laplanders apply all their care, except their dogs, which they train up to hunting, and guarding their huts and cattle, and which they &s;ell commonly to one another, for one, two, or three crowns a piece.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="174">Of the winged tribe, Lapland abounds in &s;wans, ducks, gee&s;e, lapwings, &s;nipes, and all &s;orts of water-fowl, be&s;ides heath-cocks, &s;tock-doves, wood-cocks, and partridges; and of poultry, they have cocks, hens, and turkeys, of all kinds. The lapwing here, &s;eems to be a bird of pa&s;&s;age, as they come to this country every &s;pring to breed. Olaus Petri &s;ays, they come in &s;uch va&s;t flights as to darken the &s;ky, and wherever they &s;ettle at nights, or come to look for food, they make &s;uch a noi&s;e, that you may hear them at half a league's di&s;tance.</P>
<P>There is a kind of &s;nipe peculiar to this country, called by the natives <HI>Kniper,</HI> black on the head, back and wings, the bread and belly white, with a long red bill, &s;et with teeth, with &s;hort, red, webbed feet, like tho&s;e of a duck.</P>
<P>Their partridges are white here in winter, and grey in &s;ummer, and differ from our partridges in this, that they have feet like hares, covered with wool in&s;tead of feathers, from whence they are called <HI>Lagepedes.</HI> Be|&s;ides the&s;e u&s;eful birds, in the mountains they have eagles which will &s;ometimes kill the young rein-deer.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to fi&s;h, they have incredible quantities of all kinds. Scarce any part of Europe abounds &s;o much with &s;almon, as the Bothnian &s;ea. From their mountains de&s;cend va&s;t rivers of fre&s;h water, in which

This country produces few weazels, and no &s;nakes; neither are in&s;ects very frequent here. Fleas they know not, but are full of lice, becau&s;e the Laplander's wear no linen, and change their cloaths very &s;eldom. They lou&s;e them&s;elves in the &s;ummer, and in the winter expo&s;e their cloaths to the cold air, which kills them. In the mar&s;hy grounds of the north, they are pe&s;tered with great gnats, which make an odi|ous noi&s;e when they &s;ting. The rein-deer run from them to the tops of the mountains, and the natives de|fend them&s;elves again&s;t them, by keeping in their huts a continual &s;moke; when a&s;leep, they cover their heads and bodies with a blanket, and when abroad, they cover them&s;elves with &s;kins, and a cloth-cap, which they can pull occa&s;ionally over their faces; but, &s;ome be&s;mear their faces with ro&s;in or pitch, by way of a further defence.</P>

<P>THE Laplanders in general are very low of &s;tature, &s;eldom more than four feet and an half in height; which has given occa&s;ion to the anci|ents to place their pigmies in the&s;e northern countries. The women are rather hand&s;ome, their complexion being a mixture of white and red; but the men are &s;warthy, and probably the lowne&s;s of their huts and tents, and their con&s;tantly &s;itting in the &s;moke, may contribute not a little to the dingine&s;s of their hue. They are not only &s;hort of &s;tature, but extremely thin, a fat man being &s;eldom &s;een among them; for the cold|ne&s;s of the climate not only prevents their growth, but dries up the moi&s;ture of their bodies. They have very thick, large heads, prominent foreheads, &s;hort and flat no&s;es, wide mouths, and like hogs, are hollow and blear eyed. Their hair is &s;hort, &s;traight, hard, and thin, and univer&s;ally black in both &s;exes. The beards of the men &s;carce cover their chins. Their brea&s;ts are broad, their wai&s;ts rather &s;lender, and though the men in general are &s;pindle-&s;hanked, they are extremely active and &s;wift of foot. They will &s;wim over their lakes and rivers with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, and are &s;o expert at
<PB N="169" REF="177">
diving, as to continue under water a con&s;iderable time, and when they ri&s;e, will, with a &s;pring, throw them&s;elves frequently out of it. Lundius, who was a native of Lapland, gives us an in&s;tance of the agility and expert|ne&s;s of a fellow, that lived in his time; who, having quitted his habitation, to change it for a better, came with his whole family to the banks of the <HI>Stoortutaad,</HI> which being frozen over, he endeavoured to pa&s;s upon the ice; but, &s;carce had they reached the middle of it than the ice broke under them, and his wife and an|other woman were carried away by the rapidity of the current; which the Laplander no &s;ooner &s;aw, than he plunged into the water, &s;wam after them a great way under the ice, and brought them &s;afe a&s;hore, to the &s;ur|pri&s;e of his countrymen, who, agreeable to their ge|neral infatuation, were per&s;waded he had formed him|&s;elf into a fi&s;h. Rivalling each other in climbing inacce&s;&s;ible rocks and the highe&s;t trees, like monkeys, are their daily exerci&s;es. But, vigorous and nimble as they are, they &s;eldom, if ever, walk upright, but &s;toop continually, attributed to their &s;itting on the ground in their low cottages.</P>
<P>Dwelling chiefly in the fore&s;ts, among wild bea&s;ts, each family at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from another, and enjoying no conver&s;ation but what ari&s;es within their own hovels, what wonder is it that they &s;hould be addicted to &s;uper&s;tition, but of this I &s;hall treat at large hereafter. In di&s;po&s;ition, they are timid and da&s;tardly
<PB N="170" REF="178">
beyond expre&s;&s;ion, flying at the very &s;ight of a &s;tran|ger, or at the approach of a &s;hip to the &s;hore, from a conception, that they come to rob them, or carry them into &s;lavery. From this inherent timidity in the Lap|landers, the Swedes never draw any of their &s;oldiers from among them, whereas, every other part of that kingdom furni&s;hes a certain number: and yet timid as they are, they will live and pa&s;s whole nights alone, in the mo&s;t dreadful fore&s;ts, without any appearance of fear, and are not in the lea&s;t terrified at tho&s;e vi&s;ions or &s;pectres, which they idly conceive appear to them on the tops of the highe&s;t mountains. Nay, &s;o ill adapted are they to a military line, that from the greate&s;t natural attachment to their native country, they could not live long out of it, but would &s;oon lan|gui&s;h and die; be&s;ides, it has been found by experi|ence, that not only a more &s;outhern climate, but the diet of the Swedes, particularly &s;alt and bread, are as incompatible with the con&s;titution of a Laplander, as their dried fi&s;h and raw fle&s;h, the cu&s;tomary food of tho&s;e northern regions, would be with a Swede.</P>
<P>From a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own weakne&s;s, and a fearful di&s;po&s;ition, it mu&s;t naturally occur, that they are mi&s;tru&s;tful, and the con&s;equence of this temper is, a pronene&s;s to do all &s;orts of mi&s;chief clande&s;tinely, rather than not avoid the danger they apprehend from others. Hence it is, that as they deal much in ma|gick, they endeavour to hurt one another, upon the
<PB N="171" REF="179">
&s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ions. A little matter enrages them, and when they are enraged, they are as ungovernable and blood-thir&s;ty as wild bea&s;ts. This is mo&s;t ob&s;ervable in their old women, who, if put into a pa&s;&s;ion, (which they &s;oon are) will rave like a mad-man. Should any one, &s;ays Tornaeus, &s;peak har&s;hly to them, point at them, or ridicule them with words or ge&s;tures; or &s;hould a per&s;on chance to touch them unawares or a &s;park of fire fall on their hands, they will be &s;eized with &s;uch a furious madne&s;s, as to fall foul on him who was the cau&s;e of it, will tear his face and hands and &s;trike him with any thing in their reach; nay, &s;o little re&s;pect have they on the&s;e occa&s;ions to them&s;elves and others, that they will expo&s;e what nature teaches them to keep concealed; &s;o that during this paroxi&s;m of fury, they are like a per&s;on raving. In the &s;ame manner do the men act when drunk.</P>
<P>Among other vices, the Laplanders are very indu&s;|trious in cheating one another, a vice natural to mean &s;pirits, endeavouring to be before-hand with others, in what they fear from them; and when they are &s;ucce&s;sful in any under-hand trick, they never fail to laugh at tho&s;e they have outwitted. They are al&s;o great tatlers, &s;o that two or three &s;eldom meet, but their conver&s;ation is filled with &s;lander and detraction. They are very apt to cen&s;ure and find fault with other nations, conceiving them&s;elves to have qualifications &s;uperior to every other country; &s;o that there is &s;carce a Swede comes among
<PB N="172" REF="180">
them but they give him &s;ome nick-name. They are al&s;o avaritious, and what is almo&s;t a paradox, at the &s;ame time, lazy. Though there are many &s;pacious places in Lapland, &s;ufficiently fertile, they will leave them uncultivated, from more idlene&s;s. Thus they pa&s;s their lives, chu&s;ing to overcome the want of con|venient &s;u&s;tenance by patience, rather than by labour. Neither do they like to be&s;tow much pains in dre&s;&s;ing their food, nor do they ever go a hunting, or fi&s;hing, unle&s;s nece&s;&s;ity compels them. No &s;ooner have they dined, but they lay down to &s;leep. This indolence of di&s;po&s;ition, may probably give ri&s;e to another bad qua|lity they po&s;&s;e&s;s, that is, of neglecting and ill-treating their parents when old and &s;ick. They are al&s;o, &s;ays Wexovius, (in his de&s;cription of Sweden, a man who lived among them,) addicted to la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, though they abominate and puni&s;h adultery. Men and women without the lea&s;t di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex, live and lie promi&s;cuou&s;ly in the &s;ame hut. Clande&s;tine cohabita|tions, &s;ays Lundius, are very frequent among them, e&s;|pecially among the men and maid-&s;ervants, without the lea&s;t danger of ba&s;tardy, they being naturally of a barren con&s;titution. Indeed the whole country of Lap|land is not computed to contain more than 60,000 inhabitants. The Dani&s;h Laplanders, &s;ays the French traveller I have mentioned, are &s;tupid, brutal and la&s;|civious, e&s;pecially the women, who will pro&s;titute them&s;elves to all comers, if they can do it unknown to their hu&s;bands. The Swedi&s;h Laplanders have two
<PB N="173" REF="181">
other bad qualites, that of drunkenne&s;s, and &s;wearing: in times of the fir&s;t, they are &s;ure to quarrel and often cut one anothers faces with knives; and in their oaths, they make u&s;e of the mo&s;t dreadful imprecations. He who &s;wears, will frequently &s;trip him&s;elf naked to his wai&s;t, and thus &s;olemnly devote him&s;elf, his wife, chil|dren and rein-deer, to the devil. They take it for granted, that if the &s;wearer is innocent, no harm will be the con&s;equence of this oath; but if otherwi&s;e, &s;ome great misfortune will attend him. If the whole family be innocent, they will all e&s;cape without harm. Their melancholic habit renders them very &s;ubject to fright|ful dreams and apparitions, which they con&s;ider as in|fallible pre&s;ages by their genius, of what is to be&s;al them. Thus they are frequently &s;een lying upon the ground a&s;leep, and &s;ome &s;inging loudly, others howl|ing and making a hideous noi&s;e, like wolves.</P>
<P>After exhibiting their ill-qualities, it is but ju&s;tice I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething of their good ones. They are in the fir&s;t place &s;trict ob&s;ervers of conjugal fidelity. Thefts are never known among them, every one en|joying his own in quiet, without the lea&s;t danger of being robbed: though they will over-reachone another in their dealings, they abhor the very thought of &s;tealing. Foreign merchants trading in tho&s;e parts may, and often do, leave their property in the open air, covered only from the &s;now and bad weather, and travel to a great di&s;tance to buy up more commodities,
<PB N="174" REF="182">
without the lea&s;t danger of lo&s;ing it. And indeed, in a country without villages, inclo&s;ures or fixed habi|tations, without &s;uch an hone&s;t di&s;po&s;ition in the peo|ple, they could not trade there at all. The Lapland|ers al&s;o are very charitable to the poor, a character almo&s;t incompatible with avarice, but they are &s;o; and, will frequently provide them lodgings and &s;u&s;|tenance for months together. They are very ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t the poor with their own rein-deer, either by giv|ing them one, or lending them more than one, nay two, three, ten or twenty, for a whole &s;ummer. They are al&s;o very obliging and ho&s;pitable to &s;trangers, receiv|ing them with great kindne&s;s, and being ready to do them all the good offices in their power.</P>
<P>On the whole, however, this nation compared with other northern countries, is barbarous and unpoli&s;hed, but they are naturally a cleanly people, wa&s;hing their hands and faces many times a day. Neither do they want ingenuity, making all their tools and hou&s;hold furniture them&s;elves. They make al&s;o their own clothes and &s;hoes, and all their in&s;truments of hunting, fowling and fi&s;hing, and many things they make for foreign trade. They have a genius likewi&s;e for &s;ing|ing, and have generally a clear and harmonious voice.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of their Hou&s;es and Habits.</HEAD>
<P>IN former ages the Laplanders did not inhabit any hou&s;es, but dwelt about in tents and huts, erected in places, where conveniency of pa&s;turage or fi&s;hing led them; but, this cu&s;tom of wandering from place to place was aboli&s;hed by an edict of Charles IX. in 1602, the words of which run thus.
<Q>We ordain that in every Lapmark (that is province of Lap|land,) a certain regi&s;ter be made of all the fens, lakes and rivers, as likewi&s;e of the names and numbers of all tho&s;e, who hitherto have enjoyed the benefit of them. Secondly, that an exact ac|count be &s;tated, betwixt the number of families and that of the rivers and lakes, in order to make &s;uch an equitable divi&s;ion among them, that each family may not po&s;&s;e&s;s any more rivers and lakes, than are requi&s;ite for it's maintenance. Every Lapmark be|ing thus divided, hone&s;t and ju&s;t men are to be ap|pointed, who, without favour or affection, &s;hall a&s;|&s;ign to each family it's due proportion; after which time, it &s;hall not be lawful for any Laplander to
<PB N="176" REF="184">
wander at his own di&s;cretion, throughout the whole Lapmark, as has been the cu&s;tom hitherto.</Q></P>
<P>Since the time of this edict, each family has been confined to it's own allotment, it not being lawful for one to invade, or encroach upon, the property of an|ther. Though their former cu&s;tom of wandering from Lapmark to Lapmark was thus put a &s;top to, yet, their habitations are by no means &s;ettled, but they wander about within certain di&s;tricts, as convenience induces them; indeed, the nece&s;&s;ity of getting their livelihood, which depends on rein-deer, fi&s;h and wild animals, obliges them to &s;eek out for &s;uch places as will furni&s;h their rein-deer with pa&s;turage, and their families with fi&s;h and game. This change of habitation, mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o total, as that they leave, and ne|ver return to, their former ones; but they rather take a regular round, within the &s;pace of a year through all the parts of their allotment. This is the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e Laplanders who live among the mountains, but tho&s;e who take up their re&s;idence in the woods, return fre|quently to their dwellings in the cour&s;e of a year. Such as accu&s;tom them&s;elves to fi&s;hing, are careful to dwell always near their lakes or rivers in &s;pawning time, and tho&s;e who abound in rein-deer, remove in the win|ter to the woods, and in the &s;ummer to the mountains of Norway. When they travel thus, from place to place, they are not guided by the track of any high road, their being no &s;uch thing in Lapland, not even
<PB N="177" REF="185">
in the &s;ummer; but, they know how notwith&s;tanding to find out their huts, though at ever &s;o great a di&s;tance, as they will find out a bear or other wild bea&s;t when they once di&s;cover his track. In the winter-time they perform the&s;e circuits in their &s;ledges, of which I &s;hall &s;peak, by and by; in the &s;ummer they travel on foot, and carry their uten&s;ils in paniers, upon their rein-deer. The&s;e paniers are made of thin broad laths of flexible fir, &s;uch as the Dutch commonly make boxes of in the nature of band-boxes, the top of which is enclo&s;ed with lattice-work of birch twigs, which opens occa&s;ionally, and the bottom is covered with bark or &s;kins. The&s;e are hung over the back of the animal, by thongs, the bottom to the &s;ide of the bea&s;t, and the top outwards, a rein-deer thus loaded, will carry about 160lb. weight. Thus they not only remove their uten&s;ils, but their hou&s;hold furniture, and al&s;o their children, that are not able to walk, whom they hang on the &s;ides of the rein-deer, in their cradles. When they are thus removing their quarters, they proceed generally in the following order. In the front, walks the ma&s;ter of the family, followed by &s;everal rein-deer &s;o laden, then his wife, followed by other rein-deer, next, the remainder of the bea&s;ts, driven gently along in one herd by their chil|dren and &s;ervants, and the cavalcade clo&s;ed with him who has charge of the magical drum, of which I &s;hall give the reader a particular de&s;cription. The rein-deer thus laden, follow one another, the one behind be|ing
<PB N="178" REF="186">
tied to the panier of the one before, and the fore|mo&s;t led by the ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The mountain Laplanders build their huts but &s;lightly, becau&s;e they return but once a year; and, on quitting the place they de&s;troy them; but other Lap|landers, make theirs more durable, as they leave them &s;tanding. They fir&s;t erect them in the following man|ner. They fix four po&s;ts at as many corners, on the tops of which they place three cro&s;s-beams, &s;o that there &s;hall be one on each &s;ide, and one behind, but none acro&s;s the tops of the two foremo&s;t poles. On the&s;e cro&s;s-beams they &s;et up &s;ix long poles or rafters, leaning with their tops again&s;t each other, to form an angular roof, which they cover with a thick woollen cloth, called by them <HI>Waldmer,</HI> but the more opulent cover this again with linen.</P>
<P>The wood Laplanders make their huts either of boards, or &s;ix po&s;ts meeting at the top in the form of a cone, the bottom of which is a &s;exagon, covered with branches of fir, the bark of fir or turf. To this hut they have a door before and behind; the fore-door is the common entrance, but the back-door is &s;acred to the men, through this they bring in the provi&s;ion of the day, which they catch in hunting, and here they perform their &s;acrifices to their God <HI>Thor.</HI> The women are forbidden to go out through this door, becau&s;e the men, who always pa&s;s this way, when they go out hunt|ing
<PB N="179" REF="187">
con&s;ider it as an ill-omen to meet a woman at &s;uch times. The&s;e hou&s;es or huts are not divided by partitions, but the &s;everal chambers are di&s;tingui&s;hed by logs or pieces of wood laid on the ground, and the whole compa&s;s of the hut is &s;o contrived, that the hearth of &s;tone can be placed in the center. The &s;moke ri&s;es through the top, which is open. In the&s;e huts &s;leep the whole family, the ma&s;ter with his wife and daughters on one &s;ide the fire-place; his &s;ons, and the men and maid-&s;ervants, on the other. A hut in Dani&s;h Lapland, has al&s;o no light but what enters by a hole in the top. None of the&s;e northern nations make u&s;e of beds. The whole family, matter, mi&s;tre&s;s, children, men and maids lie down all together, very familiarly, on bear &s;kins, &s;pread in the middle of the room, and when they ri&s;e in the morning, the &s;kins are taken up and laid by till they are wanted again at night, for the &s;ame occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The floor is covered with branches of birch-trees to keep them from wet, over which are &s;pread &s;kins of rein-deer, which &s;erve both for beds and chairs. The&s;e are their dwelling-places, in which two &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies are ob&s;erved, viz. No one in walking up and down the hut, mu&s;t follow him who is going out, but mu&s;t keep his turn between the fire and tho&s;e who &s;it about it, and no woman in cro&s;&s;ing the hut mu&s;t pa&s;s with her feet over the legs of a man, they con&s;idering it as ominous.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="188">Be&s;ides the&s;e huts, they have &s;tore-hou&s;es, where they keep their fle&s;h, fi&s;h and other provi&s;ions; the&s;e are erected with wood on the trunk of a tree, after all the branches are cut off, not unlike our pidgeon hou&s;es, built upon po&s;ts, &s;o that they are about nine or ten feet from the ground; the door is at the bottom like a trap-door, to which they have acce&s;s, by &s;teps cut out in the trunk of the tree, like a ladder. The&s;e lofty &s;tore-hou&s;es are de&s;igned to &s;ecure their provi&s;ions from wild bea&s;ts, and to prevent their climbing, the &s;teps are con&s;tantly grea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The men in the &s;ummer wear brogues reaching down to their feet, clo&s;e to their body, over which they have a coat or loo&s;e garment, reaching to the middle of the leg, and tied round the wai&s;t with a girdle. They wear no linen, their clothes being made of a light-grey coar&s;e woollen cloth, called <HI>Waldmar.</HI> But the richer &s;ort of people, wear better cloth of different colours, green, blue and red. Black they never wear. Even the better &s;ort of people make u&s;e of coar&s;e woollen when at home, and employed in daily work. The girdle is generally leather, &s;tudded with tin, and a tin buckle; the more opulent decorate theirs with &s;ilver &s;tuds, which re&s;emble a &s;emicircular button. At the girdle hangs a knife in a &s;heath, with a &s;quare pouch, rather longer than broad, with a pur&s;e, and a ca&s;e with needles and thread. The knives are brought from Norway, and the &s;heath, which is made of rein-deer
<PB N="181" REF="189">
&s;kin, is &s;ewed together with tin-wire thread, and embroidered with the &s;ame, and at the end of which hang &s;everal rings. The pouch is al&s;o made of rein-deer &s;kin, the hairy &s;ide outwards; over which is an|other &s;kin of the &s;ame &s;ize, and this again they cover with red, green or blue cloth, ornamented with tin|wire thread. In this pouch they keep a cry&s;tal-&s;tone, with which they &s;trike fire, a &s;teel with &s;ome brim&s;tone, &s;ome tobacco, and other odd things. Their pur&s;e is of the &s;ame leather, &s;haped like a pear, here they keep their money and things of value; at the end of it hang abundance of rings. Their needle-ca&s;es are al&s;o de|corated in the &s;ame manner. Be&s;ides the&s;e, they wear abundance of bra&s;s chains and rings on the girdle, as well as mo&s;t other parts of the body. The pouch hangs down before, below the girdle, the re&s;t on both &s;ides. On their heads they wear a cap, which the better &s;ort cover with &s;ome &s;kin. In &s;hape, they re&s;emble our night-caps, are made of &s;ome coloured cloth, or of hare-fur, twi&s;ted and knit like our &s;tockings, &s;ome|times they are made of the <HI>Loom-bird</HI> &s;kin, with the feathers on. (In Dani&s;h Lapland, this cap re&s;embles a &s;eaman's bonnet, but made of rein-deer &s;kin, with the hair outwards, and bordered with white or grey fox-&s;kin.) They have al&s;o a method of fitting the whole bird with his head and wings to their heads, which is not unbecoming. They wear gloves like ours; their &s;hoes are of a peculiar make, made of rein-deer &s;kin, with the hair on and all of one piece, except that they
<PB N="182" REF="190">
are &s;ewed together at the bottom, on which they tread; &s;o that the hair of the one part lies forwards, that of the other, backwards; this is contrived to prevent their &s;lipping. They put their feet into a hole in the top, the toe is pointed and bends upwards, and the &s;eams are &s;trengthened with &s;ome narrow pieces of red cloth. They wear them on their bare-feet, and tie them on with leather &s;trings, wound three or four times round their ancles. That they may &s;it clo&s;e to the feet, they &s;tuff them with hay.</P>
<P>When the gnats are trouble&s;ome, they wear leather garments, and in the winter, the men wear both coats and breeches of rough rein-deer &s;kin, called <HI>mudd.</HI> They have boots, gloves and caps of the &s;ame, and their caps at this time of year, cover all the head like a hood, reaching down round the &s;houlders, and having only a hole before ju&s;t big enough to look through.</P>
<P>The women in &s;ummer-time wear long coats, which cover their brea&s;ts, arms and whole body, being laid in pleats from the middle downwards. The&s;e they call <HI>volpi,</HI> and are worn over their bare &s;kins, having no linen. The women al&s;o wear girdles, but broader than the mens, and in&s;tead of &s;tuds, ornamented with plates a finger's length and more, on which are engraved birds, flowers and the like; the&s;e are fa&s;tened upon leather, &s;o clo&s;e to each other, that the whole girdle &s;eems to be but one piece of tin. The richer &s;ort make the&s;e of
<PB N="183" REF="191">
&s;ilver. From this girdle hang abundance of bra&s;s chains, and on one of them a knife and &s;heath, on an|other a pouch, on another a needle-ca&s;e, and on all a great many bra&s;s rings, and all hung before, to the weight of 20 lbs. and more. But this weight they di&s;|regard, as they like the jingling it makes, and think it adds to their beauty.</P>
<P>They wear al&s;o a kind of tippet, made of coloured cloth, which &s;urrounds the neck about a hand's breadth, and coming down on both &s;ides below the brea&s;ts, ends in a narrow point. This they adorn with many &s;tuds upon the brea&s;t, and &s;ometimes about the neck, en|graved with all &s;orts of figures, and with &s;mall chains hanging on them. On their heads they wear a kind of round red cap or bonnet, flat on the top; on their legs, &s;tockings that reach only ju&s;t below the ancle, and on their feet, &s;hoes like the men. In the winter, their garments are like tho&s;e of the men, both &s;exes wearing breeches in cold weather. Women unmarried or mar|ried wear the &s;ame habits. At night they cover them|&s;elves all over with woollen blankets or rugs, to defend them&s;elves from the gnats, which in &s;ummer are very trouble&s;ome, and to remove the inconvenience of their weight, they &s;u&s;pend them at &s;ome di&s;tance from their bodies, by &s;trings fa&s;tened to the top of their huts. Under the&s;e coverlids, upon one or two rein-deer &s;kins they lie quite naked, both in &s;ummer and winter.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="192">Women's cloaths in Dani&s;h Lapland, are made either of coar&s;e cloth, or rein-deer &s;kins with the hair outwards. Their &s;tockings are of the &s;ame, their &s;hoes of fi&s;h-&s;kin, with the &s;cales on, and re&s;emble the wood|en &s;hoes in France, having nothing to fa&s;ten them on. Their coifs are like tho&s;e of the Norwegian women. Their hair is twi&s;ted up into two braids or tre&s;&s;es, one of which hangs down on one &s;houlder, and one on the other. Their coif is made of coar&s;e canvas, and all their linen is of the &s;ame kind; &s;ome of them wear a ruff eight fingers broad, which they tie behind them as gyp&s;ies do. In Mu&s;covy Lapland, the women em|broider their own and their hu&s;band's clothes on the edges with tin&s;el thread, which they draw between their teeth, as fine as wire-drawers do their threads of gold and &s;ilver with a drawing-iron.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of their Magical Arts and Ceremonies.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is &s;carce a country under the &s;un, where the name of Lapland has reached, but what has heard of their magic, which is not yet quite aboli&s;hed among them. The&s;e countries, &s;ays Olaus Magnus,
<PB N="185" REF="193">
&s;peaking of Finland and Lapland, (but who was a very credulous man,) were in the time of pagani&s;m, &s;o well in&s;tructed in &s;orcery, as if they had been di&s;ciples of Zoroa&s;ter, the Per&s;ian. They are &s;uch prodigious &s;or|cerers, &s;ays Peter Claudi, writing of the Norwegian Laplanders of later times, that I much que&s;tion whe|ther they ever could, or can now, be matched in this art, by any upon earth. At pre&s;ent, however, they do not practi&s;e it &s;o frequently, nor &s;o publicly as they did in former times, the king of Sweden having put a &s;top to it by &s;evere laws. The rea&s;on the people give for u&s;ing it, is to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the evil de&s;igns of their countrymen, for which rea&s;on parents in&s;truct their children in the art, and when they die, bequeath to them as part of their inheritance, &s;uch &s;pi|rits and daemons as they have found &s;erviceable to them&s;elves. Were I to mention the many wonderous &s;tories and miracles, which many re&s;pectable writers have &s;aid they have wrought, the reader would only laugh at me, for magic in this enlightened age, is wholly exploded. But, according to the opinion of Laplanders, certain families have their own daemons, not only differing from the familiar &s;pirits of others, but al&s;o quite contrary and oppo&s;ite to them, that is, &s;pirits belonging to them, ho&s;tile to tho&s;e of others, and &s;ecuring them again&s;t the daemons of other fami|lies. Some Laplanders are weak enough to believe, that they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a daemon from their very in|fancy, and &s;ome from the time of manhood. Whil&s;t
<PB N="186" REF="194">
he was bu&s;y in the woods, a Laplander will tell you, a &s;pirit appeared to him and offered him a&s;&s;i&s;tance on certain conditions, which he accepted. This &s;ettled, the daemon taught him a certain &s;ong, which he is obliged to keep in con&s;tant remembrance. The&s;e &s;pi|rits, &s;ay they, appear under different &s;hapes, &s;ome like fi&s;hes, &s;ome birds, others like a &s;erpent or dragon, others in the &s;hape of pigmies, about three feet high. No &s;ooner are they &s;eized, as they &s;uppo&s;e by the ge|nius, but they appear like madmen, bereaved of rea|&s;on. This continues for &s;ix months, during which time, they do not &s;uffer any of their family or relations to come near them; but, range about the woods and other &s;olitary places, melancholy and thoughtful, &s;carce taking any food; which renders them extremely weak. If you a&s;k their children where, or how, they receive their &s;u&s;tenance, they will tell you, from their genii.</P>
<P>In every hou&s;e in Dani&s;h Lapland, there is a large black cat, which is highly re&s;pected by them. The Laplanders talk to it, as if it was a rational creature, and go out of their huts every night with it to con&s;ult it alone, and it will follow them like a dog, either a fi&s;hing or hunting. Though this animal looks like a cat, I &s;hould have believed it, &s;ays the French gentleman, (whom I have mentioned,) had I had but a little more &s;uper&s;tition, to have been a familiar &s;pirit mini&s;tring to them.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="195">Whenever a Laplander, &s;ays Lundius, has occa&s;ion for his familiar &s;pirit, he calls to him and makes him come, by merely &s;inging the &s;ong he taught him at the fir&s;t interview, by which means, he has him at his &s;er|vice whenever he plea&s;es; but they never appear to the women, or enter into <HI>their</HI> &s;ervice. To exerci&s;e their &s;orceries, they have recour&s;e to certain in&s;truments, a drum, knots, darts, &s;pells and the like. The magical drum, called by the natives <HI>Quobdas</HI> or <HI>Rannus,</HI> is made out of the hollow trunk of a pine, fir or birch-tree, growing in certain particular places, and turning ac|cording to the cour&s;e of the &s;un. It is made out of the root, cleft a&s;under, and hollowed out on one &s;ide, over which they &s;tretch a &s;kin, the other &s;ide is convex, with a handle rai&s;ed by notching the wood deep on each &s;ide of it. They re&s;emble our kettle-drums, but are of an oval form. On the &s;kin which covers this drum they draw in red paint, made of the bark of an alder-tree, boiled and beaten, various figures of their own Gods, as well as of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the apo&s;tles, &s;un, moon, &s;tars, birds and rivers. Whenever they are di&s;|po&s;ed to beat this drum, (which they often do, with a &s;hort piece of rein-deers horn, the end of which bran|ches out like the capital Y; they place a large bra&s;s ring with &s;everal &s;mall ones &s;trung on it, on a figure drawn for the &s;un, in the centre of the &s;kin that covers this drum, which when beaten, dances over the&s;e figures, and according to it's progre&s;s, the &s;orcerer progno&s;ti|cates, The Finlanders, bordering upon Norway, and
<PB N="188" REF="196">
&s;ubject to the crown of Denmark, u&s;e the&s;e drums like|wi&s;e. They are con&s;idered as &s;acred things, are always carefully wrapped up, and never &s;uffered to be touched by marriageable women. If a family drum is to be removed from one part of the country to another, it is either carried la&s;t of all and by the hands of a man, or el&s;e mu&s;t be brought, by a quite different road, or &s;ome untrod way, le&s;t if any one, but more e&s;pecially a woman &s;hould pa&s;s the &s;ame way after it, it might en|danger her health, if not her life. Should it &s;o happen, &s;ays Wormius, that a woman is obliged to travel the &s;ame way, through which the drum has been carried before, &s;he pre&s;ents a bra&s;s ring for the u&s;e of the drum, to break the enchantment.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e &s;uper&s;titious people weakly imagine they can effect four things by the help of this drum, viz. to learn what is pa&s;&s;ing in di&s;tant places, though never &s;o remote; to know the good and bad &s;ucce&s;s of any undertaking; what i&s;&s;ue any di&s;temper is likely to have; to cure di&s;ea&s;es, and to know what &s;ort of &s;a|crifice their Gods are be&s;t plea&s;ed with. The drum|mers are generally men who are bred to the profe&s;&s;ion, live by it, and tho&s;e who wi&s;h to con&s;ult them, pay in proportion to the enquiries they make. He who beats the drum kneels down, as do all the per&s;ons pre|&s;ent, and &s;ings a &s;ong with a loud voice. After he has done beating it, he falls down, with his face on the ground, and the drum over his head, as if in a trance,
<PB N="189" REF="197">
the men and women pre&s;ent, continue their &s;inging without intermi&s;&s;ion, till the drum-beater is awakened from his trance, to put him in mind of what is de|&s;ired to be known, and take &s;ingular care that no fly or in&s;ect incommodes him; for they imagine, if he was either di&s;turbed, or they were to di&s;continue &s;inging, he never would come to life again. When the man awakes from his trance, in which he is &s;ometimes many hours, and during which time they conceive his &s;oul to have left his body, he tells what he has been able to learn, by help of his drum.</P>
<P>Another in&s;trument of their magic is a cord with knots, which they u&s;e, to rai&s;e a wind. And northern ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els are &s;uch dupes to the arts of the&s;e impo&s;tors, as to buy the&s;e cords, in order to procure the gale they have occa&s;ion for. Of three knots tied in this cord, by loo&s;ening the fir&s;t, they are to have a tolerable fair wind, at untying the &s;econd, a very fre&s;h gale, but by loo&s;ening the third, they are to have very tempe&s;tuous weather; this art of magic is mo&s;t prac|ti&s;ed by tho&s;e Laplanders &s;ubject to the crown of Nor|way, and who live upon that coa&s;t. The mariners of tho&s;e &s;eas, are al&s;o weak enough to &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e magicians can &s;top a &s;hip in full &s;ail, let the wind blow never &s;o &s;trong; and that there is no remedy again&s;t this enchantment, but by &s;mearing the ma&s;ts and doors of the ve&s;&s;el with the men&s;trual blood of virgins, which was the opinion of Pliny, (<HI>Lib.</HI> 28. c. 7.) I am very
<PB N="190" REF="198">
apt to believe, &s;ays he, what is related of the men&s;trual blood, <HI>viz.</HI> that it de&s;troys all magical arts, if &s;meared only on the po&s;ts of the doors.</P>
<P>The French traveller whom I have already men|tioned, gives us the following relation of this magical proce&s;s, but as his account is wonderful, and not ac|companied with his name, we mu&s;t leave the credit of it to our readers.</P>
<P>We were becalmed on the Finland coa&s;t; &s;ome of our crew were &s;o &s;uper&s;titious as to give credit to the common opinion, that the inhabitants of the country under the artic-polar circle, as well as tho&s;e that dwelt on the coa&s;ts of the &s;ea of Finland, are wind-mer|chants, and can rai&s;e and &s;ell a gale when they plea&s;e. It is certain, they are almo&s;t all of them wizards, and as children of the prince of the air, pretend to di&s;po&s;e of the wind, as their proper merchandize. We were weary of lying upon that coa&s;t, and this led us to try means to get off, however impo&s;&s;ible the&s;e means might &s;eem to be. The captain of our &s;hip was for trading with the wizards, accordingly he &s;ent his long-boat a&s;hore, with his mate, to trade with &s;ome of the&s;e men, and purcha&s;e a wind, a commodity we then &s;tood much in need of. Though I believed nothing of the matter, I had the curio&s;ity to accompany him. We landed at the fir&s;t village we came to, and applied our&s;elves to the chief necromancer, told him what we wanted, and
<PB N="191" REF="199">
a&s;ked, if he could furni&s;h us with a wind that would la&s;t till we reached Mourman&s;kimre. The conjuror gravely replied, No; and told us his power extended no farther than the promontory of Rouxella. It being a great way to that place, we thought if we got there, we might ea&s;ily make the north-cape, of cour&s;e re|que&s;ted him to go on board with us, and make his bar|gain with the captain. The wizard con&s;ented, took three of his comrades with him, leaped into a &s;mall fi&s;hing-boat, and accompanied us to the &s;hip. The price was &s;oon agreed on, (ten <HI>Kronen,</HI> about 35 or 36 &s;hillings Engli&s;h, and a pound of tobacco,) for which the wizard was to furni&s;h us with a fair wind to Rouxella. The money being paid, he tied a woollen|rag to the corner of our fore-ma&s;t. It was about half a yard long, and a nail in breadth, with three knots in it. This was all the captain had for his ten <HI>Kronen.</HI> When the necromancer had done this feat, he returned on &s;hore with his companions. The captain, agreeable to the in&s;tructions he had received from the conjuror, untied the fir&s;t knot in the rag, and it &s;o happened, that the wind immediately blew we&s;t, &s;outh-we&s;t, a bri&s;k gale, and carried us thirty leagues beyond Mael&s;troom, without giving our captain any occa&s;ion to untie the &s;econd knot, and this accident confirmed our crew in their diabolical &s;uper&s;tition. This Mael&s;troom is an eddy or whirl-pool in the Norwegian &s;ea, in which many ve&s;&s;els that approach too near it, have peri&s;hed, (of which we &s;hall &s;peak more in our account of
<PB N="192" REF="200">
Norway.) The wind beginning to &s;hift a little, and inclining to the north, our captain untied a &s;econd knot, which kept it in it's old corner till we made the promontory of Rouxella. When we had pa&s;&s;ed it, the needle of our compa&s;s turned back half an inch, which led &s;ome to fancy there was load-&s;tone in the mountain, and had we not had a very dexterous pilot, we &s;hould certainly have lo&s;t our cour&s;e. We were two days and two nights in this dangerous &s;ituation, having nothing to depend upon but our pilot's expe|rience. On the third day, being far di&s;tant from the mountains of Rouxella, the needle of our compa&s;s pointed again to it's center, from which we concluded that we drew near the north-cape, where the wind fail|ing us, our captain untied the third knot, at which there aro&s;e a north north-ea&s;t wind, &s;o violent, that we thought the heavens would fall on us, and that God was going ju&s;tly to puni&s;h us for not relying on his providence, but dealing with infernal arti&s;ts. We could bear no &s;ail during the tempe&s;t. Our &s;hip drove at the mercy of the winds and waves, and we expected every in&s;tant to go to the bottom. Every one fell on his knees and begged God's pardon. I own, I never was &s;o much afraid in all my life, and I believe the whole crew were in equal con&s;ternation, when by good|luck, or through Divine mercy, the extraordinary force and agitation of the waves prevented our &s;triking, and drove us a mu&s;ket-&s;hot off the rocks, for we had been driven very near the &s;hore. On the fourth day the
<PB N="193" REF="201">
wind was laid, and, being pretty fair, we, in two days after, put into port.</P>
<P>A third in&s;trument of their magic, is a leaden dart, about four inches long, which they &s;uppo&s;e the magi|cian can &s;end forth to a great di&s;tance, to take revenge of their enemies, who are thereupon &s;eized with a cancerous tumour in the legs or arms, &s;o as to de&s;troy them in three days.</P>
<P>They have a variety of other magical contrivances to bring about certain purpo&s;es, which it would tire the readers patience to relate. The magic cord in|deed, to procure favourable winds, is a very common traffic on the banks of the red &s;ea, and is managed with great addre&s;s on the part of the magician, who thus keeps up the price of his knotted Tali&s;man.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the Diet of the Lapland Nation, and their Manner of Catching their Food, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE general diet of the people is not the &s;ame all over Lapland; for, as the Laplanders are divided into high-land and wood-land, &s;o there is a
<PB N="194" REF="202">
remarkable difference in their food. The Lapland mountainers or <HI>Fi&agrave;l-Lappais,</HI> &s;ays Samuel Rheen, live upon their cattle, and, not being accu&s;tomed to fi&s;hing, they live upon fle&s;h, chee&s;e and milk, all of which their rein-deer &s;upply them with; be&s;ides which, they frequently, about mid&s;ummer, purcha&s;e &s;heep, goats and oxen, from Norway, which they milk in the &s;um|mer and kill in autumn. Their food then in the &s;pring is chiefly chee&s;e and dried fi&s;h; in the winter, &s;carce any thing but the fle&s;h of rein-deer boiled: Rein-deer veni&s;on is very good food, and the fat and marrow, a delicacy, as with us. They eat al&s;o the blood of the rein-deer, boiled with water to the con&s;i&s;tence of a poultice.</P>
<P>The wood Laplanders, or <HI>Graan-Lappars,</HI> as they are called, feed partly upon fi&s;h, and partly upon wild-fowl and wild-bea&s;ts, which they catch in the fore&s;ts. Among all the wild-bea&s;ts, bears fle&s;h is mo&s;t in e&s;|teem, and their greate&s;t delicacy. They have al&s;o certain &s;auces made of black-berries, &s;trawberries, a kind of mulberries, and the like, of the wild angelica, and the inner rind of the pine-tree. This is all the Laplanders food; for bread and &s;alt are things known only to few. As they neither &s;ow nor reap, they have no flour; what they have, is from Norway. In|&s;tead of flour, they u&s;e dried fi&s;h, which they grind to powder. In&s;tead of &s;alt, they &s;ea&s;on their food with the inner rind of the pine-tree, which they &s;lice into
<PB N="195" REF="203">
thin &s;kins, no thicker than parchment, dry in the &s;un, then cut it into &s;mall pieces, put it up clo&s;e in boxes made of bark, bury it in the &s;ands for 24 hours, kind|ling a good fire over the hole, which turns it red, and makes it very palatable. As a relick of popery, they ab&s;tain from fle&s;h every friday, eating fi&s;h, milk or chee&s;e. They boil their meat fre&s;h, ju&s;t enough to heat it through, in order to pre&s;erve the gravy, and make, as they think, their broth the better. They fre|quently boil fi&s;h and fle&s;h in the &s;ame kettle, but their fle&s;h dried in the &s;un or air, they eat without further dre&s;&s;ing; boiling only the bones, for the &s;ake of the marrow.</P>
<P>Their drink is commonly water, which to prevent it's freezing, they keep in a kettle hanging over the fire; but, they occa&s;ionally drink the water in which their fi&s;h or fle&s;h has been boiled, and &s;ometimes whey. Ale and beer u&s;ed among other northern nations is un|known to them, being de&s;titute both of barley and hops. But when they make merry, or drink for plea|&s;ure, French brandy is their liquor, and nothing will &s;o &s;oon win their hearts as a pre&s;ent of it. To allay the heat in the mouth occa&s;ioned by the brandy, they u&s;e a juice of berries, which they pre&s;erve again&s;t the winter. The &s;ame French gentleman I have mention|ed, tells us, that the Laplanders of Denmark, have a &s;our liquor, which they drink with greater gout than either beer or brandy, and it is made by an infu&s;ion of
<PB N="196" REF="204">
juniper-berries, and a grain like lentils, both which grow there in plenty. They make a brandy of the &s;ame grain, and it has the &s;ame effect as that drawn from the grape. Though it is as &s;trong as French wine, this traveller &s;ays, they drink it as common drink, among the Swedi&s;h Laplanders. The u&s;e of tobacco is much in fa&s;hion, which they purcha&s;e from Norway, and of which, they make &s;nuff. Indeed the&s;e northern nations, where bread and &s;alt is &s;o &s;carce, have &s;o particular an inclination for tobacco, that it is almo&s;t fatal to them.</P>
<P>In the winter, they eat within their huts, in the &s;um|mer, on the gra&s;s, without them. They &s;it or lye down in a circle, without any ceremony or precedency, every one taking his place, where he lights fir&s;t, and without either bench or &s;tool, but merely on a &s;kin, with their legs under them. In this circle they draw a piece of board, or &s;tump of a tree before them by way of table. Their meat when taken out of the ket|tle, is laid on a piece of woollen cloth, (for plates or di&s;hes they have none,) and in better hou&s;es upon lin|en. Any liquid thing, they put upon a wooden tray. They take up their meat with their hands, and for want of plates, put it on their gloves or caps. Their drink is taken up in a wooden ladle, which &s;erves them for a cup. They are great eaters when they have any thing to eat, at other times, can fa&s;t as well as tho&s;e who have none; are never &s;paring of their food, but
<PB N="197" REF="205">
will eat day and night while it la&s;ts, though their ge|neral meals are but twice a day, morning and evening. There are two things they never omit at meals, one is to &s;ay grace after them; and next following the grace, to exhort one another to mutual faith and charity, giv|ing each other the hand as a pledge of that reciprocal attachment, which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between per&s;ons of the &s;ame family. Whil&s;t grace is &s;aid, they lift up their hands by way of acknowledgment, and the words are to this purpo&s;e.
<Q>Good God, be prai&s;ed for this meat, and grant that what we have now eaten, may conduce to the &s;trengthening of our bodies!</Q></P>
<P>Having &s;hewn what the Laplanders live on, let us next &s;ee how they procure their food. This is by hunt|ing, the chief employment of the men. There are certain days of the year, which they con&s;ider as omi|nous, &s;uch as St. Catherine's, St. Mark's, and St. Cle|ment's, on the&s;e they never hunt, le&s;t their bows &s;hould break, and they &s;hould have ill-&s;ucce&s;s all the year after. Be&s;ides, they never attempt to hunt, till they have con&s;ulted their drum; and, if they meet a woman in their way, they have &s;mall hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. It is for this rea&s;on, as I ob&s;erved, that the women are never &s;uffered to go out of their huts at the &s;ame door, with the men. They eat but little before they go abroad, in hopes of returning &s;oon, and &s;eldom take any food with them but a little rein-deer marrow, which they
<PB N="198" REF="206">
conceive &s;trengthens their legs: if they are not &s;ucce&s;s|ful, they fa&s;t the whole day.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer-time they hunt on foot with dogs, which are of a very good &s;ort, both for &s;cent and attack, and to make them fiercer, they keep them always tied up: but in winter, they track the wild-bea&s;ts in the &s;now, and follow the track, with long wooden &s;cates on their feet, which I &s;hall pre&s;ently de&s;cribe. Small bea&s;ts they kill with bows and arrows, the larger ones, with &s;pears and fire-arms. Ermines and beavers are caught in traps, as we catch mice; and &s;quirrels they kill with blunt darts, that their &s;kins may not be injured; indeed they are careful, with pointed darts not to &s;trike the animal in a part that will injure the &s;kin, and they are the be&s;t mark&s;men in the world. Hares are caught in &s;nares, and whoever finds one &s;nared, will always re|&s;tore it to the right owner. The rein-deer is killed at rutting time; by tying a doe to a tree, the bucks will &s;oon come about her, and when they are within gun|&s;hot, they fire at them, but in the &s;pring they &s;oon overtake them, with their &s;cates.</P>
<P>Bear-hunting I &s;hall treat of more particularly, as it is attended with more than ordinary, &s;uper&s;tition. The fir&s;t &s;tep they take is, to trace out the bear's den, by their track in the &s;now, and he who finds it is &s;aid to have <HI>circumvented</HI> him, and has the chief manage|ment of the hunt. When a den is di&s;covered, they
<PB REF="207">

<PB N="199" REF="208">
joyfully invite their relations and friends to the &s;port, with the &s;ame ceremony as we invite our friends to a fea&s;t, bear's-fle&s;h being their greate&s;t dainty. This is about March or April, when the &s;now is deepe&s;t, and they can be&s;t make u&s;e of their &s;cates. When their friends are a&s;&s;embled, they fix upon a drummer, who is to con&s;ult his drum, whether they &s;hall be able to kill the bear or not. Encouraged with the hope of &s;ucce&s;s, they march in good order to the fore&s;t; he who traced the bear being at the head of them with a &s;pear: next to him walks the drummer, and after him, he who is to make the fir&s;t attack, and &s;o on, according to the office they are to be employed in; one to kill the bear, one to boil the fle&s;h, another to divide it, and another to fetch water and wood; and, they are very particular not to encroach upon one another's office. When they reach the bear's den, they fall on courageou&s;ly with &s;pears, and fire-arms, till they have killed him; this done, they &s;ing a &s;ong in token of their victory. They have peculiar &s;ongs for this purpo&s;e; that which they &s;ing on killing him runs thus, <HI>Kittulis pourra, Kittulis ii&s;kada, &s;oubbi jalla Zaiiti,</HI> which is,
<Q>thanking, the bear for coming there, and that he did not hurt their per&s;ons nor break their &s;pears in killing him.</Q>
After they have proclaimed their victory, they drag the bear out, beating him with rods and &s;mall &s;ticks, They then put him on a &s;ledge and draw him home, where they mean to boil him, &s;inging all the way, <HI>Ii Paha talki oggio, ii paha talki Pharonis;</HI> that is,
<Q>pray|ing
<PB N="200" REF="209">
the bear, not to rai&s;e tempe&s;ts, or do any harm to his murderers.</Q>
The rein-deer that draws the bear, is not to be u&s;ed any more that year. As they ap|proach their hut they are met by their wives, whom in a &s;ong they reque&s;t to chew &s;ome bark of an elder-tree, and &s;pit it in their faces, in order to give them the ap|pearance of having lo&s;t blood in the encounter, for the elder-bark chewed, is of a red-colour. As each en|ters the back-door, his wife &s;pits in his face. They are no &s;ooner entered, than the women &s;ing <HI>Kittulis pourra toukoris,</HI> i. e. "Thanks to you dear hu&s;band." They then proceed to flea and boil the bear, and fea&s;t upon it; after which the men retire to a hut erected for them&s;elves, it being forbidden, for any one pre&s;ent at a bear-hunt, to cohabit with their wives for the next three days. No woman enters the huts where they boil the bear. The &s;kin is the property of the man who traced the animal, and the fle&s;h, after they have eaten their fill, is divided among them, certain parts to cer|tain men. Two are deputed to carry the womens &s;hare to their hut, &s;inging as they go, <HI>Olmai potti Sweri&s;gi&s;andi, Polandi, Engelandi, Frankichis,</HI> intimating, that they came from foreign parts with the pre&s;ent from Sweden, Po|land, England and France. The women go out to meet them, &s;inging <HI>Olmai potti Swerigi&s;landi, Polandi, Engelandi, Frankichis, kalka kaub&s;is laigit touti tiadnat,</HI> i. e.
<Q>You men who are come from Sweden, Poland, England and France, we will tie red-&s;trings round your legs,</Q>
which they accordingly do. All this

over, he who had the &s;kin for his &s;hare, hangs it on a pole for the women to &s;hoot at with darts, blind-folded, &s;inging at the &s;ame time, and &s;he who fir&s;t hits the &s;kin bears the bell, her hu&s;band being &s;uppo&s;ed to be the man that &s;hall kill the next bear. The women then work tin-wire cro&s;&s;es or pieces of cloth, and the&s;e the hunters wear about their necks, for three days. To conclude the whole, when the men after the three days, return to their huts and wives, each takes hold of a chain that &s;u&s;pends the kettle, and after they have dan|ced round the fire three times, they run out at the common door, the women &s;inging and throwing a&s;hes upon them as they go. Done as &s;uppo&s;ed as an ex|piation to clean&s;e them, they being thought, till after this ceremony, unclean and not fit to cohabit with their wives.</P>
<P>It being con&s;idered as the greate&s;t piece of bravery in a Laplander to kill a bear, &s;uch as have, adorn their caps with as many tin-wire laces as they have killed bears.</P>
<P>Birds they kill with &s;nares and fire-arms, and as often as they kill one with a gun, they pull out two of the large&s;t feathers from the left wing, and throw it down at the place where the bird was &s;hot, to appea&s;e the anger of the gods of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="211">It is evident from what has been &s;aid, that the Lap|landers mu&s;t; u&s;e &s;everal &s;orts of weapons in hunting. The fir&s;t are their bows, which are about three yards long, made with birch-wood lined with a &s;lip of pine, as giving a greater ela&s;ticity to them, glued in by glue made of the &s;kins of pearch boiled. The&s;e bows they draw by the mere &s;trength of their arm, but they have cro&s;s-bows made of &s;teel, the &s;tring of which they draw by an iron hook fa&s;tened to their girdle, &s;etting the foot within a ring fa&s;tened to the head of the bow, &s;o that they have the whole power of the body to draw the &s;tring to the nut, which holds it. Their arrows are of two &s;orts, one pointed with iron or horn, and the other blunt, to kill an animal without wounding the &s;kin. Their guns and cro&s;s-bows they have from Sueder|tramden, a town of Helfingerland, famous for ar|mourers and gun-&s;miths, from whence al&s;o they are &s;upplied with gun-powder and lead for &s;hot. The mountainers &s;ometimes get their guns from Norway, and will give from eight to ten crowns for a good one.</P>
<P>I mentioned above, that the Laplanders pur&s;ued wild-bea&s;ts over the &s;now by means of long wooden &s;cates. The&s;e are long &s;lips of wood eight or nine feet in length, and about twice as broad as the foot. One &s;cate is generally a foot longer than the other. The bottom is covered with rein-deer &s;kin with the hair on, the grain of which turns backwards, in order to pre|vent
<PB N="203" REF="212">
their &s;lipping back. The&s;e are fa&s;tened to the feet by withs that govern the foot, and the withs tied round the leg. With the&s;e &s;cates, by the help of a &s;tick, with a round piece of wood at the bottom, to prevent it's entering the &s;now, will they drive them|&s;elves along &s;o incredibly &s;wift, as to overtake the fleete&s;t rein-deer; and, what is a&s;toni&s;hing, they will, by writhing and twi&s;ting their bodies, a&s;cend by wind|ings the highe&s;t mountains, and de&s;cend from the tops again without any danger of falling, which &s;eems next to an impo&s;&s;ibility. In climbing the rocks, the hair of the &s;kins with which the &s;cates are covered, prevents their going backward, and when they de&s;cend, their motion is as &s;wift as the wind. Some u&s;e the&s;e &s;cates better than others, but tho&s;e who are ma&s;ters of the art of &s;cating, will travel 50 miles in a day, and after drinking about a gla&s;s of wine, will appear as fre&s;h and hearty as if they had never &s;tirred out. The Swedes call this way of &s;liding, <HI>Skriidabini.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of their Employment.</HEAD>
<P>THE chief employment of the men, as I have ob&s;erved, is hunting; but, they have other bu&s;ine&s;s, in providing the nece&s;&s;aries of life. Among the&s;e, cookery claims the fir&s;t place, for all their food is procured and dre&s;&s;ed by the men, &s;o that the wo|men never interfere in the kitchen, unle&s;s the men are ab&s;ent. The Laplanders are al&s;o their own boat-build|ers, which are made of deal, fa&s;tened or &s;ewed together with twigs, and calked with mo&s;s. They are made about &s;ix yards long, and about one and a half broad, and are rowed with two or four oars, and are &s;o light, that one man can carry them. In the&s;e they will ven|ture upon the mo&s;t rapid rivers, generally naked in &s;ummer-time, to be ready for &s;wimming in ca&s;e of over&s;etting, and though they are timorous in other re&s;pects, when they are going to &s;ome great fair, or &s;olemn meeting, they will in the&s;e boats pa&s;s cataracts or water-falls, of half a league long betwixt the rocks, without any &s;ign of fear, alleging, that they are con|ducted on by their genii.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="214">They make al&s;o their own &s;ledges, which re&s;emble a boat, cut in half, boarded up at the &s;ection. The&s;e are round at the bottom, &s;o as to roll from &s;ide to &s;ide, the fore-part is turned upwards, to prevent any inter|ruption in pa&s;&s;ing the &s;now, and the top covered before about a yard in length with &s;eal-&s;kin, &s;tretched over hoops to keep out the &s;now, under which they &s;tuff mo&s;s or hay to warm their feet, leaning with their back again&s;t the upright piece at the other end. They are generally made about two yards long, and ju&s;t broad and capacious enough to hold one per&s;on.</P>
<P>The men are al&s;o dexterous in making boxes and large che&s;ts, which they inlay with bone. They are al&s;o &s;o clever at ba&s;ket-making, that no other nation can come up to them. The&s;e are made of the roots of trees, &s;teeped in hot-water, and &s;lit in long thin pieces, &s;o as to bend at plea&s;ure, which they twi&s;t and entwine &s;o clo&s;e together, that they will hold water like a &s;olid ve&s;&s;el. The&s;e ba&s;kets are much e&s;teemed in Sweden, and frequently tran&s;ported into foreign countries, for the goodne&s;s and beauty of their workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>They make all &s;orts of carpenters work, and ve&s;&s;els hollowed out of wood, with great art, and a variety of u&s;eful things in horn and bone, carved and inlaid. They have al&s;o a method of cutting flowers, bea&s;ts, &amp;c. in bone, by way of moulds, in which they ca&s;t tin, to wear on their girdles. Their hunting in&s;tru|ments
<PB N="206" REF="215">
they ornament very curiou&s;ly. All the&s;e things are made by the men, each for his own family, having received no in&s;tructions but from their parents, or what they acquire from their own ingenuity.</P>
<P>The employments peculiar to the women, are mak|ing cloaths and &s;hoes for them&s;elves and for the men, and harne&s;s for the rein-deer; and to effect this, they fir&s;t make their thread of rein-deer nerves, which are beaten and prepared like flax. Some of the&s;e threads they cover with tin-wire, like our &s;ilver thread. They al&s;o &s;pin wool for &s;wadling cloaths, and knit their white hare's-fur into caps, which the women wear as a de|fence again&s;t the cold, and are &s;ofter than &s;wans-down it&s;elf; they al&s;o weave their fillets with a &s;huttle. The method of drawing their tin-wire, de&s;erves to be parti|cularly mentioned, they having no other in&s;trument than a piece of horn with holes in it of different &s;izes, through which they draw the wire with their teeth, and will draw it as &s;mall as gold-wire, but in pieces of about an ell only in length. With the thread covered with this wire, they embroider their cloaths, and tho&s;e women who are mo&s;t expert at this, are be&s;t e&s;teemed. They al&s;o embroider their glove-tops, boot-tops and &s;hoes, in &s;o pretty a manner, and enrich their apparel with tin plates, ca&s;t in curious moulds, and &s;uch a variety of &s;pangles, as in a &s;un-&s;hiny day make a very glittering appearance. They decorate the trappings of their rein-deer in a &s;imilar manner.</P>
<P><PB REF="216"><FIGURE>
<HEAD>LAPLANDERS.</HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="217">As the women take part with the men in all their journeys, and each bears her &s;hare of the toil in tra|velling, they wear breeches as well as the men. In &s;ummer-time they travel on foot, in winter, in &s;uch &s;ledges as tho&s;e de&s;cribed, which having a flat part be|hind, the per&s;on within leans again&s;t it with his back, and is tied clo&s;e in with linen or leather-fillets, &s;o as to leave only the upper part of their bodies at liberty. This &s;ledge is drawn by one rein-deer, not joined to it, as we join our hor&s;es to a carriage; but, by a &s;ingle rope fa&s;tened on a thick cloth round the animals neck, and pa&s;&s;ing between his fore and hind legs to the prow, or head of the &s;ledge. He who rides, governs the bea&s;t with a &s;ingle rein fixed to his head and horns, which he holds in his right-hand by a &s;tick fa&s;tened at the end of it, and by which he can throw the rein at plea&s;ure, either on the right-&s;ide or the left. The &s;ledge he governs with his left-hand, for, being &s;e|micircular at bottom, it requires &s;ome care to ballance it, le&s;t it &s;hould over&s;et. They will thus travel, &s;ays Zeigler, 150,000 paces, or 30 German leagues in 24 hours, and the women are as expert, in conducting this machine as the men. The account of the journey made in 1653, by order of the northern company, erected at Copenhagen, by Frederic III. gives the fol|lowing de&s;cription of the &s;ledges in Ru&s;&s;ian Lapland, and their manner of travelling in the winter; but, it is in my opinion too marvellous to be credited. After we had agreed with our ho&s;t, &s;ays the writer, for &s;ome
<PB N="208" REF="218">
rein-deer, to carry us farther into the country, he &s;ounded a horn at the door of his hut, at which 14 or 15 rein-deer came running to him in&s;tantly, of which he cho&s;e &s;ix, for &s;o many &s;ledges. Being provided with a guide, when we were ready to go, our ho&s;t whi&s;pered in the ears of each rein-deer certain words, which we &s;uppo&s;ed were to direct them where to go; and in an in&s;tant, they began to run with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s over hills and valleys, continuing thus with|out intermi&s;&s;ion, till &s;even o'clock at night; when coming into a pretty large village, &s;ituate in a plain near a lake, they &s;topped at the fourth habitation, and all together &s;truck with their feet again&s;t the ground. The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e under&s;tanding the &s;ignal, came and took us out of the &s;ledges, and we were &s;oon equipped with other fre&s;h rein-deer. After the ma&s;ter had whi&s;pered into their ears, they ran very fa&s;t all night, without keeping any certain road, till about two or three o'clock in the afternoon, when coming to a &s;mall village on a hill, near a fore&s;t, the&s;e bea&s;ts &s;top|ped as the others did, but meeting with no inhabitants, we were obliged to bait them for an hour with the mo&s;s we could find, and refre&s;hed our&s;elves with what provi&s;ions we had. This done, we were for continuing our journey, but it was not without a great deal of trouble, that our guide could make them go further, this being the place appointed by their ma&s;ter; which obliged him to have recour&s;e to his wits, for he went into the adjacent wood, and returning, whi&s;pered into
<PB N="209" REF="219">
the rein-deers ears three or four times, &s;o that at la&s;t they went on, but not &s;o fa&s;t as before.</P>
<P>The women al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t the men in fi&s;hing; for, be&s;ides angling and dragging, they kill a great deal of fi&s;h in the winter, by thru&s;ting their nets under the ice, which they do, by making holes in it above and introdu|cing a &s;tick; and then by &s;tamping upon the ice, they frighten the fi&s;h into the net.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of the Amu&s;ements, Marriages, Language, &amp;c. of the the Laplanders.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the Laplanders are naturally inclined to idlene&s;s, I have already &s;hewn. Let us then &s;ee how they di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves in their idle hours. Their mo&s;t general way is in vi&s;iting and talking, for as they lead a &s;olitary life, each family living &s;eparate in it's own hut, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from one another, they delight much in mutual conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>At public meetings during their a&s;&s;izes and fairs, which are chiefly in the winter &s;ea&s;on, they have &s;ome &s;ports peculiar to the men, and others for the diver&s;ion
<PB N="210" REF="220">
of both &s;exes. The men frequently try their &s;kill in jumping over a line tied up at certain heights, and over ditches and rivulets, and al&s;o at &s;hooting with a bow and arrow, and wre&s;tling; and the women as well as men, frequently play at a kind of trap-ball; cards al&s;o make a part of their amu&s;ements, and their games are tho&s;e common to all Europe.</P>
<P>The&s;e are their &s;portive tran&s;actions; among their &s;olemn ones, their marriages claim our fir&s;t attention. He who intends to marry, looks out for a maid well-&s;tocked with rein-deer; for it is the cu&s;tom in Lapland, for parents to pre&s;ent their children, as &s;oon as born, with one or more rein-deer, and &s;o again when they cut their fir&s;t tooth, which for ever after, with all their encrea&s;e, belong not to the parents, but to tho&s;e chil|dren they were given to; &s;o that by the time a girl is 18 or 20 years old, with good luck, &s;he will be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of a numerous herd. Now the more rein-deer a young woman has, the &s;ooner may &s;he hope for a woer or a hu&s;band; a Laplander's attention, as in this coun|try, being more drawn by a woman's fortune, than her per&s;on. The poorer cla&s;s of people are contented to marry the daughter of a man, who lives in a convenient place for hunting and fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>When a Laplander has looked out for a wife, which is commonly done at their public meetings, at fairs, or when they pay their tribute to the &s;tate, he takes a
<PB N="211" REF="221">
journey to her father, accompanied by his own father, (if alive,) if not, by two or three per&s;ons whom he thinks will be be&s;t received, and be mo&s;t likely to in|tercede in his behalf. When they reach the end of their journey, they are all invited to come in, except the &s;uitor, who &s;tays without, pa&s;&s;ing his time in &s;ome trifling employ, till he is al&s;o invited in; for, without an expre&s;s invitation, it is con&s;idered as rude for him to enter with the re&s;t. After they have rai&s;ed their &s;pi|rits with brandy, which they bring with them, as a pre|&s;ent, and call "the wine of good &s;ucce&s;s," the young man's friends enter on their bu&s;ine&s;s, and the &s;poke&s;man &s;olicits the maid's father's con&s;ent, and that he may not be wanting in re&s;pect, he addre&s;&s;es him as if he was a prince, calling him,
<Q>Grand&s;ire, venerable father, be&s;t and greate&s;t of fathers,</Q>
bending his knee at every word he &s;peaks: if they were acquainted with the title of Maje&s;ty, they would give him that among&s;t the re&s;t. During this application, the young woman is &s;ent out of the way. If the young man is admitted to addre&s;s his mi&s;tre&s;s, he goes immediately out of the hut to his &s;ledge, puts on his &s;unday's apparel, and &s;he being called in, he is &s;uffered to &s;alute her, which is done not only by pre&s;&s;ing their lips, but their no&s;es together. After the &s;alute, he pre&s;ents her with &s;ome of the be&s;t dainties the country affords, which he takes out of his bo&s;om, as a rein-deer's tongue, the fle&s;h of a beaver and the like, which &s;he, in the pre&s;ence of others, re|fu&s;es to accept; but, being &s;ecretly called out, they
<PB N="212" REF="222">
are again offered, and if accepted, the &s;uitor reque&s;ts leave to &s;leep near her in the hut, which if granted, the marriage is as good as concluded; if &s;he rejects his propo&s;als, &s;he throws the pre&s;ents at his feet. But frequently, notwith&s;tanding her and her father's con|&s;ent, the marriage is deferred for a long time, &s;ome|times two or three years; for the young man is obliged to get the con&s;ent, of all her kindred and relations, which is generally not done, but by pre&s;ents. In the mean time, however, he vi&s;its his intended bride occa|&s;ionally, and on his way diverts him&s;elf with &s;ome amorous &s;ong, of one of which the following is a tran&s;lation.</P>

But, &s;hould every thing &s;ucceed according to expectation, the wed|ding-day
<PB N="214" REF="224">
is appointed. The day preceding it, all the young couple's relations meet at the bride's hut, where the bridegroom makes his marriage offerings, accord|ing to agreement; to the bride's father perhaps, a &s;ilver drinking-cup, a bra&s;s kettle, with a bed and bedding: to the mother, a &s;ilver girdle, a long robe, and a tippet or collar embroidered with &s;ilver: to the brothers, &s;i&s;ters and other relations, &s;ilver &s;poons, &s;il|ver plates and &s;uch like. The next day the marriage ceremony is performed at church, by the mini&s;ter, and followed by a fea&s;t. The bride and bridegroom ap|pear in their be&s;t apparel; the bride with a coronet on her head, golden chains about her neck, and rings on her fingers; the bridegroom clothed in fine cloth, with a &s;ilver girdle round his middle. The fir&s;t thing the bride does is to unloo&s;en her hair, and give the &s;tring to the maiden who is next of kin to her; they then bind her hair with a &s;ilver fillet, in imitation of a co|ronet. As they enter the church, the bridegroom is conducted in by the men, and before the bride, &s;ome virgins lead the way; next comes the bride, led or rather dragged along by a man and a woman, and with a melancholy countenance, as if reluctant to enter into the &s;tate of matrimony. They are married after the Lutheran ceremonial, and when &s;he is to &s;ay <HI>yes,</HI> as a token of mode&s;ty and cha&s;tity, it is with &s;o low a voice, as &s;carce to be heard, even by the prie&s;t. When the ceremony is over, they return to the bride's hut, where they are entertained, and where each of the
<PB N="215" REF="225">
gue&s;ts brings his &s;hare of the provi&s;ions. If the hut will not contain the whole company, the boys and girls climb up to the top of it, and by &s;trings let down within, with hooks at the end, draw up their proportion of the fea&s;t. When the wedding is over, the new-mar|ried man is not at liberty to remove his wife and goods immediately, but is obliged to &s;erve his father-in-law for a whole year after; at the expiration of this time, he may, if plea&s;es, &s;et up for him&s;elf, when her father not only gives her the rein-deer, which he be&s;towed on her in her infancy, with all their increa&s;e, to the num|ber &s;ometimes of 100, but al&s;o all &s;orts of hou&s;hold furniture, and a number of rein-deer more: as do all the re&s;t of her relations.</P>
<P>They are very ambitious of having a numerous fa|mily, but &s;eldom have more than &s;even or eight chil|dren. As &s;oon as a woman is delivered of a child, &s;he takes a large draught of whale's-fat, which is procured from Norway, and which is as rank as train-oil; the infant is fir&s;t wa&s;hed with &s;now-water, and immediately after, when it can &s;carce draw breath, it is plunged up to the neck in warm water. There are women of &s;o &s;trong a con&s;titution, as not to keep at home after lying-in, more than four or five days. Though the churches are very thinly &s;cattered throughout this country, &s;ome|times at the di&s;tance of two or three hundred miles from each other, yet the Laplanders will carry their children, when but fourteen days old, all this way to be baptized, through wide mar&s;hes, thick fore&s;ts, and
<PB N="216" REF="226">
acro&s;s the highe&s;t mountains. In winter-time they carry them in &s;ledges, in the &s;ummer, on a pack-&s;addle, over which the cradle, with a child enclo&s;ed, is hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g, but, though the women are able to travel in fourteen days af|ter delivery, they do not cohabit again with their hu&s;bands till after the end of &s;ix weeks. Their cradles are made out of one piece of wood, hollowed like a &s;mall boat, covered with leather, and lined with mo&s;s, in which the infant is tied naked; and, when they take it out, they wrap it up in &s;oft warm &s;kins, with the hair on. When the women travel on &s;oon, they &s;ling the cradle, child and all, upon their backs, like a knap-&s;ack. Children here grow very &s;low, and are in&s;tructed by their parents, in all that is nece&s;&s;ary for them to know, for there are no ma&s;ters. The boys are daily taught and very early, to &s;hoot at a mark, and when they have been. ny time accu&s;tomed to it, are not &s;uffered to eat, till they have hit it. And the Laplanders are &s;o expert at this exerci&s;e, that they will hit an object of a quarter of an inch in diameter, at a di&s;tance, as far as they can &s;ee. As a provi&s;ion for the girls, their fa|thers give each of them, as I have before ob&s;erved, a rein-deer or two, at their birth, another at the fir&s;t tooth they cut, and &s;ometimes again others, at other periods. The&s;e with all their increa&s;e, is the property of the child to whom it is given, and if they are at any time exchanged for money or other things, it is laid by for the child's u&s;e, and &s;hould the parent die, guar|dians are appointed to look after it.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="227">Notwith&s;tanding the Laplanders undergo a great deal of hard&s;hip, yet they enjoy a great &s;hare of health. They &s;carce know what &s;ickne&s;s is, nor even tho&s;e epi|demical di&s;tempers, which &s;ometimes afflict whole countries. There is no &s;uch thing in Lapland, as the plague, putrid or inflammatory fevers. Nay, &s;hould infection be carried there, it would lo&s;e its virulency. The only general di&s;order among them is &s;ore eyes, which is often the forerunner of blindne&s;s, attributed to their con&s;tant &s;itting in &s;moky huts. The moun|taneers are often blind, owing to the continual glare of the &s;now on the mountain &s;ides. They are &s;ometimes however, afflicted with the pleuri&s;y, inflammation of the lungs, pains in the back, and giddine&s;s in the head; and, as they are &s;ubject to few di&s;orders, they are &s;trangers to phy&s;icians, and the u&s;e of tho&s;e medicines with which we are acquainted, having recour&s;e only to &s;uch remedies as old women pre&s;cribe. They live fre|quently to a great age, to 80, 90 and 100 years, and are able at this time of life, to traver&s;e the highe&s;t mountains, and mo&s;t impenetrable fore&s;ts. So that whenever they die, it is generally more from years than di&s;tempers. When any one is dangerou&s;ly ill, the drum is con&s;ulted, to know whether he will live or die. If he dies, let the di&s;order be what it will, the hut where the corp&s;e lies is for&s;aken, till they proceed to bury it. If a poor man, the body is wrapped up in an old piece of woollen cloth; if rich, in linen, and put into a coffin made of the trunk of a tree, hollowed
<PB N="218" REF="228">
out, oy a per&s;on hired for that purpo&s;e, and who, till the corp&s;e is buried, wears a bra&s;s-ring tied to his right-arm, as a pre&s;ervative again&s;t the harm which the <HI>manes</HI> of the decea&s;ed might otherwi&s;e do him. Tho&s;e who live at a great di&s;tance from a church, bury their dead in their &s;ledges, in the fir&s;t convenient place, and &s;uch as are le&s;s religious, put into the &s;ledge with them, a hatchet, flint and &s;teel, conceiving, that as they are to wander through dark, places, they will have occa&s;ion for light, and al&s;o a hatchet to open them&s;elves, through the woods, a way to heaven. But &s;uch as have been taught to believe in future judgment, bury them in, and near the churches, and &s;o de&s;picable do they hold the office of a grave-digger, that no Lap|lander, worth any thing, will undertake it. They ge|nerally employ a Swede, where they can get one, and if not, &s;ome very poor Laplander. The body of the decea&s;ed is buried, according to the rites of the Lu|theran church, attended by mourners, not dre&s;&s;ed up as in England, in all the pride of woe, but in their wor&s;t cloaths, and when the body is in the ground, his &s;ledge and cloaths are left upon the grave, left any in|fection &s;hould remain in them. The third day after the funeral, they have a fea&s;t, where the chief di&s;h is the fle&s;h of that very rein-deer which drew the body to it's grave, and which is killed for the purpo&s;e, and eaten in memory of the decea&s;ed, by all his kindred and relations. The bones of the rein-deer are after|wards collected, and buried in a box.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="229">The French writer whom I have had occa&s;ion to mention more than once, travelled from Dani&s;h Lap|landy, to that belonging to the crown of Ru&s;&s;ia, and he tells us, that he once was pre&s;ent at a funeral in Ru&s;&s;ian Lapland. When a per&s;on there dies, &s;ays he, the corp&s;e is taken from the bear-&s;kins on which it lies, and placed by &s;ix of his mo&s;t intimate friends, in a wooden coffin, being fir&s;t wrapped up in linen, his face and hands only bare. In one hand, they put a pur&s;e with money in it to pay the porter's &s;ee, at the gate of paradi&s;e, and in the other a pa&s;s, &s;igned by a prie&s;t, to be given to St. Peter, as a certificate, that he was a good chri&s;tian, and ought to be admitted into heaven. They al&s;o put into his coffin, a barrel of brandy, and &s;ome rein-deer veni&s;on, to eat and drink on the road, having as they &s;uppo&s;e, a long journey to take. They then place the image of St. Nicolas, in&s;tead of a cru|cifix, near the coffin, and at a convenient di&s;tance from it pile up &s;ome fir-tree roots, and &s;et fire to them, weep|ing and howling plentifully, and throwing them&s;elves in|to a thou&s;and different po&s;tures, to &s;hew the extrava|gance of their real, or affected &s;orrow.</P>
<P>This St. Nicolas, is not the one who&s;e fe&s;tival they celebrate in France, but Nicolas, one of the &s;even dea|cons, mentioned in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles. They dre&s;s his image in a pilgrim's habit, in along robe, with a camail or bi&s;hop's ornament, hanging down over his
<PB N="220" REF="230">
&s;houlders, a broad girdle about his middle, and a &s;taff in his hand.</P>
<P>When this noi&s;e and ge&s;ticulation is over, they march round the corp&s;e &s;everal times in proce&s;&s;ion, a&s;king the dead man,
<Q>Why he died? If he was an|gry with his wife? If he wanted any thing? If he was hungry or a-dry? If he had lo&s;t his game at hunting? If he had bad luck in fi&s;hing? If he had not cloaths to his mind?</Q>
and the like. This done, they howl again, and limp and act like &s;o many mad|men; the prie&s;t who a&s;&s;i&s;ts at this &s;olemnity, and the mourners every now and then, &s;prinkling the corp&s;e with holy-water.</P>
<P>Of the moveable effects which a Laplander leaves behind him, according to the con&s;titution of Sweden, the brother of the decea&s;ed takes two-thirds, the &s;i&s;ter one; and, as they bury their money in the earth, to conceal it from their families, if a father dies &s;uddenly, it is &s;eldom found. Such rein-deer as have been pre|&s;ented to the children in their infancy, with all their increa&s;e, come not into the divi&s;ion. If they have any real e&s;tate, as grounds, lakes or hills, they are not di|vided among the children, but are the property of the whole family, as well brothers and &s;i&s;ters, as children, founded on the divi&s;ion of the country by Charles IX. by virtue of which each family has it's peculiar allot|ment of land, for which they pay an annual tribute.
<PB N="221" REF="231">
The money they have among them is chiefly rix-dol|lars, but they &s;eldom take any to their principal fairs, (of which there are two every year, in each Lapmark or province of Lapland, which hold two or three weeks at a time,) but deal by barter, that is, exchanging one commodity for another, unle&s;s they wi&s;h to pur|cha&s;e any thing curious or rare, when it is bought with money.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this chapter with a few words on their language. There is a great &s;imilarity between the language &s;poken in Lapland, and that in Finland, &s;o that there is little doubt, but that it originated in Fin|land, from whence the Laplanders &s;prung. Each province has a peculiar dialect, &s;o that the natives of one Lapmark, will &s;carce under&s;tand tho&s;e of another.

<P>The Laplanders have no characters of their own, but their words are written with the Roman letters, &s;uch as are u&s;ed by England and other European &s;tates. Their almanacks are indeed &s;et up in Runic characters, like tho&s;e u&s;ed in Sweden in former times.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of their Religion and Government.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lapland nation (as many others before them) was, after it had continued a long time in the darkne&s;s of pagani&s;m, enlightened with chri&s;tia|nity. They did not embrace this religion from prin|ciple and conviction, but to keep in favour with the crown of Sweden, by whom it was conquered in 1277,
<PB N="223" REF="233">
and to avoid tho&s;e penalties that were inflicted on the ob&s;tinate; but it is to Gu&s;tavus Adolphus, in 1559, and to queen Chri&s;tina, his daughter, who &s;ucceed|ing him, they owe the churches and &s;chools that were fir&s;t founded in that country. The churches, however, are but thinly &s;cattered, &s;carce more than two or three in any one Lapmark or province, and in &s;ome, not more than one. Before the clo&s;e of the 15th century, the Laplanders, were &s;o far from having any books written in their own tongue, that they did not under|&s;tand what letters or writing meant. But certain por|tions of the bible, and &s;everal religious books, are now tran&s;lated into the Lapponian language, and circulated among them, and a number of mini&s;ters are appointed by Sweden, to attend their churches, and in&s;truct the people. Nay, &s;ome of the Lapland youths have of late years applied them&s;elves with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, to the knowledge of literature, and the &s;tudy of divinity, that they have been entru&s;ted with the mini&s;terial function. When the Lutheran religion took place in Sweden, it &s;oon made it's way into Lapland, and continues there to this day; though there are &s;ome remains of popery left, &s;uch as ab&s;taining from fle&s;h, on certain days, &s;igning them|&s;elves with the cro&s;s, &amp;c. Great part of the tribute paid by the Laplanders, to the crown of Sweden, is &s;et|tled upon the clergy here, and upon their families, and has made them &s;o independent, that when they take their circuits throughout their re&s;pective di&s;tricts, as they do every year, to teach and in&s;truct tho&s;e inhabi|tants, who are a great di&s;tance from the churches, they
<PB N="224" REF="234">
are treated with great re&s;pect, veneration, and ho&s;pi|tality. They are very regular and attentive to all pious exerci&s;es, and are &s;eldom, if ever, heard to &s;wear; but with all the pains taken with them, their mini&s;ters have not been able wholly to extirpate their ancient &s;uper|&s;titions and their evil con&s;equences. Thus they be|lieve, that the world was from eternity, and will con|tinue for ever; that, when the moon is eclip&s;ed, evil &s;pirits are devouring it. Some days they call black and unlucky, and others white, and the rever&s;e. On the black days, for example, on the fea&s;ts of St. Mark, St. Catherine, St. Clement, and the fir&s;t day of Chri&s;tmas, they will never go a hunting, or do bu&s;ine&s;s of any moment, as on the&s;e days they &s;ay &s;pirits wander about, and mu&s;t be appea&s;ed by certain &s;acrifices. They are al&s;o great ob&s;ervers of omens, and make particular re|flections upon what bea&s;t they meet with fir&s;t in the morning. They do not give entire credit to what is taught them concerning the re&s;urrection of the dead, the union of the &s;oul and body, and the immortality of the &s;oul, but they believe there remains &s;omething of us after death, but know not what it is. They al|&s;o &s;hare their devotion between Chri&s;t and their ficti|tious Gods, whom they wor&s;hip at one and the &s;ame time. Among their idol deities there are three, whom they adore with more than ordinary reverence, <HI>Thor, Storjunkare,</HI> and the <HI>Sun.</HI> By <HI>Thor,</HI> is under&s;tood, thunder, or the God of thunder, who has the di&s;po&s;al of man's life and death, and the command of evil
<PB N="225" REF="235">
&s;pirits. They put the rain-bow in his hand, and &s;ay it is with this he &s;hoots the daemons. <HI>Storjunkare</HI> they con&s;ider as <HI>Thor's</HI> vice-gerent, and attribute to him the many ble&s;&s;ings of human life, it being their opi|nion, that all animals are &s;ubject to his juri&s;diction. And they wor&s;hip the <HI>Sun,</HI> as the author of procrea|tion, and the origin of light and heat. To each of the&s;e deities they pay a peculiar wor&s;hip, and offer va|rious &s;acrifices. The place where they offer up their adorations to <HI>Thor,</HI> is generally a piece of ground con|&s;ecrated for the purpo&s;e behind their huts, and within the di&s;tance of a bow-&s;hot. Here they erect a kind of &s;caffold made of boards, and re&s;ting upon feet, not un|like a large table. This is the altar on which their &s;acred images are placed, and which they &s;urround an|nually with branches of birch and pine, and &s;trew with their boughs and leaves. To their god <HI>Storjunkare,</HI> they pay their wor&s;hip at certain mountains, banks of rivers, or &s;tanding waters. The&s;e places of wor&s;hip are held &s;o &s;acred, that all women are excluded from them. The image of <HI>Thor,</HI> is &s;eldom any other than the &s;tump of a tree, &s;haped on the top, like the head of a man, into which they drive an iron nail, with a &s;mall piece of flint, to enable him to &s;trike fire. Of the <HI>Sun,</HI> they have no peculiar image; wor&s;hipping it under that of <HI>Thor,</HI> but <HI>Storjunkare</HI> is repre&s;ented by a large flint &s;tone, about a foot high, full of holes, &s;uch as they find in or near the high-ways. Their &s;acrifices are wholly performed by the men, and prior to their
<PB N="226" REF="236">
offering them, they always con&s;ult their drum, to know what kind will be mo&s;t acceptable. Their mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;acrifices are the buck, rein-deer, except to the Sun, which is always a young doe, though <HI>Spirri Nils,</HI> a native of Lapland, &s;ays, they &s;ometimes will offer up cats, dogs, lambs and hens. Every year they make a new image of their god <HI>Thor,</HI> and con&s;ecrate it by anointing it with the oil and fat of the fir&s;t &s;acrifice, and burying the body &s;acrificed. No &s;ooner does a Laplander approach the &s;acred altar, but he makes a low reverence, bare-headed and with bended knees, places his offering on the table, and fixes the horns of the rein-deer on one &s;ide; &s;o that the table &s;tands on a plat &s;urrounded with horns.</P>
<P>Such is the idolatry and &s;uper&s;titious wor&s;hip of the Lapland gods, which is continued to this day among many of the natives of that country.</P>
<P>Next is their government. Before they were called Laplanders, that is about the year 900, they were &s;ub|ject to the Swedes, as at pre&s;ent; but were governed by a king of their own, as a tributary prince. They were not conquered by the Swedes, till the latter end of the thirteenth century, when Ladi&s;laus, though un|willing to be at the expence of an expedition again&s;t a &s;et of vagabond &s;avages; yet, as he could not endure that a people, dwelling almo&s;t in the heart of his do|minions &s;hould refu&s;e obedience to his crown; he in|vited
<PB N="227" REF="237">
private per&s;ons to undertake the conque&s;t, with the pro&s;pect of great advantages. The <HI>Bikarti,</HI> their neighbours, engaged in it and &s;ucceeded. On this &s;ubject, I cannot pa&s;s over in &s;ilence, a plot laid by one of the <HI>Bikarti,</HI> for the execution of this de&s;ign, as it is recorded by Buraeus.
<Q>One of the&s;e people, having laid a &s;cheme to &s;urpri&s;e &s;ome Lapland chiefs on the road, as they were returning home from <HI>Bikarti,</HI> (the northern parts of this country being de&s;titute of inhabitants in tho&s;e days,) he lay down in the highway, through which they were obliged to pa&s;s, and ordered his wife to cover him over with &s;now. As this was in the night, and the natives of Lapland, always walk &s;ingle, one before the other, he ro&s;e unexpectedly upon them, and with his &s;word, put them all to death as they pa&s;&s;ed, one ofter the other. The darkne&s;s of the night, and their di&s;tance from each other, furthered his de&s;ign, till the la&s;t man happening to &s;tumble over &s;ome of the dead bodies, perceived his danger, and made a brave re&s;i&s;tance, but the inhabitant of <HI>Bikarti</HI> &s;e|conded by his wife, at la&s;t overcame him and &s;lew him.</Q>
The Laplanders thus bereaved of their leaders, were &s;oon brought into &s;ubjection, by the craftine&s;s of one man. From this time, Lapland be|came &s;ubject to the <HI>Bikarti,</HI> as tributaries to the crown of Sweden. Things continued thus till the reign of Gu&s;tavus I, who in 1518, took the reins into his own hands, and &s;ent governors into Lapland of his own ap|pointment,

and it continued thus till the reign of Charles IX. when the government of that country was reduced to it's pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>The Laplanders are governed by the Swedi&s;h laws, and have now, under their king, a provincial judge, a &s;enator of Sweden, called by them <HI>Lagman,</HI> and his deputy called <HI>under-Lagman.</HI> Next to them an in|terpreter of the law, and &s;everal others, who&s;e office it is to hear and determine cau&s;es, from whom there lies an appeal to the court of Sweden. But as the ca|pital crimes of theft, rapine, murder and adultery, are &s;carce known in Lapland, and no one either lends or borrows money, every one living contented on what he has, there are but few cau&s;es that give ri&s;e to tho&s;e contentions which employ &s;o many lawyers in other countries.</P>
<P>Whenever a judge gives &s;entence, either in a civil or criminal cau&s;e, it is always in pre&s;ence of a prie&s;t; from an opinion, that when a prie&s;t is by, the judge will be re&s;trained from acting unju&s;tly.</P>
<P>The tribute they pay the crown of Sweden, is either the tenth part of their rein-deer, or three rix-dollars for each deer, and a pair of &s;hoes, as carriage-money of the deer to the king's &s;tore-hou&s;es or trea&s;ury, a con&s;iderable part of which is allotted, as I ob&s;erved, for the maintenance of the clergy. Be&s;ides this, they

pay &s;omething to the king of Denmark, and the great duke of Mu&s;covy; not that they are any way &s;ubject to the&s;e princes, but in return for the many advantages they receive from their territories, having liberty to hunt and fi&s;h there.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the inhabitants of Lapland, though dwelling in a cold and icy region, that affords them few of tho&s;e comforts and conveniences which other nations boa&s;t of, are far from unhappy, or without their ble&s;&s;ings. Ba&s;ili&s;ks, &s;corpions, &s;erpents, and &s;uch-like venemous creatures, are never heard of. Thun|der and lightning &s;eldom di&s;turb their re&s;t, and when|ever it <HI>does</HI> happen, is neither violent nor of any long continuance. Earthquakes and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, which make &s;uch ravages in &s;outhern and ea&s;tern countries, are both unknown in Lapland.</P>
<P>Add to this, they dwell in their cottages, in the ut|mo&s;t &s;ecurity, free from all danger of an in&s;ulting enemy, from the dread of bombs and other murderous in&s;truments, and from the fear of being condemned to the gallies, or being carried into &s;lavery. Should they ever be attacked by any ho&s;tile power, (which never yet was done,) or from their &s;ituation, likely to occur; they have this to con&s;ole them, that without much trouble, they may avoid their fury; they have nothing to do, but to pack up their furniture, cottages and all, and with their whole family, remove them on the backs

of their rein-deer, till the danger is pa&s;t, to inacce&s;&s;i|ble woods, unknown to any but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the &s;erene winters, the mo&s;t delightful and light, &s;ummer nights, and the pure and whole&s;ome air, they enjoy, together with that prodigious plenty of fi&s;h, with which their rivers end lakes are &s;tored; the va&s;t number of wild-fowl and bea&s;ts, the produce of their woods; the plea&s;antne&s;s of many of their vallies, the richne&s;s of their &s;ilver, copper, and iron mines, the refre&s;hingne&s;s of their brooks, and the murmuring noi&s;e of their water-falls, contribute to entice a con&s;iderable number of inhabitants to this remote corner of the north.</P>

<P>RUSSIAN Lapland is about eight hundred miles in diameter, and yet contains no more than twelve hundred national families. The people are of a middling &s;tature, have a flatti&s;h face, fallen cheeks, dark-grey eyes, thin beard, brown hair, are well built,
<PB N="231" REF="241">
&s;traight, and of a yellowi&s;h complexion, occa&s;ioned by the weather, the &s;moke of their habitations, and their habitual filthine&s;s. Their manner of life renders them hardy, agile, and &s;upple, but, at the &s;ame time much inclined to lazine&s;s. They have plain common &s;en&s;e, are peaceable, obedient to their &s;uperiors, not given to theft, not fickle, chearful in company, but mi&s;tru&s;tful, cheats in commerce, proud of their con&s;titution and country, and have &s;o high a notion of it and of them|&s;elves, that when removed from the place of their na|tivity, they u&s;ually die of the <HI>No&s;talgia,</HI> or longing to return. Their women are &s;hort, complai&s;ant, cha&s;te, often well-made, and extremely nervous. It frequently happens, that a woman will faint away, or even fall into a fit of phrenzy, on a &s;park of fire flying towards her, an unexpected noi&s;e, or the &s;udden &s;ight of an uncommon object, though in it's own nature not in the lea&s;t alarming; in &s;hort, at the mo&s;t trifling things imaginable. During the&s;e fits of terror, they fight with every thing that comes in their way, and when they come to them&s;elves again, are totally ignorant of every thing that pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In familiar conver&s;ation, hearers often move their lips exactly as they do who are &s;peaking.</P>
<P>As the con&s;equence of a Ru&s;&s;ian Laplander is de|rived from his rein-deer and property; they are anxious to have large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and hence it is, that their
<PB N="232" REF="242">
di&s;putes are chiefly about inheritance; and this covet|ou&s;ne&s;s renders them deaf to the cries of the poor. As they dare not u&s;e a rein-deer that has once drawn a dead body to it's grave, the interment of a parent will often cau&s;e a long litigation among the children.</P>
<P>A Laplander often runs away to &s;ome neighbouring canton, to avoid the puni&s;hment annexed to &s;ome tri|fling offence, and this retreat is as important to him, as an European would think a flight to the Ea&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the introduction of chri&s;tianity into this country, the Laplanders have pre&s;erved the man|ners of the Nomades or &s;hepherd people, &s;o that they turn not their hands to hu&s;bandry. They are either fi&s;hers or hunters; but, are often ma&s;ters of large pro|perty in herds. Some will po&s;&s;e&s;s from 600 to 1000 rein-deer, and a great quantity of &s;ilver, in money and plate. They mark their deer on the ears, and range them into cla&s;&s;es, &s;o that they con&s;tantly know whether any one is &s;trayed away, though they cannot count &s;o great a number; tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s but a &s;mall &s;tock, give each of them a name. They ca&s;trate the males, which they mean not to keep for propagation, by cru&s;hing the te&s;ticles with their teeth. Such rein-deer grow alert, &s;trong, large, hand&s;ome and tame; the&s;e are for draught, and they are held in &s;uch e&s;timation, that when they mean to pa&s;s a compliment, they will
<PB N="233" REF="243">
call one another <HI>Ha&euml;rze Jez,</HI> that is, a gelded rein-deer. They hunt in &s;now-&s;hoes, like the Swedi&s;h Lap|landers, and travel as they do, and when they come up with large animals, as wild rein-deer, wolves, &amp;c. they frequently knock them down with heavy clubs.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of this people is like that of the Swedi&s;h Laplanders, only, that they carry about them in their pouches, pipes and tobacco, for &s;moking.</P>
<P>They carry on commerce with the Norwegians, and &s;ell and buy with money. The ballance of this trade is in favour of the Laplanders, becau&s;e they can fur|ni&s;h more &s;kins and furs, than they lay out in flour, oatmeal, clothes, knives, hatchets, and other hard|ware. Hence it is, they pay their taxes in current coin, though they are at liberty to pay them in &s;kins and furs.</P>
<P>Whenever they are inclined to eat, the head of the family &s;preads a mat <HI>(Drello)</HI> on the ground, covers it with di&s;hes, and men and women &s;quat round it. Every Ru&s;&s;ian Laplander carries about him, always, a knife, a &s;poon, and a little cup to drink out of. Each has his portion &s;eparately given him, that no one may be injured, for they are great eaters. Before and after meals they &s;ay a &s;hort prayer, and when the meal is over, &s;hake hands with each other. In their vi&s;its they al&s;o give the hand and ki&s;s, &s;aying <HI>Bueri&s;s</HI> or

After dinner, they introduce fruit and tobacco; when they &s;moke, they &s;pit in their hand and &s;nuff the &s;pittle up their no&s;e. On paying a vi&s;it to a per&s;on of di&s;tinction, they carry him pre&s;ents, and give the name of <HI>Bouorazt,</HI> to whom they wi&s;h well to.</P>
<P>The Laplanders do not u&s;e the hot-bath &s;o univer&s;al in Ru&s;&s;ia, but every &s;aturday, which is with them the holie&s;t day in the week, both &s;exes bathe in rivers to|gether.</P>
<P>All the money which they have not immediate oc|ca&s;ion for, they bury in the earth, as they do their plate and other things of value, nor will, they at the point of death, &s;ay where it is hidden, conceiving they &s;hall want it in the other world. Owing to this, great part of their property is lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Many of their children die by the hard manner in which they are brought up, but tho&s;e who &s;urvive, are generally robu&s;t and alert. Living free from care, temperance and continual exerci&s;e, contribute much to their &s;trength of con&s;titution, and this is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their taking care to build their hou&s;es on an ele|vated &s;pot; yet, notwith&s;tanding all this, they &s;eldom live to an advanced age.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="249">The common di&s;ea&s;es of the country, are the itch, the phthi&s;ic, and putrid fevers, be&s;ides inflammations of the eyes, general in all places where the habitations are &s;moky. The venereal di&s;ea&s;e is unknown here. Their remedies are chiefly idle charms, and &s;uper&s;titi|ous ceremonies. In wounds, however, they apply tur|pentine, and for the itch, they bathe in water in which birch-bark has been infu&s;ed. In internal di&s;orders, they drink the fre&s;h blood of a wild rein-deer. If they feel any external pain, their u&s;ual remedy is fire; they light mu&s;hrooms prepared like touch-wood, and burn it on the part affected, till the &s;kin cracks and bur&s;ts.</P>

<P>The Laplanders of Mu&s;covy, and tho&s;e of Norway, are equally &s;uper&s;titious and fertile in apparitions and childi&s;h tales. They never mention the bear by his name, but call him "the old one with the fur cloak." They imagine al&s;o, that their magicians have the power of controuling the winds and the rain, of producing and de&s;troying in&s;ects, of &s;peaking to &s;pirits, and a

thou&s;and other fooleries. But they believe at the &s;ame time, that thunder is inimical to magicians, and hence this proverb,
<Q>If it was not for thunder, the world would be de&s;troyed by magic.</Q></P>

<P>BY Norway, is under&s;tood the northern way. It is bounded on the &s;outh, by the entrance into the Baltic &s;ea, called the Scaggerac or Categate, on the we&s;t and north, by the northern ocean, and is di|vided from Sweden on the ea&s;t, by a long ridge of mountains. It lies between 58 and 71 and half de|grees north latitude, and is, according to the be&s;t e&s;ti|mation,
<PB N="238" REF="253">
in a direct line through the air, 202 Norway miles, or about 1010 Engli&s;h long, and it's breadth from the frontiers of Sweden, towards the northern ocean, about the 63d. degree, is about 65 Norway miles, or 325 Engli&s;h; from thence, the country be|comes gradually narrower towards the north, in the frigid zone, where Norwegian Lapland or Finmark is &s;ituated; but, as this part of Norway is &s;ufficiently de&s;cribed in our <HI>Account</HI> of <HI>Lapland,</HI> we mu&s;t refer our readers to that, for a knowledge of this part of the country, our de&s;ign here being only to &s;peak of Nor|way, from the 69th degree &s;outhward.</P>
<P>The air, light, warmth, &amp;c. varies much more in Norway, than in mo&s;t European countries, according to it's extent and expo&s;ure to the &s;ea. In the begin|ning of the year, the day-light encrea&s;es rapidly, and decrea&s;es at the approach of winter, in the &s;ame pro|portion. In the middle of February, &s;ays Pontoppidan, I have been able to read without difficulty, at &s;ix in the morning, which, at the &s;ame hour, in October was not po&s;&s;ible. In &s;ummer-nights, the horizon, when unclouded, is &s;o clear and luminous, that, at midnight, one may read, write, and do every kind of work, as in the day. Chri&s;tian V. during his &s;tay at Drontheim, (which is in 65 degrees, 20 minutes, north;) in June, 1685, u&s;ed to &s;up at midnight, without the u&s;e of lights. In the di&s;trict of Trom&s;en, which is properly the extremity of Norway, towards the Finmark i&s;lands,

about the 68th degree; the &s;un is continually in view in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, and in the depth of winter, it is invi&s;ible for &s;ome weeks; and all the light perceived at noon, is a faint glimmering, of about an hour and a half's continuance, which, as the &s;un never appears above the horizon, chiefly proceeds from the reflection of the rays on the highe&s;t mountains, the &s;ummits of which are &s;een more clearly, than other objects. But this is not the only light there is; be|&s;ides the moon-&s;hine, which by reflection of the mountains, is exceedingly bright in the vallies and creeks, &s;o that the fi&s;hermen are well able to follow their employ; at times, when their day-light is con|tracted to &s;ix hours, the <HI>Aurora Borealis,</HI> or northern lights, enables them to continue their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The degrees of heat and cold, are in Norway vari|ous beyond conception, and not only from the annual vici&s;&s;itudes of the &s;ea&s;ons, but in the very &s;ame &s;ea|&s;on, and on the &s;ame day. In mo&s;t of the provinces, the winter's cold generally &s;ets in about the middle of October, la&s;ting till the middle of April, when the waters are continually frozen to a great thickne&s;s, and the mountains covered with &s;now: the inten&s;ene&s;s of the cold is &s;o great, that in January and February, the large&s;t rivers, with their roaring cataracts, are arre&s;ted in their cour&s;e by the fro&s;t, and the very &s;pittle, is no &s;ooner out of the mouth, than it is congealed and rolls along the ground like hail, and no &s;ooner has a hor&s;e

dropped his dung on the ice, than it moves and leaps about, owing to the &s;udden change from heat to cold, which occa&s;ions a violent conflict, when the &s;harp and den&s;e air penetrates forcibly into the lighter, and ex|pells it.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e great caution in &s;uch weather, in which an unexperienced and unguarded traveller, may be deprived of his no&s;e and ears. The natives cover their faces with a piece of gauze, and &s;ome rub their faces with &s;now; but, in long journeys over the highe&s;t mountains, where the air is much keener, and the winter quite in&s;upportable; no precautions will avail, without the convenience of mountain-&s;toves, or hou&s;es with fire in them, which are kept at the public charge, for the repo&s;e and warmth of travellers. Of the impracticability of travelling over the&s;e moun|tains in the winter months, the Swedi&s;h hi&s;tory affords a melancholy in&s;tance. In February 1719, &s;even (&s;ome &s;ay nine) thou&s;and Swedi&s;h &s;oldiers, with their officers, peri&s;hed on the mountain of Ruden or Tydal, which &s;eparates Jempteland in Sweden, from the dio|ce&s;e of Drontheim, without any other enemy than the extreme cold, which &s;urprized them on the ridge of that mountain, where no one could come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In the autumn of the preceding year, in a war be|tween the Danes and Swedes, this corps, which then
<PB N="241" REF="256">
con&s;i&s;ted of ten thou&s;and men, had penetrated into the country, and appeared to have a de&s;ign upon Dron|theim, to clear a pa&s;&s;age for the main army; but the Dani&s;h general Budd&eacute;, made &s;uch good di&s;po&s;iti|ons again&s;t the enemy, that they laid a&s;ide their de|&s;ign of attacking Drontheim, and cantoned them&s;elves among the Norway pea&s;ants; advice however &s;oon after coming, that Count Sponeck, was in full march towards them, they had orders to make the mo&s;t precipitate retreat over tho&s;e de&s;art and lofty moun|tains; but, ju&s;t as they had reached the frontiers of their own country, they were overtaken by a &s;torm, accompanied with an extreme cold and much &s;now, which &s;o bewildered them, that the greate&s;t part of them peri&s;hed. A company of 200 Norwegian &s;ledge|men, under Major Emahus, which followed them clo&s;e to ob&s;erve their retreat, found the enemy dead upon the mountains, &s;ome &s;itting, &s;ome lying, and &s;ome in a po&s;ture of prayer, all frozen to death. How great mu&s;t have been their di&s;tre&s;s, may be judged from their cutting their mu&s;quets to pieces, in order to burn their &s;tocks. Generals Labarre and Zoega, were among the dead, but Generals Alderfield and Horn, barely e&s;caped with their lives; and, of the whole body, only 2,500, or according to others, no more than 500, &s;urvived this dreadful cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>But the &s;everity and inconvenience of this cold, it has plea&s;ed the Creator to temp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r with &s;ome advan|tages,

and a greater variety of pre&s;ervatives again&s;t it, than other countries afford. This fro&s;t and &s;now fa|cilitates the conveyance of goods by land; for without it, they can neither convey the timber they have felled, to the water, nor carry their goods to market in their &s;ledges. The country abounds in large fore&s;ts, afford|ing them plenty of fuel and timber, for building. The wool of the &s;heep, and the furs and &s;kins of wild-bea&s;ts, furni&s;h them with warm linings for their clothes, and good bed-covering. The innumerable flights of wild-fowls, &s;upply them with down and feathers; the mountains them&s;elves &s;erve for fences and retreats; and above all, it is to be ob&s;erved, that even the cold air occa&s;ions warmth in the human body, by rendering it more firm and compact, and fortifying it again&s;t ex|ternal injuries. Thus is the natural warmth, by the clo&s;ene&s;s of the pores, repelled towards the inner, vital parts, particularly the &s;tomach, &s;o, that the northern people are known to dige&s;t &s;moked-fle&s;h, dried fi&s;h and and other food hard of dige&s;tion, better than any other nations. In &s;hort, I may venture to affirm, &s;ays <HI>Pon|toppidan,</HI> that were the Norwegians tempted by any thing to change countries with the Italians, the winter's cold would not be their motive, for this is the lea&s;t of their complaints, and for my part &s;ays he, (&s;peaking of Bergen, which lies in the 61&s;t. degree of latitude) I cannot &s;ay, that the cold here has ever been more painful to me, than in other parts.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="258">We mu&s;t here al&s;o mention a wonderful in&s;tance of divine oeconomy, re&s;pecting the weather, which we &s;hould he&s;itate to commit to writing, did not thou&s;ands of witne&s;&s;es confirm it. When the winter rages with &s;uch &s;everity in the ea&s;t parts of Norway, that all the fre&s;h waters are frozen, the lakes and bays are open on the we&s;t &s;ide, though lying in a direct line with the ea&s;tern parts; the air is mi&s;ty and cloudy, and the fro&s;ts are &s;eldom known to la&s;t a fortnight or three weeks. In the centre of Germany, which is 200 leagues more to the &s;outh, the winters are generally more &s;e|vere, and the fro&s;ts &s;harper than in the dioce&s;e of Ber|gen, which extends to the 63d. degree north, where the inhabitants wonder to read in the public papers of fro&s;t and &s;now in Poland and Germany, at a time, when no &s;uch weather is felt here. The harbours of Am&s;terdam, Hamburg, Copenhagen, and L&uuml;beck, are frozen ten times oftener than ours; for with us, it is generally known not to happen two or three times in a whole century, and what is yet more extraordinary, when the harbour of Bergen is frozen, the Seine at Pa|ris, may be concluded to be in the &s;ame condition. Thus is our winter at Bergen &s;o very moderate, that the &s;eas are always open to fi&s;hermen and mariners; and, it is &s;eldom that the bays and creeks are frozen over, except tho&s;e that reach far up the country, where they meet with keen and dry north-ea&s;t winds, blowing from the land. As far as the 80th. or 82d. degree, the north-&s;ea continues open and navigable, both win|ter

and &s;ummer, except in the creeks, and along the &s;hores in Finmark, Iceland, and Greenland, from whence the large ma&s;&s;es of ice being detached, are &s;een to float in the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The amazing difference of weather in the &s;ame lati|tude, which ari&s;es from natural cau&s;es, is according to the wi&s;e de&s;ign of the Creator, requi&s;ite for the well-being of the country; for the ea&s;tern parts require a hard winter for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of their inhabitants, to enable them to carry their goods a great way to mar|ket, and take back nece&s;&s;aries; whereas mild and open weather is no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to the we&s;tern parts, where the inhabitants chiefly maintain them&s;elves by their &s;ea-fi&s;heries. It is expedient for them that the &s;ea &s;hould be open during the whole winter, for, from the middle of January, herrings, &s;cates, cods, &amp;c. are cha&s;ed by the whales towards the coa&s;ts, when pea&s;ants &s;ally out in multitudes from the creeks into the &s;ea, and thus procure a great part of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance for the whole year, and &s;everal thou&s;ands of the northern pea&s;ants of both &s;exes, during the months of January and February, pa&s;s the whole day upon the open &s;ea, and only towards the approach of night betake them|&s;elves to their huts, in the neighbouring i&s;lands. The mildne&s;s of the winter, is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for curing and &s;alting the fi&s;h, which in fro&s;ty weather would be &s;poiled and u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="260">After this account of the cold in Norway, it is pro|per to &s;ay &s;omething of the heat. In the &s;ummer months it is not only warm, but hot to &s;uch a degree, from the reflection of the mountains and other cau&s;es, that per&s;ons who have been born and brought up in &s;ultry climates, might fancy them&s;elves &s;uddenly tran&s;|ported home. But the&s;e heats are of &s;hort duration; were they of longer continuance, they would bring grapes, and other fruits and vegetables, to the like ex|qui&s;ite perfection, as in other countries.</P>
<P>There cannot be a more deci&s;ive proof of the &s;um|mer's heat in Norway, than that &s;everal vegetables, and particularly barley, grow up and ripen, within &s;ix weeks or two months. It is certain, that where nature has but a &s;hort time to work, &s;he accelerates her operations, and acts with greater energy. In our northern gardens, it is indeed &s;eldom that the winter fruits can attain to their proper maturity, but tho&s;e of the &s;ummer, keep pace with the fruits of Denmark, where &s;trawberries, cherries and the like are ripe, &s;o early as the fir&s;t of July.</P>
<P>From the&s;e in&s;tances, it is but candour to admit, that however natural and la&s;ting the cold may be in Norway, yet the impartial Sovereign of Nature has not &s;o far neglected the inhabitants, but they may pa&s;s their days agreeably; e&s;pecially, when the &s;alubrity of the air is con&s;idered. In the middle of the country,
<PB N="246" REF="261">
particularly about the mountains, the inhabitants have &s;carcely an idea of &s;ickne&s;s, unle&s;s it be hereditary or contracted by intemperance. It is reported, that in the vale of Gulbrand, which is regularly vi&s;ited by very &s;alubrious gales, e&s;pecially in the pari&s;h of Lae&s;&s;oe, there are per&s;ons of &s;uch an extreme age, that from a wearine&s;s of life, they get them&s;elves removed el&s;e|where, in order to die the &s;ooner; that, farther, in the province of Valders, and in other parts, meal may be kept many years without any damage; a proof of the purity and dryne&s;s of the air. From this whole|&s;omene&s;s of the weather, medicine is very little under|&s;tood, and practitioners in phy&s;ic meet with very few patients, whil&s;t lawyers are never at a lo&s;s for clients.</P>
<P>It is only in the chief towns that phy&s;icians are to be met with, where they are e&s;tabli&s;hed, as provincial practitioners, with a public &s;alary; and, notwith&s;tand|ing this, have but little employ. In the populous city of Bergen, where there are 30,000 people, there are but two phy&s;icians, and the&s;e two are &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>There is a great deal of rain in Norway, occa&s;ioned by the clouds pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t the mountains, and the&s;e frequent &s;howers are of great u&s;e to vegetables; for in a rocky &s;oil, where the earth lies very &s;hallow, was it not for this con&s;tant humidity, the crops would be burnt up. In the vale of Guldbrand, and other parts where the mountains are not &s;teep and general, and of
<PB N="247" REF="262">
cour&s;e the rains not &s;o frequent, water is conveyed into the fields by trenches, and thrown upon the cul|tivated lands by &s;coops, as is practi&s;ed in Per&s;ia, and other hot countries. The great mountain of File|field, makes a very remarkable difference in the wea|ther between it's two &s;ides; when it is fine weather on the ea&s;tern &s;ide, it &s;hall not be &s;o on the we&s;tern, &amp; <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;,</HI> for the cour&s;e of air, when impelled again&s;t the highe&s;t mountains is checked, &s;eldom a&s;cending high enough to pa&s;s over them. And this is not un|common in other mountainous countries, for we are informed, in <HI>Paul Van Caarden's</HI> voyage to the Ea&s;t-Indies, that whil&s;t the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on la&s;ts, from cape Cormarin, to the coa&s;t of Coromandel, it is winter during that time, from Diu to the afore&s;aid cape. In like manner, on one &s;ide of the mountain called Gates, or Ballagates, the fields are cloathed in their verdure, and the country appears in all the gaiety and luxuri|ancy of &s;ummer, whil&s;t on the other, it is covered with fogs and rain.</P>
<P>In the northern and ea&s;tern parts of Norway, the &s;nows are very thick, and lie long on the ground; but, in this re&s;pect, are very beneficial to the pea&s;ants, enabling them, as we ob&s;erved before, to tran&s;port their commodities to di&s;tant markets. In travelling over the &s;now, they make u&s;e of <HI>Truviers,</HI> (a kind of &s;now-&s;hoes, broad and round, made of withies, keep|ing the feet from &s;inking in the &s;now,) and &s;ometimes
<PB N="248" REF="263">
they are obliged to cover their hor&s;es feet with the &s;ame. They have another contrivance for travelling on the &s;now, which are long and thin pieces of board, fixed to the feet, &s;o &s;mooth, that the pea&s;ants will &s;lide with them over the &s;now, with the expedition of &s;hips under full &s;ail. The&s;e are the &s;cates which the Lap|landers u&s;e, and which we de&s;cribed in our account of that country. They are here called <HI>Skies.</HI> In time of war, a corps of four or &s;ix hundred of the&s;e &s;kie-men are very &s;erviceable as light troops, for reconnoitring, procuring intelligence, or for any &s;udden enterprize; no place being inacce&s;&s;ible to them, and they being always &s;ure of coming upon the enemy by &s;urprize. Though the &s;now has it's advantages, it has al&s;o it's inconveniences; among the&s;e, the greate&s;t is the <HI>Snee-fond,</HI> that is, when a ma&s;s of &s;now, falling from a mountain top, &s;hall overwhelm both men and cattle, and demoli&s;h hou&s;es. A century or two ago, (for the preci&s;e time is not certainly known,) a whole pari&s;h, &s;ituate between Quindherret and Hardanger, was wholly covered by a &s;now-fall, and &s;o remains to this day; the &s;now, which had fallen from the adjacent mountains, not di&s;&s;olving the year after, was gradually increa&s;ed and hardened by lying, the &s;ituation being high, and hemmed in among the mountains, &s;omething like the famous Eis-blinc, in Greenland, of which we have given a de&s;cription and plate, in our account of
<PB N="249" REF="264">
that country. Many lives were lo&s;t in that di&s;a&s;ter, of which no memorial would remain, were not the truth of the &s;tory, which was at fir&s;t much doubted, &s;till confirmed by &s;everal uten&s;ils, &s;uch as &s;ci&s;&s;ars, knives, ba&s;ons, &amp;c. brought to light by a rivulet, which runs under the &s;now; an inconte&s;tible evidence, that this &s;pot was formerly clear of &s;now, and inhabited. Ex|perience &s;ilences all cavils on this head, the &s;now being known, by age, to become &s;o firm and indurated, that a hor&s;e's &s;hoe makes no impre&s;&s;ion on it; and, as it yields very gradually to the &s;un, it is thus &s;paringly di&s;pen&s;ed for the daily benefit of the inhabitants in the vales, ex|cept in a damp &s;outherly wind, which penetrating the &s;now, the mountains pore down whole torrents. The&s;e accumulated &s;nows thus become con&s;tant &s;prings for promoting vegetation in the open grounds below, and when the&s;e &s;prings are too early exhau&s;ted, the gra&s;s and corn inevitably &s;uffer, and are &s;ometimes withered for want of moi&s;ture. The&s;e currents, likewi&s;e, by their impetuous de&s;cent, drive great numbers of little mills, every farm-hou&s;e having it's own mill. Ano|ther advantage ari&s;ing from the&s;e &s;nows, is, that cattle which, in &s;ummer-time, are turned out upon the mountains for pa&s;ture, are &s;o extremely tormented with heat, mu&s;ketoes and gnats, that they run about regardle&s;s of danger, and in this frenzy, many have lo&s;t their lives, falling down the precipices; which lays the pea&s;ants under a nece&s;&s;ity, where no &s;now is near, of erecting &s;heltering places for the cattle; but
<PB N="250" REF="265">
if any &s;now-hill be in &s;ight, the cattle move towards it, knowing that they &s;hall there be relieved, by the coolne&s;s which it communicates to the air. A fur|ther remarkable in&s;tance of divine goodne&s;s in this ca&s;e is, that ju&s;t as far as the &s;now melts, and runs from the mountains, the very be&s;t gra&s;s is ob&s;erved to grow, and in the greate&s;t plenty.</P>
<P>The wind in this country is generally &s;outherly; &s;eldom directly we&s;t, but &s;ometimes &s;outh-we&s;t or &s;outh-ea&s;t; a north, north-we&s;t, and particularly a north north-ea&s;t wind, are little known here, but when they do blow, they verify the words of Solomon. "The north-wind driveth away rain." Ea&s;t-winds are here temperate, and bring dry weather, whereas, &s;outh-winds bring rain. The inhabitants of the large province of Nord-land, who, in not le&s;s than 200 barks vi&s;it Bergen every year, at the fair and a&s;&s;izes, and mo&s;t of whom have a hundred leagues to &s;ail, are often favoured with north and &s;outh-winds, like regu|lar trade-winds, though not &s;o infallibly to be de|pended on.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e regular winds, the coa&s;t is &s;ubject to water-&s;pouts, and al&s;o to <HI>Field-flagers,</HI> or mountain-&s;qualls, that is, gu&s;ts from the land; by which, with|out the utmo&s;t precaution, a ve&s;&s;el is &s;uddenly lo&s;t, in the &s;ecurity of fine and calm weather. But the real hurricanes or whirlwinds, are known to be extremely
<PB N="251" REF="266">
dangerous to &s;hips, by their &s;udden and rapid vortexes, which throw the &s;ea at a &s;mall di&s;tance into &s;uch an agitation, that the water in drops flies up into the air like &s;moke. The common people from an old &s;u|per&s;tition, call them <HI>Gan&s;kud,</HI> conceiting, that a ne|cromancer of Fin-Lapland, has then &s;ent out his Ganfly, to do mi&s;chief. The&s;e are &s;mall flies which the Lap|land magicians pre&s;erve to deceive the people in this particular, and which the reader may find a further ac|count in our de&s;cription of that country.</P>
<P>As the mountains of Norway con&s;i&s;t, in general, of rocks intermixed with quarries of marble, free-&s;tone, &s;late, &amp;c. which towards the &s;ea are almo&s;t &s;tripped of earth, by the force of the winds, and further up in the country, are covered indeed with earth, but not more than a few yards deep, and often le&s;s; one would be apt to think, that below this &s;lender covering, the whole kingdom of Norway is but one &s;olid &s;tone, only of a different nature, figure and height. But the error of &s;uch a conclu&s;ion is evident, not only from the many deep creeks running up the country, but fre&s;h-water lakes, &s;wamps and fens, in &s;ome of which, though &s;ounded with lines of &s;everal hundred fathoms, no bottom has ever been found. And add to this, that however mountainous and craggy Norway is thought to be, yet it affords many champaign, well-cultivated tracts of land, of &s;ix, eight, or ten leagues in extent. The mountains are &s;o exten&s;ive, that to pa&s;s them, a
<PB N="252" REF="267">
man mu&s;t &s;ometimes travel 50 miles. To pa&s;s <HI>Har|danger,</HI> he mu&s;t travel 70 miles, and the rivers and cataracts which inter&s;ect the&s;e dreadful precipices, and are pa&s;&s;able only by &s;light tottering wooden bridges, render travelling in this country very terrible and dangerous.</P>
<P>Swamps and mar&s;hes lie both on the ridges of the mountains, and in the vallies, at the foot of the &s;teepe&s;t precipices; the&s;e, in many places, render the ways very un&s;afe, being pa&s;&s;ible only in the drie&s;t &s;um|mer months, and &s;ometimes not even then; unle&s;s as is the ca&s;e, a kind of cau&s;eway is formed over them at the public charge, with thou&s;ands of logs and large pieces of timber laid acro&s;s the mar&s;h, which are &s;oon rotten. In the&s;e places the ground is as &s;oft as dough, yielding and moving under the foot; there being pro|bably beneath the&s;e mar&s;hes, an aby&s;s of &s;tanding water, which is thus weakly vaulted over. Near Lae&s;&s;oe, in the dioce&s;e of Chri&s;tian&s;and, this kind of timber cau&s;eway is carried on for near a mile, and if a hor&s;e, or much le&s;s animal, happens to make the lea&s;t wrong &s;tep, he &s;inks beyond recovery. The earth indeed here, as in many other countries, &s;eems to have a vegeta|tive or &s;elf-renewing power, for there are a great many peat bogs, in which bodies of large firs and pines, which the turpentine has pre&s;erved, are found, &s;ome yards under ground; which &s;hews the earth to have been gradually filled, and as it were grown up from
<PB N="253" REF="268">
a mixture of leaves, twigs, mo&s;s, reeds and the like. That entire &s;keleton of a whale, accidentally found in 1687, in Ti&s;tedale, near Frederick&s;hall, is a further proof of the &s;ame. It was found buried with earth and &s;and, 240 feet under ground.</P>
<P>To give the reader &s;ome better idea of the&s;e moun|tains, we will de&s;cribe that of Filefield to him, the height of which is upwards of two miles and a half, and the road over it by a tedious a&s;cent, through many windings, to it's &s;ummit. It's great elevation may be known from the change from heat to cold, which, as we ri&s;e it, becomes &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that the traveller may very well &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf tran&s;ported from a hot &s;ummer to a piercing winter. I cro&s;&s;ed it, &s;ays Bi&s;hop <HI>Pontoppidan,</HI> on the 28th of May, 1749, having the day before ob&s;erved the barley in the low grounds to be in great forwardne&s;s, and the heat in the narrow vallies thereabouts, &s;o &s;ultry, that at noon, I was oblig|ed to &s;helter my&s;elf in Borgen Chapel; but after a few hours progre&s;s up the mountain of Filefield, I found my&s;elf ri&s;ing as it were into the upper region of the air, towards the pure and &s;ubtle aether, and as much in the depth of winter, as if it had been new-year's day, &s;urrounded with &s;now and ice. The &s;un &s;hone bright, but with &s;o little heat, that though it was within three weeks of Mid&s;ummer, all the waters were frozen, par|ticularly the fre&s;h-water lakes there.

of my guides, that the ice would bear, for as the &s;now-water lay upon it, I apprehended it might give way; however, I got over in my &s;ledge-chai&s;e, which, as is here cu&s;tomary, was drawn by pea&s;ants and not by hor|&s;es. From the top we have a pro&s;pect to the extent of 120 miles. In cro&s;&s;ing from this mountain, we are obliged to pa&s;s a tremendous cataract which divides it, and into which an enormous piece of rock, larger than any ca&s;tle, has fallen, and by ob&s;tructing the pa&s;&s;age of the waters, cau&s;es a dreadful roar. It &s;erves, however, as a pier to &s;upport a wooden hor&s;e-bridge, from one mountain to the other. The pa&s;&s;age or high-road down the &s;ide of one eminence of the mountain, and up the &s;ide of the other, is &s;eldom more than a ledge cut out of the rock, broad enough for two hor|&s;es to pa&s;s, and often, for con&s;iderable lengths, a pa&s;|&s;age only for one: without any rails or fence, as indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible to fix any. The&s;e ways or ledges, hang on the &s;ides of perpendicular and craggy &s;teeps, of &s;tupendous height, in &s;ome places cut through the rock in arched pa&s;&s;ages, in others, the road is merely a &s;caffold three feet broad, &s;hored up with &s;tone-work, or &s;u&s;pended by iron-bolts, fa&s;tened in the mountain's &s;ide. Should it happen, as it occa&s;ionally has, that two men on hor&s;eback &s;hould meet in one of the&s;e narrow ways, where two cannot pa&s;s, and at &s;ome di&s;|tance from a wider &s;pot, &s;o that they cannot back their hor&s;es, there is no alternative, but one man's rai&s;ing him&s;elf above the head of the other, by a rope fa&s;tened

to a crag of the rock above, whil&s;t the other pu&s;hes his hor&s;e down the precipice into the water below; by which means he pa&s;&s;es, and the other lowering him&s;elf down, travels on, a-foot.</P>
<P>Over Filefield is the high po&s;t road, and the way is marked all along with po&s;ts, at two or three hundred paces di&s;tance, that in &s;nowy or dark weather, the tra|veller may not lo&s;e him&s;elf in the&s;e de&s;art wilds, where no living creature is to be met with, except here and there, a few wild rein-deer.</P>
<P>In &s;ome mea&s;ure to refre&s;h and relieve the traveller, two mountain-&s;toves or re&s;ting hou&s;es, are maintained on Filefield, at the public charge, and three on Do|frefield, and furni&s;hed with fire, light and kitchen uten|&s;ils. There is but one way of avoiding this chain of mountains, in the road from Sweden to Nordenfields; and that is in a hollow, where it &s;eems interrupted by a long and deep valley, reaching from Rom&s;dale to Gulbrand&s;dale, and this low road many prefer in their journies from the highlands to the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, or to Rom&s;dale market. It was in their march, through this long defile, that a body of 1000 Scotch, &s;ent over in 1612, as auxiliaries to the Swedes, were put to the &s;word by the pea&s;ants of Gulbrand, who never give quarter. The&s;e precipices and narrow pa&s;&s;es are the be&s;t fortifications in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="276">In many of the mountains in this country are va&s;t cavities; in that of Torghatten, in the di&s;trict of Hel|geland, which &s;tands out in the &s;ea, is a large hole quite through it, about half way up, po&s;&s;ibly through|out; 150 ells in height, and 3000 in length, through which the &s;un may be &s;een. On the top of this moun|tain is a piece of water or re&s;ervoir, the &s;ize of a mo|derate fi&s;h-pond. The rain-water which gathers there trickles down it's &s;ides, through fi&s;&s;ures and cracks.

<P>In the mountain of Dol&s;teen, there is al&s;o a won|derful cavern, &s;imilar to that in the Peak of Derby|&s;hire; it's entrance is twelve feet broad, and &s;ix feet high. No &s;ooner are you entered, but it's breadth and height increa&s;es, to the dimen&s;ions of a large church, the &s;ides of which are perpendicular, and the roof vaulted. About the middle, there is a de&s;cent, like &s;teps, which leads &s;o low, that tho&s;e who are within, hear the da&s;hing of the waters, (for it joins the &s;ea,) over their heads. There are more &s;teps that lead &s;till lower, but no one has found him&s;elf couragious enough to venture further; &s;tones have often been thrown down, and the echo of their fall has continued for a minute; but whether it fell into water or on rock, could never be di&s;tingui&s;hed. The length of this ca|vern

<P>In the di&s;trict of Evindvig, &s;ix leagues north of Bergen, in a place called Stene&s;und, is a mountain, who&s;e &s;ides, for a great height from the water, and for half a quarter of a league next the &s;ea, abound with &s;uch petrified bodies, as are &s;ought for in the cabinet of virtuo&s;os: many kinds of <HI>Cornua Hammonis,</HI> large and &s;mall &s;nakes, mu&s;cles, worms, in&s;ects, and many others. This cannot be called a <HI>Lu&s;us naturae,</HI> appear|ing as it were, to have been impre&s;&s;ed into a pa&s;te or dough, and no rational enquirer can entertain any doubt, that the rock was once as &s;oft as dough, when the&s;e bodies were intermixed with it; this, with other circum&s;tances confirms the opinion, that rocks in ge|neral were once in a &s;oft &s;tate, but petrified by time.</P>
<P>In the highlands of Norway, the villages cannot be &s;o large, compact and convenient, as in other parts; but, the hou&s;es lie &s;cattered among the vallies, gene|rally at half a quarter of a league's di&s;tance.

<P>Where a &s;heep or goat chance to make a fal&s;e &s;tep and fall into a projection, called a mountain-hammer, from whence it can neither get higher or lower, a pea|&s;ant will chearfully venture his life for it, and, de&s;cend|ing from the top of a mountain, by a rope of &s;ome hundred fathoms, will &s;ling him&s;elf on a cro&s;s-&s;tick, till he can get his foot on the place where his goat is, when he fa&s;tens it to the rope, and it is drawn up with him&s;elf.

And the&s;e natural fortifi|cations are al&s;o an ornament to the country, affording the mo&s;t delightful contra&s;ts in the diver&s;ity of it's pro&s;pects. Nature has been more profu&s;ely lavi&s;h of her favours to the &s;ituation of &s;ome farm-hou&s;es here, than to mo&s;t royal palaces in other countries, though a&s;&s;i&s;ted with all the embelli&s;hments of groves, terraces, ca&s;cades, canals, and the like. Some trading places, as Bragne&s;s, and others, are charmingly &s;ituated be|tween mountains, at the mouth of rivers; and, &s;o de|lightful is the &s;ituation of the di&s;trict of Waas, &s;ome leagues ca&s;tward of Bergen, that it has been called the northern Italy: certainly to one, who de&s;ires no more than a regular a&s;&s;emblage of the beauties of nature, (though of <HI>mere</HI> nature,) there cannot be a more en|chanting pro&s;pect; for all the buildings in it, are Wang church, the par&s;onage, and a few farm-hou&s;es &s;cattered on different eminences. But the beauty of the pro&s;pect is much heightened by two uniform mountains, gradually ri&s;ing in the &s;ame proportions, to a va&s;t height; betwixt which runs a valley, near half a league in breadth, and a river &s;ometimes &s;preading into little lakes, and &s;ometimes precipitating it&s;elf down the rocks, in foaming and &s;onorous ca&s;cades.

<P>Having &s;aid &s;o much of the land, it is proper to give &s;ome account of the waters. The coa&s;ts of Nor|way are wa&s;hed, for three hundred leagues, by a part of the north or great Atlantic &s;ea, which by very nar|row channels, forms a multitude of i&s;lands, &s;ome from three to nine leagues in length, and not barren; but mo&s;t of them &s;o &s;mall, as to be inhabited only by a few fi&s;hermen and pilots, who keep a &s;mall &s;tock of cattle, which they &s;end out for pa&s;ture to the neare&s;t little i&s;lands, rocks and &s;heers. The&s;e &s;heers are little more than large rocks, or a kind of &s;tone columns, founded in the bottom of the &s;ea, the heads or capitals of which, &s;carce ri&s;e higher than &s;ome fathoms above the waves. There are a million or more of the&s;e, and the whole we&s;tern coa&s;t of Norway is defended by them; for no naval power will dare venture within them, without a pilot of the country, and even then they are in danger from the lea&s;t &s;torm, which here gives no warning; in &s;o much, that in an in&s;tant,

unle&s;s they have the good fortune to &s;ecure them&s;elves in a &s;afe harbour, they may be da&s;hed to pieces in the creeks, which are all enclo&s;ed with &s;teep rocks. This coa&s;t, indeed, affords a great many and good harbours, which few other maritime countries can boa&s;t of. To prevent the danger, ari&s;ing from the winds and currents in the&s;e &s;traits, by order of government, many hundred of large iron rings are fixed in the rocks, more than two fathoms above water, as moorings for the &s;hips, where there is not room for them, or where is no an|chorage; for the Norway &s;hore is level, or gradually a&s;cending in a very few places, but generally &s;o &s;teep and angular, that clo&s;e to the rocks, the &s;ea is from one hundred to three hundred fathoms deep. There are &s;and-banks further off at &s;ea, from ten to fifteen fathoms deep, which are the daily rendezvous of all &s;orts of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>From the &s;ea, &s;everal large and &s;mall creeks run &s;ix, eight, or ten leagues up the country, mo&s;t of them a hundred fathoms deep on the banks, and more than four hundred in the middle, where fi&s;h are caught in great abundance. In Floge creek, about five miles from Drontheim, a line of 1000 fathoms would not reach the bottom; &s;o that the &s;ea here is thought to have an opening or communication with the immea&s;ur|able aby&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="284">Among other &s;ingular things, there is a fre&s;h-water river near Gaarden Stafseng, on Helgeland, in which turbot, and other &s;ea-fi&s;h is &s;ometimes caught, though this river has not the lea&s;t vi&s;ible communication with the &s;ea; but, it mu&s;t have it by &s;ome &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>There is a remarkable property in the water of the north &s;ea, namely, an oiline&s;s or fatne&s;s, which, when a &s;hip is on fire, &s;o far from extingui&s;hing it, encrea&s;es the flame. This oiline&s;s has probably &s;ome connexion with it's effulgence and &s;cintillations, for when the water is &s;tirred by rowing or otherwi&s;e, it ap|pears on fire. This hitherto inexplicable phaenomenon, has been illu&s;trated in the be&s;t manner, by a little piece, publi&s;hed at Venice, called <HI>Nuovo Scoperto intorno di luci Notturne dell' aqua Marina,</HI> which though our purpo&s;e is not to enter far into <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory,</HI> as it may entertain our readers, we will give the author's account of it.

He &s;hook this gra&s;s over a &s;heet of paper, and one of the&s;e parti|cles fell off, it was as &s;ubtile as an eye-la&s;h, about as long, and it's colour, a black yellow. On examining it with a micro&s;cope, he plainly found it to be a living worm, or annular maggot, con&s;i&s;ting of eleven wings, and as many <HI>mamillae</HI> or teats on the &s;ides, in&s;tead of feet, and both at the head and rump, four <HI>antennae</HI> or feelers, like the horns of a &s;nail. In the pro&s;ecu|tion of his re&s;earches, he found that all the&s;e lucid ap|pearances in the water, aro&s;e from the&s;e minute and and almo&s;t invi&s;ible maggots, who&s;e whole bodies were lucid, though when at re&s;t, their refulgence was con|&s;iderably fainter.

<P><PB N="266" REF="286">In the 68th degree, near the i&s;land Mo&s;koe, is ano|ther &s;ingular thing. The current between that i&s;land and the next, is &s;o rapid and violent, that it's roarings exceed tho&s;e of a cataract, and are heard at a great di&s;tance. They continue without intermi&s;&s;ion, except for a quarter of an hour in every &s;ix hours, that is, at the time of high and low water, when it's impetuo&s;ity is at a &s;tand; at this time, fi&s;hermen can venture in, but this motion &s;oon returns, and however calm the &s;ea may be, gradually increa&s;es, and runs back with &s;uch a draught and whirling vortex, as to &s;uck in whatever comes within it's &s;phere of motion, and keep it under water for &s;ome hours, when the fragments, &s;hivered by the rocks, appear again. This and three other vortices, among the Ferroe i&s;lands, (which are about twenty-four in number, belong to the crown of Denmark, but add little to it's revenue, lie about 12 degrees we&s;t of Norway, four degrees north-ea&s;t of Shetland, and contain about 4000 inhabitants.) The&s;e vortices, have no other cau&s;e than the colli&s;ion of the waves ri&s;ing and falling, at the flux and reflux, again&s;t a ridge of rocks, which confines the water, &s;o that it precipitates it&s;elf like a cataract. Thus, the higher the flood, the deeper mu&s;t be the fall, and the natural re&s;ult of this is, a whirl-pool or vortex. This whirl-pool at Mo&s;koe, is called <HI>Mo&s;koe-&s;trom,</HI> and by navigators, the navel of the &s;ea. When the &s;ea is agitated by a &s;torm, it is dangerous to come within five miles of it. Perhaps it is hardly in the power of fancy
<PB N="267" REF="287">
to conceive a &s;ituation of more horror, than of being thus driven forward, by the &s;udden violence of an im|petuous torrent, to the vortex of a whirl-pool, of which the noi&s;e and turbulence, &s;till encrea&s;ing as it is approached, are an earne&s;t of quick and inevitable de&s;truction; while the wretched victims, in an agony of de&s;pair and terror, cry out for that help which they know to be impo&s;&s;ible, and &s;ee before them the dread aby&s;s, into which they are about to be plunged, and da&s;hed among the rocks at the bottom. Large &s;tocks of firs and pine-trees, after being ab&s;orbed by the current, ri&s;e again, broken and torn to &s;uch a de|gree, as if bri&s;tles grew on them. This plainly &s;hews, that the bottom con&s;i&s;ts of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro. It happens frequently, that whales come too near the &s;tream, and are over-powered by it's violence; when it is impo&s;&s;ible to de|&s;cribe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitle&s;s &s;truggles to di&s;engage them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The fre&s;h-water &s;prings of Norway are uncommonly good; &s;o, that the common people, who live more upon water than wine, or other &s;trong liquors, hold out to a very advanced age. Some of the lakes in this country are &s;o exten&s;ive, that in former times, ac|cording to the hi&s;tory of Norway, fleets have been fitted out, and wars carried on in the&s;e inland &s;eas. In &s;ome of them are floating i&s;lands, or parcels of land, about 30 or 40 ells in length, with trees growing on
<PB N="268" REF="288">
them, which, having been &s;eparated from the main|land, are driven about, as the wind &s;ets, and when clo&s;e to the &s;hore, are &s;hoved off with a pole. They are &s;aid to grow, as it were, by the acce&s;&s;ion of reeds, gra&s;s, weeds and the like. This may be wonderful, but not &s;o much &s;o, as what is called the <HI>Mardyne,</HI> which, as I am told, &s;ays <HI>Pontoppidan,</HI> is frequently met with in the &s;alt-water creeks; the&s;e are level clods, compo&s;ed of &s;ea-gra&s;s, twigs, and the foam of the &s;ea, upon which fi&s;hermen &s;ay, certain &s;ea-fowls lay their eggs. If this be matter of fact, it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged another in&s;tance of the wi&s;e di&s;po&s;ition of the Creator.</P>
<P>At any great di&s;tance from the &s;ea, the rivers of Norway are not navigable for a ve&s;&s;el of any con&s;i|derable burden, on account of the number of water|falls, from the height of &s;ix to ten fathoms; but they &s;erve to convey large timber, by floating it. The owners mark the&s;e timbers, and tru&s;t them to the cur|rent; and, at places where they wi&s;h them to be con|veyed to, large booms fortified with iron bolts are laid acro&s;s the river to &s;top them; the&s;e are called <HI>Lentzs.</HI> Here they are brought a-&s;hore, and the per&s;ons who have the care of the&s;e <HI>Lentzs,</HI> know to whom each piece belongs by it's mark, and is paid for the care taken of it. The water-falls are every where u&s;ed for working &s;aw-mills, where with little labour, planks and boards are &s;awed out to all dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="289">The&s;e water-falls, however, are not without their in|conveniences. The Gule, which has it's ri&s;e in a mountain in the north, near Skarsfield, in the year 1344, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the country, &s;eemed to|tally drained, whereas it had only buried it&s;elf under ground, from whence it again bur&s;t forth with &s;uch violence, that the earth and &s;tones, thrown up by the eruption, filled the valley and made a kind of dam, which however was broke through, and wa&s;hed away by the force of the water. On this occa&s;ion, be&s;ides &s;ome churches, 48 farm-hou&s;es were de&s;troyed, and 250 per&s;ons drowned.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of this kind, &s;till more wonderful, happened in 1702. This was the &s;udden immer&s;ion of the family &s;eat of Borge, near Frederick&s;tad, into a deep aby&s;s, the particulars of which are as follow. In the night of the fifth of February, that &s;uperb edi|fice, together with every thing in it, &s;unk down into an aby&s;s of a hundred fathom deep, and the gap was in&s;tantaneou&s;ly filled up by a piece of water, between three and four hundred ells long, and of half the breadth. The hou&s;e was doubly walled, but of the&s;e, as well as &s;everal high towers, not the lea&s;t trace was to be &s;een. With it peri&s;hed fourteen people, and 200 head of cattle. Lord and Lady Woern&s;ekiold, the owners of the hou&s;e, two children, and the &s;teward had the good fortune to e&s;cape. The lady, being then near her time, was attended by a midwife, who, in

great con&s;ternation, came to acquaint them, that the hou&s;e and ground began to give way, on which, they immediately cro&s;&s;ed the water to a &s;eat of her lord's brother, where the next day &s;he was delivered. The cau&s;e of this cata&s;trophe, was no other than the river Glomen, which is the large&s;t in Norway, precipitating it&s;elf down the water-fall, near Sarp, had probably for a long time, in it's &s;ubterraneous concealment, un|dermined the foundation. A like in&s;tance happened in Switzerland, in 1618, when the whole town of Pleurs, &s;uddenly &s;unk, in and was never &s;een after|wards.</P>

<P>NORWAY is almo&s;t every where &s;o unfit for agriculture, though not for pa&s;ture, that the proportion of ploughed ground, with re&s;pect to the meadows, woods and mountains, is not above one in eighty; and, if the pea&s;ants were not con&s;iderably a&s;|&s;i&s;ted, by the great fi&s;heries, the timber and charcoal for the mines, grazing, and the liberty they have of
<PB N="271" REF="291">
killing game, the country could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to furni&s;h &s;ub&s;i&s;tance for above half the inhababitants. Another misfortune is, their pernicious night-fro&s;ts: for, in &s;ome parts of the mo&s;t fruitful provinces, the grain is &s;ubject to mi&s;carry by &s;udden fro&s;ts; &s;o, that one day it &s;hall &s;eem fine and flouri&s;hing, and the next, owing to the nipping cold of one night, &s;hall be de&s;troyed. But when the lands are capable of culti|vation, they are &s;o prolific, as to produce from &s;ix to ten-fold, and never lie fallow. The grounds, in parch|ed &s;ea&s;ons, are always watered with &s;coops, as they wet the &s;ails of a &s;hip, by means of aqueducts, carried on by hollowed timbers from the neare&s;t &s;pring to the field; and from the land's lying warm, being &s;heltered by the mountains; though the &s;eed-time is late, the harve&s;t is forward, and farmers generally have their corn in, nine weeks from the time of &s;owing.</P>
<P>Though the farmer in Norway does not toil in the fields of an oppre&s;&s;ive lord, nor is obliged to give the tenths of his crop to &s;upport the clergy, but the fruits of his labour are his ab&s;olute and certain property, yet, agriculture here is attended with great difficulty and inconvenience, the fields con&s;i&s;ting, in general, of lit|tle &s;pots of ground among the rocks, many of which mu&s;t be dug in&s;tead of being ploughed, and all their grain is reaped. When made into &s;heaves, a great number of poles, 15 or 16 feet long are &s;tuck up in the field, and &s;ix or eight &s;heaves are hung at certain
<PB N="272" REF="292">
di&s;tances on each pole, &s;o that &s;everal days rain, if it &s;hould fall, would be &s;oon exhaled or di&s;charged, and then the corn is hou&s;ed, not with waggons, but on &s;ledges, except in &s;ome places in the frontiers, where waggons have with difficulty been introduced; for &s;o prejudiced are the Norway pea&s;ants, and &s;o tenacious of the u&s;ages tran&s;mitted to them by their fore-fa|thers, that they will adopt no new cu&s;toms, though better than the old ones; nor will they venture to re|move a &s;tone which their fathers had &s;uffered to lie. This ru&s;tic bigotry, which more or le&s;s prevails every where, is a great ob&s;truction to public utility, coun|teracting all improvements in hu&s;bandry, the pea&s;ants here being more inclined to become fi&s;hermen and the like, than to clear and improve their lands. This error, however, gradually lo&s;es ground, and an enquiry is now made for &s;pots proper for &s;owing, &s;tones begin to be removed, and fens and mora&s;&s;es drained by covered trenches. In clearing the fore&s;t or wood ground, they proceed in the following manner. Having felled the timber, they leave it on the ground two years to dry, at the end of which time, they &s;et fire to it, generally about Mid&s;ummer, but when the clouds promi&s;e rain. The wood being burnt as much as po&s;&s;ible, the greater pieces quenched, and the le&s;&s;er, together with the &s;ur|face of the &s;oil, the mo&s;s and &s;mall roots being redu|ced to a&s;hes, without &s;taying till the earth grows cool, they &s;ow rye on the a&s;hes, &s;till &s;o hot, that the &s;eed cracks, &s;naps, and denotes that the hu&s;ks are &s;plit.
<PB N="273" REF="293">
They wait then for rain to &s;oak them; and if this happens, the pea&s;ant may &s;et down in the certain pro&s;|pect of &s;uch an exuberant rye-harve&s;t, as will &s;carce appear credible, yet neverthele&s;s true, for without &s;ome extroardinary accident, a &s;ingle bu&s;hel of burnt rye, will produce from 50 to 80 bu&s;hels; which is cer|tainly the effect of a concentration of the vegetative &s;pirit in the a&s;hes, which before it can evaporate, im|pregnates the grain with &s;uch wonderful fecundity. But the&s;e conflagrations &s;ometimes do a great deal of mi&s;chief, for the knops of the pines, will &s;hoot along the air like rockets, and have been known to &s;et fire to hou&s;es, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. And when the fir&s;t fro&s;ts &s;eizes the green wood, it is not only violent, from the turpentine, but attended with a boi&s;terous wind, and dreadful roarings.</P>
<P>All &s;orts of grain are produced in this country, and their pa&s;turages or meadows are &s;o liberally ble&s;t, as not only to equal other countries, but to &s;urpa&s;s many. Farmers keep a great number of cows, and fat &s;o many cattle, that they export a great deal of butter and tallow. When &s;eed-time is over, and the people can be &s;pared, they drive their cattle to the mountains, which, at that &s;ea&s;on, afford &s;ufficient fod|der; for the &s;now is no &s;ooner melted, than the gra&s;s appears &s;even or eight inches high, grown under the &s;now. If the di&s;tance of this pa&s;turage be not more than five miles, the milk is brought home twice a day,
<PB N="274" REF="294">
but if the di&s;tance be ten or fifteen miles, they erect huts, here a maid-&s;ervant con&s;tantly lives, for the &s;ecurity of the cattle again&s;t the wild-bea&s;ts, who generally fly from &s;uch a weak keeper. This maid is employed in making butter and chee&s;e, which &s;he brings home once or twice a week.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t places, they cut their gra&s;s for hay, with &s;cythes, but in &s;ome, reap it with a &s;ickle, and to dry it, hang it on a fence made with &s;takes, fixed upright and cro&s;&s;ed with poles.</P>
<P>All kinds of e&s;culent and garden vegetables are found here in gardens, as in other countries. There is a kind of northern turnep, called <HI>Naper,</HI> which is &s;old in the cities in great quantities; they are &s;ometimes very large, as flat as a di&s;h, and a &s;ingle one has been known to weigh 27lb.</P>
<P>There are here al&s;o, a great variety of medicinal herbs and flowers, and &s;ome noxious ones, and many whole&s;ome and palatable berries, peculiar to the coun|try. With re&s;pect to fruits; grapes, peaches, and apricots do not ripen well here, but plumbs do; but as to apples, pears and cherries, they are met with every where.</P>

The&s;e and all other circum&s;tances con&s;idered, want of wood in Norway, mu&s;t have been at lea&s;t as great, as the pre&s;ent abundance of it in mo&s;t provinces, had not nature endued the &s;oil, even in the mo&s;t barren moun|tains, with a mo&s;t &s;ingular fecundity in the &s;ponta|neous production of trees; an evidence of which are the many &s;hoots from the &s;malle&s;t fi&s;&s;ures of the rocks, which thrive much better, than when carefully planted in a good &s;oil. So much is exported, that &s;ometimes &s;uch piles of it are &s;een in the ports, like little mountains, that one would imagine it mu&s;t re|quire a long time to remove them; whereas a &s;ingle embarkation for England, Holland, France or Spain, in a few days, &s;weeps them all away; a few weeks, however, cover the quays again. The &s;aw-works are the be&s;t manufacture in Norway, an infinite num|ber of families getting a comfortable maintenance from them, together with the felling and floating of timber.
<PB N="276" REF="296">
The tenth of all &s;awed timber belongs to the crown of Denmark, to which Norway is &s;ubject, and makes a con&s;iderable branch of the revenue. The va&s;t, thick fore&s;ts, every where &s;eem to remove any apprehen&s;ions of the country's being in want of common timber; but as to fir-trees and oaks, it is to be feared, po&s;terity will be at &s;ome lo&s;s for them, unle&s;s the fore&s;t-laws are more &s;trictly executed, and young trees forbidden to be exported. To give the reader an idea of the va|lue of a &s;hip's ma&s;t, we mu&s;t tell him, that a choice ma&s;t tree, which when &s;tanding, &s;hall be e&s;timated at 100 rix-dollars, or about 22<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> Engli&s;h, cannot, after it is cut down, be conveyed to the &s;ea-ports, for le&s;s than double the prime co&s;t; for, be&s;ides the many other trees required to form a kind of bed for it to &s;lide on, le&s;t it &s;hould be injured by the rocks, &s;ome|times a hundred trees and upwards mu&s;t be felled to make way for it, and labourers are employed to hawl it in places impa&s;&s;ible for hor&s;es. The red fir, will &s;tand &s;everal hundred years; the farm-hou&s;e of Naes, in Gulbrand&s;dale, in which king Oluf lodged, in 1022, when he took a circuit round the kingdom, is now &s;tanding, (1750,) and from the roots of fir-trees, the pea&s;ants extract tar, even a hundred years after the trunk has been cut down. This tar is a very profitable com|modity, and the London di&s;pen&s;aries are covetous of having it from Nord&s;iord, in this country.</P>

Marble, which in mo&s;t countries is &s;o &s;carce, and bought up at &s;o great a price, is found here in &s;everal places, and in &s;uch quantities, that if all Europe were to be &s;upplied from hence, the quarries would not be exhau&s;ted.

<P>But among the produce of the Norway mountains, are their great trea&s;ures of metals and minerals. Paracel|&s;us predicted that between the 60th and 70th degree northern latitude, time would di&s;play &s;uch a &s;tore of wealth in metals, as &s;hould be &s;uperior to all the trea|&s;ures that ever the ea&s;t afforded. Should time verify this prediction, the generation then in being mu&s;t con&s;true it as a completion of the words of Job, 37, 2.

But that mine &s;oon failed, as the gold, though fine, would not bear the expence of working. The &s;ilver-mines, however, are unque&s;tionably one of the greate&s;t di&s;tinctions of this country. There are now two carrying on, to the va&s;t advantage of the &s;o|vereign and the community. The&s;e are the works of Kong&s;berg and Jare&s;berg.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="299">The fir&s;t lies near Sand&s;werd, twenty miles from Drammen, and is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, and of the greate&s;t profit of any in Europe; and in re&s;pect of pure, ma&s;&s;y, &s;ilver veins, quite inexhau&s;tible; whereas, the German &s;ilver ore is in a great mea&s;ure invi&s;ible, and mu&s;t be extracted from the lead or copper, in which it is concealed. This work was began in the year 1623, and was di&s;covered in the following manner. Two pea|&s;ants attending their cattle on tho&s;e &s;teep mountains, which &s;eparate Telemark from Numedal, found the fir&s;t &s;ilver-ore in &s;ome fragments of &s;tone fallen from the mountains, and which by way of pa&s;time, they u&s;ed to throw to one another; when they heard a jingling &s;ound. The metallic &s;ub&s;tance it yielded they, imagined to be lead, and carrying it home, tried to melt it into bullets, buttons, and the like; but not be|ing able to effect it, they &s;old it to a gold&s;mith, who u&s;ed to &s;ell his goods about the country. This man informed government of it, and orders were given to &s;urvey the parts, where it was found, the re&s;ult of which was &s;o favourable, that miners were &s;ent for from Germany. The&s;e were the inhabitants of the new-built mine-town of Kong&s;berg, and the ance&s;tors of many thou&s;ands now living there, who in proce&s;s of time, mixed with the Norwegians. Each nation to this day performs divine &s;ervice in it's own language, but all are under the direction and government of the college of miners; their college, however, has &s;ince undergone &s;everal changes, and the work has been
<PB N="280" REF="300">
carried on &s;ometimes by a company of &s;harers, and &s;ometimes, as at pre&s;ent, by the king alone. The Kong&s;berg ore, is found frequently in &s;olid ma&s;&s;es of &s;ome magnitude; the miners, indeed, dig through the rocks for weeks and find nothing; but, by and by, the rock &s;uddenly exhibits &s;everal thou&s;and pounds weight of &s;ilver, and thus repays them for all their trouble, and animates them to further pro&s;ecution. In the Royal Mu&s;eum, at Copenhagen, a piece is pre&s;erved, of which the whole world cannot produce it's equal, it's weight being 560lb. and it's value 5000 rix-dol|lars, upwards of &pound;.1000 &s;terling. The &s;haft called "Old God's ble&s;&s;ing," one of the mo&s;t ancient and rich among all the mines, which &s;ometimes within a week has yielded &s;ome hundreds of pounds of rich ore, never fails to &s;trike the beholder with it's a&s;toni&s;hing depth, being no le&s;s than 180 fathoms perpendicular, and the circumference at the bottom, forms a clear &s;pace of &s;ome hundred fathoms. The &s;ight of &s;o many piles of wood burning on all &s;ides, 30 or 40 in number, in this gloomy cavern and continually fed, in order to &s;often the &s;tone, in the pro&s;ecution of the mine, &s;eems, according to the common idea, an image of Hell, and the &s;warms of miners, bu&s;tling about in habits accord|ing to their &s;everal occupations, may well pa&s;s for &s;o many devils.

The produce of this mine is annually
<PB N="281" REF="301">
on an average, &pound;.200,000 a year, and employs about 4,582 men, part of near 11,000 people dwelling in the town of Kong&s;berg.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity, &s;ays a French traveller, led me into one of the&s;e mines, a crane erected over the &s;hafts for draw|ing up the ore in tubs, let me down the &s;ame way; I got into the tub and was lowered plea&s;antly enough, but when I got to the bottom, it looked like Pluto's kingdom: there was nothing to be &s;een but frightful caverns, flaming fires, and creatures, more like dae|mons than men. They were cloathed in black leather jackets, each having a camail, &s;uch as prie&s;ts in France wear in the winter, a piece of peaked leather tied round his head a little above his no&s;e, and hanging down on his brea&s;t like a muffler, and an apron of the &s;ame. Some of the&s;e miners u&s;e the chizel, &s;ome the hatchet, to beat out the copper &s;tones, while others are &s;eeking for the copper veins, or &s;ounding, to try if they can di&s;cover any watry place, which &s;ometimes is hid in the bowels of the earth, and breaking forth on a &s;udden, drowns them all, without the greate&s;t care. The ma&s;ter-miner, who attended me, finding I was taken with a cold fit, owing to the damp of the place, rung a bell and we were drawn up as ea&s;ily as we were let down.</P>
<P>The other &s;ilver mine was di&s;covered in 1726, and lies near Bragnas: it's ore is very rich, but like that
<PB N="282" REF="302">
of the German mines, has a large mixture of lead and copper with it, and mu&s;t be &s;eparated by fu&s;ion; but this is expected to turn out equal to the other.</P>
<P>Of the copper mines there are many, and their im|portance may be conceived from hence, that be&s;ides the many millions which, for the&s;e hundred years pa&s;t, have accrued from them to private per&s;ons, the tenths alone bring an annual revenue to the crown, of thirty or forty thou&s;and rix-dollars, or near &pound;.23,000, and upon a Swedi&s;h inva&s;ion, a draught of 5000 effective men, has been made out of the workmen in the&s;e mines. However, next to the timber, iron is one of the mo&s;t profitable products of Norway, &s;everal hun|dred thou&s;and quintals being annually exported, partly in bars, and partly in ca&s;t-iron, as &s;toves, cannon, pots, kettles and the like; the natural profit of which is e&s;timated at three or four hundred thou&s;and rix-dol|lars, or &pound;.90,000 &s;terling.

<P>OF four-footed bea&s;ts, Norway has tho&s;e in com|mon with England, and al&s;o the elk and rein-deer, bears, wolves, the lynx, the glutton, the martin, ermines, beavers, and the lemming or Norway mou&s;e.</P>
<P>Their hor&s;es are generally &s;mall, but well propor|tioned, plump and round. Their colour chiefly a deep bay, with black manes and tails, and a &s;treak along the back. They are fed only with hay, but yet are &s;pirited, &s;wift, and in good condition, owing mo&s;t probably to their not being gelt. For ten miles about Bergen, no pea&s;ants dare keep a mare; &s;o that nothing is u&s;ed but &s;tone-hor&s;es, for as there are no coach-roads for hor&s;es to draw on, in pairs, every thing brought to this city, is packed on the backs of hor&s;es, driven &s;ingle, three or four together, one before ano|ther, and were the&s;e hor&s;es to meet with mares, there would be frequently mi&s;chief. As it is, the hor&s;eman mu&s;t take great care, for when the&s;e hor&s;es meet, they &s;eldom part without a &s;ignal of animo&s;ity. Norway hor&s;es are very &s;ure-footed, they go dancing along, al|ways full of &s;pirit, and a&s;cend and de&s;cend the highe&s;t
<PB N="284" REF="304">
&s;teeps, be they ever &s;o &s;lippery, in a &s;urprizing man|ner. When feeding in the mountains, &s;hould they be attacked by a wolf or bear, they &s;hew a great deal of courage, fighting with their &s;ore-legs, and generally come off victorious; for if any one attempts to turn about and kick, the bear or wolf will in&s;tantly leap on his back; in which ca&s;e he gallops off with his angry rider, till he drops down by the lo&s;s of blood.</P>
<P>Cows here are al&s;o &s;mall, and don't give more than about four quarts of milk; but feed is cheap, and farmers keep a great number. In &s;pring, when they are fir&s;t turned out; they make a large fire in the fields, to which the cattle in the farm-yard all run, particularly in cold nights, and lay round it. For winter-feed, the pea&s;ants cut off the boughs of trees in &s;ummer-time, tie them up in bundles, dry them, and bring them home by cart-loads, of which the cattle eat the leave and young branches; but in fi&s;hing towns, for want of other food, they feed their cows, with cod's heads, and fi&s;h bones. Nay, cows here will even eat, the bones of their own &s;pecies, which they break and &s;wallow greedily, and will gnaw them as a dog does. The pea&s;ants give their cows daily, a little &s;alt, which whets their appetite, and &s;ometimes throw them a red-herring, which they apprehend is a treat to a, cow, as well as to a human creature.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="305">Of the &s;heep there is nothing remarkbale but their &s;tanding together in the winter under the &s;now, and eating one another's wool, as in other &s;nowy countries. The place where they collect them&s;elves is di&s;covered by the warm damp that ri&s;es above the &s;now. Country people are here very fond of and keep too many goats, for they often injure the young trees. From Bergen alone is &s;hipped off annually 70 or 80,000 goat-&s;kins, exclu&s;ive of &s;everal thou&s;ands dre&s;&s;ed for Suffian, Cor|duan and Ru&s;&s;ia leather. The&s;e creatures climb the rocks and &s;teeps inacce&s;&s;ible to men. Wherever gra&s;s is to be found, they will get at it, when no other gra&s;s-feeding animal can; but they often thus get them&s;elves into &s;uch dangerous &s;ituations, as not to be able to &s;tir either one way or another. When &s;o circum&s;tanced they will bray loudly, and the Norway pea&s;ant, to &s;ave his goat, will &s;uffer him&s;elf to be let down by a rope a hundred fathom or more, as we have already mention|ed, venturing him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, as another man would not do for his be&s;t friend. Where goats run wild, as they often do in this country, till they are ten or twelve years old, they are &s;o bold, that if a wolf comes towards them alone, they will not go out of his way, and if they have dogs with them, will re&s;i&s;t a whole herd. A goat will frequently attack a &s;erpent, and when he is bit by it, will devour it, though he is at &s;ome trouble in &s;o doing. It will di&s;order him for &s;ome days, but &s;eldom kills him.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="306">Hares are here in great plenty and turn white, as in Lapland, in the winter-&s;ea&s;on. In winter, they catch mice like cats and pur&s;ue them under the &s;now.</P>
<P>The Elk is an animal who&s;e form is between the hor&s;e and the &s;tag, and is here called by &s;ome <HI>Equicer|vus.</HI> They are &s;o long legged, that a man can &s;tand upright under their belly; are of an a&s;h colour and have horns on their head like deer, but not &s;o long and round, rather flat and broad with &s;mall points about the edges. They are harmle&s;s creatures and keep about the hou&s;es in winter: their fle&s;h is much of the ta&s;te of veni&s;on, and the hide &s;ells for a good price, being converted in|to buff leather.</P>
<P>The Rein-deer we have given an account of in our de&s;cription of Lapland, &s;o have we of the Glutton, and &s;ome other animals of this country. They here run wild, and are &s;hot and &s;old like other game.</P>
<P>Bears are found all over Norway. They are a fierce, ravenous and cunning creature. The bear is &s;aid to carry her young but a month, brings forth two or three at a litter, blind and naked, and as &s;mall as mice, each in form like a mere lump, which the mo|ther continually Ecks till it expands or unfolds it&s;elf. When the&s;e young ones are bringing up, it is dangerous to meet the old ones, for then they will attack, whil&s;t at other times, they are only upon the defen&s;ive, again&s;t

mankind, excepting it be a pregnant woman, who&s;e condition they know by &s;cent or by in&s;tinct, and with all their might will &s;trive to get at the foetus. A cler|gyman, &s;ays bi&s;hop <HI>Pontoppidan,</HI> told me, he would not believe this, till he &s;aw an experiment with a young tame bear, which he chained in his yard. Leading a woman with child almo&s;t up to him, he began to make an uncommon noi&s;e, reared and tore about &s;o, that they were obliged to &s;hoot him. A clergyman's wife al&s;o related to me, continues he, the danger her hu&s;|band once found her in, when big with child. Return|ing home on a &s;ummer's evening, he &s;aw a bear, trying and taking all the pains he could to break open the door of her bed-chamber, where &s;he lay in the greate&s;t angui&s;h, hearing him roaring and jumping up in vain at the window, which fortunately for her was too high for him. From this it is to be ob&s;erved, that if any of tho&s;e women, who are a whole &s;ummer in the coun|try attending upon the cows, &s;hould lo&s;e their virtue and become pregnant, &s;he would be daily in danger of her life, otherwi&s;e the&s;e poor girls are &s;o intrepid, that they will often pur&s;ue a bear, hollowing, with &s;ticks, in their hands, and hunt him till he leaves his prey behind.</P>
<P>The bear has never been known to hurt a child, his food in nece&s;&s;ity is roots, gra&s;s, and wild angelica; but animal food &s;uits his palate be&s;t, as the fle&s;h of &s;heep, goats, cows, and hor&s;es. His attack is with his fore|paws,
<PB N="288" REF="308">
not u&s;ing his mouth till he is ma&s;ter of the crea|ture, when he &s;ucks it's blood and drags the carca&s;e to his den. If the way to it be up-hill, or through bu&s;hes, that he cannot drag it ea&s;ily along, he has been &s;een to take the whole carca&s;s in his fore-paws, walking on his hind legs only.</P>
<P>Of this creature's prudence and di&s;cretion, they give innumerable in&s;tances; among many, the mo&s;t &s;ingular and credible, is that, out of a whole herd of cows, he picks out that which has the bell about her neck, which by running, generally gives the &s;ignal of danger. At this bell he is mightily offended, he tears it off, and if it is a hammered one, will &s;trike it &s;o flat with his paw, that it &s;hall never &s;peak or vex him again. He will fire off a gun, when he has taken it from his pur|&s;uer, and &s;hews a great deal of cunning in &s;aving his life, when &s;et upon by two or three together. When the fir&s;t that fires at him has mi&s;&s;ed his aim, or &s;lightly wounded him, he will &s;ly upon the unarmed man, and hugging him, will retreat upon his hind legs as far as he can, knowing very well the others will not &s;hoot at him, for fear of &s;hooting their companion; when he has thus retreated to the edge of a bank or hill, he will throw him&s;elf down with the man, and there leave him dead or alive: &s;ometimes the fall will kill them both. If he finds him&s;elf mortally wounded, he en|deavours to rob the hunters of his hide, which he knows they come for, and will therefore lay hold of a

very large &s;tone, and if there be a deep water near him, will plunge him&s;elf into it. When the farmers go out a bear-hunting, they go commonly three or four in company. As &s;oon as they meet with one, they force him and tire him, fir&s;t with their &s;mall dogs, which are broke in for the purpo&s;e, and who run under his belly and lay hold of his genitals. Large dogs he will &s;eize on at once and tear them to pieces; but when the little ones have worried and tired him, he will get up to the &s;ide of a tree or rock, &s;et his back again&s;t it, and tearing up the &s;tones and earth will throw them at his pur&s;uers. At this time the mark&s;man &s;hoots him with a rifled-barrel gun; if he receives the ball in his che&s;t, or under the &s;houlder, or in his ear, he falls; if not, he grows outrageous and will fly upon the &s;hoot|er, who then de&s;ends him&s;elf with a dagger, which a Norwegian farmer always carries about him, hanging at his &s;ide by a bra&s;s chain. Should he not &s;ucceed with this, he lo&s;es his life, if no one is at hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; for the bear fleas his &s;kin off, pulling the hair and fle&s;h over his head and ears, face and all. Sometimes, however, the bear is contented with beating his con|quered foe with his paws till he &s;eems to be dead; and when he perceives that he draws no more breath, will leave him. A life has, &s;ometimes, been &s;aved this way. If the farmer conquers, which is almo&s;t always the ca&s;e, he fleas the bear and fixes up the head on his hou&s;e, as a trophy of his victory. A hide will &s;ell for five or &s;ix rix-dollars (each rix-dollar 4s, 6d. Engli&s;h.)
<PB N="290" REF="310">
The fle&s;h is not much liked, ta&s;ting like liver, but a &s;at bear-ham is a great delicacy.</P>
<P>Fierce as the wolf is, he is daunted at the lea&s;t oppo|&s;ition, and only bold and daring again&s;t tho&s;e who fly before him. Even a cow or goat that turns again&s;t him will put him to flight. Hunger will make a wolf in winter-&s;ea&s;on &s;eize a dog chained in a farm-yard, and upon the ice take away a hor&s;e from a &s;ledge; which obliges travellers at that time of year, to go armed: many contrivances are u&s;ed to de&s;troy them. In&s;tru|ments to blow them up; charged guns, laid by a car|ca&s;e, that go off with the lea&s;t touch; deep holes with &s;ecret traps above, into which they fall; and it is re|markable, that when another animal falls into the &s;ame pit with a wolf, as is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e; the wolf is found &s;neaking in a corner, at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from his fellow-pri&s;oner, whom, out of fear, he dare not approach.</P>
<P>The lynx or lo&s;&s;en, in Norway called <HI>goupe,</HI> is &s;ome|thing like a wolf, but &s;maller, and is of the cat or tyger kind. It is, however, equally fierce and danger|ous, and tears all to pieces that it can ma&s;ter. It's &s;kin is light-grey or white with black &s;pots like the panther, and is &s;old from eight to twelve rix-dollars each, according to their goodne&s;s.

him&s;elf; the dog, on this, lays hold and thinks him&s;elf conqueror; but the goupe then makes u&s;e of his claws &s;o effectually, as to flay his enemy alive.</P>
<P>To what we have &s;aid of the ermine in our account of Lapland, we will here add, from the authority of Bp. <HI>Pontoppidan,</HI> that in calm weather, they will &s;wim to the &s;mall i&s;lands in &s;earch of the eggs of water-fowl, which they are very fond of; and when they have their young on any of the&s;e i&s;lands, they will bring them to the continent on a piece of chip or bit of wood; the mother &s;wimming behind and with her &s;nout &s;hoving it along. Small as this creature is, it is capable of de|&s;troying the elk or bear, by creeping into their ears when they lie a&s;leep, and laying fa&s;t hold with their teeth; when the large animal feels him&s;elf thus attack|ed, he begins to run about and roars, till he has ex|hau&s;ted him&s;elf; at length, being wearied out, he be|comes faint, droops, langui&s;hes and dies. In the &s;ame manner will the ermine, &s;teel him&s;elf upon a &s;leeping eagle, and will let this bird fly away with him upon it's back, where he continues gnawing him, till by the great effu&s;ion of blood, the bird drops down dead on the ground.</P>
<P>In the body of the Beaver is a bag, in which is the precious ca&s;tor of the &s;hops; with this and with his fine dark-brown &s;kin is carried on a con&s;iderable trade at Elverum's fair. The beaver is an amphibious animal,
<PB N="292" REF="312">
living as well in water as on land. Not to mention their manner of building their hou&s;es here, would be unpar|donable, for though many of our readers may be ac|quainted with it from reading other books, many, per|haps know nothing about it. The beaver is &s;haped like a long-bodied dog, with &s;hort legs, a &s;hort and flat head, &s;mall round ears and eyes, a large thick and &s;mooth tail, which weighs &s;everal pounds, the &s;kin of which is covered with fi&s;h &s;cales, and is &s;o much of the fi&s;hy kind as to ta&s;te like fi&s;h, and cannot bear to be long out of the water; the re&s;t of his body is fle&s;h. The Roman Catholicks con&s;ider the tail as fi&s;h and eat it as &s;uch. His hinder feet, are webbed like tho&s;e of a goo&s;e, and are of the &s;ame fle&s;hy nature. As his tail cannot be long out of water, the beaver builds his hou&s;e in &s;uch a manner, that he can always have his hind part hanging in a place which is open from ice all the winter, that, he may continually throw his tail forwards and backwards in free water.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure of this advantage even where the water ri&s;es and falls, he builds always at the water-edge, a wooden hou&s;e three &s;tories high, and regularly rai&s;ed above one another like a little tower, where he and his mate have each their &s;eparate lodging and bed. To fell the trees for building of the&s;e hou&s;es, the wi&s;e Creator has furni&s;hed this little animal with a tooth, four or five inches long, and &s;harp at the end not unlike a boar's tu&s;k; with this, as with a &s;mall ax, he prepares
<PB N="293" REF="313">
the wood for the joi&s;ts, fits all together and lays them &s;o, over one another, that they will not fall. After this, to tran&s;port the&s;e materials to the &s;pot, he u&s;es a mo&s;t &s;urprizing dexterity, as I am a&s;&s;ured, &s;ays <HI>Pon|toppidan,</HI> by many who have been witne&s;&s;es. A num|ber are employed on this work together, and one will &s;uffer him&s;elf to be u&s;ed as a cart, which the others like hor&s;es take hold off, fa&s;tening on him by the neck, and dragging him along; for this purpo&s;e, he fir&s;t throws him&s;elf on his back, with his legs up, between which they lay their prepared timber, and in this manner convey it to the &s;pot, one load after another; but this always co&s;ts the fir&s;t a bare back, for it takes off all the hair.</P>
<P>Of the otter, as it is well known in this country, we &s;hall only &s;ay, upon the authority of <HI>Pontoppidan,</HI> that when young, they may be tamed; for, that a cre|dible neighbour of his a&s;&s;ured him, he had &s;o u&s;ed one to the hou&s;e, by feeding him with milk, that, at command, he would go into the river and fetch him a fi&s;h or two, at any time.</P>
<P>The lemming or Norway mou&s;e, is that mountain mou&s;e we have de&s;cribed in our <HI>Account of Lapland,</HI> and to which we mu&s;t the reader.</P>
<P>After the quadrupeds, we come to &s;peak of creep|ing animals. As to &s;erpents, toads, and other poi&s;on|ous
<PB N="294" REF="314">
creatures of that kind, they are not found but in the &s;outhern parts of Norway. To &s;hew the power of &s;erpents even over birds which do not &s;eem &s;ubject to them, <HI>Pontoppidan</HI> relates on the authority of many credible witne&s;&s;es, that as one of them lies on the ground, he will rai&s;e his head about nine inches, with his mouth opened, till a lark or a &s;wallow, or &s;ome low-flying bird, in it's flight, happens to have the mi&s;|fortune to come perpendicularly over him; on this, the bird continues &s;tationary, though at &s;ome fa|thoms height, and finding it&s;elf irri&s;i&s;tably impelled, begins to cry &s;adly, and at la&s;t, drops directly into the &s;erpent's mouth, who well knows how to &s;eparate the feathers, and throw them out. That this happens, is corroborated by other authors. Sir <HI>Hans Sloane</HI> &s;ays the &s;ame of the American rattle-&s;nake. But how the effluviae ri&s;ing from the natural powers of the &s;nake or &s;erpent &s;hould attract the bird, we leave others to in|ve&s;tigate. In one of the Hamburg Magazines, is Dr. C. J. Sprenger's experiment with a mou&s;e, which was let loo&s;e on the ground to a &s;nake; it made a few turns, &s;queaked a little, and then run directly into the &s;nake's mouth, who all the while lay &s;till, with his mouth open.</P>
<P>We &s;hall pa&s;s over lizards, frogs, &s;nails, gra&s;s-hop|pers, worms, &s;piders, caterpillars, flies, ants, &amp;c. common to other countries, and mention the clu&s;ter-worm peculiar to Norway. It is properly a congeries of animals and con&s;i&s;ts of a great number of &s;mall
<PB N="295" REF="315">
worms, gathered and extended a great way along the earth, ju&s;t like a rope of many fathoms, a finger and a half or two fingers broad. Each worm is not thicker than a piece of cour&s;e thread and as long as a barley-corn, of a watry colour and a black &s;pot on the head. The&s;e worms like to be together and are found by millions, continually crawling upon each other, yet &s;o, that the whole company con&s;tantly follows and leaves a path behind them like a drawn line.</P>
<P>Of birds, Norway may boa&s;t of a great variety, &s;ea as well as land, &s;ome in common with other countries, and &s;ome little known but in this. Their numbers are &s;o great on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, within ten or twelve miles of the &s;hore, that one would imagine all the &s;ea-&s;owl of the univer&s;e were collected here in one flock; and they are often &s;een in &s;uch flights, as to ob&s;cure the heavens. In many places they keep dogs trained to fetching the &s;hore and &s;trand-birds out of their holes in the rocks, which are almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible. But one farmer mu&s;t not keep more of the&s;e dogs than his neighbour, that he may not prejudice him in his livelihood. The dogs as well as the farmers, run the greate&s;t hazard of their lives, in this employ, and &s;ometimes peri&s;h by unhappy falls; for they either climb up tho&s;e exce&s;&s;ive high and &s;teep rocks, finding but here and there a hold or place for their feet; or el&s;e they are let down from the top, 100 fathoms or more, that they may get into the hollows under the projecting clifts and caves
<PB N="296" REF="316">
formed by nature. At Foeroe, which exports annual|ly &s;everal thou&s;and pounds worth of feathers to Copen|hagen, there is held a bird-hunt of this kind, which is circum&s;tantially de&s;cribed by Mr. <HI>Lucas Debes,</HI> who was many years a dean in that country, and with who&s;e ac|count we &s;hall entertain our readers. It is taken from his <HI>Faeroa re&s;erata,</HI> page 140.</P>
<P>It is not to be de&s;cribed, &s;ays he, with what trouble and danger they look for the birds in the high and &s;teep rocks, many of which are more than 200 fa|thoms perpendicular; and there are particular people, who by nature are fitted for this kind of bird-catching, and are called <HI>Birdmen:</HI> they make u&s;e of two me|thods to catch them; either climbing up the&s;e per|pendicular rocks, or el&s;e being let down from the top by a &s;trong rope. When they climb up, it is by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a pole, 18 or 20 feet long, with an iron hook at the end; they who are underneath in the boat, or &s;tand on a cliff, fa&s;ten this hook to the wai&s;tband of the man's breeches who climbs, and a rope round his wai&s;t, by which means they help him up to the highe&s;t projection he can reach and fix his feet upon; then they help another up to the &s;ame place, and when they are both up, they give them each their bird-pole in their hands, and a long rope is tied round each other's wai&s;t at each end: one of them climbs up as high as he can, and where it is difficult, the other by putting his pole under his breech, pathes him up till he gets to a good
<PB N="297" REF="317">
re&s;ting place. The uppermo&s;t of the two, then helps the other up to him by a rope and &s;o on, till they get to the place where the birds build, and where they &s;earch for them. As there are, in the&s;e rocks, many dan|gerous places yet to climb, whil&s;t they are bound to|gether with a &s;trong rope, one always &s;eeks a conve|nient place to &s;tand &s;afe, whil&s;t the other is climbing about. If the latter &s;hould happen to &s;lip, he is then held up by the other, who &s;tanding firm, helps him up again, and when he has got &s;afe pa&s;t tho&s;e dangerous places, he fixes him&s;elf in the &s;ame manner, that he may a&s;&s;i&s;t the other. But accidents &s;ometimes happen, for &s;hould one not &s;tand firm, or not be &s;trong enough to &s;upport the other when he &s;lips, they both fall and are killed: and there &s;eldom a year pa&s;&s;es but &s;ome lo&s;e their lives.</P>
<P>When they reach tho&s;e places where the birds build, &s;ome are tame enough to be taken by the hand; but where they are wild, they either throw a net over them in the rock, or entangle them in a net at the end of their poles, as they are flying in and out of their holes. A boat is underneath in the &s;ea, into which they throw their dead fowl, and pre&s;ently fill it. In tolerable weather, when there is plenty of game, the birdmen will continue out in the rocks eight days together, ly|ing at nights in &s;ome hole in the rock, where provi|&s;ions are let down to them by lines, and where others go daily in boats to bring away what they kill.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="318">Many rocks are &s;o frightful and dangerous, as not to be climbed; the men then are let down from above, by a &s;trong rope, 80 or 100 fathoms long, and about three inches thick; one end of this the birdman fa&s;t|ens round his wai&s;t like a belt, and then draws it be|tween his legs, &s;o as to &s;it on it. Six men at top hold the rope, letting it &s;ink by degrees, laying a piece of timber on the edge of the rocks, that it may not cut the cord. There is another line fa&s;tened round the man's wai&s;t, which he pulls, to give &s;igns, when he would be pulled up, or let lower, &amp;c, This man is in great danger from the &s;tones in the &s;ide of the rock loo&s;ening by the rope, and falling on his head; to guard again&s;t this, he wears a thick cap; but this does not &s;ave a man's life, if large &s;tones fall on him. The experienced in this bu&s;ine&s;s thinks nothing of the danger, and will &s;hift him&s;elf from place to place with great readine&s;s, catching the birds, as he &s;wings upon the line, &s;linging him&s;elf from one ridge of the rock to another; and when he has killed a &s;ufficient number, he ties them to the &s;mall rope and they are drawn up, or fa&s;tens them to his belt, and will often work him&s;elf up by the rope. In this manner he will &s;wing about all day, and catch a great quantity of game.</P>
<P>Where there are not a &s;ufficient number of men to hold the rope, it is fixed to a po&s;t, and the birdman will &s;lide down without any help. Many of the&s;e men
<PB N="299" REF="319">
are &s;o expert at the bu&s;ine&s;s, that they will hang and climb without fear, in places, where they can but catch hold with their fingers, and pitch the ends of their toes, and when the di&s;tance between them and the &s;ea beneath, &s;hall be more than 100 fathoms.</P>
<P>Among the water-fowl met with in this country, is the eider-duck, of which we have given &s;ome account in treating of <HI>Iceland,</HI> we &s;hall only ob&s;erve further here on the authority of <HI>Pontoppidan,</HI> that as ravens and crows hunt out for the&s;e birds ne&s;ts, to &s;uck their eggs, it has made them &s;ometimes build half a mile up in the country, as a place of more &s;ecurity, and when the young ones are fit to go to &s;ea with their mother, &s;he &s;quats down, for them to climb on her back and carries them away by an even flight. This down is &s;old in Norway for 9<HI>s.</HI> a lb. Engli&s;h, and is &s;o light, warm, &s;oft, and ready to &s;pread it&s;elf, that two handfuls &s;queezed together is enough to fill a down quilt.</P>
<P>To enter into the variety of birds met with in this country, and de&s;cribe them all with their particulari|ties, would be &s;welling this work to an enormous &s;ize, and deviating from the plan we &s;et out upon, which is to de&s;cribe the different countries and their natural hi&s;|tory, only as far as is u&s;eful to a general reader; if he re|quires more, we mu&s;t refer him to tho&s;e treati&s;es which de&s;cribe the animals, birds and fi&s;hes of the &s;everal
<PB N="300" REF="320">
parts of the globe. Let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, then, that Norway has not only the birds we have mentioned, but eagles, and almo&s;t all that are common to other countries.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame with fi&s;hes, none of which we &s;hall attempt to de&s;cribe, but &s;uch as are very remarkable. We have already given an account of the va&s;t quanti|ties of fi&s;hes which the northern &s;eas afford. The fir&s;t inhabited land from the north pole, that emigrant fi&s;hes touch upon, next to Iceland, is Norway, as al&s;o the north of Scotland and the Orkneys. Such quan|tities of herrings, cod, and other valuable fi&s;hes, are caught in the northern parts of Norway, as bring in annually upwards of a million of rix-dollars. To con|template the ways of Providence in the article of fi&s;hes, mu&s;t be plea&s;ing and wonderful to a philo&s;ophic mind; and to open the reader's ideas on this &s;ubject, we will lay before him a few ob&s;ervations of <HI>Rollin,</HI> in his &s;tudy of Nature, for the &s;ervice of youth. Speaking of fi&s;hes, he &s;ays,
<Q>How many kinds of fi&s;hes of various &s;izes do the waters produce! I contemplate all the&s;e, and it &s;eems to me that there is nothing but a head and a tail. They have no hands or feet, and their head has no free motion. If I was to draw any conclu&s;ions from their form, I &s;hould think that there wanted every nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport life; yet with &s;o few external parts, they are more active, quicker, and more ingenious, than if
<PB N="301" REF="321">
they had many hands and feet. They know &s;o well how to u&s;e their fins, that they &s;hoot forward like an arrow from a bow, and rather fly than &s;wim. Fi&s;hes devour one another continually; how, therefore, it might be a&s;ked, can the&s;e inhabitants of the &s;ea &s;ub&s;i&s;t? But, here God's providence has allotted means, and ordains it thus, that their breed and in|crea&s;e &s;hall be wonderfully great, and that their fruitfulne&s;s &s;hall by much exceed their nece&s;&s;ity of devouring each other; &s;o, that tho&s;e which are eaten by others, are always very &s;hort of tho&s;e which ari&s;e from the next brood. When I con&s;ider, how the &s;mall fi&s;hes e&s;cape from the large, by whom they are looked upon as their prey, to hunt as they plea&s;e; I &s;ee the weak are much the nimbler, and are always prepared to fly to places where the water is &s;o &s;hallow, as not to admit the large to follow them. Thus has it plea&s;ed the Creator to make up their weakne&s;s, by giving them &s;o much circum|&s;pection. How is it that fi&s;hes can live and thrive in &s;uch waters as I cannot drink? How is it in the mid&s;t of &s;alt, that their fle&s;h does not ta&s;te of it? How comes it that the be&s;t and fitte&s;t fi&s;hes for the u&s;e of man, approach the &s;hore, and as it were, offer them&s;elves to our wants, and at a time when they are the fatte&s;t? When on the contrary, others, that are not &s;o u&s;eful, keep farther off? Why do herrings, mackrell, &amp;c. all which in the time of their increa&s;e and growth, live in unknown places;
<PB N="302" REF="322">
at certain &s;ea&s;ons, appear in our &s;eas, about the coa&s;ts, as if to offer them&s;elves to fi&s;hermen, and even throw them&s;elves into the nets, and on the hooks? Who&s;e hand but thine, O Lord, guides them &s;o wi&s;ely; though thy great care is &s;eldom re|ceived with due thankfulne&s;s!</Q></P>
<P>Anchovies are here &s;alted and barrelled up with &s;pi|ces, for exportation. They differ very little from the herring, except in &s;ize, being much &s;maller.</P>
<P>The Shark is a fi&s;h common to the&s;e &s;eas, of which there are &s;everal &s;pecies, but the whole tribe of &s;harks, have no bones, excepting that of the back, but only a cartilaginous or gri&s;tly &s;ub&s;tance, in&s;tead of bone. They do not, like mo&s;t kinds of fi&s;hes eject their &s;pawn, but are viviparous, and like the whale, bring forth their young alive; five or &s;ix at a birth; their &s;kin is hard and rough, and full of prickles, and their fins are u&s;ed by turners, carvers, &amp;c. to poli&s;h their work. The mouth of the &s;hark, is not placed like that of any other kind of fi&s;hes, but underneath a pretty long &s;nout, de&s;igned as it were, to prevent their de&s;troying other fi&s;hes in too great quantities, for they are obliged to turn on their backs, when they would devour their prey, unle&s;s it happens to &s;wim ju&s;t under them. The &s;hark bites very keenly, has a vo|racious appetite, and is &s;o fond of human fle&s;h, that
<PB N="303" REF="323">
they will in &s;hoals follow the Guinea &s;hips to America, for the dead negroes that are thrown overboard in the pa&s;&s;age. They have been known to bite a man's leg off, when bathing in the &s;ea. Was it not, &s;ays <HI>Sir Hans Sloane,</HI> in his voyage to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> for the nece&s;&s;ity it is under, of turning on it's back to catch it's prey, at which time the pur&s;ued fi&s;hes e&s;cape, there would be nothing that could avoid it; for it is a &s;wift &s;wim|mer, has great &s;trength, and the large&s;t &s;wallow of the fi&s;h tribe exi&s;ting. Some of them are from 40 to 50 feet long.</P>
<P>The whale here at certain &s;ea&s;ons is very generally met with. Having &s;ufficiently de&s;cribed this fi&s;h in our <HI>Account of Greenland,</HI> we &s;hall only ob&s;erve here that they are &s;een on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Norway, in va&s;t quantities about January; at this time, the &s;ea appears covered with them, and from the water &s;pouted from their no&s;trils continually, they have the appear|ance of a large city with a great many chimnies &s;moking.</P>
<P>The herring is a fi&s;h every where known, and from the Norway &s;eas, &s;ent almo&s;t all over Europe. In the Netherlands, there are above 150,000 people, &s;olely employed in this fi&s;hery. In Norway al&s;o, there are many thou&s;ands of families thus maintained. Her|rings, like mackrell, a&s;&s;emble together and follow one-another
<PB N="304" REF="324">
in va&s;t &s;hoals; and it is &s;aid, they have always a leader of their own &s;pecies, eighteen inches long, and proportionably broad, which fi&s;hermen will never de&s;troy, if they can avoid it. No one but a Norwe|gian fi&s;herman can form any idea of the largene&s;s and extent of the&s;e prodigious &s;hoals. If infinity were ap|plicable to any thing created, one might venture to make u&s;e of that word with re&s;pect to herrings, for each of them has more than 10,000 grains or eggs in it's roe.</P>
<P>A hill of herrings, (for &s;o a large &s;hoal of them is called,) according to the fi&s;hermens accounts, reaches from the bottom to the &s;urface of the water, which in mo&s;t places where they are caught, is from one hun|dred to two hundred fathoms deep. They extend al&s;o to a con&s;iderable circumference. Were they all to be caught, the greate&s;t part would be lo&s;t, for it would be impo&s;&s;ible to get hands, tubs, &s;alt, and other nece&s;&s;aries for the curing them. Several hundred &s;hip|loads are &s;ent annually from Bergen to foreign parts, be&s;ides what is con&s;umed by the pea&s;ants, who make them their daily provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>During the herring-fi&s;hery, the country people a&s;|&s;emble together on the &s;hore by thou&s;ands, while a great number put off &s;everal miles to &s;ea. At this &s;ea&s;on, one may often &s;ee in the compa&s;s of a mile, upwards of two or three hundred fi&s;hing boats, lying
<PB N="305" REF="325">
on their &s;tation for a whole month or longer, and ca&s;t|ing their large nets, which are &s;ixty or &s;eventy feet long. They generally put two of the&s;e nets together, and though there are a great many, perhaps 100 or 150 in one place, and pretty clo&s;e together, yet in a few hours they will be &s;o loaded with herrings, that they often &s;ink to the bottom, and are with great diffi|culty drawn up again. In each net they will often catch 4 or 5,000 large herrings, which hang fa&s;t by their gills in the me&s;hes. What I am going to relate, &s;ays <HI>Bp. Pontoppidan,</HI> is &s;urprizing, and what foreigners will hardly believe, but I my&s;elf am very well a&s;&s;ured of it, and the whole city of Bergen can witne&s;s the &s;ame, that with one ca&s;t of the net in Sundifiord, there were caught as many herrings as filled 100 (&s;ome &s;ay 150) jaggers, each jagger 100 tons burthen, which make 10,000 tons, taken at one draught. In <HI>Bp. Pontoppi|dan's</HI> account of Norway, there are, doubtle&s;s, many very &s;urprizing things told; but he &s;eems very cautious of advancing what appears incredible on authorities he could not rely on; where he a&s;&s;erts matters to be as he relates them, he has &s;ufficient proof of the fact, and where he does not, he gives it as a matter of doubt, and as reported only.</P>
<P>The Sturgeon is a fi&s;h in fine perfection in the North Sea. They approach the &s;hore about Mid&s;ummer, with the &s;ummer herrings, which they drive along at &s;uch a rate, that they will rai&s;e them&s;elves above the
<PB N="306" REF="326">
&s;urface of the water in the pur&s;uit. They do not &s;wim together in &s;hoals, or extend in breadth, but follow one-another in a &s;trait line, laying hold of each other's tail. As this fi&s;h is not armed with teeth, either for u&s;e or defence, the marks of Providence appear in it's peculiar &s;tructure, having thick broad &s;cales or plates of bone, which cover it's body as a coat of mail, and are it's be&s;t defence.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t of Norway is al&s;o remarkable for it's cod-fi&s;hery, where this fi&s;h is dried, or &s;alted and barrelled in great quantities. Upwards of 20,000 tons weight of dried cod has been exported from Bergen, in one year, be&s;ides a great deal of pickled cod in ca&s;ks. Great quantities are al&s;o exported from Trontheim, Chri&s;tian|&s;und, and Stavanger. And for this purpo&s;e alone are annually imported 40,000 tons of Spani&s;h and French &s;alt. Barrelled cod is chiefly &s;old in the Baltic, but dry cod at Hamburgh, Bremen and Am&s;terdam, from whence they are carried up the rivers all over Germany. Some are exported to Flanders and England, but not &s;o many as to Italy, Spain and other countries in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>As the French cannot do without the &s;pawn of Nor|way cod-fi&s;h, which they u&s;e by way of bait, to &s;trew in the &s;ea, in order to catch a &s;ort of fi&s;h &s;omething like herrings; &s;everal thou&s;and ca&s;ks of cods roe are &s;alted down every year in Norway, and the demand has been

&s;o great, that, for twenty years together, there has been annually exported fourteen or &s;ixteen &s;hip-loads of roes only, be&s;ides what they carry in their own bot|toms.

<P>The Walru&s;s, or Sea-hor&s;e, is &s;een &s;ometimes on this coa&s;t, but not &s;o frequently as about Iceland or Spitzberg, where it is found in incredible numbers; &s;everal thou&s;ands being often &s;een together.

<P>Of Shell-fi&s;h, the Norwegians al&s;o have great vari|ety, be&s;ides oy&s;ters, mu&s;cles, cockles, lob&s;ters, crabs, &amp;c. in common with other countries. Oy&s;ters are here pickled, barrelled and exported. It is &s;aid the crab and &s;tar-fi&s;h often feed upon the oy&s;ter, and when the oy&s;ter opens it's &s;hell to take in it's food, they will art|fully throw a &s;tone in, to prevent it's &s;hutting clo&s;e again and being pinched with the &s;hell. This is more wily even than the fox, who&s;e tongue or paw is often held fa&s;t, by attempting to get at the oy&s;ter. To &s;hew how large oy&s;ters have been found, there are, in the King's mu&s;eum, at Copenhagen, two oy&s;ter-&s;hells that
<PB N="308" REF="328">
were drawn up by a cable at Goa, each of which weighs 224lb. they are five feet in diameter, and the fi&s;h was &s;o large that every one of the &s;hip's crew had a con&s;ider|able piece of it.</P>
<P>In the dioce&s;e of Chri&s;tian&s;und there is a pearl fi&s;hery, belonging to the King and carried on at his expence. They are given to the Queen as one of the regalia of the Kingdom of Norway. The&s;e pearls are the produce of a &s;mall fre&s;h-water mu&s;cle, and are found in certain rivers and brooks. There is a manager or intendant pre|&s;iding over this fi&s;hery. The pearl is generally found in that part of the fi&s;h which is called the beard in the oy&s;ter, and &s;ometimes on both &s;ides, but the pearls are always flat on that &s;ide that grows to the &s;hell. There are &s;ome Norway pearls not inferior to oriental ones, but the number of the&s;e is not very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Such a trade is here carried on in lob&s;ters, that every &s;pring there are never le&s;s than 30 or 40 lob&s;ter-bu&s;&s;es, from London and Am&s;terdam, which are loaded with them, each having wells capable of containing 12,000 lob&s;ters alive.

<P>Such an infinite variety is there in the inhabitants of the ocean, that it is probable one hundredth part of them have never come to the knowledge of man, or or probably ever will. Was it po&s;&s;ible for our &s;ight to penetrate through the thick medium of water, as we can through the air, according to the accounts given by di|vers, we &s;hould &s;ee very wonderful objects. The many we have &s;een, may give the learned &s;ome idea of the re&s;t. Was it po&s;&s;ible that the &s;ea could be drained of it's waters, what incredible numbers of uncommon and amazing &s;ea-mon&s;ters, would exhibit them&s;elves to our view, which are now entirely unknown! Such a &s;ight would at once determine the truth of many hypothe&s;es, concerning &s;ea-animals, who&s;e exi&s;tence is di&s;puted and looked upon as chimerical. The following extraordi|nary &s;ea-mon&s;ters that are occa&s;ionally met with on the coa&s;t of Norway, &s;ays <HI>Pontoppidan,</HI> though they may appear incredible, are well-atte&s;ted by numbers of credible witne&s;&s;es, and hundreds of te&s;timonies might be produced for each in&s;tance, if it was required.</P>
<P>Among the many &s;ea-mon&s;ters often &s;een in the north &s;ea, the fir&s;t we &s;hall mention are the merman and mer|maid. The exi&s;tance of this creature is que&s;tioned by many, nor is it at all to be wondered at, becau&s;e mo&s;t of the accounts given of it, are blended with fables and
<PB N="310" REF="330">
idle tales; but that does not render it impo&s;&s;ible in the nature of things. It is well known there are &s;ea-hor&s;es, &s;ea-cows, &s;ea-wolves, &s;ea-hogs, &s;ea-dogs, &amp;c. &s;o called from their bearing a near re&s;emblance to the land-ani|mals of tho&s;e &s;pecies. Why then may there not be &s;ea-men and &s;ea-maids, when we know that in the tribe of land-animals, there are apes and baboons nearly re|&s;embling the human &s;pecies? I hope then I may be credited, &s;ays <HI>Bp. Pontoppidan,</HI> when I declare that in the dioce&s;e of Bergen are &s;everal hundreds of per&s;ons of credit and reputation, who affirm, with the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances, that they have &s;een this kind of creature, &s;ometimes at a di&s;tance, and at other times quite clo&s;e to their boats, &s;tanding upright and formed like a hu|man creature down to the middle: the re&s;t they could not &s;ee. I have &s;poken with many of tho&s;e people, all eye-witne&s;&s;es to the exi&s;tence of the creature, and I have taken all po&s;&s;ible precautions in examining them &s;trictly on the &s;ubject, the re&s;ult was, that I found them all agree in every particular of their accounts. But of tho&s;e who have &s;een them out of the water and handled them, I have not been able to find more than one per|&s;on of credit, who could vouch it for truth; this is the Rev. Mr. <HI>Peter Angel,</HI> mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h of Vand Elvens Gield on Sundmoer: I &s;hall relate what he a&s;|&s;ured me, when I was once on my vi&s;itation-journey. He &s;aid that in the year 1719, he, (being then about twenty years old) along with &s;everal other inhabitants of Al&s;tahoug, in Nordland, &s;aw what is called a mer|man,
<PB N="311" REF="331">
man, lying dead on a point of land, near the &s;ea, which had been ca&s;t a&s;hore by the waves. It's length was above three fathoms. It was all over of a dark-grey colour, it's lower part like a fi&s;h and had a tail like a porpus. It's face re&s;embled that of a man, with a mouth, forehead, eyes, &amp;c. It's no&s;e was flat and as it were pre&s;&s;ed down to the face, in which the no&s;trils were, however, very vi&s;ible. The bread was not far from the head, the arms &s;eemed to hang to the &s;ide to which they were joined by a thin &s;kin. The hands were, to appearance, like the paw of a &s;eal. The back of this creature was very fat, and a great part of it was cut off, which, with the liver, yielded a great quantity of train oil. Mr. <HI>Luke Debes,</HI> in his de&s;cription of Faroe, tells us, that the people there have &s;een a mermaid with a fi&s;h in her hands, of cour&s;e concludes they are ani|mals of prey. This mermaid he thus de&s;cribes,
<Q>She &s;tood clo&s;e to the &s;hore two hours and a half, and was up to the navel in water. She had long hair on her head which hung down to the &s;urface of the water all round her.</Q></P>
<P>Another wonderful &s;ea-mon&s;ter, &s;een &s;ometimes in the North, is the great Sea-&s;erpent. The&s;e creatures con|tinually keep them&s;elves at the bottom of the &s;ea, except|ing in the months of July and Augu&s;t, which is their &s;pawning time; they then come to the &s;urface of the water, in calm weather, but plunge into it again as &s;oon as the wind rai&s;es the lea&s;t wave. If it were not for this,
<PB N="312" REF="332">
the reality of this &s;nake's exi&s;tence would be le&s;s que&s;ti|oned than it is; though the coa&s;t of Norway is the only place in Europe, vi&s;ited by this terrible animal. I que&s;|tioned it's exi&s;tence my&s;elf, &s;ays <HI>Pontoppidan,</HI> till that &s;u&s;picion was removed by the full evidence of credi|ble and experienced fi&s;hermen and &s;ailors in Norway, of which there are hundreds, who can te&s;tify that they have annually &s;een them. Nay, the Honourable <HI>Lawrence de Ferry,</HI> a captain in the navy, &s;hot one in company with &s;everal men in the year 1746, all of whom made oath of the truth of it. This creature ap|pears, on a fair e&s;timate, to be full 600 Engli&s;h feet long, and it's body, in circumference, to be as big as two hog&s;heads. When it lies on the &s;urface of the water, it is in many folds, that is, there are in a line with the head, which it carries near two feet out of the &s;ea, &s;ome &s;mall parts of the back, to the number of twenty-five or more, to be &s;een above the &s;urface of the water, when it moves or bends. The&s;e, at a di&s;tance, appear like &s;o many ca&s;ks floating in a line, with a con&s;iderable di&s;tance between each. The head has a high and broad forehead, and re&s;embles that of a hor&s;e, it's &s;nout be|ing flat, with large no&s;trils and &s;everal &s;tiff hairs &s;tand|ing out, like whi&s;kers. It's eyes are very large, of a blue colour and look like two pewter plates. The whole animal is of a dark-brown colour, but &s;peckled and variegated, with light &s;treaks or &s;pots that &s;hine like tortoi&s;e&s;hell. It &s;eems to have a quick &s;mell, for, to avoid any danger ari&s;ing from them, fi&s;hermen car|ry

&s;ome ca&s;tor with them, a little of which they throw into the water, whenever it appears in &s;ight, which it always flies from; otherwi&s;e they would be in danger of being &s;unk, for this animal has been known to throw it&s;elf acro&s;s a boat and &s;ink it, and it's excrement, which floats on the &s;urface of the water is &s;o corro&s;ive, as to bli&s;ter the hands of tho&s;e who handle it. There &s;eems to be &s;ome allu&s;ion to this creature in the Pro|phet <HI>Amos,</HI> chap. 9. v. 3. <Q>And though they be hid from my light in the bottom of the &s;ea, thence will I command the &s;erpent, and he &s;hall bite them.</Q> The &s;uppo&s;ition that this &s;ea-&s;nake an&s;wers the de&s;cription of the leviathan, or the crooked &s;erpent, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 27, 1. "that &s;hall &s;lay the dragon that is in the &s;ea;" or that it may be the long &s;erpent mentioned in <HI>Job,</HI> 26, 13. is not without &s;ome foundation. <HI>Egede</HI> (an author of credit) &s;ays that in 1734, he &s;aw one that rai&s;ed it&s;elf &s;o high out of the water, that it's head reached above the main-top-ma&s;t of the &s;hip.

R. Lamy,</HI> a magi&s;trate of Dundee, in Scotland, that on Saturday, the 5th of Augu&s;t, 1786, between the hours of nine and ten in the forenoon, being on their voyage to Dundee, in la|titude 56 deg. 16 m. N. about fifteen or &s;ixteen leagues to the ea&s;tward of the i&s;land of May, they, as well as the whole crew of the &s;aid &s;hip, perceived, within le&s;s
<PB N="314" REF="334">
than one mile's di&s;tance of the &s;outhward of them, what they conceived to be an animal called in Norway a &s;ea-&s;erpent, a creature of a huge &s;ize, emerging from the &s;ea; that, from it's appearance, it &s;eemed to form three low i&s;lands, or &s;and-banks, of a greyi&s;h colour; that they conceived the length of it to have been at lea&s;t three Engli&s;h miles; that it lay &s;tretched from S. W. to N. E. that it's breadth appeared to be about twenty or thirty fathoms; and that it was in &s;ight fifty minutes and went down gradually, without any remarkable agitation of the water. From the time of it's a&s;cending and during it's appearance on the water, the weather was perfectly calm, and it went down again as &s;oon as a breeze came on. The waves broke on tho&s;e parts of it which were above water, as on a bank, and the great|e&s;t apparent height it bore above water, &s;eemed to be from two to three fathoms.</P>
<P>We come now to the <HI>Kraken,</HI> which is inconte&s;tibly the large&s;t creature of all the animal creation, and con|&s;equently de&s;erves the be&s;t account the nature of things will admit of. Norway fi&s;hermen affirm, that as they row out &s;everal miles to &s;ea, in hot &s;ummer-days, when they expect, by their &s;ituation, to find 80 or 100 fathoms of water, it often happens that they do not find above 20 or 30, and &s;ometimes le&s;s. At the&s;e places they generally find the greate&s;t plenty of fi&s;hes. By this they judge the kraken is at bottom. If the depth at this time decrea&s;es, they find the animal is
<PB N="315" REF="335">
rai&s;ing it&s;elf nearer the &s;urface, of cour&s;e they take to their oars and get off. When they have reached their u&s;ual depth and find them&s;elves out of danger, they lie upon their oars, and a few minutes after &s;ee this enormous mon&s;ter come up to the &s;urface. He there &s;hews him&s;elf &s;ufficiently, though his whole body does not appear, and in all likelihood no human eye ever beheld (except the young of this &s;pecies) it's whole back or upper part, which &s;eems to be an Eng|li&s;h mile and a half in circumference, and looks like a number of &s;mall i&s;lands, &s;urrounded with &s;omething that floats and fluctuates like &s;ea-weeds. Here and there a larger ri&s;ing is ob&s;erved like &s;and-banks, on which various kinds of &s;mall fi&s;hes are &s;een continual|ly leaping about, till they roll off into the water from the &s;ides of it; at la&s;t &s;everal bright points or horns ap|pear, which grow thicker and thicker, the higher they ri&s;e above the &s;urface of the water, and &s;ometimes they &s;tand up as high and as large as the ma&s;ts of middle-&s;ized ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the&s;e are the creature's arms, and it is &s;aid, if they were to lay hold of the large&s;t man of war, they would pull it down to the bottom. After this mon&s;ter has been on the &s;urface of the water a &s;hort time, it be|gins &s;lowly to &s;ink again, and then the danger is as great as before, for his motion occa&s;ions &s;uch a &s;well and &s;uch an eddy or whirl-pool, that it draws every thing down with it, within it's &s;phere of action.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="336">This enormous &s;ea-animal, in all probability, is of the &s;tar-fi&s;h kind (which con&s;i&s;ts of a round body as a centre, without a head, from which extends eight or ten points or legs, re&s;embling the rays of a &s;tar.) And what we have called it's arms are more properly <HI>antennae,</HI> or feeling horns, with which it moves and gathers it's food, which con&s;i&s;ts of fi&s;hes. Tho&s;e who have ob|&s;erved it, have taken notice, that for &s;ome months the kraken is continually eating, and in other months con|tinually voiding it's excrements. During this evacua|tion, the &s;urface of the water is coloured and appears thick and turbid. This brings the fi&s;hes about him, when he feeds upon them, and after dige&s;tion converts them into baits for other fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Many &s;eafaring people have given accounts of float|ing i&s;lands, that is, &s;udden appearances of land which again as &s;uddenly vani&s;h, particularly in the north &s;ea.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the People.</HEAD>
<P>WE come now to &s;peak of the people of this coun|try, who were mo&s;t probably the followers of <HI>Odin,</HI> driven out of A&s;ia by <HI>Pompey</HI> the great, and who &s;pread them&s;elves to the north, as far as they found the country habitable. The famous di&s;trict Quaenanger, in the manor of Nordland, where the fabulous <HI>Rudbeck</HI> &s;uppo&s;es his northern Amagonian, or female republic, to have exi&s;ted, is well known. This republic, if any &s;uch there was, was driven with the ancient inhabitants of Norway, by the followers of <HI>Odin,</HI> into Finland. The petty kings of the&s;e more modern Norwegians, who then took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country were, in the tenth century, conquered by King <HI>Harold Harfagre,</HI> and &s;uch as would not &s;ubmit to him, left the country and fled to Iceland, Greenland, Ferroe, Shetland and the Orkneys, where they &s;ettled.</P>
<P>The Norwegians are in general robu&s;t, tall, well-made and lively. The pea&s;ants who live among the mountains, are generally taller than the re&s;t, and have
<PB N="318" REF="338">
a certain &s;everity in their countenance which commands re&s;pect, and &s;eems expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;trength of their in|tellectual faculties. Along the coa&s;t, they are not &s;o tall and robu&s;t, but more corpulent and plegmatic, and have a rounder vi&s;age. In mo&s;t parts of Norway, the air, which the pea&s;ants breathe, is clear, fre&s;h and whole&s;ome; their diet plain and homely, and as they undergo a great deal of labour, both by &s;ea and by land, and are naturally of a chearful di&s;po&s;ition, they have a con&s;tant &s;eries of good health, and more are found here upwards of 100 years of age, than in any other nation. They are inured to cold and hard&s;hips from their child|hood, and will run about bare-footed on the ice, in the latter end of November. The mountaineer wood-men have their beards often loaded with icicles and their bo|&s;oms filled with &s;now; and when their naked brea&s;ts are occa&s;ionally expo&s;ed, they &s;eem as hairy as their chins. On my travels, &s;ays <HI>Pontoppidan,</HI> over the highe&s;t mountains of Norway, which are covered with &s;now, where hou&s;es are of no &s;ervice, I have &s;een the pea&s;ants, in great numbers, do the work of hor&s;es, and indeed they &s;eem almo&s;t to equal tho&s;e animals in &s;trength. I have ob&s;erved, that when they have been in a profu&s;e &s;weat, they have thrown them&s;elves every half-hour upon the &s;now, to cool and refre&s;h them&s;elves, and have even &s;ucked it, to quench their thir&s;t. All this they undergo, without the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of a cold or fever, or without murmuring or betraying any di&s;|content. On the contrary, they go &s;inging on merrily
<PB N="319" REF="339">
all the while, and hold out for nine hours together, at the harde&s;t labour immaginable, with incredible chear|fulne&s;s and alacrity. How wi&s;ely has Providence en|dowed the&s;e people with con&s;titutions equal to their re|&s;pective wants! A remarkable in&s;tance of this may be &s;een on the i&s;lands near the coa&s;t, where the pea&s;ants of both &s;exes a&s;&s;emble by thou&s;ands, about the middle of January, to reap their winter-harve&s;t from the ocean. At the&s;e times, every family takes with them five or &s;ix weeks provi&s;ion, chiefly dried fi&s;h, keep out at &s;ea all day and great part of the night by moon-&s;hine, in open boats, and, after that, crowd together by &s;cores in|to little huts, where they lay down in their wet cloaths, and have &s;carce room to turn. Here they repo&s;e them|&s;elves the remainder of the night, and the next morn|ing return to the &s;ame laborious employment, with as much plea&s;ure and chearfulne&s;s, as if they were going to a merry-making.</P>
<P>The hair and eyes of the Norwegians are lighter than tho&s;e of mo&s;t other nations, and a dark complexion here, is as rare as a fair complexion in France or Italy; for we find that the clime changes here, and in all northern climes, hares, partridges and other animals, from a dark or brown colour to the fine&s;t white. The farther we proceed from the Equator, the more is the black colour of the inhabitants lo&s;t. They are &s;till pretty brown above the tropics; but we meet with none that are entirely white, till we get a great way into the
<PB N="320" REF="340">
temperate zones, and at the extremities of the&s;e zones, we find the faire&s;t complexions. The <HI>blonde</HI> or flaxen complexion of the Norway women, &s;trikes the eye of the admiring traveller, and he can &s;carcely believe, that the female he now beholds and the African he late|ly ca&s;t his eyes upon, are of the &s;ame &s;ex; but, beyond the temperate zone and where the frigid zone com|mences, the inhabitants lo&s;e their fair complexion and grow darker; for as exce&s;&s;ive heat darkens the &s;kin and gives the inhabitants of the torrid zone a tawny com|plexion, &s;o does exce&s;&s;ive cold the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The cold in Norway and Norden by no means ob|&s;tructs the growth of the body; obvious by the com|plete &s;tature of the people in the&s;e countries; whereas the Laplanders, Greenlanders and Samoiedes, are all a &s;hort thick-&s;et race, and of a dark-brown complexion, certainly occa&s;ioned by the inten&s;e cold in that climate&punc;</P>
<P>Daily experience &s;hews us, that every nation is, in &s;ome degree, characterized and di&s;tingui&s;hed by it's particular air, nouri&s;hment, education and manner of living. The Norwegians are in general dextrous, ac|tive, penetrating and ingenious, e&s;pecially in all kinds of mechanical performances. Every inhabitant is an artizan, and &s;upplies his family in all it's nece&s;&s;aries with his own manufactures; &s;o that there are few hat|ters, &s;hoe-makers, taylors, tanners, weavers, carpen|ters, &s;miths, or joiners by profe&s;&s;ion; all the&s;e trades

being carried on in every farm-hou&s;e, They never think a boy can be a u&s;eful member of &s;ociety, nor a good man, unle&s;s he is made ma&s;ter of all the&s;e.

Yet many of the&s;e mechanical pea&s;ants bring their work to &s;uch perfection, that it is hardly di&s;tingui&s;hable from town-made goods. At Hardanger, there are &s;everal country fellows that make their own violins, and &s;ome of them &s;o good, as fit to be played on in a concert. But this genius chiefly leads them to carving in wood all manner of devices, with their <HI>tolle-knive,</HI> being a &s;hort broad knife, of their own forging. Among others, a pea&s;ant, in the beginning of this century, who&s;e name was <HI>Halvor Fanden,</HI> excel|led &s;o much in this art, that connoi&s;&s;eurs would give their weight in &s;ilver for his carved cups and other works in ba&s;&s;o-relievo; and in the royal mu&s;eum at Denmark, they are con&s;idered as their greate&s;t artificial curio&s;ities. In the &s;ame mu&s;eum there is a bu&s;t of <HI>Chri&s;|tian</HI> V, carved in a certain wood called Been-wood, by a &s;hepherd, who in the year 1688, when the King went to Drontheim, &s;tood in the road to &s;ee his Maje&s;ty pa&s;s, and received &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion of his face, that he was able to repre&s;ent every lineament and feature to the life, without having ever &s;een the original but once <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant.</HI> At Arendal, they build &s;hips from two to three

<P>Formerly, the Norwegian youth, not only the com|mon people, but al&s;o tho&s;e in a more elevated &s;tation, were trained up to wre&s;tling, riding, &s;wimming, throwing the dart, &s;cating, climbing &s;teep rocks and forging iron. The other parts of their education con|&s;i&s;ted in writing the Runic character, blowing the horn, and compo&s;ing &s;ongs and odes; &s;o that every Norwegi|an pea&s;ant was an arti&s;t, a gentleman and a poet. It is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the &s;ame now. Next to &s;ounding the horn, which is a kind of a haut-boy, they have a mu&s;ical in&s;trument, which the farmers call <HI>lang-leek,</HI> having &s;ix bra&s;s wires &s;tretched upon a &s;ounding board about four feet long and &s;ix inches broad; but, though the pea&s;ants prefer it to a guitar or lute, it will hardly plea&s;e a delicate ear. But, the violin is their mo&s;t ad|mired in&s;trument, and is &s;ometimes u&s;ed in the hou&s;e of mourning, where they will &s;it at the head of the coffin, playing all day long, perhaps to drive away me|lancholy. They do the &s;ame, when the corps is carry|ing to church in a boat, which is frequent in the we&s;tern parts. But this is not &s;o &s;trange, as an old and &s;uper&s;ti|tious cu&s;tom in &s;ome places in the dioce&s;e of Chri&s;tian|&s;and, where they a&s;h the dead per&s;on why he died? If his wife was not kind to him, or his neighbours civil to him&punc; In &s;ome places in Lardal, in the dioce&s;e of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gen, every one that comes into the room where the
<PB N="323" REF="343">
corps is, falls on his knees at the coffin and begs for|givene&s;s of the decea&s;ed, if he has ever offended him. Their clergy frequently tell them of the ab&s;urdity of this, it being too late to a&s;k forgivene&s;s; but &s;o u&s;ed are they to their old cu&s;toms, that they find a difficulty to break it off.</P>
<P>The capacity of the Norwegians for literature is not inferior to their &s;kill in mechanics and bodily exerci&s;es. Had they the &s;ame opportunities for improvements, as their neighbours in Denmark, they would make an amazing progre&s;s. We may judge of this, by the children in Norway, who take their learning extremely fa&s;t, and are capable, in a very &s;hort time, to get a book by heart and comprehend the meaning of it. Every Norwegian pea&s;ant, e&s;pecially the freeholder that can pay his taxes, governs his hou&s;e and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons with as much power and authority as a nobleman: no one directs or controuls him. This gives them a certain freedom and genero&s;ity of mind; and if the li|beral arts had as much encouragement here as in &s;ome other countries, they would undoubtedly make a con|&s;iderable progre&s;s in a &s;hort time, and among a number of any other nation, the Norwegians would be found of a &s;uperior genius in the republic of letters. It is found by experience, that tho&s;e who live further up the coun|try, near Drontheim, are the mo&s;t ingenious. In con|ver&s;ing with the pea&s;ants about any &s;piritual or tempo|ral concerns, within their knowledge, we find them
<PB N="324" REF="344">
provided with judicious and pertinent an&s;wers; their que&s;tions are generally clear and rational, and their an|&s;wers di&s;cover great penetration and knowledge, &s;u|perior to many who have had all the advantages of edu|cation.</P>
<P>Another good quality ob&s;ervable in the Norwegians is civility and a courteous behaviour, being very oblig|ing and willing to &s;erve others. In this they do not fall &s;hort of the politene&s;s of the French, whom they re&s;emble more than any other nation. Their behavi|our is not affected but quite natural, and may be look|ed upon as the particular genius of the country. The Norwegian pea&s;ant, in point of politene&s;s, exceeds the Dani&s;h burgher; and the Norwegian burgher, e&s;peci|ally of the mercantile cla&s;s, in this re&s;pect, equals at lea&s;t the Dani&s;h nobility. As to fidelity and hone&s;ty they are not le&s;s practi&s;ed here than in other countries. In &s;hort, the Norwegians, &s;ays <HI>Mole&s;worth,</HI> are a faith|ful, hone&s;t people, and in their loyalty, the throne of Denmark has found it's chief &s;upport. As a proof of their valour and fidelity to their king and country, I will only, &s;ays <HI>Pontoppidan,</HI> give an in&s;tance or two in a late war; I mean the zeal of tho&s;e citizens that fired their own hou&s;es to di&s;lodge the enemy; and the pea|&s;ants who di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves about, in the rocks and defiles, with their fire-arms, to cut off their retreat and did not &s;uffer them to pa&s;s, without being remarkably weakened. In the year 1716, when the Swedi&s;h army
<PB N="325" REF="345">
had invaded Norway, whil&s;t one of the governors of a fortification on the frontiers, was lying near a na|vigable river, with his corps, which was greatly weak|ened, waiting for fre&s;h tran&s;ports from Denmark, there came a number of grey-headed farmers to him and of|fered them&s;elves, with all their accoutrements, as vo|lunteers for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. There came, one day particularly, a body of 300 &s;uch volunteers, from Tellemarken, who were vigorous and in good &s;pirits, with fire-arms and three weeks provi&s;ion in their knap|&s;acks, and thus acco&s;ted him,
<Q>Good day, father; we hear that you have got &s;trange unwelcome gue&s;ts, that you want to get rid off; if you have a mind to make u&s;e of us, only tell what we are to do, and you &s;hall &s;ee that we are <HI>men.</HI></Q>
It was the&s;e pea&s;ants who were commanded by Captain <HI>Coucheron,</HI> in the action of Krog-wood, when the Swedes endeavoured to force a pa&s;&s;age through, and were repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of 200 men; but the Norwegians, who were well po&s;ted, did not lo&s;e a man.</P>
<P>The &s;kill of the Norwegians in maritime affairs is well known; they have a genius for all warlike em|ployments, are not ea&s;ily repul&s;ed, but will &s;upport the honour of their country and undergo the greate&s;t fa|tigues with very little re&s;t or nouri&s;hment. The Nor|wegian army con&s;i&s;ts of 30,000 effective men, be&s;ides 14 or 15,000 &s;ailors, which all Europe can hardly match.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="346">It is a pity that &s;uch hardy veterans &s;hould ever quar|rel among them&s;elves. In former times they would carry their revengeful di&s;po&s;ition &s;o far, that in a party-quarrel the common pea&s;ants, would &s;tand upon their point of honour and fight it out with their knives; and before they began, would hook them&s;elves to|gether by their belts, then draw their knives and would, not be parted, till one or the other was mortally wound|ed or killed. This bruti&s;h cu&s;tom prevailed in Nor|way, till about the middle of the la&s;t century, to &s;uch a degree, that they &s;ay, when a pea&s;ant with his family was invited to a wedding, the wife generally took her hu&s;band's &s;hrowd with her, becau&s;e on the&s;e occa&s;ions, they &s;eldom parted before they were intoxicated with liquor, the con&s;equence of which was fighting and this &s;eldom ended without murder. Some of the pea&s;ants who have put away the&s;e in&s;truments and broke them|&s;elves of this wicked cu&s;tom, &s;till retain that revenge|ful &s;pirit and that in&s;olence and pride which were the promoters of it; however, they make u&s;e now of a le&s;s pernicious in&s;trument and employ the lawyer's pen in|&s;tead of a knife. They are very ob&s;tinate and will per|&s;i&s;t in their animo&s;ities to the la&s;t, and if a poor man has it not in his power to pur&s;ue his &s;uit, his neighbours will often make a collection to enable him to do it.</P>
<P>But with the foregoing fault, there is a commen|dable ambition in the Norwegian pea&s;ant, which makes him &s;trive to live independent of his friends; and if his
<PB N="327" REF="347">
freehold be incumbered he u&s;es his utmo&s;t efforts to clear and redeem it. There are many not a little proud of being thought to be de&s;cended from noble families, and this ridiculous vanity prevents them from marry|ing their children very advantageou&s;ly, by &s;tanding upon their blood and birth. They are fond of being re&s;pected and honoured to the utmo&s;t, and the great complai&s;ance they &s;hew to others is not without a view of having it returned. From the &s;ame &s;ource, &s;prings the Norwegian's de&s;ire to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in his &s;tati|on, by fine cloaths, an elegant hou&s;e, &amp;c. This is very con&s;picuous in mo&s;t trading-hou&s;es, where commerce gives them an opportunity of conver&s;ing with foreign|ers, e&s;pecially the Engli&s;h, whom they chiefly endea|vour to imitate, and for want of abilites to equal us in &s;plendor, magnificent entertainments, furniture and equipages, a great many ruin them&s;elves. The Ber|gen merchants indeed, who are mo&s;t of them de&s;cended from the frugal Dutch or Germans, continue &s;till in that way, like good &s;ober trade&s;men.</P>
<P>But, though the Norwegians endeavour to follow the Engli&s;h in the&s;e particulars, and in a conceited opinion of their own country, yet they are very unlike us in friend&s;hip and ho&s;pitality; for there is no country in the world, where the people are &s;o ho&s;pitable, liberal and &s;o willing to &s;erve and oblige &s;trangers, as they are in Norway. A traveller is &s;eldom &s;uffered to pay for his lodging, which may partly proceed from the
<PB N="328" REF="348">
few per&s;ons who vi&s;it tho&s;e parts; they therefore think it a duty to treat the &s;tranger, as well as it is in their power, and look upon it as an honour done them, if he accepts of their civilities. Notwith&s;tanding all this, the pea&s;ant never gives the upper end of the table to the greate&s;t gue&s;t, he thinking that place belongs only to him&s;elf. They keep open hou&s;e for three weeks at Chri&s;tmas, &s;et out the be&s;t things they can afford and load their tables during the whole time. Nay, on Chri&s;tmas-eve, they invite the very birds to the fe&s;tivi|ty, and hang out at the barn-doors, on a pole, an un|thre&s;hed &s;heaf of corn, for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>As the Norw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gian thus contributes to the good and happine&s;s of others, &s;o he al&s;o endeavours to make him|&s;elf chearful and always to appear good-natured. Envy and di&s;content are here bani&s;hed to the rich and great, who&s;e temporal advantages are rather a plague than a comfort. The little the common people have to in|dulge in, reli&s;hes and agrees with them and they enjoy it, though it be plain and homely; except it be in public companies and entertainments, where they are rather too much inclined to drink. But they are tem|perate in their daily meals, have no &s;uperfluity and, therefore, mo&s;t of them live to a great age; many to 80 or 90, &s;ome to 100 or 120 years. In the year 1751, in the dioce&s;e of Aggerhuus only, 136 per&s;ons had reached 80 years of age, 41 had reached 90 and four were upwards of 100. In 1733, when <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> VI.
<PB N="329" REF="349">
and his royal con&s;ort vi&s;ited their Norwegian dominions, they took up their re&s;idence in the hou&s;e of Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Colbior&s;en,</HI> in Frederick&s;hald, who was de&s;ir|ous of diverting his royal gue&s;ts, with what they call a jubilee wedding. This was performed in the garden under tents pitched for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>There were four couple married, being country-peo|ple invited from the adjacent parts, and out of all the&s;e were none under 100 years of age, who all of them lived &s;everal years afterwards. The&s;e eight married people made them&s;elves exceedingly merry on the oc|ca&s;ion, and danced with green wreaths on their heads, which brides always wear on their wedding-day. This is &s;o extraordinary an in&s;tance of longevity, as is not to be met with in the hi&s;tory of any other country.</P>
<P>Though Norway is in general a very healthy country, yet it is not exempted from it's peculiar di&s;ea&s;es. Among the di&s;ea&s;es that mo&s;t appear in the dioce&s;e of Bergen, which is the mo&s;t unhealthful &s;pot in all Norway, is a kind of itch, probably owing to the peo|ple eating a great quantity of fat fi&s;h; it is a kind of lepro&s;y that breaks out in ugly boils on the face. They have al&s;o a di&s;ea&s;e called <HI>allevilde;</HI> which &s;eizes the pa|tient at fir&s;t with violent &s;hooting pains, flying from one part of the body to another, and often breaking out into &s;ores and ulcers. Another is <HI>begavning,</HI> a kind of epilep&s;y, but &s;eldom &s;o violent as in other countries,
<PB N="330" REF="350">
which &s;ome attribute to the eider-down beds they lie on. They have cures however for them all, except a cer|tain fever, which the pea&s;ants call <HI>land&s;ar&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> which appears &s;eldom, but is contagious and epidemic; it is &s;omething like the di&s;temper which &s;oldiers are apt to catch when encamped on damp places: it is malignant and painful, and when it rages, carries off great num|bers.</P>
<P>We will now &s;peak of their food and manner of liv|ing. In the article of diet there is a great difference between tho&s;e who live in the country and the inhabi|tants of trading-towns, a great part of which con&s;i&s;t of Danes, Germans, Dutch and Engli&s;h, who make their bread and dre&s;s their victuals in the Dani&s;h fa&s;hion. They have almo&s;t all &s;orts of provi&s;ions here in perfec|tion, except butchers meat, which is not very plentiful. As for wild-fowl, all &s;orts of game and all kinds of fi&s;h, except carp, they have, in as great abundance as in any other country in Europe. Milk is very good and rich, and as to wines, &s;pices, &amp;c, greater quantities of the&s;e are imported than there is occa&s;ion for, or good economy requires. Mo&s;t merchants live here in a more elegant manner than the <HI>noble&s;&s;e</HI> of other countries. All kinds of wines are &s;o common in Norway, that it may be que&s;tioned whether more is not con&s;umed there in private families, than even in the wine-coun|tries.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="351">The pea&s;ant in Norway, as in other places, keeps clo&s;e to the cu&s;toms and manner of living of his fore|fathers, and as he follows them in other things, &s;o does he in his modes of eating and drinking. Bread, which is the chief &s;upport of life, is not made of rye, among the pea&s;ants, except on fe&s;tivals, but of oatmeal, and in flat round cakes, extremely thin and large as a &s;mall di&s;h, and they call it <HI>flad-brod;</HI> it much re&s;embles our &s;ea-bi&s;cuits and will keep a year, if put in a dry place. Some reckon the olde&s;t to be the be&s;t, and in former times, &s;he was e&s;teemed a good hou&s;ewife that &s;aved for her &s;on's wedding, a piece of bread that &s;he had baked for his chri&s;tening.</P>
<P>When grain is &s;carce, as it &s;ometimes happens to be after a &s;evere winter, the pea&s;ants are obliged to have recour&s;e to an old cu&s;tom, as a di&s;agreeable but &s;ure method of pre&s;erving life. Their bread, in time of &s;carcity, is thus made. They take the back of the fir-tree, boil it and dry it before the fire, then grind it to meal and mix a little oatmeal with it. It has a bitter and re&s;inous ta&s;te, and does not afford much nouri&s;hment; but even in the mo&s;t plentiful times they will occa&s;ion|ally eat it, that they may be prepared again&s;t a time of &s;carcity, which does not happen once in a century. In the province of Bergen, which is the mo&s;t barren, there is lea&s;t rea&s;on to complain, as they import a great deal of grain from Denmark and places round the Baltick and keep their magazines full. Such Norwegians as
<PB N="332" REF="352">
live by the &s;ea-&s;ide, like the Icelanders and Finlaps, eat dried &s;tock-fi&s;h by way of bread.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants make them&s;elves a kind of ha&s;ty-pud|ding of oatmeal and barley meal, which they call &s;oup, and in which they will &s;ometimes boil a pickled herring or a half-&s;alted mackrell or &s;almon.</P>
<P>They are better provided in Norway with fre&s;h fi&s;h than in mo&s;t countries. They have al&s;o plenty of grow&s;e, partridges, hares, red-deer, rain-deer, &amp;c. They al&s;o kill cows, &s;heep and goats, for winter-&s;tock, which they pickle, cut in thin &s;lices, dry in the wind and eat like hung-beef. This they call <HI>&s;karke,</HI> and it requires a ploughman's &s;tomach to dige&s;t it. Their general drink is &s;mall beer in winter, milk and water in &s;ummer, and good &s;trong beer at Chri&s;tmas; and, they are fond of &s;moking tobacco.</P>
<P>The Norwegians who live in towns have nothing re|markable or particular in their dre&s;s, but the pea&s;ants differ much from the&s;e; tho&s;e which are called &s;trile-farmers, have their breeches and &s;tockings all of a piece, &s;omething like the Hu&s;&s;ars, with a wide loo&s;e jacket made of a coar&s;e woolen cloth called <HI>vadmel.</HI> Their wai&s;tcoats are of the &s;ame, and &s;ome that will appear finer than ordinary, cover the &s;eams and put a border all round, of the &s;ame &s;ort of &s;tuff, but of a different colour, which looks like lace and has a gay appearance.

The Hardanger pea&s;ants are particular for wearing black clothes edged with red, which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from their neighbours. The Vaa&s;&s;erne wear all black, and the &s;trile pea&s;ants wear white edged with black; about Soynefiord, they wear black and yellow, &s;o that the inhabitants almo&s;t of every pari&s;h in the province, vary in the colour of their cloaths.</P>
<P>They all wear a hat &s;lapped all round, or a little, brown, grey or black cap on their heads; this la&s;t is a &s;ort of quarter-cap, made quite round and the &s;eams are ornamented with black ribbands. They have &s;hoes of a peculiar fa&s;hion, without heels or &s;oles, which con|&s;i&s;t of two pieces, the upper leather, which &s;ets clo&s;e to the foot, to which the other is joined in a great many plaits or folds. In winter, and when they travel, they wear a &s;ort of half-boots, that reach up to the calves of their legs; the&s;e are laced on one &s;ide &s;omething like a Roman bu&s;kin. When they travel on the rocks in the &s;now, that they may not &s;ink too deep, they put on what they call <HI>truvieres,</HI> which are round like the hoop of a &s;mall barrel, worked acro&s;s with twigs or wicker, and this keeps them up; but as this way of travelling is trouble&s;ome, when they have a long way to go, they put on &s;cates about as broad as the foot, but &s;ix or eight feet long, and pointed before; the&s;e are covered underneath with &s;eals &s;kin, &s;o that the &s;mooth grain of the hair turns backward towards the heel, &s;uch as they travel with in Lapland. With the&s;e &s;now-&s;kates they
<PB N="334" REF="355">
run about on the &s;now as well as they can upon the ice, and fa&s;ter than any hor&s;e can go; with which the corps of &s;oldiers, called <HI>keir-lobere,</HI> or &s;caters, in time of war, march with great expedition like the Hu&s;&s;ars.</P>
<P>A Norway pea&s;ant never wears a neckcloth or any thing of the kind, except when he is dre&s;&s;ed; for his neck and brea&s;t are always open, and he &s;uffers the &s;now to beat into his bo&s;om, which he e&s;teems an orna|ment; but on the contrary, he covers the veins in his wri&s;t clo&s;e, to keep them warm, binding them round with a woolen fillet, which goes &s;everal times round the wri&s;t, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to contribute to their &s;trength. About their body they wear a broad leather belt, orna|mented with convex bra&s;s plates; to this belt hangs a bra&s;s chain, which holds their <HI>tolle-knive,</HI> or their large knife, gimlet and other tackle.</P>
<P>The womens dre&s;s has likewi&s;e it's di&s;tinctions; when at church and genteel a&s;&s;emblies, they wear jackets laced clo&s;e, with leather girdles and &s;ilver ornaments about them, worth &s;ixteen or twenty rix-dollars. They wear al&s;o a &s;ilver chain, three or four times round the neck, with a gilt medal hanging at the end of it. Their handkerchiefs and caps are almo&s;t covered with &s;mall &s;ilver, bra&s;s and tin-plate buttons, and large rings &s;uch as they wear on their fingers, to which they hang again a parcel of &s;mall ones, which look brilliant and make a gingling noi&s;e when they move.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="356">A maiden bride has her hair platted, and hung as full as po&s;&s;ible with &s;uch kind of trinkets, as al&s;o her clothes.

<P>In &s;ome trading-cities, e&s;pecially at Bergen and Chri&s;tiana, they have begun to build &s;tone hou&s;es, but their hou&s;es in general are built of fir and pine-trees, the whole trunks of which are u&s;ed in building, being laid one upon another, and only chopped even, to make them lie clo&s;e; at the corners they are mortai&s;ed, &s;o that they never give way. The&s;e trunks are left round as they grow, both in&s;ide the hou&s;e and out&s;ide, and are frequently boarded over and painted, which gives them a genteel appearance. The inhabitants of Ber|gen do not tru&s;t goods of value, which are not in con|&s;tant u&s;e, in their dwelling hou&s;es, but keep them in warehou&s;es out of the town.</P>
<P>In country-villages, they do not build their hou&s;es adjoining to each other, but in the manner of a great many towns in Switzerland and Holland, every hou&s;e &s;tanding by it&s;elf, with their fields and grounds about them; and there are &s;ome farm-hou&s;es that look like &s;mall villages, but they are generally let to three, four or five families, and frequently con&s;i&s;t of &s;ix, eight or
<PB N="336" REF="357">
ten &s;eparate apartments, and the <HI>&s;tavburet,</HI> or magazine for all the provi&s;ions, is generally placed at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the dwelling-hou&s;e, for fear of fire. It &s;tands very high upon poles, to keep the provi&s;ions dry and pre&s;erve them from mice and other vermin. The kitchen, where they cook and brew, &s;tands al&s;o &s;epa|rate, as do the barns, hay-lofts, cow-hou&s;es, &s;tables and the like. Such a farm has generally a mill belong|ing to it, &s;ituated by &s;ome rivulet, be&s;ides a &s;mith's forge, for every farmer is his own &s;mith. At Sund|moer and other places in that dioce&s;e, are frequently &s;een &s;ome lonely hou&s;es on the tops of high mountains, &s;urrounded with rugged and &s;teep-projecting rocks, &s;o that there are few ca&s;tles &s;o inacce&s;&s;ible; for there is of|ten but one way to come at them, which is by &s;mall &s;teps and here and there &s;ome wooden pegs fixed; &s;o that the a&s;cent is very dangerous, and few people ven|ture up, that are not u&s;ed to them. Up in the coun|try, where timber for building is but of very little va|lue, there is many a farm-hou&s;e as large and hand&s;ome as a nobleman's &s;eat. The dwelling-hou&s;e frequently is two &s;tories high, having a railed balcony in the front, with hand&s;ome windows and the rooms wain&s;coted.</P>
<P>Windows in Norway are new things, and &s;eldom &s;een in pea&s;ants hou&s;es, for on this &s;ide of Filefield, in the whole dioce&s;e of Bergen, it is rare, even among the rich farmers, to &s;ee what they call a <HI>glar-&s;tuerne,</HI> that is a dwelling-hou&s;e with windows.

receive their light at the top, which is about the height of the room, where a &s;quare hole is made in the middle. In &s;ummer and fine weather, they leave this hole quite open, but in, winter or wet weather, it is &s;topped up with a wooden frame, over which is &s;trained the inward membrane of &s;ome animal, which is as &s;trong and tran&s;parent as a bladder. This light is lifted off, or put on, with a pole, which is reckoned a mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary piece of furniture in every farm-hou&s;e. Tho&s;e who come to a farm-hou&s;e, on any important bu&s;ine&s;s, e&s;pecially court&s;hip, mu&s;t lay hold of this pole, before they utter a word.

This cu&s;tom, one would &s;uppo&s;e, would be very hurtful to the eyes, but it is not &s;o; for the &s;moke, meeting with no ob&s;truction, &s;oon ri&s;es above a man's head, and it &s;eldom falls &s;o low in the&s;e rooms as in many that have chimnies.</P>
<P>Under this light-hole generally &s;tands a long thick table, and benches of the &s;ame wood. At the upper end of the table is the <HI>hoy-&s;oedet,</HI> or high &s;eat, which be|longs to the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e only, who al&s;o has a little cupboard for his own u&s;e, in which he locks up all his trea&s;ures. In towns they cover their hou&s;es with tiles; but in the country, they lay over the boards the &s;appy bark of birch-trees, which will not decay for many years. They cover this again with turf, three or four inches thick, which keeps the hou&s;e clo&s;e and warm. Sometimes you may &s;ee &s;ervice-trees and al|ways

good gra&s;s growing upon the turf, which induces the goats to leap about and climb up there for good pa&s;ture; and many a farmer mows it and gets a pretty good quantity of hay, from the top of his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Commerce or trading with foreign nations, has for many ages flouri&s;hed in Norway. Forty or fifty &s;ail of merchant-men, deeply laden from different parts of the world, come annually into Bergen harbour in the &s;pring, and about 800 &s;hips loaded with the produce of the country &s;ail out of it, and two or three hundred &s;ail are &s;een lying there at a time. Drontheim, Chri&s;tiana and Bragnaes, are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable trading cities of this kingdom, next to Bergen, who&s;e trade is very con|&s;iderable to all parts of Europe, and, on a moderate calculation, brings in more than 100,000 rix-dollars a year. The produce of Norway exported is copper, both wrought and unwrought, iron ca&s;t into cannon, &s;toves and pots, or forged into bars, lead, though but in &s;mall quantities, ma&s;ts, timber, deal-boards, planks, marble, veeg-&s;tone, mill-&s;tones, and &s;eyl-&s;tones. Va|rity of fi&s;h is al&s;o exported, as cod, herring, &s;almon, ling, flounders, and lob&s;ters; al&s;o cow-hides, &s;ea-calf-&s;kins, goat-&s;kins, &s;ome dre&s;&s;ed into cordovan leather; various kinds of coar&s;e and fine furs of bears, wolves, foxes, beavers, ermins and martens; eider-down and other feathers; butter, tallow, train-oil, tar, juniper and &s;everal other &s;orts of berries and nuts; &s;alt, allum, gla&s;s, vitriol and pot-a&s;hes. All the above-named
<PB N="339" REF="360">
products of Norway, (fi&s;h, timber and metals excepted) may, upon a well-founded calculation, amount to three millions of rix-dollars yearly.</P>
<P>This nation has a genius for trade and navigation, though, as hath been before ob&s;erved, their &s;plendid manner of living in &s;ome places is an ob&s;truction to it. Norwegian youths are &s;ent to Engli&s;h, French and Dutch merchants' 'counting-hou&s;es, to improve them|&s;elves and learn the language, and &s;ome young people go there, from the &s;ame parts, for a year or two, for a &s;imilar purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>As every inhabitant of Norway is an arti&s;t, and wants not the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any profe&s;&s;ed mechanic, &s;uch trades are not very general. For this rea&s;on, there are but two cities in the heart of the country, which are Ko|ning&s;berg and Roraas; all the re&s;t are &s;ituated upon the coa&s;t. All fine and curious works are imported from Holland and England; though the Norwegians begin to improve in &s;uch articles, and by degrees find the advantage of it, e&s;pecially in joiners and cabinet-maker's work. Agriculture is carried on, more or le&s;s, every where. Some farmers export their corn, but many more are obliged to buy more than half they u&s;e, and he is accounted a good farmer, who can grow enough to &s;upply his own family. This, in a great mea&s;ure proceeds from the pea&s;ants choo&s;ing rather to work in the woods, or at the fi&s;heries, than be em|ployed
<PB N="340" REF="361">
in agriculture; but, as they begin now to im|prove the wa&s;te grounds more than ever, a little time will make a great alteration. But the Lord of Nature having di&s;tributed various di&s;&s;imilar means of living among different nations, that one may have need of the other, and that one country may di&s;po&s;e of it's &s;u|per&s;luities to another, and import other things which it wants at home; I &s;ay, this con&s;idered, perhaps things are as well as they &s;tand. For, if Norway was to pro|duce a &s;ufficient quantity of corn, &s;o as not to want foreign grain, Denmark would not probably know where to di&s;po&s;e of it's &s;uperfluity in that commodity. Grazing and breeding cattle is the chief part of the farmer's employment, by which, he not only &s;upplies his own wants, but derives a profit, by &s;ending them to market. In the mountains, the pea&s;ants make gra|zing almo&s;t their only occupation, and &s;end their cat|tle (as has been ob&s;erved,) to a great di&s;tance to gra&s;s, in fruitful &s;pots, or on the tops of mountains, or in the valleys, or along the rivulets that run between the hills.</P>
<P>Cutting of wood, &s;elling and floating of timber, burning charcoal, extracting tar, and every thing that belongs to the woods is the principal employment of the pea&s;ants of Norway. Of woods that belong to the public and are no one's peculiar property, they have the wood, &amp;c. for their labour, and generally &s;tay there for &s;everal weeks together, taking as much pro|vi&s;ion
<PB N="341" REF="362">
with them, as they can carry, or having it &s;ent af|ter them. When the timber is felled and cut, they are obliged to leave behind a great deal of the lop, to rot. The large timber they draw away in the winter, to the neare&s;t river or lake, by a hor&s;e or two fa&s;tened to each piece, and in the &s;pring, the merchants or their agents are there to receive it, and order it be floated where they think proper. In this work, as well as at the &s;aw-mills, and preparing wood for faggots, making &s;taves for ca&s;ks, and hoops for the fi&s;heries, great numbers are employed, and &s;till greater, in burn|ing of charcoal. Of charcoal, va&s;t quantities mu&s;t be delivered to the melting furnaces within the di&s;tance of eighteen miles, at a fixed price, <HI>viz.</HI> at 2<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> Eng|gli&s;h per la&s;t, each la&s;t con&s;i&s;ting of twelve tons, and each ton, two &s;eet &s;quare. If this privilege was not granted to the mines, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to work them.</P>
<P>The roots of the fir-trees, which have &s;tood &s;everal years in the ground, after the trees have been cut down and thus imbibed the fatne&s;s of the &s;oil, they burn for tar; this they do in the open fields, and carry it to the &s;ea-port towns for exportation.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;ilver, copper, and iron-works which af|ford a livelihood to many thou&s;ands in Norway, as hath before been &s;hewn, great numbers are employed in na|vigation and fi&s;hing, and maintain them&s;elves by the&s;e
<PB N="342" REF="363">
occupations. Hence all the pea&s;ants that live near the &s;ea, are &s;o accu&s;tomed to it, from their childhood, that like amphibious animals, they cannot live without row|ing or dabbling about in the water. Mr. <HI>Leeganger,</HI> the mini&s;ter of Kar&s;und, declares, that during the time he had the pari&s;h of Ud&s;ire, which was fifty years, not above ten grown men died a&s;hore, the re&s;t having been drowned at &s;ea.</P>
<P>Hunting, &s;hooting and bird-catching, afford &s;ome of the people of Norway a comfortable livelihood, for every one is at liberty to pur&s;ue the game on the wa|ters, without controul. The be&s;t mark&s;men live in the mountains; but, the&s;e hunters, in times of di&s;tre&s;s, will &s;ometimes fall upon the farmers, and partly by threats, and partly by begging, oblige them to relieve their nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>Having now treated of the people in general, their manner of living, employments and occupations, I will clo&s;e this account of Norway, with &s;ome few remarks on the nobility and freeholders of the country. Of the nobility, there are but few left, for which this rea&s;on may be a&s;&s;igned, that a nobleman's e&s;tate has not the privileges belonging to the deme&s;ne of the nobility, longer than it is inhabited by the lord in per&s;on. For|merly, the nobles were very powerful here, and con|&s;i&s;ted of dukes, earls and barons, but they are now re|duced to a few. Indeed, &s;ince the &s;overeignty of Den|mark,
<PB N="343" REF="364">
&s;ome Norwegian families have been ennobled whil&s;t many of the families of the ancient nobility are reduced to the cla&s;s of pea&s;ants. The&s;e however, are not wanting in family pride, and pick up all the intel|ligence they can by tradition, &amp;c. of their pedigree, and publi&s;h it in &s;ome of their funeral &s;ermons, where the whole genealogy is generally traced, and, the e&s;|curcheons pre&s;erved in &s;ome of their hou&s;es, as a mark of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of the&s;e foibles, every freeholder in Nor|way has vanity enough to con&s;ider him&s;elf as noble, by right of inheritance. There are &s;everal pea&s;ants, who now inhabit the hou&s;e which they can make appear their ance&s;tors po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and inhabited for 3 or 400 years before them; for, according to the Norwegian law, (which differs in this from the Dani&s;h,) no free|hold can be alienated by &s;ale, or any other way from him, who has the right of inheritance. If he &s;ells it and has it not in his power to redeem it, he mu&s;t de|clare every tenth year at the &s;e&s;&s;ions, that the want of money is the only rea&s;on; and, if he ever &s;urmounts that difficulty, or if he or his heirs, to the &s;econd or third generation, be able to redeem it, then he who inhabits it is con&s;idered only as a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, <HI>pro tempore,</HI> and mu&s;t turn out immediately, and give up the premi&s;es to the right inheritor. For this rea&s;on, they keep a &s;trict account of their pedigree, that when occa&s;ion of|fers, they may have recour&s;e to it.</P>
